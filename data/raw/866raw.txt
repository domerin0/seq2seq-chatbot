that bass player' s a babe .

don' t buzz me , all right ?
uhh !
uhh !
uhh !
uhh !
uhh !
uhh !
oh , no !
russell , stop the tape .
so , what do you think ?
i think it' s two chimps on a davenport in a basement .
i' m not sponsoring this .
i got spots on love boat , but this ?
what is this ?
mr. vanderhoff , this is your audience .
they' re the same kids that line up at noah' s arcade .
it looks so cheesy .
that' s where i come in .
russell' s our best producer .
he does chicago p. m. with elaine ronkey ,
sunshine saturday , the african american digest .
never heard of that .
it' s on very late .
it won several awards .
i think i' il stick with love boat .
if i may , speaking from a producer / director standpoint , kids can relate to this show .
these guys aren' t phonies .
kids can spot phonies .
they' re very smart .
kids know dick .
i watch them in my arcades .
they stand like laboratory rats hitting the feeder bar to get food pellets .
as long as they pump in quarters , who gives a shit ?
let me ask you something .
what' s your single biggest problem in the arcade business ?
well , uh , keeping the customer informed of new product .
like , we have a new game called zantar .
zantar is a gelatinous cube that eats warriors in a medieval village .
every time it eats a chieftain you ascend to a higher level .
beauty part is you can' t get to the next level .
the kids keep coughing up quarters .
gelatinous cube eats village
i think it' s terrific .
you know , i know nothing about video games .
i found what you just said riveting .
well , i do my own commercials .
i did not know that .
i don' t mention the games in the commercials because the technology moves much faster than the advertising .
i did not realize that .
russell , did you realize that ?
no , i did not realize that .
so , mr. vanderhoff ,
let me see if i' m hearing you correctly .
are you saying that if you had a spot , say on a weekly show , that you could come on the show and update the kids on exactly what was new in your arcade ?
yeah , that' s it .
i' m impressed .
wow !
noah' s arcade presents wayne' s world .
i think that' s brilliant .
brilliant .
well , thank you .
we' il get right to work on this .
we' il send the contracts over to your office .
we' il be in touch .
oh .
i' d like to think about this .
oh , of course you would .
i wouldn' t have it any other way .
she' il validate .
thank you .
he' s in .
stop it !
you' re scaring me .
oh , cool .
you' re learning cassandra' s language .
i' ve never seen you so mental over a girl before .
you going to marry her ?
marriage is punishment for shoplifting in some countries .
o. k. , you passed inspection .
all right .
just barely .
uh , o. k. , that' s 42 . 57 , wayne parts and labor .
no way .
brutal .
oh , o. k. there you go .
all right , we got it .
that' s not enough .
what ?
we got ... that .
that' s good , but i need more .
oh , man !
why don' t you use a gun ?
it' s not my fault .
come on .
i suppose it' s society' s fault ?
more .
cool .
all right .
here' s an extra dollar .
you guys should have been at gasworks on friday .
yeah , we were there .
there was this band crucial taunt
they had this megababe for a lead singer .
unreal !
phil , we were there .
have you gone mental ?
hello ?
i think we should go now .
here you go .
cool !
you think it' s wise to sell a show we don' t own ?
by tonight , we will .
ah !
excuse me .
do you know where we could find wayne campbell ?
that' d be privileged information .
we just want to know where they broadcast from .
are you a friend or a relative ?
we' re neither .
russell , i may not have grown up around here , but i understand these people .
this must be the place .
o. k. , we' re just about out of time , right ?
but first let' s give a wayne' s world salute to the guess jeans girl claudia schiffer .
schwing !
schwing !
tent pole !
she' s a babe .
she' s magically babe licious .
she tested very high on the strokability scale .
mmrreowww !
ssss .
are you through yet ?
i' m getting tired of holding this .
yeah , that' s what she said .
o. k. , so , claudia schiffer , we salute you .
scha wing !
scha wing !
that' s all the time we have this week .
until then , good night .
party on , wayne .
wayne' s world wayne' s world

and ... we' re clear .
o. k. excellent show , everyone .

wayne , benjamin kane .
regional program director for oliver communications .
oh , hello .
i' m russell finley .
we spoke earlier today .
hi .
maybe we can go somewhere and get acquainted .
russell , get to know the crew .
you know anywhere nice ?
hi .
hi .
let me get this out of the way
i' m a big fan .
you are ?
as i see it , your show' s capable of so much more .
we' il try harder , o. k. ?
give us a second chance .
don' t cancel us without a second chance .
garth , relax , all right ?
your pills ?
he can' t cancel us .
we' re on public access .
can i be honest ?
my job , it' s usually such a bore , but the other day something incredible happened .
what happened ?
noah vanderhoff , owner of the largest video arcade chain in chicago , is in my office asking me what' s with this show wayne' s world
i hear so much about ?
i have your shows on tape .
i said i' m a fan .
i put a show in .
he literally jumped out of his seat .
cool .
cool .
he wants to sponsor the show , put you on our station , and pay you a huge salary .
he doesn' t realize you' re both artists .
you' re not interested in money .
no , we' re not interested in money .
that' s what i told him .
but he said take them two cashier' s checks anyway so they know i' m serious .
i may be wasting my time , but here i am with the contract and two cashier' s checks for $5, 000 each .
exsqueeze me ?
baking powder ?
you' re going to pay us for doing wayne' s world ?
give me the word .
i' il tear up these checks .
no !
no !
he shoots , he scores !
want to look at the contracts ?
yes .
do you have a lawyer ?
yes .
uh ... no .
we' re between lawyers right now .
our first lawyer screwed our affairs so badly .
that' s right .
i walked right into that office ,
i grabbed him by his big fat head , and i said i' m not going to jail for you or anybody .
exactly .
can i have an opportunity to peruse that contract before we sign it ?
hmm .
yes .
yes .
i like what you' ve done here .
ah .
hmm .
yes .
yes .
um , i dropped my pen .
i' m not so sure about ...
oh , i see .
i see .
hi .
um , does this seem weird ?
why does this guy have contracts ?
ever see the twilight zone where the guy signed a contract , they cut out his tongue , put it in a jar , and it wouldn' t die ?
it grew and pulsated and gave birth to baby tongues .
pretty cool , huh ?
i got to go .
i like this part .
i feel we can work with you on this project .
you' ve made mr. vanderhoff a very happy man .
to wayne' s world .

cha ching .
have you spoken to wayne about the vanderhoff spot ?
yes .
briefly .
he was not very receptive .
oh , really ?
well , i' il explain to him that it' s not a choice , that it' s in his contract .
oh .
well , wayne will understand that right away .
not .
excuse me .
i mean , there' s two darrin stevens , right ?
dick york , dick sargent .
yeah , right , as if we wouldn' t notice .
well , hold on .
dick york .
dick sargent .
sergeant york .
wow , that' s weird .
wayne .
listen , we need to have a talk about vanderhoff .
the fact is , he' s the sponsor and you signed a contract guaranteeing him certain concessions , one of them being a spot on the show .
that' s where i see things just a little differently .
contract or no , i will not bow to any sponsor .
i' m sorry you feel that way , but basically , it' s the nature of the beast .
maybe i' m wrong on this one , but for me , the beast doesn' t include selling out .
garth , you know what i' m talking about , right ?
it' s , like , people only do things because they get paid , and that' s just really sad .
i can' t talk about it anymore .
it' s giving me a headache .
here .
take two of these .
ah .
nuprin .

yeah .
i got paid today .
oh , yeah , i know what that' s like .
no .
you don' t understand .
they laid me off .
i got one of these .
i know how that feels .
know what i' d like to do ?
yeah , i know what you' d like to do
find the guy that did it , rip his still beating heart out of his chest and show him how black it is before he dies .
actually , i was thinking about filing a grievance with the union .
well , the world' s a twisted place .
hi .
hey , garth .
how' s it going ?
good .
hey .
there she is .
aah !
i must' ve slipped .
wayne , um ... what do you do if every time you see this one incredible woman , you think you' re going to hurl ?
i say hurl .
if you blow chunks and she comes back , she' s yours .
if you spew and she bolts , it was never meant to be .
oh ... i' m not ready yet .
i got to be comfortable with me first .
why don' t you just go talk to her ?

um ... the 23rd .
oh .
oh .
you know ...
cassandra ... from this height , you could really hawk a lugie on someone .
i feel so free up here .
costs a lot to live this free .
this might be a tangent , right , but it' s something i' ve been thinking about ...
hi .
if i had a girl like cassandra ,
i wouldn' t bring her here .
i mean , look at this place .
this is a fully functional babe lair .
chicks are helpless against its powers .
let' s check it out .
i don' t believe i' ve ever had french champagne before .
oh , actually , all champagne is french .
it' s named after the region .
otherwise , it' s sparkling white wine .
americans , of course , don' t recognize the convention , so they call all their sparkling whites champagne , even though by definition they' re not .
ah , yes .
the next generation .
in many ways , it' s superior , but will never be as recognized as the original .
aha .
what' s this ?
how to pick up chicks .
how to meet women .
he' s smooth .
aha .
daily reminder

we' re not mental or anything , so don' t be afraid .
my name is wayne , and this is garth .
ehhh ...
nice to meet you guys .
so do you ... come to milwaukee often ?
well , i' m a regular visitor here , but milwaukee has certainly had its share of visitors .
the french missionaries and explorers were coming here as early as the late 1600s to trade with the native americans .
isn' t milwaukee an indian name ?
yes , pete , it is .
actually , it' s pronounced meeleewahkay , which is algonquin for the good land .
i was not aware of that .
one of the most interesting aspects of milwaukee is the fact that it' s the only major american city to have ever elected three socialist mayors .
does this guy know how to party or what ?
huh ?
huh ?
oh .
o. k. well , we got to get going .
no .

why ?
are you canceling my video ?
no .
in fact , i called to make sure we' re still on .
well , we got a deal , right ?
absolutely .
i' il see you in chicago .
o. k.
bye .
you really pissed me off tonight .
garth , you' ve never been mad at anything in your life .
but you shouldn' t have walked out on the show .
i handled it o. k. , but you shouldn' t walk out on your friend without telling him first .
i have to run everything by you now ?
yeah , you have to run everything by me now .

benjamin set up the video shoot .
i' il be there for three days .
i guess benjamin will be there , too .
he' s producing it .
and what does that mean ?
he' s been paying you a lot of attention lately .
well , maybe he thinks i' ve got some talent .
maybe he' s pokin ' ya .
what ?
you think that' s the way i get a gig ?
first he screws me , then he screws you .
it' s dutch door action .
could you be any more insulting ?
yeah .
i think you better leave .
fine .
i' m out of here .
oh , man .
what the hell' s going on ?
i lost my show , i lost my best friend ,
i lost my girl .
i' m being shit on , that' s all shit on .

i' m sorry .
i didn' t mean to dump on you .
i' il figure something out .
o. k. ?
hey , mr. doughnuthead man , who' s trying to kill you ?
i don' t know , but they better not .
if you stab a man in the dead of winter , steam will rise up from the wounds .
that' s not good !
i' m not happy !
oh , no !
indians believed it was his soul escaping from his body .
right , glen .
reee !
reee !
reee !
reee !
reee !
reee !
reee !
reee !
reee !
reee !
reee !
reee !
reee !
reee !
hi .
hi .
i' m sorry about what i did ...
buds ?
buds .
officer kuharski .
damn shame how they screwed up your show .
it was a nice little program .
not that i ever watched it .
here you go .
so , uh , how you doing ?
' k. , s' pose .
just wish i had cassandra back .
she' s in chicago shooting a video with " bun ja mun .
so , uh ... [ slurping ]
what are you going to do ?
i don' t know .
i do have one plan .
what are you going to do with these guys ?
oh , nothing , really .
i just always wanted to open a door to a room where people are being trained
like in james bond movies .
wicked .
i think you should just go get cassandra .
i just don' t think she wants me to .
let me tell you a little something
i' ve learned about women .
they want you to come get them .
they love it .
i just wish there was something i could offer her that benjamin couldn' t .
you' il think of something .
wait a minute .
no .
wait a minute .
hmm .
wait a minute !
i know
the guy in the limo , mr. big , the owner of sharp records .
if we could just get him to listen to cassandra play .
halt .
halt .
the security guard at the concert said
mr. sharp was driving back through chicago on friday .
that' s right .
wow .
aren' t we lucky we were there to get all that information ?
it seemed extraneous at the time .
o. k. , first i' il access the secret military spy satellite that' s in a geosynchronous orbit over the midwest .
then i' il i. d. the limo by the vanity plate " mr. biggg " and get its position .
then i' il reposition the transmitter dish in the remote truck to 17 . 32 degrees east , hit westar 4 over the atlantic , bounce the signal down into the azores , up to comsat 6 , beam it back to satcom 3 transponder 137 , and down to the dish on mr. big' s limo .
it' s almost too easy .
we can only pray he' s watching television in his limo at that exact moment .
we' il need help .
we' il help .
we' il help .
you get cassandra !
we' il do the rest !
to the mirthmobile !
yeah !
whoo !
whoo !
o. k. , this is a take , everybody .
i think the snake fell asleep !
uh ...
playback !
looking good .
ain' t got no reason for reaction
no
ain' t got no reason for distraction
i love the way that you love me , baby
love the way that you stare
ooh , the way that you tease me , baby
ooh , touch me
yeah
touch me
this snake weighs a ton .
it looks great on you .
i' m coming down now .
i' m telling you , you' re hot .
yes , officer ?
is there something wrong ?
have you seen this boy ?
aah !
aah !
you know , you' re exactly right .
why leave the hotel ?
we' il have dinner sent up , you can have a hot bath , and i' il make some calls .
cassandra !
we have to talk .
i don' t want to talk to you .
i don' t want to talk to you .
i' ve set up an audition for your band .
my show' s coming back .
you' ve got to be on it .
go home .
i' m not going anywhere .
cassandra , i love you .
you may not believe it , but i love you .
am i supposed to just turn my back and leave ?
am i supposed to be a man ?
am i supposed to say ,
that' s o. k. i don' t mind .
i don' t mind .
well , i mind !
i mind big time !
and you know what the worst part of all is ?
i never learned to read .
is that true ?
yes .
everything except the reading part .
very nice speech , wayne .
we' re very busy .
of course .
her music video .
very clever .
but where is her band ?
hi , wayne .
hi , wayne .
oh , hi , guys .
i didn' t see you there .
well , i guess you' ve thought of everything , huh ?
nothing left for me to do but just go home .
bye bye , wayne .
it' s bedtime .
but both you and i know that there is no film in this camera .
jimmy !
wayne ... go home .
sometimes people outgrow one another .
it' s very sad , but you can' t let it drag you down .
is that you ... or the snake ?
campbell , wait up !
cassandra , i know i don' t have his looks ,
i know i don' t have his money ,
i know i don' t have his connections , his knowledge of fine wines ,
i know sometimes when i eat
i get this clicking sound in my jaw
shut your yap and get in the car .
excellent .
that' s right , girl .
mr. big' s limousine is right where we want it .
impossible plays ]
gentlemen , this is it .
let' s go .

wait up , guys .
i fell on my keys .
ow !

oh , hi , russell .

hold it right there .
hey !
hey !

give me the flashlight , russell .
you can help us , russell .
no !
i' m supposed to stop you .
w w what are you going to do , be benjamin' s monkey boy the rest of your life ?
benjamin' s my friend .
no .
benjamin is no one' s friend .
if benjamin were an ice cream flavor , he' d be pralines and dick .
it' s o. k.
he' s going to be ...
o. k.

i love you , man .

i love you , cassandra .
i love you , garth .
i love you , dreamwoman .
you know , ever since i did your show , kids are looking at me in a whole new way .
i love you , man .
and i love you , because i' ve learned that platonic love can exist between two grown men .
and i' ve learned something , too .
i' ve learned that a flawless profile , a perfect body , the right clothes , and a great car can get you far in america almost to the top but it can' t get you everything .
isn' t it great that we' re all better people ?
