wow , look at that .
i hear they' re very big out your way .
yeah ?
yeah , i guess they are .
i' m driving , so ...
attaboy .

so , it looks like emperor' s new clothes will top $100 mill in domestic bo .
yeah .
and quantum studios , i think they' re looking to vertically integrate , either by buying a web or a weblet .
could be .
yes .
yeah .
hey .
hi .
i see you' ve met dad .
yeah .
we' ve been talking shop .
so what do you want to do tonight ?
do you guys have a movie theater ?
the warner .
it' s part of the loews family of theaters .
have you seen king arthur of britain ? " ve been wanting to .
you two enjoy yourselves .
have her back by dawn .
and no cocaine .
no , sir .
how was l ?
you were great , daddy .
good night .
bye bye .
im telling you , that' s him .
oh , yeah .
mom , i swear it' s him .
you think so ?
yes , it' s tad hamilton .
you look so sad there .
give me a break .
i' d just lost my wife and my goat .
next week , on a very special paramedic rescue ...
and what were your respective ages ?
i was 12 and she was 30 .
did your mother know ?
yeah .
hasta el proximo miercoles .
ahora disponsible en viernes in super mercado .
so , what do people do at this point in the evening in fraziers bottom ?
well , they go to the diner .
we could do that .
we haven' t eaten anything in almost , what , 15 minutes .
or they go home .
it is a school night .
of course , if it were a date , we might go to the watergap overlook .
and what do people do there ?
they park .
and then ?
and then they marvel at what a feat of engineering the gap is .
but this isn' t a date .
we can' t do that .
no .
no .
i don' t want to do anything to harm the friendship .
me neither .
over two trillion tons of water pass through the gap every hour .
that' s enough water to float a battleship .
or put out every fire in west virginia .
no kidding .
uh oh .
excuse me .
huh .
hello .
hi , mr. futch .
it' s pete .
hiya , pete .
rosie' s not here .
she' s out with tad hamilton .
really ?
i hadn' t ...
ok , cool .
good for her , then .
he seems like a very nice guy .
he does .
a lovely , lovely guy .
so , like , where did they go ?
the movies .
the movies .
ok .
it looks like the seven o' clock would get out at 8 . 45 , 8 . 50 ... or so someone happened to just mention to me in passing .
so i guess that would put them out and about and onto their next activity .
i guess it would , pete .
i' il leave rosie a note that you called .
yeah , i just had a little inventory question .
a little dairy case query .
but we can clear that up tomorrow .
ok , pete .
goodbye .
all right .
rosie ...
could i see your driver' s license and regis ...
yikes a bee .
hello , officer .
rosalee ?
hi , tom .
hi .
wow .
oh , boy .
ok , then .
we heard you were in town , mr. hamilton .
did you ?
pretty fond of our rosalee there , huh ?
yes .
yes , i am , officer .
tom ?
right , right , listen .
we got a call saying that there was someone parked here and you know it' s illegal after sunset , so ...
you got a call at this hour ?
yeah .
from who , a raccoon ?
never mind .
i am going to kill pete , bring him back to life and then kill him again .
calm down .
calm down .
why aren' t you upset ?
because it doesn' t matter .
ok ?
what happened here tonight was a force of nature .
two people set out to be friends , but nature would have none of it .
nature wanted them to be more .
and nature is going to want that tomorrow .
what did i tell you ?
what did i tell you about your carnal treasure ?
you said to guard it .
i said , guard it .
and what did you do ?
you practically chucked it at him .
you' re acting like it was a sleazy night .
it wasn' t .
it was classy .
it' s not like he took you to the movies and then felt you up in his car .
the evening evolved , pete .
my god , did he actually say that ?
it started as two friends going to the movies ...
and it evolved into dry humping .
he fought it .
he didn' t want to do anything that might wreck the friendship .
wow .
did he actually ...
i can' t believe he used that line .
and i can' t believe you bought it .
it' s not a line .
ok , fellas , a show of hands .
who here has used some form of the " don' t want to harm the friendship " line ?
father newell ?
well , prior to my enfrockment .
rosie , what are tad' s pectorals like to the touch ?
are they warm yet firm like ...
cath , that' s really not helping now .
sorry , got caught up .
thanks .
listen , rosie , just ...
listen to me , bottom line .
tad hamilton is an actor , ok ?
how do you know that he' s not acting with you ?
he' s not acting .
no .
he is .
he' s playing a role .
the role of hollywood bad boy trying to find virtue .
ok , after you guys have ...
after you guys have been together a couple of times he' s out of here , ok ?
you will never see him again .
hey , rosie , guess what ?
i bought a house .
i bought a house .
can you believe it ?
can you believe it ?
it' s actually a farm with a house and a silo for my wheat .
really ?
you bought a house .
i bought a house .
we' re putting down roots , baby .
what do you think of that ?
it' s good .
come see it .
maybe after work ?
i' d love to .
yeah , i' d love to .
great .
he' s going to stay in the motel while he fixes up the farm .
he' s a farmer all of a sudden ?
i think he' il be a good farmer .
he' s from malibu , california .
the only thing they grow there are breasts .
could you smile a little bit ?
this means nothing .
you are unbelievable .
what ?
rosie , people like this buy houses all the time .
it' s called a tax shelter .
peter .
i can guarantee you that by the end of today
tad' s farm and his house and his fricking wheat will be right back on the market .
why ?
what are you going to do ?
nothing .
you know , just be a good neighbor .
howdy .
tad , this place is unbelievable .
thanks , little lady .
this barn sits on what they call " the south 40 .
yeah .
im not sure exactly how many acres that is , but
i' m going to guess that' s a lot .
i' m going to guess 40 .
oh , yeah .
could be .
tad , being a new farm owner and all ,
i know you' il probably get some people to run this place for you , but ... hell , i' d be happy to show you a couple of everyday farm chores .
really ?
pete , that would be great .
thank you .
tad , that' s not a problem .
what you' re going to do here is grab on to one of the ... essentially one of the nipples , and just pull it firmly but gently towards the pail .
you' re going to freak out a ...
mmm , look at all that creamy milk .
that a girl , arleen .
that a girl .
you are making old tad thirsty .
where' d you learn to do that ?
pete , you remember my remake of the grapes of wrath ?
ok , so , the trick is to take a full swing so as to split the log in one swift ... stroke .
ok .
yeah .
let' s do this .
so , you work out ?
no .
yeah , me neither .
i know , it' s like ...
me neither .
ok .
it' s just basically one swift stroke .
ok .
and sometimes , basically , you get a bad piece of wood .
basically .
and sometimes you don' t .
that' s good .
beginner' s luck .
first time' s the charm .
and the luck continues .
that' s great for you , man .
did you ever see a movie i did called a man named jackson ?
if it came out , tad , then i saw it .
i think the ax is actually broken .
you got it .
good .
get someone else to cry , because i don' t cry .
i don' t do that .
which is why i try to stay away from melodramas .
oh , my god .
i finally did it .
people , are you watching this ?
rosie .
pete .
hey , tad .
hey .
can i talk to you for a sec ?
yeah , sure .
forgive the intrusion , but ...
no , no .
please , fire away .
ok .
here it is .
you win , ok ?
fair and square .
you win .
thank you .
you did have an advantage or two going in , but ...
excuse me , we' re in the middle of something here .
yeah , no problem .
i want rosie to be happy .
so , i got to ask you a couple of questions .
do you know how long she keeps her hair in straight or in curly mode ?
what ?
or why her favorite necklace has a starfish clasp ?
no .
do you even know that she has six different smiles ?
she has six smiles ?
yeah .
one when something flat out makes her laugh .
one when she' s laughing out of politeness .
but there' s one when she makes plans .
one when she makes fun of herself .
one when she' s uncomfortable .
and one when ...
one when she' s talking about her friends .
i don' t know those things yet , pete .
no , you don' t , tad .
i' m telling you , she is more of ... a treasure than you can possibly know .
she' s not just some wholesome small town girl , some good for you breath of fresh air .
tad , she is a wonderful person with a huge heart .
yeah .
and the kind of beauty that a guy only sees once , you know ?
once .
listen , tad , if there is even a chance that you could break her heart , please , just , for her sake ... walk away , man .
i could never break rosalee' s heart .
ok ?
good .
because if you do , i swear to god ,
i will tear you to pieces with my bare hands .
or vicious rhetoric .
you' re a good guy , pete .
but it' s apparently not good enough .
do you mind if i ...
yeah , no .
my bad .
finish up in here .
im sorry .
you' re a good kisser .
but i guess it doesn' t come as a shock to you to hear that .
you' re a really good kisser .
even compared to hollywood girls ?
mm hmm .
that' s just ridiculous .
oh , tad hamilton .
your favorite people are here .
you got to be kidding me .
who is it ?
guess who ?
it' s my agent and my manager .
taddy ?
tadala .
this is a nightmare .
housekeeping .
let us in .
hey , tad .
i' d like to apologize for ...
open zee zleibenshlocken .
come on .
you' re not going to be punk' d .
fellas .
tad edward hamilton .
howdy , little lady .
hi .
my manager , richard levy and my agent , richard levy .
you' re both named richard levy ?
who isn' t ?
you .
you must be rosalee .
yes .
did we come at a bad time ?
i hope so .
actually , yes .
well , tad .
jimmy lng stopped breathing .
what ?
you got the part , pal .
seems he saw something that reminded him that he had to have you .
it was the body of your work .
i knew it .
your credits .
the reality of you and who you are .
he called me and said , " who am i kidding ?
tad hamilton has to play this part .
there' s nobody else .
fellas , i have never felt better than i do at this moment .
except for that weekend in cabo .
that is exactly what i am talking about .
easy , " ve got a bad back .
that' s exactly what im talking about .
i told you a little good career news would put your head back on straight .
so then you' re leaving ?
yes .
fittings monday and rehearsals tuesday .
you' re back on the beam , pally .
boy , things happen fast .
oh , my god .
you' re right .
no , it' s fine .
im going to turn it down .
what ?
what ?
you are ?
i came here vowing to change my priorities and at the first opportunity im abandoning that .
you' re not going to turn down the part .
we both know that .
give us a minute , will you , fellas ?
we' il be in the lobby .
i wonder if they have a masseuse on staff .
i want you to go with me .
what ?
what ?
she absolutely cannot go with him .
i won' t take the part unless you come me .
although we could work something out .
really ?
yes , really .
rosie , have you been listening to anything " ve been telling you ?
i love you .
how many times in your life have you said that ?
not counting the movies ?
not counting .
i' ve said it a few times .
but ...
but i never knew what it meant .
i can' t go with you , tad .
because you don' t love me .
you maybe want to love me , but i think what you love right now is the idea of me .
you can' t love someone for what they stand for or seem to be .
you have to love them for their details , for the things that are true of them and only them .
i do love you for your details , rosie .
you don' t .
you couldn' t possibly .
you don' t even know what they are .
you have six smiles .
what ?
you have six smiles .
did you know that ?
one when something really makes you laugh .
and one when you' re just laughing out of politeness .
one when you' re making plans and one when you' re making fun of yourself .
one when you' re uncomfortable and one when ...
one when you' re talking about your friends .
how many is that ?
like 50 .
i told you .
i told you .
that is so much better than any speech from any of your movies .
i had a better writer .
so ...
will you go ?
yes .
he' s going back to cali , to cali , to cali .
what are you thinking ?
nothing .
im done thinking .
if im making a huge mistake , i don' t want to know .
you' re not making a mistake .
you know , as a bartender you do learn to kind of recognize those customers who need to talk .
angelica , im fine .
but could i have , like , six more of these ?
no , pete .
you really need to talk .
ok .
i think that our friend rosie ... might be falling in love with tad hamilton .
yeah , didn' t have to be a bartender to see that one coming .
right , but the problem with that is ... that im in love with rosie .
you know , i always thought that maybe you were .
so how much do you love her ?
is it love , is it big love or is it great love ?
what do you mean ?
love you get over in two months .
big love , two years .
and great love ...
yeah ?
great love changes your life .
oh , my god .
it' s great love .
lsn' t that great ?
you got to win her back .
angelica , trust me , i have tried everything .
what did she say when you told her that you love her ?
well , actually , maybe not everything , but ...
what did she say when you kissed her ?
ok , maybe it' s more like two things i haven' t tried .
well , what have you tried ?
i have very unsubtly implied how i feel about her .
ok , get up .
what ?
get your ass off the barstool .
angelica .
hey , if you feel it and you don' t do everything in your power to reach for it you are basically slapping life in the face .
i hate to break it to you , but i don' t stand a chance here , ok ?
honey , your odds go up when you file an application .
sure , but im up against ...
tad hamilton .
you are tad hamilton .
what ?
don' t you see ?
everybody' s tad hamilton to somebody , pete .
rosalee' s tad hamilton to you .
and you' re tad hamilton to me .
angelica , thank you .
so start acting like it .
ok .
yeah , ok .
you are a really good bartender .
hi .
hey .
come in , come in .
i have something to talk to you about .
me , too .
really ?
you go first .
no , you go first .
no .
seriously , you go first .
ok .
tad got a part in this huge movie and he asked me to go with him to california for the shoot .
we leave tomorrow afternoon .
lsn' t that great ?
i probably should' ve gone first .
why ?
what were you going to say ?
it' s nothing .
it was nothing .
just , you know , travel safely , ok ?
and just really enjoy the shoot .
actually , no , i remember what i was going to say .
i love you , rosie .
i always have .
if " ve been a jerk this last week , it' s because i have been fighting .
i have been fighting for you .
i don' t want to lose you to tad hamilton or anyone else .
you' re the one .
so , any reaction to any of this ?
because now would be an excellent time .
now ?
you kiss me now ?
you say this to me now , after 22 years of being my friend ?
yes , to all questions .
i' m ...
i have to pack .
you' re telling me that you can' t answer the most important question i' il ever ask in my entire life because you have to pack ?
not only do i have to pack , but i have a load of whites in the dryer , and my dad called my relatives from san clemente and they' re expecting me , so .. it' s all in the works .
but this is ...
rosie , what' s in your heart ?
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry , too .
you ok , pete ?
yes , sir .
listen , pete , obviously we' ve all been a little seduced by tad hamilton' s presence .
no one more so than me .
but that doesn' t mean i don' t know who cares about my daughter the most and who she would be with if the world were fair .
well , it' s not .
no .
no , it' s not .
when i was your age i was completely in love with eleanor hershey .
of the chocolate hersheys ?
the hershey chocolates ?
she was a great girl , completely unpretentious .
i actually met her filling her cadillac up with gas .
anyway , there was this french guy .
he was really rich .
he owned , like , france .
i didn' t stand a chance .
it happens that way sometimes .
it shouldn' t , but it does .
sometimes goliath kicks the shit out of david .
it' s just nobody bothers to tell that story .
well , thanks , mr. futch .
i feel much better now .
goodbye , mr. futch .
take it easy , pete .
are you sure you know what you' re doing ?
no .
ever feel more confused or alone ?
no .
have a nice flight .
so , we' il see you after principal photography .
yes , daddy .
you guys don' t mind not flying with us ?
we need our privacy .
that' s fine .
yeah .
we look forward to our shit ass commercial flight .
i always wanted a layover in cincinnati .
we will be absolutely fine .
another one in chicago .
so we' il be in la by april ?
we' il be fine .
it' s time .
ok .
safe trip , tad .
bye , honey .
welcome aboard , mr. hamilton .
bye .
miss ?
thank you .
stop it .
stop it .
what' s the matter with you ?
come on .
commercial isn' t so bad .
there' s got to be room for one more .
will you pull yourself together ?
thank you .
would you like a vicodin ?
jimmy , being in your movie is a privilege .
in fact , it' s more than a privilege .
it' s a real privilege .
can i ...
do you mind if i call you back in a few minutes ?
ok , thank you , sir .
you ok ?
mm hmm .
i' m just a little nervous for some reason .
i have a little nervous feeling in my ... self .
but that' s only natural , right ?
yeah .
this is a pretty huge thing im doing .
kind of a great leap of faith .
but i have that faith in you .
so im fine .
it' s going to be great .
good .
can' t you tell by my smile ?
which one is it ?
what ?
what number smile is it ?
it' s ...
wait , it was one .
no , one was when something really made me laugh .
right ?
one and a half .
rosie ...
i didn' t know about your six smiles .
pete told me about them .
he made me swear i wasn' t going to break your heart , or he would tear me to pieces , either with his bare hands or his rhetoric .
i stole the speech from pete to get you to come here with me .
i lied .
and im sorry .
and i know you' re going to be very upset .
i just ...
pete told you about the six smiles ?
yeah .
and made you swear that you wouldn' t break my heart ?
or he' d tear you to pieces , with either his bare hands or his rhetoric ?
yeah .
that is just so ...
adorable .
what ?
do you think it' s possible to love someone your whole life and never really realize it until something happens that makes you see ?
what' s that from ?
no , it' s not from anything .
i' m just saying it to you .
wow .
man , what a week .
fell in love for the first time , got my heart broken for the first time , was honorable for the first time .
got bit in the ass for being honorable for the first time .
bought a farm .
i' m sorry about the broken heart part .
do you think you could take me home now ?
yeah .
thank you .
cathy .
rosie ?
where' s pete ?
he' s not here .
what are you doing ?
what do you mean ?
he' s always here .
he' s pete .
no .
he didn' t come in today .
can i borrow your car ?
yes .
thank you .
pete .
pete .
not pete .
wow .
i' m just here because pete asked me to box up some stuff .
why ?
where' s he going ?
richmond .
and he isn' t going .
he' s gone .
he' s gone to richmond ?
why ?
i cannot believe i am taking my work home with me .
when great love is rejected , rosalee , something inside a man dies .
so all he can do is run away , where he can meet the girl he' il love second most .
unless ...
unless what ?
unless you can get to him before he closes the book on you .
but once it' s closed , it' s closed .
it' s finished .
it' s gone , dead .
it' s crushed .
it' s beaten .
it' s buried .
it is lost for all of time in a sea ...
angelica .
ok , yeah .
i owe you .
go .
if you' ve been dumped , give us a call on late night talk .
let' s go to line one .
scott , you' re on ...
what ?
pass me .
pete .
pete .
are you ok ?
yeah .
no ...
no , i meant to do that .
you have five smiles , pete .
one when you think someone' s an idiot .
one when you think someone' s really an idiot .
one when you' re getting all dressed up .
one when you' re singing barry white .
and one ... when you' re looking at me .
for all you lovers out there , this one' s for you .
i can' t believe im going to say this , but ...
would you like to dance ?
