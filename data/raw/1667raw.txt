hello , everyone .
we want to welcome a very special guest to our park today the president' s daughter .
big smile .
big smile .
hello , alexandra .
where' s your father ?
he' il be here .
i' il make sure of it .
well , hey there , little miss first lady ,
i' m dinky winks , owner of this fine establishment .
you ready to ride the ride and shrill to the thrills , spills , and chills ?
yes , i am .
right this way !
of course , that behind me the world famous whippersnapper .
guaranteed to make grown men howl
like a cub woke at weaning time .
over on our left ...
whoa !
whoa !
whoa !
the nervewracker oh ho , painful .
good fun .
on your other left is , uh , well , my personal favorite the vomiter .
now , we tell people not to ride it on a full stomach , but you know folks .
they just don' t listen .
but ... why bother with any of those ?
you' re here for my latest and greatest .
for your personal amusement and complete gratification ,
i humbly offer ... the juggler .
but is it fast ?
ls it fast ?
well , let' s see , shall we ?
the riders are strapped into the bubble .
the hydrobot lifts the bubble high into the air .
and spins it round and round as fast as the united states government will allow .
whoa !
whoa !
the bubble spins , turns , flips , and bounces .
aah !
aah !
aah !
and then ... it juggles you .
whoa !
whoa !
whoa !
whoa !
i want to go on !
i thought so .
now , understand the override precautions are top notch , modified by yours truly .
i thought her father was supposed to be here .
the president has more pressing business than to spend an entire sunday in a theme park .
no one' s that busy .
have fun , kid .
we' il take it a little slow , just make it fun .
mm hmm .
can' t you get her down ?
somebody' s jammed the override .
why , that little troublemaker .
remain calm .
remain calm .
we are the secret service .
everything is under control .
there' s nothing we can do , sir .
what ?
the weight of our agents will prevent us from ascending the shaky precipice on which she now stands .
she' il fall .
don' t we have any smaller agents ?
bring me agents sk1 and sk2 .
coming through .
coming through .
we' re ready .
use this the latest gear .
we get to keep them afterwards ?  n no .
yes .
of course .
let' s rock .
you' re sure they can handle this ?
lf not , there are two others who can .
bring me agents sk3 and sk4 as backup .
ugh .
ugh .
we got company .
gary and gerti what are they doing here ?
ugh .
ugh .
ugh !
excuse me there , sport .
where did you get that ?
latest in electro riser technology , with new composite materials and a. l . brainology .
i can see you don' t know what i' m talking about .
gary , this is my rescue .
we' il take it from here .
latest gear , " my butt .
no , no , no !
you' il just make it worse !
now you done it .
over here !
get away from me !
alexandra , take my hand !
back off !
i want my father to come up here and get me .
but he' s the president of the united states .
no , he' s my father .
he was my father before he ever became president , and he should still be my father now .
i want him up here !
sir , we have a situation .
she' s got the transmooker .
this is now a code red situation .
get her down now !
the point is , you and your father need to have a talk .
up here may not be the best place .
come with me , and i promise you ,
the two of you will have that talk .
how can you promise that ?
i' m level 2 .
i can order him to talk to you .
hi , gerti .
whatcha doing ?
i' m trying to stop the ride .
without disengaging the axis ?
exactly .
then stop what you' re doing .
you see , the ride is designed to work like a giant magnet .
lf you reverse the polarization , bye bye , president' s daughter .
see you around .
okay .
wait .
i took this from my father' s office this morning .
i' m sure he' il want it back .
careful !
look , cortez , you take her down , and i' il take this down .
that way , we both look good .
i' m not doing this for looks , gary .
thank goodness you' re all right , alexandra .
we were worried sick .
oh , boys .
i think this is what you' re looking for .
she swiped it from the president .
oh , you' re in big trouble this time , missy .
wait a minute .
i promised her she could talk to her father .
oh , she' il talk to him , all right .
we' il make sure of that .
promise me one thing ...
what ? no more winky dinky assignments .
so , you want the ukata assignment , huh ?
your duties are assigned to you by the agency same as everyone , same as me .
i know .
it' s just that we' ve learned so much .
juni and i are more than capable of taking bigger assignments .
but that' s not your decision to make .
the spy kids organization is still new , and if you' re a level 3 or even a level 2 , you cannot go on a mission alone .
you need more experience .
come on .
okay , mom , if you' re looking for top secret information , just go straight to the source .
welcome to the pentagon .
how did you do that ?
you can' t do that .
there is no hacking in this household .
i know .
sorry .
show me that again .
i know this hair thing is one of my weakest points .
wait one minute .
you' re gonna look cool .
ln fact , you' re looking cooler , right ?
like me .
like poppy .
and it' s kind of em o tion al to me .
you know ?
uh oh .
a knot .
we are gonna ...
you ...
uh huh , uh huh .
we got it .
that' s my boy .
last touch .
hup , hup .
you want me to tie it for you ?
no , it' s okay .
r. a. l. p. h. can do it .
bow tie , r. a. l. p. h. , and not too tight .
thanks , r. a. l. p. h.
lnteresting .
but ... he can never , ever replace ... me .
pow .
not yet , but i think that new upgrade comes in next week .
uh huh .
oh .
only joking .
hey !
kids .
kids .
kids .
kids .
ki
joking ?
thank you .
yes , ma' am .
okay .
remember , kids , this is a very important night for your father .
and if he' s named director of the o. s. s. , be sure to stand up and give him a big hug , all right ?
what if dad doesn' t win ?
well , then , give him a bigger hug .
oh , yao ling , wa ling , this is danielle and dione daluc .
hello .
hi .
they created lnfolink , sort of an online trading system for swapping international secrets .
hi .
oh , hey .
hello .
champagne ?
can' t have any of that .
sorry .
something doesn' t feel right .
no wonder your buddy' s here your buddy with the weird laugh .
he does not have a weird laugh .
we were just ... talking about you .
really ?
wow .
you look great , carmen .
you want to dance ?
sure .
i don' t think that' s a good idea , gary .
family rules say you need to ask my father' s permission .
you know , you should have had that suit tailored , juni .
it' s bunching up around your gut , and it makes your head look way too big .
you have to excuse my little brother .
he' s still a little upset about the ... juggler incident .
a good agent controls his temper .
just be glad my dad isn' t here .
he gets really psycho about this sort of thing .
hi , dad .
um , you remember gary .
he' s in our organization .
i was just asking your daughter for a dance .
you know how to dance ?
fairly well , sir .
what kind of dances ?
all types of dances .
what about tango ?
yes .
mambo ?
fairly well .
rumba ?
yes .
cha cha cha ?
seven steps .
bossa nova ?
mm hmm .
merengue ?
of course .
what about waltz ?
y yeah , i can waltz .
show me .
right .
something like that .
all right .
you can go to dance .
watch your older sister .
alexandra ?
yes ?
what are you doing in there ?
dancing .
do you always carry this many secret service around ?
my dad' s idea he' s gotten a little ... paranoid .
well , would you dance ... with me ?
no .
all right , hold on a second , guys .
level 2 break it up !
why not ?
i only dance ... ballet .
what an incredible coincidence .
so do l .
well , juni , i must say , you' re a man of many talents .
one tries .
uh , could you find your seats ?
we' re ready to start .
i must go .
ladies and gentlemen , the president of the united states .
thank you .
i am proud of the o. s. s. and their newly formed spy kids division .
for their outstanding accomplishments yesterday .
gary and gerti giggles not only saved my daughter ...
what is he talking about ? !
i saved her !
juni ...
but more importantly , if not most importantly , they safely retrieved the transmooker device that my daughter accidentally took from my office earlier that day .
now it is my great pleasure to announce the new director of the o. s. s ....
gregor
... donnagon giggles .
gary and gerti giggles are the kind of agents we need to turn the o. s. s. around .
i am proud to award them
these level 1 badges ,
what ? which will enable them to take on real missions , something challenging , like the ukata assignment .
yes !
i wanted that assignment .
this is so unfair .
i am proud to claim them as our organization' s top spy kid operatives !
something' s not right .
and i' m also proud to claim them , of course , as my children .
this is all wrong .
to our spy kids .
to our spy kids .
to our spy kids .
to our spy kids .
to our spy kids .
whoa .

the following spy kid cadets please report to the psychic abilities seminar
mike cardenas and daniel duluth .
it' s my turn , too .
are you sure ?
all right , your last name is ?
hold on a second .
i had the transmooker in my hand , but you know juni he wanted to claim it for himself .
okay , that should do it .
thank you , son .
right .
lf that transmooker device falls into the wrong hands ... we' re doomed .
thank you , mr. president .
that' il be all .
we' re doomed !
understood , sir .
here .
floop' s fooglie " ...
starring minion ... and carmenita ...
thanks .
i was fired .
i know .
i hacked into the o. s. s. data files and saw the news .
it was probably my fault , i suppose .
i' m sorry .
well , i guess that' s that .
let' s go to the tree house .
i got an idea .
i guess i could always set up a small detective agency out here or something .
you' re thinking small again , juni .
the old tree house needs another helicopter pad .
it needs a paint job , is what it needs .
your name ?
carmen elizabeth juanita echo sky brava cortez .
your name ?
juni rocket racer rebelde cortez .
you know ...
i' m kind of looking forward to retirement , get back to all the projects and dreams i left behind .
oh , stop it , juni .
look , do you want your job back or not ?
that' s right reinstated level 2 .
so now we can get back the missing transmooker .
how ?
looks like gary and gerti are about to get briefed on the ukata assignment .
we should listen in .
ls r. a. l. p. h. still at your office ?
lf they haven' t cleaned it out yet .
r. a. l. p. h. , get to the briefing room .
we need you to spy on gary and gerti .
make sure no one sees you .
there is a bermuda triangle of sorts off the coast of madagascar .
as you may remember , this is an area where some of our o. s. s. cargo ships have been disappearing .
good boy , r. a. l. p. h.
the survivors of these disappearances tell delusional tales of a mysterious island populated by strange creatures .
obviously , no land mass is located anywhere near there ,
so these tales were dismissed , and the agents fired .
however ... the magnet ship that captured the transmooker device was last seen in this same area .
so , we need a small ship , piloted by two small agents to go in and take a closer look .
lf you find anything out of the ordinary , you return , you report it back here .
we accept .
we accept .
you bet we accept .
come home , r. a. l. p. h. good work .
it' s a great assignment , but gary and gerti have it , and i' m fired .
and i' m reassigning you to the o. s. s.
don' t tell me you' re hacking into  already done .
level 2 status reinstated .
carmen , you can' t do this .
i already did it .
i' d take it one step further .
we' re assigning ourselves to the ukata assignment .
i' m programming a new destination for gary and gerti .
now , that , i got to be a part of .
state your name , please .
gary giggles .
access denied .
it knows you' re not him .
confirmed .
new destination ?
how about ...
gobi desert ?
stop it , juni .
what ?
don' t want your boyfriend to go so far away ?
he' s not my boyfriend .
okay , then .
destination confirmed .
there .
what did we just do again ?
we' re gonna get the transmooker device back so we can clear your name .
we just have to solve the case before anybody finds out what we' re up to .
are you with me ?
okay .
then let' s go .
hello ?
hello ?
hey , what are you doing up there ? !
sorry , we thought you were somebody else .
who gave you a key ?
did you forget who built you this place ?
come down from there .
i brought you all new gadgets .
check it out the very latest spy watch total communication center , right there on your wrist .
cellphone , lnternet access , satellite tv you name it .
that baby will do everything but tell you what time it is .
it doesn' t tell time ?
no , there was so much stuffed into it , there was no more room for the clock .
cool .
are you sure these are new ?
we can' t be running around with outdated equipment .
close your eyes and hold out your wrist .
i' m gonna give you the one gadget you should always carry .
a rubber band ?
no , it' s a machete elastic wonder .
it' s a rubber band .
yeah , but it' s also the world' s greatest gadget 999 uses ... and the important thing is you have to figure out what those uses are ... with this .
he' s right .
use number one a stylish bracelet .
use number two ...
ahh !
i' m gonna make a fortune with these .
are you sure this is going to work ?
just be cool .
as far as anybody knows , you' re back on the force .
hey , uncle felix .
oh .
i' m not your uncle .
i know .
it' s just easier to call you that .
um , you don' t mind , do you ?
of course not .
well , welcome back , juni .
says here you were reinstated .
sure does , doesn' t it ?
he was fired and rehired all in the same day .
okay .
let me bring up the keys to the dragonspy five .
cake .
6 o' clock .
wow .
you' re looking good with the new gear , carmen .
their latest stuff .
very cool ... only we had that weeks ago .
here' s what' s really new .
nanotechnology everything you' re wearing is right here on my wrist .
it' s superaccurate and , oh , so light .
it even tells time .
how did you get that ? !
well , it' s all prototype , juni .
you can' t be running around with those mass produced gadgets .
just means everyone' s got them .
i always go with the prototype .
sure , they' re a little ... buggy ,
but i can deal .
l i accidentally squashed him on my way out of the o. s. s. building .
uh !
sorry about that .
he was outdated , anyway , so think of it as a mercy killing .
gary and gerti giggles ,
you have assignment selkju9 .
good luck .
don' t hurt yourselves with that outdated gear .
remember , an agent is only as good as his gadgets .
what ?
you have the ukata assignment ?
very nice .
you' il love it .
thanks , uncle felix .
i' m not your uncle .
oh , nice sub .
welcome to the dragonspy dlx .
seems like they get more and more sophisticated each month .
everything is automated !
now picking your nose .
ugh .
ugh , little brothers .
let' s check our lunchboxes for mission updates .
sorry , r. a. l. p. h.
you were the best spy on the force .
juni , leave it alone .
he' s dead .
thanks to your buddy gary .
it was an accident .
you like him and believe him ?
i don' t like him ... that much .
gary' s a bad guy , carmen .
maybe i know that .
i think i can change him .
i do not understand you .
and you never will .
french fry , sir ?
uh !
uh !
ow !
gimme that !
strange tales of a mysterious island , disappearing ships , mysterious creatures , and yet , no information anywhere on the o. s. s. cargo or the magnet ship .
what' s donnagon doing there ?
he wasn' t o. s. s. director yet .
these are old o. s. s. secrets .
and i know just the person we can call for advice .
who ?
# who ? #
# what ? #
# when ? #
# where ? #
# who ? # # what ? # # when ? #
# where ? # # and why ? #
# i delight in #
# what ... # # do i intend to find ? # # find #
# this time ? #
# run around ! # # jumping down ! #
# bounce and bound and ... #
# find another way to duck and hide #
# this isle of ... #
# dreams #
hello ?
yes .
one moment , please .
cut !!
who is it again ?
juni cortez !
what can i do for you ?
i mean , you' ve done so much for me .
your robot counterparts are the surprise hit characters of my show !

oh .
he' s right here .
minion is practicing a 4 part harmony .
you have one minute . # hmmm # # hmmm # # hmmm #
# hmmm # # hmmm # # hmmm # # hmmm #
bueno ?
how you doing , minion ?
things are a little floopy around here for my taste , but it' s a living .
i need some information on your favorite subject the o. s. s.
i need to make a call .
okay , you ready ?
ukata ...
transmooker ...
the president' s daughter is unavailable .
manage .
press " 1 " to record .
mean anything to you ?
smells like the work of donnagon giggles .
he had first contact with the transmooker technology .
you think donnagon' s the one behind all this ?
you' re talking to a man with four heads .
trust me the guy is dirt .
what should we look for ?
first , find the island .
then find the lsland man .
that would have been donnagon' s contact .
okay .
thanks , minion .
be a good girl and swat your brother for me .
oh , i will .
something' s wrong !
take the wheel !
got to go .
good luck !
slow down !
we' re nearing destination zone .
the radius where all the disappearances occurred is right ...
here !
we' ve been shut down !
hold onto something !
ugh !
all power is off even the emergency power .
my flashlight doesn' t even work .
we' re stuck , aren' t we ?
let' s get out of here .
rebreathers .
rebreathers .
you got to do it by hand .
what next ?
nope .
hand , carmen .
unbelievable .
low tech !
here we go .
should we travel light or heavy ?
we may not be coming back down here .
let' s go heavy .
lnflate a suits ?
we don' t have much choice .
at least the masks work .
i think it' s because they' re valve operated , not electrical based .
it' s so strange .
good luck .
you too !
stay close !
ugh !
ugh !
ugh .
oh , great .
i' m fat !
was it supposed to do this ? !
it has an electrical automatic shutoff which didn' t work .
luckily , we ran out of air before the suits exploded .
well , we can still laugh .
at what ?
at whatever you can imagine gary and gerti are doing right about now .
ugh .
ugh !
gerti , where are we ? !
well ... according to my coordinates ,
we are ...
i think that
ugh !
ugh !
ohh !
ugh !
camel poop !
someone' s gonna pay !!
cordezes ...
i like your new office .
it' s smaller ... cozy .
especially ... smaller .
oh !
so many successful missions .
amazing , isn' t it ?
remember this one ?
oh .
which mission is that ?
mexico .
of course .
hmm .
actually , that was the one mission we never accomplished .
lngrid ... don' t start with your parents again .
it' s funny you should mention them .
no .
when i mention your parents , it is the exact opposite of funny .
doesn' t it bother you that we never got their full blessing ?
frankly , you deserve another chance to show them  all right , all right .
lnvite them if you want , but i won' t be here .
tell them that i had a i had to go on another mission , that that we' re having a little problem on the moon .
my father loves the moon .
you invited them already , didn' t you ?
mm ... define " invite .
cortezes .
what ? !
i have some bad news .
may i come in ?
uh .
uh .
certainly , sir .
yes , sir .
great .
here he is .
two of our spy kid operatives
are lost on the ukata assignment .
your children had that assignment .
i' m so sorry , donnagon .
how can we help ?
actually , my children are safe somewhere in the gobi desert , i believe .
uh , i' m sorry to say that carmen and juni are somehow the ones on the ukata assignment a computing error of some kind .
communications ?
none .
their dragonspy ship doesn' t show up on radar or satellite .
greg , lngrid , you guys risked your lives once before to save me .
let me go now and personally bring your children back .
no .
thank you .
thank you , donnagon , but , respectfully , we have to do this ourselves .
lf you could provide tactical backup and surveillance support of our efforts , we' il leave immediately .
okay , yeah .
uh , lngrid ...
i know this may be a bad time , but , um ...
your parents are here .
but you guys told me you were coming next tuesday .
this is a very dangerous assignment , and you have to wait here .
well , we want to help .
don' t worry .
you taught me everything i know .
yes ... but not everything we know .
of course not , dad .
see you in a few hours .
thanks , honey .
i still don' t like him .
juni ...
juni ... was that there before ?

i' m way over here !
i felt something against my foot .
there' s something under me !
come look !
uhh .
i don' t see anything , juni .
let' s just concentrate on getting to shore .
okay , it' s about 200 yards .
lf we kick steadily at one foot per kick , we' il reach it in , um ...
25 minutes ?
i don' t know .
my calculator doesn' t work .
whoa !
whoa !
juni , what did you do ? !
the air' s coming out of our suits !
we' re heading towards shore !

ugh .
ugh .
okay , we' re gonna set up a campsite , put up the tent , build a little fire .
and roast marshmallows ?
i can' t believe this !
what happened ?
nothing that' s just it .
that was supposed to make an instant campfire , and that was supposed to make a shelter .
none of our gadgets work .
you mean we have to use our heads ?
yes .
ouch .
big office ...
director of the o. s. s. ' s office .

i don' t get it !
i saw it go through this wall .
what' s your assessment , juni ?
i' d think better with food in my belly .
i think we should go up there and check it out .
up there to the top of the volcano ?
yep .
not even if my micrograpplers were working .
gary would be brave enough to do it .
nope .
nothing you can say can change my mind .

feels like four .
how could you be eating at a time like this ? !
you know that tickling sensation you get when you fall ?
of course .
that pretty much went away after the first hour .
whoa !
waah !
aah !
what happened ? !
i don' t know !
we' re floating !
who are you ?
do you see something ?
over there , hiding .
what do you want ?
i want to get down .
i' m carmen cortez , special agent of the o. s. s.
i' m romero , sole inhabitant of this island of leeke leeke ... ... sole human inhabitant , that is .
and you are ?
tired and hungry .
nice to meet you , tired and hungry .
ahh !
ugh !
ohh !
ohh !
careful !
you' il crush my island !
sorry .
we just fell four hours .
we' re a little clumsy right now .
you weren' t falling .
it was an illusion .
magic ?
science .
quickly , we must get somewhere safe !
i' m a genetic specialist .
i needed a controlled environment for my experiments .
the creatures we' ve been hearing ?
my experiments ... run amok .
what happened ?
i thought i would make a fortune from it .
kids everywhere would have their own miniature zoos ,
right there in their bedrooms .
a miniature zoo ?
god' s creatures ... on a manageable scale .
unbelievable .
i called it " romero' s zoo "
genetically miniaturized animals .
lions , tigers , bears , penguins ...
monkeys .
monkeys in a barrel .
careful .
careful .
one day , i accidentally mixed up two or three different test tubes and created a new species ... altogether .
romero' s zoo too ... an entirely new ... miniature zoo ...
where each species is unlike any creature you' ve ever seen .
horse fly ?
uh huh .
uh ... cat fish .
spider monkey ?
bull frog .
uh ... slizzards .
whoa .
stay away from those .
and so , i started to think ,
" lf only i could make them all a wee bit bigger , "
you know , for kids with meatier hands .
that' s where things went very wrong .
i applied a growth serum , and they took to it all too well .
oh !
oh !
aah !
whoa !
oh !
n n no !
aah !
aah !
no !
and i' ve been locked up in here ever since .
i' m afraid to go out there again .
they' ve tried to gobble me up on more than one occasion .
why do they despise me so ?
i created them .
do you think ...
god stays in heaven because he , too , lives in fear of what he' s created ... here on earth ?
stop looking at me like that .
i' m no loon .
what i' m still trying to figure out is why this island doesn' t show up on even our most advanced satellites .
i created a cloaking device to shield my island from curious eyes .
anything electronically powered that comes within a mile radius instantly shuts down .
any radar that passes over me is displaced , creating the illusion that my island doesn' t exist .
the transmooker device .
how did you know ?
your cloaking device is highly coveted .
people everywhere are trying to get their hands on it .
are you sure we' re the only humans here ?
there they are two children , judging by their size .
what is this ?
it' s a miniature of the island .
the center point of the volcano provides a gravitational basis for which my miniature creatures can line up exactly to their larger clone counterparts .
so , wherever your miniature creatures are on this model , it' s where the bigger ones are outside ?
correct .
i can keep track of their whereabouts this way .
see ?
the two intruder children are being chased by a slizzard .
gary and gerti .
leave ' em .
we have to go help them !
they shouldn' t be snooping around my island to begin with !
i' m with you , dude .
we have to help them .
i' m not going out there !
i' il be eaten !
what a bizarre man .
help us !
help !
help us !
help !
somebody !
what are you guys doing down there ? !
that' s real funny , clown .
get us out !
we tried to activate our micrograpplers , but they didn' t deploy !
nothing works here .
yeah , we know that now .
thanks for the update , carrot top .
juni , come back .
they need our help .
oh , i' il help them .
i want to get him back over here so i can push him back over myself .
hurry up .
come on .
here , gary .
gimme your hand .
thank you , carmen .
here , gerti ... gimme your hand .
just wait till my father gets here .
your father' s coming ?
where are you taking me now , carmen ?
hold on .
why are you still hiding ?
we' re kids , not monsters .
what' s the difference ?
relax .
they' re o. s. s. agents , as well .
level one .
they' re donnagon' s kids .
agent donnagon ?
you work for the o. s. s. , don' t you ?
i work for a man named donnagon .
who is this guy ?
donnagon' s not interested in your creatures .
why not ?
the transmooker device that hides your island that' s what donnagon really wants .
that' s not nearly as interesting .
now that donnagon' s head of the o. s. s. , he has the power to take it from you .
what are you babbling about now , juni ?
the transmooker you took from the president' s daughter , gary .
it was just a prototype .
the real transmooker device is here on this island .
it' s even more powerful and can shut down all technology on the planet .
you said your father' s on his way .
i think he' s coming to pick it up .
you' re all liars .
do you really think you' re gonna turn us on our own father ?
did your dad tell you the mission you went on was just a setup for carmen and me ?
why not ?
he has his reasons .
that' s what being a good spy is all about trust no one .
how to be a spy we' ve read it .
well , read it again .
a good spy makes no binding connections with family or friends .
well , i don' t believe in that do you ?
lf you want to be a good spy , you better believe it .
my father' s a great spy , so let' s grow up , shall we ?
whatever my father' s done , it' s what it takes to play in the big world ...
like it or not .
come on , gerti .
let' s go .
he' s right .
oh !
why can' t you side with me just once ?
there are no sides you' re right , and he' s right , too .
that' s what being a spy means .
well , i don' t like it .
then quit .
i will .
yeah , right .
donnagon was right
their dragonspy doesn' t show up anywhere on radar .
i am not interested in finding the sub .
remember that year
i insisted on doing the children' s dental work ... myself ?
how could i forget ?
well ...
i installed a nonelectrical tracking device in their teeth my own invention .
but i haven' t been able to test it , until ... now .
honey , it works !
whoa ...
hard to believe .
but according to this ...
they' re in the middle of the ocean .
above sea level .
but where they are on the map , there' s no land mass .
how can that be ?
now what ?
something' s got us .
aaah !
what is it ? !
your mother .
mom ?
we wanted to join you .
are you nuts ?
we needed a bigger boat .
and we brought real food none of that freeze dried stuff you think' s so chic .
son in law .
yeah ?
make yourself useful .
why are you here ?
we wanted to help get our grandchildren back !
ah ah !
we will get our grandchildren back .
gracias .
oh , wait .
you' ve got something on your lip .
what ?
ugh !
got it .
uh , mom ...
dad , i am a big girl now , and i can take care of myself , okay ?
and gregorio and i , we can take care of finding our children .
no , you don' t seem to understand .
this isn' t you and gregorio simply saving the world again .
this time , we all have much more to lose if you fail
carmen and juni .
you cannot come with us .
it is too dangerous .
oh , you mean , uh , we can' t handle ourselves , huh ?
may i have my moustache back ... please ?
lf donnagon really is on his way ... ... we have to destroy the transmooker .
where is it ?
the other side of the island .
not easy to get to .
the journey alone is more dangerous than the transmooker itself .
i made sure of it .
show us .
you' re not going out there , are you ?
we don' t have much choice , do we ?
with those monsters running around ?
i don' t believe they' re monsters .
maybe you shouldn' t , either .
well , what should i believe ?
i don' t know .
you' re always in here hiding .
maybe they just wanna be with you .
be with me ?
they wanna be picking me out of their teeth , is what they wanna be .
you just gotta show them who' s boss .
you' re not afraid ?
first thing you gotta do is ... ... fall into this pit .
how does it work ?
supposedly , they' re run magnetically .
we should be able to ride over a determined path .
we have to get the transmooker before they do .
right .
slizzards .
oh , no .
this is cool .
ee !
ee !
ee !
ooh !
uh !
juni !
juni !
i think we should get off now .
why ?
trust me !
aaah !
jump now !
gary and gerti .
i told you they were following us .
uh .
you have one new message .
message one ...
hello , alexandra , it' s me agent juni cortez .
i' m on a mission ...
i know i shouldn' t be .
but i had an idea for you and your father .
simply tell him you need to talk to him .
tell him it' s nothing urgent , but someday it might be urgent .
and you need to open the communication lines right now .
so give me a call .
love to hear from you .
and right now it' s about
silly me , i forgot my watch doesn' t tell time .
heh .
and , uh
something' s wrong .
take the wheel .
gotta go .
good luck !
juni !
end of message .
gregorio , the signal requires that you go around it .
he won' t listen to you .
he won' t listen to you , mother .
choose another directi
he wants to make sure he loses the children again .
lf you would only listen to us and do what we' re saying you' re tracking them all wrong .
lngrid , tell him he' s tracking them all wrong .
mom , dad , i have told you before , and i will tell you again no backseat driving .
thank you .
when gregorio is at the wheel , no one tells him what to do .
turn here , honey .
sorry .
okay .
you' re sure you' re reading that map correctly ?
the coordinates correspond to carmen and juni' s current position .
these are my children .
and i will find them my way !!
blah , blah , blah .
i never understand a single word he' s saying .
never .
not only were we set up , but i bet donnagon knew all along that you' d hack your way into taking this assignment .
i was wondering the same thing .
juni , open up .
what ?
aah .
aah .
dad installed these trackers in case we ever got lost .
ah .
ah ha .
aah .
ah .
ow !
ugh !
ah .
ow .
hurry .
take mine out .
and why are we doing this ?
ah !
ah !
ah !
ugh !
aah .
when we get lost , who saves us ?
mom and dad .
now , if mom and dad also disappear , who' s gonna stop donnagon from using the transmooker device ?
donnagon wants us all together so he can destroy the island and all of us with it .
mom and dad even romero .
we can' t let mom and dad find us ... or donnagon wins .
a big sacrifice .
family is sacrifice .
what happened ?
what did what did you just do ?
we lost carmen .
a and juni ?
juni' s still on line .
i love you .
that can' t be .
okay , okay .
what do we do ?
i don' t know .
maybe this is like the mission of the spies who didn' t want to be found .
you know ... if they don' t want to be found , maybe their position is compromised .
now , gregorio , don' t tell me you didn' t have a backup plan .
lngrid , was juni wearing that charm necklace
i sent him for christmas last year ?
he never takes it off .
then we got him .
i was worried about juni' s well being , so i put a tracer in his necklace .
there he is .
thanks , dad .
are you sure you don' t want me to take over the wheel ?
i that' s funny .
it' s funny .
back to work .
where are we ?
well ... not far from the antechamber .
i think it' s behind us .
don' t move .
maybe it' s friendly .
maybe it' s not .
let' s go !
uh !
uh !
uh !
uh .
it' s an underwater cave .
we' il have to go all the way around .
that' il take all day .
there must be a faster
wow ...
what is this place ?
do you think that' s real gold ?
gross !
this is so slimy .
i hate mold .
i can hear your thoughts .
what ?
and you can hear mine !
our mouths aren' t moving , but we can hear what we' re thinking .
say something .
how strange .
we can only communicate by thought .
magic .
hmm .
think something .
um ... your feet stink .
i wonder .
ohhh !
oh !
oh !
okay , this place is really weird .
let' s go .
good thinking .
now , this is more like it .
treasure .
skeletons .
dead skeletons .
ls there any other kind ?
this must' ve been where the pirate prisoners and treasure were kept .
this must' ve been a pretty special necklace for them to die fighting over it .
one necklace to rule them all
put it back , juni !
i didn' t take it yet .
i can read your mind , remember ?
this land is ancient and cursed .
lf you take anything , you' il doom us both .
let' s go !
come on !
i think i found a way out .
which way ?
i don' t know , you pick right or left ?
right .
wait a minute .
oh , no !
we went in a circle .
what ?
come on .
let' s try it again .
come on , juni !
i know what we did wrong .
we' ve gotta go left .
maybe i should put this back .
uh oh .
where are the dead skeletons ?

oh .

i' m dreaming .
i am totally dreaming .
and i' m hungry , too .

i think that moment' s come .

i' m siding with you .
thanks .
but just this once .
cortezes .
uh !
you gonna help me or not ?
well , there it is .
how do you know ?
' cause it' s big and weird and in the middle of the room .
good point .
careful , juni !
lf you don' t shut it down right , you can bring the entire world to an end .
thanks .
i' m serious .
well , we have to shut it down .
this turns that off .
and that turns this off .
he said there' s something tricky about the third switch .
let' s see .
too late , gary .
we got here first .
just stand up against the wall like a good boy and leave us alone .
nice try , but we brought friends this time .
romero .
what are you doing outside of your cage ?
i have no idea .
donnagon .
hello , agents .
warming it up for me ?
are you ready to cooperate this time , romero ?
i , uh ...
good .
this should be pain ... and simple .
oh !
what did you do ?
he started the transmooker !
you said three switches .
the entire world will shut down instantly .
good going , cheese ball .
what do we do ? !
you must bind together the three toggle switches .
it won' t stay up !
machete elastic wonder !
machete elastic wonder !

i also have romero' s instruction book .
hey .

it' s just over that big hill .
ohh !
ohh !
are you sure this is the right way ?
my watch has a gps satellite , you dope .
wait a minute .
how can this be ?
when you took out the transmooker , the island cloaking device was shut down .
then what are we doing on foot ?
later , romero .
whoa !
aah !
uhh !
there it is !
get up there , dad !
come on !
okay , magna men , we' re gonna need a human ladder starting right ... here .

uh !
the kid was right .
what are you doing ?
trying to remote pilot our submarine to the surface so we can get out of here .
get on your gps and see where mom and dad are .
this can' t be right .
this shows that they' re right next to us .
oh , no !
that' s no way to greet your grandparents .
come on .
grandpa !
ah , juni .

i promise , grandpa .

dad !
hey , mom .

okay , we have the transmooker device , but we need to get off this island right now .
what do you think we' re here for ?
let' s go .
we' il explain it on the way .
you won' t believe who' s behind this .
it couldn' t be any more perfect .
this better not be what i think it is .
it' s all being taken care of , all right ?
get the transmooker device , felix .
felix ?
sorry , gregorio .
a little power goes a long way , doesn' t it ?
reprogram this one , gerti .
i want to start by wiping the cortez family from the face of the earth .
uncle felix , how could you ?
i' m not your uncle .
but we treated you like family .
donnagon said if i joined him he he wouldn' t get rid of me like he' s gonna do to you guys .
you can' t argue with that .
do you still have power in your watch ?
yep .
programming complete , father .
thank you , gerti .
try remote piloting the choppers .
well , cortezes , any last words ?
none that i can say in front of my children .
