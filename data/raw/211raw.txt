heh heh heh heh .
it' s me !
it' s tuco !
let me embrace you !
oh ... ooh .
l ...
i don' t know the right thing .
i was just passing by here .
i said to myself ...
i wonder if my brother remembers his brother ?
did i do wrong ?
it doesn' t matter .
i' m very happy .
you have seen me , tuco .
yeah , well , i' m ...
i' m very glad i came .
uh ...
oh , my uniform !
it' s a long story .
but let' s talk about you .
it' s more important .
you look very well .
hmm , a bit thin perhaps , but ...
ha ha ha ha !
you were always thin , eh , pablito ?
well ...
what about our parents ?
only now do you think of them .
to begin after nine years .
nine years ?
so , it' s nine years .
ha ha ha ha !
nine years !
our mother has been dead a long time now .
our father died only a few days ago .
that' s why i was away .
he asked for you to be there .
but there was only me .
and you ?
outside of evil ... what else have you managed to do ?
it seems to me ... you once had a wife someplace .
not one .
lots of them .
one here .
one there .
wherever i found them .
go on .
preach me a sermon , pablo .
what good would that be ?
just keep on the way you' re going .
go away .
and the lord have mercy on your soul .
sure , i' il go .
and while i' m waiting ... for the lord to remember me ...
i , tuco ramirez ... brother of brother ramirez ... will tell you something .
you think you' re better than i am .
where we came from ... if one did not want to die of poverty ... one became a priest or a bandit .
you chose your way .
i chose mine .
mine was harder !
you talk about mother and father .
you remember , when you left to become a priest ...
i stayed behind .
i must have been 10 , 12 ...
i don' t remember which ... but i stayed .
i tried , but it was no good .
now i will tell you something .
you became a priest ... because you were too much of a coward to do what i do .
ugh !
tuco .
please forgive me , brother .
hyah .
ah , my belly' s full .
nice guy , my brother .
i didn' t tell you ... my brother was in charge here ?
everything .
like the pope almost .
he' s in charge in rome .
yeah , yeah , my brother ... he say to me , " stay , brother .
don' t go home .
we never see each other .
here there' s plenty to eat and drink .
bring your friend , too .
whenever we see each other ... he never lets me go .
it' s always the same story .
my brother ... he is crazy about me .
that' s so .
even a tramp like me ... no matter what happens ...
i know there' s a brother somewhere ... who will never refuse me a bowl of soup .
sure .
well , after a meal ... there' s nothing like a good cigar .
whoa .
look .
whoa .
hey , wake up , you .
the troops are coming .
blue or gray ?
huh ?
they' re gray like us .
let' s say hello to them and then get going .
hoorah !

bill carson !
yeah ... yeah ... that' s me .
please , carson ... answer " present .
hmm .
what are you , deaf ?
ugh !
now suppose you say " present , " carson .
i like big fat men like you .
when they fall , they make more noise .
and sometimes they never get up .
wallace ...
that' s enough .
sergeant !
the captain wants to see you right away .
be sure these two get good treatment .
hey , blondie , did you hear that ?
good treatment .
yeah .
for the last time , sergeant ...
for the last time , sergeant ...
i' m telling you i want the prisoners ... treated as prisoners .
no more brutality .
there' s hundreds of prisoners out there ... and only a few men to guard them .
now what am i supposed to do ?
i have to have respect .
i think that you' il manage to gain their respect ... by treating them better .
are our men treated that well ... in andersonville camp ?
i don' t give a goddamn ... what they do in andersonville .
while i' m in charge here ... the prisoners are not to be tortured ... or cheated ... or murdered .
that an accusation ?
sergeant , gangrene is eating my leg away ... not my eyes .
i know the prisoners here ... are being robbed systematically .
i know there' s scum around ... who are bivouacked near the camp ... waiting for someone to deliver this loot .
but as long as i' m commandant ...
i won' t permit any such trickery .
am i clear ?
yes , sir ... just as long as you' re the commandant .
yes , sergeant .
i know this leg means i won' t last very long ... but i pray i can manage to have enough time ... to amass evidence ... and bring to a court martial ... all those who discredit and dishonor ... the uniform of the union .
i wish you luck .
you and the others ... better lay low for a few days .
no , i' il keep this .
you go .
wallace will let you know .
wallace ... bring me carson .
right .
listen , angel eyes said ... for us to lay low for a few days .
but we' il keep close enough to keep an eye on things .
come on , saddle your horses .
get in .
get in .
huh ?
come on in , tuco .
don' t be bashful .
there' s no formalities here .
it' s been a long time .
you' re hungry .
sit down .
eat .
heh , i knew it , i knew it .
the minute i saw you , i said to myself ...
look at that pig angel eyes .
i' il bet he got himself an easy job .
and he never forgets a friend .
i never forget old friends , tuco .
uh , right .
it' s good to see old friends again .
good .
especially when they' ve come ... from so far away .
we have so much to talk about .
mm hmm .
and you do have a lot to talk about ... haven' t you ?
you were captured near , uh ...
fort craig .
mm hmm .
mm hmm .
well , if you were with sibley ... that means then that you , uh ... were coming from santa fe .
mm hmm .
was it hard crossing the desert ?
mm hmm .
very hard .
especially if you don' t have anything to drink .
why are you going under the name ... of bill carson now ?
one name is as good as another .
not wise to use your own name .
like you !
i' il bet they don' t call you angel eyes .
ha ha .
sergeant angel eyes .
like a little music with your meal , tuco ?
music ?
yes , it' s very good .
very good for the digestion .
so ...
bill carson' s a fake name , huh ?
hmm .
that fake , too ?
bill carson' s name' s written on it .
have some .
it' s bill carson' s tobacco .
aah !
aagghh aagghh .
was carson dead or alive when you found him ?
what' d he tell you about the money ?
i ... don' t ...
i ...
i don' t know ... what you' re talking about .
aah !
more feeling .
you can sure consider yourself ... much luckier than your pal .
wallace will punch your friend ... as long as the song goes .
so many of us have had a session in there .
ohh .
ohh .
how' s your digestion now ?
you' d better talk .
i have nothing to tell you .
aah !
play that fiddle , you .
a aaah !
aah aahh !
i ...

where ?
to find $200, 000 .
i know the name of the cemetery now ... and you know the name of the grave .
you' re not going to give me the same treatment ?
would you talk ?
no .
probably not .
that' s what i thought .
not that you' re any tougher than tuco ... but you' re smart enough ... to know that talking won' t save you .
and tuco ... is he ...
mm mmm .
no .
not yet .
but he' s in very good hands .
you' ve changed partners ... but you still got the same deal .
i' m not greedy .
i' m only taking half .
there' s two of us .
it should make it easier than just one .
yeah .
hold it .
that' s it .
don' t move .
now don' t breathe .
still ... that' s it .
ahh ...
got it .
thank you .
hey , corporal , afraid he' il get lost ?
where' s the rebel going ?
to hell , with a rope around his neck ... and a price on his head .
yeah .
three thousand dollars , friend .
that' s a lot of money for a head .
i' il bet they didn' t even ... pay you a penny for your arm .
i told you once , friend ... if i ever get you down ... you' re gonna need a lot of help to get up again .
you' re a lot luckier than that one there .
you' il get some proper rope ... and you' re all finished .
and there isn' t any partner this time to shoot you down .
get up .
sure would like to put your paw on it , huh ?
i would like to piss .
it' s rough .
i' ve been shaken up on this train ... nearly ten hours now .
you smell like a pig already ... but let' s try not to make things any worse .
get going .
i can' t while you' re watching me .
aah !
you made a lot of noise , my friend , huh ?
you don' t want to break our friendship , huh ?
well , i' il break it .
halt .

hmm .
i been looking for you for eight months .
whenever i should' ve had a gun in my right hand ...
i thought of you .
now i find you in exactly the position that suits me .
i had lots of time to learn how to shoot with my left .
when you have to shoot , shoot .
don' t talk .
every gun makes its own tune .
and it' s perfect timing , large one .

how the hell did you get out of that pigsty ?
my own way .
i' m here with your old friend angel eyes .
you talked , you traitor .
you talked .
no , i didn' t talk .
if i did , i probably wouldn' t be here now .
you ... mean ... so only you know ... your half of the secret ?
mm hmm .
ahh ... ha ha ha , blondie !
i' m very happy ... you' re working with me ... and we' re together again .
i get dressed , i kill him ... and be right back .
oh , listen , uh ...
i forgot to mention ... uh , he' s not alone .
there' s five of them .
five ?
yeah , five of them .
so that' s why you came to tuco ?
it doesn' t matter .
i' il kill them all .
they shot him at close range .
well , look who' s here .
the other one will be along .
they' il come looking for us .
