you' re 7 today .
you' re a man now
bury your first toy and the portrait of your mother
the mole
the mole is an animal that digs tunnels underground
ln search of the sun , it sometimes comes to the surface
when it sees the sun , it is blinded
kill me !
kill me , please !
who was it ?
kill me , for pity' s sake !
who was it ?
who ?
who ?
it' s the colonel how many ?
another five men
where ?
ln the franciscan mission
the colonel' s not selfish .
he uses women once and gives them away
the colonel said he' d kill anyone who touches me
and who told you to ?
don' t anticipate my wishes !
sorry !
they have no souls ,
but sometimes they get bored and i throw them my leftovers
come on , dogs !
take your little piece !
stop , dogs !
kiss them on the mouth
keep going !
kiss the other too !
stop , dogs !
be good
these dogs like to watch
they want to see your breasts
eat , dogs !
who are you to hand out justice ?
i' m god
no ... this no !
don' t do this to me !
no !
destroy me .
never depend on anyone
cry little boy !
cry and then he' il pity you
it' s bitter
moses found water in the desert
the people couldn' t drink it because it was bitter
the water was named marah
it' s turned sweet !
i' il call you marah because you' re like bitter water
how will we live here ?
we' il die of thirst
as the deer yearns for water , so my soul invokes you , lord
my soul is thirsty for god , for the living god
nothing
nothing
nothing , nothing , nothing , nothing
nothing , nothing , nothing , nothing
nothing , nothing , nothing , nothing
do you love me ?
yes
me no .
for me to love you , you' ve got to be better
the four masters of the gun live in this desert
i must find them and kill them
the desert is round .
to find the 4 masters we must move in a spiral
i can' t go on , let' s go back !
i always end up where i started
we' il never find them
lf they' re masters , they' il give us a sign
days have passed ... weeks , months
how can you still have faith ?
they' re waiting for us
the sign !
seek the light at midday .
he' il come .
you must wait to see him
like that woman
the master didn' t want to fight her
the master wants to receive you know .
it' s strange ... he never receives people without making them wait
there' s an oasis behind the dune
your woman will wait there
let' s go
give me the gun and the sombrero
i don' t need the light .
i' m blind
count to three and try to take it
one ... two ... three !
how ?
i do not try to win , but to arrive at perfect control to not be afraid of the bullets
shoot !
they hardly bleed .
i offer no resistance to the bullet
i let it pass through the capillaries of my flesh
you still want to duel with me ?
yes
it does not grieve me to kill you , because death does not exist
i will let you shoot first
he' s superior to me you' il win !
even if i won , i' d lose
i' m asking you a favour .
you must win
don' t be so honest .
try to invent something
lay a trap .
there' s always a way to win .
find it !
i told you !
i expected it , i' m proud of you !
there are only 3 masters left
i know where the 2nd lives . lf you let me come with you , i' il show you
he' s here , wait for me
we were waiting for you .
the cards say this about you
you' re falling and you' il fall anyway
the deeper you fall , the higher you' il get
traitor , coward , murderer !
god' s will is unexplainable
my son and i must respect you
you can duel with him
cross !
the duel starts right now
you and my son can shoot when you want
dead !
technically you' re dead
now i want to talk to the dead one
follow me
first of all , i made things out of copper and i strengthened my fingers
now i make delicate objects
i' m so strong that i can play with this shape without breaking it
shoot !
a clean , delicate shot
destroys an accurate one
you shoot to find yourself
i do it to shoot
perfection is to lose yourself and to lose yourself you need to love
you don' t love .
you destroy , kill and no one loves you
because when you think you' re giving , you' re really taking
i' ve given myself to her .
i told her everything
she' s inside me
her infinite love fills me
what i do and say is ordered and blessed by her
i hate all that is mine because it distances me from her divine presence
two are better than one , because if they fall , one will lift up his companion
when there is only one , there is no one to lift him up
when i made this , i didn' t think it would be useful
i just tried to make it the best way i possibly could
take your gun again
my son wants to give you one last chance
prophets
i don' t want you to go near him
why do you follow us ?
go away !
we don' t need to take your gun away .
we trust you
you have a flute !
we' il get to know each other through music
you' re disgusted at yourself .
you don' t want to betray any more
now you want to respect the law
some give flowers .
some , precious objects
you bring me your life as a gift
you are not afraid to die
this is why you are a dangerous enemy
when you were 7 metres from the rabbit run , my rabbits started to die .
now they' re nearly all dead
now that you' re here , not one will be left alive
i made it .
feel how fine it is ...
you can fire a shot
it is all that i need .
a fatal shot
shoot !
which did you kill and which did i kill ?
this is yours : shot in the head .
this is mine : shot in the heart
the heart ... the head ...
a changing of places
it is now time
too much perfection is a mistake
you won !
don' t leave me !
you' il be the best and i' il help you !
there' s only one left !
want to duel with me ?
how will i do that ?
i have no gun
i bartered the pistol for a butterfly net
i must fight you with my hands
fight !
fight !
fight !
see ?
my net is more powerful than your bullets
lf you shoot again , i' il reflect the bullet directly into your heart
how can you win if i don' t duel ?
i have nothing
even with a trap you couldn' t have taken anything from me
yes , actually , i could have taken your life
i don' t care about my life
now i' il show you
you lost
you won !
you won !
you' re the best !
i was poured out like water and my bones were all detached
it' s like my heart shrivelled inside my guts
my tongue cleaved to my palate
and they put me in the dust of the dead
my god , my god , why have you forsaken me ?
why are you so far from my salvation and from the voice of my lament ?
my god , i call you by day but you do not answer
i call by night and there is no peace
him or me
show me your way , your paths
show me the way of your truth
because you are the god of my salvation and i waited for you
you will show your sinners the way
you will put the humble on the path of justice
psalms
i am not a god .
i am a man
how long have i been here ?
when you got here , i hadn' t been born
i looked after you from infancy .
the old woman says you' il free us
come
we' ve been prisoners in this cave for many years
that' s the only exit .
to get there we need to scale the walls and many days
outside there' s the mountain and a big village
they won' t help us get out
we' re deformed from continuous incest .
we disgust them
it was difficult to bring me here .
why did you do it ?
the old woman knows
she sent us to find you .
now she wants to see you
this is not my face !
this is not me !
i' il find money and dig a tunnel in the mountain
the tunnel will unite the village and this cave
when the tunnel is finished , you' il finally be free
you' il get out of here
this is the big village
we should beg
see to my curls !
paint my nails !
the cream
fan
this pervert is looking at my legs !
help !
he' s forcing himself on me !
you saw him kiss me roughly !
disgusting slave !
how dare you ?
help , he' s raping us !
don' t let him get away !
murderer !
bring him here !
rapist !
you' re really degenerate !
get him !
get him !
murderer !
murderer !
you think it' s worthwhile for my people to come here ?
this is worse than the other
i' il keep digging
how many metres have we dug now ?
there' s more to go !
we' ve lost our public
hey , monsters !
monsters , come here !
come on , come here !
we' il pay you well
they' re both dead
who died first ?
this one
he' s the champion !
protect us , lord
protect us , lord
protect us , lord
protect us , lord
god loves us !
god protects us !
lf we have faith , nothing can happen to us
we must gamble with god
the stake is death and who doesn' t believe in god will die !
protect us , lord
miracle !
miracle !
protect us , lord
protect us , lord
miracle !
protect us , lord
miracle !
don' t tremble , the safety' s on
miracle !
it' s a miracle !
miracle !
apocalypse
no one will come any more .
the circus is over .
i' il go too
come in !
as is the custom , the league of worthy women , after the monthly inspection , congratulates your husbands
everything' s decent here
want to earn money ?
come with me
go down there
come
do the kissing number !
now we want to see the sequel !
come on , strip off !
i love you !
they don' t exist !
there' s only you here
we' re alone !
love me , please !
we can buy the dynamite and keep on digging the tunnel
why are you hiding ?
i' m ashamed .
now i disgust you and you' il abandon me
no , come with me
tell him to marry us
go on !
we' re getting married , father
no , you can' t kill him !
he hasn' t finished his work !
... and he promised to dig the tunnel so we can be free
i' il wait till you finish the work .
then i' il kill you
but i' il watch you day and night so you won' t escape
you' il never finish !
you' re taking too long
lf you want us to hurry , help us to finish
and if you want to finish quickly ... help us to beg
this rock' s too hard .
we' ve hit it a thousand times !
only 1 , 000 times ?
the pain must be unbearable
my body feels pain .
not i
you' il never do it .
that' s enough !
you' ve done it !
you' ve done it !
don' t tell him !
i' m not ready !
i can' t kill my master
