rough night ?
i got your message .
what' s the problem ?
i lost my keys .
where' d you find them ?
four feet that way .
must' ve dropped them .
how you doing ?
it' s been a while .
fine .
how are you ?
cold .
i , uh ...
i need to talk to you about something .
grab some lunch at fascastti' s ?
i have to get back to work .
speaking of which , i heard you got fired a few weeks ago .
what was it this time ?
you really want to know ?
or you' re just enjoying the view from your high horse ?
you know what i want ?
to not have to be the older brother to my older brother .
what you doing here , crab ?
long time no see , mr.
linc .
where you been ?
here and there .
mm .
i' m gonna get your 90 grand , all right ...
oh , relax , man , that debt' s already been paid .
by who ?
someone who likes to do people favors .
i don' t know what it is you' re thinking you' re getting , but let' s be clear about something .
it' s gonna be a few days before i get the money lined up .
let' s not kid ourselves .
you can' t get anywhere near that kind of money .
so let' s talk about what you can do for me .
allies are like family .
we have disagreements , but we always seem to smooth things out by thanksgiving .
okay , if you had to choose ...
vice president reynolds or kathy in hr ?
i' il take door number three .
come on , if you had to choose .
the chick in hr .
michael never cared much for blondes .
v.
how you doing , michael ?
um , good .
i' m good .
how are you ?
i' m okay .
you know , i' m over at glazer & ross .
lawyer # 97 .
benefits are good .
how' s lincoln ?
you guys haven' t talked ?
no , not for a few years .
he kind of dropped off the radar .
how is he ?
he' s , um ...
he' s ...
he' s linc .
i don' t care who the guy is .
i ain' t killing no one .
i must have missed the part where i gave you a choice .
black leather jacket .
two buttons down the front , three on each sleeve .
one missing on his left no , right arm .
jeans .
faded .
stain on the right knee .
he does bad things to good people .
think of this as a $90, 000 bullet .
you start fresh , and you keep me from finding out if there' s someone in your life you will do something for .
uh , i should ...
i should call you a cab .
you know how you can tell god is a man ?
shoes .
oh !
easy .
i' m sorry .
what ?
it' s , uh ...
you' re gonna answer it ?
he' il leave a message .
he always does .
michael , it' s linc .
i need your help , bro .
i' m in something real bad .
i can' t get out of it .
i need you to straighten me out .
my head is all messed up and ...
anyway , it' s real important , bro .
you gotta call me .
you gotta call me now .
we can' t do this .
i know .
i know .
i' il call you a cab .
did we get him ?
i believe we did , partner .
whoo !
are you kidding ?
nando , we should' ve whooped that guy' s ass .
please , only time i seen you whoop some ass is when that old man cut in front of you at arby' s .
and he was , like , 102 and blind .
with a plastic hip .
oh , my god .
w hat ?
hey , they' re waiting for you in 4b .
oh , pull his film .
i' il be there in a minute .
okay .
sergeant franklin , you never cease to amaze me .
is there anything you can' t get here ?
all right , a deal' s a deal .
prison guard duty .
away from the front .
safest place you could be .
thank you .
and my wife and daughter back home thank you , too , sir .
these cold seams are pretty significant .
hey .
hi .
would you give us a minute ?
thanks .
have you been watching the news ?
why ?
it' s lincoln .
i didn' t do it .
terrence steadman ?
the vice president' s brother .
do you have any idea what they' re gonna do to you ?
i didn' t do it , man , it was a setup .
i didn' t do it .
you knew him .
who ?
steadman .
no .
you worked for his company .
so what ?
from which you were fired a few weeks ago .
i loaded containers in the warehouse .
never met the guy .
what the hell , mike ?
you sound like one of the damn detectives .
i' m just saying ...
you think i did it ?
i heard you owe someone 90 grand .
who told you that ?
people talk .
and i know steadman had a lot of money .
i may be a lot of things , but i' m not a murderer .
then what were you doing in that garage last night ?
you admitted to the police you were there .
honestly , linc , i don' t know how it' s come to this .
and you can' t keep blaming mom for dying and dad for leaving , because i was there , too .
difference is , i got out .
mom had life insurance , i took my half , put myself through school ,
what did you do with your half , linc ?
everything' s not how it looks , michael .
i hope for your sake , that' s true .
here ... here is where we want the turn to anger .
trust me , that won' t be a problem .
now remember to stress his record as a repeat offender .
we need the public behind us if we want the death penalty .
and where are we with governor tancredi ?
he has aspirations .
he won' t be a problem .
uh , 30 seconds , madam vice president .
the papers have already crucified him .
the police say they got a phone call right after the murder from someone claiming they saw lincoln running from the garage .
he was into someone for 90 grand .
what do you need that kind of money for ?
drugs ?
bribes ?
forget about what you want to be true .
let' s look at this objectively .
maybe you should , too .
i am .
all right , you know what ?
i promised i wouldn' t say anything , but i' m getting tired of you talking about him
like he' s some guy from the neighborhood that you used to know .
he' s your brother .
i know , and i know he helped you out with your dad back in the day , but you should see the kind of person he is now the kind of people he keeps friends with .
you want to know what the 90 grand was for ?
i think i do .
you .
what do you mean ?
the money you got when you were 18 years old from your mother' s life insurance .
the money that paid for your degree , that got you this job , that bought you your loft .
your mother never had life insurance .
that money came from lincoln .
how ?
he borrowed it .
knew it would be tough to pay back , but that didn' t matter , because he thought you deserved it .
he also knew you' d never accept it if you knew it came from him .
michael .... you are where you are because of your brother .
you' re telling me he is where he is because of me ?
why ?
why didn' t you tell me about the money ?
no need to .
lincoln ...
who told you ?
veronica ?
what did she make of all this ?
about me ?
i don' t know .
glad she got out when she did , huh ?
you know how she feels about you .
it' s been the same way ever since we were kids .
yeah .
linc ...
i owe you an apology .
for what ?
the night you called .
if we talked , maybe i could have stopped you ...
hey , hey , hey , hey .
it' s not your fault .
then whose is it ?
listen up .
you need to forget about this .
move on .
work hard , do what you do .
i can' t do that .
oh , yes , you can .
and you will .
here' s the part i don' t understand .
all the evidence is lining up in a path that leads directly to you .
they say they have you on tape .
pulling the trigger .
if you didn' t kill terrence steadman ...
how the hell did someone make it look like you did ?
perfect .
perfect' s a strong word , cuz .
i got strong feelings , bro .
i' m telling you , she might be the one .
she from the block ?
nope .
uptown .
pill hill .
do you think you could hold on to a girl from the ph ?
i want to take her out to dinner .
you' il see .
someplace real nice .
come on , fernando .
how are you going to afford a place like that ?
open the drawer !
hey , hey , okay !
open the drawer !
yo , yo !
okay , okay !
quick !
quick !
quick !
all right , okay !
now !
actually ...
this is all i need .
okay .
appreciate your business , man .
ah ...
i brought you a gift from the hospital .
oh !
oh ...
i brought you a gift from the hospital .
i' m telling you , this is like christmas .
and you ... work at the north pole .
if the north pole had gunshot wounds and ...
seriously , i don' t know how you work there .
what do you mean ?
i like to help people .
and you like helping yourself .
and you like helping your friend .
oh , my god .
oh , my god !
call somebody !
who' s got a telephone ? !
call 911 !
help !
are you a doctor ?
well , do something !
at ease .
the whiskey that you ordered , sir , will be here in a couple of days .
that' s fine .
i actually brought you here to talk to you about something else .
prisoner abuse report you filed ?
yes , sir .
i need to know how far you' re willing to go with this .
whatever it takes , sir .
i particularly have no love for the desert donkeys , but i do have some for the geneva convention .
something like this gets out , might open up our boys to similar treatment from the enemy .
i understand that , sir .
but i' m not planning on calling a press conference .
what i' m saying is , what i saw was wrong , and someone needs to take responsibility for it , sir .
all right .
please take mr.
franklin into custody .
what ?
what the hell is going on , sir ? !
sergeant franklin , i' m hereby recommending that you be dishonorably discharged from the united states army .
what ? !
for what ?
for engaging in illegal , black market ...
you asked me to get that stuff !
i kept it to myself .
maybe you should learn to do the same .
you can' t do this .
you can' t do this !
you cannot do this !
has the jury reached a verdict ?
we have , your honor .
what say you ?
in the matter of the people of the state of illinois v. lincoln burrows , on the count of murder in the first degree , we find the defendant guilty .
the defendant will remain in custody until one week from today , when we commence the penalty phase .
lincoln .
i' m so sorry , linc .
don' t be .
it' s not your fault .
know what i like ?
hmm ?
how after we make love ... you get this little puddle of water in your belly button .
fernando , that' s sweat !
and get out of there !
it' s disgusting there !
i think it' s beautiful .
i think you' re beautiful .
what do you want , fernando ?
oh , you got to give me a few more minutes .
stop !
from the future .
what do you want from the future ?
would you run if i said you ?
would you chase me if i did ?
i don' t get it .
all these commercials show brothers learning computer skills , new technologies .
uncle sam didn' t teach me nothing but cadence and kill .
you check over at the price mart ?
ain' t hiring .
especially with a brother with a dishonorable discharge .
goes right to the bottom of the pile .
how long you think you gonna keep this up ?
until somebody gives me a job .
nah , i' m talking about lying to kacee .
your unit' s been on leave for a long damn time now .
pretty soon they gonna stop thinking you' re lucky , and she' s gonna start asking questions .
yeah , well , then i need to start finding some answers .
look , i happen to know of an employment opportunity .
come on , man , you know i don' t get down like that .
it' s just driving a truck .
yeah .
a to b. that' s it .
uncle sam taught you how to drive trucks , didn' t he ?
yeah .
he also taught me to look inside .
it might be illegal , but it' s also rent .
a to b , your call .
yeah .
they didn' t even let her testify .
who ?
leticia barris .
and that cop ?
changed his story a dozen times .
what part of " move on " don' t you get ?
after mom died , and it was just you and me .
i remember having trouble sleeping , never knowing where you were .
but when i' d wake up in the morning , there' d be this paper bird , an origami crane , sitting next to my bed .
and i never knew what it meant exactly , but i figured it was your way of letting me know you were checking in on me .
anyway , i looked it up .
the crane .
it stands for familial obligation ... watching out for your own .
maybe it' s my turn to watch out for you .
so , same time tomorrow .
no , man , they' re , uh , transferring me to a prison where i wait until they execute me .
can i still visit ?
yeah .
it' s not that far .
place called fox river .
fox river ?
yeah .
why ?
nothing .
how come there' s four ?
well , uh , mommy' s new friend is coming over for dinner again .
again ?
he just came over last night .
i like him .
well , i do , too .
and i want you both to be extra polite , because he' s stopping by malarkey' s on his way home from work , and he' s bringing us a really good meal .
in fact , you two go wash your hands .
evening , mrs. hollander .
don' t you look lovely this evening .
ay ...
i' m gonna do it .
do what ?
i' m gonna propose to maricruz .
are you serious ?
when ?
as soon as i can afford the ring .
so what , like , 10 , 20 years ?
what' s your problem , man ?
why can' t you just be happy for me ?
i' m just trying to protect you .
what , you think you can give her everything she wants ?
takes more than money to do that .
you know i love you , cuz .
just think you should look at the reality here .
seriously , primo , how are you gonna afford a ring for a girl like that , huh ?
open the door !
hey , hey , hey , okay , okay !
now !
hey , this fine ?
actually , i' m gonna need a little bit more this time .
okay , okay .
here you go .
i' m sorry .
okay .
anyone asking questions ?
not loud enough to hear .
god , i can' t remember the last time i was this much of a nervous wreck .
school board , second term , 1992 ?
secluded , no real access roads , perfect for what you' re looking for .
only one problem .
what' s that ?
it' s over $2 million .
didn' t my poor brother , terrence , leave something for me in his will ?
you' d have to ask your accountants , ma' am .
tell them to use that money .
i' m paying for his mistake ; he can pay for the damn house .
and i' ve been clean for 18 months now .
i' il tell you , i' ve never been happier .
that actually might be the wrong word .
i' il be honest , there were times i was using i left pretty damn happy .
but ... what i feel is different now .
i feel , uh ...
i feel joy .
so here i am .
i know that ... all i can do every day is the next right thing .
and i think , for me right now , that means going back to work .
i , uh ...
i don' t know , maybe ... maybe counseling , um ...
i want to help people get from where i' ve been to where i am .
hey , sara .
you used to be a doctor , right ?
uh , i still am , in theory .
why ?
well , i was just thinking that
i might know of a job opening where i work .
really ?
where' s that ?
you ever heard of fox river ?
the prison ?
yeah .
i know it sounds like a strange idea .
uh , maybe ... maybe you and i could , uh ... maybe we could talk about it over dinner .
i got a gift card to the red lobster over off the interstate .
oh , my god .
um ...
thank you .
really .
uh ...
i ...
tonight' s kind of my night to work on my resume .
um ...
oh .
yeah .
' course .
sorry .
i , uh ...
but thank you , really , for the , um , the referral .
fox river .
yeah .
you know , math was never my best subject , either .
but , um ...
i got through it by learning some new tricks .
you want to learn some tricks , gracey ?
like what ?
like your nine times tables .
ready ?
nine times one is ...
nine .
nine times two is ...
eight ... een .
teen .
yeah .
nine times three is ...
twenty seven !
exactly .
you got it .
now keep on going .
mommy , mommy , did you see what teddy taught me ?
yes .
that' s great , honey .
go show your brother .
zack , look .
nine times one ...
thank you .
right , right , left , left ...
hey .
um , thank you .
let me get your change .
you want your change ?
keep it .
hey .
hey .
daddy !
hey , sweetheart , come here .
hey , there .
hey .
you know , i got , uh ...
i got to tell you something .
and it' s going to be really hard to hear .
okay .
okay .
what ?
well , the thing is ...
... i' m being shipped back off .
what ?
yeah , um , my unit just got called back for another tour , baby .
i can' t believe it .
deployment orders just came down .
with the italians pulling out and everything ...
tell them no , daddy !
aw .
yo , b !
come here , baby .
can you give me a hand with something out back ?
that' s my sister you' re lying to in there .
which is why i know you' re gonna take care of them when i' m gone .
this is crazy .
maybe .
so is the way i got kicked out the army .
so' s the way i got busted for driving that truck .
and so' s the way i feel about that woman up in there .
she married a military man , who knows how to take care of his business .
now , if i look like one of these thugs , now ... what do you think she' s gonna do ?
huh ?
how long you think she' s gonna wait for me while i' m inside ?
i don' t know , man .
you owe me this , man .
don' t you ever let her know where i am .
you feel me ?
usually , i do this the other way .
why do you want to ...
i want what i want .
you show this to anyone else ...
i am calling the whole thing off .
my therapist said ... she said that i' m holding too much in and that i need to confront you to let you know how betrayed i feel .
i let you into my life , my home ...
my god , i let you near my children !
i never touched them .
you should have told me what you were .
you think you' re the only one who feels betrayed ?
i ... loved you , susan .
real love .
for the first time in my life .
and then to have you do me like that , to just throw me out to the dogs , just toss me out the back door like ...
you' re a murderer , teddy !
that' s not ...
i have sinned in the past , but when i met you , that person , that one that did all those terrible things , he died , and i was reborn .
by the grace of your love , i was a ... a new man , a better man .
no .
that doesn' t just erase the man who killed 6 students in alabama .
i guess that' s where you' re right .
' cause when you sent me here , to this place , with these people , it brought that old , dirty bastard right back home .
in fact , there was a candle in the window , just waiting for me to walk up them front steps .
you know , i' m gonna ...
i' m gonna get out of here someday .
and when i do ...
... don' t think i won' t remember what your front steps look like , susan .
it' s almost over .
burrows will be dead soon , and then things will start getting back to normal .
i know that you' ve been through a lot , but i promise you , the worst is now behind us .
my dear sister ... ... you have no idea what i' ve been through .
good night , terrence .
