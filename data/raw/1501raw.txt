ok , go on through .
all metal objects into the tray .
purpose of visit ?
a patient pick up and transfer to smith' s grove .
you' re late .
yeah .

yeah .
hell of a night , huh ?
real charmer .
yeah .
i' il take you down there .
all right .
let them in .
ok .
first time here , huh ?
hope it' s the last time .
you never get used to the faces .
never .
jesus !
jesus ain' t got nothing to do with this place .
come on .
yeah , this is where the society dumps its worst nightmares .
yeah the one you' re picking up ...
just thinking about him gives me the willies .
a decade ago , halloween night ...
he murdered 16 people ... maybe more .
trying to get to his sister .
nearly got her too .
but his doctor ... of all people , shot him ... six times .
then he set him on fire .
both of them nearly burned to death .
yeah , i' il be glad to see this one gone .
yes , indeedy !
welcome to hell .
doctor ?
yes ?
the transfer personnel are here .
smith' s grove ?
yes .
i' m dr. hoffman , medical administrator .
has he been prepped ?
ready to go .
who signs for him ?
i do .
outside .
check him out .
i' d assumed dr. loomis would be here .
michael myers is still his patient .
well , if loomis read memos , he' d be here .
fortunately his position is more ceremonial than medical .
and with myers gone ...
my hope is that he' il either transfer ... retire ... or die .
all right , let' s move him .
watch it .
i got this end .
i can safely say that michael myers is now in your hands .
yeah .
i guess you' re happy to see him go .
locked and loaded .
let' s roll .
night , doc .
drive carefully .
did hoffman say anything about living relatives ?
yeah .
a niece living in his hometown .
and ?
and ? " she' s too young to be his legal ward .
so the state owns him ?
great .
you know , i still don' t understand .
no !
kido ...
it' s 4 : 00 in the morning .
i can' t sleep .
what is this ?
four nights in a row ?
you going for a record here ?
the seven year old insomniac' s hall of fame ?
do you love me , rachel ?
serious questions tonight .
of course i love you .
like a sister ?
jamie , sometimes it' s ...
like a real sister ?
we' re not really sisters , jamie .
but that doesn' t mean that i love you any less .
sure it does .
i know you miss your parents .
it hasn' t been that long .
it' s been 11 months .
your mother used to baby sit me when i was your age .
i' il bet you didn' t know that .
you' re lucky .
i wish she could do the same for me .
come on , jamie .
let' s go back to bed .
come on , sunday .
sleep tight .
we' il have french toast for breakfast , ok ?
nighty night .
come on , sunday .
nighty night .
now i lay me down to sleep , i pray the lord my soul to keep .
if i should die before i wake , i pray the lord my soul will take .
god bless mr. and mrs. corruthers .
god bless rachel , god bless sunday , god bless me .
and god bless mommy and daddy in heaven .
amen .
help me please !
somebody help me !
help me !
jamie !
oh , dear god !
it' s all right , sweetheart .
a bad dream .
that' s all .
just a nasty old dream .
i' ve got you .
you' re safe now , see ?
it' s okay , baby .
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
shh .
you' re gonna be just fine .
it' s okay , baby .
you' re gonna be fine .
damn it !
darlene !
there' s a clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks .
hello ?
honey , this tie' s got a spot on it .
i can' t wear this today .
i got a 10 : 30 with chuck .
hang on , mrs. pierce .
not that tie .
on the other side .
that' s not the only thing you' re eating , rachel !
mom , i' m on a diet .
you want an oinker for a daughter ?
found it .
sorry .
do you suppose susan could just bring her crutches ?
stupid question .
tell her i hope she feels better .
susan' s mother .
she can' t baby sit tonight .
why not ?
susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink .
rachel ?
mom , please .
you' il have to watch jamie tonight .
not tonight .
i' ve got that date with brady .
you know how important that is .
well .
tonight is very important for your father and me .
can' t you find somebody else ?
it' s too late .
what am i supposed to tell brady ?
sorry , but i' ve got to baby sit my foster sister .
go and have fun by yourself .
it' s not exactly the end of the world for goodness ' sake .
oh , sure it is .
i think tonight brady was ready to make a commitment .
but now , my future relationship my engagement ... my marriage , my children and your grandchildren have all been wiped out , because i have to baby sit .
i' m sorry i ruined everything .
if i wasn' t here , you could go out .
good job , rachel .
that little girl needs all the love we can give her right now .
and all you can do is think about yourself ?
jamie ?
i' m sorry .
i didn' t mean it like that .
i can go out with brady tomorrow night .
it' s no big deal .
but you wanted to go out tonight .
it' s my fault you can' t .
well , tonight we' re going to do something better .
we' re going to go trick or treating .
i don' t want to .
it' s halloween !
i mean : don' t you want to get dressed up in a really scary costume and get some candy ?
how ' bout this afternoon i pick you up from school and we go get ice cream ?
double scoops ?
double scoops .
now let' s get some breakfast .
dr. quinn , call 7402 .
why wasn' t i notified ?
about what ?
you know damn well about what .
you let them take it out of here .
for christ' s sake , spare me the speech .
i' ve listened to it for a decade .
the fact is that michael myers was a federal patient and a federal prisoner .
therefore he' s subject to federal law .
we' re not talking about any ordinary prisoner , hoffman .
we are talking about an evil on two legs .
i can see this is useless .
do you know what today is ?
do you know the date ?
every day i look at myself in the mirror and ...
and every day i remember .
look at me ...
hoffman !
take a good look !
i don' t want anyone to have to live through that night again .
i' ve said this before .
i think you' re the one who needs mental help .
yes ?
dr. hoffman .
i see .
i see .
thank you .
apparently there was an accident just south of mill creek near the bri ...
loomis ?
loomis !
is that it ?
yes .
when did this happen ?
sometime in the night .
they probably lost the road in the storm .
come down the embankment .
it happens .
an accident ?
yes , sir .
do you believe that ?
why shouldn' t i ?
how many people in the bus ?
four ... plus myers .
how many bodies did you find ?
it' s hard to tell , they' re all chewed up .
loomis ?
it' s over .
leave it alone .
he' s gone .
he was here ... ... but he' s gone .
did you find any other bodies ?
not yet .
there' s a lot of ground to cover .
you won' t find him .
he' s done all this .
now he' s escaped .
you don' t know that .
michael could' ve been thrown from the bus .
i' ve seen bodies thrown 50 60 feet from a crash site .
even if by some miracle michael' s conscious ... his ... his muscles would be totally useless .
give the troopers a chance to search .
you' re talking about him as if he were a human being .
that part of him died years ago .
now where are you going ?
haddonfield .
it' s a four hour drive .
you can reach me through the local police .
if you don' t find him in four hours ...
i' m sure i will .
hey gar .
how ' bout a 9/ 16 socket over here ?
hey !
hey there !
hello !
hello ?
hello ?
is anybody here ?
hello ?
hello !
is anybody here ?
god in heaven .
michael ?
why now ?
you waited ten years .
i knew this day would come .
don' t go to haddonfield .
if you want another victim , take me .
but leave those people in peace .
please ...
michael .
goddamn you .
michael !
hey jamie !
where' s your costume ?
where' s your mask ?

loomis .
folks around here aren' t likely to forget your face .
at least not cops .
so , what brings you back here after ten years ?
michael myers ... has escaped from ridgemont .
he' s here in haddonfield .
that' s impossible .
michael myers is an invalid .
he' s here , sheriff .
why ?
ten years ago ...
he tried to kill laurie strode .
now he wants her daughter .
are you talking about jamie lloyd ?
wherever she is , that little child is in mortal danger .
myers has been locked up since before she was born .
he' s never laid eyes on her .
six bodies ...
sheriff !
that' s what i' ve seen between here and ridgemont .
a filling station in flames !
i tell you , michael myers is here in this town !
he' s here to kill that little girl and anybody who gets in his way .
all right , pierce , call the troopers and check his story out .
and assuming what you say is true .
it' s true , sheriff !
all right , all right .
it' s true .
what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of ten years ago ?
find this little girl .
get her someplace safe .
call the local tv station .
tell them to get people off the streets and behind locked doors .
can' t get long distance , sheriff .
operator says the lines are down .
all right , let' s go .
