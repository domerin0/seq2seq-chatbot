* and break away
this has been elsie kentworthy and former miss genovia , hildegaard huffman , at the best independence day parade genovia' s seen in years .
thanks to princess mia' s special surprise .
may the rest of your day be sunny side up .
and so , gentlemen , the children from the shelter will be housed at the winter castle in the mountains of libbet .
the use of the castle as a resort is sort of a perk for parliament members and dignitaries .
exactly .
oh .
well , i' m going to de perk it , and convert it into a children' s shelter until money can be raised for one of their own .
i feel guilty having two homes while they have none .
we' re going to have to do something .
where are we gonna ski ?
lord crawley , how is your brother doing ?
i don' t speak to my brother .
oh .
well , i' ve hired him to be the architect on the project .
mr. crawley .
your highness .
gentlemen .
jerry .
dean .
well , i look forward to getting your notes on these plans .
but no one else' s .
oh , i' il give you notes , because i' m part ...
oh , no , you won' t .
i' m an architect .
i am part of this parliament .
oh , you just go skiing ...

oh , and you' re a couch potato .
outdoorsman .
you' re a couch potato .
outdoorsman .
couch potato .
couch potato .
outdoorsman .
outdoorsman .
couch ...
the queen approves of the plan , and i intend to see it through .

queens rarely do karaoke .
grandma , come on .
the song you sang at my 18th birthday party .

they loved it .
dear , we had music then .
mia had a cd made , so you can sing along .
clarisse , clarisse ,
clarisse , clarisse , clarisse ...
some girls are fair , some are jolly and fit .
some have a well bred air , or a well honed wit .
* each one' s a jewel , with a singular shine
* a work of art with its own rare design
* dear little girl , you are terribly blessed
* but it' s your heart of gold i love the best
* and that will be your crowning glory
* your whole life through
* it' il always be your crowning glory
* the most glorious part
* of you

but i don' t know how to do this sort of thing .
asana , now .
grandma , just follow asana and sing . * some boys can walk * some guys can groove

gretchen , hot water .
what are you saying ?
well , she' s smart .
and she really cares about genovia .
maybe ...
well , maybe it wouldn' t be so bad if she ran the country .
are you mad ?
she believes in genovia so much that she' s convinced herself to marry someone that she knows she can never love .
i can' t believe that i am hearing this .
you want her to rule ?
after all the effort that we have put in , to end up with nothing ?
it wouldn' t be nothing .
genovia would be in good hands , and she would be happy .
ah .
you' ve fallen in love with her .
no .
no , uncle , all that i' m asking ...
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , you listen .
what do you think will happen ?
that she will leave andrew and marry you ?
i put in the effort to make you a king , not to have you marry a queen .
i will not have it , sir .
don' t worry , uncle .
that will never happen .
mia doesn' t care for me that way .
oh , but you care for her .
uncle , i just want us to stop trying to sabotage her .
that' s all .
all right .
if that' s what you really want .
i just want your happiness , my boy .
go to her .
congratulate her .
and tell her that we surrender .
thank you , uncle .
elsie kentworthy , please .
that' s enough flaming ones for now .
are you sure i didn' t burn you ?
of course you did .
look at his coat .
no , no , it' s very minor .
you just sort of seared the sleeve .
look .
sorry .
lilly ?
yes ?
can i talk to you for a second ?
uh huh .
look over there .
should i shoo him ?
should i shoo him ?
just tell me who i should shoo and i' il shoo .
i just want to talk to nicholas for a second .
ok .
backing off , please .
andrew ?
yes ?
why don' t you go introduce lilly to your parents ?
you know , just tell them i' il be up for brunch in a second .
yeah , i' d love to meet susan and arnold .
we can have those tasty finger sandwiches together .
would you like some help ?
he' s not the one she' s marrying , is he ?
would you please try to keep up , brigitta ?
he' s trying to steal the crown .
ready ?
mm hm .
take your stance .
ok .
elbow down .
just a bit .
use your mouth as an anchor .
excuse me ?
touch your mouth .
good .
relax this hand .
and breathe in .
release .
oh .
how did that feel ?
wonderful .
wonderful .
turn around .
we should give them some privacy .
i have to go .
i really only came back to pack my things .
you' re leaving ?
i think it' s time i bowed out gracefully .
don' t you ?
goodbye .
bye .
goodbye .
mia .
could i see you one more time before i go ?
nicholas , i' m watched like a hawk .
princess , princess .
see ?
i' il find a way .
yes ?
um , nothing .
i' m just supposed to watch you .
with only two and a half days left , olivia , i' m beginning to feel rather frantic .
would you take maurice out for me , please ?
i have to check the orchestra selections .
and they asked you to approve a place setting for the reception , your majesty .
very well .
our selections for dancing at the royal reception .
have you been thinking about us ?
yes , i have .
i see .
if you' il excuse me .
no , joseph .
you had to know what i was going to say .
mia needs me now more than ever before .
it' s the monarchy .
i mean , as queen it' s my responsibility .
you know how it is .
you were never just my queen , clarisse .
you were the someone that i wanted to spend the rest of my life with .
but , if you prefer that i see you first and foremost as my queen ...
i shall oblige .
no , joseph ...
your majesty .
your bed is turned down , your highness .
if you don' t need anything else , princess , we' re going to supper .
oh .
well , enjoy yourselves , ladies .
ah ah ah .
what did we talk about ?
no more curtsy .
we' re going to supper .
thank you .
hi , miss lilly .
may we announce you ?
i can announce myself .
lilly moscovitz !
mia , look out your window .
why ?
what' s going on ?
just look out your window .
prince charming is throwing pebbles .
nicholas .
nicholas , what are you doing ?
rapunzel , rapunzel , with hair so fine .
come out your window , climb down the vine .
the feat you ask , dear sir , isn' t easy .
and i won' t respond to that line , it' s far too cheesy .
so what does he want ?
he wants me to climb down the vine .
well , do you want to ?
yes .
so go .
it' s a recipe for disaster .
mia , do something impulsive for once in your life .
you' re getting married .
do you want a regular bachelorette party with 12 screaming girls , or do you want a stroll in the moonlight with your almost prince charming ?
i always like a man in shades .
oh , your majesty .
no , no , ladies .
come in , come in .
i was just about to leave .
this really is more romantic in books .
my foot is stuck .
oh , what was that ?
* frere jacques , frere jacques
* dormez vous ?
dormez vous ?
your majesty , we never got to finish our routine at the slumber party .
and there' s more dancing , too .
* frere jacques , frere jacques
* dormez vous ?
dormez vous ?
and there' s a big finish .
yes , the big finale .
i' m sorry .
did i hurt you again ?
no , i ...
i' m used to it .
* sonnez les matines , sonnez les matines
* ding , dang , dong
* ding , dang , dong
what a pity we missed it at the party .
i' il cover for you .
go , rapunzel , go .
tell me your greatest desires .
tell me a secret .
isn' t that the same ?
almost .
but anyone can see your desires .
no one knows what' s in your heart .
tell me something .
um ...
i love i love lucy reruns .
and sometimes i dream in black and white .
i used to pretend i was sick when i had a test in school .
we all did that .
ok .
sometimes , i put chocolate milk on my cereal .
i am deathly afraid of jellyfish .
i haven' t danced with you since your birthday .
that' s a fact .
it' s not a secret .
the secret is , is that ...
i still want to .
* love me tender
* love me sweet
* never let me go
* you have made
* my life complete
* and i love you so
* love me tender
* love me true
* all my dreams fulfill
* for , my darling
* i love you
* and i always will
good morning .
good morning .
hello .
we stayed out all night .
yes , we did .
we stayed out all night .
is that ...
there' s a man in that boat .
what ?
do you see that ?
there' s somebody over there .
he' s probably some fisherman , i suppose .
with a video camera ?
what ?
you' re really low .
no , mia .
i have no idea who that man is .
you know , it' s really a shame he didn' t get juicier stuff last night , you jerk .
mia , i have nothing to do with this .
i swear .
mia , please .
come on .
will you listen to me ?
that is not my boat .
hey , nicholas ?
have a nice life .
but that is my horse .
mia ...
mia ?
hello ?
good morning , my love .
i know it' s a little early , but i' ve been thinking .
things have been so pressured lately .
i was wondering whether we should spend ...
lilly ?
good morning , your majesty .
what ...
what are you doing here ?
i just wanted ...
mia .
doors .
what' s going on ?
princess , i think you should see this .
and here' s the royal exclusive i promised .
after generations of boring royals who never misbehaved ,
genovia finally has a world class scandal .
proving that we should have brought in an american long ago .
will andrew jacoby , duke of kenilworth , still marry such a naughty , naughty princess ?
or will lord nicholas devereaux be the new king ?
it' s out of the frying pan and into the fire for princess mia .
keep your eggs sunny side up .
i' d like to tell her what she can do with her eggs ...
lilly .
could we have a moment alone ?
yes .
so ?
i got played .
a ha .
do we still have a wedding ?
andrew , i am so , so sorry .
excuse me .
andrew , please wait .
i promise you nothing happened .
yes , but mia , you still went , didn' t you ?
you went .
i don' t think you understand .
i' m an extremely eligible bachelor in england .
i really am .
i' ve got plenty of friends , lots of lovely women friends , and ...
i still think this marriage is a good idea .
mia .
the queen would not approve of spying .
ah .
so ?
anything ?
i really want to say yes , but no .
there' s just , there' s no ... spark .
me too .
really ?
really .
i mean , it was pleasurable .
very .
very pleasant , but , but , but no fireworks .
none .
what are we gonna do ?
look , we will ...
we will figure something out .
mia .
you chose me .
no privacy .
you chose me , and i accepted .
and a gentleman never backs out on his word .
we are going to ...
we' re going to stand up in church and say " i do , " and tomorrow we' il be man and wife .
and you are going to make an amazing queen of genovia .
thank you .
i' m getting married today .
she' s getting married today , maurice .
your highness , we' re running very late .
grandma says the queen is never late , everyone else is simply early .
your highness , a strange woman came in and said that she wanted to hide in your closet .
so i let her .
well , dear , that probably wasn' t the wisest decision in the ...
now , this is what i call a closet .
mom .
oh , my darling .
careful .
we' re squashing trevor .
hi .
hi , trevor .
he' s sleeping .
shh .
he is the most beautiful baby brother .
we were joking .
we knew it was your mother .
your stepfather' s here too .
now , i' m your mother , it' s your wedding day , i have to say something .
being married is about being yourself , only with someone else .
thanks , mom .
how are you feeling ?
you look beautiful .
i' m ...
well , i' m ...
you look so calm .
i' m a little ...
paolo is back to turn a caterpillar into a butterfly .
there she go , butterfly .
paolo .
coat off .
i tell you , when i say " butterfly , " the coat comes off .
principessa mia .
paolo .
you remember my mother , helen .
piacere .
the hairdresser .
and a new baby .
monella .
all italian men love baby except paolo .
you got to get out now , because we have to go to work .
five years ago , paolo take you from that to that .
today , he give you this .
a wedding look for the bride .
i look like a moose .
yes , but a very cute moose .
make all the boy moose go ...
i have antlers .
go .
i look like a poodle .
that' s just the way i feel .
here we go again .
good .
sit up .
she kind of does look like a poodle .
i like it .
this time i' m so sure , i use my own pictures .
so .
un , deux , trois .
gretchen ?
i can' t find my gloves .
you go on .
i think it would be better if i didn' t go to the wedding .
my boy .
don' t give up so easily .
come to church .
sweep her off her feet .
in a week or two , she' il be yours .
the game is over , uncle .
she' s going to marry andrew .
ah , you' re so right .
ah , well .
this is a disaster in the making .
wouldn' t miss a moment of it .
i' il try to catch the garter .
the royal carriage approaches .
what did he say , artie ?
the princess is coming .
showtime .
suki sanchez here from the usa .
a long way from home , but happily following a story that started in the streets of san francisco , and is about to have a happy ending here in the small , beautiful land of genovia .
prepare for the arrival of princess mia .
psst .
sir .
i don' t mean to talk out of school , but there' s something you must know .
your uncle called elsie and set you up with that video .
why doesn' t that surprise me ?
i should have known .
he' s up to something .
he was much too delighted that you aren' t going to that wedding .
i must get to that church .
yes , yes , but how ?
everything on four wheels is already rented for the wedding .
doesn' t matter , i' il run .
no , no .
it' s too far .
no , no .
you' il take the bike .
the bike ?
gretchen , what bike ?
we don' t have a bike .
your grandfather' s bike .
buenas tardes , tanya .
buenas tardes , su majestad .
aqui le presento a mi tio , que nos visita de rosario .
oh , how do you do , senor ?
i do better if you and i get married .
i' m sorry .
my uncle learned his english watching the old three stooges movies .
sorry .
yes , well ...
you' re not going to believe this .
lord devereaux' s riding up the road on a bicycle .
sir !
sir , may i borrow your horse ?
oh , he needs my horse .
my bike is yours .
how am i supposed to herd sheep with a bike ?
outspoken american activist lilly moscovitz , the maid of honor , glides forward as a vision in pink .
i' m a girl who loves black and is wearing pink .
aww .
and duke andrew' s little nephew , viscount ludlow , affectionately known as " james of the cherub cheeks , " comes down the aisle as the royal ring bearer .
hey , joe .
hm ?
i just wanted to say , before i do this ...
i' m sorry you' re retiring .
who told you that ?
the maids know everything .
well , the heart does things for reasons that reason cannot understand .
you' re preaching to the choir .
princess ?
yes ?
and you should know that nicholas did not set you up at the lake .
are you sure ?
the maids know everything .
we' re ready when she is .
is this part of the plan ?
no .
i ...
i' m going to need a minute or two .
thank you , your highness .
now the bride is moving swiftly back up the aisle and out the door .
let me .
not the traditional route .
princess mia !
princess mia !
mia !
helen .
honey , i' il be right back .
i gotta change trevor' s diaper .
please , be seated .
there' il just be a momentary interlude .
thank you .
do we rush after her ?
no , we never rush .
we hasten .
you' il take care of this ?
yes , yes .
yes , just one moment .
out of my way .
oh , my dear .
mia .
oh , grandma , i' m sorry .
i' m so sorry .
i ...
i just need a minute .
no .
i can do this .
no .
i can' t do this .
i know .
darling , listen to me .
i made my choice .
duty to my country over love .
it' s what i' ve always done , it seems .
it was drummed into me my whole life .
now i' ve lost the only man i ever really loved .
anyone got a 20 on joseph ?
i' m with the eagle and sparrow .
mia , i want you to make your choices as a woman .
don' t make the same mistakes i did .
make your own mistakes .
there' il be plenty of them , believe me .
now , you can go back into that church and get married , or you can walk away .
whatever choice you make ,
let it come from your heart .
excuse me .
she' s back .
the princess is reentering the church .
she' s walking down the aisle .
more like cantering down the aisle .
andrew , wait .
everyone deserves the chance to find true love , right ?
yes .
including us ?
thank you .
for , for , uh ... saving me from doing the proper thing for once in my life .
now all i have to do is tell mummy .
i have to tell everyone else .
good luck .
helen .
welcome .
a few moments ago , i realized the only reason i was getting married was because of a law , and that didn' t seem like a good enough reason .
so ...
i won' t be getting married today .
sit .
sit .
there may be a dinner .
my grandmother has ruled without a man at her side for quite some time , and ...
i think she rocks at it .
so as the granddaughter of queen clarisse and king rupert ... king rupert .
may he rest in peace .
would you force them to do what you' re trying to make me do ?
i believe i will be a great queen .
i understand genovia to be a land that combines the beauty of the past with all the best hope of the future .
not now .
shh .
i feel in my heart and soul that i can rule genovia .
i ...
i love genovia .
do you think that i would be up here in a wedding dress if i didn' t ?
i stand here , ready to take my place as your queen .
without a husband .
viva mia !
every time ...
every time this charming young lady opens her mouth , she demonstrates a contempt for the customs of genovia .
the law clearly states an unmarried woman cannot be queen .
fortunately , there is another heir .
no , there is not .
i decline .
i refuse to be king .
ladies and gentlemen , it is princess mia who should have the crown .
she' s bright , and she is caring .
but more importantly , she has a vision .
one that will take genovia forward , and if the parliament were astute , they would name her queen .
listen to her .
she' il lead us into the 21 st century .
and besides , just think how lovely she' il look on our postage stamp .
lovely on a postage stamp ?
you would look lovely on a postage stamp !
don' t you walk away from me , sir !
you have a duty , sir , to genovia .
he' s , uh ... he is very distressed .
your duty , sir , to the country !
to me , sir !
to genovia !
for your father !
nicholas !
the door .
shut the doors , quickly .
nicholas .
nicholas !
nicholas , i cannot have you giving all , all this up just for a girl .
now , look , we can still ...
enough , uncle .
we' re finished .
what is happening here ?
who' s next in line for the throne ?
the von trokens ?
we accept .
sit down .
make a motion .
are you ok ?
do you need a ...
make a motion .
ah .
prime minister ?
yes , princess ?
i move to abolish the marriage law , as it applies to present and future queens of genovia .
will anyone second my motion ?
keep eye contact with them .
stare them down .
no , not , not ...
soften .
soften .
good .
i second the motion .
it' s time we had a new tradition .
i like change .
i may grow a mustache .
i think you' d look marvelous with a mustache .
you know , my father always favored a van dyke ...
gentlemen , gentlemen .
please .
all those in favor of abolishing the marriage rule , say , " aye .
aye .
aye .
aye .
aye .
you' re not in parliament .
sit down .
someday .
aye .
the ayes have it .
congratulations , princess .
if i may say so myself , you rule !
lionel .
your majesty ?
hm ?
the princess would like a word .
oh .
erm ...
grandma ?
just because i didn' t get my fairy tale ending , doesn' t mean you shouldn' t .
oh , uh ...
did you hear that ?
not if you didn' t want me to .
oh , charlotte .
well .
joseph ?
your majesty .
dear joseph .
am i too late ... to ask you to accept my hand in marriage ?
well , i thought you' d never ask .
shades ?
you' re in charge now .
good luck with lionel .
i' m going to a wedding .
open up , i say !
the door is shut .
let me in .
put me down .
put me down !
i know it was short notice , but you were all dressed .
my lord archbishop , i would like to take this man as my husband , if you please .
finally .
we have come together for a different wedding ...
what did i miss ?
she' s not getting married .
she' s not getting married ?
no .
with this ring , i thee ... finally ... wed .
now the queen' s getting married .
the queen' s getting married ?
yeah , to joe .
i pronounce you man and wife .
you may kiss the bride .
the ceremonial shooting of the flaming arrow through the coronation ring .
good morning .

* say it all , or not at all
* don' t want to hear what you' re really feeling
* forsaking the meaning
* staring out at the rain with a heavy heart
* it' s the end of the world in my mind
* then your voice pulls me back like a wake up call
* i' ve been looking for the answer
* but now i know what i didn' t know
* because you live and breathe
* because you make me believe in myself
* when nobody else can help
* because you live , girl
* my world
* has twice as many stars in the sky
* because you live , there' s a reason why
* i carry on when i lose the fight
* i want to give what you' re giving me
* always
* because you live and breathe
* because you make me believe in myself
* when nobody else can help
* because you live , girl
* my world
* has everything i need to survive
* because you live
* i live
* i live
