ye intruders beware .
crushing death and grief . . .
. . . soaked with blood of the trespassing thief .
this map is old news .
everybody went looking for that when our parents were our age .
haven' t you heard of him ?
what' s his name ?
the pirate guy .
one eyed willy .
one eyed willy ?
one eyed willy !
the most famous pirate in his time .
my dad told me all about him .
dad' il do anything to put you to sleep .
no !
see , one eyed willy stole a treasure once .
and it was full of rubies and emeralds
and diamonds ?
and diamonds .
then he loaded it onto his ship . . . . . . and sailed away into the sunset .
until the british king found out about it . . . . . . and sent out his whole armada to go after him .
it took them a couple of weeks to catch up with willy .
then there was a whole big war . . . . . . between the armada and willy' s ship , the inferno .
during the firefight , there were . . . . . . guns and cannons bursting here and there .
then willy fled , because he knew he' d get killed if he stayed around .
and then he got into this cave . . . . . . and the british blew up the walls around him .
he got caved in , and he' s been there ever since .
forever ?
forever .
and ever ?
trapped .
wow !
you sound as corny as dad does .
my dad tells the truth .
know what he said ?
he said one eyed willy and his bunch were down there for years .
they were digging tunnels and caves .
setting booty traps .
booby traps .
setting booby traps so anybody who tried to get in would die .
then he killed all his men .
why ?
why kill all of them ?
so they wouldn' t get his treasure .
wait a minute .
lf he killed all his men , how did the map get out ?
my dad said one of the guys must have gotten out with the map .
i believe you .
i don' t believe you at all .
what did you break this time ?
hey , you guys , look at this .

chester copperpot , missing while in pursuit of local legend .
reclusive scavenger claims , ' i have the key . . . . . . to one eyed willy . '
wow , do you guys realize what we could do ?
nobody ever found nothing .
why would this map be in this attic . . . . . . when it could be in some safe deposit box , right ?
right . lf chester copperpot didn' t find it , how would we find it ?
but what if ?
you guys . . . . . . what if this map can lead to one eyed willy' s rich stuff ?

the only problem is the batteries don' t last so long .
there' s a light up ahead .
maybe we can get out that way .
let' s go .
i' m not afraid of the dark .
i like the dark .
i love it .
but i hate nature .
i hate nature !
wait a sec !
hold it !

i' m just a kid !
what' s the problem ?
mister , i need a ride .
my friends and i had a run in with disgusting people .
you might' ve heard of them , the fratellis .
we found their hideout .
could you take me to the sheriff ?
i can describe all three of them .
will you
what the hell ?
he' s only a kid .
can' t you handle a kid ?
does it work , guys ?
yeah !
i can' t see .
mouth , your father' s a plumber .
what are these pipes ?
these look like water pipes , guys .
gas pipes .
drainage .
maybe wait a minute .
shut up for a minute !
these pipes must lead to a building or something .
a foundation .
so maybe if we bang on them hard enough , if we make enough noise . . . .
how are you , duke ?
hey , gene , how are you ?
great .
reverse pressure !
daddy !
let' s  get out of
here !
like now !
go , go , go !
we start with the pudgy little fingers .
then the plump little hands .
then the fleshy arms .
now , tell me where your friends are .
ln the fireplace .
don' t lie to me !
honestly .
we found a map over at mikey' s dad' s place . . . . . . that said there was buried treasure under here .
don' t give us none of your bullshit stories , huh ?
spill your guts .
tell us everything .
everything ?
everything .
everything .
okay , i' il talk .
ln 3rd grade , i cheated on my history exam .
ln 4th grade , i stole my uncle' s toupee and glued it on my face . . . . . . when i played moses in my hebrew school play .
ln 5th grade , i knocked my sister down the stairs , and i blamed our dog .
i can' t see a thing .
what am i stepping on ?
oh , brother .
look , a lantern .
somebody must have been here before us .
maybe they' re still here .
i hope not .
look at these cigarettes .
ten minutes ago , troy was looking down my shirt .
who cares ?
it' s not wrong .
lf i' d been smart , he' d still be looking .
listen to her .
what' s wrong with her ?
andy , it' s okay .
data : ls she all right ?
i should' ve let him look at my body .
don' t i have a beautiful body ?
you' ve got a great body .
how many years do i have before i get fat ?
before my hair falls out ?
before i look like him ?
then my mom sent me to a summer camp for fat kids .
then , once during lunch , i got nuts and i pigged out . . . . . . and they kicked me out !
look at him .
don' t touch it , guys .
this is one of your tricks , right , one eyed willy ?
you must be really hiding something to go through all this trouble .
there' s nothing to worry about .
you don' t understand !
don' t be afraid .
he' s dead for sure .
i think he' s chester copperpot .
chester who ?
who ?
don' t you remember from the attic ?
the news article ?
the last guy to look for the rich stuff . . . . . . he went in , but he never came back out .
that was back in 1 935 .
oh , god . lf he didn' t make it out and he was an expert , what about us ?
how will we get out ?
don' t worry about it .
calm down .
you sure ?
i' m positive .
how will we get out ?
we can' t be sure it' s him .
i know it' s him .
i bet his l . d. is in his wallet .
mouth , get his wallet .
lou gehrig ?
you get it , mikey !
mikey , get it .
it is chester copperpot .
oh , god .
come on .
you see ?
i told you .
we' re gonna get killed too .
hey , look at this .
candles .
they' re gonna kill us .
we' re dead .
where are you going ?
i' m setting booty traps .
booby traps .
that' s what i said .
i' il set booby traps in case anyone follows us . . . . . . like the fratellis .
we' il hear them coming .
okay , hurry up .
good idea .
where you going ?
to set booty traps .
you mean booby traps .
that' s what i said .
booby traps !
god , these guys . . . .
look .
it looks like a skeleton of one eyed willy or something .

give me this thing .
oh , god !
there' s no way out of here .

freeze !
run , you guys , run !
holy shit !
man , that was close .
wait , listen .
sounds like somebody' s down there .
shut up and listen .
maybe it' s a way out .
or the fratellis .
or chunk got the police .
or one of willy' s booby traps .
god put that rock there for a purpose .
i' m not so sure you should move it or anything .
hello ?
bats !
save me !
they' re in my hair .
help !
rabies !
rabies !
rabies !
we' re gonna get rabies !
but the worst thing i ever done , i mixed up fake puke at home . . . . . . and i went to this movie theater , hid the puke in my jacket . . . . . . climbed up to the balcony . . . . . . and then i made a noise like this
and then i dumped it over the side . . . . . . on all the people in the audience .
then
then this was horrible .
all the people started getting sick and throwing up on each other .
i never felt so bad in my entire life .
i' m beginning to like him , ma .
hit puree .
no , i' m too young !
no !
i want to play the violin !
not my hand !
do i get the truth ?
do i get the truth , or do you get juiced ?
what was that noise ?
fireplace blew .
the kid' s not kidding , ma .
there' s a tunnel down there .
watch your hair !
they' re going for the hair !
watch your veins , ma !
hey , mikey , if you can hear me , run !
run !
they' re coming after you !
data : lf we keep going this far down , we' il reach china .
maybe i can go see my auntie or something .
this could get dangerous , andy .
you might want to hold my hand .

i don' t know .
probably a couple hundred years before president lincoln .
george washington .
martin sheen .
that' s president kennedy , you idiot !
well , same difference !
i mean , he played kennedy once .
that' s smart .
i' m glad you' re using your brain .
at least i have a brain !
you' re so stupid , mouth .
oh , yeah ?
yes .
shut up !
wait a minute .
wait a minute .
this isn' t gold .
this is a wishing well .
look .
it must be the old moss garden wishing well .
i used to believe when you threw money in , it turned into your wish .
i' il take two of your coins .
that' s not fair .
wait , wait , wait , you can' t do this .
why ?
because these are somebody else' s wishes .
they' re somebody else' s dreams .
yeah , but you know what ?
this one , this one right here . . . . . . this was my dream , my wish .
and it didn' t come true .
so i' m taking it back .
i' m taking them all back .
come on , one eyed willy , what does this have to do with the map ?
ls this another one of your tricks ?
maybe we should keep him alive in case he isn' t lying .
good idea , jake .
put him in with your brother .
okay , ma .
come on , kid .
you dropped something .
what' s that , a cracker jack prize ?
shit !
