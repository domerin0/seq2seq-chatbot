patricide is when you gun down your old man .

fratricide .

fratricide is when you gun down your brother .
you' re wrong , i' m right , so it' s my turn .
mama cass .
asphyxiation .
dumb broad died choking on a ham sandwich .
bzzzt .
wrong answer .
chicken sandwich ?
bzzzt .
wrong answer again !
who cares what kind of sandwich !
mama cass died of a heart attack .
urban legend , ham sandwich .
game over .
so how come you never told me you grew up on a farm ?
there' s not much to tell .
my mom took me away when i was a boy .
something about that farm we couldn' t agree on .
what ?
my father .
huh ?
150 bucks ?
are you crazy ?
hey , never criticise a man until you walked a mile in his shoes .
then you can criticise him , cos you' re a mile away and you got his fuckin ' shoes !
talking of which hey , carl , are we there yet ?
yo , lan .
like i know !
mac , any of this look familiar to you ?
vaguely ?
open the door , already !
daddy' s gotta pee !
oh , wow .
i' m ready to pick a little cotton for master , y' all .
got something against farm people ?
no .
besides the fact that they lynched my ancestors , smell like cow shit , have sex with their cousins , invented country music , and they have two first names , like bobby joe , billy jean .
god .
oh , man , my hay fever .
that is so nasty !
jesus !
takes them a full 30 seconds to realise they ain' t got a head .
chickens .
name' s billy bob .
glad you could make it .
fuck off .
note to self farming not a career option .
your pa' s waiting for you up at the house .
how did he know i' d come ?
it' s a real pity about your aunt .
yeah .
thanks .
yo , where you going with the homecoming queen , son ?
i' d watch my step if i were you , boy .
oh , yeah ?
why' s that ?
cos you' re standing in horse shit .
oh , fuck off , god damn it !
all over my brand new kegs , goddamn !
hey , candy , go get me a kleenex or somethin ' .
fuck all y' all , bastards .
none of your parents were married , you bitches .
perfect .
no signal .
you need a wider lens for that .
ah , you' re jealous .
dream on .
hold it right there .
don' t move !
now turn around slowly , boy .
you got a lot of nerve , intruding on a man' s grief .
i bet i could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide .
now , who are you ?
you know who i am , you invited me .
i' m your son , lorene' s son .
ain' t nobody mentioned that name on this farm in fifteen years .
my boy was taken from me .
far as i' m concerned he' s dead .
now i' m not gonna ask you again who are you ?
i' m joseph macdonald .
joseph macdonald .
that' s right , boy .
and don' t you ever forget it .
i was just yanking your chain .
well , come here , boy .
come on .
how ' bout a hug ?
oh , look at you !
you' re the spitting image of your grandpa !
god rest his soul , if he could only see you now !
i' m just here for the funeral .
that' s all .
she ... just broke her heart that you never visited .
but i always said you' d come back .
i' il be gone again tomorrow .
guess it' s her time to go .
can' t argue when the good lord calls you home .
how was she called ?
pardon ?
aunt edith , h how did she die ?
natural causes .
lord , bestow your blessing on this worthless band of sinners .
to everything there is a season
and a time to every purpose under the heaven .
a time to be born and a time to die .
a time to plant and a time to reap .
a time to kill and a time to heal .
shit , i hope my funeral has a bigger turnout .
a time to keep silence and a time to speak .
" a time of war and a time of peace ...
the devil has returned .
pardon me ?
jethro , you look just like him .
you' re not welcome here , jesse .
i' ve come to warn them .
i want you off my land .
keep reading , reverend .
a time to love and a time to hate .
it' s started again , the harvest of blood .
i know , i can feel it .
your father' s legacy of evil .
my daddy' s dead .
you and the others took care of that .
yes , and burning for his sins !
a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing .
you will join him in hell !
get out of here , or so help me god !
holy shit !
jeremiah , no !
jeremiah !
no !
the sins of the fathers
shall be visited upon the children' s children !
and the sword ...
shall be made drunk with their blood .
i commit edith macdonald to the blessed soil of the land she loved and cherished .
amen .
thanks for coming , gene .
sorry about what happened .
i just got upset and i guess i got carried away .
no problem .
do me a favour , keep an eye on those kids .
we don' t want no pot smoking musicians spoiling things around here .
don' t worry , it' s all under control .
you working on any cases ?
no , it' s dead quiet .
don' t fear the reaper !
now say you' re sorry !
i' m sorry !
jesus !
you motherfucker !
so , what' s for dinner ?
best moonshine in the county .
i make it myself .
edith used to say , the two toughest things to swallow are pride and moonshine .
i can think of a third .
so , um , how do you make this stuff ?
well , i could tell you .
but then i' d have to cut your throat and gut you like a pig .
just yanking your chain .
old family secret .
some things are better kept that way , right , son ?
je ...
sir , this is a truly wonderful meal .
thank you .
to edith .
to edith .
may she rest in peace .
and to my son .
the last of the macdonalds who' s finally been called home .
to me .
to mac !
and ...
the farm !
good , little lady !
the farm !
to old macdonald' s farm !
are you ok ?
yeah .
excuse me .
mac , man , what did i say ?
i was just kinda goofing around .
you just reminded him of jethro .
who' s jethro ?
jethro macdonald .
my grandfather .
scared most people in this county half to death .
kids used to call him crazy old macdonald .
he' s not still around , is he ?
er , died about 14 years ago in a fire .
burned to death .
holy smoke .
so what did he do that scared people ?
er ...
why don' t you ask mac ?
it' s his granddaddy .
i don' t remember .
was he some kind of axe murderer ?
why don' t you ask him yourself ?
he' s sitting right behind you , on the mantel .
my daddy ... was a man of vision .
people always fear what they don' t understand .
he lived for this land ... and he died for it .
rest in peace , daddy .
i was just yanking your chains .
jethro' s buried up on the hill with the rest of the family .
that old barn , after the fire i rebuilt it nail by nail , just like your granddaddy would have wanted .
why did you put me up here ?
this used to be his room .
you ain' t afraid of ghosts , are you ?
should i be ?
thought you might want these .
just so you know , after your mama took you away , i did write to you .
she sent every one of them back .
i' m not the monster you think i am .
tell that to the lady you almost killed with a shovel .
jesse ?
don' t pay her no mind , she' s just crazy .
you could have killed her .
i lost my temper and i' m sorry , ok ?
jesse hasn' t been right in her mind since her husband passed away .
wasn' t much right before that , neither .
she was talking about a harvest of blood .
old slave superstition .
sprinkle a little blood on the crops , get a better harvest .
blood ?
chicken blood .
don' t you worry about jesse .
you get some sleep .
i' il see you in the morning .
man !
wonder why a brother' s gotta sleep on the couch ?
when i' m famous , i' m gonna forget all these motherfuckers .
what the fuck is ... ?
mmm .
i could get used to life on a farm .
oh , no , not again .
mm hm .
you only live once !
man , that must have been the weirdest funeral i' ve ever seen .
if you ask me , old macdonald belongs on a funny farm .
that' s funny .
what' s wrong ?
i don' t know .
this used to be jethro' s room the attic .
you' re kidding .
really ?
i wasn' t allowed in here when i was a kid .
that turns me on even more .
oh , yeah ?
think of it as a threesome .
you , me and jethro .
what ?
i don' t know .
fine .
forget it then .
no .
come on , man .
... chicken .
come on , baby .
it' s a farm , keith .
you' re not supposed to shoot the rooster .
he started it .
where is mac ?
his bed hasn' t been slept in .
what ?
you mean i slept on that fucking couch for nothing ?
i guess so .
see , that' s not cool .
yeah , fucker , i got you now , bitch .
what the hell are you doing out here ?
we' re almost ready .
oh .
i , er , i heard something .
i came down here last night .
i must have fallen asleep .
where is everybody ?
getting ready .
and keith' s about to use the rooster for target practice .
what' s wrong ?
nothing .
wanna talk about it ?
you didn' t seem too interested last night .
it' s strange .
i feel my old self coming back .
so can i.
morning , jeremiah .
morning .
well , better get a move on .
i won' t be able to guarantee the safety of that macdonald cock much longer .
women .
can' t live with them , can' t shoot them without good cause .
all right , bubba .
good luck on that reading thing .
all right .
cool .
that' s fine .
gonna miss you , boy .
you gonna miss my ass , bubba gump .
let me guess .
we' re going on a long trip .
not according to these .
well ...

i can' t believe this shit .
candy , get your ass off the bus .
go ahead , sweetie .

you don' t know what' s wrong , but i know what' s right .
get some help .
be serious .
i' m serious !
better get to steppin ' !

punk ass !
you think we can push it ?
your herculean ass can push it .

i wouldn' t be out here if it wasn' t for your dead ass auntie .
somebody get her some water .
hey !
woo hoo !
long time no see .
ok , everybody .
listen up .
i just talked to orwell down at the garage .
she says getting an injector pump for your bus shouldn' t be a problem .
could take a little while , though .
wait a minute , what' s a little while ?
oh , two , maybe three days .
what ?
i' m stuck here in redneck river valley without a ride ?
the lord works in mysterious ways .
i have to get back to my job !
someone employs her ?
i happen to be a professional .
which street corner ?
hey !
hey .
she' s a ... um ...
tarot card reader .
yeah .
in a shopping mall , ok ?
what about our showcase ?
yeah .
if you' re looking to practise , you can set up in the barn .
ok , everybody , shift your pretty little asses .
we' re moving the bus .
as long as you' re staying , you mind giving me a hand ?
carl , go help my dad .
actually , i was talking to you .
i could use your help .
so ... just the two of us .
save it , ass wipe .
get the shit in the barn .
ok .
$100 says you can' t hit one .
my mama says i can hit all three .
watch .
who da man !
bring it on !
it' s the sights , man .
the sights are off .
you want me to move them a little closer for you ?
you think you can do better , bobby joe or whatever your name is ?
go ahead .
bring your country ass up here .
there you go .
step up to the mike , go ahead .
woo hoo hoo !
yeah !
wow .
that' s nice .
i prefer a shotgun myself .
comes in much more handy on a farm .
but i guess your kind wouldn' t know too much about that .
my kind ?
what do you mean , black people ?
musicians .
that' s what i thought .
feels good , don' t it ?
yeah .
land a man' s born on it , a man' s buried on it .
in between , you just gotta do what you gotta do to take care of it .
just what i said this farm needs .
a little new blood .
ergh !
yah !
i like that .
hold it .
aren' t you forgetting something , rod ?
like what ?
your guitar break ?
it' s right after the third verse .
second verse .
what' s the difference ?
second verse , third verse ?
it' s rock' n' roll , it isn' t carved in stone .
what' s the difference ?
you' re screwing up the song .
i' m screwing up the song ?
you' ve been two beats behind since we kicked it off .
fuck you , man !
what are you talking about ?
he' s right .
you were behind .
next you' re gonna tell me i ain' t got no rhythm .
yo , billy bob , was i two beats behind ?
nope .
see ?
you figure it out .
i gotta take a break .
what ?
so you gotta feed the cows and the chickens ?
excuse me .
you were a beat and a quarter behind .
i' m getting musical notes from sling blade ?
all right .
bring your banjo over here and show me what you can do .
i ain' t never played no banjo in my life before .
but ...
do you mind ?
no , do your thing .
i don' t sing but i do play a little organ in church on sundays .
you wanna tell me what' s going on ?
you wouldn' t understand .
really .
now we have a communication problem .
whatever .
if you wanna bail on me , that' s fine .
but not the band , we' ve worked too fucking hard .
the sooner we get off this farm , the better .
ow .
fucking shit .

fucking cock sucking son of a fucking ...
ow , ow , ow .

i did not come here to kick it with the cows and the fucking roosters , mac , drink moonshine with johnny fucking cash , junior and senior .
is that right ?
yes , that' s right .
you can kiss my city ass goodbye cos i don' t ever wanna see you again .
you' re just as crazy as the rest of ' em , macdonald .
now you' re talking about my family .
you know what , man ?
i always thought i was your family .
i don' t even know you any more , man .
go ahead , shoot me .
you can' t leave .
you can' t take billy bob' s bike .

keith !
well , there goes our record deal .

you should have asked the wizard for some brains , asshole .
oh , yeah ?
fuck !
oh , fuck !
fuck you !
you any good with those ?
shuffle .
hm .
you have a strong , unfulfilled desire .
yeah .
to get the hell off this farm .
no .
this is something spiritual .
an ambition .
the band ?
me ?
hm .
the ten of swords .
so let me get this straight .
we' re talking about manure .
the ancient aztecs knew how powerful this stuff really is .
cow shit .
are you sure the aztecs even had cows ?
manure is the very essence of what we eat and who we are .
matter of fact , you' re even smoking some of it right now .
are you crazy ?
no , man .
i sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before i rolled it .
aha !
the lovers .
not lately .
that' s the opposing card .
what lies ahead , you' il have to confront .
the devil .
so what is this thing ?
this , my friend ...
this is the most vicious farm machine known to man .
a thresher .
so what does it do ?
it threshes .
look at these blades .
go ahead , feel for yourself .
you' re full of shit .
fuck !
fuck .
you boys all right ?
what the hell are you doing ?
my job .
i always move the thresher to the south field before sunrise .
you could have killed us .
didn' t see you there .
god damn it , what is that smell ?
smells like , um ...
manure .
come on , let' s get back to the house .
asshole .
gene .
jeremiah .
missed you at church this morning .
ain' t gonna arrest me for it , are you ?
hell , no .
but you missed a good sermon .
can' t hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the lord .
sounds familiar .
book of jeremiah .
you here on official business ?
sure am .
couple of kids disappeared last week on their way to a concert .
parents think something might have happened .
take a look .
maybe you seen them before .
oh , yeah .
these two .
buried ' em myself , over near the cornfield last week .
i' m just yanking your chain .
never saw ' em before in my life .
you know kids .
probably smashed up daddy' s car and too afraid to go home .
yeah .
could be .
thought they were only staying the night .
bus broke down .
where' s the black fella ?
he got axed from the band .
huh .
listen , i got a little surprise for you , if you' re interested .
hop in .
should we be here , dude ?
metaphysical question , man .
you gotta bring that daughter of yours round more often .
yeah , i' il do that .
you know , one of these days i' il have to shut down that still of yours .
yeah ?
well , why don' t you keep these as evidence in the meantime ?
take care .
you bet , gene .
bring that girl .
damn , that' s good !
carl ?
hey .
hey .
so , do you wanna tell me what' s with all the cloak and dagger shit ?
there' s something weird going on here , suzie .
no kidding .
i' m serious .
listen to me .
i had a good look at that injector pump and it' s clearly been messed with .
wear and tear didn' t cause that breakdown .
you' re saying someone' s trying to keep us on the farm ?
not someone mac .
why would he do that ?
he' s been acting so weird .
he doesn' t want us to leave .
suzie , face it .
the only axe he' s picked up since he got here is a real one .
he doesn' t give a damn about the band any more , or about you .
you deserve better .
you know ?
thanks , carl .
i never told you this but when i watch you ... up on stage , performing , something happens to me .
something ...
sorry .
damn it , carl , you' re taping me again ?
what is with you ?
you fucking ... oh .
freak !
suzie , wait !
i didn' t even know it was on .
suzie , wait .
oh , man .
note to self asshole .
an axe !
wait a minute .
what' s that ?
do you hear that ?
hey , suze !
where have you guys been ?
us ?
we' ve been moonlighting .
moonshining .
harvest moonshining !
so where' s mac ?
who knows ?
just like a man , never around when you need him .
we' re here .
huh ?
... and at that point , she went down on me .
uh !
shit .
carl , probably playing with himself .
my solo definitely sounds better in the second verse .
he' s right .
nice guitar break .
he should turn that down .
jeremiah' s gonna kill him .
wooo !
woo !
hey , carl , turn the music down !
thank you !
i can' t believe this .
what the fuck happened here ?
someone had a little party .
a party ?
jesus !
somebody jimi hendrixed my axe !
i guess it was carl .
what ?
carl did this ?
last night .
he tried to get it on with me and ...
and this is how he deals with it .
trashing our stuff !
if i find him , he' s a dead man .
damn right you are .
you gotta tell mac .
why bother ?
come to pick out a plot for yourself ?
most people say jethro shouldn' t have been buried up here , with the rest of the macdonalds .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
hell , he' s your granddaddy .
you know what he did .
or maybe you don' t .
or maybe you just don' t wanna remember .
why do you think your mama took you away from this place ?
what do you know about the harvest of blood ?
it was chicken blood on the crops .
chicken blood ?
who told you it was chicken blood ?
sheriff says a couple of kids are missing .
no one' s seen jesse for days .
you ask me , someone' s carrying on that old macdonald tradition .
harvest should be pretty good soon .
wait a second .
carl ?
oh , my god !
it' s time we had a talk about my grandfather .
this irrigation system , your granddaddy built it himself , saved this land from dying .
i don' t give a fuck about that , i want to talk about him .
ok .
what do you wanna know ?
what you' ve been avoiding .
avoiding ?
i keep hearing he killed people .
i know what people say .
rumours .
thick as buttermilk round these parts .
you should know that .
could you hand me the monkey wrench ?
candy , i think i' ve got it .
whoa !
can you hand me that flashlight ?
bad vibes .
suzie !
suze ?
suze ?
this is fucked !
they' re dead .
what' s going on ?
that basement hasn' t been used in years .
slaves hid there before the civil war .
we' d better get the sheriff .
sheriff ?
we don' t need a sunday school lesson .
we need to get out of here !
calm down .
we all know what' s going on .
it' s him .
case closed .
whoa .
are you saying that i did this ?
are you saying i killed your friends ?
killed them ?
bled them like sheep .
if i wanted you dead , i' d kill you right now .
well , then who ?
huh ?
it' s like jesse said .
the killings have started again .
someone' s picking up where jethro left off .
you' re talking about your granddaddy , boy .
billy bob says there' s gonna be a good harvest .
he' s talking about a harvest of blood , isn' t he ?
where is billy bob ?
nobody' s here , let' s go .
oh , my god .
it' s keith' s .
it gets worse .
he' s cut the phone line .
let' s get out of here .
looks like billy bob' s been busy .
dude !
dude , give it up .
somebody cut the wires .
there' s a phone at the next farm .
it' s about a 20 minute walk on the road but if we cut through the field , it' s a lot quicker .
after you .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
jeremiah .
what the hell is that ?
run !
get back to the barn .
run !
fuck you !
no !
sh ... sh ...
hey .
hey !

candy , come on !
