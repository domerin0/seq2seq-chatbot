ar mo
ar mo
this is the detention centre ... of the fushun bureau of public security ... and i am the governer
during the war ... this was a japanese prison
many of you may remember it ... because you worked with the japanese
you were responsible for building it ... and you filled it with innocent people
how could this happen ?
why did you betray your country ?
what turned you into war criminals ?
we believe ... that men are born good
we believe ... that the only way to change ... is to discover the truth and look at it in the face
that is why you are here
you will begin by writing the story of your lives ... and by confessing your crimes
your salvation will lie entirely ... in the attitude you take
i advise you to be frank and sincere
otherwise things can still go very badly for you
twllightln the forbldden clty
after a few years the chinese republic ... had become as corrupt as the old empire
it fell quickly into the hands of ambitious generals and corrupt bureaucrats
the era of the warlords had begun
by may 1919 when i had received my appointment ...
china was in turmoil
may the new tutor present himself
your lmperial highness ... the new tutor
mr reginald fleming johnston
how do you do , mr johnston ?
how do you do , your majesty
now we will go to school
your majesty ... in my country it would be usual to begin ... with some kind of an examination
the emperor cannot be examined
now that my have to change
but first your majesty might like to ask me some questions ?
where are your ancestors buried ?
in scotland , your majesty
but then where' s your skirt ?
in your country men wear short skirts , do they not ?
no , your majesty , scotsmen do not wear skirts ... " they wear kilts
kilts ?
a matter of words perhaps but words are important
why are words important ?
if you cannot say what you mean , your majesty ... " you will never mean what you say
and a gentleman should always mean what he says
ah yes !
a gentleman
are you a gentleman ?
i would like to be a gentleman , your majesty
i try to be
i am not a gentleman
i' m not allowed to say what i mean
they are always telling me what to say
your majesty is still very young
i thought he might like to see some english and american magazines
i have just received them
i know that you know ... that i know that you know ... that that is a dialogue between confucious ... and chuang tsu
concerning respect , your majesty
who is this george washington ?
a famous american , your majesty
a revolutionary general , the first american president
ah , like mr lenin in russia ?
not quiet
does he have a car ?
he lived a long time ago , your majesty
i want a car
i think your mouse is trying to escape , your majesty
please do not tell anyone about my mouse
the lesson is finished
our official taster is a brave man
many of my ancestors have been poisoned , you know
does your majesty have lunch like this every day ?
oh , yes , every day .
like theatre
i do not know why .
it has always been like that
how do they kill emperor' s in the west ?
the austrian emperor was shot , was he not ?
but this nephew was assassinated before the great war
but the russian emperor has been shot
he was called the tsar
he took lots of our land in manchuria
i' m a manchurian
even after the republic , it' s still my country
the , er ... secret , your majesty , is emerging again
something is happening
what is happening , mr johnston ?
nothing is quiet
on our way here , your majesty ... " we were held up by students from a university
they were protesting against the republican government ... because it has agreed to give away chinese territory ... to japan
is it true , mr johnston ... " that many people out there have had their heads chopped off ?
it is true , your majesty ... " many heads have been chopped off
it does stop them thinking
it is time for the emperor' s rest
the students are right to be angry
i am angry
but i' m not allowed to leave the forbidden city
i want to go out , mr johnston
my lord , i want to see the city of sounds
the emperor awards you ... with the order of the ruby hat button ... and with the right to be carried in your own chair with four bearers
i hope the emperor has not forgotten ... that this is the day for his maths class
for your majesty
my doctor said bicycles are bad for you
bad for you , nonsense
how does it work ?
oh ... it' s simple
head up and eyes forward as in life
my mother' s dead , is she not ?
yes , your majesty .
i' m profoundly sorry
i' m not
she killed herself
she swallowed a ball of opium
i' m going to see her , and my brother
open the door
open the door !
open the door !
look where you lead him
and you are an old , cruel , ignorant man
the boy' s mother is dead and he' s not even allowed to see her
i want to go out !
i want to go out !
stop it .
stay where you are
i want to go out
stop it !
stay where you are
i want to go out !
hunchback .
big foot
give me your hand , sir
give me your hand , sir
look at my left ear please , sir
and now my right
would you follow my finger please , sir
well , it' s perfectly simple johnstone
the emperor needs spectacles
like harold lloyd
impossible
an emperor does not wear spectacles
that cannot be allowed
times have changed , your highnesses
if his majesty doesn' t get spectacles , johnston ... " he could lose his sight
if the emperor does not get spectacles , i will resign
unfortunately , our decision is final ... " and unfortunately what i have to say ... will be published in every newspaper in china
what do you have to say , mr johnston ?
the emperor has been a prisoner in his own palace ... since the day that he was crowned ... and has remained a prisoner since he abdicated
but , now he' s growing up ... he may wonder why he' s the only person in china " who may not walk out of his own front door
i think the emperor is the loneliest boy on earth
it would be conveniently sad ... if he becomes blind
blind ... mr johnston ?
to the expense , your excellency
to the cost of maintaining one thousand two hundred eunuchs ... three hundred and fifty ladies in waiting ... and one hundred and eighty five cooks
to buying one hundred and twenty sable furs a month ... and three thousand chickens a week
to the fact that eight hundred and forty guards and employees ... of the household department plus one lord chamberlain ... care only about one thing ... filling their own rice bowls
you are very good at accounts , mr johnston
the emperor may have abdicated ... but he is still a symbol of great importance ... to many people
if i did not agree with that i would not be here
and some of us believe ... that one day soon he may be more than a symbol
the spectacles are a detail
what do you really want , mr johnston ?
just the spectacles
oh no ... the princess wan jung , your majesty
seventeen years old
princess who jen , fifteen years old
the princess li li , your majesty
and the princess fun ying
who is this ?
princess wen hsiu , twelve years old
she has got a funny face
not just one wife
one empress and one secondary consort
two wives
but , who did you choose to be the empress ?
they chose her , she' s very old , johnston
she' s seventeen
that' s not so old , your majesty
what does she look like ?
old fashioned
i want a modern wife , johnston
who speaks english and french
and who can dance the quickstep
johnston
i' m going to escape , johnston
i' ve got a suitcase and a ticket to english
i' m going to oxford university
your majesty ... if you get married ... you will become the master of your own house
a wedding might be a more practical way to escape
why did you never get married , johnston ?
the secondary consort welcomes the empress
the empress greets the secondary consort
you are doing everything every well
thank you .
i rehearsed many times
what is his majesty thinking ?
i was thinking if i was a real emperor ...
i would become the ruler of china now
and what would the emperor do ... if he could really rule ?
i would change everything
even the way we get married
is the emperor against arranged marriages ?
it is humiliating not to choose whom you marry
even i was not allowed to choose
in another year or two ...
his majesty will be taller than me
is it true the emperor has a suitcase under his bed ... and is going to oxford
will the emperor take wan jung with him ?
perhaps he would like to see my face before he decides
the emperor would like to see the face of the empress
it is the emperor who must remove the kai t' ou
i also had a tutor ... like mr johnston
miss windsor
she' s american
miss windsor taught me how to do the dance of the quickstep
does the emperor know how to do the quickstep ?
will you teach me ?
leave us , leave us
if your majesty thinks ... it is old fashioned ... to make the rain and the wind with a stranger ... we can be like a modern couple ... to begin with
a modern couple ?
goodnight !
goodnight !
you must come to oxford with me
i like him
i am sure i am going to like him
and he will grow up
eyes down
report your arrival
prisoner 981 reporting
louder !
prisoner 981 reporting !
open the door
close the door
sit down
name ?
aisin gioro pu yi
write it
now then ... there are two types of confession
we call them toothpaste ... and water tap
the toothpaste prisoner needs to be squeezed every now and then ... or else he forgets to keep confessing
the water tap man ... needs one good hard twist before he starts ... but then everything comes out
now ... you' re an intelligent person
i' m sure you understand me ?
good .
then we' il begin
why do you think you' re in here 981 ?
i am accused of being a traitor ... a collaborator and a counter revolutionary
it is not an accusation !
you are a traitor !
you are a collaborator and you are a counter revolutionary
did you write this ?
and you call it a confession ?
this is nothing but a list of dates
a child' s fairy tale
what do you want me to confess ?
you know what you did ... and what others did
so why don' t you volunteer the information ?
i do not understand
we don' t tell people what to confess
we already know everything about you
i ...
i wanted reforms
what did you want to ... reform ?
everything
cut off my queue
your majesty , please
it is heavy
the emperor before me was murdered ... because he wanted to reform the empire
is that no so , mr johnston ?
yes , your majesty ... probably
well ... let' s see if they will kill me for reforming the forbidden city
i am appointing mr johnston' s friend ... the poet and scholar chen hsiao hsiu ... to be the new lord chamberlain
i want him to supervise a detailed inventory ... of the lmperial storerooms
so that we can learn exactly how much has been stolen
