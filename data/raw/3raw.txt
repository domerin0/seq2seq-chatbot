i' m not supposed to tell you , but lorna' s pregnant .
what' d you say ?
you' il be a father !
she was afraid to tell you .
she was afraid you' d get angry .
you never talked about children ?
shit !
a baby .
there' s something i' m not supposed to tell you too .
rianne' s pregnant .
you' re going to be a grandfather .
rianne' s what ? !
rianne can' t be pregnant .
she' s not married .
i don' t think she intended to get that way .
they asking me to be a granddaddy ?
here' s what we' il do .
take your clothes off !
what for ?
okay , you run .
flame o sees you in your undies .
it distracts him , then i shoot .
shoot what ?
the valve on that napalm tank !
before he shoots me ?
maybe .
maybe ? !
is he black ?
too much armor on .
i can' t tell !
no !

the father of the baby !
please let him be black !
get going !
here he comes !
are those hearts ?
not now , riggs .

why ?
it' il distract him more .
i need him to turn .

we always go on 3 .
no time for 3 .
2 !
what about 1 ?

1 , 2 , go !
i don' t want to die in my underwear !

riggs , you think that bird thing helped ?
i just wanted to see if you' d do it .

you' re ashamed of your butt ?
he' s a lively one .
that shark hurts my boat , i take it out on you , leo .
i didn' t mean to catch it .
why do you want to keep it ?
yeah , why keep a shark ?
the teeth' il look great on a wall .
they got to stop snapping first .
maybe he' il fall asleep .
converse with him .
he' il nod off .
he don' t look tired .
chewing on leo will wear him out .
sharks eat their own kind ?
stop it !
i' m in stitches !
okay , where' s my bag ?
starboard side aft .
starboard , that' s left , right ?
no , port' s left .
starboard' s right .
right , yeah .
right side aft .

whatever .
check both sides .
careful !
he' s behind you , shark !
maybe we should throw him overboard .
throw them both overboard .
no witnesses .
we' d probably get away with it .
you too ?
i kept my nose out of it ... ... but you and lorna .
you' re having a baby , you' re living together .
you' re not marrying .
why , does that violate your family values system ?
i' m just trying to understand .
rianne' s not married either .
that' s hitting below the belt .
you know , when i was married ... ... it was good .
you know .
you put the ring on .
you make the commitment .
you do all the ....
she' s dead because i' m a cop .
she' s dead because i' m a cop and i ...
i don' t wear the ring anymore ... ... but i look , and it' s still there .
i still feel it .
it' s like i' m not finished with that yet .
i can' t explain it .
is that bullshit ?
no .
it' s not finished .
it' s not finished .
okay , you did say " aft " ?
a f t. aft !
that' s a fucking word ?
in the back on the right side , leo !
why didn' t you say that to begin with , roger ? !
people get around boats and water , everything becomes nautical !
astern !
avast , you landlubbers !
man the bilge pump !
pump your fucking ass !
all right , all right !
no problem , no problem !
what' s lorna say about it ?
she doesn' t like nautical terms either .
we haven' t discussed it .
that' s pretty messed up .
the baby' s due in days and you haven' t talked about marrying ?
no .
i haven' t done it at all .
do we want leo to shoot the shark ?
i want leo to shoot ...
no , leo !

coast guard interdicts about one a month .
pretty raggedy looking .
six weeks locked in a hole with one toilet .
rice and some fish to eat .
lousy deal for 35 grand a head .
where' d they get that kind of money ?
didn' t .
got to work it off from the snakeheads , the smugglers .
they sell them as cheap labor .
sell them ?
like slaves .
these must be the lucky ones .
they' il claim asylum .
say they were persecuted , like everybody else .
we' il send them packing .
cost you and me a fortune .
what happened to , " bring me your tired , your poor ... ... your wretched masses , yearning to be free " ?
now it reads , " no vacancies .
i guess your parents were native americans .
they pop one every boatload .
shows the rest what' il happen if they run off .
he' s nobody' s slave now .
don' t coddle them , move them !
i see this barrel coming down .
murtaugh didn' t see it , so i push him .
i knock him over .
we' re in the water .
i pull because he can' t swim .
i got to save him .
there' s that kid .
what' s his name ?
bissel ?
it' s a food .

was he in the killing section ?
this guy' s been shot four times !
at close range , like he was executed !
he was executed .
by the crew .
people get killed left , right and center in this town !
now we import victims ?
gangbangers kill each other , no problem !
one of us gets shot , occupational hazard !
but just a normal guy ?

that ain' t right .
easy , biscuits .
you' il get an ulcer .

i figured you didn' t want that .
you want to get married ?

since when do you read this smut ?
it' s not smut , it' s ebony clark .
trish gave it to me .
every fiber in his being desired her .
he devoured her with his eyes .
can we try this thing on page 1 96 sometime ?
there' s a good one on 1 68 .
maybe later .
nothing comes between a pregnant lady and a meal .
have i ever " made your womanhood reach peaks ... ... to rival the himalayas " ?
foothills of malibu , maybe .
not even a teton ?
i don' t think so .
thanks .
i thought i' d at least rate the rockies .
you know i' m kidding .
you say that to make me feel better .
no , i don' t .
you know i' m playing .
i' ve been to plenty of mountaintops with you .
it' s just that i' m hungry .

i dropped by lnternal affairs yesterday .
how' s the rat squad ?
i picked up something good .
some cheese ?
i. a. got an anonymous tip .
the person said roger' s on the take .

i know !
it' s probably some jerk he put away .
but with new boats and putting 2 kids through college ... ... i thought you ought to know .
i actually tried to persuade him to take money .

i can' t hear that !
nothing !
i won' t say anything anymore .
i' m kidding .
that' s awful .
i' m kidding .

you know how roger is about his daughter dating cops .
he' d kill them .

rianne married one , her baby' s father .
she' s afraid to tell roger .
they met , fell in love .

does trish know ?
she knows .
she doesn' t know you know .
but trish knows .
who' s the lucky soon to be dead son in law ?

i' m telling you , nothing !
i won' t tell .
he' d shoot me just for being the messenger .
he' s my best friend .
it' d be wrong to mess with him .

will you sit down ?
we' re dinosaurs headed for extinction .
speak for yourself .
guys with guns and psychology degrees , like butters out there .
biter has a psychology degree ?
more like a psycho degree .
times have got to change .
i once got shot by a hot rodder with a zip gun .
that' s how far back i go .
you wanted to see us ?
some things don' t change .
here we go .
the department lost its insurance .
all the damage you' ve done , they can' t get a new one ... ... while you two still run around .
they can' t fire you either .
so , they' re promoting you .
lieutenant !
there' s no open lieutenant spots .
so the chief used his special privilege , making you captains .
better .
captain !
time was when this would send me over the falls .
i' m getting old .
what do we do now ?
captain shit !
hang out .
take long lunches .
yell , " riggs , murtaugh , i' m the captain .
chief' s shitting bricks !

the millennium' s upon us .
new people , new department .
dr. woods ?
captain riggs .
don' t run .
i' m in a rush .
i need to talk to you .
what is it this time ?
recurring dreams about flying dwarfs ?
or did you cook up something new ?
i' m sorry about all that .
i want your advice .
i was thinking of ...
thinking ?
marriage .
marriage ? !
the " m " word ?
does " confidentiality " mean anything ?
that' s funny .
you know what' d happen ?
we' d go in my office ... ... and you know what you' d tell me ?
you' d tell me something like , " doc ... ... i want to marry murtaugh .
or your mother .
or nelson mandela !
nelson mandela ? !
something to ridicule me , riggs .
something to get a rise out of me .
listen carefully !
i' m ... not ... stupid !
and my time is reserved ... ... for police officers with real needs and real problems .
have you got that ? !
have you ? !
ask me again ?
no .
and you know what ?
i don' t like you .
stephanie ?
i can' t go out with you .
i' m in a relationship .
i think you need to see someone .
you' il find someone to love you .
not in this department .
but stop bothering me !
you' re disgusting !
what' s the matter with you people ? !
what' s shaking ?
captain riggs .
captain murtaugh .
turn around and do that .
we' re captains .
heard you were up to your ass in chinese .
the taller ones come up to the navel .
big enough to kick your ass .
what can i do for you ?
one of the ship' s crew shot an illegal , apparently under orders ... ... and we' d dearly like to know who' s smuggling chinese .
we' re pretty sure the big boss is benny chan .
uncle benny ?
you know him ?
when he was running smack .
we never nailed him .
benny' s slippery .
where' s he hang out ?
he' s got a nightclub , some restaurants .
he operates mainly out on north broadway .
here' s the address .
hi , fellas .
there he is .
hey , burger !
summers .
butters .
what you got on the freighter homicide ?
i talked to some illegals .
they only knew the shooter by sight .
the boat' s registered under a dummy corporation out of lndonesia .
it' il be a rough one to crack , but we' il nail them .
you ever hear of benny chan ?
no .
what kind of bad man is he ?
real bad .
crime boss in chinatown .
if it' s dirty and chinese , benny' s doing it .
where do i find him ?
at this restaurant .
i' m hungry for chinese .
how about you ?
we' re going there anyway .
we' il drive you .
let me get my jacket .
not with him .
he' s doing good .
we might need backup .
spend time with him .
you might learn to love him .
like a son .
in law ... ... enforcement it pays to know your fellow officer .
sir , it' il be an honor to share egg rolls with you .
yeah , all right .
let' s go .
share ?
butters , it seems like you hate crime in a sort of personal way .
why do you say that , sir ?
last night i noticed you were more than slightly miffed .
wasn' t he , roger ?
any particular reason ?
about 1 50, 000 of them .
that' s how many bullets zinged my neighborhood growing up .
couldn' t go outside .
couldn' t go near a window .
lived and ate on the floor , slept and watched tv on the floor .
i didn' t learn to walk till i was 1 0 .
spent my formative years nose to nose with the family beagle .
when i work on a crime , i ain' t thinking about the crime .
i' m thinking about that floor and it pisses me off .
we supposed to meet leo somewhere ?
no , why ?
because he' s following us .
don' t look .
who' s leo ?
maybe it' s a coincidence .
what does he want ?
i don' t know .
let' s find out .
fucking asshole !
bite me !
whatever !
whatever !
jerk !
you looking for us ?
you saw me ?
yeah , we saw you .
what you doing , leo ?
i' m perfecting my tailing technique now that i' m a p. i.
he' s a private eyesore .
inconspicuous vehicle !
i like it .
riggs , who' s the perp ?
what' d you bust him for ?
i' m a perp ?
a brother in a police car is automatically a perp ?
look at my suit !
do i look like the crips ' accountant ?
look at this badge , bitch !
check out the gun .
put the gun down !
license !
registration !
urine sample !
i got a badge too !
german jews didn' t have it easy as kids !
so don' t think you' re the only one .
i knew you were a cop .
i was kidding .
i can smell a cop a mile away .
you saying i smell bad ?
don' t turn everything around !
you' re so touchy .
these guys' il tell you .
we got a history together .
maybe we' il work together someday !
i' m the bomb !
we' il work together when i open a cereal shop , you leprechaun !
i didn' t call you names , fuckface !
don' t start !
don' t fool around !
these guys' il tell you .
you' re double parked .
officer , i' m just talking with the detectives .
we don' t know this guy .

they' re kidding .

i wasn' t drinking !
they just said that .
blow your breath in my hand .
i can smell it already .
blow in my fucking ear !
you' re all mine .
you' re mine !
you promised to deliver the family .
they' re not at the detention center .
they must have escaped .
the uncle won' t finish until he sees them .
don' t worry , they' il turn up .
in hong kong , you' d already be dead .
where' s uncle benny ?
he' s not here .
is he in there ?
i' m sure he is .
this way .
yes , it' s a two way .
we have 3 people .

i had this pet frog , name was froggy .
he was my best friend in the world .
i didn' t have lots of friends .
in fact ... ... i had no friends .
i used to kiss the frog too .
i thought maybe ... ... it would turn into a princess since i was a boy .
and it could be ... ... my mother .
they told me that she left or something .
and my father was no bargain .
and so , just the frog ... ... froggy , was my friend .
i loved him and took him everywhere with me .
i was riding my bike one day ... ... he jumped out of the box ... ... and i ran him over with the back tire .
i killed him .
i was really heartbroken .
really .
he was my best friend , the only thing i ever loved .
and then i met you ... ... and roger .
you looked after me a lot more than you had to .
i' m terrible to you , leo .
