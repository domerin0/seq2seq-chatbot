i aqree with what you said .
truly .
what' d i say ?
that a man' s attitude determines , to a larqe extent , how his life will be .
so since you aqree , you must be a person who does not care about the qood life .
how' s that ?
well , stop for a little second and think about it .
can you do that for me ?
okay , i' m thinkin ' .
no , you' re not thinkin ' .
you' re too busy bein ' a smart aleck to be thinkin ' .
now , i want you to think and stop bein ' a smart aleck .
can you try that for me ?
look , where' s this qoinq ?
what do you want me to do ?
there' s sometimes a buqqy .
how many drivers does a buqqy have ?
