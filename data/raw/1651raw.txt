ladies and gentlemen , justice is blind ... ... but it can be heard .
and today , the truth will come out .
mr. quesada , would you state for the court ... ... the sequence of events leading up to the night of june 30 ?
i stopped off at josie' s bar after work .
i had a few drinks .
angela was there .
she was closing up .
she asked me if i wanted to stick around for some fun .
anything that happened after that was entirely consensual .
are you aware that perjury is a crime , mr. quesada ?
objection .
my client' s a respectable member of the community .
miss sutton has a history of drug ...
my client' s not on trial .
her testimony is suspect ...
nor is her testimony suspect .
gentlemen , that' s enough .
the truth is , mr. murdock , is that miss sutton ...
miss sutton enjoyed every minute of it .
mr. quesada , for your sake , i hope justice is found here today ... ... before justice finds you .
that' s not right .
another rapist back on the streets .
yeah ?
here' s what i don' t get .
how can a scumbag like quesada afford an attorney like hirsh ?
he can' t .
the kingpin' s gotta be footing the bill .
come on .
let' s go get drunk .
not tonight .
i got work to do .
right here .
hey .
what' s up ?
you gotta take that .
big neck , come on .
i can' t believe ...
what was her name ?
to the justice system , right ?
of course i beat it .
kingpin' s got my back , bro .
how you doing , sweetie ?
boss ?
what' s up ?
what' s up with that ?
is that guy for real ?
yeah , he' s for real .
what do you want ?
justice .
oh , god .
oh , god !
hi .
how you doing ?
didn' t you hear ?
i was acquitted .
not by me .
hey , that light at the end of the tunnel ?
guess what .
that' s not heaven .
i' il kill you !
i' il kill you !
that' s the c train .
i' il kill you !
oh , god !
hey , you can' t go past there .
call charlie .
right .
you' re wasting your time , urich .
there' s nothing to see here .
jose quesada .
and the rest of jose quesada .
whole lot of nothing , huh ?
keep running those stories ... ... and we' il end up with copycat vigilantes who' il get themselves killed .
are you here to confirm that daredevil is responsible for this , detective ?
come on , urich .
stop busting my ...
there is no proof that your so called daredevil was involved ... ... nor that he even exists .
got it ?
got it .
<i>can one man make a difference ? </ i>

forgive me , father , for i have sinned .
it' s been a week since ...
what are you playing at , matt ?
you didn' t come here for forgiveness .
you want permission , and i can' t give you that .
justice isn' t a sin , father .
no , but vengeance is .
you see it every day on the streets .
violence just begets more violence .
is that how you want to live your life ?
a lawyer during the day ... ... and then judge and jury at night .
is that what you want ?
somebody has to do something .
well , why you ?
because i can .
because i' m not afraid .
well , i' m afraid for you , matthew .
look , a man without fear is a man without hope .
may god have mercy on you , forgive you and grant you everlasting life .
amen .
i' m not too crazy about the outfit either .
eyewitnesses say quesada was singled out ... ... by the demonic vigilante known as the daredevil .
i don' t know why you read that .
there' s gotta be something to it .
like the alligators in the sewers ?
there are alligators in the sewers .
a friend in sanitation has seen them .
fine .
just drop it .
you should see this guy .
they got this picture .
they have a picture ?
it' s a drawing , an artist' s rendering .
it' s just ...
it' s grotesque .
i' d hate to see his therapy bills .
speaking of bills ... ... your client , mr. lee , made his first payment .
great .
you should be very happy .
yeah , it' s fantastic .
he paid in fluke .
fluke is a fish .
did you know that ?
i didn' t .
mr. lee is a good man and doesn' t have much money ... ... and he fishes on weekends .
i guess it' s ...
i salsa dance on weekends , but i don' t shake my ass to pay my phone bill .
will you pass the honey , please ?
we need better clients .
i' m tired of pro bono cases .
what is your problem with our clients ?
we have good , honorable clients .
what' s your idea of better ?
define " better .
what would be a better client ?
better means rich and guilty , okay ?
law school taught us to create a moral vacuum ... ... so you can represent people who aren' t innocent .
that was your best course , as i recall .
you don' t have a moral vacuum .
you are completely vacuum less .
what ?
what ?
where ?
where ?
where ?
front door .
not yet , soon .
now .
tell me .
you want the truth ?
absolutely .
she' s hideous .
i don' t know if it' s a fungus or some congenital birth defect ... ... but as your attorney in this matter , i advise you to take no further action .
i' m sorry .
excuse me .
sure .
i was looking for some honey .
could you help me out ?
right in front of you .
well , could you be a little bit more specific ?
what are you ... ?
blind ?
yeah .
i am so sorry .
that' s okay .
friend of yours ?
you know , i' ve never seen him before .
matt murdock .
nice to meet you , matt murdock .
nice to meet you .
i didn' t get your name .
i didn' t give it .
some people have no compassion for the handicapped .
apparently not .
where you going ?
i' m gonna file an appeal .
we have to be in court by noon .
12 : 00 , matt .
i' il be there .
what do you want ?
i just wanted to get your name .
i didn' t want trouble .
look ... ... i don' t like being followed .
so don' t .
wait a minute .
wait a minute .
wait a second .
take it easy .
i don' t like being touched .
why don' t you tell me what you do like , and we' il start there .
sure you' re blind ?
sure you don' t wanna tell me your name ?
you' re holding back .
yes .
don' t .
does every guy have to go through this to find out your name ?
try asking for my number .
fight !
fight !
fight !
fight !
stop hitting me .
okay .
my name' s elektra natchios .
what' s wrong , wesley ?
have you seen the papers today ?
somebody' s been talking .
somebody always does .
natchios , my dear , old friend .
i' m getting out , wilson .
i am out .
you think it' s funny ?
they' re writing about the kingpin .
they' re going back to the beginning .
well , i' m tired of looking over my shoulder .
i want to put that behind me .
i want you to buy me out .
i think you' il find it' s a very generous offer .
so , what do you say ?
how' s your daughter ?
you okay ?
i ...
i think i' il be okay .
i' m not gonna lie and say it doesn' t hurt .
where did you learn to fight like that ?
my father .
he had me study with a different sensei every year since i was 5 .
sounds like he wanted to turn you into some kind of a warrior .
no .
just not a victim .
watch your step .
thank you .
i didn' t even ...
wait .
how did you do that ?
how did you do the park ?
i don' t know , growing up in the kitchen , a blind kid .
you learn how to look out for yourself .
see that ?
he just ran that light .
i want you to create a paper trail , one that can be traced to natchios .
sir ?
the press want a kingpin .
so i' il give them a kingpin .
get me bullseye .
two out of three .
bloody irish piece of trash .
i said i was sorry .
what do you want ?
details .
you owe me that .
her name' s elektra natchios .
she sounds like a mexican appetizer .
it' s greek , genius .
her father' s nikolaos natchios .
the billionaire ?
yeah , see .
yes , the billionaire .
as your attorney , i advise you to marry her immediately .
i' il take it under consideration .
susie is my son larry' s daughter by his first marriage .
she eloped with this semi colored fellow from london .
what' s the word for that ?
mulatto .
just let' s say he had a little cream in his coffee .
but he did very well for himself on the internet .
but don' t ask me how .
no .
you know , they did get me a computer for christmas last year ... ... but i refuse .
i' m afraid it' s going to explode .
but who can afford to fly these days ?
but then my sister marjorie called and said she had these frequent flier miles ... ... and she couldn' t use them because of her sciatic nerve .
so i said ...
she' s sleeping .
can i get you anything before we land ?
more peanuts , please .
yo , taxi !
that' s over on seventh .
you don' t remember me ?
thanks , buddy .
how can you not remember the kingpin ?
no , no , no , no .
please !
no , please , no !
you remember me now ?
what are you , stupid ?
you think you could hold out on the kingpin ?
huh ?
get away from me !
stay out of hell' s kitchen .
this ain' t your neighborhood no more .
kitchen belongs to the kingpin now .
please .
please don' t hurt me .
i' m not the bad guy , kid .
i' m not the bad guy .
i' m not .
i have to call you back because he just came in .
morning .
your ears must have been burning .
why ?
this just came by messenger .
your invitation to the black & white ball at the grand .
plus one .
plus one ?
all right .
guess i gotta rent a tux .
wow .
they spent some serious money on this invitation .
i mean , you should feel it .
it' s engraved .
what time are you gonna pick me up ?
i' m not going .
what ?
are you crazy ?
that place is gonna be crawling with rich people .
people who pay legal fees with money , not with fish .
or with wheels of cheese .
or with sports supplies .
i' m gonna fill you in on a secret .
this place doesn' t look like a law office .
it looks like the set of <i>sanford and son</ i> .
i' m waiting for lamont to walk in .
then you go .
look at me , matt .
i' m a plus one .
plus ones don' t get anywhere alone .
they need somebody to bring them .
are you finished ?
we only have an hour to prepare for court .
what' s eating you ?
rough night .
well , you want to talk about it ?
no .
it' s about elektra , isn' t it ?
no .
natchios owns the grand hotel , and elektra' s the reason you were invited .
she' s out of my league , and i' d rather end it before it starts .
that' s gotta be some record .
you just completely bypass the relationship ... ... you went right into the breakup .
trying to save some time ?
what happens to that lie detector of yours when it detects your own bull ?
let' s really bury the needle , huh ?
swish .
look , matt , seriously , the ball' s in your court .
so does this mean you want a rematch ?
i knew i' d find you .
how did you know i wasn' t a mugger ?
muggers don' t usually wear rose oil or high heels .
at least this far from chelsea .
come here .
there' s something i wanna show you .
wait a second .
exactly how many women have you brought up here , anyway ?
you' re my first .
good answer .
i thought that was the right answer .
look at this .
it' s so beautiful .
i know .
this was my favorite view of the city when i was a kid .
i really wanted you to see this .
what' s this ?
that' s from my mother .
for good luck .
it' s beautiful .
it' s a good luck charm , huh ?
i could use one of those .
do they make them in braille ?
she gave it to me right before she died .
what happened ?
i should go .
no .
just wait .
no , i' m gonna go ...
wait , wait , wait .
it' s about to rain .
no , it' s not .
it is .
i' m telling you , it' s ...
the temperature dropped two or three degrees .
i can smell the moisture .
and when it rains , it' s like there' s a rooftop on the world .
each raindrop makes a sound the first time it falls on a surface .
just then , it' s like i ...
it' s like i can see again .
and i just wanna ...
i just wanna see you .
okay .
look , here it comes .
my god .
you are so beautiful .
hey , i' m gonna cut you up , man .
think kingpin didn' t want his money ?
what ?
that' s my car !
that' s my car !
matt , what' s wrong ?
police !
shut up !
matt ?
i' m sorry .
i have to go .
hey , come back here .
stay .
stay with me .
this is what i' m talking about .
aren' t you happy you listened to me ?
this is gonna be great for business .
thank you .
matt murdock .
ben urich , <i>new york post</ i> .
ben urich , nice to meet you .
you write articles about urban legends , right ?
well , yes , among other things .
settle something for us .
you know the alligators in the sewers ?
my partner ...
i followed that piece you wrote about the kingpin .
one man running all the crime in new york city sounds a little far fetched .
yeah , but , then again , so does a vigilante who thinks every day is halloween .
they gotta be huge by now , right , the alligators ?
it' s a myth .
look , i' d like you to give me a call ...
sorry .
cool color .
i wouldn' t know .
yeah , but do give me a call .
there' s something i' d like to talk to you about .
nice to meet you .
enjoy the party .
look at that .
wilson fisk is in the hizzey .
we may never get a chance like this again .
come on , let' s go .
we should talk about this .
mr. fisk .
hi .
it' s franklin nelson from nelson & murdock ...
hey , yeah , you wanna talk to mr. fisk , you make an appointment .
okay ?
wesley .
i know who you are .
you' re the blind lawyers from hell' s kitchen .
right .
actually , he' s the blind one .
i' m deaf .
give them a card , wesley .
i' m always on the lookout for new blood .
i' m sorry , mr. fisk .
my partner is a little overzealous .
we can' t represent you .
and why is that ?
yes , why is that , mr. murdock ?
because we only handle clients who are innocent .
innocent , " he said .
he' s pretty funny .
i' ve learned one thing in my years in this business .
what' s that ?
nobody' s innocent .
nobody .
have a great time at the party .
thank you .
i just ...
you know , matt , for one night , i just wish ...
i just ...
matt , i just wish i could give you my eyes for one night .
it' s like that ?
it' s like that .
you want me to take you up there , matt ?
matt ?
matt ?
now i found you .
that' s all that matters .
hi .
hello .
hello .
hello .
you look beautiful tonight .
do you mind ?
no , i just ...
sometimes it makes people uncomfortable .
that' s all .
not me .
but you should know ... ... that the only reason i got dressed up for this thing ... ... was that i wanted to look beautiful for you .
i wish you could see me tonight .
me too .
matt .
what' s wrong ?
it' s just ... ... good things don' t happen to me very often .
when they do , i get scared .
nothing bad is gonna happen .
promise .
doesn' t she look beautiful ?
i think she' s happy .
i haven' t seen her smile like that since before her mother was killed .
poor girl .
right in front of her eyes .
what , you have to bring that up now ?
history has a way of repeating itself .
what are you saying ?
just saying goodbye , old friend .
just saying goodbye .
something' s happening .
what is it ?
papa !
papa .
papa .
tell me where you' re going .
you wait .
i' m sorry .
what is going on ?
new york is not a safe place tonight .

i never miss .
drop something ?

hey , nick .
what do you want , urich ?
does all this make you happy ?
looks like you got your story .
you were right , father .
you were right .
i know how you feel .
you don' t know how i feel .
i want revenge .
revenge won' t make the pain go away .
