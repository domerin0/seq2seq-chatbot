what do you do , by the way ?
i' m in advertising .
advertising .

people tend to enjoy what they' re really good at .
besides your job , what else makes you miserable ?
i mean , what do you do for fun ?
i didn' t think so .

there you guys go .
i can help you .
see , i have a gift .
a special ability to help men with problems .
i don' t have problems .
now , see that , usually , is the first sign .
of what ?
denial .
denial ?
first of all , i think you work too much .
really ?
and what do you know about work ?
plenty .
you admitted you do nothing else and it doesn' t make you happy .
i admitted nothing .
i was silent .
no special interests , no pets .
you hate dogs .
busted .
actually i do have a pet , a fish .
a fish ?
doesn' t count .
cold blooded .
sorry .
no , you are a walking case study .
look at you .
you' re a workaholic at such an advanced stage ... ... that your intimacy skills have withered away to almost nothing .
left untreated ... ... you could become emotionally extinct .
out of sheer perverse curiosity ... ... how does a lunatic like you help a guy like me ?
you live in a box .
i could lift the lid ... ... let some light in .
wow , that' s deep .
i feel almost cured just hearing it .
well ... ... if you want my help ... ... it' il require a commitment on your part .
you have to live with me here for a month .
no more , no less ... ... and no work allowed .
you don' t even know me ... ... and you' re inviting me to move in ?
and how' s my girlfriend supposed to feel about that ?
girlfriend ?
you don' t have a girlfriend .
i mean , it' s something you feel .
there' s something intimate a woman leaves on a man that you don' t have .
her name' s angelica .
well , i feel sorry for angelica .
great .
i' il relay that to her when i leave .
which is ... right about now .
october' s almost over .
we can start midnight ... ... first of november .
if you' re brave enough to commit , i' il devote myself entirely to you .
brave enough , but not stupid enough .
now listen up , moonbeam .
here' s how it works .
no more harassment .
no more rides .
no more extortion .
next time you come into my building ... ... l really will call the cops .

we love our rituals .
our team hits a home run , we' re screaming .

but i knew one day you' d snap , and we' d all burn .

how many millions you lost ?
you just dragged my agency' s name through the gutter .
hold on a second .
gutter ?
i' m the best thing this agency' s got .

i was trying to introduce you .
that' s ai and osiris .

i have to break the record of 300 hours .
no .
loser .
get a life .
good one .
you let a 10 year old wind you up ?
forget him .
what about you ?
you sleep with half the city , get the whole neighborhood involved .
you' d prefer if i was a virgin ?
considering the alternative , yes .
i' m yours .
all yours .
look , sara , you' re great .
you' re a very sexy , smart , interesting , somewhat unusual woman .
but we i always think it' s best to clarify issues .
you are the most egotistical man i' ve ever met .
i am talking about a month .
the truth is , i don' t have a month .
time is money .
okay .
let' s just how long do you think ... ... you could put this big , lucrative career of yours on hold ?
just , just
god , what am i talking about ? !
you are unemployed !
you don' t have a job !
you got fired , nelson .
you have nothing to go back to .
this project of yours feels like an excuse to get laid .
sara , i' m sorry .
i ....
sara , i didn' t mean to i didn' t think you' d
i don' t understand why you' re doing this , is all .
i told you .
i have my reasons .
still friends ?
only if you give me what i want .
what ?
time .
all i can do is a day .
i' il take it .
okay .
i' il take it .
always a thrill to explore new career possibilities .
how much do you charge ?
i don' t do this for the money .
why do you do it ?
i like it .
you can take them off the leashes .
come on .
oh , yes , you' re so excited , i know .
yeah , you go raise some hell .
don' t tell your mom , okay ?
you can let them go , you know , nelson .
come on !
yippee .
come on .
let' s go .
come on !
get off me !
so when was the last time you spent a whole day outside ?
when my parents dragged me to alcatraz for the day at the age of 9 .
wow .
now you tell me something .
anything .
what was so enlightening about what we did today ?
why is letting some dogs go wild a better way to live than my way ?
granted , it was mildly amusing , but my third eye didn' t open .
well , these things take time .
and you don' t have time .
no , seriously .
it' s a question of values .
why is doing something fundamentally trivial better ... ... than living a responsible life ?
boring as that might seem to you .
and who made you the expert , the doctor , the guru ?
why do you have all the answers ?
well , i used to own this company called sublime pets .
no , i really did .
and then i quit .
it wasn' t fun anymore , you know .
before or after you toured as a standup comedian ?
i never did that .
well , this ....
this would be really good for you .
sharpen your instincts .
no , no .
not those kind of instincts .
so the object of the game get your hands off me .
i run around .
you lose track of me .
then you
no , no peeking .
hands off .
count to 10 ... ... then come find me .
one , two , three i' m gonna get you .
four , five , six i know where you are .
seven , eight , nine , ten .
oh , nelson , that was terrible .
you didn' t even get close .
this is funny ?
i' m sorry .
are you okay ?
sara , you' re not going to be upset when i leave tonight ?
i told you one day .
yeah , of course .
mitch was my october .
he was so shy .
i think he was the shyest man i' ve ever met .
so ... ... we focused on strengthening his confidence .
and was the patient cured ?
oh , yeah .
my treatment was so effective ... ... that we had to terminate the month early .
and what about september ?
no .
no september .
what ?
you didn' t think i was weird about it , did you ?
and you and all these guys ... ?
does it matter that much to you ?
why a month ?
it' s long enough to be meaningful and short enough to stay out of trouble .
it was delicious .
thanks .
it' s getting late .
don' t worry about this .
i' il clean it up .
what are you gonna do when you go home ?
i don' t know .
i don' t usually map out my evenings .
you' re gonna go home .
turn on your tv .
get bored .
turn on your computer .
go through your work .
get bored .
surf the net .
get bored .
and think of me .
ernie .
try to be wrong once in a while .
it' il do my ego good .
i don' t see why we didn' t take a cab .
because i make the rules , nelson .
rules you must submit to , utterly and completely .
if you want to be a dominatrix that bad ... ... why don' t we buy you the leather and get it over with ?
i think i' m strangely aroused .
that' s abner .
hi .
is that you ?
he' s got a face .
it' s a good one too .
did you wait long ?
no .
good .
what is that ?
you didn' t .
you did not bring that !
what can i say ?
yeah ?
just call me genius , i don' t mind .
what up , vince ?
" what up " ?
you , me , edgar price , november 1 7th , friday .
that' s what up .

he' s gonna have a lot of obstacles ... ... and he has to learn to deal with them .
those kids were laughing at him .

okay , cheating' s bad , i guess .
you' re a father figure now .

the kid just met me .
when you don' t know your dad , you' re not picky .
look at that , nelson .
that' s life .
it' s just happening around us all the time .
i think that' s so beautiful .

i' m not much on that kind of thing .
oh , come on .
everybody' s got one .
one they only tell after a couple of drinks .
tell me .
my father sold door to door .
vacuum cleaners , life insurance .
for a while he even sold plastic food .
we were kind of the joke of the neighborhood .
and believe me , the neighborhood was a pretty grim joke itself .
where' d you grow up ?
right here .
i still own the house , but i never go there .
bobby darin , perry como , tony bennett .
for a year or so ...
... l desperately wanted to be a singer .
you thought it would make him happy ?
no .
i thought those guys ... ... were everything he wasn' t .
successful , proud ... ... in control .
i' d like to hear you sing .
that will never happen .
come on .
one day .
one day you' il sing for me , right ?
what are we doing ?
the movie starts in 10 minutes .
should we skip it ?
i' il get you a cappuccino .
i can find a cappuccino .

i hope that i can eat all of this .
oh , my god !
somebody went domestic on me .
okay .
well , okay .
i get it .
it all makes sense .
mystery woman , unveiled .
what kind of bohemian backwater is this ?

sara , vince .
vince , sara .
hey .
very nice to meet you .
i gotta go .
was it something i said ?
vince , the movie .
oh , that' s my good friend , um ....
what , you can' t remember her name ?
she doesn' t care as long as i remember to pick up the check , right ?
that' s incredible .
i mean that is , i think , the most astute observation ... ... of female behavior i' ve ever heard .
she' s funny .
you' re funny .
that' s funny .
this is my very good friend nelson , and his very good friend ....
tell me .
sara .
hi .
lexy .
hi , nice to meet you .
lexy , sara .
sara , lexy .

sara , very nice to meet you .
it was an honor .
very entertaining .
god !
wow .
we' re going to be late , and it' s your fault .
he' s actually a good guy , deep down .
somewhere .
yeah .
i just mean the glibness ... ... kind of wears you out after a while .
do you trust him ?
like friends do , you know .
do you think he' il be there for you ?
when ?
like a scary situation or something .
you may have noticed ... ... l don' t put myself in scary situations .
hey , you know what ?
why don' t we go see that house you grew up in ?
want to do that ?
that' s not too scary , is it ?
it' s just a house .
i tried so hard not to come back here .
sorry .
ouch .
sara ?
i know i don' t know a lot of things , but i do know how to slow dance .
you' re terrible .
here , let me show you .
i looked up your web site the other night .
you sister' s pretty .
looks a lot like you .
but it' s not my web site anymore .
it' s not my anything anymore .
why' d you quit ?
it started out small and then it got big .
that' s generally considered a good thing in business .
yeah , well , everything got big .
egos , lives , desires .
i didn' t like the big me .
i wasn' t very happy .
you want to know the most amazing part of it all ?
what ?
i got out before it got really big .
can you imagine that ?
no , i can' t imagine you with millions and millions of dollars .
did you change the beans ?
it' s hazelnut .
you don' t like it ?
honestly ?
tastes like camel piss .
let' s stick to the classics .
excuse me , privacy .
heard of it ?
very impressive set of pecs you got .
you work out , then ?
me , haven' t got time .
your pecs on the other hand , darling , are edible .
now don' t forget , dinner' s at 8 .

come on .
you won' t be bored , i promise .
chaz cherry is a great cook .

excuse me , what did you just say ?
making , buying , it' s all a very thin line .
oh , my god .
i don' t believe it !
you know what' s a thin line ?
your outfit .
it' s a thin line between late cher and early howard keel .
eat up .
where we' re going , you go before 10 ... ... you get a good place to dance and boys get in free .
bring your dancing shoes ?
can you dance shirtless ?
it happens there .

it' s a scottish thing .
i mean , from concept to execution , it' s just sublime .
there you go , sweetie .
thank you .
your home base for everything .
from fast searches to shopping .
get whatever you want
just an ad .
now , don' t be modest .
i know you won a gold pencil for this .
how do you know that ?
well , i' ve got a day job as well , you know .

oh , my god .
nelson , just let it go .
cherry doesn' t care about things like that .
oh , really ?
cherry doesn' t care about things like that " ?
i bet chaz cares about things like that .
or do you two not talk to each other ?
i know nelson cares about things like that .
she should' ve told me .
this is
this is awkward .
if i' d known who you were , i wouldn' t have
what ?
you would' ve worn a dress ?
i don' t think so .
you would' ve been especially nice to me ?
yeah , something like that .
thanks very much .
he' s not here right now .
i said , he' s not here right now .
why are you calling here ?
how long have you been doing this ?
how long have you been calling here ?
i asked
i can' t i can' t talk .
i can' t talk right now .
i said , i can' t talk to you right now .
is everything okay ?
ten guesses who that was .
shit .
so , how long has it been going on ?
it' s not what you think .
you' ve talked to her behind my back ?
do you really want to talk about this now ?
no .
i' m sorry .
guys , i don' t think i' m gonna go dancing tonight .
i feel so tired .
come on , sweetheart .
what was that all about ?
she gets migraines .
you know ... ... terrible headaches .
no , the phone call .
who was that ?
her sister .
it' s a long story , and i am not going to tell it .
hey .
i' m sorry about what happened down there .
that' s okay , gives me a boost to know that you' re not perfect .
feeling better ?
yeah , i' m fine .
chaz told me it was your sister on the phone .
why does it upset you so much ?
remember talking about getting naked ?
naked with sara deever .
i think it' s a good time for that .
don' t dodge me , talk to me .
come get naked with me .
what happened ?
that' s not fair .
you expect me to be so honest ... ... so forthcoming .
i do .
because it' s your month , nelson .
not mine .
come on , you don' t want to hear about stupid family stuff .
don' t be mad .
please .
please .
you' re not feeling well , are you ?
maybe tomorrow we' il get naked .
and tonight ... ... we' il wear pjs .
every woman i know spends $200 on a haircut .
you use a vacuum cleaner .
quit trying to change the subject .
you made a commitment , nelson .
our time isn' t over .
it' s one meeting .
why is going to some powwow with this slicko guy , vince , such a big deal ?
because it' s probably the chance of a lifetime , that' s why .
if it' s a whole lifetime , why not just postpone it for one more week ?
wait , how about next month ?
you say , " thank you , i' il be there .
he' s one of the greats .
where' s my phone ?
i hate it .
nelson !
nelson !
damn it .
we can take anything and just sell it , make it work .
exactly .
i mean , we' ve done very well with telecomputer .
actually , i' m sure you' re aware of
no , i wasn' t .
we just won the ad age award for that spot .
i think that was last year' s spot .
so we have a symbiosis , the two of us , as a team
we know a lot of guys who do this for the awards , mr. price .
not to say we don' t get the awards  but still ... ... we' re not about the acclaim .
handholding , dinners ...
... sending prostitutes to the client .
prostitutes ?
who sends prostitutes ?
who doesn' t ?
we' re about the work .
if the work is great , it speaks for itself .
that' s all i need to know .
but are you married , any kids ?
no , we' ve avoided the family thing for quite some time .
most of our lives .
good .
because if you' re worried about quality of life or paternity leave ... ... or any of that other new age crap ... ... as much as i like you , we can stop right here .
i want to be your full time commitment .
i can do that .
we still had two weeks to go .
what' s two weeks ?
you' re kicking him out anyway .
good shot .
thanks .
you know what ?
i should' ve locked him in there .
i should' ve tied him to the bed .
what , do you mean you didn' t ?
it wouldn' t have stopped him .
you can' t force people to do what they don' t want to .
that' s the whole point of this thing , isn' t it ?
besides , i know guys like nelson .
you may have bitten off more than you can chew this time .
that' s what i like about him .
it' s also what scares the hell out of me .
just so you know , we' ve got a couple of great clients in our hip pockets .
plus , some leads on some new accounts .
so we come to you fully loaded .
you' re not selling me a car , holland .
frankly , i' m not impressed with you .
but your reputation precedes you .
and if i have to take him to get you , i will .
so here' s my offer .
it' s good as long as we' re at this table .
oh , my !
i' m so sorry !
excuse me .
that' s okay .
stop it .
you know , sweetie ... ... we are what we do in this world , and you' re a waitress .
all that requires is that you bring food and drink ... ... to and from the table without making a mess .
that' s it .
so when you screw up something as incredibly simple as that ... ... it doesn' t say a whole hell of a lot about you , does it ?
i' m i' m sorry .
if you gave a penny for her thoughts , you' d get change .
they ought to fire her .
i always say a bad hire strengthens the competition' s hand .
a good general feeds off his enemy .
actually , sun tzu said that last line .
in the art of war .
you' re right , nelson .
you' re very smart .
take a look , buddy .
not interested .
you don' t like my offer ?
it' s not the offer i don' t like .
it' s you .
nelson , wait nelson !
you know what ?
this isn' t  i hope you can afford this .
shit .
oh , jesus christ ....
what' s wrong with you ?
you just shit in god' s face .
if he' s your god , you' re in trouble .
he' s not for me .
he' s not for you ?
he is you .
you' re cloned from the same dna .
i' m not .
if i am , shoot me .
where' s the gun ?
it' s my career too !
you just blew it in there .
what is going on , man ?
i know what it is .
it' s the girl .
the new mystery woman .
what' s her name ?
don' t ignore me .
what' s her name ?
sara .
don' t you see what' s happening ?
she has got your balls in a jar .
i' m your friend .
i wouldn' t lie .
you blew it in there .
i' m sorry i cost you your job
i don' t need your pity , nelson .
you blew it !
you' re a loser , nelson .
loser !
fine .
i don' t need you , nelson .
have you ever heard of phalaenopsis sanderiana ?
it reminded me of you .
you got the job , didn' t you ?
best offer anyone ever made me .
so when do you start ?
we had a little problem agreeing on that .
he suggested immediately .
i suggested ...
... never .
never ?
never .
come on , let' s keep ernie .
nope .
i found a home .
he' s gotta go .
but you love this little monster .
soon i' il love another little monster .
cold , heartless woman .
what about vegan turkey stuffed with tofu and cranberries ?
ordering sounds better .
we' re not ordering thanksgiving dinner .
it' s the one time in life it' s good to be " trad .
in that case , are you inviting your family ?
no .
holiday fights are a little too traditional for my taste .
what do you fight about ?
everything .
religion , money , sex .
sara' s decisions .
sara' s unconventional ways .
sara' s lifestyle .
they think i' m a freak .
you are a freak .
anyway , boring subject .
i' m sure they miss you .
i know they do .
you know , there' s a good tradition called " making up .
you could try it .
yeah .
someday i' il have to do that .
mind walking him down ?
sure .
thanks .
come on , boy .
say goodbye to sara .
bye .
hey , come on , puppy .
thanks .
yeah .
sure .
see you , ernie .
hey .
why can' t she keep one for a change ?
i guess she helps more this way .
i' ve been thinking .
oh , yeah ?
if you want to adopt me , you can .
i mean , father sunday is on monday .
it would be good timing .
i don' t quite know what to say .
i' il tell you what ... ... l can' t adopt you ... ... but i' il come with you to father sunday .
promise ?
promise .
wait till my mom hears !
sara !
i have an announcement to make .
what' s wrong ?
are you okay ?
yeah , i' m fine .
what do you keep in there ?
nothing .
" nothing " doesn' t require a lock .
what' s wrong ?
so ... ... what' s the big announcement ?
don' t do the dodge .
am i okay ?
no , i' m not okay .
i miss ernie .
and i' ve got a migraine .
so ... ... what' s your big announcement ?
marry me .
what ?
will you marry me ?
sara , i stood on the street ... ... and i realized ... ... this is it .
life will never be better ... ... or sweeter than this .
i' m happy .
i' m in love .
marry me .
that' s incredibly sweet .
but you don' t understand .
yes , i do .
it all makes sense .
i want you .
i want this life .
marry me .
marry me , sara .
i can' t .
why not ?
because of me .
what about you ?
for god' s sake , sara .
please , just
just tell me what' s wrong .
tell me the truth .
i can' t .
sara ?
jesus .
i' m fine .
no , i' m fine .
i' m fine .
what the hell is going on ?
no , nelson .
no , nelson , no !
no .
is this what you wanted to see ?
this is it !
is this enough truth for you ?
does this make you happy ?
goddamn you !
you just couldn' t leave it alone !
sara , stop .
you just couldn' t leave it god , just leave it alone .
it' s non hodgkin' s lymphoma .
it' s a type of cancer .
you shouldn' t have to find out like this .
i' m sorry .
she' s gonna be asleep for hours .
you want to go for a walk , have a chat or something ?
yeah .
yeah , okay .
you said she stopped her treatments a year ago ?
what about the pills ?
it just gets her through the day .
she stopped trying to beat it .
she did it all for a year .
nothing worked .
look , i' m no doctor , but when you' re unchecked , wouldn' t that ?
yeah .
it' s spread everywhere .
how could she get involved with me and not tell me she was sick ?
i mean , what was she thinking ?
she was thinking you' d be the same as all the others .
she' d dump you after a month .
you' ve got to understand something .
she' s completely powerless .
with these rules , you know ... ... they give her the illusion and dignity of control .
it' s kept her alive .
the rift with her family , that' s what it' s about ?
these rules .
yeah .
her family couldn' t handle it .
they wouldn' t let go .
they kept trying to run her disease .
so she took off .
and came here ?
she told me if she couldn' t live a normal life ... ... she was determined to live an abnormal one the best way she could .
i don' t get it .
she loves life more than anyone i' ve ever met .
how can she just give up ?
you listening to anything i' m telling you ?
she' s not giving up .
she' s making the most of the time she' s got left .
don' t mess with that .
i' m sorry .
i didn' t want you to see any of this .
i wanted you ... ... to know me loving life , you know ?
come here .
will you do something for me ?
anything .
will you get me out of here ?
take me home .
okay .
jesus .
they' re here .
hey , darling .
hey , sweetie .
you' re sick ?
you look fabulous .
oh , this is just a lie .
you look great .
want a nice , warm bath ?
come on , sweetie .
we' il run you a bath .
what' s on the menu tonight ?
we have lovely appetizers .
nice codeine .
codeine ?
what else ?
donnatal , that' s your favorite .
come on , girl .
let' s get you in here .
okay .
nice and easy .
sara , i know doctors i could call .
no doctors .
i' m gonna be fine , nelson .
but you can' t be here .
i don' t want you here .
you can' t see this .
please , go .
okay , okay , he' s going .
i can' t stand by and do nothing , just watch her ....
die ?
that' s why she wants you to go .
go on .
hey , abner .
today' s not gonna be a great play day .
i know .
it' s gonna be father sunday .
did you forget ?
oh , god , i' m sorry , ab .
i can' t .
but you promised .
i guess i don' t have a dad .
i mean , i do , but i don' t know who he is .
so i brought nelson .
we do stuff , and it' s fun , because he makes me feel smart .
i guess i feel like ... ... if i got into trouble , he' d take care of me .
kind of like a best friend , just bigger .
thank you , abner .
i guess i' il see you tomorrow .
i don' t know .
i probably won' t be here tomorrow .
how come ?
i gotta do some thinking , make a tough decision .
sara thinks you don' t respect her choices ?
something like that ?
i don' t know .
you always see that stuff on tv .
i think you' re the coolest kid i' ve ever met .
i' il see you .
see you .
take care .
shit .
you all right ?
yeah .
yeah , i' m fine .
good .
i was planning on serving the pumpkin on the floor , so this is ....
this is really good .
oh , god , chaz .
please tell me we' re gonna have fun .
thanksgiving' s fun , right ?
it' s fun .
it' il be a riot .
come here .
give us a cuddle .
i need some fun .
you know , he asked me to marry him .
he' s not the first .
no , but it was the first time i wanted to say yes .
so why didn' t you ?
because , chaz , i let the whole thing go too far .
oh , yeah ?
too far for who ?
both of us .
anyway ....
no need to talk about it .
he' s gone .
well , you did kick him out .
he' il be back if you let him .
i don' t want him to come back .
right .
you know , it' s okay to break your own rules , sara .
you fell in love .
that' s great .
it may not follow your master plan , but you can' t control everything .
okay , just stop it .
i really don' t need this right now , chaz .
jesus !
there' s no rule that gives me the right to put him through all of this .
this hell .
i don' t ....
it' il just hurt him in the end .
it' il hurt , whatever you do .
we all will .
but ... ... if i' ve learned anything ... ... it' s that you should have those who love you near ... ... as long as you possibly can .
yeah .
toast !
toast .
happy we stole your land and killed your people day .
oh , al .
that' s a good one , al .
here' s to you .
here you go , babe .
here' s to you .

you shouldn' t have to wait .

ciao , santa .
i thought you' d never get here .
