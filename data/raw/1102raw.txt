read the charges .
dr. jumba jookiba
lead scientist of galaxy defence lndustries you stand before this council accused of illegal genetic experimentation .
how do you plead ?
not guilty !
my experiments are only theoretical completely within legal boundaries .
we believe you actually created something .
created something ? !
ha !
but that would be irresponsible and unethical .
i would never , ever ... ... make more than one .
what is that monstrosity ?
monstrosity !
what you see before you is the first of a new species .
i call it experiment 6 2 6 .
he is bullet proof , fireproof and can think faster than supercomputer .
he can see in the dark and move objects 3, 000 times his size .
to destroy everything he touches !
so , it is a monster .
hey , just a little one .
it is an affront to nature .
it must be destroyed !
calm yourself , captain gantu .
perhaps it can be reasoned with .
experiment 6 2 6 give us some sign you understand any of this .
show us that there is something inside you that is good .
hmm ?
meega , nala kweesta !
so naughty !
i didn' t teach it that .
place that idiot scientist under arrest !
i prefer to be called " evil genius " !
and as for that abomination ... it is the flawed product of a deranged mind .
it has no place among us .
captain gantu , take him away .
with pleasure .
hmm .
uncomfortable ?
oh ...
good !
the council has banished you to exile on a desert asteroid .
so , relax ... enjoy the trip and don' t get any ideas .
these guns are locked onto your genetic signature .
they won' t shoot anyone but you .
ow !
why , you ... !
may i remind the captain that he is on duty .
secure the cell !
aye , captain .
captain on deck .
all ahead full .
do ...
does this , uh , look infected to you ?
oh !
quiet , you .
gunfire in the cell bay !
open a channel .
he' s loose on deck c !
red alert .
seal off the deck !
security , converge on door seven !
deadly force authorised .
fire on sight !
there he is !
security to bridge .
it' s in the ventilation system .
he' s headed for the power ... ... grid .
what was that ?
i don' t think he' s on the ship anymore .
confirmed .
he' s taken a police cruiser .
yeah ... he took the red one .
yee haw !
hmm ? !
that' s it !
we got it .
we got it !
hyperdrive activated .
system charging .
he' s engaged his h drive !
warning guidance is not functional .
pursuit commander , that crazy trog is about to make a jump !
break formation !
get clear of that ship !
navigation failure .
do not engage hyper ...
get me galactic control .
where is he ? !
he' s still in hyperspace .
where will he exit ?
calculating now quadrant 1 7 , section 0 0 5 area 51 .
a planet called ...
ee arth .
i want an expert on this planet in here now !
what is that ?
water .
most of the planet is covered in it .
he won' t survive in water .
his molecular density is too great .
no ...
of course .
how much time do we have ?
we have projected his landing at three hours , 42 minutes .
oh , we have to gas the planet .
hold it !
hold everything !
earth is a protected wildlife preserve .
yeah .
we' ve been using it to rebuild the mosquito population which , need i remind you , is an endangered species !
am i to assume you are the expert ?
oh , i don' t know about " expert .
agent pleakley at your service .
can we not simply destroy the island ?
no !
crazyhead !
the mosquito' s food of choice , primitive humanoid life forms have colonies all over that planet .
are they intelligent ?
no , but they' re very delicate .
ln fact , every time an asteroid strikes their planet they have to begin life all over .
it' s fascinating , isn' t it ?
with this , i' ve been able to study ...
what if our military forces just landed there ?
well , that' d be a bad idea !
these are extremely simple creatures , miss .
landing there would create mass mayhem and planet wide panic !
a quiet capture would require an understanding of 6 2 6 that we do not possess !
who , then , mr. pleakley , would you send for his extraction ?
does he have a brother ?
close grandmother , perhaps ?
friendly cousin ?
neighbour with a beard ?
he got away ?
i' m sure this comes as no surprise to you .
i designed this creature for to be unstoppable .
which is precisely why you must now bring him back .
what ?
me ?
and to reward you we are willing to trade your freedom for his capture .
6 2 6 will not come easily .
maybe direct hit from plasma cannon might stun him long enough to ...
plasma cannon granted .
do we have a bargain , dr. jumba ?
b b but it' s a delicate planet !
who' s going to control him ?
you will .
very good , your highness .
i ...
i didn' t quite ...
uh , you' re not joking !
so , tell me , my little one eyed one on what poor , pitiful , defenceless planet has my monstrosity been unleashed ?

yeah .
you better not have rabies .
lf you have rabies the dogcatcher is going to have to cut ...
are you going to play dolls ?
you don' t have a doll .
this is scrump .
i made her , but her head is too big .
so i pretend a bug laid eggs in her ears , and she' s upset because she only has a few more days to ...
lilo !
lilo ?
lilo ?
oh , no .
you better be home .
hey !
watch where you' re going !
stupidhead !
i found a new place to dwell ...
oh , lilo !
lilo !
open the door , lilo !
go away .
you make me so lonely , baby
lilo ?
we don' t have time for this .
i get so lonely ...
leave me alone to die .
come on , lilo that social worker' s going to be here any minute !
you still can find some room ...
for broken hearted lovers to cry away their gloom
don' t make me so lonely
i get so lonely i could die ...
the bellhop' s tears keep flowin ' ...
you are so finished when i get in there !
well , they been so long on lonely street
they ain' t ever gonna look back ...
oh , i' m going to stuff you in the blender push " puree , " then bake you into a pie and feed it to the social worker !
and when he says , " mmm , this is great .
what' s your secret ?
i' m going to say ...
love ... and nurturing .
hi .
uh ...
you must be the , uh ...
the stupidhead .
oh !
oh ...
oh , you know , i' m really sorry about that and if i' d known who you were , of course i never would' ve ...

i' m nani .
nice to meet you , mister ... ?
bubbles .
mr. bubbles .
that' s a strange ...
yes , i know .
are you going to invite me in , nani ?
uh ...
i thought we could sit out here and talk .
i don' t think so .
right .
uh ...
and though it' s always crowded ...
this way .
you still can find some room
for broken hearted lovers to cry away their gloom
you make me so lonely , baby ...
uh ... wait here .
hey !
so ...
lemonade ?
do you often leave your sister home alone ?
no .
never .
well , except for just now .
uh , i had to run to the store to get some ...
oh !
you left the stove on while you were out ?
low heat !
just a simmer .
mmm !
it' s coming along great .
i found that this morning .
lilo !
there you are .
honeyface ... this is mr. bubbles .
nice to meet you .
your knuckles say " cobra .
cobra bubbles .
you don' t look like a social worker .
i' m a special classification .
did you ever kill anyone ?
we' re getting off the subject .
let' s talk about you .
are you happy ?
i' m adjusted .
i eat four food groups and look both ways before crossing the street and take long naps and get disciplined .
disciplined ?
yeah .
she disciplines me real good .
sometimes five times a day .
with bricks .
no ...
bricks ?
uh huh , in a pillowcase .
okay !
that' s enough sugar for you .
why don' t you run along , you little cutie .
the other social workers just thought she was a scream .
thirsty ?
let me illuminate to you the precarious situation in which you have found yourself .
i am the one they call when things go wrong and things have indeed gone wrong .
my friends need to be punished .
call me next time you' re left here alone .
yep .
ln case you' re wondering , this did not go well .
you have three days to change my mind .
blah .
eww !
lilo !
why didn' t you wait at the school ?
you were supposed to wait there !
lilo !
do you not understand ?
do you want to be taken away ?
answer me !
no !
no , you don' t understand ?
no !
no , what ?
no !
you' re such a pain !
so why don' t you sell me and buy a rabbit instead ? !
at least a rabbit would behave better than you !
go ahead !
then you' il be happy because it' il be smarter than me , too !
and quieter !
you' il like it , ' cause it' s stinky , like you !
go to your room !
i' m already in my room !
hey .
i brought you some pizza , in case you were hungry .
we' re a broken family , aren' t we ?
no .
maybe , a little .
maybe a lot .
i shouldn' t have yelled at you .
we' re sisters .
it' s our job .
yeah , well , from now on ...
i like you better as a sister than a mom .
yeah ?
and you like me better as a sister than a rabbit , right ?
oh ...
oh , oh , oh , oh .
yes .
yes , i do .
i hit mertle edmonds today .
you hit her ?
before i bit her .
you bit her .
lilo , you shouldn' t ...
people treat me different .
they just don' t know what to say .
i' il tell you what .
lf you promise not to fight anymore
i promise not to yell at you , except on special occasions .
tuesdays and bank holidays would be good .

the same thing happened yesterday .
you rotten sister !
your butt is crushing me !
why do you act so weird ? !
it' s me again .
i need someone to be my friend ... someone who won' t run away .
maybe send me an angel ... the nicest angel you have .
what we when hit ?
there it is .
it stay jammed under the fender .
we better call somebody .
we' re looking for something that can defend itself ... something that won' t die ... something sturdy , you know ?
like a lobster .
lilo , you lolo .
do we have a lobster door ?
no .
we have a dog door .
we are getting a dog .
so nice to see your pretty face again !
jumba ?
we need your name and address at the bottom of the form ...
the kennel' s back this way .

i have just determined this situation to be far too hazardous !
don' t worry , i won' t hit her .

that girl is a part of the mosquito food chain .
here !
educate yourself .
using a little girl for a shield .
this is low , even for you !
whoo hoo !

i' il meet you at 1 : 00 .
hmm ?
oh !

somebody do something !
oh , great !
he' s loose .
his destructive programming is taking effect .
he will be irresistibly drawn to large cities where he will back up sewers reverse street signs and steal everyone' s left shoe .
it' s nice to live on an island with no large cities .

whee !
uh uh uh ...

it' s unusually high for someone your size .
we have to fix that .
ay yi yi , lilo !
your dog cannot sit at the table .
stitch is troubled .
he needs desserts .
oh , you didn' t even eat your sweet potato .
i thought you liked them .

i just figured you might need some time ...
you smell like a lawn mower .

uh , b but ...
mm mm .
yeah ?
well , who wants to work at this stupid ... fakey luau anyway .
come on , lilo .
did you lose your job because of stitch and me ?
nah .
the manager' s a vampire and he wanted me to join his legion of the undead .
i knew it .
this is a great home .
you' il like it a lot .
see ?
uh , lilo ...
comfy .
hey !
hey !
what is the matter with you ?
be careful of the little angel !
it' s not an angel , lilo .
i don' t even think it' s a dog .
we just have to take him back .
he' s just cranky because it' s his bedtime .
he' s creepy , lilo .
i won' t sleep while he' s loose in the house .
you' re loose in the house all the time and i sleep just fine !
hey , what are you doing ?
stop that , stitch !
hey !
look at him , lilo .
he' s obviously mutated from something else .
we have to take him back .
he was an orphan and we adopted him !
what about " o' hana " ?
he hasn' t been here that long .
neither have l .
dad said o' hana means family .
huh ?
o' hana means family .
family means ... ... nobody gets left behind .
or ... ?
or forgotten .
i know .
i know .
i hate it when you use o' hana against me .
mmm .
don' t worry , you can sleep right next to me .
look how curious the puppy is .
this is my room , and this is your bed .
this is your dolly and bottle .
see ?
doesn' t spill .
i filled it with coffee .
good puppy .
now get into bed .
hey !
that' s mine !

mmm !
be careful of that !
you don' t touch this !
don' t ever touch it !
no !
don' t pull on her head !
she' s recovering from surgery .
no !
that' s from my blue period .
mmm ...
there .
you know , you wreck everything you touch .
why not try and make something for a change ?
ah !
wow .
san francisco .
save me !
eek !
no more caffeine for you .
this little girl is wasting her time .
6 2 6 cannot be taught to ignore its destructive programming .
ooh !
push that over .
what are you doing ?
nothing !
uh , say , i want to try it on .
no !
share !
let me try it !
hey !
ow !
you' re just jealous ' cause i' m pretty !
don' t move .
a mosquito has chosen me as her perch .
she' s so beautiful .
look , another one .
and another one !
why , it' s a whole flock .
and they like me !
they' re nuzzling my flesh with their noses .
now they' re , um , they' re ....
i think it might be a koala .
an evil koala .
i can' t even pet it .
it keeps staring at me , like it' s going to eat me .
hello ?
nani ?
hello ?
are you there ?
now , this is interesting .
what ?
6 2 6 was designed to be a monster but now he has nothing to destroy .
you see , i never gave him a greater purpose .
what must it be like to have nothing ... not even memories to visit in the middle of the night ?
nah !
hmm .
hmm ...
that' s the ugly duckling .
see ?
he' s sad because he' s all alone and nobody wants him but on this page , his family hears him crying and they find him .
then the ugly duckling is happy because he knows where he belongs .
hmm ...
want to listen to the king ?
you look like an elvis fan .
nani .
nani !
uh ... yeah ?
look .
we can' t go on together
with suspicious minds ...
suspicious minds ...
we can build our dreams ...
on suspicious minds ...
heard you lost your job .
well , uh , actually , i just quit that job because , you know , the hours are just not conducive to the challenges of raising a child ...
hey !
i am so sorry about that .
what is that thing ?
that' s my puppy .
really ?
thus far , you have been adrift in the sheltered harbour of my patience but i cannot ignore you being jobless .
do i make myself clear ?
