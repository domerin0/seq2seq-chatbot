oh , maxie , it' s not so bad .
we' il just have to entertain ourselves .
do ya need a break from modern livin '
do ya long to shed your weary load
if your nerves are raw and your brain is fried
just grab a friend and take a ride together
on the open road
come on , maxie !
all in all i' d rather have detention
all in all i' d rather eat a toad
my old man drives like such a klutz that i' m about to hurl my guts
directly upon the open road
there' s nothin ' can upset me
' cause now we' re on our way
our trusty map will guide us straight and true
roxanne , please don' t forget me i will return someday
though i may be in traction when i do
me and max relaxin ' like the old days this is worse
than dragon breath and acne , i' m so mad in a buddy buddy kind of mode
i think i may explode when i see that highway i could cry
you know , that' s funny so could i
just bein ' out on the open road
howdy , boys is this the way to nashville
watch it , mac or you' il be gettin ' towed
i' m in no hurry to arrive ' cause i' il be turnin ' 65
the next time i sees the open road
just a week of rest and relaxation
yeah .

very odd .
and it' s california or bust
look out , you dirtbags , eat my dust from now on i own the open road
it' s me and little maxie my pipsqueak pioneer
they' re partners forever westward ho
yee haw .
could someone call a taxi and get me outta here
to beverly hills 90210
oh , every day another new adventure
every mile another new zip code
and the cares we have are gone for good
and i' d go with them if i could
i got no strings on me i' m feelin ' fancy free
how wonderful to be
on the open road
sick of modern livin '
dad , you' re gonna get us killed !

i never wanted to go ... on this stupid vacation !
now look where you got us , dad !

you should' ve let me stay at home .

so you' d end up in prison .
prison ?
what are you talkin ' about ?
your principal called me ...
it' s not what you' re thinkin ' .
you even lied to me .
i had to .
you were ruining my life .
i was only tryin ' to take my boy fishin ' , okay ?
i' m not your little boy any more , dad .
i' ve grown up !
i' ve got my own life now .
i know that .
i just wanted to be part of it .
you' re my son , max .
no matter how big you get ... you' il always be my son .
there are times you drive me shall we say , bananas
and your mind is missin ' no offence , a screw
none taken .
still , whatever mess i land in
who was always understandin '
nobody else but you
oh , your moodiness is now and then , bewilderin '
and your values may be so to speak , askew gesundheit .
thanks who deserves a hero' s trophy
as we face each catastrophe
nobody else but you
nobody else but you
it' s just our luck
we' re stuck together
nobody else but you
is crazy enough to believe we' il come through
so your jokes are all let' s face it , prehistoric
and your music sounds like monkeys in a zoo
but when life becomes distressin '
who will i be s. o. s. in '
if you' re havin ' trouble guessing here' s a clue
though he seems intoxicated
he' s just highly animated
and he' s nobody else
but nobody else but you
we' ve turned into
a true blue duo
hard times we' ve had a few
like we' re thrown in the drink
like we' re tossed outta town
but when i start to sink
hey , i' d rather go down
with nobody else
but y o u
aw , dad .
well , anyway , i figure she' s never gonna wanna talk to me again ... much less go out with me .
what a dumb lie , huh ?
well , whaddya know ?
my maxie , in love .
gosh , you' re really growin ' up .
happened so fast i guess i sorta missed it .
well , i think the only thing for us to do now ... is to get you up on stage with this powerline feller .
uh , how are we gonna do that ?
now , you just leave that up to me .
no , dad , really .
i i think we should just , you know , forget it .
now , how come you always think i' m gonna lead you into some sorta calamity ?
uh , uh , da dad .
what' s wrong now ?
look !

waterfall !
dad !
