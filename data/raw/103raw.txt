yes , it is possible !
man can fly !
no , this can' t be happening !
a chicken ?
how bizarre .
even if a flightless bird could ascend into the stratosphere the lack of oxygen would make breathing nearly impossible .
also , he' s wearing pajamas so this must be ...
a dream .
precisely .
but we are still , however , going to crash and it will hurt .
the bank' s being robbed !
quickly !
surround the building !
go that way !
you go this way !
there he is !
come on !
after him , men !
that way !
he came this way .
i' m sure of it .
come on !
come on , mates !
keep up !
sorry , sir .
today is the day i will finally achieve what has been deemed impossible .
man can break the 50 mile per hour speed barrier .
and you' re lucky to be a part of it , pierre .
it' s jean michel , sir .
yes .
we will make history .
or we will die trying .
die ?
this is very exciting .
that' s it !
i refuse to be catapulted , electrocuted , or have my internal organs disrupted any longer !
i quit !
he is a very sick man !
the electrocution was not my fault !
you refused to wear the rubber underpants !
we' re looking for a bank robber .
is there no man brave enough to be my valet ?
oh ...
aah !
i' m your new valet .
uh ...
i must commend the valet service on their impeccable foresight .
but they know i only accept french valets .
yes .
oh !
oui !
oui !
i come from a long line of french valets .
on my father' s side .
very , very french .
but your accent .
my father french .
never speak .
my mother chinese and never shuts up .
all the children pick up her accent .
very well .
will you be willing to risk your life to challenge the laws of physics ?
yes .
uh , and i can sing , too .
excellent .
pop this little hat on .
he' s got to be in here .
he' s this way !
and the throttle in your right hand controls the speed .
how do i stop ?
godspeed !
uh ...
twenty five miles per hour .
yes , the pressure' s stable ish .
we need more speed , man .
waah !
wee yoo !
forty miles per hour .
hang on in there , my good man .
forty seven .
forty eight .
forty nine .
eureka !
we' ve done it !
uh ...
waaah !
i say , i say .
uh , good morning .
i' m looking for a man with ...
over here !
there he is .
there' s my valet .
sorry !
new valet .
whoa !
whoa !
good morning .
good morning .
you' il be able to let go any second .
the pack will run out of steam in exactly three , two , one .
now .
look out !
well done !
we' ve broken the human speed barrier .
good bye , sir .
it' s been very nice valeting for you .
let' s ... do it again soon .
please , wait !
with you as my brave valet , i can test all my inventions .
no !
spread out !
cover that ...
yes .
i take the job .
splendid !
i can' t wait to present my results to the academy .
too kind .
too kind .
thank you .
and with this grant to develop new applications for copper wire ,
dr. ramsey invented this .
needless to say , the royal academy of science declared this crackpot mentally incompetent , and he was duly dispatched to a lunatic asylum .
sir .
i have an urgent announcement for you .
here .
don' t just stand there .
read it .
oh .
um ...
it is with great distress that scotland yard announces that the bank of england has been robbed .
my stolen jade buddha stolen ?
you blighter !
you gave me every assurance that the bank of england was impenetrable !
sir , sir , i said , " lmpregnable .
it' s the same thing , you idiot !
please , please , not the quills !
lord salisbury !
please contact general fang and inform her , no buddha , no deal .
to forgo your obligation would be dishonorable , lord kelvin .
a woman in the royal academy ?
the jade buddha was delivered by us to the bank of england .
what happens while in british hands ...
is absolutely your concern .
colonel kitchner , chief of scotland yard , please inform general fang what other items were stolen from the bank .
nothing else .
exactly .
it seems your little land dispute has spilled over onto our noble shore .
until the jade buddha is back in my possession , you and your cause will receive no british military assistance whatsoever .
kitchner .
my agents will retrieve the jade buddha again , lord kelvin .
this time , do not let it slip through your fingers .
a female general .
what sort of pathetic man takes orders from a woman ?
cor !
come away from here .
oh , dad .
can' t we stay ?
my wind powered pulley system circulates the house with fresh air .
kitchen items are to be placed on the white boat , and the blue is for laundry .
but most importantly , this supplies the house with a running current of electricity .
electricity .
this is my comprehensive data schedule and list of regulations .
it' s quite simple .
you' re never to divert one iota from my plans .
i must live my life with total efficiency to maximize my inventing capacity , thus enabling me to do the most i can for mankind .
uh , mr. fogg , you are a noble , precise gentleman .
thank you .
uh ... sorry .
what was your name ?
ahem .
passport .
too .
passepartout .
bottled light .
a miracle .
hardly .
just undiscovered science from an american named thomas edison .
it turns on with a whistle .
please don' t do that .
ah , i see your eye is drawn to what i hope will one day be my crowning achievement .
a giant moth ?
it' s a flying machine .
it can fly ?
yes .
no .
but it will , one day .
when i' ve worked out the problem with the steering cables and that damn chicken .
one day it will transport people through the air .
perhaps over entire oceans .
uh oh .
i think i' m going to have to make a rule for this .
i will find the fastest way back to china ... to make our village safe once again .
passepartout ?
departure for the royal academy of science in two minutes .
prepare my urban transport device .
it' s the shoes with little wheels on them .
clear the way .
clear the way .
mr. fogg coming through .
watch out !
watch out !
excuse me .
out of way .
gangway .
fogg' s arrived .
gangway .
ooh !
hey !
that makes it exactly ten minutes before noon .
that will be all .
gentlemen .
today i have proved that man can break the 50 mile per hour speed barrier without disrupting his internal organs .
where is your royal academy of science authorization ?
what am i thinking ?
what a fool .
that would mean that you were a real scientist !
by your definition , a real scientist' s objective would be to prevent man from progress .
we live in a golden age , fogg .
everything worth discovering has been discovered .
yet ridiculous dreamers like you insist on a past filled with dinosaurs ... and evolution .
and on a future filled with motorized vehicles , radio waves , and flying machines !
confound it !
the bloody bank of england is a madhouse !
rumor has it the bloke' s a foreigner .
an asian chap .
rumor has it the bloke' s a foreigner .
nothing .
yes , i heard it was a chinese fellow , and he acted alone .
no .
actually , they say he was norwegian .
in fact , though , it was a gang of elderly norwegians .
i heard it from a very reliable source that it was a gang of redheaded elderly norwegians with very tiny feet .
it' s about time someone robbed that bank .
like this very institution , the bank of england is outdated .
as usual , your contempt for tradition is appalling .
you rest on your traditions , if you prefer , but , as with this bank robber , progress waits for no one .
so now you' re an expert on the bank thief as well .
give us the benefit of your ineffable wisdom , fogg .
twenty six minutes ago , a ship left dover for paris .
from there , the thief takes the orient express , where he transfers to a steamer , from istanbul to india .
in little over a month , that man could be in china .
if we' re to believe fogg' s calculations , he will have circled the globe and returned to england in a fortnight .
actually , by my calculations , it would be closer to , uh , exactly 80 days .
outstanding idea .
well , then , fogg ,
let' s see you circumnavigate the world in 80 days .
i ...
that would be a fruitless use of my time .
i' m on the verge of numerous ... countless ... scientific breakthroughs .
you coward .
admit it .
it cannot be done .
it can !
i could do it .
a wager . 10, 000 .
unlike you and your colleagues , money does not inspire me .
i believe every man has his price .
even you , o noble phileas fogg .
there must be something i could offer that would be worthy of your time .
there is .
your position as head of the royal academy .
i could lead britain and the rest of the world into a new age of progress and discovery .
fair enough .
what ?
i , lord kelvin , hereby vow to surrender my position as minister of science to phileas fogg ...
no !
no !
no !
if he can circumnavigate the globe ... in no more than 80 days .
but if he cannot , he must never set foot in this academy again , he must tear down that abhorrent eyesore he calls a laboratory , and he must swear ... never to invent again .
just as i always suspected , fogg .
you promise so much , yet you deliver ... oh , nothing .
i' il take your wager .
what did you say ?
i' il take your wager !
he did it .
then it' s done .
a man who has never set foot out of england circling the globe .
this is going to be rather amusing .
history won' t remember your amusement , but it will be hard pressed to forget the moment i' m standing on the very top step of the royal academy of science .
by the strike of noon , after i , phileas fogg , have traveled around the world in 80 days !
oh , dear .
mr. fogg , we all pack and ready to go .
mr. fogg , are you in here ?
phileas !
phileas !
phileas !
uh ...
mr. fogg , are you well , sir ?
huh ?
uh , passepartout .
would you ... sit with me a moment ?
yes , sir .
i risked everything , my entire life' s work .
for something you believe in .
nothing could make more sense than that , sir .
you are honorable , passepartout .
but i' m afraid this was a calamitous lapse of judgment .
mr. fogg ?
yes ?
let your family ...
there is no one left to tell .
this house and my inventions are all i have .
and a brave french valet that will help you make it around the world in 80 days .
you really believe we can succeed ?
yes .
yes .
yes .
yes !
you' re mad .
we' il be sliced to pieces before we reach india .
we' re with you , sir !
good luck !
halt !
quite a contraption here , mr. fogg .
thank you , inspector .
but i' m afraid i' m gonna have to detain you and your valet until further notice .
this here doohickey is in violation of the city' s new vehicle code .
vehicle code ?
code 431 .
all vehicles must be powered by horses .
or other indigenous quadruped creatures of the like , excluding giraffes and ...
you' re driveling .
stand aside .
i' m about to embark upon a journey around the world .
not in this monstrosity , you' re not .
no !
mm mm .
that' s hot .
it' s ...
ow !
time to go .
we have a boat to catch .
stealing a police vehicle is not an acceptable way to begin our journey .
not stealing .
borrowing .
excuse us .
we' re borrowing this vehicle to catch our ship to paris , if someone could inform the appropriate authorities .
bloody hell !
me brain' s leakin ' !
ahh !
damn that nincompoop fix .
what' s the point of hiring a corrupt police officer if he can' t abuse the law properly ?
kitchner .
sir !
tell fix to pack his bags .
he' s going on a trip .
right away , sir .
hmm .
smart man .
passepartout , tell this impudent fellow we must
leave within six and a half hours , or we miss our connection in constantinople .
yes , sir .
please .
we are in a great hurry .
passepartout ?
yes ?
in french .
sacre bleu , la champignon , chateau , bien , franoise , voil , ooh la la , foie de gras .
what did he say ?
uh ...
he say ...
what ?
he says not to worry .
the next train will leave in five hours .
good time for sightseeing .
passepartout , this is a scientific expedition , not a holiday !
i will not miss this train .
ah !
very amazing .
what ?
what does it say ?
eddie thomason will be showing his inventions .
thomas edison ?
here in paris ?
what a chance for you to meet another great inventor .
i would quite like to tell him about my whistle modification .
good idea .
see ?
exposition .
science .
i assure you these are not the works of thomas edison .
uh , i think he is somewhere around here .
wait a moment .
this isn' t science .
this is art .
yeah .
hmm .
that painting is highly inaccurate .
it' s not supposed to be accurate .
the artist views reality through imagination rather than simply recording it .
it is called " lmpressionism .
well , um , i' m not impressed .
trees are not violet , grass is not charcoal , and a man cannot ...
fly .
you feel something .
you dream of flying .
or of naked men .
sometimes .
ah .
the flying .
n n not the men .
i am glad you like my painting .
monique la roche .
phileas fogg .
i must say , it' s a lot better than these amateurs .
what did he say ?
oh , no .
non .
goodness .
what was that all about ?
well , a wealthy gentleman bought my painting for a lot of money .
champagne for everyone !
i' m still looking for mr. eddie .
nice painting .
have you considered a career in schematic drawing ?
no .
it would be far too limiting .
at least your work shows genuine promise .
thank you .
those i painted many months ago .
i was lacking inspiration .
i found some men to help me find mr. " edimon .
this way .
thank you .
thank you .
he' s very eager .
get him !
oh , no , no , no , no .
oh , it' s terrible , no ?
no , no , it' s ...
clever .
oh .
hmm .
yes .
he' s a clown .
mm hmm .
and yet ... he' s incredibly angry .
the irony is , uh , terrifying .
is that good ?
is it ?
ah , this is interesting .
without opposable thumbs , a dog could never play poker .
yes , they can .
where have you seen a dog playing poker ?
right there .
perhaps i' m not the best judge .
bandits !
they come to take away all the paintings !
quickly !
come this way !
passepartout !
go , go , go !
it is magnificent .
mr. fogg , his house is even bigger than yours .
his collection , his taste ...
it is exquisite .
yes , it is .
not good .
very old .
look .
broken .
and where is his highness ?
oh .
the prince is also a talented musician .
if i did nothing but lounge about the palace ,
i' d learn to pluck a few notes .
let' s make this brief .
i' il pose for photographs , wearing a turban , holding an atlas ...
mademoiselle .
how magical that our paths should cross .
do you believe in fate ?
is that what you call it when one stops a train and kidnaps its passengers ?
phileas fogg .
please forgive me , but i feel like aphrodite herself descended to earth .
what is a ravishing woman like you ...
i never think when i' m naked .
i do .
in the bath .
yes .
well , i mean ...
no !
don' t touch it !
that is my most treasured possession .
i was only pointing .
i was just ...
don' t even point .
rodin .
yes .
a rodin .
oh .
i have never seen a more beautiful ... muscular form .
well , i can assure you , i' m in much better shape now .
incroyable .
it is a sculpture of you !
yes .
hapi birthday .
your pal , rodin .
come , my dear .
let us dine .
yes .
ah , mr. fogg , please join us .
no , sorry .
we are on a tight schedule .
we will join you , actually .
but just one drink .
after the duke and the duchess sat down in the bath ,
i realized i forgot to put on my bathing suit .
i' m such a fool .
always embarrassing myself in front of visiting dignitaries .
but you know how that can be , right , phil ?
uh , yes .
uh , it' s phileas , actually .
so , foggy , tell me .
i heard you' re an inventor .
well , i try to apply myself to thinking of new ways to help better mankind , if that' s what you mean .
well , i' m not an inventor , but i did develop a new way of irrigating dry land so that no one in my kingdom ever has to be hungry .
oh .
mr. fogg invented wheelie shoes .
not now , passepartout .
oh .
mmm .
miss la roche .
hmm ?
it is mesmerizing , the way your face illuminates .
oh ...
her discoloration could be an allergic reaction or a mild form of hives .
although i' ve noticed a certain
luminescent glow about her complexion when she' s drawing .
and sometimes , when she' s ... concentrating on her latest work , her ears will actually flutter .
it' s rather fetching .
guess who else was in this bath .
u. s. president rutherford b. hayes .
shouldn' t we be going ?
we have a schedule to keep .
thank you for your hospitality .
it' s been absolutely fascinating , but i' m afraid we must push on .
yes .
very well .
the gentlemen are free to go .
but miss la roche ... stays here with me .
to be my wife .
hmm ?
yes .
wife number seven .
you have seven wives ?
one for each day of the week .
this is absolutely ridiculous !
no more talk !
prince hapi has spoken !
well , we did say one drink .
passepartout , we' re leaving .
i can tell when we' re not wanted .
monsieur fogg !
do tuesdays work for you ?
good bye .
thank you !
no !
halt !
or hapi gets smashed !
please !
anything but my statue of me !
miss la roche , please join us , if you will .
all of you , drop your weapons .
do as he says !
get in the tent .
everybody !
now !
let' s go .
come on .
now , take off your clothes and throw them ...
uh ...
i assure you the statue is not armed ... harmed in any way .
get them !
his arm !
thank you , phileas .
that was very heroic .
yes , and needlessly time consuming .
this is exactly why i should never have let you come along .
kill them !
i want my arm !
no !
sir !
i' ve received a telegram from inspector fix .
a ha !
according to him , the bank thief and fogg' s valet are the same man .
fogg doesn' t realize he' s transporting the bank thief !
or does he ?
he did leave town in quite a hurry .
wouldn' t you say , lord rhodes ?
indeed , lord salisbury .
eh , evading arrest , stealing a police vehicle , sounds rather incriminating to me .
one can almost deduce this entire bet was merely a ruse to facilitate his escape .
don' t you agree , lord kelvin ?
yes .
brilliant , lord salisbury .
i shall name a beef related entre after you in your honor !
kitchner !
sir !
inform your men at scotland yard that phileas fogg is without a doubt the man who robbed the bank of england !
where are they now ?
they' re taking a train across india , from bombay to calcutta .
thank god we own india !
i want their faces in every police station , army barracks , post office , railway station and outhouse in india !
we' re going to stop fogg and get my jade buddha back by any means necessary !
agra is where we will capture them !
intercept them at agra !
carry on , cutter !
move it !
move it !
fall in !
and they were the greatest kung fu boxers .
ten tigers of canton .
brothers in arms .
they fought to keep order and justice in china .
the most famous of ten tigers is wong fei hung .
armed with only bamboo sticks ...
it' s salivating on ... please .
is this your goat ?
did they really fight like tigers ?
each tiger have their own animal fighting style .
like tiger .
snake .
snake head , snake tail , snake mouth , snake tongue !
where are my calculations ?
monkey !
the goat !
passepartout , i' m being attacked by a ferocious animal !
it has small horns .
sorry , mr. fogg .
please keep that inconsiderate beast away from me .
and refrain from ridiculous anecdotes .
why do you not like his story , mr. frog ?
it' s fogg .
phileas fogg .
how could a man learn to defend himself by watching animals behave like ...
animals ?
it is famous legend .
a ridiculous legend .
most legends are born from truth .
yes .
but all truths are born from facts .
solid , tangible facts that can be calculated and written down on paper .
and then eaten by a goat .
mr. feelsillious , when i tell the story of the man who circled the entire world in 80 days , would that not be a legend ?
only if the man' s name was feelsillious frog .
what the blazes is it now ?
come this way !
come on !
look sharp , now .
get ' em !
find these men !
uh oh .
time to go .
they seem to think we robbed the bank of england .
preposterous .
this is a desperate attempt by lord kelvin to impede my journey .
i am a british citizen .
i have nothing to fear .
except bullets .
listen up !
have you seen these men ?
come on !
any word on the bank thieves , sir ?
they were on the train .
keep your rifles ready .
they won' t get past us , sir !
ladies , have you seen these two men ?
look closely .
they' re very dangerous .
they' re everywhere !
this is not going to work !
just act like ladies .
not a problem .
hello .
hello !
ah .
i feel faint .
phileas , women are not that weak !
no , but i am .
hello , darling .
what can i do for you , eh ?
what nice hand , nice eye , nice hair ...
hang about !
mr. fogg , what are you doing ?
this is no time to sleep .
stop , stop .
go , go , go !
get us out of agra quickly .
passepartout , we did it .
hey , wrong way .
ah !
phileas ?
no !
no !
aah !
run !
run , passepartout !
ah !
ah !
ahhh !
fogg' s valet !
heh !
what are you doing ?
now i gotcha !
hand over the jade buddha !
oh !
you' re under arrest !
whoa !
watch me plums !
ooh !
now you get him very mad !
let' s go .
stop , or i' il arrest you as well !
run !
which way ?
down !
again !
down !
jump !
go , go , go !
what' s upsetting him ?
he wants the jade buddha !
then give it to him !
phileas , wake up !
please , please .
you must go .
my husband will be home soon .
phileas !
ow !
ay !
phileas , help !
leave her alone !
i' il protect you !
ah !
i' m here , my dear .
uh , that stumble was simply to buy me time .
this cane is not as it appears .
if i depress this button , it would deploy a weapon more deadly than yours .
this ... is ... a strange knife .
isn' t it a sextant ?
yes .
huh .
are you all right , my dear ?
phileas , that was so unlike you .
ah !
you men , come with me !
you' d better put this on .
perhaps i should wear women' s clothing more often .
oh .
we should run .
what , now ?
mm hmm .
yes , we should run .
break down the door !
okay .
no , not me brains !
give me the jade " bu ddha " !
okay , okay .
what' s " bu ddha " ?
get ready to jump !
now !
it is him , the englishman who robbed the bank of england !
he' s escaping in that palkee garry !
hey , there he is !
they' il check all trains heading east .
if we could make it to the coast , we can' t sail into singapore or hong kong .
they' re both british colonies .
does england own everything in asia ?
