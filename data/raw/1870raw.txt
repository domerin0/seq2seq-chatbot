... in order to strategically evaluate " g " we will replace an " r " with the appropriate distance and mass .
so the acceleration of gravity " g " is determined , uh , by " m " and " r " at the earths surface .
now we know that objects , uh , vary from place to place so in order to evaluate it we will simply use " m g " .
now if we want to , uh , evaluate an object some distance from the earth ...
yes !
katlin .
perhaps you can answer the equation if , for example ,
g equals six point four times ten to the sixth ?
um , v equals ...
six point zero times ten to the twenty fourth power .
pretty good , katlin .

five bucks is all right .
its entertainment .
if there werent gamblers in this family , there wouldnt be any food on the table .
you run a hedge fund , honey , youre not bat masterson .
listen , cheryl and i are putting it all towards europe .
but its matt birmans pool .
hes the one really raking it in .
i could make a ton more if i had my own pool ...

this matt birdbrain , or whatever his name is , can loose that money just as easily as he wins it .
and thats the risk .
ok , but seriously , mom , i mean ...
katlin .
i said no .
so please dont turn to your mother .
now , this is exactly what i have been talking about .
i was gonna say no too .
i dont want her in any pool .
gambling is cheesy , katlin .
it doesnt suit you .
i\ x9d s not cheesy .
but if youre gonna play , you set yourself a five buck limit , you dont chase your losses and do your research .
oh , gawd , dont say that .
