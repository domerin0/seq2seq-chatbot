let me put this another way .
if i am not given complete and unfettered command of this situation ... ... you can , if i may put it politely , sir ... ... take this job and put it where you choose because i' ii damn weii quit .
my other generals say it' s unwise .
too much responsibility for one man .
then find other generals .
even your own other generals say the same thing .
then i' ii also find new ones .
i know who we' re talking about here , prime minister .
your air marshai harris and my generai jimmy spaatz .
the raf and the u. s. 8th air force want to fight their own war .
win it with strategic bombing .
they think  i know what they think , general .
and it is very seductive .
continue the saturation bombing of the continent ... ... untii the enemy' s iost his wiii to fight .
leave him defeated and dispirited ... ... before your invasion force even sets foot ashore .
if there' s a shore to set foot on .
that kind of bombing would turn paris into a soccer field ... ... hoiland into a swimming pool .
you were an infantry officer , prime minister .
we both know wars can only be won on the ground .
america did not send a miilion of its finest men to stand by ... ... while faceless aircraft destroy the europe they' re wiiling to die to save .
and i don' t believe you railied the british people to fight on , alone ... ... aii these iong years to bear so much ... ... only to see the great cities of europe become heaps of rubble .
we have to do more than iiberate europe .
we have to save it .
we' re soldiers , you and i.
there can only be one commander .
one conductor of this orchestra .
one supreme commander ... ... in the air , on the ground , at sea .
or face interservice bickering , clashing egos ... ... conflicting operationai deployments .
one invasion , one commander .
as the ailies prepare for our greatest chailenge of the war ... ... our ieaders must not iose sight ... ... of the true measure of military ieadership .
the victories of generai montgomery ... ... at ei alamein , sicily and every campaign he has undertaken ... ... deserve prime consideration .
his hand is never far from such forward momentum ... ... as we have enjoyed in this war .
no other generai can make that claim .
i could go on , but they' re aii much of a muchness .
i don' t deny monty' s achievements as a field commander .
whilst you can make no such claim .
come , come , general .
don' t take offense .
we' re too close for that .
monty' s not the man for this .
we both know it .
far too in love with his image .
there' s no shortage of men who would iike the title " supreme commander .
or even a part of it .
and i we must identify each man ... ... and decide whether or not he is fit .
harris ?
far too oblivious to destruction .
certainly not spaatz .
too flamboyant .
marshail ?
you know f. d. r. won' t iet him ieave washington .
and mountbatten is commanding in the pacific .
then who ?
your own mr. roosevelt has his doubts about a supreme commander .
i ieave him to you , sir .
you' ii be able to set him straight .
no human in history has ever held the power for which you now ask .
not caesar , not alexander , no man .
ever .
but this is eisenhower you' re considering .
is this relatively untried american the right man for the job ?
very popular with the men .
irrelevant .
disciplined soldiers fight at their ieader' s command ... ... whoever that might be .
my victories that brought us back north africa ... ... weren' t won because i was popular with the ordinary ranks .
no , i dare say .
brandy ?
no , thank you .
oh , i forgot your strict scruples .
general , iet it not come as a surprise to you .
the decision is as good as made .
there wiii be no turning back .
eisenhower is to be supreme commander .
that is the consensus of the ailies .
i see .
politics first , is it ?
yes ?
yes , chief whip ?
time to prepare for the afternoon question period , prime minister .
one iast thought , prime minister .
there' s more than one way to skin this cat .
if things remain as they are ... ... iet eisenhower be the de facto figurehead .
just don' t formalize it .
leave some room for the rest of us .
oh , i' m sure you' ii find some way to maneuver , general .
you know my admiration for your soldiering skiils .
there are two kinds of problem drinkers , chief whip .
those who drink too much and those who drink too iittle .
i believe it' s a religious thing with the general .
strict methodist , i think .
oh , might be an asset .
way the odds are on this thing ... ... we could use somebody on close terms with god .
giving monty a private audience ?
you could caii it that .
man' s a pain in the ass .
kind of megalomaniac who' s got his own ideas how to win this war .
he' ii never accept you .
i admire churchiii much as any man ... ... but not even he could seii that without some sticking in the craw .
churchiil' s not there to seil .
his job is making decisions .
mine is to make them work .
yeah , weil , you' re tough enough to make it happen .
even with the generals and admirals he offended .
i' m glad you feei that way because if we foui up ... ... we' ii end up sharing a supply desk in washington .
you' d iose your operationai rank .
they' d take away three stars .
remember ' 38 in the summer ?
yeah .
careers had stailed .
we figured we' d be passed over ...
... and mustered out within a year .
as colonels .
yes , as colonels .
so we' d stiii be ahead of the game .
now , teii me about the tanks in the sand .
those beaches aren' t reaily sand .
they' re pebble and rock .
your 3 : 00 meeting is here .
your unfriendly friendly .
i' ii slip out the back .
tut tut .
needlessly timid , if you ask me .
and i trust you are asking me .
of course .
that' s why we' re here .
for a frank discussion , just you and me .
good .
then i wiii be frank .
like aii battles , this one wiii be won on the ground .
but not necessarily by infantry men , one foot at a time .
armor can slash through first , ieaving infantry to consolidate gains ... ... but that requires a flexible master plan .
we might find a sudden iunge across the iow countries , a dagger aimed ... ... at the heart of berlin could end the war by christmas .
the concept for a broad ianding at normandy has been approved .
given the politicai sensibilities involved ... ... there' s no going back on that .
you' re the supreme commander .
the politics are your concern .
my interest is the most effective strategy ... ... and tacticai moves to support it .
a massive invasion wiii be tipped to jerry' s inteiligence , we know that .
he' ii be ready to defend across a broad front .
a slashing blow wiii be harder for him to concentrate his troops against ... ... with any depth .
unless the german knows where the slashing blow is coming .
then , as you put it , with his inteiligence alerted ....
you' re being inflexible .
i' m adhering to a master plan .
once we have established beachhead , we can reexamine our options .
i see .
and as commander of aii iand forces , i' ii have my say in that reexamination ?
absolutely .
now , iet me outline my expectations ... ... for your ground forces once ashore .
here , the ground slopes easily .
sir , it wouldn' t take more than 1 5 minutes .
fifteen minutes better spent on reai work , captain .
with respect , sir , public relations is reai work .
i know you don' t have time for the press ... ... but folks back home need to know you .
human face of the ieader , sir .
mr. roosevelt is their ieader , and mine .
yeah , but  interview division commanders .
try some platoon sergeants .
what about my chief of staff , generai smith ?
what do you say , beetle ?
want to show the world your human face ?
sorry , sir .
i wasn' t issued one .
this isn' t macarthur' s hq , where he has to be at the center of everything .
we' re a team here .
so go get some publicity for the running backs .
that is ail .
yes , sir .
he' s arrived .
i saw .
i could hardly miss it .
beetle , he' s briiliant , but sometimes he acts iike a child .
are you thinking of sending him home ?
let' s have him .
he' ii see you now .
you gonna keep the helmet on ?
damn right .
i think you know why you' re here .
more or iess .
some prep head politician stateside got pissed at the truth .
that' s neither more nor iess , george .
it' s damned ignorant .
anglo saxons to rule the postwar world . " what the heii is that ?
the straight skinny .
when this is over , it wiii be us and the brits ... ... have to put the world back together .
that' s gonna come as a surprise to stalin ... ... who' s iosing miilions on the eastern front .
yeah , communism' s for the next war .
goddamn it , george .
shut up .
the czechs are also in this war .
and the dutch and the danes and god knows who else .
and above ail ... ... it' s racialism .
it' s the very thing we' re fighting .
i can' t have my generals spouting idiocy hitler would applaud .
anglo saxon superiority ?
that' s exactly the kind of pigheaded crap ... ... that wiii make stalin think we are the next enemy .
sometimes i think you don' t have the vaguest idea why we' re fighting .
that' s not fair , ike .
it is if it' s true .
i' m not sending a bunch of fresh young kids from iowa and california ... ... and new york and nebraska to die on french beaches for the freedom ... ... of people they know nothing about so we can establish a new raciai order .
i' m asking them to die to prevent precisely that .
and they' re ready to do it .
and that' s why they' re heroes .
and why slapping a sheil shocked soldier as a malingerer is never ... ... never permissible !
do you understand me , sir ?
you should know that despite the fact ... ... that he doubts your worthiness to command ... ... that generai marshaii has ieft it to me to decide how to handle this .
so i ask you again .
do you understand ?
sir , yes , sir .
i understand completely .
i do , ike .
i swear i do .
what i don' t get , i' ii study .
i promise .
i swear , i promise .
just please ... ... don' t send me home .
please , ike .
i couldn' t bear to be in washington when the show starts .
don' t do that to me .
i beg you .
soldier to soldier , that i' ii keep my mouth shut .
i promise you .
soldier to soldier .
soldier to soldier .
i wish it were that simple .
you were my mentor .
my senior officer , who told me once a iong time ago ... ... that one day i' d be giving him orders .
weil , that day' s come , george .
and that' s the truth .
soldier to soldier .
last time , georgie .
last time .
thank you .
sir , may i return to my headquarters now ?
gentlemen .
played him iike a violin .
ate out of my hand , he did .
drive on .
how' d it go ?
i' m keeping him on .
probably thinks he put one over on me .
heil , maybe he did .
let' s keep him in maidenhead , commanding his fictitious army .
now rommei thinks he' s my ace .
besides , once we get ashore , i' ii need him ... ... to command reai tanks .
traff , what you got ?
early estimates of airborne iosses .
assume perfect weather , and we go with a fuii or half moon .
no crosswind at the drop zone , iosses could be iow as 8 percent .
but should any of the elements turn against us , casualties wiii spiral .
they might hit a quarter or more .
one in four .
what' s the split between wounded and dead ?
oh , with paratroopers , one might as weii assume they' re aii dead .
a wounded jumper is a cripple .
and we aii know this enemy .
i' m ahead of you .
what the heii time is it ?
it' s 0520 .
but you want to be woken for this .
in from southwest command , just decoded .
aii chiefs of staff in the map room , 20 minutes .
no doubt in your mind about this ?
afraid not .
the craft' s scars could only be made by krupp essen u 2 1 0 torpedoes .
then the german is right off the coast .
what about damage ?
too much for a ioner .
absolutely .
this was a fuii pack .
in daylight , c search patrols can spot e boats ... ... as soon as they come close enough to fire torpedoes .
but at night , under radar ....
then what in damnation were men doing out there after nightfail ?
landing craft drivers were having a difficult time ... ... managing these new duplex drive craft .
they' re fragile in anything but good weather .
division commander felt they needed more experience .
then the man is a damned fooi and should be relieved of his command .
you won' t find any of my divisionai commanders ... ... playing siily buggers with jerry concealed .
how many ianding craft iost ?
first estimates are at 1 1 , possibly 1 2 .
but we' ve only seen two or three huils .
any intercepted jerry signals ?
e boat captains radioed berlin , claiming two dozen .
we went on the air with a decodable signal ... ... to patton' s fictitious army ... ... saying it iost five ianding craft .
first reports back from signai corps ... ... indicate jerry bought the whole program .
i' d be surprised if jerry' s reaily buying the idea ... ... that the bulk of our forces are in the east .
i wouldn' t .
not with activity in the southwest .
i take your point .
but we have fake tanks , trucks and ianding craft ... ... deployed throughout that entire region .
and our psychologicai warfare squads in norwich ... ... generate more radio traffic than our entire force doubled .
they use a new magnetic wire that records morse messages ... ... and repeats it night and day .
from what we monitor ... ... the germans have moved a fuii signai battalion to dieppe ... ... in order to sort it out .
we have patton' s hq in maidenhead .
the enemy is certain he wiii be field commander of any ailied invasion .
they can' t imagine anyone else .
weil , heil .
if hitler had half his wits about him , he' d be on monty' s taii night and day .
and there is no sign that the 3rd air fleet , the 1 6th army ... ... or any of 1 6 panzer divisions southward .
i think we fooled them .
he believes patton' s fictitious army is real .
he' s not reaily watching normandy .
for now , at ieast .
precisely , for now .
rommel' s no fool .
sooner or iater , he' ii figure out there' s a iimit ... ... to the size of our force , send flights ... ... to inspect patton' s army and discover ... ... that aii his tanks and trucks are nothing but papier mache .
teii me about these men we iost .
and what is this duplex drive problem on the damn ianding craft ?
the dds ?
weil , the men caii them donald ducks ... ... because they' re not that easy to understand .
it takes practice to reach the skiii ievei necessary ... ... to master the two output ievels .
one for the high seas and the other for soft iandings on a beach .
we were short of the bloody things before .
that' s an entire battalion' s passage gone .
could be a month before we get replacement craft .
it' s only 1 9 days to the half moon and the right high tide .
look , if we can trick rommei for 1 9 days through to mid may ... ... surely we can push him to the next usefui moon and tide .
that would be june 5th , sir .
aii this dithering around is bloody annoying , generai eisenhower .
my men are ready to go .
i say the sooner the better .
leaving it to june is a tremendous risk .
what if there' s a storm ?
then we' ve iost june .
we have to put it off to july .
six weeks to september .
it' s not enough to iand the army .
we have to get tanks ashore , get inland ... ... before the worst of autumn weather slows us down .
what can you give me in june , stagg ?
expecting a fine english summer , sir .
i mean , meteorology' s a fair bit of witchcraft ... ... but aii indications are for one of our better junes .
three extra weeks means at ieast 1 00 more lsts .
give us more time to pulverize the raii iines out of germany .
and railheads in france .
the men are impatient .
duils their itch .
and sooner or iater ... ... we won' t be able to hide the size of our force in the southwest .
may 1 9th or june 5th ?
or the fail safe iast chance in july ?
mid july .
leaving maybe eight weeks , if there' s an early frost ... ... to establish a beachhead for half a miilion men .
how doable is that ?
that' s what i thought .
please have it factored in for the next meeting , gentlemen .
thank you .
i know the reason you' re here .
of course , the ioss of these men is ....
yes , of course .
but i was referring to your other reason .
other reason ?
you have the advantage over me , sir .
i certainly hope so .
it' s my job .
i am told you' ve committed to june .
given up on a may ianding .
i assume monty kept you informed .
no names , no pack driil .
but of course , general , you are in britain .
you must assume i have resources to keep myself in the picture .
and i understand from mr. roosevelt ... ... that the additionai time wiii increase the number ... ... of these newfangled ianding craft .
the president is my security ieak ?
hardly .
but even if he were , he is your superior .
and my good friend and aily .
never forget , general , you serve at our pleasure .
then if it please you , sir , we need to delay tiii june 4 or 5 .
i' m promised exceilent weather .
by then , we wiii have 1 00 more ianding craft .
so ... ... the fate of our two great nations comes down ... ... to things cailed lsts and donald ducks .
weil , if it be so , so be it .
and yes , general , i accede to you once more .
june it is .
good .
thank you .
but that raises another problem , sir .
further delay creates almost unbearable pressure on our security .
we can' t iet the germans sense we' re only making a feint at calais .
if rommei moves his main force to normandy , we' d be stacking bodies .
there' s only one way to be certain that german spies ... ... or ioose iips don' t stumble across our activities ... ... and anticipate our moves .
that is to seai the coast across the south of england and wales ... ... to aii unauthorized traffic .
most of it is sealed already .
i mean aii of it .
no civilian traffic whatsoever .
are you mad , sir ?
do you not realize that no one in britain ... ... iives more than 1 50 miles from the sea ?
it is no accident that britannia rules the waves and aii that business .
we are a people whose entire destiny is iinked to the sea .
which is why you must now turn your people away from it .
impossible .
it might mean thousands ... ... tens of thousands of young men' s iives .
i wiii give you this , general .
you know how to take charge .
it' s not about power , sir .
it is simply the judicious use of the responsibility you entrusted me with .
only under duress and your threats to walk out .
i' d have you remember that .
yes , sir .
the ministry of information unedited footage ... ... spied by the 3rd red army film corps .
the surrender of the german 7 th army .
hitler refuses to allow further withdrawal .
throws three panzer divisions from the western front to the east .
they' re on the apc .
look at that .
three iess we have to face .
one more reason to rethink a broad front .
ride a dagger thrust road straight to berlin .
and we' ii have the french to help us along .
smuggled , unedited film from warsaw ghetto ... ... where jews resist an entire german army for six weeks .
twice as iong as the weil fed french army in 1 940 .
don' t count on them to help us along .
supreme commander meets with soldiers of the line .
give me five minutes .
i' ii have tonight' s feature ready .
what have you got ?
sahara .
bogart wins the war in north africa .
not bloody iikely .
i' ii be off , then .
i' ii walk you out .
it' s supposed to be a good movie .
not much taste for cinema , myself .
besides , never enough time for preparation , is there ?
weil , we aii need some recreation .
movie once a week , iet the hair down , it seems to do the trick .
if you say so .
although , if you don' t mind me saying so ... ... that jeering when you came on the screen , a bit much , you know .
good natured , as i see it .
undisciplined .
so is using german troop movements ... ... to push your plan for a dagger thrust again .
the broad assault is a closed matter .
i ailow aii my sub commanders iatitude , general ... ... but restraint is also a virtue .
yes , sir .
point taken .
he iooks cold .
yeah .
but if we get our asses kicked , we won' t be walking across snowy tundra .
we' ii have to swim back .
truth is , i wasn' t iooking at napoleon .
i was thinking about the soldiers .
johnny' s graduating from the academy this session .
june 6th .
proud moment .
have your son succeed you at west point .
yeah , i can' t believe i won' t be there .
cheer him and shake his hand .
you' ii see him soon enough .
and when you do ....
yeah .
it stinks .
it does .
but any way you iook at it , we' re getting off easy from this war .
i' ii most iikely iive to see it over .
and my son won' t be in it for as iong as most .
but on the other hand ... ... this war is stiii your burden .
and the rest of us , we' re just supporting cast .
if it' s any comfort ... ... so far , general , you are giving one heii of a great performance .
i don' t think i needed to hear my job described ... ... quite iike that , generai smith .
i loved your crack at monty about the french .
oh , thank you .
we bought them from harrods .
harrods ?
oh , he splashed out .
wow , that is beautiful .
a iousy wine , edgar .
but not for iong , huh ?
soon be downing the best french stuff .
what do you say , edgar ?
i reckon four days from the beaches to paris .
get there on the 8th .
i have no idea ... ... what you' re talking about , henry .
nor do you , get it ?
watch it , colonel .
remember who you' re talking to .
major general .
don' t you damn weii forget it either , henry .
come , edith , it' s time we powdered our noses .
henry , you' re a goddamned idiot .
just button it up .
what' s the big deal ?
the whole world wiii know soon enough .
it is a 1 00 to 1 shot because it' s more than the line of duty .
there' s so little chance of any us coming out of it .
i ought to put it up to you .
you all got families at home .
wives , mothers and sweethearts .
i ain' t got no one , so it doesn' t matter about me .
i know how you feel about it .
he actuaily said , " june 4th , " in the hotei griil ?
that place is packed that time of night .
what the heii was he thinking ?
he had too much to drink .
henry miiler is a major general .
entertaining guests with inside knowledge ... ... is a betrayai of the men he commands .
of course .
how' d chapman get onto this ?
a junior officer from the 1 01 st was at the next table .
he contacted his co .
weil , did you speak to the officer ?
yeah .
yeah .
a first iieutenant .
young man from philadelphia .
feels awfui about the thing .
didn' t want to be thought a snitch .
but ?
but he said he commanded a platoon of airborne infantry .
his chances were bad enough without making it easier for the krauts .
then he' s a damn sight better officer than miiler .
and smarter .
henry was a roommate at west point .
one of my closest friends .
you know , the word stayed closed .
no one reaily knows about it .
i do .
at ease .
ike , i' m sorry .
i' m so sorry .
i
i don' t know what got into me .
i do .
i swear , i' ii never touch another drop .
you' re iying .
so , what wiii you do with me ?
what do you think ?
oh , please .
ike , don' t do this to me .
we go back too far .
we' re old friends .
you can' t cut me ioose .
it might be easier if we didn' t have so much history , hank .
but the stakes are way too big .
you' ii have to go home immediately ... ... and you won' t be coming back .
we both owe that to the men who wiii be dead in a few weeks .
i' ii iose my operationai rank .
i' ii go home in disgrace , a major .
you can' t send me home .
you owe me something .
i' m part of the inner circle .
that' s the worst thing you could have said .
there is no inner circle .
only those who wiii iive and those who wiii die .
and you don' t seem to get that .
send him home immediately .
loss of theater rank .
try to keep him a colonei if you can .
and on his record ?
deemed more usefui in hq .
skiils not needed in theater of operation .
the thing about aii the power , beetle ... ... it isn' t the big decisions that weigh heavy .
heil , you can decide to invade russia at dinner .
pick waterloo for battle on a whim .
it' s the details .
the smaii stuff .
it' s easy to gamble a miilion iives .
what' s hard ... ... is to see how that can hurt one single person .
and if you can' t keep that straight ... ... heil ... ... you' ii iose your humanity .
won' t you ?
i couldn' t say , sir .
as you were .
good morning , beetle .
same to you .
i thought you quit smoking .
i' m trying .
ready for the big day ?
it' s the big moment .
anything good in the paper ?
no , not reaily .
it' s stateside , but , hey , it' s three days old .
walter , you' re my chief of staff , not my hq censor .
while ike' s a good administrator and a good organizer ... ... he iacks the military flare of a montgomery ... ... or the audacity of a patton .
yet , for better or worse , he' s the man they caii supreme commander .
you know , ike ... ... a iittle public relations wouldn' t do any harm .
oh , it would , and you know it .
we' re surrounded by some of the biggest sweiled heads in history .
my job is keeping them puiling together in the same direction .
i can' t do that if i' m competing with them for newspaper ink .
this is your plan .
you developed it .
you fought churchiii for it , aii the politicians , even f. d. r.
no , this is your show .
the world ought to know it .
maybe .
one day , but not this day .
this day , we have other fish to fry , general .
now may i have some coffee ?
yes , sir .
oh , a point of principle , old man .
a bad habit in my opinion .
never been permitted in my hq .
oh , aii right , monty , if it' s so damned important to you .
i did agree to use your ground for this .
churchiii makes the finai decision on what they buy .
only him .
but don' t overseil .
he can smeii buii pucky a mile away .
you are acquainted with eisenhower , an american cousin .
yes .
good to see you again .
prime minister teils us we may have great confidence in this undertaking .
oh , i never disagree with mr. churchiil , your majesty .
her majesty queen elizabeth .
how delighted we are to see you again , general .
we iook forward to our private iuncheon next week .
as do i , ma' am .
i thank you .
general , if you please .
excuse me .
your majesties , mr. prime minister ... ... honored guests , dignitaries , i' m dwight eisenhower ... ... commander in chief , supreme headquarters ... ... ailied expeditionary force , european theater of operation .
just getting the title straight is tiring enough .
so i wiii ieave much of today' s business ... ... to my trusted and gifted coileagues , brothers in arms .
we are from different traditions , different services ... ... but we are united in this crusade .
we shaii iiberate europe .
we shaii restore freedom .
we shaii make the world safe for democracy .
there is no other cause so urgent as to bring us so far from our homes .
this is our purpose .
this is operation overlord .
explaining how we wiii succeed is best done by my chiefs of staff ... ... starting with generai montgomery ... ... commander , 2 1 st army group and responsible for aii our iand forces .
general , if you wiil .
your majesties .
of the enemy' s 60 divisions in france , 1 0 are armored .
commanded by erwin rommel .
as you know , i faced him in the desert and bested him .
but make no mistake , rommei is an energetic
clever , putting monty front and center . so he can bring his tanks southward .
but we shaii make a strike forward here .
i hope to make falaise 32 miles inland within 40 hours .
paratroopers wiii totai over 30, 000 men .
the iargest drop in history .
casualties wiii be high ... ... but the size of the force should draw two enemy divisions ... ... from the beaches , just as our men are ready to disembark .
to take the ieft flank ... ... we need to iand enough men to swamp hitler' s atlantic wail .
losses amongst the british and canadian troops ... ... wiii be heavy during the assault wave ... ... but easing off as they move past the piilboxes .
while fighter command provides cover for the beach assault ... ... and strafes the atlantic wail ... ... generai spaatz wiii smash the raii iinks ieading south from la manche ... ... delaying any attempt by rommei to reinforce his southern defenses .
weil , your majesties , gentlemen , there it is .
we' re anxious to hear your thoughts , additions , criticisms .
the floor is open .
i am impressed by the detail ... ... the comprehensiveness of your planning .
but the expected iosses , the sheer carnage ....
i also ache at that thought , your majesty .
i remember my first trip to europe as a young man .
i felt blessed to be here , to see it ... ... to touch the origins of my own country that i love so dearly .
i hoped one day that aii americans would have the same opportunity .
now hundreds of thousands wiil , along with britons and canadians ... ... and european ailies fighting to return home .
this kind of visit isn' t what i had in mind ... ... but if they do not offer the sacrifice of blood now ... ... we wiii aii pay dearly with added gailons iater .
so if some must die ... ... it is in a worthy cause .
i am in this thing with you tiii the very end ... ... and if it fails , we both go down together .
it' s dicey to get out on a iimb with disturbances over baffin island .
if they form a front and move across the north atlantic , this time of year ... ... i' d say six days for a top speed journey ... ... and with the proposed ianding a week away ....
you realize that this may be ... ... the most important weather forecast in history .
i do indeed , sir .
i' d feei a iot more comfortable ... ... if i could have another two days before committing .
the admirai can correct me if i' m wrong ... ... but if we don' t move the men toward the ships ...
... we' re gonna miss the tide , sir .
i' ii be damned if i wait tiii july .
the men wiii go stark raving mad .
june 5 is a go .
issue the movement orders .
weii done .
we' ii do it proud , ike .
i' ii be in falaise in 72 hours , paris by the autumn .
paris in the fail .
bless you , monty .
no one can say you don' t tackle things with two fists .
i admire confidence .
let' s aii get some of that .
aii of you ... ... godspeed .
thank you .
good iuck .
you' re sure this is how you want it , general ?
yes , prime minister .
you see no value to me or president roosevelt ... ... speaking directly to the people of europe ?
not untii the iandings are an assured success .
this way , if it fails , i wiii be the first one to address ... ... the question of the invasion .
you and the president wiii be blameless .
i' m expendable .
you two are not .
shoulder the whole burden alone to the very end , is it ?
one conductor is what i asked for and what you' ve given me .
you' ve made the manly choice .
i admire it .
aii the same , between we two ... ... surely god himself must tremble at the task that iies before you .
and it is god' s work you do , ike ... ... for you hold aii our iives in your hands .
if i do god' s work , then he wiii be at my side , and i cannot fail .
although , candidly , god hasn' t been much help with degauile .
not even god could move him .
and it' s no use iooking to me .
degauile hates me .
he ignores that france is coilaborating with the enemy .
pretends vichy doesn' t exist and jews aren' t being rounded up .
a horrid man ... ... but he guards french prerogatives jealously .
take another run at him , ike .
i' ii back any bargain you strike .
would you just assure me of one thing ?
the sands on these norman beaches ... ... dense enough for tanks ?
you can drink to it , sir .
once more ... ... unto the breach , dear friends .
once more ... ... or close the wall up with our english dead .
in peace , there' s nothing so becomes a man ... ... as modest stillness and humility .
but when the blast of war blows in our ears , then imitate the tiger .
do you get the feeling europeans ... ... have been at this war thing for a iong time ?
too iong .
it' s almost as if they iike war .
i am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle .
how can they charitably dispose ... ?
sounds iike shakespeare had it aii figured out .
yeah .
but he was writing after the war was over and won .
it' s spooky ... ... iistening to words written 400 years ago about our battlefields .
words about blood and grief .
very spooky .
but if i may , ours is not to reason why .
of course it is .
we' re the generals .
i think monty' s got churchiii worried that the beaches won' t hold the tanks .
i' ve told you a hundred times , we' ve done our homework .
the sand wiii support the tank track rails with ease .
i don' t think that' s what' s bothering you .
you read marshail' s ietter .
about the paratroopers ?
yes , i did .
what' d you make of it ?
he' s wrong .
he says drop the jumpers behind the beaches .
try to draw the germans in two directions .
if i were rommel , i' d ignore them .
concentrate everything on the beach .
i' d do the same .
every hour i delay the invasion force from moving in ... ... would be another hour airborne units would be isolated .
exactly .
besides , i need those men ... ... aii 30, 000 of them , to keep nipping at the krauts ' heels .
they have to be close to force rommei to deai with them .
yeah , but the drop zones , brad .
you heard leigh mailory' s estimate of iosses with a close drop .
carnage .
how would a distant drop be better ?
if inland progress was slow , we' d have those men ... ... wandering around france iooking for something to eat .
we' d be repeating the mistake we made in anzio .
marshail' s a godfather to us , brad .
i hate to cross the old man .
one supreme commander , one voice .
we few , we happy few , we band of brothers .
for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother ... ... be he ne' er so base .
and gentlemen in england , now abed ... ... shall think themselves accursed they were not here ... ... and hold their manhoods cheap while any speaks ... ... that fought with us upon st. crispin' s day !
my sovereign lord ....
i hope the main attraction' s a bit more cheerful .
it' s rita hayworth .
a heii of a iot easier on the eye than that bunch .
i' ve been in the theater years and never seen
excuse me , please .
why don' t you be a good boy and scram .
of course , we' il go  no , that' s all right .
you' re welcome to stay here , but this guy
this guy .
i' m sorry .
that' s my one virtue .
mcguire .
hello .
i' m sorry .
it' s a little crowded here .
would you mind moving over ?
oh , that' s quite all right .
make yourself at home .
dearest mamie ... ... at last , the days grow longer , and we will soon be in it .
i face that with neither dread nor joy .
how i wish this cruel business of war could be completed quickly .
it leaves me heartsick to think of sending so many men ... ... against hitler' s atlantic wall .
i admit to having developed a veneer of callousness ... ... but counting the human cost is a terribly sad business ... ... and no veneer of callousness allows me to escape the truth ... ... that back home , the news brings anguish and suffering .
so many youngsters already gone forever .
mothers , fathers , brothers ... ... sisters back home have a difficult time ... ... retaining any belief in the eternal rightness of things .
there is no true glory in war .
yes , sir .
at 0900 .
yes .
inteiligence signals confirm rommei moved the 1 1 6th panzer division ... ... basing at verviile .
that is shouting distance from the main drops .
is it a single redeployment or part of iarger movement ?
so far , just a one shot affair , but he bypassed juno , sword and gold ... ... and sent them directly to utah and omaha .
that doesn' t change my view .
we have to have the airborne as close as possible .
i need jumpers breathing down the germans ' necks ... ... puiling them around .
the plan always cailed for the diversion to be
i know !
i know .
you' re new here .
what' s your name ?
corporai wiiliam younger , ma' am .
aii right , now remember , we hear nothing in this room .
and we never speak .
no matter what , we never stop work .
the king himself may enter , but what we' re doing must take priority .
now carry on .
they deserve a force at the krauts '  stop .
i know the risks for both sides ... ... but neither of you makes a decisive case .
how many ways can i say it ?
i' m counting on those jumpers to split german attention ... ... ease pressure on the assault wave .
and they should have , but that was before rommei redeployed .
one division isn' t a redeployment .
for men in my drop , it' s a potentiai disaster .
jumpers and glider borne troops are sitting ducks ... ... for the first 1 0 minutes untii they regroup .
damn .
there goes another .
it' s the 81 st infantry .
wehrmacht , conscripts , the crack units are to the north .
perhaps .
but if jerry' s reinforcing the whole damn region ... ... we iose 70 percent of glider troops before they' re out of planes .
and the jumpers ?
some of them wiii make it , but they' ii be short of the numbers you need ... ... if seaborne iandings are depending on airborne to distract jerry .
you' re saying there' s no middle ground .
we should cancei it .
we don' t want the slaughter of two fine divisions .
the 1 01 st and the 82nd are elite , ike .
we' ii need them down the iine .
we' ii need them on june 5th .
otherwise the entire german army ... ... wiii iet ioose on my assault waves .
my ioss wiii be 70 percent .
aii right .
thank you .
i' ve heard both sides .
i need a night to sleep on it .
sorry to disturb , sir .
may i ?
if it' s good news .
weil , sir , i wish i could say it was ... ... but it' s getting a iittle bit uncertain .
you said it would take days for systems ... ... to get from baffin island to here .
and so it should , sir .
unless they dislodge from the jet stream ... ... a meteorologicai possibility , they' re not
i can' t work with possibilities , group captain .
at minimum , i need probabilities .
are there such things as meteorologicai probabilities ?
there wiii be , sir , within hours .
not fast enough , group captain .
i need hourly reports .
yes , sir .
he doesn' t make weather .
he talks about it .
then get him to say nicer things .
look , give me some time to work on this airborne thing .
i' ii send for you when i' ve figured it out .
yes .
what is it ?
our friends at hq say the airborne decision is at a head .
if you' re to be heard , now would be the hour , sir .
and what do you think , wiatt ?
inland , they' re no help to the ianding force .
keep them close , they could be shredded .
let' s see how he works it out .
thank you , wiatt .
if i may ... ... it' s the right decision .
divisionai commanders can' t factor in weather and the seas ... ... supplies , navai support , degauile , the politics .
besides , it' s not their job .
i' ii inform leigh mailory and brad .
don' t publish that order untii i do .
you better get some sleep .
you have another dragon to slay tomorrow .
i' ve considered it .
either way , some units wiii sustain devastating iosses .
but this invasion is iargely dependent on sea and air power .
our iand troops are inferior ... ... if for no other reason than they' re not on iand .
so our most important job is securing beachheads .
deference must be given to protecting troops trying to come ashore ... ... to clear the way for the armor and artiilery that wiii push rommei back .
that being the case , despite the projected iosses , traff ... ... even 70 percent , the airborne operation has to go .
it' s the toughest choice i' ve ever had to make .
do everything to diminish the hazards .
go over every detaii a thousand times .
but as painfui as it is , those soldiers wiii have to bear the rough portion .
generai bradley' s assault troops must be given every edge we can find .
a perfectly sound decision .
we' ii keep jerry watching out for his backside .
you get yours to those jumpers as soon as you can .
count on it .
thank you , gentlemen .
brad ?
when he wakes up , i' m seeing churchiil .
he' s gonna bring it up  wiii you iay off ?
i' ve told you , the sand wiii hold .
we tested with iight bombing .
resistance gave measurements .
i know .
if the first of those storms hits the beaches the same time we do ... ... you' re iooking at 2 inches of rain .
maybe 20 foot sweils , eating at the beaches .
huge erosion .
would you stiii go in that kind of weather ?
if we don' t go now ....
a iot can happen in three weeks .
they' d get onto us .
rommei can move more men .
so i ask you again , my good friend , what if the conditions are marginal ?
the beaches wiii be firm .
i know they wiil .
you can trust me on this and not worry yourself about it further .
thank you , general .
general .
salute !
attention !
thank you for taking the time to join us , general .
not even your headman' s kansas charm can melt the french iceberg .
don' t bet on it .
attention , aii ranks !
generai officer !
as you were .
come , general .
let me provide you with some details .
prime minister .
if the frenchman can back up his manner ... ... he should be able to controi the weather for us .
and the tides .
aii we want is he teils the french to welcome us .
neutrality might mean they' ii work against us ... ... iike some did at dunkirk .
my , my .
seems that our work isn' t up to the general' s ievel .
generai degauile , i trust your confidence is buoyed .
i think your operation overlord is poorly conceived .
i have explained its failures to generai eisenhower .
he has aii the information to make the necessary corrections .
i' m gratefui for the general' s contributions .
i' ii explain them to you aii iater .
although , as i' ve told the general , with regret ... ... we simply don' t have the time to make the changes suggested .
perhaps ... ... you could use a moment alone ... ... to discuss other matters ?
yes , sir .
general ?
what do you expect from me , general ?
this is , after ail , your speech .
yes .
but it is to be broadcast to the french people on the eve of their iiberation .
i was hoping for your support since we recognize you ... ... as their iegitimate voice .
of course you do .
there is no one else .
so i shaii give my own address when the time comes .
as , of course , you must .
but it is our hope , our urgent hope ... ... that you' ii endorse my remarks ... ... and that is why my speech should concern you .
your remarks concern me greatly , generai eisenhower .
but not for the reasons you might iike .
okay , what' s wrong with it ?
firstly , you urge frenchmen to foilow your orders ?
only i wiii command the people of france .
i understand that .
we aii do .
but this operation can only work if it speaks with one voice .
so they say .
you even ask my people to accept ailied money .
yet , as president of the provisionai government , only i can issue currency .
you say iocai administrations wiii stay in place .
for stability , general .
only i shaii decide what to do with vichy officials .
no , no .
it' s quite impossible .
i' ii never accept ... ... that you can speak for aii the ailies .
the british have .
the canadians , the australians , the exiled dutch and poles .
roosevelt and churchiii have agreed .
come to think of it , you' re the only exception .
you wiii not treat us iike italy .
we are not german ailies .
in fact , the vichy government is precisely that , general .
but we wiii iiberate france and treat her as an aily nonetheless .
aii i ask is that you speak on the radio after my address ... ... and caii on your people to aid us in their iiberation .
speak after you ?
impossible .
that would imply i approve of your program .
i understand .
ailow me to see you to your car .
you' re wet , stagg .
aye , sir .
it started raining .
i find that very depressing .
depressing .
yes .
weil , three depressions , actuaily .
one after the other .
they roiled in from baffin island in unbelievably quick time .
i' ve never seen it iike  how iong before they pass through ?
aii three ?
yes .
three to five days .
might be some calm in between them .
meantime , we' re iooking at sweils of up to 40 feet mid channel ... ... 30 feet breakers on the ianding zones ... ... and winds of up to 50 miles an hour .
we can' t get the gliders and c 4 7 s off the ground .
even if we did , they' d be blown aii over europe when they jumped .
embarkation status , birdie ?
crew' s aboard ship , vessel' s fuily ioaded .
mulberries and lst is fueled .
more crafts stiii at mooring .
c 4 7 s in place .
gliders ieashed .
men ready for boarding on 30 minutes ' notice .
we can' t send them .
they' ii drown before they arrive .
true enough .
some wiil .
but we have to calculate the margins .
this might work to our advantage .
it' s certain jerry won' t expect an invasion force in this weather .
of course , it is up to you .
but with aii the goodwiii in the world ...
... we can' t wait forever .
no .
but we can wait one more day .
we owe the men that .
disembarkation is delayed 2 4 hours to tuesday .
we meet at 01 30 hours tomorrow morning to finalize .
sir , there' s a definite break almost immediately at hand .
what kind of break ?
this dreadfui torrent that seems ... ... ready to wash us away wiii iift in three hours or so .
for how iong ?
what' s off the irish coast ?
a nasty iow .
but even at top speed ... ... it would need 36 hours to reach the normandy coast .
meanwhile , winds wiii moderate .
the bombers should be able to operate starting tomorrow ... ... and right into june 6th .
at best , a moderately good night for drop zones .
for air power , generaily .
heavy and medium bombers wiii find the going , weil , chancy at best .
true , but we could press our entire force of bombers into service .
they' d operate weii in these conditions .
yes .
i expect they would .
but if stagg could give us a iarger window on the 7th
i' d take comfort in that .
i' m not ready to give up on the 6th , stagg .
sir .
would you know more by 0200 hours , son ?
i expect we' d have a better sense of the speed ... ... of the next storm' s approach .
yes .
i' m afraid that' s not good enough , old man .
the american force has the iongest sea journey .
now , they must put to sea in the next half hour ... ... if overlord' s to happen on the 6th .
and further , if you have admirai kirk set saii then recaii his fleet ... ... for worsening weather , he can' t refuel .
won' t be ready in time for the 7th .
too iate after that .
tides and moon won' t be in the right alignment on the 8th .
any reason we shouldn' t go on the 6th , monty ?
i would say go .
one heii of a gamble to go now .
very chancy .
i know .
the question is , how iong can we hang this operation ... ... on the end of a iimb and just iet it dangle there ?
i' m quite positive the order must be given .
signai wiii go to the fleet immediately , sir .
we meet again at 0400 hours for a report on their progress .
that' ii be our iast chance to hold off tiii july .
finaily going as i predicted , sir .
the break is almost upon us .
long range forecast stiii unpleasant ... ... but i can promise the weather wiii clear in a matter of hours .
gentlemen .
i command you ... ... but you command the men i' m about to throw into battle .
one iast go round , please .
weil , they' re almost in the channel .
the weather front is moving faster than the ships .
by the time the lsts reach iandfail , sea shaii be calm .
i say , no turning back .
agreed .
a dark day for airborne , i' m afraid .
weil , if there is to be a recail , it must be now .
let' s go .
sixth airborne k 1 2 !
stand by , signal .... 89 7 7 in the wing .
last one at the dance ?
or the first ?
heil , that' s just the way it is , beetle .
one minute i' m exactly what churchiii described ... ... the most powerfui man in history .
now the order' s given .
heil , i' m just audience .
front row , center , to be sure .
but a corporai on juno , a private on utah ... ... they' re the ones who wiii affect the outcome , not me .
it' s up to them now .
yes , sir .
aii right .
gather around .
ten minutes to onload .
just enough time for a visitor .
the supreme commander himself is coming to see us off .
no kidding .
heil , i' ii bet he ain' t coming with , boys .
it' s not his job .
besides , he hasn' t earned his jump wings .
aii right .
here' s the protocol .
do not speak unless spoken to .
if he asks you a question ... ... you' ii find that generals are not interested in the personal .
where you trained , where you did jump school .
what kind of medals and ribbons you' ve earned .
stuff iike that .
aii right ?
seven out of 1 0 , beetle .
maybe more .
in god' s hands , sir .
at ease .
gather around .
that' s an order , jumpers .
smoke them if you got them .
where you from , son ?
basic at dix , jumped at bragg , sir .
corporal , i asked where you' re from .
you had a iife before the army , didn' t you ?
you bet i did , sir .
i' m a chicago boy .
southside .
good for you .
how about you ?
where you from ?
new orleans , sir .
nebraska , sir .
go corn huskers .
that' s the wrong team , jumper .
anybody here from kansas ?
i' m from kansas , sir .
go get them , jayhawks .
you bet .
look out , hitler .
here we come .
yeah !
aii ready , then ?
yes , sir .
no , we ain' t worried , general .
it' s the krauts that ought to be worrying now .
excuse me , sir .
do you have a iight ?
yes , i do , iieutenant .
thank you , sir .
our landings on the french coast have failed ... ... to gain a satisfactory foothold , and i have withdrawn the troops .
my decision to attack at this time and place was based upon ... ... the best information available .
if any blame or fault attaches to the attempt , it is mine alone .
if it aii goes wrong , if overlord fails ... ... give that to the press .
of course , overlord did not fail .
how could it ?
with so many fine young men and women from all corners of the earth ... ... all determined to do their best to free a world gone half mad .
there would be setbacks .
there would be small triumphs , even in the first few hours .
a message from leigh mailory .
read it .
urgent .
sir , it is at times difficult to admit one is wrong .
but i have the great pleasure in doing so on this occasion .
casualties are dramaticaily below my estimates .
i congratulate you on your command decision ... ... and apologize for adding to the supreme commander' s worries .
leigh mailory .
any numbers ?
early estimates ... ... about 20 percent .
carry on , general .
sir .
twenty percent is so much better than 7 0 .
but the loss of even one of this gallant band is a loss ... ... to all decent humanity everywhere .
and besides , if the person killed in action is you or the one you love ... ... then the odds are 1 00 percent in that case .
they knew that , these great crusaders .
but they went anyway .
too many of them are now with god .
we may never see their like again .
we may never see their like again .
