go straight to the office ...
don' t dawdle on the way
don' t worry
i' il call in 30 minutes to check
oh , hello fujio

it' s no fun listening to women' s talk
well , why don' t we go in together ?
i' m fine out here

if she' s not out soon , i' m leaving !
i' il tell her
mrs. ishino has arrived

welcome
please come in
i hope you' re well
been here long ?
a little while
you' re very pretty , today
you look stunning , today
today you' re really beautiful
what' s with the ' " today today ' " ?
she always thinks she' s beautiful
cheeky !
that' s a lovely wrap !
you' re being sarcastic
you bought it at mitsukoshi ?
no , is it too earthy ?
earthy ?
you don' t feel it is ?
how old are you ?
old enough
terrible , terrible
what' s so funny ?
isn' t that it ?
perhaps you' re right
getting a lot of lines recently
grows older ?
you don' t have to spell it out
only when laughing , though
i' ve tried it in front of the mirror
see , no lines that time ?
isn' t there ?
let' s hear it again
reminds one of a zoo
cheeky !
gotta give it up
fujio is tired of waiting
you' d better leave
can you solve this ?
what ?
if you have thirty two 5 sen and 1 sen coins ...
and you' re short 2 sen on a bill of 130
how many of each denomination did you have ?
what is it ?
fujio' s homework , from yesterday
he' s starting junior high this year
the preliminaries are so complicated
and if i can' t do the work he' s been set ...
it kept me up till 2 a .
m
working on this ?
yes .
go on , solve it
thirty two 5 sen and 1 sen coins ...
2 sen short on a bill of 130
forget it .
it' s our cross to bear
wait .
if you call it x ...
you can' t do it like that !
no using algebra
a total of 32 coins ...
and no using real coins !
right !
i' ve got it !
it just takes patience no , that' s wrong too
you don' t have to get upset about it
they don' t do this in junior
if you could do it you' d say they do
couldn' t the doctor find me a tutor ?
perhaps from among his students
i simply can' t do it myself please ask him
you worry too much
i don' t really care who just so long as he' s clean
you' re just after a fredrick march type
that would be lovely
please , i' m serious
i' il keep my eyes open
don' t forget , will you ?
please , for fujio' s sake
you' re leaving ?

my niece from osaka arrives here tomorrow
it' il be good to see her again
i like the girl

noodles ?

hello , i' m just testing now
it looks bad for you
you' il never have children
tidy this up , please
sir , it' s time for your class
which room ?
number 27
okada !
the book i ordered has arrived
can you bring it to my place ?
' " salmonella was rife in the town of frankenhausen '
when dr. gartner discovered the baccilus name ... ... after him in 1888
the mode of infection is yet to be discovered
but a detectable relationship ... ... has been established with the spirochette ... ... of the encephalitic bacterium which reaches epidemic proportions
nowadays , what we call encephalitis ... ... was identified by a dr. ekonomo in vienna in 1919
whether the tow are the same or not is still a matter of speculation
looking beyond these questions ... ... at dr. ekonomo' s diagnosis of lethargic encephalitis ...
like our friend here there' s no evidence it attacks during winter
so he doesn' t have it
ready ?
going back to the original question ...
setsuko !
setsuko !
no , i' m actually very good
i can drive at 60 kph on route 2
it' s such a good feeling
you want to come along ?
no thanks
your family doesn' t object ?
i see , but it sounds dangerous
you see , i' m the best road racer
shall i show you ?
so here' s where you are
i' m talking to uncle
first put your bags away
she' s learning to drive
drive ?
there' il be none of that in tokyo !
restrict your accidents to osaka , please
you smoke ?
yes , i do
it' s bad for you !
but you smoke !
put it out .
you' re still a minor
i' il just finish it off
setsuko !
mind you wash behind your ears , young lady
are they dirty ?
clean them for me
ugh !
how dirty !
master okada is here
good day
please come in
am i intruding ?
not at all .
this is our niece
setsuko , mr. okada
i owe a lot to your uncle
sir , i brought your book
good lad .
sit down
it' s alright .
please
it' s alright .
please
how' d you like to be a tutor ?
what subject ?
arithmetic .
exam preparations
for fujio
in junior high , already ?
will you ?
but children and i ...
it' d be easy for you .
please do it
but the doctor ...
he approves , don' t you ?
then it' s settled ?
you' il do it ?
good !
but mrs. komiya ...
it' s been decided
thanks a lot !
you' re stuck with it
seems so
area of the sea is 3 times that of the land 3/ 4 of which is in the northern hemisphere
how many times is the area of the sea in relation to land in the northern hemisphere ?
how many times ...
well , that' s ...
3/ 4 of the sea is in the n. h ...
wait , i just have the thing !
it' s easy when you use this
that' s a good idea !
3/ 4 of the area ...
ethiopia' s over here
how many times is the area of the sea in relation to land
come in .
hello
studying ?
did you get question three ?
how does it go ?
the earth' s area becomes 1 , then land area equals 1/ 4
so land in the n. h. is ...
1/ 4 times 3/ 4 = 3/ 16
therefore , the area of the sea ... understand ?
1/ 2 minus 3/ 16
where' d you get the half ?
this ?
by calling the area 1 ...
the n. h. becomes one half
oh , really ?
so the equation is 5/ 16
that' s the sea area
so 5/ 16 divided by 3/ 16 ... ... is 1 and 2/ 3 , that' s the answer
yes !
that' s right !
where' d you graduate from ?
the university
you did graduate ?
yes , i did
junior high , too ?
yes .
and you studied arithmetic ?
of course
so we' ve nothing to worry about
so it seems
er ...
ma' am ...
setsuko ?
please come in
hello
it' s been a while .
come in
everything' s fine ?
yes , thank you .
you always look good
you too , you look younger every time i see you
your flattery has improved
i mean it
your aunt' s not coming
no , but i remembered you like these
thank you very much
this is from aunty

how did it go ?
about 33 34
that' s quite big
i got quite good but i gave it up
i got callouses and didn' t really have time
because i' m studying classical voice
so you sing ' " kiyomoto ' " ?
yes and my teacher praised my rendition of ' " ochudo '
is that so ?
you' re not golfing today ?
i have to work on this so i won' t go today
really ?
you still here ?
do you know the time ?
i' m pondering whether or not to go
why ?
you must go the exercise is good for you
i' m going out for a while
setsuko , i want you to stay until i get back
uncle , are you going ?
looks like i have to
then i' il be here alone
well , someone has to stay
okada !
professor , please come in .
hullo

no , and i' d like to stay here overnight
stay ?
here , sir ?
will i bother you ?
no , please do
and say nothing to my wife
i' m going out for a while
yes , sir
to a bar in the ginza why don' t you join me later ?
the doctor is late today
you always seem to wait for him
you know why they call this ' " dimple ' " ?

you' re not just kidding me ?
no , truly
welcome
you' re late
i' m sorry

my wife thinks i should play on saturdays

to your wife ?
i always send her one
i see
so what' il you do today ?
well , you know ...
know what ?
madame , he' s picking up the tab today
it' s not what you think
then why don' t you pay ?
and you , beware of the bunkers !
that was just a bad day for me
i think i' m getting a cold
you should be careful
a good looking man
who is he ?
that' s mr. uehara
mr. uehara ?
i thought all the girls knew him from kanagawa
oh , that uehara
where are your clubs ?
i left them at a friend' s
a lady friend ?
don' t be silly
uncle !
setsuko , what' s this ?
how did you find me here ?
a lucky guess .
you' re a good man
it' s terrible that she makes you go play golf
that almost made me despise you
what are you drinking ?
i' il have the same
fix me one , please
you shouldn' t be drinking
don' t worry
you' il get drunk
come on
i can handle 2 or 3 with ease
i' d like to visit a tokyo geisha house
what ?
please take me
you' re not returning home tonight , are you ?
come on !
let' s go
well done
you want another one ?
i' ve had plenty
what a bore !
setsuko , you' ve had enough
leave me alone

thank you
tokyo geisha , you have real class
thank you
good to see you , professor
tonight again .
you' re here with a beautiful young lady
my niece .
she' s bubbling with vigour
a rare beauty
thank you
please enjoy yourselves !
thank you very much
uncle ?
you never tire
so it seems
may i see it
i really like it .
do you want to swap ?
don' t mind , it' s alright !
but yours is so ...
never mind , take it please
i' ve taken a shine to yours
it' s time we were leaving
i don' t want to leave yet
i can sleep here tonight
come on , we' re going
you have to get back
but my head hurts so
why such a hurry ?
setsuko !
we' re leaving !
we' ve got to get you home
can you carry me ?
i' m supposed to be golfing
it just can' t be helped !
please call okada at this number
tell him to come at once
no !
i' il stay here
fumiya !
you never answer me !
setsuko' s late .
when did she go out ?
about four o' clock
and it' s past 1 am !
should i go and look for her ?
no idea where she' s gone , so where would you look ?
she' s back , ma' am
i' m back
still up ?
where' ve you been ?
around
you' ve been drinking !
a drop or two
such a troublesome girl !
setsuko !
come here !
sit down !
don' t go getting upset
you' re not supposed to drink
you' re still a minor !
now sit down !
don' t worry !
setsuko !
wake up , young lady !
i said wake up !
where' ve you been out drinking until this hour ?
setsuko
i was fast asleep
felt good .
don' t want to hear anymore
what if something happened while he' s away at golf ?
you' re our responsibility !
i' ve been worried sick !
you could help by getting me a glass of water
setsuko !
quickly !
ma' am , the car that brought her home ...
with mr. okada ?
was it raining when you got up ?
i wonder when it started ?
probably around dawn
i hadn' t reckoned on that
we were due for a change
they' re cooked , sir !
thanks !
it' s really pelting down
it certainly is !
that' s not good
what do you mean , sir ?
i sent a postcard saying the weather was fine
a friend posted it from the golf course
he should realise he' s not that kind of man
really , sir ?
that is a problem
it' s not joking matter
you think it rained in izu ?
i can' t tell
nationwide , don' t you think ?
that is a problem
they' re done , sir !
fumiya ?
is aunty home ?
home all day ?
she has no plans to go out
fumiya
fumiya
coming !
where' s setsuko ?
in her room
she' s not to go out
sure
the master is back
welcome back
to unseasonable weather
how did it go ?
just so so
by the way ...
i' m angry with setsuko
soon as you left , she was out the door !
carousing until one o' clock !
came home dead drunk !
drunk , you say ?
she treated me with contempt !
and didn' t listen to a word i said
she came back with young okada
with okada ?
if anything happens while she' s in our care ...
you have a point there
i want you to lay down the rules to her
right !
send her to my room !
you uncle wants a word with you
uncle !
ah , setsuko !
i need a favour
yes ?
the postcard i had sent ...
i don' t want your aunt to see it
why not ?
i wrote that the weather was fine
just leave it to me will
you' ve been at okada' s all this time ?
yes
i' ve got a terrible hangover
aunty' s in a terrible rage
she' s said barely a word to me all day
it was bad luck she found out okada' s role in this
fumiya saw us together
and she' s taken it the wrong way
i wouldn' t mind if he were at least handsome
understand !
look at me !
don' t go gazing away !
on your feet , young lady !
i' m telling you for your own good
when you go out , you tell us where you' re going !
and you can' t stay out late !
you should know better !
remember what he says , young lady !
you understand ?
and pay heed to what your aunt tells you !
you hear me ?
what a good liar !
i' m surprised
but ...
you' re good and okada and i are never right !
this time you' ve no excuse
and pay particular heed to what your aunty says
you understand ?
that wasn' t her .
it was the wind how stupid !
professor , this is very hard on me
she got very angry with me
said i betrayed her trust and barred me from the house
she misunderstood and it' s more than i can bear
sir , please explain
sir , i' m begging you
i considered telling her the truth
you' re right , but please just bear with it
i' il return the favour one day .
please ?
i let him have a piece of my mind
i introduced him to you but now i wash my hands off him
he seems so upright , a lad of morals
what is it ?
i' m embarrassed to say it
say what ?
what ?
you are
but we' ve been married for 14 years
congratulations !
it' s nothing to be ashamed of
even hippos have babies
stupid !
dr. komiya could attend to you
i' d be indebted for life if he did
your husband will be thrilled
he' s sick in bed , now
since when ?
how' s your husband ?
why do you ask ?
well , playing golf in the rain
rain ?
that' s strange ...
' " weather' s fine ' " , ' " great for golf '
that is strange
the master has returned
uncle , something dreadful has happened
she read the postcard !
i thought i' d get to it first she' s certainly fast
dear !
you played golf with sugiyama ?
apparently it rained
what' s the meaning of ' " great for golf ' " ?
aunty , forget it
you shut up !
it doesn' t matter if it rained or not
you shut up !
out , get out of the room !
out !
now !
isn' t it strange ?
the same golf course and he gets wet ... you bathed in the sunshine
if it rains the weather is certainly not ' " fine '
' " great for golf ' " , did it rain all around you ?
he got bad cold
can you explain how that happened ?
can you tell me why ?
your guests are leaving
you should see them off
i' il get to the bottom of this
i' m hungry
ask for eel .
they do wonders with it
why the hurry to leave ?
stay a little longer
why don' t you take your time ?
i was going to order eel , your favorites
yes , but ...
you' il leave ?
see you soon
fumiya , our guests are leaving !
fumiya !
fumiya !
don' t forget
the master ?
he left through the garden
that was close .
they barely made it
your aunt is fuming !
don' t worry about it !
are you really frightened of her ?
not what you' d call frightened
then why so glum ?
drink up
you worry too much about her
that' s why she walks all over you
i' m just the niece .
you' re the husband !
the master !
if it were me , i' d tell her !
fickle like the weather i' d make her change !
but ...
i couldn' t
you can , you just don' t
want to go to the geisha house ?
i' il pay
uncle , let' s go
uncle .
doctor !
let' s go !
welcome home !
where' ve you been ?
setsuko !
where did you go ?
where ?
you' ve been drinking again !
i told you before !
what have you two been up to ?
setsuko !
answer me !
speak up !
say something !
we went for a walk
setsuko !
i' ve had enough of you !
enough !
back to osaka !
she doesn' t have to
you shut up !
out !
go home !
not at your command
i' il go when i' m ready !
what ?
you put her up to this !
that' s why she' s so insolent
you' re the insolent one !
i treat you well and you try to walk all over me
just think a little
if she doesn' t want to go , she doesn' t have to
well done !
she needed that that made me feel good
i' il sleep well tonight
i' il go to bed , goodnight !
aunty !
i was very rude
please forgive me !
it just slipped out
it all became so complicated
of course he' s wrong , too
he didn' t play golf that day
perhaps i shouldn' t say this
but sometimes he doesn' t want to
he stayed the night at okada' s place
before that , he was with me
i' m sorry i drank and made a fool of myself and made you worry
forgive me !
i was wrong
so of course you' re right to be angry with me
but i feel sorry for uncle
i was wrong and i ask for your forgiveness
you weren' t wrong
so you don' t have to say sorry .
but ...
please forgive me !
i' m sorry for what i did
i couldn' t control myself ... but hitting you was wrong
you have a right to be angry , but forgive me
it was very wrong of me
no , i made a mess
she said you stayed at okada' s instead of going to golf
well ... yes
you believe me ?
i didn' t know so i just assumed the worst
i didn' t have a chance to tell the truth
okada came out worst of all
i' m grateful you understand me i' m sorry !
i' m truly sorry
well ... goodnight !
dear ... !
why the funny face ? !
uncle !
what is it ?
i covered for you
there was no need for you to apologise , too ?
she had to
you started out well but finished terribly
let' s see it again !
the man should be stronger
that was sufficient
not at all
that' s something you don' t understand yet
some men treat their wives badly
but that' s not a good thing
wives should be respected
they like to think they' re in control so it' s better to let them think that ...
like scolding children by praising them
that' s the best way , the opposite approach
opposite approach ?
i' ve never thought about that
i' ve have to remember that
i would like to see that
a real hard one ?
how many times ?
once .
where ?
across the face
a good solid whack ?
yes
did it hurt ?
not really ... no !
my husband' s a wimp , not so much as a love tap
with a face a like that ...
fool !
you think it' il suit him ?
too colorful
what ?
he' s still young
i' il get one , too
sorry for you , no one to buy for
what about fujio ?
stupid
when' s setsuko leaving ?
we' re eating out tonight and she' il leave from there to take the 9pm express
you should' ve brought her along with us
but she' s out shopping with okada
' " opposite approach ' " ?
i didn' t know , myself we' re both a couple of fools
don' t use it when we marry
no , i' d never
you probably will
i' m the straightforward type
flattery will get you nowhere
if you do , i' il use the ' " opposite opposite ' " approach
when are you coming again ?
for the college baseball match
i' m a waseda fan
i like waseda , too
flattering again sounds like ' " opposite '
this time tomorrow , i' il be in osaka
i wonder where she is by now ?
around numazu , i guess
she' s probably fast asleep
probably
the house seems very lonely with her away
she' il come again , soon
it' d be nice to have her come often
yes
would you like a coffee ?
i won' t be able to sleep
you' il sleep well
fumiya !
goodnight !
