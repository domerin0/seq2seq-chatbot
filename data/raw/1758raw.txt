just because you' ve hit 30 doesn' t mean ... you can' t be fresh anymore .
uh huh .
you know ... joy , i' ve never told you this before ... ... but now that we' re older , and ... ... l feel so bonded to you ... ... well ... the ... the truth is ...
i know this is going to sound horrible ... but i just feel i have to be fully open with you and just ... ... get beyond all the old barriers , and the sibling nonsense you know i ...
oh , well , the truth is i always thought you would never amount to much .
that you' d end up alone , without a career or anything .
you know ...
really , it' s what we all thought .
mom , dad , helen ... everyone ...
i' d always prayed we' d all be wrong , but ... some how you always just seemed so ... doomed to failure .
but now i see , that' s not true .
there' s a glimmer of hope for you after all .
but i' m sorry , i know i' m repeating myself ...
i' m just really happy for you .
oh ... trish .
and how is this different
i don' t kill myself at the end .
do you see this as something positive ?
gee , well ... l ... l don' t know .
how do you feel at the end ?
much better .
i wake up ... happy ... feeling good ... but then i get very depressed because i' m ...
iiving in reality .
and what about your family .
trish is good to me .
but ... still no sex .
no . but she' s not too interested either , so really ... there' s no problem there ... when you think about it ... ... on a certain level .
mom

so anyway ... joy came by today .
how' s she doing ?
oh , god , i dunno , and frankly ...
i' m concemed .
i mean , she' s not like me .
you know she doesn' t " have it all " .
she pretends to be happy , but i can see right through her , she' s miserable .
why do you think that is ?
well to be frank , i think she' s lazy .
she' s not a go getter , like me or helen .
and she' s so picky .
i gave damien ross her phone number , for what it' s worth , and ...
joy sounded interested , naturally , but ... l dunno .
i' m afraid i have to say it , but truly its what i believe ... ... she' il always be alone .
we' re all alone .

don' t you think so , bill ?
i don' t know .
don' t you think that' s a little harsh ?
i mean if it' s not affecting her work
well, apparently it is .
and no , in fact , i don' t think it' s a little harsh at all .
i' m sorryu , but when it come to drug abuse ... and children , my children ...
uch , they should all just be locked up and throw away the key .
and billy , i want you to know something , if you ever even t think of doing drugs , and end up dying in a hospital ... l' d disown you .
that' s how strongly i feel about it .
