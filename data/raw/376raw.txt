i have long feared ... ... that my sins would return to visit me .
and the cost is more than i can bear .
samuel !
a postrider !
an " r " .
good .
what about this one ?
thank you .
you' re welcome .
father !
father !
nine pounds , eleven ounces .
that' s perfect .
perfect .
father , a postrider !
did you finish planting the field ?
more than half .
those swimming breaks really cut into the day , don' t they ?
told you .
thomas .
wait for father .
sorry .
that' s her .
the north star .
see ?
you start from the front two stars of the big dipper .
and then you count up .
you count up five finger lengths ... ... and it' s right there .
and she' il always be looking down on us .
and protect us .
forever .
come .
into bed .
good night .
good night , meg .
it helps her to know mother' s there .
good night .
so what was in the mail ?
peter cuppin joined the continentals .
he' s 1 7 , a year younger than i.
well , the assembly' s been convened , so i' ve been called to charles town .
we' re going to charles town ?
we are .
we leave in the morning .
aunt charlotte !
margaret , william , look at you .
missed you .
they' re huge .
what have you been feeding them ?
well , they' re from good stock .
on their mother' s side , of course .
thank you .
come inside .
wait until you see what i have .
presents ?
presents for us ?
move slowly .
keep an eye on these heathens , will you ?
sorry .
i have this for you , susan .
it belonged to your mother .
she' s still not talking ?
no .
it does me good to see you .
look , there' s gabriel .
hang king george !
death to king george !
hang them all !
hang the lot of them !
my name is peter howard .
i lost most of my hearing and my left leg ... ... fighting for the crown in the french and indian war .
and how did king george reward me ?
he cuts off my other leg with his taxes .
miss howard , isn' t it ?
you know who i am , gabriel martin .
the last time you saw me , i was 1 1 and you put ink in my tea .
i believe that was one of my younger brothers .
perhaps samuel or nathan .
it was you , and it turned my teeth black for a month .
and send a message to king george he will never forget !
our first order of business
and our last , if we vote a levy !
order , order !
mr. simms , you do not have the floor .
first , an address by colonel harry burwell of the continental army .
colonel burwell .
you all know why i' m here .
i' m not an orator .
and i would not try to convince you of the worthiness of our cause .
i' m a soldier .
and we are at war .
from philadelphia , we expect a declaration of independence .
8 of the 1 3 colonies have levied money ... ... in support of a continental army .
i ask that south carolina be the ninth .
massachusetts and virginia may be at war ... ... but south carolina is not !
hear , hear .
this is not a war for the independence of one or two colonies ... ... but for the independence of one nation .
and what nation is that ?
an american nation !
there is no such nation and to speak of one is treason .
we are citizens of an american nation .
and our rights are being threatened ... ... by a tyrant 3000 miles away .
would you tell me , please , mr. howard ... ... why should i trade one tyrant 3000 miles away ... ... for 3000 tyrants one mile away ?
an elected legislature can trample a man' s rights as easily as a king can .
captain martin ... ... i understood you to be a patriot .
if you mean by " patriot , " am i angry about taxation without representation ?
well , yes , i am .
should the american colonies govern themselves independently ?
i believe they can .
and they should .
but if you' re asking me am i willing to go to war with england ... ... then the answer is most definitely no .
this from the same captain benjamin martin whose fury was so famous ... ... during the wilderness campaign ?
i was intemperate in my youth .
temperance can be a disguise for fear .
mr. middleton , i fought with captain martin ... ... under washington in the french and lndian war .
there' s not a man in this room ... ... or anywhere for that matter , to whom i would more willingly trust my life .
there are alternatives to war .
we take our case before the king .
we plead with him .
we tried .
well , then , we try again and again if necessary to avoid a war .
i was at bunker hill .
the british advanced three times .
we killed 700 at point blank range and still they took the ground .
that is the measure of their resolve .
if your principles dictate independence ... ... then war is the only way .
it is come to that .
hear , hear .
i have seven children .
my wife is dead .
now , who' s to care for them if i go to war ?
wars are not fought only by childless men .
granted .
but mark my words .
this war will be fought , not on the frontier ... ... or on some distant battlefield ... ... but amongst us .
among our homes .
our children will learn of it with their own eyes .
and the innocent will die with the rest of us .
i will not fight .
and because i will not fight , i will not cast a vote ... ... that will send others to fight in my stead .
and your principles ?
i' m a parent .
i haven' t got the luxury of principles .
we must vote to levy !
28 to 1 2 !
the levy passed !
you intend to enlist without my permission ?
yes , i do .
father , i thought you were a man of principle .
when you have a family of your own , perhaps you' il understand .
when i have a family of my own , i won' t hide behind them .
he' s as imprudent as his father was at his age .
regrettably so .
i' il see to it that he serves under me .
make him a clerk or quartermaster , something of that sort .
good luck .
though many seasons have passed ... ... it seems iike only yesterday when we iast saw each otherin charles town .
with sadness , i iearned ofits recent faii to the british ... ... under generai cornwailis .
i received a ietter from aunt charlotte ... ... saying she closed herhome in charles town after the city feil ... ... and moved to herplantation on the santee .
here in the north , our campaign has been marked by defeat and privation .
ourlosses have been grievous .
my good friend , peter cuppin , feii at elizabethtown .
his death has been difficult to bear .
we wiii march south with generai gates ... ... to fight the redcoats under cornwailis .
thank you , sir .
easy , red .
easy .
i envy you ... ... youryouth and distance from this cruei conflict of which i am a part .
but i am fortunate to be serving the cause of liberty .
and though i fear death ... ... each day in prayer i reaffirm my willingness ... ... to give my life in its service .
pray for me .
but above all , pray for the cause .
your loving brother , gabriel .
what are you doing ?
turn around .
not yet , thomas .
when ?
seventeen .
that' s two years .
it' s already been two .
the war could be over by then .
god willing .
all right .
seventeen .
all right .
put it back , please .
father ?
what happened at fort wilderness ?
put it away .
six pounders .
lots of them .
how far away ?
they' re a long way off .
they' re most likely heading the other direction .
put those in the house .
they might come this way .
must i tell you again ?
let' s all stay close in to the house , all right ?
we' il have to fight them off .
won' t father do that ?
they' il probably kill us men ... ... and do lord knows what to you women .
nathan !
slowly turn .
father .
abigale !
water and bandages , fast .
the battle .
were you there ?
have you seen any redcoats ?
no , not yet .
abigale , the children , please .
children , come .
upstairs .
gates marched us straight at the redcoats .
our lines broke .
the british green dragoons cut us to bits .
i was given these dispatches .
as i left , i saw the virginia regulars surrender .
the dragoons rode into them .
killed them all .
over 200 men .
i have to get these dispatches to hillsborough .
you can' t ride .
i can' t stay here !
it' s not safe for
fire !
fire !
thank you for the care of his majesty' s soldiers .
have a detachment take our wounded to our surgeons at winnsboro .
yes , sir .
fire the house and barns .
let it be known if you harbor the enemy you will lose your home .
by order of king george ... ... all slaves of the american colonies who fight for the crown ... ... will be granted their freedom with our victory .
we' re not slaves .
we work this land .
we' re freedmen .
then you' re freedmen who will have the privilege ... ... of fighting in the king' s army .
rebel dispatches , sir .
who carried this ?
who carried this ? !
i did , sir .
i was wounded .
these people gave me care .
they have nothing to do with the dispatches .
take this one to camden .
he is a spy .
hang him , put his body on display .
he' s a dispatch rider .
destroy the livestock .
save the horses for the dragoons .
colonel , this is a uniformed dispatch rider carrying a marked case .
he cannot be held as a spy .
well , we won' t hold him .
we' re going to hang him .
colonel  father !
oh , i see .
he' s your son .
perhaps you should' ve taught him something of loyalty .
colonel , i beg you , please reconsider .
by the rules of war
would you like a lesson , sir , in the rules of war ?
or perhaps your children would .
no lesson is necessary .
sir .
what of the rebel wounded ?
kill them .
father .
father , do something !
be quiet !
gabriel , run !
wait !
no !!
stupid boy .
captain .
come , child .
i' m not leaving these children !
mercy !
get ready !
present !
fire !
all of you , stay here .
nathan , samuel .
margaret .
hide in the fields with william and susan .
if we' re not back by sunset , take them to aunt charlotte' s .
ls that clear ?
boys .
it' s a good spot .
boys , listen to me .
i' il fire first .
start with the officers and work your way down .
can you tell the difference ?
yes , father .
yes , father .
good .
samuel , after your first shot , reload for nathan .
now ... ... if anything should happen to me , drop your weapons .
run as quickly as you can .
get your brother and your sisters ... ... and take them to aunt charlotte' s .
understood ?
what did i say about shooting ?
aim small , miss small .
aim small , miss small .
boys ... ... samuel ... ... steady .
lord , make me fast and accurate .
aim small , miss small .
aim small , miss small .
aim small , miss small .
on the right !
to the left !
behind us !
up on the ridge !
form right !

behind you !
look on the rear !
we have the private the cherokee scouts brought in .
private ?
private .
colonel william tavington , green dragoons .
what happened ?
who did this ?
him .
it was mad .
i couldn' t tell you who it was .
calm down .
calm down , man .
twenty of his majesty' s soldiers are dead .
and i need to know how .
he said there was  were you there ?
then let him speak .
take your time and tell me .
how many were there ?
were they militia ?
were they regulars ?
i don' t really remember how many .
maybe one .
one man .
really ?
he was in the flank .
all around us .
amongst us .
i could barely see him .
he was there , then he was gone .
he just vanished .
sounds more like a ghost than a man .
a ghost .
he was like a ghost .
enough .
bordon ?
take a patrol .
capture this ghost before word of his exploits spread .
who' s this ?
sir , this is captain wilkins .
he was with the loyalist colonial militia .
he might be of use .
another colonial .
captain wilkins , where do your loyalties lie ?
to king and country .
why should i trust a man who' d betray his neighbors ?
those neighbors of mine who stand against england ... ... deserve to die a traitor' s death .
we' il see .
mr. martin !
miss charlotte !
you' re safe now .
try to sleep .
good night .
good night .
father ?
yes .
i killed those men .
you did what i told you to do .
you did what you had to .
there was no wrong in it .
i' m glad i killed them .
i' m glad .
get some rest .
you' ve done nothing for which you should be ashamed .
i' ve done nothing .
and for that , i am ashamed .
gates and the continental army are at hillsborough .
i' m joining up with them .
no .
your place is here now .
i' m going back .
i' m a soldier , it' s my duty .
your duty is to your family .
don' t you walk away from me , boy !
i' il find you when it' s over .
no , i forbid you to go !
i' m not a child !
you' re my child !
goodbye , father .
thomas is dead .
how many more have to die before you' il heed my word ?
i' m losing my family .
when will you be back , father ?
i don' t know .
tomorrow ?
no , not tomorrow .
you say your prayers .
i will .
take care of your brothers and sisters and your aunt charlotte .
i' m depending on you .
as i am on you , samuel .
all right .
susan ... ... goodbye .
thank you .
halt !
make ready !
take aim !
fire !
i' m not going back .
no , i didn' t expect you would .
that gates is a damn fool .
he spent too many years in the british army .
going muzzle to muzzle with redcoats in open field .
it' s madness .
halt !
make ready !
present !
fire !
this battle was over before it began .
retreat !
retreat !
these rustics are so inept .
nearly takes the honor out of victory .
nearly .
hold him firm .
where' s your commanding officer ?
that tent there .
it' s a lost cause .
benjamin martin .
i' m in no mood for a lecture .
where' s your general gates now ?
the last anyone saw , riding hard northeast ... ... his staff 1 00 yards behind , trying to catch up .
so who' s in command ?
i am .
i think .
what are my orders ?
we' re a breath away from losing this war , benjamin .
ln the north , washington is reeling from morristown .
he' s running and hiding from 1 2, 000 redcoats .
ln the south , cornwallis has broken our back .
captured over 5000 of our troops when he took charles town .
and he destroyed the only army between him and new york .
nothing will stop him from heading north to finish off washington .
unless we can keep cornwallis in the south till the french arrive .
they' ve promised a fleet and 1 0, 000 troops .
when ?
six months at the earliest .
you trust the french to keep their word ?
absolument .
benjamin martin .
major jean villeneuve .
french seventh light foot .
he will help train the militia .
the hero of fort wilderness .
your reputation precedes you .
you really expect to hold cornwallis here using just militia ?
not me .
you .
they' re not soldiers , they' re farmers .
they' d be better off letting the british march through .
they' d be better off , but the cause wouldn' t .
how many men does cornwallis have ?
8000 infantry .
around 600 cavalry .
i' m giving you a field commission as a colonel .
might i request that you transfer my son under my command ?
sir , no , i
that' s done .
thank you .
colonel , i' ve been a soldier for two years .
as a scout , horseman , marksman , scavenger .
ls that so ?
i' d be of better use with regulars .
where' d you learn all that riding , shooting , scavenging ?
my father taught me .
teach you any humility ?
he tried .
it didn' t take .
he also taught you every trail between here and charles town ... ... which is why he transferred you .
we' il put the word out .
start on the south side of
we' il cover more ground if we split up .
very well , corporal .
you take harrisville , pembroke , wakefield .
i' il start on the north side .
meet at the mission in black swamp .
corporal .
be careful .
yes , sir .
you have children ?
french .
it skirts the mountain and then ... ... extends down towards the headwater here ... ... and right across to the far bank of the ohio river .
it' s 1 00, 000 acres .
it' s an imposing land grant , my lord .
you will be a country unto yourself .
his majesty is most generous .
though your service in this war more than warrants such a gift .
yes , this is how his majesty rewards those ... ... who fight for him as gentlemen .
i dare to presume my own meager contributions will be rewarded one day .
you may presume too much .
his majesty , like history , judges us by the outcome of the war ... ... and the manner in which it was fought .
we serve the crown , and we must conduct ourselves accordingly .
surrendering troops will be given quarter .
these brutal tactics must stop !
ls it not enough that i have never lost a battle ?
you serve me ... ... and the manner in which you serve me reflects upon me !
i would' ve thought that a gentleman from a family as esteemed as yours ... ... would understand that .
my late father squandered any esteem in which we were held ... ... along with my inheritance .
i advance myself only through victory .
you advance yourself only through my good graces .
these colonials are our brethren .
and when this conflict is over , we will reestablish commerce with them .
do you understand , colonel ?
perfectly , my lord .
reverend , with your permission , i' d like to make an announcement .
young man , this is a house of god .
i understand that , reverend .
i apologize .
the south carolina militia is being called up .
i' m here to enlist every man willing .
son ... ... we are here to pray ... ... for the souls of those men hanging outside .
yes , pray for them .
but honor them by taking up arms with us .
and bring more suffering to this town ?
if king george can hang those men , he can hang any one of us .
dan scott ... ... barely a week ago you railed for two hours about independence .
mr. hardwick , how many times have i heard you ... ... speak of freedom at my father' s table ?
half the men in this church , including you , father ... ... and you , reverend ... ... are as ardent patriots as i.
will you now , when you are needed most , stop at only words ?
ls that the sort of men you are ?
i ask only that you act upon the beliefs ... ... of which you have so strongly spoken ... ... and in which you so strongly believe .
who' s with us ?
mr. howard .
sir ... ... may i have permission to write to anne ?
may i have permission to write anne ?
yes .
you have permission ... ... to write me .
oh , write her .
very well .
thank you , sir .
reverend ?
a shepherd must tend his flock .
and , at times , fight off the wolves .
are you sure this is the right place to recruit for a militia ?
god save king george !
i think we came to the right place .
any bounty ?
no scalp money this time , rollins .
but you can keep or sell me the muskets and gear of any redcoat you kill .
they hanged my brother down in acworth .
every damned one of them redcoats deserves to die .
sign up .
with all my ailments ... ... i wouldn' t make it through the first skirmish .
no , sir .
but you can have my negro .
he' il fight in my stead .
occam !
get over here .
ain' t overly smart .
he' s strong as a bull .
can you write ?
no , no , sir .
well , then , make your mark .
why ?
i just signed him over to you .
if you' re willing , make your mark .
that' il do .
i' il kill me some redcoats .
i believe you would .
how old are you ?
not quite old enough .
but his time will come .
john billings .
i was hoping you' d turn up .
there' s a story going around about 20 redcoats ... ... got killed by a ghost or some damn thing .
carried a cherokee tomahawk .
aren' t you a little old to be believing in ghost stories ?
how many did you get ?
twelve .
good .
these men , they' re not the sort we need .
they' re exactly the sort we need .
they' ve fought this kind of war before .
what about me ?
am i one of that sort ?
hell , no .
your sort gives that sort a bad name .
i want accuracy and precision .
make ready !
take aim !
fire !
our force continues to grow .
as iong as we continue to fight , others wiii come to fight beside us .
i iong to see you and speak to you .
i' m hopefui that our duties wiii bring me nearyou .
untii then , i am and wiii remain most affectionately yours .
gabriel .
we surrender !
no !
god , stop !
for the love of god , we
these men were about to surrender !
perhaps .
we will never know .
this is murder !
hell , reverend , they' re redcoats .
they' ve earned it .
we' re better than that .
what do you know about war ?
i know the difference between fighting
go back to church !
quiet !
he' s right .
quarter will be given to british wounded and any who surrender .
they gave no quarter when they fired on a ship carrying my wife and daughters .
i watched from 200 yards off as they were burned alive .
all my sympathy , but my order stands .
damn your sympathy .
who are you to give such an order ?
i know what you did to my countrymen at fort wilderness .
we' re militia .
this is not regular army .
every man here is free to come and go as he pleases .
but while you' re here ... ... you will obey my command or i will have you shot .
damn dogs !
shoot the damn things !
stay that pistol .
they won' t let you near the wagon .
rum , madeira .
no wonder they were guarding it .
officers ' uniforms .
what you think all this is worth ?
it' s the personal correspondence of lord cornwallis .
this is his journal .
i say we drink the wine , eat the dogs and use the papers for musket wadding .
eat the dogs ?
dog is a fine meal .
good heavens .
i have some maps here for you .
put them down over there .
thank you .
here .
a proper musket for you .
i don' t know about you , but i don' t like the idea giving muskets to slaves .
your sense of freedom is as pale as your skin .
don' t listen to them .
if we win this war , a lot of things will change .
what will change ?
they call this the new world .
it' s not .
it' s the same as the old .
but we' il have a chance to build a new world .
a world where all men are created equal under god .
equal .
sounds good .
i' ve just been in the mind of a genius .
cornwallis knows more about warfare than we could learn in a dozen lifetimes .
that' s cheerful news .
his victories at camden and charles town were perfect .
perfect .
and he knows it , what' s more .
perhaps that' s his weakness .
sir ?
pride .
pride' s a weakness .
personally , i would prefer stupidity .
pride will do .
finished , my lord .
i' ve taken it in at the back ... ... added wider epaulets and looped gold braiding .
it' s a horse blanket .
i don' t know , my lord .
it' s really quite nice .
very nice , my lord .
very well .
it' s a nice horse blanket .
colonel tavington , why , after six weeks ... ... am i still attending a ball in south carolina ... ... when i should be attending balls in north carolina ?
first , the theft of my baggage ... ... including my memoirs , on which i spent countless hours .
then half the bridges and ferries between here and charles town burned .
if you can' t protect our supply lines against militia ... ... how do you intend doing so against the regulars or the french ?
they won' t fight like regulars .
we can' t find them .
colonel , they' re militia .
they' re farmers with pitchforks !
they' re rather more than that , i' m afraid .
made so by their commander , this ghost .
oh , ghost , ghost , ghost .
you created this ghost , colonel .
your brutality swelled his ranks .
without them this ghost would' ve disappeared ... ... and i' d be in north carolina by now !
in my defense , my lord
oh , enough , enough !
a fine soldier you are , bested by a bedtime story .
give me the horse blanket .
o' hara , our supply ship appears to have arrived .
yes , my lord , it has .
then why am i still wearing this rag ?
your replacement wardrobe is aboard ship , but ... ... colonel tavington thought it best to secure our arms and munitions first .
they are being unloaded .
you look good in that color .
it stinks .
well , it' s had a dead man in it .
the beasts took your dogs too ?
yes .
fine animals .
a gift from his majesty .
dead now , for all i know .
is there no decency ?
oh , fireworks .
lovely !
mr. howard .
i' ve come to call on anne .
i' ve come to call on anne !
well , of course you call yourself a man .
father , stop it .
you heard him .
well ... ... call on her .
i' m nearly finished .
you needn' t worry , father .
yeah , i know .
bundling bags are a wonderful tradition .
i don' t mind in the least .
be still .
tea ?
please .
there .
come , dear .
it' s very good .
i' m pleased that you like it .
peter .
don' t worry .
i sew better than my mother did .
i hope so .
if you' re just gonna stand there ... ... why don' t you read it for us ?
i can' t read .
i can .
take notice .
by order of general washington and the continental congress ... ... all bound slaves who give minimum one year service ... ... in the continental army ... ... will be granted freedom ... ... and be paid a bounty of five shillings for each month of service .
did you hear that ?
first they' il free them , then they' il pay them .
only another six months .
what will you do with freedom ?
i made this for you .
look after your mother .
you know , peter ... ... i can' t pay you for this .
benjamin , you pay me what you can , when you can .
i' m obliged .
gabriel sure reminds me a lot of you .
no , no , he' s more like his mother .
corporal !
take your time .
dogs .
sir .
this road is closed .
these wagons now belong to the continental army .
ready arms !
by twos !
there' s no need for your men to die .
leave the wagons and go .
this is the king' s highway .
and i advise you and your men to make way .
charge !
fire !
retreat !
save yourselves !
retreat !
ambush !
ambush !
i have the count .
22 are dead .
1 8 wounded and 20 are missing .
i' m through .
he won' t be the last to leave .
trust me .
soon my countrymen will arrive .
the french army is  to hell with you .
and to hell with the french army .
we don' t need them .
we got benjamin martin .
we know what he done to the french .
father .
men always buy you drinks because of what happened at fort wilderness .
strangers know more about you than i do .
tell me what happened .
your mother asked me that question around about the time you were born .
i was drunk and foolish enough to answer it .
the french and the cherokee had raided along the blue ridge .
the english settlers had sought refuge at fort charles .
by the time we got there , the fort was abandoned .
they' d left about a week before .
but what we found was ....
go on .
they' d killed all the settlers , the men .
with the women and ... ... some of the children , they had ....
we buried them all , what was left of them .
we caught up with them at fort wilderness .
we took our time .
we cut them apart slowly .
piece by piece .
i can see their faces .
i can still hear their screams .
all but two .
we let them live .
we sent the heads on a pallet ... ... with the two that lived back to fort ambercon .
the eyes , tongues , fingers ... ... we put in baskets .
sent them down the asheulot to the cherokee .
soon after , the cherokee broke their treaty with the french .
that' s how we justified it .
we were ... ... heroes .
and men bought you drinks .
not a day goes by where i don' t ask god' s forgiveness for what i did .
thomas was my brother , as well as your son .
you may not believe this , but i want satisfaction as much as you do .
but not at the expense of our cause .
there will be a time for revenge .
but until then , stay the course .
your mother said that when i' d get drunk or lose my temper .
she' d say it to me when i picked on thomas .
i miss him .
the british got 1 8 of our men at fort carolina .
they' il be hung one at a time until they give up the rest of us .
reverend ... ... can you write a letter for me ?
to my wife and boy .
yes , of course i will .
but first let us pray .
my iord ... ... there is a rider at the gates .
a civilian carrying a white flag .
i am occupied .
he has a pair of dogs with him .
great danes .
and dearlord ... ... protect us in this , our hour of need .
this we ask in the name of the father , the son ....
and the holy ghost .
wait here .
general lord cornwallis will be with you shortly .
jupiter , mars .
come , boys .
come .
my good boys .
my brave boys .
you seem to be well fed .
i thank you for that .
i' m afraid i don' t know your name .
i' m a colonel in the continental army .
my rank should be sufficient for now .
as you wish .
please be seated .
thank you .
would you , as the initiating officer , care to begin ?
i will , unless you' d like to claim aggrieved status .
yes , i would like to claim aggrieved status .
very well , sir .
proceed .
you have in your possession belongings of mine including clothing ... ... furniture , personal effects of a non military nature ... ... which i' d like returned to me .
indeed .
i will do so as soon as possible .
thank you .
now we come to the matter of the specific targeting ... ... of officers during engagements .
you must know that in civilized warfare , officers in the field ... ... must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention .
to your mind , what are appropriate levels of hostile attention ?
imagine the chaos that would follow ... ... from leaderless armies having at each other .
there must be gentlemen in command to lead ... ... and , where necessary , restrain their men .
restrain them from , say , targeting civilians .
women , children and such .
that' s a separate issue .
no .
i consider them linked .
and as long as your soldiers attack civilians ... ... i will order the shooting of officers at every engagement .
and my men are excellent marksmen .
very well .
now , let us move on to  prisoner exchange .
sir ?
you have 1 8 of my men .
i want them back .
i do have 1 8 criminals under sentence of death ... ... but i hold no prisoners of war .
if that' s your position , 1 8 of your officers will have to die .
nineteen , if you hang me with my men .
my officers ?
sir .
top of the ridge , to your left .
below the tree line .
their names and ranks ?
they refused to give names .
there are 9 lieutenants , 5 captains , 3 majors ... ... and one fat colonel who called me ... ... a cheeky fellow .
this is not the conduct of a gentleman .
if the conduct of your officers is the measure of a gentleman ... ... i' il take that as a compliment .
get my men .
arrange the exchange .
my lord .
thank you , sir .
release the prisoners !
what is this ?
prisoner exchange .
he has 1 8 of our officers .
who is he ?
i recognize him .
he' s the commander of the militia .
your ghost .
stay that sword , colonel !
he rode in under a white flag for formal parley .
this is madness .
if you harm him , you condemn our officers .
with respect , sir , he' s killed as many officers in the last two months .
he has shown no aggression here .
hence he cannot be touched .
has he not ?
you !
so you' re the ghost , are you ?
i remember you !
on that farm !
that stupid little boy !
did he die ?
you know ... ... it' s an ugly business , doing one' s duty .
but just occasionally ... ... it' s a real pleasure .
before this war is over , i' m going to kill you .
why wait ?
soon .
move out !
but i still think it' s imperative to push north .
one of our captured officers , my lord .
my reputation suffers because ofyourincompetence !
that man insults me !
quite impressive for a farmer with a pitchfork , wouldn' t you say ?
i want you to find that man .
i want you to capture him .
the man has the loyalty of the people .
they protect him .
protect his family .
protect the families of his men .
i can capture him for you .
but to do so requires the use of tactics that are somewhat ....
what was the word your lordship used ?
brutal , " i think .
go on .
i am prepared to do what is necessary .
i alone will assume the full mantle of responsibility for my actions ... ... free of the chain of command ... ... rendering you blameless .
however ... ... if i do this ... ... you and i both know that i can never return to england with honor .
what , i wonder , is to become of me ?
when this war is over here in the colonies ... ... the new aristocracy ... ... will be landowners .
tell me about ohio .
make way .
as you were .
wilkins .
a plantation seven miles from wakefield , on the santee ... ... east of black swamp .
who lived there ?
benjamin martin .
he' s the ghost .
what do you know about him ?
hell , everything .
i could tell you the size of his boot .
does he have family ?
where would he hide his children ?
his wife' s sister has a plantation .
it' s not far .
aunt charlotte !
wake up , someone' s coming !
get the boys .
margaret , come quickly .
let' s go .
boys , come .
go .
stay close .
this way .
follow me .
we' il go downstairs to the kitchen .
margaret , quick !
get down there !
fast !
samuel , get down there fast !
beneath the sill .
there .
there' s no one in the house .
they can' t be far .
search the outbuildings and the woods , quickly .
prepare to fire the house .
go .
this one' s head of the house slaves .
where are they hiding ?
keep looking !
they' re here somewhere !
gabriel .
where' s father ?
torch the house !
to horse !
come on !
it' s all right .
susan , come here .
charlotte !
they won' t stop looking for us .
you' il be safe where we' re taking you .
father said it was a perfect place to hide .
how is he ?
i don' t know .
i' m his son .
where is father ?
speaking for months now .
speaking for months .
why did he go ?
he didn' t want those mean men to find you , so he led them away .
he' il come see you as soon as he can .
i don' t care .
i hate him .
susan , you don' t hate him .
i hate him , and i hope he never comes back .
it' s the children .
abigale !
you' re alive !
she spoke .
susan talked to you ?
ln full sentences .
as if she' d been speaking all along .
damn , i wasn' t there for it .
what did she say ?
she said ... ... that she loves you and misses you ... ... but understands why you can' t be with her .
my lord , she said that .
lsn' t that something ?
tavington has a list of our men .
he' s burning our homes ... ... killing whomever resists .
where ?
seven homes along the santee so far .
john , this is not a time for vengeance .
this is a time for mourning .
attend to your families .
one week furlough for all men .
any man who does not return will not be thought a coward or uncommitted .
father !
papa !
they' re huge .
what have you been feeding them ?
they' re from good stock on their father' s side .
susan ?
i see it .
there it is .
look .
look , father .

i got it !
you got it .
i got it !
careful .
i caught it .
all the fish are over here .
let' s get them .
father , what changed you ?
are you sure i have ?
yes .
you changed .
that' s simple .
it was your mother .
a woman can have a strange effect on a man .
there were times ... ... i had trouble breathing around your mother .
i know the feeling .
you once said ... ... when i had a family of my own , i' d understand .
you were right .
you' re trying to tell me something .
apple ?
thank you .
congratulations .
anne patricia howard ... ... will you have this man to be your husband to live in marriage ?
will you love , comfort and honor him ... ... for so long as you both shall live ?
i will .
gabriel edward martin , will you have this woman to be your wife ... ... to live together in the covenant of marriage ?
will you love , comfort and honor her as long as you both shall live ?
i will .
then by the power vested in me by our mutual faith ... ... in the lord , our god ... ... i now pronounce you man and wife .
i' m sorry we didn' t give you more warning .
it' s fine .
i have something for you .
it belonged to gabriel' s mother .
it' s beautiful .
allow me .
it' s the north star .
that' s the only star in the sky that never moves .
it' s constant , unwavering .
a guide .
i' d be honored .
may i ?
if you must .
i must .
may i sit with you ?
it' s a free country .
or at least it will be .
i' m not my sister .
i know that .
do you ?
yes , i do .

i' il come back .
you believe me ?
you know , you make me very happy .
just the three of us ?
john raskin did come by earlier .
he looked around , then he left .
he would' ve made four .
four would have been better .
i got another two months to go before i get to twelve months .
colonel .
reverend .
trust the french .
yes , trust the french .
where else do i get the opportunity to kill a few redcoats ?
perhaps a few wounded ones when you are not looking .
everyone must gather at the church .
mr. wilkins ?
colonel tavington wishes to address the whole village .
this town has given aid to benjamin martin and his rebels .
i wish to know his whereabouts .
so ... ... anyone who comes forward ... ... may be forgiven their treason .
very well .
you had your chance .
wait !
this man gives them supplies .
quiet !
he brings them to black swamp .
liar !
ln the marsh , by the old spanish mission .
this man here ?
yes .
the black swamp , you say ?
by the old spanish mission .
thank you very much .
shut the doors .
but you said we' d be forgiven .
and indeed you may !
that' s between you and god .
be strong .
we must .
i' il fire the town on your orders .
the town ?
burn the church .
there' s no honor in this .
didn' t you say all those who stand against england ... ... deserve to die a traitor' s death ?
burn the church , captain .
give me the torch .
the honor is found in the end , not the means .
this will be forgotten .
bordon .
anne !
mrs. howard ?
where is everybody ?
they' re not here .
gabriel' s gone .
to arms !
to arms !
father .
just don' t talk .
don' t talk .
father .
i' m sorry .

i' il take care of you .
you' il be all right .
i' m sorry about thomas .
oh , son , that wasn' t your fault .
that was mine .

you' re gonna be all right .
don' t go .
gabriel , don' t .
oh , god help me .
god help me .
where is he ?
i' il help you bury him .
i' il bury him .
my wife in alexandria is with child .
my first .
i fight for that child .
benjamin , nothing will replace your sons .
but if you come with us , you can justify their sacrifice .
why ?
why do men feel they can justify death ?
ls it arrogance or ... ?
i have long feared ... ... that my sins would return to visit me .
and the cost is more than i can bear .
benjamin , we have a chance .
greene and dan morgan are down from virginia .
if we win this next battle , victory in the war is within our grasp .
go , then .
seek your victory .
i' m small issue to it .
you' re wrong , benjamin .
you matter to your men ... ... and to others as well .
your victories ... ... and your losses ... ... are shared by more than you know .
stay with us .
stay the course .
i have run my course .
you men will be leaving with us .
prepare the baggage .
jean .
tomorrow' s battle can alter the course of the war .
general greene , what exactly is the task before us ?
gentlemen , cornwallis has us cornered .
not only does he outnumber us ... ... but nearly half of our force is militia .
unreliable , at best .
excuse me , sir .
you underestimate our militia .
all of you do .
we' ve seen our militia lines break time and again .
kips bay , princeton .
but the british have seen that too .
cornwallis ' own letters bear out that he has no respect for the militia .
what are you suggesting , ben ?
i' m suggesting we use that .
i know you men have sacrificed a lot so far .
but all i' m asking is that you ... ... let the front line of the militia fire two shots tomorrow .
a lot can happen in the time it takes to fire two shots .
especially against british regulars .
lndeed .
that' s why i' m not asking you to fire three .
if i die , i will die well dressed .
fire !
battalion !
company , halt !
harry ... ... will you give this to my children ?
thank you .
it' s october now .
i know .
it' s more than 1 2 months .
you' re a free man .
i' m here now on my own accord .
i' m honored to have you with us .
honored .
shoulder arms !
forward ... ... march !
how old were your daughters ?
violette was 1 2 and pauline , 1 0 .
they had green eyes .
i' m sure they were lovely .
yes , they were .
battalion !
company !
march !

unless i' m dreaming ... ... i believe i see militia forming at their center .
battalion , halt !
dress ranks !
make ready !

artillery , concentrate on the center .
if we reform and wheel right , we may be able to turn their flank .
you dream , general .
kill me before the war is over , will you ?
it appears you are not ... ... the better man .
you' re right .
my sons were better men .
sound the retreat .
sound ... ... retreat .
the warhas turned .
generai cornwailis took flight with his army and moved north .
we continued to engage the british , and in the foilowing months ... ... cornwailis entrenched himself at yorktown , virginia .
washington escaped from the north ... ... and surrounded cornwailis , who could not retreat to the seas .
it was blocked offby ourlong iost friends ... ... who had finaily arrived .
vive ia france .
vive ia iiberte^ .
my lord , i beseech you .
you must order the surrender .
how could it come to this ?
an army of rabble .
peasants .
everything will change .
everything has changed .
though he eventuaily surrendered ... ... cornwailis himselfhid in shame ... ... appointing his subordinate to relinquish his sword .
with the war ending , and ourmilitia disbanding ... ... i take measure of what we have iost ... ... and what we have won .
my hope and prayeris that the sacrifices borne by so many ... ... wiii spawn and fulfiii the promise of ournew nation .
teii the children , and especiaily susan , that i wiii keep mypromise ... ... as i wiii be returning to you aii soon .
where will you go now ?
home .
start over .
your wife' s expecting a child , isn' t she ?
she gave birth to a son three weeks ago .
what' d you name him ?
we named him gabriel .
thank you , harry .
gabriel is a good name for a farmer .
it is .
it is .
jean .
ben .
gabriel said if we won the war ... ... we could build a whole new world .
just figured we' d get started right here ... ... with your home .
sounds good .
thank you .
