how long' s he been dead ?
oh , less than an hour .
less than an hour .
maybe half that .
maybe half .

chief here ?
hey , what' s up , sam ?
chief ?
what' s goin ' on ?
sam ?
wood ?
yes , sir ?
when' s the last time i asked courtney to get oil for this damn thing ?
uh , last wednesday .
would you be kind enough to go outside and remind him what day it is today ?
well , uh ... how about the prisoner here ?
don' t you worry about him .
got a name , boy ?
virgil tibbs .
virgil ?
well , i don' t think we' re gonna have any trouble , are we , virgil ?
no trouble at all .
oh , you can go now , sam .
yes , sir .
what did you hit him with ?

what' s a northern boy like you doin ' all the way down here ?
i was waiting for the train .
there ain' t no trains this time of mornin ' .
tuesdays only .
4 . 05 to memphis .
you say .
well ...
all right , you say right .
all right ...
virgil .
oh !
now look .
i try to run a nice , clean , safe town here .
a town where a man can sneeze and not get his brains beat out .
you follow me ?
yes .
why don' t you tell me how you killed mr. colbert ?
you' il feel a whole lot better .
not now !
i was visiting my mother .
i came in on the 12 . 35 from brownsville .
i was waiting to go out on the 4 . 05 .
mm hm .
yeah .
and meanwhile , you killed yourself a white man and picked yourself up $200 !
i earned that money , ten hours a day , seven days a week .
coloured can' t earn that .
it s more than i make in a month !
where did you earn it ? !
philadelphia .
mississippi ?
pennsylvania .
just how do you earn that kinda money ?
i' m a police officer .
oh , yeah .
wood !
yes , sir !
did you question this man ?
no , sir .
would you mind taking a look at that ?
yeah !
oh , yeah !
i' il check on this wise city boy .
you take him outside and hold him .
yes , sir .
may i suggest that you call my chief rather than send a wire or anything ?
i mean , it would be quicker .
and i' il pay for the call .
did you hear ?
did you hear him say he' d pay for the call ?
how much do they pay you to do their police work ? $162 . 39 per week .
$162 . 39 a week !
well , boy !
take him outside , wood .
but treat him easy , because a man that makes $162 . 39 a week man , we do not wanna ruffle him !
no , sir !
courtney ... would you try and get me long distance ?
police business , honey .
chief' s on the line .
no .
he catch you listenin ' in , he' il run your butt around the block .
he don' t panic me none .
no ?
where' s the chief ?
you got the pictures of the dead man ?
sure do .
i got him top , bottom , sideways you name it .
good .
i' il take ' em , son .
no , i wanna give ' em to the chief .
i said i' d take ' em , charlie .
do like he tells you , charlie .
somebody owes me some money for those .
i had to buy paper and film and developin ' .
that' s all right .
just bill the department .
everything will be taken care of .
god almighty .
he sure looks bad .
may i see the man i am supposed to have killed ?
sure .
i don' t know why not .
hey , sam .
he' s finished talkin ' .
here' s the photos of the dead man .
ok .
got your chief on the phone .
he wants to talk to you .
hello ?
yes , sir .
i' m sorry to have gotten you involved in this .
i really had no choice .
yes , sir .
you can' t be serious , sir .
i mean , even if i could be of help , they wouldn' t want it .
no , sir .
i' m not prejudiced .
yes , sir .
i am a police officer and they' re police officers , but ...
hello .
this is gillespie .
yes , sir .
yep , well ...
you don' t say ?
he' s your number one homicide expert ?
well , my , my , my .
i don' t think we need any help .
we can wrap this up ourselves .
yes , sir .
but i do want to thank you for offering me such a powerful piece of manpower as virgil tibbs .
yes , sir .
thank you .
yeah .
goodbye , now .
oh , it' s all there .
we paid for the phone call ourselves .
now , you are the number one homicide expert .
that' s right .
i bet you look at a lot of dead bodies .
lots .
well ?
well , what ?
well ...
i just thought maybe , uh ...
maybe you wouldn' t mind takin ' a look at this one ?
no , thanks .
why not , expert ?
because i' ve got a train to catch .
wait a minute .
that train don' t leave till noon .
they pay you $162 . 39 a week just to look at bodies .
why can' t you look at this one ?
why can' t you look at it for yourself ?
because i' m not an expert ...
officer !
ten cents , ten million dollars just doesn' t matter when a man' s time comes .
mm hm .
i could give him a nicer service right here in sparta than he could ever get up there in chicago .
and at half the price , too .
i got a rosewood casket out there ...
ted ulam , chief .
we haven' t had the pleasure .
that' s for sure .
he' s with me .
hello , doc .
yep .
well ...
uh ...
do you wanna look at it ?
new manicure .
that' s good .
that' s very good .
i' il need a few things .
such as ?
ammonium hydrosulphide , benzidine , superoxide of hydrogen .
copper powder , distilled water .
a six inch celluloid scale .
thermometer .
some tweezers .
callipers .
and some toothpicks .
toothpicks ? !
copper ... ?
what' s goin ' on here , chief ?
who is this boy anyway ?
i asked him to look at the body .
that' s who he is .
it s 4 . 45 .
what time was this man killed ?
sam found him at 3am .
the doctor says it' s possible he was killed an hour earlier .
at two ?
maybe a little later .
2 . 15 ... 2 . 30 ?
would you feel the face and jaw , please ?
am i mistaken , or has rigor begun ?
it has .
you' il notice too that postmortem lividity is present .
so the time of death really has to be earlier .
wouldn' t you say ?
mm .
well , we' il be able to pinpoint that as soon as i get a thermometer .
as you know , the loss of heat from the brain is the most reliable way of determining time of death .
right , chief ?
oh , yeah .
well ...
which one of you gentlemen will assist me ?
ulam' s funer ...
it s for you , chief .
yeah .
talk to me .
when ?
oh , good .
yeah , yeah .
right away .
i' ve got a runaway suspect , boy .
i gotta go .
now listen , you .
anything he wants , man , you better see that he gets it .
where can i wash my hands ?
this here' s shagbag , you hear ?
he' s headed for the river .
the river , you hear ?
he' s gonna be in arkansas .
shoot .
ok .
i got him .
mrs. colbert .
how is she taking it ?
chief had to leave .
she don' t know it yet .
hey !
you can' t go in there , boy !
mrs. colbert ?
where' s my husband ?
what' s happened to him ?
why won' t anybody tell me what' s happened to him ?
why won' t anybody here tell me ?
i have a right to know if he' s hurt , if he' s been in an accident .
i want to know if he is all right !
your husband is dead , mrs. colbert .
uh ...
somebody killed him .
we don' t know who yet .
it s , uh ...
it s very hot in here .
it s very hot in this room .
sit down .
no .
would you ...
would you ... leave me alone for a few minutes , please ?
virgil , we don' t need you or your microscopes .
tell that to your chief .
we don' t need him or you .
mrs. colbert' s in there .
i' ve already told her .
i see .
here is the examination results from ulam' s .
you wanna know what i found ?
no .
i don' t need to look at ' em now .
may i examine this prisoner ?
yeah , you can look at him .
c' mon , let him look .
go on .
all right , now !
steady !
you finished ?
thank you .
all right , fryer , bring him with me .
now we' re grindin ' corn !
you shoulda been there !
lf it weren' t for them radios , we woulda lost him goin ' over that bridge .
that old boy highballing that train like to cut us off .
and old charlie' s hound dog got loose ...
did he confess ?
huh ?
the man you arrested , did he confess ?
well , i believe he will .
yes siree , i believe he will .
i believe he will .
he' s left handed , isn' t he ?
how do i know ?
well , he seemed left handed to me .
i believe harvey is a southpaw .
now , ain' t he , shagbag ?
what if he is ?
what' s that make him ?
innocent .
mrs. colbert ...
there' s just one more thing .
yeah .
i picked it up , i tell you .
he was already lyin ' there .
it was lyin ' there next to him !
i just picked it up , ma' am .
that' s all i did .
shut up .
get him outta here .
ok .
c' mon , harvey .
let' s go .
mrs. colbert , i , uh ...
i wonder if you' d mind if i have somebody drive you over so you could , uh ... complete the identification ?
martin , i want you to take mrs. colbert over to the funeral parlour .
and , wood , run virgil down the depot .
uh ...
virge here , chief , he thinks that harvey' s innocent .
well , i' il be damned .
could i talk to you about it , in private ?
no .
because i got colbert' s wallet in my hand , and we took it from harvey oberst .
you think he gave it to him ?
i don' t know .
but oberst could have come along after the crime , found it , picked it up .
i don' t know .
that' s what the boy said he did .
well , i' m sorry , ma' am , but i say different .
when i examined the deceased , it was obvious the fatal blow was struck from an angle of 17 degrees from the right , which makes it almost certain the person who did it is right handed .
so what ?
harve' s left handed , chief .
everybody in town knows that .
we figured that out .
harvey' s a lefty .
uh huh .
you' re sure of yourself , virgil .
funny name for a nigger boy from philadelphia .
what do they call you up there ?
they call me mr. tibbs !
mr. tibbs !
well , mr. wood , take mr. tibbs , take him down to the depot .
and i mean , boy , like now !
i' il have the fbi lab send you the report on this .
not that it' il make any difference .
i' il take that .
no , you won' t .
i' m sending it in personally .
my god !
what kind of people are you ?
what kind of a place is this ?
my husband is dead .
somebody in this town killed him !
i want you to find out who !
you gonna give me that ?
no , i' m not .
wood , you take him , and you lock him up for withholding evidence .
go on , move !
put him with his friend , harvey oberst !
well , virgil , nobody threw your brains to the hogs , that' s for damn sure .
hold on there , arnold .
open her up again .
we got another customer .
hey , man , not in here .
put him somewheres else !
don' t push the panic button .
play it cool , boy .
play it cool .
hey !
hey !
what you doin ' wearin ' white man' s clothes ?
where d' you come from ?
you deaf or somethin ' ?
listen , i' m get ...
keep cool , harvey .
i' m on your side .
well , i don' t need you !
i' m all you' ve got .
police ?
you' re a cop ?
you' re a cop .
mm hm .
yeah ?
so , how come they locked you up ?
how come they lock up a cop ?
who said they locked me up ?
how come with all these empty cells here they' d throw me in with you ?
you dig ?
look .
i already told ' em .
i see this fella lyin ' on the street there .
and there' s this wallet lyin ' beside him .
boy , i mean , i come into this world outta luck .
here' s the first good thing to come my way .
and i pick it up .
but when i see whose wallet it is ...
i mean , i start to sweat .
but i heard about this new chief .
this gillepsbie ?
got no more smile than a turnip .
so i cut across the fields , headin ' for the line , and got myself as far as the bridge before gillepsbie grabbed me .
what time did you find the wallet ?
well , i ain' t got no watch , but it must have been after two , by the courthouse clock .
i' m interested in eleven to two .
where were you ?
shootin ' pool .
larry' s lounge .
i got there about ten .
what time' d you leave ?
closin ' .
must have been one .
anybody can swear for you ?
packy , bert , les .
ever been in trouble with the police before ?
come on .
i could ask at the desk , you know .
well , they brought me in one time .
on account of this delores purdy .
on what charge ?
well , uh , this delores , she , uh ... she' s real proud of what nature done for her , you know ?
and , uh ...
well , we was on a date up to clarke' s point , and , uh ... she says , uh ...
anyway , she asks me , she says , uh ...
don' t you think i got a classy build ?
and i say " sure .
and so she starts to show me .
but i didn' t do nothin ' wrong .
i just didn' t stop her from tryin ' to prove her point .
then this cop , sam wood , comes chargin ' outta the bush and hauls me in .
he let you go , didn' t he ?
told me not to mess with her no more .
she lives on third , a block from me .
traipsin ' around in the altogether .
with the lights on .
now , somebody sure oughta make her stop doin ' that .
come here .
let me see your right hand .
what you doin ' ?
hold still .
all right now , give him the waiver for false arrest .
forget it .
i' m askin ' you to sign it .
please .
give him a pen .
give him a pen .
all right .
let him out .
you' il be able to catch the 12 . 10 train .
it wouldn' t be a bad idea to change the charge against oberst .
he was nowhere near the scene of the crime , and i think he can prove it .
i bet you know when colbert was killed .
about 12 . 30 .
while harvey was still shooting pool .
wait a minute .
i' il get it .
there' s cue chalk under his nails , not dried blood .
thank god i don' t live in philadelphia .
one more thing .
colbert wasn' t killed where the body was found .
what do you mean ?
he was killed then moved to main street .
courtney ?
yes , sir ?
change the charge to theft .
d' you mean harve ?
who the hell else do we have back there ? !
yes , sir .
hey .
didn' t i ask you to fix that gate ?
no , not me , sir .
must have been my brother harold .
he' s on days .
harold .
police department .
yes , he' s here .
hold on , sir .
mayor' s on the line , chief .
what' s all this miz colbert' s been tellin ' me about a ... a cover up arrest ?
no , ma' am .
we ain' t had no cover up .
in fact , we just dropped the charges for insufficient evidence .
miz colbert , i told you he was nobody' s man .
i came by to make it as clear as i possibly can that i do not want that negro officer taken off this case .
negro officer ?
yeah , well , he , uh ...
he comes from up north , you see .
and he was , uh , kinda ...
passin ' through ...
lf it wasn' t for him , your impartial chief of police would still have the wrong man behind bars .
i want that officer given a free hand .
otherwise , i will pack up my husband' s engineers ...
and leave you ... to yourselves .
miz colbert , now don' t you worry about a thing .
believe me , we' re gonna take care of everything .
bill ?
i wanna see you come through this now , you hear ?
even if we have to step on endicott' s toes ?
even that .
but do it fast .
all right .
now , bill , how about this here negro officer ?
miz colbert seems to have confidence in him .
oh , he ain' t nothin ' .
some kind of a ... some kind of a homicide expert .
but i don' t need him .
you mean you don' t want him .
but you do need him .
now look , bill .
suppose he turns up the killer .
he has no police power here .
he' s gonna have to hand him over on a platter , right ?
that' s right .
and if he fails , you' re off the hook , cos it was miz colbert' s idea in the first place .
see what i mean ?
oh , yeah .
works out all the way around , bill .
for all of us .
excuse me .
any reason why you have to leave today ?
there' s lots of reasons .
what would you say if i asked you to stay for a while ?
no .
this town needs a factory , virgil .
colbert come down from chicago to build it .
i hear they' re gonna hire a thousand men .
half of them' d be coloured .
know what that means ?
probably got him killed .
that' s what mrs. colbert thinks .
she wants us to catch her a killer .
no killer , no factory .
well , it' s a lotta jobs for a lotta coloured people .
you follow me ?
i' m going home , man .
they' re your people .
not mine yours .
you made this scene .
what do you want me to do ?
beg you ?
look , i' ve had your town up to here !
boy , it would give me a world of satisfaction to horsewhip you , virgil !
my father used to say that .
even did , once or twice .
yeah , well , not enough to suit me .
now you listen to me .
just once in my life i' m gonna hold my temper .
i' m tellin ' you that you' re gonna stay .
you' il stay here if i have to have your chief remind you what he told you to do .
but i don' t think i have to do that , you see ?
no .
because you' re so damned smart .
you' re smarter than any white man .
you' re just gonna stay here and show us all .
you could never live with yourself unless you could put us all to shame .
you wanna know something , virgil ?
i don' t think that you could let an opportunity like that pass by .
jess ?
jess , this is , uh ...
this is virgil .
he' s workin ' for me .
give him somethin ' that runs .
fix him up .
what i fix , runs .
who pays ?
police .
well , you know where to find me .
what you doin ' here , man ?
policeman .
you' re a policeman here in sparta ?
they' ve got a murder they don' t know what to do with .
they need a whipping boy .
you got a roof ?
no .
i' il find a motel .
viola ...
we got company .
know what' s gonna happen ?
he gonna get hisself killed .
you watch and see he don' t .
i' m aware of the risk , tom .
but , like it or not , we' re stuck with him .
not if the chief here is right on the ball .
what do you say , chief ?
you got that old killer all lined up in your front sights , hm ?
i' m workin ' on it .
tom , climb off of gillespie' s back now .
you know damn well we didn' t hire him off a homicide squad .
yeah , well , it' s gonna be his week .
cos colbert' s only the start .
i say this nigger won' t live past saturday .
mrs. colbert , can you tell me about your husband' s enemies ?
that' s endicott .
he' s been fighting us all the way .
he sits up on his hill and runs this county .
or did , until we moved in .
did your husband tell you where he was going last night ?
he said he wasn' t sleepy .
i went to bed .
what time was that ?
a little after 11 , i think .
did he call you , or anybody on your staff , after 11 ?
no .
maybe the elevator boy can tell us what time he went out .
they put it on self service after ten .
did your husband use a car here ?
find anything ?
whoever killed colbert drove this car .
how do you know ?
where you goin ' ?
i' d drive up there , but i' m sure you don' t want me running up there by myself .
up where ?
eric endicott' s .
endicott' s ? !
come on , now !
none of that for you , huh , virgil ?
in the heat of the night
mm hm , ain' t a woman yet been born
yeah
knows how to make the mornin ' come
it s so hard to keep control
yes , it is
when i could sell my soul
for just a little light
in the heat of the night
listen .
you know something i don' t know ?
i found a piece of osmunda in colbert' s car .
a piece of what ?
on the brake pedal .
osmunda .
fern root .
fern root ?
oh , is mr. endicott here ?
yes , sir .
he' s out in the greenhouse .
would you follow me , please ?
gillespie .
mr. endicott .
this here' s virgil .
mr. tibbs .
how do you do , sir ?
oh , may i have henry fetch you somethin ' ?
some light refreshment ?
no , thank you .
we' re all right ...
i' il have something cold , soft .
anything .
henry , bring in a pitcher of lemonade .
i' il have one , too .
yes , sir .
i didn' t know it was possible to grow this species locally .
oh , you like flowers ?
i do .
mr. tibbs , do you know anything about orchids ?
not very much , but i do like them .
well , let me show you .
endicott' s folly .
what do you think ?
it s beautiful .
it s breathtaking .
have you a favourite , mr. tibbs ?
well , i' m partial to any of the epiphytics .
why , isn' t that remarkable !
that of all the orchids in this place , you should prefer the epiphytics .
i wonder if you know why .
maybe it would be helpful if you' d tell me .
because , like the negro , they need care and feedin ' and cultivatin ' .
and that takes time .
that' s somethin ' you can' t make some people understand .
that' s somethin ' mr. colbert didn' t realise .
is this what the epiphytics root in ?
my point !
they thrive on it .
take it away from them , they do poorly .
what do you call this material ?
that' s osmunda .
fern root .
well , we don' t wanna take any more of your time , mr. endicott .
why' d you two come here ?
to ask you about mr. colbert .
let me understand this .
you two came here ... to question me ?
well , your ... your attitudes , mr. endicott , your points of view , are a matter of record .
some people let us say the people who work for mr. colbert might reasonably regard you as the person least likely to mourn his passing .
we were just trying to clarify some of the evidence .
was mr. colbert ever in this greenhouse ?
say , last night , about midnight ?
gillespie ?
yeah ?
you saw it .
oh , i saw it .
what are you gonna do about it ?
i don' t know .
i' il remember that .
there was a time ... when i could have had you shot .
you better clear out .
and i mean fast !
what about that speech you gave me ?
i didn' t know you' d slap any white man !
least of all endicott !
all right .
give me another day .
two days .
i' m close .
i can pull that fat cat down .
i can bring him right off this hill !
oh , boy .
man , you' re just like the rest of us .
ain' t ya ?
it s all my fault .
but there' s no point in ducking it .
it s gonna be tough to keep you in your job now .
now look here , bill .
i don' t have to tell you how urgent it is to get tibbs outta town .
no .
i already told him to go .
all right .
now , miz colbert is not gonna be back till thursday .
you catch your guilty party by then , she won' t hold it against us we had to send tibbs home for his own good .
but you gotta do it , you hear ?
i hear .
bill ?
what' s made you change your mind about tibbs ?
who says i have ?
last chief we had , he' d have shot tibbs one second after he slapped endicott , claimed self defence .
gillespie here .
courtney here , sir .
did you take virgil down the depot ?
no , sir .
he just plain wouldn' t go .
shagbag saw him headin ' to river road .
check .
hey !

foul owl on the prowl
lf you hear him hoot scoot

i guess so !
whoa .
all right , virgil .
just what the hell do you want ?
i wanna know exactly where sam was at all times on the night of the murder .
lf you pass his tree flee
lf you catch his eye fly
virgil , if you get killed , we' il have one hell of a mess in this town .
you know that ?
i know .
got some real luscious cream pie for you tonight , sam .
i mean officer wood .
just like you always order .
you know i don' t eat that stuff .
the chief likes his boys streamlined .
right , chief ?
why don' t you shut up , sam ?
all right , what' il you have , virgil ?
i ain' t servin ' him !
tuesday night you walked out of here at 2 . 40 .

two minutes from now .
that' s for him .
now , what' d you do when you came out that night ?
well , i picked up the radio and called in .
do it , please .
go ahead .
go ahead .
uh ...

i' m leavin ' compton' s now .
sam , look sharp .
gillespie' s sniffin ' around .
gimme that thing !
courtney , your brother says i didn' t tell him to fix that hinge , so i told you .
do you read me , courtney ?
oh , i' il get right on it , chief .
i' d do that if i were you .
yes , sir .
ten four .
all right , you can move us .
officer wood .
why' d you do that , sam ?
do what ?
change your route back there at the corner .
who says i changed ?
look , i oughta know what i did !
chief , do i have to put up with this ?
do i work for you , or do i work for him ?
good night , gentlemen .
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
well , i appreciate anything you can do .
this is highly irregular .
yeah , i know that .
showing our depositors ' accounts ?
hm .
i don' t know .
you sure this is an official request ?
yes .
it s official , yes .
you willing to put that in writing ?
yeah .
i' il put it in writing .
on police department letterhead ?
i would write it on the head of a pin if you want it there .
i gotta have somethin ' for the file .
i realise that , but i' m in a hurry .
well , we' il see .
he' s had an account with us for several years now .
that so ?
not a large account .
never more than ...
yeah .
$208 .
that was back in ' 62 .
september .
i am not interested in ' 62 september .
i am interested in yesterday .
yesterday ?
well ...
well .
according to this , he made a deposit of ... $632 .
yesterday ?
yes .
thank you .
must have been when i was out to lunch .
a deposit that size , i' d remember .
oh , you' il send me that letter for the file , you hear ?
i' il tell you , baby brother , the chief didn' t like him , not even from the first .
morning .
where do you think you' re goin ' ?
it s all right .
let him go .
i just talked to the fbi lab .
we can prove colbert was in that greenhouse .
endicott' s covering up .
i' m afraid you' re too late .
we already got the guilty man .
who ?
sam .
sam ?
that' s right .
our man is endicott .
you just think a minute .
didn' t you catch sam in a lie last night ?
and yesterday he makes a big cash deposit at the bank .
lf i told you once , i told you a hundred times that i won that matchin ' quarters and halves .
it took me three years !
then why was it in big bills ?
i checked .
because whenever i got enough change , i' d trade it in on $20 bills .
and when i got up to $600 , i took it down and put it in the bank .
the day colbert was killed , he cashed a cheque for $900 , $600 of which is gone , $300 of which i believe you left in the wallet as bait for some kid like oberst !
what kinda man do you think i am ? !
now , don' t you push me , boy !
now listen .
lf you weren' t suspicious of sam here , why did you question him last night when he changed his route ?
i knew why he changed his route .
knew what ?
he was afraid i' d see some naked white girl down the block .
what ?
some girl named delores purdy .
she parades around in the nude at night to get her kicks .
that' s ...
how do you know ?
i know .
well , i know .
do you understand ?
i know that colbert cashed a cheque for $900 .
i know that sam made a big cash deposit .
i know that you caught him in a lie .
and i know that' s enough for me .
c' mon , sam .
martin , lock him up .
well ?
well ... you' re making a mistake .
don' t you bet against it .
you can catch your train now , virgil .
tibbs ?
do you think sam did it ?
where do i find the chief ?
what' s it all about ?
my business .
hey , look , purdy .
now , you got a complaint ?
well , right here' s where you file it .
what i got to say , i say to the chief .
it s about sam wood .
all right .
yeah ?
purdy' s out here , sir .
it s about sam .
all right .
send him in .
she is gonna have a baby .
sam wood' s baby .
well , ask her yourself if you don' t believe me !
what are you doin ' here ?
it s important that i hear this .
i ain' t talkin ' about this with him in the room .
boy , you don' t want trouble , you get !
you be sensible .
i' m a police officer .
you gonna get him outta here , or do i gotta do it ? !
you ain' t gonna do nothin ' .
you just stand there and shut up .
sit down , little girl .
all right , now .
you tell me ... all about it .
just tell me how it happened .
oh , come on .
come on , girl , speak !
well , you know how hot it' s been .
yeah .
nights , they aren' t any better .
my brother works nights .
he leaves me all alone .
this particular night , i go out on the porch .
i' m thinkin ' how nice it' d be if i had a fountain drink .
sam comes down our road .
just like he comes every night .
passin ' like a lord in that fine , big , shiny car .
only , this time he stops .
he' s got a nice face , don' t you think , chief ?
so he stopped .
he says ...
what ?
i didn' t hear what you said .
he says ...
hey , little girl , you know what the coolest spot in town is ?
and i said " no , sam .
i guess i don' t .
and he said ...
the cemetery .
that' s where .
know why ?
cos they got all of them big , cool tombstones .
ever stretch out on a tombstone , delores ?
feel all that nice , cool marble along your body ?
he said that ?
you hear , chief ?
you hear ?
yeah , i hear .
i hear .
all right .
sam comes along and stops in front of your house and talks .
what else ?
well , come on now , girl .
what else ?
what else ?
what else ?
then i went for a ride with him .
where' d you go ?
the cemetery .
so , wood took you to the cemetery in the patrol car , right ?
and then things went a bit too far .
is that what you' re sayin ' ?
did they get a little bit outta line ?
come on now .
is that what you' re tryin ' to say ?
come on , girl !
is it or ain' t it ?
yeah , they went too far !
well , fine !
now , i got one more question .
very important .
did he force you , or did you let him ?
don' t mean a damn whether she let him or not !
she is still 16 !
in this state , that' s rape !
i know the plain law on that !
i know the laws in the state of mississippi , thank you !
are you sure you' re pregnant ?
yes , i am pregnant !
courtney !
yes , sir ?
better get in here with a pad and a pencil .
come on in .
i want you to take this all down .
you had no right to keep a nigger in the room , shame my little sister .
you had no right .
virge , what' s happenin ' ?
hi , harve .
how are you ?
fine .
man , uh ...
you sure saved my hide .
listen , harvey .
man , uh ...
lf a guy knocks up a girl in this town , where can he go for help ?
barbershop .
barbershop ?
borrow mr. fanning' s razor and cut your throat !
well ...
but suppose mr. fanning' s razor is too dull .
suppose he' s got some real money to spread around .
uh ...
well , uh ...
there used to be a coloured gal .
but she kept bumpin ' her price , and i don' t know if she' s still in business .
what' s her name ?
well , i ain' t never had to look her up .
but , uh ...
packy might know .
where do i find packy ?
down at the pool hall .
but , man , he wouldn' t tell you .
not unless i say so .
and how am i gonna say so locked up in here ?
suppose i get word to packy that you wanna see him ?
have him come here ?
will you let him bring me a cheeseburger ?
onions ?
now you' re talkin ' !
uh ...
virge ?
a little careless , ain' t you , virgil ?
parked in the road , you could get yourself killed .
anybody' d know where you are .
you know what this land is ?
yeah .
it s the site for the new factory .
i found a piece of wood in colbert' s scalp .
the lab identified it as pine .
three people saw colbert drive by alone on the way back from endicott' s .
colbert must have picked up somebody in town and then come out here .
i tell you he didn' t pick up nobody .
sam followed him here , come up behind him , just like i come up behind you .
i heard you .
colbert would have too .
he turned and he got smashed !
he was hit from behind !
lf delores purdy hadn' t come in , i never would have seen the truth .
i was hung up trying to get endicott , for personal reasons .
do you know what i' m gonna do , virgil ?
i' m gonna take you to brownsville and put you on the bus myself .
you aren' t taking me anywhere .
you dig ?
you' re holding the wrong man !
the wrong man ? !
i got the motive , which is money , and the body , which is dead !
what makes you so sure ?
why do you doubt it ? !
because colbert was killed here !
then driven back to town in his own car and dumped on the streets .
sam couldn' t have driven two cars !
what do you want ?
give me till morning .
you know ...
you know , virgil , you are among the chosen few .
how' s that ?
well , i think that you' re the first human being that' s ever been in here .
well , you can' t be too careful , man .
you know a lotta things , don' t you ?
well , just what do you know about insomnia ?
bourbon can' t cure it .
well ... that' s for sure .
now look .
i got no wife .
i got no kids .
boy , i got a town that ... don' t want me .
and i got an air conditioner that i have to oil myself , and a desk with a busted leg .
and on top of that , i got ... this , uh ... place .
now , don' t you think that' d drive a man to takin ' a few drinks ?
i' il tell you a secret .
nobody comes here .
never .
you married ?
no .
ever been ?
no .
ever been close to it ?
close to it .
don' t you get just ... a little lonely ?
no lonelier than you , man .
oh , now , don' t get smart , black boy .
i don' t need it .
no pity , thank you .
no , thank you !
yeah ?
chief ?
yeah .
you know where i can find virgil ?
who are you ?

yeah .

that' s her place , here .
you want me to wait ?

i thought that' s who you was .
why you wanna do that ?

they stealin ' your soul .
they chew you up and spit you out .
i' m not here to lay a finger on you , mama .

that cracker ?
where' d he come off getting 600 ?
he killed mr. colbert .
you gone crazy out of your mind .
now listen .

when i left her house , i was going to the diner .
mr. colbert drove by , so i hitched a ride with him .
that' s all .
i said " i sure would like a job in that new factory once you get started .
and he said " sure . " and i said " well , i wonder where it' s gonna be .
he said that field we were comin ' up to was it , and he would stop and show me .
i said to myself " man , he' s askin ' for it .
i said " now , ralph , all you gotta do when we get out ... is just sneak up behind him and just ... tap him .
and then just claim that somebody jumped us from the bushes .
that' s all .
i didn' t mean to kill him .
yeah .
