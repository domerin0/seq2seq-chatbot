por que estas aqui ?
no , not te me ...
porque estas aqui ?
no , no , no , que estas haciendo .
dowd !
no !
no !
no !
mommy , mommy !
please , help me .
please , help me .
please !
it' s okay .
help ... !
mr. dowd was pronounced dead on arrival , detroit sinai .
perforated cranial pan , projectile fragmentation ... frontal lobe .
now , the woman , jeanine mueller , she subsequently lost the child .
uterine damage , hemorrhaging on admittance .
the infant died due to blood loss suffered by the mother .
hospital records indicate acute fetal trauma , gunshot wound .
this material was covered some months ago .
why is it being brought up again ?
have you had contact with ms. mueller ?
i have spoken to her , yes .
on what occasion did you speak with ms. mueller , and what prompted the conversation ?
i' m not going to answer that .
that' s a personal ...
do you think , in retrospect , acting perhaps less aggressively , this might have been prevented ?
what might have been prevented ?
the infant' s death .
that' s very dangerous , you know that ?
hungry ?
yeah , but not for this ... toe cheese .
shh !
i' il bite it off .
he' s going to wake up .
if the smell didn' t wake him up already , he' s out .
my feet smell ?
yeah .
yeah .
hi .
so .
so , what ?
so , how' d it go ?
it went .
yeah ?
what can i say ?
what did you say ?
what do you think ?
ma' am , let me just , uh ...
sorry , your name , again ?
liz detmer .
right , right , ms. detmer .
my , uh , duty assignment was solely undercover narcotic work .
do you have any idea what that entails ?
i have a general idea , yes .
okay .
well , then , generally speaking , ms. detmer , you don' t know what the fuck you' re talking about .
they expect you to come in with this , " glad to be here " bullshit , head hung low , hat in hand .
yeah , that' s ridiculous .
well , they' re not going to forget .
it' s all what they say .
then i don' t understand why , you know , you went and talked to them .
' cause they asked .
mr. tellis , that' s not necessary .
if you haven' t seen what i' ve seen , or done what i' ve done , you don' t know where i' m coming from .
i am not an officer of the law , mr. tellis , and , therefore , i have no formal training .
but i would expect someone that did would perhaps behave judiciously , exercising discretion and restraint in necessary quantities ...
jesus christ , lady .
look , we can do this all goddamn day .
you want to assess all this blame ?
i' m going to call you on it .
so what is this ?
i mean , i can make it very simple for you .
you want to talk ?
i' il talk .
i have no problem with that .
but if this becomes some half ass ambush , and you' re putting me under the lamp ,
i will walk .
now .
are you familiar with the michael calvess case ?
uh ...
yes .
he was murdered .
yes , i' m aware of that .
this investigation , as you may or may not know , has stretched over 60 days , and failed to produce any tangible evidence or yield a single suspect .
it has not , however , deterred or diminished our efforts to apprehend and punish those responsible .
throughout your undercover stint , you maintained prolonged contact with the city' s drug element .
would that be an accurate statement ?
i had some relationships .
is it fair to say , given your rather abrupt discharge from the ranks 18 months ago , that your cover and those contacts might remain intact ?
we feel that your presence in this investigation would be invaluable , and would warrant complete reinstatement , homicide division , detective grade .
when the suspects are caught and charged , and a verdict rendered , you would be eligible for the assignment of your choosing , commensurate to sentencing .
no .
i' m sorry ?
i' m not interested .
bear in mind , mr. tellis , if i may be so bold , that career opportunities in law enforcement ...
what a fucking waste of time that was .
tellis !
captain mitchell cheevers .
thanks for coming down , man .
oh , sure .
come on , listen , i want to apologize for in there , okay ?
they get paid to put people on the spot .
they made their money today .
all right , come on , hey , hold on .
you' re going to make me fucking chase you ?
come on , give me ten seconds .
go ahead .
calvess was a cop .
yeah .
okay , he didn' t deserve this .
nobody does .
fine , good , then help me out .
what ?
come on , help me catch these motherfuckers .
man , just come down here .
just just look at the files , would you ?
help me out .
i think that' s ten .
time' s up .
for who ?
what the fuck else are you going to do ?
they offering you something ?
they asked me to look at some files .
shit .
i swear to god .
yeah , files .
why ?
' cause they got a dead cop and dead ends and they' re reaching .
this welfare pension bullshit is not going to cut it .
i know that .
you just do something else , then .
what ?
i do something else ?
yeah .
okay .
what would that be ?
hey , sergeant , has , uh ,
michael calvess ' personal effects cleared yet ?
yeah .
lieutenant oak , per departmental mandate is restricted from participating in the calvess investigation any further .
that' s the log line , and ... that' s the way it' s been worded to me .
why is that ?
well ... he and calvess were close .
he' d been on collateral narcotic investigations for over a year .
he was the first one in the tunnel that day .
he discovered the body .
i like him .
i do .
he' s got a 93 % conviction rate .
he' s swingin ' a big stick .
he makes solid collars that make solid cases .
but ... between you and me , he' s not stable .
you don' t even know what the fuck you' re planning on , man .
come on .
yeah .
you' re an idiot .
you don' t even know .
you ought to know ...
he' s all of that shit a cop just cannot be , not right now .
not in this city .
not in this department .
we' re talking about a marked name .
henry , what the fuck , man ? !
i swear to fucking god , if i get another call you' re beating on your wife and kids , you' re fucking dead !
get off me !
get the fuck off me !
get off !
shit !
what the fuck !
go get this piece of shit out of here !
i mean , listen , captain , we can both sit here and say , or we can assume that he' s just adhering to this department ban on his involvement .
you' re a smart guy .
you know that' s bullshit .
well , i would hope so .
yes , but again ... it' s only a matter of time before iad brings down an indictment on him .
listen , do yourself a favor , concerning oak , um ...
i would just blow out all this bullshit , go to convicts and ethics inquiries , and hinge this whole thing on his involvement .
would that be up to and including your own involvement ?
i don' t understand .
nick , if i go to bat for him ,
i' m going to have to do it contingent on you being his partner for the duration .
the duration of what ?
the duration of the investigation .
hey , you asked me to read some files , and i did .
you know , the tale of the tape is ... and this is nothing you don' t already know ... is that your best shot at breaking this is bringing him back on , and just go off the work he' s already done .
i don' t want to waste any more time .
do you want on this case roster ... yes or no ?
i am not looking for active assignment .
i don' t ...
i i want a paycheck ... okay ?
i mean , this three quarters is not cutting the shit .
i don' t need , i don' t want ...
i don' t want to be out with some guy playing nine ball on some perp' s skull .
i' il tell you that .
i want a desk .
i need a desk .
fine .
get me a conviction , i' il get you a desk .
like that ?
just like that .
why don' t we get some coffee ?
you must be somebody' s something special .
no , not really .
no , not really ?
getting them to reassign me to a case that i' d been so resoundedly removed from ?
you got to admit , that takes some people to pull .
it' s not what i did .
it' s what you did .
the work you put in .
they know they' re better off with you than without you .
i' m just going to say this , all right ?
i don' t know you , so i refuse to fuck around with you any more than i have to .
did internal affairs set you up with this ?
no .
no ?
fringe ex cop fallen out of favor ,
iooking to get back behind a badge ?
they got files three feet thick on guys like you .
they bunted you on a reflex .
probably , but i' m telling you the truth .
you weren' t approached or asked in any way to keep tabs on me for ia ?
no , i was not .
hey , i don' t blame you for asking .
you don' t do what i did and just waltz back in .
now what does that tell you ?
that tells me that this investigation is running on fucking fumes .
don' t get confused thinking that this is about calvess .
i know it' s not .
this is all politics .
this is political appointments , it' s referendums , it' s squashing a race riot .
you think those assholes upstairs give a shit and a shake about michael calvess ?
they didn' t know him , they don' t care about him , and they can' t forget about him fast enough .
the only thing you need to know about me is that i' m going to bag the motherfuckers that killed mike .
if that means breaking every point of procedure , then they' re broke .
it' s because his life was worth a little bit more than a wreath and a rifle salute .
you understand ?
no , it' s just me .
and what about you ?
what about me ?
well , why you coming back to this shit ?
cops die daily , and they die bad .
what makes mike the exception ?
i don' t know .
you don' t know ?
just something to do ?
something .
i know what time it is , but you can still give me a kiss .
audrey , i don' t want to get into this with you right now .
i just want to go to sleep .
i just want to lay down next to you , and go right to sleep .
you want to kick my ass all over in the morning , that' s ... that' s fine , but ...
i just want to ...
i' m fucking beat , man .

so he mentions this jimmy fredricks , and cheevers told us to route this through you .
and what' s he saying ?

we used to run raids on his ass every other day .

puta sucia de la vagallado !
i i i love you , baby !

i love you !
fuck you !
that' s a good woman .
what do you know about this leflore ,
' cause his name doesn' t do anything for me .
there' s no mention of him in any of mike' s duty summaries .
there' s no f. i. card on him .
he' s just a nickle bagger i ran across maybe half a dozen times .
he' s got two whole hobbies ... ganja and guns .
other than that , he' s a fucking bore .
but i guarantee he' s got outstanding warrants .
you want to run him ?
lay down on the floor , this is the police !
go .
oh .
nick !
you doing good ?
oh , yeah .
sorry i didn' t make ...
i couldn' t get to gabe' s birthday party .
it' s just ...
i just had a lot of stuff to do .
don' t worry about it , we didn' t miss you .
thanks for the present , anyway .
yeah , well ...
nick tellis , this is a really good friend of mine , art harlan .
how you doing ?
he works with the coroner' s office .
so i hear your name on the call , and this one i have to see .
what' d you do , drown him ?
no , this might have to do with mike .
calvess ?
yeah .
what the hell you doing with that ?
i thought they were closing it out ?
no , not yet .
okay , thanks , guys .
it' s good .
rub a dub dub .
wow .
he' s been here for a while .
how long you think ?
i' m guessing he' s sitting in this ... two , three weeks .
that long ?
oh , yeah .
he' s ripe .
okay , subject has distended bloat , upper , lower torso .
clotting and ... hematoma discoloration .
hello .
what is it ?
a tooth .
oh , my god .
back molar .
blasted it right out of his head .
well , most of his mandible was shattered , along with the rest of the dental palette , so iding him outright' s going to be a little tricky .
sorry .
what do you got there ?
looks like a mossberg , sg 6 shot .
i don' t know how the fuck he got this .
what ?
why ?
it' s tactical issue , metro pd .
swat team uses it .
it looks like the serial number' s been filed down .
let me see that .
definitely looks like our man opted out with it .
no question about that .
oh , damn !
i don' t know about that .
well , not on purpose .
why ?
what do you mean ?
there' s no firing pin mark on the casing .
boy never even pulled the trigger .
hmm .
so what do you think happened ?
i' m stretching here , but ... knowing old leo ,
i think maybe he was high out of his fucking mind , reaches for the bong , goes down , breaks ...
his lazy ass is not getting out of this warm water , so ... he sees the gauge , maybe , and takes a little green bud , decides to pop it in the breach , fires it up , starts toking away , forgets there' s a shell in the pipe , flame hits the firing cap .
that' s beautiful .
bubble bath , earful of tunes , smoking some hub , and this is how the evening ends !
art .
that' s fucking fantastic .
that still doesn' t explain the mossberg .
i don' t know how he got that .
well ... if it is tact ordinance , it could be an underground buy .
i mean , their armory' s been broken into a few times .
yeah , it could be .
or he could' ve known a cop .
or somebody who knew a cop .
what do you want to do about this ?
nothing .
just let art finish up .
recovery sweep through , if they find something good , if they get a stolen weapons hit , great .
what we came here to do is corroborate ruiz ' story , which we obviously can' t do .
that' s all right .
i think it was all bullshit anyway .
hey , art , i' il talk to you later .
okeydoke .
i hear bubbles .
i hear bubbles .
uh oh .
what are you guys doing up ?
we had a deal , i thought , you and me , there ?
so you want to talk about this now , or you want to wait or what ?
i i don' t know .
what are we going to talk about ?
oh , my god , what could we have to talk about ?
you know what ?
i can' t believe that you' re out there again .
and don' t say that you' re not or give me any of that crap .
what are you talking about ?
there' s hours involved .
i' m sorry .
there are .
what do you want me to tell you ?
why don' t you tell me who uttered that fucking famous , uh ,
this job' il either burn you out or bury you " ?
do you remember saying that ?
yeah , it' s narcotics , audrey ...
you know , i' m just curious .
how bad you think that it was , huh ?
tell me what you remember ,
' cause i' il tell you what i remember .
five months pregnant , being in a detox tank with you .
what the fuck is this coming from ?
not sleeping and watching you ...
what does that have to fucking do with anything , huh ? ... climb the walls .
do you remember that ?
i' m a little late for bath time ?
well , excuse me .
i' ve been giving him one every day for seven months !
your acting like this is no big thing ,
like you can just jump in and then just jump out again .
it is a big thing , all right .
it' s a fucking big thing !
yeah , it' s two weeks work , is what it is .
you know what , that' s bullshit .
that is ...
that is bullshit !
that' s all you want me to think that it is .
you know , the other day i asked you why you wanted to do this , and you said that you didn' t know .
well , you know what ?
i got news for you .
you need to know , and you need to let me know ,
' cause for the life of me ,
i' m looking at you hold your son and i can' t understand , do you understand ?
i can' t understand why you would ever feel the need to go back to that again .
yeah , what if it was me who got wasted out there , audrey ?
that wasn' t you .
what if it was ?
that wasn' t ...
what if it was !
there are other people aside from you , okay ?
you' re a little three foot circle .
you know what , that' s really unfair .
they had this kid beaten half dead .
they could' ve walked away .
anyone could' ve .
instead ... they took the gun , and they blew half his head off , okay ?
i know , i' m sorry , i' m sorry , baby .
i' m sorry , i' m sorry , i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
you were right about the mossberg .
definitely was one of ours .
lab pulled partial prints off of it .
one set belonged to leflore , the other set belonged to this gang banger , latroy steeds .
it' s just that he' s got a bunch of drug shit .
just did 30 days in wayne county .
got out a week ago .
do we know where he' s at ?
s t e e d s.
larry , you' re his parole officer .
he hasn' t ... ?
not once ?
all right .
well , let me know if he shows , okay ?
no problem , you got it .
he hasn' t checked in once .
here , go on .
let' s sit on the house , see if he shows up .
come on , go , go , go , go , go , go , go , go , go !
let' s move it out here !
how long you been married , nick ?
uh ... about a year and a half .
got any kids ?
yeah , one .
i got a boy ... a big baby boy .
hmm .
almost ten months .
that' s nice .
how long you been with your wife ?
um ...
i lost her .
we were married just shy of 16 years .
she had cancer .
i didn' t know .
i' m sorry .
no ...
i thought ...
it' s okay .
we were talking wives .
you have one .
i had one .
i' ve been asked before .
probably' d be easier on people if i took my ring off , but ...
... because we' d avoid these embarrassing little moments , but it' s okay .
i like talking about her .
the first detail i had was ... was vice .
i wanted robbery/ homicide , but ...
i caught vice .
i worked vice .
i hated it .
mm hmm .
just hated it .
you know , i rode it to the seams , hoping to leapfrog out of there , but ... no good .
no dice .
and i' d come home , just in bad shape .
just pissed off .
that' s when i first started getting an ulcer .
just miserable .
and i' d lie down in her lap ... and she' d rub my head .
some nights , she' d sing me to sleep .
i' d just lie there , staring at her .
still the best place i' ve ever been .
i became a much better cop the day she died .
and any half step , any hesitation
i had about the job was gone .
i see a dead bolted door , i break it down and be the first one in the room .
i started working joint task force .
the head crack , hang wrecking crew .
zombie squad .
it was a diversion .
it was just a way to keep from thinking about her .
i remember one night ... ... i went with the sheriffs on a warrant raid .
this dipshit was selling meth out of his apartment .
it was just a stop and pop .
broke down the door , rousted the guy .
i was in one of the back rooms looking for junk .
and i hear something .
i turn around , and see these ... these eyes staring at me from a closet .
it was a little girl .
a little ten year old girl ... naked .
shaking like a leaf .
she was scared to death .
her stepfather was pimping her out for rent .
wrapped her in my coat ... carried her out to the squad car .
i went back .
and i beat that motherfucker half to death .
i thought of my wife .
i thought of the baby we never had .
all the things about her that i hung onto .
' cause a little girl being brutalized , a little girl being abused has got nothing to do with the rules and regulations , and everything to do with right and wrong .
it' s the same thing with calvess .
why is he the cookie monster ?
he loves cookies .
' cause , like , every time in the morning
i want cookies for dessert ... gone , no cookies left .
no ?
none .
' cause he eats them all .
yep .
he eats cookies for breakfast .
he eats cookies for dinner .
he eats cookies for lunch .
he eats cookies for ... anything .
this one won' t let me out of her sight .
she drags her dad' s t shirt around with her wherever she goes .
can you say hi to the man ?
shy .
she' s a little doll , though .
honey , you can go .
i want to thank you , kathryn , for letting me come by .
oh , it was not a problem .
thank you for bringing his things .
i wasn' t too thrilled about going through them , but i' m glad you brought them .
i haven' t seen some of these pictures for a long time .
you have to forgive me , because i' m pretty convinced that any way i go about this is the wrong way , so ...
no , please .
i don' t mind answering questions .
did you know mike ?
no , i didn' t .
i never got the chance to meet him .
i wish i had .
i know his reputation , though .
hmm .
but what i need to ... know more of , i i think ...
you know , what i' m lacking ... is ...
well , i worked undercover narcotics for two and a half years myself , so i know that life can be very difficult .
i know that it can be ... very problematic , especially with a ... with a family .
you know , maybe i ...
maybe not .
baby , can you go check on your sister for mommy ?
go check on your sister .
what are you asking me now ?
well , um ...
i know it' s personal ... ... but did things at work adversely affect things here ?
here at home ?
no .
did he tell you what it was that he was doing ?
yes .
did that seem to bother him ?
did it bother you ?
yes , it did .
well , there you have it .
you notice anything about his mood in the weeks before ?
was there anything strange about his behavior ?
no .
did he mention any names ?
maybe there were some people that he was dealing with that ... came out ?
no .
i remember the day that mike was killed .
i was putting the girls to bed , and i heard a knock .
and when i opened the door ...
henry was standing there with tears in his eyes .
and i knew right away that he was gone .
and i remember running back to the girls ' room , and sitting on the edge of their bed and just ... ... staring at them .
i needed to see his face .
mom , somebody' s at the door .
where ?
where ?
hi !
hi .
come here , you .
how are you ?
give me a kiss .
where' s my kiss ?
there' s someone here .
he' s been asking me questions about mike .
what ?
i need to talk to you outside right now .
i' il be right back , okay ?
okay .
what the fuck you doing talking to her without me being here ? !
i brought her husband' s things over .
yeah , and you questioned her .
what for ?
what for ? !
is this " mother , may i ?
we said we were going to do some of this on our own , right ?
some of this doesn' t extend to her , and don' t get fucking cute with me !
take your hand out of my face .
if you need to know what she said about anything case related , you refer to the file !
yeah , i looked at the files .
they' re thin .
what you don' t fucking do is talk to her without notifying me in advance !
that' s not the way we do things !
why is that ?
what' s the problem with me speaking to her ?
because the problem is every fucking question you asked her , she' s already answered !
she' s been badgered and bothered by cops and cop questions for two fucking months now , and the biggest fucking problem is her husband is fucking dead !
you understand ? !
i understand that .
great .
don' t let it happen again .
it' s the meanest crowd ever tonight .
it' s like the roman coliseum in here .
no to babies .
are you insane ?
it' s burnback .
it' s like a table scrap junk that they stew in a freebase and then shoot .
it killed this guy dandridge i told you about .
well , i think they were trying to sell the same shit to calvess .
yeah ?
tellis ?
mason in records .
hey , what' s going on ?
hey , i got the stuff .

it doesn' t matter to me in the least , but i' m about to tell you what does matter , and you' re about to fucking listen
like your life depended on it .
fuck .
what the fuck , man ?
a month ago , an undercover officer was murdered ... pedestrian tunnel off houston and west grand .
they beat him up , they put a gun to his fucking head , and put a bullet through it .
i don' t want to hear any shit about what you don' t know or what you didn' t do , because we both know you ain' t got the nut sack for something that size , so , i' m fucking positive you didn' t kill him .
his name was michael calvess .
take a gander , there , buddy .
hold on a minute , man .
y' all motherfuckers come up in my fucking crib , and shit , want to throw fucking hot sauce and blind my fucking ass , and now you want me to help you ?
street name jimmy fredricks .
fucking crazy ?
i know you know .
oh , my bad .
you know you know .
my bad .
i know this motherfucker .
i think i might' ve let him suck on my dick once or twice .
come here , come here .
you want to be bounced back to county , keep it up !
i' il have you wearing half shirts and halter tops , braiding some nigger' s hair !
piece of shit !
oh , fuck , man , i think i' m bleeding , man .
you going to act like a punk , you' re going to get played like one .
now , listen very , very carefully .
they found smack at the murder scene .
a mean fucking mix .
now , you took some of this exact same stuff about ten months ago , and it nearly killed your dumb ass .
you don' t have the chemistry or the sense god gave goats , which means you didn' t do the cook .
now , dowd is dead , so , who sold to you ?
whatever , man .
you going to tell us ?
no ?
you think you' re a real fucking smartass , you know that ?
we' re tossing every inch of this place .
every inch !
i didn' t do it , man .
i don' t know , man .
where is it ?
where is it ? !
oh , my god , this must be one of those new refrigerator safes !
what a laugh , you dumb fuck !
what' s all this , huh ?
what' s all this ? !
oh , bagels and guns .
what do you know ?
you' re going to prison .
you' re deep lock now .
now , tell us who sold you .
deep lock found , deep lock found .
come on , man , fuck all this shit , man !
unbelievably so fucking dumb !
are you kidding me ?
this is the last time i' m going to ask you !
who sold you ? !
get off me , man !
who sold you ?
darnell , man !
it was fucking darnell , man !
he' s got a cop id .
he' s got a shield .
you all right ?
let me see .
where you hit , the neck ?
let me call it in .
i' il call the paramedics .
hang in there .
i' il be right back .
what i have done is i' ve given him a rather large and strong dosage for the wound itself , but other than that , i' ve used a mild sedative for him .
what i am actually worried about is his prior history of drug abuse , and i' d like to know more about that series of ...
you know , i ... ... the problems that he had before .
i have to go and pick up my son .
we have a ... we have a son so ... but i' m i' m going to be back .
he didn' t do it .
i don' t know if you' re not listening or you don' t want to listen , but he didn' t do it !
well , we' ve compiled enough evidence to support the contrary .
wha ... ?
and what does that mean ?
what evidence ?
what ?
that means we' re closing it out .
captain ... there' s absolutely no way that sheps killed calvess .
and if you' re closing because of that , you' re way off .
neither one of us believe that he did it .
he didn' t have the balls to do this !
he didn' t have the capabilities !
he didn' t have the cold blood !
this guy did not do it .
and yet he had no compunction when faced with possible arrest about trying to kill both of you .
this is someone of questionable mental stability with a pronounced history of drug use .
that you can pin motive on .
that could ride the rap after the fact ,
' cause this is what you' re going to do in lieu of .
you know , you all are jazzed up because this piece of shit that we killed , sheps , was white .
so the whole racial card gets cooled , and you can forget about the dead cop .
that' s what this is all fuckin ' about .
all right , all right ,
henry , ease off , all right ?
wha ... ?
ease off .
we have a known criminal with over 40 felony and misdemeanor offenses with a drug tie linking him directly to calvess in possession of stolen weapons , narcotics and identification belonging to another slain officer .
richard dekolvie was stabbed to death three years ago ...
and homicide got a confession and a conviction out of that , so that bullshit' s irrelevant .
what you fuckin ' bringing that into it for ?
it still denotes illicit criminal acts .
oh , this is unfuckin ' believable .
sheps came into possession of the id as either a result of participation in the murder or through association with the murderers .
this guy was 105 pounds soaking wet .
if that .
these injuries that calvess sustained , they only could have come from two men with considerably more size and strength .
that' s not even taking into account ,
jesus christ , there' s no murder weapon .
what are you fuckin ' talking about here ?
this matter is no longer mine , gentlemen .
i apologize .
are you serious ?
are you serious ?
it' s the commissioner of police .
that is so fucked up .
yes , it is fucked up .
this is so fucked up .
we' re done .
you' re so wrong , pal .
fuckin ' bullshit !
i' m sorry , man .
i want you to stop now .
this is done .
it' s not .
no , it has to be .
you know i wasn' t happy and that was fine , but this is where i hit the wall
' cause i' ve seen you like this before .
and before i was willing to put myself through it , but i can' t do it anymore .
i' m gonna get ' em
i' m gonna get the guys who did it .
they fucking ... didn' t do it
' cause we ...
i , i lost ' em .
i lost ' em .
you know , you' re running at this for all the wrong reasons .
what , you think catching them is going to make you less like them ?
purified ?
just like calvess ?
you know what , that' s bullshit , nick ,
' cause that' s not what he was .
that' s not what you are .
i love you , but i don' t want ...
with everything that i am , i' m still going to leave .
' cause i can' t be with you like this .
i' m done trying .
i' m done trying .
tellis , you got something on your desk .
look at this .
where' d you get a warrant ?
friends where friends count .
i ran that name that deacon gave us ...
darnell .
this is what came back .
darnell , beery , " big d love .
possession , trafficking .
his last arrest was pulling a gun on an officer .
look who he was booked with .
eugene " deacon " sheps ...
latroy steeds .
steeds .
steeds and berry were never questioned about mike' s murder .
they all used to work at titan' s auto .
it was closed down after a flood six months ago .
i want to check this place out .
... chicks in my limousines , lovin ' every minute
of my fantasy , wet dreams , girl scream ...
hey .
fuck !
steeds or berry ?
freeze !
do not fuckin ' move !
do not move !
fuck !
fuck you .

fuck you !
now , fuckin ' coolio tried to blow my head off .
darnell , let me see you .
let me fuckin ' see you .

i don' t see no badges !
i don' t see no warrants !

let him go , man .
you shut the fuck up .
shut the fuck up .

i' il bet you all the prints that come up off of there
belongs to your man oak .
that' s right .
he planted it , man .
he put it there .
you got ten fucking seconds , front to back , for the record now .
go .
goddamn it !
open the door !
hey , god ...
tellis !
what the fuck was going on in there ?
why' d you just fucking lock me out ?
huh ?
i just asked you a question !
what' d you lock me out for ? !
were you tailing calvess the day he was killed ?
what ? !
you heard me !
did he compromise his cover ?
and were you tailing him as a result of that ?
you talked to them after i left ?
the mossberg off leflore .
dekolvie' s id and badge .
you heard them !
they' re claiming calvess supplied them with stolen police issued to make junk buys .
can you explain that ?
' cause i am having a hell of lot of trouble figuring that out !
exactly how long after i left did you let those liberal stirrings in you spill out all over the fucking floor ? !
the position i' m in ...
i don' t like where you' re putting me , and ask these questions .
now , were you following him ?
it' s not an indictment if you did , but if you did ,
i need to know , and i need to know that now .
no .
i was not tailing him .
but you were there before he died .
you were there before he died .
tell me that i' m wrong .
you wanna fucking talk ?
all right , we' il talk .
mike was making a bust that morning .
he had enough going against him to make an arrest .
he needed backup .
off roster .
why ?
because he wanted to bring ' em in on his own .
so i stayed back .
i waited , and the buy went bad .
then how come you couldn' t identify those guys in there right away ?
because they shot him and ran !
they shot him , but ... you shot them as they fled the scene .
what ?
what did they say to you ?
when that motherfucker oak starting shooting , he shot calvess , killed calvess .
he killed him , he killed calvess so that somebody could take the fall for his ...
you must be out of your fucking mind !
as much as he meant to me , you call on my integrity ? !
my commitment to that kid ? !
you' re going to let these fucking lowlife pieces of shit smear that ? !
huh ? !
it' s gotten past us .
we' re bringing ' em in .
we' re taking ' em in .
you' re fucking with something you can' t possibly understand .
i' m taking ' em in .
it' s over now .
you fucking joke .
you know that ?
you' re a fucking joke !
your whole career is a fucking joke !
a complete fucking washout !
you popped that needle freak in the park and in the process , you hit that fucking woman with a stray bullet , costing her a bouncing baby !
enough !
fucking her up for life !
enough !
stop !
shut the fuck up !
come on .
you' re a lie .
