cracking job , gromit .
hang on , old chum .
what' s going on ?
who is it ?
reel him in , lad .
to me .
to me .
gotcha !
thieving monster .
me prize pumpkin .
me little baby .
me pride and joy .
you' ve saved it , anti pesto .
it was nothing at all , mrs ...
everything' s under control .
oh , no !
don' t worry , madam .
thank you , mr. wallace .
all in a night' s work , mrs. mulch .
cute little feller , isn' t he ?
you' d never believe they' d cause so much damage .
oh , he may look innocent , sir .
but left to his own devices , this is the ultimate vegetable destroying machine .
reg , me teeth !
job well done , lad .
subject disarmed and neutralized .
bless you , anti pesto .
with you out there protecting our veg , the most important event of the year is safe .
aye .
and i hope they give them pests what' s coming to ' em , and all .
amen to that , mrs. mulch .
it was a long , hard night last night , gromit .
i' il need a good , hearty breakfast under me belt .
pile it up , lad .
i' m in the mood for food !
gromit , old pal .
it' s happened again .
i' il need assistance .
well , thanks , chuck .
i' m sure that hole' s getting smaller .
another successful night .
how are the inmates ?
must be getting a bit full down there .
talking of which .
now , for a great big plate of ... ... vegetables .
still got me on the diet , eh , gromit ?
watching me shape ?
there' s a good dog .
gromit , lad ?
how is that prize melon of yours coming on ?
must be a while since you measured it .
lovely food .
for rabbits , that is .
as for me , i need something a bit more cheesy .
caught red handed , eh , lad ?
i' m sorry , gromit .
i know you' re doing this for my own good , but the fact is i' m just crackers about cheese .
look , if i must change me ways , at least let me do it my way .
with technology .
it' s time we tried my latest invention , the mind manipulation omatic .
it extracts unwanted thoughts and desires .
i haven' t tested it yet , but it should be perfectly safe .
just a bit of harmless brain alteration , that' s all .
anti pesto humane pest control .
how might we be of assistance ?
yes .
lady tottington here of tottington hall .
your ladyship .
this is an honor .
it' s a disaster .
i have the most terrible rabbit problem .
the competition' s only days away .
you simply have to do something .
certainly , ma' am .
i think we' re about to go up in the world , lad .
just stay right where you are , your ladyship , and we' il be with you in an ...
in an hour ?
i can' t wait an hour .
i have a major infestation .
hello ?
hello ?
that' s more like it .
thank goodness you' ve ...
what ho !
for you , my love .
victor .
how lovely and ... unexpected .
heard you had a spot of rabbit bother and toodled on over to sort the blighters out .
gosh , that' s awfully sweet of you .
but you really needn' t bother .
it' s no bother , little boo boo .
it' s the least a chap can do for his filly .
don' t want pests spoiling our beautiful manor house , do we ?
our " manor house ?
no one' s mentioned marriage , victor .
all in good time , my dear .
vermin first , though , what what .
come on , phillip .
victor !
we can deal with this humanely .
very classy .
just the sort of client we should be dealing with , eh , lad ?
burrowing bounders !
they must be breeding like ... ... well , rabbits .
only one thing for it , lad .
victor , hadn' t we agreed ?
no more thoughtless killing .
quite right , my dear .
so i' ve thought this one through very carefully .
it' s off to bunny heaven for you , big ears .
victor !
no !
what the ... ?
champion sucker , eh , gromit ?
the bunvac 6000 .
this' il impress her ladyship .
i don' t understand .
it should have been a bull' s eye .
oh , victor .
i felt we' d made a real breakthrough with this hunting obsession of yours .
i really thought you' d changed .
i' m sorry , campanula , but i am what i am .
there' s no nonsense with victor quartermaine .
what you see is what you get .
what the ... ?
sounds like a really big brute , this one .
give it some more welly .
gosh !
maybe i should' ve used a bigger nozzle .
anti pesto , you' re here .
your ladyship .
my darlings !
you' re safe .
my word !
what a fabulous job you' ve done .
and not a single one harmed .
the old bv6000 , ma' am .
capable of 1 25 rpm .
that' s rabbits per minute .
how inspired !
mr ... ?
oh , wallace .
mr. wallace .
is this all of them ?
just one left .
hoist her up , gromit .
victor , stop fooling around in the dirt and have a look at this .
the ingenious anti pesto have completely dealt with my rabbit problem .
lsn' t it marvelous ?
marvelous ?
marvelous ?
this confounded contraption virtually suffocated me !
besides , the job' s only half done .
how do you intend to finish these vermin off ?
crush ' em ?
liquidize ' em ?
they' re humane .
humane ?
well , then perhaps they' d be humane enough to give me back my dignity .
i want ...
toupee , please .
oh , grand .
we take check or cash .
toupee , you idiot !
my hair is in your machine .
oh , no , it' s only rabbits in there .
the hare , i think you' il find , is a much larger mammal .
out of my way , fool .
i' m sorry , my dear , but i refuse to suffer any further humiliation at the hands of these blundering nitwits .
i therefore bid you good day .
thank you for ridding me of a real problem , mr. wallace .
tell me , what exactly will you do with all these rabbits ?
trade secret .
yes .
i' d be happy to let them roam free if it wasn' t for the competition .
but they do so love their veg .
it' s in their little bunny natures , and you can' t change that , can you ?
no .
or can you ?
why didn' t we think of it before , lad ?
the solution to all our storage problems .
simply by connecting the bunvac to the mind manipulation omatic , we can brainwash the bunnies .
rabbit rehabilitation .
once cured of their antisocial veg ravaging behavior , the rabbits can be safely released without fear of re offending .
just a little added lunar power to enhance the mind waves ...
... and we can begin .
veg , bad .
veg , bad .
veg , bad .
say no to carrots , cabbage and cauliflower .
well , come on , lad , what are you waiting for ?
turn on the bunvac .
full suction .
it' s working , gromit .
it' s working !
their tiny bunny brains are being saturated in my veg free mind waves .
another 30 minutes brainwashing should suffice .
then we can move on to the conditioning .
gromit !
switch it off !
get it off !
get it off me , lad !
oh , thanks , lad .
quick .
give us a carrot .
it worked , gromit !
a reformed rabbit .
we' il call him hutch .
shall we ?
come on .
let' s get the kettle on .
we' il see to him in the morning .
i feel we' re on the cusp of a real breakthrough , lad .
mankind freed from rabbit problems forever .
lady tottington will be impressed .
good night .
sleep tight .
and don' t let the bed bugs bite .
good night , gromit .
sweet dreams , old chum .
protect and nourish the frail and the weak , o lord .
protect and nourish the frail and the weak , o lord .
let them grow big and strong under thy loving care .
in fact , let them grow bigger and stronger than anyone else' s , so that the first prize might be mine .
amen .
the harvest offering to bind the deal .
we plow the fields and scatter the good seed on ...
he sends the snow in winter ...
all good gifts around us
are sent from ...
heavens above .
hello ?
hello ?
is anybody there ?
mrs. mulch ?
please , come forward , whoever you are .
there' s no need to be afraid .
you' re hungry .
then please , take what you like .
it is for the needy , after all .
no !
no !
no !
no !
mercy !
morning , gromit .
a pest free night per ... chance ?
lummy day .
it' s a disaster .
me garden' s ruined .
it' s a disaster .
me garden' s ruined .
it' s carnage out there .
where were anti pesto ?
simmer down .
simmer down , now .
right .
one at a time , if ya please .
we pay good money for our crop protection .
if ya can' t deliver the goods , maybe you should keep your traps shut .
i never saw such cauliflower carnage .
worse than the great slug blight of ' 32 , when there were slugs the size of pigs .
growbag' s right .
the slugs are back !
the slugs are back !
that' s enough !
that' s enough !
look , this flippin ' vegetable competition
causes nothin ' but trouble every year .
here we go .
if ya ask me ...
get on with ya !
know what ?
i' il tell ya .
if ya ask me , this was arson .
arson ?
aye !
someone arsin ' around .
that' s right .
one of you lot .
a man .
this was no man .
what are you saying ?
does a man have teeth the size of axe blades ?
or ears like terrible tombstones ?
by tampering with nature , forcing vegetables to swell far beyond their natural size , we have brought a terrible judgment upon ourselves .
hey !
give over !
you' re mental .
and for our sins , a hideous creature has been sent to punish us all !
repent !
repent !
lest you too , taste the wrath of ... ... the were rabbit !
this is terrible !
what' s going to happen to us ?
doomed !
who' s going to help us ?
what' s to become of the show ?
we live for that competition .
get off me .
we' re simple folk .
it' s all we have .
who will save us ?
get ...
hey !
a were rabbit ?
oh , come , come , now .
i do believe the vicar' s been to the communion wine again .
what we are dealing with here is no supernatural rabbit .
it' s a big fellow , perhaps .
but a mortal creature of flesh and blood .
a matter easily dealt with by a hunter .
guns will not be necessary , thank you , victor .
hasn' t there been enough destruction ?
i believe the killing of fluffy creatures is never justified .
i say we give anti pesto a second chance .
what ?
how on earth would those tiny minded buffoons ever catch such a big rabbit ?
mr. wallace ?
well ...
with a big trap .
by jove .
he' s ...
he' s got it !
genius !
genius !
brilliant .
what a great idea !
clever .
you see , victor , there' s hope for the vegetables yet .
not the ones i' m looking at .
that' s me boys !
love , gromit .
that' s the biggest trap of all .
the " tender trap , " they call it .
and that' s what we' il use to catch this thing .
yes , lad , a lovely lady rabbit .
how could any hot blooded rabbit beast resist ?
oh , come on , gromit .
a bit more , you know , alluring .
very cheeky .
that' s more like it , lad .
how can we possibly fail now ?
you' re a total knockout .
stick around , lad .
should fix back on quite easily .
nighty night , me lovelies .
think big now .
no !
don' t worry .
no .
no .
well , i' m very sorry , mrs. mulch .
we' il get there as soon as we can .
mr. dibber .
oh , yes .
can i call you back ?
mrs. girdling .
a tunnel you say ?
what do you intend to do about this ?
i' il look into it .
so where did you get to , lad ?
i thought i told you to stay put .
it' s gone mad around here .
i thought we were supposed to be a team .
how are we ever gonna catch this thing if you go gallivanting off on your own all the time ?
you' re doing it again !
where are you going now ?
gromit !
grommy !
really , lad .
you do realize i' ve made a personal promise to lady tottington .
how is this sort of behavior going to get us any nearer to finding a rabbit mon ... ster ?
hutch .
oh , gromit .
we' ve created a monster .
hutch is the beast .
the lunar panels .
they must' ve over stimulated hutch' s primitive bunny nature .
and now , when the moon appears , he undergoes a hideous transformation .
oh , gromit .
this is absolutely ... ... fantastic !
don' t you see , lad ?
ok , so we' ve created a veg ravaging rabbit monster .
but we' ve also captured it .
just like i promised lady tottington .
i' il go and tell her the good news .
make sure he doesn' t escape .
bye !
mr. wallace .
it' s the beast , your ladyship .
i bring great news .
gosh , how exciting .
please , do come in .
well , this is simply spiffing news .
with the beast in captivity , the competition can go ahead as planned .
you saved the day , mr. wallace .
it was nothing , your ladyship .
so modest .
oh , please , do help yourself .
thanks .
i so appreciate you coming all this way to let me know , wallace .
tell me , are you a vegetable lover yourself ?
they' re ... growing on me .
then come with me .
there' s something very special i want to show you .
hop in .
it' s very snug .
it' s my jacob' s ladder .
and it goes all the way to heaven .
welcome to my inner sanctum , wallace .
my secret garden .
it' s a veritable vegetable paradise .
i just knew you' d love it .
unlike victor .
he' s never shown any interest in my produce .
his loss , lady tottington .
please , wallace .
call me totty .
if anything were to happen to my vegetables ,
i don' t know what i' d do .
i' m sure you understand , mr. wallace .
i can see that you' re a true nature lover .
oh , yes .
yes , i am .
at first , i thought i could change victor .
now i' m not so sure .
do you think a man can change , wallace ?
change ?
oh , yes .
really , phillip .
the things one does for love .
pesto .
mr. wallace .
oh , totty .
totty ?
i' d like to show you one last thing .
something no other man has ever seen .
my carrot de chantenay .
just smell it , wallace .
feel its silken flesh .
oh , yes .
isn' t it the most sumptuous , succulent specimen you' ve ever seen ?
yes !
doesn' t it fill your heart
with desire ?
yes !
just imagine what it would taste like .
what on earth were you thinkin ' of , lad ?
ruined a perfectly good piece of fashionable knitwear , that did .
to say nothing of a relationship with an important client .
it' s lucky for us her ladyship was so understanding .
honestly , i don' t know what' s got into you lately .
and slow down for pity' s sake .
you' il buckle me trunnions .
don' t worry .
i' il see to this .
you stay here where you belong .
in the doghouse .
right .
it' s heavier than it looks .
i know your little secret , pesto .
i know exactly what' s going on .
your lordship ...
yes .
you think you can pilfer my filly , don' t you ?
you think you can con a woman out of her fortune ?
who , me ?
well , i got here first !
i' ve spent a long time reeling in that fluffy headed bunny lover .
and i' m not about to let some puddle headed peasant poach her from me .
comprenez ?
right o .
i' il be off then .
ta ta .
you' re not going anywhere , pesto .
not until i' ve taught you a jolly good lesson .
come on !
queensberry rules !
put ' em up , ya little pipsqueak .
you' re shaking .
don' t tell me you' re a scaredy cat as well as a scoundrel .
and don' t think acting like a big girl' s blouse will get you out of it .
there' s no mercy with victor quartermaine .
what the dickens ?
what on earth ... ?
phillip !
attack !
attack !
what the ... ?
vicar !
vicar !
oh , where the devil is he ?
do you want to confess ?
i want to talk to you about ... ... the beast .
everything you need to know is in this book .
" nun wrestling .
no .
i meant this one .
here .
here it is .
the hideous monster plaguing our parish .
the were rabbit .
so it' s true .
the beast lurks within all of us , my child .
the side that emerges at night as the moon rises into the sky .
the side that savagely rips the leaves off any innocent cabbage .
spare me the sermon , vicar .
just tell me how i kill him .
i mean " it .
to kill such a creature would require nerves of steel and ... ... a bullet .
a bullet ?
a bullet .
a bull ...
what kind of bullet ?
a bullet of pure gold .
gold .
yes .
twenty four karat .
get out of my way .
silly old fool .
beware !
beware of the beast within !
perfect re entry , gromit .
this veg diet' s doing the trick , eh , lad ?
i feel smashing .
so how' s our rabbit monster ?
hope you' re keeping an eye on him .
what' s up , dog ?
well , fancy that .
rabbit ears .
that is a bit odd .
and what are you tryin ' to say , lad ?
what ?
what ?
what ?
you think that i' m the ... ?
because of these ?
oh , no .
no .
this is just a reaction to that healthy veg diet you' ve got me on .
it' s the toxins coming out .
silly old pooch .
thinking i' m the beast .
next thing you' il be saying is that hutch is turning into me .
hey .
what are you doing , lad ?
have you gone completely mad ?
cheese !
cheese ?
i do like a bit of gorgonzola .
oh , dear .
perfect .
ma' am .
now , let' s see .
coming through !
the tombola' s arrived .
and the bouncy tottington hall .
splendid .
it' s going to be such a jolly competition tonight .
i just know it .
ya don' t know nothin ' .
what ?
the beast has struck again .
that' s what .
that' s right !
no , you' re quite mistaken , mrs. mulch .
the beast is in captivity .
oh , yeah ?
then just take a look at my wife' s brassicas .
ravaged in the night .
but i don' t understand .
anti pesto told me ...
a pack of lies !
it' s not safe to bring our vegetables here .
the show' s off .
but this is simply dreadful news .
the tottingtons have held a giant vegetable competition on this very night for over 500 years .
that' s right .
not even the great duck plague of ' 53 stopped it .
if only there were another way .
what ho !
it' s quartermaine .
heard you had a spot of rabbit bother .
didn' t this bit used to ... ?
now .
now , let' s see .
where does this part go ?
oh , it' s hopeless .
i' il never fix this flippin ' machine .
me mind' s just a rabbit y mush .
oh , gromit .
i don' t wanna be a giant rabbit !
the bounce is gone from his bungee .
hey , presto !
rabbit rehabilitation .
but if i can' t fix it ...
cheddar . ... maybe the other me can !
i' m inventing , mostly .
look at me go !
i' m a genius .
awake !
i can' t answer the door .
not like this .
charming .
i' m wallace .
i already am !
hutch !
geronimo !
wallace ?
hang on a mo ' .
wallace ?
hello ?
i say .
open this door at once .
totty .
lady tottington , if you don' t mind .
i' m afraid i have some rather bad news , wallace .
thing is , well , you' ve rather let me down with this beastly beast business .
i suppose i have .
yes .
it' s obvious to me that you have absolutely no idea where this poor creature is .
and i' m afraid you' ve given me no option but to let victor shoot the poor thing .
shoot it ?
yes .
wasn' t an easy choice , but the veg competition has to come first .
besides , victor' s promised me it won' t suffer .
it will be quick and painless .
how thoughtful .
i cannot deny it was a difficult decision for me .
because i' ve recently developed ...
hurry ! ... feelings for you .
feelings ?
oh , well , never mind , eh ?
ta ra , then .
wait !
wallace .
i haven' t finished .
there' s more that needs to be said .
well , i' il give you a tinkle , shall l ?
can' t we at least shake hands ?
part as friends ?
it' s not very convenient at the moment .
thanks for coming by .
well , i ...
i ...
that' s right , my lovely .
you can say goodbye to your fluffy lover boy .
you gotta help me , gromit !
hide me .
anything .
before it' s too late !
lad !
your lordship .
good night , gromit .
' tis done .
my poor sensitive child .
allow us all to share in your moment of sorrow .
yeah !
on with the show !
what the ... ?
why you ...
of course .
the vegetable competition .
your loyalty is moving .
sadly , you won' t be .
come along , phillip .
everyone' s been looking forward to a good show .
let' s see they get one .
hooray !
mr. growbag .
i ...
i have a hunch this' il be a night to remember .
i just have a hunch .
all right .
all right .
if we must do this flipping veg show ,
iet' s do it in an orderly and law abiding fashion .
cucumbers , give way to melons .
carrots , wait your turn !
aubergines ...
there' s our bait , phillip .
all we have to do now is wait for our fluffy friend to appear .
look over here , everyone !
it' s victor !
he' s here !
our hero .
please , sir , kiss my baby .
another time , perhaps .
kiss my potato .
not now .
kiss my artichoke .
look , just ...
victor .
campanula !
victor , i have to know .
did it suffer ?
of course not , my dear .
not yet , anyway .
victor ?
oy , you .
constable .
careful with them capsicums .
listen , i don' t want to cause panic , but the beast isn' t actually dead yet .
the beast isn' t actually dead yet ?
what ?
oops .
to the competition stand !
cracking toast , gromit .
i' m just crackers about cheese .
monterey jack .
smashing wensleydale .
job well done , lad .
quiet !
quiet !
now , listen carefully .
i' ve only got two ...
i' ve only got one gold bullet left .
so leave this to me .
yes , all right , i admit the beast is still at large .
but the good news is your prize vegetables are the perfect bait ...
bait ? ... and will draw the creature like a magnet .
keep still .
my baby .
there , there , love .
it' il be all ...
don' t even move a muscle .
mrs. mulch !
no !
it' s not getting my baby !
lovely food .
for rabbits , that is .
come back !
come back !
yes .
right on cue .
come back !
go away !
that' s right .
come to uncle victor .
it' s coming for us !
bingo .
what the ... ?
hurrah for anti pesto !
it' s getting away !
get off , you stupid ...
no !
vicar , i need more gold bullets .
they don' t come cheap , you know .
victor ?
what are you doing ?
i need it , my sweet .
emergency .
victor , no !
please !
come , now , campanula , let go .
but it' s my golden carrot award .
this is hardly the time , my darling .
give it to me this instant !
but victor !
cheese , gromit .
the golden carrot belongs in the show !
no , the golden carrot belongs in the were rabbit .
every man for himself !
help !
help !
help me !
put me down at once , you great big hairy thing , you !
stop !
stop !
mob supplies !
get your angry mob supplies here .
put her down , you great ugly brute !
i' il bagsy the lucky rabbit' s foot .
help me , someone !
help me !
yes .
no .
no , no , no !
put me down !
put me down , you ...
whatever you are !
help !
what is it ?
what are you staring at with those beastly eyes ?
wallace .
oh , wallace .
what ever have you done to yourself ?
well , don' t you worry .
i' il protect you .
get your hairy mitts off my future wife , you big brute .
no !
victor !
you don' t understand .
the hunt is off .
it' s ...
we made a terrible mistake .
no .
you commissioned me to rid you of pesto , and that' s just what i intend to do .
pesto ?
why , you knew it was wallace all along .
oh , all right .
so what if it is that blithering idiot .
no one will ever believe you .
and if i can' t have your money , i can still bag your bunny .
my eyes !
run , rabbit , run !
i rather like your hair pinned back .
no , victor , no !
stop !
please !
victor !
you can hop , but you can' t hide , pesto .
beware the moon !
stupid interfering mutt .
stand back !
there may be a large rabbit dropping !
looks like the buck stops here .
eat karat , bunny boy !
potty poo !
no one beats victor quartermaine !
is that so ?
consider yourself dumped .
he' s in there !
there he is !
surround him !
there he is !
over there !
phillip , help me !
phillip !
do something .
destroy !
drive out the monstrosity !
well , let' s see how he likes it .
wallace ?
oh , gromit .
well , at least now he' s at peace .
the rabbit' s gone .
if only there were a way to bring back wallace .
lovely cheese , gromit .
gromit ?
don' t forget the crackers .
cheese ?
cheese !
it' s me again .
i' m back !
gromit !
you clever mutt .
well done , old pal !
totty !
wallace !
you' re ...
thanks , lad .
oh , look !
well , i think you deserve this , gromit .
for a brave and splendid melon .
we' ve all got a lot to thank you for .
every dog has his day .
and thank you , wallace .
you' ve saved me from a terrible marriage .
all the same , it is going to be rather lonely at tottington hall now .
unless ...
i have a little proposal for you , wallace .
i' m so thrilled you agreed to go through with this .
my pleasure , totty .
one for the album , gromit .
i declare this bunny sanctuary officially open .
when you' re ready , lad .
fire up the old bv6000 .
oh , it' s simply marvelous .
my home , a safe haven for all things fluffy .
i do hope you' il still come visit , wallace .
i' d rather got used to having you around .
there' il always be a part of me here at tottington hall .
give it some more welly , lad .
cheese !
