in the old days , the land felt a great emptiness .
it was waiting ... waiting to be filled up ... waiting for someone to love it ... waiting for a leader .
and he came on the back of a whale ... a man to lead a new people .
our ancestor , paikea .
but now we were waiting for the firstborn of the new generation ... for the descendant of the whale rider ...
for the boy who would be chief .
paikea .
paikea .
there was no gladness when i was born .
my twin brother died and took our mother with him .
rawiri .
everyone was waiting for the firstborn boy to lead us ... but he died ... and i didn' t .
where is the boy ?
son .
what' s done is done .
come home .
come home .
start again .
you mean just pretend it didn' t happen .
that' s not what i' m saying .
you didn' t even look at her , dad !
she died .
son ...

he' il be back when he' s ready .
stupid old paka .

he start that early with me ?
you' re a man .
you can handle it .
here .
better get used to it .
this one' s gonna need someone to look out for her .
yeah .

my koro wished in his heart that i' d never been born ...
but he changed his mind .
hey !
you old paka !
quick !
they were quick .
must have let them off early or something .
you' ve been smoking .

maori women have got to stop smoking .
we' ve got to protect our childbearing properties .

my dad' s coming .
nay ?
better get my flash dress out then .
how long' s he staying this time ?
five minutes ?
longer than that .
that' s good , ' cause i blinked and missed him last time .
what time' s the concert , bub ?
7 : 30 , and don' t be late .
gee , she' s bossy , that one .
and you' d have to be smoking in a pretty funny place to wreck your childbearing properties .
if you ask me the name of this house , i will tell you .
it is whitireia .
and the carved figurehead at the top ?
it is paikea .
it is paikea .

he went away .

thanks , ma .
thanks , ma .
your timing' s spooky , boy .
nerd !
putt putt putt !
ah !
what was that for ?
for the concert last night .
you have more respect next time .
that teacher of yours got herself a husband yet ?
don' t think so .
she still got those things on her teeth ?
paka , at school we gotta do a speech on where we come from and that .
so anyway , you know how we all came on a whale ?
that' s right .
but where does the whale come from ?
from hawaiiki .
where' s that ?
it' s where we lived before we came here , where the ancestors are .
so , paikea came from there .
ae .
how long ago ?
long time .
but how long ?
see that there ?
look at it closely .
what do you see ?
lots of little bits of rope all twisted together .
that' s right .
weave together the threads of paikea so that our line remains strong .
each one of those threads is one of your ancestors ... all joined together and strong ... all the way back to that whale of yours .
useless bloody rope .
i' il get another one .
paka !
paka !
it' s working !
it' s working .
i don' t want you to do that again .
it' s dangerous .
that' s a good one .
come in .
a seat for you over there .
kia ora .
hi .
hi .
kia ora .
have you met pai' s father ?
porourangi ... this is miss parata from the school .
kia ora .
kia ora .
thought she' d appreciate seeing the show .
no problem .
this is some of my work from my last exhibition in germany .
start again , from the beginning .
she wants to see all of it .
all right .
yeah , like i was saying , uh ... oh , sorry .
who' s that , bro ?
anna .
it' s a woman i' ve been seeing .
actually , she' s pregnant .
we' re expecting a child .
why didn' t you tell me ?
congratulations , bro .
you always get the good looking ones .
where is she ?
why don' t you bring her ?
uh , she lives in germany , mum .
you know .
she wanted to have the child at home .
but you' il bring her back here .
yeah , of course .
well , um , bit of a visit when baby gets big .
rawiri , take miss parata back to town .
come with me , pai .
when were you gonna tell me ?
the day you left ?
i' ve been trying to tell you since i got here .
look , dad .
it' s not forever .
it' s just it' s anna' s first child , you know ?
her work' s there , her family .
family ?
yeah , i can' t expect her to move to the other side of the world .
don' t you use that girl as an excuse .
you can' t wait to get away .
i see it in you .
you never stay , because it hurts you to see what' s happening to us .
yeah , it does .
you still walk away from it .
leave that waka of yours out there to rot .
i' m not here shoveling shit , but , dad , i' m doing my share .
did you even see my work ?
did you ... did you even look at it ?
you call it work .
it' s not work .
it' s souvenirs .
those young men you turn your back on ... they' ve got something to learn from you .
you' ve got something to offer .
don' t you turn away !
yeah , you' ve got the privileges ... but you forget you' ve also got the obligations !
look at me , dad , for once in your life .
go on .
ah , you don' t even know who i am .
i know who you' re meant to be , who you were born to be .
oh , yeah , right .
but i failed ya , eh , dad ?
yeah , because why ?
i had a daughter ?
well , i' m probably gonna have another daughter .
and you know what ?
i' m not gonna let you treat another child of mine like that .
then take her with you !
you don' t like the job i' m doing , take her !
go on !
take her !
stop it !
she' s no use to me .
pai ?
no , leave her .
i' il get her .
pai !
you all right ?
gotta watch that koro sometimes .
big mouth of his gets away on him , eh ?
he didn' t mean it ... about me .
well ... you know , maybe we should think about it .
think about what ?
you coming to live with me for a while .
what do ya think ?
why doesn' t he want me ?
oh , pai , it' s not you .
it' s not even about you , in a way .
koro is just ... he' s just looking for something that doesn' t exist anymore .
a new leader ?
they exist .
yeah , they do , except i think ... it' s become even more than that .
in his head , your koro , he needs a prophet .
what' s that ?
well , somebody who' s gonna lead our people outta the darkness ... and who' il make everything all right again .
only problem is , you can' t just decide who those people are just because you want them to be , eh ?
like my brother ?
yeah .
your koro made himself believe so strongly that he was gonna be the one .
but what if he was ?
and what if he wasn' t ?
you know , your koro , he did the same thing with me .
is that why he' s so hard on you ?
yep .
pretty much .
because i can' t be what he wants , eh ?
me neither .
you think about it , okay ?
you know you' d make me really happy if you' d come and stay with me .
mmm .
just think about it .
ready , pai ?
one more go .
you be good to that girl .
that' s right .
you look .
i' m gonna need all the firstborn boys .
it' s time they learnt .
learnt what ?
when she was born , that' s when things went wrong for us .
that' s where we' il find the answer .
you all right ?
stop the car .
pai ?
what is it , pai ?
can we go home now ?
but why ?
what is it ?
what' s wrong ?
i have to go home .
why ?
i just have to .
i know .
it' s okay .
there are some discussions about the ...
paka !
i' m back .
not now , pai .
but i' m back .
i' m back .
anyway ... where does that information come from ?
it comes from the books .
you shouldn' t be smoking .
tryin ' to give up , aren' t i ?
how come you didn' t go with your dad ?
i did .
hmm .
for one day .
i would have gone .
when my dad gets out , i' m gonna go with him .
where ?
wherever .
get outta this dump .
koro' s gonna be pissed off when he sees you smoking .
no , he won' t , ' cause he' s not coming .
is so .
no , he' s getting the school ready .
what school ?
for us fellas , to teach us the old ways and that .
probably gonna be stink .
you can come on the bus if you want .
i' m waiting for koro .
but he' s not coming .
i said , " i' m waiting .
when you' re ready .
when everyone' s here , i' il be ready .
they are here .
those boys have waited half an hour .
you tell her you weren' t going to pick her up ?
she could have come on the bus .
you pick her up every day for years and she' s just supposed to guess ?
good .
let' s go .
do the welcome , bub .
go on .
what do you think you' re doing ?
pai .
you' re a girl .
go to the back .
what did i say ?
what did i say ?
then leave .
go on !
for you boys , this will be a sacred school of learning .
you' il be taught in the old ways ... in all the qualities of a chief .
you will be tested for your strength ... your courage , your intelligence ... and your leadership .
paikea' s canoe sank ... and he called on the ancient ones for strength .
you' re going to learn that chant .
all of you .
learn it exactly .
and if you break the chant , you will suffer the utu ...
the consequences .
like what ?
someone dying or something ?
like your dick' il drop off .
so , hold onto your dicks .
enough .
hold onto your dick .
now , repeat after me .
the taiaha is an instrument of war ... a tool for fighting .
if you want to master it , you' ve got to show it respect .
hemi .
here .
peh !
pick it up .
good .
be angry .
anger' s part of your battle .
you gotta learn to control it .
now , take a break .
get a drink of water .
the rest of you in pairs .
koro know you' re doing that ?
i' m not doing anything .
how come you' re hiding around here then ?
koro' s cool , eh ?
he' s teaching us to be warriors , man .
gonna be chiefs .
we' re gonna smack all those other ones .
you shouldn' t have hit koro like that .
he was all right .
he was real patient , eh ?
how come he won' t let you do it ?
girls aren' t allowed .
you could sit up the back .
long as you were quiet .
i wouldn' t mind .
you' re not even holding it right .
your hands should be like this .
and your feet ...
like this .
go back to the school , hemi .
i said , " go .
i' il deal with you later .
i' m sorry , paka .
you gone deaf now ?
somebody just apologized to you .
you don' t mess around with sacred things !
she was just watching !
she was using a taiaha .
let the girl do it .
you might be the boss out there ... but i' m the boss in this kitchen .
i' il do it .
you forgot something .
hey , it' s not too bad up here .
he' s got a lot of rules he has to live by .
it' s not fair .
i know ... but sometimes you' ve just got to let him think that he' s the boss .
he is the boss .
hmph .
not of me .
i let him think he is , though .
what' s wrong with me , nanny ?
nothing' s wrong with you .
you hear me ?
you got the blood of muriwai in your veins , girl .
think she' d be proud of you saying things like that ?
anyway , that old paka' s not the only one who knows some tricks .
eh ?
well , you wouldn' t know it now , but before he got fat and ugly ... your uncle rawiri was a bit of a hotshot with the taiaha .
true ?
won a trophy and everything .
oh , you should have seen him .
he was beautiful .
what happened ?
i don' t know .
he was the second son .
but he knows some things , your uncle rawiri .
don' t you worry about that .
is uncle here ?
out the back .
hi .
damn , girl .
what did i tell you about sneaking up on us ?
i found this .
didn' t know you played golf .
not golf .
taiaha .
yeah , well , this guy' s playing golf .
they cut the end off the golf stick ... swing it around , and push it through there .
hey , shut up !
i was good .
that' s why you' re sitting here ... while your father tells a bunch of snotty nosed kids how to be chief .
poor little bastards , huh ?
could you teach me ?
hold up .
this was a long time ago .
so ?
please ?
does koro know about this ?
no .
well , let' s get it on then , eh ?
yes !
you mean this ?
it' s a broom , isn' t it ?
yee hee !

hey !
there goes that little girl , pai !
move , girl !
move !
get him , pai !
go , pai !

when you extend your tongue ... you' re saying to your enemies ...
i' m gonna eat you .
your eyes will roll back .
your head will be stuck on the end of my stick .
feel the ihi ... the power .
make them feel the wehi , the fear .
i want the hairs on the backs of their necks to stand up .
take off your shirts .
when you slap your chests ... i want you to slap them hard .
bleh !
bleh !
scratch them .
make them bleed .
timata .
bleh !

hey .
hey .

next couple of days , maybe .
we' re outta here .
get lost , you .
was that your dad ?
get lost .
what have you done ?
answer me .
it wasn' t her fault .
go wash your face .
answer me , pai .
do you know what you' ve done ?
no .
you have broken the tapu of this school ... on this marae , the one place where our old ways are upheld .
the knowledge that' s been passed down from your ancestors ... from my grandfather to me , to those boys ...
it' s broken !
i' m sorry , paka .
you' re not sorry .
right from the beginning , you knew this wasn' t for you ... but you keep coming back .
do you want me to fail ?
no .
you want these boys to fail ?
what have you got to say to them ?
i' m sorry .
say it again .
i' m sorry .
say it till you mean it !
say it !
i' m sorry .
want me to put some more hot in ?
no .
no .
you can get sick sitting in a cold bath .
what if he fails , nanny ?
then he fails .
what will happen to him ?
nothing will happen ... except me thinking about that divorce .
it' s not koro' s fault , nanny .
what' s not his fault ?
sounds like his fault to me .
not that i' m a girl .
not you , hemi .
rawiri .
you' ve all done very well .
you' ve shown me that you' ve got courage , that you' re strong ... and that you can learn .
but there can only be one ... so there' s one final test ... a test of your spirit .
if you have the tooth of a whale ... you must have the whale' s jaw to wield it .
one of you will bring that back to me .
bubba' s got a cold , and i can' t swim .
it' s all right , man .
hey .
give it to me .
i almost had it .
nanny ?
come here .
it' s not for long .
you can put your clothes in there .
and , uh , there' s a lamp if you wanna read .
rawiri reckons you' re pretty brainy , eh ?
anyway , it' s just for a little while .
he was calling to the ancient ones , asking them to help him ... but they weren' t listening .
so i tried ...
and they heard me .
uncle , is this where paka lost his reiputa ?
his what ?
that thing he wore around his neck .
he threw it overboard .
crazy old paka .
where ?
just over there .
i' il get it .
it' s quiet down deep .
koro needed quiet .
that' s what nanny said .
he didn' t want to talk anymore .
he just wanted to go down and down .
she' s been gone quite a while , eh ?
nah , she' s sweet .
for paka' s tea .
and i found this .
got this for dad' s tea .
lovely .
pop it in the sink .
pai got it .
she got this as well .
you gonna tell him ?
no .
he' s not ready yet .
go on .
it' s for my school concert .
you' re my guest of honor .
so i' il see you there , paka .
put mine there .
come on .
i want to get up in the front .
save this one for paka .
he might be held up , bub .
no , he' s coming .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
now to finish , we have something very special .
one of our students has won , not only our own school speech contest ... but the east coast area schools ' , as well .
ladies and gentlemen , please welcome miss paikea apirana .
did you know about this ?
she said she had a surprise ... for him .
this speech is a token of my deep love and respect ... for koro apirana , my grandfather .
my name is paikea apirana ...
go on , bub .
and i come from a long line of chiefs , stretching all the way back to hawaiiki ... where our ancient ones are ... the ones that first heard the land crying and sent a man .
his name was also paikea ... and i am his mo ... most recent descendant .
but i was not the leader my grandfather was expecting ... and by being born ... i broke the line back to the ancient ones .
it wasn' t anybody' s fault .
it just happened .
who is to blame ?
but we can learn .
and if the knowledge is given to everyone , we can have lots of leaders .
and soon , everyone will be strong ... notjust the ones that' ve been chosen .
because sometimes , even if you' re the leader and you need to be strong ... you can get tired .
like our ancestor , paikea , when he was lost at sea ... and he couldn' t find the land , and he probably wanted to die .
but he knew the ancient ones were there for him ... so he called out to them to lift him up and give him strength .
this is his chant .
i dedicate it to my grandfather .
she all right ?
she' s asleep .
that old man know she' s staying the night ?
if he doesn' t like it , he can sleep in the road .
might be time for us to leave , eh , dear ?
what is it ?
you' d better come have a look .
who is to blame ?
i called them and they came ... but it wasn' t right .
they were dying .
hey , keep it away from the blowhole , bro .
that' s it .
just around the edges .
you okay ?
he died .
koro knew what it meant .
it was paikea' s whale , sent to us because we were in trouble .
dad ?
we' ve got to turn it around .
how ?
get a tractor down here and some ropes .
we' il wait for the tide .
if ... if we can move it , the others will follow .
get the men .
they' re stuffed .
half of them have been up all night .
they' il do it for you .
it was a test ... but for koro this time .
leave it .
you' ve done enough .
now !
e pana e !
e pana e !
he wanted to die .
there wasn' t a reason to live anymore .
it' s no use .
they' re too tired .
we' il try again later .
let them rest .
come on , dear .
we' il come back .
come on .
it' s gone !
where is she ?
where' s my moko ?
where is she ?
pai !
it' s okay , paka .
i wasn' t scared to die .
hurry up !
hurry !
let' s go !
which one ?
what do you mean , which one ?
yes ?
thank you , dear .
i' ve been praying to god about it .
if that little one wakes up , i' m gonna give up the smokes .
she' d like that .
wise leader , forgive me .
i am just a fledgling new to flight .
my name is paikea apirana , and i come from a long line of chiefs ... stretching all the way back to the whale rider .
i' m not a prophet ... but i know that our people will keep going forward ... all together , with all of our strength .
