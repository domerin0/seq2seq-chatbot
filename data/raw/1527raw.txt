here you go .
sure you don' t want me to wait ?
no , thanks .
i' il walk back .
georgie .
how could i have forgotten ?
i' m so sorry .
take your pick ... ... billy boy .
except for the one on the end .
that' s already taken .
sorry .
i remember you .
i remember we beat you .
i' m not afraid of you .
i' m not afraid of you .
i know how old i look .
it' s just i remember you as a kid .
welcome home , bill .
i only wish it was under happier ... .
come on , let' s go out .
i didn' t need to create any more paranoia in there .
i got a taste of it earlier .
at least people seem to care .
maybe it' s that i' m a grownup now .
i feel so thick .
i don' t remember much of it at all , or why i came back .
except for georgie .
better it doesn' t all come back at once .
how come you remember it ?
i never left .
i look on a corner and there we were .
lucky seven .
oh , man , that just came back .
something else .
one of us lived around here .
right .
bev !
right down the street .
she was poor .
her father was the janitor .
this was poortown .
yeah , still is .
yours ?
hey , i' m a bachelor , bill .
it' s all i need .
it' s clean and better yet , it' s paid for .
getting hungry ?
i haven' t been since you called .
i' ve arranged dinner for all of us .
have you seen any of the others ?
nope .
i had a feeling all afternoon .
i could tell when we each hit town .
we aren' t all here yet .
no .
you too ?
whatever it is , it' s powerful .
here' s to remembering .
what ?
this might stimulate those memory banks .
silver .
i ran across it in the pawn shop .
something made me buy it .
it' s got a flat tire , but that' s all that' s wrong .
here' s the real kicker .
i bought this tube repair kit on impulse ... ... about three months before i saw this bike .
there was some force guiding us that summer .
it either came to help us or we created it .
but maybe ... ... maybe it' s still here .
i' m gonna change clothes .
not the paramount , you slime balls !
where are people supposed to get their culture ?
may i help you ?
mike hanlon .
he stepped out .
i' m sure he' s coming back .
good .
i' m gonna sit here and i' m gonna wait here for him .
come on , tozier .
get a grip .
you looked like you could use this water .
thank you .
a little young for you , isn' t she , richie ?
beep , beep , richie .
i didn' t hear that .
i didn' t !
i beg your pardon ?
come on up , richie .
i got a balloon for you .
don' t you want a balloon ?
what' s the matter ?
one balloon not enough ?
try a bunch !
is everything all right ?
last chance , tozier .
get out before it gets dark tonight .
you' re too old to stop me .
you' re all too old !
tell mike , if you see him ...
excuse me , sir .
do you have prince albert in a can ?
you do ?
well , you better let the poor guy out .
tell mike hanlon , say i had to go ... ... i had to get cleaned up .
tell him .

tell him i' il see him tonight .
get out !
last chance .
get out !
get out while you can .
excuse me , ma' am .
is your refrigerator running ?
it is ?
well , you better catch it before it runs away .
all right !
toro !
toro !
son of a gun .
not just any cards .
bicycle .
they always made the best noise .
bill .
i see it .

what' s that ?
you' re breaking up , fran .
i' il call you from the hotel .

tubby !

you' re gonna make it .
ben !
ben hanscom !
nice to see you again .
what have you been up to all these years ?
we can' t wait to get you down here with us .
you' re in my mind .
only in my mind .
any spare change , mister ?
hey , who walked all over your grave ?
i wasn' t gonna hurt you .
i don' t even know you .
let' s go .
derry inn , did you say ?
yeah .
reliving your childhood ?
something like that .
just saying hi to some old ghosts , you know .
oh , hell .
time does go by .
here' s that prescription .
how old are you now , son ?
eleven .
almost 12 .
old enough .
come with me .
come on .
relax , eddie .
i' m not gonna bite you .
your troubles come from always being tight and stiff .
you take your asthma , for instance .
you know what a placebo is , eddie ?
i gotta go .
it' s water , with a squirt of camphor .
no .
your mother is determined that you' re ill .
you' re caught in the middle .
it' s all a lie , a great big lie !
i do have asthma .
i do !
sir ?
your prescription .
nothing like a good pull on the old lung sucker , huh ?
thank you .
junior , bring me a cigar .
you know you can' t have one , granddad .
mr. keene ?
mr. keene .
hello .
cigar for the old man ?
i' m sorry , i don' t have any .
i' m eddie kaspbrak .
sonia kaspbrak' s son ?
how about some licorice ?
i was always partial to licorice .
i just wanted to thank you for trying to tell me the truth a long time ago .
you look a little peaked , sonny .
i better go .
hydrous .
what ?
h2o .
water .
it' s only water .
it' s all in your head , sonny .
you do remember me .
oh , mr. keene ... !
mr. keene ?
get out of derry while you still can .
mr. keene , please .
beware , little eddie .
beware !
girly boy !
no cigar , sonny .
i was always partial to licorice .
i' m sorry .
i was looking for marsh .
marsh ?
yes .
there' s no marsh here .
unless ... .
you don' t mean alvin marsh ?
yes , my father .
i hate to be the one to have to tell you this , a stranger ... ... but your father' s been dead the last five years .
but the bell ...
kersh . " i thought it said marsh .
i' m mrs. kersh .
i knew your father a little .
come in .
let me give you tea .
i couldn' t .
you could and you will .
i insist .
feel free to look around .
perhaps you' d like to freshen up ?
did you fall asleep in there ?
it' s teatime .
tea .
tea would be nice .
i love what you' ve done with the place .
it' s different .
so cozy .
how kind you are , miss .
i call all the pretty young girls miss .
don' t take offense .
no .
well , go on , dear .
drink it while it' s nice and hot .
well , don' t trouble your pretty little head , dear .
i' il get it .
it did say marsh on the doorbell .
lf you' re wise , you' il run , dear .
because to stay will mean worse than your death .
they float down there .
they float .
i worry about you , bevvie .
i worry a lot .
it won' t do you any good to run , bevvie .
you' re not real .
you' re not real !
i told you the first time you introduced me to him , he was a twit .
i didn' t ask you over to insult bill .
how dare he do this !
you' ve been complaining since we started this .
he' il never work in movies again .
if you could have seen his face .
it was frightening .
nothing like a crisis to bring the estranged couple together .
or pull them apart ... ... if the gods are smiling .
please .
i am simply pointing out that this could be a blessing in disguise .
would you consider giving me a few days ?
i shall pretend i didn' t hear that , audra .
i can replace your imbecilic husband .
i cannot replace you .
don' t even think about leaving , audra .
you' ve worked hard to get where you are .
i know you' d do nothing to imperil that or damage our business relationship .
or to turn a friend into an enemy , ready to crucify you at any cost .
but there' s no need to talk about that now .
see you tomorrow .
international reservations , please .
yes , i' d like a seat on your next flight to the united states .
excuse me .
i' m looking for the hanlon party .
eddie ?
ben ?
eddie kaspbrak ?
haystack ?
what happened to the rest of you ?
gone but not forgotten .
hey , buddy !
oh , my god .
where' s tozier when you need a good line ?
ben ?
i' m afraid so .
i can' t believe it .
look at you .
hey , bill .
hey .
michael , oh , god .
mike , is that you ?
such as i am .
listen .
who wants a drink ?
i' il have one .
what' s this ?
that' s my dog .
i' il have club soda , okay ?
this is good .
don' t let them see you like this .
that was a hallucination .
it was too much fun in ' 67 .
just get ahold .
you work too hard .
you guys .
i' il have one .
i propose a toast ...
who got bald , and how many of god' s children got wings ?
beep , beep , richie !
richie , beep , beep .
mike , hey !
911 , pal .
hey , buddy .
how are you ?
fine .
you ?
beverly .
what a bunch of handsome old men .
hi , good looking .
richie !
i' d rather catch you than anybody else in the whole world , beverly .
i just saw all of you and so much came back .
it was like a tidal wave .
mike , what are we getting ourselves into ?
hi , bev .
hi .
oh , i' m so proud of you .
where' s ... .
you all right , bev ?
yes .
no , i ... .
i saw something today .
same here .
oh , man .
what i saw at the library , whoa !
was it pennywise ?
with both barrels it was pennywise .
he' s working on us already .
maybe that means he' s afraid .
it .
it' s afraid .
oh , man .
it !
help us remember .
fill in the gaps .
yeah , please .
because i don' t know what you guys are talking about .
i can' t remember much of anything .
when i try , it kind of clouds over .
i mean , didn' t you feel it ?
as i crossed the county line , this veil dropped over my eyes .
maybe it' s the water .
the water ?
maybe it' s the sewer .
this is battery acid .
eddie !
eddie , take a breath , man .
breathe .
i' m okay .
big white guy , red nose ... ... about 75 feet tall , mouth full of razor sharp teeth ... .
oh , eddie .
what the hell is happening ?
i mean , what is going on ?
i' m sorry .
it was just a very vivid memory .
i stared that creep right in the face .
and you saved stan' s life .
you remember that part ?
yeah .
yeah , now i do .
speaking of stan .
stan ?
where' s his royal straightness , anyway ?
you talked to him , right ?
yeah , i think he' il be along .
we ought to go ahead .
we can fill him in .
talk to us .
i don' t know about you ... ... but this is the first time since i got here that i feel good .
come on .
let' s have drinks , huh ?
don' t you want some food , have a couple of chucks ?
spoken like a real loser .
hey , to the losers ' club .
all right .
to the losers ' club !
wives " ?
how many times have you been to the altar , richie ?
four or five .
women all want the same thing .
no offense , bev .
none taken , creep .
welcome to the fourth century .
how about you , ben ?
you married ?
no .
i' ve dodged the bullet .
how about you , eddie ?
me ?
i' m seeing this wonderful woman .
with the business , i don' t have time .
take it from me , better dead than wed .
any crumb snatchers , richie ?
none that i know of .
how about you , bev ?
what ?
how about you ?
i live with a ...
no , i' m not married .
richie , what ever happened to those glasses ?
contact lenses .
for all the times you broke them ... ... you should' ve had stock in a tape company .
yeah , me and henry bowers .
henry bowers .
tell me he was hit by a train and put out of his misery .
no such luck .
you' il find him at the juniper hills .
after he confessed to killing all the kids .
he was in the sewer with us .
that creep was gonna kill stan .
all of us !
when they pulled him out , his hair was white .
he was babbling .
about a clown .
no one believed .
except that he killed the kids .
and we didn' t say anything .
not a word .
but it was the killer .
and we stopped lt .
we thought we did .
henry .
henry bowers .
up here , sharp stuff .
up here .
you helped me once .
remember ?
you chased those brats .
almost got them , little henry .
almost .
don' t you want another chance ?
you gotta go back and finish the job .
you gotta go back to derry and kill them all .
for me , henry .
kill them all , henry .
kill them all .
kill them all ... .
well , sports fans ... ... this has been a real hoot .
but i got a plane out .
richie ?
you' re not leaving ?
what do you want ?
an adventure ?
you' re gonna go relive that old nightmare ?
count me out .
i' m going to a hotel .
i' m gonna sleep .
in the morning , i' m out of here forever .
richie ...
i' il remember all of you fondly .
hey , man , we' re all scared .
maybe he' s right .
if you' re talking about going back ...
we don' t know what we' re talking about .
give mike a chance to fill us in before we scatter .
is that too much to ask ?
all i' m saying is i' m gonna go get sleep !
why don' t we show a little courtesy !
it' s all right .
if he wants to go , he goes .
we all came here based on a promise .
everybody made good on that promise .
wherever we go from here ... ... i have no expectations .
well said .
it' s all right .
it' s taken care of .
no , hey .
you can' t do that .
guys , that' s just the way it is .
all right , then .
a toast to mr. michael hanlon ... ... without whom none of this would be necessary .
i see my fortune .
you' re gonna be eaten by a big , greasy monster .
have a nice day .
dummy up , everybody .
what is it ?
what' s wrong ?
is something the matter ?
he had an asthma attack .
he' s better now .
no , much better .
thank you .
everything was okay ?
everything was fine .
fine .
thank you , rose .
guys , i' m not so sleepy anymore .
let' s get the hell out of here .
is this the uris residence ?
is stan there ?
this is mike hanlon , an old friend .
what are we supposed to do now ?
no problem .
a little soap and elbow grease ought to clean it right up .
why are we the only ones that can see this ?
well now , there you' ve got me stumped .
let' s ask the answer man .
oh , mike ?
oh , michael !
garcon !  hold on just a sec .
hello , stan ?
is this the uris residence ?
i' m trying to get ahold of stan .
you tell that loser he' s a dead man !
we all managed to show up .
that matches your real hair .
anyone told you ... .
is anyone from out of town ?
i just flew in from l. a. and boy , is my tail section tired .
we' re hot tonight .
it' s great to be in derry breathing in that derry air .
i' ve never felt so much love in my entire life .
i want them on my christmas mailer .
no .
denbrough over there , let' s put him on my norman mailer .
i love this man .
he' s like the brother i never had .
he is the brother i never had !
beep , beep , richie .
stan ?
thank you .
stan is dead .
he cut his wrists in the bathtub .
right after i phoned him .
stan was the last one to see it that summer .
remember ?
all summer long he kept saying , " that just isn' t empirically possible .
seeing the clown didn' t make it real for him .
nothing did .
until that afternoon in august .
i was coming down chestnut street ... ... and i saw stan running like something was after him .
go !
hi yo , silver !
away !
i can ' t say i saw anything .
stan ' s the one who saw it .
i was pedaling too fast .
hell , i didn ' t want to see it , whatever it was .
it took him hours to tell me what happened .
he said he was down in lampkin park by a bird feeder , watching birds .
like a good boy scout .
remember , he used to call it collecting birds ?
stan ... .
stan !
he said he didn ' t mean to go into that house ... ... but this voice kept whispering to him .
naturally , being stan , he figured there was a rational explanation .
hello ?
stanley .
yeah ?
i' m right here .
he was trapped .
he held his bird book out in front of him ... ... and said the names of birds he could remember .
longneck finch , speckled grouse , baltimore oriole ... ... great egret , hammerhead woodpecker , brown thrush .
brown thrush .
the day that we went into the sewer , stan saw lt .
face to face .
not the clown .
but he saw what was behind the clown .
he ran up to me in school .
and he said , " i saw it , eddie .
i looked right into its ... .
some kind of lights .
i looked right into its deadlights .
i looked into its deadlights ... ... and i wanted to be there . " deadlights .
i need a drink .
yeah , me too .
i' ve got something here .
anyone else ?
yeah .
sorry i' m late .
well , let' s see who' s here .
billy boy !
richie , you still here ?
nice nose job .
no one would suspect .
haystack !
putting on weight ?
bevvie , your dad isn' t worried .
he loves your choice in men .
how' s your sex life ?
what' s your sex life ?
mikey , you got us all here .
it' s the only way you' d see us , since you' d never leave this town .
i made it , guys .
i' m in the deadlights now .
it' s true what they say .
we all float down here .
and you will too .
in fact , they all float !
they all float !
oh , my god !
my god .
i don' t know about you , but i' m sick of this place !
i will listen to anything , but could we do it someplace else ?
please ?
okay .
just help me with this stuff .
bill , what is it ?
he ... thrusts his ... .
he thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees the ghosts .
that' s all it says , over and over .
my mom gave me that ... ... to say ... ... to help with my stutter .
no offense , pal .
it ain' t helping .
let' s get the hell out of here .
what do you say ?
henry .
down here , henry .
belch ?
what are you doing there ?
you got a problem in there you need some help with , henry ?
that' s a good boy .
you don' t have to talk .
i can hear you when you think it .
they can' t hear me .
what do you want , miller ?
same thing you want .
i want to pay them back .
yeah .
pay them back .
you' re gonna have to get out .
you' re gonna have to go back to derry .
i need you , henry .
we all need you .
they can ' t hurt you .
we didn' t think they could hurt us , but they did .
bested you .
don ' t talk about that .
i can take care of them if they only half believe .
but you' re alive , henry .
you can get them if they believe , half believe or don' t believe .
one by one , henry .
i can ' t get out of here .
they got wires on the windows , and koontz is on the door tonight .
man , koontz is the worst .
i hate him .
i' il take care of koontz , henry .
lead the way , henry .
lead the way .
all right , i' ve had it !
your head' s gonna be bouncing off the floor ...
no , no , no , mike .
no , no , no .
i will have no need of this stuff .
thanks for thinking of me ... ... and including it just in case , but none for me !
thank you !
richie , you' re shouting .
i know .
beep , beep , richie .
beep , beep .
talk to us , mike .
tell us stories .
tell us things so we don' t have to remember what we saw in the library .
hey , eddie .
come on , pal .
don' t let it get you .
fight it .
i saw myself .
i saw myself back there .
i know it' s just camphor water , but i need it anyway .
take it easy , pal .
if it works , it' s good .
you' ve believed in it ... ... and that' s all that ever mattered .
thanks .
you all remember what was going on in derry 30 years ago .
there were killings , maimings , disappearances .
mostly children .
everybody was afraid but nobody did anything .
until we went after lt .
we almost killed lt .
bowers confessed and the killings stopped .
until now , 30 years later .
if you count backwards by 30 ... ... every date corresponds to a disaster in derry' s history .
1960 : the fire at the black spot club .
1930 : the explosion at the old ironworks .
1900 : the massacre at drake' s creek .
and on , and on .
the biggest mystery is how 253 settlers disappeared without a trace .
thank you for that illuminating , if somewhat morbid history .
she didn ' t want to know .
you knew all about this .
even then .
miss douglas didn' t want to know .
it' s a disease , bev .
none of them wants to know .
it' s too horrible .
they act ...
like it didn' t happen .
i remember a man , mr. ross .
he was on his front porch .
i was coming home from school .
henry bowers was waiting .
right outside my house .
i saw mr. ross across the street .
he looked so concerned .
i thought he was going to help me , but ...
i couldn ' t believe it .
he just turned around and went inside .
that was when it hit me .
there was something terribly wrong in derry .
how did you get out of that ?
daddy came home .
one of the only times i was really glad to see him .
it' s 30 years later and the killings start up again .
at least six so far .
there' ve been many disappearances .
i wanted to be certain before i called anyone .
and i became certain when i found something at the latest crime site .
god , that was just yesterday .
anyway , this is it .
georgie ?
for some reason , there' s something special about us being together .
that summer , our togetherness made us strong .
otherwise it would have picked us off one by one .
is it an accident that none of us have kids ?
even stan ?
although when we came together ... ... we were , well , we were all losers .
now look .
six of you left derry and became unusually successful .
real winners .
leaving you holding the bag .
you kept the light on for all of us .
i feel bad about that .
me too .
it' s nobody' s fault .
our parents decided who stayed and who went .
i stayed here because i wanted to .
you stayed because you had to .
i don' t know what' il happen tomorrow .
but i do know that i appreciate what you' ve done for everyone .
good evening .
how much farther is derry ?
i guess about maybe 500 yards to the city limits .
thank god .
i nearly fell asleep a while ago .
i' ve been driving forever .
just cross the old bridge at the barrens and hang a left .
the barrens ?
where the kids used to play .
thank you .
i' il be going now .
don' t you want your balloon first , mrs. denbrough ?
don' t you want it ?
don' t you want it ?
they chased me up the hall and started slapping me .
and the coach found me lying there .
i thought he' d help , but he made fun of me .
and something snapped .
i said , " you coach track , right ?
he sneered .
i said , " you listen to me , you son of a bitch ... ... i' il run down everything you' ve got ... ... and then i want a flipping apology from you .
all right !
and so you did it .
yeah , i ran everywhere .
sometimes i thought i' d pass out .
the first time i ran a mile , i puked , then fainted .
finally , i was holding up my pants as i ran .
i ate salads like crazy .
by march ... ... i' d lost 70 pounds and grown two inches .
i felt like i could fly !
and you went out ?
i went out for track .
the first day i won the 220 and the 440 .
i blew everyone away .
after practice i asked for that apology , and he hit me .
after all that ?
it was perfect .
you beat him .
and everyone knew it .
i got a letter in track from el paso high ... ... and the coach lost his job over that little love tap .
you should write that one down .
bill' s our writer .
i just write horror stories .
so , what are we gonna do ?
oh , mikey , mikey , mikey ...
listen , kids ... ... it doesn' t matter how painstakingly we go over these sewer plans .
or how many flashlights you' ve got in the box .
when the sun comes up , i' m dust and i' d suggest we all get out of dodge .
i cleaned it up once .
cleaned what ?
the blood .
i cleaned the whole thing up that very same night .
if i was ever gonna sleep in this house again , i' d have to know the truth .
to see if anyone besides me could see the blood .
what happened in here ?
did somebody get murdered ?
you see it ?
you really see it ?
come on .
let' s clean this up .
until that moment , i thought i was going crazy .
it was strange to be happy about something so grim .
i fell in love with all you guys that day .
and after we cleaned it up , the blood never came back .
it' il be morning soon .
i' m cold .
me too .
i' il get you something .
there' s a shawl in my room .
give me your key .
i' il get it .
richie , do you have a key ?
all right , now listen up .
stay together , guys .
no stragglers .
just get the first thing you find .
ben , don' t go alone .
uh , i need a refill anyway .
i' il join you .
i' il take care of richie .
be back in three minutes .
no more .
hello , nigger .
i' il pay you back .
pay you all back .
oh , good .
you found it .
i' m glad we' re alone .
i' ve been wanting to say something to you .
your hair is winter fire january embers
my heart burns there too it was you .
i' ve been waiting a long time to thank the poet .
did you ask bill first ?
no .
i knew it was you .
i' ve always known it was you .
i think i must have been waiting until we were both ready .
i' m ready now .
are you ?
oh , oh , beverly .
kiss me , fat boy .
belch ... !
you all right ?
i got it .
get him in there .
come here .
watch it .
easy .
easy .
hurry up !
go , go , go , go .
if mike dies there will be five of us left .
who comes next ?
which one of us ?
why is it doing this ?
why does it hate ?
why is it so mean ?
oh , ben .
i want to tell you something .
you remember what my father was like ?
i fell in love with a man who ... ... turned out to be everything i always hated in my father .
why would i do that ?
how could i be so blind ?
if you see it now , you' re not blind anymore , bev .
congratulations .
that' s a miracle .
besides , at least you fell in love with somebody .
at least you felt something .
that' s a miracle too .
you have the heart of a poet , ben .
your hair is winter fire
why' d you say that ?
you wrote it , didn' t you ?
your hair is winter fire january embers ...
something .
it was you , wasn' t it ?
is that you or the clown ?
what' s going on ?
how am i supposed to know ?
it' s me .
what ?
it' s me .
my heart burns there too
he' s gonna be okay .
can we see him ?
he' s not out of the woods yet .
one of you can go in for a minute .
everyone else is right outside .
henry ?
he' s dead .
police ?
not yet .
we can' t trust anyone .
if anybody asks , a party got out of hand , dancing on the table , you fell .
anyone who' s seen me dance will buy that .
what are you gonna do ?
i don' t know , man .
i honestly do not know .
my jacket .
outside pocket .
hey , it' s silver .
it can kill it .
but we left these down in the se ...
you went back ?
i was pretty sure it was asleep .
pretty sure ?
you went alone ?
ten years ago my life was going downhill , close to suicide .
i really wanted it to kill me .
i stumbled around in the dark all day .
i found one .
in the drain trap .
the one that hit pennywise was lodged in the wall .
i figured we might need that kind of help again one day .
when i came out i kind of got my life together .
the only change was this .
almost overnight .
fear .
bill , if you decide not to use those ... ... if you leave , i' il understand .
that is a dead body .
are you suggesting we leave it lying there ?
that' s right .
we should call the police .
right !
you don' t get it .
this whole town is it in some way .
all of them .
if we call the police , get the town involved ... ... something bad' s gonna happen to one of us .
have it your way .
stan is dead .
mike came close .
i' ve seen enough .
i' m with you .
you can put this behind you ?
i' m a little old for monster hunting .
so was mike .
so was stan .
is that how you feel , ben ?
all i know is i can' t stay in this room much longer ... ... so i suggest we turn on the tv , go out and figure out what to do .
i second that .
police chief rademacher said the victim ... ... danielle huxton , had been playing near her home .
police didn ' t say if this was connected ... ... to the recent disappearances of children .
they did reveal that the body was severely mutilated .
in other news , a series of robberies has officials baffled ...
you can put that on my card .
certainly .
me too .
thank you .
ditto .
thanks .
i had loads of fun .
gotta go .
bye .
need a ride ?
where are you going ?
airport .
i guess we are too , bill .
come with us .
i just saw something .
and i have no idea if it was real ... ... if any of you would' ve seen it or not .
i can' t go .
because if i do i' m gonna live with this until i go insane .
until i can' t tell the difference between my life and my bad dreams .
for years i' ve been getting paid to scare people .
but i' m the one who' s been scared .
all my life .
i don' t want to be scared anymore .
i' m going back in .
this time i' m gonna kill lt .
help me .
help me .
please help me .
did anybody bring anything useful , like a machine gun ?
i brought this .
it' s the only thing i saved .
you were a dead shot .
couldn' t miss .
it was like it was supposed to be .
you broke pennywise' s head open .
inside was light .
bright lights .
deadlights .
we saw them too .
how on earth ... ?
mike went back down and got them .
these are for him , and for stan .
lucky seven .
we' re all here now .
what the hell are you gonna do now ?
sing " kumbaya " ?
wake up .
take a breath .
you smell that ?
that' s death .
it' s not for mike , or stan , or henry .
it' s for us .
it' s in the air .
losers fight it , losers die .
you don' t have to go down there .
i didn' t have to get on a plane in l. a.
i sure as hell didn' t have to come out here .
and now i don' t have to go in .
i still say we should have brought a gun .
i remember the first thing i saw down here was one of those damn pom poms .
this purse , it looks new .
oh , dear god !
it' s not possible .
what ?
audra .
what ?
how in god' s name ... ?
she' s down here .
his wife ?
it' s got her .
it' s probably a trick .
bill , wait , damn it !
bill !
come back , bill .
do you want to get yourself killed ?
god , bill !
are you all right ?
it' s my fault .
she followed me .
my ...
my fault ... .
bill !
if she is down here there' s only one way you can help her .
now you know what we came down here for .
we need you to stand up for us like before ... ... or none of us is going to get out of here !
come on .
stay close together .
looks like we' re off the map .
i think ... .
that way .
we' re here .
my god .
the roots all grow down .
yeah .
the walls cracked .
when it came .
don' t let these things come to life .
don' t think that , spaghetti man .
i told you not to call me that .
i think something' s coming .
my boat .
georgie .
it' s all your fault .
oh , georgie .
all your fault , bill .
you sent me out and it killed me .
no , no , georgie , i ...
i didn' t know .
bill , remember , that' s not georgie .
remember .
fight it !
it was in the drain , bill .
and you let it kill me .
no , i loved you .
bill , that thing' s not your brother .
come on , man .
fight it .
you are not george .
george is dead .
and it' s not my fault .
you killed my brother george , you bastard .
let' s see you now .
let' s see you now .
show yourself .
you killed my little brother ... ... and now you' re gonna pay .
go !
while you still can .
this is your last chance !
show yourself .
silly boy .
you still think you can see me .
you' il never see me .
you' il see only what your little mind can allow .
go !
now .
for if you stay ... ... you' il lose your little mind in my deadlights .
like all the others .
like all the others .
bill , we can' t fight that thing .
it' s like fighting smoke .
don' t you understand what mike was trying to tell us ?
it feeds , richie .
it wakes up every 30 years and it feeds .
and in order to feed it has to take on some kind of physical form .
it' s here .
down here somewhere .
fee , fi , fo , fum .
are we strong enough ?
we have to be .
i have to tell you guys something before we go in there .
i' ve been lying .
about what ?
when i said that i was seeing someone .
well , i' m not .
in fact , i haven' t ever .
i mean , i' ve never even been with anyone .
are you saying you' re a virgin ?
yeah .
well , i can' t help , pal , but thanks for sharing .
richie , let him talk .
you see , i could never sleep with somebody that i didn' t love ... ... and i' ve never really loved anyone ... ... except you guys .
for god' s sake !
wait for us .
it' s audra .
i' m going to get her .
damn you to hell .
please , dear god !
he thrusts his fists against the posts ... ... and still insists he sees the ghosts .
it' s taking him .
bill !
come on , guys !
we gotta ...
bev !
bev , where are you going ?
what am i gonna do ?
this is battery acid , you slime !
i believe in santa claus .
i believe in the easter bunny .
i believe in the tooth fairy , but i don' t believe in you .
this is battery acid .
now , you disappear .
please , god , don' t let me miss again .
hey , nice shot , bev .
don' t you talk .
you' re gonna be fine , spaghetti man .
richie , please , for the last time , don' t call me that .
you know how i ... .
this isn' t over .
if that thing comes back when i' m 70 ...
let' s finish lt .
once and for all .
audra !
it' s all coming down .
i guess that' s how i' d like to remember us ... ... there by the lake , the sun setting on our childhood .
this will be my last entry .
i got it in just in time .
just before the fog in my brain swept all my memories away entirely .
now , i look back in time not from memory but from the pages of this book .
the nightmare is over .
police involvement was cursory ... ... as is always the case here in derry .
now that there' s no need for a lighthouse keeper , i may move on .
see whatever is down the road a piece .
richie' s still knocking them dead .
he' s got a part in a movie .
he co stars with a guy ... ... the lucky seven could tell you looks like eddie kaspbrak .
okay , cut .
ben and bev left derry together , headed west .
they married , and later , they were pregnant .
another curse broken .
bill and audra are still here .
sadly , audra ' s condition is unchanged .
they' re leaving today .
okay , audra .
it' s time to go .
bill thought the time here might somehow help .
but i guess audra ' s gone for good , one of it' s many casualties .
locked in that haunted place where she saw it' s deadlights .
bill came every day .
we laugh at our failing memories ... ... sometimes asking each other' s names .
his sadness is profound .
i wish there were ... ... something i could have done .
hi yo , silver !
away !
wait .
audra , this bike saved little stan' s life once .
mine too .
we were going so fast , we beat the devil .
i don' t know if i can go that fast again .
hold on .
beat lt .
beat lt .
beat lt .
beat it , audra .
beat lt .
beat lt .
come on .
come on , beat lt .
bill ?
where are we ?
what are we doing ?
it' s all right .
just hang on , babe .
it' s okay .
