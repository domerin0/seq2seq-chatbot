calm down , dear .
listen .
take a left , then the second right , then a left again .
ok .
goodbye , sweetheart .
ls maris lost again ?
she wandered into the kitchen by mistake .
i had to talk her back to the living room .
any chance of getting a table ?
no .
they got their check five minutes ago , but theyve been sitting there ever since .
i shoot them dirty looks , all in vain .
show me the look .
theyre there for a while .
shall we order ?
why not ?
what are your coffees today ?
zimbabwe and kenya .
ooh , lil have a zimbabwe latte .
lil have a kenya cappuccino .
so whats new ?
the gardener finally won the battle of the wills .
he got maris to dig up her camellias so he could put in that zen garden .
how did it turn out ?
lts beautiful .
the perfect place for meditation .
yesterday i found maris sitting in the lotus position .
good for her .
lts bringing out her spiritual side .
she was reading danielle steele and making a nail appointment on her phone .
do you realise that its a year since i moved from boston ?
really ?
a year ?
it seems like yesterday dad moved in with you .
people can have opposite impressions of the same event .
look at them .
sitting there like they own that table .
lets both give them the look .
lts worth a try .
it worked !
niles , lil never doubt you again !
try the look on that table .
lm going to the mens room .
maddening !
what ?
the moisturiser dispenser in the gents .
the cream is too oily , so i re washed .
and then the hand dryer breaks down .
how do you get through the day ?
here you go , zimbabwe and kenya .
thank you .
did i say decaf ?
no .
oh , lm sorry . lf i drink the regular stuff , itil keep me tossing and turning through my brothers conversation .
no problem .  thank you .
nobodys leaving .
lets take a table outside .
why not ? lm feeling al fresco .
oh , how does mrs fresco feel about that ?
must be a riot on camping trips .
would you like a ... ?
no .
now that chapter two of your life is in full swing , can i ask you something ?
sure .
are you happy ?
did you hear the question ?
yes , lm thinking .
lts a complex question .
no , its not .
it is .
either youre happy or not .
are you ?
no , but were not talking about me .
lets not gloss over that .
you have just told me youre not happy .
why ?
i was watching pbs the other night a documentary on the great depression .
vintage steinbeck .
poor people escaping the dust bowl , their meagre possessions on rickety , old trucks heading to their salvation .
you see this scruffy little boy being handed a new pair of shoes .
frasier , if you could have seen the look on that boys face .
it was a look of pure and utter happiness .
i have never experienced that kind of happiness in my life .
not even when i bought these $400 bruno maglis .
do you like them ?
very nice .
what about the tassels ?
lm not a tassel guy .
neither am l .
nevertheless , there they are .
i have no reason to be unhappy .
i have my health .
i have a wonderful home , a beautiful wife .
did your eyebrow just move ?
no .
i have my practice .
but lve lost the ideals that led me to psychiatry in the first place .
who am i talking to ?
psychiatrys answer to the drive through window .
sometimes i wonder if lm not just in it for the money .
oh , i wouldnt say thats true .
lf it were ...
oh .
what were you going to say ?
ld rather not .
theres no need to .
i know what youve wanted to ask me for years : did i marry maris for the money ?
i resent that !
i did not marry maris for the money .
it was just a delightful bonus .
so you really do love her ?
of course i love her !
but its a different kind of love .
you mean , its not human ?
no .
i mean , it doesnt burn with the passion of a tristan and lsolde .
lts more comfortable , more familiar .
maris and i are old friends .
we can spend an afternoon together , me at my jigsaw puzzle , she at her autoharp , not a word spoken between us , and be perfectly content .
lm told it was a lot like that near the end in the hitler household .
lets shift the subject back to where it belongs .
i asked you whether you were happy .
just answer .
well ...
hey , guys .
hi , roz .
what are you doing here ?
i always wanted to fly a jet , and today theyre offering a special on jet flying lessons .
i came here to get coffee .
thanks for stopping by .
ld have been mad if you didnt .
lm also meeting someone here .
oh , let me guess .
a man ?
yes .
yes .
the new guy from the news department caught me checking him out .
he was bent over the water fountain .
love at first sight .
he said , lets get some coffee and get acquainted .
lve got a strange feeling that this guy might be the one .
you say that about every guy you meet .
lets just see if this one calls back .
yeah , i guess .
you know , i dont think hes here yet .
lil go snag a table .
good luck .
bye , roz .
yeah .
i dont think she likes me .
it isnt a question of liking or not liking .
she despises you .
really ?
i warrant such strong emotions ?
i barely acknowledge her existence .
you may be on to something there , sherlock .
she is comely in a back alley sort of way .
shes very attractive .
did you ever think about you two ... ?
roz and me ?
oh , no .
oh , come on !
never fantasised about stealing away to a motel with her ?
lm a man with normal urges , and she has a silk blouse that opens a bit when she leans over the cart rack , but ...
oh , mixing work with romance ...
ls it ever worth it ?
dont ask me .
youre the one that looked down her blouse .
decaf zimbabwe latte .
ls that non fat milk ?
no .
i hate to be a bother .
lts just that lm watching my fat intake .
ls that rain ?
no , god is crying .
cant i ask a simple question ?
do you ask any other kind ?
hey , how the hell did she get a table ?
oh , frasier , frasier !
there !
oh !
frasier !
oh , niles , niles !
oh , good block !
sorry !
good work there .
i just wanted it a little more than he did .
oh , boy , its really coming down .
what ?
something happened the other morning .
i asked dad to pass me a bran muffin .
you know what he said ?
he said , whats the magic word ?  youre kidding !
he didnt find it amusing when i said rest home .
oh , oh , oh !
look , look !
that must be rozs coffee companion .
wow , hes really handsome , isnt he ? wow ?
did you say wow ?
good lord , i did .
i dont think lve ever said wow describing another man before .
does that mean something ?
it means youre a gay man .
your life with maris is a charade .
come out of the closet .
you want to tell dad or shall l ?
this was stupid !
this whole idea was stupid !
admit it .
no !
you needed exercise .
it was stupid to come out without your bumbershoot .
lts an umbrella !
speak english !
sorry , no dogs allowed .
what ?
oh , lm sorry .
lts ok .
oh , niles ?
hello , dad .
what are you two doing here ?
i felt we needed some exercise .
i had to pick up some beans anyway , so we walked .
well , one of us was dragged by his collar .
i told you i didnt want to come .
look at me , lil die of pneumonia .
youil outlive us .
the cranky ones always do .
lets get you something hot to drink .
you want a cappuccino or ... ?
can i help you ?
coffee , black , nothing fancy in it .
we have two special coffees today ...
lil surprise you .
oh , joy .
theres nothing like the smell of a wet dog to work up the appetite for supper .
were soaked to the skin !
youre in a fine mood today !
you left a mess in the kitchen .
i had toast !
yeah , and you buttered it on the counter .
i know because you left crumbs and toast sweat there !
toast sweat ?
yes , yes .
when you put hot toast on any surface , it leaves drops of dew .
havent you heard dads lecture on the evils of toast sweat ?
lts the scourge of our times !
one coffee , black .
and a decaf , non fat zimbabwe latte .
oh , dear , is that cinnamon on that foam ?
as long as were picking each others scabs here ,
i found eddies chew toy in my sweater cubby .
hair all over my favourite pullover !
he sleeps in there !
because you keep sweaters in a cubby .
oh !
well , my bedroom is off limits to this flea bag .
hes not a flea bag !
how about those mariners ?
shut up , niles !
lf my hips good enough to get me here , maybe its time i found a place of my own !
where will you go ?
dont worry . lil find a place .
lve got a little money saved up .
i never wanted to move in with you .
l dont want to be a burden to anybody !
thats frasiers smartass way of telling me hes heard this .
you wont have to hear it again .
tell daphne to catch up with us .
we go through this melodrama every week !
sit down !
no .
how much for the coffee ? $1 . 50 .
for coffee ?
what kind of world are we living in ?
you were in that bathroom forever .
i tried that damn hand cream .
lm so oily , i couldnt grip the doorknob .
when some guy came in , i said , am i glad to see you !
i cant even begin to describe the look he gave me .
there it is .
so , lm told you and your dad are at it again .
whats new ?
lately , hes had a face as long as a wet weekend .
yesterday , when i insisted he do his stretching exercises , he told me to stick me feet behind me head and spin like a top .
the best thing to do is to ignore him when hes like that .
lsnt that right , niles ?
niles ?
lm sorry .
for some reason , lm feeling a little dizzy .
lil go after him .
oh , here .
take my bumbershoot .
thats nice .
at least someone appreciates my mother tongue .
lve always had an ear for your tongue .
oh , niles !
what did i say ?
want another coffee ?
not until lve had my first one , thanks .
why is it always so difficult between me and dad ?
look at it from dads point of view .
as a policeman , he had authority .
thats been taken away .
criticising the world , he controls his shrinking sphere of influence .
i do empathise with him . lts just ...
i cant help wishing to kick that cane out from under him sometimes and that he would land on eddie .
lts hard .
i know youre trying .
i am .
sometimes , i see the fruits of my labour .
the other night , dad was watching tv .
ld fallen asleep on the couch .
suddenly i stirred .
i felt something on my head .
dad was standing there , stroking my hair .
dad ?
did he say anything ?
yeah , he said , dont you think its time for a haircut ?
you look like bozo .
i know he was covering .
what do you think ?
wouldnt hurt to get a trim .
no ...
do you think he was covering ?
of course .
you know dad .
tough as nails on the outside , but on the inside , one giant spike .
grazie .
excuse me .
what about mine ?
we have a team of specialists working on it .
lets change the subject from dad and talk about something else .
yes , about something light and frothy .
i agree .
are you in love with daphne ?
thats a little frothier than i had in mind .
that is preposterous !
i refuse to dignify that question with an answer .
i dont know .
there , i said it !
are you happy ?
why did you have to hire venus herself ?
why not a beefy , eastern european scrubwoman who reeked of ammonia ?
i asked , but it was an olympic year .
the agency was fresh out .
frasier , i cant get her out of my mind .
daphne stirs a passion in me lve never known before .
youre not considering leaving maris ?
no .
i suppose the situation youre in is that youd like to stay with maris but have an affair with daphne .
yes .
can i do that ?
no , you cant .
i thought that i couldnt , but you got my hopes up there for a minute .
oh , its easy for you .
youre free , youre happy .
you havent answered that question yet .
i havent ?
no , you havent .
are you happy ?
well , i guess the best way i could think of saying it is ...
this sucks .
whats the matter ?
youre having coffee with a man and think he might
lead you to something like , oh , i dont know , a life ?
suddenly , the trapdoor opens and youre right back in rozs world .
how did it go so wrong so quickly ?
simple .
he just wanted to convert me .
i have nothing against religious people .
lm ecumenical .
i embrace men of all faiths .
lf only it stopped there .
he pretended it was a date . lsnt there a commandment against that ?
no , they didnt go into dating until the new testament .
roz , lm sorry .
why dont you join us ?
no , thank you .
theres a cute new handyman in my building .
lil just go home , slip into a negligee and rip out my faucet .
you think shes kidding , dont you ?
i think about rozs life , and it makes me wonder about my own .
i havent been exactly burning up the social scene lately .
youil find somebody .
but what if i dont ?
what if i end up old and alone ?
i might have to buy a funny little dog and move in with frederick .
i dont have to worry about that for a while .
no .
frederick should worry about that .
you might try answering my original question : are you happy ?
i guess ld have to say ...
hello , boys .
oh , for petes sake .
dad , what are you doing back here ?
i dont know , i ...
lve been acting like a jerk lately , and taking it out on you and daphne .
all that stuff i said earlier , forget about it .
i already have .
come on , eddie .
dad , listen , has something been bothering you the last few days ?
no , no .
come on .
nothing .
ls something bothering you ?
just tell us .
just say it .
ok .
last sunday was my birthday .
of course it was .
frasier and i planned a big surprise party , but on your birthday it wouldnt have been a surprise .
thus we waited a week .
so , surprise !
oh , if you could see the look on your face .
just give it up , niles .
dad , lm sorry .
oh , no .
come and have a seat .
you know , i dont know why i let it bother me .
all those years on the force , i missed enough of your birthdays .
you know what ?
we can still celebrate .
weil take you out to dinner tonight .
you dont need to do that .
absolutely .
you name the place .
ok .
how about hoppys old heidelberg ?
oh , great !
great !
they were voted best bratwurst in town .
ach du lieber !
lve been on third street looking for you .
i was on fourth street .
eddie had smelled everything on third .
how did you know i was here ?
one of me psychic flashes .
bang !
there you were walking into caf nervosa .
you were apologising for the way youve treated me this week .
lm sorry about that .
just forget about it , all right ?
and something about a raise ...
youre winging it now .
am i that transparent ?
no , lm psychic .
the boys are taking us out to hoppys old heidelberg for dinner .
oh , great .
german food !
we whip the jerries twice this century , and they still have the last laugh .
dad , sorry , i cant give you a ride .
lil give him a lift .
ah .
lve enjoyed getting together with you for coffee .
what do you talk about all the time ?
sports , chicks , monster truck rallies .
ok , dont tell me .
zimbabwe , decaf , non fat milk , no cinnamon in sight .
now ...
are you happy ?
you know , in the greater scheme of things , yes , ld say i am .
# baby , i hear the blues a calling tossed salads and scrambled eggs
# quite stylish
# and maybe i seem a bit confused well , maybe ... but i got you pegged !
# but i dont know what to do with those tossed salads and scrambled eggs
# theyre calling again #
see you next year !
we love you !
