my son ...
i had a dream last night , the sun was shining , there were flowers everywhere .
come on , sis , we' il be late for school !
zach , look !
oh no , that machine is going to crush the flower .
we have to do something !
stand back , cynthia .
zach !
a scambocop !
halt !
do not proceed !
you are trespassing in a restricted zone .
hurry , zach !
central , machine breakdown in progress .
copy , unit 12 .
do you need any back up ?
negative , central .
situation under contr ...
another flower saved from mayor scamboli' s grasp .
little brats ...
they don' t appreciate the magnificence of the city i' ve built for them !
it' s the metropolis of the future , the pinnacle of progress ...
yes boss .
you said it , boss . ... the temple of technology ...
just look at my city , scamboville .
instead of trees and grass , there' s steel and glass ...
concrete , asphalt !
and thanks to me and my tireless efforts ...
yay , hurray for mayor scamboli ! ... we have soaring towers , gleaming industries , mega brained robots ... ... i could talk to you about scambo welfare for retired robots ... about scambonuses for outstanding robot achievements ...
about ...
you ... ... about robo nursing for depressed executives ...
but what' s the use ?
do the children really appreciate my hard work ?
we do , boss .
right !
and i won' t let those little termites destroy my creation ...
never !
cabby .
do you know what bothers me most about children ?
they don' t pay taxes ?
worse .
it' s their ...
whiny little voices i can' t  hi daddy .
marlene !!
ha !
you know you' re not supposed to barge in here .
hello , sweetheart .
i' m so happy to see you .
come give daddy a kiss .
i' ve got a hot new program for you , robots .
want to try it out ?
oh no ...
don' t ! ...
no !!
don' t , marlene !
trust me , it' s wicked .
please , no ... not again ...
marlene , will you ever grow up !
you' re ruining my robots !
you and your silly robots ...
who needs them anyway ?
kids need to play and have fun , you know .
scamboville is fun .
not for us .
nonsense .
what ?
haven' t i created special passageways ... just for kids to walk to and from school ?
you don' t get it .
scamboville is all about work and technology .
there' s no room for play .
of course there is .
every building over thirty stories has an authorized de stressing room .
but nowhere for kids to be happy , daddy .
we need our own space .
your own space ...
contain all the children in one single place ? !
yeah !
what a brilliant idea !
alright .
i' il build you one .
you will ? !
yes .
a place just for kids .
and i' il call it scamboland .
really ?
when will it be ready ?
in no time at all .
my fellow citizens .
what i have created for the youth of scamboville is no ordinary entertainment !
it is the latest in technology !
a world of rides and fun , so totally new and unexpected ...
s s sca sca sca scambbbb ... boli ...
tonight , i am personally inviting every child in the city to ... attend the grand opening of scamboland .
i promise you all a good time .
you children will never get over it !
ah !
finally !
spencer !
spencer !
your butler is in the freezer , mr. geppetto .
sneaking a cold one .
thanks , house .
spencer , come out of there !
i need your help .
it isn' t bedtime , spencer !
upsey daisey !
t true , doc , doc .
b but as aunt pengwend says ,
' early to bed and early to rise , gets you the scummy worm surprise ! '
d did you see who was on tv , huh ?
hurry , spencer .
it' s time .
time ?
it' s always time for ... a good cup of coffee .
you mean he' s really , r really r ready ?
hurray !
better late that ends well !
to work !
the clock is ticking !
as as as cousin penguinevere says , time is golden ...
spencer ! ... and silence is money .
power it up .
very slowly .
high high tension mounts .
the atmosphere is abuzz with electricity .
current affairs are about to run their course .
the energy in the room is super charged ...
look at all the lights and lasers !
i hope there' s a ferris wheel .
scamboland ...
i' il believe it when i see it .
i can' t believe you really did it dad !
you socket wrench !
jump , rodo .
i' il catch you !
don' t miss .
silence !
i mean ... ... welcome , kids ... junior citizens of scamboville !
it is my honor as your mayor , fulfilling my duty to you ... as responsible members of our fair city to offer you ... ... rides like you have never even dreamed of !
full power , spencer !
my daughter marlene will now have the honor to cut the ribbon .
oh no .
not now , you old rascal .
we' re losing it .
we' re losing it .
we don' t have enough power !
did you pay last month' s bill ?
go on .
go ahead .
cut the ribbon ...
where are the scissors ?
uh , scissors ?
the scissors !
i ...
i don' t see them .
i don' t see them .
i' ve got it cranked up to the max .
i don' t see them .
robots ...
ready for the big surprise ?
i hope you' re ready for a bigger one , scamboli .
plug us into the city mains , spencer !
the city mains , doc ? !
5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ...
zero ...
now !
turn those lights back on !
told you it would never work .
don' t go !
everything is under ... ... control .
we' il see who gets the last laugh !
dad !
ahh !
pinocchio !
uncle spencer !
oh , pinocchio ...
i' m overworked , i mean o overturned ...
i i mean overweight ... no , over ...
hello , pinocchio ... ...
welcome home .
what is this ?
i' il explain it to you someday .
now we' il have all the time ... in the world .
oh pinocchio , we' il do so many fun things together ,
like playing .
i' m going to create the most wondrous toys for you .
will we play ball ?
sure .
and all sorts of games .
i' il make up bedtime stories for you .
funny ones , scary ones ...
with bug eyed monsters ? !
if you like ...
and we' il explore the world together .
the jungle , the mountains ...
and then you' il grow up , and ... you' il get married , and spencer will be your wedding photographer .
grow up ?
spencer , you know he can never grow up .
oh , i ...
why ?
son ...
you see , i' m afraid you' il never ask me to button up your coat ... because it' s cold outside .
but ...
i don' t have a coat .
i think what doc is trying to tell you , pinocchio ... is ... is that ... ... you' il never be ...
cool .
firecrackers !
i feel good .
who died ?
is this a funeral ?
mom !
easy , robo boy .
i ain' t nobody' s mama .
i' m just the local ... fairy .
turn around , boy .
let me have a look at ya .
very design , geppetto .
but then again , you' re italian .
looks like my toaster .
i love chrome .
so , what' s he do ?
i mean does he do housework ?
heavy lifting ?
no , no .
he' s my son .
how do you know my name ?
cyberina always keeps up with current events .
cyberina ?
spencer , doll , close that beak before you catch a fly .
look at my coils !
did i really program this ugly ' do ?
recoil !
there ...
i can do tricks too .
oh really ?
and i can name the 23 galaxies in the union of astral nations ...
in reverse alphabetical order .
oh , impressive .
of course , he' il also go to school like all little boys !
hello ?
like all little boys ?
geppetto , you do remember he' s a robot .
i love him like my own son .
you' re my dad .
i love you too .
alright , geppetto !
programming love is quite an art .
pinocchio , you know your dad' s dearest wish ...
and i know this because i' m a fairy , and we are clairvoyant ... ... his biggest wish for you is to be a real boy .
you know i can make his dream come true .
what do you say ?
sure !
good .
but , first you have ... to learn the difference between right and wrong .
no sweat .
load the program !
i' m a super quick learner .
slow down that hard drive , honey .
it' s not that easy .
learning right from wrong is something you have to feel for yourself .
now , i can give you a couple of hints , reminders really .
you' il get it eventually , honey .
your dad has given you a sharp mind and a warm heart .
now you just put them together and i' m sure it' il come to you .
you can do it , son .
and once you have ...
i' il turn you into a real kid .
deal , cyber boy ?
saved to memory !
where' d she go ?
out there ... ... and in here .
don' t worry .
it' s not as hard as you think to learn right from wrong .
granny penguindolyn used to say , " there are 9 ways to skin a cat " ...
spencer ! ...
of course , being a penguin , she could never skin a cat ...
spencer !
she couldn' t even hit a nail on the head .
zip it !!
sorry .
chair .
tomorrow , you' il go to school .
but now , it' s time to close your eyes and sleep .
sleep ? !
close my eyes and sleep .
saved to memory .
they think they can mock me ?
a simple blackout and those little brats turn their back on me ? !
oh no .
now , they have a problem .
a major problem .
major problem .
what problem , boss ?
me !
i want you two to go ... to the school , get every one of those pint sized parasites ...
back to scamboland right now !
we' re on it , boss !
not yet , you component !
helppppp ...
now , just be yourself at school .
school bag .
a and listen to what your teacher says .
calm down , doc .
now remember , chew your food ten times ...
before you speak .
but robots don' t eat .
don' t mix him up with your sayings , spencer .
doesn' t my son look good ?
say " cheese !
hurry .
you' re going to be late .
bye dad .
my son ... in school ...
you should be proud , mr. geppetto .
scamboville is so big and beautiful , spencer .
all the skyscrapers and , and flying machines ...
there' s so much to look at .
watch out , pinocchio !
and all the activity everywhere ...
i just love it here .
listen to all those noises .
it' s so alive .
it gives me a feeling ... ... of being safe and secure .
is everything ok , spencer ?
pinocchio ...
you have to wait for the flashing light to come on before you can cross .
wait for the flashing light to come on , before i cross .
saved to memory .
does that mean it' s " wrong " to cross at a flashing light ?
yesiree .
very wrong !
then why are they stopped ?
well , b b b because it' s different for them .
so , sometimes a flashing light means stop , sometimes it means go ?
not exactly .
i i mean , i mean , yes , yes , well sort of , sort ...
it it depends .
it depends .
spencer , i think i have a memory conflict .
there are no right conflicts .
just wrong solutions .
saved to memory ...
but , could you run what' s right and what' s wrong past me one more time ?
well , to make a short story long ...
my fellow citizens ...
scamboland is in full operation now and open for all ... of scamboville' s children .
now that' s wrong .
everything that man says is wrong .
you can' t trust him .
he' s always up to tricks , no treats .
his name is ...
mayor scamboli .
tickets !
get your free tickets for scamboland !
free tickets for scamboland !
who doesn' t have one ?
me !
you don' t need one , you rivet .
free tickets for scamboland !
no thanks .
i want a ticket !
stay away from them , pinocchio .
oh , i did wrong again ?
' never take a ticket that' s a token to a wrong turn ! '
wrong turn ?
hey spencey ,
who' s the kiddie robot ?
a toy ? !
can i play with him ?
quiet , wing nut !
they' re funny !
remember , doc geppetto ...
wants you to go to school .
mr. geppetto ? !
geppetto builds great robots .
let' s see how tough he is .
over here !
ok , cyber duck .
you are toast !
if you can' t join them , beat it !
hasta la pasta , baby !
cabby !
wind me back uuuuuup .
i' il pick you up here at 5 .
saved to memory .
mr. geppetto really made you ?
he' s my dad .
my name' s pinocchio .
look , he invented this for me .
it' s called a funbrella .
it makes any day sunny .
it even makes bad moods go away .
hi cynthia !
hi zach !
love your umbrella .
what' s a robot doing at school ?
i' m a kid just like everybody else .
what a funny trick !
sorry .
i' m just a clumsy robot .
h he' s funny .
who needs scamboland now that we have pinocchio !
he may be funny , but he' s just another geeky robot .
oh yeah ? !
i' ve got a p3k imagination module , the latest technology !
imagination ? !
you' ve got to be kidding .
that' s a human thing .
a robot wouldn' t get it .
come on , pinocchio .
we' il be late for school .
follow me ... and i' il prove to you that ... a robot has no more imagination than a can opener .
pinocchio , are you gonna let her challenge you like that ? !
we' il show her robots aren' t dumb , heh heh , right ?
right ! ...
uh , i' d like to , but i promised dad i' d go to school .
poor robot promised his daddy .
pinocchio ? !
pretty cool ride , huh ?
uh , wasn' t scared .
not ... much .
i' il be fine in a minute , rodo .
ready to be beaten at the imagination game ?
how do you play ?
you' il see .
come on !
bow to the audience .
what audience ?
i knew it !
no imagination .
cyberina !
ladies and gentlemen !
welcome to the imagination game !
on my right ... the reigning champion ...
maaaarleeene !
and on my left ... embarking on his first flight of imagination ...
piiiii ...
aren' t you supposed to be in school , honey ?
oh , yeah , well ...
piii .. nooooo ... chio !
may the best imagination win !
but ...
i still don' t know how to play .
it' s a piece of cake , robo boy .
it' s like flying .
just open your wings and instead of flappin ' ... you imagine .
imagine ?
yes !
what' s the difference
between a robot and a man ?
what' s the difference ?
what' s the difference
between a program and a heart ?
what' s the difference between me and you ?
i got my own emotions i' m dancing like a puppet
i' m so fast with connections speeding like a rocket
my world is only fiction there' s one thing i can' t do
with my imagination i' m gonna make it true
what' s the difference between the machine and a smile
what' s the difference ?
what' s the difference
between a program and a heart ?
what' s the difference between me and you ?
let the music play let me do it my way
it' s my intuition
let the music play let me go my way
i feel that emotion i' m gonna have some fun
let the music
let the music
control
let the music
control
your body , your soul
i gotta admit , you' re pretty good .
you weren' t so bad either .
very , very hip , both of you .
what do you say , audience ?
but , there can only be one winner of the imagination game ... and that winner is ...
maaaaaaar leeeeeeeene !!!!!
no !
this is lame .
i was better than her !
hey !
keep the stupid medal , zinc head .
i knew it .
you' re just a ... robot .
so , who won ?
ask pinocchio .
he knows better than everybody else .
hurray !
pinocchio won !
yo , robots !
i won fair and square !
you don' t say .
i imagined 56, 232 terraplops of information .
she only imagined 40 thousand , 41 tops .
honey , when you lose the fight , takin ' the medal ain' t right .
but , my ideas were better .
you' re a naughty little ' bot !
oh yeah ?
well , i like being a robot .
who wants to be a boy , anyway !
and i won no matter what you say .
imagination game ...
way to go , pinocchio !
can i have your autograph ?
well , to be totally honest , marlene won .
her ideas were better .
i promised to go to school .
i better get back there .
forget school .
i think the boss should meet you .
the boss ?
mayor scamboli , of course .
scamboli ? !
i' m not supposed to listen or talk to him .
spencer says he' s bad .
and always wrong
do you want the boss to hear ya ? !
but i  that' s ridiculous .
the boss is good and always right .
now , come on .
wait !
let me compute this out .
you say he' s good .
spencer says he' s bad ...
this must be like the flashing light .
it depends .
yes .
saved to memory .
ok , rodo .
let' s go .
it' s so tall !
so , this is the famous pinocchio !
you' re so much smaller than your hologram .
i mean ... just , just a ... a bit smaller .
what is this imagination game where you beat my daughter ?
marlene is your daughter ?
i don' t deserve the medal .
she won it .
i like this robot .
of course she won .
she' s the mayor' s daughter .
what' s so special about a mayor ?
a mayor watches over the entire city .
that' s us down there !
could i see my house on here ?
nothing to it .
hey !
that' s dad .
dad , over here !
he can' t hear you .
but we can hear him .
my poor pinocchio .
where is he ?
i hope nothing bad has happened .
dad !
so , you like games ?
i know .
i was supposed to be in school .
not at all !
i mean why go to school when you can go to ...
well scamboland , for instance ?
cabby and rodo already ...
gave me tickets .
we did , boss .
we did .
i wish the other children were like you .
but they won' t listen to me .
at least we do , boss .
you can always count on robots .
we know how to obey , and ...
we' re smart .
yes , the robot is truly man' s best friend .
life would be great , if kids were more like us .
you' ve got a good point , pinocchio .
i couldn' t agree with you more .
i i' ve made an important decision .
you are going to be the star of scamboland .
me ? !
why me ?
kids need a friend .
a robot to entertain them .
and you' re just right for the job .
right ?
accept , pinocchio , accept !
right !
hi kids .
i' m your friend , pinocchio .
i know a special place where only kids and robots are allowed !
come experience the fantastic new rides and attractions .
i want you all to join me !
i must convince pinocchio to come home .

good work , geppetto .
that " son " of yours has been very useful .
alright .
two kids in every car .
no shoving .
yeah !
what' s happening ? !
how do you like my little scambobots ?
cute , aren' t they ?
of course , i couldn' t have done it without you , maestro , your brilliant research was so useful to me .
you' re a genius of an inventor .
it' s almost a pity your relevance to me is over .
but you have a few minutes left .
sit back and enjoy the show .
oh , you want to join the fun ?
it' s designed for kids .
of course , i i could make an exception in your case .
alright , let' s give pinocchio the dad he deserves !
marlene !
it' s yours .
you won it .
it ... it' s the first time anyone has ... done anything ... so nice .
you zinc head .
n n n no , not marlene , you idiots !
bye !
enjoy the ride !
what' s happening ?
marlene !
this ride' s not for you !
anyway , scamboland is closed .
cabby , rodo , shut everything down !
we' re going home , marlene .
what ?
but , where' d all the kids go , uncle scamboli ?
don' t you ever call me uncle again .
but i i
and stay away from my daughter , robot .
i' il hang out with whoever i want .
don' t waste your time with a failed experiment of geppetto' s .
i' il give you real robots for friends .
pinocchio' s no failure .
and he' s my friend whether you like it or not .
come on , pinocchio .
standing up to your father for me like that ...
you' ve got guts .
this is my garden .
i love it here .
it cheers me up when i' m sad .
do you get sad often ?
well , it isn' t easy with a father like mine .
i love him , but ... sometimes i wonder if he loves me as much as those two dumb robots .
that' s ok , they are dumb .
i love my dad , too .
though , i wish he would have come to see my show .
i love to lie here and gaze up at the peaceful stars .
and pretty soon , my problems don' t seem so bad .
i know i' m still just a robot , but if i could have a friend , i' d want her to be just like you .
good night .
pinocchio ?
no !
stop !
you' re not allowed in here .
they' re destroying the last piece of green in scamboville and you laugh ! ?
a at least it doesn' t tickle .
you really are a robot .
alright , i' m a robot .
i like metal .
you like metal ?
here !
i don' t need a circuit board for a friend .
a and i don' t need a ... tree hugger for a friend .
robots know how to appreciate metal .
cabby !
rodo !
can i help ?
sure !
we could use an extra hand .
deadbolt , we are not supposed to speak to him .
w what are you talking about ?
come on .
it' s time for our next show .
the kids must be waiting .
you don' t get it , do you ?
no .
remember when you told the boss
life would be great , if kids were more like us .
well , i guess you got your wish .
aren' t they cute ?
no !
it can' t be .
you' re lying !
your nose should be growing !
scamboli !
how could you ? !!
cyberina !
please help me !
dad !
i' ve got to find dad !
hey !
that' s my shuttle !
okay , let me think .
if i push this to go up ...
no ...
okay , maybe pull down to ...
that was close !
flashing light means i go .
pursuing an unidentified driver .
oh , i wonder what this is for ?
when the flasher goes off , i stop !
i am ushering in a new technological
some drivers ...
hello , pinocchio .
lovely day , isn' t it ?
not right now , house .
oh , pinocchio !
spencer ?
where' s dad ?
he isn' t with you ?
oh , yeah yeah , not good , not good .
he left for scamboland to get you away from scamboli .
i haven' t heard from him since .
it' s all my fault .
i thought scamboli was my friend .
spencer , we have to get to scamboland and find dad fast !
come out with your hands up .
you are under arrest for reckless driving .
oh no .
a scambocop .
hello officer , lovely day , isn' t it ?
i am arresting you for reckless driv
you have to break some rules to make an omelet .
for the last time  " time " ?
it' s always time for a good cup of coffee .
thanks , house .
hurry , spencer !
dyiiii ...
freeze !!
only geppetto could have invented a robot even worse than a child .
but now that little interfering gearbox has gone too far .
come on !
well , a glimmer of brains for once , you rivet !
i thought i forbade you to
was the idea to use pinocchio to soften me up ?
a robot .
i should have known .
you two .
outside .
one day , you' il thank me .
for destroying every last piece of nature ?
stay here !
yes .
there' s much less maintenance now ...
you' re going through a green phase , darling .
i can understand that , but i' m simplifying life for you .
take the children , for example .
are you still here ? !
what about the children ?
you two .
back in here !
i' ve turned them into robots !
you' ve what ? !
trust me .
it' s for their own good .
and i' m going to program them all to be your friends , like cabby and rodo .
stop it !
it' s all wrong !
don' t you see that ? !
what are you two doing here ?
get out !
stay !
i see that i' ve tried my best to build a better world for my daughter , and she thinks it' s all a failure and that i' m not a very good father .
oh , daddy .
for just once , couldn' t you do something good ?
i' m trying .
then free the children , daddy .
bring them back .
this discussion is over .
come on !
daddy !
dad !
daaad dy !!
doc gepppppettttto !!
daddy !!!!
help me , please !
i have to find my father !
do you know where he is ?
my little scambobots won' t listen .
too bad .
maybe thls is what you' re looking for .
you' re a monster , scamboli !
i prefer to think of myself as a practical man .
and practically speaking , i don' t need you any more .
why don' t we dismantle him for spare parts .
catch him !
hold it right there , scambobots !
i think someone else should have the honor of taking pinocchio apart .
metal suits you , geppetto bot .
no !
not dad .
you you can' t .
correction , minibot .
i have !
say cheese !
you two !
catch them or i' il turn you into key chains !
yeah , on it , boss !
don' t worry , dad , i' il be back .
i' ve got him !
this way , spencer !
in here .
follow me .
the tunnel of danger .
excellent choice , pinocchio .
i don' t like the looks of this place .
careful , pinocchio !
don' t forget scamboli built this ride .
the penguin' s right .
welcome to the tunnel of danger .
the rules are simple .
i create obstacles , you avoid them .
if you crash , you go to the big scrapyard in the sky .
now for the fun part .
i like hot rides ... but not thls hhhhhhhooootttt !
we' re gonna crash !!!
that' s right .
bye bye .
not quite yet !
this game was meant to be played by two sides , wasn' t it , daddy ?
hang on , pinocchio .
marlene ? !
now this is better .
this reminds me of home .
robots rule !
go pinocchio !!!
you screwdriver !
we' re rootin ' for the boss .
only two more to go and we win !
unfortunately , you forget who designed this game .
you' re cheating !
now , you are the obstacles !
pinocchio ...
when you lose the fight , takin ' the medal ain' t right .
do you like metal ?
here !
come on , spencer .
you won , pinocchio .
you rule !
looks like you lost , daddy .
now , free the children !
lost ?
oh no .
scamboli never loses .

what' s the difference
between a robot and a man ?
what' s the difference ?
what' s the difference
between a program and a heart ?
what' s the difference ?
between me and you ?
i got my own emotions i' m dancing like a puppet
i' m so fast with connections speeding like a rocket
my world is only fiction there' s one thing i can' t do
with my imagination i' m gonna make it true
what' s the difference between the machine and a smile ?
what' s the difference ?
what' s the difference
between a program and a heart ?
what' s the difference between me and you ?
let the music play let me do it my way
it' s my intuition
let the music play let me go my way
i feel that emotion i' m gonna have some fun
let the music play let me do it my way
i feel that emotion i' m gonna have some fun
let the music
let the music
control
let the music
control
your body , your soul
let the music control
your body , your soul
what' s the difference ?
what' s the difference
between me . between you ?
between me and you ?
