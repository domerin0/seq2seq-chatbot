he works in the beverly hills gun club .
he does ?
this ain' t the guy , he' s a weasel .
this isn' t a master criminal .
that' s his print .
this guy had nothing to do with bogomil getting shot .
lf he suspected him , he would' ve picked him up .
let' s put an apb out on cain .

i' il go .
i' il go .
see ?
would you lighten up and take some risks ?
fuck it .
let' s go .
shit .
alarm tape .
there are ways around alarm tape .
lf we open this door , the connection will break between the magnets .
lf we use this foil , and you squeeze it between the two magnets , then take your gum to hold it in place ...
now the magnets have the illusion that the connection' s not broken .
then we take our knife ...
open the door without ...
we walk in without the alarm going off .
you' ve done that before .
i wasn' t always a police officer , i fractured a law or two as a kid .
can i have a piece ?
it' s my last one .

yes , he' s under my command , but he' s assigned to some multi jurisdictional , federal task force .
i never know where the hell he is .
it' s a real pain .

max fucked it up for everybody , so let' s just go home .
we' il go ahead as planned .

you picked dent' s pocket ?
i told y' all i wasn' t always a cop .
yeah , you fractured an occasional law as a kid .
this is not good .
this is not good .
see ?
every now and then , an occasional long shot pays off .
dent' s accountant , sidney bernstein .
anything dent' s into , he' il have a record .
we' il visit him tomorrow .
it' s all we got to go on .
there' s no b and d , i' m looking for something .
and what about that cement truck ?
what about that , rosewood ?
talk to me !
i have a theory on that .
the cement truck was a tactical decoy .
a decoy ?
a diversion to protect the criminals ' getaway .
that' s why it rammed the police car .
have you submitted yourself for drug testing yet ?
i want you in by thursday .
understand ?
are you aware that whoever was in that truck foiled the goddamn crime ?
do you ?
putz .
did you say something ?
he called you putz .
no , i called you a putz .
he' s right .
putz .
and you .
you , mr scribbler ...
what the hell were you doing there , foley ?
aren' t i a police officer , too ?
remains to be seen .
did you call lnspector todd for me ?
yes .
he doesn' t like you very much .
do you hear this insubordination ?
yes , and i' ve never heard such abuse .
whatever' s happened , the fact remains that the robbery was foiled and the money was saved .
lf i were you , i' d concentrate on cracking this code and determining where the e crime will be .
there' s not many targets beginning with e , so find them .
i will , ted .
mayor !
yes , mayor .
and you !
i want you out of here !
get out of here , you degenerate !
you' re not even part of this department !
ls this a black thing ?

aren' t you leaving for detroit ?
today at noon .
you' re not going to make it .
you' re going to get fired .
we started this together , we' il finish together .
check if bernstein owns a car .
give me a pen .
give me a pen !
' 86 mercedes .
license number crl 507 .
naturally , i can see ...
i mean , i understand .
somebody ...
wait ...
come right in !
don' t let the fact that my door' s closed dissuade you from entering my office .
beverly hills police .
are you mr sidney bernstein ?
lucky guess .
you have 25 unpaid tickets .
we have a warrant for your arrest .
25 ?
what 25 ?
you have 25 unpaid parking tickets .
i pay all my tickets .
do you own a black mercedes benz , license plate number crl 507 ?
507 ?
that' s my wife' s car .
you have 25 tickets .
it' s under my name , but it' s my wife' s car !
no , no , no !
bitch !
these tickets haven' t been paid .
can you cuff mr bernstein ?
there are people out there with chainsaws !
you have unpaid tickets and it' s your car .
we' re taking you in .
wait .
i' ve got an idea . ls there something that i have in this office that i could hand to you and that would make you kind of forget that you' re holding those little pink tickets there ?
what are you saying ?
you' d have something in that hand and this hand you' d forget about .
that hand you' d go , " what did i have there ?
i don' t remember .
you mean if i had ... .. $200 in this hand ?
ouch !
let go of my arm . $200 ?
ouch !
please , i' m robbing you .
that' s what i' m doing .
here' s one , here' s two .
they' re real crisp .
i have to use your computer to wipe all evidence of this transaction out .
no problem .
no problem at all .
thank you , sidney , so much .
certainly .
certainly .
also , one other thing .
i' m sure you understand my contact at headquarters wouldn' t want his name to be known .
don' t i know it .
could you excuse me while i ...
yeah , it' s secretive .
it' s like a james bond thing !
yes , yes .
thank you .
no problem !
no problem at all .
anything you want to use .
i can' t believe ...
i don' t want to hear it , billy .
jan , axel .
how you doing ?
what do you got ?
strange .
before 1978 , everything' s blank .
it' s classified , but its policy date is 197 4 .
i found something interesting in our foreign office in london .
dent was the cultural attach to the east german embassy in honduras .
he' s got a racetrack , shooting club , drilling rig companies , an oil company .
oil company ?
that' s his biggest business .
but from these records , seems like dent' s in trouble .
he' s let his insurance lapse on everything in the last six months .
dent petroleum , even the shooting club .
all his businesses except one .
which one is that ?
the racetrack .
empyrean fields .
he' s got a huge policy on that one .
good , good , good , good , good .
ok .
great .
when your father wakes up ...
he' s better .
he' s up and around .
tell him you found his man .
bye bye .
empyrean fields .
rip off his own racetrack ?
yes , if it' s insured .
what was in the files ?
we won' t find oil field equipment
if we find dent .
lf we find him ?
dent' s visa application had today' s date on it .
lf we don' t step on it , he' s gone .
i don' t know what happened on the city deposit , max .
and the foley hit ?
i don' t know .
that' s why i need you to go along personally to make certain nothing goes wrong .
i' m on the team , of course .
i broke it .
you son of a bitch .
you beat the computer ?
what' s it say ?
" chinguen sus puercos , carlos .
screw you cops .
signed , carlos .
" puercos " ain' t cops .
pigs .
another word for cops .
wait a minute , carlos ?
it is cain .
charles cain .
carlos is spanish for charles .
cain changed his name .
he didn' t want to grow up to be poor .
cain is the alphabet robber ?
i ain' t said that .
the first code was very hard .
this is easy .
whoever did this wanted the cops to get it .
you ran numbers ?
i wasn' t always a cop .
he fractured an occasional law .
the horses have now reached the starting gate .
freeze !
hit the floor !
freeze , goddamn it !
1 : 30 .
1 : 15 .
30 seconds .
time !
goodbye , mr cain .
.. winning it by a nose .
general was second and marshall' s madness came third .
our horse didn' t come in .
cain' s did .
the result is now official .
the winner , johnny' s dilemma ...
police officers !
police !
we' re a little late .
all i can tell you now is that we are confident that we have identified the alphabet bandit .
the man was shot dead at the scene this morning by security guard jack stiles .
ln his latest robbery attempt , the man was fatally wounded .
so i give you my oath right here there will be no f crime .
my computer team cracked the alphabet bandit' s code this afternoon .
all of the notes , mind you , were signed " carlos " , right ?
carlos , which , as you all know , is spanish for charles .
do you hear what i' m saying ?
lf it' s cain , where' s the money ?
where' s dent ?
you said shipping oil equipment .
but how ?
where ?
let' s put an apb out on dent .
for what reason ?
where' d you get that ?
what ?
it' s coming from there .
excuse me .
how did the mud get on the horse ?
he was grazing in the pasture .
where' s the pasture at ?
there .
dent' s oil field .
bogomil had that red mud on his sneakers .
maybe he got a tip , he came here and they tried to waste him .
who pulled the alphabet jobs ?
dent' s going broke , ok ?
so he heists some bank , heists some jewellery , then throws this easy code with cain' s name on it .
simple .
you frame cain , kill cain ,
cain' s the alphabet killer , dent gets away scot free .
why would an oil man risk this , even if he was broke ?
dent' s not buying oil equipment , he' s buying guns from thomopolis .
selling them in central america .
why not split with the cash ?
dent buys guns here for a million and sells them there for 10 million .
look at all that oil .
i don' t see oil .
i see trucks .
come on , billy .
billy , what are you doing ?
i' ve been wanting to wear this for a while .
are you nuts ?
billy , we have got to talk .
what the hell is this ?
you can never have too much firepower .
come on !
shit .
bogomil was here .
you like rap music ?
yeah .
i' m from the rap coalition of america .
throw that gun over there .
lf you like rap music , why ain' t you smiling ?
i' m smiling .
smile .
let' s rap together .
those look like oil pumps to you ?
it looks like world war ill .
here , billy .
you don' t have one of these , do you ?
you guys hang around the back , i' il check out the front .
what are you doing ?
element of surprise .
what ?
are you nuts ?
fool the connecting wire into thinking it' s still intact .
these documents will make your life much easier .
you need to sign them .
you still got that thing ?
it' s a bad idea .
of all the ideas you had , this is the worst .
sure you know what you' re doing ?
trust me .
come on , axel !
get him !
get your head down !
pull pin .
what are you doing ?
" extend .
pull open and ... " wow !
release safety .
aim through there , push this .
fuck rambo .
get me the fuck out of here .
cover me .
go , axel !
let' s get the hell out of here !
hold it !
stay right there !
freeze !
all right !
lay your weapons down !
mr foley .
you involved yourself in business that doesn' t concern you .
that was a mistake .
goodbye , mr foley .
women .
come on , let' s go .
police !
you' re under arrest !
i think they know that , billy .
drop your weapons !
put your hands on your heads !
they got their hands up .
what took you guys so long ?
shit .
we' re in trouble now .
god damn it !
axel' s awol .
we can get out of this if we keep quiet .
don' t say anything .
what the hell have you done here ?
looks like a goddamn war zone .
what have you done , taggart ?
we solved the alphabet crimes .
shut up .
who the hell is talking to you ?
i solved the alphabet case over an hour ago .
and you !
i don' t give a damn who you' re working for .
you' re in jail .
chief ...
shut up .
what are you doing , bringing a fire fight to my city ?
you' re out of the cop business !
will you just listen a minute ?
you shut your mouth !
no goddamn !
you shut up !
this is what the alphabet crimes are about ... guns !
that guy sold them , then bought them with stolen money from adriano' s at his own racetrack .
he was going to central america .
lf you' d take your head out of your ass , you' d see we solved the whole thing !
lutz , why didn' t i know about this ?
chief lutz doesn' t have the guts to hear the truth .
we had to go undercover with foley to solve this case .
you' re fired , taggart !
yeah ?
kiss my ass !
kiss mine !
you' re fired , too !
lutz , i' ve had it with your abusive attitude .
i' m sorry .
i get carried away .
you' re fired .
