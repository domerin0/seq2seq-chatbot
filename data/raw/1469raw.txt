most people don' t see it .
or don' t want to see it .
the evidence is right there .
but they refuse to make the connection .
we have colleen on line one .
oh .
absolutely .
we are living in a world of high strangeness .
the fact is .
all this activity stated happening at a cetain definite point in our history .
before the early ' 50s .
there' s nothing .
then it all began .
the sightings .
the signals ... too many to deny .
so you have to ask yourself ...
what specific event caused this sudden uptick in alien visitation after thousands of years of silence ?
it was our atomic energy .
they detected it .
i mean .
that many megatons ?
how couldn' t they ?
and then .
they followed it here .
what do they want ?
are they studying us ?
warning us ?
havesting us ?
we don' t know .
but the fact is they' re here .
they' re here now .
and they are not going away .
mercy , six two actual .
we' ve lost visual contact .
say position .
over .
roger , six two .
stand by .
chopper' s lost us .
i think we took a wrong turn .
can' t see a damn thing out here .
friday .
april 13th .
my last day alive ... maybe .
what does that matter when so many have died before me ?
they said she was beautiful .
i suppose she was .
the pat of her that was human .
anyway .
and the pat that wasn' t ?
what about that ?
did the men she killed understand .
in some final flash before dying .
what she really was ?
cold .
indifferent .
inhuman .
insatiable .
and terrifyingly wondeful .
and what about the civilization that beamed her dna code through space ?
they knew we' d use it .
knew we' d mix it with our own genes .
but did they know the monster that would result ?
twice .
she was built .
twice .
she brought destruction .
and now it' s my turn to take eve' s body .
take her dying dna and somehow create something better .
more pure .
only then will we understand why she was sent .
only then .
slow down .
easy .
she' s dead .
i don' t think she cares at this point .
you up from the reserves or something ?
something like that .
wait .
what ?
the road .
we' re supposed to be on a gravel road .
the one we passed back there .
pull over , man .
i told you to stay on the road !
did you hear me ?
i said pull over .
six two , this is mercy .
put down the radio .
now .
i said put it down now !
okay !
okay !
chill out !
what are you , back from iraq or something ?
shut up .
now get out .
jesus fucking christ !
anybody !
this is mercy !
cargo' s alive !
repeat , the cargo is alive ...
now get out as i told you .
what the hell are you doin ' ?
mercy six two , come in .
do you read me ?
over .
do you read me ?
over ?
nothing .
find them .
are you ...
eve .
i got him .
16 miles east southeast .
looks like they' re not moving .
still no contact ?
mercy six two , come in .
come in .
do you read me ?
over .
negative .
send a ground team in there to meet us .
six two ground .
six two ground .
this is six two actual .
rendezvous .
mercy .
coordinates .
87 foxtrot .
over .
can' t see anyone down there .
let' s pay ' em a visit .
who' s he ?
specialist robert kelly .
who else was here ?
just the driver .
where' s his body ?
no idea , sir .
i want a full autopsy .
check every inch of this ambulance and destroy it .
and find that driver .
yes , sir .
good afternoon , sir .
this monster' s been sucking in natural gas and spewing out electricity for over 50 years .
now , you might be wondering why we still need this in the 21 st century .
after all , it' s loud , expensive , inefficient , temperamental , and it smells terrible .
and it' s the best way we have of keeping the lights on .
but , if you follow me , i' m gonna show you how we' re gonna put it out of business .
come on upstairs .
come on in , folks .
just gather around here .
how' s it going , guys ?
okay , dean .
warning ...
ladies and gentlemen , meet the tokamak .
you' re looking at a prototype fusion reactor .
the university cut a deal with the city to build this down here .
now , we' re just in the experimental stages , but soon , everything from cars and cell phones to washing machines , and even spacecraft , will be powered with clean , limitless fusion energy , all courtesy of the atom .
how does it work ?
glad you asked .
glen , you wanna fire this thing up ?
sure .
we take hydrogen and deuterium , put them together inside the reactor , and then heat the mixture to 10 million degrees .
we then try to get the two elements to combine or fuse , which would produce a staggering amount of energy .
basically , it' s how the sun works .
so you' re telling us inside that thing , it' s as hot as the sun .
yeah .
isn' t that dangerous ?
yes , it is .
very .
but don' t worry .
inside the tokamak are a series of magnets powered by the plant here .
the magnets keep the super hot plasma contained at all times .
positive air flow keeps the room pressurized , and the walls here are six feet thick , which is two feet thicker than the walls in the pyramids of giza .
that' s a little trivia for you .
now , i' d love to be able to fire this thing up myself and show you , but unfortunately , there' s only one guy who can do that , and that' s the head of the department , with his own personal access key .
and now , for the highlight .
on sublevel c is the plant cafeteria , where i understand the grilled cheese is excellent , but the tuna fish sandwich is not .
i' d love to join you , but i gotta get back to class .
so , anyway , thank you very much .
thank you .
thank you so much .
thank you very much .
no problem .
thanks a lot .
have a good day .
bye bye .
behold , the t 4 bacteriophage virus ... nature' s most elegant killing machine .
look at it .
it' s beautiful , isn' t it ?
invading our living cells , it has killed unabated since the beginning of time .
who made it ?
where did it come from ?
what immortal hand or eye framed this dreadful symmetry ?
you know what , just between us ,
i think ...
who are you ?
i' m dean .
dean ?
of what ?
leisure studies ?
no , dean' s my name .
an atrocious one .
sorry , sir ?
i don' t even think you' re in this class .
yes , i am .
i think not .
because if you were , dean , you obviously would have arrived on time along with the rest of your classmates .
won' t happen again , sir .
as i was saying , between us ,
i think we made these viruses , you and i.
they' re our own renegade microbes , escaped from our cells ... evolving , mutating , they become our curse , our punishment .
multiplying our sorrows ... the perfect predator .
it' s hardly perfect .
what was that ?
nothing .
no , no , no .
repeat your comment .
well , it' s just that you said that viruses are perfect , but they' re not .
for one thing , they can' t reproduce on their own , and that' s their achilles ' heel right there .
without a host mechanism , they' re just slowly dying proteins .
it seems we have a future cdc administrator among us .
i don' t get it .
on level four of the center for disease control , there are preserved in frozen nitrogen the world' s last remaining strains of smallpox ... strains which are now scheduled for destruction .
rendered extinct .
like the dodo bird , dinosaur ... ... and i guess that pleases you , right ?
who are you to judge which species lives or dies ?
what ?
what the hell was that ?
specist .
specist ?
someone who' s prejudiced against other species .
yeah , i know what it is , but of all the things i' ve been called ...
did you get beat up on the playground a lot ?
shut up .
got any change ?
yeah .
word .
come on , man .
i will buy you something nice out of the vending machines .
thanks .
uh huh .
it' s ' cause i like you .
dean !
can i have a word ?
shit .
i gotta go , dude .
i got an online auction , you know ?
yes , dr. turner ?
as you know , being your department head , it' s my responsibility to review your funding .
i must say i' m concerned with what i' ve seen .
concerned ?
you' re all over the place !
physics , biochemistry , bioengineering ... too many interests , too few results .
especially for graduate level work .
sir , lately the tokamak' s been giving us a very ...
oh , forget it .
the tokamak' s history .
fusion power' s a pipe dream !
what ?
we' re ending our contract on it by the end of the month .
so you either find yourself an approved project overseen by a professor ... or you forfeit your scholarship next semester .
is that clear ?
wait , wait , wait .
you' re cutting the funding ?
you can' t cut the funding !
i can do anything i want .
no , sir , just listen to me for one minute !
asshole !
cat ?
cat ?
cat .
i' m hungry .
how did you get out of the lab ?
i' m hungry !
i' d be , too , if i grew six inches a day .
lobster .
what ?
they play it every hour .
red lobster .
for the seafood lover in you .
what else did you learn from television today ?
no , no , no .
if you eat upstairs , use silverware , all right ?
this is a fork ... this is a knife .
but with lobster , you take the fork and you stick it in there like that , and you pull it down and you ... pull .
sara .
excuse me ?
you don' t have a name .
sara .
yes .
sara .
before you fall asleep , i want you to promise me something .
i won' t lock you in here anymore if you promise not to leave this house .
ever .
because the outside world is dangerous for you .
dangerous ?
you' re gonna grow up very fast .
your childhood ...
lasts only days , not years .
see , you were the third generation of something very special .
an alien species ... ... created with a new sequence of dna , received in a transmission from deep space .
that' s right .
some of my colleagues tried to study your kind .
things ended badly .
i won' t make those same mistakes .
i just want to protect you because ...
i think ...
i think there' s a message , a very important message , inside you ... a reason why you' re here .
someday , you' il tell me what it is ... in your own time .
are there others like me ?
not like you .
you' re unique ... and the most important thing in my life .
wouldn' t worry .
she won' t be giving you any more trouble .
signature ?
wait a minute .
wait just a minute .
this can' t be right .
pregnant ?
she was .
gave birth , too , from the looks of it .
the yellow copy' s yours .
i just need the top copy for my records .
no records .
this never happened .
and burn the body .
now .
yes , sir .
abbott ?
dr. turner here .
i' ve been looking everywhere foryou .
that repot to the foundation ...
i' il need to account for how you' ve been using their funds .
why ?
if line items are too much trouble .
then just give me a general ...
damn .
look , dr. turner , i really don' t have any time for ...
dr. abbott .
yes ?
tell me , where is it ?
where' s what ?
who are you ?
where is it ?
look .
listen , i don' t know what you' re talking about , or who you are ...
you can either leave now , or i' m gonna call security .
there is no ... security .
hang on .
i' m getting help .
you don' t ... recognize me , do you ?
no .
the ambulance ... that night ... in the woods .
remember ?
you were the boy .
a half breed .
how did you get in that ...
where did you ...
i escaped ... into the world .
how did you find me ?
things will go much ... easier for you if you tell me where it is .
you' re having respiratory failure .
look , until i know what' s going on , i can' t help you , all right ?
let me draw some blood .
some others are sick , too .
others ?
half breeds .
those like me .
i do see some foreign structures here , but none of it' s viral .
if i didn' t know better , i' d say it was just pollen .
it is pollen .
and some dust particles , too ... very common in the bloodstream .
nothing that should make you this sick .
antihistamines should stabilize you .
should clear it up .
are the others the same way ?
yes ... sore throat , skin rash , and no explanation .
you shouldn' t ... you shouldn' t be sick like this .
take me to it ... now !
professor ?
you wanted to see me ?
yeah .
i wanted to see you .
what happened to you ?
did you pull an all nighter ?
something like that .
i heard turner pulled the funding on your project .
yeah .
sorry .
thanks .
dean , i think i can help .
there' s something i want to show you .
go on in .
oh , shit .
take a closer look .
what the hell is this ?
i was hoping you could tell me .
i' ve never seen anything like it .
it' s definitely organic .
all right , where did this come from ?
it' s a half breed .
the result of some unfortunate coupling between human and alien dna .
its flawed genes made it vulnerable to common diseases .
as a result , they' re all a doomed species .
what' s more , they know it .
if this thing could track me down for help , we can only assume others will be coming , too .
possibly even more desperate and dangerous .
wait .
you' re not planning on just dissecting this , are you ?
no .
then what ?
something profound .
something that will assure my place in the pantheon of science .
yours , too , of course .
i' m talking about the engineering of a disease resistant , perfect alien species .
how ?
first , we cut up our friend , then we strip out the disease prone human dna and create a pure strain of alien nucleic acids .
all those aging mediocrities in the genetics community pinning awards on each other for sequencing dna .
sequencing it !
what good is it if you don' t do anything with it ?
even if you' ve got a pure strain , you' d still have to mate it with something , right ?
you' re getting the idea .
let' s get this thing out of here .
quietly ... and in pieces .
garbage bags in the cupboard .
i knew it .
so just what are we working on ?
oh !
oh , i' m terribly sorry .
i ...
i ...
i ...
excuse the intrusion .
i ...
i didn' t mean to interrupt .
i just came to see abbott .
he' s not home .
well , i' il come back another time .
would you like to come inside ?
why don' t you look at me ?
aren' t i attractive ?
you are by any standard ... perfect .
are you abbott' s girlfriend ?
housekeeper ?
just a friend .
just friends .
no need to use names .
your lack of inhibition is truly inspiring .
careful !
brooks brothers !
am i asleep ?
am i awake ?
who the hell cares ?
that' s enough .
you can leave .
excuse me ?
go !
shut the door on your way out .
not so fast .
moments like these don' t happen every day .
i think we should go for it .
no !
it' s not polite to be a prick tease !
don' t you know that ?
here .
let' s get inside .
what is that ?
it' s happened .
what' s happened ?
sara , where are you ?
what happened ?
sara , where are you ?
holy shit !
what the hell happened ?
what the hell was he doing here ?
lmpressive .
she' s already quite powerful .
what are you doing ?
here .
his access card might come in handy sometime .
no , no , just leave him .
we gotta call the police .
i don' t think so .
you don' t think so ?
there' s a dead man on your bedroom floor , professor !
turner had it coming for years now .
that' s crazy .
you' re not thinking about reporting this , are you ?
yeah !
it' s not murder .
she was just following instinct .
instinct ? !
listen , this whole situation has gotten way out of control .
we gotta call the police immediately .
do you really think the police are gonna believe you when you tell them an alien species killed the head of your department ?
if anything , they' il take a closer look at you , who recently had a very heated disagreement with the victim over your funding ... which he cut ?
that' s insane .
i need your help .
sara' s producing eggs now .
we can build something , something amazing .
you walk away now , it' s back to beakers and bunsen burners .
i like beakers and bunsen burners .
you' re upset , i know .
this part of it isn' t pleasant .
it' s in the name of science .
in the name of science ? !
you gotta give me something better than that !
the end result , the end result .
the outcome .
don' t ever lose sight of what that all will mean .
i want shared credit .
what ?
my name next to yours on everything we do .
agreed .
i was sure you' d turn that down .
what , and give you a graceful way out ?
truth is , you don' t want a way out .
not after what you' ve seen .
give me turner' s keys .
i' il get rid of the car .
easy .
easy .
come on .
now we gotta find sara .
how ?
you don' t even know what she looks like at this age .
no , no .
i' il know her when i see her .
she could be anywhere .
no , she' s close by .
it' s saturday night ... in a college town .
mating opportunities everywhere .
damn , baby !
all right , my turn .
i always wanted a girl who could kick my ass .
how about putting a little tongue on that ?
you don' t want the tongue .
she' s not here .
what if she doesn' t come back ?
she will .
how do you know ?
we' ve accepted her , provided her with food and shelter .
you look beat .
get some sleep .
thanks .
lent day .
dear , are you all right ?
honey , you must be freezing .
you got a name ?
i' m colleen .
come on , let me give you a ride home .
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
come on .
don' t feel bad .
there really aren' t any good men in the world .
so what do you do ?
sometimes , you settle for less .
other times , you curl up in bed with a book and a dove bar .
oh , i know .
i' m a huge sci fi geek .
all that roswell stuff ?
it' s real .
i' m going to a convention next month on government conspiracies .
i even know how to defend myself against alien abduction .
you do ?
oh , believe me .
we are living in a world of high strangeness .
turn here !
i thought you said ...
turn !
fine .
stop !
sweetie , there' s nothing out here .
what ...
where are you going ?
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
what , are you crazy ?
what are you doing running ?
what are you doing ?
oh , my god .
oh , no .
oh , my god .
god ...
oh , my god !
oh , god !
oh , god !
start !
start !
start !
okay , okay !
that' s it !
okay !
okay !
just go !
asshole .
wakey , wakey , sunshine .
what time is it ?
so what' s her name ?
who ?
whoever you were out with till 3 : 00 last night .
it was nobody .
where are you going ?
got to go to class .
on sunday ?
hello ?
listen , sorry i' m late .
my alarm clock didn' t go off .
hello ?
who are you ?
i' m dean .
you must be sara .
how do you know my name ?
because i' m working for abbott .
please let me go .
please .
you' re late .
again !
sorry .
i just met sara .
she' s friendly .
it' s better to stay away from her as much as you can .
no reason for you two to have any unnecessary interactions .
and another thing .
she' s not to be told what we' re doing down here , all right ?
as far as she knows , we' re just observing and studying her .
the half breed' s immune system is shredded .
lungs clogged with every imaginable toxin .
all of them will end up like this , i' d wager .
the same thing happen to sara ?
no , no , no .
her superior dna should keep her quite healthy .
let me bring you up to speed .
from project athena , using fitch' s files ,
i' ve done a comparative dna analysis of the three generations of alien species .
sil ... the original .
created with equal amounts human and alien dna .
it' s not a bad effort , really .
this , of course , is eve ... genetic duplicate of the original .
blood chemistry was highly toxic in both subjects .
behavior unpredictable , often aggressive .
disease free .
slightly susceptible to hydrochlorine solutions .
half breeds ... first life forms created naturally , outside the lab .
mother was human , father was an astronaut infected by the alien strain ... resulting in unstable offspring riddled with disease .
evolutionary mistakes with no defense against infection .
now we have perfection .
or close to it .
with a half human mother , sara still has traces of our dna , but she is the purest species yet .
no ...
i' m going out now .
don' t try to stop me .
have i stood in your way , sara ?
this is your home , not a prison .
we' re your friends .
do as you like .
you' re not just gonna let her go out ?
why not ?
what about secrecy ?
what about harvesting the eggs ?
that' s the plan , right ?
certainly .
anything could happen to her out there .
what if she doesn' t come back ?
she came back last night , didn' t she ?
sara has eliminated our species as potential partners .
as a purer strain , she has no genetic partner .
plainly put , the girl can' t get laid .
can you give me a hand ?
hey , you know this project athena ?
seems this guy , dr. fitch , already tried growing a creature from its own dna .
the thing nearly destroyed the isolation chamber before they incinerated it .
i have no intention of repeating dr. fitch' s failures .
obviously , pure alien dna is too volatile on its own .
once we inject it into sara' s eggs , though , her human chromosome should temper the mixture .
what about sara ?
how' s she gonna feel about this ?
sara doesn' t have any feelings .
let' s get on with this .
we have a lot to do .
may i help you ?
i need a room .
yes , sir .
please sign here .
something' s wrong .
nothing' s wrong .
there' s something wrong with you ... ... a sickness .
i' m fine .
you' re not fine !
you' re dying !
don' t turn your back on us !
hi .
sara , wait .
i wanted to show you something , if it' s all right .
why don' t you sit down ?
what is this ?
it' s chess .
it' s a game .
it' s fun .
this is the king , and it' s the most valuable piece , but it' s also the most vulnerable .
and there' s other pieces , and they all move .
that' s the rule book , but it' s long and boring .
it' s easier if i just show you .
start .
what ?
white moves first .
all right .
you' ve played before .
no .
wait , you don' t mean just by picking up that book , you could ...
that' s right .
you' re kidding , right ?
checkmate .
how can you do that ?
i have to sleep now .
okay ...
listen ... maybe we could , you know , sometime ...
what happened to your hand ?
it was a bunsen burner .
seen the departmental website today ?
amazing !
what about it ?
hi , my name' s amelia , and i am looking for anyone
in an accredited biochemistry program who' s recently done work in advanced dna electroporation .
jesus , look at her !
those eyes , man .
those bedroom eyes , man .
come on , she can' t look like that and be a biochemist .
who cares what she is ?
what are you doing ?
i gotta see just how crazy this chick is .
you' re an idiot .
dude , dude !
there' s already an answer .
hi .
this is amelia .
get out your credit card .
she' s definitely crazy ...
i' m in love .
before we speak directly .
i need to ask you a few questions .
have you done any unusual lab work in protoplastic cell suspension ?
specifically .
any kind of transmembrane conductivity and permeability diffusion ?
i' m looking for a man who has measured pore coefficients greater than 10e minus 16 meters squared per second .
if you' re that man .
please submit some sample data in the response body of an e mail to me .
if i like what you write .
we can meet .
i promise you won' t be disappointed .
okay ... that' s annoying .
turn your computer off .
just turn it off .
hey !
what' s your problem ? !
you' ve been acting squirrelly for days now ... sneaking around , disappearing .
what' s up ?
nothing .
sir , echelon picked this up during a morning sweep .
what is it ?
mass e mail .
went out to servers at every biochem program in north america .
the terminology is highly specialized .
certain key words resonate exactly with project athena .
athena .
wasn' t that shut down ?
i want this girl found .
yes , sir .
i' ve been meaning to tell you .
i think it' s a big mistake for you to start having feelings for sara .
feelings ?
she' s just gonna break your heart .
who said i had feelings for her ?
i understand the temptation , of course .
i don' t have feelings for her .
listen , i know she' s not attracted to humans , all right ?
everything she does is only in her own biological interest .
i know this .
and listen .
do me a favor .
i' il steal equipment , i' il dissect aliens , i' il even bury bodies .
just don' t give me any more dating advice .
please .
okay .
no one knows anything about this , right ?
of course not .
there you are .
we need to take another blood sample .
you know the drill .
you look tense .
and your blood pressure' s ... 140 .
... way up .
what' s wrong ?
i' d prefer it if dean took my blood .
dean ?
very well .
this won' t take long .
what the hell is that ? !
must be another half breed .
what are you doing ?
i equipped the lab with a fail safe .
hydrochloride gas .
but it' s toxic to sara , too !
come on , we gotta get her !
no !
stay !
what about the project ?
you can' t just let her die !
it' s already in here !
you already harvested her eggs ?
the first night of her maturity .
she never knew .
did it under anesthesia while she slept .
that' s why you let her go out .
oh , come on , look !
he' s raping her !
no , dean !
no !
damn it !
go !
go !
go !
go !
get sara !
go !
go !
go !
all right , listen to me .
listen to me , all right ?
you' re gonna be okay , all right ?
you' re gonna be okay !
i doubt it .
come on .
absurd ... can' t possibly end like this .
no , it' s not , okay ?
i' m gonna go to the e. r. come on !
i' m going to the e. r. right now !
come on !
the half breeds ... they' il keep coming .
more and more !
dangerous !
the eggs !
do it , dean ... create the new species .
do it ...
your life' s in danger .
i don' t understand .
you see that thing there ?
that contains your eggs .
alien ova , you understand ?
the half breeds need it so they can create a viable continuation of their line .
and abbott wanted it ...
abbott wanted it so he could create an even purer strain , so they' d give him the nobel prize .
i think we should just put an end to this whole little garden of eden right now .
what about me ?
sara , you could have a lifespan of 400 years , for all i know .
and if i don' t reproduce , the threat to your own species ends with me ?
that' s right .
but with the dna you' ve collected , you can create more like me .
sara , listen to me .
just because we can do something doesn' t mean we should .
i guess this is it , doctor .
ammonium nitrate and perchloric acid .
hope you' d approve .
sara , are you in here ?
we sh shouldn' t do this .
don' t you want me ?
yeah , of course i do , but ... why do you want me ?
i just do .
you' re not attracted to humans .
you want something .
abbott' s work was important .
the species must continue .
it' s up to you .
why don' t you just think of it as a simple exchange of services ?
fuck it .
i can' t .
it' s up to you , dean .
what' s up ?
did you hear about abbott ?
what about abbott ?
he' s gone , dude ... went missing .
just like dr. turner .
that' s two profs in one semester .
i wonder if there' s some kind of specialized serial killer out there .
so , anyway ... ... i heard back from amelia .
amelia ?
yeah .
the honey on the internet ?
the one who wanted the information on electroporation .
you got in touch with her ?
yeah .
she liked the data .
what data ?
something you wanna tell me ?
what are you talking about , hastings ?
you left your notebook here one day .
you went through my shit ?
jesus , man , why did you do that ? !
it' s genetically impossible !
so what the hell is it ?
look , i just ...
i can' t tell you right now , all right ?
i' m sorry .
she said the data was perfect .
and then she starts in with all kinds of other questions .
who was i ?
where did i get it ?
did i have any contact with alien life ?
at that point , i' m like , " all right , the chick really is crazy .
wait a minute .
she has your e mail address .
so ?
so she can find us !
so what , she' s just some harmless crazy chick !
right ?
what' il it be ?
this is a gas station , right ?
fill it up .
you sure you don' t need something else ?
yeah .
tell me where i can pee .
there' s a women' s room around the back .
check the oil , too ... unless that' s too hard for you .
nice ride .
got that right .
there' s no soap in here .
maybe you should file a complaint .
maybe you should get out of here .
maybe i should teach you some manners .
maybe you should .
come on .
all right .
jesus !
stop !
you' re goddamn killing me !
what do you say we join the party , huh ?
oh , shit !
yeah !
hell , yeah !
cobb ?
cobb , you okay ?
done worn him out .
i' m coming , i' m coming .
i' m amelia .
you must be hastings .
where can i go and freshen up ?
so , you want a drink or something ?
so ... how was your trip ?
where' s your lab ?
lab ?
i wanna see it .
i wanna see everything .
and after that , you' il get your reward .
you sure you don' t wanna ...
tell me something .
where did you get your specimen from , anyway ?
we never talked about that .
specimen ?
something wrong ?
no .
who else lives here ?
no one .
just me .
okay ... look ... you know it was all a joke ?
the data i sent you was fake .
i made it up .
you didn' t make up that data .
now why don' t you just tell me where you got it from ?
i told you .
i made it up .
it seems you haven' t been completely honest with me .
and from now on , that' s gonna change .
i came here to get something from you , and you are gonna give it to me .
trust me , you' re much better off making me happy than making me mad .
come on !
we gotta get out of the hallway !
stop !
stop !
we gotta get out of the hallway !
come on !
no !
oh , shit !
get in , dean .
it seems we still have a problem with project athena .
who are you ?
how do you know my name ?
what do they want ?
these things ?
why kidnap your roommate ?
i can' t be sure .
my best guess is that they need someone with scientific knowledge to help them bioengineer a new strain of species .
a new species ?
yeah .
' cause the current one' s about to go extinct .
and if they can' t get my help , they' il get my horny roommate to do it .
we can' t let ' em breed .
who' d you say you worked for ?
i didn' t .
look , we' ve been down this road before ... twice .
the two previous operations of containment resulted in a $700 million bill from the u. s. army and a six week investigation by congress .
i have neither the budget nor the stomach to go through that again .
besides , when i think of those operations , the word " overkill " comes to mind .
so you work for the government .
no , i' m a limousine driver .
unfortunately , the current administration has much less of an appetite for science fiction , shall we say ?
so i' m not here in an official capacity , and we won' t be taking care of this in an official capacity .
what are you gonna do ?
you and i are taking care of this in an unofficial capacity .
she' s probably found sara and brought hastings back to abbott' s lab .
all the equipment' s there for the dna cloning .
blazing in won' t do us any good .
we need to figure out a weakness on sara .
you can hack into abbott' s database , right ?
yeah , i think so .
good .
do it .
yes , sir .
have you made any progress yet ?
it' s confusing , all this stuff .
maybe it' s a question of focus .
now get on with it .
do you intend to kill him ?
so what if he dies ?
there' s a college campus here .
i can find another scientist .
what are you looking at ?
abbott made physiology schematics of the aliens .
we' re running out of time .
i know .
any weaknesses ?
the half breeds have failing immune systems , so we should be able to kill amelia with any common contaminant .
what kind of contaminant ?
hydrochlorine gas .
should produce a fatal infection .
that won' t work on sara .
how the hell are we gonna kill her ?
where do you think you' re going ?
this isn' t my problem .
look at me !
you might be fine now .
what about later ?
you' re our only hope .
it' s up to you now .
your ova cells look okay .
you can see on that monitor right there .
i should be able to inject the dna directly into it .
what happens after that ?
we' il have to grow it to maturity in a solution of carbon based molecules ... a membrane bag , basically .
once embryo growth has started , we just keep increasing the container size until it' s developed enough to breathe air .
go ahead .
what are you waiting for ?
please ... don' t make me do this .
do it .
what is that ?
they should be coming out soon .
this better work .
he' s got my eggs !
there he is .
hey , you okay ?
so ... how' s things ?
wonderful .
is this them ?
yeah , the dna and ova cells .
all right , we got the container .
they' il follow that .
who' s this guy ?
my driver .
dude , you' re right .
i shouldn' t have sent that e mail .
just get in .
hey !
hold it right there !
i' m gonna need some time !
give me the eggs !
listen , why don' t i just head on home ?
let' s go !
you' re with me !
this way !
warning .
containment door closing .
dr. turner .
access granted .
reload password .
containment door closed .
tokamak depressurizing .
christ .
it' s the eggs .
she' s following the eggs .
exactly .
that' s the plan .
let' s go !
she' s buying it .
where in the hell' s dean ?
he should be here !
take me to the control room .
up here !
warning .
tokamak depressurizing .
what are you guys up to , anyway ?
later .
the remote' s gone !
what ?
he' s taken control of the reactor .
it' s activated !
he' s lowering the pressure in the reactor room .
you better know what you' re doing , dean .
who' s in here ?
hold it right there !
don' t move !
what ?
something wrong with my face ?
one last thing .
warning .
tokamak depressurizing .
he' s powering down the magnets !
just stick to the plan , dean .
this thing' s gonna blow !
what are you talking about ?
this was not part of the plan !
close the shaft , dean .
why ?
if he doesn' t secure the shaft , the explosion will release into the atmosphere , taking all of us with it !
what ?
damn it , dean , close down the shaft !
warning .
magnetic failure .
now !
now !
now !
close the fucking shaft , dean !
magnetic ...
oh , shit !
sara , no !
oh , shit !
hold on !
i think it' s over .
containment door secured .
magnets repowering .
i guess he closed the shaft .
yeah .
let' s go find dean !
come on !
let' s go !
we' re still trying to understand the cause of the explosion .
the experimental reactor was located deep inside this power plant .
the access records show that a man named dr. nicholas turner was using the system at the time of the blast .
if he suvived it .
we' d cetainly like to talk to him .
you' re awake !
yeah .
how ya feeling ?
not bad .
doc says you' re gonna be okay .
yeah .
oh , i brought your favorite dirty magazine .
did you see wasach on tv ?
yeah ... said you should come see him sometime in washington when you' re feeling better .
really ?
it' s all cool .
turner' s taking the rap .
he even thanked us on behalf of the government .
listen , man , about this whole thing ...
i' m sorry .
i' m hungry .
you hungry ?
yeah , sure .
no .
oh , no .
what are you ...
what' s up ?
what the hell is going on here ?
i' m just doing a little cleanup .
no , i mean upstairs !
there' s ...
oh , christ .
all right , just relax .
there' s something i haven' t told you .
come on !
you said it was over .
it is over .
she' s got what she wants now .
what she ...
what did you do ?
there was still some remnants of the half breed dna , so i stripped away the damaging human strains and created him .
you see , abbott' s mistake was relying on sara' s eggs .
after all , she couldn' t mate with anything that was from her own genetic material .
so i created another one , solely from the other dna .
it' s two separate lines .
well , you' re on your own now , so ... be careful .
sara , wait .
that night on the catwalk , you saved my life , but your eggs were already gone .
you had no more use for me .
why' d you do it ?
maybe you' il find the answer to that someday .
well , that' s just great .
we go through all that , and in the end , you give her a goddamn boyfriend .
nobody should be alone , man .
you' ve just sentenced the world to destruction , my friend .
you realize once those two start mating ...
i didn' t say he was fertile , did i ?
you mean , you made him ...
sterile .
i tweaked the chromosomes before i even started .
what happens once they figure out he' s sterile ?
they might not take too kindly to that .
i don' t know .
come on , i' il buy you breakfast .
it' s my turn , anyway .
