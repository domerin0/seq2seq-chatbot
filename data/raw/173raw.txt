i don' t know why he' s so upset .
it' s only a couple of carrots .
and some cabbages .
and those three bags of potatoes that we lifted last week .
and then the mushrooms the week before .
yes , pippin .
my point is ... ... he' s clearly overreacting .

i think i' ve broken something .

that was just a detour .
a short cut .
short cut to what ?
mushrooms !

i think we should get off the road .
get off the road !

or someone .

the brandywine bridge .
20 miles .
come on .
what do you want ?
we' re heading for the prancing pony .
hobbits .
four hobbits !
what' s more , out of the shire by your talk .
what business brings you to bree ?
we wish to stay at the inn .
our business is our own .
all right , young sir .
i meant no offense .
it' s my job to ask questions after nightfall .
there' s talk of strange folk abroad .
can' t be too careful .
out of the way !
watch where you' re waking .
excuse me .
good evening , little masters .
what can i do for you ?
if you' re seeking accommodation , we got some cozy hobbit sized rooms available .
always proud to cater to the little folk , mister ... ?
underhill .
my name' s underhill .
underhill , yes .
we' re friends of gandalf the grey .
can you tell him we' ve arrived ?
gandalf ?
gandalf .
oh , yes ... ... i remember .
elderly chap .
big grey beard , pointy hat .
not seen him for six months .
what do we do now ?
sam ... ... he' il be here .
he' il come .
get out of my way !
what' s that ?
this , my friend , is a pint .
it comes in pints ?
i' m getting one .
you got a whole half already !
that fellow' s done nothing but stare at you since we arrived .
excuse me .
that man in the corner .
who is he ?
he' s one of them rangers .
they' re dangerous folk , wandering the wilds .
what his right name is , i' ve never heard , but around here he' s known as strider .
strider .
baggins .
baggins .
baggins ?
sure , i know a baggins .
he' s over there .
frodo baggins .
he' s my second cousin , once removed on his mother' s side ... ... and my third cousin , twice removed ....
pippin !
steady on , frodo .
you cannot hide .
i see you .
there is no life ... ... in the void .
only ... ... death .
you draw far too much attention to yourself , mr. underhill .
what do you want ?
a little more caution from you .
that is no trinket you carry .
i carry nothing .
indeed .
i can avoid being seen if i wish ... ... but to disappear entirely , that is a rare gift .
who are you ?
are you frightened ?
yes .
not nearly frightened enough .
i know what hunts you .
let him go !
or i' il have you , longshanks .
you have a stout heart , little hobbit .
but that will not save you .
you can no longer wait for the wizard , frodo .
they' re coming .
what are they ?
they were once men .
great kings of men .
then sauron the deceiver gave to them nine rings of power .
blinded by their greed , they took them without question .
one by one , falling into darkness .
now they are slaves to his will .
they are the nazgul .
ringwraiths .
neither living nor dead .
at all times they feel ... ... the presence of the ring ... ... drawn to the power of the one .
they will never stop hunting you .
where are you taking us ?
into the wild .
how do we know this strider is a friend of gandalf ?
i think a servant of the enemy would look fairer ...
... and feel fouler .
he' s foul enough .
we have no choice but to trust him .
but where is he leading us ?
to rivendell , master gamgee .
to the house of elrond .
did you hear that ?
rivendell .
we' re going to see the elves .
gentlemen , we do not stop till nightfall .
what about breakfast ?
you' ve already had it .
we' ve had one , yes .
what about second breakfast ?
don' t think he knows about second breakfast , pip .
what about elevenses ?
luncheon ?
afternoon tea ?
dinner ?
supper ?
he knows about them , doesn' t he ?
i wouldn t count on it .
pippin !
what do they eat when they can' t get hobbit ?
who is she ?
this woman you sing of .
' tis the lady of luthien .
the elf maiden who gave her love to beren , a mortal .
what happened to her ?
she died .
get some sleep , frodo .
the power of isengard is at your command ... ...
sauron , lord of the earth .
build me an army worthy of mordor .
what orders from mordor , my lord ?
what does the eye command ?
we have work to do .
the trees are strong , my lord .
their roots go deep .
rip them all down .
this was the great watchtower of amon sul .
we shall rest here tonight .
these are for you .
keep them close .
i' m going to have a look around .
stay here .
my tomato' s burst .
could i have some bacon ?
want a tomato , sam ?
what are you doing ? !
tomatoes , sausages , nice crispy bacon .
we saved some for you , mr. frodo .
put it out , you fools !
put it out !
that' s nice !
ash on my tomatoes !
go !
back , you devils !
frodo !
oh , sam .
strider !
help him , strider .
he' s been stabbed by a morgul blade .
this is beyond my skill to heal .
he needs elvish medicine .
hurry !
we' re six days from rivendell !
he' il never make it !
hold on , frodo .
gandalf !
look , frodo .
it' s mr. bilbo' s trolls .
mr. frodo ?
he' s going cold .
is he going to die ?
he' s passing into the shadow world .
he' il soon become a wraith like them .
they' re close .
sam , do you know the athelas plant ?
athelas ?
kingsfoil .
kingsfoil , aye , it' s a weed .
it may help to slow the poisoning .
hurry !
what' s this ?
a ranger caught off his guard ?
frodo .
who is she ?
frodo .
she' s an elf .
he' s fading .
he' s not going to last .
we must get him to my father .
i' ve been looking for you for two days .
where are you taking him ?
there are five wraiths behind you .
where the other four are , i do not know .
what are they saying ?
i do not fear them .
arwen ... ... ride hard .
don' t look back .
what are you doing ? !
those wraiths are still out there !
give up the halfling , she elf .
if you want him , come and claim him .
no .
no !
frodo , no .
frodo , don' t give in .
not now .
what grace is given me ... ... let it pass to him .
let him be spared .
save him .
where am i ?
you are in the house of elrond .
and it is 1 0 : 00 in the morning on october 24th , if you want to know .
gandalf !
yes , i' m here .
and you' re lucky to be here too .
a few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid .
but you have some strength in you , my dear hobbit .
what happened , gandalf ?
why didn' t you meet us ?
i am sorry , frodo .
i was delayed .
a friendship with saruman is not lightly thrown aside .
one ill turn deserves another .
it is over .
embrace the power of the ring ... ... or embrace your own destruction !
there is only one lord of the ring .
only one who can bend it to his will .
and he does not share power .
so you have chosen death .
gandalf ?
what is it ?
nothing , frodo .
frodo !
sam .
bless you , you' re awake !
sam has hardly left your side .
we were that worried about you .
weren' t we , mr. gandalf ?
by the skills of lord elrond , you' re beginning to mend .
welcome to rivendell , frodo baggins .
bilbo !
hello , frodo , my lad .
bilbo .
a hobbit' s tale , by bilbo baggins .
this is wonderful .
i meant to go back ... ... wonder at the powers of mirkwood ... ... visit lake town ... ... see the lonely mountain again .
but age , it seems , has finally caught up with me .
i miss the shire .
i spent all my childhood pretending i was off somewhere else .
off with you , on one of your adventures .
but my own adventure turned out to be quite different .
i' m not like you , bilbo .
my dear boy .
now , what have i forgotten ?
packed already ?
no harm in being prepared .
i thought you wanted to see the elves .
i do .
more than anything .
i did .
it' s just ....
we did what gandalf wanted , didn' t we ?
we got the ring this far , to rivendell .
and i thought ... ... seeing as how you' re on the mend , we' d be off soon .
off home .
you are right , sam .
we did what we set out to do .
the ring will be safe in rivendell .
i am ready to go home .
his strength returns .
that wound will never fully heal .
he will carry it the rest of his life .
and yet to have come so far still bearing the ring ... ... the hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil .
it is a burden he should never have had to bear .
we can ask no more of frodo .
gandalf , the enemy is moving .
sauron' s forces are massing in the east .
his eye is fixed on rivendell .
and saruman , you tell me , has betrayed us .
our list of allies grows thin .
his treachery runs deeper than you know .
by foul craft , saruman has crossed orcs with goblin men .
he' s breeding an army in the caverns of isengard .
an army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed .
saruman is coming for the ring .
this evil cannot be concealed by the power of the elves .
we do not have the strength to fight both mordor and isengard !
gandalf ... ... the ring cannot stay here .
this peril belongs to all middle earth .
they must decide now how to end it .
the time of the elves is over .
my people are leaving these shores .
who will you look to when we' ve gone ?
the dwarves ?
they hide in mountains seeking riches .
they care not for the troubles of others .
it is in men that we must place our hope .
men ?
men are weak .
the race of men is failing .
the blood of numenor is all but spent , its pride and dignity forgotten .
it is because of men the ring survives .
i was there , gandalf .
i was there 3000 years ago ...
... when isildur took the ring .
i was there the day the strength of men failed .
isildur , hurry !
follow me .
i led isildur into the heart of mount doom ... ... where the ring was forged , the one place it could be destroyed .
cast it into the fire !
destroy it !
no .
isildur !
it should have ended that day , but evil was allowed to endure .
isildur kept the ring .
the line of kings is broken .
there' s no strength left in the world of men .
they' re scattered , divided , leaderless .
there is one who could unite them .
one who could reclaim the throne of gondor .
he turned from that path a long time ago .
he has chosen exile .
you are no elf .
men of the south are welcome here .
who are you ?
i am a friend to gandalf the grey .
then we are here on common purpose ... ... friend .
the shards of narsil .
the blade that cut the ring from sauron' s hand .
it' s still sharp .
but no more than a broken heirloom .
why do you fear the past ?
you are isildur' s heir , not isildur himself .
you are not bound to his fate .
the same blood flows in my veins .
the same weakness .
your time will come .
you will face the same evil .
and you will defeat it .
you said you' d bind yourself to me ... ... forsaking the immortal life of your people .
and to that i hold .
i would rather share one lifetime with you ... ... than face all the ages of this world alone .
i choose a mortal life .
you cannot give me this .
it is mine to give to whom i will ...
... like my heart .
strangers from distant lands , friends of old ... ... you' ve been summoned here to answer the threat of mordor .
middle earth stands upon the brink of destruction .
none can escape it .
you will unite , or you will fall .
each race is bound to this fate , this one doom .
bring forth the ring , frodo .
so it is true .
in a dream ... ... i saw the eastern sky grow dark ... ... but in the west a pale light lingered .
a voice was crying : your doom is near at hand .
isildur' s bane is found .
isildur s bane .
boromir !
never before has any voice uttered the words of that tongue here in imladris .
i do not ask your pardon , master elrond ... ... for the black speech of mordor ... ... may yet be heard ... ... in every corner of the west !
the ring is altogether evil .
it is a gift .
a gift to the foes of mordor .
why not use this ring ?
long has my father , the steward of gondor ... ... kept the forces of mordor at bay .
by the blood of our people ... ... are your lands kept safe .
give gondor the weapon of the enemy .
let us use it against him .
you cannot wield it .
none of us can .
the one ring answers to sauron alone .
it has no other master .
and what would a ranger know of this matter ?
this is no mere ranger .
he is aragorn , son of arathorn .
you owe him your allegiance .
aragorn .
this is isildur s heir ?
and heir to the throne of gondor .
gondor has no king .
gondor needs no king .
aragorn is right .
we cannot use it .
you have only one choice .
the ring must be destroyed .
what are we waiting for ?
the ring cannot be destroyed , gimli , son of gloin ... ... by any craft that we here possess .
the ring was made in the fires of mount doom .
only there can it be unmade .
it must be taken deep into mordor ... ... and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came .
one of you ... ... must do this .
one does not simply walk into mordor .
its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs .
there is evil there that does not sleep .
the great eye is ever watchful .
it is a barren wasteland ... ... riddled with fire , and ash and dust .
the very air you breathe is a poisonous fume .
not with 1 0, 000 men could you do this .
it is folly .
have you heard nothing lord elrond has said ?
the ring must be destroyed .
and i suppose you think you are the one to do it !
and if we fail , what then ?
what happens when sauron takes back what is his ?
i will be dead before i see the ring in the hands of an elf !
never trust an elf !
do you not understand ?
while you bicker amongst yourselves , sauron' s power grows !
none can escape it !
you' il all be destroyed !
i will take it .
i will take it .
i will take the ring to mordor .
though ... ... i do not know the way .
i will help you bear this burden , frodo baggins ... ... as long as it is yours to bear .
if by my life or death i can protect you ... ... i will .
you have my sword .
and you have my bow .
and my ax .
you carry the fates of us all , little one .
if this is indeed the will of the council ... ... then gondor will see it done .
frodo' s not going anywhere without me .
it is hardly possible to separate you ... ... even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not .
we' re coming too !
you' il have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us .
anyway , you need people of intelligence on this sort of ... ... mission .
quest .
thing .
well , that rules you out , pip .
nine companions .
so be it .
you shall be the fellowship of the ring .
great !
where are we going ?
