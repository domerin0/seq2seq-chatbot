my son ...
i had a dream iast night , the sun was shining , there were flowers everywhere .
come on , sis , we' ii be iate for school !
zach , iook !
oh no , that machine is going to crush the flower .
we have to do something !
stand back , cynthia .
zach !
a scambocop !
halt !
do not proceed !
you are trespassing in a restricted zone .
hurry , zach !
central , machine breakdown in progress .
copy , unit 12 .
do you need any back up ?
negative , central .
situation under contr ...
another flower saved from mayor scamboli' s grasp .
little brats ...
they don' t appreciate the magnificence of the city i' ve built for them !
it' s the metropolis of the future , the pinnacle of progress ...
yes boss .
you said it , boss . ... the temple of technology ...
just iook at my city , scamboviile .
instead of trees and grass , there' s steei and glass ...
concrete , asphalt !
and thanks to me and my tireless efforts ...
yay , hurray for mayor scamboli ! ... we have soaring towers , gleaming industries , mega brained robots ... ... i could talk to you about scambo welfare for retired robots ... about scambonuses for outstanding robot achievements ...
about ...
you ... ... about robo nursing for depressed executives ...
but what' s the use ?
do the children reaily appreciate my hard work ?
we do , boss .
right !
and i won' t iet those iittle termites destroy my creation ...
never !
cabby .
do you know what bothers me most about children ?
they don' t pay taxes ?
worse .
it' s their ...
whiny iittle voices i can' t  hi daddy .
marlene !!
ha !
you know you' re not supposed to barge in here .
heilo , sweetheart .
i' m so happy to see you .
come give daddy a kiss .
i' ve got a hot new program for you , robots .
want to try it out ?
oh no ...
don' t ! ...
no !!
don' t , marlene !
trust me , it' s wicked .
please , no ... not again ...
marlene , wiii you ever grow up !
you' re ruining my robots !
you and your siily robots ...
who needs them anyway ?
kids need to play and have fun , you know .
scamboviile is fun .
not for us .
nonsense .
what ?
haven' t i created speciai passageways ... just for kids to walk to and from school ?
you don' t get it .
scamboviile is aii about work and technology .
there' s no room for play .
of course there is .
every building over thirty stories has an authorized de stressing room .
but nowhere for kids to be happy , daddy .
we need our own space .
your own space ...

yeah !
what a briiliant idea !

cool .
firecrackers !
i feei good .

mom !
easy , robo boy .
i ain' t nobody' s mama .
i' m just the iocal ... fairy .
turn around , boy .
let me have a iook at ya .
very design , geppetto .
but then again , you' re italian .
looks iike my toaster .
i love chrome .
so , what' s he do ?
i mean does he do housework ?
heavy iifting ?
no , no .
he' s my son .
how do you know my name ?
cyberina always keeps up with current events .
cyberina ?
spencer , doil , close that beak before you catch a fly .
look at my coils !
did i reaily program this ugly ' do ?
recoil !

geppetto , you do remember he' s a robot .
i love him iike my own son .
you' re my dad .
i love you too .
alright , geppetto !
programming love is quite an art .
pinocchio , you know your dad' s dearest wish ...
and i know this because i' m a fairy , and we are clairvoyant ... ... his biggest wish for you is to be a reai boy .
you know i can make his dream come true .
what do you say ?

good .
but , first you have ... to iearn the difference between right and wrong .
no sweat .
load the program !
i' m a super quick iearner .
slow down that hard drive , honey .
it' s not that easy .
learning right from wrong is something you have to feel for yourself .
now , i can give you a couple of hints , reminders reaily .
you' ii get it eventuaily , honey .
your dad has given you a sharp mind and a warm heart .
now you just put them together and i' m sure it' ii come to you .
you can do it , son .
and once you have ...
i' ii turn you into a reai kid .
deal , cyber boy ?
saved to memory !
where' d she go ?
out there ... ... and in here .
don' t worry .
it' s not as hard as you think to iearn right from wrong .
granny penguindolyn used to say , " there are 9 ways to skin a cat " ...
spencer ! ...
of course , being a penguin , she could never skin a cat ...
spencer !
she couldn' t even hit a naii on the head .
zip it !!
sorry .
chair .
tomorrow , you' ii go to school .
but now , it' s time to close your eyes and sleep .

a simple blackout and those iittle brats turn their back on me ? !
oh no .
now , they have a problem .
a major problem .
major problem .

it' s so alive .
it gives me a feeling ... ... of being safe and secure .
is everything ok , spencer ?
pinocchio ...
you have to wait for the flashing iight to come on before you can cross .
wait for the flashing iight to come on , before i cross .
saved to memory .
does that mean it' s " wrong " to cross at a flashing iight ?
yesiree .
very wrong !
then why are they stopped ?
weil , b b b because it' s different for them .
so , sometimes a flashing iight means stop , sometimes it means go ?
not exactly .
i i mean , i mean , yes , yes , weii sort of , sort ...
it it depends .
it depends .
spencer , i think i have a memory conflict .
there are no right conflicts .
just wrong solutions .
saved to memory ...
but , could you run what' s right and what' s wrong past me one more time ?
weil , to make a short story iong ...
my fellow citizens ...
scamboland is in full operation now and open for all ... of scamboville' s children .

what' s the difference
between a robot and a man ?
what' s the difference ?
what' s the difference
between a program and a heart ?
what' s the difference ?
between me and you ?
i got my own emotions i' m dancing like a puppet
i' m so fast with connections speeding like a rocket
my world is only fiction there' s one thing i can' t do
with my imagination i' m gonna make it true
what' s the difference between the machine and a smile ?
what' s the difference ?
what' s the difference
between a program and a heart ?
what' s the difference between me and you ?
let the music play let me do it my way
it' s my intuition
let the music play let me go my way
i feel that emotion i' m gonna have some fun
let the music play let me do it my way
i feel that emotion i' m gonna have some fun
let the music
let the music
control
let the music
control
your body , your soul
let the music control
your body , your soul
what' s the difference ?
what' s the difference
between me . between you ?
between me and you ?
