i just happen to have my labeller .
it is so hard to get rid of the things .
did you and chandler have to make compromises ? when did you first moved in together ?
chandler did .
what does he want you to give up ?
a bunch of stuff .
and the worse ... he wants me to get rid of gladys .
who is gladys ?
what a tragic loss !
yeah , i really hate to give her up .
oh i know !
you should take her !
me ...
i don' t know ...
what , don' t you like her ?
of course i do .
why would i not like her ?
i' il take her in a minute .
i think that your giving up too easy honey ,
i think that you should fight for her .
really ?
do you think ?
absolutely !
yeah , you tell him " i am sorry mike
i cannot live without her , she means too much for me .
ok , i will fight for her .
ok .
oh wait , i have just realized that if i do that ,
that means that you won' t get her .
damn it , i did not think this through !
hello .
any word on casting yet ?
joey , i already told to you that you' re not right for the part !
what do you want mean ?
rachel , don' t i seem like the professor that you would buy a kind of e crap from ?
sorry , this sounds like something that i' d never be interested in .
come on , please , it is not like i' m asking you for some crazy favor .
this is what i do for a living !
i am a professional actor .
oh man , i am 2 hours late for work .
this is a copy of all the commercials i' ve been in !
joe ...
look just watch it , if you don' t like it , don' t pass it to your bosses !
fine .
thank you .
work joe .
shit !
what am i going to do now ?
just pass the tape along !
but he' s not right for the part .
if i suggest him , my bosses are going to think i' m an idiot .
and that is something that they should learn on their own .
tell joey that you watched the tape and that you liked it but your bosses did' nt !
that way you are the good guy , and they are the bad guys .
that' s good .
i liked it , they did' nt .
joey , for god' s sake , go to work !
i cannot believe that i am about to meet benjamin hobart .
i always thought about him as one of the guests i' d invite to my imaginary dinner party .
you think that there is any chance he' d bring christy brinkley or c3po ?
sorry .
i believe that that is just him .
charlie !
my god !
you look absolutely stuning !

well , yes and no .
yes , i did say it .

i am sorry .
it is just that i have' nt seen her for so long .
and all these feelings are coming back to me .
i am starting to realise how much i missed her and i need you to break up with her .
are you serious ?
if you say yes , then i am serious .
if you say no , then i' m joking .

wait , wait just a minute .
none of my questions have anything to do with paleontology .
you are right .
i apologize .
let' s forget the last question .

i am insulted .
when i tell someone that i ...
let me stop you right there .
first , you lied .
then , you lied about lying .

then before lying about the lie , of the lie , of the lie ... of your lie ...
stop lying !
why are you so sure that i didn' t watch this tape ?
do you want to know ?
do you want to know why ?
this is going well !
here is why i know that you didn' t watch the tape !

ichiban
lipstick for men
ichiban
lipstick for men
saiko
and that is how i know that you didn' t watch the tape !
he really is a chameleon .
well ...
gladys , say hello in your new home !
oh my ... she is so nice and big !
oh monica , where are you going to display gladys so proudly ?
we have' nt really settled on a spot yet .
hey !
why not just above the television ? that way , it will be the first thing you see when you walk in through the door !
yeah !
yeah , and you will get rid of that french poster .
i like that poster .
really ?
it does' nt have anything coming out from it .
or maybe there is some place for it in your bedroom .
oh !
there is noting above your bed !
are you still here ?
oh , hello .
have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions ?
your grandmother' s nickname , perhaps ?
and ann margaret' s pants size ?
i' ve come here to apologize .
i think i may have let my feelings for charlie interfere in the interview process .
no .
stop .
any way i have decided to offer you the grant .
really ?
well , there is just one small ... stipulation .
i have to break up with charlie ?
you got one right !
you are crazy .
crazy or ... romantic ?
crazy !
or ... ?
get out !
oh my god !
what ?
joey , what is this thing doing here ?
i got it from monica . she sold it to me for a very reasonable price .
joey , we are not keeping this .
but it is an original buffay .
allright , fine .
you can keep it .
as long as you don' t mind that she is haunted .
what , what ?
oh , what , what ?
hey well , the legend says , joey , that she comes a live when you are asleep .
she climb out of the frame and she drags her half body across the floor ,
looking for legs to steal .
and then , with her one good hand , she slowly reaches up , and turns your doorknob ...
get that legs less witch out of here !
hey , i sold that to joey !
hey well , i told to him that she was haunted .
two can play at this game .
no , too late .
you cannot give it back .
yes i can .
no you cannot , she' s yours .
she' s yours ! she is yours !
she is yours ! she is mine ! she is mine !
she is mine !
she is mine !
girls , girls .
you do not have to fight over her anymore .
whoever does not get gladys get' s gwyneth .
i want gladys ! she is mine ! she is mine !
to me !
to me !
look , i am sorry .
i didn' t give them your tape . and i promise next time , to submit you .... whether i think you right for the part or not .
there is not the point , chandler .
the point is that you lied .
i know .
you are right .
what is it going to take for you to forgive me ?
oh my god !
excellent .
now what do you say ?
lying is wrong .
and ?
and ?
i am a pretty little girl .
i knew it .
your ex boyfriend is insane .
did you get the grant ?
no .
and do you want to know why ?
because your ex boyfriend is still in love with you .
what ?
yeah .
he would' nt give me the grant because i didn' t want to give you up .
benji is not in love with me .
i mean , he broke up with me .
and besides he is a really ethical man
really ?
is this ethical to ask someone at a grant review ... who was the voice of " underdog ?
i am sure he was just joking , ross .
if you don' t believe me , lets go talk to him okay ?
i' m telling you .
he didn' t ask me one paleontology question .
seriously ?
no , i am sorry .
no , he did ask me one .
how do you spell " boscodictiasaure ?
if it is like lake bosco in congo , then m ...
damn it !
doctor geller ?
charlie .
what are you doing here ... ?
i want that you to tell her everything about the deal you tried to make with me , about the crazy questions that you ...
wally cox !
that is the voice of " underdog " .
like i tried to tell you at the time of the interview , ross , this grant is not based on your knowledge of useless trivia .
no , no , no .
don' t do that .
i want you to look her in the eyes and tell her the truth .
benji ?
allright , it is true .
i behaved horribly but it is only because i still love you .
and i would do anything to have you back in my life .
too little too late benji !
i cannot believe this .
i should never have broken up with you .
i think about you all the time .
i mean , do you ever still think about me ?
no .
yes .
what ?
i don' t know what to say benji .
this is all so ... romantic .
or ... ?
listen .
i know that i may be way out of bounds here , but is there any chance that you would take me back ?
maybe .
sweetie .
this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable .
oh god .
i am so sorry .
but ...
i mean ... there is so much history between us , do you know ?
i am sorry too .
i love you .
i love you too !
okay , that is it ...
we are seeing other people !
gladys ?
third time this week !
this does not get old .
you are mean !
don' t be such a baby .
