who cares , anyhow ?
not me .
wow !
you must think i' m some cheap date .
no , sir .
i don' t know how you city folks work .

you do make that cigarette look good .
you make that dress look good .
you' re so sweet .
do i owe you anything ?

it' il always be something with you , mike .

fuck him .
how you doing ?
where is the pisser ?
nice place you got here .
a real shit hole .
gus , give me a hand .
oh , yeah .
that' s a lot of money .
$3 . 2 million . $3 . 2 million ?
that' s a beautiful thing .
less jack' s 10 percent .
right .
damn .
that' s a lot of money just to fly a helicopter .
would you rather we used a hot air balloon ?
no .
or maybe hang gliders ?
would you rather we used hang gliders ?
i don' t know what a hang glider is .
i doubt you know how to fly a fucking helicopter , either .
if you ask me , $320, 000 is well worth it .
besides , jack has taken care of a lot of shit ... ... you don' t know anything about .
all right .
back to business .
where is franklin' s pile ?
what are you talking about ?
franklin .
anybody remember him ?
i was there .
franklin is dead .
right .
so , where is franklin' s pile ?
well , murph , we don' t make him a pile .
we split up four ways .
wrong .
franklin' s pile does not get split up .
sure , i' m good with that .
bullshit !
who gets the remaining 15 percent , then ?
let me guess .
it was my deal , hanson .
no , i want that 15 percent split up four ways .
you want ?
yeah , i want .
well , i could give a flying fuck what you want .
a deal is a deal .
let me put it this way .
that fucking deal died with franklin .
now , it' s time to make a new deal .
that' s a commitment , hanson .
i' il give you that .
fuck it .
we shot everybody in the casino , let' s start shooting each other .
come on , you guys , let' s just settle down , all right ?
we don' t need this .
gus is right .
let' s just keep this simple .
i' il take my 15 percent , plus 25 percent of franklin' s end , and i' il take it now .
i' m not letting that happen .
why the hell not ?
because that would change the plan , and when plans change ... ... things get fucked up !
you' il have to learn to be more flexible .
the plan stays !
we have an arrangement in twin falls ... ... where we' il get 70 cents on the dollar .
we' il keep that arrangement .
all of us .
after that , i' m over the border into canada and you can all get on michael' s boat ... ... for all i care .
no .
nobody gets on my boat but me .
right .
whatever .
if anyone goes before then , there' s a chance you' il spend the money .
you spend the money , you' il get popped .
and the chances are you' il talk .
either way , i' m not taking that chance .
murph , i' ve been doing this a long time and i' ve never dropped dime on anybody .
want to keep blowing smoke in my face , or you want me to blow your head off ?
you go do whatever it is you got to do in twin falls or wherever .
that' s your criminal right .
me , i' m staying right here .
you both have hot sheets .
instead of traveling with you ... ... l should be putting as much distance from you as humanly possible .
traveling with you fucks is the weakest part of the plan .
but since we don' t trust each other , we' il travel north together as a group .
so , try to think of us as the osmonds , only we don' t fucking get along .
gentlemen , as far as i' m concerned , this job is done .
i' m cashing out .
just give me my fucking money .
is that an order ?
no , come on , that wasn' t an order .
i mean , technically it wasn' t .
what about you , gus ?
what ?
you think this is your fucking money ?
no , no .
this is my money .
that' s your money .
michael .
i just want to get on the move , murph .
makes you the only fucking pig in the room , hanson .
you make me laugh , you know ?
i can' t imagine what goes through that sick mind of yours .
sometimes i actually think you believe you' re the king himself .
what is it with those side burns ?
i glued mine on for the job .
for you , it' s an actual lifestyle choice .
shut up .
i' m serious !
shut up .
it' s fucking sad , man .
nevertheless , i do know the golden rule .
and what' s that , sweetheart ?
fuck the gold .
he who has the nickel plating ... ... makes the rules .
you shot him !
that' s right , gus .
now , i' m going to kill him .
sweetheart .
wrap him up .
wrap him up .
wrap him up !
fuck !
anybody ?
no .
we need some towels !
he' s bleeding all over the place .
hey , murph .
how are we going to split up the money now ?
hey , this boy is heavy .
i think he had one too many peanut butter and fried banana sandwiches .
god !
need a ride , fella ?
thanks .
fuck !
a raidas wild and as daring as anything seen on the american landscape .
the riviera hoteland casino exploded today in a shower of gunfire ... ... during the international elvis convention .
where' s jesse ?

that' s $100, 000 in there .
just for you to keep your mouth shut .
you don' t have to pay me off , i won' t tell anybody .
no , you' re not .
all i need is a couple of days .
after that , you can do whatever the hell you want .
everything is understood ?
i got it .
well .
hey , elvis .
is there any chance that i might be able to see you again ?
sorry , cybil .
are you 100 percent sure of that ?
yeah , 100, 000 percent .
i need your car .
what ?
yeah , the old valiant out there .
where are the keys ?
i' m not giving that to you .
yeah , you are .
because i just gave you $100, 000 for it .
i don' t care how much you just gave me .
anyway , it' s not my car .
it' s my grandmother' s .
you either give me the keys right now  or what ?
you' re going to kill us ?
you know , there is a simple solution here .
yeah , there is .
you can take us with you .
what ?
why not ?
where are you going ?
i haven' t got time for this .
you got three seconds to get me those keys ... ... or i' il splatter cherry pie on that wall behind you and ... ... l' m dead serious about that .
one , two ....
stop pointing that gun at my mom .
who' s there ?
it' s the police .
can you open the door , please ?
mom , money !
sit down .
sit down !
mom , get the door .
can i help you ?
evening .
we received an emergency 91 1 call from this room .
are you sure ?
yeah .
the call was disconnected .
we were in the neighborhood .
everything okay ?
yeah , it' s fine .
we were just fixing to leave .
can we come in , ma' am ?
of course you can . ... elvis impersonators made it up the elevator and to the roof where they were ... ... taken by helicopter , we don' t know where .
are you the man of the house ?
we just got engaged .
congratulations .
thank you .
we' re really excited about it .
we' re about to go on a trip to the grand canyon .
jesse , why don' t you go get your stuff ?
okay .
well , i' il be right back .
so , which of you is the one who dialed 91 1 ?
i' m sorry .
i was trying to dial 41 1 for information and i dialed 9 by mistake .
well , i guess we' re all set here .
we' il be on our way .
so are we .
come on .
ma' am , can i give you a hand with your bag ?
if you wouldn' t mind .
it' s really heavy .
we got a lot of schoolbooks .
it would be my pleasure .
we' il be right there .
come on .
bye bye !
you guys are federal marshals ?
if we' re not , we' d better give these fuckers back .
good morning .
not for them it isn' t .
' morning .
vegas homicide .
what do you got , vegas ?
no ids .
looks like this one was digging , trying to bury the one in the sheet .
someone drilled them from the front .
double taps to the heart .
three spent . 45 casings , probably more in the sand .
and this is interesting . . 45 slug , slightly deformed .
vest .
tell me something , cybil .
how did that money get up there in that ceiling ?
what do you mean ?
jesse put it up there .
it' s a little heavy for him to get up there all by himself .
you' re so paranoid .
yeah , i' m paranoid , because i think you tried to steal my money .
you don' t deserve the money , anyway .
you' re just an amateur .
if you' re such a pro , you know stealing it wouldn' t have done you any good .
the money is marked , miss l got lt all figured out .
you' re lying .
am l ?
the news said the money was untraceable .
the news ?
and the news doesn' t lie .
i' m sure they said that .
that way , when the idiots who stole it try to spend it , they get caught .
you want to know why , cybil with a " c " ?
because they were dumb shits and they listened to the news .
i never thought about it that way .
i guess not .
all right , here we go .
i' m pulling off here .
i can' t drive anymore .
i got to sleep .
can i help you ?
can you pump gas ?
good , because nobody does anymore .
fill it up .
you all be cool now .
man , what happened to your nose ?
what happened to your hair ?
we just came from another interrogation .
which reminds me .
quig , why do they call it a head butt ?
it' s not like i knocked that prick out by slamming my forehead into his ass .
yeah , that' s true .
i would have come forward sooner ... ... but i was busy getting my beak mended .
i heard about the robbery after the surgery .
i put two and two together and here i am , in the flesh .
i' il tell you what i told them other guys .
which is what ?
i knew one of them .
you' re certain of that ?
he' s a real crazy motherfucker , too .
he was ... ... sinister , you know ?
some creepy , freaky , level9 type shit .
dark .
kind that' s liable to shove a little snake up the coochies of women .
yeah , you better watch out for that one .
wherever he go , trouble bound to follow .
oh , my god !
is he dead ?
jumper cables might help .
did it hurt ?
that' s a funny question .
well , did it ?
i think maybe the first one did .
i could call the cops , you know .
you could try .
allow me .
need some spot welding done ?
he' s a real elvis impersonator ?
no .
what does that mean ?
remember when the king died in ' 77 ?
jesus , was it ' 77 ?
he had a clause in his will which stated that lisa marie ... ... along with any illegitimate child he may have fathered ... ... be entitled to his entire estate .
naturally .
that' s when i first met him .
did " him " have a name ?
yeah !
murphy .
thomas murphy .
where are you headed ?
can i come ?
can l ?
go get your bubble gum .
smoke ?
no .
but i do everything else .
it' s a nasty habit .
our music , rock' n ' rollmusic is basically gospel or rhythm blues .
i did not try to steal your money !
