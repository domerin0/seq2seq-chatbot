anything i can do to change your mind ?
nope .
no way .
no matter how hot it gets up there during the day . . . . . . there' s not a " " not a damn thing to do at night .
what the hell are you gonna do at night in the middle of nowhere ?
sleep like a winner .
doug , you' re a city boy with a low threshold of boredom .
you' il be back in two weeks .
come in the office for a minute .
i got people waiting upstairs .
i wanted to tell you . . . . . . senator parker' s coming to the dedication tonight .
he' s almost guaranteed the urban renewal contract .
do you know what that means ?
skyscrapers like this all over the country .
you design them .
i' il build them .
jim , i think you suffer from an edifice complex .
you' il never leave .
after the party , come on downstairs and watch me burn my black tie .
glad to see you back .
doug , i can' t understand it .
the dampers won' t stay opened .
whatever happened to " hello " ?
hello .
how are you ?
good .
you look like it took .
hi , mr. roberts .
just a second .
we' il miss you .
duncan know ?
he' s all smiles .
what electromagnets went in ?
doug ?
thompson g 4s .
don' t you think they should be g 12s ?
that' s what comes from last minute panic .
i' il fix it .
there' s ground water on that atlanta job .
bring the designs in today .
how about chicago specs ?
philadelphia ?
in a minute , guys .
well , hello .
welcome back .
are you taking any calls ?
who' s there ?
no , i' m not taking any calls .
are we gonna talk at all ?
no .
it' s my lunch hour .
well , i' m not a cheeseburger , you know .
you' re better .
all protein , no bread .
all i need to go with you is about eight glasses of water .
all i need to go with you is in that suitcase .
i got about a $140 worth of vulgar underwear for you .
first things first .
that' s nice .
years from now , when they talk about this , and they will . . . . . . remember to tell them that it was my idea .
got change for a 50 ?
sorry , it' s the smallest i have .
not a chance !
let' s see what we got here . . . .
twenty five , 50 , 60 . . .
. . . 70 , 75 . . .
. . . 85 , 95 .
that' s it exactly .
catch your tip next time .
all your security squad' s up there . . . .
hello , mrs. allbright .
hi , phillip .
we won' t be so messy tomorrow .
we' re gonna try charcoals .
mommy wants to know if you' il have dinner with us ?
thank you , but i' m going up to the tower party .
aren' t you coming ?
mommy says thanks , but she doesn' t go to parties since daddy died .
here , let me take that paint off .
bye .
how are you , phillip ?
sorry , mrs. mueller , what was that ?
i said how are you ?
okay .
goodbye .
okay , i' il get on it right now .
i' il have to check the panel .
have to see if all those light up .
mr. callahan ?
we still got any g 12 electrodes ?
yeah , main storeroom .
right .
okay , booster pump , zone one .
one ten .
check .
main generator , zone one .
i don' t get any reading .
try the auxiliary generator .
what the hell ?
go ahead .
here we are .
are there offices on this floor , as well as apartments ?
i wouldn' t like that at all !
the business offices only go up to 80 .
from the 81 st floor , here . . . . . . all the way up to 120 , it' s exclusively residential .
now , the apartment i want to show you is 8145 . . . .
say , bill ?
tune in the main utility room .
something' s screwed up .
the sensor didn' t trip the fire alarm .
why should it ?
you can see for yourself .
there' s no fire .
the sensor indicates there is .
plus wes just called .
he said they' re having wiring problems down there .
you better stay with it .
i want you up there with me .
we can do good things together .
what' s the matter ?
hello ?
dave' s leaving .
they' ve offered me managing editor .
that' s nice .
i mean i guess we' ve got ourselves a situation .
it seems .
i want the kind of life you' re talking about .
i want that .
i want a place where our kids can run around and grow and be free .
but ?
i want this job .
i wanted it for five years .
i' ve worked for it for five years .
now suddenly it' s there .
see , i have ideas , doug .
i can do something with it that hasn' t been done before .
i guess i want both , and i can' t have both .
can l ?
i don' t know .
where ?
be right there .
let' s hold this off till tonight .
what happened ?
we kicked on the auxiliary , and this shorted out .
power off ?
what about that ?
it should' ve been conduit .
give me a pair of dikes .
i know , i know .
callahan called me .
now just how bad is it ?
depends on how good your imagination is .
jesus christ !
specs called for conduit safety covering .
how many fuse terminals did you check ?
how many do i have to ?
mr. bigelow is here , sir .
okay , send him in .
now , doug , one piece of scorched wire . . . . . . from a burned out circuit breaker isn' t conclusive .
maybe not .
but now i' m worried about what other shocks we' re in for .
will , doug . . . . . . j. d. , wait till you see this .
what happened ?
was the wallpaper hung wrong ?
we have an equipment problem .
no problem in the tower , is there ?
could be .
come on .
you' re just guessing .
i want to talk to your son in law .
i wanna talk to him right away .
get roger simmons .
yes , sir .
i guarantee i' il check this out .
we' re all going to check it out .
i' m missing something .
we damn near had a fire .
yeah , a fire .
in this building ?
come on .
we haven' t finished installing the safety equipment .
the party should' ve been put off  hold it , will !
everybody' s overreacting .
mr. simmons is out , sir .
out where ?
they don ' t know , sir , but i left word for him to call .
we' il talk to roger tomorrow .
and then we' il decide what to do .
that' s okay , isn' t it ?
nope .
won' t wait .
try zone one again .
damn it !
this is top priority .
we gotta get these electrical systems on .
our security program' s loused up without them .
don' t go away .
doug !
well , what a surprise !
where' s that electrical genius of yours ?
i called his office , the club , the marina .
no luck .
what' s he done ?
come on , i' il get you a drink .
he must' ve done something .
my father called .
he hasn' t been that upset in years .
have any idea where he is ?
well my husband' s territory ranges rather widely .
it' s like that of the timber wolf , anywhere within a 50 mile radius .
but if you wanna wait , he' il show up .
he has to .
his clothes are here .
can i get you a drink ?
no , thanks .
i guess you don' t plan to tell me what roger' s done .
hi , doug .
honey .
hello .
what are you drinking these days ?
nothing , right now .
well , welcome back from the wilderness .
to what do we owe the pleasure ?
callahan was testing a backup generator .
there was a systems failure .
how can that be ?
it can' t be , theoretically .
unless you screwed around with the electrical specifications .
that' s being rather blunt , isn' t it ?
you betcha .
then you' il understand my being equally blunt .
what the hell business is it of yours ?
i wonder what kickbacks were involved .
i don' t have to take crap from you .
listen .
we had an electrical flare up in the main utility room .
some of that wiring wasn' t exactly what i asked for .
all the wire i put in is up to code , inspected and approved .
code' s not enough for that building !
and you know it !
i asked for installations way above standard .
buddy , you live in a dream world .
i deal in realities .
i want your wiring diagrams and copies of your work orders .
that would take weeks and a lot more clout than you have !
in my office !
tomorrow , 9 : 00 .
they say he used to wrestle grizzly bears in montana .
of course , he was younger then .
probably in better condition .
you must have enjoyed all this immensely .
no , i didn' t .
actually , i' m depressed for both of us .
what did you expect me to do ?
punch him in the nose ?
if you' ve done anything to dad' s building , god help you .
baby , i don' t need god' s help or your old man' s .
not anymore .
so don' t expect me to shake every time daddy barks . . . . . . even if that' s what you want me to do .
all i want is the man i thought i married .
i guess we' re running out of reasons to stay married , aren' t we ?
it' s getting late .
mustn' t miss the party .
stand back , please !
everybody , back of the ropes !
stand back , please .
everybody , back of the ropes !
hi .
7 : 30 sharp .
i hope you like your men prompt .
at my age ?
i only care that they show up at all .
nonsense .
be a good girl , elke .
i left you some milk in the kitchen .
see you later .
did you find simmons ?
yeah , i found him .
did he or didn' t he change your specs ?
he didn' t admit it , but i bet you he did .
payoffs and kickbacks .
the only way he could' ve swung it .
here you are . . . . . . your original specs .
zone one only , but we gotta start somewhere .
that son of a bitch gave us an impossible job .
susan .
hello , dan .
good evening .
how are you , dear ?
congratulations .
it' s magnificent .
thank you .
i' il meet you out front .
i' d like to talk to susan .
right .
find me the architect who designed you . . . . . . and who needs doug roberts ?
i do .
ladies and gentlemen , this is a gala evening .
the entire city is in a holiday mood .
the list of luminaries reads like a who' s who .
there are leaders from society and government . . . . . . stars of screen and television .
and now , just arriving , the honorable gary parker . . . . . . chairman of the federal urban renewal commission .
the senator' s in from washington to be here for the dedication .
senator parker , ladies and gentlemen .
we' il try to get him to the microphone to say a few words for you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you very much .
i' m honored to be here tonight .
this magnificent building represents yet another landmark . . . . . . in a long succession of landmarks for this great city .
i think you' ve got him in the bag , jim . being here at this historic moment .
thank you .
and now , ladies and gentlemen , mr. and mrs. roger simmons .
mrs. simmons is the daughter of the builder , jim duncan .
how are you ?
nice to see you , senator .
shake hands with mr. duncan , please .
where were you all day ?
i wasn' t aware the leash was that tight .
later , i wanna ask you a few questions . . . . . . and i expect some straight answers .
and now , ladies and gentlemen , mayor and mrs. robert ramsay .
i thank you very much .
i hereby dedicate this magnificent glass tower . . . . . . tallest building in the world !
we' il make it .
that' s it .
all right , callahan ?
hit them .
this way .
it' s really something , isn' t it ?
after you .
come on , dan .
i' m going by the office .
i' il be up in a few minutes .
i' ve never seen the bridge look like that .
it' s unbelievable !
astonishing !
how did it go down there , mr. bigelow ?
fine , thank you .
good night .
shall i leave you a night line ?
no , you can disconnect .
i' ve had it with phones for today .
lorrie . . . .
sorry , but i have a letter that must go out .
see you monday , janet .
gee , i never thought he' d come back here before the party .
we almost missed him .
it' s all right .
i' m not gonna do anything tonight .
have a nice weekend .
thanks .
you too .
hello .
hi .
promise me something ?
what ?
if i ever start taking you for granted , do something about it .
and what do you suggest ?
cut off the phone lines .
pour coffee down my neck .
tweak my nose ?
i promise .
how' s the family ?
fine , thank you .
good .
gary ?
would you excuse us , gentlemen ?
certainly .
i' ve got a surprise for you .
politicians don' t like surprises .
carlos ?
yes , sir .
what can i fix you ?
meet senator parker .
great pleasure .
it' s an honor , senator .
show him what you' ve been hiding back there .
yes , sir .
1929 ?
that' s all you' il drink tonight .
a whole case ?
what you don' t drink , we' il ship to washington .
open a bottle , will you ?
yes , sir .
how did you ever come by a whole case ?
come on , jim .
it' s nothing .
i guess you' re looking for someone .
i am .
have you seen him ?
i' ve ordered for patty .
what can i get you ?
nothing right now .
thank you , roger .
susan , tell me . . . .
what does a girl do in san francisco when her old man . . . . . . decides to leave for two years ?
beats me , buddy .
no headhunting ?
i' ve had a little trouble making that work .
could we discuss that tomorrow at lunch ?
no .
you must miss your villa .
well , yes and no .
it gets rather dull in the south of france .
nothing but swimming and yachting , partying and all that sort of thing .
and believe it or not , they fight over the few eligible bachelors .
even such old scraps as l .
no false humility , please .
oh , shall we ?
the stock market .
monte carlo' s losses , san francisco' s gains .
thank you .
do you believe in destiny ?
i believe in all good things .
there must be a reason for my coming back home .
meeting you .
this can' t be right .
it' s too hot .
you better leave it off .
utility .
wes .
doug , i' m up on 83 with will .
we got a wiring problem .
overloads could be trouble .
shut down as many of the zone one systems as you can .
i can' t do that .
all the lights are on for the dedication ceremony .
you mean the whole building ?
we' re taking the overload just fine .
well , shut it down right away .
i can' t do that without an okay from mr. duncan himself .
i' il accept the responsibility .
just turn off the lights !
what about the lights in the tower for the party ?
not all the power , just the overload !
yes , sir , mr. roberts !
we better get down to 81 and check the relay systems .
they turned on everything in the whole building .
there' s something on 81 .
phone it in , in case the lines to the fire department are out .
i' il be in 81 .
you got it .
get those drapes !
smother it !
try to smother it !
pull it around over here .
put it all over him .
come on !
let' s get some water onto that fire .
turn it on !
down , down !
stay low !
call an ambulance for this man .
get on the ball !
call an ambulance !
i want everybody off this floor !
the fire department ?
on their way .
get that ambulance .
give me a hand .
get him in the elevator .
all right , try not to touch him .
try to get him by his belt .
this is 81 .
a man' s been burned .
get an ambulance .
yes , right away .
call duncan in the tower .
he' s got a lot of people up there .
what ?
do it now !
it' s mr. roberts .
yeah , doug .
we were getting worried about you .
susan' s here , senator parker , the mayor and his wife .
they' re asking why the greatest architect isn' t here .
never mind that .
will giddings has been badly burned .
will giddings burned ?
how ?
an ambulance is coming , but you better think about . . . . . . getting those people down on the ground floor .
what for ?
we got a fire here !
well , i think it' s under control , but
well , then why the urgency ?
urgency ?
if fluky wiring in this building caused that fire . . . . . . fires could break out everywhere !
doug , i think you' re overreacting .
i feel sorry for will giddings , but he' il be taken care of .
but i won' t concern myself with a fire in a storage room on 81 . . . . . . because it can' t possibly affect us up here . . . . . . not in this building .
now , have someone call me when the fire department arrives .
meanwhile , get in your dinner jacket and come up and join the party !
what building' s on the corner of montgomery and
oh , jesus !
the glass tower !
what ?
the glass tower !
i sure hope that fire' s on the first floor .
did you ever fight one in a high rise ?
is it as rough as i hear ?
like being inside a chimney .
jesus !
how in the hell did they get here before we did ?
don' t anybody ever stay home anymore ?
mike , she' s throwing a lot of smoke .
eighty first floor , right ?
we' ve got lobby control , second alarm is in .
set up a forward command .
got it .
chief . . . . . . this is roberts , the architect .
what do we got here , kappy ?
fire started , 81 st floor , storage room .
it' s bad .
smoke' s so thick , we can' t tell how far it' s spread .
exhaust system ?
should' ve reversed automatically .
it must be a motor burnout .
sprinklers ?
they' re not working on 81 .
why not ?
i don' t know .
jim ?
yes , sir ?
give us a quick refresher on your standpipe system .
floors have 3 and 1 . 5 inch outlets .
gpm ?
fifteen hundred from ground to 68 , 1, 000 from 68 to 100 . . . . . . and 500 from there to the roof .
are these elevators programmed for emergencies ?
what floor are your plans on ?
79 .
my office .
that' s two floors below the fire .
it' il be our forward command .
men , take up the equipment .
let' s go .
architects !
yeah , it' s all our fault .
you know we can' t fight a fire in anything over the 7th floor .
but you keep building them as high as you can .
are you here to take me on , or the fire ?
what about the 81st floor ?
you got everybody out of there ?
i wanna see all floor plans , 81 through 85 .
gotcha .
this is what worries me .
those beams and that glass .
chief , 81 has been evacuated , but it doesn' t look too good up there .
give me a list of your tenants .
don' t worry .
we' re moving them out now .
not live ins .
businesses .
we lucked up .
most of them haven' t moved in yet .
those that have are off at night .
i wanna know who they are , not where .
what' s that got to do with anything ?
who they are ?
any wool or silk manufacturers ?
in a fire , wool and silk give off cyanide gas .
any sporting good manufacturers , like table tennis balls ?
they give off toxic gases .
now do you want me to keep going ?
one tenant list , coming up .
thank you .
what do we got ?
elevator bank , central core .
service elevators here .
air conditioning ducts , 6 inches .
pipe alleys here ?
one , two , three , four , five .
this is south ?
south .
have you got any construction on 81 ?
anything that can blow up , like gasoline , fabric cleaner ?
i don' t think so .
good .
i' il be up on 81 .
for what it' s worth , this is one building i figured wouldn' t burn .
neither did l .
and they' re celebrating .
a party .
what party ?
where ?
in the promenade room .
300 people .
why didn' t you get them out ?
why don' t you go talk to duncan ?
he ain' t listening to me .
i will .
here he is now .
this is duncan .
a battalion chief ?
i' il watch out for him .
thank you .
ted , take your men down to check that hallway .
jack ?
jack , how bad ?
i don' t like the looks of it .
it' s running the ceiling .
work it around .
up there .
i' il be up topside .
right .
jack . . . . . . watch yourself .
keep it high .
looking for me , chief ?
if you' re duncan .
i am .
everything under control ?
gotta move these people out of here .
now , just how bad is it ?
it' s a fire , mister , and all fires are bad .
you' re not familiar with the many modern safety systems . . . . . . we have designed into this building .
we' ve got them all .
it' s your building , but it' s our fire .
now get out .
i don' t think you' re listening .
a fire on 81 can' t reach up here , not in this building .
i' il do it .
hold it , hold it .
do you want me to pull rank with the mayor ?
with a fire , i outrank everybody here .
one thing we don' t want is a panic .
i could tell them , but you ought to .
just make a nice , cool announcement to all your guests . . . . . . that the party' s being moved down below the fire floor .
now .
patty , you and susan stay right here where i can find you .
now , don' t leave this table .
you , i wanna talk to .
did you change any of doug' s electrical specifications ?
i most certainly did .
for god' s sake , why ?
the reason should be obvious , especially to you .
we' ve got a fire .
if it was caused by what you did , i' il hang you out to dry .
and then i' m going to hang you !
would you please stop playing ?
stop playing , will you ?
ladies and gentlemen . . . .
ladies and gentlemen , may i have your attention ?
it seems that we have a small fire . . . . . . in one of our storage rooms . . . . . . 50 floors below .
i assure you there' s no danger .
but in accordance with the fire department' s orders . . .
. . . a purely precautionary procedure . . .
. . . we' re going to move the party down to the lobby for a while .
and we' il be serving cocktails and champagne in our continental room .
but i promise you , dinner will not be delayed .
now if we can all move to the elevators . . . .
now , ladies and gentlemen . . . . . . there' s no reason to rush .
senator parker , you and your party .
it' s really all right .
stay here .
i' il be right back .
lisolette !
frank !
lisolette !
how' s it going , chief ?
better get ready .
kappy , get the floor plans on 82 .
we got problems .
fire lapping ?
are your com lines tested ?
phone jacks on every floor .
i' m plugging into your pa system .
no sweat .
emergency setup ?
battery powered standby system .
splice these lines into our two way communications van .
sure .
no problem ?
no problem .
how long will this take ?
a minute .
not bad .
here' s our problem .
the fire' s lapping up through the windows .
get down !
get down !
what was that ?
come on !
the ceiling' s going !
men trapped !
we need help !
bring a line !
pull them out , pull them out !
pass the fire hose !
pass it along !
battalion two to forward command .
urgent !
forward command , go ahead .
explosion on 81 , fire headed toward elevator banks !
we need more crews up here fast !
they need relief on 81 .
hit it .
they' re on their way .
done !
tell duncan to stop those tower room people . . . . . . from using that express elevator , or somebody' il get killed .
ring in a third alarm .
i want some rescue squads and some choppers here .
we may need them to get those people down .
come on , park .
i' il be on 81 .
the fire' s moving toward the main shaft .
use the scenic elevator .
don' t overload .
i don' t like how you talk to me .
you drunk ?
not yet .
then get out of my way !
you didn' t talk like this before .
running over budget and out of money .
did you ask me then to shave $2, 000, 000 off our electrical costs ?
shut up and help these people !
let me ask , father in law  excuse me .
did you encourage other subcontractors to cut corners ?
where did you save the other 4, 000, 000 in doug' s original budget ?
please !
please !
hold everything .
ladies and gentlemen , i' m sorry .
move back into the promenade room . . . . . . and we' il take you down by the scenic elevator .
now these express elevators can be activated by fire .
and with the probability of short circuits . . . . . . the cars might stop on the floor where the fire is .
so please , we' il use the scenic elevators over there .
for god' s sake , get out of there !
please , back !
it looks bad , jack .
it is .
i got a couple of men hurt .
the fire' s spreading .
i got a third alarm in .
what about this ceiling ?
must have just happened .
i' il check the other corridors .
firemen , let' s pull it down before it falls down .
bring it out !
take it down !
empty all the water out .
chief , it' s out of control .
bring in another line !
get another tank !
angela ?
angela ?
phillip ?
phillip , open the door !
what ideas can i use upstairs . . . . . . to explain where i' ve been all this time ?
well , what you might do is just . . . . . . walk right up to him and say , " j. d. , i' m sorry for the delay . . . . . . but my secretary had an urgent personal problem .
what happens if he asks what the problem was ?
he won' t .
you know what astonishes me ?
what ?
you make love with a girl . . . . . . and there' s no visible evidence .
nothing to mark the event .
look at you .
you look like you could be going to church .
in this outfit ?
i love you .
did you leave a cigarette burning ?
that' s not a cigarette .
jesus !
get some towels .
stuff them under the door .
dan ?
right .
what' d they say ?
help' s on the way .
there' s nothing to worry about .
we' il just sit tight and wait till they get here .
i won' t panic .
not to worry , baby .
please , just join the end of the line .
oh , no , ma' am .
please .
but i can' t find my daughter .
she' s here somewhere .
they' re aware of that .
she' s wearing a purple dress .
i' ve got to find her !
i promise , they' il find her .
now , only 12 at a time .
i' m sorry .
that' s it .
we' il be in the next group , maybe .
it won' t be too long .
what' s she doing on 87 ?
forward command ?
i wanna speak to jernigan .
harry .
jernigan .
what ?
damn it , man !
you should' ve sent a man up there !
how do you expect her to hear a phone call ?
she' s deaf !
sure , the kids can hear !
i don' t know , maybe they were in the shower when you called .
you stay there .
i' il get them down !
all my men are committed .
i need fresh crews , damn it !
we' il send them right up .
still got people on 87 .
i' il get them down .
i' il give you a hand .
turn your face away .
there never were any firemen , were there ?
i said that to make it easier on you .
i switched off the phones .
there' s no way to call out .
nobody knows we' re up here .
well , i always did want to die in bed .
nobody' s going to die .
at least they' il never find out about us , will they ?
i used to run the 100 in 10 flat .
don' t go !
i' il be back with the whole fire department .
you all right ?
the mother and children are in there .
don' t worry .
we' il get them out .
wait !
please , mrs. mueller !
please stay back .
what do you think ?

then , sir , we' il just trot up the stairs .
you' il just trot right up to 79 , huh ?
standing by in the lobby .
thank you .
this ain' t gonna help any !
they won' t hear us in there .
there' s 300 people !
it' s a fire door .
it' s over 2 . 5 inches thick .
i could crawl through the duct .
will we be able to go with you ?
that leads to a pipe shaft that' s 135 floors straight down .
phillip , take care of these ladies .
they' re your responsibility now .
all right , i' il tell him .
how is it on 65 ?
they' re containing it .
well , it' s still below us .
let' s take a look .
okay , watch the electrics .
come here !
the master generator' s blown .
the backup should' ve kicked on .
see what' s holding up our starters .
what happened ?
where the hell are we ?
security , this is duncan .
have the main breakers gone ?
the whole system' s failed .
what' s the last report on the firemen getting here ?
are they on their way ?
hold on to me a second .
hold on !
christ !
that' s one of our men !
oh , god !
go down by rope .
better get it .
sir ?
we' il rappel down to 65 and use the top of that elevator as an exit .
why not pry open the doors at this level ?
i don' t think so .
i can' t make it .
i' il fall .
i know i' il fall .
then you better go first .
that way , when you fall , you won' t take any of us with you .
let' s go to work .
check all rooms in that corridor .
check this room .
tear it down .
see ?
just like we taught you in training .
open it up .
of course i read you !
i don' t know where he is , but if i see him , i' il tell him .
must be an easier way to get to a fire .
not for us .
where' ve you been ?
we had trouble getting here .
the navy flight commander needs you .
just walk 65 floors down ?
only five .
a freight elevator on 60' s running auxiliary power .
got it controlled ?
getting there .
you men stay here with the chief .
tell him i' m on my way .
oh , mike . . . .
this one of your men ?
dan bigelow . " nope .

okay to o' hallorhan .
he' s on his way .

carlos , give me that security phone , will you ?
how' d you get in here ?
i' il give it to you later .

can you send somebody up to break it loose ?
they' re on their way ?
how ?
oh , my lord , elke .
my poor cat .
she' s still in the apartment .
i' m sure the fire didn' t get up that high yet .
she' il be all right .
hello , ma' am .
hello .
how' re you doing ?
we' re fine .
glad to see you .
that' s the door right there .
it' s blocked with cement .
we' re gonna have to blow that thing .
mrs. mueller ?
it' s mr. roberts !
mrs. mueller !
phillip !
we hear you .
we' re gonna blow this door .
get everybody clear .
you' ve got about 30 seconds .
understood ?
understood !
okay , ma' am , let' s get down there .
out of the way .
please go back .
they' re gonna dynamite this door .
step back , please .
we' re blowing the door .
okay , get down low .
what kind of explosives are you using ?
it' s plastic c 4 .
blow a hole in anything .
here , shine this on the bag for me .
that' s it .
keep it up here .
is there gonna be a bang ?
nothing for you to worry about , baby .
you' il be safe .
okay , everybody ready ?
good going , brian .
you all right ?
i' m james duncan .
can we get down that way ?
no , not a chance , sir .
the stairway below is completely gone .
everyone , listen !
hold it down !
listen !
i' ve been informed that there' s no possibility . . . . . . of using this stairway to get out .
now , i' m sorry .
patty . . . .
there' s still a chance we can get out of here .
didn' t you hear what my father said ?
you can' t get out that way .
are you coming or not ?
if you have to wait for permission to save your own life , go ahead .
i' m getting out .
roger , you . . . .
come on !
come on !
let' s go .
you guys , hose the ceiling .
you two , in there !
i guess you thought i stood you up .
it crossed my mind .
you sure you' re all right ?
those helicopters , they' il get us out of here , won' t they ?
sure they will if there' s not too much wind .
some party .
can i get you anything else ?
the choppers are here , but the winds make a landing attempt too risky .
get some men on top of the peerless building . . . . . . and get a breeches buoy to the promenade room .
we can' t shoot a line that far in this wind .
why not shoot it from a chopper ?
i' il get right on it .
doc ?
chief , the ceiling fell in on him .
by the time i got to him , he was covered with hot stuff .
pretty ridiculous spectacle , right ?
there' s no way down .
thank god you' re all right .
oh , roger , what are we gonna go ?
i know what i' m gonna do .
get quietly drunk .
if you' re responsible for this , i know what you must be feeling .
you don' t know the meaning of the word .
responsible ?
feeling !
you know about responsibility .
it' s a family trait .
duncans are big in that department , at least on the surface .
that' s not fair !
i don' t think it' s wrong to feel a sense of duty .
sometimes , when you turn the exact same phrase . . . . . . iift an eyebrow in the exact same way . . . . . . i see and i hear your father .
the two of you , one !
like a big tree and a little tree in its shade , where the acorn fell .
roger , i came over here to you because i thought you might need me .
right now . . .
. . . what i need most . . . . . . is this .
i promised myself if i ever saw you again , i' d make a full confession .
no , but thank you .
but you don' t know anything about me .
but i do .
you' re penniless . . . . . . you have no villa in the south of france . . . . . . no antiques coming , no paintings .
but , harlee , i don' t care .
i' m a cheap tinhorn .
a two bit con man .
not cheap .
maybe unsuccessful .
but you see , your heart isn' t in it .
how can you cheat people effectively . . . . . . if you don' t enjoy cheating them ?
i came here to sell you 1 000 shares in greater anaheim power and light !
is it a good investment ?
there is no greater anaheim power and light .
only the certificate i had printed .
i think you' d have admired the artwork .
beautiful engraving .
i' d like to see it .
it' s in my jacket .
i took the jacket off .
it was needed elsewhere .
you see what i mean ?
i can' t even deliver a phony stock certificate .
did you hear what i said ?
every word .
then tell me you' re shocked . . . . . . or at least disappointed .
but i' m not .
you must be !
harlee , i' m not .
i' il be right back .
give me a few minutes with doug , will you , dear ?
sure .
will giddings is dead .
he died 20 minutes ago .
oh , boy .
i wonder how many more will be dead tomorrow ?
i thought we were building something . . . . . . where people could work , live and be safe .
if you had to cut costs , why didn' t you cut floors instead of corners ?
now listen .
any decisions that were made for the use of alternate building materials . . . . . . were made because i , as a builder , have a right to make those decisions .
if i remain within the building code , and goddamn it , i did !
oh , here we go again !
the building code .
come on .
that' s a standard cop out when you' re in trouble !
i was crawling around up there .
the duct holes weren' t fire stopped !
corridors without fire doors and the sprinklers won' t work .
and an electrical system that' s good for what ?
i mean , it' s good for starting fires !
where was i when all this was going on ?
because i' m just as guilty as you and that goddamn son in law of yours !
what do they call it when you kill people ?
who is it ?
chief o' hallorhan .
what happened ?
part of the central corridor just blew .
we' ve got in the fifth alarm .
the helicopters ?
it' s too windy .
we' il set up the breeches buoy on the peerless building .
what can we do to help ?
move your combustible material away from the window .
okay , gotcha .
there' s nobody on those drapes .
let' s get them .
jake , give me a hand .
did you reach her ?
the phones are all out .
just a little while longer , and we' il all be home together .
if only i could have talked to her .
let her know we were thinking of her .
told her how precious she is to us .
she' s still such a child .
she doesn' t even know where i keep the key to the safety deposit box .
how will she be able to get into it ?
i mean . . .
. . . if she should have to .
the things you think of .
do you wanna help me ?
here he is .
the wind' s down a little .
we' re gonna try for a landing .
get roberts .
get 10 people on the roof .
have the rest stand by .
we' re gonna start airlifting .
will do .
put these over there .
give me a pad of paper and a pencil .
give me that brandy snifter too .
doug , are they going to land ?
they' re gonna try .
we' il send the kids out first , then the women .
number these up to 100 or so .
high rise roulette .
high rise roulette .
that' s right .
there may not be time to tell you  there will be .
i' il go tell everybody .
pass those out when you' re ready .
there' il be a lot of wind up there , so everybody stay in one group .
come on .
stay back , stay back !
look out !
roberts !
roberts !
chief o' hallorhan wants to speak to you .
all right , make way .
coming through , coming through !
here he is now .
roberts , i know those pilots are dead , and l
god , it was just awful up there .
listen , our best chance now is the breeches buoy .
i told my two firemen to knock out a window .
we' il try to shoot a line from a chopper .
hey , one of you guys got a pair of clippers ?
sure , what do you want them for ?
i want to try something .
step back .
the firemen are gonna knock out the windows .
step back and you won' t get hurt .
may i have your attention , please ?
we' ve activated a gravity brake on that outside elevator .
there' s no power to bring it back up , but at least we can get 12 people out .
which 12 ?
the same group that was up on the roof and two additions .
the woman who saved the children' s lives and a fireman !
i want a trained man in there .
all right , let' s move it out !
marge !
take this .
take it !
you can get out !
go on .
what are you doing ?
i' m sorry .
i want you out of here .
so you can stop worrying about me ?
what about me worrying about you ?
it' s the only way you can help me .
help me .
if you asked me to go to the north pole . . . . . . or even the cliffs of mendocino , i' d go .
what if i ask you tomorrow ?
please .
ma' am , i' il take her .
thank you .
come on , phillip .
i' il never let you go anywhere without me again .
i don' t want to .
ever again .
i' il meet you in the lobby .
i' il be waiting .
we' re still a lady short .
you' ve gotta go .
i don' t want to leave you .
honey , i' il make it .
i promise you .
have i ever broken a promise to you ?
good luck , honey .
please .
all set , everyone ?
okay , here we go .
out of sight !
yeah , it' s coming .
let' s untie this , take it off , pull in the rest of the line !
okay , come on .
let' s get it through .
all right , hold it right there !
bring in another 20 feet of that main line .
that' s it .
all right , bring in a little more !
that' s it .
hold it now .
brace yourselves .
watch your heads !
grab it !
take it back and secure it !
all right , let it go !
let it go !
all right , go on !
take it out !
okay , take ahold .
how about the main line ?
secured ?
good !
chief !
explosion above 110 . . . . . . blew the elevator off its track .
it' s hanging by a cable .
how many people in it ?
loaded .
i' d say about 12 .
what' re you gonna go ?
flaker .
flaker !
sir ?
can you give me a chopper with a winch and some cable ?
have them pick me up on the peerless building .
got it .
try and get a hitch on that elevator .
drop it down to the deck by the chopper .
mommy , mommy !
i won' t cry if you won' t cry .
it' s all right .
yeah , take it up out of there .

don' t let go of me !
don' t let me fall !
don' t let go !
don' t let go of me !
get me out , please !
hold it right there .
okay , lower the cable .
grab that hook !
steady .
what about the torch ?
lash it tight .
this is o' hallorhan .
we read you , chief .
pick me up with the hook . . . . . . and set me down on the scenic elevator .
then you' il pick up the elevator and gently set it down on the street .
can you handle the weight ?
i think we can handle it .
we' il find out in a hurry .
watch it !
take it away !
how much time do we have ?
i wish i knew .
goddamn it , jim , you built the place !
i just don' t think that all of us are gonna make it .
well , i guess i' m next .
i don' t suppose you' il let me stay .
come on .
i' il see you soon .
i love you .
let it go !
you think this' il hold it ?
it' d better .
we have to cut the elevator cable .
what' s your number ?
68 .
47 .
here , mrs. ramsay , you' il be all right now .
you' il be all right .
tell my husband i' m all right .
tell him i' il be all right .
i will .
and i' il see him at home later .
i will .
let' s go .
oh , my god , you' re all right !
thank god you' re all right !
watch the ladder .
hey , mike . . . . . . deputy wants to see you .
mike , we' ve been checking the situation in the promenade room .
we figure they' ve got 17 or 18 minutes left , if that .
it' il take more than 3 hours to get them down by breeches buoy .
they' il die up there if something' s not done .
we might have the answer .
johnson' s a structural engineer .
tell the chief your calculations .
the structural strength of the joists in that room . . . . . . could definitely withstand the explosion .
what explosion ?
chief , we' ve got the copter ready .
wait a minute .
we' il handle that .
just get back to your job .
yes , sir .
what explosion ?
we can blow the tanks two floors above the promenade room .
they hold 1, 000, 000 gallons of water .
that' s enough to drown the fire .
you' re crazy .
mike , it' s the only way .
you could kill everybody up there .
i don' t think so .
you don' t think ?
when you take into account the stress factors , the design
wait a minute .
just hold it .
we' ve already made the decision .
someone has got to go up there , rig the charges and blow them .
there' s only two people qualified for that .
you and conners .
they just brought conners down .
he' s on his way to the burn center .
under the circumstances , we can' t order you to go up there .
i' m just laying it out for you .
but you . . . .
you see how it is , don' t you ?
how do i get back down ?
oh , shit !
the women are gone .
we are going next .
you' ve all got numbers .
and you' re gonna take your turn .
and if it' s any consolation . . .
. . . i' il be the last one out of here along with my son in law .
it' s out of control .
and it' s coming your way .
you got about 15 minutes .
now , they want to try something .
they wanna blow those water tanks above you .
they think it' il kill the fire .
how are they gonna get the explosives up here ?
they' il find some dumb son of a bitch to bring it up .
hang on , i' il tell them .
they want to put out the fire by blowing the water tanks above us .
we' il eat a lot of water and concrete , but if they don' t try it , we' il burn .
the fire' s out of control .
they think we got maybe 15 minutes .
this way , some of us might survive .
we got no options .
come on .
let' s go .
get that line .
get off !
you crazy bastards !
drop this line !
let go of me !
drop the line .
it' s not gonna work .
it won' t hold everybody !
get off !
get off !
get the hell out of there !
go !
get off .
chief .
we lost the breeches buoy .
it was panic up here .
it' s under control now .
i' il try and set down on the roof .
i' il need you up there .
i know where to place the charges , but i don' t know how .
i know how .
see you up there .
you' il have to tie yourselves down .
ropes , tablecloths , belts . . . . . . anything you can find !
carlos !
yes , sir .
get some knives .
there we go .
for god' s sakes , carlos .
don' t tie yourself up to a lot of glass .
that' s the ' 29 .
try it .
it' s okay .
doug . . .
. . . i never thought this could happen .
sure .
how much time you think we got ?
ten minutes , maybe less .
we' il have to blow the floors as well as the tanks , you know .
all right .
this is your detonator .
you' re running instantaneous .
i' m running delayed .
here you go .
this is your explosive .
this is the timer .
later on , after you throw the wire . . . . . . we' il plug it and splice it into the timer , set it , and it blows .
set your explosive like this .
take your detonator , pull the plug .
toss it .
got it ?
i got it .
good luck .
see you later .
okay , thanks .
here you go .
what will you set it for ?
five .
i think we can make that .
that' s it .
tie yourselves down , goddamn it !
you' il never make it through there .
how much time ?
three and a half .
here .
here .
i' m burning up !
let' s go !
fireman ?
bob !
bob !
excuse me .
she was in the elevator with you .
the fine looking lady .
mrs. mueller .
have you seen her ?
i' m sorry , she' s dead .
lisa !
lisa !
claiborne !
what ?
i didn' t want you to see him .
you know , there' s nothing any of us can do to bring back the dead .
all i can do now is pray to god . . .
. . . that i can stop this from ever happening again .
i don' t know .
maybe they just ought to leave it the way it is .
kind of a shrine to all the bullshit in the world .
you know , we were lucky tonight .
body count' s less than 200 .
one of these days , they' il kill 1 0, 000 in one of these firetraps .
and i' il keep eating smoke and bringing out bodies . . . . . . until somebody asks us . . .
. . . how to build them .
okay .
i' m asking .
you know where to reach me .
so long , architect .
