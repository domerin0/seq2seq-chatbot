so youre awake ?
fix something to eat .
i hope you like it .
help yourself
thank you .
i will .
very good .
wheres the guy ?
the man who brought you ?
i did what i could ... ... but his wounds were too deep .
i see .
i have no family .
he was like a brother to me .
im sorry .
war is cruel to everyone .
where is he ?
i cleaned his body ... ... changed his kimono ... ... and laid him in another room .
you did ?
thats one more thing i must thank you for .
dont let it concern you .
this is a very unusual temple .
are you its priest ?
no .
it was derelict .
not many come this deep into the mountains .
i dont get along with people very well .
ive been living here for years .
i see .
and the lady ?
well , its a bit complicated .
shes been here for years .
anyway , what are you going to do ?
now ?
yes .
iil take ...
... his body back to his home .
i have no home , but he does .
thats the only way i can mourn him .
thank you for everything .
iil take my leave .
whats your hurry ?
the enemy will be looking for you on the road you came .
to the west is a sheer cliff .
you could go down it , but in this rain ... ... it might collapse .
i say this for your own good .
rest the night here .
i have few guests .
i dislike society , so ive retired to this temple .
im glad to have someone to drink with after so long .
i know , considering your friend, that this is not an auspicious encounter ... ... but perhaps this, too , is some kind of destiny .
well ?
lets drink the night away ... ... and sit vigil for him .
iil take you up on that , then .
you have my thanks .
no , you have mine .
weil make a night of it .
this is a drink called " wine " , from a land called " france " .
its made from grapes .
a strange taste ... ... but a good one .
isnt it ?
drink up !
this liquor , and this temple ...
its all new to me .
is all of this from foreign lands ?
yes .
i traveled far before i chanced upon this temple .
and that buddha , is it foreign , too ?
the face is strange .
i carved it .
you ?
yes . living here , i have lots and lots of time .
its quite something !
its not so much buddha as a carving of me .
do you see ?
perhaps a little , now you mention it .
speak your mind .
its a very heavy rain .
well , it should stop by tomorrow .
the mountain roads are dangerous .
and there is a legend they tell of this mountain .
do you know it ?
no .
they say the long nosed goblin haunts this mountain .
tengu " ?
who haunts this forest , who seizes men to eat ?
the very same .
tengu " rules this mountain .
he hears the drop of a pin .
he sees a thousand leagues .
he scents the difference between a mans blood and a beasts ... ... and he eats only flesh .
but " tengu " is just the name ... ... that people give him .
hes really " aragami " ... ... a fury of wild violence , the raging god of battle .
you seem to know this well .
but isnt something as dangerous as that ... ... a threat to this temple ?
not really .
because this " aragami " ...
... is me .
you had me there !
sorry , sorry .
but " tengu " legend is real .
even if he did appear , you look like a strong man with a sword .
you could handle him .
what about you ?
to survive that battle , and those wounds ...
im sure more than a few men have fallen before you .
tell me ... ... how many have you killed ?
to count them would be in very bad taste .
oh ?
so you kill men in uncounted numbers ... ... and forget ?
shouldnt you remember the lives you take ?
ive killed 794 .
i remember ... ... their shape , their voice ... ... the last look on their face ... ... everything .
may i see my friend ?
he scents the difference between a mans blood and a beasts .
i smell it ...
you reek of blood !
enough !
youre drunk .
iil be on my way .
iil come back and thank you properly .
oh ?
no , id like you to do that now .
i want you ...
... to kill me .
are you mad ?
i told you ...
i am aragami .
but ive lived far too long .
ive been waiting for the one who will grant me death .
but it is not easy for aragami ... ... to have himself killed .
only a man worthy of the deed can cut me down .
this is crazy !
why would i kill the man who saved my life ?
thats why i ask .
youre in my dept .
stop , will you ?
you look like a man to me .
not " tengu " or " aragami " .
not all is what it seems .
not even a man .
one with a saintly face may betray you .
one with an innocent face may be prostitute .
one with an evil face may be good .
all right , lets say you really are aragami .
why should i kill you ?
take me to my friend , damn it !
youre a samurai .
you have a duty to accept my challenge .
why do i have a duty to fight the man who saved my life ?
you are no longer who you were when you came .
think about it .
isnt it strange ?
you came here two days ago ... ... with 13 sword cuts and four arrows stuck in you .
your wounds had festered , and you had a high fever .
and now ?
once a crazed lord kidnapped large numbers of small babies .
he believed he needed them to concoct a potion of immortality .
he thought newborns held untold possibility ...
... as nourishment ... in the treatment of wounds of disease and old age .
now , while this lord ... ... was simply a lunatic ... ... his idea was not completely wrong .
there is a mysterious power ... ... in human flesh .
my friend ...
where is he ?
to take your body ... ... past its limits ... ... the human liver is best .
yes .
you ate the flesh of your friend .
he bacame part of you , and gave you strength ... ... otherwise you were dead by now .
you bastard !
i understand how you feel .
how about another drink first .
what are you ?
hey , hey , hey !
will you look at this sword !
its about ready to snap .
this looks like it could be fun .
the nights still young .
lets take our time .
shut up !
huh ?
you go too far !
stop looking like youre dying .
its just a scratch .
hey ... hey .
give it a rest .
see ?
but you arent immortal , you know .
the head ...
... or the heart kills you .
anyway , lets have another drink .
now , this liquor is from a land called russia .
they call it vodka .
its pretty strong .
its from corn .
anyway , have a drink .
do you think im giong to just sit and drink ? !
how come im not dead ? !
i told you .
you ate the liver ...
so you just eat someones liver and you dont die ?
dont be silly .
look . ... no two cooks make the same thing the same way .
this woman is a good cook .
an excellent one .
so .
are you a demon, too ?
its been said that women are devils , hasnt it ?
shes more a devil than i am .
while youre at it ... ... could you kill her , too ?
hey !
whats in that ? !
i said it was strong .
what do you want ?
why are you doing this to me ? !
how many times do i have to tell you ?
i want to die .
fighting is the only reason to live .
ive always hoped id meet someone stronger ... ... but im tired
this body of mine will never get any older .
im not able to die naturally
why not cut your stomach open, then ?
dont ask me to kill you !
hara kiri ?
thats something mortals do from excessive self respect ... ... and stupid pride .
i am without fault .
why would i do that ?
besides .
i am aragami , the raging god of battle .
i was born to die in battle .
and i cant be cut down by some backwoods samurai .
no .
i will die when i encounter the one .
sophistry .
nothing you say makes any sense at all !
its absurd !
then let me ask you ... ... do mortals make sense ?
shabby politicians start wars where you kill each other by the thousand .
isnt that the reason youre here , and your friend is dead ?
isnt that absurd ?
listen ... ... the existence of this world is absurd .
all right , then . ... why did you kill him and choose me ?
you were both half dead .
i could only save one .
but why me and not him ?
no reason .
i just chose you , thats all .
would you rather youd died and been eaten instead ?
and look , i didnt kill him .
i gave you the chance to survive .
i could have let you both die .
but , now you have the chance to live .
theres a big difference .
consider yourself lucky you have the chance .
make the best of it .
who do you think you are ? !
you bring people here to split hairs , and then kill them .
what chance have i got ?
its just murder !
not all the ones i killed were people .
they werent ?
wherd he go ?
sometimes demons or goblins look like people .
there are beings in the world that are beyond imagination .
they made me realize that i wasnt human ... ... that i was aragami .
demons , goblins , aragami ... what are you talking about ?
as i told you , the world isnt always what it seems .
many who look human arent so at all .
warriors who defeat vast numbers of the enemy ...
miraculous survivors of disease or accident ...
people say theyre lucky ... ... but thats not it .
thyre human , but then again theyre not .
oh , i get it .
if youre aragami , maybe i am , too .
maybe .
thats not true !
neither of us looks anything other than human .
some birds fly high up in the sky , but some never leave the ground .
its not strange that humans come in different forms .
my being here ... ... is proof of existence beyond what is known .
i say white , you say black .
i just dont see it .
no , you wouldnt .
i used to think i was human , too .
i went looking for battle from the moment i was born ... ... and i fought lots of men .
no one could beat me .
i couldnt help wondering why i was so strong .
and then in time the whole world knew my name .
i became feared
no man would face me in a fair fight any more .
wait ...
what is that name the whole world knew ?
who , me ?
yeah .
miyamoto musashi .
musashi ?
youre the musashi who never met his match ?
it doesnt matter now what my name was .
but he died years ago !
yeah , thats what i heard .
you know " rumors " .
youre historys greatest samurai in the world ? ... and also youre an inhuman aragami ?
is that it ?
yeah , something like that .
and you want me to fight a monster like you ?
thats right .
what an idiot !
ow !
that hurts !
sorry , sorry .
youre musashi !
ow !
ow !
give me a break !
what the hell .
ive already died once .
alright .
your swords no good any more .
take what you like .
no , not that one .
thats mine .
you said to take one .
sorry .
i recommend ... ... that western one .
its called a " broadsword " .
its heavy , and it cuts .
the owners of these weapons are all dead ... ... so feel free .
forget that sickle and chain .
the rooms too small .
too many pillars .
how will a bears claw help ?
ninja stars are for losers .
that guns good .
its a " pistol " .
the latest weapon from the west .
it fires a bullet with gunpowder , like a matchclock .
it wont be easy to hit me with it , of course .
hey , wait a minute .
shooting me when i was asleep wouldnt be much fun .
i thought id wake you up .
i am not able to sleep .
tell me ... ... have you ever dreamed ?
of course .
i dont sleep , so i never have .
thats too bad .
a good dream is fun .
id like to try it someday ... dreaming .
about the gun ...
you have to pull the hammer back to fire .
that was your friends sword .
its a good one .
killing me with it would be a nice way to mourn .
so thats your choice ?
so you mean to win ...
youre my kind .
we cant turn away from fighting .
if were the same kind , and youre aragami ... ... what does that make me ?
beat me and youil find out .
im glad we met .
thats a sneaky trick !
yes !
i like that !
thats why i chose you .
this is the central moment of your life .
stake body and soul , present . past and future ... ... and show me !
youre the man i chose .
cant you do better than that ?
the hammer ...
you wont beat me with that .
i guess not .
i thought maybe he was the one .
is there no one in this world who can stand against me ?
he was a real samurai .
give him a good funeral .
you ?
the world isnt always what it seems .
didnt you say that ?
yes , i did .
im sure you have no equal under heaven .
but look up ... ... therere millions of stars above .
youve made me realize what i really am .
this is indeed a world of wonder .
fascinating .
youre the one ive been waiting for .
you werent waiting for me .
i was searching for you .
thanks .
this is the best moment in my life .
what manner of being are you ?
beat me and youil find out .
i see ...
the world is so wide , and still full of mystery ...
now you can sleep .
i can ?
so this is sleep ...
hey ...
... do you think ... ... i can dream , too ?
yeah .
i wonder what hes dreaming ...
what will you do ?
iil stay here ...
... with you .
you will stay here ... ... and continue your battle .
oh, well ...
ive got nowhere to go .
i guess iil stay .
aragami ...
i wonder whos going to beat me .
iil be here to see .
