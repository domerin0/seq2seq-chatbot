thank you , thank you , thank you .
you are my god .
my inspiration , my everything .
he' s on a different level now , how he listens ... ... and plays records .
i think he' s very special ... ... because no other dj can do that .
i don' t know what he was doing , whether he was ... ... honing his talents in another direction .
he just disappeared from the scene completely .
it was really depressing .
he' s probably down in south america , still hanging out .
probably trying to snort up one of the countries , or ...
i don' t know , he' s just ...
i like to think he' s still out there .
frankie , i' m curious .
can you tell me about your flip flop collection ?
i' m a bit of the lmelda marcos of the flip flop world .
flip flop , for me , is perfection .
and sometimes if i' m stuck and i can' t mix , i can' t ...
you know , i' m a creative person .
i' m an artist .
so sometimes i just stare at a flip flop for hours .
i' m not joking .
i' m being serious , yeah .
really ?
yes , i do .
recently , you' ve been married ... ... so how is it now being a husband ?
an " ass band " ?
husband .
oh , husband .
husband .
a husband .
yeah , it' s very nice .
it' s what i' ve ...
say hello !
hello , lbiza !
dj !
dj !
dj !
dj !
this is pete tong , you' re listening to the essential selection .
i' m sitting across from frankie wilde .
how are you , frankie ?
i feel like a star , man .
eleven years .
eleven years in ibiza ... ... playing some of the best clubs in the world .
how do you feel about it this year ?
what , mate ?
it' s your 11 th year , frankie , playing in ibiza .
you must be thrilled .
it' s been fucking hot , ain' t it , here , the last week ?
god .
i mean ... ... think about ...
you' re old , like me .
you' re an old geezer .
you remember that martini campaign in the ' 70s ?
martini is
dot , dot , dot , dot .
remember that ?
when i was a kid , that wow ed me out , man , bigtime .
it' s like , " is " what ?
what the fuck is it ?
what the fuck is martini ?
but i was young , and i didn' t really understand .
lbiza is
dot , dot , dot , dot .
you know what i mean ?
and that' s really nice .
it' s really nice to be able to feel that .
there' s spunk everywhere on this island .
everyone' s done it , and they' ve been free with it .
they haven' t done it to make babies .
they' ve fucking swung out and spun a bit out ... ... and it' s hit a plant , and that' s grown .
wall , and there' s vines and ivy and shit .
it' s all spunk .
look at this lot out here .
look at them .
they all love it .
they fucking love it .
who out there likes to fucking party ?
yeah !
i can' t hear you !
who out there likes to fucking party ?
who likes to fucking party ?
yeah !
frankie was definitely one of the best .
he had his very , sort of , own style ... ... his very own momentum with the crowd .
no one else did it his way .
he' s a showman as much as he is a musician .
he controlled the crowd musically and physically .
he was a born natural behind the turntable .
there' s no doubt .
i was jealous of that .
i always had to try a bit harder .
super , super , super , loco .
frankie was cruising along , doing his thing ... ... getting all the attention that he needed .
and then he met max .
no .
hey , tell him it' s like a wasp just stung my clit , yeah .
i don' t give a fuck if he' s religious .
tell him anyway .
fuck him .
bye .
anyway ...
a bit of a tosser .
not my sort of person ... ... but absolutely took him to the next level .
i love you , max !
max first brought frankie to my attention .
i knew he had what it took behind the decks ... ... but it turned out that frankie really understood the music production side .
you know , knew his way around a studio .
do you think we' re making a jazz album ?
i' m just right in the middle of going all the fucking way .
should we swap them over for some brushes ?
start fucking hitting those drums .
start banging those drums like you bang your fucking sister !
clear , siegfried ?
that' s the first one .
so i signed him straightaway .
and frankie delivered .
it was massive .
come out of car windows , in the supermarket .
even my grandmother ... ... would whistle that tune when i went to see her in the nursing home .
frankie met sonya when they were on the video shoot to " rise again .
oh , man .
i mean , everybody knew that she' d been about .
but he seemed to like that .
i mean , that was his thing .
you know , i mean , even i' d had a go at her .
15 love .
i was thinking , you know how paul newman' s got ... ... his salad dressings and that ?
so why not frankie wilde hummus ?
that' s a good idea .
people come and see the gigs ... ... they say , " fuck , that was a great set , frankie .
i' il say , " cheers , mate .
you want some hummus ?
you know , just as a thing .
yeah .
quite a good name for an album .
how' s that ?
frankie wilde , hummus .
what , call my album hummus ?
yeah .
i don' t think so .
i' ve got good ideas , frankie .
you should listen to me .
if i' ve got my own hummus brand and my album' s called hummus ... ... it' s getting a bit much .
i think it' s a good name .
why don' t i change my name to " frankie hummus " ?
no , it sounds good .
yeah .
i think a lot of people tolerated her because she was frankie' s wife .
at the end of the day , i think she was partying with everyone else .
i didn' t like her .
i didn' t think she was good for him .
i fucking hate you .
i fucking hate you .
and did i fuck her ?
yeah .
yeah , i fucked her .
legend has it that frank' s problems started undramatically .
it was the simplest thing that kicked it off .
it was years and years of noise was the basis of the problem .
but the very beginnings of it , in his life , started very plainly .
frankie' s problem was quite a common problem amongst dj' s ... ... an occupational hazard .
they work in the clubs .
the noise just takes its toll .
this geezer' s gonna go .
he' s gonna lose it .
and he did lose it .
i watched him lose it , slowly but surely .
fucking come on , then !
i think we could have the spanish look , i like this color for the water .
perhaps maybe that one , japanese .
frankie .
morning , honey .
oh , frankie !
come here .
i want to ask you something .
morning .
morning , sweet ...
you all right ?
if we go for the spanish look ...
it' s for the garden .
a bit of both .
okay .
little bit of both .
we can do that , can' t we ?
yeah .
fuck !
fucking hell !
you all right ?
his hearing was fucked .
but he tried to keep working and plow through .
you know , put the horse blinkers on .
ignore the problem , and it' il go away .
you know , always works for me .
can you tell us what' s happening with the new album ?
have i got a spot ?
have i ... ?
no .
it' s fine .
you' re perfect .
you' re perfect .
your fans are curious about the new album .
they have to know .
it' s good .
it' s going really well .
it' s going really well .
been bending the sound , sort of .
i' ve been forging it .
with a lyrical smelter .
yeah .
not as beautiful as you .
thank you .
and i got these two ... ... like , austrian mates ... ... who are stoking the fires .
everybody should have at least two austrian mates .
everybody should have at least two .
when can we expect the new album to come out ?
soon .
soon ?
ish .
can i have a word ?
can i have a word ?
yeah .
it' s good ?
i took a call just before , a couple of hours ago .
i forgot to mention it , but i need to ...
i need to ...
the album people , they want the lyrics for the sleeve .
i just need you to write them down .
we can pop them off .
get them off and we don' t have to worry about it .
no , no , we never write them down .
that' s it .
what else did you sing after that ?
frankie .
frank .
frank !
what ?
have you got a condom ?
have you got a condom ?
no , i' m not gonna fuck her .
i' m knackered .
i' m just gonna have a nosh .
frankie !
frankie !
frankie !
well , denial is a river in frank , and it runs deep .
and his sets were shambolic on times .
clearly , could only be the work of a man who couldn' t hear .
it wasn' t pretty , but , you know , for me ... ... for someone that has gone through something like that ... ... to still get up there and give it a go is a big thing .
off !
off !
off !
off !
let go , fuckers !
fuckers !
fucking fuckers !
because they dangle when they' re cold .
yeah .
now , listen very carefully , okay ?
it' s very important .
this is very important .
i have cancer , okay ?
and i' m very delicate .
so they have to be very gentle .
hey , frank .
all right ?
how are you ?
all right .
attaboy .
how you doing ?
good , good .
motherfucker .
listen , i had that dream again .
i was sucking my own cock .
but this time , i don' t have a huge cock .
i have a normal sized cock .
no spine .
my spine disappears .
so my head , it just flops down onto my ...
anyway ...
you all right ?
yeah .
sit down , sit down , sit down .
look , i was just talking to the label ... ... and they' d like to see a couple of tracks .
the label would like a couple of tracks , frank .
it' s coming .
it' s coming .
yeah .
the tracks are coming , man , relax .
don' t worry , mate , it' s fine .
it' s all right .
i saw your show last night .
i tell you , i really fucked up last night , man .
it' s my call .
i picked the wrong set .
it stunk .
it stunk like shit , frank .
it stunk like ...
well , like you shit your pants ... ... and you just sat in it for a week , and then you shit yourself again .
that' s how fucking bad it stunk , frank .
it was shit , yeah ?
it was shit , frank .
yes , it was shit .
i tell you , the fucking monitors at that place .
you know , i' m fucking mixing my heart out .
i can' t hear a fucking thing .
we gotta have words with them ... ... get this sorted out , otherwise we blow that place out .
i couldn' t hear a fucking thing .
right .
because you might be deaf , frank .
what' s that ?
you could be deaf , frank .
what you saying ?
you are deaf .
can' t hear you , max .
you' re fucking deaf , asshole !
who the fuck you fooling , frank ?
you' re talking like a 95 year old war vet .
frank , you need professional help .
i' m thinking about getting some professional help .
yeah .
yeah .
fuck it .
hello , frank .
come in , frank .
frank !
i don' t want you to panic , frank .
i' ve got some bad news for you , though .
you' re going deaf .
completely deaf .
as you know , your right ear is completely shot .
your left ear , that' s this one , has got 20 percent left .
you were born with little holes in them ... ... and slowly the fluid pressure is dropping .
can' t you just plug it up with some ear putty or something ?
the ear organism , it' s way too sensitive and delicate for that .
surgery doesn' t work .
cochlear implant doesn' t work .
you' ve gotta stop exposing yourself to so much noise .
what do you mean by that ?
it means that if you listen to absolute silence ... ... your ears are gonna last a little bit longer .
they' re crumbling as we speak .
stop the drugs , frank .
stop the drinking .
go to bed at a decent hour .
we can give you a hearing aid that gives you temporary hearing ... ... but that damages the ear even further .
speak up .
these are the facts , frank .
these are the facts , frank .
we can' t change them .
you are deaf , man .
you are a deaf man .
this is costing me 2000 fucking euros an hour .
chuck me a fucking bone !
this is your hearing aid , frank .
use it only when you have to .
only when you have to .
only when i have to .
right .
only when you have to .
got that ?
no exceptions .
can you keep on gigging ?
frankie ?
can you keep on gigging ?
can you keep on gigging ?
i love them both , you know ?
i love hearing , and i love dj' ing .
i was thinking this morning maybe i should write a book .
that' s a brilliant idea .
that might take years , though , so ...
perhaps , like , a pamphlet .
a sort of brochure thing .
listen , frankie , i ...
i want to tell you that whatever your decision ... ... i will support it wholeheartedly .
you and me and little kingie .
that' s all that matters to me .
deaf , dumb or blind , baby , we will get through this .
it' s brilliant to almost hear that .
fair play to the guy .
i have no idea what i would have done in that situation .
i mean , there he is .
you know , he' s between a rock ... ... and you know , another rock ... ... which is harder and bigger .
hi .
i' m actually thinking about giving it a bit of a break .
of course i fucking love you .
how can you say that ?
i just think we don' t necessarily bring out the best in each other .
not always the best thing for me .
it' s my problem .
it' s not your problem .
you know what i mean ?
why can' t we just be mates for a little bit ?
i could just give you a ring every few weeks , you know ?
just make it a little bit more casual .
couldn' t we do that ?
it sounds like the caca .
no .
is frank there ?
is this frank standing in front of me ?
no , this is a drunken baboon drooling on the mix board .
what in all of the heavens are you on , frank ?
are you fucking deaf or something ?
what' s your fucking problem ?
they would laugh you out of austria .
i can hear them laughing now .
where is frankie fucking wilde , frankie ?
is he fucking gone ?
and the fucking , " go away .
stay , stay , stay , " huh ?
so you' re deaf ?
you' re deaf ?
almost .
this is like all the terrors and the horrors of the world ... ... raining down on your skull .
last three months , it' s really rapidly accelerated .
but i' ve ...
i' ve got this .
and i really thought i could do this job , man .
i' il show you .
hello , mr. drum !
drummer !
the left ear , there' s still a little bit left .
and this little fella is a fucking lifeline , man .
but i can use it only when i have to .
long as i' m careful , i can hear more .
what ?
what has happened ?
what ?
he was stone fucking deaf .
there' s not much you can do as a dj if you can' t hear .
generally , the field of music ... ... other than the obvious example ... ... has been dominated by people who can hear .
he was never gonna hear again .
it was as simple as that .
it was ... ... gone .
all right , frankie ?
all right ?
blink !
hola , mate .
all right ?
all right .
good game ?
is it a good game ?
yeah , it' s all right .
it' s pretty good .
it' s decent .
sonya in ?
sonya in ?
yeah , she' s here .
she' s upstairs .
she' s packing , mate .
she all right ?
she' s leaving you , frank .
she' s leaving you .
for me .
get in there !
did you see that ?
fucking hell !
fucking , how was that one , eh ?
ter fucking rific !
yes , brilliant , wasn' t it ?
want a line ?
not right now , thanks .
cheers .
frankie .
you all right ?
yeah .
i' m leaving you .
i' m gonna take the tiger .
that' s mine .
and i want those ones , obviously , because they' re mine .
and you can have the sculpture that your mother bought us .
aren' t you upset , frankie ?
do you wanna say anything to me ?
anything at all ?
frankie !
where the fuck' s the album , frank ?
where the fuck is the album , frank ? !
where the fuck is the album ? !
it smells like shit in here , frank .
what the fuck' s happened to you ?
what the fuck happened to you , frank ?
i don' t know what this is .
i don' t know what this is .
this is bullshit , frank .
this isn' t how you take on things , huh ?
listen ...
maybe this isn' t the worst thing in the world .
take some fucking time off .
go in the sun for fuck' s sakes , huh ?
eat a lot of fruit , get some fucking vitamins in you .
vegetables and greens and shit .
i can' t ...
you know , there' s ...
i was reading yesterday ... ... there' s a fish , it' s called a zebra fish .
has little hairs on it .
and somehow , they can implant that ...
i don' t know .
it' s too fucking hot .
it' s always too fucking hot .
i can' t help you .
i don' t know how to ...
i don' t know how to help ... i don' t want to help you .
i can' t help you .
i didn' t want a deaf dj on the label .
i didn' t want the company to be touched with the deaf stamp .
well , business is tough ... ... and sometimes you have to make awkward decisions .
and i' ve made harder decisions than dropping the deaf dj .
frank just locks himself up in his room ... ... didn' t come out of his villa for a long time .
he had this theory he was gonna get his hearing back ... ... by having complete silence .
he wanted to rest his ears completely .
he hired people to bring in supplies for him to the villa .
the only accounts we have of frank during this period ... ... come from various drug dealers .
he was in a very dark place .
i love you too .
where is frankie wilde today ?
what ?
i haven' t ...
i haven' t talked to him in almost a year now .
i' ve heard some stories .
this guy supposedly saw him in new york ... ... wearing a garbage bag for a hat and shoeboxes on his feet .
and he ...
and he had a rock ... ... and he was trying to eat it like a sandwich .
i don' t ...
i don' t think frankie would do that .
he looked like a bum .
he always looked like a bum .
but he had a really special bond with the homeless .
hello .
hello ?
hello .
is this where you come if you want to learn how to read lips ?
of course .
you want to learn ?
i' ve got no idea what you' re saying , darling .
i can' t hear anything .
this is the place , yeah ?
they look like a couple of cunts .
i don' t know how to lip read .
maybe you should write something down .
i can' t hear you , and i can' t read lips .
so we need to get started somehow .
so , maybe , write something down .
temper , temper .
watch .
concentrate .
watch my lips .
watch ... ... lips .
tongue .
jaw .
one' s facial expression ... ... gesture .
lip reading ... ... is about seeing ... ... feeling .

very similar gesture .

what do you want to drink to ?
do you want to drink to something ?
who' s simon ?
silence .
who is he ?
not simon , silence .
are you finished with him ?
good .
great .
i know what i could do .
i know what i could do .
i know what i could do .
fuck the dj lark .
you know on tv , you got a little ugly bird ... ... bottom right hand corner , doing all this business ?
i could do that .
i could be a cool one .
a cool little fucker in the corner of the box .
i could .
think positively .
yeah .
are you going down to pacha tonight ?
oh , no , mate .
no , i' m staying in because frankie wilde' s ... ... at the right hand bottom corner of the tv tonight ... ... doing the fucking hand jive .
it' il be brilliant .
you finish ?
you finish ?
there' s nothing wrong with being deaf .
i' m deaf .
trust your other senses .
your sight , your smell and your touch .
just relax .
it will come .
it just takes time .
it will come .
well , frank' s system was ingenious , and with the weight of his sight ... ... he proclaims that he began to see a rhythm in everything ... ... a pattern in the visual world around him .
you know , could see music .
frankie had worked with this all his life ... ... and then he realized he was able to piece together ... ... those sets that he used to do .
and ...
hey , presto , you know , four to the floor , returneth .
i once stole 500 quid from your wallet , in the studio .
well ... ... it' s only money , eh ?
no big deal .
and it was me who stuck that scaff bar ... ... through the windscreen of your merc .
it wasn' t that asian kid .
well , he' s probably out now anyway ... ... so no harm done .
i shagged twila .
for three years .
because you' re a mate , yeah ... ... i only ever made love to her bum .
she doesn' t like it in the bum .
have a listen to this .
tell me what you think .
yeah ?
open the door !
frank !
frank !
open the fucking door !
open the door !
frank !
frank !
open the fucking door !
do you want some more coffee ?
frank !
frank !
open the door .
open the fucking door .
so ?
oh , frank .
oh , god .
yeah ?
oh , god , it' s good ,
fucking good .
it' s good ?
okay , it' s fucking hot .
first off , did you ... ?
who' s this ?
max , this is penelope .
penelope , this is max .
hi , max .
hi .
forget it .
look , did you mix this ?
yeah .
did you produce this ?
yeah .
oh , fuck .
fuck it , frank .
it' s gold .
fucking gold .
it' s beautiful .
tell me !
i haven' t heard it .
it gets in your fucking chest .
i' ve never heard nothing like it .
like fucking heart .
it changed ...
what ... ?
what do you mean you haven' t heard it ?
what do you mean ?
well , i haven' t heard it .
why ?
i' m completely deaf , max .
completely ?
yeah .
nothing .
to the handicapped .
sorry .
the first time i heard hear no evil ... ... i was like , you know , " whatever .
but then max told me frankie' s story ... ... and the penny dropped .
people love a good tragedy .
people love handicaps , frankly .
it gets them emotional , you know .
so i' il get on that deaf train with a wheelchair ramp .
no problem .
first class ticket , please .
i don' t see why we should limit ourselves to deaf people , really .
i don' t want to reveal too much either ... ... about where we' re going .
but it' s gonna be big .
it' s gonna be big , and it' s gonna be handicapped .
imagine all the deaf people , all the deaf people in the world .
imagine all the deaf people , all the deaf people in the world .
they need a fucking hero , frank .
they don' t have a fucking hero .
there' s no deaf hero , huh ?
it' s you , frank .
you' re , like , the fucking link .
you' re drawing all the deaf kids that are screaming , with no hearing .
they' re yelling out to ...
who' s gonna listen ?
not other fucking deaf kids .
they can' t hear , huh ?
you .
you' re the fucking voice , eh ?
and wait .
wait .
you' re gonna love this .
can you hear me ?
no , i can' t hear you , max .
are you trying to make me money ?
yes .
i' m making you money .
okay .
fuck , look ... ... that is just the fucking beginning .
i wouldn' t put my name to any old product .
if i could describe it ... ... as bad speed in a can .
we' ve all had bad speed , haven' t we ?
i' m just gonna have a sip .
i can' t resist .
fuck .
he made disabilities cool .
what' s with the fucking ear ?
the ear , that represents your deafness , okay .
deaf people hate their ears , see .
don' t they ?
see ?
so it' s symbolic .
so you' re gonna smash it .
the deaf kids are gonna go fucking nuts .
don' t actually hit the ear ... ... because i' il put some glass on that and turn that into a table .
it' s wank .
i' m sucking deaf cock for you , mate ... ... and i' m fucking choking on it .
all right , first off , okay ... ... you' re sucking show biz cock .
but look , this is gonna be good money .
this is all about cash .
shitloads of cash , frank .
and better than that ... ... sonya can' t get her grubby fingers on this fucking money , understand ?
this is sonya free cash .
he' s not a whore !
look , frank , okay ?
you' re not giving me any fucking positive feedback .
i need fucking ...
you know what really fucking bothers me about you ?
the fact that you think art just fucking happens .
it' s just free .
like these people just took out ... ... time from their fucking day to come down here ... ... and do a bunch of shit for nothing .
what you gotta realize ... ... is you' re a hero .
that' s what the yellow' s about .
you make fun of me on that jacket .
i picked that jacket .
deaf kids all over the world are gonna see that yellow .
they' il run out , they' il buy that jacket .
two , maybe $300 .
they' re gonna run around , proudly deaf ... ... all just yellow , fluorescently deaf ...
sit down .
charlize bondo , ibiza beat .
frankie , can you really dj as a deaf man ?
how is that possible ?
they murmuring ?
yeah , quite a bit .
i' m an honest man .
and i can tell you that this album was made ... ... completely without the aid of my ears .
and at pacha next week , i' il be dj' ing as a deaf man .
and if you don' t believe me ... ... you know , fuck you ... ... because i' ve got nothing , nothing to prove ... ... to you sluts at all .
okay .
okay .
role model .
nothing .
wait a minute .
okay , role model .
listen .
listen to me .
no .
no .
he loves sluts .
frank loves sluts .
now , i think what he' s trying to say is ... ... even though he feels he has nothing to prove to you ... ... he' d be happy to prove anything you want , to you .
it' s important that we all realize that this is a major comeback from a rock .
you know , what he' s accomplished in the last few months is astonishing .
he' il be at the pacha nightclub .
you can come down ... ... and watch him mix yourself ... ... and watch the miracle happen , okay ?
because , you know , i realize , okay , that there are doubters in this room ... ... which fucks me up .
because , you know ... ... why would someone pretend to be deaf ?
i mean , that' s retarded .
that' s ridic ...
it' s not like he' s fucking benefiting from this .
it' s a fucking obstacle .
he can' t hear a fuck ...
your mom' s a cunt .
nothing .
zero .
blank .
this man , what he' s done , fucking ...
it gets me in my fucking heart , what he' s done .
and you ...
you come down here , and you put on this big fucking show ... ... like he' s gonna fucking make shit up !
relax .
relax , man .
all right .
next question .
one more !
one more !
i thought it was amazing , you know , that somebody ... ... that' s deaf can actually ...
can actually ... ... you know , be a dj .
frankie wilde , good luck .
good luck .
i just think that guy is so fantastic .
he has a gift that no one else has .
and somehow , he is gonna do it .
frankie !
frankie !
frankie !

i' ve heard a story that he' s running a record shop in oxford .
there' s a story that he went to fiji and then died of syphilis .
