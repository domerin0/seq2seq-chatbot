relax .
don' t annoy him .

don' t argue .
i don' t argue .

i might have a heated discussion with somebody .
is this you not arguing ?
because you suck at it .
morning , everybody .
morning , sir .
it' s ....
sir .
okay , everybody .
i know you' re all concerned about grant' s condition .
so i' m happy to report ... ... jerry' s gonna be fine .
he' il be out of the hospital in two weeks .
he says he' s expecting lots of gifts .
okay , everybody .
so much for the good news .
we got another letter from the citizen .
arson , explosives , poison ... ... this guy never works the same way twice .
the only thing we know for sure ... ... is , we get these letters full of incomprehensible riddles ... ... he strikes and suddenly the clues make sense .
this one is down in intelligence .
hopefully , we' il get a lead before somebody gets killed .
in the meantime ... ... matthews , get a team together .
sir , you want me to take point ?
for five years you' ve wanted it .
last night , you earned it .
pick your team .
i want preliminaries by 3 .
that' s it .
sir ... ?
who' s buying me lunch ?
sir , i would like to talk about what happened last night .
i didn' t exactly follow orders
exactly " follow orders ?
there' s no such thing .
you follow orders or you don' t .
no arguments , sir .
none whatsoever .
until the hearing , you' re out of the field .
the hearing is totally warranted .
wouldn' t i be better on the citizen case ?
i have a background in profiling and decoding .
i could contribute .
like you contributed last night ?
by putting yourself and 5 agents in jeopardy ?
i' il save the rest for the review board .
you will bury yourself under a mountain of paperwork .
discussion is over .
mike , give me a pint .
rough day ?
the worst .
sure you want a whole one ?
yeah .
hit me big time , baby .
hey , einstein .
if you figure out that citizen letter , let me know .
congratulations on the op .
it' s a big shot .
thanks .
how are you doing ?
you okay ?
i' m good .
you' re starting early today .
yeah , i' m gonna get chip faced .
want to join me ?
i' d love to , but i have a pressing social engagement .
beth !
brownie meeting .
mike , give me a beer and ....
milk .
give her milk .
white wine spritzer .
are most of the people in here agents ?
as a matter of fact , here' s an agent .
gracie hart .
beth carter .
right back to you .
beth is an undergrad at vassar , doing a paper on law enforcement .
i' m helping her get an inside look .
i bet she' il do the same for you .
gracie , i would love to get a woman' s point of view .
you' re barking up the wrong tree .
right , hart ?
do all the women have to wear those really masculine shoes ?
i get these made special by the guy that put the tattoo on my ass .
we' il leave you with ben and jerry .
catch you later .
nice meeting you .
you too .
hope you have a good time at the mall .
wohop is the place .
wohop is good , but if you like variety , you go to la chinita linda .
their rice and beans are slamming .
i don' t want variety .
i get pork fried rice every
i figured it out !
i tried to create a content based pattern ... ... similar to his previous letters .
but this time , he used a signifier .
in this case , the word " miss " ... ... in the subsequent letters .
will you let me finish ?
it' s the miss united states pageant .
yeah .
intelligence thought so too .
what do we got ?
miss united states from san antonio , texas , home of the alamo .
i forgot the alamo .
the pageant lasts three days .
preliminaries , conferences ... ... the live telecast .
it' s a logistical nightmare .
not just a babe fest .
jesus , we' ve only got 48 hours .
okay , gentlemen .
where do we start ?
you might want to call the network and pageant people .
set up a meeting .
because you' il probably need their cooperation .
yeah , i can do that .
let' s do that .
what about jurisdiction ?
the citizen has been ours from the start .
you might want to call san antonio .
grease some wheels so they like us ... ... when we need manpower and tech .
while i' m at it , let' s do that .
good idea .
he loves to make a splash .
his target will be public ... ... like one of these outdoor prelims or a tv broadcast .
telecasters at the convention center .
we' re gonna need surveillance on the interior perimeter .
we' il need more .
there' s a million places ... ... only these bikini stuffers can go : backstage areas , hotel rooms ....
we need to get somebody in there .
yeah !
now i' m thinking ... ... undercover .
good idea , boss .
i got just the girl .
that' s nothing .
check this out .
compliments of my daughter : the " dress up sally " web site .
what did i tell you ?
hot , right ?
yeah , baby .
you got a little problem .
she' s perfect !
look to the left .
down ... down ....
there you go .
" on maternity leave " ?
that' s not gonna work .
not unless it' s " the miss lamaze pageant .
can you do a search ?
female field agents under 35 .
jensen , jensen !
wait , wait , wait , wait !
i got it , i got it !
oh , no !
that' s right , that' s right !
you think that' s good ?
check this out .
i got the winner right here .
scorekeepers ready ?
this is the best part .
he' s right behind me , isn' t he ?
not really my color , is it ?
sir , we were just ... ... looking for someone to go undercover at the pageant .
and i' m the best we have .
it doesn' t inspire much confidence .
get back to work .
hart , shouldn' t you be at a desk ?
yes , sir .
you don' t say anything ?
made me look like an idiot .
do i have eyes in the back of my head ?
he was standing right behind me .
what were we gonna say ?
what ?
this one .
are you kidding ?
it' s hart .
cut it off .
let' s go back to work .
very funny .
hold on .
that' s not bad .
hold on , nothing .
hit the save button because you won' t see that again .
what do you say ?
no freaking way .
why not ?
i won' t parade around in a swimsuit like some bimbo ... ... named gracie lou freebush , and all she wants is world peace .
it wouldn' t be like that .
you' d be on the undercover team .
right .
in a thong .
in a tasteful one piece !
you do a few butt shaping exercises ... ... you could pull this off .
you know what ?
pull this off .
is it because mcdonald hates me ?
or is it , like , a woman thing ?
don' t kid yourself .
nobody thinks of you that way .
he' s punishing me , isn' t he ?
i had to beg him to let you do this .
that' s right .
like it or not , you screwed up , pal .
sit down , sit down .
i' ve never been in a beauty pageant .
i don' t even own a dress .
i don' t even own a brush .
which part of that is supposed to shock me ?
let' s suspend reality for a second ... ... and pretend i said yes .
i got to do everything ?
like ... ... the whole big hair and the makeup and
damn right .
the spinning , the twirling , the smiling , the cute little tap number .
hundred bucks on matthews .
i don' t know .
she' s got rage .
i' il take that bet .
yeah , baby .
so you' re saying ... ... i have to wear the bathing suit ?
yeah , you have to wear the bathing suit .
okay .
you go , girl .
where am i gonna put my gun ?
no place i want to know about .
what could possibly motivate anybody to enter a beauty pageant ?
scholarship money , a chance to see the world ... ... broaden your horizons
so join the marines .
it' s like feminism never even happened .
any woman that does this is catering to misogynistic neanderthal mentality .
i dated young miss scarsdale .
can you really be this superficial ?
hard to believe , right ?
here we are .
therefore , we' d like to use one of our team undercover .
am i hearing this correctly ?
kathy , these people want to put one of their agents ... ... in the pageant .
they want her to win ?
no , ma' am .
we will need your help with the judging ... ... so our agent is in the top five ... ... to have access to all the areas at all times .
absolutely not .
miss morningside ... ... we understand how important this beauty pageant
excuse me .
this is not a beauty pageant .
this is a scholarship program .
and it has been ever since my reign .
i fully intend on maintaining that credo .
absolutely , miss morningside .
we' re here to protect the girls .
women .
scholarship ladies .
there' s nothing more important to me than the safety of my girls .
i' d rather cancel the pageant than have them blown up .
especially without their knowledge .
we went to the network to cancel , but they refused .
we can' t force them .
i' m confused .
what state is she going to be from ?
all the winners have been chosen .
we recently discovered some information about miss new jersey .
and her performance in a little film called arma get it on .
was that her ?
oh , yeah !
she was gonna drop out pretty soon , if you know what i mean .
do you have an agent in mind ?
sorry .
let me get you victor melling' s number .
frank .
he' s our pageant consultant .
frank .
maybe he can do something to help .
frank !
this is my assistant , frank tobin .
hi , everyone .
would you get these people victor' s number , please ?
and get me a spring water .
and for god' s sake , tuck in your shirt .
that , that was ... a water for you ... ... and ....
victor melling' s number .
mr. melling .
how are you ?
if you are grace hart , i quit here and now .
i' m having a bad hair day .
bad hair decade , really .
i' m eric matthews .
we spoke .
your hair is perfect .
however , i can' t accept this job .
there' s no way on earth i can make this woman ready in two days .
please , mr. melling , give it a chance .
sit down .
have lunch .
totally on the bureau .
i suppose that would be the civilized thing to do .
actually , i' m gonna take a rain check .
i got a lot of fbi stuff i' ve got to take care of .
that thing i told you about that i gotta do .
but i' il see you later .
we' il hang out .
you like caps ?
i' il get you an official fbi cap .
see you later .
be good .
what a pity .
are you hungry ?
yeah .
yes .
yeah .
it is always " yes , " never " yeah . " sit down .
miss united states is always well spoken and polite .
do you understand ?
watch the hands , garon .
excuse me .
it' s all right .
i have a feeling we' re going to need a drop cloth later .
could i have another cabernet sauvignon ?
another keg for you ?
i' m good , thanks .
that' s okay , philip .
so , how long have you been doing this pageant training thing ?
i' m sorry ?
what was the question ?
i was distracted by a half masticated cow ... ... rolling around in your wide open trap .
excuse me ?
what is your problem ?
problem ?
yeah .
i mean , yes .
have i offended you in some way ?
you' ve been completely antagonistic to me from the second i walked in .
i was once the most sought after , highly paid ... ... consultant in pageant history .
i had no idea .
every season , girls would plead with me to train them .
ten out of 11 years ... ... my girls were crowned .
the year we lost , the winner was a deaf mute .
you can' t beat that .
then ... ... in ' 96 ... ... my girl froze like a puddle halfway through her aria from la bohme .
afterwards , she told a reporter from pageant magazine ... ... that i was a perfectionist ... ... who had harangued her to within an inch of her sanity .
of course , after that article came out ... ... nobody wanted me .
okay .
with all due respect here ... ... why did miss morningside suggest you ?
because i am the best .
or perhaps it' s because everyone else worth having had a contestant .
they had their southern belles , their midwestern farmers ' daughters .
spunky western cowgirls .
and i have ... ... dirty harriet .
will you desist ?
yeah .
yes .
oh , my god .
i haven' t seen a walk like that since jurassic park .
it' s been working really well for me for the past 30 years , all right ?
well , glide , now .
glide .
don' t look down , don' t look down .
don' t look down , look up .
your chin should be parallel to the floor .
now glide .
glide .
it' s not the bloody ice capades .
gliding .
no , no .
don' t pick your feet up .
don' t pick your feet up .
why are you picking your feet up ?
because i' m preparing to run away .
no , wait .
wait .
watch me .
glide .
glide .
see ?
glide .
it' s all in the buttocks .
don' t i look pretty ?
it takes a very secure man to walk like that .
roll your hips .
head up , head up .
keep gliding
i' m gliding here !
what are you , blind ?
asshole .
look how she walks .
she' s floating .
lightly ascending from cloud to cloud ... ... towards heaven .
he takes one look at that fake rack ... ... he' s gonna send her right back .
look , she' s gonna cry again .
if i only had a brain !
i am somewhat less than amused .
how' s she doing ?
with some intensive work ... ... she' il be ready for the world' s finest trailer park .
thank you !
both painful ... ... and grotesque .
isn' t it ?
oh , my god !
mr. vic , we got everything you asked for .
where do we start ?
teeth , hair , manicure , pedicure .
which one first ?
what are you gonna do to my teeth ?
hopefully , remove the beer stains and steak residue .
can' t i get some novocain ?
it' s only a cleaning .
sweeney todd , what are you doing ?
your hair should make a statement .
as long as it' s not , " thanks for the country music award .
you' il be lucky if i can get it untangled .
no mercy .
can i borrow that drill ?
attention .
attention .
all hair removal units , wax , electrolysis , laser ... ... to commence at 2300 hours .
bikini wax .
how you doing ?
ever seen one this big ?
sandwich , i mean .
that' s a lot of meat .
thank you !
nobody said this job was easy .
this earpiece lets you hear anybody on our frequencies .
i don' t need it .
with all this foil , i' m getting hbo .
this is a pin camera .
there' s an actual lens in there .
it provides a digital video feed to our hookups .
here' s your new i. d. s .
pageant identity .
gracie lou freebush ?
i remembered you liked that .
well , my iq just dropped 10 points .

what could possibly be taking this long ?
hart , is that you ?

especially when you' re from a small state
that' s so true !
us rhode islanders  i wasn' t finished .
did it sound like i was ?
i' m sorry .
why are you apologizing to her ?
she' s been drinking too much coppertone .

yeah , i am .
in hawaii , don' t you use " aloha " for hello and goodbye ?
so ?
if you' re on the phone with someone who won' t stop talking ... ... and you say " aloha , " don' t they start again ?
at least she thinks i' m funny .

and even though i' il be retiring this year ....
well , don' t cry for me ... alabama .
that' s so sad .
he' s retiring .
he' s not retiring .
i spoke to him this morning , and he blurted it out .
they' re firing him , going for someone newer and younger .
i hope it' s ricky martin .
jesus christ !
i' m sorry .
i had a bite of my bagel and i forgot to pray .
dear jesus , please forgive me ... ... for not praying before i had a bite of my bagel and schmeer .
thank you very much .
amen .
i hope i' m not disturbing you .
oh , no , i was just , you know ... ... grooming .
i made some of my famous hot chocolate .
my roommate' s asleep , or she' s starting to mold .

i asked some of the other girls ... ... but when they heard " chocolate " they slammed their doors .
they didn' t give me a chance to say " nonfat .
well , here' s to ... ... world peace .
world peace .
hot .
i' m sorry .
i have to tell you ... ... i thought it was really great how you settled that argument today .
aloha , aloha .
that' s why you' re gonna win .
you' re so clever .
you should tell jokes for your talent .
what is your talent ?
it' s it' s kind of like ....
it' s , you know , it' s like a surprise .
but don' t worry , it' s nothing embarrassing .
not anything like baton twirling or anything .
so , what' s your talent ?
oh , cheryl , i' m sorry .
twirling can be a real art .
i saw this cheerleader doing it at a football game .
she lit her batons on fire and did this sexy dance .
i wish i could do something like that .
why can' t you ?
my parents don' t like anything ostentatious .
and they really don' t like fire .
cheryl , i think you have as good a chance as anyone to win .
you believe in yourself to have gotten this far , right ?
really ?
yeah .
you' re so nice and so smart and so sensitive .
you' re definitely gonna win .
that' s it .
excuse me .
i am in the middle of a rem cycle over here .

you don' t walk , you float .
gently descending , you don' t look down .
go back up and do it again .
never , ever look down , okay ?
thighs touching ....
touching , not clenching .
i' m touching .
there' s a gap between knees and calves , your calves and your ankles .
right now there' s a huge gap between my brain and my spinal cord .
here .
take these .
what , no armored car ?
that would be in my other dress .
what are you planning to do for your talent ?
sing ?
dance ?
chew with your mouth closed ?
i' il do whatever you want , yoda .
oh , lord .
agent matthews !
this woman has no talent !
don' t shout it in front of her .
i wasn' t told to provide a talent .
i can' t do so in the next five hours !
wait a minute .
what are you talking about ?
she' il be on stage with nothing to do ... ... but convert oxygen into carbon dioxide !
you said you couldn' t make her pretty in two days , but she' s gorgeous .
compared to the car wreck she was before .
my duties are stated in a contract , and i have fulfilled them .
you talent her up by tomorrow or  are you threatening me ?
listen to me , you old fruitcake !
how dare you , you cupcake !
there' s something i know how to do .
i haven' t done it since high school
you' re not having sex on this stage .
i didn' t know it was an option .

enjoy the rest of your night .
gracie , you look so tired .
oh , she had a busy night .
i saw that gentleman stop by the room .
gentleman ?
no men in the room .
it' s different on the mainland .
hold on , ladies .
let' s hear her side of the story .
you sleeping with a judge ?
oh , that guy ?
no , no , i was dating him for a little while because ... ... he said he had an incurable disease .
i didn' t realize it was stupidity .
oh , i know what that' s like .
he is such a pathetic loser .
i' m sorry he' s obsessed with me , but at some point it' s like , " hello !
move on !
get over yourself !
his ego is this big .
but his equipment is like this big !
good cover !
we worked that out together .

i made it very clear you weren' t responsible for making her credible .
i wish i could explain ... ... but there are no words .
eagle eye .
you might want to check out cowboy at 1 : 00 .
my 1 : 00 or your 1 : 00 ?
the one under the white stetson .
there' s stetsons everywhere .
he' s moving , he' s moving .
toward the stage .
hold on , we' re checking it out .
guys , he has a gun .
he has a gun .
who' s got the 20 on the shooter ?
i' m taking him out .
wait for a visual !
gun !
gun !
everybody down !
better up to them , don' t you think ?
in a bizarre incident at the miss united states preliminaries ... ... the contestant from new jersey leapt off stage ... ... and tackled a man in the crowd who was trying to light a cigarette .
she' s here with me right now .
what were you thinking when you jumped off the stage ?
all the contestants are actively involved in ending tobacco dependence .
i think the gentleman will think twice before he lights up again .
i' m sure we all will .
look , he had a gun .
of course .
this is texas , everyone has a gun .
my florist has a gun .
i don' t have a gun .
my ancestors were quakers .
stan , please !
we assume any man with a weapon is a suspect .
we got the dna results .
the envelope from the citizen was licked by a woman .
there' s never been dna before .
he slipped up , or i should say " she .
this is preposterous .
you people are completely clueless .
if i ran my pageant like this , we' d be holding it in someone' s basement !
every operation is bound to have its screwups .
as far as i can see , she' s still with us .
oh , god !
could i have a moment alone with miss hart , please ?
sure .
just for a tiny minute .
we' il just be a moment .
shop talk .
hair , gel , mousse .
look , i know i made a mistake .
i' m sorry .
i' ve been fighting all my life against your type .
the ones who think we' re a bunch of worthless airheads .
you know who i mean .
feminists ... ... intellectuals ... ... ugly women .
i refuse to give in to their cynicism .
that' s why i have dedicated my entire life to this scholarship .
no one' s going to ruin that .
not this year .
you get in my way , i will kill you .
do you understand ?
yeah .
yes .
frank !
the interview is the single most important part of the pageant .
it accounts for 30 % of your total score .
what' s the other 70 % , cleavage ?
is this your idea of doing final preps on the convention center ?
look .
liberace' s got her in a nice evening gown .
mcdonald called .
he saw hart' s anti smoking commercial .
he' s on his way .
good , perfect .
i' d hate for him to fire me over the phone .
i can' t believe this !
it' il be ugly .
no shit .
i gotta do something .
i' m gonna go do laps .
we' il go over tomorrow' s assignments .
you got it .
hands folded . .. ... ankles crossed .
neck up !
and remember , smile .
smilers wear a crown , losers wear a frown .
i would so love to hurt you right now .
as long as you smile .
now ....
why is new jersey called ... ... the garden state ?
you can' t fit " oil and petrochemical refinery state " on a license plate ?
i don' t appreciate your immaturity ... ... when i' m working as hard as i am .
what' s the big deal ?
it' s fixed , i' m in the top five .
congratulations to me .
is that enough ?
have you no pride in yourself , in your presentation ?
i' m an fbi agent , right ?
i' m not a performing monkey in heels .
you' re also a person , and an incomplete one at that !
in place of friends and relationships , you have sarcasm and a gun .
oh , i have sarcasm ?
when every word that comes out of your mouth is dripping with disdain ?
that is because i am a miserable , grumpy elitist , and that works for me .
i don' t have relationships because i don' t want them .
and i don' t have friends because i work 24 7 .
and you have no idea why i am the way that i am .
as we' re practicing interviews , why are you the way you are ?
none of your damn business .
the judges probably have never heard that before .
we have more to do here .
no , we are finished .
finished ?
give me a 20 on matthews .
be advised he' s at the pool .
how do you feel about gun control ?
favorable .
thought i' d let you know i was quitting .
take care .
hold on .
wait a minute .
what do you mean ?
i mean , you got the wrong girl .
all right ?
i do not need this now .
that' s what i' m saying !
i' m totally screwing up in there !
i don' t feel like a real agent anymore .
i mean , vic says this thing that' s so ....
i don' t care what he said , you know ?
i don' t care .
because i am the job ... ... and i' m okay with that .
you' re the job ?
yeah , i' m the job .
we' re all the job .
then what' s wrong with me ?
i date .
i know everyone thinks i haven' t had a date in 10 years .
is that what you think ?
i think you date .
damn right i do .
but both times it was screwed up .
i don' t even care .
all i want to do ... ... is my job .
for the last three days i feel like i' m completely lost .
i' ve been waiting five years to run my own op .
would i blow it on the wrong girl ?
you picked me ... ... because i looked good and wasn' t on maternity leave .
no , that' s why they let me pick you .
know why ?
lost a bet .
you' re smart ... ... and funny and you' re easy to talk to when you' re unarmed .
give yourself a break and cut vic some slack .
because if they see what i see , then ... ... they' il love you .
so , what do you say ?
i won' t let you down .
good , that' s what i want to hear .
in all honesty , i might let you down .
but i' il try my best not to .
do not mess with the dress .
oh , vic is gonna kill you .
you in big trouble .
why ?
you fell .
you look good wet .
shut up !
whoa , guys , hart' s in the dressing room .
come on .
you see the legs on that girl ?
who' s your daddy ?
those better be candy dishes !
turn around .
open .
this guy' s like an inch from death !
but what a way to go !
break it up .
nothing to see .
what do you mean ?
she' s a federal agent .
guess it' s time to apply at my local hooters .
hemorrhoid ointment ?
you think the judges will look that closely ?
it' s for the baggies under your eyes .
really ?
good , hair spray .
finally something i recognize .
what are you doing ?
it stops the suit from riding up .
riding up where ?
just up !
that' s enough !
why do you make things hard ?
i can see this is an incredibly embarrassing situation for you .
why does georgia get to wear a one piece and i have to wear this ? !
if you can do this , then you can convince anyone that you belong here .
places , everybody !
let' s go !
the swimsuit preliminary accounts for 15 % of the total score ... ... and tests the grace , athleticism and poise ... ... of each lovely woman .
the last time i was naked in public , i came out of a uterus .
i don' t have breasts , my thighs i should wear a muumuu .
i have avoided this experience all my life .
and here it is .
you must achieve a zen like state .
listen to your breathing , feel your heart ... ... think of the dalai lama .
texas !
rhode island !
new jersey !
dalai lama , dalai lama , dalai lama ....
new york !
california !
i would have to say , world peace .
definitely , world peace .
that' s easy .
world peace .
world peace .
what is the one most important thing our society needs ?
that would be harsher punishment for parole violators , stan .
and , world peace .
thank you , gracie lou .
and thank you , stan .
cheryl frasier from rhode island .
that was charming .
are you drunk ?
glad you enjoyed it .
now excuse me , i have to go unscrew my smile .
we got a lead .
the blood test ?
photos .
cheryl frasier , with members of a radical animal rights group ...
... involved in bombings .
it' s always the quiet ones .
loner , introverted .
that cheryl ?
describe your perfect date .
that' s a tough one .
i' d have to say april 25th ... ... because it' s not too hot , not too cold .
all you need is a light jacket .
now , there is a hardened criminal .
maybe she' s an accomplice .
maybe she' s his inside connection .
that' s what you gotta find out .
how ?
buddy up to her , you know , girl talk .
girl talk ?
yeah , girl talk .
sorry , i' m totally drawing a blank .
leg waxing , fake orgasms , the inability of men to commit .
why don' t you talk to her ?
imagine she' s me and you want to know , but i don' t want to talk about it .
what would you do ?
you want me to beat her ?
why don' t you talk to her ?
okay , forget about it .
i will go .
put that back in your ear .
i can' t talk girl talk with a guy in my head .
i can' t even do it with me in my head .
girl talk .
oh , my god !
hey , rhode island , how you doing ?
how can you ask that ?
you heard my interview .
i was like a female rain man .
oh , no , it definitely wasn' t rain man .
definitely not rain man .
come and have a midnight snack with me and some ... ... girl talk .
are you crazy ?
we can' t have pizza and beer !
do you know how many calories you' re talking about ?
it' s light beer and she' s gonna throw it up anyway .
come on .
come with .
no ?
no takers ?
no ?
all right , i' il just ... ... sit here .
you guys go back on your bicycles ... ... and i' il sit here with my very large , cheesy pizza .
oh , look at all that cheese .
cheryl , don' t .
at least scrape off the toppings .
first step , pizza .
second step , flaming batons ....
i guess we' il be needing more pizza .
i want another drink !
we' re gonna get a drink .
another round , ladies ?
i can' t do another one !
yes , you can !
this is so weird !
this is my third one of these and i don' t feel a thing !
really ?
kinda like when i answered my interview question .
don' t worry about that , we all sucked .
you know , i had such a good answer to that question too .
my idea of a perfect date would be a man ... ... who takes me to a romantic dinner .
then we walk along the beach barefoot , discussing books ... ... and music and movies !
no wonder you' re still a virgin .
time to paint .
come on .
no , my contacts .
we' il stay here .
i want more pizza .
we' re gonna have some more pizza and beer .
have fun !
this is so much fun .
yeah , it' s fun .
it' s so fun it should be illegal .
speaking of illegal , have you ever , like ... ... committed a crime ?
yes !
yes , i did .
go on .
one time i stole red underwear from the department store .
my mother wouldn' t buy them !
she said they were satan' s panties .
so is that it ?
yeah .
oh , there was this one thing in college ... ... with my lit professor .
one day i came to his office .
he said he wanted to discuss a paper i wrote .
he wanted to discuss a paper , right ?
hey , can i get another one of these tubie things ?
yeah , can we get another tubie ?
anyway , he attacked me .
che cheryl , did you report him ?
oh no , i never told anyone before this .
i know that kind of thing happens all the time .
no , no , it doesn' t !
cheryl , it doesn' t .
you know , there' s like so many maneuvers that i could show you .
really ?
yeah !
come on , you know , get up .
i want you to firmly plant your feet .
i' m gonna move the chair .
now if someone comes at you
she' s completely trashed .
we should get her back before miss morningside finds out .
kathy' s got a boot up her ass about something .
i don' t think she ever got over those rumors .
come again ?
her pageant years she was a runner up .
but then the winner mysteriously got food poisoning .
bizarro !
no , stan told me she got a letter a few weeks back from the network ... ... and they' re firing her too !
she threw a chair out the window !
we gotta go .
come on .
i got 20 people here waiting for confirmation .
don' t tell me i don' t understand .
i hate when i don' t see a wet paint sign .
stop it .
listen .
can' t hear you , took out my earpiece .
i have a lead and it' s not cheryl .
forget it .
they bagged the citizen .
what ?
where ?
it' s confirmed .
he was holing up in a shack in nevada .
place had enough c4 to make a new grand canyon .
let' s pack up and get out of here .
sir , i need to talk to you .
one second of your time .
hear me out a second .
i feel the situation bears further scrutiny and our continued presence .
do you have paint in your ears ?
we caught the guy !
i respect what you' re saying .
i' d say the same to me ... ... but what if we were wrong ?
what if the citizen didn' t send it ?
what if it was a copycat ?
the letter didn' t follow the normal pattern .
the linguistic scheme was uncharacteristic ... ... and the dna said it was a woman !
maybe he got his girlfriend to lick the envelope .
i think we have reason to monitor morningside .
why don' t you jump on her dressed like a bavarian fruitcake ?
you' re the reason i had to drag myself down here ... ... and i don' t want to hear anymore !
you' re absolutely right , sir .
not another damn word .
thank you .
but she' s getting fired this year , which she didn' t tell us .
you' re already in enough trouble with the review board .
yeah , but when she was in the pageant , the only reason she won was ... ... because the winner got food poisoning .
how bizarro is that ?
bizarro " ?
she threatened me .
according to mary jo , she has a history of violence .
who is mary jo ?
are you getting your information from a pajama party ?
would you shut up ?
you' re shutting up enough for both of us .
is there any reason to suspect morningside ?
no , sir .
there .
i request permission to stay with a small contingent .
denied .
then i request permission to stay alone .
you know what , i don' t care what you do .
you want to stay , stay !
but as a private citizen .
turn in your badge and your gun .
everybody , i suggest we start packing .
what ?
don' t look at me like i betrayed you .
betrayal implies action .
you stood there .
you got nothing to go on .
i know everyone thinks i' m a screwup .
but i feel like i' m in the right place at the right time .
i have to protect those girls .
it is my job .
part of it is following orders .
the other part is using your brain .
throw out the rule book
i like the book .
i like knowing what i can and cannot do .
you' re not the only one who lives for the job .
i want to keep mine for the next 20 or 30 years .
jesus , hart .
give it a rest .
sure , give it a rest .
what are you doing ?
don' t do it .
thank you .
thank you so much .
i can' t believe it !
hi , mom .
don' t do that !
that slow , creepy thing in the shadows .
your father used to do that .
mom .
this isn' t gonna work .
why , of course it' s going to work .
the feds caught the citizen .
we have no one to pin it on !
okay , that was bad luck .
but what about all these other letters from terrorist groups threatening us ?
women' s liberation front .
islamic jihad . " they' re not so nuts about the swimsuit competition .
any one of these could have planted a bomb .
when did we get those ?
i just finished writing them .
just like the citizen letter .
you' re a genius .
no , frank .
i' m just pissed off .
nobody fires me and gets away with it .
they want a newer , hotter show ... ... they' re gonna get it .
mom , you' re a little scary .
and you' re a little bit sloppy .
tuck your shirt .
i don' t want to tell you again .
let' s go home , honey .
mom ?
oops .
need a hand , boss ?
i got it .
okay , vic .
beautify me .
hair , makeup , shellac , whatever it is you do .
that shiny stuff
where are you going ?
your agent mcdonald insists that i depart , or i won' t be compensated .
no .
after the top 10 !
i am completely on my own .
the fbi is gone , it' s not fixed .
i need you !
not anymore .
the cocoon is open .
i' ve taken a woman without a smidgen of estrogen ... ... and made her a lady .
come on .
i' ve never been prouder of myself .
or ... ... of any girl i have ever coached .
you are truly unique .
if i ever had a daughter , i imagine that she would be ... ... something like you .
which is why i never reproduced .
i have a really strong feeling something will happen to these girls .
you need to stay for me .
please .
i can' t .
but i can leave you this .
i was saving it for tonight .
it' s your size , i believe .
good luck to you , gracie lou .
it' s been a privilege .
no insults today ?
you' re a don ho .
has anyone seen gracie ?
i can' t believe she missed dress rehearsal .
maybe she couldn' t take the pressure .
she ate four slices last night .
we all saw her glasses performance .
she is not making the top 10 !
i overslept my beauty sleep .
do you need help ?
no , i' m fine .
i wonder which one of these ... ... is lipstick .
ladies !
good luck , ladies !
keep it moving .
let' s go !
looking good , ladies .
will you go back to the mothership ?
as long as you go with me , tex ass .
let' s go , pennsylvania , new jersey , texas ....

it' s the 75th annual miss united states pageant . .. ... live from san antonio , texas !
good .
that' s the one i use at home .
and your host for the evening , stan fields !
good evening , ladies and gentlemen !
and welcome to a night of beauty , talent and poise .
i' m not just talking about my cohost ... ... kathy morningside !
hello , kathy .
stan , you charmer .
but you forgot to mention " incredible intelligence .
that was incredibly stupid of me .
how can i make it up ?
by helping me to announce the top 10 ... ... chosen based on their performance during the preliminaries this past week .
here' s the envelope .
thank you , scott .
ladies , hold your breath .
hawaii !

and last but not least , rhode island .
and there they are !
this year' s top 10 finalists .
the top 10 have been chosen .
we' il be right back with tonight' s swimsuit competition .
i checked out kathy morningside .
anything ?
not even a traffic ticket .
model citizen .
beauty contestant , pageant director , loving mom .
she' s married ?
widow .
one son .
a sniveling , obsequious weasel of a human being .
you know her son ?
so do you .
it' s frank .
her assistant ?
asshole frank ?
one and the same .
she never mentioned anything .
anything come up on the cch ?
nothing on frank tobin .
there wouldn' t be .
his name is morningside .
he changed it to cover his many indiscretions .
wait .
how do you know that ?
i' ve been around this pageant for many years .
i could shock you with the intimate details i' m privy to .
good job !
good job
i got you something .
i couldn' t
you ate pizza , you stole panties , you' re wild .
we worked on this , remember ?
you' re gonna be great .

federal officer .
i' m with him .
gentlemen , you can' t go in
victor !
he' s with me .
wait .
i' m not " with him " with him .
come on , muffin .
thank you !
she certainly lit my fire .
now you can wear satan' s panties !
hey , hart .
what are you doing here ?
i think you might have been right .
frank is kathy morningside' s son .
disgusting , perverted frank ?
he cleared under another name .
i ran a new cch .
dul , assault , even a weapons charge .
are we doing full deployment ?
mcdonald didn' t want to hear about it .
it' s just us .
good show , mr. tobin .

hey !
you' re drinking my talent !
you got to make it into the top five !
can you whistle ?

i had a girl who rearranged furniture .
you said all i have is sarcasm and a gun .
that and a right hook .
and now , the musical stylings of gracie lou freebush .
good evening .
the program says i' m supposed to play the water glasses for you ... ... but the girls got dehydrated .
no water glasses ?
you want me to go to a commercial ?
no , stay on her .
go with it .
i believe that no woman should be without a basic knowledge of self defense .
so in order to show you this , i' m gonna need a little help .
and i would like to bring out my assistant , eric bob .
more changes ?
follow her .
stay on her .  how to inflict damage with the least amount of force .
in some cases , your attacker might come at you in a frontal assault .
use the heel of your hand and thrust .
this will cause the nose to break and your assailant' s eyes to tear ... ... giving you a chance to get away .
all right .
let' s say your assailant comes at you from behind .
attack me !
little eric looks a little scared .
maybe he needs a little applause .
she' s kicking his ass !
you were the best queen ever .
thank you , that is so sweet .
ladies , give lori some room to breathe .
go on , now .
you need some powder .
you don' t have to hold the crown all night .
my god , that is disgraceful .
frank !
take this to the prop master .
see if you can' t get it to shine .
if all else fails , go for the four sensitive areas of the body .
but just remember to " sing .
s i n g.
solar plexus , instep ... ... nose , groin !
sing .

in a way , america is like a big ship .
when we work together and respect each other ... ... that' s when the ship gets safely home .
terrific answer .
damn it .
new jersey .
as you may know , there are many who consider ... ... the miss united states pageant to be outdated and antifeminist .
what would you say to them ?
oh , my god .
i would have to say , i used to be one of them .
and then i came here ... ... and i realized that ... ... these women are smart , terrific people ... ... who are just trying to make a difference in the world .
we' ve become really good friends .
i know we all secretly hope the other one will trip and fall on her face
wait a minute !
i' ve already done that !
for me , this experience has been one of the most rewarding ... ... and liberating experiences of my life .
my god .
i did it .
and if anyone ... ... anyone ... ... tries to hurt one of my new friends ... ... i would take them out .
i would make them suffer so much , they' d wish they were never born .
and if they ran , i would hunt them down .
thank you , kathy .
a brief , shining moment , and then that mouth .
helps if you pull it out .
good luck , ladies .
i wanted to rub the crown for luck .
frank took it to get it polished .

she' s miss united states
gracie !
she' s miss united states .
okay .
good show , everybody .
i was right in the middle of my song !
you got nothing on me .
this is ridiculous .
where you' re going , they' d love to meet a former beauty queen .
when he says meet , he means m e a t.
miss hart , you don' t understand .
all i' m guilty of is trying to make the world a more beautiful place .
look at yourself .
when i met you , dennis rodman looked better in a dress .
but now you' re a lady !
i did that .
no , vic did that , and a team of highly specialized federal manicurists ... ... and people who make you beautiful .
you know , you' re under arrest , get in the car .
you think you saved something .
all you did was to destroy the dream of young women all over the country .
their dream is to get blown up ?
you got a good shot at that insanity plea .
i earned it !
25 years of bitching beauty queens and what do i get ?
fired !
they steal my life , they steal my beauty pageant .
it is not a beauty pageant .
it is a scholarship program .
yeah , yeah .
yes .
enjoy running the miss san antonio women' s correctional facility pageant !
get it ?
the women' s correctional facility
that was good work .
right back at you .
so , how does it feel ?
throwing the rule book out of the window ?
pretty good , actually .
i was thinking ... ... when we get back ... ... after we write up our reports and you get all ugly again ... ... maybe we could have dinner ?
what ?
you asking me out on a date ?
no .
just a casual dinner .
