23 . 976 dvdrip
in the movvies , dracula wears a cape , and some old english guy always manages to savve the day at the last minute with crosses and holy water .
but evverybody knows the movvies are full of shit .
the truth is it started with blade , and it ended with him .
the rest of us werejust along for the ride .
what' s this chicken scratch ?
it' s cuneiform .
it' s about 4, 000 years old .
so why here ?
because this is the cradle of civilization .
he would' ve been comfortable here .
i don' t know , dan .
this seems like another dead end .
there' s something beneath us .
you find a watch ?
is it a body ?
guys ?
aah !
go !
aah !
what the fuck ? !
aah !
tonight , dr. edgar vance , forensic psychiatrist and author of the new york times bestseller human health ,
the whole being breaktthrough .
also with us , martin vreede , chief of police .
they' il be here for the next hour , and they' il be taking your calls , next on bently tittle livve .
okay , dr. vance .
you are a psychiatrist and a biochemist .
isn' t that true ?
yes , bently .
i am both .
and it' s for a reason .
i have always believed that true health can only be achieved if we reconcile the body and the mind .
and of course , in order to do that , we have to get rid of a lot of old notions .
okay .
and ... how' s that fit in with vampires ?
in the case of vampires , we' re dealing with creatures that , uh , are the repositories of some of our most taboo thoughts .
okay .
predatory rage .
yeah .
sexual sadism .
sexual ?
sexual sadism .
these are very scary subjects for people to own up to , and they' re right inside .
so what you' re saying is we pass the buck onto someone else .
you bet we do .
and vampires ... ?
well , for instance , there' s a hereditary blood disease .
i talk about it in my book .
it' s called porphyria .
and the symptoms of this disease are remarkably similar to classic vampire traits .
the people who suffer from this disease are anemic , they become intolerant to sunlight , they can' t handle garlic ...
garlic ?
chief vreede .
okay .
what' s your take on all these rumors we' ve been hearing about vampires ?
vampires , vampires .
what ?
the only vampires i' m worried about are the ones passing the bar exam .
seriously , though .
if vampires existed , don' t you think we would' ve found them by now ?
the truth is our streets have never been safer .
homicide , assaults , violent crime is down across the board .
if people want to be concerned , they should focus in on characters like this blade criminal .
now , that' s the guy i wanna hear about .
i wanna hear about this character blade .
what about him ?
he' s a sociopath that we' ve been pursuing .
blade is a troubled individual .
i understand that he is under the impression that there is a vast conspiracy of vampires .
now , you' ve got to look at the psychiatric underpinnings of a belief like that .
odds are he believes that he is out there slaying monsters .
but what he' s really doing ...
mm hmm . ... is trying to kill aspects of himself .
aah !
aah !
ah !
aah !
i' m on the stonebridge overpass .
got it .
heading westbound .
i' m just beneath ya .
go !
aah !
aah !
come on !
i got him .
pull !
you all right , man ?
he' s got a gun !
oh , my god !
ouch .
staked you with silver .
why aren' t you ash ?
why aren' t you smarter ?
not a vampire , dumb shit !
set your sorry ass up .
damn .
oh , blade .
what the fuck happen tonight ?
how should i know ?
he was human .
you' re gettin ' reckless , blade .
killing vampires is clean .
they ash ... don' t leave any evidence behind .
killing humans is messy .
you better hope nobody id' d you .
this worked really good .
what' s this ?
a new delivery system for your serum .
it' s an effervescent inhaler .
just bite down on the mouth guard .
delivery' s automatic .
some friends of mine made it .
friends ?
yeah .
you remember those ?
it was horrible .
the one car crashed , and then the guy in the coat was shooting the other guy .
it looked like there was a lot of blood .
thankyou .
that was just a taste of the mayhem that occurred during tonight' s brazen shootout that left at least four people dead .
now , apparently , an anonymous citizen captured the whole evvent on vvideo .
hey , ray .
hey , we got a lead .
let' s catch a plane , wilson .
it' s time to take these cowboys down .
that' s what i' m talkin ' about .
what' s he been doing ?
fuck all .
just feeding .
been through five of them so far .
do you think we have enough security ?
we didn' t capture him .
he allowed us to take him in .
you understand ?
i' m gonna go in .
you shouldn' t have woken me .
we had to .
your blood , your sacrament , can set us free now .
what makes you think i care ?
your people need you .
my people ?
you' re nothing but shadows of your former selves .
look how far you have fallen .
the world' s changed since your time .
the humans have a new hunter .
blade .
and you' d like me to kill him , wouldn' t you ?
yes .
subject is heading west .
got him .
congratulations .
you' re famous .
somebody nailed us .
your face is all over the papers and television .
media' s eatin ' it up .
like i care .
well , you should .
something like this ... taking out a human ... as far as the rest of the world is concerned , you' re public enemy number one .
didn' t know this was a popularity contest .
damn it , blade .
don' t you see what they' re doing ?
they' re waging a goddamn p. r. campaign .
now it' s not just vampires we gotta worry about , we' re gonna have to take on the rest of the world , too .
you worry too much , old man .
that' s why we' re still alive , goddamn it .
i' ve been doing this since before you were born , blade .
you' re like a son to me .
i' m sorry i got old on ya .
i see you alone , surrounded by enemies .
and it breaks my heart .
we can' t win this war alone .
look , he just gave me the evil eye .
come on , man .
what about that guy ? !
bro and prostitute , baby .
so what ?
quit fucking around .
i' m hungry , and i want to eat somebody .
how about him ?
no fatties .
they taste like cheetos .
no , i like him .
wait ... what about that ?
shrunken apple headed bitch .
they fucking saw us over there .
fucking blow me , man !
just pick one already .
jesus christ !
oh , got it !
got it !
baby on board .
oh !
looks like we got ourselves a combo meal !
chicky , chicky , chicky , chicky , chicky !
oh , yeah , baby !
what' s for dinner ?
aah !
hey , pretty lady .
no !
no !
no !
scream if this hurts , chica .
aah !
fuck you ?
aah !
garlic !
scream if this hurts , chica .
aah !
what is it ?
what you were worried about .
let' s go , let' s go , let' s go !
shoot to kill !
aah !
move a finger and you' re dead .
how' s about this one ?
he' s got something in his hand !
get out , blade !
shit !
what' s going on in there ?
somebody talk to me !
aah !
hold it right there !
don' t shoot , don' t shoot .
rise and shine , sleepyhead .
special agents ray cumberland , wilson hale , fbl .
we' ve been tracking you a long time .
mm hmm .
whistler .
dead .
just like all your victims .
say , how many people have you killed , blade ?
thirty ?
forty ?
fifty ?
1, 182 .
but they were all familiars .
people who work with them .
oh .
and by " them , " you mean vampires , right ?
say , so how do you kill these bloodsuckers , tough guy ?
maybe you could give us a few pointers .
you can stake ' em , right ?
what about sunlight ?
i mean , they ain' t feelin ' sunlight , right ?
what about crosses ?
do they still work , wilson , in this day and age ?
i don' t know , ray .
i mean , what if mister homey vampire is , like , jewish ?
that' s a good point .
what about garlic ?
does that work on hindu vampires ?
or do you need , like , saffron or some shit ?
that was quick .
thank you .
you can keep doing your song and dance as long as you want , blade .
it' s not gonna play .
we knowwhat you are .
you' re a stone cold killer .
and you' re sick as fuck .
let' s leave the diagnosis to the professionals .
hello , blade .
my name is dr. vance .
i' ve been charged with giving you a psychiatric evaluation .
gentlemen , would you mind giving us just a couple of minutes alone ?
he' s all yours .
i know you must find this very frightening ... ... but i want you to know that i' m here to help .
and in order for me to do that ,
i' m gonna have to ask you a couple of questions , okay ?
you know , blade ... the darndest thing .
i was signing in at security , and , uh , couldn' t remember the date .
do you knowwhat day it is ?
how about the president ?
you knowwho that is .
who' s in the white house right now ?
an asshole .
i think somebody here wants to talk about vampires .
vampires .
for everyone else , it' s kind of silly .
i had a set of wax teeth when i was seven years old .
it was fun .
i could be somebody else .
but i want to hear you talk about vampires .
what can you tell me about them ?
they exist .
are you one of them ?
sometimes ... the scariest monster of all ... ... is the one in the mirror .
tell me about blood .
when you drink blood , do you ever feel sexually aroused ?
just strikes me that this business of vampirism has a very strong element of sexual confusion .
nuzzling into someone' s neck .
a nocturnal visit .
it promises a ... delicious physical intimacy .
the very sweet taste of saliva ... mixed with skin .
sounds good to me .
where' s it come from ?
that' s what i wanna know .
and i' m starting to wonder what your relationship with your mother was like .
were the two of you very close ?
he' s psychotic .
no shit .
for his safety and for the public' s ,
i' m recommending that he be transferred immediately to county psychiatric ...
fuck that !
that man is my prisoner .
he' s wanted in connection with a laundry list of federal crimes .
hold on , gentlemen .
we' re in my jurisdiction now .
you got a problem with that , you talk to the local magistrate .
that man is my prisoner !
the call has already been made .
don' t fuck with my thing !
there' s a team from the hospital effecting the transfer immediately .
you' re supposed to be working with us on this , chief .
not this time .
this is just a little something to keep you compliant .
the usual dose for this sort of thing is two , three hundred milligrams , but i think with a big , strapping hybrid like yourself ,
i' il kick it up to a couple thousand .
you don' t have a problem with needles , do ya ?
there .
that wasn' t so bad , was it ?
ooh , you' re weak .
in need of your serum .
that must be a bad feeling .
i mean , who would' ve imagined that a mere human like me could overpower you .
you' re one of them .
a familiar .
going on five years now .
it' s the endgame , blade .
all their plans are coming to fruition .
why don' t you just sit back and enjoy the show ?
i hate familiars .
it' s why we' re still alivve , goddamn it .
you' re like a son to me .
sorry i got old on ya .
i see you alone , surrounded by enemies .
it breaks my heart .
hi , blade .
so glad to finally meet you .
i am such a fan .
i like your tattoos .
do they mean anything ?
stupid .
are you okay ?
are you tired ?
you' re weak .
we moved the humans around .
like pawns .
we used them ... ... to flush you out .
you' re not so big .
you' re all alone , blade .
no one' s gonna help you now .
evening , ladies .
hannibal king !
wake up , blade .
this is your rescue .
go !
freeze !
whistler !
this way !
blade !
you' re dead !
get down !
blade .
hey , hey .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa !
where are you going ?
where the fuck is he going ?
this is supposed to be a rescue !
get back , get back !
we' re pinned down .
i can' t shoot around corners .
i can .
aah !
okay .
we' re fucked .
we' re fine .
forgot my sword .
whoo !
come on !
abby .
aah !
we got him .
we' il be there soon .
who the hell are you people ?
well , my name is hannibal king .
and this little hellion right here is abigail .
whistler' s daughter .
i thought the vampires killed whistler' s family .
they did .
i was born later out of wedlock .
when i came of age , i tracked my dad down , and i told him i wanted in .
been doing it ever since .
welcome to the honeycomb hideout .
how do you bankroll this operation ?
i date a lot of older men .
come on , man , i' m joking .
you met dex .
this is hedges .
sommerfield ... she' s the one who built that new serum inhaler of yours .
that runt you saw earlier , that was sommerfield' s daughter zoe .
we call ourselves the nightstalkers .
hmm .
sounds like rejects from a saturday morning cartoon .
we were gonna go with the care bears , but , uh , that was taken .
how many of you are there ?
there' s enough .
we operate in sleeper cells .
when one goes down , another cell activates to pick up the slack .
consider us your reinforcements .
what , you amateurs are supposed to be helping me ?
you ?
look at you .
you' re kids .
you' re not ready to roll with this .
i mean , look at the way you' re dressed .
what , that' s supposed to be tactical ?
what is this ?
what is that ?
fuck you .
it' s a joke , huh ?
what the fuck is wrong with y' all ?
y' all think this is a joke ?
you think this is a fucking sitcom ?
okay , first off , that' s just rude .
second , i' m pretty sure we saved your ass back there .
i' m impressed .
look , blade , my father meant for us to help you .
like it or not , we are all you got .
what the hell makes you think you know about hunting vampires ?
well , here' s for starters .
i used to be one .
do i pass the audition ?
rookies .
fucking hannibal king !
i should' ve ripped his bleeding heart out when i had the chance !
ugh !
ugh !
we had blade .
we had him !
ugh !
and don' t tell me " i told you so , " asher .
what' s wrong , half pint ?
you need a time out ?
blow me .
we got caught with our pants down .
pants down ?
they pretty much fucking ass raped us .
oh , you loved it .
has he been told ?
about your failure ?
yes .
maybe it' s time i joined the game .
you know the kind of woman that just screams trouble ?
you see her and every warning bell in your brain starts going off , but you still manage to ask for her number .
well , that' s all i ever hook up with .
but this betty ...
whoa !
she blew ' em all away in the shitstorm sweepstakes .
her name is danica talos .
you met her earlier .
and unlike typical vampires , her fangs are located in her vagina .
moving on .
the man on her left is her brother asher , and this walking diaper stain is jarko grimwood .
i picked danica up in a bar and spent the next five years playing hide and go suck as her little vampire cabana boy .
eventually , abigail found me .
sommerfield managed to treat me with a cure , and now i kill them .
and that' s basically turning a frown upside down .
we need to pool our resources , blade .
we " ?
yeah , we .
he' s come back .
take a look at this .
you gotta be kidding me .
where' d you guys get this stuff ?
i stole most of it .
danica had a huge collection .
you got stonework , ironwork , weaponry , art .
it' s this stuff that shows up everywhere .
this symbol , this glyph ...
it' s on everything in here .
he is real .
you dig beneath all the ... the myths , all the layers of bullshit that have cluttered our culture for the last 500 years , and eventually you' re gonna strike the truth .
so the movies are true .
the movies are just a comforting fairy tale compared to the real deal .
bram stoker ... he wrote a good yarn , but the events that he described back in 1897 ...
god .
that was just a tiny piece of the mosaic .
the real dracula ... his origins date back much , much earlier than that .
how early ?
try six or seven thousand years .
this is a piece of his armor .
with it , we were able to extrapolate a basic idea of what this fucker looked like .
check this out .
dracula' s only one of the names he' s gone by .
the babylonians worshipped him as dagon , and now they call him drake .
if you believe in the legends , he was born in ancient sumeria .
nobody really knows the specifics of his origin , but we do know this .
he was the first of his kind .
the patriarch of hominus nocturna .
he was born perfect .
and just like the great white shark , this guy has never had to evolve .
forget the movies , forget the books .
there' s no happy ending with this guy .
he' s been there , moving behind the scenes , cutting a bloody fucking path through the ages , until suddenly ... ... just like that ...
... he up and disappeared .
and then we heard a rumor .
the vampires were searching for him .
some say he' d been sleeping through the ages , that he' d retreated from a world he' d become disgusted with .
and according to our information , they found him in iraq about six months ago .
and he was pissed .
don' t try to use my name , that' s fatal
tried to claim my fame , but that' s fatal
about to raise the pain , that' s fatal
tried to claim my fame , but that' s fatal
about to raise the pain , that' s fatal
bite through your jugular vein , that' s fatal
in the window ...
you sell vampire merchandise ?
uh , yeah .
look around .
we might have a few things .
we' ve got dracula lunchboxes .
did you see those ?
there' s bobble heads , key chains .
this is funny .
that garlic gets me evvery time .
we' ve got just about anything .
even vampire vibrators .
here .
check this out .
dra cola .
makes you want to cry , doesn' t it ?
was there something special you needed ?
hey , guy .
she' s talkin ' to ya .
what ?
you wanna kiss me , pretty boy ?
aah !
no !
tried to claim my fame , but that' s fatal
about to raise the pain , that' s fatal
bite through your jugular vein , that' s fatal
aah !
aah !
bite through your jugular vein , that' s fatal
why wake up drake now ?
that' s exactly what we' ve been trying to figure out .
when i was under the fang , there used to be talk about some kind of vampire final solution .
but i could never figure out why they' d want to destroy their food source .
i mean , that makes no sense , right ?
they' ve always had plans for the human race , and it seems likely that whatever they' re cooking up ,
drake' s return is part of it .
let' s face it .
we are fighting a losing battle here .
so we kill a few hundred of them a year ... big deal .
there are thousands of them out there , maybe tens of thousands .
we need a new tactic .
like what ?
a biological weapon .
for you sighted people ... ... here' s a little show and tell .
for the last year , i' ve been working with synthesized dna in order to create an artificial virus targeted specifically at vampires .
we' re calling it daystar .
think about it , blade .
we could wipe ' em all out in one single move .
so what' s been holding you back ?
the lethality in vampires is still spotty .
the bottom line is we need a better strand of dna to work with .
we need dracula' s blood .
because dracula is the progenitor of the vampire race , his dna is still pure .
it hasn' t been diluted by a hundred generations of selective mutation .
we get his blood , we can boost daystar' s viral efficacy to 100 % .
all the vampires go bye bye .
so , can we just go right ahead and sign you up for one of our secret nightstalker decoder rings ?
oh .
holy shit .
um , gentlemen and hottie , uh , we have a wide assortment of ass kickery for your viewing pleasure today .
electronic pistol ... comes in a variety of tasty calibers .
explosive rounds .
yeah , but with a concentrated burst of uvlight instead of your standard hollow points .
i call ' em sun dogs .
hedges .
super size me , sweetheart .
this little pea shooter ... it' s a modified version of the army' s objective individual combat weapon .
pick your poison ... sun dogs , stakes , heat seeking mini rockets .
basically , whatever gets you hard , this puppy' il pump ' em out .
course , it doesn' t have the range of a sword , but ...
oh , god .
over here , we , um ... we call this the uvarc .
whoa .
sorry .
the two points are connected by a powerful uvlaser ...
hedges , i' il take it from here .
yes .
this bad boy is half as hot as the sun .
it can cut through vampires like a knife through butter .
we' re still trying to sort out fact from fiction when it comes to dracula .
turning into mist ?
kinda doubt it .
general shape shifting ?
maybe .
not into a bat or a wolf or anything like that , but another human , with practice , could be possible .
because he wouldn' t have a traditional skeletal structure .
something more like a snake' s , with thousands of tiny bones ...
i have a ...
i have a question about that , hedges .
have you ever been laid ?
many times .
with ladies .
time for a little pressure .
the weakest link in the vampire chain of command has always been their familiars .
since the vampires can' t go out in the daylight , they get the humans to do all their dirty work .
we bleed the wannabes ...
sooner or later , they' il take us right to the real .
i got you some newwheels .
you take care of it now .
she' s making playlists .
she likes to listen to mp3s when she hunts .
it' s like her own internal soundtrack , you know ?
dark core , trip hop , whatever kids are listening to these days .
me , i' m more of a david hasselhoff fan , you know ?
come on , come on like that , ya' il
come on , come on , like that , y' all
let me see you say ho
let me see you say ho
aah !
ah !
aah !
eventually , you know , your head is gonna pop off .
fuck !
no , no !
please , please !
please .
who' s your handler ?
i don' t know my fucking handler .
i swear .
i swear !
oh , shit !
please !
please !
oh , it' s you .
i' il take that .
come on !
let' s go !
come on !
hello ?
hello ?
hello , this is dr. vance .
you paged me .
it' s for you .
yeah , go ahead .
hello ?
aah !
you know , at some point , you , uh , you might want to consider sitting down with somebody .
you know ?
have a little share time ?
kick back ?
get in touch with your inner child ?
that sort of thing ?
also ... just a thought ... but you might wanna consider blinking once in a while .
i' m sorry , i , uh , i ate a lot of sugar today .
hey .
you just can' t walk in here like ... aah !
excuse me , sir .
don' t do that .
where' s vance ?
i' m sorry , but you can' t see dr. vance right now .
sit .
can i , uh , can i help you ?
remember me ?
time for payback .
all right , vance , what the hell do you know ?
oh , jesus .
it' s him .
abby .
it' s drake !
aah !
so , you' re the hunter they all fear .
i had a feeling about you .
just shoot him !
go ahead , blade .
show me what you' re made of .
aah !
23 . 976 dvdrip
aah !
oh , my god !
he got my baby !
aah !
no !
my baby !
ah , careful , daywalker .
i' ve been told about you .
your weakness for humans .
why' d you kill vance ?
he' d outlived his purpose .
he died a good death .
quick , clean .
i wouldn' t know anything about that .
you will .
how are you able to survive in sunlight ?
haven' t you read stoker' s fable ?
i was the first of the vampires .
i am unique .
so that' s why they brought you back .
of course .
they believe through me they could become daywalkers .
look at them down there .
scurrying around like insects .
they don' t know anything about honor or living by the sword , not like you and i do .
do you think they could ever grasp what it means to be immortal ?
you' re not immortal .
i must' ve heard hundreds of you rodents make the same claim .
each one of them have tasted the end of my sword .
perhaps i will too , then , but i think it is more likely the next time we meet , you fall before mine .
catch !
cootchie coo .
did you see that guy ?
we' re gonna lose , man .
we' re gonna ...
oh !
god !
we' re gonna fucking lose !
what did the one lesbian vampire say to the other ?
shut up , king .
see you in 28 days .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa .
hold on .
what are you ... what is that ?
what are you doing ?
it' s an elastic protein , okay ?
it' s gonna stop the hemorrhaging .
okay .
is it gonna hurt ?
yeah , it' s gonna sting a little .
really ?
fuck me !
aah !
i had a family once .
wife , two daughters .
then a drifter came calling one evvening .
a vvampire .
he toyed with ' em fiirst .
tried to make me decide which order they' d die in .
i' vve been doing this a long time .
since before you were born .
i don' t want this life for you , abby .
hey , blade .
i got a question for you .
say we' re successful .
say we wipe out all the vampires .
what then , huh ?
you ever ask yourself that ?
i mean , somehow ,
i ...
i don' t picture you teaching karate at the local y.
he hates me , doesn' t he ?
yeah .
why do you wear that symbol ?
old habits .
i was a good catholic schoolgirl ... ... once .
i was there when they crucified him .
he died for their sins .
not mine .
and what are your sins ?
would you care to confess them ?
take it off .
why ?
i will make you a better one .
there' s an old saying .
kill one man , you' re a murderer ... ... kill a million , a king .
kill ' em all ... ... a god .
why do you do that ?
because there' s something bad inside of me .
this keeps it from getting out .
why can' t you just be nice ?
because the world isn' t nice .
i found where the vampires are working .
biomedica enterprises .
they' ve been buying up all sorts of supplies .
check it out .
taq polymerase , bone marrow growth supplement , genetic sequencing enzymes .
you want a party favor ?
lucky seven .
silver hollow points .
done .
you wanted to see me ?
we' ve got trouble .
doing a little moonlighting , chief ?
shit !
what are you doing here ?
talk .
talk .
spill it !
you knowwhat we' re doing .
what' s inside ?
aah !
now , what' s behind door number one ?
i can' t tell you .
they ... they' il kill me .
kill you ?
motherfucker , i' il kill you .
i' il just enjoy it better .
you know the routine .
lights .
god in heaven .
what is this place ?
it' s a blood farming facility .
vampires decided that hunting humans on a piecemeal basis was ... too inefficient .
why kill your prey when you can keep them alive ?
under optimal conditions , a donor can generate anywhere from 50 to 100 pints of blood .
productive .
where do you get all these people ?
they got processing centers in every major city .
at any given time , there' s what , two , three million homeless wandering around america ?
they just pull ' em in off the streets .
nobody cares about them .
we' re doing this country a service , really .
vampire final solution .
are they aware ?
do they feel anything ?
they' re in a chemical induced coma .
they' re brain dead .
look at this .
this the future you want ?
don' t you think that they have a place for you in their future ?
we don' t have a choice !
they' re going to win .
can' t you see that ?
he' s come back !
there' s nothing stopping them now .

shutdown password ... what is it ?

let' s go .
where' d you go ?
see ?
i turned my back on you .
oh !
you win .
one more , one more .
now , nome king , having never tried to be good , was very bad indeed .
having decided to conquer the land of oz and to destroy the emerald city ...
this ain' t no video game .
this ain' t no video game .
come on , now .
dude , you' re dead .
mom , the lights are weird .
what do you mean ?
they' re going on and off .
guys ?
zoe , i want you to go , and i want you to hide , okay ?
like we talked about .
go on .
zoe ?
get out of here , zoe !
hide !
goddamn it , zoe !
goddamn it !
aah !
aah !
aah !
aah !
something' s not right .
king !
zoe ?
zoe .
zoe ?
whistler .
use it .
use it .
use it .
aah !
back off , pooch .
jesus christ !
what the fuck ? !
good dog .
what the fuck ? !
his name' s pac man .
we' ve been porting the vampire gene into other species ... experimenting .
you made a goddamn vampire pomeranian ?
yeah .
precious , isn' t he ?
well , that depends who you ask , because clearly , this dog has a bigger dick than you .
and when the fuck did you see my dick , fuckface ?
ow !
i was talking to her !
poor king .
you look so distraught !
give me that chair .
you' re tasting a little bland , lover .
are you getting enough fatty acids in your diet ?
have you tried lake trout ?
mackerel ?
how about you take a sugar frosted fuck off the end of my dick ?
and how about everyone here not saying the word " dick " anymore ?
it provokes my envy .
tell us about blade , king .
what' s this weapon he' s been planning ?
i can tell you two things .
one ... your hairdo is ridiculous .
two , i ate a lot of garlic , and i just farted .
silent but deadly .
spit it out , you fucking fruitcake !
all right !
fuck !
i' il tell you about the weapon .
it' s a new flavor crystal formula .
twice the chocolaty goodness , half the calories .
plus , it helps prevent tooth decay .
there .
you' re brave , king .
i' il give you that .
but underneath all that swagger ,
i knowwhat you really fear .
what would hurt you more than anything else .
you don' t want to go back to being one of us , do you ?
i' m gonna bite you again , king .
and i' m gonna leave you here while you turn .
i' m going to watch you day after day as the thirst keeps building and building .
and then , when you can' t stand it anymore ...
... l' m gonna bring the little girl in here ... ... for you to feed on .
would you like that , king ?
would you enjoy taking her life ?
nowwe' re getting somewhere , my pet .
are you all right ?
yeah .
i' il be fine .
don' t let it turn inward .
ever since i can remember , i' ve had this ...
i' ve had this knife of sadness in my heart .
and as long as it' s there , you know , i' m ...
i' m strong .
and i' m ...
i' m untouchable .
but the moment that i take it out ...
... l i' il just die .
he' s one of ours .
my name is caulder .
i' il be your driver this evening .
sommerfield left you a video message .
if you' re watching this , i' m already dead .
if zoe' s alivve , i want you to promise me that you' il take care of her , okay ?
i' vve been reading her the oz books evvery night .
we just started reading the emerald city of oz .
you know , the one with the nome king ?
i think i' vve managed to cultivvate a workable strain of the daystar vvirus .
as a precaution , i transmitted the genetic sequence to caulder in case our main stock was destroyed .
in order for it to achievve maximum lethality , you' re gonna need to interfuse it with drake' s blood .
now , if it works , evvery vvampire in the immediate vvicinity should die almost instantly .
there' s one other thing .
blade , you need to know that there' s a chance the vvirus could destroy you , too .
because you' re a hybrid ,
i ... i' m not sure if your immune system will be able to tolerate it .
i' m sorry .
we just didn' t havve enough time to properly test it .
so , shall we take a look at the plague arrow ?
i only had time to fabricate a small amount of daystar .
however , i was able to outfit it .
a compressed gas projectile ... ... that can be shot from one of the four barrel rifles or a bow .
either way , you must be sure that the shot counts .
you would simply not have enough for a second shot .
do you knowwho i am ?
you' re the nome king .
ah .
the nome king .
how sweet .
tell me , child , do you want to die ?
i' m not afraid .
i' il go to heaven .
there is no heaven .
no god , no angels .
the only thing in your future is nothingness .
but what if you could change that ?
what if you could remain a child forever ?
wouldn' t you like that ?
wouldn' t you accept that gift ?
my friends are coming to kill you .
this blood
wake the night !
it' s gonna wake the night
it' s gonna wake the night
wake the night !
this blood
this blood
it' s gonna wake the night
this blood
this blood
it' s gonna wake the night !
this blood wake the night !
it' s gonna wake the night
this blood wake the night !
wake the night !
this blood
this blood
it' s gonna wake the night !
gonna be sorry you did that .
why ?
nobody' s coming for you , kingshit .
sure they are .
god ...
see , one of the things you fuckheads need to know about us nightstalkers is that when you join our club , you get all sorts of groovy little door prizes .
and one of them is this nifty little tracking node surgically implanted in your body .
bullshit .
yeah .
see , when one of us goes missing ... ... the others , they just dial up the satellite which is in space .
and then presto .
instant cavalry .
you like that , huh ?
go fuck your sister .
okay , king .
where is this tracking node of yours ?
it' s in my left ass check .
fine .
it' s in my right ass cheek .
okay , i' m ... okay , seriously , now .
it' s in the meat of my butt , just below the hello kitty tattoo .
seriously , just pull down my tighty whities and see for yourself .
enough !
it' s not funny anymore !
no , it' s not , you horse humping bitch !
but it will be a few seconds from now .
see , that tickle that you' re feeling in the back of your throat right now ... ... that' s atomized colloidal silver .
it' s being pumped through the building' s air conditioning system , you cock juggling thundercunt !
which means the fat lady should be singing right about now !
this is awkward .
do you have a cell phone ?
um ... a little help here .
are you all right ?
yeah .
where' s zoe ?
drake' s got her .
okay .
thank you .
i brought your toys .
try to keep up .
aah !
abby !
hey .
you okay ?
okay .
let' s get you out of here .
watch out !
fuck me .
oh , fuck me sideways !
oh , yeah .
he' s a cute little guy , aren' t ya ?
good little puppies .
yeah , you' re gonna stay .
you stay .
oh .
there' s a pretty smile .
yeah .
i' m going to , uh ...
hey , dickface .
you seen my dog ?
have you tried the lobby ?
thank you .
fuck ...
come on , king . ... this .
blade .
ready to die ?
i was born ready , motherfucker .
motherfucker .
i like that .
aah !
aah !
aah !
aah !
you broke my arm !
aah !
are you ready to die , motherfucker ?
give it up .
come on .
give it up , king .
give it up .
give it up .
give it up .
hang in there , kitten .
i' il get help .
funny , isn' t it ?
all this time , my people were trying to create a new kind of vampire , when one already exists .
i don' t need to survive .
the future of our race rests with you .
you fought with honor .
i respect that .
allow me a parting gift .
but remember this .
sooner or later , the thirst always wins .
and blade ?
the vvirus didn' t kill him .
because he was a hybrid , his heart nevver stopped beating .
it simply slowed down .
and so he slept , waiting for the moment when he could walk the earth again .
yo , yo
it' s the feast of the blood
unleash the beast within
i walk around with the strength of a hundred men
you best run before i count to ten
blood dripping from my canine like a fountain pen
the shape shifting mirror image flash phototype
the everlasting vision , the red battle type
try to use my name , that' s fatal
tried to claim my fame , but that' s fatal
about to raise the pain , that' s fatal
bite through your jugular vein , that' s fatal
walk with me , come on , walk with me
come on , walk with me , come on , walk with me
come on , walk with me , come on , walk with me
come on , walk with me , walk with me
i strike back with a vengeance , the father , your descendants
and i can' t be deflected by your silver cross pendants
bloody holy water , you made the false images
what' s waiting for the sickle ?
you' re like the nemesis
sting like the scorpion , strike with the force again
my blood in those who revitalize the corpse i' m in
and the last thing , they said the dead would walk again
the blind , deaf and the dumb will talk again
try to use my name , that' s fatal
trying to claim my fame , that' s fatal
about to raise the pain , that' s fatal
bite through your jugular vein , that' s fatal
you don' t even know me
you can' t even see me
friendlier than daylight
now i' m back , now i' m back again
don' t be scared , baby
can' t you see i' m thirsty ?
friends of the daylight
let me drink , let me drink , my friend
don' t be scared , baby
don' t be afraid
friends of the daylight
and i' m back , and i' m back again
never going nowhere
you can' t run from me
day or night , baby
can i drink , can i drink again ?
yeah
yeah
can we drink , can we drink , my friend ?
don' t be scared , baby
don' t be scared , baby
can' t you see i' m thirsty ?
and i' m back , and i' m back again
first things first , man , you can' t fight the thirst
you can' t call the doctor , you can' t call the nurse
you got that louis logo on the side of your purse
and those tight minis about to make me burst
i can' t think , let me sink into your jugular
come have a drink with the thirsty love guzzler
from the dark side , baby , don' t be afraid
you can' t fight the thirst nor escape the plague
i' ve been scopin ' ya hoping you' d be open to
take a sip of the potion ' cause it' s overdue
it' s not your ordinary , it' s a special brew
in the heat of the night , i will rescue you
never going nowhere
you can' t run from me
day or night , baby
can i drink , can i drink again ?
yeah
yeah
can we drink , can we drink , my friend ?
don' t be scared , baby
don' t be scared , baby
can' t you see i' m thirsty ?
and i' m back , and i' m back again
allow me a parting gift .
but remember this .
sooner or later , the thirst will always win .
and i' m back , and i' m back again
