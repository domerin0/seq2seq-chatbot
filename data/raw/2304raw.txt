my name' s marlowe .
the general wanted to see me .
yes , mr. marlowe .
will you come in , please , sir ?
i' il tell the general that you' re here .
thank you .
good morning .
you' re not very tall , are you ?
well , i tried to be .
not bad looking ... ... though you probably know it .
thank you .
what' s your name ?
reilly .
doghouse reilly .
that' s a funny kind of name .
you think so ?
what are you ?
a prizefighter ?
no , i' m a shamus .
what' s that ?
a private detective .
you' re making fun of me .
you' re cute .
the general will see you now , sir .
who' s that ?
miss carmen sternwood .
you ought to wean her .
she' s old enough .
this is mr. marlowe , general .
how do you do , sir ?
sit down , sir .
thank you .
brandy , norris .
how do you like your brandy , sir ?
in a glass .
i used to like mine with champagne .
champagne cold as valley forge ... ... with about three ponies of brandy under it .
come , come , man !
pour a decent one .
i like to see people drink .
that' il do , norris .
you may take off your coat , sir .
thank you .
too hot in here for any man who has any blood in his veins .
you may smoke too .
i can still enjoy the smell of it .
nice state of affairs when a man has to indulge his vices by proxy .
you' re looking , sir , at a very dull survival of a very gaudy life .
crippled , paralyzed in both legs .
little i can eat , and my sleep is so near waking ... ... it' s hardly worth the name .
i seem to exist largely on heat , like a newborn spider .
the orchids are an excuse for the heat .
do you like orchids ?
not particularly .
nasty things .
their flesh is too much like the flesh of men .
their perfume has the rotten sweetness of corruption .
tell me about yourself .
there isn' t much to tell .
i' m 38 .
i went to college .
i can still speak english , when my business demands it .
i worked for the district attorney' s office .
bernie ohls , the chief inspector , said you wanted to see me .
you didn' t like working for the district attorney ?
i was fired for insubordination .
i seem to rate pretty high on that .
i always did , myself .
what do you know about my family ?
well , you' re a widower , a millionaire .
you have two daughters .
one unmarried ... ... and one married to a man named rutledge , but it didn' t take .
both living with you and both ...
go on , sir .
both pretty and both pretty wild .
why' d you want to see me ?
i' m being blackmailed again .
again ?
about a year ago , i paid a man named joe brody $5000 ... ... to let my younger daughter alone .
what does that mean ?
it means , " hm !
it didn' t go through the da or i' d have heard .
who handled it for you ?
shawn regan .
there must be some reason why he isn' t handling it this time .
shawn has left me .
i thought i hadn' t seen him lately .
a month ago , without a word .
i had no claim on him .
i was only his employer .
but i had hoped that he' d come to regard me as something more .
and that at least he' d have said good bye .
that' s what hurt .
you knew him too ?
yes , in the old days when he used to run rum out of mexico ... ... and i was on the other side .
we used to swap shots between drinks ... ... or drinks between shots .
my respects to you , sir .
few men ever swapped more than one shot with shawn regan .
he commanded a brigade in the irish republican army .
but you knew that .
no , i didn' t .
i know he was a good man at whatever he did .
no one was more pleased than i when you took him on as your ... ... whatever he was .
my friend .
my son , almost .
many an hour he sat with me , sweating like a pig ... ... drinking brandy and telling stories of the irish revolution .
well , enough of that .
here .
read the other side .
these her signatures ?
who' s arthur geiger ?
i haven' t the faintest idea .
did you ask her ?
no , and i don' t intend to .
if i did , she' d just suck her thumb and look coy .
i met her in the hall and she did that to me .
then she tried to sit on my lap while i was standing up .
well ?
your other daughter , mrs. rutledge .
she mixed up in this ?
they alike ?
they' re alike only in having the same corrupt blood .
vivian is spoiled , exacting ... ... smart and ruthless .
carmen is still a little child who likes to pull the wings off flies .
i assume they have all the usual vices ... ... besides those they' ve invented for themselves .
if i seem a bit sinister as a parent , mr. marlowe ... ... it' s because my hold on life is too slight ... ... to include any victorian hypocrisy .
i need hardly add that any man who has lived as i have ... ... and who indulges , for the first time , in parenthood at my age ... ... deserves all he gets .
well ?
pay him .
why ?
she signed these notes , didn' t she ?
who' s this joe brody you paid the $5000 to ?
i can' t recall .
my butler , norris , would know .
i think he called himself a gambler .
geiger says these are gambling debts .
they may be .
think they are ?
you want me to take this geiger off your back .
is that right ?
want to know anything ?
i just want to get rid of him .
might cost you a little .
thanks for the drink .
i enjoyed your drink as much as you did , sir .
you' il hear from me .
good luck .
mr. marlowe , mrs. rutledge would like to see you before you leave .
about the money , the general has instructed me ... ... to give you a check for whatever you require .
instructed you how ?
i see , sir .
i forget that you' re a detective .
by the way he rang his bell , sir .
you write his checks ?
i have that privilege .
good for you .
i don' t need any money now ... ... but when i do , i get $ 25 a day and expenses .
how did she know i was here ?
she saw you through the window .
i was obliged to tell her who you were .
i don' t know as i like that .
are you attempting to tell me my duties , sir ?
just having fun trying to guess what they are .
this way , sir .
go right in .
say you' re expected .
thanks .
you wanted to see me ?
so you' re a private detective ?
i didn' t know they existed , except in books .
or else they were greasy men snooping around hotel corridors .
you' re a mess , aren' t you ?
i' m not very tall either .
next time i' il come on stilts , wear a white tie and carry a tennis racket .
i doubt if even that would help .
now , this business of dad' s , think you can handle it for him ?
it shouldn' t be too tough .
i' d have thought it took a little effort .
not too much .
what will your first step be ?
the usual one .
there' s a usual one ?
sure there is .
it comes with diagrams ... ... on page 47 of how to be a detective in ten easy lessons ... ... and your father offered me a drink .
you must' ve read one on being a comedian .
hear what i said about the drink ?
i' m serious .
my father' s ...
i said your father ...
help yourself !
now , look , mr. marlowe , my father' s not well .
i want this case handled with the least worry to him .
that' s the way i was going to handle it .
i see .
no professional secrets ?
i thought you wanted a drink .
i changed my mind .
then what ...
how' d you like dad ?
i liked him .
he liked shawn .
shawn regan .
i suppose you know who he is .
you don' t have to play poker with me .
doesn' t dad want to find him ?
do you ?
of course .
it wasn' t right for him to go off like that .
broke dad' s heart , although he won' t say much .
or did he ?
why don' t you ask him ?
i don' t see what there is to be cagey about .
i don' t like your manners !
i' m not crazy about yours .
i didn' t ask to see you .
i don' t mind if you don' t like my manners .
i don' t either .
i grieve over them evenings .
i don' t mind your drinking your lunch out of a bottle .
but don' t waste your time cross examining me .
people don' t talk to me like that !
do you always think you can handle people ... ... like trained seals ?
i usually get away with it too .
how nice for you !
just what is it you' re afraid of ?
dad didn' t see you about shawn , did he ?
didn' t he ?
could you find him if dad wanted you to ?
maybe .
when did he go ?
about a month back .
drove off one afternoon without saying a word .
they found his car parked in some private garage .
they ?
who' s they ?
dad didn' t tell you .
he told me about regan , but that' s not what he wants to see me about .
that' s what you wanted me to say .
i' m sure i don' t care what you say , mr. marlowe .
i' m wasting your time .
goodbye , mrs. rutledge .
oh , norris .
you made a mistake .
mrs. rutledge didn' t want to see me .
i' m sorry , sir .
i make many mistakes .
did you find what you wanted ?
yes , thanks .
you don' t look like a man who' d be interested in first editions .
i collect blondes in bottles too .
can i be of any assistance ?
would you happen to have a ben hur , 1860 ?
a what ?
do you have a ben hur , 1860 ?
a first edition ?
no , no , the third , the third !
the one with the erratum on page 116 .
i' m afraid not .
how about a chevalier audubon , 1840 , full set ?
not at the moment .
you do sell books ?
what do those look like ?
grapefruit ?
well , they look like books .
maybe i' d better see mr. geiger .
he' s not in just now .
that' s a pity because ...
i said , mr. geiger is not in !
i heard you .
you needn' t yell at me .
i' m late for my lecture on argentine ceramics , so i won' t wait .
the word is " ceramics .
and they ain' t argentine , they' re egyptian !
you did sell a book once , didn' t you ?
i' il run along to the library .
or i could go to that bookstore across the street , couldn' t i ?
do so .
thank you .
is there something i can do for you ?
would you do me a small favor ?
it depends on the favor .
you know geiger' s bookstore ?
i think i may have passed it .
you know geiger by sight ?
what' s he look like ?
wouldn' t it be easier to go and ask to see him ?
i' ve already done that .
i know anything about rare books ?
you could try me .
do you have a ben hur , 1860 , third edition ... ... with a duplicated line on page 116 ?
or a chevalier audubon , 1840 ?
nobody would .
there isn' t one .
the girl in geiger' s bookstore didn' t know that .
i see .
you begin to interest me vaguely .
i' m a private dick on a case .
perhaps i' m asking too much ... ... although it doesn' t seem too much to me .
geiger' s in his early forties ... ... medium height ... ... fattish ... ... soft all over , charlie chan mustache ... ... well dressed ... ... wears a black hat ... ... affects a knowledge of antiques and hasn' t any ... ... and i think his left eye is glass .
you' d make a good cop .
thanks .
going to wait for him to come out ?
they don' t close for another hour or so .
and it' s raining pretty hard .
i got my car and ...
that' s right , it is , isn' t it ?
it just happens i got a bottle of pretty good rye in my pocket .
i' d a lot rather get wet in here .
well !
looks like we' re closed for the rest of the afternoon .
tell me more about this business .
there isn' t much to tell .
what' s the matter ?
i' m just wondering if you have to ...
not necessarily .
little things like that make an ...
hello !
i hate to tell you , but that' s geiger' s car driving up .
who' s the man getting out ?
geiger' s shadow .
his name' s carol lundgren .
thanks .
if you ever want to buy a book ...
a ben hur , 1860 ?
with duplications .
so long .
so long , pal .
you' re cute .
and you' re higher than a kite .
come on , wake up .
i know you .
doghouse reilly .
you' re cute .
what do you know about this ?
mr. geiger , here on the floor .
he' s cute too .
you got a dead man at your feet .
how did it happen ?
you talk a lot , reilly .
come on !
lie down there and be quiet .
all right , reilly .
come on , we' re going .
good evening , sir .
good evening , norris .
i' d like to see general sternwood .
he' s asleep .
what about mrs. rutledge ?
is she .. ?
good evening , mrs. rutledge .
i' ve got your sister outside .
she' s all right .
but she' s not walking very well .
i' il need some help .
are you sure .. ?
yes , she' il be all right in the morning .
did you do this ?
that ?
oh , yes , that' s a little special service ... ... i always provide all my clients .
including being insolent .
where did you find her ?
i didn' t find her .
then how .. ?
i haven' t been here , and she hasn' t been out all evening .
that bad ?
just what did happen ?
you' re fond of your sister .
yes , i am .
do anything for her , wouldn' t you ?
anything .
then drop this .
i still think i should know ...
don' t even ask her .
she never remembers , anyway .
just what did she forget about shawn regan ?
what' d she tell you ?
not half as much as you did .
take it easy .
i don' t slap so good around this time of the evening .
you go too far , marlowe .
harsh words to throw at a man ... ... when he' s walking out of your bedroom .
good night , mrs. rutledge .
thanks , norris .
i' ve put her car away .
if anybody asks , she' s been in all evening .
forget about my being here .
i understand .
may i call a cab ?
it' d be better if you didn' t .
good night .
hello , bernie .
come in .
hello , phil .
don' t you go to bed ?
what you been doing ?
just sitting around .
all evening ?
what is it ?
does it have to be something ?
you' re a friend , but when a man from homicide ... ... just drops in at 2 a. m. , i kind of ...
working on cipher , huh ?
just fooling around .
you' re working for the sternwoods , aren' t you ?
thanks to you .
done anything for them yet ?
i started today .
then the rain came .
all right .
they seem to be a family that things happen to .
there' s a packard belonging to them ... ... washing around in the surf off lido pier .
and there' s a guy in it .
could it be regan ?
who ?
shawn regan .
that irish ex legger old sternwood hired ... ... to do his drinking for him ?
what would he be doing down there ?
what would anybody be doing down there ?
that' s what i' m going to lido to find out .
want to come ?
yeah , i do .
how' s the weather ?
clearing up .
what time did that call come in ?
about 15 minutes ago .
what kind of car you say it was ?
packard .
hello , bernie .
hi , ed .
you got him out .
who is he ?
owen taylor .
sternwood' s chauffeur , according to his license .
what' s the story ?
you can see it from here .
there' s where he went through the railing .
the rain stopped here about 9 p. m.
the broken rails are dry inside .
that would put it about 9 : 30 .
let' s have it , doc .
his neck' s broken and something hit him across the temple .
what made the bruise ?
steering wheel ?
whatever it was , it was covered .
the wound had bled under the skin while he was alive .
blackjack ?
could be .
bernie , funny thing .
the hand throttle is set halfway down .
thanks , jim .
so long , doc .
all right , boys .
take him away .
could be drunk or a suicide .
yeah , but it isn' t .
you know anything about owen taylor ?
only that a few sternwood chauffeurs ... ... lost their jobs on account of the younger daughter , carmen .
tell me what you' re working on , phil .
they told me blackmail .
who were they after ?
carmen ?
this doesn' t look like the way you' d handle it .
you know , i got a feeling that ...
me ?
i didn' t do this .
what were you going to say , phil ?
give me another day , bernie .
i may have something for you .
okay .
let' s go home .
good morning .
you do get up .
i was thinking ... ... you worked in bed , like marcel proust .
who' s he ?
a french writer .
come into my boudoir .
you don' t put on a front .
not much money in this work if you' re honest .
are you honest ?
we' re going to start that again ?
i' m sorry .
also , about yesterday .
perhaps i was rude .
we were both rude .
you want to see me about taylor ?
so you know about that ?
poor owen .
the da' s man took me down to lido .
he knew more about it than i did .
he knew owen taylor wanted to marry your sister .
perhaps it wouldn' t have been a bad idea .
you see , he was in love with her .
but i didn' t come here about owen .
you still can' t tell me what my father wants you to do ?
not without his permission .
you can' t even tell me if it was about carmen ?
you better look at this .
a messenger brought it today .
eight thirty five .
that' s right .
she takes a nice picture .
they want 5000 for the negative and prints .
the demand came how ?
a woman telephoned me after it was delivered .
what else ?
there has to be something else ?
this thing isn' t worth $5000 to anybody .
they think it is .
why ?
she said if they didn' t get the money today ... ... i' d be talking to my sister through a wire screen .
she said there was a police jam connected with it .
what kind of a jam ?
i don' t know .
you know where this picture was taken ?
i haven' t the slightest idea .
or when ?
talk to carmen about it ?
she was asleep when i left .
figure out a story ?
norris fixed that .
how ?
she was in all evening .
police checked when they called about owen .
go ahead and scratch .
what was owen doing with your car last night ?
nobody knows .
he took it without permission .
why ?
you think ...
that he knew about this picture ?
i don' t rule him out .
outside of what the woman said ... ... you don' t know why they want $5000 for it ?
that' s why i came to you .
there' s five fingers on a glove .
why didn' t you go to the police ?
you were afraid they' d find something i couldn' t sit on .
then where would the sternwoods be ?
may i use your phone , mr. marlowe ?
police headquarters , please .
hello , this is mrs ...
hello .
what do you want , please ?
what ?
i called you ?
say , who is this ?
sergeant reilly ?
there isn' t any sergeant reilly here .
wait a minute .
you' d better talk to my mother .
hello .
who' s this ?
the police ?
this isn' t a police station .
if you know it , why did ...
look , this is not a police station !
what was that you said ?
my father should hear this .
hello .
who is this ?
yeah , but she just told you that ...
you' re the police !
he' s the police .
well , that' s different .
what can i do for you ?
i can do what ?
where ?
oh , no !
i wouldn' t like that , and neither would my daughter .
i hope the sergeant never traces that call .
you like to play games , don' t you ?
why did you stop me phoning ?
because i' m working for your father .
or because i think i' m beginning to like another one of the sternwoods .
i prefer the second reason .
well , let' s get back to business .
have you got $5000 in cash ?
can you get it ?
i think so .
where from , your father ?
i' d rather not .
where would you get it ?
well , from eddie mars .
the gambler ?
that explains why you haven' t got $5000 in cash .
i like gambling .
so do i.
how do you know he' il give it to you ?
i can get the money .
i' ve been a good customer of eddie mars ' .
there' s a bond between mr. mars and the sternwoods .
you see , shawn regan ran off with eddie' s wife .
that doesn' t interest you ?
it might make it easier for me to find him .
if i were looking for him .
is regan mixed up in this ?
no .
shawn' s not in any cheap blackmailing scheme .
i' m glad you said that .
do you want to tell me now ?
tell you what ?
what you' re trying to find out .
you know , it' s a funny thing .
you' re trying to find out why i was hired .
and i' m trying to find out why you ...
you could go on forever , couldn' t you ?
it' il give us something to talk about next time .
among other things .
oh , mrs. rutledge .
you wanted me to do something about this , didn' t you ?
that call , how' d you leave it ?
she' s to call me at 6 p . m .
with instructions .
phone me when you' ve heard from her .
as long as you' re going to pay $5000 for these ... ... you' d better take this .
goodbye , mr. marlowe .
well , it wasn' t intentional .
try it sometime .
i' m back again .
remember me ?
i' m afraid i ...
do you remember me now ?
now , see here !
that was only a stall about those first editions .
i got something to sell .
something geiger wants .
is he in ?
no , he isn' t .
you might come back tomorrow ...
drop the veil .
i' m in the business myself .
is he sick ?
i could go to his house .
no , that wouldn' t do .
if you' d come back tomorrow ...
say , agnes , you ...
come on , carol .
hurry up , will you ?
perhaps ...
his name' s lundgren , isn' t it ?
what do you want ?
who' s the other guy ?
you' d better come tomorrow .
in the morning ?
early ?
because it looks like you' re moving today .
all right , driver .
let' s go !
around the corner , then take it easy .
where are we going ?
follow a car .
a tail job .
i' m your girl , bud .
it wouldn' t be bad .
that station wagon coming out of the alley .
that' s the one .
here you are , sugar .
buy yourself a cigar .
if you can use me again sometime , call this number .
day and night ?
night' s better .
i work during the day .
what are you ...
remember me ?
i' m doghouse reilly .
the man that didn' t grow very tall .
what' s the matter , couldn' t you get in the house ?
come on .
i' ve got a key .
where' d you leave your car ?
around in back .
looking for something ?
how much do you remember about last night ?
remember what ?
i was sick last night , i was home .
before you went home .
in that chair there .
you remember , all right .
quit your stalling and stop biting your thumb !
were you the one who was here ?
how much do you remember ?
are you the police ?
no , i' m a friend of your father' s .
who killed geiger ?
who else knows about it ?
what , that he' s dead ?
i don' t know .
not the cops , or they' d be camping here .
was it joe brody ?
joe brody .
who' s he ?
i don' t know how much trouble you' re used to ... ... but i hope you' ve had plenty of practice dodging it .
did brody kill him ?
i kill who ?
yes , joe did it .
he did ?
why ?
i don' t know .
but you' re ready to tell the police he did it ?
that is , if we can get the photograph .
you mean .. ?
it' s gone .
i looked for it .
brody took it with him .
i' ve got to go home now .
i wouldn' t say anything to the police about brody just yet .
i wouldn' t say anything about anything .
that you were ever here .
not even to your sister .
just leave it to reilly .
your name isn' t reilly ...
excuse the casual entrance .
the bell didn' t answer .
mr. geiger around ?
we don' t know where he is .
we found the door open and just stepped in .
friends of his ?
business .
we dropped in for a book .
any message if he comes back ?
no , i don' t think so .
we won' t bother you .
just a minute .
the girl can go .
i' d like to talk to you .
suppose i don' t want to talk to you ?
i' ve got two boys out in the car .
it' s like that , eh ?
run along , angel .
your story sounds wrong .
that' s too bad .
got a better one ?
maybe i can find one .
blood .
quite a lot of blood .
is that so ?
do you mind ?
no , i' m used to it .
i think we' il let the police in on this .
we' il have some law ...
yeah .
why not ?
who are you , soldier ?
marlowe .
i' m a private detective .
who' s the girl ?
a client .
geiger tried to throw a loop on her .
we came to talk .
convenient , the door being open .
wasn' t it ?
how' d you have a key ?
that your business ?
could be .
i could make yours mine .
you wouldn' t like it .
the pay' s too small .
all right , i own this house .
geiger' s my tenant .
now what do you think of it ?
you know some nice people .
i take them as they come .
got any good ideas ?
one or two .
somebody gunned geiger .
or somebody got gunned by geiger who ran away .
or he had meat for dinner and likes to butcher in the parlor .
no , i don' t like it either .
maybe you' d better call downtown .
i don' t get it .
i don' t get your game .
don' t you , mr. mars ?
wondered why you didn' t ask me who i was .
you' re telling me geiger was in a racket of some kind .
what racket ?
i wouldn' t know .
but i' il tell you something you missed .
somebody cleaned out geiger' s store today .
you talk too much .
you really got those boys outside ?
open the door .
open it yourself .
i already got a client .
it' s all right .
just proving something .
while you' re here , look him over .
pardon me .
who is he ?
philip marlowe , hobart arms , franklin street .
special license , deputy badge and all .
all right , outside .
a shamus .
the man said , outside .
he said that .
that' s what the man said .
he kills me .
is he any good ?
who ?
sidney ?
he' s company for pete .
all right , talk .
not to you .
i already got a client .
who cleaned out geiger' s store ?
lots of weather we' re having .
did it rain at las olindas ?
i might make it worth your while .
i might make it worth yours .
what do you care who cleaned out geiger' s store ?
i could make you talk .
it' s been tried .
and ?
why don' t you call the cops ?
i think you' d better get out of here .
by the way , how' s mrs. mars these days ?
you take chances , marlowe .
i get paid to .
mrs. rutledge .
i' ve been waiting to hear from you .
i' m sorry .
i have nothing to tell you .
she didn' t call ?
no , she didn' t .
did you get the money , in case she does ?
i have the money .
i' il get in touch with you as soon as she calls .
all right , i' il stay right here until you call .
geiger ?
you said what ?
arthur geiger .
the guy with the blackmail racket .
i don' t know anybody by that name .
you' re joe brody ?
so what ?
so you' re joe brody .
and you don' t know geiger .
that' s very funny .
you' ve got a funny sense of humor .
take it somewhere else .
joe , you got geiger' s stuff .
i got his sucker list .
don' t you think we ought to talk ?
now !
all right .
if you think you got something .
you alone , joe ?
except for this .
my , my , such a lot of guns around town and so few brains .
you' re the second guy today that thinks ... ... a gat in the hand means the world by the tail .
put it down , joe .
the other guy was eddie mars .
you ever hear of him ?
if he gets wise to where you were last night , you' il hear of him .
what would i be to eddie mars ?
i don' t know if you don' t .
look , don' t get me wrong .
i' m not a tough guy .
just careful .
you' re not careful enough .
that play with geiger' s stuff was terrible .
don' t kid yourself i won' t use this if i have to .
what' s your story ?
why don' t you ask your friend to come out ?
she must get tired of holding her breath .
come on out , agnes .
hello , sugar .
i knew you were trouble .
i told joe ...
ask mrs. rutledge to come out too .
what did you come for ?
why' d you lie to me ?
i don' t need you .
i keep out of it !
i don' t want you here .
will you get out ?
but he won' t let me .
he' s curious , bothered and wondering .
you bet i' m wondering and i' il find out .
sit down .
stop waving that gun .
i didn' t do anything .
can' t you talk without that ?
don' t argue with the man .
you' re ruining things .
i' m not .
if you' d ...
say , look !
what are you up here for ?
to keep her from paying you off , and to take the cops off your neck .
what cops ?
the cops that want to know where the lead in geiger came from .
look , joe , you shot geiger .
i didn' t know ...
the cops don' t yet .
but he wasn' t alone when you shot him .
either you didn' t notice that or you got scared and ran away .
but you had nerve enough to take the film .
and you had nerve enough to come back and hide the body .
you' re crazy !
shut up !
so you could clean out the store ... ... before the law knew there was a murder .
you take chances .
it' s lucky for you i didn' t shoot geiger .
but you can step off for it anyway .
you' re made to order for the rap .
you think you' ve got me ?
positive .
how come ?
i told you , there was a witness .
now don' t go simple on me .
you mean carmen .
she' d say anything .
so you have got that picture .
i guess you think i' m dumb .
just average , for a grafter .
you see , either you were there last night ... ... or you got the picture from somebody who was .
you knew carmen was there ... ... because you had your girlfriend threaten mrs. rutledge .
the only way you could have known was by being there ... ... and seeing what happened .
or having the picture .
make sense ?
who are you ?
a guy who gets paid to do people' s laundry .
and all i' il get out of it is that picture .
how about some dough ?
i' m down to nickels .
not from my client .
get the picture , joe .
stay right there .
here .
watch him .
take it easy .
i want my picture .
now ...
i want my picture .
you shot geiger .
hold it !
get up .
you look like a pekinese .
and since i' m collecting guns ...
sit down , sugar .
now where were we ?
oh , yes , you were just about to get something .
there better not be any more prints .
there won' t be .
can i have my picture now ?
can i have my gun ?
later .
you' re cute .
i like you .
this is nothing .
i got a balinese dancing girl tattooed on my chest .
you better take her home .
i suppose i should thank you .
no , just don' t lie to me next time .
come on , carmen .
hold it , joe .
you got off easy , joe .
what' s the matter , sugar ?
he gives me a pain ...
goes for me too .
you got your pictures .
get out .
where' s the pain ?
in my ...
get out !
not yet .
we got a few things to straighten out .
i told you to get out .
what difference does it make now ?
why' d you put the bee on mrs. rutledge ?
i tapped the old man six months ago .
i figured it might not work twice .
what made you think mrs. rutledge wouldn' t tell him ?
how well do you know her ?
we' il pass that .
i figured she might have a thing or two she wouldn' t want him to know .
that' s a little weak , but we' il pass that too .
say , joe , how' d you get that picture ?
you got what you came for , and you got it cheap .
i don' t know anything about it .
do i , agnes ?
but you just gave it to me .
a half smart guy .
that' s what i always draw .
never once a man who' s smart all the way around the course .
never once .
did i hurt you much ?
you and every other man .
where' d you get that picture ?
it fell out of somebody' s pocket .
got an alibi for last night ?
i was here with agnes .
that' s a great witness .
you can only die once , even for a couple of murders .
a couple of murders ?
i mean two murders .
where were you about 7 : 30 last night ?
where were you ?
all right , i was watching geiger' s place .
why ?
to get something on him .
look at me while you' re talking .
it was raining hard and i was in my car .
there was a car out front and another down the hill .
i was in back .
who else was back there ?
nobody .
there was a big packard near where i was , so i took a look .
it was registered to the sternwoods .
nothing happened , so i got tired of waiting and i went home .
i know where that packard is now ?
it' s in the sheriff' s garage .
it was fished out of 12 feet of water off lido pier this morning .
there was a dead man in it .
it was pointed toward the end of the pier and the throttle pulled out .
you can' t pin that on me .
i can try .
sit down , joe .
the dead man was owen taylor , sternwood' s chauffeur .
he went up to geiger' s because he was sweet on carmen .
he didn' t like the games geiger was playing .
he let himself in the back with a jimmy and he had a gun .
the gun went off , as guns will , and geiger fell down dead .
owen ran with the film .
you went after him and got it .
all right , you' re right .
i heard the shots ... ... and saw him run out and enter the packard and away .
i followed him .
he turned west on sunset .
and beyond beverly ... ... he skidded off the road and came to a stop .
so i came up and played copper .
he had a gun .
he was rattled , so i sapped him down .
i figured the film might be worth something , so i took it .
that' s the last i saw of him .
so you left an unconscious man in a car way out near beverly .
and you want me to believe somebody came along ... ... ran that car to the ocean , pushed it off the pier ... ... then hid geiger' s body ?
well , i didn' t ...
somebody did .
you wanted time to take over .
you can' t prove i did it .
i don' t particularly want to .
all i want to do is find out what geiger had on the sternwoods .
maybe you and i can make a little deal .
go ahead .
maybe she' s back .
if she is , she hasn' t got her gun .
you got a match , bud ?
what will it be , kid ?
me or the cops ?
what do you want ?
sit in that car , back of the wheel .
you drive .
as soon as this police car goes by , we' re going to geiger' s house .
by the way , carol , you shot the wrong guy .
brody didn' t kill geiger .
all right , let' s go .
you got a key .
let' s go in .
who said i got a key ?
all right , come on !
maybe you need this .
hello .
hello , bernie ?
is this who i think it is ?
it' s marlowe .
how are you fixed for red points ?
i haven' t got any .
who has ?
i got some cold meat set out , might interest you .
what are you talking about ?
you boys find a gun on owen taylor ... ... when they fished him out of the drink last night ?
that' s police business .
i know it' s police business .
but if they did , it had three empty shells in it .
you come up to 7244 laverne terrace ... ... off laurel canyon road , and i' il show you where the slugs went .
i' il be right out .
i' il be waiting for you .
what did you hide geiger' s body for ?
do you admit shooting brody ?
take a jump , jack .
he doesn' t have to admit it .
here' s his gun .
i' m late .
i' m sorry .
how are you today ?
better than last night .
i can agree on that .
hello , max .
good afternoon .
got a table for us ?
certainly , madam .
this way , please .
i' il have a scotch , mixed .
a scotch and plain water .
how' d you happen to pick out this place ?
maybe i wanted to hold your hand .
that can be arranged .
why' d you want to see me ?
my father was very pleased when he saw the morning papers .
so was i.
we were lucky .
i managed to keep the sternwoods out of it .
he hopes you didn' t involve yourself too deeply .
you tell him it was no fault of yours ?
no .
he asked me to give you a check .
i don' t need any money yet .
he considers the case closed .
it is , isn' t it ?
as far as geiger is concerned , yes .
then it' s completely closed .
i hope this is satisfactory .
five hundred !
it' s a lot more than i expected , but welcome just the same .
we' re very grateful to you , mr. marlowe , and ... ... i' m very glad it' s all over .
tell me , what do you do when you' re not working ?
play the horses , fool around .
no women ?
i' m generally working on something , most of the time .
could that be stretched to include me ?
i like you .
i told you that before .
i liked hearing you say it .
but you didn' t do much about it .
neither did you .
speaking of horses , i like to play them myself .
but i like to see them work out a little first .
see if they' re front runners or come from behind .
find out what their whole card is .
what makes them run .
find out mine ?
i think so .
go ahead .
i' d say you don' t like to be rated .
you like to get out in front ... ... open up a lead ... ... take a little breather in the backstretch ... ... and then come home free .
you don' t like to be rated yourself .
i haven' t met anyone yet that could do it .
any suggestions ?
i can' t tell till i' ve seen you over a distance of ground .
you got a touch of class , but i don' t know how far you can go .
a lot depends on who' s in the saddle .
go ahead , marlowe , i like the way you work .
in case you don' t know it , you' re doing all right .
there' s one thing i can' t figure out .
what makes me run ?
i' il give you a little hint .
sugar won' t work .
it' s been tried .
what did you try it on me for ?
who told you to sugar me off this case ?
was it eddie mars ?
all right , don' t answer me .
but your father didn' t tell you to pay me off , did he ?
no .
he' s not well .
i used my own judgment .
are you sure ?
i know it hasn' t worked so well up till now .
what' s eddie mars got to do with this case ?
nothing .
he runs a gambling house .
i play horses .
i play the wheel .
you' re playing something else too .
never mind talking .
let me do it .
did you know shawn regan was supposed to run off with mars ' wife ?
who doesn' t ?
did you know he owned the house and was mixed up in that racket too ?
i don' t believe ...
then why does it bother you so much ?
what' s eddie mars got on you ?
come now , angel .
stop shaking .
i don' t want to hurt you , i' m trying to help you .
you better run along .
but you made a deal and you' re going to stick to it , right or wrong .
we' il take up the question of you and i when the race is over .
the only trouble is , we could' ve ...
pardon me ?
the only trouble is , we could have had a lot of fun ... ... if you weren' t a detective .
we still can .
so long , marlowe .
waiter ?
sir ?
have you got a phone ?
over there .
deposit 55 cents , sir .
how much is that ?
55 cents .
here' s your party , sir .
hello ?
hello !
may i speak with mr. mars , please ?
this is mars .
i didn' t recognize your voice .
this is marlowe .
i want to see you .
sure .
when ?
i' d like to drive up this evening .
come ahead .
mr. mars around ?
i' m marlowe .
he' s expecting me .
wait here and i' il find out .
he would spend it on the ponies
he would spend it on the girls
buy his mother lovely roses
for her dear old hennaed curls
but when his wife said " sweetie ... ... what did you get for me ?
he socked her in the choppers
such a sweet , sweet guy was he
and her tears flowed like wine
she' s a real sad tomato
she' s a busted valentine
knows her mama done told her
that a man is darned unkind
i' m a telling you , mister
she was a sob , sob sister
lying on a pillow
weeping like a willow
my , oh my , how that baby could cry
and her tears flowed like wine
yes , her tears flowed like wine
hello , boys .
stop it !
he' s waiting to see you .
thanks .
hello , eddie .
hello , marlowe .
glad you came .
you never been here before ?
my first time .
i wouldn' t be here now ... ... if you hadn' t told me i could come up here if i needed help .
drink ?
i like the way you' ve handled this whole thing .
it made me sore at first , but i see now you knew what you were doing .
you and i could get along .
i like to pay my bills as i go .
how much do i owe you ?
for what ?
still careful , huh ?
all right , then .
i want some information ... ... about shawn regan .
you got that already from the bureau of missing persons .
you get around .
my boys do .
where is he ?
i haven' t any idea .
you didn' t bump him off , did you ?
no .
you think i did ?
that' s what i came here to ask you .
you' re kidding ?
all right , i' m kidding .
you didn' t do it and your boys aren' t good enough to .
i used to know regan .
i thought you told me you weren' t looking for regan .
i wasn' t then .
maybe i just got curious .
i finally got it through my skull that the general was worried ... ... regan might be mixed up in this blackmail business .
sternwood can turn over now and go back to sleep .
it was geiger' s own racket .
i did some inquiring myself today .
when geiger and brody got gunned , that washed the whole thing up .
that , i' m sure of .
it' s finished then .
the general thinks like you do .
he paid me off today .
i' m sorry to hear that .
i wish he' d hire you to keep that daughter of his home .
she' s out there now .
i know , i heard her .
she' s not very popular here .
when she loses , she doubles and i wind up with a fistful of paper .
if she wins , she takes my money home .
don' t you get it back next time ?
she spends it somewhere else .
oh , she goes on the cuff .
i' d keep her out of here then .
i took the trip for nothing .
sorry i can' t help you .
you mind if i look the place over before i go back ?
go ahead .
take that door , it comes out behind the tables .
no , thanks .
i' il go out with the other suckers .
maybe someday i can do you a real favor .
maybe .
there' s one thing that puzzles me .
you don' t seem in a hurry to find that wife of yours .
i hear she' s not the kind of wife a guy wants to lose .
could it be you know where she is , and maybe regan too ?
stop being curious .
what' s between me and my wife is between us .
sorry .
oh , eddie , you don' t have anybody watching me , do you ?
tailing me in a gray plymouth coupe ?
no .
why should i ?
i can' t imagine , unless you' re worried about where i am all the time .
i don' t like you that well .
so long , eddie .
mr. marlowe ?
mr. marlowe ?
mrs. rut ...
mrs. rut ...
you better take it .
mrs. rutledge asked if you' d look her up before you went .
she' s at the center table .
thank you both .
mr. marlowe ?
mrs. rutle ...
mrs. rutledge wants to see me .
how did you know ?
he told me .
she sure is picking them tonight .
she won eight bets in a row .
i didn' t hear him tell you anything .
he didn' t .
what kind of game is this ?
spin the wheel .
i want another play .
i' m sorry .
you have more than $ 14, 000 there ... ... and the table cannot cover your bet !
it' s your money .
don' t you want it back ?
i sent for mr. mars .
look , lady , you know ...
do you want to cover it ?
hello , marlowe .
hello .
the lady .
something the matter , mrs. rutledge ?
i' d like one more play .
all this on the red .
cover her bet in even thousands .
if no one objects to this turn of the wheel being for the lady alone .
wish me luck , marlowe .
you wanted to see me .
the people i came with want to stay ... ... so i thought maybe you' d like to drive me home .
sure .
are you ready , lady ?
yeah , i' m ready .
so am i.
number five , red !
you did all right .
i' il get my car while you collect ... ... and meet you outside .
good night .
this is a gun , lady .
i want that money .
yell , and i' il cut you in half !
give me that bag !
hello , pal !
easy !
somebody' s always giving me guns .
you can turn around now .
i don' t like people who play games .
tell your boss ... ... when you wake up .
i' m glad i asked you to take me home .
so am i.
shall we go now ?
why are you trembling ?
don' t tell me you were scared .
i won' t believe it .
i' m not used to being hijacked .
give me a little time .
hijacked ?
is that what it was ?
what else ?
you' re still shaking .
what' s the matter ?
you weren' t worried about me ?
afraid i' d get hurt ?
when did you begin to feel that way about me ?
why are we stopping ?
to settle something .
all right ... ... let' s begin with what eddie mars has on you .
if he had anything , would it be any of your business ?
you' ve already been paid , haven' t you ?
yeah , by you .
are you after more money ?
i guess you' ve got a right to ask .
no , i' ve already been well paid .
i' ve got another reason .
you like my father , don' t you ?
why don' t you stop ?
remember i said i was beginning to like another sternwood ?
i wish you' d show it .
that should be awful easy .
i liked that .
i' d like more .
that' s even better .
all right .
now that' s settled .
what' s eddie mars got on you ?
so that' s the way it is .
that' s the way it is .
i kissing you is all right .
i' d like to do more of it .
but first i want to find out what eddie mars has on you .
if you say that again ...
i' il keep saying it till i find out .
i told eddie mars i was coming up to see him .
when i arrived , you were there .
you two staged an act .
he let you win a lot of money ... ... and then sent a man to take it away from you ... ... to prove there was nothing between you .
you' re shaking again .
take me home .
sure i will .
but first , open that bag .
if there' s 28 grand in it , i' il eat every word i' ve said .
open it and make a sap out of me or else stop playing me for one .
take me home .
all right , but that' s as far as i' il carry you .
from now on , you can take care of yourself .
what does the hat check girl get for a tip ?
i' m trying to think of something appropriate .
how' d you get in here ?
bet you can' t guess .
i' il bet i can .
you came in through the keyhole , like peter pan .
who' s he ?
a guy i used to know around a poolroom .
you' re cute .
i' m getting cuter every minute .
how did you get in ?
i showed the manager your card .
i stole it from vivian .
i told him you said to come up and wait .
i want ...
see , i remembered .
what do you remember about shawn regan ?
i didn' t like him .
yeah , why ?
he didn' t pay any more attention to me than you do .
treated me like a baby all the time .
how' s eddie mars treat you ?
i don' t know him .
you sure ?
you know who he is , don' t you ?
he' s always calling vivian up .
why ?
is he cute ?
i think you' re telling the truth , for a change .
is he as cute as you are ?
nobody is .
i' ve had a long day .
you' d better be going .
come on , carmen .
i don' t want to .
you can' t ...
shut up !
hello , phil ?
hello , bernie .
what' s up ?
i want to see you down here , right away .
i just woke up .
i haven' t had breakfast .
it' s 2 : 00 .
if you' re not here in 30 minutes you' il be eating on the county .
i' d rather buy my own .
i know that food the county puts out .
all right , i' il be there .
don' t you know better than to wake a man at 2 p . m ?
what' s up ?
i got some orders for you .
you' re to lay off the sternwood case .
who says so ?
the da
the da , huh ?
he must have changed his mind .
who changed it for him ?
general sternwood .
personally ?
all right .
between you and me , he didn' t talk to the general .
he talked to the daughter , mrs. rutledge .
any reason given ?
not that i know of .
there' s no law says a man can' t work on a case without a client .
you know , just to keep his hand in .
i' m just supposed to tell you to lay off .
i know , you just work here .
put yourself in my shoes for a minute .
a nice old guy has two daughters .
one of them is " wonderful .
the other is not so wonderful .
as a result , somebody gets something on her .
the father hires me to pay off ... ... but before i can , the family chauffeur kills him .
but that didn' t stop things .
it just starts them .
and two murders later , i find out somebody' s got something on " wonderful .
who' s somebody ?
i think it' s eddie mars .
why ?
for one thing , he owns the house geiger was killed in .
he did .
the day after the murder , he transfers the deed to a dummy .
what have you got that hooks mars up with mrs. rutledge ?
last night , the two of them ... ... i don' t want to bore you with the whole story ... ... but they went to the moon to prove there was nothing between them .
i think there is , and it' s got something to do with shawn regan .
who' s missing and supposed to have run off with eddie mars ' wife ?
what does the general think about all this ?
i don' t know .
wonderful " won' t let me get to him .
you still want me to lay off ?
the da does , but you do all right following your own hunches .
thanks , bernie .
i' m going out to get breakfast .
you want a cup of coffee ?
i can' t afford to be seen with you .
so long , bernie .
sternwood residence .
hello , norris ?
this is marlowe .
yes , mr. marlowe .
i ...
i' d like to come out and see general sternwood .
i don' t think it would be possible tonight .
why not ?
i' ve been trying to call you .
mrs. rutledge is very anxious to talk to you .
if you' il wait just a minute , i' il put her on .
hey , sugar , you got a match ?
sure thing .
hello , marlowe ?
thanks .
hello , mrs. rutledge .
i wanted to tell you you can stop worrying ... ... and call off your bloodhounds .
we found shawn .
what' s that ?
you' ve found shawn ?
yes .
he' s been in mexico .
he hasn' t been very well .
what happened ?
an accident of some kind .
we didn' t get all the details .
i' m leaving at once to meet him .
i see .
i suppose the general' s quite pleased .
we haven' t told him yet .
we thought it best to wait .
thanks for telling me .
have a nice trip .
i will .
goodbye .
goodbye .
say , mister ... ... would you please ...
this is just our way of saying , " lay off .
you the guy that' s been tailing me ?
yeah .
my name' s jones .
harry jones .
i want to see you .
swell !
did you want to see those guys jump me ?
i didn' t care one way or the other .
you could' ve yelled for help .
a guy' s playing a hand , i let him play it .
i' m no kibitzer .
you got brains .
get my hat , will you ?
help me up to my office .
that working over they gave you was the best i' ve seen .
and i' ve been around too .
used to run a little liquor .
rode the scout car with a tommy gun in my lap .
tough racket .
terrible !
sit down .
you make me nervous .
maybe you don' t believe me .
what do you want ?
that' s better .
i' ve got something to sell , cheap .
for a couple of c' s .
don' t let me stop you .
don' t you want to even know who i am ?
i already know .
you' re not a cop .
you don' t belong to eddie mars , because i asked him .
so you must be one of brody' s friends .
so agnes is loose again , huh ?
how' d you know that ?
she' s a nice girl .
we' re talking about getting married .
she' s too big for you .
that' s a dirty crack , brother .
i suppose you' re right .
maybe i' ve been running around with the wrong people .
cut the babble .
what do you want ?
if you' re looking for something , will you pay for it ?
if it does what ?
helps you find regan .
this is getting funny .
i' m supposed to pay you two c' s for telling me i' m looking for regan .
people have been telling me that for days .
i don' t even pass out cigars anymore .
do you want to know what i' ve got , or don' t you ?
i don' t know .
200 buys a lot of information in my circle .
would you pay it to know where eddie mars ' wife is ?
would you pay $ 200 for that , shamus ?
i think i might .
where ?
agnes found her .
she' il tell you , when she has the dough in her hand .
you might tell the cops for nothing .
i ain' t so brittle .
agnes must have something i didn' t notice .
i ain' t tried to pull anything .
i came here with a straight proposition .
take it or leave it .
one right guy to another .
you start waving cops at me .
you ought to be ashamed of yourself .
i am .
200 it is .
have you got the money ?
where' s agnes ?
you know puss walgreen' s office ?
fulwider building ?
428 in the back ?
no , but i can find it .
will you be in shape to meet me there in an hour ?
i guess so .
you bring the dough .
i' il take you to agnes .
who are you ?
what do you want ?
i wanted to see you .
who are you ?
i work for eddie mars .
my name is canino .
canino ?
sure !
i thought you would remember .
what do you want ?
why have you been following that detective , marlowe ?
who says i' ve been ?
i do !
that was a mistake , your mistake .
eddie mars don' t like it .
sit down and quit stalling !
why are you tailing marlowe ?
all right , there' s no harm telling .
it was for joe brody' s girl .
she' s got to get out of town , that takes dough .
she figured she could get it through marlowe .
why would he pay ?
you know about the night the kid bumped brody ?
the young sternwood girl was there .
only marlowe didn' t tell the cops that .
agnes figured it was railroad fare as soon as she could get hold of him .
you get it ?
sure i get it .
where' s this agnes ?
what do you care ?
what do you want with her ?
what' s she got ...
what' s the matter , jones ?
ain' t you ever seen a gun before ?
where' s the girl ?
you want me to count to three , like a movie ?
where' s agnes ?
you win .
she' s in an apartment ... ... at 28 court street .
apartment 301 .
i guess i' m yellow , all right .
you just got good sense .
i ain' t going to hurt her .
not if everything' s like you say .
you' re nervous , ain' t you ?
i think maybe you need a drink .
i don' t think so ...
you got a glass ?
at the water cooler .
there you are , pal .
drink her down .
well , drink it !
what do you think it is , poison ?
i bet that agnes of yours wouldn' t turn it down .
no , i' il bet she wouldn' t .
what' s funny ?
nothing' s funny .
so long , jonesy .
information , give me the phone number of apartment 301 , 28 court street .
thank you .
one moment , please .
courtview apartments .
office , this is police identification bureau , wallace speaking .
you got a girl living there named agnes lowzier ?
nobody by that name here .
have you got a brunette with green eyes , kind of slanted ... ... either alone or with a little guy , weighs about 115 pounds ... ... wears a gray hat and gray suit ?
sorry .
nothing like that .
somebody just gave out the wrong address .
thanks .
you did all right , jonesy .
but you left me high and dry .
who is this ?
what did you say ?
i said , " who is this ?
hello , agnes .
this is marlowe .
marlowe , the man you want to see .
is harry there ?
yeah , he' s here .
put him on , will you ?
he can' t talk to you .
why ?
because he' s dead .
your little man died to keep you out of trouble .
i got your money for you .
do you want it ?
yeah , i want it .
have you got a car ?
where can i meet you ?
rampart and oakwood .
i' il be there in half an hour .
what happened to harry ?
there' s no use going into that .
you don' t really care anyway .
just put it down your little man deserved something better .
here you are .
here' s your 200 .
joe and i were riding on foothill boulevard a couple of weeks ago .
we passed a brown coupe and i saw the girl who was driving .
she was eddie mars ' wife .
there was a fellow with her .
canino .
i know him .
some people you don' t forget , even if you' ve only seen them once .
we got curious and joe tailed them .
do you know where realito is ?
about 10 miles east , there' s a side road .
off the highway , there' s a garage and paint shop ... ... run by a guy named art huck .
hot car drop , likely .
and a frame house right behind it .
that' s where eddie mars ' wife is holed up .
you sure of that ?
why should i lie ?
art huck' s , 10 miles east of realito .
is that right ?
so long , copper .
wish me luck .
i got a raw deal .
hey , your kind always does .
what do you want ?
open up .
i got a flat back here on the highway .
sorry , mister .
we' re closed for the night .
better try realito .
all right .
come on in .
you' d scare off a lot of trade with that .
you can get yourself hurt , kicking on doors .
cut it out , art .
the guy' s right .
you run a garage , don' t you ?
go ahead .
give him a hand .
thanks , mister .
i suppose you can fix flats ?
good as you can make them , but i' m busy working on a spray job .
it' s too damp for a good spray job , art .
you got time to fix his tires .
but i don' t ...
get moving !
sure .
here' s the key to the back .
put the spare on .
that' il make it easier .
yeah , i took a skid up at the corner .
a front tire went .
lucky to find some help .
you live around here ?
just drove in from reno and carson city .
came the long way around , huh ?
business trip ?
partly .
having your car painted ?
just a spray job .
art' s pretty slow .
he should' ve been finished by now .
all right , art .
take him in the house .
you' d be mrs. eddie mars ... ... the blonde regan was supposed to have run off with .
that' s right .
where is shawn regan ?
i' d like to know that myself .
hello , angel !
i thought i' d find you here .
but you don' t seem to be running in front today .
remove that light , will you , or move me ?
i suppose we' re in the house , in back of the garage .
that' s right .
the boys don' t take any chances , do they ?
where are they , out digging a grave ?
you had to go on with this , didn' t you ?
where are they ?
they' ve gone to telephone .
to call up eddie mars , huh ?
to find out what to do with me .
i could' ve told them that .
why did you have to go on ?
too many people told me to stop .
light me a cigarette , will you , angel ?
why did you have to make trouble ?
eddie never did you any harm .
besides , i was never in love with shawn .
we were just good friends .
if i hadn' t hidden here when shawn disappeared ... ... the police would' ve been certain he killed him .
maybe he did kill him .
eddie' s not that kind .
you mean , eddie mars never kills anybody ?
you really believe that , don' t you ?
yes , i do !
how do you suppose i found out you were here ?
how did you ?
a little man named harry jones told me .
a funny little guy , harmless .
i liked him .
he sold me the information because he found out ... ... i was working for general sternwood .
how he found out' s a long story .
anyway , canino , your husband' s hired man , got to him first ... ... while i stood around like a sap .
i was in the next room .
now that little man is dead .
but eddie mars didn' t do that .
you' re lying .
eddie mars never kills anybody .
he just hires it done .
you think he' s just a gambler , don' t you ?
i think he' s a blackmailer , a hot car broker .
stop talking !
a killer by remote control .
anything with money pinned to it !
anything rotten !
ask him when you see him .
well , that got rid of her .
she' s okay .
i like her .
you like too many people .
never mind , angel .
the water feels good .
i wonder if you' d do what she did for a man .
i was wondering that myself .
there' s nothing to do but wait for canino to come back .
he doesn' t know i was in the other room .
you know what he' il do when he finds out ?
he' il beat my teeth out and then kick me in the stomach for mumbling .
that' s just a start .
it won' t be pretty .
please don' t talk like that !
you should have gone to mexico ...
stop !
please !
then , you couldn' t have gone , could you ?
the border patrol would' ve checked you through alone .
too many people would' ve seen you without regan .
it was much safer to come here with her , especially for eddie mars .
will you get out of this and stay out if i let you go ?
take this thing out of my mouth , will you ?
that' s better .
get a knife and cut these ropes .
watch your fingers .
don' t cut toward your hand .
who' s got a key to these handcuffs ?
canino .
i don' t suppose there' s a gun around here ?
none that i know of .
the boys made a fast trip .
what can you do ?
look , angel .
i' m going to leave you in a tough spot .
that' s all right with me .
how do i get out of here ?
that door leads onto a side porch .
all right , as soon as i' ve gone , you count to 20 slowly ... ... and then scream your head off .
i will !
all right .
start counting .
get going , art .
you heard what i said !
there !
behind the wheel !
over here , canino !
that looks like the key .
we' il have to take his car .
how far is it from back there to the nearest telephone ?
about eight or 10 miles to realito .
why ?
when mars ' wife gets my car fixed , and he finds out what happened ... ... there' il be plenty of trouble .
you' il be in it just as much as i will .
i don' t mind , as long as you' re around .
i didn' t have a chance to thank you for what you did back there .
you looked good , awful good !
i didn' t know they made them like that anymore .
i guess i' m in love with you .
will you go to the police with me ?
i can' t .
why not ?
what if i told you i killed shawn regan ?
would you tell the police that ?
i will if you take me there .
i' m not going to .
look , angel , i' m tired .
my jaw hurts , my ribs ache , i killed a man back there ... ... and stood by while a harmless guy was killed .
i can' t say all that happened ... ... because geiger tried to throw a loop over carmen .
they' il swarm over your house ... ... so fast that every closet your family' s been in ... ... for the last six years will look like a police convention .
where' s shawn regan ?
why did mars hide his wife out to make it look like she ran off with regan ?
why did you hide out there ?
you' re playing with dynamite .
don' t ask any more questions .
i won' t even ask you how you got into this mess .
i' il ask eddie mars if i can get there quick enough .
why are you doing that ?
i guess i' m in love with you .
hello .
let me talk to mr. mars .
hello , eddie .
this is marlowe .
yeah , marlowe , or what' s left of him .
that canino' s a pretty good boy .
you' il have trouble getting another as good .
what' s the matter , eddie ?
can' t you talk ?
i' m in realito , the same place canino called from .
only now , it' s me that' s calling .
i want to see you .
why don' t you go to the police ?
i just killed your best boy .
do you want to see me or don' t you ?
all right .
where ?
las olindas is too far .
not your apartment either .
your house ?
you mean the one that geiger lived in ?
all right .
when ?
how long will it take me to get there ?
i' il be there just as quick as i can .
that worked .
you' re taking an awful chance .
he' il be here in 10 minutes .
go through there , and make sure that back door is locked ... ... and then close all these curtains .
i' il get rid of the car .
you' re the one who' s shaking now .
i' m scared , angel .
i' m sore too .
mars has been ahead of me all the way .
way ahead !
if i don' t get the jump on him this time , we' re cooked .
there they are .
watch the back .
if you see anybody coming , yell like you did before .
what is it ?
the curtain !
stop it swinging .
i got here first , eddie .
put those scissors down .
put them down !
turn around .
over there .
sit down .
there' s two men out in back , behind some trees .
watch them .
hello , mr. mars .
you double crossing ...
i told you to sit down .
and leave her out of it .
she' s all right , eddie .
she kept her deal with you .
she didn' t tell me a thing ... ... except that she killed regan .
but i didn' t believe that .
regan' s dead , all right , but she didn' t do it .
it was carmen , wasn' t it ?
how' d it happen ?
she didn' t tell .. ?
i asked you how it happened .
carmen liked regan .
but he liked your wife .
and he said no to carmen .
she gets mad when anybody says that .
i' ve seen her that way .
go on .
she was high .
by the time it was over , she couldn' t remember much about it .
i' ve seen her that way too .
then you hid the body .
you can' t prove that .
it' il be just as bad for you if i prove it to myself .
then you started to blackmail mrs. rutledge ... ... by telling her what carmen had done .
how did you prove to her that carmen had done it ?
prove it to me .
you' ve seen carmen when she' s that way .
sure i have .
have you ?
why didn' t you know her when you walked in that day ?
you' re pretty smart , but i' ve been waiting for this one .
what are you going to do ?
i said you were smart .
you walked in without a gun .
you were going to agree to everything , just like you' re doing now .
when i went out , things would be different .
that' s what those boys are doing out there .
but everything' s changed now , because i got here first .
angel , get on the floor !
don' t get excited , marlowe .
if anything happens , if there' s any shooting , you' il just ...
what do you think will happen now ?
what will your boys think ?
what will they do to the first one out that door ?
who' s it going to be , you or me ?
look , marlowe ...
you look at this !
haven' t you ever seen a gun before ?
you want me to count to three , like they do in the movies ?
that' s what canino said to little jonesy .
don' t go crazy !
jonesy took it better than you .
that' s one , eddie !
don' t , marlowe !
that' s two , eddie !
don' t shoot , it' s me !
mars !
bernie ?
this is marlowe .
i' ve got some more red points for you .
who is it this time ?
eddie mars .
his boys got him .
there' s more to it than that .
he killed regan .
i' il tell you about it when i see you .
where are you ?
the same place , laverne terrace .
come up and get me out of here .
and watch yourself .
they may still be outside .
right away .
it won' t take him long .
wait , let me do the talking .
i don' t know what i' il tell him , but it' il be pretty close to the truth .
you' il have to send carmen away ... ... from a lot of things .
they have places for that .
maybe they can cure her .
it' s been done before .
we' il have to tell your father about regan .
i think he can take it .
you' ve forgotten one thing .
me .
what' s wrong with you ?
nothing you can' t fix .
