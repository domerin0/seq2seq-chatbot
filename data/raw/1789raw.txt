a film by kay pollak
as it is in heaven .
my dear , sweet , daniel . . .
you never have to be afraid of those boys , ever again .
we won' t go on living here .
i' il find you another school .
pappa would have supported me in this , if he had been alive .
everything is for the best . just believe that , and all will be fine .
when i grow up i' m going to marry you , mommy .
ever since i was a little boy i had a dream to create music
that would open people' s hearts .
that was my dream .
at 1 4 , i was to compete at the junior soloist world championships .
a day i will always remember .
please !
make way , please !
one thing was new . . .
for the first time in my life my calendar was completely empty .
the doctor said it was a heart attack .
it wasn' t fatal , but he didn' t give me much hope .
your heart' s completely worn out .
jump , daniel . !
jump . !
i don' t know why i returned to the village of my childhood .
sometimes you do things without knowing why .
i reckoned that no one in the village would know that i' d once lived here .
my agent had given me a new name when i was 1 5 .
elementary school
remember to let the tap run before drinking .
the water comes from our own well .
i heard . . . you' d bought the old school here .
i thought i' d drop by .
i' m stig berggren , the village pastor .
i wanted to be the first to welcome you .
it' s my little custom to give each newcomer a bible .
in the name of jesus christ .
thank you .
i arrived 2 5 years ago and we ended up staying , my wife and i.
just think , daniel darus here in our old school .
but one can only wonder , what will you do here ?
i shall listen .
i see . . .
my wife inger and i wonder if you' d care to come to our home for dinner .
thank you , but i prefer to be alone .
perhaps he could hold a concert here in the village .
i' ve stopped performing !
though the church is really very beautiful .
there' s conny from the garage with my gun .
i saw your car , and thought . . .
here' s your gun .
i' ve checked it out , it works fine now .
i welded the barrel .
thank you so much .
was that you in the taxi ?
that was me who skidded past in the truck .
it' s a she . . .
bulls eye , right up her ass .
my christmas hare for the church .
thank you !
he' s a conductor .
world famous .
daniel darus .
one of those artist types , huh ?
has olga laughed today ?
what ?
isn' t your hearing aid on ?
has olga laughed today ?
what have you got today , lena ?
this norwegian and a swede are watching a funeral procession .
who' s the dead one ?
don' t know " , says the norwegian , " but i think that' s him in the coffin .
i' il put down the 65 crowns .
fine .
bye .
are you the one who bought the old school ?
yes .
i knew you' d come in here .
everyone has to eat .
would you listen to this ?
see if it' s good enough .
want a bingo lottery ticket ?
everyone plays " bingolotto " around here .
we had a winner once .
this is for you .
sure , we can handle just about anything .
see ya !
he wanted a bottle of jamaican , only thing that turns his girl on .
check it out .
24 speeds .
only 5, 800 crowns .
a lot of bike for your buck .
nothing wrong with buying a bike in the winter .
don' t let that . . .
eeh . . . nothing with fewer gears ?
c' mon , don' t be cheap with yourself .
people around here can be a bit narrow minded .
i' ve always driven yank cars .
i love the purr of an old v8 , the smooth ride .
folks get pretty bent out of shape over those wheels .
but you can' t let it get to you .
come spring thaw , out for a drive !
5, 200 , huh ?
well ?
listen , i' d like to show you something you could really help me out with .
now this is very dear to me .
we' ve got a choir in the village
that meets every thursday in the congregation hall .
we do a spring concert and you' re just the man to come and . . .
no , no , i' m too impatient . just to brush us up a little .
offer some good advice .
you aren' t cheap in that way ?
4, 600 .
i just came here to listen . . .
great !
come on thursday , to listen .
just to listen .
4, 200 and a sweatsuit thrown in .
see you on thursday .
prepare !
the lord is coming hills , sink !
and valleys , rise !
but i' m the one who runs this choir !
siv , he' s only coming to listen .
what' s his name ?
daniel darus .
typical arne , giving out orders .
i' m in charge of the choir .
he' s only going to listen .
we' re rehearsing any way .
you' re only in charge , siv because we don' t have a cantor .
does stig know about this ?
the pastor has nothing to do with it !
it' s all arne' s delusions of grandeur !
what' s the problem ?
he' s just going to listen and give a little advice .
musicians aren' t cheap in that way . . .
arne , simmer down .
well , if he' s coming , of course we should sing !
i' m not going to sing , neither is olga .
olga' s old enough to make her own decisions .
siv , come on .
you need a fella .
maybe he' s something for you .
as far as i know , he' s single .
oh , stop it !
no , don' t worry .
i' il be there when you get home .
yes , dinner' s ready .
but you said i could go .
i' il be home when you get there .
welcome .
i' m gabriella .
come on in .
glories stream from heaven afar
heavenly host sing alleluia
christ the savior is born
i was passing by and heard singing .
much of it is very nice .
we are not pros .
but we could be much better .
well , within our limitations .
i dreamt he would come .
i just wanted . . .
i was passing by and . . .
thank you so much .
he said " much of it is very nice " .
did he say " much of it " ?
those very words ?
yes !
much of it is very nice .
did you hear that , olga ?
much of it is very nice " , he said .
hello !
have you listened to the cassette ?
it' s me , lena . . .
the bingo lottery ticket .
carry on .
i' il be right there .
over there .
but your ticket didn' t win .
i' ve checked .
this is my boyfriend .
hi .
hello .
you' ve got to listen to it .
bye .
see you .
you need warmer clothes , daniel .
no you fucking don' t .
i told you !
you' re not going anywhere !
fucking slut !
stop it , stop it !
for god' s sake , stop it !
well , if it isn' t the little artist .
get your hands off her !
your kind don' t belong here !
i' m warning you !
no , conny !
let go !
mind your own business !
conny .
it' s him .
i confess , oh righteous god
that i have sinned in thought , word and deed .
i have not loved thee above all else nor my neighbour as myself .
through my sins i am guilty of more than i understand
and contribute to the world' s negligence of thee .
i beseech thee , help me cease my sins .
forgive me , in the name of jesus christ .
amen .
this is a surprise .
a simple position as cantor .
mass , weddings , christenings , funerals .
is it worth it ?
music is all i know .
but the church is cold and the salary meagre .
the pay is dreadful .
take my advice , don' t do it .
my mind' s made up .
a new cantor .
how nice .
welcome !
this is my wife , inger .
it' s up to the church council , so it' il take a while .
i' d like to begin immediately .
do you realize the job entails running the choir ?
but they can' t possibly meet your demands .
everything begins with listening .
when do you finish ?
i' il call you later .
imagine that all music already exists .
it' s up here , all around , vibrating , ready to be taken down .
it' s all a matter of listening , of being ready to take it down .
you understand ?
get it , fatso ?
yes .
each person has their own unique tone , their own individual tone .
and we' re going to find it .
arne here .
yes .
yes . . . yes .
don' t you want that with a built in dvd , yeah . . .
it' s got pal , ntsc and . . .
no , no ! just human voices .
yes .
some advice , please , on what to do .
how should i begin ?
right . . .
balance .
yes .
balance . . .
yes , exactly .
the torso .
and the stomach .
right .
we know where our stomachs are .
let' s massage them to wake them up .
and pat them . . .
. . . and massage them .
good !
put your hands here . . .
and twist , backwards , then forwards .
push away . . . . . . making a large circle .
good .
your fingers . . .
then shake them out .
excellent !
listen , and give it back .
let' s hope no one walks in on us .
is the door locked ?
each person has his own individual tone .
try and find yours .
begin , slowly . . . to sound . . .
find the harmony .
i started to think of the pastor .
music is about listening .
you' re so eager , arne !
the singing will come , later .
he' s worked with the great vocalists .
and we have fun , too .
i haven' t felt so happy in a very long time !
of course you must come , you must .
see you on thursday as usual .
bye .
don' t you sing ?
no , not yet .
later , says daniel .
why must you defend him ?
i' m not defending him .
i enjoy doing something new .
it' s good he takes things gently .
don' t deny you were defending him .
he' s trying to get to know us .
all hold hands .
now we' il find the source .
the core .
let me be clear .
either you participate , or you leave , please .
i' m just here to listen .
if you sit here it affects me .
i' m doing something here that' s entirely new to me .
and what , may i ask , are you doing ?
new faces , new sounds . . .
okay , maestro .
there' s a great difference between people here and in the big wide world .
one must observe certain limits .
as cantor many eyes are upon you .
what a grump !
i' m glad it' s just us now .
where were we ?
arms out .
we are going to the source . . .
excuse me .
hello ?
yes .
hi there !
no , i don' t do renovations .
is it a cadillac ?
i know a guy .
he' s really good .
he sold one for 700, 000 to a norwegian last week .
i' il call you in an hour or so .
okay ?
bye .
yep . . . we were going to the source , right ?
coffee break .
come along .
coffee ?
now ?
haven' t you understood a single thing ?
this is about us !
about who we are !
about our lives !
all music comes from within !
concentration !
without concentration , nothing can emerge !
nothing !
here .
have some water .
daniel , you know . . . this is all so new to us .
we aren' t used to . . .
coffee' s important , too .
i knew it .
hell , i knew it .
here we go !
gabriella . . .
lena .
olga .
amanda .
arne .
in on one , see ?
now find your unique voice . . .
. . . vibrating inside you .
find your tone .
i' il take care of this .
tore . . .
hello , tore .
arne , take it easy .
it' s only tore .
give him a cookie .
tore , we' re not locking up yet .
sit over here , tore .
tore , here !
cookie ?
i wan . . . join in .
tore , be a good boy now .
here' s a bun , with sugar on top .
he says he wants to join .
well , you see , he can' t read or write .
he' s cuckoo .
i want to join !
it' il just cause problems .
i know .
we must have some criterion .
i think tore should join us .
isn' t he your cousin , arne ?
for christ' s sake !
i' ve got plans for this choir !
don' t you see ?
i' m working very hard for us !
at the spring concert , is tore to be up there
next to fatso holmfrid ?
smoking outside , arne .
oh for god' s sake !
we can' t just let everything slide !
all this newfangled . . .
arne , wait !
arne is so dedicated .
great !
an a. erik .
gabriella .
now we' ve got two basses !
it pisses me off !
isn' t he your cousin " and " smoking outside " .
calm down arne .
are we running some kind of kindergarten ?
hiya .
hang on !
could i come an hour earlier next time ?
i' d like you to help me .
so i can find my tone .
just you and i ?
yes .
i' ve got to run .
it' s my new boyfriend .
see you !
an hour earlier .
bye bye !
stig , i' ve been wondering about your voice .
why do you sound so ceremonious doing weddings ?
' will you take this . . . ? '
marriage involves a major decision .
but it can make people nervous .
will you take . . . " people might get second thoughts , stig .
you do use different voices in church .
at christenings it' s one voice .
at funerals , a different one .
' dust to dust ; ashes to ashes . '
are you making fun of me ?
stig , will you take this woman ?
that' il do now .
i' m being serious , stig .
will you take this woman ?
can i see your shoes ?
you' il have to change shoes , or get them reheeled , for the right balance .
straighten your back .
walk up and down a bit , and sing .
take off your sweater .
we' il find your balance .
i know it' s there .
it just needs to be set free .
open your throat , open your chest .
release your sound .
i want to . . .
is there something stopping you ?
it scares me .
it' s all so much , i' m not sure i dare .
i' d like to tell you about something .
once , during a concert there was a power failure .
everything went black .
but the musicians continued to play .
they couldn' t see their music , nor me .
i leave it all up to the orchestra .
they all listen to each other .
no one sees me .
that' s when i experienced it for the first time .
58 seconds .
all minds were joined .
58 seconds . . .
that' s a pretty long time .
prague ' 82 .
i was 1 9 .
so you mean that . . . ?
it' s all there .
this is the great secret .
when everyone knows that . . .
that' s when we can take down the music .
i ask myself , what is he after ?
something' s happening to people there .
we haven' t rehearsed anything , not once .
not even for the services ?
nothing at all .
he' s up to something .
i' m sure of it .
what do you mean , siv ?
it feels like he' s using us for his own purposes .
i' d like you to keep attending , please .
hurrah !
listen everybody , listen !
daniel has said yes !
he can judge if we' re ready .
' are we really going to charge ? ' someone asked .
of course we are !
the village hall costs , all venues cost .
so a concert should cost .
i thought : tickets , 100 crowns each .
it increases the product value .
six weeks to go , to the concert .
the only valid excuse for absence is your own funeral .
great , arne !
i' m finished .
now let' s rehearse .
' glorious is all on earth . '
harmony .
glorious is all on earth
there you are !
you came here even though . . .
i told you to stay at home !
don' t think i don' t know !
wait , wait . . .
careful now , for christ' s sake !
he' s drunk .
that' s why he comes .
he' s dragged her away a few times .
but he beats her !
and everyone knows it .
i' ve tried talking to her so many times .
it' s like talking to a wall .
why doesn' t she leave him ?
he could do anything to her .
she doesn' t dare , she' s terrified .
look at tore there .
now we' re in the shit .
god , it stinks !
what did i tell you !
shut up , arne .
arne does have a point , lena .
god damn it siv !
are you starting ? !
haven' t you ever shit your pants ?
i' m beginning to wonder !
come along , tore .
say my name , lena .
tore .
say the other thing , too .
what is it you want me to say ?
the three words .
the three words ?
yes , say the three words .
i love you , tore .
hello !
hello .
what are you doing ?
nothing special .
going for a bike ride ?
yup . . .
shall we ride together ?
lena , i don' t know how .
you can' t learn to ride a bike on your own .
someone' s got to hold on .
don' t pedal yet , i' il push .
just try and keep your balance .
this is interesting .
interesting ?
yes .
you' re the one always talking about balance .
right .
climb on .
now , hold on .
are you holding on ?
yes .
you' re holding on ?
you' ve got to .
yes !
i am holding on .
i am !
eyes ahead . . .
don' t look back !
you weren' t holding on !
you weren' t holding on .
six metres , daniel .
not bad for first time .
there' s no harmony .
sit down .
is there anyone here who needs to get something off their chest ?
i' ve something i' d like to bring up .
oh for god' s sake .
but we' re going to have a party .
go on , siv .
i' ve always thought that lena has a way , that' s not good for this choir .
and it concerns all of us .
lena ? !
" a way that' s not good for the choir ?
arne , daniel' s asked us to be open .
so i really want to be honest .
don' t we have a responsibility to each other here in the choir ?
lena and i sing the same part , and we' re to harmonize , aren' t we ?
are we to just stand by and ignore the kind of life she leads ?
why doesn' t anyone ever object ?
damn it !
pull yourself together , siv !
arne . . .
it' s not the christian faith to party on saturday night . . . . . . and then . . .
you know what i mean . . .
then to stand in church and sing on sunday morning .
inger , is this any type of example for the young girls in the congregation ?
seeing lena hop in and out of all these different cars .
in and out of different cars ?
it happens right in front of our eyes .
you know as well as i do .
the young girls might think it has something to do with love .
that that' s the way for a woman to behave .
there , i' ve said what i have to say .
right .
admit it , siv you' re just jealous of lena .
you ought to be ashamed , laughing at someone who dares be honest !
try being honest yourself !
tore' s pacing .
where' s the corkscrew ?
i' il go out and get siv .
party time !
florence , florence , florence !
lips are silent
eyes are speaking
love me , do
violins and bows play waltzes
love me , do
this one' s for you , arne !
sin in the congregation hall , stig .
go go girls like sodom and gomorrah .
i know it all !
you know it all ?
yes !
nothing' s happened .
you expose your breasts in the congregation hall and this is nothing ?
i was a bit tipsy , dancing . . .
sin has descended . . .
stop it !
inger , you have sinned !
on church premises !
now i' m going to say something i' ve wanted to say for a long time .
something that' s plagued me for 20 years .
there is no sin .
all this damn talk about sin !
it only exists in your head .
what !
there is no sin .
there is no sin ?
think of what you' re saying !
i have thought .
the church invented sin .
handing out guilt with one hand then offering redemption with the other .
it' s all a lie , hot air , to suppress people , to gain power .
silence !
ask for god' s forgiveness !
god doesn' t forgive , don' t you get that !
because he' s never condemned .
silence !
try to be humble , stig .
i am humble !
you think i didn' t know about it ?
for years i' ve known you' ve had your pictures here .
you' ve come out here before we' ve made love . . .
to have a look . . .
black stockings , high boots , bottoms . . .
to get stimulated .
it' s all right , stig .
but don' t condemn others .
inger , god hears you .
he hears and he smiles , you can bet on it .
the church has made a sin of sexuality .
god hasn' t .
you' ve had a need , you haven' t hurt anyone by it .
there have been a few times in bed we' ve enjoyed . . .
even if we' ve never reached heaven together , not yet .
stop it . . .
stig .
i love you .
i always have .
i' ve kept everything inside .
but not any more .
i' ve kept my mouth shut , repressed everything i' ve felt . . . . . . and seen , and heard and thought .
come . . .
come , stig . . .
jesus christ , forgive me my sins . . .
inger , what happened last night between us . . .
i' ve longed for , for so long .
inger . . .
it never happened .
what ?
it never happened . . .
i repeat : what happened between us last night never happened .
the kindly green leaves of spring have adorned the meadows and valleys
we' ve got three new members in the choir today , young people .
how nice .
the sunlight and whispering leaves
proclaim the arrival of summer
good !
very good !
that' s how it should sound !
right ?
yes !
one more thing , some good news : ticket sales are going well .
we' re getting a bit famous , see ?
we should be sold out . !
hurrah !
