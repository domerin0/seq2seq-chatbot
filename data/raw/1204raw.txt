fuller , we get two seconds to make ...
capt. fuller !
capt. fuller , we get two seconds to make a decision .
you get two months to sit there and tear it apart .
swat means " special weapons and tactics .
where were your tactics out there ?
saving a woman from getting shot .
that' s where they were .
every cop knows we did the right thing .
sometimes doing the right thing isn' t doing the right thing .
what the hell does that mean ?
sergeant .
you disobeyed a direct order .
end of story .
you' re both off swat .
they' re two of our best officers .
i' m not sticking them in the field after a stunt like that .
sorry , i didn' t know that saving lives was a stunt .
you got a big mouth , and you' re quick on the trigger ... ... and that is why your ass is in a sling .
if you' re gonna put them off swat , at least keep them in the division .
give them a shot at getting back .
stick them in the gun cage .
get them out of my sight .
gun cage ?
this is total bullshit .
what ?
i said , this is bullshit .
really ?
yeah .
you should consider yourself lucky lt. velasquez is standing up for you .
i' m lucky i don' t work for an asshole like you .
that' s it !
you' re out of here , gamble !
you' re gone !
control yourself !
get out of here !
what the hell' s the matter with you ?
street !
you stay .
hey !
give us a minute .
please , sit down .
i' il stand .
look , jim ... ... we both know that gamble is a bad influence on the rest of the team .
gamble' s a good cop .
unlike him , you still have a chance at a future here .
you go on record that gamble acted recklessly ... ... and you had to follow your partner in after he disobeyed orders ... ... and i will make sure that you are back on swat tomorrow morning .
let' s get the hell out of here .
i need a cocktail .
i' m staying .
you' re what ?
what ... ?
after that ?
couple months ... ... fuller will find new asses to chew out .
we' il be back on the team .
fuller is the cockroach of this department , brother .
he' s not gonna give us a second chance .
what are you gonna do ?
piss away all the hard work you did to get here ?
piss what away , jimmy ?
the cage ?
come on , man .
we' re better than that , and you know it .
you gonna come with me ?
a real partner wouldn' t have to ask that , would he ?
a real partner would step up to what he did in the bank .
yeah .
i saved the hostage .
you disobeyed the hold .
no , i saved that hostage !
you disobeyed the hold !
you made the decision yourself .
and you shot a hostage .
jesus , brian !
you sound a lot like fuller .
is that what you two were talking about in there ?
did you rat me out ?
you cut a deal to get back on the team , jimmy ?
did i cut a deal ?
yeah , did you ?
how many times have i covered up for one of your goddamn stunts ?
that' s what a partner' s supposed to do .
you just picked a paycheck over me , bro .
you just picked yourself over everything else .
you want to stay here and be fuller' s bitch ... ... you go right ahead .
i can' t do it .
i can' t do it .
damn it .
goddamn it .
goddamn it , jim !
partners for five years .
this is how you want to end it .
i didn' t end it .
you sold me out to the brass .
you know , i never realized till now how full of shit you are .
fuck you and swat .
you' re too attached to that soda , gus .
love that stuff .
the wife would have my behind if she busted me sucking that down .
why , is she a mr. pibb fan ?
you know the deal , jim .
when we got married , i converted to mormonism .
we can' t consume anything that alters our state of mind .
we treat our bodies with respect .
and i treat mine like an amusement park .
it' s the differences that make this country great .
need them cleaned by the morning , boys .
you were supposed to have it in a half hour ago .
what , your boy gonna report me to the captain ?
just for thinking you look good in that mustache .
your mom seems to like it , though .
so does your sister .
hey , sarge , welcome back .
look who' s back .
welcome back , sarge .
what' s up , hondo ?
hey , sarge .
howdy .
what do you need ?
sgt. hondo ?
you' re back .
you know what they say , gus .
you' re either swat or you' re not .
yes , sir .
what can i do for you ?
oh , just a tune up .

and i made some modifications ...
to the trigger too .
and you are ?
jim street .
street .
yeah , we' il leave them intact .
i need that back by tomorrow .

good to see you .
good seeing you .
gosh , gus , is that a woody ?
heck , yeah .
that' s hondo .
he' s old school swat .
the gold standard of ass kicking .
sorry , butt kicking .
i guess he' s back .
i guess he is .
a weeklong series , attacking us top to bottom .
and it' s all swat' s fault , right ?
no , the chief' s been pretty fair about blaming everyone .
he does want these bad headlines to end .
he wants the old warhorses to help restore the luster .
old ?
i know you ain' t talking about me .
you gotta shake off that three year rust from rampart .
i' m throwing you in right away .
sooner the better .
i want you to put together a young , kick ass element for me , dan .
you select them , you train them , you mold them .
i know you' re not talking about giving me five pups fresh out of the gate .
i didn' t come back to wipe noses .
hell , no .
now , you worked with t. j. and boxer at southwest .
you up for supervising them here ?
that' s a start .
now all you have to do is find three fresh ones .
only catch is , fuller has to approve the three .
what did capt. fuller say when he heard the chief was bringing me back ?
hasn' t stopped swearing since .
what' s your brother' s truck doing outside ?
we having a garage sale i don' t know about ?
you weren' t supposed to be home for an hour .
sorry to screw up your getaway .
look , let' s not make this a thing , okay ?
we both knew it was coming .
it' s not like we were in this to get married , right ?
and you' ve changed since ...
well , people change .
look , when it was good it was great , right ?
that means something .
yeah , thanks .
damn it !
hey !
hey !
i' m gonna throw this thing out .
do and you die .
every swat team in the world' s gonna have one someday .
it' s 50 pounds of scrap metal .
all right .
say you got some crazy suspect barricaded in a house .
all right .
just chain this to the back of a truck ... ... shove this end right through the wall ... ... these rods spring out like fishhooks .
your partner guns the truck , takes the whole wall with him .
and we waltz right in and surprise the bad guy , right ?
correct .
i call it " the key to the city .
patent pending .
is that right ?
right .
let me get your m 4 .
and ...
took the rattle out of the receiver .
yeah , new buffer , new gas rings .

there' s a few people that i would like to thank .
my fellow swat officers , all of you , thank you for believing in me ... ... when the bosses didn' t give me a chance .
that' s why you' re the marksman and i' m the guy who tells you who to shoot .

who you looking for ?
chris sanchez .
i' m chris sanchez .
you' re chris sanchez ?
look , if you' re internal affairs ... ... that guy had razorblades in his mouth .

i' m sick and tired of these bullshit complaints because some " vato ... " ... doesn' t like getting thrown to the pavement by a woman .
i look like iad to you ?
who are you ?
wait , now , that guy had about 100 pounds on you .
all brawn , no brains .
you didn' t answer my question .
so you still want to work swat ?

am i looking at another day of chauffeur duty ?
team' s almost filled .
not that it hasn' t been fun .
well , i do have one more spot .
can you think of anybody i might' ve overlooked ?
this a game or a test , sergeant ?
could be a bit of both .
yeah , i' m a little old for games .
all right .
so how' d you like to be back on swat ?
it' s not gonna happen .
so why you hanging around the cage then ?
it' s a job .
and swat' s a calling .
anybody around you for five minutes can tell you still got the bug .
all you gotta do is say yes .
it' s not up to me or you .
i got a history here .
yeah , let' s talk about that .
i heard some rumors about you and your old partner .
did you give him up in fuller' s office ?
because , you know , team members gotta trust each other .
i' m not on your team .
and no , i didn' t give him up .
you' ve been in that cage six months , shining boots and fixing weapons ... ... waiting for a second chance .
i got one , and i' m offering it to you .
fuller will never sign off on it .
you let me deal with that paper pushing punk .
i want you on my team .
let me tell you , it' s the sauce .
if you don' t have the right sauce , what do you got ?
you know ?
my mother , she used to make sauce .
now you go into the store , and you buy it in a jar or in a can ...
alex ?
alex !
nobody told me you were coming .
when did you get here ?
surprise .
happy birthday , uncle .
come on , sit down .
sit .
bring some champagne , huh ?
sit , eat .
the chief' s making me take you back .
he' s concerned about losing all his best officers .
he thinks i' m one of his best officers ?
but ... ... he' s given me complete oversight .
and trust me , you got no room for error .
so i will give you boxer , t. j. mccabe and this new guy ... ... deacon kaye .
i have to pass on the other two .
sanchez is a woman , and street ...
well , street' s on my shitlist .
hey , i' m on your shitlist too , and i' m the team leader .
you work for me now , and it' s my team to choose .
with all due respect , captain , other leaders get to pick their teams .
and you can too .
just pick two new people .
look ... ... just give me the team i ask for .
you can even call it your shitlist team .
that way , if anything goes wrong , you can put all the blame on me .
it' d be just like old times .
okay .
okay , you got your team .
but when you fail , and you probably will fail ... ... sanchez goes back to traffic , and you and street are plain gone .
no , not just off swat , off the force .
you feel me ?
oh , yeah .
i feel you .
okay , i' m leaving now .
no , don' t go .
i have wine and cognac from home .
come on .
i must go .
i have a flight to catch .
oh , catch another flight .
let me introduce you to monica .

it' s a beautiful knife , and she' s a beautiful woman .
now , why don' t you stay , have a good time and go back tomorrow .
listen , i' m running the business now .
i' m the new boss .
don' t joke with me , alex .
and don' t ever forget , your father' s running the business .
no , i retired him .
he never spoke of that to me .
that' s because he can' t speak anymore .
you put your hand in my father' s pocket .
not in mine .
if you take my money , i' il take your life .
understood ?
mail it to me .
yeah !
smile !
good evening .

all right , here' s the scenario .
there are six hijackers armed with handguns and knives ... ... in control of that plane .
they' ve killed one hostage and are threatening to kill the others ... ... unless they get a pilot and fuel within the hour .
there' il be swat officers disguised as hostages .
other swat officers will be playing the roles of terrorists .
and they will be trying to kill you .
staff sergeants will be grading us .
couldn' t give us the bus , huh , hondo ?
they always give us the bus .
fuller' s really got it in for us .
you think ?
another thing .
there are two dynamic entry points .
one here beneath the front landing gear ... ... one back here by the baggage compartment .
i' m sure fuller' s got surprises at both those entrances .
we get bogged down anywhere , we fail .
any ideas ?
there' s another way in , hondo .
there' s an elevator shaft where they bring in the service carts .
and there' s a mechanic' s access right here .
man , that' s gonna be tight as hell .
yeah .
