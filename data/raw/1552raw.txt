i' m a fucking people person .
um ...
why should you choose me ?
i' m a team player .
what do i think about the rules ?
nightly curfew ?
if it' s a house in the middle of nowhere , why the need to break the curfew ?
stay indoors when we' re sleeping and go out during the day .
it' s not hard .
well , er , usually i don' t like rules but , you know , these ones don' t bother me .
i think i could stick to the rules for a million dollars , yeah .
hey , check it out .
i think we' re being watched .

oh , grandpa !

i' m gonna take him on vacation when we get back .
and i' ve missed my friends .
although i' d like to think i' ve made some new ones .
ayy !
probably just a coyote .
yeah , it' s always a damn coyote .
i hate this house .
fucking creepy ass house .
what is it ?
you see anything ?
no .
nothing , as usual .
you do think he' s cute , right ?
he' s cute .
so ?
so ?
so i' d prefer my intimate moments to be intimate moments .
it' s not a porn site .
you could always do it under the covers or in the den .
the freezer !
i don' t know , there' s just ...
there' s something .
he' s just so intense all the time .
oh , yeah .
he' s a guy , and it' s been six months that he' s been here , he' s really fucking horny , he' d fuck a hole in the wall !
shh !
ok .
let' s take a look .
it' s definitely cold in the house .
nobody brought the flashlight , huh ?
what do i do with the clicker thingy ?
i' m fine .
you motherfuckers .
this is deliberate , they' re putting the squeeze on us .
look at this .
everything has to have an angle with you .
maybe it just broke down .
so what do we do ?
i don' t know .
start a fire .
yeah , there' s no dried firewood outside .
no , but there' s plenty of dry shit in the attic .
we can chop some of that up .
go to work , boys .
oh , god !
smells like piss in here .
looks like mommy and daddy liked to keep the kiddies in the cupboard .
what parent would do that ?
they must have been talking to my stepfather .
take cover !
i always wanted a talking one .
oh , emma .
yes , matt ?
oh , emma .
matt ?
emma .
matt .
emma .
emma !
emma !
oh , emma !
oh , matt !
oh , emma !
oh , matt !
matt , wait !
wait !
what ?
what ?
matt !
what ?
that' s my ass .
i know , emma .
i know .
grow up , rex .
don' t give me that nice guy bullshit .
you don' t wanna fuck ?
oh , matt ...
matt ... you don' t have a dick !
why don' t you ...
you don' t have a dick ?
you wanna talk small dicks ?
yeah .
charlie talked to emma .
take cover !
yeah .
what the fuck are you laughing at ?
today' s the first day of the rest of your life as a nonsmoker .
jesus , i have never heard so many fucking owls .
you think they have a tape out there ?
so , i' m thinking , when we get back , are we gonna get mobbed or what ?
have to go into hiding ?
have a stalker ?
hmm ?
ooh , yeah .
you knowthe number one cause of most stalkings ?
forgetfulness .
forgetfulness ?
people forgetting to close their curtains .
their curtains ?
i read about this one lady who used to walk around inside her house at night , buck naked , lights on , curtains wide open .
she was always forgetting to close them because her property overlooked woods .
no one out there , right ?
only there was .
this stalker guy .
just watching those bright , welcoming windows every night .
he started to think she didn' t shut them because she wanted him to see in , that she was inviting him into her life .
so he started this fantasy relationship with her , all built out of little things like , when she' d hang her laundry out that was like a love token , an offering .
so he' d steal her panties .
and getting more and more intimate , this love affair in his head .
finally , one night he breaks in .
only when he meets her , he meets a stranger .
an upset stranger freaking out , wanting him to get out .
he thinks she' s just playing hard to get so he asserts himself .
rapes her .
strangles her to keep her from screaming .
thanks , matt .
yeah , thanks .
now i suddenly feel all on display .
how can you suddenly feel all on display ?
it' s like hello ?
hello ?
hello ?
on the web is one thing , outside my window is another .
don' t worry .
statistically , strangers rarely kill strangers .
you' re much more likely to be killed by somebody you know .
a kid i was at school with killed his parents .
no shit !
what happened there ?
he used a hammer .
he beat them to death .
jesus .
that' s a little harsh .
who was he ?
did you know him ?
give it up , emma .
i can' t really remember , i moved away before it happened .
what was his name ?
fuck .
probably just the wind .
what is that ?
matt .
matt .
aah !
oh , jesus !
i' m sorry .
danny , there' s someone upstairs .
in the attic .
are you sure ?
yeah .
all right .
let' s go .
it' s coming from up there .
jesus !
it' s ok .
it' s just scared .
crows can scent death , it' s kind of a bad omen to have them flying around your house .
whoa .
oh .
i think it' s hurt .
hold that .
there we go , i got him .
i got him .
it' s got a broken wing .
oh !
it was the kindest thing to do .
i' il take it out at daybreak .
aaah !
oh , god , rex .
what the fuck are you guys doing up here ?
i' m going to bed .
we had a visitor .
what ?
yeah .
it must have thought it was trapped .
oh .
yeah , i can relate .
this fucking house .
' what would i do for a million bucks ?
' i guess i' d do as little as i had to . '
would you drive to school naked ?
' do i have to get out of the car ? '
hey , guys package .
a package !
nice find , danny .
i found it by the pool .
come on , food , food , food , food !
cigarettes , cigarettes .
yes , yes , yes , yes !
bricks ?
bricks ?
and a letter .
this isn' t funny .
we need supplies .
they' re tightening the screws .
it' s addressed to you .
i want a letter .
what is it , man ?
danny ?
hey .
so , the letter said that the funeral takes place in two days in florida .
florida ?
yeah .
so obviously he wouldn' t make it back for the curfew .
we can' t stop him if he wants to go .
no .
we just have to persuade him that it' s in his best interests to stay here .
his best interests ?
we don' t even know if this letter' s real .
only a twisted mind would think of that .
yes , and they are twisted .
what , bricks instead of food ?
you don' t think this could be part of their game ?
could you build a creepier house ?
what if they' re fucking with us ?
think about it no heat , no food , nowthis .
danny' s the weakest link , they wanna break us .
come on .
no , think about it .
really think about it .
we are this close to a million dollars , guys , we are this close .
they don' t want to pay us , they don' t want us to make it .
or maybe they' re spicing it up for the viewers .
or maybe his grandfather is dead !
if his grandfather' s dead , he' s dead .
i' m sorry .
his grandfather practically raised him .
do you have no feelings at all ?
cut the crap , i' m here for the money , ok ?
so are you .
dress it up however you want exposure , slumming it , finding yourself i don' t know .
the only person not here for the money is the one who needs it the most but , no , danny' s here to make friends .
fine , let' s be friends to the guy , let' s give him some long term , practical help .
well , we can' t hold a gun to his head .
no .
ok .
we' il tell him we' il have an alternative memorial service in the yard .
emma , tell him .
you tell him .
we all know he likes you best , just ask him nicely .
you would do it best .
maybe we should just let him go .
some things are more important than money .
yeah , what , like pussy ?
hey , man , fuck you .
doesn' t family mean anything to you ?
you don' t miss what you' ve never had , man .
take cover !
' let' s go . '
look !
what ?
what the hell ... ?
jesus .
it must have been one of the guys fucking around .
no .
charlie , i think it' s someone else .
who ?
i think we' re out of shot .
shoot .
you know i told you all about that kid at my school who killed his parents ?
his name was john riley .
well , he wasn' t just a kid at my school , he was a kid on my street .
we used to play together after school .
we had this one favourite game , scaredy cat , where we' d see who could spook each other the most .
and it started out , you know ,
like jumping out from behind trees shouting , " boo !
that kind of thing .
but then it got more serious .
john had a kitten , which he adored .
he' d sneak it into school in his knapsack .
one time ...
i swapped the kitten for a brick and i tossed the knapsack into the school pool .
he was so scared , he peed his pants .
right in front of everyone .
when i showed him the kitten was fine , he just gave me this look , this black look .
like , " never turn your back
because one day i' m going to get you back for this .
but he wouldn' t surrender the game .
he just kept screaming ,
you sick bitch .
first the bricks in the package , now someone writes this .
it feels so personal .
i mean , why am i being singled out ?
charlie ...
you don' t think that ...
emma , i ...
i just think that we' ve been in this house way too fucking long .
like rex says , it' s all a game .
i bet it' s the company ...
but how would they know all that ?
i don' t know .
research , i guess .
let' s just go back to bed , ok ?
come on , it' il be ok .
come and keep me warm .
guys , a package .
better be food this time .
oh .
sweet .
champagne .
they do still love us .
five .
you motherfuckers .
one for each , i guess .
i know what this ...
you cocksuckers , i know what this means .
fuck you .
do your fucking research , cos him doing that to himself was the best thing that ever fucking happened to me .
what ?
i say we put this out of harm' s way .
come on .
let' s go upstairs .
they think they can fuck with me now ?
his dad , right ?
you' re here to check up on me .
it' s not a front , matt , i just don' t care .
i wish i did but i don' t .
anyways , i brought my own coping mechanism .
sit down .
hand me that book .
you want to worry about somebody , worry about bundy .
i don' t know whether to feel sorry for him or be afraid of him .
why did they pick you , matt ?
what are the skeletons in your closet ?
like i' m gonna spill it now ?
give them some ammo to shoot me with ?
that' s good .
yeah , that' s good .
but if there are any , they got ' em already .
question is , do you have any ?
or are you just sliced white bread ?
is someone out there ?
emma ?
you ok ?
the security lights just popped and i would swear there' s someone on the edge of the forest .
look , you' re just freaked out .
charlie told us what happened last night .
emma , you can' t think this has anything to do with ...
to do with what ?
when you were a kid , you know ?
yeah .
i guess that would be ridiculous .
i know .
yeah .
aaah !
emma !
what ... ?
what' s wrong ?
what is that ?
oh , my god .
oh , shit .
is that some kind of joke ?
rex , did you put that in there ?
fuck off , charlie .
just don' t touch it !
put it down !
what the fuck ?
i didn' t put it there !
did you hear anybody ?
there' s people , like , walking round the house ?
calm the fuck down , please .
for two seconds .
emma , there' s nobody here .
guys , this is the company all over again .
they' ve raised the stakes but they' re playing the same fucked up game , so calm down .
they' re coming inside now ?
game over .
i can' t take this .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
i' m gonna radio them .
they can pick me up .
no , no , no , no .
i mean , no .
listen .
wait , stay .
emma ?
emma , emma .
look , it was me .
ok ?
it was me .
i' m sorry .
it was a stupid joke .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
wait .
what' s your problem ?
what' s your problem ?
you' re always picking on people .
stop it !
stop it !
come on .
danny !
it' s not worth it .
you ok ?
i' m here for the money .
what' s your excuse ?
what , you' ve got no life of your own ?
it' s not real enough for you ?
no family ?
what is it ?
i pity you .
you sad fuck .
rex .
i just wanted to say that , even for you , that was really fucked up .
why would you do that ?
i didn' t put it there , ok ?
i didn' t put it there , i just said i did so emma wouldn' t leave .
i need that fucking prize money and i wasn' t gonna let her leave .
oh , shit .
oh , god , don' t do that .
i still think it' s the company , all right ?
it' s the company .
but how would they get it in there ?
they control all this shit , right ?
it' s part of their game .
they wanted to spice things up so this is what they do .
plus , i think ...
you know , maybe they' re ... pissed off there hasn' t been any action or whatever .
well , not recently .
anyways ...
you think they' re punishing us ?
yeah .
i don' t know , maybe .
maybe we' ve been ... punishing ourselves , you know ?
god , i wish i had a smoke .
charlie , wait .
charlie , charlie , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
ok .
you want a cigarette ?
don' t say i never did nothing for you .
one pack of cigarettes .
for you .
oh , my god .

shut the fuck up .
oh , my god .
guys !
guys !
charlie , shut the fuck up .

why' d he take cigarettes ?
he doesn' t even smoke .
to fuck with me .
he' s a snake .
he' d sell his own grandmother .
he says my grandpa' s not dead .
that the letter' s fake and it' s all part of the game .
do you think it' s true ?
you got to give me some of that .
you are such a selfish bastard .
oh , fuck you .
fuck you , you are so fucking self righteous .
you' re so fucking self important .
all this john riley bullshit , do you really think he gives a fuck about you now ?
jesus , emma , you must really fucking rate yourself .
knock it off , rex .
go fuck yourself , matt , cos she' s not going to .
you know , if i was a psycho killer ,
i wouldn' t be hanging out there .
i' d have my sights set right on this house .
that' s enough , rex .
don' t kid yourself , she' s not into you either .
asshole .

what' s the site ?
we weren' t told .
you weren' t ...
you weren' t told ?
the company that set this up didn' t start advertising till we got here .
well , they didn' t do such a hot job because i never heard of you .
and i live online .
maybe you live in the wrong area .
well , it' s the internet .

he' s not .
if he was , where' s the body ?
they want us to call for help , guys .
that' s what they want .
if we do , you think some cop is gonna care about our curfew when he sees my rap sheet ?
all you can think about is the curfew .
if we call the cops , we lose .
that' s what they want .
that' s what they want !
oh , christ !

especially at you .

that' s why he picked the easy target .
you noticed he wasn' t too afraid of the cameras , right ?
travis , travis , travis .

it' s not ok !
it' s so not ok .
what are we gonna do ?
we wait for the helicopter .
game' s over , right ?
can' t go on now .
what about ... ?
it' s not our responsibility .
it' s their fucking game .
we' ve played everything fair up till here , guys .
this is not our fault .
we' ve done nothing wrong here .
we can' t .
we can' t leave him there .
you' re not supposed to move him .
i saw it on tv .
we can' t move him .
we should cover him .
we should cover him .
or we could take him outside .
outside ?
yeah , well , you want ...
where else ?
ok .
you guys take him outside , and we' re gonna try the radio .
please .
that' s good .
hello , can anybody hear me ?
please , somebody' s dead .
please help .
please , we need help .
nobody' s there .
i just fucking can' t believe that he ...
this isn' t what we signed up for .
no , it' s not .
what kind of a sick fuck would subscribe to this ?
hold on a minute .
hold on a fucking minute .
ok .
sorry the way things have turned out for us .
it' s ok .
come here .
emma , i ...
guys !
guys !
you' ve got to fucking see this .
where' s charlie ?
charlie !
ever wonder howthe company plans on paying us ?
or howthey pay for the house , the food and the helicopter ?
advertising .
subscriptions .
you don' t get one without the other .
if nobody subscribes , the revenues dry up .
and i' ve been thinking , this guy travis , he was a fucking programmer , a web head .
he should spend his entire life on the internet , so how had he never seen a single ad ?
there' s tons of shit on the internet .
right .
that' s why i went on the internet .
how ?
the satellite uplink still works .
where did you learn that ?
computer club .
i' ve been looking for our site .
i have put our names through every single fucking search engine i can think of and i have got nothing , guys .
and i mean nothing at all .
not even an advertisement .
nothing , not a single fucking ad .
it' s a big place .
yeah .
but why are they making it so difficult to find the site ?
if they want people to go to it , why are they making it so tough ?
well , i did find it .
it was hard as hell , but i found it .
but it' s fucked .
it doesn' t have a name , it' s a beta site .
i tripped over it , i was tipped off on a hacker newsgroup .
what' s a beta site ?
a beta site is a ...
like a password name , like a mess of letters and numbers instead of a real name .
it' s fucked .
take a look .
this is our site ?
i don' t know .
i' m trying to subscribe , i' ve been using travis' s credit card .
this has a limit of $50, 000 .
how do you know ?
you learn a lot at computer club .
you can buy a house with that .
but it doesn' t get you to the keyhole on this .
i don' t get it .
i don' t get it either .
i don' t get it either !
this place doesn' t fucking advertise .
it doesn' t even have a real address , so all i can come up with is that it doesn' t want to attract attention .
but why ?
and the security ... the security is fucking insane .
i threw every hacker file i have at this , we' re talking serious back door fuckers , and i still can' t bypass the encryption .
so what' s your point ?
my point , guys ... simply put , is why the fuck would people pay so much money to watch us ?
i wanna know , is this thing legit ?
is it fucking legit ?
is it legal ?
like a porn site ?
yeah , but except for her escapades it' s hardly porn .
so , what is it then ?
what ?
am i the only person thinking this here ?
is it only clear to me ?
nobody' s ever heard of a snuff movie before ?
