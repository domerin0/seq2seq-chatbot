tom , where are the magazines ?
they got held up at the printers .
i saw you selling them .
oh , that' s right .
they didn' t review me , did they ?
no , they ... reviewed you all right .
it' s poetry , page 1 1 .
essentially commercial .
bourgeois poetic .
nakedly ambitious .
it' s not very flattering .
who the hell do they think they are ?
well , you can ask them yourself if you want .
there' s a launch party at the women' s union tonight .
8 : 00 .
where is he ?

the one who wrote it .

no .
the one who wrote " fallgrief s girlfriend .
this edward hughes .
ted .
he' s over there .
i read your poems .
what ?
as soon as i saw them , i knew they were the real thing .
great , big , crashing poems .
not blubbering baby stuff like the others .
they' re colossal .
magnificent .
great blowing winds on steel girders .

i like .
oh , most dear , unscratchable diamond .

sylvia plath .
sylvia plath .

black marauder .

it' s a bit morbid , isn' t it ?
he' s my black marauder .
well , don' t get your hopes up .
why ?
what have you heard ?
him and his crowd , all they care about is poetry .
anything else is a distraction .
including steady girlfriends .
even pretty american ones ... with fulbright scholarships and red bicycles .

ted hughes called for her .
you' re late .
he was here .
who ?
your black marauder .
him and his little playmate , legless , chucking clods at my window .
thought it was yours apparently .
what did he say ?
nothing comprehensible .
sylvia , he left an address .
the chief defect of henry king was chewing little bits of string .
at last he swallowed some which tied itself in ugly knots inside .
physicians of the utmost fame were called at once " [ ted ]
no , no , no .
it' s it' s magic .
it' s not about magic .
it' s not like magic .
it is magic .
" when henry with his latest breath , cried , ' oh , my friends " '
it' s real magic .
it' s not conjuring tricks ...
or pulling rabbits out ofbloody hats .
bugger !
incantations , spells , ceremonies , rituals wh what are they ?
they' re poems .
but if it comes to slaughter
so what' s a poet ?
he' s a shaman , that' s what he is .
or she .
" now in injia' s sunny clime , where i used to spend my time " a fucking good poem is a weapon .
it' s and not like a a popgun or something .
" it was ' din !
din !
din ! " ' it' s a bomb .
it' s like a bloody big bomb .
that' s why they make children learn them in school .
hitherao !
water , get it . !
panee lao !
they don' t want them messing about with them on their own .
i mean, just imagine if a sonnet went off accidentally .
boom .
drink . !
drink . !
bollocks .
sylvia .
come on , sylvia .
go on . just get up .
give us some of your american poetry .
go on .
if it be you that stir these daughters ' hearts ...
against their father ,
let not women' s weapons , water drops , stain my cheeks . !
" no , you unnatural hags , i will have such revenges on you both ...
faster ! " that all the world shall i will do such things
" what they are , yet i know not , but they shall be the terrors of the earth .
faster !
you think i' il weep .
i' il have full cause of weeping : but this heart shall break into a hundred thousand flaws , or ere i' il weep .
o fool , i shall go mad !
come on , ted .
yet herein will i imitate the sun who doth permit the base contagious clouds to smother up his beauty from the world .
that , when he please again to be himself , being wanted , he may be more wondered at ...
by breaking through the foul and ugly mists of vapors that did seem to strangle him .
faster .
and when they seldom come , they wish' d for come , and nothing pleaseth but rare accidents .
so , when this loose behavior i throw off and pay the debt i never promised ,
and , like bright metal on a sullen ground , my reformation , glitt' ring o' er my fault , faster . " shall show more goodly and attract more eyes than that which hath no foil to set it off .
i' il so offend to make offense a skill , redeeming time when men think least i will .
you buggers .
morecambe , again .
okay .
ah , dearjuliet , why art thou yet so fair ?
shall i believe that unsubstantial death is amorous , and that the lean abhorred monster keeps thee here in dark to be his paramour ?
for fear of that i still will stay with thee , " and never from this palace of dim night depart again .
here .
here will i remain with worms that are thy chambermaids .
o you ...
the doors of breath , seal with a righteous kiss ... a dateless bargain to engrossing death !
here' s to my love .
thus with a kiss ...
i die .
how did you get the scar ?
i tried to kill myself three years ago .
i broke into the box where my mother kept the sleeping pills .
went down to the basement , into the crawl space underneath the house .
and i took them , and i went to sleep .
did you ever have something that you wanted to erase ?
no .
and ?
and i took too many of the damn things , and i puked them up .
then three days later my mother and brother found me and pulled me out .
and what about the scar ?
i ripped my cheek on the concrete when they pulled me out .
a memento mori .
yes .
because i was dead .
only i rose up again .
like lazarus lady lazarus .
that' s me .
you wouldn' t do that if you knew .
what ?
what was down there .
jesus christ !
what' s that ?
look .
very intelligent , cows .
did you know that ?
really ?
not a lot of people give them credit .

milton or chaucer ?

how do you do ?
my , aren' t you the catch of the day .
ted is going to be a great poet .
his last book won what was that ?
the new york center poetry prize .
it' s rather good .
it' s the , uh , hawk in the rain .
really wonderful .
you read it ?
yes .
of course .
what did you think of the poem about the giraffe ?
oh , listen to that accent .
there wasn' t a poem about a giraffe .
say something else .
i need a drink .
uh , excuse me , ladies .
this sylvia' s father ?
mm hmm .
yes .
bumblebees were his specialty .
it' s all he ever thought about .
before the war , back in germany , his colleagues always called him der bienenknig .
that means king of the bees .
yes , that' s right .
that was otto .
king of the bees .
you must forgive my friends , ted .
they , uh , haven' t had the advantages you have .
and what might they be ?
having to fight for what you want .
that' s why she' s in love with you , you know .
sylvia , i mean .
oh , my god .
there were oh , there were
i don' t i don' t mean to sound disloyal , but there were ... a lot of other boys , but they didn' t scare her .
she rather frightened them , i think .
you' re
you' re very different .
but i think you frightened her , and that' s why she likes you .
you think i' d hurt her .
no , i wouldn' t hurt her .
do you know that we found her right where you' re standing ?
right under there , near the boards .
we thought she was dead , she was so pale , so white .
some people want to be found .
sylvia didn' t .
she just ... crawled into a hole and waited to die .
be good to her .
always .
hi .
hope you like fish .
wow , look at those .
my god .
did you have fun ?
uh huh .
it finally cooled down .
it was so hot earlier , wasn' t it ?
you tell me .
i look a bit ... messy because i started baking , and i made
baking ?
i made one real cream cake , but it went a bit funny in the center .
i just decided to throw it out and start over .
but the funny thing is , the second one looks nicer than the first one anyway .
i thought you were gonna write .
do you know , some husbands would be happy that their wives ... stayed home and baked them some nice cakes .
i am happy .
i' d just be happier if you were writing .
i' ve got the whole summer to write .
how was your walk ?
good .
got a poem .
a good one .
you ?
i' m dried up .
that' s ' cause you' ve got nothing to say .
i' m not a real writer .
never will be .
i' m no good .
you make great cakes .
you know what your trouble is ?
i have a husband who thinks he can tell me how to write poetry ?
there' s no secret to it .
you' ve just gotta pick a subject and ... stick your head into it .
you' ve got to write .
that' s what poets do .
yes , well , that' s easy for you to say .
you go out for a bike ride and come back with an epic in hexameters .
i sit down to write , i get a bake sale .
do you know what
do you know what my trouble is ?
is that i don' t have a subject .
the novel , falcon yard , what' s that about ?
it' s ... about a girl who meets a boy .
no .
what' s it really about ?
you and me .
what' s it really about ?
me .
a girl who spends her summer at the beach ?
no , see no , that' s not really me .
yes , it is .
you told me it was about you .
what i' m trying to say is that you' ve already got your subject .
it' s you .
and you keep skirting round the issue .
you keep flowering it up .
you keep  all right , all right , all right .
shit .
jesus christ .
what ?
the tide' s dragging us out .
i' m not gonna get us back in .
people drown like this .
i tried to drown myself once .
i swam out in the sea as far as i could , but it just spat me out like a cork .
i guess it didn' t want me .
you know , it' s funny ,
i was always happy until i was nine years old .
i was always in one piece .
then my father died .
those were pearls that were his eyes .
' destroy . !
destroy . !
destroy . ! ' " hums the underconsciousness . " ' love and produce . !
love and produce . ! ' " cackles the upper consciousness .
and the world hears only the ' love and produce ' cackle .
refuses to hear the hum of destruction underneath ...
until such time as it will have to hear .
the american has got to destroy !
it is his destiny .
and finally , this ... poem by yeats , i think ... illustrates ... that point rather well .
well , at least i hope it does .
excuse me .
the sorrow of love .
the quarrel of the sparrows in the eaves ,
the full round moon and the star laden sky ,
and the loud song of the ever singing leaves ,
had hid away earth' s old and weary cry .
and then you came ...
with those red mournful lips ,
and with you came the whole of the world' s tears ,
and all the sorrows ofher laboring ships ,
and all the burden ofher myriad years .
and now the sparrows warring in the eaves ,
the crumbling moon , the white stars in the sky ,
and the loud chanting of the unquiet leaves , are shaken with earth' s old and weary cry .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you very much .
that' s very kind .
take care .
i was so impressed .
bye .
yeah .
bye bye .
thank you .
mr. hughes , uh , your voice so powerful .
but , uh , what did you think of the words ?
the words ?
so when is your next book coming out ?
well , when i' ve written it .
oh , it must be wonderful to be married to such a great poet .
yes , it is .
it is .
would you excuse us for just a moment ?
sure .
excuse me .
i' m sorry .
i just i' m so exhausted , and i' ve got a stack of papers this high to get through .
do you mind if we go now or in a minute ?
i' m gonna have to say thanks to merwin for that review .
and len baskin' s here , so i who' s len baskin ?
len baskin .
he organized all this .

right .
so look , take the car .
all right .
i' il see you later .

no .
he said he' d look at my poetry .
he said it would be okay .
i' m sorry if i disturbed you .
yeah .
who is she ?
she' s nobody .
a student .
she was ... in that creative writing class i i talked to .
she' d written all these poems .
i took pity on her .
you think i' m fucking her .
are you ?
oh , for christ' s sake !
this place is really getting to you , isn' t it ?
this bunch of dried up , malicious old women ... who think their men are gonna get a taste for fresh meat .
as a matter of fact , i' m not fucking her .
but if i do start fucking the students , you' il be the first to know .
last night i
i was very tired .
i
i' ve organized everything so i won' t i won' t be quite so tired , um
i' m sorry .
it' s not just you .
it' s me as well .
i can' t write here .
we should go back to england .
and live on what ?
we' il survive , lovely .
do you see that ?
that' s the world .
page 1 4 , on line line 1 4 .
yes .
page 1 4 , line 1 4 .
there is an " e " yes .
no , two .
two " p " ' s .
will you get that ?
uh , page 40 .
yes .
next line eight .
next the new moon' s curve .
oh , those guys are all the same .
i mean , i wouldn' t have thought right .
right .
i mean , after hawk in the rain , they , uh
no . the literary establishment were all hoping your next book would be an ... anticlimax .
but i' m pleased to say you' ve confounded them and outdone yourself .
it' s really quite wonderful .
on the back page .
in the back jacket .
uh , i' ve just made some coffee .
would you like a cup ?
well , i think you can speak to the agent about that .
all right ?
hello .
hello .
you must be mr. alvarez .
yes , indeed .
and you must be mrs. hughes ?
night shift " ?
uh
night shift . " it' s a poem you printed in the observer .
oh , yes .
night shift . " yes .
it was a good poem .
well , yes , i know .
i wrote it .
oh , you' re sylvia plath .
i am .
oh .
nice to meet you .
and you .
uh , tell me , have you written any others or yes , i have .
actually , i have a , uh , book of poems coming out very shortly called the colossus .
i' d love to read them .
thank you .
it would be an honor .
i spoke to george about it last week and , uh , he was quite optimistic .
it might take another six months .
the whole thing , it' s about putting a face to a name .
for them to put , you know , your name to duh , duh , duh , and likewise .
i mean , we' ve got charlie hetheringham here from the t. l. s.
there' s robinson from the critical quarterly .
that one there ?
yeah .
and , um , there' s , uh , the telegraph there and the times .
and , uh oh, yes, you see that chap with the big ears ?
he' s easy .
he' s from the listener .
so , it' s a good turnout, you know .
that' s a good sign , isn' t it , that they all came ?
well , yes , of course .
i mean , don' t get your hopes up too high , but , yes it is .
it really is .
they' re all bloody civil servants moonlighting as journalists .
it' s their job to protect the status quo .
that' s the toughest .
mr. robinson .
mr. robinson .
you forgot this .
oh , uh , thanks .
do you think you might be reviewing it ?
this ?
i shouldn' t think so .
we just got the new pasternak .
then betjeman' s out next week , and there' s an e . e . cummings in the pipeline .
not in the same league , really , is she , this sylvia
plath .
poor thing .
can' t be easy for her , being married to that .
still , good party .
thank the boss .
this is good .
what ?
by alvarez .
very good .
listen .
her poems rest secure in a mass of experience ... that is never quite brought out into daylight .
then there' s a quote , and it says ,
it is this sense of threat , as though she were continually menaced ...
by something she could see only out of the corner of her eye ... that gives her work its distinction .
what about the rest ?
it' s a good review .
one review ?
but it' s a good review .
look , it' s hard .
you know it' s gonna be hard .
my first book won prizes .
i' il get it .
hello .

yeah .
oh , no , certainly .
certainly .
um
yes .

the sea was still breaking violently and night had steamed ... into our north atlantic fleet when the drowned sailor clutched the dragnet .
light flashed from his matted head and marble feet .
he grappled at the net with the coiled , hurdling muscles of his thighs .
the corpse was bloodless a botch of reds and whites
i' m gonna do the washing up .
i' il help .
no , i' m fine .
no , i insist .
... on a stranded hulk heavy with sand .
i' il wash , you dry .
yes . ... and heave it seaward whence it came ... where the heel headed dogfish barks ... its nose on ahab' s void and forehead ... and the name is blocked in yellow chalk .
what is going on ?
nothing' s going on .
assia was just telling me about a dream she' d had .
can i help with anything ?
i' d like you and assia to leave first thing in the morning .
it' s just that i' m tired .
i' m so tired , and i
you don' t know what i' ve been through .
i' ve got two small children .
if you had children of your own , you would understand .
i' m sorry .
of course .
when will you be back ?
i don' t know .
a couple of days , maybe three .
depends how long it takes .
what number will you be at ?
i haven' t decided who i' m gonna stay with yet .
i think people are getting pretty sick of me sleeping on their floors .
so , i' il probably just check into a bed and breakfast .
you don' t have to go , you know .
yes , i do .
sylvia ?
the truth comes to me .
the truth loves me .
hello ?
i know who you are .
hello .
get out .
this is the light of the mind .
if the moon smiled , she would resemble you .
their redness talks to my wound .
she would drag me , cruelly , being barren .
thick , red and slipping
your nakedness shadows our safety .
whose is that long white box on the grove ?
they can die , i need feed them nothing .
i sizzled in his blue
our cheesecloth gauntlets neat and sweet
bare handed i hand the combs .
the man in white smiles
so i can' t see what is in there .
some god got hold of me
lightly , through their white swaddlings , like an awful baby
a world of bald white days in a shadeless socket .
i cannot undo myself , and the train is steaming
the upflight of the murderess
and the villagers never liked you .
they are dancing and stamping on you .
they always knew it was you .
daddy , daddy , you bastard , i' m through .
it' s , uh
it' s what ?
what is it ?
is it any good ?
good ?
oh , god , yes .
that " daddy " poem , the use of metaphor , the way it builds at the end ... out of the blackness into an explosion of fury , it' s just stunning .
i' m thinking of moving back to london .
i' il send you some more as soon as i' m settled .
i' d like that .
sylvia .
i know this must have been hard on you .
no .
really , i' ve never been happier .
and i' ve never written more .
it' s as if ... now he' s gone , i' m free .
i can finally write .
i wake up between 3 : 00 and 4 : 00 , ' cause that' s the worst time , and i write till dawn .
i really feel like god is speaking through me .
and now we need the little purple star .
go up here .
put all of them on .
we' ve got the snowflake .
all right .
where' s he gonna live ?
mm , there .
she looks beautiful .
hello ?
hello ?
all right .
i' m very sorry to bother you .
i' m i' m i' m
i live upstairs and my lights have gone out .
i' ve got no hot water .
i' ve got my children up there and i' m there' s been a power cut .
the moment you need heat and light to sustain life itself , the government cuts the electricity .
why ?
to build the national character .
now , leave your stove on for heat and to boil water for washing .
here' s some spare candles , yeah , and some and some matches .
there you are .
thank you .
you must think i' m some stupid american bitch .
oh , no , not at all .
i assumed you were canadian .
yes .
well , thank you .
pleasure .
thank you very much .
bye bye .
hello , sweetheart .
this one' s for you .
happy christmas , darling .
i didn' t just come to see them .
i wanted to see you .
wanted to see how you are .
i' ve missed you .
i' ve missed you all .
christmas is bloody hard .
can we can we talk ?
can we sit down ?
are you still fucking her ?
i have fallen a long way .
the moon sees nothing of this .
and the message of the yew tree is blackness blackness and silence .
i don' t know what else to do .
i can' t
i can' t go back to her , but i love her so much it' s
do you want another one ?
mm .
thank you .
this one is extraordinary .
and , uh , " lady lazarus , " the one about the , uh the failed suicides the despair , the overpowering sense of foreboding , and yet without a trace ... of anger or hysteria ... or any appeal for sympathy .
the the wealth of imagery .
such horrors , but expressed with , um with a coolness ,
like a like a murderer' s confession .
so [ clears throat ]
have you got a title for your novel yet ?
the bell jar .
when' s it coming out ?
the new year .
are you gonna let me read it ?
it' s a potboiler .
could you get me an ashtray ?
sure .
i didn' t know you smoked .
i don' t .
but i' m starting .
i' m thinking of trying some new things .
really ?
like what ?
i' m thinking of taking a lover .
oh , how glamorous .
who is he ?
look , i know how you feel .
no , you don' t .
i do .
we have we share in common a
i
i tried to i tried to
how ?
uh , same as you .
sleeping pills .
i , uh i took too many .
everybody does , don' t they ?
sometimes i feel like i' m not ... solid .
i' m hollow .
there' s ... nothing behind my eyes .
i' m a negative of a person .
it' s as if i never
i never thought anything .
i never wrote ... anything , i never felt anything .
all i want is blackness blackness and silence .
look , one thing i do know about death ... is it is not a a reunion or a homecoming .
there' s there' s no
your life doesn' t flash before you and the missing piece of you clicks into place .
it' s just there' s just fuck all .
there' s nothing .
so what do you do when your life ... gets as bad as it can ... and just keeps getting worse ?
you just keep going .
look .
listen .
you are so beautiful .
and you' ve you' ve a wonderful mind .
and you are a great a great poet .
and you and ted , you understand each other in ways that that other people can only dream about .
so , for god' s sakes , don' t throw it all away just because
i don' t want to hear her name .
i was gonna say just because of an affair .
are you all right ?
come in .
sit here .
i' m gonna die .
i' m gonna die soon .
who' s gonna take care of my babies ?
mrs. hughes , i don' t understand .
what do you mean , you' re going to die ?
are you ill ?
have you been ill or
no , i' m not ill .
i think i really should call the doctor .
no , no , don' t call a doctor .
don' t you know what they do ?
they hook you up to the eastern grid and fill you full of sparks .
yeah .
i' m sorry .
no , i' m sorry .
i' m just so on edge , i
i' m just so on edge , i
oh , god , it' s all my fault , it' s all my fault , it' s all my fault .
all i could think about is what would happen if ... somebody took him away from me .
you see , if you fear something enough , you can make it happen .
that woman ,
i conjured her .
i invented her .
do you understand ?
no , i' m sorry .
i don' t .
it' s just that i' m so tired , i' m so tired , i' m
if i could just sleep a little bit , just a little bit
i' m just so exhausted .
perhaps we could get someone to look after your children .
oh , my god !
i left them upstairs !
no , don' t go .
i' il go and check , see if they' re all right .
would you like me to do that ?
you stay there .
you' re a very nice man .
mm , no .
you remind me a little of my father .
yes , hello , kate .
it' s sylvia .
i' m all right .
i' m
i was wondering if i could come round and see you .
i see .
okay .
dr. hawkins , it' s sylvia .
i [ sobs ]
i need help .
i
you look ... very nice .
you' d better come in .
would you like a drink ?
please .
what do you want , sylvia ?
i wanted to see you .
i thought that you ... might like to see us .
i thought there was something wrong .
alvarez said you tried to make a pass at him .
and i' ve been told you' ve been taking pills .
no .
god , i missed you .
i almost went mad .
we' re not even two people .
even before we met , we were just ... these two halves ... walking around with big ... gaping holes in us shaped like the other person .
and then we found each other and we were finally a whole .
but then it' s as if we couldn' t stand being happy , so we ripped we ripped ourselves in half again .
in the spring , we should go back to devon .
we' il go back to devon and it' il just be us ... and the children and our work .
it' il be like this whole thing never happened .
and the summer and the fall and this awful winter it' il all fade by the time the leaves come out .
and it' il just seem like some nightmare that was never real .
you don' t love her like you love me .
you' il never have with her what you have with me .
you know that .
i know .
leave her .
i can' t .
she' s pregnant .
oh .
everything all right ?
do you have any stamps ?
it' s silly , i know , but i' ve got , uh
i' ve gotta post some letters to america tonight and i airmail , and i don' t have any stamps .
well , can' t you post them in the morning ?
no .
no , i' ve got i' ve got a nurse coming in the morning .
you see , there' s a nurse coming .
and , anyway , i won' t be here in the morning .
oh , i see .
yes , i think i' ve got some .
here we are .
thank you .
stamps .
thanks .
thank you .
well , good night .
good night .
look , do you want me to call someone ?
no .
no , i was just having
i just had the most beautiful ... dream .
i love you , sweetheart .
the box is locked .
it is dangerous .
there are no windows , so i can' t see what is in there .
there is only a little grid .
no exit .
