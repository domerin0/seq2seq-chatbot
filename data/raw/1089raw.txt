that was unreal .
yeah , it was nice .
nice ?
but you were calling out my name .
you were banging my head into the headboard and singing .
it hurt .
why didn' t you say something ?
i just wanted you to finish .
oh , this isn' t right !
well , did you at least ... you know ... ?
no , freddy , i didn' t come .
look , don' t worry about it , ok ?
oh , for christ' s sake !
pay attention !
you might learn something .
i hated music at first .
seriously .
no !
i don' t want to !
but my parents were determined .
i mean , they really tried , man .
no , no , no , stop !
how many times ... ?
after the banjo , the trumpet , the piccolo and the accordion , guess what came next .
go on , guess .
summer of ' 85 .
first time i' d been in a record shop .
i was with my date .
ok , baby sitter .
that was the moment the lights just blazed on .
that was the day i knew i was destined to be a rock star .
unfortunately , i was a generation late .
by the time i was ready , live music in sydney was flatlining .
pokies .
why people sat there fitting their week' s wages down a slot was anyone' s guess .
profits ruled .
live music just couldn' t compete .
it was now up to the labels to make sure we had cutting edge artistes to choose from .
i' ve been waiting for this .
her last album was great .
have you heard " scent of my love " ?
i love that song .
i had a band .
we rocked hard .
well , we would' ve .
after a year of rehearsing , all we needed was a gig , but that was proving pretty tough .
then one day , just like on an mtv special ...
shaw' s records .
freddy , it' s bruno .
bruno , how are you ?
gig ?
yeah , right , mate .
it' s not my birthday .
no bullshit .
it' s for real .
you serious ?
yeah .
yeah !
bruno , you rock !
the guys are gonna be stoked !
one phone call .
one gig .
it can change your whole life .
destiny , man .
oi !
you !
we should open with that song , definitely .
no , it' s a better closer .
hook ' em with the ballad , then jerk off with the arty shit .
it' s not arty shit , bruno .
it' s just an expression , you big ...
guys !
guys !
take it easy .
we' ve finally got a gig , right ?
oh , jesus , a gig .
my hands are shaking .
ah .
flop sweat .
a little something to soothe those nerves ?
mm , let me think .
and how do they rate next to rat poison ?
i give them a 6 . 8 on the luce o meter .
a nice , level high .
oh , really ?
brunes , you did the gig guide , right ?
does the queen wipe her own arse ?
everyone and their dog' s gonna be there tomorrow night .
relax .
when i' m finished , you' il be headlining homebake !
all right !
let' s do it again .
count us in , luce .
one , two , three , four !
not again !
fuck .
bruno' s onto it .
oi !
grandpa !
you do that one more time , i' il plug in your walker , and a thousand volts will sizzle the scraggly white hairs on your balls !
dickhead .
good one , brunes .
are ... you ... ready ?
dad .
yeah .
that was pretty bloody pathetic .
are ... you ... ready ?
yeah !
dad , please .
suck more piss !
all right !
first gig !
i remember our first gig with the boomawangs , back in seventy ...
six .
' 76 .
the singer got hit with a beer bottle .
a chunk of glass went right in his eyeball .
and he kept ...
kept on singing .
kate !
katie !
got my eye on you , baby !
isn' t that how you got the pirate thing ?
yeah , yeah .
career maker that bastard was .
found this in the second hand bin .
klss and make up .
gee , thanks , kate .
so , are you guys psyched or what ?
yeah !
oh , my god !
aren' t you , like , with that band ?
you must have me confused with someone else .
bruno !
you pig .
that' s heavy .
i wouldn' t .
yeah ?
i could bench press your arse no strain , drummer boy .
hey , that killer opener you' re having trouble with ?
i' ve some ideas for the lyric .
who' s a pig now , eh ?
oh , brunes !
wait , wait .
don' t say anything yet .
anything to say to people watching at home ?
i am luscious lucy .
let the snare bite and the high hat hiss , for i am the best drummer in the world !
you' re not , luce .
so tan , how we feelin ' ?
i think i' m gonna be sick .
all right .
all right .
freddy .
yo .
how are those vocal chords , man ?
strong , smooth and ready to rumble !
so , you' re feelin ' pretty good then ?
yeah .
it' s what it' s all about , man .
we' re gonna remember this night for ever .
all right .
we' re gonna take a break , so nobody leave .
tan , you' re pushin ' too hard .
you' re anticipating the crash .
what i' m anticipating is my bass wrapped round your head .
what ?
as manager of a band who are supposed to play tonight , i' m entitled to free drinks !
mate , your band' s name ain' t on my list .
in a pinch management ?
freddy , where the hell are you ?
i' m at the duke of york .
where the hell do you think i am ?
the duke of clarence ?
i' m fucking positive it was the duke of york .
it was the clarence , you fucking idiot !
i' m goin ' into a tunnel .
hey , brune .
when do we start ?
that idiot is sacked .
we were just managed up shit creek .
let' s go to a real pub , yeah ?
yeah .
coming , aren' t you ?
i' m not really up for it .
joe !
jesus , one drink .
you haven' t talked to me all night .
i' il catch you later , ok ?
four schooners , thanks , thommo .
freddy .
how' s life ?
don' t ask .
actually , i' il tell you how life is , thommo .
pretty shitty , mate .
here we are , musicians with somethin ' to say and no place to say it .
why ? " , you ask .
because certain publicans i know are employing pricks like him instead of real musicians like us .
all just to save a quick buck .
you make me feel like such an enemy of art .
yeah .
well , when you' re ready to book a real band , let me know .
man , we could rock the tits off this place .
sure thing .
next slot that opens up , you' il be the fourth or fifth out of work band i call .
promise .
hang in there with your music , champ .
before a feast , there must be famine .
mate , your wallet !
feast !
it' s such a sexual game .
balls , stick ...
choice of holes .
you lubricate ...
then choose your position .
were you breast fed ?
oh , yeah .
cos studies link sexual obsession and the lack of mummy' s tit .
too soft , humiliation .
too hard ...
well .
you can never be too hard .
beer ?
certainly .
what did you think ?
honestly .
i thought it was going really well till the guy turned the greyhound races up .
at least his dog lost .
i don' t know , katie .
it' s all i' ve ever wanted , you know ?
just to be up on stage and have everyone loving my music as much as i do .
maybe it' s just a stupid dream .
yeah , i guess .
what ?
it' s only stupid if you give it up .
yeah , well , i won' t be doin ' that in a hurry .
you don' t think joe' s got someone else , do you ?
he' d have to be insane .
you know what he' s like .
yeah , i suppose .
c' mon , tan , let' s jam .
no , not till i beat this depraved bastard .
catch you later .
see you .
joe , you fill me so perfectly .
it' s like someone' s poured plaster inside me , pulled it out , and stuck that exact mould right on your balls .
you smell great , angie .
i like it here .
so dark .
so still , joe .
joe ?
you ever think about suicide ?
oh , angie ...
then my parents walk in .
what did you do ?
handed the joint to kev and told them it was his idea .
that' s when we started rehearsing in the penthouse .
thanks for the lift .
no worries .
hold on a sec .
it does that .
so , you mentioned some lyrics ?
yeah .
i don' t know if they' re what you' re looking for , it' s just a few ideas i had over coffee .
wow , this is unreal !
wait , what' s that word ?
people " ?
" pimple .
pimple !
that' s even better !
katie , this is poetry , man .
you think so ?
yeah !
fucking kate !
what ?
i said " fucking great !
maybe they forgot to mention it .
i heard it on the radio myself .
the gig guide .
they gave our number and said we need a manager .
face it , mate , no one wants to manage us .
it was only an hour ago .
take it easy .
hello ?
yes , we are still looking for a manager , actually .
yeah , we could hang around .
are you far ?
no .
pretty friggin ' close .
bruno , listen ...
i' m mindin ' my own biz on the crapper , givin ' birth to a bruno loaf , when i hear this bullshit on the radio .
my arsehole snaps shut like a mousetrap .
you messed up the gig .
one little mistake .
fuck you very much .
you' ve never made a mistake , you little fairy ?
guys .
no .
give me another chance .
just one more chance !
no .
i ...
i' m the manager .
don' t crush my dreams .
i' d rather be dead !
do something , freddy .
what ?
i don' t have a gun .
c' mon , freddy .
do somethin ' .
what ?
make him our roadie ?
roadie ?
joe , we' ve been mates since the squid days .
you know i' d never tread on your turf .
it' s just , you and katie .
i mean ...
things just don' t seem to be goin ' that well , and i just figured that if ... you know , if i ... ... the australian rock awards , sprimp' s debut album shot to platinum in four weeks flat , under the guidance of manager of the year , shad kern .
however , the band had ...
holy shit !
kern management , please hold .
yes ?
i' m here to see shad kern .
do you have an appointment ?
no , but i have his wallet .
no way !
no fucking way does sprimp do support for anybody .
i don' t care if they' re rock icons .

thanks .
you know the best thing about this industry ?
well , people call it an industry , but i prefer the term " playpen .

nyet ?
i didn' t think so .
tanya , listen .

look , it' s time to move on .
new girlfriend .
new bass player .
what the fuck is in me ? !
my quick unpick .

can you pull it out ?
good advice .
you should' ve followed it .
tanya , please .

and to think , this is how i' il always remember you .
freddy , i' m glad you' re here .
ex girlfriend coming through .
tanya ...
listen , there' s nothing going on .
i told him i hadn' t even kissed another guy , and then i remembered you , and itjust kind of slipped out .
then he said he always thought we were screwing around , so i said " well , you can think what you like .
i feel awful about you and tanya .
that' s all right .
she was always a bit of a pain in the arse .
so , are you ok ?
yeah .
no , i ...
i don' t know .
everything' s just all over the place .
things' il get better .

you won' t be disappointed , shad !
mr kern !

all we need is a gig .

it' s " magical mystery gig that' il never happen " time again .
thommo' s gonna rent us this place .
brilliant .
and that parsimonious prick is doing this to win the nobel prize for humanity ?
yeah .
and 1200 bucks .
that' s all we' ve gotta guarantee him .
we keep the door and get drinks at staff prices .
cool .
but where are we gonna get 1200 bucks ?
can' t you sell some of your pills ?
no way .
that makes me a pusher , amigo .
tan , what about your parents ?
no .
god .
next stupid idea ?
i' ve got one .
there' s no point even talking about it unless we know that joe' s in .
bust up ?
go back with that slut ?
kate is not a slut .
that' s why she' s got her tongue down the throat of your best friend .
angie , don' t .
let' s ask little joe what he thinks .
stop it .
oh , g' day , big fella .
joe' s upstairs .
thanks , kev .
how you keepin ' , man ?
tops , matey .
i' d forgotten how good cornflakes were .
this is ...
it' s not normal , angie .
fuck normal .
who wants normal ?
i do .
and kate' s normal .
having a baby is normal .
i need lots of ... normal .
do you always ejaculate over a girl when you' re trying to break up with her ?
it' s original , i' il give you that .
are you crazy ?
put some antiseptic on it .
jesus .
think you can get rid of me ?
you' il never get rid of me , joe .
ever .
look , you are a mind blowing fuck , but we have to cool it , ok ?
what do you want ?
what ?
you idiot .
katie' s pregnant and you' re cheating on her .
no , i' m not .
look , not now .
i was just breaking up with her , all right ?
i came to tell you sprimp' s manager wants to see a gig .
you gotta come up with 240 bucks , fast .
you don' t deserve her , man .
oh , and you do ?
oh , freddy ?
try and use this against me with kate and you can forget the fucking band .
i mean it .
i can' t guarantee they' il be 100 % smooth , but your donations will really help my research .
i' m a seven foot tall blonde amazon goddess with violet eyes and breasts so big they meet behind my back .
no , mate .
sod off !
i can' t guarantee they' il be 100 % smooth ...
fuck you too , you degenerate floating cake of whale shit !
jesus !
you sexy degenerate , you .
here you go .
that' s not an official wilderness society suit !
you' re a fake !
you' re the fake .
you' re dead !
fuck you , man !
and don' t come back !
this time joe' s gone too far .
he' s deluded himself before , but not like this .
why does he always say things he doesn' t really mean ?
i mean , could he think about my feelings forjust a minute ?
it' s like at a party when there' s one piece of cheese left on the plate .
the person next to you obviously wants it , but makes a point of offering it to you first .
stuff like that really shits me .
i love it when it rains .
for a moment , everything' s new again .
... ready to rumble !
you' re feelin ' pretty good then ?
yeah .
it' s what it' s all about , man .
we' il remember this night for ever .
dumplings ?
it' s great .
things are going so well for you .
yeah , well , we' ve only raised 100 bucks .
you' il get there .
i was just worried you and joe were gonna bust up the band over all this .
so , have you finished that song we wrote ?
the killer opener ?
i' m still working on it .
think it' il turn out ok ?
i hope so .
some days , don' t you wish you could just escape ?
joe and i are over .
how did he take it ?
he doesn' t know yet .
it' s the right thing for both of us .
he just hasn' t been around for me to tell him .
sorry , you were saying ?
no .
it' s nothing .
nothing .
hey , you want the last one ?
no , no , you ...
yeah , you do .
you reckon anybody likes fortune cookies ?
joe .
where' ve you been ?
the family planning centre .
they suggested that the father to be ...
father to be ?
yeah .
that he watch something for 24 hours .
teaches responsibility .
what are you talking about ?
meet melly .
most blokes only look after it for a day , i' m gonna do it for a whole month .
joe ...
just watch me .
i' il get my shit together , you' il see .
i will not let her out of my sight , ever .
joe , what you' re doing is great .
but you and me , the way that it' s been ...
i' ve changed .
you' il see .
it' s not gonna work .
it' s over .
freddy' s not the guy for you , kate .
i know he' s not .
please , joe , don' t do this .
just give me a chance , ok ?
i can be normal .
watch me .
it' s nap time .
so we' il see you later .
everything' s gonna be fine .
i guarantee it .
you were right , freddy .
they didn' t even check the date .
brunes .
brunes !
focus .
the idea is to get shad to come to rehearsal , save a thousand bucks , yeah ?
he' il be on the side of the stage .
wait here .
what if i see him first ?
find me .
what if there' s no time ?
find me .
no cheating .
shadling !
you said you' d listen to the whole demo .
baby .
you know i think you' ve got a great sound .
then manage me .
i' il manage you ...
... if you leave toby .
that' s so romantic .
but you know that' s not an option .
we don' t wanna rock the boat , do we ?
i think you should listen to track two .
oh , hey .
shad .
it' s bruno .
in a pinch management ?
oh , yeah ...
shad , look , i know you said you' d come to our next gig and all , but we thought maybe you' d like to come to a rehearsal instead , you know ?
get ajump on the whole ...
c' mon , baby , don' t play with me now .
you really do have to hear them live ...
shad , is this a good time for you ?
no !
don' t you dare tease me !
yeah !
the demo rocks !
what do you mean ...
oh !
ah !
a demo ?
fuck , yes !
the truth is , we can' t afford to do a demo ...
i love the demo !
oh , give it to me .
you' re saying you' d give it a serious listen ?
now you' ve got it !
oh , here we go !
i get it !
we' re just going to have to get you one then !
you won' t be sorry , shad .
i' il be in touch , all right ?
i' il get the contracts drawn up tomorrow .
they caught you in the make up room , so they checked the pass .
what' s it matter ?
now we know what shad wants a demo .
great .
now instead of finding a grand , we' ve gotta find three !
you are not gonna believe what joe' s gone and done .
so you know ?
you' ve met his little friend ?
yeah .
katie , i' m so sorry .
you are ?
course .
couldn' t believe he screwed around on you .
i tried to tell you , but a plane flew over , and you said it was over anyway , so i figured the band was going really well , and shad wanted to ...
you didn' t know ?
i came to talk to you about joe buying a melon as a baby substitute , but you' re telling me that all this time he' s been having an affair , and you didn' t tell me about it for the sake of your worthless fucking band ?
yeah , but ...
how selfish can you get ?
to think i actually thought that you and i ...
but that was all bullshit .
no , that was real !
i understand how you feel ...
freddy , you have no idea .
i trusted you .
how do you open this fucking door ?
just pull it .
breaking up' s the best thing that ever happened to me .
free to roam , free to rage , free to have a freakin ' orgasm occasionally ...
what' s wrong with guys today ?
they couldn' t find their way around a supermarket , let alone a woman' s body .
oh , my god .
feeding time on the planet of the apes .
oh , shit , tan .
if only it wasn' t so tragically hip to be bi these days .
to subjugate is to make subservient or submissive .
false .
incorrect .
precognition is the ability to see into the future .
what , like me and you going out on a date or something ?
dream on , dickhead .
hello ?
katie , it' s me ...
oh , what ? !
aha !
a hole in one , right there .
one night stands seem weird to me .
sex with a stranger is the thrill of the unexpected .
one minute you' re sitting in a pub , the next , you' re buck naked with a tongue rooting around your bunghole .
maybe i don' t feel like planting my heels on the ceiling and yelling " come and get it !
sexual frustration can be frustrating .
have you seen what' s going on ?
no .
thommo ?
what' s the story ?
what story would that be , freddo ?
ah .
well , laddie , once upon a time there was a barman named thommo , who got sick of selling alcoholic refreshment to losers and half wits in a shit part of town .
so he sold half his equity to the evil development man , who turned around and filled his joint with pokies .
and then thommo lived happily ever after , sailing around the world on his gigantic fuckin ' yacht .
what' s more important , thommo ?
us ?
we' ve supported you for years .
or pimpin ' out your pub for a quick buck ?
what about the bands , man ?
what about ' em ?
i now officially consider you the enemy .
come on , guys , let' s get outta here .
i' il send you a postcard , you dick .
god , a demo ?
they' re so expensive !
shad was practically begging me for it .
jeez , tan , we can' t pass this up .
yeah .
come on .
no !
the answer' s no .
come on .
you know how tight they are .
look , any money given comes with serious psychological strings attached .
all right !
but we do it my way or we don' t do it at all .
and you all have to be there .
even joe .
told you she' d crack .
just have to put the pressure on .
kate ?
nah , nah .
cornflakes ?
no , i' m good .
nah , the only time kate came round was to drop off a garbage bag full of joe' s stuff .
she didn' t wanna talk to him .
all right .
thanks , kev .
freddy ...
he really screwed it up good , didn' t he ?
yeah .
we both did .
well , we' re musos .
we' re meant to screw up when it comes to women .
i' il see you around , kev .
hey .
giant squid was pretty cool , hey ?
remember that gig we played ...
you' re being rude .
what ?
you didn' t say hello .
yeah , i did .
i just said ...
to melly .
hey , melly .
anyway , remember the gig ...
don' t try to memory lane me .
we could use that feeling .
old news , mate .
we' re better now .
you and i are stronger than this bullshit , aren' t we ?
yeah , and what about you and kate ?
for some reason , i didn' t think you' d mind .
she' s my girl .
i know .
itjust didn' t seem like it .
anyway , whatever , man .
look , i' m here about the band .
this is our chance .
i' m telling you , i' m gonna make this thing happen .
and if you want to come along for the ride , then ... well , that' d be really cool .
it' s up to you .
great .
joe' s lost it .
it' s a difficult time .
and for me .
you don' t see me breast feeding mangoes .
melons .
whatever !
is the table set ?
maybe i should put on some music .
no , it' il just make them tense .
oh , guys , i' m sorry i' m late , but melly was a little bit grumpy on the way over .
joe , please , no melons !
just for tonight .
shouldn' t little mellys be in bed by now ?
relax !
here ' s to bleeding your parents dry .
i envy you musicians .
no cares , no money worries .
no money !
yeah .
a rich guy like you must be so stressed out you can' t even take a dump without an accountant present .
yeah !
yeah .
freddy , could you give me a hand , please ?
sure .
excuse me .
this is all wrong .
there' s no way i can ask them for money tonight .
c' mon , chill , tan .
you can do it .
ease us through .
we' il murder lucy later .
goin ' pretty well out there , eh ?
i feel kind of weird , man .
an early phase that passes .
what ?
nothin ' .
all right , i slipped something in the shots .
you guys needed to relax .
dude , i' m hallucinating !
impossible .
be cool .
trust me , it' s very mild .
look at me .
i' m as solid as a rock .
i' m so glad you came over , because i wanted to say thank you for everything you' ve done .
but there' s also something that i wanted to ask you .
um ...
tan !
your head !
is your friend all right , tanya ?
he does that .
anyway , what i wanted to mention was that we' ve got an opportunity to cut a demo ...
i' m sorry .
i don' t understand .
what kind of a demo ?
you know , like a sampler of our music ...
we' ve got to be clear that uni comes first that' s a career .
the band comes second that' s a hobby .
you' ve got to prioritise .
what the fuck is happening ?
tanya , listen carefully .
this is liquid ecstasy .
it produces a subtle feeling of well being .
this is some hardcore lsd i forgot i had in my kit .
i' m gonna rip open your skull and piss in the cavity where your brain should be !
tan !
don' t move !
my parents , you dickhead !
they' re clean .
so' s joe .
hello , boys and girls !
guess who !
oh , this shit is kind of robust .
that' s right .
we' re gonna dance all night , dance all day .
fire extinguisher !
someone call the fire brigade !
in here , freddy !
freddy , i trusted you .
you can' t have my soul !
die , fucker , die !
tanya ?
sweetie ?
are you ok ?
don' t come in here !
there' s been a bit of a problem .
tanya , what' s going on ?
we think the macadamia nuts are off .
tanya , darling , should we call a doctor ?
no , no doctors .
we just need to have a vomit and a lie down .
i' il just give you a call in the morning .
it' s ok , tan .
joe' s still out there .
excuse me .
do you have any idea what' s going on here , son ?
aw !
my melon' s got a pooey nappy .
20 years ago , a groupie would' ve washed my undergruns for free .
just to sniff ' em .
ah , the memories .
now i hang around here for hours every laundry day , praying that the blonde with the double serving of funbags will show up so i can watch her unmentionables flip flop around in the fuckin ' dryer .
what kind of a dad am i ?
she' s just rotting away back here .
you can sell her .
use the cash to make that demo .
you' ve got to be kidding .
no .
come on , take it .
not for this demo .
it' s not worth it .
come on , son .
let me give you somethin ' .
she' s just rotting away back here .
you can sell her .
use the cash to make your demo .
hang on , kevin , you can' t ...
i know , i know .
we' ve had some good times .
great times .
but , you know , they' re all up here .
nothin ' sadder than an old rocker that doesn' t know when to quit .
unless you' re the stones , of course .
you know what i mean ?
tan , hey .
it' s not freddy' s idea .
this is somethin ' i wanna do .
i didn' t make him do it .
we didn' t make him .
are you speaking for him now ?
i was just saying it wasn' t my idea ...
you don' t get it , do you ?
this is your time .
right now .
you' ve got to grab it .
you' ve gotta grab it ...
with both hands ...
and don' t let go ooh !
don' t let go oh !
oh , man .
i know someone who' d kill his own mother to get his hands on one of these .
good , luce .
let him know it' s for sale .
kev , you rock .
kate .
god , don' t do that .
how' s the baby ?
did you get an ultrasound ?
listen close , joe .
ultrasound , no .
abortion , yes .
yes , please , after what you' ve done .
how was i so blind ?
wait .
an abortion ?
jesus , don' t look at me like that .
i haven' t done it yet .
you' d be murdering our kid !
joe , you' re scaring me .
just stop following me and leave me alone .
fuck , that was hot !
so , let' s do that cuban thing now .
no , the speed metal track .
no , no , why don' t you do the ballad ?
no , the cuban thing shows we have range .
no , we' re doin ' the new one .
the killer opener ?
you have a fall ?
we' ve barely rehearsed it .
we' re doin ' it .
we' ve got time for one more ?
sure .
over the top , dudes !
rip that metal , man !
all right .
luce , count it in .
one , two , three , four !
yeah , so you split your mortgage between fixed and variable and you refinance when the interest drops .
more attitude , guys .
stronger .
scarlet , about that studio .
scarlet .
about that studio i wanted you to see .
i' ve organised it for later .
oh , sorry , i forgot to mention .

brunes , i want to talk to you about that .

i thought when i give the demo to shad , i' d do it on my own .
just you and me , right ?
no , just me .
you know , i wanna schmooze him a bit , one on one .
you understand that , right ?
yeah .
sure .
fuck !
i hope you don' t mind .
i let myself in .
what are you doin ' ?
you should give this a go .
red dye number two .
what' s wrong , sugar ?
it' s kate .
she' s killing the baby .
oh .
poor sweetie .
hug , hm ?
that' s what i said !
now you' re talking !
let' s celebrate .
they' re a 7 . 5 .
you love to piss me off .
it' s not my idea of a good time .
try one .
might stop you rushing ahead of the beat .
i' m on the beat .
you' re the one who lags .
if you can' t move , you can' t groove .
you idiot .
you say the most stupid things !
idiot ?
i do not !
compared to me ...
you show no respect for me at all !
you are so fucking wrong !
you' re just a rich , untalented bitch !
hey ...
look ...
ow !
ok ...
no .
look , tanya ...
no , man .
truce ?
i know i said i wouldn' t talk about us , but ...
we agreed .
just a meal .
i have to get this off my chest .
freddy ...
just relax , just let me finish .
the band' s got a real shot with this , and i want you to be a part of it .
i fucked up once .
i' m not gonna do it again .
freddy , i understand why you did what you did .
the band was your dream long before i was in the picture .
so ?
what happens when you do a world tour ?
well , you can come .
and what do we do with the baby ?
i' m having it .
that' s cool .
not a problem .
actually , it is a problem .
you' ve gotta see this thing with the band through .
and what about that night ?
it was ... a beautiful kiss .
you' re gonna meet lots of gorgeous women on the road with much less baggage than me .
you said nothin ' was goin ' on !
stop it !
nothing is going on !
stop it !
i should just go now .
goodbye , freddy .
kate , wait .
joe , wait !
melly !
dada !
melly !
what the fuck have you done , man ?
fuck !
fuck you !
fuck you , too !
fuckin ' freddy .
ungrateful little gutter mongrel .
i work my balls down to a stump for him and the band , and when the big moment comes , he express posts me a " fuck you " and steals all the glory for himself .
no loyalty , that' s his problem .
mm .
some indian would be great .
yeah !
some vindaloo would really hit the spot .
that' s my pole she' s twirlin ' on .
yeah .
yeah ?
i need you to get to the palace .
yeah ?
well , guess what ?
roadie hours are over for the day , so you can just fuck off !
stop dickin ' around .
it' s important .
i' il be there with the demo , but i' ve gotta find joe .
i need you to stop shad from leaving .
bruno' s onto it !
it' s ok , sugar .
melly !
hey .
there' s no need to be upset .
shad .
i mean , mr kern .
bruno .
in a pinch management ?
where' s freddy ?
he' s not far behind .
angie , i can' t do this .
of course you can .
oh , no .
joe ?
joe !
joe , what are you doin ' , man ?
where' s angie ?
what are you talkin ' about ?
angie !
joe , there' s no one here .
where ... where is she ?
just let me help you .
don' t tell anyone , ok ?
just don' t tell anyone !
shit !
freddy' s coming !
joe !
joe !
how' d it go with shad ?
you guys seen joe ?
i' m really worried about him , man .
he' s acting really weird .
joe ?
joe ?
you checked the house ?
you' re right , babe .
maybe he' s in the house .
babe ?
has the whole fucking world gone insane ?
what' s the problem , freddy ?
we broke up .
i don' t give a shit about that .
joe' s really flipped out .
i' m serious .
hello ?
freddy , someone here wants to talk to you .
listen , you little fuckwit ...
shad .
i' m sorry ...
there are rules , freddy .
and one of them is , don' t fuck with my time .
get your arse here before i finish my drink or be prepared for a very long famine !
fellas , can you give us a hand ?
it' s joe .
won' t answer his door .
joey !
oh , jesus !
joey !
not you too !
kev , give us some room .
joey !
call an ambulance .
what' s he taken ?
that .
sleeping tablets .
sedatives .
what do i do ?
we need an ambulance .
joey !
he' s got a pulse , mate .
he' s got a pulse .
i don' t know .
he' s taken them all .
i' m goin ' with him .
damn .
you saved his life , man .
can we have some music in here to drown that shit out ? !
take a hike , loser .
fuck !
you fuck !
i' m gonna kill you !
after that , everything just turned to shit .
joe , the band , my hopes for katie ...
the strange thing was , i still had this need to play .
music is a great thing to lose yourself in .
and , man , was i lost .
give it up for the rockin ' sounds of alternate current .
oh , no , this is ok .
the pay' s pretty good and ... killer crowds ...
i was sittin ' right there .
i hear joe' s doin ' better .
do you hear from the others much ?
no , it' s over .
kind of figure i should just lay low for a while , you know ?
hey , bon !
you' re the king !
it' s just an act , mate .
fuck off !
oh , yeah ?
fuck you , dickhead .
now , look .
the real reason i' m here , i' ve got some great news .
you got us a gig ?
who told you ?
are you serious ?
does dog shit love shoes ?
see ?
there you are .
right there .
when i saw it i thought it was a printing error .
no error .
you guys are booked to play at homebake !
this is our chance to really cook !
i don' t understand , man .
it was destiny .
that' s only her stage name , of course .
my friend destiny , her brother , he books all the bands for homebake .
it was under my nose all along !
she hooked me up just like that .
totally .
bruno makes a promise , bruno delivers .
here you are , joe .
lucy always said i' d find my perfect 10 sometime .
bingo .
prozac .
so , homebake , eh ?
yeah .
kev said they' re thinking of letting you out soon .
no .
i don' t think i' m ready for it .
you guys should still do it .
i won' t be pissed off , man , i promise .
hey , haven' t you always said guitarists were as common as flies around a sheep' s arse ?
been practising ?
kate brought it over .
i haven' t picked it up yet .
i' il get there .
how' s she going ?
good .
she said technically i never really cheated on her .
it was more of a mind fuck , really .
listen , i' m sorry i wasn' t there for you , man .
it' s ok .
it was down to me , nobody else .
things are a lot clearer now .
so , you thought of giving it another shot with kate ?
you' ve been having way too much of that prozac , dude .
hey .
i just thought of a guitarist .
i can' t , fellas .
shit , i' d love to , but ...
i haven' t been on stage in 15 years .
oh , come on .
you know all the songs .
no , i can' t .
luce .
man , my baby !
i bought it back off the guy i sold it to .
the bastard drove a hard bargain though .
c' mon , kev !
yeah , ok .
yeah !
yeah , kev !
i' m really gonna miss you .
like i told joe , my folks have heaps of room .
so , any time you guys wanna visit ...
yeah , yeah , that' d be great .
shame you' re gonna miss the gig .
blame it on the movers .
it' s funny , you know .
i really thought you two would make it .
it' s for the best .
joe' s the dad .
he won' t be left out , i promise .
no , i ...
i was talking about freddy .
but right now , he' s really putting everything into this gig .
yeah .
it' s everything he ever wanted .
he must be on a cloud .
... ready to rumble !
so you' re feelin ' pretty good ?
yeah , it' s what it' s all about , man !
we' re gonna remember this night for ever .
kate , it' s freddy .
this number has been disconnected .
please check the number and call again .
are we ready ?
yeah !
thou , thee and this ...
gonna be the hottest fucking gig ever , eh ?
who' s got the set list ?
lucy !
i ain' t got it .
freddy' s got it .
i don' t have it .
are you joking ?
you guys ...
i gave it to you five minutes ago .
don' t you ever stop arguing ?
joe !
think i' d miss my only chance to play at homebake ?
welcome home , son !
ok , ok , come on .
schmaltzy crap later .
let' s get this show on the road !
ah , this is it , eh ?
so where' s kate ?
she meeting us there ?
no .
she' s going to melbourne with the movers at three .
movers ?
she' s goin ' to her parents ' .
i thought you knew , man .
are we ready ?
all right !
let' s do it !
come on .
i' m not blind , freddy , look , i' ve been scared before .
fuck , i' ve been known to crap my pants , remember ?
don' t let your fear get in the way , mate .
the nerves' il disappear as soon as you start that first song .
guarantee it .
fuck it .
that' s the spirit .
a short cut .
ok , that everything , love ?
yeah .
talk to me , freddy .
this isn' t a short cut , is it ?
no !
didn' t think so .
oh , no .
no , not now , you piece of shit !
shit !
hang on a minute .
this is kate' s place .
stop !
in the name of love !
let' s go , mate !
there it is !
come on , mate , speed up !
oh , no .
will you pay sunni' s speeding fine ?
i don' t think so .
if sunni doesn' t friggin ' step on it , i' il shove sunni' s beaded seat cover up sunni' s arse !
no need for intimidation tactics .
you missed it !
go to the side !
oi !
kate !
katie !
look out !
the other side .
ok !
on my way .
what the bloody hell do you think you' re doin ' ?
aren' t you meant to be on stage ?
this is exactly where i should be .
you' il never forgive yourself , and you' il never forgive me .
that night , when everything changed , when you said my dream was only stupid if i gave it up ...
well , i' m not giving you up .
no way .
have you got room for me in melbourne ?
come on , you' il be late for your gig .
record crowds are expected at homebake .
coming up on triple j , we' il hear megaband sprimp live from the festival .
don' t worry .
when you start playing , they' il come running , you' il see .
how could she ?
yeah , well , she got what she wanted .
a nice juicy recording deal , a few added extras ...
but running off with a sound engineer !
i' m a rock star !
hey .
come on .
pour the pain into your music , man .
that' s it , that' s it .
five minutes , guys .
there they are .
hey !
freddy .
hey .
thanks , joe .
you ready to rock and roll ?
excuse me .
who' s in charge here ?
i am .
yeah .
that' s me , actually .
bumped ?
no !
of all the asinine , fucked up things !
sorry , guys .
we' re runnin ' late , and sprimp' s contract requires all other stages to be shut down when they' re playing .
nothin ' i can do .
you were so close .
there' s gotta be something we can do .
quick , come with me .
guys !
guys , wait up !
guys , pick it up .
we' re running behind .
four quad boxes stage right .
i need two a/ c thirties ...
excuse me .
i' m writing this article on roadies , the unsung heroes of australian rock .
could i talk to you after the show ?
this is it .
let' s rock and roll .
give the kids a go , fellas .
hello .
hello , sydney .
thank you for comin ' out in support of live music , and say no to pokies !
my name' s freddy , and ...
jim morrison lives , man !
fascists !
let ' em play !
you !
how the fuck did you get in here ?
freddy !
freddy !
freddy !
gimme a chance .
let me play one song .
you had your chance .
get ' em outta here .
you owe me !
wait right there .
what did you say to me ?
toby could still find out you' re bangin ' his chick .
i owe you nothing .
scarlet chewed him up and spat him out , so it doesn' t matter that i was banging his girl the whole time .
i could' ve had an orgy with his cousin , sister , grandparents and scarlet , and that moron still wouldn' t have known .
hey , guys .
dig your work .
toby .
mate ...
go , freddy !
go !
freddy !
freddy !
freddy !
consider yourself fired , wanker .
how you doin ' ?
this song' s a bit of a new one for us .
let ' em play .
if they' re any good , it' il give me an edge on the deal .
i hope you don' t mind , but , uh , it' s kind of a killer opener .
my big moment .
the moment i finally had to admit to myself that we just weren' t very good .
but sucking as much as we did that day and our suckage factor was enormous we still got to play in front of a whole country full of people .
it was the most fun it was humanly possible for any of us to ever have .
about seven months later , katie and i got married .
joe was best man .
joe junior made an appearance too .
bruno won a million bucks in some contest by finding a purple chocca .
lucky sod !
so he bought the palace right out from under that butt crumb thommo .
we took the pokies and smashed them all with polo mallets .
ladies and gentlemen , how we doin ' ?
me and joe manage bruno' s , and now the bands are back .
there' s been a bit of a scheduling mix up .
in the meantime , the house band' s gonna rip through a few for ya .
every few months , i give a band the wrong start time and slip us in ahead of them .
we might suck , but i never said we were idiots .
tanya finished uni and went into anger management .
lucy was the surprising one .
he got a degree in pharmacy and went into business .
what goes around , comes around , i guess .
joe kept up his medication and fell in love with a primary school teacher .
now , instead of one kid , he' s got 35 .
kevin .
well , he' s the same .
some things just don' t need to change .
that' s good , right ?
as for katie , she never got to experience the highs and lows of being a rock star' s wife .
but i think she' s ok with it .
and me , a rock star ?
not my destiny .
still , you don' t have to be a rock star to feel like one .
