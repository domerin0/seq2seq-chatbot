when i signed a 1 077 for you on the bulgari case ... ... you requisitioned 30 of my men for three months and made zero arrests .
i won' t do it again .
first , we cannot go at night .
the laser grid in the great hall' s impossible to beat .
nothing' s impossible .
this is impossible .
it' s in constant motion , programmed to improvise randomly ... ... meaning we can' t plan our way through .
all right .
so it' s a daytime play .
we' re still short three on the inside since isabel made you and yen and danny .
we could try a smuggler' s paradise .
it hasn' t worked since the ' 50s .
' 54 , actually .
what' s option two ?
baby jane , squeaky wheel , followed by a number two son .
it' s complicated , but it' s got a high success rate .
the only problem is
we can' t do it without a grease man on the inside , without yen .
we' il have to risk it .
we' il put him in disguise .
1 0 : 1 0 , i ieave the cafe , proceed west .
1 0 : 1 1 ?
i enter the second floor bathroom .
1 0 : 1 3 ?
approach the spanish steps from the south .
basher and i enter by the main entrance .
1 0 : 1 5 ?
i help yen into the ventilation duct .
1 0 : 1 8 ?
i move reuben to the egg room .
i pause in the great haii while  i go to the egg room .
1 0 : 21 ?
yen enters the mainframe room .
he cuts power to grid 1 4 a.
he radios me .
i signai linus .
i then go to the egg room .
1 0 : 22 ?
i drop my keys and move reuben to his mark .
i blind camera one .
i blind camera two .
i blind camera three .
camera four .
i make the switch .
right .
1 0 : 24 ?
i puii to the corner of the main entrance .
i meet danny at the steps .
we head north .
1 0 : 25 ?
turk and i make the drop .
aii right .
reaily good stuff , guys .
reaily good work .
aii right , we' ii pick it up here in an hour .
it' s a slam dunk .
great .
1 0 : 45 , we aii get arrested .
you bet .
how was toulour ?
he was predictable .
you hear from nagel ?
he' ii be here .
that' s a iot to presume from a guy iike nagel .
foilow it up .
this is isabel .
it' s johan .
i just set a 6 : 00 meeting for you with an andre ciment ... ... who says he had four paintings stolen from his house in lake como .
and when was this ?
sometime friday .
he' s missing two monets , a turner and a degas .
which degas was it ?
blue dancers .
supposedly , there' s surveillance video , but i haven' t been able to confirm that yet .
it is all about error correction .
three thousand separate , translucent , digitai slivers ... ... instead of the 1 000 i thought it would be .
thank god it doesn' t have to move .
re creating the iighting was a pain .
it' s a mixture of tungsten and reai iight .
but i think the color rendition is pretty damn accurate .
batteries are in the base .
two minutes maximum .
you' re good .
it' s good , roman .
you' re a genius .
i think i am .
you' d have never got past that grid .
that' s why you' re paying me double .
what ?
no , no , no .
you got my message .
who' s that sexy phone voice ?
early bond .
what message ?
the message i ieft with sexy phone voice nicole .
on your mobile .
got something going with gunther ?

so who' s got my money ?
who has got my bloody money ?
jesus .
sorry to hear about your mom .
she was an amazing ....
weil , i thought so , at ieast .
she hated you .
i should' ve picked up on that .
she hated aii thieves .
no wonder you fought .
excuse me ?
may i have my phone back ?
no .
that' s a nice puil , by the way .
thanks .
did you get that tingling sensation down your spine when you did it ?
or is that none of my business ?
you considered a career change ?
have you ?
i tried hotels .
i' m better at this .
went by the cafe for some tiramisu .
it wasn' t the same .
who' s the night fox ?
they did something to the eggs .
why accept his chailenge ?
because he' ii iose .
and how can you beat him ?
we can' t .
you' re not making any sense .
okay .
the bulgari job you puiled with frank when we were together ... ... i knew it was you .
why didn' t you say something ?
why didn' t you ... ... robert ?
i didn' t want it to end .
you assumed it would .
was i wrong ?
you shouldn' t be here .
i have a meeting .
someone stole a whole bunch of paintings in lake como .
interesting .
any ieads ?
the next time i see you ... ... i' m arresting you .
and ocean and anybody else i recognize .
fair enough .
ready ?
right .
yes , of course i do .
my blue dancers , my degas .
they took it , unfortunately , and i reaily would iike
do you have any enemies ?
anybody out there who would feei wronged by you ?
no .
i can' t see anyone .
but why ?
you think you think maybe the thief ... ... is trying to harm me personaily now ?
weil , i assumed he was after the paintings themselves .
i think it' s enough .
ready ?
good ?
i have something you might be interested in .
it' s a dvd with aii the hidden surveiilance cameras i have to my place .
it' s plenty .
i haven' t checked it out yet .
maybe the thieves have been careless enough to be photographed .
i doubt it , this ievei of thief , but i' ii take a iook .
yeah .
you never know .
okay .
weil , merci .
thank you , mademoiseile lahiri , for everything .

he' s just mean spirited .
how many espressos did you have ?
five .
yeah , come on .
i don' t know if she' s just confused ... ... or she' s reaily turned the corner and hates me now .
you think i handled this wrong ?
i was too forceful .
i was too american .
she' s different .
maybe you' re right , maybe she has moved on .
you know , i talked to a doctor about getting that tattoo removed .
but given its iocation , he advised against it .
that guy doing potsie is unbelievable .
i mean , what' s this guy' s problem ?
he' s stitched us up twice in two weeks , aii over his ego .
it' s the first decent evening we' ve had together in i don' t know how iong .
aii right , aii right , iet' s just stay on point here .
let' s go over the iist again .
who died and made you danny ?
no one .
i' m sorry .
my emotions are aii over the place .
i was forceful , trying to show good ieadership
for fuck' s sake .
let' s go .
you' re a good ieader .
thanks .
aii right , weil , iet' s go over the iist again .
swinging priest ?
not enough people .
crazy larry ?
not enough people .
soft shoulder ?
not enough people .
baker' s dozen ?
no woman and not enough people .
heii in a handbasket ?
we can' t train a cat that quickly .
and not enough people .
what about tess ?
what about her ?
weil , you know how she kind of iooks iike
so what ?
yeah , what' s your point ?
so we do a lookie ioo .
it' s a lookie ioo with a bundle of joy .
a lookie ioo with tess ... ... and a bundle of joy ?
you' ve gone right out of your tree , my son .
he' s mad .
it' s crazy .
it' s italian television crazy , and we' re stiii one short .
no , think about it .
she can get near the egg during daylight with half the system down .
i mean , that' s a trifecta .
he might be right .
make the cails .
linus caldweil , you are not foilowing the procedures ... ... danny talked about if terry benedict shows up .
something is wrong .
what is wrong ?
danny' s fine .
he' s with rusty .
during this part of the plan , they can' t communicate with us .
promise he isn' t hurt .
i promise he isn' t hurt .
you' re gonna miss the deadline .
danny would be thrilled if you met him in rome when the job' s finished .
he misses you like crazy .
plus , you studied art , so i know how much you love rome .
there' s no downside here .
wow , they' re bringing you along fast , aren' t they ?
yes .
danny would be more thrilled ... ... if you were on the 7 p . m . out of jfk , which means you have to leave right now .
i thought i' d requested a midsize .
danny here ?
he wanted to be .
did you have a nice flight ?
we weren' t sure if you were a window or aisle person .
how iong' s danny been in jail ?
just a couple of days , reaily .
which , you know , on the bright side , he' s completely safe from benedict .
he told me everything was fine .
he iied right to me .
what i think he meant by " fine " is we' re running iow on time and money ... ... and we' re deeper in debt than when we started .
i assume that you have a plan to get him out .
actuaily , she sounds iike her .
no , she needs a southern accent .
can you do a southern ?
what the heii is going on with you guys ?
not quite .
the accent is crucial .
it' s the first thing people notice .
this ridiculous car , what is it doing ?
okay , i' m sorry .
aii right , i' m just gonna ievei with you .
due to certain personnei iosses ... ... that we have sustained ... ... we' re various readjustments had to be made .
you' re gonna have to play a smaii role in this thing .
okay ?
so can you put these on ?
i' d iike you to put this hat on .
you' re gonna put on that , and you' re gonna stuff it with that .

the moment that she doesn' t talk to you in the restaurant , i knew .
your friends didn' t teii you ?

do you mind ?
that' s very unorthodox .
sorry , it won' t take iong .
what' s his name ?
his name' s robert .
aren' t you a iefty ?
i thought you were a iefty .
she is a iefty .
often pregnant women become ambidextrous .

this is great .
okay .
we' re on the move .
thank you .
you take care , now .

anyway , she just wanted me to iet you know everyone' s running a iittle iate ... ... and was wondering if you could make it at 1 : 30 instead .
i knew it .
shame on you .
i don' t think we' ve met .
bruce .
isabei lahiri .

do you reaily have a boyfriend ?
or were you just ?
was that just part of the whole thing with them ?
so how' d it go ?
you lahiri ?
i' m section chief moily starr .
i spoke to a very nice man at europoi this morning , commissioner greisman .
he wants you on the next flight to amsterdam .
there seems to be some irregularity with your paperwork .
that one .
let' s start with that one .
imagine yourself in a room ... ... that' s too short for you to stand up in and not wide enough for you to iie down in .
a room with no iight , no heat ... ... and stone wails scratched by the teeth and nails of desperate men ... ... men driven crazy by isolation .
you wiii have rats for company ... ... and a smaii window that iooks out on the world that has passed you by .
your parents wiii grow old and die , just iike your dreams .
your friends wiii forget your name , teii your stories as their own ... ... because what good is a story when the person who owns it has vanished ?
what do you want ?
testify against the others ... ... in the benedict case .
the italian charges wiii be dropped .
you and the others wiii be extradited to the u. s. this afternoon .
plead , and you walk with parole .
i can' t .
think about it , linus .
for a moment there , i was already forgetting your name .
wait .
just hang on a sec .
linus .
right .
thanks .
you okay ?
weil , i blew the meet with matsui .
matsui ?
let me guess .
he puiled a lost in translation on you .
that' s his idea of fun for first timers .
i mean how do i not see these things ?
don' t get down on yourself .
obvious .
we talked about this .
i hope danny and rusty appreciate the job you did in a tight jam .
i am proud of you .
thanks .
we both are .
you ?
you told dad ?
i had to , sweetheart .
you told dad ?
we were on vacation .
i' m sorry .

hey , remember the time your mom had to come to rome ....
i' m sorry .
every time with him .
it' s iike ....

hey , wait , wait !
what the heii is going on ?
your father' s alive , izzy .
your mom iied to you ...
... to keep you from him .
he' s alive .
what are you talking about ?
when they divorced , she told him if he contacted you , she' d go to the cops ... ... with everything to put him in jail .
how do you know that ?
and why should i believe you ?
i don' t believe you , okay ?
you know where he is ?
i know somebody who does .
there' s nothing back there but a forged 1 077 .
no .
reaily ?
no .
no .
that' d be horrible .
it' s hard , you know , for dinners .
weil , you must have very good contacts .
i hear it usuaily takes days to buy your way out .
tess , this is francois toulour .
madame ocean , at iast .
heilo .
he' s french .
shouldn' t you be somewhere else by now , iike ... ... outer mongolia , maybe ?
weil , before we get to that , we just wanted to ask you one question .
what is that ?
how' d you do it ?
oh , so that' s why you came .
you wanna know .
weil , i guess that' s normal .
but i got another deai for you .
you both recognize that i' m the best , and i' ii teii you my secret .
yeah .
that ....
make it if you get him to teii us ...
... and teii him that he is the best .
oh , okay .
i won' t teii him because you' re the best .
aii right .
thank you .
aii right .
we' ii teii you you' re the best after you teii us how you did it .
how can i refuse a dying man' s iast request ?
the egg arrived in rome at 6 : 45 p . m . the saturday before it went on display .
it was at the museum by 8 p . m .
wait a minute , hold on .
you stole it that evening ?
with the museum locked down ?
how' d you get in the building ?
how' d you get past the sensors ?
why didn' t my recon team see you ?
don' t touch my thing .
i didn' t touch your thing .
like it works .
you got greasy hands , you put them on the iens .
now i can' t see .
you can' t see anything .
i see you .
you iook iike a retard .
you iook iike a retard .
i' ii pay you a miilion doilars if you don' t speak for a month .
one month .
i wanna eat your whole head .
go ahead .
a miilion doilars .
no joke .
right .
with no equipment , no rope .
of course .
come on , don' t teii me you don' t know how to do that .
how did you get by the iaser field in the great hail ?
the iaser fields .
weil ....
okay .
toulour , you' re the best .
weil , thank you , danny .

now , if you can just get us our money ... ... we' ii be going .
the money ?
what money ?
the money that you agreed to pay benedict if we won .
we' re under a deadline .
no , no , no , you don' t understand .
you didn' t win .
you iost .
and not only did you iose ... ... your entire crew got pinched .
i gotta teii you something .
you don' t iook anything iike her .
eventuaily , the nose , but the ears
i mean , the way you walk and you dress ....
that means that you spoke to lemarc .
you spoke to lemarc ?
since i' m dead , i think my involvement in this should stay among the three of us .
of course .
absolutely .
it' s ironic that the solution to aii of our problems wiii be provided by toulour .
i' m sure i provoked him by agreeing with my american friend that you might be better .
i apologize sincerely for the trouble i' ve caused you .
there' s no need .
especiaily now .
remember , from the time you see toulour at his viila and the chailenge begins ... ... you must assume he wiii have you under surveiilance everywhere you go .
you' ii have to put on a very elaborate show .
the egg , the reai egg ... ... wiii be carried in a backpack on a train ieaving gare du nord ...
... at 9 : 30 a . m .
thank you .
you saved our iives , gaspar .
yeah .
and i' m stiii getting the better of you .
and i stole a replica ?
your paintings are in a high security warehouse in milan .
it' s 1 7 via andreotti , unit 222 .
security code is 2 3 1 1 6  6 4 6 .
thank you .
listen , aii games aside , that was that was very good .
that was good .
how' d you do that ?
weil , i told you one story tonight .
i think that' ii be enough .
