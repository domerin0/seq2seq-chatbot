t minus ten , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one , zero , ignition .
ten , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four ,
three , two , one , blast off !
guys , guys , please , please !
this is very risky stuff here , and i' m a highly trained professional astronaut .
now , uncle phil will launch another rocketjust as soon as he completes his fuel intake .
thanks , darlin ' .
now , you know , it takes six months just to reach mars .
then a year on the surface , six months back .
that' s , like , two years , you know ?
anyway , i guess what i' m trying to say here is that , um , you know , this being my last night on earth and everything , this could be a very precious memory for me .
nice try .
william , get that thing out of your nose .
don' t you talk back to mommy .
hey , woody .
yeah ?
our mars one crew won' t be heading back to earth ... till ten days after you guys land at our base camp with mars two . thank you , renee .
that' s a pretty long rendezvous , don' tyou think ?
what are you suggesting , sergei ?
i think maybe you should bring a baseball bat .
we will play american baseball on mars .
our two crews .
oh , please .
we could have ourselves a solar system series .
half you guys are foreigners .
we' d crush you .
no , no , no .
because we have equal crews .
we have three men , one woman , same handicap .
easy now .
that' s my wife you' re talking about .
terri just happens to be one hell of a shortstop .
fast pitch , no steals , batter calls his own strikes .
thousand bucks make it interesting ?
winner take all .
good .
you bring the balls .
the best thing about our mission on mars two , technically i outrank her .
so for the fi rst time in our marriage , she' s gonna have to do everything i say , right ?
yes , honey .
" yes , honey , sir , " with a little salute helps .
yes , honey , sir .
yeah .
i like it .
it' s good .
take that corn up there , all right ?
yes , sir .
i' m not sure how i feel about nasa allowing couples ... to go on this type of mission together .
nothin ' personal , terri .
i mean
it' s just that it' s a funny feeling for those ofus staying behind .
yes , but all the research shows that marriage will provide stability ... on these long duration trips .
then they haven' t studied some of the couples i' ve known .
luke .
come on , baby .
he' s not coming .
this isn' t right .
i mean , jim deserves this too .
all of his friends are here .
i know .
it' s my last night here .
hey !
it' s your last night with us too .
i know .
i' m sorry , baby .
mm hmm .
i love you , deb .
i love you too .
maybe you should spend some time with bobby .
yeah , where is he ?
up in his fort .
oh .
okay .
millions of miles away .
deep space .
so lonesome , so cold .
so lame , nick .
knock , knock .
bobby ?
your friends are out there playing .
what are you doing up here ?
who' s gonna read to me now at bed time ?
your mother will .
but ...
i like when you do it .
now we' re never gonna finish our book .
bobby .
listen , i' ve been thinking about that too , okay ?
and what i figured out was
how about if i bring along my own copy ?
then , every night , wherever i am , i' il read a little bit more ofit .
and you and mommy can read a little bit more of it wherever you are .
it' il be kind oflike we' re reading it together .
' cause i don' t know aboutyou , but i' m kind of anxious to find out how old ben gunn got marooned on that island .
you think that' s a good idea ?
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah ?
yeah ?
okay .
well , we were afraid you wouldn' t come .
i caught a whiff of your barbecue .
uh huh .
after that , yeah ?
i was , uh , helpless .
tsk .
all the way out in galveston ?
something like that .
mmm .
it' s his night , deb .
i didn' t want to spoil it .
spoil it " ?
he has been going crazy looking for you .
don' t ever do that to me again .
how ya doin ' ?
hey , i' m doin ' good .
here .
thanks , man .
a lot of people are gonna be glad to see you , you know that ?
yeah .
come on .
let' s go in .
you remember him ?
just let that go .
as soon as you admit that it was a no go situation .
it was a go situation .
three months , no data stream ,
you' re gonna land the ship ?
just ' cause you keep bringing it up doesn' t make you right .
just because you get loud doesn' t make jim , settle it .
no , don' t
just because you get loud doesn' t make jim , settle it .
no , don' t
settle it .
don' t look at me .
it was a go situation .
this is exactly what i' m talking about .
it' s hard to admit , i know that .
three commanders , one ship .
i don' t think that' s gonna work .
there' s not enough rocket fuel in the world to get those egos off the ground .
come on .
ah , we would' ve made a great crew .
maybe .
if this man was left seat .
yeah .
guys , come on .
i' m a pretty good stickjockey .
call me if you want a flight test .
what is a stickjockey ?
" i' m a pretty good stickjockey .
come on , mr. cover of time magazine .
the guy who landed the crippled block il shuttle .
yeah .
that' s the stickjockey .
the stickjockey did that .
yeah , mr. stickjockey .
okay , i made a little noise , but putting the first footprints on mars ?
that' s for guys who wrote their ph. d. thesis on how to colonize the place ... and for guys who read too much science fiction as a kid ... and still wear these little flash gordon rocket ships around their necks .
very mature .
you read every damn science fiction book i did , and you' rejust not man enough to wear jewellery , that' s all there is to that .
yeah .
you knowyou want flashy .
ain' t gettin ' him !
maggie would have loved to see you two clowns just one more time .
i' m gonna go and get a beer .
i don' t know , woodrow .
i think it' s about time you donated this baby to the museum .
internal combustion , boys .
accept no substitutes .
jim , listen .
if there' s , um
if there' s anything terri and i can do , you call us , all right ?
i' m okay .
really .
thanks .
all right .
luke .
yeah ?
i' il see you when i get to mars .
listen , don' t solve all the mysteries of the universe .
leave a little something for the next guys .
i' m not promising anything .
just bring some expensive beer .
all right .
will do .
godspeed .
thanks , buddy .
it should' ve been your mission , jim .
yours and maggie' s .
nobody ever wanted mars the way you two did , not even woody .
you two were 1 2 years training for this thing , hoping for this assignment .
well , that' s that' s all over now .
if maggie hadn' t gotten sick , if you hadn' t pulled yourself ...
out of the rotation to take care ofher , you  luke
no, jim .
wait a minute .
i wanna say this .
look , i wanted this assignment , all right ?
but not like this, jim .
i would give all of this up in a second ifit would bring maggie back to us .
i know that .
look , all the years of training and planning for this mission have been a privilege .
mars is yours now .
go get it .
i will .
you take care of yourself , jim .
you too , buddy .
okay .
i' il see you when i get back .
hey , luke .
have a great ride .
i always do .
luke , youreadme ?
here , renee .
luke , ljustgot ares 8 on line , and
well , we thinkyou' re gonna want tosee this for yourself .
okay , copy that .
now , is this the cinder cone ?
no , it' s too smooth .
it' s too angular .
volcanic upwelling , maybe .
no .
no fissure , no caldera .
no , it' s an upwelling for sure , but maybe not volcanic .
look at the color and how shiny it is .
that almost looks like
it looks like ice .
this far south ?
impossible .
you can' t have ice at this latitude .
i mean , not unless there' s , like , a
okay , how far away is that ?
sixteen kilometers , northeast .
take us 20 minutes to get there , chief .
we' re gonna send a packet to micker .
we' re going out there .
keep working .
okay .
careful .
watch your step .
is it possible to take picture ?
oh , picture .
here we go .
let' s have a picture .
say , " cheese .
this is a truly anomalous formation .
it' s unlikeanything everseenso far .
the structure appears to be crystalline , at least from the angle that' s displayed by ares 8 .
we' re trying not to go too nuts up here , but we think there' s a good chance ... that this could bean extrusion from some subsurface geothermal column of water .
and , of course , if that' s correct , then we may have found the key to permanent human colonization .
we thinkit wise to suspend judgement  let geology and hydrology ... know we need to scramble on this full court press .
so we' re gonnaheadout thereasap and takealookat this thing , tr yand getanidea ofits composition .
by the time you receive this , we should just about be on site .
anybody else hearing that ?
yeah .
whatis it ?
idon' t know .
itsounds like interference from therover .
can you fix it ?
hey , skip , i can fix anything .
love that modesty .
break out theradar .
let' s see what this thing' s made of .
oh , there' s onemore thing .
this is a very important , very special day fora good friend of ours back home .
we knowhe' s there right now .
he hates it when anybody makes any kind of a fuss abouthim , so i' m not gonna mention his name .
because the last thing i would want to do would be ... to embarrass someone likejim mcconnell !
was that loud ?
oh , well .
it' s done now .
it can' t be right .
it says there' s metal under there .
solidmetal .
no , that doesn' t make any sense .
you' re reading a vein ofore , renee .
no , it
it says it' s under the whole mountain .
all right .
move it closer , up the power , and we' re gonna try it again .
hey .
happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you okay , everybody .
i want you to take a look at jim .
is heallredwith one of those fake " oh , i' m a good sport " grins onhis face ?
that' s right .
now , everybody , take a look at ray .
does he have one of those ...
this wasn' t in my mission plan " looks on his face ?
uh huh .
i thought so .
there' s nothing you can do about it , ray .
we' re a hundred million miles away !
okay , let' s blow it out .
we' re all set here , chief .
let' s crank up thejuice , see what' s in this sucker .
what happened ?
oh , my god !
are you getting that , sergei ?
uh huh .
oh , my god !
renee !
oh .
oh , my god .
oh, jesus .
oh, jesus .
ahhh !
problem .. hatch door malfunction , backup power fail , manual override fail .
solution ?
replace optical relay .
piece of cake .
god , who dreams up these nightmares ?
don' t try to change the subject .
i' m not .
we' re talking about your sister' s wedding .
no , we' re talking about ... dancing lessons before my sister' s wedding .
do you mind ?
i' m in the middle of a catastrophic power failure here .
check .
not effective .
not effective ?
replace optical relay .
you' re distracting me .
we' re a married couple .
would it kill you to invite me ... out on the dance floor just once in a while ?
we danced at our wedding .
no , that' s not dancing .
that' s you shuffling your feet around while you grab my butt .
i' m talking about real dancing , you know ?
cha cha cha , rhumba , jitterbug .
darling , face it .
some couples dance , some go to mars .
that' s life .
test .
effective .
i' m serious .
as soon as we get back home , we' re starting lessons .
woody , if we never dance , people are gonna think there' s something wrong .
if they see me dance , they' il know there' s something wrong .
this is highly unprofessional .
this is highly unprofessional , sir .
you keep forgetting that " sir .
cockpit , this is control .
cockpit , this is control .
control , this is cockpit .
terri , it' s phil .
they want us all to report to micker asap .
who says to report to micker ?
the little men who live in my head .
that' s a negative .
we' re in the middle of a catastrophic power failure right now .
yeah , woody , it was ray beck .
he told me to round up the team , now .
the exact same moment we lost the data stream , they picked up this intense burst of energy from mars .
what do you mean " intense " ?
catastrophic .
what about the crew ?
the level ofenergy in the pulse ... didn' t seem survivable .
how about the remo ?
it went into mars ' orbit last week .
maybe it could give us some clue .
that' s just what we tried next .
right .
the , uh , resupply module checked out fine .
no instrument failures .
orbit holding steady .
but there was something else .
the remo' s computer contained an uplink message a very faint , highly distorted transmission from mars one base camp .
someone' s alive .
yes , yes , yes .
put up the message .
still concentrating on the audio , but we' ve got a long way to go .
show us whatever you' ve got .
show us .
i have to make this make this fast .
i may not get another chance to tomake another chance chance to thesite site .
there was a low sound that alow sound sound alow sound
something came out of the top of the mountain , and it hit us .
and ... it hit us it hit us
oh , my god !
they' re dead .
god .
nick man !
dead .
that' s it .
i don' t know .
luke must be in pretty bad shape ... if he hasn' t just blasted out of there in the earth return vehicle .
that thing' s designed so even one crew member can fly it back to earth .
even if luke was in great shape , he couldn' t get home .
an energy pulse of that magnitude would have fried the e. r. v' s computers .
other than the computers , how do we think the e. r. v. fared ?
so far , our modelling says it should be in pretty good shape .
which means it' s gonna be up to us to get new motherboards , drives and sof tware to mars as fast as we can .
right .
slow down , slow down , slow down .
it' s gonna take us weeks just to analyze this data .
right .
but in the meantime , we' ve gotta be working up a mission plan .
luke needs us now .
luke may already be dead .
and even if he' s not , it' s doubtful he is going to be able to transmit again .
so ... we wouldn' t know whether it' s safe to land ... until we were almost there .
what about slma ?
what about slma ?
the saturn imaging probe .
it' s gonna slingshot around mars on its way through the solar system .
it could be retasked to take pictures , read radiation levels of mars one base camp .
wait , wait , wait .
we are getting ahead ofourselves .
you' re forgetting the bigger problem .
the orbits are all wrong .
our first decent launch window is almost eight months from now .
yes , but we can go earlier and get there faster ... ifwe reconfigure the payload for extra fuel .
we' ve modelled that , ray .
i' ve modelled it .
on paper , yes .
but those stresses have never been tested in space .
the ship can take it .
oh , " ship can take it .
i wasn' t thinking of just the ship .
you' re right .
i know the protocols for a mars recovery mission better than anybody ... because i designed them .
and i' m telling you , these guys can do it .
he' s right , ray .
we' ve got a real shot here .
hmm .
well .
give me an updated mission plan by 0800 tomorrow .
you' il have it by 0600 .
let' s go to work .
chief , can i have a word ?
go ahead .
i no longer have the right crew .
what do you mean ?
bjornstrom can be up here on the next shuttle .
bjornstrom is a geologist .
he' s good , but not for this .
my people just lost eight months of training .
this is a different mission with a different objective .
i haven' t approved the mission yet .
yes , but whenyou do , it ought to be given its best chance for success .
i want mcconnell to fly right seat .
oh .
jim mcconnell is no longer on mission status .
yeah , because you washed him out .
he washed himselfout .
he only had to pass a few more psych evaluations , but ... he refused to take them .
his wife was dead .
he didn' t want to lay on the couch and share it with strangers .
that was his call , butlhad tomake one too !
it was tough as hell , but i' d do it again !
for christ' s sake , ray .
she wasted away in front of his eyes .
what was he supposed to do , suck it up ?
get with the program ?
what was his crime ?
that he showed a little emotion ?
i couldn' t trust him !
when maggie died , it knocked the hell out ofhim .
it knocked the hell out of all ofus .
butyou know and i know he' s still the best we' ve got .
he and maggie wrote the book on mars .
he' s had more hours in the sims than the rest ofus put together .
we can do this .
you give me mcconnell as copilot , and we will bring luke home .
it' s a promise .
hey .
what' s that ?
that is the exact genetic composition ... of my ideal woman .
hmm .
hey , hey , hey .
hey .
my baby .
now what is it ?
a frog ?
hey , skip .
hey .
take a look .
damn .
what do you make of that ?
duststorm .
southern hemisphere , coming from the east .
big fella too .
headed straight for mars one base camp .
yep .
could get a little hairy right about landing time .
yeah .
listen , we' re gonna have to be able to move fast .
maybe even advance our e. t. a.
these bad boys can cover a whole planet and last up to a year .
when does si ma do her flyby ?
tomorrow morning , 0600 .
that' s when we find out whether we' ve come all this way for nothing .
my money' s on luke .
all those interested in dance lessons , please report to the promenade deck .
and what , may i ask , brought this on ?
zero " g , " my friend .
my last chance to be graceful .
once we' re in mars ' gravity , it' s back to shuffl ing my feet and grabbing her butt .
incoming packet .
incoming packet .
it' s si ma .
enhanced look at base camp .
it looks deserted .
it' s still standing , though .
so' s the e. r. v. and look , there' s the green house .
well , we know luke survived for at least a few hours .
now , are there anysigns of recent activity ?
there .
scan northe astern quadrant of base camp .
what the hell are those ?
graves .
wait a minute .
there' s only three of them .
that means luke' s still gotta be alive .
phil , no , no .
itjust means there was no one lef t to bury him .
check the radiation levels .
check rad levels .
normal .
go to disaster site .
go to 41 by 9 .
what' s wrong ?
i don' t know .
magnetic interference ?
go infrared .
switch to infrared .
it' s gotta be a problem with si ma .
i don' t see how an earthquake six months ago could cause this kind ofdistortion .
that was no quake .
we are going to continue analysing this data ... and try to determine what the problem is with those images .
we agree that the evidence of the graves is , uh , inconclusive ... and that a groundsearch is advisable .
frankly , we are as stumped asyouguys , but we' ilkeep onit .
beware there are little sand storms kicking up ...
bureau babble . near mars one base .
but the big one youspotted is turningsouth .
itshouldn' tbe a factor .
we are all pretty excited around here , and we are sure you must be feeling the same .
enjoyyourmeal , and get a goodnight' s sleep .
say it .
we anticipate ...
say it . that tomorrow morning ...
say it . you will be go .
yes !
yes ! thank you . thank you .
hooray for baby jimmy !
yes , jim' s first spaceship was seriously underpowered .
maggie was always a little starstruck .
show us those beautiful teeth .
i am gonna get you guys for that !
when they met at the air force academy , it was love at firsr flight .
woody' s line .
later , during nasa training , things got a little tough .
yes , maggie always did keep jim on a short leash .
jim was always trying to explore a heavenly body .
where are the ygoing ?
ten thousand mile high club .
until
mission accomplished !
oh !
man , what a fun wedding !
i was so whacked .
uh , i' m going in .
t minus three ,
t minus two , t minus one , contact .
oh .
okay , we can stop there .
stop it there .
fast forward .
okay , you guys .
they are adding a wonderful chapter to their incredible story , and it' s a pretty historic one .
to the newly appointed co commanders of mars one , jim and maggie !
hear , hear !
i will drink to that .
thank you .
hold it .
it' s not over .
show ' em , show ' em .
yeah , we got a little addendum .
check this out , guys .
here we go .
it' s phil' s best work .
look , it' s mars .
you can pick up these postcards atyour local nasa souvenir shop .
when you two land up there , it will prove once and for all ...
that there really is no intelligent life on mars .
all right , touch .
you' re gonna eat those words .
i don' t think so .
give me the camera .
uh oh , here we go .
what if i' m right ?
what if she' s right ?
you okay ?
can' t it just be about science ?
we' il do the science , and do it really well , yeah . because that' s what we' ve trained for .
but what if there' s more ?
in all our myths , in every human culture , mars has always held a special attraction .
i mean , what if that means something ?
the universe is not chaos .
it' s connection .
life reaches out for life .
that' s what we were born for , isn' t it ?
to stand on a new world and look beyond it to the next one .
it' s who we are .
you know , she may have been right .
if that wasn' t a quake down there , then something else caused it ... or planned it .
you' re thinkin ' the same thing .
it' s never been out of my mind .
i think she knew something , woody .
she was the only one ofus who ever really believed ... there might be something down there .
yeah , well , we' re not leaving till we fi nd out .
deal ?
deal .

if you guys can save enough atmosphere ,
i' il disconnect the power in the main computer bay and jump start the systems .
i' d basically be doing a hard boot .
has that been tested ?
are you kidding ?

one kilometer .
that' s the best i can do .
prepare to abandon ship .
let' s go !
what are you looking for ?
earth .
hey .
when we get back home , we really will have to try this out in the sim .
how are we doing on the fuel , woody ?
i' m at 50 percent .
i don' t see the remo .
there it is .
forty five left , forty five down .
oh , jesus .
she' s not where i thought she' d be .
we' re gonna miss her .
what do you think ?
you can' t catch it .
not like this .
use the tether .
you' il have one , maybe two shots before she' s out of reach .
negative .
it' s toorisky .
if we miss it , we gotnothin ' .
i' il leave you the gun .
run a line out to the remo .
i got enough fuel left for that .
you' il be goin ' too fast .
i' il aim to overshoot .
i' il brake like hell and arc it in .
piece of cake .
i' il see you in a flash .
unhook me .
good to go .
okay , i' m on a path to overshoot .
i' m going to take the edge off .
i' m out of fuel .
coming in hot .
still long .
abandoning the unit .
i' il brake with suit jets .
jesus .
jesus .
suit jets gone .
i' m gonna make contact .
what velocity ?
impact' s gonna be a little rough .
at what velocity ?
thirty two .
i' m gonna use the gun to slowyou .
if you slow me , i' il fall short .
it' s too fast , woody .
no choice !
i' il be okay .
here we go !
gotcha .
woody !
woody !
woody !
woody !
woody !
woody !
no , no , no , no , no .
no , no , no .
terri .
what ?
take the gun .
take it .
phil , hang on .
go !
woody , what' syour status ?
well , uh , my suitjets are gone , and i' m still carrying a good deal of velocity .
soon as we get hooked up , i' il come getyou .
i' d have to say negative on that, jim .
negative on the transmission ?
no , i heard ya .
negative on the maneuver .
i am not retrievable .
woody , you' re not going that fast .
well , it all comes down to the amount of fuel , honey .
suit jets are designed for attitude control , not travel .
retrieval just won' t work .
well , it' s gotta work .
hey , listen .
i don' t like it any more than you do .
run the numbers, jim .
i am .
you hang tight , woody .
we' il get in the remo , drop her down and come scoopyou up .
sounds good, jim .
it' s gonna take half an hour ... to get the remo reoriented .
woody will be in the atmosphere by then !
then we' il just have to get her moving faster .
we don' t have time .
listen to jim , honey .
it' s a good plan .
no .
we' re gonna come getyou .
okay , get ready for brakes .
come on , now .
on my mark .
three , two , one .
you can do it !
you can do it !
come on !
come on !
mark .
yeah !
yeah !
everybody good ?
we' re on, jim .
way to go .
way to go .
good job .
all right .
there won' t be enough room for us inside .
soon as i get the hatch open , let' s start dumping the cargo .
copy that .
hang on , woody .
will do , jim .
hello , beautiful .
come on .
all right .
it' s open .
terri , no !
terri !
come back !
you' il never make it !
terri , what are you doing ?
i' il tell you what i' m not doing , woody .
i' m not gonna watch you die .
terri .
you' d do the same for me .
phil , get inside , dump the cargo and start the systems .
now !
no , i wouldn' t .
not if it was impossible .
i can do it !
no , you can' t !
you don' t have enough fuel to come get me and get us back .
listen to me , goddam it .
you have to stop , and you have to stop now .
he' s right , terri .
it' s no use .
okay , honey .
you gotta go back now .
the hell i do .
yeah .
what are you doing ?
i' m gonna jet in a little closer and try again .
terri , you spend any fuel getting closer , you won' t get back .
and if anyone tries to get you , they' il die too .
honey , please .
please go back .
go back and help the others to the surface .
i am not losing you !
i can' t let you do it .
i can' t let you die .
i' m sorry .
wait .
what are you doing ?
i love you , honey .
woody !
no !
no !
god , how i love you .
woody !
don' t !
woody !
woody !
woody !
don' t !
no !
no !
please , god , no !
woody .
woody .
come back , terri .
he' s gone .
no .
no !
terri .
we need you .
woody .
no .
no .
no .
no .
no .
please , terri .
come back .
ray , we' ve got some new data just coming in .
wejust it doesn' t make any sense .
we' re not sure how to read this .
data ?
yes .
telemetry reports the remo left its orbit and reached the martian surface .
crashed ?
no , sir .
under power .
what ?
sixty three minutes after mars recovery went off line .
sir , the graph shows a controlled descent , but that doesn' t make any sense .
they used the remo as a lander .
it' s it' s jim mcconnell .
it' s got to be .
nobody else could have pulled this off .
nobody else .
son of a bitch .
i' ve got access to the e. r. v. i' m going to go inside .
terri , is the oxygen generator okay ?
yeah .
it' s gonna take a while to get it back to 1 00 percent capacity , though .
okay , i' m entering the hab .
there' s still oxygen in here .
this is a little spooky .
i don' t like the dark ... at all .
need some lights .
need some lights .
okay .
where are we ?
here we go .
e. r. v. appears to be structurally intact .
yeah , but just as we thought , the computers are fried .
copy that .
i got busted fi lters here .
clogged intakes .
hell of a cleanup job , but so far , no major damage .
i' m in the greenhouse .
you gotta see this .
what is it, jim ?
it' s working .
i' ilbe damned .
luke .
you' re not here !
you are not here !
your wife is debra !
your son is bobby !
no !
you' re reading treasure lsland with him .
luke
it' s all right .
it' s me .
jim ?
yeah .
no , wait !
no , no , no , wait , wait !
he' s all right .
he' s all right .
phil .
terri .
jim jim , what are you what are you doing here ?
you' re not supposed to be you' re not supposed to be here .
how are you here ?
how are you here ?
this is a rescue mission .
woody wanted me right seat .
i can' t
i can' t believe
well , where is he ?
where' s woody ?
he didn' t make it .
god .
ohh .
ohh .
oh , no .
no .
oh , god .
oh , no .
well , it works , you know ?
i give them ...
co2 and light , and they give me oxygen and food .
it' s it' s actually not a bad arrangement .
it' s like a marriage , really , except not as many not as many fights .
i mean , some fights .
luke .
tell us what happened here .
we fi red the radar , and it it came and ... they all died .
they all they all died .
w what do you mean ?
what came ?
the force came out of the top of the mountain and and and ... everybody died , but i was spared .
why ?
why ?
ithad to be forareason .
and then all of a sudden , i knew the reason why .
it' s so someone would be left to figure out the secret .
you know , it' s
j j just come .
just come , come , come , come .
come , come .
is itjust me , or is he a few meal packs short of a picnic ?
long term exposure to low gravity can have an adverse impact on the brain .
or then , he could be suffering from some form of asphyxia .
or maybe his whole crew died , and he' s been marooned alone on mars for a year .
it' s a miracle he survived this long .
i' d better bring him up to speed .
great .
great .
great , great , great , great .
so , let me be sure i understand this .
your ship blew up with all its supplies , then you emptied all the cargo out of the remo , and it was totalled on landing .
you got no food , no water , no spare oxygen .
nothing other than what i' m looking at right here .
what k what kind of rescue mission is this, jim ?
that kind .
check it out .
new nav boards for the e. r. v.
i got four round trip tickets , baby , right in here .
thank you , god .
oh , thank god .
when i came to and dug myself out of the sand , my faceplate was cracked .
it was ...
ieaking , leaking badly .
i barely made it back to base .
it was weeks before i could work up the nerve to go back out there ... and look for and look for their bodies .
renee was the only one i could find , but itjust ... didn' t seem right somehow tojust dig one grave .
oh , god .
has it been blowin ' like this for a while ?
yeah .
we saw a big storm on our screens , butmickersaid it was turningsouth .
ifit holds course .
luke , this this whatever it was this this force
you said it came directly out of the top of the mountain ?
don' t you believe me ?
that' s okay , jim .
you don' t believe me , that' s okay .
but i' m not crazy , i know that much .
i' m not crazy .
what' d you mean by its " secret " ?
what secret ?
listen , hundreds of millions of years have gone by , okay ?
you' ve got erosion ,
iava flow , sand storms , meteor impacts .
hell , in that time the whole surface of the planet would have changed , so it' s no wonder we never saw it before .
i mean , we saw it , but not like they meant us to .
there was too much dirt on it .
saw what , luke ?
saw this .
jesus .
oh , my god .
luke , what are you trying to tell us ?
are you trying to tell us that' s a face ?
that' s the face .
it' s the face .
it' s real .
somebody put that thing there , andit' s notus .
jim
it' s not possible .
jesus .
look at that .
my god .
i know .
luke , what about that sound you heard before the explosion ?
oh , yeah , good, jim .
that' s the key .
that' s the key .
you hear that ?
yeah .
those pauses .
do you hear the pauses ?
mm hmm .
see , that' s what made me realize it' s a pattern .
it' s a repeating pattern .
mathematical ?
mm hmm .
that occurred to me too .
there are distinctblocks within eachpattern , and within each block , the tones come in groups of three .
it' s three three three , three three three .
always three three three .
it' s always thesame .
formonths , lstruggled toanalyze it , trying different constructs , and then i thought about dimensions .
x y z coordinate .
exactly .
three groups equals three dimensions .
so l i assigned different graphic values to each block , group and tone , and i came up with this .
hello .
oh , my god .
is that what i think it is ?
dna .
you see it ?
yeah .
it' s a model of dna .
so so somebody left that thing here .
okay .
somebody other than human .
but , uh , what is it ?
it' s a signature .
it' s a self portrait ofwhatever species created the face .
yeah , but that dna looks human .
no , it' s not .
it' s missing the last pair of chromosomes , see ?
it' s close .
it' s damn close .
close ?
the difference between man and ape is less than three percent genetic material .
but that three percent gives you einstein , mozart .
jack the ripper .
yeah , he' s right .
four pallets , oral , topical medications , splints , bandages , one complete med pack .
with eight tubes of antifungal cream .
well , at least we won' t rash to death .
luke .
how do you feel ?
lighter .
a lot lighter .
welcome back .
thanks , man .
the backup generator is salvageable .
so are two of the solar panels .
i' m pretty sure i can get the oxygen still back into production .
so we' re not in such bad shape , considering .
that' s good , terri .
good work .
jesus .
look at this .
phil' s idea of absolute essentials .
ofcourse .
hey , hey , hey !
hey !
my baby .
it' s not a signature .
what ?
the noise from the face .
it' s not a signature .
it' s a test .
it' s asking us for the right answer .
it wants us to put in the missing pair ofchromosomes .
why ?
to prove that we' re human .
we fi red radar into that thing , concentrated radio waves , and you' re saying
which it interpreted as the wrong answer .
it' s it could be like a security alarm .
when it gets an incorrect response , it defends itself .
so what happens when it gets the right answer ?
well ,
i don' t know that , phil .
but we gotta find out .
luke , what ifwe work this the otherway ?
we figure out which tones would be equivalent to the missing chromosomes , and then dub them into your recording of the signal .
is that possible ?
yeah .
yeah , l i think so .
good , good , good .
what about the radar gun ?
will it accept the input ... so we can transmit a completed signal back to the face ?
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa .
hold on , jim .
what if you' re wrong ?
whoever goes out there
i mean , what if you' re wrong ?
three people have already died over that thing .
four .
terri .
ifwe leave here without getting some answers , they all died in vain .
we don' t
we don' t have to go out there .
got a lot of static here .
something' s interfering .
yeah .
the antenna got knocked around pretty badly in the blast .
this is the best resolution i thinkwe' re gonna be able to get .
all right , guys .
i got the nav boards .
i' m sealing the air lock .
check the video feed .
video feed looks good .
how close do we have to get ?
i' m not sure .
maybe i' il stop it right over there by that rock .
do it .
good .
okay .
here we go .
look at that , jim .
it worked .
oh , god , it worked .
guys , i don' t know what the hell wejust did , but does that look to you like a hostile gesture ?
no .
more like an invitation .
oranothertest .
check for radiation .
normal .
seismic normal .
anemometer steady .
luke , does the rover still work ?
phil , do you read ?
yeah, jim .
your signal' s breaking up a little in the storm , but i read you .
we' re at the face .
we' re gonna need a few minutes here .
same deadline .
launch at 1 950 with or without us .
copy ?
copy that .
jim , you sure you want to do this ?
i' m not sure about anything any more .
but i didn' t come 1 00 million miles just to turn back in the last ten feet .
yeah .
please work .
this is gonna work .
yes .
yes .
computers are on line .
i am going to start loading software .
the surface ... seems firm and level .
roger that .
the texture' s smooth .
i' ve got good footing .
no obstructions .
let' s check our p. s. i.
guys , i gotta tell you
we' re losing visibility here really fast .
over .
it' s solid .
we' re trapped .
don' t move .
just keep this orientation .
guys ?
luke ?
terri ?
jim ?
phil , can you still hear me ?
is anyone there ?
over .
god .
that' s it .
there' s no handles .
we' re not gettin ' out ofhere unless they let us out .
jim , whatare you doing ?
what are you doing ?
stop it !
stop it !
you' re depressurizing !
seal your suit now !
there' s pressure in here .
above mars atmospheric .
it' s impossible .
we' re millions of miles from earth inside a giant white face .
what' s impossible ?
there' s 12 p. s. i. in here .
nitrogen and oxygen .
otherwise known as air .
hey , wait jim .
i haven' t checked for lethal trace gases , and i haven' t
what the hell .
look .
is that what i think it is ?
yeah .
it' s mars .
that' s where they went .
look .
one stayed behind .
earth .
before the continents separated .
my god .
that' s it .
hundreds of millions of years ago , there was a sudden explosion of life on earth .
the first multi celled plants and animals appeared .
no one has ever understood why or how it happened .
they seeded earth .
they seeded earth .
they' re us .
we' re them .
luke ?
terri ?
jim ?
anyone ?
e. r. v. to rover .
rover , this is e. r. v.
does anyone copy ?
does anyone copy ?
e. r. v. torover .
rover , this is e. r. v.
do you copy ?
phil ?
oh , thank god .
phil , we read you .
listen , this storm is getting really bad .
it' s going to totally sock us in in a few minutes .
you' ve got to get back .
phil ?
i repeat ..
you' ve got to getback to theship .
phil ?
we' re in a ship .
this ... is a ship .
and the ... countdown' s already started .
he' s right .
yeah .
yeah , let' s get the hell outta here .
jim ?
jim ?
come on , we gotta go .
i' m not comin ' with you .
what ?
what are you talking about ?
you' ve gotta get home .
that' s where i' m going .
don' tyou see ?
that' s that' s what all this is for .
terri , you were right .
this is an invitation .
this is aninvitation for us to follow them home .
i' m going .
it' s what i was born for .
like maggie said .
to stand on a new world and ... and look beyond it to the next one .
i know this is right ... for me .
you' re running out of time .
you gotta get back to the e. r. v. , and you gotta get off this planet .
thank you for saving my life , buddy .
it was a privilege .
i wish woody were here to see you .
he is here , terri .
we wouldn' t have made it without him .
he would have wanted you to have this .
e. r. v. to rover .
rover , this is e. r. v. do you copy ?
e. r. v. to rover .
rover , this is e. r. v. do you read me ?
phil , this is luke .
do you copy ?
he' s not reading me .
i can barely read you .
let' s get the hell out ofhere .
yeah .
i' ve lost the base camp beacon .
we' re driving blind .
i' m just going to keep going on a straight line , okay ?
that' s our only chance .
1949 , terri .
we' re notgonnamake it .
no .
i' ve worked with phil for four years , and i knowjim gave him a direct order , but he is not gonna leave without us .
please .
luke ?
terri ?
jim ?
e. r. v. to rover .
rover , this is e. r. v. do you read me ?
phil , do you read ?
this is luke .
we' re coming in .
phil ?
phil ?
phil isn' t here right now .
he , uh , left for earth five minutes ago !
please leave a message after the beep !
where is jim ?
he caught another ride .
dear god , look at that .
is that him ?
have a great ride , jim .
