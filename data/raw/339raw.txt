howdy there , mr. lee .
what' s this ?
filipino new year' s ?
no .
why you say that ?
' cause you' re cooking a feast .
i can smell it from the interstate .
what is that ?
barbecue ?
yeah .
but it not coming from here .
what is that noise ?
what is your take on this , jerry ?
the people will love it , mr. president .
our conflict is whether we ambush the 6 : 00 news or hold out for prime time .
screw the press .
this is a need to know situation .
we should make it top secret , and should move in with defcon four .
we can' t sit on this .
general casey , do you have an opinion ?
well , sir ... ... do we know they are hostile ?
what do you mean ?
they have the planet surrounded by thousands of warships !
do we know they' re warships ?
professor , what do we know about them ?
they' re very advanced technologically .
which suggests , rightfully so , that they' re peaceful .
an advanced civilization is , by definition , not barbaric .
mr. president ... ... this is a great day .
i and all my colleagues ... ... are extremely excited .
good .
extraterrestrial life .
you' re right , jerry .
the people are going to love it .
this is a momentous occasion .
mr. president
we' il go all media on this .
i' il wear my cerruti suit .
i' il need a good speech .
statesman like ... ... historical and yet ... ... warm , neighborly .
abraham lincoln meets leave it to beaver , kind of thing .
are they too old fashioned ?
no , i don' t think so .
this has got the colors but , no .
i don' t think so .
not vivid enough .
nancy had this in the library .
yes , indeed .
i don' t think so .
i thought perhaps the watered silk .
this week it' s on sale .
i hardly think i need worry about that .
my husband is the leader of the free world .
what do you think ?
why don' t you leave the roosevelt room the way the roosevelts wanted it .
because eleanor roosevelt was too fond of chintz .
that' s why .
mother , this isn' t your house .
lf you' re going to be a pest , i' il ignore you !
mrs. dale ?
i saw you fight sonny liston in ' 69 .
really ?
you were a nun back then ?
we' ve always been fight fans , haven' t we sisters ?
byron williams , telephone .
i must go .
you ladies have a nice time .
oh , louise .
sorry to call you at work , but ... ... the boys haven' t been home in two nights .
i don' t know what to do .
you' re doing the best you can .
they' re just at that age .
the casino manager' s giving me the evil eye .
i' ve gotta go .
i' il call you later , okay ?
are you still cool on me coming to washington ?
' course i am .
you take care , okay ?
bye .
must you drink in front of me ?
you' re an adult .
just cope .
it doesn' t help me that all we ever do is sit in bars .
this is work , baby , okay ?
i' m checking the decor , the lighting , the traffic flow .
lf i' d known you' d turn into a crook , i wouldn' t have married you .
i' m not a crook .
i' m ambitious .
there' s a difference .
lf you think you can make a nickel in this town ... ... without knowing how to dally around a few curves , well ... ... you know nothing of the gambling industry .
the galaxy' s going to be the best hotel in vegas .
the best !
i promise .
but don' t you realize what you' re doing ?
you' re destroying the earth !
all this greed !
this money system !
you' re destroying everything !
okay , barbara , okay .
keep your voice down .
i got friends here .
sugar !
hit me one more time .
stop flirting with the waitress .
god .
here .
go over to the roulette ... ... play our anniversary ... ... and stay off of black .
thanks .
make it quick , we go out live in ten minutes .
what ?
the actual president ?
cutting in ?
budget negotiations may be dead in the water after this week .
hair looks good .
i like the hair . ... quote , " factually challenged .
yeah , stone .
speak .
jason , hi , it' s me .
you wearing a bra ?
listen , this is big .
president dale is cutting into my show today .
that' s absurd .
why would he stoop to being on " today in fashion " ?
he' s interrupting everybody .
i don' t know , it' s some sort of an emergency announcement .
this doesn' t make sense .
he should talk to us .
white house is coming out live .
good evening , my fellow americans .
i apologize for interrupting your regular programs ... ... but i have a very important announcement to make .
my graduation from princeton ... ... the day that marsha said she would be my wife ... ... the birth of our daughter taffy .
thanks , dad .
and the news that i have heard today ranks right up there .
a powerful memory is in the making .
not just for me ... ... but for all mankind .
today ... ... an extraordinary discovery was made by the hubble telescope .
the data from the hubble was decoded ... ... then analyzed by the most powerful computers at mlt .
the images are undeniable .
we are entering the dawn of a new era .
frame enlargements provide an astonishing sight .
a fleet of vehicles , which can best be described as ... ... flying saucers .
come on !
come on !
papa needs a new pair of shoes !
hey , am i the only one shooting craps here ?
we hope we will have the chance to meet with them .
this is the perfect summation to the 20th century ....
martians .
this is great .
please , come to earth .
please .
we need you .
i got people coming in !
everybody wants to be part of this .
galaxy' s going to be world class .
and soon ... ... we will become one solar system .
what the hell' s he talking about ?
these flying saucers have come from mars ... ... and at their current course and speed ... ... will enter earth' s orbit in 16 hours .
i' ve been thinking about martians when there weren' t any .
it is profoundly moving to know there is intelligent life out there .
glad it' s somewhere .
our world will never feel quite the same again .
good night ... ... and god bless you all .
this ... ... is intense .
shut up , poppy .
shut up .
shut up !
jason stone .
it' s for you .
poppy , honey .
no , sweetie .
that' s right .
good girl .
i could be there at ... ... i don' t know , 11 : 00 .
they want me to interview the professor from the white house .
kessler ?
donald kessler ?
yeah , i think that was his name .
you know , the science guy .
this is nuts , this is ....
we should have got that guy .
your people are too slow .
right , poppy ?
finished !
one minute , 57 seconds .
didn' t i tell you under two minutes ?
you did !
you did !
hot damn .
want a doughnut ?
how old are they ?
fresh baked , monday .
richie , that' s six days ago !
give me a couple .
this martian thing is pretty awesome .
did one of you traitors see my muffy ?
your brother' s volunteering .
as soon as i get back to the base .
volunteer for what ?
martian detail .
cool .
lf any martians come around here , i' il kick their butts !
jump !
folks , we must make an unscheduled stop !
it' s mama .
why are you here ?
lf you ain' t home , why ain' t you in class ?
class was cancelled .
it was not !
come here !
why ?
i' m not going to hurt you .
let go of him .
okay .
now just come here .
come here .
think it' s smart to cut school ?
what are you doing ?
do you ?
no , it' s dumb .
you' il flunk !
go to jail !
get on the bus !
get on !
i' il be tripping on you .
get back there .
i don' t want to hear anymore .
i hate school .
i heard that !
hi , there .
want a date ?
how about it ?
a date ?
it sounds good .
the stress at work is ... ... unbelievable .
may i speak to you in private ?
no , i must watch the floor .
what do you want ?
i' m supporting a family back east .
i thought you were divorced .
i am , but i still have to take care of them .
things have been a little lean around here .
i was wondering if i could get a raise ?
out of the question .
i' m an asset to this hotel .
they like me around here .
you' re a nice guy .
but i can get leon spinks or buster douglas for the same money .
you better get moving .
you' re on in five minutes .
this show' s going to get a great rating .
it' s all yours .
ln certain circumstances the proposition that two and two equals five ... ... is entirely legitimate .
call me nathalie .
and you , do please call me donald .
i admire your show .
really ?
you like my work ?
yes .
very much .
why ....
thank you .
coming out of commercial .
in five ... four ... ... three ... two ....
welcome back .
we' re with professor donald kessler .
he' s the chairman of the american academy ... ... of astronautics .
professor ... ... isn' t it weird that we sent a space probe to mars ... ... and we didn' t even find anyone ?
well , not really ... ... nathalie .
we didn' t get into the canals .
the martian canals are canyons .
some are over 100 miles deep .
the martian civilization has clearly developed under the planet' s surface .
their science and technology must be absolutely mind boggling .
so ... ... what in your view , donald ... ... kessler ... ... chairman , are some of the things the martians can teach us , professor ?
quite a lot about mars , nathalie .
she' s flirting .
but seriously , this is tremendously exciting .
the knowledge , the new ideas : it' il change everything .
and we must be open to it .
maybe they can tell us about our universe .
how it started .
where it' s going .
perhaps even its purpose .
it' s tremendously exciting .
it' s the most important event since ... ... jesus walked in galilee
christ .
what' s wrong ?
go to camera two !
i can' t .
it' s busted .
go to one !
go to four !
he copped a feel .
now what ?
what' s that ?
so that' s a martian .
that' s a martian ?
oh , my god !
yikes !
i' m not having that thing in my house .
sweetie ... ... we may have to .
the people expect me to meet them .
they' re not eating off the van buren china .
look at that brain .
he must be real smart .
it' s gross !
don' t forget , nathalie ... ... that we will look equally gross to him .
he made the international sign of the doughnut .
from the limited information available , i' ve made three extrapolations .
our martian friend is a carbon based life form .
he breathes nitrogen .
the large cerebrum here , indicates ... ... telepathic potential .
you mean they can ... ... read our thoughts ?
potentially , yes .
what about their intentions ?
are they friendly people ?
logic dictates that given their high level of technical development ... ... they' re an advanced culture .
therefore , peaceful and enlightened .
the human race , on the other hand ... ... is an aggressively dangerous species .
now i suspect they have more to fear from us ... ... than we from them .
doctor .
thank you .
for many years , i' ve been refining a translating computer .
the results are not perfect , but this ... ... may answer some of your questions .
green skin ... ... 800 centuries ago .
their bodily fluids ... ... include the birth of half breeds .
how many centuries did he say ?
eight hundred , sir .
self determination of the cosmos .
for dark is the suede that ... ... mows ... ... like a harvest .
what the hell does that mean ?
hey , mitch .
good morning .
i' m sorry , you can' t come this way .
there' s a tour in progress .
hello , my name is barbara .
hello , barbara .
i am an alcoholic , but i haven' t had a drink in three months .
i' m feeling so optimistic because of the martians .
we' re not alone in the universe .
and it' s so perfect ... ... that it' s happening at the beginning of the new millennium .
our planet was suffering ... ... with the ozone and the rain forest and ... ... so many people unhappy in their lives .
and then ... ... the martians heard our global karmic cry for help .
people say they' re ugly ... ... but i think they' ve come to show us the way .
i think they' ve come to save us .
thank you .
bye bye .
you be careful .
don' t get yourself killed .
ain' t she cute ?
we' re real proud of you .
thanks , dad .
let me take this .
so long , retard .
don' t touch any of my stuff while i' m gone .
bye bye , grandma .
good bye , thomas .
it' s billy glenn , grandma .
i know , thomas .
bye bye , honey .
i must go .
take care of my boy .
he' il be all right .
i hope so .
army trains them good .
he' s gone for a while .
why can' t you be more like your brother ?
we got lucky with billy glenn .
you can' t expect the same luck twice .
richie , want to make yourself useful for a change ?
sure , dad .
take grandma back to the home .
i bet you never thought you' d live to see the martians come .
it' s pretty far out .
but think of all the crazy things you must have seen .
i bet people were pretty scared when they invented the train .
come on , kid , i' m not that old !
are you okay ?
i want to see slim .
i want to see ... ... slim ... ... and muffy ... ... and richie .
grandma , i' m richie .
i know , thomas .
richie was always the best one .
right now the president is talking to other world leaders .
they' re preparing a list of issues of common interest to discuss .
there is a unilateral , concerted , diplomatic effort being made .
jason .
thanks .
lf the martians land , can the press do interviews ?
well , that depends .
we must establish contact ... ... work out communication problems ... ... establish parameters .
then i guess we just see what happens .
here' s the president .
good morning .
it' s nice to see you all again .
i just have a few minutes for questions , so let' s get started .
mr. president !
do the martians have two sexes , like we do ?
from hollywood ... ... we bring you the " lawrence welk show " !
here he is , mr. music maker himself , lawrence welk .
this pussycat is the most beautiful pussycat ... ... in the whole world .
that' s my muffy .
didn' t you ever have a pussycat of your own ?
sure , grandma .
music !
there you go .
you going to be okay ?
lf you need anything , any doughnuts or anything , call me .
how do ?
looks like you ain' t got no wheels .
come on ... ... get in .
i' m going to do you a favor .
i owe you one .
i made a ton of money on your last fight in ' 73 .
the quaker in jamaica .
i' m glad somebody did .
yeah , i know , i know .
it' s rough on jocks .
you get to a certain age ... ... opportunities dry up .
so here' s the deal .
i got this chum , owes me a lot of money , needs a wake up call .
what i' d like you to do is ... ... use that patented left hook on him .
just in the ring , art .
just in the ring .
yeah , i' m hip , i' m hip , but ... ... i' il give you two grand .
when you' re done ... ... all you must do is mosey on by the office and get the cash .
why do you want to come at me that way ?
i' m trying to get back with my wife .
we had problems with this kind of shit .
but i' ve changed , man .
i found allah ... ... i don' t eat pork , i' m a better man .
i faced that demon and i don' t want him coming again .
you gave up pork !
they' re sending coordinates .
where are they landing ?
pahrump .
it' s in the nevada desert .
i can have my troops there at 0800 hours , sir .
we must not send these people the wrong message .
we need a welcome mat , not tanks !
what are you talking about ?
you can' t have martians running all over nevada !
you' re right .
thank you , sir .
this situation needs to be supervised .
absolutely , sir .
general casey ... ... can you handle it ?
i' d be proud .
good , but keep a lid on it .
key media , good cross section of guests .
we don' t want it to turn into a zoo out there .
they don' t know what they' re talking about !
liberals , intellectuals ... ... peacemongers , idiots !
would you please keep it down ?
people live here !
general casey .
yes , i get to greet the martian ambassador .
isn' t that great ?
oh , it' s a hell of an honor .
didn' t i always tell you if i stayed in place and never spoke up ... ... good things were bound to happen ?
i want the martians to be treated like foreign dignitaries .
i want your men alert and majestic ... ... with a snap in their step .
this must look good .
the world is watching .
yes , sir .
are you positive this thing will work ?
positively positive .
we don' t want any slip ups .
no , no , no , no .
not at all .
poppy .
all these people .
all of them here to see you .
there' s jason , poppy !
okay , let' s go .
the teeming masses have gathered from who knows how many states ... ... waiting and watching .
why have they come ?
curiosity ?
or is it something more ?
or simply to say , ' i was there ' ?
' i was there ...
' ... when first man ...
' ... met martian . '
jason stone ... ... gnn ... ... pahrump .
some room .
give them room .
it is an awesome sight .
the giant spacecraft glinting ... ... in the nevada sun like a ... ... giant ... ... hubcap .
something' s happening .
the doorway ... ... is opening .
a silver ramp ... ... is coming out ... ... like a giant tongue .
gee whiz .
martians !
funny little critters .
well ?
wait .
greetings .
i am the martian ambassador .
everything is fixed now .
you may speak .
greetings .
i am general casey ... ... commanding officer of the armed forces of the united states of america .
welcome .
he did that well .
we come in peace .
we come in peace .
we come in peace .
they came in peace .
we come in peace .
open fire !
what ?
die , you alien shithead !
i surrender !
no , it ain' t happening !
it didn' t happen !
holy mother of god !
did you see that ?
we should hit these assholes with everything we' ve got , sir .
sir , mr. president , i know this seems terrible ... ... but let' s not be too rash .
we should nuke them !
we must establish a line of communication first .
set up a town hall .
we' il get the public' s opinion .
what do you think ?
kick the crap out of them .
ladies and gentlemen ... ... it may be a cultural misunderstanding .
maybe to them , doves mean war .
we all saw how they reacted to that dove .
it frightened them .
he did say that ... ... " we come in peace .
the new computer' s ready .
okay , let' s do it .
i know we' re making the right decision .
ready to transmit .
this is the president of the united states .
i' m speaking in the hope ... ... that what happened earlier today in the nevada desert ... ... was a cultural misunderstanding .
there can be no doubt that we two peoples ... ... have a great deal to offer one another .
you must be as excited as we ... ... to find intelligent life in the solar system .
let me make it clear .
you have nothing ... ... to fear from us .
our customs may be strange to you ... ... but we mean no harm .
when the investors fly in ... ... i would like for them each to be ... ... met by a limo .
top of the line cars ... ... leather interiors ... ... corinthian , if they got it .
are you still spinning your wheels on that cockamamie hotel ?
hello !
the martians have attacked !
this was no misunderstanding .
i was there .
i saw it .
look , you' re worried about yesterday .
i' m worried about tomorrow .
the martians land on earth , they' il need a place to stay .
just like everyone else .
my god .
maybe we should all be destroyed .
the human race doesn' t deserve to live .
ethel ... ... that reminds me .
i' d like the limos to be stocked ... ... with every kind of alcohol known to man .
and top it off with a bottle of dom ... ... on ice .
what confounds me most of all is the lack of genitalia .
down here is the aorta .
up here we have the sphinx .
notice the highly developed nerve system here .
this explains , of course , the cerebral arteries .
and if we notice down here , behind the optic chiasm ... ... several glands ....
very curious .
he who believes in me , though he die , yet shall he live .
and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die .
billy glenn norris gave his life defending our country .
why did it have to be him ?
he' s a true american hero .
may god rest his soul .
ready !
aim .
fire !
aim !
fire !
hello ?
byron !
is everything all right ?
you still coming tomorrow ?
just try and stop me .
that plane arrives at 4 : 00 p . m .
are the kids there ?
yeah , hold on .
me first .
no , me .
hey , dad .
who' s that ?
neville ?
how are you ?
we' re going to the white house .
the white house ?
yeah , tomorrow .
give it back !
leave me alone .
it' s a school thing , like a tour .
so you' re still going to school once in a while ?
give me your ma again .
hold on .
mom .
you always get to the phone first .
so what ?
i' m first to the game .
why are you wasting this phone time ?
i' il see you tomorrow .
but there' s something i want to say to you .
just ' cause i feel like saying it .
what' s that ?
i love you .
i love you too , byron .
now stop wasting money !
i' il see you tomorrow !
they' re responding .
a message from the martians .
really ?
they' ve issued a formal apology .
this is great !
i told you this would happen .
the martian ambassador feels terrible and wants to speak to congress .
that' s good , isn' t it ?
you bet .
it' s a victory for our administration .
ladies and gentlemen .
this is a proud day for all americans .
this is a hell of a photo op , jerry .
are you sure i shouldn' t be there ?
the secret service don' t want the executive branch ... ... and the legislative branch in the same room .
the martian ambassador is going to say a few words .
come on down , mr. ambassador !
mr. ambassador , please !
please !
this doesn' t make sense !
it' s not logical !
it' s not
guess it wasn' t the dove .
fire !
they blew up congress !
why' d they do that ?
maybe they don' t like the human being .
hello , gentlemen .
nice of you to come on ... ... such short notice .
general decker ... ... it seems i owe you an apology .
we all make mistakes , mr. president .
not anymore .
we' re going to take charge of this thing !
excellent .
i have prepared the order .
what' s this ?
your executive order for full use of our nuclear deterrent .
are you crazy ?
i' m not starting a war !
we' re already at war , sir !
we have to nuke them !
we must nuke them now !
general decker , if you do not shut up ... ... i' il relieve you of your command .
we must strike now , sir !
annihilate !
kill !
kill !
shut up !
shut up !
shut up !
now ... ... i want the people to know ... ... that they still have two out of three branches of government ... ... working for them , and that ain' t bad .
i want the people to know that the schools will still be open , okay ?
and i want the people to know ... ... that the garbage will still be carried out .
and i want a cop ... ... on every corner .
which , incidentally ... ... we would already have ... ... if they had listened to me in the last election .
jerry ... ... how soon can we go on the air ?
my fellow americans .
it is with a heavy heart ... ... that i speak to you this afternoon .
as you know ... ... earlier today the martian ambassador and his confederates ... ... attacked and killed ... ... many of your representatives on capitol hill .
i will be conferring with other world leaders as time goes on .
and rest assured that , working together ... ... we will soon come out ... ... at a very real outcome .
thank you .
nathalie , is that you ?
yes .
how' re you ?
not terribly good , i' m afraid .
may i ask you a question ?
of course you can .
were you flirting with me on the show ?
because ... ... if you were ... ... i just want you to know ... ... that i liked it .
you did ?
really ?
because , you know , i' ve watched you on tv quite a bit and ... ... well , i' ve ... ... had something of a schoolboycrush on you for ... ... oh , gosh ... ... ages .
hi , there .
are you interested in the white house ?
i work there .
i' m the press secretary .
jerry ross .
have you ever heard of me ?
you wouldn' t believe the pressure of my job .
it' s nice to see a new face .
are you doing anything ?
' cause if you want , i ... ... could give you a personalized tour .
would you like that ?
hey , mitch , it' s me .
can you let me in ?
hello , mr. ross .
sure .
we' re a little nervous here , after what happened .
exactly .
many great men and women have passed through here .
now we' re passing through here .
feels good , don' t it ?
you' re very graceful .
i like that .
come here .
we call this the kennedy room .
pretty nifty , huh ?
so ... ... how about a drink ?
getting more comfortable .
outstanding .
how' s my lady doing ?
oh , missy , you' re hot .
could we get that gum out of your mouth ?
my finger !
hello !
hello , operator ?
this is an emergency !
help !
don' t shoot !
don' t worry , darling .
get down !
thank you , mitch .
it' s my job .
what' s happening ?
they appear to be in a highly agitated state .
and i , i don' t know .
i honestly don' t know .
i don' t know what' s going on anymore .
this is frustrating .
i' m not feeling myself .
lf only i could hold you in my arms !
oh , donald !
i' m scared !
excuse me .
you said you wanted to know as soon as possible .
what is it ?
it' s no2 .
highly concentrated .
nitrogen .
so ... ... that' s how it could breathe in our atmosphere .
what' s that noise ?
but , theodore , i simply do not feel that lincoln ....
it' s a full scale invasion .
we must get you to safety .
not this way ?
i' m sorry , there' s a tour going through .
the blue room is often considered the most beautiful in the white house .
it is often used by the president to receive guests .
it is furnished to represent the period of james monroe .
what' s that ?
that ... ... is a portrait of james monroe .
we lost taffy !
keep moving , we must get you to the back stairs !
the nancy reagan chandelier !
what are you gawking at ?
get that president out of here !
i personally guarantee ... ... that you will get a complete return on your investment ... ... within five months .
mr. land , excuse me .
just a second , sheik rakula .
now ... ... even in a time of so called intergalactic emergency ... ... the people ... ... still want to roll them bones !
i believe
just five more minutes .
what i' d like for you to do is to ... ... view our new , state of the art show room .
it is out of sight !
gentlemen .
there is no way ... ... that we can lose .
it' s not unusual to be loved by anyone
it' s not unusual to have fun with anyone
but when i see you hanging about with anyone
it' s not unusual to see me cry
i want to die
i' ve called you all day .
the flight' s been canceled .
byron , there' s martians everywhere !
hello ?
i can' t hear you !
i must get to washington .
do you know anyone who can fly a plane ?
your husband , art .
he' s dead .
i told him this would happen .
i loaded the plane with supplies .
i want to go to the tahoe caves .
it' s remote , the martians won' t find it .
where' s the plane ?
private airfield .
other side of the freeway .
will it fly to washington ?
i want to go to tahoe .
you find it happens
all the time
love will never do
what you want it to
why can' t this crazy love
be mine
jesus christ !
girls , get out !
there' s a martian right behind me !
you' re tom jones !
it ain' t unusual .
