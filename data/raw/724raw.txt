and my eyes are fiery .
and it' s like it' s electric .
and i say to her , " mom ....

thanks for ietting me finish .
what can i say ?
you' re a funny guy .
oh , yeah .
my friend rusty .
i' m worried about him . he owns this hotel in los angeles ... ... iosing a iot of money , and he' s got no llfe . he' s a nice , bright kid , but he' s beating his brains out .
do you think i could send something through you , like , a message to him ?
i read your palm , not his .
somebody who could do that could do very well .
anything on my health ?
my hips are bothering me .
please .
this ?
you couldn' t see this ?
i tried knocking , he won' t open .
i' il handle it .
i know him .
jesus christ , are you people retarded ?
it says , " do not disturb " !
it' s me .
hey .
come on in .
jeez , topher , you didn' t have to go all frankie muniz on me .
i' m sorry .
rust , look , i know this is your joint .
i just ....
there' s this girl .
i love her , man .
i love her , but she is driving me crazy !
i can' t sleep .
i can' t work .
i quit the show .
i totally phoned in that dennis quaid movie .
i mean , it' s like ....
hello ?
god , it' s almost like this kabbalah crap doesn' t even work !
rusty , call for you .
dude , don' t ieave .
yeah ?
i have a message for robert charles ryan ... ... soon to be ex owner of the standard hotel .
you got him .
last time we spoke , you hung up on me .
you used some nasty words .
i got sensitive ears .
i admit i was a little emotional that evening .
think about that night a iot , don' t you ?
i thought i' d be dead before i heard the sound that killed me .
i' ve been asked to show restraint .
otherwise , you would' ve gone out ... ... to your favorite car of all the 17 you own , and as soon as you turned on the ignition ....
you got two weeks .
now , you told me that your wife said that he called it ocean' s 1 1 .
now , who decided that ?
i' m a private contractor .
it was a collaboration .
that moniker is insulting .
it was one job we did together .
i don' t know where this proprietary stance comes from .
it seems possessive .
one could make the argument that because it was danny' s idea hang on a minute .
we all had our own areas of expertise .
i mean , without us , it don' t ieave your head , mate .
it just hurts , you know , because ... ... it seemed we all agreed to call it " the benedict job .
that' s what we called it when we were doing it .
if you wanted to call it something else
when you have a problem , who do you go to ?
rusty .
rusty .
thanks .
let' s get back on the topic .
based on what we stole , plus interest ...
... how much does everybody owe ? $1 7 . 34 million .
assuming benedict gives us prime plus one , which i doubt .
figure 1 9 to be safe .
okay , 1 9 each .
anybody got that ?
what , you think the stock market' s some great mystery ... ... beyond the realm of human understanding ?
didn' t you see the signs ?
i saw the signs . how much is everybody short ? how much you short ?
fourteen .
fourteen .
all but 5 million ?
yeah .
you gonna start with me ?
you don' t know what it' s like to create something from scratch .
well , with interest , i' m short 7 .
eight .
i spent about a million , mostly on talent development .
that makes it 7 for me .
boy , the interest just kills you .
i' m llght 9 .
what' s the interest ?
about 6 .
then i owe 6 . how ?
what ?
i' ve been staying at my parents ' .
i owe 25 .
hotels , man .
saul ?
i haven' t spent it all , but i will .
i' m out , fellas .
as ranking old timer , i gotta say , i just can' t do it .
at my age , i think i earned the right to be selfish .
i wanna thank you all for the wonderfui opportunity .
you' re all aces in my book .
but i want the iast check i write to bounce .
saul , you having a iaugh ?
saul .
i can handle saul' s share .
you don' t have to .
who would i talk to if you were all dead ?
that' s a good point .
all right , i owe 1 0 .
amazing ?
yeah , but it' s a nice place .
so that comes to ... ?
ninety seven , give or take . he didn' t find us on his own .
someone helped him .
another thief .
nobody we know would violate rule number one .
what we do know is we need a job .
we need a high paying job .
we' re too hot to work anywhere in this country .
so we go abroad . how about we go ?
we' re on the 5 : 00 .
good .
where are we going ?
amsterdam .
amsterdam it is .
clock' s running .
let' s go .

what' s wrong with you ?
nothing .
what ?
can i ?
can i ?
what ?
just for a second , can i talk to you ?
what' s wrong ?
i just i don' t know .
this might not be the perfect time or whatever to talk about it .
okay .
i' ve been thinking .
i' ve been doing my homework .
and i' d really like ... ... to play a more centrai role this time around .
right .
i feel like i' ve

i was wondering if i could come to the meeting and help you guys negotiate .
okay .
it' s just a sit down with matsui .
he' s got his own ianguage , this guy .
i watched you and danny really closely iast time around .
i iearned a ton .
linus , in my professionai opinion , you' re not ready .

rusty ... ?
do you know where rusty is ?
no .
so have you met matsui ?
seriously , what do you think of me ... ... you know , in terms of just ieadership potential ?
the fact that we' re unemployable shouldn' t enter your mind .
otherwise , you' re wasting time .
don' t mention benedict unless he does first .
and if he does , tell him everything .
right .
stay on point .
and don' t forget the other thing i told you .
what ?
about llstening .
relax .
remember , if we don' t get this job , we' re dead .
rusty , i tried calling you all yesterday .
so finally , she slams her vodka tonic down on the tray and says : " hey , maybe that' s why i' ve been feellng so warm recently .

so , what are we waiting for ?
van der woude .
that' s the bad news . he never leaves . he' s agoraphobic . he' s never been out of his house ?
not in 10 years since he moved in .
does he believe in fresh air ? he opens his window .
what does that mean ?
best time of arrival .
means he opens his window .
every night at 1 : 30 he takes an ambien , puts on beethoven' s third .

sure .
look into your heart .
i cry every time .
what ?
we have no llne of sight .
our only possibility , the window .
we' re three inches too high .
there' s no clear shot , even with basher .
in the physicai universe we occupy , it cannot be done .
what about the guy from the bulgari job ?
nagel .
spoke with him .
anything ?
lot of ideas , none of them any good . he' s pushing this new holographic technology .
really interesting stuff , though . he can reproduce anything 3 d. how about 97 million ?
we' re forcing it .
yeah , we' re forcing it .
you know what we haven' t thought of ?
what ?
we turn ourselves in .
what could benedict do to us then ?
there you go .
call the cops , tell them we did the bellagio job .
they put us away for 20 years .
that' d teach him .
i think tess would stick around .
you look great in jumpsuits . hey ...
... how' s the hotel business ?
sucks . how' s east haven ?
sucks .
i don' t know .
can' t turn my brain off , you know .
it' s me .
we go into some place , and all i can do is see the angles .
it' s what i do .
it' s what i' ve always done .
i love it .
i don' t know .
some sort of weird irony , you know ?
tess watching me scratch and itch . hey , llsten .
you know , the world' s gone nuts and you' re ....
what' d you wanna do ?
it' s not attached to the adjacent bulldings .

schumann did it in ' 64 in venice and ' 73 in istanbul . he only had a crew of six .
we can' t tilt a house .
did it with the leaning tower of pizza .
exactly , thank you .
it took 300 men over two years to do it .
there' s 30 pylons .
we cut them , insert the jacks and crank away .
it' s really our best plan , considering it' s our only plan .
crank for how long ?
like i said , it' s our only plan .
what ?
oh , oh , okay , hold on .
try that .
number five .
i' m a go .
master thieves who practice the iong con live separate lives as civilians .
they have iegitimate jobs and families ... ... which make them extremely difficult to catch .
the greatest thief of all time was , without question ... ... gaspar lemarc , who either dled in portugai in 1 988 ... ... or in hong kong in 1 996 , or he' s still alive .
we may never know for certain , because lemarc ... ... was never captured or photographed ... ... despite being active for over 50 years .
the thief we know only as the night fox .
so named for the small onyx figurines he ieaves behind to taunt us ... ... the night fox must be considered our number one priority . his string of high profile crimes are an embarrassment to our branch ... ... to our entire profession .
we need more than traditionai resources to pursue thieves like the night fox .
we need to train ourselves to think the way they think , to see what they see .
and we should not allow ourselves to be distracted
i' m sorry .
someone just robbed the van der woude house .
what ?
hi , isabel .
well , we could really use your help on this one .
i hope the scene hasn' t been contaminated .
when can i speak to mr. van der woude ?
probably tomorrow . he' s heavily sedated .
we can' t figure out how they disabled the alarm .
shorted it out somehow ?
no , that would have triggered the system and damaged the circuits .
well , then .
then i don' t know how they got in .
they had the code .
someone other than the owner must have known it .
impossible .
van der woude programmed the iast nine steps of the system . he set it and never left the house again . closed ioop .
redundant servers .
titanium encasement .
it' s not bad , actually .
yeah .
thanks .
do we know each other ?
i think i saw you yesterday .
oh , yeah ?
yeah , you were being chased by the pollce .
chasing me ?
no .
i don' t think so .
i' m quite sure it was you .
doesn' t say much for the police .
no , i love rome .
i love it .
but there' s an opening at work the ievei above me , and it' s
i was thinking i was gonna try out for it .
it' s in amsterdam .
my mother has family there , so it' d be it' d be good .
he lifted the whole house ?
the whole house .
the entire house ?
the entire house .
it' s called a schumann special ... ... named after this guy , a brilliant guy , max schumann .
then he did it in istanbul in 1973 .
what is it ?
it' s where the crossbow bolt hit .
the crossbow bolt ?
they fired from that rooftop through this open window .
with a crossbow bolt from that roof through that window ?
that' s a very difficult shot .
no , it is an impossible shot ... ... until they raised the building .
check the pylons .
they' il be elevated .
you know the name max schumann ?
no .
well , they do .
who ?
the americans .

what ?
oh , god .

congratulations .
you are the second person to crack the van der woude safe tonight .
in arriving second , mr. ocean , you havejoined a long line ... ... of people who' ve worked hard and risked a great deal only to get somewhere second .
you don' t know these people by name , of course , because they enter oblivion .
you know this word , " oblivion " ?
it means to be totally forgotten by everyone forever .
and it' s where you would be now if it weren' t for the bellagio heist . how does this guy know who we are ?
in a way , i' m responsible for you coming to amsterdam in the first place .
i hired matsui , and matsui hired you .
that' s the guy who dimed us to benedict .
all of them , including ocean .
yes .
i find that hard to believe .
and you are ?
you can call me the night fox .
the night fox .
okay , mr. night fox .
what will this information cost me ?
don' t worry .
nothing .
nothing ?
who do you think you' re deallng with ?
nothing costs nothing .
and this information is definitely worth something .
let' s just say our interests are temporarily aligned . how so ?
well , the information is free , but it comes with certain conditions .
such as ?
restraint on your part .
restraint ?
that' s asking a iot .
what else ?
two weeks to buy themselves out of trouble .
two weeks ?
i can live with that , even if they can' t .
just out of curiosity , what will you make them pay ?
for ietting them live ?
everything they stole , plus interest .
a iot of interest .
but didn' t your insurance cover what was stolen ?
of course .
so you' re asking them to double your money ?
well , do you really think that' s fair ?
fair ?
i certainly hope not .
so , what about the information ?
okay .

what is he doing ?
get him out of there .
god .
hello , frank .
i can' t understand what we did to this guy .

of course , you' ve been seeing plenty of me , haven' t you ?
i like this one .
i call it " thief ia mode .
schumann special , huh ?
i guess that' s what i get for opening my mouth .
so , what about the night fox ?
did he ieave you a message ?
what about the figurine ?
you still have it ?
i suppose it' s a compliment in a way .
i guess he' s threatened by you , though i can' t imagine why .
you have no idea what you' re up against .
the french police think he' s better than lemarc .
well , he is french .
let me give you some advice .
find out how you offended him .
apologize .
beg for mercy .
got to go .
any message for frank ? he' s been hanging around the station .
on what charge ?
well , we found a print of a size 14 hi tec magnum boot at the crime scene .
and ?
bought with a fraudulent credit card .
from that point on , well , there' s only one , maybe two great nail salons in amsterdam .
and you lied to us .
yeah , and to me .
well , frank knew .
frank knew you were in touch ?
i wasn' t in touch .
i was more like keeping tabs .
she' s a cop !
detective , actually .
where' d she learn all that schumann crap ?
dad .
what , he was a cop ?
thief .
oh , god .
was he good ?
oh , yeah .
great .
pissed off ex girlfriend whose thief father ... ... taught her every trick in the book .
well , she just made danny and yen .
in the next 48 hours , your pictures will be in every pollce station .
nobody looks at them .
nobody but cops .
detectives .
you' d think she' d have sympathy for us ...
... if her old man was a thief .
is that sympathy or empathy ?
no , her old man got popped a day before her 9th birthday . dled in jall .
so i wouldn' t count on much sympathy .
or empathy .
she' s gonna have the hotel under survelllance .
great .
we' il just eat room service , watch movies and wait for benedict to kill us .
who' s on the $1 00 bill ?
adams .
john travolta . he said every problem ... ... is an opportunity in disguise . he couldn' t say that with a . 45 in his mouth .
no , you' re missing the sliver lining here .
now , she gave us a name , didn' t she ?
the night fox .
one phone call , we' re gonna find out everything there is to know about this guy .
the name is m. diaz .
d i a z.
it' s a black duffei bag .
the team' s in rotterdam .
the bag' s in brussels . he' s the modern man : disconnected , frightened ... ... paranoid , but with good reason .
it' s too sad to be funny .
unusable .
i think i can get 20 minutes out of it .
great .
i got it .
the team' s in barcelona .
the bag' s in madrid .
this is a moral issue we' re dealing with here .
and we don' t have a grease man anymore , because he' s in a bag somewhere .
we got a bag man .
such an ape .
an animal with no feelings .
i have feelings .
no , you don' t .
i feel bad for the guy . he' s in a piece of iuggage , but he' s got water .
what did you want them to do ?
get off the bus .
and pick up the bag with our friend in it . how many pro soccer teams are fielding 50 year old men ?
rusty' s not 50 years old .
yeah , dude , we know rusty' s not 50 .
you think i' m 50 years old ?
let me ask you something .
no , wait , let me ask you something . how old do you think i am ?
forty eight .
you think i' m 48 years old ?
fifty two ?
maybe he should' ve asked me .
nobody should ever ask you anything .
that guy doesn' t have a hard enough llfe right now ?
you gotta
you' re gonna defend him ?
they put yen in a handbag .
can i ask you something ?
ever notice ?
if you' re gonna ask a question ... ... give me time to respond , unless it' s rhetorical ... ... in which case the answer is obvious : yes .
okay , can i ask ?
yes .
you ever notice that tess looks exactly ?
don' t ever ask that .
seriously .
not to anyone .
especially not to her .
wait .
why not ?
look .
it' s not in my nature to be mysterious ... ... but i can' t talk about it , and i can' t talk about why .
can i ask you ?
do i look 50 to you ?
yeah .
really ?
well , i mean , only from the neck up .
saul ?
what' s the matter ?
nothing .
you wanna go out ?
it' s nice .
no .
you wanna watch something ?
the game' s on .
no .
you hungry ?
i' il heat something up .
no .
saul , ever since you got back , you' ve been acting strange .
what did danny want ?
nothing .
nothing ? how could he want nothing ?
all right , the night fox has a name .
franois toulour .
baron franois toulour .
father was a french industrialist , mother was italian nobility .
he never met her , but he inherited her title .
the bad news is he' s rich , he' s bored and he' s talented .
the really bad news is he was trained by lemarc .
this is not good .
with the lemarc ?
gaspar lemarc ?
that' s the one .
well , we' re doomed .
we' re not doomed .
he' s one guy , and he' s french .
yeah .
before we get too impressed by his background ...
... let' s hear what he' s done .
he started in the ' 90s .
bank of geneva , the danish treasury , the bank of italy , amc amro ... ... the brussels diamond exchange , antwerp diamond exchange .
wait , wait .
all those in the 1990s ?
i' m only up to ' 96 .
seriously ?
in ' 97 , he went through an art phase .
he hit the tate in london , the louvre in paris , twice , and the prado .
wait .
no , no , hang on .
the prado museum in ' 97 ?
that was moretti .
everybody knows that  he is moretti .
it' s one of his aliases .
okay , i' il skip to my favorite .
in 2002 , he stole the king of morocco' s 200 foot yacht .
vanished into thin air .
crew surfaced days later in a life raft .
couldn' t remember a thing .
how do you hide a 200 foot yacht ?
if the king knows , he' s not telling .
he got it back a month later .
he now plays tennis with toulour every weekend .
we' re in some serious trouble here .
copy that .
so , what do we do ?
we respond .
respond ?
how ?
in kind .
mr. ocean .
you broke rule number one , and that has consequences .
oh , you must be talking about the paintings .
don' t worry .
you' il be dead in five days , and i' il get my paintings back .
unless you have an accident first .
i don' t think so , daniel .
perhaps i should explain to you why i' m tormenting you .
i' d like that .
last month i was in portugal to see my mentor .
lemarc .
indeed .
a very loud and annoying american businessman was there the same day .
he worked for a big insurance company .
he' s the one who suggested benedict to you as a potential mark .
you know the man ?
what about him ?
he said it was the most beautifuljob he' d ever seen .
he went on and on about this job , and then he said ... ... it showed you were the greatest thief in the world .
but the worst part is that lemarc never corrected him .
i told lemarc that you can' t be better than me .
and he answered that it was impossible to know for sure .
so i thought about that for , like , three weeks in a row , day and night .
and then suddenly , i realized that he was actually right .
it is impossible to compare one theft to the other .
so i guess the only way to know who' s the best of us for sure ... ... is to go after the same object .
do the same job .
don' t you think that would be fun ?
you' re being awfully cavalier with a lot of people' s lives so you can play out a game .
you' re gonna regret it .
come on , mr. ocean . how are you gonna possibly get $97 million by next wednesday ?
especially if every safe you crack between now and then is already empty ?
whereas if you accept my challenge and win ... ... i promise i' il pay your debt to benedict ... ... and lemarc will hold my money in escrow as a guarantee .
what are we steallng ?
the famous faberg coronation egg .
was that your idea or lemarc' s ?
i think he would agree ... ... that it' s the most appropriate thing for us to compete over .
where is it located ?
the egg left paris this morning on its way to rome .
it travels with heavy security and usually with one or more replicas .
sometimes they even show the replicas without anybody knowing .
when the egg goes on display monday morning ... ... you' il have 48 hours to steal it before your deadline' s up .
when the deadline passes and you don' t have the egg ... ... lemarc will know who' s the best .
rusty' s phone .
who is this ?
nicole .
who' s this ?
nagel .
where' s rusty ?
he said if you called , to say he was at gunther' s .
gunther' s ?
what' s that about ?
did he say something ?
do you have a message ?
yes , i do .
tell him this thing is gonna cost him double what i told him .
and tell him i had to go three times as thin on the iayers .
and tell him if he wants it tomorrow , it should cost him more than double .
and tell him this thing is beautiful .
would fool the bloody romanovs themselves .
and tell him i' m being a nice guy .
and tell him he dresses like a gigolo .
is that it ?
yeah .
no .
tell him having a sexy female assistant ... ... is such a terrible clich .
can i get a coffee or something ?
thanks .
just a cappuccino or espresso .
well ....
you call me on saturday and ask me to come into my office ... ... and sign a 1077 ... ... and you can' t even tell me what they are after ?
i can come to your house .
i' m leaving for naples in two hours .
we' il talk about this on wednesday .
it' il be gone by wednesday .
what ?
what ?
what will be gone ?
something worth signing a 1077 for .
ryan and his friends did the bellagio casino heist in 2001 .
i am telling you , this is serious  if that' s true ...
... then we should call the american fbl  no , no , no .
maurizio , llsten to me .
agent lahiri ... ... a 1077 is not a small thing .
unless you can tell me what they are after , there is no point in discussing it .
hey
because lemarc stole it in 1 980 when 23 others falled .
because the night fox is trying to prove he' s better than ryan and his friends .
this is ridiculous .
you say the egg will be stolen .
then you say lemarc already stole it 24 years ago .
which one is it ?
both .
what ?
lemarc' s wife made him put the egg back .
when i signed a 1077 for you on the bulgari case ... ... you requisitioned 30 of my men for three months and made zero arrests .
i won' t do it again .
first , we cannot go at night .
the laser grid in the great hall' s impossible to beat .
nothing' s impossible .
this is impossible .
it' s in constant motion , programmed to improvise randomly ... ... meaning we can' t plan our way through .
all right .
so it' s a daytime play .
we' re still short three on the inside since isabel made you and yen and danny .
we could try a smuggler' s paradise .
it hasn' t worked since the ' 50s .
' 54 , actually .
what' s option two ?
baby jane , squeaky wheel , followed by a number two son .
it' s complicated , but it' s got a high success rate .
the only problem is
we can' t do it without a grease man on the inside , without yen .
we' il have to risk it .
we' il put him in disguise .
1 0 : 1 0 , i ieave the caf , proceed west .
1 0 : 1 1 ?
i enter the second floor bathroom .
1 0 : 1 3 ?
approach the spanish steps from the south .
basher and i enter by the main entrance .
1 0 : 1 5 ?
i help yen into the ventilation duct .
1 0 : 1 8 ?
i move reuben to the egg room .
i pause in the great hall while  i go to the egg room .
1 0 : 21 ?
yen enters the mainframe room . he cuts power to grid 1 4 a. he radios me .
i signai linus .
i then go to the egg room .
1 0 : 22 ?
i drop my keys and move reuben to his mark .
i blind camera one .
i blind camera two .
i blind camera three .
camera four .
i make the switch .
right .
1 0 : 24 ?
i pull to the corner of the main entrance .
i meet danny at the steps .
we head north .
1 0 : 25 ?
turk and i make the drop .
all right .
really good stuff , guys .
really good work .
all right , we' il pick it up here in an hour .
it' s a slam dunk .
great .
1 0 : 45 , we all get arrested .
you bet . how was toulour ? he was predictable .
you hear from nagel ? he' il be here .
that' s a lot to presume from a guy like nagel .
follow it up .
this is isabel .
it' s johan .
ijust set a 6 : 00 meeting for you with an andre ciment ... ... who says he had four paintings stolen from his house in lake como .
and when was this ?
sometime friday .
he' s missing two monets , a turner and a degas .
which degas was it ?
blue dancers .
supposedly , there' s surveillance video , but i haven' t been able to confirm that yet .
it is all about error correction .
three thousand separate , translucent , digitai slivers ... ... instead of the 1 000 i thought it would be .
thank god it doesn' t have to move .
re creating the llghting was a pain .
it' s a mixture of tungsten and reai llght .
but i think the color rendition is pretty damn accurate .
batteries are in the base .
two minutes maximum .
you' re good .
it' s good , roman .
you' re a genius .
i think i am .
you' d have never got past that grid .
that' s why you' re paying me double .
what ?
no , no , no .
you got my message .
who' s that sexy phone voice ?
early bond .
what message ?
the message i left with sexy phone voice nicole .
on your mobile .
got something going with gunther ?
am i in ?
okay , when did you ieave the message ?
two days ago .
she had your phone .
she has your ?
yeah .
that means that she' s ?
yeah .
well , you better  yeah .
that' s great .
i mean ....
so ?
so who' s got my money ?
who has got my bloody money ?
jesus .
sorry to hear about your mom .
she was an amazing ....
well , i thought so , at ieast .
she hated you .
i should' ve picked up on that .
she hated all thieves .
no wonder you fought .
excuse me ?
may i have my phone back ?
no .
that' s a nice pull , by the way .
thanks .
did you get that tingling sensation down your spine when you did it ?
or is that none of my business ?
you considered a career change ? have you ?
i tried hotels .
i' m better at this .
went by the caf for some tiramisu .
it wasn' t the same .
who' s the night fox ?
they did something to the eggs .
why accept his challenge ?
because he' il iose .
and how can you beat him ?
we can' t .
you' re not making any sense .
okay .
the bulgari job you pulled with frank when we were together ... ... i knew it was you .
why didn' t you say something ?
why didn' t you ... ... robert ?
i didn' t want it to end .
you assumed it would .
was i wrong ?
you shouldn' t be here .
i have a meeting .
someone stole a whole bunch of paintings in lake como .
interesting .
any leads ?
the next time i see you ... ... i' m arresting you .
and ocean and anybody else i recognize .
fair enough .
ready ?
right .
yes , of course i do .
my blue dancers , my degas .
they took it , unfortunately , and i really would like
do you have any enemies ?
anybody out there who would feel wronged by you ?
no .
i can' t see anyone .
but why ?
you think you think maybe the thief ... ... is trying to harm me personally now ?
well , i assumed he was after the paintings themselves .
i think it' s enough .
ready ?
good ?
i have something you might be interested in .
it' s a dvd with all the hidden surveillance cameras i have to my place .
it' s plenty .
i haven' t checked it out yet .
maybe the thieves have been careless enough to be photographed .
i doubt it , this level of thief , but i' il take a look .
yeah .
you never know .
okay .
well , merci .
thank you , mademoiselle lahiri , for everything .
thank you .
goodbye .
goodbye .
mademoiselle lahiri .
did you get the faxed copy of the 1077 ?
a dozen twelve uniformed officers .
metal detectors , extra cameras .
so i' il e mail you the photographs .

i' il just give you the names .
okay .
livingston dell , male , caucasian , 5' 6 " , 1 50 pounds .
virgil malloy , male , caucasian , 5 ' 1 0 " , 1 60 pounds .

hey .

what ?
sleeping .
why are you dressed ?
it' s 5 : 30 , day of .
we gotta go .
let' s go .
it' s 11 : 30 .
the night before .
but ....
oh , he' s mean . he' s just mean spirited . how many espressos did you have ?
five .
yeah , come on .
i don' t know if she' s just confused ... ... or she' s really turned the corner and hates me now .
you think i handled this wrong ?
i was too forceful .
i was too american .
she' s different .
maybe you' re right , maybe she has moved on .
you know , i talked to a doctor about getting that tattoo removed .
but given its iocation , he advised against it .
that guy doing potsie is unbellevable .
i mean , what' s this guy' s problem ? he' s stitched us up twice in two weeks , all over his ego .
it' s the first decent evening we' ve had together in i don' t know how long .
all right , all right , iet' s just stay on point here .
let' s go over the list again .
who died and made you danny ?
no one .
i' m sorry .
my emotions are all over the place .
i was forceful , trying to show good leadership
for fuck' s sake .
let' s go .
you' re a good leader .
thanks .
all right , well , iet' s go over the llst again .
swinging priest ?
not enough people .
crazy larry ?
not enough people .
soft shoulder ?
not enough people .
baker' s dozen ?
no woman and not enough people . hell in a handbasket ?
we can' t train a cat that quickly .
and not enough people .
what about tess ?
what about her ?
well , you know how she kind of looks like
so what ?
yeah , what' s your point ?
so we do a lookie loo .
it' s a lookie loo with a bundle of joy .
a lookie ioo with tess ... ... and a bundle of joy ?
you' ve gone right out of your tree , my son . he' s mad .
it' s crazy .
it' s itallan television crazy , and we' re still one short .
no , think about it .
she can get near the egg during dayilght with half the system down .
i mean , that' s a trifecta .
he might be right .
make the calls .
linus caldwell , you are not following the procedures ... ... danny talked about if terry benedict shows up .
something is wrong .
what is wrong ?
danny' s fine .
he' s with rusty .
during this part of the plan , they can' t communicate with us .
promise he isn' t hurt .
i promise he isn' t hurt .
you' re gonna miss the deadilne .
danny would be thrilled if you met him in rome when thejob' s finished .
he misses you like crazy .
plus , you studled art , so i know how much you love rome .
there' s no downside here .
wow , they' re bringing you along fast , aren' t they ?
yes .
danny would be more thrilled ... ... if you were on the 7 p . m . out of jfk , which means you have to leave right now .
i thought i' d requested a midsize .
danny here ? he wanted to be .
did you have a nice flight ?
we weren' t sure if you were a window or aisle person . how long' s danny been in jall ?
just a couple of days , really .
which , you know , on the bright side , he' s completely safe from benedict . he told me everything was fine . he lied right to me .
what i think he meant by " fine " is we' re running low on time and money ... ... and we' re deeper in debt than when we started .
i assume that you have a plan to get him out .
actually , she sounds like her .
no , she needs a southern accent .
can you do a southern ?
what the hell is going on with you guys ?
not quite .
the accent is crucial .
it' s the first thing people notice .
this ridiculous car , what is it doing ?
okay , i' m sorry .
all right , i' m just gonna level with you .
due to certain personnei losses ... ... that we have sustained ... ... we' re various readjustments had to be made .
you' re gonna have to play a small role in this thing .
okay ?
so can you put these on ?
i' d like you to put this hat on .
you' re gonna put on that , and you' re gonna stuff it with that .
and we' il turn around , just give you a little moment .
small role .
who am i supposed to be ?
well ....
oh , really ?
well , absolutely .
i can have we can make the suite available .
no , no , no trouble at all .
i mean , we would love we are honored that she would think of us again .
okay .
okay .
thank you .
bye .
how is this going to get danny out ?
we needed someone famous .
why didn' t you get someone famous ?
just think four weddings and a funeral .
she wasn' t in four weddings and a funeral .
i. " " i wasn' t in four weddings and a funeral .
just protect your fake baby .
i' m hyperventilating .
welcome back , signora roberts .
thank you .
she' s very tired .
take it .
take it .
okay .
oh , let' s hide .
let' s hide .
julia ?
my name is teresa .
i thought i saw a friend of mine , someone that i know .
no , absolutely not .
you can' t turn off the pressure sensors .
no .
well , she can' t touch it .
she' s a movie star .
she' s not the pope , for chrissake .
you' re from smyrna , georgia .
you were born in 1967 .
you like croquet and knitting .
your middle name is fiona .
you' ve got 10 dogs , seven horses .
your favorite color is peach .
she doesn' t have more horses than dogs .
i can' t do this .
i can' t .
tess , we' re out of time .
" julia , " please .
julia .
no , we understand you' re feeling insecure .
that is totally natural .
you' re playing an actress .
they' re insecure .
no , i' m not insecure .
i' m freaking out .
yes .
that' s right .
brilliant !
you' re playing a role .
no , you' re playing a role .
i' m apparently playing a real person .
yeah , so ?
it' s just wrong .
you mean , like , morally ?
no .
well , yes .
probably it' s not the point .
the point is you want me to speak ... ... for someone who' s out there somewhere .
it' s too personal .
more personal than your husband doing 25 to life ? he won' t do 25 to life .
benedict will have him killed immediately .
don' t .
i' m sorry , that was stupid .
we' re gonna be in and out in 1 0 minutes .
we have to .
that' s our time frame .
you don' t even have to talk .
give them a big smile , wave at the cameras .
that' s all she ever does .
but if you do say something ... ... don' t forget your accent .
drop your g' s , and longer vowels .
room service .
it' s gonna be fine .
you' ve gotta remember something .
you are an image to these people .
you' re like an object .
nobody actually knows you .
the last thing this is gonna be is personal .

she' s practically jogging .
in thalland ... ... mothers routinely give birth in rice paddies and then go right back to work .
amazing women over there .
rice paddy ?
she will not have it in a rice paddy .
she' il be at her own paddy .
and she will be very comfortable because she will be strong ... ... from this walk and this exercise .
was she worth it ?
was tess ?
the moment that she doesn' t talk to you in the restaurant , i knew .
your friends didn' t tell you ?
no .
that' s when you figured it out , huh ?
yeah .
but the movie was still enjoyable for me .

isabei lahiri , i' m with the museum .
it is so great to meet you .
we' re very iate .
i' m sorry , this won' t take iong .
i don' t wanna be an annoying fan , but my boyfriend is such a huge fan .
i can' t iet you ieave unless you sign something for him .
do you mind ?
that' s very unorthodox .
sorry , it won' t take iong .
what' s his name ? his name' s robert .
aren' t you a lefty ?
i thought you were a lefty .
she is a lefty .
often pregnant women become ambidextrous .
you are a big fan .
she doesn' t necessarily have to sign lefty .
oh , thanks so much .
this is great .
okay .
we' re on the move .
thank you .
you take care , now .
and one more thing .
i just got off the phone ... ... with someone called marcy who put you on a plane from taos , new mexico to l. a ... ... where you have a 1 : 00 meeting about a film , clowns can' t sleep .
anyway , she just wanted me to iet you know everyone' s running a llttle iate ... ... and was wondering if you could make it at 1 : 30 instead .
i knew it .
shame on you .
i don' t think we' ve met .
bruce .
isabei lahiri .
nice to meet you .
do you really have a boyfriend ?
or were you just ?
was that just part of the whole thing with them ?
so how' d it go ?
you lahiri ?
i' m section chief molly starr .
i spoke to a very nice man at europoi this morning , commissioner greisman . he wants you on the next filght to amsterdam .
there seems to be some irregularity with your paperwork .
that one .
let' s start with that one .
imagine yourself in a room ... ... that' s too short for you to stand up in and not wide enough for you to lle down in .
a room with no llght , no heat ... ... and stone walls scratched by the teeth and nalls of desperate men ... ... men driven crazy by isolation .
you will have rats for company ... ... and a small window that looks out on the world that has passed you by .
your parents will grow old and die , just like your dreams .
your friends will forget your name , tell your stories as their own ... ... because what good is a story when the person who owns it has vanished ?
what do you want ?
testify against the others ... ... in the benedict case .
the itallan charges will be dropped .
you and the others will be extradited to the u. s. this afternoon .
plead , and you walk with parole .
i can' t .
think about it , linus .
for a moment there , i was already forgetting your name .
wait .
just hang on a sec .
linus .
right .
thanks .
you okay ?
well , i blew the meet with matsui .
matsui ?
let me guess . he pulled a lost in translation on you .
that' s his idea of fun for first timers .
i mean how do i not see these things ?
don' t get down on yourself .
obvious .
we talked about this .
i hope danny and rusty appreciate the job you did in a tight jam .
i am proud of you .
thanks .
we both are .
you ?
you told dad ?
i had to , sweetheart .
you told dad ?
we were on vacation .
i' m sorry .
great .
thanks .
you' re gonna be dining out on this one for months . " hey , remember the time your mom had to come to rome ....
i' m sorry .
every time with him .
it' s like ....
it' s like a ....
it' s like a ....
that was for keeping me in the dark .
and that that ... ... is for making me a master thief .
and that ...
okay . ... is for ruining our second third anniversary .
okay .
okay ?
come here .
i' m sorry i kept you in the dark .
i' m sorry that i made you a thief .

master thief .
and i' m very sorry that i ruined our second third anniversary .

what was bruce willis like ?
was he ?
follow it .
that' s ryan' s car .
follow that one .
hey , wait , wait !
what the hell is going on ?
your father' s alive , izzy .
your mom lled to you ...
... to keep you from him . he' s alive .
what are you talking about ?
when they divorced , she told him if he contacted you , she' d go to the cops ... ... with everything to put him in jall . how do you know that ?
and why should i believe you ?
i don' t believe you , okay ?
you know where he is ?
i know somebody who does .
there' s nothing back there but a forged 1 077 .
no .
really ?
no .
no .
that' d be horrible .
it' s hard , you know , for dinners .
well , you must have very good contacts .
i hear it usually takes days to buy your way out .
tess , this is franois toulour .
madame ocean , at iast . hello . he' s french .
shouldn' t you be somewhere else by now , like ... ... outer mongolla , maybe ?
well , before we get to that , we just wanted to ask you one question .
what is that ? how' d you do it ?
oh , so that' s why you came .
you wanna know .
well , i guess that' s normal .
but i got another deal for you .
you both recognize that i' m the best , and i' il tell you my secret .
yeah .
that ....
make it if you get him to tell us ...
... and tell him that he is the best .
oh , okay .
i won' t tell him because you' re the best .
all right .
thank you .
all right .
we' il tell you you' re the best after you tell us how you did it .
how can i refuse a dying man' s iast request ?
the egg arrived in rome at 6 : 45 p . m . the saturday before it went on display .
it was at the museum by 8 p . m .
wait a minute , hold on .
you stole it that evening ?
with the museum locked down ?
how' d you get in the building ?
how' d you get past the sensors ?
why didn' t my recon team see you ?
don' t touch my thing .
i didn' t touch your thing .
like it works .
you got greasy hands , you put them on the iens .
now i can' t see .
you can' t see anything .
i see you .
you look like a retard .
you look like a retard .
i' il pay you a million dollars if you don' t speak for a month .
one month .
i wanna eat your whole head .
go ahead .
a million dollars .
no joke .
right .
with no equipment , no rope .
of course .
come on , don' t tell me you don' t know how to do that . how did you get by the iaser field in the great hall ?
the iaser fields .
well ....
okay .
toulour , you' re the best .
well , thank you , danny .
good .
now , if you can just get us our money ... ... we' il be going .
the money ?
what money ?
the money that you agreed to pay benedict if we won .
we' re under a deadilne .
no , no , no , you don' t understand .
you didn' t win .
you iost .
and not only did you iose ... ... your entire crew got pinched .
i gotta tell you something .
you don' t look anything like her .
eventually , the nose , but the ears
i mean , the way you walk and you dress ....
that means that you spoke to lemarc .
you spoke to lemarc ?
since i' m dead , i think my involvement in this should stay among the three of us .
of course .
absolutely .
it' s ironic that the solution to all of our problems will be provided by toulour .
i' m sure i provoked him by agreeing with my american friend that you might be better .
i apologize sincerely for the trouble i' ve caused you .
there' s no need .
especially now .
remember , from the time you see toulour at his villa and the challenge begins ... ... you must assume he will have you under survelllance everywhere you go .
you' il have to put on a very elaborate show .
the egg , the reai egg ... ... will be carried in a backpack on a train ieaving gare du nord ...
... at 9 : 30 a . m .
thank you .
you saved our lives , gaspar .
yeah .
and i' m still getting the better of you .
and i stole a repilca ?
your paintings are in a high security warehouse in milan .
it' s 1 7 via andreotti , unit 222 .
security code is 2 3 1 1 6  6 4 6 .
thank you .
listen , all games aside , that was that was very good .
that was good . how' d you do that ?
well , i told you one story tonight .
i think that' il be enough .
so now ... ... if you , both of you , could please ....
now .
whose house is this ?
it belongs to a thief i know in paris . he knows my father ?
probably better than anyone .
who is he ? he helped with the whole night fox thing .
what' s his name ? his reai name ?
i don' t know , actually .
i' ve only known him as lemarc .
lemarc ?
oh , my god .
where the hell have you been ?
waiting .
for what ?
for this .
oh , my god .
so we done ?
issue closed ?
is it actually good ?
it' s good .
trust me .
i don' t trust you , and i don' t trust ocean .
if it' s good , we' re done .
these grudges , they' re awful .
nobody wins .
danny' s had enough of this meshugaas .
and the competition , it' s worse than our business .
always some new young punk trying to prove himself .
guys like ocean , they keep coming back .
they don' t like to iose .
too much ego , too much pride .
maybe for some guys , but not danny .
trust me on that .
danny don' t feel like he iost in all this .
it' s hard to believe , but that' s how he feels .
well , if he tries anything if anybody tries anything , i' il be waiting .
terry , i can' t predict the future .
i pay professionals to do that , and even they get it wrong sometimes .
i can' t say that nobody' il ever try to rob from you again .
if , god forbid , anything does happen to you ... ... we will not be involved .
you better not be , reuben .
you better not be .
hey .
good to see you guys .
you don' t remember ?
you put me through hell , and you don' t remember ?
hey . hey .
you' re more beautifui than ever . hey !
five oh five ?
four oh five .
who' s winning ?
i' m llttle .
and you' re big .
you' re big ?
