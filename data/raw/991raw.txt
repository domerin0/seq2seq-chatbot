choose life .
choose a job .
choose a career , a family .
choose a fucking big tv .
choose washing machines , cars , compact disc players .
choose good health .
low cholesterol and dental insurance .
choose mortgage repayments .
choose a home .
choose your friends !
choose leisurewear and matching luggage .
choose a three piece suite on hire purchase !
wondering who the fuck you are on a sunday morning .
choose watching mind numbing , spirit crushing game shows .
stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth .
' choose rotting away at the end ,
' in a miserable home ,
' nothing more than an embarrassment
' to the brats you' ve spawned .
' choose your future .
' choose life . '
but why would i want to do a thing like that ?
i chose not to choose life .
i chose something else .
and the reasons ?
there are no reasons .
who needs reasons when you' ve got heroin ?
goldfinger' s better than dr no .
both of them are a lot better than diamonds are forever .
a judgement reflected in its relatively poor showing at the box office .
in which field , of course ,
thunderball was a notable success .
' people think it' s all about misery
' and desperation and death and all that shite ,
' which is not to be ignored . '
fuck off !
jealous cunt !
' but what they forget ...
' is the pleasure of it . '
all dead !
white meat !
you prick !
' otherwise , we wouldn' t do it . '
you want me to do it ?
yes .
pure as driven snow , that shit .
' after all , we' re not fucking stupid .
' or at least , we' re not that fucking stupid . '
' take the best orgasm you ever had .
' multiply it by a thousand
' and you' re still nowhere near it . '
oh , it beats any meat injection !
that beats any fucking cock in the world !
' when you' re on junk , you' ve only one worry scoring .
' when you' re off it , you worry about all sorts of shite .
' no money , can' t get pissed .
' can' t get a bird .
got a bird , too much hassle .
' you worry about bills , food ,
' some football team that never wins .
' about human relationships
' and things that don' t matter
' when you have a sincere , truthful junk habit . '
i' d say in those days he was a muscular actor .
with all the presence of someone like cooper or lancaster combined with a sly wit ... to make him a formidable lead .
and closer in that respect to cary grant .
' the principal drawback is you have to endure cunts saying ... '
no way would i poison my body with that shite .
all they fucking chemicals ?
no fucking way !
it' s a waste of your life .
poisoning your body with that shite .
every chance you' ve had , son , you' ve blown it .
stuffing your veins with that filth !
' from time to time , even i have uttered the magic words . '
never again , swanney .
i' m off the skag .
are you serious ?
no more .
i' m finished .
it' s up to you .
i want off it for good .
i' ve heard it before .
the sick boy method .
it really worked for him .
well , he lacks moral fibre .
he' s a sean connery expert .
that' s hardly a substitute .
you' il need one more hit .
i don' t think so .
for the long night ahead .
' we called him mother superior
' on account of the length of his habit .
' of course i' d have another shot .
i had work to do . '
relinquishing junk , stage one preparation .
for this you will need : a room which you won' t leave , soothing music .
tomato soup , ten tins of ; mushroom soup , eight tins of for consumption cold .
ice cream vanilla , one large tub of .
magnesia , milk of one bottle .
paracetamol , mouthwash , vitamins ,
mineral water ,
lucozade , pornography .
one mattress .
buckets for urine , faeces and vomitus .
one television and one bottle of valium procured from my mother who is , in her own domestic and socially acceptable way , also a drug addict .
now i' m ready .
i just need one final hit to soothe the pain till the valium takes effect .
mikey ?
yeah , it' s mark renton .
i wondered , could you help me out ?
' this was typical of mikey forrester . '
what the fuck are these ?
' normally , i have nothing to do with him
' but things were not normal . '
opium suppositories !
ideal for your purposes .
slow release .
bring you down gradually .
custom fucking designed for your needs .
i want a fucking hit !
it' s all i' ve got , mate .
take it or leave it .
feelin ' better now ?
i might as well have stuck them up my arse .
heroin makes you constipated .
the heroin from my last hit is fading away and the suppositories have yet to melt .
i' m no longer constipated .
i fantasize about a massive , pristine convenience .
brilliant gold taps , virginal white marble , a seat carved from ebony , a cistern full of chanel no . 5 , a flunky handing me pieces of silk toilet roll .
but under the circumstances ,
i' il settle for anywhere .
the worst toilets in scotland
yes , ya fucking dancer !
and now ...
now i' m ready .
the downside of coming off junk was mixing with my friends again in a state of full consciousness .
they were so like me , i could hardly bear to look at them .
sick boy came off junk too , just to show me how easily he could do it .
when all i wanted to do was feel sorry for myself , he insisted on telling me his theory of life .
certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life .
what d' you mean ?
well , at one point you' ve got it , then you lose it .
then it' s gone forever .
all walks of life .
georgie best , for example , had it lost it .
or david bowie or lou reed .
his solo stuff' s not bad .
no .
but it' s not great either .
and in your heart you know that although it sounds all right , it' s actually just ... shite .
so who else ?
charlie nicholas , david niven , malcolm mclaren ,
elvis presley ...
ok , ok .
what' s the point you' re making ?
all i' m trying to do , mark , is to help you understand that the name of the rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory .
what about the untouchables ?
i don' t rate that at all .
despite the academy award ?
that means fuck all .
it' s a sympathy vote .
so we all get old , we cannae hack it any more and that' s it ?
yeah .
that' s your theory ?
yeah .
beautifully fucking illustrated .
give me the gun .
give me the gun .
have you got the beast in your sights ?
clear enough , miss moneypenny .
this should present no significant problems .
for a vegetarian , rents , you' re a fucking evil shot !
' without heroin ,
' i led a useful and fulfilling life as a good citizen . '
good luck , spud .
cheers , cat boy .
if they think you' re no tryin ' , you' re doomed .
they' il be on to the dss and your giro' s fucking finished , right ?
right .
but try too hard ...
you might get the job !
exactly .
nightmare !
it' s a tightrope , spud .
a fucking tightrope !
i get pure shy with the interviewer cats .
i can' t answer the questions .
i get nerves , like footballers on big occasions .
try some of this .
some speed just the ticket , man .
naw , i went to craigie craignewton .
i put royal edinburgh college to help get the job .
there' s too much discrimination here .
they' re both schools , right .
i put across the idea .
people get hung up on details .
like how many o grades i got .
maybe six .
maybe none .
it' s not important .
what' s important is that i am .
do you mean you lied on your application ?
no ... well , yes .
to get my foot in the door .
showing initiative .
you were referred by the department of employment .
your foot was in the door .
yeah , cool .
whatever you say , man .
sorry .
you' re the man .
the dude in the chair .
i am merely here .
obviously .
what exactly attracts you to the leisure industry ?
in a word , pleasure .
like , my pleasure in other people' s leisure .
do you see yourself as having any weaknesses ?
oh , yes !
i' m a bit of a perfectionist .
for me , it' s the best or nothin ' at all .
things get dodgy i cannot be bothered .
but i' m getting good vibes about this interview .
seems to me it' s going pretty well , eh ?
thank you , mr murphy .
we' il let you know .
the pleasure was mine .
' spud had done well .
' he made me proud .
fucked up good and proper . '
picture the scene .
the other fucking week there , down the volley with tommy playing pool .
i' m playing like paul newman , giving the boy a tanning .
it comes to the last shot , the deciding ball of the tournament .
i' m on the black , he looks biscuit arsed .
when this hard cunt comes in .
obviously fucking fancied himself , like .
starts staring at me .
looking right fucking at me as if to say , " come ahead .
you ken me .
i' m not the type that goes looking for bother but i had a pool cue and he' d get it in his puss !
so i squares up , casual like .
what does the hard cunt do ?
the so called hard cunt ?
shites it !
puts down his drink and gets the fuck out of there .
and after that ... well , the game was mine .
' and that was it .
' that was begbie' s story .
' or begbie' s version of the story .
' later , i got the truth from tommy .
' you always got the truth from tommy .
' he never lied , never took drugs ,
' never cheated on anyone . '
it was wednesday morning .
we were in the volley , playing pool .
that' s true .
but begbie is playing absolutely fucking gash .
his hangover' s so bad , he can hardly hold the fucking cue !
i' m doing my best to lose , trying to humour him .
but every time i touch a ball , i pot something .
every time begbie goes near the table , he fucks it up .
fuck' s sake ... !
so , he' s got the hump .
but i set him up to pot the black , win one game , salvage his pride and not kick me in .
so , he' s on the black ...
' pressure shot ...
' which goes wrong , big time . '
' he picks on this wee gadge ,
' accusing him of putting him off .
' he hadn' t even glanced at us . '
fuck off !
' he' d have chibbed him . '
then i thought he was gonna do me .
the beggar' s fucking psycho .
but he' s a mate .
what can you do ?
can i borrow this ?
' what indeed could one do ?
' try not to get involved . '
' begbie didn' t do drugs .
he did people .
' he got off on it .
his own sensory addiction . '
nobody move !
the lassie got glassed .
no cunt moves till we know who did it .
who the fuck are you ?
yes !
' as i sat watching
' the highly personal video
' stolen only hours earlier from one of my best friends ,
' i realised that something was missing from my life . '
how' s it going with gail ?
no joy yet .
how long is it ?
six weeks .
six weeks !
nightmare right .
she told me she didn' t want our relationship to start out on a physical basis as that is how it principally is going to be defined from then on .
when did she come up with that ?
she read it in cosmopolitan .
six weeks and no sex ?
i' ve got balls like fucking watermelons i' m telling you .
i read it in cosmopolitan .
interesting theory .
actually , it' s a nightmare .
i' m desperate for a shag but watching him suffer was just too much fun .
try it wi ' tommy .
it' s the only pleasure i get from him !
you know about my birthday ?
no .
he forgot .
useless motherfucker !
useless motherfucker ; that' s what she called me .
i said to her , look i' m sorry but these things happen , let' s put it behind us .
that' s fair enough .
yes , but then she finds out i' ve got a ticket for iggy pop the same night .
was she upset ?
very , " it' s me or iggy pop , time to decide .
so what are you going to do ?
well i' ve paid for the ticket .
what are you two talking about ?
football .
what are you talking about ?
shopping .
' the situation was becoming serious .
' renton noticed the haste with which
' the successful in the sexual sphere ,
' as in all others , segregated themselves from the failures . '
' heroin had robbed renton of his sex drive
' but now it returned with a vengeance .
' the impotence of those days faded
' and desperation took a hold on his sex crazed mind .
' post junk libido , fuelled by alcohol and amphetamine
' taunted him with his own unsatisfied desire .
' dot , dot , dot . '
' and with that ,
' mark renton had fallen in love . '
excuse me .
i don' t mean to harrass you but i was very impressed with the way you dealt with that situation .
i think you' re special .
thanks .
your name ?
diane .
where are you going ?
home .
where' s that ?
it' s where i live .
great .
what ?
i' il come back with you but i' m not promising anything .
does this approach usually work ?
or have you never tried it before ?
you don' t normally approach girls , right ?
you' re a quiet , sensitive type but if i' m prepared to take a chance ,
i' il get to know the inner you .
witty , adventurous , passionate , loving , loyal ...
taxi !
a little bit crazy , a little bit bad .
but hey , don' t us girls just love that
well ?
what' s wrong , boy ?
cat got your tongue ?
i left something ...
are you getting in ?
do you understand ?
you will be a considerate and thoughtful lover .
generous ... but firm .
failure on your part to live up to these very reasonable expectations will result in swift resumption of a non sex situation .
right ?
what ?
shut up !
wake up , spud .
wake up .
sex !
casual sex !
tommy , put the tape on .
what ?
i wanna watch ourselves while we' re screwing .
so let' s see what i' m missing .
not much !
' the captain , archie gemmill ,
' picking it up from the outside ...
' he' s going all the way ... and he scores !
' oh , what a magnificent goal !
' gemmill at his very best .
' what a penetrating goal that was . '
i haven' t felt that good since archie gemmill scored against holland in 1978 .
right .
you can' t sleep here .
what ?
out !
come on !
you can sleep on the hall sofa or go home .
and don' t make any noise .
jesus !
gone ?
where has it gone ?
it' il be here somewhere !
i might' ve returned it by mistake .
returned it ? !
where ?
the video shop , tommy ?
the fucking video shop ? !
so every punter in edinburgh' s jerking off to our video ?
oh , god , tommy , i feel sick !
hi .
hello .
fuck !
come in and sit down .
like some coffee ?
aye .
you must be mark .
aye , that' s me .
are you a friend of diane' s ?
more a friend of a friend .
right .
are you her flatmates , like ?
flatmates ? !
i must remember that one .
morning .
good morning , spud .
morning , gail .
mr houston .
mrs houston .
mornin ' , spud .
sit down and have some breakfast .
i' m sorry about last night , by the way .
that' s ok .
i slept fine on the sofa .
i had a bit much to drink .
had a bit of an accident .
dinnae worry .
does a man good to cut loose once in a while .
this one could do with being tied up .
i' il get the sheets washed .
i' il wash them .
no need .
it' s no problem .
or for me .
i' d rather take care of it .
really ...
no !
spud , they' re my sheets !
why not ?
because it' s illegal .
what , holding hands ?
no , not holding hands .
you were quite happy
to do a lot more last night .
that' s what' s illegal !
inside , they' d cut my balls off .
you' re not going to jail .
easy for you to say .
can i see you again ?
certainly not !
if you don' t see me again , i' il tell the police .
i' il see you around .
now what ?
we' re going for a walk .
a walk !
where ?
there !
are you serious ?
well , what are you waitin ' for ?
tommy ... this is not natural , man .
it' s the great outdoors !
fresh air !
we know lizzy' s giving you a hard time .
don' t take it out on us .
makes you proud to be scottish .
it' s shite being scottish !
we' re the lowest of the low .
the scum of the fuckin ' earth !
the most wretched , miserable , servile pathetic trash that was ever shat into civilisation !
some hate the english .
i don' t they' re just wankers .
we , on the other hand , are colonised by wankers .
can' t even find a decent culture to be colonised by .
we' re ruled by effete arseholes !
it' s a shite state of affairs .
all the fresh air in the world won' t make a fucking difference !
sorry , man .
it' s no ' like ...
no , i appreciate it , tommy .
' around this time ,
' spud , sick boy and i
' made a healthy , informed , democratic decision
' to get back on heroin as soon as possible .
' took about twelve hours . '
paul newman , right , he were doing the world a favour ...
' looks easy , this .
it' s not .
' looks like a doss , a soft option .
' but living like this is a full time business . '
ursula andress .
the quintessential bond girl that' s what everyone says .
the embodiment , right , of his superiority to us .
beautiful ... exotic ... highly sexual yet ... totally unavailable to anyone apart from him .
shite !
let' s face it , she' d shag one punter from edinburgh , she' d shag the whole fucking lot of us !
i knew he was gonna do that .
lizzy' s gone , mark .
she' s gone and fucking dumped me .
it was that video tape .
and that iggy pop business and other shite .
she told me where to go and no mistake .
i said to her ,
is there any chance of getting back together ?
no way .
no fucking way .
honor blackman , aka pussy galore .
right ?
what a total fucking misnomer !
i wouldnae touch her with yours !
i want to try it .
you' re always going on about how it' s the ultimate hit .
better than sex .
come on , man , i' m a fucking adult .
i can find out for myself .
i' ve got the money .
personality .
i mean , that' s what counts , right ?
personality .
that' s what keeps a relationship going through the years .
like heroin .
i mean , heroin' s got great fucking personality .
' swanney taught us
' to adore and respect the national health service .
' it was the source of much of our gear .
' we stole drugs .
' we stole prescriptions ,
' bought them , sold them , forged or photocopied them .
' or traded drugs with cancer victims , alcoholics ,
' old aged pensioners , alds patients ,
' epileptics and bored housewives .
' we took morphine , diamorphine ,
' cyclozine , codeine , temazepam ,
' nitrazepam , phenobarbitone ,
' sodium amytal , dextropropoxyphene , methadone ,
' nalbuphine , pethidine , pentazocine ,
' buprenorphine ,
' dextromoramide , chlormethiazole .
' the streets are awash with drugs
' you can have for unhappiness and pain .
' and we took them all .
' we would' ve injected vitamin c
' if they' d made it illegal ! '
the first day of the edinburgh festival
may i use your bathroom ?
thank you .
now rent boy , no fucking skag .
' but the good times couldn' t last forever . '
oh , my god , no !
please !
' i think allison had been screaming all day
' but it hadn' t really registered before .
' she might have been screaming for a week .
' it was days since i' d heard anyone speak .
' though surely someone must have said something
' in all that time . '
allison ?
allison !
help me , please !
cool down !
everything' s gonna be just fine .
' nothing could' ve been further from the truth .
' in fact , nothing was gonna be just fine .
' on the contrary , everything was gonna be bad .
' everything was gonna be even worse than it already was . '
fuck !
' it wasn' t my baby .
' she wasn' t my baby .
' baby dawn she wasn' t mine .
' spud' s , swanney' s ,
' sick boy' s ...
' i dunno .
' maybe allison knew .
maybe not .
' i wished i could think of something to say
' something sympathetic ,
' something human . '
say something , mark .
fucking say something !
i' m cooking up .
cook us up a shot , rents .
i really need a hit .
' and so she did
' i could understand that .
' to take the pain away .
' so i cooked up
' and she got a hit .
' but only after me
' that went without saying .
' well , we knew who the father was now .
' it wasn' t just the baby that died that day .
' something inside sick boy was lost and never returned .
' he had no theory to explain this moment .
nor did i.
' our only response was to keep going and fuck everything .
' pile misery on misery .
heat it on a spoon
' and dissolve it .
' then squirt it into a vein
' and do it all over again .
' keep on going out , robbing , fucking people over .
' propelling ourselves with longing
' towards the day it would all go wrong .
' because no matter how much you stash or steal ,
' you never have enough .
' no matter how often you go out and rob ,
' you always need to do it all over again .
' sooner or later ,
' this kind of thing was bound to happen . '
shoplifting is theft , which is a crime , and there is no such entity as victimless crime .
heroin addiction explains but doesn' t excuse your actions .
mr murphy , you are a habitual thief , devoid of remorse .
i sentence you to six months ' imprisonment .
i worry it will not be long till we meet again .
mr renton , you have entered a programme of rehabilitation in an attempt to wean yourself away from heroin .
the suspension of your sentence depends on your continued cooperation with this programme .
stand guilty before me again and i won' t hesitate to impose a custodial sentence .
thank you , your honour .
with god' s help , i' il conquer this terrible affliction .
' what can you say ?
' begbie had a phrase for it . '
it was obvious that cunt was gonna fuck some cunt .
have you learnt your lesson ?
my son !
i thought i was gonna lose you .
you' re nothing but trouble but i still love you !
clean up your fucking act .
cut that shite out .
francis is talking sense .
fucking right .
see , inside , you wouldn' t last two days .
there' s better things than the needle .
choose life .
my wee baby .
# oh , mamma' s little baby ...
# loves shortening , shortening
# mamma' s little baby loves shortening bread !
i' m sorry , mrs murphy .
it wasn' t fair , spud going down and not me .
well , it' s no ' our fault !
your boy went down because he was a smackhead .
if that' s not your fault then i don' t know what is .
i tried to get him off it .
i' il get the drinks in , eh ?
' wish i' d gone down , not spud .
' here i was surrounded by my family
' and so called mates
' and i' ve never felt so alone .
' never in my puff .
' since i was on remand ,
' they' ve had me on this programme .
' the state sponsored addiction .
' three sickly sweet doses of methadone a day
' instead of smack .
it' s never enough .
' right now , it' s nowhere near enough .
' i took all three earlier .
' 18 hours to my next shot
' and the sweat on my back' s like a layer of frost .
' i need to visit the mother superior for one hit .
' one fucking hit
' to get us over this long , hard day . '
what' s on the menu this evening , sir ?
your favourite dish .
excellent .
usual table , sir ?
why , thank you .
would sir care to pay for his bill in advance ?
no , stick it on my tab .
credit limit was reached and breached some time ago .
well , in that case ...
ah , hard currency .
that' il do nicely .
can' t be too careful when dealing with your type , sir .
would sir care for a starter ?
some garlic bread ?
no , thanks .
i' il proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs .
as you wish , sir .
as you wish .
perhaps sir would like me to call for a taxi ?
open your eyes !
wake up !
come on , wake up !
' i don' t feel the sickness yet
' but it' s in the post , that' s for sure .
' i' m in the junkie limbo at the moment .
' too ill to sleep ...
' too tired to stay awake . '
' but the sickness is on its way .
' sweat , chills , nausea ,
' pain and craving .
' need like nothing else i' ve ever known
' will soon take hold of me .
' it' s on its way .
# ooh , you' ve got green eyes
# ooh , you' ve got blue eyes
# ooh , you' ve got grey eyes
# and i' ve never seen anyone
# quite like you before
# no , i' ve never met anyone
# quite like you before
we' il help you , son .
you stay here till you get better .
we' il beat this together .
i should go to the clinic .
no .
no clinics .
no methadone .
it made you worse .
you said so yourself .
you lied to us , son .
your own mother and father !
you can bring some jellies ...
no !
you' re worse coming off that than you are with the heroin .
a clean break this time .
we' il keep an eye on you .
i appreciate what you' re trying to do but just bring me one more hit , plea ...
i need one more fucking hit !
you fuck !
fuck it !
fuck it !
well ... this is a good fucking laugh , isn' t it ?
you sweat that shite out your system .
if i come back and it' s still here ,
i' il fucking kick it out .
ok ?
god !
question number one .
the human immunodeficiency virus is a ... ?
retrovirus .
retrovirus is the right answer !
it' s a mug' s game , mrs renton .
i mean , i' m not saying i was blameless myself .
the time comes when you have to turn your back on that nonsense and just say no .
just say no .
it' s dawn !
she' s dead !
not baby dawn .
question number two .
hlv binds to which receptor on the host lymphocyte ?
which receptor is that ?
cd4 .
cd4 is the right answer !
better than sex , rents ?
better than sex ?
the ultimate hit .
i' m a fucking adult ,
i can find out for myself .
well , i' m finding out , all right !
tommy !
stop it .
just fucking stop .
stop it .
is he guilty ... or not guilty ?
mummy !
he' s our son .
stop looking at me !
stop !
mark !
there' s something you need to do .
come alive , 35 .
box of tricks , 66 .
mark !
mark , you' ve got a house !
house !
house !
for goodness sake , mark .
' it seems , however ,
' i really am the luckiest guy in the world .
' several years of addiction
' right in the middle of an epidemic ,
' surrounded by the living dead .
' but not me .
i' m negative .
' it' s official .
' and once the pain goes ,
' that' s when the real battle starts .
' depression , boredom
' you' re so low , you want to top yourself . '
tommy !
tommy , it' s mark , man .
all right , mate ?
getting out much , tommy ?
no .
following the game at all ?
no .
nah .
me neither , really .
did you take the test ?
aye .
clear ?
aye .
that' s nice .
i' m sorry , tommy .
you got any gear on you ?
no .
i' m clean , man .
well ... sub us then , mate .
i' m expecting a rent cheque .
thanks , mark .
no bother .
' no bother .
' none at all .
' not for me , anyway .
' still , it' s easy to be philosophical
' when it' s some other poor cunt with shite for blood . '
what do you want ?
are you clean ?
yes .
is that a promise ?
it is , actually !
i' m only asking .
is that hash i can smell ?
no .
i wouldn' t mind some .
it isn' t .
it smells like it .
you' re too young .
i' m too young for what ?
you' re not getting any younger , mark .
the world' s changing , music' s changing , even drugs are changing .
you can' t stay in dreaming about heroin and ziggy pop .
it' s iggy pop .
whatever .
the guy' s dead , anyway .
iggy toured last year .
tommy went to see him .
the point is , you' ve got to find something new .
' she was right .
i had to find something new .
' only one thing for it . '
lifestyle letting agency .
a beautifully converted victorian townhouse .
' ideally located in a quiet road
' near to local shops .
' this one' s two bedrooms and a kitchen/ diner .
' fully fitted .
excellent decorative order .
' lots of storage space , all mod cons .
' and it' s going at ... 320 a week .
' i settled in not too badly ,
' kept myself to myself .
' sometimes i thought about the guys
' but mainly , i didn' t miss them .
' this was boom town
' where any fool could make cash from chaos . '
i' ve got a beautifully converted victorian townhouse .
' i enjoyed the sound of it
' profit , loss , margins ,
' takeovers , lending , letting ,
' sub letting , sub dividing .
' cheating , scamming , breaking away . '
who' s got the keys to talgarth road ?
' if society existed , i had nothing to do with it .
' for the first time ,
' i was almost content . '
' dear mark ,
' glad you found a job and somewhere to live .
' school' s fine at the moment .
' i' m not pregnant thanks for asking .
' sick boy wanted me to work for him .
' i told him where to go .
' met spud .
he sends his regards .
' i think that' s what he said . '
tell marky ...
tell him ...
' no one has seen tommy for ages .
' and francis begbie has been on tv a lot .
' he' s wanted by the police
' because of an armed robbery in a jeweller' s .
' take care .
yours , with love , diane . '
' francis begbie ... '
armed robbery ?
how could it be armed robbery with a fucking replica ?
a scandal .
and the gear .
look .
supposed to be solid silver it' s fucking garbage !
there' s young couples invest all their hopes in that stuff .
it' s a scandal .
fucking right .
another one of the wee pot noodles ?
i' m fucking lee marvin !
hey , rents .
' begbie settled in in no time at all . '
i' ve no fucking cigarettes .
aye , right .
it' s me .
rents !
' yeah , the guy' s a psycho .
' but it' s true
' he' s a mate an ' all so what can you do ? '
nip down the bookies and put a line on for us .
can you no ' go yourself ?
seeing as i' m a fugitive from the law and i cannae walk the fucking streets , you go .
here .
doncaster .
four forty .
five pound to win bad boy .
fucking ...
bring some fucking beer an ' all .
come on , bad boy .
come on , son .
come on , son .
bad boy !
' came in at 16 to one .
' and with the winnings ,
' diane was right
' the world is changing .
' music is changing ,
' drugs are changing .
men and women are changing .
' one thousand years from now ,
' there' il be no guys or girls , just wankers .
' sounds great to me .
' it' s just a pity no one told begbie . '
fuck !
fuck !
' we' re heterosexual by default , not by decision .
' it' s just a question of who you fancy .
' it' s all about aesthetics and fuck all to do with morality . '
fuck !
' but you try telling begbie that . '
i' m not a fucking buftie !
it could have been wonderful .
fucking listen to me , piece of junkie shit !
you mention that again and i' il cut you up .
you understand ?
' since i last saw him ,
' sick boy had reinvented himself
' as a pimp and a pusher .
' and was here , he said , to mix business and pleasure .
' setting up contacts
' for the great skag deal
' that was one day gonna make him rich . '
good chips .
i can' t believe you did that .
i got a good price for it .
i need the money .
it was my fucking telly !
if i' d known you' d get so humpty about it ,
i wouldn' t have bothered .
fucking rented , anyway .
you gonna eat that ?
have you got a passport ?
why ?
i met this bloke .
runs a hotel ...
brothel .
loads of contacts .
does a nice side line in punting british passports to foreigners .
get you a good price .
and why would i want to sell my passport ?
it was just an idea .
' i had to get rid of them .
' sick boy didn' t do his drug deal and didn' t get rich .
' he and begbie hung around my bedsit looking to steal things .
' i decided to put them in the worst place in the world . '
' but of course , they weren' t paying any rent .
' so when my boss found two suckers who would ,
' sick boy and begbie were bound to feel threatened . '
lots of storage .
all mod cons .
320 quid a week .
' and that was that .
' but we had another reason to go back .
tommy . '
tommy knew he had the virus but not that he' d gone full blown .
was it pneumonia or cancer ?
no toxoplasmosis .
it' s like a stroke .
how' s that ?
he wanted to see lizzy again .
she wouldn' t let him near the house .
so he bought her a present .
this kitten .
bet lizzy told him where to fuckin ' stick it .
i don' t want a cat , " she says .
so there' s tommy stuck with this kitten .
you can imagine what happened .
to those gathered here today ,
thomas mckenzie filled a number of roles in our lives ...
the thing was neglected .
pissing and shitting all over .
tommy' s lying about fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers .
he never knew you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit .
he had a great lust for life .
neither did i. what is it ?
fucking horrible .
it' s like an abscess on your brain .
fucking hell .
then what happened ?
he starts getting headaches .
so he uses more smack , you know , for the pain , like .
and then he has a stroke .
a fucking stroke !
just like that .
gets home from the hospital and dies three weeks later .
he' d been dead for ages before neighbours complained about the smell and got the police to break down the door .
tommy was lying in a pool of vomit .
the kitten was fine .
all please rise for the committal .
# did you think i would leave you crying
# when there' s room on my horse for two ?
# climb up here , tommy
# don' t be dying
# i can go just as fast with two
# when we grow up
# we' il both be soldiers
# and our horses will not be toys
# and i wonder if we' il remember
# when we were two little boys
did you tell him yet ?
on you go .
what ?
swanney' s mate ...
you know him mikey forrester .
aye .
he' s come into some gear .
a lot of gear .
how much gear ?
about two kilos .
so he tells me .
he got drunk in a pub by the docks last week .
met two russian sailors .
they' re fucking carrying the stuff .
for sale there and then , like .
he wakes up next morning , realises what he' s done , gets very nervous .
he wants rid of this .
so ?
so , he met me .
i offered to take it at a reasonable price so i could punt it on to a guy in london .
we' re just back from tommy' s funeral and you' re discussing a skag deal ?
aye .
what was your price ?
four grand .
you haven' t got four grand .
we' re 2, 000 short .
well , that' s tough .
mark , every cunt knows you' ve been saving up down in london .
i don' t have two grand .
you fucking do .
i' ve seen your bank statement .
for fuck' s sake !
two thousand , one hundred and thirty three pound .
two kilos .
what' s that , ten years ?
mikey forrester , russian sailors what the fuck are you on ?
spud , you' ve been to jail .
you want to go back ?
i just want the money .
keep your mouths shut and no cunt goes to jail .
' there were a lot of possibilities
' running through my mind
' about what might happen in london .
' things i didn' t want to talk to anyone about .
' ideas best kept to myself .
' what no one told me was that when we bought the skag ,
' some lucky punter would have to try it out .
' begbie didn' t trust spud
' and sick boy was too careful these days .
' so i rolled up my sleeve ,
' i spiked my vein
' and i did what had to be done . '
it' s good .
oh , it' s really fucking good !
' that hit was good .
' i promised myself another before i got to london .
' just one , for old time' s sake .
' just to piss begbie off .
' this was his nightmare .
' the dodgiest scam in a life of dodgy scams .
' being perpetrated with three of the most useless
' and unreliable fuck ups in town .
' i knew what was going on in his mind
' any trouble in london and he would dump us .
' if he got caught with a bag of skag
' on top of that armed robbery , he' d go down for 15 to 20 .
' begbie was hard but not so hard
' that he didn' t shite it off 20 years in saughton .
' this was to be my final hit .
' but let' s be clear
' there' s final hits and final hits .
' what kind was this to be ? '
did you bring the cards ?
what ?
i told you to mind the cards .
i' ve not brought them .
it' s fucking boring without the cards .
i' m sorry .
bit fucking late , like .
why didn' t you bring them ?
i told you to , doss cunt !
christ !
these your friends , right ?
these are the guys i told you about .
well , is he here ?
yeah , he' s here .
you didn' t get followed or nothing ?
didn' t get followed .
ok .
all right ?
hi .
' straight away ,
' he saw what we were .
' small time wasters with an accidental big deal . '
excuse me , gentlemen .
so ... how much would you like for this ?
20, 000 .
i don' t think it' s worth much more than 15 .
' he didn' t need to negotiate .
' what would we do if he didn' t buy it ?
' sell it on the streets ?
fuck that . '
well , 19 .
i' m terribly sorry .
i can' t go to 19 .
well , fucking 16 then .
ok .
well , fucking 16 it is , then .
these , gentlemen , are 2, 000 bundles .
that' s two ...
that' s four ...
' we settled on 16, 000 .
' he' d a lot more in his suitcase
' but it was better than nothing . '
thank you , gentlemen .
may i say it' s been a pleasure haggling with you .
fucking brand new .
' for a moment ,
' it felt great .
' like we were in it together ,
' like it meant something .
' a moment like that can touch you
' but it doesn' t last long .
not like 16, 000 . '
spud , any investments planned ?
gonna buy an island in the sun ?
for 4, 000 ?
one palm tree and a sewage outflow !
i don' t know , man .
i' m gonna get something for my ma .
and some good speed .
no bicarb .
get a girl , take her out , treat her right ...
and shag her ?
no , man !
true love .
true love .
but i could handle hot sex with a jewish princess tonight !
ya daft cunt !
or a catholic .
don' t waste it .
get the drinks .
i got a round already .
i got the last one .
your round , franco .
ok .
same again ?
i' m off for a piss .
see when i get back , that money' s still here , ok ?
no , we' re out the door .
i' il be after you .
you' il never catch us , flabby .
but when i get back ...

i' d fucking kill you .
i thought you might .
thought you might .
are you game for it ?
what ?
well ?
are you serious ?
don' t know .
don' t know .
what d' you think ?
still here , i see .
oh , aye .
wouldn' t run out on a mate .
i would .

you ?
hey , rent boy , bring me down a fucking smoke .
we' d better go .
to hospital .
you' re not going to hospital .
stay there .
you bring me down a fucking cigarette .
and the bag .
' now i' ve justified this to myself
' in all sorts of ways .
' it wasn' t a big deal
' just a minor betrayal .
' or we' d outgrown each other ,
' that sort of thing .
' but let' s face it , i ripped them off
' my so called mates .
' but begbie , i couldn' t give a shit about him .
' and sick boy , he' d have done the same to me ,
' if he' d only thought of it first .
' and spud ...
well , ok , i felt sorry for spud .
' he never hurt anybody .
bastard !
move away , everybody .
what' s going on in there ?
open up .
open up now !
' so why did i do it ?
' i could offer a million answers , all false .
' the truth is that i' m a bad person .
' but that' s gonna change .
' i' m going to change .
this is the last of that .
' now i' m cleaning up , going straight and choosing life .
' i' m looking forward to it .
' i' m gonna be just like you
' the job , the family , the fucking big television ,
' the washing machine , the car , the compact disc .
' good health , low cholesterol ,
' mortgage , starter home , leisure wear , luggage ,
' three piece suite , dly .
' game shows , junk food , children .
' walks in the park , nine to five ,
' good at golf , washing the car , choice of sweaters .
