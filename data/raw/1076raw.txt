you' re not disappointed ?
no .
i' il just go by myself .

well , what about the father ?
well , that' s sort of confusing .
it' s either david lee roth , who' s on tour , or sean penn .
and i' d really hate to upset madonna .
fill this out .
ok .
how far did we get yesterday ?
you took roll .
right .
that shouldn' t take as long today .
pam .
mr. shoop , i gotta book .
what ?
you just got here .
yeah .
it' s a female thing .
oh , yeah , i understand .
oh , man , she' s going surfing !
i' m sure .
fuck .
this menstruation deal , it' s such a scam .
girls are so lucky .
what ?
oh , we' re so lucky ?
you think being on your period is some picnic ?
are you crazy ?
you get pms , there' s no room in your purse for no hairbrush because you got these mini pads .
you are so ignorant !
this whole class is jammed with ignorance .
yes , it is .
come in here , please .
mr. shoop , this is our new foreign exchange student ,
anna maria mazarelli .
anna maria is from milan , italy .
she would like to brush up her english skills before the fall semester begins .
well , i' il let you return to your rigorous pursuit of academic excellence .
please .
anna maria , welcome to america .
you can sit wherever you want .
you looking for a seat ?
well , now , this desk appears to be unoccupied .
grazie .
ok , let' s see what we got here .
rules of grammar .
writing paragraphs .
god , i hate this stuff .
book reports .
wanna get out of here ?
go to the library ?
yeah .
yeah .
let' s go .
i am chainsaw .
hi , chainsaw .
hi , i' m dave .
ciao .
hi , i' m dave .
ciao .
well , we love italy .
yeah .
the pizza .
mussolini .
and tony bennett .
the mafia .
yeah .
chef boyardee .
pinocchio .
fellatio .
oh , i don' t like that .
well , have you ever tried it ?
sure .
chef boyardee , spaghetti in a can .
it' s so mushy .
anna maria ?
have you seen the movie texas chainsaw massacre ?
no .
it is good ?
oh , i gotta tell you , i love this film .
it had passion and a plucky spirit .
and the characters had integrity .
like when leatherface went on a strict diet of human flesh .
he had to cut out chicken and fish .
i agree with you .
i' il go a step further .
leatherface wore a mask made out of human skin , he hung people on meat hooks , but we' ve all got quirks .
i' ve got them .
you got them .
that' s what makes this character so compelling .
thumbs up from me .
same here .
to sum it up , i' m chainsaw .
i' m dave .
we' il see you at the movies .
ok .
let' s go , people .
i found them at winchell' s .
here , we all chipped in .
hey , jelly .
i' m touched .
this one was in the parking lot with a surfboard .
this is so humiliating .
pam .
you know , i grew up surfing those same waves .
today was phenom .
three to four , breaking out of the south , glassy , light offshore breeze .
had to go for the ditch .
thanks .
you' re very spiritual .
but the rest of you clowns ...
hey , i gotta say something .
this whole thing is a joke .
there' s a very valid reason for summer vacation .
the human brain needs rest .
yeah .
i mean , what are we doing here ?
really .
i don' t wanna be here .
hey , look , this wasn' t my idea .
you guys aren' t fired up about english .
i wouldn' t know what to do if you were .
but we' re stuck here .
we' re trapped like rats .
anybody got any ideas ?
why don' t we take some field trips ?
can we do that ?
sure , yeah .
i got permission slips right here .
ok , take these home , have your mom or dad sign them , i' il see what i can do .
done .
same here .
good .
the screwdriver was a disappointment .
i was hoping for a headache or pounding temples , a blackout , but , you know , i feel fine .
actually , my headache is gone .
thumbs down .
i' m surprised .
i found the screwdriver simply delightful .
fast corners .
that third loop was a surprise .
the line moved fast .
is he ok ?
no , it appears that he' s vomiting .
that' s a sure sign of a good ride .
thumbs up .
eakian , what did you eat ?
don' t be a pig .
no .
hey !
hey , you slime .
stones ' first farewell tour , ' 69 .
get out of here .
oh , wait .
he ripped my t shirt .
oh , i can sew that .
it' s not necessary .
go away !
nothing' s necessary .
i want to .
great , i' il let you .
get them off !
get them off me !
the bunnies from hell !
oh , god !
get away from me !
oh , dear !
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
thank you very much .
what is this ?
it' s a lie .
we did this for you .
how did you like it ?
it' s disgusting !
i love it .
what is that ?
oh , it' s foam latex .
keep it .
you guys .
next field trip , it' s gotta be at the beach .
we gotta see anna maria in a bikini .
it' s very important .
i understand .
girl , this ain' t the riviera .
thank you .
that was ...
that was ...
that was cruel .
you ok ?
come in , come in , mrs. eakian .
now , how can i help you ?
yesterday alan came home nauseous , sneezing , wheezing and itching , with goat hairs on his clothes .
he said he was at the museum ,
but i found this in his pocket .
grandma ...
is going on throw up rides and rubbing barnyard animals your idea of quality education ?
grandma ...
certainly not .
we' il talk to mr. shoop about this right now .
i may have used poor judgment .
you actually used judgment .
do you realize if anything happened to these kids , the lawsuits ?
you could' ve bankrupt the entire district !
and mess up your chance at election to state assembly ?
yes .
don' t wet your pants .
watch this .
all you had to do was babysit some social deviants .
those deviants are great kids .
i' m sure they' il grow up to be wonderful criminals .
they' re as smart as you and me .
you and i.
all of us .
you' re suspended until kelban returns and fires you .
what ?
hey , this is your fault .
you knew i couldn' t teach .
goodbye , mr. shoop .
gills , what if i become a model teacher ?
this is gonna be fun .
ok .
you get every kid left in your class to pass that skills test and i' il forget about your field trips .
done .
they all have to pass ?
it' s called teaching .
if you don' t know how to do that , then i guess you don' t deserve tenure .
do you ?
i' il teach .
morning , class .
nice tie !
oh , baby .
mr. shoop , what' s with the threads , man ?
you getting married ?
no , must be laundry day .
nothing else was clean .
funeral ?
could we come ?
please take your seats .
where should we take them ?
sit down , francis .
from this moment forth , you people eat english , sleep english .
you are english .
oh , then pass the crumpets , old boy .
i' m not kidding around .
anyone not interested in passing that exam can leave right now .
the guy' s been pretty cool .
he called me francis .
hasta luego , placido domingo .
chainsaw , dave , wait a minute .
look , gills is having a cow about our field trips .
unless you guys all pass that test , my job ?
memorex .
anybody got any ideas here ?
get yourself some want ads .
i don' t care what your files say .
you are not that dumb .
actually , mr. shoop , those files are usually right on the money .
you all feel that way ?
i do .
i may as well go home .
mr. shoop ?
look , we don' t want you to lose your job .
think about what you' re asking .
you want us to study ?
the thought did cross my mind .
well , what' s in it for us ?
literacy .
oh , sorry , that' s ...
i' d like to help .
what can i do ?
give me your car .
your house .
and your dog .
see you .
wait , wait !
mr. shoop , wait !
there' s room to negotiate .
what if you granted each one of us one wish ?
what do you mean , " wish " ?
you know , like a favor .
does anybody need anything ?
i need somebody to work out with , in case i get back on the team .
i could use a lamaze coach .
i need some driving lessons .
bad .
ok , there' s two of us .
therefore , we get two .
all right .
one , a party , your house , fourth of july weekend .
in anna maria' s honor .
number two , you arrange a screening , in class , of the greatest movie ever made .
the 1973 tobe hooper classic the texas chainsaw massacre .
that is also in anna maria' s honor .
thank you .
now , then , is there anything that you desire ?
oh , i don' t deserve a wish .
i don' t take the test anyway .
god , she is so honest .
we' il take hers .
chauffeur service for dave and i , every day , to and from work .
pam , what' s your wish ?
i' il tell mr. shoop when the time is right .
larry ?
larry , what do you want ?
bed .
he wants a bed .
as for myself , i just wanna be invited to the party .
we' il see .
good enough .
i think these are fair and reasonable requests .
in return , we' il show up , we' il pay attention and we' il even do a little homework .
is this contract acceptable to labor ?
no doubt .
yeah .
does management agree ?
you sure i' m management ?
for our purposes here , yes .

we got something .
all right .
well , we put that baby to bed .

if i get next door and there' s a candlelight dinner , i' m calling security .
continue .
the 1970 seabed treaty .

this is a natural lull .
interesting phenomenon .
what do you want from me ?
how do you teach ?
if you' re serious , i' il help you .
great .
meet me after school .
we' il make plans for the weekend .
for the weekend ?
big guy .
ok .
the easiest thing to do is base your lesson plans on the students ' own experiences .
i can do that .
your life is probably very similar .
hardly .
i' m telling you , you gotta try these pop tarts .
no , thanks .
i' m sticking with the chocodiles .
the best teachers are the teachers who entertain while they teach .
so you should do just fine .
you think i' m entertaining ?
to children .
i gotta go .
time' s up .
i know why you' re helping me .
professional courtesy .
no .
you like me .
no , i don' t .
yes , you do .
no , i don' t .
yeah , you do .
do not .
do too .
don' t either .
come on .
don' t you like me just a little bit ?
no .
not even that much ?
i like you that much .
it' s a start .
now , someone tell me why learning how to write is so critical .
it' s a form of communication .
amen .
and it can get you free stuff .
free ?
free .
i' m writing the word ... ... free .
here' s how it works .
all of us have been ripped off , right ?
pay phone steals money , not enough cheese on your pizza .
my shades keep falling apart .
perfect .
you' re gonna write that company .
you' il see action , if your letter is clearly written and threatens to hurt their business .
and is signed , forgive me , chainsaw ,
mr. francis gremp , president , consumer against faulty eyewear .
you want me to lie ?
ok .
anyone interested in learning the correct form , please turn to page 46 in your textbook .
the shit works .
damn !
stupid son of a ...
i' m not cut out to be a linebacker .
no , you' re looking at my shoulders .
don' t .
focus on my waist .
ok ?
my waist .
all right , try it again .
go on .
that' s good .
remember , i' m your teacher .
you wanna learn how to surf ?
you sure you wanna do this ?
absolutely .
lamaze class , great place to meet girls .
ok , denise , slide over .
oh , no , no , no .
is this some kind of sick , twisted joke ?
no , i' m combining denise' s driving lesson with your ride to the beach .
we took driver training with denise .
call us a cab .
get your grisly butts in the car .
man , let me drive .
i' m going for my license next week .
chainsaw , you' ve been drinking .
no , it' s cough medicine .
check out this phlegm .
save the phlegm .
you' re not driving anywhere .
i' il tell you something .
you know why so many drunk drivers get in wrecks ?
they don' t learn to drive drunk .
alcohol kills brain cells .
you lose one more , you' re a talking monkey .
come on , get in .
come on .
ok , denise , start her up .
signal left .
pull on out .
can i call my folks and say i won' t be home ... ever ?
i' m not used to this car .
i think it' s safe .
move it out .
nice and smooth .
oh , yeah , that' s ...
fine .
good .
why did you do that ?
a car was coming .
well , it' il happen from time to time .
come on , denise , he won' t bother us .
we just got lapped by an old lady with a walker .
see that space between those cars ?
yeah .
pull in .
parallel park ?
that' s my weak spot .
listen to her .
ok .
i' m sober now .
that' s good for today .

it' s time for dumb and dangerous .

yeah , that' s what i thought .
my body is out of control and it' s big and ugly .
i think you look great .

about five weeks .
it' s gonna be amazing .

i feel so at home here .
yeah , me too .
yeah .
the grunion are running tonight .
in the dead of night , under a full moon , thousands of horny little fish swim hundreds of miles to ball their brains out in the sand .
it' s so romantic .
you ever do that with one of your students ?
no .
i swim hundreds of miles , i' m ready for a nap .
who' s that ?
oh , it' s kim .
she' s sort of my girlfriend .
" sort of " ?
well , she' s in hawaii .
so you' re all alone and you like young girls .
kim' s not that young .
she' s 21 .
i' m 16 .
and you should consider that .
because there' s , like , no difference between 21 and 16 now , but when she' s 66 , i' il only be 61 .
and i' il be 75 and it won' t matter anyway .
yeah .
come on , pam .
time for more fun .
wondermutt !

you' re under arrest for contributing to the delinquency of a minor .
officer , that' s not really my vodka .

yeah .

he' s not really my dog .
he just thinks he' s my dog .
no , he' s a neighborhood dog .
he hangs out at my place because there' s garbage there .
he' s a scavenger .
he' il eat anything .
he' s a beach dog , really .

i got arrested in my swim trunks , so i need 50 bucks and a pair of shoes .
listen , please don' t mention this to that bite in the ass gills .
you' re an angel .
dinner , dancing , paris ...
hello , mr. shoop .
who is this ?
the bite in the ass .
when i say " bite in the ass " , i mean that in the nicest possible way .
can i talk to robin ?
i' m afraid robin and i are on our way out of town .
but don' t worry , we' il be right over .
he' s still a human being , phillip .
we have a very long drive .
if we go downtown now , we' il be stuck in traffic .
and that' s ok with me , we' il be stuck in traffic .
and that' s ok with me , because we' il be helping shoop and you won' t think i' m a shit .
right ?
am i in really big trouble ?
arrested for contributing to the delinquency of minors ?
you' re not a hero .
what is this ?
i made a new friend .
mr. shoop , i do hope we can get you out of this ugly mess .
and it is ugly .
mr. shoop' s been making a lot of progress in his class , phillip .
it' s true .
i' ve been handing out assignments and the kids turn them in .
it' s almost like school in there .
i' ve heard .
and i' m proud .
confirms all my instincts about him .
he' s my boy .
robin , let' s get out of here .
we' re on our way to wine country .
you kids have fun .
see those waves , wondermutt ?
they' re from hawaii .
kim' s in hawaii .
robin' s in the wine country .
you know what we need ?
i mean , besides bread .
we need a woman who will appreciate what we have to offer .
a woman of culture ... ... intellect .
shake those buns , baby !
bring those buns over here .
mama' s got some software for you , baby .
excuse me .
i' m with playgirl magazine .
survey me later , i' m trying to concentrate .
come on , baby .
thanks for your time .
shoot them buns over here .
hey !
hey , cowboy !
don' t i know you ?
hey , back off , hair bag , this is ladies ' night .
i love him , i love him , i love him .
larry !
mr. shoop .
what are you doing here ?
what am i doing here ?
you do this every night ?
well , we have mondays off .
listen , man , you can' t tell anybody , ok ?
they think i' m 21 .
you were fabulous .
this is from both of us .
i' m in the wrong business .
but about school , if you could sneak in a couple hours ' sleep , you' d catch up .
mr. shoop , man , think about what you' re saying .
i mean , if you could be 17 again , only you knew then what you know now .
yeah .
well , i know .
i hate that kid .
who we admire most in the world and why .
the person we admire most in the world is makeup artist
and creature creator rick baker .
his wonderfully gruesome slime bladders and slobber tubes
in american werewolf in london won him a richly deserved oscar .
that is why we admire makeup artist and creature creator rick baker
very , very , very , very , very , very ...
very , very , very , very , very ...
very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very ...
very , very , very , very , very much .
it' s 100 words on the nose .
you can count if you want .
it is not easy to pick the person i admire most .
i admire people for different reasons .
the way they surf or teach english from the heart or help the homeless .
to pick one person is so unfair to everyone else .
isn' t there enough pain in the world ?
since there' s no one i admire most , this is about a person i admire least , my ex boyfriend , andre .
if he tells you he broke up with me , he' s lying , because i told him to get out of my face first .
you know how i could tell when he' s lying ?
his lips move .
i' m serious .
he' s so in love with himself , he ought to be dating a mirror .
he' s in skin tight leather pants , thinking he' s rick james ' little brother .
give the world a break .
denise , can i have your paper ?
no .
no ?
well , i had to memorize my essay due to the fact i was mugged by a gang
looking for money and homework .
that happens .
ok , gang , mark your calendars .
field trip next monday .
where are we going , cockfights ?
courthouse .
your teacher was arrested for giving vodka to some kids .

remember i said i' d tell you my wish when the time was right ?
it' s right .
your wish is to move in with me ?
i' m a great cook .
i won' t get in your way .
you know we connect .
pam , look , my place is very small .
it' s perfect .
look , tommy , that' s my brother , he had another kid and angela , she' s his wife , wants to move the twins back into gail' s room and put sally in the den , so i lose the couch .
yeah , well , my couch is barbecued .
the floor is fine .
mr. shoop , everybody else got their wish .
ok , pam .
if i let you stay here , it' s only temporary until you find another place , ok ?
i can stay .

larry , wake up , you' re missing this .
larry' s not missing a thing .
let him sleep .
there he is .
leatherface , leatherface .

it was great .
what did you think of that ?
god , it was really american .
american , yes .
it' s an american masterpiece .
talk about gutsy endings .
the girl gets away and our hero , leatherface , chainsaws his legs .
two thumbs up .

oh , he won' t care .
i mean , if you don' t mind being my coach .
i wouldn' t mind at all .

see you , eak .
mr. shoop ... ... you should see this , but you can' t let denise know i showed you .
ok ?
ok .
shoop , this girl' s dyslexic .
what ?
that' s not in her file .
this is serious .
you gotta get her some help .
how could she get this far with no one finding out ?
she slipped through the system .
what happens when she gets out in the real world ?
wait !
is this the same guy that took his english class to the petting zoo ?
how' d you get those kids to work ?
bribed them .
what would it take to have dinner with you ?
that would be very expensive .
i' m having dinner with gills .
big phil again , huh ?
robin , be honest , isn' t he a bite in the ass ?
no , he' s not a bite in the ass .
he happens to be very ... ... articulate ... cultured ... ... extraordinarily tidy .
tall , dark and tidy .
that' s a magic combination .
you' re not in love .
none of your business .
sure , it is .
no .
tell me you love him , i' il stop asking you out .
how am i gonna tell you i love him when it' s so new ?
i knew it .
see , robin , he is not the guy for you .
you need an intelligent , sensitive man who can skate .
do you know such a guy ?
oh , they' re hard to find .
but now that i know , i' il keep my eye out .
would you ?
looking good , denise .
good luck .
sir , you are really gonna earn your money today .
francis gremp ?
call me chainsaw .
you' re up next .
can you hold on a sec ?
dad' s late .
he' s so irresponsible .
i said , " dad , 3 : 00 sharp . " but no , it' s just in one ear , out the other .
i need your car .
you wanna use my car ?
i' m under adult supervision .
chainsaw , you take your test and you bring my car right back here to me .
you make me proud to be an american .
dave , kiss this man .
you , come with me .
no , no , you stay there .
i' il bring the car to you .
can you back this up ?
i' m taking a test .
just move all the way back .
what ?
what' d i do ?
don' t worry about me .
see those cars on the right ?
go ahead and park in between .
what do you mean ?
you mean parallel park ?
something wrong ?
no , nothing .
yeah .
we going on the freeway ?
i think we' il just stay in the neighborhood .
why are you driving with only one hand ?
oh , this hand' s gotta be free to put around the babes .
are you marking me off for that ?
watch the dip !
that dip ?
hey , you crazy ?
don' t you ever , ever yell at the driver !
do you hear me ?
where are you going ?
back .
the test is over .
no way !
that was your fault .
this is bullshit .
come on .
i stayed sober for this .
you can' t do this .
come back , you dumb dildo .
wait , no , you' re not a dildo .
i was joking .
that was a joke .
come on , be cool .
one more chance ?
wait .
you lost points for driving too slow and not accepting the right of way .
failed again .
70 is passing .
seventy two .
i passed ?
you passed .
i passed !
oh , i passed !
i passed !
shoop , i passed !
i passed !
i passed !
god , i passed !
thanks !
i' m proud of you .
congratulations .
i couldn' t have done it without you .
now , you drove the car .
look , i owe you one , all right ?
yeah ?
yeah .
ok .
tell you something you can do for me .
what ?
get help with reading .
man .
listen , denise .
what you have is a learning disorder called dyslexia .
you need to retrain your brain to deal with information .
there' s a specialist .
i' m doing fine .
yeah , you are .
but you could be doing so much better .
but that' s up to you .
hey .
think about it , ok ?
ok , free film .
free developing .
come on , what more could you want ?
here .
look , my dad' s a butcher .
you like veal cutlets from minnesota ?
milk fed .
hi , honey , how was your day ?
hectic .
boy , something smells good .
the manicotti .
perfect timing .
why don' t you start on the cheese and crackers .
yeah .
it' s open .
hi .
hey .
i just brought this ray bradbury book .
maybe i should come back later .
why ?
hi , miss bishop .
hi .
oh , robin , pam house , one of my students .
pam , robin bishop .
hi .
hi , pam .
freddy , i didn' t make enough for three .
if you plan on inviting company ,
i wish you' d let me know .
no , he wasn' t .
i stopped by to help him with a lesson .
but we can do that in the morning .
morning' s much better .
i' il make french toast for us .
do you like french toast ?
i bet she makes great french toast .
i actually meant morning at school .
oh , fine .
it was nice to meet you , pam .
you too .
robin ?
i know this is none of my business , but what the hell is going on in there ?
there' s nothing going on in there .
remember those bribes ?
well , pam needed a place to stay .
how long has she been here ?
a couple of days .
my laundry' s never smelled so good .
here , take a whiff .
oh , i' m sure it' s april fresh .
i just hope having a maid is worth the damage you could do to that young girl .
see you tomorrow .
all ready .
great .
french or italian ?
french .
i knew it .
pam , we gotta talk .
sure .
what' s up ?
i think you are a great girl .
and i think you' re a great guy .
god , this is hard .
freddy , go ahead .
you can tell me anything .
ok .
you know how , when you' re on your board , and you see the perfect wave rolling in and you think you got it ?
only , something happens and you don' t get it .
i mean , the key to the whole thing is timing .
if you' re even a little out of sync , you' re grim , you' re blowing the barrel , you' re seaweed .
but then you look outside and you see an even more perfect wave than the first perfect wave and that' s the one you catch .
do you know what i mean ?
yeah .
yeah , i get it .
surfing metaphors .
you' re the perfect wave and i' m seaweed
and if you want me out , just say it .
no , no , i' m not the perfect wave .
and it' s not just that i want you out of my house .
no , you want me out of your life .
pam , look , i' m your teacher .
no .
any time one person lets themself care deeply about another person , that person runs the risk of being rejected and destroyed .
i' il go get my things .
no , wait .
you cooked dinner .
it looks beautiful .
let' s sit down , eat .
it' s just food .
ok .
i' m gonna collect your book reports .
then we are on our way to court .
homework , pam ?
you expect me to relate to the written word after the hell you put me through ?
talk about shallow .
i' ve stepped in deeper puddles .
you' re excused .
mr. shoop , don' t you want mine ?
larry , you' re awake , with homework .
what' s wrong with you ?
i got fired .
they found out my real age .
hey , i didn' t say a word .
no , my mom came to a show .
your mother ?
it was a nightmare .
i mean , before she knew who i was , she put 5 bucks in my g string .
and then my aunt edna , she kisses me .
with tongue .
and rips off my mask .
mom freaked out .
she made me put on her coat .
i' m sorry .
you' re sorry ?
i' m at my sexual peak .
once a guy hits 18 , it' s all downhill .
but it' s a lovely ride .
mr. shoop , why did you tell the arresting officers that the vodka found in the possession of mr. gremp and mr. frazier belonged to you ?
your honor , to keep a couple of students out of trouble .
david and francis have enough problems as it is .
it' s true , your honor .
our lives are a mess .
guys , don' t help .
where did you young men obtain the vodka in question ?
from murray .
who' s murray ?
you know murray .
everybody knows murray .
from murray' s liquor .
didn' t this murray ask to see proof of age ?
well , i come off pretty mature .
did you show him proof of age ?
yeah , i guess i did .
may i see it , please ?
i' d rather you didn' t .
i' d rather i did .
you were a black marine in 1968 ?
vietnam .
a war puts a man through many , many changes .
young man , the possession of false identification and of alcohol by a minor are serious crimes .
you' ve just confessed to both of them .
i didn' t mean to .
however , since the arresting officers
let you off with a warning , i' il probably do the same .
is this guy bitchen or what ?
now , mr. shoop ...
your honor ?
my name is robin elizabeth bishop and i' m also on the faculty with the defendant .
i submit that this man went to jail for his students .
very few teachers ever exhibit that degree of dedication .
therefore , your honor , i move that ...
don' t move , miss bishop .
you' re out of order .
and you' re also correct .
mr. shoop , these charges will be dropped .
case dismissed .
all right !
all right !
that' s so ...
shoop !
let me tell you something .
the judge bought that dedicated teacher crap , but you covered up , thus condoning student drinking .
i am filing a report for kelban with the entire story .
face it .
the test scores won' t save you , because they' re losers , just like you !
hi .
i was just congratulating our good friend mr. shoop .
now , about lunch , sweetheart .
tell you what , sweetheart , why don' t you go ahead , order two lunches and eat them yourself .
one for each face .
ok .
today we take a practice test .
pinpoint each of your weak spots .
then we work a couple hours after school .
wait , wait .
practice tests , extra class time ?
not in the contract .
eakian , get him .
the test is in two weeks .
you need the extra work .
then i' m afraid we' re gonna need some extra incentive .
yeah .
like a party with a band .
i could use some wheels bad .
and get me a job , man , doing strip o grams .
i don' t believe this greed .
believe it , man .
i need a houseboy .
it' s a simple matter of renegotiating our contracts .
renegotiate ?
who do you think you are , teamsters ?
yeah , teamsters !
strike !
strike !
strike !
strike !
look !
for the past four weeks , i have given up all of my free time .
had my body used for a tackling dummy , my house trashed , my couch set on fire , my goldfish murdered , my butt thrown in jail and my car wrecked .
all i' m asking for is a little extra effort .
you know , what' s sad is you guys could all pass that test .
but you' re just so happy being failures that you just don' t know ...
why am i doing this ?
tell you what .
you guys drop out and be illiterate .
i' m going to hawaii and be tan .
have a cow .
damn .
hey .
thanks for the help .
good luck .
where are you going ?
to quit .
you can' t quit .
sure , i can .
i never got through to anybody .
not true .
they were learning .
you' re not a quitter .
i am .
i turned you down for dinner at least a dozen times
and you haven' t quit bugging me .
wanna go out to dinner tonight ?
can' t .
see ?
everybody take a seat .
you , in the cot , out of bed .
where' s mr. shoop ?
he has tendered his resignation .
now , sit down .
would someone tell me what mr. shoop had planned for today ?
yes ?
group sex .
no , that' s tomorrow .
today' s independent study , right after our midmorning nap .
don' t think you can pull this bs with me .
everybody take their textbooks out and turn to chapter seven .
read it again .
who' s making that noise ?
what noise ?
i don' t hear any noise .
what , you got dog ears ?
chainsaw , stop doing that .
stop doing what ?
you know , i hear it too and it' s annoying .
find the hooligan that' s responsible , because i am trying to read chapter seven .
again .
mr. gills , i cannot study .
i' m going to the library .
chainsaw , sit down .
you can hum till your lips fall off , i could care less .
wait a minute .
you' re not dismissed .
now , i promise you , you people act like psychopaths tomorrow
and you will be sorry .
we will be sorry ?
mr. gills sure does know his child psychology .
miss cura , i want to let you know that the children are a little hyperactive , but i' m sure that you' il enjoy their joie de vivre .
so far , i' ve only subbed at grammar schools , so this should be a nice change .
help , mr. gills !
denise !
denise !
take it easy !
what happened ?
don' t go in there without a gun .
it' s terrible .
is this my classroom ?
yes , it is .
whose blood is that ?
is that your blood ?
no .
my god .
we' re back !
what is wrong with you people ?
it' s like you said , gills !
we' re psychopaths !
somebody better call the school nurse !
i am not amused !
turn off those motors !
everybody get up .
now !
i' m not ready for high school .
why' d she leave ?
didn' t she like us ?
where' s her sense of humor ?
i have seen some sick things before .
but this ...
this is ...
devilishly clever .
vomitous !
thank you .
we take a lot of pride in our work .
look , we want shoop back .
why would shoop come back ?
so kelban can fire him ?
he might surprise you .
we did today .
and we' ve got more for tomorrow .
do we have a deal ?
wondermutt , i do not want to play .
not now .
i' m busy .
tough day ?
we' ve been torturing gills .
yeah .
he said you could have your job back .
now , why would i want my job back ?
hey , my life is sailing .
i got a radio , blanket , beach chair , dark glasses , dog .
why would i wanna go back ?
how about we can' t pass that test without you ?
me and chainsaw , we been sober for two days , four hours and 15 minutes .
no kidding ?
swear to god .
reality is so unreal .
but a nice change .
truly .
thumbs up .
i think you should know that you were a phase .
i' ve outgrown you .
but i do wanna be friends , if you can handle it .
and shoop ... ... i' m seeing that reading specialist this afternoon .
look .
we' il study in school , after school , whatever it takes .

i failed .
field trips to the beach , a bed in your classroom , drinking at the beach , a screening of texas chainsaw massacre 1 .
quite a summer , mr. shoop .
i tried to keep it interesting .
i have his dismissal ready for your signature , sir .
before i sign anything ,
i understand there are some people waiting to speak in mr. shoop' s behalf .
really ?
come in .
mr. kelban , you' re not actually going to listen to these delinquents ?
no .
i' m gonna listen to their parents .
i' m principal kelban .
is there a spokesperson here ?
i guess i am .
i' m howard gremp .
you' re chainsaw' s father .
interesting boy .
no , you can say it .
he' s a lunatic .
dad .
you know , six weeks ago , i thought he had the iq of a salad bar .
his only interest in life was to make people sick .
if my mother came to dinner , he would give the dog a third eye or an extra leg .
because of him , we stopped having kids .
i mean , you can imagine the feeling when i saw him studying .
the wife and i almost burst into tears .
david was doing his homework too .
it makes sense , they share the same brain .
not only did mr. shoop get my daughter to read , he taught her to drive .
he showed kevin there' s more to life than just football .
i' m not sure i agree , but it' s possible .
this man should not be teaching .
proof is here in these test results .
look for yourself , mr. shoop .
passing is 70 .
average score here was 63 .
they failed .
that is not true , mr. gills .
we passed ?
no , not all of you .
but that' s not what' s important here .
larry .
went from an 18 to a 51 !
if i' d only seen you strip a week sooner .
you !
mom , my hair .
rhonda .
from a 29 to a 43 and she gave birth .
isn' t childbirth grounds for a makeup test ?
it always has been .
this woman thing never fails .
eakian .
a 51 to a 74 .
i passed !
i am an eakian , grams .
all right , eaker .
denise .
no previous test score because you ditched every test , but a 38 .
honey , that' s terrific .
we' il get them next time .
kevin .
yeah ?
from a 48 to a 75 !
yeah !
i' m back on the team !
yeah !
kill !
yeah !
kill !
chainsaw .
last score was a 6 .
this time , 59 .
monster comeback .
all right .
and dave .
from a 26 to a 70 .
i passed !
you made it !
you passed ?
you passed and i failed , asshole !
how could you do that to me ?
it was an accident .
i' il take it again .
i can fail , i know it .
and pam went from a 53 to an 82 .
was that the highest ?
well , almost .
i mean , that guy who spent six weeks in the bathroom got a 91 .
but look , there' s more going on here than test scores and grades .
you all worked hard and you improved .
and that' s very nice , mr. shoop .
we are here to discuss his flagrant violation of school policies .
hold it , gills .
according to my numbers , the average scores here increased from 28 to 63 .
that' s 125 percent improvement .
now , that' s teaching .
absolutely .
yeah .
mr. shoop , i' m granting you tenure .
he' s back , ladies and gentlemen !
this is the last time i ask .
i promise .
will you have dinner with me ?
i' il think about it .
can i use some of that lip stuff ?
does this mean we can have dinner tonight ?
i didn' t say that .
we' il just talk about it over breakfast . >> napisy pobrane z http : // napisy . org << >>>>>>>> nowa wizja napisw <<<<<<<<
