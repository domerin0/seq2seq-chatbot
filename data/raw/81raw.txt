the primary shareholders will be here for the opening of the bank ... next friday night .
as i have said , the system will not have been tested , and i cannot , in good conscience ...
that party will take place , mrs. phillips , with or without your consent .
this is one of the most complex installs ...
hartmann , don' t tell me how to run my bank .
all right ?
you work for me .
remember ?
now , when i turn around ... both of you will be gone .
and the race is underway . !
lap masters , secure the roadway .
number 16 ...
number 11 , bad chad , is into the pits ...
as we go into turn number one .
hey , retard , i' m losing the race ...
' cause you don' t know what you' re doing !
i can' t believe mom made me hire you as my lead mechanic .
damn . !

you' d better pray this works .
number 11 , bad chad , is finally out of the pits .

chris the clutch pulling tight , giving bad chad reason to worry .

hey , i don' t know if you heard ... but bad chad picked up a shift at your mama' s bank .
i' il be working with lieutenant ferrell in security .
one step closer to being a cop .
don' t worry .
ferrell won' t let bad chad carry a weapon .
he' s an intern !
trainee , butt munch !
sorry .

hi , dad .
hey , kiddo .
what' s up ?
mom needs me to pick up max from day care again .
it won' t be forever , sweetie .
all right , now you sound like mom .
that' s so terrible ?
you okay ?
is this a new style that the kids are sporting ?
dad , don' t freak out .
when do i ever freak out , madeline ?
it' s just that there are a thousand other sports ...
that don' t involve falling a hundred feet to your death .
dad , you said standing on top of mount everest was the best day of your life .
no , i said it was one of the best days of my life .
look .
see , i even wore the hat you gave me .
i just don' t understand what the problem is with me trying to be like you .
do we have to discuss this every day ?
just till i turn 18 .
okay , race fans , here we are .
the last race of the day !
drivers , get in position .
hey , mr. p , can i ask you a very serious question ?
only if you want a very serious answer .
do ladies like guys who build stuff with their hands ?
or do they go for the nerds who play computer games and stuff ?
yo , what he means is ... do women prefer a low i. q. ?
ber male ... who only knows stuff about spark plugs ... or do they prefer a true artist ... who has both sensitivity and a brain ?
that' s a very difficult question , boys ... but i' m afraid i' m not the one to ask .
hey , madeline rose ...
no , no , no , no , no !
dad , don' t call me that .
what are you doing ?
nothing .
nothing .
nothing .
ow , ow , ow !
ow !
aah !
aah !
ow , ow , ow , ow , ow , ow !
it' s an old climber' s trick .
dude , you' re gonna have a scar .
why do you get all the cool stuff ?
it' s true .
women love scars .
this drives maddy' s mom crazy .
check it out .
whoa !
that' s gross !
you can touch it if you want .
is that from when you fell ?
yep .
hundred foot free fall .
okay , okay .
okay .
stop touching .
bad touch .
okay .
hey , stranger .
not you too .
now , this ... is a nutritious dinner .
please .
don' t give me a hard time .
we just miss you .
especially maddy .
and i don' t wanna have to set my alarm for the middle of the night ... just so i can have a date with my wife .
would you like to go dancing ?
i have to go back to work .
i can' t ...
i really ...
you have to do this first , okay ?
tom , come on .
quit messing around .
i can' t hold you up .
i can' t ...
tom ?
what' s going on ?
i can' t feel my legs .
what ...
where does it hurt ?
tom ?
can you hear me ?
tom ?
tom . !
the injury probably occurred during his climbing accident .
there must be something you can do .
i mean , isn' t there any kind of emergency surgery or anything ?
there' s nothing we can do here .
there is a private medical facility in denmark that has done testing on this injury .
okay , then let' s go , then .
it' s considered experimental .
even though it' s been highly successful ...
we' il try anything .
your insurance won' t cover it .
how much ?
what ?
how much does the surgery cost ?
we' il pay for it .
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars .
okay , w we' il pay it .
mom , tell ...
mom , tell her we' il pay it .
mom , we ... we can ... we can pay it .
mom , tell her we' il pay it .
please .
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ?
please tell her we' il pay it .
what happens if your dad doesn' t get the operation ?
we' il go door to door .
everyone loves your dad .
they' il give us money .
i could sell my camera .
it' s $250, 000, you guys .
you know how much money that is ?
i have a coin collection .
they' re rare .
r ...
well , what if i ... what if i borrow half ?
and then i can make ...
no , it doesn' t exceed that .
personal collateral ?
uh , we own a go cart track .
let' s cut to the chase , shall we , mrs. phillips ?
you' re not qualified for a personal loan of this size .
i understand , but , uh , my husband is sick and i was hoping ...
yes .
yes , i' m aware of that , mrs. phillips .
doesn' t it mean anything that i work for the bank ?
but you' re freelance , aren' t you ?
mm hmm .
from a security company .
a security company which , under your guidance ... has been unable to provide my bank ... with a fully operational security system in the allotted time ... stated in the contract .
come on .
come on , sweetie .
don' t you have a heart ?
this is not an emotional issue , mrs. phillips .
a bank has no heart .
only paper in a vault .
strange not being able to move .
i' ve been staring at the same spot on the ceiling for the past three hours .
mom can' t come up with the money , dad .
i escaped death on that climb , maddy .
twenty feet from the summit , my gear stuck ... but there was this perfect crack all the way up to the top .
you free climbed it ?
it was so easy , i lost concentration and i fell .
but somebody or something was looking out for me so i could go home ... see you , get to know what a great girl you are .
in a way , that fall was the best thing that could' ve happened to me .
you know i' d do anything for you .
dad , we' il come up with the money .
i promise .
and lined it with a 200 foot high steel chamber ... which houses the lion safe .
the system combines the best of new technology ... and old tried and true security methods ... making harderbach financial the most secure a bank can be .
the entire system is run on a tri motor generator ... making power loss a virtual impossibility ... meaning the system will remain safe even in the event of a citywide blackout .
the project began in the fall of 2000 ... and is the largest , most technologically advanced security install to date ... for any bank in north america .
the halls are lined with hundreds of motion sensitive cameras ... whose images are fed back to a state of the art security booth .
until the system has been fully tested ... the halls will be patrolled after hours by highly trained attack dogs .
this all leads to the lion safe .
the safe is suspended nearly 100 feet off the ground ... and is equipped to hold over $25 million in cash and gold bullion .
safety deposit boxes line the walls of this chamber .
slated to be finished in april of 2004 ...
are you crazy ?
we can' t rob a bank .
we' il pay them back .
how ?
i don' t know .
i' il work .
i' il do anything .
you understand what happens if we get caught , right ?
we go to jail forever .
like , until we' re 21 .
no one will ever suspect us .
adults treat us like we' re five years old anyway .
how hard could it be ?
tomorrow i' il go to work with my mom and check out the bank .
meanwhile , gus , you need to find out who the architect is of the bank ... and see if you can get a floor plan or a model .
and austin ...
austin' il take care of the dogs .
what dogs ?
the rottweilers .
vicious killing dogs .
gus , come on .
this is serious .
tomorrow , at the bank , i' il try to check out my mom' s security system .
good morning .
who' s in the car with you today ?
my daughter .
i' il take as many pictures as i can .
you guys , i really need you .
all right .
for mr. p.
for your dad .
okay , maddy , here we go .
maddy ?
do you have any idea how fast you were goin ' ?
save it , pal .
license and registration .
that ... is the eye of god , chad .
do you see these people ?
these are not people .
these are snakes in paradise , waiting for your weakest moment ... any chance you give them .
these people ?
not to be trusted .
oh . !
my sweethearts .
maddy , i love that you wanted to come to work with me today , sweetheart ... but i have a lot of work to do , so i need you to keep up .
can i see the safe ?
that' s just the old safe .
the real one' s upstairs .
what are those ?
that' s a motion detector .
can i see the new safe ?
and if miss fancy pants phillips would have listened to me ... we wouldn' t need all this high tech flim flammery .
the dogs ...
the dogs would have done all the work .
the dogs and my black belt , that is .
aaah !
back to the monitor , maggot !
your office is upstairs ?
yeah .
i need to be near the safe .
whoa .
that thing looks like it' s alive .
it' s got a built in motion detector ...
the guards can' t watch all 100 cameras at the same time ... so when the camera picks up movement , the light goes on and they can see us .
watch .
just stay completely still .
ah .
climber girl .
that' s pretty cool .
they' d better fix the i. s. p. , because that whole side of the building is s. o. l.
molly ?
oh .
i didn' t think you were coming in today .
the party is friday , so i wanted to make sure the system is as close as possible .
yeah .
listen , i spoke with brisbane about the loan , and he just wouldn' t budge .
i' m really sorry .
oh , god .

i got this dog for my birthday , and i was hoping i could use him as a stunt dog ...
what kind of dog do you have ?
a budweiser ?
rottweiler ?
yeah .
i just happen to be a rottweiler expert .
there is a really nice boy here ... who' s going to write an essay about the design of the ...
harderbach financial building ... and he needs a floor plan drawing that he can use ... as a visual aid for his essay .
are you freakin ' nuts ?
you can' t give bank floor plans to a kid !
you' re just ...
normally he' s very nice .
but it' s a little more difficult with banks .
i mean , imagine if you were a bank robber ...
it' s just that last time i got a " c " on my essay ... because i didn' t have any visual aids .
and my stepdad , he ...
well , he gets a little ...
oh !
just stay here .
you can' t see it now , but by the party we are hoping it' s primo .
down here is the security room ... ultra high tech and cool .
your mom designed that too .
notice the key pads , which are designed to keep people out of the important areas of the bank .
who has the codes to all these ?
oh , they' re different from room to room .
but i have a code that is good for the whole building .
cool .
come on .
d e n i r o.

haah . !
ooh .
in this room there' s a tunnel that leads to the safe .

only your mom understands the whole thing .
after all , she designed it .
oh !

my god !
i can' t wait until we get rid of these things .
they get me every time .

shh . !
rottweilers respond to german commands only !

you were really good today , austin .

i just try to stay out of the way of my actors and let the magic happen .
gus , what are you doing ?
we have to go over the plan .
go over the plan with your boyfriend .
what are you talking about ?
he' s not my boyfriend .
oh , so you' d rather go out with gus .
i never said that ...
are all boys this stupid ?
i don' t wanna go out with either of you !
if we' re so stupid , then why don' t you just rob the bank yourself ?
fine !
i will !
good luck rigging your go cart .
yeah , and have a good time hacking into the bank' s computer by yourself .
this whole bank idea sucks !
dad , i have to talk to you .
i' m gonna steal $250, 000 from mom' s bank .
i have to climb a hundred feet to get to the safe .
way higher than i' ve ever , ever climbed before .
and i have to lie to my two best friends to get ' em to do it with me .
well , maddy ... a hundred feet is too dangerous .
you know , that' s how far i fell .
yeah , i know , dad .
plus , it' s illegal to steal money .
you know mom' il get fired if anyone ever found out .
i thought about all that , but ... but wouldn' t it be worth it if it means you could get better ?
yeah , maddy ... it probably would be .
i' ve been thinking since yesterday , and ...
i love you .
here .
um , i have the other half .
please say all that again .
stop .
come on .
promise to help with the mission ?
yeah .
just don' t tell gus , ' cause we need him , and he wouldn' t do it if he knew .
he' d be devastated .
what about austin ?
you' re much cuter .
i' ve actually liked you the whole time .
yes !
i knew it !
uh , here .
i have the other half .
promise to help with the mission ?
okay .
cool .
okay , guys , let' s go over the plan one last time .
so , i took maddy' s pictures from the bank , the model that gus brought home ... and i scanned them into the computer .
using those elements , i created a digital blueprint of the building .
check it out .
voil ?
whoa !
that is awesome !
i mean , it' s okay ... if you like that kind of stuff .
wow .
here' s where the party' s gonna be .
it' il be mostly contained in the lobby of the bank .
it' s gonna be pretty fancy , so we' re gonna need to blend in .
security' s on the second floor , so we' il have to get past your brother and ferrell ... to get to the elevator that accesses the ninth floor where the safe is .
okay , and austin , you' il hack into the bank' s camera system from brisbane' s office .
gus , were gonna make our way to the safe .
it' s suspended a hundred feet off the ground ... so the only way to get to it is to climb .
wow .
maddy , are you sure you' re gonna be able to make this climb ?
i mean , it' s double the size of the water tower .
you guys take care of your jobs .
i' il take care of mine .
they' re gonna be doing a lot of tests on your father tonight at the hospital ... so i wanna be there for that .
i' m gonna need you to look after max while i' m gone .
mom , i can' t .
i' m going out with gus and austin .
you never think about me .
if you' re not gonna come to the hospital , then you' re ...
mom , i can' t , i ...
maddy .
you' re gonna babysit max tonight .
okay ?
that' s it .
oh , one more thing .
i do think about you , madeline .
every day .
all the time .
nice bandana .
nice turtleneck .
what' s he doing here ?
i have to babysit him .
but he' s gonna completely ruin everything we just worked for .
he hasn' t made a sound his whole life .
i don' t think he' s gonna start now .
what if we mess up ?
we' re my dad' s only chance .
i' m ready .
you ready ?
let' s hit it .
ooh !
gross !
mom , bart was taking a picture of his butt !
like i' m really gonna take a picture of my butt .
stop it , you two .
since it' s just the four of us tonight , we' re having dinner ...
at the rusty barnacle .
yay !
grab a burger and ...
only four of us ?
who escaped ?
you know , that part ?
i was really , really proud of it .
aren' t those marvelous ?
please let me show you .
these are really quite extraordinary .
the lighting , in particular ...
well , you know ...
the , uh , uh ...
it' s all clear .
here you go , maddy .
okay , when i get up there ...
i' il try to disable the motion sensors so you guys can just come up the stairs .
careful , maddy .
maddy !
camera !
careful .
i gotta get chad and ferrell out of that security booth .
don' t worry .
we got it covered .
and strike , and strike , like a cobra !
aaah . !
haah !

oh !
lieuten ...
ohh !
lesson one , chad .
never take your eyes off the enemy .
take this for a test drive .
dude , the way your feet smell , it' s just ... it' s not normal .
whoo !
god , gus !
oh , my god .
gotcha .
what' s that ?
motion detected , north staircase .
check the monitors .
check the monitors !
i don' t see anything .
that' s when your enemy is their most dangerous ... when you can' t see them .
this is a test .
i just know it .
i' il go downstairs , make a round .
you stay here ... and take care of your ... privates .
you stay in this booth !
okay , it worked .
well , sort of ...
ferrell' s gone .
but now bad chad' s alone in the security booth .
just hold on .
we' il think of something .
i got it .
i' m gonna distract him .
when i give the signal , get into the elevator .
i' il meet you there .
hey , maddy , what' s the signal ?
maddy !
get away from chad !
he' s a lunatic !
my brother' s crazy .
he really thinks he' s a cop .
this wasn' t part of the plan .
maddy , don' t go in there . !
hi .
what are you doing here ?
i was at the party .
i was totally bored .
what are you doing ?

you look different .
why are you such a jerk to your brother all the time ?

well , which one ?
there' s a big difference .
yao ming .
definitely shaq .

yeah , i think so .
sweet .
he thinks you' re gonna be a great cop .
he told me .
come downstairs with me .
the police chief is here to check on mom' s security system .
you could show him how serious you are about yourjob .
ferrell told me not to leave the booth , but ...
i just came from the party .
don' t worry .
he' s not down there .
she winked at me .
so gus really thinks i' m cool ?
yeah .
maybe that' s the signal .

backup requested .
harderbach robbery suspects on the loose .
alan !
i just heard .
how much did they get away with ?
who' s this ?
uh , she' s the head of security .
three suspects .
they got away on go carts .
they hit you for $250, 000 .
go carts ?
yeah .
we also found this in the vault room .
they used it to climb up to the safe .
do you have the perpetrators in custody ?
not yet .
what i want to know is , why would someone break into a safe with $25 million ... and steal only $250, 000 ?
excuse me !
there she is !
she' s our so called head of security .
this is all her fault !
actually , mr. brisbane , i did ...
uh , mr. brisbane , with all due respect ...
molly did tell you that the security system had not been tested .
really ?
well , you just got your walking papers .
didn' t you , hartmann ?
are you talkin ' to me ?
are you talkin ' to me ?
well , you must be talkin ' to me , ' cause there' s nobody else here .
so you must be talkin ' to me !
excuse me .
monsieur nuffaut , i must apologize ... for this strange debacle .
i assure you ...
it' s not me you owe an apology to , brisbane .
if the head of security told you ... the system is not ready , then it seems like a ... how do you say ... a knucklehead move to go ahead with this soiree .
je suis d ?
sol ?
madame .
the blame falls squarely on your shoulders .
on y va , ch ?
rie .
monsieur nuffaut !
oh , fran ?
ois !
couldn' t stay away , huh ?
let' s go save your dad .
maddy , what are you doing ?
i have the money for the operation , dad .
we' re goin ' to denmark .
what are you talking about ?
i got the money !
honey .
what have you done ?
maddy , we gotta go !
what are you doing ?
madeline , what ...
mom , i have ...
i have the money .
we can go .
molly , what is ... what is this ?
i warned him ... that the system wasn' t online yet .
i know .
and to prove to everyone ... just how vulnerable the bank was ...
i had my daughter and her two friends ... three kids ... rob the bank .
and i think if you look in my contract , you will see ... that i have a license to perform undisclosed tests to the system ... until such date as the system is deemed fully operable .
are you buying any of this ?
yeah .
molly was authorized to hire consultants ... to test the system .
this was all a plan ... a brilliant plan .
all right .
could you step back , please ?
mrs. phillips ...
mrs. phillips , is it true ... your daughter is a leading suspect in the robbery ?
sir ?
mrs. phillips , please ?
ready ?
we understand three children were involved in the high speed pursuit ... ending up here at community wide hospital .
details are sketchy , but it appears the children ... have robbed harderbach financial of nearly a quarter million ...
and a source inside the bank is saying the robbery ... was actually some type of plot to test the bank' s security ...
now , stories are swirling , but this reporter has learned ... that one of the children has a father in desperate need of an operation .
the child has not been identified ... but her father is registered in the hospital as tom phillips .
now , mr. phillips runs a local go cart track , and is expected to return home tomorrow ...
since insurance will not cover his operation .
maddy ?
i' m maria quiban , channel 10 news .
you know what you did was wrong .
yeah , i know .
and i know i haven' t really been there for you .
but that' s gonna change .
okay ?
i love you .
i love you too , maddy .
you have such a big heart .
you guys gotta come down the track .
you' re not gonna believe this .
they' re coming .
what are they doing ?
waiting to buy tickets .

how much ?
400 .
i have 300 .
here' s two here .
wait .
plus ...
well ?
even with the donations from the news station , we' re still short .
molly ?
mr. hartmann .
you forgot something ... the consultant fee for the company you hired to pull off the robbery .
holy ... $50, 000 ?
ah .
the hair .
the hair .
well , that should get you pretty close .
and the president of the bank has authorized any personal loan to cover the difference .
mr. brisbane already said that ...
i' m afraid he' s not with the bank anymore , so call me for whatever you need .
thank you so much .
you' re welcome .
i finally got my starring role .
$50, 000 !
