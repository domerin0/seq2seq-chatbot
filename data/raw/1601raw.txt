help !
hey !
help !
do something !
what ?
anything !
hurry up !
switch and flick !
cool .
is it dead ?
i don' t think so , just knocked out .
trog boggies .
my goodness .
explain yourselves !
both of you !
it' s my fault , professor mcgonagall .
mrs. granger ?
i was looking for the troll , i ' ve read about them .
i thought i can handle it .
but i was wrong .
if harry and ron haven' t come and found me ,
i' d probably be dead .
it was an extremely foolish thing to do .
i' il expect more rational behaviour on you .
you disappointed me , ms. granger .
five points will be taken from griffindor for your serious lack of judgement .
as for you two , i hope you realize how fortunate you are .
not many first year students could take down a fully grown trog
and live it till the day off .
five points ... will be awarded to each of you .
for shared dump luck .
you better go .
it might wake up .
don' t worry harry
you' re gonna need your strength today
good luck today potter
another game of proving yourself will be easy work for you
even if it' s against slytherin
blood ?
iisten last night i' m guessing snape' s diversion
so he' d get past out of the dog
but he got himself bitten
that' s why he' s limping
why' d anyone go near that dog ?
the day i and hagrid took something out of the vault
he said it was hogwarts business
very secret
so you' re saying ...
that' s what the dog' s guarding
that' s what snape wants
i' d never get my own
iet' s open it
it' s a broom stick
that' s not just a broom stick
it' s the nimbus 2000
you' re scared harry ?
a little
i felt the same way before my first game
what happened ?
i don' t really remember
i took a badge to the head
woke up in hospital a week later
welcome to hogwarts first game of the season
today' s game
slyterin versus griffindor
the players take their positions on the field to begin the game
now i want a nice clean game
from all of you
remember the snitch is 150 points
the seeker who catches the snitch ends the game
and the game begins
10 points for griffindor
well done
slytherin takes position
another 10 points to griffindor
what' s going on with harry ' s broom stick
it' s snape
he' s jinxing the broom
jinxing the broom ?
what do we do ?
ieave it to me
you' re on fire
iooks like he' s gonna be sick
he' s got the snitch
harry potter received 150 points
griffindor wins
nonsense
why' s snape put a curse in harry' s broom
who knows
why' d he pass the 3 headed dog at halloween ?
who told you about fluffy ?
that thing has a name ?
of course he got a name he is mine
i bought him last year
then i let him at dumbledore to guard the ...
don' t ask anymore questions
as a top secret that is
but whatever fluffy' s guarding snape is trying to steal it
professor snape is a howarts teacher
hogwarts teacher or not i know a spell when i see one
you got to keep eye contact
and snape wasn' t blinking
exactly
all 3 of you listen to me
you' re mad and things aren' t to be meddled in
it' s dangerous
while our dog' s guarding
it' s strictly between professor dumbledore and nicholas flamel
nicholas flamel ?
i shouldn' t have said that
who' s nicholas flamel ?
knight to e 5
queen to e 5
that' s totally barbaric
that' s a wizard chess
i see you' ve packed
i see you haven' t
a change of plans
my parents decided to go to romania
to visit my brother charlie
he' s studying the dragons there
he' s going to look into a library for information on nicholas flamel
we' ve looked 100 times
not in the restricted section
happy christmas
i think we have a bad influence on her
harry wake up
happy christmas harry
happy christmas ron
what' re you wearing ?
my mum made it
iooks like you got one too
i' ve got presents
here they' re
your father left this in my possession before he died .
it' s time it was returned to you .
use it well .
what' s it ?
some kinda coat .
iet' s see it put it on
my body' s gone .
i know what that is .
that' s an invisibility coat .
i' m invisible
they' re really rare .
why did he give it to you ?
there' s no name
it just says use it well
nicholas flamel where are you ?
who' s it ?
who' s it ?
show yourself
silence .
i ...
you don' t want me as your enemy , quirrell .
what do you mean ?
you know perfectly what i mean .
we' il have another little chat soon .
when you have time to decide where your loyalties lie .
professors .
i found this in a restricted area section .
it' s still hot .
that means there' s student still out of bed .
mom ?
dad ?
ron , you really got to see this !
you got to see this !
ron , come on .
get out of bed !
why ?
there' s something you' ve got to see , come on !
come on , look at my parents !
i only see us .
look in properly .
stand there .
there , you see them , don' t you ?
that' s me !
i' m the head boy !
i got a hold on the quidditch cup !
and bloody hell !
i' m quidditch captain too !
i look good .
harry , do you think this mirror shows the future ?
how can it ?
both my parents are dead .
back again , harry ?
i see that you , like so many before you have discovered the delights of the mirror of araset .
i trust by now you realize what it does .
let me give you a clue .
the happiest man on earth would look into the mirror
and see only himself , exactly as he is .
so then , it shows us what we want .
whatever we want .
yes .
and no .
it shows us nothing more or less
than the deepest and most desperate desires of our heart .
now you , harry , would never know your family .
you see them standing beside you .
but remember this , harry ,
this mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth .
men have wasted away in front of it .
even gone mad .
that' s why tomorrow it' il be moved to a new home .
and i must ask you
not to go looking for it again .
it doesn' t good to dwell on dreams ,
harry , and forget to live .
i had you looking in the wrong section .
how could i be so stupid !
i checked out weeks ago for better light reading .
this is light ?
of course !
here it is .
nicholas flamel is the only known maker of the sorcerer' s stone .
what ?
honestly , don' t you two read ?
the sorcerer' s stone is a legendary substance
with astonishing power .
it enchants from any metal into pure gold , and produces extra life .
which will make one immortal .
immortal ?
it means you' il never die .
i know what it means !
and the only stone currently in existence belongs to
mr. nicholas flamel ,
who last year celebrated his 665 birthday .
that' s what fluffy guards on the third floor .
that' s what under the trapdoor .
the sorcerer' s stone .
hagrid .
hello .
sorry , don' t wish to be rude , but no time to entertain you today .
we know about the sorcerer' s stone .
we think snape is trying to steal it .
snape ?
blind me , you still don' t like him .
hagrid , we know he' s after the stone , we just don' t know why .
snape is one of the teachers protecting the stone .
he' s not able to steal it .
what ?
you heard it .
come on , i' m a bit preoccupied today .
wait a minute .
one of the teachers ?
of course !
there' re others things defending the stone , aren' t there ?
spells , enchantments .
that' s right .
waste your bloody time to ask me .
no one is gonna get passed fluffy .
no one knows how .
except for me and dumbledore .
i should not have told you that .
hagrid , what exactly is that ?
that' s a ...
it' s a ...
i know what that is .
but hagrid , how did you get one ?
i won it from a stranger i met in a pub .
he seems glad to get rid of it , as a matter of fact .
is that ...
a dragon ?
that' s not just a dragon .
it' s novigem witch bat .
my brother charlie works on this in romania .
it' s so beautiful .
bless me .
look , it knows mummy .
hello , norbert .
norbert ?
he gotta have a name , doesn' t he ?
don' t you , norbert ?
he needs to be trained up a little bit , of course .
who' s that ?
malfoy .
oh dear .
hagrid always wanted to have a dragon .
he told me so when i first met him .
it' s crazy .
worse , malfoy knows .
i don' t understand , is that bad ?
it' s bad .
good evening .
nothing , i repeat , nothing gives a student the right to walk around school at night .
therefore the punishment for your actions , 50 points will be taken .
50 ?
each .
and to ensure it doesn' t happen again , all four of you will receive detention .
excuse me , professor .
perhaps i heard it wrong .
i heard you said the " four " of us .
no , you heard me correctly , mr. malfoy .
although your honorable intentions , you too were out of bed after hours .
you' il join your classmates in detention .
a pity that they let the old punishment die .
it was a time detention was made by hanging around in the dungeons .
god , i' il miss the screaming .
you' il be serving detention with hagrid tonight .
he' s got a little job to do inside the dark forest .
sorry that you' ve lost it , hagrid .
good god , you' re noy still on the bad for that bloody dragon , are you ?
nobert is gone .
dumbledore sent him off to romania .
living in colony .
well that' s good , isn' t it ?
he' il be with his own kind .
yea , but what if he don' t like romania ?
what if the other dragons are mean to him ?
he' s only a baby after all .
for god sake , pull yourself together , man .
you' re going into the forest .
things that you work about .
the forest ?
i thought that was a joke .
we can' t go in there .
students aren' t allowed .
and there' re ...
warewolves !
there' s more than warewolves in that strange land .
you can be sure of that .
nighty night .
right .
let' s go .
hagrid , what is that ?
what we are here for .
see that ?
that' s unicorn' s blood .
i found one dead a few weeks ago .
there , and this one has been hurt bad by someone .
so it' s our job to go and find the poor beast .
ron , hermione , you come with me .
okay .
harry , you go with malfoy .
okay , then i get fang .
fine , just so you know , he' s a bloody coward .
you bet my father heard about this .
this is servant stuff !
if i didn' t know better , draco , i think you were scared .
scared , potter ?
did you hear that ?
come on , fang .
what is it , fang ?
harry potter , you must leave .
you' re known to many creatures here .
the forest is not safe in this time .
especially for you .
but what was that thing you saved me from ?
a monstrous creature .
it' s a terrible crime to slay a unicorn .
drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive
even you' re an inch from death .
but at a terrible price .
if you slay something so pure ,
from the moment the blood touches your lips , you' il have a half life .
a cursed life .
what thing will choose such a life ?
can you think of no one ?
do you mean to say ,
that thing that killed unicorn , that was drinking its blood ,
that was voldemort ?
do you know what is heading to the school at this very moment , mr. potter ?
the sorcerer' s stone .
harry !
hello there , firanze .
seen you' ve met our young mr. potter .
you all right there , harry ?
harry potter , this is where i leave you .
you' re safe now .
good luck .
you mean you know who' s out there in the forest ?
but he' s weak .
he' s living by unicorns .
don' t you see ?
we had it wrong .
snape doesn' t want the stone for himself .
he wants the stone for voldemort .
with the extra life , voldemort will be strong again .
he' il come back .
if he comes back , you don' t think he' il try to kill you , do you ?
i think if he got the chance , he might try to kill me tonight .
and i' m worried about my potion' s final .
wait a minute .
we' re forgetting one thing .
who' s the one wizard voldemort always feared ?
dumbledore .
as long as dumbledore is around , harry , you' re safe .
as long as dumbledore is around , you can' t be touched .
i always had hogwarts ' center year exam were frightful .
but i find that rather enjoyable .
speak for yourself .
what , harry ?
my scar .
it keeps burning .
it happened before .
not like this .
perhaps you should see the nurse .
i think it' s a warning .
it means danger' s coming .
of course .
what is it ?
don' t you think it' s a bit odd ?
what hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon .
and the stranger turns up , he just happens to have one ?
i mean , how many people wandering around
with dragon egg in their pocket ?
why didn' t i see it before ?
hagrid , who gave you the dragon egg ?
what did he look like ?
i don' t know , i never saw his face .
he kept his hood up .
this stranger though , you and him must have talked .
he wanted to know what sort of creatures i look after .
i told him that after fluffy a dragon is gonna be no problem .
did he interested in fluffy ?
of course he' s interested in fluffy .
how often you come across a 3 headed dog even if you' re in the trade ?
but i told him , i said , trade was any beast do no hold a comment .
take fluffy for example .
just play him some music , and he' il fall straight asleep .
i shouldn' t have told you that .
where' re you going ?
we have to see professor dumbledore .
immediately .
i' m afraid professor dumbledore is not here .
he received an urgent outlook from the ministry of magic
and left immediately for london .
he' s gone ?
but this is important .
it' s about the sorcerer' s stone .
how do you know ...
someone is going to try and steal it .
i don' t know how you three found out about the stone ,
but i assure you it' s perfectly well protected .
now would you go back to your dormitories .
quietly .
that was not a stranger out in the middle .
it was snape , which means he knows how to get passed fluffy .
and with dumbledore gone .
good afternoon .
what would 3 young griffindors
such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this ?
we were just ...
be careful .
people will think you' re ... ... up to something .
now what do we do ?
we' re going to the trapdoor .
tonight .
trival .
trival , go .
you shouldn' t be here .
neither should you .
you' re sneaking out again , aren' t you ?
no , neville listen .
no , i won' t let you !
you' il get griffindor in trouble again .
i' il fight you .
neville , i' m really sorry about this .
you' re a little scary sometimes .
you know that .
brilliant , but scary .
let' s go .
sorry .
it' s for your own good .
you stepped my foot .
sorry .
wait a minute .
it' s snoring .
snape' s already been here .
he' s put a spell on the harp .
it' s got horrible breathe .
we have to move its paws .
what ?
come on !
okay , push .
i' il go first .
don' t follow until i give you a sign .
if something bad happens , get yourselves out .
does this seem a bit quiet here ?
the harp , it stopped playing .
jump !
luckily this plant is here .
stop moving .
dulfuty is a devil snare .
you have to relax .
if you don' t , it' il only kill you faster .
kill us faster ?
now i can relax !
hermione !
what are we gonna do ?
just relax !
hermione , where are you ?
do what i say !
trust me !
harry !
are you okay ?
yeah , i' m fine .
help !
he' s not relaxing , is he ?
apparently not .
we gotta do something .
what ?
i remember reading something in herbology .
devil snare , devil snare , it' s deadly fun but broken when sun .
that' s it !
devil snare hates sunlight .
are you okay ?
yeah .
luckily we didn' t panic .
luckily hermione pays attention in herbology .
what is that ?
i don' t know .
sounds like wings .
curious , i' ve never seen birds like these .
they' re not birds , they' re keys .
and i bet one of them fits that door .
what' s this all about ?
i don' t know .
strange .
well , it worthed a try .
what are we going to do ?
there must be a thousand keys out there .
we' re looking for a big old fashioned one .
probably rusty on the handle .
there , i see it .
flew with a broken wing .
what' s wrong , harry ?
it' s too simple .
go on , harry .
if snape can catch on that broom stick , you can .
you' re the youngest seeker in a century .
this complicates things a bit .
catch the key !
hurry up !
i don' t like this .
i don' t like this at all .
where are we ?
graveyard ?
this is no graveyard .
it' s a chessboard .
that' s the door .
now what do we do ?
it' s obvious , isn' t it ?
we gotta play our way across the room .
all right , harry , you take the empty square .
hermione , you' il be the queen beside the castle .
as for me , i' il be a knight .
what happens now ?
well , white moves first , and then ...
we play .
ron , you don' t supposed this is going to be like ...
real wizard chess , do you ?
you there , d5 !
yes , hermione .
i think this is gonna be exactly like a wizard chess .
castle to e4 !
to c3 !
wait a minute .
you understand why , harry .
once i make my move , the queen will take me .
then you' re free to check the king .
no , ron , no !
what is it ?
he' s going to sacrifice himself !
no , you can' t !
there must be another way !
do you want to stop snape from getting that stone or not ?
harry , it' s you who has to go on !
not me , not hermione .
you .
knight to h3 .
check .
ron !
no , don' t move !
don' t forget , we' re still playing .
checkmate .
take care of ron .
then go out of here .
send the message to dumbledore .
ron' s right .
i have to go on .
you' il be okay , harry .
you' re great wizard .
you really are .
not as good as you .
me ?
books and cleverness .
there' re more important things .
friendship and bravery .
now , harry , just be careful .
you ?
no , it can' t be .
snape , he was ...
he does seem the type , doesn' t he ?
next to him , who will suspect poor stuttering professor quirrell ?
but that day , during the quidditch match , snape tried to kill me .
no , dear boy , i tried to kill you .
and trust me , if snape didn' t caught fire and broke my eye contact ,
i would have succeeded .
even with snape muttering his little curse .
snape was trying to save me ?
i knew you' re danger to me right from the off .
especially after halloween .
then you let the trog in ?
very good potter , yes .
snape unfortunately wasn' t fooled .
when everybody else was running to the dungeon ,
he runned to the third floor and hit me off .
he , of course , never trusted me again .
he better left me alone .
but he doesn' t understand .
i' m never alone .
never .
now , what does this mirror do ?
i see what i desire .
i see myself holding the stone .
but how do i get it ?
use the boy .
come here , potter !
now !
tell me , what do you see ?
what is it , what do you see ?
i' m shaking hands with dumbledore .
i' ve won the house cup .
he lies .
tell the truth !
what do you see ?
let me speak to him .
master , you' re not strong enough .
i' ve strength enough for this .
harry potter , we meet again .
voldemort ?
yes , you see what i' ve become .
see what i must do to survive .
live on another human' s back side unicorn' s blood can sustain me .
but it cannot give me a body of my own .
but there' s something that can .
something that strong enough lies in your pocket .
stop him !
don' t be a fool .
why suffer in death when you can join me and live ?
never !
bravery .
your parents had it too .
tell me , harry ,
would you like to see your mother and father again ?
together , we can bring them back .
all i ask is for something in return .
that' s it , harry .
there' s no good and evil .
there' s only power .
and those too weak to seek it .
together , we' il do extraordinary things .
just give me the stone .
you liar !
get him !
what is this magic ?
get the stone !
good afternoon , harry .
tokens from your admirers .
admirers ?
what happened in the dungeon between you and professor quirrell
is a complete secret .
so , naturally the whole school knows .
i see your friend ron saved you from trouble of popping your chocolate frogs .
ron is here ?
is he all right ?
what about hermione ?
fine .
they' re both just fine .
what happened to the stone ?
relax , dear boy .
the stone has been destroyed .
my friend nicholas and i had a little chat and agree it was best all round .
but then he' il die , won' t he ?
he has enough elixit to set his affairs in order .
but yes , he will die .
how was it i got the stone , sir ?
one minute i was staring in the mirror , and then next ...
only a person who wanted to find the stone ,
find it , but not use it , would be able to get it .
that is one of my more brilliant ideas .
between you and me , that is a secret .
does that mean with the stone go like this ,
voldemort can never come back ?
i' m afraid there' re ways that he can return .
harry , do you know
why professor quirrell couldn' t bear to have you touch him ?
it was because of your mother .
she sacrificed herself for you .
that kind of act leaves a mock .
no , this kind of mock cannot be seen .
it lives in your very skin .
what is it then ?
love , harry .
love .
bertie botts , every flavour beans .
i was too unfortunate for my youth to come across the most flavoured one .
it' s then i' m afraid i' ve lost my likings for it .
i could be safe .
with a nice toffee .
at last .
ear wax .
all right there , ron ?
all right .
you ?
all right .
hermione ?
never better .
another year' s gone .
now that i understand it , the house cup needs awarding .
and the points stand thus .
in fourth place , griffindor with 312 points .
third place , hafflepuff with 352 points .
second place , ravenclaw with 426 points .
and in first place , with 472 points , slytherin house .
well done , slytherin .
however , recent events must be taken into account .
and i have a few last minute points to award .
to miss hermione granger .
for the cool use of intellect .
50 points .
second , to mr. ronald weasley .
for the best play game of chess in hogwarts has seen these many years .
50 points .
and third to mr. harry potter .
for pure love and outstanding courage .
i award griffindor house 60 points .
we tie with slytherin .
and finally , it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies .
but a great deal more to stand up to your friends .
i award 10 points to neville longbottom .
assuming that my calculations are correct ,
i believe that a change of decoration is in order .
griffindor wins the house cup .
come on now , hurry up .
you' il be late .
come on , hurry up .
come on , harry , one minute .
thought you' re leaving without saying goodbye , did you ?
this is for you .
thanks , hagrid .
go on .
listen , harry . `
if that dursley cousin of yours ,
dudley gives you any griff ,
you could always threaten him
with a nice pair of ears to go with that little tail of his .
but , hagrid , we' re not allowed to do magic outside hogwarts .
you know that .
i do .
but your cousin don' t , do he ?
it feels a bit strange going home , doesn' t it ?
i' m not going home .
not really .
