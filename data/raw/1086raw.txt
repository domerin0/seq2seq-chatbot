today' s my last day of high school , i' m not gonna miss that .
ungrateful .
so your pain is gone ?
i struggle with it , just like i struggled to give you birth ... and raise you and take care of this family .
yes , it hurts !
i didn' t ask for you to give birth to me , okay ?
that' s enough .
estela , what' s wrong with your sister ?
come and help me .
okay , seven years at m. i. t.
four years at stanford .
four years of teacher' s college .
i' il continue my education , too .
i' il backpack through europe , and ...
ana , hang on a minute .
what' s happening with the college applications ?
i' m not going to college .
what do you mean ?
you' re a smart woman with something to contribute to this world .
my family can' t afford college .
there are scholarships , grants , financial aid ... everything we' ve been talking about all year .
mr. guzman , i' m really sorry to have to say this ... but you should probably spend your time helping somebody else .
now , i have to go , but ... you were the best .
thanks .
thank you , come back again .
i' ve been waiting for this day .
yeah , me , too .
here' s your uniform .

why did you quit your job ?
why do you know about this ?
i just know .
okay , mom , i quit my job .

i didn' t get along with the manager .
so what ?
you' re just gonna have to get another job .
i know , papa , okay ?
it' s just something i had to do .
tomorrow you come to work with us in the factory .
what ?
no way !
estela , we' re very far behind .
we' re not behind .
yes , we are .
if we don' t help your sister , who else is going to ?
i don' t know , and really , i don' t care .
why do you have to say that ?
because it' s true .
estela stays up all night trying to finish those dresses .
papa , i can' t afford any more help .
that takes care of that .
if estela cannot pay ana , it doesn' t really help us .
she' il pay .
fine , i' il pay her .
she can iron .
end of discussion , senor .
who wants cake ?
i want some .
a big one .
take a small one .
mr. guzman , what are you doing here ?
are your parents here ?
yeah , but i told you ...
ana , who is it ?
good afternoon , sir .
ma' am .
i' m luis guzman .
i' m ana' s english teacher .
i speak english .
i' m sorry .
ana' s an excellent student .
i' d like to see her continue her education , go to college .
mr. guzman , of course we want ana to get educated .
we have already discussed that amongst our family .
but we need her to work now .
she can go to college later .
senor garcia , ana' s a very special young woman .
she got into beverly hills high school ... which isn' t easy , and now she can go further .
there are all kinds of scholarships .
i' m sorry , mr. guzman ... but tomorrow morning she goes to the factory ... to sew , with us .
may i ask you , mr. garcia , just to please think about college .
i' il think about it .
i' il talk to my wife .
let' s go , anita .
i told you .
she doesn' t do her chores ... she doesn' t clean her room , she doesn' t do laundry ... she doesn' t cook ...
she gives me plenty of trouble .
carmencita .
ana doesn' t give you that much trouble .
look , her teacher ... is very happy with her .
if we make an effort ...
i believe we can help her get into college , to get an education .
i can teach her .
i can teach her to sew .
i can teach her to raise her kids ... and take care of her husband .
those are things they won' t teach her in school .
it' s all right , she can get married later .
are you not listening to me ?
it' s a matter of principle .
it' s not fair .
i worked since i was 13 years old ... and ana is 18 years old .
now it' s her turn .
she has to work .
my life is over .
you' re so dramatic , just like ama .
excuse me , but i' m nothing like mom , okay ?
whatever you say .
oh , my god .
don' t even think about it .
you' il never fit into that one .
it' s a size 7 .
why do you always have to be like this ?
i only tell you for your own good .
look at you !
enormous !
don' t !
they must weight 10 kilos each !
mom , what do you think you' re doing ?
you' re so dramatic .
good morning , mrs. carmen .
good morning !
good morning , normita .
good morning , panchita .
mrs. carmen , how are you ?
very well , thank you .
normita , you must be in love .
you look so fancy , i hardly recognized you .
my fiance bought me this dress .
yeah ?
it' s beautiful .
just wait .
that happened with my husband , and then he stopped buying me clothes .
maybe it was your fault .
why would it be my fault ?
just look at you .
maybe the material got too expensive .
envy or charity ?
like my grandmother used to say , " there' s no better dressing ...
than meat on bones .
and you are not going to make me cry .
you go ahead and cry , panchita .
i' m going to the bakery .
are you a new worker ?
this is my daughter , ana .
are you going to be working here full time ?
no .
i' m just helping out my sister until i find a better job .
me , too .
i' m just working here until i win the lottery .
mujeres , this is my daughter , ana .
you know , the one i always complain about .
mommy , she' s mrs. carmen' s daughter .
i can' t believe you finally made it to the factory .
yeah , what took you so long ?
i had a meeting with a supplier , but that' s none of your business .
this is dona carlota .
this is an overlock , which makes hems .
she' s a pro .
welcome , i hope you like the job .
and this is pancha and her machine .
we already met .
don' t touch anything that belongs to pancha .
she really gets upset , you' d think it was her baby .
that' s not true .
it is true .
this is another overlock machine .
norma does the work , and she' s very fast .
i' m carlota' s daughter ... and these are my sisters , lupita and angelica .
and this is rosali , the troublemaker .
and this is ama' s station .
these scissors are yours .
don' t lose them .
everything gets lost in this place .
come on , let me show you your job .
pay attention .
ama , are you doing your work ?
yes , my general .
watch .
we do high quality work here , okay ?
that' s why i get the orders .
it' s so hot in here .
can' t you get a fan ?
we have a fan .
you know that the fan blows dust on the dresses .
always use the steam , okay ?
and please don' t burn the tulle .
okay .
okay , it' s real easy work .
and always check the level of the water and let me know when it gets low , okay ?
so i can send you out to buy some more .
when you' re done , you put the dress here ... on the bagger , you put a plastic bag over it ... and you put it on that rack for me , okay ?
if we work hard today , we' il finish these .
that' il be one hundred in size 7 .
did you hear , mrs. carlota ?
we' re close to 100 .
what a beautiful dress .
we take the finished dresses to the distributor and then start on size 6 .
how much do they pay us to make these dresses ? $18 for assembling each .
and how much do they sell them for at the stores ?
they sell them at bloomingdale' s for $600 .
we make them for $18 , they sell them for $600 ... does this seem right to you ?
just work , okay ?
i don' t think she knows how to do anything .
i don' t think she' il make it , and with her mother here ...
she' s so arrogant .
i have chisme from the market .
mommy , mrs. carmen has gossip .
i love gossip .
you should be working !
el dorado ortiz ... is secretly in love with rosali .
that' s horrible .
that dirty old man ...
looks like a shriveled up mango .
el dorado ortiz is in love with rosali .
he thinks you' re too skinny , but he would love ... to fatten you up .
but don' t get as fat as ana .
ama , we have to work now .
yes , my general .
you burned it !
ana , can' t you do anything right !
where are you going ?
you little brat .
wait !
come here !
don' t make me come after you !
ana !
what' s going on here ?
this is my mom .
is this your daughter ?
yeah , this fatty .
my daughter .
knock yourself out , ladies .
where are you going ?
where the hell are you going ?
i can' t take it anymore .
i' m too old for this .
i don' t know why i' m working .
my hands have arthritis .
and i' m going blind from so much sewing .
yeah , mama , i know , okay .
everybody knows .
leave !
if you want to leave , leave !
what ?
am i embarrassing you ?
are you ashamed to work with us ?
so much effort , so much sacrifice ...
and all for what ?
for you .
you only think i' m a beast of burden .
ama , come on let' s go .
let' s go back , come on .
oh , my god .
hold onto me .
come on , we' re gonna go back .
you have to help me .
come on .
you behave , okay ?
how cute !
look at yourself in the mirror .
good morning .
good morning , gorgonia .
how did you sleep ?
okay , and you ?
how do you think , with my arthritis ?
i see you have a new saint antonio .
that' s for ana .
and how many years have you had this one hanging here ?
that one ...
eleven years .
i put it up on estela' s 18th birthday .
i' m gonna take it down .
no !
leave it there .
who knows , estela could still get married .
it' s too late for estela to get married .
now i have to concentrate on ana .
they' re delicious .
that' s how i like them .
you' re a treasure .
grandpa ...
do you remember our gold ... close to our hometown , near the hills ?
there was a cave full of gold .
papa , those are only legends .
and the men who saw the cave and the gold ?
the gold doesn' t exist , dad .
grandpa , tell me about the treasure .
many years ago , during the revolution ... people would hide their gold in the caves in the mountains .
after the revolution , there was a rumor ... that there was a cave full of gold ... close to our hometown .
this gold can only be taken by a man with a pure heart .
i always wanted to find that gold .
grandpa , i' m sure you' re going to find it .
look , i already found it .
you are my gold .
now i want you to find yours .
jimmy .
what' s up ?
ana , how' s it going ?
mr. guzman , i did it .
i filled out the applications .
look at that , ana , way to go .
is it the truth ?
of course it is .
i don' t lie on applications .
except about my weight .
where' s the personal statement ?
i didn' t think it was necessary .
you didn' t write one ?
you have to write one .
i' m friendly with the dean of admissions at columbia .
if you write it now i can get it to him and get you in for the september semester .
really ?
but look , you need to write an essay .
about what ?
write about something you know .
you can write about yourself .
myself ?
why not ?
you can do this .
i' il keep this until you bring me the essay .
go , write .
bye .
when are you going to europe ?
hey , jimmy .
i don' t know if i' m going anymore .
my sister needs me to stay and help her with her fashion boutique .
i was thinking about joining you , but you' re not going anymore ?
no .
europe is so cool .
you' il get a whole new perspective .
what kind of perspective ?
it' s different in europe .
things are too easy here .
like you' re handed everything from school to a car .
that' s why i want to teach , do something different , you know ?
i' m doing some assistant work for mr. guzman this summer .
what are you doing ?
i have to go , so i' il see you later .
your number ?
maybe we could hang out .
yeah , i gotta go .
bye .
it' s finished .
with that music , they want to get on tv .
they need to improve a little bit .
yeah , i' d say .
carmencita , your back hurting again ?
after 38 years of sewing , what else do you expect ?
estela , ana , you really missed something in the soap opera the poor cry more .
mom , i don' t watch spanish soap operas .
it' s not a regular novela , it' s a brazilian .
they' re better .
isn' t that so ?
much better .
what happened ?
you remember juanita , the cross eyed daughter ?
yes , i remember .
well ...
this handsome , dark stranger ... comes to visit the fishing village .
and she meets him ... and he told her that he didn' t care what she looked like ... that he loves her , that he wants her ... but of course we know what he wanted , no ?
one night , without telling her parents , juanita goes out with the stranger .
mom , let me guess , she gets pregnant ?
ana , don' t spoil the story .
what happened ?
she gets pregnant .
and worse , he asks her to run away with him .
of course that means that she has to betray her mother' s wishes .
and then ?
entonces , they' re on the bus to rio ... and she sticks out her head to say goodbye ... to her mother who was crying there .
and all of a sudden this bus comes by ...
and it cut her head off !
mom , that' s the stupidest thing i' ve ever heard .
ana , you better listen .
that' s what happens to people who don' t listen to their mother .
okay .
and all you had was the headless body .
hello ?
hi , jimmy , it' s ana .
hey , ana !
are you busy ?
is this a bad time ?
i can call you back later .
i mean , i' m just calling to say hi .
no , it' s a good time , actually .
listen to this insane computer program i found on the web .
mierda . " " shit .
it' s curse words in spanish .
really ?
ya la cague . " " i screwed up .
where did you get this ?
pendejo . " " jerk . " " pinche . " " goddamn it .
all right , okay , jimmy , i get it .
hello ?
do you think i' m your maid ?
you left dishes in the sink .
get water , the burner' s here .
shut up , she' s coming .
we almost finished pinning the pattern .
look .
what do you think ?
okay .
just a few little adjustments here and then we can get started .
aren' t we supposed to be working ?
we' re already behind schedule .
why isn' t everyone here ?
norma , why are you late ?
where' s your mother and your sisters ?
estela , i need to talk to you .
okay .
estela , i' m sorry .
i say this from the heart .
why are you sorry ?
i wanted to tell you earlier , but i didn' t know how to tell you .
tell me .
what ?
i' m getting married sooner than i thought .
when' s the wedding ?
next month .
i' m so happy for you .
in mexico .
i have to leave tomorrow .
my fiance wants me to move with him to mexico .
norma , you' re my fastest employee .
i need you .
i know .
i' m so proud of the work that i' ve done for you .
i' m sorry that i have to leave .
and you' re my best boss .
my mother and my sisters are moving with us .
you' re all leaving me ?
no , norma , por favor !
it' s always been my mother' s dream to go back to her village in mexico .
i' m sorry .
perdoname .
don' t be sorry , i' m happy for you .
i just can' t pay you right now , okay ?
i' m sorry .
give my check to my cousin at the chapala market .
okay , gracias .
good luck .
mrs. carmen ... thank you for everything .
god bless you .
we need those four seamstresses to finish this work .
i mean , we never finish on time .
you know the glitz company .
they don' t pay me until we do .
i have no money to pay any of you .
i should just close the factory .
no , you can' t close the factory .
i can' t believe you' re paying us late again .
i just lost four seamstresses .
how are we gonna finish this order ?
i can wait a little bit , but not too long .
gracias , rosali .
and you , pancha ?
i' il charge you interest .
are you serious ?
no .
but let' s get back to work before i change my mind .
and you , mrs. carmen ?
what kind of a mother would i be if i didn' t help my daughter ?
and you say i don' t love you .
it' s because i love you that i make your life so miserable .
don' t love me so much .
and you , girl ?
estela , if you don' t pay me , how am i gonna save up any money ?
for what ?
forget it .
ana , you' re so selfish .
you expect me to do this dirty work for nothing ?
this is dirty work ?
this is a sweatshop .
don' t you get it ?
you' re all cheap labor for bloomingdale' s !
we are not cheap labor .
how would you know what hard work is ?
all you' ve done is flip burgers !
i' m grateful for what ama has taught me .
and i' m proud of what i do !
you little brat !
i never wanted to work here in the first place !
much less for nothing .
see the trouble you cause ?
estela ?
come on , i' m sorry , okay ?
i' il help you .
can you work until i can pay you ?
yeah .
thanks .
let' s get back to work .
you burned yourself , dear !
heal , heal , little frog tail .
if it doesn' t heal now , it will heal tomorrow .
fatty , wake up .
what time is it ?
it' s still night .
then why are you waking me up ?
i have a secret .
i' m telling it only to you .
mom , i' m sleeping .
you' re not gonna believe this , but i' m pregnant .
what ?
i' m pregnant .
how could you be pregnant ?
a woman knows these things .
but don' t tell anybody .
mom , you' re imagining things .
ana , i need you more than ever now .
it' s probably just gas .
eat less beans .
why did norma and the others have to leave ?
that doesn' t look that bad .
ladies ...
you are not going to believe this .
i heard gossip at the chapala market .
no food in the work place .
it' s our break time .
then you take a break , because i can' t afford one .
come .
our normita ... ate the cake before the wedding .
i heard that norma' s fiance convinced her to have sex ... with him the night before , and after he had a taste ...
100 people at the church , the priest waiting ... and he never showed up for the ceremony .
god damn him .
norma' s mother never approved of the man ... pero norma insisted .
no , no .
a mother knows the right man for her daughter .
mom , you' re so old fashioned .
can you believe her ?
girls nowadays think they know so much .
that' s why they end up panzonas .
no , the reason they end up pregnant ... is ' cause they don' t know how to use contraceptives .
look at her , miss know it all .
your husband won' t like you knowing so much .
why ?
a man wants a virgin .
why is a woman' s virginity the only thing that matters ?
a woman has thoughts , ideas , a mind of her own .
a mind , and thoughts ?
no more stories , ama !
estela , that' s what i do best !
my reason for living .
sorry .
what are you writing ?
i' m writing a letter to mrs. glass .
who' s that ?
she' s the owner of the manufacturing company .
she' s the one who pays us to make these dresses .
yeah , i' m asking for an advance on the dress order .
i need to pay the electricity and the monthly bills .
i' m late on the rent .
estela , that' s serious .
i know .
if you really need this money , you should go and talk to her in person .
a letter' s not gonna do anything .
she' s too busy , she won' t see me .
i' il go with you .
she' s too busy .
you' re not afraid of her , are you ?
why should i be afraid of her ?
ana , please don' t say anything , okay ?
i can try .
hi , is mrs. glass here ?
who are you ?
i' m a contractor for mrs. glass , my name is estela garcia .
do you have an appointment ?
no .
you need an appointment .
okay , we don' t have an appointment , let' s go .
hello , mrs. glass .
estela .
hi .
what can i do for you ?
i know that last month we were a couple of days late ... but ... we were hoping that ... that you ...
we need an advance .
money ... to pay the bills , the electricity so that we can work ... and get you your dresses on time when you need them .
and who are you ?
i' m estela' s business partner , ana .
ana , estela knows the rules .
i can' t pay advances .
i went out on a limb to hire you in the first place ... because i believe a woman like me should help one like you ... but i can only help you so much .
you have to help yourself and meet your deadlines .
you have until the end of the month , when the order has to be shipped .
you have 10 days , honey .
10 days , that' s it .
i' il be back at 3 : 00 .
she' s worse than you said .
did you say something , estela ?
no .
because it sounded like you did .
i didn' t say anything .
i see .
you ladies have a nice day .
can' t you keep your mouth shut ?
i was just trying to help .
i' m trying to keep the factory open for all of us .
you know , people depend on me .
your mother is waiting for you , dear .
your mother is a little crazy .
you' re just figuring this out ?
she' s asking for her little girl .
who knows what she might want ?
hi .
hi .
what ?
shut the door .
i have morning sickness .
mom , it' s not morning , it' s evening .
ana , be serious .
comfort me .
did you ever think that maybe you' re not pregnant ... and you' re just imagining all of this ?
i am pregnant .
a woman knows .
i haven' t had my period for three months .
then why don' t you go talk to the doctor , not me .
are you ready to leave ?
i' m coming , grandpa !
let' s go .
and where are you two going ?
ana invited me to the movies tonight .
i think it' s a great idea .
bye , dad .
don' t wait up for us .
have fun .
thank you , good night .
okay .
we' il meet here in two hours .
be good .
hi .
this is a great place .
yeah .
are you staring at my boobs ?
no .
yes , no .
okay .
i mean , they' re so big , why wouldn' t you , right ?
i' m a guy , i guess i kind of have to .
can we change the subject ?
yes , hi .
hi .
i made this list of topics to talk about ... so that we wouldn' t run out of things to talk about .
okay .
can i see the list ?
you have a really beautiful face .
just my face ?
i' m sorry .
you don' t take compliments well ?
no .
compliments , that' s not one of the topics on my list .
and you don' t want to show me the list ?
no .
no .
are big breasts on the list ?
hi .
let' s order .
i had a nice night tonight .
me , too .
that' s where i have to meet my grandpa .
i guess this is good night .
okay , bye .
bye .
it' s that time again , panchita ?
yes .
today' s the anniversary of my father' s death .
he was so handsome .
yes .
he was a very elegant man .
the day he died ...
i couldn' t pay the hospital ... so i pretended ... that he was still alive ... and i put him in a wheelchair ... and i took him home in a taxi .
you were a good daughter , panchita .
i tried .
hi , estela .
hi , mr. hiro .
the rent is three weeks late .
i' m so sorry .
will you be able to pay rent by the end of the month ?
yes , of course .
good .
i like having you as a tenant and i' d hate to have to kick you out .
no .
say hi to rosali for me .
i will .
bye .
papa !
anita .
what are you doing here ?
papi , i need some help .
i told estela this many times .
if you do not have the cash up front ...
do not do it .
yes , i know , but she' s working hard ... and it' s just not working out .
she still has to pay the rent .
i know , papa , but it' s not her fault .
i mean , i never realized how hard she works .
okay .
i will lend estela the money .
thank you , papa .
estela , let me see .
it' s beautiful .
did you draw it yourself ?
yes .
you' re lying .
you probably copied it from a magazine .
no , i did it .
i' m working on my own line .
would you buy a dress like this ?
of course i would buy a dress like this .
if it would fit me .
this gray dress is the biggest order i' ve ever had .
it won' t be easy .
if we don' t finish it by the end of the month the manufacturer won' t pay us .
let' s prove to them that we can do it .
let' s make 150 gray dresses of better quality than anyone else .
estela , maybe we can turn on the fan in here .
the fan blows dust on the dresses .
can you iron a little faster ?
i need help with the hems , we won' t make the deadline .
estela , it' s not that i don' t iron fast enough .
every time i finish ironing , i stop for a minute ... to really look at the dress .
i never realized how much work , " puro lomo , " as mom says ... is put into it .
and then i wake up , and i remind myself that it' s not for me .
so i put that plastic bag over it .
and stick it on the rack ... push it away .
she got a point .
come on , hurry up .
straighten up , walk like a lady .
even i , in my condition , i walk like a lady .
hi .
hi .
is ana there ?
who is this ?
this is cecilia .
yes .
i will call her for you .
do you want to hear music tonight ?
no thank you .
let' s go , guys .
good evening .
hi .
ready to go ?
what' s wrong ?
jimmy , does your mom understand you ?
most of the time .
does your mom ?
no .
i don' t know , it' s like she hates me .
she thinks i' m fat and i' m ugly and god knows what ...
you' re not fat .
you' re beautiful .
where did you tell your mom you were tonight ?
she thinks i' m at mass again .
so , is this a sin ?
no , that' s a beso .
a kiss .
can' t believe i' m leaving in two weeks to go to teacher' s college .
ana , don' t worry .
you' re gonna get accepted to college , too .
are we done ?
you have one more dress to iron .
estela , this is beautiful .
did you make this ?

it' s in new york city .
new york ?
what' s wrong with that ?
look , mr. guzman , it isn' t that we don' t want ana to go to college ... but all the way to new york ?
i' m sure there must be wonderful colleges in this area .
but none of them is columbia university .
papa , you don' t understand , it' s one of the best schools in the nation .
sir , you left your country for a better opportunity ... and now , it' s ana' s turn .
look , mr. guzman ...
raul !
senor guzman ... we are a family , and we intend to stay that way .
mama , it' s not gonna change anything .
please .
it' s okay , carmencita .
mr. guzman , ana is going to go to college .
but not now .
i didn' t come this far to see my family break apart .
papa , i don' t understand .
how is this breaking us apart ?
what about estela and the factory ?
what about it ?
what about abuelo ?
you want to abandon him ?
no .
thank you very much , senor guzman ... but this is a family matter .
thank you very much for coming all the way here to tell us .

i' m really gonna miss you .
you tramp .
what ?
you lost your virginity , didn' t you ?
mom , you' re imagining things .
i can tell !
you' re not only fat , now you' re a puta !
you would say that , wouldn' t you ?
why didn' t you value yourself ?
because there' s more to me than what' s in between my legs !
you better not get pregnant and embarrass me .
me , embarrass you ?
come on .
you' re the one pretending to be pregnant for attention .
i am pregnant .
you' re not !
yes , i am !
you' re not pregnant , mom !
you' re only pretending because you want a baby in the house .
but you can' t have a baby .
i' m not your baby anymore !
no , senora , you' re not pregnant .
of course i am .
dona carmen , don' t you think i know a thing or two about this ?
i haven' t had a period in four months .
dona carmen , that' s not unusual for a woman your age .
i think it' s about time you and i ... had a little conversation about menopause .
that means " the change of life .
mom , the doctor said no sugar .
why are you eating a flan ?
i' m having a craving .
but you' re not pregnant .
okay , i' m not pregnant .
i' m going through the change of life .
it' s over .
i' m no longer a woman .
a grandmother is what i should be at this age .
you know , ana ... you' re not bad looking .
lf you lost weight ...
just stop it !
you could be beautiful !
stop it !
you' re overweight , too !
so why should i listen to you ?
ana , don' t eat the flan .
this is beautiful .
i stink .

he who smells it first is the one who has it beneath him .
ana , please don' t waste the distilled water , it' s expensive .
estela , it' s so hot in here .
seriously , i feel like i' m in hell .
fifteen , sixteen ...

ana !
what are you doing ?
mama , come on .
it' s so hot , all the steam has me sweating like a pig .
we' re sweating , too , but we' re not taking our clothes off .

estela , rosali , pancha , please .
aren' t you hot in those clothes ?
i feel so sticky .
aren' t you embarrassed ?

the two of you should lose weight .
you would look beautiful without all that fat !
dona carmen , ana and estela are beautiful .
they look good the way they are !
thank you , pancha .
thank you , pancha .
aren' t you ashamed ?
mama , you look just like us .

make myself attractive so that i can catch a man .
ana , listen to her .
learn now or you' il end up like estela .
mama , i do want to lose weight .
and part of me doesn' t because my weight says to everybody , fuck you !
hail mary !
what are you trying to do ?
how dare anybody tell me what i should look like ... or what i should be ... when there' s so much more to me than just my weight !
what' s wrong with wanting to be thin and sexy ?
you don' t get it .
i want to be taken seriously .
respected for what i think , not for how i look .
exactly , thank you .
what if you don' t think anything ?
i look like a cow .
rosali , shut up !
stand up , you know , look at yourself .
if you' re a cow , then i' m a hippo .
