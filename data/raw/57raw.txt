chlna 859 a. d.
after 241 years of prosperity , the tang dynasty is in decline .
the emperor is weak and incompetent .
his government , crippled by corruption , no longer controls the land .
unrest sweeps the country .
village by village , an underground alliance forms ...
' the house of flying daggers ' .
based in feng tian county , near the lmperial capital ,
the house of flying daggers moves in the shadows ,
stealing from the rich to give to the poor , they earn the support and admiration of the people .
at the same time , they are feared and hated by their bitter rivals ... the local deputies ,
captain leo , captain jin .
we' re heading out on patrol .
we' re going to be busy again .
the provincial office has given us ten days to catch the new leader of the ' flying daggers ' .
what ?
it took us three months to assassinate their old leader .
ten days ?
impossible .
have you heard of the new peony pavilion ?
yes .
does anyone know you there ?
no , i haven' t been there yet .
good , now' s your chance .
any information ?
we suspect one of the showgirls is a member of the ' flying daggers ' .
ok , i' il check it out .
pull .
pull harder .
pull harder .
that' s it .
i' m done .
madam !
i' m coming .
madam .
here i am .
what can i do for you , sir ?
i heard you have a new girl .
you' re well informed .
is she pretty ?
she' s quite a beauty .
bring her to me .
there is one thing you need to know .
what' s that ?
the girl is blind .
blind ?
then she must be special .
i' m curious .
how did you lose your sight ?
i was born blind .
why would a blind girl work here ?
why can' t a blind girl work here ?
you' re right .
what' s your name ?
mei .
mei ?
every girl here is named after a flower .
why is yours so plain ?
i don' t want to compete with those girls .
what do you mean ?
the flowers here can hardly be called flowers .
real flowers bloom in the wilderness .
well said .
if you impress me
i' il take you to where the real flowers grow .
what' s your talent as the top showgirl ?
dancing .
come closer .
don' t you know the rules ?
a rare beauty in the north .
she' s the finest lady on earth .
a glance from her , the whole city goes down .
a second glance leaves the nation in ruins .
there exists no city or nation that has been more cherished than a beauty like this .

please calm down , sir .
go away .
what' s the matter ?
please let me explain .
this girl is young and inexperienced .
please forgive her .
take her away .
go away .
take her away .
stop !
captain .
this is the captain of the county .
to hell with the captain !
outrageous !
arrest him .
let me go .
who are you ?
how dare you !
i' m the captain .
you' re drunk and indecently dressed .
arrest both of them .
get your hands off me .
let me go .
please spare the girl , captain .
that man was drunk .
it was not her fault .
please don' t arrest her .
our business is new .
i rely on her to bring in guests .
how can a blind girl be a top showgirl ?
move !
she' s a dancer with rare skills .
please see for yourself .
do you know the ' echo game ' ?
i played it once ...
all right .
perform well and i' il let you go .
thank you , captain .
go and change quickly .
fantastic .
excellent !
who are you , really ?
why do you want to kill me ?
government running dogs ...
i wish to kill all of you !
i do enjoy fighting a blind girl .
we found this in her room .
you' re a member of the ' flying daggers ' .
who' s the new leader ?
where' s the new leader ?
i' il show you what we' il do if you don' t answer .
show her !
in front of you is a torture device .
your head will be put here .
your shoulder , here .
your back , here .
your legs , here .
you' il never dance again after this .
do you understand ?
you have one day to think it over .
this girl reminds me of someone .
who ?
rumor has it , the old leader' s blind daughter disappeared after his death .
it was a heavy blow to the ' flying daggers ' .
they vowed revenge for their loss , while searching for the girl .
why would the old leader' s daughter end up in a brothel ?
who owns the peony pavilion ?
perhaps the ' flying daggers ' has realized we were responsible for their old leader' s death .
forget it .
let' s turn her over for a reward , and then go out for a drink .
i have a better idea .
since we have some clues ,
iet' s follow them through for a bigger reward .
do you want me to do it ?
of course , who else ?
all right .
this girl is a rare beauty .
you know i love flirting with girls .
don' t let beauty blind your judgment .
if i die under a skirt , i can still flirt as a ghost .
who are you ?
i undressed you only yesterday .
have you forgotten me already ?
why did you rescue me ?
why do you think ?
you' re an exquisite flower .
i' il do anything to help you .
control yourself .
don' t worry .
i' m no longer a guest of the peony pavilion .
you' re not a showgirl anymore .
you' re the daughter of the old leader .
what did you say ?
how many blind girls know martial arts and carry daggers like these ?
i' ve rescued you , and your daggers as well .
why did you take such a risk ?
i hate the corrupt government and admire the ' flying daggers ' .
much obliged .
why did we abandon the horses ?
hoof prints can be easily tracked .
i have two new horses hidden ahead .
you' ve planned well .
what' s your name , master ?
just call me wind .
wind ?
i wander around all alone , come and go without a trace .
like a carefree wind ?
no , a playful wind .
you like to tease .
i wonder what you look like ?
that' s easy to find out .
here .
please let go .
this isn' t the peony pavilion .
no rules here .
you' il know what i look like if you touch my face .
come on .
it' s not respectful to touch your face first .
you prefer to start at the bottom .
that' s fine with me .
you' ve mastered the flying technique .
your right hand is skilled with a machete .
your left hand is powerful with a bow and arrow .
your heart beats steadily , you seem sincere .
you can read me like a book .
you' re a brave man .
i' m never shy around women .
you' re young , indeed .
you know how to hold your drink .
the soldiers are approaching .
i' ve lost my dagger pouch .
i' m sorry i was late .
the ' flying daggers ' are always moving .
where should we go ?
we just keep heading north .
just head north ?
they will come to us .
the ' flying daggers ' has many masters .
why did they send you as an assassin ?
no one sent me .
i came alone .
as the old leader' s daughter , you should be more cautious .
have you considered the consequences ?
i' il do anything to avenge my father .
come here .
these are men' s clothes .
put them on for now .
i won' t take advantage of you .
have you seen enough ?
please hand me the clothes .
you knew i was here ?
master wind wanders like the wind .
i' d expect you to be anywhere .
you look different in men' s clothes .
do i look awful ?
i will tell all the girls to wear men' s clothes the next time i visit the peony pavilion .
now i know you' re not shy around women .
you' re not shy either .
how do you know ?
you knew i was watching you bathe , yet you said nothing .
you saved my life .
you can look all you please .
i thought you were hot as fire .
in fact , you' re cool as water .
i don' t know you well enough .
i really care for you .
a playboy like you , are you ever for real ?
what if i am this time ?
are our men close by ?
i' m sure today' s fighting has fooled mei .
our men will ease off from now on .
good .
that' il save me some arrows .
any clues ?
not yet .
don' t let her see through you .
don' t worry .
i never fail at seducing a woman .
she trusts me .
i warn you , don' t fall for her .
what do you mean fall ?
fall into bed ?
like her father , she must be very cunning .
don' t let her fool you .
don' t be absurd .
i' m in control .
i have to get back now .
don' t turn a game into reality and ruin our plan .
who cares , as long as the plan works .
shall we rest for a while ?
i smell flowers .
you told me you' d bring me to where real flowers grow .
which is the most beautiful ?
how do i look ?
pretty as a flower .
soldiers are approaching .
i' m on your side .
you ?
i am a captain of the county .
a captain ?
nonsense .
you are the bastard who broke the jail .
you' re wounded .
is it serious ?
no .
was it someone from the ' flying daggers ' ?
it' s not likely .
then who ?
i don' t know .
he' s gone .
i guess he doesn' t want to reveal himself .
this time , i believe that you' re for real .
you' ve done enough for me .
please leave .
don' t worry about me .
we' ve come this far .
i can' t leave you now .
i hope you' re not seriously wounded .
we agreed there would be no more fights .
why did government soldiers turn up ?
the general sent them .
they don' t know you .
the general ?
how did the general get involved ?
this case is important .
i had to report it .
the general is taking over .
the soldiers didn' t have to be that aggressive .
the general ordered it .
he said we need real blood to draw the ' flying daggers ' out .
even if the blood is mine ?
jin , the soldiers ' lives and our lives are worth nothing to him .
you don' t know how i felt as i killed our own men .
i feel worse .
i am tortured .
you ?
i truly regret taking on this mission .
i' ve followed you all the way .
endured many sleepless nights .
my heart grows heavy when i think about what lies ahead .
is there no other way to do this ?
it' s the only way to expose the ' flying daggers ' .
jin , you should know , there are more soldiers ahead .
what !
the general sent them .
they don' t know you either .
you must stop them .
there is nothing i can do .
the order given to these soldiers is ' fight to kill ' .
if you don' t kill them they will kill you .
take care .
i quit !
