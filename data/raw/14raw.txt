finally ... the warring nations of earth had forgotten their differences ... and banded together to save our planet .
the united global space force was searching the galaxy ... for worlds rich with drinkable water and breathable air .
the hypergate was our best hope to colonize space ... our best hope for survival .
but as we prepared to launch ourselves ... into the black of space ... terrorists , calling themselves ' the global sedition ... ' were preparing to strike .
grissom base , this is cargo 7 requesting landing clearance .
roger , transport .
this is grissom gate control .
please download security codes .
downloading .
transport , i' ve got two blips inside your radar signature .
they' re hiding in your shadow .
i don' t see anything .
this is gate control .
battle stations .
battle stations .
two sedition fighters are attacking the hypergate .
battle stations .
gate control , this is eagle one .
i' m locked and loaded .
ready to fly .
roger , eagle one .
you' re clear to launch .
jeb , where are you , buddy ?
this cold war just got hot .
they' re sedition raiders .
it' s another mutant suicide squad .
here we go .
man to man .
split them up .
last one to kill a bad guy buys the beer .
i' m gonna go through the gate , get in front of him .
that' s not standard procedure , don .
better get inside his shields .
you gen techs are ugly up close .
target lock .
show time .
bogey one dispatched .
don , he' s right on my tail .
damn !
can' t shake him .
i' ve been hit !
weapons are off line .
i' m gonna jettison the main drive core .
there you are .
am i good or what ?
warning .
failure in redundant drive systems .
gate control , this is ranger one .
engines will not respond .
don , i' m falling towards the hypergate .
breaking thrusters won' t fire !
impact in 30 seconds .
ranger one , this is base .
rescue craft have been dispatched .
grissom , those pods will never reach him in time .
i' m going in .
majorwest, you are not authorized to jeopardize
never liked that station anyway .
warning .
proximity alert .
hang on, jeb .
i' m coming in .
abort .
abort !
i' il give you a little kiss .
don' t take this the wrong way .
impact in five seconds .
does this mean we' re going steady ?
you' re not getting out of buying those beers that easy .
with intrepid pioneering spirit , the robinson family ... will journey to the distant world of alpha prime .
what kind of future can our children look forward to ?
a future in paradise .
the jupiter mission ... made possible by the army and silicon graphics corporation .
s. g. l .
saving the future for our children .
give me a break .
holo call from houston middle school .
hello ?
hello , principal cartwright .
what has he done this time ?
he hacked our main power grid to run his experiment .
the school was in chaos .
yeah , right .
we didn' t even have lights .
this is no laughing matter , professor robinson .
will is terribly gifted .
the changing shape of education .
his little time machines , though pure fancy ... are the products of a truly brilliant mind .
no more monkey business .
i mean it .
the boy is starved for attention .
i know your life is anything but normal right now ... but wasn' t there some way ... his father' s could have attended the science fair ?
as you are aware ...
alpha prime is the only other habitable planet ... yet detected by deep space recon .
my crew will sleep away our 10 year journey there ... in suspended animation .
once we have rendezvoused with the research colony on alpha ...
i will supervise construction of a hypergate .
by then , technicians here on earth ... will have completed the companion hypergate ... in our planet' s orbit .
once both gates are complete ... ships will be able to pass instantaneously between them .
immediate colonization of alpha prime will be possible .
can' t you just use the jupiter' s hyper engine ... to zap straight to alpha prime ?
hyperspace exists beneath normal space .
if you try to enter hyperspace without a gate ... your exit factor is random .
there' s no telling where you' d come out .
ninety eight percent of the galaxy is still uncharted .
there' s a lot of space to get lost in .
how is captain daniels recovering from the flu ?
will he pilot the mission ?
ladies and gentlemen .
you came to get your first look at the jupiter 1 .
don' t you think you' ve waited long enough ?
let' s move into the launch dome .
one more question , professor .
now that the mission' s been pushed up ... how do your children feel about leaving the earth behind ?
they couldn' t be more excited .
this mission sucks !
i don' t wanna leave early .
i don' t wanna go at all .
we will discuss this at dinner .
for the last three years , i' ve missed everything training ... so i can spend the next 10 years missing everything else .
i' m not staying home for dinner .
i' m seeing my friends .
penny .
i' m going out to say good bye to my entire life .
penny , i need you here tonight .
wait a minute .
on this eve , before she' s torn from everything she knows kidnapped ... hurled into deep space against her will what thoughts fill the mind of the daring space captive ?
are there boys on alpha prime ?
what will i wear ?
what will it be like to jettison your body into deep space ?
first ... you' il try holding your breath .
but your blood' s already begun to boil .
then your skin inflates like a balloon .
then ... pop .
do they have a name for what' s wrong with you ?
dad says don' t bring them .
like anything i do matters to him .
don' t sweat it , kid .
i got apology videos for two birthdays .
he forgot last year completely .
this mission' s the only thing he cares about anymore .
so that' s a no to family dinner ?
let' s see .
do i spend my last night on earth ... watching mom and dad pretend not to be fighting again ... or blow 10 years worth of allowance at the mall ?
you do the math .
mom' s gonna go thermal .
what' s she gonna do , ground me ?
i' m nervous about jamming in a new pilot the last second .
the global sedition is getting brave .
first the hypergate , then daniels .
next time , they may attack the launch dome .
we can' t afford to wait .
will' s science fair .
reminder .
apology videoforwill .
he' il understand .
ben , listen . my family is on this mission .
i need a pilot who' s more than just spit and polish .
i' ve got your man .
he just doesn' t know it yet .
at ease , major .
why was i pulled from active duty ?
those gen techs may attack again .
i need to be up there .
do you know professor robinson ?
by reputation .
your father' s battle strategies ... were required reading at the academy .
what can you tell me about the jupiter mission ?
the jupiter is an oversized robot .
everything' s automatic .
any monkey in a flight suit ... can pilot that ship out of the solar system ... and set her down on alpha prime .
it' s a baby sitting job , sir .
no offence .
major , are you aware earth' s resources are severely limited ?
every schoolchild knows ... that our recycling technologies will cure the environment .
sending a family across the galaxy ... is a stunt to sell computers to people of all ages .
every schoolchild was lied to .
recycling technologies came too late .
all fossil fuels are virtually exhausted .
the ozone layer is down to 40 % .
in two decades , the earth will be unable to support human life .
the new global sedition knows the truth as well as we do .
they' re building their own hypergate .
they hope to colonize alpha prime first .
if they' re successful ... western demons like you and i , major west ... will be left on earth to die .
captain daniels doesn' t have the flu , does he ?
captain daniels was murdered in his apartment last night .
the flu story is a cover .
i flew with mike .
we should blast their bases !
a decisive strike now !
my squadron is alert status
your rescue stunt was foolhardy !
i had a friend in trouble .
disobeyed a direct order because of a friend ?
i did ... sir .
he' il do .
congratulations .
you' re the new pilot of the jupiter mission .
where' s my money ?
the sedition hired me to provide access ... to daniels ' apartment and no more .
my work is done .
they found a replacement pilot .
our attack on the hypergate failed .
how tragic for you .
we require a more direct intervention on your part .
i see .
it will cost you .
i' m afraid that my price has just become ... astronomical .
holograph off .
come in .
control hasn' t received results of the pre flight exams .
the robinsons have checked out 100 % .
they' re fit as a fiddle and ready to fly .
wish them luck ... for me .
mission protocols are simple .
robinson is in command ... unless you encounter a military emergency .
in that case , majorwest , you are in charge .
i' m a fighter pilot .
there must be better candidates .
hell , even my own family can' t stand me .
shut up .
jebwalker .
he' s an excellent flyer .
he' s perfect for this mission .
welcome aboard , major .
looks like somebody sprung for the full extras package ... on this beauty .
if you have to be a baby sitter , it' s not such a bad nursery .
wouldn' t you agree ?
i don' t get it .
i can' t get the cryo sleep systems up over 96 % .
dr smith approved the specs .
dr smith is the base physician .
i am responsible in flight .
these tubes will be perfect , or the ship will not launch .
is that clear ?
absolutely , doctor .
judy , i want to introduce you to majorwest .
he' il be taking mike' s place .
he' s heavier than mike .
we' il have to recalibrate .
i' d be happy to discuss my dimensions , doctor ... say , over dinner ?
west .
i' ve read about you .
you' re a war hero , aren' t you ?
well , yes , actually .
who was it who said , ' those who can' t think , fight ' ?
i think that it was me .
it was nice to have met you .
that' s one cold fish i' d love to thaw .
i' m not gonna make it over for dinner tonight , dad .
it' s gonna be a long flight .
maureen , pick up the phone , honey .
i know you' re there .
are you still packing ?
i' m just leaving .
go to bed .
sweetie ?
he won first prize again .
is this the new model he' s been working on ?
crazy idea he' s got about a ... time machine ?
pretty sharp stuff for a midget .
sorry about dinner .
that new pilot
john , the family needs you here .
this whole thing is about family .
my only condition for accepting this mission ... was that we could bring the children with us ... not leave them behind ... so future generations would have a new home .
you' re off saving humanity , so what does it matter ... thatwill has to blackout his school ... to get his fathers ' attention ...
penny' s been dragged home by security 3 nights in a row ...
judy' s become a ghost , like her father ?
i have to compensate for the new launch time .
what do you think i' m doing ?
revising life science protocols .
i' m also dealing with two kids ... who are leaving an entire planet behind .
sorry , but there' s no manuals on how to deal with this .
maybe it doesn' t do any good ...
saving a world of families if we can' t save our own .
is that it , professor ?
john .
i know , baby .
i' m scared , too .
med supplies for the jupiter 2 ?
that' s our last crate .
what a mess .
they' re not taking any chances .
forgive me if i forego the kiss , my sleeping behemoth ... but the time has come to awake .
robot is on line .
reviewing primary directives .
one preserve the robinson family .
two maintain the ship' s systems .
spare me the chatter , my steely centurion .
sadly , i fear i have far more dire deeds in store for you .
robot is on line .
reviewing primary directives .
sixteen hours into mission , destroy robinson family .
destroy all systems .
that' s more like it .
farewell , my platinum plated pal .
give my regards to oblivion .
apparently you have completed your mission on schedule .
i do so admire a spot of timely terrorism .
i thought i told you never to call me here .
the transmission signal could be traced .
i just wanted to express my most sincere gratitude ... for your unflagging loyalty .
good work , good doctor ... and good bye .
jupiter 1 launch in three minutes .
mom , just
shoot .
mom , i' m fine .
that' s supposed to be there .
this is almost acceptable .
mom , don' t .
what ?
vogue says this will be the style in 10 years .
can we cut back on her oxygen ... so she' s not so annoying when she wakes up ?
does he have to wake up at all ?
that' s it .
i' m gonna turn this spaceship around .
satellite defence net locked and a ok .
everything' s gonna be fine .
30 seconds .
mark .
hey there , buddy .
com links encoded and secure .
good night , guys .
good night .
here we go .
artificial gravity at 100 % .
you get a ' c ' in paternal expression ... but an ' a ' for effort .
i' m doing the best i can .
come here .
you always get an ' a ' in this .
main drive systems on line .
sweet dreams .
see you there .
you are at ' t ' minus one minute and counting , majorwest .
houston , the bird is hot .
she' s all yours .
i' il try to give you a smooth ride .
mission control , this is dr robinson .
we are in the green .
roger , doctor .
you are go to initiate cryo stasis .
one question .
is there room in these tubes for two ?
there' s barely enough for you and your ego .
don' t sweat it , doc .
i do this all the time .
just drive carefully .
you are at ' t ' minus 40 seconds and counting .
ready .
you are at ' t ' minus 30 seconds and counting .
you are at ' t ' minus 20 seconds and counting . control , this is jupiter 1 .
the robinsons are all tucked in .
we are ready to fly .
majorwest, your escape vector is clear of all traffic .
op is go on your command .
roger , houston .
and the monkey flips the switch .
jupiter 1 booster disengaged .
this is jupiter 2 .
diverting all spacecraft control to the main computer .
eight years of flight training .
navigational holographics on line .
fifty combat missions .
course confirmed for slingshot exit of the solar system .
so i can take the family camper on an interstellar picnic .
ten years is a lifetime .
sleep well , old friend .
i never liked these freezing tubes .
bad dreams .
navigational interface confirmed .
cryo sleep systems at 100 % .
shit !
robot is on line .
sixteen hours into mission , destroy robinson family .
destroy all systems .

i can' t stop this infernal contraption on my own .
emergency cryo stasis desequencing in process .
destroy all systems .
destroy robinson family .
maureen , the children !
destroy .
run !
destroy .
deactivate safety .
that was a mistake .
dad !
mom , let' s go !
will , stop !
destroy .
destroy jupiter 2 .
destroy robinson family .
look away , baby .
robot , disable pulse blaster .
command accepted .
cancel attack sequence and stand by .
if the family won' t come to the science fair ... bring the science fair to the family .
showoff .
robot .
on line .
standing by .
return to docking bay and power down .
major , you all right ?
next picnic , no robots .
where' s judy ?
stabilize the operating systems .
fire control .
attempting containment protocols .
i want to go home now .
navigation' s down .
system shorts everywhere .
damn .
communications are out .
link up the secondary system .
shunting power from reserve .
come on .
try it now .
navigational boards are lit .
can we reroute ?
i' m locked out of the helm .
nothing in computer control .
main com to manual .
see if she' il respond .
the main subroutine won' t open .
i' m gonna try remote ops .
smith !
get back !
get away from me !
what the hell are you doing here ?
majorwest , thank god it' s you .
i was in here doing some last minute checks .
someone hit me from behind .
that' s sedition technology .
you' re a damn spy .
you did this .
what are you doing ?
throwing out the trash !
i need help !
i can' t getjudy out !
she' s dying !
touch me , and the girl dies !
i don' t deal with dead men .
kill me , kill the girl .
how much is your revenge worth ?
i can save her life ... only if you give me your word as an officer you' il spare mine .
help her .
i' ve got helm control .
we' re way off course .
we' re caught in the sun' s gravitational pull .
is that what that big ball is ?
we' ve got four minutes before the outer hull begins to melt .
i need you to check on the thruster alignments .
professor !
i' il try for the mercury mines .
i' il need dr robinson' s portable gurney .
you' il find it below .
smith , come on !
you tried to kill my family .
we trusted you .
it' s the world behind the world , professor robinson .
lie once , cheat twice , and everything becomes clear .
do not mistake my deception for a character flaw .
it is a philosophical choice ... that i' ve found in a study of the universe .
it is a way of life .
you' re a monster .
perhaps , but i' m also the only one ... who can save judy' s life .
penny , precious , i want you to short the power on my command .
does he have to call me precious ?
penny , precious .
now !
she' s not breathing .
sick bay , move !
the sun won' t let us go .
heat shield breach , 60 seconds .
i need options , professor .
we have to divert all power to the engines .
i' m rerouting life sciences .
rerouting life support .
engines at80 % .
there' s no cardiopulmonary or respiratory functions .
clear .
again .
clear .
alert .
medical .
rerouting error .
systems are crashing .
we' re losing her .
do something .
come on , child .
put a little heart into it .
the other life i save ... will be my own .
wake up , baby , please .
that' s all the power we' ve got .
i' m putting the pedal to the metal .
here it goes .
she can' t break free .
she doesn' t have enough thrust .
there' s gotto be a way to get through this .
that' s it .
it' s working !
what is ?
if we can' t go around the sun , we go straight through it ... using your hyperdrive .
engage the hyperdrive without a gate ?
we could be thrown anywhere in the galaxy .
anywhere but here .
on my mark .
three , two , one , initiate .
hyperdrive at 100 % .
major , you have the com .
dad ?
dad !
let' s see what this baby can do .
maureen , everyone ?
where is judy ?
she' s ok .
she is , thanks to me .
here i am .
either i should cut down on the liquids ... or i should sew in a new flap because it was really hell ... getting out of that thing .
you' re ...
vitals are normal .
pulse and respiration seem to be .
are you ok ?
i' m fine .
come here .
will every little problem be an excuse for familial sentiment ?
how much , smith ?
what was the price tag that you put on our future ?
you can' t do it , can you, john ?
you can' t kill the man without becoming the monster .
coward .
what' s happened, john ?
where are we ?
i bypassed most of the damaged systems .
we' il have to repair the rest manually .
you had me worried , doc .
nice to see you thawed .
you have a puzzling definition of a smooth ride .
computer , map our current position .
searching for recognizable constellations .
this database has star maps of all the known galaxy .
i don' t recognize a single system .
we' re lost .... aren' t we ?
easy , doc .
god .
please .
the cryosuit absorbed most of the electrical charge .
you' re lucky this wasn' t your hide .
doctor , is that concern i detect in your voice ?
great bedside manner .
what' s that ?
a battle scar ?
sort of .
it was a tattoo .
an ex girlfriend' s name , but i had it removed .
wouldn' t it be easier to use a magic marker ?
yeah , well , that' s me .
a girl in every port .
so , major , no family ?
nothing to tie you down , no one to miss ?
i' ve never been the fit in and play nice type .
you think that' s romantic ?
i don' t .
but what about you , doc ?
is there some lucky little nerd you left behind ?
i spent three years working on this mission .
we' re trying to save the planet .
i haven' t had time for fun .
if there' s no time for fun ... then what are we saving the planet for ?
here .
thanks .
i hate being little .
i think it broke .
i' il try and fix it .
why aren' t you up on deck with mom and dad ?
have you met our parents ?
good point .
popcorn , orchids ... waves , billy ... kissing .
chocolate .
it' s a list ... of everything we left behind .
never love anything , kiddo ... ' cause you just end up losing it .
smith could still hurt us .
maybe i shouldn' t let him live .
but ...
how can we bring civilization to the stars ... if we can' t remain civilized ?
right , professor ?
have you noticed that you take the opposite position ... to whatever i say ?
of course i do .
we' re married .
alert .
spatial anomaly in progress .
what the hell ?
i must be dreaming .
that looks like a ship .
it appears to be some sort of hole in space .
where does it lead ?
a reasonable question .
major , wait .
i' il wait later .
pull back .
let there be light .
proteus ?
she' s one of ours , all right .
all right .
i' ve never seen a ship like this .
no response to hails .
scanning all military and civilian frequencies .
nothing .
i' m getting inconsistent life signs ... but they may be sensor ghosts .
computer is still on .
i' il try the standard docking codes .
control codes confirmed .
initiating docking sequence .
weird .
what kind of ship is that ?
that' s not one of ours .
boys , that' s not even human .
if this is all a dream ... why can' t there be more girls ?
as part of her enslavement ... the brave young space captive penny robinson ... is forced to utilize her dazzling technical expertise .
identify yourself , soldier .
west , major , united global space force ... requesting permission to see the prisoner .
proceed , majorwest .
could he be cuter ?
i don' t think so .
breathe , penny .
unlock .
these quarters are unacceptable .
we' re going to check out the probe ship .
maybe we can figure out how they got here and how to get home .
have a wonderful trip .
put this on .
you' re coming with us .
out of the question .
i am a doctor , not a space explorer .
what you are is a murderous saboteur .
i am not leaving you here ... so you can do more harm than you' ve already caused .
i absolutely refuse .
give me an excuse to kill you .
please ?
black was always my colour .
lock .
activate standby .
crush , kill , destroy .
surprise .
safety on .
dad , chill .
it' s ok .
i hacked into his cpu , and then ...
i bypassed his main operating systems ... and accessed his subroutines .
he' s basically just running on remote control .
i know i haven' t been around
professor .
we' re ready to go .
we' il talk later , son .
take care of my dad .
ok , robot ?
vacuum check complete .
oxygen levels are normal .
microbe scans are negative .
clear .
the air is stale , old .
that' s the smell of ghosts .
i' ve got her on board computer up .
not working ?
she' s working , all right .
just i don' t know .
too damn fast .
dad , do you hear something ?
like the drip , drip of blood .
you really need to shut up .
here .
this matter appears biological .
nothing good will come of this .
you , of course , being the expert on space exploration .
let' s go .
trust me , major .
evil knows evil .
motion sensors are still working .
this way .
rambler crane series robots .
but like no design i' ve ever seen .
well , well .
aren' t we the poor cousin ?
down here .
it' s a remote op station .
come on , dr smith .
could this ship be a prototype ?
looks like some kind of firefight .
captain' s log is degraded .
maybe i can gather some fragments .
sorry .
the hyperspace tracker seems to be functioning normally ... but we cannot process all the data .
there is no sign of the jupiter 2 .
i have exceeded my timetable .
when did he make major ?
i want this on the record .
i am not willing to give up .
don would keep looking for me .
that' s it .
the rest of the data' s totally corrupted .
how could they launch a rescue mission for us ... when we' ve only been lost a day ?
there' s no data on the alien ship ... but they brought in something that was attached to its hull .
got it .
some sort of egg sac ?
get back here !
be happy to oblige ... although i don' t think it' s me you should be worrying about ... but rather these .
i' m detecting motion .
behind you .
after it .
move !
bring smith .
don' t even think about it .
hydroponics .
growth like this would take decades .
unhand me , you mechanical moron .
don' t move .
easy .
easy there , buddy .
no one' s gonna hurt you .
easy .
relax .
excellent .
looks like you made a friend .
still , i' d wait a few weeks ... before tattooing her name on your arm .
do yourself a favour .
don' t evolve .
charming .
the dr dolittle of outer space .
this could be a creature from that alien ship .
but this guy' s no pilot .
he looks like a child .
try it now .
strange .
the scales are giving off heat .
i' ve tapped into the internal sensor array .
there' s no other animate life present .
besides us , this ship is totally deserted .
a ghost ship .
the flavour of the day is banana beef .
who thinks up these combinations ?
good .
majorwest , i highly recommend you never breed .
that , by the way , is my medical opinion .
little thing was hungry .
i' ve got their star maps on line .
here we go .
more systems than i' ve ever seen .
finding a route to alpha prime .
downloading to jupiter .
i don' t like the sound of that sound .
they' re moving .
get this infernal ... creature off me !
come here .
john , get the hell out of there .
mom says , ' get the hell out of there . '
evacuate .
now !
the controls are too slow .
activate holographic interface .
holographic interface , on line .
they eat their wounded .
seal the bulkhead .
codes are locked .
duck .
emergency bulkhead .
fire sensor activated .
emergency bulkhead closure .
stop !
we have to get that door open .
open , damn you !
get out of here .
what is with me and these damn doors ?
i can' t override the fire protocol !
a million bucks worth of weaponry ... and i' d trade it all back ... for a lousy ... can of raid .
stand clear .
get moving !
go !
come on !
maureen ... can you get me anything ?
cycling through a vacuum check .
i' m overriding .
no way it' s that easy .
run !
run !
get back !
get back to the ship !
move !
got it .
try it now .
mom says , ' try it now . '
can we save it ?
can' t without letting the spiders into the ship .
leave him behind !
that spider scratched me !
stop laughing , you little worm .
good bye , robot .
you couldn' t save him , kid .
save him ?
of course .
what are you trying to do ?
prepare to disengage !
this is a fun picnic .
first yellow aliens , now giant spiders .
the crowd goes wild .
recall your childhood nightmares , major .
monsters are rarely so easily dissuaded .
why don' t you talk to them , bug to bug ?
i think they' d rather come inside .
arming torpedoes .
fire in the hole .
alert .
detonation failure .
the robot must have damaged the detonator cores .
they won' t blow .
alert .
outer hub has been compromised .
dna extrapolation coming up .
silicone based , mantium shell , lack of respiratory system .
means they do live in deep space .
tiny front brain implies communal relationships .
like bees .
if the biology lesson is over , i could use some help .
they may be attracted to heat and light .
inner hull breach in 15 seconds .
i' m bringing the proteus fusion drives on line .
it' s working .
let' s turn up the heat .
what are you doing ?
never leave an enemy stronghold intact .
stop !
that' s one of your fathers ' first rules of engagement .
that is a direct order .
i hate spiders .
that' s coming fast .
get into the harnesses now .
manual helm , engage .
children , secure ?
secure .
i' m in .
pull up .
really ?
no kidding .
thanks .
coming in too hot .
i' il try and slow us down .
hang on !
everybody by the numbers .
life sciences , still breathing .
video mechanics ...
ok .
mission medical , i' m alive .
me , too .
robotics , i mean .
i' m alive ...
majorwest' s poor excuse for piloting skills notwithstanding .
oh , dorothy .
back in kansas at last .
you violated a direct order .
about half the core material' s burned out .
we' il never generate enough power to break orbit .
we can get off the ground ... but getting back into space is another story .
i ordered you not to blow that ship' s reactors .
life support is marginal .
it' s gonna get cold in here tonight .
also , the pod and the chariot are pretty much scrap metal . don' t you walk away from me when i' m talking to you .
give it a rest , professor .
i was technically still in command .
i am commander of this mission .
look , no offence ... but you' re an egghead with an honorary rank .
no one ever intended for you to handle combat situations .
you handled it brilliantly , sending us crashing down here .
those aliens posed a continuing threat .
i made a judgment call ... and , if i have to , i' il make it again .
you of all people should understand that .
your father would back me up .
my father is dead ... killed in one of those combat missions you admire so much . my family is on this ship , and you will follow my orders ... whether you agree with them or not .
is that clear ?
save your speeches .
i like you , but i' m gonna do whatever it takes ... to ensure the success of this mission ... with or without your help .
i s that clear ?
am i interrupting something ?
no , really .
i think you two should slug it out .
here we are , stranded on an alien world ... and you want to get into a pissing contest ?
please , go for it .
i' il have judy down here to declare you both unfit ... and i' il take over this mission .
i don' t want to hear another word from you .
is that clear ?
not ... another word .
better .
if you' ve finished hosing down the decks with testosterone ...
i suggest you come with me .
i may have found a way off this planet .
tell me about it .
damn bug bite .
she ...
she really is an interesting specimen .
huh , doc ?
she' s fascinating .
the retinal aperture dilation ... seems directly linked to the skin pigmentation .
what ?
can i keep her ?
she' s not just another fad you can pick up and throw away .
oh , please .
she' s all alone here , and i promise i' il look out for her .
i promise .
she kind of needs me .
the minute you misplace her , you forget to feed her
don' t smile .
i mean it , pen .
thanks ... doc .
we' re both a long way from home , aren' t we , little one ?
blarp ?
that' s what we' il call you blarp .
nice girl .
pretty girl .
nice .
the atmosphere here can sustain human life .
i' ve located 500 rads of radioactive material ... five miles west .
we' il need at least that much to get the core functioning again .
we start out at daybreak .
be safer that way .
those are my orders .
i agree with your recommendation .
dtente' s a beautiful thing .
it' s nice to see you found a corner to suit your talents .
turn down the bed before you leave .
i gave my word i' d let you live .
i never said for how long .
family hour is over .
we' re dying here .
robinson is out of his league .
look into his eyes and tell me you can' t see his fear .
i fought in the millennial wars .
survival is a soldier' s game .
we both know this civilian fool will lead us straight to hell .
robinson needs our help , if he wants it or not .
with minimal force , we could take this ship ... and assure them we shall continue at your command .
of course .
my god ... you' re right .
how could i have been so blind ?
i' il just run and get you a gun so we can hijack the ship , ok ?
sarcasm is the recourse of the weak mind .
i' m hiding the pain .
really .
lock .
your pain ... has just begun .
starlight , star bright .
a million strange stars , and only one wish .
i wish we were home .
never seen a sky look so alien .
we really are lost , aren' t we ?
when the first sailors circled the globe ... saw a brand new sky ... they thought they' d sailed off the edge of the earth ... but they were really just around the corner .
you' re saying we should just billow our sails ... and let the wind take us home ?
is that it ?
those sailors ... found familiar shapes ... in the stars ... to make the sky seem more friendly ... and to help them find their way home .
that' s how the constellations were born .
porky , the wise and mighty pig .
the great ... big eared bunny bugs .
the way you got us down here , that was pretty flying .
my quarters or yours ?
excuse me ?
don' t play coy .
we' re the only single people of consenting age in the galaxy .
how much more of a set up do you need ?
so you figure , why not dispense with the pleasantries ... and get down to business ?
you have a way with words .
do you want to show me how you handle the helm ?
right here on this console ?
right here would be fine .
why don' t you just hang on to your joystick ?
excellent technique , major .
really .
will was looking for you .
i sent him back to his room .
he' s decided he can rebuild the robot .
he wants to stay up all night and show me his designs .
funny creatures , men .
try so hard not to be their fathers ... end up making the same mistakes .
we can' t get off this planet , let alone get back on course .
i don' t have time .
just listen to him .
it doesn' t matter what he says .
just listen .
sometimes especially in the eyes of their fathers
little boys have to come first .
as soon as we get back up into space ... we' il spend a lot of time together , i promise .
it' s nice having your whole family under one roof .
even if we did have to go ... halfway across the galaxy to manage it .
good night, john .
good night , maureen .
good night, judy .
good night, will .
good night , penny .
you guys have gotto be kidding .
good morning, will robinson .
solar panels are charged .
the radioactive material we need for the core ... is in the centre of that bubble .
i was afraid of this .
ok , everybody , let' s get settled now .
i think this ' bubble ' out there ... is exactly the same thing we passed through in space .
both of them are opening and closing doorways .
doorways to where ?
doorways in ... time .
you can' t be serious .
time travel is impossible .
it' s not .
just improbable .
what if we crossed into a time ... years after earth sent a rescue mission ?
perhaps the professor hit his head when we landed .
think about it .
the way the proteus seemed deserted for so long .
your friend looking so old .
so if we walk inside that bubble ... we could be walking further into the future .
dad , what if the doorways aren' t natural ?
this kind of phenomenon could only be produced naturally .
that bubble' s the kind of side effect ...
i predicted my time machine would do .
what if someone built a device
son ...
i appreciate your input ... but now is not the time for flights of fancy .
you never listen to me .
not ever .
this time bubble could be causing these earthquakes .
no telling how long before this planet breaks up entirely .
the major and i are going to locate ... the radioactive material for the core .
we may have very little time .
i' m leaving now .
that' s a surprise .
you' re the most important thing in the world to me .
one day , i hope you' il be able to understand that .
what if ... one time you don' t come home ?
whenever your grandfather went on a mission ...
he' d leave these with me for safekeeping .
when he came home , i would always be there ... waiting to give them back .
i' m coming back .
i promise .
listen ... about last night ...
go on .
you can do it .
i' m sorry .
see , that wasn' t so difficult .
like pulling steel needles through my cheeks .
then you understand what saying this feels like .
try to come back in one piece .
listen , doc , i' m ...
i' m thinking this is your basic ' kiss for luck ' occasion .
wouldn' t you agree ?
thinking .
it' s not really your strong suit , is it ?
i' ve got a fix on the radioactive material .
that was scientific .
scared ?
there' s an alloy in this crater wall ... that' s disabling the com links .
you' re not going to be able to communicate with the ship .
come home to me , professor .
i love you , wife .
come here , squirt .
nice girl .
pretty girl .
nice .
it' s ok .
you' re still in one piece .
come on .
can you hear me , robot ?
hello ?
systems error !
robot unable to locate motor controls !
unable to
calm down .
what is happening to me ?
i didn' t have enough time to finish the download .
warning !
penny , give it back !
my circuits are unbalanced .
so i had to finish you off with another personality .
i put my mind inside of yours .
that explains this warm fuzzy feeling ... when i think about baseball .
strike !
you' re out !
but this does not compute .
what ?
robot tried to destroy the robinson family .
why did will robinson save robot' s personality ?
i guess sometimes friendship means listening to your heart ... not your head .
put that in your memory bank .
don' t worry .
i' m gonna build you a new body .
mom always said i should try to make new friends .
i need a microsealer .
i got it .
after much deliberation ... the space captive has finally decided ... to accept her new role as a member of the crew .
the robinsons , after all , can obviously use her help .
blarp , come back here .
theoretically , this future would be fixed ... unchanged by what we do or did in the past
why don' t you give the old egghead a rest ?
out here we got two moons , a crater the size of miami ... and that would be one great climb .
my father would have liked you .
what' s that ?
this metal' s decades old .
what kind of a nightmare is this ?
where the hell are we ?
the question is , when the hell are we ?
i will tell you a joke .
why did the robot cross the road ?
because he was carbon bonded to the chicken .
we have a lot of work to do .
that sounds like old morse code .
what does it say ?
' danger , will robinson , danger . '
william .
come in .
unlock .
you said someone was in danger .
we all are .
you are wise to arm yourself .
this gun is set to fire for me only ... so don' t try anything funny .
lock .
you misjudge me .
i only want to help you .
help us ?
you tried to kill us .
but now our fates are intertwined .
if your father and that idiot west fail ...
i have no chance of getting home .
it' s in my best interests that they succeed ... and i always follow my best interests .
what monsters roam these alien wilds ?
they' re fools !
to set off blindly across this savage land .
much as i hate to admit it ... it will be much harder without them .
what are you talking about ?
they' il be back .
they' il be ok .
will they ?
someone should go after them .
unlock .
i forbid it .
you' re a boy .
a clever one , but a child nonetheless .
this planet is likely full of predators .
even if you found them , what if they' re hurt ?
ravaged ?
dying ?
what good could you do ?
you can help them .
you' re a doctor .
i' m a doctor .
we made it .
mom didn' t see us .
that' s fantastic .
i told you we could get into the bubble this way .
the bubble' s growing !
run , child !
cool .
wait !
come on .
we can always go back .
it' s just like stepping between two rooms .
i can barely contain my glee .
dad' s signal is ... this way .
i loathe children .
billy ... kissing ... hot wings , orchids , corn .
waves ... billy ... popcorn with ... kissing ...
what did you find ?
come on .
no time to dawdle .
let' s move along .
follow your fathers ' signal .
come on .
all things really do come to he who waits .
what is this place ?
the shock must have scrambled your brain .
take a look around .
don' t you recognize this spot ?
you' re home .
this can' t be .
what have you done to the ship ?
where is my family ?
what chance do you think your family had without you ? a few spiders survived the destruction of the proteus .
they reached this planet and ...
i can still hear the women scream .
who are you ?
you don' t recognize me ?
i' m your son will .
dad' s signal is just over this ridge .
be still , my foolish heart .
shit .
a boy of your intelligence should never swear .
shit .
indeed .
look , father ... what my flights of fancy have wrought .
i used your hyper engine to build my time machine .
ok , robot , put him down .
affirmative .
where are we ?
i think the jupiter 2 , but in a different future .
father ?
once this core material ... is fully introduced into the control console ...
core material .
if we could get that back to our jupiter ...
i will open a doorway stable enough ... for one person to take one trip through time ... and space as well .
commence proto generation .
cool , huh ?
today , i will change history .
i' m gonna go back to that day you dragged us into space .
i' il stop the ship from taking off .
i' il save the family .
earth , october 1 , 2058 .
target lock confirmed .
excellent .
son ...
look around .
the force of your time machine is ripping this planet apart .
these violent distortions in time ... are being caused by your experiment .
what if it has the same effect on earth ?
what if , in getting home ... you destroy earth in the process ?
i know you mean well .
i' m going home .
i' m going to save the family .
you' ve gotto listen to me .
i' m your father' s !
my father ?
let me tell you about my father .
i' il never forget that morning 20 years ago .
what was it you said ?
' i' m coming back .
i promise . '
you promised ... and you never came home .
my father' s not coming to the rescue .
what do you think you' re doing , young man ?
let me tell you about life .
around every corner , monsters wait .
i know .
i am one .
we monsters have no fear in devouring little boys .
to survive , you must be fully prepared to kill .
i can do it .
can you ?
listen to me , my child ...
i' ve crossed this world with you ... risked my life , but i would not throw it away .
who knows what dangers lie ahead ?
you can' t protect us .
i can .
i will .
gimme the gun .
enable gun for all users .
voiceprint confirmed .
a brief lesson in survival on this world or any other never trust anyone .
especially me .
it' s almost time .
i hope it works .
never fear ...
smith is here .
don' t move , professor robinson ... or this peculiar family reunion will be tragically brief .
i' il ask you to step away from that .
it' s a time machine , you idiot .
i had hoped to take over the ship with this .
one of life' s little ironies .
let' s try this dance again .
you are the puppet , i am the puppeteer .
do try to get it right this time .
robot , you will respond to my voice alone .
affirmative .
we need electric disrupters .
that' s good , gargantuan .
you did it .
just like i imagined .
you linked the dimensional sifter ... to the navigational array .
that' s how it can be in the same place at the same time . but the spatial delivery system , the targeting laser ...
i never thought of those . the future is never what it seems like when you' re 10 .
say good bye to your past !
your future lies with me .
i' m going home in your place .
what are you grinning at ?
look around you ... at this hostile world .
do you think a boy could have survived all alone ?
never fear ...
smith is here .
it' s dr smith .
hello .
how nice to see me again after all these years .
confused ?
have i changed ?
the spider' s sting had some unexpected side effects .
my unique gifts gave me an advantage ... in this quarrelsome world .
after the women were savaged ...
i became the father will never had .
two decades of agony taught me the error of my ways .
but you , your crude ambition fills me with self loathing .
you see , i have looked within me ... and what i see is you !
i never liked me anyway .
robot , kill them all .
wait .
dr smith , please .
don' t .
very well .
robot , take them inside and keep them there .
if they move ... then kill them .
proceed or be destroyed .
nothing works .
i' il draw his fire , you grabwill and get out .
halt !
stop !
do you remember me ?
do you remember what i taught you about friendship ?
i need you to help us now , because we' re friends .
logic error .
friendship does not compute .
forget logic .
act with your heart .
robot has no heart .
robot is powered by a fusion pulse generator .
every living thing has a heart .
my programming has been modified to remove all emotion .
any attempts to override command protocols ... may result infusing my neural net .
please , robot ?
if you don' t let us go , we' re all gonna die .
i' m asking you now , will you help us ?
will you be my friend ?
robot attempting to deactivate control bolt .
commands overridden !
do it !
destroy robinson family !
destroy !
you did it .
robot will save will robinson .
robot will save his friend .
where are they ?
wait here .
without that core ...
i can' t promise we' il get off this rock .
see if you can make it back to ourjupiter .
i' il get the core material and meet you there .
we don' t have the trackers to find our way back . the family needs their father .
the crew needs their pilot .
i can' t fly the ship as well as you can .
you' re their best chance to survive .
listen to me .
i know you never wanted to take this job .
i think you' re going to turn out to be a grade a baby sitter .
so ... the camper' s all yours now .
take care of them .
good luck .
dad !
professor !
remember the space spiders in the proteus ?
they' re not going to be able to get back .
enable all missiles .
but the warheads don' t work .
just do it .
look !
damn , he' s still breathing .
fire in the hole .
so these sailors , they drew shapes in the sky ...
look !
it' s a flare !
... to help them find their way home .
danger, will robinson !
climb on !
hurry !
field dampeners on line .
portal compression commenced .
tell me again , old monster , how did the girls die ?
we' ve been over this before , son .
in all the years since ... the spiders have never resurfaced .
why ?
let' s forget the past .
portal aperture reduction , 50 % .
careful , child !
the plasma around the portal ... will rip a man into pieces !
haven' t you made the doorway ... too small ?
not for me .
but then i' m not going , am l ?
spiders didn' t kill the girls .
it was you .
i just never let myself see it .
you kept me alive because you needed me .
because i could build this for you .
poor boy .
did you really think i would let you go home ?
let all that i have become vanish ?
look at me !
i am no mere man !
i ... am ... a ... god !
within these egg sacs grow the seeds ... of a master race of spiders .
we shall descend upon helpless earth ... an entire planet to rule !
an entire planet on which to feed !
time to die ... son .
i' m not your son .
good bye .
my father once said ...
' evil always finds its true form . '
you should have killed me when you had the chance .
you were right .
i couldn' t kill the man ... but i can kill the monster !
spare me the fury of the righteous .
i think there' s time for a snack before my trip .
the pain .
you ain' t seen nothing yet .
remember the proteus ?
these monsters eat their wounded .
take all the time you want to die !
wake up , son !
dad ?
core material insertion complete .
all table run 2058 .
mission control .
you could' ve taken the core and left before it was too late .
i couldn' t let you fall .
you' re my boy .
mom !
it' s them .
hi , mom !
you all right ?
you' re not as dumb as you look .
i' m gonna get your name tattooed right here .
greetings .
where' s john ?
the bubble closed behind us .
it was his only way back .
i' m sorry .
we' ve already begun the pre flight countdown .
i' m going to save as many lives as i can .
i kept hoping somehow he' d make it back .
let' s go , major .
good bye , my love .
engaging primary thrusters now .
look .
he made it .
go .
we' re not getting any altitude .
we don' t have enough power .
i' m sorry .
i couldn' t save them .
so many years ago .
i can still feel it our sun ... our earth .
it' s all i thought about going home .
a long time ago , you told a small boy ... that one day he' d understand how much his father loved him .
i could never see how much you cared ... until now .
come .
let' s go .
i kept hoping he' d make it back .
good bye , my love .
look !
don' t make me wait another lifetime to know how you feel .
dad !
dad , it worked !
come with us !
i can' t .
only enough powerfor one person , one trip , remember ?
it' s good to see you again , mom .
it' s good to see you all .
take care of them , will .
don' t forget me .
he sacrificed everything for his family .
i' m glad you came back .
i just want you to know i love you .
i love you very much .
the planet is breaking up around us .
we' re doomed !
boy , that felt good .
get us airborne .
i' m going to try to reach escape velocity .
we don' t have the core material .
the gravity wells will pull us back down .
we might be able to
we won' t make it .
i know .
we have to go ... down through the planet as she' s breaking up .
we can use the planet' s gravity ...
what ? to throw us out the other side and back into space .
that' s insane .
i don' t have time to argue .
that' s a direct order .
yes , sir , commander .
this should be interesting .
i see it .
full burn .
stop !
right !
left !
let me drive .
all right , everybody , hold your noses .
rock and roll .
amazing .
nice work , flyboy .
i earn that kiss yet ?
you earn this .
this one' s on credit .
coldfish , huh ?
there you are .
come here .
where have you been , you little creep ?
little creep ?
oh , great .
warning , major west .
my sensors indicate we have a problem .
the planet' s gravityfield is collapsing .
we' il be sucked in .
no way to get clear in time .
the hyperdrive .
i' m accessing the proteus star maps .
here we go again .
targeting alpha prime ...
i hope .
initiate ... now .
