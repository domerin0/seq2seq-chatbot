eight years .

aaron harstad , yeah .
sad story .
about five months back , he fell asleep at the wheel and hit a tree .

i was planning to work at the mill , but you never mentioned it closed .
we didn' t want to bother you when your father got laid off .
i got my business .
you saw the furniture outside .
and i substitute at the elementary school .
michelle pitches in ... we try to keep things simple .
pete .

it was chris ' room first .
your tent' s going to take on water .
i can show you how to rig it .
doesn' t look like it' s going to rain to me , colonel .
sit down .
eat something .
first of all , i was a sergeant .
i worked for a living .
a grunt .
did you ever smoke anybody ?
pete !
poppa' s still got your gun locked up in the garage .
would you teach me how to shoot ?
i figured that' d be scrap metal by now .

i' m still hoping you' il melt that thing down on your own .
sorry , pete .
whatever .

you want a beer ?
no .
believe it or not , i quit drinking .
i' d take a soda , though .
okay .
here .
thanks , man .
like that ?
when you left town ... it gave me the idea i should do something with my life , too .
so i went down to seattle , got a guitar , and became all about music .
and then , pretty soon , i was about music and drugs ... and pretty soon i was basically just about drugs ... and ended up doing two years for b and e.
i' m sorry .
look at me now , though , right ?
i' ve been clean and sober 14 months .
doing construction and renewing those supportive and healthy friendships ... from my past .
matter of fact , i talked to the bastards , told them you were back ... and they asked me to politely remind you that it is saturday .
as in ...
as in , kick off' s in 20 minutes .
like old times .
you guys still doing it .
we' re still doing it .
playing ball ?
absolutely .
let' s go , superstar !
just like the old days .
go deep .
come on .
when did that happen ?
jay hamilton field .
his parents hadn' t left him the mill for more than two minutes ...
before he shut it down .
why ?
heads up !
because i opened my casino .
still got a gun , huh , jay ?
still got your reflexes .
what ?
did you get tired of being all that you could be ?
no .
i' m still all i can be .
really ?
i' il just have to see about that .
yeah .
what brings you home ?
i just want to relax .
catch my breath .
you ?
relax ?
yeah .
not today .
i got it .
let' s go .
come on !
is that how it' s going to be ?
that' s how it is .
full contact , huh ?
that' s two hand touch .
too rough ?
sorry , ladies .
pick up the outside !
fumble !
set !
how' s that for touch ?
that was pretty , wasn' t it ?
want to go get your pads ?
that the best you got ?
what ?
here , take a walk ...
and knock a long loose ?
touchdown .
first and your last .
you want to go ?
nobody' s going .
we' re not going to go .
you almost caught it .
we stop them here , we win , right ?
right , boys , last play .
you know how i like winning .
we need to put this to rest .
i will take care of ray .
you two cross .
you stay in and block .
booth ?
isolate on vaughn .
you two cross ...
just give me the ball .
go low .
left knee .
all right , man .
you got it ?
on the first hut .
ready ?
break !
be strong .
all right , chris vaughn .
last chance .
black nineteen !
black !
watch the outside !
i' m open !
that' s game .
sorry about that .
cool , man .
nice game , ladies .
what the hell was that ?
that was a great game , wasn' t it ?
is that the bad one ?
yeah , it was good .
hey , welcome home .
good to be back .
see you around .
if you' re not doing anything later on , want to come by the casino ?
introduce you to some nice girls .
drinks are on me .
what do you say ?
see you tonight .
cool .
i' il see you later on .
be good .
hey , sarge .
good game .
maybe next time .
hold up .
maybe next time i won' t see you in the bleachers , smoking weed .
welcome home , buddy .
i thought you had to be native american to own a casino .
hamilton' s one sixteenth blackfoot now .
put it on his application .
and what he slid under the table convinced the powers that be it was true .
it' s ours for the taking tonight .
let' s pick some cherries , boys .
here we go .
i' m feeling lucky .
just so you guys know , i' m done after i triple my money .
that' s what you said last time .
you wound up selling your body for bus fare .
he had to walk .
nobody' s going to have any problems finding this place .
it' s the subtle attention to aesthetics that i find most impressive .
blends in with the mountain so nicely .
hi there .
hi .
how you doing ?
see ?
not bad , huh ?
it' s not bad .
a lot of pretty girls .
i' m getting chips .
let' s gamble .
we' il see you at the shower tower , okay ?
isn' t it wonderful ?
all your gambling needs under one great , big roof .
you got your atm machines , tellers to cash your paycheck ... and when you' re here , you don' t got to worry about things ...
like child support , rent , laws of mathematical probability .
gentlemen , mr. hamilton would like to invite you to the vlp lounge .
the dream team .
you all healed up ?
nice place .
welcome to my world .
tonight all the drinks are on the house .
if you need a line of credit , say how much .
if you need a little female companionship , done .
all right ?
get inside .
have a good time .
where you going ?
don' t you worry about me .
i got a few things to do .
enjoy .
just remember , nothing in here is free .
ma' am .
cherry shot ?
ray , be nice .
come on , this place is nothing but fake boobs ... and real assholes , if you ask me .
just water for me .
drink up .
we got money to win and girls just waiting .
we are vlps .
here' s to you , chris .
welcome home .
cheers .
let' s play , boys .
go right ahead .
already lost $1 ...
good night .
okay .
don' t say we never did nothing for you .
don' t worry , buddy , everybody' s scared their first time .
come on .
get in there , chris .
okay , just sit back and enjoy it .
this' il get you started .
lf you' re not back by morning ... we' il send a search party .
have fun .
stop drinking .
you from here , or are you just visiting ?
a little of both .
i grew up here .
so you' re seeing all the old faces .
you could say that .
your voice sounds very familiar .
chris .
deni .
look who' s back .
so , good surprise ?
i told you it was better than gambling .
you met candi ?
hello .
hey , candi .
let' s go .
six , easy six .
looking for a six to win .
we can do a six .
can we do a six ?
i think i can do a six , right ?
we got liftoff !
whack it , boys .
whack it .
blue or pink , what do you think ?
who' s up for two out of three ?
i' m getting killed .
let me have a c note to put $200 on a bet .
no .
come on .
hell , no .
look at them .
he' s hot .
that' s what i' m talking about .
give me a hard six . $5 , hard six ?
yes .
i' m in .
hard six . $5 on hard six .
there' s another $100 .
boom .
give me some dice .
looking for a six .
all right .
oh , please .
please .
thank you .
and you .
jimmy , don' t roll .
give me the dice .
no , i got it .
hard six , six .
looking for a six .
seven out .
line in , the dark side wins .
last come' il get you some .
you' re good .
but i saw it .
saw what ?
i saw the switch .
this is a clean game , asshole .
let' s see about that .
bet you' il roll a seven .
it' s not your roll , sir .
sir , it' s not your roll .
will you call security ?
put your bets down on the passline .
these dice are coming up seven .
why don' t we just let it go ?
no .
we' re going to let it ride , jimmy .
the dice are coming up seven .
it' s not your roll , sir .
come on , baby .
what a surprise .
no , folks .
no payouts .
wait a minute .
calm down .
just take care of that bet , then we' re even .
i would , but it wasn' t a legitimate bet .
you' re not the shooter .
security .
it' s not your roll , sir .
is there a problem ?
the problem is your dice are loaded .
does your boss know about this ?
just give me my money .
come on .
let' s go .
what now , bitch ?
come on !
special forces .
wow .
i' il take that .
what are you doing ?
special forces .
special treatment .
this guy knows hamilton .
you just hold him down .
come on , burke .
folks .
he' s pretty banged up , inside and out .
whoever did this left him for dead .
a lesser man wouldn' t have survived .
i need a statement from him , doctor .
he' s in no condition to give you one ...
i' il also need a copy of your write up , with toxicology ...
and blood alcohol level .
what are you talking about ?
i' m just trying to get some facts .
you need to be arresting whoever tried to kill my brother , not testing his blood .
i' m just doing my job , michelle .
okay ?
i understand how you feel .
but we still don' t know who started all this .
it wasn' t chris .
just find out who did this to him , stan .
i' il do my best , mr. vaughn .
i really will .
in the meantime i have to file a full report .
will you let me know when i can talk to him ?
thank you .
he' s going to be fine , michelle .
thanks .
beautiful flowers .
thank you .
they' re for my best friend .
hey , sarge .
so much for our vlp status .
don' t they teach you any basic fighting skills in the army ?
how did you do ?
not good .
but i tell you , that guy was feeling me this morning .
you okay ?
that was a hell of a homecoming party .
chris , i don' t know if you noticed , but this ain' t exactly home anymore .
hang on .
let me help you .
come on .
i' m good , mom .
i got it .
need some help ?
no .
i' m just milking it .
there' s some old crutches in the garage .
thanks , pete .
crutches .
that' s nice .
did you see the hole ?
mind if i watch tv ?
no , that' s cool .
somebody' s feeling better .
little bit .
you make this ?
need anything ?
something wrong ?
no , it' s good , man .
it' s good .
no , i' m good , dad .
thanks .
changed the plugs a while back .
i appreciate that , dad .
i might' ve had serious issues with your career choice ... but it just didn' t seem fair to take it out on an innocent truck .
where you headed ?
i was going into town to get supplies .
want to come ?
let' s go .
your whole life , all you wanted to do was get out of here .
what made you come back now ?
you' re going to think i' m crazy .
i would think about the mill .
when i was a kid going to visit you at work , the smell of that fresh cut cedar ...
you remember that smell .
i remember a lot of nice things before the mill closed .
when did they go out of business ?
closed about six months ago .
there' s a home depot about 15 minutes up the road .
and that ?
don' t ask .
first of all , i just want to say thanks .
for what ?
for making that stickman .
he' s been fired and his gaming permit' s been pulled .
i just have no idea why my security cameras didn' t catch that .
they miss a lot in your place , don' t they , jay ?
look , chris , i hate seeing you like this .
your boys did it .
wait a second .
so they got a little rough .
they' re a bit edgy .
understandably .
you don' t know what kind of assholes they have to put up with on a daily basis .
look , they' ve been reprimanded .
but they say you went nuts , man .
i' m sorry .
insensitive .
i know the proper term that vets use is post traumatic stress ...
what the fuck you talking about ?
whatever .
you tore my place apart ... and it wasn' t easy to get my guys to agree not to press charges .
chris , if you had a problem , shouldn' t you have come to me ?
i want to bring you inside .
i want to make you head of security .
what do you say ?
no .
i guess you probably need time to think about it .
i figured as much .
this is for you .
it' s a little something to help you get , you know ...
come on , man , don' t be like that .
i came all the way out here to your house , just to see you get back on your feet .
i' m going to the sheriff .
i' m really sorry you feel that way .
i' il see you around , chris .
i know , it was a good time , wasn' t it ?
excuse me .
excuse me .
i got to call you back .
hey , chris .
it' s good to see you up and about .
you' re looking spiffy .
i' m here to press charges .
this isn' t about that incident at the casino a while back ?
yeah .
it is .
because that matter' s closed .
you' re lucky you weren' t brought in on charges .
i mean ...
did you even look into it ?
they did an internal investigation .
that' s good enough for me .
an internal investigation ?
i know you' re familiar with the term no fly zone .
because that' s what the casino is .
since the mill closed down ... that casino is the main source of revenue in this town .
so case closed , basically .
we' il see you .
i' m not going to let this stand .
excuse me ?
what did you say to me ?
i said i' m not going to let this stand .
you' re lucky to be alive right now .
that' s all you need to be concentrating on .
this is my town .
okay ?
i' m the sheriff here .
i' il tell you what will stand .
not the other way around .
now please get out of my building .
come in .
thanks .
this belongs to you .
i appreciate that .
i thought this was history .
could have left it in the trash , but i ...
deni ?
nice to see you , dear .
hi , mrs. vaughn .
can i talk to you outside for a second ?
quick walk .
mom , i' il be right back .
how you been ?
been better .
talk to the sheriff yet ?
i went down to the police station .
i talked to somebody with a badge .
he sure as hell didn' t seem like much of a sheriff .
he' s up for reelection , you know .
maybe you could take his job .
somebody ought to .
how about you ?
nothing but sunshine and pine trees .
been reading these books .
teach you how to cultivate your happiness .
focus on the future .
go with the flow , that sort of thing .
is it working ?
i have my moments .
so , the casino , huh ?
yeah .
been there almost a year .
treating you good ?
a lot better than it treated you .
i like that .
jay hamilton' s done well for himself , hasn' t he ?
he' s a real go getter , that one .
he must be .
i heard he got you .
that lasted about eight minutes .
it was a long time ago .
you still work for him , though .
rent' s got to be paid , chris .
i suppose so .
hope to see you around .
do you ?
thanks for the jacket .
and where is he ?
it' s okay , mom .
he' s stabilized .
it was close .
crystal meth .
i' m sorry .
i never did it before .
it' s true .
we might' ve kind of pushed him into it .
where' d you get the drugs ?
i' m not really sure ...
stop .
where ?
from the security guys working at the casino .
chris , wait .
call the police .
no .
it won' t do any good .
is pete okay ?
he' il be fine .
what are you doing ?
no , chris .
not like this .
listen to me .
if you go out of here with that gun , they' re going to nail ...
i' ve been looking for you .
guess that changes our relationship a bit , huh ?
you should not have come looking for trouble .
keep your hands up .
get out of the vehicle now , chris .
now !
step back , please .
just move toward the front of the car .
put your hands on the hood .
i advise you to give this offer more than a little serious thought .
if you go to trial , you stand to do 18 years .
now , this is a sweetheart plea .
normally they wouldn' t even put it on the table ... but your military record can' t be ignored .
three months home arrest , some community service ...
pretty generous offer , chris .
but i' d have to plead guilty .
look at it from the other side .
there' s over a dozen witnesses , none of whom will paint a flattering picture .
he started busting up the machines .
there was a gunshot .
he just went crazy .
a complete psychopath .
they' re only offering me this deal just to keep me quiet .
i still say you should take it .
i wasn' t wrong .
and i won' t say i was .
our job is to keep order .
there was no chance of that once he came in .
me and my men , we were just trying to control him .
he' s highly trained , violent .
a very dangerous person .
so violent , so dangerous , so highly trained ... that he dispatched six of the casino security staff single handedly .
six men , single handedly .
to hurt people and destroy property .
he went directly for everything .
he just came in and took over the place .
you said he broke your arm .
yeah , that' s correct .
my right forearm .
both bones with a single shot .
it was crazy .
toss a couple of drunks now and then .
guys try to grope the girls .
but nothing with this sort of violence .
did he give you any kind of advance warning ... a chance to defend yourself ?
we tussled , but he' s a big guy .
he was on a mission .
besides , he seemed to be too busy enjoying himself from what i could see .
so from what you saw , he seemed to have some kind of purpose ?
he had a point to prove .
i was emptying machines when he came in and started swinging .
i was trying to get out of there .
he was a menace .
a very dangerous person .
military trained .
he seemed like a complete psychopath .
nothing close to this .
i didn' t know what he' d do .
i was frightened .
he came for us .
no doubt in your mind ?
no doubt .
i have no further questions .
mr. crowe , you may present your client' s case .
you' re fired .
your honor , i' d like to plead my own case .
order !
if you choose to represent yourself , and not be represented by legal counsel ... you realize that you can' t then claim a mistrial on that basis ?
yes , i do .
very well , mr. vaughn .
i don' t deny anything that was said here today .
does that mean you' re changing your plea to guilty ?
i' m not guilty of anything ... except standing up for myself when the law wouldn' t .
objection .
he' s trying to introduce prior events .
sustained .
mr. vaughn , stay on point .
i grew up in this town .
people used to walk tall in this town .
they wouldn' t have traded the mill for a crooked casino .
we' re not here to listen to civic speeches ...
and they wouldn' t have stood around while drugs were sold to kids .
objection !
sustained .
mr. vaughn , you' re close to being held in contempt .
i was justified in what i did .
and if you acquit me of these charges , then i' m gonna run for sheriff .
mr. vaughn .
and if elected , i' m gonna fix this town .
order .
please take your seat .
mr. vaughn , you are now charged with contempt .
and i will make sure that this ...
objection .
sustained . ... never happens to anyone again without punishing those who did it .
i' m ordering the jury to ignore what they' ve just seen .
mr. vaughn , take your seat .
order .
or you' re all charged with contempt !
mr. foreman , has the jury reached a verdict ?
we have , your honor .
defendant , please rise .
we find the defendant , chris vaughn , not guilty .
this is mine .
sheriff vaughn !
you won the election .
congratulations .
but we do have a tradition of professional courtesy up here .
and i can personally vouch for each and every one of these men .
they' re good deputies .
you' re all fired .
hey , chris .
license and registration , please .
you' re joking , right ?
license and registration .
what' s the problem , sheriff ?
you .
and the drugs you' re peddling out of your casino .
the only thing that' s going on in my casino is construction .
you took care of that .
that' s right .
and i plan on taking care of everything else , too .
a casino is a license to print money .
why would i jeopardize that by selling drugs ?
because you owned the town , jay .
that' s changed now .
really ?
the only thing i think has changed around here ... is that you get to wake up every morning and put on that nifty little badge .
but underneath it is the same guy who couldn' t make it playing college football ... and apparently couldn' t make it in the army ... and not really ever gonna make it as a cop .
is that right ?
yeah .
and if you push too hard , you' re going to be a man who never gets to see 40 .
license , please .
thanks , sheriff .
sir , get your taillights fixed .
it' s your last warning .
what' s wrong with my taillights ?
they' re broken .
morning , sheriff .
morning , deputy .
no .
come on , man .
you know i hate cops .
you' ve been sheriff for about two minutes , and i' m already starting to hate you .
i' m a convicted felon .
i' ve got pull around here .
now you' re a crooked cop doing favors for friends .
that' s how it starts .
next thing you know you' il be taking bribes , setting up roadblocks ...
frisking dudes ' crotches .
are you done ?
ray , i need your help .
don' t do that .
i need you to take me to drug school .
i get to wear a uniform ?
the stuff in this town is five star , factory pure .
so let' s go get the factory .
easier said than done .
we know hamilton' s boys are selling that shit down at the casino .
yeah , but 99 % of the time they' re clean .
so we got to play follow the money , starting with the tweakers .
that' il give us the suppliers .
these guys are real edgy , so delicacy is the key .
then we put the squeeze on them ... till they spit out the location of the next buy .
where' d you learn that , ray ?
cops .
that' s a good show .
we strike .
i thought you said delicacy was the key .
that' s right .
delicacy and precision .
hey , what' s up ?
get out of here .
you' re sure you' re not carrying anything ?
i don' t have shit .
officer .
yeah .
search him .
this is going to be a switch .
spread your legs .
arms down .
you been working out ?
nothing there .
somebody needs a bath .
now you read me my rights , then you take me in ... and i call my lawyer .
okay .
but i have a hunch there may be something else in here .
could be .
go to it , deputy .
have a good time .
he ain' t talking .
i know .
handles pretty good .
he' s clean .
guess we got to go with plan b.
screw you both .
i do have a bit of information for you .
it' s not just me , actually .
there' s a whole lot of people in this one .
spit it out .
you' re gonna get hurt .
what an idiot .
why does it always have to be your fight ?
you might need this .
no .
i put my guns down a long time ago .
come on .
you' re just being stubborn .
you and me both , boy .
chris , listen .
you be careful .
i will .
please step away from the vehicle !
mr. booth , are you still upset over that body cavity search ?
i forgot , you got no vehicle .
please disperse !
there is nothing to ...
can i talk to you ?
sure .
over here ?
i' m gonna stay here with him tonight .
i need you to look after my parents ' place .
think they' re gonna take it that far ?
i' m with you , man .
i' il check in later .
okay .
a drive to right field .
it' s dropping for a single .
you making house calls ?
don' t shoot .
hey .
how' s the food around here ?
nice .
salad , fried chicken ... potato salad .
do you have glasses ?
yeah .
do you have to work tonight ?
i quit .
i figured you were making some changes around here ...
i could make a few myself .
salt and pepper ?
who is that ?
pete .
want something to eat ?
no .
i' m good , man .
i got to get a bigger bed .
no , you don' t .
do it .
i' m hungry .
we' ve got leftovers .
i want pancakes .
