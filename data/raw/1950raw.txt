gentlemen , cock your pistols .
barry' s father had been bred , like many sons of genteel families ... ... to the profession of the law .
there is no doubt he would' ve made an eminent figure in his profession ... ... had he not been killed in a duel ... ... which arose over the purchase ofsome horses .
barry' s mother , after her husband' s death ... ... lived in such a way as to defy slander .
many a man who had been charmed by the spinster ... ... renewed his offers to the widow .
but she refused all proposals of marriage ... ... declaring that she lived only for her son ... ... and the memory of her departed saint .
first love !
what a change it makes in a lad .
what a magnificent secret it is he carries with him !
the tender passion gushes out of a man' s heart .
he loves as a bird sings ... ... or a rose blows from nature .
killarney .
now , what shall it be ?
turn around and face the wall .
the object of barry' s attention , and ... ... the cause of his early troubles ... ... was his cousin , nora brady by name .
i have hidden my neck ribbon somewhere on my person .
if you find it , you can have it .
you are free to look anywhere for it .
i will think little of you if you do not find it .
i cannot find it .
you haven' t looked properly .
i cannot find it .
i' il give you a hint .
i feel the ribbon .
why are you trembling ?
at the pleasure of finding the ribbon .
liar .
about this time the united kingdom was greatly excited ... ... by the threat ... ... of a french invasion .
the noblemen and people of condition ... ... loyally raised regiments ... ... to resist the invaders .
their scarlet coats and swaggering airs filled barry with envy .
brady town sent a company to join ... ... the kilwangen regiment of which john quin was the captain .
the whole country was alive with war' s alarums ... ... the kingdoms ringing with military music .
redmond , what is the matter ?
were you obliged to dance five times with captain quin ?
i don' t care a fig for captain quin .
he dances prettily , and is a pleasant rattle of a man .
he looks well in his regimentals .
he asked me to dance .
how could i refuse him ?
but you refused me .
i can dance with you any day .
to dance with my cousin looks as though i could find no other partner .
besides , captain quin is a man .
you' re only a boy and penniless .
if i meet him again , you will find out who is the best man .
i' il fight him captain as he is .
oh , don' t be so silly !
i mean it .
but captain quin is known as a valiant soldier .
it is mighty well of you to fight yokels ... ... but to fight an englishman is a different matter .
you best have him take you home .
redmond !
barry resolved never to see nora again .
but such resolutions , steadfastly held for a whole week ... ... are abandoned in a few moments of despair .
no , nora , no , except for you and four others ... ... i vow before all the gods my heart ... ... has never felt the soft flame .
ah , you men , you men , john ... ... your passion' s not equal to ours .
we are like some plant i' ve read of .
we bear but one flower and then we die .
you , you , you mean you ... ... never felt an inclination for another ?
never , my john .
how can you ask such a question ?
oh , darling norelia !
nora was chaperoned by her brothers mick and ulick ... ... whose interests would be affected ... ... by the favourable outcome of her affair with quin .
redmond , how nice to see you .
redmond !
how could you do this to me ?
redmond , what' s the matter ?
what are you saying ?
i think this might be the moment to return something to you .
thank you , redmond .
i must have forgotten it .
yes , you did .
captain quin , may i introduce my cousin , redmond barry .
miss brady , it would appear ... ... you both have something private to discuss .
it would be best for me to withdraw .
captain quin , i have nothing private to discuss with my cousin .
miss brady , it appears you have a great deal to discuss .
captain quin , he don' t signify any more than my parrot or lapdog .
indeed !
are you in the habit of giving ... ... intimate articles of your clothing to your parrot or lapdog ?
mayn' t i give a bit of ribbon to my own cousin ?
you' re welcome , miss .
as many yards as you like .
when ladies make presents to gentlemen , it' s time for other gentlemen to retire .
i wish you both a good day .
jack quin !
what' s the matter ?
i' il tell you , sir .
i' ve had enough of miss brady and your lrish ways .
what is it ?
we' il accustom you to lrish ways , or we' il adopt english ones .
it is not the english way for ladies to have two lovers .
and so , i' il thank you to pay me the sum you owe me .
and i resign all claims to this young lady .
if she fancies schoolboys , let her take ' em , sir .
you' re joking !
i never was more earnest .
john , wait .
meddling brat !
your hand is in everybody' s pie !
what business have you to quarrel with a gentleman of substance ?
redmond , me boy , take a seat .
mrs. brady and ladies , if you please .
this sort of toast is drunk too seldom in my family ... ... and you' il please to receive it with all honours .
here' s to captain and mrs. john quin and a long life to them .
kiss her , jack , for faith you' ve got a treasure .
come on , jack .
there' s the man !
a long and happy life together .
a long and happy life together .
thank you .
redmond !
here' s my toast to you , captain john quin .
redmond , how dare you behave like that in my house !
mrs. brady , take the children out .
my dear fellow , are you all right ?
in heaven' s name , what does all the row mean ?
the fact is , sir ... ... the young monkey' s in love with nora .
he found her and the captain in the garden today .
now he' s for murdering jack quin .
mr. brady , i' ve been insulted grossly in this house .
i' m not satisfied with these ways of going on .
i' m an englishman !
and a man of property !
and this impudent young swine ... ... should be horsewhipped !
mr. quin can have satisfaction any time he pleases ... ... by calling on redmond barry , esquire of barryville .
i' il see the boy home .
a pretty day' s work , master redmond .
knowing your uncle is distressed for money ... ... trying to break off a match which will bring l1, 500 a year into the family ....
quin has promised to pay off the l4, 000 which is bothering your uncle .
he takes a girl without a penny ... ... a girl that' s flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts .
and missing them all !
and you , who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father ....
i am .
and this is the return you make for his kindness ?
didn' t he harbour you when your father died ?
hasn' t he given you and your mother a fine house , rent free ?
mark this , and come what will of it ... ... i will fight the man who pretends the hand of nora brady .
i' il follow him if it' s into the church and fight him there .
i' il have his blood , or he' il have mine .
faith , and i believe ye !
i never saw a lad more game in me life .
give me a kiss , me boy .
you' re after me own soul .
as long as i live , you shall never want a friend or a second .
will you take my message to him ?
and arrange a meeting ?
well , if it must be , it must .
look here , redmond , me boy , this is a silly business .
the girl will marry quin , mark my words .
and as sure as she does , you' il forget her .
you' re but a boy and quin is willing to consider you as such .
right , quin ?
yes .
now , dublin' s a fine place .
if you' ve a mind to ride there and see the town for a month ... ... here' s ten guineas at your service .
will that satisfy you , captain quin ?
yes , if mr. barry will apologize and go to dublin ... ... i will consider the whole affair honourably settled .
say you' re sorry , redmond .
you can easily say that .
i' m not sorry .
and i' il not apologize .
and i' d as soon go to dublin as to hell .
then there' s nothing else for it .
god bless you .
this isn' t my pistol .
it' s all right , it' s one of mine .
yours will serve , if it' s needed , for the next round .
good luck , redmond .
gentlemen ...
... cock your pistols .
gentlemen ... ... aim your pistols .
one .
two .
three .
is he dead ?
quite dead .
this has been a sad day' s work for our family .
ye' ve robbed us of 1, 500 a year .
now you' d better ride off before the police are up .
they' d wind of this before we left kilwangen .
come on , redmond , i' il go home with you .
how different barry' s fate might have been ... ... had he not fallen in love with nora ... ... and had he not flung the wine in captain quin' s face .
but he was destined to be a wanderer .
and the battle with quin set him on his travels at an early age ... ... as you shall soon see .
the boy must go into hiding for a short time , anyway .
dublin' s the best place for him .
he can stay there ' til matters have blown over .
but the child has never been away from home before .
wouldn' t he be as safe here ?
i wish that were true , aunt belle .
but the bailiffs may be on their way already .
now , dublin is five days ride away from here .
there' s not a soul who' il know him there .
i don' t want to harp on unpleasant matters ... ... but you do know what can happen to him if he' s taken .
i' il be all right .
i' il be all right in dublin , mother .
no lad with liberty for the first time , and 20 guineas in his pocket ... ... is very sad .
barry rode towards dublin thinking not so much of . .. ... the kind mother left alone , and the home behind him ... ... but of tomorrow and all the wonders it would bring .
excuse me , miss .
would it be possible to have a drink of water ?
good day to you , young sir .
good day .
will you join us in a drink ?
no , thank you .
would you like something to eat ?
that' s very kind of you , but i have to be on my way .
thank you .
goodbye .
excuse me , sir .
good morning again , young sir .
don' t even think about it .
get down off that horse .
raise your hands above your head , please .
come forward .
stop .
how do you do .
i' m captain feeney .
captain feeney !
captain feeney , at your service .
the captain feeney ?
none other .
may i introduce you to my son ... seamus ?
to whom do i have the honour of speaking ?
my name' s redmond barry .
how do you do , mr. barry ?
now we must get onto the more regrettable stage of our brief acquaintance .
turn around and keep your hands high above your head , please .
there must be 20 guineas in gold here , father .
you seem to be a very well set up young gentleman , sir .
captain feeney , that' s all the money my mother had in the world .
mightn' t i keep it ?
i' m just one step ahead of the law myself .
i killed an english officer in a duel , and i' m going to dublin until things cool down .
mr. barry ... ... in my profession we hear many such stories .
yours is the most intriguing and touching i' ve heard in weeks .
nevertheless , i cannot grant your request .
but , i' il tell you what i will do .
i' il allow you to keep those fine boots , which normally i would have for myself .
the next town is only five miles away .
and i suggest you now start walking .
mightn' t i keep my horse ?
i would like to oblige you ... ... but , people like us must be able to travel faster than our clients .
good day , young sir .
you can put down your hands now , mr. barry .
gale' s regiment of foot , commanded by lieutenant general charles gale ... ... which has distinguished itself during the recent troubles ... ... wants several men to supply the places of those veterans ... ... who have deserved to be pensioned at one shilling a day .
all clever young fellows who are free and able ... ... and are ambitious of becoming gentlemen by bearing arms ... ... are hereby invited to meet the recruiting officer ... ... who promises that they shall meet with every encouragement ... ... that merit and good behaviour can entitle them to .
those meeting the qualifications will immediately receive ... ... his majesty' s royal bounty of one and a half guineas ... ... with complete clothing , arms and accoutrements .
king george and old england forever .
for a young man in difficulty ... ... who had killed a man in a duel and was anxious to find refuge from the law ... ... the chance to earn distinction in the european wars ... ... seemed a stroke ofgood fortune .
and king george needed men too much to heed from whence they came .
hey , lad !
lad !
can i have a new beaker ?
this one is full of grease .
covered in grease !
give the gentleman a towel and a basin of turtle soup .
if you want to vex him , ask him about his wife ... ... the washerwoman , who beats him .
mr. toole , is it a towel of your wife' s washing ?
they say she wipes your face often with one .
ask him why he wouldn' t see her yesterday when she came here .
mr. toole , why did you hide when mrs. toole came to visit you ?
afraid of getting your ears boxed ?
gentlemen , you may fight it out with fists if you choose .
we' il form a square for that purpose .
gentlemen , step this way , please .
shake hands .
shake hands .
take your stance .
no biting , kicking or scratching .
the last man to remain standing is the winner .
gentlemen , commence fighting , now !
barry' s training continued at the camp .
within a month he was transformed into a proper young soldier .
the regiment' s strength was steadily increased ... ... by the arrival of other troops ... ... in preparation for joining their armies fighting in germany .
one occasion ... ... brought the welcome appearance of his second in the fatal duel ... ... captain grogan .
it would have helped if we' d known what had become of you .
didn' t you think of writing to your mother ?
of course .
but the shame i felt of losing her money ... ... my father' s sword and pistols ....
i couldn' t tell her .
she wouldn' t care about those things .
you are her only concern .
tonight you must write her a proper letter .
tell her that you' re safe and well .
i will .
is miss brady well ?
there are only six miss bradys now .
has something happened to nora ?
she took on so about your going away ... ... that she had to console herself with a husband .
she is now mrs. john quin .
mrs. john quin ?
was there another john quin ?
no .
the same , me boy .
he recovered from his wound .
the shot you hit him with could not hurt him .
it was made of tow .
tow ?
the bradys wouldn' t let you kill 1, 500 a year out of the family .
the plan of the duel was arranged in order to get you out of the way .
the cowardly quin couldn' t be brought to marry ... ... from fear of you .
but hit him you certainly did , me lad .
with a fine thick plugget of tow .
he was so frightened , it took him an hour to come to .
are you in want of cash ?
you may draw on me .
for i got a couple of hundred from your uncle .
while that lasts , you shall never want .
it would require a great historian to explain the causes ... ... of the seven years ' war in europe ... ... to which barry' s regiment was now on it' s way .
let it suffice to say , that england and prussia were allies ... ... and at war against ... ... france , sweden , russia and austria .
barry' s first taste ofbattle ... ... was only a skirmish against a rearguard of frenchmen ... ... who occupied an orchard beside a road ... ... down which the english main force wished to pass .
though this encounter is not recorded in any history book ... ... it was memorable enough for those who took part .
i' ve only a hundred guineas left to give you ... ... for i lost the rest at cards .
kiss me , me boy , for we' il never meet again .
it is well to dream ofglorious war in a snug armchair .
it is a different thing to see it first hand .
after his friend' s death , barry' s thoughts turned from military glory ... ... to those of escaping the service ... ... to which he was tied for six years .
gentlemen talk of the age of chivalry ... ... but remember the ploughmen , poachers and pickpockets they lead .
it is with these sad instruments great warriors and kings ... ... have been doing their murderous work in the world .
barry could not have fallen into worse circumstances ... ... than those in which he found himself .
but fate did not intend he should remain long an english soldier .
an accident occurred ... ... which took him out of the service in a rather singular manner .
freddie , i hope you won' t be angry with me , but ... ... i' ve got something to tell you which you won' t be happy about .
what is it ?
first , promise me you' il keep your temper .
jonathan , don' t be an ass !
you' re making a big mystery of it .
what is going on ?
i have to go away again .
for about two weeks .
oh , god , you' re not serious ?
i am .
there' s nothing i can do about it .
where to this time ?
to bremen , carrying important despatches to prince henry .
but you promised me last time it would be never again .
i know .
and i' ve kept my part of the bargain , but ... ... pontersby insists i' m the only one who can be entrusted with the trip .
here was the opportunity to escape from the army for which he had been searching .
it was only a few miles to the area occupied by their prussian allies ... ... where this officer' s uniform and papers ... ... should allow him to travel without suspicion ... ... and to stay ahead of the news of his desertion .
then , we' il have little time together .
are you cross with me ?
damn you , i can' t stay cross with you for long .
oh , jonathan ... ... at times like this i realize how much i care for you ... ... and how empty life would be without you .
frederick !
barry was glad to see the uniforms of the prussian lnfantry .
they showed him that he was out of english occupied territory .
his intention was to make for holland ... ... almost the only neutral country in europe , in those times ... ... and thence to get a passage home , somehow .
as he rode away ... ... barry felt he was now in his proper sphere .
and determined never again to fall from the rank of a gentleman .
excuse me , miss .
yes .
good day .
good day .
do you speak english ?
i' m speaking little .
i have not eaten all day , no food .
is there an inn nearby where i might have a meal ?
no ... i don' t think so .
there is nothing to eat before grnberg .
do you live near here ?
yes .
would you ... feed me ?
i' d be happy to pay you .
i think so .
is it a boy or girl ?
a boy .
what' s his name ?
peter .
how old is he ?
he' s one year old .
where is peter' s father ?
where he is ?
yes .
in the war .
how long has he been gone ?
sorry ... i didn' t understand .
what ?
oh !
a long time .
since springtime .
it must be hard for you to be alone .
it is .
it must be dangerous for you in the war .
i' m an officer and must do my duty .
you are sometimes ... ... lonely ?
sometimes .
what did you say your name is ?
lieutenant fakenham .
no , i mean ... ... what is the name before fakenham ?
my first name ?
jonathan .
would you like ... ... to stay with me ?
for a few days , or sometimes ?
that would be very nice .
goodbye , my beautiful lischen .
goodbye , redmond .
i love you .
i love you .
look after yourself .
god be with you .
a lady who sets her heart on a lad in uniform ... ... must be prepared to change lovers pretty quickly ... ... or her life will be a sad one .
this heart of lischen' s was like many a neighboring town ... ... that had been stormed and occupied many times before barry came to invest it .
during five years of war ... ... the illustrious frederick had so exhausted the males of his kingdom ... ... that he had to employ recruiters ... ... who would commit any crime , including kidnapping ... ... to keep supplied those brilliant regiments of his with cannon fodder .
good evening , sir .
i' m captain potzdorf .
to whom have i the honour of speaking ?
good evening .
i' m lieutenant fakenham , gale' s regiment of foot .
pleased to meet you .
can we be of assistance to you ?
thank you , but i am carrying urgent despatches and must continue on my way .
and your destination ?
bremen .
then you' re obviously lost , lieutenant .
bremen is in the opposite direction .
are you sure ?
yes .
wouldn' t you know it !
my departure was so hasty that my orderly forgot to prepare proper maps .
i understand .
please , do not be offended , lieutenant ... ... but are you carrying your identity papers ?
yes , of course .
may i see them ?
of course .
thank you .
thank you , lieutenant , i hope i haven' t inconvenienced you .
not at all .
now that we are riding in the same direction ... ... may i offer you a meal and a bed for the night ... ... and a proper map for the journey ?
that' s kind of you , captain .
i' d be honoured to accept .
barry was treated with great civility ... ... and was asked questions about england .
he answered as best he could , inventing many stories .
he described the king and ministers ... ... boasted that the british ambassador in berlin was his uncle ... ... and even offered potzdorf a letter ofintroduction .
his host seemed satisfied with these stories .
but , he led barry on with a skillful combination of questions ... ... and flattery .
i know so little of your country of england ... ... except that you are the bravest nation in the world ... ... and that we are fortunate to have such allies .
lieutenant fakenham ... ... let us drink to the friendship of our two great nations .
to our two great nations .
aren' t you lucky , going to bremen tomorrow ?
i know one of the loveliest women in europe there .
would you take a letter to her ?
certainly .
by the way , to whom are you carrying your despatches ?
general williamson .
general williamson ?
general percival williamson ?
yes , the same .
this man is under arrest .
under arrest ?
captain potzdorf , sir ... ... i' m a british officer .
you' re a liar and an imposter .
you' re a deserter .
i suspected you this morning .
your lies and folly have confirmed this .
you pretend to carry despatches to a general , dead these ten months .
you say the british ambassador in berlin ... ... is your uncle , with the ridiculous name of o' grady .
now , will you join and take the bounty , or be given up ?
i volunteer .
the prussian service was worse than the english .
the life of a private soldier was frightful .
punishment was incessant .
every officer had the right to inflict it .
the gauntlet was a common penalty for minor offences .
more serious ones were punishable by mutilation or death .
at the close of the seven years ' war the army ... ... renowned for its disciplined valour , was officered by native prussians .
but it was mostly composed ... ... of men from the lowest levels of humanity ... ... hired or stolen from every nation in europe .
thus , barry fell into the worst company ... ... and was soon far advanced in the science of every kind of misconduct .
help .
get me out of here .
the colonel' s speech declared the king' s satisfaction ... ... with the conduct of the regiment at the battle ofaudorf . .. ... and with corporal barry' s bravery in rescuing captain potzdorf . .. ... which was to be rewarded with the sum of two frederick d' or .
corporal barry , eight paces forward ... ... march !
corporal barry .
you' re a gallant soldier , and evidently of good stock ... ... but you' re idle and unprincipled .
you' re a bad influence on the men .
and for all your bravery , i' m sure you' il come to no good .
i hope the colonel is mistaken .
i have fallen into bad company , but i' ve only done as other soldiers do .
i' ve never had a friend or protector before ... ... to show that i was worthy of better things .
the colonel may say i' m ruined , and send me to the devil .
but , i would go to the devil to serve the regiment .
corporal barry , fall in .
the war ended and barry' s regiment was garrisoned in the capital .
he had , for some time , ingratiated himself with captain potzdorf . ..
... whose confidence in him was about to bring its reward .
good morning , redmond .
good morning , captain .
i should like you to meet my uncle , the minister of police .
good morning , herr minister .
redmond ... ... i' ve spoken to the minister regarding your services and your fortune is made .
we shall get you out of the army ... ... appoint you to the police bureau , and , in time ... ... we' il allow you to move in a better sphere .
thank you , captain .
your loyalty to me and service to the regiment has pleased me .
now there is another occasion on which you can assist us .
if you succeed ... ... your reward will be secure .
i' il do my best , sir .
there is a gentleman in berlin in the service of the empress of austria .
he calls himself the chevalier de balibari .
he appears to be a professional gambler .
fond of women , of good food ... ... polished , obliging .
he speaks french and german indifferently .
but we have reason to fancy that monsieur de balibari ... ... is a native of your country of lreland .
and that he has come here as a spy .
your knowledge of english ... ... makes you an ideal choice to go into his service ... ... and find out whether or not he is a spy .
does this assignment interest you ?
minister , i' m interested in anything that can be of service to you ... ... and captain potzdorf .
you will not know a word of english .
if the chevalier remarks on your accent , say you are hungarian .
you served in the war .
you left the army for medical reasons ... ... then served monsieur de quellenberg for two years .
he' s now with the army in silesia , but you' il have a certificate from him .
good morning , your honour .
so you are the young man recommended by seebach .
yes , your honour , here are my credentials .
your name is lazlo zilagy ?
yes , your honour .
monsieur de quellenberg recommends you highly .
monsieur is a very good man .
it was imprudent of him ... ... but when barry saw the chevalier' s splendour ... ... and noble manner ... ... he felt unable to keep disguise with him .
those who have never been exiled ... ... know not what it is to hear a friendly voice in captivity ... ... and would not understand the cause ... ... of the burst of feeling now about to take place .
you seem the right one to me .
thank you , your honour .
are you ill ?
sir ... ... i have a confession to make to you .
i' m an lrishman .
my name is redmond barry .
i was abducted into the prussian army .
now i' ve been put into your service ... ... by my captain potzdorf and his uncle , the minister of police ...
... to serve as a watch upon your ... actions ... ... and to give information to them .
the chevalier was much affected at thus finding one of his countrymen .
for he too was an exile .
and a friendly voice , a look ... ... brought the old country back to his memory .
he is very religious and attends church regularly .
after mass he comes home for breakfast .
he then takes an airing in his carriage .
barry presented his reports regularly to the minister .
the details were arranged beforehand with the chevalier .
he was instructed to tell the truth ... ... as much as his story would possibly bear .
the information he gave was very minute and accurate ... ... though not very important .
wine or punch , your honour ?
wine .
it was agreed that barry should keep his character of valet .
that , before strangers , he should not know a word of english .
and that he should keep a lookout on the trumps when serving the wine .
having excellent eyesight ... ... and a natural aptitude ... ... he was able to give his dear patron much assistance ... ... against his opponents at the green table .
if , for instance , he wiped the table with a napkin ... ... the enemy was strong in diamonds .
if he adjusted a chair it meant ace king .
if he said , " punch or wine , my lord ? " ... ... hearts were meant , and so forth .
the prince of tbingen ... ... who had intimate connections with the great frederick ... ... was passionately fond ofplay as were the gentlemen ... ... of almost all the courts of europe .
you owe 15, 500 frederick d' or .
chevalier ...
... though i cannot say how ... ... i believe you have cheated me .
i deny your grace' s accusation ... ... and beg you to say how you have been cheated .
i don' t know .
but i believe i have been .
your grace owes me 15, 500 frederick d' or ... ... which i have honourably won .
chevalier ... ... if you will have your money now you must fight for it .
if you will be patient ... ... maybe i will pay you something another time .
your grace , if i am to be so tame as to take this ... ... then i must give up an honourable and lucrative occupation .
i have said all there is to be said .
i am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish .
good night .
was the prince cheated ?
in as far as i am able to tell , herr minister , no .
i believe he won the money fairly .
what are the chevalier' s intentions ?
i' m not sure .
the prince told him that if he wanted his money he' d have to fight for it .
a meeting with the prince is impossible .
the prince has left him no other choice .
will you be able to return here tomorrow without arousing suspicion ?
i know they won' t allow a meeting with the prince .
but if i say that , do you know any reason why he' il pay me what he owes ?
you must tell them i intend to demand satisfaction .
don' t look so downcast , my boy .
they cannot harm me , the austrian embassy will see to that .
the worst they can do is send me out of this dreary country of theirs .
if they should , don' t worry ... ... you shall not be left behind .
have no fear of that .
the king has determined to send the chevalier out of the country .
has he already demanded satisfaction ?
not yet , but i believe he intends to ... ... possibly today .
then this must be done tomorrow .
all the arrangements are made .
you said he takes a drive after breakfast every day .
yes , sir .
is there any reason he should do any different tomorrow ?
no , sir .
good .
when the chevalier comes out to his carriage in the morning ... ... two officers will meet him and escort him to the frontier .
his baggage will be sent after him .
excellent .
at ten o' clock the next morning ... ... the chevalier de balibari ... ... went out for his regular morning drive .
where' s my servant , lazlo ?
i will let down the steps , your honour .
what is this about ?
please get inside .
am i under arrest ?
we' re driving to the frontier .
frontier ?
but i' m on my way to the austrian ambassador' s house .
my orders are to escort you to the frontier ... ... and see you safely across the border .
but , i' m not going to the frontier .
i have very important business at the austrian ambassador' s house .
my orders are to take your honour to the frontier by any means necessary .
if you come willingly ... ... i' m to give you this purse on behalf of the prince of tbingen ... ... containing 2, 000 frederick d' or .
all europe shall hear of this .
and so , without papers or passport ... ... and under the eyes of two prussian officers ... ... barry was escorted across the frontier into saxony and freedom .
the chevalier himself had uneventfully crossed the frontier the night before .
by these wonderful circumstances , barry was once more free ... ... and began his professional work as a gamester ... ... resolving , thenceforward and forever , to live the life of a gentleman .
the four wins .
soon he and the chevalier were received in all the courts of europe ... ... and were speedily ... ... in the very best society where play was patronized ... ... and professors of that science always welcome .
the seven .
why not the seven ?
all ... all , yes .
no more bets .
number seven ... ... loses .
place your bets .
chevalier , will you give me credit for 5, 000 louis d' or , please ?
of course , lord ludd .
five thousand .
now , everything on the four .
yes , i know , everything on the four .
no more bets .
the four loses .
it is not important .
now , i' m weary .
i would like dinner .
shall we ?
excuse me , lord ludd .
if you don' t mind .
not at all .
they always played on credit with any person of honour or noble lineage .
they never pressed for their winnings ... ... or declined to receive promissory notes .
but woe to the man who did not pay when the note became due .
barry was sure to wait upon him with his bill .
there were few bad debts .
saluez .
it was barry' s skill with the sword , and readiness to use it ... ... that maintained the reputation of the firm , so to speak .
on guard !
i will pay you today , sir .
thus , it will be seen , their life ... ... for all its splendour , was not without danger and difficulty ... ... requiring talent and determination for success .
and required them to live a wandering and disconnected life .
and , though they were swimming upon the high tide of fortune ... ... and prospering with the cards , they had little to show for their labour ... ... but some fine clothes and a few trinkets .
