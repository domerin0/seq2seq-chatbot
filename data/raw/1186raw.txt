what' s that ?
miss arizona' s number .
you couldn' t tell me earlier ?
no .
what do we got ?
i' m okay .
excuse me .
would you mind ?
hart !
hart !
sorry , sir .
let' s not make a bad day worse .
sir ... ... about the bank , i don' t know what happened .
it was like my high school reunion , except these people liked me .
well , i think we can all agree it didn' t go according to plan .
but i wanna talk to you about something else .
this is some fan mail we' ve gotten for you since the pageant .
letters , cards , chocolates .
i' il take the chocolates .
dear miss hart , i saw you on the pageant ... ... and the next night i was coming out of a party ... ... when this horrible guy grabbed me in the parking lot .
so i did your slng self defense , and he totally backed off .
i' ve gone through some tough times lately , and you have no idea what it means ... ... to feel like you can stand up for yourself again .
i just wanted to say thank you and you look beautiful in your e ...
evening gown ?
evening gown .
she liked it ?
lori , newark .
sir , you' re reading my mail .
that' s a class b misdemeanor .
hart , i' ve been getting five calls a day for you to be on talk shows .
the bureau' s had some bad publicity lately ... ... and the director thinks you could be the new face of the fbl .
sir , i' m just a field agent .
most field agents don' t have the president calling them at home to congratulate them .
i can' t believe i hung up on him .
i thought it was clonsky .
this is important , hart .
go home , have a nice dinner ... ... and think about it .
well ... ... i could use a nice dinner , sir .
i' il think about it .
hart .
well , hello , agent matthews .
no , i' m just putting the finishing touches on your chicken potpie .
yeah .
i think i' m gonna make some man very , very happy someday .
listen , i wanna ask you something .
do you know if the poconos are in new york or pennsylvania ?
because i cannot seem to get a clear answer on this .
because i was thinking that maybe this weekend ... ... we could take a little drive down there , do a little exploring , do ...
why , aren' t ... ?
why do you wanna talk tomorrow ?
i mean , aren' t you gonna be here in 10 minutes ?
oh , well , i thought we were moving at kind of a normal speed .
i ...
well , i don' t need any more space .
i mean ...
you know , it' s not like i expect us to get married or anything , but i ...
well , what is it ?
i mean , is it ... ?
is it the way i snort ?
i mean , because i don' t have to snort .
or is it the ... ?
is it the sex ?
because ...
you know , i could ...
i could get a manual or something .
well , no .
no , you don' t have to explain .
no .
no , you know what ?
you know what ?
i have to ...
i have to go .
don' t worry about dinner .
i ...
mrs. flammenbaum next door invited me to a surprise ... ... keg party .
you know what ?
i have to go .
okay .
bye .
this is where the health plan kicks in .
you ain' t kidding .
morning , sir .
hey .
i' d really like to talk to you for a minute , if i could .
hart , have you been crying ?
no .
no .
i don' t cry .
i don' t even have tear ducts .
sam fuller .
transferred in from chicago last week ... ... because of anger management problems .
really ?
she seems like such a people person .
i' ve been giving this a lot of thought ... ... and given the fact that going out on ops has become problematic in light of ... ... the bank thing ...
well , i have decided to become the new face of the fbl .
i really wanna be there and support the bureau ... ... and be a positive role model for women .
i feel like this is a great ti ...
oh , yeah .
no way you could' ve seen me standing there .
sorry .
you were saying ?
hey !
yo !
how about a real " sorry , " huh ?
come again ?
you heard me .
this is gonna be great .
i said , how about a real " sorry " ?
you are about to feel some real pain if you don' t back off .
hey , you know what ?
don' t talk to me about pain , sister .
i invented pain .
no , you didn' t just call me sister .
i don' t recall seeing a little , skinny ass white girl at the table growing up .
hey !
first of all , thank you for calling me skinny .
second of all , what is your problem ?
and third of all , you better apologize to me or ...
make me !
you know , i don' t make trash .
come on !
come on .
knock it off , fuller .
take a shower .
that' s right , take a shower .
walk away .
you lucky you still can walk !
you want more ?
take a shower .
go on .
come here .
that' s right , go on .
keep walking .
hart .
you were saying ?
oh , a positive role model for women , sir .
i want you to talk to someone before we schedule any appearances .
someone who can help with personal presentation issues .
clothing , makeup , so forth .
he comes very highly recommended .
i just went through a makeover for the pageant .
i' m still getting hairspray off my butt .
what ?
it prevents the bathing suit from riding up .
thank you .
sir , i just don' t wanna become fbi barbie again .
what' s your option ?
you can' t go in the field without putting yourself and agents in jeopardy .
that part of your life is over .
sir , it can' t be .
that' s all that i know how to do .
that' s all that i have .
you gotta make a choice .
sit at a desk pushing papers ... ... or be out there boosting the bureau' s image ?
look , when you make up your mind , let me know .
rachel , did those transfer papers for matthews come through ?
on your desk , sir .
sir , is agent matthews going someplace ?
miami .
he' s gonna be assistant sac .
going to the top , that boy .
sir .
sorry .
you know , i' il meet whoever you want me to meet .
good .
oh , i hope she' s not a fatty .
joel myers , gracie hart .
oh , yes .
yes .
i can work with this .
you will be my mona lisa , my sistine chapel .
i will find the sculpture in the stone .
slow down , da vinci .
how do you feel about a pushup bra ?
how do you feel about a genital shocking taser gun ?
i' m open to it .
okay .
are you open to new experiences , like becoming the face of the fbl ?
i did the pageant , i can do this .
that was three days .
this is your life .
that was teaching a dog a few new tricks .
this is teaching a dog to become a butterfly .
not that you' re a dog .
they generally have smoother hair .
look , just ...
you know , just tell me what you want me to do , and i' il do it .
rule number one , no hitting .
what ?
the face of the fbi uses her words , not her fists or a chair .
rule number two , chew with your mouth closed .
you don' t know how i eat .
you have ketchup stains all over you .
how did they get there if they didn' t fall from an open orifice ?
i don' t know .
maybe i walked under a ketchup tree .
rule number three , no snorting .
why don' t you just take the list .
and i truly believe you are capable of great class and style .
and , may i say , i also recently went through a breakup .
i didn' t go through a breakup .
puffy eyes , no sleep , irritable .
and some of the other agents told me about it .
but believe me , you do as i say , and you will make him regret it ... ... because people care about people who care about themselves .
so it' s all in here ?
no , it' s all in here .
america wants a star .
so you have to become a star .
you have to dress and treat your friends like you' re a star .
you have to treat yourself like a star .
before you ...
i know , i know .
i' m a big star !
our next guest was the runner up at last year' s miss united states pageant .
we found out she was actually an fbi agent ... ... on a mission to thwart an attack on the pageant .
you can read about it in her new book ... ... from misdemeanors to miss congeniality .
here' s agent gracie hart .
hi , gracie .
regis .
good to see you .
joy .
how are you ?
what a great suit .
thank you , and you look fabulous .
thank you .
this is not how i picture an fbi agent .
you don' t look anything like j. edgar hoover .
oh , really ?
because this is his dress .
listen , i watched the pageant ...
i bet you did , regis .
every year , actually .
it' s embarrassing .
my favorite part was the women' s self defense thing , you know ?
could you give us an encore ?
actually , i don' t do that anymore .
i have someone who does it for me .
so , if i could , i' d like to bring out a little friend of mine , agent sam fuller ... ... who will be helping us with the demonstration .
here she is .
so , regis , if we could have you come over to the mat .
fuller .
stand right here with fuller in front of you .
all right , regis , grab her .
she looks angry .
do i have to grab her ?
go ahead .
she has no place else to be .
all right , ladies , if you' il please remember , the word is " slng . " solar plexus ... ... instep ... ... nose ... ... and groin .
not the groin !
no !
very nice .
thank you , agent fuller .
come on , regis , let' s get you up .
thanks , gracie .
and as a special treat for knocking my husband around ... ... i have a little surprise for you .
i think you know these people .
here' s cheryl frazier , miss united states , and stan fields , host of the pageant .
it' s you !
i love your lipstick .
you do ?
stila made it for me .
they named it after me .
it' s called gracie .
that makes sense .
you did something to your hair .
just a couple of highlights .
a couple ?
okay , okay ... ... miss i' il never grow my bangs out because it' il make my face too long .
i feel we should all be sitting under dryers .
that' s what happens when best friends get together .
wish we could have invited my best friend , roger coleman ... ... but he got hit by a goodwill truck last week .
really ?
don' t we have a commercial coming up ?
please .
it' s so good to see you .
it' s so good to see you .
i ...
gracie , i' m sorry to interrupt .
we have another taping .
oh , cheryl , joel myers , my stylist .
miss united states , such a joy to meet you .
this is my hair assistant , janine .
a pleasure .
and on makeup and bass guitar , pam .
your majesty .
and you' re having a bad crown day .
excuse me , private conversation in progress .
ticktock .
okay .
i' m sorry i haven' t called in a while .
don' t apologize .
we' il have plenty of time to talk once i' m de queened .
oh , that sounds painful .
oh , i really miss you .
and eric .
oh , well ... ... actually eric and i aren' t eric and i anymore .
what ?
since when ?
oh , just 10 months .
ten months ?
yeah , i didn' t wanna bother you .
you' re busy , i' m busy .
i didn' t wanna call and say , " we broke up . " it' s no big deal .
miss hart ?
my daughter would love your john hancock .
what' s her name ?
lauren .
lauren .
so , what happened ?
oh , i just had to end it because he was getting , you know , really clingy .
yeah , but i' m fine .
i' m good .
i' m great .
we need to get to live at 5 for a wrestling demonstration ... ... then there' s a cocktail party at your publisher' s apartment .
i could go for a little tanning time .
you' re gonna go for a little unemployment time in about two seconds .
could you be a sweetheart and get me a starbucks ?
i am dying for an iced venti caramel macchiato .
get yourself a little something too .
let me tell you when i' m gonna get you an iced venti caramel macchiato .
when they elect a black woman president of the daughters of the american revolution .
okay .
and if that happens , i' d also like one of those little muffins .
where would you like it ?
fuller , i' m sensing a little subtle hostility , and i think we should talk about it .
fuller , you shouldn' t keep things bottled up .
fuller !
what is your problem ?
the problem is , i don' t like you .
why don' t you quit .
i let you have this job as a favor to mcdonald ... ... because no one outside of the canine unit would work with you ... ... because of your little attitude problem .
you know what ?
i' m out of here .
wait .
are you still going to starbucks ?
go !
no one beats my little bro !
let' s go , let' s go , pay up .
come on , pay up .
come on , who' s next ?
let' s get the bets on the table because ...
yeah ?
is he there ?
yeah , he' s here .
well , has he got my money ?
hold on , i' il ask .
excuse me , highlander , you owe mr. grant 500 bucks .
you got it ?
get lost .
he says he doesn' t have it , mr. grant .
okay !
okay !
he seems to have discovered some cash , mr. grant .
good .
all right , i got another one for you boys .
who' s the mark ?
this is gonna be one for your scrapbook .
thank you very much .
your name , please ?
octavia .
i was wondering if you could tell me what skin care regimen you use .
well , i like to catch as many felons as possible .
it really gets the heart pumping , and the increased circulation helps my complexion .
there you go .
thank you very much .
thank you .
hey .
hey .
your name , please ?
priscilla .
priscilla .
i have to do a book report .
and i wanna do it on your book because i wanna be an agent too .
oh , well , good for you .
thank you , priscilla .
hi .
your name is ?
angela .
the other kids are doing their report on beyonc or britney ... ... but if you come to my school and talk , they' d see why being an agent is so cool ... ... and stop getting on me .
i would really love to ... ... but as you can see , the agency' s got me pretty busy .
there you go .
thank you .
what you could do is pull your hair up once in a while .
it would open up your face ... ... because remember , people care about people who care about themselves .
okay .
hi .
your name is ?
jason .
jason .
if you change your mind , it' s p. s. 31 , priscilla , miss gordan' s class .
got it .
thank you very much .
your name , please ?
james .
wait !

i can retain enormous amounts of information .
p. s. 31 , priscilla , miss gordan' s class .
see ?
and don' t forget the hair tip .
try some bows .
there you go .
thank you .
nice to meet you .
and sorry to hear what happened to miss united states .
what happened ?
cheryl frazier was last seen outside this las vegas senior citizen home ... ... accompanied by longtime pageant host , stan fields .
the two were walking to a limo after a goodwill mission ... ... visiting the residents here .
apparently , miss united states and emcee fields were forced into a truck ...
are they hurt ?
are they alive ?
what demands have been made ?
that' s all we know .
you' il find out more when you get to vegas .
the director wants you to handle publicity on this .
public sees you on tv , they' il feel reassured .
absolutely , whatever i can do to help .
get your beauty team assembled immediately .
the jet leaves at 0800 .
i want you to have a bodyguard out of new york .
they' re strapped in vegas .
sir , why do i need a bodyguard ?
crowd control .
you' re gonna be the hottest celebrity in vegas .
assuming wayne newton isn' t in town .
oh , of course , sir .
danke schoen .
fuller !
i want you on a plane to vegas with hart .
she' s gonna do publicity on the cheryl frazier kidnapping .
not going .
did you just refuse an order ?
i can' t take her , sir .
i' il kill her .
and i' il enjoy it .
fuller , you are this close to being gone .
nobody wants to work with you in chicago or here .
that' s fine by me .
i like to work alone .
then become a lighthouse keeper .
this is the fbl .
we like partners .
she' s a pain in the ass .
she' s conceited and ...
keep people off her .
keep her safe .
you be a good bodyguard , i' il find you a partner .
you blow this , you' re gone .
period .
and by the way , i loved you both on regis .
grant .
boys .
mr. grant .
let' s see what you got for me .
stan fields and ...
miss united states .
you know what the pageant will pay to get her back ?
millions .
so you' re saying we hold her for ransom ?
no .
i hold her for ransom , and you get a taste .
bring her to my car .
i' m a little bit hungry .
hey !
we grabbed her .
moron , you can' t handle this job .
the feds will come right down on you .
don' t call me a moron .
i got a ba in fine arts , and my brother ...
don' t call me a moron .
you were unemployed when i found you .
you couldn' t keep a job on the show in the strip .
i made that show !
it was my concept .
then suddenly they change it and tell me and lou we' re not up to their standards .
you work for me now .
lou .
i' m there .
bring me back up !
she' s yours !
she' s all yours !
let me up !
let me up .
just let me up .
oh , god , let me up .
next time , he lets go .
you guys are crazy !
now what ?
now we do exactly what he said .
we ransom her .
please be careful .
my guns are in that fendi .
thank you .
thank you .
please tell me you have tickets to see cirque du soleil .
i' m your bodyguard .
what ?
mcdonald thinks we have a bond because of our performance on regis ... ... and trl , oprah , the food network .
oh , hey , hey , we got some great recipes from that one .
the lemon chicken ?
tangy .
now , look , like all great teams , hope and crosby , fred and ginger ... ... outkast ... ... the end must come ... ... so bye bye .
let me make this simple for you , hart .
mcdonald gave me a mission ... ... so that plane does not take off unless we' re both on it .
got it ?
you might consider a tic tac .
please ... ... we' re trying to cooperate .
shut your mouth .
you can' t talk to her like that .
you trying to tell me what to do ?
no , i' m just the emcee .
i' ve heard you sing .
lucky i don' t shoot you now .
okay , let' s line this up .
and ...
i don' t have my crown .
who cares ?
i care .
fine .
thousands of women ... ... all across america care .
give her the crown .
when in public , miss united states always proudly wears her crown .
okay ?
all right , let' s go again .
one , two , action .
we' ve been kidnapped , and there' s two men here ... ... who say they' re gonna kill us by friday at midnight .
but i don' t want anyone to pay them any money .
cut !
that would be giving in to terrorism ... ... and i' m miss united states ...
cut ! ... and i stand for fairness and decency ... ... and the american way !
i said , cut !
i' d be happy to say it if you' d like .
i' ve done quite a bit of theater .
i played lago in twelfth night .
put two more choppers up .
sir .
gracie hart .
yes .
i' m walter collins .
sir .
i feel as though i' m in the presence of royalty .
oh , no , sir , i' m not queen , just runner up .
i would like to present to you agent sam fuller .
fuller .
sir .
joel myers , janine and pam .
joel , janine , pam .
why don' t we get you to the hotel while i give the agents a debriefing .
oh , that' s too bad .
it' s been months since i' ve had a good debriefing .
although , i' m really more of a boxers man .
okay , wrong audience .
agent hart , agent fuller , this is agent foreman .
he' s your liaison .
you need anything , jeff is your boy .
good .
welcome to las vegas
when my girlfriend found out that i would be working with you , she almost died .
yeah , she' s an agent too .
she actually thought that i was gonna fall for you .
i told her ...
i said , " janet , there' s no way ...
foreman , we talked about this .
sorry , sir .
anyway , you' re obviously too old for me , so ...
oh , good , well , that' s a load off .
frazier and fields make an appearance at a senior center for a program ... ... where the elderly spend time with kids .
mr. fields ' mother is there .
i think what you' re doing here ... ... shows that different generations have so much to learn from each other .
i mean , i know i learned a lot from my grandmother ... ... specifically , how to kill a chicken .
and even though it wasn' t something i enjoyed doing ... ...
i' il never forget the sound of their death squawks .
but if i had to kill a chicken , i' d know how .
they finish their appearance .
head for the limo , where they' re attacked and kidnapped .
we got this video from a surveillance camera .
all we have is two hooded figures , the make of the truck and a fake license plate .
we talked to the limo driver , but he says he didn' t see anything .
and that' s it .
these are your briefing folders .
hart , you have a press conference at your hotel at 0900 tomorrow morning .
call me if there' s any questions .
sir ?
we have to find her .
i' il find her .
i know we' re on a tight schedule ... ... but if you guys wanna see any shows , just let me know .
janet can get us tickets .
i don' t know how she does it , but she does it .
she' s really great .
expert marksman .
she bakes .
oh , almost forgot .
here are your coded id cards .
you' re gonna need these to get into the bureau .
and here are your earpieces .
we' re ...
thanks .
we' re gonna be on frequency 1145 .
sorry , that is not fbi issue .
that' s a sweater that i bought for janet for her birthday .
and that' s the hat that goes with it .
argyle .
she' s scottish .
janet mccarren .
look , i' m sorry .
i' m just really in love .
where' s the best place for me to throw up ?
well , i am thrilled for you , jeff .
because , unlike agent fuller , i , too , am carbon based .
the venetian hotel .
miss hart !
what a fantastic pleasure .
i am roberto fenice , manager of the venetian hotel .
oh , hello .
your wish is my command .
oh , well , i wish you wouldn' t kiss my watch .
it' s not water resistant .
although it' s more action than i' ve had in months , so go ahead .
miss hart , you are delicious .
mr. fenice .
hi , i' m agent foreman .
this is agent sam fuller .
oh , my gosh !

fuller !
oh , my !
fuller !

too much , too much , too much .
fuller , fuller .
fuller , i don' t think you fully understand the concept of " too much " !
hey , mcdonald told me to keep people off you .
and i don' t think grandpa' s coming back .
at least , not under his own power .
maybe we should' ve stayed at treasure island , huh ?
you don' t see that in jersey .
it' s the best .
a ships sinks , and there' s all these scantily clad sailors around .
makes me wanna join the navy .
yeah , you are just what they' re looking for .
hey , hart , you sure this suite is big enough for you ?
i can fit my entire room inside your steam shower .
feel free to move in there .
yeah , right .
right , let' s go over this schedule for tomorrow .
gracie ?
yes .
gracie , there' s something about cheryl on the tv .
we just received what appears to be a ransom video ... ... which was e mailed to our studios a few hours ago from an anonymous source .
it was sent from an unknown location .
we' ve been kidnapped .
and there' s two men here ... ... who say they' re going to kill us by friday at midnight ... ... unless they' re paid $5 million by the pageant .
once again , that' s $5 million by friday at midnight .
i can' t just sit here .
i have to do something .
i should just see ...
you should do exactly what you came here to do , hart .
press conference at 9 .

you' ve got such great ...
thank you , guys , so much for your support .
i' m here on business to talk to this man about the miss united states kidnapping .
mr. abernathy ?
yeah ?
what did you do ?
he was driving the limousine that cheryl frazier and stan fields were in ... ... the day they were kidnapped .
i wanted to know why you parked so far away from the entrance of the home .
yeah , why would you do that ?
why ?
so if i could show you something ...
well , it' s not these .
it' s not my badge .
well , what do you ... ?
it' s my deployment schedule ... ... and if you can look where it says " tomorrow' s events .
yeah , go ahead , read aloud .
" nine a . m . press conference ... ... at the venetian " ?
speak up , we cannot hear you !
he said , " 9 a . m . press conference at the venetian " ... ... where i will be in front of channels two , four ...
i mean , well , everybody' s invited .
and i will probably have to say that tom abernathy is a suspect .
why are you doing this to me ?
because i wanna find my friends .
and because you are sweating in all three stress spots ... ... that people routinely start sweating in before they undergo public humiliation .
i had it on letterman .
okay , everybody , i would love to stay and chat ... ... but i have to go pick out my outfit for the press conference .
oh , what time was that again ?
nine !
thank you .
watch the news , i' il do a little shout out .
thanks , gracie .
hey !
hey !
hold up !
hold up .
wait .
okay .
somebody came up to me the day before .
she offers me 200 bucks if i will park far away from the entrance at the home ... ... and that' s it .
that' s all i know , i swear .
she ?
what did she look like ?
oh , miss hart , would you mind ?
oh , i' m actually in a hurry .
is it true you' re seeing prince william ?
oh , i' m ...
no , we were just talking at a book party .
he' s in love with me , but i hate castles .
sorry , sorry , sorry .
hey .
let me explain something to you .
you didn' t do what was on the schedule , and i' m a schedule type person .
you missed the press conference .
i went to the bureau because i got a tip from the limo driver ... ... who said that somebody who looked like dolly parton ... ... paid him not to park in front of the senior home .
did you hear what you just said ?
yeah .
and why did you go out without clearing it with me ?
clearing it with you ?
hey , i' il bet no one' s had breakfast ...
i' m sorry , but i don' t work for you .
okay ?
you work for me , so ...
no , you didn' t just say i work for you .
you work for me .
you work for me .
shut up .
you work for me .
shut up .
fuller , i don' t have the time for this , okay ?
listen , why don' t we just get something ...
okay , look .
i am the face of the bureau .
you are here to help me be the face of the bureau , which means that you work for me .
it' s no big ...
look , hart , i am your bodyguard .
that means i need a body to guard !
you hit me , which means i could bring you up on charges .
if i could just bring myself up right now .
okay , look , i don' t work for you .
you don' t work for me .
we' re a team .
get it ?
as in " i will kick your sorry ass if you don' t listen to me " team .
if you remember correctly , it was " skinny ass .
and , second of all , what is your problem , fuller ?
do you honestly feel it' s okay to go around harassing people and bashing their faces in ?
guess what .
you will never make it in this bureau ... ... if you don' t start using your head .
you just use ...
what , you start listening to me now ?
stop it !
stop !
stop !
all right .
fuller , violence is not the answer to our problems , all right ?
it' s not .
and i' m not just saying that because i' m " scared " of you .
okay ?
because i' m ...
what is that ? !
i am calling mcdonald .
where' s joel ?
i can' t go into public like this .
hey , how are you ?
joel !
hello .
you knocked my highlights off .
what happened ?
look !
this will take an hour .
tell me about it .
misting .
ladies .
i really think we should call the networks and set up another press conference .
you know what ?
you' re absolutely right .
okay .
i' m gonna go back up to the room .
i' m gonna get a little spritz , a little refresh ...
it' s her .
it' s her .
hold this .
we are not questioning dolly .
it' s not the real dolly , so relax .
i know it' s not .
stay away from her .
okay , i' m an adult .
i can act as i please .
you leave dolly alone !
get your hands off me !
thank you very much .
excuse me , fake dolly !
hi .
hello .
fbi here .
yeah , i just would love to have a few words with you if i could .
hi , how are you ?
how you doing ?
yeah , thank you for your support .
yeah .
get off me , you stalker !
get off me !
fake dolly !
where are you going ?
hart !
fake dolly !
gracie !
stop !
hart , stop !
dolly parton !
what is it about this outfit that is making everyone so uncooperative ?
gracie hart !
blondie !
no pictures .
hold on .
excuse me .
i need for you to ...
open !
just ...
watch it !
someone stop that fake dolly !
hart , stop !
stop her !
excuse me .
excuse me .
please don' t make me do something that' s not ladylike .
okay , fbl .
i have just a few questions for you .
me first !
what is the matter with you ?
miss hart !
what are you doing ?
miss parton is here for a press conference to announce her new world tour .
there is no world tour , and this is not dolly parton .
okay , look .
look , these are absolutely ...
what are you ... ?
what is she doing ?
that hurts !
why did you run ?
some crazy woman was chasing me !
excuse me , excuse me .
miss parton , " here you come again " was my wedding song .
i just love you .
honey , let' s leave miss parton alone .
i love that song too .
that was an amazing song !
why are you on top of me ?
i' m just a big fan .
it' s also on cnn ... ... msnbc ... ... and al jazeera .
i was trying to question her regarding ...
you really think you' re something special .
i have got 75 people working on this case day and night ... ... and they don' t stack up to you , do they ?
the limo driver ...
i want you off this case .
well , i am sorry , sir , but you don' t have the authority to kick me off this case .
i could call the director , who happens to be a close , personal friend .
or i could even call the president , who invited me to dinner at his house .
and i think we know which house i' m talking about , don' t we ?
it' s white .
actually , it' s eggshell , if you ...
i am the sac in las vegas .
i have authority over my territory .
and when the director sees you on national television ... ... nose tackling his favorite country western singer , he will back me up .
now , i want the two of you on a jet back to new york today .
do you think you can handle that tiny , little task , foreman ?
of course , sir .
okay .
i got you the last three seats on the flight .
janine , pam , you have to take the next one .
sorry .
because we' re just hair and makeup ?
we could go to the bar .
for five hours ?
okay .
the director' s gonna call me back any minute .
good .
and when he does ... ... you can let him know that chasing dolly was all your dumb idea .
oh , really ?
well , let me ask you something , chatty cathy .
what happened to , " team , yo .
you and me in it together " ?
don' t do that again .
and that was before you ruined my career .
what ?
yeah .
mcdonald said that if i screwed this up , then i' m out of the bureau .
thanks , hart .
what are you complaining about ?
you' re not famous .
nobody knows who you are .
you' re a private failure .
but you see this ?
you see this ?
everybody knows this .
so if i screw up , i' m failure face .
well , get your failure face out of my ruined career face ... ... because right now i' m mad , and i' m pissed off and mad , so ...
oh , okay , hold on .
so you' re double mad ?
well , if you' re double mad , then i am mad , mad , mad .
all right ?
top that one .
back off !
you gotta stop hitting me ... ... because every time you do , it wrinkles !
ladies , ladies !
calm down .
sit down .
sit down .
i' m gonna separate the two of you .
mad , mad , mad , mad .
four .
i can still shoot her from here .
you have to lean over me to get to her .
now , let' s calm down and try to focus on the positive .
we have our health .
you' il be getting frequent flyer miles .
foreman , what did you just say ?
frequent flyer miles .
it' s a great way to get upgrades .
no , you said that she ...
you said that she would have to lean over you to get to me .
look at what the kidnappers are doing .
this guy is leaning over cheryl to get to stan .
why would they do that if they were after cheryl ?
okay , and look at this .
look at this .
they' re not even touching her .
no , she' s just stuck in there , like a little cheryl sandwich .
she' s ...
she' s ...
oh , my god .
she is grabbing them .
i taught her that wristlock .
she' s not defending herself .
she' s ...
she' s defending stan .
maybe they weren' t after cheryl .
maybe they were after stan .
the man can' t sing , but is that a crime ?
that' s what we' re gonna find out .
hey , look , they' re boarding .
let it go , hart .
oh , fuller , come on .
wake up and smell the iced venti caramel macchiato .
you know i' m onto something .
okay .
tell collins .
we have issues .
he won' t listen to me .
and you think i am ?
yes .
yes , i do .
you know , you don' t get your miles unless you' re actually on the flight , so come on .
you' re on your own , hart .
no , i' m not .
because even though you refuse to dress up or separate those eyebrows ... ... you cannot deny that you have a style .
gray suit , white shirt , masculine shoes .
you are an fbi agent .
and that is all that you have .
and like you said , if you go back there now , you are out of the bureau .
now boarding all rows on flight 624 to new york .
fuller , i am begging you .
do you have any idea how painful this is for me ?
usually , they give an epidural for this kind of agony .
fuller , please , just ...
just , please .
hart , you better be right , or i swear ...
you' re gonna kick my skinny white ass and break my face .
i know .
i already paid for the seats , and i don' t get reimbursed unless you' re on the flight .
i' m letting you spend the night because i wanna keep my eyes on you .
tomorrow , you guys are on a flight .
okay , as soon as we go to the home .
whose home ?
where stan fields ' mother lives .
she was the last person to see him .
maybe she knows something .
you' re supposed to be in new york .
you' re famous .
everyone there will recognize you .
not to worry .
joel will come up with something to make us blend .
he' s a born blender .
i don' t believe this .
you guys are lucky that janet had to work late ... ... because if she was here , she would not put up with any of this .
now , janet ...
janet runs a tight ship .
i love shopping in vegas .
where else can you find a 24 hour wiggery ?
well , to work .
hey , hey !
that' s my room !
hey !
hey !
i never would have suspected .
what ?
you as a dainty travel pillow type .
it' s hypoallergenic .
oh , really ?
and what are you allergic to ?
besides you ?
shellfish , cats , dogs , any type of animal dander ... ... dairy products , dust ...
you should be in a plastic bubble .
plastic .
that explains it .
explains what ?
why you' re so angry .
i' m not angry , i' m allergic .
all i was saying was that it just , you know ... ... couldn' t have been easy being a kid sick like that all the time .
i mean , not being able to have a dog or a cat or ice cream or dust .
it wasn' t bad .
really ?
i got to hang out with my dad a lot .
he was a sportswriter , so we got to watch all the games on tv together ... ... and he taught me how to box .
taught me how to take care of myself .
well , i' m sure he was very proud of you .
was ?
yeah , i read on your file that he died before you became an agent .
you read my file ?
i had to make sure you weren' t crazy .
yeah .
turns out you can' t trust a file .
yeah , well , i guess you can' t .
i thought i would' ve liked a tough tomboy from jersey whose mom was an agent .
you read my file ?
worse .
your book .
had to make sure you weren' t crazy .
turns out you can' t trust a book .
yeah , they brought in this writer ... ... who managed to turn the entire story into some fairy tale .
in the first draft , he made it sound like my mother died ... ... single handedly saving the country , when all it was was just , you know , a ...
it was just a drug bust gone bad .
sorry .
sorry about your dad .
but i' m mostly sorry you had to read that book .
i like the pictures , though .
oh , really ?
yeah , especially that one with that guy .
what was his name ?
which one ?
the agent , the one that was in the pageant with you .
eric matthews .
yeah .
he was hot .
i guess .
night , hart .
good night , fuller .
foreman , we' re in .
approaching target .

i mean , who would wanna hurt him ?
well , you know , he loved the sluts .
he loved the sluts ?
the sluts !
the sluts .
the slut machines .
slot machines .
when he wasn' t doing that pageant , he was here in vegas , gambling .
i don' t know where he gets that from .
so you were saying ...
you were saying that your son , he loves the slot machines .
i begged him to stop .
one of these days , gambling' s gonna get you in a lot of trouble .
i lent him 600 bucks , i never got it back .
i was ready to break his legs , and i' m his mother .

they' re lovely , but they fall apart all the time .
i' m grabbing your luggage .
we' re going to the airport .
didn' t you hear what stan' s mother said ?
yes , i did .
sluts .
i wrote it down , all right ?
loan shark . " that' s why we have to get back to the bureau ... ... do a chc printout of every loan shark in vegas .
you can' t go to the bureau .
you are supposed to be in new york .
and that is why you can go and you can take ...
no !
no !
okay , look , jeff ... ... i don' t like to use my gun unless it' s in self defense or at a really good sale ... ... but if you don' t go back and get those chcs , i have to ...
you know , i have to shoot you .
you won' t do it , gracie .
this is what i like .
learning to work together .
a little " ebony & lvory " action .
guys , i can' t do it .
stop being a wuss , foreman .
be a man !
yeah , like fuller .
okay .
but this is it .
then we' re going to the airport .
enough' s enough .
absolutely .
okay .
i' m putting my foot down .
he' s putting his foot down .
got some high def tapes for the new ransom video .
more production value .
bro ... ... maybe we should get out now .
are you kidding ?
we got them where we want them .
they' re getting nervous .
but if they don' t agree to our demands , we ...
that' s why we' re making a new one .
we' re gonna have miss united states say we' re moving up the deadline .
and either we get our cash wired to an offshore account tonight , or she' s dead .
so , what do we do ?
shoot them ?
no .
we' re gonna kill them and get a little payback at the hotel .
you know how location is everything in vegas , right ?
well , after we pull this off , treasure island' s gonna be a big , ugly crime site .
what , are we just gonna drive in ?
no .
just before the show starts , we' il tie them up at the bottom of the boat .
that ship sinks , so long , miss united states .
hey , guys .
foreman .
nice job with dolly parton .
yeah .
we' ve been after dolly for a long time , but it took you to finally bring her in .
i can' t do this .
yes , you can .
remember what louis vuitton said , " it' s in the bag . " you can do this .
okay .
he can' t do this .
going down like a fat woman on a greased fire pole .
i heard that .
i' m going into the database .
great .
just keep us filled in .
okay .
someone left a can of soda by the keyboard .
i' m sweating profusely .
i think i left my oven on .
we' re printing .
awesome , jeff .
awesome .
you did it .
fuller just lost a bet .
not over yet .
agent collins , if you could just answer a ...
agent collins !
all right , this is gonna be the last question .
yes , go ahead .
what happens if tomorrow' s deadline comes and goes ... ... and there' s no break in the case ?
we' ve spoken with the pageant administration .
we will not negotiate .
they have one choice , and that is to free miss frazier and mr. fields , and that' s it .
no more questions .
thank you .
just one more question !
that' s not right .
what' s not right ?
no .
it must be the height .
jeff .
jeff , what' s up ?
what' s up ?
it' s janet .
i' m not sure , but i think she' s with ...
with what ?
with you ?
withholding evidence ?
with child ?
with what ?
with what ? !
with collins .
foreman !
foreman .
what are you doing with chcs ?
they' re for the miss united states case .
what about that case ?
were the two of you just ... ?
jeff , chill !
okay , you' ve just gotta get out of there .
foreman , why do you have those rap sheets ?
a general database check to see if there were any suspects worth pursuing .
i was doing a general database check to see if there were any suspects worth pursuing .
were you two just ... ?
this isn' t a general database check .
this is a felony specific search for loan sharks .
say you noticed on the kidnapping video ... ... the assailants were attempting to abduct stan fields .
foreman , i want an answer .
say it again .
i want an answer .
on the kidnapping video , the assailants ...
what is wrong with you ?
say it faster .
what' s wrong with you ?
the assailants were attempting to abduct stan fields ... ... and you found out that stan fields had a gambling problem .
water .
i saw the assailants attempting to abduct stan fields ... ... so i pursued the matter and found out he has a gambling problem .
you pursued the matter further ?
under whose authority ?
you' ve gotta lie , foreman .
foreman , i am waiting .
tell him that i' m dizzy from smashing a suspect' s head into the wall ... ... and i can' t remember .
that always works .
you know what i like to do ?
faint .
we can' t do this , guys .
he' s honest .
jeff , tell him the truth .
the truth ?
are you sure ?
am i sure i want the truth ?
foreman , i want you to get a cat scan .
i didn' t get this information .
agents hart and fuller did .
how ?
they' re in new york .
well , at the airport ...
they' re not in new york .
hart ?
yes , sir .
i assume that agent fuller is with you .
yes , sir .
and joel .
hello , walter .
i want all of you in the situation room now .
that is exactly what i want .
that' s right .
sir .
i want you to know that none of this was agent foreman' s idea .
oh , i know , i know .
because foreman doesn' t have any ideas .
this has you written all over it , hart .
you' ve really gotta do things your way , don' t you ?
dolce and gabbana always said we should express our own personal style , sir .
they were talking about a vest ...
you' re no super agent .
you' re just a loose cannon who lucked into being in the right place at the right time .
you don' t have to be that hard on her .
she was ...
oh , i am so glad you' re with her on this , fuller ... ... because you two are going down together .
the works .
review board , departmental hearings ...
sir , we got another message e mailed .
show me .
play it .
this is cheryl frazier .
hi , again .
the deadline has been changed .
it' s not tomorrow , it' s tonight .
the kidnappers are going to fax instructions to the pageant ... ... where the 5 million should be sent .
and if they don' t receive it , i' m going to be dead .
and i know it' s a lot of money , but it' s my booty on the line .
so ...
this is stan fields ... ... and she' s too young to die .
and i' m not as old as i look .
so please .
we also got this , sir .
a clerk at a print store saw a suspicious man e mail a message about an hour ago .
aerial spotted a pickup truck matching the vehicle in the kidnapping video ... ... heading south on 15 .
you see this ?
this is real information .
not dolly parton and senior homes .
that' s how we do it in vegas .
i want roadblocks on i 15 and increased surveillance at the airports .
foreman ?
yes , sir .
i want you to put agents hart , fuller and joel on the first flight back to new york .
to make sure there' s no problem , okun and hills will be going with you .
and if you get it wrong this time , you are fired .
do you copy ?
that won' t be necessary , because nobody is getting fired , and nobody is leaving .
wrong again , hart !
and if i ever see you in my city again , you can forget about the review board .
i will have you arrested for obstruction of justice ... ... and you can spend a very long time in las vegas , in a jail cell .
i have really had just about enough of your rudeness and insensitivity and cologne .
oh , really ?
and what are you gonna do about it ?
call the director ?
go ahead .
i got off the phone with him .
know what he said ?
he said that you are the biggest mistake he ever made .
and he said , and i quote ... ... that you " have become a liability and an embarrassment to the bureau .
now , get going .
okun .
it' s collins .
yes , sir , we' re at the airport .
is he mad at me ?
sorry , sir , i' m losing you .
does he wanna talk to me ?
foreman !
leave him alone !
now boarding , flight 624 to new york .
yeah .
i was looking at your ad ... ... and i was wondering if you have a dolly parton performer .
no ?
okay .
hart , maybe you were right about dolly .
maybe you just had the wrong dolly .
you don' t know if they have a dolly .
they don' t .
i just called there , and they said the only place in vegas ... ... that has a dolly parton performer is the oasis drag club .
just get on the plane , fuller .
do you wanna save cheryl or not ?
i' m gonna get her killed .
what' s up with you ?
what happened to that girl from the pageant ?
she' s gone .
her boyfriend , eric matthews , broke up with her , and it was absolutely devastating .
is that what happened to you ?
oh , that' s pathetic .
come on .
plenty of guys have broken up with me .
you just beat them up and move on .
only you and foreman turn it into some big soap opera .
well .
of course you don' t understand how jeff feels , because he' s not a cyborg .
he knows what it feels like to be rejected and humiliated .
to feel your heart ripped open ... ... because you finally took a chance on that relationship ... ... and it wound up confirming your worst fears ... ... that you are worthless and not worth caring about .
so you may not understand , but that is how jeff feels .
matthews was right to dump you .
take that back .
i would say , " make me , " but you can' t .
okay .
all right .
well ... ... then i just have two things to say .
what ?
first of all , we are in a public place ... ... so we have to display a sense of decorum , and second of all ... ... i might break a nail .
take it back !
take it back .
jeez !
all the stuff that collins said back there was a bunch of bull .
you figured out the limo driver was dirty .
you figured out that they were after stan .
you' re not lucky .
you' re good .
thank you .
but take it back , take it back , take it back .
okay , i' il take it back .
i' il take it back if you admit one thing .
oh , god !
for the first time in a long time , you feel like the real gracie hart .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
straining muscles cutting off someone' s air supply .
sweating like a pig .
you' re right , i feel like a woman again .
good .
i take it back .
now release .
you first .
on three .
one .
two .
three .
oh , no .
okay , just to show you i trust you .
now boarding all passengers for flight 624 to new york .

i can' t afford therapy on my salary .

you can do this .
okay , you can because you are sam fuller , fbl ... ... and nothing scares you .
i am gracie hart ... ... and at this moment , i am also big bird , and nothing scares me ... ... except losing cheryl because having a friend like her , having any friend , for me ... ... is a really , really rare thing , okay ?

how are we gonna get out of here ?
i don' t know , but it has to be subtle .
ladies and gentlemen , the next show will be in 20 minutes .
okay , let' s go .
you both keep your mouths shut , or you' re dead .
the steele brothers were fired from the treasure island show .
cheryl said something about her booty being on the line .
cheryl would never refer to her ass as a booty or refer to her ass , period .
she calls it a po po .

jeff .
jeff !
gracie and sam went to ...
go on , if you don' t wanna spend a few years in prison ... ... for obstruction of justice .
which prison ?
just in case i don' t get a chance to say it ... ... l' m sorry for getting on you about that whole matthews thing .
it was none of my business .
that' s all right .
i scared him off .
but the thing is , right , he came back to save me .
i mean , why would somebody come back to save someone if they didn' t have ... ... feelings ?
you know ?
i' m sure he liked you , but maybe he was just doing his job .
maybe .
men .
can' t live with them , you can' t ...
no , that' s about it .
yep .
okay , hold on .
come on !
okay !
clearly that' s not working .
