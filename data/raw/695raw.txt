when the value of the x coordinate is equal to or less than the value of ...
yes , isaac ?
what about that problem ?
why ?
i just put that up there as a joke .
that' s probably the hardest geometry equation in the world
how much extra credit is it worth ?
well , i' ve never seen anyone get it right including my mentor , dr. leaky at mlt .
i guess if anyone here can solve that problem
i' d see to it that none of you ever have to open another math book again for the rest of your lives .
max ?
you want to try it ?
i' m sorry .
did someone say my name ?
you got it
you guys have it real easy .
i never had it like this where i grew up
but i send my kids here .
because the fact is you go to one of the best schools in the country
rushmore
now , for some of you it doesn' t matter .
you were born rich , and you' re going to stay rich
but here' s my advice to the rest of you
take dead aim on the rich boys .
get them in the crosshairs
and take them down
just remember .
they can buy anything .
but they can' t buy backbone .
don' t let them forget that .
thank you .
are you free for graduation , herman ?
maybe you could give us an encore .
i don' t give a shit .
i paid for the whole damn natatorium .
the least these little pricks can do is hear me out .
hello , i' m max fischer .
i just wanted to tell you i strongly agree with your views concerning rushmore .
your speech was excellent
this is my chapel partner , dirk calloway
i really think you' re right about rushmore .
what' s his name again ?
max fisher
he' s a sharp little guy
he' s one of the worst students we' ve got
we' re putting you on what we call sudden death academic probation
and what does that entail ?
it entails that if you fail another class you are going to be asked to leave rushmore .
in other words , i' il be expelled .
that' s correct
can i see some documentation ?
too many extra curricular activities , max
i don' t want to tell you how to do your job but the fact is no matter how hard i try , i still might flunk another class
and if that means i have to stay on for a post graduate year , then so be it .
we don' t offer a post graduate year .
we don' t offer it yet .
just bring up the grades
do you remember how i got into this school ?
yes , you wrote a play
that' s right .
second grade .
a little one act about watergate
and my mother read it and felt i should go to rushmore .
you read it and you gave me a scholarship , didn' t you ?
do you regret it ?
no , i don' t regret it
but i still might have to expel you
couldn' t we just let me float by ?
for old times ' sake ?
i can' t do it , max .
they want to kick me out oh , no .
not again .
what are you going to do ?
the only thing i can do .
try and pull some strings with the administration
did you hear they' re teaching japanese next year ?
that' s the rumor
and they' re canceling latin .
what ?
i tried to get latin canceled for five years " it' s a dead language " , i' d always say
well , i guess they finally heard you .
excuse me !
could i see a list of all the people who' ve checked out this book in the past year ?
look at that
i have seen wicked men and fools , a great many of both and i believe they both get paid in the end
but the fools first
the lad with the silver button
meet me on the corner in 10 minutes where are you goin ' ?
excellent !
that' s was excellent !
i told mr. calloway the other day how fortunate we are to have someone like you looking out for dirk .
i' m just trying to impart some of the experiences i' ve accrued to help him .
this has my number on it
hello , dirk ?
hi , mom !
how' d the math test go ?
what math test ?
no .
did you turn in your paper on the berlin airlift ?
yeah , i got an extension .
so how did it go with mrs. calloway ?
we shook hands
big deal !
and i gave her my phone number
buchan said he' d have already banged her by now what ?
that' s my best friend' s mother he' s talking about
i thought that' s why you picked dirk as your chapel partner .
what are you , a lawyer ?
it' s max fisher .
oh , hi ! ...
what' s the secret , max ?
the secret ?
yeah .
you seem to have it pretty figured out
i don' t know .
i think you just gotta find something you love to do , then do it for the rest of your life
for me , it' s going to rushmore
did you invite that kid to your party ?
max fisher ?
there' s gonna be girls there .
i' d rather die pull your head out of your ass
do vidjenja .
bog , max .
vidimo se sutra .
may i see the back , please ?
that' s it thank , you
i need a signature on this geometry test
i know ... 37 % .
i don' t know what to do anymore
it could have been worse .
you almost got the a
maybe i' m spending too much of my time starting up clubs and putting on plays
that' s possible
i should probably be trying harder to score chicks .
that' s the only thing anybody really cares about .
but it' s not my forte , u
it' il happen , max .
it' s just ...
you' re like one of those clipper ship captains you' re married to the sea
yes , that' s true
but i' ve been out to sea for a long time
hello ?
hi
i like your hat oh , thank you
you' re a teacher here , aren' t you ?
and this is your first year at rushmore uh huh
how long have you been a smoker , if you don' t mind me asking ?
how old are you ?
15
since i was your age you' re kidding
you should quit you' re right
and i should mind my own business
where' d you go to school , by the way ?
harvard
really ?
that' s a coincidence .
my top schools where i want to apply to are oxford and the sorbonne .
but my safety is harvard
that' s very ambitious .
thank you
what do you want to study ?
i haven' t decided for sure .
but probably a double major in mathematics and pre med
what was your major ?
i didn' t have a major .
but my thesis was on latin american economic policy
ah , that' s interesting .
did you hear they' re not going to teach latin here anymore ?
this was more like central america
oh , central america and whatnot
but moving on , they' re gonna cancel latin .
they' ve got to make room for japanese
that' s a shame because all the romance languages are based on latin
yeah , they are nihilo sanctum estne ?
what' s that ?
that' s latin , isn' t it ?
what does that mean ?
is nothing sacred ?
glory fades i' m max fischer
sign here , please
is latin dead ?
radje ti prekini radit ' sranja .
is that latin ?
never in my wildest imagination did i ever dream i would have sons like this
what does your dad do , max
he' s a neurosurgeon at st. joseph' s hospital .
personally , i could never see myself cutting open somebody' s brain .
but he seems to enjoy it
oh , no !
i got this one
you were in vietnam , if i' m not mistaken ?
yeah
you were in the shit ?
yeah , i was in the shit
what' s on sunday ?
oh , that' s right .
the twin' s birthday party
do you wanna come ?
i' d love to .
except i' ve already got previous occupations to attend to .
thanks for the invitation , though
come work for me what do you mean ?
i mean , i could use someone like you
i may not be rich , mr. blume and my father may only be a doctor but we manage 112th
excuse me , mr. blume nice talking to you
you' re on the team ?
i' m an alternate
miss cross ?
i thought i would just let you know as per our conversation the other day ...
latin ?
right .
the romance languages .
i gave a little speech
i heard about this you did ?
i understand you made a very convincing argument .
i thought you' d be pleased to hear they' re going to continue the latin program .
i' m very impressed thank you very much
you need an assistant ?
do we get to have assistants around here ?
i doubt it .
i' m on scholarship , though .
academic scholarship .
so i get to do odd jobs .
how did you decide to teach at rushmore ?
my husband went here .
i didn' t know you were married .
well , he' s dead now .
so i' m not actually
when did he die ?
last year
my mother' s dead i' m sorry to hear that
she died when i was seven .
so we both have dead people in our families .
now what' s going on in here ?
these were just born
i don' t want any alloys .
i want steel .
i don' t give a rat' s ass if he did
steel , harry
you change your mind ?
you want the job ?
no .
but i' ve got an idea .
and need some money
rushmore deserves an aquarium .
a first class aquarium where scientists can lecture and students can observe marine life in its
i don' t know .
what do you think , ernie aquarium ?
what kind of fish ?
barracudas .
stingrays .
hammerheads .
piranhas ...
piranhas ?
really ?
yes , i' m talking to a guy in south america .
what did guggenheim say ?
nothing .
i thought i should go to you first
because at this moment i feel our best strategy is to keep a low profile .
the more preparation i can do , the stronger our case will be when we take it to the administration .
how much money do you want ? $35 . 000 for the initial plans
i' il give you $2500 o. k.
thank you you' re welcome
max ?
can i ask you something ?
sure
has it ever crossed your mind that you' re way too young for me ?
it' s crossed by mind that you might consider that a possibility , yes .
not to mention you' re a student ...
i' m not trying to pressure you into anything , miss cross .
i' m surprised you brought it up so bluntly .
i just want to make sure ...
we' ve become friends , haven' t we ?
yes
and the truth is neither one of us has the slightest idea where this relationships is going .
we can' t predict the future .
we don' t have a relationship , max but we' re friends
yes .
and that' s all we' re going to be that' s what i meant by relationship .
you want me to grab a dictionary ?
i just want to make sure we understand each other i understand .
you' re not attracted to me
c' est la vie .
max .
you' re fifteen .
attraction doesn' t enter into it if you say so
all i' m getting is ...
i' ve never met anyone like you
you can take that for whatever it' s worth
i think i can safely say i' ve never met anyone like you , either
you haven' t , have you ?
you want to shake hands ?
i' m glad we had this conversation so am i
i can' t wear a wire !
they' re feeling me up every day !
oh , come on .
you' il have complete protection
i' ve heard that one before i got to go put a dime in the meter
joe , put a dime in the meter for officer serpico
if you agree to testify in open court ...
no !
no what ?
no , i' m not gonna testify
i expect your gun and badge on my desk
promise me one thing , o' reilly .
you' re going to follow this all the way to the end of the line , where i got to be .
so help me , god !
what happened to the cannoli line ?
you' re supposed to say " forget about it , sanchez
i made a mistake , all right ?
it doesn' t make any difference , anyway
hey , i' m letting it go .
but don' t tell me it doesn' t matter .
every line matters .
get off my back !

we have a new student with us today .
his name' s max fischer and he' s actually asked to say a few words to the class .
max ?
you want to take it away ?
sure .
thanks very much
i just wanted to introduce myself
i' m max fischer .
i' m a former student of rushmore academy , which i recently got expelled from
this is my first time in a public school .
and i know you probably think i was born with a silverspoon in my mouth
but i' m no elitist .
i think you' ve got some great facilities and i' m really looking forward to making the best of it over here
i noticed you don' t have a fencing team .
i' m going to start one up .
let me know if you' d like to join
max ?
yes ?
hi .
i' m margaret yang .
i' m in mrs. whitney' s class .
i just wanted to tell you i liked your speech
i don' t think i' ve ever heard of anyone asking to give a speech in class before
how unfortunate !
the silver spoon remark might rub some people the wrong way but i think i know how you meant it
do you know it ?
i gotta go to class right here
janet , max fischer .
is he in ?
hey , max .
how' s it going ?
terrible
tell me something .
when you talk to miss cross the other day ...
excuse me .
do you have a telephone pass ?
one second
i got to tell you .
i don' t know what you see in her .
i don' t think she' s right for you .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
i mean , she' s not that beautiful .
she' s not that intriguing
she has something you can put your finger on .
but ...
look , mr. blume .
your comments are valuable .
but let' s get to the point
will she see me again ?
yes or no ?
no
i' m talking on the telephone
oh , come on .
that' s rude .
hey , fisher !
you better beat it , sunnie
you know , fischer .
i' ve been watching you .
showboat , always talking , picking a kid like dirk
because his mother' s a great piece and then getting nowhere
like everything you do .
big show .
no results .
what do you call getting a hand job from mrs. calloway in her jaguar ?
a fucking lie ?
you think i got kicked out for just the aquarium ?
nah .
it was the hand job .
you wanna know something else ?
it was worth it
i' m sorry i embarrassed you at dinner and please apologize to what' s his name for me
i will .
are you ok ?
i' m fine .
but i miss rushmore .
i miss the seasons .
and watching the leaves change
by the way , what time does the library close ?
i got an overdue book to turn in
that' s your handwriting , isn' t it ?
my husband gave me this book when he came to visit to me when i was 13
and he went to rushmore .
so when he died i gave it to the library here
you remind me of him , you know ?
i do ?
how ?
you remember you were in the rushmore beekeepers ?
yeah .

who sold you that crock ?
he told me himself
he says she gave him a hand job in the backseat of her bloody jaguar max never said that
yeah .
i suppose you' re right .
after all , the son of a brain doctor doesn' t need to impress anybody , does he ?
the killing has got to stop , esse it' s getting too loco .
no more gats nigger , you' re the crazy one
people will be trying to kill you .
are you talking about getting rid of your gun ?
it' s time , homey kiss me , little one
then he kisses her and we' re out .
ok is that for me ?
dear max , i' m sorry to say that i have secretly found out that mr. blume is having an affair with miss cross .
my first suspicions came when i saw them frenching in front of her house then i knew for sure when they went skinny dipping
in mr. blume' s swimming pool , giving each other hand jobs while you were taking a nap on the front porch
why am i telling you this now ?
because you' re such a good friend take care , pal .
fondly , dirk calloway
how was she , herman ?
jesus christ !
was she good ?
i bet she was .
although i wouldn' t know ' cause i never screwed her
going skinny dipping while i took a nap .
are you comfortable , max ?
" i' il just be out back nude getting hand jobs from the woman you love " we never went skipping dipping
sure , you didn' t .
and next you' re going to tell me you didn' t just walk out of her house at two o' clock in the morning
i' m in love with her
well , i was in love with her first
and all that crap about " i don' t think she' s that great " " i don' t think she' s right for you , max " that was all bullshit , wasn '
do you think she' s in love with you ?
i don' t know
