the name of this course is " american terrorism " .
200 years ago , we fought a revolution in the name of certain beliefs of liberty , of justice for all , of self rule and self reliance .
they are many in this country who feel we have not yet won that war .
terrorist acts , violent political theater , have been a part of social dissent in this country since its inception .
but why ?
why in this land of freedom ?
what' s led men to such bloodshed in the name of their beliefs ?
why in this era of prosperity has the anti government movement been at it' s peak ?
and what' s that going to mean when the prosperity fades ?
fewer of us are voting and more of us are joining the ranks of a resistence .
how long are we going to call these numbers insignificant ?
what do they have to teach us ?
wlfe and mother leah faraday 1961 1996 defender of country .
i' m going to explore .
only woman i ever liked having around that was smarter than me .
whit carver , generous to a fault .

i know what it would be .

this project is taking forever to get together .
the client can' t seem to make up his mind .
this the reston mall ?
yes , i' m getting it on track .
i' m sorry , i have to ...
are we going to see each other this weekend ?
yes !
the junior d' s .
the thing brady keeps talking about .
he' il love it and make more friends than he' il know what to do with .
they do campouts , they do trips .
they give you ...
they give you the house to yourself , every now and then .
you and brooke , i mean .
thank you , neighbor .
for what ?
for having a 10 year old next door .
what do you know about shopping malls ?
shopping malls .
i was at the langs talking with oliver .
he had this blueprint on his counter .
he said it was the reston mall .
that' s the one he' s working ...
but it wasn' t .
it wasn' t ?
i looked , brooke .
it was a building , not a mall .
right , it' s an addition .
no .
it was an office building .
it wasn' t stores at all .
so , it' s some other project .
why would he tell me it was a mall if it wasn' t ?
why would he lie ?
michael , when you took engineering in college , what grades did you get ?
i didn' t take engineering .
what i saw was an office building .
14 months ago , on a monday in junuary , over 60 federal employees went to work like they always did at the roosevelt federal building in downtown st. louis .
except on that monday , they didn' t come home .
ln a truck parked in front was hidden of c 4 plastic explosives .
when it was detonated it disintegrated the entire street side of the building , obliterating dozens of government offices , the building' s daycare center , and the st. louis branch of the lnternal revenue service , which was ultimately determined to be the target of the attack .
the truck was leased by this
dean scobee .
he had served prison time for tax evasion .
surveillance video showed he has inside the vehicle ,
leaving him among the 63 dead .
does anyone not remember this ?
we all know the results of the investigation .
the said scobee acted alone .
one man .
no conspirators .
right ?
he cheated the lrs , they caught him at it , so he blew them up .
this is a guy who people described as average ... friendly .
he' d been in the army but as a radio man .
he had a very little experience with munitions .
his parents considered him a moderate conservative .
and 2 weeks prior to this , he received a pay raise at his electrician' s job !
that sound like a man on the edge ?
or a man who needed a push ?
i don' t know .
i' m just asking .
professor , the feds did this huge investigation .
that' s right , an investigation , i forgot .
well , the investigation didn' t satisfy me .
miss o' neal , when you first heard the news terrorist attack in your own country , how did that make you feel ?
come on !
what did you feel ?
angry , scared , stressed .
did you feel safe ?
no .
then the next day , when they found scobee dead , did you feel some relief ?
some safety return ?
the people in that building , they felt safe , secure , just like you feel now .
then in an instant later , in an instant ,
they were gone forever .
we needed to have this man to blame .
we don' t want others .
we want one name and we want it fast , because it gives us our security back .
we can say ,
here was the one man , unlike the rest of us .
we named him and he is no more .
his reasons are gone too .
but the truth is , we don' t know why scobee did it .
why it came to this !
we can pretend we do , for 10 grand in taxes , but we don' t know .
and we' il never know .
still we feel safe
because we know his name .
as god is my witness ...
i promise to give ... friendship to those in need ... ... friendship to those in need ...
help to those in trouble .
i will work with faith and honor .
i will work with faith and honor .
to uphold the discoverer code .
to uphold the discoverer code .
to respect myself .
my family ...
and my country .
ladies and gentlemen , please welcome junior discovery troop 474 .
this is oliver' s study , where get away from the kids and me .
these are all projects you' ve worked on ?
i wish .
no ...
i collect sketches , blueprints , designs of old buildings .
the front of view of monticello .
there' s the woolworth building .
it' s his hobby .
the st. louis arch .
yes , correct .
then all these drawings are not just for your job ?
no .
so , they' re not all shopping mall .
no , i don' t know of any architecturally significant shopping malls .
you just haven' t built them yet !
who' s hungry ?
i' m famished .
come on , i got some really delicious puff pastry .
they' ve to work so hard when they' re there .
you have to keep them in their seats .
politically , there' s something to be said for that .
here we' re leaving the church .
everyone thought we were off to mexico .
where were you going ?
the plane never left the ground .
we had engine trouble .
we couldn' t wait , so we spent our wedding night at the witchita airport motel .
how romantic .
for $19 it was wonderful .
how long you two been married ?
12 years .
what kind of example is that for everybody else ?
i don' t think we learn responsibility from politicians .
we really learn it from family . is the people that we care about and who they care about .
my dad died when i was a teenager .
i' m sorry .
car accident .
my father mostly .
you get yours from ?
my values ?
probably from my wife .
values ?
what values ?
we were talking about where you get your values from , and we were both saying that' s mostly from family .
where else are you gonna get them ?
celebrities ?
politicians ?
not in this century .
it' s a sorry state of affairs , when you can' t find a role model .
it' s not even role models necessarily , it' s just people who acknowledge the consequences of their actions .
or pay for those actions .
we should put some of these politicians in jail .
oliver , you can' t ask government to be infallible .
but you can ask it to be accountable .
i can ask it to be honest .
when leah died , all i wanted was someone to tell me ,
we made a mistake
we made a mistake , your wife suffered for it ... and we' d take it back a hundred times if we could
but ... they don' t say that .
she would have .
some of them knew her .
they work so hard at being able to look at you in the eye .
excuse me .
leave him alone .
he' s fine .
sorry .
it' s okay .
i see how much you miss her .
these are just times when you ... realize how much of your own life is out of your hands .
what are you gonna do ?
i guess you can have faith .
try to make a difference where you can with grant ... ... with your classes .
what about you ?
i got my family .
and the buildings i leave behind .
that' s it .
get your shoulder up a little .
step into it .
watch that ball until it hits the bat .
that' s it !
you want some cracker jack ?
you sure ?
popcorn and caramel , it builds your muscles .
alright .
out of the way , faraday .
he' s getting confidence up there .
he' s a strong kid .
who' s been dealt some hard breaks .
that' s a way to swing .
you give him strength , michael .
i' m trying .
you do .
getting on with your life .
that' s important for him to see .
he just wishes someone had to pay .
what ?
for his mother .
he wishes someone had to pay .
he' s talked to you about her ?
her people send her in with the wrong information then say , " not my fault " .
i can' t live with that .
or you .
let alone a 9 year old boy .
he talked to you about his mother ?
yeah .
i hope that' s alright .
we talk about a lot things .
he' s a smart kid .
way to go , grant .
never more wise than when we' re children .
they say it and it' s true .
we' il never see things that clear again .
let me have a hit .
grant !
grant !
grant , it' s dinner time !
wash your hands !
i' m eating with brady !
no .
come now .
brady invited him over for dinner .
i thought he asked you .
can i eat with brady , dad ?
ollver lang , thlstlewood way st .
louls , mlssourl .

ls it all right , kids ?
good afternoon , u penn .
transcript office , please .
transcripts .
i' m calling from g. w. university .
we have a student who' s applied for work in our history department . and i need to verify his undergrad record with you .
he' s been out of school for some time .
the name is oliver lang .
are you telling me you took this out of his mail box ?
that is illegal .
tell me you don' t think this sound strange .
the u. penn , keeps sending alummni stuff for a20 year reunion .
he says he went to kansas state , they have him mixed up .
i called penn and got his transcripts .
what ?
why ?
michael !
listen to me .
that guy has a completely different physical description .
he never took a class in engineering .
probably because they' ve got him mixed up with somebody else .
brooke , this u penn " oliver " is the same age as oliver .
wait as our ?
as our oliver .
yes !
he graduated the same year and he comes from carson , kansas .
oliver' s home town .
i' m lost here .
you just said they are two different people .
two people of the same age from the same small town .
it' s a small town !
so what ?
wouldn' t they have heard of each other ?
oliver didn' t say anything like that .
he just threw the letter away .
wait a minute .
there could be 10 michael faradays in northern virginia ...
... and you' d never know it .
so , i called kansas state .
here' s what i' m saying .
kansas state university ... had no oliver lang on record from that or any year .
either he didn' t go to that school , or that' s not his real name .
can i ask you something ?
did you do this to me ?
call up my ex boyfriends , get my transcripts sent over ?
admit something' s not right here .
no , this isn' t right .
you invaded his privacy .
maybe he lied about his college .
people lie .
that doesn' t give you the right to spy on them .
you of all people !
are you teaching the bill of rights , or did that not make the program ?
i don' t know what you' re doing .
we' ve made some friends .
all right ?
i' il see you later .
kansas state unlverslty class of 78
where is he ?
fenimore !
' cause you' ve never been away from home !
you' re 9 years old !
9 and a half .
there' il be grown ups !
the answer is no !
you said i could go .
now i' m saying you can' t , go !
maybe you can go to summer camp , or something , okay ?
brady' s going !
brady might not be the best kid for you to be alone with .
dad ...
the answer is no !
he' s my best friend .
grant , you want to go to camp so bad , we' il go to ...
aunt ruth and uncle rob' s cabin .
it' s a lie !
no , it' s not .
you' re too busy .
you' il forget !
like now !
we' il go up ...
you' il forget you said i could go !
hey there .
he lied to me .
the fbl keeps a file on every american charged with a crime .
now , certain offenses cause files to be " flagged " .
2 years ago , these " flags " , picked up a series of suspicious firearms purchases in maryland ,
georgia and the carolinas .
over 100 guns , from assault rifles , army issues , all bought by acquaintances of seaver parsons , husband , father of 3 , amateur gun collector , an outspoken member ... of the rightwing here in virginia .
to the fbl , parsons was stockpiling weapons for some sort of offensive .
they sent 4 fbl agents with a search warrant here , thinking they would uncover some sort of ... treasure chest of felony firearms .
munitions for war .
7 november , we got you eye balled .
back up' s en route .
how do you want to handle it , boss ?
the easy way .
yeah , i heard that .
hey there , mister .
catch yourself some dinner ?
ls that your house there ?
know if your father' s home , son ?
he don' t know you .
no , son , we' re from washington .
there , at this fence , they encountered parsons ' youngest son , age 10 .
they asked him where his father was , but ... failed to first identify themselves as federal agents .
run up and ask your daddy to come outside , because some people would like to speak to him .
okay ?
cover the house !
no !
the back up will keep him .
no , cover the ...
the kid doesn' t know why we' re here .
they' re here !
help !
they' re coming !
back up !
he' s just a kid !
they' re here !
put the gun down !
cease fire !
pinned down , they returned fire .
finally , the reinforcements arrived .
when it was over , the seige lasted over two hours .
at the end ,
parsons ' two eldest sons were wounded .
his wife and his youngest boy were killed .
as for parsons ... he wasn' t even home .
see , the fbl ... thought ... they were uncovering some sort of terrorist plot .
but what their files , their " flags " did not reveal to them ... was that seaver parsons had come into a family inheritance ... with which he had arranged the 100 legal firearms to be legally purchased !
nor did it tell them that parsons had recently applied for a sales licence .
nor did it tell them that parsons had warned his family ... that some people might want to steal his collection .
and he instructed his sons and his wife , and his daughter in law never ... to let strangers on his property while he was away .
and if force be taken , then to defend with force .
defend the home !
he had no love for the federal government .
he did have a separatist and suspicious past .
but this was not a terrorist .
he was not a criminal .
and 3 innocent people died that day ... because the " flags " went up .
and the " flags " were wrong .
don' t dive in .
think for yourself .
i want you to be safe .
let go of my hand .
i want you to have a great time , okay ?
listen to your troopmaster .
did brooke tell you to let me go ?
yes , she did .
she said you' re a big guy and you can handle 10 days away .
when i get back , is she going to take mom' s place ?
nobody is going to take mom' s place , not brooke .
nobody .
mom is always going to be with us .
right here .
because we remember her like nothing could take her away .
lf brooke and i ever start thinking about something like that , we' il talk to you first .
she' il only live with us if mom says it' s okay too .
okay .
you have a great time .
thanks for camp , dad .
you have a good one .
thanks , dad .
see you !
see you later .
his name was william fenimore , and i' m told he changed it to oliver lang .
it may take me a few moments , sir .
we do have william fenimore of carson , kansas , changed to an oliver lang .
do you know when that was ?
october 5th , 1981 .
thank you .
that was exactly what i was looking for .
state of kansas .
records .
michael jones , i' m with the e. e. o. c. in washington .
i' ve got a possible name change i want to run by you guys .
i' m looking for an oliver lang , of carson , kansas .
hold on , sir .
sir ?
we got nothing on any name change ... for an oliver lang , carson , kansas .
just doing my job .
thank you .
sir ?
our record indicate ...
oliver lang deceased october 4th , 1981 .
october 4th ?
yes , sir .
the 4th ?
what does the death certificate say ?
cause of death listed as gunshot .
huntng accident .
you said you were calling with whom in washington ?
thank you .
run through the scenario with me .
why would someone do that ?
change their name to the name of the person who died the day before ?
someone the same age , from the same hometown .
why ?
would it be to take over that person' s life ?
no , that wouldn' t work .
when you die , the death cert goes both state and federal .
driver' s licence , social security .
they' re voided .
you couldn' t do it to hide the person you are .
then why would you do it ?
to hide the person you were .
say you wanted to find out a criminal record for your guy ... prior to the name change .
unless you' re a professional , ..
you' d check on the name he has now ...
and the record you' d find back then would be for somebody else .
that' s the significance of changing right after the person' s death .
no overlap .
it gives you a whole new history .
it helps the old one disappear .
something you want to tell me ?
whit , if i give you a name , could you run it for " flags " ?
jesus , michael !
just this once .
check out files as a personal favor ?
you don' t get fired for that .
you go to jail .
whit , this is important !
my pension is important !
i' m asking you to run a name .
i' m not asking you to start surveillance and break out guns .
faraday , if you' d asked your wife to do it , she' d tell you the same .
get you classified fbl information ?
i love you baby , but ...
i can' t do it .
lf you want to find out about somebody , there are ways to do it .
but just not through me .
use your imagination .
hi , daphne , how are you doing ?
you doing okay ?
hi , hannah .
mommy and daddy aren' t home .
actually , i don' t need your mom and dad .
you know what ?
i locked myself out of my house .
i came home and realized ...
we can' t let strangers in .
i' m not a stranger .
what i need is to use your phone ... to call up ... somebody to help me get in the house .
would that be all right ...
if i use your phone ?
kitchen .
good .
i' m going to use the phone in your dad' s study .
you' re playing here .
that' s dad' s study !
i' il just be a sec .

your dad won' t mind .
hello ?
yes , i got ... a home lockout .

yes , i have identification .

the locksmith guy is coming .
did you want to wait here ?
i' m just back from the store .
no , thanks .
i got a call from brady today .
he and grant are having a wonderful time .
he went on about the bugs they are catching .
i don' t know if there' s a badge for that .

no , i should get back to some papers ... that i can grade while i wait but thank you ... ... for the call .
sure .
thank you , girls .
our house is your house .
michael !
just a sec .

today' s not good .
i hear you .
i got a contract that' s kicking my butt .
get back to work .
i' m sorry to drop by .
catch you back at the ranch .
good to see you .
will you just hear me out ?
the guy changed his name .
why ?
to help hide his background .
why ?
because there' s something in it !
something that' s not your business .
when he was 16 , he tried to blow up some offices .
read the paper !
a government agency that was cheating his father' s farm !
he served time in a juvenile program !
pipe bomb .
as a kid !
why would you go to these lengths ... to hide that part of your history ?
lf it wasn' t an isolated event ?
lf you thought you might try again ?
it says it didn' t go off .
he was a kid !
brady practically killed himself with a bunch of fireworks !
what , in march ?
come on !
what does that come from ?
where does he get an idea like that ?
what are you saying ?
i' m saying ... he' s going to great lengths to hide his past .
he was in st. louis when the federal building was bombed .
and there' s a blueprint in his house that he does not want me to see .
are you listening to yourself ?
are you listening to me ?
are you listening to me ?
your neighbor ... is a terrorist ... who has been blowing up buildings ?
there' s something going on over there !
something' s being planned .
oh , something' s being planned ?
and in his spare time , he pays the mortgage , and takes his kid to camp an his daughters to ballet class .
that house is not normal !
that house is normal , michael !
remember when we were over there the other night ?
him discussing politices with us ?
and washington and leah ?
do you remember this ?
the guy is testing me .
you brought up leah .
he wants to see if i' m an enemy or an ally !
michael , you are the one who brought up leah .
ls that what this is about ?
no , it' s not about leah .
this class that you slave over ... to carry o leah' s work , to have something in her memory ?
these plots and conspiracies , red flags going up .
this is leah' s world !
i can' t ...
listen , i know .
but ... ... he' s changed his name .
michael , stop it , for me .
but he was in st. louis , and the bombs ...
for me ! ... going off !
he' s working on this building he doesn' t want me to see .
i can' t stay here tonight .
i' m not staying .
brooke !
i never did like that picture .
you know me , michael ?
you think you know me ?
you know me better than i know myself , don' t you ?
kansas city star ?
i saw you .
want to tell me something i don' t know ?
i know what i read .
you know a 16 year old kid .
you don' t know me .
you know a kid at 16 .
damn you !
you' ve been a guest in my house !
and you in mine , fenimore !
bill , will , william ?
what do i call you ?
who are you to judge me ?
what gives you the right ?
you ever worked on a farm ?
to make a living , support your family ?
government stole my father' s water .
the stream that ran through our land .
they said they were appropriating it for other uses .
we couldn' t grow crops or raise cattle .
we had loans we couldn' t pay .
my father woke up one morning and realized he was worth more dead than alive .
his skin and bones were worth ... more in insurance money ... than as a damn farmer .
i found his tractor ... at the bottom of the bluffs .
he made it look like an accident .
i found his body .
and the note , ... he wrote it to me .
the insurance money paid off what mom could ... but it wasn' t enough .
the neighbors ... the neighbors took our land at auction .
all because some bureaucrat stuck a pin in a map .
some creek in the middle of kansas .
we couldn' t use our own water .
doesn' t give you the right to a bomb .
16 !
you ever do anything wrong when you were 16 ?
you ever crash your car ?
did you ever steal anything ?
screw the wrong girl ?
you going to tell your kid everything you did at 16 ?
lies you told , drugs you took .
i' ve been judged for this .
i got sent away for it .
best thing that could' ve happened .
best thing .
who is oliver ?
he was my best friend growing up .
he died when we were both 25 .
i did it to honor him .
to carry on his name .
and to hide ... yeah , to hide .
because i didn' t want my son knowing what i did .
i didn' t want my kids to be burdened ... with people looking through old newspapers .
i' m not proud of this .
this isn' t pride .
i wish it never happened .
i wish to god ... that my family could have ... my father' s good name .
you have the right to know who lives next door .
who talks to your kid , who considers himself your friend .
but you also have the right ...
do you have a problem with me ?
do you have issues with me ?
you could have the decency to walk across the street ... and tell me to my face .
oliver !
hi , this is michael .
leave a message .
michael , it' s me .
listen , i think you' re right .
i saw oliver ... at the mall , in the garage , and he switched cars with somebody and i followed him ... to this warehouse delivery place , and they were unloading these long metal boxes .
i want to talk to you .
i' m coming over .
cheryl .
brooke .
i knew it was you .
hi .
hi .

a man was shot several times while driving on 19th street .
his out of control car struck other vehicles before slamming into a tree .
the victim was pronounced dead at the scene .
elsewhere , a single car accident near reston is tying up traffic on route 7 at this hour .
details are sketchy .
what we can tell you from our overhead shot ... is the accident took place near pine glen outlet center .
no other vehicles appear to be involved in this fatal crash .
we' il have more information when it becomes available .
the driver of the car , a woman in her mid twenties , was pronounced dead at the scene .
police say she lost control ... of her mustang and crashed through a guard rail along the ravine .
she was killed on impact .

we' ve got to keep this area clear .
she' s been taken away .

i' il call you back .
whit , listen to me .

the other day , when i was talking about somebody trying ... to hide their history ,
i was talking about my neighbor .
oliver lang !

william fenimore .
i want you to run it through your system .

offlce hours cancelled
was it hard to find me ?
you' ve moved several times .
your wife said , your ex wife ...
people know whose father i am .
i' ve been through all this before .
the government , the police ... and writers .
people wanted to believe it was political .
some conspiracy , some group .
abby and i did too .
dean was not a strong boy .
he was impressionable .
believed what friends said .
why couldn' t he be involved ... with people who could set him up , talk him into even this !
the fbl , the police , found nothing .
it was him alone .
they decided this .
63 dead .
over taxes .
dean alone .
you don' t believe that , do you ?
i would never believe that .
have you heard the name oliver lang or william fenimore ?
i' ve heard too many names .
your son , dean , was an electrician . maybe he was contracted for ... or he worked on a project ...
all of this was investigated !
his neighbors , customers ... kids he grew up with .
months ago !
dr. scobee , i' m sorry for bringing this all back .
it never goes away .
i had to come here , you' ve got to understand .
i think i know a man who knew your son .
he' s 41 , a structural engineer .
he' s got a wife , 3 kids .
he has this ...
what makes you so sure ... this man had anything to do with what happened here ?
for the same reason you' re sure ... your son didn' t do it alone .
i know my son was not alone because ten children died that day !
the daycare center in the roosevelt .
he had to know it was there .
my son wouldn' t have done anything to harm children .
not alone .
your son didn' t have any children .
but he did things for them .
he sponsored boys from city shelters .
discoverer troops .
he coached boys ' football when he had time .
wait .
discoverer troops ?
like boy scouts , but for younger children .
he was a grown up chaperone .
he' d take ' em camping .
he' d go to their meetings , teach them ...
here he is .
he must have been on some weekend adventure .
dean was best with children .

his troopmaster .
he and another boy .
what other boy ?

your son .
i saved his life !
that' s why you' re still here with us .
and brooke ?
brooke got in the way .
we' re on a schedule .
nothing personal .
what have you done with my son ?
lf you want to be his father , you' il walk to your house , sleep in your bed , teach classes and live your life .
how many people are you going to kill ?
lf i see any strange cars on my street , if you talk to anyone a federal agent , perhap ?
then we' re just gonna kill one .
he' s 9 years old .
when will he be 10 ?
he' s a good kid .
strong kid .
reminds me of a boy i grew up with .
maybe you' ve heard of him ?
oliver lang ?
they found him in the woods one day .
i' d hate for grant to see the same fate .
you sick fuck !
you' re a sick fuck !
i promise you , michael ... if you stay a good neighbor , and you are , ... you' il have him back .
but if you don' t calm down ,
i can' t guarantee his safety .
this' il be over in a few days .
when ?
you' re not in danger .

michael ... please ...
because of you , my son is alive .
i would like very much to return the favor .
now , we' re having a party .

everybody who ever used a bomb got a good look .
his name change was legal .
we run the social security number through the national crime center .
not mark in his record ever since .
him and everyone he knew came up clean .
that' s what you found out about ?
that wichita shit when he was 16 got you thinking .
do you have something new on this guy or not ?
or did you just not like him in your neighborhood ?
cause you got nothing .
lf this all you got , you need to stop teaching that class cause it' s getting inside your head .

check the van .
get them out of the building !
get them out of the building !
you have to get everybody out of the building !
it' s in there !
that' s not the man .
grant ?
let him go .
i said , let him go !
let him go .
the van is clean !
grant !
go ahead , michael , go ahead .
michael , it' s all clean .
the guy is authorized to be here .
we' re all authorized to be here , everyone except you !
alright ?
come on .
stop michael .
come back .
michael !
stand by .
... everyone except you .
right now , we' re breathless .
i just got here and there are people lying ...
at least a half dozen people here ... their faces are covered with blood , and there are crowds of people on the streets .
unbelievable !
it looks like a war zone !
half the building is blown away !
officials at this point believe , a bomb went off .
they' re not sure which floor , how big .
obviously it was massive to create this kind of devastation .
officials by proxy , have no idea at this point .
they just know it is an unbelievably serious situation .
only days , but now officially ...
preliminary reports indicate the bombing was the work of this man .
michael faraday , of reston , virginia .
a professor of history at george washington university ... who instructed courses on terrorism .
officials will not confirm reports ... had anything to do with the death of mister faraday' s wife ... who had been an fbl agent .
students and colleagues both say that faraday' s behavior ... was increasingly erratic in the weeks leading up ...
he was really intense , knew all about these terrorists , ...
how they worked , what they wanted .
it was my favorite class .
we went to this field trip once , it was at copper creek .
he practically broke down and started crying about his wife .
we all sort of knew about it but he never really wanted to talk about it .
faraday reportedly blamed the bureau' s role in his wife' s death almost 3 year ago .
specifically sources speculate his target may have been agent whit carver , ... one of the 184 people to perish in the attack .
carver was the partner of faraday' s wife at copper creek .
and faraday may have held him responsible .
all i know is what he told me one day after class .
i' il never forget that .
he said ,
sweetheart " one day those men are going to pay , ... one day , those men are going to burn
yet , all of them described faraday as a solitary , but friendly ... as a talent professor fascinated by the american underground .
and as a loving father to his 10 year old son , who is now in the care of relatives .
after exhausting hundreds of thousands of man hours , at least ... federal investigators are finally ready to say ... that just as in the st. louis lrs bombing nearly 12 years ago , ... this spring' s attacks on the fbl , the worst terrorist strike in our nation' s history ... was the work of one man and one man , alone .
any news yet ?
no .
they' il let us know .
someplace nice .
i hope .
someplace safe .
always .
