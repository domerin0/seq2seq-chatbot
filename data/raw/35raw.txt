we deal with this by sticking together .
we take it , we learn from it .
and we get back on a goddamn truck , and that' s how we honour dennis !
you got that ?
don' t you think it might fall apart ?
i hope not .
i was thinking about changing jobs .
what do you mean ?
it' s going search to rescue , pick a truck .
that means you' d be taking dennis ' place ?
i can' t think that way .
well would you ?
captain , this stuff is great .
that' s my grandfather .
and that' s sample of it .
these are my dad' s .
that' s him .
one of these he got after he passed away .
this one .
it' s medal of honour .

so what' s going on ?
something i wanted to talk to you about .
i was thinking about transferring to a truck .
jesus , why would you wanna do that for ?
you' re engine man .
truck' s a whole different thing .
pulling water between you and fire .
gorge you out and you' re lost in the smoke .
it' s not a good idea .
yeah , i know that .
i love being on the pipes , it' s just ...
