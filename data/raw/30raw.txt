i' il take 1 05 east to the 1 1 0 .
it' s faster .
what ?
the 1 05 to the 1 1 0 will get you there quicker .
the 1 1 0 turns into a parking lot around usc .
but once you get to la brea north of santa monica , it' s jammed .
the 1 1 0 north of the 1 0 , you get people driving to pasadena and they drive slow .

lf you had just listened to me , we' d be all bogged down in traffic right now , and you would' ve made an extra five bucks .
yeah , well , you keep that 5 bucks .
buy you something special .
go wild .
really , it' s not a big deal .
nothing big here .
how many cabbies do you know get you into an argument to save you money ?
there were two of us .
i had to kill the other one .
i don' t like competition .
take pride in being good at what you do ?
what , this ?
no , this is part time .
this is a fill in job .

you know , things like that .
how do you like being a lawyer ?

i love standing in that courtroom .
at the same time , i get this ... ... clenched up thing the night before the first days .
clenched up ?
how ?
i think i' m going to lose .
i think the case sucks , my exhibits aren' t in order ,
i' m not prepared enough , people will find out i don' t know what i' m doing and i' ve been running a charade all these years .
i represent the department of justice , and my opening statement will fall flat at the most important point and the jury will laugh at me .
and then i cry .
i don' t throw up .
a lot of people throw up .
i have a strong stomach .
and then i pull myself together , i rewrite my opening statement ... work my exhibits and that' s what i do for the rest of the night .
that' s my routine .
ln the morning it starts and i' m fine .

before you know it , he' s up on the bandstand , jamming with the band .
i mean , it had to be ...
oh , it was scary .
i mean , the dude was so focused , man .
plus , he was kind of a scary cat anyway .
everybody and their mama knew you don' t just come up and talk to miles davis .
i mean , he may have looked like he was chilling , but he was absorbed .
this one young , hip couple , one of them tried to shake his hand one day .
and the guy says , " hi , my name is ...
miles said , " get out of my face , you jive motherfucker .
take your silly bitch with you .
you know ?
that was miles , man .
that' s the way he was when he was in his musical headspace .

these three all came in within half an hour of each other , right ?
the kid and that last guy , both done by the same shooter , i think .

sylvester clarke , criminal attorney turned lawyer criminal . " i" ncluding ramone " , " who he represented " , " who s still missing .

i' m not the one lying to my mother .
she hears what she wants to hear .
i don' t disillusion her .
right .
maybe she hears what you tell her .
whatever i tell her' s never good enough .
it' s always been that way .
so , what' s at el rodeo ?
just drive .
they project onto you their flaws .
what they don' t like about themselves , their lives , whatever .
they rank on you instead .
how do you know ?
i had a father like that .
mothers are worse .
wouldn' t know .
my mother died before i remember her .

it is not bullshit .
1 2 years isn' t temporary .
got to get the cash together . lnsurance , bonds , maintenance , tires .
got to staff up , get the right client list .
it' s not just get the car and put asses in the seats .
