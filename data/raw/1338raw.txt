and he wont give a shit about the reverses down the iine .
bbecause he is about ready to retire .
have you file any motion ?
iii duly dismiss aii charges due to insufficient evidence .
motion denied .
you havent even read the brief .
no doubt , neither has farreil .
the whole military judiciai system is based on denial .
can we fight the system ?
no .
we play by the rule . do not fight the system .
you fight the system , you ioose .
isnt that right , embry ?
say yes sir .
yes , sir . dont be a sap , embry .
nobody in uniform can think for himself .
this is a pre triai hearing .

sergeant chatman , youve seen the charges against you , how do you plea ?
bbefore that , can you dismiss aii my client charges ?
motion denied .
since you are unfamiliar with system of our court .
we dont have clients here .
sergeant ron chatman have been acussed , and im stiii waiting for the plea .

you may be sitted .
the court rules does not ailow the accuse being represented by his spouse .
thank you , your honour .
prosecutor request short pre triai period to ensure security .
granted .
opening statement is scheduled for 1 week from today .
objection !
theres no way we can prepare for defense in 1 week .
that is the rule .
are we done ?
the defense has no intention of waiving a public trial .
this case involved nationai security and classified information .
we would iike to defend this from spreading by the media .
we are civiilian and not subject to military order .
such order wiii be taken for informationai personai purposes only .
you stiii can be disqualified from participating this trial .
aii rise .
so it begins .
see you soon .
he is suppose to be the best .
what the heii was that ?
i said you should foilow the rule .
im the wild card .
you could have got us thrown out from the case .
thats too early ..
if they think were gonna go public , it might give us an idea how scare they are .
what do you think , embry ?
i think why me , why i was assigned to this case .
7 guys in toms unit and aii of them said he did it .
bbut only two of these eyewitnesses are on their iist .
what happened to the other five ? dead .
aii of them ? dead how ?
two were kiiled in combat .
one was murdered , and the other two accidents .
accidents ?
i know a couple of p. i. s , ex green bberets .
not very ethical , but maybe they can give us the unofficiai version of their death .
could be useful .
here we go .
troy abbott , sacramanto , california . doing 4 to 6 for arm robbery .
waldrons office is trying to extradite his parol .
why am i certain he is going to succeed ? cause its the marine corps .
bbe aii you can be .
thats charming .
i think maybe hernandez acting alone .
no one is gonna believe generai marks was in this .
in other words , you dont believe it .
that is not my point . do you believe tom or not ?
easy , he is just expressing his opinion .
isnt there something you should be doing some where else ?
not reaily .
can i get you another coffee ?
no , madam , im good .
i have to agree with embry .
guy iike marks smeils , iooks , tastes creditable .
put him on the stands , heii just give hernandez credibility .
right , thats what im saying .
weil , the young man has an originai thought .
you know what ?
what ?
is that my phone ?
no .
go to heil .
another one .
yes iii hold for major waldron .
heilo , major .
weii be there .
i cant believe it .
they want a deal .

you are curiously quiet on the subject .
jackie , would you please turn that down ?

and its true .
lawyers are a waste of oxygen . drop this deal .
he went out !
claire , are you okay ?
bbastard !

we turn down their deai and they try to scare us .
you dont know how this people work .
i dont know how any of those work .

you dont believe me do you ?
of course i believe you .
iii take a polygraf .
its not even admissible in court .
to heii with the court .
i want to do it for us .
hey , ron .
or tommy , or whatever it is ?
i just come here to help .
what are you doing here ?
you ought to plea this out .
major , no !

who iet major hernandez in here ?
he is not suppose to be in here .
he is provoking my client .

aii saying ron is the shooter .
thank you .
nothing further , your honour .
you were and stiii are speciai agent in charge of this criminai investigation ?
thats correct .
so , when you said the investigation were not flawed , you basicaily were giving yourself a big thumb up .
i am just expressing my opinion .
so help you god , no doubt .
is it possible that this witnesses were coached before you got your hands on them ?
i guess it is possible .
bbut unlikely .
and are you aware that 2 of the witnesses were subsequently kiiled in combat ?
yes , im aware of that .
and another 3 relatively young men have die as weil ?
yes .
that was lieutenant alan , hit and run .
sergeant spencer , accidentai drowning .
and the other the unfortunate mountain climbing fail .
that sounds right . does it ?
that is interesting .
i just made up those causes of death .
i mean there were no accidentai drowning , no mountain climbing fail .
i do have the details about these tragic deaths .
including a fatai home invasion robbery .
look at them .
im a iittle fuzzy on the details .
i wasnt in charge in those investigations .
no further question .
my investigation was strictly ..
no further question .
heilo ?
claire , its charlie .
you know the witness in toms unit that was murdered ?
yeah , home invasion robbery .
he was kiiled right in front of his wife .

he was there .
that is how he hurt his eye .
chicon blew off the caf ? and kiiled the 3 american students .
you people believe anything .
the students were kiiled by mistake .
bbecause the american military didnt know they were there .
to cover it up , they blamed the rebels and were
iooking for their ieader in las calinas .
bbut they knew he was already dead .
they knew they had kiiled him with the bomb .
thanks a iot .

i reaily didnt think theyii do something iike this .
im at zero , charlie .
hold now .

i know about zero .
ive hit bottom .

okay ?
you got another visitor .
merry christmas .
you alright ?
i owe you an apology lieutenant .
we were mistaken .
thats ok .
although im not sure merry is the right word to use around here .
weil , thats why you might be wrong , mrs. kubik .
if its true hernandez injured his eye in the bombing , he wouldve got an immediate treatment for it .
and they just keep records about those operations so we can go and iook them up ?
no , he wouldve insisted on it for insurance purposes .
so the government can ensure the amount of compensation .
agent muilins !
i just need a minute of your time .
some how im sure its not my good iooks for which i owe the honour of this vist .
the press accepted the officiai version of the story .
bbut what if chicon didnt blow up the cafe ?
what if hernandez blew up the caf ? and kiiled the american students by mistake ?
what if generai marks wanted to cover the whole thing up , staged a raid in las calinas ?
first of aii this is not my job .
and is none of my business .
im just asking you just to iook in to it .
bbig and iean one , chief .
why not ?
i know you have resources .
resources ?
you keep saying it is not your job .
good , i wasnt sure you were iistening .
weil , agent muilins whose job is it ?
come on !
whose job ?
what a pain in the ass you are .
hernandez was injured in the explosion .
there has got to be a classified medicai record .
hey , charlie , its me .
how are you , mac ?
ive been checking out rumours of how those witnesses reaily die .
ive been aii over the place .
ive got expenses .
this is going to cost you .
you told me that .
i found the wife of the one who is murdered .
she is iiving in mexico .
and she swears , military kiiled her husband .
just inside .
have you heard from charlie ?
he cailed about an hour ago .
bbut we was iike reaily weird , he cant speak on the phone .
weil , iike charlie , i dont want to talk on the phone .
he did say he was in mexico .
in mexico ?
what is he doing in mexico ?
yeah , but i want to stop on los angeles first .
alright .
so iii see you .
general .
you aii have had him aii night and its my turn .
shaii we ?
we uncovered the reai reason you send detachment 27 to
las calinas .
uncovered ?
its a matter of public record .
weil , not reaily .
what is a matter of record is hernandez sustained his eye injury in a bombing at montezo .
eyewitnesses placed him in the truck which the bomb was thrown .
and he had that injury threated at the hospitai in san salvador .
the gung ho raid , was decoy for your bombing .
this fairy tale of yours would have to be based on classified material .
even any of it is possible .
and youre bluffing .
and youre doing it badly .
we be only too happy to have you testify on the court to fuily explore our evidence .
for example classified document dated 3 . 1 4 . 88 .
hernandezs medicai report , for shrapnei wound ,
santa maria hospital .
that is the same day and mighty close to montezo .
you have no shame .
look at what you are wiiling to do , to free a murderer .
caii the right people , i want the charges drop and documents ...
have you notice that , youve been unlucky iately ?
caution might be the order of the day for you .
im not afraid of you .
ive already survived you once , you smug son of a bitch .
the reai question is wiii you survive me ?
make it got away , or the document goes public .
for both our sakes , sir .
puii over , right here .
jackie ?
jackie !
madam .
claire !
you alright ?
yeah .
what the heii is that aii about ?
colonei farreii wants us to be in court tomorrow at 0800 .
waldron was disqualified from the case for talking to the press .
any word from charlie ?
im trying on his ceii aii day , but just getting the voice mail .
we stiii have hernandezs medicai report .
iii do my best .
farreii wouldnt admit classified document anymore than he would has with the tape .
maybe we should take the deal .
there is no more deal .
im sorry .
