alrighty .
how you feeling , tiger ?
good .
now let' s hear you .

yeah .

in order to zero the full eight weeks i had to heat your brain to 42 . 5 c.
i' m fine .
i' m saying it' s getting harder , mike .
i said , i' m fine .
you' re slowing down .
come on .
i' d be faster if you' d shut up .

see how you did that ?
how you focused ?
yeah .
i focused on your face .
you know you love me .
come on .
don' t be mean to the one who does everything for you .
do you realize you' ve never once asked me what i see when i erase your memory ?
basically , the last two months just never happened for you .
what' s to know ?
20 hours a day in a clean room ripping off a guy' s idea for a computer , selling it to somebody else .
what' d you do the last two months ?
the last thing i remember is driving in spain in the aston martin ,
learning to dive in belize with what' s her name .
the seven stadiums in seven days trip .
it' s great .
i mean , my memories are basically highlights .
it' s good .
it' s a good life .
the stuff you erase , it doesn' t matter .
what is it with guys like rethrick ?
he' s gotta have everything , huh ?
say what you want about jimmy , he started allcom in his garage .
wait , wait .
don' t you leave me alone .
what ?
you' il be fine .
talk .

i don' t want to mingle .
hello .
i' m michael .
i' m rachel .
rachel porter .
is that miss or mrs. ?
that would be dr. porter .
doctor .
well , excuse me , doctor .
it' s all right .
what kind of a doctor are you ?
i' m a biologist .
really ?
do you work for jimmy ?
it must be very top secret biology that you practice .
oh , yes .
isn' t everything ?
let' s go .
excuse me ?
i mean , i' m happy to continue blathering on , trying helplessly to charm you , but i thought maybe , you know , cut to the chase and just , you know , go somewhere .
i' il tell you what , michael .
i' m gonna walk over there and talk to a friend of mine .
if you get the urge to have a real conversation , you' il know where to find me .
ok .
fair enough .
it was nice to meet you .
giving up so easily ?
you don' t believe in second chances , now , do you ?
in my experience , no , i don' t .
good night .

how you doing ?

good to see you .
you too .

<i>alarm disabled . </ i>
i don' t think you' d look good covered in foam .
even in that suit .
what' s the pitch , jimmy ?
i know you' re trying to sell me something .
what is it ?
when there was a time we were in school , we wanted to change the world .
i thought we wanted to save the world .
well , that' s semantics .
what' s the job , jimmy ?
can' t tell you .
other than to say that it involves optics .
and you get stock options for this one .
get a real piece of the company .
what if it doesn' t work ?
i get a real piece of nothing .
i promise you , it won' t fail .
how do you know that ?
is this a real crystal ball ?
i wish .
the point is , i' il guarantee that you do eight figures .
minimum .
what' s the catch ?
the job may require a little bit more time than you' re used to .
how much more time ?
two years .
maybe three .
you' re kidding .
deadly serious .
jimmy , that' s impossible .
you can' t do it .
the longest ever is eight weeks .
it was me .
assuming it were possible , would you do it ?
give up three years of my life ?
not give up , trade .
three years in return for the rest of your life .

you can still back out .
no hard feelings .
no , i want to stay .
michael jennings , meet the other half of your team , dr. william dekker .
nice to meet you .
it' s a pleasure .
gentlemen .
let' s have a look at the next three years of your lives .
what happened ?
michael .
you' re done .
<i> how long was it , jimmy ? </ i>
<i> it' s been three years , mike . </ i>
<i> how' d i do ? </ i>
<i> you did good . </ i>
<i>your money' s been transferred</ i> <i>to your account at reddy grant . </ i>
<i>you' ve got an appointment</ i> <i>there at 1 : 00 . </ i>
<i>just go home , do the paperwork . </ i>
<i>when you feel up to it , give me a call . </ i>
<i>we' ve got a lot of catching up to do . </ i>
ninety two million dollars .
everyone at reddy grant appreciates your business .
well , not as much as i appreciate my business , i promise you .
ok .
just sign there .
all right .
great .
your personal items .
yes .
you only needed four stamps .
oh , well , guess i could afford the extra 50 cents .
i don' t think this is my stuff .
it' s not ?
no .
i don' t know what happened .
it' s all right .
don' t worry about it .
it doesn' t matter .
let' s talk about my shares .
what i' d like to do is get some money now , and , you know , put the rest away for long term , to live off .
so how do we do that ?
mr. jennings , you forfeited your shares .
i beg your pardon ?
what ?
yeah , here .
dated four weeks ago .
you surrendered the shares and stated to deliver only the envelope of personals .
don' t you remember doing that , sir ?
no .
i don' t remember that , because i didn' t do that .
why would i do that ?
i wouldn' t do that .
it doesn' t make sense .
a mistake has been made , and it needs to be corrected .
i agree .
it' s a strange thing you did ...
it' s not strange .
strange is a little out of the ordinary , but still plausible .
giving away $100 million in shares in a fortune 500 company for some knickknacks isn' t strange , it' s insane .
no one would do that .
doesn' t make sense .
unless you think this is a $40 million can of hair spray , which is pink .
what , this is a $100 million book of matches ?
i' ve been out of it a few years .
is this back in style now ?
are these $100 million sunglasses ?
i' il look into it , but it' s gonna take me some time .
this is crazy .
i' m gonna make some phone calls .
<i>mr .
rethrick' s office . </ i>
it' s michael jennings .
it' s important .
<i> i' m sorry , he stepped away . </ i>
<i>he won' t be back until</ i> <i>this afternoon . </ i>
<i>i can try him on his cell phone . </ i>
just have him call me as soon as he gets in .
ok ?
<i> ok . </ i>
thank you .
listen , guys , a mistake has been made here .
all right ?
i' m not a traitor .
i' m an engineer .
a reverse engineer , right ?
we know that you accepted payment of classified government technology .
mike , that' s called treason .
in this country , people get fried for that one .
in this country when the fbi harasses you , you also get an attorney .
not today you don' t .
what the hell is this ?
the attorney general calls me and says that michael jennings ' cooperation is a matter of national security .
look , first of all , that stuff isn' t mine , ok ?
a mistake ...
what is ... ?
perfect fit .
you were saying ?
well , let me show you a few pieces of the puzzle that we' re solving .
william dekker , government physicist , weapons division .
three years ago , his project gets shelved .
he didn' t like that , so he sold his work .
classified work .
showed it to several corporations .
we think rethrick bought it .
unfortunately , we can' t link rethrick to the sale , because dekker died .
natural causes .
natural " being gravity after a 140 foot fall out of his apartment building .
what does this have to do with me ?
patent applications filed this month .
they show designs based on dekker' s work .
look whose signature is on every one of those documents .
get it ?
it' s your name on those patents !
rethrick can claim he knows nothing about dekker or the design .
you need to tell us everything you did for rethrick .
i can' t .
you' d rather spend your life in prison protecting your friend ?
help us , and we can work with you .
i can' t .
i can' t !
he wiped my memory !
i don' t remember !
i' il tell you whatever i know .
i was set up .
believe me .
i don' t remember what i did for the past three years !
what ?
wait a second !
wait !
we figured rethrick tried a wipe , so we' il try an extraction .
you' re not gonna see anything .
you' re wasting your time .
we' re getting something here .
come on !
come on !
shit .
we got nothing .
hold on a second .
i need a smoke .
hold on a second .
i need a smoke .
boss .
he won' t mind .
smoke !
shit !
goddamn it !
i can' t see anything !
secure the door !
where the hell is he ?
he' s loose !
don' t worry , he can' t go anywhere !
cover the door !
i' il get the lights !
i can' t see !

be careful .
hey !
hey !

hey !
hey !

relax .
everything' s fine .
you talked to federal agents .
it' s ok .
it' s been worked out now .
i just need to find out who sent these items .
will you help me out ?
they were sent three years ago .
no .
there was a mix up .
somebody else sent these .
i need to find out who that is and talk to them .
replacements were sent a few weeks ago .
who sent it ?
well , you did .
that' s you right here .
see ?
twenty items .
<i>i' m gonna need all</ i> <i>your personal belongings . </ i>
<i>michael jennings died</ i> <i>at three minutes after 3 . </ i>
the government , left with no case , closed its investigation of allcom .
so you see , it' s impossible that he escaped unless you changed something .
i didn' t .
what were you doing , exactly ?
i was eating pie .
he left the attorney' s office exactly when it predicted .
the feds took him exactly when it predicted ...
but he didn' t die like it predicted !
michael jennings is not a super agent .
he' s an engineer .
yet somehow he managed to escape from a double iocked room .
how ?
was it fate ?
no , fate was on our side .
that means someone changed something .
and it wasn' t me .
and if it wasn' t you , then who the ... ?
has anyone checked the machine since michael walked out of here ?
find him .
if you only look where you can' t go ,
you will miss the riches below .
yeah , i' m already missing my riches .

what does that mean ?
you' re saying the bank doesn' t exist ?
that' s comforting .

<i>michael . </ i>
say one word about this hat and i' m out of here .
oh , man !
oh , my god .
i told you not to take that job , mike .
come on , let' s get a table .
ok .
injections ?
yeah .
you would have to do it that way , i guess .
but , of course , that' s a chemical process .
so ?
well , you' d have some latent memories .
maybe that' s what i' m seeing .
most likely .
memories that made it through the wash , stirred up when the feds went in your head .
why would i have these things ?
explain this .
i sent myself this junk instead of the money .
oh , brother .
i don' t know .
that' s not the question you should be asking .
no ?
no .
you should be asking yourself , why did you give up all that money ?
that' s the most bizarre part of this whole thing .
ninety million dollars .
nobody changes that much in three years .
ok , all right , buddy .
i wanna figure out what you built .
all right , let' s work backwards .
they told me i was working on a design by someone named dekker .
dekker ?
yeah .
william dekker ?
i think so .
what i heard was , he was working on something level five for the feds .
they came in , shut him down .
what was it ?
well , the consensus was a laser .
why ?
because dekker' s drawings called for a mirror and a lens .
the only thing that uses those is a laser or a satellite camera to see things from far away .
<i>here comes the first number , 17 . </ i>
<i>followed by 44 . </ i>
the lens required perfect optics .
<i> four</ i> .
the mirror ...
<i> twenty six . </ i>
so the capital outlay is huge .
<i> thirty seven</ i> .
word was it was gonna cost <i> forty</ i> .
500 billion dollars .
<i> and</ i> <i>the bonus number is 22</ i> .
who' s gonna spend 500 billion dollars just to see something ?
what ?
no way i get out of that extraction room without the cigarettes and the glasses .
i would' ve never gotten on the bus without the ticket .
if i didn' t have the ring , i wouldn' t have followed that kid to reddy grant .
right .
i gave up that money just to make sure that i would pay attention to these items .
why ?
because i know what you' d spend 500 billion dollars to see .
the future .
<i>if you selected five numbers</ i> <i>and the bonus number, </ i> <i>you' re a second prize winner . </ i>
he used a virus .
the machine went down at 3 : 03 this afternoon .
3 : 03 .
can you program around the virus ?
no .
it' s not that kind of virus .
come on , i' il show you .
it' s not in the software .
it' s in the hardware .
he put a circuit somewhere in here .
it' s like a poison pill .
but you can find it , right ?
yeah , i can .
then do it .
slight change of plans .
according to mr. stevens , we don' t need jennings .
look , if we know anything , we know that time travel' s not possible .
einstein proved that , right ?
time travel , yes .
but einstein was very clear that he believed time viewing
theoretically could be accomplished ...
mike , mike .
come on .
maybe we should just find dekker ...
i can' t talk to dekker .
why not ?
he had an accident .
an accident ?
yeah , he ...
he fell out of his bedroom window .
fell out of ... ?
he fell out of his bedroom window !
i see .
sure .
that could happen .
jesus .
wait a minute !
we' ve gotta get out of here !
shorty , listen to me .
i think what happened was i used this thing , i saw my future .
and i saw what i needed to change it .
but all i could get out of allcom were these innocuous items .
each item has to be used at a specific time and place to accomplish whatever i needed to get done .
i mean , without the stuff in here , i' d already be dead .
yeah , well , it' s too bad that you don' t know what the rest of them are for .
what ?
gotcha !
hey !
great seeing you again , mike !
jesus !
those guys do not look like feds .
here .
listen to me .
take this .
this will get you through that door .
close it behind you .
understand ?
go !
ok !
go !
go on !
shit !
go !
oh , god , i hope that was a good thing to do .
shit .
go .
where' s your gun ?
he' s got it .
so ... ... how are you , mike ?
you ?
why ?
don' t remember ?
you brought this on yourself , mike .
so how does it feel knowing you' re going to die ?
shit .
he designed his own escape ?
mr. attorney general , sir , we have no explanation .
after looking at the evidence the only logical , albeit hard to accept conclusion , is he was able to predict what was going to happen to him .
these are memories extracted from jennings before he fled .
they don' t seem to add up to anything .
gladys .
that' s all for today .
we knew dekker was trying to design something , but when he sold his plans , he wasn' t even halfway done .
i don' t understand .
dekker was working at jpl on a laser enhanced lens .
he claimed the lens was powerful enough to see around the curvature of the universe .
he believed if you could see around a curve that went on forever you would end up back where you started ,
looking at yourself .
except you' re not looking at yourself now , in the present .
no , you are not .
you' re looking at the future .
imagine what will happen if jennings figures it out and tries to profit from it .
any nation will give a king' s ransom .
he won' t do that .
i was this close .
he never lied .
when he was accused he was hurt and scared .
bring him in , i' il give him the medal of honor .
that' s if rethrick doesn' t find him first .
you think he really saw the future ?
that would be something .
caf michel ?
my name is michael jennings .
and i can' t remember if i made a reservation there recently .
would you check that out for me ?
thanks .
i did ?
ok .
right .
how many is it for ?
oh , no , thank you .
no , i' il be there .
thank you .
hello , you two .
did he feed you ?
rachel , it' s jimmy .
you all right ?
why ?
you don' t know ?
no .
may i come in ?
when was the last time you saw michael ?
yesterday morning .
he was pulling an all nighter at his lab .
rachel , i' m sorry to have to be the one to tell you this .
michael left allcom yesterday .
permanently .
what ?
he finished his work .
we erased his memory , and he ...
no .
he left .
no .
he promised me .
he said he wasn' t going to go through with it .
he made a lot of money on this one , rachel .
he said he didn' t care about the money .
so she doesn' t know anything .
he wouldn' t leave without her .
it' s michael .
he' d be smart .
we' re missing something .
soon as she leaves for work , get in there .
make sure she can' t go anywhere alone .
<i>i want to know</ i> <i>what just happened . </ i>
