ms. james ?

miami , chicago and new york .
we are convinced that momento will be a tremendous domestic success ... which we can platform into international markets .
this perfume embodies the many attributes of a woman ... strength andintelligence ,,,
uh , sassiness and sexuality ...
also class ... and beauty .
enough !
enough !
i love you !
i love you all !
i love you !
i do !
what ?
what ?
well , your blood pressure is very high , tomas .
what seems to be the problem now ?
pain in my left eye .
i' m light headed , dizzy .
it' s like there' s no blood reaching my brain .
ah , well , sounds like stress .
uh , work problems ?
uh , i' m dating three women .
well , guess we know where all the blood is then .
i didn' t plan this !
all three are so different ... so beautiful , so ... so special .
you' d better choose one , or you' re gonna wearyourself out .
how can you choose between the colors of nature' s beautiful flowers ?
how ?
besides , they' d be heartbroken , and i' d be dead .
well , you may die from exhaustion .
so , um , what are their names ?
cici , patricia y lorena .
i' m married to a woman named bertha .
bertha ?
hmm .
choose one .
now , what name are you hoping for ?
i don' t know .
who is it ?
what matters is who are you hoping it is ?
quick !
uh , i don' t know .
who is it ?
that' s your conscious self talking .
your subconscious knows what you really want .
quick !
can' tyou just read it ?
please ?
that' s not the point .
your blood pressure is way too high .
we' il try some tranquilizers until you can work everything out .
until then , no driving , no alcohol and , most important ...
no women .
what ?
i' m gonna write one for myself .
now take out the third and seventh paragraphs .
yes .
give me one second .
okay .
now read it back to me .
the rest sounds fine .
have them sign and circulate it .
amor ?
thank you .
you' re welcome .
sit .
good girl .
agent quinn ?
yeah , it' s carmen , yeah , she just pulled up to someone' s house .
uh , no .
i don' t think it' s one of theirs .
you stay .
good dog !
surprise , papi !
what' s going on ?
what' s happening ?
what are you doing in my lingerie ?
your lingerie ?
open your fake eyes , honey !
he obviously gave this little number to all of us .
but only one of us is doing it justice !
but he' s mine !
he' s mine !
then , why is he in miami on monday giving me this ?
well , tuesday he was in chicago .
wednesday , new york .
este walter told me that a venus hootchie was moving in on my man !
what doyou mean your man ?
not that i would ever watch ... what' s his name ?
walter ?
i assure you that hootchie venus he was referring to is not me .
it' s you !
and you !
this is ludicrous .
tomas would not cheat on me ... with some bookworm and a maid .
i' m the maid , and i' m gonna wipe the floor with you !
this whole thing' s so absurd !
especially , since tomas and i are engaged .
tomas fuentes bought you that ring ?
yeah .
nice !
cubic zirconium .
for 10 bucks i can get you a matching pair of earrings .
wait a minute , that' s a ... that' s a pinky ring !
you better get back to the castle , princess , before you turn into a pumpkin !
well , at least it' s real , which is more than i can say for some ... other things in this room .
that' s it !
i' il shove your tiara right upyour ...
hold it !
hold it !
psycho .
this is just perfect !
tomas fuentes cheats on us , and we fight with each other ?
this man , as we have witnessed ,,, he is deceiving , he is conniving ... and he is untrustworthy !
have we no pride , girls ?
he doesn' t deserve us !
i' m with the bookworm .
my mom always said ...
lfa man cheats on you , he doesn' t respect you .
i propose that we walk out ofhere , and we never look back .
we should wait here and give him a heart attack .
no , no , no , no .
we must cease and desist of all contact whatsoever .
that' s what he deserves .
cracked huevos is what he deserves .
but i like your plan ... it' s subtle .
and subtle' s your middle name .
as of this moment , we agree to be honest in our intention ... to abandon tomas fuentes .
we swear on our oath as honorable women .
who taught you to talk like that ?
agreed ?
agreed .
good .
i' m lorena morales .
i' m cici .
just " cici " ?
like charo .
like cher .
que ridiculez , i am patricia sofia ... whatever !
ordonez coronado del pescador .
ay , she must be european !
remember , we' ve got to be strong .
because we deserve more than this .
i don' t care how many times he tries .
i will not take his call , neither will i.
i wonderwho he will call first .
i mean ...
i know it won' t be me .
if he can have you two , what would he want with a chica like me ?
pues , ciao , muijeres ,
well , i guess , this is good bye .
yes , good bye .
if he can have you two , what would he want with a chica like me ?
tomas needs intellectual stimulation .
and culture .
he wouldn' t go for the ...
blond with the boobs ...
would he ?
would he ?
romeo meo romeo meo rome romeo rome romeo
okay , tomas .
it' s time to relax .
mi amor , i was just thinking about you .

of course , my sweet .
where are my manners ?
oh , i don' t know .

oh , my god !
no way .
no way .
now , stay calm .
breathe , tomas .
just breathe .
patricia , i was just thinking about you .
how could you , tomas ?
i thought you had better taste than a librarian and some sort of ... a prostitute !
what areyou talking about ?
who are those drinks for ?
for me ?
two drinks ?
yes .
so i don' t have to come back for a refill .
see ?
mmm .

ay , cici !
you' ve been very , very bad , cabron !
mamita .
take a good look at me , papi .
feast your eyes on what you' re losing and forwhat ?
it' s not what you think .
some stuck up , pinche ,,, ice princess and a mousey little office clerk !
i hope it was worth it !
i can explain .
listen .
because you' re don' t get these chichis tonight !
well , i' m back at this house , but something funny is going on .
aha !
you came back !
i knew i couldn' t trust a tramp like you !
you liar !
liar ?
me ?
your fake eyed , funny named , culo crawled back before i did !
what have you done to him !
the librarian ?
i am a lawyer !
oh , you tricked us !
i didn' t .
" and we deserve more than this , " my ass !
i did it ...
so you could have tomas for yourself .
big word talker !
i didn' t plan to come back !
it was just ... damn it , it was cici' s chichis !
tramp !
pendeijas !
underachievers .
sounds like it' s getting violent .
wait .
what are we doing ?
what are we doing ?
trying not to kill somebody .
please don' t kill me .
i didn' t mean to .
shh .
quinn quinn ... i can' t hear anything .
leave your man wanting more .
we' re gonna need more than that , papi .
i won' t shareyou .
make a choice , tomas , choose or you die .
i choose ...
i ...

tomas !
what are you doing ?
i have to make sure he' s okay !

i' m a cocktail waitress .
i was thinking about getting a job too .
anyway , i really want to be a dancer ,
ihe kind with the pole ?
no !
a real dancer .
everything i know , i taught myself .
and that' s hard to put on a resume .
i know what people think when they look at me ,
i may not look smart , but i' m full of surprises .
but what about you , miss puerto rico ?
how come you' re a lawyer and you have no dinero ?
because i work for the people .
what people ?
our people ,
i fight the fight for rights for all latinos ,
i fight against discrimination .
i fight against inequality .
i fight for the people who have no voice !
que bueno , you should save that for the beauty contest tomorrow .
you know that i' ve ...
i' ve never been in a beauty contest before .
and you' re not in one now .
being a fake beauty contestant is better than a fake maid .
tomorrow , can i be miss puerto rico and lorena be the maid ?
and now , the moment we' ve all been waiting for .
and the winner is ...
miss lorena !
yea , lorena !
way to go , lorena !

you' re hot , baby !
lorena morales , do you swear to be my only , my one and only ... and nothing but my one and only so help you god ?
i do !
lorena , yeah !
you' re my love , and i won' t share you with anyone .
this is ridiculous .
i should be going to the ball , not those tacky , ugly hags .
help me with my dress !
the buckle on my shoe is loose !
fix it !
would you hurry ?
i don' t want to miss the prince .
may i have some water ?
i am so thirsty from my travels .
you got it , prince .
certainly .
you' re so very beautiful .
i am , aren' t i ?
and i' m wasting away in this horrible dungeon .
would you like to ride away with me ?
more than anything .
let' s go .
my papi .
yes , tomas ?
how dare you ?
how dare me ?
how dare you !
keep your hands off the merchandise !
oh , you wish .
hello ?
yes .

where ?
we have to take the car to fala' s boyfriend' s friend .
it' s a long story .
i have to meet the judges .
no , you don' t .
and why should we go with you ?
because we' re in this together , because we have a common bond ... and because i don' t trust either one of you ... alone with tomas .
okay .
fine .
then , i' il just go downstairs ... and spill the frijoles on little miss puerto rico .
i' m sure motel 6 will have a room .
we' re in .
well , what about tomas ?
what if he wakes up ?
still out like a light .
we' il leave fifi here to guard him .
come on , fifi .
let me help you get your favorite toy .
good girl !
this is so bizarre .
i could' ve sworn i put it in here .
i have a better idea .
hotel security .
baby , i' m chasing papi , chasing papi .
baby , i' m chasing papi , chasing papi .
now we have to wait for some guy named rodrigo .
we have to wait ?
in this heat ?
is the sun too bright for your pretty , fake blue eyes ?
what' s that supposed to mean ?
only that someone in this car is ashamed of being latina .
i' m not ashamed of being latina .
i can' t believe i' m missing the pageant for this .
you' re not in the pageant !
all right , all right .
there' s the car .
let' s go .
okay .
okay , just a minute .
what ?
just a minute .
i gotta take these pills before the novocaine wears off .
you can' t stand a little toothache ?
shoot !
it ... it' s a root canal .
it' s the most painful thing you could have .
haven' t you ever heard of people saying ...
rather have a root canal , " when they don' t want to do something ?
no , but you would rather have two root canals than to blow this deal .
look here , victor .
tonight is the night .
we make this pickup , and then we are in with the big boys .
are you almost finished ?
let' s ... let' s go .
okay .
okay .
i' m miserable , you know ?
you could be a little more sensitive .
ladies , you are late .
rodrigo .
the last thing i picture you doing on the internet is buying a car .
here .
great car .
really roomy .
the radio sticks a little bit .
where' s the bag ?
what ?
where is the bag ?
the bag ?
where is the bag ?
the bag with the money .
oh , my god .
was it supposed to be in the trunk ?
look , don' t play with me , little girl .
i object to you calling her a little girl .
and who the hell are you ?
i am a woman with a conscience .
you' re about to be a woman without a pulse , if we don' t get that bag back .
it' s back at our hotel .
yeah .
i didn' t know about a bag of luggage .
well , i don' t .
why did you say it ?
i' m stalling .
this is all your fault .
what are they talking about ?
okay , okay .
okay .
please !
break it up .
man !
please , okay ?
you know ?
every time women get together they go like this all the time .
we' re just gonna go to the hotel , get the bag ... and we' re gonna bring it to you .
yes .
not so fast , senorita smiles .
victor' s coming with you .
huh ?
no , no , no .
that' s really not necessary .
he coming too ?
wha ...
i ...
hey , hey , hey .
i gotta put ice on my jaw , okay ?
i really don' t wanna take a ride with them , all right ?
you know what ?
you are going , unless you wanna stay here and explain this to the boss .
and i know you don' t really wanna do that , do you ?
nice move .
is that a plan ?
what are we gonna do when we get to the room and there' s no money ?
yeah , then what ?
you got us into this mess .
here we are .
there' s a note !
here , i' il get it .
i' il get it .
if you want your papi back , bring the money to the don quixote puppet ... at the l. a. latin festival at 5 : 00 p . m . , no cops .
no cops ?
l. a. latin festival ... this is all your fault .
why is everything my fault ?
it' s not my fault .
hey , hey !
keep it down , please .
where is the bag , because that' s not the bag .
it' s full of underwears and stuff .
where' s the bag ?
we didn' t have to leave tomas to return stupid car ... you' re miss perfect .
nothing is ever your fault !
shut up !
shut up so i can think .
please !
what ?
i live in new york .
no one touches my bag .
it' s like i' m seeing you for the very first time .
that was good .
but where is tomas ?
and who are these thugs and what was in that car ?
i don' t know , but i' m going to find out .
conga room .
fala .
cici !
i need to find that jerk , ricky .
i don' t know where he is .
are you in l. a. ?
have you see the hollywood sign ?
he set us up .
do you know about a bag of money that was supposed to be in the car ?
no .
ricky wouldn' t do anything like that .
he doesn' t have any money .
have you seen any movie stars ?
i don' t have time for this .
good bye .
take pic ...
well ?
well ?
we have to find out how to get to this festival .
miss puerto rico !
we' ve been calling and calling !
i was so worried !
i love your glasses !
but this is a beauty contest .
lose them !
it' s just you and me .
let' s go .
excuse me !
we need a map of the area .
how nice to have you back .
shall we give it another go ?
that was just a little misunderstanding .
of course .
what about the map ?
whose adorable dog is that ?
hotel policy does not allow ... our four legged family members to stay with us .
fifi , what' s wrong ?
oh , i' ve seen a lot , but this one' s a real doozy .
no , i think he' il prove very useful to us .
yeah .
okay , i' il see you there .
i' m just gonna make sure they make it there too .
okay .
bye .
and worldpeace .
excuse me .
miss mexico , how would you define beauty ?
i believe beauty does come from within ... but why not let your beauty show on the outside ... and share it with the whole world ?
if you got it , flaunt it .
and like the great daisy fuentes said , " we must all express our salsa gene ...
because it allows us to be ... as beautiful as we are .
muchas gracias .
thank you , miss mexico .
truly a voice of our generation .
ladies and gentlemen , it is my pleasure now to introduce to you ...
miss ...
puerto rico .
miss puerto rico !
hello .
fifi , what is it ?
come here .
come here .
aw , they let you have a dog ?
how nice .
nobody let' s me do anything .
i' m not a maid .
not a maid .
you know , you just keep tellin' yourself that .
i wake up every morning and i say to myself in the mirror ...
i am a musician .
fifi , what is it baby ?
come here .
would you stop fooling around with that dog ?
the money .
the bag , it really was in the trunk .
i put fifi' s toy inside , thinking it was my bag , but really it was the money bag .
it looks like my bag , but it was last year' s .
the clasp is different .
sorry .
we don' t have time for this .
let' s get miss puerto rico , and rescue tomas .
oh , man ... how can three defenseless girls get away from you ?
i dunno what happened .
they pushed me .
they kicked me .
what ?
i don' t know what happened !
victor , i' m not ready to die yet , i' m miserable .
and if we don' t get that money , we' re dead .
now look .
we ... we gotta find these broads .
okay .
okay , rodrigo .
don' t yell at me .
i think they' re at the don quixote puppet .
the don quixote puppet at the festival ?
yeah .
i' il meet you there .
when women realize that we are the majority of this world ... the possibilities are endless , but it is up to us .
i believe that as women ...
check out the wonder bread .
excuse you .
come on .
in every aspect of our lives , right ?
how would you respond to those who say a beauty contest such as this ... does more for the object ifiication of women , rather than women' s rights ?
i say , what better way to show that a woman can be both beautiful and intelligent ?
in fact , if chosen , i plan to propose ... that all beauty contestants are required to take entrance exams .
absolutely !
what the hell is she talking about ?
our goal , people , should be to celebrate the diverse ... and the wonderful qualities of today' s latin woman .
we don' t have time for this .
in fact , i believe ...
stop that imposter !
i am the real miss puerto rico .
i' m so sorry .
just a little misunderstanding ...
and that' s my ...
that wasn' t very dignified for a beauty queen .
anyway , what would tell me to go see tomas ?
i can explain this whole thing .
we really don' t have time for this .
what happened ?
whoo !
what were you doing up there ?
it was amazing , cici .
i really had them .
they were hanging on my every word .
girl , it wasn' t words they were hangin ' on .
i learned from you .
lorena !
lorena !
hey , we found the money .
really ?
let' s go .
we have to get to that festival ... or we don' t know what' s going to happen to tomas .
i hope he' s okay .
we have to find a puppet ...
i' m losing my mind .
welcome back .
where am i ?
who are you ?
agent carmen rivera , f. b. i.
f. b. i. ?
i i it ... it' s a federal crime to date three women ?
no , but it should be .
i' m missing out on the whole contest .
you' re a liar !
get over it !
yeah , focus , lorena .
got the map ?
got it .
floor it !
what' s happening ?
buckle up , romeo .
we' re going for a ride .
are you arresting me ?
no , you' re just the bait .
your girlfriends have something i want .
you know what ?
i think we' re gonna make it .
you know what ?
for a lawyer , you make a hell of a beauty contestant .
you know what ?
i don' t know what got into me .
i never had that kind of attention before .
it was amazing !
i bet if the real miss puerto rico hadn' t shown up , you would have won .
stop it .
you really think so ?
definitely .
you think so ?
you know what ?
for a cocktail waitress , she' s quite a mastermind .
street smart .
you , patty , you can really swing a lamp .
i know .
yeah .
yeah .
thank you .
thank you .
what was that ?
i don' t know .
what' s happening ?
we' re running out of gas !
cici !
we' re out of gas ?
and they were all there at my house .
can you believe that ?
well , you can' t say you didn' t have it coming .
nothing like this has ever happened before .
what ?
getting caught ?
no , falling in love with three women .
oh , love .
you call it love , hmm ?
si , like neruda ...
i love in this way , because i don' t know any other way of loving .
oh , my god .
you gotta be kidding me .
we' re not gonna make it .
then we' il go to a gas station !
there' s a gas station .
pull into the gas station .
i see the gas station !
this isn' t full service .
this isn' t full service .
are you out of your mind ?
hurry !
hurry !
perfect !
we don' t have time for this .
we need another ride .
are you with me ?
ahead of you .
you know how to do it ?
i don' t know how to drive that thing .
you don' t ?
no !
what would i ...
i thought you did .
why would i know how to drive a motorcycle ?
why would i ?
' cause it seemed implied !
do you wanna argue , or do you wanna ride ?
she doesn' t know how to pump gas ... but she knows how to drive a motorcycle .
vamonos !
and she speaks spanish .
hold on , chicas !
sorry !
we have to save someone' s lifie !
hey , wait !
that' s my bike !
we promise to bring it back !
sad girls .
talkin ' ' bout bad girls .
maybe through my childhood .
i was raised by so many women .
mi madre , mis tias , and three other sisters .
that' s interesting .
that' s why the amount of women never seem to be a problem .
that' s it .
that' s it exactly !
you understand .
you are so smart .
know what you need ?
you need to spend some time alone .
you shouldn' t cover your beautiful eyes with such dark glasses .
sit back .
what ?
you have beautifiul eyes .
i hope you girls know that stealing is illegal .
my mother' s definitely gonna kill me this time .
we' re gonna give it back , okay ?
yeah .

cici , those were expensive !
they look great .

hmm .
he turned out to be good bait .
i knew the perps would follow their money and the girls would follow their man .
i drove a harley , just like you taught me .
it was so cool .
i was miss puerto rico .
she was so beautiful !
i' m sorry .
i' m really sorry .
i never meant for this to happen .
i fell in love with all of you .
i don' t think i could ever choose .
choose ?
tomas , i have been out of control for , like , 36 hours now .
i' ve finally broken free of my parents .
i know what' s best for me .
so fifi and i , we' re gonna go it on our own now .
sorry .
ayayay , tomas .
what you did was very wrong .
but i ' m gonna thank you , because i' ve done things i' ve never dreamt of doing .
i realized that i don' t need you to feel sexy ... and to have fun with my life , so if you' re thinking of choosing me , mm mmm .
don' t .
and you , cicita ?
ay , papi .
suddenly it seems like i can do anything .
what i really wanna do is dance .
i think the world is ready for me now .

i' m sorry .
good bye , baby !
tomas , it looks like they made the choice for you , huh ?
yeah .
i' m taking your advice , carmen .
i' m going to spend some time alone .
good for you .
but before i do ... would you like to get some dinner ?
