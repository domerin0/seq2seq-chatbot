oh , but it was won' th it .

i knew we were smart to save those parts .
this copperbottom will do great things for the world , i can feel it .
honey ?
what ?
what' s that extra piece ?
oh , no , they always put in an extra ...
we did want a boy , right ?
this won' t hurt a bit , son .
got your nose .
got your nose .
got your ...
hi , son .
are those my big boy parts ?
they sure are .
they' re not shiny .
well , they' re not brand new .
they' re preowned .
so ...
they' re hand me downs from your cousin jeffrey .
and they' re only for a year .
hey , dad , who' s that ?
that , rodney , is bigweld .
the greatest robot in the world .
i thought you were the greatest robot in the world .
no , besides me .
he' s the head of bigweld industries .
he invents things that make everyone' s life better .
could i meet him ?
sure , maybe someday .
dad ?
yeah ?
what do you do ?
me ?
i work in a big , fancy restaurant .
i' m a dishwasher .
and now , live from robot city , it' s the bigweld show .
oh , yeah !
come on , dad , you' re missing it .
all right , rodney .
all right , i' m coming .
i' m coming .
i had to bring work home with me again , i' m sorry .
mr. gunk has really been piling it on .
and now , the host of our show , bigweld .
welcome .
this week i thought you' d like to take a look around bigweld industries .
this here is the front gate .
kind of cute , ain ' t it ?
good morning , tim .
good morning , mr. bigweld , sir .
tim , who closed the front gate ?
well , i just thought since ...
we never shut the gate , tim .
shutting this gate means shutting out fresh ideas .
see , every day , robots come here from hither and yon ... ... bringing us new ideas .
and i listen to every single one of them .
so remember , whether a bot is made of new parts , old parts or spare parts ... ... you can shine no matter what you' re made of .
he' s talking to me , dad .
he sure is , son .
he sure is .
okay , folks , let' s get to inventing .
you know , i love to tinker ... ... but all the tinkering in the world isn ' t useful unless it starts with a good idea .
so look around for a need and start coming up with ideas to fill that need .
one idea will lead to another , and before you know it ... ... you' ve done it .
see a need , fill a need .
that' s it , dad .
i have to look for ... ... a need .
easy , now .
hey there , sport .
oh , hi .
these are your 12 year old parts .
they' re ...
hand me downs .
i know , dad .
i don' t mind .
they are from your cousin ... ... veronica .
you know how popular she is .
thanks .
oh , hey .
hey .
soon as you reach the age where your warranty expires , you start falling apart .
pretty soon there' s gonna be more duct tape than me .
can i try it now , dad ?
oh , rodney ...
have you worked all the kinks out of it ?
this is gonna make your job easy .
i invented it for you .
okay .
let' s try it .
great .
okay , this is it .
wonderbot , go to work .
yeah , yeah .
hey !
copperbottom !
mr. gunk .
what is that ?
oh , that .
my son made it .
what' s it doing ?
mr. gunk , please , you' re making it nervous .
it' s wrecking my kitchen !
i' il stop it .
no !
your son , huh ?
it wasrt his fault .
he had nothing to do with it .
yes , sir , he' s a brilliant boy .
an inventor .
you , clean up this mess .
and , you , get out .
inventor .
you' re the hand me down son of a dishwasher , and that' s all you' il ever be .
somebody scrape this crud off of me .
and serve it to the customers .
roundtrip or one way ?
one way .
there you are .
i told you i' d find him .
it' s a mother' s instinct .
instinct ?
i' m leaving .
i' il be at the train station .
never mind .
pick up that suitcase .
you' re coming home .
no , mom .
i have to do this .
i' m going to robot city tonight .
i' m gonna get a job and i' m gonna help dad pay back mr. gunk .
talk to him .
ro ...
robot city ?
you' re just a kid .
i' m never gonna be someone here .
i wanna be an inventor .
i wanna meet bigweld .
i wanna be somebody .
you are somebody .
somebody who' s not getting on that train .
yes , i am .
talk to him .
one ticket for robot city .
where are you going ?
not me .
him .
but ...
rodney , did you know that when i was your age , i wanted to be a musician ?
i played pretty well too ... ... but my dad was worried i wouldn' t be able to make a living .
so i got refitted to be a dishwasher .
now , i' m not complaining .
but i' ve always said to myself ... ... if i could do it over again , i would follow my dream .
you' ve got greatness in you , rodney .
never doubt it .
you go to robot city .
you go meet bigweld , and you show him your big ideas .
and , rodney ... ... never , never give up .
all aboard .
mom .
i won' t let you down , dad .
i' il make you proud .
i know you will .
excuse me , i wonder if ...
gave at the office .
i wonder if you ...
could you direct me to bigweld indust ... ?
what ?
perfect .
that will be 50 bucks .
fifty bucks ?

a beautiful picture of your first moment in robot city .
there .
your second moment .
that' s another $50 .
are you keeping track ?
come on , work with me , work with me .
more pout , less pose .

inside of you is a fashion model waiting to throw up .

big eyes , big eyes .
give me big anime eyes .
yeah !
loving it , loving it , loving it !
i don' t want any pictures .
you don' t ?
no .
that' s all right .
there' s no film .
would you like a map to the stars ' homes ?
where did he go ?
buddy , wanna buy a watch ?
don' t buy us , we' re fakes .
next .
excuse me , how do i get to bigweld industries ?
oh , great ...
never mind .
hi , excuse me .
how do i get to bigweld industries ?
what ?
yeah , thanks .
cross town express to foundry district ... ... with stops at bigweld industries and battery park only .
please tighten all spools , nuts , bolts and detachable appendages .
riders with high oil pressure are advised to take the local .
thank you , and have a nice day .
no , no .
say , are you following me ?
no .
first time on the cross town express ?
well , actually , i ...
oh , boy .
good luck in the big city .
if you can make it here , you can make it anywhere .
and if you can' t make it here , welcome to the club .
oh , no .
what ?
what is it ?
we' re going off the track .
we' re gonna crash !
what ?
i don' t wanna die .
i was just kidding .
just put your head between your legs .
yeah !
there goes my stop .
i tell you , the things that fall off me ...
it' s embarrassing .
sorry .
you know , it used to be a lot worse .
they had this giant hammer ...
oh , they brought it back .
stick with me .
i know this town like the back of my hand .
hey , that' s new .
excuse me .
can i help you ?
sorry , i ...
hey , you' re tim from the tv show .
that' s me .
well , hey , tim .
who closed the gate ?
it' s never supposed to be ...
yeah , okay , what do you want ?
i' d like to see mr. bigweld .
i' m an inventor .
oh , why didn' t you say so ?
stand back .
thanks .
what ?
i got you .
you see , because you were all excited and then , boom !
all right , i had my laugh .
go on in .
now , that' s funny .
the second time .
you really think i' m gonna let you in .
but i' m not .
sorry , kid , nobody gets in .
company rules .
company ru ... ?
well , then how do they hire new inventors ?
they don' t .
those days are over .
come back two years ago .
then the job is yours .
so remember , whether a bot is made of new parts , old parts or spare parts ... ... you can shine no matter what you' re made of .
my goodness , what a remarkable legacy .
concern for the common robot .
you don' t come across old fashioned values like that anymore , friends .
and for good reason .
there' s no money in it !
hello ?
we' re not a charity .
that' s why old fat face no longer sits in the big chair .
he' s a relic .
so i don' t wanna hear another , " where' s bigweld ?
we' il see him next month at the bigweld ball .
he always goes to that .
now , let' s get down to the business of sucking every loose penny ... ... out of mr. and mrs. average knucklehead .
what' s our big ticket item ?
upgrades , people .
upgrades .
that' s how we make the dough .
now , if we' re telling robots that no matter what they' re made of , they' re " fine " ... ... how can we expect them to feel crummy enough about themselves ... ... to buy our upgrades and make themselves look better ?
therefore , i' ve come up with a new slogan .
why be you when you can be new ?
i gotta tell you , i think it' s brilliant ... ... but , honestly , i' d like to hear what you employees think about this .
hear , hear .
out of the ballpark , ratchet .
just don' t look down .
hey .
get off .
go on , get off .
get off of ...
cappy , you haven' t said a word .
it gave me chills .
thank you , thank you .
but ...
but ?
i' m just wondering , why would robots buy new upgrades ... ... if parts are so much cheaper ?
oh , right .
well , that' s easy .
because as of today , we are no longer making spare parts .
do you know what i call robots who can' t afford upgrades ?
scrap metal .
you see them on the streets , misshapen and rust covered .
they turn your insides out .
you wanna run home and scrub yourself .
now , cappy , i want your department to push our new slogan .
in fact , i' m moving you into the office right next to mine .
we' il be working very , very closely together on this one .
wort that be fun ?
oodles .
oh , so sorry , i ...
what the ... ?
sir , i am a young inventor , and it has been my dream to come to robot city ... ... and to present my ideas to mr. bigweld .
who doesn' t seem to be here .
gee , no , no .
but while he' s away , he left me in charge .
oh , well , then let me show you what this can do .
i have a better idea .
why don' t you let me show you what it can do .
it can do this !
so how did it go ?
what the heck is going on around here ?
some highly polished jerk is sitting in bigweld' s chair .
and you' re sitting on the sidewalk , magnetized .
listen , i' il be back , and i' m gonna get to the bottom of this .
when you pick a lost cause , you really commit .
where do they make dreamers like you ?
get lost , freak !
all right , break time .
all right , break time' s over .
chop chop .
look who' s here .
hi , mom .
hi , sweetie .
how' s my boy ?
great .
i did just what you told me .
no more spare parts .
in a couple of weeks , those broken down losers out there will be scrap metal .
you will be up to your bloomers in broken elbow junk .
such a good boy .
and after you finish off bigweld ... ... there will be nobody out there to fix them .
exactly !
you wanna swing that one by me again ?
idiot !
those outmodes look up to him .
suppose he decides to come back ?
oh , come on , mom .
he' s not gonna be trouble where he is .
what are you afraid of ?
grow some bolts .
or do you want to end up like your father ?
hey , son .
good to see you .
think what it would mean .
not bigweld industries , ratchet industries .
keep talking .
ratchet city !
yes , everything shiny .
no more bigweld , no more outmode .
let' s do it !
that' s my boy !
are you hungry ?
can i get you something ?
you look thin .
no , no , no , mom .
i gotta go .
bye .
bye , pop .
so long , son .
good luck with your dastardly plans .
hey .
hi there .
listen , if i seem to be getting smaller , it' s because i' m leaving .
foot , don' t fail me now .
stop !
hey , you got my foot !
oh , great .
happy now ?
not until you give me back my foot , you mugger .
i am not a mugger .
i happen to be ... ... a scrounger .
i didn' t know you were at the end of that foot .
here , let me help you with that .
no , no , no , i' il do it myself .
i have my pride , you know .
over here .
oh , no .
no , not that close .
hold on , hold on .
no .
no , no .
what' s the use ?
there' s nothing left .
hey , diesel , i found you a voice box .
here' s another one .
that' s no good .
give me that .
i can never find parts in my size .
what is it , boy ?
hey , fender , have you lost weight ?
lost weight ?
look at where you' re looking .
he' s a head in a basket .
we' re doomed , i knew it .
we' re doomed .
yeah , will you shut up , you neurotic nut ?
why , i' d smack you if i had a hand .
wow , speak of the devil , here i come .
dang !
check this out .
who would throw away such a cute little doodad ?
don' t be scared .
hey , that' s mine .
that' s him .
that' s the guy .
i would know that face .
i know that face , and i know that foot .
he' s over there , moron .
that' s the perpetrator .
he knocked my head off .
you want another piece of me ?
all right , buster .
if you think you can mess with my big brother , you' re ...
you' re kind of cute .
piper , would you behave yourself .
now , come on , let' s get fender fixed .
again .
here' s your thingamabob .
by the way , the name' s piper .
rhymes with " viper .
see you around .
don' t talk to strange men .
thank you , manuel .
i talk to you .
who' s stranger than that ?
i got good news , and i got bad news .
what' s the bad news ?
i checked the stock book .
and as of today , they are no longer making parts for your model .
you have been officially outmoded .
outmoded ?
well , that' s fine .
what' s the good news ? !
well , when we had your parts , they were on sale .
how could this happen to me ?
i' m practically a kid .
look , pull yourself together .
all you need is an upgrade .
that new upgrade smell .
just came in , fully loaded .
look .
it' s got cup holders , standard .
does it come in plus sizes ?
sure , take a look at the new bigweld spring collection .
i can' t afford that fancy stuff .
all i need is one stinking neck joint .
no .
why did this happen to me ?
i' m hurting me .
idiot .
sorry , pal , it' s either upgrade or the chop shop for you .
the chop shop ?
i' m fine , i' m fine .
look , no hands .
ta da !
i' m back .
miss me ?
no one' s going to the chop shop .
that' s right .
what do you think we can get for him ?
will you stop ?
listen , shiny pants ... ... you get back there and find a part for my brother .
we are not junk , we are not scrap , and we will not be treated this way .
i' m sorry .
i don' t have the parts .
well , do you have two washers , an s spring and some fastweld ?
i can fix you easy .
the force is strong with this one .
when was the last time you got oiled ?
i can' t answer that with my kid sister here .
can it , fender .
hold still .
this might tickle .
we haven' t been properly introduced .
i' m fender .
used to be bumper ... ... but had to change it when we came in to the country .
copperbottom , rodney copperbottom .
why did i meet you among the garbage ?
well , today i tried to get in to see bigweld .
well , if you find him , tell him we really need him to come back .
he cared about bots like us .
i heard they' ve done him in and left the rest of us to fall apart .
well , that ought to do it .
look at that !
and he fixed my neck .
sweeper !
sweeper ?
make yourself scarce .
what' s the big deal ?
well , if you' re an outmode like fender ...
hey .
they sweep you up and take you to the chop shop .
where they melt you down and turn you into something else .
you mean ... ?
yep .
sweepers .
sweepers .
help .
here' s one outmode you' re not gonna get .
fender , run !
that was close .
when in robot city , guests of the rusties ...
that' s us .
beats rusting outside .
let me just let her know you' re here .
aunt fanny !
we brought someone .
i' m in the kitchen .
are you sure your aunt won' t mind ?
relax , she' s not my aunt .
she just takes in bots who are broke .
bless her little heart .
well , then why is she called aunt fanny ?
we couldn' t call her aunt booty .
oh , crap .
she' s a little artsy fartsy .
the artsy' s okay , but when she gets fartsy ...
look at ...
oh , right on my shoes .
i' m so clumsy .
well , hello there .
what' s your name ?
i' m rodney bigbottom ...
no , i' m rodney copperbottom .
copperbottom .
that' s a wonderful name , bigbottom .
well , i just ...
what happened to your friend ?
he' s been rear ended .
oh , there you are .
aunt fanny , he needs a place to stay .
well , just make yourself at home .
thank you .
that' s very kind of you .
my pleasure .
see a need , fill a need .
hey , just like bigweld .
bigweld .
that' s a lot of robot .
come on .
you can bunk with me .
we' il ignore the gossip .
you missed a spot .
fender , get out of my room !
i' m not in your room .
i am now .
now i' m not .
i am .
not .
am ...
get out of my room .
oh , man , this is my third oil change today .
something' s wrong with me .
sorry .
here we are .
home sweet home .
what' s mine is yours .
oh , dear .
i' il get them .
look at that .
now they' re arm wrestling .
could you separate them ?
hurry , my backside itches .
i know that sounds bad , but i' m just doing musical arm farts .
you know how to do those ?
they' re hard to do , because we' re metal , but that' s where the skill comes in .
i' m real close .
listen .
no , wait .
no , wait , wait .
you can' t tell me that didn' t sound like a ...
like an old man .
you know , i' m a little tired .
maybe tomorrow .
kind of a rough day , huh ?
kind of .
my dad' s probably sitting by the phone ... ... waiting for his brilliant son to call ... ... and tell him what a big success my first day was .
i know it' s not your problem .
if you burden your friends , you won' t have any .
what are you , a fortune cookie ?
that' s what friends ...
you consider me a friend ?
sure , what else would i consider you ?
an embarrassment , a way to rebel against your parents ... ... a desperate cry for help .
the list is endless .
let' s just stick with friend .
you know , even though you had a discouraging day , remember ... ... there' s another one coming tomorrow .
you know , my last roommate jumped out that window .
hey , fender .
yeah , baby .
let it rip !
guys , come on , what are you , 3 years old ?
this is how a man does it .
you guys are so gross .
besides , this is how you do it .
hey , kids , get a load of this .
aunt fanny ... ... we were using our arms .
oh , excuse me .
lady , please ... ... see a doctor .
breakfast .
this will perk everyone up .
some of aunt fanny' s fresh brewed grease .
yummy !
careful , it' s hot .
so , what are you guys doing today ?
we' re doing it .
what about you ?
bigweld' s disappeared , and you' re sitting here .
that' s already been established .
i gotta find out what happened to him .
hey , you want my advice ?
sure .
forget it .
never try , never fail .
those are the words i live by .
crank , the idol of millions is gone , and no one seems to care .
there should be an angry mob out there .
what the ... ?
wow , that was great , psychic friend .
now say , " money should be falling from the sky .
say it .
say it .
sorry , folks , all sold out .
nothing but upgrades from here on in .
but i like myself just the way i am .
we can' t afford upgrades !
let' s get him !
hey , hey , hey , what are you doing ?
don' t throw me .
isn' t that the guy that fixed fender' s neck ?
yeah , that guy fixes bots .
yeah , that kid can help you .
brace yourself .
you' re about to get popular .
only those with insurance .
oh , i forgot .
everybody , come on .
parts , man .
i need parts .
you don' t look that ... bad .
hey , everybody , spare parts !
yeah !
wait a minute .
wait a minute .
what' s wrong with you robots ?
you should all be ashamed of yourselves .
why do you have two noses ?
one' s for showing , one' s for blowing .
sorry .
hey , could you look at my arm ?
nice grip .
like iron .
i can' t get rid of this spare tire .
i am losing my mind .
back off , back off .
he' s got his own dreams that won' t come true .
see a need , fill a need .
wait .
who wants to get fixed ?
thanks , rodney .
you' re number one .
rodney !
rodney !
rodney !
oh , yeah .
i have never felt so relaxed .
say , do you mind giving me a little scratch between the shoulder blades ?
there you ...
easy , tiger .
hey !
take it easy .
hey , what are you trying to do , kill me ?
relax .
it' s me , your mommy .
how did you get in here ?
i came up the air shaft .
i know you don' t like anybody here to see me .
well , what do you want ?
someone' s fixing them .
what ?
someone is repairing outmodes ... ... and they are laughing at you .
who ?
and are you sure they' re not laughing with me ?
yes .
so what if one crazy fanatic repairs a few outmodes ?
who cares ?
think .
use those brains i stole for you .
today , it' s one .
what about tomorrow , when everybody gets the idea this is okay ?
we can fix ourselves .
we don' t need upgrades .
we want bigweld .
then what happens to you ?
okay , okay .
take it easy .
we' ve got to find out who this is and stop him .
not stop him , crush him , destroy him .
and by the way , i brought you a little something for your desk .
is there anyone else waiting ?
let me look .
a few .
" a few " ?
what did you expect , rodney ?
bigweld was gone .
sweepers were on the loose , but then came copperbottom .
i' m getting all static y just thinking about it .
i' m not bigweld .
these robots need parts .
mail call .
mail call .
copperbottom , this one' s from your mom .
oh , is there anything for me ?
oh , i got something for you .
that' s from my sister .
i recognize the handwriting .
is anything wrong ?
i' il say .
his father' s got one foot in the junkyard ... ... and if they can' t find new parts for him , he' s only got a few miles left .
rodney , are you really worried about your dad ?
do you wanna go home ?
well , if i go home , i still can' t help him .
we' re out of parts .
we' ve gotta get to bigweld .
he' s the only one that can fix this .
he' s trying to tell us something .
what is it , boy ?
what' s wrong ?
bigweld is going ... ... dancing .
of course , the bigweld ball .
you can' t have the bigweld ball without bigweld .
well , that' s it , then .
i' m going to the bigweld ball .
what ?
that' s the fanciest party of the year .
you' il never get past the gate .
can i help you ?
i think maybe you can .
this is count roderick von brokenzipper .
formerly count velcro .
where are the trumpets ?
we were promised trumpets to announce the count' s arrival .
sorry , your grace .
beat me until you' re happy .
he' s happy .
and i' m not feeling too bad myself .
let me ...
you' re not on the list .
we' re what ?
once again .
thank you .
fine , we will go .
you' il explain to your superiors ... ... why we were not able to attend your little luau , barn dance , whatever it is .
but we' re leaving in a huff .
no , no .
no .
please , go right in .
in fact , would the count like to hit me ?
the count hit you ?
the arrogance of some people .
i will hit you on his behalf .
thank you , your grace .
okay , let' s split up .
if you see bigweld , come and find me .
if anything goes wrong , we' il signal each other .
what kind of signal do you want ?
ricola !
subtle .
let' s get to work .
a screwdriver , please .
shaken , not stirred .
yes , sir .
i' il have what he' s having .
you know , cappy , it' s nice that you can see me like this , away from work .
see my more casual , fun ioving side .
now , where were we ?
well , there are never any interesting men at these parties .
hello , ladies .
fender von fender at your service .
hi , i' m loretta ... ... geargrinder .
anyone dressed as badly as you are must be an eccentric billionaire .
ladies and gentlebots , now coming to the stage ... ... the top bot , the big bolt ... ... who' s your daddy ?
mr. phineas t. ratchet .
thank you .
we now come to the point of the evening ... ... where i have the tremendous honor of introducing ...
excuse me .
sorry . ... our beloved founder , mr. bigweld ... ... who , unfortunately , is unable to attend .
what ?
he sends his apologies ... ... his love and a small box of assorted cookies .
not coming ?
and what are you doing here ?
what have you done with bigweld ?
how come we don' t see him anymore , huh ?
okay .
security , we have a party crasher .
yeah , that' s right , and i had to put all this junk on in order to get in here ... ... so that i could tell bigweld that you are outmoding millions of bots .
and i know because i spend all day fixing them .
you .
oh , my darling , that is the cry of the deep doo doo bird .
i must fly .
take him for a drive ... ... and bring me back his exact weight in paper clips .
no !
no ?
i' il escort him out .

hey , tim , i' d like to see mr. bigweld .
oh , you again .
oh , that was amazing .
so where do we go now ?
i' m taking you to the train station .
what ?
no way .
you don' t know what you' re dealing with .
ratchet will use your head for a hood ornament .
i' m not leaving until i find bigweld .
that' s not ...
can' t you take me to him ?
i must be out of my mind .
au rservoir , my darling .
thanks for walking me home .
thanks for carrying me up that hill .
until tomorrow ?
i shall count the seconds .
so far , i' m up to four .
you crazy nut boy .
crazy about you .
i' m singing in the oil
i' m singing in the oil
after all that work and toil
i' m just slipping in the oil
i know where i' ve been sent
i' m covered in lubricant
my life has turned around .
from now on , i' m a winner !
stop , you' ve made a mistake .
i' m alive .
you can' t do this .
help .
okay , we tried .
let' s get out of here .
no , no , no .
something' s up .
look at all these newspapers and this mail .
come on .
they probably stopped delivering these years ago .
paper .
late edition .
you say something ?
nice one of you .
come on .
we gotta get you out of here .
big , creaky door .
perfect .
look at this .
this is bigweld' s actual workshop .
i recognize it from his old tv show .
could you keep it down ?
we' re not supposed to be here .
do you know what these are ?
these are bigweld' s original invention designs .
that' s his own writing .
this is strange .
how come it just stops in the middle ?
look at this .
remember , he used to have these on his show ?
rodney , i don' t know how to tell you this , but ...
why are they so dusty ?
wait , don' t .
this is much more elaborate than the ones on his show .
rodney , what do we do ?
i don' t know .
this is kind of a first for me .
yeah !
it' s him .
who' s the king of the beach ?
are you all right ?
well , considering i' m an old fat guy who just crashed to the floor ... ... i' m fantastic .
now , who the heck are you ?
i' m rodney .
oh , i thought you were the dominoes delivery boy .
come on , let' s set them up again , only bigger .
sir , is this what you' ve been working on ?
this is why no one sees you ?
young man , nobody likes a chatterbox .
but there' s a terrible crisis , mr. bigweld .
we need to talk .
son , i' ve gotta tell you , you' re making a lousy first impression .
please , sir , he is your biggest fan .
in fact , he' s an inventor just like you .
well ...
show him that thing you made .
a device ?
a doohickey ?
a thingamajig ?
now , don' t be scared .
show mr. bigweld what you can do .
go on .
it' s okay .
is that what it' s supposed to do ?
it gets nervous under pressure ...
son , let me give you a good piece of advice .
yes ?
give up .
what ?
you' re telling me to quit ?
i said " give up , " but " quit " works just as good .
is that what you did ?
is that why you' re sitting here ... ... letting ratchet turn robots like my father into outmodes ?
kid , sometimes you just gotta know when you' re licked .
but you' re bigweld .
you can fix anything .
i used to think so .
to me , having the company was all about making life better .
with ratchet , it was making money that came first .
i became old fashioned , an outmode .
go home , kid .
if he beat me , he' s gonna beat you .
the world you' re looking for no longer exists .
you missed it .
find some other foolish dream .
now , if you' il excuse me , i' m very , very ... ... very busy .
yeah , i can see that .
all i ever wanted was to grow up to be like him .
help .
open the door .
open the door .
close the door .
close the door !
wow , look at all these parts .
it' s a smorgasbord .
look at that .
so many things i' ve wanted all my life .
oh , that' s pretty .
okay , mother , this way .
let me look , please .
i can' t bear it .
no peeking , now .
it' s a surprise .
oh , you are a wicked boy .
and look .
for me ?
it' s got a full tank of gas .
if you' re ready to mow , she' s ready to go .
has any mother ever had a better son ?
by the way , i found out who' s been fixing those outmodes .
so tomorrow , these babies ... ... are gonna chop him up along with all his buddies ... ... and every other walking pile of junk i' m sick of looking at .
what' s that ?
this is so wrong .
this is so wrong .
help .
help !
rivet town , please .
one way .
hi , mom .
oh , i' m doing fine .
how are you ?
and dad ?
he' s right here .
i' il put him on .
hey , buddy , how' s it going ?
hey , dad .
how are you feeling ?
oh , fine , fine .
i ...
i' ve just been a little under the weather .
no , we' re just having a little trouble ... ... finding your old man a replacement part , that' s all .
but let' s talk about you .
what kind of work are you doing ?
what' s bigweld like ?
did you meet him ?
yeah , i met him , but ...
what' s wrong , son ?
it' s not how we thought it was , dad .
it' s not ...
i can' t ...
i see .
i' m really sorry i let you down .
no , no , no .
you could never let me down , rodney .
listen , i know it isn' t easy , rodney ... ... but a dream that you don' t fight for ... ... can haunt you for the rest of your life .
yeah , dad .
it' s up to you , son .
your father loves you very much .
i know .
with our friends and family plan , you can talk to him 500 minutes a month .
free nights and weekends .
yoo hoo , rodney !
wait .
your suitcase .
thanks , aunt fanny , but i' m ...
the others wanted to come and see you off too .
well , why didn' t they ?
oh , they did .
next time , let' s split a cab .
who the heck is she ?
i used to have a figure like that .
hurry , come on .
one ticket to anywhere .
fender ?
i have a sister .
an ugly sister .
hey , guess what .
it' s the sweepers .
they' re rounding up outmodes and taking them ...
what " them " ?
us .
to madame gasket' s chop shop .
and guess who' s really behind it all .
ratchet .
you don' t wanna guess ?
i ran all this way in heels .
come on , take a stab .
ratchet .
ratchet !
listen to me .
listen to me .
we won' t last a week .
okay , okay .
settle down .
i got a plan .
let' s all get on that train .
come on .
hey , wait a minute .
you' re all giving up ?
you started it .
well , i' m ending it .
my mistake was hoping that bigweld would fight our battles .
well , he won' t .
it' s up to us .
if we don' t do something about ratchet , no one will .
come on , let' s fight back .
fighting never solved anything .
quitting isn' t so productive either .
i gotta tell you .
it' s the big boy .
oh , be still , my pump .
kid , if you' re gonna fight , i' m going in with you .
you ...
you are ?
hey , who' s the dame with the sweet keister ?
but why ?
i don' t know .
i' m a big guy , and i like women with large ...
no , no , no .
why are you gonna help us ?
because i wanna grow up to be like you .
then let' s do it .
come on , gang .
let' s give that ratchet an old school fix it !
oh , what a man .
someone get a crane .
mother , i' m an adult , okay ?
so stop telling me how to kill bigweld .
i' m doing it today ... ... how i want , where i want and with whatever i want .
okay , boardroom , 10 minutes .
i want you both there .
mr. bigweld , should we come too ?
no , no .
you stay here ... ... and watch daddy' s limo .
yes , sir .
i' m going inside to kick some booty .
hey , you know , your boyfriend here is a genius .
what ?
oh , he' s not my ...
he is ?
i am ?
thanks for still believing in me .
it' s good to be home .
toodley oodley !
i use the brazilian wax .
it makes me feel like every day' s a fiesta .
tell mr. ratchet his 10 : 00 is here .
i' m all over it .
yes , sir .
mr. bigweld , sir .
mr. bigweld , sir .
oh , mr. bigweld .
no , no .
tell him i' m not here .
tell him anything , just don' t let him in .
ratchet !
i' il cut to the point .
what happened ?
run out of dominoes ?
i' il send you more .
you' re fired !
fired ?
on what grounds ?
this company' s never been more profitable .
profit , schmofit .
now , get out .
no , wait , please listen to me .
you can' t do this to me .
this job is my life .
it means everything to me .
you don' t know what i' ve done to get here .
the lies i' ve told .
the lives i' ve ruined .
this isn' t helping me .
get me security .
wait , please .
can' t i just make one more heartfelt plea ?
okay , what did you wanna say ?
that .
oh , my gosh .
i' m as crazy as my mother .
take that fish to the chop shop and put my name on his parking space .
let go of him .
sure .
listen , kid , it' s over .
you lost .
bigweld is gonna be melted down into next seasors upgrades ... ... along with you , your moronic coffeepot and cappy .
such a waste .
mr. bigweld , are you okay ?
i' m the prettiest girl at the harvest moon ball .
i' il take that as a " no .
out of the way !
rodney .
road trip !
road trip !
road trip !
you guys are so embarrassing .
oh , that' s rodney .
he' s in some kind of trouble .
i' ve gotta repair him .
okay , i got your back .
come on , we' ve gotta help rodney .
no , piper , you stay here .
no way .
let' s be honest .
we' re headed for a huge butt whupping .
whatever happens to us , make something of yourself .
you' re the only thing i' ve got to leave behind .
goodbye !
he' s right , piper .
they' re headed for a huge butt whupping .
okay , got it !
rodney , what' s going on ?
where are we ?
it' s okay .
you' re all right .
okay , boys , we got them right where they want us .
boost me up .
watch your hands down there .
rodney !
we' re here to save you !
how do you think it' s going so far ?
the plug .
hold on , guys !
i gotta get to the other side .
we' re out of here !
the chop shop .
that' s it .
game over .
the game is not over .
this is our moment to shine .
this is where you show what you' re really made of .
in my case , it' s a rare metal .
it' s called " afraidium .
it' s yellow .
it tastes like chicken .
i didn' t know i could do that .
rodney' s right .
i am tired of just complaining and never doing anything .
l ...
i ...
i wanna try .
no .
forget it .
i' m sorry .
no .
yes !
i want to try .
then you' re first .
first for what ?
they want us to upgrade ?
then let' s upgrade .
gasket , you' re a sick , twisted , evil robot .
i try .
oh , good .
company .
so you' re the little glob of tin who' s been making all the trouble .
who are these losers ?
we , sir ...
i' m a woman .
ouch .
we' ve come to rescue our friend , you evil bag of bolts .
and you will be defeated by the very outmodes ... ... that you scorned and defaced .
yeah , because there' s seven of us and only one of you .
there' s seven of us and ...
eight , nine ...
did you count that one ?
i think so .
could you all stop moving around ? !
it' s so frustrating !
i think i counted one of you twice !
while you' re at it , count these .
as soon as we' re done with you , these hit the streets .
this is the last day any outmode will ever see .
did i miss the butt whupping ?
no .
matter of fact , you' re a little bit early .
rodney !
rodney !
rodney !
well , let' s get started .
testify , sister !
charge !
charge !
oh , no !
he' s got a steel chair .
but he' s back up into a neck breaker .
he' s up to the top rope .
look at the hang time !
that' s sure gonna leave a dent .
say hello to my dimpled friend .
this is gonna get greasy !
are you thinking what i' m thinking ?
i sure am .
see a need , fill a need !
this isn' t what i was thinking at all .
what are you doing ?

it' s very distracting .

mr. and mrs. copperbottom , i came all this way ... ... to tell you in person that your son , rodney ... ... the man who got me off my big titanium tochis ... ... is now my right hand bot and my eventual successor .
way to go , rodney !
oh , mom .
son .
