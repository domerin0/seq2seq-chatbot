my name is erwin fletcher .
i' m an investigative reporter for a los angeles paper .
you' ve probably read my stuff under the byline of jane doe .
i\ x9ds better than erwin .
recently i' ve been loitering around the beach ... trying to pass for a minor league junkie .
i don' t nod out or drool ; tha\ x9ds too obvious .
act like you don' t care and you fit right in .
business has really picked up .
i' m still closed .
is it a colombian national holiday ?
what do you figure , sam ?
no idea .
no idea at all ?
some idea .
like when ?
when it comes , it comes .
i got some reds .
you don' t mean communists , do you ?
is everything a joke to you , fletch ?
everything , sam .
hey , gummy !
hey , fletch .
hey , sam .
how' s the eye ?
i\ x9ds ok .
the cops did it .
they always beating up on me .
he doesn' t know .
son of a bitch !
tha\ x9ds what he said .
he doesn' t know ?
how come he doesn' t know ?
i don' t know .
he just doesn' t know .
son of a bitch !
i wonder how he gets the stuff .
i have no idea .
sam never leaves the beach .
he sits in that chair .
he' s out of shit .
suddenly he gets up , he' s got shit .
where' s it coming from ?
the sand ?
tha\ x9ds highly unlikely , grease .
i oughta get some sleep .
grease , how old are you ?
nineteen .
you' re not taking very good care of yourself .
if you haven' t guessed , there' s been a lot of drug traffic on the beach .
i' m not talking about no doze .
i talkin ' about the hard stuff .
a lot of it .
i' ve been trying to find out who' s behind it .
it hasn' t been easy .
i don' t shower much .
excuse me .
i have something i' d like to discuss with you .
wha\ x9ds that ?
we can' t talk about it here .
why not ?
because we can' t .
you on a scavenger hunt , or did i forget to pay my dinner check ?
come to my house to talk .
wrong gal , fella .
i' il give you $1, 000 cash .
what ?
come to my house and listen to the proposition .
if you reject the proposition , you keep the thousand ... and your mouth shut .
does this entail my dressing up as little bo peep ?
i\ x9ds nothing of a sexual nature .
yeah .
one thousand just to listen ?
how can you pass that up , mister ...
nugent .
ted nugent .
alan stanwyk .
alan , charmed .
for an extra grand , i' il let you take me out to dinner .
what a coincidence .
what ?
i almost bought this place .
then i found out hopalong cassidy killed himself here .
blew it for me .
who ?
hopalong cassidy .
bow and arrow .
very weird .
are you doped up ?
don' t talk to me like that .
i don' t work for you .
buenos das .
buenos das .
pup ' n ' taco .
oh , you' ve remodeled the garage .
must have cost you hundreds .
good idea .
i oughta frame mine .
will the pope be in later ?
here' s my proposition .
i' m all ears .
i want you to murder me .
here ... on thursday .
i' d like you to shoot me dead .
the reason i ask for this service ... is because i' m already facing a very long ... painful and most certain death .
you see , i have bone cancer .
i don' t know if you know about bone cancer .
i\ x9ds the worst kind you can get .
it just eats you up bit by bit .
you don' t look sick .
i don' t feel sick .
not yet .
i\ x9dil get bad in a month .
after that , i' d rather not be around for it .
why not try suicide ?
i' ve thought about it .
my company' s taken out a large life insurance policy on me .
suicide would nullify it , but murder does not .
why me ?
you' re a drifter .
a , uh ... pardon the expression ... a junkie .
nobody would notice if you disappeared .
i' ve been watching you for a couple of weeks .
maybe i' m just on vacation .
not with the scum you hang out with .
no , i' ve watched ... and i' ve thought .
i\ x9ds an elegant plan .
i' ve even figured out your escape .
swell .
has it ever occurred to you i might not want to murder you ?
i' ve got $50, 000 says you will .
50, 000 .
and a guarantee you won' t get caught .
i' m still here .
i want it done thursday around 8 : 00 p . m .
my wife will be out , and i\ x9ds the staff' s night off .
these will be open .
wouldn' t they normally be locked ?
sometimes .
the staff usually forgets .
i have the same trouble with my help .
i' il be here waiting for you .
the safe will be open .
there will be $50, 000 in it .
you' il be wearing rubber gloves .
do you own rubber gloves ?
i rent ' em .
i have a lease with an option to buy .
now in this drawer ...
ah !
a. 357 magnum .
my . 357 .
you use it .
no one can trace it to you .
the room will be in disarray .
like a burglary attempt ?
you come in and catch me stealing your ties and money ?
we scuffle .
the gun gets loose and i shoot you .
precisely .
are you a good shot ?
yeah , i' m all right .
get me on the first shot , if you can .
do you have a passport ?
can dig one up .
good .
now , after you kill me , take the jaguar .
the keys will be in the glove compartment .
take it where ?
l. a. x.
pan am will have a ticket for you .
where am i going ?
rio .
it departs at 11 p . m .
they serve dinner onboard ?
and a movie and drinks .
stay down there for a year .
so ?
so ...
you certainly thought this out .
i don' t leave a great deal to chance .
those will be open ?
take care of the gloves , the passport and the aim .
i' il handle everything else .
the gun , the money , the tickets ... and the dying .
tha\ x9ds right .
looks like you get the hard part .
what do you say ?
you' il be doing me a great service .
will you kill me ?
sure .
hey !
good to see you .
slouch , how are you ?
can i steal you ?
if you promise not to return me .
magic today ?
yeah , kareem' s in the wash .
i need a favor .
fletch !
did you hear something ?
see what we have on alan stanwyk in beverly hills .
i need this right away .
i take it the story' s done .
w y k.
tell me i' m right .
you' re right , but you' re very peaked .
want to vomit ?
come on in .
the story' s done , right ?
uh ... almost .
almost is not an answer .
yes is an answer .
and a damn fine answer .
professional journalism time now .
go back and finish the story !
frank , i will .
i swear it .
something came up .
you' ve got a deadline tomorrow .
did you see sunday' s ad ?
i don' t read the paper .
wha\ x9ds the spread on tonigh\ x9ds game ?
lakers by six .
take a look .
shame of the city .
tha\ x9ds very nice .
try to follow this .
you can' t run the ad and then not run the story .
you can' t ?
why not ?
shit .
really ?
i' m putting you on .
you' il get the story .
you' il be proud of it .
you broke it ?
you know the source ?
practically .
is it fat sam ?
you said you had pictures of him .
i do have pictures of him dealing .
le\ x9ds go .
we' il run them .
you can' t do that .
fat sam isn' t the story .
there' s a source behind him .
who ?
tha\ x9ds a gray area .
how gray ?
charcoal .
may i help you with that ?
ok .
a little lighter .
can you go higher ?
over to the right .
higher .
perfect .
nice and hard .
tha\ x9ds good .
thank you .
that it ?
perfect .
everything' s recent .
let me see that .
alan stanwyk , commercial airline pilot ... from provo , utah .
formerly a test pilot , member of the jaycees .
move on ?
yeah .
married boyd aviation .
he' s no dummy .
tha\ x9ds big bucks .
his parents are marvin and velma , were unable to attend the wedding .
marvin , velma and provo .
hold it there .
cancer .
cancer society benefit .
internist dr. joseph dolan .
i wonder if tha\ x9ds his doctor .
one way to find out .
there is .
where do you know alan from ?
we play tennis at the club .
california racquet club ?
right .
tha\ x9ds my club too .
i don' t remember seeing you there .
i haven' t been playing because of these kidney pains .
right .
how long have you had these pains , mr. barber ?
no , tha\ x9ds babar .
two b' s ?
one b.
b a b a r.
tha\ x9ds two .
yeah , but not together .
i thought tha\ x9ds what you meant .
arnold babar .
aren' t there children' s books ... about an elephant named babar ?
i don' t know .
i don' t have any .
no children ?
no , elephant books .
open wide .
say , ah .
aah .
i\ x9ds an odd name .
i haven' t seen it on the club registry .
i don' t formally belong .
i' m a guest of my aun\ x9ds .
your aunt ?
right .
mrs. smith .
joan or margaret ?
uh huh .
which one ?
margaret .
funny old bird .
i could tell you some stories .
i bet .
you know , i\ x9ds a shame about ed .
it was .
that was really a shame .
to go so suddenly .
he was dying for years .
but the end was very sudden .
he was in intensive care for eight weeks .
but the very end , when he actually died ... was extremely sudden .
alan and i were recently speaking of dying .
he told me boyd aviation took out a large insurance policy on him .
you' ve got to be in perfect shape ... to get that sort of a policy , i bet .
drop your shorts and bend over , mr. babar .
no , really .
we don' t need to .
we don' t want to do that .
my kidneys feel better in this position .
maybe i\ x9ds that i' m not doing any calisthenics .
if i did sit ups or bent over like this ...
i' d feel 100 % bet ...
# moon river ##
whew !
thank you , doc .
you ever serve time ?
breathe easy .
breathe easy .
i was surprised alan got that policy .
there' s a history of cancer in the family .
there is ?
yeah .
as a matter of fact ...
aah !
you using the whole fist ?
just relax .
i saw alan the other day .
he was looking peaked .
are you sure he' s all right ?
i can' t discuss another patient .
you know that .
well , i don' t find anything wrong with you .
i' m sure i\ x9ds not for a lack of looking .
12 noon .
i was anxious to return to my drug story .

i' m not finished .
sorry , mr. underhill .

i' il have a bloody mary ... a steak sandwich , and a steak sandwich .
so how' s alan ?
he' s been so busy lately , i hardly see him .
he' s been preoccupied .
with what ?
i don' t know .
personal stuff .
whoa !
i hit one .
lobs are important in tennis .
sorry , sir .
i' il show you a couple things .
stand here .
when the ball comes , face it like this .
yeah .
and then pivot your body , step in with your left foot .
just like this .
ok ?
go ahead .

all right .
go ahead .
get in position .
the ball' s going to come .
ready ?
how many are in the machine ?
a lot , i thought .
i\ x9ds finished .
good .
much better .
i must be having an off day .
i' m usually a fabulous player .
i affect women this way .
i bet you do .
i bumped into alan this morning .
you know what i can' t figure out ?
alan' s in utah .
i can' t figure out what i was doing in utah this morning .
i' m very flattered , but i' m also very married .
you' re hitting on me , aren' t you ?
how did you guess ?
i' m such a heel .
don' t know what came over me .
if i had a nickel for every one of alan' s flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up ...
i' d be rich .
you are rich .
see what i mean ?
the vice president knew i was opening the door ... but the secret service ...
whack !
and blood ...
washington .
sugar , mr. poon ?
no , never , never .
thank you .
well , now , let me reiterate ... that this is not a formal investigation .
if alan stanwyk isn' t involved in improprieties ...
alan stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties .
how can the s. e. c. make such an accusation ?
you know that , and i know that ... but somebody' s bucking for a promotion .
i\ x9ds probably that pederast hanrahan .
if i don' t go back with something ... you and your son in law will be the scapegoats .
unbelievable .
this is unbelievable .
they want to know why he' s in utah .
jesus h. christ on a popsicle stick .
first of all ...
alan stanwyk does not own one single share of stock .
the $3 million for the ranch in provo ... was entirely provided by my daughter ... who converted her personal , non corporate holdings .
so , if any of your d. c. boys ... want to challenge that , bring them on .
otherwise , tell them to get out of my face .
god , i admire you .
well ... consider this case closed .
it stopped bleeding .
isn' t that something ?
my pleasure .
thank you and good day .
by the way ... what kind of a name is poon ?
comanche indian .
good bye .
madeline , frieda lost the number for alan' s realtor in provo , utah .
could you get me that ?
jim swarthout ?
yeah .
who are you again ?
i' m frieda' s boss .
who' s frieda ?
my secretary .
i knew my junkie pals were awaiting my good cheer on the beach ... but i needed a second wind , a beer and a wardrobe change .
as i pulled up to my imitation apartment building ...
i observed the oldsmobuick of mr. arnold t. pants , esquire ... attorney for the former mrs. erwin fletcher .
time to use the service entrance .
refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense , fletch .
what about trespassing and loitering ?
i am neither loitering nor trespassing .
i' ve simply chosen an advisable location ... to await my clien\ x9ds delinquent husband .
i prefer to discuss business inside .
leave your rubbers outside .
a little one on one ?
he draws the foul .
you owe wendy $918 .
she doesn' t need it .
she' s been living with somebody for months .
i don' t what you' re referring to .
wendy maintains her own residence .
this stinks .
i empathize , fletch .
however , you threw her out .
she slept with everybody .
prove that in court .
my lawyer was a bum .
i agree .
they slept together .
you may be right .
are you serious ?
tha\ x9ds history , fletch .
you owe us $918 .
hey !
i think our problems may just be solved .
ed mcmahon .
i think i just won $1 million .
erwin m. fletcher , you choose .
whoo ee !
i lost .
sorry .
i\ x9ds no joke , fletch .
if some kind of payment isn' t made , i' il have to garnish your wages .
i can' t have my wages garnish ied .
tell you what .
cash ?
i' m impressed .
i saw my pimp today .
open your raincoat .
come on .
just once .
i\ x9ds worth it .
tha\ x9ds $1, 000 .
apply some towards next month .
now scram .
till then .
keep 10 and get yourself a nice piece of ass .
our guest is the most valuable player ... of the national basketball association ... from the los angeles lakers ... the all time scoring champion of the n. b. a. , kareem abdul jabbar .
he' s coming off a game that was second to none in his brilliant career .
you must be proud .
definitely , chick .
it was a great effort .
but i had a lot of help , and we' re just glad to be here .
how about fletch ?
what can i say about fletch ?
he' s been fantastic .
he boxes out for us , gets the tough rebounds ... and does what we need to win .
i\ x9ds great working with him .
i don' t know where we' d be without him .
le\ x9ds look at the play .
he' s 6' 5 .
with the afro , 6' 9 .
good dribbler .
comes in deep .
his club is behind by one point .
fletch puts the ball through the legs .
what a great play !
he puts it in !
the lakers have the lead !
was that some play !
this kid from harlem really creates excitement . $4 million a year , but he earns every nickel .
look how he shakes off four or five defenders with ease .
fletch ... he truly defines grace under pressure .
see if you' ve got anything on stanwyk from when he lived in utah .
yeah .
and check out a realtor in provo named swarthout .
shit !
wha\ x9ds going on ?
take off , fletch !
what are you doing ?
they' re after gummy again .
slow down .
this is dumb .
come on , man !
he' s defenseless .
don' t ...
get up !
what are you doing ?
fletch !
let me out !
beat it , cop !
hey , you' re really nuts .
you ok ?
yeah .
i feel like $100 .
they didn' t do anything .
what are you talking about ?
i busted their window .
you' re lucky .
i\ x9ds not luck .
they didn' t want me .
they wanted gummy .
the cops and gummy ...
relax , frank .
i need more time .
i could be onto something .
what ?
i don' t want to spoil your surprise .
read about it tomorrow .
what do you want ?
don' t point .
speak !
i need fletch .
she needs me .
nothing on utah or jim swarthout .
i know .
put this on the back burner .
right here .
tha\ x9ds good .
you wanna give me just a little hint ?
all right , frank .
there may be cops involved .
did you say cops ?
yeah .
tha\ x9ds one thing i found .
i\ x9ds from last month .
wha\ x9ds this ?
more cops .
frank , i need to go to utah .
utah ?
yeah , utah .
i\ x9ds wedged in between wyoming and nevada .
what about finding the source ?
i have some ideas .
say yes , frank .
i' il buy you some new deodorant .
go to transportation .
get a ticket .
my hero .
nothing to it .
you' re not recording this , are you ?
no .
never .
never .
question .
question .
why does a man ask me to kill him ... and lie about dying when he isn' t dying ?
gail stanwyk converts $3 million of her stocks ... to buy the ranch .
why pay in cash ?
mr. jim swarthout ?
i' m lgor stravinsky .
i' m calling about some ranch property i' d like to buy .
what did you have in mind ?
mm hmm .
are you a friend of alan' s ?
no , not exactly .
i overheard some people talking at the club . $3 million sounded like a good price .
oh , is that right ?
in that case , i have been very misinformed .
excuse you ?
yes .
i' d like to come out and see you anyway .
is that all right ?
wha\ x9ds good for you ?
well , i' m about to close up shop .
how about tomorrow morning ?
first thing in the morning .

why are you doing this ?
i like men .
i like to be manhandled .
i like you .
for someone caught holding a bag of heroin ...
that was planted .
we' re looking at maybe 10 years .
is that what you want , jane doe ?
your editor phoned me ... to respond to allegations you' re about to print ... concerning police involvement in narcotics dealings .
uh uh .
i' m about to bust that beach wide open .
i don' t need some penny ante woodward and bernstein ... to get in the way of my men .
your men may be involved in this .
i would think that might interest you .
idiot !
all right .
strictly off the record , ok ?
yeah , ok .
i got that beach crawling with undercover cops .
but if you go nosing around , you' il make the bad guys more cautious .
makes my job harder .
and listen , if you print your story this week ... it might get some of my men killed .
i can' t have that , mr. fletch .
you understand ?
yeah .
i understand .
i got a deadline .
the name' s karlin with a k ?
you dipshit !
go back to that beach , you won' t live to regret it !

# swing low , sweet chariot #

maybe i won' t keep you .
maybe i' il blow your brains out .
i do believe tha\ x9ds a violation of my rights .
after i shoot you , i stick myself with this knife ... and place it in your dead hand .
self defense .
we don' t do it anymore , but back in the old days ...
you' re serious .
ask anybody .
can i ask anybody now ?
can i call my mom , tell her i love her .
uh ... guess not .
i' m a newspaper reporter .
you don' t blow away newspaper reporters .
kinda stupid , isn' t it ?
what will it be , fletch ?
hey , i hate the beach anyway .
i\ x9ds not even my story .
i' ve got a deadline on the off track betting ... in the himalayas .
smaller story , but i know you' ve been following it .
you have things under control down there .

thank you .
how could you call him ?
fletch , i' m sorry .

yeah , i\ x9ds awful .

he threatened to kill me .
hey , tha\ x9ds a shame .

the dorf dorfman !
who is he ?
fred was darn near death recently .
he wasn' t ashamed to admit to me that he had syphilis .
thank god he stopped it in its tracks .
it takes a lot for a man ... to admit where he got it from and how he got it .
look at him today .
fred , you look just wonderful .
the nose looks normal again .
the face has come back into shape .
i\ x9ds not drooling anymore .
and hats off to marge , his wife , because that whole experience ... the three weeks that she stayed at trembling hills has paid off .
no more alcohol or sedatives in her life .
there are many other things i wanna tell you about fred ... things that maybe many of you already know .
sammy , you' re not going to sing for us , are you ?
did you know that fred spent much of his life ... honoring a profession that has gone largely unsung around here ?
some of them are here tonight .
the profession is law enforcement .
i know fred feels that too often our feelings are locked in ... and we feel restrained and perhaps even embarrassed ... to reach out and touch an officer of the law .
after all , they are people , aren' t they ?
stand up .
pat them on the back .
reach out .
shake hands with any one of these men in blue .
hug a cop !
yeah , go ahead .
i said it .
yeah !
tha\ x9ds a wonderful feeling !
i' m so proud tonight !

alan stanwyk murdered me tonight .
charred remains found in the jaguar are mine , not his .
mr. stanwyk , using my name and passport ... boarded pan am flight 306 .
on arrival , he intends ...
pretty hefty .
keep reading . ... with his legal wife ... the former sally ann cavanaugh ...
don' t stop , alan .
uh oh .
the missus .
what are you doing here ?
i know most of it .
i want to hear the rest from you .
he doesn' t read my stuff very well .
let me take a crack at it .
sally ann and alan were married eight years ago ... never divorced , making stanwyk a bigamist , even in utah .
stanwyk is traveling with $3 million in cash ... the result of gail stanwyk' s conversion of boyd aviation stock .
i\ x9ds true , isn' t it ?
sally ann can confirm this ... when the police pick her up at the airport marriott .
isn' t that where she is ?
by the way , alan is a big drug smuggler .
but you can read about that in tomorrow' s paper .
sincerely , i. m. fletcher .
p. s. have a nice day .
bravo , mr. fletcher .
bravo .
what tipped me was something your wife said while we were in bed together .
oh ?
and what was that ?
she said we had roughly the same build .
from the waist up , i imagine .
then i figured it .
you bump me off , plop me in the car ... and burn me up .
what the heck , same bone structure .
you son of a bitch .
but i' m not a stupid son of a bitch .
i was prepared to commit one murder , assface .
what makes you think i won' t commit two ?
whoops .
what do you mean , whoops ?
by the time your story' s published , i' il be on the beach .
i understand extradition from south america' s complicated .
for two murders , i\ x9ds even more so .
that thing loaded ?
if you shoot me ... you' re liable to lose those humanitarian awards .
tough shit , hopalong .
greetings , everyone .
thank god , the police .
what are you doing here ?
put the gun down .
i can take care of them .
thought you had this figured out .
nice going , erwin .
don' t ever call me erwin .
fat sam and gummy left the beach today .
it occurred to me that maybe there are things happening i should be aware of .
i' il take care of this .
it doesn' t involve you .
go home .
i' il call you tomorrow .
what ?
long distance ?
overheard you say something about south american extradition .
are you taking that $800, 000 i staked you with on the next load ?
you two have a lot to talk over .
we' il just catch the last ten minutes of dynasty .
jerry , you' re gonna have to trust me !
i got a way to get rid of this asshole , and you' re jeopardizing everything !
your way is gonna land my butt on the front page ... while you' re basking in the sun !

not necessarily .
not necessarily ?
larry !
in the court ruling u. s. vs. fishbein ... a man subjected to potential incineration ... while wearing another man' s suit ... is entitled to $10, 000 worth of airline tickets .
i\ x9ds an obscure ruling but very important one to me .
why don' t you say that you want to take me to rio with you ?
there' s a different slant .
the thing is , we haven' t really dated formally .
i take first dates to laker games .
i don' t want to go to a laker game .
i don' t like basketball .
maybe tha\ x9ds because you don' t understand basketball .
you haven' t learned the fundamentals .
the pick and roll .
sounds like a fast food chain .
reverse stuff .
that i' ve done .
i' il bet you have , you little vixen .
the coroner had certified stanwyk dead ... or extremely sleepy .
and chief karlin was facing 20 years in the fun house .
i decided to accompany gail to rio ... and personally assist her in her grief therapy .
on the beach , i explained basketball to her , but she didn' t grasp it .
fletch ?
call me erwin .
why do they bounce the ball the whole time ?
doesn' t it seem a little childish ?
well , it may seem that , but tha\ x9ds called dribbling .
dribbling ?
if they stop bouncing the ball ... they get called for traveling .
traveling .
aha .
tha\ x9ds what they call it when you don' t bounce the ball .
when it came to basketball , gail was a loss .
but we had our own version of one on one ... and she thought i was the bravest man in the world , which i am .
by the way , i charged the vacation to mr. underhill' s american express card .
