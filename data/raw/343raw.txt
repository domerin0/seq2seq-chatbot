outside .
let' s go .

thank you .
thank you .
anything you ever need , just ask me .
you endangered your life and the us marshals protecting you .
what ?
you went to your old restaurant .
you went back to gennaro' s ?
johnny , are you stupid ?
it' s the osso buco .
i was fucking dying for a decent meal !
next time , you' re dead !
this only happens once .
get out .
that was our ride !
let' s go .
go .
you won' t see me again , but i' il know your every move .
use your heads , lie low and no one will hurt you .
lf you try to skip out on your testimony , i' il deliver you to the canelli family .
i promise .
i owe you big time .
i' m a stand up guy , you got it ?
you ever need anything , you let me know .
what' s your name ?
honey , he doesn' t want to be pen pals .
smile .
you' ve just been erased .
john , would you look at something ?
one is from our shop , the others are real .
what do you think ?
that' s the fake .
who the hell is that ?
lf i tell you , i' d have to kill you .
shut up and run this again .
with a little sleight of hand ... ... one very dead john doe trades places with one very live scumbag .
robert , sit down .
you know ... ... if god was as forgiving as wltsec ... ... hell would be one empty joint .
god doesn' t have our court system .
i understand you had a busy night .
some witnesses got careless .
i see .
i had to defuse the situation .
did that include breaking into the county morgue ?
someone taught me that improvisation is the heart of field work .
it was you .
ln the old days .
weather' s changed .
now every asshole in congress is down our backs .
i' m telling you to walk softly .
ls that why beller called me in ?
because of the morgue ?
no , no , no .
he doesn' t know anything about that .
i don' t think he has to .
shadow ops still has some privileges .
you' re right .
john ... ... good work .
i had a good teacher .
bullshit .
you had the best .
14, 640 some odd people under wltsec protection ... ... and not one with a profile like this .
that bad ?
that good .
this young lady , miss cullen ... ... is a real live , bona fide ... ... honest person .
then why does she need us ?
she' s a senior executive at cyrez corporation .
they' re major defense contractors .
top secret weapons research .
looks like someone inside cyrez is selling out uncle sam .
feds need her to prove their case .
lf they do ... ... she' il be the key witness in the hottest scandal since lran contra .
when does this go down ?
tomorrow .
the sting' s in place .
when it' s over , she' s all yours .
sealed file on relocate .
your eyes only .
as usual , only you and i will be privy to the exact location of your witness .
but , john ... ... there are some serious players in washington ... ... who could be badly burned .
so could she .
eelcome to cyrez corporation .
all visitors are required to stop at the security station on the right .
good morning , dave .
she' s in .
anything yet ?
not yet .
that' s right , lady .
we' re right here .
we' re on .
you hear me ?
we hear you .
i look okay ?
tell her she looks great .
not bad , miss cullen .
not bad for an amateur .
we' re right with you .
yeah .
then let' s do it .
good morning , miss cullen .
good morning .
station c ?
yes .
and how long today ?
ten minutes max .
okay .
you' re doing just fine , lee .
let' s hope we bought the right combination .
bingo !
shit !
it' s okay .
we lose transmission in the vault .
what now ?
now we wait .
she better move fast .
she' s only got five minutes till the shift change .
what' s taking so long ?
sweetheart , you' ve got two minutes left .
shouldn' t have used her .
shit !
she' s out of time .
welcome back , lee .
we' re with you .
miss cullen ... ... mr. donahue would like to see you .
ln a minute .
he said , " right now .
what' s going on ?
i think they made us .
check the directory .
where' s donahue' s office ?
twenty fifth floor .
i know .
twenty fifth floor .
get backup ready to roll .
this could go south .
what is it , william ?
that' s someone i trusted for five years .
someone i told others could be trusted .
i was pulling
don' t !
we' re way beyond bullshit here .
who are you working for ?
shit , we' re dead .
i should ask you that question .
i thought it was for the us government .
come on , lee .
what do you think we do here ?
this isn' t the red cross .
we make weapons , things that kill people .
lf the government won' t pay the price ... ... it' s my job to find someone who will .
treason is part of the corporate strategy ?
i asked who you were working for .
you didn' t tell me .
my god .
holy shit .
christ .
get her out of there .
what is this ?
a camera ?
i' m working for the fbl , william .
they heard everything you just said .
they' re watching us now .
and you think that makes you safe ?
you ... ... have no fucking idea !
how could you do this to me ?
i hope you understand , lee .
you leave me no choice .
wait a minute !
stop her !
stop !
hey !
go , go , go !
hard evidence .
it' s all yours , gentlemen .
we' ve handled these situations before .
you haven' t answered my question .
we told you there' d be risks .
you told me i' d have complete protection the entire time .
it didn' t go as smoothly as we anticipated .
that' s an understatement .
remember , miss cullen , you came to us .
i came to you with a clerical error .
you asked for my help .
and we got it .
lf cyrez is selling weapons ' technology , that' s high treason .
this disk and your testimony will put them and their co conspirators behind bars .
you' ve done a great service for your country .
now , it' s time to think about your safety .
this is us marshal john kruger , of the witness protection program .
he' il handle your personal security .
my protection ?
your new identity , relocation .
i' il take you through it step by step .
what are you talking about ?
i' m not going anywhere .
you' re in an extremely high risk situation .
that should have been explained to you .
your boss was just a middleman , lee .
there are more dangerous people involved .
you expect me to give up my whole life ?
until the trial .
then you' il be completely out of danger .
and how do you know that ?
how do you know ?
look , i will keep up my end of the bargain .
i will testify .
but that' s it .
i' m going home .
put people on her right away ... ... or we' il need a seance for her testimony .
who brought her into this ?
she volunteered .
she had security clearance
you told her it' s a walk in the park .
when she finds out her life isn' t her own anymore , it' s too late .
we had no case without her .
it' s easier to put her ass on the line than yours , isn' t it ?
sully .
frediano , how' re you doing ?
good .
i have something for you .
let' s see .
your receipt .
gentlemen , always a pleasure .
it' s me .
your music has arrived .
get mr. morehart down here .
it' s me .
lee ?
i heard about donahue .
are you okay ?
i' m fine .
i shouldn' t have trusted them .
of course not .
the feds are idiots .
they' il blow the case or bury it .
the feds are here .
they' re watching me .
let me write this story and i' il nail cyrez all over the front page .
it may not be safe to talk on this phone .
i' il call you later . eait .
did you make a copy ?
yeah .
that' s your insurance , lee .
go public .
they won' t dare touch you .
lee , what' s wrong ?
i don' t know .
i got to go .
hi , baby .
what are you doing here ?
waiting for you .
how are you doing ?
so you just let yourself into my house ?
i' ve been worried about you .
i haven' t heard from you in days .
there' s nothing to talk about .
it' s over .
you know that .
come on .
that doesn' t hurt you to say that ?
it hurt me three months ago .
but after the phone calls , after the notes on my car , and tonight ... ... it' s getting a lot easier .
get down .
who' re you seeing ?
come on , darryl .
i know you' re seeing someone .
let' s see who that is .
what' s this ?
and a card .
get down !
oh , shit !
go , go , go !
come here !
stay down .
i don' t have a shot .
you , go , go .
what are you doing ?
lighting a fuse .
are you hit ?
what ?
are you hurt , are you bleeding ?
i don' t think so .
are they following us ?
no .
just calm down .
you' il be fine .
i' m not fine .
they tried to kill me !
darryl' s dead .
you' re alive .
and i' il keep you that way .
your hand .
there' s a first aid kit under your seat .
that weapon , or whatever it was ... ... was from your company , wasn' t it ?
it' s an e. m. prototype .
it' s not supposed to exist .
e. m. ?
electromagnetic pulse .
no gunpowder , no conventional bullets .
they fire aluminum rounds at almost the speed of light .
a rail gun .
yeah , that' s another name for them .
the navy' s been working on them for years .
the smallest one i' ve heard of is mounted on a battleship .
cyrez was contracted to scale them down ... ... to design a compact , hypervelocity pulse weapon .
the most powerful assault rifle on earth .
they took millions , then said it was impossible .
they looked real enough to me .
maybe cyrez found a higher bidder .
defense , cla , nsa ... ... maybe even your people .
still want to put them away ?
yes .
i' il hide you until the hearings .
no one will know where .
not my boss , not wltsec .
no one .
can you do that ?
the feds knew it' d be a death sentence for you , and let you walk right into it .
i was stupid .
you trusted them , that' s all .
now , trust me .
this is morehart .
we have a problem .
go ahead .
this line' s secure .
the cullen woman is still alive .
are you serious ?
it gets worse .
she has a disk .
she tried to access our program with it .
do you have any idea the risk i took to get this back ?
i know .
she must have made a duplicate .
then get it .
whatever it takes !
understood .
one other thing .
i checked her phone records .
and ?
she called a woman named lsaacs .
a reporter for the eashington herald .
i see .
you know what has to be done .
do it .
the joint chiefs are ready , mr. undersecretary .
i' il be right there .
thank you .
that' s it .
that' s everything i am .
that' s nothing .
it' s a few numbers and some plastic .
what you are is in here .
no one can take that from you .
they' il try .
we' il stop them .
i need the rest .
that' s all .
no .
this .
this ?
it' s st. george .
it' s silly , but when i was a kid i used to have nightmares about dragons .
he watched over you .
yeah .
well , that' s my job now .
get some sleep .
we' il leave at dawn .
okay .
' night .
there' s a place i know , where it' s easy to disappear .
there' s a woman there i helped .
she testified against the yakuza bosses in san francisco .
her new name is mei ling .
you' il be safe with her until the hearings .
your new name is deborah elliott .
you think of me as a " deborah ?
i don' t know .
i could have used something more fun , like ... ... " debbie ?
deb ?
deborah' s fine .
aaa credit .
what' s my limit ?
it is not a license to shop .
i want you to lay low right now .
mei ling will take good care of you .
you know the signal .
91 1 .
i get out of the apartment .
go straight to the pay phone and wait for my call .
it' s a public place , with six exits and six ways out .
and ... ... l work alone .
lf anyone comes to you and claims i sent them ... ... use this .
you just pull the trigger .
i guess i won' t see you again .
lf everything goes well ... no .
at least not until the trial .
thanks .
thank me when it' s over .
undersecretary of defense , daniel harper ... ... spoke before congress today about the cyrez scandal .
the use of private contractors is within the parameters ... ... of defense department spending .
i look forward to the cyrez hearing .
i' m confident ... ... we' il be vindicated of any mismanagement of funds .
thank you , mr. chairman , for the opportunity .
thanks for coming .
you know i don' t like meeting outside our normal channels .
it' s not my choice .
are they with you ?
yeah .
whether i like it or not ....
listen , john ... ... we' ve got a problem .
what' s going on ?
someone' s murdering our witnesses .
we' ve got three confirmed kills in the last 48 hours .
who ?
not one of yours .
not one of mine .
not yet .
did they break cover ?
no .
no , that is the problem .
and there' s no way anyone could know all three of their locations .
there' s a mole inside wltsec .
beller thinks so .
he may be right .
all three singers were witnesses in some high profile federal cases .
all with international ties .
that' s our common thread .
other singers fit the profile .
six .
one' s yours and one' s mine .
so ... ... we have to replant them immediately .
the jet is fueling as we speak .
i work alone .
you know that .
not today .
beller' s orders .
buddy system , cla escorts ... ... three teams .
we' re one of them .
fine .
we do yours first .
this is john kruger .
these are agents schiff and calderon .
i forgot which is which .
i' m schiff .
and i' m calderon .
know her ?
should l ?
she was doing a piece on cyrez .
there could be a connection to your witness .
did someone take her out ?
peeled her like an onion .
lf she knew anything , she talked .
this here is deputy monroe .
he' s one of ours .
mr. john kruger .
deputy .
sir , it' s a pleasure .
nice rig .
how many of these you got ?
three .
different parts of the country .
handy for quick relocates .
sometimes we run violent felons for the feds .
chauffeurs for degenerates .
don' t you get tired of babysitting scum ?
yeah .
but in your case , we' il make an exception .
who the hell does he think he is ?
he thinks he' s the best guy in the game .
i think he' s right .
try not to piss him off .
you' re east .
you' re west .
you' re north .
here .
we' ve got the boathouse , garage , back door .
we take the front entrance ?
you and me , buddy .
i don' t want to get shot today .

her name is allison .
she' s a very nice lady .
let' s bring her out safely .
here you go .
let' s go , big guy .
the engine' s still warm .

we must live contact her .

you' il like this better .
are you all right ?
i think so , sir .
first time under fire ?
it' s okay to be shaky .
hell , i' m shaky .
the thing is , sir ... ... l don' t know what i feel .
it was terrible and ....
exciting at the same time ?
nothing to be ashamed of .
it' s perfectly natural .
tell him .
it' s natural .
the whole game' s that way .
it' s like a drug .
you get hooked , there' s no turning back .
take me .
my old man ... ... a little nobody in d. c.
nice , quiet guy .
anyway , on his deathbed ... ... he tells me that all those years he was working for the cla .
i had to be part of that world .
i joined the cla , couple of years ... now i' m at wltsec .
hey , buddy .
what about you , sir ?
why did you join wltsec ?
sir , is something wrong ?
answer the kid .

ls it just the money ?
trying to start your own dirty , little war somewhere ?
wars ?
wars , john ?
wars come and go .
we did nam , we lost .
we did the gulf , we won .
what changed ?
nothing .
nothing ever does .
the only difference is who gets rich and who gets dead .
personally , john , i prefer rich .
you must be a very rich man by now .
it doesn' t have to end like this .
i can make you part of it .
a big part .
just give up the girl .
what do you say ?
drop your gun .
what ?
lf you drop your gun now ... ... l promise i won' t kill you .
i' il have to take my chances .
you nailed me with this cheap piece of mail order shit !
think about it !
you jump , you' il go through there like shit through a goose !
you' re right !

his prints were on the weapon .
you' ve run prints on him already ?
that' s moving fast .
i was there .
i saw it .
why would he do a thing like this ?
look ... ... the man has nothing to keep him honest .
he' s been bought .
i' ve known john for years .
we' re losing time .
lf he' s innocent , why' s he on the run ?
and his witness ?
she' s in it with him .

deguerin has been bought .
my witness knows too much .
federal agents say you are the shooter .
i' il call you back . ehen ?
when i have proof .
it' s gone too far .
we' re on our own .
what can we do ?
we can' t stay on the run for long .
we need some hard evidence .
you kept a copy ?
i was supposed to give it to a friend of mine , a reporter .
she asked me  claire lsaacs ?
how did you know ?
she' s dead .
they killed her .
how could they have known ?
i didn' t tell anyone .
i know .
it' s not your fault .
they probably tapped her phone .
there are many ways ....
everything' s going to be all right .
i was just trying to cover myself .
i didn' t know who i could trust .
now , i' il get us both killed .
no .
this may be all that keeps us alive .
i don' t even know what' s on that .
we' il find out .
it' s completely hacker proof .
there' s no way to run it outside cyrez .
then we' il run it from the inside .
it' s like a fortress .
we can' t go back there .
they' d expect that .
i' d hate to disappoint them .
the streets are clear .
the police have returned to the safety of their donut shops .
this is father rodriguez .
pleasure .
i was not always father rodriguez .
i was born again , with a little help from our friend .
his colombian associates wanted to introduce him to god personally .
i' ve been given a second chance at life .
this time , i' m using it for god' s work .
anything else i can do ?
we need a car .
just for a day or two .

there' s no one else i can trust .
it' s raining men , hallelujah , it' s raining men

i need to talk to you right away .
i' ve got one question .
was it your idea to hook me up with the village people here ?

i' il meet you at his place .
do i look like i' ve got gas ?
gentlemen .
what' s going on ?
it will be contained in 24 hours .
not good enough .
we have problems .
they' re solvable .
we must cancel the shipment .
not an option .
what do we do with ten tons of assault weaponry that' s not supposed to exist ?
i am the eyes and ears of your world .
there' s too much heat .
you don' t get it .
the money has changed hands .
these are not the kind of people you cancel on .
get those guns out of the country tonight or you' re dead .
now ... ... how will you contain the situation ?
kruger has to show up at cyrez .
i' il be waiting .
why would he risk it ?
the disk is the only thing that' il clear him and the woman .

he' s a ghost .
lf he wants in , he' il get in .
where' s he got to go to run this disk ?
the central vault .
no other terminal can access it .
lf he wants to read the disk , there' s only one way in .
outstanding , gentlemen .
all we do is sit back and wait for mr. kruger to come to us .
where are you going ?
take it easy .
i' ve got a delivery for blevens , 14th floor .
