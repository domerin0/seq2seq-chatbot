oh !
mr waternoose !
there is nothing more toxic or deadly than a human child .
a single touch could kill you !
leave a door open and a child could walk right into this factory !
right into the monster world !
i won' t go in a kid' s room !
you can' t make me !
you' re going in there because we need this .
our city is counting on you to collect those children' s screams .
without scream , we have no power .

i need scarers who are confident , tenacious tough , intimidating .
i need scarers like ... like ...

well , i don' t think that date could have gone any worse .
if witnesses are to be believed there has been a child security breach for the first time in monster history .
we can neither confirm nor deny the presence of a human child here tonight .
well , a kid flew right over me and blasted a car with its laser vision !
i tried to run from it , but it picked me up with its mind powers and shook me like a doll !
it' s true !
i saw the whole thing !
it is my professional opinion that now is the time to ... panic !
oh oh .
oh , it' s coming !
it' s coming !
boo !
no , no , no , no , no !
come here , kid .
whee .
no , don' t touch those , you little ... !

you' re doing great .
ooh , the happy bear , he has no ...
she touched me !
sulley , the bear !

whoa !
what was that ?
i have no idea but it would be really great if it didn' t do it again .
shh , shh , shh .
shh ...
shh .
shh ...
ah !
how could i do this ?
how could i be so stupid ?
this could destroy the company .
the company ?
who cares about the company ? !
what about us ?
that thing is a killing machine !
la la la la la la
i bet it' s just waiting for us to fall asleep and then wham !
oh , we' re easy prey , my friend easy prey .
we' re sitting targets .
okay , look , i think
i have a plan here .
using mainly spoons , we dig a tunnel under the city and release it into the wild .
spoons .
that' s it , i' m out of ideas .
we' re closed .
hot air balloon ?
too expensive .
giant slingshot ?
too conspicuous .
enormous wooden horse ?
too greek !
no plan .
no plan .
can' t think .
can' t think .
flatlining .
uh , mike ?
i think she' s getting tired .
well , then why don' t you find someplace for it to sleep ?
while i think of a plan !
are you sleepy ?
you want to sleep ?
is that what you want ?
huh ?
okay , all right .
i' m making a nice little area for you to ...
no .
hey , hey , that' s my bed !
you' re going to get your germs all over it .
fine .
my chair is more comfortable anyway .
what ?
it' s just a closet .
will you go to sleep ?
hey , that looks like randall .
randall' s your monster .
you think he' s going to come through the closet and scare you .
oh , boy , how do i explain this ?
uh , it' s empty .
see ?
ah !
no monster in here .
well , now there is but i' m not going to scare you .
i' m off duty .
okay .
how about i sit here , until you fall asleep ?
go ahead .
go to sleep .
now .
now ... go .
uh , you ... go ... to ... sleep .
hey , mike , this might sound crazy but i don' t think that kid' s dangerous .
really ?
well , in that case , let' s keep it .
i always wanted a pet that could kill me !
now , look .
what if we just put her back in her door ?
what ?
mike , think about it .
if we send her back , it' s like it never happened .
everything goes back to normal .
is that a joke ?
tell me you' re joking .
sulley , i' d like to think that , given the circumstances
i have been extremely forgiving up to now but that is a horrible idea !
what are we going to do ?
march right out into public with that thing ?
then i guess we just waltz right up to the factory , right ?
i can' t believe we are waltzing right up to the factory .
sulley , a mop , a couple of lights and some chair fabric are not going to fool anyone !
just think about a few names , will you ?
loch ness , bigfoot , the abominable snowman they all got one thing in common , pal banishment .
we could be next !
don' t panic we can do this .
hey , how you doing , frank ?
hey , guys .
everything' s going to be okay .
number one wants this place dusted for prints .
careful with that .
i got a good view from here .
a little lower .
this was recovered at the scene .
don' t panic .
don' t panic !
don' t tell me not to panic .
just keep it together .
everything is not okay !
boo . ... could be contaminated .
gentlemen , safety is our number one concern .
if there' s anything that ...
not now , not now .
oh , hello , little one .
where did you come from ?
mr waternoose !
ah , james !
is this one yours ?
actually , that' s my , uh , cousin' s sister' s daughter , sir .
yeah , it' s , uh ...

hmm , must have missed the memo .
well , listen , james why don' t you stop by the simulator after lunch today and give us that scare demonstration we talked about , huh ?
oh , oh , sir , uh ....
excuse me , mr waternoose ?
yes , yes , i' m coming .

how could this happen ?
oh , how could this happen ?
does anyone else know about this ?

this company can' t afford any more bad publicity .
now , before we do anything else , let' s ... take care of the child .
oh , i never thought things would come to this ... not in my factory .
i' m sorry you boys got mixed up in this .

wore it on his head like a tiara .
called himself king itchy .
ah , it won' t be so hard for you guys , though , you know .
i mean , how lucky can you get ?
banished with your best friend .
