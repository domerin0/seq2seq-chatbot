hey , guys hey
honey , i got us that room at the woodford inn this weekend .
that place in vermont ?
you can take a hint !
wait , you can' t go away this weekend .
it' s emma' s birthday .
yeah !
we' re having a party .
can' t you just have the party when we get back ?
no , that' s silly .
that won' t be her real birthday .
gee , if only she were one and had no idea what the hell the birthday was .
come on , you guys .
this is really important to us .
oh , i' m sorry but chandler and i could really use a weekend away .
you know , to reconnect ..... emotionally .
there' s this thing i really want us to do .
i read about it in maxim .
what ?
can' t you just go to vermont the next day ?
yeah , we want everyone to be there
as much as i hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister .
and i mean , you know , you guys , this is a big deal .
i mean , how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle ?
alright , we' il stay .
we can just drive up after the party .
fine but if we end up not doing this maxim thing because of this party ...
believe me that is not why we won' t be doing that .
friends 10x04 tow the cake
you know pheebs .
when i was little , on my birthday , my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house , and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find them all .
oh ... i love family traditions like that .
when , uh , when ursula and i were kids , on our birthday , our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food .
hey you guys hi
hey i brought the camera for emma' s video .
oh , good , good !
we have this idea to make a birthday video for emma and we' il give it to her when she' s 18 .
oh , cool !
wow !
it' s like a time capsule .
yeah
oh , just think !
she' s gonna be watching that video on a tv that hasn' t even been invented yet .
with friends who right now are just like babies
and they' il be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people .
that' s the hope !
so is , uh , emma awake yet ?
oh no , it' s still nap time but she' il be up soon .
ah , where' s joey ?
i said it' s still nap time .
hey , there' s uncle joey .
hey
hey , say something to emma on her 18th birthday .
18 , huh ?
joey , no !
what ?
what ?
it' s for her hot friends .
when they see this , you' il be fifty two .
and starting to think about settling down !
hey joey , will you please set this up for people to put emma' s presents on .
love to .
yeah .
we were supposed to bring presents ?
yeah .
i wrote emma a song .
oh , yeah .
how was i supposed to know ?
joey , it' s a birthday party .
yeah but for a one year old .
what' s the point ?
the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup .
just , just a cup with a picture of elmo on it dressed as a farmer .
and he' s standing next this cow .
the cow says " elmoooo
man ..
that' s a funny cup .
hey hey
where' s the birthday girl ?
oh , she' s still napping .
oh , sure .
she was probably up all night excited about the party she knows is happening .
look , i know that you guys really want to get to vermont and this isn' t a really big deal to you .
but it really is to us .
okay ?
emma will never have her first birthday again .
alright .
you' re right .
we' re sorry .
now let' s wake up emma and get the fun time started !
no , really she didn' t sleep well last night so we can' t wake her up .
are you friggin ' kidding me , green ?
hi hey
glad you came .
i can' t believe emma' s already one !
i remember your first birthday .
ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you .
he pulled on his testicles so hard we had to take him to the emergency room .
there' s something you didn' t know about your dad .
hey , hey , mr. and mrs. geller .
let me help you with that .
thank you .
oh , man .
this is great , huh ?
three of us together again ?
you know what would be fun ?
if we gave this present to emma from all of us ...
which one are you ?
i can' t believe emma' s still asleep .
i know !
what are we going to do ?
i' ve got a plan .
i' ve got a plan .
i' m going to ram this platter really hard onto your ribs .
you' re going to scream out and that will wake her up .
i' m not going to vermont with this monica .
hey , pheebs .
you know what ?
i was thinking since you wrote a song maybe i could do somthing for emma using my talents .
so you' re gonna ... hit on her ?
no , no , no .
my talents as an actor .
you know , i could , like , maybe ...
i could do a dramatic reading of one of her books .
or you could stick a fork in an apple !
hey , i think emma might like it .
oh , emma might like what ?
um ... my present .
oh , what did you get her ?
actually we prepared performances .
well , separate performances .
but equally real .
oh , that sounds like fun !
well , you know what ?
actually ...
people are getting a little antsy waiting for emma to wake up from her nap .
so would you mind performing them once now ?
sure , yeah yeah ?
o .... kay okay ?
everybody , let' s get this party started , huh ?
joey and phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us .
oh , great !
aren' t you gonna be embarrassed going up there ? having nothing prepared ?
hey , i do it every week with 3 cameras pointing at me and the whole crew waiting .
so joey , what are you gonna do for us ?
uh ... i will be doing a dramatic reading of one of emma' s books .
oh .
okay .
which one ?
oh , well , it' s , uh ...
one of her favorites .
riding the storm out : coping with postpartum depression .
yeeesh !
love you forever .
love you forever by robert munch . published by firefly books .
printed ... in mexico .
a mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth
back and forth .
back and forth .
and while she held him , she sang " i' il love you forever
i' il like you for always as long as i' m living my baby you' il be .
and while he rocked her , he sang
i' il love you forever .
i' il like you for always .
as long as i' m living , my baby you' il be .
wow !
that was amazing .
thank you so much for that gift .
i was not ready for this today .
amazing , amazing .
oh , phoebe .
i' m sorry .
phoebe has prepared something as well .
that' s right .
i prepared a song for emma .
from my heart to hers .
for there' s no greater gift than the gift of music .
emma !
your name poses a dilemma
cause not much else rhymes with emma
maybe the actor richard crenna
he played the commanding officer in rambo
happy birthday , emma
is that it ?
no , of course not .
no , no , i' ve also , you know , prepared a reading .
sex and the single mother .
finding your g spot .
no !
hello emma .
happy 18th birthday .
right now that seems so far away .
seventeen years .
yes .
you' il be all grown up by then and we' il be ...
well , your grandfather and i might not be here .
that' s true .
this message could be coming to you from beyond the grave , emma .
after all , my parents died very young .
and my cholesterol' s off the charts !
remember , emma .
heart disease kills women , too .
okay , cut !
great , great .
that was , that was just ... yeah .
ross , um , don' t forget to get a shot of emma' s cake .
it' s in a box in the fridge .
okay , sure .
oh , you' re gonna love this cake .
i got it from a bakery in new jersey , carino' s .
oh my god .
that place has the creamiest frosting .
i used to hitchhike there when i was a kid .
well , anyway .
they make these great novelty cakes in all different shapes and if you give them a photo they' il copy it in icinig .
oh , did you do a picture of emma ?
yes , on a cake shaped like a bunny .
oh , rach .
does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes ?
say , for bachelorette parties ?
ross , what are you talking ...
oh , my god !
they put my baby' s face on a penis !
oh , now it' s a party !
you guys , this isn' t funny .
alright ?
if i wanted this cake to be a disaster , i would' ve baked it myself !
uh .... is it okay that i still think it looks delicious ?
jack , look at this .
i know what you' re thinking , judy .
the resemblance is uncanny .
i am this close to tugging on my testicles again .
no , no , this is not what i ordered .
okay ?
i went all the way to new jersey so that i could have the perfect cake for my daughter' s birthday and i need a bunny cake right now !
ask him if it will be faster if we cut the baby' s face off the penis so we could put it on the bunny .
that is a weird sentence .
oh , believe you me ,
i am going to bring this cake back .
i don' t even want it in my home .
joey , don' t touch it !
i' m so confused !
yes , yes , i still want my daughter' s picture but on a bunny cake
yellow cake , chocolate frosting with nuts !
to be fair , this one does have nuts .
hey , mon .
it was really nice of you to loan rachel your car so she could go get the cake .
it was so nice of her to pull my hair till i dropped the key .
well , you know , while we' re waiting , you guys could tape your message to emma for her 18th birthday , huh ?
okay .
hi emma .
it' s the year 2020 .
are you still enjoying your nap ?
we' re aunt monica and uncle chandler by the way .
you may not recognize us because we haven' t spoken to your parents since 17 years !
we used to be married but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled because of you .
happy birthday .
ross , rachel promised it would be over by now .
we seriously have to go if we want to get to vermont .
i called them .
the last train leaves in a half hour .
and you know , i have a massage client soon .
you guys , just please .
a little bit longer
i promise rachel will be back with the cake any minute .
monica , rememeber the frosting ?
huh ?
alright , five more minutes .
hello .
oh no , what happened ?
what ?
okay .
okay .
where are you ?
okay , i' il be right there .
was that emma ?
is she up ?
rachel got pulled over for speeding .
she forgot her license so now i have to bring it to her .
well , if you' re leaving i' m definitely gonna go .
wait !
if anybody gets to go , it' s us .
we' ve been complaining the longest .
wait , you guys .
no , no .
you can' t leave .
rachel already feels bad that the cake' s messed up .
how do you think she' s gonna feel when she comes back here and all of you guys are gone ?
i don' t know .
you' il tell us on monday .
joey , you' re in charge , okay ?
you make sure nobody leave .
got it !
hey , hey , hey .
where do you think you' re going ?
to the bathroom .
alright , well , the rest of you get comfortable , okay ?
because we' re gonna be here for a .....
wait a minute .
there' s a window in there .
oh , no !
he' s not getting away that easy .
what are you doing ?
get the hell out of here !
that one did not have emma' s face on it .
um , no , it did not .
well , we' d better get going .
it' s late .
jack' s not allowed to drive at night anymore .
he has trouble staying in his lane .
last winter i went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger scene .
the papers thought that it was a hate crime .
anyway , it was lovely seeing you .
okay bye .
bye dear .
nighty night nighty night
joey , how could you just let them leave ?
hey , hey , hey .
i' m not gonna mess with jack .
he' s a great man .
he fought for our country .
no , he didn' t .
he pretended to be a quaker to get out of korea .
huh !
well , that' s it .
he' s the last one to go .
i' m locking you guys in .
you do know i can just turn them the other way around .
right ?
oh , forgot you used to live here .
hello .
joey , it' s estelle .
hey .
so how did your audition go today ?
what audition ?
the one i told you about last week .
what ?
you never said anything about an audition .
let me start over .
i just got a call about an audition .
i think you can still make it .
it' s down at the aster theater and you need to have a monologue prepared .
a monologue ?
i don' t have a ....
i got it .
uh , so , i' m gonna take off .
what ?
no way !
you don' t get to leave .
i' ve got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute .
yeah , and we paid for a room that we' re supposed to be in right now .
well , okay , now .
only one of us has to stay with emma .
okay and as the person who realized that i get to go .
no , no, no , no , no .
let' s figure out a fair way to decide who' s staying .
oh !
i got it .
okay , everyone pick a number from one to ten , alright ?
whoever gets the highest number gets to go first .
okay , ten .
okay .
monica picks ten and i call nine .
anyone else ?
no , let' s just , let' s just draw straws .
or we could flip a coin and then multiply the ...
i' m beggin you to stop .
alright .
ok , how about this ?
we got wind up toys for emma for her birthday .
we can make them race and whoever comes in last stays .
yeah , let' s do that !
that sounds more fun than the thing we' re gonna do in vermont !
everybody , pick the toys !
okay .
i want the dolphin !
that' s a bear .
i' m too excited !
okay , phoebe , you get the bear .
joey , you get the robot .
and chandler and i get the dog .
okay ?
and the race is going to go from here to here .
now the one who comes in last .... stays !
okay , ladies and gentlemen , wind your toys .
on your mark , get set .... go !
go , go !
come on , robot !
what are you barking at ?
how is that going to help ?
i bought you !
how did i forget that that' s all you do ?
way to go , robot !
good job , alan !
hey , good race , you guys yes .
see you later .
no , no , no , wait .
we didn' t lose .
the rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser .
well , our dog never crossed the finish line so technically ....
they left .
no , there' s no time to go to bakery .
we' re just gonna come home .
everybody left ?
alright , well , just tell emma that we' il be there as soon as we can .
bye .
rachel !
no !
god , sorry .
i can' t believe they gave you a ticket .
you' re such a good driver .
emma' s awake .
yeah ?
i can' t believe this .
this is her first birthday .
she' s awake .
we' re not even there .
everybody left .
we still have the stupid obscene cake .
well , maybe i can fix that .
you know ?
try to , try to turn it into something else .
oh , don' t even bother .
i' ve already ruined her first birthday .
do you know how important these early experiences are , ross ?
very .
according to the back cover of that book you gave me .
rach , she' s not gonna remember this .
i guess .
oh , i just had such an idea what this day would be like .
you know ?
emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing happy birthday .
then we would all go into the ...
hey , get off the road , you stupid student driver !
they have to learn !
hey , this isn' t that bad .
oh my god !
look , you made it into a bunny !
how did you do that ?
well , i just made these two things , um, cheeks .
and then i split this to make ears .
wel ,, i' m very impressed .
some can sing .
some can dance .
i apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures
another way to organize your stuffed animals is by size .
i' m sorry .
is this a game for emma or for monica ?
game ?
emma , do you even know it' s your birthday today ?
you' re one .
one year old .
that' s little .
huh !
that' s my girl !
that' s how old you are .
did i teach her that ?
did i just impart wisdom ?
i want one .
me too .
there' s no one around .
why don' t we just take this one ?
and head to canada .
i was kidding .
i wasn' t !
let' s get going !
hey .
are ross and rachel back ?
no , not yet .
oh good !
i didn' t miss the party .
what about your massage client ?
i just felt so bad missing this so i just slipped him a little something .
you know , as long as i' m back in 5 or 6 hours , it will be alright .
okay , if ross and rachel ask , i' ve been here the whole time .
the whole time !
i' ve been here the whole time .
joey , we just saw you come in .
you ran past us on the stairs .
i don' t care that you left .
i' m just glad that you' re here .
