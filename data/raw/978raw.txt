this is not what we were led to expect .
we were to see the arno .
the signora wrote " south rooms with a view , close together " .
instead of which , we have north rooms without a view and far apart .
hurry and get dressed or we' il miss our dinner on top of everything else .
she had no business doing it .
no business at all !
any nook does for me , but it is hard that you have no view .
no , you must have a view , too .
buonasera .
buonasera .
miss lavish , what a recommendation for a place !
indeed , miss alan , it is .
between the squalor of london and the squalor of prato , there is a great gulf fixed .
by going off the track , you get to know the country , see the little towns , gubbio , settignano , galuzzo ,
san gimignano , monteriggioni .
their mixture of the primitive with the classical is irresistible .
miss pole ?
yes , mr. emerson .
what is that you are taking ?
it' s not lemonade , is it ?
yes , it is .
put it right away , miss pole .
lemonade is very bad for the stomach .
oh !
i shall tell the signora to give the next south view available to you .
why not to you ?
no , i insist .
this meat has surely been boiled .
for stock .
it' s lost all its flavor .
monteriggioni is not only quaint , but one meets the italians in all their simplicity and charm .
wasn' t monteriggioni where we saw the cornflowers , teresa ?
an entire carpet of them .
it was delightful !
i find the cornflower the most delightful of flowers .
i prefer something bolder the reckless rose , the tempestuous tulip .
your mother would never forgive me .
she' d want you to have it .
on no account .
the view of the arno is yours .
i don' t know why we' re arguing , because we have no view .
i have a view .
and so does george .
my son george here .
you can have our rooms .
we' il have yours .
we can change .
why not ?
thank you very much .
we could not impose on your kindness .
why ?
you see ...
hush , lucy .
women like looking at a view .
men don' t .
george , persuade them .
it' s obvious they should have the rooms .
signora ?
no , thank you .
we could clear out in fifteen minutes .
these niceties go against common sense !
every kind of sense .
i don' t care what i see outside .
my vision is within .
here is where the birds sing and where the sky is blue .
come , lucy .
let them have the view if they want it .
why not ?
george , go after them .
what an impossible person !
he meant to be kind .
i know how to deal with these people .
charlotte , you dealed rudely .
you dealed wrongly .
this pensione is a failure .
tomorrow we' il change .
it' s mr. beebe .
who ?
charlotte , we can' t change now .
mr. beebe .
don' t you remember us ?
miss bartlett and miss honeychurch .
we met at tunbridge wells .
that very cold easter .
how do you do ?
i heard you are to be our vicar .
yes , i move into the rectory in june .
we did feel so sorry for you in the dining room .
mr. emerson is so tactless .
but he meant to be kind .
this old gentleman and his son offered us their rooms with a view .
it was most indelicate !
but things that are indelicate can sometimes be beautiful .
yes !
i am the chaperone to my young cousin lucy .
it would be serious if i put her under an obligation to people of whom i know nothing .
i wouldn' t think much harm could have come .
there .
you think i ought to have accepted ?
you think i have been narrow minded .
i never suggested that .
if you would allow me , i would be happy to act as intermediary with mr. emerson .
he would not take advantage nor expect gratitude .
he has rooms he does not value and thinks you would .
charlotte , please .
my wishes are unimportant compared with yours .
i am only here through your kindness .
if you want me to turn these gentlemen out of their rooms , i will .
would you , mr. beebe , kindly tell mr ...
emerson .
emerson ... ... we accept his offer ?
i would like to thank your father personally for his kindness .
you can' t .
he' s in his bath .
i would have given the larger room to you , but i happen to know it was the young man' s .
in my small way , i am a woman of the world .
and i know where things can lead .
whatever does it mean ?
lucy , get dressed or the better part of the day will be gone .
you said you liked cornflowers .
so we brought you cornflowers .
oh , how kind !
they' re your type of flowers .
they have your personality .
i' d like to see them in your hair .
there are no jewels more becoming to a lady .
may i say something rather daring ?
mr. beebe , you sound like miss lavish .
are you writing a novel , too ?
if i were , you would be my heroine .
and i should write " if miss honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays ... " ... it will be very exciting , both for us and for her .
mother doesn' t like me playing beethoven .
she says i' m peevish afterwards .
naturally , one would be stirred up .
won' t you play some more ?
no , i think i' il go out .
alone ?
is that wise , miss honeychurch ?
to be wise , one might have stayed at home .
i' il not go far .
i promise .
i' m sorry .
whatever' s the matter with dear miss lucy ?
i put it down to too much beethoven .
i heard her beautiful playing .
miss catharine , you have flowers in your hair .
buongiorno , buongiorno , ferdinando !
we salute thee .
the bronze came from turkish cannons , captured by the knights of san stefano .
come along .
stop a minute .
let that man go on or i shall have to speak to him .
oh , the british abroad !
i' d set an examination at dover and turn back any tourists who failed .
miss , this sepolcro not very good .
you go see affresci di giotto .
capella peruzzi , capella bardivery good .
no , thank you .
giotto scolaro di cimabue .
kept the sheep on the mountain .
make a picture of the sheep .
no , thank you .
i very ... good speak english .
do go away , please .
capella peruzzi , affresci di giotto ...
cio tuttol
you see here these superb frescoes by giotto , depicting the life of st francis .
on the left , there he is , renouncing worldly goods .
and , on the right , the fourth pope .
and here he is preaching to the bishops .
and there he is undergoing a ... trial by fire before the sultan .
and here ...
ah , mr. eager , good morning .
i' m leading a little private tour of my own .
here he is on his deathbed , surrounded ...
mr. eager is our english chaplain here in florence . ... now unhappily ruined by restoration , is untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective ...
look at that fat man !
he must weigh as much as i do , but he' s floating like a balloon .
remember that santa croce was built by faith in the full fervor of medievalism .
built by faith !
that simply means the workers weren' t paid properly !
pardon me .
the chapel is somewhat small .
we will incommode you no longer .
oh , i ...
oh !
mr. eager , there' s plenty of room for all of us .
you don' t have to ...
oh , dear .
gather round , everybody .
you may observe here in the peruzzi chapel , as well as in the place from which we' ve been expelled , the special character of giotto among the great painters .
he was practical ...
my poor boy has brains , but he' s very muddled .
but why should he be ?
well may you ask .
but think how he' s been brought up free from the superstition that leads men to hate in the name of god .
i must go ...
i don' t require you to fall in love with my boy , but please help him .
if only one could stop him from brooding .
and on what ?
the things of the universe .
i don' t believe in this world sorrow .
do you ?
no , i don' t .
not at all , mr. emerson .
well , there you are .
make my boy realize that , at the side of the everlasting " why " , there is a " yes " .
and a " yes " and a " yes " !
has your son no particular hobby ?
i forget my worries at the piano , and collecting stamps helped my brother .
excuse me .
my cousin will be most anxious if i don' t get back .
poor girl .
poor girl ?
i think myself most fortunate .
i' m very happy and having a splendid time .
thank you very much .
goodbye .
look at that adorable wine cart .
how he stares at us , dear simple soul !
i love these little dark alleys .
they' re all peasants , you know .
come along .
i do declare we' re lost .
no , miss bartlett , you will not look into your baedeker .
two lone females in an unknown city , that' s what i call an adventure .
we will simply drift .
one always has to be wide open .
i think miss lucy is .
open to what , miss lavish ?
to physical sensation .
i' il let you into a secret .
i have my eye on your cousin .
for a character in your novel ?
the young english girl , transfigured by italy .
and why should she not be transfigured ?
it happened to the goths .
signorina ?
the smell !
a true florentine smell .
inhale , my dear .
deeper .
every city , let me tell you , has its own smell .
grazie .
how are you now ?
perfectly well .
absolutely well .
then , let' s go home .
there' s no point in our stopping .
how very kind you' ve been .
i can go alone .
thank you .
my photographs !
what photographs ?
i must have dropped them in the square .
would you be so kind ... ?
miss honeychurch !
you' re not fit enough to go alone .
i am .
no , you' re not !
but ...
then i don' t get the photographs .
besides , that way , you' d have to fly over the wall .
sit down and don' t move until i come back .
isn' t it extraordinary ?
i mean , italians are so kind , so lovable , and yet at the same time so violent .
mr. emerson ?
i' ve never been so ashamed .
i can' t think what came over me .
it' s perfectly natural .
i nearly fainted myself .
well , i owe you a thousand apologies .
and ...
i want to ask you a great favor .
you know how silly people are .
gossiping .
ladies especially , i' m afraid .
you understand what i mean ?
no .
i mean , would you not mention it to anyone , my foolish behavior .
what was that ?
i believe it was my photographs !
i didn' t know what to do with them .
they were covered with blood .
there .
now i' ve told you .
something tremendous has happened .
well , thank you ... again .
how quickly accidents happen .
then one returns to the old life .
i don' t .
i mean ... something' s happened to me .
and to you .
no !
she is my sister .
we ought not to allow this .
they' re doing no harm .
you can' t object in such a landscape .
as long as she is his sister .
so , miss honeychurch , you' re traveling .
as a student of art ?
no , i' m afraid not .
as a student of human nature like myself ?
i' m here as a tourist .
indeed ?
we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little .
handed about like parcels from venice to florence to rome , unconscious of anything outside baedeker , anxious to get done and go on elsewhere .
i abhor baedeker .
i' d fling every copy in the arno .
towns , rivers , palaces , all mixed up in an inextricable whirl .
over there , miss honeychurch , the villa of my dear friend lady laverstock , at present busy with a fra angelico definitive study .
and , on your left no , just there
mr. henry burridge lives .
an american of the best type .
so rare !
doubtless you know his monographs in " medieval byways " .
your father , mr. emerson , is a journalist ?
he used to be .
he' s retired ?
and you , yourself ?
i' m on the railways .
you know the american girl in " punch " who says to her father ,
say , poppa , what did we see in rome ?
the father replies , " guess rome was where we saw the yellow dog .
yellow dog !
there' s traveling for you !
what ? !
stop at once !
i' m not having this .
ferma la carrozza subitol
have we bolted ?
what ?
is phaethon misbehaving with his persephone ?
please , i' il deal with them .
leave them .
do we find happiness so often that we should turn it away ?
scendal
beauty !
espoirl
is that your son ?
could that be the silent , dour george ?
he' s saying his creed .
one more lump , if i might trouble you , mr. beebe .
joy !
beauty !
joy ... !
he' s declaring the eternal " yes " .
and a spoon , if there is one .
love !
what' s that ?
the gentlemen are doubtless having a game .
why don' t you join them , dear ?
i want to stop here with you .
observe my foresight .
i never venture forth without my mackintosh squares .
at any time , one may have to sit on damp ground or cold marble .
lucy , you have the other one .
come on , i insist .
the ground will do for me .
i have not had rheumatism for years , and if i feel a twinge i' il stand up .
and she never went back to weybridge ?
her friend had to return without her .
she remained at monteriano .
and did she really ... ?
no , no .
don' t be alarmed .
this is not a cold .
just a slight cough .
i' ve had it for three days .
nothing to do with sitting on the ground .
i shall go and find mr. beebe .
oh , do , dear .
he will be so pleased .
did she really marry this italian ?
in the church at monteriano .
a youth .
ten years younger than herself .
eleanor !
pucclni' s " chi il bel sogno di doretta " from " la rondlne " )
excuse me .
dove mr. beebe ?
buoni uomini ?
i think there is something in the italian landscape which inclines even the most stolid to romance .
it reminds me somewhat of the country around shropshire .
where i once spent a holiday at the home of my friend miss apesbury .
and i divine it , charlotte .
you had an adventure there .
vain to deny it .
lucy !
mr. eager , do come and join us .
miss honeychurch is feeling unwell .
andiamo .
andiamol
george .
george .
aren' t you coming with us ?
i' il walk .
are you sure ?
courage , miss honeychurch , and faith .
do you suppose this display is called into existence to extinguish you or me ?
even scientifically , the chances against being struck are enormous .
the steel knives that might attract the current are in the other carriage .
what is to be done ?
how do you propose to silence him ?
the driver ?
my dear girl , no .
mr. george emerson .
i don' t wish to be uncharitable , but i know he will talk .
he will not .
he never talks .
one' s lucky to get as much as a " yes " or " no " out of him .
unfortunately , i have met the type before .
they seldom keep their exploits to themselves .
exploits ?
very well .
i' il speak to him .
oh , no , my dear lucy .
i think it is for me to do that .
he should have been here at least an hour ago .
don' t stand there , dear .
you will be seen from the outside .
the moment he comes , i shall face him .
no , my dear , you will do no such thing .
my poor dear girl , you are so young !
you' ve always lived among such nice people .
you cannot realize what men can be .
this afternoon , if i had not arrived , what would have happened ?
i can' t think .
answer me , lucia .
what would have happened had i not appeared ?
you did appear !
oh , i have vexed you at every turn .
it' s true .
i am too old for you .
and too dull .
it will be a push to catch the morning train .
i have failed in my duty to your mother .
she will never forgive me when you tell her .
come away from the window !
she will certainly blame me when she hears of it .
certainly .
and deservedly .
why need mother hear of it ?
well , you tell her everything .
don' t you ?
i suppose i do , generally .
there' s such a beautiful confidence between you .
one would hate to break it .
and , as i' ve said before , i am to blame .
but , of course , we have not had a full week .
i reserved them for a week like you wrote you wanted .
yes , but we' ve only had half a week , so i calculate we owe you half the price .
i' m the loser .
i could have let them rooms five times over .
buonasera .
grazie .
lucy !
we must get packed immediately !
i wish to have a word with you , mr. emerson , in the drawing room , please .
you shouldn' t peep .
cecil asked my permission , but he can' t manage without me .
nor me .
you ?
he asked my permission also .
whatever did you say ?
i said no .
what ? !
it' s the way he put it wouldn' t it be a splendid thing for lucy if he married her ?
wasn' t i off my head with joy ?
so i said no , i wasn' t .
ridiculous child .
you think you' re so holy and truthful , but it' s just conceit .
look out !
i promessi sposel
she has accepted me .
i' m so glad .
dear cecil , what joy !
well , welcome as one of the family .
thank you .
mother ?
lucy .
freddy !
mr. beebe .
thank you , mary .
hello , mr. vyse , i' ve come for tea .
do you suppose i shall get it ?
food is the one thing one does get here .
what an extraordinary thing !
one of freddy' s bones .
he' s terrible .
a most unpromising youth .
so unlike his sister .
you think his sister is promising ?
i have a pet theory about miss honeychurch .
is it not odd that she should play beethoven with such passion and live so quietly ?
i suspect that one day ... ... music and life will mingle .
then she will be wonderful in both .
i trust that day is at hand .
she has just promised to marry me .
i' m sorry if i' ve given you a shock .
i' m awfully sorry .
i' d no idea you were so intimate with her .
you should have stopped me .
shall we join the others ?
congratulations .
blessings .
your vicar' s benediction .
i want you to be supremely happy .
and supremely good , both as man and wife , mother and father .
and now i want my tea .
just in time .
how dare you be so serious !
summer street will never be the same .
it' s too small for anyone like ourselves .
it might attract the wrong type .
the trains have improved so .
fatal .
what are five miles from the station these days ?
sir harry , how about spinsters as tenants ?
most certainly !
that is , if they are gentlewomen .
indeed they are .
miss teresa and miss catharine alan .
i met them in italy .
sir harry , beware of these gentlewomen .
only let to a man .
provided , of course , he' s clean .
you' d love the miss alans .
i don' t think i' d like anyone at that pensione .
wasn' t there a lady novelist and a free thinking father and son ?
i have no profession .
my attitude quite indefensible is that , if i trouble no one , i may do as i like .
it is , i dare say , an example of my decadence .
you' re very fortunate .
leisure is a wonderful opportunity .
don' t slouch , lucy .
go and talk to mrs. pool .
ask her about her leg .
would cecil and i be missed if we went for a walk ?
i think it would be all right .
don' t get your frock muddied .
it' s disgusting the way an engagement is regarded as public property .
all those old women smirking .
one has to go through it .
they won' t notice us much next time .
but their whole attitude is wrong .
an engagement horrid word in the first place is a private matter and should be regarded as such .
oh .
there' s your philosophizing parson .
don' t you like mr. beebe ?
i never said so .
i consider him far above the average .
mr. beebe , i' ve had a wonderful idea .
i' m going to write to our miss alans and ask them to take sir harry' s villa .
sir harry deserves a tenant as vulgar as himself .
oh , mr. vyse , he' s really very nice .
gentlewomen !
yuck !
acting the little god down here with his patronage and his sham aesthetics , and everyone is taken in .
i' il write to them , and if you' d also send a word ?
certainly .
a highly suitable addition to our little community .
goodness , how cross you are !
it was that miserable tea party and all those dreadful people .
and not being alone with you .
hmm .
italy and london are the places where i feel i truly belong .
i am something of an inglese italianato .
e un diavolo incarnato .
you know the proverb ?
i somehow think you feel more at home with me in a room .
never in the real country like this .
i think you' re right .
when i do think of you , it is always in a room .
this is the sacred lake .
very picturesque , but hardly a lake .
more of a puddle .
freddy loves to bathe here .
he' s very fond of it .
and you ?
i used to bathe here , too .
until i was found out .
lucy .
hmm ?
yes , i suppose we ought to be going .
i want to ask you something that i have never asked before .
what , cecil ?
yes ?
i have never kissed you .
no .
you haven' t .
may i now ?
well , of course you may , cecil .
you might before .
i can' t run at you .
i' m sorry .
mother' s right .
those people charlotte and i met at the pensione , they were all rather extraordinary .
0ur neighbor and friend , sir harry 0tway , has a villa in summer street for which he needs a tenant .
i immediately thought of you .
" the house has the added attraction
that it stands exactly across the road from the reverend beebe' s church .
i told him of my plan to lure you hither , and he is in complete agreement
and says he is writing today to urge you to consider our little corner of surrey .
yours sincerely , lucy honeychurch . " there .
goodnight .
goodnight .
oh , dear .
goodnight .
goodnight .
goodnight .
see you friday .
that will be all , rose .
thank you .
thank you , madam .
goodnight , rose .
make lucy one of us .
lucy' s becoming wonderful .
her music always was wonderful .
but she' s purging off that honeychurch taint .
you know what i mean .
not quoting the servants or asking how the pudding is made .
mind you marry her next january .
her music , the style of her ... how she kept to schubert when , like an idiot , i wanted beethoven .
schubert was right for this evening .
mother , i shall have our children educated just like lucy .
bring them up among honest country folk for freshness , send them to italy for ... subtlety .
and not till then bring them to london .
not a day beyond january .
cecil ... darling .
so , you do love me , little thing ?
lucy !
i want to show her this letter from the miss alans .
the tiresome miss alans .
i hate their " if " ing and " but " ing .
well , now they' re really coming .
i had a letter from miss teresa asking how often the butcher called .
my reply impressed her favorably .
lucy ?
go for her .
get her round the shins .
freddy , be careful !
you really are savages , you know .
impossible to make oneself heard .
don' t you want to hear about the miss alans ?
who ?
sir harry' s new tenants .
that wasn' t the name .
wasn' t whose name ?
sir harry' s tenants .
i met him this morning and he said ,
i have procured desirable tenants .
i said , " hurray , " and slapped him on the back .
exactly .
the miss alans .
more like anderson .
i knew there' d be another muddle .
i' m always right .
only freddy' s muddle , who doesn' t even know their name .
yes , i do .
i' ve got it .
it was emerson .
what a weathercock sir harry is .
i hope they' re the right kind of people .
yes , freddy , there is a right and a wrong sort .
these must be all right .
they' re friends of cecil' s .
cecil ?
so you can all call in perfect safety .
cecil ? !
we met some emersons in florence .
the oddest people , mrs. honeychurch , but we rather liked them .
emerson' s a common enough name .
so really desirable .
i' ve telegraphed them .
don' t be silly , freddy .
you always overdo it .
a most remarkable father and son .
father' s something of a radical .
the son , full of possibilities .
don' t move .
stay where you are .
ginevra de benci " !
did you know you were a leonardo , smiling at things beyond our ken ?
what' s this about sir harry' s new tenants ?
i have found him tenants for his cissie villa .
i' ve won a great victory for the comic muse .
after all the trouble i took over the miss alans .
of course i' d prefer friends of yours ...
friends of mine ?
the joke is to come .
they' re strangers i met in the national gallery .
they had been to italy .
a father and son .
the oddest couple .
in the course of conversazione , they said they wanted a country cottage .
a simple burrow where they could smell the earth .
of course , london has its own character , but we' ve a longing for green things growing , don' t we , george ?
the sweetness of the english countryside ... of wet hedgerows with birds singing inside them .
i know we should make our heaven and earth where we are .
however , i fear i' ve faltered and need some help from outside .
well , in short , sir , what i seek is a country cottage where george can come at weekends .
i happen to know of just the place .
not exactly a cottage , more ... a villa .
dear sir , i implore you ...
if you' d give me your card ...
i fear we have no card , but george will write down the address .
sir harry otway .
it is in surrey , a place called summer street .
summer street !
i' ve dreamed of summer street .
it will teach that snob sir harry a lesson .
the classes should mix , there should be intermarriage .
i believe in democracy .
no , you don' t !
you don' t know what the word means .
it isn' t fair !
i' ve probably met them before .
perfectly fair if it punishes a snob .
i blame you .
you had no business to undo my work about the miss alans .
you' ve scored off sir harry , but at my expense .
it was most disloyal of you .
temper , lucy , temper .
please !
hello ?
hello .
i' ve brought someone to see you .
one minute .
byron .
exactly .
a shropshire lad " .
never heard of it .
the way of all flesh " .
never heard of it .
hello ?
george reads german .
i' m certain that' s old emerson .
what are those people doing ?
hello !
wait on , mr. beebe .
this is mr. honeychurch .
how do you do ?
how do you do ?
come in .
come and have a bathe !
i' d like that .
what a conversational opening !
how do you do ?
come and have a bathe .
emerson , this is honeychurch .
you remember his sister .
oh , yes .
how do you do ?
glad to see you .
very glad to hear your sister is marrying .
i' m sure she' il be ... happy .
we know mr. vyse , too .
he' s been very ... kind .
go and bathe .
it will do you good .
then all come back for some tea .
do you really want this bathe ?
yes , i' ve said so .
bye , emerson .
bring some milk and honey and ... er , cakes .
cakes !
yours is glorious country , honeychurch !
as a matter of fact , coincidence is much rarer than we suppose .
for example , on reflection , it' s not coincidental that you' re here now .
i have reflected .
it' s fate .
everything is fate .
you' ve not reflected .
let me cross examine you .
where did you meet mr. vyse ?
the national gallery .
looking at italian art .
you see ?
you talk of coincidence and fate .
you' re naturally drawn to things italian , as are we and all our friends .
that narrows the field immeasurably .
it is fate , but call it italy if it pleases you , vicar .
are you bathing , mr. beebe ?
don' t be shy !
why not ?
oh , it' s wonderful !
simply ripping .
hurry up , emerson !
come along , mr. beebe !
i may as well wash , too .
here goes .
race you round it !
in xanadu did kubla khan a stately pleasure dome decree ...
you' ve gone too far !
really , i ...
i have a boot !
and some trousers ...
graces alive !
come this way immediately !
who were those unfortunate people ?
this way , mrs. honeychurch .
follow me .
oh , dears .
look away !
poor mr. beebe , too !
you' re treading on me !
it is you !
why not have a comfortable bath at home with hot and cold laid on ?
mother !
you' re in no position to argue .
come , lucy .
oh , look !
no , don' t look !
poor mr. beebe !
poor charlotte .
poor , poor charlotte !
standard reaction to any letter from cousin charlotte .
poor , poor charlotte !
this is serious .
her boiler is to be had out and the cistern cleaned and all kinds of to doing .
i think we should ask her to stay .
give her a holiday while the plumbers finish .
no !
we' re squeezed to death with freddy' s friend and minnie beebe .
freddy , must you ?
the truth is , you don' t like charlotte .
well , she gets on my nerves .
the time she met cecil , she drove him quite frantic .
so , please , don' t worry us this last summer .
spoil us by not asking her to come .
hear , hear .
we vote no miss bartlett .
this isn' t very kind of you two .
you have each other and poor charlotte ...
again !
poor charlotte . ... has the water turned off and plumbers .
strike the concertina' s melancholy string
blow the spirit stirring harp like anything
let the piano' s martial blast
rouse the echoes of the past
they played their next sonata , let me see
medulla oblongata , key of g ...
however , we' re in e flat .
wasn' t it any good ?
it' s lovely , dear .
then they began to sing
that extremely lovely thing
scherzando ma non troppo , p , p , p
scherzando ma non troppo , p , p , p
is anything the matter with cecil ?
because otherwise , i cannot account for him .
whenever i speak , he winces .
i see him , lucy .
it' s useless to contradict me .
no doubt , i am not artistic nor literary nor intellectual .
your father bought the drawing room furniture , and we must put up with it .
cecil doesn' t mean to be uncivil .
he explained .
it' s ugly things that upset him .
he' s not uncivil to people .
is it a thing or a person when freddy sings ?
you can' t expect a really musical person to appreciate comic songs as we do .
must he sneer and spoil everyone' s pleasure ?
go and dress , dear .
all right , mother .
sunday week , i want to ask george emerson up for some tennis .
oh , no , freddy ...
oh , he' s topping .
he' s spiffing !
george emerson is simply ripping !
what a noise you' re making .
freddy , let lucy go .
hook me behind .
need we have charlotte ?
we needn' t .
and now freddy wants to ask the emersons .
well , he needn' t .
and you' re not pleased with cecil .
kiss me .
well , of course , if you want charlotte to come , with her boiler and everything ...
she' s been so kind to me .
kiss me again .
would you like it closed ?
oh , thank you .
thank you so much .
pleasure .
oh , porter !
could you ... ?
the ticket says dorking .
that was the last station .
how very vexing !
i shall have to get a cab .
mr. emerson .
what are you doing here ?
my father lives here .
i' ve come for the weekend .
are you all right ?
oh , yes .
oh , lucy , i met him at the station .
i had no idea .
oh , my poor lucia !
my dear marian , what a stupid blunder .
you' il never forgive me .
oh !
freddy , pay the cab .
no , i must .
i absolutely insist .
oh , how do you do , mr. vyse ?
and mr. floyd , a friend of freddy' s .
i insist i pay for my cab .
and this is minnie , mr. beebe' s niece .
grant me that .
here you are .
thank you , sir .
i insist , absolutely .
all right .
five shillings and a bob for the driver .
we all have our foibles , and mine is prompt settling of accounts .
does anyone have any change ?
how much is ... ?
who do i give the sovereign to ?
toss for it , honeychurch .
all right .
no .
i know i' m a spoilsport , but it would make me wretched .
it would be robbing the one who lost .
freddy owes me 15 shillings , so it works out all right if you give the pound to me .
fifteen shillings to you ?
how so , mr. vyse ?
because fifteen and five shillings make a pound .
why is mr. vyse taking the quid ?
no , thank you !
have some tea .
what about mr. floyd' s ten shi ... ?
and why doesn' t she pay the bob for the driver ?
a shilling for the driver .
of course .
how kind of you to remind me .
does anyone have change for half a crown ?
cecil , give that sovereign to me .
mary can change it , and we' il start from the beginning .
oh , dear .
i am sorry .
what a nuisance i am !
poor charlotte !
mary , have you got any change ?
for a sovereign .
have you told him about him ?
no , i haven' t , nor anyone .
i promised you i shouldn' t .
here' s your money .
it' s all shillings except two half crowns .
you can settle your debt nicely now .
how dreadful .
how more than dreadful if mr. vyse should hear from another source .
there is no other source .
george would tell mr. emerson .
he would tell no one .
how do you know ?
because i know .
shall we go out ?
dear , a moment .
we may not have this chance again .
have you spoken to him yet ?
i have seen him .
stop thinking he admires me or any nonsense of that sort .
he doesn' t .
not one straw .
freddy , stop it !
no , poor minnie .
no , not me .
get off !
lucy !
lucy !
what' s that book ?
who' s been leaving books out to spoil ?
it' s only a library book of cecil' s .
well , pick it up .
it' s a special collection .
i forget what for , but i beg , no vulgar clinking ha' pennies in the plate .
make sure minnie has a sixpence .
where is the child ?
dear , i' m so sorry , i don' t seem to have any small change .
could you ... ?
yes , easily .
gracious , how smart you look !
what a lovely frock .
go on .
goodbye .
be good .
' no place on earth as glorious as this where love is spoken face to face .
so he cried , ' utter rapture !
the silvered twilight , the wraith like swallows ,
' the perfume of the cooling earth all fill me with inutterable and inestimable bliss . '
and so , locked in mortal combat , they brought to life the eternal ...
they brought to life the eternal battle where men stand face to face
to slowly gird , to bravely fight , to stoutly dare ...
listen , lucy .
three split infinitives .
and then the cry was heard , ' once more into the breach , my friends . " '
victory , mr. floyd !
the scene is set in florence .
the sunset .
the sunset of italy .
did you mind losing ?
of course .
you' re not such a splendid player .
the light was in my eyes .
i never said i was .
under orcagna' s loggia the loggia de lanzi , as we call it now ...
what' s the title ?
" under a loggia " by eleanor lavish .
eleanor lavish !
my goodness !
do you remember her , mr. emerson ?
of course .
no wonder the novel' s so bad .
still , one ought to read it , i suppose .
there' s an absurd account of a view .
do read it .
do you like our view , mr. emerson ?
my father says there' s only one perfect view the view of the sky over our heads .
i expect your father has been reading dante .
do read it .
not while mr. emerson is entertaining us .
no , do .
nothing' s funnier than silly things read aloud .
mr. emerson finds us frivolous .
look for tennis balls , mr. emerson .
do i have to ?
no , of course not .
it' s in chapter two .
find me chapter two .
give it here .
no , it' s the silliest thing .
come on .
cecil !
thank you .
a ha .
afar off , the towers of florence .
and she wandered as though in a dream through the wavering sea of barley ,
touched with crimson stains of poppies .
all unobserved , he came to her .
isn' t it immortal ?
there came from his lips no wordy protestations such as formal lovers use .
no eloquence was his , nor did he need it .
he simply enfolded her in his manly arms ...
no , this isn' t the bit .
it' s further on .
shall we go in to tea ?
by all means .
excuse me .
charlotte , a minute .
cecil , ask mary for sandwiches .
i' il be with you in a moment .
do you know miss lavish' s novel ?
there' s a scene in it the hero and heroine make love .
do you know about that ?
do you know about it ?
they' re on a hillside and florence is in the distance .
there are poppies and a barley field .
it can' t be coincidence .
how could you tell her ? !
oh , lucy !
oh , dearest girl !
she hasn' t put that in her novel ?
never , never more shall eleanor lavish be a friend of mine .
so you did tell .
why ? !
when you wouldn' t even let me tell mother ?
cecil read it to me .
and that man insulted me again behind cecil' s back .
why did you tell her ?
what made you ? !
even if you forgive me , i shall never forgive myself ... till my dying day .
go and call him .
call mr. vyse ?
no .
the other one .
i' il deal with him myself .
you missed a good match , miss bartlett .
charlotte , please stay .
mr. emerson , leave this house and don' t come back as long as i' m here .
i can' t .
no discussion .
go , please .
i don' t want to call in mr. vyse .
you mean to marry that man ?
you' re being ridiculous .
i' d have held back if cecil was different .
but he' s the sort who can' t know anyone intimately , least of all a woman .
he doesn' t know what a woman is .
he wants you for a possession , to look at like a painting or an ivory box .
something to own and to display .
he doesn' t want you to be real , to think and to live .
he doesn' t love you .
but i love you .
i want you to have your own thoughts and ideas , even when i hold you in my arms .
miss bartlett , you wouldn' t stop us , not if you understood .
it' s our last chance .
do you understand how lucky people are to find what' s right for them ?
it' s such a blessing , don' t you see ?
and the fact i love cecil and shall be his wife shortly is of no importance ?
this tremendous thing has happened between us and it means ... it means nothing must hinder us ever again .
you have to understand that .
i' ve no idea what you mean .
everyone must understand .
and you must leave .
it was wrong of me to listen to you .
but you haven' t been listening .
if you had , you would know !
leave at once .
now .
lucy ...
no , i will not listen to one more word .
my dears , do stop .
haven' t you done enough ?
don' t interfere again .
it' s useless .
let me go , miss bartlett .
let mr. emerson go , charlotte .
i shall never forgive myself .
you always say that , but you always do forgive yourself .
why does italy make lady novelists reach such summits of absurdity ?
lucy , it' s still light enough for another set .
mr. emerson has had to go .
what a nuisance .
i say , cecil , do play , there' s a good chap .
just this once .
it' s floyd' s last day .
freddy , as you remarked this morning , some chaps are good for nothing but books .
i plead guilty to being such a chap .
because i wouldn' t play tennis ?
i never do play tennis .
i never could .
forget tennis .
it was just the last straw .
i' m sorry , i can' t marry you .
one day you' il be glad i said so .
we' re too different .
but i ...
i love you .
and ...
i did think you loved me .
i did not .
i thought i did at first .
i' m sorry .
as for your loving me , you don' t , not really .
you don' t .
it' s only as something else .
as something you own .
a painting , a leonardo .
i don' t want to be a leonardo , i want to be myself .
oh , let' s not go on now .
i' il only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards .
you don' t love me , evidently .
i dare say you' re right not to ... ... but it would help a little , hurt a little less , if i knew why .
because ... ... you can' t know anyone intimately , least of all a woman .
i don' t mean exactly that , but you will go on asking questions .
you wrap yourself up in art , and want to wrap me up , so i' m breaking it off .
it' s true .
true , on the whole .
you' re so different tonight , like a different person speaking with a new voice .
what do you mean ?
if you think i love someone else , you' re mistaken .
of course i don' t .
i only meant that ... there was a ... force in you i hadn' t known of up to now .
if a girl breaks off her engagement , everyone thinks , " oh , she has someone else .
it' s disgusting , brutal !
forgive me if i say stupid things .
my brain has gone to pieces .
i think we' d better go to bed , if you don' t mind .
let me do that for you .
i must actually thank you for what you' ve done .
for showing me what i really am .
i admire your courage .
will you shake hands ?
of course i will , cecil .
goodnight .
i' m sorry about it .
thank you for taking it so well .
since the days are chillier now and we' ve not , alas , a home of our own , my sister feels we might benefit by travel to a warmer clime .
the doctor has ordered her special bread , but we can take that with us .
it is only getting first into a steamer and then a train .
hello .
so you' re off , mr. vyse ?
yes .
i' ve come to show miss honeychurch a letter from our friends the miss alans .
since florence did my sister so much good , we think we should try athens this winter .
isn' t it wonderful ?
the parthenon , the frieze of phydias .
have you ever met these miss alans ?
never .
then you cannot appreciate the romance of this visit .
i' ve never been myself , nor do i have any plans to go .
altogether too big for our little lot , don' t you agree ?
got any matches ?
thank you .
you' re quite right .
greece is not for our little lot .
goodbye .
goodbye .
mr. beebe !
matches !
matches !
cecil' s hard hit .
lucy won' t marry him .
when ?
late last night .
i must go .
will they want me to go down ?
yes .
goodbye .
all right , powell .
no , charlotte .
not the scissors , not when my hands are full .
good afternoon .
how do you do , mr. beebe ?
good gracious !
what a mess things are !
yes .
everyone' s so horrid today , uncle arthur .
let' s go out to tea .
good idea .
get your hat and coat and i' il take you .
i' il take minnie to the beehive tavern .
care to join us , miss bartlett ?
oh , yes , charlotte !
i don' t mind .
no .
you have no one to help .
my services are better than nothing .
oh , dear , marian .
i' m so sorry .
a delightful letter from the miss alans .
they' re going to greece .
i' il read you some .
dear mr. beebe , i doubt we shall go any further than athens ,
but , if you know of a good pensione in constantinople , we should be so grateful .
isn' t that delightful ?
i do believe they' il end by going round the world .
delightful .
miss honeychurch , your brother has told me .
did he ?
i needn' t say it will go no further .
mother ...
charlotte ...
cecil ...
freddy ... you ...
if i may say so , i' m certain you' ve done the right thing .
tell me more of the miss alans .
how splendid of them to go abroad .
i want them to start from venice and then go by cargo steamer down the illyrian coast .
did freddy say he' d drive straight back ?
no , he didn' t .
i hope he won' t gossip .
how splendid of them to go .
i wish they' d take me .
would your mother spare you ?
she must .
i simply must go away .
i have to .
don' t you see i have to go away ?
charlotte , the miss alans are going to constantinople .
no , only to athens .
i' ve longed to go to constantinople ...
athens , i mean .
in lieu of constantinople , could not we lure you to tea at the beehive ?
no , thank you .
oh , well , minnie , you and i must eat alone .
good afternoon .
good afternoon , mr. beebe .
you must persuade mother .
what ?
don' t you see ?
i must go somewhere .
anywhere !
i must get away , far , before it' s known .
what ?
that i' ve broken off my engagement .
he mustn' t get any ideas .
you mean mr. emerson ?
charlotte , how slow you are .
there must be no gossip at summer street , but to go as far as greece !
i thought you' d be the first to go to mother and say lucy must go to greece .
lucy , are you absolutely sure ?
i only want to do what is right for you .
i' m telling you what' s right .
don' t argue , do it !
all right .
thank you , freddy .
why does she look like that ?
like what ?
like charlotte bartlett .
because ... she is charlotte bartlett .
stop thine ear against the singer
from the red gold , keep thy finger
the tune' s fine , but the words are rotten .
marian ?
oh , charlotte !
lucy has a plan .
isn' t this a tragedy ?
i get one thing tied up and another thing falls over .
the misses alan are going to greece .
good luck to them .
lucy would like to join them as far as athens .
she' d what ? !
and on to delphi if the roads are safe .
vacant heart and hand and eye
easy live and quiet die
vacant heart and hand and eye
easy live and quiet die
you can take all those , but leave me thoreau till i go .
i need him by me now .
it' s an ugly house .
we never liked it .
i mustn' t miss the train .
the removers can do the rest .
oh , i ...
no .
i don' t want you straining your back .
i won' t be down at the weekend .
there' s no point .
i' il come to take you back to town the week after .
paper soap is a great help towards freshening up one' s face on a train .
but you know about these matters , and you have mr. vyse to help you .
a gentleman is such a standby .
it' s so good of mr. vyse to spare you .
perhaps he will join you later .
or does work keep him in london ?
we shall meet him when he sees you off .
no one will see lucy off .
she doesn' t like it .
really ?
but , in this case ...
you aren' t going ?
yes , we' ve a train to catch .
it' s been such a pleasure to meet you .
we will write you often and send pretty cards from every place .
thank you so much for taking her .
bye bye .
well , we got through that time .
yes , and were seen through , which is most unpleasant .
i cannot understand this hole and corner business .
you got rid of cecil , well and good .
i' m thankful .
why not announce it ?
i promised .
it' s only for a few days .
victoria station .
i couldn' t help thinking that our dear lucy did not ...
no .
i wish you' d finish your sentences .
you' re getting worse .
... did not look like a bride to be .
how should one look ?
according to your great experience in these matters .
i can' t say exactly .
only ... she lacked something .
and , if you want to know , teresa , she lacked ... radiance .
miss bartlett .
mr. beebe .
what is happening to your neighbors ?
they' re moving .
old mr. emerson' s rheumatism is back , and george thinks it' s too far .
mr. emerson is avoiding the removers inside .
might i impose and wait here for mrs. honeychurch ?
by all means .
i' m afraid you must excuse me .
mr. emerson , miss bartlett , excuse me .
oh , please .
i am sorry that the house has brought on your rheumatism .
it' s not the rheumatism , it' s my boy .
george is so sorry .
i cannot blame him , but i wish he' d told me about it first .
he never told you what happened in italy ?
not a word .
no .
lucy said he wouldn' t .
i was only told last sunday .
what were you told ?
that he loves her .
won' t you sit down ?
i think i hear the carriage .
it would be discourteous to keep my cousin waiting .
there isn' t any carriage .
sit down , my dear .
everyone' s been lying , except george .
and now here' s miss honeychurch marrying mr. vyse in january ...
she has broken off her engagement .
it was all done with great tact and discretion , naturally .
and , for the time being , we would like to keep it quiet .
there' s a time for keeping quiet and there' s a time for speaking out .
now , you don' t hear any carriage .
why don' t you sit back , make yourself more comfortable ?
take this .
there .
you look much better .
so ... she' s not marrying mr. vyse ?
why ?
why greece ?
why rush off to the ends of the earth ?
you' re tired of your home .
you' re tired of windy corner .
and you' re tired of freddy and me .
of course i' m not tired of windy corner , but , as we' re talking about it ,
i shall want to come up to london more .
i might even share a flat for a little with some other girl .
you see , i come into my money next year .
to mess about with typewriters and latchkeys and call it work .
perhaps i spoke hastily .
oh , goodness !
you remind me of charlotte bartlett !
charlotte ? !
charlotte to a t.
i don' t know what you mean .
we are not the least alike .
you never used to be .
can' t we have the hood down ?
can we have the hood down , powell ?
powell , is that house to be let again ?
sir harry' s looking for new tenants , i hear , miss .
what a pity about the emersons .
freddy will be so sorry .
and , indeed , so am i.
all right , powell , stop at the stores .
yes , ma' am .
walk on .
such an agreeable family .
what a pity .
no charlotte .
go and see if she' s at mr. beebe' s .
and do hurry , both of you .
mary has her fish pie in .
did you hear what i said , lucy ?
lucy !
mr. emerson says it' s all his fault .
i told him to trust to love .
i told him , " george , love and do what you will . " it' s what i taught him .
so you see , it is all my fault .
where are you going ?
your mother offered to fetch me in her carriage .
i have not been brought up to keep anyone waiting , least of all a kind hostess .
and now where' s lucy ?
get in .
if mary' s fish pie spoils , she' il mope till next friday .
i will sit here .
nonsense .
i mustn' t inconvenience you .
you know you prefer facing .
i' ve no wish to even hear your son' s name mentioned .
he has misbehaved from the first .
in fact , he behaved abominably .
not abominably .
he only tried when he should not have tried .
no , of course , abominable is too strong a word .
it' s no good discussing this .
george is taking me to london .
he can' t bear to be here , and i must be where he is .
he says the thought of ... seeing you or hearing about you ...
mr. emerson , please don' t go on my account .
i' m going to greece .
don' t leave your comfortable house .
you mustn' t !
why are you going to greece ?
forgive me , but it seems to me you' re in a muddle .
i think the reason you' re going to greece and you' ve broken off your engagement
miss bartlett told me is that ... you love george .
all the light' s gone out of your pretty face .
just like it' s gone out of george .
i can' t bear it , and now i' ve made you cry .
forgive me .
but i' ve got to go to greece now .
the ticket' s bought and everything .
it' s impossible !
there' s only one thing impossible .
that' s to love ... and to part .
lucy !
you love george .
you love the boy body and soul , as he loves you .
but of course i do .
what did you all think ?
then ...
no .
mother' s calling .
i' ve got to go .
they trust me .
why should they ?
when you deceived everyone ... ... including yourself .
charlotte , sit here .
go on , powell .
one week italy , then greece .
greece may be cancelled .
what ? !
do stop !
i think lucy has something to tell us .
stop the horse !
dear charlotte , after an awful journey when our luggage went missing twice , we reached florence .
you' il be glad to hear that the pensione bertolini is its dear self .
the cockney signora still terrorizes the staff .
her guests are another set of miss alans , miss lavish , mr. beebe
and charlotte and lucy .
we were promised rooms with a view .
hush , we mustn' t .
first thing tomorrow , i shall have a bone to pick with the signora .
it' s so unfair !
don' t you agree that , on one' s first visit to florence , one must have a room with a view ?
we have a view .
kiss me again .
again .
i' m reading .
what are you reading ?
it' s from freddy .
what does he say ?
silly boy , he thinks he' s being dignified .
i mean , everybody knew we were going away in the spring .
