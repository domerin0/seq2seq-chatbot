zorgons .
they' re big , gnarly lizards .
cold blooded heatseekers .
and the tiniest spark of warmth will bring them in like moths .
flying all around the galaxy ... ... looking for anything they could find to burn up .
why don' t they just burn up their own planet ?
oh , they already did .
that' s not even the worst of it .
the real problem is their ravenous appetite .
they never stop eating .
what do they eat ?
meat .
that' s good .
dude , you' re meat .
are you doing this to keep zorgons away ?
nope .
i' m doing this because i' ve been eating paste out of a tube for 15 years .
this totally sucks .
why ?
he' s eating all our food .
so ?
lupe just went shopping .
how long do you think we' re gonna be out here ?
it could be weeks .
then what ?
i don' t know .
what about air ?
how long is it gonna last before he breathes it all up ?
i guess .
i' m gonna say something .
no , wait .
walter .
walter .
dude , that' s our food .
yep .
and you' re running low on supplies .
yeah , i know .
you' re eating it all .
well , as i recall , the card said , " rescue stranded astronaut .
looks to me like i' m the only one that' s doing any rescuing ... ... so i don' t think a couple dagwood sandwiches is too much to ask for .
dog , you' re eating it all .
i passed through a time sphincter to get here .
you realize how difficult that is ?
what' s a time sphincter ?
you squeeze through there ... ... and tell me you' re not hungry enough to eat a carpet shark .
sounds like you got a long trip ahead of you .
oh , you telling me to leave ?
well , i mean , once you get finished eating , yeah .
oh , i hate to break it to you , but that' s not your call .
he spun me , so it' s up to him .
well , i' m fleet admiral , and i' m telling you to hit the road .
i apologize , sir .
i didn' t ...
i didn' t realize you were a fleet admiral .
in fact , i ...
i' m a fleet admiral too .
it' s just a card , bug nuts .
well , he wants you to leave too .
that true , danny ?
you want me to split ?
of course he does .
hey , mouthpiece ... ... let him answer , all right ?
i need to hear it from the big guy .
well ...
danny , tell him you want him to leave .
well , he did help out a little .
help ?
he burned our couch and now he' s eating all our food .
you call that helping ?
you know what ?
i' m just gonna go .
i feel like a third wheel anyways .
i mean , you guys are such a tight , unified team here .

what did you wish for ?
this .
you wished for a football ?
signed by brett favre .
why' d you wish for a football ?
you could have just wished the game over .
you could have wished us out of here .
i was under a lot of pressure .
he was yelling at me .
why were you yelling at him ?
okay , guys .
here' s the thing .
i' ve played this game before .
okay ?
i played it with my own brother 15 years ago .
you' re a player ?
yeah .
just like you guys .
we were fighting a lot back then .
and when the game started , it got even worse .
every time we spun , we got madder and madder at one another .
and then i landed on the star space .
the same one that walter just landed on .
well , i was so mad at him , that when the star passed ... ... i made my wish .
what' d you wish for ?
i wished that my brother had never been born .
oh , my god .
soon as i did it , i felt horrible .
i thought , you know , if i could spin again ... ... maybe i ...
i could land on another star space and ...
and wish him back .
but the game wouldn' t let me ... ... because it wasrt my turn .
walter .
there are some games ... ... you can' t play alone .
so , what do we do now ?
we go back downstairs and we finish this thing once and for all .
no more cheating .
no more arguing .
all you guys have to do is spin a few more times .
i' il help you fight off whatever comes out .
deal ?
deal .
