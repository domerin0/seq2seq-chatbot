six months ago , i couldn' t get arrested with a fresh corpse and a smoking gun .

that' s an illusion .
that' s not real .
you know , there are primitive tribes that believe ... you lose a piece of your soul every time your picture' s taken .
after last night , it' s a wonder i have any left .
bo laramie .

it is !
oh , my god !

that' s an illusion .
it' s not real .
life is good .
i guess i' m just gonna keep doin' what i' m doin ' .. until somebody figures out i really don' t know what i' m doin '
yeah, you know , that makes sense .
that sounds like a plan .
hey , buddy .

he' s a good lookin ' boy .
he' s got a birthday comin ' up , doesn' t he ?
you want to take a picture of me ?
i' m right here , okay ?
take a few shots .
' cause you had no right taking pictures of my son .
that' s a point of law , mr. laramie .
i have every right to take pictures of whoever i want in a public park .
yes , i do .
not without my consent you don' t , all right ?
now , come on .
look .
things have changed .
you' re somebody now .
you better get used to this .
oh , yeah ?
i' m somebody now ?
yes , you are .
you' re somebody now .
now your game' s about to start .
it' s a security risk .
i' m asking you nicely , and i' m saying please .
don' t take pictures of my son .
okay .
okay .
you got it , bo .
thank you .
i appreciate it .
i understand .
sure thing , famous guy .
good job , buddy .
you were awesome .
thanks , mom .
i' m proud of you , son .
you did a great job , buddy .
you did a great job .
son of a bitch .
take him to the car .
bo !
what did i tell you ?
i said don' t take another goddamn picture of my family .
you understand that ?
not one more .
yeah ?
kid takes a nice picture .
won' t bring half as much as the ones i have of abby changing zach' s clothes .
the steamy ones ... by the pool .
oh , yeah ?
huh ?
is that bo ?
oh , are you gonna pay .
smile , bo .
you get that ?
ooh , in living color , chief .
cops are on their way .
bo !
hey , bo .
hey , big shot . !
enjoy what' s left of your weekend .
let' s go make some money .
oh , yeah ? huh ?
wow .
we' re told laramie was released late saturday afternoon ... ordered to attend anger management classes ... as part of a plea agreement .
his people tell us the assault charges will likely be dropped ... in lieu of a settlement that could easily cost ... the rising star half a million dollars .
the victim , 34 year old rex harper ... is also demanding a public apology .
our very own giuliana caught up with bo ... on the set of his new action movie .
giuliana ?
thanks , patrick .
and thank you for agreeing to sit down with me .
thanks for having me .
bo, just so we understand what happened ... you became angry at some photographers ... after they were taking pictures of you at a weekend soccer game ?
mr. harper was taking pictures of my son .
i politely asked him to stop , and he didn' t .
so you hit him ?
well , there' s a little bit more to it than that , but, yeah .
this guy is nothing but a low class parasite .
your parasite' s right here .
he' s never gonna get an apology from me .
and ifhe knows what' s good for him , he' il stay away from me and my family .
can you believe this prick ?
strong words .
yeah .
yeah .
i gotta go .
laramie , i' m gonna destroy your life and eat your soul ... and i can' t wait to do it .
well , here' s one for ya .
you' re lucky .
real lucky .
ajudge orders me to spend $400 an hour on therapy ... that i don' t need , and that makes me lucky ?
you' re lucky you' re not in jail .
you' re not in montana anymore , bo .
anger management is not about upgrading from a 20 to a 12 gauge .
the point is ... you' re carrying belief systems from a previous life ... that don' t fit your new reality .
some of your old values may not be valuable anymore .
not here , not now .
well , i disagree .
you don' t mess with a man' s family .
and i' m not gonna change who i am ... to suit my environment or your expectations .
i got to where i am by doing things my own way .
oh , i think the judge would agree with you .
that' s not what i meant , but
no , i know that .
look , your , uh your time here it' s gonna give you the tools to better deal with situations like last saturday' s .
and i' m considerably cheaper than mr. harper .
all right .
is that it ?
for now , yes .
and , uh , if you have a problem , i want you to call me .
all right .
thank you .
i' il see you next week .
thanks , phil .
clear .
must be cold as hell this time of year .
huh ?
switzerland .
what do you mean ?
it says here
this came out of the u. k. , so it must be true " unnamed sources say ...
laramie chartered a private jet to switzerland .
while there the young star reportedly underwent a penile enhancement ... surprising his wife with it on her birthday .
nice , huh ?
you give it a name ?
big bo " ?
the albatross " ?
something sexy for the bedroom , to keep it fun .
i' m going to .
bo , can we get you for a lineup in here ?
yeah , yeah .
yeah , no problem .
it' s nice , how they caught me .
yeah .
y you want to show it to me ?
can' t keep anything a secret these days .
you got the work done , you might as well let people see it .
if it' s big like that , w why would you want to hide it ?
be nicer to him .
things have changed around here .
take a look .
oye .
amigos .
you got the stuff , huh ?
s .
thank you .
muchas gracias , amigos .
merci .
sure , man .
pinche americano , est loco .
este buey est zafado .

what time do they open ?
does that usually work where you come from ?
yeah , a couple of times .
leave !
now !
can you believe that guy ?
i thought he was kind of cute .
loser .
and you' re considering this ?
all i' m saying is they called .
those schmucks over at web pics are turning this friggin ' business into a trout farm .
celebrities getting approval over paparazzi' s photos ?
that' s bullshit !
the public wants raw and real , and that' s what we give them .
let me tell you something , my friends .
we' re the last of the real hunters .
i' il drink to that .
like those shots you got of lopez .
now , they were the shit .
and you are a dog .
damn straight .
i made bank on ' em too .
i spent three nights hidin ' in that tree .
ants crawlin ' all over my ass .
i picked her off with a thousand mil from 120 yards out .
it was beautiful .
yeah .
too bad it wasn' t really lopez .
nobody knows that .
let me tell you something , kevin .
don' t start sweatin ' the small stuff, okay ?
or you' il get soft , end up like the rest of those pussies working at the agencies .
hey , i' m here , ain' t i ?
hanging with you and rex , who is , by the way , still the king .
hundred and five thousand dollars for that shot of clooney in the woods .
ohh hoo .
yeah , clooney' s been a real gold mine .
how' d it go , huh ?
she' s a lesbian .
really ?
i' m gonna get a second opinion .
god , you get a lot of lesbians .
let' s go .
excuse me .
buy you another round ?
yeah .
hey , dan dana .
i guess you can afford it .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
you think i wouldn' t recognize the guy ... that siphoned half a million dollars out of bo laramie ?
hey , i saw you get your ass kicked on tv .
look , i' m a photojournalist .
i was doing my job .
mm hmm .
i was assaulted , and justice was served .
with the exception of laramie' s apology to me .
i like reading the tabloids .
i think they' re fun .
i think you' re drunk .
i think you' re cute .
your pictures hurt people .
do they ?
the irony
marcy .
marcy ... is everyone wants to have steak , but nobody wants to date the butcher .
my job is to provide a window of reality for society .
it' s up to them whether they want to look through it or not .
come on .
have you ever bought a tabloid ?
guilty as charged .
don' t feel guilty .
guilty' s bad .
i mean , everyone wants to have a
little peek , huh ?
see ?
it' s human nature .
look , there' s a there' s a premiere tonight ... and an after party i' m covering .
come with me , as my guest ... and , um , see things from an entirely different perspective mine .
hey , do a shot with me and then tell me your story .
i' m a good listener .
really ?
uh huh .
listen to this no .
what do you say , marcy ?
you want to have a little adventure ?
it' s beautiful .

mm hmm .
the wine you mu you must have put something in it
obviously it made you quite amorous .
it' s a shame , marcy , you don' t remember it .
still going to the police to tell them who caused laramie' s accident ?
think again !
not only will i attach that to every porno site on the internet ...
i will make sure it finds its way to your father' s desk at the state department .

i tracked down those paparazzi guys you told me about .
brought ' em in one at a time .
they all came up with the same story .
oh , yeah ?
what story' s that ?
well , they never deny following you .
they say they drove up on the accident ... called 911 and never left until help arrived .
detective , that' s bullshit .
you hear me ?
come on , man .
give me a break , will ya ?
i' m just tellin ' you what i got .
until i find someone who saw somethin ' different , that' s all i have .

i' m startin ' to feel much more in control of my anger .
well , that' s quite a leap in progress .
especially considering your recent tragedy .
yeah .
well , i can' t let the fact that four paparazzis nearly killed my family ... affect my behavior , now , can i ?
what do you mean by that , bo ?
well , you asked me to work on something , and , uh , i did .
well , surely you must have some feelings about what happened .
i feel cheated .
i' m angry .
blessed .
all at the same time .
what' s this ?
ajournal .
i want you to start recording specific events that prompt your anger ... and how you dealt with them in the moment .
doing this will help you put a face on your problems .
my problems already have faces , dr. kelley .
well , then you' re moving in the right direction .
let this journal become a sanctuary for you , bo .
my clients are having great success with it .
really ?
this shit happens way too often .
this kid never even hit the brakes .
this guy ain' t no kid .
he' s close to 40 .
they call ' em rolex riders .
they hang out in beverly hills , wear expensive leathers .
same guy cuts all their hair .
pity .
he was cute .
hey , fellas .
detective burton , s. i. s.
you boys mind if i sniff around ?
knock yourself out , detective .
hey , why' s special investigations ... sending a d 2 down to a traffic accident ?
well , i heard your victim' s name on the radio .
he was part of a case that i' ve been working on .
it' s probably nothing .
i just thought i' d look around .
here you go , sweetie .
thank you .
sure .
anything else ?
mm mmm .
i' m fine .
okay .
one second .
all right ?
hello .
oh , hi , bo .
it' s detective burton .
hey , detective .
i hope i' m not bothering you .
no , no , no .
we just got back from the hospital .
any change ?
no , no .
no change .
but thanks for asking .
so , what' s up ?
well , you remember that guy kevin rosner ?
he was killed earlier today in a motorcycle accident .
the the name sounds familiar .
wh
he was one of the photographers that was involved in your accident .
oh .
well , that' s too bad , isn' t it ?
i just thought you' d like to know .
yeah , well , i appreciate you calling .
okay .
bo !
all right .
okay .
chrissy !
hey , baby .
hey .
what do you got ?
just like i expected .
cops refused to release kevin' s personal effects .
then what are we doin '  would you let me finish ?
i said i expected it .
so i slapped ' em with a bogus power of attorney .
they didn' t have any choice .
ready for the good news ?
cheryl .
do you mind , love ?
check this out .
kevin . !
even in death , they can' t shut him up .
hey , cheryl .
call richard .
tell him to hold the cover .
hello , debra .
can you get me through to richard ?
we got something here .
we need to speak with him now .
bo ?
bo !
howdy .
hey , detective .
how are you ?
good .
how you doin ' ?
okay .
good to see you .
yeah , things are good .
you want a cup of coffee ?
i' d love one .
thanks .
let' s take a walk .
i' il show you around .
okay .
listen , the other day after i hung up with you i did some digging around .
we' re dealing with real scumbags here , bo .
this guy leonard clark ?
he used to be an attorney .
he got himself disbarred for distribution of narcotics .
is that right ?
what do you think the son of a bitch does ?
he turns around and sues the police department for illegal search and seizure .
cost the city a million bucks just to make it go away .
he' s still on probation for possession of illegal firearms .
really .
and this other guy harper ?
the guy you slapped around ?
he slimed his way out of an attempted rape charge .
guess who the attorney was .
leonard clark ?
yeah .
and by the way , you' re not the first deep pockets he got into .
this actor , andy baldwin ?
alec ?
yeah .
one of those baldwin guys .
anyway , he slaps harper around .
harper takes him to the cleaners ... and then harper moves into a boat in the marina .
now , listen , bo ... until i get this thing straightened out
i know that you actors have people and places you wanna keep confidential .
right .
if i were you , i would be very careful about what i said on my cell phone .
really .
why' s that ?
because for a couple hundred dollars ... you can go to your local radio guy ... and you can drop in on anybody at any time .
bo , we' re ready for you on set .
okay .
listen , detective , thanks for coming by .
i appreciate it .
i' il speak to you soon .
okay ?
thank you .
thank you .
i' m scared for zach .
i
part of me just wants to take him back to montana where he can feel secure .
i don' t think he' s gonna get that here .
hey , reg .
where you at , man ?
yeah , i just got here .
nicole kidman' s coming by for a lunch meeting .
i' m on it .
see you in a sec .
you hear that , leonard , you piece of shit ?
sorry , man .
can' t let you slide .
mr. laramie' s orders .
do you mind ?
yes , i do .
what' s going on , reg ?
uninvited guest .
oh , yeah ?
i don' t see anybody hurt or naked .
you sure you' re in the right place , leonard ?
very funny .
ha ha ha ha .
get rid of him , reg .
you heard him .
don' t touch me !
i' m leaving .
emergency response .
listen , there' s a guy with a blue metallic volvo station wagon
he' s waving a gun all over the place !
what is your location ?
westbound on sunset boulevard !
we' re coming up to western now !
his license number is abm543 .
he' s a white guy !

and i' il let you stay up as late as you want ... until 10 : 00 .
do you want a new bike ?
we need you to wake up .
one man is dead in what people are describing as a bizarre " suicide by cop .
the victim , leonard clark , pointed a weapon at several officers ... who were forced to open fire ... killing the man instantly .
details are still sketchy , but police are describing the weapon ... as a modified .
45 caliber blank gun ... commonly used in the motion picture industry .
we' re awaiting a press conference by the authorities ... and we' il bring it to you live , when it happens .
hi .
you' ve reached wendell stokes photography .

the case is under investigation .
look , he' s coming for us next , man .
you know that .
yeah , but at least we' il know when he' s coming .
the cops don' t go after him , wendell ... we will .
did you get those from rudy ?
yep .
oh , these are beauties .
they' il transmit to my system perfectly .

i heard that .
bo ...
i' ve now got two dead paparazzi ... that were involved in your accident .
i wish i could tell you more about these clowns .
it' s
i don' t know , it just takes a certain kind of person ... that would do something like this .
complete and utter distortion of the truth .
welcome to my world , detective .
i' il tell you , bo ...
i don' t know what i would do if anyone ever hurt one of my family .
i' m running up against it on this one , bo .
what do you think ?
i think you' re dealing with a random accident and a suicide .

the investigators are still looking into it .
and now ...
i' ve got this gun .

paul sends his apologies .

wife never got a look at the guy , huh ?
nah , she didn' t .

i know you got something up your sleeve .
the idea of going in there , wendell ... was to protect ourselves .
if we were worried laramie was coming after us before , we have guaranteed it now .
why don' t we just call the cops ?
and tell them ... we broke into his house ... you attacked his wife ... and that we would like some protection ?
you' re a moron , wendell .
you' re an absolute moron !
what did you expect me to do ?

how did you know it was me ?
' cause , uh , i can see your car .
i i' il let you in .
hey .
you caught me .
i was in the shower .
how did my guys do last night ?
were they okay ?
they were great .
i got a great night of sleep thanks to them .
glad to hear it .
i got something i' d like you to take a look at .
it' il only take a minute .
is everything all right ?
great .
what is this ?
impound found some video equipment ... in the back of leonard' s car .
seems he was wearing a miniature camera when he came to the set .
why are we watching this ?
oh, just be patient .
best part is the end .
okay , now ... watch this very closely .
there .
it' s a jacket .
and there was something about that jacket ... that was bothering me .
and then it hit me .
the boys at the crime lab prepared this for me .
now , you' il notice that in the first shot ... the lapels are facing away from us .
in the second shot ... the lapels are facing towards us .
and ?
i was wondering how the jacket removed itself from its hook ... and turned itself around .
you see , the button cam is all one shot it' s unedited , uninterrupted .
and leonard left his car and came back only once .
you know what i think ?
i think someone on that set ... planted the gun .
excuse me .
burton .
i' m on my way .
you don' t want your disc ?
keep it .
we got the original .
ma' am , my name is detective burton .
i' m from the los angeles police department ... and i' m here to talk to you about the night of april 18 .
they lied to you , detective .
they caused the accident that night .
