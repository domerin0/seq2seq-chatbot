" if he leans backwards ...
you won' t sell anything . ... you' re losing him " .
buying and selling .
buying and selling , but with the body .
see ?

i we don' t move forward , we move backwards .
if we don' t update our methods we are lost .

so i had to go to deseado ... ... to get it .
it was a long trip , so i took uglyface with me ... ... to keep me company .
when i got there , i had to read ... small letters .
i could hardly see them .
when i was going back ... ... the sun was on my face ... ... i couldn' t see anything ... ... it blinded me .
suddenly i run a guy over .
didn' t see him .
sometimes it' s fate .
i couldn' t think clearly .
so i left him there ... ... on the road .
that was when uglyface ... ... got mad at me .
he howled all night long .
in the morning he was gone .
don' t you want to lie down ?
no .
have you got a place to stay ?
no , but don' t worry .
there' s a shack here , sometimes i sleep there .
