but i tell you what .
if you' re not downstairs in five minutes ,

he locked me in the closet and left me to die .

he thinks he can mess with me .
911 .
oh , man .

well , well , well .
i' il be damned .
if it isn' t paul crewe .
so , what did i do wrong ?
was i driving poorly ?
nope .
nope .
this car was reported stolen .
no , no , no .
it' s actually my girlfriend' s car .
shit happens .
shit does happen .
i mean , look what happened to your ears .
i gotta ask you something .
does he get xm radio with those ?
actually , they get a couple of channels .
it' s paul crewe .
another question , though .
santa claus .
what' s he like ?
boy , i hate to arrest a public figure like yourself , but , hell , i don' t think you got too many endorsement deals to worry about , now , do you ?
now , listen here , mr. frodo .
don' t get short with me .
that was good .
i mean , he' s good .
man .
i hope you got a lot of money for that game you threw , because that was the most pathetic thing i ever saw .
now , step out of the vehicle , mr. crewe .
don' t you think i should pull the car over more ?
i could get sideswiped .
you' re slurring your words a bit there , paul .
you been drinking tonight ?
absolutely not .
now , could you do me a favor ?
hold this beer while i back it up .
hey , you can finish that one .
i got five more .
take care , guys .
we got a 3 94 in progress .
okay , remain calm .
how you doing ?
what' s up ?
what' s up ?
what' s up ?
what you are watching is live footage of a vehicle , apparently stolen , being pursued by police .
we' re receiving word now that the driver of that vehicle is former pittsburgh football star paul crewe .
crewe , you might remember , was the only man ever to be indicted on federal racketeering charges for shaving points in a professional football game , although it was never fully proven .
yeah !
hello .
do not get one more scratch on my car , or i will slit your throat .
see , that' s our problem , sweetie .
you care about this car more than you do us .
and how' d you even know there was a scratch on this baby ?
because i am watching you on tv , as is the whole country .
once again , you are proving to everyone what a worthless piece of shit you are .
well , i hope they like this .
hey , lena !
i think we should start seeing other people !
i think i' m in love .
good news , boys , i didn' t spill my beer .
without question , crewe' s five year federal probation for point shaving has been severely violated tonight .
the future of this once great football star looks very dark indeed .
long way from the big city , huh , superstar ?
staying with the times around here , huh ?
ain' t she beautiful ?
home sweet home , boy .
get on your feet .
you' re one lucky son of a bitch , crewe .
is that right ?
that' s right .
see , the warden loves his football .
fact , he was on the winning side of your little thing .
well , tell him congratulations .
but i wasn' t .
welcome to allenville .
thank you , sergeant .
i' il take it from here .
afternoon , inmate crewe .
yeah .
come on .
warden wants to see you .
let' s do it .
move it .
i used to play a little college ball myself .
down at the university of miami .
i bet a lot of your old teammates are locked up in here .
no inmates from my playing days .
couple of guards , though .
see , we got us a fine prison guard league down here .
it' s like a company softball team .
now , the warden ... ... he' s gonna ask you to help out .
okay .
with what ?
that wasn' t nice .
when the warden asks you , what are you gonna say ?
yes ?
you' re gonna tell him " no .
you got it ?
you' re gonna tell the warden that you want nothing to do with his football fantasies .
not in my back yard .
because the warden don' t run this prison .
i do .
you understand ?
not entirely .
okay .
i feel you , dog .
i feel you .
paul " wrecking " crewe .
i don' t get to say this to my new guests very often , but it' s an honor to have you here at this institution .
it' s an honor to be locked up here , sir .
oh , well , this is errol dandridge .
colonel sanders been eating his own chicken .
he' s my political adviser .
see , i' ve been approached by several very influential people wondering if i' d be interested in standing for governor .
they see the way i run this prison , think maybe i should run this state .
only with less sodomy , right ?
hopefully none .
sorry .
now , there are two things we take very seriously here in the state of texas .
prison and football .
we play a little of the latter here .
the warden is too modest to admit that his team is rather good .
but not good enough .
five years since our last championship .
five years .
now , i' ve worked real hard , pulled strings , called in quite a few favors to get you here , paul .
now , why would you go and do that ?
because i am convinced that you can get us back on track .
i haven' t played football in i don' t know how long .
i don' t really want to .
you wouldn' t be playing , paul .
just consulting .
anyone who was once the mvp of the national football league must have a great deal of expertise to offer .
captain , what would you say to mr. crewe looking in , giving us the benefit of his experience ?
i think that' s a real good idea , warden .
we can use all the help we can get .
well , then , it' s all settled .
what you say , paul ?
i appreciate the offer , but i' m gonna have to pass .
now , i can assure you that your time here will be a whole lot easier if you just participate .
i just wanna do my time and go home .
nothing else .
if you' il excuse us , mr. crewe .
captain knauer , you can stay .
sit down !
i used to love your underwear commercials .
thank you very much .
my ex husband wore the same brand of tighty whities .
he didn' t fill them out quite as well as you , though .
special effects .
hollywood .
not all me .
oh , i doubt that very seriously .
well , then get him enthusiastic , damn it !
come on , get up .
how' d it go in there ?
we all set now ?
oh , yeah , we' re real tight .
only the finest for you , superstar .
i was just playing .
i ain' t gonna forget you , crewe .
hey , yo , you owe me money on that game , punk !
better watch yourself , mr. football !
bitch !
yeah , you better run , woman .
yo , football .
take a seat .
thanks .
you know , i have never seen one inmate just walk in here and be unanimously hated by the entire population .
i ain' t never seen it .
how' d i get so lucky ?
you could have robbed banks , sold crack , stole your grandmama' s pension , and nobody would have cared .
but shaving points off a football game ?
man , that' s just un american .
you play football ?
me ?
no .
i suck so bad , they used to pick me after the white kids .
used to be mad too .
it' s like , " i can' t believe i picked a nigga that can' t play .
caretaker .
paul crewe .
whatever your pleasure , i can facilitate .
you need weed , you need meth ...
hey , you need prozac , i' m your man .
i know how you white boys always deal with that depression .
i mean , me personally , i don' t understand what you white boys all depressed about .
hey , you' re white .
smile .
and for a small fee , i can even get you mcdonald' s .
really ?
yeah , that' s right .
mickey d' s .
my man cheeseburger eddy got the hookup .
cheeseburger eddy ?
that' s right .
we can get our mcflurry on .
enjoy it , fat man .
what about the love of a beautiful woman ?
well , you' re gonna have to lower your standards on the beautiful part and on the woman part .
hey .
let' s just stick with the cheeseburgers .
oh , they ugly now , but in eight months , he gonna look like beyonc .
no , thanks .
now , here' s the most important part .
you can' t let these guys scare you .
you can' t let them punk you .
because if you do that , you gonna end up being somebody' s bitch .
don' t want that .
thanks for the advice .
hey .
let me take that tray out for you .
i ain' t done eating yet .
oh , you' re not ?
i' il give it back to you , then .
you' re dead !
hornet' s nest !
everybody stay down .
stay quiet !
come on , crewe , get up .
get up , superstar .
yes , sir .
you think you can do anything you want around here , don' t you ?
well , you are no different than any other piece of shit that calls this place home .
really ?
these guys think you' re a dumb redneck too ?
girl , that' s your new boo .
you better cut that shit out .
it' s getting old .
that' s gonna cost you .
looking forward to it .
wake up , sleeping beauty .
hey , superdick .
warden' s wondering if your stay in the hotbox has changed your mind .
how long have i been in here ?
one week .
wanna go for two ?
how' d you find these guys anyways ?
recruitment , boy .
when college stars don' t get drafted , they need a place to go .
a job , money , security .
who drank all the damn gatorade ? !
damn it !
and apparently steroids .
look , seems like you got all the talent you' d want .
so why do you need me ?
well , now , you might find this hard to believe , but there' s folks here in the prison league don' t care for me very much .
you , warden ?
they thought it might be amusing to schedule the defending league champs as our first game .
and me ?
well , i thought an old pro like yourself might have some training camp tricks , drills , insights to offer up .
give us the competitive edge .
all right .
relatively simple .
you need a tune up game .
a tune up game ?
yeah .
in college , we' d start every season against appalachian state or some slack division ii team .
kick the living shit out of them .
get their confidence up .
you know something , paul ?
you' ve just given me an inspiration .
that' s great .
what ?
you' re gonna assemble a team to play the first game against us .
and you , mr. crewe , are gonna be the quarterback .
i don' t think so .
let me tell you something .
in my prison , to get along , you gotta go along .
i just wanna do my three years and be done .
three years is before you assaulted captain knauer .
now , you could be with us for a very long time , mr. crewe .
fine , i' il do it .
good choice .
but one condition , though .
gotta promise me to keep captain knauer off my back .
it' s a deal .
now , you got four weeks to assemble a team and train them .
what , are we gonna have a half hour a day to practice with a nerf ball ?
oh , i' il make sure my boys allow you sufficient freedom , within these walls , to get your team in shape .
what' s this ?
football ' tree outs . " '
what the hell is a " tree out " ?
tryout , " you half a meatball .
what' s this football thing about , man ?
crewe' s getting a team together .
to play against who ?
the guards .
now , i don' t know about y' all , but i occasionally have the impulse to physically assault one of our finer correctional officers .
yeah ?
well , how the hell we gonna get to do that ?
just show up at the " tree outs , " you big , dumb bitch .
do the girls get to play ?
we' re playing footballs , not balls balls .
this is bullshit .
just another chance for the guards to beat on us .
don' t you idiots get it ?
we could get a free shot at the guards .
this is our turn .
we could beat up on them .
we could kill them .
kill them .
you know mvp sold his own teammates out .
what do you think he' s gonna do to you fools ?
and that' s the truth .
with some cheese on it .
there ain' t no meat loaf between these buns .
yo , man , that' s my flier , man !
i worked hard on it !
you see ?
he ran like a little bitch , right ?
you saw that , right ?
yo , team needs you .
team needs you .
you sh ...
you come to the tr ...
come to the tree outs .
crappy field , shit ass equipment ...
hey , man , at least we got some world class players over there .
forty five .
forty six .
forty seven .
he might make the team .
well , if we gotta cut him , you' re doing it .
forty nine .
fifty .
all right , man .
good job , man .
well , well , well .
you a football player ?
oh , no .
i never played no football , mister .
so , what happened ?
you read the flier , thought it looked like some fun ?
oh , i can' t read .
oh , don' t worry .
reading' s for rich people .
so you know , we' re putting together a football team .
love you to join .
will you teach me to football ?
sure we' il teach you to football .
won' t we , caretaker ?
hey , i' il teach you anything .
just don' t eat me .
okay .
down , shrek .
down !
okay , bring it in .
whoever' s trying out for the team , wake up .
can you give a brother a little hustle ?
very good .
for those of you who don' t know who i am , i' m paul crewe .
i' m gonna be your coach , your captain , your quarterback .
you haven' t played in years .
why can' t i be quarterback ?
you' re right .
let' s see what you got .
all right .
hit me , i' m open .
hike , hike !
hike !
that' s why .
now , sit down and shut up .
it slipped .
i just ate popcorn .
any of you gentlemen ever play football before ?
you did ?
where ?
kansas state .
are you shitting me ?
for coach snyder ?
kansas state prison .
now , i hear they have the softest mattresses out there .
yeah , they do .
not as soft as the ones at west texas mental institution .
really ?
let' s finish this conversation later .
for now , i wanna see what you got out there .
we' il grade them on a scale of one to ten .

i' il take care of the rest .

yep .

the blood of the guards is gonna flow like the rivers of ancient babylon .
that' s good news .
unger , you' re the man .
good job today .
you' re all starting to look really sharp out there .
yeah .
see you tomorrow .
we' re gonna suck .
yeah .
no doubt about it .
you look like you could use a little help .
no offense , my man , but you' re a little seasoned .
seasoned ?
i' m not asking to play .
i' il coach .
i' m nate scarborough .
nate scarborough ?
the heisman trophy winner from oklahoma ?
the inmate from cellblock d.
but about a hundred years ago , when i could run and gun , yeah , i was a sooner then .
i heard you were dead .
no , i ain' t dead .
i' ve been right here , rotting .
waiting for a chance to get back at those sadistic guards .
waiting .
for this .
well , coach , as you can see , we don' t exactly have the cream of the crop to work with here .
well , what are we gonna do ?
how are we gonna find players ?
how' d they get you to go to florida state ?
they recruited me .
i' il get the strippers .
well , now , lindsay , this isn' t about credit or congratulations .
this is about giving men who' ve made mistakes in their lives an opportunity to rise above themselves .
to move beyond the bars of containment .
say what ?
what i would do to you .
yeah .
nice boot , skin man .
hey , why does he get to be the kicker ?
i was all state , man .
let' s see what you got .
that' s why , you dumb ass .
just go do some laps .
i heard you boys needed to see me .
yeah .
i want you to meet skitchy .
hey , dog .
check that building over there .
they keep all the records in the basement .
he' s been here so long , he knows where everything is .
that ain' t necessarily a good thing , is it ?
i had a parole date in ' 86 .
but i got in a tussle with a guard and ...
one punch and it went away .
twenty extra years for one punch ?
well , unfortunately for him , the guard he punched just happens to be the warden now .
oh , shit .
warden hazen ?
oh , shit " is right .
fight in the yard .
send backup .
right on time .
let' s do it .
let' s do it .
ain' t you guys glad you got a black man for a friend ?
hell , yeah .
come on .
hazen has a rating system for every con .
what' s three stars ?
the more prone to violence that the inmate is , the more stars he gets .
five stars is the max .
i didn' t know that .
let' s see how many stars my maniacal ass got .
half a star ?
that' s gotta be a mistake .
check it again .
check it again .
you' re about as maniacal as a boxful of kittens .
come on , that' s not funny , man .
i' m gonna have to stab somebody or something .
get my rep up .
why don' t we have a maniacal pillow fight tonight .
that could get it up some .
yeah .
we can sell it to pay per view .
superstar versus half a star .
why don' t you shut up before i slit your throat and watch the dust come out .
come on , guys , we only got a couple minutes .
how about this guy ?
damn , this fool got the chair three times , ain' t died yet .
well , we may not have the most talented team , but we will definitely have the meanest .
what' s he doing that for ?
because he' s a freak .
hey , sasquatch !
someone' s here to see you !
not too smart on your part .
hey .
how' s the headbanging coming ?
you' re bleeding .
just so you know .
people have told me that you and i look a lot alike , so i wanted to see for myself .
i' m gonna take a piss .
you scared him away , dumbshit .
you' re kidding .
five star torres likes the view ?
no , just joy behar .
the good news is she can breast feed standing up .
that' s it .
where does she come up with this shit ?
i' m a star jones man myself .
i love that big bitch .
that was , like , the furthest thing .
i got married so young , so , i mean , they weren' t pressuring me , the society was pressuring me ...
mr. torres .

we' re playing the guards .

i just don' t want my players to know it .
your players ?
just when i thought i had you all figured out .
what does that mean ?
in the time you' ve been here , you haven' t made or received one telephone call .
you haven' t opened so much as a single shred of mail .
what do you give a damn about those slimeballs ?
you never cared about anybody in your entire life .

sergeant engleheart .

he thinks we' re gonna skip practice today , wait for the field to dry , make it up tomorrow .
you know what ?
who gives a shit ?
three days till game time .
we can handle it .
that old man flooding this field tells me something .
the guy is scared .
scared of you sick , degenerate convicts .

he should be .
because i got news for you guys .
we' re gonna win this thing .
did he say " win " ?
what' s it gonna be , boys ?
do we go back to our cells , call it a day ?
or do we get ourselves ready for the greatest ass kicking fiesta in the history of football ?
i' il leave it up to you guys .

you being a ex football player and all ,
i' m sure you got a lot of hot ass on the outside .
well , let' s not forget i wasn' t the most popular guy out there .
don' t give me that shit .
o. j. chopped his wife' s head off and still got some ass .

my mama taught me not to kiss and tell .

i got one more question to ask you .
okay .

why' d you shave those points ?
didn' t you read the papers ?
i' m innocent .
yeah .

what are you talking about ?
what' s going on ?
now i gotta relive this shit ?

i was showing a little wrestling move .
that' s all .
knock it off !
knock it off !
it' s time we took a look at what we came here to see before the guards come back .
the first film is the guards ' offense against texas southern .
now , as you can see , they' re running a standard wishbone .
so you' re telling me that these animals are watching our game films .
is that right ?
yes , sir , boss .
they got all last season .
seems to me that we ought to do something about this .
what do you want me to do ?
you' re the criminal .
be creative .
but on game day , if i so much as ...
what are you doing ?
i don' t know .
i' ve had hot flashes all shift , and now my nipples are killing me .
why are we talking about your nipples ?
we' re not .
just go do what you' re doing there .
guys .
i want crewe finished .
yes , sir .
you give me the inspiration , sir .
i got something for him .
hut !
everybody !
huddle up !

tomorrow , payback .
now , think about that for a second .
what time is it ?
game time !
what time is it ?
game time !
what time is it ?
game time !
tomorrow , 12 : 00 , the bus leaves .
don' t be late !
where the hell is caretaker ?
i don' t know .
a gift for you , mr. crewe .
how does he listen to that cracker shit ?
we' re here deep in the heart of toothless country , coming to you from a simple texas high school stadium that' s been retrofitted for the big event .
now , when my man travis tried to drag me out here , i said ,
what are you , brain dead from talking to too many raider fans ?
it' s not going to work .
but the fact of the matter is , this could shape up as an epic day .
hot dog vendors , high powered rifles , i love the combination .
