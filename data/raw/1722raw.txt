i [ sniffles ]
i took her to the clinic and they said it was something else .
what something else ?
i don' t know .
you have a child .
if you don' t give a damn about yourself , at least you have to care about her !

because you' re her mother !
gee .
what' s wrong , mags ?
are you a little pissed that maybe there is one thing ...
i can do better than you after all ?
what are you talking about ?

mommy hood .
maybe if you could have carried a kid , that piece of shit husband of yours wouldn' t have run out on you .
what was it , two miscarriages , three ?
why do you do this , jenna ?
i' m the only family you' ve got left .
i am the one that is in trouble here , okay ?
i came to you for a little help and all you can do is give me shit !
i made a mistake coming here .
i' m leaving .

i don' t know what i' m gonna do .
i' m gonna help you , but first you have to get off the drugs .

it' s okay .
hi .
hi .
you' re a psychiatric nurse , maggie .
you know the diagnosis as well as i do the arching back , the repetitive behavior and the attention deficit .
i used to think it was autism too , but i' m not so sure anymore .
it' s as if she' s listening to something we can' t hear or see .
it' s a difficult diagnosis to accept .
i know that .
but there are a wide range of degrees of autism .
cody may well be one of the lucky ones .
reading , writing , language skills .
she may even be able to express basic emotions .
she does .
i know she' s a little withdrawn , but she smiles and hugs me and kisses me just like any little girl .
there' s a special needs school in brooklyn pre through six .
they' ve had great results with kids like cody .
it' s catholic .
i don' t know whether that' s any problem for you .
no .
i was brought up a catholic .
just so it' s not too religious .
and later , if her condition gets more severe
i welcome you with open arms .
it gets better every time .
i' ve sponsored your appointment , because i feel you are the most able statesman in all freedonia .
that covers a lot of ground .
you cover a lot of ground yourself .
leave in a taxi .
if you can' t get a taxi , you can leave in a huff .
if that' s too soon , you can leave in a minute and a huff .
you haven' t stopped talking since i came here .
you must have been vaccinated with a phonograph needle .
what is it ?
cody !
cody !
cody , cody .
it' s okay , baby girl .
it' s okay , baby girl .
it' s all right .
it' s okay .

i' ve gotta be up early tomorrow .

i got a pretty busy week this week , but i' il i' il call you ... soon .
that would be nice .
don' t leave in a huff .

martin ?
martin casillas ?
yeah ?
martin , you remember me .
i' m a friend of your father' s .
you were at my house last year .
you' re six , aren' t you ?
yeah .
good .
you like dogs ?
sure .
well , i found a puppy and i bet he needs someone to take care of him .
oh , you' re probably too young to have a puppy .
no , i could take care of a dog .
yeah ?
excellent .
well , he' s right over here in my van .
wow .
can i have him ?
maybe .
we' re looking for a very special little boy , martin .
if you' re the one , you can have the puppy .
but first you have to pass a test .
like what ?
the boy that we' re looking for can do things that nobody else can do , sort of like magic tricks .
do you know any tricks , martin ?
i don' t know .
well , maybe we can help you find out .
bet you that puppy' s hungry .
voila !
here .
why don' t you see if he' il take that from you .
go on .
what' s the matter ?
it' s only garbage , honey .
come on .
hey .
hey !
it' s just little mice ,
like mickey mouse .
it' s no big deal .
the body of six year old tania riley , the fourth victim in a series of kidnap murders , was discovered last night near a residential area in queens .
a statewide search is now in progress for the killer .
police have yet to name a suspect ... and have opened a 24 hour hot line for any information ... regarding this or any of the other murders .
hey .
hey , hey .
let' s put the dolly in the car .
hi , maria .
i' m really late .
i' ve gotta run to work .
okay .
it' s bedtime , mi angelito .

for teddy .
oh , okay .
but just for teddy .
your mommy' s very pretty , yes ?

i' m sorry , corazon .
i' m sorry , corazon .
you pray .
you see .
who knows , okay ?
buenasnoches , mi angelito .
buenas noches , mi angelito .
again , our guest today , eric stark .
you probably remember him as little luke , the child star of family days .
today he' s here to talk about his work as founder of the new dawn , one of the fastest growing self help organizations in america .
honey , you have five minutes .
then you have to go get dressed . ... an addict by 15 .
there were even rumors at one point that you had died from an overdose .
but now you' re helping these runaway kids .
you' re helping the abused kids .
you' re getting them off the streets .
you' re getting them off drugs and into your rehab centers .
what' s your secret ?
these kids are tortured with morality .
they feel terribly guilty and they want to forget .
so what we try to do at new dawn ... is teach these kids to look inside themselves
that' s your guy .
i' m looking for detective bugatti .
yeah , that' s me .
agent travis ?
how you doing ?
welcome to brooklyn .
i' il get you up to speed on all this stuff later .
but ... maybe it would be a good idea ... if you try to keep a low profile out here today .
why is that ?
well , some of the guys , they' re wound up pretty tight about this case .
they should be .
this is the fifth child and from what i heard , you still don' t have any suspects .
that' s true , but some of the detectives , they get a little territorial when the bureau steps in .
that would include you ?
hey , i don' t give a fuck if we gotta call in ... the french foreign legion if that' s what it takes to stop this guy .
mind if i take a look at the body ?
yeah , no , go ahead .
hi , cody .
hi .
those are very pretty .
who are they ?
must be that poor bird .
it flew into a window and broke its neck .
they' re all quite curious about death .
do you think they understand death ?
you' d be surprised .
i blame the lion king .
sister rosa , would you mind ?
cody fixed the bird !
cody fixed the bird !
maybe he was just knocked out when he hit the window .
no , he was dead .
cody fixed the bird !
cody fixed the bird !
i' m tired , mim .
okay , sweetie .
we' il go home .
thanks for staying .
sure .
must be a full moon tonight .
helen got cut by a paranoid " schiz " with a razor blade .
and there' s a biter in four .
terrific .
and a recovering o. d. in three seeing snow lights .
if you' il take the histories .
no problem .
thanks .
cheri post ?
who are you ?
i' m maggie .
wanna tell me what' s wrong ?
what do you think is wrong ?
i' m sketching , you know , coming down .
wanna lie down for me ?
your name is o' connor ?
mm hmm .
i don' t care about your tracks .
i want to help you .
i just need a blood sample .
some friends shot me up .
wanted me to end up in the morgue instead of here .
why would they do that ?
they don' t like people quitting their club .
nice club .
just relax .
you' re really nice for a nurse .
okay .
put some pressure on that .
you kind of look like her .
who ?
make it good .
i need a boost .
jenna .
my sister .
you know my sister ?
no , a friend of mine, janet .
no , no , no .
you said jenna .
where is she ?
i don' t
i haven' t seen her in six years .
i' ve looked for her everywhere .
she has a little girl she hasn' t even seen .
i know she has a little girl .
she' s special .
you know that , don' t you ?
that' s why they want her .
please tell me where my sister is .
forget about your sister , okay ?
they' ve already got her .
don' t let them get the little girl .
maggie , i need you in four .
doctor  right now !
stay here .
task force hot line .
can i help you ?
please , ma' am , slow down .
what makes you think that your landlord is the killer ?
crawford , i hate to break it to you , but that weed' s been dead for at least two weeks .
excuse me .
what is that ?
it' s a lily .
really .
yeah , it just needs a little sun , and you get sun through both windows .
i hope you don' t mind .
my daughter gave it to me .
no , it' s okay .
good .
don' t let crawford bug you .
he' s a little soft around the edges , but he' s a good cop .
oh , leave that there .
it' s all right .
a little ambiance .
can i ask you a personal question ?
depends on the question .
there' s a rumor going around that before you were in the bureau , that you were some kind of priest or something .
i was a seminary student .
i didn' t make it as far as the priesthood .
still , that is some kind of makeover .
what happened ?
found another way to fight him .
you ready ?
yeah .
fight who ?
gentlemen , ladies .
listen up , please .
most of you have met special agent john travis .
for those who haven' t , he' s on loan to us ... from the fbi behavioral sciences division at quantico .
agent travis' s area of expertise is ritual homicide ... and occult related crime .
he was instrumental in breaking the santeria case last summer .
no offense , but didn' t that case just end in an acquittal ?
that' s right .
the problem with prosecuting occult crime ... is the judicial concept of reasonable doubt .
the motives can be so bizarre , so far beyond reason , that they' re hard for a jury to accept .
that means we have to work twice as hard to get a conviction .
but our perp could just be some run of the mill psycho ... who gets his stuff off the back of a comic book .
i don' t think so .
whoever did this has a background in classic occult mysticism .
this symbol was used in ceremonial sacrifice ... as far back as 16th century europe .
the tines on the trident point left , signifying the left hand path of satanists .
it was a sign of a sect of luciferians ... who took the fallen angel mythology literally .
then you think the perp' s got motives ...
besides thrill kills ?
yes .
the crimes were meant to be against god , not men .
but all i can give you right now is a time frame .
all of the victims ' bodies also had these symbols ... branded on them pascua negra .
the translation would be " black easter .
whatever our man is up to will happen on easter eve .
that' s only about a week away .
maybe this is almost over .
or maybe in our perp' s mind that' s when it really begins .
no , last night .
i had just taken a blood sample when she ran off .
how could her paperwork disappear ?
i just need her name .
all right , thanks .
mim !
mim !
mim !
mim !
mim !
cody .
cody .
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
bad dream .
yeah , me too .
me too .
you try to go to sleep , okay ?
okay ?
buenas noches , mi angelito .
i think i' il take cody shopping today .
it' s so beautiful outside .
okay .
i' il just finish this and go home .
maria , are you missing your rosary ?
no .
why ?
because i found it under cody' s pillow last night .
oh , she asked me for it .
it makes her feel better .
i have an extra one if you want it .
no , thank you .
i' il bring it for you just in case .
cody , you ready to go shopping with your mim ?
what ?
is that maria' s church ?
yes .
can we go ?
okay , let' s go .
i' m going to say a little prayer , like maria does , okay ?
cody ?
she' s sad , mim .
so sad .
she' s crying for us .
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
nice limo you got there .
you won the lottery ?
miss o' connor ?
yes .
honey .
hello , mags .
hi , cody .
do you have a kiss for mommy , hmm ?
come here .
i' m eric stark , maggie ,
jenna' s husband .
we just got back from barbados last week .
part honeymoon , part healing process for jenna .
and no more bad habits
except for spending eric' s money .
mm hmm .
he saved my life .
are you a doctor ?
he' s eric stark , maggie .
the new dawn , the foundation , the seminars .
did you meet jenna through your work , mr. stark ?
eric , please .
yeah , we met at one of my outreach centers .
when was it , only last month ?
isn' t that amazing ?
crazy .
so this is all happening very quickly .
oh , yeah .
i don' t waste time anymore .
i wasted half my life on drugs .
that was enough .
no more .
no more presents .
um .
there' s still something wrong with her , isn' t there ?
i was hoped she would outgrow this .
she' s fine .
just a little different .
and she certainly isn' t deaf .
you know , i' m a little bit in a state of shock here .
you must know , eric , that i haven' t seen my sister ... since the first week cody was born .
well , i' m here now , and i' m healthy .
and everything' s going to be fine , isn' t it , sweetie ?
we' il get you well .
do you have a kiss for mommy , hmm ?
no .
she has to get used to you .
that will take time .
mm hmm .
like round the clock time , huh ?
cody ?
well , that' s why we' re here .
you' re gonna come live with eric and me , cody .
we' re gonna take you home .
darling ?
why don' t you have dahnia come up from the limo ?
maybe cody would like to meet her .
we have a wonderful nanny .
cody , go in my room and watch cartoons , okay , sweetie ?
hi .
could you send dahnia up now ?
jenna , i don' t think you understand .
cody' s very special .
you just said she was fine .
yes , but she probably has a form of autism .
i want the right people to see her .
she' s with the right people .
it' s taken a lot of work to bring her to this point .
a change could undo everything .
mags , eric and i talked about this .
she' s my daughter .
and it' s sort of like
it' s not really up to you .
who do you think raised her when you left her like a piece of luggage ?
who paid for her doctors and her schools and her test ?
that gives me some say what happens to her .
of course it does , maggie .
we' re grateful that you took care of cody when jenna wasn' t able to , but now she is .
and i have the money to give her ... the kind of special care and schooling she needs .
now that you' re here , i want you both to be in her life .
she' s made so much progress , but what she needs right now ... are rules and stability and familiar faces . are rules and stability and familiar faces .
then the sooner she gets familiar with us , the better .
ah , dahnia .
this is dahnia , mags .
she' s wonderful with children .
hello , miss o' connor .
may i see the child ?
no , you can' t .
as you wish .
maggie , really there' s no reason to be so defensive .
we want you to be part of the family and visit cody regularly .
this is crazy .
it' s too soon .
i have to talk to cody .
no .
there' s nothing to talk about .
jenna , please .
well , i think this visit is over .
jenna , why don' t you wait in the car ?
maggie , i want you to think this through carefully .
jenna and i , we only want what' s best for cody .
you don' t know her yet .
she doesn' t know you .
this will take time .
i' m afraid you don' t have that luxury .
you' re gonna have to decide right now , today , how you' re going to deal with this .
and i promise you , you do not want this in some court' s hands ... for your own good and for cody' s .
good bye , maggie .
cody ?
cody ?
cody .
cody !
no !
he grabbed her out of my bedroom !
calm down .
no , i won' t calm down .
i won' t leave here until somebody helps me .
excuse me , miss .
how old is your child ?
six years old .
it' s her niece actually .
can i take a look at that ?
yeah .
anyway , the kid' s not really missing .
it' s a custody dispute .
we should probably give it to social services .
eric stark is involved in this ?
have you talked to this guy ?
no .
i tried .
his number is unlisted ... and the foundation just gave me the runaround .
want me to find a number on him ?
yeah , thanks .
i' d like to talk to miss o' connor for a few minutes .
please , come this way .
i' il be honest with you , miss o' connor ,
stark' s organization has been under investigation before .
for what ?
harboring runaways .
there were allegations of tax fraud ... and money laundering , but nothing that would stick .
please , sit down .
see , stark is well protected politically ... and he keeps a pack of high priced lawyers in attack mode year round .
are you saying you' re scared of him ?
all i' m saying is that he' il bury you ... if you come after him without grounds .
are those the serial murders ?
i' m advising a task force here that' s handling that investigation .
but you don' t think this has anything to do with
no , but i do think ... that what my charmless colleague told you before is probably true .
right now the best thing for you to do ... is try to establish some form of legal custody .
you need a lawyer , not a cop .
so that' s it ?
get a lawyer " ?
that' s all the help you have to offer me ?
no , you have my word .
i will follow up on stark .
it' il be my pleasure .
i think his whole outfit stinks .
but i want you to promise me if you reach him first
i would just feel better if you give me a call ... before you even talk to this guy .
that will be my first priority , agent , making you feel better .
miss o' connor .
miss o' connor .
the only thing i can get on stark is the number for his lawyer .
no , thanks .
i want to follow up on this one .
yeah , right .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
come on .
the one lead you' re gonna follow up on ... is attached to a piece of tail like that ?
no wonder this priest thing didn' t work out .
this may be the best lead we' ve got .
take a look , frank .
december 16 , 1993 .
the same birthday as every kid on that board .
may i help you ?
i really don' t know much about your program and
would you like a tour ?
our main focus has been our national youth crusade , but our programs ... for adults have been gaining more and more popularity .
our self realization seminars only require a $400 donation .
what i' m really interested in is speaking with eric stark .
his schedule doesn' t allow for personal interviews , but i' il take you to our computer lounge ... and you can e mail him directly .
before i found new dawn , i didn' t have any respect for myself .
i didn' t think i mattered to anybody .
and eric helped me learn to will what i do ... and to stop letting others judge me .
eric helps you tap into this power .
i mean , he changed my whole life .
maggie , this is cheri post .
i got your number from the hospital .
i know where the kid is .
meet me at the diner at stanton and essex at midnight .
do me a favor .
bring some cash , okay ?
this is all you brought ?
i can' t get out of the city on this .
cheri , where is she ?
literally ?
of course not .
well , eric does and so do the sick fucks that are in with him .
so would you if you' d seen what i' ve seen .
like what ?
eric' s got this religion , only it' s more like the opposite of religion .
i thought it was all bullshit at first , but i' ve seen it work .
they can predict the future , even make things happen to people , bad things .
what does this have to do with cody ?
about a year ago , they all started acting a lot weirder than usual .
they started hunting down kids six year old kids , boys , girls .
but they all had to be born on this certain date .
they' d take each kid and put them through this test , and if they failed , they' d kill them .
the slaughter of the innocents , " they called it .
only cody isn' t like the other ones .
she' s the one they' ve been looking for all along .
so instead of killing her , eric' s gonna try to change her to make her just like him .
see ?
so he can use her power .
she' s just a little girl .
she' s more than that , at least she' s gonna be .
gonna be what ?
i don' t know .
a saint , a prophet .
she' s gonna lead people to god , maggie a lot of people only eric won' t let that happen .
if he can' t turn her , he' il kill her .
cheri , where is she ?
do you promise to get her out of there ?
yes .
you' re gonna need this .
hello .
hello ?
cheri .
come in .
crazy people like an audience .
is that a self diagnosis ?
no , just a popular theory .
i had a half a dozen transit cops here this morning .
they think the concussion makes me a less than credible witness .
they' re having a hard time believing you because they didn' t find a body .
you lied to me .
excuse me ?
you think what' s happened to cody is connected with the murders .
how many children are dead ?
five , that we know of .
slaughter of the innocents .
does that ring a bell ?
where did you hear that ?
from the girl they killed .
what did she mean ?
well , it' s from the bible .
when the three wise men told king herod ... that the star over bethlehem ... was the sign that the son of god had been born ,
herod sent his soldiers to kill all of the children ... that were born on that date .
but then an angel appeared before mary and joseph ... and warned them to escape .
and what date are our innocents born on ?
december 16 , ' 93 .
you son of a bitch .
it' s different with cody .
you should have told me !
it' s different with cody .
we know who took her .
and you haven' t done anything about it .
have you even found where he' s keeping her ?
maggie , his organization owns ... dozens of different properties all around the country .
he lives like a textbook paranoid .
he keeps moving all the time .
you could put out a warrant .
come on , maggie .
you don' t think i want this guy ?
i do .
but if i make a move without grounds , it' il blow the whole case .
and there won' t be a second chance here not for you , not for cody .
that' s a composite that we got of the killer ... from two very strong eyewitnesses .
do you recognize him ?
no .
but eric could still be involved .
yeah , it' s possible .
how many children have been killed since cody disappeared ?
none .
i' m going to help you , maggie .
i' m gonna make a request to have an officer outside the door ...
for the next couple of days , okay ?
okay .
there is one other thing .
the hospital said that they found this on you .
those kids tried to kill me last night .
i wish i had used it .
well , you didn' t get that from me .
lord , i could use a little help here .
oh , sorry .
you all alone in here ?
yeah .
look , if i' m disturbing you
no , that' s okay .
i' m done for tonight .
oh , man .
i don' t know how you do this .
what ?
this kind of work .
day after day .
it' s gotta wear down a man' s spirit .
the worst thing is knowing that he' s still out there .
and we' re running out of time .
you' il catch him .
i got a good feeling about this .
you do , huh ?
you' re wrong about one thing though .
what' s that ?
you' re not working alone tonight .
a good man is never alone in this world .
i' m sorry .
can' t you tell me who she is ?
hey , how about watching my car ?
hello ?
jenna , it' s maggie .
maggie , if eric finds you here
do you have any idea who this man is ?
maggie , i' m begging you .
cody .
cody .
cody , hi .
hi !
cody miss mim .
i missed you .
are you all right ?
cody go to dentist tomorrow .
tell ' em don' t make cody go to dentist .
no .
how would you like to get up right now and leave ?
what do you think you' re doing ?
i' m taking cody .
and i want you to come with us .
no .
no , maggie .
no .
maggie , i' ve watched him with her .
he' s very gentle .
maggie .
what a surprise .
you should' ve called .
unfortunately , it' s almost time for cody' s nap .
come here , cody .
sit down , maggie .
it' s all right , jenna .
it' s okay .
actually , uh ,
i' m a little tired myself .
no !
stay .
we' il have drinks .
stuart !
stuart !
i think maggie' d like a drink .
oh unless you have to run .
no .
i' il stay .
i don' t care for a drink .
i' ve been trying to reach you for the last couple of days , and i really don' t understand why
there are certain forces in this country , maggie , that don' t want me empowering the younger generation .
i have to protect my privacy and my family any way i can .
well , the reason i dropped by is , um , they' re having an easter egg hunt at cody' s old school .
and i thought it would be really fun if we went .
why don' t you run get your coat ?
actually , maggie , things have changed since last time we spoke .
originally , we' d hoped some kind of visitation might be worked out , but your attitude has made that impossible .
i knew you wouldn' t give her up ... without getting something in return .
you have nothing i want .
how about my silence ?
go on .
i' m no fool , eric .
i didn' t imagine what happened to cheri .
i know she' s dead .
no one' s saying you' re a fool .
it' s just obvious you' re not well .
so , i' m scared .
you' ve accomplished that .
but i' m not likely to make a deal and break it the way she did , am i ?
you let me take cody and jenna and leave right now , and that' s it it' s over .
you can go on with your mission or your religion ... or whatever it is , and you' il never hear from us again .
maggie , i' m not leaving .
there' s nothing bad going on here .
we are taking very good care of cody .
eric gives her everything she needs .
he married you to get to her .
you are jealous .
you are jealous because i finally have a family and you don' t !
maggie , this is exactly why i didn' t want you here .
dahnia , take cody upstairs !
i' ve never fired a gun before , but i' il bet at this range i' m dead on .
don' t !
are you really gonna shoot me , maggie ?
right here , in front of cody ?
close your eyes , sweetheart .
go ahead and fire , maggie .
feel that hate .
feel it ?
feels good , doesn' t it ?
something that feels that good ... can' t be wrong .
oh , my god .
oh
thou ... shalt ... not ... kill .
especially without bullets .
i know .
you' re confused , aren' t you ?
concussions are tricky , huh ?
they can mess with your perceptions .
police start saying you' re seeing things .
maybe you are .
oh .
here .
oh .
here .
i wouldn' t want you to hurt yourself .
you know what ?
on second thought ,
i think i will take your silence after all .
mim !
mim !
you' ve got to get out .
take my hand .
agent travis .
it' s maggie .
what the hell happened to you ?
we thought you were dead .
we' ve got witnesses that saw your car go into the river .
someone helped me .
no one saw that ?
i guess not .
and lucky for you .
if the cops found you at the scene , you' d be in a cell right now .
there' d be a warrant out for hit and run ...
if they knew you were alive .
it was stark and his people .
i went there to get cody .
you what ?
how did you manage  they drugged me .
i don' t know how , but i woke up right before the crash .
you do believe me , don' t you ?
maggie , i want you to turn yourself in to me .
at least you' il be safe until we can build a case against stark .
you gotta trust me right now .
trust me .
you want me to be safe ?
yes , i do .
then don' t tell anybody i' m alive .
maggie , don' t don' t  [ dial tone ]
cody ?
come on .
you' re not like ordinary children , cody .
do you know that ?
on the night you were born ... a star appeared in the sky ... pointed right down at you .
a star that hadn' t been seen in 2, 000 years .
like baby jesus ?
you' re such a smart girl .
do you love god , cody ?
yes .
well , maybe that' s just ' cause you think you' re supposed to .
i' m gonna teach you something tonight .
something i think you' re smart enough to understand .
no . no .
no , no .
shoo .
uh uh .
sh
look at this man .
he should be in an institution .
no , no .
no , no .
shoo .
uh uh .
go away !
but god abandoned him , didn' t he ?
left him here to suffer .
death ... would be a kinder fate .
shoo shoo !
even a cruel death .
through the power of the one i serve ,
i can give him the strength to end his pain .
watch .
if god loves his children so much , maybe he' il stop this .
redeem him ... somehow .
or maybe ...
or maybe ... the release i' ve offered him ... is his only true salvation .
eric !
he has forgotten you .
th thank you .
she will be ours .
dear god , if you really are there , please help me .
please help me and cody .
i know what' s happening to you .
there' s a man who can help us .
please , we don' t have much time .
unhh !
mommy' s busy right now , sweetheart .
why don' t we go have a ...
little talk .
just you and me .
think it' s time for another lesson .
i assure you , father grissom understands what you' re up against .
he was a jesuit priest , a scholar who was censured by the vatican .
the devil' s greatest achievement ... is that people don' t believe he exists .
nowadays the concept of evil is politically incorrect .
then how could someone actually recruit people to worship the devil ?
only a secret inner circle practice traditional satanism .
but eric stark and other groups like his ... are spreading a powerful message
god does not really exist .
therefore , we can all make up our own rules .
come with me .
i' ve got something to show you .
these visions that you' ve seen ... have all been seen by others throughout the centuries .
accounts of demonic attack are common ... in all cultures and religions .
there , you see ?
there' s a spiritual battle going on in this world .
we' re all part of it every day of our lives .
from what sister rosa has told me ,
i believe that cody will be an important part of this battle .
i have seen the glory of god in her , maggie .
i know you have too .
what will eric do with her ?
all these things will i give thee , if thou wilt fall down and worship me .
satan' s temptation of christ .
he' il try to turn her to his side , maggie .
if he can' t , he' il destroy her .
what do i do ?
get her back whatever way you can .
i i can' t go back to eric' s place .
does she never leave ?
they' re taking her to the dentist tomorrow .
then , that' s our chance !
john will go with you .
i' ve helped families get their kids out of new dawn before .
we won' t make a move unless we' re sure she won' t be hurt .
these are directions to our convent in vermont .
i' il be waiting for you .
i don' t know if i can do this .
yes , you can , maggie .
there is hope .
you must believe that .
not just for cody .
all of us are chosen by god , and all of us can stand against the darkness in his light .
i never brought any of the other children up here , cody .
just you .
you know why ?
no .
' cause i' m your father now , cody .
you never had a father before , did you ?
no .
look .
pretty , isn' t it ?
all this , as far as the eye can see , is just a small part of what can be yours , cody , if you' re a good daughter ... and you do what i say . and you do what i say .
but you have to choose ... soon .
this only works if it comes from your heart .
what does god offer that compares ?
does he even exist ?
maybe god' s just a nice idea
like the easter bunny .
he' s not real ... is he ?
i know how you can tell .
in the bible , my lord says ,
if thou be the child of god , cast thee down from hence .
for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee ... and in their hands they shall bear thee up .
jump , cody .
jump .
if you believe in god , jump .
if not , you come to me .
what do you believe in , cody ?
my hand ?
huh ?
it' s here .
you can see it .
satan rules it , and it will protect you always .
or his hand ?
is it there ?
huh ?
or isn' t it ?
will he catch you or not ?
if you believe , cody , [ panting ]
jump !
jump !
after you .
ahh !
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry , darling .
come on .
let' s get you back inside .
bugatti , homicide .
agent travis .
travis i heard of you .
none of your voodoo stuff here .
just some bum got torched .
hey , frank .
how are you doing ?
it' s a druid rune spell .
straight out of the 16th century .
think we know how it started .
how long will it take your forensics lab to get prints off of that ?
mm , call in a favor , a couple of hours , maybe .
we' re out of time on this , frank .
it' s easter eve .
we have stark' s prints on file from a drug bust ing82 .
if they match
if they match , i' il get you a warrant ... on this devil loving bastard before lunch .
hold it .
there they are .
no , it' s fine .
sure .
yeah , tomorrow at 5 : 00 , okay ?
yeah .
no , i' m sure we can fit you in .
okay ?
have a good afternoon .
bye .
yes ?
thank you .
mim !
we' re just about done .
tell eric i' il have the new dental records ready by tonight .
thank you , doctor .
that' s a relief .
wait a minute !
maggie , i was getting worried .
ohh !
wait !
stop that woman !
oh .
run , cody !
run !
after you .
thank you .
eric stark , this is the police !
we have a warrant to search the premises !
where we going , mim ?
vermont , to see sister rosa .
she has some friends there .
kids ?
like at school ?
we' il see .
looks like he blew town .
we' ve gotta strip this place down to the floorboards ... until we find a lead on him .
the little girl' s only got a few hours left .
you got anything ?
not yet .
we have access , but his files are encrypted .
we need anything on property that he owns , places he might be staying .
just a whole lot of nothing .
mm hmm .
not even dust .
paint' s fresh .
does your forensics team have an a. l. s. ?
yeah , they got all those toys .
we' re gonna need it .
oh , thank you .
buenos dias .
hi .
you' re sick .
oh , i' m so sorry .
out of the mouths of babes , huh ?
go !
what the hell are you doing ?
officer , you don' t understand .
give me your keys , now !
they' re trying to kill us .
license and registration .
we' ve got to get out of here !
run !
run , baby , run !
go !
go !
looks like your boy' s got serious money stashed in the caymans .
the i. r. s. might be able to make a case .
what about property ?
he owns some kind of country estate north of the city .
i need an address on that .
working on it .
okay .
we' re all set .
lights , please .
try over here .
oh , my god .
think your guys can pull dna off of that ?
yes , sir .
need to run a match against the kids .
yeah .
yeah .
lights , please .
how long is it gonna take you ...
to get those crates analyzed ?
hello .
agent travis , it' s maggie .
they' ve got cody .
where are you ?
i' m at a diner on route 17 ...
about 30 miles south of albany do not move .
don' t talk to anyone .
i' il be there as soon as i can , okay ?
okay .
agent travis ?
got a location on that estate .
it' s just off 87
let me guess .
just outside of albany .
right .
it' il take a couple of hours to get there .
i' il call the state troopers .
i' il catch a lift from air support , and i' il meet you there .
i' m gonna need local backup .
you got it .
maggie !
are you all right ?
yes .
stark' s on the move .
our best guess is that he took cody ... to an old estate he owns just north of here .
we' re gonna get her back , though .
i promise you that .
you travis ?
yeah , that' s right .
the place is about a half an hour away from here .
local police have already done some reconnaissance .
how' s it look ?
the entrance is guarded .
oh , that' s no good .
the element of surprise is the key thing .
they might hurt the girl .
well , there used to be a dirt road about two miles up the interstate .
it' s probably overgrown .
could get us on the grounds .
all right , we' il rendezvous there .
no flashers .
no sirens .
no one goes in that property until my command !
ah !
the prodigal daughter returns !
just in time for her last supper .
it' s easter eve , sweetheart .
you only have a few hours left .
tonight you can be reborn through my lord , or die for yours .
you' re alone , cody .
and through me ... him .
now , this is the last time i' m going to ask you .
join us , cody .
join us ... if you want to live .
cody , do what he says .
please .
is that it ?
is that all you can do ?
dahnia , i don' t think cody' s hungry .
why don' t you prepare the light of the world for her big night .
has she called ?
still nothing .
mother superior is ready to lock up for the night .
they should' ve been here hours ago .
what do you want me to do ?
tell everyone to meet me in the chapel .
these people are under attack , sister .
they need our prayers .
that must be it .
i want you to stay in the car .
i need to be there for cody .
i' m serious , maggie .
where' s that backup ?
they were right behind us .
they' ve got to be right back there somewhere .
you wait for them at the turn off .
we' il stay here .
you look so beautiful , little one .
tonight is a very special night .
tonight ... you must make your mommy and new daddy ... proud .
thanks for waiting .
lights are on upstairs .
okay .
let me check .
maggie !
come on !
she' s getting away !
hey
you bastard !
it' s customary for guests to kneel .
cody !
for the girl cody , the innocent , that she may one day stand against the dragon ,
we pray to the lord .
lord , hear our prayer .
for maggie o' connor , that she will have faith in you , lord ,
grant her strength .
lord , hear our prayer .
send your angels to protect them , father .
send your angels to stand against the forces of darkness ... that would do them harm .
we pray to the lord .
lord , hear our prayer .
this is it , cody .
i know you like angels , don' t you ?
well , satan was an angel too the most beautiful angel of them all .
so beautiful ... that god gave him dominion over the earth .
no !
all you have to do ... is cry out to him .
ask him for mercy .
call his name .
say his name !
choose , cody .
choose satan as your god , or your beloved mim dies .
no !
don' t , cody .
don' t .
close your eyes .
we' re faraway from here .
we' re together .
we' il always be together .
what' s your choice ?
what' s your choice , cody ?
say it !
police !
open up !
kill the girl !
shoot her !
mim !
no !
i deliver you unto ... him .
drop !
maggie !
maggie !
are you hurt ?
keep your head down !
jenna !
come on , maggie !
was anybody else in there ?
so , are you going back to work at the hospital ?
if they' il have me .
how' s jenna doing in rehab ?
fine , so far .
she asked me to adopt cody .
no one will ever take her away from me again .
come on .
we' re gonna be late for the church bells .
we' re right on time .
you ready ?
ten , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one .
are you all right ?
it' s all right now .
