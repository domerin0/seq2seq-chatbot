i guess those extra help sessions didn' t quite do it for you .
let' s go , man .
this guy' s cool .
he' s the best teacher i ever had .
let' s go .
sorry about this , mr. duncan .
honest mistake .
<i>got things under control ? </ i>

<i> # happy birthday to you ! # </ i>
hey , kid !
you made me laugh .
so dorset prep , where is that exactly ?
mars .
oh , that' s hilarious .
it' s in the suburbs , a half hour away .
it' s a great offer , but paul hasn' t made up his mind yet .
i bet that' s a change from the school you teach at now .
oh yeah , less crack , better cafeteria selection .
don' t mind paul .
he' s still grappling with his conscience .
mom , dad , this is the coolest present ever !
oh ho , it looks good too , right ?
do you think he needs more sugar ?
yeah i know , i' m breaking every rule .
hello , is steggie in here ?
beware .
hey , cake for steggie .
he can' t eat that , it ...
why not ?
he' s an herbivore .
oh , oh , he' s an herbivore .
okay , then i' il just take it back .
wait , maybe leave it , just in case .
take it back .
that' s what i thought .
good night .
bye , dad .
good birthday ?
yeah .
all right .
good night , dad .
good night .
what was your favorite present ?
my jacket ...
yay ! ... you got me .
you look so good in red .
what' s on your agenda tomorrow ?
uh , i have to stop by the gallery .
i have to pick up a lens i ordered .
i have to get a new pair of sneakers for adam .
ooh , i have to do you .
i could take care of that right now .
have you thought about that job offer ?
you do realize it' d mean moving , right ?
so , we' d move .
you know we used to think we were pretty hip living down here .
i also used to think four merit lights and a diet coke constituted a meal .
honey , i love this place as much as you do , but we' ve got a kid to think about .
and i just don' t think any city is a great place to raise a kid these days .
plus , you' d be making twice what you' re making now .
i' m just not sure the timing' s right and your photography is starting to take .
this is not about my photography .
okay , i just can' t shake this feeling that somehow ...
i' d be selling out .
right .
listen ... you know how much i respect your ethics .
but this is about adam .
sometimes , ethics have to take a back seat .
<i>okay , your turn . </ i>
okay , i' m going to a picnic ...
yeah ?
and i' m going to bring an ant , a bagel , a croissant ,
a ding dong ...
like you ?
mom !
a ding dong ...
yeah ?
uh ...
shoe store , 3 : 00 !
yes !
take my hand .
i think if you pump them any more , they might explode .
really ?
kaboom !
do you want ' em or not ?
yeah .
do you want this ?
yeah .
i' m just gonna go test these outside , okay ?
okay , but don' t go too far , okay ?
and how would you like to pay for this ?
a credit card , please .
ma' am ?
i need your signature .
sorry , so sorry .
all right , sorry .
thanks .
great .
<i>hello ! </ i>
you guys !
where' s my greeting committee ?
jess ?
i' m sorry , i got stuck at a teacher' s conference .
jessie ?
you have four new messages .
paul , i ...
god damn it !
we' il handle all the funeral arrangements .
god be with you .
thank you for everything , father .
honey ?
excuse me , jessie ?
jessie duncan ?
yeah ?
it' s richard , richard wells .
richard ?
your wife was an undergraduate student of mine .
it' s been years .
actually , richard , it' s ... it' s kind of a bad time .
i know , i read about it in the paper .
i can' t tell you how sorry i am .
thank you .
actually , do you have a minute ?
i' m sorry , i know this is a terrible time .
i don' t think so .
not right now .
but believe me , if there was any other way ...
the truth is , i went to some trouble to find you .
i' d like to help you .
help us ?
i' m a doctor .
i specialize in fertility .
if we could just talk , it won' t take long , i promise you .
we can go to a restaurant right over there .
i finished the residency in ob gyn , but my real passion is research .
what is it you do , paul ?
i teach biology .
you do ?
can you tell us what this is about ?
yeah .
the truth is , there is ... there' s no easy way to present this to you , so i' m just gonna come out and say it .
my clinic has perfected a procedure by which a single cell could be used to create a genetically identical fetus ... a fetus which could be carried to term and , in effect , be reborn .
do you mean cloned ?
<i> yes . </ i>
yes .
yes .
this would be the identical boy down to the last chromosome on the last hair of his head .
this is how you wanna help us ?
i used to be affiliated with a hospital here and i had a chance to review jessie' s records .
you did what ?
i' m aware of the complications surrounding adam' s delivery , <i>that it' s impossible</ i> <i>for you to conceive again . </ i>
<i>you looked at her records ? </ i>
i had to be certain that jessie' s condition didn' t preclude carrying a child and it doesn' t , so yes , i can help you .
you can have him back , your son adam , to birth again , to raise .
adam' s dead , god damn it !
paul .
paul .
my son is dead !
paul , please .
you come at me with this ?
god knows what hell you' ve been through .
the last thing i want to do is make this time any harder .
but the truth is i can do this , and i want you to know .
what you' re talking about is illegal , not to mention potentially immoral .
illegal , yes .
immoral , no .
we' re talking about using life to create life , that' s all .
and you' ve done this before ?
you' ve successfully cloned a human being ?
no , i haven' t but only because i' ve been looking for an ideal candidate .
i read about what happened .
and i hope that if you two aren' t interested
in what i' m proposing here ...
what are you proposing here ?
he' s not even sure that he can ...
that' s not true ...
i am sure .
still , it does come down to trust .
you' d be ...
excuse me , your menus .
you' d be gambling on me as much as i' d be gambling on you .
my clinic is some 300 miles from here .
if you were to do this , it would mean moving there and i' il be honest with you , changing your lives entirely .
paul' s right , this is extremely against the law .
you' d have to sever all ties with family , with friends , with anyone who ever knew adam .
of course i would help with the relocation , and i can get you a job at the local high school .
you know what , i' ve heard enough .
paul , please .
i know how upsetting this is .
no , no , no , you don' t know !
you could never know .
<i> let' s go ! </ i>
<i> you' re right . </ i>
i' m sorry to have upset you .
jessie ...
jessie !
i can be reached at this number .
dna can be saved indefinitely ...
jessie !
but adam' s cells will only be viable another 72 hours .
so if you do change your mind ...
<i>practically a stranger . </ i>
<i>i can' t believe you' re considering this ! </ i>
i can' t believe you' re not considering this .
any idea how much could go wrong ?
honey , i ... listen , i love you , i love you .
i love you beyond words , okay ?
but only the tiniest thing has to go wrong and so much has to go right .
but what if it did ?
it still wouldn' t be adam .
it would be an identical twin .
it' d be like another kid .
but he' d have the same face and the same laugh .
in time , we can try again , i swear .
no , we can' t .
you know we can' t .
we' il find a way .
we can have ...
i don' t want another child !
i want adam !
i want him back .
you know what i kept thinking while i was waiting for paramedics ... and he was in my arms ... and i was watching him die ?
this is the last time i' il ever get to hold him .
my little boy .
hello .
<i>paul . </ i>
l ...
i just heard .
i' m so sorry .
<i>oh , yeah . </ i>
<i>thank you , sam . </ i>
um ... so ... how' s jessie taking all this ?
actually , she' s ... she' s not so well .
<i>right , of course . </ i>
look , would you please just pass on my condolences to her ?
yeah , i will .
hey , sam , can i ... can i ask you something ?
<i>have you ever heard</ i> <i>of a doctor named richard wells ? </ i>
richard wells .
sure i' ve heard of him .
why do you ask ?
he was an old teacher of jessie' s .
really ?
he' s the stuff of legend .
he was doing really advanced work on gene mapping .
we' re talking way ahead of his time .
anyway , last thing i heard , he sold his findings to a huge firm , made a ridiculous amount of money , and then just sort of dropped out of the game entirely .
<i>every once in a while i come across</ i> <i>an article of his in a journal, </ i> <i>consistently brilliant . </ i>
<i>like i said , he' s ... </ i>
a genius .
yeah , i know .
<i> paul , i' m so very sorry . </ i>
<i> okay , thanks . </ i>
<i>or you go like that . </ i>
<i>one ... </ i>
<i>oh , ooh ! </ i>
can' t you see this ?
<i>three , two , one . </ i>
<i>the game is live ! </ i>
<i>then all of a sudden ... </ i>
<i> i' m right side up ! </ i>
<i>wait a second, </ i> <i>you' re confusing me . </ i>
do you think that' s a good idea ?
no , i think we should call it adam .
<i>guess who ? </ i>
<i> i don' t know . </ i>
<i> it' s me , adam . </ i>
<i> i don' t think i know an adam . </ i>
<i> i' m your son . </ i>
<i>ow !
ow ! </ i>
<i> the family jewels . </ i>
<i>are we all in ? </ i>
<i>damn , what a handsome group . </ i>
<i> yep . </ i>
<i>hi , mom ! </ i>
<i> adam ! </ i>
hello ...
this hat .
i' ve never seen you wear this before .
bad hair day , i guess .
i' ve never seen you wear any hat .
<i>all cells are</ i> <i>in essence clones ... </ i> <i>identical copies</ i> <i>of one original cell . </ i>
<i>the key to artificially</ i> <i>stimulating replication</ i> <i>is in shocking a specialized cell</ i> <i>back to its pre specialized state ... </ i> <i>its stem cell precursor ... </ i>
<i>the cell as it was before it became</ i> <i>a liver cell or a brain cell, </ i> <i>or a relatively simpler</ i> <i>cheek cell . </ i>
<i>once in this state , the cell' s nucleus</ i> <i>is immediately transferred</ i> <i>to a mother' s</ i> <i>enucleated egg . </ i>

she did great .
we just need to keep her here until tomorrow to make sure the implant takes .
but she did wonderfully .
she has to lie down for at least an hour , so why don' t we go look at the house and i' il show you around ?
she' s in good hands .
so , all these people and no one else knows ?
the procedure doesn' t differ much from a standard implant .
so , as far as my staff' s concerned ,
jessie' s being treated as a high risk in vitro , nothing more .
dr. wells ?
thanks , george .
there you go .
riverton' s a great town , i think you' re really gonna like it here .
it' s a bit secluded maybe , but a wonderful community .
nice people , lots of families ... perfect place to raise a child .
so why don' t you follow me ?
i' il show you around .
<i>beautiful country , isn' t it ? </ i>
<i>this whole area</ i> <i>has a lot of history . </ i>
<i>and the house itself</ i> <i>is 100 years old at least . </ i>
sorry , there' s no furniture .
so i took the liberty of ordering some .
it should be here sometime tomorrow .
what if this didn' t work , richard ?
what if the implant doesn' t take , the procedure' s a bust ... what then ?
it' il work , paul .
you can' t say that with any certainty .
look , no one can say anything with any certainty .
i mean , even a routine pregnancy is fallible .
but if i can speak plainly , what more do you have to lose ?
her .
jessie .
she' s pinned every hope in the world on this .
and i won' t let her down , or you .
you have my word on that .
is this for real ?
for now .
i can' t believe this place .
hey .
look at this .
what is that ?
oh my god , paul .
you know what we could put down here ?
darkroom ?
how are you feeling ?
i' m okay .
jessie !
hon ?
i' m back .
i' m home to our ... big home !
hey !
hi .
you said we' d never have a party in here .
come on .
come on , come on , push it .
i can' t !
yes .
no , it hurts .
yes .
you' re doing fine , jessie .
you' re fully dilated , the head' s already crowning , you just need to now push .
something' s wrong .
<i> no , nothing is wrong . </ i>
something' s wrong , i' m telling you .
it' s coming out .
it' s fine .
you can see the head .
keep pushing .
push , push , push .
keep pushing , push .
good girl .
<i>come on , push , push , push . </ i>
<i> come on , come on . </ i>
oh , there we go , okay .
all right , all right , we' re out , we' re out .
that' s it .
it' s okay .
let me just hear you ...
let me just hear you scream .
you did great .
come on , come on .
that' s great , honey .
he' s all right .
it' s great .
i just need some breath from him .
he' s all right .
<i>okay , how long ? </ i>
<i>30 seconds , 31 , 32 ... </ i> <i>33 , 34 , 35 ... </ i>
36 , 37 ...
we' re gonna have to bag him .
38 , 39 ...
what' s wrong ?
<i> 40 seconds , 41 ... </ i>
<i> 40 ... </ i>
42 , 43 ...
come on , come on .
44 ...
oh , baby .
oh , baby , thank god .
this is the same as last time , remember ?
it' s him .
you wanted to give us a scare , didn' t you ?
oh , thank you , god .
thank you .
<i>thank you . </ i>
here you go , kiddo .
good night , adam .
my little boy .
i still think it' s a little strange .
huh uh .
it' s his name .
it' s always been his name ...
adam .
<i> # ...
birthday to you # </ i>
<i> # happy birthday to you # </ i>
<i> # happy birthday , dear adam # </ i>
<i> # happy birthday to you ! # </ i>
there you go , buddy .
uncle richard !
happy birthday , adam .
<i>cake , cake , cake ! </ i>
<i>cake time !
cake ! </ i>
so , how' s work going ?
it' s good .
it' s good ... nice kids , bright too .
i don' t know , sometimes i feel like i' m teaching fish to swim ... at a club med .
you don' t still miss your old school ?
no , it' s more like i miss missing it .
uncle richard , want to help me fly it ?
<i>let' s get it up there . </ i>
keep it away from the trees .
so what was this word you said ?
<i>reeservoier . </ i>
<i>it' s a science word , uncle richard . </ i>
we' ve been learning about natural resources in school .
oh , you mean a " reservoir .
well , that' s a lot like a lake , only it' s a man made lake .
but i thought god made everything .
well , in a way he did , if you believe he created those people who figured out how to make a reservoir , right ?
<i>bye , guys , thank you . </ i>
<i> see you later , adam ! </ i>
<i>thanks , paul , see you later . </ i>
<i> hey , kiddo ! </ i>
bye , adam !
why don' t you come on inside , say goodbye to your friends ?
<i>thank you , adam . </ i>
<i>bye , adam ! </ i>
bye .
bye , paul .
<i>adam ! </ i>
<i>bye ! </ i>
hey !
birthday boy !
how many times i gotta tell you , you can' t leave your toys around ?
somebody' s gonna trip and ...
for those of us who don' t wear helmets in the house ...
what you doing ?
where did you get this ?
it was a birthday present from joey smoyer .
<i>do you like it ? </ i>
yeah .
why don' t you get some sleep ?
dad , i' ve been thinking ...
about what ?
i don' t think i like you so much anymore .
no ...
gotcha !
ohh , somebody is in some very serious trouble .
where do you think you' re going ?
where do you think you' re going ?
i' m gonna smother you now .
stop it , dad !
it' s just in ... some ways , he' s so much the same , you know ?
but he' s still his own person entirely .
and then ...
iook at him .
i honestly forget sometimes , you know ?
and then something like that ... that toy dinosaur thing will happen .
it' s okay , it happens to me too .
i just worry , you know ?
what ?
if he ever found out .
he won' t find out .
what if he did ?
about what it would mean to him .
<i>i just love him so much . </ i>
both of you .
meow !
no !
no !
help !
<i> adam ! </ i>
adam !
it' s okay , i' m right here .
<i>who are you ? </ i>
dad !
adam !
<i> no . </ i>
mom !
adam ?
oh my god !
adam !
ow !
jesus , take it easy !
go away !
it' s okay , okay !
no !
it' s okay , take it easy .
stay away !
get away !
jessie !
it' s okay .
get away from me !
it' s okay !
okay , okay !
get off !
all right !
it' s okay .
get off me .
jessie !
honey ? !
ow !
oh , god !
adam ?
adam ?
what happened ?
i don' t know , he just collapsed .
call 911 !
i' m calling richard .
richard , thank god .
i want him in a hospital .
paul , my staff and i can handle this .
your staff don' t even know about this .
they don' t need to .
it' s the same as always ... we' re close friends .
you know our arrangement .
maybe we need to reconsider our arrangement .
it' s five hours , he' s still unconscious .
his respiration and color are good and he' s responding to low level stimuli .
he' s basically just sleeping .
except for some reason , he' s not waking up .
he seems to have night terrors .
night terrors ?
it' s a sleep disorder .
a child screams in his sleep .
he may sit up , walk , even talk , but all attempts to wake him are futile .
no , no , you weren' t there .
this is something entirely different .
all right ... hold on a minute .
i know it' s scary , but we talked about this ... the possibility that things could change once adam crossed the age at which he died .
<i>well , it' s been eight years . </ i>
<i>as of now , he' s crossed it . </ i>
you said things could change ... you never said anything like this .
because i couldn' t have known .
look , he is the only one , period .
<i>we are and always have been</ i> <i>at the mercy of that fact . </ i>
up to this point , we' ve had a map ...
adam' s first eight years .
but now we' re entering uncharted territory .
we have no way of knowing who the adam of age nine , age 10 , age 50 , is going to be , what problems he may or may not have .
i promise you , there' s nothing more a hospital would be doing for him .
what' s happening here , richard ?
that' s what i' d like to find out .
my feeling is it' s probably nothing .
let' s just give it a little time , okay ?
yeah .
the last eight years ... no matter how happy i' ve been ,
i' ve always had this feeling that somehow we wouldn' t get away with this .
not that someone would find out , just ... somehow , we' d lose him again .
we' re not gonna lose him .
we' re not gonna lose him .
it' s okay , it' s okay .
boo !
oh , adam !
oh my gosh !
hey .
but no , no , no ... is he all right ?
he' s fine .
you okay ?
i' m feeling hungry !
mommy !
come on , kiddo .
everything' s okay .
this is fantastic , fantastic .
come on , come on .
you feel good ?
<i>ahh ! </ i>
<i>my god, </ i> <i>you slept enough . </ i>
richard , thank you .
i' il see you all tomorrow .
<i>adam , dinner' s on . </ i>
jessie , he' s not up here .
<i>adam ! </ i>
hey , come on .
adam !
<i>hey ! </ i>
adam ?
adam ?
adam !
adam ?
there you are .
<i>what are you doing here ? </ i>
didn' t you hear me calling you ?
hey ... are you all right ?
i' m talking to you .
adam ?
hey , i' m talking to you .
hey !
answer me .
yes , daddy ?
did you hear me calling you ?
your dinner is ready .
go in the house .
no , paul just said it was kind of a strange moment .
no , he seems fine .
yeah , that' s what i' m hoping ... it' s probably nothing .
i don' t think it' s anything to worry about , okay ?
all right , take care and i' il see you soon .
all right , well , thanks , richard .
take care .
i think we should take him to a specialist .
richard doesn' t think it' s anything to worry about .
and his word' s gospel ?
how long are we supposed to live like this ?
when does all this gratitude end ?
you sure you' re okay ?
yeah .
you sure ?
yeah .
bye , mom .
anybody know what this is ?
it' s a big ugly visual aide .
let' s do it like this .
if you think of dna as a fuse box , aach of the genes are either switched on or off , depending on which cell we' re talking about .
so that the genes responsible for say the length of kevin' s ... ... nose hair wouldn' t be much use in his pinky toe .
so what , the gene isn' t present ?
no , no , it' s present , it' s just inactive .
it' s turned off .
it' s dead .
you know what ?
why don' t you just take a look at chapter 11 for the rest of the period and then , you know , go ?
i' m going to put on a little show for you guys and you' re going to pay me your lunch money .
so pay me and if you don' t ,
i' il beat the crap out of you for the rest of your life .
how about this ?
no .
how about ... yes !
ha ha !
what are you going to do about it , huh ?
you' re a tiny little boy .
what if his having outlived the life of that first original cell has somehow allowed some dormant problem to be switched on ?
listen , maybe it' s significant , maybe it isn' t ,
but the fact remains that any changes in health or behavior
could have occurred naturally the last time as well .
these night terrors ...
if that' s what they are .
paul , it' s a common sleep disorder .
if there' s anything he isn' t , it' s common .
what do you want me to say , paul ?
that there' s something seriously wrong with him ?
you don' t think i' m just as concerned ?
no .
no , i don' t .
you have every right to worry .
but for eight years , we' ve known what to expect .
most parents never have the benefit of hindsight .
from now on , neither do we .
" we " ?
you know what i meant .
can i get back to my patients , please ?
ever want to have any children of your own , richard ?
jessie' s always saying how great you are with adam .
it seems like such a shame .
paul , he' s your son .
believe me , i know what he means to you .
but maybe you can keep in mind what he does mean to me .
here they come .
oh , hey there !
there you are .
why so glum , chum ?
there' s this new kid , roy hazen , he' s always showing off ,
like how high he goes on the swings and stuff .
he' s a total ass wipe .
hey !
where did you learn that language ?
i don' t know .
i don' t like it .
get in the car .
whoa !
oh , god !
adam .
are you all right ?
are you all right ?
i' m fine .
adam !
i didn' t see you .
i' m sorry .
oh , god , i didn' t see you .
i came so close to hitting you .
do you know that ?
do you know you could have been killed just now ?
do you ?
how many times do i got to tell you ...
daddy , you' re hurting me !
to keep your bicycle off the street ?
paul !
what' s the matter with you ?
<i> you okay , honey ? </ i>
<i> yes . </ i>
you sure ?
hello ?
yeah , i would , actually .
let me get a pen .
dr. lieber ?
okay .
in beauford ?
great .
sam , i appreciate this .
talk to you soon .
bye .
who' s that ?
wrong number .
<i>adam ! </ i>
adam ?
adam , open the door .
<i>open the door , son . </ i>
open the door !
<i>adam ? </ i>
<i>open the door . </ i>
god damn it !
open the door , son .
what ... why is the door locked ?
what ?
how ... the curtain .
what ?
the curtain .
he was under there .
no , no , no , no , look .
what are you talking about ?
look , it' s fine .
no , no .
don' t let him hurt me .
shh , there' s nobody going to hurt you .
look , look , look , it' s okay .
shh , calm down .
it' s all right .
i think you just had a bad dream .
no .
huh ?
i saw it .
what ?
what did you see ?
adam , talk to me .
please .
please , you got to talk to me .
i can' t help you if i don' t know what this is .
i just ...
i know something .
okay , what ?
what is it ?
something bad is going to happen .
no , it' s not .
i' il never let anything bad ever happen to you .
not to me .
listen to me , you' re my son , you understand that ?
huh ?
say it .
i' m your son .
that' s right .
we' re gonna be okay .
we' re going to be okay .
so , how many eggs did you retrieve ?
i only retrieved three .
i thought that would be enough ...
richard , hi .
hi .
i' m sorry if this is a bad time .
no , it' s fine .
excuse us .
sure .
what' s the matter ?
you look ...
i need to speak with you about something ...
i have to stop off at home for some papers .
why don' t i fix us some lunch ?
hey , hey , how would you like that ?
<i>i just got an idea . </ i>
how about we have a swinging contest ?
yeah !
you guys will be the judges .
we' il make it very fair .
yeah .
ladies first .
ha ha .
don' t go too high , you' il start crying .
don' t break a nail , oh , no !
<i> come on , you chicken . </ i>
oh , what' s that for ?
nasty monkey .
adam duncan , you stop that at once !
no spitting .
come on , come down from there .
come down .
come down right now .
no ... hey !
hey ...
adam ?
so what you' re saying , these nightmares might have started at this age anyway ?
or possibly triggered by any number of things ... school , stress , tension at home .
yeah , well ...
paul is convinced that somehow adam' s cells have ...
retained memories of his first life ?
there' s an often cited experiment ... a rat was trained to run a maze , killed , then ground up and fed to a second rat .
<i>the second rat , when presented</ i> <i>with the same maze, </ i> completed it in record time , proving that memory lived on in those ingested cells .
it' s fascinating , really , also a bunch of nonsense ... <i>an urban legend . </ i>
so , it' s not possible he' s remembering ?
no , no .
thank god .
frankly , i' m more concerned about paul' s working up these strange theories .
paul is just having a tough time right now .
it' s good .
he' s never felt as comfortable here as you , has he ?
no .
you don' t think he' d ever try to leave , do you ?
jessie , that can' t happen .
out here in the middle of nowhere , it' s easy to forget the consequences of what we' ve done .
but if anyone ever found out , <i>you might</ i> <i>never see adam again . </ i>
i know .
i can trust you to rein paul in ?
yes .
<i>okay , well , i' il go ahead</ i> <i>and see if the auditorium' s available . </ i>
<i>right . </ i>
sorry , i just got the message .
they called me at the high school .
apparently , they couldn' t reach you ?
i was out .
how' s adam ?
he' s fine , mrs. duncan .
i have him waiting in my office right now .
i don' t know exactly how to say this , but ... <i>his behavior has distanced</ i> <i>some of the other children . </ i>
and the thing is , he could have seriously injured himself .
let' s go in and see him , okay ?
is that wine on your breath ?
i was having lunch .
with who ?
<i>why are you so upset ? </ i>
it was just lunch .
i just wanted to talk to him about adam .
god , paul .
wait , where are we going ?
to get a second opinion .
are you kidding me ?
am i smiling ?
<i>about these night terrors ... </ i> you' re confident that' s what this is ?
i see it in a number of kids adam' s age .
scares the bejesus out of the parents , but the kids outgrow it .
as for adam' s recent changes in behavior , well , he' s poorly rested ...
no , you don' t know him .
this is something else .
he won' t leave me alone .
<i>who ? </ i>
<i> zachary . </ i>
zachary ? !
mr. duncan , who is zachary ?
is he a boy in his class ?
i don' t know .
honey , who is zachary ?
he' s the boy who lives in my dreams .
talk to me , pal .
this boy told you his name was zachary ?
not really , i kind of just know .
and you' ve never seen his face ?
he doesn' t like to show it , but i know because of his jacket .
what kind of jacket ?
just let him answer .
it' s red with white sleeves .
<i>where are we going ? </ i>
<i>where are we going ? </ i>
where' s who going , adam ?
adam ?
zachary .
zachary ?
and where are you ?
where we live .
i don' t want to do this .
this is crazy .
according to who ?
richard ?
listen , there' s something he' s not telling us , jessie , i know it .
<i>the way he is handling this, </ i> <i>the way he stays so close to us . </ i>
he cares about us .
i don' t ...
zachary , zachary , where are you ?
tell me about zachary .
he' s never even known a zachary .
what are you trying to tell us , adam ?
say it .
say it !
that' s enough , stop it .
tell us what you' re trying to say .
if you don' t understand it , how do you expect to beat it ?
i don' t want to understand it .
you' re dead !
paul , watch out !
are you okay ?
honey , you okay ?
is he all right ?
he' s okay .
you' re all right , you' re okay .
i' m sorry .
okay , kiddo , there you go .
you' re home now , all right ?
you just go to sleep , all right ?
<i>dad ... </ i> did i die ?
of course not .
you' ve been right here with us .
go to sleep .
oh my god , that' s what this is .
he' s remembering his first life in his dreams .
kids say things like that .
a boy ?
in the city ?
jesus , it' s possible .
if certain genes from the cell used in the procedure managed to retain certain memories ...
he' s not remembering .
how can you say that ?
because he can' t .
honey , wake up .
we' re at school .
<i>okay now , i want</ i> <i>to see everyone in your family</ i> outside your houses in the pictures , okay ?
take your time .
lots of colors .
<i>and don' t forget</ i> <i>to write your name on it . </ i>
<i>nice and big .
i want to put these up</ i> <i>around the classroom . </ i>
<i>beautiful . </ i>
<i>you can put pets</ i> <i>in your pictures ... </ i> <i>dogs and cats . </ i>
<i>have some fun . </ i>
hi , pat .
hi , jessie .
i just thought i' d stop by to see how the stuff' s doing .
come in .
very well .
richard wells was in yesterday .
he bought this big one and these three small ones on the spot .
that' s great .
excuse me a second .
hello .
hi .
<i> richard , hi . </ i>
i just thought i' d see how adam' s doing .
<i>not so well , actually . </ i>
he had another night terror last night .
<i>paul even managed</ i> <i>to get him talking this time . </ i>
i' m wondering if we can use his ability to vocalize in that state to our advantage .
i don' t know .
what would that entail ?
well , for starters , i' d like you to bring him in again .
i' m not sure paul would be comfortable with that .
<i>but i thought we agreed</ i> <i>you' re gonna try to rein him in . </ i>
i know we did .
i' il talk to him , okay ?
<i> please do . </ i>
<i>i need to go , richard . </ i>
<i>good bye . </ i>
come on , you guys , let' s go !
come on , you chickens !
wussies !
let' s go !
i' m doing it !
you can too !
<i>are you afraid of something ? </ i>
<i>let' s go ! </ i>
<i>come on , let' s go ! </ i>
<i>jeez , buddy ! </ i>
<i>let' s go ! </ i>
<i>come on , come on ! </ i>
<i>come on , i' m doing it ! </ i>
<i>you can ! </ i>
what are you , babies ?
you want your ba ba ?
let' s go !
<i>who' s there ? </ i>
oh , no .
please be okay .
please don' t touch this .
jessie ?
<i>you down there ? </ i>
did you hear me ?
huh ?
you okay ?
are you hungry ?
hi , mom .
hi , dad .
yeah .
you hungry ?
<i> hello ? </ i>
no , i' m sorry , tanya , he isn' t .
tanya , slow down .
hold on , i' il ask him right now .
hold on .
adam , roy' s mother says he hasn' t come home from school yet .
do you know where he might be ?
no .
wait , wait , wait .
what were you doing down at the river this afternoon ?
just playing .
with who ?
i' m not supposed to say .
adam , can you answer me ?
go to your room .
now !
i' m sorry , tanya , he doesn' t know .
yeah , good luck .
you said richard mentioned using his ability to vocalize to find out more .
call him .
we' il bring adam in tomorrow .
adam , what' s the name of the school ?
can you tell me the name of the school ?
pius ...
s s street .
could it be saint pius ?
are you sure this can' t hurt him ?
it' s a mild tranquilizer .
we' re just poking around to see what we dig up .
right paul ?
yeah .
adam ... is zachary in there ?
in school ?
they all are .
they all are .
are you sure you wanna do this ?
z zachary .
clark .
<i>z zach ... </ i>
we know this name ?
zachary clark ?
<i>who is zachary clark ? </ i>
they think i' m him .
are you him ?
are you zachary ?
who are you ?
they think i' m him .
they think i' m him !
they think i' m him !
they think i' m him !
no !
adam !
adam ?
richard , release him .
it' s hurting him .
adam ?
wake up .
hot !
hot !
wake up , honey .
adam ?
goddamn it , do something !
adam ?
<i>hot !
hot ! </ i>
<i> adam , wake up .
adam ? </ i>
zachary ?
honey ?
daddy ?
yeah .
<i>you' re okay .
you' re okay . </ i>
hey , why' d you call him zachary ?
answer me , richard .
because he wasn' t responding to his own name .
that' s bullshit !
i want the truth .
you set me up !
it' s okay , it' s okay .
you needed my okay to push him , but you wanted him pushed .
why ?
paul , you' ve gone completely ...
stop telling me what' s wrong with me , and tell me what' s wrong with my goddamn son !
paul ...
i wish i could help you .
adam' s changing .
he' s getting worse .
sometimes it' s like there' s two of him .
he' s destructive .
he' s tried to harm himself .
the other kids at school are scared of him , richard .
there' s something you' re not telling us .
there have been times i' ve seen you talking to him and he' s in that same blank state , but he listens to you , doesn' t he , huh ?
don' t push me , richard .
adam' s all i care about in the whole world .
i' il go public if i don' t get some answers soon , you understand that ?
you understand i' il go public ?
i' m not kidding .
i swear to god , i' il tell the whole goddamn world what you' ve done .
what <i>we' ve done , paul . </ i>
what <i>we' ve done . </ i>
maybe you' re right .
maybe he is remembering .
or maybe it' s something else .
why that name , zachary clark , or the school ?
look , i have tomorrow off ,
it' s a few hours drive into the city .
i' m gonna look into it .
no , paul , absolutely not .
if richard found out ...
he won' t .
i' il leave in the morning .
i won' t be back until afternoon .
<i> paul , no . </ i>
hold on .
<i>no !
no ! </ i>
let me go !
let me go !
<i>nooo !
no ! </ i>
<i>my baby ! </ i>
let me go !
let me go !
no !
my baby !
<i>my baby ! </ i>
my baby !
my baby !
<i>no !
no !
my baby ! </ i>
jessie , can i see you ?
now ?
i told you .
what ?
it doesn' t mean ...
you' re the one who said he never got along with that boy .
the twins said they saw roy playing down by the water , that he' d been showing off .
they' re all but sure he fell in .
you' re not ?
i' m not sure of anything right now .
no matter what he does , he' s still our son .
do you find that comforting right now ?
huh ?
what are you saying ?
you wish we' d never done this ?
good night , baby .
mommy loves you .
you scared me .
it' s okay , mommy .
shit .
sorry , there' s nothing here .
are you sure this is the only saint pius ?
well , it' s the only one in this city .
like i said , they' ve been closed for some time now .
what about past student records , like a search by name ?
i' m looking for a zachary clark .
well , by name could take a while .
i can wait .
a few weeks ?
hi .
yes ?
sorry to bother you .
my name' s paul duncan .
i know this sounds crazy , but i' m here about zachary clark .
<i>does that name mean</ i> <i>anything to you ? </ i>
<i> he' s a young child , a boy . </ i>
<i> no , i' m sorry . </ i>
what about the previous owners ?
did they have any children ?
melinda .
i' m sorry .
no , there were no previous owners .
my husband and i bought this place about six years ago <i>when it was just</ i> <i>a burnt down shell . </ i>
and he' s an architect , so we restored it .
so , it was just vacant ?
<i> well , for a few years , yeah . </ i>
but i don' t know anything about its previous owners .
right .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry , i just ...
i' m sorry to bother you .
sorry , the nanny ... we interviewed quite a few nannies , mostly by phone , but i remember speaking to one who i could have sworn said she used to work for the family who used to live at this address .
i think that i saved her contact information , if ...
great , thank you .
cora williams ?
you don' t know me , but i need to talk to you .
it' s about zachary clark .
come in .
you have no messages .
damn it !
<i>i had hoped i' d never</ i> <i>hear that name again . </ i>
what did he do ?
there had been incidents at school .
he never had any friends , used to come home with all sorts of scrapes .
once they locked him in an empty classroom .
a teacher finally found him , terrified and shaken .
but that was before he started acting up .
<i>pretty soon, </ i> <i>those kids got wise</ i> <i>and just left him alone . </ i>
then there was the fire .
the fire at saint pius ?
<i>they never found out how</ i> <i>the fire got started , but i knew . </ i>
<i>and when zachary came home, </ i> <i>i asked him about it . </ i>
<i>he just gave me this smile . </ i>
adam ?
i swear , when i looked into those eyes of his ,
i didn' t see anything but evil behind them .
<i>i kept my distance . </ i>
<i>i was scared of what else</ i> <i>he might be capable of ... </ i> <i>all these terrible thoughts</ i> <i>running through my mind . </ i>
it was just the two of us at home that day .
he was taking his bath <i>when it suddenly became</ i> <i>clear to me what i had to do . </ i>
<i>he never even</ i> <i>heard me come in . </ i>
<i>i tried</ i> <i>to go through with it . </ i>
<i>i swear i tried , but ... </ i>
i just ...
i couldn' t .
i just couldn' t .
when his mother came home ,
zachary didn' t say a word about what i' d done .
are you here ?
<i>i was at home the next day, </ i> <i>when i was struck</ i> <i>by the most awful premonition . </ i>
<i>i hurried right over . </ i>
<i>two blocks away , i could</ i> <i>already hear the sirens . </ i>
<i>then i saw all that smoke . </ i>
i rushed into the house , blinded by all those flames , praying i wasn' t too late .
but you were .
<i>it turned out his mother</ i> <i>was already dead by then . </ i>
<i>i remember it was</ i> <i>freezing cold that day . </ i>
<i>it was always cold</ i> <i>in that big house . </ i>
adam ?
<i>so she went down</ i> <i>the stairs to the basement, </ i> <i>to check on</ i> <i>the water heater . </ i>
are you down there ?
<i>and that' s where he was ... </ i> <i>just waiting for her . </ i>
so you' re saying zachary killed his mother .
he used a hammer he took down from the wall .
and when he was done , he set a fire .
<i>then he went upstairs</ i> <i>and finished playing . </ i>
that' s where they found his body .
where was his father ?
oh , he was at the hospital like always .
the hospital , he was a doctor ?
<i>a baby doctor , yeah . </ i>
only , he seemed more like a scientist to me .
<i>come on , come on . </ i>
come on .
goddamn it !
<i>are you home ?
jessie ? </ i>
<i>pick it up</ i> <i>if you' re there , please . </ i>
<i>listen , i gotta talk to you</ i> <i>right away , it' s important . </ i>
<i>call me as soon</ i> <i>as you get this . </ i>
<i> i love you . </ i>
<i>adam ? </ i>
honey , you shouldn' t have opened that .
you shouldn' t have touched that box .
adam ?
is this me ?
honey , let me explain .
adam .
zachary .
what ? !
i need to speak with richard wells .
<i>i' m sorry , but dr. wells</ i> <i>is at the hazen funeral today . </ i>
a funeral where ?
honey , don' t be scared .
it' s okay .
i' m right here .
just be careful , okay ?
what was that ?
honey ...
<i>mommy ? </ i>
adam , where are you ?
adam ?
adam can' t come out to play right now , mrs. duncan .
wait .
wait !
let me explain .
adam .
you couldn' t use him , could you ?
zachary .
you couldn' t use him .
maybe it never even occurred to you to try .
no , it occurred to me .
but the fire destroyed him , right ?
you didn' t even have a viable cell .
his genetics i could salvage , but it was no more than pieces of a map .
i saved what i could , but after that ...
i was this close to perfecting the procedure , you can' t possibly fathom that kind of torture .
to have this knowledge , this power , and know there' s nothing more you can do about it .
but you did do things about it , richard .
once you had adam' s cell , you could preserve his physical characteristics and manipulate certain genes ... intangibles , like cognition , personality , his memory .
i' m right , aren' t i ?
except for one thing .
there was no way to predict the results .
i could only wait and hope for a glimpse of him , the mere indication that something had lived on .
lived on ?
do you have any idea what you' ve done to my son ? !
to my family ?
i' d think you of all people would understand , seeing as we were both after the same thing .
i just wanted him back .
you experimented with a human life !
so did you .
so did your wife .
no , i would say there' s a huge difference ...
is there , paul ?
do you think you can just open pandora' s box and then just close it again ?
we trusted you , goddamn it !
we had no way of knowing .
what you did goes way beyond ...
beyond what ?
societal standards ?
you name me a single medical advancement that didn' t .
tell me something .
if i' m not supposed to do this , paul , then how is it that i can ?
because you' re a scientist .
only this isn' t about science or evolution ... it' s about moral trespass , about your ignoring what' s right and wrong .
and what about you , paul ?
have you trespassed ?
i don' t know .
yeah , maybe this is my punishment for wanting something that i never should have had .
and if that' s the case , then so be it .
but believe me when i tell you , i' m gonna do everything in my power to save my child and see that you pay for what you' ve done .
paul ...
no , this is over , you understand ?
we' re gonna go to the police , and then we' re gonna find someplace , anyplace that can help him .
you' re not going anywhere ...
like hell i' m not !
that was an experiment .
that experiment failed .
we can always terminate and try again .
terminate ?
that' s my son you' re talking about .
our son !
he' s yours because i gave him to you .
you stay away from him !
you hear me ?
you stay away !
you were lucky to have him as long as you did .
you had nothing when i found you .
i gave you a child , a house , a job .
anything in your life that you value , i provided .
you remember that , you ... you ungrateful piece of shit !
why , why , why didn' t he listen ?
adam !
adam ?
are you in here ?
adam , where are you ?
let go .
let go of the axe .
adam .
adam .
yes , daddy ?
who are you ?
who are you right now ?
i' m your son .
come on , max , throw it .
throw it , come on .
goes upstairs .
all right , if you guys can paint that out by thursday , that' d be great .
mr. duncan , that' s gonna look great .
great .
how are you doing ?
all right .
these are going downstairs .
go , go , go !
hey , how do you like your new room ?
it' s not finished yet .
hey , kiddo , look ...
it' s a big change , we know .
but those doctors you' ve been working with , they all say this change could be really good for you , right ?
sweetie , you' ve been doing so great .
and i bet ... in a new town , with new friends , you' re gonna do even better .
i know .
<i>mrs .
duncan ? </ i>
coming .
hey ...
i got three boxes downstairs
and they' re all labeled ...
toys .
how about you give me a hand unpacking ' em ?
yeah ?
<i>where would you like these ? </ i>
oh , careful with that , it' s going downstairs .
hey , kiddo , i thought you were ...
adam ?
ahh !
god !
i thought you were coming down .
are you all right ?
you' d tell me if there was anything ...
nothing' s wrong , daddy .
i' m fine .
all right .
trust me .
this is gonna be great for us .
hey .
it' s a place we can start all over .
