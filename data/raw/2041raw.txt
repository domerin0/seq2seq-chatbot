dear mom , get well soon
tell the head nurse to stay .
ryoko , ryoko ...
ryoko , ryoko ...
hello !
i' m sorry .
5 : 28 pm .
i brought this for mom .
7 years later
hey , let' s go home .
the waves are too high .
dad , no luck again ?
you don' t understand .
i' m only after the big ones .
i prefer real life girls to imaginary big fish .
well ...
when you grow up , you' il understand .
it' s called romanticism .
hello .
i have done the planning .
i' il bring it tomorrow .
yes ...
hello ?
sorry i have to go .
this is too big for us .
we' il share it with rie .
you don' t bring friends home anymore .
is everything ok ?
did you know that black sea bream originate as males ?
what ?
when they reach 15 cm long , they become unisex .
then some become female .
oh really ?
what about this one ?
we saw ovaries .
did we ?
i don' t know very much about ovaries .
you don' t look young anymore .
what ?
you look very plain .
gang .
hey , dad , why don' t you get remarried ?
why do you say that ?
i just simply think so .
thanks for the dinner .
it' s your turn for the dishes .
it looks like a ceremony for a religious cult .
they' re pretty much the same .
lonely .
happy people wouldn' t go to that kind of concert .
the whole of japan is lonely .
are you ?
you too , right ?
boss .
mr. ueno wants to change tomorrow' s meeting from 1 : 00 to 3 : 30 pm .
that' s okay by me .
i' il be here .
i' il drop in at starts and then meet yoshikawa tonight .
i won' t be back at the office .
any changes and i' il call you on your cell phone .
yeah .
well ...
i' m going to marry soon .
really ?
congratulations .
to whom ?
someone you don' t know .
congratulations anyway .
you' re a busy man .
it' s all right , but ...
the profit margins are getting thinner .
how about you ?
don' t you know ?
the movie industry is profitable .
really ?
i' m lying .
it' s like a survival game , or a game of torture .
is it no good ?
seems like a bright future ahead .
but i don' t know how long we can hang in there .
yoshikawa .
didn' t you say the same thing a year ago ?
did i ?
awful girls .
no class and stuck up .
stupid as well .
where are all the good girls ?
japan is finished .
let me say ...
i intend to get married again .
well , what made you decide to do that ?
who' s she ?
i haven' t found her yet .
my son said to me that i look old and that i should get married again .
that' s the story .
you look old ...
how are you going to look for one ?
an arranged marriage ?
no , that' s not my style .
i wish there was a very nice woman hiding somewhere .
what is your ideal woman like ?
preferably young ?
not too young .
she could possibly have a job , and some training .
training ?
for instance , playing the piano , singing or dancing .
your ex wife ryoko was like that .
certain training gives people confidence .
a lack of confidence brings unhappiness .
pianist .
it' il cost you more .
she need not necessarily be a professional .
i don' t want to fail at marriage at my age .
i' d like to have enough time to observe her .
i' d like to see many women and then choose my ideal one .
what are you laughing at ?
am i expecting too much ?
i probably am .
no , i can handle that .
i have an idea .
have an audition .
it' il be a romantic story .
remember your documentary ?
love triangle between dancer , patron and a down syndrome boy .
teamed up with a german tv station .
i' il rearrange the story .
any problems ?
i don' t see any problems , but we' re going to audition ?
trust me .
have i ever disappointed you ?
well no , but ...
the heroine is supposed to be in her early 20' s to 30 .
the conditions are that she be a well trained person .
no problems , huh ?
wouldn' t it be fraudulent ?
this audition is not only about finding you a wife .
it' s part of making a movie .
collect enough money , we have the movie .
the story isn' t bad .
well ...
am i supposed to marry the main girl ?
no , a girl with that much talent wouldn' t marry you .
they aren' t the marrying type .
really good ones will always fail the second interview .
really ?
they are quite attractive .
smart , with a good upbringing .
traditional and well trained .
wishing her to be your son' s wife ?
i don' t get it .
why can' t she get the main part ?
they are not unhappy .
happy people can' t act well .
and another thing .
i have a plan to work with fm , i' il combine this .
make another program called " tomorrow' s heroine " .
trust me .
i' m a pro at auditions .
this is yoshikawa .
i' m in room number 2 .
coffee ?
is coffee ok for you ?
bring two coffees please .
i' m in a middle of a traffic jam , i might be late ...
please hand that tape to mr. kaneda .
thanks .
tomorrow' s heroine .
i' m just wondering where you are ?
wonderful things might happen .
if you encourage yourself a little bit more .
every star has their defining moment .
hepburn and julia roberts .
they led their own lives prior to becoming heroines .
tomorrow' s heroine is living at the same time as you are .
no , tomorrow' s heroine could be you yourself .
i' m home .
here we go .
you' re home early .
that' s right , i' ve got to work at home tonight .
please heat up your dinner .
the bigger dish is for shigehiko .
thanks .
see you on monday .
my daughter' s here this weekend .
i' ve got to go shopping .
that' s nice .
hey gang .
please put your washing in the basket .
good bye .
thanks .
bye .
hello .
it' s me .
yoshikawa .
i' m checking the applications .
they' re all good , right ?
i don' t know what i' m supposed to do .
it' s like buying my first car .
don' t mix your car and wife .
i intend to hold the audition next week .
choose 30 applicants .
30 applicants ?
that' s right .
alright .
i' il let you know .
don' t trust pictures .
composition can be more useful .
understood .
see you .
bye .
choose 30 from all of you ?
you' re home ?
why don' t you knock at the door ?
you just arrived ?
yeah .
dinner ?
i' il eat later .
why don' t you eat first ?
alright .
i' m having a guest tonight .
girlfriend ?
give her my dinner .
thank you .
what did i do !
asami yamazaki .
classical ballet for 12 years .
i' m not sure that i can make an actress of myself .
and you probably won' t choose me .
i was simply attracted to this story .
i studied ballet , but damaged my hips when i was 18 .
i was devastated as i intended to practice in london .
ballet was my priority .
so my dream collapsed .
it might sound exaggerated , but it' s like accepting death .
living is another way of reaching death .
i think i know these facts very well .
that' s why i applied for this part .
when was this dinosaur living ?
about the later cretaceous period .
the later part of cretaceous means ...
that' s a sauropod , right ?
good .
what about the dinosaur that has the syracuse model ?
i don' t know .
do you want to see ?
hi !
good evening .
good evening .
i' m his father .
my name is misuzu .
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you too .
i often see her on the train .
i thought she was pretty , so i talked to her .
good job .
i' m interested in biology .
he showed me his books .
we ate your dinner .
fine .
was it his ?
i' m sorry i ate your meal .
terribly sorry .
i will cook something for you .
don' t worry about it .
take it easy .
gang .
good boy .
let' s go for a walk .
shigehiko , make sure she gets home alright .
of course .
ok boy , come on .
let' s go , gang .
ready ?
well ...
i feel like a criminal .
i' m ready .
let' s start .
pleased to meet you .
please sit .
my name is yu tanaka .
please have a seat .
are you nervous ?
a little bit .
sorry , you are the first one .
that' s ok .
we' re going to tape you .
but don' t worry .
do you mind if i ask what your father' s job is ?
well ... my father' s ... job is ...
what can i say ?
next one .
i' m going to ask you frankly .
why did you apply for this part ?
have you ever had sex with someone you don' t like ?
are you interested in drugs ?
can you act a little bit for us ?
sure .
go ahead .
what music do you like ?
which actress do you like ?
i like mituko mori .
next .
i used to love sports .
at school , i played ...
did you ever want to work for the sex industry ?
i have a friend who is working in that area .
next .
what are men to you ?
have you ever seen tarkovsky' s films ?
ren osugi .
we have some sex scenes .
can you handle that ?
no problem .
are you psychic ?
next .
may i ask you a question ?
can you smile ?
what kind of men don' t you like ?
yoko sugimura .
nice to meet you .
if i didn' t have confidence i wouldn' t be an actress .
excuse me .
when i was 2 , mother decided that i' d be an actress .
can you walk around the chair ?
turn around .
next please .
nice meeting you .
it' s time for a break from our schedule .
we' re 30 minutes late .
let' s take a 10 minute break .
sure .
you don' t seem too enthusiastic .
don' t tell me you' re not interested anymore .
it' s not like that .
then what ?
i' m nervous myself .
i need to use the toilet .
i lived in paris for 3 years .
and have come back to tokyo as a designer .
i can' t think about anything else but being an actress .
my office was only for adult videos .
keep her for another job .
i' m not satisfied being called a cover girl queen .
this scar is from my first suicide attempt and this is from the second .
i' ve been to an asylum 3 times .
next .
emi kitani .
pleased to meet you .
we finished your interview before .
but i haven' t finished what i have to say .
you have a nice career , why do you want to be an actress ?
i think i' ve been doing very well , but ...
sorry .
i' m a children' s nurse .
my work is very hard ...
next please .
ms. asami yamazaki .
please .
asami yamazaki .
have a seat .
sorry for the delay .
it' s ok .
have you done any movies or tv jobs ?
i' ve had many opportunities , but actually haven' t done any .
do you belong to any agency ?
not really .
but i' m on keep for a record company director .
but we haven' t contacted each other recently .
which record company ?
ace records .
could you tell me your personal contact' s name ?
japanese music dept .
director shibata .
since you quit your previous job , you' re unemployed ?
how do you manage your daily expenses ?
if you don' t mind telling us .
i help at a friend' s shop .
3 times a week .
what kind of shop ?
a small bar in ginza .
the owner used to be a class mate in voice training .
if i keep my costs low , i have no money problems .
don' t you want to lead a luxurious life ?
too poor isn' t good .
but i can afford books and cds .
that' s enough for me .
can i ask you about ballet ?
certainly .
you damaged your hips .
that' s correct .
it must have been awful to quit what you' d been doing .
yes .
i must sound a bit rude but ...
your writing says that quitting what you liked ... ... is almost similar to accepting death .
i was highly impressed .
i think everybody has similar experiences .
in your lifetime when you have something beyond your control .
what can you do but accept it ?
i think that' s life .
i mean ...
i was amazed a young girl like you understands that .
i think you live your life in a very thoughtful way .
that' s what i thought .
thank you very much .
are you finished ?
thank you for coming .
we may contact you later .
yes .
excuse me .
may i call the next one ?
let' s have a 15 minute break .
fine .
please tell mr. ito i' il be late .
what do you think ?
she made me very nervous .
i wanted a cigarette .
you decided on her before the audition .
i like her much more than her nice writing .
i think you live your life in a very thoughtful way .
it' s not an interviewer' s comment .
i was stunned .
don' t joke about that .
she really impressed me .
i' m sure she' s a serious type of girl .
she is better than her photo and may also be good hearted .
but i don' t like her .
what' s wrong with her ?
something chemical .
can' t say exactly what' s wrong .
i just don' t like her .
your girlfriend seemed nice .
misuzu ?
she looked nice , but ...
what ?
one of those girl things .
i don' t understand girls .
don' t you ?
thanks .
hey , dad , about your remarriage .
preferably someone who cooks better than rie .
why are you in such a hurry ?
new discovery of another dinosaur , from argentina .
that one could be older than euraptile .
really .
i' il be busy collecting information .
take a bath .
yes , hello .
sorry for calling so late .
this is producer aoyama .
i interviewed you today .
thank you for your time today .
not at all .
well ...
i wondered if you might have some time to talk with me .
of course .
i' d love to see you .
when would be good for you ?
anytime would be fine , during the daytime .
really .
let me see .
for instance ...
good night .
this is the aoyama residence .
it' s me .
how is it ?
about ms. yamazaki .
not that i doubted her , i called ace records .
it' s no big deal , but something didn' t seem right .
what is it ?
director shibata isn' t at the company .
to be precise , he isn' t there anymore .
he' s been missing for a year .
he just disappeared .
i' m nervous .
please relax , i won' t ask you any special questions .
you only ask of me to enjoy this nice food and talk ?
absolutely .
that' s the best request i' ve ever had .
just one question .
your director contact .
mr. shibata ?
i' m sorry i said so at the audition , but ...
in fact i' ve never met him .
i don' t belong to any actors ' agency .
i was advised to answer you like that .
is that so ?
i didn' t mean to tell a lie .
it' s ok .
i' ve clarified that question , that' s no problem .
here we go .
looks wonderful .
go ahead .
yummy .
good .
i hope i' m not asking you too much , and ...
you probably can' t , but ...
if you have some free time ...
i' d like to talk to you more .
i don' t have anybody to be frank with .
if i' m good enough , i' d love to .
really ?
i' m very happy about that .
i' il try not to bother you .
i don' t mind any place .
even on the telephone would be fine .
i' il write my cellular phone number on my business card .
please call me anytime .
thank you very much .
thank you for the meal too .
i' ve decided .
i don' t care about the movie , i' m interested only in her .
don' t worry about the movie .
i' il handle that matter .
but don' t be too hasty .
you wanted to have some time to observe your prospect .
why are you so negative about her ?
what' s wrong with her ?
i only think that life isn' t so easy .
she is beautiful , classy and obedient .
such a woman not having any boyfriends is unthinkable .
i checked out her associates , none are accessible .
the bar she was talking about is also an unknown .
we can' t reach anybody who knows her .
i wasn' t born yesterday .
i won' t be fooled that easily .
i trust myself over some other' s evaluation .
if there' s any trouble , i can solve it .
ok .
you said i could find my ideal woman from an audition .
i appreciate it .
hey , aoyama .
promise me one thing .
don' t call her .
hopefully i' m wrong about this , but ...
it' s going to affect your whole life .
don' t be so hasty .
cool down a bit .
alright .
i promise you .
you' re not sick , are you ?
it is rare for you to take a day off .
since i' ve worked for you , i' ve never seen you like this .
oh well ...
it' s good to have a break .
you might be a little tired .
since your wife died , you' ve worked very hard for your son .
forming your own company , which is doing quite well .
you work too much .
i wish my husband was like you .
my life would be easier .
you must have a nice girlfriend .
i' m sure you do .
men can' t maintain without female support .
i' ve finished .
i' m going home .
bye .
see you tomorrow .
i' m leaving .
see you .
oh ?
what is it ?
not really .
see you tomorrow .
bye .
this is aoyama .
really ?
good .
i thought you wouldn' t phone me anymore .
if i told the truth , you might think that i' m a heavy woman .
i' ve been longing for your call .
sorry .
so how are you ?
what ?
what' s so funny ?
i never thought about having a date with you again .
so i' m pretty excited .
here we go .
i never asked you about your family .
are they fine ?
they' re fine .
you' re from tokyo , right ?
they bought a house in chiba .
just moved in last month .
my father loves golf , living in chiba is more convenient .
really ?
we are not that close .
but not that distant either .
quite an average family .
do you still work at the bar ?
yes .
is that in ginza ?
it' s on 4th street .
called the stone fish .
funny name .
the stone fish ?
shall i come for a drink ?
thank you ... but ... ... the owner interferes with my private things .
if you don' t want me to come of course i won' t .
i' m just curious about you .
i won' t lie to you , definitely not .
i promise .
i have to tell you ...
can i tell you the truth about the movie ?
someone else got the part ?
it' s not like that .
the movie itself .
actually the sponsor didn' t like some of the story .
we had to suspend it .
in the worst case it might not come out .
oh really ?
you might be hurt .
not me .
but you might be .
you read my composition , didn' t you ?
i never thought i' d get the main part .
it' s ok .
the good thing is that i met you .
i felt wonderful seeing myself in the mirror .
joining images of myself and beautiful things .
that' s incredible , i trained myself hard to release pain .
that' s why i could tolerate hard lessons .
but eventually i lost my precious ballet .
it' s hard to forget about it .
but someday you' il feel that life is wonderful .
that' s life , isn' t it ?
thank you .
living alone is a hassle .
i have nobody to talk with .
there were some guys that approached me .
but you are the first one to support me .
warmly wrapping me and trying to understand me .
let' s have dinner soon .
when will that be ?
sorry .
am i pushing you ?
i' il call you .
yes , i' il wait for you .
here is fine .
please stop the car .
she' s getting off .
thank you very much for today .
see you .
good night .
bye .
take me to okusawa .
yes ?
can i talk to you for a moment ?
what ?
well well , the drapes are dirty .
what ?
well ...
you found a girlfriend .
am i right ?
bingo .
you look a little different , sometimes you even smile .
she is only 24 years old .
she' s closer to my age .
must be very beautiful .
i' m the same as you .
i like the beautiful ones .
don' t get fooled .
i' m much cleverer than you .
have you proposed to her ?
not yet .
we are going away this weekend .
i' m going to propose to her then .
good luck !
i' il introduce her to you soon .
let me check her out first .
i trust my hunches .
because you' re blind in love now .
well , what can we do before dinner ?
i know the chef here is very good .
he provides very nice food .
but he has a terrible mouth .
there is a little museum close by .
if we leave now , we could still make it .
it' s about 20 minutes by car .
after that , we could go to the harbour .
it' s a little harbour , but it has a nice coffee shop .
they serve nice cheesecake .
their desserts are ...
come to me .
please .
don' t take off your clothes yet .
please ...
look at my body .
i burnt myself when i was little .
i want you to know all about me .
you are very beautiful .
please love me .
only me .
i understand .
everybody says so .
but i hope you are different from the others .
only me .
ok ?
only me .
please love me .
only me .
yes .
is that mr. aoyama ?
this is the front desk .
yes .
i' m terribly sorry .
you must be in bed .
we tried calling many times but there was no answer .
your partner has left .
we want to confirm your stay .
sorry to call you so late , but we need to know .
left ?
what you are saying is she disappeared ?
nobody answers the phone .
there' s no way to contact her .
i don' t know exactly where she lives either .
what happened in the hotel ?
i told you all about it .
but normally people don' t disappear like that .
we might have misunderstood each other somehow .
i just want to talk to her face to face .
yoshikawa , can you find out her address ?
aoyama , i' ve only got her resume .
it' s impossible .
why don' t you forget about her .
i can' t do that .
i can' t finish everything like this .
i know i can' t convince you but ...
i suggest you forget about her .
you' re saying ... ... that i ... ... went too crazy about a young girl .
eventually being left alone like a pathetic old fart ?
yes , you are .
what' s the matter with you ?
you said that you weren' t born yesterday .
whatever problems come up , you fix them , right ?
oh come on !
what ?
it' s ok .
what' s ok about it ?
it' s ok now .
i won' t ask your help anymore .
i' il look for her .
i' il look for her myself .
aoyama !
shimada ballet studio
excuse me ?
excuse me , but ...
excuse me .
are you ...
are you mr. shimada ?
i' m the one who called you this afternoon .
about miss asami yamazaki .
go home .
let me be frank with you .
did you have any problems with asami before ?
i just want to know how to contact her .
and i' m looking for a clue .
did you see her ?
yes .
did you hear her voice ?
what do you mean by that ?
did you touch her body ?
did you hold her in your arms ?
how was that ?
was it good ?
did you smell her ?
asami ...
go home .
4th street .
the stone fish .
the stone fish
no one is there .
are you closed today ?
that bar closed about a year ago .
that was huge mess .
the owner was murdered .
do you know an asami who used to work here ?
asami ?
i don' t recall .
normally the owner worked here alone .
asami was supposed to be working here 3 times a week .
some kind of a mistake .
excuse me ...
why was the owner killed ?
i' m not sure but people talked about some sort of man problem .
she used to be associated with a music industry guy .
she used drugs too .
did she get murdered here ?
the body was chopped up completely .
it' s a 28 year old building .
the whole thing is tilted .
we saw her blood flowing through a gap in the door .
the other mystery was ...
the police tried to recompose her body together .
3 extra fingers and an ear came up .
an extra tongue as well .
isn' t it a terrible world ?
meal time , gang .
bye .
hi , this is shigehiko .
i' m going to stay at my friend' s house tonight .
it' s none of my business , but eat properly .
there' s some yogurt there , please have it .
and gang was hiding .
underneath the house , please feed him .
talk to you later .
i' m sorry .
how have you been ?
i never expected we would meet again .
sorry to be childish .
i never asked you about your family .
are they fine ?
when i was little , my parents got a divorce .
i was sent to my uncle' s house .
that was a terrible place .
i only remember being abused .
my uncle' s wife was that sort of woman .
i have many scars .
if it' s too painful , you needn' t talk about .
no , i want you to know all about me .
i was forced into cold baths in winter , and i got pneumonia .
she pushed me down the staircase .
i broke my shoulder bone .
the doctor worried about me .
he sent me back to my mother' s home .
when was that ?
i was 7 years old .
really .
my mother had remarried .
i' ve reduced the scars .
but my stepfather ...
hated me so much .
he' s got disabled legs .
staying at home all the time .
i did nothing in a dark room everyday .
until my mother came home .
i' m sorry .
it' s not a normal story is it ?
if you dislike me , please say so .
strange .
i never imagined you' d had such an agonizing past .
because ballet supported me .
you had talent .
i' m not sure .
but when i danced , it purified the dark side of me .
that' s the reason why i never tried to kill myself .
i think ... you' re wonderful .
i' ve been looking for someone like you .
darling .
ryoko .
this is an opportune time .
let me introduce you .
this is asami .
no ...
she isn' t good for you .
she' s a very fine woman .
no ... darling , no .
i want ...
i want you right now .
asami .
that was a little mistake .
you made love to me .
only once .
i expected something from you .
was i stupid ?
sorry .
forgive me .
i' il do anything to give you pleasure .
i like doing this .
what are you doing !
stop it .
look , you' ve got a hard on .
stop it !
3 extra fingers , an ear ... ... and a tongue too .
you only love me .
only me .
asami .
asami .
dance for me .
dance .
dance .
dance , bitch !
dance ... ... for me otherwise ... ... i' il torture you !
dance .
please .
dance for me .
dance !
asami ...
good girl .
asami !
this wire can ... ... cut meat and bone very easily .
you are wonderful .
i never felt unhappy .
because i' ve been unhappy all the time .
asami !
please stop !
no !
males need female support .
otherwise they can' t maintain .
let' s have an audition .
my son told me that i look old .
why don' t i remarry .
that' s why i decided .
asami ...
you ...
you can' t move any more .
i' ve paralyzed your body but your nerves are still awake .
you can enjoy the pain and suffer incredibly .
you guys collect many girls from auditions .
make them fail .
you contact them later .
just wanting to have sex .
everybody is the same .
deeper , deeper ...
deeper , deeper ...
painful ?
words create lies .
pain can be trusted .
right ?
you can feel pain .
you can study about the human body as well .
deeper ...
this is the most painful point .
am i right ?
then here too .
here as well .
right ?
deeper , deeper ...
deeper , deeper ...
deeper , deeper ...
here we go .
underneath the eyes is also very painful .
you only realize what kind of man you are ... ... when you feel pain , you understand .
when you have a very agonizing experience .
your son is called shigehiko , right ?

i' ve only got you .
but you have so many others .
i don' t want to be one of them .
even if i give you all of me , you won' t be mine completely .
everybody is the same .
everybody .

you can' t go anywhere without feet .
this wire can cut meat and bone easily .
stop it !

proposal ?
it' s like a dream .
i' m so happy .
i applied for the audition .
i was the ...
... luckiest one .
because i didn' t become the heroine of the movie .
but i became the real heroine .
deeper , deeper ...
what' s wrong , dad ?

his left leg has been chopped off and is bleeding badly .

i thought you were very busy .
i don' t know your job so well .
i might sound heavy .
but i' ve been waiting for your call for a long time .
i never expected that we would meet again .
sorry to have been childish .
it' s a hassle living alone .
i didn' t have anybody to talk with .
you are the first one to support me ...
warmly wrapping me ...
trying to understand me ...
it' s hard to forget about .
but someday you' il feel ... ... that life is wonderful .
that' s life , isn' t it ?
