we' ve got him .
other there .
rescue centre , over .
this is 3 .
go ahead .
you will have sufficient cloud base to get into the tower .
there is still some turbulence .
we advise against a winch rescue .
i' il proceed with a wire cross from the opposite tower .
gabe , hal' s signalling that he' s okay .
gabe , where are you ?
i' m just hanging out , jess .
that butt looks familiar .
careful , you' il embarrass frank .
it' il take more than that .
gabe , they' re below the top , on the ledge just above you .
glad you could join us .
sure .
hi , sarah .
so , how' s the knee ?
i think it' s out .
no big deal .
i remember when you twisted it getting out of the hot tub .
i thought you did it in nam ?
really ?
i' ve located a stranded climber .
please send down a transport line .
how are you feeling ?
fine , considering .
what do you say we take off and leave this clown behind ?
don' t tempt me .
rescue 3 ... be advised ranger walker is making advances toward my girlfriend .
say he' il make advances to me only , or he' il be climbing down 4, 000 ft .
baby , he lies .
is it really 4, 000 ?
about that .
whatever this guy says about me , don' t believe it .
okay , come on over .
i know you' re nervous , but we' ve done this 100 times .
captain hot tub , keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle .
great , hal !
that really inspires confidence .
how did he get you to climb here ?
he said it was better than sex .
ready for the park' s best ride ?
i' il let you know .
you look like hell .
he made it .
of course , there' s nothing to it .
i can do this .
sure you can .
i' m sorry for all the trouble .
don' t worry about it .
did you see that ?
we' re still on for dinner tonight ?
of course .
okay , you' re ready now .
that' s it .
just sit down into it .

one hand after another .
you' re doing great .

that' s it .
one , two ...
sarah !
i' m going to fall .
no you' re not .
you' re okay .

no !
keep the line steady .
that clip won' t hold .
gabe , you have to go after her .
sarah , i' m coming to get you .

i' il send out my harness .
there' s no time for that .
shit !
no !
sarah , i' m coming for you .
i' m slipping .
i' m coming for you .
hurry , i can' t hold on .
don' t look down .
look at me .
i' m trying .
she' s losing it .
he' il have you in a second , baby .
hurry , gabe .
you' re almost there .
i' m here , sarah ,
i don' t want to die .
reach up and grab him .
reach up .
use your other hand .
hold on .
i' ve got you .
i can' t hold on .
you' re not going to die .

good .
mr. travers .
this is agent matheson , fbl .
richard travers .
matheson has been transferred to the frisco office .
can he hitch a ride ?
we' ve got plenty of room .
i appreciate it .
have you been totally briefed ?
i don' t know about totally ...
it' s a protective shipment . $1, 000 bills aren' t in circulation .
they' re for international exchange .
do you always transport by air ?
cars and trains can be hijacked .
nobody can touch us in flight .
i haven' t lost a bill in 12 years .
treasury agents are the most superstitious of all .
we should be .
everybody wants what we have .
it' s gabe .
he' s back .
i can see that .
gabe !
let' s go .
how are you doing ?
turn that down .
how you doing , guys ?
did you fall off the planet ?
i' ve been working in denver .
don' t say that word , man .
i hate work .
we' re flying off the tower today .
come with us .
today' s the day .
killer jump .
no , thanks .
are you scared of heights now ?
no ...
you guys better watch out .
some bad weather' s coming in .
we like it extreme .
it' s good to have you back .
good to see you .
how are you doing , jess ?
hello , gabriel .
you' ve got yourself a new horse ?
where have you been ?
working .
after the funeral i had to leave .
had to leave ?
a lot of us wanted to leave .
but you know what ?
we stayed .
things fell apart on that ledge .
i know .
you don' t know how much .
you did everything you could .
did i ?
maybe i shouldn' t have gone out on that line .
maybe i panicked .
i was there .
you didn' t panic , so quit hoarding all the guilt .
you held on as long as you could .
and what was hal doing on the tower with an amateur ?
i can' t blame hal for anything .
it was me .
all me .
give it up , gabe , because it doesn' t get any better .
it doesn' t get any better ?
you really don' t understand .
what ?
i don' t think you understand .
i don' t understand ?
i think i' m the only one that understands .
there were times when i didn' t know whether to hate you or love you .
but one thing i do know is , i understand you .
did you come back to stay ?
you didn' t .
i can' t , not here .
jessie , i came back for you .
i want you to come with me .
you' ve been gone almost a year and you expect me to just leave ?
this is our home .
now it' s my home .
i can' t just pick up and go for all the wrong reasons .
i better get the rest of my stuff .
you know where everything is .
i' m late for work .
r 5 l , broken cloud at 20, 000 feet .
severe storm advisory .
check the scope .
i hear you' ve been transferred .
yeah , moving up in the world .
jessie , look at this masterpiece .
i think old frank nailed it with that stroke .
what do you think ?
i don' t know .
what do you see ?
surprise me .
what usually eats a banana ?
a monkey .
this is a banana eating a monkey .
nature in reverse .
where ?
right here .
frank , you look like a normal guy , but he' s not .
are you , frankie ?
hey , i' m an artist .
we' re being tracked .
we have a jetstar at three o' clock .
don' t anyone jump to conclusions .
he' s coming in too slow .
slow down to 180 knots .
he' s slowing down .
get your guns .
i have jurisdiction on this jet .
now i have jurisdiction .
get your weapons .
mr. matheson , you' re overreacting .
calm down and give me the gun .
don' t you see what he' s doing ?
he' s hijacking the shipment .
what the fuck was that ?
move into position .
crossover transfer in ten seconds .
n 1295 l , this is jetstar 680 tt .

the weather ahead is threatening .
travers , report your position .
disengaging tail cone .
tail cone is clear .
roger .

she' s all over the place .

the welcoming party is ready .
we' re coming to pick up the drogue now .
we' ve got it .

standing by .
we' re locked on .
lnto the transfer position .
moving into transfer position .
closing to 1 40 feet .
we' re closing .
will report when in position .
we' re too close to the storm .
that' il make the crash look real .
hurry up , travers .
i' m on my way .
the cases are hooked up .
the charge goes off in five minutes .
stick to the plan and you' re rich .
tt , in position .
what' s taking so long ?
patience .
i' m coming over .
tt standing by at level 140 and 260 degrees .
5 l , i' m out of here .
what the hell is he doing ?
where are the cases ?
we' ve got him , kristel .
why didn' t you send the money first ?
somehow i didn' t think you' d wait for me .
we' re approaching the storm fast .
90 seconds , kristel .
what' s keeping him ?
move your ass .
i' m at the cases .
tt , standing by .
you fuck !
we' ve lost the pilot .
who did you leave up there ?
get underneath the jet .
the cases will slide over .
who the fuck is that ?
just get those cases .
he' s hurt bad .
get him to a hospital fast .
we' re not levelling out .
i' ve lost hydraulics .
the cable has blown free .
don' t lose the money .
pull the cable .
the switches are dead .
nothing .
okay , switch to manual .
hold the plane steady !
pull !
come on !
how' s number one engine ?
oil pressure falling .
shit !
we' ve lost them .
release the cable .
close it up .
so this is your idea of a fool proof plan ?
stupid bastard .
what' s the report ?
he shot out the hydraulics .
i' ve got a fire warning light .
we' re going down .
pick your way through the peaks .
shut off all fuel pumps .
don' t buckle up , you may not want to survive this .
flaps to 25 degrees before we lose all power .
reduce power 60 % .
crank the flaps down .
gear down ?
no .
shut down all power .
give me a hand with the controls .
did you catch that thunder ?
that wasn' t thunder .
come on .
i' m free !
radical , man .
look at me .
mike ?
shit .
you thought of everything .
except this .
kill the pig .
pig , my ass !
we' re partners in this .
we were .
give me the tracking monitor .
what the hell for ?
don' t make him ask you twice .
give it to him .
here , it' s only got 50, 000 code variations .
i' il break your fucking neck .
go ahead .
but you' re going to need that money to buy your way out of this country .
you know it , and i know it .
how do we get off the mountain ?
kristel ?
i think we' ve found a frequency .
somebody help .
is there somebody there ?
rocky mountain rescue .
come in .
thank god .
we' re stranded .
we were hiking and lost our way .
the weather came in fast .
how many people in your party ?
five .
i don' t know where we are .
by a cylindrical rock formation .
it' s got to be comb bluff .
we can' t get a chopper up there .
we' re on our way .
please hurry .
billy' s in shock .
we need insulin .
please , hurry .
we need insulin .
would you have thought of that ?
five climbers are stranded on comb bluff .
hal' s gone up alone .
hal' s a good climber .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
he can handle it .
if he gets socked in by the weather , they' il never make it down .
he needs someone to help him .
it' s not me he wants help from .
those people need help .
what if he can' t do it alone ?
i haven' t climbed in months .
you' ve lost your nerve .
i didn' t mean that .
it' s okay .
you don' t want the responsibility anymore , but he was your friend .
he took the west ridge .
if you take the north face , you can beat him .
don' t you feel anything anymore ?
feel anything ?
jessie , i came back for you .
it' s not about me , it' s about you .
if you leave , you' il be stuck on that ledge all your life .
where the hell is that plane ?
she went down in the storm .
the storm' s still building .
it' s impossible to see anything .
what about roads ?
there aren' t any roads .
mr. wright , these men are fbl .
agents hayes and michaels .
if it' s about your agent , i' ve got nothing to tell you .
matheson was on surveillance .
surveillance of what ?
there have been reports of treasury jets being monitored .
we thought it was an inside job .
you' re suggesting a hijacking ?
i had my best men on that flight .
those cases were monitored .
the currency isn' t exchangeable .
it' s useless for anyone to steal it .
except for this man .
his name is eric qualen .
we' ve been tracking him .
a former military intelligence guy who decided to change sides .
industrial espionage , diamond smuggling , stolen bearer bonds .
he has the international connections to move this currency . $100 million is a hell of a temptation to him .
what the hell are you doing here ?
jessie filled me in .
well , now let me fill you in .
you take your ass back down to that hole you' ve been hiding in .
let' s get these people down first .
no , you' re out of here now .
did you come up here to prove something ?
i know how you feel about me .
you don' t know anything .
you did it your way ... and she died .
i did what i thought was right .
your weight on the line did it .
there wasn' t any other way .
i guess we' il never know .
it was a bad time for everybody .
what the hell do you know ?
you didn' t love her .
and you didn' t have to look into her eyes when she fell .
now , drop it .
no , buddy .
it was you who dropped it .
you want to do it ?
do it .
no .
you live with it .
they' re here .
right on time .
how many of them are there ?
two .
we' il greet them at the top .
where' s the helicopter ?
what' s going on ?
where' s the helicopter ?
it can' t fly in this weather .
are you chopper pilots ?
no .
what are your names ?
tucker and walker .
we' re missing three bags .
what' s in them ?
none of your business !
socks and $100 million .
the usual stuff .
travers has a tracking device .
don' t use my name , damn it !
key it .
look at the map .
those are our belongings .
the red dots are the three cases .
do you recognise these locations ?
if you don' t , you' re useless .
useless items are discarded .
right , travers ?
get off my back , qualen .
off ?
i haven' t even got on it yet .
do you recognise these locations ?
ryan .
yeah , we do .
then let' s go .
wait a minute , asshole !
where is it ?
up there .
this is rescue centre .
come in , hal .
you' re hal ?
you , stay .
you ... ... fetch !
fetch !
do it .
rescue 1 , do you copy ?
hal , come in , over .
watch yourself under the overhang .
when you feel like talking , don' t .
we' re waiting .
i need my bolt gun and ice axe .
no .
take his coat for insurance .
he could freeze to death .
you' ve got your own problems , hal .
ryan , get a rope .
i want this dog on a leash .
tie it .
it' d better hold .
forget me .
get away .
would you ?
go fetch , wonder dog .
move it , walker .
ryan , keep it taut .
hal , come in .
i don' t trust him .
damn !
i don' t think we need two guides .
retire him when he comes down .
they' re gonna kill you !
pull the rope !
pull , goddamn it !
pull it .
pull , goddamn it .
watch it !
get him .
no !
your friend just had the most expensive funeral in history .
come in , rescue unit .
what' s going on , hal ?
talk .
no messages , no codes , no tricks .
you haven' t found us .
it was a fake call .
i' ve reached the top of the tower .
there' s no sign of anyone .
it looks like a phoney call .
you' re kidding .
do you want me to fly up after you ?
no , the winds are still too high .
i' il ride out the storm up here .
we' il shelter at douglas ...
i' m losing you .
come in , hal .
we go on to the next case .
he said the tower , but he' s on comb bluff .
fly me to the west valley .
the winds are never strong there .
he' s headed for the douglas shaft .
that is a bad idea .
if i don' t find him , come and pick me up by nightfall .
hal would have my head .
it' s such a handsome head .
please , frank .
i' il buy one of your paintings .
hold up !
where is it ?
there .
on top of the peak .
hold it .
that looks like a winding route to me .
the fastest route is the east face .
only 12 guys in the world can do it .
you want to try it ?
gabe !
what' s happened ?
you' re frozen .
where' s your pack and sweater ?
they got hal .
it was a fake call .
what do you mean ?
before they crashed they dumped cases of money .
who' s they ?
they' re using hal to find them .
when they do , he' s dead .
you' ve got to call frank .
tell him to call the state police .
the cold killed my radio , but frank will be looking for me .
the sun goes down in an hour .
what should i do ?
pack everything we need .
we' ve got to get to that next case .
we' re close .
it' s just up there .
it better be .
i' m getting tired of your threats .
are you ?
there .
what do we do now ?
have you got a pencil ?
over here .
want to trade ?
that son of a bitch is still alive .
i' m beginning to dislike this mr. walker .
he can' t be far .
find him .
go .
give me a flare .
meet me in eagle' s cave .
gravity is a bitch , isn' t it ?
fuck the money and fuck you .
i wasn' t born to die out here .
where were you born to die ?
i don' t need your shit , boy .
you' ve got a big mouth .
stop this .
the fight' s not here , it' s there .
find us some shelter .
next time you' re watching mtv , flip it to the weather channel .
i mean , where would you rather be ?
here or playing some air hockey ?
air hockey has got my vote .
exactly , cheesehead .
cheesehead ?
he was here .
what was in there ?
answer the man .
nothing , just tourist souvenirs .
or equipment for your friend .
he' s not my friend .
i don' t like him any more than i do you .
nice try , but i never underestimate the power of natural loyalty .
not like the kind that has to be paid for .
make a fire .
it costs a fortune to heat this place .
that' s bad humour , i know .
get some sleep .
we' re going to need it .
rescue units , come in .
do you read ?
what the hell is going on up there ?
jessie , do you read ?
jessie !
we' re drawing a crowd .
before the whole world shows up we' d better find the next one .
it' s on the tower .
how far ?
he asked how far , goddamn it !
we' ve been taking the scenic route .
how far is it ?
half a day .
check it out .
it' s hal .
are you stuck up here , too ?
walk over .
christ , they' re just kids .
we' re not animals .
don' t force us to be .
walk over .
that storm was a real bummer .
we went tent city last night .
we' re going to take one last jump .
are you baby sitting hikers ?
run !
get the hell out of here .
get him .
you son of a bitch !
you didn' t have to kill them .
sue me .
shoot him , damn it !
don' t let him get away .
you murdering motherfucker .
kill a few , you' re a murderer .
kill a million , you' re a conqueror .
go figure .
move on , tucker .
time is short .
just like you said .
he' s taking them the long way round .
we have to go through there .
you said there was a way across .
where the fuck is it ?
there .
are you blind ?
the hell with the money .
radio the chopper .
you just don' t get it , do you ?
we' re partners in crime .
you' ve crossed over , travers .
there' s no crossing back .
that' il keep it dry .
let' s do it .
get a good footing .
it' s slick , jess .
good foothold .
jessie , don' t move .
my god !
let' s get out of here .
no !
jessie , get down .
hold on to me .
it' s on my back .
i' ve got him .
there' s one on my back .
there' s nothing on your back .
rocky mountain centre , this is rescue 3 .
rescue centre , go ahead .
visibility is good .
if anyone is out here , i' il find them .
roger , 3 .
centre out .
i' ve picked up a signal on the thermal imager near comb bluff .
get out of here !
get out !
jesus christ !
here , i' ve got you .
there' s the opening .
i' il hook up the line , and you follow me up .
the other one is following .
i' il flank him .
don' t kill him till you get the money .
we' ve got the id on the dead pilot .
he was known to fly for qualen .
what about the treasury jet ?
the wreckage is scattered .
finally .
a satellite has located the aircraft .
head 110 miles south southwest of the park entrance .
treasury control , get the rescue people on their way .
i' ve got it , jess .
we' re almost out .
i can chop through .
jessie , come on up .
walker , small world , ain' t it ?
don' t even think about it .
your life' s on sale . $30 million .
where is it ?
it' s gone .
where the fuck is the money ?
i burnt it .
i never could save up .
not even a dumb mountain boy like you would burn $30 million .
i' il make a deal with you .
hand over the money and i' il just kill you and not the girl .
give me the money !
gabe ?
come on .
can you walk ?
kynette , where' s the money ?
he said he torched it .
where is he now ?
in a cave .
you' ve had your chance .
kristel , get the c 4 .
just give me five minutes .
get the fuck out of there .
good .
blow up that black bastard while you' re at it .
if you want me , i' m in here .
i' m in here .
i' m in here .
you' re making it too easy for me .
no bullets , bitch .
where' s the money ?
cissy .
you hit like a cissy .
wrong answer , motherfucker .
get up .
where is the money ?
i burnt it .
wrong answer .
time to kill a mountain man .
it amazes me
that a man would put money before the personal safety
of himself and his bitch .
you can go to your grave knowing
that i' m going to treat the bitch right !
are you okay ?
god !
i thought he' d killed you .
are you okay ?
jessie , do you read ?
do you read ?
what the hell' s going on ?
find it .
it' s ready .
rescue 1 , do you copy ?
over .
here it is .
i found evan in the east valley .
he' s got a gunshot wound .
he' s en route to the medical centre .
in case you can hear this , i' m resuming my search .
you' il make a fine wife .
you should see me bake a cake .
he' s still alive ... for another four minutes .
where is it set ?
right over his head .
gabe , there' s a bomb .
get out of there .
jessie , get the gear .
that charge may cause a landslide .
we' ve got to get to the west face .
why are we wasting time ?
he' s not getting that last case .
you want to kill me , don' t you ?
well , take a number and get in line .
tie this together , we' re going to rappel down .
this rope is old , will it hold ?
i don' t think so .
frank !
he can' t see you .
go .
here comes our ride .
move .
swing as hard as you can .
push .
jump .
frank ...
what' s happening here ?
welcome .
what are you doing ?
back off .
i came here to help you .
dumb move .
frank .
you' d better hurry , tucker .
get the hell out of here !
maniac !
no one told you to shoot .
we' ve wasted enough time .
i' m sorry .
this man never hurt anybody .
touching .
kristel , check the chopper .
get back !
jessie , run !
that son of a bitch .
we use the chopper to locate the third case , then we' re gone .
no , there' s only enough fuel to get us down .
you' re not running things , travers .
as soon as he finds the money , you' re as dead as me .
give me the monitor .
now .
enter code
what' s the code ?
there are 50, 000 possibilities in 1 5 second intervals .
what' s the fucking code ?
look what agent travers has found .
i guess he is running things now .
so what' s the plan ?
use the chopper to find the money ?
good idea .
but then ... ... without a pilot ... ... nobody even gets off this mountain .
what are you doing , eric ?
do you know what real love is ?
no .
sacrifice .
now i' m the only one who can fly us out of here .
now take your toy and find our money .
radio when you find it .
i' m waiting here .
the last one is at crockett river .
we take the northern ridge .
i' m going to take the north trail and you' re going back for help .
are you crazy ?
if they find the case , hal' s dead .
where are the choppers ?
they had a mechanical problem .
their eta is one hour .
you' ve got to do better than that .
stop there .
we' re close .
i' ve locked in .
i' d say we' ve finished with him .
yeah , but do it quietly .
your insane boss has already made enough noise .
it' s been fun .
you' re an asshole .
and you' re a loud mouthed , punk slag who' s about to die .
maybe .
but in a minute i' il be dead , and you will always be an asshole .
go ahead and shoot .
i' m getting cold .
shoot .
who' s shooting ?
tell me ... do you like soccer ?
it' s a great sport .
i was a fucking good striker .
here' s an outside right .
fuck you !
you' re swearing now .
that' s a penalty kick for unsportsmanlike conduct .
a lovely little chip shot .
he' s passed one defender ...
two defenders ...
three defenders ...
the striker lines up for a penalty .
he focuses on the ball .
the crowd is on its feet .
the striker moves to his left .
he draws back his foot .
he comes in .
season' s over , asshole .
i said quietly .
enter code
what the fuck is going on ?
this is not right .
fuck !
