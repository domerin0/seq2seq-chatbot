pharmacist chol hee chul .

i' m on my way to propose to someone .
this very important ring mistakenly fell down ...

yongkang station
how will i ever find him here ?
chol hee chul ?
hee chul ?
hee chul ?
you know him ?
isn' t that the hee chul at yongkang pharmacy ?
yeah , that' s him .
you mean the mayor' s son .
if it' s the mayor' s son , then isn' t he your son' s friend ?
of course he' s friends with my young deuk .
hee chul was the top student , young deuk was the top bully ?
there you go again with your crap !
did i say something wrong ?
your son ripped hee chul' s forehead and his grandma went nuts .
that' s right , hee chul' s grandma adored him .
sons are precious in that family .
his mother wanted to have a son , so she borrowed my panties for luck .
are you serious ?
don' t you remember ?
excuse me .
all they have is one child ?
no .
they have a daughter , too .
his mother had her and passed away .
yeah , right after i had my man suk .
it' s been twenty years already !
yeah , now i remember .
hee chul' s grandma was hoping for another son .
but after his weak mother died , the town scolded the grandma .
the town didn' t know anything .
yeah , she was so good to hee chul' s mom .
that' s right .
ladies ?
anyway , how do you all know so much ?
this town is so small , we can count all the spoons , right ?
so what about hee chul ?
yes ?
i didn' t see hee chul at the drug store just now .
why don' t you go directly to the mayor' s home instead ?
i' ve been a taxi driver in this town for ten years .
but i' ve never seen a pretty girl like you .
you could be an actress .
nice skin , pretty legs .
all kinds of people are pissing me off today .
so where can i take you , princess ?
to the mayor' s home .
why are you going to the mayor' s home ?
i' m gonna be his new daughter in law .
wait just one moment .
what can i do for you ?
i came to find chol hee chul .
hee chul ?
you' re too late .
hee chul died a year ago .
today' s his memorial .
is this some horror flick ?
excuse me .
you said you came for hee chul ?
actually , what happened with this ring ...
hee chul isn' t here right now .
but hee chul' s father is at the drug store now .
i' m hee chul' s aunt .
what can i do for you ?
mother , i' m your third son in law .
goodness , you' re too late .
my third son in law died last year .
oh , mother .
we have a guest .
she' s a bit senile .
honey , hurry and take her to the drug store .
so you' re dating my son , hee chul ?
pardon ?
well , it' s not what it seems .
go on with your business .
hey !
if it' s not what it seems , then why do you have this ring ?
it' s a bit complicated to explain .
just think of it as a ring i picked up ,
so please call ...
picked up ?
this ring ?
i think you' ve misunderstood .
actually , i' m not in a position to tell you exactly what happened .
aren' t you going home ?
darn door handle .
oh , i see you have a guest .
miss .
you appear out of the blue .
you bring this wedding ring , and you talk about my son .
shouldn' t you explain exactly , so that i can fully understand ?
you' re right , but ...
what happened , you see ...
well , to tell you the truth ,
i didn' t meet your son on good terms .
it' s partially my fault ,
but he made a mistake to ...
mistake ?
no , i mean , to put it simply ,
i just wanna return this ring .
i couldn' t reach him , so i came all the way here .
wait , it sounds as if our hee chul did something wrong to you .
why ?
pardon ?
from what you said , my son is making some big mistake .
isn' t that what you' re implying ?
no , that' s not what i mean .
looks like a new face to me .
who the heck is this girl ?
how did you meet my boy ?
who are you , miss ?
you' re all so mean .
don' t ask me anything anymore .
how are you ?
i' m so glad to meet you .
i' ve heard a lot about you from hee chul .
what' s wrong with her ?
officer kim !
bring the stretcher !
yes , sir .
why isn' t the door opening ?
the door usually opens from the outside in a police car .
open the door !
so hee chul said she' s his girlfriend ?
i don' t know exactly .
come on and tell me .
then whose girl would it be ?
his dad' s ?
happy birthday to you !
happy birthday to you !
happy birthday , dear jae eun !
happy birthday to you !
happy birthday , jae eun .
i don' t know everything .
just that he mentioned her a few times not long ago .
what makes you sure it' s her ?
mom' s ring .
actually , hee chul had it for a long time .
you know how corny he can be .
he was going to propose with it .
you must be so happy .
you always said you wanted a daughter in law .
go see how she is .
i should' ve just finished my time .
marriage fraud on parole ?
it' s getting worse by the minute .
i' m looking after the patient that just left .
i swear she said that she' il be his daughter in law .
really ?
i' m serious .
anyway , why did she faint ?
wait a minute !
at three months , it' s important to be careful .
to avoid a miscarriage , meals must be eaten regularly .
what did you say ?
oh goodness , then it all fits .
in other words , hee chul did that to that girl .
then she became that way , and ...
you' re right .
so hee chul made a mistake first .
and she said it was partially her fault .
but regardless , that rotten hee chul ...
for you ,
i lack readiness .
for you , i lack appearance .
for you ,
i lack courage .
for you , i lack life .
i ...
but i pray i can be only for you .
with this ring ...
our family is a bit peculiar .
whenever something comes up , we all rush in like that , and take the wind out of people .
yeah , they seem a bit different .
but other families are very envious of us .
you know , city people aren' t like that .
i guess you' re right .
yes ?
i bet you' re very uncomfortable .
i' m okay .
i' m sorry about today .
since you came to see hee chul anyway , feel at home and we' il talk when he comes back .
now .
get some rest .
yes , good night , father .
father ?
father ?
a bastard like me shouldn' t be alive , right ?
someone who plans to propose
loses the ring .
that' s me .
why me ?
anyway , do you think jae eun' s mad ?
her face looked pissed off .
no way .
she left smiling .
actually , it was fun .
isn' t it yours ?
you got a call .
where ?
who the hell' s calling ?
hello ?
yes , sir .
yes , hello .
one moment .
hey , it' s your dad .
it' s me , father .
where are you now ?
i' m still in busan .
you have a girlfriend ?
how did you know that ?
when will you be back ?
well , i still have some things to do .
you' re hiding out , aren' t you ?
sir ?
i' il keep this short !
come back tomorrow !
yes , sir ...
hiding out ?
what are you talking about ?
we have to hold her here no matter what .
what if she goes and have an abortion ?
then we' ve committed a sin .
no , i won' t see it .
like he said , we must hold her here by all means .
hurry outside .
go home and get some rest .
you did great today .
boy , i' m exhausted .
what a day , huh ?
she' s pretty , huh ?
very pretty .
why do i feel so worn out ?
over that ?
it all worked out anyway .
he can marry hee chul off and have grandkids .
it certainly is a blessing .
i wish mother can hug a great grandchild soon .
want another kid ?
be quiet .
hurry and hop in .
okay .
long , long , time ago , there lived sun boy and moon girl .
but a tiger tried to eat them .
as sun boy and moon girl tried to run away , a rope suddenly fell from the sky .
sun boy and moon girl went up on the rope .
damn it , this is a long story .
the tiger fell and died .
so what happened next ?
sis !
yes ?
it' s soo mi .
yes , one sec ' .
what' s wrong with your voice ?
are you in pain ?
no !
oh , what a hot night .
i thought you' d be here longer .
going back for the ring ?
no , my father told me to hurry and come back .
you' re so sweet .
i' m not sweet .
i' m stupid .
anyway ...
have you thought about it ?
about coming down to yongkang .
you' re talking about yongkang again ?
your proposal didn' t mean that we were going to apply for seoul hospital together ?
of course , it does .
just that there' s nice weather , the scenery' s nice , and ...
it' il freshen up your head a bit .
i' il go .
where ?
yongkang .
i' il go as soon as possible .
hey , what' s with you ?
since you answered so easily , it sounds like a lie .
the mayor is so lucky .
fate brought her here .
he longed for a daughter in law .
fate works in wonders .
you' re right .
he likes her more because she' s pretty .
help yourself to plenty .
thank you very much , father .
goodness , she said father .
yes .
thank you , father .
say your welcome to your daughter in law .
are you all having a party ?
you don' t even know the whole story .
then ...
i heard you wanted to go to a spa .
yes ?
i just mentioned that you wanted a bath .
there' s a famous spa here .
no , i didn' t really mean it .
usually , you' re supposed to go with the in laws .
that way you' il get close faster .
yes , hee chul will take a while , so let' s go to the spa .
but i don' t feel so well .
yeah , it is far though .
it' il only take 15 minutes by car .
a new spa opened by the bus terminal .
who goes to the spa with in laws lately ?
it was only during our time .
i' il go to the spa !
i want to take grandmother and go with the family .
wonderful !
be careful !
please watch your step !
you should' ve held her !
stop overreacting .
let' s go in .
does hee chul know what state your body' s in ?
no , not yet .
why didn' t you tell him ?
that' s how you seize his heart .
i see .
where' s the restroom ?
want me to go with you ?
i' il just go on my ...
no , you must be extra careful at this time .
soo mi !
go with her to the restroom .
okay .
no , i' il just change here .
so why did they go to the spa all of a sudden ?
hee chul .
yes ?
i' m very disappointed in you .
what ?
i' m telling you this now that you' ve grown up .
before i married your aunt , i had many women all over me .
but do you know why i married your aunt ?
no .
she was carrying a baby like you are now , you fool .
auntie is carrying my baby ?
welcome !
attention customers !
looking for mister chol hee chul' s fiancee .
mister chol hee chul' s fiancee . please come to the reception desk . she' s impersonating as my fiancee ,
i tell you i' m on the air , damn it !
what' s this noise ?
i don' t know .
where did she go ?
that woman ...
welcome !
you !
it' s you from the train , right ?
i' ve finally found you .
but what are you doing here ?
it' s all because of that darn ring .
i don' t have time to ...
ring ?
how did you ...
wait , then you' re the one
who' s swindling as my fiancee .
swindling ?
don' t screw with me , and just give me my bag .
now i see that you stole my ring .
your ring is with your father .
just tell me where my ...
know what happened to me because of you ?
why' d you steal my ring ?
are you done talking ?
no !
what did i do to you to deserve this ?
now i see that you hitting me was all an act .
i see you' re a real pro !
a pro !
i warned you , didn' t ?
do you know you' re screwing with me ?
i screwed with you , so what ?
is screwing with you that important now ?
after what happened to me ,
does it matter that i screw ...
you rotten bastard !
are you that proud of screwing a girl ?
is that what i taught you ?
i swear i don' t know her .
father , i' m your son !
you' ve raised me for over twenty years .
don' t you trust me ?
then why is she doing this ?
that' s what i want to know , too .
hey you !
why the hell are you doing this ?
how can she talk if you bully her like that ?
don' t you know she' s expecting ?
this is driving me nuts .
uncle .
shouldn' t you sense that something' s wrong ?
well , you could have a point .
well , but it does seem like there' s some reason we don' t know .
everything is all my fault .
if i hadn' t showed up ,
i wouldn' t have caused any trouble .
yes .
like hee chul said ,
i' ve lied .
see ?
i told you so .
i told you so .
frankly , i' m not the girl from hee chul' s pharmaceutical school .
but my love for hee chul was true .
actually , i didn' t go to college .
even when i heard that hee chul was seeing his classmate ,
i couldn' t say anything , knowing i couldn' t compete .
i prayed that he' d come back , but he cut me off entirely .
rotten bastard .
uncle .
i' m very sorry .
i just wanted to return the ring , and not mention these things .
although it was brief , you all were so good to me .
i' m sorry to disappoint you .
sit back down .
it' s okay , father .
father ?
sit down .
yes , sir .
i' m not saying this because i don' t trust you .
i' m just asking this because i need to know for sure .
can you tell us whatever you know about hee chul ?
yeah !
great idea , father !
how about this instead ?
ask for her ld number and find out who she really is !
what do you think , uncle ?
are we interrogating a criminal ?
are we ?
idiot !
hee chul , do i have to do this ?
be frank and say that you don' t know .
how would you know when we only met once on the train ?
hee chul always said this like a habit .
that he' s a precious son .
when did i say that ?
since there was only one son for every generation ,
hee chul' s mother went through so much trying to bear hee chul .
hee chul' s mother did everything possible .
she even borrowed panties from a woman who bore many sons .
he said that his mother went through so much to bear him .
his grandmother was so good to his mother .
after she passed away bearing soo mi ,
hee chul' s grandmother was very misunderstood .
poor girl !
poor girl ...
grandma , please stop crying .
this is impossible !
father !
aunt ...
soo mi , you told her , didn' t you ?
this is fishy .
she has to talk about me !
say something about me , okay ?
hee chul was a good student .
to be frank , hee chul brags too much .
sometimes i think he' s poking fun at me .
uncle !
one time he bragged so much he got into a fight .
his name was young ... something .
young deuk .
that' s right .
i don' t need to see it to know .
he probably got hit after bragging about his grades .
that gave him the scar on his forehead .
that' s why his grandmother went into a frenzy .
you still call her a fraud after that ?
how did you know that ?
you rotten bastard !
punish me instead , father !
hee chul keeps insisting on an abortion .
but i can' t do it alone .
i' m sorry , father !
what ?
you rotten bastard !
i told you not to screw with me , didn' t i ?
how did you first meet hee chul ?
well ...
was it a sunny day ?
or a rainy day ?
it did seem to have snowed .
anyway , i was drinking tea .
i think hee chul was using the phone .
oh my !
i don' t care about a measly wallet .
thanks to you , i' ve gained a precious encounter .
i run a drug store in yongkang .
a pharmacist .
i' m chol hee chul .
how slimy .
that' s really how you met him ?
think slimy was all ?
i learned a lesson then .
don' t ever jump into someone else' s business .
love is so strange , considering what can be overcome .
don' t you think ?
so what work do you do now ?
i' m taking a rest .
then what did you do before ?
i was just ...
i worked for a certain government organization .
so you' ve come on your own feet .
now i don' t have to climb in through the window .
didn' t you hear my father say not to even step into the house ?
why is my father your father ?
who says so ?
from what i know , he' s not your father after today .
it' s just the two of us , so why don' t we be frank .
what do you want ?
my bag .
your bag ?
because i' m in a certain bind , i can' t either stay or go .
it' s a real drag to be here , you know ?
you remember my bag , right ?
what would i know about your bag ?
did you leave it with me ?
how could you say that ?
i went to retrieve your ring , but i' m paying for it now .
so shouldn' t you try to remember at least ?
oh yeah , the ring .
i don' t know how precious that crappy bag was , that ring was on that day ?
that crappy bag ?
yeah !
that crappy bag with the ragged handle .
all i need to do is buy you a new bag .
but how will you make up for what' s happened to me ?
so you don' t know where it is ?
you don' t even know what was inside it .
that crappy bag ?
fine .
i' il wait here until you find it .
i don' t have any place to go anyway .
how dare you ?
are you threatening me ?
oh boy , i can' t wait to see what happens !
you have no sense at all !
you beast !
how could you hit a woman ?
you' re a beast !
die , you beast !
i' m hungry .
stay for a long , long time , okay ?
yes , grandma .
hello !
going to work ?
yes .
are you preparing well for the contest ?
of course .
no matter what , you have to win for the town , okay ?
yes , don' t worry .
have a nice day !
hi , on your way somewhere ?
i played a lot when i was young , but i never abandoned my wife !
not a single man did well after abandoning his wife !
for your father at least , if you keep acting up ...
that hurt !
cover your stomach when you go to bed .
be a nice boy .
promise me .
lightning will strike you down .
right mom ?
make a woman cry , and lighting will strike you down .
you were right .
she' s really pretty .
i' m so envious .
the books are too old .
they have nothing to look at , so they just play .
last time i estimated , we need 4 million won to fill it up with books .
why do i have to come into my own room like this ?
hey !
wouldn' t someone take this wrong ?
why the hell are you doing this to me ?
find my bag fast .
i don' t have much time either .
why do you think that bag ...
mother !
mother , where are you ?
mother , are you upstairs ?
mother !
