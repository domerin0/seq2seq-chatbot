but do they cover the spread ?
hell no .

let me tell you something .
you can give me simms and bavaro , meggett and l. t. any day .
those guys are your meat and potatoes .
they fucking cover , baby .
and don' t even bring up miami .
don' t .
cause there' s nothing in miami .
miami has nothing but marino with a golden arm and some fat booty cheerleaders .
they have no running game .
it s like two virgins who can' t find the dam hole .
that' s why they get blitzed all the damn time .
you understand ?
i can' t believe you guys , man .
yeah , they put up a ton of points , but they cover every other week .
so take the over and bet the fucking farm .
you understand ?
the pigs , the barn , the little chickens and that tractor .
bet all of that .
dallas , america s team , my sweet black ass .
come on .
try to book
everybody and their grandmother wanna bet the cowboys .
therefore they gotta win by two touchdowns just to cover .
and what are the odds on that happening ?
so dome a favor .
take the points and run .
come on , guys .
allright ?
unless you are a moron , retarded saints fan .
therefore you deserve to get cornholed on the 50 yard line .
america' s sport , baby football .

let s see that ten million dollar red beauty , baby !

the surgeon general was right !

the psychodynamics of compulsive stealing are well established .
an act committed to relieve a pre existing state of guilt .
an attempt to harm an imagined enemy or a form of revenge ...
against those who have deprived the person of something significant ... or somehow inficted a narcissistic injury .
but stealing panties from the girls ' locker room , there s nothing in there .
i' ve never really been a big fan of freud' s anyway .
i don' t know if i should say this , i' m a professional .
i won' t say anything .
you promise to keep your word ?
okay .
you know that thing that you were doing with the panties ?
everybody does it .
your best friends do it .
the mailman , the headmaster .
they all whack off .
and if anybody tells you they don' t , they' re lying .
my momsays i' m
she says i' m oversexed .
now you' re dead !
hello ?
hi , daddy .
hello .
excuse me .
who am i speaking to ?
this is me .
no , my jessie is eight .
the girl i' m talking to is at least 11 .
can i speak to your mother , please ?
mom .
don' t forget the turkey .
why don t you have them deliver it ?
it' s thanks giving eve , nathan .
you might as well get the bird to fly here .
all right , okay .
fairway , right ?
what' s the cross street , 74th ?
the man' s a steel trap .
i will be there in ten minutes .
bye .
go away .
come on .
shit !
louis ?
this better be a real emergency .
ah , my hero !
look .
she' s not one of your dalton trust fund waifs , but she needs your help .
i don' t know .
i don' t talk to you for days .
then the night before thanks giving
jesus christ .
lucky guy' s still alive .
she took a razor to this orderly up in rockland . 111 stitches to close him up .
what was the trigger ? good question .
been in and out of institutions for ten years .
i see that .
selective mutism , obsessive compulsive behavior , post traumatic symptoms .
twenty different hospitalizations , twenty different diagnoses .
plus an i. q off the charts .
apparently saw her father killed by a subway when she was eight .
dr. sachs ?
what ?
the girl who was biting the heads off pigeons , she has a med student in a headlock .
call security .
make sure the student documents the attack and gets it co signed .
louis , i don' t know what the hell you want from me .
i got a family home waiting .
nathan , spend 15 minutes with her .
she' s an 18 year old girl , never hurt a fly until last week .
you and i are the only thing that stands between her and a lifetime of thorazine or worse .
wait !
what do you mean , you and i , " kemo sabe ?
she' s your patient .
you' re an asshole .
okay ?
you' re a big asshole for making me say this .
you' re better at this stuff than i am , okay ?
you' re better , you' re better .
everybody knows about nathan conrad and the famous touch with the teens .
elisabeth burrows .
this is the kind of case you and i used to live for !
before you went uptown on me .
just kidding .
i didn' t mean it that way .
look .
she needs you .
all right , she needs me .
but what' s the emergency ?
why tonight ?
if we don' t make some progress by monday , they' re gonna ship her to creedmore ... and chain her to a bed for the rest of her natural life .
that' s why .
that' s why she needs you now .
five minutes .
five minutes !
arnie , frankie , good evening .
dr. conrad , are you slumming tonight ?
afraid so .
you guys up for a cavity search ?
i' il pass .
but dr. sachs , he' s always ready for one .
on the gate .
what' s the new cocktail ?
haldol , droperidol and ativan .
and she' s awake ?
oh , yes , she' s awake .
he told me to stay .
come on , sweetheart .
is she eating ?
not eating , drinking , sleeping , bathing , letting anybody touch her ... or saying a word .
dr. sachs , he told me to stay .
i' il have a word with him .
i promise , louise .
i promise .
what' s with the heavy artillery ?
well , it took about five guys to get her off the poor fellow at rockland .
is there anything else you want to tell me ?
no .
no .
no .
would you open the door , please ?
are you okay ?
am i okay ?
yeah .
i' m okay .
hello .
elisabeth , my name is dr. conrad .
i' m a psychiatrist .
word has it that you haven' t eaten for days .
well , i can understand that .
i used to work in this hospital .
i know what the food' s like .
elisabeth , would you mind if i took your pulse ?
that means i' m gonna have to touch you .
now that' s not supposed to happen .
true catatonics have what' s called a waxy fexibility of their limbs .
that means they stay exactly where they' re posed .
there' s more to you than meets the eye , elisabeth .
you' re very , very good at what you do .
so is there anything you want to talk about ?
well , that' s okay .
we hardly know each other .
i know you must have been very frightened to do what you did to that guy .
i know that you were angry , because i saw those photos .
but i also know that you re in a lot of pain .
because nobody' s in this place without a reason .
so maybe we' il talk next week .
you want what they want .
don' t you ?
what who wants ?
elisabeth , what who wants ?
any of you .
any of you .
any of you .
h hello ?
who are you ?
five to three , this old bag doesn' t have cable .
i need my sports center .
dinner' s over !
how you doin ' , tony ?
good .
how you doin ' ?
nice to see you again .
you too .
hello !
this certainly looks like the conrad residence .
it smells like the conrad residence .
and it is definitely overheated ...
like the conrad residence .
but it doesn' t sound like the conrad residence .
hi , honey .
i' m looking for a little girl ... about four feet two , light brown hair .
huh .
where did she go ?
well , if i don' t find that little girl ,
i' m gonna have to go downstairs and find myself another little girl .
i' il be back in ten minutes .
hi !
hi , daddy .
how are you ?
look what i did in art class today .
that' s beautiful .
look at the colors .
you got such a unique vision .
it' s my vision , i swear .
aren' t you supposed to be in bed ?
i can' t sleep .
i have mental problems .
i see .
what kind of mental problems ?
i' m highly neurotic .
you' ve been in my study again .
i needed the stapler .
go say good night to mom .
you' re late .
night , mommy .
night , baby .
did you brush your teeth ?
can i smell ?
yeah .
mmm , delicious .
i' m gonna put monkey by you on that side , and i' il put sally over here to keep you company .
you had a bad day .
why do you say that ?
frown face !
if i had a frown face , it' s because it' s after 10 : 00 and you' re still awake .
where were you tonight ?
i was working .
why ?
because i was helping a young girl .
all right , but that' s gonna cost ya .
all right , what' s it gonna be ?
one hug ... two kisses .
two kisses ?
boy , you cut a tough deal .
okay .
here' s one hug .
mmmmm .
and one kiss .
and two kisses .
will they put bart simpson in the parade tomorrow ?
they will put bart simpson in the parade if you go to sleep right now .
okay , but i don' t think they' il care if i go to sleep or not .
good night , sweetheart .
i love you .
i love you too .
let me give you a hand , detective .
thanks .
that' s beautiful .
what exactly is beautiful ?
your jacket , the leatherjacket .
it s beautiful .
right .
did you read about the manhattan bridge ?
no .
actually , it was builtwrong , moves ten feet .
but it' s still standing .
syd simon .
i' il see you later .
detective cassidy .
what can i do for you ?
what have we got ?
floater , female , no i. d.
she' s maybe in her 20s .
the sloughing of her skin tells me she' s been in the water maybe two , three days .
this time of year with the water cold ?
could be longer .
couple , three days tops .
her hands have been tied .
they recover any rope or anything ?
they' re still looking .
another body was found , a couple days ago .
battery park area .
yeah .
victim was male , middle aged .
day before yesterday .
all right .
i' m gonna need preliminary findings by tonight .
dream on , detective .
i got six , seven cases piled up .
syd , i got important doings planned for thanks giving .
do me right , all right ?
tomorrow' s the best i can do .
thank you .
first thing though .
cars have been towed , the roads plowed , so the annual turkey trot
you can' t be distracted .
here you are .
immobile ,
totally exposed ... and quite vulnerable .
i think you need a bath .
guess what , sweetie ?
what ?
i already had a bath .
you did ?
ah , well , you didn' t have ... the nathan conrad fantastic special bath , did you ?
no .
no , you didn' t do that .
i didn' t get that one yet .
pretty hot ?
not too hot , is it ?
no , it' s nice .
oh , good .
i didn' t know a thing about my legacy
when i feel like you were there for me
we should keep it down .
you' re the one that makes the noise .
prepare to die of delight !
jessie , come on .
let' s join the downhill racer .
i heard that about the " downhill racer .
you were dreaming .
i didn' t say anything .
it was icy , you know ?
i know it was , baby .
and very windy too .
it was a hell ride .
good morning .
morning .
you think she' s still sleeping ?
i don' t know .
jessie ?
jessie , come on .
the parade' s gonna start soon .
all right , i' m gonna go there all by myself .
see all those foats alone .
jessie , come on .
breakfast is getting cold .
does she have a new hiding place that i don' t know about ?
probably .
she' s been running around the house like a wildcat all week .
jessie , get in here right now !
honey , eat it up before it gets cold .
nathan , she wouldn' t go out on the balcony , right ?
she' s not there .
she knows better than to go outside without asking us , doesn' t she ?
jessie , get in here right now !
you get outta here and go home and enjoy your thanks giving .
she lost one of her socks .
what ?
she' s gone .
what do you mean , she s gone " ?
wait
what do you mean , she s gone " ?
wait
somebody came in .
no , no .
she' s in the hallway .
somebody took her .
nobody took her , nathan .
they broke in .
they cut the chain on the door .
what ?
call the police !
i can' t get a dial tone .
get off the line .
this is an emergency .
there' s something wrong with the goddamn phone .
there is nothing wrong with the phone , nathan .
get off , this is an emergency .
i know .
who is this ?
we have your daughter .
what  who is it ?
what' s your worst fear , nathan ?
what are they saying ?
the first shock can buckle the knees .
any truth in that ?
where is she ?
she' s unharmed .
give it to me !
i don' t want to have to hurt her .
i want something from you .
no .
what ?
not until ...
i talk to my daughter , and i know she' s okay .
you do not make demands .
you listen to what i tell you .
you call me back when i can talk to my daughter .
what are you doing ?
aggie .
what the hell are you doing ?
listen to me .
no !
are you crazy ?
listen to me !
no !
no !
aggie , we have to make sure she' s all right .
what if they don' t call back ?
hello ?
daddy ?
jessie , are you okay , sweetie ?
honey , have they hurt you ?
no .
daddy , can i come home now ?
daddy !
jessie !
that was very brave , nathan .
tell me how much money you want !
i don' t want your money .
pick up your wife before she breaks the other leg .
what ?
nathan , what is it ?
don' t close the curtains .
i like the view .
good .
now .
on the bureau by the door is a cell phone .
i know what you' re thinking .
don' t .
by the time you hit the " 1 " in 911, jessie will be dead .
do not try to call or signal anyone .
if you do , i will kill your daughter .
not because i want to , but because those are the rules , do you understand ?
yes .
what ?
i can see you .
i can hear you .
when you leave your building , wherever you go , you will be watched .
so if you want to see your daughter alive , don' t say a word .
now , tell me you understand .
i understand .
good .
you have a probono patient .
her name is elisabeth burrows .
a very disturbed girl .
she has a six digit number in her head , locked away in her troubled mind .
she guards it with her life .
what kind of number ?
that needn' t concern you right now .
i need that number .
you need your daughter back .
that is why this is happening .
you' re a professional , nathan , so am i.
if we both do our jobs to the best of our abilities , by this time tomorrow , it will be like ... we never even knew each other .
now , go back to bridgeview .
take the rover .
no police , no detours .
and , nathan ,
aggie will be fine .
you have until 5 : 00 p . m . today .
let' s do exactly what he says .
nathan , why don' t we just call the police ?
because we can' t .
nathan !
because i believe him .
happy thanksgiving .
asshole .
hey , dr. conrad , aren' t you and jessie hitting the parade ?
she' s got a cold .
no signs of sexual assault .
i see evidence of injury in her neck .
signs of bleeding in the strap muscles overlying her larynx .
i don' t know , syd .
this girl does not match any of my missing persons .
also evidence of a fracture on the left tip of her hyoid bone .
syd , how' d she die ?
no blunt instrument here .
her neck was snapped in two .
by what ?
by two hands .
by two hands .
syd , the same technique used on this battery park foater ?
same dislocation of the skull .
and the splotches on the body ?
cigarette burns .
he was tortured .
thank you .
and he had prison tats .
okay .
i' m gonna need fingerprints and dental x rays on our jane doe , pronto .
you know , this is thanks giving .
you' re right .
you are right .
all right , well , i hope her family isn' t waiting on her to carve the turkey .
cassidy , i' m not susceptible to your " guilting me " bullshit .
she probably helped her mom with the dishes .
fingerprints and dentals .
then i' m the hell outta here .
thank you , syd .
whoa !
come on !
roll down your window , sir .
officer , i' m a doctor .
congratulations .
you happen to notice the tuba player that rolled off your hood ?
i need to get through this parade .
i need an escort to the bridgeview psychiatric hospital right now .
do i look like a freaking helicopter ?
use 57th street .
he' s talking to the cops .
what' il we do ?
be patient .
there' s a young girl who could die , so , officer kreidman , you can either help me save this girl ... or not .
i need two guys .
the two of you .
let' s go .
right over there .
come on , come on .
hold the band .
hold the band right there .
open those gates for me , guys .
son of a bitch .
he just picked up a police escort and cut through the parade .
i like that .
what ?
the police escort .
i like it a lot .
you didn' t tell me the context of the number .
she knows .
look , this girl has a decade of pathology to unravel .
even if she knows , your 5 : 00 deadline is absurd .
in my experience , people are at their best when facing unreasonable deadlines .
you can' t just flick a switch in the girl' s head .
you have to trust me .
it does not work that way in these cases .
look , the money' s bad , i know .
but you have family obligations .
and , nathan , don' t lose the phone .
the doctor has landed .
did he double alarm the car ?
nope .
good .
we' ve got him focused .
do you have the key to dr. sachs' s office ?
yeah .
could you open it , please ?
open it .
but dr. sachs isn' t here .
i thought nathan explained the rules very clearly .
put the cell phone back .
there' s no percentage in breaking those rules .
you sick son of a bitch !
you hurt my little girl and i' il
you' il do what ?
you were about to say something personal .
i think .
no .
that' s good .
if your husband is on his game today , you' ve got nothing to worry about .
there' s a good side to this , aggie .
this will bring you ... much closer than the occasional ski trip ... or sponge bath .
the remote is to your left .
pick it up .
pick it up !
good .
now turn it on .
north carolinais tops
try hbo .
no , i' ve seen this .
bit too violent .
try a nice family drama .
nathan !
what are you doing here ? you' re not supposed to be here .
how' d you get in ?
who let you in ?
you' re supposed to be in greenwich with kim and her family .
why are you here on thanks giving ?
why am i here ?
i gotta testify in a double homicide ... on monday , and i thought i' d come do research .
what ?
you broke into my files !
those are my per i would' ve given you the key , man .
have you gone through all of this ?
well , not all of it .
i just got here .
i' ve been through the master file .
it' s a swamp of misdiagnoses .
i think she' s overlaying .
overlaying ?
louis , she is a brilliant mimic .
that' s why rockland couldn' t figure her out .
she' s highly adaptive .
she takes on the symptoms of other patients .
she' s like a counterfeit schizophrenic , maybe .
come on , i i can' t believe it' s all smoke and mirrors .
that would place her in the malingerer shall of fame .
i gotta believe there' s some sort of genuine pathology beneath it all .
she has classic post traumatic stress symptoms .
her p. t. s. d. is real .
seeing her father die .
that was ground zero .
she also believes that something or somebody is after her .
and that is why she stayed institutionalized these past ten years .
she wants to stay inside .
so 20 different hospitalizations , twenty different diagnoses .
all overlaying .
nathan , that would make her a very , very talented young lady , wouldn' t it ?
or desperate .
louis ?
yeah ?
does anybody know i' m treating elisabeth burrows besides you ?
everybody .
i put it up last night after you left .
figured you might be back .
i wanted you to have clearance in case i wasn' t around .
also reinstated your password .
gate , please !
elisabeth , good morning .
feeling better ?
i brought you something .
a chocolate turkey .
the sugar will help you metabolize all those meds they' ve been giving you .
you like thanks giving ?
it' s my favorite holiday .
wanna touch ?
sorry ?
i saw you looking .
i know what you' re trying to do .
you want to embarrass me .
it won' t work .
the other doctor ?
dr. sachs .
yeah .
i don' t like him .
well , i can understand that .
very fucking funny .
elisabeth , there' s something important i have to ask you .
but first i want to show you something .
i have a daughter .
she' s eight ... going on eighteen .
her name' s jessie .
i have some of her favorite things here .
this is horton hearsa who .
i' ve read it to her so many times , it' s pretty worn by now .
and this .
she loves to draw weird pictures of me .
and this
this is sally .
would you like one of those ?
i' il make sure the hospital lets you keep it .
but you can only choose one .
what the hell is this , toys " r " us ?
want me to choose for you ?
choose ' fore you lose .
for you choose ' fore you lose for you
dr. conrad ?
yes ?
get out .
no .
i want you to leave .
we' re not finished talking , elisabeth .
i know what you' re trying to do .
you wanna embarrass me .
it won' t work .
what' s your name ?
your hair' s really long .
my hair used to be that long , but my mom made me cut it .
what' s that thing on your neck ?
it' s kind of impolite not to answer someone' s question .
it' s a symbol .
what' s it mean ?
no talk .
elisabeth , there' s something i need to know .
jessie .
jessie ?
that' s my little girl' s name .
you wanna see a picture that jessie drew ?
i' il make you a deal .
i' il show you the picture if you answer my question .
is it worth just one answer ?
i don' t mean a " yes " and " no " answer .
maybe .
i' m gonna ask my question now .
is the man that you hurt at rockland
did that have anything to do with the terrible thing ... that happened to you in the subway years ago ?
run , honey , run !
shit !
run , honey , run !
i didn' t know what you were talking about yesterday .
run !
i didn' t know who they were or what they wanted .
leave !
now i do .
i know how bad they wanted it .
i know how important it was for you to hold onto it .
leave !
leave !
leave !
leave !
leave !
leave !
elisabeth
get out !
leave !
leave !
leave !
leave !
go !
thank you .
i' m sorry .
you lost her .
she' s still got the doll , doesn' t she ?
yeah ?
that went well .
look , i can gain her trust , but without more information ...
i' m shooting in the dark .
the answer' s right in front of you .
i have gone through her files !
all right ?
then look closer .
you  nathan ,
it' s 12 : 22 .
i' m sure of one thing .
they would have encountered quite a few venomous species .
check this out .
see how he' s got his tail up ?
he is grumpy .
he gets his stinger back over the top of his head , ready to grab .
whack !
sting !
signora conrad ?
sofia .
sofia , why are you here ?

i broke it .
mr. conrad will fix it .

come on .
all right , suit yourself .
i have to go .
you have to call me back .
you seen this ?
what' s this ?
girl found wandering on hart island .
where' d you find this ?
in her file in your office .
a young girl was found yesterday among the coffins on hart island .
this is around the time that her father died .
i should run this by child services .
could she have been lost or unattended ?
what that' s very bizarre .
on an island in the east river .
i saw sara two days ago .
she was meeting her boyfriend in the village .
maybe she' s still with him .
she could be .
wait one second .
hey , jake .
uh , tray 57, and just her face .
thanks .
yeah , okay .
come on .
it stinks in here .
it smells weird .
i know .
just breathe through your mouth .
i' ve never seen anyone dead before .
you' il do fine , okay ?
i' m gonna get sick .
listen , no one in here is gonna mind .
okay ?
come on .

i' m at the city morgue .
bye .
mmm .
that' s your n. c. i. c. on the guy with the busted neck .
oh , i got a hit .
leon edwards croft .
jesus , what does he have, 15, 20 arrests ?
well , he' s a busy little bad guy .
won' t be missed .
you run him for known associates ?
of course .
am i not a paid professional ?
it' s okay
why would someone do this to sara ?
the guy with the cigarette burns , croft , he was the driver for this crew .
robbery said they hit banks here , jersey , delaware , virginia .
no convictions till ' 91 .
and , three of his friends just capped off a ten year jolt in attica .
patrick barry koster .
he' s the last one that got out .
november 4 .
on november 4 !
did croft rat these guys out ?
i don' t know .
could be payback .
he has no priors .
there is nothing on him .
he came out of nowhere .
there' s nothing .
it' s the only thing he ever got popped for .
guy' s a ghost .
he' s a ghost ?
well , i guess that' s who i need to talk to , then .
thank you .
watch your back .
yeah .
