i could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls
were coming from afar
they were closer now , fernando
every hour , every minute seemed to last eternally
i was so afraid , fernando
we were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
and i' m not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons
almost made me cry ... move it into the pillow .
the pillow forms a perfect sleeping cradle for your head and back .
we all have a different shape to the head and neck .
by sleeping on a pillow that fits perfectly with your shape ...
i' m back . you relieve stress on muscles  you' re terrible , muriel .

i' m gonna go bald and have to eat macrobiotic food !
we' re not talking about radiotherapy .
this is a discreet tumour .
alone .
isolated .
the operation' s all we need for the moment .
for the moment ?
there' s a minor risk of damage to the spinal cord .
what does that mean ?
it means i' m up shit creek , that' s what it means .
silk chantel .
imported .
when' s your big day ?
your wedding day ?
september .
spring . lvory .
what' s your fiance' s name ?
bill .
well , bill' s in for a big surprise .
will your mother be coming to see the dress ?
no .
no , she can' t .
she' s in hospital .
she' s got a tumour in her spine .
she has to have an operation .
we don' t usually do this .
but your mother has to see how beautiful you look in that dress .
doing well .
isn' t she doing well , mariel ?
you' re doing really well .
now this foot forward .
you can do it .
good .
now the other one .
good .
that' s good .
and
i have to sit down .
come on .
i have to sit down !
all right .
i' ve got you .
don' t panic .
swing around .
that' s it .
hand back .
take a break , honey .
you' re doing really well .
how can you stand this ?
you push me around in this chair .
you cook for me .
you even help me dress .
i hate it !
when i lived in porpoise spit , i' d just stay in my room for hours ... and listen to abba songs .
sometimes i' d stay in there all day .
but since i' ve met you and moved to sydney ...
i haven' t listened to one abba song .
it' s because now my life' s as good as an abba song .
it' s as good as " dancing queen .
come off it .
promise me something .
we never go back there .
what do you mean ?
i mean , i can' t go back and live in porpoise spit with mum .
not in a wheelchair , not with her .
you' re gonna walk .
promise we never go back .
i promise .
but you' re gonna walk .
i believe there' s something out there .
yeah .
i' m i' m not a sceptic about it .
i' ve been cheated by you
since i don' t know when too many people have seen it .
there' s been too much documentation .
so i made up my mind
it must come to an end taxi for the rehabilitation centre ?
hang on .
i have to get my smokes .
look at me now okay .
will i ever learn i don' t know how
but i suddenly lose control
there' s a fire within my soul
just one look and i can hear a bell ring
one more look and i forget everything
oh oh oh , mamma mia here i go again
my , my , how can i resist you
mamma mia , does it show again
my , my , just how much i' ve missed you
yes , i' ve been broken hearted
blue since the day we parted
why , why did i ever let you go
mamma mia , now i really know
my , my , i could never let you go
i' ve been angry and sad about things that you do
i can' t count all the times that i' ve told you we' re through
and when you go when you slam the door keep going .
i think you know that you won' t be away too long
you know that i' m not that strong
just one look and i can hear  stop the car !
beautiful .
i hope the photos help your sister out of that coma .
mariel !
what are you doing ?
no nothing .
why didn' t you tell me you were gonna marry tim ?
who ?
tim simms , your fiance the one who wants to shoot you .
now , now , now , now just a minute .
you can' t come in here and threaten brides .
i don' t care how unfortunate you are .
fuck off .
what is going on , mariel ?
i' ve seen your wedding album .
you' ve tried on every dress in sydney .
that doesn' t mean i' m getting married .
what else does it mean ?
i wanna get married .
i' ve always wanted to get married .
if i can get married , it means i' ve changed i' m a new person .
how ?
because who would want to marry me ?
tim simms .
there is no tim simms .
i made him up .
in porpoise spit , no one would even look at me .
but when i came to sydney and became mariel , brice asked me out .
and that proves i' m already different than i was ... and if someone wants to marry me , i' m not her any more .
i' m me .
her ?
muriel !
muriel heslop !
stupid , fat and useless !
i hate her !
i' m not going back to being her again !
why can' t it be me ?
why can' t i be the one ?
have you been in a coma ?
rhonda ?
dad .
if they have a copy of this document , then the option is ... giving you a doctor' s certificate saying you are unfit to testify .
can i have that title deed , paul ?
that' s the one .
we can only assume that victor keinosuke has given them a copy of this deed .
muriel , why' d you do it to me ?
i gave you money .
i got you jobs .
i put her through this secretarial course . $2, 000 for two years , it cost me .
comes out , she can' t even type .
i get her into selling cosmetics .
we all think she' s making a go of it .
turns out she' s robbin ' us blind .
you' re a disgrace , an absolute disgrace !
a are you bill the battler ?
i saw you on tv .
can i please have your autograph ?
me and my dad think that you' re not guilty , bill .
i' ve changed my name to mariel .
good on you , son .
you spread it around .
you can' t stop progress !
you' re comin ' back to porpoise spit with me .
we' il leave in three weeks , once this inquiry crap' s over .
i can' t go back .
i' m a new person .
you' re a thief .
the only reason i never got the coppers onto you is your mother begged me not to .
i want that money back .
i' il get you a job at the leagues club .
i' il arrange a bank loan for you .
you' re going to make up for what you' ve done , muriel .
it' s deidre chambers .
deidre !
deidre !
hey , deidre !
bill !
what a coincidence !
what are you doing in sydney ?
well , my sister lives in sydney .
i' m down for the long weekend .
pull up a chair .
what a coincidence !
my barrister , graham newman .
his two solicitors , and muriel you know about .
hello .
it' s mariel !
we should get back , bill .
victor keinosuke' s testimony starts at 3 : 00 .
that jap bastard !
he' s gonna testify that i took bribes from him .
commissions .
commissions .
i took commissions .
cut through all that red tape for him .
i deserve some sort of acknowledgement .
they' d never have got to build that resort on crown land without me .
it was the crown land that did it .
total overreaction .
there were aboriginals living on it .
the federal police raided the house .
your mother just let them walk in .
she and perry made statements told them i had money problems .
don' t think about it .
of course i had money problems .
she stole most of it .
you need your family around you .
if the feds come near you , don' t you say a word .
are you and deidre together ?
what ?
have you left mum for deidre ?
yes .
we' re in love .
what about mum ?
what happiness has your father had in his life if he doesn' t have me ?
what about mum ?
she' il have you .
you got three weeks .
it' s come back the tumour .
i have to have another operation .
i' m not gonna walk .
but what about your rehabilitation ?
they' re gonna cut my spinal cord , mariel .
mum called .
she wants to take me back to porpoise spit .
i told her i was gonna stay here with you .
head down !
head down !
come on !
come on !
swing it !
blokes with no legs and no arms cut through the water faster than that !
look at that !
you' re going through there like a constipated duck !
look at ' em flopping around all over the place !
burchett , what do you think this is , synchronized swimming ?
water aerobics for geriatrics ?
you' re supposed to be a sprinter !
go !
go !
go !
go !
mariel ?
ken blundell .
how are ya ?
van arkle !
i think we found you a girl .
david van arkle , mariel heslop .
mariel , you' ve probably seen the news about the civil war in south africa .
well , just as the south africans seem to be doing the right thing by the blacks ... the police open fire on a black soccer club , and that is bad news for david .
are you black ?
what ?
i don' t know why i said that .
well , well , it is funny , in a way .
but let' s be honest .
the south africans were never much chop in the pool anyway .
david here is a bit of a freak , really .
and i think that he is gonna get the gold medal ... for the 1, 500 metres in the next olympic games .
mariel , how did you feel when kieren perkins ... took gold for australia at barcelona ?
who ?
kieren perkins .
he' s an australian champion .
now , david' s family ... are willing to do anything to see him fulfil his potential as a champion ... even if it means swimming for another country .
and they' re willing to pay $10, 000 ... to the girl that' il help dave out .
are you from sydney originally ?
what ?
no , porpoise spit .
a and why did you leave there ?
well , because of all the mental things that happened to me .
i got shallow , and my physical being could have been improved ... and as well as my mentality .
what about the black haired one ?
no , she was turkish .
she' s only been in the country five minutes .
now , whoever marries david will have to ... tell the immigration authorities that they' re in love with him .
now there' il be media attention ... so they' il have to live with david in his flat ... for at least four months after the marriage .
i' ve worked out all the details of the romance ... which you and david will have to stick to .
but the most important thing is to convince people ... that you two are really in love .
what about the blonde ?
you didn' t like her .
i' m not so sure now .
now , i think mariel might be ... just what we' re looking for .
well , it' s up to you now , love .
would you find it difficult to lie ?
i could try .
well , don' t rush your decision ... but if you could let us know by tomorrow morning .
you can dance , you can jive
having the time of your life
ooh , see that girl watch that scene
diggin ' the dancing queen
i know you couldn' t have got up onto the altar , but at least she could have asked you to be bridesmaid .
she did .
why didn' t you say yes ?
you could have been on television .
i don' t want to sit up here , mum .
i wanna sit in the corner .
no one' il see you over there .
well , if this is your attitude , i don' t know why you bothered coming .
at least you won' t be in anyone' s way .
rhonda ?
is that you ?
you' re the bridesmaids ?
isn' t it fantastic ?
we always knew mariel' d come good .
she' s in all the papers .
what happened to you ?
i had cancer .
it' s all right .
they cut it out .
i won' t walk again though .
you were so full of life .
i' m not dead , cheryl .
come on .
we better get ready .
mariel' s coming .
you must be so happy for her .
god , she has cancer !
i' m divorcing chook .
i suppose i have you to thank for that .
i hope i can do the same for you one day .
you told me it would be a quick civil ceremony .
ah , it' s good she wanted a church wedding .
it' s romantic .
it looks like you mean it .
all the guests are on her side .
i should have hired you some friends .
the charges don' t surprise me .
the bastards have been out to get me from the beginnin ' .
i just wanted you to know
mariel , are you marrying david for money ?
is this a marriage of convenience , mariel ?
mariel , how long have you and david
your mum' s arriving in sydney by bus because i can' t afford a plane ticket .
you see what you' ve done to me ?
where is she now ?
i don' t know .
trying to get a taxi , i suppose .
mariel .
you' re beautiful .
love me or leave me
make your choice , but believe me
i love you
i do , i do , i do , i do , i do
i can' t conceal it
don' t you see can' t you feel it
don' t you too
i do , i do , i do , i do , i do
oh , i' ve been dreaming
through my lonely past
now i just made it
i' ve found you at last
so come on now let' s try it
i love you , you can' t deny it
' cause it' s true oh , god .
don' t panic .
think of the games .
i do , i do , i do , i do , i do
she' s all yours , mate .
father , when you created mankind , you willed that man and wife should be one .
join david and muriel  mariel .
mariel in the loving union of marriage ... so that they may be living witness to your divine love in the world .
david , do you take mariel to be your wife ?
do you promise to be true to her in good times and in bad ... in sickness and in health to love and honour her all the days of your life ?
uh , yeah .
okay .
all right .
why not ?
i do .
mariel , do you take david to be your husband ?
do you promise to be true to him in good times and in bad ... in sickness and in health to love and honour him all the days of your life ?
i do .
you have declared your consent before the church .
may the lord strengthen that consent and fill you with his blessings .
what god has joined , men must not divide .
mariel , take this ring as a sign of my , uh
love and fidelity .
love and fidelity .
in the name of the father  in the name of the father , son and the holy spirit .
david , i take this ring as a sign of your love and fidelity ... in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit .
i now pronounce you man and wife .

we went to hibiscus island together .
we' re like sisters .
she' s my best friend .
i i tell her everything .
mariel !
oh , you look beautiful !
oh , isn' t she beautiful ?
she is wearing the make up , isn' t she ?
smile .
i was tryin ' to hide from you .
i saw your wheels .
i didn' t think you' d come .
i had to see it for myself .
just the bridesmaids were worth it .
i didn' t call them .
they came crawling back to me .
the way they picked on me in porpoise spit ... saying i wouldn' t amount to anything
and here i am , famous , and they' re at my wedding .
i showed them .
showed them what ?
i' m as good as they are .
i have to go .
good luck with what' s his name .
where are you going ?
where do you think ?

we' re catching the bus out tonight .
i don' t want you to .
well , you should have thought of that before you gave up on me .
i couldn' t pay all the rent without you .
i couldn' t even do the shopping .
i needed help .
i needed a friend .
i mean , i don' t want you to go back by bus .
i bought you two plane tickets .

to bill heslop and family ...
hazel and i were sorry to hear of the passing of betty .
we are thinking of you in your time of sorrow .

what are they doin ' ?
they' re , they' re writin ' it down .
i' il bet they are .
put that in your papers , you mongrel bastards .
i' ve still got friends .
how many families get telegrams from former prime ministers ... when somebody dies ?
i' m not forgotten .
betty heslop lived for her family .
she was very happy about her daughter mariel' s marriage ... and attending the wedding in sydney ... was one of the highlights of her life .
her life , during her last days on earth ... made me think of
mariel .
i' m sorry .
i thought i was so different a new person .
but i' m not .
i' m just the same as him .
heslop .
on the beach motel .
one .
i can' t stay married to you , david .
i' ve got to stop lying now .
i tell so many lies .
one day i won' t know i' m doing it .
i don' t love you .
i i don' t love you either , but , uh
i don' t know .
i i think i could like having you around .
i' il give you the money back .
it' s yours .
good luck in the games .
you too .
i don' t understand it .
why' d she burn the back yard ?
we' ve got to stick together .
you' ve got to help me with the kids .
what about deidre ?
she' il lend a hand .
i don' t think she' s keen to marry me ... now that livin ' with the kids has come into it .
someone' s got to look after them .
and it has to be you , dad .
you owe me , muriel .
now , this isn' t all of it ... but i' il pay the rest off when i get back to sydney and get a job .
so you' re not gonna help me out .
is that it ?
you owe us , dad .
we' re not useless .
we never were .
now you' re looking after the kids ... and you' re gonna tell them they' re not useless .
how about that telegram from bob hawke ?
how' d you get that ?
i phoned his office .
i was nearly in the state government .
fourteen votes i needed .
nobody knew who' d won for three days till the postal vote came in .
for three days , i was almost there .
couldn' t win a chook raffle now .
resigned from the council .
i' m unemployed .
got to go on the dole .
imagine the faces when i walk into that dole office .
you reap what you sow .
you' d think i' d have learned that growin ' up on a farm .
you reap what you sow .

bye , dad .
do you want me to open you a can of beer ?
that would be lovely , joanie .
with you in a sec .
i' m giving it another chance with chook as soon as he gets out of the correction centre .
they' ve accused him of raping a japanese tourist , which is ridiculous !
chook hates the japanese .
we better fly .
we' re meeting rose biggs for lunch .
rose biggs ?

we broke up .
i knew it wouldn' t last .
what makes you think i' d go anywhere with you ?
because i' m your friend .
muriel , you can' t come bargin ' in here without warning ... trying to turn rhonda against the people who love her against the people who were there for her when she needed them .

can you hear the drums , fernando
i remember long ago another starry night like this
in the firelight , fernando
you were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
i could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls
were coming from afar
they were closer now , fernando
every hour , every minute seemed to last eternally
i was so afraid , fernando
we were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
and i' m not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons
almost made me cry
there was something in the air that night
the stars were bright , fernando
they were shining there for you and me
for liberty , fernando
though we never thought that we could lose
there' s no regret
if i had to do the same again
i would , my friend , fernando
if i had to do the same again
i would , my friend , fernando
