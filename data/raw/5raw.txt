you have a new job now .
and what is that ?
sitting on a wire , stakeouts , log tapes .
a little public relations .
fourteen years on the job , and that' s all it means ?
i' ve gotta sit on a wire with some rookie listening to a housewife order groceries ?
all you had to do was keep your mouth shut .
all i did was tell the truth .
act like you belong on the same team as the rest of us .
what team ?
that bunch of suits sitting behind a desk trying to justify their existence ?
like me .
is that what you' re saying ?
i don' t know , joe .
why didn' t you say one thing to back me up ?
because you were wrong !
i wasn' t wrong !
you were dead wrong .
two teenage kids in cold blood , and you know it .
they were goddamn bank robbers , for christ' s sake !
they were kids .
will you forget about south dakota ?
forget who' s right and who' s wrong .
this is one of the best undercover guys .
how could i forget that ?
sit down , art .
sometimes ... you got somethin ' .
it' s ... magic .
then it goes away .
you had it .
but the magic' s gone .
they told you to break my balls , and see if you could get me to quit .
i' m not gonna make it easy for you .
you want me to sit on a wire , i' il do it .
you want me to chase file applicants , i' il do that .

are you scrambled ?
give me a break , leo .
i' m busy .
it' s mercury , dean .
somebody just walked on water .
you have to get up here now .
what did you just say ?
you are a stranger .
who is this ?
simon , put down the phone .
simon , simon , wait a second .
please don' t hang
who is that ?
listen to the timbre of his voice .
it' s a child .
that had to be his mother .
right .
it' s just some rug rat ... drooling over the phone , punching numbers , like a random thing .
huh ?
we' re not that lucky .
we have to call kudrow .
what ?
dean , what ?
no , no , no .
we don' t have to call anybody .
all we gotta do is an analysis , and give him a report when he gets back .
that' s it !
do you understand what just happened ?
we have to call him now or he' s gonna say we tried to hide it .
morning , sir .
good morning , marine .
i' ve got an urgent message for lieutenant colonel kudrow .
mercury is already operational in most of our com centers .
and i' m here to confirm everything you' ve already heard .
mercury is a quantum leap in our communications security .
and once we complete its installation in all of our com centers ,
it' s going to be very hard for our adversaries  and our allies .
and our allies to compromise our communications .
an urgent message for you , sir .
if you' il excuse me .
mr. johnson will continue the briefing .
all right , gentlemen .
lmpossible .
you' re late .
i wasn' t when i started .
traffic was like mud .
i oozed home .
i told simon he could wait up for you .
simon , my man .
i wonder where simon is .
time for bed , simon .
send in pedranski and crandell , please .
yes , sir .
who needs a fix ?
double tall , double dark , double sweet .
double everything .
i' m so glad i missed the whole drug thing ... so my body was virgin territory for caffeine .
it makes me feel so ricki lake , like i can talk to anybody .
what can i say ?
i' m the java queen .
what' s wrong ?
kudrow wants to see me .
cool !
maybe you' il get your own section .
no .
i , uh , i screwed up .
well , just go in there and throw him a bart simpson .
kudrow , dude , chill out .
it was that way when i got there .
doh !
puzzle line ?
puzzle line ?
now , i' ve traveled 10, 000 miles in the past 24 hours .
so i' ve had a lot of time to reflect on this .
correct me if i' m wrong .
but i believe neither one of you has ever said the words " puzzle line " to me .
before mercury went operational , we ran a standard validation protocol .
the works .
double sets of paired cray supercomputers , fricking velociraptor machines chewing at mercury 24 hours a day .
mercury came out unbent .
awesome , sir .
it was finally a code that couldn' t be broken .
but there was one last thing to check out .
the , um ... geek factor .
human beings will fool you sometimes .
we thought it important
we slipped a message in one of those egghead word games .
we dared amateurs to crack it .
we were sure nobody would ever call .
but somebody did .
his name is simon lynch .
he lives in chicago .
he is nine years old .
and he has deciphered a message written in the most sophisticated code ... the world has ever known ... in a geek' s puzzle magazine .
i don' t recall ever authorizing ... [ shouting ]
anyone to put any message ... into any magazine !
that couldn' t just happen .
a kid couldn' t just pop it open .
not only is he nine years old , he is handicapped .
he is autistic .
y es , that explains it .
so our $2 billion code is an open book ...
to people of diminished capacity ?
no , sir .
autism isn' t synonymous with diminished capacity .
autistic people are they' re shut off .
but it' s not unusual for an autistic person to be a savant .
oh , a savant !
he may not be able to actually decipher the code .
it might just appear to him .
right .
he didn' t calculate anything .
he just saw it .
like those stupid pictures at the mall .
you stare at them .
all of a sudden you' re looking at the statue of liberty .
exactly .
this is not a stupid picture at the mall .
this is national security .
looking at the best case scenario , let' s suppose the boy is unique ... and he doesn' t understand what he' s just done .
does that solve my problem ?
answer :: no !
all we need now is for someone else ... who understands his capability to come along , and my problems are increased exponentially .
then maybe we should talk to the kid .
and , uh  no .
no : no .
there must be nothing that connects the boy to this office .
nothing .
am i clear ?
y es , sir .
i want you to erase the tape .
am i clear ?
y es , sir .
honey , will you get that ?
y eah , i got it .
martin lynch ?
y eah .
detective burrell , chicago police .
sorry to bother you .
can i ask you a few questions ?
it' s very important .
i got your address from simon' s school .
something wrong ?
if i drag this out , it' s only gonna make things worse .
one of the other parents has made accusations ... against simon' s driver of a sexual nature .
oh , my god .
well , they' re only allegations at this point .
if i could step inside and speak with you .
uh , sure .
it won' t take more than a moment .
i don' t want to upset you .
well , you' ve already upset us .
i' m sorry about that .
would you like a cup of coffee ?
or something ?
yeah .
yeah , that' d be real nice .

what are you reporting ?
i have your location on my screen .
can you tell me what you' re reporting ?

the attorney general herself just called in 25 dimes on the cubs .
what do you think ?
uh  [ phone rings ]
y eah ?
this is 13 .
cubs ten times .
got it .
dumb bet , 13 .
cubs are in a slump .
would you mind if i told you something personal ?
y eah , i would , roger .
i really would .
excuse me .
y eah ?
art , for you .
yeah ?
we' re sending someone to spell you .
we' ve got another assignment for you .
lomax has another matter of national security for me ?
check into a possible missing child , 2 1 precinct .
chicago p. d. retains jurisdiction .
y eah .
lacerations .
nichols .
you still alive ?
still here , art .
how are ya ?
all right .
what is this ?
it' s supposed to be a missing kid .
it is .
these are the parents .
looks like a murder suicide .
so where' s the kid ?
missing , remember ?
what are you doin ' here ?
somebody called the f. b. l . and they sent me .
go figure .
no , i meant , what are you doin ' here ?
workin ' my way to the bottom , jack , just like you .
the kid' s name is simon .
neighbors say he' s retarded .
guys who kill their families kill all of ' em .
maybe he did the kid somewhere else .
didn' t want mom to see .
kid like that costs a bundle .
maybe dad got tired of knocking himself out for a kid who didn' t know better .
put ' em all out of their misery .
how' s a guy that' s so broke afford a $1500 handgun ?
mind if i take a look around , jack ?
we already did .
the kid' s not here .
does that mean you mind ?
hey , be my guest .
thanks .
by the way , lomax called .
he said it' s important .
y eah , i bet .
got a phone on you ?
what do you know ?
thanks .
be sure i get it back .
how are ya ?
good .
how ya doin ' , champ ?
you okay in there ?
come on .
you can come on out now .
nobody' s gonna hurt you .
i' m not gonna hurt ya .
okay ?
come on .
come on .
no , no , no , no !
simon !
all right .
quiet !
quiet !
call concordia .
get an ambulance over here .
have some badges waiting for us when we get there .
for what ?
i want this kid protected .
how am i gonna justify the overtime ?
since when you worry about overtime , jack ?
the coroner says murder suicide , they can go .
anybody asks about the overtime , put it on lomax' s gold card .
straps are just makin ' him worse .
they' re for his own safety .
unstrap him .
they' re for his own safety .
all right .
simon , we' re gonna unstrap you .
take it easy .
simon , just calm down .
all right ?
mommy !
daddy !
mommy !
daddy !
tell him to turn that off !
turn the siren off !
simon , ho .
hey !
now look .
who' s this ?
is that your mommy right there ?
is that your mommy ?
mommy !
mommy !
right there ?
yes , that' s right .
your mommy .
that' s her .
is that your daddy ?
daddy .
right .
do not touch .
it may be hot .
that' s very good advice .
is that your teacher ?
dr. london ?
she' s your friend , right ?
my name is art .
i' m your friend too .
art is a stranger !
art is a stranger !
art is a stranger !
okay , strap him in .
i won' t hurt you .
hi .
are you the doctor ?
um , no , i' m the nurse .
is a doctor gonna see this boy ?
uh , i took care of him .
is that the best you could do for him , just give him a shot ?
he' s autistic .
autistic ?
uh huh .
what does that mean ?
nothing gets through ?
no , it' s just the opposite .
everything gets through .
he has trouble with feelings and emotions .
so he gets very frightened and confused .
wait .
i' m not gonna be able to question this boy ?
probably not .
sorry .
take care of him .
why are we doing this , dean ?
why does he want to see us ?
we didn' t do anything wrong , right ?
should i turn around ?
no , he' d kill us .
he might kill us anyway .
are you being serious ?
relax , leo , please .
okay , i' m scared .
i' m gettin ' really , really scared .
leo , stop it .
we' re doing this together .
we didn' t break any laws .
no matter what he says or does , we' re gonna do the right thing .
so just relax .
jesus !
okay .
can we go home now , please ?
yeah , all right .
it' s him .
let' s just get this over with .
okay .
this changes everything .
now somebody else knows .
oh , god .
what happened to the boy ?
he' s alive .
he' s being held in a lockdown unit in a chicago hospital .
why don' t we tell somebody ?
because we are somebody , leo .
we' re the ones that are ultimately responsible for this .
there isn' t anybody to tell .
so i want you to keep the puzzle line open 24 hours a day .
and i want you two to do your goddamn fuckin ' jobs !
quiet !
maybe i' m goin ' about this the wrong way .
my wife says my people skills are like my cooking skills .
quick and tasteless .
but in the end , it' s about saving lives .
lsn' t that the point ?
y es ?
y es .
i know a man named rasheed halabi , born in paramus , new jersey .
valedictorian of his high school class , worked his way through m. l . t.
right now he' s a colonel in saddam' s republican guard .
we put him there .
it' s him this code is protecting .
there are thousands of other men and women just like him ... whose identities are protected by this code .
we can save their lives .
i give you my pledge .
i want you to give me yours .
diligence , loyalty and above all ... absolute silence .
this is kind of an interesting story .

there' s a warrant out for your arrest .
i killed a guy on the c. t. a.
oh , christ !
i had to .
he was trying to kill us .
how did this happen ?
somebody pulled the cops off the kid at the hospital .
it' s not a murder suicide .
the mom and dad got in the way .
they' re trying to get the kid .
if he hadn' t hidden , they' d have got him too .
i cannot handle this paranoid conspiracy crap .
it is a conspiracy .
who pulled the cops off the kid ?
did dead martin and jenny say " take my kid out of protective custody " ?
this is real !
i don' t give a fuck if it' s real .
if i don' t call lomax right now , i' m an accessory to this .
if you don' t get on the phone now , call concordia or c. t. a. , you' re a dumb cop .

today .
12 : 00 .
the wrigley building .
good boy .
i' m gonna start to take this personally if you don' t
hello ?
hello ?
oh !
oh , i' m sorry , sorry .
are you okay ?
i' m fine , really .
i' m sorry .
it was my fault .
i should' ve watched where i was going .
no , i shouldn' t have had it there .
the way my day' s going , i' m lucky you didn' t trip and sue me .
what do you got in there ?
plumbing supplies ?
look , this is gonna sound crazy , but i have a little problem ... and i was wondering if you could help me out .
you see that little boy sitting over there ?
do you think you could watch him for a couple of minutes ?
you didn' t just accidentally trip over the case , did you ?
he' s autistic .
and i' m his big brother .
not his real big brother , you know ?
big brothers of america .
it' s going really well , but i need to get a prescription filled for him .
normally i' d take him with me , but i don' t like to disturb him when he' s sitting so calmly .
you don' t have to do anything .
just sit here and be your lovely self .
please .
okay , yeah .
what' s his name ?
simon .
you sure this is okay ?
y eah .
if i can handle a district manager , i can handle anyone .
thank you .
i will be right back .
oh !
what' s your name ?
stacey .
stacey  sebring .
stacey , thank you so much .
i' il be right back .
i promise .
would have done it without the flattery ?
hey , simon . # # [ reggae ]
just keep walking .
keep walking .
jeffries ?
just keep walking .
i wasn' t sure you' d be here .
simon' s read the code twice .
that' s really incredible .
also very dangerous .
who do you work for ?
the c. l . a. ?
no .
the defense department ?
i' m afraid you' re not that lucky .
i think the f. b. l . likes to call us " no such agency .
why does the n. s. a. want a 9 year old autistic boy ?
the brain is still a mystery .
what ?
the reagan administration mandated the national security agency ... to generate a new code to protect american informants working for foreign governments .
we developed a super code at huge expense .
named it mercury .
we thought it was impenetrable .
you' re telling me a kid cracked a government super code ?
it doesn' t matter .
he can read it .
he might even be able to recreate it .
that' s why his life is in danger .
n. s. a. is willing to have this boy killed to protect a code ?
we may have already tried .
i think my division chief may have given orders
i' m a cryptographer , a nerd .
i don' t know what these people do .
maybe it' s routine killing kids , or maybe my boss is an aberration .
call an ambulance !
get an ambulance !
move it !
move it !
get out of the way !

there is nothing i can do .
low tech rules .
congratulations .
as of this morning , you made it to the very top of our own perp board .
i don' t have to tell you how profoundly pissed lomax is .
he' s keeping a lid on it to cover his ass , but you don' t have much time .
yeah .
did you find out who the shooter is ?
whatever happened to , " good morning .
how are you ?
sorry about your car .
it got impounded .
you won' t be able to get it for two weeks .
did you get in trouble ?
no .
i told them you stole it .
found him in the defense department data banks .
his name is peter burrell , special forces .
so , let' s bring him in .
can' t .
unless you want to dig him up .
he' s dead .
he' s listed as killed in beirut in 1982 .
you still think i' m paranoid ?
i don' t know , man .
who knows ?
but if you are , then i guess i' m paranoid too .
we' re in over our heads .
we can' t fuck with the n. s. a. so ?
we find somebody to talk to about this .
lomax ?
he' s a company man .
the n. s. a. could' ve gotten to him too .

i' il go above lomax .
i don' t want you to do anything else .
you got a wife and kid to take care of .

all right then .
what are you gonna do ?
i don' t know .
why are you doing this , art ?
that kid isn' t your responsibility .
whose responsibility is he ?
look at him .
he looks like a regular kid , right ?
one little circuit gets crossed .
zap !
he should' ve been smart , go to college , meet a girl , get married , have some kids , be cool .
are we talking about him , art , or are we talking about you ?
thanks for getting this together for me .
be careful .
yeah .
jesus !

hello , simon .

the f. b. l . ' s looking for me too .
oh , great .
so , how does this work ?
you murder me now or you wait till i' m asleep ?
simon needs to get a little sleep .

so , unless there' s anything else you need , i' d like to get some sleep now .
no , there' s nothing else .
thank you .
i promise you we' il be out of here first thing in the morning .
leo , you won' t believe the morning .
did i leave my
leo ?
oh , my god !
tom , there' s a woman downstairs asking to see art jeffries .
bring her up .
she won' t talk to anyone except art .
do me a favor .
i haven' t logged it in ... yet .
good .
how ya doin ' , man ?
anybody else with you ?
no .
this is emily lang .
emily , why don' t you have a seat ?
go ahead .
are you art jeffries ?
yeah , i' m art jeffries .
my boyfriend' s last will and testament .
i worked with him at n. s. a.
the other voice on the line .
his name was leo .
he was gonna mail one letter to you .
the other was addressed to the senate oversight committee .
the letters are gone .
this is all that' s left .
it has come to my attention ...
that my section director and immediate superior , nicholas kudrow ,
was directly involved in the deaths of martin and jenny lynch , " the parents of simon lynch , and the death of dean crandell , my colleague and friend .
they killed leo too right after he wrote that letter .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
thank you for coming down , emily .
i' m sorry about leo .
you said you were gonna be out before i went to des moines ... where hopefully i was gonna sell enough shoes to make the rent .
only i didn' t go to des moines and i didn' t make the rent because you had an emergency .
it was an emergency .
maybe you' re one of those guys that has constant emergencies .
everything has to be about excitement .
there are guys like that .
y es , i know , but i don' t happen to be one of them .
listen to me .
look at me !
this is not about me .
it' s about that little boy .
and he needs some help .
as far as i can tell , you are a decent , caring person .
i promise you we will be out of your life as soon as possible .
okay ?
look , if for some reason there is an emergency
oh !
you mean a different emergency !
yes , a different emergency .
do not call the police , okay ?
you call this guy .
he' s with the f. b. l .
i call the f. b. l . , not the police ?
right .
the police can' t protect simon .
right .
look .
simon is only in danger if they know where he is .
they don' t know where he is , so he' s not in danger , so you' re not in danger .
all right ?
right .
unless there' s an emergency .
it' s good to see you' re keeping your sense of humor about this .
yeah .
i promise you i will be back in this apartment at 2 : 00 tomorrow afternoon .
and i don' t know how yet , but i will make this up to you .
okay ?
thank you .
take care .
i don' t know if it qualifies as a plan .
i' m gonna fly there and show them leo' s letter .
here' s the bad news .
you gotta get simon into the witness protection program right away .
art , i' m not even supposed to be talking to you .
how do you expect me to authorize a move like that ?
lie , cheat .
i don' t give a shit .
you don' t do it , that kid' s as good as dead .
has it occurred to you that maybe kudrow would shoot you on sight ?
y eah , that has occurred to me .
if that happens , you know what to do with these .
hope i see you later .
sandy !
so glad you could make it .
heard ted had back surgery .
did you have anything to do with that ?
excuse me .
can i help you ?
excuse me .
nick , my good friend !
i want you to know that your mercury thing is a goddamn triumph .
i mean that .
i appreciate that , senator .
a feather in your cap .
the oversight committee is singing your praises .
you' re getting a reputation as the " can do " guy .
thank you .
i do appreciate that .
there' s a guy outside .
who ?
says he' s with the bureau .
would you excuse me one moment , please ?
if he wasn' t bureau , i wouldn' t have bothered you .
i would' ve lost him , but i didn' t know , sir .
no , ted , you used good judgment .
i' d like to see him .
he' s not very presentable .
bring him in the back way .
take him to the wine cellar .
i' il be down .
nick , i can' t believe you look so good for someone so old !
how do you do that ?
drugs , my dear .
massive doses of drugs .
please don' t handle the wine , mr. jeffries .
yes , i' ve read your file .
a deeply troubled f. b. l . agent with a lousy record ... kidnaps a nine year old boy .
nice goin ' .
you come to my home in the middle of a social function carrying a gun ... to confront me with this fabricated unsigned accusation , allegedly written by leo pedranski ... who was killed the day before yesterday by you , for all i know .
what do you want from me ?
i' d like to get back to my guests .
unsigned accusation was typed on carbon paper .
who uses that anymore ?
the late leo pedranski' s fingerprints were all over it .
the pomerello' s a little corky .
i' m sure the senate oversight committee won' t have any problem connecting you to the murder .
but you haven' t given the carbon to the senate oversight committee .
if you had , you wouldn' t be here right now .
you' ve got your precious carbon tucked away ... guaranteeing your safety , etcetera , etcetera ... so you can come here and demand what ?
untold millions in unmarked bills ?
i asked you not to handle the wine , please .
you know , it' s good to see you got your priorities in order .
that' s better .
you' re not worried about murdering a nine year old boy , but you' re worried about this fucking wine ?
here' s the deal .
i don' t give the senate oversight committee the carbon .
they don' t waste three years with their investigation , wailing and moaning ,
how could this happen in america ? " ... while you have one of your spooks whack simon lynch .
or ?
or you do the only thing that' il guarantee simon lynch his safety .
you or one of your superiors or the president of the united states ,
i don' t give a fuck who , but someone is gonna go on national television and tell america ... that your billion dollar , uncrackable code ... has been cracked by a nine year old autistic boy .
then you get your carbon back .
you know what i think , mr. jeffries ?
i think you' ve seen too many of those four wheel drive commercials on tv .
the ones where you get to drive fast and be a renegade .
let' s talk about the real world ... where you' re not some wonderful lone wolf hero , but you' re part of a team .
and you play your position because that' s what america is .
it' s one big team .
this might be difficult for you to grasp , but i am a patriot .
and a patriot is one who makes the right moral choice .
sometimes it takes a strong man to make that choice .
one boy who cannot survive on his own , one of nature' s mistakes , weighed against the lives of thousands of our people .
think about it .
you worked undercover .
how many of our agents will be put in harm' s way if this code is compromised ?
members of your team .
men like rasheed halabi , an lraqi american and a great patriot .
a man , who as we speak , is undercover in saddam' s republican guard .
a man who has not seen his family
that' s for simon' s parents , you piece of shit .
you got 36 hours .
should be enough time to get your undercover people out of harm' s way .
oh , by the way .
happy birthday , nick .
hello ?
hey , it' s me .
y eah .
you all right ?
y eah , i' m all right .
how' d it go with the witness protection thing ?
everything' s set .
tomorrow night , 8 :: 15 ,
u. s. marshalls are gonna meet us with a chopper ... at the heliport on top of the g. e. x. building .
i took your advice .
i lied .
all right .
good .
see you then .
bye .
that was recorded on passive v. o. x ... at agent jordan' s residence at 11 : 58 p . m .
as to the pickup , since we can assume the boy will not be alone ,
i suggest we wait until we get him on the chopper .
saw them do this in the movies .
how are you , laddie boy ?
oh , damn !
simon , turn it down , please !
hello ?
hello ?
hello ?
how much i owe you ?
twenty dollars , sir .
here .
thanks a lot .
stacey ?
stacey ?
shit !
hello ?
tommy , where are they now ?
hello ?
tommy , where are they now ?
relax .
simon and the girl are fine .
i talked to ' em .
she said she got spooked .
someone called .
when she picked up the phone the line was dead .
it was me from the airplane .
told ' em when witness protection is gonna pick ' em up ?
absolutely .
she' s gonna meet us there .
everything' s set .
listen , i gotta go .
agent jordan .
lieutenant colonel kudrow of the n. s. a.
what am i looking at here , tommy ?
you forged documents to obtain witness protection under false pretenses .
don' t listen to anything this guy tells you .
this guy is dangerous .
tommy , sit down , and don' t speak .
agent jordan , regardless of what you think of me ,
i only want to resolve this situation to rescue a young boy ... from a delusional kidnapper .
we will proceed with the pickup as planned .
as of this moment , the f. b. l . will stand down ... and the n. s. a. will take over from here .
gentlemen .
chief , take a look at this .
i' m not taking a look .
you have to look at this !
leo pedranski worked for kudrow .
he wrote that letter .
he was also killed after he wrote it .
i ran it through the lab .
and the fingerprints on it are an exact match for his .
up .
that' s where we' re goin ' , simon .
come on .
is that you , art ?
i' m a united states marshall with the witness protection program .
how do you do ?
good .
you must be simon .
chopper on approach , sir .
why don' t you come with me , son ?
no !
he doesn' t like to be touched by strangers .
i' il take him .
come on , simon .
let' s go see the helicopter .
i thought art was supposed to meet us here .
there' s been a change in plans .
but i want to assure you that your country owes you the greatest debt of gratitude .
chopper coming in !
don' t have much time !
for the safety of the boy , you should go home now and forget you were here .
okay , simon , you' re gonna go for a ride in the helicopter .
good bye , simon .
you can go with him .
tommy .
they' re on the helipad , and the chopper' s coming in .
you have a green light .
go , go , go , go !
it' s a go .
let' s move .
go , go !
hold them back !
stay down !
stay down !
no !
no !
no !
no !
no !
simon !
let me go .
come on !
no !
no !
no , simon , no !
get up .
get up , get up .
that' s right .
tommy , no !
hold ' em back !
hold your fire !
keep ' em back now !
no !
where' s the team leader ?
right here , agent jeffries .
it' s kudrow' s piece .
i got a nine millimeter on the sidewalk .
i' il take care of it .
let' s see what you got .
i want you to say " bug .
bug .
can you look at me ?
bug .
bug .
that' s very good .
i like that very much .
can i help you ?
i' m art jeffries , a friend of simon lynch .
yes , i know .
his foster parents told me all about you .
how' s he doing ?
he' s fine .
he' s adjusted very well .
do you want to say hello ?
he probably wouldn' t remember me .
i was told ... not to expect too much .
i brought him some puzzles .
he likes puzzles .
do you think you could give these to him , please ?
sure , but i think it would be better for simon if you did .
it' s okay .
come on .
thank you .
hey , simon .
how you doin ' , partner ?
i brought you some new puzzles .
you might like those .
hey , simon , look at me .
look at me , simon .
look in my eyes .
look in my eyes .
it' s me , art .
