hey , yeah .
the 1960' s ?
happy times , heavy times .
all right , so you get your daughter , right ?
she might be catholic , jewish , anything .
so you bring her up in what they call ... the bourgeois , american type society family .
bring them up so they don' t screw until they get married .
you take them to church on sunday .
teach them all you can about bringing up a family ... how you should look and act ... then you send them to college .
you bust your hump .
no government subsidy .
nobody' s paying nothing .
you save your money , or you borrow the money ... you work overtime , you send her to college .
you want her to get an education .
the first easter she comes home on a vacation ... she says , " hey , dad , i' m living with some guy .
you' re living with some guy ?
what do you mean ?
this is the thing now .
free love .
we' re getting away from the original point .
what we' re trying to find is , why are these bastards rioting ?
because they did dope .
listen , you' re going in the wrong direction .
what of it ?
what happens is , look , i' m sending you to school ...
i' m breaking my ass to send you to college , right ?
i expect you' re going to learn something .
why be a janitor ?
learn something .
to justify my investment in you .
but some of these people revel in the fact ... that their kids are leaders , are rabble rousers .
this son of a bitch just started a riot .
these kids think they' re the first generation ... that ever screwed before they got married .
we all did , but we always had one girl .
she screwed ... that girl you took out .
it' s better off these kids don' t get married ... because they haven' t got the guts to stick with it .
hey , you fucking intellectuals
you think you' re so where it' s at
before you fill your minds with any junk
better listen to fritz the cat
' cause writers and poets and artists
it' s your duty to live life to the most
so fly out , brothers , and check out the world
give me a ride to the coast
fritz the cat

laid many a good woman
live life to the fullest
cry out for more until it bleeds

i' ve read everything james baldwin' s written .
he has a true sense of the problems of black people .
i worked for head start for free last summer .
black kids are so much groovier .
i went to a couple of black panther meetings .
the time for non violent revolution is past .
more power to the people !
i' m taking a course in african studies at school .
i had no idea you people were so civilized .
do you know that property values ... actually go up when a black family moves in ?
freud didn' t write for the black man .
why does a great actor like james earl jones ... always have to play black men ?
don' t you hate it when people say " colored " or " negro " ... and not " black " ?
black is beautiful .
it' s so great that black people wear their hair natural ... not emulating the image of beauty ... white people inflict upon them .
i had a black girlfriend once who said that jewish people ... were the closest to black people .
i' m jewish , you know .
i ain' t no jive ass black nigger , honey .
who do you think i am ?
geraldine ?
oh , god !
oh , jesus !

my soul is tormented .

i' ve been up and down the four corners of this big old world .
i' ve seen it all !
i' ve done it all !
gee .
wow .
i' ve fought many a good man , laid many a good woman .
i' ve had riches and fame and adventure .
stood face to face with danger and death countless times .
are you somebody famous ?
i think i saw you in a movie once .
try not to interrupt , huh ?
i' ve tasted life to the fullest ... and still my soul cries out ... in this hungry , tortured , wrecked quest , " more !
look at the good side of life .
things aren' t all bad .
gee , he' s handsome .
you .
you can help me .
you must save me .
by so doing , you , too , will be saved .
i' d like to , but what can i do ?
lovely set of eyes there .
little sweet one with your heart of gold ...
i know of a place where we can be alone ... to join our souls in sacred truth .
i want to be in on this thing .
what about my soul , you fink ?
four in bed ... that' s a kick i haven' t tried yet .

i just want to feel those miles flying by .
i' m hungry !
let' s dig one of those little greasy truck stops .
i' d like to talk with those truck drivers , you know ?
hear what they got to say about life on the road .
i bet they got wild stories of the road .
drivers , trucks , hijackers !
fights !
let' s do it .
here' s a good place .
i' il have your deluxe steak with salad and coffee .
black .
all right .
what would you like , sir ?
that was really a fine steak .
you can always depend upon howard johnson' s .
let' s get back on the road .
goddamn .
fritz !
wake up !
huh ?
what ?
the car is broken down ... and i can' t get the damned thing ...
what ?
where are we ?
fuck a duck .
we' re out in the middle of the frigging desert .
jesus , it' s great !
exactly .
you' ve been sound asleep for two days .
what ?
two days .
you must' ve been dragged out after your big binge .
shit .
i guess i was .
all that drinking and blowing pot and screwing , man .
man , i get horny just thinking about it .
like , wow !
start thinking about fixing this car , fritz ... or we' il be sitting here forever .
look , is something bugging you , pal ?
the car won' t go !
well , let' s have a look .
i knew that all the time .
the engine' s not up here .
it' s in the back .
let' s just check it out .
what' s wrong ?
let me see , i' il just ...
if i move that ... no ...
what' s wrong , fritz ?
it' s all very complicated , winston .
i couldn' t begin to explain it .
i think the piston rod' s stuck in the drive shaft .
either that , or the carburetor is rusted out .
oh , good god .
here comes a pickup truck .
maybe he' il give us a push to the next gas station .
what' s the trouble , buddy ?
our car is busted down .
could you give us a push to the next gas station ?
let me look at it .
one thing i' m good at is fixing things .
shut up !
please shut up , chickens !
shut up !
please shut up !
i mean , shut up !
one thing i' m good at ... is fixing things .
dumb chickens .
let me see now .
ain' t nothing the matter with this car here .
buddy , ain' t you got any sense at all ?
you just let your car run out of gas .
i swear , these motherfucking hippies from new york .
there' s a gas station a couple of miles back .
i' m going this way .
you ought to stop for gas once in a while , you stupid ...
gotta keep your engine fed .
wise up , buddy .
well , how do you like that ?
new york hippies come down here ... and they think they can ...
i never , honest and true .
you think a thing like that happens ...
son of a bitch .
you' re so clever .
so clever .
big mechanical genius .
here' s a bucket , smart guy .
good luck .
hey , this is for shit !
you made a big bourgeois deal out of everything ... and ruined it completely .
i was gonna bug out and be free from all this bullshit ... and roam around and dig everything ... and really have a good time .
your naivete is astounding .
you' d be completely lost without me , fritz ... and you know it .
you' re a motherfucking bitch .
i see the hard facts of life .
i am realistic , something you' re incapable of .
you' d be better off with one of those stupid morons ...
like charlene , who you could sleep with and throw away .
you can' t cope with a mature woman .
you haven' t the faintest idea how lucky you are ... that an intelligent woman ...
loves you and wants to give you something of value ... something that will inflame your creative potential !
now , get going and hurry up !
we' il see who gets lost without whom .
fritz the cat
fritz the cat
fritz the cat
i' m the envy of each and every guy in town
she looks so sharp , and the girl does , too
and everybody knows what i' m gonna do
gonna take a ride on my bike
gonna take it and drive all night
tell my chevy to take a hike

blue , i' m crazy about you .
penniless .
a regular bum .
a hobo with no money and no place to go .
hey , you old scroungy old alley cat .
get out of them garbage cans .
you talking to me , jack ?
what the hell you doing there , anyway ?
man , here we are on the brink of the apocalypse ... the eve of destruction , so to speak ... and i can' t think of anything to do .
offhand , son , i' d say you have got a problem .
but at least you' re honest .
the revolution can use a man like you .
hop on .
hello there .
hi .
how are you ?
high .
i' il introduce you to the guys at the cell meeting .
blue !
glad you could make it , man .
howdy , john .
i brought along an old buddy of mine .
he' s a bright lad but bored with life .
fritz ... this here is john ... former biker and small time hood ... turned fighter for the cause .
that cat was a beautiful head .
glad to meet you , man .
another castout for the bourgeois view .
from the mold of bankrupt sedentary .
what' s the state of his political consciousness ?
practically nil , i' m afraid .
our shipment came in today .
thirty two survivors .
go around .
hey , chief .
getting ready for a little action planned for tonight .
we' re gonna paralyze the whole fucking city .
it' s going to be great , man .
the shit is really gonna come down tonight .
we' ve got everything we need ... for three synchronized sabotage actions .
the city will be ours .
the machinery of the establishment ... will be in ruins by morning .
the government will fall without firing one goddamn shot .
the new mayor will resign ... and we' il move in and set up a tribunal .
it' s curtains .
blue , honey , talk to me a minute .
don' t bother me .
i want to talk to you , honey .
let' s go .
leave me the hell alone .
we' il go and get some chinks .
i' m so hungry .
i ain' t hungry .
don' t turn off on me .
besides ...
i don' t need that garbage .
every time you' re with your friends you don' t pay ...
you son of a bitch !
that hurt me , god damn it !
what do you think i am , a boxing ball ?
a punching bag !
hit her !
hit her !
you know what you guys are ?
you' re a bunch of closet fags .
shut up !
and when i leave this place ... you' il get together and screw one another .
that' s nice .
that is nice .
see , she loves it .
i love it , too .
we' ve got a lot of lousy time to kill .
i think i' m gonna ride that goddamn horse .
then go on , have a go .
you' il love it .
let me ride that goddamn horse .
get on with it .
you know what you are ?
you' re a bunch of fucking nazi fags !
guys , that' s uncool .
don' t do that .
listen , you son of a bitch .
you lousy ...
cut it out .
you' re hurting her !
you maniacs !
what are you doing to her ?
go ahead and hit me !
my god , my god !
i can' t take it anymore !
this isn' t working out , blue .
our relationship stinks .
come on , harriet .
let' s go inside .
it' s cold .
i have to go to bed by day .
come on inside , baby .
you' il get hurt out here .
listen , i tried to stop them , but i ...
come on , fritz !
wait a minute , huh ?
john says this night will mean ... a great leap forward for america' s social evolution .
i dig it .
we' re gonna blow up the power plant .
this will keep you warm .
i gotta go .
hey , baby .
we all had a good time and got our rocks off .
now we must devote ourselves to the great task before us .
what' d you have to hit her so hard for ?
she loved it .
me and you have been assigned to blow up the power plant .
that' s all i care about .
the revolution .
you' re full of shit !
all you care about ... is a reason to hurt , to destroy , to blow up .
you don' t know what a real revolution is .
none of you sons of bitches do .
harriet , well , she' s good .
she' s real .
she loves .
she loves .
and when you get right down to it ... that' s where it' s really at .
the love you give is equal to the love you get .
well , fuck it .
i ain' t doing it .
so long , fritz .
i ain' t planting this bomb for you schmucks .
far out .
and though after my skin worms destroy this body ... yet in my flesh shall i see god ... whom i shall see for myself .
you gotta let us see our fritz !
where is he ?
what have you done with him ?
you can' t go in there .
i' m sorry , girls .
he' s under house arrest .
let us see him !
please !
no one gets in .
he' s hurt .
lord jesus ... and shalt believe in thine heart ... that god hath raised him from the dead .
i reckon he needed her .
he must be through .
finished .
for with the heart ... man believeth unto righteousness ... and with the mouth ... confession is made unto salvation .
he that covereth his sins shall not prosper ... but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them ... shall have mercy .
fritz , we' re so sorry , baby .
he' s trying to say something .
i' ve been up and down ... the four corners ... of this big old world .
i' ve ... seen it all ... and i' ve done it all .
i' ve fought many a good man ... and i' ve laid many a good woman .
and ... if there' s one thing i' ve learned ... it' s ... it' s ... you get over here ... and you get down there like that ...
poor cat .
he was a ... he was a tough kid at that , wasn' t he ?
down the lane
they' re strolling
two by two
holding hands
they smile like we used to do
here with their one and only
i' d forgotten i was lonely
oh , how i wish
that here were there with you
all the days of sadness
they seem so needless now
yes , it' s taken me
this long , long time
to see
it' s clear
and my dreams
keep drifting back to me
and our strolls
beneath these same stars above
and when the leaves
are falling
my heart will be recalling
you' re the only girl
i ever really loved
