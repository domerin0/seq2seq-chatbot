he' s over there !
he' s this way !
this way !
this way !
hurry up !
hello ?
it' s clark stevens from farley university .
hello ?
i' m looking for dr. franks .
excuse me , do you know where i can find dr. franks ?
it doesn' t like it when you say that !
and it doesn' t like you !
leave him alone .
can' t you tell he doesn' t like you touching him like that ?
it doesn' t like it when you say that .
and it doesn' t like you either , puddles !
it' s too fucking bad !
that' s enough , puddles .
i' m dr. hendricks .
clark stevens .
welcome to cunningham hall .
thank you very much .
i hope you don' t mind i let myself in .
no , we' ve been expecting you .
well , my train ran a little late .
and it' s hard to find a cab to take you out here .
yet here you are .
yes , here i am .
we should probably begin with a series of psychiatric tests ... to make sure we start with a clean bill of mental health ...
followed by a thorough physical .
betty .
mr. franklin .
what did we talk about when we said no more pretending we' re a doctor ?
but , but i was ...
i know , mr. franklin .
why don' t you go back in the rec room and make yourself at home ?
nurse hendricks is going to serve pudding pops .
won' t that be nice ?
very nice .
good boy !
it was nice to meet you .
hi .
i' m betty donner .
clark stevens .
i' m the administration coordinator .
i' m sorry i missed you up front .
i just stepped away for a moment .
don' t worry about it .
i' m glad to finally meet you .
same here .
we are so excited about your coming in to lend us a hand .
i' m excited about getting to work .
wonderful .
wonderful .
perfect .
i' il have your badge ready for you in a few days .
i need you to fill out these forms ... so you get school credit .
blue card on the bottom' s for emergency information .
your keys to the kingdom .
thank you .
and your walkie talkie .
that' s how we communicate here .
you' il stay in a cottage on the south side of the building .
well , there' s only one thing left .
what' s that ?
to meet the big cheese .
dr. franks .
very good .
hello , betty .
i take it this place has been around for a while .
since 1918 .
you should have seen the shape it was before we spruced it all up .
it took our patient clean up committee ... a year and a half to get it to this point .
they' ve done such a marvelous job .
absolutely .
no , i' m sure .
it' s just ...
it seems a little rundown .
not particularly conducive to rehabilitation .
for some of the patients , that will never happen .
get me out of here .
carl !
i shouldn' t be here !
no one should .
carl ...
it' s okay .
they don' t let you go home even when they know you' re better .
why do you say that ?
because the people running this place ... are really the crazy ones .
guilty as charged .
now run along .
go on , scoot !
have a seat .
the doctor will be with you momentarily .
good luck .
thank you very much , betty .
' einstein also believed ... some chronic schizophrenics were ... misdiagnosed due to possible psychokinetic conditions ... such as their ability to see paranormal activities . '
not a pleasant way to receive mental health treatment .
i received your records from the university .
4 . 0 average .
my , my .
you have the potential to follow in your grandfather' s footsteps .
thank you .
i hope so .
my internship here is all i need to get my degree .
then what ?
well ... to take residence in a mental health facility as a counselor .
that goes without saying .
what' s going on with these ?
put them in a cup , polly .
sorry , dr. franks .
my minor , sir , is in administrations .
i' d love to work in a place like cunningham hall .
maybe design an updated curriculum .
i researched the building and its operating procedures .
i made notes .
little changes we might implement ... during my stay .
mr. stevens ...
i hope you understand what you' ve gotten yourself into here .
i' m sorry ?
this isn' t a summer camp .
we have neither funding nor time for anything but patient maintenance .
i absolutely understand that has to be the priority , but ...
you want to empty bedpans to make your grades better ... great .
but you' re not in class ... reading about life in a mental institute .
you' ve arrived .
i didn' t mean any disrespect .
i just thought ...
let me be blunt .
you' re not here to think .
if you want to be on my staff , i want you to focus on the objective .
that is ?
maintenance of the mentally ill .
make no mistake .
there are serious reasons why ... a person would be locked up in here .
where is this wonder boy i have heard so much about ?
dr. morton , dr. douglas .
clark stevens .
nice to meet you .
it is you .
i' d recognize you anywhere .
i met your grandfather ... at the chicago conference of mental health sciences in ' 75 .
he and i went on such a bender ...
i was discussing our operating procedures with mr. stevens .
we' ve come to an understanding .
introduce him to sara , then she can give him the grand tour .
i like to give my favorites a little extra .
you never know when you might need a little favor .
noted .
so you survived the franks interview .
yes .
just barely .
some say it' s the worst ... shock treatment the hospital offers .
i can' t argue with that .
he' s kind of a shark , the bottom line' s if you work hard ... he' il hire you full time .
that' s what he did with me .
i would just ideally love to help change this place .
improve it a bit .
that' s what we all say ... until the third time you' re stabbed with a pencil .
point taken .
when did you start working here ?
last year .
i served the same internship you did .
so you graduated last year ?
you' re a year older than me .
which means you have to do everything i say .
come on .
i' il be your tour guide today .
this is b ward .
group therapy' s in there .
showers , med station .
we keep it locked for obvious reasons .
also we keep some low security risk patients here .
ladies ' rooms .
your duties will range from monitoring patients ... sitting on group therapy sessions ... to assisting staff .
speaking of which , brace yourself .
nurse hendricks .
sara .
you must be clark .
yes , indeed .
nice to meet you .
he' s the new intern .
of course he is .
i' m anabelle hendricks , head nurse .
pleasure .
i wondered where you went to .
seems to be a regular occurrence lately .
i' m sorry , i haven' t been feeling well .
you' il assist nurse hendricks as well as other staff .
i look forward to it .
so do i.
it will be nice to have a little muscle here .
may i speak with you in the office , please ?
sure .
he' s been up there ... for months .
who has ?
we need to change the prescription .
i signed off on everything .
you need to be there at precisely ...
sara ?
do you understand ?
ready for more ?
sure .
enjoy your stay here , clark .
thank you very much .
what a bitch .
come on .
that' s crystal .
she' s our resident nymphomaniac .
come on .
where are we going ?
to the unpleasant part of this job .
where we keep high risk patients .
you won' t often be asked to come down here .
trust me , it' s a good thing .
what is it ?
housing for potential murderers , lunatics ...
your everyday garden variety maniacs .
that sounds interesting .
look ... this is where they tuck away people everyone wants to forget .
the ones you never hear about .
unless they have the chance to act on their natural instinct .
which is ?
to rip you limb from limb .
welcome to the madhouse .
after you .
wallace .
hey , sugar .
they been asking for you all day .
this is clark .
he' il be with us for a while .
my condolences .
here you go .
he' s going to need your belt .
here' s the drill .
stay behind the yellow line at all times .
if you need help ... push the alarm at the end of the hall .
i need your pen ... and any other sharp objects on you .
they can' t get out , can they ?
that' s what they keep telling me .
nice to meet you .
ready for this ?
sure .
i' ve volunteered in a couple of hospitals before .
i can' t believe they keep patients down here .
run into that on your volunteer work ?
let me out .
i have something for you .
where are you going ?
where are you going ?
you are not going to leave me down here !
get back here and hook a sister up !
severe obsessive compulsive disorder .
she has to do everything in sets of nine .
including the doses of strychnine ... she gave her preschool class .
paranoid ?
homicidal .
sara !
sara !
sara , help !
no , it' s okay .
it' s okay .
drake !
royce is at it again .
can you bring his meds down ?
royce , calm down !
it will be fine .
drake' s on his way with your meds .
god !
sara !
let go !
let go !
drake !
it' s all right .
he didn' t hurt me !
drake !
he didn' t hurt us .
let' s hope he gets it right next time .
here , big guy .
thanks , kid .
i owe you one .
let' s get out of here .
betty , this is wallace .
i' m heading home .
drake is here .
dottie' s got a roast waiting that has my name all over it .
that' s a big 10 4 , wallace .
you have a nice evening .
over .
10 4 , betty .
you , too .
over and out .
hello ?
hey , i saw you .
why don' t you come out and introduce yourself ?
drake , are you still here ?
i could use help .
i have a situation in the rec room .
once again , alice ... are you going to do what your caretaker is requesting of you ?
you' re hurting my arm !
i' m trying to make sure you don' t hurt yourself .
take your pills if you want to get better .
doesn' t that make sense , sweetheart ?
i' m going to ask that you take your medication ... or i' m afraid i' il have to resort to disciplinary measures .
he' il watch when you are sleeping .
do we have an understanding ?
do you think i enjoy hurting you like this ?
that medicine don' t work on me !
alice !
stop !
bite your tongue , carl !
you' re hurting her !
get away from me , you faggot !
it' s okay .
drake !
you get back !
it' s late for you , isn' t it ?
it wants me to go to sleep now .
let' s go .
kid !
unbelievable .
i saw you come down here .
why don' t you come out ?
hey , kid , come on .
this isn' t a good place to be .
you could get ... hurt .
safety alarm at the end of the hall .
jesus !
there' s no one in there .
dr. morton , how long have you worked here ?
i' ve worked here for 27 years .
that' s a long time .
you have no idea .
that were you doing down there after hours ?
i followed the little boy .
that kid running around .
he broke into my room .
i chased him to see who he was .
it' s strange that he runs around here at night .
i guess the whole place is a little strange
occupational hazard .
i guess so .
that noise i keep hearing , what is that ?
it sounds like it comes from the basement .
i figured it was the water pipes ?
maybe .
well , what is it ?
it' s an old building .
it can be a variety of things .
but ...
buildings are like people .
they remember everything that happened to them through time .
sometimes ... they don' t like what they remember .
what do you mean ?
a while back ... we had a patient down in cell 44 .
he was the saddest sickest subject i' ve ever come across .
one night he ... dug himself out ... but he got turned around and couldn' t find his way .
what happened ?
he jumped out a third story window .
did he die ?
some say he died when he hit the ground .
some say they caught him and locked him back up .
but i ...
i believe he' s still here ... trying to dig his way out and go home .
you believe that ?
either that or he came back to run this place .
mr. stevens ...
i have a wet cleanup in the tv room .
if you' re not too busy , perhaps you could mop it up ?
sure .
sneaking around ...
leaving maximum security open .
you' ve had quite a first night , mr. stevens .
i wasn' t sneaking around .
speak to me .
nurse hendricks called for help over the radio and i came .
and ?
and i got to the rec room and realized she didn' t need help ... being that she was using a taser on a patient .
some patients have to be constantly reminded ... who has the upper hand .
refusing to take medication doesn' t warrant an electrical burn .
stevens ...
this place is a mess .
it' s dirty , it' s unsafe , it' s understaffed .
are you aware there are children running around here at night ?
no one gets in or out without my authorization .
what about the patient that escaped from the basement ?
dr. morton told me about ... a patient who escaped .
dr. morton doesn' t know what he' s talking about .
look , let' s start over again , all right ?
while it' s no secret this place could use fixing up ... most of the patients housed here are content .
you know why ?
they have no place else to go .
i' il make you a deal .
stick to the rules , mind your own business .
i' il consider some of the suggestions you put together .
are we in agreement , mr. stevens ?
fine .
well , hello there , busy bee .
good morning .
what are you trying to pull here ?
i have no idea what you' re talking about .
albert , things will change here ... or i' m placing a call to the board .
i know what you are up to .
hey , new guy !
hey there .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
i' m on my way back to my room .
do you want to sit in on an obsessive compulsive group ... at 3 : 30 ?
it' s my own little session .
it sounds great , really ...
but , i don' t want to get into any more hot water .
why , what' s wrong ?
nothing .
i was in frank' s office and i saw something weird .
he has a lot of weird books .
one , in particular on his desk ... he put it away when he realized i saw it .
are you sure you' re not a private detective disguised as an intern ?
i' m a dork ?
you' re a dork .
the guy reads weird books .
maybe he' s learning about his bedside manner .
sara , to the nurses ' station , please .
copy .
got to go .
good luck .
good night , nurse hendricks .
everyone in bed ?
all tucked in .
i' m almost done .
if you don' t need anything i' il go lay down .
i' il check it out .
is there something we can help you with ?
it' s bedtime !
i don' t have time for foolishness !
come out and show yourself .
i don' t have time to waste and i don' t want to hurt you .
who are you ?
you are only hurting yourself .
well ...
i suppose if you aren' t going to come out ... you' il have to make yourself cozy until drake arrives .
he' il find a way to convince you to go back to your room .
stop !
why are you doing this ?
stop !
i know you' re all devastated by what happened .
i want to know which patient did this and i want to know by tonight .
betty will assign each of you a section .
i want you to interview the residents .
they trust you .
i want you to use that trust .
keep the authorities out , or the patients will give you nothing .
then we will thoroughly review the security and safety protocol .
let' s get going .
roger that .
i can' t believe this happened .
i worked with her for 25 years .
she was such a nice lady .
dr. morton ?
get dr. shores , take the west wing .
everything' s okay .
dr. douglas said she was with you before it happened .
did you see anyone ?
we heard someone in the hall ... and she went to check it out .
then i heard loud music and i ...
they think a patient did it ?
clark !
you and drake are in the basement .
don' t be afraid , clarkie .
i' il protect you .
all right .
i have to go .
yeah , sure .
we didn' t see ...
anything .
we were sleeping .
our door is locked .
tight as a drum .
are you dating sara ?
if you remember anything , let me know .
i' il kill you , you freak !
i' il make sure you rot there the rest of your life !
what' s wrong ?
i' il teach this freak to show respect .
take a break .
i' m almost done here .
i' il be out in a minute .
why don' t you come inside and i' il make us a remy martins ?
it' s the ones who protest too much ... that end up wearing their wives ' panties !
why won' t you talk to me ?
it might help you sort things out .
how does it feel to be convinced something is there ... when logic tells you it' s not ?
i thought i was hearing things .
now you know what madness feels like .
that' s a feeling you' il never forget .
why are you sitting in the dark ?
lilumination only reminds me of what i' ve become .
what' s your name ?
that' s a subjective question .
there was a problem here last night .
so we' re taking time with each resident ... asking them if they heard or saw anything unusual .
funny you' d ask a madman ... if he' s seen anything unusual .
all right , thank you .
pretty strange place , this cunningham hall .
how so ?
bad things going down here .
but you know that .
what kind of bad things ?
take that sick individual lurking around , for instance .
someone who' s comforted by the warmth of fresh blood .
who do you think it is ?
you' re a smart boy , you' il figure it out .
is it you ?
the top of the food chain would be a good place to start looking .
are you speaking of dr. franks ?
they' re cell numbers on a prescription to me .
go to betty or wallace to find out who the hell they are .
they wouldn' t know their own names if you asked them .
can you tell me what the patient in cell 44 was diagnosed with ?
i just keep them doped up .
do you know what medication he' s on ?
you sure have a lot of questions .
risperdex .
that' s what they' re all on down there .
an antidepressant .
have you seen the place ?
thank you , grace .
you' re breaking rule number one ... about working in a place like this .
what' s that ?
taking what the patients say seriously .
i' m not .
believe me , i' m not .
i did hear hendricks and franks arguing ... the night she got killed .
you have to understand these patients are totally delusional .
they' il tell you things they actually believe to be true .
but hardcore schizophrenics in particular can' t be trusted .
take what they say with a grain of salt .
i understand that .
it just seemed weird .
he was being cryptic .
they' re paranoid .
they have it out for franks because he' s keeping them locked in here .
you' re reading too much into this conversation .
you can never trust a schizo .
why are all the patients in the basement ... on the same medication ?
because i' m sure they' re keeping them seriously tranquilized .
i used to love to play outside this time of day .
me and my friends .
we played kick the can ... sometimes dodge ball .
i was good at that .
too afraid of getting hit by the ball , i guess .
then one day things started to go bad .
how so ?
i started seeing stuff .
stuff before it happened .
one day my parents dropped me off here to have some tests run .
and they never came back .
that' s a rough thing to carry with you .
you can try to steer your life in the direction you want , but ... everything happens as it' s meant to be .
maybe so .
i think you' re not meant to be here anymore .
you' re right .
but the day i leave here ... will be the day that i' m dead .
that' s one of the bad things about knowing stuff before it happens .
my little problem ... stems from the fact ...
i was never allowed to get in touch with my inner child .
i' m a vulnerable child ... trapped inside an adult' s body .
and wearing an adult diaper .
up yours , jimmy !
okay , calm down .
look , we' re all grieving right now .
some of us feel vulnerable ... or depressed .
or scared .
that' s right , alice .
what makes you feel scared ?
it won' t stop scaring me .
what won' t ?
i try to close my eyes , make it go away .
it' s always right there , watching me .
what is this ' it ' that you' re referring to ?
the ghost .
what ghost ?
the one that runs through the house at night .
it' s always watching me through the windows .
what does it want from you ?
to make sure that i never forget what madness feels like .
it' s betty .
did i awake you ?
not at all .
i was just getting up .
great .
i wanted you to know your badge is ready .
dr. franks wants to know if you had anything to report ... from yesterday' s interviews .
i' ve still got one more patient i' d love to talk to down there ... but it seems like they were all in their cells .
drake checked the locks and it didn' t appear they could get out .
just keep me posted .
i' ve got to type up ... the findings and give them to the investigator .
okay .
fantastic .
so nice of you to come down .
we seldom get visitors down here in our little pit of despair .
why did you stop talking to me last time i was down here ?
i' d run out of things to say .
why don' t you come into the light where i can see you ?
come on , we' re friends by now .
let' s just say i suffered a slight disfigurement as a child .
since then , i choose to live in the shadows .
all right , then .
can you get out of this cell ?
only if someone lets me .
no more talking in circles .
answer the question .
are you wondering if that little boy you keep seeing ... is somehow getting the keys and letting me out ?
what little boy ?
now who' s talking in circles ?
clark , i' ve got sara on line one out here .
i' il be right up .
we' il continue this conversation later ?
you can call me ben .
we have to stop meeting like this .
what will the patients say ?
i think it' s a little late for that .
so , did you finish up your interviews ?
basically .
what are you taking ?
oh , i have a cold .
i interviewed all the patients that i was assigned to .
their stories were out there .
mine too .
mrs. idelson told me that the guy from ' wheel of fortune ' did it .
that' s possible .
i had one guy , he' s interesting ... but i don' t think he knows anything .
sic franks on him .
let the cops do the rest .
hang on , i forgot a fork .
what are you doing ?
i' m sorry .
they were sticking out of your purse .
some cold , huh ?
why you taking risperdex ?
here goes .
when i was a little girl i had problems focusing ... and i was later diagnosed with really minor schizophrenia .
but i got put on risperdex and it leveled me out .
i haven' t really had any symptoms since i was a kid .
is that how you got interested in mental health ?
still want to be my friend ?
sure .
crazy chicks are wild .
you jerk .
i' m kidding .
you' re all right now ?
yeah , yeah , i' m fine .
look , don' t tell anyone .
i won' t .
those pills are red .
so ?
the risperdex grace showed me , the pills were blue .
i' m sure a bunch of psychos are on a much stronger dose than i am .
this is the only way out , sara !
carl finally got to go home .
please go to your rooms !
ghosts .
would somebody get dr. franks on the radio !
what happened ?
i was bringing in the games .
we were going to play chutes ' n ' ladders , then this .
maybe he hated chutes ' n ' ladders .
did you see him talking to anyone before he came in ?
he went out to get his medication .
what was he given ?
an antidepressant ?
grace !
was carl just here ?
half hour ago .
did you see him talking to anybody ?
other than himself ?
no .
what did you give him ?
what i always do .
are we starting with q& a again ?
because i don' t have time .
grace , i' m sorry , what did you give him ?
i gave him his usual dose of happy tabs .
thank you .
ben !
i haven' t gone anywhere .
you said something about the medication they gave you .
does it help ?
i wouldn' t know .
i don' t take it .
but i do have a nice mosaic on the wall ...
i' ve done with my unused pills .
but , ben , why don' t you take it ?
they wouldn' t help me if i did .
why not ?
a hospital is a place of business .
when people get better ... there are less bodies in bed .
doesn' t that make sense ?
they give patients weak medication to keep them sick ?
look around you .
the loonies here only seem to get worse .
take your friend carl , for instance .
he took his meds , like a good boy .
and look what happened to him .
how do you know about carl ?
did i say something happened to him ?
i can' t believe you talked me into this .
i need to check out the med station .
i' il be out in 3 minutes .
here they are !
hurry .
let' s get out of here .
why are we doing this ?
i' il send the pills to a friend who works at the university hospital .
i figured whoever' s doing this is on the wrong medication .
look , carl was ready to go home .
according to grace , he was on a huge dose of tranquilizers .
he shouldn' t have been able to get out of bed ... much less hang himself .
what ?
you' re cute when you' re sleuthing .
good night .
good night .
sara ?
there is no place like home .
if franks finds out we' re in his office , we' re screwed .
it was a little boy .
i' ve been seeing him since i got here .
at first i thought it was one of the gardener' s kids .
what ?
you' re sure he isn' t ?
no way .
look ...
i know this sounds strange .
but i think this place actually might be haunted .
i wouldn' t believe it if i hadn' t seen it myself .
but i think alice saw something , and franks , too .
why else would he have these books ?
what ?
it' s just between your theories on the medication , and franks .
now you' re seeing ghosts ?
maybe your surroundings are affecting you .
i' m not crazy , sara .
he was right outside my window .
he looked right at me .
believe me .
okay , okay , i do .
where do they keep the patient records ?
the nurses ' station .
come on .
get your hands off me !
i didn' t kill that bitch !
there' s something you ought to understand .
nothing goes on here that i don' t know or hear about .
then you know that i' il be back for you .
and you , snitch !
you' re next .
i' m going to skin you alive !
nobody' s safe here !
muzzle him .
nobody' s safe !
that poor , troubled boy .
i heard he was raised in a carnival .
now we know where the narcotics disappeared to .
what happened ?
they' re questioning him regarding nurse hendricks ' death .
franks found her taser in his things .
they also found out he had relations with a patient .
who are you ?
clark , you' re there ?
i' m sorry , yes , this is he .
this is tom , from the lab .
hi , tom .
there is no narcotics in the drugs that you gave me .
what ?
just placebos .
all right .
thank you for looking into that .
you were right about the medication .
the risperdex they dispense here is just a placebo .
taking matters into our own hands ?
very aggressive .
i' il call the board first thing monday morning .
one patient is going into psychoses ... and acting out because he' s not getting his meds .
i wouldn' t tell anyone about our discovery until then .
you wouldn' t want franks to cover up their dirty work .
they arrested drake today ... and i don' t think he did it .
i heard hendricks arguing with franks the day she died .
i think he' s connected and she knew about it .
they say the obvious answer usually is the answer .
it' s in front of your eyes .
you have to be willing to see it .
how do you know about everything going on here ?
i' m smart .
be honest with me .
can you get out of this cell ?
let me go out , too !
why do you get out and i don' t ?
only in my mind , royce .
only in my mind .
tell me about the ghost of the little boy .
he' s showing up everywhere now .
he must be fond of you .
you' ve got work to do .
you' d better get back upstairs before you miss any more action .
admittance , diagnosis , release dates .
here' s everything you need .
this is amazing .
great job .
check this out .
here are patients that were rehabbed and released ... since franks took over .
how many ?
none .
none ?
this is unbelievable .
this proves that he keeps patients sick so they can' t go home .
ben london .
cell 44 , schizophrenic , died in 1989 ?
so ?
so he' s not dead .
i talked to him this morning .
you' re losing me .
dr. morton told me about a patient who escaped from cell 44 years ago .
maybe ben was the one who escaped .
and franks tried to cover it up by ... saying he died .
when they got around to catching and bringing him back ...
they never bothered to take him off the deceased list .
exactly .
what are you thinking ?
i don' t know .
you have to be thinking about something .
you can tell me .
we' re in this together .
perfect .
kitchen' s closed !
let me see ... peaches ... gravy , pudding ... meatloaf !
just what the doctor ordered .
pickles ?
pickles .
ketchup .
ketchup , ketchup , ketchup , ketchup , ketchup .

who are you ?
it' s clark .
what did you do to me ?
where am i ?
what' s happening to me ?
it' s okay .
sara , look at me .
i work with you at the hospital .
do you remember ?
look , i think you forgot to take your medication .
take a couple of these and it will be better .
i' m sorry .
it' s okay .
i just can' t figure out ... what' s real and what' s a dream .
come on .
come here .
all right .
... coming to the area late today ... bringing along chances of thunderstorm and low temperatures .
and now , for more informations on our top story ...
lets go back to peter garcia .
sheriff johnson warns that the escaped suspect ... who was detained on suspicion of murder ... should be considered armed and dangerous .
he' s known to go by the alias of drake anderson .
anderson is 5 foot 10 , has dark brown hair ... and sports the tattoo of a spider on his neck .
anyone with information leading to his capture ... should report it to the kirkside sheriff' s department .
what happened ?
thank god you' re okay .
someone killed dr. morton .
what ?
i' m scared .
i don' t know who to trust anymore .
drake got out .
what ?
i heard it on the radio .
he escaped last night .
if it was him , then he' s probably long gone .
they searched this whole place with a fine tooth comb .
that investigator wants to ask us a few questions .
not now .
i' m going to talk to franks .
what ?
i' m going to talk to franks !
open the goddamn door !
franks , i know you' re in there !
open the door !
jesus !
it isn' t drake .
what are you talking about ?
i asked the cops and they said he was arrested 20 minutes ago .
he stole a car in dallas .
i' m leaving .
wait , wait .
i don' t know what' s going on here .
come with me if you want , but i' m not staying .
okay .
okay .
wait , i' il go .
come with me to the office and i' il grab a few things .
come on .
i want to be sure security ... can keep the patients locked down .
they won' t be safe here .
nobody will be safe here .
i' il tell betty we' re going .
fine .
but make it quick .
i want to get as far away as possible .
i will .
we' il be okay .
nothing will happen with all those cops hanging outside .
here .
what if it' s not a person doing all this ?
what do you mean ?
what if it' s like morton said ?
what if something happened in the building ... and it' s never forgotten ?
clark ... it was a person .
and if it was a patient , they' re all in lockdown .
we' re fine .
now go back .
i' il just finish up around here .
it' s right in front of your eyes .
clark , are you there ?
right in front of your eyes .
i just can' t figure out ... what' s real and what' s a dream .
i was diagnosed with schizophrenia .
sara .
thanks for your help , officer .
also , i have a list of patients .
i' il leave it in a red folder in my outbox .
not a problem .
you have my cell number .
okay , all right , thank you .
why did you drug me ?
i just gave you a calmative .
you were acting really strange .
it was you .
i should' ve figured it out the other night when you had ... your relapse .
you' re wrong .
ben told me the answer was right in front of my eyes .
who ?
cell 44 .
ben london .
he must have seen you the night you killed nurse hendricks .
that' s why he told me the answer was right in front of my eyes .
there' s no one in cell 44 .
don' t lie to me .
it' s used for storage .
you were the one who told me ... never to trust a schizo .
i can prove he' s there .
there you are .
i' ve been looking for you .
is something wrong ?
ben !
ben !
ben , what' s going on ?
why didn' t you tell me it was sara ?
i' m going to let you out of here .
so you can get someplace safe .
but i want to see your face .
i suppose it' s time to go home .
that kid i keep seeing running around the halls ?
it' s a little strange that he runs around here at night .
maybe your surroundings are starting to affect you .
i' m not crazy , sara .
now you know what madness feels like .
that' s a feeling you' il never forget .
hey , good looking .
we' ve got work to do .
boys are not toys , les !
he was the sickest patient that i ever come across .
there you are .
i' ve been looking for you .
you need to teach you some respect !
what i' d love to do is change this place for the better .
that' s really why i came here .
betty , go to one .
have my car sent around .
where are my keys to the medication ?
never mind .
