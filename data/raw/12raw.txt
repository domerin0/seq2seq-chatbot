what is this ?
hey !
what' s going on ?
all the satellite signals are gone !
get someone here , quick !
lam , call engineering and have them check the backups .
sorry to call you back on your wedding day .
what is it ?
the end of the world ?
some big shit like that !
what is it then ?
all the satellite signals were disconnected .
only the underwater cables are still functioning .
stanley station is still checking the backups .
hong kong # 1 is down , we couldn' t get signals from # 2 and # 4 , and # 6 is toasted .
what should we do ?
call the doctor .
we still haven' t found him .
oh !
he' s over there !
hello ?
dr. ken !
what is it ?
i' ve been trying to call you .
something major is going down at stanley !
mr. ken , mr. john is already here .
the satellite signal was completely down for 30 minutes .
it' s back to normal now , but all the backups are gone .
lnitial investigation shows no signs of sabotage .
as for the breakdown , we simply couldn' t determine the cause .
you' il have to figure that out .
thank you so much .
let' s go .
that' s it !
what did the observatory say ?
the sunspots showed no irregular activities in the past 24 hours , and there' re no record of planetary explosions .
even guangzhou and shenzhen reported nothing special .
ln other words , it only happened in hong kong .
look , even the server is toasted .
we should' ve easily detected such high levels of energy .
yes , i understand .
i understand perfectly , but ...
but you know we can' t operate without a backup system !
we' il create our own if we have to !
right ...
call the insurance company right away .
well ? ls clarence still upset ?
you would be too if it were you .
but i don' t think anyone needs to be responsible .
the antenna was wrecked by him .
looks like the insurance company will suffer the most .
they' il lose their pants !
mr. ken said it' d be a few more minutes .
did you tell him this is regarding his own life ?
i did , but he' s dealing with something even more important .
more important than his own life ?
that' s what he said !
wait .
excuse me !
why are you here ?
why are you here ?
my buddy called me here !
chiu tai pang , from sun leung tam , cld .
nice to meet you .
detective chiu , you' re here !
boss said to see him the moment you' re here .
detective chiu !
it' s okay .
i know them .
what shit are you in now , classmate ?
so many cops here to see you .
mr. chan .
lnspector yip , james from the uk .
hello !
how do you do ?
take a seat .
what can i do for you ?
ln the past 3 months , 3 scientists had died mysteriously .
they all had one thing in common .
they were voted " top ten future leaders " by century magazine .
mr. ken , were you on that list as well ?
we have reasons to believe that your life is in danger .
so this flimsy piece of paper is the " top ten future leaders " certificate ?
so this flimsy piece of paper is the " top ten future leaders " certificate ?
yup !
any prize money ?
nope .
let me explain this to you , big eyes .
do you know each year the u. n. chooses only 10 people as mankind' s future leaders ?
i was one of them , and also the first chinese ever selected .
what' s so smart about you then ?
i' il make it simple for you .
before , it took this size of cable to transmit data .
now , this will do the trick .
ls that it ?
that' s it !
then i have something here that' d make you even happier !
what is it ?
congratulations , mr. ken , you' ve been awarded ...
best boyfriend of the year " !!
aren' t you a happier man now ?
are you proud ?
any prize money ?
no .
prizes ?
nope .
no way !
i' ve got to have something !
mr. ken .
mr. ken ?
have you ever heard of a group called " brotherhood of technology " ?
uh ... no .
never mind .
really , i' ve never heard of them , and i' ve never received anything from this group .
hold it .
are you taking his statements ?
what' s the charge ?
you don' t have to answer them .
you' re a cop too .
don' t interfere with our work .
i' m off duty now , and i' m speaking as his friend .
we do not suspect mr. ken .
we' re just concerned about his safety .
do you know liam anderson ?
i do .
he died last night .
why wasn' t this announced ?
we have to keep it confidential because his death was very peculiar .
mr. ken , let me ask you once again .
where were you at around 10 : 30 last night ?
that was when our satellite signal went down !
the antenna was burnt at around that time .
by the way , madam , why was mr. anderson in hong kong ?
we' re not too sure either .
he was reported missing in edinburgh , and was selected as chairman of global bank just last month .
ml6 has always thought he was kidnapped by terrorists .
was he rich ?
not really , but he' s influential enough to control half of europe' s cash flow .
wow , that was one hell of an explosion !
really ?
hey , detective chiu !
are you transferred back to the city ?
did you get promoted ?
promoted ?
you' ve got to be kidding .
i wish .
my superiors asked me to forward these to some big shot .
turns out that big shot is you !
i mean , i have a higher ranking , a better paycheck , and a bigger condo .
but you' re the man !
hey , detective , is it an in thing now just to wear the gun case ?
ls the info here ?
who are you ?
these are confidential !
ah ... dr. ken !
he is dr. ken tit sun .
dr. ken ?
don' t you specialize in information transmission technology ?
i don' t suppose you' re an expert in forensics ?
i' m just doing research .
please ...
thanks .
obviously , there was an explosion at the scene .
according to witnesses ' statements , they think that the explosives were already attached to the victim' s body .
was anybody else there at the time ?
did anyone else get hurt ?
well ... one was over here , the other one was over there .
but they' re both lucky .
they only received slight burns on the skin .
according to the record , mr. anderson weighed about 175 pounds , but his identifiable remains totaled less than 10 pounds .
that includes a portion of the liver , one section of the spine , one complete left foot , and a shoe and sock that were hardly torched .
there' s also his skull , but it' s completely deformed .
a deformed skull ?
sure !
the skull is the hardest part of the body .
it' s more difficult to alter it .
you need at least 3000 degrees celsius to perform cremation .
the explosion only lasted half a second .
it must' ve been really powerful !
have you performed an autopsy on his spine , liver and skull ?
yes .
it' s all in here .
does the report state that the inside was burnt , but the outside was normal ?
bingo !
perfect !
were there any traces of explosives ?
well , that' s the oddest thing .
a ml6 member claimed that he saw the victim' s bible catching fire first .
but all was not burnt .
the last chapter remains .
as for traces of explosives , we couldn' t find any near the crime scene .
did you notice the sticky grease stain ?
we' re running it through the lab .
we think it' s only burnt lard .
do you think it' s human ?
are you serious ?
you mean this ??
i believe it' s spontaneous combustion .
the u. s. has recorded cases of spontaneous combustion as early as 1952 .
the evidence was very similar to the ones at the tower .
but how can someone just explode ?
the human body consists mostly of water .
water is h2o .
both hydrogen and oxygen are the most inflammable substances .
why can' t there be an explosion ?
what caused the explosion then ?
even though there had been a few instances , no reasonable explanation can be found .
did mr. anderson die of natural causes ?
i don' t know .
but , if someone can somehow cause another human to combust , and if that person wants to kill me , i don' t think anyone can protect me .
i do not wish to be followed by strangers .
furthermore , i don' t believe someone' s trying to kill me .
the police are just concerned about your safety , mr. ken .
i know .
i think you just want a cop to protect me , to show your boss that you' ve done your jobs .
tai pang will do !
this time i must agree with him .
this shit is huge , and you want me to protect you ?
you' re playing with your life !
you better ask for a ml6 .
no , really .
detective chiu !
sorry , mr. ken .
this gentleman claimed to be from tak ying sauna .
he said he must say something very important to detective chiu in person .
hey !
how' s the assignment coming along ?
detective chiu !
i' ve told you to wait outside for me , man !
i better give this to you personally , sir .
i did great this time , didn' t l ?
not bad , huh ?
janis , show this gentleman out .
sir , this way .
hey , didn' t you say you' ve got some ...
v stuff , some real powerful shit ?
can i see it ?
sure !
ask teresa to show you around .
your company has quite a setup !
lots of staff !
were you mr. ken' s classmate back in cambridge ?
which field were you in ?
it' s true that we' re old classmates ... back in elementary school .
but it' s quite a famous school .
it' s all my old man' s fault .
i couldn' t get in high school because he didn' t get the janitor job .
wow !
this hdtv tank looks real !
such high resolution !
do you need to feed them with electric worms ?
you can still laugh even though it' s not funny .
any progress from the police investigation ?
we believe that the murders are all related to brotherhood of technology .
mr. ken , are you sure you haven' t receive any solicitation from this group ?
this doesn' t make sense .
all members of this organization are renowned scientists .
are you saying that i' m lying ?
that' s not what i meant .
he' s a genius .
many call him the modern freud .
he' s an outstanding psychiatrist .
he' s also the head of a scientific consortium .
we suspect that he is the leader of brotherhood of technology .
i don' t think this group is after money , because billy conners is already one of the top ten billionaires .
we' re both scientists , but i am a lot poorer !
i' ve decided on tai pang .
besides him , i don' t need anybody else to protect me .
ok . lf you have so much faith in detective chiu , we are more than happy to have him protect you .
lf you need anything else , just call us .
have you noticed anything odd in sun' s behavior after that ?
after what ?
after adele' s death !
nothing odd .
everything seems normal .
did he skip work at all ?
then why did he go sailing yesterday ?
it' s normal to go sailing on sundays .
think about it .
lf your boyfriend just passed away , wouldn' t you just stay home and cry your heart out ?
would you still go to work at all ?
he' s being normal in a most abnormal way .
janis .
yes ?
do you have any painkillers ?
sure .
boss .
after i' m tired of panadol , i' il try aspirin .
why not try some chocolate ?
it' s not healthy to take so many pills .
you' re so silly !
this is not instant coffee .
you need to use a coffeepot !
wait !
you need a filter too .
thanks .
let me help you .
takes me forever just to make a cup of coffee .
no kidding .
ls that enough ?
are you new here ?
yes .
today is only my third day .
what is your name ?
my name is adele .
a d e l e , with a stroke above the last e .
my french teacher chose the name for me .
very annoying , isn' t it ?
very .
by the way , i can make you coffee when i make one for my boss later .
who' s your boss ?
his last name is ken .
then you can just make one for your boss .
mr. ken .
so ... you are adele ?
you are mr. ken .
mr. ken , i' il bring the coffee to your room when it' s ready .
fine .
thanks .
mr. ken .
what is it , mr. ken ?
this is for you .
are you free for dinner tonight ?
i' m sorry , but i have classes tonight .
how about tomorrow night ?
fine .
i' m leaving .
bye .
everything here is firewall protected to prevent our computer systems from hackers breaking in .
just seeing all these rolls of wiring gives me the creeps .
teresa .
clarence .
ls mr. ken back yet ?
he' s in his office .
let me introduce .
this is clarence , our systems director .
he' s also mr. ken' s classmate .
how do you do ?
this is detective chiu , mr. ken' s bodyguard .
ls mr. ken in trouble ?
nothing major .
so you' ve known him for quite some time ?
yes , ever since our university days .
do you recall him offending any person lately ?
sure , tons of them .
once our vod becomes popular , many computer guys would need a career change .
have you noticed anything unusual about him lately ?
well , there had been some minor mistakes on his recent orders , and mr. ken seldom makes mistakes .
i' il have to go find mr. ken .
ok .
thanks .
anything else to see ?
let' s get this over with .
something that will blow you away .
what is it ?
vod .
once you' ve installed our video on demand system , your home tv would turn from one way into a two way communication .
miss wong .
so what' s the fuss about vod ?
it' s just a tv set !
just listen to her .
it will allow you to watch the movie you want just by entering a code .
this is nothing new .
you can register by phone and then follow the movie time slot .
what you' re referring to is limited by the time slot .
with vod , you can watch it whenever you like .
it' s two different things .
so stop interrupting her , dumbass !
furthermore , with vod movies , you can fast forward , pause , and rewind , just like watching it on videotape .
besides movies , you can also surf the net , do grocery shopping or shop for other things online .
lf combined with the use of a smart card , you can even transfer your money from your bank .
it' s very convenient .
you' d need a big bunch of wires for so many functions .
it' s not convenient at all !
a man like you can be so ignorant .
all you need is a phone line .
i' m just talking to myself , woman .
mind your own business .
don' t pretend to be an expert .
how can a phone line that thin carry so many functions ?
ask the professionals if you don' t believe me !
actually , this lady is right .
the greatest breakthrough of our vod is that it uses just one single fiber optic line .
see ?
even she agrees that you don' t know anything !
why , you ... you ...
elaine , please continue .
so uneducated !
mr. ken pages us to a meeting in the war room .
war room ? ls that a place for wars ?
almost .
this is where we do our research and analysis .
only a few people have access .
you' ve met clarence .
this is kim .
he has several doctorate degrees .
i can also read your fortune .
i' m good at that .
i' m tc .
i used to be in pathology .
but not anymore .
ls orange juice ok ?
sun , have you offended anyone lately ?
there' il soon be many .
once we launch our vod , every telecommunication company will be affected .
such as ?
such as networks , video distributors , and lnternet service providers .
especially lsp' s .
my feelings exactly .
lf someone wants mr. ken dead ,
i suppose it would be those internet or software development firms .
that' s a lot of people !
not really .
only the top five firms would feel most threatened by mr. ken .
teresa , search the net for the list of top level managers from these firms .
sure .
it can' t be that serious .
vod is television .
it' s different from computers .
they' re not that different .
tv is family entertainment .
but lnternet is for one individual .
it' s like salt and sugar .
would you substitute salt for sugar ?
besides , there' re bankers , doctors , and chemists among the victims .
they may not be just pinpointing me .
so ?
so what ? lf the murderers can kill by spontaneous combustion , then there' s nothing i can do to prevent them from killing me .
why waste your time thinking about this ?
are you that smart ?
sorry .
what is it ?
nothing .
let' s eat !
are you sure you can cook ?
why not ?
my specialty is not studying , but making instant noodles .
i was one of the " ten best lnstant noodles " winners in college .
then you' il do the cooking from now on .
but they withdrew the prize afterwards .
they said that i cheated .
let' s get married .
you' re nuts .
the more reason to get married .
hey , don' t move around .
i don' t want to , that' s why i want to get married .
come on .
you will regret it !
i won' t know that until after the wedding .
fine !
but first , you have to gain 10 pounds .
no problem .
i want to spend our honeymoon in prague .
no problem .
i' il book the tickets tomorrow .
also , i' il only marry a guy who has an afro hairdo .
like that ?
close .
forget it then .
let' s continue .
damn you !
no need to guess .
those are the prague tickets .
i' ve gained 3 pounds , and i' ve booked the flights .
as for the hairdo ...
i' ve got a sample .
the stylist should know what to do !
do you have any vacation left ?
of course !
that' s right .
senior staff like you have flexible time off .
junior staff like me don' t have such luxuries .
that' s right .
what should we do ?
we' il have to wait .
i' il return the tickets .
don' t you dare !
how long is the trip ?
2 weeks ?
you' ve even got a small dock down there .
that kills me .
that' s really cute .
i' ve always felt that your house is like a morgue .
metal everywhere .
some wood would help .
roundtrip tickets for two to prague ?
it' s about to expire .
return them !
why did you leave them here ?
don' t waste them .
don' t touch my stuff .
better get a refund soon .
might as well use the money on dinner .
don' t touch my stuff !
why are you so upset ?
she' s been dead for so long .
why hang on to them ?
for decoration ?
they' re not even pretty !
why do you care ?
why did you ask me to come here ?
what the hell do you need me for ?
i' m useless to you .
your duty is to protect me .
are you crazy ??
protect you ?
i don' t know jack shit about your hi tech , body explosion stuff .
i' m just a cop !
you think i' m a scientist ? !
ask those ml6 guys to protect you then !
i' m only here to chat with you , man !
you just want to die !
that' s easy .
just bang your head on the wall .
no need to wait til you explode !
why drag me into this ?
lf you want to die , do it on your own .
you should know what i mean .
are you hungry ?
i just don' t know what to do with you !
of course i' m hungry .
i haven' t eaten all day .
what would you like ?
i' il bring you to a nice place .
do you trust me ?
the vendors are still here .
they' il be gone if you don' t come here often enough .
what do you want ?
hurry up with your orders .
combination noodles .
shrimp noodles for me .
no onions .
hey !
i know you two !
it took you long enough !
you need new glasses !
eat some more .
go away !!
get lost !
no , no ... l can' t take your money .
careful .
it' s hot !
let' s eat .
wow !
this is really spicy !
i thought you always wanted extra spicy .
you can' t take this now ?
you could when you were younger !
hey , i didn' t order sausage !
it' s on the house .
then at least give me more than just two slices .
what a miser !
you haven' t changed a bit , especially that big mouth of yours .
did you finish school ?
what are you up to now ?
lnstalling antennas .
that bad ?
no wonder you look so sad .
nobody uses antennas nowadays .
even i don' t use it .
don' t you worry .
those antennas are still big in china and vietnam .
plenty of chances , young man !
combination noodles !
can' t you wait a minute ?
why not tell him how much you really have ?
eat your noodles !
where were we ?
you were lecturing him .
do continue .
he' s really depressed .
right .
it doesn' t matter what you do , as long as you are happy .
just take a look at my noodle place .
many rich folks come to eat here .
whenever i' m off , they' il have to settle for those wonton noodles next door .
those noodles are just plain shit !
where' s your daughter ?
don' t even talk about her .
but you do have a daughter ...
i said , don' t even talk about her !
young people nowadays ...
at least you two still remember me .
nostalgia is a good thing !
don' t look so sad .
your noodles ?
my treat !
what about mine ?
of course you have to pay , big mouth !
i have to get back to work .
this world stinks more and more by the day .
not as bad as your mouth .
maybe , but it has a sweet taste .
want to try ?
that' s it .
smile and you won' t blow up .
motherfucker !
pay up !
pay up !
why won' t you pay up ?
none of your business !
police !
freeze !
police !
stop fighting !
thanks .
what' s with you ?
you and that ml6 dog are always following us .
where is he now ?
you think it' s easy to follow you around ?
but we are really concerned about mr. ken' s safety .
maybe you' re worried about my competence even more .
i' m watching him , but you' re watching me .
do you want me to screw up in front of ml6 ?
but you did screw up , didn' t you ?
try not to protect your image all the time .
yes , madam .
you' re the boss .
madam , you' re here !
your lab report is already out .
have you got it ?
i' ve got it .
thanks .
what report ?
were you not feeling well ?
hey ... what lab report ?
there is no sign of fracture or hemorrhage in your skull .
lf that' s the case , can i be discharged ?
lf you stay one more night , we can make sure that there is no future damage to your brain .
we' il arrange to have this patient transferred to another ward .
just stay here and rest .
it' s for your protection .
but i really want to go home .
please be patient .
get some rest .
hey , you .
got into a fight ?
did it hurt ?
no .
did you throw up ?
no .
then you should be fine .
you can leave .
i get hit on the head a lot .
my mom said i' il be fine as long as i don' t throw up .
it' s only pain .
you' il be alright .
relax .
what' s your name ?
my last name is ken .
i asked for your name , not just your last name !
what' s wrong with you ?
sorry .
my name is tit sun .
my name is brother chuen .
how do you do ?
how do you do ?
why did they tie you up ?
lsn' t that obvious enough ?
i' m crazy .
i bite people .
they want to get chucky .
so i bit them .
who' s chucky ?
chucky is very famous .
he barks really loud .
all other dogs are scared of him .
you look ugly when you laugh .
let me tell you something really funny .
my mother lost a bet .
she often said that she would live longer than i would .
but this time , i won .
she went to bed 2 days ago and never woke up .
the doctor told me she' s dead .
do you miss her ?
of course .
but i can only miss her for a while each day .
i' m really busy , you know .
i have to check on those hawkers at the market everyday for fraud .
and i have to make sure that cars won' t hit the kids when they cross .
i even have to feed chucky .
damn !
i wonder if chucky ate breakfast this morning ?
have you got a girlfriend ?
yes , a while ago .
there is a nurse here .
she' s really pretty .
she wears a mickey mouse watch .
my mom said that i' m all grown up now .
i really would like to start a relationship .
what is it then ?
nothing .
then why did you come here for a lab test ?
just for fun ?
come on , tell me about it .
x ray reveals a black spot in my stomach .
the doctor suspected cancer , so he took some samples for analysis .
what did the report say ?
it can' t be cancer .
you don' t even smoke or drink !
you should be fine .
don' t be like this .
the doctor said that the black spot is only food that' s not digested .
he said i should cut down on pickled eggs .
you had me all worried !
i apologize , mr. ken .
we' il transfer him now .
there' s no need .
we got along pretty well .
that' s right .
we' re friends .
your name is sunny .
i forgot my business cards .
this is my business card .
call me if you need any help .
why would i need help ?
i' m the one who help others .
lf anyone bullies you here , just say that you know me .
i' m notorious around here .
thank you so much .
you' re too corny .
i' m not talking to you anymore !
are you transferring me to another room or not ?
right .
let' s go .
sorry , mr. ken .
remember .
just tell them that you know me .
sun , did you bump your head ?
does it hurt ?
what is it ?
have you seen adele ?
what ?
lmpossible !
adele was just here !
it' s just your delusion .
no !
i even felt her touch .
she was standing right there !
alright .
you get some sleep .
i' il call the doctor .
lie down .
this card was not here before !
ask the hospital staff if they saw anyone leaving it here .
how could this be ?
this address is top secret .
that' s where mr. sato is .
sato ? !
the one who did the biology l . c. research ?
yes .
it was he who told us about brotherhood of technology .
he' s under ml6' s protection .
it' s impossible that anyone else would have known this address .
help !
help !!
madam !
they were never out of this room .
and there' s nothing here .
what' s the burning smell ?
i don' t know .
it' s the smell of human flesh !
did you see mr. sato ?
he' s gone !
how could he just disappear ?
spontaneous combustion again ?
doesn' t look like it .
lf it is , the people beside him would still be alive .
well ?
human explosion again ?
i' il take a look .
sam !
please let me go , dr. ken .
sorry .
please wait .
lvy , let me do the forensics this time .
kim has already called someone from the hong kong university .
dr. ken , you should follow the rules .
james asked us to do the forensics .
but james is not here yet .
madam , this will look bad for our department .
do you want the truth or not ?
dr. yip !
dr. wong !
dr. lau !
so are you the expert or are we the experts ?
of course you are .
you were all my teachers .
i' il give you a report in two days .
how about this , dr. yip ?
let me check it out first .
i' il let you examine after i' m done .
then what' s there left for us to examine ?
our objective is to preserve the crime scene' s original state .
i taught you that !
sam , give us a hand .
coming !
according to the first witness and our own observations , the door was locked when the incident happened .
there were two corpses in the room .
but mr. sato had vanished .
we found a large sum of cash and his credit cards .
also , the suit which mr. sato was last seen wearing was scattered all over the place .
but there were no signs of struggle .
this proves that the probability of a forced abduction was very low .
lf he has really left the place , it must be either voluntary , or he must have been unconscious .
as for the autopsy report on the two ml6 members , the cause of death was heart failure .
all the other major organs simply failed simultaneously .
i' ve never done an autopsy on a cooked corpse before .
they were microwaved to 80 % well done .
they smelled like bbq pork when i cut them open .
you don' t have to be that detailed .
what else ?
since the bodies were microwaved from the inside , all internal organs were cooked .
therefore , there were no bacteria to determine time of death .
the skin ...
can you just skip to your conclusion ?
even though i couldn' t find any evidence from the corpses ,
i could still estimate their time of death to be around 10 to 10 : 07 pm .
without any evidence , how could you be so sure ?
i imagined putting a 180lb piece of meat in a huge microwave oven , and calculated the time it takes to cook the meat .
as simple as that !
our satellite also ceased to receive signals for 15 seconds at 10 : 06 : 32 pm .
it closely matches the time of death .
we' ve also checked the oven .
surprisingly , its microwave power exceeded its original design by ten times .
how could that be ?
i' d like to know that myself .
this doesn' t fit any scientific logic .
we found a large amount of ashes and crystallized substances at the scene .
from the analysis , they contain 3 elements .
they are organic compound , protein , and the third ?
minerals .
are you telling me that the japanese did not disappear ?
correct !
theoretically , add 80 % of water , and " it " will turn back into a human being .
what could' ve done this ?
beats me !
lf you dehydrate a person , he should only turn into a dry corpse at the most .
but now we are seeing an actual , dissolved substance .
just like being shot dead by laser guns in a cartoon .
hey man , i' m only kidding .
he' s referring to assault satellites .
there are now more than 800 satellites orbiting the earth .
we only know the true usage of half of them .
the rest are all classified military satellites .
my knowledge is that the u. s. government has already tested laser and particle beam from these satellites successfully .
it' s not too difficult to check .
we can match the time of the incident with the positions of the satellites hovering above hong kong at that time .
dr. yip , i still don' t understand .
i' ve handled a lot of crime scenes .
normally , when there are multiple bodies in a common crime scene , their cause of death is usually the same .
so why did the japanese dissolve into ashes , but not the other two guys ?
one exploded , and the other turned into ashes .
what about the other two guys ?
james didn' t say anything about their deaths .
actually , even james himself didn' t know .
one guy' s lranian , and the other was russian .
their cause of death was never announced .
why does killing people have to be this fancy ?
maybe they are experimenting .
i think someone is trying to show off .
mr. sato might know more .
but he is dead .
our computers have always communicated with his .
we can try breaking into his system .
a break in ?
that' s illegal !
do you have a better suggestion ?
this is too big for us to handle .
cops !
cops !
cops !
cops , gator !
are you mr. yao ?
cld .
what ...
these are just games !
no x rated stuff !
you can arrest me , but please don' t beat me up .
we need your help .
sir , please don' t play games with me .
how can small potatoes like us help you ?
but you are gator , aren' t you ?
are you crazy ?
gator my ass !
all i have are dead cpu' s .
uncle , you can stop pretending .
i brought them here .
you little piece of shit !
you betrayed me !!
you' re asking for a beating !
fine !
you can forget about descrambling all those japanese porno discs of yours !
you little shit !
mr. yao , i urged kim to bring me here .
i' m ken tit sun .
but you are so young !
you' re good !
you did something even the japanese and americans couldn' t .
transmitting video with just one single phone line .
smart !
you are truly a smart ass !
i need your help to save my life .
save your life ?
this japanese system is known for its superb firewalls .
that' s why we need your help , uncle .
lf you can break into his system , you' il become a legend overnight .
even the japanese will be running scared when they hear your name .
you are running scared now !
you' re always bragging about your hacking skills .
you try breaking in then .
we have the technology , but we don' t have the expertise like you do .
that' s true .
i can' t match you when it comes to building things , but when it comes to breaking in ...
hey , wait a minute .
this is illegal .
you' ve always been breaking the law .
we only break small laws .
we don' t break big ones .
i don' t want handcuffs on my wrists .
madam , it' s your turn to speak .
our main objective is to protect mr. ken .
we' il turn our backs on anything else .
right .
she saw nothing .
thanks .
i must really learn from gator this time .
i have one condition though .
i want a picture with you , so i can hang it on my storefront .
sure .
ok .
andy , you handle the hardware .
i' il need 20 terminal linkups , the fastest modems and printers .
you need to help me put together a hard disk of at least 20 gigs .
because i don' t know how much memory their system has .
you help me copy these 20 hacker programs into the terminals .
the rest of you will help me with the cables and monitors , ok ?
ok !
any questions ?
no .
dismiss !
done ?
all set !
lf the correct password is not entered within the first 15 minutes , the firewall will activate immediately .
lf we try to break in manually , it could take forever .
it' s easy because that japanese was a scientist .
scientists have a logical way of thinking .
the same goes for their passwords .
also , check out his surroundings and what he likes .
you can' t go wrong .
what if his computer randomly chose the password for him ?
we have three pcs working on that right now .
wish us luck !
everyone , on your mark .
set ... go !
i' m out of codes !
what' s that ?
something about japanese baseball .
we' ve used up their usernames !
keep entering some more !
the machine just hangs !
porn stars ?
let me !
there goes my reputation !
hey , check this out .
what is it ?
what the hell did you enter ?
don' t know .
i just randomly picked a phrase from here .
the final war between good and evil " ?
these are all buddhist scriptures .
nostradamus .
what does it mean ?
he was a very famous french prophet .
he predicted armageddon .
could this be a prank from sato ?
these are all from the bible , the koran , and the sutra .
but they all share the same theme , and that is the religion' s prediction for armageddon .
buddhism emphasizes the idea of a beginning and an end , that there must be an end before there is a beginning .
sounds like karma , but also sounds like armageddon .
the buddhist sutra reveals that the great wheel will turn once every 2, 000 years .
each time it turns , earth will encounter a big disaster .
and it' s now 1997 .
aren' t you scared , pal ?
ln japan , the sun moon god also talks about armageddon .
the gods will descend from the heavens after 3, 000 years to destroy not only the world , but also the spiritual world .
ln the koran , a large portion is devoted to armageddon .
it even predicts precisely that in july of 1999 ,
the king of horror will descend upon the earth .
the bible' s book of revelations said that there are seven signs that precede armageddon .
maybe it has something to do with our case .
the first sign the antichrist will appear in the name of satan .
on that day , the fiery mountains will sink into the oceans .
one third of the sea will turn into blood , and one third of the creatures in the sea will die .
even one third of all ships will be destroyed .
some believe that sadaam hussein is the antichrist .
and the persian gulf war matches the scenarios in revelations .
the second sign a star that burns like a torch will descend from the sky , and fall into 1/ 3 of the world' s rivers .
the star is called " wormwood " .
the river will become bitter , and because of that , many will die .
wormwood " is a kind of herbs , but it' s also known by its nickname ,
chernobyl " .
the same name as the soviet nuclear power plant that suffered a meltdown .
the third sign the reappearance of the kingdom of babylon .
the layout of babylon is very similar to that of modern day europe .
and i' m sure you all know about the unification talks .
the fourth sign the reappearance of the temple of jerusalem .
remember mr. anderson ?
his will stated that 50 billion british pounds under his name will be automatically donated to jerusalem' s temple restoration efforts .
noah' s ark will also reappear .
as for mr. sato , he was dedicated to collecting dna from each and every living creatures on earth .
he didn' t want any of them to become extinct .
then ...
it' s just like the noah' s ark theory , isn' t it ?
the sixth sign there will be a big earthquake .
the moon will turn red , and all the stars will fall .
the seventh sign " who does not believe in me will turn to me when the day comes " .
on judgement day , everything without the seal of god will all be destroyed .
five of the seven signs had already appeared .
you can say that chernobyl and saddam hussein are just coincidences .
but the rest seems to have been done by man .
could this be the work of some mad scientist , using the bible as an excuse ?
think so ?
would someone be that dumb as to kill himself by creating armageddon ?
that' s why i said he' s mad .
how can we read a madman' s mind ?
are you guys scientists or what ?
all this superstitious babbling !
do you know " feng shui " too ?
i need it for my home .
sure .
give me your date of birth .
there are many things that can' t be explained with science .
there' s no point in arguing .
i think the answer lies on this card .
although i can' t be sure how this card appears ,
i am very sure that adele is dead .
so what ?
they used a ghost to give me the card .
what ?
a ghost ?
she touched my head with her hand .
i could actually feel her body warmth .
i tried to catch her , but she simply vanished .
did you actually touch her ?
no .
but i don' t believe it' s a dream .
i don' t think you can feel body warmth in dreams .
mr. ken , you are a scientist yourself .
do you believe in ghosts ?
i don' t know .
that' s why i need your help .
besides this incident , have you ever seen adele in your dreams ?
yes .
how many times ?
many .
i think it' s just pressure from your work .
steve , don' t give me this work pressure bullshit .
don' t tell me i' m having illusions because i miss adele too much .
even if they are , then how do you explain the card ?
do you think i made it up ?
i don' t even know how to make up things like that !
calm down .
i can' t help you if you act like this .
rest a bit , please .
well ?
i still think that he is mixing reality with his illusions .
have a drink .
what does that mean ?
ls he losing his mind ?
he is just being hyper .
urbanites are a bunch of nervous wrecks .
and the card ?
how do you explain that ?
even he himself can' t be sure it' s adele who left the card .
the card' s origin and adele' s appearance are two separate issues .
do you guys really believe that he saw adele' s ghost ?
tai pang ...
say it .
don' t come over !
don' t be scared , you all .
don' t come near me !
i' ve got a gun !
it' s me , tai pang .
put your gun down .
it' s me !
sun .
watch the door .
lvy !
be careful .
i don' t know what she is !
why are you here ?
i don' t know .
i really don' t know .
do you remember the past ?
when' s your birthday ?
june 20th .
and mine ?
july 21st .
remember your first words to me ?
you' re so silly !
now what ?
does this mean we' re all urban psychos ?
sunny baby , i am adele .
i miss you so much .
did adele ever call you " sunny baby " ?
this is not your girlfriend .
not her .
fine , you can go .
you' re in the wrong body .
but i' m not done .
yes , you are .
your money' s outside .
thanks .
we' il pay you outside .
fine , as long as i get paid .
i' ve told you this wouldn' t work .
you' re wasting money .
it' s just a try .
mr. ken , he' s the spiritual advisor recommended by my friend .
this house is really haunted .
hey , peter .
when did you become a psychic ?
wow !
turns out this house is haunted by cops !
sorry , detective chiu !
i' m going !
it' s been a long day .
you must all be tired .
go home .
come on !
maybe all these people here scared her off .
i' il find you an even more powerful psychic later .
how come the name is changed ? !
she' s been here .
tickets to prague in 2 days ?
why is my name on it ?
i think someone wants us to go to prague .
this is too spooky for me .
i' m not going !
i' m telling you .
you can count me out .
whatever .
don' t you talk to me like that !
i' m really not going !
how come it' s so cold ? !
my toes are all frozen !
what the hell did i do wrong ?
why am i here in prague ?
i said i wasn' t coming !!
why did you do this to me ?
adele and i thought of getting married here .
therefore , it' s not odd for her to meet me here .
you think i haven' t done my research ?
i' ve checked the travel agency .
they said the tickets were booked under your company' s name .
maybe someone in your office is pulling a prank on you .
could it be janis ?
there are so many personnel in my company .
anyone could' ve used our name and booked the tickets .
i trust janis more than i trust you .
then why didn' t you ask janis to come ? !
do we have to check each and every church here in prague ?
adele really liked the churches here .
why can' t she pick the tropics or some place warmer ?
why prague ?
here' s your hot drink .
it' s freezing !
exactly !
what the hell are we here for ??
you , maybe .
but why me ??
she' s not even my girl !
don' t get mad .
after the drink , we' il start from the first church again .
give it a chance .
it shouldn' t be hard to find a chinese girl here ...
you mean a chinese ghost !
you' il have better luck at the cemetery !
cemetery ? !
you' re right .
i know ... now i know why she wants you here .
i' m just kidding , man .
come on .
i' m only kidding !
me and my big mouth !
there' s hardly any ghost here .
can we go now ?
let' s walk some more .
how about this ?
we' il wait here till they close the gates .
you' re kidding !
i can barely walk .
there' s no way i can just stand and wait .
jog on the same spot then .
adele , if you really want to see me , just reveal yourself .
hey !
you can' t take off your hat here .
sorry .
hey !
watch out !
you almost got run over .
why are you sighing ?
it' s gorgeous here .
no need to sigh for that .
i sigh because i' m with you .
pretty place like this is for a man and a woman .
lf only lvy could be here .
fine .
we' il book our return flight tomorrow .
no need .
we still have so many places to go .
there' s no hurry .
besides , i haven' t tried table dance yet .
perhaps adele likes neither churches nor cemeteries .
maybe she likes table dance too !
let' s take a picture , just to prove that we' ve been here .
can you get the geese and the ducks too ?
hurry up .
adele !
take your jacket off !!
i' m doing it !
hurry !!
i' ve never bought any women' s clothes before .
so don' t yell at me if you don' t like them .
you are one hungry ghost !
i haven' t eaten for a long time .
do you remember being hit by a car here ?
yes , but then , it felt like i was asleep , and i even dreamt about you .
do you remember visiting me ?
of course !
you even pointed your gun at me .
you chicken shit .
hey , i was scared .
you' re a ghost !
i' m not a ghost !
drink this .
it' il warm you up .
you know i don' t drink .
why are you testing me ?
but i ...
i just cannot accept the fact that you ...
you' ve been cremated , but now you' re here .
don' t you want to see me ?
of course !
you have a new girlfriend .
no , i don' t !
be honest .
tell me the truth .
i can take it .
just tell me !
no , i really don' t .
you' re still lying ? !
i can see it in your eyes .
do you have a new girl ?
ask him .
you ask him whether i have one .
i don' t want to ask him .
i' m asking you !
you better clear this up .
listen to me .
are you lying ?
i swear !
i swear !
ok ?
that' s it !
she' s definitely your girl .
definitely !
are we really getting married here ?
do you like it ?
as long as you won' t regret it .
of course i won' t !
you two are making me sick .
are you scared ?
you can go on if you are .
i' m getting goose bumps .
call lvy and tell her to come too .
i' ve called her already !
she' s verifying her fingerprints in hong kong right now .
she' s really the boring workaholic type .
not as boring as a nerd like you !
what is it ?
this is too strange .
lf i tell this to anyone , they' re going to say i' m crazy .
doesn' t all this seem like a dream to you ?
doesn' t matter .
the most important thing is that she' s really back .
right ?
hey , come over here .
what' s up ?
this is so pretty !
look !
where ?
i don' t see it .
you asked for it !
you' re going to be broke this time .
lsn' t this beautiful ?
adele !!
wait !
adele !!
calm down !!
are you crazy ??
get back here !
just let me go !
get up !
dr. ken , don' t worry .
adele will be back .
the most important thing is that you know she' s real .
adele ?
where is she ??
so you' re the one behind everything ?
everything is god' s will .
i' m just his messenger .
god ? !
what god ?
besides god , who else can be this powerful ?
i give you this ring .
wear it when you' re back in hong kong .
can' t move ?
i' m afraid you might get too excited .
go to hell !
you don' t excite me !
i' ve always said that foreigners are the craziest of all !
get him !
let me kick his ass !!
why take her away from me and shatter my heart ?
and in a lapse of time , bid farewell to happiness ?
my feeble hands were unable to comfort my broken heart
hard to let go , with only tears in my eyes
how did this happen ?
how can i solve this mystery ?
the burden too heavy , the pain too much
a regret that i cannot face
never thought i was that close when i lost my love ...
take a look at this .
some i can name and some i can' t .
cost me a month' s salary .
this is powerful shit .
you will be safe with this .
besides , i' m with you .
don' t worry .
i' il go by myself tonight .
i didn' t get it .
come again ?
i feel a sense of danger here .
but i really want to see adele again , so ...
so what ?
are you giving up now ?
that billy conners is just another con man !
he' s an authority figure in psychology .
he studies esp .
so ?
he' s a high class con man then !
then how do you explain adele ?
how would i know ?
you' re the scientist and you' re asking me ? !
because even i can' t explain it myself .
don' t be scared .
lf he does anything funny ,
i' il beat the shit out of him .
don' t you worry .
you don' t understand .
you really don' t !
you' ve got lvy .
you' ve never lost your most beloved .
i really want to see adele again .
what does that mean ??
call me when you need me , and kick me out when you don' t need me anymore ? !
who do you think i am ?
a call girl ??
that' s not what i meant !
sorry .
am i interrupting ?
of course not .
we' re just chatting .
boss , do you want to join our party ?
no , i' m not going .
lots of good food there !
you guys have fun tonight .
alright then .
we' re going .
janis .
walk tai pang to the door for me .
tai pang !
merry christmas .
i' il wish you a merry christmas if i still see you tomorrow .
ken .
i said i' m not going .
have fun tonight .
i' m not talking about that party .
welcome to our party .
come on .
he' s here .
hi , clarence .
hello !
ken , welcome .
johnny ? !
surprised ?
there are lots of familiar faces here .
hello , ken !
we knew you' d join us sooner or later .
welcome .
where' s adele ?
she' s fine .
don' t you worry .
let the ceremony begins .
drink this , dr. ken .
i don' t understand .
you still don' t ?
i' ve told you .
i' m here to welcome you .
ls murder part of your welcome too ?
they died to prove god' s power .
so you admit to killing all those people ?
that' s all i need .
pollce !
freeze !
freeze !
you know how excited i am .
chuck , bring him here .
watch out for his tricks .
tai pang , where' s your " stick " ?
one of them must work !
tell me .
where' s adele ?
why ?
why don' t you believe me ?
it is god' s will ... lt is god' s will ...
tell me .
tell me where adele is !
you tell me where she is !
why didn' t you believe him ?
he cured my terminal cancer in just one day .
hey , wait .
thanks .
what ?
are you afraid he' s not dead ?
maybe he' il resurrect .
did you regret it ?
not at all .
he' s a con man and a killer .
but he' s known to perform miracles .
where' s tit sun ?
he wants to sit around longer .
marry me ?
don' t be silly .
you never know what will happen tomorrow .
why ?
why can' t i accept anything beyond science ?
ls it because i' m too smart , or just plain ignorant ?
stop the car !
tell them to go back !
call the ambulance !
what' s that ?
lf you believe me , i will not disappoint you .
i' il have a surprise for you .
your friend is a real pain in the butt .
why do you care so much about life and death ?
tai pang !
get out of here !!
actually , they' re no big deal .
are you nuts ?
are you ??
so you like killing ?
klll me then !
klll me !!!
pain all over !
so that' s how it feels to have a hole in your chest !
sun , it is so clear to me now .
the brothers and sisters in this group are all carefully chosen by him to assist you .
what exactly are you trying to say ?
you won' t understand .
he gives you a quota to select a group of people and accomplish the last mission .
last mission ? !
yeah !
what is it ?
armageddon !
the moon turning red and the earthquakes ...
all the signs have appeared .
there' s only one sign left now .
once a non believer like you starts to have faith , then it' s done !
it' s easy for geniuses like you to create armageddon .
how many do i need to choose ?
1 , 500 .
you' re saying that only 1 , 500 people will survive armageddon ? !
doesn' t matter !
it' s the end of the world !
what' s the difference between life and death ?
you and the remaining 1 , 500 people will turn into gods and recreate a perfect world .
by then , the new world will have no war , no starvation , no disease , not even triads .
everybody just sings karaoke everyday .
lsn' t that wonderful ?
and you , you' il be our leader .
lsn' t it cool ?
i can choose whomever i want ?
of course !
you' re his son , and i' m your buddy .
remember to save me a spot , ok ?
just say the word , and lvy will resurrect , just like adele .
why are you so clear minded all of a sudden ?
how could you understand the whole picture ?
it' s a miracle !
even now , you still don' t believe in him ?
i' m not saying that i don' t believe in him , but ...
it' s the truth !
haven' t you heard of the truth ?
then , is the truth right or wrong ?
you ... you still have to ask this ?
survival of the fittest is the law of nature , and that' s also the truth .
ls that right or wrong ?
you said that , out of millions of people , only 1 , 500 will survive armageddon .
do you think that' s right ?
but they deserve to die !
look what they' ve done to the world !
all that pollution !
even if you don' t create armageddon , the world will end sooner or later !
lf he really wants them to change , why can' t he just come out and say it ?
i guarantee that they will believe him and change ...
so what' s your point ??
you' re not tai pang .
he wouldn' t ask me like that .
he knows i won' t do it .
why can' t you understand ?
this is already predestined .
the world can change for the better .
just like you can change into tai pang , right ?
you' il lose adele .
i was dead already .
we haven' t lost anything .
besides , it' s almost the end of the world .
no point for me to come back .
someone will do this !
even if you don' t , someone else will !
find someone else then .
i don' t want to be another judas .
you will both go to hell !
go to hell ?
it' s already armageddon .
what' s so scary about hell ?
we' il go together .
fool !
you' re such a fool !!
god !
please execute your last judgement !
pain all over !
so that' s how it feels to have a hole in your chest !
damn !
why did you hit me so hard ? !
are you tai pang ?
who else could i be ?
your dad ??
it' s like a nightmare !
good .
now everything is ...
don' t come near .
it' s alright now .
how do you know ?
i' m already dead .
what if i vanish again ?
don' t come any closer !
i' m afraid i' il vanish again .
promise me ...
promise me you won' t miss me anymore ?
adele , i ...
just stay there and listen !
there may not be another chance .
lf i do disappear , promise me you' il live a good life .
i don' t want to see you sad .
you only live once .
i was already dead .
i' ve already earned my extra time by seeing you again .
no , you won' t .
you won' t vanish again .
listen to me ...
that' s what we thought when we were in prague .
just promise that you won' t miss me .
i know i won' t miss you !
i think i' il go to heaven or get reincarnated .
i promise you .
i' il live well .
i' il go out , and i' il date other girls , alright ?
but i won' t let you cook instant noodles for your new girlfriends .
i' m really afraid i' il vanish again !
no , you won' t .
i' il never leave you .
no man is that devoted .
sure there is .
i' m proud to present the most devoted husband , ken tit sun .
you' re bad !
lvy ! lvy !
i' m here !
i thought it was armageddon ?
how come you get to have all the fun ?
i think if we had accepted his mission , then that would' ve been the end of the world .
so it was a test ?
what kind of a naughty god is that ?
he didn' t say .
but i guess they' re all the same .
anyway , just don' t do anything that would hurt other people .
does marrying lvy count as hurting others ?
i better reconsider .
forget it .
you' re going to hell for sure !
yeah right !
lf i can choose , i' il definitely choose armageddon .
fine , fine .
i' ve told you .
everything would be alright .
you' re so brave !
really ?
my mom said that about me all the time !
the health department is stunned that
christmas was the first day in hong kong history where there were no deaths .
they believe it was a miracle that the 4 critically injured survive .
as for the strange lightshow at the hong kong stadium , the government is at a loss for explanation ...
