considering what ?
marvin' s past .
that' s where we first met .
the precinct .
i took your statement the last time marvin witnessed a crime .
oh , right .
i' m surprised you remembered .
that must be three years ago .
you didn' t even talk
easy , marvin .
maybe you need to spend a little less time peeping .
okay , look , we both saw desmond get killed .
rosy !
please .
no , no , no .
she seems certain .
are you ?
and what about you ?
what did you see ?
it looked like something happened .
it looked like something happened ?
are you 1 00 % sure , marvin ?
you saw a murder ?
i don' t know .
it doesn' t sound like trouble to me , but ...
i can check in on you from time to time .
could you do that ...
detective ?
yeah .
sure .
i can put some of my guys on patrol .
keep an eye on the ' hood .
and ... call me gary .

what' s dumars doing now ?
trying to pork mom , accusing me of being a junkie .
i want to smash him .
how' s garbage ?

whatever .
he' s got other things on his mind .
hey , can i look ?

it' s just ...
i don' t know what we saw , but it looked bad .
and garbageman ...
i gotta do something .
you know , my dad' s the building manager .
bad idea .

it would be the easiest thing to get a key to garbageman' s apartment .
terrible , terrible idea .
and marvin could keep watch for us .
here' s my mobile number .
haven' t you guys seen this movie ?
fucking terrible idea .
what do you think ?
the pastures .
hmm ?
adam pasture .
the kid who disappeared last week .
his family would have reported him missing .
we could talk to them .
see what they know .
and it might help get dumars to take us serious ly .
come on , it' s not gonna hurt .
803 .
this should be the pastures .
# why must all the boys act so shy ? #
# l have guessed the reason why #
# l may be as brown as a berry #
# but that' s only secondary #
# and you can' t tell the difference after dark #
# mmm , i may not be so appealing #
# but i' ve got that certain feeling #
# and you can' t tell the difference after dark #
# they say that gentlemen prefer the blond hair #
# ladies , tell me , am i out of style #
# just because l' m slightly shady ? #
# wait until i' ve won you #
# and my love drops down upon you #

i just don' t know what you' re doing .
well ... [ sighs ]
well , your mom ...
she' s a special lady .
and she really digs me .
and i think that what we' ve got could really blossom .
i don' t want to know what you do with my mom , just so long as you never pretend to be my dad .
and stop pretending that you don' t believe me and assigning these guys to the courtyard .
what ?
who' s the official looking guy in the car ?
let me see .
and there' s another one .
and another one .
those aren' t my guys .
i might as well be a beat cop .
i don' t even have " guys .
i' m ...
i' m sorry .
i was trying to impress your mom .
i don' t even have the authority to put men on patrol .
well , then who are they ?
well ... maybe i could find out .
hey , you' re home .

oh , trying not to smoke .
because of marvin ?
that' s so sweet .

where' s the fucking phone ?
marvin ?

9 1 1 emergency .
the judas breed .
i' ve seen two of them .
could you repeat that , sir ?
two people are dead .
a cop is dead .
my sister' s been ... killed .
come on .
go .
give me the goddamn phone .
the judas egg .
smart boy .
that' s a king egg .
that' s a fertile male .
yeah .
i have an emergency .
forward this to the cdc , a. d. kirschner .
lmmediately .
authorization 1 9 7 66 7 .
we' ve got two specimens .
they' re soldier caste .
probably more .
what' s the matter ?
i' m allergic to roaches .
right .
then you' il be my coal miner' s canary .
put that in the fridge .
nobody does anything stupid , and nobody has to die early .
we have to destroy it .
now , that qualifies as stupid .
a fertile male could establish a new colony .
a new outbreak .
deck chairs on the " titanic .
that egg is one of thousands .
they' re hoarding them .
waiting .
we have to destroy it .
we have to try to
hey , i will kill you .
so help me god , i' il kill you .
here .
that egg equals my getaway money .
as far from civilization as i can get .
we' ve already lost .
it' s over .
empty that around the door .
it' s kerosene .
they don' t like fire .
that doesn' t make any sense .
they don' t have intelligence .
strategize , reason .
they adapt .
that' s how we made them .
they don' t have to be any bigger or stronger , so they got smarter .
this is not a city anymore .
it' s a goddamn killing jar .
the door !
mom .
yeah ?
why aren' t you in your room ?
run !
close the goddamn door !
oh , my god .
aah !
don' t shoot .
it' s us .
marvin ...
ls carmen alive ?
he' s trying to talk .
