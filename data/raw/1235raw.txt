there' s not much to tell really .
i was on my way home from work and i don' t remember anything else .
first dead body i' ve ever seen .
look different in real life .
they don' t move .
from the looks of these chains ... someone didn' t want us to go very far either .
can you see any scars ?
what ?
this is what they do .
they kidnap you and drug you ... and before you know it , you' re in a bathtub and your kidneys are on ebay .
no one has taken your kidneys .
how can you tell from way over there ?
because you' d either be in terrible agony or you' d be dead by now .
trust me .
what are you , a surgeon ?
yeah .
so , you going to tell me your name or what ?
adam .
well , adam ... what we need to do ... is start thinking about why we are here .
whoever brought us here could' ve killed us by now .
but they didn' t .
they must want something from us .
question is what .
that clock .
what about it ?
it' s brand new .
so ?
so somebody obviously wanted us to know the time .
wait .
i think i might be able to reach the door .
what is that ?
excuse me .
it' s a tape .
where did you find it ?
it was in my pocket .
it says " play me .
come on .
throw it over here .
no ?
use your shirt .
what ?
your shirt .
come on .
it won' t work .
look around .
there must be something else you can use .
there' s nothing .
there must be something .
come on .
you can do it .
come on .
again .
<i>rise and shine , adam . </ i>
<i>you' re probably wondering where you are . </ i>
<i>i' il tell you where you might be . </ i>
<i>you might be in the room that you die in . </ i>
<i>up until now, </ i> <i>you simply sat in the shadows ... </ i> <i>watching others live out their lives . </ i>
<i>what do voyeurs see</ i> <i>when they look into the mirror ? </ i>
<i>now , i see you as a strange mix ... </ i> <i>of someone angry and yet apathetic . </ i>
<i>but mostly just pathetic . </ i>
<i>so are you going to watch yourself</ i> <i>die today , adam ? </ i>
<i>or do something about it ? </ i>
i don' t get it .
throw me the player .
no .
you throw me your tape .
look , we' re going to have to work together if we want to get out of here .
now , just throw it to me .
i' m not going to risk breaking it .
you throw me your tape .
<i>dr .
gordon .
this is your wake up call . </ i>
<i>every day of your working life, </ i> <i>you have given people the news ... </ i> <i>that they are going to die soon . </ i>
<i>now you will be the cause of death . </ i>
<i>your aim in this game is to kill adam . </ i>
<i>you have until 6 : 00 on the clock to do it . </ i>
<i>there' s a man in the room with you . </ i>
<i>when there is that much poison</ i> <i>in your blood , the only thing left to do ... </ i> <i>is shoot yourself . </ i>
<i>there are ways to win this ... </ i> <i>hidden all around you . </ i>
<i>just remember : </ i>
<i>" x " marks the spot for the treasure . </ i>
<i>if you do not kill adam by 6 : 00 ... </ i> <i>then alison and diana will die , dr. gordon . </ i>
<i>and i' il leave you in this room to rot . </ i>
<i>let the game begin . </ i>
give me that .
now .
<i> ... then alison and diana will die, </ i> <i>dr .
gordon . </ i>
<i>and i will leave you in this room to rot . </ i>
any idea who that is ?
<i>let the game begin . </ i>
he knows us .
come on .
what do you think ?
probably a joke , right ?
<i>let the game begin . </ i>
listen .
<i>follow your heart . </ i>
what the hell does " follow your heart " mean ?
there , right next to you , on the toilet .
come on .
anything ?
no solids .
take off the lid .
i really wish i had checked in there first .
what is it ?
mind passing me the other one ?
fuck !
he doesn' t want us to cut through our chains .
he wants us to cut through our feet .
i think i may know who' s done this to us .
what did you say ?
it' s not someone i know personally .
it' s just someone i know of .
jesus christ !
tell me .
who is it ?
the last i heard ... the police still hadn' t caught him .
<i>and the only reason i know that</ i> <i>is because i was a suspect . </ i>
<i>i' il start from the beginning . </ i>
this one' s not fresh anymore .
at least three weeks out .
victim' s a 46 year old male .
died of massive blood loss .
mostly through the femoral artery .
he started at the back of the cage ... and tunneled his way through that razor wire so fast ... it' s amazing he got as far as he did .
cut himself so deep , we found traces of stomach acid on the floor .
we also found this .
<i>hello , paul . </ i>
<i>you' re a perfectly healthy , sane, </ i> <i>middle class male . </ i>
<i>yet , last month , you ran a straight razor</ i> <i>across your wrists . </ i>
<i>did you hurt yourself</ i> <i>because you truly wanted to die ... </ i> <i>or did you just want some attention ? </ i>
<i>tonight , you' il show me . </ i>
<i>the irony is that if you want to die</ i> <i>you just have to stay where you are . </ i>
<i>but if you want to live, </ i> <i>you' il have to cut yourself again . </ i>
<i>one path through the razor wire to the door . </ i>
<i>but hurry .
at 3 : 00 that door will lock ... </ i> <i>and then this room becomes your tomb . </ i>
<i>how much blood will you shed</ i> <i>to stay alive , paul ? </ i>
the door was on a timer .
it was unlocked until 3 : 00 .
then it snapped shut .
he was given two hours .
jigsaw piece .
i think i' m gonna be here for a while .
the newspapers started calling him the " jigsaw killer .
actually , technically speaking , he is ... not really a murderer .
he never killed anyone .
<i>he finds ways for his victims</ i> <i>to kill themselves . </ i>
<i>hello , mark , if you' re so sick ... </ i> <i>then why do i have</ i> <i>so many photos of you up and about ? </ i>
<i>let' s put your so called illness to the test . </ i>
<i>right now, </ i> <i>there is a slow acting poison in your veins . </ i>
<i>the antidote is inside the safe . </ i>
<i>the combination to the safe ... </ i> <i>is written on the wall . </ i>
<i>hurry up and program it in . </ i>
<i>but watch your step . </ i>
<i>by the way , that' s flammable substance</ i> <i>smeared on your body . </ i>
<i>so i would be careful with that candle, </ i> <i>if i were you ... </ i>
help . <i> ... or all the people</ i> <i>you' ve burned with your act ... </ i> <i>just might have their revenge . </ i>
i found something else .
well , two things actually .
there was someone standing outside here watching through this peephole .
looks like our friend jigsaw likes to book himself front row seats to his sick games .
he was there at the last one as well .
only this time , he left us his penlight .
get a rush on the prints .
copy that .
okay .
this patient has an inoperable frontal lobe tumor ... extending across the midline .
started as a colon cancer .
the patient has come in for a standard checkup ... by which we are able to monitor the rate at which his condition is declining .
the patient had ...
his name is john , dr. gordon .
he' s a very interesting person .
thank you for that information , zep .
as you can see , our orderlies form very special bonds with the patients .
continuing on , the patient ...
<i>dr .
gordon , please page the operator . </ i>
obviously , someone doesn' t want me to tell you what the patient has .
excuse me .
dr. gordon , i' m det .
tapp ... this is det .
sing .
city homicide .
very impressive .
thank you .
i do my best .
sorry to interrupt you while you' re working .
that' s fine .
how can i help you , gentlemen ?
tell us where you were ... between the hours of 11 : 00 p . m .
and 1 : 00 a . m .
last night , doctor .
why is it that you' re interested ?
we' d like to ask you a few questions about it .
for your sake , i think it' s best if we do it down at the station .
would you like to follow us there ?
no .
i' m afraid that' s quite out of the question .
i can' t just leave , i have work to do .
plus , my wife has the car today .
that' s okay .
you can ride with us , doc .
i' m sorry , you' il have to tell me again .
what is this all about ?
is this yours , doctor ?
so you have no idea how your penlight showed up at the murder scene ?
of course not .
i' il have to ask .
what were you doing last night ?
i was seeing someone .
who ?
look , if you can' t be honest with me ...
i was visiting someone .
it wasn' t a patient .
what am i gonna do ?
well , as your lawyer and your friend , my advice to you is to bite the bullet ... and give them your alibi now .
because no one is going to believe you later .
that was five months ago .
he tried to set me up for murder .
okay .
we checked your alibi .
it holds up .
good .
can i go home now ?
we have one of the victims who managed to escape .
want to know if you wouldn' t mind sticking around and listening to her testimony ?
maybe it' il trigger something .
i' d like to help really but ...
we' d really appreciate it .
she' s the only one who made it .
okay .
amanda ... in your own time ... tell me the first thing you remember .
<i>i woke up .
all i could taste was blood ... </ i> <i>and metal . </ i>
<i>hello , amanda . </ i>
<i>you don' t know me , but i know you . </ i>
<i>i want to play a game . </ i>
<i>here' s what happens if you lose . </ i>
<i>the device you' re wearing</ i> <i>is hooked into your upper and lower jaws . </ i>
<i>when the timer at the back goes off ... </ i> <i>your mouth will be</ i> <i>permanently ripped open . </ i>
<i>think of it like a reverse bear trap . </ i>
<i>here , i' il show you . </ i>
<i>there is only one key to open the device . </ i>
<i>it' s in the stomach of your dead cellmate . </ i>
<i>look around , amanda . </ i>
<i>know that i' m not lying . </ i>
<i>you better hurry up . </ i>
<i>live or die .
make your choice . </ i>
and then i saw the body .
there was a knife .
he' d been injected with an opiate overdose .
he couldn' t move or feel much of anything .
you mean he was alive ?
was .
what happened after you took it off ?
<i>congratulations .
you are still alive . </ i>
<i>most people are so ungrateful to be alive . </ i>
<i>but not you .
not anymore . </ i>
you are , in fact , a drug addict .
isn' t that right , mandy ?
do you think that is why he picked you ?
are you grateful , mandy ?
he helped me .
are you sure it' s him ?
yeah , i' m sure .
how do i know you' re telling the truth ?
you can be the one that put me in this room .
i' m in exactly the same situation you are in .
wrong .
information .
you know who did this .
now you either tell me what is really going on ... or i' il cut you with this .
you hear me ?
i' il cut ...
what ?
it' s a two way mirror .
i can see you .
<i>so that' s what this is .
reality tv . </ i>
don' t look at me .
i can' t help you .
can you hear me in there ?
i' m having a blast .
this is the most fun i' ve had without lubricant .
make sure you' re getting everything .
that' s not going to do anything .
<i>you just want to leave it running on us ? </ i>
<i>he won' t stop it . </ i>
that' s why we can' t cut through these chains .
it' s why you won' t break that glass .
every possible angle has been pre thought out by him .
you sound like you admire this prick .
to overcome something , you have to understand what a perfect engine it is .
that' s how you fight disease .
now the tape told us to find an " x.
that " x " has to be somewhere in this room .
help me find it .
how can you be the calm doctor guy when your wife and kid are out there ?
he' s got them , too .
he could be doing anything to them right now .
are you thinking about that ?
i am thinking about that .
i' ve been thinking about the last thing i said to my daughter .
diana .
honey , are you okay ?
can you hear me ?
mommy .
what is it , sweetpea ?
there' s a man in my room .
honey , are you sure he' s not just hiding in your imagination ?
he talked to me .
okay , i' il come and check your room .
i want daddy .
he' il get the scary man .
all right , if you want .
come on .
larry , sorry to bother you , but your daughter had a bad dream again .
just a minute .
she wants you to check her room .
just got to finish this paragraph .
come on , sweetie , i' il go check with you .
yep .
i' m done .
see , there' s no one in your room .
there' s no such thing as the bad man .
now can you go to sleep ?
i' m still scared .
you are ?
give me your tootsy .
what a big tootsy .
remember this one ?
this little piggy went to market this little piggy stayed home
this little piggy had roast beef this little piggy had none
this little piggy went ' whee ' all the way home
i hate that thing .
i have to go to work , sweetheart .
you know what daddy' s job is like .
now , come on .
let' s see .
try and get some sleep now , okay ?
you' re not going to leave us , are you , daddy ?
what ?
what are you talking about ?
you mean , leave you and mommy ?
no , sweetheart .
i would never do that .
who gave you that idea ?
no one .
it' s not true .
okay ?
how much do i love you ?
love you very much .
very much .
that' s right .
good night , sweetie .
good night , daddy .
tomorrow , i' il read your favorite story .
okay .
i don' t know how much longer i can do this .
what are you talking about ?
how can you walk through life pretending you' re happy ?
i am happy .
that is complete bullshit .
i' d rather you break down and tell me that you hated me .
at least there' d be some passion in it .
would you like to see her ?
she' s beautiful .
thank you .
you gonna have any more kids ?
we' ve talked about it , but ... with our schedules , it' s difficult enough to concentrate on one .
so where is the lucky wife ?
there' s another picture behind the one you' re looking at .
it' s my favorite one because we' re all in it together .
someone , usually me , has to hold the camera ... which means i' m always missing from the photos .
it' s not here .
what ?
this photo you' re talking about is not here .
really ?
are you sure ?
yeah .
he must have taken it .
how can you walk through life pretending you' re happy ?
i am happy .
that is complete bullshit .
i' d rather you break down and tell me that you hated me .
at least there' d be some passion in it .
we can talk about this later , okay ?
just leave .
<i>good night , little girl . </ i>
diana !
mommy !
mommy !
don' t do that !
leave her !
<i>you little man ... </ i>
<i>i see you . </ i>
<i>does dr. gordon know</ i> <i>you' re at home with his wife ? </ i>
<i>i know you know something . </ i>
<i>what are you doing there ? </ i>
<i>waiting for the doctor ? </ i>
<i>i' m waiting for the doctor , too . </ i>
<i>i know that she' il let you go . </ i>
<i>so you have no idea how your penlight</ i> <i>showed up at the murder scene ? </ i>
we checked your alibi .
it holds up .
isn' t that right ?
<i>i know that she' il let you go . </ i>
here we are .
that was quite an amazing story that poor woman told .
i' m sorry i can' t be of more help to your investigation .
you know , we arrested a dentist last week ... who liked to play with kids a bit too much .
he lived two blocks from here .
the sewer lines run under this neighborhood , too , doctor .
<i>hello , amanda . </ i>
<i>you don' t know me , but i know you . </ i>
<i>i want to play a game . </ i>
<i>here' s what happens if you lose . </ i>
<i>there' s a timer</ i> <i>at the back of the device you' re wearing . </ i>
<i>when the timer goes off ... </ i> <i>your mouth will be</ i> <i>permanently ripped open . </ i>
i' il catch you guys down there .
<i>think of it like a reverse bear trap . </ i>
<i>i' il show you . </ i>
we' re gonna go down to the grill , go get a beer .
you wanna come ?
i don' t think so .
thanks , anyway .
you know i always ask .
<i>there' s only one key ... </ i>
i' il leave you to have fun here then .
<i>it' s in the stomach of your dead cellmate . </ i>
i don' t mean for this to be disrespectful .
maybe you should find yourself a girlfriend .
<i>it' s in the stomach of your dead cellmate . </ i>
<i>look around . </ i>
<i>look around , amanda . </ i>
<i>know that i' m not lying . </ i>
<i>you better hurry up . </ i>
wait !
sing .
get back here .

k2k .
that gang' s territory was only about four blocks .
listen to this .
we gotta check the records ... from all fire emergencies that occurred there in the last two weeks .
go .
right now .
on the night of tuesday , the 17th ... we got a fire alarm going off in the rear wing of 213 , stygian street .
it' s an old listing .
used to be a mannequin factory .
think we have enough for a warrant now ?
who said anything about a warrant ?
right now ?
why not ?
at least we' il have the cover of darkness .
yeah , well , so will anybody else .
i got you .
what the hell is this ?
shit !
sing .
what ?
let' s see what' s he' s gonna do .
why ?

we don' t know what he looks like .
lets see what he' s gonna do .
no fucking way .
fuck that .
i' m gonna take him .
what the fuck ?
shit !
awake already , jeff ?
i need more powerful tranquilizers next time .
don' t cry .
i' ve given your life a purpose .
you' re a test subject for something greater than yourself .
freeze !
police .
hold it right there !
don' t move !
put your fucking hands in the air !
now you' il make a choice .
in 20 seconds , the life of this man will be ended .
shut up and get down here .
turn it off .
sing , stop that thing .
i' m taking this bastard down .
move !
how do you turn it off ?
tell him how to stop it !
one key will unlock it .
where is it ?
it' s in the box .
box ?
which key ?
tell him which key it is .
time is running out .
get down here right now , asshole !
what' s more important to you , officer ... arresting me , or the life of another human being ?
get down on your knees !
jesus !
help me !
yes , i am sick , officer .
tapp , it' s none of the keys here !
sick from the disease eating away at me inside .
sick of people who don' t appreciate their blessings .
sick of those who scoff at the suffering of others .
i' m sick of all .
no !
tapp .
shit .
i' il be back .
okay ?
freeze !
or i' il shoot .
got you on your knees .
you' re running .
you' re running scared because we had you .
i' m going to close this case .
we' ve closed it .
we' re right , sing .
we' re going to close this thing .
<i>" x " marks the spot . </ i>
<i>we should search this room again . </ i>
<i>what are you doing over there ? </ i>
excuse me .
just because i' m stuck in this room with you ... doesn' t mean i have to report to you every 10 seconds .
i really don' t see the point in us not helping one other .
what do you want me to do ?
i' m on a leash .
that' s exactly why we need to talk .
we need to think .
i am thinking .
then don' t keep me in the dark about what you' re thinking .
turn off the lights .
what ?
turn them off , now , please !
why ?
just turn them off for a second .
jesus !
behind you .
how come we didn' t see that before ?
the lights in here hadn' t charged it .
it must be glow in the dark paint or something .
open it .
it' s locked .
the key .
the one from my envelope .
where is it ?
where the fuck ...
here .
cell phone .
the most beautiful invention on this planet .
make that second most beautiful invention .
<i>give me that . </ i>
<i>are you joking ? </ i>
<i>you' re gonna put something we found</ i> <i>in this room in your mouth ? </ i>
yes .
i' m willing to risk it .
give me that sweet cancer .
i don' t care , i really don' t .
give me one of those .
<i>the cigarettes are harmless , i promise . </ i>
<i>smoking is only poisonous</ i> <i>when it ends in bloodshed . </ i>
<i>think about this : </ i>
<i>you don' t need a gun to kill adam . </ i>
may i please have a cigarette ?
i' m trying the police .
shit .
this was meant to receive calls , not make them .
wait a minute .
this has happened before .
<i>last night , after i finished at the hospital ... </ i>
<i>i was walking back to my car . </ i>
<i>i thought i was alone, </ i> <i>but i' m sure someone else was there . </ i>
that thing .
it was waiting for me .
how did you know to turn off the lights ?
who cares ?
it worked .
yeah , but how did you know ?
instinct .
instinct ?
yeah .
you know what ?
you' re a terrible liar .
you say that like you know me .
what else aren' t you telling me ?
let' s see .
on my sixth birthday , my best friend at that time , scott tibbs ... stabbed me with a rusty nail .
i didn' t tell you that .
i didn' t tell you my last girlfriend , a feminist vegan punk ... broke up with me because she thought i was too angry .
i haven' t told you that one of my toenails ...
stop it .
you knew to turn off these lights .
whatever .
i' m dealing with a juvenile .
you wanna know ?
yeah .
here it is .
oh , god !
where did you get this ?
it was in your wallet , behind the photo of your daughter .
why didn' t you show me this before ?
i couldn' t .
i' m sorry .
what are you doing to them , you bastard ?
okay , i got to think now .
<i>think about this : </ i>
<i>you don' t need a gun to kill adam . </ i>
<i>when there is that much poison</ i> <i>in your blood , the only thing left to do ... </ i> <i>is shoot yourself . </ i>
what are you doing ?
<i>hey ! </ i>
what the hell are you doing ?
adam , listen to me .
i want you to play along with me on this .
you got that ?
so , you still want that cigarette ?
yeah .
sure .
there , i' ve done it !
i' ve killed him with the poison , just like you wanted !
now where is my family ?
where are they ?
what ?
i just got electrocuted .
what ?
that was our way out .
did you hear what i said ?
get this thing off me .
get it off !
stop acting .
you think i would make that up ... just to mess up your stupid , fucking charade ?
all right , that' s it !
damn it !
i remember everything now .
i remember how i got here .
great !
is someone there ?
i can hear you .
what the ...
what the ...
who is that ?
who' s in there ?
come on out !
i' il kill you , you motherfucker .
who is this ?
<i>daddy ? </ i>
diana ?
daddy , is that you ?
yeah , baby , it' s me .
i' m here .
i' m scared , daddy .
don' t worry , honey .
everything' s going to be okay .
<i>where is mommy ? </ i>
she' s here with me .
let me talk to her , sweetie .
okay ?
put mommy on .
the bad man from my room is here .
<i>he has us tied up ... </ i> and he has a gun .
what man ?
<i>please come home , daddy . </ i>
hello ?
diana ?
larry ?
ali ?
is adam there ?
how do you know ?
ali , what is going on ?
don' t believe adam' s lies .
<i>he knows you . </ i>
<i>he knew all about you before today . </ i>
hello ?
ali ?
hello ?
god damn you !
if you so much as lay a finger on them , i' il kill you !
do you hear me ?
you son of a bitch .
i' il kill you !
are they okay ?
my wife , she mentioned your name .
what did she say ?
she told me ... not to believe you .
believe me about what ?
she told me you know me .
who are you ?
you know who i am .
stop the lies .
you' re a liar !
i need to know the truth !
i' m a liar ?
what did you do last night , lawrence ?
work at a hospital ?
saving sick children ?
you told me that after you left your house last night , you went to work at a hospital .
that' s because it' s the truth .
no , it' s not .
your wife is right , larry .
you don' t recall getting your picture taken in that parking lot ?
i can prove that you didn' t go anywhere near a hospital last night .
it' s not the first time i' ve done it either , larry .
i' ve been taking pictures of you for a few days now .
why ?
wanna know what i do ?
i get paid to take pictures of rich guys like you ... who go to seedy , out of the way motels to fuck their secretaries .
last night i went to your house .
i watched you leave .
<i>i followed you ... </ i> <i>all the way to that shitbag hotel . </ i>
you' ve had these with you the whole time ?
i found them in there , with the hacksaws .
<i>i don' t know how they got there . </ i>
yeah , right .
you' re so full of it !
face it , larry , we' re both bullshitters , but my camera isn' t .
it doesn' t know how to lie .
it shows you what' s put right in front of it .
just out of curiosity , what did you do in that motel room ?
you got out of there pretty fast .
why did you deem it necessary to page me when you knew i was at home ?
i didn' t know if you were gonna make it .
but i gave you a precise time at which to page me .
you can' t do that .
it' s not like i know the rules for this sort of stuff .
what' s wrong , dr. gordon ?
look , it was wrong of me to make you come here .
but i thought we ...
please .
i' m sorry .

no .
hello ?
it' s for you .
for me ?
hello ?
<i>i know what you' re doing , doctor . </ i>
i have to go .
what happened ?
i got to go .
who was it ?
who was what ?
the person who paid you to follow me ?
who was it ?
he calls himself bob and he gives me the money up front . $200 a night .
if i knew i was gonna end up here , i would' ve asked for more .
does that mean you saw what happened to me ?
what i saw was you get into your car .
that' s it .
i didn' t ask your name .
i didn' t know who you were .
i don' t know how i got here , i don' t know how you got here .
<i>i just took the shots</ i> <i>and went straight home to develop . </ i>
next thing i know , i' m chained to a pipe ... in some pre historic bathroom ... staring at the guy i' ve been taking shots of all night .
clearly , whoever paid you to take pictures of me is the one who put us here .
maybe .
what do you mean maybe ?
of course it is .
what did he look like ?
he was just a guy .
was he tall , skinny , obese , what ?
i don' t take notes about his appearance .
you must remember something of him .
i can' t .
you don' t remember a thing about the guy ?
i told you ...
for fuck' s sake !
i give up !
he' s a tall , black guy .
he' s got a scar around his neck , okay ?
tapp !
det .
tapp .
the guy who paid me to take these photos was not a cop .
no .
he was discharged from the police force .
he broke down after his partner was killed .
but that didn' t stop him from harassing me .
the guy became obsessed .
he convinced himself i must have somehow been involved with the murders ...
and you helped him .
you took money from him to invade my privacy .
how could you do that ?
call it my need to eat .
right .
you know what ?
you' re not a victim of this game ...
you' re a part of it .
really ?
obviously this cop thinks you' re the one behind it all .
i told you , he' s not a cop .
he' s a bottom feeder .
just like you .
what are you more pissed off about ?
that i took some shots of you ... or that i took shots while you were cheating on your wife ?
i did not cheat on her !
why do you care what i think anyway ?
i don' t give a crap if you covered yourself in peanut butter ... and had a 15 hooker gang bang .
how did i get here ?
i had everything in order .
my whole life was in perfect order .
sweetheart , are you okay ?
mommy just needs you to be really strong right now .
i' m not going to let anybody hurt you .
you got that ?
that' s my good girl .
<i>hey , was there someone else</ i> <i>at your house last night ... </ i>
<i>besides your wife and daughter ? </ i>
<i>no . </ i>
<i>well , there' s someone here . </ i>

<i>i want you to make a choice . </ i>
<i>there' s a slow acting poison</ i> <i>coursing through your system ... </ i> <i>that only i have the antidote for . </ i>

dr. gordon' s time is up .
mrs. gordon ?
<i>listen carefully , if you will .

it' s the rules .
key to that chain is in the bathtub .
he' s a very interesting person .
his name' s john .
he has an inoperable frontal lobe tumor ...
sick from the disease eating away at me inside .
sounds like our friend jigsaw .
<i>sick of people</ i> <i>who don' t appreciate their blessings . </ i>
looks like our guy likes to book himself front row seats to his sick games .
<i>hello , mark . </ i>
<i>dr .
gordon , i want to play a game . </ i>
<i>most people are so ungrateful to be alive . </ i>
<i>but not you .
