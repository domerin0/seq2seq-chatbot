vanity is a sin .

your father and i think the best thing for the child is to give him up for adoption .
a child born outside of wedlock is a bastard .

you committed a horrible sin .
i know , father .
i am repentant .
do you want your child to pay for your sins ?
no , father .
speak more loudly , rose .
no , father .
so you do want to give him a chance in life , and have him raised in a catholic family with a mother and father .
sign here .

you' re taking him away now ?
you might become attached to him .
did you see the baby , dad ?

please , dad , stop them !
don' t let them take my baby away !
please !
please , dad !
put them here on the floor and wait .
sister bridget can receive you .
come in .
thanks to the power of prayer , of cleanliness , of hard work ,
iost women can find the road towards jesus christ .
mary magdalene , holy patron of the magdalene asylums , was a sinner of the worst kind .
for money , she gave her body to the depraved and lustful .
she was saved by doing pennance for her sins , giving up the pleasures of the flesh , including food and sleep .
she worked beyond the resistance of a human being so that she could offer her soul to god , cross the gates of paradise , and live an eternal life .
our laundries do not just clean ordinary clothes and sheets .
they are the earthly means that serve to cleanse your souls and cancel the spots of sin that you committed .
here you can be redeemed in pleasing god .
you can be saved from eternal damnation .

maguire .
and you ?
rose dunne .
we already have a rose .
what is your second name ?

thank you , sister thank you , sister .
and you ?
bernadette haffie .
from saint attractas .

because principal mclaughlin is my good friend and told me about you , or after many years in this convent , i can spot a tempter ?
i don' t know , sister .
poor us !
two simpletons in just one day !
anyway , time will tell us , right ?
now come with me .
good evening , sister .
good evening .
you , come with me .
you , go over there .
you , come here .
in the name of the father , the son and the holy spirit .
angel of god , my guardian dear , to whom god' s love brought me here , ever this day be at my side , to light , to rule and guide .
in the name of the father , the son and the holy spirit .
get right to bed , girls .
excuse me .
can you take me to the bathroom , please ?
yes .
are you alright ?
here .
i feel awful .
what' s the matter ?
i feel ...
i feel faint .
don' t touch her .
is your milk clogged ?
i don' t know .
i think so .
don' t touch her .
you' il drip everywhere .
the sisters get furious when you drip .
keep the pain .
it' il go away in a few days .
you should go to bed .
if they see you become friends , they' il skin you alive .
everyone get out of bed !
everyone up !
have any of you seen una o' conner ?
did any of you hear anything during the night ?
none of you saw her leave ?
breakfast !
i believe in one god ,
father almighty , creator of heaven and earth , and of all things visible , and invisible .
i believe in jesus christ , his only son , born of the father before all ages .
god of god , light of light , true god of true god , begotten , and not made .
i' m sure she was there last night .
i checked .
i checked too !
don' t think i slept last night !
i don' t know how it happened .
i can' t explain it .
you were obviously distracted .
anyway , it is your fault .
it' s the first time ...
i didn' t ...
enough !
i believe in one holy , catholic and apostolic church .
i keep them all well under control , sister .
did you know i' ve been working here for 40 years ?
i won' t wash priests ' collars .
ask someone else .
i don' t do that .
so i have to do my work and yours too ?
if you want , we can exchange .
forget it .
do you have something bloody ?
some girls hate bloody things .
i don' t really care .
there .
i' il do that for you .
some put them in hot water .
i told them , but they won' t listen .
first you must put them in cold water with a little salt .
after that , rub them .
i see .
what are you talking about ?
it' s forbidden to talk here !
sister , they were talking .
i' m giving them a good scolding !
am i right , sister ?
yes , katy .
it is not allowed to talk here .
what were you talking about ?
i told her how to wash this .
jesus , joseph and mary !
get that away from me .
you are disgusting .
did you know that ?
get back to work .
i' ve been working here for 40 years .
i know all the tricks .
i' m keeping you two under control !
poor sister augusta is in trouble because that girl ran away .
that' s why they told me to substitute her here .
that poor sister is destroyed .
her nerves are shattered .
am i right in giving them a piece of mind , sister ?
a good scolding !
the bad thing about you , is that you are all selfish !
you don' t care if a sister gets into trouble and loses her position .
she just fell asleep while she was on surveillance , and now she' il end up in africa .
she' il go work with the lepers .
her fingers will fall from her hands and her feet .
she could lose her nose !
anything that sticks out from her body could fall off .
now get to work .
work in silence .
come on !
we have to get out of here .
silence !
no !
walk !
i' il make you walk !
walk !
please , don' t !
i' m sorry !
please !
leave me !
is this your place ?
please , father !
please !
is this your place ?
you' il stay here until you live , slut !
i just wanted to go home , dad ...
go back to my house !
i hate this place !
i thought i told you ...
what did i tell you ?
what did i tell you ?
you don' t have a home , a mother or a father .
you killed us , slut .
you killed both of us .
if you run away again , i swear i' il make you a cripple .
mr. o' conner , i think you should leave .
we' il take care of una .
what are you looking at , sluts ?
god bless you , sister .
please don' t leave me here , dad !
don' t leave me here !
get to bed , una .
i' il see you tomorrow morning .
and now , everyone under the covers .
you must sleep .
are all the women who work here , sluts ?
don' t look at them or talk to them , understand ?
good morning .
someone wants you .
my sister !
my little one !
my little boy !
he' s so lovely !
isn' t he the loveliest child on this earth ?
he' s only 2 years old and look how big he is !
blessed virgin , i pray to you and st. christopher .
st. christopher , take care ...
god in heaven , protect him .
blessed are you and blessed are all .
you two , stop wasting time !
are you spastic ?
no .
i was just making a pleasant expression .
you can stick it up your ass .
wow .
they told me you liked boys .
isn' t that so ?
aren' t you here because you like giving it to young men ?
you like pulling your panties down , right ?
what is your little boy' s name ?
i don' t know .
ask me what my name is .
what is your name ?
crispina .
it means " girl with curly hair " .
that' s what sister bridget called me .
two shillings if you suck my cock .
you are crazy , ugly slut !
when my baby came out of my stomach , they gave him to my sister .
she doesn' t have permission to come here , or talk to me .
that' s why i don' t know his name .
but my aunt , who is the richest woman in the world , gave me and him one of these .
my sister ...
my sister brings him to the gate every once in a while , and we talk with this .
this is ...
it' s ...
it' s saint ...
a saint ...
excuse me , sister .
what is the word ?
what is the word ?
i can' t find the word .
you know you' re not supposed to talk .
get back to work .
i said get back to work .
i don' t want to repeat it .
telephone !
that' s it , telephone .
i never remember the word .
i want to see sister bridget immediately !
wait here .
i heard you were disobedient .
i' m sorry , sister .
i just asked to see you .
you didn' t ask , girl .
you demanded .
who gave you the right to demand something ?
i was wondering why i am here , sister .
i did not commit any crime .
i' ve never been to bed with a boy , and that' s the truth .
but you' d like it , wouldn' t you ?
i am a good girl .
no .
you are arrogant , impolite and stupid .
that' s why the boys liked you .
scarce intelligence makes it easy to slip fingers under your clothes .
right , crispina ?
yes , sister .
what did i say ?
i don' t know , sister .
that all men are sinners and therefore , prone to temptation . and therefore , all men are prone to temptation .
in god fearing countries , if men want to be saved from themselves , temptation must be removed .
understand , girl ?
yes , sister .
i didn' t ask you .
i understand , sister .
are you really sure ?
you used too many words .
one syilable was enough .
i understand , sister .
disobedience cannot be tolerated .
faces to the wall .
now go back to your work immediately .
una , have you become mad ?
you don' t need that hair anymore .
we' il sell it to o' brien and give the money to african children .
alright ?
you won' t run away with a shaved head , will you ?
where could you go ?
i have a cousin in dublin who is a hairdresser .
i just saw her once , but i' m sure if i ask her , she will help me .
do you want to come with me ?
why ?
what wrong did we do to deserve this ?
we are not slaves .
we are not handicapped .
what did we do ?
having a child is not a crime .
having a child before marriage is a mortal sin .
all mortal sins of the world do not justify this place .
i' d commit any sin to get out of this place .
let' s get married .
what ?
we can run away together .
where will we go ?
to england , america , wherever you want .
do you have any money ?
you think i have money ?
didn' t you save anything from your pay ?
you think i came here in answer to an ad in the paper ?
i thought you had something .
they don' t give us anything .
well ?
well what ?
let' s run away .
how ?
we don' t have money , or a place to go .
besides , i practically don' t know you .
you can look , but if you touch me , i' il kick your teeth in .
it' s not a fireplace .
do you have the back door keys ?
i don' t .
seamus does .
can you get them ?
i think so .
then get them and bring them tonight .
tonight ?
yes .
holy god !
oh holy god !
christ !
god in heaven !
promise you will come tonight .
okay , i promise .
if you don' t , they' il kill me .
i promise .
go away !
i don' t want to see you !
you are disgusting !
really disgusting !
we' re getting married .
i swear !
he' il never marry you .
he will , but if you tell them , i won' t be able to leave , and we can' t get married .
i will be a sinner .
you don' t want that , do you ?
no .
i' il tell sister bridget you acted disgustingly .
they' il keep you here forever , and you can go to heaven , because you will have paid for your disgusting sins .
please , don' t tell her .
isn' t that good ?
i' il stay here and work and pray for my sins .
please , don' t tell her .
i have to tell her .
alright , but if you do , i will kill myself .
do you know what that means ?
it means i will go to hell and so will you , because in the eyes of god you will be guilty of murder as much as me .
no , that' s not so .
it' s not true .
it' s crazy .
a bunch of bullshit .
open the door .
open the door .
brendan !
it' s me .
please , open the door .
it' s madness .
i don' t even know your name !
it' s crazy !
my name is bernadette !
please , open the door !
they will know i did it .
do you realize that ?
i' il lose my job , everything !
my brother' s serving 6 years in jail for stealing apples from the nuns .
what would my sentence be ?
i' m sorry , i can' t .
brendan !
don' t leave me here !
brendan !
i' m sorry .
at least open this damned door !
stop !
hold her !
i' m holding her !
stop it !
i' m holding her !
that' s enough .
stop !
open your eyes , girl .
open them .
i want you to see what you really are .
now that vanity has gone and your arrogance has been defeated , you are free to choose between right and wrong , good and evil .
look into the bottom of your soul and find what is pure and offer it to the lord .
that is the only way to salvation .
alright , enough .
there' s nothing like exercise before dinner .
anyway , someone should eat less potatoes .
hands along your sides .
frances , not only are your breasts the smallest i' ve ever seen , but you don' t even have nipples !
did you notice ?
that can' t be normal , right ?
we agree .
frances has the smallest breasts .
who has the biggest ?
i' d say patricia .
no .
she has a big behind .
turn around , patricia .
see ?
patricia , you have a bricklayer' s back .
with a couple of tattoos , you' d look like a sailor .
no , cecilia is surely the winner for the biggest breasts .
an applause for cecilia .
good girl .
we saw the biggest breasts , the smallest , and the biggest behind .
there is only the hairiest one left .
crispina , one step forward .
bernadette , one step forward .
get alongside of each other .
crispina , take your hands away from there !
bernadette , you have more hair there than on your head .
but the winner is ...
crispina .
crispina , you won !
why are you crying ?
i don' t know , sister .
neither do i.
we were playing .
everyone put your clothes back on !
it' s time for tea .
every day of my life belongs to you , my lord .
every act of my life should be taken with the pure intention of honoring only you .
from this moment on , i offer them to your sacred heart , and with this offering , i consecrate them to your glory .
and i will undertake them , aiming at perfection .
do not allow , my savior , that they be soiled by anything unworthy of your sacred heart .
what is going on down there ?
crispina , what are you doing ?
i don' t know , sister .
she' s very hot , sister .
take her to bed .
let' s go .
i' m sorry , sister .
i think i made a mess .
i' m sorry .
i give up everything that diminishes the value of my offering .
i give up vanity , self love , human respect .
grant to me , oh lord , the chance to begin , to go on , to finish this day in your grace , with the sole intent of pleasing and honoring you .
amen .
i am dying .
you' re not dying .
you have fever .
it' s probably the flu .
you can die from the flu .
old people die , not the young .
did you sleep here all night ?
did you pee in bed ?
i never did , even when i was little .
then why is it so wet ?
thank god it didn' t go through the other side .
otherwise , we would' ve had to tell the nuns .
you don' t want that , huh ?
hold this .
sleep with your clothes on .
i' il look for some sheets .
i can do it myself .
then do it .
i' il be right back .
what is going on now ?
i lost my medal .
my st. christopher .
relax .
let' s see if it' s on the floor .
where is my st. christopher ?
i don' t know .
where is it ?
crispina , don' t worry .
relax and lie down .
it probably fell in the cafeteria .
i' il go get it .
get under the covers like a good girl .
what' il i do ?
i' il find it .
st. christopher ...
what will i do ?
