it' s still on , and we' re going .
cyrus sent an emissary this afternoon to make sure .
cyrus don' t want anybody packed or anybody flexing any muscle .
so i gave him my word that the warriors would uphold the truce .
everybody says that cyrus is the one and only .
i think we' d better go have a look for ourself .
we ain' t even been to the bronx .
no sweat .
this conclave' s a big item .
every gang in the city will be there .
we' re going in with nothing .
we' re going in like everybody else .
nine guys , no weapons .
you got the stuff ?
i want you to hit everything in sight .
i want everybody to know the warriors were there .
you never what you' re gonna run into .
in our colours , we can' t hide .
who wants to hide ?
maybe we' il get to waste some heads along the way .
you just soldier and keep your mouth shut .
when we get there , stick close by .
sure , i don' t want to get wrecked .
one thing we might get out of cyrus' s get together is meeting some strange wool .
i wouldn' t mind laying something down on the way back .
you got a one track brain .
what' s up ?
you going faggot ?
what do you know about cyrus ?
magic .
whole lot of magic .
what do you know about cyrus ?
he' s the one and only .
when you' re president of the biggest gang , you don' t take any shit .
fuck him !
i tell you something .
i' il bet nobody' s even gonna be there .
can you count , suckers ?
i say the future is ours ... ... if you can count .
come on , cyrus .
we' re with you !
go ahead , bro !
look what we have here before us .
we' ve got the saracens sitting next to the jones street boys .
we' ve got the moon runners , right by the van courtland rangers .
nobody is wasting nobody .
that ... is a miracle .
and miracles is the way things ought to be .
yeah !
all right .
i heard that !
you' re standing right now with nine delegates from a hundred gangs .
and there' s over a hundred more .
that' s 20, 000 hard core members 40, 000 , counting affiliates , and 20, 000 more not organised , but ready to fight .
60, 000 soldiers !
there ain' t but 20, 000 police in the whole town .
can you dig it ?
can you dig it ?
can you dig it ?
now , here' s the sum total .
one gang could run this city .
one gang !
nothing would move without us allowing it to happen .
we could tax the crime syndicates , the police , because we got the streets , suckers .
can you dig it ?
right on !
the problem in the past has been the man turning us against one another .
we' ve been unable to see the truth , because we' ve been fighting for ten square feet of ground our turf , our little piece of turf .
that' s crap , brothers .
the turf is ours by right because it' s our turn .
all we have to do is keep up the general truce .
we take over one borough at a time .
secure our territory , secure our turf , because it' s all our turf .
the other way , against the crowd !
keep your ass down !
down !
get out of the way .
watch out , man .
watch his head .
what' s up with that ?
there wasn' t supposed to be guns .
is cleon all right ?
i think he' s up there .
are you sure ?
no .
come on , move it !
there he is !
that' s him !
that' s the warrior !
he shot cyrus !
i didn' t do nothing .
we saw him !
that' s him .
he' s the one .
he' s the one !
the warriors did it !
the warriors did it !
kill him !
come on !
move it !
everybody down !
shit !
you all right ?
yeah .
everybody quiet !
everybody make it ?
just cleon' s missing .
fuzz must have got him .
did you see him ?
i seen him , then he wasn' t there .
i was haulin ' ass .
look around .
make sure we' re ok .
this is a graveyard .
what are we gonna do now ?
we' re going back .
how ? !
fuckin ' coney island must be fifty to a hundred miles from here .
it' s our only choice .
real simple .
except every cop in the city' s lookin ' to bust our heads .
there' s something else to think about .
the truce , is it still on ?
if it ain' t , we' re gonna have to bop our way back .
shit , i wish we was packed .
if this truce is off , anything could hit us between here and that train .
if you get separated , make it to the platform at union square .
we change trains there .
i only got one question .
who named you leader ?
i got as much right to take over as you .
it was cleon' s choice .
swan' s war chief .
right now , cleon' s probably got a nightstick shoved up his ass .
i bet you can' t even find the subway .
let' s talk about this later .
what' s wrong with now ?
i want to be war lord .
make your move .
hey , ajax , lighten up .
big boy , swan' s war chief .
we better stick together .
hey , you guys , the train' s there .
come on .
hurry up .
let' s go .
let' s move .
don' t worry about it .
stay loose .
ah , fuck !
rembrandt , mark this spot .
hey , wait for me !
riffs !
yeah , right !
who are the warriors ?
there must be some word .
i want them all .
i want all the warriors .
i want them alive , if possible .
if not , wasted .
but i want them .
send the word .
all right , for all you boppers out there in the big city , you street people with an ear for the action ,
i' ve been asked to relay a request from the gramercy riffs .
it' s a special for the warriors .
that' s that real live bunch from coney .
and i do mean the warriors .
here' s a hit with them in mind .
be looking good , warriors , all the way back to coney .
you hear me , babies ?
good .
real good .
adios .
what kind of crap is this ?
what are we waiting for ?
a train would help , unless you want to get japped on the platform .
there ain' t no one on the street .
we' re acting like faggots .
just keep talking .
move .
that' s the turnbull a. c. ' s .
they forgot about the truce .
no shit !
those lousy skinheaded fucks .
that' s our train .
we got to make it .
jesus christ !
are we gonna go for it ?
hold the fucking train !
go , go , go !
close the fucking door !
shit !
all right , warriors !
those guys were desperate dudes .
so was we !
we can take ' em .
bunch of chicken shits !
they didn' t look too chicken to me .
me , either .
well , we made it .
in an hour , it' s c. i. the big coney .
you got it .
give me that fist .
when we get there , we' ve made it .
hey , no sweat , war chief .
i' ve got coney island !
how many stops to union square ?
come on , man .
that' s high math for rembrandt .
it' s all right .
nobody can read these maps .
what' s the difference ?
we' re home free .
we just heard from the turnbulls .
they blew it .
shit .
this train' s had it .
this is fuckin ' impossible .
what are we gonna do ?
this sucks !
why couldn' t it rain now ?
we should worry about who set that goddamn fire .
come on .
yeah .
how are you ?
i was just checking in .
yeah , it was a real mess up there .
this guy cyrus had an accident .
they did ?
well , that' s ok .
these guys , the warriors ...
yeah .
they deserve it .
yeah .
we will .
take care of yourself .
we set ?
we' re set , all right .
somebody should pick them up .
the riffs sent out the word , they want ' em alive .
we don' t .
the sooner someone grabs them , the better .
you afraid the warriors will talk before they get racked ?
i' m worried .
i don' t want the riffs after me .
they' re looking for the warriors , remember ?
we can do some looking , too .
ought to make you feel better .
what about the money you owe ?
for what ?
we' ve had it .
i made ' em .
two there , one there .
i think they just made us .
you recognise them ?
orphans .
so far down , they ain' t even on the map .
real low class .
numbers .
full strength , maybe 30 .
a lot more than eight .
not if they' re wimps .
i' m sick of this running crap .
come on .

yeah , reinforcements .
we' re gonna get japped here !
no matter what he says , nobody lip off .
nobody get hot .

when did you turn into a diplomat ?
you ain' t the state department type .
fox , come with me .
show me your invitation .
how do you figure ?
well , you come armying down here , invading our territory no permits , no parley .
we' re not invading .
i' m parleying now .
we were at the meeting in the bronx .
we' re going home to coney , the train' s messed up by the fire and dumps us here .
what are you talking about ?
how could there be a meeting without the orphans ?
you didn' t miss anything .
a lot of heads got busted .
you think the orphans ain' t with it ?
that we ain' t well known ?
we didn' t say that .
we got a heavy rep .
mess with us , you' il find out .
you see that ?
our raids are in the paper .
that' s really heavy .
the orphans , right ?
our youth worker talks about you .
we ain' t got one .
that' s because you guys are so bad , they' re afraid of you .
nothing wrong with you making it through our territory , as long as you' re coming in peace .
cut it , mercy .
you know what that is ?
yeah .
trouble .
those vests are real nice .
