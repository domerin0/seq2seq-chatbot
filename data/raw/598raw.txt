you don' t understand the way it is for somebody like me .
last month i' m eating candy to stay alive .

it doesn' t have to be that way !

you are not scared of anything .
i' m scared of everything !

it' il be fine .
where is my beige iridescent lipstick ?
i know i put it in this drawer .
baby , where are you going in this weather ?
uh , they' re having charades in the west lobby .
quite the little joiner , aren' t we ?
have you had many women ?
what ?
baby , come on .
tell me .
i want to know .
you gotta understand what it' s like .
you come from the streets and suddenly you' re up here .
women are throwing themselves at you and they smell so good .
they really take care of themselves .
i never knew women could be like that .
they' re so goddamn rich you think they must know about everything .
they' re slippin ' their room keys in my hand two and three times a day different women so , i think i' m scorin ' big , right ?
you think , " they wouldn' t be doing this if they didn' t care about me , right ?
that' s all right .
i understand .
you were just using them , that' s all .
no , that' s not it .
that' s the thing .
it wasn' t like that .
they were using me .
what' s your real name , baby ?
frances , for the first woman in the cabinet .
frances .
that' s a real grownup name .
i' ve decided to go all the way with robbie .
no , not with someone like him .
do you think if we came back for a ten year anniversary , it would be free ?
it' s just wrong this way .
it should be with someone
with someone that you sort of love .
come on .
you don' t care about me .
you wouldn' t care if i humped the entire army ... as long as we were on the right side of the ho chi minh trail .
what you care about is that you' re not daddy' s girl anymore .
he listens when i talk now .
you hate that .
two , three , cha cha cha .
my frame .
where' s my pleasing arc ?
spaghetti arms !
would you give me some tension , please ?
you' re invading my dance space .
this is my dance space .
that' s yours .
let' s cha cha .
don' t look down .
look right here .
how you call your lover boy ?
come here , lover boy .
and if he doesn' t answer ?
oh , lover boy .
and if still doesn' t answer ?
i simply say ...
baby
o oh , baby
my sweet baby
you' re the one
takin ' dance lessons ?
i could teach ya , kid .
my grandfather put me in charge of the final show .
i want to talk to you about the last dance .
i' d like to shake things up a bit .
you know , move with the times .
i' ve got a lot of ideas .
i' ve been working with the staff kids ... on a cross between a cuban rhythm and soul dancing .
whoa , boy .
way over your head here .
you always do the mambo , huh ?
why not dance this year' s final dance ... to the pachenga ?
right .
well , you' re free to do the same , tired number as last year if you want ... but next year we' il find another dance person ...
who' il only be too happy  sure , neil .
no problem .
we' il end the season with the pachenga .
great idea .
sometimes he' s hard to talk to , but the ladies seem to like him .
see that he gives you the full half hour you' re paying him for , kid .
that little wimp .
he wouldn' t know a new idea if it hit him in the pachenga .
i could have told him some new ideas .
why did you let him talk to you that way ?
what , fight the boss man ?
you tell him your ideas .
he' s a person like everyone else .
look , i know these people .
they are rich and they' re mean .
they won' t listen to me .
why not fight harder ?
make them listen .
because i need this goddamned job lined up for next summer .
my dad calls me today .
good news , " he says .
uncle paul can finally get you in the union .
what union ?
the house painters and plasterers local number 179 at your service .
i' ve been thinking a lot about the domino theory .
now , when viet nam falls , is china next ?
i don' t think they saw us .
fight harder , huh ?
i don' t see you fightin ' so hard , tellin ' daddy i' m your guy .
i will .
with my father , it' s complicated .
i will tell him .
i don' t believe you , baby .
i don' t think ... that you ever had any intention of telling him .
ever .
well , cousin , it' s almost over .
labor day weekend is here .
well , cousin , it' s almost over .
labor day weekend is here .
soon it' s back to the old books and back to work .
what a terrible thought !
have you seen johnny ?
i' m sorry .
looks like i picked the wrong sister .
that' s okay , baby .
i went slummin ' too .
hit me .
get out of here .
you' re not worth it .
win big , moe .
as always .
this is our last night together , lover .
i' ve got something worked out for us .
excuse me , sir .
the pirate number' s next .
oh , thanks .
hey , kid .
i' ve been playing cards all weekend and i' ve got an all night game tonight .
why don' t you give my wife some extra dance lessons ?
i' m sorry , mr. pressman ... but i' m booked up for the whole weekend with the show .
i won' t have time for anything else .
i don' t think it' d be fair to take the money .
i' ve decided tonight' s the night with robbie .
he doesn' t even know yet .
it' s me .
holy shit !
you wanna hear somethin ' crazy ?
last night l
i dreamt we were walking along and we met your father .
he said , " come on , " and he put his arm around me .
just like he did with robbie .
you know how you feel when you see a patient and you think he' s all right ... then you look at the x rays and it' s nothing like you thought ?
what happened ?
it' s exactly what it' s like when you find out one of your staff' s a thief .
moe pressman' s wallet was stolen when he was playing pinochle last night .
it was in his jacket hanging on the back of his chair .
he had it at 1 : 30 and when he checked again at quarter of 4 :: 00 ... it was missing .
vivian thinks she remembers this dance kid johnny ... walking by .
so we ask him , " you have an alibi for last night ?
he says he was alone in his room reading .
there are no books in johnny' s room !
there' s been a mistake .
i know johnny didn' t do it .
there' s been similar thefts at the sheldrake .
it' s happened here before .
three other wallets .
i know he didn' t do it .
stay out of it , baby .
wait .
don' t put those tables together .
come on .
daddy , i need your help .
i know johnny didn' t take moe' s wallet .
oh ?
how do you know ?
i can' t tell you .
just please trust me , daddy .
i' m sorry , baby .
i can' t .
this danish is pure protein .
maybe johnny didn' t do it .
anyone could' ve taken it .
maybe it was , uh
it could' ve been that little , old couple , the schumachers .
i saw her with a couple of wallets .
sylvia and sidney ?
baby , you don' t go around accusing innocent people .
i even saw them at the sheldrake .
you said something was stolen from there .
i got an eyewitness and the kid has no alibi .
come on , neil .
you' il learn what it' s like to fire an employee .
wait a minute .
i know johnny didn' t take the wallet .
i know because he was in his room all night .
and the reason i know is because i was with him .
i told you i was telling the truth .
i' m sorry i lied to you .
but you lied too .
you told me everyone was alike and deserved a fair break .
but you meant everyone who is like you .
you told me you wanted me to change the world , to make it better .
but you meant by becoming a lawyer or an economist ... and marrying someone from harvard .
i' m not proud of myself .
but i' m in this family too .
you can' t keep giving me the silent treatment .
there are a lot of things about me that aren' t what you thought .
but if you love me , you have to love all the things about me .
and i love you .
i' m sorry i let you down .
i' m so sorry , daddy .
but you let me down too .
i have been lookin ' for you all over .
they found the schumachers .
fingerprinted their water glasses .
found out they were wanted in arizona and in florida ... and they made a fortune here this summer .
so then it' s all right .
i knew it would work out .
i knew they' d have to apologize .
i' m out , baby .
they fired you anyway because of me .
and if i leave quietly , i' il get my summer bonus .
so i did it for nothing .
i hurt my family , you lost your job anyway i did it for nothing !
no , not for nothing .
nobody has ever done anything like that for me before .
you were right .
you can' t win no matter what you do .
listen to me .
i don' t want to hear that from you .
you can .
i used to think so .
dr. houseman , can i , uh
look , i' m going anyway and i know what you must be thinking .
you don' t know anything at all about me .
i know you want baby to be like you .
the kind of person people look up to .
baby is like that .
if you could just see
don' t you tell me what to see .
i see someone in front of me who got his partner in trouble ... and sent her off to some butcher ... while he moved on to an innocent , young girl like my daughter .
yeah , i guess that' s what you would see .
i can' t imagine being here without you even one day .
just think , you have more time for horseshoes and croquet .
maybe they' il saw you in seven pieces now .
i guess we surprised everybody .
i guess we did .
hardly would be sorry .
neither will l .
i' il see ya .
i' il do your hair .
it could look pretty if
you' re prettier your way .
this way .
kellermans , we come together
singing all as one
we have shared another season' s
talent , play and fun
summer days will soon be over
soon the autumn starts
and tonight the memories whisper
softly in our hearts
join hands and hearts and voices
voices , hearts and hands
at kellerman' s the friendships last
long as the mountain stands
daytime , nighttime , any hour
weather rain or shine
games and lectures jokes and music
happily combine
good luck in medical school , son .
and i wanted to thank you for your help with the penny situation .
i guess we' ve all gotten into messes .
what ?
i thought baby told you .
look , i' m not sure .
penny said so , but you know with girls like that .
they' re liable to pin it ... on any guy around .
what' s the hot tip for the day ?
finished .
you and me , tito .
we' ve seen it all , eh ?
bubbah and zeda serving the first pasteurized milk to the boarders .
through the war years when we didn' t have any meat .
through the depression when we didn' t have anything .
lots of changes , though , max .
it' s not the changes so much this time .
it' s that it all seems to be ending .
you think kids want to come with their parents and take fox trot lessons ?
trips to europe , that' s what the kids want .
twenty two countries in three days .
it feels like it' s all slipping away .
but the heartbeats of vacation
there no cares are seen
so let' s join in just one last chorus
visitors , staff and guests
what we' ve shared won' t be forgotten
old friends are the best
nobody puts baby in the corner .
come on .
sorry about the disruption , folks ... but i always do the last dance of the season .
this year somebody told me not to .
so i' m gonna do my kind of dancin ' with a great partner ... who' s not only a terrific dancer ... but somebody who' s taught me that there are people ... willing to stand up for other people no matter what it costs them .
somebody who' s taught me ... about the kind of person i want to be .
miss frances houseman .
sit down , jake .
i think she gets this from me .
do you have sheet music on this stuff ?
i know you weren' t the one who got penny in trouble .
when i' m wrong , i say i' m wrong .
you looked wonderful out there .
now i
had the time of my life
no , i never felt this way before
yes , i swear
it' s so true and i owe it all to you
