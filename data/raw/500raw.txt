ooh , those hookers let you down .
what are you gonna do when you run outta gas , call aaa ?
you sucker for the babes , you .
you ain' t even gonna make it to the pits .
you shut the hell up .
i' il make it .
not unless you keep your eyes on the road , sugar pie .
watch it !
ah , this is great .
just like being in a buddy movie .
shut up !
boy , you' re screwed .
you' re out .
you' re finished .
stick a fork in it .
you' re swirling around the bottom of the bowl , nose diving down the pipe .
it' s over .
you' re flushed .
this time , i can' t bring myself to tell him to shut up .
sure , he' s an asshole .
sure , he' s dead .
sure , i' m just imagining that he' s talking .
none of that stops the bastard from being absolutely right .
i don' t have a chance in hell of outrunning this cop .
not in this heap .
pull over !
the only question left is whether i' m gonna kill him or not .
tough call .
for all i know , he' s an honest cop , regular guy , a working stiff with a mortgage , a wife and a pile of kids .
my hand moves all on its own , sliding one of my guns to my lap and thumbing back the hammer .
i don' t know what to do .
you better stop .
you' re making him mad .
whatever you say .
your friend here ... party a little too hard tonight ?
i' m the designated driver .
well , you' re driving with a busted tail light .
i' il let you off with a warning .
what next ?
the tank goes dry a quarter mile from the pits .
i shove the t bird the rest of the way .
a few minutes ' more work and it' il all be over .
jackie boy will go into the damn tar pits .
i' il catch a train out of sacred oaks .
go home and call it a ...
no more questions , dallas .
do what i say .
clear the streets .
we' re in lockdown .
we' re not selling any tail in old town .
not tonight .
don' t struggle .
you' il only hurt yourself .
your cause is lost .
we know everything .
soon the corpse of detective afferty will be in our possession , and the truce between your prostitutes and the police will be shattered .
there' il be arrests .
there' il be deaths .
my employer will seize what remains of this neighborhood .
you will all be slaves .
nothing can stop this .
but it is within your power to save many lives by facilitating the process of transition , by negotiating the terms of the surrender of old town .
son of a bitch !
i know you .
i have suffered your kind before the dregs of sin city .
i serve a new master now , and soon you and all your wretched kind will serve him as well .
now , get dressed and shed a tear for dwight mccan' thy if you must , because , by now , he is surely dead .
you don' t know him .
my man will find a way .
he always finds a way .
i can' t fathom these americans always whining and going on about how they got it so bad .
this is a fine , grand country .
guiding light of the modern world , it is .
low taxes , land of opportunity .
where else would one bullet buy us the fortune that we' re getting for this ?
sure beats the living hell out of blowing up airports and churches without shite to show for it .
yeesh .
you find something , murphy ?
looks to be our poor , dead cop' s badge .
it' s all bent up .
what' s this stuck in it ?
bloody hell .
it' s the bullet .
you son of a bitch !
bastard !
they werert cops .
these four .
they were mercenaries .
and if they were hired by who i think they were .
the bad times haven' t even started yet .
and everything seemed to be going so well .
emember , we don' t have to deliver every last inch of the man , brian .
you got a good point there , onnie .
lend me your knife .
should i take a nap while i' m doing all this waiting ?
i' m at the bone , all right ?
there we go .
have you ever seen anything so pretty in your whole life ?
we' il be back for the three of you , and if anyone happens by , use your imagination , ok ?
silence .
now .
no air to breathe .
only the horrid .
oily tar taste creeping up my nostrils .
let it in .
let it fill your lungs .
they were counting on you and you blew it .
skinny .
steely fingers at my wrist .
miho .
you' re an angel .
you' re a saint .
you' re mother teresa .
you' re elvis .
you' re god .
and if you' d shown up ten minutes earlier .
we' d still have jackie boy' s head .
dwight , they got gail !
it' s a cinch .
you got yourselves a spy in old town .
a stoolie who sold you out to the mob .
we gotta find out who it is and rescue gail .
but first , we gotta get our hands on jackie boy' s head before it gets to wherever it' s going and this whole situation blows wide open .
miho , i hope to hell you left one of ' em alive enough to talk .
i let him know i' m not fooling around .
we talk .
stay smart .
stay cool .
it' s time to prove to your friends that you' re won' th a damn .
sometimes .
that means dying .
sometimes .
it means killing a whole lot of people .
there they are .
what do we do ?
we stop ' em , dallas .
jackie boy' s head is so close to me
i could almost reach out and grab it right then and there .
get the head !
get the head !
i got it !
i got it !
suck on this , you stupid slag !
i can' t tell if miho is alive or dead .
but i' m on my feet and every ounce of me wants to get some killing done .
you want the head now , sweetheart ?
so come down and get it !
brave lad .
i could' ve put a bullet straight down your ear just now , if i hadrt got me revolver all wet and useless .
you got the drop on me , love .
i' m as helpless as a baby .
i got to come clean with you , sweetheart .
it was an outright lie i was giving ya about me revolver being wet .
you see , i' m not too fond of shootir .
it' s my preference to blow things up .
once you blast the roof off a pub and seen all the parts flying off people , a little bang bang' s never gonna match the sight of that .
and here' s me , with all these fine grenades and such a sweet beauty of a remote .
but it' s me knife i' il be doing you with .
you killed me mates .
someone shoulda told ya never give an irishman good cause for revenge .
deadly little miho .
you won' t feel a thing unless she wants you to .
she twists the blade .
he feels it .
i tell miho what we' re gonna do and how we' re gonna do it .
i grab poor dallas' s car phone and make the most important call of my life .
first .
we gotta rescue gail .
then comes the kill .
the big .
fat kill .
do we just gotta stand here and watch this ?
what , are you kidding me , man ?
i could watch old manute do his thing all night long and not get tired of it .
i mean , the mars an artist .
only an artist should be allowed to touch such a beautiful subject .
your skin is perfect .
your nerves , responsive .
beautiful .
just give them what they want , gail .
becky ?
it' s over , gail .
there' s no fighting them .
dwight' s dead .
they got what' s left of that cop we killed .
the mob' s gonna turn it over to the police chief , the cops are gonna mow us down .
we gotta cut a deal .
you little bitch !
you sold us out !
i didn' t have no choice !
they was gonna hurt my mom .
you gotta cut a deal with these people .
it' s selfish , you holding out like this .
you' re gonna get a lot of girls killed for no good reason .
it wasrt your mom !
we could have protected her and you know it .
it was the money , you stupid little bitch !
sure , there' s money .
sure , you could' ve moved my mom into old town and let her know that her daughter' s a goddamn whore .
breaks your heart , doesn' t it ?
they offered me what you couldn' t never offer me a way out .
i had to watch out for my own neck .
your neck .
your precious , scrawny little neck !
you' re crazy !
you could have ripped my throat out , you crazy whore !
schutz , fetch my blades .
stuka , kill this one .
no , i was promised !
stupid little bitch !
you deserve worse !
i knew there was a reason i got out of bed this morning .
hey .
hey .
nobody .
i don' t see nobody .
will you look at that ?
it' s right through me .
guys , look .
there' s something wrapped around it .
some kind of note .
give it to me .
it' s poked right through me .
guys , look .
it' s starting to really hurt .
out back .
everyone .
and bring the women .
do you think somebody should call me a doctor or something ?
mccan' thy , you fool .
hey .
guys ?
aw .
dozens of them .
armed to the teeth .
i' m outnumbered .
outgunned .
but the alley is crooked .
dark and very narrow .
they can' t surround me .
sometimes .
you can beat the odds with the careful choice of where to fight .
you can have old town , i don' t care .
just give me the woman .
shut up .
dwight , don' t do this .
hey , wait a minute .
something' s not right .
shut up , or i' il plug you !
of course , mr. mccan' thy .
a fair trade .
she' s all yours .
now , if you' il explain to me why we shouldn' t blow both of you to pieces ...
dwight , what have you done ?
exactly what i had to .
every step of the way .
no !
it isn' t right !
there wasrt no tape over his mouth !
how come there' s tape over his mouth ?
where to fight counts for a lot .
cute trick , mccan' thy , but it will do you do good .
but there' s nothing like having your friends show up with lots of guns .
no !
mccan' thy , you shit !
the girls all know the score .
no escape .
no surrender .
no mercy .
we gotta kill every last rat bastard one of ' em .
every last one .
not for revenge .
not because they deserve it .
not because it' il make the world a better place .
we need a heap of bloody bodies so when mob boss wallenquist looks over his charts of profits and losses .
he' il see what it cost him to mess with the girls of old town .
they run out back .
right on schedule .
deadly little miho .
she gets her practice in .
the valkyrie at my side is shouting and laughing with the pure .
hateful .
bloodthirsty joy of the slaughter .
and so am i.
the fire .
baby .
it' il burn us both .
there' s no place in this world for our kind of fire .
my warrior woman .
my valkyrie .
you' il always be mine .
always ... and never .
just one hour to go .
my last day on the job .
early retirement .
not my idea .
doctor' s orders .
heart condition .
angina . " he calls it .
i' m polishing my badge and getting myself used to the idea of saying goodbye to it .
it .
and the 30 odd years of protecting and serving and tears and the blood and terror and triumph it represents .
i' m thinking about eileers slow smile .
about the thick .
fat steaks she picked up at the butcher' s today .
and i' m thinking about the one loose end i haven' t tied up .
a young girl who' s out there somewhere .
helpless in the hands of a drooling lunatic .
damn it , hartigan , i won' t let you do this .
you' re gonna get yourself killed .
you' re gonna get us both killed .
i won' t let you .
i' m warnir you .
let go of my coat , bob .
you' re draggir me down with you .
i' m your partner .
they can kill me , too .
i ain' t puttir up with that .
i' m gettir on the horn and calling for backup .
sure , bob .
we' il just wait .
sit on our hands while that oark brat gets his sick thrills with victim number four .
victim number four !
nancy callahan , age 11 .
and she' il be raped and slashed to ribbons .
and that backup that we' re waitir on will just so happen to show up just late enough for oark to get back to his us senator daddy .
take a deep breath , hartigan .
settle down and think straight .
you' re pushir 60 and you got a bum ticker .
you ain' t savir anyone .
you got a great attitude , bob .
eal credit to the force , you are .
eileers at home waitir for you .
think about eileen .
heck , bob , maybe you are right .
i' m glad to hear you' re finally talkir sense .
hell of a way to end a partnership .
hell of a way to start my retirement .
nancy callahan .
age 11 .
for all i know .
she' s dead already .
you' ve been a very good girl , nancy .
you' ve been very quiet .
don' t be scared .
we' re gonna be taking you home really soon .
but first , we' re going to introduce you to somebody .
he' s a very nice man .
halfvway to the warehouse where weevil said they took her .
and it hits .
wicked spot of indigestion .
at least that' s what i pray it is .
... lighthearted and momentary digression .
the briefest indulge ment in automotive pleasure .
for cheap thrills .
such short lived durability , mr. shlubb .
you would risk engender ating ill will on the part of our employers .
burt shlubb and douglas klump two any dirty job there is thugs with delusions of eloquence .
this jaguar you so pineadedly covet temporarily remanded to our custody though it may be remains the property of the son of senator oark .
gotta keep this quiet .
take ' em down fast .
a single dent , the merest scratch thereupon , and the before mentioned consequences of which i so recently made mention shall surely be athwart us .
catch your breath .
give your heart time to slow down .
but it won' t slow down .
get over it .
she needs you .
we' re all done here , benny .
let' s give them some time together .
give them some privacy .
be with you in a minute , lenny .
i' m just making sure they get along really well .
and what kind of beast couldn' t get along with a precious little girl like this ?
you must be awfully scared now .
but you' ve got nothing to be scared of .
all we' re gonna do is have a nice little talk .
that' s all .
just a nice talk .
just you and me .
don' t you cry now .
doctor said it' d be like this .
just take the pill he gave you .
no need to play it quiet .
not anymore .
breathe steady .
old man .
prove you' re not completely useless .
what the hell ?
go out with a bang .
he likes to hear ' em scream .
i' ve seen his victims and their twisted little faces .
all wide mouthed and bug eyed .
frozen in their last horrible moment of living .
no screams .
either i' m just in time .
or i' m way too late .
ooh !
it' s nothing .
barely a flesh wound .
on your feet .
old man .
oark .
give it up .
let the girl go .
you can' t do a goddamn thing to me , hartigan .
you know who i am .
you know who my father is !
you can' t touch me , you piece of shit cop .
look at you .
you can' t even lift that cannon you' re carrying .
sure , i can .
cover your eyes , nancy .
i don' t want you watching this .
i mean it , baby .
cover your eyes right now .
i take his weapons away .
both of them .
hell of a way to end a partnership .
for god' s sakes , don' t make it any worse .
don' t make me kill you .
doir fine , bob .
never better .
i' m ready to kick your ass .
keep him talking .
buy time .
just a few more minutes .
just till the backup gets here .
sit down and stay down .
i' il kill you if i have to .
keep his mind off the girl skinny little nancy .
he can' t kill her once the backup gets here .
un home , nancy .
un for your life .
hey .
don' t listen to him .
he' s a crazy man .
what a tough man you are , huh ?
you stay right where you' re at .
you shoot your partner in the back ... then you try to scare a little girl .
maybe i' il pull my spare rod , plug you a couple of times , show you how it' s done .
we could' ve worked something out , but you' ve blown that .
sit down or i' il blast you in half .
you' re so slow , you' il never stop me .
sit down !
you' il never be able to stop me .
i finally sit down .
just like you told me to .
the sirens are close now .
she' il be safe .
things go dark .
i don' t mind much .
getting sleepy .
it' s ok .
she' il be safe .
an old man dies .
a little girl lives .
fair trade .
just tell me it isn' t true , john .
what they' re saying about you and that child .
it can' t be true .
if you ever want to see me again ... say something now .
we' re looking at your basic mountain of dna evidence , the testimony of your own partner , corroboration by six eye witnesses and that' s just so far and there' s your own silence .
i' il do what i can , but needless to say , you are good and screwed .
come on , hartigan .
what' s holding you back ?
what' s shutting you up ?
this whole thing stinks to high heaven .
i' m not the only one on the force who smells it .
sure , i' il rinse your bedpan and wipe your butt .
that' s my job .
but don' t expect any friendly chitchat outta me , mister .
i heard what you' ve done to that girl .
i hope they throw away the key .
evenir , officer .
i don' t have to introduce myself , do i ?
you read the papers .
this being an election year , you' ve seen plenty of my picture .
you know who i am and what i can do .
and i' m doir you , hartigan .
cold and hard , i' m doing you .
you blew my sors ear off .
you blew his arm off .
you even blew his nuts and his pecker off .
he' s in a coma right now .
they say he may never come out of it .
my boy .
he could' ve been the first oark to become the president of the united states , but you went and turned him into a brain damaged , dickless freak .
pullir that trigger make you feel powerful ?
power don' t come from a badge or a gun .
power comes from lying .
lying big , and gettir the whole damn world to play along with you .
once you got everybody agreeing with what they know in their hearts ain' t true , you' ve got ' em by the balls .
there' s what , maybe 500 people in this hospital ?
i could pump you full of bullets right now , and i wouldn' t even be arrested .
everyone would lie for me everyone who counts .
otherwise , all their own lies everything that runs sin city it all comes tumbling down like a pack of cards .
but i want you firm and fit and healthy .
i' m even putting up cash of my own to get you more surgery .
fix that heart condition of yours .
you' re gonna keep on living a long time .
i' m gonna make sure of that .
you' re gonna be convicted of raping that little brat , and shooting my boy .
and you' re gonna spend the rest of your life in prison , disgraced , destroyed ... alone .
your wife ?
you tell her the truth and she' s dead .
you tell anybody the truth and they' re dead .
they won' t let me testify .
i told the cops that you saved my life and they just acted like i was crazy .
they talked my parents into keeping me away .
they said that you' d done things that you didn' t do .
i told them that you saved me from that oark creep , but they won' t even check me out to see that i' m still a virgin .
i' m still a virgin , still alive thanks to you .
they got it all backwards .
sometimes , the truth doesn' t matter like it ought .
but you' il always remember things right .
that' s gonna mean a lot to me .
but stay away , nancy .
they' il kill you if you don' t stay away .
don' t visit me .
don' t write me .
don' t even say my name .
maybe you won' t let me visit , but i' il still write to you , hartigan .
i' il sign my letters " cordelia .
that' s the name of a really cool detective in books i read .
i' il write you every week ... for forever .
sure , kid .
now , run on home .
it' s not safe for you here .
bye , nancy .
i love you .
john hartigan .
mr. law and order .
mr. by the book .
mr. high and mighty .
i gotta give you credit , being such a straight arrow for so damn many years without it catching up with you .
it' s catching up with you now , friend of mine .
it' s catching up with you but good .
maybe i oughta look at him .
he doesn' t look too good .
ohh , he' s hale and hearty , tammy .
see ?
he' s the picture of health .
that tammy , there she' s fine , isn' t she ?
i rented her out of old town .
i wanted to show you what you won' t be getting any of , not in prison .
you hear me , hartigan ?
if you stop being stupid , start playing along with us , you might just get some of tammy .
you see that ?
she flinched .
you make her sick .
she heard about you and that little girl .
this is nothing but a price i promised myself i' d pay .
and i' m paying it .
you don' t save a little girl' s life .
then turn around and throw her to the dogs .
not in my book .
you don' t .
they want a confession .
they won' t get it .
there was a letter from nancy waiting when they put me in solitary .
she calls herself " cordelia .
just like she promised .
she makes no mention of anything that would give her away .
at first .
i figure she' il send another note or two before her young mind moves on to better things .
but every thursday .
another one arrives .
what a sweet kid .
i do my best to keep my hand from shaking when i reach for it .
she' s the only friend i' ve got the daughter i never had .
my sweet cordelia .
skinny little nancy callahan .
eight years pass .
then comes a thursday when i bound from my cot .
excited as a kid at christmas .
only to find myself staring at the damn floor of my damn cell .
iooking for a letter from nancy that isn' t there .
then another thursday with no letter .
is she all right ?
did something happen to her ?
nothing .
two months now not a word from nancy .
did they find her ?
did they get to her ?
of course !
stupid old man .
do your math .
nancy' s 19 years old .
how long did you expect her to keep writing ?
she was a saint to keep it up as long as she did .
she' s forgotten you .
old man .
you' re alone .
you' re all alone .
this guy smells awful like bad food .
like a corpse left in a garbage dumpster in the middle of summer .
he stinks so bad .
i want to throw up .
practically knocked my head off .
the bastard .
when i come to .
i see it .
the same kind of envelope nancy always uses .
but there' s no letter inside of it .
there' s something soft .
something that ought to be alive a hunk of meat and bone that ought to be the index finger of the right hand of a 19 year old girl .
how the hell did they find her ?
she was so careful .
she never gave away where she lives or where she works .
i' ve got to get out .
i' ve got to help her .
nothing else matters not my life and not my pride .
either .
it' s only one final surrender they want .
you got me .
roark .
you beat me .
i' il get it , claire .
that' il be marv .
he never sleeps .
he' s always getting himself in deep .
yeah ?
what ?
hartigan .
my god , it is you .
yes , yes ...
i' il get right on it .
ight this second .
i' il be there by ten , i promise .
lucille .
she wouldn' t give up on me back before the trial .
she almost slugged me when i stopped her from hiring a new attorney .
when i refused to plead innocent .
she did slug me .
if she hears what i' m gonna do .
she' il probably slug me again .
hartigan ...
hot damn .
it' s like they were waiting for my call .
they' re ready to deal .
they' re practically begging for a deal .
they' re scared of something .
one of them as much as promised me parole if you confess and express regret and all that other dumb crap that , of course , we won' t go for .
we' re getting you out for time served , with no strings attached .
then we' re gonna sue those sorry sons of bitches for false prosecution .
you' re gonna be exonerated , and a very rich man .
this isn' t like you think it is .
the hell it isn' t .
anyone can figure out who framed you , but even senator oark isn' t god .
you hung up the phone too soon .
we use the law , the press ...
he will never know what hit him .
i' m gonna confess .
excuse me ?
john hartigan , crawling on his belly in front of a parole board ?
confessing to raping a little girl and blubbering for mercy ?
no , doesn' t work .
i' m going in there telling them i' m a twisted , wretched child molester , agreeing to anything they want from me .
all right , you son of a bitch .
let' s get this over with .
i say everything they want to hear .
just the way they want to hear it .
i tell them i' m a twisted .
wretched child molester .
i agree to everything they want from me .
i love you .
nancy .
it' s a lot of miles into town , hartigan .
you care for a ride ?
long as you stay in front of me .
prisors made you paranoid .
talk about water under the bridge .
christ .
eight years .
yeah .
eight years .
well , if it' s any consolation to you ... you made me hate myself .
any word from eileen ?
yeah .
she got remarried four years ago .
she had two kids .
i' m sorry , john .
don' t be .
i' m glad .
eileen always wanted kids .
she' il make a good mother .
like you said , bob water under the bridge .
bob and i get on with our fond farewells to each other .
then i go looking for the only human being on the planet who means a damn to me
nancy .
how could they have found out it was you writing all those letters to me ?
how did they find out who you are ?
and what have they done to you .
baby ?
not a sound .
no sign of life .
has roark gone to all this trouble just to torture a broken old man .
like a kid poking at a fly when he' s already torn his wings off ?
what has he done to nancy ?
it' s like all she ever does is read and study and write .
no diary .
no phone numbers or addresses written down anywhere .
closest thing to a clue is a pack of matches from a lousy saloon .
it' s a long shot .
but maybe she' s got some friends there .
a dead end .
nancy wouldn' t have anything to do with a pack of drunks and losers like this .
but if there' s anything to be found here .
the faintest lead to wherever nancy is or whoever kidnapped her and mutilated her .
this is the place .
excuse me , miss .
wondering if you could help me .
i' m looking for somebody .
cold night like this , everybody' s looking for somebody , stranger .
it' s not like that .
her name is nancy .
eyes to the stage , pilgrim .
she' s just warming up .
skinny little nancy callahan .
she grew up .
she filled out .
nancy callahan .
19 years old .
and here i was .
expecting a skinny little bookworm .
maybe a bit too shy for her own good .
how little she told me about herself in all her letters for all those years .
how the hell did they find her ?
then it hits me .
they were bluffing .
i' ve led them straight to her .
she hasn' t spotted you yet .
turn around and walk out the door .
lead the creep outside .
get that beretta away from him somehow .
and kill him .
i' m just a horny ex con watching an exotic dancer .
just a few seconds and she' il be safe .
no .
nancy .
don' t notice me .
don' t recognize me .
there' s no time to explain .
i' ve made a terrible mistake , put you in terrible danger .
we need to get out of here right this second .
whatever you say , hartigan .
let me throw some clothes on .
and here i' d figured you' d forgotten all about me .
me and my dumb letters .
kept me going .
kept me from killing myself .
hurry up , will you ?
maybe i should drive .
not a chance .
nobody but me can keep this heap running .
besides , from the sound of things , you might have to shoot somebody .
i don' t have a gun .
under the seat .
it' s loaded and it works .
yeah , this' il do .
taken it to the range a couple of times .
kicks like a mule .
hartigan , there' s so much i' ve wanted to say to you .
you' ve never been far from my thoughts .
i' ve lain awake nights , thinking of you .
what are you talking about ?
keep driving , nancy .
keep driving and keep the car on the road !
she' s counting on you .
old man .
what are you doing ?
prove you' re still won' th a damn .
try and keep it on the road , nancy !
he' s a decent shot .
he' s got skill .
but he' s in too much of a hurry .
throwing away bullets like they were candy .
he doesn' t know how to take his time .
aim careful and look the devil in the eye .
stop the car , nancy .
gotta confirm the kill .
what ?
stop the car , now !
ight .
stop the car , confirm the kill .
sorry .
i got a little rattled .
it' s ok .
you did great .
sit tight .
i' il be right back .
no !
let me stay close .
nothing can happen to me when i' m with you .
please ?
let me stay close .
the stink i almost gag .
his blood smells even worse than he does .
jesus .
and it' s all over the place .
but the creep himself .
he' s gone .
we' re out of time .
the sirens i used to welcome the sound .
there' s nothing to do now but find a place to hole up for the night .
get nancy calmed down .
and figure out what on earth i' m going to do next .
the stink somehow it stays with us all the way to the motel .
nancy , i went to your apartment .
your window was thrown wide open .
the rooms looked almost empty .
that' s why i was sure you' d been kidnapped .
my window ?
obbed again ?
that' s the third time this year !
i swore if i ever saw you again , i' d show you i grew up strong .
but there i was , just like before , scared and helpless .
i' m such an asshole .
you should sit down .
you' il feel a little bit better if you sit down .
i' ve never been all that good with people .
when it comes to reassuring a traumatized 19 year old .
i' m as expert as a palsy victim doing brain surgery with a pipe wrench .
it' s always been you , hartigan .
all these years .
it' s just nerves making you say that , nancy .
you' re just exhausted .
you need to sleep .
sleep with me .
stop it , nancy !
eight years .
why do you think i kept writing you those letters ?
it wasrt just gratitude .
i tried to fall in love with boys .
even thought i did once or twice .
but i was already in love ... with you .
no .
there' s wrong and there' s wrong and then there' s this .
for god' s sakes , you' re just a kid !
i love you .
i love you , too .
with all my heart .
cold shower it helps .
no , nancy .
ecognize my voice , hartigan ?
ecognize my voice , you piece of shit cop ?
i look different , but i bet you can recognize my voice .
sure .
i recognize your voice , junior .
everything' s gone straight to hell .
i' ve been suckered into betraying the only friend i' ve got .
and put her in the hands of a murdering rapist i thought i' d put down for good .
suckered by a spoiled brat son of a senator .
it' s all gone to hell .
klump , it' s me .
i got a dead man needs to be fetched .
i want you to set me up for a party .
i' ve already got the girl , you dumb shit !
hey , it better be perfect or i' m calling my dad !
my tools better be clean and sharp .
it better be ready !
it better be perfect !
i get to do whatever i want , however i want , whenever i want it !
my dad i' d love him if i didn' t hate him .
he spent a fortune hiring every expert on the planet to grow back that equipment you blew off from between my legs , just so the old fart can hold out some kind of hope of having a grandkid .
although , as you can see , there were some side effects .
i' m not complaining , though .
since you' ve been gone ,
i' ve been having the time of my life .
and now you' ve led me back to your darling cordelia .
we all wondered who wrote all those letters .
she left not a clue .
clever girl .
and so pretty , so pretty .
a little old for my taste , but i can forgive that just this once .
nancy , don' t scream .
whatever he does to you , don' t scream .
she' il scream .
i' m gonna take all night doing dear old nancy .
and you' re gonna die knowing that it' s all your fault .
they' ve all screamed , hartigan .
dozens of them maybe a hundred .
eight years ' won' th .
every one of them has screamed .
and if there werert so many people hereabout ,
i would show you how i' m gonna make dear old nancy scream .
it' s gonna be one hell of a show !
this is it .
no way to fight it now .
no hope left .
no chance .
this is it .
this is the end .
no .
give it a shot .
old man .
keep your neck tight .
move .
the window maybe there' s an alarm .
the window .
keep your neck tight .
goddamn it !
stay conscious !
stay conscious .
no alarm .
the glass !
cut the rope .
you can do it .
you can do it .
it is inclement upon me to comment with marked displeasure on your rash impulsiveness in selecting such an eye catching and impractical car to heist , mr. shlubb .
protest though you might , mr. klump , you must nonetheless admit the phallic magistry of said ferrari' s performance .
an engine of cyclopean power throbs beneath this steel stalliors hood .
irrelevant to said mission is the following query , which i now put forth to you .
wherein this most streamlined and trunkless of transports boner inspiring though it may be wherein are we to reposit our recently deceased cargo ?
a won' thy concern .
neatly elucidated .
i can only express puzzlement that borders on alarm .
tell me where oark takes the girls or i' il cut your damn head off !
in plain english , creep !
the answer you seek is rural , even agrarian .
the farm !
that' s all i need to hear .
every cop on the force knows about the roark family' s farm and to stay away from it .
shlubb and klump were packing an arsenal .
once things get loud .
i' il probably have use for the cannons .
but at first .
i' il have to play it quiet .
quiet and nasty .
nancy' s car six miles from the farm .
nobody but me can keep this heap running . " she told me .
good girl .
the car stalled out on that yellow bastard and you didn' t tell him how to start it up again .
you kept your mouth shut .
i' il bet junior was furious .
i' il bet he slapped you around something fierce .
but you stayed strong .
you bought a few extra minutes .
there' s still a chance .
nancy .
don' t scream .
i ditch the car a mile or so from the farm and make my way through the woods .
i' m not halfvway there when it hits .
my heart .
can' t be my heart .
i was cured .
bad cough blood in it .
doesrt matter now .
i don' t have to stay alive that much longer .
anyway .
rotten way to kill a man .
but it' s quiet .
hate yourself later .
you' re only making this worse for yourself , you stupid cow !
do you think i' m tired ?
is that it ?
do you think i' m getting tired ?
you' re the one who' s gonna crack !
you' il crack !
you' il cry and beg !
you' il scream !
oh , yeah , you' il scream , you big , fat , ugly cow !
you' il scream !
you' re thinking the whip was the worst i could do ?
that was foreplay .
hartigan was right about you .
you can' t get it up unless i scream .
you' re pathetic !
you' re pathetic .
it' s not wise at all to make fun of me like that .
it brings out the worst in me .
stupid old man !
in too much of a hurry .
damn !
it can' t be !
charging in like galahad .
just like i told myself i wouldn' t !
stupid old man !
you tagged him good !
don' t take no chances .
perforate the fool .
good advice .
give it up , junior .
it' s over .
let her go .
you' re dreaming , hartigan !
i get to see your eyes while i fillet the woman of your dreams right in front of you !
look at you !
you' re about to keel over !
you can' t even lift that cannon !
sure , i can .
you gave me a scare there for a second there , old man .
nancy , i' m sorry .
i' m taking no chances with you .
first i soften you up , and then it' s showtime .
here it comes .
it' s gonna hurt .
you' re right about that .
sucker .
i take away his weapon .
both of them .
eight long years , son of a bitch !
after a while .
all i' m doing is pounding wet chunks of bone into the floorboards .
so i stop .
so long , junior .
been a pleasure .
i didn' t scream , hartigan , not once .
i didn' t scream .
i know it , baby .
you grew up strong .
by the time i get her to the car .
nancy stops shaking .
her skin is warm again .
she' s herself again .
thanks for remembering my coat .
and for all the little things .
like saving my life , twice .
you better get rolling .
you' re not coming along ?
no .
i have friends on their way , to collect evidence .
i' m gonna blow this whole sick mess wide open .
i' m gonna clear my name .
i' m gonna put senator oark behind bars where he belongs .
i can' t lose you , not again .
you' il never lose me , nancy .
nancy callahan .
the love of my life .
shame to lie to her .
i hope she forgives me for it .
get senator roark behind bars ?
sure .
and maybe after i' ve pulled off that miracle .
i' il go and punch out god .
there isn' t a prosecutor in the state who' il go after senator roark .
i killed his only son .
the bloodline is cut .
roark' s lost his goddamn legacy .
he' il use all his power to get revenge on me .
he' il go after me through nancy .
he' il find her again .
there' il be no end to it .
she' il never be safe .
not as long as i' m alive .
there' s only one way to beat him .
an old man dies .
a young woman lives .
fair trade .
i love you .
nancy .
