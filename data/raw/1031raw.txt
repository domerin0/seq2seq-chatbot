come on , drink up .
take the boss home .
big boss , please .

we' re leaving already ?
let him pass .
spoilsports .
too weak , sir ?
too strong .
brother ... shouldn' t we call a truce with the enemy ?
you' re getting soft .
can' t be so headstrong .
we' re not young anymore .
cops are already here .
dump it somewhere .
hope the boss went home .
and not to his mistress' s .
why the fuck are you here ?
that' s how it is ... so might as well come to an agreement .
we don' t want it to get out of hand .
better to disband the family .
he says he' il look after you .
goddamn it , this is a wake .
shit happens .
shit happens " ?
what' s with this tie ?
back off , punk .
i have a wife and children ... and my men .
i cut off my finger .

sorry , brother .
never mind .
i' il talk to aniki for you .
well , see you .
aren' t you ashamed of yourself ?
you' re out of line .
i declare this to mr. harada and the ten men who will become dependents .
as you drink the sacred sake before you ... you will become members of the hisamatsu family .
as you may already realize ... in the strict world of the yakuza ... even if your boss tells you white is black ... you must put aside all reservations and agree to his view .
damn hisamatsu .
why is he taking that bastard in ?
i think the police pressured him .
there was no alternative .
this way , our enemy is finished .
aniki doesn' t fit in .
it' s like he' s not needed .
' cause he' s an outsider .
after all , you were enemies .
it can' t be helped .
i' ve been told to kill you .
you' re a pain in their ass ... and they don' t trust me .
then kill me .
come on .
we' re sworn brothers .
could you leave the country ?
i' il take care of everything .
i could go to america .
