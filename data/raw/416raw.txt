my name is ash , and i am a slave .
aah !
close as i can figure it , the year is 1300 a. d. , and i' m being dragged to my death .
it wasn' t always like this .
i had a real life once .
a job .
ash to price check four .
um , hardware , aisle 12 .
shop smart .
shop s mart .
i had a wonderful girlfriend , linda .
together , we drove to a small cabin in the mountains .
it seems an archaeologist had come to this remote place ... to translate and study his latest find ,
necronomicon ex mortis ,
the book of the dead .
bound in human flesh and inked in blood , this ancient sumerian text contained bizarre burial rites , funerary incantations and demon resurrection passages .
it was never meant for the world of the living .
the book awoke something dark in the woods .
it took linda .
and then it came for me .
it got into my hand and it went bad .
so i lopped it off at the wrist .
but that didn' t stop it .
it came back .
big time .
ah !
aah !
my god !
how do you stop it ?
surround the stranger !
all right , you men , fall in !
all o ' ya , keep a pace !
where in the hell
stand fast , hellhound !
no , no .
easy now , chief .
uh , i don' t know how i got here ,
and , uh , uh , i' m not looking for any trouble .
what a piece of armor this is !
wise man !
fall back !
come on , all you men .
back on your horses .
come on !
my lord , i believe he is the one written of in the necronomicon .
he who' s prophesied to fall from the heavens ... and deliver us from the terrors of the deadites .
what , that buffoon ?
likely ... he' s one of henry' s men !
kneel , rapscallions !
i say to the pit with him !
you shall soon learn the horrors of the pit .
to the pit !
you miserable bast
get him !
get off of me !
let me go !
chain him !
ah , you' re gonna have a little bit of wee fun , mate .
to the castle !
pick up your feet !
stop draggin ' your feet !
come on !
move along !
come on , now .
come on , pick it up .

you men got something to look forward to ... when you get back to the castle .

charlatan !
aah !
it was you who first turned your swords on us !
and this evil has befouled my people as well !
your people are no better than the foul corruption ... that lies in the bowels of that pit .
right , you' re no better .
may god have mercy upon your souls .
god' s name !
what hell spawned thing lurks there ?

this is my boom stick !
it' s a 12 gauge , double barreled remington .
s mart' s top of the line .
you can find this in the sporting goods department .
that' s right .
this sweet baby was made in grand rapids , michigan .

shop s mart .

yes , sir .
right .
yes , sir .
now i swear , the next one of you primates ... even touches me
now , let' s talk about how i get back home .
i prithee to forgive me , m' lord .
i believed thee one of henry' s men .
first you wanna kill me , now you wanna kiss me .
blow .
so what' s the deal ?
can you send me back or not ?
only the necronomicon has the power .
an unholy book which we also require .
within its pages are passages that can send you back to your time .
only you , the promised one , can quest for it .
i don' t want your book .
i don' t want your bullshit .
just send me back to my own time .
pronto , today , chop
you shall die !
you shall never obtain the necronomicon !
we shall feast upon your souls !
oh !
it' s a trick .
get an axe .
guards , stop it !
catch the witch !
death to the witch !
have some porridge !
ah , my eyes !
i' m blind !
oh , god , i' m blind !
no , don' t !
yo , she bitch .
let' s go .
ya hoo !
hee ya !
hee ya !
if the necronomicon fell into the hands of the deadites , all mankind will be consumed by this evil .
now will thou quest for the book ?
that one .
hee ya !
groovy .
what' s the matter ?
you raised in a barn ?
shut the door .
probably was raised in a barn with all the other primitives .
the wise men say that thou art the promised one .
' tis said that thou wilt journey for the book to help us , and that thou wilt lead our people against the evil .
the only reason i' m going to get the book is to get home .
i believe that thou wilt be leaving in the morning .
don' t touch that , please .
your primitive intellect ... wouldn' t understand alloys and compositions ... and things with molecular structures in the
what are you doin ' here anyway ?
i wanted to say that all of my all of my hopes and prayers go with you , and i made this for thee .
good , i could use a horse blanket .
gimme some sugar , baby .
hyah !
come on , boy !
hyah !
hyah !
steady now .
whoa .
what ?
what is it ?
this path will lead you to an unholy place .
a cemetery .
there , the necronomicon awaits .
when thou retrievest the book from its cradle , you must recite the words ,
klaatu barada nikto .
klaatu barada nikto .
okay .
well , repeat them .
klaatu barada nikto .
again !
i got it , i got it !
i know your damn words , all right ?
now you get this straight , the both of you .
if i get that book , you send me back .
after that , i' m history .
hyah !
what is it , boy ?

hyah !
i' m through being their garbage boy .
i did my part .
now i want back , like in the deal .
hyah !
i ... live ... again .
there !
the promised one !
the promised one' s returned !
raise the portcullis !
welcome home !
we' re saved !
the necronomicon !
truly he is the promised one !
he' s brought the necronomicon !
how are ya ?
he' s brought the book !
yeah , great , great .
good boy !
get the fuck outta my face !
the necronomicon , quickly .
did you bring the necronomicon ?
yeah , it' s , it' s just that  just what ?
nothin ' .
here .
now send me back .
like in the deal .
when you removed the necronomicon from the cradle , did you speak the words ?
yeah , basically .
did you speak the exact words ?
look , maybe i didn' t say every single , little tiny syilable ,
no , but basically i said ' em , yeah .
dung eating fool !
thou hast doomed us all !
when thou misspoke the words , the army of the dead awoke !
now , whoa , whoa , right there , spinach chin .
you said you could clean this mess up once you got that book .
you said there was a passage that could get rid of this thing and send me back .
it' s true , the book still possesses the power to send you back , but to us it is useless !
the evil has a terrible hunger for the necronomicon , and it will come here to get it .
we had a deal .
you wanted the damn book , i got it for ya .
i did my part , now you send me back .
very well .
as we are men of our word , we shall honor our bargain .
the wise men shall return you to your own time .
yeah ?
i thought he was the one .
yeah , right .
' cause that was the deal .
so when do you think we can ... start with all the thing and the
he' s nothin ' but a traitor , he is !
when do you think we can start ... with all the , uh , ceremony and , uh
agh !
wretched excuse for a man !
the wise men were fools to trust in you .
i knew he couldn' t be trusted .
we put our trust in him .
i still believe that thou wilt help us .
oh , sheila , don' t you get it ?
it' s over .
i didn' t have what it took .
so long .
but what of the things that we' ve shared ?
what of all the sweet words that you spoke in private ?
aw , well
well , that' s just what we call " pillow talk , " baby .
that' s all .
it was more than that .
i still have faith in thee .
i still believe that thou wilt stay and save us .
i
coward !
look there !
a demon !
ash !
help me !
sheila !
yaaah !
shoot the bloody thing !
hold your arms !
you' il hit the girl !
uh , me sword !
yaaah !
damn you !
dig , damn you !
dig faster !
i shall command every worm infested son of a bitch ...
that ever died in battle !
thank you , sir !

get thee hence !
a scout approaches !
whoa !
hey , get his horse .
arise .
my lord , an army of the dead gather in the wilderness .
they approach the castle .
how far from here ?
but two days ' ride .
these winged ones are only the first of them .
perhaps we should leave as soon as possible .
we could be safe in the mountains .
yes , the mountains .
we must flee !
it is written .
it has been foretold .
they' il take our souls .
they' il swallow our souls .
i' m afraid !
i don' t want to die !
that' s it .
go ahead and run .
run home and cry to mama !
me ?
i' m through runnin ' !
i say we stay here and fight it out .
are all men from the future loudmouthed braggarts ?
nope .
just me , baby .
just me .
how will we fight an army of the dead at our castle walls ?
how will you fight that ?
more words ?
most of our people have already fled .
we are but 60 men .
then we' il get henry the red and his men to fight with us .
now ... who' s with me ?
i' il stand by ya .
you can count on my steel .
i' il offer up my courage .
