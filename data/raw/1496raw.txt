in this book i collected all the prophecies of eibon , handed down from generation to generation over more then 4, 000 years .
you ungodly warlock .
because of you this hotel and this town will be cursed forever .
the seven dreaded gateways are concealed in 7 cursed places .
woe be unto him who ventures near without knowledge .
be careful what you do because this hotel was built on one of the 7 doors of evil and only i could save you .
woe be unto him who opens one of the 7 gateways to hell , because through that gateway evil will invade the world .
i told you martin , we can' t .
all i inherited was the hotel , nothing else .
but it' d be such a pity not to .
let me at least finish the plans .
no forget it .
i won' t even charge you for it .
look , really it' s not the case .
ljust wanted to clean up the outside walls a bit , and maybe tidy up inside a bit and then , well , business starts booming we' il see .
it' s better we do it now because wait four months or six and believe me , you are going to lay out .
you can' t imagine the effect that double digit inflation is having on housing .
hi larry .
how' s it going ?
oh , good morning .
i' m gonna have this whole wall finished by tonight .
great .
bye .
outside is ok .
good old 1800th louisiana , but the interior .
i mean , hotels just aren' t ...
the eyes !
the eyes !
the eyes !
eyes !
arthur .
where' s that doctor ?
he' s on his way .
this man needs to get to a hospital .
i' il clean up the wounds first .
have you got any water ?
i' m sorry , but till the plumber comes back i' m afraid i can' t get you any .
then we' d better move him right now .
give me a hand , will you ?
take the legs ... gently ... ok , up , right .
thank you doctor .
it' s ok .
how can i check up on him ?
ask me at the hospital .
john mckay .
we' re off to a great start .
let' s just hope there isn' t any lasting damage .
i sure would like to know how a man can fall off a scaffolding 6 feet wide .
liza .
hey , look at this picture .
weird .
i wasn' t aware that you had already scored a client .
client ?
there isn' t a soul here !
i guess it must have been arthur .
yeah .
hey , is anybody home ?
just a minute , i' m coming !
good morning .
are you the plumber ?
joe , right ?
yes ma' m .
what' s the trouble ?
no , thank you .

nothing comes out of the faucets , and yet somehow the basement is flooded .
you tell me .
the whole basement ?
and how !
well , let' s take a look .
ok !
follow me , this way .
off we go .
i hope it isn' t too serious .
watch out , the stairs are really slippery .
i' m an old sewer rat .
well , here it is .
how long do you think it will take ?
it' il take as long as it takes !
martha ?
i made this little pathway to the far end just forjoe .
thank you martha .
well , i' il go take that look .
where is arthur ?
he is upstairs , tidying up , we' re doing our best to help yeah , i know .

i was looking for keys .
which keys ?
i told ma i was gonna clean up the rooms but some of them are locked .
well , ljust have to find those keys , arthur , won' t i ?
or else we' il simply call a locksmith .
in the meantime , could you go up on the roof and check the chimney ?
i think it is clogged .
i heard a car drive up before .
was it joe ?
yeah .

you are liza , aren' t you ?
yes .
my name is emily .
i' ve been looking foryou .
joe !

i know the way by heart .
and there' s always dickey here .
come liza .
i' il show you the way .
joe ?
emily .
why did you say i must give up the hotel ?
i can' t explain it to you .
just take my word for it .
go back to where you came from and hurry .
what' s the matter ?
i don' t know .
he is in amazingly good condition for a corpse who is supposed to have been dead for 6 years .
well , the d . a .

how about we give it a try with ... forget it .

harris here .
miller want you up at 24 on the double .
i' m on my way honey .
wait here for me jill .
i won' t be long .
mommy !
mommy !
so , what did you do in the big apple ?
just about everything a girl could do without losing her good english breeding and reputation , modeling , dancing , secretary .
i almost became an unsuccessful fashion designer .
when this letter arrived announcing the inheritance .
big surprise , uh ?
more or less .
i mean , i knew i had a rich uncle who was a bachelor with a lot of real estate imagined for one day to the next but i neverthat i' d be running a hotel .
tell me , with all those accidents , you know , joe the plumber and the house painter .
do you think you' il give up now ?
i couldn' t do that if i wanted to .
this is my last chance .
either i run this hotel or i go on relief .
well i tell you what , when you get the hotel fixed up , i' il come and stay there so you can book me a room now .
sure , you' ve got it .
the best in the house .
of course .
how long do you think it' il be before it' s ready ?
i don' t know , it' s driving on so much .
arthur and martha are more of a hindrance then a help .
they just can' t seem to get it together .
well , if you hired them , you can fire them .
but , i can' t fire them .
they came with the hotel .
strange , i' ve never heard of them .
dr. mckay , dr .
mckay , you' re wanted on the phone .
it' s the hospital .
thank you .
excuse me .
oh ... harris , hi .
what ?
... in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us ourtrespasses , as we forgive those who trespass against us .
lead us not to temptation , but deliver us from evil .
amen . ... and as we commit the souls of joe and mary ann , to ourfather in heaven we pray together , oh merciful father , watch overjill , their daughter whom joe and mary ann' s untimely departure has left alone in this world , as a helpless child confort her , and guide her , and give her strenght we ask this , o lord , in the name of the father and of the son , and of the holy ghost .
amen .
courage , my child
liza !
liza !
liza !
emily ?
why didn' t you listen to me liza ?
we blind see things more clearly .
i wanted to spare you , but now i' il have to tell you everything .
60 years ago everybody in this hotel disappeared .
every last person .
a painter called schweik , who lived here closeted in his room had found a key .
what key ?
the seven gateways to hell .
this house was constructed on one of the ... who else is here ?
there' s nobody here .
i can feel a presence .
somebody else is in here .
no , emily .
nobody is here .
yes , it' s him .
he is here again .
he has come back to the hotel .
get ahold of yourself , emily , please .
what is this ?
that ?
a painting , just an old painting .
there' s the bell .
that' s the bell from room 36 .
that' s where he was killed , in his room !
36 was schweik' s room , the man who found the key .
he has returned , liza .
don' t ever enterthat room .
now look emily , i' ve lived in ny all my life and if there is one thing i' ve learned not to believe in it' s ghosts .
i was lucky to inherit this hotel .
the first good break i' ve had .
it' il take more than a faulty electrical contact or some crazy story to make me give it up .
emily !
emily !
emily !
liza !
john !
hey , hey , calm down , calm down .
take it easy , take it easy , come on .
but i saw him .
there , nailed to the wall .
he ... see these nails .
well , they certainly look old , but this seems more like rust than blood .
now it seems so impossible , so absurd .
and yet ... i don' t know .
now look , come and tell me exactly what you saw , hmm ?
no , never mind .
it' s useless .
i guess i must have a pretty wild imagination .
hmm ?
i got carried away with that story that emily told me about room 36 .
emily ?
who' s emily ?
the blind girl that lives in the old house by the crossroads .
there' s no blind girl living there .
and i know everyone around here .
the book !
the what ?
the book that was on the desk .
it' s gone !
open two walls and enterthe basement and then you' il have a room for a kitchen and maybe for a laundry .
huh ?
what do you think of that ?
martin , i' ve already told you .
i don' t have the money .
do whateveryou want to as long as it doesn' t cost .
i have carte blanche ?
carte blanche , but not a blank check .
okay ?
okay .
well , the first thing we do is bring someone in to pump out all the water .
that i can get done real cheap .
and then ... oh , and on the other side i' il make a living room and a game room .
have you got the original plans of the cellar by any chance ?
there was another book here .
a different one .
you wanna buy the book no , not this one .
the one that was here before , just a second ago .
that book has been there fortwo years .
nobody wants to buy it .
it' s very nice though .
very , very interesting .
liza !
what' s wrong ?
about the book ?
i was just looking for ... what ?
is anything the matter ?
you look sick .
you' re sure it' s nothing ?
i' m just a little tired that' s all .
i think i' m beginning to see things .
i get the picture .
later i' il have to go to the town hall and dig out the originals from the files .
re open that hotel ?
uh , huh .
anyway , all the turn of the century building plans are on those upper shelves there .
they should be under what the cards say , m 13, 012 .
well , let' s get them down and look at them .
