i heard that , beckett .
we got incoming bogeys .

we have a 5 mile an hour wind , midrange , coming from your lima .
attempting to confirm target .
sir , evers ' pulse , respiration and gsr are maxing out .

he made that damn shot .
i can' t believe it .
he made that goddamn shot !
game over .
your position was about to be compromised .
your directive was to abort that mission .
we' re marine scout snipers , captain .
we don' t abort unless we stop breathing .
you weren' t supposed to make that shot .
no one' s supposed to .
well , i completed my mission .
back in my days
fuck your days !
that was the luckiest fucking shot in the history of lucky fucking shots !
sorry i broke your toy , captain .
but if a sniper had to depend on that , he' d end up dead .
it' s not a video game out there .
it' s all about one shot and one kill .
you' re a risk , you know that ?
you' re a goddamn liability ... that i , for one , am not going to risk ....
getting bored , are we ?
i' m not cutting into your precious drinking time , am l ?
begging the captain' s pardon , sir , but yes , sir , i am .
and yes , sir , you are , sir .
i don' t like you , master gunnery sergeant .
and i don' t care about that fucking deal you made with the corps !
you fail that medical next week , i' il bury your ass back in the real world .
and that' s a promise .
yes , sir .
thank you , sir .
who is it ?
it' s me .
open the fucking door .
about fucking time ...

congratulations .
hey , nice going , neil , buddy .
good job .
mom , it' s time .
no , he said he' d be here .
it' s okay .
i talked to him yesterday
come on , the tv people want a shot of us cutting the cake .
we can' t wait any longer .
okay .
sorry , mom .
this looks more like a campaign photo opportunity than a wedding .
we decided to forgo the speeches today ... because of an unavoidable absence .
lf that' s beckett you' re talking about , he probably got lost on the way to the bar .
well , he' s right .
no way i could do this without a couple of tall ones .
sydney .
you knew i' d make it .
do me the honors ?
okay .
actually , these kind of affairs scare the hell out of me .
many years ago , your old man made me promise him something .
that , were he not able to attend your wedding day ...
i would read this letter to you .
lf that grunt beckett is reading this , then i didn' t make it .
i' m hoping this part of the letter is being read at your wedding .
i just wanted to let you know that i love you ... " and that i wish you and your bride nothing but happiness .
love her and cherish her always .
and may you both live as long as you want ... " and never want as long as you live .
neil , i' ve been holding onto this for a long time .
now i think it' s yours .
congratulations .
thanks , tom .
jocelyn and neil finnegan .
every time i look at neil , i see the man paul never got to be .
well , i' m sure his father would be very proud of him .
you know , this is a circus .
she' s got her eyes set on the white house , and won' t stop till she gets him there .
he' s the son of a war hero ... graduates first in his class at annapolis , harvard school of government .
climbing up the political ladder with honest living and hard work .
hell , he' s got my vote .
mine , too .
you' re hand' s shaking .
when did that start ?
a few months ago .
it' s nothing .
might be , might not .
you should stop by the office and let me look at it .
tom , come on .
okay .
we' re marine scout snipers .
the only time we abort a mission is when we stop breathing , sir .
it' s a very big mistake .
besides the obvious , his conduct record since returning from europe ... has been questionable .
psychs are a bit disturbing .
and he' s just ... old .
he' s the same age i am .
we may get one shot and one shot only .
i want beckett taking it .
you suffered nerve damage when you lost the finger .
the condition has been steadily deteriorating ever since .
the digitorum tendon ... when functioning normally , flexes and extends the finger .
but here on the damaged hand ... you could have an involuntary reflex at any time .
and it' s more likely to occur in a high stress situation .
what i see here , thomas , also looks like the early stages of palsy .
you can' t be a marine forever , you know .
yeah , i know .
i was just hoping to make it to 65 .
you know , you should think about getting on with your life .
and do what ?
well , you should meet someone special , you know , settle down .
why didn' t you ?
i did .
but i guess the few years i had with paul were enough .
and besides , you never asked me .
we had some good times , the three of us .
down at camp lejeune , remember ?
syd  don' t .
he didn' t come back .
a lot of young men didn' t come back .
why don' t you get out of that horrible motel and come and stay with me ?
tell you the truth , i' ve been living out of a sea bag all my life .
i' ve only got a few more weeks of the training sessions ... then the corps will just ship me out to some duty station .
then you should ask me to dinner sometime .
i haven' t had a date in 30 years .
i' d really appreciate it if you didn' t tell anyone about this .
okay .
thanks .
see you .
jarheads .
kiii him !
kiii him !
madness .
beckett , let' s go !
let' s get out of here !
goddamn , they' re getting close !
love it !
just cover my ass , beckett .
shit !
finnegan !
lay him down .
you' il be okay , tommy .
you' re going to be okay .
welcome to the tunnels , tommy .
can' t see a goddamn thing .
you' il get used to it .
it' s where the real shit happens , man .
here , take this .
what is it ?
good luck .
took it off a gook a couple of days ago .
nva motherfuckers !
you didn' t answer , master guns .
your door was unlocked .
lf i wanted clowns to wake me up , i would' ve joined the circus .
with all due respect , master guns , you should' ve been a comedian .
what the hell do you want ?
we have orders to take you in to see the brass , master gunnery sergeant .
yeah , well , i don' t want to see the brass .
let' s get him in the shower .
sir , you could have your pick of a dozen of the corps ' best snipers .
corporal evers is particularly good .
i' m not interested in him .
i' m interested in thomas beckett .
this is nsa deputy director william avery .
we know each other , captain .
we served together .
a lifetime ago , sir .
best goddamn sniper i had the privilege of working with .
well , thank you , sir .
what can i do for you ?
tom , i want you on a plane tomorrow .
to where , sir ?
vietnam .
i want you to take out a target there .
a mountain warlord from phum bat .
he and his rogue army ... are running opium , weapons , anything they can get their hands on .
sounds like a pain in the ass for the vietnamese , sir .
why are we getting involved ?
he' s graduated to bigger and better things .
we have intelligence that leads us to believe ... he' s been talking business with the jamaah lslamiyah .
what kind of business ?
terrorism .
he' s ventured into the big leagues .
well , with all due respect , sir , there' s not very much here .
do we even know what he looks like ?
captain laraby , would you mind excusing us ?
of course not , sir .
addis .
finnegan .
thanks , tom .
his body was shipped home .
what was left of the body .
a body .
it' s a long story , tom .
let me try to explain some of it .
during the last days before the fall of saigon , paul finnegan was recruited .
recruited by who ?
the cla .
his first op was to help the khmer rouge run heroin out of the highlands .
his cut financed the covert operations .
as the years passed , our interests changed .
finnegan was offered a new op but the jungle had changed him .
that patriotic fervor had changed into something else ... something that makes him dangerous .
he' s a threat .
to you , me , his family , and his country .
welcome to the tunnels , tommy .
what the hell' s he doing here ?
ls there any other way to handle this ?
a deal or an arrangement ?
there' s no other way .
we' ve learned the ho chi minh police ... have set up a sting to capture him .
that cannot happen .
lf he is identified , you can imagine the problems that we might face .
the explanations .
not to mention the effect on his family ... his son ....
you' re asking me to kill the man who saved my life .
i know how incredibly bizarre this must seem to you , tom ... but believe me , this is not the man that you once knew .
over the years , he has become a cold blooded killer .
and i' m ashamed to say , we bear some responsibility for that ... and an obligation to rectify the mistake .
as a sniper , you have the option to refuse the mission .
but i need an answer , tom .
by 0800 .
i' il understand if you can' t do this .
i' il find somebody else .
no .
i' il do it .
alone .
i want no observer with me .
i don' t want anybody else' s hand in it .
how can you be so sure he' il do it when the time comes ?
one way or another , he will get the job done .
it' s all he' s got left .
his iife isn' t worth a damn unless he' s risking it , or taking someone else' s .
first time in ho chi minh ?
last time i was here , it was called saigon .
beckett , thomas .
welcome to ho chi minh , mr. beckett .
first time in vietnam ?
no .
do you want anything , sir ?
lf you know what i mean , you know ?
yeah , i know what you mean , and thanks but no thanks .
sure ?
because ky mam can get you anything .
anything that you want .
any good massage ?
happy ending .
thank you , sir .
your bag has arrived , sir .
you must have the wrong room .
i already have my bags .
not this one , master gunnery sergeant thomas beckett .
my name is quan .
detective , ho chi minh city police .
also your operations contact .
like i give a shit about some badge .
what' s the operation code name ?
cobra .
come on in .
lnteresting choice of shirt .
you look like a canadian tourist .
you' il find what you need here .
they say you can make million to one shot .
you are the go to guy .
yes ?
they say a lot of things .
you rest after your trip , then we have some dinner .
we talk .
i show you the spot .
be ready 1 1 : 30 .
this bring back memories , mr. beckett ?
they told me a little about you .
two full tours .
you were here for the worst of it .
none of it was good .
you must have been very young .
okay .
who else knows i' m here besides you ?
lf you' re talking about the ho chi minh police , no one .
lf they knew , i' d be a dead man .
all right , then how do we work this ?
how do i find my target ?
two weeks ago , i arrested his biggest dealer in ho chi minh city ... and convinced him to , how do you say , to finger the cobra for us .
why do you call him that ?
they treat him like he' s a king .
king cobra .
they' re just kids , really .
some barely in their teens .
you cut off the head , the snake will die , believe me .
the dealer told us about a meeting between cobra and a new client .
we will be there to arrest him .
you take him out before that happens .
here in saigon ?
saigon ?
old habits die hard , huh ?
at one of the establishments the cobra owns .
club cong .
check this out .
this is very new .
i' m going to make the dealer put it on the cobra .
it' il send a signal to your trs computer .
that way it' il be easy to find him in the crowd .
by the way , how are your weapons ?
the aw magnum' s just fine .
where did you get that ?
fucking japanese .
pretty cool , huh ?
how close do i get to my target ?
300 meters , maybe .
outside , inside .
come on , eat up .
i think it' s best i show you .
how long have you been a policeman ?
six years .
when did the nsa recruit you ?
couple of years ago .
you see how it is ?
no better than before .
things need to change .
maybe you guys don' t fuck up like last time .
was your old man in the war ?
yes .
nva ?
my father was an american gl , ninth battalion , 25th lnfantry .
nobody here knows this .
he die here ?
went home to his real family somewhere in ohio .
there .
you see that roof ?
that' s club cong .
your target will be there tonight around 10 : 00 .
he usually sits at table on the upper deck .
will it be crowded ?
it usually is .
what about the street ?
he' s got to come and go .
the entrance is on the other side .
there' s no sniper angle .
after you take the shot , you abandon your weapon here ... and buy a ticket on tan son train .
it' il take you to the airport .
what about the cleanup ?
a new identification has been arranged .
the body will not be claimed .
police will be satisfied the cobra is dead and no one will know who he really was .
i will not see you after this .
that' s my cell phone number .
call only if you need something or if something is wrong .
and remember , one shot is probably all you get .
one shot is all i need .
everything is in place .
the op is on iine .
how' s beckett doing ?
our contact says he' s fine .
no hesitations ?
doesn' t seem so .
target ?
on the move as we speak .
his buyer has arrived .
so far , so good .
lf everything goes well , it' il be over in less than 10 hours .
from your lips to god' s ear .
' cause if it doesn' t , we' re all in deep shit .
it' s me .
thomas ?
yeah .
it' s 4 . ' 00 in the morning .
is something wrong ?
sydney , i' m sorry , i ....
you sound so distant .
where are you ?
about 30 years away .
thomas ?
i' m sorry , syd .
i' m sorry for waking you .
are you okay ?
i' m okay .
i just ....
i' ve been thinking about ... how you and neil are ....
you' re ... the closest thing i' ve ever had to a family .
and i know ... sometimes i ....
sometimes i forget how much that' s meant to me .
and i just wanted to ... make sure you knew .
we know , thomas .
are you sure you' re okay ?
yeah .
i' m okay .
look , i gotta go .
i' il tell you what .
i' il give you a call in a few days , after i get back .
you promise ?
i promise .
yeah .
you know i love you .
i love you .
me , too .
i can' t go through with this !
he' il know !
he knows everything !
i' il make sure he knows we busted you .
he' il never trust you again .
nobody is to know about this .
except you and me .
what the fuck is it ?
doesn' t matter .
just put this on the cobra .
this is crazy !
i' m a dead man if i do this .
you' re a dead man if you don' t .
any sign of tran yet ?
no .
not yet ...
let me know as soon as you do .
they' re here .
got him .
what the fuck are you looking at ?
where the hell is he ?
where the fuck you been ?
he' s like a fuckin ' turtle ...
fuck you .
you' re late .
we were about to leave .
they' re inside .
make your way to the roof .
he' s here .
bring ' em in .
the cobra' s here . ln the back , in the booths .
lf you don' t need me anymore i' m going to split .
what' s your hurry ?
i just thought i' d party , you know ...
you' re asking me to kiii the man who saved my iife .
what the hell' s he doing here ?
a lot of young men didn' t come back .
what' s the matter ?
you don' t look so good ...
i' m fine ...
who' s going to get me a drink here , girls ...
goddamn piece of shit .
what' s going on ?
do it .
shit .
how are we going to make the deal work for both ...
what did you do ?
nothing
what dld you do ?
nothin ' ... l swear ...
now !
forgive me .
damn .
got you , fucker .
you' re not that good a fucking shot , but you might get lucky .
what the hell happened ?
beckett missed the target .
but he took out our goddamn backup ?
we' re fucked , truly fucked .
where is he now ?
the vietnamese police have him .
it should be easy for our men to get to him , right ?
our contact is not trained for that .
then get someone who is .
i should be the one to talk to him !
let khan choi handle it .
he' s a bit more persuasive when it comes to things like this ...
talk to me .
i told you , my name is beckett .
thomas j. beckett .
and what are you doing here , thomas j. beckett ?
soaking up asian culture .
the man you killed on the roof , he was cambodian national .
maybe you two got something to do with what happened at club cong tonight .
club cong ?
look , i want to speak to the american consul .
sure .
you bet .
the national police have taken over the case .
you should have thought of that ... when you changed the plan and forgot to tell me about the secondary hit .
i' il see what i can do .
weird fucking world , ain' t it , tommy ?
finnegan ?
fucking weird .
after all these years , they send my old hump buddy beckett to do the job .
that was avery' s idea , wasn' t it ?
what happened ?
you could always make the million to one shot .
losing your touch , or change of heart ?
fucking avery lied to you .
that' s something the two of us have in common .
which lie ?
the one about you dealing drugs ?
or running weapons ?
or the jamaah lslamiyah ?
they know about that ?
why , finn ?
what other choice does a dead man have ?
i gave my life to serve god and country .
you' re a dealer in death .
whose god and country do you serve ?
the last thing i need is a sermon about death from an assassin .
i did the job they asked and they sold me out .
then why didn' t you come home when it ended ?
this is my home .
it was always my home .
i knew it the second we hit that lz in tay ninh .
after that first night , i knew i wasn' t going back , tommy .
i was alive here !
even in all the death , i was alive !
nothing ever made me feel like that back there .
nothing and no one .
some people are born for war .
this isn' t war , finn .
this is madness .
what about syd and neil ?
you know , your son just got married .
i delivered your note as promised .
they don' t exist .
they haven' t existed for over 30 years .
it was better that way .
for everyone .
someone tried to kill me after i took the shot .
you' re in it now .
you should have quit when you were ahead .
ln what ?
i can bury them , tommy , that' s what they' re afraid of .
you' re not the first one to come gunning .
they' ve been trying for years .
that' s why i stay in the ditch .
sorry you got yourself into this .
but then , you always were an idealist .
that' s what they counted on .
neil' s the one i feel sorry for .
he thinks he' s the son of a war hero .
every day , i watch this world descend into hell .
i' m just trying to find myself a nice comfortable seat with a good view .
somebody blew up the police station at ho chi minh .
what ?
listen to me , you iittle fuck , and don' t you say a word .
meet me at the people' s unification building in two hours .
you come alone ... or i' il tell the ho chi minh police who you really work for .
i didn' t know what they were gonna do .
they never ....
it was a game both sides played .
look , i didn' t know .
they never told me the hit on you was part of the operation .
i swear .
what happened to finnegan ?
they don' t know yet .
they' re still identifying bodies .
i' ve spent years trying to forget this shit .
you really think it was going to be that easy ?
you' re going to get me out of here .
and go where ?
you' re gonna get me another rifle and a sidearm .
and go where ?
lf he' s alive , he' s in the ditch .
hang on a sec , senator .
we had some people in phnom penh .
they should be in ho chi minh in less than an hour .
the bad news is that our boy' s gone awol .
what do you mean , awol ?
he hasn' t checked in .
what about finnegan and beckett ?
they' re still ld ing bodies , but neither of them are on the list so far .
i don' t fucking believe this .
i' m going to have to call you back .
no , it' s under control .
lf beckett is still alive , and he' s gotten to our boy ....
i know .
you and finnegan were friends ?
i mean , real good friends ?
yeah .
he saved my ass once .
this must be hard then .
he' s a bad guy .
i know .
how do you know he' s up in tay ninh ?
not in .
under .
when i knew finnegan , he was a tunnel rat .
everybody knows about them , and what they did .
yeah , well , they did what they had to do .
some say they like it .
you' re not supposed to like it .
what the fuck do you know about war ?
how can you be sure he' s there ?
because when i was in the jail , he slipped .
he mentioned something about " being in the ditch .
and that' s what the rats called the tunnels .
should we contact someone ?
someone you can trust ?
right now , i don' t trust anybody .
what the hell is that ?
police or nsa ?
nsa .
they' re in pursuit of the signal .
our boy' s headed towards tay ninh .
beckett' s with him .
he' s going after finnegan .
what the hell' s he doing here ?
say hello to stevie york .
we' re the 6 : 00 news .
some men came through here midday .
they headed into the jungle .
one was white .
he' s headed home .
you really expect to go in there by yourself and come out alive ?
no .
you' re going with me .
why would i want to do that ?
you wanted to know why they tried to kill me .
the answer' s in there with finnegan .
you see , there' s something he didn' t tell me .
the real reason they sent me .
and it was supposed to end with him ... and me .
where the hell did you dig this up ?
it' s my father' s .
it' s all he left behind .
i learned to shoot with it . ls it okay ?
best damn sniper rifle ever made , if you ask me .
you didn' t tell me your old man was a sniper .
you didn' t ask .
they' re around here somewhere .
it says they' re right here !
our cambodian units found the cell phone on the side of the road to tay ninh .
they must have figured out it was traceable .
not they .
beckett .
what do we do now ?
tell them to keep looking .
and pray that they find beckett before he finds finnegan .
it' s getting  hold it down .
we' re never going to find this place .
you okay ?
there' s more of them .
he' s dry .
get him !
he' s the last one .
he' il probably be heading for the tunnels .
there .
don' t do it .
he' s just a kid .
he was going to warn them .
right .
i know .
finnegan knows we' re here already .
it' s just a game to him .
we won the first round .
pass go , collect $200 .
now it' s our chance to spend it .
what ?
it' s a game .
you know , like mahjong ?
stay close to me and do as i say .
how do you know which way to go ?
i don' t .
great .
why not just yell out and tell them we' re here ?
how' re we going to see ?
no lights .
which way ?
what ?
i hear it .
sounds like music .
sounds like nwa .
what ?
nwa .
niggas with attitude .
you know , lce cube , dr. dre ?
the rappers .
sounds like fuck tha police .
what kind of idiots would write a song like that ?
you ought to try listening to a little bob seger .
what ?
couldn' t leave it alone ?
send some guys to take care of him .
you got yourself in some big trouble , boy ...
come on , policeman .
fight an ' die .
let him go .
he' s not part of this .
he is now .
you brought him along for a reason .
i' m thinking agency .
and maybe nsa .
i' m not gonna waste your time trying to justify myself , tommy .
we' re both killers .
different kinds .
when i kill a man , it' s because he needs killing .
i look at his life and if it adds up to nothing , i take him out .
but you , finn .
you got to liking it .
i never did .
so what' s this all about , finn ?
how does it all end here ?
it' s about stevie york .
you remember stevie , don' t you ?
say hello to stevie york .
what the hell' s he doing here ?
the ap photographer ?
it' s about stevie and me and avery .
and gaylor .
john gaylor , the senator ?
soon to be president , some say .
what about stevie york ?
he filmed it all .
we were higher than kites .
smoking and hunting for three days without sleep .
there was nine of them .
six men and three women .
when it was done , we started getting paranoid .
we' d make york destroy the film .
but as the days passed ...
gaylor and avery kept getting more and more psycho on me .
so we made a pact , the three of us .
and then we killed stevie and made it look like the nva did it .
so what now , tommy ?
what' s our next move ?
tell you what .
you could just walk out of here and go home .
lf i leave , the cop goes with me .
go , get out , beckett !
you know i can' t let that happen .
you' re going to have to kill me .
the only way i see it from here is to kill him .
what' s your old saying ?
one shot , one kill .
how about , one shot , two kills ?
a million to one .
lsn' t that what they used to say ?
do it .
they' re gonna kill me anyway .
he' s right , tommy .
take your best shot .
the digitorum tendon flexes and extends the finger .
time' s running out for one of us .
come on , tommy , make your move !
what' s happening here ?
they say you' re the mongoose .
come again ?
the mongoose .
it' s an old vietnamese folk tale .
when god created the cobra , he made him king .
as time passed , the cobra became so powerful he thought he was god .
so god created the mongoose to take his power away .
what do they want ?
whatever you want .
you have the power now .
you' re kidding me .
it' s true , i told you .
they' re just kids .
kids do anything .
listen to me .
there' s a colonel mckenna .
