<i>then i apply</ i> <i>an herb mint facial masque, </ i> <i>which i leave on for ten minutes</ i> <i>while i prepare the rest</ i> <i>of my routine . </ i>

but when <i>sports</ i> came out in ' 83 ,

the whole album has a clear , crisp sound , and a new sheen of consummate professionalism ... that really gives the songs a big boost .

he was part of that whole yale thing .
<i>" yale thing " ? </ i>

that " yale thing .
what kind of man was he , besides the information you' ve just given ?
i hope i' m not being cross examined here .
you feel like that ?
no , not really .
where did paul hang out ?

fluties , indochine ,
nell' s , the cornell club , <i>the new york yacht club . </ i>
he had a yacht ?
no , he just hung out there .
and where did he go to school ?

well , maybe he did , huh ?
his girlfriend doesn' t think so .
but has anyone seen him in london ?
actually , yes .
hmm .
<i>but i' ve had a hard time</ i> <i>getting actual verification . </ i>
a stephen hughes said he saw him at a restaurant there .
but i checked it out , and what happened is ... he mistook a herbert ainsworth for paul , so
had his apartment been burglarized ?
no , actually , it hadn' t .
toiletries were missing , a suit was gone , so was some luggage .
that' s it .
i mean , no one' s dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything , right ?
no , not yet .
as i said , we' re not sure .
basically , no one' s seen or heard anything .
so typical , isn' t it ?
<i>it' s just strange . </ i>
one day , someone' s walking around , going to work , alive , and then
nothing .

phil collins ] </ i>
do you like phil collins ?
<i>i' ve been a big genesis fan</ i> <i>ever since the release ... </ i> of their 1 980 album <i>duke . </ i>
before that , i really didn' t understand any of their work .
it was too artsy , too intellectual .
it was on <i>duke</ i> where ...
phil collins ' presence became more apparent .
i think <i>invisible touch</ i> is the group' s undisputed masterpiece .
it' s an epic meditation on intangibility .
at the same time , it deepens and enriches ... the meaning of the preceding three albums .
christie , take off the robe .
listen to the brilliant ensemble playing ... of banks , collins and rutherford .
you can practically hear every nuance of every instrument .
sabrina , remove your dress .
<i>in terms of</ i> <i>lyrical craftsmanship</ i> <i>and sheer songwriting, </ i> <i>this album hits a new peak</ i> <i>of professionalism . </ i>
sabrina , why don' t you , uh , dance a little .
<i>take the lyrics to</ i> <i>" land of confusion . " </ i>
<i>in this song, </ i> <i>phil collins ... </ i> addresses the problems of abusive political authority .
in too deep " is the most moving pop song of the 1 980s ... about monogamy and commitment . <i> [ continues ] </ i>
the song is extremely uplifting .
their lyrics are as positive and affirmative ... as , uh , anything i' ve heard in rock .
christie , get down on your knees ... <i>so sabrina can see your asshole . </ i>
<i>phil collins' solo career ... </ i> <i>seems to be more commercial, </ i> and therefore more satisfying in a narrower way , especially songs like " in the air tonight " and " against all odds .
sabrina , don' t just stare at it .
eat it .
<i>i also think that</ i> <i>phil collins works best ... </ i> <i>within the confines</ i> <i>of the group</ i> <i>than as a solo artist . </ i>
<i>and i stress the word " artist . " </ i>
<i> </ i> [ resumes ]
this is " sussudio .
a great , great song .
a personal favorite .  <i>there' s a girl</ i> <i>who' s been on my mind</ i> look at the camera . <i>all the time</ i>  <i>su sussuido</ i>  <i>oh , oh</ i>
<i>now , she don' t even</ i> <i>know my name</ i>  <i>but i think she likes me</ i> <i>just the same</ i>  <i>su sussuido</ i>  <i>oh , oh</ i>  <i>oh , if she' d call me</ i> <i>i' d be there</ i>  <i>i' d come running</ i>  <i>anywhere</ i> christie , look at the camera . <i>all of my life</ i>  <i>i feel so good</ i>  <i>if i just say the word</ i>  <i>su sussuido</ i>

we' re not through yet .
if they have a good personality and they' re not great looking , then who fucking cares ?
let' s just say hypothetically , okay ?
what if they have a good personality ?
i know .
i know .
there are no girls with good personalities .
a good personality consists of a chick with a little hard body ... who will satisfy all sexual demands ... without being too slutty about things ... and who will essentially keep her dumb fucking mouth shut .
the only girls with good personalities ... who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or talented though god knows what the fuck that means are ugly chicks .
absolutely .
<i>and this is because</ i> <i>they have to make up ... </ i> for how fucking unattractive they are .

when i see a pretty girl walking down the street , i think two things .
one part of me wants to take her out and talk to her , be real nice and sweet and treat her right .
and what did the other part of him think ?
what her head would look like on a stick .

excuse me .
nothing .
it' s good to see you .
is that edward towers ?
carnes , wait .
uh
davis , i' m not one to bad mouth anyone .
your joke was amusing .
but come on , man .
bateman is such a dork .
such a boring , spineless lightweight .
now , if you said bryce or mcdermott .
otherwise , it was amusing .
now , if you' il excuse me , i really must be going .
wait .
uh stop .
i did it , carnes .
i killed him .
i' m patrick bateman .
i chopped allen' s fucking head off .
the whole message i left on your machine was true .
excuse me .
i really must be going now .
no .
no , listen .

i' m not davis .
i' m patrick bateman .
we talk on the phone all the time .
don' t you recognize me ?
you' re my lawyer .
now , carnes , listen .
listen very , very carefully .
i killed paul allen , and i liked it .
i can' t make myself any clearer .
but that' s simply not possible .
and i don' t find this funny anymore .
it never was supposed to be .
why isn' t it possible ?
it' s just not .
why not , you stupid bastard ?
because i had dinner with paul allen ... twice in london just ten days ago .
no , you ... didn' t .
now , if you' il excuse me .
