he went there with nothing .
no job , no money , no visa ... and he' s a big success .
i don' t want to dance with a nun .

i wanted a spring wedding .
i was going to bake a mango cake .
you' il end up working in some restaurant .

maybe i' m better off staying here ...
and becoming a salaried man .
don' t even say that .
but i tell my students , " move your feet to the beat of your heart .
and my heart is telling me to go to america .
i dreamt of it my whole life .

it' s not that easy .
i don' t want it to be easy .
i just want my chance .
maybe i' m not good enough .
maybe all i can do is be a waiter , but i want my chance to find out .
isn' t that the american dream ?
you' re a fool .
do you know why they call it the american dream ?
because it only happens when you' re asleep .
next !
i' m here for the audition .
ramu gupta .

my mother comes from hyderabad .
my father wanted to marry a muslim girl , but his family wouldn' t let him .

it' s kind of an oriental cabana boy thing .
you' re unique , rammy .

i' m telling you .
i' m the star , like john travolta .
pulp fiction " travolta or " urban cowboy " travolta ?
grease " travolta .
how many lines do you have ?
i haven' t seen the script yet .
i know your lines , just like your lines in the restaurant .
would you like chutney with your chapatis or poppadums with your paneer ?
" do you want nachos with your big gulp ?
piss off , man .
oh , i' m sorry .
good for you , yaar .
come on , so tell us about it .

man in turban working in gas station .

clock' s ticking .
come on .
okey dokey pokey .
actors on the set .
walk away .
okay ?
grab that .
for a starring role , i don' t have a lot of lines .
what are you doing ?
giving mr. happy a shine .
he gets more screen time than your face does .
what ?
any sign of our mr. rammy ?
okay , now , no time for nerves .
you gotta get out there .
don' t you want to be in the movie ?
but a real movie , not ... pornography .
sugar , please .
everybody has to start somewhere .
so it' s one , two , and the inserts and we' re done .
there' s my jane .
now where' s my tarzan ?
hey , there' s the ram .
everyone meet rammy .
meet your co star sharrona .
hello .
all right , let' s rock .
come on .
welcome to fantasy island .
okay , rammy , you live on this desert island , obviously .
and you' ve basically been in the bushes beating your meat your whole life .
one day you' re skipping along the beach , you see this ... hot power suited mama , and you just wanna ...
teach her your native tongue .
hindi .
you' re the junior senator from wisconsin .
you' re investigating a nuclear dump site that' s contaminating the marine life .
okay , roll camera .
we are rolling .
action !
hello , i' m senator snatch .
i' m here on official government business .
are the natives here friendly ?
the natives here are restless , senator .
you look hot in that power suit .
i didn' t realise the tropics would be so warm .
the temperature isn' t the only thing here that' s up .
cut !
just tape it up .
it' il be fine .
brilliant .
nice moment , rammy , but we' re not doing this for lifetime .
okay ?
you see her , you screw her , we go home .
also , you' re happy skipping along the beach .
life is good .
skip .
screw .
happy .
got it .
guess who' s coming at dinner , take two .
hello , i' m senator snatch .
i' m here on a ...
rough stuff .
problem ?
we don' t have wood .
stand by .
holding on wood .
standing by for wood .
we are holding on wood !
do you have an erection problem ?
no , sir .
ask the makeup girl .
she' s a guy .
i' m more woman than you' il ever have , pencil dick .
sorry , dude .
get hard or get going .
it' s just sex , silly .
where' d you find this guy ?
he found me .
you know , we coulve had waldo .
no , waldo' s too hairy for this .
the natives don' t have a lot of back hair .
it' s just the idea of being naked in front of all these people .
well , the trick is not to be naked up here .
it' s like other actors get costumes , but we don' t , or at least not for very long .
so your naked body is really just your costume .
i promise , in india i' m a real stud .
if you and i could just go somewhere by ourselves ... without people watching .
there' s always someone watching .
dwain ?
god , silly .
god is watching us ?
yeah , but not for kicks .
i mean , the universe isn' t run by some big old perv .
what do you mean ?
i mean , the same god who made the rose and the ocean ... he made me .
and my body is made to have sex ... just like the rosebud is made to open .
wow .
we' re in .
places , please .
short five .
sorry .
the most powerful sexual organ god gave us is our brain .
think about it .
action !
okey dokey pokey .
cut !
what now ?
i can' t stop thinking about god .
and therefore i cannot achieve wood .
i see .
sharrona , you gotta help me out here , please ?
forget it , dwain .
if i' m late again meeting rusty ...
he' s gonna get suspicious .
doesn' t this guy ever go to a video store ?
hey , that' s good .
this' d be a great character for you .
we haven' t done a schoolteacher number in a while .
not since ...
the prime of miss jean' s booty .
see you .
please .
taxi !
taxi !
broadway and 86th .
i' m in a hurry .
sharrona !
guys , you seen miss lynell around ?
who ?
i' m telling you , bro , she' s definitely two timing you with the librarian .
why don' t we go to o' neill' s ?
we drown out your sorrows .
hey .
hey .
thanks , guys .
i' il catch you in the a . m . , randy .
not if i catch you first , firebug .
where you been , princess ?
one of the foreign students had a problem straightening out his grammar .
' bye , guys .
not a very friendly group .
they' re never nice to substitutes .
nice to see you , mr. and mrs. de borman .
service entrance is downstairs .
okay .
good evening , lloyd .
lars , your sister' s locked herself in the bathroom again .
please , get her now .
so , swami , you really see the future ?
a couple more of these and i do .
as many of you know , our birthday girl ... is on a little quest for spirituality .
om .
om .
lex ?
one more " om " and then you have to come to your party .
it always has to be what she wants , even on my birthday .
i wanted a tibetan gathering with a rinpoche ... but no , she does an indian feast with a ... ... world famous swami .
all those people care about is sex and money .
if they have money , they care about sex .
if they have sex , they care about money .
if they have both , they feel guilty and raise money for the opera .
more tandoori in the library .
swami , you' re on .
alexandra searched for so many years .
in the shoe department at bergdorf' s .
she has searched for the perfect diet , the perfect rock star boyfriend .
it seems lexi will search for anything except steady employment .
so , dear lexi , in honour of your current fixation ...
i give you swami bu .
swami bu has gone to another dimension .
i swear she was 16 .
mrs. von austerberg is going to kill me !
she paid a lot of money for a swami , and now we have no swami .
we have jack shit !
or we don' t have jack shit .
i don' t know which one it is !
what we do have is a drunk bastard .
you ...
didn' t i fire you ?
rasphal , i was just wondering about my job .
you really want your job back ?
mr. ramu " tom cruise " gupta ?
swami bu !
swami bu !
i' m conjuring up a swami .
here he is .
ladies and gentlemen , swami bu .
not long ago ... a wise man told me that all people care about is sex and money ... and opera .
now , myself , i don' t have any money ... well , because i' m a swami , and ... swamis don' t like opera , because ... well , you can' t dance to it .
so i will talk to you about sex .
what' d you pay for this ?
god , is it hot in here .
god .
god wants us to have sex .
and if god wants us to have sex , then , well , it can' t be bad ... because the universe isn' t run by a big old perv .
glad he cleared that up .
your naked body ... is like a costume that you wear to be yourself .
be comfortable ... in your nakedness .
the most powerful sexual organ god gave you ... is your brain .
think about it .
are you thinking ?
my whole body is about to think .
and like roses are made to open , so must you .
you must open your rosebud .
dance is like love .
join me .
follow your inner beat .
is he doing the macarena ?
looks like it .
wait , isn' t that the ...
i think it' s one of those dervish , spiritual , trance dance things .
excellent .
come on .
i thought we were just going to do some light chanting .
bravo .
the macarena , man .
shut up .
swami bu !
we' re going clubbing .
you want to come ?
unless it' s against your religion or something .
no , my religion believes in clubbing .
swami bu .
call me ramu .
candles .
we need candles .
you can' t have spiritual sex without candles .
you must use a lot of candles in india .
when the electricity goes out .
undress me slowly , spiritually ...
like a goddess .
pretend i' m vishnu .
vishnu is a man .
kali ?
kali is the goddess of death and destruction .
okay .
death and destruction .
music .
we need music .
not really , no .
this is perfect .
it' s the guatemalan boys choir .
they' re deaf .
i' m having sex with a guru .
chakh le .
it' s so powerful .
i can stand alone .
it feels like we' re doing it .
right now .
from there , it' s like ...
it feels like we' re doing it .
right now , from there , it' s like you' re pulsating through me .
it' s better from here .
trust me .
oh , guru , what is the most sacred position ?
you may find this hard to believe , but in india guru sex is very fast .
what about the slow chanting 200 position sex ?
that' s tibet .
where i come from , we do it very fast .
like wild monkeys at sundown .
and if we don' t , the evil spirits might grab our tails ... and throw us into the next jungle .
you know what ?
don' t get me started .
how you gonna teach kids values if you haven' t lived them yourself ?
will you hate me if i make you wait ?
no , i love you .
i' m proud to save myself for you .
you know what ?
you' re the best .
honey , can i ask you a question ?
how does a nice , catholic schoolgirl like you ...
learn how to make all those sexy little sounds ?
well , me and my friends used to practice kissing .
on our hands .
that' s silly .
the second half is starting .
remember when i had that thing with my african drumming teacher ?
i don' t know .
he just got really needy .
but this one is the real thing .
not a lot of people know about him yet .
it' s up to me to get his message out there .
anyway , he' s gonna be bigger than deepak chopra .
ramu is the guru of sex .
the guru of sex .
she really thinks you can be as famous as deepak chopra ?
who is he ?
does he dance ?
no , he tells americans how to get rich and be happy .
i thought they knew .
have you even tried the kama sutra ?
no , have you ?
a little .
by myself .
but , vijay , i don' t want to be a guru .
i want to be an actor .
then act like a guru .
it' s better than acting like a waiter .
so , who writes the lines for deepak chopra ?
they' re not lines .
he has a philosophy and shit .
these guru types don' t just put on turbans and screw chicks .
they say profound things they' ve been thinking about for centuries .
the point is the guy' s made a gazillion dollars .
a gazillion dollars ?
what' s that in rupees ?
i don' t think they have that many .
sex guru .
why didn' t i think of that ?
i want the suede , not the leather .
i want every colour .
no , i' m staying in town , so have them sent to new york .
okay .
i gotta go .
guru ramu .
thank you for gracing me with your presence .
champagne ?
i hope you don' t mind .
i invited amy to join us .
she' s a journalist .
a journalist ?
no .
so , as the son of the maharajah , when did you have your epiphany ?
when i was 15 .
tell us everything .
i' il touch yours , you touch mine .
no big deal .
do you know who or what you were in any of your previous incarnations ?
dessert ?
that' s me .
i was hoping to schedule a scrub .
it seems like you' re holding back , just a little .
what you said at my party was so much more powerful .
god , rosebud , the naked costume , and all that .
right .
you know , lexi , maybe i' m not the one to do all this .
wow .
alexandra , hi .
how' s your mother ?
remarkably lifelike .
guru ramu , kitty .
guru ?
does he do privates ?
does he ever .
tuesday ?
perfect .
heaven .
ciao .
you do privates , right ?
you' il get a call back .
adios , waldo .
great job today .
thanks .
hi .
it' s me .
rammy .
hello .
i just wanted to apologise for what happened on the set .
i got paid .
excuse me , sir .
watch it , pal .
i' m so sorry .
i' m so sorry .
pardon me .
excuse me , ma' am .
hello , again .
so now you' re stalking me ?
no , i was hoping perhaps i could buy you a cup of tea ?
i don' t do that .
perhaps coffee then .
look , rammy , i' m engaged to a nice , normal guy .
do you know how hard it is to find a nice , normal guy in the city ?
right ?
i just want your help with a professional problem .
would you stop worrying about it ?
a lot of guys can' t get it up .
you don' t understand .
people are telling me i could be the next deepak chopra .
well , i' m not familiar with deep pack .
i don' t watch dirty movies because my fiance' s kinda religious .
no , i have an opportunity to make a lot of money .
duh !
why do you think i got into this business , ' cause it was interesting ?
in three years i saved enough to buy a house in throg' s neck ... and pay for my whole wedding .
mulberry street .
do you want to see the cake ?
grazie , ciao .
hi , i' m sherri , i called earlier .
are you tony ?
yeah , i got everything over there .
that' s ...
expensive .
it' s $800 .
you see this one ?
this is more in your price range .
that' s very nice , too .
yeah .
actually , sir , we will order this one .
i want my lovely bride to be happy .
rammy , no .
now , you two kids discuss it amongst yourselves , okay ?
rammy , $800 is too much .
i can' t accept that .
look , it' s not a gift .
i want you to be my teacher and i' m happy to pay for this privilege .
okay .
yeah , come on in .
if this is a bad time i could come back later .
what am i doing here ?
isn' t this your apartment ?
what ?
yes , this is my apartment .
i mean , what am i doing letting you into my apartment ?
the other day ...
rusty , my boyfriend ... doesn' t know about my x rated job in the real world .
he thinks that i' m a pg 13 girl .
that i' m a nice , normal girl .
well , you are .
what ?
a nice , normal girl .
you think so ?
wait a second .
do not flirt with me .
do not .
that is rule number one .
okay ?
and no little gifts either .
you don' t try to hit on me or take advantage of any situation ... that you might find a turn on .
do you understand ?
this is just a lesson .
i am a teacher and you are the student .
of course .
so , no touchy feely .
if you touchy feely me , i will hurt you .
i will cause you pain .
i know the art of karate .
okay .
if we' re gonna do this , you have to promise me ... that everything i say stays in this room .
you can' t tell anyone .
not a single soul .
no , you see , you don' t understand ...
then you can leave right now .
but of course .
okay .
let' s get started .
so the other day , what happened ?
why did you lose it ?
i was afraid .
there were 20 people around , many drinking coffee , watching me .
exactly .
fear .
fear is cold .
it freezes us up .
fear of performance .
fear of doing something bad , something dirty .
what would our parents think ?
what do we think ?
do you know where we hold our fears ?
up here .
further south .
that' s why sex is such a release .
when we come , we let go of our fears .
and when we let go of our fears , we touch our soul .
so the way i look at it is ... my pussy is the door to my soul .
why are you afraid , kitty ?
well , what makes you think i' m afraid ?
i feel it .
please , close your eyes .
we have so many fears .
fear of performance .
fear of doing something bad .
fear of what people will think .
yes .
do you know where we hold our fears ?
between our eyebrows where we get those yucky little lines ?
in our genitals .
that is why sex is such a release .
when we come , we let go of our fears ... and when you let go of your fears , you touch your soul .
your pussy is the door to your soul .
so , if i touch myself here ...
kitty ?
... i won' t be afraid ?
excuse me .
how much do i owe you ?
what you wish .
i' m sorry .
i need to be by myself .
lexi , he is beyond insightful .
i have to go .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
nice to meet you .
wow .
she paid me .
you' re incredible .
kitty' s such an unhappy person and you helped her so much .
just think , there are so many unhappy people out there .
i know most of them .
but we can help them together .
i really want to do that .
i' ve never ... really done anything , you know .
can we do that ?
can we ... help mankind ?
i really want to help mankind .
cool .
vljay : $2, 000 !
it' s bloody incredible .
but it' s not my wisdom , it' s sharrona' s .
she thinks she gives me lessons to be in porno movies ... and she made me promise not to tell anyone .
great .
vij , be serious .
i am , yaar .
get her wisdom and use it .
don' t you want to be a star ?
well , yes ...
how do you think that' s going to happen if you' re not a guru ?
name one indian star in america .
name one .
that guy from the simpsons .
he' s a cartoon .
don' t you guys have to be at the restaurant ?
ramu' s got a new job .
you gonna be a cab driver ?
no , i' m going to be a guru .
cheers , guruji .
vij !
come on , you want to get comfortable in your naked costume , don' t you ?
you need to be comfortable with your own body .
okey dokey pokey .
great .
your nakedness .
say that five times .
i' m a good lover .
and again .
i' m a good lover .
i deserve pleasure .
the maharaj of beer .
next .
you two are gonna have a wonderful weekend .
i' m a good lover .
thank you .
that was very good .
that was very good .
stop .
guru , my brother golfs with the maharajah of jaipur , bubbles .
and he says he' s never heard of you .
well , it' s a big country .
gurus shun the life of wealth and materialism .
swami muktananda said everything in the universe ... is made of divine consciousness ... and its innermost form dwells in the centre of us all .
wow , that' s good .
lexi , can i see you in the kitchen ?
do you know where it is ?
so , guru ... what would you tell a couple that has hit a wall ?
are you all right ?
can i get you a doctor ?
what in heaven' s name are you doing ?
being happy for a change .
freely expressing my sexuality .
you are sucking face with your yoga instructor .
he' s not my yoga instructor .
and so what if i am ?
darling ... we don' t date the help .
remember what happened with aunt eujanie and that u. p. s. man ?
news flash , mother , all people of colour aren' t here to serve you .
how dare you say that !
i have served meals to the homeless .
good meals .
things i' d eat myself , if i still ate carbs .
at any rate , you are making our guests feel very uncomfortable .
they' il get over it .
you' re drinking too much .
darling , come join .
hi .
yes .
thank you very much .
can you feel it in your mouth ?
can you taste it ?
the taste is sweet .
the taste is ...
mint chocolate chip .
okay , you can open your eyes now .
i got that from an acting class .
it helps when you don' t click with someone .
remember that we have five senses ... and using them can make anything sexy .
so , why do you do these movies ?
if you' re having doubts about the business then you should quit now .
trust me .
you like to cook .
in india , we call that a homely girl .
you know , a girl who likes to do things in the home .
yeah , that' s me , homely girl .
can i taste ?
cinnamon ?
hey , that' s lamb stew .
yeah , so ?
it has no flavour .
come on ... taste .
are you flirting with me ?
no .
no .
got you .
don' t take everything so seriously .
all right , that' s it for today .
okay .
and , rammy ...
i use mint chocolate chip , too .
edwin , is that you ?
what' s wrong ?
you haven' t been up here since the reagan administration .
it' s bush time .
and tell josh that a lot of agents want to sign him .
lexi .
we met at dr. sis retreat for neurotic compulsives .
i' m not supposed to say that .
lexi who wouldn' t go to the oscars with him .
don' t say that .
just tell him lexi , okay ?
he' il know who i am .
ciao .
get up , we have the trainer at 10 : 00 a . m .
10 : 00 a . m . ?
i have to go .
i have an appointment .
but i planned my day around you .
i was going to buy you sweaters .
i' m sorry , lexi , but i have my own life , too .
you can' t do this to me .
you can' t just go and not tell me where .
guru !
i have abandonment issues !
okay , now i' m going to tell you something i' ve never told anyone ... but it' s helped me more than anything .
i can' t even believe i' m telling you this .
you don' t have to tell me if you don' t want .
no , i want to .
okay , one of the biggest problems ... is making something mechanical look romantic .
so music can help .
i love music .
me , too .
what i do is , i hear and i feel the music ... in my body .
what music ?
songs , romantic songs .
like , i let it sing ... and then the rest of me follows .
i' il show you .
name a song .
la bamba .
that doesn' t work .
it has to be romantic .
it has to send love through your loins .
don' t go changing to try and please me
you never let me down before
did you see what i was doing ?
yeah .
it' s like , on certain words the passion comes through my body .
it' s like i can actually feel billy joel between my legs .
not billy joel the person ... but the romance , the sweetness , the intention of his words .
now you try it .
don' t go changing to try and please me
don' t try to make a point , try to touch your soul .
i' il do it with you .
you never let me down before
i don' t imagine you' re too familiar
why don' t you get on top of me ?
it' s the only way you' il learn .
what ?
sorry .
don' t go trying some new fashion
don' t change the colour of your hair
i don' t want clever conversation
i never want to work that hard
i just want someone
i can talk to
i want you just the way you are

what' s up ?
" ramew gouda .
hey , you made it .
i' m so psyched for this .
josh , ramu .
it' s nice to meet you .
may i take your coat ?
no , i' m fine .
oh , no , please , i' il just hang it ...
i was at a past life workshop .
really ?
did you see me ?
i worked in the mailroom .
just kidding .
why don' t you have a seat ?
lexi tells me you have quite the following .
i' m just gonna jump right in , okay ?
the goal here is to separate you from all the other self help spiritual types ... so you' re not just another indian , or , excuse me , native american .
what you' ve got going for you is god .
and by the way , god is big .
you mention god , people pay attention .
god demands attention , and ...
what can i say ?
we want to be in bed with god .
but what do people want to pay attention to more than anything else ?
sex .
you let people think about both , which is brilliant .
josh is one of the smartest agents in town .
we can handle your book deals in london , website in munich ...
your television in new york .
television ?
that' s right .
movie deals in hollywood .
hollywood ?
sure .
step one , you gotta expand your core audience .
how do we do that ?
i think we do a big show , a couple thousand people .
maybe we book a broadway house .
broadway ?
the guru of sex . " one night only .
you gotta keep them wanting more .
hey , ari , get me the playhouse .
and , by the way , i' m not into micromanaging ... but you' re not going to wear that ...
what is it you' re wearing , anyway ?
i really like josh .
what' s going on ?
what do you mean ?
you run to secret appointments ...
to past life workshops with costumes .
i' m sorry ...
you don' t invite me , when you know how much i love that stuff .
i couldn' t , i ...
you' il be the mother teresa of sex .
i want to help you , and you leave me out .
i don' t understand that .
no one can give you what you want .
it' s too much .
what are you saying ?
i' m saying live your own life , not mine .
follow your own dreams , not mine .
there are many different paths .
you can go this way , or that way .
but you must choose your own path .
it' s your own damn journey .
i' m going to meditate on that !
yeah .
hello .
thank you .
' bye .
ramu .
what more could a swami ask for ?
hey !
hey .
hey .
i got an idea for today' s lesson , but ...
no .
it' s such a beautiful day .
let' s take a walk .
okay .
after you .
so , i miss my nanima the most .
does your family like it you' re in america ?
no , they' d rather i be married off with kids ... holding down a nine to five salary .
but they' re getting used to it .
they want me to be happy .
you' re lucky , ' cause the only family i have right now is dwain and peaches .
they' re quite a family .
no , really , they saved my life .
i don' t even want to tell you what i was doing before i met them .
they treat me right .
i' m safe with them .
look , sharrona ...
i have to tell you something .
go on .
this is really difficult .
let me tell you something first .
i really like teaching you .
it makes me feel good to help someone .
but i don' t think you should do it .
you don' t know what it' s like .
it' s porn ...
i just don' t think you should do it .
you' re so pure and good and ...
you don' t know what it' s really like .
that' s why i made up all those ways to get through it .
because i wanted to make it seem like i was doing something else .
something important and respectable .
you are respectable .
how can you say that ?
rusty doesn' t even know what i do .
if he did , he wouldn' t marry me .
but i' d marry you ... ... for 50 cows .
only 50 ?
well , they' re sacred you know .
okay , 100 sacred cows , and ...
a herd full of blue elephants .
blue ?
blue .
i have to go .
no , you don' t have to do anything .
of course i do , silly .
see you .
but , hey , that' s randy for you .
he' s so funny .
you always say that .
to sherri and rusty .
russell tells me you' il help teach the catechism class .
catechism .
neat .
it' s a blessing to have a professional in charge at last .
hi , baby .
father feels you' re an amateur .
leave mum alone .
i said no such thing .
tuesdays is knitting circle , and you will be the first member of the millennium .
i had to use all my influence .
if it doesn' t interfere with couples ' bowling , right , honey ?
you ever bowl with rusty ?
it' s a good thing .
throws the ball like a ballet dancer .
don' t start , dad .
tell me , my dear , have we not met before ?
sweetie , have you met father flanagan before ?
no , father , i would have remembered meeting you .
your lovely face looks so familiar to me .
you don' t believe me ?
watch and learn , tough guy .
you' re the chick from star whores , right ?
episode 69 ?
excuse me ?
no , that' s not me .
no , it' s you .
i saw that forwards and backwards .
you' re out of line .
sit down .
you' re making a mistake .
it' s her .
baby .
what' s he doing ?
you know what ?
i' m sick of this .
there must be some cheap porn star out there that looks just like sherri .
i' m sorry , honey .
i' m feeling a bit sick ...
sweetheart , wait ...
i have to go home .
honey ?
what did i say ?
pre wedding jitters .
hello , is rammy there ?
ramu ?
no .
can you tell me where he is ?
the broadway playhouse .
thank you .
now that you have an agent , i think you need a manager .
what do managers do ?
take 15 percent .
guru ramu and friend .
hey , lex .
well , hello .
vijay rao , manager .
guru , i' ve been meditating on what you said ... and i think i understand why you pulled back from our relationship .
i don' t .
the reason you ignited my kundalini energy in the first place ... was so i could move that sex force into other chakras ... my heart , my mind , maybe even some day , my third eye .
exactly .
yes , i knew it .
i knew giving up the stuff would help me focus .
what stuff ?
everything .
i' m moving to a studio apartment in queens .
will you be subleasing your penthouse ?
that' s right .
feel it .
yes , let it sing .
feel billy joel between your legs .
and then , feel your genitals come alive .
some want to sing in harmony .
that is okay .
and i don' t see you anymore
don' t go trying some new fashion
don' t change the colour of your hair
that' s right .
send that love through your loins .
feel it .
that' s it .
unspoken passion
genitals are the gateway to your soul .
let them sing .
although i might not seem to care
let go of your fears .
fear is cold .
i don' t want clever
cold freezes .
when we make love ...
conversation
we release our fears and we ...
i never want to work that hard
touch our souls .
that i can talk to
i want you just the way you are
sharrona , wait !
carry on , the guru' s just gone to the restroom .
i need to know that you will always be
remember , sex is good for you .
the same old someone that i knew
love your loins .
i meant to tell you .
you certainly had a deal , didn' t you ?
you pay me , steal my private thoughts , and sell them to the world .
i told you things i have never told anyone .
i tried to tell you , i did .
and then i wanted your philosophy , and then i wanted to see you .
that is why .
i just wanted to see you .
you' re sick , you know .
and mean .
how could you lie like that ?
you tell me , mrs. schoolteacher .
what about rusty ?
you' re lying to him and to yourself .
that' s not true !
you think no one will love you for you , so you pretend to be someone else .
don' t you see ?
that is not real .
what is that ?
guru speak ?
it' s true .
maybe i' m a bad person who deserves to be stabbed in the heart ... but i know you deserve more .
you' re just a stupid con man .
go steal those people' s money ... before they realise that you' re just a big dumb fake !
i' m a fake ?
well , then you' re a super fake .
a porno star saying you' re a teacher , for a house in frog' s neck !
throg' s neck .
i plan to be very happy there .
you better go steal those people' s money before your visa expires !
okay , i will !
taxi !
i' il be rich , and famous , and very , very happy !
fine !
fine !
taxi !
hello , girls , come on .

they can carry us out of here in a box .
anthony , i' m waiting for you !
all right !
we got it .
ten cents for every guru of sex t shirt sold .
maybe we could donate the proceeds .
maybe .

you smell like a bombay hooker .
ramu , we' ve got the cher party tonight .

i' m so sorry .

she' s just a nervous bride .
i' il get my purse .
i won' t be a jiffy .
it' s terrible what i did to you .
i know that .
but what you' re about to do ...
don' t go through with this .
you don' t have to .
you and me ...
there is no you and me .
you used me .
and i used you , too .
and i did it for the cake .
here you are , sir .
good bye .
and thank you .
all righty , then .
vij , i can' t go in there .
what the fuck you talking about ?
i know you love it .
the clothes and everything ... but it' s not real .
i can' t do this anymore .
you' re serious .
but , ram , you' ve made it .
you' re a star .
i don' t care .
of course you do .
remember , yaar , we came here with nothing .
and look at us now .
you' ve made it for all of us .
think about your family , how proud they' il be .
come on , yaar .
hey , is that him ?
oh , it' s him .
it' s guru .
right this way .
okay , i' m your cousin kimberly .
i' m a librarian , and i have five children , all boys .
i like that part .
and , i live in utica .
ithaca .
you live in lthaca .
and you run a head start program there .
okay .
head .
head , i can remember that .
i' m cutting the cake , not jumping out of it .
okay .
honey , what' s wrong ?
why are you crying ?
i don' t know .
oh , honey .
they' re just tears of joy or something .
honey , no .
no , the makeup .
waldo hernandez .
waldo .
and what do you do ?
i' m in the meat packing industry .
hi .
pretend i' m not here .
marsha !
and now i' m happy to introduce a true phenomenon ... the guru of sex , ramu gupta .
ramu gupta will be taking calls , and he will be talking about ... well , what he talks about , sexual intercourse .
mama !
ramu' s on sally jessy raphael .
well , first i' d just like to say hi to my family .
hi , nanima .
he said hi to me .
what' s he doing ?
he' s talking about sexual intercourse .
what ?
candy , make sure everything is in tiptop shape .
oh , yes .
mrs. von austerberg is very demanding .
yes , i know .
so am i.
welcome back .
the guru of sex ...
ramu gupta .
look , it' s our guru .
our next question is from ...
john .
guru , my problem is that the only way i' ve been ... able to get a woman is on the computer .
well , john , don' t limit yourself .
maybe sometimes on the computer , other times on the bed .
don' t be afraid to try new things , huh ?
next , we have a caller from alaska .
go ahead , caller .
yes , hi .
i' m supposed to get married .
congratulations .
yeah , but the problem is the girl i' m marrying .
she' s awesome , but i don' t really love her .
does your fiancee know how you feel ?
no , she has no idea .
and i know it would kill her .
well , alaska ...
come on ! ... the best advice i can give you is ... to move your feet to the beat of your heart .
but my heart beats for the second hoseman on my truck .
then you must go to the hoseman , alaska .
you must go to the hoseman .
he doesn' t seem himself .
i feel sorry for the girl marrying the homo .
it' s quite a responsibility being a spiritual guru , isn' t it ?
yeah , it is .
but there is something i have to say .
i am not a guru .
what ?
there goes the book deal .
all i' ve ever done is ... is to teach dance .
what ?
i tried to act .
i came to america to be in movies ... well , to be on tv .
but i' m a fake .
i have betrayed you all and ...
i am sorry , i ...
i have to go .
all your wisdom ...
it was just an act .
but , i gave up all my stuff .
i am sorry .
i' m a fake .
what does that make me ?
i now have all these ideas , and they came from me ... not from vanity fair or my mother .
how can you say that' s fake ?
it' s not .
no , i didn' t change you .
the guru you saw in me was the guru in you .
in your lie i found my truth .
come on , vij .
thanks our lexi .
what are we doing ?
where are we going ?
to get the woman i love .
hey , can you get to the bronx in 15 minutes ?
i' m a cab driver .
i can get to bombay in 15 minutes .
i' m so proud of you .
this whole thing has made me want to go back to documentaries .
she' s marrying someone else .
you can' t interrupt a wedding and take the bride .
sure i can .
haven' t you seen any american movies ?
it happens here all the time .
about fucking time , man .
don' t speak to me like that .
come on .
just don' t forget , i' m the one doing you a favour .
right .
dearly beloved , we are gathered here in the sight of god ... to witness the sacrament of marriage .
it was your stupid idea .
vij , you' re a real bastard .
rammy .
is that your plumber ?
carry on .
thank you .
... should not be joined together in holy matrimony speak now ... or forever hold your peace .
i do .
randy .
who are they ?
the new village people ?
you first .
you first .
no , you first .
no , you first .
i insist .
come on , man .
if you please , i am trying to conduct a wedding ceremony here .
but i thought you said we could speak now .
it was merely an expression as in " get lost . " please leave .
i can' t leave .
because if i leave ...
i leave everything that matters to me .
sharrona , you have taught me so much about so many things ... but right now i know something you don' t .
this is just a dream .
maybe you' ve had it for so long you think it has to become real ... but it doesn' t .
we live , and life brings us new dreams .
better ones .
ones that come from the heart , and not from the mind .
dreams that you cannot predict ...
like you .
that is why i cannot leave ... because my heart beats for that lady up there .
and i am not leaving here until i find out if her heart beats for me .
well , sherri ?
yes , my heart beats for you .
thanks the indian fella couldn' t get it up .
i thought you said he was native american .
yeah .
and you , young man .
why are you here ?
i agree with him .
well , proceed .
i' m not paid by the hour .
rusty .
my heart beats for rusty .
thanks good .
get that .
i' m on it .
good angle for her .
russell , we always knew you swam upstream .
amen .
come here , baby .
there' s a market for this .
yeah .
my little firebug .
there you go , ma' am .
peg , get over it .
well , enough of this swapping of spit .
let' s celebrate !
yeah !
