want me to tell you something ?
millions of celestial bodies are hurtling toward earth as we speak .
meteors and asteroids .
heading for earth .
straight toward us .
and they' re dangerous .
most of them burn up on their way through the atmosphere .
but meteorites don' t burn up .
on the surface , everything might seem fine .
then it happens .
out of the blue .
if a meteorite the size of a house strikes us ...
all life will be extinguished .
birger larsen ?
it' s happened before , and not very long ago .
just think of the dinosaurs .
bang !
game over .
we said 20, 000 , right ?
sure they' re legal ?
of course .
these are the world' s greatest fireworks .
they' re about to send up a satellite that will spot dangerous meteorites .
if one' s about to hit us , they can fire a nuclear missile .
that will divert the meteorite .
and it will crash somewhere else .
like mars .
we can' t save all the planets .
a couple , maybe .
like earth .

1 . 6 million goes to four lucky winners who picked number 11 .

you haven' t even opened it .
i' m saving it for christmas eve .
that' s not funny .
hi .
is this awkward for you ?

remember this ?
christmas ... 1988 .
maybe we should move .
to a house .
a house in the country .
with cows .
and maybe a little dog .
nah .
easy .
there you go , otto .
otto ?

yes .
good night .
good night .
december 23
will you be late this evening ?
no .
it' s ok with me .
you know that .
it' s ruined .
someone smashed alf' s flowers .
what were they ?
tulips ?
daisies ?
what were they going to be ?
na ...
na ...
nadia .
we can fix this .
and you had spent so much time on these .
made little plastic tents ...
it was juni !
no way .
wow !
did you see that beautiful white bird ?
it wasn' t her fault .
it was mine !
stand over there .
do you have a referral ?
the hospital refused to take him .
no , no ...
juni !
he wants to sleep with me .
no , i don' t think he does .
he says he doesn' t like girls .
juni !
johannes , he' s gay !
he says he' s a homosexual .
crazy ?
no .
just afraid .
bring him to the hospital .
they won' t take him .
usually in situations like this ...
does he have family ?
if not , it' s up to his doctor .
that would be me .
he should be deported .
we can' t even understand him .
he spoke norwegian yesterday .
shock is a good diagnosis .
and if he really is ill ?
then he has to stay , right ?
it is christmas , after all .
yes .
it is christmas .
i' il be back in a minute .
she didn' t mean anything by it .
she was just afraid .
sorry .
my fault .
one day this ball will go through the wall .
then everything will be in harmony .
and there will be nothing to be afraid of .
a huge meteor could crash right through here .
and nothing would happen .
no one would get hurt .
it' s not very likely , but ... you can always hope .
maybe i should go in to her ?
really ?
i agree .
it was my fault .
i shouldn' t have left you yesterday .
it' s so hard to get rid of yourself .
maybe you should wait .
it' s better during the summer .
more practical .
summer' s so far off .
no .
would you help me ?
please ?
there' s nothing to be afraid of .
want me to comfort you ?
i don' t need to touch you .
just comfort you with ...
with words .
horses grazing at night ...
we have to do something , mrs. ruud .
he' s fine .
he just needs something to drink .
let me call the nursing home .
then you won' t have any worries .
will they take otto ?
your bed is waiting .
the nurses are looking forward to your arrival .
nurses ?
is reidar in on this ?
i have spoken with him .
i see .
i' il be back tomorrow , and we can pack .
bye .
here' s your medicine .
he needs help .
no doubt about that .
thank you .
psychotic ?
paranoid ?
borderline ?
manic depressive ?
i think you should be manic depressive .
just make your face expressionless .
that' s it .
if he' s too normal , they' il send him back to burma .
manic depressive .
i' il be back soon .
are you ok ?
sit on each side , and make sure that juni doesn' t get by you .
no problem .
not while i' m here .
faggot .
no , i' m not .
bye .
it' s me .
you' ve been plotting against me .
you should be ashamed of yourself !
against your own mother ?
i don' t want to hear it !
not another word !
i often need to have things spelled out .
could you please do that now ?
it' s your christmas present .
that' s two days off .
what ?
christmas .
i don' t have time to wait .
best to get it over with .
i' m sorry .

birger ?
his name isn' t birger , you idiot !
birger ...
birger ?
birger ?
his name isn' t birger !
birger .
birger .
you said it was legal to sell fireworks from a gas station !
i want my money back !
that was my life savings .
i' il get it to you tomorrow .
i need that money now .
i have it .
then why don' t i have it ?
you' il get it .
consider it a long term investment .
hi .

yes .
lucky it' s my turn .
going to a party ?
i' m going to the canary islands .
my name' s thomas .
are you all right ?
nice house .
kind of art deco , isn' t it ?
please don' t touch anything .
worried someone might come home ?
they won' t be home until christmas eve .
who ?
mom and dad .
i was worried you were married .
mom' s side .
dad' s side .
ok ...
do you need help ?
aren' t you going to take your clothes off ?
you have to .
i' il just drop them on the floor .
it' il be over soon .
no one needs to know .
say that .
say it !
say , " we don' t have to tell anyone .
this is too weird .
was your name juni ?
shit !
is everything ok ?
juni ?
juni .
i got a new dress .
because they love me more than the heavens and the earth .
but ...
juni ...
juni ?
juni !
juni ?
she was totally insane .
i just followed her inside to get paid .
and she whacked me with a lamp .
you hadn' t done anything ?
not a thing !
and look at me now !
so what ?
i can' t do this today .
are you spying on someone ?
is that what you' re up to ?
no .
how' s your dog ?
fine .
do you have a problem ?
no .
maybe you have a serious problem .
i' il spare you the entire story .
thank you .
is this your car ?
are you drunk ?
my dear mrs. ruud ...
so , you know who i am .
and i know who you are .
a nurse .
psychiatrist .
same difference .
now i know how you get us committed .
you spy on us !
give me your keys , before i call the police !
get him , otto !
get him !
damn peeping tom .
get him , otto !
careful .
johannes ...
i' il go with her to the hospital .
they' re all after me !
everyone ?
hear that ?
did you call for that ambulance ?
christmas eve
merry christmas .
merry christmas .
merry christmas .
merry christmas .
he' s gay .
hi .
did you have a nice ambulance ride ?
good food ?
what did you get ?
rice porridge .
so did we .
with juice ?
were they angry ?
no .
well , maybe the guy who had to clean up ...
reidar ?
if i really want to ...
if it' s what i really want ...
don' t you want to wait ?
will you help me ?
please ?
can' t you just wait ?
please .
smart doggy .
good doggy .
she thought we wanted to go to some nursing home .
but we don' t want that , do we ?
she thought she was so smart .
mrs. ruud ?
that won' t help .
it doesn' t help to have an education .
mrs. ruud ?
you rest here , and i' il get us some food .
no one will find us in here , otto .
crazy ?
i may not be perfect ,
but i know the difference between a manic depressive and ...
sorry , my fault .
hi .
hi .
reidar' s mom , mrs. ruud , is missing .
is she here ?
no .
you didn' t come home last night .
i tried calling .
will you be home soon ?
no .
you can' t run this hospital on your own .
no .
it' s christmas eve .
yes .
but i have to stay in case something happens to juni .
how is she ?
she' s ... fine , i guess .
johannes ...
something bad happened .
something bad ?
she had sex with a stranger .
you think you can handle it , but you can' t .
do you think it will work out ?
no .
if i said that ... ... that nothing ever happened .
maybe we could put it behind us ?
no , we' ve ...
it' s gone too far .
this is what you wanted , wasn' t it ?
you should have stopped me , johannes .
i love you .
it doesn' t happen often .
but we can always hope .
you just have to be in the right place at the right time .
when everything is just right .
when the quarks in the ball match the quarks in the wall ,
the quarks in the ball will sneak past the quarks in the wall .
without colliding .
there will be a moment of harmony , when everything is in balance .
you just have to be there at the right moment .
it might be right now .
kierkegaard .
have you read any kierkegaard ?
i used to read him .
obsessive behavior is not unusual .
some people just get more out of it than others .
you' il find a solution .
but i can' t stay here any longer .
i didn' t realize how difficult it was to be insane .
too bad .
there' s just something missing in your eyes .
it' s good you have an umbrella .
mom ...
she thinks of everything .
merry ...
christmas .
i want my money back , thank you .
you' re welcome !
hey !
i know .
the rent .
you' il get it tomorrow .
pedigree !
that' s it , otto .
it may not look like it , but this is my money .
i don' t trust the bank , and i had forgotten my key .
it' s mine .
i know who you are .
please .
i know where you live .
please , don' t ...
could you help me ?
i need some dog food .
do you know where i live ?
automatic .
nice .
good to have .
you can' t do it here .
this place is full of doctors .
you aren' t trying to stop me again ?
no .
are you sure ?
yes .
don' t you dare try !
hi .
out for a walk ?
typical .
going to your sister' s ?
i' ve always wanted to go somewhere .
see other cultures .
a place like london .
penny lane and those other streets .
stop !
no , please .
those two people are nuts .
hi .
recognize me ?
we' d be happy to drive you home .
juni !
hello ?
juni ?
you' re freezing to death .
come with me .
come on , we can drive you .
sorry .
my fault .
i should have told you she' s a hitter .
it' s pathological .
ask her where she' s going .
where are you going ?
home .
fine .
we' il drive you home .
is everyone ok ?
want me to tell you something ?
millions of celestial bodies are hurtling towards earth .
straight toward us .
they' re dangerous .
some of them don' t burn up in the atmosphere .
some make it through , and strike us .
it' s happened before .
those meteors don' t care if it' s christmas eve .
they' il just make it worse for you .
i' il have to shut down .
i only have fire insurance , not burglary insurance .
do you have a light ?
they' re about to send up a satellite that can spot incoming meteors .
if they spot one , they can fire a nuclear missile .
that will divert the meteorite .
everyone lives somewhere .
then it will crash somewhere else .
like mars .
we can' t save all the planets .
maybe none .
i hope they send up that satellite soon .
we may run out of time .
watch out !
ok ?
come on out .
careful .
watch out , reidar .
mom ?
otto ?
i can' t feel my legs !
where are you , otto ?
look .
that means someone just died .
no , it means you can make a wish .
he needs help .
come on .
juni .
juni ...
i' ve seen it on tv .
this is how they do it .
then they are reborn .
i just wish someone had understood his final words .
maybe he said something to his parents .
i understood some of it .
really ?
he was talking fast , and in a foreign language , but ...
what did he say ?
he said you shouldn' t take those pills .
really ?
and that everything would be better now .
things are going to get much better .
really ?
we should set him on fire .
maybe that' s not necessary .
no .
i think maybe i' m a little cold .
juni ?
may i touch you ?
i' m a hitter .
that' s all right .
ok .
no problem .
i' m all right .
is this where you' ve been hiding ?
let' s sit here and rest for a while , otto .
life lasts but a brief second
one filled with both good and bad
i have fire insurance .
these are the world' s greatest fireworks !
are you ok ?
life lasts but a brief second
one filled with both good and bad
if you believe or hope you will be disappointed
life' s hands keep turning you meet and break apart
first a light and happy game
then you part and go your opposite ways
i have left you now
although i still love you
that' s why i tell you
you may forget , but i remember every word
everything broke , but no trace was left behind
at least i have the memories
they can never take them away from me
remember the joys we found together ?
remember the thoughts which bound us together ?
every day , every hour i have counted
if you forget , i will remember it all
nick norris
