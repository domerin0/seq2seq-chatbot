and already the temperature has reached ... ... a massive 92 degrees as this unprecedented heat wave continues .
clear skies in raccoon city and a light breeze coming in from the west .
and as a special bonus just for you , we have a pollen count of 0 .

that' s a record low for this time of year .
good news for all you hay fever and asthma sufferers .

we' ve received reports of umbrella corporation ... ... dispatching armed guards and troop carriers .
move in an orderly fashion to security checkpoints .
the city is completely contained .
troops have sealed all exits .
the only way out is this bridge .
all citizens must pass through medical scanning .

you better take a look at this .
family members must pass through security checkpoints together .
please proceed in an orderly fashion .

our men are still out there ...
just do it .
oh , my god , they' re closing the gates !
this is a biohazard quarantine area .
due to risk of infection , you cannot be allowed to leave the city .
what the fuck is going on here ?
all appropriate measures are being taken .
the situation is under control .
please return to your homes .
you won' t get away with this !
let us out !

kilo and romeo squads , rendezvous at sector 01 ... ... and secure against enemy .
grenade !
grenade !
squads three to seven are on full retreat .
no , sir .
suppression measures have failed .
we can' t contain it .
the infection is spreading faster than anyone anticipated .
dr. ashford .
shouldn' t you be on the chopper ?
i' m not going .
i was instructed to get you and the other scientists out of the hot zone .
you' re too important to umbrella to be at risk .
i' m not leaving without my daughter .
i' m sorry , truly .
but the city is sealed .
she may have survived the crash , but we couldn' t find her anywhere .
even if she were still alive , i couldn' t let her out .
the risk of infection is too great .
you must understand .
you do what you have to do .
i' m staying .
there has to be someone left alive .
come on .
matt !
take her to the raccoon city facility .
i want her quarantined .
close observation .
prepare her for exposure .
up the dosage .
just do it .
inside .
let' s get under cover .
you have to get out .
this is my place .
i' m hiding here .
it' s big enough for all of us .
don' t tell me ...
okay , just cool it .
put the gun down .
put the gun down .
and , you , take it easy .
so does the raccoon city police department ... ... have any comment on what those things are ?
what' s that you got there ?
my emmy .
that' s if any of us make it out .
are you all right ?
what are you doing ?
what' s wrong ?
it' s my sister .
she' s not well .
maybe i can help .
no .
out of my way .
just get out .

this way .
this is olivera .
we' ve been overrun .
request immediate chopper evac .
we need to find somewhere to stop for a moment .
i don' t think that' s a good idea .
there might be more of those ... ... things .
if there were more , we' d have seen them by now .
you know what they are ?
they' re bio weapons ... ... from umbrella labs beneath the city .
how come you know so much about umbrella ?
i used to work for them .
damn it .
hold it .
what do you think you' re doing ?
he' s wounded .
the infection' s spreading .
i' m fine .
you should take care of him now .
it' il be more difficult later .
you know that .
no .
if it comes to that ... ... i' il take care of it myself .
as you wish .
it' s nothing personal .
but in an hour , maybe two ... ... you' il be dead .
and moments later , you' il become one of them .
you' il endanger your friends , try to kill them ... ... probably succeed .
i' m sorry .
that' s just the way it is .
help me !
there' s too many of them .
let' s get out of here .
this way !
sir , t virus infection has reached critical levels .
this is a perfect opportunity .
ensure all data streams are recorded .
activate nemesis program now .
hey !
here !
we' re down here !
hey !
come !
we' re here !
where are they going ?
they' re landing there .
let' s get yuri !
come on , yuri .

we' il get you fixed up .
come .
hold on , yuri .
we' re almost there .
no .
no !
don' t leave !

we' re coming !
they dropped something .
maybe a radio .
one that works .
take yuri .
hold on , yuri .
nicholai , put me down .
okay , rest here .
what is this ?
looks like weapon cases .
we don' t need weapons .
we need evacuation !
these weren' t meant for us .
yuri !
plenty to go around .
don' t shoot !
i got the power .
thank you !
owe you one , man .
shit !
maybe i was safer outside .
get them guns out of my damn face .
motherfucker , please .
look ... ... my shit is custom .
what the fuck is that ?
shit !
you' re going down , you son of a bitch !
fuck .
deploy defensive formation .
take him down .
you fuckers is crazy .
look at that guy , got a rocket launcher .
what do we have ?
a dozen armed men .
well organized .
i' m surprised there' s anyone left .
they' re s. t. a. r. s.
special tactics and rescue squad .
they' re the best .
fire !
back !
fall back !
let' s see how good they really are .
altering protocols .
s. t. a. r. s.
oh , shit .
respect .
those were some pretty slick moves back there .
i' m good ... ... but i' m not that good .
you should be thankful for that .
what do you mean ?
they did something to me .
i barely feel human anymore .
we should keep moving .
before the sound attracts anything .
keep moving .
hello ?
god , i thought you' d never answer .
who is this ?
i can get you out of the city .
all four of you .
but first we have to come to an arrangement .
are you ready to make a deal ?
do we have a choice ?
not if you want to live past tonight , no .
his name is dr. ashford and he ...
runs the genetics and viral research division of umbrella corporation .
what' s he want with us ?
his daughter , angela , is trapped in the city .
umbrella was to evac her , but she didn' t make it .
she' s hiding out in her school .
we find her , he' il help us escape the perimeter .
no fucking deal .
we find the building with the thickest walls and doors ... ... and we barricade ourselves in .
sit tight , wait for help .
there won' t be any help .
umbrella knows they can' t contain the infection .
so at sunrise this morning , raccoon city will be completely sanitized .
what do you mean by " sanitized " ?
a precision tactical nuclear device .
what yield ?
five kilotons .
fuck me .
stupid .
what does that mean ?
it means it' il destroy the infection ... ... and all evidence of it .
it' s bullshit .
it' s bullshit !
no fucking way would they get away with that !
it would be all over the fucking news !
cover up .
cover up' s already prepared .
a meltdown at the nuclear power plant .
a tragic accident .
not even umbrella is capable of this .
not capable ?
peyton , you were there at the bridge .
you know exactly how far umbrella will go .
so , what do we do now , huh ?
i think we should be out of here by sunrise .
what if there is no way out and he' s watching us on these cameras ... ... like this is some kind of sick game ?
what is it ?
what' s going on ?
wait .
sunrise ain' t gonna wait .
no .
there' s something down there .
where ?
there .
i don' t see anything .
that doesn' t alter the fact that there is something down there .
i' m getting sick of this bullshit !
peyton !
no !
he' s located another two s. t. a. r. s. members .
nemesis .
run .
just go !
primary target is identified .
gentlemen , this is what we' ve been waiting for .
confirm at 2 : 18 and 27 seconds .
the nemesis program is now fully activated .
look , i' m ...
i' m sorry about your friend .
let' s just get to the school and find this kid .
this bite ... ... it won' t stop bleeding .
why didn' t they see us ?
what ?
the chopper .
we were right there in the street in front of the hospital .
how could they not see us ?
they saw us .
what do you mean ?
we' re assets , nicholai .
expendable assets .
and we' ve just been expended .
stop !
i' m not one of those things .
hey , remember me ?
look , i haven' t been bitten or anything .
look .
climb aboard .
lloyd jefferson wade .
you can call me l. j. on account of the informal situation .
we' re gonna have to split up to search this place .
forget it .
forget it !
i' m not going out there by myself .
i can go with you .
you , take the first floor .
you , take the second .
i' il take the basement .
i' ve never shot a gun before .
there' s nothing to it .
try to hit them in the head .
i see you , mother ...
oh , shit !
so did you get the call as well ?
what ?
you' re here for the girl ?
oh , yeah , yeah .
the girl .
dr. ashford didn' t say he made a deal with someone else .
i guess we' re partners .
shit .
angela ?
it' s gonna be okay .
there' s no need to be afraid .
we' re gonna take you home .
oh , my god .
help me !
terri ?
you can' t help her .
not now .
i' ve seen what they do .
are you angela ?
yes .
we should hurry before they come back .
hold this .
angela ashford , huh ?
that' s a pretty grown up name for a little girl .
i' m not a little girl .
besides ... ... all my friends call me angie .
angie , huh ?
i like that .
those things are in here .
it' s okay , honey .
they' re slow .
we can run around them .
no .
not them .
them .
get back .
stay .
thought you might need a hand .
you work for umbrella ?
used to .
until they left us for dead in this place .
now i consider myself freelance .
sergeant nicholai genovev , at your service .
come on !
wait !
angie !
save the girl !
i' ve got this bitch .
oh , shit .
from now on , stay right beside me .
it' s blocked .
what do we do now ?
wait here .
okay ?
thank you .
you two know each other ?
she' s infected .
she' s infected on a massive level .
how can you know that ?
because she is too .
you' re infected ?
when were you gonna tell us that ?
let me see .
no .
you know i' m not gonna hurt you .
let me see .
it' s the antivirus , the cure to the t virus .
there' s a cure ?
how did you get this ?
my daddy .
my daddy made it for me .
he' s sick .
and someday , i' il get sick too .
he just wanted to stop that .
when i was little ... ... i had to walk on crutches .
they said i' d never get better , just worse .
he found a way to make me stronger .
the t virus .
then they took the invention away from him .
get out of my house !
he' s not a bad man .
he didn' t mean for any of this .
it' s okay .
don' t shoot !
he' s cool .
he made a deal with dr. doom , same as you .
how many of you guys are there ?
what do you mean ?
nicholai .
when were you bitten ?
three hours ago .
what the ... ?
it' s your lucky day .
should have told me you got bit .
i' m hanging with you and shit .
let me speak to my daughter .
first , you tell us how we' re getting out .
there' s a helicopter already being prepped .
it takes off in 47 minutes .
it' il be the last transport to leave raccoon city before they detonate .
i take it this helicopter isn' t laid out just for us .
no .
it has another purpose , but it' il be lightly guarded .
where' s the evac site ?
may i speak to my daughter now ?
daddy ?
hey , sweetheart .
are you all right ?
when can i see you ?
soon .
these people will bring you to see me .
i' il see you very soon .
put the lady back on .
where do we have to go ?
the helicopter will be at city hall .
i suggest you make haste .
computers ... ... so unreliable .
just like people .
you really thought i didn' t know ?
so , what are you injecting me with ?
the antivirus .
the t virus reanimates dead cells .
basically , bringing the dead to life .
or in a living human , it can cause uncontrollable mutation .
or it can help her walk again , if the virus is kept in check with this .
angie' s infected ?
yes .
the cellular growth is enough to regenerate her ... ... but not enough to cause mutation .
and they infected you with the t virus as well ?
yeah .
but don' t worry .
i' m not contagious .
here .
tape the story .
i' il see that it gets put to good use .
my name is alice .
i worked for the umbrella corporation ... ... the largest and most powerful commercial entity in the world .
i was head of security at a secret high tech facility called the hive ... ... a giant underground laboratory developing experimental ... ... viral weaponry .
let' s go .
you missed one .
we have to hurry .
we' re okay .
we have time .
no !
we have to hurry .
holy shit !
we stealing his ride !
take off .
i said , take off !
what' s the rush ?
we' ve been expecting you .
perimeter secure .
all sectors locked down .
angie !
daddy !
i knew you wouldn' t leave me .
no .
never .
discard primary weaponry .
the two of you showed such promise , but we had to see you in action .
and most impressive you' ve been .
you' re like brother and sister .
heightened speed , strength , agility , the same killer instincts .
parallel strands of research .
and now ...
now we' il discover which is superior .
fight him .
no .
fight him , or they die .
what makes you think i care ?
daddy !
daddy , no .
no .
he was a valuable asset to the corporation .
i don' t even care about these people .
begin .
he' s mutating .
i want him in the nemesis program .
matt !
cellular structure breaking down .
t virus is manifesting itself in a genetic mutation .
we' re seeing similar cellular regeneration .
i' m sorry .
oh , matt .
i' m so sorry .
finish him .
i said , finish him .
no .
no .
don' t you understand how important you are to me ?
that creature is one thing , but you ... ... somehow you bonded with the t virus on a cellular level .
you adapted it , changed it .
you became magnificent .
i became a freak .
no .
you' re not mutation .
you' re evolution .
with my help , just imagine what you can achieve .
what about him ?
evolution has its dead ends .
now , finish this .
put him out of his misery ... ... and come with me .
no .
you' re such a disappointment to me .
all that strength ... ... but no will to use it .
what a waste .
prepare for takeoff .
sanitation of raccoon city to commence on my mark .
kill her .
what are you doing ?
get us airborne .
this is cain .
priority overload .
initiate launch proceedings .
detonation set at t minus 5 minutes .
angie , get down !
why haven' t we taken off ?
because i usually drive a cadillac .
surrender , or we open fire .
drop it .
alice !
drop your weapon and surrender .
let' s get this thing in the air !
you have to get up .
matt ...
come on , we have to go .
we have to go .
come on .
come on .
get up !
if you expect me to beg , i will not .
wait .
killing me won' t put things right .
no ... ... but it' s a start .
are you going to be all right ?
hang on to something !
we' re going down !
u gamma 9 to base .
confirmation .
we' ve located the crash site .
fetch the medical team .
what about the others ?
no other bodies found , sir .
we have unconfirmed reports of disaster at raccoon city .
these shocking images just in .
a mysterious plague or viral outbreak has run rampant ...
implicating umbrella corporation in deaths of innocent citizens .
this tape , work of former raccoon 7 anchorwoman terri morales .
new evidence now discredits earlier reports ...
nothing more than sick joke .
fake videotape totally discredited .
nothing more than a big hoax .
playing on the very real tragedy ... ... which overwhelmed raccoon city this week .
the reactor at the nuclear power station went critical .
the worst atomic disaster since the russian chernobyl incident in 1986 .
the state governor personally thanked the umbrella corporation ... ... for their swift action .
the perpetrators of the hoax , jill valentine and carlos olivera ... ... now being sought for questioning by the police .
alice .
alice , wake up .
can you hear me ?
do you understand what i' m saying ?
good .
begin the purging process .
her recovery' s remarkable .
and her powers , both physical and mental ... ... are developing at a geometric rate .
where are you ?
you' re safe .
come on .
that' s it .
there we are .
do you know what that is ?
it' s a pen .
you see ?
you try .
that' s it .
pen .
look at me .
can you remember anything ?
you remember your name ?
my name ?
my name .
i want her under 24 hour observation .
a complete set of blood work .
chemical and electrolyte analysis by the end of the day .
my name .
my name .
sir .
advanced reflex testing is a priority .
my name .
monitor electrical impulses ...
sir .
sir !
what is it ?
my name ... ... is alice .
and i remember everything .
this is central .
request immediate backup .
maximum response .
thank you , gentlemen .
we' il take over from here .
on whose authority ?
classified .
level six authorization .
sorry , sir .
let them go .
good to have you back .
are you all right ?
program alice activated .
what did they do to you ?
this is a product of the umbrella corporation .
our business is life itself .
some side effects may occur .
