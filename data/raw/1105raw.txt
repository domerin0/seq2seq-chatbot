ted ?
are you being sued ?
oh , hey , if this is about that freeman kid ...
he' s lying .
i mean , okay , maybe i shouldn' t have been drilling left handed but he dared me ...
would you shut up .
it' s about a will .
but i definitely think they have the wrong theodore brooks .
it' s about some lady in alaska , a place called tolketna .
alaska ? !
they definitely got the wrong ted brooks .
see , they' re looking for the white ted brooks .
well , her name is lucy watkins ...
mom !
rupert , get her something to drink !
wait a minute , relax , relax .
sit down .
breathe , breathe .
here .
rinse and spit .
oh , teddy bear ...
how can i ... ?
how do i ... ?
how do you what ? !
ted ...
teddy ...
you' re adopted .
we always meant to tell you and then your father died ...
this doesn' t change anything .
you will always be my teddy bear ... my teddy bear ...
ted !
hey , ted , come on .
don' t trip on this .
all right ?
a lot of people are adopted .
famous people .
you know , you got webster and soon yi .
and those kids from different strokes they turned out okay .
i should' ve known .
please .
there were so many signs .
really ?
yeah , i ...
like what ?
well ...
like blue cheese !
i love blue cheese , and they hate it .
uncanny .
so how was it living with strangers ?
why am i a dentist , rupert ?
' cause your daddy' s a dentist .
maybe i was meant to do something different ... be someone else .
i' m an eskimo ? !
all right , cuz .
i got you everything you need for your trip to alaska .
i' m only going for a couple of days !
yeah , well , i know you just wanted a parka but your credit card wanted more .
oh , i got these shoes for myself .
yeah , fly , right ?
what is all of this , rupert ?
okay .
for those cold alaskan nights ... you know ... other than getting a little na nooky ...
i got you a personal , wearable ... warm and cold system .
it' s the ultimate climate control accessory .
but wait , there' s more .
there better not be more .
well ...
you' re gonna receive a bill for a massage chair .
out !
i like that co ...
shut up , chester !
i hate you !
when i bought this condo no one told me a little rat like you lived next door !
i' m so sick of your barking !
welcome to anchorage .
we got a real scorcher today ... expecting a high of three degrees .
as reigning champion , what have you learned ?
i know that nothing can be left to chance .
in this race ... man and beast must move as one .
and when i cross the finish line nothing refreshes like powerade ... the only drink on my sled .
attention , please .
final boarding call for flight 522 to tolketna ...

close the door !
hey , slick .
to your health , son .

honey , you can get anything your little heart desires .
except a decaf latte .
how about a cup of regular ?
fresh brewed yesterday .
sure , as long as it' s hot .
coffee ...
here you go .
a hot cup of java .
so , how are you enjoying tolketna ?
just trying to keep up with the hustle and bustle .
hey , mister we got to talk .
i' ve been waiting a long time for a dentist to come to town .
yeah , i got a canker sore in the back of my mouth .
and isn' t that stench unbearable ?
all right , quiet !
now , pipe down !
time to get started !
we got a will to read here !
george !

i just patched the last hole !
all right .
now , we' re here to read the last will and testament of lucy watkins .
so , here goes .
oh , " first off , i' d like to thank you all for coming .
though if there was a blizzard , i understand .
now , i don' t want any crying .
people should enjoy themselves .
so , barb , why don' t you pour a round of wild turkey on me .
pass it around .
here ya go .
what' s with sasquatch ?
zip your lip .
that' s thunder jack .
they call him that
' cause he got hit by thunder .
twice !
you can' t get hit by thunder .
now , pay attention .
now , i led a simple life
so don' t expect too many goodies to be bequeathed .
first , to peter yellowbear
my neighbor and fellow snow golfer
i leave my lucky putter .
but don' t expect it to improve your game .
next ...
to barb
my dear friend and boss
i give my shearling coat ... " which kept me warmer than any man ever did .
you don' t have to talk to it in the morning .
and
to my son
ted brooks
i' m sorry you never knew me
but to you i leave the rest of my worldly possessions .
i wish it were more .
oh ...
and to thunder jack
i leave my outhouse and all its contents .
now , in conclusion , i just want to say thanks
to all you misfits
outcasts
and just plain weirdos .
you made living ln this icebox fun .
if i end up in heaven
i' il put in a good word for you .
and if i end up down below well , at least it' s warm .
to lucy !
great gal .
to lucy .
it' s hard to breathe at this altitude , huh ?
eh , you' il get used to it after a week or so .
oh , no , i' m not planning on being here that long .
i' m just going to poke around ... get a feel for this lucy ... maybe inventory her valuables .
valuables ?
you obviously didn' t know her .
so , is that all you want ... is to pawn off all her stuff ?
well , do i owe her more than that ?
huh !
she pawned off her kid .
don' t talk about lucy like that .
you don' t know anything about her .
is that my fault ?
never mind .
forget it .
come on , i' il show you around .
oh , uh , no , thanks .
i think i want to go alone .
' kay .
okay .
one ceramic lamp .
with a tacky shade .
one very dirty throw rug .
yeah ... and ...
arctic challenge third place .
where did you come from ?
nobody said anything about lucy having a dog .
of course , no one said anything about her having a son , either .
oh , you' re hungry , huh ?
well , go tell whoever it is that feeds you .
all right .
let' s go see if we can find you some chow .
nope .
in here ?
where' s the dog food ?
not in here .
no dog food .
oh ...

nice doggy .
nice doggy .
aah !

ha , ha , wait , that tickles .
aah !
oh , no !

any more surprises ?
where' s those dogs ?
what ?
the dogs , where are they ?
they' re eating the house .
wait !
wait a minute !
oh , you can' t go in there !
this one dog is possessed .
he' s dangerous .
demon .
wait !
mr. thunder ?
look out .
how you doing , demon , huh ?
how' s my boy ?
oh ... looking good , kid .
how much you want for these mutts ?
oh , uh ... well , i haven' t checked the blue book yet .
i' il give you $200 .
each ?
no , for the whole lot .
well , that seems a little low .
i mean , even the puppies ... in the mall cost ...
you think i' m trying to chisel you ?
no .
you think i' m that kind of a man ?
why don' t we just step outside and settle this thing
eskimo style .
hey !
just you ... and me , a rope and a knife .
and the last man breathing gets the dogs .
$200 is great .
no , it' s not .
you just stay out of this , missy .
you cheap chiseler .
you and i both know that any of those dogs is worth $500 and demon' s probably worth $1, 000 .
really ?
i' m not going to let you take advantage of him just because he' s some dumb city slicker .
you want to sell those dogs , you look me up .
oh , what is this stuff ?
slump .
slump ?
mostly the stuff the butcher can' t sell .
hooves , lips , organs ... slump .
in miami , we call them hot dogs .
so , why did grizzly adams want these dogs , anyway ?
because the arctic challenge is in two weeks .
these dogs are champions .
except for nana , of course .
lucy just liked her company .
arctic challenge .
what is that ?
well , next to the iditarod , it' s the biggest dog race around .
five days across 400 miles ... of the most beautiful and rugged terrain in the world .
who' d be crazy enough to do that ?
your mother .
i' m not being frisky .
i i' m stuck .
that' s what all the guys say .
happens to everyone .
up and at ' em .
you' re all chapped .
here .
so , let me ask you something .
what ?
did lucy ever mention about who my father was ?
sorry .
no one even knew you existed .
oh , right .
well , there can' t be too many suspects .
how many black guys are there around here ?
including you ?
let me see ...
two .
arthur ?
you must be ted .
i' ve been waiting so long for this .
would you like to come in ?
of course .
thank you .
i was so worried that you wouldn' t have the time to see me before you left .
i have felt this terrible pain for so long .
me , too .
so , should i sit on a chair ... or would you prefer me to lie down ?
uh , chair' s fine .
so , it' s my left rear molar .
filling fell out a couple of years ago .
and now it' s purple .
and there' s this real rotten odor .
maybe it' s infected .
and you' re telling me this because ... ?
aren' t you a dentist ?
aren' t you my father ?
if i say yes , do i get a discount ?
doesn' t even look like me .
i , uh ... categorized all of lucy' s possessions .
these are the recommended prices .
this is what i' il settle for .
and you can keep ten percent for yourself .
oh , what about the dogs ?
give them to johnny lightning .
you mean thunder jack ?
sure , why not ?
he wants them .
i haven' t got any use for them .
thanks .
this' il only take a second .
yeah , sure .
you' re leaving ?
i don' t know what i was looking for .
but i sure didn' t find it .
well , what were you expecting ?
maybe a little truth .
find out about myself , learn why she gave me up ...
hey , why don' t you stick around for a bit ?
the arctic challenge is in two weeks .
there' s hundreds of people .
tv crews come around .
it' s going to be fun .
look , i like you .
if you' re ever in miami , look me up .
my number' s on all the buses .
wait !
stop !
i know who your father is .
hold it , hold it .
what now ?
his name is
james johnson .
relax , relax ...
you can do this .
good ...
i hate the snow .
well , well ...
lookie here .
come to sell me them dogs ?
you ?
you' re james johnson ?
i don' t much like people calling me james .
what ...
you' re white .
will you look at that !
do you know who i am ?
yeah .
you' re the fella that' s going to sell me those dogs .
no .
i' m your son .
well , so , how much you want for them ?
you knew ?
you knew the whole time , and you didn' t say anything ?
i don' t see any good coming from dredging up ancient history .
is that what i am ?
ancient history ?
i tell you what i' m going to do .
i can go up to $300 for the lot .
the dogs ?
don' t you think of anything else ?
you got no business with them .
i mean , they' re special animals .
they need to be taken care of .
you' re a real piece of work .
you know ...
i don' t believe we' re related .
there must be some mistake because you are definitely not my father !
well , tell you the truth ...
i don' t much give a hoot one way or the other .
all i' m saying is that you don' t belong here .
i' m sure you' ve got a nice , little condominium some place ... with a remote control color tv ... and a nice electric blanket .
so , why don' t you pack up your big city butt and go back there .
no .
i' m not going anywhere .
you are a stubborn fool .
no , you' re the stubborn fool !
you must have something wrong with that head .
no , you got something wrong with your head !
no , you got something wrong with your head !
no , you got something wrong in your head !
no , you got something wrong with your head .
oh , well , you know what they say .
the apple doesn' t fall far from the tree , jack .
or should i call you father ?
or how about papa ?
or maybe even daddy o .
i don' t belong here ?
i' il show him .
i' il be a mush master .
a regular sled doggy dogg !
just watch me , man .
dr. brooks speaking .

so , how' s alaska ?
basically , everything' s white ... including my father !
ma ?

well , that explains why you were always so crazy about that michael bolton .
this has gone on long enough , teddy .
i am coming up there .
you' re terrified of flying ...
rupert !
get off the phone !
i' m not on the phone !
when are you coming home ?
you know , your mother' s worried sick about you .

you' re going to wish you never met me !

you know what your problem is ?
see , demon' s got it in his head that he' s the alpha dog .
you' ve got to show him who' s boss !
bite him in the ear !
i am not putting any part of that dog in my mouth .
suit yourself .
any musher will tell you the same .
oh , you' re a musher ?
are you kidding ?
i' m the only man ever to win the arctic flame three years running .
congratulations .
yeah , well , it is kind of a strange award .
it goes to the person who comes in last .
in miami , three time losers go to prison .
forget it ... rest rooms are for customers only !
out of my way , girlie !
james johnson .
were you being coy , or is that some sick alaskan mind game ?
i' m sorry .
i swore to lucy i wouldn' t tell a soul about thunder jack .
i just didn' t want ... to see you leave like that .
bring it home !
whoa , there .
come on , whoa !
good boy .
excuse me .
it' s time for round two .
all right , nana , if there' s any trouble , you back me up .
oh , jack !
i got something for you .
mr. thunder ?
look , maybe we started off on the wrong foot .
listen , i know this can' t be easy for you .
it' s not for me .
i had to show up on your doorstep after so many years and i got so many questions ...
i can go to four .
excuse me ?
i can go to $400 , but that' s it .
see , it' s mainly demon that i want .
this is not about the dogs !
look , jack !
got in your new shipment of blue cheese .
oh ...
danish , right ?
oh , yeah .
nothing crumbles like danish .
i never seen a man who could eat as much cheese as you do .
they ought to call you monterey jack .
nobody can eat as much cheese as i can .
hey .
hey , no , hey .
hey , give me that cheese .
i' il show you eating cheese !
give me that cheese .
come on , give me that cheese ... or somebody' s going to get hurt .
all right .
let' s get down to business .
you are not equipped to keep those dogs .
they' re not city dogs .
they' re athletes ... they have to run
they have to get those hearts pounding otherwise , they go loco .
loco ?
so ... show me how to run them .
yeah , we could teach each other .
i need to learn to mush , and you need to learn to floss .
come on , jack .
we need a father and son activity .
father and what ?
sure ... can' t you see the resemblance ?
oh , yeah .
you want a piece of me ?
huh ?
you want some of that ?
what ?
what' s my name ?
you want a piece of me ?
come get it !
come get it ...
this was not a good idea !
who' s the alpha dog now ? !
okay , " place your feet on runners keeping your weight centered ...
blah , blah , blah , all right .
okay , just like a jet ski with fur .
stop that .
hey !
hey , knock it off .
stop it .
hey , how are you going to pull if you' re this way ?
you got to look that ...
come on , buddy .
i thought we could go ... for a picnic up on the mountain .
sorry .
can' t .
i' m mushing today .
see you .
you now , it' s not something you just learn overnight .
hey , it' s in my blood .
first off ... you have to step on the gang line before you cross over .
all right .
okay , this is all wrong .
you have mack ... next to scoop ... that' s a definite no no .
mack always runs best when he' s next to diesel .
okay .
see , i got your problem now .
i know what your problem is .
can you hold that ?
yeah .
hi , sweetie .
all right , that' s good .
and yodel and sniff over there are fine where you got them they' re your wheel dogs .
they' re not exactly the sharpest tools in the shed but they' il push or pull anything you give them .
look ... twins .
all right .
okay .
what do we do with this guy ?
girl .
this is duchess .
scoop over there has got ... the biggest crush on her .
the only way to calm him down is to ... put him with duchess !
good girl .
you two make a lovely couple .
okay , and that just leaves my evil half brother ...
demon .
no , he' s an incredible animal .
he was lucy' s pride .
yeah , with a lousy personality .
nice doggy .
nice doggy , nice ... doggy .
maybe you should try biting him on the ear .
what is it with you people ?
i' m cool .
you cool ?
sorry , nana but , uh ... big doggies only .
okay , just got to program my gps here ...
okay !
ready , set , move !
well , at least
i don' t have to worry about you getting lost .
let' s see you try to throw me this time .
no !
no !
oh , stop !
hey , teddy !
want to drag ? !
oh !
ooh !
bad dog !
bad dog !
fore !
sorry about that .
you know ...
i never would have thought of it .
thunder jack .
wow .
oh , i' m glad everybody' s having a great big laugh .
they are ... the way you drive that sled of yours ... that' s pretty funny .
nice day for a drive , huh , nana ?
eat your heart out .
nana
i finally understand sledding .
hmm .
what got into her ?
no .
oh , no .
no .
my eyes !
my eyes !
oh , got yourself a skunk , huh ?
good eating .
you know , you' re getting to be an embarrassment to me .
why didn' t you just tell them to stop ?
don' t talk to me like i' m four .
you' re not the boss of me .
of course i shouted , " stop .
they wouldn' t stop if you shout , " stop .
you have to shout , " break and hook .
break and hook .
got it .
i want to go , i say , " mush .
only in the movies do they say , " mush .
here you say , " hike .
if you want to go to the left you shout , " haw .
and if you want to go to the right you shout , " gee .
why not just say right and left ?
why do they got to make things so complicated ?
man , you really stink .
what' s that ?
don' t worry , mountain man .
it' s just me .
what are you doing here ?
i thought it' d be nice to walk the hill .
and it would be nicer if you give me a ride back down .
sure .
this is where i was going to take you for that picnic .
how did you know about it ?
i found lucy' s diary .
it' s quiet and perfect .
the one place i feel peaceful and can think about the big questions .
this is the place all the folks around here come for answers .
oh , nothing but time and places to think around here .
great places , sure , but , uh , no starbucks .
no indoor plumbing .
oh , yeah ?
you know what else they don' t have in this town ?
crime , traffic , buses to put your face on .
i ...
if i could just get that old man to sit down with me for an hour .
just to find out what happened .
it isn' t like i want anything from him .
i don' t need a father .
i had a father ... and he' s nothing like my father was .
my dad was a great person .
everyone looked up to him .
and your mom ?
my mom ?
she' s amazing .
she does everything for me .
for everybody .
and her sugar cookies .
oh !
you haven' t lived till you had one of my mom' s sugar cookies .
yeah , i miss her .
maybe the answers for me aren' t even up here at all .
maybe the answers for me are hopping on the next plane back to civilization .
you know , the thing about lucy ... is she didn' t always win the race but she never quit .
maybe you need ... to finish what you started ... mountain man .
oh , that' s cool .
that' s scary .
you are such a city boy .
so ... how did you sleep ?
that' s beautiful .
let' s go .
run , dogs , run !

i was out about three days ... and this storm blew in .
and i should' ve , you know , bunked down but i kept going thinking i could sneak up a couple of spots , you know ?
that' s when it turned ugly .
the only thing ... that saved me was finding this cave .
and lucy was already here , hunkered down with her dogs .
now , i' d met her a couple of times in town but we weren' t what you' d call friends , you know ?
but cold weather brings people together in a strange way .
well , you can guess the rest .
when i woke up in the morning ...
lucy and the dogs were already gone .
she finished ninth that year .
i came in 19th .
after the race , i ...
i tried to find her ... but she' d already gone .
that' s it ?
afraid so .
it' s all i know .
well , a bargain' s a bargain .
i guess the dogs are yours .
oh , well , i' il take good care of them .
i guess i' d better be getting on home .
here you go .
here , have some soup .
i thought you said this was soup !
well , there' s soup in it .
kid , come on .
i want to get airborne before the winds pick up .
final boarding call .
hi , chester .
hi , buddy .
for the mushers and their dogs nothing can match this moment .
we' re here at the starting line awaiting the signal to begin the 112th
arctic challenge sled dog races .
and we' il be here bringing you a word' s eye view of all the color and excitement .
back to you , pete .
my people , i love you .
will you look at that ?
now , demon , look at me .
my hands are shot .
this is going to be my last go round .
and probably yours , too .
so , what do you say we just give them something to remember us by , huh ?
ah , that' s my boy .
there he goes the michael jordan of dogsledding
olivier trajean .
teddy ?
ooh , my lord , it' s freezing in here .
you see that dog out front ?
that' s the lead dog .
those two in back , they' re the wheel dogs but it' s the lead dog that drives the team .
he' s finished dead last three years in a row ...
why am i a dentist ?
you always wanted to be a dentist .
except for that one year you wanted to be the six million dollar man .
you were always running in slow motion .
we had to take ten extra minutes just to get anywhere .
oh , teddy .
is this tolketna ?
who' s this ?
oh , that' s barb .
she' s just a friend .
so this is ...
she' s pretty .
she looks just like you .
oh , teddy , i' m so sorry .
i' il get it cleaned up right now .
don' t bother , i' il get a broom .
so , is this the father ?
who ?
this white man with her and the baby .
oh , look how cute you are , teddy .
he lied to me .
hello ?
yes , i need your next flight to alaska .
a test of speed and agility today ... at the arctic challenge .
here at the finish line the weatheris fine , but out on the course a massive arctic storm is blowing in tonight .
the lead teams are bunking at the rusty knife checkpoint hoping that morning will bring relief .
hey , girl .
good girl .
how they look ?
feet look good .
old demon never changes , huh , jack ?
been kind of ornery ever since victoria passed .
what kind of a man eats before he feeds his dogs ?
don' t worry , they already docked him 20 minutes for that one .
uh , jack , there' s a storm brewing out there .
everybody' s bunking in .
come on .
i saved you a spot by the heater .
thanks , ernie .
come on , demon !
pick it up .
pick it up .
pick it up , demon .
hey , hold up , there .
the old fool .
hi .
george .

i got to find jack .
ted , there' s something you need to know .
later .
he lied to me .
come on .
ted ?
wait .
what ?
jack' s missing .
what ?
he made the check in at rusty knife .
then the old fool headed straight into a storm .
that' s the last anybody saw of him .
and the weather' s gotten so bad ... the rescue crews had to turn back .
i know where he is .
you think you know where he is .
he could be anywhere within a hundred square miles .
come on .
you can' t do this .
when i was lost he came looking for me .
i' m not going to let him die out there .
ted , you don' t even have a lead dog .
sure , i do .
there' s my lead dog .
hi , nana .
nana ? !
nana' s not a lead dog .
sure , she is .
if i can be a musher ... she can be a lead dog .
that a girl , nana .
ted ... please be careful .
ready up !
mush !
mush !
get up there !
ha !
ha !

and it looks like our winner is going to be , once again ...
hey !
isn' t that guy going the wrong way ?
hey , check out ted .
go !
yeah , go !
get up there !
olivier !
did you see him ?
no more slump , boys !
it' s milk bone for everyone !
olivier , you' ve won the arctic challenge .
what are you going to do next ?
i' m going to disneyland , paris .
olivier !
look what you' ve done .
we must run away .
i am so sorry ... but all i' ve got is american money .
paging dr. te ...
here , let me help you .
oh , thank you .
you must be ted' s mother .
well , you must be barb .
so , what did he tell you about me ?
he says you make amazing cookies .
aw , that is just like ted .
he wouldn' t say a bad thing about anyone .
where is he ?
that' s it !
that' s it !
come on , guys .
come on , come on .
right , right , left , left , right !
come on , come on !
come on !
okay , okay .
two minute break .
two minute break .
scooper , what have you got now ?
sure , you can dig , but you can' t pull ?
but wait a minute .
just wait .
now , this is my son .
aren' t you supposed to send a search party or a posse or something ?
look , ma' am ... we' re sorry , but there' s simply no way to go through the pass .
and it' s too windy to send up a chopper .
i' m sorry .
excuse me .
i couldn' t help overhearing .
did you say your son is out there ?
to the men and women of the arctic challenge the arctic flame is a symbol of hope .
it can' t be extinguished until the last musher has found his way out of the wilderness and crossed the finish line .
this year , that flame flickers for one man
lost out on the trail old time sledding legend , thunder jack johnson .
but we' ve now learned of a startling unofficial rescue effort that' s underway .
ted brooks ...
yeah ! get this , a dentist from miami , florida ... is bravely facing the storm with his own team of dogs .
you go , ted .
tonight , somewhere in the darkness ... a story as old as time itself unfolds as man and animal work together , braving the elements in what has become not a race of winners and losers but simply a race for survival .
whoa , whoa , brake it off .
jack ?
easy , demon , easy .
jack ?
okay .
good job , boys .
okay , good , good boy .
good dog .
all right , good boy .
good job .
oh , jack .
jack .
okay .
what are you doing here ?
your leg' s broke .
i' m splinting it .
yeah .
well , how' d you get here ?
same way you did .
not bad for a greenhorn , huh ?
not bad at all .
so , what kind of crazy stunt were you trying to pull out there ?
oh , i thought i could win if i rode off into that storm .
but if i' d bunked in like i should' ve
i wouldn' t have run into that tree , and ...
what ... ?
it' s the latest in personal climate control .
i guess i ought to thank you for coming after me .
because you didn' t ... you didn' t have to , you know .
it' s payback .
now we' re even .
no , we' re not even .
you know , i' ve always believed that a man who don' t tell it like it is , is a liar .
and i hate liars .
well , i lied to you , son .
i was at that hospital .
the night you were born , well ... why , you were no bigger than a loaf of bread .
i walked into that room , and the doctor just placed you right in my hands , just like that .
and in all my life i' d never seen anything like it .
but me and lucy knew that we we had no business trying to raise you .
you know , we were no good for each other and we ... we race dogs .
but , uh , kids ...
but lucy ... wanted to bring you into this world .
but she knew that it would be better if somebody else raised you .
so , now , you can' t blame everything on lucy .
i was nowhere near ready to be a father .
see ... we were independent spirits , lucy and me .
oh , we' d see each other from time to time and , you know ...
but i did love her .
oh ... oh , i loved that woman .
i miss her .
did she love you ?
well , she said so once .
and then she poked me right in the face .
yeah , but you turned out okay .
look ...
i bet lucy would be proud of you .
i know i am .
mrs. brooks ... why don' t you come inside ?
they' il sound off the siren when one of them comes in .
i' m not going to leave him .
i can' t .
all right , guys , let' s go .
come on , let' s go .
okay , demon , let' s get that harness on .
oh , that dog' s not going anywhere .
well , what' s wrong with him ?
he' s , uh , gnawing at his harness won' t eat .
he' s just one unhappy dog .
gnawing at his harness , huh ?
yeah .
all right , demon , let' s take a look at your chompers .
okay , demon .
you leave me no choice .
good , good boy .
come .
i can' t believe ... you actually ... bit that dog on the ear .
but that' s what everyone says you' re supposed to do .
well , sure , but ...
i never met a man dumb enough to do it .
okay .
all right .
good boy .
open wide .
there we go .
let' s see what you got there .
here' s the problem .
oh , okay , all right .
all right , demon .
trust me , i' m not going to hurt you .
okay ?
my , my , my .
well , if you want to bite me now , go ahead .
mush !
there' s a medic down at caribou falls .
what do you want to do ?
i have never not finished a race .
well , i' m not going to let you start now .
go ahead , demon !
teddy , i' m slipping out .
hang on , jack !
hang on !
oh .
oh , yeah .
demon , get it , baby !
way to go , demon !
barb , i have a confession to make .
are you barb ?
i never told ted he was adopted .
i know .
there were so many times when i could have told him .
it would have been ... the right thing to do .
i know that now .
but from the first moment i held him in my arms
i couldn' t have loved him more .
but i was afraid .
i was afraid if i told him the truth he wouldn' t love us ... not in the same way .
barb , tell me he' s going to cross that finish line .
he' s going to cross the finish line .
amelia , he' s going to cross the finish line .
oh , i know , dear ... it' s just a mother' s worry .
i keep thinking ...
it' s the siren .
he' s coming in .
that' s it !
let' s go !
what' s going on ?
oh , barb !
oh ... oh , wait !
get me a close up .
let me help you , jack .
not bad for a dentist from miami , huh ?
not bad .
not bad at all .
ted !
let me through , please .
ted !
you' re here .
you came all the way here ... to alaska .
i got on a plane ... and 14 hours of prayer later , here i am .
come here ... there' s someone i want you to meet .
jack ... this ... this here' s my mama .
oh , baby .
oh , baby .
well , it , uh ... it certainly is a pleasure to meet you , ma' am .
you and your husband ... certainly did a fine job with this guy .
oh , barb .
he' s an amazing guy .
he really is .
i' m so happy for you .
dr. brooks , the honor is yours .
jack , i believe you earned this .
i think we both should blow it out together .
okay , ernie .
dr. brooks is ready to see you now .
i haven' t finished ... reading about the crown and the bridge yet .
come on .
oh , well ...
oh , here they are .
avalanche .
little aleutia .
and there' s chinook .
and my favorite , demon junior .
good to see you , ernie .
doctor , is this going to hurt ?
oh , just a little .
more than a tickle ... and less than paying your taxes .
okay , open wide .
