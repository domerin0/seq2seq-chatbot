let me tell you what " like a virgin " is about .
it' s all about a girl who digs a guy with a big dick .
the entire song is a metaphor for big dicks .
no , it ain' t .
it' s about a girl who' s very vulnerable .
she' s been fucked over a few times and she meets a guy who' s sensitive .
whoa .
timeout .
tell that bullshit to the tourists .
toby ?
who the fuck is toby ?
like a virgin " is not about some sensitive girl who meets a nice fella .
that' s what " true blue " is about .
no argument about that .
which one is " true blue " ?
it was a big ass hit for madonna .
i don' t even follow that top of the pops shit , and i' ve heard of " true blue .
i didn' t say i ain' t heard of it .
all i asked is , how' s it go ?
excuse me for not being the world' s biggest madonna fan .
personally , i can do without her .
i used to like her early stuff , " borderline " ... but once she got off with that " papa , don' t preach " phase , i tuned out .
hey , you guys are making me lose my train of thought here .
i was sayin ' something .
what was it ?
oh , toby' s that little chinese girl .
what was her last name ?
what' s that ?
it' s an old address book i found in a coat i haven' t worn in a coon' s age .
what was that name ?
what the fuck was i talkin ' about ?
you said " true blue " was about a guy a sensitive girl who meets a nice guy ... but " like a virgin " was a metaphor for big dicks .
let me tell you what " like a virgin " is about .
it' s all about this cooze who' s a regular fuck machine .
i' m talkin ' morning , day , night , afternoon ... dick , dick , dick , dick , dick , dick , dick , dick , dick !
how many " dicks " is that ?
a lot .
then one day , she meets this john holmes motherfucker .
it' s like , " whoa , baby . " he' s like charles bronson in " the great escape .
he' s diggin ' tunnels .
now she' s gettin ' serious dick action .
she' s feelin ' somethin ' she ain' t felt since forever : pain , pain .
chew ?
toby chew ?
it hurts .
it hurts her .
it shouldn' t hurt her .
her pussy should be bubble yum by now .
but when this cat fucks her , it hurts .
it hurts just like it did the first time .
you see , the pain is reminding a fuck machine ... what it was once like to be a virgin .
hence , " like a virgin .
wong .
give me that fuckin ' thing .
what in hell do you think you' re doin ' ?
i' m sick of hearin ' it , joe .
i' il give it back to you when we leave .
what do you mean , when we leave ?
give me it back now !
for the past 15 minutes now , you' ve been droning on about names .
toby .
toby ?
toby ?
toby wong .
toby wong ?
toby wong .
toby chung fuckin ' charlie chan .
i' ve got madonna' s big dick comin ' out of my left ear ... and toby the jap i don' t know what comin ' out of my right .
give me that book .
are you gonna put it away ?
i' m gonna do whatever the fuck i want with it .
well , then i' m afraid i' m gonna have to keep it .
hey , joe , want me to shoot this guy ?
shit .
you shoot me in a dream , you better wake up and apologize .
you guys been listenin ' to k bllly' s " super sounds of the ' 70s " weekend ?
yeah .
that' s fuckin ' great .
you believe the songs they' re playin ' ?
know what i heard the other day ?
heartbeat , it' s a lovebeat " by little tony defranco and the defranco family .
i haven' t heard that song since i was in the fifth fuckin ' grade .
when i was comin ' down here , " the night the lights went out in georgia " came on .
i ain' t heard that song since it was big .
but when it was big , i must' ve heard it a million trillion fuckin ' times .
but this is the first time i ever realized ... that the girl singin ' the song is the one who shot andy .
you didn' t know that vickie lawrence was the one who shot andy ?
i thought the cheatin ' wife shot andy .
they say that at the end of the song .
i know , motherfucker .
i just heard it .
that' s what i' m talkin ' about .
i must' ve zoned out during that part before .
all right , i' il take care of the check .
all right , i' il take care of the check .
you guys can get the tip .
should be about a buck apiece .
and you , when i come back i want my book .
sorry .
it' s my book now .
hey , i changed my mind .
shoot this piece of shit , will ya ?
all right , everybody cough up some green for the little lady .
come on , throw in a buck .
i don' t tip .
you don' t tip ?
i don' t believe in it .
you don' t believe in tipping ?
do you know what these chicks make ?
they make shit .
if she don' t make enough money , she can quit .
i don' t even know a fuckin ' jew who' d have the balls to say that .
let me get this straight .
you don' t ever tip , huh ?
i don' t tip because society says i have to .
if they really put forth the effort , i' il give ' em somethin ' extra .
but this tipping automatically , it' s for the birds .
as far as i' m concerned , they' re just doin ' their job .
this girl was nice .
she was okay .
she wasn' t anything special .
what' s special ?
take you in the back and suck your dick ?
i' d go over 12 % for that .
i ordered coffee , all right ?
she' s only filled my cup three times .
i want it filled six times .
six times ?
well , what if she' s too fuckin ' busy ?
the words " too fuckin ' busy " shouldn' t be in a waitress' s vocabulary .
excuse me , mr. pink , but the last fuckin ' thing you need' s ... another cup of coffee .
these ladies aren' t starvin ' to death .
they make minimum wage .
i used to work minimum wage , and when i did ...
i wasn' t lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tip worthy .
you don' t care they' re countin ' on your tips to live ?
you know what this is ?
the world' s smallest violin , playin ' just for the waitresses .
you don' t have any idea what you' re talkin ' about .
these people bust their ass .
this is a hard job .
so' s working at mcdonald' s , but you don' t feel the need to tip them .
they' re servin ' you food , but society says ...
don' t tip these guys over here , but tip these guys . " that' s bullshit .
waitressing is the number one occupation ... for female non college graduates in this country .
it' s the one job basically any woman can get and make a living on .
the reason is because of their tips .
fuck all that .
i' m very sorry the government taxes their tips .
that' s fucked up .
that ain' t my fault .
it would appear that waitresses are one of the many groups ... the government fucks in the ass on a regular basis .
show me a paper that says the government shouldn' t do that , i' il sign it .
i' il vote for it .
but what i won' t do is play ball .
learn to fuckin ' type .
if you' re expectin ' me to help out with the rent , you' re in for a big surprise .
he' s convinced me .
give me my dollar back .
hey .
leave the dollars there .
all right , ramblers , let' s get ramblin ' .
wait a minute .
who didn' t throw in ?
mr. pink .
mr. pink ?
why not ?
he don' t tip .
he don' t tip ?
you don' t tip ?
he don' t believe in it .
shut up .
what do you mean , you don' t believe in it ?
cough up a buck , you cheap bastard .
i paid for your goddamn breakfast .
since you bought breakfast , i' il put in .
but normally i would never do this .
never mind what you normally would do .
just cough in your goddamn buck like everybody else .
thank you .
that was the partridge family' s " doesn' t somebody want to be wanted ? " ... followed by edison lighthouse' s ...
love grows where my rosemary goes " ... as k bllly' s " super sounds of the ' 70s " weekend ... just keeps on truckin ' . just keeps on truckin ' .
i' m gonna die .
i' m gonna die !
just hold on , buddy boy !
i' m gonna die !
i' m sorry !
give me your hand .
i can' t believe she killed me , man !
who' d have fuckin ' thought that ?
hey , just cancel that shit right now !
you' re hurt .
you' re hurt real fuckin ' bad , but you ain' t dying !
all this blood' s scarin ' the shit out of me , larry !
i' m gonna die !
i know it !
excuse me , i didn' t realize you had a degree in medicine .
are you a doctor ?
are you a doctor ?
answer me , please !
are you a doctor ?
no , i' m not .
i' m not .
so you admit you don' t know what you' re talkin ' about .
if you' re through givin ' me your amateur opinion , lie back and listen .
i' m takin ' you back to the rendezvous , joe' s gonna get you a doctor ... the doctor' s gonna fix you up and ... you' re gonna be okay .
now say it !
you' re gonna be okay !
say it !
you' re gonna be okay !
say the goddamn words !
you' re gonna be okay !
oh , god !
say the goddamn fuckin ' words !
say it !
okay , larry .
correct !
correct !
i' m okay .
look where we are .
look where we are .
she had a baby , man .
she had a baby !
we' re in a warehouse .
who' s a tough guy ?
who' s a tough guy ?
come on , who' s a tough guy ?
who' s a tough guy ?
you' re a tough guy .
you' re a fuckin ' tough guy .
we' re in a warehouse .
look where we are .
we made it .
we made it .
we fuckin ' made it .
we have fuckin ' made it .
we' re in a warehouse .
look where we are .
look where we are .
hold on .
hold on .
shit !
stop bangin ' your head .
you' re gonna bang a fuckin ' hole in the floor .
you don' t wanna hurt the fuckin ' floor , do you ?
i can' t do anything for you .
but when joe gets here ... which should be any time now ... he' s gonna help you out , he' s gonna take care of you .
we' re gonna sit and wait for joe .
who are we waitin ' for ?
joe .
larry , i' m fucking scared , man .
would you please hold me ?
yeah , sure .
you go ahead and be scared .
you' ve been brave enough for one day .
i just want you to relax now , okay ?
you' re not gonna fuckin ' die .
you' re gonna be fine .
when joe gets here , he' il make you 100 % again .
am i hurt ?
i' m hurt bad , larry .
it' s not good , no .
hey , larry ... bless your heart for what you' re tryin ' to do .
i was panicking for a minute back there .
but i got my senses back now .
the situation is , i' m shot in the belly .
without medical attention , i' m gonna die .
i can' t take you to a hospital .
fuck jail , man !
you don' t have to take me in .
just drive me up to the front , man .
just drop me on the sidewalk .
i' il take care of myself .
i won' t tell ' em anything , man .
i won' t tell ' em anything .
i swear to fucking god , man .
just look in my eyes , larry .
look in my eyes .
i won' t tell them anything .
you' il be safe , man .
you' re not gonna fuckin ' die , kid .
all right ?
listen to me .
you' re gonna be fine .
along with the kneecap ... the gut is the most painful area a guy can get shot in .
no shit !
but it takes a long time to die from it .
i' m talkin ' days .
you' re gonna wish you were dead , but it takes days to die from your wound .
time is on your side .
was that a fucking setup , or what ?
shit .
orange got tagged ?
gut shot .
fuck .
where' s brown ?
dead .
how did he die ?
how the fuck do you think ?
the cops shot him .
this is bad .
this is so fucking bad .
is it bad ?
as opposed to good ?
man , this is fucked up .
this is so fucked up .
somebody fucked us up big time , man .
you really think we were set up ?
do you even doubt it , man ?
i don' t think we got set up , i know it .
where did all those cops come from , huh ?
one minute they' re not there , and the next minute they' re there .
i didn' t hear any sirens .
the alarm went off , okay ?
when an alarm goes , you got a four minute response time .
unless a patrol car is cruising that street at that moment ... you got four minutes before they can realistically respond .
in one minute , there were 17 blue boys out there ... all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing , and they were all there !
remember that second wave that showed up in the cars ?
those were the ones responding to the alarm , but those first motherfuckers ... they were there and they were waitin ' for us .
haven' t you fuckin ' thought about this ?
i haven' t had a chance to think .
first i was just tryin ' to get the fuck outta there .
and after we got away , i' ve just been dealin ' with him .
better start thinkin ' about it , ' cause that' s all i' m thinkin ' about .
i wasn' t even gonna come here .
i was just gonna drive off , man ... because whoever set us up knows about this place .
there could' ve been cops here waitin ' !
there could be cops comin ' right now !
let' s go in the other room .
hey .
in there .
larry , don' t leave me .
i' il be right in the other room , okay ?
i' il be right there lookin ' at ya .
i' m right here lookin ' at you , okay ?
i' m right over there .
larry ...
i' m gonna fucking die .
larry .
what the fuck am i doin ' here , man ?
i felt funny about this job right off .
as soon as i felt it i should have said , " no , thank you , " but i never listen .
every time i ever got fucked buying weed , the same thing .
i didn' t trust the guy , but i wanted to believe him .
if he' s not lying and it really is thai stick , then it' s great .
but it never is , and i always said that if i felt that about a job , i' d walk .
and i didn' t .
i didn' t because of the fuckin ' money !
what' s done is done .
i need you cool .
are you cool ?
i' m cool .
splash some water on your face .
take a breather .
relax .
have a cigarette .
i quit .
all right .
why , you got one ?
okay , let' s go through what happened .
we' re in the place , everything' s going fine .
then the alarm gets tripped .
i turn around and all these cops are outside .
you' re right .
it was like , bam , i blinked my eyes and they' re there .
everybody starts going ape shit .
then mr. blonde starts to shoot all
that' s not correct .
what' s wrong with it ?
okay .
the cops did not show up after the alarm went off .
the cops didn' t show up until after mr. blonde started shootin ' everybody .
soon as i heard the alarm , i saw cops .
it wasn' t that soon .
they didn' t let their presence be known until after mr. blonde became a madman .
i' m not sayin ' they weren' t there .
i' m sayin ' they were there .
but they didn' t make a move until after mr. blonde started shootin ' everybody .
i mean , that' s how i know we were set up .
mr. white , you can see that  enough of this " mr. white " shit .
wait !
don' t tell me you' re fuckin ' name !
i don' t wanna know it !
jesus christ , i ain' t gonna tell you mine .
you' re right .
this is bad .
how did you get out ?
i shot my way out .
everybody started shootin ' , so i blasted my way out of there .
move it !
get outta the way !
get the fuck outta the way !
get the fuck outta the way !
move it !
get outta the way !
jesus christ !
what the fuck is your problem , man ?
you fuckin ' asshole !
fuck you !
move !
jesus !
get outta the car !
get the fuck outta the car !
move it !
move outta the way !
i tagged a couple of cops .
did you kill anybody ?
a few cops .
no real people ?
just cops .
could you believe mr. blonde ?
that was the most insane fuckin ' thing i have ever seen .
why the fuck would joe hire a guy like that ?
i don' t want to kill anybody .
if i gotta get out that door and you' re standin ' in my way ... one way or the other you' re gettin ' outta my way .
that' s the way i look at it .
the choice between doin ' ten years ... and takin ' out some stupid motherfucker ... ain' t no choice at all .
but i ain' t no madman , either .
what the fuck was joe thinkin ' ?
you can' t work with a guy like that .
we' re awful goddamn lucky he didn' t tag us when he shot the place up .
i came this close to takin ' his ass out myself .
i mean , everybody panics .
everybody .
things get tense .
it' s human nature .
you panic .
i don' t care what your name is , you can' t help it .
fuck , man , you panic on the inside , in your head , you know ?
you give yourself a couple of seconds , get ahold of it and deal with it .
what you don' t do is start shootin ' up the place and start killin ' people .
what you' re supposed to do is act like a fuckin ' professional .
a psychopath ain' t a professional .
you can' t work with a psychopath .
you don' t know what those sick assholes are gonna do next .
i mean , jesus christ , how old do you think that black girl was ?
twenty ?
maybe 21 ?
if that .
did you see what happened to anybody else ?
me and orange jumped in the car , brown floored it .
after that , i don' t know what went down .
it was every man for himself .
as far as mr. blonde and mr. blue are concerned , i ain' t got the foggiest ...
' cause once i got out , i never looked back .
what do you think ?
what do i think ?
the cops either caught ' em or killed ' em .
no chance they punched through ?
you found a hole .
yeah , and that was a fuckin ' miracle .
but even if they did get away , then where the fuck are they ?
you don' t think it' s possible one of ' em got ahold of the diamonds and
no , no way .
how can you be so sure ?
i got the diamonds .
that' s my boy .
where ?
i stashed ' em .
if you wanna come with me , let' s go get ' em right now , this second .
' cause i think stayin ' here , man , we should have our fuckin ' heads examined .
that was the plan .
we meet here .
then where the fuck is everybody ?
i say the plan becomes null and void once we found out we got a rat here .
we ain' t got the slightest idea what happened to mr. blonde or mr. blue .
they could both be dead or maybe they' re arrested .
the cops could have ' em right now at the station , sweatin ' ' em down .
they don' t know our names , but they could be singin ' about this place .
i swear to god , i think i' m fuckin ' jinxed .
what ?
two jobs back , it was a four man job .
we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop .
no shit ?
thank god we discovered in time .
we had to forget the whole thing , just walk the fuck away from it .
so who' s the rat this time ?
mr. blue ?
mr. brown ?
joe ?
joe set this whole thing up .
maybe he set it up to set it up .
i don' t buy it .
me and joe go back a long time .
i can tell you definitely , joe didn' t know a thing about this bullshit .
i know joe , and me sayin ' he definitely had nothin ' to do with it is ridiculous .
i can say i definitely didn' t do it , ' cause i know what i did or didn' t do .
but i cannot definitely say that about anybody , ' cause i don' t definitely know .
for all i know , you' re the rat .
for all i know , you' re the fuckin ' rat !
all right , now you' re usin ' your fuckin ' head .
for all we know , he' s the rat .
that kid in there is dying from a fuckin ' bullet i saw him take ... so don' t you be calling him a rat !
look , i' m right , okay ?
somebody' s a fuckin ' rat .
where' s the commode in this dungeon ?
i gotta take a squirt .
go down the hall , make a left , go up the stairs ... and make a right .
by the way , how' s alabama ?
alabama ?
i haven' t seen bama in over a year and a half .
but i thought you two were a team .
we were for a little while .
did about four jobs together , then decided to call it quits .
why ?
you push that woman man thing too long and it gets to you after a while .
what' s she doin ' now ?
she hooked up with frank mcgar .
they' ve done a couple jobs together .
hell of a woman .
good little thief .
so explain the telegram .
five man job .
bustin ' in and bustin ' out of a diamond wholesaler' s .
can you move the ice afterwards ?
i don' t know nobody that can move ice .
no problem .
we got guys waitin ' for it .
what happened to marcellus spivey ?
didn' t he always move your ice ?
he' s doin ' 20 years in susanville .
twenty years ?
holy god .
what for ?
bad luck .
i guess you can say that again .
what' s the exposure like ?
two minutes , tops .
but it' s a tough two minutes .
daylight , during business hours , dealing with a crowd .
but you' il have the guys to deal with the crowd .
how many employees ?
i' d say around 20 .
security pretty lax .
they most usually just deal in boxes .
you know , uncut stones from the diamond syndicate .
but on this day , they' re getting a shipment of polished stones from lsrael .
they' re like a way station , you know ?
they get picked up and sent to vermont .
no , they' re not .
what' s the cut , poppa ?
juicy , junior .
real juicy .
look , man , you do what you want .
i' m outta here , man .
i' m gonna check into a motel for a few days .
you know , i' il lay low and i' il call joe
shit .
did he fuckin ' die on us ?
huh ? ls he dead or what ?
he ain' t dead .
what is it ?
i think he' s just passed out .
he scared the fuckin ' shit outta me .
i thought he was dead for sure .
without medical attention , he will die for sure .
what are we gonna do , man ?
we can' t take him to the hospital .
without medical attention , he might not live through the night .
the bullet in his belly is my fault .
while that might not mean jack shit to you , it means a hell of a lot to me .
first things first , okay ?
stayin ' here' s goofy .
we gotta book up .
so what do you suggest we do ?
go to a hotel ?
we got a guy who' s shot in the belly , who can' t walk , bleeds like a stuck pig .
and when he' s awake , he screams in pain .
you got an idea , spit it out .
joe could help .
if we could get in touch with joe , joe could get him to a doctor .
joe could get a doctor to come to see him .
assuming we can trust joe , how we gonna get in touch with him ?
he' s supposed to be here , but he ain' t , which makes me nervous about bein ' here .
even if he is on the up and up , i don' t think he' s gonna be too happy with us .
he planned a robbery and he' s got a bloodbath on his hands now .
he' s got dead cops , dead robbers , dead civilians .
i tend to doubt he' s gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight .
if i was him , i' d put as much distance between me and this mess as possible .
before you got here , mr. orange ... was askin ' me to take him to a doctor , to a hospital .
i don' t like the idea of turnin ' him over to the cops ... but if we don' t , he' s gonna die .
he begged me to do it .
well , all right .
then i guess we take him to a hospital .
if that' s what he said , let' s do it .
since he don' t know nothin ' about us , i say it' s his decision .
he knows a little about me .
what ?
wait , wait .
you didn' t tell him your name , did you ?
i told him my first name and where i was from .
why ?
i told him where i was from a few days ago .
it was just a natural conversation .
what was tellin ' him your name when you weren' t supposed to ?
he asked .
we had just gotten away from the cops .
he just got shot .
it was my fault he got shot .
he' s a fuckin ' bloody mess .
he' s screamin ' .
i swear to god , i thought he was gonna die right then and there .
i' m tryin ' to comfort him , telling him not to worry ... everything' s going to be okay , i' m gonna take care of him .
and he asked me what my name was .
i mean , the man was dyin ' in my arms .
what the fuck was i supposed to do ?
tell him i' m sorry ?
i can' t give out that fuckin ' information ?
it' s against the rules ?
i don' t trust you enough ?
maybe i should' ve , but i couldn' t .
fuck you !
fuck joe !
i' m sure it was a beautiful scene .
don' t fuckin ' patronize me !
i have one question .
do they have a sheet on you where you' re from ?
yeah !
that' s that , then .
i mean , i was worried about mug shot possibility as it was .
he knows a , your name , b , your face , c , your hometown and d , your specialty .
they' re not gonna have to show him a lot of pictures for him to pick you out !
you didn' t tell him anything else so they could narrow down the selection ?
if i have to tell you again to back off , we' re gonna go ' round and ' round .
we ain' t takin ' him to a hospital .
if we don' t , he' s gonna die .
and i' m very sad about that , but some fellas are lucky and some ain' t .
what the fuck are you touchin ' me for , man ?
i' il show you who you' re fuckin ' with !
you wanna shoot me , you piece of shit ?
i didn' t create this situation , i' m dealin ' with it !
you' re actin ' like a first year thief !
i' m actin ' like a professional !
if they get him , they could get you , they could get closer to me ... and that can' t happen !
you' re lookin ' at me like it' s my fault ?
i didn' t tell him my name !
i didn' t tell him where i was from !
shit !
fifteen minutes ago you almost told me your name !
you' re gonna get stuck in a situation you created !
so if you wanna throw bad looks around , throw ' em at a mirror !
you kids shouldn' t play so rough .
somebody' s gonna start cryin ' .
mr. blonde .
shit .
you' re fuckin ' kickin ' me .
what happened to you ?
figured you were dead .
hey , you okay ?
did you see what happened to blue ?
we didn' t know what happened to you .
that' s what we were wonderin ' about .
look , brown is dead , orange got it in the belly .
enough !
enough !
you better start talkin ' , asshole .
' cause we got shit we need to talk about .
we' re already freaked out .
we need you actin ' freaky like we need a fuckin ' bag on our hip .
okay , let' s talk .
we think we got a rat in the house .
i guarantee we got a rat in the house .
what makes you say that ?
is that supposed to be funny ?
look , we think this place ain' t safe .
this place ain' t secure anymore .
we' re leavin ' and you should go with us .
nobody' s goin ' anywhere .
piss on this fuckin ' turd .
we' re outta here .
don' t take another step , mr. white .
fuck you , maniac !
it' s your fuckin ' fault we' re in this trouble !
what' s this guy' s problem ?
what' s my problem ?
yeah , i got a fuckin ' problem !
i got a big fuckin ' problem ... with any trigger happy madman who almost gets me shot !
what the fuck you talkin ' about ?
that fucking shooting spree !
in the store !
remember ?
oh , fuck ' em .
they set off the alarm .
they deserve what they got .
you almost killed me !
asshole !
if i knew what kind of guy you were , i never would' ve agreed to work with you .
are you gonna bark all day , little doggie ... or are you gonna bite ?
what was that ?
i' m sorry , i didn' t catch it .
would you repeat it ?
are you gonna bark all day , little doggie ... or are you gonna bite ?
you two assholes , calm the fuck down !
hey , come on !

seymour scagnetti .

a fuckin ' jungle bunny goes out there , slits a woman' s throat for 25 cents ... he gets doris day for a parole officer .
a good fella like you winds up with a ball bustin ' prick .
i want you to know i appreciate all the packages you sent me on the inside .

thanks a lot , joe .
ah , vic .

you son of a bitch .
i see you sittin ' there , but i don' t believe it .
how you doin ' , toothpick ?
hey , eddie .

i should' ve picked you up myself .
i was my fuckin ' this week' s been crazy .
i' ve had my head up my ass the whole time .
funny you say that , ' cause that' s what me and your daddy were talkin ' about .
that i should' ve picked you up ?
no , that you had your head up your ass .
i walk in the door , he' s like , " vic , vic ...
i' m so glad somebody' s finally here who knows what' s goin ' on .
my son eddie' s a fuck up .
he' s ruining the business .
i mean , i love the guy , but he' s flushin ' everything down the toilet .
that' s what you said , right , joe ?
tell him yourself .
eddie , i hate for you to hear it like this ... but vic came in and asked me how business was .
you don' t lie to a guy who' s just done four years in the slammer .
that' s very true .
all right , enough of this shit !
break it up !
come on , this ain' t a playground !
you guys wanna roll around on the floor , you do it in eddie' s office , not mine .
daddy , did you see that ?
what ?
the guy got me on the ground , he tried to fuck me .
you wish .
you sick bastard , vic .
you tried to fuck me in my father' s office .
look , vic , whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home ... go to it , but don' t try to fuck me .
i don' t think of you that way .
i like you a lot , buddy , but i don' t think of you that way .
listen , if i was a butt cowboy , i wouldn' t even throw you to the posse .
no , you wouldn' t .
you' d keep me for yourself .
four years fuckin ' punks up the ass , you' d appreciate a piece of prime rib .
i might break you in , nice guy , but i' d make you my dog' s bitch .
ain' t that a sad sight , daddy ?
a man walks into prison a white man , walks out talkin ' like a fuckin ' nigger .
you know what ?
i think it' s all that black semen ... pumped up your asshole , now it' s backed into your fuckin ' brain ... and it' s comin ' out your mouth !
eddie , you keep talkin ' like a bitch , i' m gonna slap you like a bitch .
enough of that shit !
i' m sick of it !
now both of you , sit down .
now , eddie ... when you came in here , we were talkin ' some serious business .
vic here' s got a parole problem .
who' s your p. o. ?
seymour scagnetti .
scagnetti .
fuck .
i hear he' s a motherfucker .
oh , he' s a fucker .
won' t even let me leave the halfway house unless i get some shitty job .
you' re comin ' back to work for us , right ?
well , i wanna .
but first i gotta prove to , uh , ass head ... that i can get a regular , you know , job type job ... before i can move out on my own .
i can' t come back to work for you guys if i gotta worry about , uh ... makin ' some silly ass 10 : 00 curfew ... every fuckin ' night .
we can work this out , can' t we , eddie ?
this ain' t all that bad .
we can get you a lot of legitimate jobs .
i' il get you down in long beach as a dockworker .
i don' t wanna lift no fuckin ' crates , eddie .
you ain' t gonna lift shit .
you don' t even work there .
but as far as the records are concerned , you do .
i call matthews and tell him he' s got a new guy , boom , you' re on the rotation .
you get a time card .
it' s clocked in and out for you every day .
at the end of the week you get a nice paycheck .
dockworkers do very well .
you can move into a halfway decent place without scagnetti goin ' ...
where the fuck' s the money comin ' from ?
and , if he decides to make a surprise visit ... that' s the day we sent you to tustin to pick up a load of shit .
if he comes back again , hey , " sorry , seymour .
you just missed him .
we had to send him to the taft airstrip five fuckin ' hours away .
we had a load of shit he had to pick up there and bring back here .
part of your job is goin ' different places .
that' s the beauty of it .
we got places all over the place .
see , vic ?
did i tell you not to worry ?
vic was worried .
i' il take you to long beach tomorrow .
we' il get you fixed up with matthews , i' il tell him what' s what .
you know , i really appreciate what you guys are doin ' ... but i' d like to know when i can come back ... you know , do some real work .
well , it' s hard to say .
it' s kind of a strange time now .
things are kind of
they' re a little fucked up , is what they are .
we' re just gettin ' ready for a big meetin ' right now in vegas .
look , just let eddie for now set you up at long beach .
get you a job , give you some cash ... and get this scagnetti fuck off your back ... and then we' il talk to you , all right ?
huh ?
dad , i got an idea .
just hear me out .
i know you don' t like usin ' the boys on these jobs ... but vic here i mean , he' s only been nothin ' but good luck for us .
the guy' s a fuckin ' rabbit' s foot , for cryin ' out loud .
i' d like to have him in .
you know he can handle himself , and you damn sure know you can trust him .
all right , vic ... how would you feel about pullin ' a job with about five other guys ?
i' d feel great about it .
k bllly' s " super sounds of the ' 70s " continues .
if you' re the 12th caller ... you' il win two tickets to the monster truck extravaganza ... being held tonight at the carson fairgrounds ... featuring big daddy don bodine' s truck , " the behemoth .
the 12th caller wins on the station where the ' 70s survived .
hey , dov , we got a major situation here .
i know you know that .
i gotta talk to daddy and find out what he wants done .
all i know is what vic told me .
the place turned into a bullet fest .
he took a cop hostage just to get the fuck outta there .
get up !
get up !
do i sound like i' m fuckin ' jokin ' ?
he' s fuckin ' drivin ' around with a cop in his trunk !
i don' t know who did what !
i don' t know who' s got the loot .
i don' t know if anybody' s got the loot .
i don' t know who' s dead , who' s alive , who' s caught , who' s not .
i will know .
i' m practically there now .
but what do i tell these guys about daddy ?

we were set up .
the cops were there waitin ' for us .
what ?
nobody fuckin ' set anybody up .
the cops were there waitin ' for us .
bullshit .
fuck you , man !
you weren' t there , we were , and the cops had that store staked out .
okay , mr. fuckin ' detective , you' re so fuckin ' smart .
who did it ?
we' ve been askin ' each other !
what' d you come up with ?
you think i fuckin ' set you up ?
i don' t know , but somebody did .
nobody did .
you fuckin ' assholes turned the jewelry store
don' t you call me an asshole !
you fuckin ' idiot !
turned the jewelry store into a wild west show ... and you wonder why the fuckin ' cops show up ?
where' s joseph ?
i don' t know .
i ain' t talked to him .
i talked to dov .
he says daddy' s comin ' down here and he' s fuckin ' pissed .
he' s pissed ?
i told you he' d be pissed .
what' d joe say ?
i told you , i ain' t talked to him !
all i know is he' s pissed .
what are you gonna do about him ?
give me a fuckin ' chance to breathe .
i got a few questions of my own here .
you ain' t dying .
he is .
all right , mr. fuckin ' compassion , i will call somebody !
who ?
a fuckin ' snake charmer !
who do you think ?
i' il call a doctor .
they' il fix him right up .
what happened to brown and blue ?
brown' s dead .
we don' t know what happened to blue .
brown' s dead ?
are you sure ?
i' m sure .
i was there .
he took one in the head .
nobody' s got a clue what happened to mr. blue ?
either he' s alive or he' s dead ... or the cops got him or they don' t .
i take it this is the bastard you told me about .
why are you beatin ' on him ?
maybe he could tell us who set us up .
you beat this prick long enough , he' il tell you he started the chicago fire .
now that don' t necessarily make it fuckin ' so !
come on , man , think !
all right , first things fuckin ' last .
who' s got the stones ?
please , somebody tell me one little fuckin ' favor .
i got a bag .
okay ?
i stashed it ' til we could be sure this place wasn' t a police station .
good for you .
now let' s go get it .
first we gotta get rid of those cars .
it looks like sam' s hot car lot outside .
okay .
blondie , stay here and baby sit them two .
white and pink , take a car each .
i' il follow you .
you ditch ' em .
pick up the stones .
while i' m followin ' you , i' il arrange some sort of a doctor for our friend .
you can' t leave these guys here with him .
why not ?
because he' s a fuckin ' psycho .
and if you think joe' s pissed off ... that ain' t nothin ' compared to how pissed off i am at him ... for puttin ' me in the same room as that bastard .
you see what i' ve been puttin ' up with , eddie ?
i fuckin ' walked in here , i told these guys about stayin ' put .
mr. white whips out his gun , he' s stickin ' it in my face ... callin ' me a motherfucker , sayin ' he' s gonna blow me away ... and blah , blah , blah , blah , blah .
he' s the reason the joint turned into a shootin ' spree .
what are you , a fuckin ' silent partner ?
tell him !
he went crazy in the store , but he seems all right now .
this is what he was doin ' : bam , bam ... bam , bam .
yeah , bam , bam , bam , bam , bam .
i told ' em not to touch the fuckin ' alarm , they did .
if they hadn' t have done what i told ' em not to do , they' d still be alive .
my fuckin ' hero .
thanks .
that' s your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage ?
i don' t like alarms , mr. white .
what does it matter who stays with the cop ?
we ain' t lettin ' him go .
he' s seen everybody .
i haven' t been looking at you guys .
shut the fuck up , man !
you guys should never have taken him outta the trunk in the first place .
we tried to find out about the setup .
there is no fuckin ' setup !
now here' s the news !
blondie , you stay here , take care of these two !
white and pink , you come with me , ' cause if joe gets here ... and he sees all these cars parked outside ...
i swear to you he' s gonna be just as mad at me as he is at you .
fine .
let' s go .
alone at last .
guess what .
i think i' m parked in the red zone .
now , where were we ?
i told you , i don' t know anything about any fuckin ' setup .
i' ve been on the force for only eight months .
they don' t tell me anything .
nobody tells me shit .
you can torture me all you want .
torture you ?
that' s a good
that' s a good idea .
i like that one , yeah .
even your boss said there wasn' t a setup .
my what ?
your boss .
excuse me , pal .
i don' t have a boss .
nobody tells me what to do .
you understand ?

all right , all right , all right , you don' t have a boss .
get that fuckin ' shit off .
look , i' m not gonna bullshit you , okay ?
i don' t really give a good fuck what you know or don' t know ... but i' m gonna torture you anyway ... regardless .
not to get information .
it' s amusing to me ... to torture a cop .
you can say anything you want because i' ve heard it all before .
all you can do is ... pray for a quick death ... which ... you ain' t gonna get .
oh , god .
you ever listen to k bllly' s " super sounds of the ' 70s " ?

cabot' s doing a job .
he wants me on the team .
this better not be a joke .
this ain' t a joke .
i' m in .
i' m up his ass .
nice guy eddie tells me joe wants to meet me .
he says i should just wait for a phone call .
after waiting three days he calls me last night and says joe' s ready .
he' il pick me up in 15 minutes .
who picked you up ?
nice guy .

okay , mr. orange .
you ever see this motherfucker before ?
who ?
mr. white ?
yes .
mr. white .

joe knows him good .

you can tell they' re buddies .
you two talk ?
me and joe ?
mr. white .
a little .
about what ?
the brewers .
milwaukee brewers ?
they won the night before .
he made some money off them .
good .
if this crook' s a brewers fan , he' s gotta be from wisconsin .
and i' il bet you everything ... they got a sheet in milwaukee on this mr. white' s ass .
so i want you to go through everybody in milwaukee ... with a history of armed robbery and put a name to the face .
nice work , freddy .
thank you , my man .
how was long beach mike' s referral ?
perfect .
his backing me up went a long way .
i told them i played poker with him .
nice guy checked it out and said it was a okay .
said i was a good thief , i didn' t rattle ... and that i was ready to move .
he' s a good guy .
i wouldn' t be inside without him .
long beach mike is not your friend .
long beach mike is a fucking scumbag .
he' s selling out his friends .
that' s how nice he fuckin ' is .
i' il take care of his ass ... but you get that scumbag out of mind and take care of business .
gone .
use the commode story ?
what' s the commode story ?
it' s a scene .
memorize it .
a what ?
undercover cops gotta be brando .
to do this job you gotta be a great actor , naturalistic .
you gotta be naturalistic as hell .
if you' re a bad actor , that' s bullshit in this job .
what is this ?
that' s an amusing anecdote about a drug deal .
something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job .
i gotta memorize all this ?
there' s four pages of this shit .
think about it like it' s a joke .
memorize what' s important .
the rest you make your own .
you can tell a joke , can' t you ?
well , pretend you' re don rickles ... and tell a joke , all right ?
the things you gotta remember are the details .
the details sell your story .
this particular story takes place in a men' s room .
you gotta know all the details whether they got paper towels or a blower to dry your hands .
you gotta know if the stalls ain' t got no doors or not .
you gotta know if they got liquid soap or that pink , granulated shit ... they used in high school .
you gotta know if they got hot water or not , if it stinks ... if some nasty , lowlife , scum ridden motherfucker ... sprayed diarrhea all over one of the bowls .
you gotta know every detail there is to know about this commode .
what you gotta do is take all them details and make ' em your own .
while you' re doing that , remember that this story is about you ... and how you perceived the events that went down .
the only way to do that ... is keep sayin ' it ... and sayin ' it and sayin ' it .
this is during the l. a. marijuana drought , 1986 .
i still had a connection , which was insane ' cause ... you couldn' t get any weed anywhere then .
anyway , i had a connection with this hippie chick in santa cruz ... and all my friends knew it .
they call me and say , " hey , freddy
i say , " hey , dude .
you gettin ' some ?
can you get some for me too ?
they knew i still smoked , so they asked me to buy some for them .
it got to be
every time i bought some weed i was buyin ' for four or five people .
finally i said , fuck this shit .
i' m makin ' this bitch rich .
she didn' t even have to meet these people .
i was doing all the work .
that got to be a pain in the ass , people calling all the time .
i couldn' t even rent a tape without six fuckin ' interruptions .
when' s the next time you' re gettin ' some ?
motherfucker , i' m tryin ' to watch the lost boys .
when i get some , i' il call you .
then these rink a dink potheads come by .
they' re my friends and everything , but still
i got it laid out in 60 dollar bags , they don' t want 60 dollars worth .
they want ten dollars ' worth , and breaking it up wasn' t easy .
i don' t even know what ten dollars ' worth looks like .
this was a very weird situation .
remember back in ' 86 ... there was a major fuckin ' drought .
nobody had anything .
people were livin ' on resin , smokin ' the wood in their pipes .
this chick had a bunch and she' s beggin ' me to sell it .
so i told her i wasn' t gonna be joe the pot man anymore ... but i would take a little bit and sell it to my close friends .
she agreed and we kept the same arrangement as before ten percent and free pot for me ... if i helped her that weekend .
she was sellin ' a brick of weed and didn' t wanna go to the buy alone .
her brother usually goes with her , but he' s in county unexpectedly .
what for ?
his traffic tickets gone to warrant .
they stopped him , found warrants on him , took him to county .
she doesn' t wanna walk around alone with all that weed .
i don' t wanna do this .
i have a very bad feeling about it .
she keeps asking me , asking me .
finally i said okay ' cause i' m sick of hearing it .
so we go to the train station  wait .
you' re goin ' to the train station with the weed on ya ?
the guy needed it right away .
anyway , we get to the train station ... and we' re waitin ' for the guy .
i' m carryin ' the weed in a carry on bag .
i gotta take a piss , so i tell her i' m goin ' to the boy' s room .
so i walk into the men' s room and who' s standing there ?
four los angeles county sheriffs and a german shepherd .
they' re waitin ' for you ?
no , they' re just talkin ' .
when i walked in , they all stopped talkin ' ... and they looked at me .
that' s hard .
that' s a fuckin ' hard situation .
german shepherd starts barking .
he' s barkin ' at me .
i mean , it' s obvious he' s barkin ' at me .
take off , man .
just bail .
get the fuck outta there .
panic hits me like a bucket of water .
bam !
right in the face .
i' m drenched in panic and these cops are lookin ' at me and they know it .
they can smell it , sure as that fuckin ' dog can .
they can smell it on me .
shut up .
so anyway , i got my gun drawn .
i point it at this guy and i tell him ...
freeze .
don' t fuckin ' move .
this little idiot' s looking right at me and saying ...
i know , i know .
but meanwhile his right hand is creepin ' toward the glove box .
i scream at him , " asshole !
i' m gonna blow you away right now !
put your hands on the dash .
he' s still looking at me , nodding his head .
i know , buddy , i know .
meanwhile his hand is still going for the glove box .
and i said ...
buddy , i' m gonna shoot you in the face ... if you don' t put your hands up .
chuck , what are you doin ' ?
listen to the officer !
put your hands on the dash !
so then the guy snaps out of it and puts his hands on the dash .
what was he goin ' for ?
his fucking registration .
you' re kidding .
no , man !
stupid citizen doesn' t know how close he came to gettin ' blown away .
that close , man .
you knew how to handle that situation .
you shit your pants , dive in and swim .
tell me more about cabot .
i don' t know .
he' s a cool guy .
he' s funny .
he' s a funny guy .
you remember the fantastic four ?
yeah , with that invisible bitch ... and " flame on " and shit , right ?
thing .
motherfucker ...
iooks just like the thing .
hey !
showtime !
grab your jacket .
i' m parked outside .
i' il be right down .
he' il be right down .
don' t pussy out on me now .
they don' t know .
they don' t know shit .
you' re not gonna get hurt .
you' re fuckin ' baretta .
they believe every fuckin ' word ' cause you' re super cool .
there goes our boy .
the guy has to have rocks in his head the size of gibraltar ... to work undercover .
you want one of these ?
yeah , give me the bear claw .
i know what i' m talking about .
black women ain' t the same as white women .
there' s a slight difference .
very funny .
you know what i mean .
what a white bitch will put up with , a black bitch wouldn' t for a minute .
if you cross their line , they fuck you up .
i gotta go along with pink on that .
okay , mr. expert , if this is such a truism ... why is it that every nigger i know treats his woman like a piece of shit ?
i' il bet those same niggers who show their ass in public ... when their bitches get ' em home they chill the fuck out .
not these guys .
oh , yeah .
those guys too .
tell you guys a story .
in one of daddy' s clubs there' s a black cocktail waitress named elois .
elois ?

where was she from ?
compton ?
she' s from ladora heights .
ladora heights .
the black beverly hills .
it' s not the black beverly hills .
it' s the black palos verdes .
anyway ...
lady e , she was a man eater upper .
un fuckin ' believable .
every guy who ever saw her had to jack off to her at least once .
you know who she looked like ?
christie love .
remember that tv show get christie love ... about the black female cop ?
she always used to say , " you' re under arrest , sugar !
who played christie love ?
pam grier .
no , it wasn' t pam grier .
pam grier was the other one .
pam grier did the film .
christie love was like a pam grier tv show without pam grier .
so , who was christie love ?
how should i know ?
great .
now i' m totally fuckin ' tortured .
whoever it was , she looked exactly like elois .
anne francis .
no .
that was honey west .
anne francis is white .
i' m tryin ' to tell a story here .
she looked exactly like elois .
we come into the club one night ... and there' s carlos , the bartender .
he' s a wetback .
he' s a friend of mine .
i says to him , " carlos , where' s lady e tonight ?
apparently lady e ... was married to real piece of dog shit , a real animal .
he used to do things to her .
like what ?
what would he do ?
beat her up ?
i don' t know .
he just did things .
so anyway , one night she plays it real cool .
she waits for him to get drunk .
he falls asleep on the fuckin ' couch .
she sneaks up on him , puts some glue on his dick ... and glues his dick to his belly .
jesus christ !
i' m serious , man .
i' m dead serious .
they had to call the paramedics to cut the prick loose .
was he all pissed off ?
how would you feel if you had to do a fuckin ' handstand to take a piss ?
you guys like to tell jokes and giggle and kid around , huh ?
giggling like a bunch of girls in the schoolyard .
well , let me tell a joke .
five guys sittin ' in a bullpen ...
san quentin ... wonderin ' how the fuck they got there .
what did we do wrong ?
what shouldn' t we have done ?
it' s your fault , his fault
all that bullshit .
finally somebody says ...
wait a minute .
while we were planning this caper ... we just sat around tellin ' fuckin ' jokes .
got the message ?
i don' t mean to holler at ya .
when this caper' s over , and i' m sure it' il be successful ... we' il go down to hawaiian lslands , i' il laugh with all of youse .
find me a different character down there .
right now it' s a matter of business .
with the exception of eddie and myself ... who you already know ... we' re gonna be using aliases on this job .
under no circumstances ... do we want any one of you to relate to each other ... by your christian names .
and i don' t want any talk about yourself personally .
that includes where you been , your wife' s name ... where you might' ve done time ... or a bank maybe you robbed in st. petersburg .
all i want you guys to talk about , if you have to ... is what you' re gonna do .
that should do it .
these are your names
mr. brown , mr. white ...
mr. blonde , mr. blue ...
mr. orange and mr. pink .
why am i mr. pink ?
because you' re a faggot !
all right ?
why can' t we pick our own colors ?
no way .
no way .
tried it once .
it doesn' t work .
you get four guys all fightin ' over who gets to be mr. black .
they don' t know each other , so nobody wants to back down .
no way .
i pick .
you' re mr. pink .
be thankful you' re not mr. yellow .
but mr. brown , that' s too close to mr. shit .
mr. pink sounds like mr. pussy .
how about mr. purple ?
that' s sounds good .
i' il be mr. purple .
you' re not mr. purple .
some guy on some other job is mr. purple .
you' re mr. pink !
who cares what your name is ?
easy for you to say .
you' re mr. white .
you have a cool sounding name .
if it' s no big deal to be mr. pink , you wanna trade ?
nobody' s tradin ' with anybody .
this ain' t a goddamn fuckin ' city council meeting , you know .
now listen up , mr. pink .
there' s two ways you can go on this job my way or the highway .
what' s it gonna be , mr. pink ?
jesus christ , joe .
fuckin ' forget about it .
it' s beneath me .
i' m mr. pink .
let' s move on .
i' il move on when i feel like it .
do all you guys got the goddamn message ?
i' m so goddamn mad hollerin ' at you guys , i can hardly talk .
let' s go to work .
let' s go over it .
where are you ?
i stand outside and guard the door .
i don' t let anybody go in or out .
mr. brown .
he waits in the car .
i give him the signal , he pulls up in front .
mr. blonde and mr. blue .
crowd control .
they handle the customers and the employees .
that girl' s ass .
sittin ' right here on my dick .
myself and mr. pink ?
you two take the manager and make him give you the diamonds .
we' re there for those stones , period .
since no display cases are being fucked with , no alarms should go off .
we' re out in two minutes , not one second longer .
what if the manager won' t give you the diamonds ?
a store like this is insured up the ass .
they' re not supposed to give you any resistance whatsoever .
if you get a customer or an employee who thinks he' s charles bronson ... smash their nose with your gun .
drops him right to the floor .
everyone jumps .
he falls down screaming , blood squirts out of his nose .
freaks everybody out .
nobody says fuckin ' shit after that .
some bitch might talk shit to you .
give her a look like she' s next .
watch her shut the fuck up .
if it' s the manager , that' s different .
the managers know not to fuck around ... so if he' s giving you static ... he probably thinks he' s a real cowboy so you gotta that bastard in two .
if he won' t tell ya something , cut off one of his fingers .
the little one .
then tell him his thumb' s next .
after that he' il tell you if he wears ladies underwear .
i' m hungry .
let' s get a taco .
fuck .
jesus .
i' m blind , man .
i' m fuckin ' blind .
no , you just got blood in your eyes .
is he dead ?
did he die or not ?
let' s go .
hold it !
get out !
get out of the fuckin ' car !
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry , larry .
i can' t believe she killed me .
who' d have fucking thought that ?
hey , just cancel that shit right now .
you' re hurt .
you' re hurt real fuckin ' bad .
but you ain' t dying .
all this blood' s scaring the shit out of me , larry .
i' m gonna die .
i know it .
what the fuck happened ?
he slashed the cop' s face , cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive .
what ?
i didn' t hear you .
i said ...
blonde went crazy .
he slashed the cop' s face , cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive .
this cop ?
he went crazy ?
something like that ?
worse or better ?
eddie , he was pulling a burn , man .
he was gonna kill the cop and me .
when you guys walked in , he was gonna kill you and run with the diamonds .
what' d i tell ya ?
that sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho .
you should' ve asked the cop , not just killed him .
he talked about what he was gonna do when he was slicing him up .
i don' t buy it .
doesn' t make sense .
makes perfect fuckin ' sense to me .
you didn' t see how he acted during the job .
we did .
he' s right .
the ear' s hacked off .
let me just say this out loud , ' cause i wanna get this straight .
you' re saying that mr. blonde ... was gonna kill you ... and then when we got back he was gonna kill us ... take the diamonds and scram .
i' m right about that , right ?
that' s your story ?
i swear on my mother' s soul ... that' s what happened .
the man you killed just got released from prison .
he got caught at a company warehouse full of hot items .
he could' ve fuckin ' walked .
all he had to do was say my dad' s name , but he didn' t ; he kept his mouth shut .
he did his fuckin ' time like a man .
he did four years for us .
so , mr. orange ... you' re telling me that this good friend of mine ... who did four years for my father ... who , in four years , never made a deal , no matter what they offered him ... you' re telling me that now that he' s free ... and we' re making good on our commitment to him ... he' s just gonna decide , out of the fucking blue ... to rip us off ?
why don' t you tell me what really happened .
what the hell for ?
it' d just be more bullshit .
this man set us up .
dad , i' m sorry , but i don' t know what' s happening .
it' s all right .
i do .
what are you talking about ?
that lump of shit' s workin ' with the l. a. p. d.
i don' t have the slightest fucking idea ... what you' re talking about .
joe , i don' t know what you think you know , but you' re wrong .
like hell i am .
trust me on this .
you' ve made a mistake .
he' s a good kid .
i understand you' re super fuckin ' pissed .
we' re all real emotional .
but you' re barking up the wrong tree .
i know him .
he wouldn' t do that .
you don' t know jack shit !
i do .
the cocksucker tipped off the cops ... and got mr. brown and mr. blue killed .
mr. blue is dead ?
dead as dillinger .
how do you know all this ?
he was the only one i wasn' t 100 percent on .
i should have my head examined , going ahead when i wasn' t 100 percent .
that' s your proof ?
with instinct , you don' t need proof .
i ignored it before , but no more .
have you lost your fuckin ' mind ?
i' m not gonna let you make a terrible mistake .
come on , guys .
nobody wants this .
we' re supposed to be fuckin ' professionals .
larry , look ... it' s been quite a long time .
a lot of jobs .
there' s no need for this , man .
let' s just put our guns down ... and let' s settle this ... with a fucking conversation .
joe , if you kill that man , you die next .
repeat : you kill him , you die next .
larry , we have been friends .
you respect my dad and i respect you ... but i' il put bullets in you .
you put that fuckin ' gun down now .
goddamn you , joe ... don' t make me do this .
larry , you stop pointin ' that gun at my dad !
i' m sorry , kid .
looks like we' re gonna ... do a little time .
i' m a cop .
larry ...
i' m sorry .
i' m ... so sorry .
i' m a cop .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
i' m ... sorr
freeze !
drop the fucking gun , buddy !
now !
put the gun down !
don' t do it !
drop the gun , man !
drop the fucking gun !
we' re gonna blow you away !
