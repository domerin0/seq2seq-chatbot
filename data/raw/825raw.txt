the 3000 block of las yegas bouleyard ... ... also known as the bellagio , mirage and mgm grand .
they' re three of the most profitable casinos in las yegas .
this is the bellagio yault , iocated ... ... beneath 200 feet of solld earth .
it safeguards every dime that passes through each of the three casinos .
we' re gonna rob it .
smash and grab job ?
silghtly more compilcated than that .
well , yeah .
this is courtesy of frank catton , a new dealer at the bellagio .
bad news first .
this place houses a security system riyallng most nuclear silos .
first , we have to get in the casino cages , which takes more than a smile .
next , through these doors ... ... each one requiring a different code changed every 1 2 hours .
past those , the eleyator .
here' s where it gets tricky .
it won' t move without fingerprint i. d. which we can' t fake .
and yocal confirmation from the system within the bellagio and the yault .
which we won' t get .
the eleyator shaft is rigged with sensors .
if we override the llft , the exit would iock and we' d be trapped .
once we get down the shaft , it' s a piece of cake .
just two more guards with uzis ... ... and the most elaborate yault door eyer conceiyed .
any questions ?
tunnellng' s out .
there are ... ... sensors monitoring the ground .
if a groundhog nested , they' d know .
anyone else ?
you mentioned good news ?
yeah .
the neyada gaming commission requires ... ... a casino to keep enough cash to cover every chip in play on the floor .
that means on a weekday it must carry ... ... between $60 and $70 million in cash and coin .
on the weekend , between 80 and 90 million .
on a fight night ... ... like in two weeks , the night we' re robbing it ... ... $1 50 million , without breaking a sweat .
there are 11 of us , each with an equal share .
you do the math .
exactly .
i have a question .
say we get into the cage and through the security doors ... ... down the eleyator we can' t move ... ... past the guards with the guns , into the yault we can' t open
and not seen by cameras .
sorry , i forgot to mention that .
yeah , well , say we do all that ... ... we' re just supposed to walk out of there with $1 50 million ... ... without getting stopped ?
yeah .
oh .
okay .
first task : reconnalssance .
i want to know what goes on ... ... in all casinos , from the dealers ' rotation ... ... to the path ofcash carts .
i want to know everything about every guard .

he speaks spanish , german and italian and is getting good at japanese .
he ' s out by 7 : 30 and is handed a black portfollo .
contents : profits and new security codes .
he heads to the restaurant .
like i said , a machine .
that portfollo contalns codes to all the cage doors ?
and two minutes after they' re changed , he' s got them .
you guys really can pick them .
this guy' s as smart as he is ruthless .
last guy he caught cheating , he not only sent up for 10 years ... ... he seized his house and bankrupted his

there' s a confilct of interest when you ...
... giye me adyice about my love life .
but that doesn' t mean i' m wrong .
do you remember what i said when we first met ?
that i better know what i' m doing .
do you ?
now ?
you should go if you don' t .
i know what i' m doing .
what are you doing ?
just catching up .

danny ocean .
mr. ocean .
i' m in your seat .
forgiye my iateness .
a guest required my attention .
that' s fine .
danny was walking through and spotted me .
is that so ?
imagine the odds .
of all the gin joints in all the world .
you recently were released from prison ?
that' s right .
how does it feei to be out ?
about the same .
danny was just about to  i just stopped by to say hi to tess .
stay , have a drink .
i can' t .
he can' t .
well , then ....
i imagine we won' t see mr. ocean anytime soon .
you neyer know .
i know everything happening in my hotels .
so i should put those towels back .
no , the towels you can keep .
good to see you , tess .
take care , danny .
terry .
danny .
stinking ....
tomorrow the day is yours .
call is at 5 : 30 , makeup and costume .
saul' s package arriyes at 7 : 05 .
linus grabs our codes .
all goes well , we' re a go .
at 7 : 30 , yen is iocked in and we' re committed .
from this point , we have 30 minutes to blow the power or he suffocates .
once the electricity goes , access to the yault ... ... and its eleyator shut down for two minutes .
that' s when we go .
you' re in the middle of the room , 10 feet from everything .
you have to get to the door without touching the floor .
what do you do ?
ten says he shorts it .
twenty .
window or alsle , boys ?
yeah , we' re in deep shit .
that poxy demo crew didn' t back the maln llne .
they naused up the malnframe .
naused it up !
you understand him ?
i' il explaln iater .
they' re so pony they blew the backup grids one by one .
basher , what happened ?
they did what i would have done but by accident .
now they know their weakness , they' re filxing it .
so unless we intend to do this job in reno , we' re in barney .
barney rubble .
trouble !
we could always  by tomorrow ?
hang on a minute , hang on .
we could use a pinch .
what' s a pinch ?
a deyice which creates a cardiac arrest for broadband circuitry .
better yet , a pinch is a bomb without the bomb .
when a nuclear weapon detonates , its electromagnetic pulse ... ... shuts down any power source within its blast radlus .
it usually doesn' t matter because a nuclear weapon destroys everything .
a pinch creates a similar electromagnetic pulse ... ... without mass destruction and death .
instead of hiroshima you get ...
... the 1 7th century .
how iong ?
30 seconds . could a pinch knock out the power of an entire city ?
like , for instance  las yegas ?
yeah , i think it might .
there' s only one pinch big enough to do it .
