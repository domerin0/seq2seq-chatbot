hi .
i' ve got an appointment with mr. ullman .
my name is jack torrance .
his office is the first door on the left .
thank you .
mr. ullman ?
i' m jack torrance .
come on in , jack .
very nice to meet you .
nice to meet you .
this is my secretary , susie .
susie , how do you do ?
any trouble finding us ?
no problem at all .
i made the trip in 3 1/ 2 hours .
that' s very good time .
sit down a minute , jack .
just make yourself at home .
like some coffee ?
if you' re having some , i wouldn' t mind .
thanks .
susie .
sure .
and ask bill watson to join us .
yes , i will .
mom ?
yeah ?
do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter ?
sure i do .
it' il be lots of fun .
yeah .
i guess so .
anyway , there' s hardly anybody to play with around here .
i know .
it always takes a little time to make new friends .
yeah , i guess so .
what about tony ?
he' s looking forward to the hotel , i bet .
no , i ain' t , mrs. torrance .
now , come on , tony .
don' t be silly .
i don' t want to go there .
how come you don' t want to go ?
i just don' t .
let' s just wait and see .
we' re all going to have a real good time .
bill , i' d like you to meet jack torrance .
how do you do , bill ?
nice to meet you .
pleasure to meet you .
grab a chair , bill .
join in .
jack is going to take care of the overlook for us this winter .
i' d like you to take him around soon as we' re through .
fine .
jack is a schoolteacher .
formerly a schoolteacher .
what line of work are you in now ?
i' m a writer .
teaching' s been more or less a way of making ends meet .
this ought to be quite a change for you .
i' m looking for a change .
our people in denver recommended jack very highly , and for once ... ... l agree with them .
let' s see , where were we ?
i was about to explain ... ... that our season here runs from may 15th to october 30th .
then we close down completely until the following may .
do you mind if i ask why you do that ?
it seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic .
it would be .
the problem is the enormous cost ... ... it would be to keep the road to sidewinder open .
it' s a 25 mile stretch of road .
it gets 20 feet of snow during the winter .
there' s just no way to make it economically feasible ... ... to keep it clear .
when the place was built in 1907 ... ... there was very little interest in winter sports .
this site was chosen for its seclusion and scenic beauty .
it' s certainly got plenty of that .
that' s right .
did they give you any idea in denver ... ... about what the job entails ?
only in a very general way .
the winters can be fantastically cruel .
the basic idea is to cope with the very costly damage ... ... and depreciation which can occur .
this consists mainly of running the boiler ... ... heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis ... ... repairing damage as it occurs ... ... and doing repairs so the elements can' t get a foothold .
that sounds fine to me .
physically , it' s not a very demanding job .
the only thing that can get a bit trying here during the winter ... ... is a tremendous sense of isolation .
that just happens to be exactly what i' m looking for .
i' m outlining a new writing project .
five months of peace is just what i want .
that' s very good , jack .
because , for some people ... ... solitude ... ... and isolation ... ... can , of itself , become a problem .
not for me .
how about your wife and son ?
do you think they' il take to it ?
they' il love it .
great .
before i turn you over to bill ... ... there' s one other thing i think we should talk about .
not to sound melodramatic ... ... but it' s been known to give a few people ... ... second thoughts about the job .
i' m intrigued .
i don' t suppose they said anything in denver ... ... about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970 .
i don' t believe they did .
my predecessor in this job ... ... hired a man named charles grady as the winter caretaker .
he came up with his wife and 2 little girls of about 8 and 10 .
he had a good employment record , good references .
and from what i' ve been told , he seemed ... ... like a completely normal individual .
but at some point during the winter ... ... he must have suffered some kind of a complete mental breakdown .
he ran amuck ...
... and killed his family with an ax .
stacked them neatly in a room in the west wing , and then ... ... he put both barrels of his shotgun in his mouth .
the police thought ... ... that it was what the old timers used to call cabin fever .
a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur ... ... when people are shut in together over long periods of time .
that is ... ... quite a story .
yeah , it is .
it' s still hard for me to believe it actually happened here .
but it did .
i think you can appreciate why i wanted to tell you about it .
i certainly can .
i also understand why your people in denver ... ... left it for you to tell me .
obviously , some people can be put off ... ... from staying in a place where something like that happened .
you can rest assured that' s not going to happen with me .
and as far as my wife is concerned ... ... l' m sure she' il be absolutely fascinated when i tell her .
she' s a confirmed ghost story ... ... and horror film addict .
tony , do you think dad' il get the job ?
he already did .
he' s going to phone wendy up in a few minutes to tell her .
hi , babe .
hi , hon .
how' s it going ?
great .
i' m at the hotel and i still have a lot to go through .
i don' t think i can get home before 9 or 10 .
sounds like you got the job .
right .
it' s a beautiful place .
you and danny are going to love it .
tony , why don' t you want to go to the hotel ?
i don' t know .
you do too know .
now come on , tell me .
i don' t want to .
please .
no .
now , tony , tell me .
now , hold your eyes still so i can see .
that' s good .
now the other one .
good boy .
now , danny ... ... when you were brushing your teeth ... ... do you remember if you smelled anything funny ... ... or saw any bright , flashing lights or anything at all strange ?
no .
do you remember when you were brushing your teeth ?
yes .
what' s the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth ?
my mom was saying , " wake up .
wake up , danny , wake up .
can you remember what you were doing ... ... just before you started brushing your teeth ?
talking to tony .
is tony one of your animals ?
no .
he' s a little boy that lives in my mouth .
tony' s his imaginary friend .
if you were to open your mouth now , could i see tony ?
why not ?
because he hides .
where does he go ?
to my stomach .
does tony ever tell you to do things ?
i don' t want to talk about tony anymore .
that' s fine .
all right , danny .
i' m going to ask you to do me a favor ... ... and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day .
okay ?
do i have to ?
yes .
i' d like you to .
we' re going in the other room for a few minutes and talk .
i' il come back and check on you .
shall we go into the living room ?
yes .
please .
thank you .
mrs. torrance , i don' t think you have anything to worry about .
i' m quite sure there' s nothing physically wrong with danny .
he seems absolutely fine now .
but you should' ve seen him .
i know .
kids can scare you to death .
but believe me , these episodes are not at all uncommon .
and they look much worse than they are .
but what was the matter with him ?
most of the time , these episodes with kids are never explained .
they' re brought on by emotional factors and rarely occur again .
they' re more akin to autohypnosis ... ... a kind of self induced trance .
if it reoccurs , which i doubt ... ... we can always think about having some tests done .
i' m sure you' re right .
have you been in boulder long ?
only about three months .
we' re from vermont .
my husband was teaching school there .
did the appearance of danny' s imaginary friend ....
tony .
did tony' s first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here ?
let' s see ....
i guess danny started talking to tony ... ... about the time we put him in nursery school .
did he adjust well to school ?
he didn' t like it too much at first .
then he had an injury , so we kept him out for a while and ....
i guess that' s about when i first noticed he was talking to tony .
what sort of injury did he have ?
he dislocated his shoulder .
how did he manage to do that ?
it was just one of those things , you know .
purely an accident .
my husband had been drinking ... ... and he came home about three hours late .
so he wasn' t exactly in the greatest mood that night .
and danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room ... ... and my husband grabbed his arm to pull him away from them .
it' s just the sort of thing you do 100 times with a child ... ... you know , in a park or in the street .
but on this particular occasion ... ... my husband just used too much strength ... ... and he injured danny' s arm .
anyway , something good did come out of it all because he said ... ... " wendy , i' m never going to touch another drop .
and if i do , you can leave me .
and he didn' t .
he hasn' t had any alcohol in 5 months .
we must really be high up .
the air feels so different .
dad ?
i' m hungry .
you should' ve eaten your breakfast .
we' il get you something as soon as we get to the hotel .
okay , mom .
wasn' t it around here that the donner party got snowbound ?
i think that was farther west , in the sierras .
what was the donner party ?
they were a party of settlers in covered wagon times .
they got snowbound one winter in the mountains .
they had to resort to cannibalism in order to stay alive .
you mean they ate each other up ?
they had to in order to survive .
jack .
don' t worry , mom .
i know all about cannibalism .
i saw it on tv .
see , it' s okay .
he saw it all on the television .
what time does the plane leave ?
8 : 30 .
that gives us plenty of time to go over everything .
goodbye , mr. ullman .
bye .
good morning .
i hope you haven' t been waiting too long .
no problem .
we had time to grab a bite to eat .
good .
glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen .
is your family having a look around ?
no , my son' s discovered the games room .
has your luggage been brought in ?
right there .
in view of all we have to cover today ... ... l suggest we have a quick look at your apartment and get started .
have the torrances ' things brought to their apartment .
i' d better collect my family first .
this is our colorado lounge .
it' s beautiful .
my god !
this place is fantastic , isn' t it , hon ?
it sure is .
i' ve never seen anything like this before .
are all these lndian designs authentic ?
i believe they' re based ... ... mainly on navajo and apache motifs .
they' re really gorgeous .
as a matter of fact ... ... this is probably the most gorgeous hotel i' ve ever seen .
this old place has had an illustrious past .
in its heyday , it was a stopping place for the jet setters ... ... even before anybody knew what a jet set was .
we had four presidents who stayed here .
lots of movie stars .
royalty ?
all the best people .
this is the staff wing of the hotel .
none of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter .
goodbye , mr. ullman .
goodbye , girls .
and here are your quarters .
living room , bedroom , bathroom .
and a small bedroom for your son .
perfect for a child .
well , then .
place is very nicely self contained .
easy to keep .
cozy .
yes , very cozy for a family .
if you feel like spreading out ... ... you have the rest of the hotel to move around in .
well , it' s very ... ... homey .
this is our famous hedge maze .
it' s quite an attraction here .
the walls are 13 feet high ... ... and the hedge is as old as the hotel itself .
a lot of fun , but i wouldn' t want to go in there ... ... unless i had an hour to spare to find my way out .
when was the overlook built ?
construction started in 1907 .
it was finished in 1909 .
the site' s supposed to be on an lndian burial ground .
they actually had to repel ... ... a few lndian attacks as they were building it .
that' s our snowcat .
can you both drive a car ?
that' s fine .
basically the snowcat operates very much like a car .
it won' t take you long to get the hang of it .
as a matter of fact , we brought a decorator in from chicago ... ... just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel .
he sure did a beautiful job .
pink and gold are my favorite colors .
this is our gold ballroom .
i' il say !
we can accommodate up to 300 people here very comfortably .
boy , we could really have a good party in this room .
i' m afraid you won' t do too well here unless you brought supplies .
we remove the booze from the premises when we shut down .
that reduces the insurance we normally have to carry .
we don' t drink .
then you' re in luck .
dick , come on over and say hello to mr. and mrs. torrance .
this is dick hallorann , our head chef .
mr. hallorann , i' m jack .
this is my wife , winifred .
glad to meet you .
the torrances will take care of the overlook this winter .
that' s just great .
how do you folks like our hotel so far ?
it' s just wonderful .
hi , danny !
i found him outside looking for you .
did you get tired of bombing the universe ?
come on over here .
thank you , susie .
i think it' d be good if you could show mrs. torrance the kitchen ... ... while i continue on with jack .
it would be a pleasure .
right this way .
great .
see you later , hon .
bye , darling .
mrs. torrance , your husband introduced you as winifred .
now , are you a " winnie , " or a " freddie " ?
i' m a wendy .
wendy .
that' s nice .
that' s the prettiest .
this is the kitchen , huh ?
this is it .
how do you like it , danny ?
ls it big enough for you ?
it' s the biggest place i ever seen .
this whole place is such an enormous maze .
i' il have to leave a trail of breadcrumbs every time i come in .
don' t let it get you down .
it' s big , but it ain' t nothing but a kitchen .
a lot of this stuff you' il never have to touch .
i wouldn' t know what to do with it if i did .
one thing for sure , you don' t have to worry about food .
you folks could eat here for a year and never have the same menu twice .
right here is our walk in freezer .
this is where we keep all of our meat .
you got 15 rib roasts ... ... 30 ten pound bags of hamburger .
we got 12 turkeys , about 40 chickens ... ... 50 sirloin steaks , two dozen of pork roast ... ... and 20 legs of lamb .
do you like lamb , doc ?
you don' t ?
what' s your favorite food , then ?
french fries and ketchup .
i think we can manage that too , doc .
come along , now .
watch your step .
how' d you know we call him doc ?
beg your pardon ?
doc .
you called danny " doc " twice .
i did ?
we call him doc sometimes , like in the bugs bunny cartoons .
but how did you know ?
i guess i probably heard you call him that .
it' s possible .
but i honestly don' t remember ... ... calling him that since we' ve been with you .
anyway , he looks like a doc , doesn' t he ?
what' s up , doc ?
now , this is the storeroom .
in here is where we keep ... ... all the dried goods and the canned goods .
we got canned fruits and vegetables ... ... canned fish and meats , hot and cold cereals .
post toasties , corn flakes , sugar puffs ... ... rice ikrispies , oatmeal , wheatena and cream of wheat .
you got a dozen jugs of black molasses .
we got 60 boxes of dried milk ...
how' d you like some ice cream , doc ?
sociables , finger rolls ... ... and 7 kinds of what have you .
now , we' ve got dried peaches , dried apricots ... ... dried raisins and dried prunes .
you know , you got to keep regular if you want to be happy .
how' re you getting on ?
fine .
can we borrow mrs. torrance ?
we' re on our way to the basement .
i promise we won' t keep her very long .
no problem , mr. ullman .
i was just getting to the ice cream .
you like ice cream , doc ?
i thought you did .
you folks mind if i give danny some ice cream while we wait ?
not at all .
we don' t mind .
good .
sound good to you , doc ?
okay , you behave yourself .
what kind of ice cream do you like ?
chocolate .
chocolate it shall be .
come on , son .
it' s amazing , all this activity today .
the guests and some staff left yesterday , but the ... ... last day' s always hectic .
everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible .
by 5 : 00 tonight , you' il never know anybody was ever here .
just like a ghost ship , huh ?
do you know how i knew your name was doc ?
you know what i' m talking about , don' t you ?
i can remember when i was a little boy ... ... my grandmother and i could hold conversations ... ... entirely without ever opening our mouths .
she called it " shining .
and for a long time i thought it was just the two of us ... ... that had " the shine " to us .
just like you probably thought you was the only one .
but there are other folks ... ... though mostly they don' t know it , or don' t believe it .
how long have you been able to do it ?
why don' t you want to talk about it ?
i' m not supposed to .
who says you ain' t supposed to ?
tony .
who' s tony ?
tony' s the little boy that lives in my mouth .
is tony the one that ... ... tells you things ?
how does he tell you things ?
it' s like i go to sleep , and he shows me things .
but when i wake up , i can' t remember everything .
does your mom and dad know about tony ?
do they know he tells you things ?
tony told me never to tell them .
has tony ever told you anything about this place ?
about the overlook hotel ?
i don' t know .
now think real hard , doc .
think .
maybe he showed me something .
try to think of what it was .
mr. hallorann , are you scared of this place ?
scared of nothing here .
it' s just that ... ... you know , some places are like people .
some shine ... ... and some don' t .
i guess you could say the overlook hotel ... ... has something about it that' s like shining .
is there something bad here ?
you know , doc , when something happens ... ... it can leave a trace of itself behind .
say , like ... ... if someone burns toast .
maybe things that happen leave other kind of traces behind .
not things that anyone can notice .
but things that people who shine can see .
just like they can see things that haven' t happened yet ... ... sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago .
i think a lot of things happened right here ... ... in this particular hotel over the years .
and not all of them was good .
what about room 237 ?
room 237 ?
you' re scared of room 237 , ain' t you ?
no , i ain' t .
mr. hallorann , what is in room 237 ?
nothing .
there ain' t nothing in room 237 .
but you ain' t got no business going in there anyway .
so stay out .
you understand ?
stay out !
good morning , hon .
your breakfast is ready .
what time is it ?
it' s about 11 : 30 .
jesus .
i guess we' ve been staying up too late .
i know it .
i made them just the way you like them , sunny side up .
nice .
it' s really pretty outside .
how about taking me for a walk after you finish your breakfast ?
i suppose i ought to try to do some writing first .
any ideas yet ?
lots of ideas .
no good ones .
something will come .
it' s just a matter of settling into the habit of writing every day .
that' s all it is .
it' s really nice up here , isn' t it ?
i love it .
i really do .
i' ve never been this happy or comfortable anywhere .
it' s amazing how fast you get used to such a big place .
i tell you , when we first came up here ... ... l thought it was kind of scary .
i fell in love with it right away .
when i came up here for my interview ... ... it was as though i' d been here before .
i mean , we all have moments of deja vu ... ... but this was ridiculous .
it was almost as though i knew ... ... what was going to be around every corner .
the loser has to keep america clean .
how' s that ?
all right .
and you' re going to lose .
and i' m going to get you .
you' d better run fast !
look out !
i' m coming in close .
loser has to keep america clean .
keep america clean .
danny , you win .
let' s take the rest of this walking .
give me your hand .
isn' t it beautiful ?
dead end .
we made it .
isn' t it beautiful ?
it' s so pretty .
i didn' t think it was going to be this big .
did you ?
rutherford was serving a life sentence ... ... for a 1968 shooting .
and the search continues for that missing aspen woman .
24 year old susan robertson has been missing 10 days .
she disappeared on a hunting trip with her husband .
they may have to call off the search ... ... if a predicted snowstorm moves in tomorrow .
it' s so beautiful in denver today ... ... it' s hard to believe a snowstorm could be close .
i want to go outside and lie in the sun ... ... yet to our north , to our west , it is snowing and cold .
and it' s moving ... ... right here towards colorado as we talk .
it' s incredible .
hi , hon .
how' s it going ?
fine .
get a lot written today ?
the weather forecast said it' s going to snow tonight .
what do you want me to do about it ?
come on , hon .
don' t be so grouchy .
i' m not ... ... being grouchy .
i just want to finish my work .
okay .
i understand .
i' il come back later with a couple of sandwiches .
maybe you' il let me read something then .
wendy ... ... let me explain something to you .
when you come in and interrupt , you' re breaking my concentration .
you' re distracting me ... ... and it will then take me time to get back to where i was .
understand ?
fine .
whenever i' m in here ... ... and you hear me typing ... ... or whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here ... ... when i' m in here , that means i am working .
that means don' t come in .
now , do you think you can handle that ?
fine .
why don' t you start right now and get the fuck out of here ?
all right , you !
i know you' ve got more .
missed !
don' t have !
no fair anymore .
i knew it .
this is kdk 12 calling kdk 1 .
kdk 12 to kdk 1 .
this is kdk 1 .
we' re receiving you .
over .
hi , this is wendy torrance at the overlook hotel .
hi , how are you folks getting on up there ?
over .
we' re just fine .
but our telephones aren' t doing too well .
are the lines down , by any chance ?
over .
yes , quite a few of them are down due to the storm .
over .
any chance of them being repaired soon ?
over .
well , i wouldn' t like to say .
most winters they stay that way until spring .
over .
boy , this storm is really something , isn' t it ?
over .
yes .
it' s one of the worst we' ve had for years .
is there anything else we can do for you , mrs. torrance ?
i suppose not .
over .
if you folks have any problems up there , just give us a call .
and , mrs. torrance ?
it might be a good idea if you leave your radio on all the time .
okay .
we' il do that .
it was real nice talking to you .
bye .
over and out .
hello , danny .
come and play with us .
come and play with us , danny .
forever ... ... and ever ... ... and ever .
tony ... ... l' m scared .
remember what mr. hallorann said .
it' s just like pictures in a book , danny .
it isn' t real .
please let me give you some money .
i wouldn' t think of it .
well , how can i repay you ?
it' s okay .
really .
well , i' m going to have some coffee .
would you like some ?
sure .
great .
sit down .
marvelous doughnuts .
help yourself .
coffee will be ready in a few minutes .

daddy' s asleep .
i won' t make any noise .
now come on , doc .
he only went to bed a few hours ago .
can' t you wait till later ?
i won' t make a sound .
i promise i' il tiptoe .

but really don' t make a sound .
i won' t , mom .
make sure you come right back ... ... because i' m going to make lunch soon .
okay , mom .
can i go to my room and get my fire engine ?
come here for a minute first .
how' s it going , doc ?

yes , dad .
good .
i want you to have a good time .
i am , dad .
do you feel bad ?
i' m just a little bit tired .
then why don' t you go to sleep ?
i can' t .
i got too much to do .
do you like this hotel ?
i do .
i love it .
don' t you ?
i guess so .
good .
i want you to like it here .
i wish we could stay here forever ... ... and ever ... ... and ever .
what ?
you would never hurt mommy or me , would you ?
what do you mean ?
did your mother ever say that to you ?
that i would hurt you ?
no , dad .
you sure ?
yes , dad .
i love you , danny .
i love you more than anything else ... ... in the whole world ... ... and i would never do anything to hurt you ... ... never .
you know that , don' t you ?
yes , dad .
good .
mom , are you in there ?
what happened ?
honey ... ... what' s wrong ?
i had the most ... ... terrible nightmare i ever had .
it was the most horrible dream .
it' s okay , it' s okay now .
really .
i dreamed that i ... ... that i killed you and danny .
but i didn' t just kill you .
i cut you up into little pieces .
my god .
i must be losing my mind .
everything' s going to be all right .
come on .
let' s get up off the floor .
there .
now sit up .
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
danny !
everything' s okay !
just go play in your room for a while .
your dad' s just got a headache .
danny , mind what i say .
go play in your room .
honey , let me just go get him out of here .
i' il be right back .
why don' t you mind me ?
oh , my god .
what happened to your neck ?
what happened to your neck ?
you did this to him ... ... didn' t you ? !
you son of a bitch !
you did this to him !
didn' t you ? !
how could you ? !
how could you ? !
god !
i' d give anything for a drink .
i' d give my goddamn soul ... ... for just a glass of beer .
hi , lloyd .
a little slow tonight , isn' t it ?
yes it is , mr. torrance .
what will it be ?
i' m awfully glad you asked me that , lloyd ... ... because i just happen to have two twenties ... ... and two tens right here in my wallet .
i was afraid they were going to be there until next april .
you slip me a bottle of bourbon ... ... a little glass and some ice .
you can do that , can' t you , lloyd ?
you' re not too busy , are you ?
no , sir .
i' m not busy at all .
good man .
you set them up ... ... and i' il knock them back , one by one .
white man' s burden , lloyd , my man .
white man' s burden .
say , lloyd ... ... it seems i' m temporarily light .
how' s my credit in this joint , anyway ?
your credit' s fine , mr. torrance .
that' s swell .
i like you , lloyd .
i always liked you .
you were always the best of them .
best goddamned bartender ... ... from timbuktu to portland , maine .
or portland , oregon , for that matter .
thank you for saying so .
here' s to 5 miserable months on the wagon ... ... and all the irreparable harm that it' s caused me .
how are things going , mr. torrance ?
things could be better .
things could be a whole lot better .
i hope it' s nothing serious .
nothing serious .
just a little problem with ... ... the old sperm bank upstairs .
nothing i can' t handle , though .
thanks .
women .
can' t live with them ... ... can' t live without them .
words of wisdom , lloyd .
words of ... ... wisdom .
i never laid a hand on him , goddamn it .
i didn' t .
i wouldn' t touch one hair on his goddamn little head .
i love the little son of a bitch .
i' d do anything for him .
any fucking thing for him .
but that bitch !
as long as i live ... ... she' il never let me forget what happened .
i did hurt him once , okay ?
it was an accident .
completely unintentional .
it could have happened to anybody .
and it was three goddamn years ago !
the little fucker had thrown all my papers all over the floor .
all i tried to do was pull him up .
a momentary loss of muscular coordination .
i mean ... ... a few extra foot pounds of energy ... ... per second , per second .
thank god you' re here .
there' s someone else in the hotel with us .
there' s a crazy woman in one of the rooms .
she tried to strangle danny .
are you out of your fucking mind ?
it' s the truth !
really .
i swear it .
danny told me .
he went up into one of the bedrooms .
the door was open , and he saw this crazy woman in the bathtub .
she tried to strangle him !
which room was it ?
from channel 10 in miami ... ... this is newswatch with glen rinker ... ... ann bishop , and the award winning newswatch team .
good evening .
i' m glen rinker , newswatch ten .
as miami continues to swelter in a record winter heat wave ... ... bringing temperatures to the 90s ... ... central and mountain states are buried in snow .
in colorado , 10 inches of snow fell in just a few hours tonight .
travel in the rockies is almost impossible .
airports are shut down , stranding thousands of passengers .
highways are blocked by snowdrifts .
railroad tracks are frozen .
officials in colorado tell newswatch ... ... at least 3 have been killed by exposure to freezing winds .
the governor of colorado is expected ... ... to declare a weather emergency .
the national guard might be called out ... ... to clear streets and roads .
weather forecasters predict more snow ... ... and heavy winds tonight and tomorrow ... ... with temperatures dropping well below zero .
back here in florida , we' ve got the opposite problem .
the heat and humidity are supposed to climb .
local beaches should be jammed .
our weather expert , walter cronice ... ... will have the local forecast later on newswatch .
we' re sorry .
your call cannot be completed as dialed .
if you need assistance , please call the operator .
yes , it' s me .
thank god .
did you find anything ?
no .
nothing at all .
i didn' t see one goddamn thing .
you went into the room danny said ?
to 237 ?
yes , i did .
and you didn' t see anything at all ?
absolutely nothing .
how is he ?
he' s still asleep .
good .
i' m sure he' il be himself again in the morning .
are you sure it was the right room ?
i mean , maybe danny made a mistake .
he must have gone in that room .
the door was open , the lights were on .
i just don' t understand it .
what about those bruises on his neck ?
somebody did that to him .
i think ... ... he did it to himself .
no .
that' s not possible .
once you rule out his version of what happened ... ... there is no other explanation .
is there ?
it wouldn' t be that different from the episode ... ... that he had before we came up here .
would it ?
whatever the explanation is ...
... l think we ... ... have to get danny out of here .
get him out of here ?
you mean ... ... just leave the hotel ?
it is so ... ... typical of you to create a problem like this ... ... when i finally have a chance to accomplish something !
when i' m really into my work !
i could really write my own ticket if i went back now , couldn' t l ?
shoveling out driveways , work in a car wash .
any of that appeal to you ?
i have let you fuck up my life so far ... ... but i am not going to let you fuck this up .
good evening .
forest service .
my name is dick hallorann .
i' m the head chef at the overlook hotel .
good evening .
what can i do for you ?
i' ve been trying to make an urgent phone call up there ... ... but the operator said that the phone lines are down .
a lot of lines around here are down due to the storm .
i hate to put you through any trouble ... ... but there' s a family up there all by themselves with a young kid .
and with this storm and everything ... ... l' d appreciate it if you' d give them a call on your radio ... ... just to see if everything' s okay .
i' il be glad to do that .
why don' t you call me back in about 20 minutes ?
thank you very much .
i' il do that .
all right , sir .
good evening , mr. torrance .
good evening .
hi , lloyd .
been away , but now i' m back .
good evening , mr. torrance .
it' s good to see you .
it' s good to be back , lloyd .
what' il it be , sir ?
hair of the dog that bit me .
bourbon on the rocks .
that' il do her .
no charge to you , mr. torrance .
no charge ?
your money' s no good here .
orders from the house .
orders from the house .
drink up , mr. torrance .
i' m the kind of man likes to know who' s buying their drinks , lloyd .
it' s not a matter that concerns you , mr. torrance .
at least , not at this point .
anything you say , lloyd .
anything you say .
oh , dear !
i' m so sorry , sir .
oh , dear .
oh , dear .
i' ve made an awful mess of your jacket , sir .
that' s all right .
i' ve got plenty of jackets .
i' m afraid it' s advocaat , sir .
it tends to stain .
advocaat , is it ?
yes , sir .
i think the best thing ... ... is to come along to the gentlemen' s room ... ... and we' il get some water to it , sir .
looks like you might have got a spot of it on yourself ... ... jeevesy old boy .
that doesn' t matter , sir .
you' re the important one .
awfully nice of you to say .
of course , i intended to change my jacket this evening ... ... before the fish and goose soiree .
very wise , sir .
very wise .
here .
i' il just ... ... hold this for you there , jeevesy .
thank you , sir .
thank you .
let' s see if we can improve this with a little water , sir .
all right .
i' il just ... ... set my bourbon and advocaat down right there .
won' t keep you a moment .
fine .
what do they call you , jeevesy ?
grady , sir .
delbert grady .
grady ?
yes , sir .
delbert grady .
that' s right , sir .
mr. grady ... ... haven' t i seen you somewhere before ?
why , no , sir .
i don' t believe so .
it' s coming off now , sir .
mr. grady ... ... weren' t you once the caretaker here ?
why , no , sir .
i don' t believe so .
you a married man , are you , mr. grady ?
yes , sir .
i have a wife and two daughters , sir .
and ... ... where are they now ?
they' re somewhere around .
i' m not quite sure at the moment .
you were the caretaker here .
i recognize you .
i saw your picture in the newspapers .
you ... ... chopped your wife and daughter up into little bits .
and ... ... then you blew your brains out .
that' s strange , sir .
i don' t have any recollection of that at all .
mr. grady ... ... you were the caretaker here .
i' m sorry to differ with you , sir .
but you ... ... are the caretaker .
you' ve always been the caretaker .
i should know , sir .
i' ve always been here .
did you know , mr. torrance ... ... that your son ... ... is attempting to bring an outside party ... ... into this situation ?
did you know that ?
he is , mr. torrance .
who ?
a nigger .
a nigger ?
a nigger ... ... cook .
how ?
your son ... ... has a very great talent .
i don' t think you are aware how great it is .
but he is attempting to use that very talent ... ... against your will .
well ... ... he is a very willful boy .
indeed he is , mr. torrance .
a very willful boy .
a rather ... ... naughty boy ... ... if i may be so bold , sir .
it' s his mother .
she ... ... interferes .
perhaps they need a good ... ... talking to .
if ... ... you don' t mind my saying so .
perhaps ... ... a bit more .
my girls , sir ... ... they didn' t care for the overlook at first .
one of them actually stole a pack of matches ... ... and tried to burn it down .
but i ... ... corrected them , sir .
and when my wife tried to prevent me from doing my duty ... ... l ... ... corrected her .
we have the snowcat .
if the weather breaks ... ... we might just be able ... ... to get down the mountain .
i could call the forest rangers first ... ... and ... ... tell them that we' re coming ... .... so that ... ... they could start searching for us in case we didn' t make it .
and if jack won' t come with us ... ... l' il just have to tell him that we' re going by ourselves .
that' s all there is to it .
redrum .
redrum .
what' s the matter , hon ?
redrum !
are you having a bad dream ?
hon ?
danny' s not here , mrs. torrance .

the snowplows are keeping things moving in town ... ... but the mountain roads are blocked .

can you fix me up with one ?
what' s the big deal about getting there today ... ... especially in this weather ?
larry , just between you and me , we got a very serious problem ... ... with the people taking care of the place .
they turned out to be completely unreliable assholes .
ullman phoned me last night .
and i' m supposed to find out if they have to be replaced .
how long will it take you to get here ?
about five hours .
i' m going to rent a car here at the airport .

i really appreciate that .
that' s all right .

you' re with hal and charlie on radio 63 , khow , denver .
and we have a bad day out there .
heavy snow throughout the denver metro area .
many mountain passes ... ...
wolf creek and red mountain passes are closed ... ... and the chain law is in effect at the eisenhower tunnel .
we hear from the news department ... ... only a few flights are landing at stapleton airport ... ... and with storms like this ... ... l guess the entire airport will be closed within the hour .
the storm will continue through the day and the weather service ... ... has declared a stockman' s and traveler' s advisory ... ... for all areas outlying the denver metro region .
get the cows in the barn .
hon ?
listen to me for a minute , will you ?
i' m just going to go and talk to daddy for a few minutes ... ... and i' il be right back .
i want you to just stay here ... ... and watch your cartoons , okay ?

i think ... ... we should discuss what should be done with him .
what should be done with him ?
i don' t know .
i don' t think that' s true .
i think you have some very definite ideas ... ... about what should be done with danny .
and i' d like to know what they are .

you think " maybe " he should be taken to a doctor ?
when do you think " maybe " he should be taken to a doctor ?
as soon as possible ?
as soon as possible ?
please .
you believe his health might be at stake .
yes .
and you are concerned about him .
and are you concerned about me ?
of course i am .
of course you are !
have you ever thought about my responsibilities ?
what are you talking about ?
have you ever had a single moment' s ... ... thought about my responsibilities ?
have you ever thought for a single moment ... ... about my responsibilities to my employers ? !
has is ever occurred to you ... ... that i have agreed to look after the hotel until may 1 st ?
does it matter to you at all ... ... that the owners have placed their complete confidence in me ... ... and that i have signed a letter of agreement ... ... in which i' ve accepted that responsibility ?
do you have the slightest idea ... ... what a moral and ethical principal is ?
do you ? !
has it ever occurred to you what would happen to my future ... ... if i fail to live up to my responsibilities ?
has it ever occurred to you ?
has it ? !
stay away from me !
why ?
i just want to go back to my room .
why ?

hello , grady .
mr. torrance ... ... l see you can hardly have taken care of the ... ... business we discussed .
no need to rub it in , mr. grady .
i' il deal with that situation as soon as i get out of here .
will you indeed , mr. torrance ?
i wonder .
i have my doubts .
i , and others , have come to believe ... ... that your heart is not in this .
that you haven' t the belly for it .
just give me one more chance to prove it , mr. grady .
that' s all i ask .
your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined , mr. torrance .
somewhat more ... ... resourceful .
she seems to have got the better of you .
for the moment , mr. grady .
only for the moment .
i fear you will have to deal with this matter ... ... in the harshest possible way , mr. torrance .
i fear ... ... that is the only thing to do .
there' s nothing i look forward to ... ... with greater pleasure , mr. grady .
you give your word on that , do you , mr. torrance ?
i give you my word .
redrum .
redrum .
danny , stop it !
i' m home .
come out , come out , wherever you are .
i can' t get out .
