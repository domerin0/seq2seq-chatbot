daddy , wait !

adolf hitler ...
adolf hitler ... builds the german military machine ... and drags all of europe into war .
but even while france falls to hitler ...
america still refuses to join the fighting .
where' s mccawley and walker ?
still training , sir .
allright , danny .
now let' s show ' em how to fly .
we' re gonna play chicken .

this ain' t the farm , and these ain' t no cropdusters .
i' m not playing chicken with you .

i' il tell you what
i' m not doing it , rafe .

righty tighty !
aah !
whoo hoo !
whoo hoo hoo !
those are some smooth aces .
did you say something ?
' cause let me tell ya , those farm boys are grounded !
yes , sir , an entirely unacceptable use ... of m m military aircraft , sir .
get my hat .
yes , sir .
get those hedge hoppers in doolittle' s office .
after two years of training ... you believe that a $45, 000 airplane ... is there for your amusement ?
no , sir .
i was just trying ... to keep my edge , major .
and when you did the outside loop last week ... what did you think that was ?
honing your skills ?
that' s not training , mccawley .
that' s a stunt .
and i personally consider it to be reckless ... and irresponsible .
major ...
how could that be , when you' re famous ... for being the first man in the world ever to do it ?
don' t get cute with me , son .
no , sir , i don' t mean to be disrespectful .
i just think that well , i
it is reckless and irresponsible ... if you' re just doing it to be a show off .
but i was doing it to try to inspire the men , sir ... in the way that you' ve inspired me .
i believe the french even have a word for that ... when the men get together to honor their leaders .
they call it an homage , sir .
a what ?
an homage , sir .
that' s bullshit , mccawley !
but it' s very , very good bullshit .
thank you , sir .
mccawley , you remind me of myself fifteen years ago .
which is why we need to discuss this .
have a seat , son .
the british have accepted you into the eagle squadron .
you' re on your way to england tomorrow ... if you still want to go .
huh .
wow .
just a few british pilots are all that stand ... between hitler and total victory in europe .
they' re gonna need all the help they can get .
yes , sir .
well , i' m on my way .
just for the record ...
i' m supposed to ask you to reconsider .
sir ?
sooner or later we' re gonna be in this war ... whether we like it or not .
and i' m gonna need all of my best pilots .
so it' s my duty to ask you to stay .
major , what would you do ?
if it was me ...
i' d go .
get out .
am i going bald right back here ?
ooh !
man , i am one good lookin ' son of a bitch .
don' t you ever die .
die .
that' s exactly ... the concept you gotta work tonight .
you put a drop of this clove oil under your eyes ... and you let ' em sting and well up .
you get your nurse alone , take a breath ...
let her see your eyes glisten ... and say , " baby , they' re training me for war ...
and i don' t know what' il happen ...
but if i die tomorrow , i want to know ...
that we lived all we could tonight .
come on , guys !
we got nurses waitin ' .
come on , before the rest of his hair falls out .
how could you do this ?
well , doolittle assigned me .
he wanted me to get some real real combat training in .
well , guess what ?
it' s not training over there .
it' s war .
where the losers die , and there aren' t any winners just guys who turn into broken down wrecks ...
like my father .
yeah , i understand that , danny .
but i feel like i got a duty to go .
don' t preach to me about duty , damn it .
i wear the same uniform you do .
now , if trouble wants me , i' m ready for it .
but why go looking for it ?
god , danny , come on .
i' m gonna be twenty five .
i might as well be an old man .
they' re gonna have me bein ' a flight instructor .
i don' t wanna teach loops and barrel rolls .
i wanna be a combat fighter .
hey , come on !
the nurses can' t d d dance by themselves .
let' s go .
if the call of duty means seeing 150 men ... in their underwear every day ... we are here to serve .
i can' t believe it .
saturday night in new york city .
do you know what they' re doing where i come from ?
nothing .
cow tipping .
well , that' s why you joined the navy , hon ' .
to get out of that dusty little town and see the world .
may i remind you , barbara , we' re navy nurses , not tourists .
i joined to do my patriotic duty and ... to meet guys .
me , too .
girls , we' re gonna have so much fun tonight in the city .
you' ve gotta tell them the story , evelyn .
what ?
oh , come on .
tell us .
oh , it' s such a long story .
we got time .
i saw it happen .
well , it was about four weeks ago ...

x e , ma' am .
ma' am , i know how this looks .
i' m sorry , lieutenant , i really am .
but army and navy requires 20/ 20 vision .
oh , i it' s it' s not a problem with my eyes .
i mean , i can see .
i mean , i can hit a running rabbit with a $3 . 00 pistol .
i got a problem with letters , that' s all .
well , maybe after some schooling ... you could come back and take the test again .
no , i had schooling .
i mean , i the teachers just never knew ... what to make of it .
it' s just letters .
i mix ' em up sometimes .
that' s all .
i mean , i just get ' em backward sometimes .
l look here .
uh , my my math and and spacial reasoning ... and my verbal scores are all excellent .
but you barely passed the written exam .
yeah , but he did pass it .
so , is it my turn now ?
no , you' il wait your turn .
yes , ma' am .
ma' am , i i' m never gonna be an english teacher .
but i know why i' m here .
to be a pilot .
and you don' t dogfight with manuals .
you don' t fly with gauges .
i mean , it' s all about feeling and speed ... and lettin ' that plane become like a part ... of your body .
and that manual ... says that a guy who' s a slow reader can' t be a good pilot .
that file says i' m the best pilot in this room .
ma' am , please , don' t take my wings .
well , i felt so bad .
evelyn , rotate to station three .
i had no choice .
i passed him .
good .
uh huh .
so , then this cocky pilot comes back .

yes , sir .
sorry , sir .

yes , sir .
parade rest .
yes , sir .
ma' am , i didn' t get a chance to thank you .
drop your skivvies .
ah , oh , ok .
just like this ?
that' s fine .
he did have a very cute butt .
you know , i know you didn' t have to pass me ... and you did .
and i just
i didn' t think you' d understand , and you did .
you know , you still haven' t said thank you .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
why' d you do it ?
i mean , i' m just curious .
you' re like my hero now .
actually , my father was a pilot .
and , um , i' ve seen first hand what happens ... when a pilot loses his wings .
you know what ?
your father' s my hero , then , too .
infact , as an officer , i think it' d by my duty ... to take my new hero' s daughter out tonight ...
just to aah !
gosh , did i poke too deep ?
i think you hit the bone there .
you are so mean .
what ?
so is is there any chance ... that you might , kind of , sort of ... you know , like me , or ...
oh , how did you guess ?
they never taught us ... how to deal with this ... feeling .
wh what feeling ?
well , it' s kind of like ... this .
ow !
well , he was getting fresh , so i poked him again .
all right , romeo .
i want to get this over with .
hold on a second .
miss ...
i really , really lick you .
what did he mean ?
like you .
i didn' t mean to say that .
and i just , um ...
i just want to ask you , please , if i can donate dinner .
he started to act very strange .
or , well , buy you dinner .
this isn' t your chart .
whoa .

what' d you do to him ?
poor guy .
hey !
hey !
oh , my god .
are you ok ?
uh , yeah .
i' m fine .

i thought , you know , maybe we could celebrate .
celebrate what ?
oh , i don' t know .
uh , well , you being my hero , for one .
ok .
why not ?
so , uh , ahem ...
i wanted to thank you .
and i just wanted to , uh ... put your mind at ease about passing me ... because i really do think you did this country a service .
i mean , i' m i am a great flier .
and if you have a fault , which you obviously don' t ... it' s modesty .
no .
if i have a fault , it' s candor .
you are just so
uhh .
cork just got away from me .
god , oh , it hurts .
it hurts something fierce .
i' m sorry .

i can' t breathe .
lay still .
you are so beautiful it hurts .
it' s your nose that hurts .

i think it' s my heart .
and then i kissed him .
oh , evelyn .
that' s the most romantic story i ever heard .
it' s been the most romantic four weeks and two days of my life .
oh , i' m so jealous .
hello , lieutenant .
it' s good to see you .
you , too , lieutenant .
pick a hand .
it' s beautiful .
what' s in your other hand ?
mine .
well , it took me six hours to fold these .
oh !
i want you to meet my friends .
rafe , this is martha , barbara , sandra
hi .
i' m betty .
hi .
would you happen to have any friends ?
huh .
take your pick .
hi .
whoo !
we ever get in this war and somethin ' happens to me ...
i can' t tell you how good it makes me feel to know ... that someone as sweet as you will be there ... to nurse me back to health .
good , but we' re not in the war yet .
ahem .
ok .
that was a bad line .
hi .
i' m i' m red .
red [ snorting ]
s s s s strange .
heh heh .
your last name' s strange ?
yeah .
she' s all yours , soldier .
no .
it it' s winkle .
red is such a ladies ' man .
do you always stutter ?
no .
only when i' m [ snorting ]
she' s totally buying it .
nervous ?
yeah .
why can' t i get something like that ?
hello .
hi .
danny seems kind of shy around the girls .
tsk .
it' s not that he' s shy .
he' s just , ahem ... a little unsure of himself , you know .
his old man used to run him down a lot .
get him in a plane , he' s sure of himself .
he' s like my brother .
he' s like my best friend .
he' s my right hand .
which at the moment is a long way south of my waist .
oh , i' m sorry .
i guess i lost a little altitude .
yeah , i guess you did .
excuse me .
you and me , we got to talk .
so , the rumor is the navy' s shipping us to pearl harbor .
well , won' t be so bad .
it' s about as far from the fighting as you can get .
you' il get a sun tan .
so maybe the army' il post you guys there , too .
you ... are a super special woman .
and , and , well ...
well , they' re they' re training me ... to be a big bad warrior , and , well ...
so , i mean , you never know what might happen tomorrow ... or ... or any day after that , you know ?
so ...
god , we need to make tonight super special .
why are you crying ?
i guess it' s the thought ... that i might not ever get to see you again .
dry your eyes , toots .
tonight , you' re mine .
i don' t want to be with a crowd tonight .
i just want to be alone with you .
well ...
how does new york harbor by moonlight sound ?
ohh !
heh heh !
are you gonna be a bad influence ?
of course i' m a bad influence .
let' s see if we can commandeer this vessel ...
' cause we' re , uh , officers of the u. s. government .
not for long , we won' t be .
one day , we' il take a trip on a boat like that .
would you like that ?
we' il be dressing for cocktails and walk into the grandsalon .
no one' s talking about war .
they' re just dancing to cole porter .
i' il have to get a tux .
yeah .
come on .
there you go .
all aboard .
you' re out of your mind .
oh , yeah .
careful now .
here , sit down .
now let' s see here .
ah !
there we go .

so , at least i tried , right ?
actually , you know what ?
this is better .
yeah , it is .
god , you' re pretty .
what' s gonna become of us all , rafe ?
well , the future' s not exactly in our hands , is it ?
no .
i guess you' re right .
aah !
aah !
oh , my god !

that was not part of the date .
watch your step .
oh , thank you .
evelyn !
guys , come up !
come on up !
come up !
we' re in 321 .
there' s something i got to tell you .
well , you got no secrets from me , lieutenant .
i' ve seen your medical chart .
here we go .
this can' t be good , or it wouldn' t be so hard to say .
yep .
i got to go away .
we' re all going away .
yeah ... but i' m going to the war ... tomorrow .
i' m flying with the eagle squadron .
it' s an outfit the british started for american pilots .
i don' t understand .
you' re in the u. s. army .
how could they order you to go ?
they didn' t order me .
i volunteered .
huh .
but i passed you .
i let you through .
and now you volunteer ... for the most dangerous place you could go ?
it' s not your responsibility , not your choice .
flying' s the only thing i ever wanted to do .
i mean , everything in my life has led me up to this point .
meeting you .
i love you .
i love you so much .
let' s go inside .
all right .
wait a minute .
wait a minute .
just i i can' t do this .
this just it' s not right .
i' m sorry .
i just
see , i can' t do this .
i mean , i mean , i can .
i i want to .
i' m not trying to be noble , you know .
or not saying i know what would happen ... or just i need to stop talking .
i just i just don' t want
i just don' t want it to be like everybody else .
i don' t want you to have anything about tonight ... that you regret .
i mean , it' s been the most incredible night of my life ... and i don' t want to ruin that .
oh , you couldn' t ruin it .
if i had one more night to live , i' d want to spend it with you .
see , that' s what i want to come home to .
that' s what i want to have to think about and dream about .
i want to know that the best part of my life ... is still ahead of me .
look .
don' t , um ... could you ... not come see me off ?
because , uh ... saying good bye to you once is hard enough .
here .
take this .
why ?
you think it looks good on me ?
i will come back .
i thought you said you told her not to come .
yeah , i did .
why you looking for her then ?
it' s my test .
if i tell her not to come , and she comes anyway ... then i i know she loves me .
all aboard !
track 57 !
if , uh , anything happens to me ...
i want you to be the one to tell her .
all right ?
you just make sure and come back for the both of us , all right ?
ok .
see you when i get back .
yeah .
good hunting , rafe .
evelyn !
evelyn !
evelyn !
evelyn !
evelyn .
hey !
she loves me .
the german luftwaffe ... relentlessly bombards downtown london ... while churchill' s royal air force ... is in a deadly struggle ... to maintain control of the british skies .
this is a real mess .
lieutenant mccawley reporting for duty , sir .
good .
we' il get you settled into your quarters .
and then introduce you to the crate you' il be flying .
if y' all are patching up bullet holes here ... maybe we ought to skip housekeeping ... and get me in an airplane .
two didn' t come back , sir .
we counted only eleven .
are all yanks as anxious as you ... to get themselves killed , pilot officer ?
not anxious to die , sir .
just anxious to matter .
this is yours .
good chap .
didn' t die till he' d landed and shut down his engine .
please be seated , gentlemen .
i' m afraid i' m in a bad mood .
churchill and stalin are asking me what i' m asking you .
how long is america going to pretend ... the world is not at war ?
we' ve increased food and oil shipments , mr. president ... and as far as i know
what they really need are tanks , planes ... bullets , bombs , and men to fight .
but our people think hitler and his nazit hugs ... are europe' s problem .
we have to do more .
send the brits and russians more of our ships ... and anti aircraft weapons .
and keep cannibalizing the pacific fleet ?
what choice do we have ?
we' re building refrigerators while our enemies build bombs .
this is so exciting .
you know there' s about one hundred ships on pearl .
how many sailors per ship ?
it depends .
more on a battleship than a sub .
but say , on average ... 2, 000 ?
then there' s the flyers , the marines , base personnel .
i' m still working on the sailors .
girls , i think the odds are in your favor .
yeah , like 4, 000 to one .
it' s paradise .
see you on the beach , boys !
we' re in hawaii !
hey !
you' re not supposed to paint titties ... on the side of my airplanes .
and if you do , don' t make ' em lopsided .
they were lopsided , earl .
look , it says right here .
never ride waves amongst rocks or submerged pilings .
see , it says you shouldn' t do that .
how do you know they' re submerged if they' re submerged ?
gooz , what in the hell are you doing ?
just trying to fix this surfboard thing .
he keeps taking chunks off his nose on the rocks .
on my day off , i' m working on my new invention the gooz cruise fin .
i' m gonna be a rich fella .
every surfboard in the nation' s gonna need one .
yeah ?
well , you' re gonna need a broom .
check out these new recruits .
hi .
aloha .
y' all pilots ?
we' re working on it .
it' s a lot of switches and stuff .
pride of the pacific .
who are you ?
terrors of the skies .
welcome , ladies .
hi .
i have to deal with toasty sun burnt fanny ... before i can show you around .
ow !
dear evelyn .
it' s different than i thought it would be here .
it' s cold so cold it goes deep into your bones .
there is one place i can go to find warmth .
that is to think of you .
i just wish i could be back there with you .
it' s not easy making friends .
two days ago , i had a beer ... with a couple of the raf pilots .
yesterday , both of them got killed .
dear rafe .
i miss you so much .
it' s so strange to be half a world away from you .
i' m right on his tail !
got one !
every night i look at the sunset ... and try to draw the last ounce of heat from its long day ... and send it from my heart to yours .
family ?
girl , sir .
the girl .
a lot of people frown on the yanks ... for not being in this war yet .
i' d just like to say ... if there are many more back home like you ...
god help anyone who goes to war with america .
atten hut !
attention on deck !
admiral kimmel ...
commander in chief , pacific fleet , on deck .
sharp presentation , captain .
thank you , admiral kimmel .
for four months now washington' s been blowing pink smoke ... about the threat from japan .
could make us lose our fighting edge .
i' m determined not to let that happen .
with your permission , captain .
admiral , urgent , from washington .
i' m supposed to keep this fleet ... battle ready to take on the japanese ... cover half the damn globe .
now they want me to transfer ... another twelve destroyers to the atlantic .
don' t they know what we' re facing out here ?
they feel europe is the greater danger .
i' m assuming these risk assessments include hawaii ?
pearl harbor is too shallow for an aerial torpedo attack .
we' re surrounded by sub nets .
all we need worry about is sabotage ... so we bunched our planes together ... to make them easier to protect .
distance is our ally , admiral .
you analysts got it all figured out , don' t you ?
the smart enemy hits you ... exactly where you think you' re safe .
incoming !
i fixed the hydraulics and electrics , sir ... but the oil hoses still need attention .
just crank it , lan !
god speed you , sir .

this is the hard earned greenbacks ... of every pot scrubbin ' chop in this fleet .
now if we don' twin ...
teeny here has to find another battleship !
i' m not going back to the arizona empty handed .
don' t worry about the money .
i' il send that smug engine fixin ' snipe ... back below decks where he belong .
we the man !
he slapped your mama !
be a son of a bitch !
look at this !
all right , dorie !
that' s enough .
that' s enough .
oh !
where' s my money ?
nah , fight' s rigged .
we' re rich !
ha ha ha !
how' d you get this ?
boxing .
did you win ?
yes , ma' am .
what do you get for winning ?
respect .
so , why do you have to fight with your fists to get respect ?
i left my momma in texas ... and joined the navy to see the world ... become a man .
they made me a cook .
not even that .
i clean up after other sailors eat .
two years , they never even let me fire a weapon .
well , let' s hope you never have to .
yes , ma' am .
you take care , petty officer miller .
you , too , ma' am .
you know , he taught me to fly .
i always knew that no matter what trouble i got into ...
i' d never be in it alone .
he' d be there with me .
he was always pushing me to be better and faster .
he told me you were a great flier .
it was the same night he told me ... he' d volunteered to go to england .
volunteered ?
he ... he told me he' d been assigned .
he was always trying to protect me .
but you know what ?
i look at myself in the mirror in this uniform ... and i still don' t know who i am .
i look like a hero ... but i don' t feel like it .
rafe ... he always looked the part , didn' t he ?
he couldn' t wait to be one .
to rafe mccawley .
the best pilot ... and the best friend i ever knew ... or ever will know .
to rafe .
look at this .
the japanese ... are flooding the pacific with radio traffic .
everywhere from the panama canal to southeast asia .
there' s no logical pattern , captain .
no .
there' s always logic .
they know we read their mail .
they' re trying to make us think their fleet is moving south .
i' m not buying it .
something , something' s up .
otherwise , why would they take the trouble to bullshit me ?
evelyn , i signed for these letters for you today .
they' re from england .
they' re from rafe .
i' m sorry , ev .
you know how long it takes mail to get here .
hurry up !
show time , boys !
come on !
america still awaits japan' s response ... to peace proposals .
ambassador nomura arrives in washington ... in what could hopefully guarantee ... continued peace in the pacific .
on the british front , churchill declares ...
give us the tools , and we will finish thejob .
the raf has fought bravely against ...
hitler' s ambition to rule the skies over the channel .
victory does not come without sacrifice .
evelyn !
danny .
hey .
some comedy , huh ?
yeah .
it' s been a while .
i' ve been logging a lot of flight hours .
i kinda been avoiding you , too .
yeah .
look  do you
do you want to ?
sure , yeah .
i remember one time when i was ...
like , seven years old ...
i was always building gadgets and things .
he wanted me to build him some wings ... so he could fly like his daddy .
i told him you can' t fly without some kind of engine .
but he wouldn' t listen .
danny , never mind that , just build ' em anyway .
so i did .
and i' m up there ... strapping these big ol ' wings on his back ... that we made from paper and glue ... and these massive silk bloomers that we stole .
he looked so stupid , and i told him ...
you can' t jump off the barn in these .
and bam !
he busted his leg on a backhoe .
god , i miss him .
yeah .
but don' t you think ... that rafe wasn' t back upthere next day .
cast and everything ... telling me to make some adjustments on those wings .
check this out !

it' s been months .
it' s time to move on .
i am moving on .
ev , don' t lie .
all i know is , i hear you crying when you think i' m asleep .
when my dad left ...
i was too much for my mom to handle ... so she sent me to live with my aunt .
i thought my life was over ...
but you don' t know where it' s all gonna lead .
if i hadn' t run away and lied about my age ... and enlisted in the navy ...
i wouldn' t have met red , and ... now he' s my fiance .
oh , god , i can' t get used to that word .
it' s only been twelve hours .
oh , betty !
little betty beat us all to the post .

you gotta go on living , ev .
red !
whoo !
sorry !
bye , rafe .
the japanese fleet is missing .
they' re operating under radio silence .
this footage was shot four days ago on october 28th .
we' re sending scout planes in wider vectors ... all over the pacific , but they get nothing .
they could be anywhere in here .
i don' t understand how two whole carrier divisions ... can just disappear .
clear !
aw , we' re all over the page .
we got one wall eyed and one pigeon toed .
anthony , tap in number six .
all right .
gooz , tap in number three .
all right .
hey .

oh ... that ain' t no navy issue uniform , eh ?
danny , it' s evelyn .
jesus !

yeah .
yeah .
no .
i think i' m fallin ' for her .
wow .
you know , i saw this coming .
i didn' t want this to happen .
it just kind of did .
can' t help it .
well , danny , she' s gotta be with somebody .
it might as well be you .
you telling me if you were dead ... and you saw your best buddy doin ' your girl ... you wouldn' t come back and beat the living crap outta him ?
tony , back off .
i' d be back so fast .
danny' s being a better friend taking care of her himself .
i got a girlfriend .
that' s great .
come on , fellas .
let' s split .
danny , whatever happens now is just about you and her .
you gotta try and forget about rafe .
be careful , allright ?
ladies ... cloud the mind .
thanks , gooz .
you' re welcome .
hey , danny .
where' s everybody going ?

does it seem like everybody' s acting a little strange ?
no .
nah .
right .
well , maybe maybe a little .
yeah .
well , people in this outfit ... have way too much time on their hands .
oh , yeah .
i just hope they don' t think there' s been something ... goin ' on between us , that' s all .
oh , no .
i mean , no .

yeah , all right .
i' il see you around .
shit .
evelyn .
have you ever seen pearl harbor at sunset ?
of course .
well ... from the air ?
you know , i could get kicked out of the military for this .
really ?
yeah .
stay down .
the hawaiians called this harbor wai momi .
it means " water of pearls .
it' s so beautiful .
my dad took me up a couple of times .
just don' t do what he did .
what do you call it when you flip over ?
a barrelroll ?
yeah .
i won' t .
aah !
oh !
ha ha ha ha !
oh , god .
what do you think ?
i like that .
hey !
that plane was supposed to be back here an hour ago !
quick , hide in the parachute hangar .
my heart is pounding .
danny , last night ...
no , that' s terrible .
danny , we need to talk about this .
sir .
evelyn !
danny .
hey .
hi .
hi .
i didn' t sleep a wink last night .
i had to see you .
last night was crazy , i know , but ...
i' m not sorry .
are you ?
i don' t know .
danny , i had a wonderful time last night .
i
it' s just all too fast .
listen , evelyn , i was just down at the beach this morning ... and i watched the sun rise ... and i knew that everything was gonna be different .
that this was the start of something new .
in this place , in this moment .
and i don' t care what anybody else says , you know ?
how can i not feel this way ?
i kinda like you .
oh , you do ?
you have your tie on crooked .
everything' s gonna be all right , ok ?
everything' s gonna be all right .
do you have any airtours going through the valley of oahu ?
you do ?
male radlohost : aloha .
this is kgmb in honolulu ... on another beautiful fall day here in paradise .
we have enough information .
we are returning home .
do you ever wonder ... if this war' s gonna catch up with us ?
nota whole lot .
every moment we' re not together , you' re upthere training for it .
yeah , well , i' m training for moments like these ...
' cause i have no idea ... how i' m gonna get this car out of the sand .
evelyn , can you please come out of the bathroom ?
you' ve been there for an hour .
evelyn !
what are you trying to do , look like me ?
are you ok ?
yeah .
what' s the matter ?
no , you
d' oy .
they call it the vacant sea .
none of the major sea lanes go through it ... and you can bury the entire land mass of asia there ... and nobody would know .
from there , they could attack anywhere .
our last signals intercept ... indicate that the japanese taskforce is heading south ... towards the philippines or southeast asia .
but captain thurman of naval intelligence here ... has his own theory about the missing ships .
sir , i believe they' il try to hit us ... where it' il hurt us the most pearl harbor .
it' s over 4, 000 nautical miles from japan to pearl .
that' s a long distance to steam a navy , captain .
your theory is based on what ?
well , it' s what i would do .
that' s not exactly hard evidence , captain thurman .
well , admiral , if i had hard evidence ... we' d already be at war .
sir , we can read their diplomatic codes ... faster than they can type them .
but captain thurman' s cryptology team ... is still trying to crack the naval codes .
the intercepts have missing words and garbled lines ... so to explain the decrypts , we have to try to interpret ... what we think they' re trying to do .
interpret ?
you mean guess .
they use their informed intuition , sir .
we guess .
it' s like playing chess in the dark .
any rumor , troop movement , ship movement ... spine tingle , goose bump , we pay attention to it .
when i was in the asiatic fleet ... the locals used to try to get outside of a problem ... to try to see the inside .
well , i see a strike on pearl .
it' s the worst thing that could happen .
a blow to pearl would devastate ... the pacific fleet' s ability to make war .
so , sir , you would have us mobilize the entire fleet ... at the cost of millions of dollars ... based on this spine tingling feeling of yours ?
no , sir .
my job is to gather and interpret material .
making difficult decisions ... based on incomplete information ... from my limited decoding ability ... is your job , sir .
then break the damn naval code , captain ... so i can make a better decision .
aye , sir .
we are trying .
i wonder if we shouldn' t put the pacific fleet on full alert .
in case the optimism ... of the " honolulu advertiser " proves unfounded , gentlemen ... what are general short and the army ... going to do about protecting my ships ?
within a ten mile radius of your harbor ... we have fighterplanes here at wheeler ... bombers at hickam , and a trainingstrip at haleiwa .
we' ve recently established a radar station here ... that can detect planes 125 miles out .
which is a month old , admiral , and untested .
i' ve seen these new radar screens , major .
there' s no way of telling whether they' re ours , theirs ... or a flock of damn birds .
i' m intercepting a call from tokyo ... to somewhere close by pearl .
there' s a call from tokyo .
they say they don' t know you .
hello ?
hai .
it' s a local dentist .
he can see pearl harbor from his office .
are there many sailors around ?
uh , the dentist says that the flatships ... are not in port .
they' re talking about the weather .
he doesn' t seem to know who he' s talking to .
hello ?
hello ?
moshi moshi .
hello ?
that was a strange call .
admiral , may i speak to you in private ?
why would a spy use a phone ?
they know we tap all international lines .
our listeners feel it' s probably not code talk .
it sounds like someone in japan is sneaking around ... asking a local citizen the location of our carriers .
well , that makes me feel all warm inside .
get the fbi on it immediately .
have we found the goddamn japanese fleet yet ?
no , admiral .
the bases are looking all over the pacific .
so the entire fleet could be rounding diamond head ... and we wouldn' t know a thing about it .
get on it .
i' m alive .
this is the first i could get word out .
jepense qu' il est mort !
ll estencore en vie .
i told you i' d come back .
here , sit down .
sit down .
come here .
it' s ok .
it' s all right .
you' re real .
yeah .
i wished for this every day .
i know .
me , too .
every second .
so did i.
i thought you were dead .
they said you were shot down in the sea .
yeah , i was .
i was in the ocean .
it was so cold .
i missed you .
i got picked up by a french fishing boat ... and i was in occupied france , and i couldn' t get word out .
and i' m just i' il tell you all about it , i promise .
but i' m fine .
i' m ok .
and i' m here now .
evelyn ...
i just wanted to see you .
you' re so beautiful .
i love you .
hey , it' s ok .
it' s ok .
evelyn , evelyn .
i' m back .
it' s ok .
i won' t leave you again , i promise .
rafe , you died .
and so did i.
i know , but i' m i' m it' s fine now .
i' m back .
we' re together .
i mean , we are together ... right ?
i don' t know where i am .
rafe .
rafe .
stay away .
rafe .
this is radio honolulu ... playing the sweetest music ... on the sweetest island in the pacific .
it' s a beautiful december 6th ... with beautiful music ...
raaaaafe !
oh , goddamnit .
there you go .
a real live ace !
whoo !
an ace is only five .
i shot down six m. e. s .
and i got two smokers , too .
they don' t count them .
of course , i got shot down myself before they could pin me .
so you got back from behind enemy lines , huh ?
what' s that combat like ?
were you scared ?
hey !
one at a time .
well , them luftwaffe boys can fly pretty good .
it' s not like , you know , training .
they' re , uh ...
danny .
you know , they' re all about tactics is what it is .
see , the nazis , right , they' re faster than you are ... so they' il disappear and they get up in the soup ... and they' il throw like a roll or a hammerhead ... and they' il come around on your high side ... shoot you from behind like some americans will .
hey ...
gooz , you' re lookin ' at a real live ace .
well , let me give you the shirt off my back !
whoo !
aloha !
there you go !
i' il take it from you .
i can see how y' all been spending your time out here .
hey , rafe , we gotta talk , all right ?
i got nothin ' to talk about with you .
here .
why don' t you have a drink ?
i' il make a toast .
to returning from the dead .
wasn' t all i expected , but , well , that' s life .
to my best friend and loyal buddy danny ... for keepin ' up the war effort back here at home .
ahh .
you know , where i come from ... somebody makes a toast to you and you don' t drink ... that' s sayin ' something .
all right , rafe .
that' s how it' s gonna be .
to you .
hey , you guys need to spend some time alone , i think .
aw , hell , no , red .
come on .
no , no , no .
we' re celebratin ' here .
me over there fightin ' ... almost gettin ' killed ... my friend danny back here ...
lookin ' after my interests for me .
y' all know danny was even good enough ... to look out for my girl for me while i was gone ?
we thought you were dead , rafe .
and it gutted us both .
and we were just tryin ' to get on with our lives .
life is good , ain' t it , danny ?
you know , you' re a rotten drunk .
you always have been .
well , you' re a lousy friend .
that' s a new development .
you left her to fight somebody else' s war ... and you made damn sure that i didn' t go with you ... and we thought that you were dead
i almost did die , you little son of a bitch !
and her face was the last thing that went through my mind ... so don' t stand there and tell me to act like it' s all right !
yeah , rafe , well , i stayed .
i stayed , and you made sure of that ... and some things changed .
and i hope you can get used to that .
oh , i have to get used to it ?
all right .
we' il see how i can get used to it .
whoa !
hey !
get used to that , boy !
hey , hey !
and that' s my left hand , too !
hey , hey , hey !
hey , come on !
melee at the hula la .
send m. p. s !
aah !
aah !
you called me a lousy friend ?
get your hands off !
aah !
ow !
shit !
come on , danny !
let' s go get ' em .
let' s move out !
oh , no .
they' re gonna throw us in the brig .
let' s get outta here .
oh , shit .
rafe ... you' re the only family i got .
when you were gone ... it was the loneliest i' d ever been .
the same for her , too .
oh , boy , now you' re really breakin ' my heart .
if you hadn' t gone , none of this woulda happened .
oh , so it' s my fault , i guess .
damn it , rafe .
i just know there' s got to be some way ... we can work things out so that ... things could be right between me and you .
i just don' t see how it could ever be the same .
revered father ...
i go now to fulfill my mission and my destiny .
i hope it is a destiny ... that will bring honor to our family ... and if it requires my life ...
i will sacrifice it gladly ... to be a good servant of our nation .
hey ... we got a large haze .
that' s too big to be planes , right ?
is that what you wanna do ?
knight to knight five ?
boom !
wrong move .
lieutenant , radar' s picking up ... a large return moving in from the northeast .
hang on .
relax .
it' s a flight of b 17s coming in from the mainland .
nothing to worry about .
a heck of a lot of b 17s .
good shot , hop .
this better be good , commander .
one of our destroyers reports having fired and sunk ... enemy submarine attempting to enter pearl harbor at 0653 .

recall the staff .
failure ...

and dispose of immediately .
special emphasis on destroying important parts .

acknowledge .
admiral ...
naval intel intercepted a transmission from tokyo ... to the japanese embassy in washington ... instructing them to break apart all decoder machines ... and burn all secret documents .
the japanese are expecting a war .

warning of possible ...
japanese aggressive movement in any direction .
broken relationship .
hostilities imminent .
but where ?
