how much ?
price is not important .
no , price is very important , actually .
okay .
you got me .
take me away .
okay .
it' s a little bit expensive , but let me tell you , it' s worth it .

i' m so happy for you .
really ?
yeah , of course , really .
well ... here' s the thing , jake .
i' ve been thinking about it , and , um ...
i' m excited , but i' m not as excited as i am about you and me ... and so i don' t think i wanna go , because i wanna be near you .
so i thought i' d put in for a transfer and stay here .
what do you think ?
wow !
um , that' s ... unexpected .
um  it is ?
yeah .
are you sure that that is the best thing ?
oh , i  for for you ?
oh .
i don' t know .
i
i thought you' d be excited .
no .

i i' m sorry .
i thought am i off base here ?
sorry .

it was just an impulse .
it' s totally fine .

i
i think that tequila shot made me a little giddy .
should we go somewhere and talk about this ?
no , no , no , no .
let' s get outta here .
no , no , no .
no , no .
let' s go talk about it .
no , no , no .
no , no , no .
it' s totally great .
it' s so fine .
i' m having a great time .
let' s just have fun , okay ?
ooh .
no , i don' t oh .
whoo !
let' s go dance .
playin ' in a rock and roll band
i never had no problems , yeah
burnin ' down the one nightstands
and everything around me , yeah
amen .
amen .
oh , my !
sicko .
sicko .
i can' t laugh .
my spleen hurts .
i' m so full .
h how did you stay such a skinny kid in this household with you cooking like this ?
he was always blessed .
he got my genes .
ethan , on the other hand , that' s another story .
when he was a kid , he was such a little chub .
he actually had to miss school one day because he couldn' t fit into any of his pants .
you' re joking .
no , it' s the truth .
he had to call in fat .
mom , he never called in fat .
come on .
give the guy a break .
he looks so good these days .
you should see him .
he' s been working out with a trainer .
jackie' s got him on this this regimen .
i mean , he looks very trim and slim .
he looks good .
he' s looking very trim because she don' t know how to cook .
she' s a good cook .
you might find that out if you ever tried some of her food .
i don' t wanna talk about this any more .
get it ?
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
what were we talking about ?
the meal was so good .
this was so good .
thank you .
hear !
hear !
as always .
all right .
yep .
somebody' s gotta feed all these skinny people in the world .
okay , now you guys get the dishes , and the ladies will talk .
jake , put on some water for tea , will you ?
it' s like a fairy tale , these flowers framing you .
that' s called a chuppah .
wow .
oh , my god .
you look so beautiful together .
please .
we were so young .
we were kids .
as much grief as i give jake , i think you' re all doing it the right way .
it takes at least ten years to get to know yourself well enough to stop being a total idiot .
it' s hard enough without binding yourself to another total idiot .
well , what' s scary is , when you spend those ten years ... going after the things you thought were important ... get those things , and then feel a sneaking suspicion that you went after the wrong things ... and that where the important things are concerned ... you' re still a total idiot .
can i ask you a question ?
mm hmm .
is my son a good kisser ?
you' re in a very good mood .
i' m usually in a good mood .
but you' re in a particularly good mood right now .
okay , yes .
yes , i am .
i' m in a a very good mood .
okay .
do you wanna share anything ?
not quite yet .
maybe soon , though .
really ?
yeah .
soon ?
mm hmm .
okay .
well , you let me know , okay ?
i will .
i will .
i' il be looking out for that .
no , that' s what she said that' s what  ridiculous .
i' m so sorry .
jesus , what happened ?
nothing .
girl talk .
we' re fine .
i didn' t go into explicit detail , but she knows we weren' t holding hands .
god !
i can' t believe you did that .
we agreed this was between us .
jake , i didn' t tell her .
she figured it out on her own .
well , did you at least try to deny it ?
come on , jake .
she knew !
oh .
no wonder she was crying .
you know , i was crying too , all right ?
we had a very nice talk about it , to be honest with you .
yes , she was upset , but she was not angry .
yeah , no , that' s the face she put on for you .
i don' t think so .
i know , okay ?
all right ?
i mean , trust me .
you have no idea the nightmare that i' m in for now .
all right , you know what ?
this is not a nightmare , okay ?
so stop it .
hey , look at me .
look at me .
i am in love with you , jake .
yeah , i love you too .
no , you are in love with me , you jerk .
you just won' t say it because you' re scared of what it involves .
yes , i am .
yeah , me too .
but i' m dealing with it because i am overwhelmed by this feeling that i have for you ... and i want to see if i can work it out .
great .
how do i work it out ?
okay .
let' s just take it from the top .
don' t talk to me about your mother or your brother or your synagogue .
just you .
what do you need to work it out ?
those things are me .
do you understand that ?
i can' t separate them out .
i mean , it might be hard for you to accept , but the fact that you' re not jewish is a real problem for me .
i don' t think so .
okay , okay , okay .
a all i' m saying , jake ... is i think you should be honest with yourself .
because i think if it was just up to you ... you would stick with this and see where this relationship is going ... but it' s a problem for you because you assume that all the people in your life can' t deal with that .
no , they can' t .
well , give them a little credit , jake .
it' s the 21st century .
" the 21st century " ?
what the hell does the 21st century have to do with anything ?
this is you and me , right ?
i thought we were supposed to be just having a good time , keep it simple .
well , that' s my point .
i' m having fun .
i' m having fun too .
this is a lot of fun .
whoo !
fun !
well , exactly .
so why throw it away ?
look , maybe you' re right , but can' t you see that you' re asking me ... to risk losing everything that' s important to me ... just to see if we work ?
i mean , i love you , but but but we' re so different in so many ways that have nothing to do with whether or not you' re jewish .
what are you saying ?
i' m saying we have totally different priorities .
look at your life .
i don' t think there' s room in it for what i' ve spiritually committed to .
that is so unfair .
your faith is a huge part of what i love about you ... but you have to have some patience for the fact ... that it doesn' t come as easily for most people as it does for you .
and you know what ?
you are never going to find the kind of relationship that i know you want ... and you are never going to be the kind of spiritual leader that you could be ... until you learn to put a little faith in other people .
i' m not saying , " let' s get married .
all i' m saying is that i am in love with you , and i want to give it a real shot .
that' s all i' m saying .
i don' t know what to say .
how about " i' ve been waiting for someone like you my whole life , and i' m not gonna let you go " ?
i' m sorry .
you think you' re sorry now .
wait till you realize i just went out that door and i' m not coming back .
this is my apartment .
you get out .
this is for you .
who' s calling at this hour ?
this is barbaric .
i don' t know .
i' m sorry .
i was dreaming about my mother' s sausages .
hello ?
brian ?
hey , what' s wrong ?
i need to talk to you .
can you come over ?
please ?
look don' t move , okay ?
i' il be right over .
no , i' il be right there .
okay .
hi .
are you okay ?
terrific !
i came running right over .
i' m sorry .
i didn' t mean to call you so late .
no , it' s fine , it' s fine .
don' t worry about it .
what what' s going on ?
what' s wrong ?
everything .
what do you mean ?
me !
what do you mean , you ?
you you' re perfect .
i i am a loser !
you' re a world beater .
what are you talking about ?
i am a workaholic .
no , you' re not .
you
okay , yes , you are , you are , but you' re our workaholic , and we' re very proud of you .
so  brian ?
what ?
you' re my friend ... and if i ask you something , you' il answer me honestly , right ?
of course i will .
you know i will .
when you look at me , when you look at my life ... do you say to yourself , " now there' s a girl whose values are all out of whack " ?
no , and certainly not in that voice .
have i got no spirit ?
what ?
i don' t mean " spirit .
i know i' m fun to hang out with .
but , i mean , does my life seem shallow to you ?
am i spiritually empty ?
no .
are you are you crazy ?
you' ve got you' ve got more spirit in you than half the goofballs running around in robes out there .
what you' re a natural .
you radiate .
what
trust me .
what what' s going on here ?
what' s this really about ?
i don' t even know where to begin , brian .
you' re my best friend , and i have been keeping all this stuff from you .
all these feelings .
and , um , now , something has happened , and i can' t keep it from you any more .
i feel bad .
no , it' s okay .
i understand .
no , it' s not okay .
i have some things i have to tell you , and i feel bad .
i know , me too , me too .
i have things i gotta tell you too .
but mine are big .
no .
mine are really bad ...
no . and i think i need to get it off because
okay .
it' s okay .
oh , please , just listen .
i don' t
i love you too .
what ?
i love you .
that' s what you' re trying to say , but you' re scared because it' s me , and so i' m gonna say it first .
but
br brian , um  no , it' s okay .
trust me .
oh , brian .
trust me , trust me .
we can' t fight it .
it' s too strong .
what ?
it' s okay .
no , brian , i can' t !
it' s the vows , isn' t it ?
it' s the vows .
they make you feel guilty .
i can' t believe it .
god , i should have never had that sex talk with you on the bridge that day .
i knew it .
no .
i knew it .
in the back of my head was this little voice saying , " don' t go there .
she' s
brian , you don' t understand .
you wanna know something ?
right now , first time ever , i feel jealous of jake .
i envy him , you know , ' cause this would be so easy if i was him .
brian  i picked the wrong gig .
brian , let me talk to you .
come on , come on .
admit it .
if i wasn' t a priest , if i was a rabbi , you could fall in love with me without this guilt .
listen to me !
what ?
i' m in love with a rabbi .
sorry ?
i' m in love with jake .
yeah .
that' s what i was trying to tell you .
i' m i' m stunned .
i mean , i' m i' m i' m stunned .
i' m i' m i' m paralyzed .
what
excuse me .
my mouth just went all dry .
i
i can' t believe this .
when when did this this happen ?
we' ve been together since july .
july ?
oh !
ah .
july .
we knew we should have told you , but we just weren' t sure how you' d react ... and we thought it would be the better choice .
no , no , no .
i' m i' m glad you saved it , ' cause it' s definitely less weird for me now .
brian , could
brian !
come on .
let' s just talk about this .
you don' t drink .
excuse me , but i think in light of recent revelations ... neither of us is in a position to say what the other one does or does not do with much authority .
wouldn' t you say ?
oh , god !
you must think i' m such an idiot .
no , brian .
no , no , no .
i mean ...
i think i' m an idiot .
i mean , all these moments with you .
you know , i' ve been walking around on a cloud and ... it' s just been reflected glow off of you and jake .
that' s not true .
i' m so embarrassed .
i
god , talk about a bad case of the third wheel .
oh , brian .
it' s like i' m on some ... bad new aaron spelling show .
melrose priest .
no .

how' d you find out ?
how " is that the best you can do ?
how do you think ?
oh , she told you .

you know , did you think she was just gonna , like , take it on the chin for you ... after the way you treated her ?
oh , hey , hey , wait a minute .
no , you listen to me .
anna is very special , okay ?
she' s not like other girls .
and you said some things to her that i resent on her behalf .
you can' t you can' t just write her off like one of your dates , jake .
i won' t let you do it .
brian , i' m in love with her !
okay ?
i' m sorry that you found out about it this way .
it sucks , but the fact is that we have to work it out together .
it' s between me and her .
no , it was between you and her .
and then you mucked things up , and now it' s between you and me .
why is it between you and me ?
because i love her .
i know you love her .
i love her too .
no .
i' m in love with her .
what ?
yeah , it came as quite a shock to her too , believe me .
you' re in love with her ?
no one seems to have picked up on this .
it' s very strange .
i it' s just i mean , she' s like your sister , brian .
it' s
yes , thank you for adding new depth to my confusion .
damn it , jake , you have a whole city full of women , you know , at your feet .
you could go out with anyone you want to .
why did you have to go and hone in on the first woman i' ve ever had any real romantic feeling for ?
oh !
wait a minute !
listen to what you' re saying .
you' re telling me that i should have been sensitive to the possibility ... that a catholic priest had a crush on my secret girlfriend .
so what ?
so what ?
you know how much i care about her , and you could have guessed it would end up this way .
i mean , you know yourself .
i know myself ?
what does that mean ?
you' re always trying to have these casual flings and relationships ... and it never works because the women always fall in love with you ...
' cause you' re so smart and funny and cute and yada yada ...
what are hey .
hey !
hey ! and you know it !
hey , don' t put this all on me .
why ?
why ?
you could have had a fling with anybody , jake .
why did you have to pull anna into your bed ?
i didn' t pull her into my bed .
i don' t want to hear that .
i don' t believe that .
sorry .
it' s the truth .
she' s a woman .
she' s not the virgin mary !
ow !
um , let me get this straight .
i am talking to a priest ... who went on a bender because his best friend , a rabbi ... stole his girl .
right .
thank you .
i want to thank you for telling me this story .
why ?
because now i can retire .
you have to give me advice .
that' s what this is supposed to be about .
oh , god .
what do i know ?
i' m a ha if punjabi sikh ... one quarter tamil separatist .
my sister' s married to a jewish doctor from new jersey ... and our other grandmother ... was an irish nun who left me this bar , which is a very long story .
you' re a sikh catholic muslim with jewish in laws ?
yes .
yes .
it gets very complicated .
i' m reading dianetics .
i don' t blame you .
i thank you for listening to me .
i feel like i should ask you for my penance .
i don' t do penance .
i do shots .
i' il tell you what i know .
may those who love us love us .
and those who don' t love us ... may god turn their hearts .
and if he cannot turn their hearts ... may he turn their ankles ... so that we may know them by their limping .
i' il tell you why i
don' t wanna know where you are
i got a joke i been
dying to tell you
a silent kidis looking
down the barrel
to make the noise that i kept so quiet
kept it from you , pitseleh
anna ?
anna ?
hmm .
i' m not what' s missing
from your life now
i could never be the puzzle pieces
they say that god makes problems
just to see what you can stand
before you do as the devil pleases
give up the thing you love
hey , brian .
it' s me again .
please call me , okay , finn ?
brian , call anna .
please to call .
seriously .
i really wanna talk to you , okay ?
bye .
i remember i fell in love with this girl in prague .
was in 1968 .
she was beautiful .
she looked like carole lombard .
she grabbed me .
it was in the alley behind my church .
she pressed me against the wall .
she kissed me .
i felt like richard chamberlain in the thorn birds , you know ... in the barn with maggie .
i was so happy i could die .
you' ve never told me this .
what did anything happen between you ?
not really .
flirtations , little moments ... but then soon after the russians invaded czechoslovakia ... and i moved to the united states .
i don' t know .
i' il tell you something .
if she had kissed me back ...
i don' t think i' d be sitting here right now .
i would have given it all up .
i mean , she didn' t , but
i don' t know .
i just i keep thinking about what you said in the seminary ... about how , you know , the life of a priest is hard ... and if and if you can see yourself being happy doing anything else ... you should do that .
well well , that was my recruitment pitch ... which is not bad when you are starting out ... because makes you feel like , like a marine .
the truth is ... you can never tell yourself that there is only one thing you could be .
if you' re a priest or if you marry a woman ... it' s the same challenge .
you cannot make a real commitment ... unless you accept that it' s a choice ... that you keep making again and again and again .
i' ve been a priest over 40 years ... and i fell in love at least once every decade .
you' re not gonna tell me what to do here , are you ?
no .
god will give you your answer .
hey .
hey .
how you doin ' ?
well , what' s up ?
well , i know you' re probably still mad at me  " probably " ?
no , i' m definitely , definitely still mad , you know ?
okay  i hope you didn' t think you were just gonna stroll over here ... after a couple of weeks and find me in a good mood or something .
no .
i just said , " i know you' re probably still mad at me .
yeah , well , what do you expect , you know ?
i mean i mean , you should have just told me .
you should have just told me , ' cause i' d have said , " no , " and i' d have been jealous ... and told you it was gonna muck everything up , but at least we' d still have been friends .
we' re still friends .
jesus , i hope we' re still friends .
we well , friends don' t lie to each other ...
and set each other up to be humiliated like that , jake .
all right .
all right .
well , that' s why i' m here .
that' s why i wanted to , uh , apologize , if you let me talk for a second .
well , uh , i wanna talk , you know ?
i i' ve got all these things on my mind .
okay .
i wanna vent a little .
so talk !
let me vent .
vent !
come on .
vent .
go ahead .
vent .
okay .
well , now i lost my momentum .
so , so go ahead .
s well , say what do you wanna say ?
what ?
i wanted to say that i think i handled things really badly and i' m sorry .
you' re my best friend , and would you please forgive me ?
that was very simple and direct .
thank you .
you know , you' re lucky i am a priest ...
' cause forgiveness kind of comes with the job description .
well , you' re a good priest .
i got something for you .
i almost didn' t ' cause i was so mad at you , but this was too good .
holy shit .
that' s the rabbi schlomo schnurson rookie card .
this is like the last of the series .
i know .
you' ve been talking about this card for , like , 15 years .
it' s in such good condition too .
yeah , it' s mint .
this is like  mint .
i had to get it .
brian !
thank you .
well , you' re welcome .
you know , look .
as pissed off as i was , the weird thing is ...
i i' m very sorry i didn' t get to see you two together , you know ?
i think that would have made me really happy in some weird way .
so , have you talked to her ?
no , no .
i mean , things are really strange between us now .
i
what about you ?
are you guys talkin ' ?
are you workin ' this out or anything ?
no .
no .
but that' s kind of offset by the fact that i' m about to lose my job .
you serious ?
uh huh .
whew .
what a mess .
i' m sorry .
man , i was really starting to think i had a few things figured out there .
yeah , me too .
what happened ?
hi .
excuse me if i say that i don' t think i' m the person ... to offer objective advice on this particular confession .
brian .
brian .
you don' t have to say anything , okay ?
just listen to me .
i just want to say one thing , and then i will go away .
you' re my friend ... and whatever else is going on ...
i can' t have you out there thinking that my feelings for you ... are tied in to my feelings for jake .
that' s not the problem , and you know it .
i thought you wanted me .
and and that affected me .
i don' t know .
i i maybe that' s not fair , and i' m reading all kinds of things wrong ... but it sure felt that way to me .
i don' t know what to say .
i , um
i' ve just been having so much fun , and ...
i' ve been feeling all of these feelings lately ... and not just my feelings for jake .
but this ... reconnecting with this part of myself ... that has been shut down for a long time .
and if i indulge those feelings too much with you ... or if i took you for granted , i am so sorry .
i can' t bear that i hurt you .
ah , it' s not your fault .
i totally set myself up for this .
i' il tell you something , it' s i don' t know which feels worse .
having my heart broken ... or starting to doubt myself because of what that means for me .
don' t you dare doubt yourself .
you have a gift , and you know it ... and if you start to doubt that because of me ...
brian , i don' t know what i would do with myself .
i don' t doubt myself because of you .
i i feel like the best version of myself around you ... and that makes me doubt everything else .
i don' t know what to do , brian .
just tell me what to do , and i will do it .
is it me , or is confession getting a little touchy feely these days ?
thank you .
okay .
all right , the lights are workin ' , cameras came ... chairs are all set up the way we want ' em now .
okay , i sent the invitations out yesterday .
we' ve got the karaoke machine .
oh , no , no .
what ?
we need the discs for the karaoke .
i we i have to call don .
i' il do it when i get home .
well , that' s all right .
do it now .
excuse me .
wh what is that ?
it' s a cell phone .
since when ?
since anna gave it to me .

are you sure you don' t want to talk about this ?
yes , i don' t !
it' s weird to me .
we haven' t talked about this .
am i asking you ?
i don' t want to talk about it .
i would talk about it if i wanted to talk about it .
okay .
i just think that she' s leaving next week .
brian , i know .
so if you' re gonna deal with this , you' d better do it soon .
what do you want me to do ?
it' s not
oh .

dr marks .

your mother collapsed .
she suffered a transient ischemic attack .

the doctor said two days  two days ?

if i have to stay here for two days , i' il give them an ischemic wh whatever the hell i had .
i assume your brother knows all about this .
yeah , he' s , um , he' s stuck in the hamptons ... but he' s he' s checking in and , and
yeah .
okay .
well , doesn' t matter .
i' il be home by tomorrow .
thanks , guys , for being so dutiful .
it' s our pleasure .
so where' s the third musketeer , miss reilly ?
hmm ?
workin ' hard ?

you know what ?
um , i i need a cup of coffee .
i' il get it .
no , that' s okay .
i' m gonna get it .
you guys stay and talk .
what happened ?
look , mom , i don' t want you to worry about this , okay ?
everything' s gonna be fine .
i' ve dealt with it .
" dealt with it " ?
you dealt with what ?
i dealt with it .
it' s over , and i don' t
i wanna talk to you about this .
no , we don' t have to talk about it .
i wanna talk to you about this !
i think you should rest .
there' s there' s nothing to talk about .
yes , there is .
no , there isn' t .
there is .
sit back .
relax .
listen to me .
there' s a reason why your brother isn' t here .
yeah , i know , i know .
no , you don' t know .
no , i know ...
no , you don' t . and i' m not gonna let that happen again .
you don' t know !
i made a mistake .
it' s true , he' s punishing me a little too much for it ... but it was my fault .
it' s hard to see your son as a man .
i couldn' t do that for him .
you' re a man , jake .
you' re a good man .
i did a good job with you .
make your own decisions about what' s important to you .
i' m proud of you no matter what .
mom .
i love you .
thank you .
rabbi .
larry .
how' s your mother , jake ?
she' s good .
she' s , uh she' s actually here tonight .
oh .
that' s wonderful .
so i suppose you have your speech all prepared .
yeah .
yeah .
good .
good .
then you' il go out with a bang , huh ?
shalom .
since , uh , yom kippur ... is kind of like the super bowl of the jewish calendar ... most rabbis try to cram a whole year' s ... worth of sermons into one kind of big " best of " sermon .
um , i' m not gonna do that tonight .
i' m not gonna talk about the meaning of god ... or the situation in israel ... or the status of jews around the world .
i' m i' d like to talk about something a little more personal .
i' d like to talk about us .
the status of you and me .
a wise man once told me that no rabbi can save anyone .
he can only offer himself as a guide to other fearful people .
we live in a really complex world ... a world where boundaries and definitions are blurring ... and bleeding into each other in ways that that i think challenge us not just as jews but as human beings .
and for a while now , you' ve let me be your guide .
you' ve , uh
you' ve shared your lives with me .
you' ve explored your faith with me ... in ways that i know sometimes have seemed a little strange ... and , and maybe even a little scary ... but you put your trust in me ... and over the past few months ...
i have been violating that trust .
i' ve been violating it because i haven' t been sharing my life with you .
for a number of months , i' ve been seeing a woman who isn' t jewish .
it doesn' t matter if i' m still with her , which i' m not , or if i still love her , which i do , very much .
what matters is that i shouldn' t have been afraid to discuss it with you .
i' m not sorry for loving her .
i am sorry i' m very sorry that i put too little faith in you .
yom kippur is the day of atonement .
and so tonight i stand before you ...
and ask you to forgive me .
this could take a while , jake .
go home .
i i' il call you as soon as the board makes a decision .
or you could stick around .
okay ?
come on .
come on .
yes ?
yes .
yes !
oh !
oh !
god , don' t mess with me like that , you  well , i couldn' t
oh .
oh .
oh !
it' s so fantastic .
a made rabbi .
how does it feel ?
feels good .
god .
you know , we got a lot to celebrate tonight ... barring an interfaith rumble at our opening .
i know .
it' s definitely manischewitz time .
hey , we got two cases delivered , by the way .
oh !
did you , uh , get the discs from don ?
no , i' m going to .
don' t worry , but , look , not to rain on your parade ...
i just i had to go and say goodbye to anna ' cause she' s leaving tonight ...
oh . which i know you know and don' t want to talk about , but there it is , you know ?
yeah , i don' t .
there what is ?
come on !
come on , man .
what are you doing ?
what do you want me to do , flagellate myself ?
jews don' t do that .
we we plant trees .
listen , who' s talking about feeling guilty ?
i' m i' m i' m saying , you know , you' re
i just think you' d want to do something about it .
you' re on such a roll right now .
what
what could possibly be holding you back at this point ?
y you do love her , don' t you ?
yes , i do .
i just i just
i mean , come on .
sometimes that' s not enough , all right ?
not what are listen to what you' re saying !
not enough " ?
there there' s nothing else that' s worth anything against that , and you know it .
i mean , for years i have listened to you to you talk about ... how much you want something exactly like this to happen to you ... and and when it comes , you you walk away from it over a few very minor complications .
now , what what kind of a plan is that ?
you you know how god works .
well , you think he' s just gonna drop a gift like that in your lap a second time around ... just ' cause you happen to be one of his crew , you know ?
seriously .
look at me .
i' m
i' m your friend , and i' m telling you , you are making this too complicated .
it' s a very simple situation .
you' re in love with her .
she' s in love with you , and she is leaving in about two hours .
you need to ask yourself a simple question .
are you gonna do anything about it or not ?
what the why are you standing here ?
oh , my god .
you' re right .
what am i doing ?
what am i doing standing here ?
sign hasn' t changed .
oh , my god .
this is new york city .
who waits for a sign ?
what cross the damn street !
what , do we all need signs to tell us what to do now ?
