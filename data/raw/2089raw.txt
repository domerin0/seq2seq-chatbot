welcome to the infantry , gentlemen .
no matter where you did your basic , either fort polk or elsewhere . . . . . . rest assured that we train the proudest , the toughest . . . . . . the best equipped soldiers .
this base is the largest supplier of combat troops overseas .

i shit you not , gentlemen .
you are headed for a two way firing range .
you will be sent to the war .
you will be here for an eight week training cycle .
after that , you will remain here for a week more .
we will ship you to an outpost 1 0 miles from here . . . . . . that is known throughout the army as the second worst place on earth .
tigerland .
it is the stateside province of vietnam . . . . . . and it is as close to the war as we can make it .
now , gentlemen , it behooves you to learn . . . . . . what little we can teach you here .
for if you do , then maybe . . . . . . just maybe . . . . . . you will return one day to play stink finger with sally back home .

charlie 6 , this is charlie 2 .
miter has properly demonstrated . . . . . . the use of the ta 31 2 field radio .
except for this , which is not in the manual .
if you ever catch charlie . . . . . . you might want info on where the rest of his buddies is .
only charlie is a close lipped bastard who won' t tell you fuck all .
that' s why you tie his gook hands , take down his gook pants . . . . . . and grab his gook balls .
here , miter , hold these .
you pinch these clips on each of his slant eyed nuts . . . . . . and you juice up the radio . . .
. . . that' il send enough shock so he' il tell you anything you want .
hell , he' il tell you the minor league baseball scores .
you read me ?
yes , sergeant .
he' il tell you how his mother wipes her ass if you give him this juice .
not only that , you' il be able to find him real easy next time .
because he' il light up the fucking night .
no one said you could leave .

out here , you' re challenged on guard duty .
and you do it by the book .
but in nam , if you hear something in the bushes . . . . . . i mean anything , you open fire .
you fire into those bushes until you kill whatever made that sound .
when the sun comes up , i don' t give a fuck . . . . . . whether it' s man , woman , child or little johnny next door .
kill it or you' re not coming home .
like the my lai massacre , sergeant ?
paxton . . . . . . why don' t you join your asshole buddy ?

they' d have cut us in two !
who told you to open your fucking mouth ?
miter' s platoon guide !

ls that clear ?
yes , sir .
if you want these dumb ass bitches dead . . . . . . you wouldn' t take them in the belly of a pig . . . . . . with a 762 to split their skull !
you flank the objective !
you read me ?
yes , sergeant !
get these fucking men out the hole !

private bozz , reporting as ordered .
at ease .
so you' re the new platoon guide for 2nd platoon ?
yes , sir .
the fucking world is full of fucking surprises .
it wasn' t your plan to wear sergeant' s stripes . . . . . . a week away from tigerland in a war .
i don' t know , sir .
the idea crossed my mind now and again .
i just didn' t think it would all be so pitiful sad .
been looking over your 201 .
you' re a texas boy .
couple run ins with the law .
a year in state college .
dropout , worked construction .
get drafted ?
yes , sir .
why didn' t you stay in school ?
maybe i needed some trouble , sir .
well , you got it .
you also got responsibility .
you got a platoon to run .
the company' s like the bad end of a shit storm .
your platoon' s the worst .
thank you , sir .
that' s not a compliment , smart ass .
i don' t want any more calls from battalion . . . . . . asking me why this troopie needs a hardship discharge . . . . . . and that troopie needs some kind of a mental wet nurse .
you understand me ?
yes , sir .
wipe that fucking grin off your face .
a week from now you' il ship out to tigerland .
that' il crawl in your skull and look out your eyes .
so let' s start fresh .
give your people a weekend pass .
already done it , sir .
you are a goddamn piece of work , bozz .
i believe you could soldier as well as any man in this army .
i even think you want to , but you won' t .
i' m just trying to keep myself alive .
we' re fighting a war , private .
nobody knows how he' s gonna come back .
that' s not the kind of alive i' m talking about , sir .
here' s 1 50 bucks .
happy halloween !
cough it up , brian .
next time , pax .
catch you later , buddy .
all right .
who' s that girl you' re talking to , bozz ?
trying to score some weed .
know what i don' t get ?
why they haven' t tossed you out on some lunatic discharge . . . . . . some bullshit like that .
i ain' t crazy .
you' re out of your fucking mind .
my reasons are my reasons and no one has to like them .
what about these fucking war games ?
what if it' s a lie ?
what if the guys who tell you and me shit to do were lied to also ?
maybe since everyone believes in the same mistake , you know . . . . . . maybe they' re all as confused as we are .
all this " boy' s boy , man' s man " bullshit .
ever feel you' re just being stupid ?
yeah .
and it gives me a warm , gooey feeling inside too .
oh , man , we need women , pax !
we need song and prayers to the moon and deep breaths of the night wind .
oh , i hear you , buddy !
i hear your asshole' s tighter than a migraine .
fuck you !
hey , man .
you' re bozz , right ?
uh huh .
fellas say that if you don' t want to go to nam . . . . . . you better pray to jesus or talk to roland bozz .

thought a grenade went off .
how was yours ?
expensive .
you feel guilty ?
because i' m broke ?
i figured you for a guy who left a sweetheart back home .
she left me .
that' s why you joined the army .
go on , confess .
no , she broke it off when i enlisted .
didn' t want to be a widow .
she' s got a point .
after all this bullshit . . . . . . you still want to go kill women and children in rice paddies ?
come on , paxton !
where you going , bozz ?
i have no idea .
fuck .
we are gonna jump , my young friend !
shit , bozz , i' m too drunk .
come on , paxton .
i' il break my neck .
i don' t want to go without you , man .
all right , i see what this is .
this jump , it' s like this existential leap of faith .
abso fucking lutely .
i have no idea what that means .
we' il break those legs and get out of the war .
okay , let' s go .
that' s it , here we go .
i' m ready .

if i told you about people who can get us to mexico . . . . . . away from the war , would you go ?
no .
no , i wouldn' t .
i enlisted , so there' s a place for me .
if i don' t go , somebody has to take that place .
and if they die , well . . . . . . they' re dying for me .
you' re a brave man .

hope you' re not too disappointed .
what do you want to do ?
how about get wilson as far the fuck away as possible , sir ?
well , you have the right to press for a court martial .
otherwise , you can let us handle it our way .
i' d personally prefer that option .
consider it a personal favor to me .
get wilson out , sir .
i don' t recall telling you to open your stinkhole .
he' s right , sir .
wilson shouldn' t be in the army .
even if he did try to kill somebody .
you and i need to exchange some ideas .
that doesn' t solve our problem .
we need to get him out now or we' il file for a court martial .
paxton , you' re dismissed .
yes , sir .
he' s learning .
bozz , do you think the army' s never seen pissants like you before ?
i know you think you' re some big swinging dick hero .
i know a lot of the men think so too .
but i know you for what you are .
you are a coward .
you' re a born leader and you' re afraid to take any real responsibility !
that' s why you dropped out of school , why you drop out of everything !
you' re pissing your life away !
i don' t need the fucking army . . . . . . and i don' t need the war to tell me that , sir !
get on your feet , soldier .
attention !
i don' t want you in a stockade .
i don' t want you recycled .
i don' t want you drummed out on some bad conduct discharge .
i want you exactly where you are .
and we' il just naturally chew you up .
i' il take care of wilson .

good riddance to bad rubbish .
shut your fucking mouth .

you' il move by chopper to secure any area deemed necessary .
you' il be allowed one hour' s sleep .
minor mistakes will pay back major punishment .
maybe you' ve heard we' ve lost this war .
or we' ve lost the support of people here at home .
it' s too late to ask those questions .
you' re not back on the block .
you' re alive in a year , we' il talk about it .
when you arrive in nam . . . . . . it' s important to get acclimated as quickly as you can .
remember to think .
you understand me ?
yes , sergeant !
what matters now is sharpening your ability to find and destroy the enemy .
practice how to stay alive .
i know what you' re thinking .
i' ve been there myself .
you' re thinking you' il go somewhere safe .
you' il luck out .
tigerland is where you stop bullshitting yourself .
sarge , you got any advice on how to stay alive in vietnam ?
i do , private .
don' t go .
right on , right on .
my friend here wants the experience .
says he ain' t scared .
well , good luck .
if you ask me , i' il stick with the smart and the scared .
you' il be under the care of ncos and officers who were in combat .
listen to them .
they know what they' re talking about .

i had a best buddy , kelly morgan . . . . . . that i went to alt with .
in ' 67 , when the call came , we got sent off to nam .
we had only been in country a few days .
we was green as grass .
we were in a two man listening post , talking just like we are here .
kelly lit up a cigarette .
one minute we' re naming his unborn child . . . . . . and the next second his brains were in my lap .
the sniper zeroed in on the cherry of his cigarette , bozz .
gentlemen , it' s all about respect .
respect for your superiors and what they' re trying to teach you .
respect for yourselves and your unit .
and most important . . .
. . . respect the enemy .
you have 42 minutes . . . . . . then the squad' s on patrol .
fuck .
gentlemen , this is the best vietnamese village we could create for you . . . . . . here on the base !
now , listen .
you' re all gooks , so nobody speaks english .
anybody asks you a question in english , you answer , " no bic .
it means , " i don' t speak " in gook ese .
let' s hear it .
