here , are you starting again ?
what if i am ?
what if the police come ?
let ' em .
the windows are steamed up , the doors are locked .
it' s like a turkish bath .
it don' t half make you thirsty .
here !
watch your ring with my stockings .
move over a bit , then .
get your knee off the wheel !
i can' t .
i' m stuck .
look out .
i' il do it .
that hurt !
i told you to be careful with your legs .
i was only trying to be helpful .
i can help myself .
hello .
they never make these cars big enough , do they ?
well , you all settled in ?
we can begin .
my name is ...
alfie ?
alfie .
i suppose you think you' re going to see the bleeding titles now .
well , you' re not , so relax .
what time will your old man be at the station ?
never mind him .
that' s who i will mind .
never spoil a good thing .
you women don' t get that .
enough' s as good as a feast .
you' ve changed your tune .
that horn put me off .
i hate noise at a time like that .
eh , mate ?
don' t forget your napkin .
the first time you put your hankie over your shoulder ,
i thought you were going to play your fiddle .
i come from a musical family .
here .
mind you don' t catch cold .
i' ve had a lovely time , alfie .
a married woman .
every one of ' em in need of a good laugh .
it never strikes their husbands .
make a married woman laugh and you' re halfway there with her .
it don' t work with the single bird .
it' d start you off on the wrong foot .
you get one of them laughing , you won' t get nothing else .
just listen to it .
it was dead glum when i met it tonight .
i listened to its problems , then i got it laughing .
it' il go home happy .
where' d you tell your husband you were ?
pictures with olive .
what pictures ?
just the pictures .
never be vague .
it plants suspicion .
no wonder there' s all this broken marriage and divorce .
it would never occur to him that another man would wanna take me out .
no , i see what you mean .
suck this sweet so he don' t smell the gin .
i don' t care if he does .
be human .
why should we hurt him ?
he' s done us no harm .
you want everybody happy .
i don' t believe in making anybody unhappy if i don' t have to .
or in making an enemy .
you could be crossing the sahara , and he' d be the bloke you met .
what about next week ?
same time , same place ?
maybe .
i' il go and get my ticket .
she don' t know we won' t be seeing much more of her .
she' s on her way out .
when a married woman gets too hot on , it' s time to cool off .
next thing she' il want is to introduce me to the husband .
i can see it coming .
i' il say good night to you , girl .
the firm' s dance is on saturday .
i' il treat you .
won' t your old man be there ?
yeah , i' d like you to meet .
night .
don' t forget your napkin .
i' m like the boy scouts , always prepared .
once i' ve met the husband , it don' t half put me off the wife .
he could be dying , but if i ain' t met him , i won' t think about him .
it' s once you meet .
like as not , he' il turn out to be a good sport .
his sort usually are .
as i' m having it off with her ,
i keep thinking about him hanging up his shirts .
or arguing in the pub about football or cricket .
you get a lot of his sort , chelsea supporters .
hello .
had a nice time , dear ?
not bad at all .
good film ?
there was a queue , so we didn' t wait .
we went to a restaurant .
did you enjoy yourself ?
that' s the main thing .
well , i did my best .
what about you ?
i went through that garden catalogue that came .
very interesting .
you should go out more .
you come back so cheerful made over again .
now i' m off to visit a little bird called gilda .
while she ain' t exactly stupid , she is a bit on the simple side .
she' d never make a number one .
you couldn' t take her out and show her off .
she ain' t an exciting dresser , but she' s a cracking little stand by .
and for another thing , she ain' t a liberty taker .
most birds go mad to get hold of a bloke and then go about changing him .
i told gilda from the start that i ain' t the marrying sort .
do you know what ?
she don' t mind .
she' s a stand by and she knows it .
any bird that knows its place in this world can be quite content .
alfie ? !
did you forget your key ?
humphrey , it' s you .
yeah .
i' m sorry for coming round so late , but i was just passing by .
yes , i see .
i' d just finished work and i was feeling a bit lonely , so i thought i' d pop in .
yes , i see .
have i come at an awkward time ?
i am expecting alfie any minute .
there' s a pong in here !
it' s phul nana .
the scent of araby .
don' t you like it ?
no .
i like things to smell natural .
i' ve got your meal ready .
never push things at me as soon as i come in .
like to get my bearings .
just as you like it .
that' s enough of that , an ' all .
i saw that geezer humphrey going off .
here .
you' re not having it off with him , are you ?
alfie , i can' t bear another man to come near me since i met you .
i just wondered .
did he just call to give you these chocolates , then ?
no .
he called to tell me he loved me .
love you ?
some men are funny .
alfie , do you love me ?
well , shall we say i like you a lot .
ah , well , i will have that grub after all .
hot water bottle ?
she' s getting a bit previous .
hello .
is today the 22nd ?
yeah , i think so .
shouldn' t our little friend have arrived on the 19th ?
don' t worry , he' il turn up .
he always has done .
he' s usually so punctual .
i had a really good day at the caf .
i took over 50 on the till .
isn' t that wonderful ?
what' s so wonderful ?
it ain' t your money .
i like to think of them doing well .
it keeps me busy .
it' s time you started that fiddle , playing the piano on the till .
alfie , i couldn' t .
that' s the only till in london that ain' t bent .
luigi and his wife treat me like family .
all the more reason to do ' em .
alfie , i' m happy as i am .
you could still be happy with a few hundred quid in the bank .
now , look .
the one thing you' ve got to get into that head of yours is that nobody helps you in this life .
you' ve got to help yourself .
if you fiddled five bob a day , you' d have 200 nicker on one side by now .
money isn' t everything .
only people who ain' t got none say that .
i' ve had a fiddle on every job i' ve done .
a fiddle gives you an interest in your work .
i believe that everybody should take an interest in their work .
there' s another little job done .
you sound cheerful , elkins .
some mornings , i feel chirpy .
yeah ?
not all that chirpy on what i' m paying you .
you must be working a nice fiddle .
that' s defamation of character .
i' il report you .
come off it .
how do you think i got where i am ?
i' m quite satisfied as long as you do the job well .
but don' t get greedy , otherwise you' il kill the goose .
i tumbled at once .
i shouldn' t whistle .
never be cheerful if you' re doing a fiddle .
you' re getting careless .
you can say that again .
little gilda , she' s pregnant .
no !
how long ?
couple of months .
you ain' t thinking of getting married ?
me , in my state of health ?
sorry , full up .
room for just one more inside .
humphrey , i' m glad it' s your bus .
are you ?
i haven' t seen you for so long .
you don' t need flinging down stairs to know you' re not welcome .
i' m sorry .
that' s alright .
i' ve missed our little chats .
have you ?
two six pennies , when you' ve got the time !
ta .
i' ve never seen you looking lovelier .
still can' t get you out of my mind .
how' s ...
how' s alfie these days ?
he' s fine .
mind you , it doesn' t hurt like it used to .
what doesn' t ?
the old heartache .
still , i wouldn' t be without it .
you haven' t got engaged or anything like that , have you ?
no , nothing like that .
he doesn' t rush into things , alfie .
i don' t expect you' il ever need me .
but if you do , i' il always be there .
bye , gilda .
god bless .
hello , alfie .
you' re late , girl .
i ran all the way .
any news ?
any reports from the front ?
no .
it doesn' t look like it .
we' ve got to do something about this little lot .
i' ve tried everything .
you' re taking stuff on the quiet ?
you don' t wanna make yourself ill .
alfie .
you' re getting cooey lately .
i' m sorry .
and in a way you' re more bossified , as if i' ve got to take notice of you , instead of you of me .
i can' t describe it , but i can feel it .
do you love me ?
what can i say when you ask ?
you shouldn' t ask , you know .
i' il tell you , when i feel like it .
i' il go and make the coffee .
yeah .
make it strong .
alfie , i was thinking .
why can' t we ... go through with it ?
what an ' orrible thought !
i' ve never been through with anything .
if i was to marry you , you' d gain a husband but lose a friend .
you don' t have to marry me .
i' ve got it worked out .
i don' t care .
think twice before you turn an innocent creature out .
i wouldn' t turn him out .
i' il have him adopted .
what are you talking about ?
well , by a rich woman , see ?
a rich woman ?
i' d like to do that much for him .
i' d be certain he' d have a good life , then .
steady on , girl .
you can' t be sure there' s something there yet .
this morning , i thought i felt him kick .
how can they kick ?
it won' t be the size of my thumbnail .
i' il tell you next time .
you won' t !
don' t give way to your impulses .
something a woman might think natural a bloke will find sickening .
mrs artoni at the caf called her husband every time their baby moved .
you don' t realise that men are more sensitive than women .
remember that big bird i' d dance with at the locarno ?
one sunday night she showed me her operation scar , from when she was a kid .
a long scar with white skin round it .
i got straight out of bed and put my clobber on .
what' s up with you ? " she says .
i' d sooner see a bleeding horror film , " i said , " than that .
alfie , please .
can i , you know , go through with it and have the baby ?
what you asking me for ?
it' s yours , isn' t it ?
nobody in this world has any right to stop you doing what you want to .
steady on , girl .
now , then .
don' t break your bleeding heart .
if you wanna do something and you think it' s right , you do it .
to hell with ' em .
mind my shirt .
now ...
she was quite happy them months she was carrying , which to my mind was out of place in a way , her not being married .
mind you , she came over quite beautified for a time , especially in the early months .
i told her .
i says , " blimey , girl , you ain' t as ugly as i thought .
anyway , her time comes and into the hospital she goes to have it .
i wasn' t there , so i didn' t know till they told me .
then , from all accounts , the kid comes out a treat .
right bang on the minute , you might say .
alfie ?
i didn' t see you there .
you look all different .
what do you mean ?
well , sort of mumsy .
i put my name down as mrs elkins .
was that alright ?
course it' s alright .
put your name down as who you like .
it' s a free country , isn' t it ?
i brought you some flowers , but i didn' t want to be seen carrying them .
that' s nice .
freesias !
how delightful .
i' il put them into a vase for you , mrs elkins .
what do you think of your son , mr elkins ?
my what ?
he hasn' t seen him yet .
here he is .
he' s the image of his father .
yes .
i can see more of me in him than you .
what are you gonna call him ?
i thought malcolm alfred .
malcolm bleeding alfred ?
he' il never forgive you if you give him a name like that !
here , he' s moving .
quick , you better take him .
the mistake i made with gilda was getting involved .
i was having a beautiful little life and i couldn' t see it .
there was this manageress of a dry cleaner' s .
and i was getting a suit cleaned in the bargain . well , you can' t turn something like that down .
then , there was a chiropodist from a foot comfort service
i was having it off with .
she cut my corns handsome .
i never had my feet in such lovely condition .
i was hopping about like a little fairy .
she' s got a little ginger moustache , but i find i' m quite willing to overlook the odd blemish in a woman , provided she' s got something else to make up for it .
well , that' s why we' re here to help one another out in this life .
then there was dora , a little bird from pimlico
i had it off with mondays and wednesdays when her young man was at his body building classes .
and , on top of them , there was always the odd bird that came my way by chance .
what a lovely baby .
is it yours ?
no , no , it' s my sister' s .
so why i had to get involved with gilda , i do not know .
what' s that brown round his mouth ?
a bar of chocolate i gave him .
alfie , you shouldn' t !
you smell a bit milkified .
i' m sorry , alfie , i' il have a wash .
no , i don' t mind , it smells mumsy .
how long will you do the breast feeding caper ?
as long as i can .
it' s the best thing for him .
don' t let yourself get too attached to him .
why not ?
i' m his mother .
and i' m his father , but you' ve gotta be fair .
you' ve gotta think of him .
what about this rich woman ?
what rich woman ?
the one who was gonna adopt him , so he' d have a chance in life .
i' ve got to think about it .
i can' t rush into it .
make up your mind quick .
why should i ?
he might get so drawn to you ,
it' il fret his heart out when they take him away .
who says they' il take him away ?
that' s what you said .
you were gonna get him adopted so he' d want for nothing .
that was a long time ago .
you know what you' ve had , don' t you , girl ?
you' ve had a change of heart .
i can see it in your face .
what about it ?
haven' t you ever had one ?
yes , but i' ve always resisted it .
lying in hospital feeding him brought it on .
i could see your face changing .
coming over all mumsy .
i' m not ashamed of it .
but you' ve got to think of him .
you could never bring him up like this rich woman could .
we' il see .
i' m going back to work next week .
she could really take care of him .
dress him handsome .
who says i can' t dress him proper ?
look at that lovely shawl , and the things for him in that drawer .
you can' t learn him to talk nice .
not like this rich woman could .
i can if i try hard .
not proper , you can' t . he' il be " bleeding " this and that and worse .
i won' t let him .
these are dry , you can use ' em .
who' il look after him when you go back to the caff ?
i' m not going back .
i' il work in the brewery .
it' s better paid .
lugging bleeding beer crates about ?
when will you learn some sense ?
who will look after him while you' re at the brewery ?
a woman called mrs tippet .
she' s got four children of her own and she' il look after him from monday morning till friday teatime .
and i' il have him all the weekend .
i think that' s best for him .
and what about ... and what about me ?
you think i' il spend my weekends dodging under wet nappies ?
you won' t leave us , alfie ?
not now ?
i' il have to think about it .
please !
i won' t ever ask you for anything , not a farthing .
but don' t leave us now .
if you do ...
don' t talk like that .
i haven' t said i' il leave you .
i had to speak up .
i don' t think you' re doing right by that kid .
but i will .
i' il look after him .
i' il never neglect him .
never .
i' m only telling you the truth as i see it .
you won' t leave us , will you ?
promise me , alfie .
promise !
let go .
don' t ruckle my sleeve .
i ain' t a savage .
i ain' t gonna scarper .
but don' t start crying , either .
i' il belt you one for sure .
i don' t feel up to it .
don' t jump up to him at once .
it don' t do .
you' il grow more attached to each other , and he won' t go to mrs tippet .
here , mate .
that' s enough of that .
i' il give you something to cry for .
come on now .
there you are .
all you need is a father' s voice .
he' s got a hard life in front of him .
don' t give him any wrong impression from the start .
now , about this little kid of mine .
he turns out to be a real quick ' un .
and he don' t half love it when i play games with him .
never wants his mother , always asking for his father .
very soon , i find i' m getting quite attached to him .
know what i mean ?
that' s something i always guard against .
because sooner or later that' s gonna bring you some pain .
so if a bird ain' t got you one way , she' s got you another .
that' s the trouble .
once you get a kid in your life , it ain' t your own .
look at the things you have to do .
next , please .
well , you can' t be too careful , not with hereditary .
no smoking , please .
queer job for a bird , photographing people' s insides .
chin on the top , please .
hands on hips .
shoulders forward .
what' s she think i am , a bleeding contortionist ?
nice hands , though .
firm but gentle .
know what i mean ?
i wouldn' t mind her giving me a ...
hold it .
next , they' il be taking pictures of what you' re thinking .
there' il be some x certificates knocking around .
sorry i' m late .
there was a traffic jam at piccadilly .
it' s alright , you' re here now .
i brought you some cherries .
you shouldn' t have done .
well , we never got that rain they promised us .
doesn' t look like it .
you had a hard morning ?
the usual .
i don' t like you working on that brewery bay .
it' s no job for a woman .
you get used to it .
what' s that ?
that ring i was talking about .
it' s heavy !
22 carat .
solid gold .
same as i say that was my mother' s .
they don' t make rings like that today .
they made ' em to last then .
can i try it on ?
yeah , go on .
er , no .
no , sorry , but it' s bad luck .
once you put a wedding ring on , you should never take it off .
that' s what they say .
i don' t know if there' s anything in it .
humphrey ?
how would you feel ... bringing up another man' s child ?
have a cherry ?
you mean little malcolm ? well , i mean ...
once we were married , i could only look on him as my own child .
i' d try to be a good father to him , if he' d have me .
here .
look , can i have this ?
come on , darling , have a little bit of the lady' s sandwich .
just a little bit .
come on , darling .
i won' t hurt you .
just a little bit .
come on .
good boy .
i must go .
i shall be late for work .
will you think over what i said last wednesday ?
i' ve been thinking it over .
i' ll tell it to you for the last time , malcolm .
then you' ve gotta go to bye byes .
abou ben adhem , may his tribe increase , awoke one night from a dream of peace .
and saw within the moonlight in his room , making it rich and like a lily in bloom , an angel writing in a book of gold ...
what' s a angel ?
you know what an angel is .
i told you .
they' re on guard , up in heaven , all round god .
exceeding peace had made ben adhem bold ...
who' s ben adhem ?
he' s the man it' s all happening to .
now , shut your eyes and listen , malcolm .
lie down , and don' t ask questions .
and to the presence in the room he said ,
' what writest thou ? '
the vision raised its head , and , with a look made of all sweet accord , answered , ' the names of those who love the lord . '
what a lad .
he could hardly keep his eyes open , but he wouldn' t give in .
know what ?
he went off just like that .
he' il be a real handful in a few months ' time .
we' il have to be careful what we say in front of him .
he' s as sharp as a needle .
wait till he sees that teddy bear i bought for his birthday .
it' s about that size .
ever so soft .
the bloke who sold it to me said it was a real rich kid' s teddy .
here , do you fancy an hour' s kip , girl , while he' s asleep ?
cloth ears !
i' m talking to you .
humphrey' s been to see me twice this week at lunch time .
what' s he after ?
a bit on the side ?
nothing like that .
we just talked a bit .
don' t tell me what you talked about , because i don' t want to know !
one thing i can' t bear to hear about is a bird and a bloke having innocent talks together .
i think it' s more intimate than the other .
what is he after ?
he wants to marry me .
what did you tell him ?
that i' d talk it over with you .
why talk it over with me ?
you' re a free agent .
malcolm needs a father .
what do you think i am ?
i don' t mean just a weekend father , i mean a proper father .
yeah , well , we all need proper fathers .
and proper mothers , too , come to that .
it seems there' s just not enough to go around these days .
i don' t love him .
i don' t know what love is , the way you birds talk about it .
but i respect him .
well , you' d better marry him , then , hadn' t you ?
you' ve got young buster in there to think about .
i' il be seeing you .
maybe .
daddy !
daddy !
nice , isn' t it ?
goes like a bomb , too .
this car hire firm i' m working for , they have all the best stuff .
know where i' m off to now ?
pick up a party of publicans , take ' em to brighton for the races .
you' ve gotta get out and enjoy yourself .
once a bloke starts thinking about a bird he' s finished with , well , there' s a waste of time for you .
i' m not picking ' em up till 11 : 30 , so i' m popping in here .
it' s that x ray .
didn' t come out right or something .
load of red tape , if you ask me .
tilt forward , please .
thank you .
you' ve done this before , haven' t you ?
thank you .
have you been worrying about anything lately , mr elkins ?
who , me ?
no , i' m not the worrying sort .
you know what ?
gilda' s only decided to marry this humphrey geezer .
do you find you get tired easily ?
no , i' m always full of energy .
i got a letter from her , see ?
i don' t love him , " she says , " but i do respect him .
i don' t want no bird' s respect .
i wouldn' t know what to do with it .
step on the scales , please .
i haven' t got much time .
she' s told me time and again she loves me .
loves me for myself , whatever that means .
have you lost any weight ?
no , i always weigh 12 stone six .
have done for years .
but i' ve never told her i love her .
except when you' ve gotta say something for appearances ' sake .
11 stone nine pounds .
get out of it !
you sure these scales are right ?
this suit don' t weigh nothing .
nine ounces , lightweight .
it' s the new terylene and mohair .
you don' t feel as though you' ve got nothing on at all .
the one thing i never do with a woman , i never ...
would you take your shirt off , please ?
would you take your shirt off , please ?
i never crawl to one .
they either take me as i am or not at all .
do you perspire ?
i mean , do you sweat much ?
sweat ?
no .
tell a lie , i did sweat last sunday at the locarno .
but i was dancing , and i' d had a few beers .
i use a deodorant under my armpits .
just rub it on .
quite good , they are .
i see .
do you ever sweat at night ?
at night ?
you mean in bed ?
yes , in bed .
come to think of it , i did sweat a lot last night .
i couldn' t for the life of me understand why .
sit there with your back to me , please .
now take a deep breath .
now breathe out slowly .
she said , " malcolm will be alright .
i' ll be home to look after him .
again .
a good deep one .
hold it .
let it out .
what about you ? " she said .
won' t you miss us ?
say 99 .
99 .
i came over quite choked at that .
again .
whisper it this time .
99 .
whisper it again .
99 .
course i managed before ...
i managed before i met her and i' il manage now she' s gone .
do you ever feel any back pain ?
pain ?
no .
you know what ?
last week , i find i' m missing her , so i calls ...
funny , i do feel some pain there now .
where ?
there ?
no , a bit to the left .
there ?
no , higher up .
there ?
yeah , there .
is it tender ?
it is when you mess it about .
turn around , please .
yeah , so i calls round , you see .
she wouldn' t let me in .
she kept me at the door .
take a deep breath .
but little malcolm kept yelling " daddy ! " so she had to let me in .
breathe out .
she wouldn' t let me touch her .
she drew back for the first time .
99 .
100 .
what ?
99 .
yeah , she drew back .
sorry , but i' m playing fair by humphrey , the way i' ve always played fair by you .
do you cough much ?
cough ?
no .
only in the mornings , but everyone does after the first smoke .
fair by me ?
she never wanted no other geezer when she was with me .
what playing fair was that ?
bleeding sauce !
bring anything up when you cough ?
no .
i just clear my chest .
that' s the point of coughing .
bring something up , clear the tubes .
now , the pair of ' em have taken my little son from me .
there are times when i can still hear him calling " daddy ! " after me .
do you find you get quickly irritable of late ?
funny you should ask .
i do find i do my nut very easily these days .
do you sleep well ?
like a top .
the moment my head hits the pillow , i' m off .
i never wake up till ...
till when , mr elkins ?
i never used to wake up till it was time to get up .
that' s elkins with an s.
you know what i mean ?
i think so .
and now ?
i wake up dead on the same time .
four o' clock in the morning .
that is , no matter how much i' ve had to drink or ...
can i be perfectly frank with you ?
certainly .
no matter who' s beside me .
you know what i mean ?
yes , i understand .
thank you .
i never have been partial to these all night sessions .
for one thing , i' ve rarely found a woman ...
you don' t mind if i come out with it straight ?
you can tell me everything .
very few birds can get into my rhythm of sleeping .
i see .
i find myself lying there in the dark staring at the ceiling .
i keep thinking about this kid i used to know .
i was friendly with his mother .
nothing special , just an ordinary girl .
but i knew him well , the child .
there' s something i must tell you .
aii i wanted was for her to come back with little malcolm , so we could spend our sundays together .
but she never come .
do you understand me ?
yes , perfectly .
now .
if you lose a bird , you can always replace her .
but with a child , it' s different .
they' re each one themselves .
each one' s got his different nature .
i may not be the best dad in the world , but i am his real dad .
credit where credit' s due .
there' s something i must tell you .
he' s come out of these loins .
what do you wanna tell me ?
look at this .
they can' t get away from it .
he' s my son .
this is your x ray , mr elkins .
blimey !
is that me ?
yes , it is .
i' m just a load of old ribs !
i' m afraid there are two shadows on your lungs .
shadows on my lungs ?
what are you talking about ?
look at this patch .
you' ve got an infection here .
and one here .
an infection ?
i can' t have !
i ain' t been with nobody !
it' s not a question ...
you have to do something about it .
we can deal with it .
i want the best attention there is .
i' il even pay for it .
it' s just a question of rest .
that' s all you need .
i can' t rest .
i' m off to brighton with licentious victuallers !
we' re in for a blow out .
it' s booked !
it has to be unbooked .
you need rest in the country .
i hate the country .
how can you rest with all that bleeding dawn chorus ?
what' s the matter ?
my feet feel like lead .
the sweat' s pouring off me !
mr elkins , do keep calm .
these are only shadows .
shadows ?
on my lungs ?
i' m being eaten away !
this is the end of me !
god in heaven , help me !
good afternoon , mr elkins .
good afternoon .
here , once you know you ain' t gonna die , funny how soon you pull back to normal .
i used to think money was everything .
if you' ve got money , i used to say , you can have beautiful birds , handsome suits , a car of your own .
but those things ain' t a bit of use without good health .
hello , harry .
not come yet ?
she' s run off with the milkman .
here , see this chap here ?
his name' s harry clamacraft .
he' s 35 years old , married , with three kids .
he' s sitting in bed waiting for his wife , lily , to visit .
he' s had nothing else on his mind since sunday .
i know for sure she' il be late .
watch him .
in a minute , he' il pick up that book and pretend he' s not worried and he' s reading .
there you are , what did i tell you ?
he' s no more reading than i am .
he' s all ears , listening for her footsteps .
you know what ?
i ain' t had a single visitor since i' ve been in here .
i told ' em all i' m on silence , not allowed to talk .
oi , harry , your old woman' s here .
mrs clamacraft ?
don' t go all the way round .
come through here .
i' m not supposed to .
course you can .
come on .
here she is , harry .
hello , love .
harry , i' m sorry i' m late .
that' s alright .
now you' ve come .
she' s 20 minutes late and now she wastes another 20 telling him why .
i left home in time , but everything went wrong at the station .
you look worried .
i was only worried in case something had happened to you .
here' s your new laid eggs .
here' s your marmalade .
bleeding great chunks of peel in it .
no wonder he' s ill .
did that chap come about the smell in the garden ?
he thinks it' s trouble with the main drain .
now he' s worried about the bleeding drains .
how were your last x rays ?
i think they' re improving .
ask him to look at that loose gutter .
it might fall on you or the kids .
kill the bleeding lot of ' em .
i will .
how was your sputum test ?
now there' s a morale raiser !
they' re waiting for the results .
are you managing alright ?
i mean , about money ?
yes , everything' s going fine .
you' re sure ?
yes , certain .
they' re trying to get through to one another .
know what i mean ?
it ain' t easy with their sort of mentality .
here , see this ?
carla , her name is .
hear how her skirt rustles ?
there' s something about that rustling .
i think i' il get on my bed , just in case .
don' t let me disturb you .
you can take that later .
i know what it must be like , seeing each other only once a week .
she seems quite nice .
yeah , she' s very nice .
i' il just get you ready for your injection , mr elkins .
thank you , nurse .
would you like a banana ?
thanks .
ta .
did my mother come round ?
what ? !
yes .
was everything alright ?
she was put out because i hadn' t made the kids a cooked dinner .
she' s mad about sunday dinners .
young phil' s missing you ever so .
is he ?
he woke up early this morning .
i could hear him talking away to himself in his cot .
he kept scolding you for not coming home .
ah , bless him !
i seem to have only just got here .
don' t panic .
dirty beast !
the sister will give you your injection after tea .
tell her to send the blonde who' s a good dart thrower .
you won' t forget to write ?
as soon as they' ve gone to school .
give my love to phil and shirley .
i will .
bye , love .
eat your eggs .
yeah , i will .
don' t worry , i' il be alright in a minute .
don' t worry , i' il look after him .
he hates me going .
i' il soon cheer him up .
thank you .
you get dependent on ' em coming , see .
and it don' t do to get dependent on nobody in this life .
they bring fruit and flowers and say how well you look , and after five minutes , they' re dying for the bell so they can get away .
i know , i' ve watched ' em .
they' re no sooner out of the door than they say to each other ,
gawd , did you see old ned ?
didn' t he look rough ?
keep them insurance policies dusted .
don' t throw that black hat away .
i' ve heard ' em .
mr elkins .
hello , nurse .
you should be in bed .
i couldn' t sleep , so i come down and made a cup of tea .
you' re not supposed to .
i have been doing things all my life i' m not supposed to .
you know what ?
i had an ' orrible nightmare .
you must have had too much supper .
no , serious .
i dreamt that the hydrogen bomb had fallen , and i didn' t get killed .
but i got some of that dust on my shoulder , see ?
i rushes in this house , shuts the door , and who' s standing there ?
little malcolm .
who ?
oh , yeah .
it' s this kid i used to know .
and then i realised that this ... this dust on me , this poison i' ve picked up , ... .. will kill him .
and i was taking it to him .
i was taking death to him .
but what could i do ?
i had to save my bleeding self , didn' t i ?
made me feel rough , though .
it would make some sense to a psychiatrist .
you know what ?
i wish just for once
i could get myself to do something good in my dreams .
it wouldn' t cost me anything .
i' d get a great deal of satisfaction out of it .
they' ve got you when you' re awake and when you' re asleep . you' il be leaving here next month ?
yeah .
i' il be glad to get back to london .
it won' t be the same without you around here .
i ain' t gone yet .
would you like me to give you something to make you sleep ?
now , there' s a good idea .
alright , then , come with me .
marvellous what you can get on the national health .
bye , mr elkins .
bye , mrs clamacraft .
bye bye , love .
you know something ?
visiting days ain' t doing you any good .
how do you mean ?
takes you a week to get over one .
if you' re not careful , you' il be leaving here in your wooden suit .
but that' s all i live for , to see her and talk to her .
you' ve got to live for yourself , not for others .
you' d do without her if she got run over .
don' t talk like that , alfie .
no .
all i' m saying is , it don' t do to get attached to nobody like that in this life .
what your sort don' t understand ...
what ?
is ...
is the bond between husband and wife .
what i do understand is human bleeding nature .
how do you know your missus ain' t got a geezer outside ?
you say another word about my wife , i' il knock your bloody ... !
harry .
don' t get aeriated .
harry , sit quiet .
here , have a fag .
the doc said not to smoke more than five a day .
take no notice of the doc .
you' ve got to get yourself better .
no , all i meant was , with a bird , you can never tell where it' s been nor what it' s done .
say " she .
you' re talking about my wife .
she or it , they' re all birds .
what you' ve got to do is start living for yourself .
like i do .
they won' t keep me here long .
no , but , alfie , i miss the kids .
especially the youngest .
here , just listen to me .
just listen to me for a minute .
supposing tonight , you was to snuff it .
know what i mean ?
you' re a right ' un .
just supposing .
have a giggle .
that' s all life is .
say your old woman picks up with a bloke and brings him home .
not lily !
she wouldn' t .
why not ?
she ain' t bad .
she' s got a fair little figure .
not my type , but still .
she brings this bloke home and introduces him to the kids as uncle bill .
your kids' d get a kick out of him .
not young phil .
he' d be the first if uncle bill brought some toys .
you wouldn' t buy phil with toys !
then your missus tells the neighbours the kids need a dad .
she' d blame it on the kids .
what are you getting at ?
i only want you to see the truth and start getting better .
for a month or two after you' re gone , your wife and kids might take flowers to the cemetery , but once she' s married again and the kids start calling uncle bill " dad " , your little grave will become just a mass of weeds .
if you walked into your home six months later , your kids' d ask uncle bill , " dad , who is it ?
i' il knock your bloody head in !
you' re driving me up the wall !
all i want is for you to see life , see what it is and what it does to you .
i never wanted to hurt you , harry .
i never want to hurt anybody .
no , i suppose not .
but you do , alfie .
you do .
want a game of draughts ?
yeah , alright .
come on .
oi !
how are you ?
alright .
look at you .
i feel alright .
i' ve got a gaff lined up for you .
i' m not used to all this noise .
i' ve had six months of peace and quiet and fresh air .
i' d be scared to take a car out now .
i' ve got just the job for you , all the fresh air you want .
street photography .
i do it myself .
up at tower hill .
tons of tourists .
chat the birds up easy .
they' re asking for it .
nothing to it .
hold it , lady . little to the left .
three for 12 and a tanner .
i think these photographers are a damn nuisance .
i' m sure he' s a nice gentleman .
you can have it on your own .
you got film in that camera ?
are you loaded ?
yeah .
good .
good morning to you .
nice to see you , madam .
come on , lady , give us a great big smile .
here you are , sir .
not today .
they won' t bite .
i don' t want my photograph taken .
what about the young lady ?
nor does she .
how would you know that , sir ?
what about it ?
one on your jack ... ?
on your own ?
alright , i think i will .
vacationing ?
no .
immigrant ?
in a way .
married ?
sometimes .
now ?
no , not now .
how do you want me ?
well , i' ve got two positions , straight up or sideways , depending on your nationality .
i' il have you against the ships .
alright .
i' ve always been partial to the navy .
you look a real treat there , you do .
ruby , we' ve no time to waste here .
it won' t take a tick .
we' ve got a fast film in today .
allow me , madam .
he' s getting a bit choked up .
well , don' t let it worry you .
it doesn' t worry me .
it doesn' t seem to worry you , either .
i never let any man worry me .
i see what you mean .
now , that' s lovely .
can you hold it ?
i' il do my best , young man .
put a jerk in it !
i' il put a jerk in you .
hold it !
lovely .
that' s a real beauty .
now the close up .
lick your lips .
strewth !
now , watch the dickie bird .
now , what' s your address ?
and your telephone number .
that' s three of each .
it' il be 15 shillings , sir .
haven' t you got any change ?
no , i haven' t !
i' il have to look for some .
keep the bloody change !
hello .
how about a little souvenir ?
you can have an enlargement for four and six , sir .
i' ve got just the job for you , " nat says .
plenty of fresh air .
know what ?
i got the flu twice in six weeks .
so i went back to the hire car lark .
with the rolls there .
oh , yeah .
it' s very nice of you to come , alfie .
wasn' t it , love ?
yes , it was .
if i' d known you were gonna be here , i wouldn' t have come .
i didn' t mean that .
course not .
she looks real tired .
don' t you think so , alfie ?
i' m alright .
harry , you think about yourself , or you' il never get out of here .
yeah .
alfie , do you think you could give her a lift home in your car ?
harry !
please !
no !
it' s a long way for her by train .
yeah , i' il take her back .
it' s a pleasure .
he' il take you back .
she didn' t want to come and i didn' t want to take her .
we both agreed to please harry .
looks real ribby , though , don' t she ?
to brighten her up , i' m taking her a roundabout way .
show her a bit of the scenery .
well , you can only try , can' t you ?
how would you like a nice cup of tea , girl ?
i don' t want to be any trouble .
that' s alright .
one thing about driving a rolls , they' re pleased to see you anywhere .
know what ?
when she smiles that little smile of hers ,
i' m quite touched by it .
yeah .
now i look at her , she ain' t so ugly after all .
it must be hard on you , girl , old harry being away so long . still , i' il say this for him , he could hardly wait for those visiting days to come round .
don' t worry about him , lily .
he' il be home soon .
course he will .
cheer up .
well , what harm can it do ?
old harry will never know .
and , even if he did , he shouldn' t begrudge me .
nor her , come to that .
and it' il round off the tea nicely .
i don' t know what you must think of me .
i bet you ain' t been with many blokes besides harry .
i haven' t been with anyone .
where you going , love ?
london .
that' s a big place for a little girl .
come on , hop in .
hello , frank .
what do you want to eat ?
i' m not hungry .
just a cup of tea , please .
you must eat something .
no , thank you .
just tea with sugar .
wotcher , alfie .
how you doing ?
you wanna watch your loading ropes frank , they look a bit dodgy .
ta .
what' s the fancy dress for ?
got a rolls outside , ain' t i ?
you' re almost a stranger .
why didn' t you turn up ?
sorry , darling , i couldn' t make it .
a small tea and a slice of buttered toast , please .
you won' t get far on cups of tea .
i' il be alright .
who' s the mystery ?
that one , frank brought in .
watch it , alfie , that' s frank' s bird .
it' s not my type , anyway .
i' il just go and check those ropes , see they' re alright .
you ok ?
bit dead in here , though , isn' t it ?
i think i' il have a tune .
they ain' t half got some old ones , ain' t they ?
yes .
did you come in with frank ?
yes .
why ?
he' s a good bloke , frank .
a good mate .
yes , he seems nice .
yeah .
he' d share his last cigarette with you .
very good hearted is frank .
you know what ?
he' il even share his birds with his mates .
one bloke told me , he' il even lend you his wife .
like the eskimos do .
i wouldn' t fancy that .
well , i mean , she' s so bad tempered .
i didn' t think he was married .
yes , he' s got at least one wife .
being a long distance lorry driver , he' s away from home most nights .
funny , some blokes , aren' t they ?
i wouldn' t like sharing a girl , would you ?
no !
no .
where are you making for ?
well , london .
any particular place ?
not really .
i' d like to get a room and a job if i could .
here , i might be able to help you .
i know the personnel officer of a big toffee factory .
a lovely little number .
could i see you in london ?
i could take you down there .
i' ve got a rolls royce out there .
a radio , heater , the lot .
i should have to tell frank , first .
you daren' t risk that . he' il knock your block off .
mine , too .
see that door there ?
well , 50 yards down the road there' s a telephone kiosk .
you wait for me there .
i don' t like doing that .
don' t be frightened of me .
i ain' t a wolf , you know .
go on , before he comes back .
you don' t want sharing , do you ?
no .
of course you don' t .
go on , away you go .
would you tell the driver i came in with that i' ve had to go ?
i' il tell him .
how much i owe you , flo ?
one and a penny .
you ain' t going yet ?
i' m in a hurry all of a sudden .
what about your toast ?
give it to frank .
he could do with a slice .
see you .
see you , alfie .
did you see the way he lapped it up ?
can' t see what they all see in him .
frank' il go raving mad .
good .
sit back and enjoy yourself , girl .
do your folks at home know where you' re going ?
i haven' t got any .
there must be somebody ?
i want to make a new start in london .
i reckon you' ve landed on your feet . you' il have a great life with me .
it ain' t come up too bad , has it ?
all it needed was a good wash and a bit of care and attention .
it' s quite dainty .
you know what i mean ?
here , i no sooner take a pair of socks off than it washes ' em .
and it can cook , too .
a bit limited on the menu .
it goes in for lancashire hotpot and steak and kidney pie .
they blow you out a bit , but it does do a marvellous egg custard .
i ain' t never tasted nothing like it .
it' s pretty fair on the other , an ' all .
a bit on the shy side , but i find that makes quite a change these days .
oi .
turn it down a bit , annie .
it' s in love , see .
now , when it listens to that stuff ,
it daydreams that the bloke who threw it over will one day want it back .
what a bleeding hope .
just watch how it works .
scrub , scrub , scrub .
it takes some birds like that .
not all of ' em .
can i get you a cup of tea , alfie ?
take it easy !
you always want to be doing something .
here , i had a bird once , a big fat thing it was , got crossed in love or something .
the bigger they are , the harder they fall .
she used to sit in front of the fire , smoking cigarettes and drinking tea till her shins were burnt red raw .
give us a cup of tea , bracken shins , " i said to it once .
what ? " it said , " you paralysed ?
i soon got rid of it .
are you visiting your friend at the sanatorium ?
old harry ?
i thought i would .
you fancy a ride in the car , girl ?
i' ve some washing to do .
you' re always bleeding washing .
take a rest .
i feel better if i' m doing something .
well , if it makes you feel better , i' m not going to stop you .
punishes itself , you see .
that way life can' t get at it the same .
what time will you be back ?
you shouldn' t ask me that .
when i go out , i don' t know what day i' il be back , let alone what time .
i' m what is called a free agent .
sorry , alfie .
i just thought i' d have your meal ready .
make a meal that' s always ready .
hash or stew or something .
i thought i' d do something special .
get those boots for me , girl .
see , even she' s started asking me when i' il be back .
know what ?
that little remark could be the writing on the wall .
annie ?
when will you start using those gloves i bought you ? you' il ruin your hands with all that scrubbing .
they don' t matter .
they may not matter to you , but they matter to me .
nothing puts me off more than a woman getting hold of me with horny mitts .
you' ve got pretty little fingers .
they' re like a child' s .
look after ' em for me .
sometimes , it gets a dead ghostified look come over its little face , as though it were all sick inside with love , and its poor mind was stumbling about looking for a corner to rest in .
take the other night ...
after what we' d just been through , it made me really mad .
there' s a time and a place for everything .
even your thoughts have a proper place .
sorry , alfie .
forget him , girl .
i' m here and in the flesh .
blimey !
she looked dead guilty .
know what ?
i was sorry i spoke .
alfie " , i says to myself , " she' s as human as you are .
well , i' il be off now , girl .
like to give me a brush down ?
shall i say you' il be back about seven ?
say what you like .
whether i' il be here or not is another matter .
you have something ready .
if i' m here i' il eat it .
you know what , annie ?
you' re a nice looking girl , only you want to brighten yourself up .
don' t mope about depressed .
think of others .
so long .
take care of yourself , alfie .
i didn' t like leaving it there on a sunday , scrubbing away , but what could i do ?
you know what i mean ?
i couldn' t take it with me .
going up in the world , ain' t i ?
do you know what the rents are here ?
15 quid a week !
that' s including central heating , of course .
you' il never guess who i' m calling on . well , i wouldn' t have believed it myself three months ago .
i' m here , girl .
that' s life , isn' t it ?
you can never tell what' s round the corner .
down one minute , up the next
you drop a tanner , look around , and what do you find ?
ruby !
hello , baby !
hold it !
gotcha !
she' s in lovely condition .
what are you so impatient about ?
what do you think ?
don' t kiss my ear .
you know what it does to me !
what about it ?
let' s at least have a drink first .
whisky ?
you haven' t got a beer , have you ?
yes , i' ve probably got a beer on the ice .
she gets all this lot off income tax .
business expenses , see ?
she owns three hairdressers ' .
the thing i like about ruby , she' s a mature woman .
you can feel a lifetime of experience in her fingers .
know what i mean ?
i find i' m going in more for that sort of woman now .
here , don' t you dig your nails in like you did last thursday .
i' ve got scratches down my back .
i may do more than that today .
great long weals , they are .
she dug her nails right in .
she' s had two husbands .
both dead .
and i' ve a good idea what they died of .
she don' t keep asking do you love her like young birds do .
she don' t never mention love .
she knows what she wants and she' s gonna get it .
if there' s any going .
cheers .
cheers .
alfie , don' t you ever think about bringing your girlfriends flowers or candy ?
i often think about it , but i never do it .
not unless they' re in hospital .
don' t put your wet glass on my polished table !
you' re getting bleeding fussy .
i am not getting bleeding fussy .
you are .
i am not fussy !
hello !
she' s in beautiful condition .
you' re a little sexpot , ain' t you ?
am i ?
yeah .
you' re a little lust box , ain' t you ?
my little lust box !
i might settle down with her .
with a wife like ruby , you wouldn' t want nothing on the side .
bedroom !
here , come and have a look at this a minute .
great , isn' t it ?
have you caught the ceiling ?
look at the size of that bath !
king size .
a bit of a tight squeeze with two of us in it .
you can have a lot of fun splashing about and whatnot .
there have been times when i' ve felt lucky to get out of that bath alive .
hello , lads .
hello , alfie .
what you having ?
brown ale .
have you got the car outside ?
i don' t think i' il go up the club .
i' ve got this northern bird , annie , staying at my gaff .
can' t half cook .
cook ? !
what' s cooking got to do with it ?
she don' t like it if he don' t come home for his meals .
eh , alfie ?
no .
she does some handsome nosh ups .
steak and kidney pie , hotpot .
i love her cooking , i do .
i thought you was looking a bit blown out .
eh , vi ?
what do you mean , blown out ?
it' s just the appearance , alfie .
what appearance ? well , you look all puffed up .
blown out .
sort of ... poncified .
poncified ?
i' ve never felt fitter in all my life .
he wasn' t saying you wasn' t fit .
no .
you just look different , that' s all .
don' t he , vi ?
what' s bleeding different ?
that bird annie' s putting the block on you , mate , and you can' t see it .
what do you say , perce ?
looks that way .
she' s only looking after me .
in 12 months , you won' t recognise yourself .
you' il be stuffed to the ears with hotpot .
how you going , mate ?
i thought it was you .
remember that day you came in the busy bee ?
what day was that ?
couple of weeks back .
you was in a chauffeur' s uniform .
oh , yeah .
what about it ?
did you slope off with a little girl from sheffield called annie when my back was turned ?
who , me ?
no , i don' t know what you' re talking about .
you' re a bloody liar !
watch the suit .
it' s just back from the cleaner' s .
is that you , alfie ?
yeah , it' s me .
i' m late , ain' t i ?
start rucking me !
what happened ?
you' ve got an awful black eye .
blimey !
he' s injured me for life !
where' s that steak you bought ?
i' ve made you steak and kidney pie .
i' m fed up with hotpots and steak and kidney pies !
why can' t we have something out of a can for a change ?
corned beef or spam .
handsome grub , that was .
you said you liked my steak and kidney pies .
if i get that lot on top of a skinful of beer , i can hardly draw my breath !
i' il get an ' orrible feeling of being full up , blown out , poncified .
you said you loved that feeling of being full .
what i loved once and what i love now are two different things .
where' s my button down shirt ?
your blue one ?
in the drawer .
no , the pink one .
i washed it . it' il soon be dry .
why did you wash it ?
i only wore it for a few hours .
i thought it' d feel fresher for you .
i do believe you only wash to fill in your bleeding time !
why should i ?
to get him out of your mind !
get who out of my mind ?
that bleeding tony you write about in your little diary !
you can' t get outta your mind or something !
alfie , have you been in my bag and read my diary ?
why shouldn' t i ?
you shouldn' t because them' s my secret thoughts .
you ain' t entitled to secret thoughts living with me !
everyone' s entitled to them .
then you shouldn' t write them down and let me see ' em !
i only wrote them to get them out of me .
i' il show you what i think of you , your secret thoughts and your bleeding steak and kidney pie !
and don' t take nothing that don' t belong to you , either !
don' t let your custard spoil .
it' s in the oven .
annie ?
annie ?
come back !
i didn' t mean it !
come in .
you' re a bit early , girl .
i didn' t want to be late .
is he coming ?
yeah , about two o' clock , he said .
here , give us your bag .
blimey !
your hands ain' t half cold .
you ain' t worrying , are you ?
a bit .
yeah , you' re all dark under the eyes .
i couldn' t sleep last night .
well ...
and you can get ready for him when you want to .
thanks .
i' ve let myself in for something this time alright .
it was that day i took her up the river , see .
round about three months ago , it was .
that was something i thought i got for nothing .
but it don' t never work out that way , does it ?
so , i agrees to help her and lay it all on . well , it was the least i could do , knowing old harry , an ' all .
see what i mean ?
come in , mate .
well , here we are .
what do you mean , here we are ?
i mean you' ve come to the right place .
and this is the young lady i talked to you about on the phone .
pleased to meet you .
got your gear with you ?
don' t ask questions .
sorry .
this is the room where you can examine this young lady .
and why should i examine this young lady ?
well , you got to , ain' t you , before you do it ?
before i do what ?
do what you' ve come to do .
quiet , alfie .
there must be some mistake .
you are the gentleman i talked to last thursday night ?
alfie , please , be quiet .
don' t worry , my dear .
now , i must have a serious talk with you both .
are you two married ?
us two married ? !
blimey !
do we look it ?
no .
i mean , she' s a married woman , but i' m a single man .
is there any chance of you getting married in the near future ?
i very much doubt that .
what do you say , lily ?
but you are the putative father ?
the what ?
me ? !
i' m nothing .
i' m just obliging a friend .
well , that' s unusual .
it' s very unusual .
you are the man who ... is going to help me ?
her old man' s in a sanatorium , see ?
and she' s had a moral lapse .
see what i mean ?
i' m not quite sure that i do .
it' il never happen again .
she needs helping because her marriage would look very dodgy if her husband came out at this stage of the game .
got me ?
she' s got three other kids as well .
and where do you fit into all this ?
well , she had no place to go , see ?
well , that' s most altruistic .
i hope you both appreciate the seriousness of this case .
to terminate a pregnancy after 28 days is a criminal offence punishable in a court of law with seven years ' jail .
do you understand this , you two ?
yeah .
not only that , but it' s a crime against the unborn child .
it' s a course never to be embarked upon lightly .
you must consider the circumstances thoroughly before you go through with your decision .
since afterwards it will be too late to change your mind .
have you given the matter your fullest consideration ?
what do you say , lily ?
i' ve no way out .
then you' ve decided to go through with it ?
yes , i must .
then i might be able to help you .
thank you .
yes .
have you got the money ?
yeah , the money .
the young lady' s got it .
that' il be 30 .
25 .
that' s the figure we discussed .
very well , then , 25 .
right .
very well .
right , young lady , would you care to follow me ?
i' il need some boiling water .
the kettle' s on the stove in there .
good .
i hate anything like this .
my understanding of women only goes as far as the pleasure .
when it comes to the pain , i' m like every other bloke .
i don' t wanna know .
have you done ? !
almost everything i can do .
can she go home now , then ?
lord , no !
it' s only been induced .
it hasn' t happened yet .
that comes later .
if her temperature rises rapidly , give her two of these .
i' il leave you six .
how will i know ? well , if she starts to sweat , give her two .
here , mate .
shouldn' t you see the job through , considering how much you' ve been paid ?
two if she sweats .
how you feeling , girl ?
he gave me these tablets to give to you .
take two if your temperature goes up .
you do look old , girl .
he got his money easy .
not so loud .
my landlady' il hear !
i can' t help it !
this pain !
lily !
this pain !
i can' t help .. !
i' m sorry , lily .
i' m sorry .
i had to do it .
if my landlady heard , she' d have the ambulance here !
doctors , police , the lot !
all this would have been for nothing !
see what i mean ?
that' s why i had to do it .
is there something i can get you , lily ?
would you like a cup of tea ?
no .
you go .
i' m better on my own .
there' s nothing you can do .
you' il be alright , will you ?
you' re sure you' il be alright ?
i know it don' t look nice , going off and leaving her .
but what do look nice when you get close up to it ?
come on , malcolm !
you naughty boy !
you' re keeping everyone waiting .
suzanne elizabeth , i baptise thee in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost .
amen .
and now we join together in the family prayer of christians .
our father , which art in heaven ,
hallowed be thy name .
thy kingdom come , thy will be done , on earth as it is in heaven ...
who' s daddy' s best boy , eh ?
who' s daddy' s best boy ?
who' s the best boy in the world ?
lily ?
is it all over ?
yes .
i' il be ready to go in a minute .
there' s no hurry , girl .
no hurry .
don' t .
don' t go in there .
i could have dropped on the spot with the shock .
all i was expecting to see was ...
come to think of it , i don' t rightly know what i was expecting to see .
certainly not this perfectly formed being .
i half expected it to cry out .
it didn' t , of course .
it couldn' t have done .
it could never have had any life in it .
not a proper life of its own .
no , i suppose not .
still ... .. it must have had some life , of course .
and ... as it lay there so quiet and so still ... .. it quite touched me .
and i started praying or something .
saying things like , " god help me ! " and things like that .
and then i starts to cry .
straight up .
the tears were running down my face .
all salty .
like i was a kid myself .
crying for him , you mean , alf ?
no , not for him .
he was past it .
for my bleeding self !
you know , it don' t half bring it home to you what you are when you see a helpless little thing like that lying in your own hands .
he' d have been quite perfect .
and i thought to myself ,
you know what , alfie ?
you know what you done ?
you murdered him .
well , there' s nothing you can do about it now , alf .
will you lend me 25 quid , nat ?
don' t be bloody funny !
that' s all i' ve got in the world .
take this watch as security .
if i haven' t paid you back in two weeks , you can sell it .
i don' t want no security .
i' il give you the money .
thanks very much , nat .
well , that' s that .
you all ready ?
come on , i' il run you home .
i' d sooner go on my own .
you say that again , you will go home on your own .
i want to .
ok by me .
there' s a bus to waterloo or a green line all the way .
here .
this is for little phil .
who ?
phil , your youngest .
the one who writes all them squiggly letters .
what is it ?
you wanna see it ?
i bought it a long , long time ago .
for a little kid i used to know .
catch .
tell him it' s from his uncle alfie .
come on , mate .
i' il take you home .
i' m definitely gonna settle down with this ruby .
i' m fed up with being on the move .
you know , i find i' m not stalking these young birds any more .
ruby !
where are you , girl ?
alfie ?
i thought i' d give you a surprise .
i' il be right out !
make yourself a drink .
alright .
i was sleeping .
i' ve got a headache .
i took a pill .
oh , i' m sorry .
you said you were on a job today .
it fell through .
want a drink ?
no thanks .
you better go , darling .
i' ve got a splitting headache .
alright .
you better have these now i' ve brought ' em .
alfie , what a thing for you to do .
i never thought i' d live to see the day .
i like surprising a woman .
you did that .
look at the wrapper .
they' re not off a barrow .
i can see that .
they' re lovely .
really lovely .
thank you .
i' il go .
you take an aspirin , girl .
i will .
that' s new .
new ?
what ?
that radio .
where did you get that ?
i picked it up cheap .
will you ring me tomorrow ?
i' il be alright then .
i' il come around lunch time .
we might have a session .
yeah , why not ?
right .
see you .
alfie ?
yeah ?
i' m sorry about the headache .
i' il make it up to you .
sure .
what' s that ?
what ?
that ?
it' s a guitar .
you doing it with groups now ?
don' t be so disgusting !
and the radio .
you' ve got a bloke in there , ain' t you ?
it' s none of your business !
you pick him up cheap , too ?
there is no one in there !
i honestly thought you had a headache .
what a mug i' ve grown into !
get out of here !
i have a splitting headache !
why him ?
better than me ?
what' s he got that i haven' t ?
apart from long hair ?
well ?
come on , let' s have it .
what' s he bleeding got ?
he' s younger than you are .
you got it ?
he' s younger than you are .
that' s what she said .
anybody would think i was doddering about on crutches .
trouble is , i still keep thinking about her .
i can' t get her out of my mind .
who' d have thought a ruddy great lust box like her would have found her way into anybody' s feelings ?
she might have looked a hard case , but underneath she was quite mumsy .
and she was in beautiful condition .
do you know , i' m beginning to think she was beautiful .
after all , it ain' t through the eyes that you feel beauty , it' s how the heart hungers for something that makes it beautiful .
oi !
siddie .
alfie .
hello .
i ain' t seen you in ages .
you didn' t turn up .
look , i can explain that .
i ain' t half missed you .
i like that gear .
where you going ?
i' ve got the car round the corner .
what about it ?
i can' t , i' m gonna meet my husband .
it' s nice material .
still , you always was a snappy dresser .
what about sunday , then ?
no , i' m not sure .
come on .
same time , same place ?
we' il see .
i' il wait for you for five minutes .
don' t forget your napkin .
i' m like the boy scouts , i am , always prepared .
see you , then ?
maybe .
you know what ?
when i look back on my little life and the birds i' ve known , and think of all the things they' ve done for me and the little i' ve done for them , you' d think i' d had the best of it all along the line .
but what have i got out of it ?
i' ve got a bob or two , some decent clothes , a car .
i' ve got my health back and i ain' t attached .
but i ain' t got my peace of mind .
and if you ain' t got that , you ain' t got nothing .
i don' t know , it seems to me that if they ain' t got you one way , they' ve got you another .
so what' s the answer ?
that' s what i keep asking myself .
what' s it all about ?
know what i mean ?
come on , boy .
