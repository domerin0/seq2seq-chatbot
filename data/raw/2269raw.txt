they keep comin ' .
like cockroaches .
they' re eatin ' all the food .
they' re breathin ' all the air .

are we gonna let ' em move in and take it all away from us , or else ?
you' re damn right no .
what are we gonna do , huh , buddy boys ?
i' il tell you what we' re gonna do .
we' re gonna speed fast .
we' re gonna move like lightnin ' ... and we' re gonna clean them sharks up once and for all ... so they ain' t never gonna set foot on our turf again .
and we' re gonna do it in one all out fight .

the sharks want a piece of this world too .
they' re real down boys .
they might ask for blades , zip guns .
zip guns ?
well , gee .

and we gotta be prepared .
now , what' s your mood , jets ?

i say this turf is small ... but it' s all we got , huh ?
i want to hold it like we always held it with skin .
but if they say blades , i say blades .
lf they say guns , i say guns .
i say i want the jets to be the number one ... to sail , to hold the sky !
then rev us off !
okay , cats , we rumble .
protocality calls for a war council between us and the sharks ... to set the whole thing up .
i will personally give the bad news to bernardo .
you gotta take a lieutenant with you .

he don' t belong no more .
now , cut it , action .

so where is he ?
how come he takes a lousy , stinkin ' job ?
youth board corrupted him .

he saved my ever lovin ' neck .
sure , he' il do it again too .
he always came through for us , and he always will .

it' s when i don' t look that it happens .
i think i will tell mama and papa ... about you and nardo in the balcony of the movies .

next year .
i hate that dress !
then don' t wear it .

and suddenly i found
how wonderful a sound can be
say it loud and there' s music playing
say it soft
and it' s almost like praying
i' il never stop saying
say it loud and there' s music playing

they use maria for an excuse to start world war ill .
it is more than that .
more than what ?
she was only dancing .
with an american who is really a polack .
says the spic .
you are not so cute .
that tony is .
and he works .
a delivery boy .
and what are you ?
an assistant .
and chino makes half of what the polack makes .
the polack is an american .

your mother' s a pole .
your father' s a swede .
but you were born here .
that' s all that you need .
you are an american .
but us ?
foreigners !
lice .
cockroaches .
but it' s true .
when i think about how i thought it would be for us here .
we came like children , believing , trusting .
with our hearts open .

you came with your mouth open .
you did , spic , and you' il go back in handcuffs .
i' m going back in a cadillac .
air conditioned .
built in bar .
telephone .
television .
compatible color .
lf you had all that here , why would you want to go back to puerto rico ?

now she' s queer for uncle sam .
oh , no .
that' s not true .
puerto rico
my heart' s devotion
let it sink back

officer krupke he shouldn' t be here
this boy don' t need a couch he needs a useful career
society' s played him a terrible trick
and sociologically he' s sick i am sick
we are sick , we are sick we are sick , sick , sick
like we' re sociologically sick
ln my opinion , this child does not need to have his head shrunk at all .
juvenile delinquency is purely a social disease .
hey , i got a social disease !
take him to a social worker .
which way ?
that way .
dear kindly social worker
they tell me get a job
like be a soda jerker which means like be a slob
it' s not i' m antisocial i' m only anti work
gloryosky that' s why i' m a jerk
officer krupke you' ve done it again
this boy don' t need a job he needs a year in the pen
it ain' t just a question of misunderstood
deep down inside him he' s no good i' m no good
we' re no good , we' re no good we' re no earthly good
like the best of us is no damn good
the trouble is he' s lazy the trouble is he drinks
the trouble is he' s crazy the trouble is he stinks
the trouble is he' s growing the trouble is he' s grown
krupke , we got troubles of our own
gee , officer krupke we' re down on our knees
' cause no one wants a fella with a social disease
gee , officer krupke what are we to do
gee , officer krupke krup you

and it' s all that i need
right or wrong
and he needs me too
i love him
we' re one
there' s nothing to be done
not a thing i can do
but hold him
hold him forever
be with him now
tomorrow
and all
of my life
when love comes so strong
there is no right or wrong
your love is
your love
