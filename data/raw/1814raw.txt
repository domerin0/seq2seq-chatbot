i' ve lived in the theatre since i was a kid . what i don' t know about acting isn' t worth knowing . now , you may be 20 years old and just beginning , but i think you' re a genius . you' ve got magnetism , but no idea how to use it . you have to grab the audience by the throat and say : " now , you buggers , you pay attention to me !
and remember this , when you' re on the stage acting , theatre is the only reality .
everything else , the world outside , what civilians call the real world , is nothing but fantasy . and i bloody well won' t let you forget it .
the trouble is , darling , i' m an incurable romantic .
i believe in love ,
i believe in happiness ,
i believe in us .
no , you don' t . you' re just saying that .
there' s someone else , isn' t there ?
i love you , i do .
i do , i love you and i used to believe we' d live happily ever after .
didn' t you ? with every fiber of my being .
only now ... [ audience applauding ]
good morning , miss lambert . good morning , margery , is anyone with my lord and master ?
no .
darling , what are you doing here ?
i want an answer , michael . what' s the question ? what did i say to you before we went to sleep last night , hmm ?
uh , i give up . what did you say to me before we went to sleep last night ?
i said i was tired . it seems a perfectly natural thing to say before you go to sleep .
christ , michael , you can be an irritating little shit !
julia , julia , really , if your public could only hear your language .
i want them to hear .
i want every bloody one of them to hear .
i' m tired .
i am utterly exhausted .
i need a holiday . just admit it , michael . you' ve never understood what it means to carry a play , to sweat it out night after night .
i' m the only one who takes it seriously , michael , you know that . all you do is count the money and think it' s a bloody great lark .
take the play off . but we' il lose a fortune . our partner won' t like it . to hell with dolly !
i' m sorry , sweetheart . god , i didn' t mean to be so vile . it' s just i' m i' m near to breaking point .
everything' s so tedious .
i want something to happen . what ?
i wish i knew . please . please close the play at the end of the month .
yeah .
i really do have to think about it . we can' t have the theatre dark .
hmm ?
i' il try and see what i can do .
i promise . hmm ? please .
i promise . thank you .
you were very quiet
leaving the house this morning . well , i didn' t want to wake you . you were dead to the world . hmm .
i did my exercises and went for a run . exercises , running ... god , michael , you' re the vainest man in london . me , vain ? nonsense .
i just want to preserve my magnificent good looks for as long as possible .
oh , yes , speaking of good looks , did you notice that young man as you came in ? no . he' s an american . son of a friend of a friend of eddie gilbert' s .
i can' t see what that' s got to do with me . he admires you tremendously . oh , he sounds frightfully intelligent . what' s his name ? can' t remember . uh , unfortunately , he' s as poor as a church mouse .
i thought we might give him a spot of lunch . well , he' s awfully good mannered , for an american .
uh !
rubbish mail , margery . yes , mr. gosselyn . uh , i would like to introduce you to my wife ,
julia lambert .
julia , this is this is this is the young man i was telling you about . he wants to learn the business , so we' re starting him off with our accountant . it it' s an honor to meet you , miss lambert .
i wonder if we could persuade you to come and eat a chop with us .
michael will drive you back after lunch .
gee , that' s real kind of you . you two take the lift , i' il take the stairs .
last one down' s a sissy . miss lambert , could i could i ask you a favor ?
i can' t give you any more room , if that' s what you mean . no , no , no , it' s , uh ...
i wonder ... would you ... would you let me have a photograph ? of course . gee , that' s swell of you .
i' ve seen you in farewell , my love 3 times . you haven' t . have you really ? it' s such a silly play . oh , it' s not the play , it' s you . you' re just ... just great .
i' m glad you liked me .
liked you ?
i loved you .
i won .
what ? well done . come on , mr ... uh ...
all an actress like julia needs is a vehicle . it' s the actors the public go to see , not the play . that' s true in my case .
i' d see you in anything , miss lambert . but you know what i' d really like to find out ? how did you start ? how did you get to be where you are , owning a theatre , top of the tree ? clean living and hard work . cigarette ? we owe it all to a rude , foul mouthed brute called jimmie langton . we were in his repertory company in middlesbrough . he knew all there is to know about theatre and acting . that' s where i met michael . that' s how we began .
i was a rotten actor . yes , but you have presence . the audience always gasps when you come on . it' s his dazzling good looks , you see . gee , this is fascinating . fascinating . dreadfully jealous of him ? you' re very sweet , but i know perfectly well that all i can play are diplomats , lawyers and politicians .
i' m more interested in the business side . that' s yes , but you know as well as i do that we' d be nothing without jimmie .
i always lay a place for him at the table . just in case he turns up . he' s been dead for 15 years . yes , but you never know . he was a monster .
uh , how do you spell your first name ?
t o m .
hoy ! hoy ! hoy ! hoy ! hoy !
for god' s sake , don' t torture yourself like this , laura .
no one will ever know how much i loved him .
he was my earth , my moon , all the stars in the firmament .
farewell , my love .
bravo ! bravo !
no , there' s nothing left for me now but to tour canada and australia , god help me . nonsense , miss lambert . it' s not nonsense .
i' ve decided to retire and let myself go .
i' il have potatoes for lunch and potatoes for dinner .
beer . god , i love beer !
and treacle pudding and cherry tart and cream .
cream , cream , cream , cream , cream ... [ breathing deeply ]
as god is my judge ,
i' il never eat a lettuce leaf again .
oh , god , i bet i know who that is .
good afternoon , evie .
oh , mrs. de vries , what a surprise . uh , i hope this isn' t inconvenient but i have to see miss lambert on a business matter . she isn' t having one of her afternoon naps , is she ?
wait a minute .
guess who' s here . show her in . business , she says , but isn' t it funny how she always manages to time her visits when you' re lying stark bollock naked . enough of that , you dirty minded slut .
show her in .
mrs. de vries .
julia , darling . dolly , dear . hmm .
oh , i' m so sorry .
i always seem to call when you' re you' re otherwise engaged .
tea ? lovely . ignore me .
i' il i' il just sit here quiet as a lamb until you' re done .
so evie said something about business . hmm ?
what ? oh , yes . um , michael tells me you want to close the play . my husband' s a devious little runt .
oh , that' s unfair . he was perfectly right to consult me . we' re partners . the 3 of us . a perfect combination . my money , his know how , your genius .
i' m exhausted , dolly .
i feel twice my age which makes me 90 .
i' m bored . life has nothing in store for me . you mean that or are you acting ?
i never know when you' re acting .
i' m not acting .
i' m near to having a breakdown .
i feel as though my life' s come to an end . all right . all right . all done . oh , thank you , you' re a dear .
uh . are you really near a breakdown , julia ?
oh , i don' t know .
i don' t know .
i' m in such an odd state at the moment .
it' s as if ... it' s as if the curtain' s come down on act 1 , but i have no idea what happens in act 2 .
i i' m in a sort of limbo . waiting for something to happen . but what ?
what ? oh , please , dolly , be my friend .
oh . make michael take the play off .
i need a holiday .
i could visit visit my mother in jersey , and then visit you in france . oh .
i could swim in your pool . in the nuddy .
lovely flowers for someone .
oh , hello , a blooming florist' s shop .
who sent them ?
mrs. de vries ? very likely . or lord tamerley . here , don' t forget , you' ve got dinner with him after the show tonight . yes , i know . expect you' il have to turn on the waterworks for him again as per usual .
i wish you' d teach me to cry real tears . the times i' ve needed them .
oh , here' s a card .
from mr. thomas fennel , tavistock square . what a place to live . who the hell do you suppose he is , evie ? oh , some feller knocked all of a heap by your fatal beauty , i expect . probably cost a fortune . went without dinner for a week . oh , pull the other one .
beginners , please , miss lambert . mmm hmm . well , whoever mr. thomas fennel is ,
i think it' s all right having a young man send me flowers at my time of life .
i mean , it just shows you how do you know he' s a young man ? he' s probably over 80 .
go to hell .
i' m on my way i' m on my way
i' m busy ' cause i' m on my way [ people applauding ]
thank you . thank you .
julia lambert .
the champagne now , my lord ? thank you , antoine . and for you , madame lambert ?
i' d prefer beer but i mustn' t , so i' il make do with bubbly . thank you .
oh . it' s a portrait of clairon . she was a great actress , and i believe you have many of her gifts .
charles , you are sweet .
i thought you might like it .
it' s by way of being a parting present . you' re going away ? no . but i shan' t be seeing you anymore . oh , charles , not again .
no . this is becoming a ritual . why ? we have such a beautiful friendship , julia . it' s unique in my experience , but people talk .
they don' t understand . and even though we know the truth , if we go on seeing one another , there will be a terrible scandal . no , there won' t .
michael and i lead separate lives . that' s why we' re so happily married . more or less . jumped up little tart , that' s what she is .
never stops acting , on stage or off . she' s just one big pose . dashed pretty . shut up , rupert , don' t show your ignorance .
i know all about her . we were both born in the channel islands , jersey . her father was our doctor . a jersey doctor !
you can' t get more common than that .
it' s only common sense , darling .
i don' t want to lose you .
i i have few friends . real friends .
you' re the only person in my life with whom i can be entirely myself .
i' m terribly low at the moment .
i i need you .
let' s go on seeing each other . please . uh , please forgive us intruding like this , miss lambert .
my friend and i are such very great admirers . and i wonder ... do you remember me ?
florence coltraine , isn' t it ?
rupert and i want you to settle an argument .
i think i used to know your father in jersey .
he was a doctor , wasn' t he ? he used to come to our house quite often . actually , he was a vet . he used to go to your house to deliver the bitches . the house was full of them .
life is just a bowl of cherries don' t take it serious life' s too mysterious you work , you save you worry so but you can' t take your dough when you go
i' m sorry , i didn' t mean to frighten you . t o m .
you remember . did you like the the flowers ? oh , mr. thomas fennel , tavistock square .
yes , of course , thank you . well , uh , i couldn' t decide between a single rose and every flower in the store . is that why you' re here at this time of night ? to find out if i received the flowers ? no . you see , i don' t have a phone yet .
i don' t see why not . will you really ? how about next friday ?
138 tavistock square , 4 : 30 ?
all right .
i' il be there . gee , that' s swell . see you then . the sweet things in life to you were just loaned so how gonna you lose what you' ve never owned ?
life is just a bowl of cherries
oh ?
i saw you drive up .
i' m afraid i' m on the 3rd floor .
i hope you don' t mind . and if i do ?
we' re there . thank god for that .
the gas ring' s in the bathroom . oh . it isn' t the ritz , but it' s home . no , it' s it' s charming . it' s so london . it reminds me of my early days .
i have to put coins in the gas meter . oh , yes , so did i.
have some cake .
i bought it specially . oh .
i shouldn' t , but i will .
you know something ? you ought to be in movies . real actresses don' t make films .
but beautiful actresses do . hmm . well , i saw you in nobody' s perfect on broadway .
i was 14 at the time .
i wish you hadn' t told me that .
i stood outside the stage door and , uh , i got your autograph . you asked me my name .
i told you . you knew how to spell it then .
what' s so funny ?
you remind me of something . what is it ?
my husband . in a scene we had to play .
he didn' t know how to sit down .
jimmie made him do it over and over again .
uh , i can' t stay long .
i must have a nap before my performance . but you' ve only just arrived . and you you can' t go without , uh , without , well , seeing the view . it' s really great . if you just come over to the window ...
isn' t it terrific ?
i just love london . it' s so big , but it' s also kind of friendly . and all those people , each with their own lives .
i can' t explain it . when i first came to london , i stood in piccadilly circus
looking at the lights and the people and the taxis , and i said out loud : " one day i' m going to conquer you . " and you have . have i ?
i wonder
look at my hair .
uh , here . oh ? thank you .
and i thought you were such a shy young man .
when am i when am i gonna see you again ?
you want to see me again ?
what do you think ?
i' il ring you up one of these days . uh , my hat ... oh , uh ... good . well , uh , i have a phone now . and the number' s museum 4516 . so promise you' il call soon . on my honor .
i can see myself out .
for christ' s sake , julia , what do you think you' re doing ? you' re supposed to be playing a whore , not a schoolgirl with a crush on her gym mistress . you kissed him as if you were frightened of catching his cold . when you kiss , you should feel as if your bones are melting inside your body . tongues , darling , that' s what it' s about , tongues . now , i know you' re a virgin . don' t give me the waterworks , julia , i' m too old for that . you' re a virgin , so what you have to do is find a handsome young man ,
like your juvenile man , michael gosselyn . go back to your rooms , take your clothes off , lie on the bed , open your legs and ask him to give it to you hot , sweet and strong . if that doesn' t improve your acting , then nothing will . right , let' s do it again .
what' s so funny ?
i feel as though i' m a 2 year old .
that' s 88 years you' ve lost in a week .
tell us the secret , we' il bottle it and make a fortune .
hmm .
damn it all , miss lambert , you don' t look so bad .
you can go on playing 25 year olds ,
30 year olds for a good long time yet .
and then what ? whoo ! mothers , grandmothers and old maids .
bugger playwrights . can' t write for women . they' re all men , that' s the trouble .
yes ? good morning .
t o m . you promised to call me .
give a girl a chance .
when am i going to see you again ? as soon as i have a moment to spare . come to tea after the matinee .
oh , i' m not falling for that one again . how about dinner after the show then ?
if you insist .
i do .
on the silver screen he melts her foolish heart in every single scene although she' s quite aware that here and there are traces of the cad about the boy
lord knows she' s not a fool girl
she really shouldn' t care
lord knows she' s not a school girl in the flurry of her first affair
will it ever cloy this odd diversity of misery and joy i told them
look , there' s lord crumley over there . and i think that' s lady laweston . what have you been reading , debrett' s ?
debrett' s ? no , the tatler .
oh , you have to know who' s who to get on in this town . oh , you want to get on , do you ?
i want to get on you , julia . don' t be disgusting . but i want you .
i do .
you' re the loveliest girl that one
i want you .
your conversation' s frightfully limited , tom .
dance with me . what time is it ? oh , well , uh , i ...
i forgot to put on my watch .
have you pawned it ? no , no , i just , uh ,
i i dressed in rather a hurry tonight .
they' il never believe me they' il never believe me that from this great big world you' ve chosen
he treated you like a tart . which of course is what you are .
he was my earth , my moon ,
and all the stars in the firmament .
farewell , my love .
you were wonderful tonight , my darling .
bloody marvelous . you almost made me cry . only almost ?
i' il kill whoever set the photo . thanks , archie . and what' ve you done to your eyes ? hmm ? some new makeup ?
i' ve never seen them shine like that before . your call , mr. dexter . hmm .
sorry about the photo , it won' t happen again . hmm . your call , miss lambert . you' re forgiven .
what' s the matter with her ?
darling , julia .
you were quite wonderful tonight .
i' il say . absolutely first rate . thank you . yes , i believe i was firing on all cylinders . and i' m starving , absolutely ravenous .
evie , what have we got for supper tonight ? tripe and onions . oh , how divine .
i adore tripe and onions .
michael , michael , if you love me , if you' ve got any spark of tenderness in that hard heart of yours ,
let me have a bottle of beer . beer ? yes .
julia . just this once . oh , evie , that' s for you . uh , please ?
julia , i think it' s a damn shame .
what is ? well , that you' re taking the play off . the good news is ,
i' ve found an italian company who wants the theatre for 3 months , so i said they could have it . hmm . mmm .
i' m sure your mother' s as excited as i am at the thought of being with you . we' il have such fun at my place , julia . you could do anything you like . rest . anything .
i' ve changed my mind .
i don' t know why , but i' m beginning to enjoy myself again . oh , but
let' s run through the summer and then find something new for the autumn . but i' ve ...
i i' ve ...
i' ve told the italians . then un tell them . and i was so looking forward to france . stars will be stars .
i forgot . what ? hmm ...
oh , my god . a cartier . well spotted . when' s your birthday ?
november 20 . hmm . happy birthday . uh , but it' s not november 20 . don' t be so pedantic . open it .
oh , that' s the one thing i' ve wanted my whole life .
thank you .
uh , geez , it' s lousy
i can' t give you anything in return . give me that watch you pawned to buy me supper . have you redeemed it yet ? ah ! thanks .
it' il amuse me to wear it .
i love you , julia .
this is total insanity .
i' m old enough to be ...
god , i' m a fool ,
i' m such a bloody fool .
good morning , evie . where' s my wife ? in your study . my study ? mmm hmm . what' s she doing there ? exercising .
exercising ?
what are you doing ? swimming the channel , what do you think i' m doing ?
yeah , but why ?
miss phillips said my tummy needed tightening , so i' m tightening it .
oh .
oh , yes , i had a thought . we should take a country house for the summer . what do you think ?
i' il talk to you later .
so do you think a house for the summer' s a good idea ?
yes . golf , swimming , tennis . it' il be especially good for roger . he loves golf . then he' il have to decide what' s he gonna do with his life .
i think he should go to university . he doesn' t want to , and we shouldn' t insist . it' s his life . oh , yes , i had another idea . you remember that young chap i introduced you to ? which young chap ? that american . good looking fellow . remember ?
american , you must remember . vaguely . well , he' s frightfully good at his job . he' s a wizard with money .
lots of american ideas for avoiding tax .
what about him ? well , i thought we might invite him down for a couple of weeks to spend his holiday with us .
why would we want to do that ? he' il be company for roger . he' s only a bit older .
roger will like him , i' m sure of it . shall i ask him ? hmm . ah !
remind me to keep exercising .
so , will you come and stay ?
michael says the house is frightfully comfortable . probably not .
i' m going abroad for a couple of months .
what fun . well , you' il be busy , won' t you ?
looking for a new play , reading scripts .
so , what do you think ? he hasn' t done justice to your eyes .
as a matter of fact , there is a play that interests me . it' s about an older woman who has an affair with a younger man . oh , a farce . why do you say that ? well , because everyone laughs at the older woman . no , not in this play . it' s all serious .
the act 1 curtain' s good . it comes as a shock to her . what does ? that she' s fallen in love with the boy .
and it happens just when everything seemed to her so dull and unpromising , as if her life was over . she finds the affair exhilarating . and everyone keeps telling her she looks 10 years younger .
i trust she doesn' t confess to the boy that she loves him . that' s always fatal .
does it sound like something for me ? oh , don' t be ridiculous , julia .
no , your public would never stand for it . if such a woman asked me ,
i know what advice i' d give her . what ? break it off at once . it will only end in tears . but , charles , she can' t do that . why ever not ? because she' s fallen in love with him , that' s why . she' s helpless . hmm .
the character in the play .
dolly , old thing , how are you ?
i haven' t seen you for ages .
sit down and make yourself , uh , comfy . so , come to see that the old firm' s raking in the dividends for you ?
michael , i' il come straight to the point . you know i' m not one to gossip , but but i' m upset about julia .
i think you ought to know that people are beginning to talk . what the devil do you mean ? well , it' s absurd that at her age , she should make herself so conspicuous with a young boy . oh , you mean tom fennel ? don' t be such a fool , dolly .
i' m not a fool . when someone is as well known as julia and they' re always seen with the same man , naturally people talk . tom fennel is a very good type of american . he' s clean , honest and by way of being a gentleman . he' s boring , dull , common and a snob .
he' s just using julia . he' s a little gold digger .
can you look me in the eyes , dolly , and tell me you really think
julia' s having an affair with him ?
no . ah . the truth is , michael , i' ve hardly seen her . she never telephones anymore , and ... and ...
i understand , dolly , believe me .
she' s very fond of you , you know that , but she' s bound to have other friends .
i don' t think chaps should talk about their wives to others .
i think it' s frightfully bad form but let me explain something to you about julia . sex doesn' t mean a thing to her . it was different in the beginning . then she could be somewhat tiresome sometimes .
but after she had roger , she changed . having a baby seemed to settle her . all those instincts went into her acting , you see . gossip isn' t good for business , michael .
i mean , if julia had one flagrant affair after another , nobody would notice but but this boy , he' s half her age . the public has always looked up to you as such a devoted and loyal couple . and so we are , damn it . in our way . devoted , united , but not ... how shall i put it ? not possessive .
we' re a very modern couple .
hello , roger , my boy . hello , daddy . glad to be finished at eton ? no mummy ? no , it' s saturday . she' s got 2 shows .
3 and 4 pence , sir . she' il be down first thing in the morning . thank you so much . thank you , sir . here , let me give you a hand . she' s bringing a young chap down with her , your age more or less . a yank .
i think you' il like him .
i get no kick from champagne mere alcohol doesn' t thrill me at all so tell me why should it be true that i get a kick out of you [ sighing ] what' s the matter ? nothing . tell me . it' s ...
i i i just don' t ...
i' m worried sick , that' s all . what about ? tell me , tom . what ? it' s money , i owe money . oh . is that all ?
i thought it was something serious . well , it' s ok for you , julia , but i just can' t afford all the things we do . nightclubs , restaurants . sweetheart . how can you let a trifle like that upset you ? don' t worry about it .
i' il give you the money . no , i i couldn' t take any money from you . what nonsense . why grudge me the happiness it gives me to get you out of a hole ?
i get a kick out of you
i thought tonight we might play mahjong . do you play mahjong , tom ? no , i sorry , um , no can do . we' re going down to the pub to assess the local talent .
oh , i might come with you . the barmaid is an absolute stunner .
god , you' re all so vulgar . well , mummy , you have an early night . it' il do you good . you' re looking awfully fagged .
more wine ?

i told you . oh , no .
i just dried off , tom , i hate you .
i' m going to get you back .
you' re an uncivilized oaf .
and you' re running away .
come on , michael , you promised me a dance .
so i did , sorry .
i might be out of practice .
answer my question , julia .
what question ? would you ? would i what ? tour in the second mrs. tanqueray for 17 pounds a week . and it' s a 6 month tour , darling .
6 months . no , i can' t be away from home for 6 months . what would archie do without me ?
oh , he' il think of something .
mmm . they' re so bloody mean , these managements .
i said , " give me 18 pounds and i' il do it . " and he said , " 18 pounds ?
18 pounds ! " cheeky little sod .
what are you doing tonight ?
i don' t know . do you know that girl' s name ? which girl ? oh , that' s avice crichton .
you couldn' t have her for 80 pounds , never mind 18 pounds .
i thought that was witty . don' t you think that was witty ? hilarious . well , they' re not number one dates , darling . oh , not at all .
lowestoft , bournemouth and chesterfield and christ knows where else .
6 months ... mummy , we' re going to london to have supper and do the clubs , all right ?
no . no , really not , you' ve all had too much to drink . tom hasn' t . he' s driving , and one of the girls has a car .
yeah . yeah , we had a great time
good night , old man . good night , pal .
are you are you crazy , what do you think you' re you doing ?
i was about to ask you the same thing . go back to your room .
i' ve hardly seen you since you' ve been here . you' ve seen roger more than me . we haven' t been alone . what' s wrong with you ? you haven' t held me , you haven' t kissed me . shh .
avice crichton certainly looks like one .
i' m going back to london tomorrow . good .
i hope you remember to tip the servants or do you want me to give you the money , hmm ?
these are yours , take them back . don' t be such a bloody little fool . you think i like being a kept boy ? you think i like being humiliated like this , huh ?
i' m sorry , i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
i didn' t mean it . that makes it even worse .
i should never have let you give me these presents .
i should never have let you lend me that money . by the end of the month i' il pay you back .
i' ve apologized . don' t go to london tomorrow , please .
i love you , tom .
please .
i' m tired .
i want to go to bed now .
now , that' s the real thing , julia , or my name' s not jimmie langton . but i' ve got some notes . you' re still going over the top . you' ve got to learn restraint .
and for christ' s sake , stop crying , will you ? we all know you can turn your tears on and off like a tap , so turn them off , will you ?
well , bugger me , you really are crying this time , aren' t you ?
i can' t say i wasn' t moved , but you' ve got to learn to do it so that it seems real . seems to be real , that' s the art of acting . hold the mirror up to nature , ducky , otherwise you' il become a nervous wreck , take to drink and end up a piss artist playing gin sodden whores all over scotland on number 3 tours . technique , that' s what i want you to learn . technique .
i saw the light on . can i come in ? yes , of course . is something wrong ?

i needed to tell you . it had to happen sooner or later . it makes me feel so old .
age cannot wither her , nor custom stale her infinite variety " if i' d been cleopatra ,
i' d have put whoever said that to death .

i hate having to ask for more time . but ... don' t be such a bloody little idiot , tom .
it' s so humiliating , julia . geez , when you said you' d pay my tips for me , how do you think that made me feel ?
i said i' m sorry , i didn' t mean it .
i was jealous of you spending so much time with roger .
i was jealous .

i should never have accepted anything from you .
you' re everything in the world to me . you know that .
i love being with you .
i don' t want to lose you .
i have few friends . real friends .

oh , julia .
well , i' ve always said , you' re lucky you can cry without your eyelids swelling .
go to hell . well , you' re looking a lot happier ,
i' il say that for you .
i hope with good reason . if you' re thinking what i think you' re thinking , then stop thinking . all the same , evie , you know what i think ? no , what do you think ? what mugs men are . well , they can' t keep it in their trousers ,
yes , i am happier . everything will be all right now .
i can' t help feeling ...
i wish i didn' t . deep down , i can' t help feeling ... what ? a certain contempt for that boy .
he' s so transparent .
