23 . 976
this is a story of the past ... ... and the future .
we will come to the future , but first , the past .
here we have the earl of warwick .
we can see by his petulantly arched brow ... ... that he is not enroute to a good deed .
mmm .
obey !
enchanted .
do you wish to live , old witch ?
you have committed grave crimes ... ... against god and your king , have you not ?
have mercy , my lord .
silence .
the frenchman count thibault of malfete ... ... shall wed lady rosalind , the daughter of our king .
i desire that woman .
hmm .
i alone am fit to take her hand .
and her castle , lands , the riches that are her dowry .
thou art not as stupid as thou art hideous , old hag .
tomorrow night ... ... the king shall feast the arrival of the count .
i want the count dead before the feast is over .
a small fortune in gold ... ... awaits the sorceress who doth my bidding .
not so fast .
how shall i know thy magic is sufficient to the task ?
does thou find proof enough in this ?
aah !
that will do !
take it , witch !
was that proof enough , my lord ?
come to the king' s castle tomorrow night ... ... and carry out my plan .
if you fail ... you will be burned .
ohh !
our hero , of course , knew none of this .
he was safely in his entourage ... ... traveling , he thought , to his wedding .
here he is ... the count of malfete .
he is also a duke , a baron , and a lord .
a nobleman , plagued by only those small things ... ... which inconvenience a knight ... ... the permanent presence of his sisters ... ... his mother and father ... ... and , as all knights must endure ... ... an idiot servant , andre ... ... whose smell made people faint ... ... a considerable achievement ... ... among a population who never bathed .
down , peasant !
the duke , or thibault ... ... as his subjects were not allowed to call him ... ... was joyous .
the long awaited day of his marriage ... ... had come at last .
what have we got here ?
another lot of bloody royal bastards ?
must be that french duke ... ... come to marry the king' s daughter .
mind the forest !
there be dragons who' il make dinner ... ... from your bones in there !
andre loved and protected his master .
master !
master !
the forest ... it is haunted !
thibault responded .
thank you , master .
with every step ... ... he came closer to the castle of his beloved .
he hoped he would be with her soon ... ... for rare was the journey in which thibault ... ... did not have to stop and rescue someone .
this was no exception .
for like his ancestors ... ... he lived by an ancient family rule ...
a woman in distress !
the only one he knew .
aah !
aah !
beware , sire .
courage was more than a duty .
courage was his creed .
aah !
andre !
join your master !
i' m talking to you !
go , go !
stupid peasant !
sire !
behind you !
ohh !
naturally .
courage is our creed !
he was invincible .
except he was not invincible ... ... against witchcraft .
for this would be his last victory ... ... in this millennium .
afternoon , sir .
i hear a rumor ... ... thou art marrying tomorrow , my lord .
i have heard this rumor .
i have also heard ... ... the bride is the most beautiful in all of england .
but it is not true .
it is not ?
no .
am i not the most beautiful bride ... ... in all of england ?
no .
wait .
the most beautiful bride ... ... in all the world .
wear this for me , thibault .
wear it against thine heart .
thou shalt always be true .
lady rosalind .
thou shalt not disgrace thyself ... ... before the wedding .
i must hide and dress for the banquet .
ooh ooh ohh !
sire , your bride looks like a gorgeous sparrow .
silence , you impudent peasant .
show respect to your future mistress .
yes , master .
ah !
thank you , my lord .
quite so , your majesty .
when our lady drinks her wine ... ... her eyes will fill with hellish visions .
the count will appear as a hideous beast .
then my magic will compel her to kill him .
hahaha .
my dear friends and noble guests .
thibault , count of malfete and papincourt ... ... i hereby declare this castle a wedding present .
hearye !
your majesty , in every way that i am able ... ... i will serve my beautiful lady ... ... and do honor to thy kingdom .
drink of my cup and you will know my thoughts .
and thou will know mine .
uhh !
my lord ?
uhh !
thibault !
my lord !
ohh !
ohh !
aah !
what is it , thibault ?
this is not the kind of behavior .
what is happening to you , my son ?
are you crazy ?
drunk ?
count thibault , this is no way to behave ... ... in an english court !
beasts from hell !
ohh !
that is my mother !
thibault , that is my mother !
demon !
oh , no !
no !
what have i done ?
it is not me .
it is witchcraft !
andre , find me a wizard !
france must pay for this treachery .
find me a wizard !
have pity on a poor condemned man .
we are here for the last rites .
my lord !
we have to hurry .
what wizard is this ?
he' s english , my lord .
but his magic is very good .
your bloody earl of warwick did this to me .
indeed he did .
and he' d have me , too , if he knew that i was here .
i beg you , my sire .
let him save you .
can you bring my lady back from the dead ?
i can reanimate her corpse ... ... but i don' t think that my lord ... ... would like the way she looks ... or smells .
there is another way .
time is like a mountain .
riddled with tunnels .
i can open one of these tunnels for thee ... ... and return thee to the moment before the murder .
if thy will is strong enough .
don' t you think this priest has had enough time ?
hurry up , father .
unlock this door !
now !
drink this potion , my lord ... ... and thou shalt descend into the mountain of time .
ohh !
it smells awful .
you should not drink that .
what if you become a frog , or goat' s feet ?
you are right .
drink first , bastard .
and if you die , i will avenge your death .
what are you doing in there ?
open this door !
open this door !
it tastes like the shit of the pork .
and he should know .
ohh .
per horus et per ra ...
et per salem ... ... invictus .
ducere !
i forgot the grouse eggs .
oh , it' s a disaster .
i' ve lost them in the corridors of time .
open this door !
open this door !
wow .
cool !
this is cool .
this is pretty cool , yeah .
look at them !
shh .
see the peasant sleeping on the floor ?
in those days , people didn' t think ... ... that peasants deserved any better than that ... ... and they were considered the property of their masters .
now , the boss of this peasant is the knight .
see how beautiful the knight' s clothing is ?
miss rodett , that one is hot , and it just snorted !
now , tammy , that' s impossible ... ... because they' re just mannequins ... ... and mannequins don' t snort .
well , that one just did .
no , because they' re not real .
they' re just like ... dolls .
aaah !
oh , shit !
what are you doing in my chamber ?
aaaah !
your chamber ... ... has been cleaved in half , my lord .
this is not the castle !
what ?
oh , look at this , my sire !
it is satanic !
ohh .
this is hell , and we are condemned souls .
come .
we shall find the prince of this netherworld ... ... and beg his mercy .
wait for me , my lord !
dr. brady , come quick .
two guys with swords and armor ...
miller , you' re always overreacting .
now , relax .
there' s absolutely no need to ...
police are on their way .
peasant , please .
show me the way out of this prince castle !
yes !
pee yoo !
out this way .
they stink !
have a nice day .
bye .
good luck .
wait !
peasant !
wait !
stop !
what is this ?
the gates of hell !
look at its eyes of fire !
dragon !
it' s a red dragon !
attack !
what the hell are you doing ?
take that , beast !
we have killed it !
ah , yes .
it is no longer breathing .
god is punishing us for practicing the black arts .
let us pray for forgiveness .
heavenly father , forgive us our sins .
we are so , so , so , so , so ... so sorry .
dr. brady ?
ah , julia .
this is julia malfete ... ... who heads up the medieval art department .
she donated the famous 12th century castle exhibit .
julia designed the exhibit where we found the two men .
that stuff right there is the result of the body search .
the big guy had the gold coins ... ... the sword , the shield , and that ring .
the little guy had the salt pork ... ... the sausage , the dagger ... ... a molar .
and that box ... which he probably stole .
not from us .
most thieves take valuable things .
they usually don' t bring them .
this is a gothic pixis ... ... and this is the kind of design they were making in canterbury ... ... at the end of the 12th century .
it has emeralds and rubies .
why did the two men sleep here ?
they could' ve booked a suite at the ritz .
so , you said that you got these out of their pockets ?
that' s right .
except the sausage .
hmm .
mm hmm .
this stamp ring is fantastic .
my family' s coat of arms .
sergeant , can i meet these thieves ?
master , i' m hungry .
my tummy rumbles like a beast .
how can you think of food after such tragedy ?
yes .
what i would not give to see once more my precious ...
my lord !
look , she' s alive !
rosalind .
my fair rosalind .
my bride .
my ravishing flower .
mistress !
my mistress !
what are you doing ?
it is a miracle .
a miracle .
do i know you ?
do you not recognize me , my lady ?
i am the count of malfete and papincourt ... ... the duke of anjou .
i am your faithful thibault .
you' re who ?
and i am andre le pate , valet of the count .
please , forgive me for what i did to you ... ... my dear rosalind .
my name isn' t rosalind .
it' s julia .
no !
you are my rosalind .
the lock of hair you gave me on our wedding day .
i carry it over my heart .
please , my love , see for yourself .
you see ?
it is the color of wheat on a summer' s day .
the color of candle light .
it is your own .
stop this !
that' s enough !
rosalind !
you' il be safer outside !
do not leave me !
do not be afraid !
you don' t want to see this .
courage is our creed !
courage is our creed !
wait , stop !
i know this man !
courage is our creed .
that' s our family motto .
this man is my cousin .
it' s in here .
you see , i thought he was dead .
he disappeared when a storm ... ... capsized his yacht during the admiral' s cup .
they never recovered his body ... ... so , of course , declared him dead .
he was a very distant french cousin of mine ... ... but as the last living malfete , i inherited his estate .
if he' s your cousin ... ... what do you want me to do with him ?
sire .
why does lady rosalind call herself julia ... ... and allow us to be beaten and chained ?
peasant ... ... this is not our time .
the wizard did not send us into the past .
he sent us into the next millennium .
we are thirty generations removed from malfete .
julia is not my beloved .
she' s my descendant .
descendant ?
amber , it' s julia .
could you get me hunter ?
it' s important .
that rabbit of yours is on the phone again .
hey , bunny .
what' s up ?
thibault malfete just showed up at the museum .
thibault malfete ?
that' s impossible .
isn' t he supposed to be ...
i know .
are you sure it' s him ?
he looks exactly like his photos .
hunter , he quoted the family motto .
does he know yet that we' re selling his entire estate ?
well , it' s hard to say what he knows .
he' s a little strange .
hunter , this is terrible .
i mean , it' s wonderful that he' s alive ... ... but it' s terrible that we started to sell the estate .
oh , god , i feel awful .
the english courts declared him dead .
we' re well within our legal rights .
how were we supposed to know he was still alive ?
has he mentioned anything about money ?
money ?
how can you worry about money at a time like this ?
no , i' m just worrying about you .
you don' t handle surprises well .
where is your cousin now ?
he and this friend of his are downstairs with security .
why don' t we bring them home with us tonight ?
he' s family after all .
we want to be hospitable .
you' re wonderful .
i' il pick you all up in about five minutes .
love ya .
bye , bunny .
bye , big bear .
oh , my god .
thibault malfete' s still alive .
this is a disaster .
blah , blah , blah .
you' re pouting .
i hate it when you call her bunny .
you , my dear , are so much hotter than a bunny .
my god , look at yourself .
you' re a tigress .
ha ha ha ha ha .
aah !
lady julia , there has been a terrible mistake .
i' m so sorry .
we thought you were dead .
dead ?
no , the wizard was a fool , but not a killer .
he only sent us the wrong way .
excuse me ?
we fell into the mountain of time .
wow .
i must return to my time to prevent ... ... a great tragedy to our family .
i ask for your assistance .
i' il do whatever i can .
ohh !
awful .
ohh .
whoa !
we must not go out !
what ... what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
no , we have to wait outside .
hunter can' t park here .
we have to wait for him .
oh , my god .
bloody coward .
we have to ...
those boys are lost .
i must go and retrieve them .
aaah !
aah !
this is england ?
no ...
meat !
this is chicago .
meat , meat , meat !
this is the united states .
meat !
the last i remember was in sussex , england ... ... in my castle chambers .
you don' t remember anything since then ?
no .
do you think maybe you' ve suffered ... ... some sort of memory loss from the accident ?
yes !
after i drank the potion , i remember nothing .
onions ?
all of them !
all right .
you like to eat hot dogs , huh ?
i like to eat every kind of dog .
now , what are you doing ?
aargh !
leave the dogs !
no , no , no .

the long towel has a good fragrance .
thibault is my cousin , hunter .

julia , come down here !
it' s kind of an emergency .
very good fountain .

your french relatives are bathing in the toilet .
oh , my god .
toothbrushes .
i' il just leave them right here .

first you tell me your cousin' s nobility ... ... then you get mad at me when i suggest ... ... that just maybe , just maybe , he' s not .
now you' re upset because i pick the best restaurant in town .
you make it impossible for me to do the right thing .
no .
you' re right .
latour' s gonna be great .
thank you , big bear .
i' il be in the shower .

i have taken a bath at christmas .
bathe !
no , no !
i' m afraid !
i don' t want to catch cold and die !

do you realize the bath you just took ... ... cost over $2, 000 ?
that' s american dollars .

yes , it is .

well , i forgot .
hello !

somebody there with you ?
aah !
jesus !

i think he hung up the phone .
it was thibauit' s little retarded homuncular assistant .
look , this is dangerous .
i' il call you back after julia goes to bed , ok ?
lady julia .
you are more than a rose .
you are love' s own flower .
come on .
that' s ridiculous .
no , i just ...
this old thing , i threw it on .
i haven' t worn it in a couple of years ... ... but i guess i should learn how to take a compliment .
thank you .
almost .
thank you .
much better .
kissing cousins .
ooh la la .
i don' t think that i' ve ever seen anyone ... ... eat a steak in two bites before .
ah .
thank you , master !
be blessed !
i can assure you ...
thank you !
like some more truffle sauce with that ?
excuse me , but the gentleman ... ... can' t eat off the floor .
he' s not a gentleman .
he' s my servant ... ... and he' s not worthy of our company .
thank you .
i' m truly sorry , sir .
andre , would you please ...
no , no , milady .
it is not possible .
please .
thibault , please , will you let him sit at the table ?
for me ?
i will please you , lovely one .
obey , foolish wart .
thank you .
and you were worried they wouldn' t be comfortable .
actually , the floor wasn' t such a bad place for him .
easier to hose down .
cheese !
very good cheese !
andre , what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
andre ?
no , no !
andre , no .
no .
bad !
hey .
sit down .
eat this .
hunter , could you ...
no .
this is for dessert .
all right ?
please , sir , please .
i' m sorry .
i' m terribly sorry .
just add it to the check .
ok , all right ?
thank you .
you eat this after dinner .
allright ?
no , it' s allright .
i' m terribly sorry .
just add it to the bill .
thank you .
all right .
do i have something on my face ?
you remind me of the daughter of a king .
thank you .
on the subject of julia' s noble ancestry ... ... you do understand why she was granted control of the estate ?
julia is a malfete .
everything i have is hers .
so you have no objection if she retains control ?
no .
wonderful .
i' m sure you' il be very pleased with our plans .
they' re going to make us ...
i mean you and julia ... very wealthy .
i am already wealthy .
i own hundreds of horses ... ... ten chests of pepper , four hundred bags of wool ... ... and fifty barrels of spanish olives .
and you own me , sire .
yes , but you have no value .
that is true .
excuse you .
leave nothing for the devil !
did you hear that ?
yes , i did , sweetheart .
they' re not in very good health , all right ?
so , just try to ignore it , if you can .
sire .
what ?
i want to make pee pee .
ah !
you want to pee ?
yes .
outside !
outside ?
but , sire ...
i could be eaten by the wolves .
find a torch !
idiot .
find a torch .
andre has such simple needs .
i think that' s great .
need some help , sir ?
oh , it is beautiful .
the water comes out by itself .
ha !
it is a magic fountain .
look at this !
mmm .
it smells just like the forest .
all the forest is in the small wheel .
mmm .
smell it !
no .
no , thank you .
you don' t want to smell it ?
enjoy yourself .
the castle' s a wreck .
so i' m helping her divide the estate up ... ... into more manageable , profitable chunks .
we' re selling the art and various high end pieces ... ... through an outlet here .
essentially , i' m protecting her .
i see that as my role .
and the land ?
i decided we should sell that , too .
it is not for you to decide .
only lady julia can say what will be done .
i speak for both julia and myself .
you cannot possibly speak for a malfete .
what are your wishes , milady ?
well , um ...
i guess i' d like to think about it ... ... a little bit more , actually .
julia ?
the lady has spoken !
chicken salad , now !
i want that cake .
come on now .
don' t take all night .
greasy chicken .
what on earth do you think you' re doing ?
hi , andre .
i' m afraid i' m going to have to add an order ... ... of chicken a la umbrella to your bill .
smell the forest .
yes , it' s minty .
it' s from the blue fountain .
nice .
yeah .
oh , all right .
honey , would you like a mint ?
yeah .
all right .
good .
thibault ?
master .
those are good .
give me another one .
yes .
very minty .
ow !
ah ...
good evening , fine sir .
i' m seeking thibault of malfete ... ... the duke of anjou .
the great chevalier ?
andre does not need a bed .
he will be happy with some straw .
yes .
we' re out of straw .
my bed is soft .
it' s time for the " family feud .
aah !
oh !
poor little people .
they' re trapped inside !
oh !
god have mercy .
what are we going to do , my sire ?
free them .
chuck , marilyn , norma , terry , and linda .
now let' s start the " family feud " !
bunny ?
you really think these guys have amnesia ?
i don' t know .
we are coming !
so you admit they' re clinically insane ?
i didn' t say that .
oh , come on !
where did they go , my lord ?
they were inside .
we could not save them .
it is tragic .
well , we never really used this room anyway .
it' s a pity .
aah !
i need to find a wizard now .
um ...
do you mind if i get some coffee first ?
hi .
jesus christ !
i' ve told you not to leave this stuff ... ... in the middle of the driveway !
what are you trying to do ?
you just about broke my goddamn neck !
i' m sorry .
i didn' t mean to .
do you actually do any gardening around here ... ... or do you just sing out of tune ?
just clean it up !
aah !
oh !
hey , big belly !
you dare to touch a lady ?
who the hell are you ?
i' m andre , and i piss on you .
yeah , well , you get the hell out of here ... ... or i' m gonna call the cops .
apologize to the lady .
lady ?
you' re calling her a ...
lady .
right .
i' m sorry .
kiss her feet .
do what ?
kiss her feet !
oh , jesus !
instead of a wizard ...
i think what we really need to find you is a good doctor .
wizards are the best doctors .
what in the world is that ?
what are you doing ?
call 911 !
what is going on here ?
he was very rude to the lady .
look , fool .
a coat of arms .
he is a nobleman .
i did not know .
stupid peasant .
who are these guys ?
visitors .
do you own this woman ?
she works for me .
then i will hang my valet by his feet on your behalf .
no , please , my lord .
not by the feet !
i prefer the thumbs .
i got a meeting to catch .
rise , idiot .
i give him to you for the day .
you may beat him if you like .
thanks , but , you know , we just met .
thank you , my great and merciful master .
thank you , milord !
thank you !
let us go .
