miss mayor , over here !
your honor , how do you answer those who are opposed to the street improvement project you put before the city council today ?

maybe they' il disappear into a pothole .
your son' s relationship with melanie carmichael sources say they' re engaged .
do you have a comment ?
trust me , if my son were engaged , i' d have a comment .
i thought you were tired .
jimmy , can you excuse us for a second ?

come on , let' s call your parents .
no !
i i mean ... [ chuckles nervously ]
n not right this second .
what i mean is , uh ...
honey , would you mind terribly if we just kept this to ourselves for a few days ?
mel , it' s gonna come out sooner or later .
no , l i know , i know , but , um , it' s just , i haven' t seen my folks in about 7 years , and i just feel like i should probably tell them in person .
of course .
and , um ... i i think i should do it alone .
mel , i' m gonna have to meet them eventually .
i i know , i know , and they will love you ... eventually .
is it because i' m a yankee ?
well , that ... and a democrat .
okay ... mum' s the word .
no one will know .
thank you .
secretary hennings , will you comment ...
secretary hennings ...
okay .
hello .
why haven' t you told your mother you' re engaged ?
have you thought about children ?
i' m sorry we' re late .
that shade of lipstick does nothing for you .
what kept you ?
oh , it' s none of your business .
ah , you know i hate surprises .
what' s going on ?
oh , tom , always a pleasure .
good to see you .
melanie , darling .
hi , your honor .
so good to see you .
look at you always the belle of the ball .
i hear very good things about your new line .
oh , yeah .

um ...
andrew ?
yes ?
seems melanie is wearing a skating rink on a very important finger .
um , your honor , i' d really like to keep it
oh , my god , you' re engaged ? !
quiet .
bloody hell , mel , i' m your first new york friend , and i have to read about it with 12 million other people !
sorry , honey , she just grabbed my hand .
what was i supposed to do ?
i know we read all about it .
so , did you cry ?
wouldn' t you ?
one man for the rest of my life ?
i' d bawl my bloody eyes out .
so why don' t you meet us ?
we' re just around the corner .
can' t .
i' m in alabama .
oh ... my god .
yeah .
aw , he' s loud , but he don' t bite .
come on , shut up , hound !
lie down .
go on , stay .
now , how can i help you ?
well , for starters , you can get your stubborn ass down here and give me a divorce .
come on , jake , i mean it .
the joke' s over .
let' s just finish this .
i' ve got a plane to catch .
you' re shittin ' me , right ?
you know , i' ve never actually understood that expression , but , no , i' m not " shitting " you .
look , it' s even got these idiot proof tabs to make it easy .
there' s one copy for me , one copy for you , and one copy for the lawyers .
what ?
speak !
you show up here after 7 years without so much as a " hey , there , jake , remember me ... your wife ?
or a " hi , honey .
lookin ' good .
how' s the family ?
you expect me to tell you you look good ?
did they run out of soap down at the piggly wiggly since i left ?
they laugh at that up north or wherever it is you been ?
you knew where i was .
and don' t even pretend you spent all this time missing me .
oh , i missed you , all right .
but at this range , my aim is bound to improve .
is that a threat ?
i' ve got a lawyer who charges $350 an hour .
he billed me every time you sent these papers back .
well , i' m glad to see you finally got the message .
shut up , bear !
shut up , bryant !
what happened to bear ?
he died .
you weren' t here .
what are you doing ? !
leavin ' .
you done it .
you should recognize the gesture .
could we just try to keep this as civilized as possible ?
please sign these papers so i can go home .
what do you know from home ?
hell , i bet your folks don' t even know you' re in town .
that' s my business .
honey , those people are the only family you got .
don' t you " honey " me , honey !
get your butt back in that car , you drive over and see ' em , and then maybe we' il talk .
jake !
you dumb , stubborn , redneck hick !
the only reason you won' t sign these papers is ' cause i want you to !
wrong !
the only reason i ain' t signin ' is ' cause you' ve turned into some hoity toity yankee bitch , and i' d like nothin ' better right now than to piss you off !
unh !
what are you doin ' with mose plydell' s plane anyhow ? !
that' s my business !
fine !
fine !
divorce , my ass .
hey , genius ... [ sighs ]
next time you lock somebody out , make sure they don' t know where the spare key' s hidden .
well , see , that' s the thing about hide a keys it' d be nice if your wife told you where it was !
i' m not your wife , jake .
i' m just the first girl that climbed in the back of your truck .
but you' re right i have changed .
i don' t even know that girl anymore .
well , then ... allow me to remind you .
born into one of the wealthiest families of greenville , alabama , her daddy' s in cotton and all that that implies .
there' s no listing for an earl carmichael in greenville .
how about her local high school ?
no record of a melanie carmichael attending ... ever .
jesus !
whatever happened to responsible journalism ?
there' s something wrong here .
why would my son do this to me ?
maybe he , um , loves her .
oh , please !
this is classic rebound .
he' s still wounded from who was his last girlfriend ?
whitney truesdale , lawyer , san francisco .
yeah , well , there was a match made in heaven society , political family , california all those electoral votes .
get andrew on the phone .
since we have a small window for the secretary of housing , please hold your questions until after the presentation .
gentlemen .
did you see the look on my mom' s face ?
i thought her head was going to explode .
yeah , what did she say ?
that i should date women like melanie , not marry them .
that' s harsh .
that' s mom .
thank you .
thanks a lot .
we hope to have the bronx children' s hospital
open by fall 2003 .
oh , speak of the devil .
hello ?
so , have you two lovebirds set a date ?
i' m pleading the fifth .
okay , fine , just try to keep your secrets .
i dare you .
oh , at least you sound like you' re in a better mood .
my approval rating went up 2 points .
it seems the public likes being reminded i am a mother .
god , always running for office .
i' m only thinking of you .
say , um ... do you happen to have the carmichaels ' number down there in greenville ?
i thought perhaps i should introduce myself .
i would like to meet them first , if you don' t mind .
you do realize the press is going to be all over this .
happy couples don' t sell .
so if there are any skeletons in her closet , andrew , we need to know about them .
you make clothes , right ?
i design them .
there' s a big difference .
did you design anything with stripes ?
you called the sheriff ? !
you know that old bastard hates me !
for good reason !
well , hell' s bells , if it ain' t felony melanie .
wade !
hot damn , girl , do we miss you around here !
hey , i think i saw poor , old fuzz just the other day .
oh , god , you had to bring that up .
i can' t believe you' re the sheriff !
yep , i get to frisk pretty little things like you all day and get paid for it .
wade , can you try and be a little more professional ?
we got us a crime suspect here .
now , melanie , you can' t just go breaking into people' s houses .
i didn' t break in , wade .
i used a key my key .
well , it still ain' t your house , darlin ' .
i' m gonna have to escort you out .
use the cuffs , wade , please ?
if you get him to sign these , i' il let you run me out of town .
now , that' s none of your concern .
well , what do we got here ?
a bill of divorcement ?
mm hmm .
hell , boy , i thought you said you took care of this .
and i thought i had .
obviously not .
well , if you two are still married , it' s her house , too .
this here ain' t nothin ' but a domestic dispute .
he didn' t hit you , did he ?
if he took a swing at you , i' il take him in right now .
we take that stuff pretty serious nowadays .
no , wade , jake' s never hit me .
you know what ?
i don' t have a single childhood memory that doesn' t have you two in it .
and that includes the night i lit my ass on fire .
remember ?
wade ...
memory lane is closed .
ah , boy , you two got a whole lot of catchin ' up to do ... so i' m just gonna leave you to it .
man , i set you up with your wife .
you owe me one !
why won' t you just sign the papers ? !
hey , there is nothin ' i can do .
the law is the law , and she has done nothin ' wrong .
i suppose shoplifting steaks at winn dixie' s okay .
oh !
oh !
oh !
oh !
oh !
i took ' em back , and you know it !
you remember that vandalism out at the stockyard ?
totally her !
like i could tip a cow by myself .
hmm .
wade ... isn' t there some outstanding warrant for whoever dumped your mama' s tractor in the fishpond ?
we only have 10 of these , and it' s gonna be gone for good .
so if you are loving this monster
we have eight only ?
if i knew how to say that in ltalian , i would , but i don' t .
um , if you love this ... 9 : 15 ?
honestly .
who could be callin ' at this hour ?
hello ?
hel lo ?
hey , mama .
melanie ?
is that you ?
oh , it' s so late .
are you all right ?
i , uh ... um ...
i just thought i' d surprise you .
well , this certainly is a fine surprise , hearing from you you know , being such a busy girl and all .
of course , i call people while i' m doin ' the dishes or shellin ' peas .
oprah calls it " multitasking .
mama , the call isn' t the surprise .
i i' m in town .
oh , lord , love a duck !
ha !
oh , my baby girl has finally come home .
earl , she' s in town .
you gonna repeat everything she says ?
if you are , get off my chair .
mama ...
i' m just sittin ' here , is all .
what happened to the sound ?
i turned it down so i could hear the phone ring .
mama !
what , are you a clairvoyant ?
it was so loud , i couldn' t hear myself think .
mama ...
they could have heard it at joe and lurlynn' s house .
hello ?
i only get 3 minutes .
oh , honey , you didn' t need to call , then .
just come on by .
uh ... well , that' s the thing .
i was sorta hoping daddy could come get me .
so , what put you in jail this time ?
jake and his big , fat mouth .
it' s just a misunderstanding , that' s all .
yeah , kinda like that weddin ' i paid for , huh ?
i would hardly call that a wedding .
boy was nervous .
he was still drunk from the night before .
can you blame him ?
yes , i can !
i went to the reception by myself with puke all down my dress while he slept it off in the travelodge , and you' re still siding with that
i' m not sidin ' with anybody .
the boy' s changed , is all .
can we just not talk about jake , okay ?
i i know he' s the son you never had , but i' m your only daughter , and maybe you want to know what' s new with me .
okay , shoot .
i met somebody ... and he' s quite a catch .
h he' s really a great guy .
and i' m happy ... really .
come to mama , sugar !
hey , mama .
oh , good land of the livin ' , you are skin and bones .
well , don' t i get a smile ?
i know you got one in there somewhere .
come on , come on , let' s not let all the bought air out .
well , are you hungry , sweetie ?
do you want me to reheat you some chicken fried steak ?
oh , no , mama , i' m fine .
sweetie , you look tired .
are you tired ?
oh , you know what ?
maybe it' s the way you' re wearing your hair now .
you guys have really done a lot with the place .
lord , would you listen to that accent ?
why don' t you sit in my good chair ?
now , your mama got me this christmas before last .
oh , you mean the one where you were supposed to come visit me ?
i told you time and time again , it just didn' t suit .
let me let me get you those tickets .
sit down in it .
sit down .
now , watch this .
ahh !
oh !
oh !
i mean , isn' t that quite the deal ?
there are hardly words .
now , how do i get out of this thing ?
oh ...
oh , my god !
jake tell you he' s thinkin ' of gettin ' one ?
oh , i see your priorities
jake , jail , and then home .
mama , it was just unfinished business , is all .
jake' s doin ' all right .
boy' s goin ' places .
once upon a time , you were goin ' places , too .
here are your tickets .
these were a gift .
i' d rather you guys just use them .
you know what i can' t understand is how y' all will visit every stupid battlefield in the continental u. s. , but you can' t manage to visit your only daughter .
well , the door swings both ways , sweetie .
anyway , don' t get me started on the things i don' t understand .
here we go .
your dream for me was to get out of this place and be somebody .
you shoved me in every beauty pageant in the state .
i' m just sayin ' , is all .
what ? !
what are you trying to say ? !
i i mean , just tell me what i can do to make you happy !
just make yourself happy , darlin ' .
done .
we' re there , all right ?
you know , i' ve really made something of myself .
i have a career .
people actually want to be me .
and somebody loves me , and i love him .
pearl , why don' t you get us that baloney cake out the icebox ?
your mama' s a complex woman .
i' m going to bed .
good night , darlin ' .
but you know nothing about her .
are you even sure who she is ?
i love her , mom .
that' s nice , but you have to be careful .
you and i are different .
we' re not better , not worse we' re just different .
we' re in public life to serve , and to serve to the best of our abilities , we have to set good examples .
do you have to control everything ?
i' ve put a hold on the plaza for the second weekend in june .
that should give you a nice , long engagement .
we were thinking christmas in lreland .
if you think i' m going to let some girl talk you into getting married
she is not " some girl . " any place but new york city .
she' s my fiancee , for christ' s sake .
you are just like your father .
one minute you' re brilliant , controlled , steadfast .
the next you' re throwing it all away on some young piece of ass .
those are your issues , mother .
not mine .
okay ...
hold on .
you know what ?
uh ...
how long does a contested divorce take ?
18 months ? !
mr. buford , i don' t have 18 months .
i don' t have 18 days .
okay , well , that' s just not gonna work for me .
u uh , ye yes .
whoo hoo !
don' t see the likes of you around these here parts much !
mr. buford , that' s not gonna work .
lady , you look like sex on a stick in that
frederick montana getup !
i have to call you back .
listen , bubba , why don' t you just kiss my ... ... ass !
oh , my god !

' cause i don' t do that sort of thing on the street .
i guess your mama raised you right .
whoo !
what is that ?
calvin klein ?
that' s very nice .
very good .
i i better back off .
don' t want to get you in trouble with the little lady .
there is a little lady , isn' t there ?
i can hardly afford me , much less some high maintenance babe .
what about cindy what' s her name ?
you guys were real hot and heavy in high school .
she' s a women' s softball coach up in nashville .
mm hmm .
oh ...
well , that explains some lingering questions that i had about a game of post office we played one time .
no !
i guess we all have our little secrets , don' t we , bobby ray ?
yeah , we sure do .
' course , i read about yours on the lnternet .
what ? !
oh , i know all about the cocks in your henhouse .
oh , god !

well ... congratulations .
thanks .

just a guess , but i' m thinking the words " joint checking " are flashing in your head right now .
how much did you take ?
all of it .
son of a bitch !
you want a wife , you got a wife .
and what are you doing with all that cash ?
why don' t you invest it ?

nobody finds their soul mate when they' re 10 years old .
yeah , i guess .

you never did anything to me , darlin ' ... or any other girl in town .
melanie , what is the matter with you ?

i guess i wouldn' t blame you .
forgotten how beautiful this place was .

bobby ray , it' s not like that .
you know what ?
i' il tell you what it' s not like .
it' s not like jake' s the only one that you run out on .
i' m so sorry i outed you .
i guess i figured if i was pointing at you , then ... nobody would see through me .
bobby ray , i can' t find the fuse !
i should go before he kills himself .
bye .
afternoon .
can i help you ?
barry lowenstein , " new york post .
ho ho , boy , am i glad to see you .
i' il tell you , it' s , uh ... definitely , uh , another world down here .
uh , did you say the " post " ?
yes , i did .
i i was hoping to get an interview with you and your family maybe , um , a few pictures if you don' t mind ?
no .
i mean , uh , yes , i do ... mind .
they' re not here .
oh ... wow .
this is just as you described it .
it must have been amazing , huh , growing up here ?
like a fantasy .
would you mind if i take a quick look inside ?
actually , i' m on my way out .
i' il come back , then .
uh , uh , okay , but just a peek .
this is it home sweet home .
wow !
how old is this place ?
uh ... it was built by my , uh , great great great grandfather ,
charles carmichael , in 1853 .
oh , boy , i bet you slid down this banister a time or two .
oh .
and over here we have the , um ... [ maid humming ]
... kitchen , but who hasn' t seen one of those ?
let' s start over here .
oh .
now , this is my favorite room .
it was part of the , um , underground railroad .
why are we whispering ?
the whole place is haunted ... by ghosts of , um , the civil war soldiers .
jake !
no wonder we lost the war .
was that one of ' em ?
melanie ?
what are you doin ' in a closet ?
hi .
barry lowenstein , " new york post .
miss carmichael is just showing me around the plantation .
uh , mr. lowenstein is writing a piece on the family , you know , since i' m marrying the mayor' s son and all .
i had no idea .
isn' t that something ?
yeah .
well , a plantation by any other name is just a farm .
but it does roll off the tongue a little sweeter , doesn' t it ?
huh .
well , i do believe miss melanie forgot her manners .
i' m bobby ray ... her cousin .
charmed .
see , when the yankees marched through alabama , they tried to destroy our metal formin ' capabilities by placin ' barrels of powder underneath the anvils .
of course , all that managed to do was blow ' em sky high for a few seconds .
so ... in honor of that act of stupidity , we all we get together to re create it for the tourists .
aah !
yee haw !
what the hell was that ? !
hey , grandpa !
this here' s barry !
he' s doin ' an article on melanie' s weddin ' !
never heard of her .
thanks !
well , aren' t you just a big , fat liar .
bobby ray !
oh , go back to new york .
** if fear' s what makes us decide **
** our future journey **
** well , i' m not along for a life **
** i' m not along for a life **
** ' cause i' m still yearning **
** l l i am falling down **
** try and stop me **
** it feels so good to hit the ground **
** you can watch me **
** i fall right on my face **
** it' s an uphill human race **
** and l i am falling down **
hmm .
hello .
i' m sorry about what i said .
really sorry .
melanie , forget it .
she was not sharing .
okay , y' all , you need to eat and be quiet .
we' re gonna have us a little visit .
** ye a , ye a , ye a , yeah **
** oh , l l i am falling down **
** try and stop me **
** it feels so good to hit the ground **
you know , he went up there .
who ?
jake ?
when ?
about a year after you left .
he doesn' t know i know , but clinton let it slip once .
jake was in new york ?
he told clinton he' d never seen anything like it .
he realized straight off he' d need more than an apology to win you back .
he needed to conquer the world first .
he' s been tryin ' ever since .
that' s why he kept sending the papers back .
yeah .
hmm .
it' s funny how things don' t work out .
it' s funny how they do .
** now , listen here **
** well , i tried to tell you , baby **
** but that don' t make no sense **
** now you got me , baby **
** up against that fence **
** ain' t that a shame ? ** ** shame **
** shame , shame the way you do **
ha ha !
ha !
hey , look who i found hangin ' out by the parkin ' lot .
hesitant to join us .
** shame , shame , shame on you **
anybody think of anything in here that , uh , might bother bobby ray ?
uh , clinton' s breath ?
ha !
you still the same bobby ray from last night ?
last time i checked , yeah .
well , then , i' m gonna buy you a drink .
well , you' re really not my type , i mean ... [ laughter ]
oh , honey , you you drink that from the top .
i' m just lookin ' to see who makes this deep south glass .
i wonder if you can get it in new york .
it' s beautiful .
hey , jake , mel would like to know where she can find some of that snooty faluty glass .
why ask me ?
oh , i don' t know .
maybe because you' re [ clears throat ]
you' re all spiffed up and and all .
am i missin ' somethin ' ?
let' s show some respect .
jake ...
when was the last time you pushed me around the floor ?
clinton here has got two left feet .
well , ms. taylor , i' d be honored .
let' s do it .
come on .
come on , mel , get on out here !
well , aren' t you the lord of the dance ?
i ain' t as clumsy as i look .
she just can' t keep time .
you might have to prove that to me .
whoo !
** now , i heard mr. young sing about her **
you know , he' s pretty good .
it might be you .
oh , the hell you say .
let me at him .
** i hope neil young will remember **
aw , look at them two welded together .
why do they fight it ?
** sweet home alabama **
maybe we could just talk .
** sweet home alabama **
** lord , i' m comin ' home to you **
come on , let' s go to the roadhouse .
nah .
what do you say we drive out to fairview and bowl ?
i don' t think so .
do you want to go harass somebody ?
unh unh .
hey , i know this great place where we can
no !
y' all , i think i' m gonna call it a night .
hi , there , boy .
sorry it took me so long .
i would have come sooner if i' d known you were sick .
actually , that' s probably not true .
i' ve been pretty selfish lately .
dogs don' t know anything about that , do they , though ?
you were always like a big old pillow .
like when everything went pear shaped ... [ voice breaking ]
you never left my side .
and then i just left you .
i bet you sat there wondering what you' d done wrong .
i told him it was my fault .
quit bein ' so nice .
it' s the truth .
how come it has to be so complicated ?
what ?
truth ... [ sniffs ] life ... this .
he was one hell of a good dog , wasn' t he ?
yeah .
you looked like you were having fun out there tonight .
i' m happy in new york , jake .
but then i come down here and ... this fits , too .
since when does it have to be one or the other ?
you can have roots and wings , mel .
maybe i could just fly south for the winter .
look .
what ?
there .
do you see ' em ?
lightning bugs ?
only you .
you know , i still go out there sometimes .
i see those big thunderheads rollin ' in .
it' s like a religion .
i had a dream about it the other night .
you ever wonder what would have happened if we hadn' t have gotten pregnant ?
jake ...
just ...
iet me get this out before i can' t .
i thought that baby would be an adventure .
and it took me a while to realize it would have been your only adventure .
i just guess mother nature knew better , huh ?
i was so ashamed ... ... ' cause i felt ... relieved .
and all of a sudden , i just ... needed a different life .
you done real well for yourself .
i' m proud of you , mel .
i' m just sorry i never danced with you at our weddin ' .
i' m sure this next one' s gonna go better for ya .
jake , i can' t do this .
hey ...
i know .
go home .
well , i' m just sayin ' , is all .
i mean , i i saw the way you two were lookin ' at each other .
will you just shut up about it , mama ? !
i can' t help the way jake feels about me !
he hasn' t done anything wrong !
he hasn' t done anything right either !
i can' t believe i' m even having this argument !
i' m leaving !
i' m gone !
i' m marrying another man !
yes , that' s right , you get a second chance , so please don' t mess it up !
for who ?
for me or for you ?
don' t sass me , okay ?
don' t you dare sass me , ' cause i have put up with an awful lot from you over the years .
like what ? !
l like me quitting your precious pageants ?
i didn' t want you to end up like me !
damn it !
now , you need to stay as far away from here as you can .
that boy is quicksand .
what' s so wrong with being you , mama ?
i just think that you deserve better , that' s all .
i know you do .
you always have .
i' il see you in new york , all right ?
mm hmm .
you' il like it .
i promise .
now , don' t you forget to say goodbye to your daddy .
fire !
fire !
fire !
fire !
fire !
daddy ?
daddy ?
daddy !
who ya lookin ' for , darlin ' ?
earl smooter .
5th regiment ?
anybody seen earl smooter ?
he' s about to surrender !
thank you !
after you .
afternoon .
how are ya ?
good , thanks .
yourself ?
no complaints .
that' s a beautiful house .
sure .
yeah .
you , uh , you here to see bobby ray ?
actually , i' m , uh , hoping to surprise melanie .
melanie ?
my fiancee .
you got the wrong house , don' t ya ?
this is , uh , the carmichael place , isn' t it ?
are we talkin ' about the same girl ?
melanie smooter ?
melanie carmichael .
oh , well , that explains it .
that sure does .
andrew hennings .
nice meeting you , jake .
hey , jake .
what' s goin ' on ?
oh , you know ,
i' m just , uh , talkin ' to mel' s fiance here .
wonder if you might know where she is .
andrew hennings .
you must be
i i' m bobby ray ... her , uh , cousin ?
i see you' ve already met jake ... her , uh
other cousin .
family !
god , it' s great to meet you both .
i think melanie said somethin ' last night about , uh , visitin ' her daddy u up at the up at the battlefield .
the battlefield ?
you know us southerners .
i mean , the minute the confederacy died , it became a moral issue .
come on , i' il , uh , i' il give you a ride up there .
that' s great .
thank you .
all right .
nice meeting you .
** what this world needs is a few more rednecks **
** so people ain' t afraid to take a stand **
so , who' s ...
melanie ... smooter ?
local hero around here .
why is that ?
she blew up the bank .
and that made her a hero ?
well , notorious , anyway .
she was 10 .
oh .
fortunately , nobody was hurt ... except , maybe , the cat .
what cat ?
the one with the dynamite on its back .
she blew up a cat ?
he was scheduled to die .
from dynamite ?
the vet said it had cancer , so eldon thought it' d be put in one of those chambers , you know , the ones that suck their lungs out .
little mel , she couldn' t bear the thought of that .
she , uh , she wanted somethin ' more humane .
yeah , sure .
so , they were doing some blastin ' out by the new highway .
so , we , uh , we took old fuzz up there , taped him up .
used about 30 feet of fuse just to be on the safe side , said our prayers , and ran like hell .
of course .
so , there we were , sittin ' in virgie' s diner , feelin ' pretty blue .
when mel looks up and sees that damn cat , trottin ' down the road , searchin ' for eldon .
no shit .
yeah , and we would have caught him , too , but once that fuse hit his tail , boom , he took off like a shot .
and into the bank .
well ... the theory is , he probably wriggled loose from the explosive .
' cause , uh , people still see him from time to time , scorched tail and all .
he' s a little skittish around humans .
that' s quite a story .
she was quite a girl .
** a little less talk and a little more action **
whatever happened to her ?
** and a few more rednecks ... **
oh , you know ... wound up pregnant , married some loser right out of high school .
are you surprised ?
what are you doing here ?
well , i came to deliver your fiance .
i think she was talking to me .
jake ...
must be exhaustin ' .
what ?
what ?
livin ' a lie .
what' s he talking about ?
you and i are in love with two different people .
is he a second cousin ?
he' s my husband .
your what ?
i mean my ex husband .
you married your cousin ? !
no , i came down here to finalize my divorce .
hey , darlin ' , thought that was you .
must be your new someone .
earl smooter glad to meet ya .
melanie smooter .
andrew , wait .
wait !
andrew !
wait !
i just
please .
let me try and explain myself !
you don' t understand !
this is not who i am anymore !
look , i don' t know who you are or what else you lied about , but i know one thing there is a lear jet in mobile , and i am on it .
i know you' re thinkin '
i spoiled things good this time .
oh , hon , don' t go accusin ' me of thinkin ' .
i ain' t done anything of the sort .
anyway , spoiled' s in the eye of the beholder ... ... iike these plums here .
some people might call them " spoiled " ... but i think that , um , these almost ruined ones sometimes make the sweetest jam .
do you need any help ?
it was kind of fun , seeing daddy up there , surrendering .
yeah .
he sure does have a flair for the dramatic .
you certainly don' t get it from my side of the family .
hey , y' all .
look who i found walkin ' down l 58 .
hi .
hi .
i thought you' d be halfway to new york by now .
so did l .
ooh , if i' d known company was comin ' ,
i' d have put on the dog .
this is my mama .
hi .
she makes the best jam in three counties .
oh .
and my dad you you already met him .
yeah .
and this is our home .
this is where i grew up .
well , it' s a pleasure meeting you both .
i' m ... andrew hennings ...
melanie' s fiance well ... that is ... if if she' il still have me .
look , mel ...
i really don' t care what happened down here .
so ... you have a past .
i mean , who doesn' t ?
what i need to know is if there is a place for me in your future .
oh , good lord .
that is the sweetest thing .
well , go on .
oh !
hello , new york city !
woman , what the hell you gassin ' about ?
well , sir ... my mother happens to be the mayor up there , and , uh , she' d like nothing better than a big , snazzy new york wedding .
well , uh ... yeah , i suppose i can take off work .
andrew , i , um ... actually , i was thinking , maybe we could have the wedding here .
here .
in my hometown .
look , mel , if you' re worried about the money , don' t .
it' s not about the money , andrew ... not down here .
you know ... a lot of people are expecting us to get married in the city , but i think a nice , quiet , country wedding is just the ticket .
earl ...
pearl , if you if you folks could take care of the rehearsal dinner ,
i' d really like to take care of the rest .
well , i think we could cover that .
heck .
how many times does your only daughter get married ?
other than before .
felony melanie ?
she was never convicted .
oh ho .
i don' t know which is worse child cat killer or sons of the confederacy .
what would you suggest i do dump her for being poor ?
you' re supposed to be a democrat , remember ?
there is nothing wrong with being poor .
i get elected by poor people , and i' m a big enough person to commend her for making something of herself .
what upsets me is that she lied to you .
so what ?
she was ashamed of her background .
who hasn' t been embarrassed by their parents at one point ?
i' m going to assume that was a rhetorical question .
assume away .
no one is going to change my mind about this not you , not the media , not anyone .
fine ... but admit it ...
i was right .
yes ... you were right .
there is a wedding in your future , whether you like it or not .
and how , exactly , does little miss alabama plan to accommodate 500 people ?
i suppose she has connections at the jail .
well , there are several excellent choices the travelodge , days lnn , a motel 6 , oh , and the golden cherry motel , where we will be .
laugh now , but if this gets out
it won' t .
the press expects the plaza in june .
** something' s **
** been creepin ' into my head **
** turnin ' my thoughts **
** lnto a dizzy red **
now , let' s talk about your wedding .
this place is gorgeous , and we can control the security .
the carmichael plantation ?
it did inspire your identity , did it not ?
you thought of everything .
yeah , well , i always do .
been great .
keep in touch .
** now you have come **
** to get some lofty role **
** oh , you got me walkin ' backwards **
** you got me thinkin ' sideways **
** you got me talkin ' circles **
** you got me losin ' my way **
** you got me crossin ' every line ** [ ringing continues ]
** you got me just in **
** time ** [ ringing stops ]
you guys remember the sheik .
yeah .
well , he proposed to me , and i think i loved him , despite his billions .
then why didn' t you say " yes " ?
because i hesitated long enough to realize my head and my heart were saying two different things .
it' s this way .
