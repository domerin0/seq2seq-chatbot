# it' s ladies ' night , oh , what a night ...

but then i learned something i will never forget .
oscar' s dad' s a tongue scrubber !
tongue scrubber !
tongue scrubber !

my dad was the greatest .
but nobody loves a nobody .

oscar , you don' t have to live at the top of the reef to be a somebody .
what' s the difference ?
if i don' t pay mr. sykes back by tomorrow ...
i' m dead anyway , so ...
wait here .
what' s this ?
a pink pearl ?
mm hm .
where' d you get that ?
my grandmother gave it to me .
she said it started from a tiny grain of sand , but then , after a while , it grew into something beautiful .
dreams can begin small too .
no .
no , i couldn' t ...
take it .
it' il get you the money you need for mr. sykes .
what do you mean , you don' t understand ?
we' ve been over it 1, 000 times .
i don' t want to have to say it again .
you' re really giving me agita .
i don' t know how else to say this .
you see something , you kill it , you eat it .
period .
thanks .
that' s what sharks do .
that' s a fine tradition .
what' s the matter with you ?
your brother frankie , here , he' s a killer .
thanks , pop .
he' s beautiful .
he does what he' s supposed to do .
wipe your face .

right here , in front of me now , eat this .
yeah .
gee , thanks , pop .
here' s the thing .
i' m on a diet .
i read an article about these shrimps .
they' re not good for ya .
you know how many calories are in one of those shrimps ?
a lot .
it' s true .
it' s true and the other thing is , my sister had a baby and i took it over because she passed away and then the baby lost its legs and its arms and now it' s nothing but a stump but i still take care of it with my wife and it' s growing and it' s fairly happy , but it' s difficult ' cause i' ve been working a second shift at the factory to put food on the table , but all the love i see in that little guy' s face makes it worth it in the end .
true story .
i' m not askin ' you anymore .
i' m tellin ' you .

no .
have mercy .
pop , please ...
eat !
no eat .

oscar ?
no , it' s pinocchio .
of course it' s me .
why did you do that ?
i' m sorry .
no .
sorry " is when you step on somebody' s fin at the movies .
sorry " is when you say , " when' s the baby due ? " and it turns out the person' s just fat .
this is as far away from " sorry " as you could possibly get .
but , oscar , i think i' m gonna puke .
no , no .
lenny , just open up .
nice and easy .
are you not entertained ?
you can' t handle the truth .

why do you think she' s interested , huh ?
do you think for one minute that she' d even be with you if you weren' t the famous sharkslayer ?
please , don' t fight .
are you blind ?
she treats me like i' m somebody .
would she love you if you were nobody ?
nobody loved me as a nobody .
i did .
before the money , and before the fame .
before the lie .
to me you were a somebody , oscar .

a sham .
a con .
you' re a joke .

you mean that little bottom feeder from the whale wash ?
forget about her .
she' s a nobody .
no , i' m the nobody .
oh , let me guess .
she told you that she loves you .
is that it ?
it' s not like you feel the same way about her .
you know , i don' t think this is gonna work out .
wait , are you dumping me ?
let me explain something to you .
# we' re gonna party like it' s your birthday

how many times do i have to tell you ?
it' s " gosh .
you get a whale of a wash , and the price , oh , my gosh .

there' s a sit down in one hour .
who is it ?
shh !
be there , if you don' t wanna see her sleepin ' with the fishes .
the dead ones .
now , nod your head if you understand .
now , tell me if you nodded your head .
i nodded .
they got angie .
and they want a sit down .
i never meant for anybody to get hurt , especially not angie .
this is all my fault .
classic move .
i' ve seen it a thousand times .
they take the thing you love the most , and then they use it against you .
we gotta go to that sit down and we gotta save her .
whoa .
look , i wanna save angie , too , but i can' t waltz in and say , " hi , pop .
i' m a dolphin .
lenny ?
and the sharkslayer' s a fake .
fake ?
we' re gonna need a better plan than that .
this is a joke , right ?
because i told lino ...
shut up , lino .
shut up .
tell me that' s not lenny .
tell me you' re a real sharkslayer .
i' m sorry , sykes , i' m not .
but the sharks don' t know that .
will you stop screwin ' around ?
this' il never work .
we' re dead .
thank you , sykes .
thank you .
my man sykes just begged me not to murder lise all y' all up in here .
now , i might listen to him , but then again i might not .
and that depends on the individual behavior of all the individuals in here , individually .
ain' t that right ?
look , he' s got dolphin muscle .
my uncle vito got whacked by one of those .
now which one of you sardines called this meeting ?
that would be me .
so , this is the sharkslayer .
i' ve been lookin ' forward to meeting you .
i feel like we' re practically family .
you know that ?
funny , ain' t it ?
i brought my kids into the world , full of love and care , and you took them out .
you know who i am ?
do you know who i am ?
i' m the don .
the boss of the great white sharks .
hey , boss , i saved you a seat .
i' ve been runnin ' this reef since before you was born .

do you have any idea how this looks ?
this is the best sit down i' ve ever been to .
what are you doing with him ?

but , pop , listen ...
but nothing .
you never take sides against the family .
ever .
hey , don .
lino .
sir .
it' s not his fault .
this is between you and me .

it was an anchor that killed frankie .
i didn' t have anything to do with it , and neither did lenny .
if that was true , why did you run away ?
because you always wanted me to be like frankie .
i' il never be the shark you want me to be .
what is your problem ?
so your son likes kelp .
so his best friend is a fish .
so he likes to dress like a dolphin .
