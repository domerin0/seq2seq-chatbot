no talking in the ranks , karlberg !
let' s maintain proper behaviour in the ranks , boys .
you' re not allowed here . but i want to see you .
can i ask you something ? yes . will you come and watch tomorrow ? do you want me to ?
will you win ? lf you come i' il win .
do you have the guts ?
do you dare win ?
the winner of the 200 metre freestyle is erik ponti from class 3 : 5 .
so now there' s only the 300 metre freestyle left .
it' s between you and lewenheusen .
what are you doing to do ? what do you mean ? are you going for it ?
should i let lewenheusen win ?
more sportsmanlike not to enter the race !
this is not about being sportsmanlike .
haven' t you understood that ? this is stjrnsberg . hey , boys !
just thought i' d check that no one falls before the last hurdle .
we' ve got them !
be careful not to get disqualified at the start . everything has already been decided . for that very reason .
show them ! what' il happen if i win ? you' il be untouchable .
i promise .
it' s a matter of honour for me .
get set .
go .
the over all champion and holder of three new school records , erik ponti !
hello there ... l' m decorating the tree . l can see that .
i can see that you' re decorating the tree .
erik ...
my darling , welcome home .
i' ve missed you so much !
how is my little boy ?
you look so grown up . doesn' t he ?
but what the hell is he wearing ?
you look like a tram driver .
doesn' t he ?
you look lovely , really lovely .
look . but what happened to you there ? nothing .
here .
it' s wonderful .
we' il keep it here .
are you hungry ?
we' il be eating in a minute .
father has taken food back from the restaurant .
venison .
this is very good .
how many straight a' s have you got ?
but what the hell is all this ?
c for behaviour ?
how does our " stjrnsbergian " explain that ?
has it got something to do with all the weekend detentions ?
just think , you won the school championships in swimming .
but my dear , that' s not what we' re bloody talking about , is it ?
do you have an explanation ?
i didn' t want to be some errand boy for the sixth formers .
oh , i see .
what did you want to be then ? left in peace . what ?
left in peace .
ln peace ...
so you thought your mother should sell off her heirlooms  so you could be left in peace . ls that it ? no .
that' s not what you meant .
what then ?
i' m not understanding anything .
how many do you want , erik ?
thank you .
look how wonderful it looks .
pommes duchesse , marvellous .
erik , you know whenever there' s something i don' t understand  we have to have a talk after dinner .
that' s what we' il do .
but ... have some , darling , start .
haricots verts ... how delicious !
there we are ...
we' re friends again . friends again ...
marja !
marja !
hello , pierre . thanks for the record .
sounds good ! what' s this ? open .
lf you' re going to be a lawyer you' il need one of these .
not that it applies in this school , but nonetheless .
swedlsh law
it' s quite strange when you think about it .
school rules shouldn' t be above the law of the land , should they ? !
no , thanks .
you there !
what ? l haven' t done anything . don' t give me any lip .
come here .
no , i won' t . you' il have to stand in the corner . why ?
i haven' t done anything . come to the council at 19 . 00 .
understood ?
how did it go ?
what did they say ? three weekend detentions . why ?
i gave them lip , refused the pepperpot .
the next time : the ring !
no fun thumping a coward and an intellectual .
room search !
stand up straight , tanguy ! what the hell are you doing ? stand up straight , tanguy !
stand up straight , tanguy !
look at me !
good .
it looks like we have a bed wetter here .
be ready in an hour , tanguy !
don' t you understand what this is about ?
they' re trying to get at you .
they' ve just changed their tactics .
good day , sir !
good day , sir ! erik !
l' ve got an idea about the training . l' m not going to swim any more . what ?
you can' t do that . yes i can .
but ... you' re the best swimmer we' ve ever had .
you said i' d be untouchable .
that it was a matter of honour for you .
but there' s no honour here .
you know that .
there are many different ways of making life hell for people .
hello ! you' re not allowed to be here . don' t you want to talk to me ? of course i do , but it' s too risky . l don' t give a damn about them . l' m thinking about myself as well .
i don' t want to lose my job and you could be expelled .
wait .
i' m sorry , erik .
it' s not possible .
not now .
rat !
come up for an inspection .
rat ! ln here .
good that you could come , rat .
we need an independent witness .
fatty here is just about to admit he' s been smoking on the sly . no ! lf you hit him , you' il be expelled . that' s quite right .
paragraph 13 .
smoking indoors is also enough for immediate expulsion .
paragraph 7 .
who' s going to prove that ?
a rat and a pig ?
shit , dahln , it' s like a bloody zoo in here !
now about that confession .
it' s about time you stubbed out your cigarette for good .
here .
stub it out , you coward !
what ?
let' s see if it hurts as much as you think .
with your permission , in front of witnesses .
with any bloody permission you like .
you haven' t got the guts , have you ?
get dressed , tanguy !
present yourself in the ring tomorrow at 19 . 00 .
you know ...
none of this really needs to happen .
lf everyone just followed the rules .
everything would be easier .
that' s what rules are for .
why should your friend have to suffer  just because you think you are above everyone else .
you should give some thought to that .
come on .
silverhielm is cruel .
he' s an evil human being .
but why ?
was he born like that or has he been here too long , maybe beaten as well ...
that' s how the system works , isn' t it ?
kicked around in the lower form ?
revenge later on ...
that' s why it just continues .
does it hurt ?
i just know that people like silverhielm have to be fought .
someone like him must never win .
not now or ever .
that' s it !
have you seen pierre ? no . have you seen pierre ? no . have you seen pierre ? ! not since the maths class .
ls it true he' s been called to the ring tonight ?
you don' t have to do it .
it doesn' t matter what you say .
i' ve already decided .
l' m going to do it . why ?
otherwise it' il just carry on . lf i do it now , maybe they' il leave me alone .
wasn' t that what you said yourself ?
might as well get it out of the way .
but you' re not like me , pierre .
i can fight .
not a bit , more than you can imagine !
i' ve been fighting my whole life , and once you' ve done that it never ends .
but help me then .
show me !
teach me how to fight . you can' t learn to fight . why ?
am i too weak ?
it' s not about that .
it' s completely different .
something in your head .
let' s forget it .
i' il take the pepperpot and i' il clean their bloody shoes .
you don' t seem to understand .
it' s too late .
how is it going to help , you getting beaten up ?
how do you know i will ?
get beaten up ...
you' re not the only one who can fight .
people like silverhielm must disappear . who said that ? l wish i could take your place .
what ?
why ?
do you think you' re better than me ?
maybe silverhielm was right .
you like putting yourself above the rest of us .
because you keep quiet when they burn you with a cigarette .
that' s sick !
so what do you want me to do ?
it doesn' t matter what you say .
i' m going into the ring anyway .
okay , be an idiot then !
flght , flght , flght !
pierre tanguy , come and get your punishment !
come on , tanguy !
come on , little piggy !
tanguy , tanguy , tanguy !
will you do as you' re told from now on , or carry on being cheeky ?
do you promise to do as you' re told ? no , you coward , you bloody swine ! what did you call me ? a swine !
a stinking swine ! can we hear that again ? " shittyhielm !
one more time ?
shittyhielm !
on your knees !
get down on your knees !
never !
what' s the time ? almost 9 . have you had any sleep ? yes , a bit .
you got in a good punch there .
have you been practising on the quiet ?
no .
i just lashed out , sort of .
don' t worry .
i' il have a word with silverhielm .
this is going to stop .
i have to go to my house arrest now .
see you tonight .
will you be okay ?
erik ...
see you later .
yes , see you later .
rat !
one of the boys in 2 : 5 is sick , so you must do his punishment duties . but i have to go up to house arrest . don' t give me lip !
here ...
these have to be put into the ground in a 2x2 metre square .
firm as a rock ! then you can go to your arrest . yes .
good .
get to work !
a thousand and one nlghts
you can go and have some food now .
no .
let me go !
let me go !
i hope you put the stakes in properly .
we' il take your dick last of all .
how does it feel , then ?
are you scared ?
i' m never going to be scared of you , " shittyhielm .
start with the warm water .
pour it on !
le' ts boll rat !
boll rat !
pour it on !
pour it ! l don' t want to !
looks like you need cooling down , rat ! cold water !
let him stay there .
we can' t leave him there .
he' il freeze to death .
you shut up !
are you cold ? yes , a little .
dear erik , by the time you read this letter , i' il have left stjrnsberg .
don' t think i' m a coward .
i tried to hold out for as long as i could .
there is so much i want to say , but the taxi is coming in a minute .
anyway , i want you to know that you' re the best friend i' ve ever had .
lf you like you can write to me at my mother' s address in stockholm .
your affectionate friend , pierre .
ps .
i didn' t have space for my works of strindberg and the gramophone .
please make full use of them .
come in !
hello , erik . hello .
am i disturbing ? no .
you' ve been lying here for four days .
shouldn' t i ask matron to look at you ?
no .
i feel much better .
the rumours are flying .
i' ve heard that ... ... silverhielm went over the top this time .
what exactly happened ?
nothing .
very sad about pierre .
it really is .
what kind of freaks are you ?
don' t you understand what you' ve done ?
pierre was one of the most gifted students we' ve ever had here .
you and he were close friends , erik .
couldn' t you have defended him ?
why didn' t you defend him ?
at least give me an answer !
why didn' t you defend him ?
are you as cowardly as the others ?
you get expelled if you fight with a council member .
the thing that separates humans from animals  is not only intelligence , it' s also morality .
the ability to know the difference between good and evil .
you have all behaved like animals .
like vultures .
it' s undignified !
do you hear me ?
undignified !
this has to stop .
i don' t think sir understands exactly what' s happened here .
that' il be all for today .
thank you .
the ring in one hour .
bring von schenken with you .
after much deliberation , rat has decided to accept the challenge .
teach him a lesson in the true spirit of stjrnsberg .
you may start .
i' ve got a question .
do i have to hit both or is it enough if one crawls out ?
it' s over once you crawl out , or ... if both punisment prefects crawl out .
good .
just one more question .
can i hit them as much as i like ? fight ! l was thinking about you , dahln .
i thought i might break your nose . and you !
left or right handed ?
right handed .
very well .
i' il break your left arm at the elbow .
don' t talk so bloody much , rat !
we said the nose , didn' t we ?
crawl !
you too .
crawl !
crawl !
hello .
i' d like to talk to marja .
can you ask her to come out ?
marja doesn' t work here any more . what ?
she got fired .
three days ago .
they had no proof , but apparently they didn' t need any .
what do you mean , fired ?
for what ?
you should know .
... and because linn called this groupe cryptogams  with crypto indicating " hidden " or " obscured " .
this gives us " hidden wedding " or " hidden fertilization " .
erik ... erik ! yes ? are you alright ? l' m fine .
and then we have the other group , phanerogams ...
von leiven .
vinberg .
ponti .
ponti has a letter from finland .
room search !
i found it !
this is even better than i thought .
don' t worry about me getting with child with you .
that prostitute can' t even put it in proper swedish ! " with child with you !
i had my diaphragm on . " the stopper on her head , not in her cunt ? !
eh ?
i' m sorry it all went so wrong .
but i suppose it' s both of our fault .
maybe it' s true i love you , but not that i think we' il meet again .
i don' t think so either !
you' ve fucked the kitchen whore !
when the headmaster sees this you' il be expelled straight away !
stretch your legs a bit !
and now sit down , gentlemen . not you , ponti !
go to the headmaster straight away !
take your things !
gentlemen !
it' s november , the 6th of november to be precise , 1632 , ltzen .
dense fog before us .
come in .
lf i understand things right , you' ve been having long term problems ... ... finding your feet at stjrnsberg .
ls that right ?
well , the school rules are very clear on these matters .
i have no alternative but to expel you without matriculating from your year .
i would prefer to have you off school premises  shall we say by 1 5 . 00 tomorrow .
it' s my duty to inform your parents  but i assume you' d prefer to have a word with them first .
the letter , may i have it back ?
what are you going to do with it ? her address .
i' d like to write to her .
the best thing you can do know is to forget about that girl .
when you read this i have left ...
l tried for as long as i could ...
one thing i want you to know ...
best friend i ever had .
maybe it' s true i love you , but not that i think we' il meet again .
stop !
only members of this school are allowed to eat here .
hello ?
who is it ?
erik , hello ?
erik , is it you ?
it' s just the two of us now , silverhielm .
it' s 2 kilometres to the stable and even further to the school .
you could make a run for it .
you' re fairly quick .
lf you go now , it' il take me 100 metres to catch up with you . what the hell are you talking about ? down on your knees ! you' re bloody mad . l said , down on your knees !
what do you want ?
money ?
i' il give you 10 000 .
my word ! 1 0 000 ? ! ls that all you' re worth ? l' il give it to you tomorrow . l swear on my honour as a nobleman . your honour as a nobleman ?
where was that when you tortured pierre ?
and when you struck me ?
you did everything to provoke me .
don' t you understand the living hell i had to endure with you ?
that ring , give it here !
it' s the sort of thing they use to identify a rotten old corpse .
and the teeth , of course .
you won' t enjoy having all your teeth out , but you won' t feel a thing ...
are you mad ?
they' il give you a life sentence in prison .
i' ve thought everything through .
no proof once i' ve burnt your clothes !
only pierre and marja will know about it .
i won' t tell anyone else .
did you really think i was going to kill you ?
i' m not like you , silverhielm .
i' m not like you .
gunnar ekengren lawyer
three cheers ...
dear colleagues ...
i' m extremely moved by all this kindness .
and i' d very much like to say on behalf of my wife and myself ...
i think we have a visitor .
ponti ?
still here ?
i thought we had concluded any remaining business . lt was the thing about the letter . maybe i didn' t make myself clear .
some things have not been acceptable in the sense of existing legislation ... what are you talking about ? my right to privacy was violated .
lf you keep the letter , it' s a criminal act according to swedish law .
what are you trying to say ?
leave the school premises immediately ! do you hear ? excuse me if i' m interrupting things . who are you ? this is my lawyer .
the name is ekengren .
good day to you , gentlemen .
well , this is a rather sorry tale for everyone involved , you might say .
i' ve just had a long telephone call with a good friend , a reporter .
who happens to work for this newspaper .
he was very interested to hear about erik' s story .
ln fact he' d like to come and write a reportage on this school .
and perhaps flesh out erik' s story a bit more .
however , you may not feel this sort of publicity will be of benefit ...
i' m rather busy at the moment .
perhaps we could ...
the legal implications are already clearly set out here .
i don' t know what you think , erik ?
could we possibly avoid making this a police matter ? maybe . excuse me , what is all this about ?
lf all the information has not been squarely placed in front of me , then ...
surely headmaster has access to all the information ?
as i say , if there are certain circumstances  to which i have not been alerted  then naturally i would like to be told of them .
lf you' il all excuse me .
have some cake in the meantime ! alma ...
the letter ...
may i have it back ?
thanks .
behave for the rest of the term and get in touch when you come back .
it' s not my hope but rather my conviction  that you' il go into life bearing something  that we proudly call the stjrnsberg spirit .
good luck !
now it all begins .
good luck !
erik , if you see pierre give him my regards .
erik , take care of yourself .
with these reports you' il get into any sixth form college you like .
but a d in general behaviour !
ls that heading in the right direction ?
i mean , before you had a c.
and now you have a d.
what' s your explanation ?
ls it that finnish whore ?
we' ve heard all about it .
she was a waitress , just like you .
we' il talk this over after dinner .
what' s the matter with you ?
what are you staring at ?
what the hell are you staring at ?
what are you staring at ?
you' re coming with me !
erik !
i' m sorry .
let' s get this out of the way . please ! what' s going on here ? now listen to me !
it' s over .
you' re getting out of here .
ln half an hour you' re going to be in hospital .
you won' t see , your nose will be snapped , your arms will be broken .
you won' t dare tell anyone .
you' il say that you fell down the stairs .
lf you get the police involved , they' il find out what you' ve been doing to us .
this is going to hurt a hell of a lot .
you' il be screaming until you pass out .
i swear i' m really going to do it .
people like you have to be destroyed .
this is the last time , then never again .
i thought you' d be in savolaks by now . where are you going ? to geneva .
another school .
business . l thought you wanted to write . many things one wants to do !
you ?
i' ve got a job in a legal firm over the summer .
as a messenger boy . l have to pay for my private tuition . forget that .
we' re friends . lt makes no difference to me . because you' re rich .
l' il be seeing you , erik . l' il be seeing you , pierre .
