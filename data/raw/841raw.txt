it' s a big claim .
cops want to nail the guy who stole it too .
we have to pay out $30, 000 .
to them , it' s another heist .
has the owner stashed it someplace ?
ls she trying to defraud us out of a lot of money ?
lf you have a large sums of cash in the house , we insist on certain alarm and security alarms which my supervisor has to approve .
but what we usually do is handle the installation ourselves .
sweetheart , can i get you ?
john , do you have a minute ?
i haven' t had lunch .
what do you want ?
cherry cheesecake , prune danish and some hershey bars .
and something sweet .
some chocolate covered raisins .
i found the missing picasso .
i don' t believe it .
galaxie opticals .
they rolled it up , it' s in a telescope .
how' d you figure it out ?
it wasn' t easy .
i was looking for a picture of a woman with a guitar , but it' s all little cubes .
took me two hours to find the nose .
better call the cops .
right away .
would you excuse me ?
rosie , get me the fingerprints on the leland claim .
who won the 6th at aqueduct ?
your horse came in 7th ..
never bet on a horse with parkinson' s .
congratulations .
i heard you recovered the picasso .
yeah , congrats .
it was a breeze .
here' s something till your order arrives .
you want to be my date tonight ?
what ' tonight ?
george' s birthday .
we' re taking george out .
sure .
but you have to get me home and in bed by midnight .
that' s exactly what i was planning .
that girl has a body that won' t quit .
it won' t stop 5 minutes for a coffee break .
briggsie , i forgot to tell you ...
where are my ...
rosie !
where are my files ?
where are my files ?
moved .
they moved the files ?
why ?
streamlining .
this is fitzgerald ?
who else ?
did you take the files out of my office ?
can you come in like a human being ?
did you move my files ?
or like an orangutan .
that would be a step up , too .
put them back now .
this instant .
you knew about the move .
take my files and put them back in my office now .
you had time to move them yourself ?
lf you were a man , i' d slam you in the teeth .
lf i were a man , you' d be hiding under the desk .
i gave you an order .
an order ?
who you think i am some peroxide stenographer with brains in her sweater who rear you pinch ?
pinch ?
i couldn' t get my arms around it .
i work for magruder , not you .
we' re turning this place around .
i' ve been working here twenty years .
you' re here six months .
i' m not interested in your ideas .
get my files and put them back now .
or what ?
or what ?
this is the question you ask me ?
or what ?
are you saying , " or what ? " to me ?
get off my toe , or you' il sing castrati with a glee club .
i hated you from the day you set foot in this office .
you hate any woman who doesn' t have a double digit l . q.
i' m a good judge of character .
i hate you and the chancellor of germany with the moustache but not in that order .
don' t let the door hit your back and fracture the your pelvis .
you tell her who' s boss ?
how can she talk to me like that ?
she thinks she' s smarter because she graduate from vassar and i went to driving school .
does she know how many cases i cracked ?
never trust a woman who whistles for her own cabs .
miss fitzgerald ?
ls that miss fitzgerald' s lunch ?
sorry it' s so late .
no problem .
here , keep that .
this is fitzgerald' s lunch .
i' il deliver it to her .
you got to come to some terms with her .
we don' t need an efficiency expert .
the old man wouldn' t have got one .
you were going to take her for a drink to clear the air .
i did .
i took her two weeks ago to rocky' s bar .
you and her at rocky' s bar ?
sorry i' m late .
no problem .
it' s just and hour and fifteen .
my meeting ran long .
no , i understand .
we' re getting rid of that antiquated filing system .
i can find anything i need .
i got a feel for where all the stuff is in my office .
a central data file will be on the 2nd floor .
you' il get used to it .
what' s wrong ?
you look flushed .
i' m just a little warm , that' s all .
you have all your business meetings here ?
it' s near the office .
coat check girl' s pretty .
you don' t like it ?
it' s fine .
it gives new meaning to the word " dive " but it it' s convenient .
i thought you' d like the thick smoke .
you don' t need as much make up .
what' s the lady is having ?
tequila .
so , ...
betty ...
betty ann ...
can i call you ... ?
i can call you miss fitzgerald .
i have no problem with that .
l , ... tell me about yourself .
myself ?
your hopes , your dreams .
are you married ?
obviously not or it wouldn' t be " miss fitzgerald " .
do you have a boyfriend ?
ls this why you got me here ?
i just , ...
what' s your life like ?
do you have any hobbies ?
i have a meeting in 1 5 minutes , so ...
your marital status is none of my business .
maybe it' s a touchy point with you .
you' re possibly divorced or widowed .
maybe your husband committed suicide .
i could understand that .
mr. magruder hired me to streamline the office .
i' m going to .
but if something' s not broken , i say , why fix it ?
there' s a reason north coast has slipped from the top five .
there' s enormous waste and duplication .
not in my department .
any department can be run more efficiently and economically .
perhaps north coast should eliminate the investigative division and farm out cases privately .
would it be possible to have a drink and discuss that ?
we are having a drink .
you don' t know what you' re saying .
you came in here like a steamroller .
you felt threatened by me the day i started .
i was i a challenge to your little state within a state ... and i' m not some wind up doll to tickle at the cooler .
i' m smarter than you .
i' m faster .
i see right through you .
you' re right to feel threatened .
i am threatened by you ?
it' s fascinating how many men i meet with a fragile masculinity .
fragile masculinity ?
one more crack about my religion and i' il ...
i have to go .
honey , let me level with you .
despite all your highfalutin ' talk about streamlining what you really need is a good roll in the hay .
you wouldn' t know which end is up .
ln your case , it would be hard to tell .
don' t see me out .
someone may think we' re together .
do i look like an organ grinder ?
no .
just an organ .
get used to her .
she' s here to stay .
there' s something about her i don' t trust .
she' s evil .
we have a reservation at the rainbow room for george' s 50th .
that' il be fun .
i don' t have time to go home to change .
does look okay ?
no matter how bad the economy gets , you' il never starve .
good .
wait .
miss fitzgerald ?
okay , take a card .
you got to see this , fitz .
that' s the six of hearts .
that' s amazing !
how' d you do that ?
magic .
he could do it all afternoon .
i want you to teach me one of those tricks .
mr. magruder , the report will be done tomorrow .
you coming to george' s birthday celebration ?
no .
i' m up to my neck in work .
it' il be fun .
george is a great guy .
everyone here' s nice .
only briggs gives me the dry heaves .
c. w ?
he' s cracked a lot of cases .
i don' t see how .
such a drone .
gets his tips from street contacts , like ex cons and blind beggars .
there' s something about him i don' t trust .
any examples ?
many .
he' s smarmy , with those wisecracks and double meaning jokes .
i mean , who is he , really ?
a shallow , skirt chasing egomaniac who' s probably more lucky than good .
sometimes it' s better to be lucky .
you' re being too rough on him .
he' s just an insecure schnook .
he has no wife or family .
he was married .
short and stormy .
picked a tramp .
that' s a surprise .
come tonight .
we' il get to be together .
it' s the perfect excuse , an employee' s birthday
how much longer will this go on ?
not much longer .
i' il be free by the end of year .
you love me , but spend all the important holidays with her .
life can get so complicated when you think it' s simple .
come tonight .
so we can eye each other and play little games in code ?
yes .
that' s part of the romance .
we' il look back and know that ... when one of us brought up paris , it meant ... we are dying to make love .
you are such adolescent .
but cute ?
look at this .
here' s to george bond , insurance man , father .
amateur magician .
george , no card tricks tonight .
happy fiftieth , george .
everyone , i' d like to make a toast to c. w. briggs .
thanks to you , the police now have the stolen picasso .
what made you think of looking in the telescope ?
what i do is put myself in the criminal' s position .
i try to anticipate what he' il do next .
i think like him .
fantastic .
i would hate to have me after me .
what are you thinking , mr. magruder ?
you look lost in reverie .
sorry .
i was just reading about the germans occupying paris .
doesn' t look good .
c. w. , ever been to paris ?
i' ve never been out of the country .
six zero dash six ... eight dash five ... eight five seven .
that' s right .
that' s exactly correct .
and now for something i call " the power of jade scorpion " .
for this , i' il need some victims , i mean , volunteers from the audience .
a few nice people .
miss , would you ?
sir ?
here' s another one !
there' s a sucker born every minute !
represent us well , briggs !
many years ago ... an emperor in china received as a gift this precious pendant .
a jade scorpion .
it was said to possess extraordinary powers to darken men' s minds .
i can' t get hypnotized .
i' m a bad subject .
eyes only on the scorpion , please .
ears open ... to the sound of my voice .
look at the scorpion .
the surrender of the mind .
the surrender of the mind .
they resist and resist .
but the scorpion likes resistance .
what is your name , sir ?
c. w. briggs .
and what do you do , mr. briggs ?
i' m an insurance investigator for north coast casualty and fidelity of new york .
what is your name , miss ?
betty ann fitzgerald .
i also work at north coast .
so you work together ?
i can' t stand her .
don' t pay attention to him .
he' s a sleazy megalomaniac who' s frightened of women .
enough .
sleep .
silence .
the jade scorpion wants you to go to the deepest level .
when i say " constantinople " , you' il drop into the deepest trance .
all resistance will disappear .
when i say " madagascar " , you will go to the deepest level of hypnotic sleep .
you will obey all my orders .
ready .
constantinople .
madagascar .
c. w. briggs ,
miss betty ann fitzgerald , i now pronounce you man and wife .
when i snap my fingers you' il awaken , not knowing you' re in a trance .
you will be madly in love with each other .
you' re on your honeymoon on a desert island .
maestro ?
the moon shines down its magical glow on you two honeymooners .
you' re deeply in love .
ready ?
one , two , three .
awaken to your tropical paradise .
what are you thinking ?
i' m thinking
i' m the luckiest man in the world to have you .
i' m the lucky one , c. w.
i was in love with you the first moment i saw you .
make love to me here under the stars , to the sound of the ocean .
miss fitzgerald .
you' re making a mistake .
i' m not longer miss fitzgerald .
i' m mrs. c. w. briggs .
betty ann !
make love here to me here .
now .
stop .
enough .
unfortunately , every dream must turn to reality .
when i snap my fingers , you' il awaken with no memory of this event .
you' il return to your regular lives , with whatever destinies await you .
i hope they are pleasant ones .
ready ?
on the snap of my fingers .
one , you' re beginning to come up .
two , the memory is fading completely .
three , the jade scorpion has created the miracle of love .
and four , awaken .
how do you feel ?
waiting for something to happen .
how do you feel ?
i' m not very good subject .
me , neither .
i told you wouldn' t work .
well , i tried my best .
george , back me .
you gazed into her eyes and said you loved her .
you' re crazy .
never .
it' s a conspiracy to make me look crazy .
i hope someone talks to me like that someday .
i can' t bear fitzgerald .
speaking of that shouldn' t we be getting home to feed your cat ?
i' m getting a cold .
i want to go to bed with some tea .
lf you got a cold , someone has to rub your chest with vicks .
anyone rubs my chest , better bring a ring .
good for you .
good night , baby .
i knew we' d get some time alone if you came .
i' m glad i came .
hello ?
constantinople .
you are in a deep trance .
you will fall deeper under the sway of my words .
you will obey my instructions carefully .
you will go to the kensington estate , where you will obtain all the jewels from the safe .
with the utmost secrecy , you will use all the information and techniques at your command .
you will do it with ease and facility .
then you will return to your apartment , with the jewels .
you' il hide them in a safe and secure hiding place , awaiting further instructions from me .
you' il then fall into a deep slumber and awake refreshed without no memory of what has occurred .
you will wait to hear from me .
your life will be as your life is , until you hear from me .
obey my instructions to the letter .
you' il remember nothing that occurred under trance . ls that clear to you ?
very clear .
go . the jade scorpion commands it .
awful late , mr. briggs .
hot on a case ?
the kensington safe was broken into .
jewels worth millions , all gone .
cops haven' t a clue .
magruder is numb .
i don' t understand , i burglar proofed that placed myself .
tell that to the perpetrator .
we' re on the hook for big money , so get over there fast .
those stones could be on the market in tangier or cairo .
everything , my emerald tiara , my sapphire necklace from lndia .
that sapphire is the most perfect in the world .
no fingerprints , but a partial shoe print .
man or woman ?
i can' t be sure .
i want to interview everybody , butlers , gardeners , everybody .
i think your gut reaction is betraying you , c. w.
nobody in this house is involved .
i' d bet my life .
i want to search .
can i go upstairs ?
lf you must , be fast .
we' ve had enough excitement for one day .
mrs. kensington ?
you know alfie and i would never ...
lotte , of course not .
what are you doing in my mother' s closet ?
well , hello .
you' re one of those grubby private detectives , aren' t you ?
a private eye , they' re called .
a shamus .
a gumshoe .
no , i' m a grubby insurance investigator .
private eyes are romantic .
i' m just grubby .
you always get your kicks fondling women' s shoes ?
no , once in a while i' il fondle a whole woman .
you have a fresh mouth .
i' m not sure i like you .
i grow on people .
we could meet later , and i could grow on you .
you don' t seem tough enough to go after criminals .
maybe if i slap you around , you' il change your mind .
i could slap you back .
this is starting to sound like fun .
shall we put some music on ?
why are you snooping around ?
you' re laura kensington , right ?
that' s right .
and i have a strawberry mark on my thigh to prove it .
want to see ?
maybe later , when i can take the full tour .
my fianc might not appreciate that .
which one ?
so you follow my life .
i read the tabloids .
you' ve seen photos of me diving into a public fountain .
and getting arrested for speeding and throwing champagne at el morocco .
while i live the fast life , you snoop in people' s closets .
can i help it if i' m paid by the clue ?
did the burglar leave any ?
no .
because he' s still among us .
says who ?
the little man who lives inside me .
so you' re c. w. briggs .
i hear you' re a sharp investigator with an impressive record .
i looked forward to meeting you .
they say i always get my man .
me , too .
right .
i' m glad we could have this chat .
too bad the house is full of people .
where shall we go tonight ?
chinatown or harlem ?
you prefer jazz or opium ?
i prefer the rug in front of my fireplace .
directly to your apartment ?
you always begin with the dessert ?
it depends what i' m eating .
this will be an interesting experiment .
i usually prefer more attractive , athletic , muscular men .
maybe i could do a few push ups before you came over .
what about your fianc ?
lf you don' t invite him , i won' t .
any leads ?
it' s an inside job .
no question .
that' s not what the cops say .
they' re wrong .
the giants playing this afternoon ?
they' re playing the cardinals , in st. louis .
call my bookmaker .
make a bet for me 1 00 dollars on the giants .
the giant to win ?
naturally .
what do you think , to place ?
mr. magruder ?
tilt .
the kensington situation ?
lnside job , i' d bet my life on it .
you bet your life on the giants , and they' re in 6th place .
can we talk without the warden .
miss fitzgerald is part of the company .
we must work together in harmony .
why do you think it' s an inside job ?
only an inside job would be that smooth .
miss fitzgerald suggests expanding our investigation .
meaning what ?
i appreciate the value of intuition .
but we' re moving into a decade of scientific innovation .
miss fitzgerald suggested we might get you some help by farming out some work to an outside detective agency .
see if a new approach , fresh techniques make a difference .
don' t be threatened immediately .
you said i' m only threatened by women with high lqs .
north coast has to keep up with the marketplace .
there' s a lot of money at stake .
the trail' s growing cold .
lf coopersmith detective agency contributes , fine .
lf not , we' re only out a few bucks .
the coopersmiths are like fric and frac .
they' re submental .
we' re moving into a new decade , the 1 940s .
things are different .
max baer needs a sparring partner .
you' re the only person giving me this kind of resistance .
you' re a dinosaur , with your street ways and disorganized methods .
please .
my father always stressed harmony .
i' ve got to go .
i' m working on a case .
we' il have lunch .
i know a restaurant you' il love .
gestapo food .
don' t get hit by a bus , your body mangled beyond recognition .
i ain' t heard a word about any job .
nobody tried to fence anything or do any bragging .
charlie , you' ve got to help me with this .
keep your ears open .
anything you hear , i got to know .
it' s very important to me .
50 ?
you must be desperate .
you know where to reach me .
keep eating carrots .
they' re working .
i think they' re gone up there , mr. briggs .
i just have to check something .
i' il be right down .
you startled me .
i was working late .
eddie said he didn' t think anyone was up here .
well , i' m here .
obviously , i' m here .
why are you so nervous ?
i' m not nervous .
why would i be nervous ?
i' m working alone .
i didn' t expect to see you .
don' t you always work late ?
that' s what i hear .
ls this twenty questions ?
you scared me .
i' m alone , filling out reports .
asking magruder to remove the water coolers ?
make wisecracks somewhere else .
i' m busy .
don' t work too late .
the bags under your eyes are getting bigger .
good night .
and if you have a sudden coronary thrombosis , go straight to the hospital .
you were right .
we shouldn' t fool around at the office .
he gives me the willies .
he' s harmless .
how did you get in ?
it wasn' t hard .
you had your father buy the building ?
a small tip to the super was all it took .
for you , maybe .
i give the super a small tip , he spits on my shoes .
i brought some very expensive russian vodka , 1 20 proof .
don' t drop that .
you' il blow up the building .
there' s nothing to read but detective magazines and the racing form .
no , i have a deck of cards with naked women on them .
let me guess , you use it to play solitaire ?
i used to date the six of spades .
i love where you live .
it' s just what i thought , a grimy , little rathole .
i' il tell my decorator .
it' s the effect we were going for .
you dying to see my strawberry mark ?
lf it' s in the same spot it was this afternoon .
this is a novelty for me .
i' m used to penthouses and yachts , gorgeous european lovers who ... sweep me off my feet .
yet , i find it strangely exciting standing here in a grungy hovel with a myopic insurance clerk
there' s a compliment in there somewhere i just don' t know where .
you taking that coat off ?
it hasn' t rained in here in 20 years .
what do you think ?
lf i happen to pass away while we' re doing anything , have the embalmer leave the smile on my face .
perfect timing .
i' il slip into something more comfortable and wait in bed .
more comfortable ?
are you going to put on jergens lotion ?
constantinople .
you are in the power of the jade scorpion .
you will proceed to the dillworth mansion .
you will enter and open the safe .
ever heard of an lndian book called the kama sutra ?
i' m sorry , but we have to postpone our little rendezvous .
pardon me ?
i just recalled a prior engagement .
i hope you don' t mind .
the doorman will get you a taxi .
i had a wonderful evening .
thank you .
you' re joking .
i' il turn around so you can get dressed .
please hurry .
i' m rather pressed for time .
have you got a loose screw ?
tonight was very meaningful to me .
i' il think of it in a cherished way .
lf you' re in the neighborhood again , drop in .
what' s come over you ?
should you want a snack for the way back home ,
i have a dish of peanuts in the other room .
you hate women , don' t you ?
not at all .
they' re a splendid gender .
really .
a very pleasant variation .
i should have known .
a mousy , little clerk like you , chasing criminals your entire life .
laura , don' t be cross .
drop in again in the spring .
the oleander will be in bloom .
i' m going .
i' m getting out .
i' m not used to getting kicked out of a man' s bed .
you' re very sick .
thanking you in advance for understanding .
god bless you .
you have splendidly shaped buttocks .
i can' t believe it .
it' s identical .
think someone from the kensington house pulled this one , too ?
we did the security here .
we made the place foolproof .
someone' s a step ahead of you .
i want to speak to the dillworths .
the coopersmith detectives are grilling them .
i can' t believe it !
she convinced magruder to hire the coopersmiths .
we need all the help we can get on this case .
you want to talk to me , fellas ?
we' re in on this now , c. w.
this is my case , just so you know .
like we horned in .
hey , they called us .
that was their first mistake .
maybe they think you' re slipping .
you know my brother joe ?
the one who died at birth ?
i hear you' re having trouble .
you guys got any clues ?
a few .
want to share them with me ?
i' il let you know if they' re real clues or a laundry list .
lf we make a collar , it' il mean a long term deal with north coast .
i hear they' re making changes up there .
i' m going to make this bust them you' il be back at your old jobs finding lost poodles .
we laughed when we heard you said the kensington' s was an inside job .
i can see we' il be tripping all over each other .
one of us is going to fall down .
we don' t plan on falling .
you' re in over your heads .
this is a very smart burglar and you can' t figure it out if you get a confession .
we figure we' re looking for a tall man , heavy set , athletic , about thirty years old .
belly button in or out ?
lf he' s short , he' s too fat to squeeze through the kitchen window .
show him the big clue .
did the guy leave behind his birth certificate ?
show him .
no one in this house was ever to rocky' s bar .
i' ve been to rocky' s bar .
big deal .
6 million people eat there .
we' re gonna nail this guy .
the important thing is , don' t think of us as competition .
don' t worry .
i don' t .
why are you upset ?
we' il get him .
can you believe she talked magruder into hiring those jerks ?
you' ve been moping all day .
what' s going on ?
i have a confession to make .
i woke up this morning and found this on the floor of my apartment .
so ?
i have no memory of being with anybody last night .
that happens to everybody .
you pick up a broad , get drunk .
you didn' t remember .
there was an empty bottle of vodka on the floor .
i don' t drink vodka .
that' s why you blacked out .
vodka does funny things to a person .
i' ve gotten up with some strange looking heads under my arm .
no , there' s something wrong , al .
i came back here .
i wanted to check something in my office .
i remember that .
this was about nine o' clock .
wait a minute .
i ran in .
wait a minute .
what ?
of course .
no wonder i thought it was an inside job .
but not inside the dillworths ' or the kensingtons ' .
it' s inside our company .
it' s obvious .
why didn' t i see it right away ?
only mize , bond and me have access to your security set ups .
and what if someone else was given access ?
someone we don' t know as well because she hasn' t worked here as long as we have ?
fitzgerald ?
why not ?
why not ?
we' ve had female jewel thieves before .
she always saying she can do anything a man can do .
i doubt she meant stealing .
what do we know about her ?
nothing .
she has expensive tastes .
she wears good jewelry .
i got to get into her office .
don' t .
i must .
lf you get caught , she' il take a gun a shoot you .
she goes duck hunting .
it makes perfect sense .
she' s here late every night .
we' ve given her the files .
she knows the security information .
i got to search her place .
don' t rifle her desk .
you' il get caught .
what are you doing ?
me ?
you' re going through my desk .
i beg your complete pardon .
you were snooping in my papers .
only a suspicious , paranoid mind would say something like that .
i doubt amish people or quakers would come to that conclusion .
you wormy little ferret .
now you' re mixing metaphors .
i know why you' re snooping .
i wasn' t snooping .
to find the coopersmiths ' report .
you hired them to give me a hard time .
it' s too many cooks , we' re all over each other .
they made more progress in a few hours than you have in 2 days .
were you crying ?
your mascara .
don' t tap dance out of getting caught searching my desk .
i wasn' t searching .
i was rummaging .
get out . lf i catch you going through my stuff again ...
what are you afraid i' il find ?
you can' t find your nose in the dark .
watch out .
i' m onto you .
i know what you are .
this is silly .
we should both calm down .
you could have a stroke killing you instantly or paralyzing half your body .
she hit the ceiling when she caught me before .
because she' s guilty .
look behind her eyes .
she' s bad .
she has pretty eyes .
i said look behind the eyes .
there' s something wrong .
the minute i met her , i sensed trouble .
lf you two were boxers , we could get a millions dollar gate .
i got to get into her place .
being an investigator doesn' t put you above the law .
she could get you locked up .
that ever stopped me before ?
she' s out tonight .
how do you know ?
i went through her appointments .
she' s meeting her sister for dinner .
she said her sister' s an invalid in detroit .
see ?
nothing she says ever checks out .
you can' t break into her apartment .
it' s unethical .
i won' t break in .
i got the key .
how' d you get that ?
stole it from her purse .
what happens when she finds it missing ?
she won' t .
i copied it and put the original back .
you' ve a touch of larceny in you .
you' d have made a great thief .
it takes one to catch one , don' t forget that .
see you .
can i take your coat , honey ?
what did you want to tell me ?
no drink ?
how much alcohol do you need to be completely honest ?
you' re not making this easy .
why should l ?
because we care about each other .
before you loved me .
now you care for me ?
betty ann , sit down .
i won' t faint .
i' ve been dumped .
don' t say things like that .
you got me out of the restaurant because you were afraid
i' d make a scene or pass out .
you are a volatile woman .
am l ?
most men complain i' m cool as ice .
i care about you .
you said that .
i want to leave caroline .
but you' re not .
i' ve tried to find the courage a hundred times .
all those promises ?
stories about how miserable you were at home ?
you' re making this into a nightmare .
lsn' t it ?
try to understand .
we can still be friends .
we can even continue to sleep together .
are you nuts ?
i only got involved because you told me your marriage was on its last legs .
sounds like i deceived you .
haven' t you ?
i didn' t mean to .
i respect you too much .
we went from " love " to you " care for " to you " respect " me .
soon you' il be buying me a prayer shawl .
leave me alone .
okay ?
just go .
i' il be fine .
honey , listen .
leave me alone !
i hope you stay at north coast .
you' re turning our company around .
guess we won' t be honeymooning in positano .
i feel like such a jerk !
don' t .
i got into this against my better judgment .
oh , honey .
just go .
goodbye , chris .
goodbye , new york .
miss fitzgerald !
what are you doing ?
what are you doing here ?
what do you mean ?
what are you doing here ?
i was passing through .
i was hiding behind your screen .
behind what ?
that nice japanese screen .
i was hiding behind it .
how did you get in ?
how long have you been here ?
quite a while , actually .
you broke into my apartment ?
no .
how did you get in ?
you want to know ?
how did you get in ?
i made a copy of your key .
you what ?
you can have it for no charge .
it' s good to have two keys .
why did you do this ?
i' m convinced that someone at north coast is responsible for the jewel robbery .
who , me ?
you' re a prime suspect , yes .
based on what ?
i know everyone better than you and you have access to the data .
so do you .
but you were so nervous the other night .
you acted strange and you have a rocky' s matchbook .
remember we had a drink at rocky' s ?
it didn' t go too well .
so you broke into my apartment and spied on me ?
i wasn' t spying .
i' m a big rummager .
you what ?
i was rummaging and the afternoon and saw " dinner with my sister " .
all those dinners with your sister were magruder , right ?
god , i' m mortified !
lf not for me , they' d be scraping you up with spoon .
that' s none of your business .
and over a jerk like magruder .
he' s not a jerk .
he' s twice the man you are , you roach .
don' t you see ?
he tells you stories to get in your pants .
he won' t leave his wife .
you witnessed my humiliation .
it' s humiliating taking advantage of a smart woman like you .
you' re not fit to discuss chris magruder .
look at this .
she still loves him .
get out before i call the police and have you arrested .
i' m not letting you alone here .
are you crazy ?
i' d ask if you had any friends , but i know the answer .
give me this .
jesus .
great .
are you okay ?
hello ?
what are you doing here ?
i' m making coffee .
i remember .
you came here because you thought i stole the jewels .
this is a very confusing case .
i' il say you' re confused .
why didn' t you go home ?
and let you do something crazy ?
like what ?
like dive out the window .
i wouldn' t even with you here .
because i watched over you .
you stayed up watching me ?
yes .
and you snore like a grizzly bear with a sinus condition .
i had a bad moment .
i' m fine now .
you talk in your sleep .
you probably took notes , inchworm .
who' s rita ?
the woman my ex ran off with .
you sure know how to pick men .
there' s not a lot to pick from .
you mentioned me , too .
you said i should rot in hell .
i was probably awake .
i figured you were felling better .
now , if you' il go .
don' t gossip about what you saw last night .
nobody' s going to because i couldn' t care less about your life .
i couldn' t stand you when i met you and can' t stand you now .
i find you obnoxious and pompous .
do me a favor , if you see me in the office walk the other way .
and if magruder tells you he' s leaving his wife ... if i were you , i' d keep my legs crossed .
don' t choke on breakfast and die , unable to dislodge a piece of toast , no matter how hard you cough !
mr. magruder ?
lf you' il all open your hymn books to page 90 .
sit down , c. w. we have a situation .
your brother looks good .
the embalmer did nice work .
i' il let the coopersmiths fill you in .
after a careful search , using up to the minute techniques ... we found some interesting clues .
leading to who , eleanor roosevelt ?
we got a shoe print at the kensington place .
so ?
an 8 1 l 2 c florsheim cordovan .
worn by 20 million americans .
i wear them .
for this money , you cannot get a better shoe .
we also found a couple of hairs .
one on the rug at the kensington' s , the other in the dillworth safe .
they match .
forgive me if i' m not knocked out .
we don' t mean just each other .
they match yours .
just like the 8 1 l 2 c cordovans .
i know you' re angling for my job ...
we got a print off the matchbook .
a fingerprint off a matchbook ?
our lab uses sensitive apparatus .
you' re not going to say it' s mine ?
it is .
well , so what ?
so i leave a footprint or inadvertently drop a matchbook .
the matchbook was found before you got to the place .
you don' t doubt my honesty , do you ?
i was a boy scout for three years .
i have several merit badges and my clergyman who is wanted for pederasty , will vouch for me .
nobody' s making any accusations .
you do have outstanding debts from betting on baseball , the ponies .
are you investigating me ?
i assure you this is only an inquiry in house at this time .
we' re not looking for bad publicity .
miss fitzgerald , what do you think ?
you' re a bright woman .
you think i did it ?
let' s not have the daily bloodbath between you and miss fitzgerald .
she' s not an investigator .
but she has lots of ideas .
she brought these mouth breathers in .
c. w. , it' s nothing personal .
we all want to catch the thief .
i' m on your side .
i think we have to get team jackets .
rosie , i want to get resumes of all our employees .
don' t worry , c. w. we' il get to the bottom of this .
miss fitzgerald , i wanted to meet with you later .
about what ?
our paris account .
i believe that account is closed .
i have to see you , just to talk .
i behaved like such a fool .
later , just for a drink .
well .
can i come in ?
sure .
i' m shocked .
the place is a little messy .
lf i knew you were coming , i' d have had the maid rearrange the dirt .
are you alone ?
alone ?
of course .
i' d have called , but i decided it was safer to talk in person .
" safer " ?
i can' t stay long .
you meeting magruder in paris ?
that' s none of your business .
thanks for defending me today .
it was nice of you .
that' s what i want to discuss .
the coopersmiths questioned laura kensington today .
she said she was with you the night before last .
you got a phone call , began acting very strangely ... and got rid of her because you had somewhere to go .
she' s lying .
why would she lie ?
use you head .
would i kick laura kensington out of bed ?
even if the president needed me .
why are you lying ?
why this crazy story ?
because i should' ve spoken up today .
even if you are a mealy mouthed ...
reptile . ... reptile , you' re no jewel thief .
why are you so positive ?
it' s too daring for you .
you' re not romantic enough .
it requires flair , imagination .
my instincts say it' s not you .
i didn' t think you had instincts .
i do .
i don' t usually trust them about men , but this time i do .
you' re good at weasely things , like snooping and spying .
you' re not man enough for a burglar .
sounds like you' re attracted to men who break the law .
let' s not discuss me .
let' s discuss what laura said .
laura kensington was not here .
she ...
she was not here .
she said she left her stocking here .
that could be anybody' s .
lots of women pass through here .
there' s a lot of action here .
i' m sure you' re not particular .
look , what do you want from me ?
i enjoy a well proportioned member of the opposite sex .
that' s how god created us .
who am i to quibble with his concept ?
a case is building against you .
be honest with me !
i' m honest .
where did you get this stocking ?
some broad' s .
women lose an earring , a stocking , i don' t know .
laura says it' s hers .
she says the super let her in .
the story checks out .
whoever that is , i' m not here .
who is it ?
herb and joe coopersmith .
i don' t want to be seen here .
why ?
am i a leper ?
you' re a suspect .
i' d have explaining to do .
you' re still hooked on magruder .
go to the bedroom , shut the door .
can i sit down , or will i catch something ?
germs can' t live in your blood .
it' s too cold .
open up , c. w. !
coming .
sure you got the right apartment ?
the mousetraps are in the basement .
can we come in ?
wait .
i got a chorus girl in the back room .
it isn' t laura kensington , is it ?
i don' t know .
they all look the same upside down .
she says she was here the other night , till you dumped her to go out on some mysterious business .
would i dump laura kensington ?
i eat wheaties .
but eddie , the night guard at the north coast building , said you made strange , middle of the night visits to your office the nights of both robberies .
i' d love to chat , but there' s a nurse in the other room .
i thought she was a chorus girl .
who does a little nursing .
gimme a break .
can we talk tomorrow ?
how can you make love ?
you' re facing a long jail sentence .
that' s why i got to get in all i can now .
we' il turn this over to the police tomorrow .
the case is pretty incriminating .
it' s just circumstantial evidence .
many a man' s gone to the gallows on circumstantial evidence .
the gallows will have to wait .
i got a cocktail waitress .
cocktail waitress ?
a nurse who' s a bit of a chorus girl and works a lounge now and then .
tell me if you catch the thief .
i' il get you both new yo yos .
what is this ?
i was browsing through your bookshelf ... and i found this deck of naked playing cards and these .
what ?
this is the kensington jewels !
this is the dillworth jewels .
and this is ...
why are you looking at me like that ?
because you found them among my collection of female art studies ?
what ?
i used to go with the six of spades .
then the four of diamonds caught us together and ...
i knew you sneaked up to the office and the guard caught you .
you have laura' s stocking and she swears you kicked her out of bed to take care of some sudden business .
they have a footprint , a matchbook with your fingerprint .
still , i believed that you didn' t do it .
but now the stolen property turns up hidden in your bedroom .
and what ?
this makes you suspect me ?
i was touched you stayed up all night watching over me .
i thought , " maybe he' s not the scummy vermin he seems to be .
i may be scummy vermin , but i' m honest .
i didn' t take these jewels .
how can you deny it ?
yes , i grant you , there' s a fingerprint of mine , and a footprint and the jewels are in my bedroom .
i' m starting to think i' m in tremendous trouble .
i' m calling the police .
forget logic .
give me the benefit of the doubt .
that makes me an accessory .
not if i' m innocent .
lnnocent ?
you haven' t a kosher bone in your body .
that' s how you get into problems .
magruder' s waiting for you , right ?
you make wrong decisions because you make them here , not here .
they' re not reliable because this is gray cells and this is blood .
blood circulates , it gets around .
it knows the score .
gray cells just lay there and think .
see what i mean ?
constantinople .
you will take all of the jewels .
make sure you have them all .
wrap them in brown paper so no on can tell what they are .
go to grand central station .
rent a locker .
lock them in .
go home , taking the key with you .
put it in your mailbox .
leave the mailbox open .
then you will go into a deep , refreshing slumber .
when you awake , you will remember nothing of what transpired .
miss fitzgerald , have i ever told you ... you' re one of the most beautiful women i' ve ever met ?
i' m turning you in .
i mean it .
your eyes are what made me first fall in love with you .
unbelievable .
you' re trying to sweet talk me ?
i resisted because down deep i thought you might hurt me .
i don' t want to be in that position again .
i wouldn' t be interested in you if you were the last man on earth .
and i' m insulted you think i would fall for such a heavy handed ploy .
you must have a low opinion of me .
thank you for dropping by .
i' m a little busy now .
maybe tomorrow night we can have dinner .
i can look into your eyes and tell you how crazy about you i am .
lf i didn' t know what a squirming , trapped rat you were ,
i' d think you had a brain tumor .
you' re late .
i' m still trembling .
over last night ?
i didn' t sleep .
it' s not that , chris .
it' s briggs .
he' s guilty , isn' t he ?
it' s a sad story .
don' t make me go into the details , but i wonder if he' s having a mental breakdown .
he may be realizing the consequences of his deeds .
could he have a split personality ?
many criminals play crafty games when it suits their purposes .
i need a drink .
lf i tell you something , promise not to go off half cocked ?
okay , but hurry .
i have some big news .
i found the jewels .
keep me apprised , will you ?
thank you .
the police are on the way .
it' s an open and shut case .
i hate the publicity , but i' m elated at the recovery .
it' s clear there' s much more to this , chris .
being around big money can drive men to extremes .
these guys expose exotic schemes to defraud and rob people .
some think " i know why they fail .
i won' t make mistakes " .
so he' s cracked from so many years of hard work ?
he' s a driven man .
he had a terrible marital experience .
turned him off women , except for secretaries and barflies .
crushed when he caught his wife cheating , he' s feeling older , he looks around and says " maybe it' s time i get mine .
guy named peterson tried the same .
now he' s a houseguest in sing sing .
i' m sure you know him better than i do .
it' il resolve itself .
betty ann , i spoke with caroline .
you did ?
i told her i wanted my freedom .
really ?
lsn' t that fabulous ?
it' s surprising .
i thought you' d be knocked off your feet .
well , it was last night .
it' s sort of a roller coaster .
forget last night .
i knew i made a mistake right away .
what did she say ?
she sensed we were drifting apart .
she was very poised .
said if i was sure that' s what i wanted .
another one of these , please .
you' re not as euphoric as i' d imagined .
you can' t expect me to change gears and turn on a dime .
have you changed your mind ?
no .
you haven' t met someone else ?
no , i haven' t .
i don' t understand .
what' s going on ?
what did i do ?
these are the ones .
they were in his bookcase .
he bets every day and he usually loses .
he' s into the bookmakers for a bundle .
i was with him tuesday till 1 2 .
he got a call and was different .
lf it was anyone but c. w. , we wouldn' t be discussing this .
the jewels were in his locker .
an air tight case .
i knew you guys wanted my job , but i could get 30 years for this .
with good behavior , you' il be out in 20 .
i' il check every low l . q. club .
i' il find you and kill you .
low l . q. , some genius .
lf you needed money , c. w. , you could' ve come to me .
i' d have listened , though i warned you about your gambling .
can' t you see this is a conspiracy ?
they plant some prints .
the night guard forges my signature .
this crazy girl who smokes opium invents a story .
fitzgerald plants the jewels in my house .
there' s a word for people who think everyone' s conspiring against them .
yeah , " perceptive " .
you tried to swallow the key to the locker where we found the stolen goods .
you got any witnesses ?
yeah , me .
you' d take your word over mine ?
let' s get him to the courthouse .
you better get a lawyer , c. w.
i' m shocked .
he was one of my best men .
you know how long i' ve know him ?
tommy , come with me .
okay , mike .
sorry , c. w. , i' il arrange things .
stick around .
well , well , if it isn' t mr. fast talking lnvestigator caught with his hand in the cookie jar .
did i really throw you out of bed ?
why ?
you planning on using the insanity defense ?
honey , i need help , and you' re going to help me .
am l ?
what makes you think that ?
this is your kind of thing .
it' il look great on your resume .
a suspected felon , a daring escape in broad daylight .
you like this kind of thing .
check the top drawer .
there must be a handcuff key .
i' m nervous .
see if there' s a key .
go .
hurry up .
i got to make this fast .
or they' il put me away .
i' il be showering with men my whole life .
miss , i' m sorry .
no one' s allowed in here .
you want to come with me ?
let' s go , unless you want to be locked up , too .
sorry things didn' t work out .
let' s go .
you want to lock me up ?
what' s wrong ?
take your hands off me !
something wrong with you ?
caroline and i are working on the separation agreement .
i move out in 2 weeks .
the divorce will take longer .
that' s why the agreement must be secure .
i could get killed if we were found together .
where are you ?
do you think he' s guilty ?
that' s what you' re thinking about ?
i have this uneasy feeling .
that he' s innocent ?
he was caught red handed .
it just doesn' t feel right .
i don' t see that snoopy termite as a romantic jewel thief .
i' d hardly call breaking the law romantic .
i didn' t mean it that way .
well , what did you mean ?
i don' t know what i mean anymore .
yes , he is .
hold on .
it' s the coopersmiths .
really ?
how ?
okay .
yes , i certainly will .
this should allay your doubts about his culpability .
he escaped .
unlocked the handcuffs and leaped to the building next door .
c. w. briggs ?
like a common burglar .
i' m starting to realize none of us really knew him .
i have to go to police headquarters .
your little termite ate his way out .
did you forget ... ?
resist the urge to scream .
what are you doing here , you jewel thief !
i' m not a thief , i' m a suspect .
completely different .
a promising suspect , but i didn' t do it and i need time to prove it .
or they' il lock me up and you could only insult me on visiting days .
why did you come here ?
i have no one else to turn to .
everyone knows you hate me so no one will look for me here .
i need a place to sleep .
i' m exhausted .
you can' t sleep here .
i can' t afford the fumigation bills .
you want to call the police , call them .
i don' t care .
i' m sleeping here . lf you want to call them , then call them .
get me the 1 1th precinct .
miss fitzgerald ?
madagascar .
you are in a deep trance .
you will obey every command the jade scorpion gives you .
you will acquire all security data for the adrian greenwood mansion .
you will proceed there , and after disabling the system you will remove all the jewels from the safe , each and every one .
these jewels you will hide in your apartment . ls this clear ?
yes .
what' s the matter ?
can' t sleep ?
no .
i' ve had the strangest dreams .
i' ve had some crazy dreams myself lately .
i dreamed we were finally together .
you and magruder ?
a match made in heaven by a retarded angel .
you misunderstand .
i dreamed you and i wound up together .
that' s funny .
i didn' t hear screaming .
the minute i met you , i knew inside i' d found ... what i' d been searching for all my life .
a roach ?
a vermin ?
a worm ?
did i call you a black widow ?
i knew that sooner or later we' d wind up in each other' s arms .
have you been gargling with the tequila ?
you' re a very romantic man .
what did you smoke before i woke up ?
and if i told you i had the most passionate crush on you i ever felt ?
i' d fear for my life because i' d think it was a set up .
this song was playing the time we met at rocky' s bar .
you remember ?
not that i didn' t have a good time , but i didn' t .
my passion for you is so intense , it scares me .
can' t you see i' ve submerged it under hostile acts and words ?
don' t worry , i never really took it seriously .
crush you like an insect " just meant " back off a little " .
couldn' t you see i was just protecting myself ?
miss fitzgerald ...
call me betty ann .
i hate to be a killjoy , but if this is a scheme to take advantage of me , it' s not subtle .
you' re the man i' m going to marry .
i knew it right away .
we should call bellevue .
you need electric shock , honey .
kiss me ?
me ?
lay a wet one on you ?
i imagined if you kissed me , i' d feel those fireworks .
are you like this out of the office ?
what are you thinking ?
it' s a pity we hate each other or we could' ve had a large family .
i' m going to swoon .
steady .
i affect women this way sometimes .
i can' t stay awake .
easy .
i' il rest my head on you .
easy .
i must remember what soap i used this morning .
what are you doing here ?
good morning , sweetheart .
don' t call me that .
what' s going on ?
i stayed awake thinking about those things you said .
and all of that rang a deep bell with me .
there were so many times when we were arguing in the office that i had the feeling that down deep , underneath , you were crazy about me .
about you ?
were you dropped on your head ?
hey , toots , i got to tell you , last night , for a cold fish , you were hot stuff .
buster , don' t call me " toots " or " sweetheart " .
i' m not some available annie who takes dictation on your lap .
what' d you do , sneak in here and slip into my arms ?
what' s going on ?
last night you tried to undress me and kiss me .
what ?
you came in here and passed out .
i' m confused .
the kensington and dillworth jewel thief has struck again .
c. w. briggs , former employee of north coast fidelity and casualty , is the chief suspect in the adrian greenwood robbery .
the details of the crime are the same as the first two .
the thief took $ 1 million in jewelry and a like amount in cash .
police recovered the jewels from the earlier burglaries which led to the capture and arrest of c. w. briggs .
so that' s why you escaped .
not to prove your innocence , but for unfinished business .
but i was here with you !
for some reason i can' t remember .
but i was asleep .
you could' ve awakened , robbed these people and come back .
you used this as a safe haven .
i could' ve , but i didn' t .
you tried to undress and kiss me .
i' ve never tried to undress you in my life .
i wouldn' t kiss you if we were on a desert island for 20 years .
after 20 minutes i' d make a bow and arrow and kill you .
what are you thinking ?
i' m marrying chris magruder .
you are ?
yes .
we set a spring date , when his divorce is final .
so if i was trying to kiss you , i must have multiple personalities .
lf you marry chris magruder , you have multiple stupidity .
it must have been the booze .
you were like a changed person , and a much better one .
lf you' re here after i take a shower , i' m calling the police .
for a minute you dropped your guard .
your were actually sexy .
though in some lights , you resemble mussolini .
pretty snazzy for an office worker .
magruder must love you in an extravagant way .
he probably likes going to paris with you more than with his wife .
i understand you and charlie got something .
i came up with a name .
really ?
well , lay it on me .
eddie polgar .
who' s that ?
i don' t know , but it' s come up twice .
eddie polgar ?
there' s no police record .
it could be an alias .
blue men coming .
keep moving .
charlie .
c. w. , is that you ?
i heard you wanted me .
you' re hot as a pistol .
the police want to give me a lifetime achievement award .
does the name eddie polgar mean anything to you ?
zero .
i can' t get a break .
stick your hand in the cup .
ln the cup ?
ln the cup , yeah .
38 cents and a wad of paper .
and someone threw away their gum in your business establishment .
open the wad of paper .
why ?
it' s a clue .
what kind of clue ?
from last night' s heist .
coopersmiths found it on the driveway .
charlie ...
the burglar dropped it .
how' d you get it ?
a friend of a friend works in the coopersmiths ' building .
i thought you might want it .
these earrings are grand larceny .
i see by the look on your face that i helped you .
cherchez la femme .
you know what that means ?
find the woman " .
ls there a woman ?
at first i thought so .
then i didn' t .
now i think i got her .
you work next to a person for years and one day ...
i don' t believe it .
not c. w. it makes no sense .
none of us expected it , but there is proof .
fitzgerald saw the jewels in his apartment .
he fought the cops over that key .
exactly .
it' s open and shut .
you don' t run from the police if you' re innocent .
what about the nerve it took to strike twice ?
c. w. deserves some credit .
he turned out to be a gutsy guy .
where are you ?
never mind where i am .
i got to get up to the office .
i think more people are involved in this thing .
i think fitzgerald is behind it .
does the name eddie polgar mean anything to you ?
no .
i got to get to the office and go over the coopersmiths ' report .
and i want to check out fitzgerald' s desk again .
there' s no question , fitzgerald is involved in this up to her neck .
you can' t let your feelings for this woman color your judgment .
it has nothing to do with that .
it' s the only thing that makes sense .
i go to her house , figuring no one will look for me there because she hates me so .
i go to sleep .
middle of the night , i hear a noise and wake up .
i find her .
i figure , she can' t sleep , either .
but , no .
she' d done the greenwood heist and coming back .
i' d caught her , so she starts to act very peculiar .
i trap her , so she starts seducing me with her feminine wiles .
meaning what ?
suddenly , i' m handsome and and she can' t her hands off me .
does that sound like fitzgerald ?
or a schemer trying to play me for a sucker ?
it sounds like that magic show demonstration by voltan polgar .
yeah .
the night of the first robbery .
i think she has feelings for you .
don' t be ridiculous .
she hates me .
what' s the name of the magician whose name
i' ve completely repressed ?
voltan .
voltan the lnscrutable .
the jade scorpion .
what is his name ?
voltan polgar .
eli voytak polgar .
i' m just theorizing ... on an incredible sequence of events .
you look like my uncle jerry after a truck hit him .
what happened ?
i know you told me before , but what happened ?
they brought me onstage ...
he put you in a trance , easily , despite your resistance .
right , yes .
then he brought ...
fitzgerald was with me at the time .
then you were awakened in a post hypnotic state with a word that would put you back under .
constantinople " .
then he started making these ...
c. w. ?
c. w. ?
yes ?
are you okay ?
i' m fine , alvin .
how is your aging mother ?
obviously , he was never released from the key word .
wake him up , george .
this is scary .
don' t be scared .
this is right up my alley .
when i snap my fingers , you will awaken .
you will have no memory of what occurred . ls that clear ?
you' il awaken feeling happy and refreshed . ls that clear ?
so the guy gets me onstage .
then what ?
wait .
i have an idea .
constantinople .
what a sense of power .
can you make him recall everything , then free him from it for good ?
when i snap my fingers , you will awaken .
your memory will be clear , crystal clear .
the events of the past week will come to you vividly .
and with no distraction .
you will be freed from your trance ... and the word " constantinople " will have no meaning to you .
it will not put back into your hypnotic state .
one , you' re coming out of it .
two , your memories of the past week are coming back .
three , you' re fully awake .
i took the jewels !
the kensington and the dill ...
then he probably tried to get me and couldn' t .
the greenwood thing was her ... what is fitzgerald' s key word ?
madagascar .
the jade scorpion wants the jewels .
wrap them in brown paper and bring them to him .
mark down the following address in chinatown .
miss fitzgerald ?
sergeant , his name' s voltan polgar .
someone just gave me an address .
miss fitzgerald .
the jade scorpion welcomes you .
you have my package .
thank you .
you will now return home and go to sleep ... a wonderful sleep , from which you' il awaken cheerfully .
you will remember nothing of these events .
ever .
i was just passing through .
i thought i' d say hello .
c. w. briggs , i seem to have underestimated you .
the story of my life .
everybody underestimates me .
they think i' m a pushover .
it makes my work much easier .
i' ve seen some exotic schemes , but this one was a beauty .
but i figured it out .
that' s why i get top dollar .
don' t force me to take extreme measures , mr. briggs .
you' d never pull that trigger .
oh ?
why ?
murder' s not your game .
my instinct tells me that .
you' re a jewel thief .
there' s a big difference between doing time for stealing jewels and frying in the electric chair .
once they pump 200 millions volts of electricity through you you have a tendency to spend the rest of your days in an ashtray .
for a minute , i thought i overplayed my hand .
you' re the bravest , most brilliant , most courageous man i' ve ever met .
i would go to the ends of the earth with you .
everybody should have someone they feel that way about .
it' s such a shame that you have to wake up from this fabulous illusion .
just once , before the ugly curtain of reality drops on both of us .
you kiss great .
what a wrap up .
see herb coopersmith' s face ?
serves him right .
where will fitzgerald and magruder go for their romantic getaway ?
his divorce isn' t for months .
i hear his wife couldn' t care less .
i hear the wedding' s in june .
i heard him talking about going to paris .
mr. magruder , i just came to say i' m leaving .
what can i say ?
we all make mistakes .
you have to admit , they had a strong case against you .
i know you could get a job anywhere .
but if you decide to stay , you' il have a raise .
miss fitzgerald won' t be in your way .
between us , once we marry she' s retiring whether she wants to or not .
i' m not having a wife at work in my own office .
think positively .
i' il be away a few weeks , we' re going to paris .
the actual city , or ... ?
you need a vacation .
why not see if you can get laura kensington to go ?
i wouldn' t mind that action myself .
she seemed struck by you .
she' s a bit demented , but in a hotel room , that can be fun .
i came to say good bye .
right .
chris and i have a plane to catch .
no .
i mean i' m leaving .
i' m quitting .
it should make you happy .
you can enjoy your vacation because when you come back , you wont see me .
you can revamp everything .
no static .
want to have a parting drink ?
at ten o' clock in the morning ?
it' s only tequila .
what can you say about a woman who keeps mexican booze in her desk ?
let' s drink to both our futures .
today , mr. magruder .
tomorrow the world .
i' il let that pass because this is goodbye .
you' re really going to marry him .
for a brilliant woman
i' ve got to say you have the worst taste in men .
i didn' t take up with you .
how bad could my taste be ?
you know behind those nasty remarks ... is a very vulnerable , sweet , sexy woman .
but don' t ever let that come out because you could risk being happy .
and that would kill you .
we will be happy .
your instinct said he' d never leave his wife .
my instincts are good , but they' re not infallible .
this was one where i was wrong .
have a terrific rest of your life and try not to jump out of windows .
be sure the elevator' s there before you get in .
one man plunged 1 5 stories and wound up a vegetable .
i' il let that pass , ' cause this is goodbye .
briggsie , i was just saying , you quit , i go with you .
c. w. you' re our hero .
this was a tough nut to crack .
no , this was all luck .
lf george didn' t know hypnosis , i wouldn' t have known anything .
it' s amazing .
you can put someone under and force them to do outrageous things .
that' s absolutely wrong .
a hypnotized person won' t do anything they won' t do in real life .
really ?
are you saying , at heart , i' m a thief ?
we knew there was a little bit of larceny in you .
you always said " it takes one to catch one .
there was also a bit of larceny in miss fitzgerald .
what a shock .
turns out there are a lot of surprises in her .
come here .
you have a crush on her , don' t you ?
who ?
fitzgerald ?
what are you talking about ?
i' ve always known it .
you can' t hate someone that much without feeling some attraction .
says who ?
my instinct .
come on , you were the one who taught me to trust it .
i think i' m in love with her .
it' s the stupidest thing that' s ever happened to me .
take the bull by the horns .
she' s leaving in about 3 minutes .
go !
miss fitzgerald , marry me .
i guess c. w. ' s had a few .
pretty early for that .
i had some tequila or i wouldn' t be able to say this .
i love you .
marry me .
you embarrassing me .
you can' t marry the wrong person , when you love me .
you' re making her uncomfortable .
what could make you think i could think of you that way , you ...
i know . " nearsighted cockroach " can' t you see the venom under ...
betty , let' s go .
c. w. , leave here at once .
your idea of moving on wasn' t so crazy .
i' m opening up to you .
i' m putting my heart in your hands .
i was hard because i feared you , like you feared me .
this is the real thing and it terrifies us .
yes , i fear you .
you and boris karloff .
your heroics do not entitle you to be an obnoxious boor .
how is a man confessing love be an obnoxious boor ?
betty and i have a plans , and they don' t include you .
you want to spend your life married to the wrong guy ?
why would i marry you ?
stop talking like i' m not here .
because it' s me you love .
you' re too old , too nearsighted for me too short for me .
you left out the best part .
i' m losing my hair .
goodbye , c. w. and i mean for good .
wait a minute .
betty ann , where are you going ?
madagascar ?
someone call the plane .
say we might be late .
you go ahead , chris .
i' m staying here .
i' m staying with c. w.
we have an announcement to make .
betty ann , you have a crazy look in your eye .
i' ve never felt so normal in my life .
i can' t guarantee every time i kiss you there' il be fireworks .
i fell in love the second i saw you .
i want this woman helped !
get an ambulance .
call my wife' s attorney !
have them halt the separation !
she' il take you back , with some new ground rules , but you' il adapt .
so much passion in a lousy insurance office .
congratulations .
a little going away present for you .
should we get out of here and find somewhere to start making up for lost time ?
how about my place ?
i think i can live with that .
god bless everyone .
and god bless tiny tim .
shall we ?
good luck , you two .
what' il happen when she wakes up and is back to her old self ?
he' il have to say " madagascar " first thing every morning .
my gosh , who' d have thunk it ?
what a break for c. w. that you forgot to deprogram miss fitzgerald .
what are you saying ?
i deprogrammed her last night .
you don' t have to worry .
i' il never leave you .
tell me how you feel about me .
you' re the most wonderful man in the world .
the handsomest , the most brilliant , the sexiest .
someday i' m going to make you really feel those things .
anything' s possible .
i made you feel that way and i didn' t have to say " constantinople " .
that' s right !
