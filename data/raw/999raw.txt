i' m gonna show you what this car can really do .
are you ready ?
i am ready .
hang on .
okay .
here we go .
this has pedals like a race car .
they' re really close together .
so it' s probably easier for a woman to drive , ' cause they have little feet .
except me .
i wear a size nine .
you know your foot' s as big as your arm from your elbow to your wrist ?
did you know that ?
no , i didn' t know that .
it' s a little bit of trivia .

i was , uh , working last night .
you don' t sleep , you don' t do drugs , you don' t drink , you hardly eat .
what do you do , edward ?
' cause i know you' re not a lawyer .
that' s right .
there are four other chairs here .
oh .
so what do you do ?
i buy companies .
what kind of companies ?
uh , i buy companies that are in financial difficulty .
if they have problems , you must get ' em for a bargain , huh ?
well , the company i' m buying this week ,
i' m getting for the bargain price of about one billion .
a billion dollars ?
yes .
wow .
you must be really smart , huh ?
i only got through the eleventh grade .
how far did you go in school ?
i went all the way .
your folks must be really proud , huh ?
so you don' t actually have a billion dollars , huh ?
no , i get some of it from banks , investors .
it' s not an easy thing to do .
and you don' t make anything and you don' t build anything .
no .
no .
so what do you do with the companies once you buy them ?
i sell them .
here , let me do that .
you sell them .
well , i ... don' t sell the whole company ; i break it up into pieces ... and then i sell that off ; it' s worth more than the whole .
so it' s sort of like , um , stealing cars and selling ' em for the parts , right ?
yeah , sort of .
but legal .
mm hmm .
there .
see , now it' s perfect .
not bad .
not bad at all .

things that go on in other hotels don' t happen at the regent beverly wilshire .
now , mr. lewis , however , is a very special customer , and we like to think of our special customers as friends .
now , as a customer , we would expect mr.
lewis to sign in any additional guests , but as a friend , we' re willing to overlook it .
now , i' m assuming that you' re a
relative ?
yes .
i thought so .
then you must be his
niece ?
of course .
naturally , when mr. lewis leaves , i won' t see you in this hotel again .
i assume you have no other uncles here .
good !
then we understand each other .
i would also encourage you ... to dress a little more appropriately ; that' il be all .
no , that' s not all .
that' s what i was trying to do .
i tried to go ... get a dress on rodeo drive today , and the women wouldn' t help me .
and i have all this money now and no dress !
not that i expect you to help me , but i have all of this , okay ?
i have to buy a dress for dinner tonight .
and nobody will help me .
oh , man , if you' re callin ' the cops .
yeah , call the cops .
that' s great .

her name is vivian .
she' s a special guest .
she' s the niece of a very special guest .
now , this is the jewel in morse' s crown : prime industrial property straddling the port of long beach and los angeles .
the real estate possibilities are endless , but most of the yard we' il just level .
we just got the information , mr. stuckey .
edward , we just got the morse update .
don , can you hold the projection , please ?
yeah , what ?
speak .
old man morse just got the inside track on a $350 million contract ...
to build destroyers for the navy .
navy contract .
i can' t believe this .
you said they had nothing in the hopper on this one !
i thought they didn' t .
hey , you know , if that' s true it could cost a lot more .
those stocks could go through the roof .
yeah , no shit , sherlock .
maybe we' re lucky to get this information now , sir .
see , we can still walk away from it .
walk away ?
hey , forget it , pal .
we got a thousand man hours in on this !
nobody' s walkin ' away from anything !
philip , i think he' s right .
gentlemen , relax !
relax !
who do we know on the senate appropriations committee ?
senator adams .
all right , senator adams .
let' s find out where he is .
the navy' s not gonna spend $350 million on anything without going to appropriations first .
i don' t understand what' s goin ' on here today , gentlemen .
hello ?
that' s why i hired you , phil , to do my worrying for me .
i' il be in your office .

i' il meet you in the lobby , but only ' cause you' re payin ' me to .
well , thank you very much .
get her back for me , please .
mr. stuckey wanted to see you .
yes , tell him i' m in the middle of a very important phone call .
hello ?
i told you not to pick up the phone .

dinner napkin .
dinner napkin , laid gently in the lap .

elbows off the table .

shrimp fork , salad fork , dinner fork .

i' m mr. thompson .
i' m the manager of the hotel .
uh huh .
excuse me , i just want to make one call .
yes , um , sir .
i have a message for you , sir .
from who ?
from your niece , sir .
my what ?
the young lady who' s staying with you in your room , sir .
oh .
hmm .
i think we both know that she' s not my niece .
of course .
the reason i know that is that i am an only child .
yes , sir .
what' s the message ?
she' s waiting for you in the lounge .
intriguing young lady , miss vivian .
intriguing .
have a good evening , sir .
thank you , mr. ?
thompson .
i' m the manager manager of the hotel , sir .
you' re late .
you' re stunning .
you' re forgiven .
shall we go to dinner ?
this way , mr. lewis .
your party is waiting .
stop fidgeting .
mr. morse .
yes , mr. lewis .
i' m jim morse .
this fireball is my grandson , david .
well , i don' t know about the fireball part , but grandson is true enough .
i' m pleased to meet you both .
this is a friend of mine , vivian ward .
hi .
i' m really glad to meet you .
mr. morse .
david .
please , sit .
excuse me .
where are you going ?
i' m going to the ladies ' room .
upstairs , to the right .
okay .
excuse me .
shall i order for you ?
yeah .
please do so .
thank you .
i' il do that .
mr. lewis , my grandfather believes the men who create a company ...
should control its destiny .
where' s the salad ?
uh , the salad comes at the end of the meal .
that' s the fork i knew .
let me , uh , put it another way .
between your public statements and the rumors flying around on this thing , we find it very hard to figure out what your real intentions are .
i don' t know about you , but i' ve never been able to figure which goes with what !
you know , there was a time when we built ships the size of cities .
men like my grandfather made this country .
who ordered this ?
the gentleman did , ma' am .
bon appetite .
these are escargot .
it' s french for snails .
it' s a delicacy .
try it .
david ?
mr. lewis , if you were to get control and i don' t think you will but if you did , what do you plan to do with the company ?
break it up and sell off the pieces .
i' m sure you' il understand i' m not thrilled at the idea ... of your turning 40 years of my work into your garage sale .
at the price i' m paying for this stock , mr. morse , you are going to be a very rich man .
i' m rich enough .
i just want to head my shipyard .
slippery little suckers .
it happens all the time .
i met your father .
what' s his name ?
carter .
yeah .
carter .
carter lewis .
he' s not quite the bastard everybody says he is .
no , i have the franchise on that .
does that make him proud ?
i doubt it .
it doesn' t really matter now .
he passed away .
oh , i hadn' t heard .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry too .
mr. morse , you asked for this meeting .
what can i do for you ?
leave my company alone .
i can' t do that .
i own ten million shares .
i' il buy your stock back .
you don' t have the money .
we will ; we' re getting a contract to build ten destroyers .
there will be no contract .
the contract is now buried in appropriations committee .
and it will remain there .
and how the hell did you pull something like that ?
you got dirty politicians in your pockets now or something ?
easy , easy , calm down .
calm down , david .
mr. lewis plays hardball .
yes , yes , i do .
i' ve heard enough of this .
vivian , it was a great pleasure to meet you .
i' m sorry , grandfather .
i' ve gotta get some air .
mr. lewis .
i' d better join my grandson .
you two enjoy your dinner .
i' m sure it' il be delicious .
good luck , miss .
watch out , lewis .
i' m gonna tear you apart .
i look forward to it , sir .
edward ?
when you turn tricks .
that' s why no kissing .
it' s too personal .
you stay numb , you don' t get involved .
when i' m with a guy , i' m like a robot .
i just do it .
i mean ... except with you .
oh , of course , not with me .
you and i are such similar creatures , vivian .
we both screw people for money .
i was sorry to hear about your dad .
when did he die ?
last month .
do you miss him ?
i hadn' t spoken to him in fourteen and a half years .
i wasn' t there when he died .
do you want to talk about this ?
no .
well , i tell you what , ' cause i got an idea .
let' s watch old movies all night .
we' il just veg out in front of the tv .
" veg out " ?
yeah .
be still like vegetables .
lay like broccoli .
look , i' il tell you what .
i' il be back .
we' il do broccoli tomorrow .
where are you going ?
i' m going downstairs for a while .
did you say marriage license ?
now , don' t change the subject , just give me the stamp .
oh , i love you , adam , alex , peter , brian , whatever your name is .
oh , i love you .
hi , uh , i' m in the penthouse .
the guy that was here ,
mr. lewis , have you seen him down there anywhere ?
thank you .
thank you very much .
i didn' t know you played .
i only play for strangers .
i was gettin ' lonely upstairs all by myself .
gentlemen , would you mind leaving us , please ?
thank you .
people always do what you tell them to do ?
i guess so .
wake up .
time to shop .
now , if you have any trouble using this card , have them call the hotel .
all right ?
more shopping .
mm hmm .
i' m surprised you didn' t buy more than one dress yesterday .
wasn' t as much fun as i thought it was gonna be .
why not ?
they were mean to me .
mean to you ?
people are looking at me .
they' re not looking at you ; they' re looking at me .
the stores are not nice to people .
i don' t like it .
stores are never nice to people ; they' re nice to credit cards .
okay , stop fidgeting .
get rid of your gum .
i don' t believe you did that .
yes .
i am mr. hollister , the manager .
may i help you ?
edward lewis .
ah , yes , sir .
you see this young lady over here .
yes .
do you have anything in this shop as beautiful as she is ?
oh , yes .
oh , no !
no , no , no , i' m saying we have many things as beautiful as she would want them to be .
that' s the point i was getting at , and i think we can all agree with that .
that' s why when you came in  excuse me .
we' re gonna need a few more people helping us .
i' il tell you why .
we' re going to be spending an obscene amount of money in here .
so we' re going to need a lot more help sucking up to us .
that' s what we really like .
you understand that .
sir , you' re in the right store and the right city for that matter .
anything you see here , we can do , by the way .
get ready to have some fun .
mary pat , mary kate , mary francis , tovah , let' s see it !
come on .
bring it out , girls .
oh , this is absolutely divine .
excuse me , sir , uh , yeah ? exactly how obscene an amount of money were you talking about ?
just profane or really offensive ?
really offensive .
i like him so much !
mr. lewis , sir .
mr. lewis , how' s it going so far ?
pretty well , i think .
i think we need some major sucking up .
very well , sir .
you' re not only handsome , but a powerful man .
i could see the second you walked in here , you were someone to reckon with
hollister .
yes , sir .
not me .
her .
i' m sorry , sir .
i' m sorry .
how we doing , ladies ?
oh , edward , edward .
where the hell are you ?
the word' s all over the street .
morse is gonna raise your offer , pal .
he' s countering ?
god , he is a tough old bird .
he knows the navy contracts are stalled .
where' s he gonna get the money ?
i don' t know .
he , uh i think he' s throwin ' in with the employees .
he still needs someone to underwrite the paper .
find out who it is .
yeah , okay .
you got it .
you' re on your own .
i have to go back to work .
you look great !
she has my card .
and we' il help her use it , sir .

mister lewis .
gentlemen .
fellas , let' s finish this up this afternoon , huh ?
jake , set something up with blair .
around 2 : 00 , 2 : 30 would be good .
you were right about morse .
he mortgaged everything he owns , right down to his underwear , to secure a loan from the bank .
and it' s not just any bank .
plymouth trust , huh ?
hmm .
so , it goes without saying ... that your business means a lot more to them than our friend , mr. morse .
all you gotta do is call the bank .
yeah .
edward , excuse me for saying this , but what the hell is wrong with you this week ?
are you givin ' morse a chance to get away ?
you know what i used to love when i was a kid , phil ?
what ?
blocks .
building blocks .
erector sets .
so , i liked monopoly .
boardwalk , park place .
wh what' s the point ?
we don' t build anything , phil .
we don' t make anything .
we make money , edward .
we worked for a year on this deal .
it' s what you said you wanted .
i' m handing it to you .
morse' s jugular is exposed .
it' s time for the kill .
let' s finish this .
call the bank !
how was your day , dear ?
nice tie .
i got it for you .
well , my mother was a music teacher ... and married my father , whose family was extremely wealthy .
then he divorced my mother to be with another woman .
and he took his money with him .
and then she died .
i was very angry with him .
it cost me $10, 000 in therapy to say that sentence .
i was very angry with him .
i do it very well , don' t i ?
i' il say it again .
i was very angry with him .
hello , my name is mr. lewis .
i' m very angry with my father .
i would' ve been angry at the $10, 000 .
my father was president of the third company i ever took over .
i bought it .
i sold it off piece by piece .
what' d the shrink say ?
he said i was cured .
well , so you got even .
that must' ve made you happy .
did i mention my leg is 44 inches from hip to toe , so , basically , we' re talkin ' about 88 inches of therapy ... wrapped around you for the bargain price of ... [ together ]
$3, 000 .
yeah .
ebersol of the falcons passes to kennan .

i spend time with them , yeah .
well , no wonder .
no wonder what ?
no wonder why you came looking for me .
and i do need some help from you ladies and gentlemen in the audience .
we need you to help replace some of the divots out here on the grass .
so come on out now .
come on !
come on , folks .
you heard her .
the stomping of the divots .
this is a time honored tradition , ladies and gentlemen .
as old as the game of polo itself .
kings and queens used to do this .
she' s sweet , edward .
wherever did you find her ?
976 babe .
avoid the steaming divot !
no , it' s all part of the game of polo .
you get to have your shoes polished by a member of the club .
i think i got something in the car that will buff that up .
thank you .
vivian , hi .
david morse .
excuse me .
david .
how are ya ?
i' m okay .
i thought that was you .
i like this hat .
it' s new .

she' s in sales .
sales ?
that' s terrific .

what does she sell ?
why do you want to know ?
just hear me out on this .
i' ve known you a long time .
i see some differences in you this week , like the tie , and , uh
i' m wondering if maybe this girl isn' t the difference , especially when i see her talking to david morse .
i introduced them at dinner the other night .
so what ?
now they' re best friends ?
this girl appears out of nowhere .
now she' s talking to a guy whose company we' re trying to buy .
convenient , don' t you think ?
don' t be ridiculous .
how do you know that this girl ... hasn' t attached herself to you because she' s bringing information back to morse ?
this happens !
industrial espionage  phil , phil , phil !
phil , listen to me .
what ?
she' s not a spy .
she is a hooker .
oh !
she is a hooker .
i picked her up on hollywood boulevard .
in your car .
oh , you are  yes , yes .
oh , man !
you' re the only millionaire i ever heard of ... who goes looking for a bargain basement streetwalker , you know ?
edward !
i' m sorry i told you .
senator .
senator adams , i' m pleased you could make it .
thank you .
i hope the information i gave you was helpful .
oh , absolutely , yes , and thank you for it .
there' s no change , is there ?
no , it' s still bogged down .
having a nice time , vivian ?
yeah , i' m having a great time .
must be quite a change from hollywood boulevard , hmm ?
what ?
yeah , edward told me .
but don' t worry ; you' re secret is safe with me .

philip .

seven " fines " since we left the match .
could i have another word , please ?
asshole !
there' s a word .
i think i liked " fine " better .
you know what ?
why did you make me get all dressed up ?
well , for one thing , the clothing was appropriate .
no , what i mean is , if you were gonna tell everybody i' m a hooker ,
why didn' t you just let me wear my own clothes , okay ?
i did not i did not
i mean , in my own clothes , when someone like that guy stuckey comes up to me ,
i can handle it ; i' m prepared .
i' m very sorry .
i' m not happy with stuckey at all for saying or doing that .
but he is my attorney .
i' ve known him for ten years .
he thought you were some kind of industrial spy .
the guy' s paranoid .
are you my pimp now ?
you think you can pass me around to your friends ?
i' m not some little toy !
look , i know you' re not my toy .
vivian !
vivian , i' m speaking to you .
come back here !
i hate to point out the obvious , but you are , in fact , a hooker !
and you are my employee !
look , you don' t own me .
i decide , okay ?
i say who ; i say when ; l i say who
i refuse to spend the next three days fighting with you .
i said i was sorry .
i meant it .
that' s the end of it !
i' m sorry i ever met you .
i' m sorry i ever got into your stupid car !
as if you had so many more appealing options .
i' ve never had anyone make me feel as cheap as you did today .
somehow , i find that very hard to believe .
where are you going ?
i want my money .
i want to get out of here .
come on !
i' m sorry .
i wasn' t prepared to answer questions about us .
it was stupid and cruel .
i didn' t mean it .
i don' t want you to go .
will you stay the week ?
why ?
i saw you talking to david morse ; i didn' t like it .
we were just talking .
i didn' t like it .
down ?
you hurt me .
yes .
don' t do it again .
first guy i ever loved was a total nothing .
second was worse .
my mom called me a bum magnet .
if there was a bum within a 50 mile radius , i was completely attracted to him .
that' s how i ended up here .
i followed bum number three .
oh .
so here i was : no money , no friends , no bum .
and you chose this as your profession ?
i worked at a couple fast food places , parked cars at wrestling .
and i couldn' t make the rent .
i was too ashamed to go home .
that' s when i met kit .
she was a hooker and made it sound so great .
so one day i did it .
i cried the whole time .
but then i got some regulars and , you know
it' s not like anybody plans this ; it' s not your childhood dream .
you could be so much more .
people put you down enough , you start to believe it .
i think you are a very bright , very special woman .
the bad stuff is easier to believe .
you ever notice that ?
tell him i' il call him on monday .
yes , sir .
where you going ?
did he sign these ?
no , he said he had to leave .
edward , you can' t disappear now .
we' re in this too deep .
don' t panic , philip .
morse isn' t going anywhere .
i' il be back here in the morning .
did you send the tickets to the hotel ?
thank you .
yes , sir .
where are you going ?
i have a date .
with the hooker ?
be careful , philip .
do i look okay ?
mmm .
mmm ?
something' s missing .
well , nothin ' else is gonna fit into this dress .
i' il tell ya that .
well , maybe something in this box .
i don' t want you to get too excited .
this is only on loan .
oh !
they really let you borrow this from the jewelry store ?
i' m a very good customer .
if you were gonna buy this , how much would it cost ?
quarter of a million .
a quarter of a million dollars ?
so , where we goin ' ?
it' s a surprise .
if i forget to tell you later , i had a really good time tonight .
thank you .
when you' re not fidgeting , you look very beautiful ...
and very tall .
you' re a dream coming true [ music ]
i can' t believe how i have [ music ]
fallen for you [ music ]
you are the one [ music ]
who' s led me to the sun [ music ]
how could i know [ music ]

oh .
you' il know .
believe me , you' il understand .
the music' s very powerful .
there' s a band !
people' s reactions to opera the first time they see it is very dramatic .
they either love it or they hate it .
if they love it , they will always love it .
if they don' t , they may learn to appreciate it , but it will never become part of their soul .
mmm .
overture " to la traviata ]

everything' s done .
what else ?
you gonna leave some money by the bed when you pass through town ?
vivian , it really wouldn' t be like that .
how would it be ?
well , for one thing , it would get you off the streets .
that' s just geography .
vivian , what is it you want ?
what do you see happening between us ?
i don' t know .
when i was a little girl , my mama used to lock me in the attic when i was bad , which was pretty often .
and i would i would pretend i was a princess ... trapped in a tower by a wicked queen .
and then suddenly this knight ... on a white horse with these colors flying would come charging up and draw his sword .
and i would wave .
and he would climb up the tower and rescue me .
but never in all the time ... that i had this dream did the knight say to me ,
come on , baby , i' il put you up in a great condo .
yes .
i had to call .
i just got off the phone with james morse .
get this .
he wants to meet with you today .

he wouldn' t say .
edward , i think we got him .
his nuts are on the block .
we got him !
look , if he' s really caving in , i want to get him to commit his stocks to us this afternoon .
no , it' s no good .
if he' s really caving in , i don' t want to wait ' til this afternoon .
have morse meet me downtown this morning .
good bye .
i have to go now , but i want you to understand ...
i heard everything you said .
this is all i' m capable of right now .
it' s a very big step for me .

it was a mess .
anyway , i got the money .
thank you very much for saving my ass .

you know , he was talkin ' about you last night .
he would bust somethin ' if he saw you in this outfit .
i was afraid to hug you up there .
i might wrinkle you !
you look really good .
no , something in the shade .
over there .
you clean up real nice .
you sure don' t fit in down on the boulevard lookin ' like you do , not that you ever did .
well , thanks , but it' s easy to clean up when you got money .
yeah .
so , when does he leave ?
tomorrow .

anyway , it could work .
it happens .
when does it happen , kit ?

those were very specific cases of crackheads .
i just wanna know who it works out for .
you give me one example of somebody that we know that it happened for .
name someone ?
yeah , one person that it worked out for .
you want me to give you a name or something .
yeah .
oh , god , the pressure of a name .
cinder fuckin ' rella .
mr. morse , you said this morning you wished to speak to mr. lewis .
mr. lewis is now listening .
i' ve reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer ... on one condition .
i' m not so concerned about me , but the people who are working for me .
it' s not a problem .
they' il be taken care of .
well , then , gentlemen .

what is it you' re after now , mr. lewis ?
well , i no longer wish to buy your company and take it apart .
but i don' t want anyone else to , either .
and it is still extremely vulnerable .
so i find myself ... in unfamiliar territory .
i wanna help you .
why ?
mr. morse , i think we can do something very special with your company .
what about our navy contracts ?
ah , they weren' t dead .
just delayed .
i ... bluffed a little bit .
you' re very good at it .

you know , [ chuckles ]
this is not home .

and , uh , you are not ... the little woman .
you' re a hooker .
maybe you' re a very good hooker , you know ?
maybe if i do you , then i wouldn' t care about losing millions of dollars .
because i have to be very honest with you .
right now , vivian , right now i really do care .
i really do .
and right now i am really pissed , you know ?
right now i am just freaking out .
so maybe if i screw you , huh , and take you to the opera , then i could be a happy guy , just like edward .

this is such bullshit !
it' s the kill you love , not me !
i made you a very rich man doing exactly what you loved .
now get outta here !
get out !
why do guys always know how to hit a woman right across the cheek ?
wham !
and it feels like your eye is gonna explode .
what do they do ?
do they pull you aside in high school and show you how to do this ?
is that ow .
not all guys hit .
i heard about what you did with morse .
that was a business decision .
it was good .
it felt good .
i think this is okay .
i gotta get going .
yes , i noticed you' re packed .
why are you leaving now ?
edward , there' il always be some guy , even some friend of yours , thinkin ' he can treat me like stuckey , thinking that it' s allowed .
what are you gonna do ?
you gonna beat up everybody ?
that' s not why you' re leaving .
look , you made me a really nice offer .
