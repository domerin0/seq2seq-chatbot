no woman is worth this .
this woman is worth it .
i don' t care what it takes , i gotta win her back .
oh , really ?
she' s not gonna buy this for a second .
shut up and hand me the grapefruit !
you' re writing a comedy ?
yes , i am .
i' m writing it for you .
why would you do that ?
why would i write a play for you ?
isn' t it obvious ?
oh , i' m sorry .
i couldn' t help but overhear .
so , he took me to this fancy french restaurant ... and halfway through the hors d' oeuvres , he clutches my hand .
and that' s when he told you how he felt ?
no .
he never said it .
he never said it ?
he probably thought he didn' t need to say it .
well , then how does she know that it' s real ?
he said it was not about the words .
oh , please !
if you feel it , you say it .
it' s really very simple .
he said we' d talk about it later .
only there was no later .
it never happened .
that' s how it ended .
he just let you walk away ?
he didn' t try to save it ?
i honestly believed things might actually work out ... which was really very ...
foolish .
men .
oh , they' il give you the world ... but they let the one thing that truly matters ... slip through their fingers .
typical .
they' re so busy being brave , they forget to use their brains .
romance .
who needs it ?
## [ orchestra playing ]
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
ladies and gentlemen ...
i' m here to tell you a very strange story .
the story of our adventure ... in which 17 of our party suffered horrible deaths ... their lives lost ... in pursuit of a savage beast ... a monstrous aberration of nature .
but even the meanest brute can be tamed .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , as you will see ... the beast was no match ... for the charms of a girl .
a girl from new york ... [ audience applauding ]
who melted his heart ... bringing to mind that old arabian proverb ...
and lo , the beast looked upon the face of beauty ... " and beauty stayed his hand .
and from that day forward , he was as one dead .
and now , ladies and gentlemen , i' m going to show you ... the greatest thing your eyes have ever beheld .
he was a king in the world he knew , but he comes to you now a captive .
ladies and gentlemen ...
i give you kong , the eighth wonder of the world !
## [ music playing ]
don' t be alarmed .
it' s perfectly safe .
these chains are made of chrome steel !
observe , if you will ...
i am touching the beast .
i am actually laying my hand on the 25 foot gorilla .
crank ' em up , fellas .
and now , we have in the auditorium tonight ... a surprise guest .
the real life hero of this story .
the man who hunted down the mighty kong !
the man who risked all to win the freedom of a helpless female .
a big hand for mr. bruce baxter !
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
## [ orchestral music playing ]
he was right .
about there still being some mystery left in this world ... and we can all have a piece of it ... for the price of an admission ticket .
that' s the thing you come to learn about carl .
his unfailing ability to destroy the things he loves .
please remain calm , ladies and gentlemen ... for we now come to the climax of this savage ritual .
the sacrifice of a beautiful young girl .
behold her terror as she is offered up to the mighty kong !
a big hand , folks , for the bravest girl i' ve ever met !
miss ann darrow .
save me from the beast !
help me !
where is she ?
where' s ann ?
i have no idea .
i heard he offered her all kinds of money and she turned him down flat .
# pack up all my cares and woe #
# here i go #
# singing low #
# bye bye #
# blackbird #
# where somebody waits for me #
# sugar' s sweet #
# so is he #
# bye bye #
# blackbird ##
here' s your story , boys .
beauty and the man who saved her from the beast .
no .
we have to get these people out of here .
everyone needs to leave , okay ?

that' s it , folks .
show' s over .
step back !
clear the area .
that' s it .
shove off , boys .
why' d he do that ?
climb up there and get himself cornered .
the ape must have known what was coming .
he' s just a dumb animal .
didn' t know nothing .
what does it matter ?
airplanes got him .
it wasn' t the airplanes .
it was beauty killed the beast .
