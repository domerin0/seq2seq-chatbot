when i was a little girl , i developed early .
by the time i was 14 , i had this body you`re looking at .
can you imagine that ' i don`t want to , no .
well , needless to say , a lot of male attention .
like men , yes .
especially from our guatemalan gardener , javier . okay .
you know , javier ... before he made passionate yet gentle love to me for the first time ... he serenaded me with a beautiful old guatemalan love song .
really , that`s ....
that sounds nice . !! [ singing in spanish ]

i`ve never been more embarrassed in my life .
couldn`t get the condoms to work .
and one of them exploded on my balls .
and then her kid walked in the room .
wait .
hold up .
she was hiding the kid from you , dawg '
you know what , it doesn`t matter ... because it was going downhill straight from there .
listen , you don`t want no baby daddy drama .
trust me on this one , all right '
for all you know , he in prison right now .
let`s say y`all living together .
next thing you know , you the one going on the 1st and the 15th ... to pick up the government check .
what if he got boys that`s on the outside ... and they stalking you '
you see what l`m saying ' you got to think , partner
what the fuck are you talking about '
here`s what you do .
you tell her you`re a virgin .
you test her with this shit , okay '
here , tell me .
tell me .
this is how it`s gonna go .
tell me .
i`m a virgin .
sweet .
i like that because you don`t have chlamydia .
and i know that , and that shit is everywhere .
what if she laughs at me , though '
then you punch her in the fucking head if she laughs .
i`m not going to punch her in the head .
she`s really sweet .
no .
i mean , you punch her in her fucking head emotionally .
she`s different .
she`s someone i felt like i had ... a connection with .
all you trying to do right now is bust off this first night .
you got a whole lot of semen back up in you .
i am going to tell her .
you should totally tell her , man .
i`m going to . `cause i watched this movie called liar liar ... and the message was , ``don`t lie . ``
and that was a smart movie .
yeah , that`s the right thing .
yeah .
really ' all your girlfriends wanted to have sex with virgins , too '
that`s funny .
i didn`t even know you girls talked like that .
i think my first time might be your best time , too .
well , i knew it .
you know what ...
i knew that you`d react that way and i knew that ... you would want to lead me through my first sexual encounter ... with all the compassion and care that someone ... would give to their soul mate . oh , my god .
i`m in trouble .
hey , andy .
you watching survivortonight '
no , actually l`m going out to dinner with somebody .

what is wrong with this woman '
mercy , mercy , mercy .
i`m so sorry that happened the other night .
no , l`m sorry . oh , my god .
that was me .
no .
let me ....
i have something i want to tell you .
kind of hard to talk about .
but ... you know , there are certain things ... about who i am that ....
i`m sorry .
i just have to get this off my chest .
i am so sorry , i didn`t tell you i had kids .
yeah , what was that about '
gosh .
you know , that really surprised me .
no , you should have told me probably , but
i`m sorry .
i know .
what do i care if you have a kid '

how old are they '
six .
sixteen .
twenty one .
forty two .
fifty six .
how many kids do you have '
i have three . okay , three .
yeah , and one of them has a kid .
a one year old .
that`s cool .
that`s great .
i`m really glad we`re doing this .
me , too .
listen , andy ...
i don`t want to send you running for the hills or anything , but ...
i really feel like if we decide to do this again , then ... maybe we should hold off on the physical part for a while .
that is a fantastic idea .
why didn`t i think of that '
really ' totally .
no sex ' no .
why do that '
because here`s the thing .
from personal experience ...
i found that sex can really complicate things .
and what we should be doing right now is getting to know each other .
yeah .
well , i never thought you`d go for it .
i`m going for it .
well , that just is a great , great notion .
are you serious '
look at my face .
look at how serious i am .
can you see my nostrils '
yes .
that`s serious .
that`s more angry .
yeah , you know what , most guys would be saying : ``yeah, `` right now , but , like , by the third date , it would be : ``hey , baby , i really need to physically express how i feel`` ... and all that stuff .
well , hey , baby ... you know , three dates ....
make it 10 , 10 dates .
how about 15 '
fifteen .
screw your 15 .
20 dates . okay , 20 dates .
twenty dates . okay .
this is genius .
it`s gonna hurt .
not as much as you think .
we can really get to know each other this way .
yeah .
this is one , right ' no , next one .
is it safe to come in , or are you guys doing it '
honey , it`s safe .
great .
well , good timing .
yeah .
you remember marla .
hi , we met .
and this is my little bunny rabbit .
julia .
hey .
this is andy .
julia , how you doing '
you know what , do you by any chance like magic '
yeah .
i thought that you might .
because i noticed on the way in ... that you had something shiny behind your ear .
marla , did you see that ' something behind her ear '
you think you do ' could i check '
do you mind if i check behind your ear '
big money !
that`s amazing .
wow , it is amazing .
there`s something else , too , behind your ear , i think .
no , actually it`s not behind your ear .
i think it is your ear .
rip !
it is your ear .
there is your ear .
i ripped it off .
gross !
yeah , that`s ....
all right .
wait . okay , but that means that you ... walk around with a rubber ear in your pocket all day '
yeah , like half the time .
you know , i can come to your high school ... and do it for your friends if you want .
you know what , i should head out .
really ' yeah .
i have to give you a ride home .
right .
yes , you do .
yeah , `cause you don`t have a car or anything , right '
right , i don`t have a car . `cause he doesn`t have a car , and he does magic .
awesome .
and sarcasm is like a second language to me .
so , l`m right there with you .
but , dad ...
i don`t know how to love .
you never ... taught me how .... [ ringing ]
