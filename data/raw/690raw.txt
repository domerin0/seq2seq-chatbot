it' s very important that we get this pilot back .
we know he was taken to the local republican guard intelligence commander a man named tariq .
do you know him ?
yes , he was our commanding officer .
you know where he is ?
when the bombing started , he fled to hillah .

you said you were looking for me .
what was your plan to hide in the woods , hoping i would pass you by ?
i was going to wait until dark , then find you at your tent .
why ?
we need to keep moving .
not until you tell me where we' re moving to .
trust me .
the last time we met , you arrive to warn us the others were coming , which they weren' t .
in fact , it was a diversion to kidnap claire' s baby , so pardon me for not trusting you .
this place i' m taking you to there is something that will help you , something important .
so trust .
take this .
if i' m lying , it' s yours to use .
how much further ?
not far .
ask him where he took the pilot .
they want to know where the pilot is .
tell him his mother is a goat .
he says he does not know .
look , we know for a fact he interrogated the pilot day before yesterday hell , probably in this room .
tell him we get our man back safe and sound , he goes free .
they will let you go if you tell them where the pilot is .
you are a disgrace .
you' re an iraqi soldier !
steal his gun and kill them all .
right there on his belt .
you can get a few of them before you are killed .
what' s he saying ?
he says he does not know .
i was born , but i wasn' t born yesterday , son .
now you don' t help me out here , someone else will take over , and that someone , he won' t play nice at all .
i am sorry .
he does not know .
okay .

g uards ?

yeah , well , you got a spot of " nothin ' " on your chin , there .
dharma initiative ranch dressing .

how much further ?
danielle ?
we' re here .
and where exactly is " here " ?
what is that for , danielle ?
help me !
hey !
over here !
wait .
help !
sayid , listen to me .
hey !
aah !
over here !
please !
help me !
help me !
don' t believe a word he says .
hey !
he' s one of them .
i have no idea what she' s talking about .
she' s crazy .
how long has he been up there ?
since last night .
please , just cut me down .
my name is henry gale .
i' m from minnesota .
please .
he' s lying .
i' m going to cut him down .
don' t .
thank you .
you' re making a serious mistake .
it' s okay , it' s okay .
you' re all right .
you' re all right .
hold on .
take it easy .
oh , no .
wait !
danielle , don' t !
you could have killed him .
if i wanted to kill him , i would have killed him .
you shot this man with no provocation .
he is one of them !
tie him up .
you should take him to your doctor .
he' s no good to you dead .
and then what ?
you talk to him , sayid .
as i recall , that is what you do .
but know this he will lie .
for a long time , he will lie .
i want to talk to you about your buddy tariq .
all right , look , i get it .
you' re a man who values loyalty .
even doing a little translating for us , you feel like you' re doing the wrong thing .
i get that , and i respect it .
this is what tariq was doing before he took over command of your intelligence unit .
he was the head of a chemical warfare battalion in the north , personally supervised the use of sarin gas on this village .
you recognize it , don' t you ?
you had relatives in that village , didn' t you , sayid ?
so you know what sarin gas does .
no discrimination .
the entire marketplace .
innocent women ... children .
enough ...
please .
loyalty is a virtue , but unquestioning loyalty
i don' t think that' s you .
why should i believe you ?
how do you think we knew you had relatives in that village ?
we liberated your personnel file and tariq' s .
all we want is our pilot back , so we can send him home to his family .
tariq will never talk to you .
that' s why you' re gonna have to make him talk to you .
john .
john , wake up .
what ?
come out here .
minnesota , huh ?
that' s the question , isn' t it ?
where am i ?
who are you ?
henry .
henry gale .
aah !
my back !
we' re going to take it out , but first i want you to relax .
how did you get to this island ?
four months ago , we crashed , my wife and i.
crashed in what ?
a balloon .
we were trying to cross the pacific .
your wife where is she ?
she died .
she got ... she got sick three weeks ago .
we were staying in a cave off the beach .
my shoulder .
at least untie my arms !
what the hell is going on here ?
rousseau trapped him in the jungle .
she believe she' s an other .
an " other " what ?
you shot him with an arrow ?
do i have a bow ?
hey , hey , you with me ?
what , you were just gonna let him bleed to death ?
i was trying to get honest answers while he was able to give them ... and his wound is far from life threatening .
we should let jack treat him first , then we' il get our answers .
jack ... do not untie him .
this is how people get killed in scary movies .
if it were a scary movie , i' d be with a hot chick , not you , barbar .
it' s babar .
how about you shut up , hammo , or your ranch disorder' s gonna be the new lead item on the coconut internet .
fine .
go ahead .
tell everyone the fat guy' s been hiding ranch dressing , the fat guy who likes to eat .
yeah , i' m fat .
fat , fat , fat , fat , fat .
you think i don' t know that ?
at least people like me .
you know what ?
find the damn frog by yourself .
hurley , wait !
wait !
hey , hurley !
look , man , i' m sorry , all right ?
this frog is killin ' me .
you gotta help me out ...
please .
so what do you think ?
what do you think , john ?
i think he' s pretty convincing .
yes , he is .
the real problem is there' s no way we can be sure he' s telling the truth .
that is not necessarily true .
does jack have the combination to the armory ?
for now , he does .
how long would it take for you to change it ?
if you' re angry ,
looking for someone to punish ...
why would i need to punish anyone ?
i want to find out who he is .
i want the truth .
and i think we both know that jack will have issues with what must be done in order to get it .
so how long , john , to change the combination ?
a couple minutes , tops .
then i suggest you get started .
did he say anything while you were treat
no , he didn' t .
he was in shock .
we can' t just leave him layin ' here , jack .
people will see him and create a panic .
yeah ?
well , where do you think we should put him ?
i say we put him in the armory .
it' s secure .
better to err on the side of safety , jack , at least until we can be sure .
okay .
for now .
all right , pull that cot in here .
he shouldn' t be on his back .
good idea .
sayid !
hey , what the hell you doin ' ?
what needs to be done .
they' re letting speak to me alone now ?
you need to tell me where the helicopter pilot is .
this is their new bluff ?
that you' re going to torture me ?
they think you will do this ?
sayid , you are a loyal soldier .
the son of a great hero .
do not disgrace your father !
you wouldn' t dare harm me !
you will follow my orders as your commanding officer !
take that bag .
put it over your head and tape it up .
kill yourself , now !
that' s an order .
do it and die with what little honor you have left .
you would have me take my own life ... the information means nothing to you !
the pilot was executed two days ago .
he is buried in a field 4 kilometers from here .
i can take you there .
damn it .
sayid , open the door !
sayid , answer me !
jack .
why isn' t this combination working , john ?
did you change it ?
yeah .
why would you do that ?
you' re raising an army .
what ?
and why you didn' t ask me to help , well , that' s your business , but there' s only one reason to raise an army , jack , and that' s because we' re at war .
and like it or not , whatever sayid has to do behind that door , that' s a part of it , too .
what if he' s telling the truth , john ?
what if he' s not ?
get up .
what' s happening ?
here , let me help you .
you said you' ve been here for four months .
what ?
you said you came to this island four months ago , yes ?
where am i ?
please answer my question .
yeah yes , we landed four months ago , maybe more .
who are you ?
and you were in a cave for all that time ?
off the beach ... on the north shore of the island .
how far from this beach to where you were captured ?
i don' t know .
how many days ' walk ?
two two days .
why did you stay on the beach for so long ?
why wouldn' t we ?
we wanted to be there for flyovers .
we had an emergency beacon a transmitter .
what kind of transmitter ?
an a. d. f. beacon .
we wanted to make sure we' d be spotted .
look , whatever you think i am , i' m not .
please please just ... tell me your name .
you wife what is her maiden name ?
murphy .
where did you meet her ?
university of minnesota .
how did she die ?
she got sick .
she got sick ?
it started as a fever .
after two days , she was delirious ... then she died .
i don' t know why you' re asking me all these questions .
i don' t know why you' re treating me this way ... why i have to explain to you who i am when you don' t tell me who you are .
i was 23 years old when the americans came to my country .
i was a good man .
i was a soldier ... and when they left ,
i was something different .
for the next six years ,
i did things i wish i could erase from my memory , things which i never thought myself to be capable of ... but i did come to learn this there is a part of me which was always capable .
you want to know who i am ?
my name is sayid jarrah ... and i am a torturer .
where is it ?
there it is .
gotcha .
dude , nice catch .
well , i' il be damned .
all that noise from this tiny critter .
kind of reminds me of a turtle i once had .
his name was stewart .
he ran off when i was 10 .
well , that' s what mom said .
i kinda think she threw him out .
well , you' re a happy little fella , ain' t ya ?
i have an idea .
why don' t i take him far from here , two beaches away ?
maybe i' il finda mrs.
tree frog .
that way , he won' t keep you up anymore , and everyone' s happy .
yeah , that' s one idea .
here' s another .
dude .
i hear with a little ranch , they taste just like chicken .
give you a hand ?
jack , i know this  shut up .
where are the pliers ?
tell me about this balloon .
what ?
this balloon that brought you here with your wife tell me about it .
what do you want to know ?
everything .
she' s 140 feet high , 60 feet wide ... and when she' s up in the air , 550, 000 cubic feet of helium and 100, 000 of hot air keep her up .
and if you could look down on her , you' d see a big , yellow smiley face on top .
why would you travelin that way ?
because i was rich , because ... it was my dream ...
and jennifer thought it would be neat .
you were rich .
i guess i' m thinking of things in the past tense now .
how' s that for optimism ?
what did you do to become so rich ?
i sold my company .
what kind of company ?
mining .
what did you mine ?
we mined nonmetallic minerals .
i know , everyone wanted to talk to me at cocktail parties .
give me your hands .
give me your hands !
where is she buried ?
what ?
listen to me .
you said you buried your wife .
tell me where .
what are you gonna  wwhere ? !
in the jungle !
by the balloon , in the jungle .
how deep ?
how deep did you dig the grave ?
i don' t ...
how deep ?
how many shovelfuls of earth ?
did you use your hands ?
how long did it take you ? !
i don' t remember !
you would remember !
you would remember how deep !
you would remember every shovelful , every moment !
you would remember what it felt like to place her body inside .
you would remember if you buried the woman you loved .
you would remember , if it were true !
did you ... did you lose someone ?
did you lose someone here on the island ?
did you lose someone , too ?
what happened to her ?
it was an accident .
it was an accident .
the woman responsible thought she was someone else , someone coming to hurt her .
someone like you !
just just this is all a mistake .
slow down here , okay ?
hurting me isn' t gonna bring her back .
you know what i lost !
tell me the truth !
tell me who you are !
no !
no !
no !
help !
stop !
tell me the truth !
tell me who you are !
sayid !
sayid !
jack .
open it .
open it now .
jack , this has to happen .
open that damn door , you understand me ? !
you open it now !
no .
now !
what do you want me to say ? !
whatever you want me to do , i' il do it !
just please ...
i want you to tell me the truth !
open the door .
let go of me , jack .
or what ?
you want to pushthe button ?
open the door .
it' s under a minute now , john .
you better think fast .
you wouldn' t .
what ?
i wouldn' t what ?
if we don' t ... you would risk everyone' s lives ?
you talked me into pushing that button once , john , but it' s yours now .
you' re the onewho won' t risk it , you .
me ?
i don' t think anything' s gonna happen when we get down to zero .
jack ...
you want to see what' s gonna happen ?
let' s just see what' s gonna happen .
who are you ? !
who are you ? !
okay , okay , okay , right , 15 , left
you think i' m stupid ?
you open it !
he' s lying !
not like this !
i' il tell you whatever you want !
he' s lying !
he' s lying !
that' s enough !
what the hell was that ?
he is one of them .
yeah ?
did he tell you that ?
no .
then how do you know ?
because i know .
he is one of them .
i think that' s what rousseau thought about you once , sayid .
if i' m not mistaken , she strapped you down , she shocked you , all because she thought you were one of them .
he is .
what ?
he is one of them .
to rousseau , we' re all " others .
i guess it' s all relative , huh ?
you got a wife ?
kids ?
i' il take him .
it' s over .
we' re pulling out , not going to baghdad .
so your man saddam gets to stay in power , which means you , in all likelihood , will remain in his employ .
guess you' re lucky to have a new skill set you can use .
what you made me do , no human being should ever have to do to another .
one of these days ... there will be something you need to know .
and now ... you know how to get it .
i will never do that again .
yeah .
good luck to you , sayid .
bus fare back to ramadi .
let' s move out .
there is a man down in the hatch ... a stranger captured by rousseau .
i beat him .
i beat him badly .
why are you telling me this , sayid ?
jack asked me how i knew knew for sure that this man was lying , how i knew for sure that he was one of them , one of the others .
i know because i feel no guilt for what i did to him .
but there is no way i can ever explain that to jack or even locke ... because both of them have forgotten .
forgotten ?
what ?
that you were strung up by your neck and left for dead , that claire was taken and kept for days , during which god only knows what happened to her , that these people , these " others " , are merciless ... and can take any one of us whenever they choose .
so tell me , charlie .
have you forgotten ?
