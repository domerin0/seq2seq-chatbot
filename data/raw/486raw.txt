excuse me !
let' s go !
let' s go !
step back !
go , go , go , go !
move !
move !
what' s going on ?
sir , stay down .
the russian scientists have been working on a bomb .
nuclear .
it arrived in baltimore this morning .
get those people out of the stadium !
we' re on it !
stay down !
all we know is , the president has been taken off ...
all set .
thanks, j. j.
clearly something has happened of tremendous proportion .
we have no word yet or confirmation as to what ... but there is an enormous cloud over ...
go , go , go !
come with me !
mr. president !
mr. president !
are you all right ?
he' s stuck !
he' s stuck !
get out of the way !
mr. president , are you all right ?
are you all right , mr. president ?
the marines will take you home , sir .
i need your help , danny .
alvarez , get me a stretcher !

you got the stretcher ?
you got the stretcher ?
no , i don' t want one .
okay .

let' s go !
move it !
move it , move it !
go , go !
close the mouth !
got ' em !
hey !
it' s ryan !
jack , where are you ?
i don' t know .
somewhere outside baltimore .
cabot got the president out .
where' s the president now ?
they' re taking him airborne .
he' s on naoc .
why ?
they think it may be the russians .
it wasn' t the russians .
i gotta talk to cabot .
can you patch me through to the plane ?
cabot' s not aboard .
we don' t know where he is .
can you call back in an hour ?
we don' t have an hour !
fowler will want to show how tough he is .
he' s gonna hit back , now !
listen to me .
we must prove it wasn' t the russians before he' s convinced it is .
can you get back to langley ?
there' s no time !
there must be a command post on site .
the radiation assessment team ... where are they ?
stambler tunnels , south of the city .
stambler tunnels , south of the city .
the prevailing winds are blowing the fallout from east to north .
as long as you stay south , you' re okay .
mr. president , are you all right ?
how the hell do you think i am ?
how many casualties ?
we don' t know .
cabot said it was russian .
how did it get in there ?
we don' t know .
radar didn' t pick it up , so it wasn' t a missile .
how is cabot ?
where is he ?
i don' t know .
well , what do you know ?
i don' t know !
all right .
i don' t know , for christ' s sake !
general , prozain and kondor are not on board .
mr. president , i recommend that we move to defcon 2 .
where' s our intelligence ?
russian air defenses have moved to their highest level .
maybe they' re afraid of an attack .
i can' t get this goddamned chair to open !
sir , defcon status ?
we' re about to take off .
we don' t know who did it .
we think russia' s at high alert .
excuse me .
you think ?
sir ?
defcon 2 ?
we' re groping in the dark ...
this is too much goddamn bullshit !
not enough fact .
the blast crater is about 100 , maybe 140 yards wide ... which suggests a relatively low yield device .
quite a bit smaller than , say , the hiroshima bomb .
maybe a quarter of a square mile around the stadium is just gone .
beyond that , buildings remain ... although heavily damaged for another quarter mile or so .
the damage appears to taper off further away from ground zero .
herr haft has left for america .
and now we are counting on you .
i assure you , i will earn every pfennig .
the ash isn' t radioactive , and winds are blowing the fallout to sea .
jack ryan , cla .
lorna shiro .
you need to wait outside with everybody else .
i don' t think so .
i need to know everything you know about the bomb .
look , pal , we' re collecting samples and analyzing the debris ... so take a number , get in line , and we' il have the report tomorrow .
captain , i don' t have time for this .
where did this bomb come from ?
i' il settle for where it didn' t come from , but i need to know now ... otherwise there may not be a tomorrow .
shit .
wesson , where are you ?
about a quarter mile from ground zero .
i think this is about as far as we go .
our feet are sizzling .
i' m getting rads here nearly the limit of our gear .
okay , cut the rover loose and get the hell out of there .
roger that .
the crate the bomb was shipped in ... somebody signed for it at the port .
customs must have a database .
get me a name .
and where' s cabot ?
no one knows .
we' re checking the hospitals .
have you tried memorial ?
he wouldn' t be there .
no , i mean , is it still ...
it' s cathy' s hospital .
as far as i know it' s still there .
but the phones are down .
can you keep checking for me ?
thanks .
they could' ve launched a cruise missile .
dsp sats might' ve missed it .
we don' t know this is russia .
but we don' t know it' s not .
if they were sending us a message , like " stay out of chechnya " ... the whole point would be for us to know it was them .
except that they could inspire the confusion we' re going through now .
mr. president , we' re uplinked .
president nemerov , a short time ago ... there was a major nuclear event on the eastern seaboard of the us .
loss of life is severe .
it was no accident .
it was not an accident .
we don' t yet know where it came from , we don' t ...
we have not yet ascertained the source of this weapon .
rest assured ...
whoa , that was a little fast .
please accept the deepest sympathies of the russian people .
if it was deliberate , this is a crime without precedent .
what madman would do such a thing , and for what purpose ?
you must believe russia had nothing to do with this infamous act .
it' s canned .
they prepared that in advance .
president nemerov , we have no reason to suspect russian involvement ... at this time .
tao , ew .
i' m picking up intermittent radar bearing 020 .
where ?
now it' s gone .
there !
it' s a weak signal .
low on the horizon .
tao , alr sup .
inbound contact !
multiples on the same bearing !
vampire !
vampire !
fast movers inbound !
i got seven , eight ... nine of them !
the missiles came from russian aircraft .
grennel thinks he can save the ship , but flight ops are definitely out .
... until we investigate all possibilities .
like you did in chechnya ?
mr. president , who is in control of your armed forces ?
mr. president ... we are now at a de facto state of war with the russians .
john clark was in haifa yesterday .
i don' t know where he is today , but he may have something .
find him .
check out that gadolinium reading .
yeah , the mass fraction is huge .
okay , connect me to dillon .
i' il hold .
there it is .
savannah river .
oh , yeah .
" oh , yeah " what ?
always had that gadolinium problem .
hanford does it another way .
they always generate too much promethium .
hold on .
can you translate that into english ?
this plutonium came from the doe plant at savannah river ...
february of' 68 , from " k " reactor .
you can even tell which part of " k " reactor .
wait , this is our plutonium ?
made in the usa .
you gotta find cabot .
are you advocating we launch a first strike ?
it is not a first strike !
there' s already been a first strike , and a second !
don' t you get it ?
no , i don' t !
i don' t understand why we have to nuke them !
it' s not reasonable !
sidney , goddamn it !
they practically sank an aircraft carrier !
their missile silos are hot .
we' re getting nothing but bullshit from nemerov .
and let' s not forget how this thing started .
they tried to kill me !
remember ?
so don' t fucking tell me to be reasonable .
sir ?
sir .
what ?
the president .
the president' s fine .
he' s fine .
the bomb .
the plutonium was ...
wife .
what ?
wife .
your wife .
i' m sure she' s fine .
she' s in dc .
the blast radius wasn' t that ... wasn' t that wide .
here .
sir , now listen to me .
the plutonium was ours .
john clark' s in haifa right now trying to find the arms dealer .
i can' t get a hold of him ... and i don' t know what to do .
girlfriend .
she works in baltimore , so ...
i don' t know .
spinnaker .
what ?
spinnaker .
sir ?
bill ?
yeah, jack , just got in .
we found the receiver address for the crate .
yeah , port of baltimore .
can you get to the docks ?
yeah .
find the trans con warehouse .
the name on the manifest is mason .
sorry , i need this truck .
come on .
shit .
come on !
we' ve come up with an alternative .
we' il counterforce .
a conventional attack on the russian air base ... where the carrier attack originated .
it' s what we' re looking for ... a measured response .
nonnuclear .
is it strong enough ?
smart bombs and f 16s .
pretty goddamn strong .
can' t afford for them to see us as weak .
they' ve gotta know we have the guts to take it to the next level .
i think they' il get that message .
hit ' em .
eagle' s nest , this is eagle one .
we have target acquired .
target is lit .
good bye .
everyone , can i have your attention ?
the generator has gone out .
i don' t want anyone to move because there' s broken glass everywhere .
we' il get back to you ...
good .
okay , stay where you are .
we' re going to get you one by one .
sir , can you hear me ?
can you feel your arms and legs ?
a 9 % iv and morphine drip .
we' re gonna take care of you .
what do you got ?
what do we do with the ones we know won' t make it ?
whatever we can .
what ?
bill cabot died .
i' m really sorry .
this can' t be happening .
sir , you have a call from langley .
thank you .
becker .
this is jack ryan , russian desk .
oh , great .
the nemerov apologist .
sir , this bomb was not nemerov .
i know this guy .
that' s what you said after grozny , mr. ryan .
put it in your report .
the plutonium came from ...
seems unusual to find radiation poisoning all the way out here .
i have never myself seen such a thing .
that is why we published the case on the internet ... to seek help .
how did he say it happened ?
he will not talk about it .
was anyone else exposed to the materials that made you sick ?
mr. ghazi , i' m not the police .
i' m a physician .
anything you say to me stays between us .
my friend and i ... find bomb .
we sell ... to man who buys such things .
was it this man ?
other people may have come in contact with that bomb .
i am ... going to die ... yes ?
yes .
his name ... is olson .
he lives in damascus .
oh , yeah .
we' re getting it all .
mr. president , we need you to initiate snapcount .
what happens then ?
we prepare to take out their land based missiles ... with a massive nuclear strike ... find and kill their subs ... knock out whatever planes they have on the ground ... and mobilize to destroy the ones they already have in the air .
what are our chances ?
david ?
odds are ... we leave nemerov in a pretty pickle .
he' il be left with , at best , a few hundred nukes ... the ones we can' t find .
mostly the smaller , more mobile , less accurate kind .
all he can do with those is target our cities .
but he knows to an absolute certainty ... that we will respond against his cities .
i spent my entire adult life wanting to be president .
this is my presidency .
sir , i believe he' il keep his 300 nukes .
it' s still a credible deterrent against some future aggressor .
he' il push back from the table and call it a night .
i' m giving the order for snapcount .
maximum readiness .
jack , we' re in olson' s files .
he shows wire payments of $45 million from someone named dressler .
dillon , run dressler .
find out who he is .
jack , i want you out of there .
i' m at the docks .
somebody' s here .
try to find the name " dressler .
no !
jack , get out of there .
dillon , call the baltimore pd , give them the address .
hurry .
jack , wait for the cops .
i' il call you back .
wait .
who' s dressler ?
huh ?
where is he , goddamn it ?
where is dressler ?
police !
get your hands up !
where' s dressler ?
are you jack ryan ?
where' s dressler ?
tell me !
let him go .
let him go .
where' s dressler ?
where is he ?
langley said you might need some help .
i gotta get to the pentagon .
i think i can help you with that .
the russians are scrambling their fighters .
we are out of time .
he has a heart condition .
get a doctor .
mr. president .
david , where' s your nitro ?
i said get a doctor in here !
mr. president .
take him to my quarters .
bring him the launch codes .
okay , dressler' s an austrian manufacturer , a billionaire .
his father was executed at nuremberg .
five years ago he bought himself a seat in parliament .
then he got himself booted out for saying nice things about the nazis .
get me the president .
i can' t .
come on !
get me through !
they' re into snapcount .
there' s no way in .
bullshit !
i can do that for you .
no , it' s fine .
got some dirt on the card .
may i see that card , sir ?
we' re on a high alert .
put the card down , please .
back off .
i am ordering you ...
hold on .
take a step back , now !
i am ordering you to take a step back immediately , sir .
general , there' s a dr. ryan from the cla .
he wants to enter nmcc .
he' s unescorted , sir .
what' s he want ?
you , sir .
sir , my name is jack ryan .
i have an urgent message from director cabot ... that i need to transmit over the hot line immediately .
what' s your authorization ?
i don' t have an authorization .
then where' s cabot ?
cabot' s dead , sir .
i just need to get this information sent .
please .
not without authorization .
get him out of here .
wait a minute !
general !
the president' s basing his decisions on some really bad information ... and if you shut me out ... your family and my family and 25 million other families ... will be dead in 30 minutes !
my orders are to get the right information ... to the people who make the decisions .
i just need to send some information .
what makes you think the president will even listen to you ?
he doesn' t have to .
you have about a minute for the launch sequence to process ... after you give the order .
before the order can be taken , an id check must be performed .
mine is the ...
my number is the ... third number down from the top .
your order , sir ?
strike .
i' m sorry , sir ?
i give the order to strike .
under the two man rule , the order to strike must now be confirmed .
bob , for the love of god ...
just do it .
sidney owens , secretary of state .
it' s the fourth number down .
the order to strike has now been confirmed by the two man rule .
nmcc , this is lasseter .
the strike order has been confirmed .
start the sequence .
we' ve got activity on the hot line .
they' ve had their chance .
somebody' s talking to the kremlin .
as you can imagine ... there has been much confusion here ... and fear .
but we know the weapon was not russian .
we know the weapon was not russian .
repeat .
the weapon was not russian .
what the hell is going on ?
who are we talking to ?
ryan .
i met you in moscow with bill cabot .
he died today in baltimore .
cut him off .
we can' t .
launch sequence has begun .
two months ago , a neo fascist named dressler ... bought an a bomb on the black market .
cut him off .
you can' t .
that' s the whole idea .
then get somebody to stop him .
he paid three disaffected russian scientists ...
to make the bomb active .
he shipped it to the us , where a man named mason ... " was hired to deliver the bomb to the target ... and set our countries on a collision course .
what are you asking of me ?
back down .
what guarantee do i have that president fowler will follow suit ?
none .
sir , i know you .
i know you had nothing to do with the baltimore bomb ... and you sure as hell know you didn' t .
but you' re still about to launch a nuclear strike against us .
yes , sir .
it' s no longer about baltimore .
now it' s about our fears .
that' s all , dr. ryan .
move away .
fear of being weak , of mistakes .
fear of the other guy that built these bombs in the first place !
it stopped .
thirty seconds to launch .
oh , my god .
mr. president .
we will maintain our defensive alert for the moment ... but our offensive forces are withdrawn .
if you match our move , i propose a phased mutual stand down ... over the next five hours .
stop the launch sequence .
lasseter here .
flash override .
stop the sequence .
stop the sequence .
order the planes to stand down .
take us to defcon 3 .
and would somebody ask mr. ryan if i can use the phone now ?
you' re still here .
there is no more fitting memorial ... for those who perished in this tragedy ... than the steps we have taken this week ... toward a multinational campaign ... to root out and eliminate weapons of mass destruction .
we embark upon this course ... because we have finally learned , at far too great a cost ... that if the most powerful weapons ever created are unleashed ... they will be fired not in anger , but in fear .
dr. ryan .
mr. grushkov .
it is a lovely day .
yeah .
oh , i' m sorry .
this is ...
dr. muller .
how do you do ?
nice to meet you .
why am i not surprised that you know her name ?
our friend william thought i was a spy .
of course , he could never prove it .
he never told me you were friends .
perhaps he didn' t know you well enough .
cabot did tell me he had a source in russia .
to keep the back channels open ?
in hopes of staving off disaster .
president kennedy said , " our most basic common link ... is that we all inhabit this small planet .
we all breathe the same air .
we all cherish ... our children' s future .
and we are all mortal .
i will miss ... so very much talking to william .
me too .
perhaps ... from time to time ... you and i can talk .
i' d like that .
what is this ?
a modest gift ... for your engagement .
he just asked me this morning .
we haven' t told anybody about ...
how did you ...
how could you possibly know ?
