i have no choice
the number ?
it' s on the phone
i' m causing you a lot of trouble
you weren' t to know
in the meantime i' il make that police report
the car may never be found so i may as well say it was parked in a street
so your vehicle was parked on rue davot
where in the street ?
near number 22
and there was some gear in it
and ... my luggage
but it was ... properly parked !
here in le guilvinec
of course i locked it .
of course i locked it !
no , please ...
just a minute , mr. letour
i wanted ... one more thing
i' m allowed to stretch my legs !
but ... of course the shoes were in it !
that' s what i don' t know !
i have no idea
you tell me !
okay , i get it
okay , no problem !
no problem , yeah ...
fuck you !
i guess i' m out of a job
it wasn' t me !
he' il be okay
don' t worry , he' il be up and about in a week
he' il be fine
so you mean ... there' s no problem ?
it' s just that ...
i left in a hurry this morning
i didn' t want to go away without thanking you
i wanted to say ...
i wanted to say ...
yes ?
you wanted to say what ?
nothing special .
just ... to thank you , i thought maybe ...
i could take you out to dinner but maybe it' s not ...
that' s really kind .
roland ?
fancy dinner tonight ?
yeah , great !
oh no , i can' t tonight .
i' il grab a few cds and get going
you were saying about your wife ...
my wife and i are in the process of separating ... maybe
we decided to give each other a month of total freedom without any contact , for any reason
one month ?
we meet again in three weeks to decide if we should go back and live together ... carry on as a couple ... or go our separate ways
it' s a way of ... testing the feelings we have ... for each other
obviously i can' t go home
obviously not , under the circumstances
what' s your name ?
marinette
i' m paco
paco cazale .
i heard you on the phone
you' re spanish ?
no , catalan
and your wife ?
she' s catalan too
no , i mean ... her first name .
it' s important .
your name can change your life
is roland ... ?
you mean ...
roland' s my brother
why ?
just wondering
he could have been ...
my husband
is marriage important to you ?
no , no ...
i mean yes
i have a small question to ask you
do you actually prefer crayfish or crepes ?
crepes
it figures
it' s pretty here
very pretty
i must be out of my mind !
i don' t know you ...
mind the water
that' s my car !
what will you do ?
i don' t know
i have to find out if the little thief locked the car
like i told the police
and then you' il go ?
i don' t know
you can stay tonight too , if you like
i hit you a bit hard
it' s understandable .
you were very angry
thanks , anyway
what for ?
the police didn' t come
i' il tell you where your car is
okay .
by the way ...
did you happen to lend it to someone ?
who would i lend it to ?
and you locked it ?
you know , i don' t own much , so ...
i' m not in the habit
the keys are in my pocket
so i' ve got the keys
that' s something
you know , stealing cars is not in my philosophy
something got into me when i saw all those shoes
a crazy urge to drive off in the car
i don' t know ...
i didn' t go far
you found me here
don' t worry
you won' t get into trouble and you' il soon be out
you' re a good sport
if i' d known ...
listen , i' il tell you the truth
i borrowed your car to seduce a woman
to seduce a woman ?
as i don' t have much luck with women
i wanted to seduce them by pretending
i have a job , nice car , the works
i even took it to the car wash so it' s not like i damaged it
you know , give a woman a nice pair of shoes always makes her happy !
i managed to stay the night with her but it didn' t work out
i slept at her place , yeah , but on the couch
early next morning she asked me to ... get out
that' s funny
why ?
because ...
i also spent that night with a woman , also on the couch
in fact , i met her thanks to you
are you in love ?
i think so
so ?
what ?
nothing
like that ?
like that ... or like this
i got you a glass
what will you say if you see your wife ?
do you want to live with her again ?
actually , i' m not married
i lied to you a little
why ?
because it was ... too complicated
the truth is i split up with my girlfriend and there' s no way i' m going back to her
why did you make up that story ?
i didn' t think about it
i thought if i was married i' d have more chance that you would believe me and trust me , in the middle ... of all that hassle
i wanted so much ... to stay with you
i wanted it ... really sincerely
sometimes you can tell the truth more easily with lies
all right ?
i have something to tell you
something difficult ... and delicate ... so i preferred to write it down
can i read it now ?
paco , the day we met you touched me , made me laugh and surprised me
something strong happened
i fell in love with you before i knew it
i don' t want to be hurt .
i fell in love suddenly once before and he was unfaithful .
our relationship was doomed
i' m afraid it' il happen again with you
everything' s moving too fast
i have a suggestion .
i' il tell you the truth without lies
i' d rather you left , paco .
make your lie come true
we give ourselves three weeks of freedom no contact whatsoever
then , if you want , we' il meet again
have affairs , if you must , before we live togetherif we do
i' m not a onenight woman .
i need time
three weeks apart with no contact , whatever happens
then we' il know if we really want to meet again
this marinette you see again in three weeks ?
it' s all i think about
till then , you got nothing special to do ?
how about we hit the road together ?
if you want , of course hit the road ?
me , i' m on the road .
it' s not always easy , but ... if you want , we can hit the road together
all right ?
mister ?
can i open the window ?
go ahead
what' s that little ... fir tree ?
you know ?
i see thing like that ... everywhere these days
it' s a " magic tree " .
for the smell
smells good , eh ?
i' il let you out here .
i turn right
can' t we stop here ?
what you want in this hole ?
there' s nothing
we can sleep here and go on tomorrow
no , to sleep ... we need to get to pont l' abbe .
is okay there
there' s a hotel here
it' s not for me
come on , it' s a crummy hotel
look , i ...
i can' t afford it
don' t worry .
it' s on me
listen , for me is ... homeless shelters ... dodges ...
once or twice a month , a year ...
what you call it ?
youth hostel
i can' t afford it
i told you , it' s on me .
i' il pay
it won' t cost much anyway
don' t worry .
we get to pont l' abbe
i' il swing it .
i' m used to it
i' m not waiting here for hours to get some ... weirdo
we stink to hell , nino !
i want a wash
ten more minutes !

how does it feel ?
how does it feel to be on the road ?
to be here ?
i feel like a chump who had his car pinched ... and his job
can i take a cigarette ?
eat , before it gets cold
most of all i feel like ... a guy who has a chick on his brain and doesn' t know what to do
i' m not going to sponge on you .
i can take care of myself
i know
in any case ...
listen , i' m going for a leak and then i' m going to bed

one week before the wedding , she disappeared like smoke
so i lost the taste for stability
you have any questions , ask them .
i' m not gonna spend days and nights talking about it
did you never see her again ?
never
never , never , never .
i tried everything
she vanished ... like that
maybe she thought she took a wrong turn and wanted the little russian out of her life
why didn' t you go back home to russia ?
because i looked too stupid
i left like a king
imagine all my family , my friends ...
good luck nino !
i was ashamed
i never think of going back to face my folks
maybe one day , if i have the guts
we' re not getting far today

we' re not getting very far
i had an idea .
you interested in that waitress last night ?
waitress ?
why ?
she asked us to dinner tonight
we' d have a place to sleep and i was thinking ...

she said she' d invite another girlfriend so maybe we could turn around and go back as we' re not getting very far

don' t shout at her
why you girls all around the world the same ?
why ?
tell me !
say something !
you not capable of any deep feelings ?
i tell you .
deep feelings ... deep feelings to you are like greek
and then you have the gall to complain that you' re not understood !
you' re only interested in goodlooking guys
you don' t know how to look at a man
simply a man
feel and see what is inside him ... simply inside him
you know why ?
you want i tell you why ?
because you only interested in appearance !
fucking goddamn shit !
simply ...
sorry , paco .
i spoiled your evening
you' re my pal , i spoiled your evening but not on purpose
there' s a good example
a lady .
simply ... simply sitting
look how she' s sitting .
simply
there' s no strength , no fucking strength
sorry i say " fucking " and " goddamn shit " but me being a foreigner , i learn here in france several words : " fucking " , " goddamn shit " , " go to hell
sorry , lady .
you have beautiful eyes
and that' s the truth
can' t we stop ?
if we' re hitching there' s no point walking
you see that town ?
i see it
i' m sure , in that town , there has to be a woman for you
a woman who loves you but doesn' t know it yet
i' m even sure ... that in every single town in france there' s at least one woman who' d love you if she knew you
i mean at least one !
one is the minimum
so in all the towns in france ...
think about it .
add them all up
it' s crazy .
the potential is enormous !
the only problem with that town is how to meet her
she' s there so we cross the river !
but to meet her , to meet her ... we have to locate her so that you can meet
and you will .
you know what we' il do ?
i have an idea
we' il do an opinion poll
opinion poll ?
we' il make up a questionnaire and pretend we' re doing a poll about women .
for a newspaper , for instance
so we can question women without making them suspicious
now , important ...
the subject of the poll .
we' il tell them it' s a poll about the ideal man
that way , we' il know right away which woman suits you the best ... appeals to you the most ... ... and is almost sure to like you
that' s how we locate her
that' s it
but wait .
are you sure this ... poll is reliable ?
reliable , yes ... if we ask the right questions ... and find the single women
you list the girls ' names up to " p " , i' il do the rest
get the addresses , too
i have an idea for a question .
how about this ?
do you want ... for a woman to like philosophy in men ?
no , that' s not it
if she likes men ... who like philosophy ?
that' s it
i thought about another one
does your ideal man necessarily have to be french ?
that' s damn good
do you like russians ?
no , we can' t ask if they like russians .
it' s too direct
do you like fat men ?
what' s your questionnaire , guys ?
looks interesting
tell him
it' s a questionnaire for women
about the ideal man
wide subject
can i ask you something ?
go ahead
what' s your name ?
baptiste
nice to meet you
nino , russian from ltaly
ask your question !
paco , spanish from catalonia
great
ivory coaster from brittany
how did you meet your girlfriend ?
that' s easy .
by playing " good morning france
what' s the matter ?
good morning france " ?
i know .
i saw on tv one day ...
no , it' s a game i made up with some pals
it' s fun .
it goes like this
there are three of us , all at separate tables
got it ?
somebody walks by
if it' s my turn , i say " good morning
if he says " good morning " back , i score a point
if he doesn' t ...
okay
why " france " ?
because the passersby are french
we' re not french
who cares ?
anyone can play
not everyone in france is french .
if it' s a girl you get two points
that' s good
good morning !
' morning
i get a point
do kids count ?
no
good morning !
zero
one point for me check out the dog !
he scores three points .
get it ?
go back where you belong
i already am
no points for me , obviously !
good morning , girls
that makes four
not three ?
three for you
i' m in the lead
good morning france !
have to take the stairs .
the elevator' s down
never mind let' s go
wait a second .

i' m going to ask you something .

the evening before you go
preferably a tuesday or thursday , when the kids are at my sister' s
hi !
sit down
this is my friend antoine
all set !
it' s been arranged .
two beds for two nights
the shelter manager is nice , eh ?
yeah , we talked .
he' s a cool guy
do you think ... he would lend me some money till the wire comes through ?
do they do that ?
he can ask , yeah ?
the effect she has on me ... is incredible
you' ve really got to see her
what about marinette ?
i' m all mixed up
she still matters enormously ... and all this is because of her
god , this woman is ...
and she intimidates me , you know ?
she has a personality ...
i don' t know ...
something ... incredible
can you write ?
what ?
can you write ?
of course i can write
i don' t mean that
can you write fancy sentences , phrases ?
yeah , why ?
help me write a letter for antoine , okay ?
maybe you could start by ... giving him your news .
tell him how things are going
i think he wants to say , " dad , it' s no good .
i feel bad
you can' t start a letter with " dad , it' s no good
why not ?
i think it' s an okay start
dad , it' s no good ...
what do you think , antoine ?
it' s not a bad start
i don' t know
i don' t think much of it
suggest something else
what do you want , antoine ?
what i want is impossible
yeah , but ... if it was possible , what would you want ?
if it was possible , i' d want to go home
that' s where he lives there ?
i' ve been thinking .
it' s better if ...
it' s not so good if we both go
we need one person who looks respectable
you could be right
in that jacket ...
you have a jacket too .
you go
no , wait !
look , mine' s not very smart
it' s fine .
it' s better if you go
you know antoine better and you know the hard life
is antoine' s dad in ?
good morning ...
it' s about antoine ...
are you his father ?
yes .
is he in trouble ?
no , no
it' s a letter ... from antoine to you
i just came to deliver it
a letter ?
he never wrote to me before
you know it' s very hard to be separated from someone you want to be with , especially when it' s your father
he mucked around .
he made his choice
yes , but ... mucking around can sometimes help you see more clearly
i won' t have him setting a bad example for the kids
yes , but the homeless shelter isn' t his place
he should' ve thought of that
wait .
let me tell you something
you know ... if you don' t have love it can be very hard
i' m sure it' s gonna work !
he' s a great guy
i' m sure he' s gonna phone him .
it' s gonna work

i' m going to tell you something very few people know
you want to hear ?
a long time ago ... 14 years ago , the age of my eldest son ...
i was very much in love with a man
i wanted to have a baby with him
it happened , and then he didn' t want it .
he left
i was very miserable
i got over it and discovered the joy of having a child
an immense joy ,
like nothing i' d ever known
i wanted to do it again , give him brothers and sisters
i wanted loads of them but never a man so i wouldn' t be let down
so i had more kids , but always with somebody passing through
they all have different fathers and none of the fathers know
there
you know ...
it' s funny , but ... when i saw you ...
i realized how very alone i am
it made me want to be with you
if i have one more , it' il be with you
you mean it ?
i wanted you to know
and i want you to know ... if you want to stay , it' s okay with me
okay ?
big smile ?
was it fine ?
you' re looking good this morning
are you angry ?
no , i' m not angry .
on the contrary
it' s good like this .
very good
otherwise i might have screwed up in terms of marinette ...
it' s much better this way
you like it ?
it' s great
how about mine ?
yours is nice
nathalie will like it , eh ?
thanks a lot
