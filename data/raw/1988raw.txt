your father won' t realize .
tell him it' s farmhouse pate .
don' t eat any yourself .
no need to buy bread every day .
warm it in the oven , and it' il be fine .
you can add a little chicory to his coffee .
dry the tea bags and you can use them again .
as for the eaujolais ... ... add a bit of this wine to the bottle each day .
for yourself , get what you like .
good evening .
bought more beaujolais ?
yes , on special .
i got this pate .
what do you think ?
not bad .
it' s a bit expensive , though .

stop , thief !
stop him !
are you hurt ?
you sweetheart !

when you grow up , come and see me sometime .
i' m 1 6 , you know .
i' ve already done it .

he' s got guts .
moron .
what are you doing ?
i' m cold .
close it !
the light ruins the bindings .
why are you showering all the time now ?
i' m cold .
at least your brother wasn' t like you .
why are you always thinking of him ?
got nothing to do ?
take a book .
he loved books .
you forgot to clean the shower yesterday .
think he' d have liked me ?
what a question .
why don' t you ever smile ?
i can' t afford to .
you think i' m rich ?
your till' s full of money .
that pays for the stock and the rent .
know how much i have left to live on ?
not a lot .
excuse me , mademoiselle .
when i say smiling' s for the rich ... ... i mean it' s for happy people .
you' re wrong .
smiling is what makes you happy .
like hell .
try it .
try it , you' il see .
just a second .
take this .
sauerkraut and meat , top quality .
thanks .
well ?
don' t look at me , look there .
it' s obvious .
i' m sorry , i don' t really understand .
all right .
i' il start again .
how about it ?
it' s thirty francs .
no problem .
you' re already a reporter ?
still a student .
reporter' s a good job .
you travel ... ... you learn things , you see people .
you see people too .
and what' s in them ?
can you do me up ?
you' re beautiful when you smile .
i am ?
a smile can work wonders .
sorry , i don' t have a present .
see , it works .
you can get all you want .
evening , dad .
it' s ready .
i got pate and beaujolais .
you' ve done something stupid .
look at me .
come here , let me see .
closer .
open wide .
you need braces .
your teeth are a mess .
forget something ?
it' s my fault .
if i was like paulie , dad would love me .
how do you know ?
paulie left .
maybe he hated your dad .
you think so ?
why else would he leave ?
i bet he knew how to smile .
mom never had time to teach me .
did you know paulie ?
i prefer you a hundred times .
i prefer you a hundred times .
help me .
it soothes the nerves .
he says i need braces , that i have crooked teeth .
let me see .
they' re not that bad .
look at mine .
smile less , that' il do .
can you imagine your mouth full of metal ?
the girls won' t believe you' re 1 6 .
you know about that ?
i don' t know anything .
i just know what' s in my koran .
it' s good to start off with professionals ... ... but afterwards , when you complicate things with feelings ... ... then you' il appreciate novices .
you go too .
at your age .
sorry .
heaven is for all of us , not just for minors .
how about a walk sunday afternoon ?
you like walking ?
you' re always on that stool .
well ?
a snapshot , gentlemen .
don' t move .
living in paris must be fun .
but you live in paris .
no , i live on blue road .
it' s too beautiful here for me .
you can find beauty wherever you look .
that' s what my koran says .
should i read your koran ?
if god wants to reveal life to you , he won' t need a book .
i thought muslims didn' t drink .
but i' m a sufi .
it' s not a disease , it' s a way of thinking .
although , some ways of thinking ... ... are diseases too .
mystical form of islam .
opposed to legalism , it stresses inner religion .
legalism : meticulous observance of the law .
opposed to legalism .
he' s against the law .
he isn' t always honest .
if respecting the law means being like him , that' s terrible .
i' d rather be against legalism .
inner religion ....
dictionaries always use words you don' t understand .
inner religion ....
i' ve been fired , moses .
i need to find a job ... ... somewhere else .
we have to tighten our belts .
how do you manage to be happy ?
i know what' s in my koran .
maybe i should pinch it one day .
although a jew shouldn' t .
what does being jewish mean to you ?
i don' t know .
for my dad , it means being depressed all day .
for me , it' s why i can' t be different .
your shoes are no good .
we' il buy you some tomorrow .
i don' t have any money .
it' il be my treat .
you only have one pair of feet .
look after them .
if your shoes hurt you , you change them .
you can' t change your feet .
son ... ... excuse me , i' ve left .
i' m not cut out to be a father .
perhaps we' il meet again one day ... ... when you' re a man ... ... when i' m less ashamed and you forgive me .
i' ve left my money on the table ... ... with a list of people to contact .
they' il take care of you .
goodbye .
you like it ?
you know it ?
look , it' s easy .
try it .
dad has indigestion .
what can i give him ?
fernet branca .
there .
i won' t buy any more pate .
what can i do for him tonight ?
ravioli ?
great idea , ravioli .
a koran ?
no .
why ?
not here .
why ?
my mom would murder me .
i' d murder her first .
silly .
when i bought these trousers , she called me a slut .
they look good on you .
you think so ?
not just the trousers .
even though i threw water at you , i still fancied you .
i know .
you knew ?
what do you want most of all ?
nothing ?
i' d like to meet my brother .
you have a brother ?
he lives with my mom .
i hate him .
why ?
if he was here , you' d be with him .
you wouldn' t look at me .
no .
yes .
it kills me , knowing you could be with another guy .
is that true ?
i think myriam' s in love with me .
i' m in love with her anyhow .
i' ve even gone off sylvie .
how' s your dad ?
i haven' t seen him lately .
he' s working a lot .
he leaves early for his new job .
isn' t he angry about the koran ?
i hide to read it .
i don' t understand much .
when you want to learn , you don' t pick up a book .
you talk to someone .
thank you , madame .
but you always say you know  what' s in my koran .
do you wash in the morning ?
of course i wash .
i even change my socks every day .
thirty francs .
next time , bring a note from your father .
she has a new boyfriend since yesterday .
maybe she even knew him before .
i knew it .
there' s always a paulie ... ... eating me up inside .
it doesn' t matter .
your love for her is yours .
it belongs to you .
she rejects it , but she can' t destroy it .
she' s just missing out on it .
what you give , momo , is yours for good .
what you keep is lost forever .
do you have a wife ?
yes .
how come we never see her ?
let' s cool off .
come on .
you didn' t answer me .
momo , no answer is an answer .
you' re circumcised too .
muslims are , like jews .
so you could be jewish .
this is my hand , this is my mouth .
i don' t understand .
you can' t understand everything with your mind .
where are you going ?
leave me alone .
where are you going ?
can' t you tell ?
it' s shabbat .
i saw you with richard .
i know .
so what ?
i don' t want to see you again .
why ?
why ?
you' re crazy !
stop it !
it' s over !
coming to see me ?
something wrong ?
come on , i' il make it better .
come on .
paulle
who is it ?
police .
we have some bad news , son .
your father' s been found dead under a train near marseilles .
it looks as if he took his own life .
now ... ... you' il need to identify the body .
i don' t want to see him .
who' s he ?
a friend of my father' s .
a friend ?
how good a friend ?
my wife looked after momo .
have you been here long ?
in france ?
very long .
momo grew up here .
you know his father ?
we ought to talk in private .
excuse me , momo .
is he sick ?
he' s burying my father .
i' m sorry .
suicide is worse than abandoning your kid .
excuse me , the door was open .
i' m looking for moses .
i' m his mother .
who are you ?
they call me momo .
short for mohammed .
you' re not moses ?
i' m mohammed .
there' s no moses here ?
moses has gone , ma' am .
he has ?
can i look round ?
he was sick of being here .
he had bad memories .
is this his room ?
i think so .
he likes music ?
is he coming back ?
i don' t know .
he went to find his brother .
his brother ?
paulie , i think .
yes , an older brother .
moses was my first child .
when will you adopt me ?
tomorrow , if you want .
honest ?
honest .
won' t your wife mind ?
my wife went back home a long time ago .
we' il go to see her if you want .
it' s a quarter to five .
we' re closed .
come back tomorrow at nine .
is lbrahim your first name or your surname ?
ibrahim demirdji .
spell the surname .
if you were french , it would be tough enough .
but in this case ... ... in your situation ... ... it would take more than a miracle .
come to office 206 at 9 on monday .
it' s an excellent vehicle .
four shock absorbers .
tax category seven .
you can get her up to 90 mph .
it was voted car of the year at the last motor show .
perhaps this one would be more suitable .
a v8 engine for flexibility .
don' t give me your spiel , i' m buying this one .
do you have a license ?
a license ?
of course .
here you are .
this is a driving license ?
of course .
can' t you tell ?
if i have to read arabic now .
follow me .
you can pay monthly installments over three years .
when i buy , i have the money .
here and now .
in that case , write a check for
no , i pay you now .
with cash .
here , real money .
you see ?
no one pays in cash .
that' s not possible .
why ?
this isn' t money ?
i accepted it , why won' t you ?
we' ve come to the wrong place .
all right .
that' s what we' il do .
we can deliver it in two weeks .
will that do ?
two weeks ?
i' il be dead in two weeks !
no , i want it tomorrow .
tomorrow , outside the store .
it' s beautiful .
i forget , momo .
what ?
you' ve driven before .
long ago , with my friend abdullah , but ....
but what ?
the cars weren' t like this .
they weren' t drawn by horses .
no , my boy , donkeys .
but your license ?
that was a letter from abdullah .
we' re in the shit , then .
gently !
both feet like this .
you ease one off and press the other down .
gently .
a car' s like a woman .
why didn' t you say so ?
she has ticklish feet .
okay , momo ?
let' s go .
gently .
there .
gently !
that' s a bend to the right .
you slow down .
this one ?
stop .
you slow down .
but i never go very fast .
obligatory stop .
you have to stop at 1 50 yards .
that' s a yellow line .
you have those on all the roads .
an unbroken line !
yes , unbroken .
country roads are beautiful .
hold on .
an unbroken line and ....
an unbroken line ....
there are dotted lines too .
no overtaking !
i' m learning , momo .
but it makes my brain shrink .
before parking , what do you do ?
before parking ?
you slow down .
the indicator !
you forget everything !
i can' t think of two things at once .
i know , you' il cough .
when you cough , i' il put the indicator on .
pull up there , behind the blue car .
stop the engine .
if there' d been a yellow line , what would you have done ?
an unbroken one ?
yes , unbroken .
but i used the indicator !
straight on .
straight on what ?
unbroken yellow , straight on .
no overtaking .
okay .
you get your license , but only just .
i wanted to say goodbye .
we' re going to turkey .
are you going away ?
goodbye .
rich people live here .
look at the rubbish bins .
what about them ?
to find out if a country ... ... is rich or poor , look at the bins .
if there are bins and no rubbish , it' s rich .
if there' s rubbish by the bins , it' s neither rich nor poor ... ... it' s touristy .
and if there' s rubbish but no bins , then it' s poor .
so this place is rich ?
you bet , this is switzerland !
is this place poor ?
yes , this is albania .
and here ?
smell that ?
the scent of happiness .
this is greece .
people don' t move .
they take the time to watch us pass .
i' ve worked hard all my life ... ... but i' ve always taken my time about it .
i' ve never tried for record sales ... ... or a crowd of customers .
slowness ... ... that' s the key to happiness .
what do you want to do later ?
i don' t know .
import export .
import export ?
that' s good .
import export .
meet my son momo ... ... who' il work one day in import export .
were you born by this sea ?
no .
what' s the matter ?
nothing .
why aren' t you speaking ?
listen .
smell .
i smell incense .
orthodox .
i smell candles .
catholic .
it stinks of feet !
and your feet don' t stink ?
you' re no better than others .
that odor reassures me .
i smell myself , i smell you .
where' s your sea ?
we' re getting there .
i' m happy , momo .
you' re here and i know what' s in my koran .
don' t be upset , but i keep thinking of blue road .
are you bored ?
no , no .
but i think about it .
it' s all i can think of .
i' il make you dance .
you ?
yes , you must .
absolutely .
a man' s heart is like a caged bird .
when you dance , your heart sings ... ... and then rises to heaven .
they spin around their hearts .
god is there , in their hearts .
it' s like a prayer .
they lose all their bearings , that burden we call balance .
they become like torches .
they burn in a blazing fire .
my head' s clear .
all my hatred ....
is that praying ?
let' s have some tea .
do you feel hatred too ?
good evening .
good evening .
it' s a hot one !
i' m french .
i don' t speak turkish .
do you think i' m good looking ?
you' re very good looking .
will i be good looking enough to attract girls without paying ?
in a few years , they' il pay for you .
it' s not great for now .
of course not .
see how you go about it ?
you stare as if to say , " see how good looking i am .
and so they just laugh .
i' ve never seen such beauty before .
for men like you and me ... ... not alain delon or marlon brando ... ... you' re beautiful through women .
man was mineral , then vegetable , then animal .
then he became man .
can you imagine the distance between dust and what we are now ?
later , you' il become an angel , after you finish with the earth .
when you dance , it' s like that .
wait here .
i won' t be long .
it' s over the mountain .
go on , get out .
get out .
why ?
i left so long ago , i don' t know what i' il find .
what' il i do here ?
speak with your smile .
i' il be back very soon .
see you , my son .
go back to your village .
i don' t know where i' m going .
what about lbrahim ?
where' s lbrahim ?
the journey ends here .
no .
yes .
i' ve arrived .
i didn' t know .
what about the sea ?
all rivers flow into the same sea .
no , momo .
i' m not pleased .
i' m scared .
i' m not scared .
i know ... ... what' s in my koran .
i' ve had a good life .
i' m old .
i' ve had a wife .
she died a long time ago ...
... but i still love her .
i' ve returned home .
the store was doing well .
the blue road is pretty ... ... even if it isn' t blue .
and then ... ... there' s you .
i don' t want this .
i' m not dying .
i' m going to join ... ... the immensity .
i' il read the will now .
this is my will and testament .
i , lbrahim demirdji , hereby leave all my goods to moses schmitt , my
mother , i' m in a meeting !
excuse me .
my son momo ... ... because he chose me as his father ... ... and because i' ve given him everything i' ve learned in
excuse me .
mother , listen to me , i' il call you later .
not now .
i , ibrahim demirdji , hereby leave all my goods ... ... to moses schmitt , my son momo ... ... because he chose me as his father ... ... and because i' ve given him everything i' ve learned in this life .
now you too will know what' s in my koran , momo .
it' s all there is to know .
now , i' m momo .
the whole street knows me .
i' m the corner arab , open from 8 a . m . to midnight ... ... even on sundays , in the grocery trade .
eight francs forty .
just a second .
you know , i' m not an arab , momo .
