what' s wrong with you , woman ?
who are you ?
your name roger merman ?
yes .
but ...
you doing three to six for embezzlement ?
uh , well , many accounting questions are not cut and dried .
do you live at 41 sage terrace ?
is it grandma ?
is my son all right ?
they' re fine .
do you have any houseguests ?
houseguests ?
thank you for your time .
god bless .
well , hey , who are you ?
houseguests ?
little trick i learned up at the north pole .
if you fry baloney , it tastes like a hot dog .
i thought you didn' t like sandwiches .
yeah , but this is not a sandwich .
a sandwich has two pieces of bread with a bunch of junk on it .
it' s like a tostada .
this isn' t a tostada .
there you go , granny .
little salsa here .
now it' s a tostada .
have you seen my advent calendar ?
what the fuck is it with the advent calendar ?
why are you so obsessed with that goddamn thing ?
the story sucks anyway .
i think i saw it in the hallway .
really ?
i think so .
looks like someone messed with my advent calendar .
what are you talking about ?
let me see .
nobody messed with it .
it looks fine .
there' s a candy corn in this one .
well , they can' t all be winners , can they ?
well , it' s fucked .
yeah ?
yeah .
fucked , frankly .
he' s ...
clean ...
oh .
as a fucking whistle .
nothing ?
no .
oh .
nothing .
i mean shit .
yeah .
he curses .
yeah ?
but never around children .
oh .
no criminal record .
yeah .
no parking tickets .
nothing .
no bad habits , even .
oh .
sex , yeah .
but man is a sexual being .
yeah .
fuckin ' darwinian .
oh .
you can' t do shit about that .
no .
hell , i wouldn' t want to .
no , of course not .
i' m not advocating celibacy .
hope not .
it' d be the end of the fucking human race .
yeah .
fucks large women .
what can i say ?
hey , look , it' s the retard again .
wedgie .
yeah .
yeah .
well , what the hell do you want ?
pokmon !
done .
you probably shouldn' t be digging in your ass .
santa ...
oh , jeez .
is that your underwear ?
part of it .
where the hell' s the rest of it ?
no , actually , don' t tell me .
what do you want ?
i was thinking i wanted a purple stuffed elephant , not pink .
but now i changed my mind .
yeah , what ?
now i don' t want an elephant .
i want a gorilla named davey for beating up the skateboard kids who pull on my underwear .
he could take his orders from the talking walnut , so it wouldn' t be my bad thing .
jesus , kid .
when i was your age , i didn' t need no gorilla , and i wasn' t as big as one of your legs .
four kids beat me up and i went crying to my daddy .
you know what he did ?
he made it all better ?
no , he kicked my ass .
you know why ?
' cause you went to the bathroom on mommy' s dishes ?
what the fuck ?
no .
he tried to teach you not to cry and be a man ?
no .
it' s because he was a mean , drunk son of a bitch .
when he wasn' t busting my ass , he was putting cigarettes out on my neck .
the world ain' t fair .
you gotta take what you need when you can get it .
learn to stand up for yourself .
quit being a pussy .
kick these kids in the balls or something .
or don' t .
shit , i don' t care .
just leave me out of it .
now , get on out of here .
okay .
thanks , santa .
go get the next lucky boy or girl , okay ?
all right , next .
open the ropes there , marcus .
i know you ?
not yet .
seven cities in seven years .

the store changes , your name changes .
but you always get away clean .
yeah .
pretty darn impressive .
well , let' s face the facts .
y' all are a couple of half bucket small timers .
you , because of your physical attributes , found a niche , and i respect that .
but you also been caught ... ... by me .

i don' t want to take over .
i don' t even want to change your scam .

i can always get another box jockey .
i can get another midget , too .
yeah , where ?
you see us hanging off of trees like fucking crab apples ?
even if we did , you' d never front your own racket .
you know why , willie ?
you got no discipline .
you got zero fuckin ' initiative .
you' d fall apart without me .
you' re too pathetic for words .
you' re a fucking loser , and you fucking know it .

i beat the shit out of some kids today .
but it was for a purpose .
it made me feel good about myself .
it was like i did something constructive with my life .
i don' t know .
like i accomplished something .
you need many years of therapy .
many , many , many fuckin ' years of therapy .
okay .
you don' t drink , which is smart on your part .
but being sober can put you at a disadvantage when it comes to violence .
i can' t box worth a shit , see .
but i' m good in a fight because i can' t feel anything .
you , you' re gonna feel everything .
okay .
now put your dukes up .
let me see what you got .

andy pitzorella ?
yeah .

andy pitzorella was andy blue balls .
since he got married , they call him andy pitzorella .
what' s your fucking point ? !
they say he can get into anything .
anything .
they say he' s been in margaret thatcher' s pussy .
and that' s a good thing ?
so what the fuck are you getting at ?
when i was in the joint with him , he told me that the kitnerboy redoubt can' t be cracked .
are you shittin ' me ?
are you telling me that after i propped you up , held you together , smiled for all those kids , danced for all those fucking housewives in a fucking lime green , fucking velvet elf costume , that you cannot get in this fucking safe ? !
is that what you' re telling me ? !
huh ? !
no , i' m just saying it' s gonna take a minute .

piece of cake .
i gotta get one more thing .
i' il be right back .
oh , shit .

i' il bet the store dick don' t want this .
store dick don' t want shit .
what do you mean ?
store dick' s dead .
store dick don' t want shit .
he' s dead , huh ?
i didn' t even know he was sick .
willie ... this has been a long time coming .
every year , you' re worse .
every year , less reliable .
more booze .
more bullshit .
more buttfucking .
sure , the three b' s .
you gotta be able to rely , willie .
you people are monsters .
there' s no joy in this for me .
i' m not talking about you taking me out .
that part , i get .
but look at all that shit .
do you really need all that shit ?
for christ sakes , it' s christmas .
it is christmas , willie .
but this is what we do .
we get the shit .
christmastime , we get the shit .
because we are men and lois .
it is christmas , willie .
and we are men and lois .
what you waiting for , honey ?
come on , plug him .
goodbye , willie .
drop the gun .
huh ? !
and you , santa , drop the elephant .
where did you come from ?
tipped off .
shit , that fucking kid .
all three of you are in so much shit , it' s almost unbelievable .
marcus , hop on !
fuck me .
hey , hey !
this is christmas , and the kid' s getting his fucking present .
halt , police !
put your hands up !
i said freeze !
freeze !
aaaah !
aaaah !
dear kid ...
i hope that you got my present and that there wasn' t too much blood on it , although there was blood on the present you gave me , which didn' t keep me from enjoying it .
so maybe the blood doesn' t matter so much , i guess .
anyway , just in case they took it as evidence ,
i' m also sending you a t shirt .
i hope it' s the right size .
i' m healing up good , and they tell me that i will soon be 100 % , even with 8 bullets dug out of me , because they didn' t hit any vital organs , just my liver , which is fucked anyway .
ha ha ha .
thank you for giving that letter to the cops .
i forgot i asked you to do it , but it' s a good thing you did or santa' s little helper would' ve plugged his ass .
now the cops know i wrote it , which is gonna keep my ass out of jail .
that , plus everyone agreeing that the phoenix police shooting an unarmed santa was even more fucked up than rodney king .
the cops are treating me like fucking royalty now , which is new in my experience .
they' re gonna make me a sensitivity counselor so that tragedies like this will never again embarrass the whole fucking department .
i told the cops you had no one to take the fuck care of you , so they set it up with mrs. santa' s sister watching you till your dad gets back in one year and three months .
they made her a guardian pro tem or some such shit .
anyway , she seems to like you and your house and jacuzzi .
i sent her some money , so if you play your cards right , you can probably get her to buy you something .
as for my little helper , i' m sorry to have to tell you that him and his prune faced , mail order wife are gonna be exploring mountains with your dad .
i hope your dad doesn' t go sucking shit from them
like i did .
they' re supposed to let me out of this hospital room soon , so get some sandwiches ready .
until then , don' t take no shit from nobody ,
least of all yourself .
ho ho ho .
your pal , santa .
hey , loser .
i hear your buddy' s not here to protect you anymore .
see you got me a new bike .
thanks a lot .
i' m talking to you , fat ass !
aaah !
