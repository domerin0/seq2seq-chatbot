ah hh .
shelly , they' re here .
relax , shorty .
hey .
nicky , you didn' t tell me you were coming .
i' m having a manicure here .
you think i don' t wash up after going to the john , huh ?
forget about it .
you look like a million bucks .
how are you ?
you should have called ahead .
i would have sent the car .
no , we figured we' d surprise you .
anytime , nicky , anytime .
i know that , partner .
shelly , let me introduce you to our brightest vp here .
this is larry sokolov .
his numbers guy , marty goldfarb .
how do you do , shelly ?
can i get you something to drink ?
i' d love a vodka tonic , thanks .
... comes out of the confessional and she says , " move over , i have to gargle .
so nicky , what brings you to town ?
shelly , i' ve got a smart kid here .
he' s got some good ideas about how to revitalize the shangri la .
revitalize ?
what are you talking about ?
we did $35 million last year .
why don' t you just hear the kid out , huh ?
shelly , i want you to know that i have nothing but the utmost respect for you .
you' ve done a tremendous job with the shangri la over the last 16 years .
i don' t think anybody can dispute that .
yeah , nobody doubts that , shell .
but the business has changed .
just take a look at the strip , you' il see what i' m talking about .
what ?
you mean that disneyland mookfest out there ?
huh ?
come on , you know what that is ?
huh ?
that' s a fucking violation is what that is .
it' s something that used to be beautiful .
it used to have class ,
iike a gorgeous high priced hooker with an exclusive clientele .
then along comes that steve wynn cocksucker and knocks her up and puts her in a fucking family way .
now , she' s nothing but a cheap fat whore hiding behind too much make up .
i look at her and see her stretch marks .
it makes me want to cry , because i remember the way she used to be .
am i right ?
there' s no arguing the bottom line .
those places are raking it in ... and the shangri la as she is now can' t compete with that .
you think i' m trying to compete with that ?
you think that' s what we' re about , trying to bring in the stroller crowd , fresh off some " e ticket " ride , trying to break the house on red and black ?
fremont has never been about that bullshit .
this is where old time and real money come to play .
the numbers don' t back you up on that , shelly .
don' t get me wrong .
nostalgia is great and we love nostalgia ... ... but nostalgia belongs in a museum .
i think it comes a time to decide whether you' re running a museum ... or you' re running a casino .
bernie .
mr. cool .
you got a minute ?
i was just heading over to 14 .
it can wait .
how' s the knee ?
i met this orthopedic surgeon at vegas memorial .
he tells me ... they can rebuild a man' s entire kneecap out of titanium .
oh , of course it costs a shitload of money , but seeing as this gentleman is into us for 500 large , i thought maybe
i told you , i' m not gonna be here after sunday .
where are you gonna go , bernie ?
where the fuck are you gonna go that' s better than here ?
i' ve got you covered in this town .
people know you work for me .
that' s currency in your pocket .
that' s fucking respect , when you walk the floor .
where are you gonna get that , anyplace else ?
seven days , shelly ...
i' m out from under .
excuse me , sweetheart .
what' s your name , darling ?
never mind .
this is who i am .
yeah , that' s right .
i like to know who' s shopping it around in my neighborhood , so what you do is be in my offiice first thing tomorrow morning , if you want to continue to work here at the shangri la and you and i will go over the rules together .
i also want you to bring me a clean bill of health .
all right , my dear ?
okay .
all right , thank you .
how' d you like to " birdie " that hole , huh ?
say the word and she' s yours anytime .
i' il keep a running tab for you .
nah .

what ?
she' s not your type ?
are you kidding me ?

i used to think your love ...   was something that i ...   could take ...   or leave alone   but now i couldn' t do without my supply ...
there he is .
hey .
shelly , i was a fucking embarrassment out there , do you understand that ?
you should never have talked me into going out there , shelly .
i should have never let you .
frank is rolling over in his grave .
i' ve got strep , man .
you understand that ?
i' ve got strep .
listen to me , pops , you were pure velvet out there .
it was just silk .
and also , looky looky what was hanging on the doorknob .

excuse me ?
they' re on sale in the lobby .
charlayne' s .
this is " victoria' s secret valentine collection .
what about that broad you got coming here later ?
how much did she set you back ?
nothing but the best for old buddy , right ?
are you fucking kidding me ?
gimme , you don' t deserve this .
you got all those ladies going home with a nice breeze between their legs ,
' cause you do it the way they like it and you' re saying i' m some buddy stafford ego pimp , huh ?

do you ever watch any of those nature shows ?
what ?
you know , those nature shows .
you watch them ?
yeah , i' ve seen a few nature shows .
yeah ?
well , this one i' ve seen about a dozen times .
it' s about ...
iions .
it' s about ... the cycle of life of the lions ... and the leader of the pack .
pride .
with lions it' s a pride .
yeah .
this old king lion , right ?
he' s getting on in years and then sooner or later some young male comes along .
he challenges him ... and he beats the fuck out of this old lion , right ?
he just kicks the shit out of him .
and then ... then they push him out of the pride ... and he has to go in the jungle and scavenge and he dies alone .
the nature' s got some sense of humor , huh ?
no shit .
see , but shelly , it' s tragic because ... he' s past it , this old fucked lion ... and he doesn' t know it and it would be so much easier for him , if he could just ... walk away .
and ... he could avoid all the pain and the humiliation .
hey ... that would be like accepting that you were dead already , right ?
i think i like it better nature' s way , don' t you ?
yeah , maybe you' re right .
yeah , that' s it .
buy you a drink ?
yeah .
shelly , you got a minute ?
shelly , this is johnny cappella .
how you doing , shelly ?
i know you from some place , right ?
johnny' s been opening for danny ganz at the mirage .
now sony is talking about signing him to a three album deal .
they' re going to position him as the new harry connick .
and i should be interested in this ... why ?
johnny' s looking to headline .
i thought we might be interested .
we ?
did i come at a bad time ?
even if i was interested ,
i got fresh ink with buddy for the next five years .
i just renegotiated his contract .
listen , you two need to be on the same page .
larry , listen , if i don' t hear from you by thursday ,

johnny cappella , gone .
we' il definitely be in touch , johnny .
assholes .
your progressed venus is in gemini ...
12 . 5 degrees ... and it' s in direct motion , which means ...
... you' re a slow starter when it comes to romance .
sorry .
you know what ?
this is real unprofessional of me .
i shouldn' t discuss your chart with you until i' m all done .
i can tell by the look on your face you think this is all a lot of b. s.
no , i just ...
i know what the outcome' s gonna be .
there' s not like one particular outcome .
a lot of things come into the picture , like ...
the planets , the moon phases  the outcome won' t change with me .
it' il be all bad .
oh , my god .
i have never met anyone who was so down on themselves .
do you know what i do at the shangri la ?
i asked around .
you' re a cooler .
you turn winners into losers .
do you know how i do that ?
listen , i know there' s a lot of stuff that happens in casinos all the time .
i do it by being myself .
people get next to me , their luck turns .
it' s always been that way .
well , that sounds like a self fulfilling prophecy to me .
there' s a whole chapter of that in my book ...
i only got six more days .
well ... really almost five .
i' m leaving town .
only five more days ?
then we shouldn' t waste any more time .
you want to go back to your place ?
if this is
i' m not sure ...
i' m not sure i can afford ...
i can' t afford to  christ .
oh , god .
i' m sorry .
wait , i didn' t mean it .
see , this is what i' m talking about .
i' ve gone and cooled the damn table .
shut up , bernie , shut up .
you haven' t gone and cooled anything .
not by a long shot .
oh , god .
you know ... once they' re dead , they don' t really grow back ... in case that' s what you were waiting for .
oh , my god , you got a cat ?
so ... you got any music ?
hey ... come here .

so ... want to go get some breakfast ?
they' ve got these rules about casinos hiring felons , so he got me a gig in telemarketing .
we were scamming pensioners out of their retirement money .
i lasted two weeks .
here you go .
by that time ...
i was really getting in deep .
i owed one of the casinos over a hundred grand .
i put shelly in a really awkward position .
i don' t blame him for what he did .
what ?
your leg ?
he did that to you ?
he shot you ?
no .
baseball bat .
i got off easy .
what do you mean you " got off easy " ?
i was out of control .
he maimed you , for fuck' s sake !
listen to me .
i' m grateful for what he did .
i am absolutely serious .
anytime i get an urge to play off the clock or so much as drop a quarter in a slot ,
i just reach down and feel what' s left of my cartilage .
it' s an excellent reminder .
jesus christ .
i thought shit like that only happened in the movies .
anyway , shelly and i worked out a repayment plan .
six years offi the books at the shangri la cooling tables
and in five days ...
three .
oh !
oh , shit .
oh , my god !

i' m going into labor .
yeah , i' m going into labor .

deep breaths , deep breaths .

hey , mikey .
how' s your mom doing ?
i' m gonna pretend like you give a shit and tell you she' s getting by as long as she' s high .
her name is charlene , in case you were wondering .
hey , when' s the last time you saw a doctor ?
about six months ago , back in jersey .
i wasn' t about to go back there after they treated me like cattle .
just ' cause i had no insurance , you know ?
all those places are crawling with tb from them spics .
listen , mikey , if you want to ... why don' t you drop by the bettor life motel , give us a chance to ... to catch up ?
yeah , yeah , yeah , maybe we' il do that .
play catch up , for the kid' s sake .
thanks .
don' t mention it .
dealer : $100 minimum table , sir .
no offense , pal , but there' s 20 other tables here .
what do you want to come sit on my head for ?
i' m just gonna play one hand .
i' m feeling lucky tonight .
i' ve got this voice in my head that says , " this is the table .
lnsurance ?
no .
oh , yes !
yes , yes !
busto !
mel , what' s happening to you ?
oh , yeah , welcome to mel' s house .
hey , where are you going ?

hey !
what was that ?
i mean , what the fuck gives ?
is it mcgann ?
the guy' s been with me 1 2 years .
he' s as stand up as my fucking dick .
maybe he' s having money problems .
i' m gonna pull him .
no , no , no .
was he counting them ?
the mook with the streak ?
is there a problem ?
no , there' s no problem .
fella' s on a streak , is all .
let me guess , this is one of your " coolers " ?
why don' t you announce it to the whole fucking joint while you' re at it ?
they told me that you were a sticker for the old ways , but coolers ?
what is this guy , really ?
a car mechanic ?
some kind of shill ?
' cause he doesn' t look too effective to me .
he' s the best .
take it from me .
all right .
sure .
whatever .
there are ways subtle ways that we can keep the odds in our favor .
i' m talking about more forward thinking methods .
i' m sure you' ve got a whole prospectus on the subject , right ?
well , as a matter of fact , yeah , i do .
for instance , i can tell you right off the bat the wallpaper' s not gonna cut it .
it' s too uplifting .
i would suggest going with some more muted tones .
wallpaper ?
yeah .
and personally ,
i think the cocktail waitresses could pop another button or two .
myself , i wouldn' t hire anything less than a " c " cup .
you know what that is ?
no .
it' s music to be sure .
it' s pleasant , not intrusive , but recorded at a subsonic level is a mantra .
lose ...
iose ...
iose .
we' re just skimming the surface , shelly .
we really need to talk .
shelly ?
you better come quick .
contact his daughter and assist with the arrangements .
the shangri la will cover all expenses .
what about the paradise ?
she' s going dark tonight .

no , no , no .
thank you .
thanks .
what ?
nothing .
what ?
you' re an easy mark , is all .
i' m an easy mark ?
you know where that comes from ?
no .
years ago , shelly and me were working coney lsland for the summer and when i' d see a guy who had a full wallet and was willing to open it up ,
i' d mark him with chalk .
i' d put it on my hand and go something like ,
hey , man , good work .
hey , buddy , how you doing ?
what the guy didn' t realize was that when he walked down the way ...
shelly could spot him a mile off .
an easy mark .
thanks a lot , bernie .
i' ve got to sit .
hi .
you okay ?
yeah .
did you notice , last night , that tattoo on my butt ?
little joe ?
yeah .
yeah , two 2' s .
little joe .
i had a son .
his name was joe .
i was his mother for one year .
you don' t have to tell me this .
no , i want to , bernie .
i gave my son up for adoption .
i just wanted my life back .
i was 17 going on 18 and i was so fucking selfish .
my family didn' t want nothing to do with me after that , so i hitched a ride out here and thought i' d make it as a showgirl .
10 years later ...
i' d like to think that if it happened when i was older , with a guy that i cared about , that it would have been different , you know ?
i think about my little joe sometimes and i do know i did the right thing .
i' m convinced of that .
natalie ...
i think ...
i think i could kick your ass at the dime toss .
you may not be an angel   ' cause angels are so few
but until the day that one comes along ...
would you do something for me ?  i' il string along with you ...
yeah !
yeah !
yeah !
bernie !
yes !
oh , yeah .
ow !
ow !
jesus , ow .
oh , yeah !
bernie , let' s do it up the ass .
okay .
please , please ?
okay , okay .
no , my ass !
oh !  and until the day that one comes along ...
yes !
shut the fuck up in there !
did we wake you ?  for every little fault that you have
see , i' ve got three or four
the human little faults you do have
just make me love you more ...
i have to pee .
i' m always peeing .
hey .
how did you get in here ?
i told the desk clerk bernie was my old man .
he let us wait inside .
is that cool with you ?
bernie is out looking for a parking space .
i must have taken the last one .
i didn' t get your name .
natalie , mikey .
tell me something , natalie , is he paying you ?
excuse me ?
my old man , is he renting your ass ?
because , otherwise , i just don' t get it .
i mean , a loser like my pops in the company of some primo tits and ass ?
it don' t compute .
is this enough to get me a little taste ?
family discount ?
are you kidding me ?
no , baby .
mikey !
hey , bernie .
i told you we was gonna stop by .
i thought you' d call ahead first .
we were at breakfast .
hey .
hey .
you missed some .
hey , that' s nice .
hi .
hi .
you see , bernie , the thing is ... we' re kind of strapped .
i mean , charly here is expecting like yesterday .
and we don' t have the dough to make with the right nutrition for her and all .
so i was wondering if you would like to invest a little ... maybe in your grandchild' s future , his well being .
it' s almost three grand .
that' s all i got .
that' s that' s very generous .
bless you , bernie .
you want to feel it ?
you know , i really i don' t think ...
oh i just felt a kick .
come on , bernie , give me your hand .
you feel that ?
i don' t know .
i think so .
hey , we' il catch you later , bernie .
okay .
thanks .
take care , dad .
new shangri la hotel and casino .
we break ground on her in six months .
she' s perfect .
three floors of gaming ,
imax theater , entertainment center , boutiques , restaurants , roller coaster .
you name it , we' ve got it .
she pays for herself in three years .
after that , it' s easy money .
isn' t she great , shell ?
in " lost horizon , " these people , their plane crashes in the himalayas and they get rescued ,
taken to this utopia in the mountains , shangri la .
it' s beautiful .
totally isolated , untouched by the outside world .
no war , no greed , no bullshit .
time has slowed down .
you never age .
it' s paradise .
you see , that' s what shangri la is .
it' s paradise .
yeah , we' ve seen the movie , shelly .
what' s your point ?
my point is , you don' t fuck with paradise .
come on .
jesus , shelly .
hey , we' re not trying to fuck with it .
we' re trying to make it better .
how ?
how you gonna make it better ?
it' s perfect just the way it is .
it' s the last of its kind .
it' s pure .
this this is a fucking mockery .
how is it a mockery , shelly ?
it' s right out of the movie .
who' s talking about a movie ?
this is not a movie .
this is my fucking life .
let me ask you one question , where are you gonna be when they decide to change it back ?
when people want the real vegas again , before all this " epcot center " bullshit ?
who' s gonna give it to them ?
you ?
i don' t think so .
you know who ?
the same fucks who started this in the first place .
you know what' s gonna happen ?
it' s gonna come around full circle and bite you on the fucking ass , take my words for it .
shelly , you make some good points , huh ?
maybe we' il swing back the other way someday .
who the hell knows ?
but for now , this moment , i suggest we shoot the dice .
my friend , i think you should take some time just to think things through .
i know this is a lot to digest , i know that .
wait up a second .
what do you say ?
i thought we were gonna go eat .
why don' t you try this table over here ?
it' s a little less crowded .
no , let' s play here .
it' s my lucky table .
i always play here .
come on , it' s more private over here .
shelly , i' m a big guy .
i know how to take care of myself .

i know how to find you .
go ahead .
go eat .
here we go .

but no , you have to go and get all profound on the poor schmuck .
i love you , bernie .
what the hell were you thinking ?
those four words of endearment have cost this casino one million and counting today .
i don' t understand what that means .
lady luck .
you' ve heard of " lady luck , " haven' t you ?
yeah .
that' s what' s going on out there .
lootz is kryptonite on a stick .
he should have them throwing ice cubes right now , but instead i' ve got a meltdown on my hands .
so here' s the situation : you are out of his life , before he even gets home .
don' t even tell him to his face .
leave him a note .
i' m gonna make some calls and you' re gonna be situated at another joint .
i don' t think i can do that , shell .
excuse me ?
i said ...
i don' t think i can do that , shell .
it wasn' t an act .
i meant it .
you love him ?
yeah .
i love the schmuck .
what the fuck is there to love ?
he' s a loser .
always has been , always will be .
i thought you were a smart cookie when i picked you out .
you do not want to fuck with me .
because if you do , your next john is going to be a fucking rattlesnake in the fucking desert .
do you understand me ?
yeah .
get out of here .
hey , natalie .
it doesn' t matter .

i want you to tell me the truth , shelly .
did you say something to natalie ?
did you muscle her ?
jesus , bernie .
is that what you think ?
that i would fuck with your happiness ?
that hurts me .
i don' t know .
this guy is all flash .

buddy was tired .
i gave him the easy way out .
things could have been so much worse .
gave him the easy way out " ?
what are you talking about ?
he
buddy never would have taken the buyout .
he would have stuck to his guns right to the end .
they would have ended up hurting him .
i could not allow that to happen .
jesus .
you you sit here and you justify it like you' re dr. kevorkian or something ?
hey , listen to me .
i loved that son of a bitch , but his time was up .
what was i supposed to do , leave him to those corporate fucking scumbags ?
what i did was a humanitarian thing , that i have no doubt about .
and afterwards i held him in my arms and i cried like a fucking baby .
what ?
what is this fucking look you' re giving me now ?
what is that , huh ?
there are the sins of the flesh .
there are the sins of the gambling halls ...
be it dice or in some cases ,
the devil' s thumbpapers .
let' s take off tonight .
i can' t do that .
i have an obligation to shelly .
he

he doesn' t give a shit about you , bernie .
let' s just climb in your car and drive the hell out of here tonight .

you heartless fuck .
i thought

i thought he was your friend .
who do you think you are ?
who the fuck do you think you are ?
you' re nobody !
i could make you disappear like that and not one fucking person would miss you .
not one fucking person !
bernie would !
he loves me .
he loves me ... and that kills you , doesn' t it , shell ?
that kills you !
that kills you , doesn' t it ?
he was your only friend and you crippled him .
you crippled him and he still stood by you , but no more , shell .
the only friends you' ve got now are the fucking guys on your payroll .
you don' t own me anymore , shelly , and you don' t own bernie .
we' re leaving here tonight .
i am taking him and there is not a fucking thing that you can do about it !
and you will be all alone !

we' ve got to call the police .
i thought , " easy money .
what are you talking about ?
shelly .
he paid me to get close to you , to keep you around .
shelly ... ?
yeah .
shelly .
you were right that first night .
i was for sale .
bought and paid for .
you were the " easy mark , " bernie .
at first i thought that you were just another way to make a quick buck , you know ?
and then i started to take a closer look .
andforthefirsttime , you were somebody who wasn' t trying to hustle me , somebody who wasn' t trying to pretend he was someone he wasn' t .
just a decent guy , trying to get back on track .
and it didn' t hurt any that you put me up on a pedestal .
it sure puts the gutter in perspective .
shelly paid you ?
shelly wants me gone .
he says i bring you luck .
lady luck .
i stayed to tell you to your face ... and i knew you wouldn' t want me no more and i could just go .
we' ve got to get you to the hospital .
we' il talk about this later .
tell me again , bernie .
tell me everything' s gonna be okay .
everything' s gonna be fine .
this is our time .
this is you and me and we' re going for it .
oh , my god .
hey .
you look in the mirror , you don' t like what you see , don' t believe it .
look in my eyes .
i am the only mirror you' re ever gonna need .
you look into my eyes , natalie .
bernie , bernie , wait , wait .
your chart that first night
i wasn' t being straight with you .
it is the worst chart i' ve ever seen .
there' s nothing in the cards for you , i' m telling you .
no , don' t you see ?
that was before .
that was before you opened up your heart to me .
everything' s different now .
i got lady luck on my side .
nothing' s gonna happen to me .
wait .
here .
look , i got $3, 000 he paid me .
maybe shelly will take it as a down payment , and we can pay in installments , when we get settled , okay ?
i don' t think $3, 000  come on , take it , bernie !
... street vendors in your face .
i walk up there , i' d want to shoot myself .
i suppose you' d like that freak show , huh , harvard ?
yeah , i do .
it brings people downtown into the casino .
that is good for business .
oof !
hey !
you lay another finger on her , i swear to god , i' il kill you .
are you listening to me ?
i will fucking kill you .
why , shelly ?
how could you do that to her ?
because i never let go of a good thing , bernie , and you are a very , very good thing .
the best cooler there ever was and i need him back .
he ain' t never coming back .
that is a dead man talking .
shelly ...
i' m done with this joint , natalie and me .
we are out of here .
i' il get a job out in the world .
i' il send you half my paycheck every month .
i' il make good on my commitment .
bernie , if you bail on me , they' re gonna throw your fucking ass off the roof of this building snatch the broad , and throw her right the fuck on top of you .
i don' t think so , ' cause if you whack me , then bernie lootz ain' t the biggest loser in the world no more .
that honor is gonna rest upon you , shelly .
and maybe you had it all along .
i' m the loser ?
what do you got , other than this joint ?
what more do i need ?
you got nothing .
this place your legacy , it' s a mirage .
you turn your back , it don' t even exist .
there' s no night , there' s no day , it' s just one big fucking blur and it don' t count for nothing .
you believe this fucking guy ?
i feel sorry for you , shelly .
you' re the worst kind of gambler there is , too scared to throw his chips on the table .
too scared to extend any real kind of friendship .
always scared he' s gonna end up out in the desert .
well , sweet fucking dreams , pal .
i' m out .
if that' s where it ends , that' s where it ends .
jesus christ , that' s such a fucking touching speech , bernie .
all that jimmy stewart bullshit ,
i got such a lump in my throat , i can' t tell you .
but it doesn' t change a thing .
if you don' t make good on my 150 g' s , i' m gonna close the books on you .
