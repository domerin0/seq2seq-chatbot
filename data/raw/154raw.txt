miami , my friend , is not cuba .
i see not catching aidid is becoming a routine .
we weren' t trying to catch aidid .
we were trying to catch you .
me ?
but am i that important ?
i hardly think so .
you' re just a businessman .
trying to make a living .
yeah .
selling guns to aidid' s militia .
you' ve been here , what ?
six weeks ?
six weeks you are trying to catch the general .
you put up reward posters . $25, 000 .
what is this ?
gunfight at the k. o. corral ?
it' s the o. k. corral .
do you think bringing me in will make him suddenly come to you ?
make him more agreeable ?
you know where he sleeps .
you pay for his beds , much less his militia .
we' re not leaving somalia till we find him .
and we will find him .
don' t think because i grew up without running water ... ... l am simple , general .
i do know something about history .
see all this ?
it' s simply shaping tomorrow .
a tomorrow without a lot of arkansas white boys ' ideas in it .
well , i wouldn' t know about that .
i' m from texas .
mr. garrison , i think you shouldn' t have come here .
this is civil war .
this is our war .
not yours .
300, 000 dead and counting .
that' s not a war , mr. atto .
that' s genocide .
now , you enjoy that tea , you hear ?
how' d he strike you ?
urbane , sophisticated , cruel .
yeah , he' s a good catch .
it' il take time , but aidid will feel the loss .
i' m not sure time is something we got in great supply .
this isn' t lraq , you know .
much more complicated than that .
boss , most of washington might disagree .
they' ve been calling for situation reports every morning this week .
well , tell them the situation is fragile .

common usage .
lf it' s not in the dictionary it doesn' t count !
it doesn' t have to be in the dictionary !
it does have to be in the dictionary !

yeah , i know .
sergeant .
sergeant .
what' s going on here ?
some aerial target practice , sir .
didn' t want to leave it behind .
i' m talking about your weapon .
delta or no delta , that' s a hot weapon .
you know better than that .
safety should be on at all times on base .
well , this is my safety , sir .
let it go , sir .
the guy hasn' t eaten in a couple of days .
you delta boys are a bunch of undisciplined cowboys .
let me tell you something , sarg' nt .
when we get on a five yard line , you' re going to need my rangers .
y' all better learn to be team players .
we' re done here .
speak up .
you say this is your safety ?
well , this is my boot , son .
and it will fit up your ass with the proper amount of force .
ls that a jersey accent ?
i' m trying to do this , give me a break .
take those sunglasses off .
delta wants to wear oakleys , that' s their business .
i don' t want to see them on you again .
is that a hot weapon ?
ls that your move ?
ls my hand on the piece ?
i can mate you in three whatever you do .
i' d keep my eye on that queen before counselling others .
well , she' s just lying in wait .
yikes .
it' s good .
you' re really improving .
lf i may make a suggestion observation .
go ahead .
it' s a children' s book , right ?
right .
they are not supposed to scare the living shit out of the children .
this is the part of the story where our knight is slaying the dragon .
that' s scary .
besides , my daughter loves this stuff .
thought you finished that last week .
you done ?
hey , we are at the 10 yard line here , men .
you understand ?
can you count ?
one , two , ten .
okay ?
where are my running backs ?
where are my running backs ?
hey , i didn' t see you at church on sunday .
you had something more important to do ?
not on sunday , you don' t .
not anymore .
i will make you believe , you understand ?
pretty funny , hoo ah ?
it was a good impression .
i recognize myself .
all right , carry on .
i' d like a word , specialist .
sir .
you understand why we have a chain of command , don' t you ?
roger that , sir .
lf you ever undermine me again , you' il clean latrines with your tongue ... ... till you taste no difference between shit and french fries .
are we clear ?
hoo ah , sir .
all right .
lf one skinny kills another his clan owes the dead guy' s clan a hundred camels .
a hundred camels .
camels .
i wouldn' t pay one camel .
must be a lot of fucking camel debt .
ls that really true , lieutenant ?
ask sgt. eversmann .
he likes skinnies .
sgt. eversmann , you really like the skinnies ?
it' s not that i like them or i don' t like them .
i respect them .
see , what you guys fail to realize is the sergeant is a bit of an idealist .
he believes in this mission down to his bones .
don' t you , sergeant ?
look , these people , they have no jobs ... ... no food , no education , no future .
i just figure that , i mean , we have two things that we can do .
we can help ... ... or we can sit back and watch the country destroy itself on cnn .
right ?
i don' t know about you guys , but i was trained to fight .
are you trained to fight , sergeant ?
well , i think i was trained to make a difference , kurth .
like the man said , he' s an idealist .
oh , wait .
this is my favourite part .
stay away from the cans !
die , gas pumper !
stay away from those cans !
no , no , stay back .
he' s having a seizure .
put something in his mouth .
john , it' s okay .
john , it' s okay .
it' s okay .
well , he' il be fine .
but not in this army .
he' s out of the game .
he' s epileptic , going home .
i' m putting you in charge of his chalk .
you got a problem with that ?
no , sir .
it' s a big responsibility .
your men will look to you to make the right decisions .
they' re lives depend on it .
all right .
rangers lead the way , sir .
all the way .
good luck .
a meeting ofaidid' s senior cabinet may take place today at 1500 hours .
i say " may " because we all know by now ... ... with the intel we get on the street , nothing is certain .
this is actual intel confirmed by three sources .
omar salad , aidid' s top political advisor ... ... and abdi hassan awale , interior minister .
these are the guys we' re after .
today we go .
same mission template as before .
1545 , assault force delta will infiltrate the target building ... ... and seize all suspects within .
4 ranger chalks , under command of capt. steele ... ... will rope in at 1546 ... ... and hold a four corner perimeter around the target building .
no one gets in or out .
lt. colonel mcknight' s humvee column will drive in at 1547 ... ... on hawlwadig road and hold just short of the olympic hotel .
wait for the green light .
now once delta gives the word ... ... mcknight' s column will go to the target and load the prisoners onto trucks .
lmmediately after the prisoners are loaded ... ... the four ranger chalks will collapse back to the target building ... ... load up on humvees ... ... and the entire ground force will exfil the 3 miles back to base .
mission time , no longer than 30 minutes .
now , i had requested light armour and ac 130 spectre gunships ... ... but washington , in all its wisdom , decided against this .
too high profile .
so black hawks and little birds will provide the air cover ... ... with miniguns and 2 . 75 rockets .
colonel harrell .
ln the c 2 bird , colonel matthews will coordinate the air mission ... ... and i will coordinate ground forces .
colonel matthews .
mission launch code word is lrene .
questions ?
which building is it , sir ?
we' re confirming that now .
somewhere near the bakara market .
i don' t choose the time or place of their meetings .
i didn' t say a word , sir .
make no mistake , once you' re in the bakara market ... ... you' re in an entirely hostile district .
don' t underestimate their capabilities .
no one fires unless fired upon .
now , let' s go get this thing done .
good luck , gentlemen .
what' s the matter , danny ?
something you don' t like ?
no spectre gunships , daylight instead of night ... ... afternoon when they' re all fucked up on khat ... ... only part of the city aidid can mount a counter attack on short notice ....
what' s not to like ?
life' s imperfect .
for you two , circling above it at 500 feet , it' s imperfect .
down in the street , it' s unforgiving .
what the fuck , smith ?
well ?
well , what ?
we going ?
why should i tell you that ?
because i' m me .
yeah .
3 : 00 .
downtown .
bakara market .
all right .
listen , smith , i need you to back me up out there today , all right ?
keep sharp .
yes , sir , sergeant eversmann .
ev , it' s going to be nothing , man .

it' s all in the grind , sizemore .
can' t be too fine , can' t be too coarse .

sergeant eversmann said to get your stuff and get ready .
it' s what you wanted , isn' t it ?
oh , yeah .
hell , yeah .
grimesy , stick with waddell and give him ammo when he needs it .
hoo ah ?

might even be fun .

all we got to do is cover them .
choppers going to cover us , and we' il be all right .

they' re banged up pretty bad .
he set up a casualty collection point , i don' t think they' il be able to move .

a crowd is advancing six , seven blocks from the crash .
shughart and gordon again requestpermission ... ... to secure until convoy arrives .

they know what they' re asking .

lf colonel mcknight went back to base , then he had a good reason .
it changes nothing .

i understand , but it is my duty to remind him ... ... that my men are surrounded by thousands of armed somali militia .
it' s imperative that we move them out of the hostile area and into the safe zone .
i need his help now .

you are the ranger who kills my people ?

my government will never negotiate for me .
then perhaps you and i can negotiate , huh ?
soldier to soldier .
i' m not in charge .

you have the power to kill , but not negotiate .
ln somalia , killing is negotiation .
do you really think if you get general aidid ... ... we will simply put down our weapons ... ... and adopt american democracy ?
that the killing will stop ?
without victory , there can be no peace .
there will always be killing , you see ?
this is how things are in our world .

you some kind of war junkie ?
i won' t say a goddamn word .

they won' t understand .
they won' t understand why we do it .
they won' t understand it' s about the men next to you .
and that' s it .
that' s all it is .
don' t even think about it , all right ?
i' m better on my own .
we started a whole new week .
it' s monday .
i was talking to blackburn the other day ... ... and he asked me , " what changed ?
why are we going home ?
and i said , " nothing .
but that' s not true , you know .
i think everything' s changed .
i know i' ve changed .
a friend of mine asked me before i got here ....
it was when we were all shipping out .
why are you going to fight somebody else' s war ?
what , do y' all think you' re heroes ?
i didn' t know what to say at the time ... ... but if he asked me again , i' d say no .
i' d say there' s no way in hell .
nobody asks to be a hero .
it just sometimes turns out that way .
i' il talk to your ma and pa when i get home , okay ?
my love , you are strong and you will do well in life .
i love you and my children deeply .
today and tomorrow , let each day grow and grow .
keep smiling and never give up , even when things getyou down .
so , in closing , my love ... ... tonight , tuck my children in bed warmly .
tell them i love them .
then hug them for me ... ... and give them both a kiss good night for daddy .
