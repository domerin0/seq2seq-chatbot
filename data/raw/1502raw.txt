honey ?
frank ?
what' s the matter ? ls he kicking again ?
no , it' s time .
you always make me feel so ....
you' re awful .
let' s get ready , okay ?
okay .
honey , you' d better go wake up chris .
come on , i got your number .
come on .
attaboy .
dad , what time is it ?
you know what time .
it' s time to get up .
i have to drop you off at charley' s house .
you' il have to go to school from there .
why ?
i wonder why .
i don' t know .
ls mom having the baby ?
yes , that' s a trick she does rather well every 1 1 years .
i guess so .
why don' t you get dressed ?
don' t forget your books .
okay .
dad , can anything happen to her ?
i saw on tv in a movie once where the mother died .
you know something ?
things like that happened a long time ago .
they just don' t happen that way anymore .
she had you , didn' t she ?
yeah .
look at the size of you , you big ox .
okay , now .
let' s get ready .
attaboy .
why can' t i go with you and dad to the hospital ?
we' d love to have you there ... but the doctors simply don' t allow little boys in hospitals .
i could have my tonsils out again .
you' d be there for a week , and we' d be home in three days .
you young whippersnappers , you' re not like the old team ... out with old mr. dunston in the plains and prairie , driving those cattle ... getting their tonsils out in the middle of the night with no doctors .
you' re not a chip off the old block .
they' re scouts .
maybe charley won' t like having me around .
charley won' t like having you around ?
charley only sees his own boys two sundays a month , and he loves kids .
you young whippersnapper , kiss your mother goodbye .
listen , we' il both give you a call ... as soon as we find out whether you' ve got a baby sister or a baby brother .
i don' t care what it is as long as you' re okay .
and you give me one of the puppies .
honey , your books .
bye , charley .
okay , lenore .
good luck to you .
call me , frank .
let' s go and whip up some french toast .
i' m having my baby .
nurse , know what they call them ?
ln lreland , my mother used to call them ... the wee cuddies and the wee cubs .
i mean , where can you get that ?
boy , i hope i have one like that .
sir , would you please come to the labor room now ?
it' s time to go back to the labor room .
the labor room ?
yes , this way .
how did you know about the wee cuddies and the wee cubs ?
i learned about them a long time ago .
do you speak gaelic ?
are you lrish ?
no , scottish .
but i do speak gaelic .
you do speak gaelic ?
this way , please .
an lrish and a gaelic .
an lrish and scottish lass .
hang on to my hand , honey .
i' m not very brave .
this little guy' s going to kill me .
maybe i' il get a doctor .
no .
he' s just different than chris , that' s all .
i tried to talk to the doctor .
i just couldn' t make him understand .
it seems like it' s different .
i think you' d better get the nurse .
nurse , hurry up , please .
you' d better go to the waiting room .
just a minute , please .
i love you .
i' m glad we decided to have the baby .
aren' t you , sweetheart ?
we both want it .
don' t worry about a thing .
it' s not going to tie you down , is it , sweetheart ?
you going to feel trapped like you did last time ?
calm down .
take a deep breath .
i am !
try to relax .
take a deep breath .
you got something to stir the coffee with ?
use that .
i' ve been using it for the past three hours .
after a while , you get used to the taste of lead in your coffee .
there' s an overabundance of lead in all the things we eat nowadays .
we' re slowly but surely poisoning ourselves , you know that ?
fine world to bring a kid into , fellows .
i can cite examples
you don' t have to lecture us .
just look at that smog out the window .
what' s the difference if we breathe it or eat it ?
maybe we' il learn to adapt to it .
i' m an exterminator .
we service the beverly hills westwood area .
here' s my card .
i' m not trying to drum up business or anything .
the point is that years back we developed this spray ... to kill roaches and other household pests .
all we ended up doing is creating a new breed of roaches .
ls that right ?
bigger , stronger , and harder to kill .
listen , you want to play poker ?
five card draw ?
might as well .
let' s clear some of this stuff away and get going .
i just hope my wife isn' t going to have any trouble .
she did the last baby in 45 minutes .
no kidding .
that' s a fact .
i thought they said the second one came faster .
you got nothing to complain about .
my wife' s been in labor for six hours .
son of a bitch of a thing stole my 50 cents .
here' s your 50 cents .
come on , sit down .
read a magazine or something .
you know what' s the biggest problem in beverly hills ?
snails .
snails and slugs .
they can wipe out a lawn in just a few weeks .
folks feel sorry for them .
they' re not like your usual pest .
folks hate to see all them snails laying on their lawns , dead .
snails and slugs and bugs .
any of you guys in a happier profession ?
i think we' ve got a really effective anesthetic .
we' il check you before we really do anything .
i heard  you' re doing just great .
just relax .
it' s really been different than chris .
you' ve done your share .
we' il do ours now .
she' s fully dilated .
the head' s on the perineum .
something' s wrong .
i know something' s wrong .
it' s nothing really wrong , honey .
it' s just a very big baby .
it' s going to be fine , but i need your help .
i know something' s wrong .
how big was your last baby ?
7 pounds , 4 ounces .
i told you that this baby was different than chris .
this baby is just gigantic .
it' s probably 10 pounds , 10 . 5 pounds , maybe even 1 1 pounds .
it' s got a gigantic head .
but she' s got a big pelvis and plenty of relaxation .
i' m trying to cooperate !
all right , relax .
this is just immense .
we' re just putting forceps on the baby' s head .
just breathe deep .
don' t push .
just pant .
we' re just easing the baby out .
i know , but it' s ....
all right .
now we just cut you .
you didn' t feel that , did you ?
no .
okay , fine .
the baby will be out in just about 30 seconds .
davis , wait !
what does my baby look like ?
what' s wrong with my baby ?
doctor !
mr. davis , out of here !
how' s my baby ?
the umbilical cord' s been severed , but not surgically .
it looks like it' s been chewed off .
where' s the baby ?
get off of me !
get your hands off !
orderly !
lenore !
come on , let' s go !
let me go !
everything' s going to be all right .
my wife isn' t !
tell me my baby' s not dead .
don' t touch me .
don' t you touch me .
they' ve stolen my baby .
i don' t want my baby to be dead .
tell me my baby isn' t dead .
please .
i assure you , mrs. davis , your baby is very much alive .
thank you .
we located a broken skylight on the third floor .
blood and excess tissue on the roof .
lieutenant , what' s it look like to you ?
something small .
doctor .
she' s coming out of sedation now .
lenore , can you hear me , darling ?
somebody might have abducted our baby , and i' m holding this hospital responsible .
that hole in the skylight isn' t large enough for a full sized human being .
there' s no other way out of that delivery room .
the doctor' s correct .
let' s not discuss it , lieutenant .
i' ve asked your husband to submit to some tests .
and i' ve refused .
you' ve never been exposed to radioactivity and radioactive material ...
or undergone extensive x rays ?
no , doctor .
i told you .
we can' t rule out genetic damage .
i noticed that you did inquire about abortion eight months ago .
doesn' t everybody inquire about it nowadays ?
it' s just a question of convenience , and we decided to have the baby .
we all make mistakes .
i apologize for that crack .
let me talk to you outside .
come on .
you' re not afraid of me , are you ?
i' ve always been afraid of you , especially those eyes .
i wanted a boy so badly .
i think he was probably very frightened .
you know , he' s different .
i think he was probably afraid they were going to hurt him .
sweetheart .
he' s not ugly .
you' re so exhausted , sweetheart .
you don' t know what you' re saying .
i' m going to check up on those two .
i don' t trust them .
can you imagine ?
can you imagine those guys , trying to blame us ?
we are the parents , sweetheart .
i' il be right back .
okay .
dr. norton has decided your wife can go home .
first thing in the morning .
of course , you realize ... it' s in everyone' s interest to keep this quiet for the time being .
at least , until we can find out what' s become of the infant .
you' ve heard no word about it ?
no .
i don' t see how it could survive the night without clothing and nourishment .
of course , like any animal  it' s not an animal , doctor .
you know that very well .
whatever it is , you can' t classify it as an animal .
it' s human , doctor .
that' s what' s disgusting to you , isn' t it ?
it kills like an animal .
and when we find it , we' il have to destroy it like one .
i don' t care .
i suppose you have to do what' s necessary .
i' m glad you feel that way .
i only hope your wife understands , as well .
what' s there to understand ?
it' s better not to think about it .
why don' t i say goodnight to your wife , and maybe i' il drive you home .
no , thanks .
okay , darling , i' il see you in the morning .
stay on this floor .
<i>police still offer no explanation for the series of five deaths ... </ i> <i>which occurred early today ... </ i> <i>at the st. george medical center in santa monica . </ i>

the bastards !
they named us .
barbara , would you come here for a minute , please ?
yes , sir ?
i' m picking up my wife at the hospital tonight .
so can you reschedule that dinner for tomorrow evening ?
i think that mr. clayton wanted to talk to you .
and about the marcus affair ....
i think we can have those cocktails at 6 : 30 at the hilton tomorrow .
he wants to approve the campaign by the end of the week .
i think you' d better see mr. clayton now .
i' il be right back .
come on in .
all right , bob .
you must be exhausted .
eaten anything ?
get frank a couple of poached eggs on an english muffin ... with a side of canadian bacon ... and a tall glass of freshly squeezed orange juice .
that should do the trick .
i don' t want you collapsing on me .
frank , don' t let it get you down .
these things happen .
at least , that' s what they say .
who' s " they " ?
i spoke to the hospital .
they give you information ?
i got connections over there .
i' m the vice chairman of the fundraising committee .
lf there' s anything i can do for you
no , thanks , bob .
i' m getting her out of there myself tonight .
you think that' s wise ?
barbara said you wanted to rap with me .
yeah , frank .
you' ve accrued three weeks vacation .
you think it would be a good idea if you took it now ?
i can' t , bob .
i' ve got the marcus account and the sturbridge campaign .
i' m just bogged down in work .
besides , i need to work , bob .
it keeps my mind off things .
frank , we' re running a public relations business here .
our job is creating an image .
right now , you' re a little controversial .
our clients want their pr men to be anonymous .
maybe after a little while , when you' re less of a celebrity ....
you' re not taking those accounts away from me , are you ?
i mean , not now .
at the last minute ?
these things happen , frank .
you know o' connors down in accounting ?
he' s got a retarded kid .
lnsists on keeping him in the house , too .
nobody thinks a thing of that .
nobody blames him .
we' re not talking about a retarded kid , and you know it .
we' re talking about a monstrosity of some kind .
maybe we' d better not talk about that .
i wouldn' t wish this on my worst enemy .
it' s just that i don' t know what to do , bob .
how to behave .
and they' re ... putting microphones in my face .
they' re asking me questions i don' t understand .
what you need is a good public relations firm ... to handle all of that for you .
that' s very funny .
this is all going to be all right , isn' t it ... when whatever this thing is is dead , right ?
maybe it already is .
why don' t you go down the service elevator ?
you won' t have to meet all those media people .
take care .
have them empty out his desk , send his personal articles to his house .
he won' t be coming back .
mr. davis , what did it look like ?
leave me alone .
i got nothing to say .
get those cameras out of my face , please .
i got no comment .
i had nothing to do with this .
will you get that goddamn thing out of my face ?
get out of the way !
i don' t know what it looks like .
never mind my baby .
leave my wife out of it , understand ?
aren' t we almost home ?
we' il be there in a few minutes .
i feel better already getting out of that terrible place .
i don' t have to take any more shots , do l ?
i don' t like taking shots .
i don' t like being made to go to sleep .
i engaged nurses in three shifts .
i' m surprised anybody would even want to work for us .
dr. norton took care of it .
good .
and i' m going to be there all the time .
what about
i told the office i had to have those three weeks vacation they owe me .
what about that marcus account ?
that was very important to you .
you' re more important .
what about chris ?
have you told him ?
does he know anything ?
i spoke to charley .
he kept him home from school .
he hasn' t told him anything .
good .
sooner or later , he' il switch on the television .
there' s only so long you can keep a secret like that .
dad , why can' t i go to school , or go out , or have any of my friends over ?
chris , i can' t tell you now , son .
you' il just have to trust me .
<i> you trust me , don' t you , son ?
sure , dad . </ i>
you have to spend all your time with charley this week .
you wouldn' t mind that .
chris , you don' t want to hurt his feelings .
i like charley , but i want to see mom and the baby .
<i> the baby' s not home yet .
ls it sick ? </ i>
that' s right , son .
the baby' s sick .
and everything here is a mess .
so it' d be much better if you stay where you are .
will you tell charley to let me watch television ?
<i> okay , put him on .
yeah , okay . </ i>
okay , frank , we' il take care of everything .
i had an idea .
what if i take chris up to the lake , do some fishing ?
okay , charley .
thank you .
and give my love to lenore .
thanks , charley .
hunting and killing babies doesn' t seem to be my specialty .
so what do you want , a transfer ?
my wife' s in her eighth month .
ever since i started on this , she hasn' t been getting any rest .
me being so involved really brings it home .
besides , i guess you know we lost our last baby .
you' re lucky you don' t have grown kids nowadays .
people without children don' t realize how lucky they are .
it' il make you feel much better .
did you see it , mrs. davis ?
surely you must have gotten one glimpse .
they say it has teeth and claws .
did you know that ?
how should i know that ?
were you aware that it killed another person just last night ?
a musician over on santa monica boulevard .
he was on his way home from work about 2 : 00 a . m ... and that was the last anybody saw of him .
they found him in an alley .
they can' t be sure that it was ....
there' s no doubt about it .
the wounds are the same as the doctor and nurses suffered .
what do you want me to say ?
just say anything you feel .
what' s under that napkin ?
there' s nothing there .
a recorder !
a tape recorder !
i' m a nurse .
you can tell me anything .
who are you working for ?
i really am a registered nurse , and i write a little on the side .
she' s taking interviews on a tape recorder .
get out .
we have to get rid of everybody .
let' s not have any more nurses , honey .
all right .
we' il let them all go .
should have known better ... than to trust anybody .
actually , already in excess of $100, 000 ... has been allocated by the university ... for examination of this phenomenon .
we have some of the leading men in the field .
and it is hoped that this might lead to a breakthrough ... to a better understanding of why mutations occur .
you want to experiment on it , is that it ?
ln fact , my department has already cautioned the police ... about excessive violence .
lf it could be dispatched with a bullet , or better still , some kind of a gas ....
undoubtedly , it is very small and any kind of bodily harm ... especially from gunshots or explosives ....
ln other words , you want me to sign away the body , is that it ?
it' s your right .
after all , you are the child' s father .
it' s not my child .
that' s very wise .
to disassociate yourself emotionally .
just sign each copy , please .
pen ?
give him a pen .
it seems that out of every tragedy , out of every evil ... some good can come , if we only apply ourselves .
i suppose that' s going to be in all the medical journals ... the history books .
the davis child .
the davis monster .
it' s like frankenstein .
ln my opinion , this will be remembered long after each of us is forgotten .
when i was a kid , i always thought the monster was frankenstein .
karloff walking around in these big shoes , grunting .
i thought he was frankenstein .
then i went to high school and read the book ... and i realized that ...
frankenstein was ... the doctor who created him .
somehow , the identities ... get all mixed up , don' t they ?
one must not allow oneself to be impressed by escapist fiction .
you forgot one .
pen .
frank , darling .
hi , darling .
mrs. davis , i don' t suppose you took the pills i gave you ?
you really should .
maybe it' s all the pills i' ve been taking over the years that brought this on .
you really shouldn' t be downstairs .
maybe you' d both like to have dinner with us .
i have some wonderful lamb chops in the refrigerator .
no , i' m afraid not .
honey , why don' t you go down to the basement ... and get a bottle of that nice beaujolais ?
won' t that go nicely with the lamb chops ?
we have quite an extensive wine cellar .
it' s one of frank' s many hobbies .
my husband' s a many faceted man .
i' il show these gentlemen to the door .
i' il get that wine .
great .
good .
that basement' s filthy .
how long has she been taking birth control pills before this pregnancy ?
thirty one months .
you realize ... that i came from the east specifically for this matter ?
i realize that it is a police problem ... but once the thing is killed , it becomes a medical problem .
now , you are in charge of that department , no doubt ?
yes , i suppose so .
nobody knows how this thing happened .
it' s really a matter of speculation , and i think perhaps that' s for the best .
after all , if we find out ... that the cause is medication that we manufacture ... and it was administered over a long period of time ... it' d be bad for you and worse for us .
we' re susceptible to lawsuits .
people will think the government hadn' t tested and approved of those products ... that we put out on the market .
what do your interests recommend ?
absolute destruction of this thing .
but we' ve already signed over the remains to the university .
but if there was nothing left of it , you know ... we would be most grateful to you .
you have had a very successful career ... until this freak incident .
it could work out for the best .
we have an opening ... on the board of our research and development department .
we wouldn' t want people to lose faith in us , would we ?
<i> hello ?
dr. norton , please . </ i>
dr. norton' s stepped out for a moment .
may i take a message ?
<i>tell him they' ve cornered the infant at the hawthorne school ... </ i> <i>in west los angeles . </ i>
that' s just a few blocks from here .
<i>ask the doctor to get over there if he can .
thank you . </ i>
i have to go out .
all right .
you don' t mind staying alone ?
i' il keep everything warm .
wait a minute , i' m frank davis .
i want to see lt. perkins .
all right .
take him .
wonder what' s the matter with him .
screwed up genes or something .
wait here .
davis , how the hell did you find out about this ?
there was a phone call for dr. norton .
i took the message .
my son , chris , goes to school here .
i' ve been here a million times , pta meetings .
your kid goes here ?
sure , that' s right .
he' s in the sixth grade .
probably just a coincidence .
look , perkins , i want this thing destroyed as much as anybody else .
i realize that .
yeah , you realize .
then why is everybody looking at me ?
like it' s my own flesh and blood or something .
well , it' s not !
you understand ?
it' s no relation to me !
nobody is looking at you .
say , you have my deepest sympathy .
you and your wife .
ls it all right if your driver drops me off a block from my home ?
i don' t want my wife to see me .
you don' t want her to know you were here tonight ?
i don' t think she' d know how to take it .
i don' t know .
maybe i didn' t do the right thing .
i was just trying to show everybody i feel the same way they do .
i' m no different from anybody else .
we know that .
i got a boy 1 1 years old .
he' s perfectly healthy , brilliant in school .
mr. davis , you don' t have to keep telling us that .
we realize that .
look , i got to go back on duty .
take him wherever he wants to go .
davis said his kid went to this school .
why , in all of los angeles , would it happen to show up here ?
maybe it' s looking for somebody .
i' d like us to all get together again and be a family .
i' m really trying very hard , frank .
i can see that .
wouldn' t it be a great idea to bring chris home ?
he' s better off where he is .
lenore , did you go out ?
for christ' s sakes , answer me .
are you feeling better ?
where the hell have you been ?
i' ve been straightening  i' ve been calling you .
been all over the house , straightening up .
where ?
you weren' t downstairs , and you didn' t hear me calling you ?
honey , there' s a good movie on tonight .
it' s with paul newman .
i gotta get something in my stomach .
excuse me .
chris come back here today ?
i said , has chris been back here today ?
i don' t know .
why do you say that ?
you wouldn' t lie to me ?
i know you wanted chris to come back , but i specifically told you ....
chris , are you hiding someplace ?
don' t fool around now .
i wish somebody would respect my feelings around here .
why are you watching that stuff ?
i thought you wanted to watch a movie .
who are you calling ?
please don' t call anybody !
<i>how' s chris ? </ i>
i' ve had a hell of a time keeping him away from the newscasts and the daily papers .
but the teacher sent some schoolwork , so he' s been keeping busy .
you' ve been with him all the time , then ?
what are you talking about ?
we just went fishing .
he hasn' t been out of my sight for a minute .
you want to talk to him ?
no , i don' t want to talk to him .
hi , dad , when can i come home ?
chris , did you come back here today ?
ls the baby home from the hospital yet ?
did i do anything wrong ?
how about something to eat ?
i' m not hungry .
i want to go to bed .
i' m sorry , charley .
i' m not mad at you .
that' s okay , kid .
honey , i want you to make love to me .
i want you to hold me and love me .
you know , there are other ways .
come on , sweetheart .
there' s no ice in there .
i' il get the ice .
wait a minute .
oh , my god .
what were you doing down in the basement ?
you know .
what' re you going to do ?
what' re you doing ?
why are you so anxious to be the one to do it ?
who is it ?
mom ?
dad ?
frank , wait .
he could have killed you when you were sleeping !
he could have killed you .
you know why he didn' t ?
hello .
he knows you' re his father .
no , you' re crazy .
he knows .
he does .
he knows you' re his father .
don' t worry .
don' t be scared .
i' il protect you .
it' s a boy , you know .
it' s a boy .
i' il protect you .
chris , look out .
i hit it .
i' m sure i hit it .
charley , look out !
come on , get back !
did you see it ?
what does it look like ?
it' s no relation to us , chris .
it can' t be .
see what your baby did to charley .
what did you do ?
tell him about the doctors in the hospital !
lenore , take my son upstairs .
your dad was trying to suffocate your little brother .
he just wants to ....
you should have called us ... as soon as you began to suspect it was somewhere near the house .
it' s lost a lot of blood .
it' s my opinion that our troubles are very nearly over .
so shall we go ?
and leave some men here ... in case it decides to double back to the house .
i would like to go with you .
haven' t you done enough already ?
no .
not yet .
you have to be the one to do it , don' t you ?
have you seen it ?
got a real good look at it ?
it was too dark .
it wouldn' t matter .
i could do it .
you may have done it already , if it doesn' t stop bleeding .
will you excuse us for a moment , please ?
wait a second .
we just can' t take  i advise you to let him come along .
after all , it found its way home by itself .
and it may be that it will search out its father ... especially now that he put a bullet in it .
what have we got to lose ?
one more life .
you know how to use a gun ?
beg your pardon ?
do you know how to use a rifle ?
sure .
we' il issue you one for your own protection .
okay .
<i>the shots that wounded the infant were fired not by the police ... </ i> <i>but by its father . </ i>
