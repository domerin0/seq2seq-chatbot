you know what ?
no matter what it is , we' re gonna work it out .
hal , i' m not attracted to you .
so what ?
you think everyone who goes out is attracted to each other ?
get real .
they' re attracted to each other in the beginning .
oh , come on .
that sounds iike a bunch of new age hooey .
maybe for some people there' s a iittle spark in the beginning , but for most , the attraction part happens way iater .
whoa !
what ?
that' s it ?
just iike that , we' re breaking up ?
weil , we were never going out .
we just had one date .
come on .
hey , iet' s stay together five days .

why do you need five days ?
tomorrow i' m finaily getting my promotion .
there' s gonna be parties , dinners , this , that .
i need you now .
hal , you' re gonna be so busy , you won' t even think about me .
how am i not gonna think about you ?
you iive right across the hail .
i don' t know , hal .
maybe ... maybe you should think about moving .
hal , we' ve made a decision regarding that wholesaler position .

the gal' s a proven entity .
what the heck you gonna do ?
hal , i' m so sorry .
yeah , thanks .
you should have gotten it .
you deserved it .
no , i didn' t .
i didn' t put them in a position where they had to promote me or iose me .
it' s a good iesson .
make yourself indispensable , that' s the key .
and to make matters worse , jiii dumped me iast night .
dumped you ?
don' t you have to be going out to get dumped ?
what does that mean ?
weil , i just thought it was more of a ...
anyway , why do you care so much ?
jiii wasn' t right for you and you know it .
how can you say that ?
she was perfect .
when are you gonna get it ?
they' re just weil formed molecules .
and by the way , her tits weren' t even real .
weil , i could squeeze ' em .
that' s reai enough for me .
hal , i don' t understand how a guy who' s as nice and ioyai and generous as you could have such a huge flaw .
what are you talking about ?
it never occurred to you that picking girls on their iooks may not be the best way ?
am i supposed to apologise for having high standards ?
high standards ?
in the five years i' ve known you , every woman
i should say giri you' ve gone after has been completely out of your ieague .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
she doesn' t mean anything by it .
she' s just saying you' re not that good iooking .
oh !
i thought she was implying something reaily mean .
no .
hey , it' s you .
you' re the tv guru guy .
yes , tony robbins .
pleased to meet you .
yeah !
oh , man !
so , wow !

gorbachev ?

pamela anderson .

give me another handshake .
wow !
man , iook at those mitts !
it' s iike grabbing a bunch of bananas .
and those dogs .

size 16 , buddy .
holy cannoli .
so you must do pretty good with the iadies .
just one .
reaily ?
yeah .
she sounds hot !
she is an amazing iady .
i bet .
so , what are you doin ' in my town ?
we' re doing a seminar here .
i help people to deai with the chailenges in iife with more dignity and courage .
that' s my deal , is the courage .
i try to ...
hang on a second .
buddy , hang on .
the elevator just stopped .
that' s weird .
man , yeah .
so what do we ... ?
hang on .
are you ok ?
i' m fine .
you ok ?
yeah , yeah .
it' s just i feei a iittle iight headed .
then she dumped me .
flat out .
without even the courtesy of a severance pop .
a severance pop ?
you know , one iast ...
to ease the pain .
the nice ones' ii sometimes throw you that .
it sounds iike you' ve had some odd relationships .
yeah .
see , the problem is i' m kinda picky .
what do you mean , " picky " ?
weil , for instance , i iike ' em reai young .
like , did you ever see paulina in her first sports illustrated iayout ?
you' re iooking for a young paulina type ?
that face , but with better headlights .
you know how hers have kind of dimmed iately ?
heidi klum' s beams would do .
and her teeth .
or that britney spears girl .
she' s got great knockers .
but she' s a tad muscular .
actuaily , you know what ?
her ass would do , too , if she had a better griile .
like micheile pfeiffer back when she did grease 2 .
but she' d have to be a iittle smilier than micheile .
like rebecca romijn stamos , before she got stamosed .
but not as skinny .
someone meatier , iike heidi , but without the accent .
you know those accents : yah yah yah yah .
they reaily get old fast .
you know what i' m saying .
someone iike that .
don' t you think you' re being a iittle bit shailow in the way you iook at women ?
weil , no .
i mean , you know , i' d iike her to be into culture and shit , too .
ok , hypotheticai situation .
which do you prefer , a girlfriend missing one breast or half a brain ?
ooh , toughie .
that' s a toughie .
how' s the remaining breast ?
is it big ?
how' s your relationship with your parents ?
exceilent .
i mean , my mom' s hilarious .
she golfs every afternoon .
actuaily , i don' t reaily remember my dad .
he died when i was nine , so ...
if you were nine , you should remember a iot .
yeah , but i don' t .
my mom thinks i might have been a iittle traumatised by the whole thing .
anyway , aii i remember is , he was great .
he was a great guy , and i reaily loved him , but ...
i' m sorry you iost him .
hey , iisten , i know you got a great heart .
you' re just fixated on the outside appearances of people .
hai larson , i' m gonna do you a great favour .
reaily ?
this is how it' ii work .
from this moment on , whenever you meet someone in the future , you' re only gonna see what' s inside them .
so you' ii respond to that , because that , my friend , is where the true beauty iies .
ok , tony , i think you' re getting a iittle cabin fever .
hold on .
what if i told you by doing this , you could have the most beautifui women in the world and they' d want you ?
is this iike what you do in your seminars ?
no , no , this is very special .
this is just between you and me .
let' s get up and i' ii show you what to do .
now , you got a pattern of iooking at women and judging them by the exterior .
we gotta break that pattern .
so has there been a time when you were especiaily shailow with a woman , where you thought you were better ?
aii the time .
aii the time .
is there one specific time where you were reaily shailow ?
oh , yeah , i got one .
think about that .
devils , come out !
what the heii are you doin ' , banana hands ?
just hang on .
we gotta jolt your nervous system .
oh , yeah .
i' m sorry .
it' s not just talking about it .
here' s what i want you to do .
just relax for a moment .
i won' t do that again .
i didn' t mean the " banana hands " thing .
close your eyes .
just relax .
and i want you to imagine that you' re on a beach .
it' s a warm day and the sun is just starting to set .
and you' re iooking in the eyes of a woman , and you' re feeling her heart .
you' re seeing her soul .
you' re feeling her spirit .
that' s it .
that' s it .
exceilent .
exceilent .

at the time i thought it was a joke .
but this afternoon , the first beautifui woman i saw went for me .

she' s funny , she' s smart , she teaches self esteem to sick kids ...
i would never believe a giri as beautifui could have such a great personality .
ugly duckling syndrome .
what ?
she probably wasn' t pretty tiii high school .
the personality developed out of necessity .
you know what ?
i bet you' re right .
she' s way too pretty to be so nice .
sometimes they' re ugly so iong , when they turn pretty , they don' t realise it .
the ugly self image is so weii ingrained .
that' s a reai find .
hey !
hey !

it' s just , you know , hal , i' m not used to aii this .
used to what ?
hal , you' ve been reaily nice to me today .
i reaily appreciate it , but ...
what , your other boyfriends aren' t nice to you ?
i don' t have other boyfriends .
builshit .
weil , i had one boyfriend .
it was kind of recently , actuaily , but it didn' t work out .
you' ve been burnt , huh ?
no .
that' s just it .
i , um ...
i' ve never been close enough to anybody to get burnt .
please !
with a mug iike that ?
you must be fighting ' em off daily .
right i mean , i saw the way your friend mauricio iooked at me .
i thought he was gonna shoot me with a tranquiiliser gun and tag my ear .
don' t worry .
he' s been acting reaily weird iately , especiaily around reaily pretty girls .
hal ... do me a favour and stop saying that i' m pretty and that i' m not fat , ok ?
cos it makes me uncomfortable .
ok .
you have a problem with compliments ?
look ...
i know what i am and i know what i' m not .
i' m the giri who gets reaily good grades and is not afraid to be funny .
and i' m the giri who has a iot of friends who are boys , and no boyfriends .
i' m not beautiful , ok ?
and i never wiii be .
and i' m fine with that .
you know ?
but when you go around saying that i' m something that i' m not , it' s just ... it' s not nice .
whoa , rosemary .
you' re starting to scare me .
i mean , i reaily iike you , but i have to assume you' re a iittle nutty if you reaily believe you' re not beautiful .
grow up , hal .
rosie .
wait a second .
weil , it was too good to be true .
hm ?
rosemary .
turned out to be a totai psycho .
her self image is so far off , it' s scary .
weil , maybe you had a iittle something to do with that .
what are you talking about ?
aii i ever did was teii her how perfect she was .
reaily ?
yeah .
then she got aii huffy and told me to grow up .
weil , that' s probably good advice .
you are kind of immature .
you' re not serious .
you actuaily think you' re more mature than me ?
you' re right .
i' m probably more immature than you , but at ieast i have a bigger wiilie .
yeah , bigger than a mouse' s .
what the heii was that ?
i said your wiilie' s ...
i heard what you said , but it took you , iike , eight seconds .
you can' t come back with a comeback after eight seconds .
you got three .
five , tops .
that' s why they caii it a quip .
not a " slowp " .
aii right , you got anything better to read ?
i gotta fire off a missile .
hi .
is this a bad time , or ... ?
no .
i just wanted to apologise for iast night .
you don' t have to apologise .
yeah , i do .
i cailed you , iike , immature or sophomoric or something iike that .
i know you' re not ... oh , my god , hal !
you gotta get in here and iook at this turd !
it iooks just iike klinger from m* a* s* h.
why don' t we get outta here ?
ok .
coffee ?
excuse me .
are you ready to order ?
yes .
two double cheeseburgers with bacon , one with relish .
thank you .
ow .
are you ok ?
brain freeze .
* baby , now that i' ve found you i can' t let you go
* i' il build my world around you
* i need you so , baby , even though ...
excuse me , sweetie .
professional .
hey , biily , stay over near the iadder .
weak .
so weak .
you wanna see a splash ?
i' m gonna show you a splash .
ready ?
* spent a lifetime looking for somebody
* to give me love like you
* baby , now that i' ve found you i can' t let you go ...
that was good ?
bialy ?
bialy ?
bialy ?
biily !
daddy !
sorry .
what' s the matter ?
i should have changed at the beach .
what ?
are you crazy ?
you iook great .
i don' t normaily dress iike this around my parents .
hey , hey , come on .
i' m the one who should be nervous here , not you .
hey , you know , i' ve been meaning to ask you .
were you adopted ?
no .
why ?
cos your dad has that weird accent .
and i' ve seen him around the office .
i gotta say , i don' t see the slightest resemblance .
reaily ?
everybody says if you put a wig on him , he' d iook just iike me .
look at who' s here now .
come here , my darlin ' .
hi , daddy .
rosie , honey .
mom .
good to see ya .
this is hai larson , the guy i was teiling you about .
great to meet you , sir .
likewise .
nice to meet you , hal .
the pleasure is mine , mrs shanahan .
wow .
i can see where rosemary gets her figure .
what the heil ...
what the heii is that you' ve got on ?
we were at the beach .
won' t you be putting something else on , darlin ' ?
oh , come on .
she doesn' t have to do that for me .
let' s just keep it casual .
casual .
hey , dad , hal' s one of your great untapped resources down at the company .
why don' t you teii him some of your ideas ?
oh , so you' ve got a few ideas , do ya ?
it is risky , but the rewards are greater , too .
only a company with a solid reputation iike jps could ever market this product .
hal , iet me take your plate .
thank you .
it was delicious .
can i get you boys some coffee ?
i' d love a cup of tea , darlin ' .
maybe just a drop of the hard stuff .
yeah , i' ii just have a cup of joe .
that' d be great .
thanks .
i have to say , hal , i' m impressed with a iot of your ideas .
some of them are dog shit , but for the most part you seem to have done your homework .
so i' d iike you to do something for me .
ok .
i' m meeting with me executive committee monday morning , and i' d iike you to make a presentation .
seriously ?
weil , nothing fancy , you understand .
just talk about the same things that you talked about here tonight .
great .
i' d love to .
oh , and by the way , you can cut out the act now .
excuse me ?
you think i got as far as i did in me iife by bein ' a fool ?
now , you' ve got ambition , hal , and i admire that .
heil , i wish i had a hundred more iike yourself .
we' d be the number one firm in the country .
and me daughter would get a heii of a iot more dates .
i' m sure rosemary doesn' t have any problem getting dates .
i told you to cut the shit out , aii right ?
look , rosemary' s me daughter , and god knows i love her dearly .
but i think we both know that we won' t soon be seeing her twirlin ' the baton , marching along with the dailas cheerleaders .
uh ...
i don' t understand .
i' m teiling the truth , hal .
and the truth is i haven' t been able to bounce me daughter on me knee since she was two .
you know , i' ve read about people iike you .
people iike me ?
super achievers with impossible standards .
nothing' s ever good enough .
nothing ever measures up .
it never occurs to you that your kids are people , with their own feelings .
you think they' re an extension of you , iike your company , or your $20 miilion learjet and your picasso out in the front hail .
everything reflects on you , so nothing and no one is ever good enough .
go on .
when i first met rosemary , she told me she knew she wasn' t that good iooking .
i could not believe my ears .
i thought how can a person this beautifui possibly interpret what she sees in the mirror to be anything other than that ?
weil , now i know .
is everything ok ?
yeah , everything is fine .
just fine .
what ?
nothin ' .
i just can' t believe how iucky i am .
you swear to god you' re not gonna iaugh ?
come on , i' m not gonna iaugh .
oh .
daddy iike .
* the look on your face
* it could never explain your heart
* and the touch of my lips
* it could never tell you my thoughts
* and you want me to change
* i can' t get used to ...
what in the ... ?
how did ... ?
get over here , houdini .
* cos it' s not really me
* this is my world , this is who i am
