on the clearest of nights when the winds of the etherium were calm and peaceful
the great merchant ships with their cargoes of arcturian sura crystals felt safe and secure
little did they suspect that they were pursued by pirates
and the most feared of all these pirates was the notorious captain nathaniel flint

james pleiades hawkins !

go !
go !
that' s it !
that' s it !
go !
hyah !
hyah !
i just spoke with the constabulary
those blaggard pirates have fled without a trace
i' m sorry , sarah .
i' m afraid the old benbow lnn has burned to the ground .
ahem .
well , certainly a lot of trouble ... over that odd little sphere .
those markings baffle me
unlike anything i' ve ever encountered
even with my vast experience and superior intellect it would take me years to unlock its hey !
why , it' s a map !
wait .
wait , wait , wait !
this is us , the planet montressor .
that' s the magellanic cloud !
whoo !
the coral galaxy !
oh !
that' s the cygnus cross and that' s the kerian abyss .
wait .
what' s this ?
what' s this ?
why , it it' s ...
treasure planet .
no !
that' s treasure planet !
flint' s trove ?
the loot of a thousand worlds ?
you know what this means ?
it means that all that treasure is only a boat ride away .
whoever brings it back would hold an eternal place ... atop the pantheon of explorers !
he' d be able to experience
whoo !
what just happened ?
mom , this is it .
this is the answer to all our problems .
jim , there is absolutely no way
don' t you remember , all those stories ?
that' s all they were stories !
with that treasure ... we could rebuild the benbow a hundred times over !
well , this is it' s just oh , my .
delbert , would you please explain how ridiculous this is ?
it' s totally preposterous ... traversing the entire galaxy alone .
now at last , we hear some sense !
that' s why i' m going with you .
delbert !
i' il use my savings to finance the expedition .
i' il commission a ship , hire a captain and a crew .
you' re not serious .
all my life i' ve been waiting for an opportunity like this ... and here it is screaming , " go , delbert !
go , delbert !
ok .
ok !
you' re both grounded !
mom . look
i know that i keep messing everything up ... and i know ... that i let you down .
but this is my chance to make it up to you .
i' m gonna set things right .
sarah ?
lf i may ?
you said yourself , you' ve tried everything .
there are much worse remedies ... than a few character building months in space .
are you saying this because it' s the right thing ... or because you really want to go ?
i really , really , really , really want to go ... and it' s the right thing .
jim ...
i don' t want to lose you .
mom ... you won' t .
i' il make you proud .
well . uh . ahem
there we are then .
we' il begin preparations at once .
jim , my boy , soon we' il be off to the spaceport .
jim !
oh .
jim !
wait for me !
well , jim , this should be a wonderful opportunity ... for the two of us to get to know one another .
you know what they say , familiarity breeds , um ... well , contempt , but , in our case
look , let' s just find the ship .
ok ?
second berth on your right !
you can' t miss it .
hey , thanks .
it' s the suit , isn' t it ?
i should never have listened ... to that pushy two headed saleswoman .
this one said it fit , that one said it was my color .
i didn' t know what to do .
i get so flustered .
ooh !
oh , jim !
this is our ship !
the r. l. s. legacy !
whoa !
stow those casks foward !
heave together now !
how cool is this ?
sorry about that .
i didn' t mean
allow me to handle this .
i' m fluent in flatula , jim .
took two years of it in high school .
flatula ?
cool .
good morning , captain .
everything shipshape ?
shipshape it is , sir , but i' m not the captain .
the captain' s aloft .
mr. arrow , i' ve checked this miserable ship ... from stem to stern , and , as usual , it' s ... spot on .
can you get nothing wrong ?
you flatter me , captain .
ah , dr. doppler , i presume ?
uh , um , yes . l
hello !
can you hear me ?
yes , i can !
stop that banging !
lf i may , doctor , this works so much better ... when it' s right way up and plugged in .
ooh !
lovely .
there you go .
lf you don' t mind , i can manage my own plugging !
i' m captain amelia ...
late of a few run ins with the protean armada .
nasty business , but i won' t bore you with my scars .
you' ve met my first officer , mr. arrow .
sterling , tough , dependable , honest , brave , and true .
please , captain .
oh , shut up , arrow .
you know i don' t mean a word of it .
ahem , excuse me .
i hate to interrupt this lovely banter ... but may i introduce to you , jim hawkins ?
jim , you see , is the boy who found the treasure
doctor , please !
i' d like a word with you in my stateroom .
doctor , to muse and blabber about a treasure map ... in front of this particular crew ... demonstrates a level of ineptitude ... that borders on the imbecilic ... and i mean that in a very caring way .
lmbecilic , did you say ?
foolishness , i' ve
may i see the map , please ?
here .
hmm .
fascinating .
mr. hawkins , in the future ... you will address me as " captain " or " ma' am .
ls that clear ?
ugh ...
mr. hawkins ?
yes , ma' am .
that' il do .
gentlemen , this must be kept under lock and key ... when not in use .
and , doctor , again ... with the greatest possible respect ... zip your howling screamer .
captain , i assure you l
let me make this as monosyilabic as possible .
i don' t much care for this crew you hired .
they' re ... how did i describe them , arrow ?
i said something rather good this morning before coffee .
a ludicrous parcel of driveling galoots , " ma' am .
there you go poetry .
now , see here
doctor , i' d love to chat tea , cake , the whole shebang but i have a ship to launch ... and you' ve got your outfit to buff up .
mr. arrow , please escort these two neophytes ... down to the galley straightaway .
young hawkins will be working for our cook , mr. silver .
what ?
the cook ?
that woman !
that ... feline !
who does she think is working for whom ?
it' s my map , and she' s got me bussin ' tables ?
i' il not tolerate a cross word about our captain !
there' s no finer officer in this or any galaxy .
mr silver ?
why , mr. arrow , sir .
bringin ' in such fine and distinguished gents to grace my humble galley .
had i known , i' d have tucked in me shirt .
heh heh heh heh !
a cyborg !
may i introduce dr. doppler ?
the financier of our voyage .
love the outfit , doc .
well , thank you .
um , love the eye .
uh , this young lad is jim hawkins .
jimbo !
uh ...
aw , now , don' t be too put off by this hunk of hardware .
whoa !

mmm !

i can' t say as i have , jimbo .
come to think of it , just before i left ...
i met this old guy , who was , um ... he was kind of looking for a cyborg buddy of his .

yeah .
what was that old salamander' s name ?
oh , yeah .
bones .
billy bones ?
bones ?
bones ? !
mm mmm .
t' ain' t ringin ' any bells .

there' s a slew of cyborgs roamin ' this port .
prepare to cast off !
eh , off with you , lad , and watch the launch .
there' il be plenty work a waitin ' for you afterwards .
we best be keepin ' a sharp eye on this one , eh , morph ?
we wouldn' t want him strayin ' into things he shouldn' t .

uh , doctor , i' d stand clear
ha .
ah . ' tis a grand day for sailing .
captain and look at you
you' re as trim and as bonny as a sloop with new sails and a fresh coat of paint
you can keep that kind of flim flammery ... for your spaceport floozies , silver .
spaceport floozy , spaceport floozy
you cut me to the quick , captain .
i speaks nothing but me heart at all times .
nothing but me heat
and , by the way , isn' t that your cabin boy ... aimlessly footling about in those shrouds ?
yep , it oh ...
a momentary aberration , cap' n , soon to be addressed .
jimbo !
i got two new friends i' d like you to meet .
say hello to mr. mop and mrs. bucket .
heh heh heh heh !
yippie .
yeah , i got your mr. mop .
watch it , twerp .
what are you looking at , weirdo ?
yeah , weirdo .
cabin boys should learn to mind their own business .
why ?
you got something to hide , bright eyes ?
maybe your ears don' t work so well .
yeah .
ahem .
too bad my nose works just fine .
why , you impudent little
go ahead !
slice him !
dice him !
any last words , cabin boy ?
mr. scroop ...
you ever see what happens to a fresh purp ... when you squeeze real hard ?
what' s all this . then ?
you know the rules .
there' il be no brawling on this ship .
aye , aye , sir .
any further offenders will be confined to the brig ... for the remainder of the voyage .
am i clear , mr. scroop ?
transparently .
well done , mr. arrow , sir !
a tight ship' s a happy ship , sir .
jimbo , i gave you a job .
hey , i was doing it until that bug thing
belay that !
now , i want this deck swabbed spotless ... and heaven help you if i come back and it' s not done .
morph ?
keep an eye on this pup ... and let me know if there be any more distractions .
so , we' re all here , then .
excuse me .
fine .
now , if you pardon my plain speaking , gentlemen ... are you all ... stark raving , totally blinking daft ? !
after all me finagling getting us hired ... as an upstanding crew ... you want to blow the whole mutiny before it' s time ?
the boy was sniffing about .
you just stick to the plan , you bug brained twit .
as for the boy , i' il run him so ragged ... he won' t have time to think .
well , this has been a fun day , huh ?
making new friends like that spider psycho .
spider psycho , spider psycho .
heh .
a little uglier .
mwah ha ha ha !
pretty close .
well thank heavens for little miracles .
up here for an hour ... and the deck' s still in one piece .
um , look , i , uh ...
what you did ...
thanks .
didn' t your pap ever teach you ... to pick your fights a bit more carefully ?
your father' s not the teachin ' sort .
no .
he was more the taking off and never coming back sort .
oh .
sorry , lad .
hey , no big deal .
i' m doing just fine .

like it or not , i' il be pounding a few skills ... into that thick head of yours to keep you out of trouble .
what ?
from now on ...
i' m not letting you out of me sight .
you can' t do
you won' t so much as eat , sleep ... or scratch your bum without my say so .
don' t do me any favors !
oh , you can be sure of that , my lad .
you can be sure of that .
heh heh heh heh !

or a moment that' s held in your arms
and what do you think you' d ever say
i won' t listen anyway
you don' t know me
and i' il never be what you want
made of pain
and what do you think you' d understand ?
i' m a boy . no .
i' m a man
you can take me and throw me away
and how can you learn what' s never shown
yeah . you stand here on your own
they don' t know me
' cause i' m not here
and i want a moment to be real
want to touch things i don' t feel
want to hold on and feel i belong

and you see the things they never see
all you wanted .
i could be
now you know me
and i' m not afraid
and i want to tell you who i am
can you help me be a man ?
they can' t break me
as long as i know who i am
they can' t tell me who to be
' cause i' m not what they see
yeah . the world is still sleeping
while i keep on dreaming for me
and the words are just whispers and lies
that i' il never believe
and i want a moment to be real

hmm .
oh , thank you , morphy .

i got to find a place to hide , and there' s pirates chasing me .

i don' t like them .
i remember captain flint .
this guy had such a temper .

you knew captain flint ?
i think he suffered from mood swings , personally .
i' m not a therapist , and anyway ... but l you let me know when i' m rambling .
but that means but wait .
but then you gotta know about the treasure ?
treasure ?
yeah , flint' s trove ?
you know , loot of a thousand worlds .
it' s well , it' s ... it' s all a little little little fuzzy .
wait . l i r r remember .
i do . l treasure !
lots of treasure buried in the centroid centroid centroid of the mechanism .
and there was this big door opening and closing ... and opening and closing ... and captain flint wanted to make sure ... nobody could ever get to his treasure ... so i helped him ...
aah !
data inaccessible !
reboot !
ben ?
ben ?
ben !
reboot !
aah !
and you are ?
wait , wait , wait !
what about the treasure ?
i want to say larry .
the the centroid of the mechanism , or
i' m sorry .
my memory isn' t what it used to be .
i' ve lost my mind .
ha ha !
i' ve lost my mind .
you haven' t found it , have you ?
uh , my missing piece ?
my primary memory circuit ?
look , b. e. n. , i really need to find a place to hide , ok ?
so i' m just gonna be , you know , moving on .
oh , uh , so , well , then ...
i guess , uh ... this is good bye , huh ?
i' m sorry that i' m so dysfunctional .
so , uh , go ahead and ...

huzzah !
ha ha ha !
oh , this is fantastic !
me and my best buddy are lookin ' for a ...
being quiet .
and you have to stop touching me .
touching and talking .
that' s my two big no nos .
ok .
now , i think that we should
say , listen , before we go out on our big search ... um , would you mind if we made a quick pit stop at my place ?
kind of urgent .
ben .
i think you just solved my problem
uh . pardon the mess . people
you' d think in a hundred years ...
i would' ve dusted a little more often ... but , you know , when you' re batchin ' it ... you tend to , uh , let things go .
aw , isn' t that sweet ?
i find old fashioned romance so touching , don' t you ?
how about drinks for the happy couple ?
oh , uh , ooh .
uh , no .
thank you , we don' t drink ... and , uh , we' re not a couple .
ahem .
look at these markings .
they' re identical to the ones on the map .
i suspect these are the hieroglyphic remnants ... of an ancient culture .
mr hawkins stop anyone who tries to approach .
ohh !
yes , yes .
now listen to me ... stop giving orders for a few milliseconds and lie still .
very forceful , doctor .
go on .
say something else .
hey . look !
there' s some more of your buddies !
hey , fellas !
we' re over here , fellas !
oh !
uhh !
ooh !
ohh !
stop wastin ' your fire !
hello . up there !
jimbo ?
lf it' s all right with the captain ...
i' d like a short word with ya .
no tricks , just a little palaver .
come to bargain for the map , doubtless .
pestilential ...
ugh !
captain .
that means ... that he thinks we still have it .
ah , morphy !
i wondered where you was off to .
oh , this poor old leg' s downright snarky ... since that game attack we had in the galley .
ahh .
whatever you heard back there ... at least the part concerning you ...
i didn' t mean a word of it .
had that bloodthirsty lot thought i' d gone soft ... they' d have gutted us both .
listen to me .
lf we play our cards right ... we can both walk away from this rich as kings .
yeah ?
ha ha ha .
you get me that map ... and , uh ... an even portion of the treasure is yours .
no .
you are really something .
all that talk of greatness ...
light coming off my sails ... what a joke .
now , just see here , jimbo
i mean , at least you taught me one thing .
stick to it , right ?
well , that' s just what i' m gonna do .
i' m gonna make sure that you never see ... one drabloon of my treasure !
that treasure is owed me , by thunder !
well , try to find it without my map , by thunder !
oh , you still don' t know how to pick your fights , do you , boy ?
now , mark me .
either i get that map by dawn tomorrow ... or so help me , i' il use the ship' s cannons ... to blast ya all to kingdom come !
morph , hop to it .
now !
oh , blast it !
gentlemen ... we must stay together and ... and ... ohh .
and what ?
what ? !
we must stay together and what ? !
doctor , you have wonderful eyes .
she' s lost her mind !
well , you gotta help her .
dang it , jim .
i' m an astronomer , not a doctor .
i mean , i am a doctor , but i' m not that kind of doctor .
i have a doctorate .
it' s not the same thing .
you can' t help people with a doctorate .
you just sit there , and you' re useless .
it' s ok , doc .
it' s all right .
yeah , doc !
jimmy knows exactly how to get out of this .
it' s just jimmy has this knowledge of things .
jim , any thoughts at all ?
without the map , we' re dead .
lf we try to leave , we' re dead .
lf we stay here  we' re dead !
we' re dead !
we' re dead !
well , i think that jimmy could use a little quiet time .
heh .
so i' il just slip out the back door .
back door ?
oh , yeah .
i get this delightful breeze through here ... which i think is important ... because ventilation among friends
whoa what is all this stuff ?
you mean the miles and miles of machinery that run through the entire course of the inside of this planet ?
not a clue .
hey , doc !
doc !
i think i found a way out of here !
no , no .
jim , wait .
the captain ordered us to stay
i' il be back .
cannonball !
woof .
so , what' s the plan ?
shh .
b. e. n. , quiet .
ok , here it is .
we sneak back to the legacy , disable the laser cannons ... and bring back the map .
that' s a good plan .
i like that plan .
the only thing is ...
i' m wondering , how do we get there ?
on that .
ooh .
oop ?
aah !
ben . shh !
sorry . sorry sorry
ok , i' il get the map .
you wait here .
roger , jimmy .
i' il neutralize laser cannons , sir !
b. e. n. !
b. e. n. !
yo ho . yo ho . a pirate' s life for me
disable a few laser cannons .
what is the big deal ?
all we gotta do is find that one little wire .
oh , mama .
yes .
bad , b. e. n. bad .
ok , fixing .
that stupid robot' s gonna get us all ... killed .
cabin boy .
aah !
whoops ok . don' t panic
breathing in breathing out
this has gotta be cannons .

come on , come on , come on .
no !
oh , yes .
do say hello to mr. arrow .

back you go , you naughty plug !
oh !
unh !
morph ?
laser cannons disconnected
captain jimmy , sir !
gee , that wasn' t so tough .
doc !
doc , wake up !

fine work , jimbo .
fine work indeed .
thanks for showing us the way , boy .
aah !
what' s this sorry stack of metal ? !
not the face !
you' re just like me , jimbo .
ya hates to lose .

i' d get busy .
oh , the powers that be .
would you look ?
tie him up and leave him with the others till we what ?
you want the map ... you' re taking me , too .
hmm .
we' il take ' em all .
it' s ok , morph .
don' t worry .
jimmy , l i don' t know about you ... but i' m starting to see my life pass in front of my eyes .
at least , i think it' s my life .
was i ever dancing with an android named lupe ? !
b. e. n. , shh .
this isn' t over yet .
we' re gettin ' close . lads
i smell treasure a waitin ' .
i see nothing !
one great , big stinking hunk of nothing !
what' s going on , jimbo ?
i don' t know .
i can' t get it open .
we should' ve never followed this boy !
hey !
i' d suggest you get that gizmo going again . and fast !
let' s rip his gizzard right out right now !
throw him off the cliff !
oh , have mercy .
the lagoon nebula ?
but that' s halfway across the galaxy .
a big door opening and closing
let' s see .
kinapis .
montressor spaceport .
so that' s how flint did it .
he used this portal to roam the universe stealing treasure .
but where' d he stash it all ?
where' s that blasted treasure ? !
treasure !
treasure !
it' s buried in the
buried in the centroid of the mechanism .
what if the whole planet is the mechanism ... and the treasure is buried in the center of this planet ?
and how in blue blazes are we supposed to get there ?
just open the right door .
wait for me !
wait for me !
the loot of a thousand worlds .
we are going to need a bigger boat !
this is all seeming very familiar .
i can' t remember why
b. e. n. , come on .
we' re getting out of here , and we' re not leaving empty handed .
but but , jimmy !
jimmy !
a lifetime of searching .
and at long last ...
i can touch it .
do you know what' s strange ?
i can' t tell you how frustrating this is , jimmy ...
' cause there' s something just it' s nagging at the back of my mind .
aah !
captain flint ?
ln the flesh !
well , s sort of , except for skin , organs ... or anything that that that resembles flesh ... that' s not there .
and yet it' s so odd . you know ?
i remember there was something horrible
flint didn' t want anyone else to know but h h just can' t remember what it was
oh , a mind is a terrible thing to lose !
b. e. n. , i think i just found your mind .
hold still .
aah !
jimmy , your hands are very , very cold .
whoa !
hello .
you know , uh , jimmy , i was just thinking ...
i was just think
it' s all flooding back !
all my memories !
right up until flint pulled my memory circuits ... so i could never tell anybody about his booby trap !
speaking of which ...
huh ?
flint wanted to make sure ... that nobody could ever steal his treasure ... so he rigged this whole planet ... to blow higher than a kalepsian kite !
run , jimmy !
run for your life !
you go back and help the captain and doc !
lf i' m not there in 5 minutes , leave without me .
i am not leaving my buddy jimmy .
unless he looks at me like that .
bye , jim !
no !
no !
oh , no !
oh , no !
no !
aah !
aah !

all my life , i dreamed of an adventure like this .
i' m just sorry ...
i couldn' t have been more helpful to you .
oh , don' t be daft .
you' ve been very helpful .
truly .
i feel like such a useless weakling ... with abnormally thin wrists .
excuse me , brutish pirate .
yes , you .
i have a question .
ls it that your body is too massive ... for your teeny tiny head ... or is it that your head is too teeny tiny ... for your big , fat body ?
i pummel you good !
yes , i' m sure you will , but before you do ...
i have one more question .
ls this yours ?
uhh ...
yes !
morph , we are so out of here !
ah .
jimbo !
aren' t you the seventh wonder of the universe ?
get back !
i like you , lad , but i' ve come too far ... to let you stand between me and me treasure .
aah !
oh , no , you don' t !
what ?
jimbo .
reach for me now !
reach !
l i can' t !
i ...
oh , blast me for a fool !
aah !
silver , you gave up ?
just a lifelong obsession , jim .
i' il get over it .
aloha .
jimmy !
hurry , people !
we got exactly two minutes ... and thirty four seconds till planet' s destruction !
you' re doing fine , doctor .
now ease her over gently gently !
aah !
we were better off on exploding planet !
take us out of here , metal man !
aye , captain !
captain , you dropped from the heavens in the nick of
save your claptrap for the judge , silver !
missile tail demobilized , captain !
thrusters at only 30 % of capacity .
30 % ?
that means we' re
we' il never clear the planet' s explosion in time .
we gotta turn around .
what ?
there' s a portal back there .
it can get us out of here !
pardon me .
jim . but didn' t that potal open onto a raging inferno ? !
yes , but i' m gonna change that .
i' m gonna open a different door
captain , really , i don' t see how this is possible
listen to the boy !
one minute , twenty nine seconds till planet' s destruction !
what do you need , jim ?
just some way to attach this .
all right .
stand back .
stand back , now .
there you go .
ok .
now , no matter what happens ... keep the ship heading straight for that portal .
fifty eight seconds !

seventeen seconds !
seven six five four three ... two ...
wow !
yeah !
you done it .
jimmy !
you done it , boy !
ha ha ha !
didn' t i say the lad had greatness in him ?
unorthodox , but ludicrously effective .
i' d be proud to recommend you to the interstellar academy they could use a man like you
just wait until your mother hears about this !
of course , we may downplay the life threatening parts .
jimmy , that was unforgettable !
i know you don' t like touching ... but get ready for a hug , big guy , ' cause i gotta hug ya !
ha ha ha ha !
hey , you hugged me back .
oh , i promised myself i wouldn' t cry .
does anyone have a tissue ?
morphy , we gotta make tracks .
i know .
you never quit . do you ?
ah , jimbo !
ha ha !
i was merely checking to make sure ... our last longboat was safe and secure .
mmm .
well ... that should hold it .
heh heh heh .
i taught you too well .
lf you don' t mind , we' d just as soon avoid prison .
little morphy here , he' s a free spirit .
being in a cage , it' d break his heart .
ohh !
what say you ship out with us , lad ?
you and me , hawkins and silver ... full of ourselves and no ties to anyone !
you know , when i got on this boat ...
i would' ve taken you up on that offer in a second ... but , uh , i met this old cyborg ... and he taught me that i could chart my own course .
that' s what i' m gonna do .
and what do you see of that pal of yours ?
a future .
why ...
look at ya , glowing like a solar fire .
you' re something special , jim .
you' re gonna rattle the stars , you are .
got a bit of grease in this cyborg eye of mine .
oh , hey , morph .
i' il see ya around , ok ?
see ya around .
morphy , i got a job for ya .
i need you to keep an eye on this here pup .
will ya do me that little favor ?
aye aye , captain .
oh , and one more thing .
this is for your dear mother ... to rebuild that inn of hers .
stay out of trouble , ya old scalawag .
why , jimbo , lad ... when have i ever done otherwise ?
it' s good to see the sun and feel this place
this place i never thought would feel like home
and i ran forever
far away
and i always thought i' d end up here alone
somehow the world has changed
and i' ve come home
to give you back the things they took from you
and i feel you now
i' m not alone
i always know where you are
when i see myself
i always know where you are
where you are
and i found something that was always there
sometimes it' s got to hurt before you feel
but now i' m strong . and i won' t kneel
except to thank who' s watching over me
and somehow i feel so strong
and i' ve begun to be the one
i never thought i' d be
and i feel you now
i' m not alone h always know where you are
and when i see myself
i always know where you are
where you are
now it' s all so clear
and i believe
that everything' s been opened up to me
and i feel you now
i' m not alone
i always know
i always know where you are
and when i see myself
i always know where you are
and when i feel the sun
i always know where you are
and when i see myself
i always know where you are
where you are
