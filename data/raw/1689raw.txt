i always thought juno would eat her young .
oh , nice .
i' m well able to handle myself , thanks very much .
i' ve heard about you .
you' re that mentalist that jumps off buildings .
base jumping .
you should try it , seriously .
so you live in america now ?
ran out of things to jump off in galway , you know .
i' m always searching for the next big high .

anyway ... cheers .
here' s to our adventure .
skol .
cheers .
come on , light , you bastard .
so , have you done boreham caverns before ?
i saw it in a book once .
it' s for tourists .
it' s not adventure .
might as well have hand rails and a fucking gift shop .
lf you' re a caver , jumper , climber ... .. you just do it and not give a shite .
or the thing that' s bigger than you will get you .
you want adventure , holly ?
when have i ever let you down ?
what ?
holly , tomorrow is going to be awesome .
ok ?
take this .
you need it .
what about josh , sam ?
are you guys still together ?
kind of .
sort of .
different ... shifts .
oh , my god .
oh , my jesus !
what do you think , eh ?
don' t say a fucking word , all right ?
it was a christmas present .
shut up .
what about you holly ?
got a man ?
oh ...
i' m a sports fuck like juno .
what ?
rebecca , too , i think .
but when i' m older , l want to have lots of babies .
beth , did sarah tell you that ...
oh !
wakey .
wakey .
i feel like road kill .
give me five minutes .
five minutes .
good morning , my little ones .
wakey , wakey .

it' s fucking freezing !
holly !
we' re leaving at seven .

the queen is dead .

sausage !
sarah , slow down a bit .
i' m having fun .
she' s having fun .
whoa !
turn , turn , turn there .
let' s off road .
great .
you should have some water .
trying to set this watch is impossible .
the buttons are too fucking small .
leave it alone .
why do you wear it , anyway ?
my boyfriend gave it to me , it' s sentimental .
it' s fucking mental .
any guy that gave that to me , i' d dump him .
juno , are you sure this is the right way ?
relax , i' ve never been lost in my life .
marvellous .
so have you done these caves before ?
no .
but they are only level two .
quite safe , don' t worry .
i wasn' t .
the only danger is that i might fall asleep .
boreham caves .
more like boredom caves .
nice parking .
thanks .
this one time in galway . when i free climbed the cathedral , a priest chased me down the whole of the ground floor .
that was brilliant .
i shouldn' t have wasted the effort , though .
holly , shut up .
rebecca , leave her alone .
ok , guys , let' s get moving .
we' re running late .
come on , keep up .
hey , holly , wait up .
move it , short arse .
oi , carter , get to the back .
come on , you lazy bastard .
you finally caught up with me .
juno , are we there yet ?
there' s a river about half a mile ahead .
when we reach it , we follow it up to the mouth of the cave , ok ?
how does she know there' s a river up ahead ?
i can' t hear a thing .
she can probably smell it .
she came up here last week to check the route out .
lt' s rule number one file a flight plan and stick to it .
and rule number two ?
don' t go wandering off .
you think it' s dark when you turn out the lights .
well , down there it' s pitch black .
you can get dehydration , disorientation ...
yeah , yeah , yeah . .. claustrophobia ...
blah , blah . .. panic attacks , paranoia , hallucinations , visual and aural deterioration ...
hey !
eurgh .
yeah , lovely , holly .
a real kodak moment .
don' t touch it .
you wouldn' t want to piss it off .
what do you think did that , sam ?
a bear ?
what is this ?
nature detectives ?
it could have been big foot .
come on .
sam , stop poking it with a fucking stick .
this is it .
you' re having a laugh !
afraid not .
i' m an english teacher , not fucking tomb raider .
you' il be fine .
ok , sarah , beth , you' re up next .
sam , stay with becca .
do what she does and you' il be fine .
holly , safety first .
i don' t want any stunts this time .
you ok ?
see you down there .
no .
make sure your cow' s tail is locked there and there .
you hold on to this like that .
look , i have done this before , you know ?
i' m only looking after you .
and i appreciate it , in small doses .
you gotta see this place .
it' s beautiful !
you won' t believe this , beth .
oh , shit !
shit , shit , shit .
oh , my god , i' m gonna die .
ah , piece of piss .
oh , my god !
lt' s incredible .
clear !
it' s holly .
shit , move !
holly , you do this safely , in order , following my lead .
ok ?
take it slow and easy .
juno .
smart arse .
it' s ok .
it' s ok .
it' s ok .
they' re gone .
they' re gone now .
look .
one bat , two bats .
50 bats .
holly , fuck off .
which way ?
there' s only one way out of this chamber and that' s down the pipe .
ok .
it' s a drop .
ok ?
holly , chuck us your bag .
oh , my god !
find anything good ?
jesus christ !
come on , let' s eat .
holly , would you take a break ?
i just want to take a few more shots .
this cave is a lot cooler than i thought .
hey ?
not hungry .
are you ok ?
juno , i won' t break .
i' m fine .
i asked you for this .
i know .
um , sarah ?
l haven' t had a chance to say that i' m ... really sorry i didn' t stay around longer after the accident .
anyway ... .. we' re all here for you now , ok ?
yeah .
look , sorry .
i' m feeling a bit out of it .
it' s probably jet lag .
so i' m just going to take a look around , ok ?
yeah , ok .
why don' t you try and find us the way through , huh ?
hey , don' t go too far .
what' s up with her ?
she looks like she' s seen a ghost .
she' s fine .
i' ve found the next passage !
that' s it ?
it' s a bit small , isn' t it ?
hey , hey , hey !
i don' t get this .
what ?
this is not how i imagined it from reading the book .
that' s why i don' t trust books .
leaves too much room for interpretation .
something wrong ?
no .
it' s nothing .
holly : l' m taking point , guys .
careful .
just find the way through .
we' il wait here .
sarah ?
shit .
are you still behind me ?
yes .
shit !
shit !
sarah ?
guys , it' s sarah , i think she might be stuck .
l am stuck !
all right , sarah .
calm down , just relax .
i can' t fucking relax .
fuck , fuck !
sarah , you have to calm down and the only way you' re going to do that is to breathe .
ok , breathe slowly .
just keep breathing .
i can' t .
i can' t .
i can' t fucking breathe .
sarah , ok , listen to me .
just listen to my voice , yeah ?
sarah , i' m coming .
i' m coming back .
ok ?
ok .
sarah , ok ?
listen to me , keep breathing .
ok ?
hey .
hey , hey .
ok .
ok .
ok .
look here at me , sarah , hey ?
help me .
what are you so worried about , sarah ?
look at me .
ok , breathe .
breathe , ok ?
hey , hey , hey .
listen to me .
listen to me .
what are you so afraid of ?
i can' t fucking move !
you can move .
sarah , look at me , look at me .
the worst thing that could have happened to you has already happened and you' re still here .
this is just a poxy cave and there' s nothing left to be afraid of , i promise .
ok ?
ok ?
hey .
hey , listen , listen .
listen to me , you' il love this one .
how do you give a lemon an orgasm ?
god damn it , let me hear you say it .
how do you give a lemon an orgasm ?
what do you do ?
you tickle its citrus .
ok , that' s better .
come on .
ok , ok .
all right , we' re going to move now .
take hold of my arm , all right ?
we' re going to move slowly .
that' s it , grab my arm , ok ?
ok , come on .
just slowly .
pull on me , ok ?
ok , come on .
the rope bag .
i forgot the rope bag .
ok .
ok , fuck the rope bag .
ok , move , now !
now !
hurry up !
sarah , come on !
sarah , keep hold of the rope !
sarah ?
oh , ah .
are you ok ?
i' m all right .
juno : ls everybody ok ? ls everybody ok ?
don' t fucking touch me .
rebecca ?
i' m here , i' m ok .
beth , are you injured ?
no , i' m fine .
nobody move until the dust has settled .
don' t worry , juno , we' re not going anywhere .
you might be right about that .
jesus .
so what' s the story now ?
according to the guidebook , this cave system has three ways out .
this is just one of them .
lsn' t that right , juno ?
juno , that' s right , isn' t it ?
check the book .
i didn' t bring it .
what ?
no point .
for christ' s sake , juno .
l knew it .
i knew this wasn' t right .
you filed a flight plan to mountain rescue ?
lf we don' t report in , they' il come looking for us .
that' s how it' s supposed to work except i put in a flight plan for boreham caverns and this isn' t boreham caverns , is it , juno ?
we' re in the wrong fucking cave ?
holly was right .
boreham caverns was a tourist trap .
don' t try and pin this fucking shite on me !
this is not caving .
this is an ego trip .
rebecca , i didn' t know this was going to happen .
this is exactly what we believe in .
we said , if there' s no risk , what' s the point ?
don' t try and justify this .
where ...
where are we ?
it hasn' t got a name .
it' s a new system .
i wanted us all to discover it .
no one' s ever been down here before .
you' re fucking kidding me .
oh , god !
how the hell do we get out ?
there may not be a way out .
look , there' s no going back now .
we have to find a way out of this chamber and keep pushing forward .
what the fuck do you think you' re doing ?
we all trusted you .
you told me this was going to be good for sarah .
have you any idea what she' s been through ?
no , cos you couldn' t get away fast enough , you selfish cow .
you know what , beth ?
we all lost something in that crash .
just get us out of here .
look , cave systems sometimes break ground .
it' s a small chance .
but if we stay here , we' il die .
let' s go .
wait !
what ?
don' t move , sam .
just don' t move .
stay right there .
oh , shit .
no more .
thanks , beth .
now i know how far down it is .
so , what now ?
one of us has to get all the way across there so they can rig a line for you guys .
i have three cams , i need at least three more .
where' s the other rope bag ?
where is it ?
we lost it , when the cave collapsed .
sorry .
help me .
come on , becca .
aargh !
you got it .
come on , come on .
come on , rebecca .
come on , rebecca .
what are you waiting for ?
fuck .
are you ok ?
what' s wrong ?
it' s nothing .
i' m all right .
ok .
all right , more slack .
more slack , thanks .
fuck !
fuck , fuck , fuck .
ok .
well done .
ok .
throw me the right rope .
ok .
ok .
come on .
yeah !
now , you make it look easy .
yeah , well , you make it look hard .
oh .
don' t look down , beth .
keep going .
just keep going .
you' re ok .
you' re safe .
good .
there you go .
was this about me or you ?
it' s about us , getting back to what we used to be .
i wanted us to claim this place , name it .
i thought maybe your name .
or maybe yours .
you' re doing well .
come on .
come on .
there you are .
come on , give me your hand .
juno ?
we' il need everything we' ve got .
haul it in .
fuck .
yes !
reach .
reach out .
aargh !
juno !
no !
juno , it' s ok , we' ve got you .
ok , pull !
sam !
holly , let me pass .
rebecca , show me your hand .
let go , let go .
what does it mean ?
it means we' re not the first .
it' s a piton , right ?
lf cavers were here , there' s a better chance of us getting out .
this equipment is at least 1 00 years old .
no one uses stuff like this any more .
besides , if anyone had been down here and made it out , they would have named it already .
becca , are you ok ?
i' il live .
holly , how does it look ?
lt' s tight again , but i can get through .
ok , keep going .
we' il be right behind you .
hey , there' s something down here .
guys , it' s amazing , but the batteries on our lights will run out .
so i suggest we keep moving .
wait a minute .
wait .
what is it , beth ?
juno , light up one of your flares .
we don' t have time for this .
just light a flare .
really lovely , beth , but it' s fucking useless .
no , look at it .
what do you see ?
you' ve got the mountain , the cave ... and there' s two entrances .
you are a fucking genius .
i have my moments .
this means there' s another way out ?
let' s find out .
come on !
bastard !
which way ?
holly , give me your lighter .
come on .
here .
fuck !
come on !
come on !
shit !
that one !
hey !
holly !
holly , slow down !
holly !
careful !
daylight !
i can see daylight !
holly !
careful !
slow down !
holly , it' s not daylight !
help me !
hold on !
guys !
hold ...
holly !
sam !
get down here !
holly !
holly !
holly !
answer me !
i think i hurt my leg !
don' t move !
we' re coming down to you .
oh , fuck !
no !
fuck !
someone better get down here !
oh , that' s fucking disgusting .
beth !
not here , not now !
we need help .
everybody grab a corner .
we need to move her out of the water .
nice and easy now .
and ... lift !
argh !
you fuckers !
juno , find something to make a splint out of .
it' s ok , i' ve got her .
hey , juno , use one of the ice axes .
you' il be all right , sweetheart .
ok .
sarah !
juno , i' m gonna need your help here .
sarah !
juno !
take hold of her arm .
you' il have to hold her down .
what are you gonna do ?
i need to dress the wound and rig up a splint , but i can' t while the bone is protruding .
i need to push it back in .
i hate you .
i know .
do it .
bite down on this .
keep hold of her .
just fucking bite down , ok ?
go !
come on !
just keep biting down , baby .
come on .
ok , someone get me a medical kit .
ok , ok , ok .
calm down .
it' il be all right .
what are you doing ?
i just saw something ahead in the tunnel .
sarah , i promise you , i' m gonna get you out of here .
but i can' t do it unless you' re with me .
sarah ?
sarah !
sarah , look at me .
there' s nothing there .
that' s the best i can do .
it' il hurt like hell and you can' t put any weight on it , but at least you can move .
they combed these mountains centuries ago .
anyone trapped would be a skeleton now .
that is just what it looked like .
what ?
sarah thinks she saw someone .
saw what ?
i don' t think i saw someone , i saw someone .
no , you heard something and saw what you wanted to see .
it' s the dark .
it plays tricks on people .
i can describe exactly what i saw .
what did you see ?
a man .
i saw a man .
are you sure ?
yes !
and it' s not the first time .
i thought i saw someone before , but now i' m sure .
look , if there is somebody down here , then maybe they can help get us out .
sarah , there' s no one down here .
forget about it !
hey , we have to get holly out of here .
ok ?
this is all that matters right now .
beth !
it' s ok .
ls it ?
fuck !
fuck me .
you' ve got to keep warm .
why are we walking away ?
there was daylight back there .
it wasn' t .
it was phosphorus in the rock .
we' re two miles underground , the only light down here is ours .
argh !
well , it looked like fucking daylight to me .
right tunnel !
i got you .
ok ?
jesus !
what is this place ?
holly , where' s the infrared button ?
dead animals .
hundreds of them .
this is not good , guys .
can we get out of here ?
which way ?
come on .
i don' t know .
what do you mean , you don' t know ?
there' s no breeze .
it could be any one of these tunnels .
take your pick .
oh , fuck it !
hello !
please !
ls there anybody there ?
hello !
it' s there !
it' s up there !
it' s there on the roof !
fucking hell , did you see ... ?
what the fuck was that ?
i don' t know !
it moved so fast , i could barely see it !
i' ve never seen anyone climb like that !
i told you i saw someone !
that was not a human being !
screw this .
let' s take our chances and pick a tunnel .
move !
what' s happening ?
oh , shit !
it' s circling us .
where is it ?
this way !
move !
holly !
we' ve got to move .
we' ve got to move .
come on !
move it !
come on , holly !
move it !
let' s go !
juno , the flare !
get rid of it !
fuck !
holly , keep moving , come on !

sarah !
run !
sarah !

don' t leave me .
oh , fuck .

mummy .
mummy .
lf you' re really ready ...
oh , fuck .

becca !
becca !
it' s juno .
becca !

as long as it' s not on mine .
becca !

i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
oh ...

sam , run !
we heard you crying for sarah .
where are the others ?
they ...
they took holly .
beth ...
beth' s dead .
sam ... .. what is that thing ?
i don' t know .
well , it does look human .
come on , we need to find the way out before those things find us .
no .
sam , tell us what we' re fighting .
well ... .. they' re totally blind .
and judging from what we' ve seen , i' d say they use sound to hunt with .
like a bat .
and they' ve evolved perfectly to live down here in the dark .
whatever they are , they go to the surface to hunt .
and they bring their food back down here to eat , through an entrance .
listen , if we can stay quiet enough and evade these fuckers ... .. l think i found the way out .
you think ?
the climbing gear we found whoever brought that down here marked their route .
i found those markings .
well , what are we waiting for ?
sarah .
i' m not leaving without sarah .
sarah !
oh , god .
oh , god .
oh , god .
no .
sarah ...
i' m getting you out of here .
don' t touch me .
don' t touch me .
i heard juno calling me .
i' m gonna go and find her , and we' re gonna come back and get you out .
no , stay away from her .
what ?
she did this to me .
what ?
she left me .
no , she didn' t .
no .
shh .
sarah ...
don' t trust her .
you find your own way out .
it' s ok .
it' s all right .
i' m not gonna leave you , beth .
i' m not gonna leave you .
i' m not leaving you here , ok ?
come here .
beth !
this is juno' s .
