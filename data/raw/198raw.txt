... the minnesota pee wee championship is up for grabs .
both teams playing like there' s no tomorrow .
duluth , in the hawks' zone ,
looking for a chance to win it .
only a few seconds remain .
there' s a pass out to the blue line .
intercepted by gordon bombay !
bombay !
he' s got a breakaway .
across the blue line all alone for a chance to win the game !
he' s pulled down from behind by fox of duluth .
fox definitely pulled him down from behind and this could be
yes , the referee calls for a penalty shot .
gordon , it' s up to you .
i don' t wanna see any goats around after the game .
you got it ?
now , you miss this shot ... you' re not just lettin ' me down , you' re lettin ' your team down .
apressure situation he' s in now .
the 1973 pee wee state championship now rests ... on the little shoulders of number 9 , gordon bombay .
gordon !
gordon !
let' s go , son !
all right !
he hit the goalpost !
what a heartbreaker !
little gordon bombay had the chance
all my client did was attempt to give you what you wanted !
isn' t that right ?
this man put his neck on the line for your greed .
objection .
your honour ?
will both counsellors approach the bench ?
what' s he doing ?
i don' t have anything to tell you .
i just wanna make a point .
so nod like i' m saying something important .
mr. bombay ?
gordon , what are you doing ?
get out there and be my lawyer .
perfect .
this drives him nuts and i love it .
nice tie , frank .
you wore that yesterday , didn' t ya ?
oh , mr. bombay , i' m so glad you could make it .
please restrict yourself to a relevant cross examination !
your honour , the applicability of societal intent ... vis a vis individual action is well established .
i' m citing minneapolis v. higgins .
the appellant court overruled a judge who disallowed similar testimony .
now , if i' m not mistaken , that was ... you .
wasn' t it, judge weathers ?
i stand corrected , counsellor .
objection overruled .
oh, you really stooped to an all time low on this , bombay .
i' m insulted , frank .
you have no idea how low i can stoop .
i don' t mind losing .
i would just like to lose fair .
losing fair is still losing , frank .
gotta go for the " w " every time .
and what about justice ?
that man should be in jail .
it was your job to put him there .
don' t take it out on me !
next time do your job , frankie boy .
30 and 0 !
i remain undefeated .
what about the frazier case ?
we don' t count that one because i scored with the court reporter .
the one you said had the intelligent body ?
that' s the one .
no calls on the duck phone ?
not yet .
what' s he waiting for ?
i saw him in the back of the courtroom .
how about some kudos here , huh ?
mr. tolbert dropped off ringside seats for tonight' s north stars game .
hockey ?
forget it !
gordon , here' s the research for the pearlstein project .
can you get started ?
jane !
can' t you see i' m reveling here ?
today i' m 30 and 0 !
30 and one .
type, jeannie , don' t speak .
mr. bombay' s office .
yes .
it' s ducksworth .
you' re right .
he wants to see you .
ha ha ha !
thank you very much , mr. ducksworth !
it was nothing , mr. ducksworth .
quack , quack , quack , mr. ducksworth .
gordon , another fine job today .
thank you , sir .
just one thing .
score .
don' t spike .
i' m not sure i understand what you mean , sir .
this is a business .
it isn' t a game .
next time a little restraint might be in order .
hey , man , get off my back i' m doin' the best i can, yeah   you bust my neck cut no slack
forget your fellow man yeah yeah uh huh
pull your vehicle over to the right , now !
this is not good .
hey , man , whoa yeah yeah  licence , please .
could you turn down the stereo ?
sure .
i guess it was a " widdle " noisy .
a " widdle " ?
okay , i' m taking you down to precinct .
breath , blood or urine ?
no , thanks , i' m full .
okay , out of the car .
now .
the charges against mr. bombay are driving under the influence , driving with an open container and reckless endangerment .
and to think i almost stayed home this morning .
i assume you' re representing yourself ?
twelve moving violations in three years ?
how do you still have a licence ?
okay , let' s talk business .
what am i facing ?
suspension of licence ?
fines ?
what ?
yes , unless the d. a. ' s office will allow you to plead guilty to lesser charges .
but that' s solely up to the prosecutor .
the city of minneapolis does not wish to pursue a plea bargain in this case .
hmm .
gotta go for the " w , " right , gordo ?
the defendant is released on his own recognizance .
mr. ducksworth .
what are you doing here ?
i own the place .
how about you ?
just goin ' over a few cases .
rlcoh statute stuff .
oh , i thought you might be researching your defence ... against d. u. i. and reckless endangerment .
did you think i wouldn' t find out , gordon ?
there was no reason to concern you with it , sir .
they have no case .
frank huddy just wants my scalp .
i found a loophole .
i' m gonna plead not guilty
gordon , stop it .
there' s not going to be a loophole .
there' s not going to be a trial .
i am not going to have you drag ... this firm' s good name through the mud .
i' ve talked tojudge weathers and he has agreed to suspend your case .
under what conditions ?
probation , suspension of your driver' s licence ... and 500 hours of community service .
and a leave of absence from the firm .
a leave of absence ?
he can' t do that .
he can' t stop me from working !
he' s not .
i am .
that was my condition .
gordon , you need a break .
you' re too wrapped up in your work .
but , sir , my work is my life .
that' s just my point .
the community service will do you good .
it' il teach you compassion , a sense of fair play , how to fit in .
community service ?
this is horrible .
you' il get used to it .
and hopefully you' il come back a better person and a better attorney , which is why i' m keeping you on salary and have arranged a driver for you .
you know , in the early ' 7 os i drove the tour bus for the grand funk railroad .
man , that was the life .
chicks , parties , amps cranked up to about eight jillion decibels .
all that loud music damaged my hearing , but i got no regrets ...
except for the ' 80s .
how could he do this to me ?
community service ... coaching hockey !
i found one !
i' m comin ' out !
karp, you finally found something for once in your life .
dumpster dave comes through !
what do you think ?
lovely , karp , it goes with your eyes .
you gonna take that from him , karp ?
remind me to bust you , averman .
thanks , peter .
thanks very much .
did you get it ?
yeah !
right there !
yeah !

here , boy .
a little chili to keep you warm , buddy .
oh , yeah , that' s nice .
oh , yeah , look !
i can' t believe he ate the can too .
he sniffs .
he sniffs again .
looking for that perfect place .
he sniffs some more .
he stops .
i think this is it !
he' s turnin ' in a circle .
he squats !
he scores !
yes !
we did it !
full load .
stinks !
come on , come on , give me the dollar !
hurry it up already .
i' m hurryin ' , okay ?
go , go , go , go !
yeah !
all right !
let' s do it !
oh , come on .
stop !
yes !
okay !
here we go .
yeah .
there' s more inside .
he' s takin' off with it .
this guy deserves what he gets .
oh , guys , he saw us .
oh , my !
rink' s gotta be around here someplace .
just look for a sign that says " personal hell .
how could he do this to me ?
i hate kids .
they' re barely human .
come on !
over here !
keep it down , please !
hey , come on .
there' s no need for this .
let' s talk , come on .
i' m your friend , aren' t i ?
come on , goldberg , at least try to stop it .
i' m tired of chasin ' the puck .
be careful , man .
it almost hit me that time .
goldberg , you' re the goalie .
it' s supposed to hit you .
does that sound stupid to anyone else ?
good god .
that' s the hockey team .

it' il be all right .
i ain' t scared .
you don' t know what you' re doin ' .
shut your face , karp .

this is my dominion .
this is a drug free zone , you understand ?
we ain' t buyin ' nothin ' .
i' m feelin ' generous today .
so i' m gonna let you get your sorry vanilla bootie outta here ... before we be usin ' your eyeballs as hockey pucks .

to see my kids takin ' falls ?
gordon .
how did you know ?
through the back door at this time of night .
just like you used to .
you' d spend hours watching me do this .
what do you think ?
is this sharp enough ?
ow !
did you cut yourself ?
no .
you always fell for that .
god , you' re morbid , hans .
no , i' m scandinavian .
it' s nice to see you .
sure , sure , sure .
you probably thought i was dead .
i saw you at the game the other night .
why didn' t you say anything ?
you were so busy screaming at the kids .
i didn' t want to spoil the moment .
everything' s the same .
well , the game hasn' t changed .
why should my store ?
heard you became a doctor .
lawyer .
oh , that' s too bad .
enjoy that ?
well , i hardly ever lose a case .
that is not what i asked .
hmm !
i see you still have this up .
thanks very much .
it is important to remember the past .
i' d just as soon forget it .
that was the worse time in my life .
my dad died that year .
the two are not related .
no , but it felt like they were .
i found this not long ago .
he was proud of you .
i miss him .
you scored 198 goals in that season , gordon .
it' s a shame you quit .
you
could have gone all the way .
yeah .
no !
you really loved to play .
you remember ?
you remember ... you used to play on the ponds until after dark , until your father called you back .
you really flew on that ice , gordon .
that' s all i ever wanted to do .
then why did you stop ?
reilly ?
i saw what he did to you .
reilly is an idiot .
the guy wins .
it' s not about winning .
it never was .
just show they how to play .
show them how to have fun .
teach them to fly .
that is what they' il remember long after you' ve gone back to being a doctor .
lawyer .
and long after they' ve stopped buying skates from me .
here ... there you are .
sharpened , laced , ready to go .
what' s this ?
your new skates .
that is why you came here tonight , isn' t it ?
i figured nine and a half was your size .
actually , i' m a nine .
wear thick socks , gordon .
enjoy them .
here comes bombay on an end to end rush .
past the blue line , past centre .
he' s not skating , he' s flying !
he fakes once , he fakes twice .
fakes three times !
shoots !
scores !
yes !
yes !
yes !
yes !
what a play !
what a guy !
gordon bombay does it again !
great move , gordy !
you faked him out of his pads .
come here , son .
you look great out there .
come on , let' s go inside , get something to eat .
a few more minutes ?
please ?
go on .
get outta here .
thanks .
hi , uh  please, just go away .
charlie doesn' t want ... to be on the team any more , and neither he nor i have anything to say to you .
well , i have something to say to you .
oh , really ?
door to door mistreatment now .
now the team can feel miserable between games too , huh ?
i came to apologize to charlie ... to both of you .
what ?
apologize .
well ... you should .
charlie .
somebody' s here to see you .
hey , charlie , how ya doin ' ?
i was just , uh , walkin ' around thinkin ' and , uh
wanna give us a minute ?
thank you .
you' re welcome .
listen , it was very wrong of me ... to ask you and the other guys to cheat .
i never should have said to you what i said to you .
i was angry .
i was frustrated .
it took a lot of guts for you to do what you knew was right .
i admire that .
and , uh , i just wanted to tell you that , uh , that i' m
oh , boy , this is difficult .
i' m  you' re sorry .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
all right ?
tell your mom that hopefully it' il be a lot more fun this time around .
what do you say ?
do you want to stay for dinner ?
what ?
charlie !
uh , no , i i can' t .
uh
well , what are you havin ' ?
mr. ducksworth , there are two reasons i came by .
first off , i want to let you know things are going well .
i' m learning a lot about teamwork , fair play and all that junk .
good , good .
and the second thing ?
well , sir , fair play doesn' t come cheap .
these kids , my team , have no money .
they can' t afford rink time , safe equipment , proper uniforms , which makes it difficult for them to compete .
now imagine , sir , being ten years old and stepping out onto that ice ... with old copies of the " enquirer " taped to your shins instead of pads .
the point i' m trying to make , sir , is that you wouldn' t be taken seriously and neither are these kids .
so i thought maybe the firm could help ' em out .
how much are we talking about ? $15, 000 .
no way .
wait a minute .
think of the goodwill .
we name the team after the firm .
suddenly , we' re the good guys .
ducksworth , saver and gross , the firm that gives back to the community .
come on .
i' il get you your own jersey .
ooo, yeah   can you feel it baby ooo  i can too , ooo   ooo   ooo , come on swing   come on swing   come on swing   c come on swing ooo   ooo  it' s such a good vibration  it' s such a sweet sensation  it' s such a good vibration  it' s such a sweet sensation
who is that kid ?
thanks , fulton .
fulton reed .
he' s in one of my classes .
how come he' s not on the team ?
he only plays football .
some preppie school gave him a scholarship ... as long as he doesn' t play hockey .
they don' t want him gettin ' hurt .
i heard it was colleges .
he' s been accepted to four of' em .
yeah , but i heard he' s got to repeat the sixth grade .
ah , shut up .
gordon bombay ?
bombay was a hawk .  ...
good vibration  it' s such a sweet sensation  feel the vibration it' s such a good vibration

the ducks ?
we' re the ducks ?
man , what brain dead jerk came up with that name ?
as a matter of fact , i did .
but i didn' t have a choice .
we' re being sponsored .
by who ?
donald and daisy ?
hey , you don' t wanna be ducks ?
you' d rather be district five ?
some stupid number ?
better than some stupid animal .
i' il have you know , peter , that the duck is one of the most noble , agile and intelligent creatures of the animal kingdom .
but they' re wimpy .
they don' t even have teeth .
neither do hockey players .
have you guys ever seen a flock of ducks flying in perfect formation ?
it' s beautiful .
pretty awesome the way they all stick together .
ducks never say die .
ever seen a duck fight ?
no way .
why ?
because the other animals are afraid .
they know that if they mess with one duck , they gotta deal with the whole flock .
oh , man !
i' m proud to be a duck .
and i' d be proud to fly with any one of you .
so how about it ?
who' s a duck ?
i' il be a duck .
yeah .
me too .
anybody see goldberg ?
all right !
now we' re the ducks !
the mighty ducks !
what are we ?
the ducks !
what the hell are they doing ?
every time you get the puck , you' re the quarterback .
make eye contact with the receiver .
talk to him , let him know it' s comin ' .
come on , guys .
this isn' t a library .
talk to each other .
what a weird ass team .
how you doin ' ?
you ready ?
i think so .
okay , fulton .
shoot your heart out .
my god !
wow !
one out of five .
all right , let' s forget the past .
we lost a few games , tough !
that was district five .
now we' re the ducks .
yeah .
and the ducks ... are undefeated .
all right !
yeah !
quack , quack .
quack .
quack .
quack !
quack !

let' s get you off the ice .
come on .

okay , ducks , we still got a chance here .
connie , terry, jesse , guy , time for the secret weapon .

remember, just like we talked about .
come on , guys .
let' s do it .
oh , no .
go !
get the face off !
line up , boys , let' s go .
that' s it .
aaah !
whoa !
whoo !
yeah !
that tie of yours might be what you need to make the play offs .
the ducks have a shot at the play offs ?
sure .
everyone but the last two teams are in , remember ?
panthers got the measles and they forfeited the season .
so, you beat the huskies and you' il make the play offs .
well , we might have to play the hawks .
so ?
so they' re a tough team .
nothing' s changed since i played .
actually , one little thing has changed .
you wouldn' t even be a hawk now .
they redrew the district lines last year .
the lake is not the boundary any more .
you see ?
you' d be a duck .
i' d be a duck .
excuse me .
coach reilly ?
yeah ?
i' m afraid there' s a bit of a problem .
what' s that ?
one of your players is ineligible .
banks !
over here !
this is a joke , right ?
i' m afraid it' s no joke .
problem ?
no, just a mistake .
are you this boy' s father ?
450 north hennipen , is that your address ?
yes .
i' m afraid there' s no mistake .
this boy is playing for the wrong team .
what ?
according to league rules , adam banks should be playing for district five .
my son is a hawk , not a duck .
is this your doing , gordon ?
i' il expect to see him at our next game .
we' il have a uniform waiting for you .
no way .
my son would rather not play than play for your team .
fine , if that' s the way you want it .
but remember , if adam plays for the hawks , you' il forfeit every game for the rest of the season .
boy , i' d hate to see that .
look , i' m sorry this had to happen , but you can see on the map .
gordon ?
hey , bombay !
you stop when i' m talking to you , son !
what' s the idea here ?
you trying to sabotage me or what ?
the law' s a bitch when it works against you , isn' t it, jack ?
you got a whole team of banks' s .
one kid isn' t gonna make a difference .
even with banks , what do you think you' re gonna prove , you and that bunch of losers ?
that' s right , coach .
they are losers .
we hate losers , don' t we ?
they don' t even deserve to live .
maybe banks won' t make a difference , but at least we' re playing by the rules .
why' d you turn against me , gordon ?
for six years ...
i taught ya how to skate , i taught ya how to score .
i taught ya how to go for the " w.
you could have been one of the greats .
and now look at yourself .
you' re not even a has been .
you' re a never was .
going to the play offs !
whoo !
one win !
hey , why aren' t you guys in uniform ?
we got warm ups in half an hour .
all right , everyone , listen up .
i got some good news .
we' re getting a new player , adam banks .
what ?
he' s a hawk .
he' s a good player .
yuck .
everybody hates him .
we don' t need him .
i' m the coach .
i say we do need him .
if we make it to the play offs , he could be a big help .
if ?
all of a sudden you don' t think we' re good enough .
no , he thinks we' re losers .
that' s what he told reilly .
what ?
we heard what you said .
you said we were losers , we didn' t deserve to live .
that' s not what i meant .
i saw that picture of you missing that goal .
you were a hawk , weren' t you ?
guess you guys stick together to the end .
you know what ?
i don' t need your stinkin' equipment .
see you around .
peter , come back here .
i' m talkin ' to you , son !
forget it , cake eater .
if you wanna play , play with yourself .
come on , terry .
where do you guys think you' re goin ' ?
i don' t believe this .
all right , i' m goin ' up to the bench because that' s where i' m supposed to be .
anyone who wants to join me can join me .
anyone who doesn' t
well
ten minutes to game time , coach .
yeah , yeah , they' il be out in a minute .
they' re , you know , working themselves into a frenzy .
not much of a frenzy .
we forfeit .
ducks forfeit .
flames , you win .
hey .
can i sit ?
sure .
you talk to the guys ?
i tried .
they think i' m a traitor for even showing up .
i guess they really hate me , huh ?
is it true you were really a hawk ?
yeah .
peter said you blew a really big game once .
yeah , well , peter' s right .
it was the last game of the state finals .
we were tied 2 2 in the end of the third period .
i get a penalty shot .
i go in , i triple deke .
i fake the goalie right out of his pads .
the puck' s headed in , and then ...
clang !
hits the post .
we lost in overtime .
a quarter of an inch this way and it would have gone in .
a quarter of an inch , charlie .
yeah , but a quarter inch the other way and you' d have missed completely .
i never thought of it that way .
at least you got to play in a championship game .
that must' ve been so cool .
hey .
can i get you a cup of coffee ?
i' d love one .
you know , she has many fine qualities that men find attractive .
i know that , charlie .
that fact hasn' t escaped me .
so , what kind of guys does she usually date ?
jerks .
i mean , most of them like her , but as soon as they catch a glimpse of me
pow !
warp speed !
they are gone !
don' t take it personally , charlie .
oh , i wouldn' t even care ... except it' s not fair to my mom .
she deserves somebody nice .
are you gonna come over for dinner again ?
i don' t know , charlie .
i' m not sure it' s such a good idea .
see , that' s what i wanted to talk to you about .
i , um , talked tojesse and terry' s dad , and he' s gonna take over coaching for the rest of the year .
you' re quitting ?
i' m stepping aside to keep the team together .
the guys can' t play for somebody they don' t trust .
i trust you .
the other guys do too .
they just don' t know it .
talk to ' em .
i' ve done all i can .
no , you haven' t .
you gotta make ' em understand .
you can' t walk out on the ducks .
we' re your team .
no , you' re not .
we are too !
we weren' t even the ducks until you came along .
you made us and now you' re stuck with us .
charlie .
that' s right .
the red is oxygen .
now what are the blue balls ?
tommy ?
hydrogen ?
is correct .
now put them together ... and you have a molecule that makes up 96 % of your body .
what is it ?
pizza ?
it' s the principal .
i' il be right back .
work on h2 co3 .
it' s a goody .
how' d the forfeit go , spaz way ?
yeah , did you score ?
leave me alone , guys .
i don' t want to talk about the team .
oh , yeah , sure .
coach' s pet .
everybody knows he likes you best .
likes his mom , you mean .
take it back , karp !
take it back now !
leave him alone .
you have no right shoving karp .
don' t push me .
don' t push her , she' s a girl !
lay off !
don' t shove , peter .
atoms away !
my atoms !
you !
sit !
sit now !
in your seats now !
i have never in my life
what have you got to say for yourselves ?
quack .
quack , quack , quack , quack , quack !
thanks for coming by on such short notice , gordon .
by the way , your court release came through .
congratulations .
your community service is over .
you' re kidding .
so you wanted to talk about my coming back to work then ?
well , actually  oh , you got your jersey .
great !
a lot' s been happening .
the ducks might even make the play offs .
gordon , you know coach reilly and mr. banks .
sir , they' re the bad guys .
no , actually , phil is one of my oldest friends .
gerald was kind enough to get us all together here to try to work out this little problem .
you see , my son adam wants to play for the hawks .
his older brother was a hawk .
all of his little friends are hawks .
that' s where he belongs .
it' s a tradition .
you understand that , gordon .
you played .
but the league' s already ruled on it .
we' ve talked to the league , and we worked out a little deal .
you guys cut a deal with the pee wee hockey league ?
yes , we did .
the long and short of it is that adam stays on the hawks for the rest of the season .
and then next year , they redraft the lines .
correctly .
the league did make one condition .
what' s that ?
that you withdraw your protest .
that' s great .
good , good .
well , that' s settled then .
no , sir , you don' t understand .
i can' t withdraw my protest .
what ?
mr. ducksworth , you wanted me to learn about fair play ... and how to be part of a team ... and i may not have learned everything yet , but i remember something my father said to me .
a team isn' t a bunch of kids out to win .
a team is something you belong to , something you feel , something you have to earn .
and i' m not gonna let those kids down .
gordon , i' m going to make this simple .
are you prepared to lose your job over some kids ?
some game ?
let me ask you , sir .
are you prepared to fire me over some kids ?
some game ?
collect your personal belongings , gordon .
yes , sir , mr. ducksworth !
thank you very much , mr. ducksworth !
quack , quack , quack , quack , quack , mr. ducksworth !
quack , quack , quack , quack , quack .
gordon , stop quacking .
you may have paid for this jersey , sir , but you didn' t earn it .
i' il see you in the play offs .
excuse me .
there are some students here that i' d like to see .
who are you ?
i' m their hockey coach .
if you could tell me where i can find each of them , please .
they' re in room 223 .
all of them ?
all of them .
i will not quack at the principal .
what do you want ?
i want to talk to you guys .
people .
people , right .
sit down , please .
all of you .
okay , don' t sit down .
look , what' s done is done .
i want to be your coach again .
you' re gonna coach a bunch of losers ?
no , i want to coach the ducks .
what about the things you said ?
you said we didn' t deserve to live .
karp , i was being sarcastic .
do you know what that means ?
no .
okay , then you do .
i didn' t mean those things the way they sounded .
you guys know what it' s like to be misunderstood , right ?
yeah , of course .
we' re kids .
so ...
can you forgive me ?
can i be your coach again ?
what about banks ?
he can be on the team if he wants .
he should have been with us all year .
it' s you guys who were cheated .
let' s forget all that crap !
we' re a team , right ?
yeah .
i made you guys , and i' m sticking with you .
so , what' s it gonna be ?
we can play tomorrow night and still have a shot at the play offs ... or we can forfeit again and the season' s over .
peter , what do you say ?
well ...
i guess it would help if we practised first .
all right .
let me see if i can get you out of detention .
yes .
take that .
you really quacked at the principal ?
yeah .
are we ducks , or what ?
yeah !
look at your mother .
let' s see how it is in ten minutes .
i' m gonna kill you !
hey .
wasn' t sure if you' d show up .
yeah , whatever .
i just want to play hockey .
good .
ducks , you all know adam banks .
on behalf of the ducks , i' d like to say welcome .
cake eater .
ooh , thejess man , dissin' the new guy !
thejess ster !
shut up , averman !
it' s just a joke .
puttin ' on a ducks jersey doesn' t mean you' re a real duck .
they' re a good group once you get to know ' em .
i bet .

yeah ?
no , take your shot .
you may only get one , so it' s gotta be good .

if you ever want a shot , i' il get you a tryout in the minor league clubs .
thanks .

hey , nice seein ' ya .

all right , let' s have some fun !  you' ve got to accentuate the positive  eliminate the negative  latch on to the affirmative  don' t mess with mister in between   you' ve got to spread joy up to the maximum  bring gloom down to that minimum  have faith or pandemonium   you' re liable to walk upon the sea   to illustrate my last remark   talking aboutjonah in a whale and noah in an ark   what did they do when everything looked so dark   then they say   you better accentuate the positive  eliminate that negative  latch on to the affirmative  don' t mess with mister in between
we better accentuate the positive  eliminate all the negative  latch on to the affirmative  don' t mess with mister in between  no , don' t mess with mister in between
hey !
hey ! don' t you mess with mister in between
you know , i heard the north stars wore the same underwear ... all through the play offs last year for luck .
so i' m doin ' the same thing .
hmm .
maybe i should' ve cooked .
you know , i' m thinkin ' maybe we can all go down to the winter festival tonight .
all three of us ?
sure .
i don' t think i should , ' cause i got a lot of homework .
you should go .
with my mom .
by yourselves .
mmm , smells great !
hello .
go for it .
hi .
i don' t know how they sculpt these .
hmm , i wonder .
i used to sculpt , but now i do mostly paintings .
how do you think they do the details ?
oh , little men .
tiny chisels , big mittens .
oh .
i' m nervous .
i' m rambling on and on here .
you probably think i' m weird .
no , i think you' re great .
when i was a little girl , i used to pretend that that was an ice castle .
and that was my room , that window right up there .
and last winter i gave charlie that one .
what about me ?
which window' s mine ?
i want to live there too .
what ?
what did i say ?
it' s just not that easy .
what' s not that easy ?
casey , i was just playin ' around .
look , i don' t know how you feel about me .
i don' t even know how i feel about you .
but i do know there' s a little kid back home ... who' s absolutely falling in love with his coach ... and if you can' t deal with that , if you' re just playing around , then you better let me know .
what are we talking ?
' til death do us part ?
i have to decide on the first date ?
stop it , gordon .
charlie' s gonna be there when we get back .
and tomorrow .
and ten years from now .
look , i can take it .
but if charlie gets too attached
every time this happens , it gets ... a little rougher on him .
just on him ?
i' m glad to be here with you .
me too .
the surprising ducks are still in this game ... against the hornets .
banks moving right in front , stops .
he shoots , he scores !
it' s getting rough out there between the ducks and the hornets .
here' s adam banks in the slot .
he stops , shoots .
he scores !
back it goes to averman .
he shoots !
score !
the ducks win it , 5 3 over the hornets .
and now it' s on to the semifinals ... where the ducks will face the cardinals .
what a game so far , ladies and gentlemen !
the ducks and the cardinals !
cardinals with it in their own zone , tryin' to clear it out .
pass to the blue line , intercepted by the ducks .
here' s their star , adam banks .
banks has great speed .
right down the middle !
goes around one man with a great move !
steps around another defender !
he scores !
come on !
come on, jesse !
ducks with it again .
here' s averman , now getting it over to banks .
germaine is right in the slot .
germaine with it !
he shoots , he scores !
germaine put it off the goaltender' s glove into the net !
and that does it !
the ducks have won !
can you believe it ?
4 2 , and the ducks now get set to face the hawks in the state finals .
all right , it' s up to you , gordon .
now, you miss this shot , you' re not just letting your team down , you' re letting me down too .
remember , it' s not worth playing
if you can' t win .
that' s right .
okay , son , let' s go .
let' s go , son !

oh , say does that star spangled  banner yet wave   o' er the land of the free  and the home of the brave
