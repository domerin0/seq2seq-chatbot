hey , hey .
hey , hey .
slim ?
yeah .
i can' t keep up with that guy .
it' il kill me .
all right .
jack !
yeah .
take mike' s place .
aw , slim .
just for a while .
mike , you take jack' s place .
you' re on there .
so how long you and lennie been together , george ?
a long time .
a real long time .
really ?
seems kinda funny , you two travelling around together .
what' s funny about it ?
well , a cuckoo like him and a smart guy like you .
well , i ain' t so smart or i wouldn' t be bucking barley for my 50 bucks a month .
i guess you' re right .
how' d you two meet up ?
well , i knew his aunt clara .
she took him when he was a boy .
she raised him up .
when she died , lennie just come along with me working .
uh huh .
i used to play jokes on him cos he' s too damn dumb to take care of himself .
he' d do any damn thing i told him .
put that on back in here .
one day , a bunch of guys standing around on the sacramento river ,
i turns to him and i says " jump in , lennie .
and he jumps .
couldn' t swim a stroke .
he damn near drowned before we could get to him .
he was so damn nice to me for pulling him out , he forgot i told him to jump in .
he' s a nice fella .
a guy don' t need no sense to be a nice fella .
yeah .
he gets in trouble all the time cos he' s so goddamn dumb .
like what happened up north in weed .
what' d he do in weed ?
he seen this girl , in a red dress , and the dumb bastard that he is , he just ...
he wants to touch everything he likes , so he reaches out to touch this red dress .
so the girl starts screaming , and that gets lennie all mixed up , so he holds on and he won' t let go , cos that' s the only thing he can think to do .
so what happened ?
well , she runs off across the field , screaming .
so me and lennie take off running .
pretty soon we hear a bunch of guys with dogs coming after us .
had to hide in the irrigation ditch until it was safe to get away .
he didn' t hurt the girl none ?
hell , no .
he just scared her .
well ... he ain' t mean .
i can tell a mean guy a mile off .
milton !
i ain' t payin ' you to stand around .
get back to work .
he just come over for a drink of water .
you get back to work .
you get these men moving .
they' re way behind .
you men get moving here .
let' s go .
goddamnit , stop that racket !
lennie .
i told you not to bring that pup in here .
i ain' t got no pup .
any of you boys seen my wife ?
she ain' t been here .
where the hell' s slim ?
went out to the barn .
carlson , do you think he' s gonna find slim in the barn with his wife ?
better not tangle with slim .
curley' s lookin ' for a fight .
i gotta see this .
come on .
no , i' il stay here .
thanks .
was curley' s wife in the barn ?
if she was , i didn' t see her .
george .
both the ends is the same .
why both the ends is the same ?
it' s just the way they make ' em .
you sure she didn' t come in the barn , like she come in here ?
no , she never .
give me a good whorehouse every time .
a guy can go in , get drunk , get it all out of his system all at once , and no messes .
george .
yeah ?
how long is it gonna be till we get the little place and live off the fat of the land ?
gotta get some money together first .
i know a little place where you can get cheap , but they ain' t giving it away .
tell about that place .
it' s ten acres .
it' s got a windmill .
got a little shack on it , and a chicken run .
got rabbits , george ?
i could easily build a few hutches and you could feed ' em alfalfa .
you' re damn right .
you' re goddamn right i could .
but , george , tell about the house .
well , we have a little house , and we have a room to ourself .
and we have a little , fat , iron stove , and in the winter we keep a fire going in it .
and rabbits , george .
and that ...
but i tend ' em .
how do i tend them rabbits ?
well , you go out to the alfalfa field .
you have a sack .
you fill up that sack and you bring it in and you put it in the rabbit cage .
you have a few pigeons that fly around the windmill ,
like they done when i was a kid .
and it' d be our home .
nobody could can us .
we don' t like a guy , we just say " get the hell out .
if a friend come , we' d have an extra bunk .
we' d say " why don' t you spend the night ? " and , by god , he would .
we' d have a dog and a couple of cats , but you got to make sure them cats don' t get them rabbits .
but ... you just let them try .
i' m gonna break them goddamn cats ' necks .
i smash them cats with a stick .
you know a place like this ?
suppose i do .
what' s it to you ?
how much they want for a place like that ?
could get it for 600 bucks .
600 .
old people that owns it is broke .
i ain' t much good with only one hand .
that' s why they give me a job sweeping .
and they give me $250 cos i lost my hand .
and i got 50 more saved in the bank right now .
that' s , uh ... 300 .
and i got 50 more coming at the end of the month .
suppose i went in with you fellas .
that' d be $350 that i' d put in .
now , let me tell you something .
i could cook , and i could tend the chickens , and i could hoe in the garden .
huh ?
now , how would that be ?
ok .
i got to think about that .
we was gonna do it by ourselves .
we were gonna do it by ourselves .
well , now , wait a minute .
i' il tell you what .
i' d make a will and leave my share to you guys in case i kick off .
i ain' t got no relatives or nothin ' .
you fellas got any money ?
maybe we can do it now .
we got ten bucks between us .
we got ten bucks .
ten bucks .
yeah .
you seen what they done to my dog ?
they said he wasn' t no good no more .
i wish somebody' d shoot me when i ain' t no good , but they won' t do that .
they' li can me , and i ain' t gonna have no place to go .
look , if me and lennie work a month and we don' t spend nothin ' , we' li have 1 00 bucks .
and you got 350 ?
yeah , and you can have every cent of it .
that' d be 450 .
jesus christ , i bet we could get it for that .
you two could get her started .
i' d work and make up the rest .
i' m gonna take that goddamn pup .
sure , sure , sure .
you know what i' m gonna do ?
i' il write those two old people that we' il take it .
candy will send $1 00 to hold it ?
i sure will .
i' li have 30 more dollars the time you guys is ready to quit .
i get to tend the rabbits .
tell him , george .
tell him he can' t do it .
i' il get to hoe in the garden , even if i ain' t no good at it ?
they got a nice stove there ?
yeah , yeah .
they got a real nice stove !
but i bet that pup will like it there .
we' re gonna do it , goddamnit .
we can fix up that little old place and live there .
when we gonna do it ?
one month .
right smack in one month .
now , don' t tell nobody about it .
just us three and nobody else .
don' t tell nobody .
george , i ought to have shot that dog myself .
i should not let no stranger shoot my dog .
shut up .
i' m tired of ...
i just asked you !
you' ve been asking me too often and i' m damn sick of it .
if you can' t look after your goddamn wife , what do you expect me to do about it , huh ?
lay off me .
didn' t mean nothing by it .
i said lay off .
just thought you might have seen her .
tell her to stay home .

why can' t i talk to you ?
i never get to talk to nobody .
i get awful lonely .
i ain' t supposed to talk to you .
you can talk to people , but i can' t talk to nobody but curley , or else he gets mad .
how' d you like not to talk to anybody ?
what you got covered up there ?
i ...
that' s the pup .
that' s the little pup .
why , it' s dead .
but i was just playin ' with him .
don' t you worry none .
he' s just a mutt .
you can get another one , easy .
well , it ain' t that so much , but george ain' t gonna let me tend them rabbits now .
why don' t he ?
well , he said when ...
i did any bad things , then i wouldn' t be able to tend them rabbits .
don' t you worry about talking to me .
listen to the guys yell .
they ain' t gonna leave till it' s over .
i ain' t supposed to talk to you .
george said he' d give me hell .
he told me this .
well , what' s the matter with me ?
ain' t i got a right to talk to nobody ?
george says you get the people in a mess .
oh , nuts .
what kinda harm am i doing to you ?
i tell ya , i ain' t used to living like this .
i could' ve made something outta myself .
maybe i will yet .
a show come through salinas , and i met one of the actors .
he says i could go with the show .
my old lady wouldn' t let me , but this guy says i coulda .
if i went , i wouldn' t be living like this .
you bet .
say , we were supposed to get a little place and then get rabbits .
another time , i met a guy he was in the pictures .
went out to the riverside dance palace with him .
he says he was gonna put me in the movies .
he says i was a natural .
as soon as he got back to hollywood he was gonna write to me about it .
i never did get that letter .
i always thought my old lady stole it , too .
she said no .
so , um ...
i married curley .
met him out at the riverside dance palace that same night .
are you listenin ' ?
sure .
i ain' t told this to nobody before .
and maybe i oughtn' t to .
i don' t like curley .
he ain' t a nice fella .
i could' ve been in the movies .
had nice clothes .
this guy said i was a natural .
maybe if you took this pup and you throwed him away , then george would never know and i' d get to tend them rabbits with no trouble .
what makes you so nuts about rabbits ?
i like to pet nice things with the fingers .
soft things .
well , who don' t ?
everybody likes that .
do you like to feel velvet ?
you bet , by god .
i had me some too .
the lady give me some and then i lost it .
you' re nuts .
but you' re kinda a nice fella .
just like a big baby .
sometimes when i' m doing my hair , i just sit and stroke it cos it' s so soft .
feel right here .
that' s nice .
