season 4 episode 12
by joke0 & k5
airdate : unknown .
the impossible has happened .
it would take days to recount the event' s i' ve witnessed .
so , settle in .
it all began ...
quiet you !
this court martial is now in session !
the honourably sexy zapp brannigan residing .
bring in the accused !
oh my !
phillip j. fry .
you stand accused of travelling to the forbidden planet omega 3 , a crime punishable by 12 concurrent death sentences .
you understand the charges ?
1 beep for " yes " , 2 beeps for " no " ,
yes " , so noted .
do you plead guilty ?
double " yes " .
guilty !
i will now carry out the sentences .
kif , my gun .
wait !
he plead not guilty .
order !
order in the court !
very well then mr fry .
please recount the events that lead you to be guilty .
the professor said he was taking a brief nap , so we only have time for 6 movies .
lets take these 6 jim carrey movies and record over them .
you know what 6 movies average out to be really good ?
the first six star trek movies !
everybody hit the deck !
those words are forbidden !
quels mots ?
star trek ?
shut your gills !
that sound !
patrol car 718 !
hide him !
the court is intrigued .
perhaps we could hear more about these forbidden words , from someone with a sexilly seductive voice .
with pleasure .
you see the show was banned after the star trek wars .
you mean after the vast migration of star wars fans ?
no , that was the star wars trek .
by the 23rd century star trek fandom had evolved ... from the loose assosciation of nerds with skin problems into a full blown religion . and scotty beamed them to the klingon ship where they would be no tribble at all .  all power to the engines .
as country after country fell under its influence , world leaders became threatened by the movement' s power .
and so the trekkies were executed in the manner most befitting virgins .
he' s dead jim !
finally , the sacred texts were banned ..
the last copies of the 79 episodes and 6 movies were dumped on the forbidden world omega 3 .
along with that blooper reel where the door doesn' t close all the way .
last , star trek was forever scoured from human memory .
another classic science fiction show cancelled before its time .
i' ve never heard of such a brutal and shocking injustice that i cared so little about .
next witness !
will bender the robot please take the stand .
she' s all yours buddy !
i' d only met the defendant fry once , but i knew he was up to no good .
please use the beeps .
mr nimoy .
i came as soon as i heard what happened centuries ago .
i can' t believe your show was banned .
i have absolutely no idea what you' re talking about .
you know .
1966 , 79 episodes , about 30 good ones .
oh really , i' ve done too many things to remember one particular tv series .
but if you want to discuss my books of poetry ...
c' mon !
remember that episode where you go high on spores and smacked kirk around ?
no .
perhaps you' re thinking of my one man show about vincent van spock .
i mean van gogh !
damn !
you can' t escape it !
oh you' re right i can' t .
jeez , don' t get upset .
i mean , ok i outwitted you but ...
no , it' s my fellow cast members .
300 years ago they left earth behind .
this planet doesn' t appreciate us anymore , leonard .
bill , you are , and always shall be , my friend .
but i just signed a 6 month lease on my apartment .
i can' t walk away from a commitment like that .
very well my friend .
why did the world turn its back on our obvious greatness ?
i' m literally angry with rage !
your co stars may be gone but we can still get those episode tapes back for the whole world to see !
come on !
yesss !
front row !
you can' t go to omega 3 !
it' s forbidden , i forbid you !
but we have to .
the world needs star trek to give people hope for the future .
but it' s set 800 years in the past !
yeah , why is this so important to you ? ' cause it , it taught me so much .
like how you should accept people .
whether they be black , white , klingon or even female .
but most importantly , when i didn' t have any friends ... it made me feel like maybe i did .
well , that is touchingly pathetic .
i guess i can' t let you go alone .
i' il go too .
with leonard' s permission of course .
we' re entering the omega system .
you are now in forbidden space .
forbidden shmershmidden !
what are they gonna do ?
write a letter ?
i' m so scared !
i' ve lost control of the ship !
dip !
dip indeed !
it' s all stuff from that forbidden show .
so many cardboard sets , so many memories .
if only the others ...
i guess thats my cue .
bill !
eldo !
this is wonderful !
oh man .
i feel like hugging you .
well i would but you have no body !
and we' re both men .
nichelle !
george !
walter !
deforest !
welshey !
welshey ?
we did some musical reunion specials in the 2200' s , but the guy who played scotty had trouble yodelling .
ever since then , welshey has been a welcome participant in our escapades .
i can' t believe it !
how' d you all end up here ?
we were on our way to welshey' s cousin' s house to stay in the guest room , when our ship was pulled down to this planet and crashed .
just like yours .
when we woke up , we had these bodies .
say it in russian !
ven ve voke up ve had these wodies .
now say nuclear wessels !
no !
you' il love it here !
everything is provided for us .
and we never age .
check out these abs .
but who' s doing all this for you ?
you know we never thought about it .
we' re famous celebrities we' re used to this sort of treatment .
it is i !
what a cheesy effect !
i am not an effect !
you doubt my power ?
i do !
welsheeeeeeeey !!
this court will now hear some very sensual testemony ... from this court' s ex lover , turanga leela .
go [ beep ] yourself .
behold another power , different from the one you saw earlier .
hey !
a body !
buff , tanned .
yeah , this is mine alright !
alright you gas !
what' s the deal ?
centuries ago , the videotaped adventures ... of the enterprise crew rained down upon my planet .
over and over i watched them .
especially the 5 with the energy beings .
i am melilvar !
seer of the tapes !
knower of the episodes !
tremble before my encyclopeadic knowledge of star trek !
tremble ?
i laugh .
no one knows more about star trek than me !
i beg to differ .
long have i waited for the one who played spock .
at last , we can begin .
cool !
a star trek convention !
melilvar can you give us some idea of how long this is going to last ?
until time stops .
you can' t do this !
now , we have a full schedule of events ...
can people who hate star trek leave ?
good question !
no you have to stay even longer .
sign it to melilvar .
melilvar has three i' s .
i think i' ve done enough conventions to know how to spell " melilvar " .
say " nerd " !
nerd !
i' m ... slim shady .
yes .
i' m the real shady .
all you other slim shady' s ... are just imitating .
so ... won' t the real slim shady ... please stand up ... please stand up ... please stand up ow can you do a spoken word version of a rap song ?
he found a way .
for one hundred quatloos ...
who did the captain maroon on ceti alpha v ?
khaaan !
khan ?
correct .
my button has broken .
the trivia contest has ended .
i now have a surprise .
you will perform a fan script , written by the ultimate trek fan .
you have my fan script ?
i meant me !
melilvar is the ultimate fan !
i was confused because the scoreboard says something different !
trivia contest over !
take your scripts !
we have limited rehearsal time .
i didn' t make enough copies of the script so , george and walter will have to share .
you probably don' t want us to see you rehearsing or it' il give away the ending .
that' s right !
the ending must not be ruined !
we' il go wait in the ship .
ok .
not until i get my 600 quatloos .
this is wrong .
we shouldn' t have abandoned them there .
i dunno .
i' m feeling pretty good about it .
i didn' t want to leave them either fry , but what are we supposed to do ?
well , usually on the show , someone would come up with a complicated plan , then explain it with a simple analogy .
if we can reroute engine power through the primary weapons , and ... reconfigure them to melilvar' s frequency ... that should overload his electro quantum structure ..
like putting too much air in a ballon !
of course !
it' s so simple !
alas ... my ship ... whom i love like a woman ... is ... disabled .
oh lord !
fascinating , captain , and logical too .
we need some help .
look , captain .
melilvar will help us .
keptin , i wope he vill help our ... vessel .
wessel !!
you' re not acting hard enough !
melilvar , you have to respect your actors .
when i was directing star trek iv ,
i got a magnificent performance out of bill because i respected him so much .
and when i directed star trek v , i got a magnificent performance out of me ... because i respected me so much !
ok !
i' m done rekafoobling the energy motron .
or , whatever .
fire !
my , what a handsome energy creature you are .
i love you .
hey you wrote it !
its not working .
he' s drawing straight from our weapons .
like a balloon when ... something bad happens .
so uh , how' s rehearsal going ?
lousy .
here i' ve been admiring a bunch of actors while you , a crew of genuine space heroes , risked your lives to save them .
hey !
we' ve done heroic things too !
yeah !
in the third season i kissed shatner !
silence !!
my whole world has turned upside down .
i have but one option .
keep them and let us go ?
no !
to determine who is more worthy of my fanatical devotion ...
i shall pit you together against each other in armed combat .
to the death !!
where' d you get an idiotic idea like that ?
episodes 19 , 46 , 56 and 77 .
great list .
except , you forgot episode 66 !
i was getting to that one !!
so melilvar ordered a battle to the death .
i assume no one survived .
can we get on with this ?
my foot' s getting tired !
this will be a standard battle to the death .
the only weapons : whatever you can find .
but i warn you : do nothing until i signal the start of combat !
ok start .
i don' t have much experience of fighting .
except with you guys .
i have an idea .
wasn' t there an episode where i threw my shoe at the enemy ?
you mean doohan ?
whoever it was , i did it like this .
my foot' s cold !
there .
we can make these into spears .
and we can tie these caterpillars together to make bow strings for bows and arrows .
and we can use this machine gun to shoot them !
that was fun !
what if i distract them with my famous fan dance ?
oh yes good good good good .
and the george , you give them a karate chop !
i find that offensive .
just because i' m of japanese ancestry , you assume i know karate .
have i ever lead you to belive i' ve studied karate ?
well no , but you never talk about yourself .
maybe if you showed a little interest .
well .
here goes nothing .
hello boys !
there' s no right way to hit a woman .
then do it the wrong way .
fine .
is that all you' ve got ?
come on walter !
take that !
that hurts !
lets see if this actually works !
my face !
my face too !
may i ?
excellent !
excellent !
leela , please .
this is exactly what melilvar wants .
we' re just pawns in his diabolical game of checkers .
can' t we resolve our differences in some other way ?
melilvar !
dinnertime !
but mom !
i' m playing with my collectables !
now !!
all this time we thought he was a powerful superbeing , when he was just a child .
he' s not a child , he' s 34 !
all right koenig , i' ve wanted to do this for years !
bender wait !
this is our chance to escape , before melilvar comes back .
but we all need to work together .
we' ve decided to work together .
hmm , so did they .
now , how do we escape ?
we can' t use our ship .
the life support works but the engines are wrecked .
ironic .
because our engines work , but our life support systems don' t .
hey , if your engines work ... ... and your life support systems work ...
stop !!
you' re just goin ' around in circles !
think fry , think !
everyone' s depending on you .
we' re too heavy .
you guys need to lose some weight .
fast !
look leonard !
we' re light enough to keep the tapes !
isn' t that great ?
i' m living in a cafilterfish jar .
we did it !
melilvar' s got a spaceship !
yes in mint condition .
and you made me take it out of the package !
the nimbus !
we' re saved !
you' re under arrest .
prepare to be boarded .
so i boarded you then .
what happened next ?
you started this stupid court martial .
now if you don' t mind we' re still fighting melilvar !
one more hit and we' re done for !!
let' s take them out with us .
do you guys have a self destruct code ?
like destruct sequence 1a2b3 ...
thanks a lot takei , now everybody knows !
if i can' t have the original cast of star trek , no one will !!
prepare to die !
wait !
if they mean that much to you , why do you wanna kill them ?
because i ... i ... i dunno what i' d do without them .
melilvar , you can' t let a tv show be your whole life .
you can do anything you want .
look at walter koenig .
after star trek , he became an actor !
not just an actor , but a well rounded person .
with my own friends , credit cards , keys .
well i guess i could move out of my parents ' basement ... maybe get a temp job .
one step at a time .
i thank you fry .
you know , you and i are of a kind .
in a different reality i could have called you " friend " .
episode 10 , " balance of terror " .
more like episode 9 , loser !
in your face !
victory is mine !
i wonder my friends , was he really such an evil energy gas ?
he did give us eternal youth .
24 hour laundromat .
a full assortment of rum both spiced and regular .
truly , he was a paradise .
and all you had to put up with was one really annoying star trek fan .
let' s get the hell outta here !
