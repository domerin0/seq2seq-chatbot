you were right , varinia .
vengeance alone is not enough .
to become like your enemy is to lose to him .
but what' s important isn' t our living or our dying but this new thing we' ve created , however briefly .
a world without slaves .
and if you die , who will tell that story ?
live so that i will live .
so that we will live on .
so that it won' t be wasted or forgotten .
did you see the look he gave you , varinia ?
i didn' t .
and even if i had , i wouldn' t care .
what sort of look ?
what look , you ?
what look ?
ow !
what look ? !
varinia !
hyah !
no !
' i made a promise once to tell our story .
' it began here in a small village in gaul where i was born a free woman .
' then the romans came and destroyed my world and made me a slave .
' nothing and no one could stand against the romans .
' but rome herself was torn by conflict .
' bloody civil wars raged for years
' between the plebeians and their rivals , the patricians ,
' led by senators like marcus crassus , the richest man in the world .
' as a child , he had seen his father murdered in the forum .
' crassus had risen from the ashes of his family' s defeat
' to unlimited wealth and unlimited ambition .
' ambition kept in check only by his rivals , like antonius agrippa .
' the civil wars were over .
men smiled at one another in public .
' but the fighting never stopped . '
agrippa .
fishing for votes ?
no , just enjoying our democratic way of life .
a new wine .
from spain .
delicious .
but i like your cupbearer better .
any news from spain ?
a great victory by pompey .
another ?
the man is positively boring in his triumphs .
i shall console myself with the way crassus must feel .
pompey' s no great warrior .
i heard he' s got so fat on the riches of his triumphs he can barely ride his horse .
disparage pompey all you like but the man gets the job done .
victory over vermin ridden gaulish peasants is hardly the mark of military distinction .
they say he will be consul .
this grape ... .. is not to my satisfaction .
more wine .
i think i' m going to borrow your wife , cornelius .
' the wealth of a man like crassus could be seen in gold or silver
' but its true measure was in flesh .
' thousands of slaves .
' they lived out their short lives in a world of suffering
' at the whim of their masters .
' no roman citizen gave them a second thought . '
over there .
greetings , citizens .
today we offer a group of barbarians from gaul , courtesy of the great pompey .
ahoy , batiatus .
what brings you up from capua ?
the same thing as you , i would imagine .
my stock needs freshening .
although how a modest man from the country can bid against a senator ...
i might as well go home .
a modest man from the country ?
yours is widely known as the finest gladiatorial school in all ltaly .
you flatter me .
no , not in the least .
look at this beauty .
and a virgin .
a virgin .
given the appetite of our frontier troops , i rather doubt that .
being a virgin is overrated .
it' s just an excuse to inflate the price .
good teeth .
wide hips .
and an excellent breeder .
magnificent .
she' s easy on the eye , i' il grant you , but these gauls have thin blood .
they rarely last the winter .
it would be throwing money away .
why , batiatus , are you in love ?
don' t worry , my friend .
i won' t bid against you .
oh , you' re too kind , senator .
though i may need a favor someday .
oh ...
of course .
of course .
500 sesterces !
done !
how can the senate choose pompey over you as the next consul ?
it would be a close vote .
i bought you a gift .
it' s beautiful .
you are too generous .
am l ?
i suppose i might be .
' ln the arms of the richest man in rome
' and her husband' s best friend ... '
show me . ' .. helena might be forgiven her ignorance of the origin of that bracelet , its true cost .
' what is hell ?
' hell is that place where the simplest action becomes painful .
' where it hurts to walk ... '
move it ! ' .. to breathe , even to think .
' the gold mines of egypt were such a hell .
' among the thracian slaves condemned to an early death
' there was one who would shake the roman world .
' his name spartacus . '
pick it up !
pick it up !
no !
stop !
so he' s a thracian , yes ?
worse .
he' s an animal .
good .
that' s even better .
this is your lucky day , thracian .
what kind of a place is this ?
hah !
hah !
move !
fresh meat !
shut your hole !
get back to work .
you stink , animals .
clean yourselves .
this way .
i want all these chopped into thin slices .
i would not serve this to a dog !
i could get used to this .
i am gannicus .
this is spartacus .
david the jew .
he never talks .
some say he can' t .
you' re thracians ?
the crowd likes thracians .
be quiet , nordo .
eat .
didn' t get your name , friend .
you are not my friend .
i don' t want to know your name or your story .
why not ?
because i might meet you in the arena , and then i will kill you .
why wait ?
you' il get plenty of chances to fight .
save it for when you have no choice .
eat .
you must be the new thracians .
i can always tell thracians .
you stink like pigs .
you must be crixus .
you' ve heard of me .
who hasn' t ?
crixus of the big nose .
i' m not surprised you could smell us .
enough !
to your cells !
now !
well , move , slaves !
you , spartacus .
where did you learn to fight ?
when a roman asks you a question , you answer , slave .
fighting romans .
good day to you , crassus .
crassus .
what a pleasant surprise .
i had no idea you still partook of such common pleasures as our public baths .
i do not disdain the public .
ah .
you love mankind .
it' s only people you can' t stand .
now , why is it that those who are most in favor of mob rule stand most to benefit from the public' s greed and stupidity ?
why is it that the rich are always so keen on reform after they' ve made their fortune and not before ?
the republic was a fine form of government when rome was a backwater city state .
times have changed .
rome rules the world now .
and one man with a strong vision must rule rome .
so power ... should be wielded by whom ?
the educated ?
the wealthy ?
the aristocrat ?
by crassus ?
or by pompey ?
well , plato did say that leadership must be left to the educated .
that leaves pompey out .
julius caesar , you mean .
you' ve heard what they say about him ?
every woman' s man and every man' s woman .
but you' re right , pompey overreaches .
lf he' s not careful , his head will be found hanging in the forum just like that of your father and your brother .
was it something i said ?
this ... is the roman short sword , the gladius , from which you get your names .
22 inches long .
three pounds in weight .
a stabbing weapon for close work .
you kill a man with this and you can smell his sweat , taste his breath .
but you sons of whores are not worthy of fighting with the gladius yet .
so you will use these wooden swords while i teach you .
you , slave .
pick it up .
come at me .
again .
too slow , slave .
pick it up .
too slow .
cinna !
so what do you think of our thracian slaves ?
good , huh ?
they have spirit but no real talent .
i see .
so you think they' re just lucky ?
and cinna , this boy was very expensive .
don' t damage my property .
enough !
go !
bring her .
come .
come here .
very good .
better .
come .
let me smell your hair .
oh ...
you know ...
..
i can be a very good master .
oh , yes .
now , now ... now .
now , kiss me .
no !
no !
no !
hold her !
no !
no !
hey , spartacus .
how' s your nose ?
you got lucky .
do i have to break it again ?
so where did you fight romans ?
thrace .
you ?
gaul , where i was caught .
then later in sicily where slaves rebelled .
you rebelled ?
two times .
the romans , they were terrified of us .
they still are .
now they kill a man just for talking about it .
why did it fail ?
fighting romans is like fighting a grist mill .
the stone keeps on turning .
no matter how many times you attack it , in the end it grinds you down to dust .
faster !
put your backs into it , you sons of whores !
why do africans use the spear and net ?
it amuses the romans to turn us into fishermen .
i was a farmer .
i never saw a net until i came here .
nordo , this man is trouble .
leave him be .
draba , they ever pit the knife against the spear ?
the spear always wins .
enough talking !
back to work .
well , move , you scum !
put your body behind the blow !
good , draba !
push him back .
faster !
harder !
are you men or are you women ?
tomorrow some of you have the honor of fighting in the arena in capua .
nothing matters but that you fight well and with courage .
do this and even the defeated may receive mercy .
however , if that is not your fate then the crowd will expect you to meet your death honorably , in the roman manner , like this .
spartacus ... kneel .
a defeated gladiator may beg for mercy by raising his hand thus .
the death blow is delivered in a single thrust to the neck ... here .
that is how a gladiator from the house of batiatus dies .
what' s the matter , thracian ?
lost your appetite ?
eat !
drink !
tomorrow we die .
i' m not dying tomorrow .
the gods decide when we die .
i don' t believe in the gods .
you don' t believe in the gods ?
when i look at the heavens i see only stars .
blasphemer !
you could be struck down for that .
no bolt of lightning .
so what do you believe in ?
us .
our will .
we decide when we die and how .
eat anyway .
you' il need your strength for tonight .
what happens tonight ?
war , little thracian .
sweet war !
quiet !
sit down !
a little wisdom .
a man is no good in the arena if his parts shrivel up .
a gladiator is not a litter slave .
he is a man .
yeah !
and a man needs a woman .
quiet , quiet .
for those of you who fight tomorrow ,
i graciously lend you these lovelies .
use them well .
and in the morning , show me what men you are !
cinna !
this is yours .
ldiot !
david doesn' t fight tomorrow .
crixus .
you like to play rough , thracian .
here .
batiatus asks that she be made more pliant .
see to it .
come here , woman !
i' m spartacus .
what are you called ?
you look cold .
here .
the stones are cold at night .
you sleep there .
i won' t bother you .
wake up , you sons of whores !
line up by the doors !
get a move on down there !
my name is varinia .
varinia .
come on , out .
today you are expected to bring honor to the house of batiatus .
fail to do so and you will curse the day you were born .
where are they going ?
capua .
they fight today .
the thracian , the one they call spartacus . ls he any good ?
couldn' t say .
he' s different , though .
how ?
all the gladiators here are strong men .
brave .
but they are still slaves .
they accept it .
not him .
he will not last long .
you were with him last night ?
yes and no .
you , girl !
come here !
you will attend me at the games but if you give me any trouble ,
i promise that our previous encounter will feel like a mother' s caress .
now , go and get yourself cleaned up .
line up !
i appreciate your contribution to my games , batiatus .
few people understand the financial burden i' m expected to shoulder while on duty in these dreary provinces .
thank you .
and i appreciate the loan of your troops .
security at an establishment like mine does not come cheaply either .
one hand washes the other .
of course .
more wine !
a perfectly ripened pear .
although somewhat bruised .
a problem with discipline .
but we' re working on it .
aren' t we ?
yes , my lord .
on the crosses who are they ?
arsonists .
they wear the tunica molesta , soaked in pitch .
change your mind about the gods ?
lf there are gods in this world , they' re not here .
burn !
burn !
burn !
burn !
crixus ...
.. versus gaius .
gannicus ...
.. versus antonius .
spartacus ...
versus commodus .
this new gladiator , spartacus .
ls he really a thracian or are you still passing off greeks ?
he' s the real thing , through and through .
any good ?
cinna thinks the world of him .
don' t you , cinna ?
very well .
a thousand on spartacus .
let' s see some killing !
kill !
kill !
kill !
kill !
are you hurt ?
i thought in the mines i' d seen man at his worst .
i was wrong .
a slave has no choice .
not me .
the ones who watched , took their pleasure in blood and death .
well , move , slaves !
harder !
faster !
put your back to it !
can' t you lay with me , spartacus ?
ls it because cinna ordered it ?
because cinna ordered it .
and because thracian men and women are to remain chaste until married .
slaves don' t marry .
i would marry you .
marriage requires a holy man .
i thought you didn' t believe in the gods .
i believe in what i can see , hear and touch .
my tribe believes man was created by the gods .
that they live in us .
we' re flesh and blood , that' s all .
that is what an animal is .
the romans say that we are animals .
that we are without souls .
but you are afraid to say that you agree with the romans .
i believe that i never met anyone like you , varinia of gaul ... and that i love you .
will you marry me ?
on what , then , would you make a vow ?
on the blood that flows through my veins and the breath i take ,
i will be yours until the day i die , and in my life there' il be no other but you , i swear .
on the blood that flows in my veins and the breath i take ,
i will be yours ...
until the ...
until the day i die .
and in the life beyond .
how do you know there is a life beyond ?
i have faith .
there will be no other man but you .
i swear .
kill !
kill !
kill !
kill !
spartacus !
spartacus !
spartacus !
master .
we have visitors , master , from rome .
cornelius lucius and his wife , helena .
and marcus crassus .
marcus crassus is here , and you left him waiting outside ?
oh !
noble crassus .
you do me a great honor , sir .
i am lentulus batiatus .
please , sit .
i and my establishment are here to serve you .
some ...
some wine to wash away the dust , and some honeyed ice , perhaps ?
yes ?
how may i serve you ?
my friends and i would appreciate a private showing of a pair of thracians .
excellent choice .
your honor is obviously a connoisseur .
to the death .
to the death ?
that' s an unusual request for a private showing .
i see that' s you' re joking .
that' s very good .
that' s very amusing .
i am not laughing .
of course you' re not .
well , you' ve asked for thracians .
that means that you must want good dagger work .
and i have the best in the world .
but if you want to the death , you won' t see nuance , and you won' t see subtlety .
certainly won' t see quality .
madam .
i' m not a butcher , sir , i am an artist .
yes .
i want to give you good fighting .
good fighting .
and to the death .
i want to see courage .
i want to see passion .
and above all , i want to see finality .
but to the death will cost you .
25, 000 denarii .
you could buy an elephant for that .
done .
and i want no fakery .
no sucking the sand and pretending that they' re dying .
lf one of them is down , or if both of them are down ,
i want one of your trainers to cut their throats .
and they are to understand that .
now , i shall leave 10, 000 on account , and the rest when we have been satisfied .
note the africans .
theirs is the finest combat and the most skillful but it can be a bore .
it can go on and on .
to see fighting at its best you must see thracians .
don' t you agree , slave master ?
yes , but each kind has its own virtues .
change of plan .
match me a thracian against a black .
with all due respect , my lord , that is no match .
when a thracian' s dagger is in the net , he' s finished .
yes , perhaps .
but the africans are not noted for their strategic thinking .
hannibal , of course , being the exception .
i want to see how long a mentally superior but lesser armed man can last .
my lord , that sort of experimentation makes for bad blood with the men .
well , for 25, 000 denarii i think you can afford to incur a little bad blood .
begin !
order !
what is it ?
what is it ?
a private fight .
who do you want ?
draba .
draba !
and david .
david !
now , he' s a jew , yes ?
yes , i know you wanted a thracian ...
no , no , no .
this is interesting .
ever seen a jew fight ?
exceptional with the dagger and reputed to be very bright , as well .
who else ?
er ...
spartacus ... and polymus .
polymus ... spartacus .
spartacus ?
how do you like them ?
all except that one .
i don' t like him .
forgive me , lady , but that man has been in the ring 12 times .
he' s very good , very strong , very quick .
who will you match him with ?
the african .
what are you doing ?
praying .
how do you pray ?
i can show you .
will you do something for me ?
something that we do in our tribe ?
put your mouth on mine and breathe your soul into me , and i' il breathe mine into you .
and then for all time our souls will be one .
one soul in two bodies .
i will come back to you .
lf you don' t , i will kill you myself .
you have to save your strength for tomorrow .
i am full of strength .
dagger against net and trident .
what kind of match is that ?
time .
time !
what are they thinking , i wonder ?
gladiators are animals , pure and simple .
lf one thinks of them as people , one loses all perspective .
ls it true what they say about the jews ?
how they mutilate their boys ?
would you like to see ?
bring me the jew before he fights .
bring the jew here .
the rest of you , to the house of expectation .
unclothe .
unclothe .
they do that to their children ?
how beastly .
perhaps that explains their skill with the knife .
i want the jew to fight first .
of course , sir .
strike !
kill him !
kill him !
kill him .
kill him , jew !
why doesn' t he kill him ?
kill him !
why didn' t he finish him ?
don' t expect mercy from me out there , thracian .
live , draba .
that' s what life is for .
lf the gods love you ... you die in childhood .
that was extraordinary .
lf the second pair is as good as the first , then i shall be well pleased .
strike !
kill him !
kill him !
kill him !
kill him !
strike now !
stop him !
why didn' t he kill me ?
lf he kills me , he lives .
lf he turns on the romans , he dies .
he chooses to die .
who chooses to die ?
who chooses to die ?
maybe rather than live as a beast ,
draba chose to die as a man .
father !
shh .
it was just a dream .
no .
i slept until now .
now i wake .
move , you dogs !
march !
i said move !
move !
move , you scum !
ls it true that draba didn' t kill any of the romans ?
lf a man must throw his life away , he could die better than that .
will you die any better ?
he will die like a dog and so will you .
so will we all .
are you my friend , crixus ?
was draba your friend ?
yes .
and my teacher .
did he teach you how to die ?
he taught me how to live .
i feed you the best food .
i give you women .
you live here like kings in idleness on the fat of the land .
and all i expect is your loyalty and obedience .
and what do i get in return ?
treachery .
cinna , fetch me a black man .
kill him .
now there will be no more trouble .
the dogs won' t even growl .
move it , move it , you cows !
move , slaves !
are we dogs that you snap your whips at us ?
spartacus !
prepare to die !
cinna !
what the hell is going on out there ?
there' s too many !
you taught me well , cinna .
quiet !
quiet !
let him speak !
quiet !
listen to spartacus !
like you , i' ve been alone my whole life .
we could never look into each other' s eyes .
living like animals !
here is the lesson of draba .
i will be a man .
my life is my brother' s .
live to fight the romans !
smash the gates !
master !
the gladiators !
they have revolted !
don' t just stand there like a drooling idiot .
help me !
field formation !
go get my litter .
we have to get to capua .
to the garrison .
go !
to victory !
free men and women , listen to me !
we must get ready .
nordo , can you open the armory ?
lf i have to break the door with my teeth .
spartacus , look .
david , go .
go .
talk to them .
what do you want me to say ?
lnvite our brothers to join us .
gifts !
i bring gifts !
freedom for you and your children !
come , join us !
freedom for you !
join us !
spartacus always said that you would speak some day .
david , varinia .
come .
you' il tell me later .
there' s one more thing i need to do .
maecenus !
maecenus !
oh , thank you , thank you .
you' ve got to stop them .
where is that slave scum headed ?
ln the hills to the south of here .
there' s a lot of valuable property .
you must save something !
too late for that .
double time !
march !
please .
please .
come on .
let' s go .
look at them .
they' re so arrogant , they' ve lost their formation .
so ?
so if attacked , they' d have to fight , man to man .
and who fights better man to man than gladiators , huh ?
crixus , nordo ...
we have guests .
should we not greet them ?
retreat !
apparently there has been an uprising of gladiators in capua .
the entire garrison has been slain and the slaves have taken to the hills , where their revolt spreads .
this is what i am talking about .
this is why we need strong leadership .
i propose that we send the city cohorts to crush this rebellion immediately .
the entire garrison of rome ?
are you out of your mind ?
to fight slaves ?
how many of these dangerous creatures are there ?
who are they led by ?
it is a job for an overseer and a pack of dogs .
they massacred the entire capua garrison .
the garrison at capua ...
forgive my bluntness , but an effete band of pretend soldiers .
a slave rebellion is never a simple affair .
we all remember sicily .
twice the slaves attacked .
the second time , they seized the entire island for over a year !
this particular revolt is taking place a mere 100 miles from where we now sit and squabble .
are you suggesting that we recall a legion from the frontier ?
pompey , perhaps ?
and wait weeks for him ?
will the slaves wait ?
i don' t think so .
we must deal with this matter promptly before it gets out of hand .
but the entire city cohorts ?
three .
three full cohorts .
under whose command ?
i realize that it is not customary for a man to put his own name forward .
then please do not break precedent .
i was about to suggest that the cohorts be sent under the able command of titus glabrus .
my lord , i hardly know what to say .
thank you for your confidence in me .
lf it is the will of the senate and the people of rome , then i accept .
lf it is indeed the will of the senate , then , titus glabrus , go with our blessings .
fall upon this rabble with all the weight and majesty of roman law .
we will march across the world and turn it over , stone by stone !
look at them .
they think the war is all won .
it hasn' t even started .
how are we going to feed them or clothe them , much less train them to fight the roman empire ?
by teaching them to share the burden .
like free men .
why did you propose glabrus ?
he' s as thick as he is vain .
but politically dependable .
why didn' t you put yourself forward ?
agrippa would have blocked me out of spite .
besides , there' s little honor in defeating slaves and terrible shame if one fails .
lf glabrus succeeds , well , a minor rebellion is put down and he owes me a favor .
lf he fails , the whole city will be panicked .
and the senate will embrace a more permanent system of leadership .
fear isn' t a bad thing , caius .
it makes for a more malleable electorate .
crassus says he wants to be consul in order to restore the former glory of rome .
but really he wants to transform the consul into a more permanent position .
emperor .
the day that crassus becomes consul is the day the roman republic dies .
the time has come to make some decisions .
we must leave ?
and go where ?
i want to go home .
everywhere is the same as here .
everywhere it is master and slave .
i go where i go .
no man tells crixus what to do anymore .
come down , crixus .
this is crixus the gaul .
maybe the strongest man among us .
but still , he' s only one man .
can you bend this ?
now all of these .
we are like the arrows .
separately , we' re weak .
but together , we' re invincible .
and that' s why the romans worked so hard to divide us tribe by tribe .
we' re one tribe , then ?
yes !
ls that your will ?
yes !
who will lead us ?
stand up if you want to lead .
spartacus .
spartacus !
spartacus !
spartacus !
lf that is your wish .
but so one man doesn' t become a tyrant , we need laws .
what are they ?
whatever we take we hold together .
no man owns anything but his own weapon .
we could be rich with the gold we take .
we' il make the romans our slaves !
yeah !
i will not be a slave owner !
slavery is an evil .
an evil that turns all men slaves and slave masters into animals .
there will be equality and justice between man and woman .
we' re one tribe , then ?
yes .
one people ?
yes !
ls that your will ?
it is my will .
it is my will .
it is my will .
it is my will .
then this is what we' il do .
we' il go from plantation to plantation , from house to house , free the slaves , and fight anyone who tries to stop us .
and we' il make an end to rome and build a new world where there' il be no more slaves and no more masters !
what is going on up there ?
some plantation is burning the stubble .
there' s too much smoke for that .
then there' s a forest fire or something .
tell them to go faster .
helena !
faster !
why are you stopping ?
what is the meaning of this ?
whoever you are , you are blocking the path of a citizen of rome .
move out of the way .
pick up your litters !
pick up your litters !
pick up your litters !
glabrus wishes us to know that while he has not yet encountered the brigands , evidence of their atrocities is everywhere .
we have heard that any slave who does not join their ranks is put to the sword
and any roman unfortunate enough to encounter them
meets a fate worse than death .
it is with great regret that i report the murders of numerous nobles , " including cornelius lucius and his wife helena .
helena and cornelius lucius ?
are you sure ?
that is what it says .
the rebels ' leader is spartacus , a gladiator from thrace .
he has led them to mount vesuvius .
it is there that i intend to trap and dispose of them .
rest assured , i am mindful that i carry in my hands
the glory and majesty that is rome .
titus glabrus .
so we' re to be equals , are we ?
does that trouble you ?
well , i' il do what i can to raise myself but i make no promises .
you' d better .
a child needs a father it can look up to .
a child ?
we' re going to have a child ?
the slave army is climbing the north wall of the mountain , my lord .
a little less liberal use of the term " army " .
sorry , my lord .
we' il camp here for tonight .
why don' t we push on , my lord ?
cut off the slaves before the mountains ?
it' s cold , i' m tired and i' m hungry .
we' il camp here .
i like it .
it' s light but it' s strong .
spartacus , we need to talk .
this is a war council .
what' s a woman doing here ?
she has every right .
do women lead you ?
ls that why jews live under the romans ?
what' s the excuse of the gauls ?
david has news for us .
three cohorts of roman soldiers are on the road below us .
we' re trapped .
they' re so confident , they haven' t built a stockade .
1500 men .
i knew it .
i knew this would happen , thracian , but you insisted .
the people are tired .
they need rest .
well , the dead rest forever .
you must have known they would follow us .
how do we get off this mountain ?
what' s your plan ?
i don' t have one .
you don' t have a plan ?
from the moment i stood up in the training yard , i' ve only thought of the next move .
you must have an idea .
why must l ?
i' m no different from any of you .
lsn' t that the point ?
that we' re all equal ?
yes , but ...
so one of you figure it out !
he' il be fine .
they chose you as their leader .
i didn' t ask for that .
but you didn' t decline it either .
and why should you ?
you' re the only possible choice .
but now the time to lead has come .
when i was alone , all i had to lose was my own life .
now i have the lives of hundreds .
your life .
our child' s .
i have faith that you' il find the answer .
where ?
within the soul you say i have ?
yes .
you may not have chosen this moment , spartacus .
but it seems that this moment has chosen you .
my lord , have you given the troops permission to camp without building fortifications ?
the men are tired and i am tired .
when a roman army bivouacs it is customary to build a fort .
it' s just a handful of rotten slaves facing the same conditions we are .
with women and children and a tenth of our equipment .
a little while ago some of you were asking me if i had a plan .
and the plan is this .
we will attack first .
david , hold your men outside the camp until you hear my cry , and then charge in like the dogs of hell .
lf these don' t hold , i' il kill you myself .
lf these don' t hold , you won' t have to kill me .
we' il all be dead .
come on .
you can tell us now .
you are safe here .
i was asleep .
' i woke up to screaming .
' the sound of screaming .
' i was screaming .
' their men were everywhere , like ravenous beasts .
' and their women followed , feeding like harpies on the wounded .
' the killing went on and on . '
our men began to throw down their weapons and plead for their lives but there was no mercy .
how is it that you were spared ?
i don' t know why they chose me , my lord .
' all i know is , i was brought before their leader . '
my name is spartacus .
i have a message for your senate .
tell them that we , the slaves , say the roman way is corrupt and dead .
we want nothing from you .
leave us alone .
but if you come after us again , we will destroy you all .
by all that rome holds sacred ,
i will see her honor restored .
i will not rest ... until this spartacus ... hangs , crucified , at the gates of rome .
