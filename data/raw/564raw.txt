it was kenat up by the drugstore .
he made petra either sniff some glue or take a shot of horsch .
you mean " horse " .
yeah , horse .
the next time he bothers you , just tell him i' il cut his throat .
i can take care of myself .

but the next time you touch my shirts . . .
you have so many .
what the hell is that ?
who' s that lying in my bed ?
why , that' s tiipa , our neighbour .
poor thing has a drinking problem .
why did you put him in my bed ?
tell him to go lie in a trash can where he belongs .
as if you give a shit .
you have to get up .
we' re going to bed .
but we haven' t finished the film .
come on , petra .
it' s time to wake the hell up .
get out of here .
check out these tits .
that' s silicone .
anyone can see that .
they' re hard as a rock .
i wonder who gets to do these chicks ?
the guys with money .
the guys who have cash .
this watch is pretty neat .
patek chillip .
no , it' s called patek phillippe .
alex has one of those .
real expensive .
but he' s got no class .
that goddamned drunkard .
i' d cut off his cock .
they ought to offer rewards for his kind .
then i' d volunteer .
our lord , heavenly father .
we confess that we are unfortunately but poor , miserable sinners , and that we have no good in us .
for our hearts , flesh and blood have been so corrupted that we can never free ourselves of that evil desire .
hence , dear father , we ask you to forgive us our sins .
jocke , you' re late for class .
it' s a live show ?
did i miss much ?
no , he' s just getting fired up .
yes , that was palm sunday in the swedish hymn book .
does anyone know a hymn by heart ?
if you won' t give us a proper class , i' il tell the headmaster .
shut up , you nerd .
let' s just take it easy now .
banana jan , can' t you strip for us like you did at the school party ?
oh , okay .
then i opened my eyes , and there he stood .
long blond hair and pretty eyes .
has my prince finally arrived ?
hey , sis .
what the hell are you doing ?
i opened my eyes and gazed into his , and i was lost in the wonderful land of love .
what the hell is this ?
' hi there , my name is jocke . " '
is he a fag or what ?
never mind .
he' s in your school .
so it' s that bastard ?
if i ever see you together with that son of a bitch ,
i' il kick his nasty , little rat dick up his fucking conk .
he' d kick your arse .
what are you talking about ?
you' re sick .
is magne in ?
why ?
remember what i told you about that brat .
saucy sister .
what ?
i didn' t mean to . . .
you didn' t mean to what ?
go ahead and fuck her .
better you than that bastard jocke .
are these friends of yours ?
what' s going on ?
your daughter is becoming a harlot .
what in god' s name are you doing ?
what in god' s name are you doing ?
didn' t you see the red light ?
are you the deputy headmaster ?
i' m the father of gusten eriksson .
i simply demand that joakim vans and ray lopez will be expelled .
i want them out of my son' s class .
at this school we have a certain moral standard .
listen : burglary and vandalism .
three instances of assault .
another burglary .
multiple larcenies .
threats against an official .
this is confidential information from the social authorities .
where did you get it ?
never mind that .
but i have quite a few contacts .
this other kid doesn' t even have a guardian .
he has the authorities .
i find it reprehensible that such a bunch of layabouts are allowed to mingle with conscientious youngsters .
what about your own son ?
he smokes pot .
well , i' il be damned .
are you blaming my son now ?
you force him to mix with this kind of dregs .
if i were you , i' d be very careful with documents such as these .
the official secrets act is no joke .
i will shun no means to get you .
what do you mean by that ?
i happen to know that you have quite a few skeletons in the cupboard that you may not want to appear on public display .
we fully agree .
i' il fetch the boys , and then we' il go see the headmaster .
what the hell are you doing , man ?
why , he' s not a man , he' s a faggot .
shut up , you brats .
jocke , gurra , andy and ray will go to the headmaster .
now .
you' re in real deep shit now .
i have some pot on me .
hand it to me .
what' s going on ?
i' il leave this in my locker .
what have you got there ?
let me see .
take it easy .
can i see what you' ve got in your bag ?
do you live in your locker ?
you want to move in , you damn paki ?
come along now .
jocke , honey .
what the hell are you doing here ?
she' s boozed up .
that' s none of your business .
just kidding .
i wish i were drunk .
i can' t find my way around here .
give your mum a hug now .
stop it , mum .
stop being so disgusting .
stop it .
you stink !
i' ve summoned you to this meeting because of a police report concerning a brawl that took place on a subway station downtown .
i found it appropriate to summon the students in question along with their parents to discuss their behaviour .
what a load of crap .
they should be in reform school .
gustav , sit down .
look at him .
my son tells me that these delinquents force him to do . . .
. . . all sorts of devilry !
this school is way too lenient .
yes , but the purpose of this meeting was to discuss the matter .
a damned meeting isn' t enough .
action is what counts .
you either expel those punks , or i will make use of my contacts .
and then , by god . . .
take it easy .
shut up , you son of a bitch .
why do you call my son that ?
pipe down , you moaner .
go home and wear a dress .
let' s not get carried away .
what do you know about that ?
this is no school .
it' s an institution for the education of delinquents and punks .
the important thing is to listen to each other .
if we don' t , how can we solve our conflicts ?
i demand action .
i' ve listened enough to you two .
in situations like this people have to listen to each other .
that' s the basic premise for solving conflicts .
drop them .
is it exciting ?
are they worth shagging ?
look at that .
is anything happening ?
that wasn' t much of a party .
this is damn good pot .
i bought some for the party tonight .
what party ?
there' s a huge party tonight .
i' m going .
this stuff isn' t bad at all .
where did you get it ?
the coolest guy .
he' s my contact .
he told me about a clothes warehouse we can plunder .
they have no alarm system .
i' m off .
it' s too smoky in here .
say " hi " to your mum .
what kind of clothes is it ?
it' s the greatest .
it' s some sports clothes wholesaler .
he' s got nike and champion .
is it somewhere in town ?
there are more coming .
what' s he doing in here ?
i didn' t know he fancied chicks .
is it a homo show ?
what the hell ?
what a couple of jerks .
poofters .
that' s nasty .
hold on .
what is it ?
quiet .
you' re so gross .
get him out .
what a stinker .
hold on .
i need to take a piss .
christ , you' re so gross .
come on .
hi there .
you fucking bastard !
god damn it .
take it easy .
do we just kill each other and leave ?
come on .
nice , andy .
i like the way you parry with your nose .
seriously , take it easy .
are you okay ?
sure .
i' il go take a shower .
remember when i ko' d tyson ?
gurra enters .
the audience is expectant .
tyson has never been this scared .
and i move forward and smack . . .
your money , swedish pig .
give it up or i' il fuck you .
and your mum .
you got lucky .
the next time i' il cut your throat .
hi .
hi .
always with your left hand !
you got that , boy ?
is that brunette coming ?
are you horny ?
what brunette ?
the one with the nice rack .
where' s andy ?
at home changing his diaper .
yes !
i' d love to smash that fuck .
no , stay away from them .
it' s good they' re here .
the nazis are coming .
we don' t need their help .
it' s a shame andy isn' t here .
i heard he was on his way .
the rescue " .
so , where do you live now ?
skip it , you sodding poofter .
mike , look at that .
get him !
look at that .
your prince has arrived .
she' s just waiting for you to hook up with her .
you have no sense of humour .
you think you' re eddie murchy ?
his name is eddie murphy .
i know that .
i won' t see you again .
hi .
how are you doing ?
i' m fine .
it' s real good to see you .
you too .
would you like to dance ?
i haven' t got the time .
besides , this is a shitty dance floor .
did you see the jacuzzi upstairs ?
no .
you have to go see it .
it' s so cool .
she can wait here .
come on .
there' s no jacuzzi in here .
no , there isn' t .
well , what do you know ?
just a small , dirty couch .
come on over and sit down .
come on .
thank you .
for that thing in the subway ?
that was nothing .
those damned skinheads .
they got a thrashing .
you were so brave .
you were .
things like that happen .
the main thing is that we' re unscathed .
we really were lucky .
it could have been us down there .
i wonder what happened to the guy that was hit ?
disgusting .
yes .
we' il catch him downstairs .
you' re just lying here having it off .

i' m sorry .
that' s not what i meant .
i trust you .

his body was found on a busy street in downtown stockholm .
the investigation has been stopped due to a lack of resources .
what a load of crap .
what kind of dickhead comes up with this ?
he wasn' t in any bloody gang .
i can' t believe it .
jocke , the deputy headmaster has fondled petra .
it was so disgusting .
he forced me into a broom cupboard .
hi there .
petra , come on and let' s sort this out .
no .
sort what out ?
this is beyond you .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
i' ve waited for this a long time .
now you' re in serious trouble .
