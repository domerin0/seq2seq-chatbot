everyone in here is going to
hang it up , she' s just playing with you
you' re only making it worse
you shut the hell up
don' t pull the trigger , she blocked the barrell .
it' il backfire
i told you to shut up
can' t see
i can' t see
i can' t hear anything
for god sake , miho , finish him
yeah
make it quick , will you
she doesn' t quite chop his head off
she makes a pez dispenser out of him
then it' s straight to business stretching the corpses on the alley floor and checking their pockets digging up cash when they find it
i' m fishing around in jackie boy' s pants .
his wallet is packed
master card , discover , platinum american express
and nearly 300 bucks worth of 20s that i' m not too proud to stuff into my own pockets
then i find an atom bomb
jackie boy .
you son of a bitch
there was a helicopter that kicked up such a racket i couldn' t quite make out what she said
i thought shellie said " stop
she said " cop
detective lieutenant jack rafferty
iron jack " , the papers call him
a goddamn hero cop
it' s hell for years , the shaky truce
the cops get a slice of the profits and free entertainment when they throw a party
the girls get to administer their own brand of justice
they get to defend their own turf
if a cop blunders into the neighborhood and he' s not shopping for what the girls are selling
they send him packing
but they send him back alive
that' s the rules
that' s the truce
the cops stay out
that keeps the girls free to keep the pimps and the mob out
old town will be left wide open
it' il be war
the streets will run red with blood women' s blood
the cops
the mob .
things are going to go back to the way they used to be
the hell they will
we got guns
we' il fight the cops and the and mob and anybody else who tries to move in on us
we' il go to war
don' t be stupid , gail .
you wouldn' t stand a chance
get me a car
make sure it' s a hard top with a decent engine
i' il hide the bodies
did you forget that cop car that trailed them here ?
the cops know rafferty came here
they' il check the river , they' il check the sewer
they' il find him and come gunning for us
i' il hall the bodies to the pits .
the cops won' t check the pits .
get that gun out of my face or i' il smack you
who do you think you are , giving orders ?
you got what you wanted out of us shut up , gail
you got what you wanted out of me
and you were gone , off playing with that barmaid .
gone until you brought this unholy mess on us
miho moves to my back
1 word from gail and she' il cut me in half
they' il be watching the roads
they' il catch you
it' il be the bad old days , all over again
the pimps , the beatings , the drugs , the raps
they won' t be watching the roads , not yet , they won' t .
get me a damn hard top
if i don' t make it , you can have your war
get that gun out of my face , now
bastard !
i forgot how quick you are
my warrior woman
she almost yanks my head clean off
shoving my mouth into hers , it hurts
an explosion that blasts away the dull gray years between the now and that 1 firey night when she was mine
a hard top , with a decent engine , and make sure it' s got a big trunk
i' il always love you , baby
always
and never
where' d you find that heap ?
just look at that trunk
we' il never fit them all in gail ?
unless there' s something else you want me to do , do you think maybe i could go home ?
all this blood and stuff' s got me feeling like maybe i got to hurl
sure , becky , go home .
but don' t you talk to anybody
not even your mom
they' il never fit in that trunk
not like this , they won' t
miho ?
dry your hair as soon as you get home
you' il catch cold if you don' t
yeesh
hey , becky .
gail said no calls
i just want to hear my mom' s voice .
i won' t tell her nothing
please , don' t say nothing to gail
hey , mama ?
dizzy dames
what were they thinking sticking me up with a bucket of bolts like this ?
we were barely able to get the trunk to stay closed as it was , we packed it so tight
there wasn' t anything we could do but pile jackie boy in right next to me
now where anybody who cares to look will see him
go ahead .
take 1 of his cigarettes
it' il help
it' s got you smoking there , bud
you shut the hell up , jackie boy
you' re dead
i' m just imagining this , so shut the hell up
that tells you something about your state of mind , don' t it
it' s got you hearing things .
it' s got your nerves shot
it' s got you smoking
you know it' s true ...
nobody ever really quits
a smoker' s a smoker when the chips are down
and your chips are down ... much i' m fine , you shut the hell up
will you look at that
those hookers let you down
what are you going to do when you run out of gas ?
call triple a ?
you sucker for the babes
you ain' t even going to make it to the pits
you shut the hell up .
i' il make it
not unless you keep your eyes on the road , sugar pie
watch it !
ah , this is great .
just like being in a body movie
shut up !
oh , you' re screwed
it' s over .
you' re flushed
this time i can' t bring myself to tell him to shut up
sure he' s an asshole .
sure he' s dead
sure that i' m just imagining that he' s talking
none of that stops the bastard from being absolutely right
i don' t have a chance in hell of outrunning this cop
not in this heap
pull over !
the only question left is whether i' m going to kill him or not
tough call
for all i know , he' s an honest cop , regular guy working stiff with a mortgage , a wife , and a pile of kids
my hand moves on its own , sliding 1 of my guns to my lap and thumbing back the hammer
i don' t know what to do
you better stop .
you' re making him mad
whatever you say
you' re friend here .
party a little too hard tonight ?
i' m the designated driver
well , you' re driving with a busted tail light
i' il let you off with a warning
what next ?
the tank goes dry a quarter mile from the pits
i shove the t bird the rest of the way
a few minutes more work and it' il all be over
jackie boy will go into the damn tar pits
i' il catch a train out of sacred oaks
go home and call it a ...
no more questions , dallas .
do what i say .
clear the streets
we' re on lockdown .
we' re not selling any tail in old town
not tonight
don' t struggle .
you' il only hurt yourself
your cause is lost
we know everything
soon the corpse of detective rafferty will be in our possession
and the truce between your prostitutes and the police will be shattered
there' il be arrests .
there' il be deaths
my employer will sieze what remains of this neighborhood
you will all be slaves .
nothing can stop this
but it is within your power to save many lives by facilitating the process of transition by negotiating the terms of the surrender of old town
son of a bitch .
i knew you ...
i have suffered your kind before
the dregs of sin city .
i serve a new master now
and soon , you and all your retched kind will serve him as well
now get dressed and shed a tear for dwight mccarthy if you must because by now , he is surely dead
you don' t know him
my man will find a way
he always finds a way
i find these americans always whine and going on about how they got it so bad
this is a fine , grand country .
guiding light of the modern world , it is
low taxes , land of of opportunity
where else would 1 bullet boy' s defortune that we' re getting for this
sure beats a living hell out of blowing off airports and churches without shit to show for it
yeesh
you find something , murphy ?
look to be our poor dead cop' s badge
it' s all bent up
bent and stock in it
oh , bloody he ...
it' s the bullet
you son of a bitch !
bastard !
they weren' t cops , these 4
they were mercenaries
and if they were hired by who i think they were , the bad times haven' t even started yet
and everything seemed to be going so well
remember , we don' t have to deliver every last inch of the man , brian
you got a good point there , ronnie
hand me a knife
should take a nap while i' m doing all this waiting
i' m at the bone , alright ?
here we go
have you ever seen anything so pretty in your whole life ?
we' re a back to 3 of you .
and if anyone happens by , use your imagination .
ok ?
silence now
no air to breath
only the horrid oily tar taste creeping up my nostrils
let it in .
let it fill your lungs
they were counting on you , and you blew it
skinny , stealy fingers at my wrist
miho , you' re an angel .
you' re a saint
you' re mother theresa .
you' re elvis
you' re a god
and if you' ve shown up 10 minutes earlier , we' d still have jackie boy' s head
dwight , they got gail
it' s a sinch .
you got yourself a spy in old town
a stooly who sold you out to the mob
we got to find out who it is and rescue gail
but first we got to get our hands on jackie boy' s head before it gets to wherever it' s going and then this whole situation blows wide open
miho .
i hope to hell you left 1 of them alive enough to talk
i let him know i' m not fooling around
we talk
stay smart , stay cool
it' s time to prove to your friends that you' re worth a damn
sometimes that means dying
sometimes it means killing a whole lot of people
there they are .
what do we do ?
we stop them , dallas
jackie boy' s head so close to me , i could almost reach out and grab it right then and there
get the head , get the head
i got it , i got it
suck on this , you stupid slag
i can' t tell if miho is alive or dead but i' m on my feet and every ounce of me wants to get some killing done
want the head now , sweetheart .
so come down and get it !
brave lad
i could' ve put a bullet straight down your ear just now if i haven' t gotten my revolver all wet and useless you got the drop on my , love
i' m as helpless as a baby
better come clean with you , sweetheart
it was an old trade lie i was giving you about my revolver being wet
you see , i' m not too fond of shooting
it' s my preference to blow things off
i should blast the roof off a pulp
i' ve seen all the parts flying off people
little bang bang' s never going to match the size of that
and here' s me with all these fine grenades , such a sweet beauty of a remote
but it' s my knife i' il be doing you with
you killed my mates
someone should' ve told you
never give an irishman a good cause for revenge
deadly little miho
you won' t feel a thing unless she wants you to
she twists the blade
he feels it
i tell miho what we' re going to do and how we' re going to do it
i grab poor dallas' s car phone and make the most important call of my life
first we got to rescue gail
then comes the kill
the big fat kill
you just going to stand there and watch this ?
you kidding me man ?
like watching old manute do his thing all night long , and not get tired of it .
i mean , the man' s an artist
only an artist should be allowed to touch such a beautiful subject
your skin is perfect
your nerves ... responsive
beautiful
just give them what they want , gail
becky ?
it' s over , gail .
there' s no fighting them
dwight' s dead .
they got' s what' s left of that cop we killed
the mob' s going to turn it over to the police chief , the cops are going to mow us down .
we got to cut a deal
you little bitch .
you sold us out
i didn' t have no choice
they was going to hurt my mom
it selfish , you holding out like this .
you' re going to get a lot of girls killed for no good reason
it wasn' t your mom .
we could' ve protected her , and you know it
it was the money , you stupid little bitch
sure there is money .
sure you could' ve moved my mom into old town and let her know that her own goddamn daughter is a whore
break' s your heart doesn' t it
they offered me what you couldn' t never offer me
i had to watch out for my own neck
you' re neck .
you' re precious , scrawny , little neck
you' re crazy .
you could' ve ripped my throat out , you crazy whore
schutz , fetch my blades
stuka , kill this one
no , i was promised
stupid little bitch .
you deserve worse
i knew there was a reason i got out of bed this morning
hey ... hey
nobody , i don' t see nobody
could we look at that ?
it' s right through me .
guys , look
there' s somethign wrapped around it
some kind of note
give it to me
the fuck we' re doing ?
out back , everyone , and bring the women
you think , somebody should call me a doctor or something ?
mccarthy , you fool
hey .
guys ?
ohh
dozens of them
armed to the teeth
i' m outnumbered , outgunned
but the alley is crooked , dark , and very narrow
they can' t surround me
sometimes you can beat the odds with a careful choice of where to fight
you can have old town .
i don' t care .
just give me the woman
shut up
dwight .
don' t do this
hey , wait a minute .
something' s not right
shut up .
or i' il plug you
of course , mr. mccarthy .
a fair trade .
she' s all yours
now if you' il explain why we shouldn' t blow both of you to pieces
dwight , what have you done ?
exactly what i had to ... every step of the way
no , it isn' t right .
there wasn' t no tape over his mouth .
how come there' s tape over his mouth
where the fight counts for a lot
you trick , mccarthy , but it will do you no good
but there' s nothing like having your friends show up with lots of guns
no , mccarthy , you shan' t !
the girls all know the score
no escape
no surrender
no mercy
we got to kill every last rat bastard one of them
every last one
not for revenge .
not because they deserve it . not because it' il make the world a better place
we need a heap of bloody bodies so when mob boss , wallenquist , looks over his charts of profits and losses , he' il see what it cost him to mess with the girls of old town
the valkyrie at my side is shouting and laughing with the pure hate for blood thirsty joy of the slaughter
and so am i
the fire , baby .
it' il burn us both
there' s no place in this world for our kind of fire
my warrior woman .
my valkyrie
you' il always be mine .
always .
and never
that yellow bastard
evening officer
i don' t ... have to introduce myself , do i ?
you read the papers ?
this being an election year , you' ve seen plenty of my picture
you know who i am and what i can do
i' m doing you , hartigan
cold and hard , i' m doing you
you blew my son' s ear off
blew his arm off , you even blew his nuts and his pecker off
he' s in a coma right now , they say he may never come out of it
my boy .
he could' ve been the first rourk to become the president of the united states , but you had turned him into a brain damaged dickless freak
pulling that trigger make you feel powerful ?
power don' t come from a badge , or a gun
power comes from lying
lying big and getting the whole damn world to play along with you
once you got everybody agreeing with what they know in their hearts ain' t true , you get them by the balls
there' s what , maybe 500 people in this hospital
i could pump you full of bullets right now and i wouldn' t be arrested
everyone would lie for me , everyone who counts
otherwise all their own lies , everything that runs sin city , it all comes tumbling down like a pack of cards
but i want you firm , fit , and healthy
i' m even putting up cash of my own to get you more surgery .
fix that ... heart condition of yours
you' re going to keep living a long time , i' m going to make sure of that
you' re going to be convicted of raping that little brat
and shooting my boy
your wife .
you tell her the truth , and she' s dead
you tell anybody the truth , and they' re dead
they won' t let testify
i told the cops that you saved my life and they just like i was crazy
they talked my parents into keeping me away
they said that you done things that you didn' t do
i told them that you saved me from that rourk creep
but they won' t even check me out to see if i' m still a virgin
still a virgin , still alive
thanks to you
they got it all backwards
sometimes the truth doesn' t matter like it ought
but you' il always remember things , right ?
that' s going to mean a lot to me
stay away , nancy
they' il kill you if you don' t stay away
don' t visit me , don' t write me , don' t even say my name
if you won' t let me visit , but i' il still write to you , hartigan
i' il sign my letters " cordelia
it' s a name of a really cool detective in books i read
i' il write to you every week
for forever
sure kid
now run on home
it' s not safe for you hear
bye , nancy
i love you
john hartigan
mr. " law and order
mr. " by the book
mr. high and mighty
i got to give you credit .
being such a straight arrow for so damn many years without it catching up with you
it' s catching up with you now , friend of mine
it' s catching up with you but good
maybe i had a look at him .
he doesn' t look too good
he' s hailing hard , tammy .
see ?
he' s a picture of hell
that tammy there .
she' s fine , isn' t she ?
i rented her out of old town
i want to show you what you won' t be getting of
not in prison
you hear me , hartigan ?
you stop being stupid
start playing along with us , you just might get some of tammy
you see that ?
she flinched
you make her sick
she heard about you and that little girl
this is nothing but a price i promised myself i' d pay , and i' m paying it
you don' t save a little girl' s life , and turn around and throw her to the dogs
not in my book , you don' t
they want a confession .
they won' t get i
there' s a letter from nancy when they put me in solitary
she calls herself " cordelia
she makes no mention of anything that would give her away
at first i figure she' il send another note or 2 before her young mind moves on to better things
but every thursday , another 1 arrives
what a sweet kid
i do my best to keep my hand from shaking when i reach for it
she' s the only friend i got
the daughter i never had
my sweet cordelia
skinny little nancy callahan
8 years pass
then comes a thursday when i bound from my cot , excited as a kid at christmas
only to find myself staring at the damn floor of my damn cell
looking for a letter from nancy that isn' t there
then another thursday with no letter
is she alright ?
did something happen to her ?
nothing
2 months now .
not a word from nancy
did they find her ?
did they get to her ?
of course .
stupid old man
do your math .
nancy' s 19 years old .
how long did you expect her to keep writing ?
she was a saint to give it up as long as she did
she' s forgotten you , old man
you' re alone .
you' re all alone
this guy smells awful , like bad food
like a corpse left in a garbage dumpster in the middle of summer
he stinks so bad , i want to throw up
practically knocked my head off , the bastard
when i come to , i see it
the same kind of envelope nancy always uses
but there' s no letter inside of it
something soft .
something that ought to be alive
a hunk of meat and bone that ought to be the index finger of the right hand of a 19 year old girl
how the hell did they find her ?
she was so careful .
she never gave away where she lives or where she works
i' ve got to get out .
i' ve got to help .
nothing else matters
not my life , and not my pride either
it' s only 1 final surrender they want
you got me rourk , you beat me
i say everything they want to hear , just the way they want to hear it
i tell them i' m a twisted , retched child molester
i agree to everything they want from me
i love you , nancy
it' s a lot of miles into town , hartigan
you care for a ride ?
as long as you stay in front of me
prison' s made you paranoid
talk about water under the bridge .
christ
8 years
yeah , 8 years
well , if it' s any consolation for you ...
you made me hate myself
any word from aileen ?
yeah .
she got remarried ... 4 years ago
she had 2 kids
i' m sorry , john
don' t be
i' m glad
aileen always wanted kids
she' il make a good mother
like you said , bob .
water under the bridge
bob and i get along with our fond farewells to eachother
and i go looking for the only human being on the planet that means a damn to me
nancy
how could they have found out it was you writing all those letters to me
how did they find out who you are ?
and what have they dont to you , baby ?
not a sound
no sign of life
has rourk gone through all this trouble to torture an old man ?
like a kid poking at fly when he' s already torn its wings off ?
what has he done to nancy ?
it' s like all she does is read and study and write
no diary .
no phone numbers or addresses written down anywhere
closest thing to a clue is a pack of matches from a louzy salloon
it' s a long shot , but maybe she' s got some friends there
a dead end
nancy wouldn' t have anything to do with a pack of drunks and losers like this
but if there' s anything to be found here , the faintest lead to wherever nancy is or whoever kidnapped her or mutilated her this is the place
excuse me , miss .
i' m wondering if you could help me
i' m looking for somebody
well , a night like this , everybody' s looking for somebody , stranger
it' s not like that .
her name is nancy
eyes to the stage , pilgrim
she' s just warming up
skinny little nancy callahan
she grew up
she filled out
nancy callahan , 19 year old
and here i was expecting a skinny little bookworm maybe a bit too shy for her own good how little she told me about herself in all her letters for all those years
how the hell did they find her ?
then it hits me
they were bluffing
i' ve led them straight to her
she hasn' t spotted you yet
turn around and walk out the door
lead the creep outside
get that berretta away from him somehow , and kill him
i' m just a horny ex con watching an exotic dancer
just a few seconds and she' il be safe
no , nancy .
don' t notice me
don' t recognize me
there' s no time to explain .
i' ve made a terrible mistake
i put you in terrible danger .
we need to get out of here .
right this second
whatever you say , hartigan .
let me throw some clothes on
and here i' d figured you' d forget all abotu me .
me and my dumb letters
kept me going
kept me from killing myself
hurry up , will you ?
maybe i should drive not a chance
nobody but me can keep this heap running
besides from the sounds of things , you might have to shoot somebody
i don' t have a gun
under the seat
it' s loaded and it works
this' il do
taken it to the range a couple times
kicks like a mule
hartigan ?
there' s so much i' ve wanted to say to you .
you never go far from my thoughts
i' ve lain awake nights , thinking of you
what are you talking about ?
keep driving , nancy .
keep driving and keep the car on the road
she' s counting on you , old man
what are you doing ?
prove you' re still worth a damn
try to keep it on the road , nancy
he' s a decent shot
but he' s in too much of a hurry
throwing away bullets like they were candy
he doesn' t know how to take his time
aim carefull and look the devil in the eye
stop the car , nancy .
i' ve got to confirm the kill
what ?
stop the car , now !
right .
stop the car .
confirm the kill
sorry , i got a little rattled
it' s ok .
you did great .
sit tight .
i' il be right back
no .
let me stay close
nothing can happen to me when i' m with you
please ?
let me stay close ?
the stink .
i almost gag
his blood smells even worse than he does
and it' s all over the place
but the creep , himself ... he' s gone
we' re out of time
sirens .
i used to welcome the sound
there' s nothing to do now but find a place to huddle up for the night
get nancy to calm down and figure out what on earth i' m going to do next
the stink .
somehow it stays with us all the way to the hotel
nancy , i went to your apartment .
your windows thrown wide open
the rooms looks almost empty .
that' s why i' m sure you' d been kidnapped
my window ?
robbed again ?
that' s the 3rd time this year
i swore if i ever saw you again , i' d show you i grew up strong
there i was just like before , scared and helpless
i' m such an asshole you should sit down .
you' il feel a little bit better if you sit down
i' ve never been all that good with people
when it comes to reassuring a traumatized 19 year old ...
i' m as expert as a paulsy victim doing brain surgery with a pipe wrench
it' s always been you , hartigan
all these years
it' s just nerves making you say that
i' m just exhausted .
i need to sleep
sleep with me stop it , nancy
8 years .
why do you think i kept writing you those letters
it wasn' t just gratitude
i tried to fall in love with boys
i thought i did once or twice
but i was already in love ... with you
that' s enough .
jesus christ .
i' m old enough to be your grandfather
you' re just scared i' m not scared
no
there' s wrong and there' s wrong and then there' s this
for god' s sakes , you' re just a kid
i love you
i love you , too with all my heart
cold shower .
it helps
no , nancy
recognize my voice , hartigan ?
recognize my voice , you piece of shit cop ?
i look different , but i bet you can recognize my voice
sure , i recognize your voice , junior
everything' s going straight to hell
i' ve been suckered into betraying the only friend i got
and put her in the hands of a murdering rapist i thought i put down for good
suckered by a spoiled brat , son of a senator
it' s all gone to hell
klump .
it' s me
i got a dead man needs to be fetched
i want you to set me up for a party
i' ve already got the girl , you dumb shit
it better be perfect or i' m calling my dad
my tools better be clean and sharp
better be ready .
it better be perfect
i get to do whatever i want
however i want , whenever i want it
my dad .
i' d love him if i didn' t hate him
he spent a fortune hiring every expert on the planet to grow back that equipment you blew off from between my legs
just so the old fart can hold out some kind of hope of having a grandkid
although , as you can see , there were some ... side effects
i' m not complaining though .
since you' ve been gone , i' ve been having the time of my life
now you' ve led me back to your darling cordelia
we all wondered who wrote all those letters .
she left not a clue
clever girl .
so pretty , so pretty
little old for my taste , but i can forgive that just this once
nancy , don' t scream .
whatever he does to you , don' t scream
she' il scream .
i' m going to take all night doing dear old nancy .
and you' re going to die knowing it' s all your fault
they' ve all screamed , hartigan
dozens of them .
maybe a hundred 8 years worth .
every one of them screamed
and if there weren' t so many people hear about , i would show you how to make dear old nancy scream
it' s going to be 1 hell of a show
this is it .
no way to fight it now
no hope left
no chance
this is it
this is the end
no
give it a shot , old man .
keep your neck tight
move .
the window .
maybe there' s an alarm
the window .
keep your neck tight , god dammit .
stay conscious
stay conscious
no alarm
the glass .
cut the rope .
you can do it
you can do it
it is inclement upon me to comment with mark displeasure on your rash impulsiveness in selecting such an eye catching and impracticle car to heist , mr. shlubb
irrelevent to said mission , is the following queary which i now put forth to you
where in this most streamlined and trunkless of transports , boner inspiring though it may be , where in , are we to reposit our recently deceased cargo ?
i can only express puzzlement that borders on alarm
show me where roark takes the girls , or i' il cut your damn head off
in plain english , creep
he had to
even agrarian ...
the farm
that' s all i need to hear
every cop on the force knows about the roark family' s farm and to stay away from it
shlubb and klump were packing an arsenal
once things get loud , i' il probably have use for the cannons
but at first , i' il have to play it quiet
quiet and nasty
nancy' s car .
6 miles from the farm
nobody but me can keep this heap running " she told me
good girl
the car stalled out on that yellow bastard you kept your mouth shut .
i' il bet junior was serious
i bet he slapped you around something fierce
but you stayed strong .
you bought a few extra minutes
there' s still a chance , nancy
don' t scream
i ditch the car a mile or so from the farm and make my way through the woods
i' m not half way there when it hits
my heart
it can' t be my heart .
i was cured
bad cough
blood in it .
doesn' t matter now
i don' t have to stay alive that much longer anyway
rotten way to kill a man
but it' s quiet
hate yourself later
you' re only making it worse for yourself , you stupid cow !
don' t you think i' m tired ?
is that it ?
you think i' m getting tired ?
you' re the one who' s going to crack .
you' il crack !
you' il cry and beg
you' il scream
oh yeah , you' il scream , you big fat ugly cow .
you' il scream
you thinking the whip is the best i could do ?
that was foreplay
hartigan was right about you .
you can' t get it up unless i scream
you' re pathetic pathetic
that' s not wise at all to make fun of me like that
it brings out the worst in me
stupid old man
in too much of a hurry
damn .
it can' t be !
charging in like gallahad , just like i told myself i wouldn' t
stupid old man
attacked him good don' t take no chances .
perferate the fool
good advice
give it up , junior
it' s over .
let her go
you' re dreaming hartigan
i get to see your eyes while i fillet the woman of your dreams right in front of you
look at you .
you' re about to keel over , you can' t even lift that cannon
sure i can
you gave me the scare there for a second , old man
nancy , i' m sorry
i' m taking no chances with you
first i soften you up , and then it' s showtime
here it comes
it' s going to hurt
you' re right about that
sucker
i take away his weapon
both of them
after awhile , all i' m doing is pounding wet chunks of bone into the floor boards
so i stop
so long , junior
been a pleasure
i didn' t scream , hartigan
not once
i didn' t scream
i know it , baby
you grew up strong
by the time i get her to the car , nancy stops shaking
her skin is warm again
she' s herself again
thanks for remembering my coat
and for all the little things
like saving my life ... twice
you better get rolling
you' re not coming along ?
no .
i have friends on their way
to collect evidence .
i' m going to blow this whole sick mess wide open
i' m going to clear my name .
i' m going to put senator roark behind bars , where he belongs
can' t lose you .
not again
you' il never lose me , nancy
nancy callahan .
the love of my life
shame to lie to her .
i hope she forgives me for it
get senator roark behind bars ?
sure .
and maybe after i' ve pulled off that miracle , i' il go and punch out god
there isn' t a prosecutor in the state who' il go after senator roark
i killed his only son .
the bloodline is cut
roark' s lost his goddamn legacy
he' il use all his power to get revenge on me
he' il go after me through nancy
he' il find her again .
there' il be no end to it
she' il never be safe .
not as long as i' m alive
there' s only one way to beat him
and old man dies .
a young woman lives
fair trade
i love you , nancy
uh huh ... yes
oh mom .
don' t go on like that
it' s not the city .
i could' ve gotten in a car accident anywhere
yeah , just a fracture
the doctor said , it' s a clean break .
should be right as rain in no time
uh huh
turn the right corner in sin city and you can find ... anything
becky ?

i love you too , mom
anything
