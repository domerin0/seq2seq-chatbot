she' s still missing .
excuse me while you guys catch up , okay ?
don' t go too far , thelma .
we' il be letting these nice gentlemen out in 30 seconds .
sounds like you got yourself an open and shut there , paulie .
i don' t think so .
a man worth several hundred million dollars ... found dead with his wife' s wedding band on his mutilated hand .
what' s that tell you ?
the doer is saying he' s got her .
he' s probably contacting the family right now , making a ransom demand .
i' d have been paged if he had .
check your batteries .
it' s defiinitely a ransom .
excuse me .
mr. rhyme , kenneth solomon .

so what do we got , paulie ?
we have footprints , size ten , thanks to officer donaghy ... using a dollarbill to establish scale .
we have asbestos on a track bed where there shouldn' t be any .
an iron bolt holding down a , uh , piece of paper .
a book page with 1 1 9 written on it .
decaying oxidation on the bolt' s head but not on the thread , which says to me thatsomeone removed it from somewhere else ... and placed it there recently .
wouldn' t you agree , officer ?

forensics is not my area .
i disagree with you .
you can' t force me to take this assignment .
i can .
and if i refuse ?
i would say that you' re putting your career at serious risk .
you think because of your condition you have the right to push people around ?
i' m sorry .
that is truly pathetic .
truly ?
you' re damn right , truly .
well , forgive me , truly , if i insist on having someone with your brains and a fresh pair of eyes .

i' m all over this thing now .
okay , we' re talking , uh , pearly looking .
some kind of a ... shellfish or something .
oyster shells maybe ?
could be .
definitely .
if i had to bet on it , i' d say it was .
sure .
allright , i got it .
the oldest asbestos sites are coming up .
in 1913 when the woolworth building was being built , workmen found the body of this rich industrialist , talbot soames .
he' d been kidnapped the year before , shot in the head and buried .
and what they thought was white sand turned out to be oyster ... shells .
crushed oyster shells .
that' s what they used as landfill in lower manhattan .
that' s how pearl street got its name .
that' s where mrs. rubin' s gonna be .
somewhere downtown .
she' s gonna be underground .
she' s gonna be in a basement ... near ... or in the woolworth building .
hey , paulie .
call emergency services unit .
have them meet us down by the woolworth building .
tell them to start their search .
maybe we' il get lucky .
okay ?
eddie .
did you bring your van ?
yeah .
uh , it' s downstairs .
we' re gonna need it .
throw your keys to amelia .
paulie , you and solomon go with her .
shouldn' t i go with them ?
no, you gotta stay here with me .
we gotta work that bolt .
that' s the missing piece .
shall we keep cheney in the loop ?
fuck him .
fuck him .
amelia .
trust me .
follow those instincts you were born with .
i' il be with you ... every step of the way .
jesus , 25 minutes left .
how did rhyme get to be that way ?
he was born brilliant .
it happens .
i mean the physical part .
about four years ago , he was working the body of a transit cop ... been found shot in a subway tunnel .
beam came down , damn near cut him in half .
jesus .
family ?
married sister in phoenix .
he never sees her .
cut himself off .
technically , he' s still on active duty , collecting full pay .
p. b. a. insurance picks up round the clock care and all the gadgets .
on weekends , always one or two cops there lending a hand .
tough deal winding up like that .
you won' t hear him complaining .
nah , he gets too much pleasure pushing other people' s buttons .
in your case , i' d be complimented .
you gotta learn to relax around a compliment , especially one from rhyme .
you can be a little grating .
me ?
kiddo , if you were any more wound up , you' d be a timex .
he was a human dynamo writing books ,
lecturing all over the world , giving expert opinion in trials , working half the crime scenes in the city .
you know what he' d do in his downtime ?
i can' t imagine .
he' d collect things dirt , metals , plastics , hubcaps , plants , musical strings , medical tools , anything you could think of .
obsessive .
no , he' d have it all analyzed and catalogued ... for his what cha call it database .
jesus christ !
i' d like to get there in one piece , if possible .
new york security gate company .
start looking through those ?
that might be good .
what else ?
nicholas steven gerard .
elevator construction .
gotta be underground .
i got a subway builder .
sounds
excuse me !
n. s. g. niagra steam generation .
bought by eastern gas and electric in 1 928 .
the six inch iron bolt was used mainly for steam pipe assemblies .
no .
no .
349, you got 11 minutes left .
where are you ?
we just hit the financial district .
there' s a steam junction ... with big asbestos coated pipes .
that' s where our victim' s gonna be .
i' d bet my legs on it .
she' s gonna be at wall and nassau .
wall and nassau .
has e. s. u. been notifiied ?
they' re on their way .
they' il probably get there before you .
e. s. u. says that steam is released through that junction every day at 4 : 00 p . m .
shit , what' s this asshole up to ?
i don' t know , but it' s gonna happen in about ten minutes and thirty seconds .
all right , linc , we' re here .
we' re going down there .
amelia ?
yeah , i' m here .
it' s their job to try and save mrs. rubin' s life .
it' s your job to get ready and ... work the crimescene , if necessary .
there' s some things you' re gonna need .
look in the back of the truck , and you' il see an aluminium suitcase and a radio headset .
see it ?
yeah , i see them .
there must be a way in .
what' s the problem here ?
fuckin ' valves freeze up easy .
come on , guys .
shut it off .
you there ?
i' m here .
i' m inside the pipe .
go !
i hear something !
i hear something !
what is that ?
someone' s in there !
i can hear her crying .
everyone , quiet now !
shut all the valves down .
mrs. rubin ?
mrs. rubin ?
she' s in there , linc .
mrs. rubin , we' re on our way in now !
come on , guys .
let' s go , let' s go .
let' s hurry the fuck up .
get drill and a tap .
somebody cut this thing halfway through .
there' s no way to turn that steam off , guys .
back !
back !
paulie ?
paulie ?
linc , she' s gone .
the whole place is scalded in steam .
let' s go !
this way !
let' s go !
this way ! ... is in some way e. s. u. are gonna blow a hole in the subbasement wall .
there' s no other way in .
it' s my understanding ...
i' m working with chief murphy' s authorization on this , right ?
yeah , that' s right .
i don' t want those emergency services guys rushing in there , trampling the evidence before we get a chance to run the scene .
what do you want ?
when they blow the hole , i want donaghy to go in first .
hey , come on , linc .
she' s not trained for this .
we could get our asses in a sling .
my ass has been in a sling for four years .
tell hanson and his beasts that' s what i want .
period .
allright .
you got it .
okay , let' s move !
all the pipes in the junction have been secured .
right .
check all the way to broadway .
i' m doing this under protest , sellitto .
the perp could still be in there , for christ' s sake .
rhyme' s in charge , and they' re his orders .
you can' t handle it in there , i want you to get your ass out .
amelia , you ready ?
yeah .
listen to me .
i' m with you every step of the way .
go on .
good luck .
i' m in .
tell me what you see .
everything' s been boiled to hell .
oh , god .
what is it ?
it' s an awful smell .
that means you' re close .
i can' t believe i' m doing this .
you' re fine .
just fine .
you' re doing great .
now just remember the academy .
when you walk , move in a straight line .
we don' t want to disturb any footprints he might ' ve left .
yeah , assuming he' s gone .
there' s no footprints .
there' s nothing yet .
oh , god .
what ?
talk to me .
talk to me , amelia .
i can see her .
the steam pipe was opened , and she' s tied down right in front of it .
okay .
there' s nothing you can do about that now .
you can' t do anything for her but help her by ... working the crime scene ; that' s your job .
open your suitcase .
get your camera .
i can' t do this .
you can do it .
yes , you can .
yesterday you stopped a train .
you can do anything you want when you put your mind to it .
don' t work me , rhyme .
just tell me what to do next .
very slowly , walk the grid ... one foot in front of the other .
i want you to look around you now .
remember , crime scenes are three dimensional .
floors , wall sand ceilings .
rhyme .
yeah , i' m here .
there' s something strange .
things he left for us ?
yes .

there' s a small piece of wood ... and , uh , looks like some hair .

it' s a bloody bone .
where is it ?
it' s in my fucking hand .
human ?
i think so , yeah .

photograph it .
bag it .
okay , that' s it .
i' m outta here .
one more thing .
we gotta process the body .
wha i' m not a medical examiner .
i can' t do that .
i' m not asking you to do an autopsy .
i just want you to
just describe the restraints .
okay .
they' re strange looking handcuffs .
they look more like old shackles or something .
there' s a chain , uh , across her waist .
and her feet are , uh , are bound with a rope .
hands above her head ?
yeah .
there' s also a large , uh , a piece of flesh ... missing from her right forearm .
it' s right down to the bone .
it looks like it was surgically removed .
this is what i want you to do .
we' re gonna need those handcuffs , amelia .
it' s probably our best chance for good prints .
the m. e. can remove them when they get here .
m. e. is all thumbs .
they' re
they' il mess up the prints .
look in the suitcase .
there' s a small saw .
okay .
i want you to saw her hands off at the wrist line .
we gotta have those cuffs for prints .

your phone' s down .
he was concerned .
my phone' s fine .
i don' t need his concern .
he needs you over to his place right away .
well , i don' t work for lincoln rhyme .
rhyme believes the evidence you collected is telling him there' s another vic in play .
and he is laying that at my feet ?
hey .
don' t shoot the messenger .
you just move in ?
uh, yeah , about ayearago .
really ?
you were a model .
yeah , when i was a kid .
kid model to street cop .
there' s a leap .
for whatever it' s worth ,
i thought what you did today was pretty damn terrific .
hey , you guys , i' m outta here .
i' m gonna grab a cab .
i' ve got a paper to finish .
i' m just gonna hang .
no problem .
i' il be there in a minute .
can i finish that ?
go for it .
i' il see you outside .
taxi .
that bone' s definitely not human .
and the hair ?
not human either .
well , what is it ?
i' m workin ' fast as i can .
glad to see you could join us .
i got cheney on the line .
he wants you to brief him .
tell him i' il call him back .
first , you did a hell of a job locating the evidence .
there' s no question the perp knows forensics .
now , as for the other thing , the , uh you know , the victim' s hands , well , maybe , um maybe it was too much to handle , so we' il just forget it .
is that your version of an apology ?
an apology ?
is that why you came over here ?
you really are a piece of work .
well , aren' t we a pair .
i think you' re terrific .
you got a hell of an arrest record too .
high marks from all your bosses .
definite goldshield potential .
why do you want to throw it all away to chase youth offenders ?
i don' t feel i have any need to explain that to you .
come on , amelia , cop to cop .
cop to cop , let' s just leave it at personal reasons .
okay .
doesn' t have anything to do with your father , does it ?
man , you just keep charging at walls , don' t you ?
stubbornness is something we both share .
you know , they say , genetically speaking , that we come into this world with a preordained destiny .
i don' t believe it , though .
for example , my parents .
neither of them had more than an eighth grade education , never read more than one book between them , not one .
i' ve read thousands .
i' ve written a dozen .
what' s your point ?
my point ... is that destiny is what you make it .
whatever happened to your father doesn' t mean it' s gonna happen to you .
you' re a great cop .
you' il make a terrific detective .
it' s a gift .
don' t throw it away .
a report from the taxi commission .
an nyu student was abducted late last night .
his girlfriend saw him struggling to get out as the taxi driver ... was bludgeoning him with a flashlight .
no description of the driver .
okay , everybody , this could be our next victim .
yeah , tony .
paulie here .
it looks like we got another victim .
did you get a deadline off that evidence yet ?
not yet .
something i was hoping you' d help me with .
no !
no !
no !
anyone for some osso buco ?
what ?
the bone we found at the wall street scene veal shank .
braised and overly salted to boot .
a cow bone ?
uh huh .
and i also found a piece of that old paper ... embedded in the bone .
take a look .
what' s going on ?
just do what you need to do as quickly as possible .
this came in from the f. b. i. it' s about the hair follicles .
he says they' re not human .
a rodent , probably a rat .
get this they were shaved off .
now we' re looking for a rat that shaves .
i really like that .
i' ve known a few in my time .
how about you , amelia ?
more than a few .
it' s consistent with underground , that' s for sure , huh ?
what' s he trying to say to us ?
defiinitely communicating in our language .
leaving clues .
forensic clues , at that .
maybe it' s a cop .
maybe .
maybe he' s trying to share the responsibility of these murders with us .
if we don' t figure out the clues in time , the blood' s on our hands .
and if we don' t find the victim in time , we' re as responsible for the murders as he is .
what do you got on that dirt you scraped from the wood ?
i don' t have it 100 percent individuated , but it does appear nitrogen rich .
all set .
ready to rock and roll .
thanks for rushing , man .
allright , thelma .
thankyou , richard .
nitrogen rich .
explosive carbons .
where do you find those in new york ?
bomb sites .
shooting ranges .
maybe an old fort or an armory .
let' s not forget the shit factor , guys .
the what ?
manure becomes a nitrate when it' s aged .
that' s true .
and you got cow bones , huh ?
old cow bones , old manure .
turn of the century .
cows , farms , pastures , rats .
dead cows .
where do you find in stockyards .
slaughterhouses that' s what we wanna look for .
stockyards and slaughterhouses from turn of the century .
let' s start there .
check the internet .
okay , i want tax records , sanitation records ... and building code inspections , last hundred years , okay ?
your blood pressure is way up .
you' re pushing it too hard , rhyme .
i understand , thelma .
what do we got on the stockyards over there ?
almost there .
you okay ?
no , i' m not okay .
i can' t figure out this damn time line ... or these shards of cardboard .
i don' t know what the hell it means .
uh, yeah .
we got three defunct stockyard sites .
there' s one on the east side .
lexington and the harlem river viaduct .
good .
solomon , put the box down .
mark it down on the viewer as she calls them off .
your blood pressure' s gonna blow a gasket if you don' t slow down .
my body has a mind of its own .
it doesn' t listen to me , all right ?
what else , amelia ?
yeah , there' s another on the hudson up at 155th .
mark it down , solomon .
look , your stats are going down .
you saw him have a seizure the otherday .
what else ?
there' s one underground at greenwich and houston .
mark it down , solomon .
why don' t you knock it off , linc ?
i don' t need to knock it off !
wh what was the first one that you mentioned ?
lexington and the harlem river viaduct .
and when did it close ?
1910 .
okay , what about , uh houston and greenwich ?
when is that ?
uh , 1898 .
and hudson and 155th was closed in 1906 .
1906 , 1898
all right .
let' s 1898 .
houston and greenwich .
call emergency services , paulie .

amelia ?
yeah .
all right .

i want you in first .
let' s do it .
you watch yourself , amelia .
man , i don' t like this .
i don' t like this .
linc , i got a bad feeling about this , man .
i think all three of us ought to get in there together .
not yet , paulie .
just hold back .
i' m going down some stairs .
cement walls .
woodcrates .
large columns .
smells like manure down here .
ortiz sure knows hiss hit , huh ?
always has .
metal hooks ... and a pen .
it' s a slaughterhouse .
come on , guys .
go , go , go , go !
e. s. u. are here .
you hold ' em off .
don' t want ' em contaminating the scene .
hold it .
hold up , hold up !
you' re not to go in .
why ?

fuck him !
get me cheney on the line .
crimescene c. o. on air .
switch to channel 22 for e. s. u. fuck rhyme .
maybe this one' s still alive .
perp didn' t leave a deadline .
what does that mean ?
it means we' re probably too late .
you don' t know that , rhyme .
get off the line .
just move on , amelia .
you know , there' s five basic contaminants to every crime scene .
i' il skip to the worst one other cops .
i think i hear something .
i hate this shit .
i see something .
something' s there .
i think i found him .
i i can' t tell if he' s alive .
oh , geez .
he' s covered in rats .
they' re all over him .
we' re goin ' in .
no , you' re not .
no , you' re not !
go , go !
central , we have shots fired .
shots fired .
oh , god .
you were right .
we never had a shot .
he cut him up pretty bad and left him for the rats .
there' s also a big cut in his leg .
it' s right down to the bone .
the blood attracted the rats .
goddamn son of a bitch .
you okay ?
i' m fine .
you wanna step aside so i can walk the grid ?
yeah .
yeah .
all right .
let' s back ' em up .
let' s give her some room .

sounds like you' re starting to enjoy this work .
damn !
the press is here .

fuck murphy and fuck rhyme .
this has been cleared downtown .
we got a dead kid in there .
i , for one , am not taking the heat for that .
you understand , hmm ?
call ortiz .
tell him and his crew to vacate rhyme' s place now .
excuse me , but the victim was already dead when we arrived .
and you , half assed patrolman working a crime scene , those days are over .
i' il take that evidence bag now , thankyou .
you can take it with a chain of custody voucher , sir .
are you outta your mind ?
cheney says he wants all the evidence .
hmm ?
let' s go .
you' re coming with us .
what , are you arresting me ?
just get in the car and keep your mouth shut to the press .
you' re not gonna find any prints .
the guy' s too good for that .
well , it looks like we have a nice , clean friction print here .
unless , of course , it' s yours .
no .
i was wearing gloves when i collected it .
we' il know soon enough .
put this through , highest priority .
you got it .
thank you .
hey , you know , i got a feeling this perp' s been in business a long time .
yeah , i hear you , but that' s cheney' s problem now .
yeah , that' s what scares me .
do me a favor , will you ?
check and see if there' s been any homicides in the last 12 months ... involving surgically removed flesh exposing bone .
no problem .
i' il see you soon .
hope so , eddie .
hey , thelma ?
don' t you let him run no circles around you now .

the guy has three extremely violent priors .
oh , look at that .
taxi license , no less .
we got him .
let' s go , boys !
somebody call e. s. u.
now slide out nice and easy .
that explains your print , captain .
he' s now the fourth victim of a killing spree ...
that has prompted nypd brass to launch a taskforce ... to track the killer .
this morning' s raid follows leads found in one of the earlier murder sites .
hey !
hey .
i was hoping you' d show up .
he' s been worried about you . ... lincoln rhyme .
yeah , sure .
viewers will know rhyme from his book , scene of the crime , a chronicle of old new york' s most grisly murders hey .
i didn' t expect to see you again .
poor cheney , huh ?
grabbed the ball with both hands and scored one for the other team .
i can' t comment at this time yeah .
i tried to warn him that the perp was too smart to leave a print .
how you doin ' with that stuff ?
not too good .
two pieces of the puzzle , but i don' t know what it means .
maybe this' il help .
cheney will have your badge for that .
he wouldn' t give me a chain of custody voucher , so what could i do ?
you could bring it back to him .
the man is a living monument to ineptitude .
true .
let' s take a look .
what do you got there ?
ah !
third piece of the puzzle .
there' s something really strange about it .
you gotta smell it .
sure .
are you oh , shoot .
sorry .
it' s okay .
take your time .
okay .
you have to put it closer to my nose .
what do you think it is ?

he' s already finalized arrangements to self terminate .
he' s convinced some doctor friend to help ... with his " final transition , " as he calls it .
but suicide ?
i mean it' s the seizures .
any one of' em could put him into a vegetative state .
that' s what he fears more than anything .
who is it ?

mr. rhyme is asleep .

i need to see him now .
let me deal with this asshole cheney .

look , don' t " lady " me .
and i know my rights .

i have reason to believe there' s stolen evidence on these premises .
now , what' s your full name , hmm ?
thelma what ?
you want to get official , huh ?
what did you say your name was ?
allright .
i' m not here to play the name game , honey .

i' m gonna leave now , but i' il be back .
and when i come back , it' il be with a warrant .
i looked everywhere , and i thought the conductor was gonna be so angry .
i kept on searching everywhere , and finally it was right on my lap .
grandma can' t wait to see you .

first off , you' re carrying a fare and your meter' s not on .
number two , your license is not displayed
there' s laws against molesting the handicapped , you know .

cop to cop , that subject' s not open to discussion .
why , would you miss me ?
well , destiny' s what we make it , right ?
touche .
you seem to have your reasons for checking out .
i just i would' ve expected more from someone like you .
well , i might surprise you and ... live forever .

they went to jail because they were guilty , they were scum .
he doctored the serology reports .
no , nothing was doctored .
he planted blood evidence at the crime scenes .
my work was impeccable .
