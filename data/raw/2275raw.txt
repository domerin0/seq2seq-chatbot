the frenchwoman is missing a bloody wingnut , you know , i mean it was all bollocks , it' s a ghost story , she set the fire herself .

nothing .
has anyone seen vincent ?
the dog .
anyone seen him ?
has anyone seen the dog ?
where are you going ?
i lost the damn dog .
why' d you do that ?
why' d you light the fuse man ?
why wouldn' t i light the fuse ?
ahh , maybe because i was running towards you , waving my arms , yelling " don' t do that !
well you got a point there .
i guess i was just excited to get inside , i mean , that' s why we came here isn' t it ?
that' s why we went all the way out to the black rock , and why we got the dynamite to blow the hatch .
we did it so that we could get inside hugo .
and to save everybody' s lives .
and to save everyone' s lives .
or , maybe it was just our destiny , right john ?
maybe .
guys ?
ah , it' s the hatch door , you' d better see this .
vincent !
this is not a good idea .
i saw him 5 minutes ago .
besides , you' re the one who said there wasn' t anyone out here .
i said we didn' t see anyone .
the dog will come back on his own , he always does .
watching that dog was the one thing anybody ever asked me to do .
something happens to him ...
when was the last time you slept or had something to eat ?
you' re exhausted !
i can' t tell that kid i lost his dog because i was exhausted .
i' il circle around behind him .
ok
vincent !
sayid !
sayid !
where are you ! ?
sayid !
sayid !
shannon
walt ?
shhh
what are you doing here ?
shannon !
what is it ?
what ?
why do you wanna get down there so bad ?
ly .
why do i wanna get down there so bad ly ?
jack thinks i' m crazy doesn' t he ?
why , because you wanna drop into a hatch that' s been locked from the inside , by a foot thick steel door that says quarantine ?
well look at the bright side , damage is done .
bright side ?
and if jack thinks i' ve lost it , i can' t blame him really ...
then again , 5 hours ago i was pulled into a hole by what appeared to be a column of black smoke .
did you see it kate ?
then i guess we' re both crazy !
wonder what jack thinks he saw ?
you should go ahead man , don' t want locke making time with your girl .
joke dude .
i' m not really in the mood hurley .
really ?
wow !
usually you' re like mr ha ha .
there you go .
life' s not so bad , right ?
i mean , sure the others are coming to like , eat us all , and every once in a while someone blows up all over you but , you do get to sleep in every morning .
uh huh , and the numbers ?
what ?
the numbers are bad " that' s what you were yelling right when i tackled you .
yeah it' s kind of a long story .
i got time .
you' il think i' m crazy .
try me .
a while ago , i was in this kinda psych ward , and there was this guy leonard , and all the time i knew him all he ever said were these numbers .
4 , 8 , 15, 16 , 23 , 42 .
over and over and over again .
and they kinda got stuck in my head .
so when i got out , well actually a couple of months after i got out , i was buying a frozen burrito , and i thought " hey i should play the lottery " .
and i guess those numbers were still stuck in my head , so i played them .
and i won , 114 million dollars .
that' s when it started happening .
my grandpa died , my house caught on fire , the chicken joint i worked at got hit by a meteor , well , actually meteorite .
ok , so tonight , i see the same friggin ' numbers on that hatch thing .
just written on the side , and that' s why i tried to stop it , because that thing is cursed man .
you were in a psych ward ?
i' m not crazy .
i' m not saying you are .
so , what that' s it , that' s all ?
what do you want me to say ?
how about you believe me man !
hurly , they' re numbers .
what that thing where doctors make you feel better just by talking to you ?
bedside manner .
yeah that , yours sucks dude !
what happened to him ?
you just try to relax ok ?
the car that i hit , the other driver was older .
he died in the e. r.
i can' t feel anything .
i know .
what' s happened to me ?
you have a fracture dislocation of your thorasic lumbar spine , with multiple crushed vertibrae .
your back is broken .
your spleen is ruptured and bleeding into your abdomen , and that has to be stopped .
i' m gonna perform surgery and repair as much damage as possible , but even the most optimistic result puts the likelyhood of retaining any feeling or mobility anywhere below the waist at , extremely unlikely .
oh .
doctor shepard , may i have a word please ?
so ?
what i do wrong ?
you did something wrong ?
you' re frowning .
my face is always this way .
dad , hey come on !
let' s hear it .
you might wanna try handing out some hope every once in a while .
even if there' s a 99 % probability that they' re utterly , hopelessly screwed , folks are much more inclined to hear that 1 % chance , that things are gonna be ok .
her spine' s crushed , i tell her that everything' s gonna be ok , that' s false hope dad .
look , maybe , maybe , but it' s still , hope .
i know what i saw .
it was him , it was walt !
shannon , please lower your voice you' il upset the rest of the
i heard whispers .
where ?
everywhere .
what , what whispers ?
i don' t know , them !
do you think something happened to the raft ?
nothing happened to the raft , walt is with your husband , with
sayid , i know what i saw !
they' re back .
ahh ...
locke found a , a hatch in the ground , ' bout a half a mile from here .
we left to , to blow it open so that we could hide inside .
so , all of us could hide inside , in case ...
but , that doesn' t matter now because that' s not gonna work , there' s no way for all of us to get down in there tonight .
jack ?
where' s doctor artz ?
ahh , he didn' t make it .
did you see them ?
did you see the others ?
hey !
shannon !
there are no others , we already had this conversation .
what the hell would you know about it ?
hey !
everything' s gonna be ok , let' s just , lets take it easy , we' re gonna be alright .
we' re gonna stay here tonight , ok , together , we' ve still got 4 guns , we' il put lookouts at all the entrances .
we' re all gonna be safe as long as we stay together .
the sun comes up in 3 hours and we' re all gonna be here to see that happen .
i promise .
john , what are you doing ?
i' m getting some cable .
what for ?
it' s for the hatch , i' m going in .
you really think that' s the smartest thing to do right now john ?
i doubt it , in fact you' re right , the safest thing is to stay here , wait for morning , wait for these others to see if they ever show up ...
wait for the brave folks on the raft to bring help , but me , i' m tired of waiting .
so do you believe it ?
believe what ?
that everything' s gonna be ok .
yeah , i do .
kind of unlike you , the whole glass half full thing .
there' s a glass ?
you did a good thing , saying what you said .
you' re taking care of everybody ...
just giving them something to count on .
if you weren' t here jack ...
i' m going to the hatch .
i understand why you can' t go , they need you here , i get it , i do , but locke' s going into that thing whether you like it or not .
and if he falls and breaks his neck ...
live together die alone right ?
right .
your fiance was seriously injured , could take as long as 10 , maybe 12 hours .
i won' t know how extensive the damage is until i get inside .
she was going for a dress fitting and to look at , tablecloths .
when is it ?
the wedding .
oh , it' s , 8 months .
well , i' m sure sarah will have recovered by then
recovered ?
umm , what does that mean ?
there will be ongoing physical therapy , but if she works really hard
w .. w .. will we be able to uhh ... you know ... make love ?
you need to know that there' s a chance sarah might very well need professional care for the rest of her life .
what , like she won' t be able to go to the bathroom by herself ?
come here .
come here .
i wanna tell you a little secret .
come on .
closer .
it' s ok , i know i' m not gonna be dancing anymore .
i can still roll around at my wedding .
you' re invited ok ?
i' m gonna fix you !
expected to find you halfway down there by now .
i was waiting for you .
so you want me to go down first ?
hell , you' re lighter .
i can belay you down and , bring you back up just as easy .
the shaft might get narrower down there too .
you left out the part where you just want to see if i get eaten by something .
yeah well , that too .
