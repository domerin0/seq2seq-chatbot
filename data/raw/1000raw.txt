she' s got substance .
she oozes substance .
well , go in there and talk to her .
she' s not gonna put them on the glass .

that' s the toughest move in the business .
you' re sending me into no mars land ... ... and if i get shot down , i have to crawl back .
well , i can' t do it , i tell you !
pull yourself together .
you' re going in there , soldier .
that' s an order !

hey .
hey .

help me move my refrigerator .
why ?
because i' m getting rid of it .
yeah ?
it' s k. b. i have the suit .
all right , come on up .
so ...
why get rid of your refrigerator ?
after that kidney stone , i only want fresh food .
it' s gotta be fresh .
i' m not eating any more stored food .
plus , you know , i want the space .
what for ?
well , i could put a dresser in there .
i could get dressed while i' m making breakfast .
hey !
here you go .
yeah .
didrt think i was really gonna give you a suit , did you ?
you' re giving him this suit ?
that' s right .
and it' s armani .
armani ?
hey , armani , jerry .
yes , yes , i heard .
come on , try it on .
no , it' s okay .
come on .
i want to see how it fits .
all right .
there you go .
there , okay ?
oh , boy .
look at that .
that looks great .
i can' t believe you' re giving him this .
and i don' t even want anything for it .
he' s very generous , isn' t he ?
yes .
yes , he is .
i' il tell you what , you can take me out to dinner sometime .
dinner ?
yeah , you buy me a meal .
can' t get a better deal than that .
you' il never get a better deal .
all right , i' il leave you alone .
yeah , yeah .
look at that .
armani .
yeah .
yeah , that' s a deal .
that' s a terrible deal .
i don' t want to go out to dinner with him .
i' d rather make my own suit .
i did it .
it' s all done .
hey .
i did it .
we' re going out as soon as she gets off work .
and it' il still be daytime .
i' m better in the daytime than at night .
it' s less pressure .
i love the day date .
no wine , no shower .
there you go .
so the trip was good ?
yes .
apart from that dreadful airline food .
wreaked absolute havoc with my stomach .
you know , i have to say , i' ve never admitted this to anyone ... ... but i kind of like airline food .
that' s probably because of ...
what ?
what ?
yeah , what ?
what ?
where i come from , we don' t say " what .
it' s proper to say " pardon .
oh , this should be interesting .
pardon ?
nothing .
so then , about a year ago , i started selling these funky little hair clips .
it' s going pretty good .
i make them in my apartment .
i' m just waitressing because i wanted to go to europe this summer ... ... and i could use a few extra ...
careful .
oh , it' s just horse manure .
horse manure' s not that bad .
i don' t even mind the word " manure .
you know , it' s " nure , " which is good ... ... and a " ma " in front of it .
manure .
when you consider the other choices , " manure " is actually pretty refreshing .
that' s a nice watch , george .
yeah .
you know , my boyfriend has the same one .
really ?
yeah , he loves watches .
he' s a real watch freak .
well , how about that ?
oh , look out .
you stepped right in it .
yes .
i sure did .
so you just pretended it didn' t bother you ?
what is that ?
boyfriend ?
i don' t understand that .
what does she think i asked her out for ?
it' s the way they just slip it in there too .
yeah , like it' s all just part of the conversation .
my boyfriend really likes watches .
he' s a real watch freak .
well , that' s fabulous .
well , let me ask you this .
what exactly did you say when you asked her out ?
i said , " would you like to go for a walk or something ?
oh , a walk ?
well ...
or something .
i said " or something .
or something ?
yeah , that' s a date .
there you go .
of course , there is always the possibility that she called an audible .
what do you mean ?
she got to the line of scrimmage ... ... didn' t like the looks of the defense and changed the play .
i think things were going okay .
we were having a nice conversation .
i mentioned how i liked horse manure .
you did ?
yeah .
you said you liked horse manure ?
yeah .
you know , about how , when you break it down , it' s really a very positive thing .
you know , you have a " nure " with a " ma " in front of it .
manure .
it' s not bad .
and it was around this point she mentioned the boyfriend ?
yeah .
oh , you think because of what i said about the manure ?
i was just saying how it takes a negative thing ... ... and puts a positive spin on it .
i' m just saying there' s a chance she may not have been enamored ... ... with your thoughts and feelings on manure .
so you don' t think she really has a boyfriend .
my honest opinion ?
i think she made it up .
well , then she' s just a liar , isn' t she ?
hey .
you want something to eat , don' t you ?
oh , no , no , no .
you got me all wrong , buddy .
i am loving this no refrigerator .
you know what i discovered ?
i really like depriving myself of things .
it' s fun .
very monastic .
well , what do you eat ?
it' s all fresh .
fresh fish , fresh fowl , fresh fruit .
i buy it .
i eat it .
well , i' m glad it' s working out .
oh , yeah .
it' s working out .
and i got a date with that waitress who works at reggie' s .
boy , if i could meet a hostess , we could open up our own place .
yeah .
well , i' il tell you , she' s a full figured gal .
is she ?
oh , you better believe it , buddy .
george , we could double sometime .
yeah , yeah , we could .
you know , kramer , the next time you talk to her ... ... find out if she knows kelly from monk' s .
i want to know if she really has a boyfriend .
all right , let' s get over here .
hello .
hi , jerry .
it' s kenny .
oh , hi .
i was thinking , if you' re not busy ... ... maybe i can get my meal today ?
yeah , you want to get that meal , don' t you ?
how about mendy' s .
ever been there ?
no , i haven' t .
you' re gonna love it .
i' il meet you there around 7 .
all right .
yeah , i really needed that suit .
i start off with curls .
that' s good for the bicep .
i do 10 reps , two sets .
that' s fantastic .
you work out with weights ?
i don' t .
you should .
why ?
you worn the suit yet ?
no , not yet .
have you decided ?
oh , get the swordfish .
best swordfish in the city .
the best , jerry .
i' il have the salmon .
and you ?
you know what i think ?
i' m just gonna have soup .
yeah , i' il save the meal for another time .
another time ?
what other time ?
i had a hot dog earlier .
i' m not that hungry .
no , no , bania , no .
this is the dinner .
the soup counts .
soup' s not a meal .
you' re supposed to buy me a meal .
i' m not stopping you from eating .
go ahead .
get anything you want .
but i don' t want anything but soup .
then that' s the meal .
but i had the hot dog .
who told you to have a hot dog ?
hey , i give you a brand new armani suit ... ... and you won' t even buy me a meal .
all right , fine .
get the soup .
so he just gets soup .
he wants to save the meal .
so now i got to do it all over again .
what kind of soup did he get ?
i don' t know .
consomme or something .
consomme .
what ?
well , that' s really not a meal , jerry .
i mean , if he had gotten chicken gumbo or matzo ball ... ... even mushroom barley , then i would agree with you .
those are very hearty soups .
you' re missing the whole point .
what ?
the meal is the act of sitting down with him .
it doesn' t matter what you get .
as long as he' s sitting in that restaurant , it' s a meal .
was it a cup or a bowl ?
you see ?
again .
i' m just curious .
a bowl , okay ?
did he crumble any crackers in it ?
did he crumble any crackers in it ?
as a matter of fact , he did .
oh , well , crackers in a bowl .
that could be a meal .
it' s like i' m talking to my aunt sylvia here .
hi , simon .
this is jerry .
hello .
elaine , do you have cash on you ?
yeah , in my purse .
no , there was only $6 .
well , i have some money .
what do you need ?
twenty should cover me .
thanks , mate .
where are you going ?
just visiting .
okay .
see you later .
i won' t be back for dinner .
pardon ?
so is she working ?
is she here ?
yeah , yeah , she' s here .
have you said anything ?
no .
i' m very uncomfortable .
are you gonna say anything ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
hello .
hello .
well , what' s it going to be ?
" what' s it gonna be ?
yes .
what will you have ?
are you eating ?
it' s in that vein .
i' il just have a bowl of chili .
i' il have an egg white omelet .
" what' s it gonna be ? " hear that ?
yeah , that was bad .
did you feel that tension ?
we used to have banter .
there' s no more banter .
oh , no .
it' s kenny .
slide out so he can' t sit here .
hey .
hey .
you worn the suit yet ?
actually i did .
i put it on last night and slept in it .
you did ?
no , i' m joking .
can i squeeze in ?
sure you can .
thanks .
can i take your order ?
what kind of soup do you have ?
why don' t you get a sandwich .
okay .
i' il have tomato soup and tuna on toast .
okay .
this is it , you know .
this is the meal .
so stock up , buddy boy .
what are you talking about ?
this isn' t a meal .
yes , it is .
soup and sandwich .
that is a meal .
you' re supposed to buy me dinner in a nice restaurant like mendy' s .
i tried to do that .
this is lunch in a coffee shop .
it doesn' t matter .
this is it .
this completes the transaction .
oh , soup and a sandwich for a brand new armani suit .
is that any kind of a gesture ?
i' m really not comfortable ...
hey , i just spoke to hildy about your friend .
yeah ?
she doesn' t have a boyfriend .
she made it up .
hi .
hi .
where' s simon ?
oh , he' il be right up .
he' s just getting some beer .
and i' m not expecting any change .
whers he leaving ?
about two days .
although he' s hinting at how he' d like to stay .
fortunately , he has no money and no prospects .
hey , mate .
fancy a beer ?
no , thanks .
hello ?
no , i' m sorry , bania .
i' m not going over this again .
well , who told you to order soup ?
no , there' s no dinner .
there' s not going to be any dinner .
you' ve had a sandwich and two bowls of soup , and that' s it .
goodbye .
hey , what size suit are you ?
forty .
forty .
perfect .
brand new armani suit , you want it ?
absolutely .
great .

i can' t stand the sight of it .
elaine , here' s the car keys .
thanks .
yep .
listen , jerry .
i been doing some thinking .
i want my suit back .
i don' t have your suit .
i gave it away .
well , it' s my suit .
well , it' s gone .
i' m sorry .
goodbye , bania .
hey .
hey .
yeah .
well , how' s everything ?
okay .

it' s not for me , it' s for hildy , the waitress i was telling you about .
she' s hungry .
she wants food .
if i go back in there without any food , there' s gonna be trouble .
all right , go ahead .

yeah .
there' s a few things in here .
peanut butter , cheese .
yeah .
cheese is good .
what kind ?
swiss .
all right , it' il have to do .
come on .
what are you doing out here ?
i can' t go in there .
i' m too uncomfortable .
so we' re not gonna go in there anymore ?
hey , what are you doing out here ?
we can' t eat here anymore , because he took a waitress for a walk .
what' s the difference ?
let' s go to reggie' s .
reggie' s ?
i can' t eat anything there .
it' s the same menu .
there' s no big salad .
they' il make you a big salad .
what do you think , they' re the only ones that make a big salad ?
all right , let' s go to reggie' s .
so , what' s going on with simon ?
did he leave ?
wait till you hear this .
so simon picks this woman up right in front of me .
look at this .
no egg white omelets .
look at that .
so what ?
have a yolk .
it won' t kill you .
hello .
oh , hi , hildy .
could i get an egg white omelet ?
did you read the menu ?
all right .
just give me a western .
how about a big salad ?
a big salad ?
you see ?
just tell her what you want .
they' il make it for you .
it' s a salad , only bigger , with lots of stuff in it .
i can bring you two small salads .
could you put it in a big bowl ?
we don' t have big bowls .
all right , just give me a cup of decaf .
we have sanka .
i mean , it' s not fair .
i' ve been going there for seven years .
she' s been there three weeks .
not fair .
if anyone should be forced to leave , it should be her .
she' s on your turf .
if only she could get fired .
is there any way that could happen ?
i mean , i know how to get myself fired .
you' re the best .
well ...
how do i get someone else fired ?
well , as i see it ... ... you' ve got to apply the same principles that get you fired ... ... but redirected outwardly .
hey .
hey .
she' s hungry , jerry .
well , there' s nothing left .
there' s no food .
no food ?
well , you gotta have something .
i can' t go back in there with no food .
she expecting something , jerry .
you don' t know what she' s like when that blood sugar drops .
there , you see , she' s already in a bad mood .
she just got fired .
why did she get fired ?
because i called over there a couple of times ... ... and the manager didn' t like it .
simon is definitely going back now .
he' s meeting me here to return my keys .
boy , he' s a real bounder , isn' t he ?
yes , he' s one of those bounders .
egg white omelet , big salad .
thank you .
i wanted you guys to know that friday is my last day .
bloomingdale' s ordered a bunch of my clips .
thank god .
i don' t have to do this anymore .
hey , jerry .
where' s my suit ?
i don' t have it .
you want half my omelet ?
i told you , she' s busy .
she can' t come to the phone now .
tell your boyfriend to stop calling here .
he' s not my boyfriend .
it' s that bald guy with the glasses who' s always here with them .
he' s trying to get me in trouble .
hey !
yeah .
i got a message for you .

well , hello .

you see , i' m a man of my word .
when are you leaving ?
are you trying to get rid of me ?
i was supposed to leave tomorrow , but i' ve been set up with a job interview ... ... that might enable me to extend my visit indefinitely .
and it is all due to this suit .
