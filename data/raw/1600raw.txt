archdruid gutuart ... might makes law .
the wheel of destiny threatens to crush us beneath it .
we are dying .
tell us what we must do ?
every people , every tribe needs its legend .
and every battle needs a hero .
behold .
the sign of the coming of a king .
the coming of a king ? we no longer have kings in gaul .
perhaps then , the romans .
but they have no king either .
a hero must emerge from the darkness .
he alone will keep the great wheel from crushing us beneath it .
i must go to seek him out .
do you know the meaning of my name ?
epona , the she horse .
do you know the meaning of my name ?
no .
vercingetorix , leader of the great warriors .
between a boy and a girl , there should be something more .
sorry .
are you a guest at the feast of may ?
yes .
no , y ...
well , maybe .
maybe i am .
and you my boy , who are you ?
i' m no boy .
i am vercingetorix
a heavy name to bear , leader of great warriors .
not for the son of celtill , chieftain of arvernes .
i am the daughter of mosa , chief of the bellovaques .
who are you ?
nobody .
i am the seed blown by the winds of fortune .
i am a spore that may take roots .
spoken like a druid .
i' m just a poor minstrel .
ln fact , my finances might greatly improve ... if i could gain entrance to yonder feast ... by the grace of some noble guest .
like yourself .
i would welcome you to gergovia then .
take my horse .
thank you .
tell my father i have sent you and he will refuse you nothing .
thank you , leader of great warriors .
you give him your trust , just like that .
he pleased me .
you please me too .
and don' t forget if your brother celtill persists ... you must obey our laws ... and separate his soul from his corrupted body .
gutuart is wrong .
there must not be a king in gaul !
the feast has not yet begun .
you have no business here now .
i' m returning the horse , uncle .
what are you doing , my son ?
showing epona the city , mother .
leticia , make sure there are flowers on every table .
come on .
someday , you' il be my queen .
your queen ?
i like the sound of that .
but there are no more kings in gaul .
for the moment .
for the moment ?
it' s a secret .
follow me .
my father is meeting with all the chiefs of gaul .
i welcome you , noble chieftains of the other peoples of gaul .
and particularly you , dumnorix , chieftain of the eduens ... and diviciac , your brother and grand druid ... and our friends from the north , the great commios ...
and the valiant mosa .
chief of the bellovaques .
you also gobannitio my brother ... and you calarix , senator of the arvernes .
gutuart , our archdruid will be present to witness our meeting .
do you imagine yourself becoming the new brennus , king of the gauls ?
have you forgotten that the arvernes have proclaimed a republic ?
i haven' t forgotten , gobannitio ... that you want to become chieftain of this aristocratic republic ... which makes the rich richer ... and the poor poorer .
but let us put aside these petty rivalries .
we gauls are trapped between two great monsters .
to our north , the teutons ... and at the south , the romans .
do you forget that it was you who hired the teuton mercenaries ... to conquer other lands ?
the romans are no menace .
for the moment .
what are you saying ?
i' m saying you went to rome to beg caesar to come to gaul .
i say that the legions of rome will devastate our lands ... and destroy everything in which we believe .
i say , better , diviciac , the people of gaul united under a king .
i tell you , my brother ... rather a king at the head of gaul ... than your secret pacts with the romans .
let us unite and together expel both the teutons and the romans .
ln great and glorious battles .
one day , i' il be your queen .
here is the crown once worn by the king of the gauls .
father , no !
take your crown .
run !
epona !
give me that .
vercingetorix , go .
this is between arvernes .
stay out of it .
gobannitio !
no , my boy .
not that .
i want to save my father .
of course you want , but you cannot .
i must save my father .
he has to accept his destiny ... and so must you .
according to our law ... we must separate your spirit from your perverted body .
foul reptile !
it isn' t the law that you serve , but your own vile ambition .
and you my brother are no better .
farewell celtill .
the eduens will not be part of such treason .
nor will the atrebates .
farewell .
you' re more afraid to kill me , than i am to die .
hand me the torch , gobannitio .
you' re not worthy of sacrificing your brother you betrayed .
his death belongs to him alone .
the magic of his death must teach us the lesson of his sacrifice .
the greater the magic , the greater the price that must be paid .
i will kill you , gobannitio .
i will kill you .
i will kill you .
i will kill you , gobannitio .
get up .
even if everyone in gaul is divided ... here , there is neither tribe nor people .
no distinctive mark .
drop that .
get up !
hurry up !
where are you going ?
it' s time for me to do what i must .
i have a task to accomplish .
you' re not ready .
not yet .
come with me .
i will introduce you to a master .
rhia , i' ve brought you a young friend .
just try not to hurt him .
draw a single drop of my blood ... and you can do whatever you want .
i thought it was impossible .
it is impossible .
fighting must be a pleasure .
look at me .
learn my moves .
learn to anticipate each other ... provoke your partner , entice your opponent to dare .
capture his rage and make it your own .
lead the dance .
lf you know what you want , your partner will want it too .
attack again .
to be one with your sword , you must empty yourself of all desire .
and when i' il learn to do that will i' il have a drop of your blood ?
when you achieve that , you' il dispose of my life .
you must become a master druid .
i will become a master druid .
then the game will be over , and you will accomplish your destiny .
did you see your death , vercingetorix ?
no .
i was king .
what does it mean ?
the knowledge that comes to you in dreams is yours alone .
a man' s destiny is also his alone .
yes .
then i must follow it .
the greater your destiny the greater the price that you must pay .
since the flames consumed my childhood , all i' ve done is study .
and now , i' ve been told it' s time to act .
just don' t abandon the path of knowledge ... when you take the road of action .
beware of this course of action .
for years our chiefs have been victims of their own demons ... they have formed alliances , and betrayed each other .
i' il show you where this will lead you .
the romans act without true knowledge .
see what they do : a sword of stone right through the living heart of the land .
you must travel this road for a while .
so here our paths must diverge .
look !
now , kick me in the ass .
what ?
they' ve seen my druid' s robe !
so do what i tell you .
i' m a bothersome beggar .
kick me in the ass and hound me into the woods .
alright .
go away !
go away !
come on .
go away !
please .
and don' t come back !
please .
i' m sorry .
where is the druid ?
what druid ?
the man in the white robe .
oh , a beggar , nothing more !
who would dare lay hands on a druid .
diviciac ?
you know me , arverne ?
you' d be a hard man to forget , for the son of celtill .
we thought you were dead .
where are you going ?
gergovia .
well , i am going to bibracte to meet the other chiefs of gaul .
would you like to join me ?
for a while .
what keeps you here so far from rome ?
the same thing that kept you hidden in the woods ... and now sets you on my road .
destiny !
spoken like a druid !
actually , i was once a kind of a druid of some kind ... a high priest of rome .
it cost me a lot of money .
are you a druid ?
no , i chose another path .
so did l .
i choose to serve rome .
rome to which all roads lead : bridges , aqueducts , roads ... the free movements of goods and men ... and for the good of all the civilised world !
so the selfless caesar comes to gaul to bring civilisation ... to us , poor barbarians .
yes .
yes .
one may be born as a barbarian ... but earns the right to call himself a citizen of rome .
assemble your warriors .
join me on my expedition to britain .
win fame , glory , and roman citizenship .
and half of everything you seize .
so , our paths diverge now ... but not too long i think .
thank you for the horse .
i will return it .
do you think he could win back gergovia by himself ?
that boy !
somehow , gistus ...
i do believe he could !
he never agrees with anything !
sure .
no , no , please .
look there , he' s riding a roman general' s horse !
it' s beautiful .
i wonder where he comes from .
who are you ?
what do you think you' re doing ?
setting my house in order ...
and avenging my father .
i come to offer you adventure .
i will lead all the warriors of gaul to invade the island of britain .
i offer you glory and fortune .
i have the word of caesar ... that we shall have half the booty .
and to prove it , he has given me his horse .
half the booty .
can you believe it ?
you are welcome among us .
ride at the head of our arverne troops ... and represent us proudly before caesar .
why haven' t your spies found the archdruid ?
i' m sure he' s the one who teaches them ... to believe in perpetual changes .
he' s my true enemy .
mosa' s daughter , epona might recognise me .
i salute you , friends ... and allies of rome .
dumnorix and litavic , chieftains of the eduens ...
diviciac , commios ... the valiant mosa , chief of the bellovaques .
i liberated you from the teutons and i brought you peace .
caesar offers pardon to those who fought against him .
and his friendship to those who will serve him .
here , britain , a rich land ... inhabited by barbarians so primitive ...
that they paint their faces blue .
and they go to war .
let' s invade britain ...
and half the booty is yours .
i can' t go .
why not ?
i get seasick .
the gods are with us , dumnorix .
and i guarantee you the sea will be calm .
caesar accepts your children as guarantee that you will be loyal .
epona , princess of the bellovaques ... will take care of the younger ones .
dumnorix takes hostages .
he doesn' t give them .
never .
yes .
yes .
this is what i want in exchange for the booty .
no , caesar .
this is an incredible total .
for the arms ?
for the jewellery ?
for the thousands of slaves ?
you still owe us what you borrowed to pay for the festivals .
popularity is expensive .
i don' t owe you anything anymore .
but from now on , you will owe me .
the taxes will be divided between rome and you and me .
i need another four legions .
to conquer britain ?
i' m sending the gauls .
i have to get rid of them .
what cynicism !
another word for politics !
open the gates !
you were right about vercingetorix .
he has done it .
he' s here .
that' s a gift of the gods .
and i knew it .
another future victory ... for caius julius caesar , proconsul of transalpine gaul .
for the moment .
a victory over the britons ... will bring me no closer to a triumphal return to rome ... and rome no closer to the government it must have .
julius caesar , king of the romans ?
king ?
vercingetorix , no .
a king who founds a dynasty is a hero ... but his son is a mediocrity , and his grand son a half wit or a monster ... and his great grand son probably both .
no !
i don' t seek to destroy the republic .
only to rule it .
a modest enough ambition .
when alexander the great was ten years younger than i am today ... he had conquered the entire civilised world .
at your age , he was dead .
all the more reason to hurry .
dine with me tonight .
i' m sure you will find it interesting .
i' m afraid we will never reach britain in such weather .
the gauls only fear having the sky fall on their heads .
and the gaul who said that to alexander ... was struck dead by lightening .
take this diviciac !
listen to me .
so dumnorix , still afraid of the sea ?
i guarantee that the sea will be calm .
it' s not the sea sickness i fear , but caesar .
he offers us half the booty , and that' s not enough for you ?
it' s too much .
we must respect the pact it was you ... you , my brother who made the pact for the eduens .
it' s not for me or my sons to respect it .
dumnorix !
whatever i can .
whenever i can .
i do believe that you know each other .
i do ?
or have you forgotten the girl you asked to be your queen ?
epona ?
your queen ?
the king' s wife ?
when i met him in his village , i was a little provincial girl ... impressed by the son of a local chieftain ... who was even more impressed with himself .
and what have you become , now ?
a civilised and educated woman .
lmpressed by a roman general who is even more impressed with himself ?
i am , after all , an impressive man .
we are all impressive people .
you know ... sometimes i think ... that your father ... was ahead of his time ... and he had very good ideas .
to drive your legions from gaul ?
too many tribes .
you have too many tribes .
and each chieftain has to be elected every year .
that' s a mess .
i want to govern rome .
that' s my destiny .
the destiny of the gauls might be to ... have a king ...
chosen by rome .
why not a king chosen by destiny ?
i knew you would come .
you seem to know caesar pretty well .
caesar visits me often .
you' re jealous ?
i think often of the young boy of gergovia ... to whom i gave a token of my fidelity .
why do you think he brought us together ?
it' s always wise to assume caesar knows everything he should know .
dumnorix doesn' t trust him .
julius caesar .
i trust him as much as i trust you .
what is that supposed to mean epona ?
you are and will always be ... the leader of great warriors .
ave !
dumnorix .
he stormed into our camp !
he massacred our soldiers and then fled .
continue loading the boats .
your brother , i knew he would betray me .
we should kill all the hostages .
no , please , don' t do that caesar .
dumnorix must be tried according to our rules .
i want to see him .
let me send litavic after him .
no , i don' t trust the eduens anymore , and i don' t trust you .
then send vercingetorix .
he' s an arverne .
well ... if that is your choice
no hostages are to be executed .
bring him back ...
alive .
like the mercenaries of rome ... you still wear your cloak on your right shoulder .
i came to bring you back .
ls the silver tongued vercingetorix trying to convince me ... or does the leader of great warriors want to bring me back by force ?
we might as well talk , we can always fight to death later .
what order of caesar did you come to execute , riding his own horse ?
to bring you back to be tried according to our laws .
your brother demanded it .
i' m very thankful , and i am overjoyed to see myself ... being condemned by my brothers in the camp of caesar .
lf you don' t come back ... the eduen hostages will be executed , and maybe others with them .
no , no , no .
what are you saying ?
even if he were furious , and he must be ...
caesar will never kill the hostages .
what gaul would embark for britain if he executed his children ?
he will not do it .
what do we do now ?
i thought to offer you my horse ... and then together , let' s go to avenge the death of your father .
have you never asked yourself ... who would set eduens against eduens , and arverne against arverne ?
who profited the most from the death of celtill ?
vercingetorix , go !
go !
bring back to caesar what belongs to caesar .
and give my tribute to him .
your father was a good man .
i think we should go to gergovia , right now !
let' s go .
what does this hand mean ?
that we have made an enemy ... and it would have been much better to have him as a friend .
throw the hostages into prison ... and lock epona in a cell .
let it be known that caesar will be grateful ... to the man who finds vercingetorix .
close the gates !
you are banned from the city .
caesar has put a price on your head .
they massacred all of the druids .
but i came back to wait .
ls gutuart still alive ?
brother and sister of the sword !
now you can dispose of my life .
the game will be over soon then .
stay here .
keep an eye on them !
we want vercingetorix as our war leader .
senators , we command you elect him chieftain of the arvernes !
i will not be elected by these cowards ... but by the acclamation of my people .
caesar cannot make me an outlaw !
he is my enemy and i would be your king .
we want vercingetorix to be our leader !
long live vercingetorix ...
king of the arvernes .
ln the memory of my father ...
i proudly accept .
people of gaul .
let us be what we must be ... a free and united people .
together we will chase the romans out of gaul .
they are our enemies ... and all who serve them , traitors .
burn the reserves and the barns .
you want to ruin us !
do as i say or i' il burn them myself .
here little ones , this is for you .
he' s burning all of gaul while your legions are dying of hunger .
the men are starting to cast hungry looks at the horses .
he' s an intelligent leader .
he refuses to engage the enemy .
that' s not a very glorious strategy .
but an effective one .
let us return to our own province .
neither glorious , nor effective .
we will walk through the fire and attack avaricum .
like the scorpion !
i will follow my own logic until death .
let see which logic vercingetorix follows .
evacuate the city ... or i will burn it to ashes with your people still inside .
what right do you have , arvern ?
i can' t let the romans take avaricum with all its supplies .
i would burn gergovia my own town if i had to .
then , defend the city with us .
the besieged can' t win .
because of our stupidity , caesar would snatch his victory ... from thejaws of defeat in which i have trapped him .
one life for a city .
i offer you the innocent life of my child .
lf you really believe it will serve the cause of gaul ... great king vercingetorix , kill him .
may he live to become a man worthy of his mother .
may avaricum survive to see it .
let us fight a great battle !
we should fight them now .
i' m going to gergovia .
did i do the right thing ?
or will i live to regret it ?
you did what you thought was right ... instead of what you knew was necessary .
was that a mistake ?
might does not make right ... nor does wrong .
but might is part of this world of human conflict ... where we all are prisoners .
that' s the real trap .
your incomprehensible talking does not help me .
do you think so ?
now we will do what vercingetorix hasn' t done .
like the scorpion , victory or death .
we' il kill all the inhabitants .
i want a blood bath .
caesar , it' s not necessary .
all the women ... all the elders , even all the children .
thanks to you , they' ve all perished !
you abandoned them .
you refused to fight .
you are a coward .
and you would turn us all into cowards .
you promised to lead us to victory .
what victory ?
the one he promised to caesar ?
you accuse me of treason ?
then kill me .
yes , i betrayed gaul .
yes , i was a coward .
your anger is my anger ... at myself .
because i made one mistake .
i listened to you .
the city had to burn .
and would i had done it ... the inhabitants would still be alive ... and the troops of caesar famished .
but caesar made a worse mistake ... when he ordered this slaughter ... which horrifies and revolts my heart ... and yours , and the hearts of all gauls .
now if you think you' ve done me a favour by giving me this command ...
and if you think i' m no longer worthy of this honour ...
i' il hand it back to you right now .
destiny .
that is destiny .
disgusting !
it was a real useless ... slaughter .
useless ?
now we will have a decisive battle .
i' ve found the secret of the gallic swords .
we march to gergovia .
position the catapults .
load them .
hurry up !
why ?
there' s no one there .
form your lines .
get ready .
vercingetorix is surrounded .
he doesn' t dare show himself .
let' s attack !
your ally litavic , has just arrived .
on my word !
hey , you men , we' ve got something for you .
look up here .
come on , we' re ready for you .
you' re so shy !
come taste this , please .
take a look ...
i mean to be the first .
form a pyramid .
you' il get to see what real men are like !
look what' s waiting for you .
look .
you' re shy !
death to caesar , death to caesar .
kill them all .
death to the romans ...
we' re not afraid of any roman !
well they' re your allies .
i just hope they' re up to it .
the eduens are with you .
caesar has massacred avaracum .
he' s no longer our friend .
you , who has united us in this fight .
you are my brother .
here .
that bastard litavic !
may every single gaul be cursed .
let' s attack !
victory !
victory !
victory !
victory !
victory !
victory !
vercingetorix , king of the arvernes ...
leader of the great warriors .
what do you see after the victory ?
i see all the peoples of gaul united .
united ?
under the dark desire of revenge ?
no .
i want to force caesar back on the same road he himself built .
it is roads which use the pretext of free movement of goods and men ... to accelerate the orders of the empire ... which strangles us to satisfy its ambition .
ln my father' s memory , i will realise the magic he wanted to create .
chase the germans and the romans out of gaul .
gauls ...
i welcome you to bibracte .
vercingetorix has done what no one has ever done before .
he has defeated the mighty caesar at the head of his legions .
six legions of them at least .
ten !
a hundred !
a hundred !
our women have proven that they could take care of a hundred legions .
shall we elect vercingetorix commander in chief of the army ... to get rid of the romans and the teutons .
i don' t want a battle ... even if we win .
and if we do ...
rome will not rest until that victory is turned into defeat .
maybe so .
to cut caesar roads to the north we should hire the teutons .
you' re crazy .
they burned your father for less than that .
that' s not what they want from you .
don' t tell them such a thing .
listen .
what they all want now is a final battle .
we must continue .
we will be victorious .
i took arms for the freedom of all .
i pledge my life up to the last drop of my blood ... no matter what sacrifice destiny may call upon me to make .
be with me and i will lead you to victory ... into thejaws of death with a battle song in my heart .
now , let us choose our capital .
the capital should be pabracs .
why ?
the cadurques shall follow ... the orders of the eduens .
the capital should be genabum .
genabum !
i was very worried about you .
i was never afraid .
i was locked in a cell alone .
i had time to think about you ... about caesar , about his promises and his lies ... but mainly about you .
and do you still trust the leader of the great warriors ... who wanted you to be his queen ?
at the time i accepted when i was asked by the boy .
and now ?
i' d be honoured to be asked by the king of the arvernes .
not for you , for her .
like everyone , i have come to humbly bow before the conqueror of caesar ... before he who had me liberated .
wait , i want to talk to you .
wait !
between a boy and a girl , there should be something more .
i only want you as my queen , but ...
but ?
but what ?
well , i might be gone for an eternity .
since it' s only that , take me with you then .
no , i can' t , not to war .
my place is wherever you will be .
no .
no , it' s impossible .
you think ?
try to stop me !
you are beautiful .
go and warn the others .
i want to know what the teutons are doing here .
send out scouts .
yes sir .
we must hurry .
we need shelter .
come on !
let' s go !
he' s here , he' s here .
allow me the honour of giving you my bedroom .
put it over there on the table .
hurry up , please .
we are preparing the room for the bellovaque princess .
i thank you chieftain of alesia for your hospitality .
i am sure the staff of our commander can organise his own quarters .
go and help him .
do it !
what ?
help him .
over there .
as they say , war is hell .
i also want to be a great warrior .
we' il talk about it later .
the army can retire ; we can manage on our own .
you want to be my squire ?
yes !
it' s good to be inside .
to us .
do you know who the goddess of alesia is ?
no .
no , who ?
it' s the horse goddess epona .
you crack yourself up , fancy helmet .
caesar is coming to besiege us .
too risky for him .
he knows we have an immense army .
he must know , but that' s what i believe he will do .
we should leave here now .
leave here ?
i thought you wanted one great final battle , just like caesar .
ls it what gaul really needs ?
no ... but now the die is already cast .
the battle you longed for has already begun .
we' ve got food for one month .
cut the rations in half .
equal rations for the army and for the civilians .
you must ride to the four winds ... gather a huge army of relief and return .
it is your challenge , make it work .
lf you want to win this battle , you must return before the next moon .
you will be the hammer , and i will be the anvil .
and please , remember .
do not attack .
what ?
do not attack .
the gauls will send a relief army .
i know , and i' il be ready before they arrive .
caesar' s fortifications worry me and demoralise the army .
but not me .
he won' t have time to finish them .
the teutons are everywhere ... but our spies can' t really find out what they are really here for .
caesar bought them .
there we are open to the valley .
i' il let you pass if you tell me where your archdruid is .
we don' t know .
we don' t understand him anyway , so how can we tell you about him .
strange !
you want to join vercingetorix , to aid him against me .
we don' t interfere with your world of strife .
your vercingetorix dealt me some superb and unexpected blows ... and you enjoy it , as much as i do .
to you , the prize of victory is indispensable caesar .
without it , your life is meaningless .
druids .
i have to establish an absolute place to stand ... always the same , immutable .
i have to extend an empire and to hold it together .
that is destiny .
your words reduce others to silence .
but when you have suppressed all your adversaries ... there will be no more combat , caesar .
your world will be irresistible and your isolation complete .
i won' t let you go to alesia .
we must elect the general of the relief army .
time is short , gauls !
vercingetorix desperately awaits our coming .
each of you take a ball to vote .
each in turn .
good .
good .
ten !
i said each in turn .
all our foragers who tried to reach the countryside ... were massacred by the romans .
and all the romans who left their camp were massacred by the gauls .
maybe , but this does not provide us anything to eat .
hey !
when will this famous army of yours arrive ?
i' m saving the rat for those traitors .
we' il cut their balls and eat them ... if they ever get here , the miserable cowards .
they will come .
vercingetorix escapes us again .
the gauls don' t eat their horses .
they send them out because they can' t feed them .
but he has stayed .
let' s attack now ... while we still have our strength .
we must endure ... for the sake of the army of gauls coming to join us .
the fear of their coming ... keeps the romans working night and day to build their fortifications .
listen , if they find themselves fighting over our corpses ... what heart do you think they will have for it ?
or you doubt their faithfulness because they haven' t arrived yet ?
i' m sorry , you' re right .
we cannot survive much longer on the food we have left .
we must send everyone who cannot fight out of alesia .
they might have more chances of survival in the countryside .
don' t send out the children .
i' il take care of them .
you' re right .
the druids will help you .
they' re all asleep .
the hammer will never meet the anvil .
i will win this battle ... if the army obeys me .
what are you afraid of ?
the deep silence of others .
twenty balls for litavic .
twenty balls for virido .
twenty balls for commios .
pig heads !
the general has to have the majority .
twenty balls for cassivelaun .
this is intolerable .
the leader must be me .
me .
a parisi !
silence !
we' ve lost too much time already .
there will be no leader , but four equal generals
yes , me .
virido , commios ...
cassivelaun , and me .
our orders are still not to attack .
yes .
we can' t stay here doing nothing .
what is it going to change ?
spring will still come , grass will still grow by itself ... and now caesar is besieged in his own fortifications .
and the teutons won' t attack ... if we stay well organised .
what if they don' t attack ?
then we die .
it' s triumph or death .
and what will decide ?
destiny , brutus .
destiny !
hello .
hi .
won' t you play with us ?
one toss , catch with one hand .
those are the rules !
lf i score the same , we play again .
all right .
we' re even !
play again !
you said one toss , with one hand .
no .
the rules have changed .
you always change the rules .
i mean , you can' t play like that .
he' s right .
you' re even .
he' s not playing to lose or to win .
he wants to keep the game from ending because he wants us to stay together .
for me it' s all over .
but you must go on and fulfil your destiny .
and now you must not let the great wheel of destiny ... roll over the people of gaul .
go to her .
there will not be many more nights .
do not attack !
do not attack !
carnix .
they haven' t listened .
they' re attacking anyway .
how stupid !
caesar , they' re attacking from all sides .
as i always told you ... that' s what happens if you don' t have a commander in chief .
carnix .
carnix .
carnix .
carnix !
yes !
you .
you want to fight ?
you want to die ?
you want to live forever ?
then i will lead you , and together ... we will become immortal .
don' t be afraid , brutus ;
go !
and now unleash the cavalry .
he has always refused the decisive battle .
i' m sure he' s up to something .
and i don' t understand what .
i do not like what i don' t understand .
the final battle he never wanted is a real massacre ... and litavic is dead .
he wanted to hire the teutons ... and we stopped him .
and now what are we to do ?
well , it' s up to him .
we can only wait ... and see what he' il do !
when the people will not follow where you lead ... you must follow them ... or walk alone .
you were right , the game should never stop .
what does it matter at the end ... to win what your enemy will lose ... or to lose what he will win ?
where will it lead you ?
as far as my energy will allow ... so the greatwheel of destiny will follow its course ... eternally moved by love , as far as necessity demands .
i' ve always known that i would always love you .
i will not have another queen ... but you .
he' s going where nothing more can be written .
the greater the magic , the greater the price that must be paid .
i have only started what i will never finish .
i come to offer you the glory of your victory ... which rome will forever honour ... with inscriptions in stone and eternal flames .
the light of my victory will make my invisible past failures heavier .
i offered to make you a king .
so accept the surrender of a king .
caesar was never emperor of rome .
on the ldes of march , 44 bc ... he was assassinated on the steps on the senate .
his faithful brutus struck the fatal blow .
a few steps away , two years earlier , at about two in the afternoon ...
vercingetorix , imprisoned in the tulianum ... was executed by order of caesar .
he did not win the gallic war ... but for the first time , he had united all its people ... who , still today live on in our memory .
