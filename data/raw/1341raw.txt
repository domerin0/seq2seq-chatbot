bad idea
good evening .
dr. jennings .
oh , yes , doctor .
may i say that several of our guests have mentioned they are much looking forward to see your presentation tonight .
oh , it' s nice to hear .
where is my baby ?
wow , you don' t want to shoot me , mrs. jennings .
shut up !
where is she ?
abby is with my cousin .
my cousin has a celil phone .
if i don' t call him every 30 minutes , he is going to kill her , as if you would want him to do
i' d just say that you definitely look prettier than this .
sit down !!
look , mrs. jennings .
nothing' s going to happen to abby as long as nothing happens to me .
okay ?
you can count on marvin .
he always does what exactly what he' s told .
and it' s always that' s me to tell him .
what do you want ?
you are a smart lady .
you pick up things really quickly .
you do .
you see what we have here is a kidnapping for ransom .
but see , it' s not just any kidnapping .
it' s a perfect kidnapping .
and i know that perfect , because i' ve done it 4 times before i caught you .
take me to her , you son of a bitch !
i know , i know exactly what you' re thinking .
i' il tell you what happened to the other 4 kids .
i want you to know every single one of those kids is right at this moment , watching barney , swimming in the pools , or riding the ponys , or whatever the fuck you have for your rich little kids do .
it' s all because i give the parents the power to keep them alive .
if you follow the rules and let me make my cost tomorrow to keep him safe
now , karen .
it' s okay .
i' il call him , karen .
you keep that gun if you want .
if it makes you feel any better but i just going to tell you something about the gun , okay ?
you' il kill 2 people one for one .
me and abby .
may i ?
thanks .
it' s a quite a place you got here .
thank you .
we' re previleged to have with us tonight a young physician i first met when he was a young irish medical student doing research on disadaptive properties of guiness , if i remember correctly .
since then , i have watched him progress from intern to resident , to research scientist and finally the best of all i think you' d agree .
paten holder
ladies and gentlmen ,
dr. william jennings .
why won' t you let me empty our accounts and give you the money now ?
i don' t think you have a backseat closet .
another thing , it will look a little suspicious , don' t you think ?
you see , unlike me , most kidnappers are morons .
they all get busted the minute they try to go for the ransom money .
they try all kinds of comlicated shit but you know , the fact the matter is , no ransom pickup is safe from the fbl .
you see the statistics from this country .
damn , zero kidnappings for ransom was successful . and you know why ?
it' s because of the ransom pickup .
that' s why i can' t go to pick up any ransom .
is that beautiful or what ?
why can' t abby be here right now ?
because this is a machine .
okay ?
this is a machine that runs on fear .
your fear for abby .
tell me the truth .
that' s the only thing that kept you from pulling the trigger .
and you' re ready to go .
am i right ?
am i right ?
until now , position has been unable to use paralyzing alexins of that fear of fatal outcomes , all costly losses .
that day is over .
i am now adjusting the patients for the rest arrays .
developed by myself and bryan adams' s pharmaceutical company , and tested in my own clinical trials at storium memorial hospital in portland ,
within seconds , this 3rd generation varied into atropine counteracts the effect of the succinic aconite restoring full nerve combatively and muscle function .
don' t you have any feeling for the children you' re hurting ?
if you can' t stand anything for 24 hours ,
i won' t be still alive for years .
what are you talking about 24 hours ?
all shows take exactly 24 hours .
day' s work for day' s pay .
2 and 50 k.
oh my god , listen to me .
if you wait till tomorrow
abby could die .
no , no , no .
you listen to me okay ?
we' re on a timetable here .
let' s get something straight .
there are no dvas , since no exceptions and no surprises .
she is asthmatic .
she' s severly asthmatic .
she could have attack anytime .
let' s try .
open the drawer you' re sitting on .
open it !!
abigal
shit !
anything could bring an attack on .
allegy , smoke , stress
please tell me your cousin doesn' t smoke .
does he smoke ?
shit !
shut up !
hey , where are you ?
hey , we' re almost there .
you' re early .
what' s the matter ?
hey listen , listen .
take a look at the kid .
give me the phone !
we got a situation here , marvin .
you want me to take care of her ?
no !!
not yet .
well , it' s been over 30 seconds .
we' d better hang up .
this is what i want you to do .
i want you to take a look at the kid and put your hand on her chest .
is she breathing ?
hold on .
it' s a kind of like ... shallow .
all right .
this is what i want you to do .
i want you to get her inside .
and i want you to close the window ,
let her wander around , okay ?
she has a trouble breathing .
give her strong coffee decaf and open her airways .
joe , you want me to do that ?
yes
just call me if there' s a problem , okay ?
you would be grateful if i helped your little girl , right ?
yes .
what ?
yes .
how would you show me ?
you take me to her first .
and then i' il show you .
how does every woman know that ?
how to be a hooker .
get the payment upfront !
is that what you' re teaching at the awkward workshop ?
nobody is to teach how to protect your child .
you' d know that if you' re behind one .
hey marvin , it' s me .
we' re almost there .
she is still sleeping .
yeah , okay , i' il call you .
they are not there yet .
i' d like to see the bedroom .
come on .
hey , dr. jennings .
hi
can i help you ?
listen , my keycard doesn' t work .
i was wondering if i could use your phone to call the frontdesk .
you know that there' s a phone right by the elevator .
you' re right .
that must be such a rush , huh ?
just standing up there , having everybody want to be you .
a young guy with big idea and a big future
i got hot just as watching you .
i am flattered .
i am ... well , i' m so ... married .
then we can do things to talk out .
because it' s something i' il do it ... not you .
oh , i' m sorry , darling , but ...
i don' t think it' s going to happen .
you will find some other things . you' il find 50 .
just not me .
good night .
50 is not good to me , doc .
' cause abby doesn' t have 50 , daddy' s .
what did you say ?
your daughter has been kidnapped for 3 hours .
and she' s not going to live thru the night if you don' t let me in your room right now .
i' m calling to police .
don' t fucking use that phone .
if you call the cops or house , whatever you may have , it' s going to be the bullet into abby' s brain .
all right .
i have to make a phonecall in the next 5 minutes .
if anything stops me making that phonecall , your kid is dead .
what do i have to do get my little girl back ?
you know whole new world , dr. jennings .
right now my partner has your wife at your house .
the little girl is being held in 3rd location .
where ?
when you calm down
i' m going to make a phonecall .
after that , this phone is going to ring every 30 minutes and if i don' t say things are cool
you may as well pick out of 3 book cascade .
where is my little girl ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know where your little girl is .
i only know she' s being held in some place the police can' t possibly get to in there 30 minutes between our phonecalls .
that' s not going to happen .
sit down .
you skip the part of at us getting , then i' il be back .
tomorrow morning , your wife is going to wire $250, 000 to a local bank .
you' re going to go pick up that money .
after you give it to me , your wifeand your child will be let go with inside of each other .
how would she going to explain them ?
oh , please .
she' s going to call your broker .
she' s going to say that you stumbled onto another painting .
that you simply had to add your crappy little art collection .
you got this whole thing covered , doctor .
it' s really fucking easy .
you follow the rules and get abby back .
it' s that simple .
you think i' d believe that after i' ve seen your face ?
this is the 5th time we' ve done this .
all the other parents saw our faces .
not one them reported the police .
you know why ?
' cause if you go to the police , to look at them , we' il know .
my partner will come back and he' il kill your child .
marvin , is everything all right ?

this is succinic aconite , sheryl .
if i inject this to your body , you will be paralyzed .
you will be able to see , hear , and think , but you won' t able to move , and you won' t be able to breathe .
what the fuck are you doing , man ?
sheryl , i have seen murderers turning to a whimpering babies by this stuff .
you have a choice
you can tell me where you' re holding abby
or you can find out what it feels like to die .
if i pull this trigger , you will be dead .
pull it .
no
don' t fight it , sheryl
i know you can hear me .
you' re struggling , aren' t you ?
telling your arms to move , but they won' t .
you want to breathe , but you can' t .
unless i give you the antidope .
it' s like living death , isn' t it , sheryl ?
maybe your feeling' s almost as my little girl' s right now .
we are going to do this over and over until you tell me where abby is .
or until i can bring her back .

you looked after her breathing .
you didn' t monitor her pressure .
i remember every details of katie' s case .
she had grumes in tumor , the sergeon had difficulty trying to remove , but he couldn' t control her major argon he couldn' t control her bleeding .
he said she was barbiturated and covered
he said his operation was well .
then he lied to you , sheryl .
he told you katie was recovering to protect himself
' cause you wouldn' t think it is his fault .
jesus
this is why you chill us all .
' cause you want a revenge .
oh , no , you can' t get that hard .
sheryl , you have to tell where my daughter is .
there' s an cabin at the eastern hold in caskey .
okay , it' s time to make the call .
you think you' re smarter than all the other moms ?
no , you are not .
' cause they didn' t hurt me .
and now you get your daughter alive ?
i want you to think about marvin now .
sitting there , watching the clock .
waiting
it' s time .
it' s time to play the game .
first , you have to close your eyes .
joe , she is my daughter .
she is my little girl .
okay now , what you have to do ... is you have to think nice thoughts .
pretty thoughts .
i' m thinking about my mommy .

that a guy like me could be motivated by something other than grip .
hank , wake up , it' s emergency .

my child is in danger but you can help her .
before i tell you anything ,
you got to promise me not to call the police .

we have to wait for a phonecall .
and then we can go .
those are the rules .
it' s fine that they always do it the same with clouds and sun for hours .
she doesn' t have good hands , you know .
they have travelled with that , but she is good .
