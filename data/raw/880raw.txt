bullshit !
no , it' s not bullshit .
i know those two kids .
those are good kids .
richard morris just won a scholarship to college .
you don' t want him to lose that over a simple joyride .

y eah , yeah .
well ?
okay , they' il be out within an hour .

and leave the dice and the cards .
what happened to you today ?
i don' t understand you , jackson .
you read poetry books and history books for fun ... and you make the worst grades in two states .
you didn' t even try to make up the midterm you missed .
don' t you want to graduate ?
don' t much matter .
