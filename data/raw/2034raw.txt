strife presents ...
after shinsengumi' s relocation to nishihongan
temple it held a competition for new members
initially , the company had recruited liberally from dojos swordplay academies throughout the region
thus among the first recruits were men of dubious character
now , circumstances had changed
next !
who have we here ?
that !
a merchant s son
not a spy ?
his master , the samurai
senzaemon hamano of the shingyo toryu school has written to recommend him
after his apprenticeship he taught under the master
his background ?
his father owns echigoya
kimonos a textile wholesaler near hamano' s dojo
he' s the third born son
name ?
sozaburo kano
soji' s having trouble
this charts his lineage
echigoya was founded in the north , the kano district
four centuries ago , his ancestor , kano utanosuke a renowned samurai , was retainer to a feudal lord
today , kano' s descendants are merchants here in kyoto
they kept the ancestral
kano , " though by law only samurai may use surnames
take a look
he' s the last ?
hyozo tashiro
a former retainer of the
kurume han , feudal clan now a free lance
one of our controls suggested him
like kano , he fought his way up through the early rounds without yielding once
okita won that match but his opponent has guts
only those two are worth taking on
what do you say , hijikata ?
kano and tashiro
fine
and you , ito san ?
i' il consent
i have my doubts about the wisdom of judging by swordsmanship alone but as that is your policy ...
shinsengumi exists to destroy any who defy the government
kano , tashiro
commander' s quarters
here , here , we are not lord and vassal
come forward
kano , how old are you now ?
i am almost eighteen
eighteen ?
you do not toy with us ?
let him be
curious indeed
that look on kondo' s face
i didn' t think he was so inclined
not eighteen and teaching ?
i remain unseasoned
no , i was impressed by the skill i witnessed earlier
you' re a fine swordsman
you' re tashiro ?
times are ever more troubled
i trust you would sacrifice your lives for our government
i' d like kano for my page
any objections ?
no , that' s fine
it is customary
and tashiro ?
what ?
fine .
tashiro will learn our ways in the first unit under
okita
so be it
oh yes , seijuro muto , of the
forth unit is to die tomorrow morning
shall i order one of those two to the task ?
toshi ...
let' s try kano ...
gohatto forbidden
to violate the warrior code
to renounce the shinsengumi
to borrow money without
leave
to bring personal suit
to engage in private
quarrels
offenders shall
disembowel themselves
kano
yes
tomorrow morning a member of the fourth unit
seijuro muto , a free lance from mino is sentenced to die
we have evidence he borrowed from a merchant , claiming he was on company business
we have chosen you for his executioner .
you accept ?
yes
no doubt the protocol is familiar .
if not , ask someone
your control will observe
it is a great honour
i' d heard they assign executions to newcomers
why you and not me , kano ?
the company codes are fair enough but the military codes are severe
if unit leader falls in battle his entire unit must accompany him in death
absurd .
we' il never get out of here alive
they say the codes date from last year' s battle
you' re from kyoto
why did you join ?
kano
restless ?
without sleep you' il fail tomorrow
sozaburo
sozaburo
have you ever killed a man ?
have you ever known a man ?
i suspect he' s killed before
your forgiveness
he' s got courage
no , that' s something else
who comes !
i am tashiro .
the other new recruit
envious of the honour you' ve done my comrade , sozaburo
kano
i wanted a peek at his sword
spectators are forbidden at executions and suicides
i accept punishment willingly
five days behind bars
five days later
you' re free
return to the company
to whom shall i report ?
a director , my control ?
tomorrow will do
tashiro san
sozaburo !
oh , no .
in prison i kept calling , sozaburo , sozaburo
did you desire help ?
never .
i just calling out the sweet name of my beloved
too fast
why do you laugh ?
i see , you were lonely ...
i' il come to you tonight
don' t you like me ?
excuse me
will you cry out ?
or shall i summon help ?
cry to raise the dead , but
i' il sleep with you before i die
then withdraw
i see
i' il take you to the gion , then
the gion ?
i' il treat you to a woman there instead
no women either
sozaburo .
you' ve never had a woman ?
life keeps no secrets within a month
kano has never known a woman
hey there !
hey , kano !
apparently , he is desired
specifically
takeda , the fifth unit leader
tashiro , the other freshman
kano evades tashiro
and yet , certainly the boy arouses attention
at eighteen , he keeps his beautiful locks
an open invitation to those so inclined
really , it is tashiro who deserves pity
soji
what are you doing ?
playing with the brats ?
yes , they' re catching me some little fish
which you' il ...
eat
soji
are you really better ?
i only suffered after the ikedaya incident
about tashiro and sozaburo
kano
oh , that ?
it' s really not for me
men chasing each other
during the competition , did you ...
what ?
who' s the tougher fighter ?
kano , definitely
hijikata san
what was kano thinking that day ?
he wasn' t thinking ...
it was the scent
the scent ?
of blood , you mean ?
bored as we stood watch at ikedaya , you wondered
when men scheme to ignite the capital and seize the emperor himself to hold captive in choshu
are such men mad ?
i did ?
they' re not mad they' re lucid
but when hot blooded men gather arguing for months on end over a fantasy they talk themselves into believing the government can easily be toppled
in that respect ,
shinsengumi is no different
such congregations exude a scent young men can' t resist
only the mad recognize each other ?
then you' re the madman in chief
kano here ?
yes
let' s go
i am in your debt
that' il do
tashiro !
don' t hold back , tashiro
weak
that' s the work of a certified swordsman ?
done
just as soji says
tashiro is clearly a lesser warrior than sozaburo kano
fight
that' s curious
these two are involved ...
so that' s how things stand
before long
sozaburo kano and tashiro are lovers
they' re coming
the shinsengumi' s coming !
that' s kondo san
shinsengumi , shinsengumi !
sozaburo
tell toshi ... ... the lt. commander to see me
they want me to escort them to choshu .
hiroshima , actually
so it' s war , then
no , a military inquest
why another inquest now ?
the occupation order was issued long ago
the other lords are hesitant and frankly , they lack funds
and , what can you do there ?
investigate choshu' s offence
no , i mean you
toshi
look after things
who will you take ?
ito san .
and i thought
takeda and ogata
ito san , huh
the company' s been unsettled since ito san and his philosophers joined us
i' il keep strict order while you' re gone
i' ve been informed , that
soza ...
that kano' s taken a lover
i wouldn' t know
in any case , it' s of no consequence
bother you ?
no
but it happened once before
lust swept the ranks like a fever , about the time of the
ikedaya incident
it seemed to infect everyone
it can' t happen again
extraordinary
you' re with shinsengumi ?
that' s right
to which school do you belong ?
pure land buddhist
no , i mean your sword
oh , my dojo
i trained in the same school as the young master and
toshi san but seem to lack the gift
i' m a lousy swordsman
then you are not a monk of this temple but a member of the company ?
sure , i' m with the company
i' m terribly ... excuse me
the look on commander
kondo' s face ...
who opposed him ?
i' m not at liberty to say
master okita
don' t call me master
how old a person ?
in his sixties , i would say
don' t be absurd
even commander kondo is only just past thirty
we have no old men here
but he said he was with the company and studied the sword ...
i know .
it must have been
genzaburo inoue
so grave an insult violates the code , you' il have to kill yourself
he' s by far our oldest member but not much over forty
you guessed sixty ?
i have no excuse
don' t worry .
it' s his own fault for looking so old
and he is ?
he' s master inoue ,
leader of the sixth unit
commander kondo , lieutenant
hijikata , old man inoue and i , all trained at the same kondo dojo which came to edo from the north
some members have accused us of dominating the company
that is not our intent
i understand
but inoue is right .
he is truly useless with a sword
when you spar with him , go easy
yet this advice proved fruitless
oh , you' re the one who inquired after my sect
no , i believe i inquired after your sword training
but please forgive the insult .
i did not recognize you
if you insist
little sectarian
i' m so busy
i' ve no time to coach you
but some day soon , we' il spar together
i am grateful
then , one day
oh , little sectarian
shall we have a go ?
yes
take this !
you call that sparring ...
how dare you !
pursue them !
did something happen ?
i don' t know
they were two .
ronin i' d say
the temple is vulnerable , but they were brazen
and , how did they taunt us ?
you call that sparring ...
unforgivable !
was that all ?
they said " is this the best
shinsengumi can muster ?
some members confronted them but mistaking them for guests watched them stride away freely
we bore such insults in the early days but now that the company arms maintain order none should dare to breach our garrison !
i have no excuse
i' il willingly accept any punishment
the fault is mine
no blame lies with master
inoue
bear up , kano
calmly await company orders
in the meantime , shall we have a go ?
identifying marks .
one has a battle scar on his left cheek .
his crest is the three stars
the other , in his mid twenties has an unusual crest .
it' s called the crossed battle
axes
crossed battle axes ?
a rare crest
no one' s sure , but they seemed to have higo accents
if they are from higo , they may be here to avenge the deaths of the men they lost at ikedaya
investigate
immediately
and who were the two sparring in the dojo then ?
inoue san and sozaburo kano
surely it was kano' s youth that drew the slander
inoue san
oh , toshi san
leave such work to your assistants
i do
but i get things so much cleaner
still , you must set an example for the men
is that so ?
and inoue san about the incident today
i' m sorry to have caused such inconvenience
no , no .
you are not at fault
but such brazen trespassers cannot go unchecked
it is for you and kano to take care of this little matter
it' s a job , then
by the way why were you coaching kano ?
well , the little sectarian ...
i' m the one who told kano to seek inoue san' s coaching
you did ?
the first drink is yours , sir
you' re my guest tonight
leave us awhile
we have secrets to discuss
kano .
why did you hold back with inoue san ?
i made no adjustment
yes , you did .
i was watching
as i watch all your sessions
your skill surpasses inoue san' s
you weren' t yourself today
that is not true
is it because inoue san a hared the commander' s dojo ?
no , i don' t blame you for holding back
we all restrain ourselves before them
and because of this , their authority flourishes
in theory , we' re equals but in fact they dominate us
the only alternative is flight .
but if you flee they kill you
as they did yamanami , who escaped this spring
he was one the founders , once a lieutenant beside hijikata
on the eve of his ritual suicide a woman clung to the bars of his cell , wailing her grief
such delicate feet ...
but , i digress ...
the point is ,
why do i watch you so closely that i recognize
your self restraint ?
kano , do you know why that is
why , is that ?
because i so desire to hear the bird' s first song after making love to you that i would pay for it by cutting my own life short
sozaburo ... grant me my desire
what about the servants ?
i' ve seen to them
don' t tell tashiro
meaning , you' re ...
involved with him ...
any developments , yamazaki san ?
inoue san .
sitting vigil again today ?
no word of three star or
battle axe ?
they don' t grow on trees
i' ve told you that your vigil only burdens us
yet you do not retire
we' ve scattered men around town to hunt them down even turned in likenesses to the magistrate' s detectives
we can' t quite order you to comb the streets as we have the pale faced sozaburo kano
does kano track three star and
battle axe with no clues at all ?
no , because their accents were of higo twice a day he visits the
ogawa inn popular with higo folk
sir
sir , may i ?
just in time .
follow them
yes
but where are you bound ?
i' il report to you at our post in gion , then
awaiting someone , sir ?
yes .
a company aide
this way
what will you do ?
go straight to the inn
at this hour ?
is it not prudent to wait for further intelligence ?
where i come from , we have a saying : do not wait to pull the weed .
in my village , the raccoons dry their coats under the crescent moon
that' s how highly raccoons prize their fur
is that so ?
i wonder about foxes ...
i wonder
at the temple in hino there' s a den of them
famous for their cleverness
sometimes they come to buy sake at the local shop but they always pay by coin
not with leaves ?
you' d think so
but they' re genuine coins of the realm , tarnished to boot
a clever bunch
a fellow named gen lived on the farm where hijikata was born short for genzaburo , like me
now this gen was master potato man
so much so that the villager they called him potato gen
when the local children came to play in the river nearby they' d steal his potatoes
when old gen died the children carried giant potato leaves to the funeral procession
the villagers mistook them for river sprites but i knew they weren' t
why ?
why ?
simple .
because i recognized the boy hijikata among them
it' s soji
why the get up at this hour ?
believe me , it' s hardly my choice
it' s your fault
my fault ?
inoue san
thanks to you , he' s off to die
to die ?
yes .
a short while ago , inoue san left for the ogawa
inn that den of higo men .
he only took kano
he means to die
impossible
but you know how he is
he wanted to right the harm he' d done
ridiculous
soji , gather reinforcements
i' il take two units at once
another thing ...
when you fight indoors , hold your blade as short as possible
meaning ...
grip close to the guard with both hands
don' t aim for heads that you may better avoid ceilings and door frames
as you learned at ikedaya
this way ...
short hilt ?
yes .
wait for your chance , then thrust
if your miss , repeat at once
that' s the trick but it' s hard to pull off in the heat of battle
open up
they look official
i figured they' d come the way they tailed us all evening
how many ?
i couldn' t see well through the lattice but i saw only two shadows
two ?
you go for reinforcements
i' il follow
i can' t believe two would attack alone
i' d say they' re ten
what' s all the fuss ?
patience now , i' m opening it
shinsengumi
why sir , what' s the hurry ?
move
let me guide you , see ?
please
come this way
please
up we go
see , there' s no one here
it' s warm
is that so ?
surely you imagine it
you think so ?
let' s try the back way
it leads to the river
madam , will you ...
what is it ?
i need to get to the river
what a lot of trouble
bring me a ladder and five lanterns
yes sir
why do you need the lanterns
there you are ?
i see
what do you say ?
have a look , little sectarian
anything amiss ?
seems not
then i' il lead
i broke my leg
state your allegiance
shinsengumi , here
kano
don' t give out !
kano !
you' ve come around , sozaburo
thank god .
i was worried
good , good .
can you make it ?
as the year drew to a close
commander kondo returned from hiroshima
that very evening there was a banquet
smooth
no sake equals kyoto' s
choshu han staunchly feigns
loyalty to the emperor and the government but trust me , this is a wolf in sheep' s clothing they mobilize behind our backs
the government is lax
unless it sends troops to
choshu' s borders occupies it and destroys its leaders there' il be hell to pay
but kondo san
last year , when choshu defied the cannons of the foreign invaders they pledged unanimous support for isolationism
the patriots of our land
lauded choshu' s stand
are you not an isolationist ?
i believe i am
surely then , you can afford to be more generous to
choshu
unfortunately , the barbarians had superior cannons
choshu' s coastal batteries were pounded to dust
and now , heaping insult on injury the government would suppress them
choshu is mortally wounded !
no warrior would attack now !
no warrior ...
ito san , do you suggest
i am not a warrior ?
yes , i do
a true warrior is defined by the strength of his compassion
simply said a warrior is merciful
you need not state it so baldly
most certainly
for during the course of our recent journey your understanding of my opinions deepened
hijikata san
it' s true , hijikata san
what' s true ?
i mean that ...
when commander kondo witnessed the state of things in choshu for himself his vision became broader than ever
no doubt out very tolerant
commander kondo is the only man who can control the chaos here in kyoto
is that so ?
hijikata san , what do you make of our current problem ?
not the slightest interest
excuse me
you return is the greatest gift
i thought you were laid up
no , i was too ashamed to face you but decided
i' d get it over with
did you hear ?
he' s heard the gist
how can i apologize for a blunder that cost us casualties ?
and your wounds ?
i only tumbled from a ladder
and kano ?
wouldn t want to mark that face of his
but why on earth were you coaching him ?
don' t tell me you too , are so inclined
i myself am not inclined at all .
and yet ...
and yet ?
perhaps i' m now a bit more inclined to incline to the feelings of those so inclined
oh , sozaburo ...
i' il not harm you
but tell me , do you love
tashiro that much ?
why ?
even though we' re involved you show no sign of breaking with him
break it off
i can' t
is he so insistent ?
not particularly
what is it ?
i' il kill ...
you ...
i wouldn' t
lieutenant , it' s control
yamazaki
what ?
can' t the matter wait ?
one of our men is dead
i' il rise
right here
the corpse was discovered at dawn .
the magistrate recognized our uniform and sent word
who was it ?
i' m going there now
a man in the tenth unit name of yuzawa
a regular country bumpkin
two mortal blows .
in the back and stomach
yuzawa , huh
why do i remember him ?
the killer ?
we do not know
retainers to the satsuma or
tosa are obvious suspects but in fact we have a witness
it' s easy to spot
satsuma or tosa
apparently , it was neither
which leaves us ... to think it was an inside job , then
did yuzawa have enemies in our ranks ?
i wonder
i' il investigate
perhaps ...
was yuzawa so inclined ?
so inclined ... meaning ?
a lover of men
given his birth he' d certainly be familiar ...
but with that face ?
the investigation yields no clues
i truly enjoyed myself
we' d better go
shall i bring some tea ?
about sozaburo kano
sozaburo ?
does he now belong to one of our men ?
who do you think it is ?
inoue' s jokes aside
dispose of the master , hijikata
dispose ?
you mean kill him ?
have you no mercy ?
kondo san , don' t tell me you' ve fallen in love with
sozaburo
toshi , you ...
you misunderstand
i did not say to kill him
i mean , for instance , have his
control , yamazaki , acquaint
sozaburo with the taste of a woman
first of all , why does he keep those locks ?
he' s old enough to cut them
i' il do my best
what is this weakness both
kondo and i feel for
sozaburo
you want me to take him to the geisha district ?
that' s right
with what funds ?
certainly can' t use company assets but given his family he can afford it
but for you ...
kano
control yamazaki ...
how are the wounds healing ?
ready for the face mask again ?
yes , i' m fine
that' s good to hear
then , let' s toast your recovery
say , tonight ,
let' s go down to shimabara
no , i ...
don' t stiffen up
it' s time you had a little fun
it' il improve your prowess with the sword
i' m engaged tonight ...
with whom ?
tomorrow , then ?
no , i ...
kano ...
it was no use
he resisted every inducement
inducement ?
yes
that' s a good one
what' s good ?
sozaburo' s probably scared you want to seduce him
outrageous
not even a possibility
it can' t be helped
as far as i can tell there' s no doubt sozaburo and tashiro are lovers
the late yuzawa , takeda , yomo .
many make advances
he must shudder , fearing that even his own control is after him
well , take your time
he' s still a baby
that' s no excuse
kano ...
kano ...
kano !
kano !
i have some business ...
fortune smiles on the
patient
in a month' s time
about the late yuzawa
yes
yes ?
he did approach me
so he also loved men
and did you consent ?
never .
of course not
who exactly are you promised to ?
no one
you' re not involved
there' s no question sozaburo and tashiro are lovers
but i like you
now , don' t misunderstand me
i' m not trying to teach you to love men
i' m taking you to a geisha so you' il learn the pleasures of loving women
lieutenant hijikata wishes it , too
for your own future
you think i have a future ?
don' t you think of the future ?
why would a rich man' s son study the sword and join the company ?
perhaps because i can kill
kano , come to shimabara tonight
master takeda did too
what ?
he approached you too ?
don' t mix me up with them
lt. hijikata , i wash my hands
consider it part of your professional duties
but ...
consider yourself lucky
control yamazaki
please take me to shimabara tonight .
i' m off duty
fine .
but let' s get this straight .
we' re going to
shimabara for the girls
i know
in that case , tonight
yes
oh , no you don' t
what is it ?
no , nothing
the girl should be gentle and kind
one of our better ones
no , your very best
our very best ?
listen , his father is the
kimono merchant .
owns
echigoya
oh , his son
you' ve heard ?
well , in that case he deserves shimabara' s finest
i see .
a merchant' s son beats a member of shinsengumi , does he ?
no , it' s the combination that' s invincible
and for you , sir ?
i' m just a chaperone
no woman for me
give me a room and some sake and i' il be fine
as you wish
did your sandal break ?
put your foot here
can you manage ?
yes , somehow
or shall i call for bearers ?
what ?
don' t even ...
hey , there
yes sir
we' re off to shimabara
i' il be back
why thank you
well , well , we' ve been expecting you
this way please
welcome
where' s the hostess ?
coming
some tea ?
not tea , sake
i' ve already spoken with your boss but about this guest
sozaburo kano
his tastes incline a bit towards men and besides this is his first woman
he' s nervous
coddle him a bit and look after things
i won' t stay long
his needs will be attended to
has commander kondo' s page
kano , returned to his quarters ?
not long ago
yamazaki san , it was a disaster
there was a terrible ruckus
i see
he never stopped asking for you and completely ignored the girl
we finally calmed him down and got him into bed but he wouldn' t so much as touch the girl
i' m so sorry
i think your guest came here to sleep with you , yamazaki san
can' t have that
why not ?
this evening , perhaps ?
absurd
just teasing
better still , why not let one of our girls cleanse your palette ?
no ,
i' m on duty late tonight
don' t mistake me
i' m shinsengumi , yamazaki
i' ve asked all the unit leaders to search the men for one who carries a hilt less dagger
it' s not mine
i wouldn' t be here if it was
i just heard from the first
unit .
tashiro' s dagger
is missing its hilt
tashiro ...
so i see
i put you in an awkward position
tashiro must' ve thought you' d stolen kano from him
making you a rival
i hear that such men feel fearsome jealousy
and you know , it was tashiro who first got sozaburo started
how dare you snatch him for yourself , eh ?
i didn' t snatch anything
i know that
i hear tashiro started out as a foot soldier
no , lower yet
he was a guard in the lord' s mansion
that' s where he picked it up
he' s a good fighter , but it' il be his downfall
so he must have killed yuzawa too
under the circumstances
i pity him but we cannot be lenient
execute him
he' s a madman of sorts
if we don' t stop him now who knows what havoc he' il reek
we' d become vulnerable
opportunists could exploit the chaos
but handle it discretely
then , his executioner ?
sozaburo kano , i think
but that' s ...
brutal
will kano alone suffice ?
he and tashiro are well matched
no , it must be kano alone
it may not work .
if he fails
kano may lose his life
we' il give him seconds
you and okita .
you' il do
me ...
not willingly ...
me ...
tashiro ?
i' il do my best
what can he feel ?
you' il be alone
yes
okita and i will observe
but even if your life is threatened , we cannot assist you
we' re only witnesses
yes
kano
why do you refuse to cut your hair ?
no particular ...
then cut it
please indulge me awhile why
i' ve made a vow
this will do
why is kano his executioner ?
it was kano' s choice
his reason ?
i don' t know
does kondo san fancy
sozaburo ?
kondo san' s not so inclined
you know that
but ...
but what ?
kondo san never looks at the others as he looks at
sozaburo
that' s ...
the same with you
me ...
sozaburo ?
soji , don' t tell me you' re jealous of sozaburo
you and kondo san rose me from childhood
there' s no jealousy in me
by the way , what about you and kondo san ?
meaning what ?
that there' s an unspoken pact that none shall come between you
that' s just how things are
but every so often , someone tries and kondo san may carelessly let him
then you kill him
soji , that' s enough !
i read an interesting book when i was ordered to rest in bed
it was a collection of strange , mysterious stories , called ugetsu
one was called
chrysanthemum vows
a pure but poor confucian scholar befriends an injured warrior
he takes him into his home and nurses him back to health
affection grows between them and not wishing to part , they take vows of brotherhood
a survivor of a defeated clan the warrior has one last obligation
promising to come back in the fall for chrysanthemum day he departs
time passes swiftly and the promised day arrives
rising early the scholar and his mother buy chrysanthemums , food and sake , and await the warrior' s return
but they wait in vain
putting his kindly mother to bed the scholar steps outdoors
the moon has slipped behind the hill , leaving him in darkness
as he turns to go indoors the scholar sees a man' s figure ...
it is the warrior borne on the wind
his heart leaps in welcome
but the warrior seems downcast , and barely utters a word touching neither food nor drink
suddenly he turns and says to the baffled scholar , " i am no longer of this world .
he' d failed miserably in his quest for vengeance
confined in his enemy' s castle , unable to escape he' d taken his own life to keep his promise
and become a spirit carried back by the wind
a fine tale
it is .
better to avoid frivolous entanglement .
in other words , involve yourself only with those you trust
but , in fact , i believe it' s a story about two men who' ve made a vow as lovers
why else would he go so far ?
taking his own life and becoming a spirit just to keep a promise ?
even the title suggests a vow between men
that' s not right
what ...
soji !
don' t tell me you' ve been in love with sozaburo
how can you ask that ?
you know
i' m not so inclined
i thought not
but then soji , why do you read such a book ?
read it , and then think such thoughts ?
truth is , i' m not sure
i dislike them
i dislike them both
i don' t like to see their faces
even the tone of their voices repels me
but i like beautiful stories
don' t you ?
here they are
you betrayed me
tashiro san there' s evidence that you killed yuzawa and ambushed yamazaki
i execute you on company orders
wait , what evidence ?
something' s wrong
sozaburo !
you killed yuzawa
and you stole the hilt of my dagger for yamazaki to find
forgive me
what did he say ?
i couldn' t hear
tashiro' s strength vanished what did sozaburo say ?
i couldn' t hear
but i doubt we' d understand it
no doubt words they shared in bed
there' s something
i' ve yet to do
i have to go back
soji ...
you didn' t love sozaburo but sozaburo loved you
that wretch !
he was too beautiful
as the men toyed with him he was possessed by a demon
