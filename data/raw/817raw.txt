i was happy ...
mm hmm .

i had a job , i had friends ...
i had a house ...
i had everything but
that steady bang , huh ?
she , " the squeeze , the girlfriend whatever you wanna call a chick .
yeah , right .
and then i met her ....
this whole thing started one night at mccools
the place was packed , even my cousin carl was there , and i was in the zone
everybodys got their power base pouring drinks is my speciality
i was puttin on quite a show for the frat boys at the end of the bar
awright , who wants to take the plunge ?
i want it !
awright , i know its only bartending , but hey , i m good at it
awright , folks , let' s go , wrapit up .
what a setup !
you must get laid like ... all the time .
oh , yeah .
the girls are linin ' uparound the block .
fuck , i knew it !
they just can' t resist a man working for tips in the service industry .
tell me !
gimme , gimme , gimme ...
y' know , carl , i appreciate your comin ' down here and gettin ' shit faced drunk , but
haaa !!!
don' t you think it' s about time you went home to karen and the kids ?

they got these long , long legged girls there , you can look at them and maybe touch them .
i gotta close up .
you think just ' cause i' m married

a woman after my own heart heh heh .
hun hun .
you have no idea what this woman is capable of .
i guess you don' t have to worry about that anymore , do you ?
i don' t think of myself as the kind of person who' s in this kind of office .
when i think about people who are in therapy , these are people who don' t have their lives in control .
i am i' m in control of my life , my life is is in control , that is not a problem for me .
what about the woman you mentioned ?
right .
uh ...
it started one night at mccool' s ...
its a kind of a low rent joint
ordinarily i would never be seen dead in a place like this
hey !
who wants to take the plunge ?
but on this particular night ,
karen had taken the kids to ohio to visit her mom
so i decided to dropin on my cousin , who i hadn' t seen in a long time
we re talking about an adult who thinks it' s fun to drink out of a toilet plunger .
i mean , this is the mentality we' re dealing with here .
let' s just stay focused on the woman , okay ?
right .
the woman , okay
well , i look across the room and i saw
... a very beautiful woman .
i hung around hoping shed come back , but she didn t
okay , time for me to go .
it was pretty late , and i d had a few drinks
and there she was
i' m just a little bit nervous .
how do i look ?
she was with this guy , and i thought maybe this is not the best time to hit on this particular woman
what is this , pms week ?
so i got in my car and
i don' t know , i started to doze off a little , and i hear all this screaming and cursing .
don' t touch me , asshole !
i' m gettin ' out !
hey !!!
wow .
tits .
fuck you !
and you didn' t try to help ?
oh , i would have .
but ?
i may have fallen asleep .
you should know
i was practically forced into this .
jewel ?
jewel ?
i , uh ...
i suppose it' s not gonna help
if i tell you that was really amazing ?
i know it was .
that' s the problem .
to tell ya the truth ...
i only took one psychology course in junior college ,
i know there' s supposed to be this thing where you' re sad or you' re guilty after ...
well , i personally don' t suffer from that .
it' s not that .
don' t you see ?
that guy tonight
oh oh , that creep in the firebird ?
i know that guy .
of course you know the guy .
let' s face it , you' re not the type of girl who just jumps into a car with some smelly guy that you don' t even know ,
i know that .
no ....
he and i are ... doing this ... thing .
oh , shit , i really like you .
what do you mean by " thing " ?
he and i get in this fight , and then you or whoever comes to my rescue and takes me home , and then ...
he like shows up and we rob you .
what ?
we rob you .
i mean , do you believe that ?
i' m shocked .
i i take it this is something that you you' ve done before ?
just a couple of times .
i know it sounds sick , but you don' t know utah , he' s nuts .
how does he know where we are , anyway ?
i' m supposed to call him and tell him .
you you haven' t done that yet , have you ?
of course not !
oh , good .
good ...
um ... okay .
i got it .
don' t call him .
let' s call the police instead .
not if you ever want to see me again .
oh , right .
y' know , i generally think better with my shoes on , so ...
this guy utah , is he a mormon ?
uh , i wouldn' t say that .
oh .
i didn' t think so .
you know , this guy ...
he sounds like a ma jor piece of shit , you know ?
you wouldn' t be talkin ' about me , would ya , loverboy ?
wh why didn' t you call ?
i was just about to .
has this guy got anything worth takin ' ?
old tv , a vcr .
he' s got a boom box , but only one speaker works .
a mr coffee machine .
telephone , um ...
oh yeah , and one light hooked upto the clapper .
hey , that was my mom' s .
shut your fuckin ' mouth !

you want me to open it ?
no , i want you to dance with it
move !
okay .
and if there' s a gun in there , just leave it .
' cause you' il pull it out , you' il get nervous , you' il wind upmiss in ' me , then i gotta do what i gotta do with what i got .
look at me .
look at me when i talk to you !
i can' t look at you and look at the safe at the same time .
oh , excuse me , okay .
you' re the big shot now , i' m nobody , right ?
okay , i' m over here now .
excuse me .
got any other features on this watch ?
it' s got a stopwatch .
it' s got a stopwatch ?
i never figured out how to use it .
it' s simple , it' s this button
oh ....
what happened ?
he was gonna kill you .
really ?
i mean , he was just
he could definitely tell that there was something going on between us , y' know ?
how ?
because i' ve never actually slept with any of the other guys that i' ve done this with before , that' s how .
is he dead ?
oh , jesus .
do you hate me now ?
no , no , no , no .
no .
oh yes , you do !
no , it' s not that , okay ?
it' s just the sex and the violence all in one night , it' s a little much .
what are we gonna do now ?
what ?
what are we gonna do now ? !
i don' t know !
well , think of something !
let' s call the police .
that' s a good idea .
yeah ?
yeah , really .
and what are we gonna tell ' em ?
we' il tell them the truth ,
i mean , that he was robbing you and and i shot him , and that' s that .
yeah .
tell ' em the truth .
i like that .
uh , since he was threatening you ,
i probably won' t get more than ten years , right ?
and with good behavior
i could be out in seven ... years .
wait ...
um ...
let' s come upwith another plan .
what ?
i mean , that he was robbing you and somebody else shot him ?
who ?
well , we could say that i shot him .
that won' t work .
it' s ridiculous , it would never work that way , it' s
well , maybe ...
well , i mean , let' s ...
let' s go over it .
okay .
he was robbing the place .
yes .
he did get shot , right ?
mm hmm .
so that' s two out of three .
what' s that , that' s sixty seven percent true ,
i mean , that' s pretty good these days , right ?
right .
that' s some first date , killin ' her boyfriend .
well , it gave the relationship a certain intensity .
it all started one night at mccools
earl raymond pitts .
had a list of priors goin ' back to the womb .
seriously .
he was born in dwight correctional .
his mother had twins while she was doin ' a bit for narcotics .
you mean there' s another one out there like him ?
huh .
yeah .
he went by the name " utah .
utah " ...
the mormon state ?
yeah .
don' t ask me .
i' m a little unclear on this .
he was holding a gun on you ,
but you were able to get your gun and shoot him point blank in the back of the head ?
yeah , right .
it it all happened kinda fast .
so ... he was standing in front of you , and then ... what ?
he heard something ?
right .
he turned around , you grabbed your gun ...
right .
which was where ?
uh ...
hidden next to the safe ?
right .
just in case something like this ever happened .
he turned around , you grabbed your gun , and pow !
exactly that' s exactly how it happened .
about what time was this ?
huh ?
about what time was this ?
oh , uh ...
just before i called 911 .
thanks .

nah , she was waitin ' for him back at their house , he didn' t show , she got worried , came here lookin ' for him .

what' s this ?
1 800 mattress .
i didn' t order any mattress .
dammit !
how are we supposed to pay for this stuff ? !
god , randy , i just thought we really had something , or at least the start of something .
but obviously i' m incredibly stupid .
you' re not stupid .
i' il be out of your life in just a few minutes .
i didn' t say i wanted you out of my life .
ha !
it' s just ... with the ironing , the the new mattress , they all just seem like things that are a little further down the line , that' s all .
further down the line than all the sex we' ve been having ?
any further down the line than killing utah together ?
you' re right ... you know what , it' s me .
i lost my job today .
you what ?
i got canned .
oh , baby , why didn' t you say so ?
aw ... are you okay ?
i guess .
oh ....
mmm ....
oh , your cousin called .
the lawyer .
we' re going over to his house on saturday for a barbecue .
so carl invites me over to his house for a barbecue .
now , carl never invites me over , so i' m thinkin ' to myself , why now ?
here you go .
that' s sweet .
thanks .
that is some ma jor league pussy .
ha ha ha !
i meant that in a good way .
you bangin ' her ?
she must have fucked you senseless when she found out you shot a guy ?
because i read that women cream for the violence .
i don' t know what that is .
when you' re fuckin ' her , though , because she' s so young , is it
i' m gonna see if they want some helpin the kitchen .
i' m just asking .
i mean , look at her !
it' s like havin ' a porn star in my house !
except she' s makin ' salad .
you have such a beautiful house it' s so homey .
that' s all karen , believe me .
i wanted to go with lots of stainless steel , something we could just pssh !
hose it right off .
a lot of this stuff we don' t even use , so if you really like it , take it .
thank you , jewel .
it' s always been my dream to have a real nice house .
i already know exactly what it' il look like
wall to wall carpeting with matching drapes , and a big , fluffy white couch , nice dining room set , and in the corner ... a fountain .
a fountain ?
it' s gonna be ...
it' s gonna be great .
it' s of a little girl washing her hair and the water runs off into a giant sea shell with goldfish swimming in it .
i didn' t just make it up , i saw it in a magazine .
better homes and fountains ?
carl !
hey , randy , you got a fountain in your place , don' t ya ?
in the living room
oh no , that' s a leaky toilet .
my mistake .
you know what , carl ?
you' re not funny just rude .
let' s get together some time .
that' s a good idea .
bye .
hey , c' mon .
mmm ....
okay , okay !
ha ha ha !
okay .
why don' t you let carl run you home ?
no , i' m afraid that' s where your luck runs out .
i can' t drive , i' ve been drinkin ' .
would you buy a car ?
one of these days .
make him buy a car , would ya ?
let' s go catch that 4 : 15 bus ,
let' s get the hell out of here .
buy a car
i wish he hadn t put that idea in her head
what' s this ?
oh , a friend of mine' s goin ' away for a little while ...
so she said i could borrow it .
well , what happens when your friend gets back ?
we' re gonna be used to havin ' a car by then .
so ?
then we' re gonna have to buy one .
so ?
it' s a bottomless pit of expenses !
you got in surance , you got repairs , car payments
you' re just afraid because now you don' t have an excuse for not finding work , aren' t you ?
stopright there , this has nothing to do with work .
did you know it' s safer to fly than it is to drive a car ?
you' re upset with me
because i didn' t bring you home a plane ?
another thing , if you think
i' m gonna be out there with a hose and a bucket of suds to wash the damnthing , you can forget it i' m not that guy .
well , fine .
i' il wash the car .
god , you' re full of shit .
what' s that ?
i' m full of shit ?
yes .
lemme tell ya i have seen people
leave the bar so drunk they can' t even see , and off they speed in their giant sports utility vehicles .
well , you run into one of these guys out on the street , and you' re gonna die , and you' re gonna die ugly !
would you relax ?
christ , look at this house !
uh ...
i come at a bad time ?
uh , no .
and then that damndetective dropped in
as if i wasn t stressed out enough
i' il let you two talk .
what' d he want ?
oh , you know , he' s a cop .
they' re never satisfied unless they ask you everything ten times .
after that night at mccool' s i was a mess .
i couldn' t concentrate ...
i couldn' t sleep ...
i could barely eat .
nothin ' deep fried , anyway .
i had this longing ...
something inside of me said i had to see that woman again
boy , was i glad i got there at that exact moment
he was getting very abusive
you' re gonna die , and you' re gonna die ugly !
it was like i had been chosen for a very special assignment
not by the department , but by a higher power
i was being sent to save her from him
oh ...
did i ... come at a bad time ?
uh , no .
didn' t seem possible , but she was even more beautiful than the night i first saw her .
and i said , good afternoon , then she said , i il let you two talk
then he said
not bad , huh ?
there was something about him i just didn' t like .
according to your statement , you closed the bar at one thirty .
you didn' t call to report the shooting until three fifty eight .
i need to know what you were doing during that time frame .
haven' t we already gone over all this stuff , man ?
hey , uh , jewel , how about crackin ' me open a brew , huh ?
i don' t know , it was , uh ,
i had to count all that money ,
it was a busy ass night , awright ?
i think on this night we had those frat boys in there , and a couple of ' em
whoa , whoa whaddya doin ' ?
this guy' s a cop .
he can' t drink , he' s on the job !
why don' t ya do somethin ' , y' know , make yourself useful .
all right .
i' il be outside was hing the car .
yeah , you do that .
man , i' m sorry about her .
how can i not question our creator for putting this ... ... human obscenity into the presence of such a ... ... divine creature .
anyway , that was the night we had all these frat boys in and they' re taking " the plunge .
a couple of ' em ended upin the bathroom and barfin ' up all over the floor ...
i wasn' t listening to a word he was saying
i could only think about her
i felt so guilty ,
like i was betraying the memory of theresa but i couldn t take my eyes off her
# well i think it' s time #
# to get ready #
# to realize just what i have found #
# i have been only half #
# of what i am #
# it' s all clear to me now #
# my heart is on fire #
# my soul' s like a wheel that' s turning #
# my love is alive #
# my love is alive #
# yeah yeah yeah #
# whoo ! ##
can you imagine how i felt ?
you should see what she does with my hose .
i don' t know what would make me invite him over for barbecue .
you did say you were going to .
hmm ?
yeah , but
i say a lot of things .
why do you think you did ?
i don' t know .
you tell me .
the woman ?
you know , he brings her and shes wearing this nothing of a dress , its a slip !
i mean , you can see everything
for a barbecue .
no , no , wait a second , what am i thinking ?
hot pants .
they re like cupping everything , and and this top
you could definitely see her stomach
wait !
no , no no sorry , it was a dress .
it was a dress , like a , like a summer kind of farmer girl dress , you know ?
with like , cherries and plums and
okay .
little fruits .
shes walking and shes bouncing and the grapes and the melons , and they' re just ba boom , ba boom
that' s fine , thank you .
she' s so sexy , but pretty !
okay , all right !
no !
all right !
that' s enough !
i get the picture !
let' s just go on with the story .
so then
in any case , the reason i called you was you' re one guy i can trust in a situation like this .
i got a guy with a hole in the back of his head where the exit wound was ...
# oh were you just pleased to see me #
# as you all know #
# you better take care #
# treat me with respect #
# because love is rare #
# as you all know #
# you better beware #
# treat me with respect ... ##
um , would anybody care for another burger ?
i' il have a hot dog .
if you have one .
and then she grabs me and she says ,
lets get together sometime
so she was coming on to you ?
yeah .
it doesn' t surprise me , really .
it doesn' t .
no , ' cause
i mean , i don' t mean to sound full of myself , but ...
but what ?
you' re irresistible ?
women ... women find me attractive .
do you think i' m attracted to you ?
well , you' re a doctor , so i think you have that professional reserve .
but even so ,
i think i felt something when i walked in the office .
it' s okay , don' t worry about it .
you don' t wanna hear about all this .
no , no , no go on , go on .
you got the car , you' re feelin ' good about yourself again , and boom !
the sex picks up again , right ?
well , not exactly .
i was watchin a lot of cable
randy !
randy .
can we talk ?
sure .
what did you do all day ?
i' m watchin ' this norwegian movie again ,
maria marushka
it' s really good .
randy ..
i think not having a job is starting to get to you .
no .
it' s not having any money that' s starting to get to me .
well , that is why i think we need to talk .
with what they pay me at the store we can barely cover our bills , not to mention the new dinette set i want , or the window treatments i want in this room .
well , i' m sorry , there' s not much more i can do .
i mean , nobody seems to be hiring .
that' s why i went to mccool' s today and spoke to your old boss , joey .
what !
you didn' t go down there and and beg him to give me my job back !
of course i didn' t !
good .
but i am going to the moody blues with him .
what ?
tomorrow night .
he seems to think they' re the second coming , but they' re really not my cupof tea .
wait a minute !
why are you doing this ?
i' m doing this for us as a couple , randy .
and more importantly , i' m doing this for you and your sense of self worth .
huh ?
i think that you have a lot of anger towards joey , and that because of that , you feel less of a man because of his power to take away your livelihood .
you think i' m gonna have less anger and feel like more of a man if you start dating this guy ? !
no .
i' m suggesting that tomorrow night when you know he' s at the concert , you go to his house and you steal everything of value you can fit into our car .
you' re joking .
no .
i mean , come on , the guy fired you .
and he still owes you six hours overtime , right ?
i just don' t think he knows what he had with you .
you' re so wonderful ,
you' re the best bartender i' ve ever seen , by far .
you know , the way you worked those crowds , you really had ' em in the palm of your hand .
you know what you reminded me of ?
what ?
a rock star .
really ?
really .
i don' t know ...
i just ...
i don' t see myself doing something like that .
it' s crazy .
once we fence all his stuff , we' il make a pretty nice chunk of change .
look , forget it !
there' s no way .
absolutely not .
but you did it , of course .
yeah , i did it .
i knew joey would have a big cd collection
and i was surprised at all the other cool stuff he had
you know , jewel must have taken a few more psychology courses than me , because as crazy as i thought the whole idea was , as reluctant as i was to do it , by the end of the evening , i felt great
i still wonder how she talked me into it .
here' s a wild guess .
yeah .
that probably had somethin ' to do with it .
# i got money in my pocket #
# i' ve got lovin ' in the air #
# there is nothin ' that will stopme #
# and i really just don' t care #
# i just want to live my life #
# that' s the way it' s gonna be #
# and nothin' s gonna pull me down #
# ' cause you know that i believe #
# the sun' s gonna shine #
# shine #
# it' s gotta be love from the very start #
# it' s gotta be love from the very start ... ##
jewel ?
the indian stays .
i wasn' t gonna throw him away .
for a while there , we almost seemed like a normal couple
you re slammin it night and day , poppin ' your cork like a bartender at a mob wedding , then one day , like it always happens , all that good nookie turns sour on ya .
yeah .
what are you doing ?
oh , nothing .
trash .
ah ah ah .
randy , come on , we have to throw some things away .
but not my sno globes , come on !
can' t we just compromise and throw one sno globe away ?
jewel , these came from my mom .
see this one here ?
she brought it back from chicago .
see , it' s got the sears tower here , and this one here is very special .
ya see , my mom used to say that this was our house , and as long as i never broke it , we' d always have a place to stay .
i knew s he was only joking , but still ...
you' re a sick puppy , man .
so what kind of job do you have at this point ?
i hadn' t got one yet .
it was sort of an ongoing problem between us .
i 29 , i 2 9 .
i was offered the lunch shift at tgl friday' s ...
you lucky stiff .
i actually thought it was kind of a stepdown from unemployment , i mean ...
no , you got it , you won i 29 .
oh yeah .
um ..
uh , bingo .
we have a winner !
i gotta be honest with you , my young friend .
i' m leaning towards the girl on this one ,
i mean , she' s made your dump nice and livable , you' re gettin ' good action on the mattress ...
hold onto it till you cash out .
least you could do is make some money .
maybe you should be playin ' bingo .
that' s why ... we decided to do another ... you know , break in .
what do you mean , " we " ?
yeah , jewel and me ,
i mean , i' m no criminal .
i bet he' s got a dvd .
i' d love to have one of those .
whoa .
we' re going to montague' s , so i borrowed something from the designer section at the store .
i just think you might have overshot ,
i mean , even for montague' s .
really ?
yeah .
you know ... ... maybe we shouldn' t be doing this .
the burglary ?
yeah .
oh , randy !
joey' s is one thing , but this is something else .
would you be happier if we weren' t ?
sure , wouldn' t you ?
i' il show you what makes me happy .
these are all pictures from magazines , things i' ve saved .
things that i want in my house someday .
i' ve been carrying this thing around with me for years .
whenever i feel lonely or get depressed ,
i just add in a new couch or a new set of drapes and ...
i don' t know , just dream .
it makes me happy to think that someday
i might actually live in the kind of house that looks like it belongs in a magazine .
you want me to be happy , don' t you , randy ?
of course i do .
so who was it this time ?
just some guy
god knows how they met
they were going to some fancy restaurant , montagues
jewel was sure she could keephim there for at least three hours
it was a good thing , too , because it was gonna take a little time to clean this guy out he had everything
at first i couldn' t find his dvd player , and i really needed to , since jewel wanted one
so i went upstairs , and there it was
dvd !
bingo !
him again ? !
you gotta be careful when you say " bingo " in here .
not to worry , that was a false alarm .
sorry .
it was like some game show where they send you on a shopping spree
i found a nice new rolex much nicer than my old swatch .
unfortunately , this guy was i guess a midget
and then things started goin wrong
what' s this ?
this is the place where it all happens , baby .
come on .
mi casa , es su casa
greg !
i thought we were going out somewhere !
why go out , baby ?
we got it all right here !
best sound system you ever heard , a little hot tub , swimming pool ...
the gregster might even break out his secret stash of blow .
uh , greg ...
uh , i thought , uh ...
why don' t we just drive for a little longer , this car makes me so hot !
i' il leave the front door open if you wanna follow me , okay ?
greg ?
score !
oh , shit !
greg ?
greg ?
greg !!!
randy !
i had a feeling you' d find your way .
this is a nice house .
too bad you' re such a shit .
heh !
a little dirty talker .
okay , okay , come on , let' s talk .
why don' t we go downstairs and have a drink ?
i have a better idea , baby .
let' s talk after .
bitch !
come on , baby , come on !
get off me !
ha ha !
bitch .
you like it a little rough , huh ?
oh , yeah , you wanna play ?
we' il play rough .
we' il play very
ungh !
oh , my god , i don' t believe this .
what is it with you ?
everywhere you go , there' s a dead guy .
take the dvd .
take the dvd !
i' m not takin ' the dvd .
why not ?
well , i don' t know , it just does n' t seem right .
it was all right before ?
before there wasn' t a dead guy iyin ' on the floor .
y' know , i never saw a dead person till i met you .
the guy was trying to rape me , does that mean anything to you ?
now take the dvd !
i' m not takin ' the dvd !
don' t you want to live in the type of house that has a first rate home entertainment center , including a dvd ?
i already got his big screen .
i don' t see the difference between taking his big screen or taking his dvd i want that dvd .
' cause the big screen is already down in the car .
i get all dressed up ,
i get a friggin ' shiner ,
i don' t get dinner , and i don' t get the dvd
i didn' t care about the tv ,
i was just doin this to make jewel happy
but you didn' t take the dvd .
a local attorney was found slain this morning ...
i do not believe we were in that gazillion dollar house and we didn' t end up with a thing .
did you forget about the dead guy on the floor ?
no , i did not forget about the dead guy on the floor , but we' re not talking about him right now , we' re talking about the dead guy on the floor' s stuff , and he had a lot of stuff , stuff we could have taken if you weren' t such a chickens hit .
what' s that ?
so now i' m a chicken shit , is that it ?
yes , i believe that' s the technical term for what you are .
yeah , well , i' d rather be a chicken shit than whatever the hell is it that you are .
i' m the woman living with the chicken shit .
not for long .
yeah , not for long , that' s right , because i need a real man , someone i can count on , not a chicken shit like you .
ah , good , company .
thus far , police have no leads ...
it' s that cop !
aren' t you glad we don' t have a lot of stolen stuff iyin ' around now ?
you' re a genius .
hi .
morning .
thought you' d wanna know we closed the investigation on the shooting at mccool' s , no charges will be filed .
we' re gonna let you slide on the unregistered gun
' cause it was self defense .
thanks .
everything okay , ma' am ?
yeah .
sure .
those are some pretty nasty bruises .
huh ?
oh yeah , she had an accident .
accident ?
would you mind if i talk to her for a minute ?
sure .
alone ?
okay .
at the time , i was glad jewel was gonna talk to him
she knew how to handle the cops , what to say to get rid of em
she was good that way
whatever happened in there , she doesn' t want to talk about it .
that' s ' cause nothing happened .
what we do in these domestic violence situations is ask you to vacate the premises .
what domestic violence ? !
i will go to a judge who will issue a restraining order which means you are not allowed on this property
this is my house !
or within 100 yards of your wife until this matter is settled .
she' s not my wife !
that' s too bad you' d have more rights if she were .
you expect me to just walk away ?
if you don' t , i' m afraid i' m gonna have to arrest you .
you can' t be serious !
this this can' t i just talk to her ?
i don' t think that would be wise at this time , sir .
whatever she told you , she' s she
it' s not true , y' know , okay ?
hey , jewel , honey , could you come out here , please ?
i could still book you on the unregistered gun .
hun !
jewel !
would you be kind enough to tell the police officer that i didn' t hit you !
would you please tell the officer that i didn' t do anything to you ?
don' t make me use force , sir .
jewel !
jewel !
i couldn' t believe it
i was so pissed at her i thought i was gonna explode
well , i gotta admit , she' s not perfect .
not perfect ? !
she' s like this pure , delicate flower ,
i just wanted to protect her .
but , uh , she was living with another man .
that piece of slime ? he didn' t deserve her .
and you did ?
i don' t know .
oh , charlie .
i was totally cons umed by her .
my every thought was of her .
i was walkin ' around in a haze .
people talked to me , but i didn' t hear what they were saying
gregory potter spradling .
a lawyer at ragsdale , hersch & klein .
what did he do ?
do " ?
for a living .
lawyer .
ragsdale , hersch & klein .
it doesn' t make sense .
why would you go to all the trouble of stealing a big screen tv and leave a dvd behind ?
poor guy
the only thing goin through my head was her
everything okay , ma' am ?
yeah .
sure .
those are some pretty nasty bruises .
would you mind if i spoke to her for a minute ?
knock yourself out .
charlie , what is it ?
why would god fill me with this desire
if i wasn' t meant to be with her ?
sometimes some time apart is the best thing .
i could arrange that .
would i get to stay in the house ?
a temporary restraining order would keephim way for ... 90 days .
but permanently ?
you' d have to get a lawyer .
do you know one ?
yeah .
i know one .
she called you ?
yes i didn' t call her .
she tells me things are going badly with randy , so i thought maybe i could helpher out and introduce her to one of the guys in my office .
in fact , i did , i once introduced her to this other attorney ,
greg , who' s this ... ... guy who was murdered .
anyway , she just knew that karen and i were having problems .
were you ?
yes , you could say that .
sexual problems ?
hey , you know ...
okay , if you want to label it , yeah .
but i' m not saying it' s karen' s fault .
was it your fault ?
maybe it was karen' s fault .
was there sex between you and this woman ?
yes .
you want it now , lawyer boy ?
yes !
yes , please !
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
what happened there ?
wh why' d we stop ?
what ?
i need to ask you for a favor .
anything at all anything !
um hmm , um hmm .
i' m gonna need some legal advice soon .
you got it !
you got it .
you aren' t just saying that ?
you got it .
you want this ?
you like it ?
can you helpme ?
anything !
say it !
i will give you legal advice .
say it !
i will give you legal advice !
say ... it !!!
i' m saying , i will give you legal advice .
yeah ?
whooah !
she whipped you ?
yes .
with a whip ?
yes .
and you en joyed it ?
yes .
charlie i spent so much time going by her house , ifyou didn' t know my intentions were pure you d think i was stalking her
hello .
hi .
i looked for any excuse to go see her
i spoke to a friend of mine about helping you with keeping the house .
oh , good .
thanks .
i , uh , i just wish i had known a bit sooner .
see , i already sort of contacted this other lawyer .
well , if you' d rather use him
it' s just that i' m not sure if i can get my retainer back .
well , lawyers
they' il always try to find a way to screw you .
yeah .
well , i i better
i , uh  yeah ?
i was making some supper ...
if you' d like to ...
it' s nothing special .
surely this was the hand of god .
how do you mean , charlie ?
in an instant i was transformed from a broken man , made whole .
it was like theresa had been brought back to me
she even looked like theresa
the way she moved ,
the way she smiled
# her skin is like velvet #
# her face cut from stone #
# her eyes when she' s smiling ... #
can i helpyou with that ?
no thanks .
i' il be right back .
she even made linguini with tomatoes and onions
like theresa used to
linguini with tomatoes and onions .
jeez .
what' s that ?
oh nothing .
probably just a cat got into the garbage .
bread ?
thanks .
how come you never wear a uniform ?
i' m a detective .
sometimes i do , it depends .
i bet you look real good in it .
i couldn' t wipe the goofy smile off my face
i was so happy
because of her i lost my job ,
i lost my house ,
i' m an accessory in not only one , but two murders .
shh !
i couldn' t stopthinking about her
okay , maybe i wasn t allowed on the property , but that didn' t mean i couldn t keepan eye on her
and then she did something that sent me over the edge
i knew i had to do something something drastic to salvage what little i had left
i got the ten thousand .
bingo parlor , right ?
yeah .
the code is ,
i say , " it looks like we might get some rain " ...
we came upwith a code .
i said , " looks like we might get some rain "
yeah , yeah , i know this part .
yeah , right .
you slept with randy' s girlfriend ? !
i mean , it' s not like i never did anything for him .
he called and he needed ten grand , so i advised him for free ,
i advised him how he could borrow against that old crappy house his mom left him .
you' re missing the point .
how did you feel after you slept with your cousin' s girlfriend ?
he' s not even a cousin , really ,
he' s my uncle' s wife' s brother' s kid .
so he' s not a blood relative or anything .
did she ever call and ask for legal advice ?
no .
no .
i keepwaiting .
it' s like she' s teasing me .
i' m dying to give her legal advice .
i just seem to be thinking about her more and more
excuse me .
there' s a police detective here to see you about greg .
sure .
thanks .
sorry about the mess ,
i' m in the middle of changing offices .
how well did you know greg spradling ?
uh , not that well , we worked here for the last four or five years .
you were both upfor the same promotion , weren' t you ?
no , not
not really .
greg was a good guy
no disrespect for the dead
not really partner material .
so no matter who i' m talking to , she' s just she' s on my mind .
can you think of anything that might be useful to us in our investigation ?
sounds to me like he picked upsome rough trade .
who knows what happened ?
there could have been ... ... leather .
there could have been some bondage ...
maybe those spiky things ...
maybe some whipping .
could have been pretty kinky .
but we all know what that' s like , right ?
no sir , i don' t .
that' s how much she messed me up .
i mean , i' m being investigated for a murder , and all i can think about is her .
and the whip ?
yes .
there was another reason i went to see her that day .
something had come up at work
the shoeprints we found on winfield road turned out to be converse all stars , the same brand the boyfriend wore
and if he was there , there was a chance she might have been
i had the same sick feeling in my stomach that i had when i was waiting for the results to come back from the lab at the hospital
unfortunately , her print did match one at the murder site
that scum , that boyfriend of hers
there' s no telling what he forced her to do before i came along i wasn' t going to let her get dragged into a murder investigation
i knew she had nothing to do with it
there' s something i have to ask you .
is it an inside question or an outside question ?
there was a burglary last week on winfield road .
a man was killed .
was she able to convince you that she didn' t have anything to do with it ?
she was very convincing
it was a miracle !
# the way you move #
# your sexy body #
# it makes we want to get to know you #
# a little bit better . #
sex ? !
oh
there was sex ?
god helpme , it was wonderful .
no , for me to helpyou ,
i i need to hear everything .
see , you have to tell me all about the the various acts of physical congress between
i already told you that .
okay , no , that' s fine ,
i' m not it doesn' t
i shouldn' t have done that .
it' s okay , i wanted to .
are you going to arrest randy ?
i' ve got a warrant out for him now .
that car he' s driving is stolen .
add a murder charge to that and you won' t see him for a long time .
so i' il get to keepthe house .
this ...
this is all i have left .
how not perfect can one woman be ?
aces in the boink department .
got yourself a snazzy new watch .
like this is supposed to make everything better ?
but you gotta admit , that' s a beaut .
here' s the money , just take it .
take it .
take it !
shh !
kid easy , easy .
would the owner of a blue geo metro
missouri license plates 87kp03 please report to the front desk .
is that my car ?
you got any idea what they want ?
no .
is there any possibility that she might have
stolen ?
yeah .
i want to remind everyone that saturday is " hawaiian night .
she gave me a stolen car .
women are much more complicated than we think they are .
c' mon , let' s get out of here .
we' il get back to the game as soon as the troopers finish their business .
sir , is this your car ?
that piece of shit ?
officer , what do i look like ?
you know , to tell you the truth , she doesn' t sound worse than most of ' em .
but you' il do it , right ?
business is business .
# a wanted man in mississippi #
# a wanted man in old cheyenne #
# wherever you might look tonight #

oh , the flesh is weak ...
but ours is a forgiving god .
but i destroyed evidence
i withheld information for a murder investigation
charlie , look
you deserve some happiness .
the kind of happiness that a ... ... a good woman can bring a man .
oh ...
yes , i have this great job and this great office and this great family and this great house
how does this make you feel ?
empty .
i feel nothing .
and who knows , it happened so fast .
i mean , here' s this guy in my office

i could walk out of your office and get hit by a truck .
i don' t want to live like that anymore .
let me just feel something , anything , and then i will look up and i will say ,
thank you , god .
thank you for that gift .
and ... then if the truck wants to get me , then okay .
and then i meet this woman .
she makes me feel ...
thank you .
oh ...
i' m sorry .

he calls himself jewel' s boyfriend !
i' m warning you .
where is she ? !
i was expecting her here any minute !
why do you think i' m dressed like this , for halloween ?
you' re dressed like that because your perverted cousin
wait a minute .

you are violating a restraining order and are under arrest !
you don' t understand .
someone is coming here to kill her !
him ?
huh ?
no .
which one of you homos killed my brother ?
i' m not gay
shut up !
i understand the man that killed my brother , utah , he lives here .
and i' m not leaving ' till i kill him .
now , which one of you was it ?
i said , which one of you was it ! ?
i i i' m an attorney .
i' m sure you and your brother were very close that' s good .
avenging his death , wanting to avenge his death , that' s admirable , who doesn' t understand that ?
but as a lawyer ...
what the hell ?

looking through the window of my house ?
give me your gun .
i lost my dog , uh he came off his leash .
and you need a . 357 for that ?
well , it' s a rough neighborhood ... ...
jewel .
you should know that .
look at these guys .
legally , you' re swimming against the current here , but you' ve got think about the fact that if you kill all three of us , you will be adding here , and i' m just guessing , a second and possibly third strike to your record .
which would be heading you to some very serious prison time .
you i' il kill just for annoying me .
now , i would appreciate if the man that killed my brother utah would stepforward and take responsibility for their actions , or i will have no other choice than to kill all you dan ... ... village people !
now ... somebody better damnwell start talkin ' !
aaah !!!!
aah !
lord , please don' t let them find me in this outfit !

nothin ' i like better than stayin ' home on a quiet night watchin ' a good movie on my dvd .

if you' re gonna have a first rate home entertainment center , you gotta have a dvd .
not that my place doesn' t need some fixin ' up .
hell , i was even thinking about putting in a fountain .
