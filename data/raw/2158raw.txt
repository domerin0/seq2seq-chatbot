your death is in your throat !

riccardo broschi ... this introduction is unworthy of what i' ve taught you .
maestro porpora , please !
you cannot judge his score ... until you' ve heard at least the first part sung .
these two ... were made for each other .

this " joint creation " by ... your two sons , signor broschi .
that' s what you want , isn' t it ?

let' s go , carlo .
this fellow seems ... to be missing a thing or two !
carlo , please !
stay calm .
let' s hear it for the trumpet player !
surely here ... in the land ofmusic ... there must be a singer who can take on my trumpeter !
he' s my brother .
hey , you !
what' s your name ?
he mashed your famous trumpet player into farina !
farinelli !
the show continues , ladies and gentlemen !
the show continues .
fill up the basket !
signor farinelli !
signor farinelli !
what do you want ?
this isn' t the time !
go away !
a message from handel !
hurry up !
a message from handel !
i want young farinelli to accompany me to england .
i wish to hire him for my theater in london .
well ?
what does young farinelli think ofthat ?
young farinelli " ... wonders why the maestro thought of him ?
you amused me .
your duel with the trumpet was very entertaining .
well , i' m waiting , farinelli .
what sum did the maestro ... have in mind to secure the services of the broschi brothers ?
i' il only take the youngster .
if he works hard ...
i may give him a contract .
i' m afraid you don' t understand , maestro .
contract or no contract , the broschi brothers stay together .
i have to buy them by the pair ?
i am a composer , maestro .
dear god !
farinelli sings what i compose ... especially for him .
he sings just about anything .
i don' t quite understand .
anything at all .
that' s what i said .
he sings just about anything .
don' tyou see that in his hands ... you' il never be more than a sideshow attraction ?
do you have so little regard for music ... that you' d waste your voice singing rubbish ?
without music , you don' t exist .
you' re just a creature without balls .
neither man , norwoman .
your voice is the only justification ... for your existence .
in here ... there' s merely an organ that nature lets you enjoy ... so you' il forget how ridiculous that one is .
may god forgive me !
some years later
riccardo .
why do you keep saying " riccardo " ?
i' m almost finished .
wait .
you' ve been rewriting act two of " orpheus " for ten years !
will he ever get to the underworld ?
wait .
is it really finished ?
well , finished
finished uh , finished
it needs more work , but you' il see ... the flourishes are diabolical !
you' il have to go without inhaling for at least one minute .
i can manage one minute .
give it to me .
all right .
try it .
sing !
are you crazy ?
what are you doing ?
it still needs much more work .
devil !
you traitor !
don' t be crazy , brother !
orpheus " is a beautiful creation !
you' re crazy , brother !
orpheus " !
listen to them , carlo !
you hear ?
it' s a triumph !
we' re the greatest , carlo .
if father could see this !
if he could see all this !
last night i dreamt about him .
he was in this theater .
he was here , carlo !
he was right here !
he cried tears of happiness !
tears of happiness .
he was so proud of us .
you were marvelous !
please , leave me alone .
i' m not feeling receptive .
one should seize the moment !
do you realize how arousing you are ?
it is hoped that you' il accept this .
and read this letter .
tearing countess mauer away from her book ... is something only you could accomplish .
that' s a very valuable gift , signor farinelli .
i' il leave .
silk ... satin ... velvet .
ah castrato !
it' s the pact , madame .
i' ve always believed , signor farinelli ... that books could supply our minds ... with all the necessary sustenance .
as to the feelings the arts inspired in me ... they always appealed to my highest faculties ... to my intelligence .
those feelings , signor farinelli , i can control .
but what i felt yesterday evening when i heard you sing ... is beyond my understanding .
what you aroused in me ... is very similar to a feeling of love .
i believe ... that ... you were responsible ... for my first musical orgasm .
at this point , signor farinelli ... do you really need your brother ?
do you need him in order to get an erection ?
can you come , in spite of what they took from you ?
they left me enough to satisfy all the world' s women .
what is it like ?
stupendous .
and safe .
never safe .
carlo supplies the climax .
riccardo plants the seed .
together ... the broschi brothers are formidable ... and a perfect team .
sing for me , castrato ... just once more .
better ask your husband or your lover for that , madame .
the venice contract .
the bologna contract .
carlo , we' re invited to vienna !
for you .
handel !
what does he want ?
what does he want now ?
he' s coming to dresden to hear me .
oh , really ?
he won' t hear you .
we' re not going !
this one' s from porpora .
carlo , what' s wrong ?
carlo ?
my voice .
it' s gone !
that' s impossible !
it' s gone !
carlo !
stop !
don' tjust stand there !
put the wood on the fire .
quickly !
in the fire place .
these people don' t understand anything !
faster !
hurry up !
carlo , eat .
you have to eat .
you have a fever .
tell me about it again .
don' t start again .
it does you no good .
that nightmare keeps coming back .
it haunts me , riccardo .
it' s like an endless race .
i never fall off .
if i could just dream that i fall off .
help me .
i' ve already told you a hundred times .
tell me again .
when our father died ... you became very ill .
one day the fever was so high ... you were delirious .
you went to get helios .
that horse was a demon .
something occurred between you two .
he always led you toward danger .
off you went on that terrifying ride .
i got there too late .
you had already fallen off .
carlo .
carlo .
we did all we could to save your life .
to save my life .
to save your life !
a little opium .
yes , some opium , and i' il sleep .
opium makes you delirious .
we have to go to dresden .
we will .
handel wants to see us ?
handel wants to hear us sing ?
we' il go to dresden .
we' il show him ... what the broschi brothers can do !
if i could sing " orpheus "
that' s impossible , carlo .
it won' t be ready yet .
you know that very well .
you know it .
you' il never finish it .
i' il never sing it .
will you speak to me today without a middleman ?
what grandeur !
what poise .
seeing you like this , i understand your irresistible rise .
it' s been a long time since i heard you sing .
as the king of england' s envoy , i had to
am i distracting you ?
his majesty will do anything to have you at covent garden .
he has a passion for singers ... and snuff boxes .
to be brief ... the king wants to add you to his collection .
at any price .
and you , maestro , do you need me ?
they say your voice is exceptional .
if you manage to arouse the slightest emotion in me ... with this awful jumble of notes ... then you' re the world' s greatest singer .
you still have to prove to me ... that you' re more than a singing machine .
give me what none of your kind has ever managed to give me .
and to answer your question ...
i need nobody , farinelli , nobody .
you' re sweating .
it' s ruining your makeup .
i' il come for your answer after the performance ... in your dressing room .
we' il talk things over .
signor broschi !
how is he ?
he' s asleep .
i must see him !
i' il wait all night ifnecessary .
what do you want ?
i really have to speak to him .
it' s urgent .
i' m here .
no , i' m sorry .
my message is not for you .
it' s for signor farinelli in person .
in person ?
in person .
i' il come ... for your answer ... in your dressing room .
where is he ?
who ?
maestro handel .
where is he ?
the performance was canceled .
he left like everyone else .
he was supposed to come .
who are you ?
alexandra .
i' m alexandra lerris .
but you don' t know me .
i' ve brought you a message ... from maestro porpora .
he' s desperate .
he needs you .
do you hear me ?
do you hear me ?
look at me .
since he took over the nobles theater , he' s fought hard .
but he' s being ruined by the king' s and handel' s theater .
his competition has an unfair advantage .
he needs you , farinelli .
he does .
you must help porpora .
come to london .
come help him .
i' m afraid he didn' t hear you .
it' s the opium .
london , 1734
try this wine , signor farinelli .
i have it sent from france from the vineyards ... that i inherited from my father .
would you kindly look in my direction ?
i know i look frightening , but i' m really quite nice .
forgive me .
how old are you , child ?
how strange .
child " is what my mother calls me .
i' m 12 .
but i' m really much older .
that' s the big advantage of being ill .
my name is benedict .
but i' m not " blessed " at all .
would your singers defect to covent garden ?
sell themselves to handel ?
all' s fair in the war between our theaters .
and the singers know it .
some of them extort a fortune from us .
i suspect handel encourages such blackmail .
i doubt that he' d meet their demands .
although the king supports his theater ... he' s almost as broke as we are .
is my nose out of place ?
why are you staring at me ?
i admire your nerve , madame ... in daring to defy handel .
women are very strong , signor farinelli .
men' s weaknesses make it necessary .
bravo !
fantastic !
what is that ?
put those flowers away .
you look ridiculous .
alexandra , there' s his brother .
beware of riccardo .
they say that the broschi brothers ... share everything , even their conquests .
i know i' m late .
but you' ve provoked such an uproar .
here we are , alone , while all of london clamors for you .
carlo , dear brother , you' re crazy .
but i love you .
when i said you wouldn' t attend the reception , it was as if ...
i' d announced the end ofthe world !
i' m flattered , carlo .
flattered and moved .
yes , yes .
i' m moved .
and dying of hunger and thirst .
let' s drink !
tonight i' d like to have every woman in the world .
marvelous !
it' s been too long since we shared a real brotherly meal .
porpora is overjoyed .
nobody attended handel' s theater this evening .
he had to cancel the performance .
all of london was with us at the nobles .
to listen to us , carlo , your voice ... and my music !
i love you , carlo .
and my new opera ... will make history .
it' s shit !
what ?
you heard perfectly well .
then why all this acclaim ?
are all these people wrong ?
why did they applaud ?
what' s wrong with you ?
you' re never satisfied .
all europe is at our feet .
what more do you want ?
what' s wrong , carlo ?
talk to me , carlo .
don' t worry about a thing .
you were magnificent .
it' s completely unnoticeable , believe me .
just a tiny tremolo .
so tiny that it only happens in the very highest appoggiaturas .
nobody noticed it , i swear .
i spotted it a while back , but are you feeling better ?
you hear that , riccardo ?
after all , you' re not deaf .
you substitute virtuosity with inspiration .
all those embellishments and flourishes ... all those adornments ... that you heap on to your scores !
i invent them for your voice .
forget about my voice !
i can' t .
you know i can' t .
i promised our father .
better think about the music .
it should touch the heart .
find the true , essential feeling .
i want your music to rouse that fragment of the infinite ... that lies asleep in their bellies .
that' s what i ask of you .
such ingratitude !
what about " orpheus " ?
orpheus " !
orpheus " doesn' t exist .
you' il never finish it .
i don' t lack inspiration .
i lack the time !
you take all my time .
all of my time !
rise , signor farinelli .
permit the prince ofwales to pay you homage .
the nobles theater is eternally grateful to you ... for saving its honor , as well as the honor ... of this country' s nobility .
my voice is at the service of music , your highness .
your voice ...
signor farinelli ... attracts the most discerning audiences .
and despite the support of his majesty ... you' re stealing from handel his last remaining listeners .
not that we' re displeased !
what do you mean ?
these operas handel composes in three weeks ... are an insult to his audience .
who spread this slander ?
rumors .
rumors that you stop to peddle , sir !
have you heard these operas , sir ?
you' re joking , young lady .
that would be treason .
we never attend covent garden .
i have heard them .
they surpass anything one hears anywhere else .
i can' t imagine handel' s work surpasses maestro porpora' s work .
or that of signor broschi .
you' re an ass , sir .
you don' t deserve to have ears !
long after posterity has forgotten ... that you ever lived ... it will preserve handel' s name with infinite respect .
your conceited attitude ... is an insult to all musicians .
i' d like to erase from my memory this cursed day ... when i sang for you !
you' re cheating , carlo .
he always cheated .
he can' t stand to lose .
neither can i.
but i don' t cheat .
i taught you how to sing , carlo broschi .
don' t forget that i was your teacher .
don' t add ingratitude ... to your insolence .
say something .
what is he thinking ?
he' s decided to humiliate us with his scorn .
we' re wasting our time .
tonight the broschis have decided to remain silent .
i hardly knew my father .
it was i who asked to hang his portraits throughout the house .
my motherwas afraid she' d suffer .
but actually , it helped us .
i no longer have a father .
and you will never have children , right ?
it' s the greatest sorrow of my life .
marry my mother !
let us choose each other .
you' il be my father , i' il really beyour son .
i know the church forbids castrati to marry .
but my mother is not a catholic .
i know that she' s really very lonely .
i' m very touched by your suggestion , benedict .
i thank god for the love you bear me .
god has nothing to do with it .
it' s a private gift .
let' s not stay here .
what are you doing here ?
let' s go , please .
were you following me ?
it' s not the first time .
what i just did put us in grave danger .
here , read it later .
how did you get this copy ?
it' s no copy .
it' s handel' s original score .
i stole it for you .
my legs are still trembling .
you' re insane !
yes .
you' ve been singing broschi for too long , haven' tyou ?
you' re starving for music worthy of your voice .
now it' s in your hands .
you need your brother even for a kiss ?
where were you , carlo ?
i' m talking to you !
you shouldn' t be out in the cold .
it hurts your voice .
why is she here ?
we' ve been waiting for you , carlo , with great impatience .
you' re disheveled , young lady .
did my brother give you what you expected ?
you didn' t answer my question .
calm down .
a night with her will do us both good .
i don' t want to .
have her taken home .
let me have her .
don' t break our pact .
let me .
i need her .
i wouldn' t advise it , carlo .
you' re good at two things , carlo broschi .
betrayal and loneliness !
we no longer need each other , castrato !
castrato !
i beg you to stay .
i' m sorry .
without him , it' s no good .
to your health !
my dear margaret !
will you marry me ?
i' m afraid you didn' t hear my request .
i heard it perfectly , my friend ... and i thankyou for it .
forgive my laughter .
it was a stupid defensive reflex .
it' s a mistake , carlo .
i will never marry again .
i owe benedict' s father that last fidelity .
you need no further excuse than the horror i inspire in you .
oh , no !
but i am too aware to share your blindness .
probably because i often play god on stage ...
i dared to think i could be a man .
forgive me , both of you .
it' s impossible .
i cannot .
come , benedict .
you' re tearing me apart , carlo .
to protect my love , i must crush my feelings .
to hell with those rats !
i' m so tired .
i am so tired !
too much pride .
don' t despise your music , maestro .
who let you in ?
don' t resist .
follow the thread of my voice , like a musical progression .
i only want to talk .
where did you get that ?
it doesn' t matter .
i came to offer you this music .
how dare you ?
i' il sing it for you .
sing it for me ?
it' s time we made peace .
we both had the mystery revealed to us .
music belongs to me just as it belongs to you .
what music ?
good enough to squeeze cheap tears from females who swoon over your voice ?
is that how you presume to move me ?
with your music , i will .
because of you , and to save this theater ...
i exhaust myself composing works unworthy of my talent .
you' re causing my music to deviate from its course .
i' il never forgive you for that , farinelli .
a castrato' s voice is an example of nature abused ... rerouted from its goal , in order to deceive .
you' ve subverted your voice to virtuosity without soul ... devoted only to artifice !
let it stay there !
give me back my score .
you know , maestro ... some people say that my singing ... has power over people .
don' t turn my voice into an instrument of death .
you don' t frighten me .
everyone knows that farinelli promotes his own legend .
keep on splitting their ears ... with stupid operas full of idiotic characters !
is that him ?
yes , it is .
you see , carlo ?
i' m happy .
my body doesn' t refuse to grow . are you in pain , child ?
it' s not really pain .
just a feeling of utter fragility .
like a snail without its shell .
alexandra has the world' s softest hands .
but i won' t share them with anyone else .
delightful !
quick , cover it up .
we' re helpless , alexandra .
but one thing is certain .
you love me , don' tyou ?
where is my score ?
where does your brother hide the opera he stole from me ?
tell me ... and i' il leave you in peace , like a rat in your attic .
thieves !
you' ve stolen my brother from me , maestro .
your music ... separated us more than any ocean could have .
who composed this ?
play it .
go ahead !
neither excessive ... nor unnecessary flourishes .
it doesn' t seem like you .
this is an entreaty .
the harmony should be changed .
take this supplication into the dominant .
move over !
after the major third ... repeat the theme up a fourth .
your brother is a monster .
play !
go ahead !
this is weak .
not enough violence !
wait .
expand the chord ... and dare a chromatic move to d flat .
not bad .
not bad at all !
who does he think he is ?
god ?
he' s destroying you ... and wants to destroy me , too .
bring me the rest .
some ink , pens , wine .
what are you waiting for ?
when did you plan to finish it ?
when did you start this ?
when ?
the day when
the day my brother was castrated .
that day , i promised him ... it would be ... our joint masterpiece .
you' il never finish this opera .
never !
you no longer have any reason to finish it .
he doesn' t need you anymore .
it is you who needs him .
you' ve been deprived of your instrument , signor broschi .
you' re like narcissus without his reflection .
like orpheus without his lute .
you' re right , maestro .
without him , your music no longer exists .
without him ... you are nothing but silence .
at 17 ...
i composed my first melody .
i wrote it for carlo .
you may be the only one who can understand .
his voice
his voice was sublime .
and my music flowed from my brother' s throat .
when did he fall off that horse ?
he never fell off .
when father died ...
carlo became seriously ill .
my father had entrusted him tome .
he was delirious .
i was afraid of losing him .
is oothed him with some opium ... and by telling him the story of an opera ... that i invented day after day to help him dream .
he loved to sing , maestro .
he loved to sing .
his face
his face was transfigured when he sang .
that angelic voice had to be preserved .
it had to be done quickly .
opium eventually wears off .
his voice had to be kept from being ruined ... by the repulsive alchemy ... that time inflicts on the body .
my music unified us , maestro ... closer than lovers .
do you realize the scandal we will create ?
a handel opera performed at the nobles theater !
it' s unheard of ! .
incredible !
how could i have let all this happen ?
finally , farinelli ... what renderedus enemies for so many years ... will be resolved tonight .
it' s time to settle our account before god .
do you remember the opera ... that your brother promised you when you were boys ?
do you remember , farinelli , with what emotion he spoke of it ?
did you ever ask yourself ... whether it was to soothe the pain of your castration ... or to still his howling conscience ?
it' s time you faced the truth ... that has haunted you since childhood .
why do you refuse to hear what you' ve known all along ?
it' s to this brother who had you castrated ... that you dedicated all your talent .
and to perpetuate this brotherly pact ... you spat in the face of handel .
you managed to turn me into what you' ve always been .
you castrated ... my imagination .
starting now , i' il never compose another opera again .
never again !
you are the first to know ... and the only one to blame .
ask god for the strength to continue ... and to sing , without wavering , the music you stole from me ...
farinelli .
come on !
carlo !
come outside !
let' s see you , carlo !
you' ve no right to reject me !
i' ve looked for you for three years !
come out !
i' ve looked for you everywhere !
carlo !
carlo !
answer me !
you' re a broschi , carlo , just like me !
you can' t have forgotten .
that' s impossible !
carlo , come on !
our opera !
i' ve finished it !
carlo , i' ve finished it !
i composed it for you !
orpheus " !
orpheus " !
here it is !
come on , carlo !
carlo , come out !
do something .
i know you' re there , alexandra !
don' t take him away from me !
don' t take him away from me !
do you want to kill me ?
is that what you want ?
without me , you' d be nothing .
i created you .
farinelli !
i created you !
castrato !
castrato !
castrato !
carlo , please !
he' il go crazy !
tell him you love him .
go ahead .
go .
i can' t .
your brother needs you , and so do i.
i need you , too .
do you hear me ?
i sacrificed everything for this love .
i know it' s senseless ... but i love you .
i don' t want to lose you .
i don' t want to lose you .
three years , carlo !
three years !
i knew it was you .
it' s very beautiful .
really ?
you really think so ?
it' s your most beautiful composition !
it' s what i always waited for .
we could work on it together .
perform " orpheus " here in madrid .
everyone will love it if you sing it .
your brother no longer sings , riccardo ... except for the king .
and maybe for you ?
it' s strange .
there' s something in your face when you suffer ... that' s poignantly reminiscent of your brother .
that must be why i can' t really hate you .
do you know how much i' ve suffered , writing our opera ?
you' re telling me about suffering , riccardo ?
you ?
can' t you see , i' m asking for your forgiveness ?
haven' t i atoned for enough ?
i don' t think so .
never enough !
is the earth simply a tomb ?
bring back the sun , farinelli .
riccardo !
riccardo !
my beloved brother .
it is without much hope that i' il search in distant lands ... amidst the clashes of war ... for emotions as intense ... as those i derived from music .
at this moment , carlo ... with my heart heavy from leaving you ...
i' m giving you back what i had taken from you .
your share of humanity .
i' ve burned our opera .
that music and the past ... are irrelevant today .
but what i am leaving with you , carlo ... is that not also ... our joint creation ?
