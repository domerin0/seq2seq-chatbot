through all the parishes , including morgan city and the whole basin .
the temperature' s 88 degrees .
tonight , winds from the southeast bringing in isolated thunderstorms ... ... clearing by morning .
tomorrow' s sunrise is at 6 : 05 , setting at 8 : 08 .
in between time hot and sticky with a daytime high of 87 .
it' il feel lik e 97 with humidity crawling up to 88 percent .
and now back to louisiana' s fav ourite music .
mr. sanders , i' ve reviewed your file .
over the past three years , you' ve been late on 14 payments .
yes , ma' am .
it' s ... ... a charter fishing boat .
a seasonal business .
on other occasions , i' ve paid a month in advance .
regrettably , there' s no provision in your loan for carrying that credit .
what' s that mean ?
it means just because you paid ... ... june in advance , we don' t waive late charges ... ... if you' re delinquent in october .
where' s morial ?
he' s the guy i deal with .
mr. morial has retired .
i' ve taken over his accounts .
mr. sanders , you have to make your payments on time .
yes , ma' am .
miss one more , we' il call your note .
take my boat ?
we will call your note .
how you respond to that is entirely up to you .
you know i can' t pay off the entire loan ... ... so i' m gonna have to find a buyer , not easy ... ... or you' re gonna repossess , right ?
it' s standard bank policy .
miss savoy ... ... i make my living with that boat , and i live on it .
i appreciate that .
you don' t .
i beg your pardon ?
lf you did ... ... you' d look at me as a human being , not just a signature on a bottom line .
make your payments , mr. sanders .
on time .
roger that .
how about that ?
what' s for dessert ?
what' s happening , rude boy ?
all fruits ripe , rick .
it looks like you' re in phat city .

i got to have what only bad brett can give me .
okay , lay it down .
yo , homey , what' s up with the shark ?
that' s my cousin , ice .

when you get my money , bust a tack up jerry' s ass .
double crossing blood clot .

what about aquaman ?
you even dream about it ... ... you' il probably wind up like them guppies .
not even a nibble .
strange .
this river' s usually full of catfish .
what was that ?
i don' t know .
driftwood , probably .
or a gator .
or the biggest catfish in the river !

yeah .
don' t you tell nobody about this , see .
i won' t .

howdy , john .
dale .
what do we got here ?
came in on that bateau , seems to be in shock .
earl , get this boy some help .
yes , sir .
come on , boy , let' s get you out of the sun .
where you all headed ?
lake verret .
oh , boating accident ?
now , you see , that' s the funny thing .
we got us a report of a shark attack .
now , a shark swims only in the ocean , so that makes it a saltwater fish .
yeah , that' s right .
it' s mostly right .
mostly ?
bull shark .
well , i' il be .
you learn something new every day .
keep it on top of the water , john .
okay , boys , let' s shove off .
okay .
cast off that stern line .
i got it .
go .
bull shark , huh ?
smart ass .
hello , john .
kelli .
this is gene bradley .
he works with me .
glad to meet you .
kelli' s been singing your praises .
really ?
can we talk ?
it' s important .
we shot seismic over black cove in sector 5 .
did avo , and the analysis showed dramatically increasing amplitude ... ... with significant horizontal displacement .
i don' t know what the hell you' re talking about , girl .
amplitude variation with offset .
it' s an interpretation technique ... ... to indicate rock lithology and fluid content .
it means they found a whole bunch of natural gas .
sector 5 is in the wildlife refuge .
whose bright idea was that ?
mine .
how' d you swing the lease ?
our people tacked it on to ... ... an appropriations bill and slipped it through congress .
energy independence , developing domestic resources , you know .
how many cubic feet ?
two to three billion .
we bring this in , discovery petroleum' s playing with the big boys .
well , hats and horns .
what are you doing here , kelli ?
we' ve been drilling and coming up with dusters .
we just got a bit stuck and had to break it loose .
so we' re a little befuddled .
might have to put that champagne on ice .
john , you' re the best dd in the business .
once upon a time .
who' s your tool pusher now ?
hank ellis .
hank trained me .
he doesn' t have your magic .
oh , magic .
right .
could you excuse us , please ?
john , i know how you feel about me .
do you ?
all right , you want me to say it ?
i' il say it .
i need you .
like three years ago ?
let' s not go through that .
what happened to you , huh , kelli ?
and your mighty scientific principles ?
i mean , drilling in a wildlife refuge ?
i make sure it' s done right .
the ecosystem isn' t harmed .
pull this one , it plays jingle bells .
money didn' t used to mean so much to you .
speaking of which , i know your situation .
i' m doing fine .
you' re gonna lose this boat .
that' s my business .
you' re just hardheaded and stubborn .
you used to like that about me .
look , i am done drilling .
period .
amen .
john , it wasn' t your fault .
yes , it was .
i have to live with that every day .
lf you fall off a horse ...
get off my boat .
john .
go on , get the hell off .
maybe we can ...
shut up , gene .
what up , dog ?
yo , what' s up ?
yo , chill , jerry , man .
it' s me , ice lce , baby .
yeah , i know .
you need permission to board a man' s boat .
no disrespect , man .
rick sent me down here to get his money , homey .
give me a break .
i just popped a nickel for rick .
did i beef on him ?
he appreciates that , all right ?
all he wants is the bank .
if i had it , i' d give it up , but i don' t .
why don' t you go tell everybody about your old jerry ...
this knife has gutted fish bigger than you .
lose the biscuit .
read my lips , ice .
i don' t got the ...
we know that , you little squirrelly ass bitch .
but you on your way to get it , right ?
right ?
right .
good .
we in four deep with your punk ass .
gas face me again , i' m gonna ride you all the way down .
you know what i' m saying ?
i hear you , ice .
what' s this ?
half your wages .
half ?
that don' t feed the coon dog , man .
emery ... ... you know my situation ?
i know you got more pride than sense .
hey , don' t bust my chops .
i' ve had enough of that for one day .
why give your wife the high hat ?
ex .
that' s none of your business .
yeah ?
this is my business right here , captain john .
so you quit your crying and tell me a tale before i pass a slap .
we met on an oil rig in texas .
i was the hotshot extracting big traps nobody else could .
she was gonna make the petroleum business environmentally friendly .
one , two , six , we fall in love ... ... get married .
there was a ...
there was a blowout .
two roughnecks got killed .
the company said it wasn' t my fault ... ... but it was .
people died on my watch .
so i took the jacket .
i walked away .
came back home to be a fisherman like my daddy .
kelli didn' t .
why ?
she said i was punishing myself needlessly .
she didn' t want to be a part of that .
you know ... ... our lives don' t belong to us , man .
we belong to god .
and sometimes god allows accidents to happen .
there are no accidents .
okay , then a gift from god .
you know , like a second chance .
don' t be stupid , john .
take it .
everyone worries about the great white ... ... but in fact , the bull shark ... ... is responsible for more attacks on people than any other species .
it' s big , up to 1 2 feet ... ... territorial , extremely aggressive .
who is it ?
it' s me .
it prefers to feed in shallow water , which , not incidentally ... ... is where most human aquatic recreational activity ...
when do you want to leave ?
as soon as possible .
tomorrow at dawn .
freshwater shark attacks are extremely rare .
be careful what you wish for .
this specimen' s probably out to sea by now .
i expect the atchafalaya river is as safe as a swimming pool .
who' s that one ?
st. honorius ... ... patron saint of oil refiners .
oil refiners ?
damn , emery , you got one for every occasion .
what' s all this stuff y' all got anyway ?
to help me prepare an environmental lmpact statement for the epa .
not to mention hold off save the river lawsuits .
what kind of clown wears yachting duds to go up the atchafalaya ?
the kind whose father is on the board of directors .
so he' s your boss ?
no , but he will be .
well , i' il call you when i get there .
yeah , boy , i can see why you left her to come back here .
she' s dumb , no sense of humour , and she' s ugly too .
just cast off , mr. broussard .
yes , sir , captain , sir .
we' re shoving off .
so how' d they find out ?
this was all supposed to be on the q . t .
we' il get there soon .
i don' t know who' s responsible .
i' il get to the bottom of it .
i' il call you .
would you ... ?
hey , hey , hey .
what' s your problem , man ?
i told you we were leaving .
i lost my cell phone .
i' m sure daddy will buy a new one .
when the captain says something , he means it , yeah ?
yeah .
houston thinks global' s on to the site .
already ?
they might be sending a team in .
they can' t work our lease .
if the field' s as big as it looks , they can cut in from the edges .
yeah , but we' ve still got a jump on them .
look , how i got my slot is no secret ... ... but i have a genuine vision for this company .
what ?
drilling in every wilderness area you can swing ?
in case you haven' t noticed , dr. raymond ... ... this country runs on petroleum .
as long as we depend on imports , we' re vulnerable ... ... to embargo and the whims of foreign governments .
this isn' t just a job to me ... ... it' s a mission .
well , hats and horns .
what are you shooting at , boy ?
what' d you do , dale , declare no limit day ?
that girl who died yesterday was tricia leighton .
her daddy' s ...
leighton chemical ?
right .
he' s put a bounty on the shark , $50, 000 .
i' m thinking about getting my own fishing pole .
well , i hope you bag him .
no , no , no .
where do you think you' re going ?
upriver .
no can do , john .
whole basin' s closed north of here .
because of one shark attack ?
two in 24 hours .
that boy you found , andre gautreaux , he finally talked .
his grandpappy got taken up near belle point yesterday morning .
poor kid .
but , dale , lake verret , belle point .
the shark' s heading this way .
that' s why everybody' s here .
the shark' s gotta pass this bend to make the gulf .
dale ... ... i need this gig .
go on , captain .
thanks , pal .
just do me a favour , john .
don' t get eaten by that shark .
it' d reflect mighty poorly on me .
roger that .
emery , let' s go .
y' all see anything ?
nothing .
let' s see if that thing works .
why are we stopping ?
gotta fix that fuel leak .
and emery hadn' t seen his family in a month .
i didn' t agree to this .
now' s your chance .
god , it' s like a scene from deliverance .
relax , gene , nobody' s gonna make you squeal like a pig .
why do you have to yank his chain ?
he just makes it too damn easy .
you never took me to the bayou before .
you never wanted to come .
but there is a certain charm to the simple life , no ?
dance ?
i didn' t come here to dance .
that' s my girl , all business .
that' s what this is about , john , business .
okay .
you know i' m gonna have to dive for samples in the cove .
any chance i' il wind up shark food ?
i doubt it .
okay , let' s ask .
well , what' d he say last night ?
has that thing gone out to sea or not ?
grand vieux says there' s a legend called le gardien de l ' anse noire .
kind of a spirit that protects the black cove .
with all due respect , i was referring to a shark ... ... not some spirit in a folktale .
maybe the shark' s the form that spirit takes .
or maybe grand vieux is just a crazy old cajun .
don' t mind emery .
he' s got one foot in the 21 st century , one in the 18th .
hey , at least i got laid last night .
take care , my brother .
les mchoires du mort .
translation ?
the jaws of death .
are you serious ?
no , he' s just hung over .
keep a sharp lookout .
if we' re lucky , we' il encounter ursus americanus luteolus ... ... the rare and endangered louisiana black bear .
damn !
they can see a quarter from the moon ... ... but they can' t make a cell phone work in the bayou .
what ?
nothing but a bunch of ... ... muck and crawfish .
so , jerry , you wouldn' t be honking our geese , would you ?
come on , guys .
it' s been five years .
every spring , the rains come , change the course of the river .
i' m doing the best i can , all right ?
i' m gonna say this one time .
your best better get better .
what are you waiting for ?
you' re going to kill me anyway .
send me home to mama , bitch .
come on !
come on .
cool it !
back off .
nobody' s gonna kill you , jeremiah , okay ?
now , you' re a standup kind of guy , right ?
get with the program ... ... and maybe you' il come out of this with a little compensation .
look .
we' ve got company .
here come the bigwigs .
i should' ve shined my boots .
how' d the global team beat us here ?
we shouldn' t have stopped .
ahoy .
ahoy , hank .
what happened to your hair ?
wife , kids , two dogs and a mother in law .
here you go .
hi , hank .
dr. raymond .
welcome back , john .
thanks .
who are those guys ?
not a clue , mr. bradley .
they must have slipped in last night .
they were here when we woke up .
this is discovery' s lease .
why don' t you tell them to vacate the area .
it' s not in my job description , sir .
heavenly , isn' t it ?
nature exists in perfect harmony ... ... free from war and corruption .
then man comes along and spoils everything .
can i get a shot of you on the bridge ?
sure .
so far , we' ve been able to protect this refuge ... ... but now some big oil company has moved in .
we' re suing , organizing protests .
we' re going to stop the aggression !
we' re going to save this sanctuary .
we' re going to preserve the peaceful serenity ...
damn .
last dive today .
why ?
too much bottom time .
you get bubbles in your blood .
how' s the volume ?
still below 3000 , but looks like the mud is rising .
you don' t wanna be here if it gets into the red .
blowout ?
don' t say that word .
don' t even think it .
just let me know if the level gets close .
according to the spectro ... ... i should be drilling into the heart of the trap .
but all the cuttings are still impermeable .
any signs of hydrocarbons ?
only traces .
that global team' s just waiting for us to drop the ball .
what do you want to do ?
how far down ?
five five .
let' s change the bha .
what do you have in mind ?
i think we might have missed the reservoir .
we' il change the drill string , put in some flex ... ... come back through here .
give me a couple hours ?
thank you , hank .
all right , boys !
we' re tripping out the drill !
where are they ?
what do you need ?
my specimen cups .
i can' t find my specimen cups .
thank you .
so , what kind of samples you taking ?
water , sediment ... ... crawfish are always a good indicator .
i' il live .
hey , kel .
what ?
i checked the sonar .
nothing bigger than a largemouth bass .
i' il keep an eye on it .
if i see anything , i' il flash the floods .
kelli , while you' re down there , do a little recon on those global boys .
okay .
you think they' re looking for oil with metal detectors ?
what else ?
some lady , isn' t she ?
do me a favour , gene .
don' t talk about my wife .
ex wife !
loser .
ahoy , atchafalaya queen !
hey , buddy !
there was a shark attack .
you might want to tell your divers .
suit yourself .
where the hell is brett ?
how should i know ?
what am i , his dive buddy ?
maybe he found a mermaid .
help !
john , help !
i found him passed out .
are you okay ?
yeah .
all right , let' s get him in the boat .
okay .
okay , buddy .
nasty .
you have no idea .
what' s your name ?
vanrooyen .
brett vanrooyen .
easy .
who you with ?
you' re with global , right ?
what is he talking about ?
global .
only the world' s third largest oil company .
you' re their advance team , right ?
wrong .
you' re trespassing on our lease .
my apologies .
i want you out of here !
give it a rest !
he could have died .
it' s none of my business .
this used to be a free country ... ... but what are you diving for ?
sunken treasure , of course .
yo , brett !
you okay , dog ?
permission to board ?
granted .
thanks .
damn , homey !
was it a shark ?
no .
no , it was a pontiac .
this is our lease .
it gives us exclusive rights to the entire cove .
we' re not looking for oil .
just a little recreational diving .
we' il be gone tomorrow .
i' m ordering you to vacate this area immediately .
who you giving orders , fool ?
what , you a cop ?

there was another shark attack this morning by foulaneaux .

well done .
you really want to turn this into a blood fest ?
look .
they' ve seen our faces , and they know your name .
not the one i was born with .
that' s you , all right ?
i can' t take them kind of chances .

we gotta get our asses out of here .
that' s what we gotta do .
not without the money , honey .
who do you think is stupid enough to get back in the water with that thing ?
so , what' s in the box ?
all i could salvage from the magazine .
hang on , gene .
don' t give up .
who' s that one ?
st. vitus .
really ?
and what' s st. vitus gonna do for us ?
provide protection from attack by wild beasts .
i thought that shark went back out to sea .
so did i.
no , he come home .
the guardian of the black cove .
he don' t like us being here .
did you get it ?
did you get it ?
the shark ?
i don' t know .
you don' t know ?
what you mean , you don' t know ?
what we gonna do now ?
i' il think of something .
they' re going to kill us , aren' t they ?
only if we let them .
kelli ?
i' m here , gene .
we had a blowout , didn' t we ?
yeah .
have we hit pay dirt ?
yeah , bigtime .
so i was right ?
yeah , you were right .
i was right .
why is this happening ?
why doesn' t matter .
it just is .
you know , people have been killing sharks for years .
most species are almost extinct .
maybe they' re just tired of it .
maybe .
maybe something else .
maybe retribution , yeah ?
everybody on this boat is greedy .
they want money , they want power , they want oil .
we was put on this earth to give , not to take .
the wrath of a vengeful god ?
lf the gumboot fits , partner .
or maybe that shark' s just hungry , yeah ?
we scared away the fish he usually eats .
and now we on the menu .
stop it !
i love sharks , kelli .
i admire them .
they kill without remorse .
they kill or starve .
gene is dead .
you must love that .
i didn' t kill him .
i' ve never killed any human being .
you' re one of those good bad guys with a code of honour .
i' m not a bad guy at all .
spare me .
well , that' s exactly what i intend to do .
i had a band once .
oh , yeah ?
what' d you call it ?
jerry and the idiots ?
we were actually pretty good , dog .
it' s a tough business to get into .
you need somebody on the inside , right ?
someone on your team .
you' re a whole lot dumber than you look .
which is why you don' t have to suit up ... ... because you saved my life today .
am i supposed to be grateful ?
is that what you want ?
for me to show my gratitude ?
why , kelli , whatever did you have in mind ?
hands up !
drop the knife !
well , which is it , pal ?
hands up or drop the knife ?
hands up or drop the knife ?
don' t kill him .
why the hell not ?
they' re going for a little night dive .
all clear .
this is crazy .
like i wanna go diving with that guppy .
shut up .
just do it , all right ?
dumb ass fish probably got blown up anyway .
farmer john goes down first .
what' s wrong , emery ?
i mean , other than the general terror of the situation ?
come again ?
i can' t swim .
you can' t swim ?
you' ve been a fisherman all your life and you can' t swim ?
i' m sorry , john .
it' s okay , partner .
hey , my man can' t swim .

kiss my ass .
i want three men in that water , and i want that money .
now , move it .
i' il go .

you' re staying right here with me .
you say you never killed anyone .
you wanna start by drowning a man who can' t swim ?
smart .
smart , ballsy , devious .
you' ve got all the trimmings , don' t you , baby ?
you sure you wanna do this ?
hell , no .
it just beats the alternatives .
listen to me .
if you find that money , you flash your light three times .
swim to the moon pool .
i' il meet you there .
do not come back to this boat .
what about him ?
we' il trade the money for emery , and maybe we' il get out of this alive .
okay .
i may not get another chance to say this ...

i' ve been living them every night for five years .
get your ass out of the way .
forget it , man .
damn !
you idiot .

the whole thing' s rusted solid , okay ?
we' il open it when we get back to rick' s .
i don' t think so , homey .
because we ain' t going back to rick' s .

so i gotta ask jerry , jerry ...
i' m all like , some of 3 million or being trunk music ?
tough call , huh , brett ?
who got at who ?
why don' t you go for a night dive .
we transfer whatever gear we need over to the queen ... ... then scuttle this tub , like it sunk in the blowout .
what about them ?
shoot them ?
we don' t want to leave any evidence .
we cut them , make them bleed , feed them to the shark .
damn , jerry .
you' re a cold pimp .
thanks .
get up .
