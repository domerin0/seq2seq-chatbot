the stones are already mine .
yo , check this out ?
i got them , i' m selling them , put the money on the wood !
i don' t have time for this .
that' s your last offer ?

did you see my new dvd players ?
<i>all right !
okay ! </ i>
<i> give me that ! </ i>
<i> i forgot i had them .
sorry ! </ i>
i could' ve resisted more .
but they could' ve beat me into a coma or killed me .
how could i tell you where the stones are if i' m dead or on life support ?
so i threw in the towel , reluctantly , for your sake .
okay , so you saved yourself to tell me something .
so tell me .
what ?
who was it ?
i don' t know .
what did they say ?
give me the stones , you fat cracker motherfucker .
that sort of thing .
that' s it ?
that' s pretty bad .
cracker is kind of racist .
thanks for keeping yourself alive long enough to tell me nothing !
did you call the police ?
did i call the police ?
look around here , are you crazy ?
only question now is , who' s behind this jack move ?
i don' t know , but they got some great guns i can' t even get .
u. s. special forces only .
chambers .
jump chambers ?
i hope not .
hey , who' s jump chambers ?

su says he has the stones .
but why cut me off ?
why not negotiate for the girl ?
doesn' t make any sense .
buyers fly in tomorrow .
should we stop them ?
we' il never regain their confidence .
we need information .
find the right people , pay whatever it costs .
something' s not right .
something' s happening with the stones .
what about the girl ?
we' il need her .
she stays alive ... ... for now .
yeah , i' m on my way to see chambers now .

that bitch brought in too .
i made a lot of money with her , but that' s all stopped now .
you stopped that .
you decided it was okay to put an end to that .
black stones , what ?
i need them back .
the only smart thing you did was not pimping her yourself .
see , because then i' d have been real heated and you' d have been real dead .
but you don' t pimp , right ?
you' re just a thief in the night , stealing shit that don' t belong to you .
hey .

he don' t talk ?
i don' t speak korean .
yeah , well , i do .
bought me a little korean spot downtown .

how do you know ?
i know .
i can just feel it .
it' s never happened to you ?

how would jump feel about me coming back and all ?
you let me worry about jump chambers .
in the meantime ... ... how about we go to my office and we talk about this a little bit more ?
it' s not exactly boxing matches , it' s a lot more dangerous .
no gloves or nothing , no rules , period .
it' s huge money .
it' s very illegal .
they hold it during the day to fool cops .
the man you remember , how do you know he' il be here ?
i don' t , but this is chambers ' operation , so it' s a damn good place to start .
here we are .
this is a private club .
you can' t come in .
it' s me , archie .
everybody likes me here .
hey , it' s that asshole archie again .
how can you recognize him ?
well , i didn' t see his face , but they all kind of look the same .
of course so do you guys .
no offense .
but i will remember that pinky ring because it was awesome .
he' s got , like , a 10 carat , round cut , square setting , good color and clarity .
i remember thinking about the damage it' d do to my face if he hit me .
i gotta make sure mr. pinky ring doesn' t recognize me , so i got a disguise .
how do we get in ?
leave it to me .
i' il take care of it .
hey , buddy .

<i>and it looks like this parking garage is where</ i> <i>it will end .
as police have sealed ... </ i> <i> ... the building and continue</ i> <i>their search inside for the man who ... </ i> <i> ... led them on what certainly had to</ i> <i>be the most extreme chase we' ve ever seen . </ i>
<i> don' t know why these idiots do it , barbara . </ i>
<i> they never get away , do they ? </ i>
<i>they sure don' t , and they just endanger</ i> <i>innocent citizens in the process . </ i>
<i>here' s another car exiting the structure . </ i>
<i>police talking to the driver, </ i> <i>inspecting the vehicle . </ i>
<i>well , the police know they have him</ i> <i>trapped inside the parking structure . </ i>
<i>knowing cops the way i do , i can tell you</ i> <i>they' re good and po' d , excuse my language . </ i>
<i>and they' re not about to let this guy</ i> <i>slip through their fingers . </ i>
mr. chambers is resting .
he says not to bother him .
<i>hey , baby . </ i>
<i>please don' t go . </ i>
<i>you want me to stay ? </ i>
<i>yeah , i need someone to stay here</ i> <i>and help keep me awake . </ i>
<i>wait a minute . </ i>
<i>i know that face . </ i>
<i>a lot of men had that look on their face</ i> <i>when i got married . </ i>
i knew the stones were in there .
he was a tough guy at first , but when i got close to his nuts he sang like cline dion .
how we gonna get them out of there ?
that place is always jumping .
yo , dog , something' s not right .
i got the same feeling .
the doorman .
where is he ?
everybody stay put .
sorry .
watch my nuts , all right ?
no chambers ' guys .
something' s wrong .
this guy looks better dead .
he said they were here in the fountain .
where are they ?
this can' t be fucking happening .
they have to be here !
that' s it ?
one stone ?
ling .
he has the rest .
how the fuck do you know ?
i know .

we' re back in business .

i' m going .
i' m trying .
i see chairs and green light .
chairs .
green light .
where' s the light coming from ?
i can' t tell .
there' s a machine .
it' s like a laser show .
laser show ?
<i> daddy ... </ i> ... hurry !
i' m scared !
<i> i wanna go home ! </ i>

<i>it' s gonna be okay . </ i>

daddy ?
vanessa ?
<i> daddy ! </ i>
<i>vanessa ? </ i>
vanessa !
great !
shit !
he' s doing it here tonight .
doing what ?
selling the stones .
the thai laser emits green light .
he needs it to enrich them .
to show their power .
what the hell are you talking about ?
what are these stones ?
a new form of synthetic plutonium .
small and portable , but mega powerful .
am i right ?
there' s a bunch of international scumbags who' d pay a lot of money ... ... to get their hands on those .
and then , look out world .
enough of this shit !
how' s it gonna get me back my daughter ?
we' re operational .
the buyers will want to arrive and leave quickly .
somewhere private , accessible by aircraft .
vanessa did say she was inside of a big building .
could be a hangar .
there' s about a dozen little airports around here , man .
we ain' t gonna never get them all .
flight plans .
yeah , flight plans .
they gotta list a destination .
every aircraft that takes off ... ... has to file one with the aviation administration or risk getting shot down ... ... by the u. s. military .
so you get that list ... ... and maybe we can find out where the sale' s going down .
daria , call the aviation people .
use our l. a. p. d. credentials .
we need flight info on all aircrafts coming in or going out .
miles , the no gun policy is no longer in effect .
break out the heat .
everybody else , get ready to move .
tommy , create a diversion .
i got just the thing if we can fit in it .
wick airfield .
five private choppers arriving tonight within minutes of each other .
sounds like our best bet .
better be for vanessa s sake .
let' s go .
you are the world' s foremost arms dealers .
you all know that weaponry equals power , and in the world of weaponry ... ... nukes rule .
but nuclear material is hard to obtain and difficult to handle .
but what if it weren' t ?
that' s the question that brought you here tonight .
and this is the answer .
a unique , man made element .
in its present state it' s completely inert .
zero radiation ...
... zero volatility .
one small fragment easily transformed into a source of immense energy .
more powerful than weapons grade plutonium 100 times its size .
goggles on .
<i>so , what the hell does taiwan</ i> <i>gotta do with this ? </ i>
<i>we developed the stones . </ i>
<i>they belong to us . </ i>
<i>okay , what about the guy you' re after ? </ i>
<i>how come you know him so well ? </ i>
<i>we grew up together . </ i>
<i>we joined the government at the same time . </ i>
<i>wait a minute .
wait a minute . </ i>
<i>you were on the same side ? </ i>
<i>he betrayed us .
he killed our team . </ i>
<i>he tried to kill me too . </ i>
<i>if you don' t take this</ i> <i>motherfucker out , i will . </ i>
<i>the stones first , then him . </ i>
creating a highly reactive radioactive isotope ... ... requires altering the atomic structure of the original material .
normally this is accomplished by adding neutrons .
here , we' re using electromagnetic distillation to strip away protons .
in the process , the fragment' s potential yield is increasing exponentially .
we' re now reaching the yield level of a sidewinder missile .
enough power to take out a tank .
a tomahawk cruise missile , enough to destroy a building .
scud .
that' s a few city blocks gone .
hiroshima .
two hiroshimas .
new world order .
