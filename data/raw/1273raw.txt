i got a lot of work to do today .
i know your work is important .
are you going to start with that ?
i' m gonna go in the other room and pretend to make a phone call .
congrats on making detective .
thanks , chae .

even if i left the hope diamond in there , it' s just not worth it .

would you just give me the goddamn keys ?
they' re on the desk right in front of you .
i' il drop them off .

medical examiner .

you' re forgetting your wife .
she left me .
i told her the other day ... told her today ... come get her stuff .
how' s the pro football quarterback ?
he' s up north hunting for the weekend .

you still got your ring on .
chris needs me .

he' s lost , been that way since he got cut from the team .
i guess i feel sorry for him .

i' il be right there .
ann merai .
hi .
dr. frieland .
this is my brother matt .
nice to meet you .
sorry to bring you in today .
i was in surgery all day yesterday .
please .
you can talk in front of him .
it' s fine .
right .
okay .
ann , i' m afraid there' s been a bit of a setback .
i had your tests back yesterday .
the cancer is not in remission .
it' s come back very aggressively .
it' s attacked your liver and lungs .
how long ?
well , that' s difficult to say .
how long ?
five , six months .
no one can say for sure .
but i feel fine .
listen ... there' s a counselor here at the hospital i' d like you to see .
she' s very good .
she' il help you during this period .
thank you for coming in on your day off .
ann , wait .
excuse me .
maybe you could speak to her about the counseling ?
listen , you should be able to do something , right ?
what about that experimental stuff ?
you know , like " 60 minutes " ?
i don' t know .
there are alternative approaches .
yeah ?
sure .
let' s see .
autologous cancer vaccines , hematology procedures , hyperthermia treatments .
here .
take a look at those .
they' re extremely expensive , and there are no guarantees .
thanks .
okay .
you all right ?
yeah .
why didn' t you tell me , baby ?
i' m sorry .
when i was with you ...
i forgot about it .
for a couple hours , i didn' t think about dying .
i understand .
you know , they' ve got this alternative stuff .
there' s a clinic in switzerland ...
i know .
with my blood .
i don' t put much stock in all that stuff .
they said there' s a 17 % chance , a 17 % success rate .
a whole 17 % ?
odds are better i' d hit the lottery , which is what i' d have to do to afford something like that .
listen .
where are you going ?
i don' t think we should do this anymore .
it wasn' t right for me to drag you into this .
you didn' t drag me into anything .
i' m a big boy .
matt , i' m dying .
i' m dying .
thanks for the flowers .
you' re welcome .
the girls at work were so jealous .
glad to hear that .
that' s not why you called me .
what' s up ?
i want to show you something .
chris didn' t hit you again ?
no .
when we were married , we took out insurance policies on each other , but they were only for $100, 000 .
this says $1 million .
did you know about this ?
no .
i remember signing things , but i didn' t know he' d made changes .
he can' t get away with this .
this is fraud .
you were sick .
no .
i was diagnosed six months ago .
chris increased the policy almost a year ago , right after my 32nd birthday .
my mother was 33 when she died of cancer .
oh , no .
that chris ?
he' s here .
maybe he can explain this .
no .
why not ?
now' s the time .
this is not the time .
when is the time ?
i don' t know .
please .
i' m sorry , baby .
i' m just taking the trash out .
thought you were working a double tonight .
yeah .
bet you did .
howwas your appointment on saturday ?
appointment ?
yeah , with dr. frieland .
i didn' t have an appointment .
no ?
you sure ?
i' m sure .
' cause jay saw you go inside his office .
you were going inside with some other guy .
no , i just stopped by .
i had to ask some questions .
now you were there .
i was there , but i had to ask him some questions .
here we go with the lies again .
i' m not lying to you .
yes , you are !
start telling me the truth !
you' re hurting me !
why do you make me do this ?
i' m not making you do anything !
it ain' t my goddamn fault !
it ain' t my fault !
chris , how you doing , football player ?
good , mathias .
how you doing ?
i' m good .
judy anderson called , said she saw a prowler in the neighborhood .
you see anything ?
what about your wife ?
she home ?
she didn' t see anything .
you didn' t ask her .
she didn' t say anything about it .
maybe i should ask her , not that i don' t trust your mind reading .
hey , ann , how you doing ?
i didn' t see anything .
i' m going to check the perimeter .
go ahead .
you see somebody , you holler .
you have a good night .
we did it .
this wasn' t necessary .
my name shouldn' t be on your house .
i' il buy my own in a few years .
all right .
chief whitlock .
hey , baby , it' s me .
what time do you get off ?
i' ve found a way to go to that clinic .
right .
can you talk ?
hold on .
forget it .
excuse me .
i' m sorry .
you know , i' ve got to go .
t ell her i say hi .
bye .
is this a bad time ?
can you talk ?
yeah .
it' s no problem .
you' ve got to hear this .
it' s incredible .
i name you the beneficiary of my life insurance policy .
no , no .
not me personally .
you name the living gift as your beneficiary after we purchase the policy from you .
and you ...
i mean , the living gift ... collects on the policy when i die .
as the beneficiary , yes , we collect on the policy .
so you make a profit if she dies ?
is that legal ?
we wouldn' t be here if it wasn' t .
how much do i get ?
the amount depends on how long your medical staff says i have to live .
how about a ballpark figure ? $750, 000 .
i know .
even if they have to repeat the treatment several times , there would be enough money for us to go somewhere .
like the conch festival in key west ?
no .
clambake in opa locka ?
no !
europe .
europe ?
yeah .
or africa .
i' m going to beat this .
you watch .
richard petty , give me a hand .
hey , man , watch it .
don' t slip .
watch that blood .
come on , ann , talk to me .
their investors won' t let them buy any new policies .
the living gift ?
we can go somewhere else .
we' il get somebody else to buy it .
i can' t .
there' s only two days left to change it .
what do you mean ?
a provision says the beneficiary can' t be changed after a year , and that' s in two days .
well , maybe we could call down ...
it' s too late !
listen ...
don' t , don' t .
don' t .
this is not fixable .
just go .
just go .
what did alex pick up from your place the other day ?
i don' t know .
well , over for sure now , huh ?
she left something so she' d have a chance to come see you .
see if she still had feelings .
based on what i saw , she didn' t have any feelings ... except anger .
think you' ve had enough .
i' m trying to help you here .
one of your patrons has been overserved .
i may have to cite you on that , helena .
see you tomorrow , chae .
see you tomorrow .
man .
bustin ' my chops , mr. drinking on duty .
i' il see you later .
good night .
take it easy .
let me get you a refill , chief .
no , i' m good , chris .
it ain' t a bribe , just a beer .
two , whatever he was just drinking .
thank you .
let me ask you something .
that night you were out there looking for that prowler , did you see anybody ?
no , i didn' t .
i had this feeling when i got home that ann was with some other guy .
really ?
i think he snuck out the back when i got home .
no , i didn' t see anybody .
i' il tell you what , though .
next time that little pussy comes around ...
little pussy ?
the guy scurries out the back door the second he hears my voice .
" scurries " ?
yeah .
i could almost respect a man who had the balls to confront me , tell me , " yeah , i' m banging your wife .
maybe this guy , maybe there' s nothing he would rather do than to tell you that you' re a lousy husband and don' t deserve ann .
maybe there' s nothing he would rather do than to walk up to your face , look you in the eye , and say to you , " chris , i' m banging your wife ... good .
maybe .
you know , maybe ... your wife won' t let him .
i' d respect him at least .
and if he did that , then i' d go up to him ,
look him in his eye , and i' d say ,
just come near her again ... ... and i' il kill you .
wow .
you' re talking to the wrong guy , because as a police officer ...
i can' t let you go around threatening people' s lives .
if you' re serious , i would be obligated to do something .
really ?
that' s right .
thanks for the beer ... and the conversation .
thanks for listening .
you give ann my best , if you can .
you been waiting long ?
sorry about last night .
you must really be mad at me .
god , i used to love coming out here with you .
i thought i was the shit , being a freshman making out with a senior .
you were .
still are .
i guess i was .
here .
what' s this ?
my going away present .
going away ?
insurance policy .
you' re making me the beneficiary ?
buy that fishing boat you and chae have always talked about .
right .
here .
no .
i' m leaving tomorrow .
what ?
i' m leaving town tomorrow .
i' ve got to get out of here .
i need to get away from chris .
i need some peace .
chief whitlock .
how can i help you ?
you just did , buddy .
how you doing ?
good .
take this .
meet me at my house .
what is it ?
it' s a gift to you .
switzerland .
what ?
it' s money .
what money ?
that drug money ?
matt , no .
oh , my god .
what if they want it back ?
by law , the money has to stay in the custody of the arresting department until the appeals process is over .
with the money scarcetti has , it could take years .
but tony and the guys ...
they think i' m putting it in a safe deposit box .
what time does chris get home ?
11 : 30 .
go to your house , pack a bag , meet me at my house , 11 : 00 .
you okay ?
see you later .
what are you doing here ?
barbara' s pissed off about something .
got to wait her out .
listen .
you see anybody come in here ?
no .
you sure ?
okay .
why don' t you head over to the scuttlebutt ?
they cut me off , no thanks to you .
tell them chief whitlock said everything' s okay .
that' s the first place barbara' s going to look !
she won' t look there .
she will !
i' ve got half a pack of cigarettes in there !
tell engine two to lay it out and start attacking it from the back !
go , go !
pull it up !
let' s get moving !
1919 on 415 san juan .
that' s about four miles outside of town .
go !
let' s keep moving !
aim the hose right there !
mathias , you all right ?
i know it' s hard to take .
i' il grab you a cup of coffee .
was it an accident ?
i don' t know .
maybe .
these propane tanks just don' t blow for no reason .
man , this place was an inferno .
those poor folks didn' t have a chance .
hi , chief .
chief .
what are you doing here ?
i' m a homicide detective , and there' s two dead bodies .
so what happened ?
they think the propane tank blew .
you knowwho they are ?
i think it' s definitely " were .
right , chae .
hey , mathias , check it out .
definitely arson .
it' s definitely arson .
definitely .
the closer i stay to the scene , the better .
yeah , it' s possibly a double homicide .
we' re gonna have to take this thing over .
chief , judy anderson' s mom is visiting from orlando .
last night , judy said her mom saw somebody sneaking around .
i checked it out , didn' t see anything .
we should probably tell alex .
i' il tell her .
you get back to the office .
they want me to run my investigation out of your place for the next 24 .
i need your help ... background on the vics , people they knew .
a tour guide ?
you cool with that ?
okay .
no problem .
are you sure ?
no problem at all .
why don' t we ride back and you fill me in on the harrisons ?
my boys will set up at your place .
okay .
great .
i just wanted to say i' m really sorry about the timing .
what do you mean ?
with the papers , and then this today .
the divorce papers ?
i should have called you before .
that would have been nice .
i know .
but it has been eight months .
don' t you think we need closure ?
i really don' t want to talk about it .
thanks for opening up .
let' s talk about the harrisons .
either of them screwing around ?
i don' t know .
is anybody happily married these days ?
these have already been gone through .
right .
he was supposed to get off at 11 : 30 .
right .
mr. harrison .
so you don' t know if mr. harrison came to work or not .
hold on .
did you know she worked as a dental hygienist for a dr. shider ?
really ?
no .
i' m going to pay him a visit .
you want to come ?
okay .
thanks .
so she quit yesterday ?
well , kind of .
ann merai had terminal cancer .
really ?
i think she was trying to keep it quiet .
anything else you could tell us ?
i think she was having an affair .
did she actually tell you she was having an affair ?
we don' t really talk a lot , mainly what' s happening on our stories .
but i just got the feeling .
sometimes when she' d be on the phone , she would talk real quiet .
whisper ?
did you ever see him , or did she tell you who he was ?
no .
but he was classy .
about a week ago , she got flowers from rosie' s .
really nice .
it was beautiful .
remember , bruce ?
but i met her husband once , and he just doesn' t seem like the type to send flowers .
right .
rosie !
chief whitlock .
listen , we' re trying to find out if some flowers were sent to an ann merai harrison last week , sent to her office .
harrison .
check and see if one of your guys sent them .
what hospital ?
mercy med .
chris harrison .
her husband .
okay .
thanks a lot , rosie .
yeah .
no , that' s all .
thank you , rosie .
if you' d like to make a call ...
you ready ?
i guess so .
okay .
all right .
thank you for your help .
sure .
thank you .
if you think of anything else , here' s my card .
thanks a lot .
please don' t do me like that .
you knew i wasn' t finished .
i' m sorry .
dr. shider gave me the name of ann merai' s doctor .
i want to find out more about her cancer .
you can drop me off back at the station .
you really don' t like being around me , do you ?
no .
i just , you know ...
there isn' t any reason for both of us to be wasting time at the doctor' s office .
what' s so pressing that you have to do ?
i do have a job .
i am chief of police .
yeah , of a four person department , matt .
that' s the problem between the two of us .
you think your job is more important than my job .
never said that .
yeah , you did .
you never say it directly , but in indirect ways you say it .
you wanted to leave banyan key so we could be closer to your important job .
you never said the commute was taking time away from us ?
i didn' t have a problem with that .
you didn' t ?
so i' m hearing things now ?
whatever .
is that the reason you' re not coming ?
is that your date paging you ?
one of my four officers checked in .
it' s a tracking device .
and you can tell on that ?
that' s what it tells me .
gps .
we' re all tied into it .
the mayor' s brother sells them , so we spent half the budget on them .
see , if we were moving , you' d see it tracking .
sorry .
if we were moving right now , it would show us tracking .
great .
why don' t we drive to the doctor' s office , and i can see how it works ?
i' m going to the bathroom .
i' il meet you in there .
hi .
may i help you ?
yeah .
dr. donovan' s office .
her office is on the third floor .
thank you , ramona .
ann harrison didn' t have cancer .
are you sure ?
not counting the time she spent in atlanta ,
ann merai has been my patient since junior high .
if she had cancer , i would have known about it .
i don' t get it .
maybe she saw another doctor .
she was here for her yearly when she first got back to town two months ago , and she was healthy as a proverbial horse .
i' m looking it over here , and ...
i don' t understand .
who told you she had cancer ?
excuse me .
so ...
can i help you ?
yeah , i' m looking for dr. frieland .
you' re looking at him .
you' re dr. frieland ?
yes , i am .
hold on , pop .
you' re sure ?
this is your office ?
it has been for ten years , yes .
look , i' il get back to you .
do you have a patient named ann merai harrison ?
i really can' t tell you that .
you can tell me .
was she your patient or not ?
was she your patient or not ?
was she your patient or not ?
no , i' ve never had a patient by that name .
you sure ?
yes , i' m sure , very sure .
yeah , i would know that .
okay , i' m sorry .
that your pen ?
pen ?
yes .
do you use it much ?
no , not very much .
you don' t mind if i take it , do you ?
no , you can have the pen .
sure .
it' s yours .
take it .
it' s yours .
right .
right .
i know that part .
hang on one sec .
did you get a checkup or something ?

we need those phone records now .
all right .
thanks .
you all right ?
yeah .

fantastic .
how' s this , ma' am ?
you fixed his nose already ?
just wonderful .
hey , chief .
how you doing , judy ?
i' m fine , thanks , considering ...
alex , we' ve got an eyewitness here .
mr. anderson , this is detective diaz whitlock .
well , just ...
we' re on top of it .
i told them how judy' s mom saw somebody sneaking around the harrison place last night .
got them right over there sketching it out for us . ... the guy she saw outside her window ...
that' s her right there ?
good job .
chief , check this out .
sketch of a prowler out to the harrisons ' last night .
look .

hi , tony .
no .
i mean , no .
he looked like him .
like who ?

like me ?
yeah .
you .
mom , he' s the chief of police .
so he was black , ma' am ?
yeah , he was black .
wait a minute .
maybe him .
mrs. anderson , thank you .
thank you very , very much .
anyway ...
i' m so sorry .
mother was raised in a different time .
don' t worry about it .
we' re on top of it , okay ?
i need to talk to you .
i appreciate you coming down .
i am so embarrassed .
please , you' ve got to stop .
i want you to take this up to miami for me , okay ?
i want you to give it to a detective gissen .
gissen ?
gissen , right .
i' m going to give you his number .
i need prints on that asap .
is it for this thing ?
yeah .
excuse me , chief .
yeah .
an agent stark from the dea is on line one for you .
who ?
agent stark .
said it' s about the scarcetti case .
thank you .
chief whitlock .
agent stark , dea .
how you doing ?
busy .
you and me both , pal .
i understand you guys are holding evidence in the scarcetti case .
great .
that makes you my new best friend .
i' m going to send some agents this aftemoon to pick up that cash .
we think it was used last year in a sting operation with paolo estaban .
if we can tie the serial numbers to the bills you guys have , we can tie estaban to scarcetti .
this is a top priority for us , chief .
with this evidence , we can kill two birds with one stone , nail estaban and scarcetti .
why don' t i call you tomorrow , and we figure out a time ...
this had to be done the day before yesterday .
we' ve got a court date next week .
the evidence has to stay with me until the appeals process is over .
i didn' t call you to get a lecture on the rules of evidence .
we need to check the serial numbers , and that' s what we' re going to do .
when i hang up on you in ten seconds ,
i want you to type up a chain of evidence receipt .
one of my men will be happy to sign it for you this aftemoon .
oh , yeah , and , chief ...
yeah ?
it' s been ten seconds .
chief , you okay ?
yeah .
fine .
just tell gissen that i need those prints really quick .
i' m sure alex can ...
we don' t want to give them to alex .
sorry .
i just thought ...
just do it !
all right .
okay .
i' m sorry .
i' m very sorry .
just go there , stay there , and call me as soon as they' re done .
you got it .
no , i' ve been on hold .
when should i call back ?
okay .
thanks .
here you go .
baste , my phone records !
how long can it take to fax over a few sheets of paper ?
i' il call them again .
alex , i think we got something here .
what ?
look at this entry into the checkbook , that last one .
is this the only entry you found ?
so far , but it' s a new register .
what' s going on ?
they got a life insurance policy , and we' ve got a potential murder .

ann merai names me beneficiary on her insurance policy , and i was having an affair with her .
opportunity ... an eyewitness saw me outside their house the night it blew up .
you want to hear some more ?
alibi .
home , by myself .
that good ?
at least you changed your cell phone number .
even if alex wanted to believe me , there' s so much evidence against me , she' d have to turn me in .
you' re right .
that' d kill any chance of getting back together .
what ?
she says , " let' s call the divorce off .
what are you talking about ?
i' m looking at murder charges .
the gal' s a peach .

i gotta get out of town , but i don' t know where to go .

i didn' t think i could do this , but i will .
you set this up .
put your gun on the floor .
are you sure ?
don' t do this .
where' s the money ?

did you love her ?
no .
why would you do this , then ?
because i' m ...

i just needed to move the rest of my stuff .
that' s cool , i guess .
the house is a mess .
this came for you at the station .
you opened it ?
you opened my mail ?
why you always opening my mail ?
just read it .
they just want you to fill out the forms .
to claim amount payable to the beneficiary for the sum of $1 million .
what ?
we' re rich .
we' re rich .
how about that ? $1 million .
easy , chae .
he can' t take that money .
i can' t take the money ?
why not ?
it' s a conflict of interest .
he' s the legal beneficiary .
i am the legal beneficiary .
and he' s one of the arresting officers .
what the hell' s that got to do with anything ?
tell him how much trouble you can get in .
it' s a million bucks !
it' s the chance of a lifetime !

as his wife , i' m telling you he' s not taking that money .
as my wife ?
as your wife .
come on .
come on , don' t fall for that .
what do you mean , as my wife ?
as your wife .
you said you came to move your stuff .
i' m moving back in .
this is great .
congratulations .
it' s kind of fortuitous .
you serious ?
yeah .

it' s a million bucks .
let' s not lose focus .
you know , a honeymoon fund , a nursery wing for the ...
this is the golden pot at the end of the storm thing !

i' m a patient man .
i am a patient man .
