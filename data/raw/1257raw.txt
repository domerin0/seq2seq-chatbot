neighbors heard them screaming at each other ...
like , for two hours .
nothing new .
then they heard the gun go off , both barrels .
crime of passion .
just look at all the passion on that wall .
well , it' s a done deal , all but the paperwork .
the kid see it ?
what ?
the kid .
what kind of fucking question is that ?
we are all going to be real glad ... when we get rid of you , somerset .
it' s always these questions with you .
did the kid see it ?
who gives a fuck ?
he' s dead .
his wife killed him .
anything else , it has nothing to do with us .
detective somerset ?
i' m detective mills .
lieutenant , i apologize for interrupting .
i get in town 20 minutes ago , they dump me here .
look , mills ?
i thought we might find a bar someplace .
i' d like to get to the precinct , if it' s all the same .
not much time for this transition thing .
i meant to ask you something ... when we spoke on the phone before .
why here ?
i don' t follow .
well , all this effort to get transferred .
it' s the first question that popped into my head .
i guess the same reasons as you had ... before you decided to quit , yeah ?
you just met me .
maybe i' m not understanding the question .
it' s very simple .
you actually fought to get reassigned here .
i' ve just never seen it done that way before .
i thought i could do some good .
it would be greatfor me if we didn' t start out ... kicking each other in the balls .
but you' re calling the shots , lieutenant .
yes .
i want you to look , and i want you to listen .
i wasn' t guarding the taco bell .
i' ve worked homicide five years .
not here .
i understand that .
over the next seven days , detective ... you' il do me the favor of remembering that .
say it again .
i thought we moved here to get away from tractor pulls .
serpico' s got to go .
you might want to get rid of this little crusty eye , serpico .
did you get it ?
got it .
good .
coffee ?
no ?
nothing' s been touched .
everything' s like i found it .
what time was death established ?
like i said , i didn' t touch anything ... but he' s got his face in a plate of spaghetti ... for about forty five minutes now .
no one bothers with vital signs ?
did i stutter ?
this guy ain' t breathing ... unless he started breathing spaghetti sauce .
so that' s how it' s done around here ?
i beg your pardon , detective ... this guy' s sitting in a pile of his own piss and shit .
if he wasn' t dead , he would have stood up by now .
thank you , officer .
thank you .
i wonder ...
what exactly was the point ... of the conversation you were about to get into ?
don' t know .
how many times has barney fife ... found dead bodies that weren' t dead ?
drop it .
somebody phone guinness .
i think we' ve got a record here .
better homes and gardens .
who said this was murder ?
no one .
his heart has got to be the size of a canned ham .
if this isn' t a coronary ...
well , i don' t know .
how about that ?
we had this case once ... guy dead on the ground , knife in his back .
got to be murder , right ?
fuck .
anyway , big insurance policy involved , yeah ?
the guy took the tip of the blade ... stuck it in his own shoulder blades .
must' ve screwed up a few times .
there was multiples .
could you please be quiet ?
wait a minute .
what ?
got a bucket here .
what' s in it ?
oh , god !
fucking vomit .
any blood in it ?
i didn' t see any .
help yourself .
are you thinking it' s poison ?
oh , wonderful .
very moody .
are you thinking it' s poison , somerset ?
you girls have got forensics waiting outside .
i don' t know if we' il all fit , though .
there' s room .
light' s the problem .
hi .
detective mills , would you go help the officers ... question the neighbors ?
what ?
send in forensics on your way out , please .
he' s dead .
thank you , doctor .
you' ve seen my files , right ?
you' ve seen what i' ve done .
well , i did my time walking the beat .
i did that shit for a long time .
and ?
my badge says detective , the same as yours .
look , i made a decision .
i had to consider the integrity of the scene .
couldn' t worry whether you thought ... you were getting enough time on the playing field .
hey , man ... just don' t jerk me off .
that' s all i ask .
don' t jerk me off .
he' s been dead a long time ... and i can tell you it was not a poison .
oh , man .
how does someone let themselves go like that ?
it took four orderlies just to get him on the table .
but how' d the fat fuck ever fit out his front door ?
please .
it' s obvious he was a shut in .
look at this .
see how big this stomach is ?
and the strange thing is stretches .
look at the size of the cardiac orifice ... where the food ...
i see , but that means nothing to me .
he' s got lines of distention across the duodenum ... and the interior wall is ripped open .
this man ate till he burst ?
he didn' t really burst , not all the way ... but he was hemorrhaging internally .
there was a hematoma in the rectus .
so he did die by eating .
yes and no .
what about these bruises up here ?
i haven' t figured that out yet .
gun pressed against his head ?
pressed hard enough , sure .
fuck , yeah .
marks from the front side flush with the muzzle .
ladies and gentlemen , we have ourselves a homicide .
killer put a bucket beneath him , kept on serving .
took his time , too .
coroner said this could' ve gone on more than twelve hours .
victim' s throat was swollen , probably from the effort ... and there was definitely a point when he passed out .
the killer kicked him , and he burst .
sadistic fucker , huh ?
when you want somebody dead , you drive by and shoot them .
you don' t risk the time it takes to do this ... unless the act itself has meaning .
come on .
somebody had a problem with the fat boy ... and decided to torture him .
simple as that .
ln the grocery bags , we found two receipts .
that means the killer stopped in the middle ... and made a second trip to the supermarket .
so ?
hey , man , it' s his thing .
i' ve been out in the rain all day .
this is beginning .
we' ve got one dead guy , not three .
no motive .
don' t even start your big brain cooking on this .
please .
i' d like to be reassigned .
what ?
what in the hell are you talking about ?
this can' t be my last duty .
it' s just going to go on and on .
you' re retiring .
six more days and you' re all the way gone .
won' t be the first time you' ve left unfinished business .
those cases were taken as close to conclusion as possible ... and if i may speak freely ...
we' re all friends here .
this should not be his first assignment .
come on !
i knew it .
this is not my first assignment , dick .
it' s too soon for him .
i' m here .
you can say that shit to my face .
it' s too soon .
captain , if we can just talk in private .
this isn' t working .
it' s a personal thing .
shut up , mills .
look .
i don' t have anyone else to put on this .
this is metro .
you don' t get to swap .
give it to me .
say what ?
he doesn' t want it , fuck him .
sorry .
see you later .
have a nice time .
give it to me .
no .
i' m putting you on something else .
go on , mills .
just go on .
i' m sorry , old buddy ... but it looks like you' re stuck cleaning up the fat man .
all right .
here we go .
quiet down .
calm down .
calm down .
quiet down !
now , here' s how it' s going to be ...
i' il answer questions for ten minutes only .
if those questions do not come ... in a calm , sane , and orderly fashion ...
i' m on my way out .
detective ?
can i have a moment of your time ?
i will not discuss the details of this ongoing investigation ... so don' t bother asking .
there he is .
that' s the guy .
it looks like we won' t be eating dinner .
who is this kid , anyway ?
hotshot .
what have you guys gotfor me ?
nothing yet , boss .
why don' t you guys go get a coffee ?
we have this breaking story for you .
we' re going live downtown where defense attorney eli gould ... was found murdered this morning .
district attorney martin talbot is taking questions .
conflict of interest between your office ...
that is ridiculous to the point of being offensive .
there is no conflict whatsoever ... and any claim there could be is irresponsible .
ls it true you' re far from apprehending a suspect ?
i' ve come from a meeting of law enforcement officials ... and they' ve assured me their very best men are on this .
this will be the very definition of swift justice .
pardon me , george .
come in .
have you heard the news ?
haven' t heard .
eli gould was found murdered this morning .
someone broke into his law firm and bled him to death ... wrote the word " greed " on the floor .
greed ?
ln blood .
mills is heading up the investigation .
excuse me .
could you not do that , please ?
well , goodfor him .
what in the hell are you going to do with yourself ... out there , somerset ?
i' il work , maybe on a farm , fix my house .
don' t you feel that feeling ?
you' re not going to be a cop anymore .
that' s the whole idea .
i don' t think you' re leaving .
hell , you can' t leave all this .
a guy' s out walking his dog , gets attacked .
his watch is taken , his wallet .
while he' s lying there on the sidewalk helpless ... his attacker stabs him in both eyes .
this happened last night about four blocks from here .
i read about it .
i don' t understand this place any longer .
it' s the way it' s always been .
maybe you' re right .
you do this work , you were made for it ... and i don' t think you can deny that .
maybe i' m wrong .
the coroner sent this down for you .
found them in the fat boy' s stomach mixed with the food .
looks like plastic .
set them on the desk , please .
they were fed to him .
oh , lord .
this was found on the wall behind the refrigerator ... at the obesity murder scene .
long is the way and hard ...
that out of hell leads up to light .
it' s from milton .
paradise lost .
all right .
i' m confused .
it means that this is beginning .
this was found behind the same refrigerator ... written in grease .
there are seven deadly sins , captain .
gluttony ... greed ... sloth , wrath , pride , lust ... and envy .
seven .
hold on .
this is not even my desk .
you can expect five more of these .
now wait a minute .
i can' t get involved in this .
he wanted it .
damn .
i' m all over it .
where you headed ?
far away from here .
thanks , george .
how you doing ?
i' ve got a few things to look up .
sit where you' d like .
how' s everybody ?
hi there , smiley .
come on , george .
your cards are getting cold .
duty calls .
gentlemen , gentlemen .
i' il never understand .
all these books ... a world of knowledge at yourfingertips .
what do you do ?
play poker all night .
we got culture !
we got culture coming out our ass .
all right !
how' s this for culture ?
smiley , you really going to miss us .
i just might .
fucking dante .
goddamned poetry rhyming faggot piece of shit !
fucker !
good work , officer .
thank you , lord .
sorry .
be out of your way in a second .
you want your chair ?
no .
you go right ahead .
phone .
it' s a package deal .
it comes with the office .
are you ok ?
ls something wrong ?
you dingleberry .
i told you not to call me at work .
yeah .
why ?
why ?
it' s my wife .
sorry ?
she' d like to speak to you .
this is detective somerset .
well , it' s nice to talk to you , too .
i appreciate the offer , but ...
well , in that case , i' d be delighted .
yes , thank you very much .
hon , what ...
well ?
sorry ?
i' ve been invited to a late supper at your apartment .
i accepted .
how' s that ?
tonight .
hello , men .
hi , loser .
hi , idiot .
this is tracy .
tracy , somerset .
happy to meet you .
i' ve heard a lot about you .
except , of course , your first name .
it' s william .
it' s a good name , william .
william , i' d like you to meet david .
david , this is william .
i' il be right back .
how are the kids ?
good .
they' re in their room .
come on in .
oh , good dogs !
how are you ?
smells good .
what ?
the ...
yeah .
i mean , thank you .
please , have a seat .
would you like something to drink ?
no, thanks .
i' il wait .
just throw that anywhere .
excuse all this mess .
we' re still unpacking .
i understand you two were high school sweethearts .
pretty hokey , huh ?
you know something ?
i knew on ourfirst date i was going to marry him .
really ?
he was the funniest guy i' d ever met .
really ?
well , it' s kind of rare nowadays , you know ... that level of commitment .
don' t worry .
i won' t wear it to the dinner table .
i ...
no matter how often i see guns ...
i can' t get used to them .
same here .
why aren' t you married , william ?
trace .
what the hell ?
i was close once .
just didn' t happen .
it surprises me .
it really does .
anyone who spends a significant amount of time with me ... finds me disagreeable .
ask your husband .
very , very true .
so how long have you lived here ?
too long .
how are you liking it ?
you know , takes time to settle in .
it' il be good .
you get numb after a while .
there are things to any city ...
the subway .
it' il go away in a minute .
it' s nothing .
that real estate guy .
fucking piece of ...
sorry , hon .
shows us the place a few times .
i think it' s good .
trace likes it .
then i start wondering why he only brings us here ... five minutes at a time .
we found out the first night .
the soothing , relaxing , vibrating home , huh ?
i' m sorry .
all right , laugh it up .
i don' t know what you' re laughing at .
all right already .
the guy had to get into the building ... before the office was closed and security tightened .
gould would have been working late .
i' m certain .
biggest defense lawyer in town .
lnfamous , really .
the body was found tuesday morning .
the office was closed monday .
the guy could have gotten in on friday ...
laid low till the cleaning crew left ... and had his way all day saturday , sunday , maybe monday .
look at this .
gould was bound , his right arm free .
he was handed a butcher' s knife .
check out the scale .
a pound of flesh ?
one pound of flesh , no more , no less .
no cartilage , no bone , but only flesh .
merchant of venice .
didn' t see it .
his task done , then he would go free .
that chair was soaked with sweat .
of course .
the killer would have wanted gould to take his time ... to sit and decide which cut to make first .
lmagine it there' s a gun in yourface .
which part of your body is expendable ?
how about the love handle ?
cut along the side of his own stomach .
let' s take a fresh look at these .
even though the corpse is there , look through it .
edit out the initial shock .
the trick is to find one item , one detail ... and focus on it until it' s an exhausted possibility .
i' m going to get another beer .
beer ?
wine , please .
he' s preaching .
he' s punishing .
the sins were used in medieval sermons .
there were seven cardinal virtues ... and seven deadly sins used as teaching tools .
like in " the parson' s tale , " and what' s his ...
dante .
you read them .
parts .
remember in " purgatory , " dante and his buddy ... they' re climbing up the hill , checking out the sinners ?
yeah .
the seven terraces of purgation .
right , but pride comes first , not gluttony .
let' s consider that the books were the inspiration .
the sermons were about atonementfor sin .
these murders are like forced attrition .
forced what ?
attrition .
when you regret your sins but not because you love god .
because someone' s sticking a fucking gun in yourface .
no fingerprints .
totally unrelated victims .
and no witnesses of any kind .
which i don' t get because the fucker had to get back out .
ln any major city , minding your own business is a science .
first thing they teach women in rape prevention ... is never cry for help .
always yell " fire .
nobody answers " help .
holler " fire , " they come running .
that' s fucked up .
must have left another puzzle piece .
know what ?
thank you for talking this out ... but i got to sleep , walk the dogs .
this is to satisfy my curiosity .
i' m still leaving at the end of the week .
shit .
wait .
gould' s wife was out of town ... except this means she saw something .
what if it' s a threat ?
i put her in a safe house .
she wasn' t happy about it .
what if it isn' t something she has seen ... but something she' s supposed to see ... but hasn' t been given a chance ?
what ?
i don' t know .
but that' s the one thing .
sign us in .
we' ve got to see mrs. gould .
we want you to have a phone line , but ...
mrs. gould ?
mrs. gould , i am sorry .
i truly am .
i don' t understand .
i need you to look at each photo very carefully .
see if there' s anything strange or out of place ... anything at all .
i don' t see anything .
you sure ?
please , i can' t do this right now !
it' s got to be now .
there may be something we haven' t seen .
wait .
what ?
here .
this painting is upside down .
you sure your men didn' t move this ?
no .
those shots were taken before forensics .
nothing .
there' s got to be something .
moved the screws to rehang it .
what the fuck is that ?
switchblade .
god damn it !
must be something .
he didn' t paint the fucking thing .
now he' s fucking with us .
that' s what he' s doing .
see this ?
this is us .
just wait a minute .
now somerset' s climbing on the furniture .
just wait a minute .
you' re kidding me .
call the print lab .
