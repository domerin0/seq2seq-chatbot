typical of victor von doom to build a 30 foot statue of himself .
well , it' s obviously aimed at first time visitors ... to create feelings of smallness , inadequacy .
good thing it ain' t working .
reed , what are we doing here ?
this guy' s fast food , strip mall science .
this wasn' t our first stop , in case you forgot .
besides , victor' s not that bad .
he' s just a little larger than life .
my research suggests that exposure to a high energy cosmic storm ... borne on solar winds might have triggered the evolution of early planetary life .
in six weeks , another cloud with the same elemental profile ... will pass earth' s orbit .
a study conducted in space could fundamentally advance our knowledge ... about the structure of the human genome , cure countless diseases ... extend human life , give kids a chance to live longer , stronger , healthier
turn it off , please .
i don' t think i have explained my proposal fully .
no , i think you have .
same old reed , always stretching , reaching for the stars ... with the weight of the world on his back .
but dreams don' t pay the bills , do they ?
you remember , when we were in school we talked about working together .
well , that' s what i was about to explain .
the storm is deadly .
but the shields on your station' s control room ... are designed to protect any occupants inside .
so it' s not just my money you want .
it' s my toys .
tell me , if nasa doesn' t trust you , then why should l ?
that' s my job , to stay a step ahead .
to know what other men don' t .
i can' t take this .
ben , this is business , just work .
he' s right , ben .
it is just business .
i think you both know my director of genetic research , susan storm .
one more thing he' s got .
hey , susie .
hey .
it' s so nice to see you .
how' s debbie ?
great .
great .
how have you been ?
never better .
this isn' t going to be a problem , is it ?
no .
not at all .
good .
then you' re just in time to hear the great reed richards ... ask me for help .
you know , you made a lot of folks at mlt feel like a junior high science fair .
so you' il excuse me if i savour the moment .
you back this mission and i' il sign over a fair percentage of any application
the number' s 75 % .
and its applications and patents .
what about his first born ?
ben ....
come on .
25 %% of a billion is enough to keep the lights on for a while , isn' t it ?
maybe even pay off your fourth mortgage on the baxter building .
deal ?
well , then .
to our future .
together !
it' s funny how things turn out , isn' t it ?
hilarious .
he knew about nasa .
maybe he made the call to shut us down .
ben , think about all the people we can help if this works .
look , we got what we wanted .
that' s enough .
a few days in space , it' il be great .
what' s the worst that can happen ?
if reed' s right , this little trip could double our stock offerings .
and if he' s not ....
reed' s always right .
good thing he doesn' t always know what he' s got .
reed , you should know those solar winds have been picking up speed .
i factored them into my coordinates .
right , of course you did .
in theory .
it' s a little different once you' re out there .
i can assure you l  when are we leaving ?
i' il be scheduling the launch ... so you can call me in the morning for resources and crew .
i think i remember the number .
it' s been changed .
as far as crew , i was hoping ben could pilot the mission .
we already have a pilot on our payroll , but you' re welcome to ride shotgun .
remember my brother , johnny ?
can' t do it .
cannot do it .
external srbs , orbital system engines , it' s just like the shuttle you flew .
no !
i cannot take orders from the underwear model .
come on now , ben .
that wingnut washed out of nasa ... for sneaking two victoria' s secret wannabes into a flight simulator .
youthful high spirits .
they crashed it into a wall .
a flight simulator .
when have i ever asked you to do something ... you absolutely said you could not do ?
five times .
i had it at four .
well , this makes five .
attention , all personnel .
commencing launch sequence in six hours .
i miss you already , debs .
captain on the bridge !
digital camera : $254 .
memory stick : $59 .
priceless .
thank you .
that' s so sweet .
i can handle the ship .
i can even handle mr. blond ambition .
but i don' t know whether i should be flying or doing swan lake in these suits .
i mean , who the hell came up with these ?
victor did .
the synthetics act as a second skin , adapting to your body' s individual needs .
see , now that means it keeps the hot stuff hot ... and it keeps the cool stuff cool .
wow .
fantastic .
material made from self regulating unstable molecules .
i' ve been working on a formula for this .
great minds think alike .
here you go , ben .
thanks , sweetie .
reed .
eta until cosmic event : nine hours .
if you' re good , maybe next time daddy' il let you drive .
you keep talking and there won' t be a next time .
long way from the projection booth at the hayden planetarium , isn' t it ?
yes .
yes , it is .
we can monitor the cloud' s approach and observe the tests from here .
is it safe ?
the shields on the station should protect us .
should ?
what' s the matter , ben ?
getting paranoid in your old age ?
let' s start loading those samples .
get your suit ready , ben .
so i see you' re still doing all the heavy lifting .
maybe you should have stayed in the lab .
fieldwork never suited you .
he does the talking , i do the walking .
got it ?
so take a walk , ben .
actually , if you' il all excuse me , i need to borrow susan for a moment .
sure .
please tell me your guy' s not trying to rekindle things with my sister again .
of course not .
it' s strictly business .
yes , well , his eyes say differently , don' t they ?
two hearts got busted last time .
maybe she' s not over it , either .
wow , dr. phil , that' s deep .
let' s think about that .
you got victor , more money than god , stud of the year .
and you got reed , world' s dumbest smart guy , worth less than a postage stamp .
that' s a real toss up .
don' t trouble your tiny little mind .
don' t wander off now , boy .
securing airlock chamber .
surprised i agreed to reed' s proposal ?
i understand the business reasons .
well , when you' re looking at your future ... it doesn' t hurt to find closure about the past .
susan , every man dreams he' il meet a woman he can give the world to .
in my case , it' s not just a metaphor .
opening viewing station shield .
that can' t be right .
event threshold in t minus 9 minutes , 47 seconds .
that' s impossible .
it should be seven hours .
we' ve been together two years now .
it' s been a good two years , victor .
the company' s accomplished so much .
right , of course , the company .
but , you see , i' ve come to realise that all the accomplishments in the world ... mean nothing without someone to share them with .
i' ve lived my life unafraid of taking big steps .
now it' s time to take the biggest step of all .
victor .
lf it helps , think of this as a promotion .
victor , l  i have four words .
four little words that can change our lives forever .
the cloud is accelerating .
we' ve got minutes until it hits , not hours .
victor , that storm is deadly .
we need to abort .
get a grip , reed .
we didn' t come all this way to lose our nerve at the first glitch .
just close the shields .
ben is still out there .
so reel him in .
but we came here to do a job , so let' s do it quickly .
victor , reed' s right .
we have less than six minutes !
ben , you need to get inside now .
what' s going on ?
i ain' t done arranging your flowers yet , egghead .
ben , turn around !
guys , i' m not gonna make it .
ben , you gotta jump .
it' s the only way !
what are you doing ?
closing the shields .
you can' t just leave them out there .
watch me .
you can' t help them any more than i can .
i can try .
come on , ben , you got it !
okay , johnny , get ready to close the portal .
wake up .
ben .
rise and shine , big boy .
how you feeling ?
where am l ?
back on earth .
we' re in quarantine .
victor' s medical facility .
reed ?
sue ?
they' re fine .
everybody else is fine .
what' s wrong with me ?
i swear to you , ben .
they' ve done everything humanly possible .
the best plastic surgeons in the world are here , ben .
you had the best .
give me that mirror .
i don' t know if that' s a good idea .
they said the shock alone  i said give me that goddamn mirror !
okay , ben , just be strong .
unfortunately , the doctors just couldn' t do anything to fix your face .
hi .
hey .
nice do .
i' m liking the grandpa look .
what ?
how' s she doing ?
stable and her vitals are strong .
blood panels show no irradiation .
good .
you' il step up this protocol every  every four hours , yes .
we know what we' re doing .
another day of observation and you' re all clear .
excuse me .
more flowers from mr. von doom .
she' s allergic to orchids .
put the sunflowers by her bed , they' re her favourites .
well , victor ... the bank would like to congratulate you ... on the fastest freefall since the depression .
we can' t even give your stock away .
ned , you know i can turn this around .
well , you' re going to have to , victor , or we pull out .
you have a week .
you' re enjoying this , aren' t you , ned ?
one week .
where do we think we' re going ?
i don' t know if we' ve noticed ... but the sickest runs this side of the alps are right outside that window .
yeah , i' ve noticed , but there are rules here .
you can' t leave until we  until we' ve finish the tests .
i know , i' ve never been good with rules .
you let me know how those come out .
do you wanna help me with this zipper ?
you know , this is not a ski resort .
not yet .
luckily , grandma still sends care packages , though .
you know , it' s amazing , for an 80 year old woman , you' d be surprised ....
you are trouble .
trouble is my middle name .
you' re hot !
why , thank you .
so are you .
and i' m not afraid to cry .
no , i mean , you feel a little feverish .
well , i' ve never felt better in my life .
my god , you smell good .
listen , when do you get off work ?
4 : 00 , but l  tell you what .
you meet me at 4 : 01 at the top of the mountain .
that' il give you a minute to freshen up .
this is yours , that' s mine .
nurses !
how long was i out ?
hey .
three days .
man , i was worried about you .
how are you feeling ?
solid .
that was a close one , though , huh ?
yeah .
what was that about ?
i don' t know .
i really don' t know .
i' ve been going over the figures again and again and they all add up .
i just don' t understand .
maybe i should have aborted
reed , it was a freak of nature .
you couldn' t have possibly predicted it .
let it go .
you know , you live through something like this ... it really makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life .
yeah , you and debbie are perfect .
i' m not talking about debbie .
what ?
come on .
she' s got a good thing with victor .
he' s smart , he' s powerful , he' s successful
well , maybe you should date him then .
ben , she ended up with the right guy .
things worked out for the best .
do i have to do everything myself ?
all right .
i think you should stay to the right .
the left might give you trouble .
i think we should drop , like , 10 more feet .
good .
last one down springs for room service !
that' s my future wife .
you' re losing !
all right , no more kid' s stuff .
check this out .
you' re on fire .
thanks !
you' re pretty good , too .
no , you' re on fire .
look !
care to join me ?
i can only stay for one drink ' cause i have to meet victor .
well , wouldn' t want to keep vic waiting .
reed , what are you doing here ?
i thought ....
great !
maybe you can join us .
how' s the lpo now ?
it' s falling .
we' re looking at low 20s .
it' s a good number considering the fallout from
from reed' s disaster ?
get me on the a . m . shows , larry king , the cover of the journal .
i have to do something about this scar .
make sure they only shoot me from my left side .
actually , the scar' s tracking well .
people seem to think it humanises you .
and that' s a good thing ?
you know , maybe you should get some rest .
later .
first , i have some unfinished business .
a deal that needs closing .
sir , i have always wondered , why sue ?
you could have any other woman in the world .
that' s why .
because i could have any other woman .
no , let me tell the story .
no , let him tell the story .
you all right ?
yeah , bad shrimp .
i think i better go lie down .
excuse me .
oh , god !
so , you feeling better ?
yes , thank you .
good .
that' s ... good .
you always had a way with words .
wow .
i should be going because ...
i have to meet victor .
i' m really happy for you and victor .
you' re really happy for me and victor ?
i can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship .
which was ?
passion ... for science .
you' re such a dork , reed .
you never got it ... and you never will ...
well , what did i say ? ... unless it' s explained to you in quantum physics .
i just wanted to let you know that l
it' s been two years , and all you can say is that you' re happy ... for me and some other guy ?
victor may be a lot of things .
but at least he' s not afraid to fight for what he wants .
it' s nice to be wanted sometimes , reed .
to be seen and heard .
look at me .
i can' t .
what do you mean , you can' t ?
look at me !
sue , look at your hands !
hey , you guys .
you are never gonna believe what just happened to me .
what ?
well , i can explain this .
it has to be the cloud .
it' s fundamentally altered our dna .
let' s not jump to conclusions .
we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap .
guys , look !
now , picture that , but everywhere .
it was everywhere .
what ?
the cloud has fundamentally altered our dna .
cool !
we need to find ben .
and you know what , guys ?
i think i was flying .
i said , cut it out , johnny .
i' m getting the hang of it .
ben , it' s reed .
stop .
all right .
all right ?
yes .
god !
god ?
what' s wrong with you ?
what ?
sue , do you know the code ?
i might .
ben , open up .
you all right , ben ?
does somebody have keys to these doors ?
anybody ?
just break the glass .
it can' t be that thick .
give me another couple of seconds , guys .
i almost got it .
that' s gross .
ben ?
look .
what is that thing ?
what' s going on ?
what happened in here ?
victor , are you feeling all right ?
i' m fine .
just a few scrapes , that' s all .
ben did this .
he' s had some kind of reaction to exposure from the cloud .
we all have different symptoms .
symptoms ?
victor , i should have  just find him .
anybody got any ideas where the big guy' s going ?
he' s going home .
you gotta be kidding me .
little buttons .
hello , operator ?
hello ?
debs ?
it' s me .
ben ?
are you all right ?
you sound a little different .
listen , i need you to come out front .
out front ?
you' re home , baby ?
yeah .
i got a surprise for you .
yeah , i got a little one for you , too .
ben ?
where are you ?
i' m over here .
don' t come any closer for a sec , okay ?
it' s gonna be a bit of a shock .
honey , what' s going on ?
debs ... remember when we used to say ... together forever no matter what ?
yeah .
well ....
baby , you' re scaring me .
oh , my god .
deb , it' s me .
it' s still me .
it was the accident .
let me explain .
no !
don' t touch me !
debs !
i' m calling the police .
everybody all right ?
i saw him .
it' s that guy over there !
okay , so he was there last night .
debbie' s gonna meet us on the other side of the bridge .
yeah , ben .
a few days in space .
it' il be great .
what' s the worst that could happen ?
hey , little guy .
you' re not afraid of me , are you ?
perfect .
thanks .
hey !
you think you' ve got problems ?
you take a good look , pal .
how bad could it be , right ?
i don' t think you ....
okay , pal .
take it easy .
no , don' t go out there .
look , i said stop , you fruitcake !
no .
come close .
that' s further .
come closer .
i said , stop !
no !
come here .
all right , calm down .
you wanna be scared ?
fine !
no !
get back , everybody !
get back in your vehicle .
we' il tell you when you can go .
what do we do now ?
we' re not going to get past these guys .
but you could .
sorry about the truck , pal .
come on .
a little help , here ?
you wanna hit the button , sir ?
it' s stuck .
sue , your clothes .
lose them .
right .
this is so wrong .
wow , you' ve been working out .
shut up !
all right .
all right , freeze !
now just ....
just put the man in the seat down .
do it !
any more great ideas ?
why don' t you strip down and have a 100 people stare at you ?
sue .
what ?
i' m gonna need therapy .
come on , let' s get out of here .
excuse me .
coming through .
all right , now just back away from him .
and i want you to put your hands on your head ....
954 approaching scene .
i still can' t believe you made me do that .
we got through , didn' t we ?
just find ben .
ben !
mum .
stay here , okay ?
i' m coming .
hold on .
hang on !
i got you .
get down on the ground .
get down on the ground now !
ben .
i swear to you ...
i will do everything in my power ... until there is not a breath left in me .
you' re going to be ben again .
i told you i felt fine .
where are your ears ?
there are some folks outside that want to talk to you .
we' re not going public with this .
we' re scientists , not celebrities .
it' s too late , son .
look .
... when a new york fire department ladder truck ...
see that ? ... became part of the tragedy .
but the rescue itselfis not the story .
one of the four stretched to an amazing length ....
that' s what they' re calling you .
the fantastic four .
cool .
no , wait !
where are you going ?
i' m gonna go talk to them .
no , we should think this through .
that' s great .
brainstorm .
get back here , right now .
johnny !
settle down .
do you believe this ?
which one of you is the leader ?
that would be me .
no , seriously .
okay , son .
you' re on .
during our recent mission to the von doom space station ... we were exposed to as yet unidentified radioactive energy .
what happened on the bridge ?
how can you stretch ?
were you really on fire ?
ls it true you can fly ?
yeah , i' m working on it .
it' s actually really difficult .
no , actually , we do not know much more than you do at this point .
sir , larry king just cancelled .
apparently , there' s a bigger story .
actually , here they come now .
you had to see it to believe it , folks .
the man ....
... named the fantastic four ....
we' il be going directly to our lab to diagnose our symptoms .
symptoms ?
is this some kind of disease ?
no .
it' s not a disease .
if having special powers is a disease , then , yeah , we got it bad .
excuse me , that thing doesn' t look so fantastic .
ben grimm is a genuine american hero .
what he means is , every team needs a mascot .
a new day is dawning .
the day of the fantastic four .
look !
we went up to space to find a way to understand dna ... cure disease , save lives .
well , now it' s our dna , our disease , our lives on the line .
thank you .
no more questions .
this is how you turn things around ?
these freaks on the front page ?
your company' s in the obituaries ?
i was planning to use the publicity .
the board' s in agreement , the bank' s lost enough already .
wait a minute .
it' s too late , victor .
do you know how much money i' ve invested in this company ?
victor , stop .
this isn' t a negotiation .
it' s a notification .
we' re pulling out .
is all that for you , dr. richards ?
i' m afraid so .
come on , ben , smile .
they want to like you , ben .
say hi .
don' t do drugs .
welcome back to the baxter , dr. richards .
i' ve got the usual for you .
good to have you back , sir .
thanks , willie .
we had a tough year .
yeah , like nine straight .
either we' re moving really fast or not at all .
i' il take the stairs .
how come ben can' t turn it on and off like we can ?
that' s what we' re here to find out .
i mean , if it happened to him ....
what ?
you mean , like , we won' t be able to turn it off , either ?
that would save time .
you don' t really wanna walk around on fire for the rest of your life , do you ?
ls that a trick question ?
grow up .
come on .
am i the only guy who thinks this is cool ?
we should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes ... and figure out how to reverse them .
but i have to warn you , it' s gonna be a little crowded in some areas .
so , what do you think ?
i don' t know , reed , i think you might be bringing your work home with you .
come on .
let me show you guys where you' il be staying .
busy guy .
mr. von doom , would you like to comment on the recent failure of your lpo ?
what about the rumours of a takeover ?
god , i was so worried about you .
victor .
i' m sorry i didn' t get a chance to call .
please .
no apologies .
i' ve arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos .
you' il have round the clock care .
thank you .
that' s very generous of you .
but i think i should stay here with my brother ... until we get a handle on things .
susan , i think you should let my doctors have a look at you .
victor , what are you doing here ?
i' m starting to wonder the same thing .
how much do you know about what happened to you ?
not much .
we need to run tests to see the extent of the damage .
well , you let me know what i can do .
we' re all in this together now .
victor , wait .
i just wanted to say i' m sorry the mission didn' t go as planned .
didn' t go as planned ?
it was a catastrophe .
you ruined the lives of four people .
with all due respect , we' re both to blame .
i told you to abort .
abort ?
i put my company , my name , billions of dollars on the line .
i will not let you make me look like a fool .
victor , if we can understand
i don' t wanna understand it !
this isn' t one of your science projects !
i just wanna fix it .
fast !
is there a problem ?
no .
no problem , ben .
just pay your damn electric bill and get to work on finding a cure .
he' s heating up from his core .
and his vitals are completely normal .
if we' re going to identify the source of the mutation ... we need to isolate your recombinant dna ... so we can activate positional genomes .
we have to do a physical in order to see what got zapped .
why didn' t you just say so ?
his internal organs are completely solid .
how bad is it ?
you know , i used to smoke .
it' s not invisibility per se .
you should be able to bend light around other objects , even people ... if you could control your emotional state better .
excuse me ?
i' m saying , if you had a little more self control , you could locate the trigger .
can you remember your exact emotions on the bridge ?
anger .
rage .
frustration .
okay .
is there any way to duplicate that feeling ?
some memory or ....
i' m sure i can come up with something .
you feel anything ?
nope .
okay .
it' s hotter than i anticipated .
okay , johnny , back it down .
i can go hotter !
johnny , just back it down .
johnny , back it down right now !
johnny !
buzz kill !
you guys are cramping my style .
johnny , you were at 4, 000 kelvin .
any hotter and you' re approaching supernova .
sweet !
no , not sweet !
that' s the temperature of the sun .
not only could you kill yourself ... but you could set fire to earth' s atmosphere ... and destroy all human life as we know it .
got it .
supernova : bad .
how' s that coming ?
i' m so sorry .
are you okay ?
yeah , fine .
you sure ?
yeah .
i ....
you probably thought that was some form of latent hostility .
what in the world would give me that idea ?
i mean , you broke up with me , right ?
are you kidding ?
no .
i distinctly remember , you walked out my door , ergo
i was ready for the next step , you weren' t .
ergo , i walked .
i think it was a little bit more complicated than that .
i just wanted to share an apartment .
what was so complicated about that ?
there were a lot of variables to consider .
no , there weren' t .
there was you and me .
there were no variables , no math .
it was actually the simplest thing in the world .
but like always , reed , your head got in the way .
no , it didn' t .
then what was it ?
did you feel anything when i left ?
do you feel anything right now ?
hey , guys .
i think we have a serious problem .
so what' s the prognosis ?
your tissue , your organs , your entire biophysical structure is changing .
every system is still functioning somehow .
and it' s changing into ?
i don' t really know .
some kind of organic metallic alloy ... stronger than titanium or carbon steel , harder than diamonds .
like the shields reed said would protect us .
how long ?
at this rate , the infection could be complete in two , maybe three weeks .
what do you mean complete ?
i wish i could tell you .
i can' t pretend to know what we' re dealing with here .
i' il have to notify the cdc .
what ?
centre for disease control .
i know what it is .
if this thing is contagious , we may have a big problem on our hands .
we' re talking about an epidemic here .
look at me .
i have a life .
i' m the face of a billion dollar company .
we need to keep this confidential .
victor , this disease is progressive , degenerative .
i have to notify someone
that' s terrible news .
but i think i' il get a second opinion .
our uniforms were exposed to the storm , like us .
so they can transform like us .
becoming invisible , changing size on demand or remaining impervious to flame .
you guys look like an ' 80s rock band .
you know , ben , this material stretches .
i' m sure i can figure out a way to make it fit .
i wouldn' t be caught dead wearing that .
i love these costumes .
they' re missing something , though .
needs , like , spice .
they' re not costumes .
you can' t use your powers in public , johnny .
you guys are worse than nasa .
you could burn somebody .
maybe it' s missing a utility belt .
here you go , there' s your change .
can i help you , buddy ?
oh , my .
it' s sue storm , it' s the lnvisible woman !
sue storm , it is you .
listen , my kid loves you !
i can' t believe i' m doing this again .
reed , we really can' t go outside anymore .
we are on the cover of every publication from people
all right , i' m here , let' s make this quick .
i got a lot of places to go today .
oh , wait .
i don' t go anywhere .
johnny , it' s imperative that we stay inside for the foreseeable future .
i know , but when you said that last time , my brain heard a week .
johnny , it' s too dangerous for you to be in public .
you' ve been saying that for years .
what worries me is that our powers are evolving .
i know !
i am so close to flying , guys , i can taste it .
you can' t fly .
yet .
johnny , can you put that napkin out ?
jesus .
so what' s going on , reed ?
how' re you going to cure us ?
i' m going to build a machine to recreate the storm .
the cosmic rays will travel from this generator to this chamber .
what , no pop ups ?
lf i can reverse the wave signal  it' il return us back to normal .
right .
but what are the risks ?
even a small miscalculation could increase our symptoms exponentially ... or perhaps even kill us .
now , dying .
that' s bad , right ?
i say we just let sleeping dogs lie , guys .
so how long till this contraption' s up and running ?
i don' t know , it' s hard to say .
how long , reed ?
i don' t know .
you don' t know ?
you don' t want this to get worse .
worse than that ?
guys , look , we' re gonna be stuck here for a while , so let' s just try and get along .
you could knock !
sorry !
johnny !
more bad news for von doom lndustries today as ned cecil announced ... that his group ofinvestors would seek to gain control ... of victor von doom ' s numerous technology companies .
earlier , the lpo was pulled from the market ... after the steady decline of its projected opening price .
von doom lndustries was never able to overcome the negative publicity ....
interesting .
hello ?
victor ?
what' s with these lights , huh ?
about the lpo , no hard feelings , right ?
nothing personal .
you know , you could always move back to latveria .
start fresh .
maybe that' s where you belong , the old country .
nothing personal , ned .
but i' m not going anywhere .
... assassinated the competition everywhere this season .
truly unbelievable .
the crowd is going nuts here at the arena .
i tell you , if there' s anybody out there who can do what these guys do ... we dare you to come on down here .
look at this spread eagle ... no arm , back of the seat .
motorbike grab , landed ....
i got to get out of here .
hey , pretty boy , let' s see what you got .
where' s your hot sister and the monster ?
let' s go !
all right .
i want you all to make a lot ofnoise now for a very special guest .
mr. johnny storm from the fantastic four !
look at that lift !
that was fantastic !
but , johnny , come on .
that' s old school .
show us something new .
something new .
you got it .
come on , johnny , come on !
is he flying ?
wait , no !
that' s dangerous .
i' m okay , i' m all right , i' m good .
he' s okay !
he' s all right !
johnny storm , ladies and gentlemen !
i have to give you props , johnny !
you were on fire !
he didn' t .
oh , yes , he did .
flame boy never listens .
what did he do to his uniform ?
johnny , i' ve gotta ask you about this outfit .
yeah , it' s sort of armani meets astronaut .
so what are your superhero names ?
they call me the human torch .
ladies call me torch .
what about the rest of the team ?
that' s the lnvisible girl .
girl ?
what about your leader , reed richards ?
i hear you call him mr. fantastic .
could' ve been worse .
i guess .
is it true what they say about him that he can expand any part ofhis anatomy ?
well , i' ve always found him to be a little limp .
what is that ?
what do you call that thing ?
that' s it .
the thing .
yeah , you think this is bad , you should ha ve seen him before .
okay .
now i' m gonna go kill him .
there he is .
johnny !
can we talk about this later , guys ?
no .
we can' t talk about this later .
we can do this at home .
what are you thinking ?
where' s my ride ?
you think that' s funny , pebbles ?
johnny !
what ?
you gave us names ?
you don' t think .
so now you' re the face of the fantastic four ?
a face that' s about to be broken !
look , this isn' t permanent , johnny .
we need to be careful until we' re normal again .
what if i don' t wanna be normal ?
i didn' t turn into a monster !
ben !
did you just ....
johnny , stop it .
that' s it , tinkerbell !
no , ben .
you wanna fly ?
then fly !
wait a minute , guys !
ben , don' t do this !
let' s see if we can get blood from a stone .
let' s see .
bring it , burnout !
you two need a time out !
talk to blockhead , he started it .
i don' t care .
damn it , johnny .
ben , wait !
what ?
you need to control yourself and think before you act .
yeah , but see , that' s your problem .
you always think , you never act .
what if we got these powers for a reason ?
what if it' s like some higher calling ?
a higher calling ?
like getting girls and making money ?
is there any higher ?
you know what , reed ?
this is who we are .
accept it .
or better yet , enjoy it .
wait , ben , slow down .
he didn' t mean it .
you know johnny .
he' s always been a hothead .
it ain' t him .
it' s them !
i can' t live like this .
just give reed a little more time .
you know how he works .
analysing every little step before he takes one .
it' s easy for you to be patient .
no , it' s not !
i thought i was done waiting for reed , but i ....
we' re all in this together , ben .
together ?
susie , look at me .
you got no idea what i' d ....
what i' d give to be invisible .
thank you , gentlemen .
i' m just gonna pick up a few things ... for some friends .
perfect .
that' s not funny .
this is ben grimm here .
the first mook from brooklyn to go into outer space .
so pay him some respect .
just give me the usual and i' m out .
all right .
make it a double .
make it a triple .
put it on my tab , ernie .
all right , alicia .
appreciate it .
no problem .
it' s okay , ben .
if there' s a god , he hates me .
she is not so into hate .
if you could see me , you wouldn' t be saying that .
then let me see you .
can l ?
careful .
it' s okay .
so sad .
you know , being different isn' t always a bad thing .
trust me .
this ain' t one of them times .
not if you don' t want it to be .
all right , ernie , i' m out of here .
i' il take you .
see you later , benny .
i' m alicia , by the way .
thanks , ernie .
reed got what he wanted .
and everything he wanted ... he took from me .
now it' s time to take it back .
but first , i need to get rid of his bodyguard .
this seat taken ?
what are you doing here ?
i was worried about you .
you were worried about me ?
that' s sweet .
come on .
let me buy you something to eat .
looks like you could use the company .
reed ?
i was just resting my eyes .
so i see .
the new readouts look very promising .
not promising enough .
when are the next tests ?
i' ve run out of plans .
so i was thinking maybe ....
there' s always me .
no .
it' s too soon .
reed ?
i should get back to work .
you need a break .
sue , not now , please .
come on .
let' s go .
remember our first date here ?
god , i was nervous .
you know , i bribed the projectionist $10 to keep the place open late .
really ?
i gave him $20 .
no .
yeah .
no way .
yeah .
i didn' t want that night to end .
you were right .
it wasn' t complicated .
i just wasn' t ready to ....
you always talked about how you kind of liked the man ... who would approach you , speak his mind .
one who wasn' t afraid to tell you exactly what he wanted .
i did .
but i wanted you to be that man .
well , why didn' t you say something ?
reed , i' m saying it now .
excuse me .
i know it' s not easy .
life hasn' t changed that much for reed , sue , or johnny .
at least they can still go out in public .
but for you ....
if you' re trying to cheer me up , you' re doing a hell of a job .
you know what i mean , scarface ?
i' m just saying i know what it' s like to lose something that you love ... to see it slip away and know it' s never coming back .
look .
reed is gonna fix me up , okay ?
for your sake i hope you' re right .
look , he' s a brilliant man .
we should all trust that he' s working as hard as he can .
you' re his best friend .
so what possible reason could he have for taking his time ?
i mean , other than spending more time with sue .
wow , i had no idea .
it' s true .
yeah .
i have that effect on people .
ben .
so you remember my name now , do you ?
do you also remember what you swore to do ... with every breath in your body ?
we' re working as hard as we can .
yeah .
i can tell .
victor was right .
victor ?
ben , i don' t know if this thing will change us back or make us worse .
i need you to be patient for a little while longer .
reed , look at me !
i am looking .
that' s why i can' t make a mistake .
i' ve gotta get it right and it' s not right yet !
we need to test it !
i spent my whole life protecting you , and for what ?
so you can play twister with your girlfriend ... while i' m the freak of the week ?
ben , stop it !
you stay out of this , susie !
stop it , or i will .
get off me , rubber boy !
you guys , quit it .
calm down !
good thing you' re flexible enough to watch your own back .
' cause i ain' t doing it no more .
you two are on your own .
look what the marketing guys gave me .
look , check it out , listen .
you' re gonna love this .
it' s clobbering time !
it' s catchy , right ?
isn' t that great ?
that was the prototype .
johnny , have you seen ben ?
yeah , sunshine just left .
look , sue , i' m sorry .
i can' t stand this freak show .
i gotta get back to the real world .
you' re calling that the real world ?
sue , stop .
you' re not mum .
don' t talk to me like i' m a little boy , okay ?
maybe i would if you stopped acting like one .
do you even hear yourself ?
who do you think you are ?
why is everyone on my ass ?
if you guys are jealous , that' s fine .
i didn' t expect it to come from you , though .
you really think those people out there care about you ?
you' re just a fad to them , johnny !
let' s try something new .
you live your life , i' il live mine .
sound good ?
and just for the record , they love me !
oh , god .
reed .
oh , my god , reed .
what did you do ?
i can make it work .
no !
i need more power to control the storm .
more power ?
you need a doctor .
come with me .
sue .
one more try ....
you need to rest .
leonard , bring me our lab rat .
ben .
come in .
what is this ?
where' s reed ?
where do you think ?
with sue .
i' il take it from here , leonard .
yes , sir .
what do you want , vic ?
to help you .
the machine is ready .
but reed said it wouldn' t
he also said we' d avoid that storm in space ... but we all know how that turned out .
he couldn' t generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass .
yet another mistake for mr. fantastic .
and you can ?
yes .
tell me ... do you want to be ben grimm again ?
thank you .
vic ?
vic , it worked .
everyone thought i was safe behind those shields .
oh , my god .
the machine worked for me .
it can work for you , too !
it did , ben .
it worked perfectly .
you planned this .
i' ve always wanted power .
now i have an unlimited supply .
and no thing to stand in your way .
take a good look , ben .
this is what a man looks like who embraces his destiny .
one down , three to go .
vic ?
right on cue .
ben ?
what did you do ?
exactly what i said i would .
i built a better , stronger being .
and outsmarted the great reed richards .
if you' ve exposed yourself to the storm , you' re endangering your life .
you need help .
you always know best .
so tell me , what happens when you superheat rubber ?
no !
mr. von doom , are you okay ?
never better , jimmy .
why the long face ?
let' s talk in my office .
ben .
sue !
johnny , the machine worked !
give me a hand .
come on .
get his arm .
you all right , ben ?
put him on the step .
what happened , big guy ?
i leave you for five minutes ....
the machine .
vic used it on himself .
he was affected by the cloud like us .
where' s reed ?
vic must have taken him .
dr. richards , allow me to begin your lesson .
chemistry 101 .
what happens to rubber when it' s supercooled ?
give up ?
that' s not like you , reed .
after all , we' re both doctors .
painful ?
you don' t know the meaning of the word .
just a little something from our defence contracts .
let' s check in on the rest of the family , shall we ?
we gotta get out of here !
wait a minute .
i got an idea !
don' t even think about it .
never do .
what are you doing ?
johnny , no !
come on , flame on !
we have to help reed .
it' s too dangerous for you now .
you have to stay here .
what did i do ?
come on , think !
two down , two to go .
sue .
what has he done to you ?
how romantic .
victor , please .
call me doom .
the machine works .
it worked on ben , it can work on you .
we can turn you back .
do you really think fate turned us into gods so we could refuse these gifts ?
victor , you always thought you were a god .
now back off .
susan , let' s not fight .
no .
let' s .
susan , you' re fired !
marco .
polo .
did you say goodbye to your brother johnny ?
it' s time to end this !
no , vic .
it' s clobbering time .
damn , i' ve been waiting to do that .
susie , you okay ?
victor ain' t that bad , huh ?
he' s just a little larger than life, right ?
maybe next time you' il listen to me before ....
ben !
sorry , ladies .
stop the car !
pull over .
hit the brakes !
this is the police .
put your hands up and step down from the vehicle !
take him out !
ladies , i' m gonna need to borrow your car .
the transmission sticks .
not gonna be a problem .
i can' t let you do that !
reed ?
i' il be right with you .
hello , susan .
you three are pathetic .
you missed me .
had a little relapse , huh ?
welcome back .
this is gonna be fun .
i can' t hold it !
johnny , supernova !
i thought we agreed that was bad .
now !
ben !
gotcha .
sue !
think you can contain it ?
flame on , kid .
is that the best you can do ?
time for your lesson .
chem 101 .
what happens when you rapidly cool hot metal ?
ben !
you done good , kid .
come on .
sue , you okay ?
yeah .
man , i love this job .
job , huh ?
well , we do have the suits .
ladies , your drinks .
i don' t think we need another .
just one more .
thank you , thank you so much .
cheers !
i need names and shots .
bartender !
they' re custom made , 36 eeee .
well , look .
i' ve been crunching the numbers on the machine .
and i think if i can rework the power settings
forget about it , egghead .
i' m good as is .
better than good , baby .
you just need to work on your touch .
i like the sound of that .
can i talk to you for a second ?
sure .
thanks .
i found a broken gasket from space .
a gasket ?
reed , come on , we' re at a party .
and if one of us were to wear it ....
no more thinking .
no more variables .
sue storm ... will you marry me ?
sue , you kind of need to say something .
yes .
that' s my nose , genius .
these are my lips .
she' s kissing him .
that' s so cute .
about time , you guys .
no more wisecracks about the way i look .
call me mr. sensitivity .
okay .
wide load coming through .
everybody move , he' s huge .
come here , mr. sensitive .
flame on .
showoff !
how long will it be ?
should be about 12 days .
