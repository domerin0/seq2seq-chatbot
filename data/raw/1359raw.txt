did i hear home ? .
or was i wrong , then ? .
no , you' re right .
i' m matoban .
and a fair matoban , in fact .
king , you stay with that bus .
do you know who i am ? .
yes .
you' re a killer .
you ordered the murder of ajene xola .
you got a red light in that car ? .
why don' t you use it ? .
who told you this nonsense ? .
where' s my brother ? .
your brother ? .
i don' t even know who you are .
you are on the wrong bus , so to speak , to be so reckless .
your people arranged a meeting through philippe broullet .
you know him .
i don' t ... and i didn' t .
but the fact is , somebody wants you to believe that i killed ajene xola .
i don' t believe you .
but you should believe me .
why ? .
because i would form a coalition with xola .
neither of us have made enough progress alone .
he has the working people .
i have the finances .
if he is dead , it is a loss for all of us .
me especially .
we' re getting off .
i got the back room .
jesus .
clear the other room .
ok .
closet .
yeah .
i got the bed .
ho !
keller ? .
we got a dead body in the closet .
jamal ? .
yeah .
i' il call it in .
god , how can you see in here ? .
wait .
wait .
why the lanterns ? .
well , that' s just rude .
what do you do so far away from home ? .
i work .
and i hope .
same as me , then .
i doubt it .
you work for ... ? .
i' m an interpreter at the un .
so like the un .
layers of languages signifying nothing .
you' d prefer more war ? .
i prefer more business .
guys , get with me here .
we got a situation .
no , boss , we got a situation .
we just got on the 1 33 .
with mohammad .
and silvia broome .
and kuman kuman .
what ? .
you' re on the same bus ? .
with our subjects .
get off the bus , and get silvia broome off that bus now .
we can' t do that .
we' re moving .
doug , is the room mate carrying anything ? .
doug , is he carrying anything ? .
a satchel .
all right ... where is it ? .
it' s in his lap .
he' s been carrying it all day .
oh , man .
can either of you get to him ? .
not without gettin ' made .
despite all the flags on first avenue , there are no nations any more .
only companies .
international companies .
it' s where we are .
it' s what we are .
i think you' re wrong .
you are still young .
i' m an acquired taste .
what' s your brother' s name ? .
simon .
simon broome .
ok , we' re stopping .
you got guts , coming out here .
i' il see what my people can find out about him .
but remember , i' m not your brother' s keeper , eh ? .
yeah .
thank you .
come on , guys , talk to me .
what' s going on ? .
we' re stopped .
she' s getting off .
what' s going on ? .
and so is my subject .
keep talking to me .
what' s going on ? .
is he carrying the satchel ? .
ok , he' s got the satchel .
but i think he made me .
that' s ok , i got him .
kuman ? .
he' s staying put .
miss broome !
please get in the car .
move it !
i got gamba .
i' il stay with kuman .
no .
just get off that bus .
get everybody off that bus right now !
doug !
mohammad ? .
hey !
guy forgot his lunch .
oh , man .
i' m standing here on nostrand avenue in crown heights , at a scene that can only be described as unconscionable carnage . .. frantically helping victims of an apparent terrorist attack .
these events are more familiar in the cities of the middle east .
there is no word yet .
however , there are unconfirmed reports that kuman kuman , the exiled matoban revolutionary , may have been on board .
you all right ? .
i' m ok .
doug ? .
this is ron ferguson , reporting live on nostrand avenue in brooklyn , where just after 1 0 . 30 am this morning ...
we' re ok , boss .
.. the violence has now found its way into the heart of new york city ...
the death toll is 1 7 , with scores injured ...
the obvious speculation about al qaeda ... .. widely seen as the probable successor to edmond zuwanie ...
tunnels and bridges will close for at least 1 2 hours ... .. alleged terrorist attack by ajene xola ... ..
zuwanie is still planning to address the general assembly of the un .
what were you doing on that bus ? .
thank you for bringing me home .
hey !
i lost a man today .
a kid .
how do you know kuman ? .
i never met him before .
you think that not getting caught in a lie is the same as the truth !
i' m not lying .
i went to him for help .
with what ? .
i can' t tell you .
someone might get hurt .
someone might get hurt .
there' s a bus full of dead people !
someone might get hurt " ? .
who ? .
someone you know ? .
someone who' s mixed up in all this ? .
you ? .
why did you leave africa ? .
i told you .
no , you didn' t .
why did you come here ? .
stop it .
goddammit !
stop shouting at me !
stop lying !
i' m not lying !
stop lying !
i was just on that bus !
i can' t think with all this noise .
i can' t !
you have to stop !
that isn' t me .
don' t be ridiculous .
it isn' t me .
no , that is you .
and i know , because i drive you home , and i look at you through the binoculars , and everything else that i shouldn' t do .
it was once .
it' s not any more .
after the rallies , after my parents and sister were killed , then the rifles came out .
it was the only way to get anyone to listen .
just to listen .
i killed a boy who had nothing to live for beyond the money he' d get for killing me .
i shot him in the head so he wouldn' t shoot me .
then i handed the rifle to my brother and told him , " i' m through .
i walked away with him shouting at me , " you' re a coward .
our parents are dead , zuwanie' s alive .
my brother , who in another life wouldn' t harm a ...
that was the last thing he ever said to me .
the only contact i have is the notebooks i send and imagine him receiving .
i know he' s alive .
i know it .
but i' m not to him .
i lied to you because i was afraid .
i was afraid he might be involved in what i heard .
i lied to everyone else so they' d let me near the un , and that' s the only place that i believe has a chance to change any of this .
and i lied to you about ajene xola because ...
i loved him .
once .
until the colour of my skin became a problem .
the politics of my skin .
i walked away from africa with nothing .
no brother , no family , no lover , nothing .
just a belief that words and compassion are the better way .
even if it' s slower than a gun .
where are you going ? .
you' ve got blood all over your face .
you can' t say stuff like that with blood on your face .
this is precisely why dr zuwanie must be allowed to speak .
this monstrous act of terrorism was aimed at you ... .. and at the heart of the united nations .
i can' t listen to this .
do not allow them to intimidate you ... .. or dr zuwanie .
i' m not at liberty to tell you .
where we going ? .
bathroom .
keller .
get this processed and back to me right away .
did he leave a note ? .
did you read it ? .
of course you did .
would you read it to me , please ? .
dear silvia , i came to tell you something and then didn' t .
i wanted to , but when i saw you i couldn' t find the words .
i told you i didn' t know where simon is .
that was a lie .
he was there that day .
a young boy shot him .
i couldn' t tell you .
i' m a coward .
simon was braver than me .
you' re braver than me .
i' m so sorry .
i' m so sorry .
the second time was me .
i feel like my friends must feel when they try to say something .
it' s all right .
that' s what i say to them .
he left this with the note .
the only thing that i wanted ...
.. besides having her back ... was to be left alone .
my bonnie lies over the ocean
don' t cry .
don' t cry .
i' m not crying .
you don' t have to cry .
i' m not .
because i' m here , and i won ' t leave .
i promise .
look at me .
i' il take care of you .
we' il take care of each other .
i' il take care of you .
promise me .
i promise .
i promise .
xola' s dead .

desire diminishes .

just after we get off the bridge .
they decorated the bridge .
when i came here before , they lined the bridge with flowers , welcoming me .
that flight departs from gate one .
thank you .

the assembly will first hear an address by the president of the republic of matobo .
on behalf of the general assembly ,
i have the honour to welcome to the united nations
his excellency dr edmond zuwanie , president of the republic of matobo , and to invite him to address the assembly .
mr president , mr secretary general .
today my beloved country is under siege .
as you saw the other afternoon across the river in brooklyn , the terrorists in my country will stop at nothing .
how am i to defend my country against enemies like these ? .
i admit i have dealt harshly with terrorists ...
tobin , it' s king . .. as we all will have to .
i don' t think matu' s here .
remember the profile of suicide bombers and how there isn' t one ? . .. who know the evil and violence of real terrorism ...
your mother and sister will get their cheque on monday .
this isn' t his apartment .
you did well .
no one here will live long .
it' s an alds hospice . .. with a reciprocal and immediate violence ...
my opinion ? .
it' s a con .
i have been forced to do this .
it is the hope and specific goal of my administration
to reform these brutal methods ...
get him off the podium .
to participate in the formation ...
we' ve got to go .
but i want to speak !
come on , sir , run !
he' s ok .
cover here .
i' il take the hall .
where' s keller ? .
freeze !
incredible .
thank god i looked up .
he' s from our mission .
i know .
holster your weapon .
dr zuwanie .
i remember the last time you were here .
use the 42nd street exit .
we almost had an assassination here .
please move ...
we watched you on the telly back home .
my family .
all the families .
you were like the beatles .
two or three more seconds , he would have assassinated him .
an almost assassinated leader gets so much credibility so he can stay in power and gets to stick around to enjoy it .
we were so proud of you .
there you were , speaking to the world .
i don' t think you should touch ...
because i' m not wearing a glove ? .
what is your name , child ? .
i' m the silvia whose family you killed .
what' s in your hand ? .
it' s ...
just a precaution .
what' s in your hand ? .
he must' ve been very surprised .
he thought it was a live round .
where is everyone ? .
but you knew better .
give me the live round .
i grew up seeing you with this gun .
it' s the gun you saved our country with .
drop the gun !
put it down !
keller , us secret service .
it' s the same one you used to kill it .
he' s got a glock on his hip .
code 1 00 in the sound room .
look at it .
look at it !
careful .
the bleeder had alds .
there' s no way you can prove this .
you' il cop a plea .
you' re just an employee , right ? .
he' s in custody .
they' re bringing him down .
swat team' s at 42nd street .
are you all right ? .
yeah .
where' s zuwanie ? .
the safe room .
what happened ? .
it was a fake .
a piece of theatre to justify the killing .
ethnic cleansing , genocide .
you there ? .
that' s the flight .
she' s not on it .
i checked every hotel in new york , her friends .
they don' t know where she' d go .
no one knows her .
i know her .
ok , where is she ? .
she said she was going home .
i' m going home ...
what home ? .
how' d you happen to be there after hours ? .
an evacuation .
i left some things .
it takes too long ...
i wouldn ' t mind if he were gone .
she' s here .
she' s been in that room all night .
how could someone so good , so ...
how could you give us so much , so much ... then take away more ? .
he in there ? .
yeah .
keep everybody out .
silvia ? .
silvia ? .
it' s me .
i' m coming in alone .
i' m coming in .
five minutes .
close it .
close it !
silvia , don' t do this .
it was all just theatre , an almost assassination meant to justify his acts .
we' ve got all we need to prosecute .
i have him .
he' il die in prison .
i want him to die how simon died .
that' il be over in two seconds , and you' il have all your years .
sir , it' s a lot worse than you think .
your so called assassin is dead .
your head of security is making a deal .
we have lud and the rifle .
you' il be tried before two courts .
he' s been tried !
sir , you' re finished .
it doesn' t matter !
silvia .
listen to me .
i told you i' d let him drown .
the man who drove my wife into a bridge abutment .
but i wouldn' t .
then you' d be wrong .
no , i wouldn' t be wrong .
i don' t want to spend the rest of my life in mourning .
you have to get out of here .
i can' t do that .
so put the gun down .
i can' t .
yes , you can .
put it down .
i can' t !
i can' t ...
i can' t .
just go .
this is how it' s done .
this is how you put a gun down .
please .
you shoot him , he' il be dead ... .. but then you' il be dead ... .. and i don' t know what i' il be .
put it down .
read it !
read it .
where ? .
the beginning .
read it .
" the gunfire around us ...
louder .
like when you wrote it .
when you believed it .
when you meant it .
the gunfire around us makes it hard to hear .
but the human voice is different from other sounds .
" it can be heard ...
" it can be heard over ... over noises that bury everything else . " " even ...
" even ...
" even when it' s not shouting .
shouting . " " even when it ...
even if it' s just a whisper .
even the lowest whisper can be heard over armies ...
" when ...
" when ...
.. " when it' s telling the truth .

i wanted to say goodbye .
