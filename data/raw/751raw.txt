the flight leaves in four hours .
i wish we could set a wedding date without our parents actually having to meet .
honey , this weekend is gonna be fine .
and your parents are great .
oh , they' re great in small doses .
well , 48 hours in coconut grove is a small dose .
besides , you' ve already won over my dad , and that is the hard part .

um ...

that' s true .
you don' t need it .
get out of here .
the house of byrnes .
lot of good memories here .
mom ?
dad ?
i am watching you .
well , almost , but you have to do it with two fingers .
i am watching you .
we' il get back to that later .

yes .
nice to see you , grandpa .
my god .
how did my nephew get so big ?
look at you .
you look just like your mommy .
he does , doesn' t he ?
hey .
hey .
this is greg .
remember we talked about him ?
hey .
sorry , greg .
the card only comes in one gender .
oh !
yeah .
now , that' s that' s all right .
he' s taking you in .
he has a very keen sense for people , greg .
mmm .
he' s a chip off the old block , huh ?
we might have another cla man on our hands here .
i' d be discreet about my profession , greg , if i were you .
you know what i mean ?
as far as your parents are concerned , i' m still a horticulturist .
hey , why is little jack here ?
are deb and bob house sitting , while we' re in florida ?
no , they' re in ko saimii , thailand .
checking on the clinic they opened during their honeymoon .
what is all this stuff , anyway ?
after denny was sent away to military school , your father turned this into a learning laboratory for you know who over there .
and do you talk yet , mr. munchkinhead ?
greg , greg , greg .
don' t infantilize him .
talk to him like an adult .
muskrat .
huh ?
muskrat , jack .
all right .
just try to understand he' s a little person .
his communication skills aren' t verbal yet , but he understands .
observe .
l. j. , are you hungry ?
oh , wow .
look at that .
i would like to eat more please .
i' d like a nap , and then later i' il enjoy a nice poop .
oh , yeah .
i' ve heard about this , this baby signing stuff .
this is like cutting edge .
like ...
yeah .
well , at this age , greg , his mind is like a sponge .
look , when he reaches your age , for example , his mind will be far less capable of absorbing useful information .
so cute .
hey , can i hold him ?
oh , i i don' t think that' s such a good idea , greg .
muskrat .
uh ...
all right , all right .
this is greg .
greg will not drop you , okay ?
okay .
be careful .
hello .
oh !
hello .
hey .
i think he likes me .
no ?
ow !
oh , shit !
focker .
he' s absorbing you like a sponge .
i don' t want the first word out of his mouth to be a profanity .
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
cover your nose .
you' re terrifying him .
focker !
it' s cool that your dad is so into being a grandparent .
yeah , i guess so .
it kinda freaks my mom out .
she says he spends every last second with that kid .
oh , my god .
daddy ?
wow .
daddy , what is this thing ?
it' s a custom designed , climate controlled motor coach .
jack calls it the highlight of our twilight .
wow .
this is incredible .
isn' t it ?
yeah .
ooh !
like a tank .
well , in these uncertain times , greg ,
i opted for a kevlar reinforced hull with two inch thick plexiglas windows , just like the ones they design on the russian widowmaker submarines .
i want you to conduct a field test for us , greg .
i want you to demonstrate the impregnable outer skin of the coach .
throw it at the window .
oh .
jack , i' m not gonna
i' m not gonna throw a brick at your window .
it' s a simple demonstration .
no , i' d i' d really rather not .
throw the brick .
okay .
great .
just ...
all your might .
all right .
don' t worry , your rental insurance should take care of it .
you all right ?
what happened ?
come on , we' il call a tow truck from the road .
road ?
yeah .
we' re driving this to miami .
i thought we were i thought we were , we' re flying tomorrow .
no , no .
airline travel being what it is these days , so unreliable ,
i' il feel much more comfortable knowing i have my own posturepedic bed , my own thermostat , my own lavatory facility .
uh huh .
so so we' re all going to be in this together ?
we hit the road in exactly seven minutes , 27 seconds .
this way we' il get in early , spend an extra half day with your parents , getting to know them .
isn' t that great ?
that is great .
worth it for you but i' m the one that gets the fumes .
honey , i' m in the mood for a chimichanga .
so make a
hey , guys , uh , it' s me .
listen , i' m getting a little worried .
i haven' t heard back from you .
hope you got the message .
there' s been a little change of plans .
we' re gonna be , uh , coming down in jack' s rv now , so we' il be arriving tomorrow afternoon , not tomorrow night .
okay ?
tomorrow afternoon .
and , also , uh , they' re bringing their little grandson , so , uh , he' s like a baby .
so ...
i don' t know .
oh , welcome aboard , me hearties .
hey , this is incredible .
yes , it' s as big as our apartment .
pretty neat , huh ?
hey !
mr. jinx finally learned how to flush the toilet , huh ?
yeah .
jack installed a special flusher , and he learnt how to do that in about two days .
right , jack ?
hey there , jinxy .
how you doing ?
ready to hit the road , co captain ?
wow !
i' m the co captain ?
let' s set sail , sailor .
good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen .
this is captain jack byrnes speaking .
yeah , daddy !
a quick announcement .
as a courtesy to your fellow passengers , please remember that the onboard lavatory should be used for number one only .
should the need for number two arise , we' il stop at the nearest rest stop , gas station , or heavily wooded area .
thank you .
welcome aboard .
i like that thing .
hey , do you mind if i , uh , make a little announcement ?
well ...
only the captain gets to make an announcement .
you want to honk the horn ?
um ...
sure .
only the captain gets to honk the horn .
oh , look !
hey , jinxy , see that ?
you hungry ?
do you want some milk ?
hey !
jack ?
oh , she wants you to honk the horn .
not interested .
rules of the road .
she honks , you honk .
come on , jack .
come on .
give her a honk .
there you go .
it' s like a team or something .
honk if your are horny .
thanks for that , greg .
... for you but i' m the one that gets the fumes .
honey , i' m in the mood for a chimichanga .
so make a
hey , there .
no hard feelings , all right ?
friends ?
what' s that ?
what' re you saying ?
now , wait a minute .
what does this mean ?
i know what this means .
squeeze , squeeze , squeeze .
oh , poop !
you got to poop , right ?
okay , good .
thank you for warning me .
everybody poops .
sometimes it hurts .
it' s okay .
just let it come out .
what did you do , focker ?
nothing .
he ...
i think he has to poop .
that' s not the sign for poop .
that' s the sign for milk .
this is the sign for poop .
oh !
what' s the sign for sour milk ?
' cause , uh this tastes a little funky .
that' s because it' s from debbie' s left breast , greg .
fortunately , she pumped for a week to give us enough for the trip .
okay , snack pack for little jack .
what are you doing there ?
well , during the breastfeeding stage , greg , infants can get very confused and upset when they' re separated from their mothers .
so i invented something to ease l. j. ' s anxiety during chow time .
i call it the mannary gland .
i had it made from an exact cast of debbie' s left bosom .
oh , yeah .
okay .
it' s been so effective ,
i' m thinking of getting it patented .
would you like to touch it ?
uh , i wouldn' t .
oh , come on , feel how soft it is .
i can i can see how soft it is from here .
no , feel it , greg .
it' s very it looks very
just feel the breast , greg .
just a ...
oh , watch the nipple .
just around here .
nipple is his .
oh , yeah .
yeah .
it' s got a great , lifelike , and a ...
or what i would imagine
debbie' s breast might might actually feel like .
not that i would know .
greg .
what ?
honey , you promised you wouldn' t take the boob out in front of company .
it' s nothing to be ashamed of .
breast feeding is perfectly natural .
dad , that' s not natural , that' s just weird .
as soon as little jack' s topped off , we' re gonna hit the road .
oh !
oh , jack , you can' t drive any more tonight .
dr. monroe said no aggravating your sciatica .
honey , we' re on a very precise schedule .
we bunk here tonight , we hit horrendous traffic in the morning .
greg ?
yeah .
maybe you could drive the night shift .
i could do that .
i am the co captain .
so , i think that falls under my responsibilities , right ?
yeah .
keep her at 55 , stay alert .
yeah , yeah .
i' ve been wanting to get behind the wheel of this big boy .
you got it .
pass .
sorry , got to go 55 .
captain jack' s orders .
hmm .
hey !
would you like some company , greg ?
uh , yeah , sure .
if you can' t sleep .
go on .
have a seat .
how about a cappuccino ?
oh , you don' t have to do that .
it' s no problem for me .
really ?
yeah ?
okay .
dina !
wake up and make greg a cappuccino !
shake a leg , woman !
jesus , jack , you know , i' m not that tired .
really .
relax , greg .
this cockpit' s completely soundproofed .
you should' ve seen the look on your face .
okay , okay .
you got me .
that was that was a good one .
yes , it was .
yes .
mmm hmm .
it' s funny .
but you should never talk to a woman like that , you know that , greg .
it' s disrespectful .
right , of course .
yeah .
greg , a man reaches a certain age when he realizes what' s truly important .
hmm mmm .
you know what that is ?
love ?
friendship ?
enjoying the moment .
living .
just love .
his legacy .
that , too .
right .
yeah .
sure .
now , my grandson , little jack , is part of that legacy .
in six months , you and pam are gonna be married .
sometime after that , you' il want to start a family of your own .
yeah .
right .
actually , on the subject ,
i had some thoughts about the wedding date .
we' il discuss that later , after this weekend , greg .
now , let' s get back on point .
let me put it very simply .
if your family circle does indeed join my family circle , they' il form a chain .
i can' t have a chink in my chain .
hmm .
yeah .
okay .
i get the metaphor .
now , i' ve never met your parents , so i' m not going to jump to any hasty conclusions .
but , like studying a frozen caveman , if i can see where you came from ,
i' il have a much better idea of where you' re going .
okay .
a are you thinking maybe my parents might be
like like a chink in the chain or ...
a doctor and a lawyer , what' s there to worry about ?
mmm hmm .
ooh , it seems very nice .
is that your father ?
that is my father .
hey !
there you are .
what the heck is that contraption ?
i thought you guys were flying in tonight .
i left a message yesterday we were driving
oh , i didn' t get a message .
i left you like five messages .
will you get over here and plant one on me .
talking about messages .
i' ve been waiting so long to see you .
my best buddy .
good to see you .
come here .
come here .
oh , i missed you .
is this not the most handsome young man you' ve ever seen in your life ?
i used to call him a young jewish marlon brando .
huh ?
can you believe
i conceived him with one testicle ?
no , really .
it' s true .
i only have one because the other never dropped .
it' s called an undescending testicle .
it' s not uncommon , but look at him .
imagine what he would have looked like if i had two .
that' s a good icebreaker .
whoa !
ho !
there' s the sexiest second grade teacher
i' ve ever seen in my life .
that was a good one .
it gets her every time .
goose bumps .
she loves it .
i' m dina byrnes .
it' s so nice to meet you .
the pleasure is all mine , mon cheri .
you got to be the flower man .
that' s right .
jack byrnes , pam' s father .
and i' m bernard focker , gaylord' s father , and we' re all grownups here and we shake hands like men .
all right .
oh , we' re just playing here .
give me some love .
we' re family now .
what' re you so shy about ?
come here .
oh , wow .
look at those pecs .
wow !
you' re harder than sheetrock .
now tell me the truth .
you work out with weights , right ?
well , i do various callisthenics .
some medicine ball training , i play bimonthly football .
oh , footie footie football ?
i was just , uh , practicing my capoeira .
what ?
oh , capoeira .
yeah .
the brazilian martial art of dance fighting .
yes .
he knows what that is .
yeah .
you know , i' ve been doing it for weeks .
i' m really into it .
it keeps me level .
because sometimes i get wound up so tight ,
i could just snap .
you know what i mean ?
what is that ?
what is that ?
is there a baby on board ?
that' s a baby .
yes , yes .
yeah .
hmm mmm .
it was all in the message .
hey , moses , go ahead , say hello to your future in laws .
no , no , he' s harmless .
and yeah , fixed .
moses .
that' s all right .
just shake him off .
oh , no .
don' t shake .
he likes the shaking .
moses , get off !
no , don' t worry .
the pink part didn' t get on you .
moses , go , get in your basket .
go !
he' s all talk .
who' s this little guy ?
this is our grandson , little jack .
oh , little baby .
how are you , little jack ?
hey , dad , don' t don' t don' t infantilize him .
just talk to him like a person .
what are you talking about ?
he' s a baby .
i want to talk to him like he' s a baby .
bazooka !
bazooka !
he likes me .
hey , we' re freezing our tushies off here in detroit .
you know , " let' s head south and get some year round fun in the sun .
this house is over a 100 years old , so
dad .
dad , you continue the tour .
i' m gonna tell mom we' re here , okay ?
oh !
the upstairs bathroom is on el fritzo .
so we' re all gonna have to share this one for now .
since there' s a water scarcity on the island , we kind of abide by the " if it' s yellow let it mellow , if it' s brown flush it down " policy .
oops .
forgot my own rule .
the rv has paid for itself already .
all right , kids .
forward and backward .
rotate those hips .
let' s get your kundalini rising .
and now it' s time for the ladies to get into the reverse cowgirl position .
guys , you have to lie across the liberator pad
like so .
everyone look at how ira' s doing it .
bingo .
bango .
bungo .
the man is loose , he' s limber and he' s ready for action .
so , climb aboard , girls , and let me hear your bodies talk .
ooh !
whoa !
yes !
this position is terrific for anyone with osteoporosis , gout or goiter .
stay with me , kids .
we' re almost done .
ah !
honey !
oh !
all right , guys .
we have to wrap it up .
everyone .
remember to take your liberator pads .
and don' t forget to stretch before you try this at home .
we don' t want anyone shattering a pelvis .
hello , my precious .
oh , i love you so much .
i haven' t seen my bubeleh in months .
honey , you feel thin .
no , no .
you' re not eating .
what' s the matter ?
no .
i' m fine .
mom , how do we explain all these people to the byrneses ?
honey , they' re leaving .
the byrneses won' t know they were here .
okay .
we agreed to be discreet about you being a sex therapist this weekend until you got to know jack and dina better .
right ?
don' t worry .
i' il be discreet .
i put all my toys away .
and my office is all ready for them to sleep in .
your office ?
no , no . we' re putting them upstairs .
your father thought they' d be more comfortable down here .
the upstairs plumbing ...
you don' t wanna know .
talk to me about something important , honey .
how are things with you and pam ?
they' re great .
because , you know , after two years , you have to work to keep things going .
does she still climax regularly ?
mom .
you can' t talk that way this weekend , okay ?
honey , i' m just saying
i didn' t raise you to be a so so lover .
i know .
okay , what is he doing ?
what ?
don' t don' t worry about them .
mom , mom , you got to get these people out of here now .
okay .
wipe that little gloss off you .
okay .
you hunt deer , bernard ?
what ?
no , i hate that thing .
roz' s father gave it to us .
he was into all that macho wacho crap .
oh !
so is greg .
he and i went duck hunting together .
didn' t we , greg ?
hmm ?
duck hunting ?
me and you ?
duck hunting ?
yeah .
mmm hmm .
what ?
what ?
gay , you went duck hunting with with jack ?
um , yeah .
we went , we did .
we went on a little hunting trip .
you shot a duck ?
i shot at a duck and ...
mmm hmm .
you killed an innocent creature of the sky ?
i don' t ...
did i ...
i did ...
i don' t ...
i think i might' ve clipped it or ...
never really checked .
oh , lord .
and now , for the piece de resistance .
oh , my goodness .
little somethin ' i' ve been workin ' on .
oh , i see .
oh .
mom will be out in a sec .
what' s that ?
it' s you .
it' s the wall of gaylord .
the wall of gaylord ?
isn' t it nice to finally display your accomplishments , son ?
honey , look at all your awards .
that' s great .
he' s my champion .
oh , i didn' t know they made ninth place ribbons .
oh , jack , they got them all the way up to 10th place .
hey !
anybody want to get a drink by the lagoon ?
this one looks impressive .
mazel tov , gaylord m. focker .
world s greatest nurse .
very nice .
we' ve always tried to instill a sense of self in gaylord without being too goal oriented .
it' s not about winning or losing , it' s about passion .
we just want him to love what he' s doin ' .
you know what i mean , jack ?
not really , bernard .
i think a competitive drive is the essential key that makes america the only remaining superpower in the world today .
well , whatever works .
mmm hmm .
all right .
don' t forget the positions .
bye , dr. roz .
you' re a lifesaver .
oh , thank you , bj .
goodbye .
ira , remember , easy on the thrusting .
you' re not 78 anymore .
bing , bang , bong .
what what kind of work does your mother do with those patients ?
those look like yoga mats .
is there yoga involved ?
it' s yogaesque .
it' s sort of , um , a , um , a a a couples therapy .
kind of mind body ...
it' s kind of her own sort of
rozela !
sweetheart , living room !
hello !
hello !
hello !
how are you , baby girl ?
good , roz .
god !
look at you , you' re glowing !
oh , thank you .
hi , i' m roz focker you must be jack , and you must be dina .
hi .
i i just can' t believe it' s taken us this long to meet , huh .
and who' s this little hairball ?
they brought their grandson baby jack along .
he' s so adorable .
i could eat him up .
bern , did you show them where they' re sleeping ?
right , right , right .
because we don' t have any air conditioning ,
i made up a nice spot for you in roz' s office ' cause it gets the best breeze , and it' s very near the communal commode .
oh , well , you know , actually , we' re gonna stay in our motor home .
in the trailer ?
come on , jack .
you' re family .
we sleep under the same roof .
actually , mom' s office is kind of cluttered .
so , that that works all right .
it' s just really easier with little jack .
no , no .
really .
we insist .
they wanna sleep in the trailer ,
let them sleep in the trailer .
mom , it' s not actually it' s not a trailer .
it' s kind of like it' s like a like a hotel on wheels .
this is practically a hotel .
i was gonna do the turndown service
i know , i know , but it' s their choice .
wherever you feel most comfortable is fine .
it' s not right .
bern , let it go .
let it go ?
fine .
yeah , let it go .
look at you , sulking .
now , look at this .
i married a teenager .
right ?
at least you have the libido of a teenager .
i gave her a little matinee today
oh !
don' t you dare !
stop it !
how about a double feature ?
come on .
come on .
lagoon ?
why don' t we go show them the lagoon ?
the lagoon .
come see the lagoon .
the lagoon , jack .
come on .
we' il get drunk , we' il take a piss in the lagoon .
roz , why don' t you take them outside ?
show them around .
i' il make a drink .
oh , god .
hey , dad
it' s going good so far , right ?
dad , you gotta take down that weird shrine thing .
but i' m very proud of you , gaylord .
what' s wrong with showing it ?
it' s ridiculous .
most people aren' t proud of sixth place ribbons .
most people ?
since when do you care about most people ?
i don' t , but jack is really into winning and competition and sports .
it' s a whole other thing with him .
hey .
hey .
you' re a winner up here and in here .
and that' s all that matters .
okay .
thank you .
i don' t know what that means , but thank you .
so , to solve that problem ,
i created a life like latex left breast moulded from his mother' s actual left breast , so this way l. j. would avoid any nipple confusion .
you' re avoiding confusion by strapping a boob on a man ?
well , yes , believe it or not , it is less confusing because of the texture
mom . ... of the breast itself .
uh , i guess it' s very , uh , creative .
it' s very creative .
a little birdie told me that one of our guests here is a tom collins man .
oh , for pity' s sake .
isn' t that nice , jack ?
that is nice .
thank you .
all right .
wait .
don' t drink .
i want to make a toast .
now , i had a vasectomy in 1974 ...
' 73 , honey .
you' re right .
' 73 .
so , unfortunately , i never had the chance to procreate a daughter , but had i been able to ,
i really would' ve wanted a girl as sensitive and as intelligent and as beautiful as this young lady sitting right here before us .
thank you , bernie .
and if i might add ...
greg .
yeah .
i thought you had a sister ?
nope .
no sister .
you said you had a sister .
you said you milked your sister' s cat .
okay , i' m not done yet .
what i' m trying to say is , it' s taken far too long to do this , you know , but we' re finally all together .
that' s nice , honey .
oh , thank you .
all right , that' s enough .
l' chaim , everyone .
l' chaim !
l' ha ha .

to family .
oh !
i forgot .
i want to say one more thing about my vasectomy .
sit down .
honey , get yourself over here .
i went overboard ?
a little bit .
you' re so cute , they' il forgive you anything .
god !
you' re so beautiful .
you are the sexiest woman alive i know .
mmm .
you' re just trying to get me back into bed .
or the hammock .
this is a delicious tom collins .
what i did , i used real lemon juice .
it' s from our trees here .
that' s the secret .
he was squeezing all afternoon .
yeah .
and , jack ,
i managed to make some lemon juice , too .
gay , you all right ?
honey , you okay ?
are you sure ?
well , i think that roz and bernie seem like very nice people .
oh !
very nice people .
a little off colour , but very nice .
oh !
but isn' t it wonderful , jack ?
after all this build up , the kids are finally getting married .
i feel so happy .
wait a second .
i think he just spoke .
little jack , were you about to speak ?
nope , just a little flatulence .
what were you saying , honey ?
nothing , dear .
guys , where are you going ?
we' re checking out jack' s macho wacho trailer .
yeah .
i want to see that boob .
can i talk to you for a sec ?
yeah .
hey , listen , don' t let moses go in there .
they have a cat .
moses is perfectly trained
dad , he humps everything that moves .
honey , he' s like his father .
i never cheated on you .
they' re not listening to me .
so , what' s up ?
they seem to be getting along really well , don' t you think ?
yeah , they do .
i know .
i kind of feel bad that i worried so much .
yeah .
that was okay .
what' s going on ?
i' m pregnant .
you' re pregnant ?
mmm hmm .
i' m two weeks late .
i' m nauseous , my boobs hurt , and i can smell everything .
you' re gonna have a baby .
yeah .
a baby .
oh , we' re gonna have a little baby , a baby .
i' m pregnant .
i just i ...
yeah .
oh , shit !
you realize your father is going to kill me ?
no , no , no , no , no .
he' s not gonna find out because we' re not going to tell him .
no , no , no , no , no .
come on .
he' s a human lie detector .
he lives to sniff out stuff like this .
we' il get through this weekend , we' il get through tomorrow .
and and and we' il tell them on sunday before we go .
okay ?
we' il tell them all .
i just hate the idea of keeping secrets from your dad .
it' s just one little secret .
oh !
hi , neighbours .
hello .
the fockers , honey .
a la fancy shmancy .
welcome to the chateau .
no wonder they don' t want to sleep in our shit box .
look at this place .
i i don' t think the dog is such a good idea .
don' t worry .
moses is more of a lover than a fighter .
jesus !
moses !
he' s always dreamt of me having a white wedding .
you don' t know how upset he' s gonna be .
no , i do know .
moses !
moses !
jinxy !
dad , i told you to keep him out of the rv .
he said he wanted to see the rv .
dad !
moses !
moses !
get that goddamn dog out of here !
mo !
oh , god !
dad !
oh !
jinx .
jinx , don' t do it .
jinxy , no .
don' t do it !
no !
jesus !
moses !
hold on .
moses , hold on .
i' m gonna save you !
the cat can flush ?
oh , my god !
get out of the way !
hey !
what the hell are you doing ?
that' s my toilet !
i got to get my dog !
forget your dog .
what about my toilet ?
moses !
no !
stop the baby !
stop the baby !
he' s alive !
he' s fine .
so much for the protection of our rolling safe house .
oh , honey , he was trying to save his pet .
i mean , what if it was jinxy who got flushed into a toilet ?
mr. jinx has had extensive aquatic training .
he would have known exactly what to do in the event of a submersion .
20 minute warning for dinner , guys .
sorry about the trailer , jack .
muskrat .
it' s okay , bernard .
there' s no way we' re not telling him this weekend .
i know .
that' s what i was saying .
so , what do you wanna do ?
i' m not sure .
i never thought this' d be an issue .
i thought we' d be married before we got pregnant .
hey .
what ?
why don' t we move the wedding up to next month ?
what ?
then we' il tell your dad you got pregnant on the honeymoon .
oh , my god , yeah , that could work .
yeah .
it' s perfect , right ?
yeah .
okay .
good .
just follow my lead .
okay .
okay .
without further ado , my famous focker fondue .
come on , dig in .
come on .
get it while it' s hot .
that is so impressive , bernie .
did you do that yourself ?
oh , sure .
oh !
i love to cook .
i can' t even fry an egg .
true .
i burn cornflakes .
i' m amazed he finds the time to cook with such a high powered legal career .
high powered ?
i wouldn' t exactly call uh oh !
you kicked me .
why did you kick me ?
i kick kicked you because you' re being modest and you should tell people that you are a good lawyer , which he is , a a and he has fought some really big , important legal battles .
truth is , jack , when gay was born , i stopped practicing and became a stay at home dad .
oh , believe me , he won a trial or two in his day .
oh !
extremely good trial lawyer .
a regular clarence darrow .
so roz was the primary breadwinner and you didn' t have a job ?
dad .
honey , come on , you could say he had the hardest job .
oh , he' s he' s just kidding .
of course , i' m ...
yes .
why don' t we jump into the topic of the hour , hmm , the big focker byrnes wedding .
yes .
good .
i know we' ve been talking about a a fall wedding ...
is that isabel ?
oh , yeah .
our former housekeeper , isabel .
you know , she has her own catering business now , isn' t that great ?
and and i asked her to come and help bernie in the kitchen this weekend .
you didn' t tell me she was here .
gay had a monster crush on her when he was a teenager .
really ?
i didn' t have any monster crush .
you didn' t tell me about that .
yeah .
because it' s not true .
oh , not true ?
then i didn' t catch you doing baziga to her passport photo when you were , what , 13 ?
honey , stop .
i walk in the door ...
where is he ?
oh , there' s my baby !
hey !
good to see you .
mmm .
good to see you .
i i haven' t seen you in years .
i know .
mmm .
yes , you ...
wow !
yeah .
look at you .
you look ...
i know .
yeah .
you look ...
i had a boob job .
wow .
yeah .
yeah .
hey !
this is , uh , dina and jack byrnes .
mucho gusto .
hi , isabel .
mucho gusto .
and this is pam byrnes , my fiance .
encantada .
nice to meet you , too .
not yet married , and already a little one ?
and he is a handsome little focker .
see ?
oh , no .
he' s not a focker .
yeah , no .
he' s not mine .
and still you stayed to raise her child ?
good for you .
no , he' s pam' s nephew .
he has no connection to greg whatsoever .
i love you , too .
mama !
mama !
mama !
little jack , no .
those aren' t for you .
mom .
i think i' il take him inside .
good idea .
you' re a very lucky woman , pam .
he' s very special , this one .
i think so , too .
oh , i could tell you some stories about him .
really ?
oh , she' s just being silly .
nice to meet you all .
nice to meet you .
so sweet .
oh !
so sweet .
hey , do you guys want some more , uh , wine ?
mas vino por la mama , si .
hey .
hey , you did good , greg .
she' s very pretty , this one , huh ?
yeah , she' s , uh , she' s really great .
really great .
can you believe it' s been 15 years ?
so many wonderful memories from those days .
yes .
yes , lot of wonderful , kind of private memories .
so , you never told your fiance about us , huh ?
um , no , i don' t think i did .
i don' t , i think , i don' t think it ever came up on my end .
not that i didn' t want her to know .
it just , never really ...
yeah , and not that , i i mean , not that it wasn' t great .
it was really , you know , for me it was like ...
and you were so helpful and and
don' t you worry , baby .
your secret' s safe with me .
okay .
there' s no secrets .
but , good , yeah , maybe if we keep it quiet this weekend and then ...
because , yeah , i don' t want pam to feel uncomfortable .
and then later , when it' s the proper , you know , setting , i can ...
okay , yeah , okay , good .
and , uh ...
good .
oh , and fondue , fondue is going is goin ' over .
gay , you' re just in time to hear me tell the gang how you lost your virginity to isabel .
he was 19 .
a late bloomer .
you s slept with isabel ?
we were relieved .
why why would you , why why would you bring that up ?
what' s the problem ?
it was , what , 15 years ago .
honey , your father thought that it' d be fun to share stories about our first time .
really ?
that sounds like fun .
that' s ...
that' s fine .
come on , tell us how you popped your cherry .
come on .
i really don' t feel comfortable discussing that with you , bernard .
you know what ?
i suggest that we get back to talking about the wedding .
thank you , bernie .
what ?
mom , didn' t you just take little jack back to the room ?
i' m monitoring him from a high powered multidirectional microphone planted in his crib .
oh , baby monitors .
hidden cameras .
whatever happened to a little thing called privacy ?
bernie , surveillance technology has helped protect a lot of the freedoms that we as americans take advantage of today .
he' s right .
it has been good .
s son , that is bullcrap in a chef' s salad .
jack , tell me one smart thing the clla has done and i' il give you the deed to her house .
the clla ?
the central lack of intelligence agency .
i think that baby might need a couple of pulls on that knocker of yours , jack .
no , it' s okay .
we' re ferberizing him .
you' re what ?
the ferber method .
you let him cry it out .
this way he doesn' t depend on coddling .
on the other hand , the continuum concept shows that a baby benefits more from constant physical contact .
oh .
we use the ferber method .
we used the focker method .
we hugged and kissed that little prince
like there was no tomorrow .
we fockerized him .
that' s right .
greggy practically slept in our bed till he was 10 .
oh , my god !
oh , i don' t think it was quite that long .
yes , it was .
no , it wasn' t 10 .
nine and a half , at least .
mom , i don' t think so .
i didn' t sleep in their bed all that time .
bernie , get the photo album .
i' m one step ahead of you .
no , no , no , we' re eating dinner , come on .
these are the curls from his first trip to the barbershop .
nobody wants to see this .
oh , and you kept all of his baby teeth .
look at his darling little teeth , isn' t that sweet ?
uh oh , somebody looks very grumpy there .
oh , that' s gay with the mohel .
the mohel ?
no .
he' s the man who snips the baby' s little winkydink .
see , that' s greg getting circumcised , right here .
we had the ceremony at my parents ' house but there was a cold snap and ...
tell him .
the heater conked out .
mom .
no matter how hard he tried , the mohel couldn' t coax
greg' s tiny little turtle from its shell .
you know what ?
let' s not talk about the tiny turtle , okay ?
let' s ...
th this is dinner .
honey , half the people at this table have penises .
mom , control yourself .
roz , he' s right .
you' re embarrassing him .
okay , i' m sorry .
make a long story short , jack , he wound up with a semicirc .
what' s a semicirc ?
i can' t wait to hear this .
what ?
it' s a cross between an ant eater and
a german army helmet .
but , honey ...
oh !
you wanted to talk about the wedding , right ?
don' t tell me you kept his umbilical cord .
of course not , that' s greg' s foreskin .
all right , you know what ?
that' s it .
that' s that' s enough humiliation .
honey , stop .
we' re having fun .
no , i' m not having fun .
why deny us our memories ?
because we' re done !
anyone in the mood for chinese ?
you told me your first time was with the danish transfer student in high school .
yeah , well , you weren' t exactly forthcoming about your engagement with kevin .
yeah , well , he wasn' t my babysitter .
okay , i should have told you , all right .
can we just let it go , please ?
we both got enough stuff to deal with this weekend .
oh , hi , jack .
hello , greg .
funny dinner , huh ?
how do you mean ?
i know that you are studying my family like the frozen caveman .
so , i just , i don' t want you to be worried , okay ?
i mean , they' re a little quirky , but they they' re well intentioned and and i think they' re just nervous and ...
greg , i am sure tomorrow will be a better day .
i' m sorry , ma' am .
i thought you ordered room service .
are you sure you don' t want any whipped cream with your sundae ?
bern , stop it !
who' s bern ?
i' m chad , the bellhop .
oh , no , come on , we did that last week .
can' t you be sam the carpet cleaning man ?
it' s illogical .
why would a carpet cleaner have whipped cream ?
well , improvise , honey .
good evening , miss .
i' m here to clean your carpet .
do you mind if i put some foam down on your rug ?
i don' t mind at all .
good night , greg .
okay , sleep well , jack .
how long how long have you worked in this hotel ?
it' s time to put some snow on your mountains .
come on , i' m gonna get some whipped cream on those tetons .
guys !
come back in the morning , tootsie roll .
gay , you see the cowboy hat on the door ?
cowboy hat is off the door !
no cowboy hat this weekend !
i' m coming in !
just stop doing what you' re doing !
oh !
come on , man , you know what that cowboy hat on the door means .
will you please help me out here ?
what ?
we' re just being ourselves .
mom , mom , please ...
i think he' s saying not to be ourselves .
yes , be yourselves but be yourself in a way that' s a little less than being your full selves , okay .
i don' t understand this .
i mean , why you' re so afraid of this jack ?
you' ve been kissing his ass ever since you got here .
mom , i' m not afraid of him , okay .
it' s not true .
it is true .
i can' t believe you went duck hunting with him .
our people don' t shoot ducks .
just make jack feel a little more comfortable here , okay ?
so you don' t want us to be ourselves ?
no , i just don' t want you to break his rv , dad , and and and reveal that i had sex with isabel and play weird sex games that everybody can hear in the house .
mom ...
mom , please .
if you ask me , it wouldn' t be so bad if your future in laws heard this .
do me a favour .
just don' t therapize the byrneses this weekend at all , okay ?
all i' m saying is , a few minutes of concentrated work with him and dina , she could get him to blow like krakatoa .
right , okay , yeah , you know what ?
one day , just give me one day , okay , without any complications .
we get through it , everybody goes off , we go on with our lives .
can we do that ?
all right .
you got it , dude .
thank you , okay .
hon , put the hat back on the door , okay ?
no mom .
no cowboy hat this weekend .
okay , but tonight doesn' t count .
all aboard .
morning , partner .
morning .
sleep okay ?
i slept all right , thank you .
it' s nice , all of us being here together , don' t you think ?
bernard , do you mind if i have some privacy ?
almost done .
bernie , this fritatta is wonderful .
what' s in it ?
well , a lot of the taste comes from this old skillet .
i' ve never washed it .
hey , guys , can i have everybody' s attention , please ?
gay , be back in a second .
okay , dad .
all right .
uh , so ...
mom , i know we' ve been we' ve been talking about having the , uh , wedding in october , but pam and i have been doing a little thinkin ' and playing around with some ideas and , uh , we' re thinking of moving it up to june .
nice .
this june ?
yeah .
yeah .
that' s that' s in a month .
i always wanted a spring wedding , you know .
well , that' s great , so we can announce it at the party tonight .
good idea .
wait , what party ?
jack !
let' s play football !
oh , your father and i are throwing a little engagement soiree for you two lovebirds .
look at that .
that' s so sweet .
thank you , guys .
i thought we were just having a nice quiet dinner .
it was supposed to be a surprise .
the phone keeps ringing , the list keeps growing .
yeah , now , it' s up to 50 fockers .
when were you going to tell us about this ?
50 fockers .
what could be better ?
dad , what are you doing ?
we never play football .
i' m trying to cement relationships here .
jack said he was into footy ball .
let' s show ei stiffo how we play the game .
footy ball ?
come on , come on , let' s play !
i' m feeling a little tired .
i think i' il sit it out with little jack , okay ?
honey , you want me to keep you company ?
no , dina , come on , you and i will take on jack and roz .
come on , jack , it' il be fun , we' il swap wives .
don' t worry , you' il get her back after the game .
fine , we' il play three on two .
but someone needs to be official quarterback .
gay goes both ways .
i' il bet he does .
one , two .
hut .
come on .
i' il run a down and in , draw in the defence , then you' il hit roz here in the end zone for a td .
what do you mean ?
he hits me where with a what ?
i' il throw you the ball , you try to catch it , okay .
you want me to catch ?
yeah .
on two .
ready ?
yes .
hut one , hut two , hike !
come on , this way !
that way , that way , that way .
you remember that time in the park ?
you remember that time in the park ?
guys , come on , come on , cut it out .
i' m so proud of you .
i caught the ball .
mom , come on .
i caught the ball !
come on , huddle up .
no , i' m bored .
here !
dina , come on , let' s go .
you want a spritzer ?
what ?
oh , a spritzer .
that sounds yummy .
all right , come on .
dad , you got to focus , all right ?
he' s beating you down the field every time .
you want me to be macho wacho ?
no .
what ?
have i ever said the words macho wacho to you in my life ?
i got it .
what ?
i won' t disappoint you .
okay , let' s try again , i' m gonna run a stop and go .
fake the short pass , then hit me here in the end zone with a hail mary .
okay , got that .
yeah , we keep running that play .
you want to mix it up a little ?
no , i don' t .
i' ve exposed bernie' s weakness and i want to take advantage of it .
exposed his weakness .
okay , okay .
on four ?
four .
just you and me , jack .
mano a mano .
you think you can take me , flowerman ?
i' m pretty sure i can , mr. mom .
you' re going down , bernsie boy .
i' m going to rearrange your bouquet .
sell the pump fake , greg ,
' cause that focker' s gonna bite .
hut one , hut two , hut three , hut four .
hike !
oh , my god !
are you all right ?
shit !
hey , jack , you okay ?
i' m fine , greg , thank you .
i see that kind of injury all the time at the hospital .
i wish you' d let me give you a quick exam .
no , i' m , i' m fine .
i told you i' il have my doctor look at it when i get home .
okay .
you know , it' s amazing how your father anticipated the pump fake like that .
it' s almost like he knew it was coming .
hmm .
well , he definitely takes competition seriously .
how a man handles himself on the football field says a lot about his character .
know what i mean ?
okay .
hey .
hey .
we got him , didn' t we , dude , huh ?
was he impressed ?
no , dad , he wasn' t .
that was a really hard shot .
you could' ve hurt him .
i just wanted it to be a fun game but you wanted to win , so , you know , you got me all steamed up .
no , i asked you to play a little defence ,
i didn' t ask you to turn it into a blood sport .
i play too easy .
i play too hard .
what are you really asking me to do , gaylord ?
i' m not asking anything of you , dad .
just just go down there and apologize to him , okay ?
he thinks it was a cheap shot .
sure .
okay .
whatever you say .
okay .
i can' t win with this kid .
honey  i can' t .
it' s okay .
hi , baby .
hey .
so , how far along is pam ?
hmm ?
what ?
come on , honey , i knew it the minute i saw her .
her boobs are bigger .
she' s hormonal .
no wine at dinner , no football .
she just found out yesterday .
honey .
my bubeleh' s going to have a baby !
my bubeleh' s going to be a father !
oh , my god .
tell me , talk to me , so this is so exciting .
no .
you didn' t tell dad , did you ?
no , not yet .
he' s gonna plotz .
no , no , mom , you can' t tell him .
why not ?
because he can' t keep a secret .
you know that .
you think jack knows ?
are you kidding ?
that guy' s in such denial , he still thinks his daughter is still a virgin .
yeah , i know , he' s very old fashioned .
that' s why pam can' t tell him till after the wedding .
that is ridiculous .
mom , it isn' t , believe me .
you don' t know him like i do .
fine .
my lips are sealed .
i am so excited and thrilled for you .
so happy for you two !
did you plan this ?
uh , no , it just sort of happened .
how did it happen ?
how ?
it just happened .
you know you know how it happens .
i mean , i' m not going into the details .
honey , i love details .
sorry .
all right .
okay .
well , you know , honey , many unplanned pregnancies happen because the man is such a sexual dynamo and the woman craves his sperm on an unconscious but very powerful level .
hmm mmm .
mom , i am truly not comfortable having this conversation with you .
no ?
no .
i' ve been saying it since i was 11 .
all right .
love you .
love you , too .
uh , jack !
what say you and me go into town ?
i got a guy who can fix your rv .
i' m in far too much physical agony , bernie .
gee , i' m sorry , but it' il be good for you , you know , to , you know , to get out and about .
yeah .
perfect .
i can take the girls shopping in coconut grove .
little jack is on a very specific napping schedule .
i better stay here .
no , go .
greg can watch him .
yeah , sure .
he has wonderful parental instincts .
dad , greg deals with little kids in the er all the time .
it' s true .
they don' t call me barry poppins for nothing .
that' s so cute .
why would someone call you barry poppins ?
they wouldn' t .
now , remember , greg , we' re ferberizing him .
so unless it' s an emergency , under no circumstances should you pick him up or coddle him in any way when he cries .
hmm mmm .
okay .
he' s learning to self soothe , that means no television , no unapproved toys , and most of all , no monkey business of any kind .
is that clear ?
mmm hmm .
no monkey business .
okay .
jack .
shall we get a move on , pal o mino ?
i' m ready .
i love this , roz .
this is a great find .
oh , good , and it' s loose , so you can wear it even if you gain a few pounds .
isn' t that lovely ?
honey , are you all right ?
you look a little flushed .
oh , it' s just the heat .
it takes some getting used to .
i' m fine .
i' m going to try this on .
thank you , roz .
now , madame ,
let' s find something sexy for the momma to wear .
look at this little number .
whoa !
i think this will get jack' s blood flowing .
jack would have a coronary .
i thought so .
oh , dina , talk to me .
what' s really going on with that man ?
he seems very uptight .
jack' s always been a little wound up .
his job was very stressful .
being a florist is stressful ?
there' s more to it than people think .
mmm hmm .
if you don' t mind me asking , how is your sex life ?
i can' t tell you that .
what' s the big deal ?
i' m a professional .
dina , i' m a sex therapist , specializing in senior sexuality .
i knew those weren' t yoga mats .
we' re not 25 any anymore .
but you' re not dead , either .
lots of couples our age
lack intimacy in their marriages .
i didn' t say we weren' t intimate .
there are special occasions .
you know , anniversaries and ...
well , on our anniversary .
ay ya yay .
nicht gut .
i beg your pardon .
not good .
i think that i can help you and jack reconnect .
how ?
well , it all starts with a little bit of , uh , how shall i say , intimate contact .
yeah .
mmm hmm .
my , that tingles .
every pleasure in the body can be stimulated through the ears .
i' d give it a shot with jack tonight .
what' s goin ' on over here ?
nothing , just having some girl talk .
roz .
okay .
here' s the deal , l. j ..
i' m going to give you a few minutes of attention .
but you have to promise that you don' t tell grandpa jack anything , okay ?
all right .
good .
okay , i don' t quite know what that means , but i' m going to trust you .
all right .
here we go .
okay .
okay .
it' s okay .
a little huggie wuggie never hurt anybody .
i know we aren' t supposed to watch tv but we won' t tell grandpa jack , will we ?
oh , look , look , it' s elmo .
do you like fishes ?
you don' t like fishes ?
no .
all right .
okay .
okay .
hey , i got an idea .
let' s see what pre approved genius toys grandpa jack has in his big basket of fun .
mmm ?
oh , look , look , it' s a it' s a an abacus .

jorge , what did i tell you ?

oh .
uh , i was going to finish it but , uh , mr. gerson is out with , uh , rickets .
he said definitely don' t do it until his rickets are are cured .
and , you know , i i i really
who knows if he' s ever telling the truth ?
bernie ,

no , no , no , no .
tadpole .
tadpole .

mad bull .
asshole .
no , jack' s mole .
' cause jack has a big mole on his face .
is your father the mechanic ?
oh , i i don' t know , i never met him .
never met your dad , huh ?
oh , that' s unfortunate .
but very interesting .
mind if i take a picture of you ?
you know , just for fun .
okay .
asshole .
okay .
just hang on a second there .
yeah .
hello .
hi , it' s me .
how' s it going with the little one ?
horribly .
he' s crying and screaming , and cursing .
that poor kid is desperate for human contact .
honey , you need to hold him , and kiss him , do whatever it takes .
i' ve been hugging him in secret , feeding him chocolates , too .
all animals have babies
say hello to my little friend !
you know , he' s probably teething .
so put a dab of rum in his milk .
and it' il ease the pain , he' il go to sleep .
you want me to give him a drink ?
i' m talking , less than a thimbleful .
you don' t want jack coming home to a screaming baby .
listen to your mother .
goodbye .
i love you .
all right , mom .
hey , little jack , i got a surprise for you .
little jack ?
mr. moose is looking for you .
oh , shit !
where the hell did he go ?
l. j. !
little jack !
l. j. !
l. j. !
does that jorge resemble anyone you know ?
no one i know .
hmm .
there' s something you don' t see every day .
focker !
focker !
okay .
i know this looks bad , but i can explain it .
what the hell happened ?
i said no monkey business .
no .
there was no monkey business .
no monkey business ?
you' re wearing my breast , little jack is drinking ,
moses is sodomizing jinx , and you' re telling me there' s no monkey business ?
what is going on here ?
you all right , l. j. ?
hello !
we' re home !
hey , guys .
give me the bottle .
what' s happened to little jack ?
his hands are stuck to the bottle of rum .
thank you , dad .
you bet they' re stuck .
greg , how did this happen ?
and why are you wearing antlers ?
it' s very complicated .
it' s just a little glue .
he' s fine .
he' s not fine .
if he could use his hands , he' d tell you himself .
all right .
that' s all right .
come on .
little jack , honey , are you okay ?
greg ...
dina .
pam .
yes , dad , uh ...
i' m coming .
little jack .
honey , i said a thimble , not a bottle .
oh , greg .
hey .
how' s the little guy doing ?
everything is just as good as new .
yeah .
dad , come on .
is he all right ?
he' s asleep .
i don' t care if they did call you larry poppins .
you are completely unfit to handle a child .
it was barry poppins .
what kind of sick cocktail were you gonna make my grandson ?
jack , the baby' s teething .
i told greg to give him some rum to ease the pain .
it was your idea ?
yes .
what is wrong with you people ?
i used to rub bourbon on denny' s gums .
yeah !
look what happened to him .
greg , you couldn' t follow a simple set of instructions ?
jack , he was screaming .
so i went in and gave him a little attention .
okay ?
he' s learning to self soothe .
these setbacks are disastrous for his development .
the child is adorable , but you' re not raising little buddha over here .
mom .
what are you saying ?
i' m saying that i' ve seen that kid eat at least 15 boogers since he' s been here and i' ve got news for you , jack , prodigies don' t eat their own boogers .
and i have news for you .
prodigies don' t come in 10th place every time either .
okay , dad .
that' s my fianc .
i' m sorry .
i' ve never seen people celebrate mediocrity the way you do .
because we love our son ?
we hug our son ?
let' s get down to it .
the truth is , you' re so concerned about that little jack , but i think that it' s the little jack in you who' s crying out for a hug .
the little jack in me ?
jack , you have issues .
i' m trying to understand why you run around with a rubber boob strapped to your chest .
were you ever breastfed ?
mom , stop .
key question .
my guess is no .
spare me the drugstore psychology .
everybody !
all right .
everybody just ...
everybody just stop , okay ?
jack , i am not going to make any excuses .
yes ,
little jack wouldn' t stop crying so i gave him some hugs and i let him watch tv .
i went to answer the phone , i was gone a second , i came back in , he let himself out of the playpen , he put on scarface , and he glued his hands to the rum bottle .
okay ?
that' s it .
oh .
that' s it
greg just said , " that' s it .
so i feel much better now .
daddy , would you mind ...
please , daddy .
he made an honest mistake .
let it go .
he' s fine , greg .
he' s asleep .
he spoke .
asshole .
what ?
did he say what i am thinking ?
i think he did .
little jack , what did you just say ?
asshole .
his first word ?
it just slipped out of my mouth .
i
he has a mind like a sponge .
that' s enough .
i' m calling a family conference .
oh , it' s a great idea , jack .
let' s finally get your problems out on the table .
no , no , i mean with my own family .
excuse us .
i' d like to talk to pam and dina in private .
of course , of course , take your time .
come on , honey .
i' m not so sure this wedding is such a good idea .
to say the least , i don' t like what i' m seeing from these fockers .
what ?
has greg ever mentioned the name jorge to you ?
jor
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
no , why ?
because i think your fianc may have a few skeletons in his closet that he is not telling you about .
and skeletons don' t like living in closets .
oh , my god , here we go again .
dad , listen , you know , greg has no skeletons .
okay ?
oh , really ?
he does not .
do you know that ?
yes , i know that .
will you just i' m not a child .
i see .
she knows that .
this wedding will happen .
and the sooner you accept that , the better it' s going to be for all of us .
i can' t talk to you .
no .
wait a second , sweetheart .
and i' m not so sure roz is a yoga instructor , either .
jack , you promised that you' d behave yourself .
and what you said to those people was really hurtful .
i think you should go up there and apologize .
i' m not going to apologize to them .
jack .
a little birdie told me that somebody' s going to be a daddy .
mom !
sorry , honey , but look at that face .
how could i keep it a secret ?
he' s so excited about being a grandpa .
what should he call me ?
how about poppy ?
you don' t have to have champagne , okay ?
why ?
jack' s really angry .
i know he' s mad , but he' s also a little meshuggenah .
come on , honey .
how often do we get to be grandparents ?
we' re having a toast .
okay , fine , but , dad , this is a secret .
we can' t tell jack till after we are married .
why ?
we are honest people .
no !
i can' t stand this secrecy anymore .
why ?
be quiet .
why should we diminish our joy just because they live in denial ?
seriously .
i promised pam , okay ?
she thinks it' il break his heart if he finds out .
i' m not gonna take a drink .
your father' s right .
this is the 21st century !
married or not , there' s no shame in fatherhood !
this is the fruit of your loins .
that is so beautiful .
say that to him again .
this is the fruit of your loins !
this is the fruit of your loins !
okay .
let' s toast and let' s make a sandwich , and mom wants to be the cheese .
jack byrnes , what are you doing ?
what did you do ?
you okay there , jacko ?
what' s the matter what happened ?
i was , uh , coming to apologize and my back went into spasm .
it' s very tender from that horrific football accident .
yeah , i feel it .
my god , you' re knotted like a pretzel .
you must be in a lot of pain , huh ?
i don' t mind pain .
i learn from pain .
pain shmain .
my fingers are magic .
come on , let me work out the kinks .
oh .
that' s a lovely offer , jack .
uh , no , thanks .
i' il be fine .
my wife does wonderful bodywork , jack .
i don' t think he needs it .
okay , handsome , shirt off .
i' d rather have it on , thank you .
oh , no dice .
no , no , no .
it has to come off .
ah , lovely .
you know , most back pain is psychological .
we carry our emotional baggage right here in our muscles .
i' ve been watching you , jack .
studying your body language .
and you' re a very sensual man .
but i' m not sure you realize that .
what are you doing ?
it' s a technique i learned in hawaii .
it' s a lomi lomi massage named after the gentle waves of the polynesian sea .
the waves go in , and the waves go out .
the waves go in .
whoops .
hit some driftwood .
jack byrnes , you are a caged lion .
but lions can' t be captives their entire lives .
they have to be free to roam the bush , free and wild .
your wife is a hot , sexy tigress and she' s waiting for you to pounce on her .
let me hear you roar , baby , roar .
your body is talking to me .
it' s hungry for action .
i can feel it .
unleash the beast inside you .
mom , stop it .
you' re hurting him .
i am not hurting him .
i am helping him .
just don' t don' t
i don' t think you should move just yet .
jack , come back for an afternoon session .
it' il do you good .
what' re you doing ?
we were so close .
i could feel it .
i was getting through to him .
the guy doesn' t like to be touched .
because he has the emotional hide of a rhinoceros .
don' t break him down .
just let him be .
i was trying to do you a favour .
you were riding him like seabiscuit , mom .
dial foxtrot one .
alpha , foxtrot one .
foxtrot one .
i need a full comparative dna analysis on one gaylord m focker and one jorge villalobos .
translation , george , house of the wolves .
it might take a couple of weeks , santa .
no good , foxtrot one , i need a 12 hour turnaround .
i' il secure the physical evidence and the handoff will be at harry focker' s good time supper club , 2100 hours tonight .
you got it , santa .
foxtrot one out .
yello ?
bernie , this is jack byrnes .
hey , jack .
hey , where are you calling from ?
i' m in my rv .
would you have greg meet me here in three minutes ?
you' re in your trailer ?
thank you , goodbye .
but ...
hey , gaylord !
jack wants you to meet him in his trailer in precisely three minutes .
and i have to tell you ,
ei stiffo was really starting to freak me out .
greg , wait , okay ?
listen , no matter how hard he probes you , you have to promise me that you will not break because i' m not ready to tell him i' m pregnant .
hey , honey .
honey .
what ?
what ?
let him probe ,
' cause he' s probing a brick wall .
now show me how you would like a romantic evening to go .
oh , jack , wine and candles ?
gosh , it' s not even our anniversary .
come here , hot stuff .
yes , yes .
oh , jack .
jack ?
down here , under the bed .
down here , greg .
wow .
have a seat .
watch the panel .
this is incredible .
so this is like your , uh , mobile command centre for all your spy activities ?
mainly a secure space for me to spend some alone time and reflect on my thoughts .
mmm .
very cool .
greg .
yeah ?
you' il recall , we had a discussion earlier in the week regarding my feelings about family , legacies , children and so forth .
oh , yeah , of course i recall .
yeah .
i' m going to just ask you once .
is there anything you want to tell me regarding things that might have happened ?
unplanned things ?
things involving the fruit of your loins ?
no .
well , if he' s not going to admit it on his own ...
hello ?
hello , jorge ?
it' s jack byrnes , remember me ?
oh , yeah .
sure .
you came to the house with bernie .
you had that fancy camera pen .
yeah , that' s right .
listen , do you have any plans tonight ?
uh , no .
good , ' cause i' d like to invite you to a party .
hey .
sweetie .
having a good time ?
uh , no , not really .
no ?
hey , listen , sweetie , did you tell your mother i' m pregnant ?
because she keeps touching my stomach and smiling like that .
yeah .
no , i didn' t tell her .
she just , she guessed .
she what ?
yeah , and then she told my dad .
oh , my god .
stop it , bernie .
bernie , stop .
it' s not funny .
i told my mom .
what ?
yeah .
what ?
why' d you ...
your dad will definitely find out .
she knows my dad .
she' d never say a word .
no , no .
but he' s very suspicious .
greg .
hi .
hey .
hi .
honey , would you take this to your mother ?
it' s a wine spritzer .
that' s all she drinks now .
you boys have fun .
nice .
nice party .

yeah , it is .
it' s nice .
it' s got a nice festive vibe .

oh , hey , thanks for the invite , mr. b.
greg , this is jorge villalobos .
hey .
hey , how you doing ?
isabel' s son .
oh , i didn' t realize isabel had a son .
when did she get married ?
she she' s not married .
oh , he' s never met his father .
oh .
i' m sorry .
that' s , i mean , that' s that' s too bad .
oh , no , no , it' s it' s cool .
my mom said my dad wasn' t like , mature enough to deal with a kid , anyway , so , yeah .
so how do you guys know each other ?
oh , this young man is quite the mechanic .
and he' s only 15 years old .
isn' t that impressive ?
really ?
you' re 15 ?
yeah .
that is impressive .
he' s a handsome kid , huh ?
yeah .
almost like a young , half hispanic marlon brando .
well ,
i' il leave you two guys to talk .
you probably have a lot in common .
well , hmm .
so you' re 15 .
come on , let' s conga .
did you order the tom collins , sir ?
is it made with fresh lemon juice ?
they' re bermuda lemons , sir .
and i squeezed them myself .
stay safe , santa .
i mean , it' s romantic out here , don' t you think ?
the moon , the sea , isn' t it nice ?
hmm .
yeah , it' s nice .
you look very handsome tonight , jack .
oh .
thank you , honey .
what are you doing to my ears ?
nothing .
hey !
i have to go to the bathroom , i' il be right back .
okay .
hello , greg .
hi , jack .
did you have a nice conversation with your son ?
jack , i' ve never even met that kid before .
focker , you' ve been covering this up from the very beginning .
no , i haven' t , jack .
it' s just another one of your crazy theories .
greg .
you' re still in the circle of trust , so i' m gonna give you one more chance .
are you ready to admit that you' ve been hiding this from pam ?
no , i haven' t .
you' re not hiding anything ?
no , all right ?
oh , greg .
what are you holding ?
what' s in your hand ?
nothing .
jack , i can see it in the mirror .
what is it ?
you got something in your hand .
don' t worry about it , greg .
is that a needle ?
yes , it is .
you seem tense .
i was going to offer you a sedative .
you' re joking , right ?
no , i' m not .
jack .
is that tartar sauce on your shoulder ?
tartar sauce ?
why ?
you' ve been injected with a highly concentrated dose of sodium pentothal .
truth serum .
you won' t recall this in a few minutes and tonight , for the first time in your life , my young friend , you are going to be honest .
keep the pressure on it .
get down , little jack .
get funky .
oh .
hey there , preggers .
quiet .
how' re you doin ' ?
fine , where' ve you been ?
i went to the bathroom to pee and now i' m talking to you , my fiance , who i' ve delayed marrying for two years because i didn' t want our parents to meet .
what ?
what ?
what ?
you don' t like me ?
it' s okay .
i don' t like your little red outfit .
makes you look like a little demon baby .
maybe i' il get you a little pitchfork for christmas , huh , so we can put you on a can of underwood ham .
i' m sorry that i can' t make little " poop " sounds and i can' t make little things that tell people when i wanna do things .
and guess what ?
i can make a sign to you , too .
how' s that for a sign ?
uh oh .
look , bernie' s gone up on the stage .
come .
now , to say a few words , one of the great registered nurses of all time ,
gaylord myron focker .
come on , let' s give it up to gay .
give it up to him .
bernie focker !
i love the shirt , dad .
thank you .
all right .
it' s great to be here with all of you as i am about to set sail in my ship of life , with my first mate , the beautiful young blonde lass over there .
hey , baby .
i love you , honey .
i still masturbate to pam .
greg .
what ?
it' s true .
honey , what ?
come on , you' re hot .
look at her .
look at those boobs .

i just wanna lather them up with soap and just ...
i love it .
man , i just wanna just wanna nestle in there and just take a little vacation in there .
honey .
honey , what ?
i' m sorry .
okay , excuse me for you being perfect .
hey , you know who else is great ?
that woman over there .
my future mother in law , dina byrnes .
you know , they say if you really wanna know what a woman will look like when she gets older , you should look at her mother .
well , i' m a lookin ' and i' m a likin ' .
look at her !
sweetness !
good genes , the byrnes gene pool .
hey , hey , you .
yeah , you .
hold on .
pam , i gotta tell you something about about this little dude right here .
in my first really passionate sexual awakening ,
i did , in fact , lose my virginity to our beautiful housekeeper , isabel .
greg , honey , that was in the past .
so why don' t you come sit down ?
no , no , honey , ' cause i have to get this off my chest , really .
sit .
we conceived a child .
and his name is jorge villalobos .
come up here , jorge .
come up here .
let' s lift the veil of mystery .
the fruit of my loins is right here .
everybody take a look .
see his face .
he' s mine .
search your feelings , jorge .
you know it to be true .
it' s okay .
i know .
i know .
lot of information .
you let it settle .
who' d have thunk it , huh ?
come on , give that kid a hand .
oh , and , uh , jack ?
pam' s pregnant .
focker out .
hey .
hey .
what happened last night ?
well , you got drunk and told my dad i' m pregnant .
you revealed you have a 15 year old son named jorge .
and , oh , apparently you have the hots for my mom .
oh , my god .
i i ...
you mean , is that really true ?
i think she' s attractive .
no , that you have a son you never told me about .
i ...
honey , if it is ,
i never heard about it before last night .
isabel never said anything to me .
i i ...
i mean .
i don' t even remember drinking .
you' re telling me the truth , aren' t you ?
of course , i am .
pam ,
i love you .
i would never lie to you about anything like that .
i love you , too .
and if jorge really is your son , then we will make it work .
okay .
i ...
hey , how did your dad react to the pregnancy news ?
well , just as you' d expect .
he slept in the rv .
he hasn' t spoken to anyone since last night .
pam , we have to leave this island .
get in the rv right now .
bernard , get out from under the vehicle or i will run you over .
i' m not moving , jack .
there' s a non violent way to handle this .
what' s going on ?
well , your father wants to leave , and bernie is staging a sit in .
dad , come on , get up .
this is ridiculous .
you weren' t around in the ' 60s , man .
this is how we got things done .
pam , dina , we have to get off this island .
it' s evil .
jack byrnes , out of the rv .
you are acting like such a jerk .
yes , there you go .
jacko !
yes .
man , we' re gonna have a grandchild .
come on , we should be celebrating .
how could you not see it ?
greg is completely unfit to handle a child .
he' s neglected his own son for 15 years .
hey , jack , i didn' t even know he existed .
that' s right .
who knows what to believe with you ?
you' re dishonest about everything .
you' re so much better , jack ?
why don' t you tell everybody what you did last night to greg at the party .
muskrat , dina .
oh , stuff your muskrat , jack .
he shot greg with truth serum before his speech .
what ?
yeah , i found this in his pocket .
here we go again , dad .
he did the same thing to pam' s junior prom date .
wait a minute .
yes , yes .
wait a minute .
you stuck a needle in my neck .
you drugged my son ?
i had no choice .
he refuses to tell the truth .
because he' s terrified , and he thinks he has to impress you .
he' s had us trying to impress you , but in my opinion ,
jack , i think it' s you who should be trying to impress us .
jack .
you' ve insulted me , my wife , my son , our entire way of life .
i' ve sat back and taken it .
but now , you' ve crossed the line , sir .
and i' m gonna have to kick your ass .
dad , dad , wait a second .
i' m gonna teach this florist some justice , focker style .
just calm down .
just give me a minute to stretch .
bernie , you' re gonna hurt yourself .
we can talk this through .
it' s too late for words , rosalind .
dad , dad , no , no , please , no dance fighting .
stop !
this is capoeira , man .
this is hardcore shit .
bernard , if you continue , you will force me to engage you .
and once i begin the sequence of combat , it can only end with your demise .
bring it , dog .
come on .
bring it .
come on .
he' s taunting me .
dad .
greg !
greg !
what , bernie , you' re gonna snap now ?
greg !
what ?
now look what you did .
it' s your fault .
he' s bleeding .
he' s bleeding , daddy .
that' s it .
pam , dina ,
i' m calling a family conference .
come on .
no , dad , this is the family .
all right ?
in a few weeks , i' m not gonna be pam byrnes .
i' m gonna be pamela focker .
or byrnes focker .
we haven' t totally decided yet .
no , no , no , i' m gonna be pamela martha focker .
i know how that sounds , but but that' s the name i' m taking .
pamcake , you' re upset .
i' m not so sure you' re thinking clearly right now .
i' m trying , dad .
it' s you who is not thinking clearly .
these two kids love each other .
look .
we' ve been kvelling about this pregnancy all weekend .
you knew she was pregnant ?
we all did , jack .
daddy , i was gonna tell you after the wedding , i swear .
this is the reason i created the circle of trust so we could discuss these things .
the circle isn' t gonna work if you don' t trust anyone that' s in it , dad .
dad .
jack , don' t .
no , dad .
daddy .
honey .
daddy , please .
daddy , where are you going ?
jack .
come on .
daddy , come back , please .
this is nicht gut .
is it ringing ?
there' s no answer .
well , let' s give him some space .
maybe he' s learning to self soothe .
roz .
what ?
this is crazy .
i' m going .
i' m coming with you , son .
no , dad , i can do it myself .
we gotta make up time .
i know these roads
like the back of my hand .
come on , let' s put this family back together .
dad , i know a shortcut .
it will lead us to the freeway .
i think you make a right up here or a left .
it' s either one or the other .
you don' t know where we are , do you ?
you know , something' s wrong here .
this makes no sense at all .
dad , it' s a map of detroit .
oh , well , that explains it .
dad .
punch it , gay .
we gotta catch that dude .
oh , shit .
come on .
come on .
keep going .
dad , come on , it' s a cop .
listen carefully .
let me do the talking .
i know how to handle the local cops .
no , don' t don' t do any talking .
don' t shush me , i' m a lawyer .
i' m not shushing you .
you know how many tickets i' ve talked myself out of ?
oh , wow .
will you look at this guy .
don' t they have height requirements ?
we' re screwed .
no , we' re not .
don' t . don' t , dad , he said to remain in the vehicle .
sir , i said to remain in your vehicle .
i just wanna talk to you for one second .
let' s just talk like friendly floridians .
if you fail to comply , i will arrest you .
you see , my son' s future father in law thinks my gay back there has a bastard son .
i said shut it .
shut it .
i know my civil rights now .

50, 000 volts of electricity are now passing into your skeletal muscle tissue .
your central nervous system has been incapacitated but you will regain motor functions momentarily .

check it out .
he' s got a rubber booby .
what' s going on ?
what' s going on ?
i was talking to judge goldfarb .
it' s done , we' re out .
i thought you were making a call .
we don' t need it .
i ran into the judge in the hall .
i took care of everything .
yeah , right .
what' re you saying , jack ?
i' m saying , if you had kept your mouth shut in the first place we wouldn' t be in this mess .
i' m a lawyer , jack .
i' m trying to get us out of here .
what' d you do , give the judge your fondue recipe ?
at least i' m comfortable enough in my own skin to cook for my family .
when' s the last time you gave your wife breakfast in bed ?
when is the last time you gave her anything in bed ?
now you' re out of line , focker .
you' re out of line , man .
no , you hurt my feelings there , and there' s no reason to hurt my feelings .
would you guys stop ?
he insulted me .
well , this isn' t about you , all right ?
it' s not about either of you .
it' s about me and pam .
we' re getting married .
that' s it .
we' re starting our own circle of trust .
and guess what ?
you' re not in it .
oh , you can' t start a circle of trust .
it' s my circle .
you don' t have a patent on the circle , jack .
by the way , you' re not even in your own circle right now .
that is untrue .
i say who' s in or out of the circle .
well , i' m confused .
whose circle am i in ?
nobody' s .
look , we' re starting a family , okay ?
we we' re gonna have a baby .
i have a 15 year old son .
you guys gotta put aside your issues and and do what' s best for us .
okay ?
greg , jorge is not your son .
what ?
i had a comparative dna analysis done last night .
and i made a mistake .
you made a mistake ?
yes , i did .
wait a minute .
truth serum , dna matches .
who the hell are you , jack byrnes ?
i' m not really a florist , bernard .
i was in the cla for 32 years .
and i retired right before i met greg .
oh , sure .
well , that makes sense .
bernie , what the heck are you still doing here ?
ira .
open up , let these guys out .
judge , what exactly did he say to you ?
he didn' t have to say anything .
dr. roz saved my marriage .
i' d do anything for that woman .
you tell sugar pants
i' il see her in class next week .
will do , ira .
thanks .
well , what can i say ?
i' m married to a powerful woman .
all right , gentlemen .
let' s go .
excuse me .
what ?
can you close the cell door ?
focker !
you want to remain in the cell ?
we' re not done talking yet .
what ?
so , what do you think , huh ?
hmm ?
can we work this out or not ?
okay .
jack ?
uh ...
good enough .
all right , then , uh ,
i think pam and i should should get married this weekend .
this weekend ?
oh , i' m not so sure that' s a good idea .
you wanna be in the circle or not , jack ?
okay , we' il do it this weekend .
oh , jack .
hey , i think i can get judge ira to marry you guys .
oh , i don' t think so .
but if it' s all right with you , greg ,
i already have a minister in mind .
oh my god , daddy .
you didn' t !
meeting greg made such an impression on kevin , he spent eight months in israel on a kibbutz , then he took an internet course and got ordained as an inter faith minister .
jack told me you were okay with me conducting the ceremony .
i hope that' s true .
yeah , yeah , no , i think it' s great .
i mean , it is a little weird .
you listen to me when i say this .
pam and i didn' t have one tenth of the spiritual connection that you two obviously share .
i mean , i look at you both together and you' re beautiful .
i get it .
okay ?
okay , thank you , kevin .
thank you , greg .
you' re gonna be a great mom , pamcake .
thank you , daddy .
and who gives this woman to this man ?
i do .
jack tiberius byrnes .
daddy .
sorry , greg .
she' s all yours now .
that was sweet , honey .
are you all right ?
shalom , everyone .
shalom .
which is hebrew for " what' s going on ?
let us begin with the blessing of the wine .
amen .
kevin .
what ?
yeah , go ahead .
well , hi .
rosalind .
yeah .
i just have to say i underestimated you .
oh .
when it comes to relationships
i' m starting to see that you might actually know what you' re talking about .
i appreciate that , jack .
really , thank you .
i also was curious about the advice you gave judge ira .
mmm .
is that classified information ?
i thought you' d never ask .
i' m gonna give you a crash course , okay ?
come here .
really ?
uh huh .
and i do that for how many minutes ?
hey !
there' s my brother from another mother .
congratulations , jacko .
put that away , bernard .
we' re family now .
we' re family .
now , if you' il excuse me ,
i have some unfinished business to take care of .
go get her , tiger .
we fockerized him .
sure did .
i' d like to fockerize you .
sweetheart , do we have to hurry like this ?
honey , we' re in a covert operation .
the bandleader told me we have 23 minutes before they cut the cake .
jack , what are you doing ?
little trick bernie taught me .
now let' s find out , l. j. , why the ferber method isn' t working .
oh , hi , baby .
hi , little jack .
okay .
oh , look what i brought you .
oh , what did i bring ?
a chocolate .
for the baby .
yummy , is that good ?
i know you' re not supposed to have this .
grandpa jack doesn' t like chocolate .
but he' s a little , you know , whacko .
don' t tell him , okay ?
you know what ?
i got some cake in the refrigerator .
later i' il bring you that , okay ?
chocolate cake .
good boy .
but don' t tell anyone , okay ?
one more .
you yell and scream all you want .
make noise , that' s what this country' s all about .
i think we' ve got a little protester on our hands .
oh , it figures ,
i should' ve known this was gonna go on .
always question authority .
you have to question everything ei stiffo grandpa jack says .
you know why ?
because ' he' s full of ...
because he' s full of ...
grandpa jack is full of ...
grandpa jack is full of ...
there he is .
little man jack .
how' re you doing ?
can i interest you in a little vodka ?
just kidding .
i' m , like , uh , officially your uncle now .
so i was thinking maybe i should give you some uncley advice .
you know , little hints for surviving in this family
' cause you gotta learn to keep secrets from your psycho grandpa jack .
he was really upset when you crawled out of the playpen .
which is why we never tell him that instead of watching you ,
i was actually out by the lagoon smoking a little reefer .
or that whole thing about pam being pregnant .
there' s no little focker on the way .
whole thing was just made up so jack would let us get married .
but
you gotta do what you gotta do , right ?
that' s cute , that little alligator tchotchke thing .
what' s that in its mouth ?
it' s got like a a camera !
busted .
hi , jack .
i knew you were there all along .
i was just , uh , doin ' a little show for you .
you know i don' t smoke pot or anything , and pam is pregnant .
you should' ve seen the look on your face , though .
oh , so good .
asshole .
hey , look at me , jack , what am i ?
i am a frozen caveman .
study me , jack .
learn how strange the focker genetic code is .
we are weird mutants who hug and kiss .
we show emotion .
jack must learn from us and chip away with his hammer of truth .
ha , focker .
wooga booga .
