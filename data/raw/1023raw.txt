you lookjust fine to me , willard .
and you' re dismissed .
but , it' s disintegrating .
the buttons are barely hanging on .
willard , that is a terrific suit .
your father worked for me for 30 years .
wore that suit every day .

yeah , and then he died .
and then , at the funeral , you made the undertaker give it back to you ... ... so you could stick me in it for another 15 years .
just what are you implying ?
miss crock , it' s christmas time .
i' m only asking for a new uniform .
only " a new uniform ?
and pretty soon it' il be " only " a new broom , maybe .
and before you know it , i will be " only " bankrupt !

willard , you need to make a new year' s resolution .
quit working for the ball buster .
show her who' s boss , man .
take a shit in her soup .
thanks .
that' s real constructive .
you know how things are today .
a man has a job , he holds onto it .
ln your case , till he dies of old age .
yeah , like my old man .
you know what he said to me on his deathbed ?
he said , " stick with miss crock .
you' il get ahead .
i don' t know what he was talking about .

i can' t believe i' ve tolerated him for as long as i have .

willard' s exploited your generosity .
that' s exactly right .
i mean his father , teddy , was a nice man .
but enough is enough .
really .
well , tomorrow , we' il ... ... fire him .
throw his stuff in the furnace .
santa claus must be stopped .
there will be no christmas this year .
you got that right .

because she' s mean .
she picked christmas day to do it .

you need revenge .
revenge !
we need revenge !
revenge !
we need revenge !
let' s kidnap santa claus .

maybe those moon men are ...
... onto something .
you mean we should kidnap santa ?
wait a minute .
why don' t we just kidnap miss crock ?
no , it' s crazy .
no , that' s brilliant !
we' il grab granny and hold her ass for ransom .
and if they don' t pay , we start hacking off her fingers .
first her thumb , then her pointer ... ... then her little nasty finger .
what are you talking about ?
we' re not criminals .
you fry chicken , i drive a car .
when that money comes rolling in , i' il go crazy , man !
i' il laminate my menus .
shut up , okay ?
we know nothing about kidnapping an old lady .
but what about her dog ?
you mean biscuit ?
no , muffin .
yeah , she loves him more than anything in the world .
i bet she' d pay plenty for that old bag of fleas .
yeah , i bet she' d pay $1 million .
remember , we have to be quiet inside the house .
miss crock is a light sleeper .
you ain' t gotta worry about me .
this place is nice .
what the hell are you doing ?
i' m checking for electric eyes .
there' s no electric eyes .
how do you know ?
they' re invisible .
trust me .
i' ve lived here my entire life .
so , this is where the old bitch sleeps ?
okay , give me the weenie .

this thing is eating my hand !
jesus , this is a nightmare !
put him in the box !
who' s smarter ?
now who' s smarter ?
what should it say ?
we' ve got him .
pay us $1 million , or he' s a dead dog !
how does that sound ?
fine .
let' s get the hell out of here .
$1 million !
this is the happiest day of my life .
with that money , we can do anything .
i know what i' m gonna do .
i' m gonna buy me a four star chicken hole .
i' il get a better neighborhood and a listing in the zagat guide .
i' m going someplace warm where you don' t need layered clothing .
start over .
i got some good years left in me .
i can better myself .
i' m gonna register at one of them four year universities .
my friend ... ... here' s to second chances .
did you have a lovely sleep , muffin ?
yes .
now , we' il have a lovely breakfast , you and ....
oh , my god !
look at me .
muffin !
look what they' ve done to your mother .
i don' t know ....
we' ve got him .
pay us $1 million or he' s a dead dog .
who' s a dead dog ?
willard ?
man , we' ve got so many choices .
i' m just trying to get out of pittsburgh .
you said it .
check out this .
bora bora .
i was thinking more like caribbean myself .
whichever one has a school with a strong liberal arts program .
lord !
i' m dead !
we' re going to jail .
what do you mean " we " ?
that' s my picture on the front page .
who would have thought kidnapping a dog would make the front page ?
wait a minute .
they think it was me .
they think i was kidnapped .
they don' t even mention muffin .
why would somebody kidnap you ?
i don' t know , but they think someone did .
there were signs of a scuffle , the chauffeur' s blood was on a wall ...
... and a note demanded $1 million ...
... or he' s a dead dog .
sweet jesus !
we kidnapped a turd .
according to sources , the missing chauffeur had been ... ... a loyal employee for over 15 years .
virginia crock , known for her mouthwatering treats ... ... awoke this morning to news that was not so sweet .
do you have any enemies ?
not that i know of .
i' m just an elderly lady who makes pies .
well , does mr. fillmore have any enemies ?
who ?
that' s willard' s last name .
not that i know of .
did he have anybody that he used to bring around the house ?
not that i know of .
does he have any living relatives ?
not that i know of .
ma' am ... ... excuse me , but ... ... this man worked for you for over a decade ... ... and you don' t know if he has any friends or any relatives ?
detective , miss crock has told you everything she knows .
what do you mean ?
she hasn' t told me anything .
sir , if it makes you happy ... ... you go right ahead and find willard fillmore .
as for me ... ... it' s time for my nap .
sources say that fillmore moved to pittsburgh at the age ofsix .
here' s the thing .
i hardly knew willard .
police say ifyou have any information , call the piehunt hotline at 1 800
how did this get so big ?
rusty , we gotta turn ourselves in .
how ?
they think you' re the victim .
shit !
you have to be really dumb to accidentally kidnap yourself .
wait a minute .
this is all gonna get pinned on me !
you gotta get un kidnapped !
you gotta escape !
the kidnappers go out to dinner , you chew through the ropes , you get away .
yeah , that' s good .
that' s good , but it should be real .
there was a struggle and i got all bruised and beat up !
this is an airtight alibi .
here .
let me help you .
good .
you like that , right ?
yeah , wait a minute .
what ?
i got an idea .
what are we worried about ?
why don' t i just stay kidnapped ?
why ?
it makes perfect sense .
lnstead of them paying $1 million for muffin , they pay it for me .
why would somebody pay $1 million for you ?
' cause i' m a man .
muffin' s a dog .
yeah , but he got a pedigree .
gimme a break , i' m better than he is !
come on !
i' m better than a dog !
i' m five times better .
" $5 million .
it' s repugnant .
it' s like a rising stock .
why did he jump from one to five ?
all right , man .
let' s see some real emotion here .
you' re kidnapped .
let' s see some tears .
i want to feel something real .
and action !
help !
save me !
miss crock , i' m begging you , please !
i got into msnbc .
how do you plug that camera in ?
i think like this .
in a startling development in the pittsburgh kidnapping ... ... this shocking videotape was e mailed to msnbc .
help , miss crock , save me !
i' m begging you !
they got me wearing chains !
i' m living in a cage .
they' re gonna kill me ifyou don' tpay .
open your wallet , you tight ass !
jesus , somebody has to do something !
dinnertime , dog .
they got me eating kibble .
i don' t know how much longer i can last .
oh , god , chip ... ... he' s wearing a collar .
collars don' t hurt .
they' re just trying to intimidate us .
whatis that ?
is that urine ?
itis !
itis !
it' s human urine !
chip , we' re late .
miss crock !
what' s your reaction to the kibble video ?
have you changed your mind about paying the ransom ?
she' il not deal with criminals .
it' s a police matter .
your chauffeur was chained like a dog .
where' s your compassion ?
i' il show you compassion .
get your asses off my property !
i' m afraid you didn' t hear me .
i' m afraid you didn' t hear me !
today , dessert baron virginia crock , reiterated she will notpay the ransom .
we went to the man in the street to find out what he thinks .
she' s rich .
she can afford it .
if i worked for that ... chowder ... slut ... ... i' d tell her to ... get down , get busy on my ... man .
more concerned citizens have started a formal protest .
no more pies if willard dies !
ls that hillary ?
she' s looking good .
rich people are no good .
i' m never gonna eat herpie again .
this media blitz is killing us .
our sales have dropped 50 percent .
miss crock , go to hell !
miss crock
miss crock , many bad things are happened .
we thought we were buying your wholesome american image .
but it' s terrible shock that you don' t rescue your loyal houseman .
sweet old lady on pie box is now super villain .
i' m sorry , honey .
they' re playing hardball .
lf you don' t pay up , they' re gonna walk .
fuck !
of course i' m gonna pay the ransom .
ijust didn' t want to encourage those underworld criminals .
but now i want willard home again with me .
the old hag is coughing up !
thank you , miss crock .
and thank you , hillary , for kicking her ass !
i' m free !
we are millionaires !
anybody here ?
hello ?
what can i do for you ?
are you rusty p. hayes ?
yes , i am .
can i interest you in my shrimp boat special ?
no .
i' m here investigating the kidnapping of willard fillmore .
who ?
you must have read about him .
i don' t read newspapers .
we thought you might know him .
we were going through mr. fillmore' s belongings ... ... and we found this " chicken dinner special " punch card .
really ?
yeah , this guy .
i was wondering what happened to him .
he was kidnapped .
when he came in here , did he ... ... ever do anything unusual that would draw attention to him ?
one time i seen him eat 50 chicken gizzards all by himself .
look , if you come across anything that might help us ...
... give me a call .
sure .
i hate loose ends ... ... and i want this case to end .
i was so scared , i thought i was gonna pee in my pants .
he knows something .
he had a funny look on his face .
why' d you tell him so much ?
i didn' t tell him nothing .
i told him about the time you ate 50 chicken gizzards .
that wasn' t me !
that was some chinese guy .
fong did do that , didn' t he ?
i' m telling you , we got problems .
that evil kojak hates loose ends .
and when they pay and i don' t show up , that' s a loose end .
he' il go nuts !
you' il be some place nice , like jamaica .
yeah , well , he' il track me there .
wait a minute .
what if we fooled them and made them think i was dead ?
like maybe if we borrowed a corpse .
don' t we know somebody who knows somebody ... ... who works at the morgue ?
hillary used to live across the street ... ... from a dude who was in the army with this guy who worked at the morgue .
i forgot it was hillary .
yeah , you can' t hit her up , man .
she just walked a picket line for you .
oh , my god !
i never thought i' d see you again , and here you are .
i brought you flowers .
oh , my god !
wow !
you' re such a class act .
you get ransomed , then you buy me flowers .
well , i didn' t get ransomed , per se .
did you escape ?
no , i didn' t escape literally .
shit .
where' d they go ?
all right , how did you do it ?
it was really no problem .
grover .
damn !
did all that in ten minutes .
spooky !
grover ?
what are you doing ?
get away from that .
i' m sorry .
it' s just a rock .
it' s not just a rock .
it' s a pet rock .
a pet rock .
i haven' t seen one of these in years .
yeah .
i just dug it out of his colon .
yeah , it' s still warm .
i got a whole collection .
it' s really amazing ... ... what you dig out of the inside of dead people when you cut them open .
people swallow everything .
here' s some dice .
the guy must have been to vegas .
got all kinds of stuff here .
this beautiful harmonica .
don' t put that in your mouth .
this is interesting here .
yes .
you gotta go in that way .
it couldn' t have gone in this way .
he would have noticed .
a broom ?
where' d it go ?
oh , forget about it .
he' s dead , and then you find it .
you know , it' s all kinds of stuff like that .
this is good .
yeah .
it' s a clicker .
hey , honey , where' s the clicker ?
i don' t know .
lnside me .
here .
look at this .
a perfectly good comb .
grover , how would you like to make $100, 000 ?
well , that' s a lot of cheese .
what i gotta do ?
i want people to think that i' m dead .
dead ?
yeah , you just take one of the dead bodies and dress it up like my man willard here .
and when they find it , they think it' s him .
you think it' s that easy ?
i can just take up any old body ... ... and give it to you ?
i got filing slips !
my bodies are catalogued !
this is a tight ship !
why don' t you take some old bum that nobody would notice ?
a " bum " ?
come on ! lf you do it , there' s $100, 000 for you .
will it show up on my w2 ?
no , tax free .
good .
because why should my money go to pave roads and build schools ?
yeah , good point .
listen .
this is the plan .
dump the body tomorrow night .
and make sure you get someone that looks like me , okay ?
no problem .
piece of cake .
here' s some clothes of mine that you can put on him , all right ?
and i got my driver' s license .
you put that in his pocket .
yes .
and here' s some jewelry .
jewelry ?
those are nice .
wait a minute .
lsn' t this suit kind of ratty ?
ain' t it gonna be degrading for a dead man to have to wear this trash ?
just do it .
all right .
i' il do it .
miss crock , i just want to thank you for agreeing to pay the ransom .
' cause most folks ....
most folks just don' t appreciate the work we cops do .
virginia .
what ?
willard , bring in our guests some coffee here !
what' s that ?
i don' t know .
the cover page is from pic ' n ' shop .
it' s from the kidnappers .
miss crock , bring the cash to three rivers stadium at 10 : 00 pm .
no cops or the chauffeur dies .
no cops !
what if those bums run off with my money ?
don' t worry , ma' am .
that ballpark is so gigantic ... ... we' re gonna be able to hide a million cops in there .
i thought these guys were smart , but they' re in way over their heads .
you think the cops are gonna show up at the stadium ?
you kidding me , man ?
it' s gonna be like rush hour at dunkin ' donuts .
yeah .
i' il be waiting for you in the runway lounge .
don' t forget .
the flight' s at midnight .
then , tomorrow ...
... we' il be lying on the beach .
sipping margaritas .
smoking a fatty .
this is the most distressful day of my life .
do we have to pay them all the money ?
i mean , couldn' t we , i don' t know , sort of shortchange them a little ?
virginia , bite the bullet .
i' m sure your taxman will figure a way to write it off .
that' s a lot of green .
jesus christ , i don' t know what the hell the wheel is doing on this side of the car .
god almighty , i don' t know how poor willard ever put up with this shit .
hello ?
this is the kidnapper .
how' d you get my number ?
shut up !
there' s been a change in plan .
don' t go to no stadium .
i gotta go to the stadium .
you' re not gonna do nothing until i tell you to , you smelly old bitch .
nowlisten ... ... you meet me at midtown park .
that place isn' t safe after dark !
cork it !
i' il see you there in ten minutes .
quick , get me the police !
i' m still here !
try any more games like that , i' il put a bullet through willard' s head .
gimme the money !
you' re the kidnapper .
you no good hooligan !
you decimate my house .
you violate my public goodwill !
and why ?
why me ?
what did i ever do to you ?
gimme the money !
you oughta be ashamed of yourself !
does your mother know the kind of work that you do ?
don' t you ever stop talking ?
gimme the money !

he was a strong worker !
and he had good teeth !

i' m just gonna take some work home .
i' m very conscientious .
oh , boy .
i' il go get it .
wake up !
where am l ?
what is this ?
what' s going on here ?
the police found you beat up in the park .
but , of course , those incompetents let the kidnappers get away , with my money .
so , i was in the park ... ... and they got away with the $5 million ....
you owe me .
and you' re going to work off that ransom ... ... until the day jesus calls you home .
just a chunk light in spring water , not in olive oil , and a diet coke .
there you are , as i live and breathe .
pittsburgh' s finest .
i' m truly sorry , ma' am .
but if it' s any consolation , we had every inch of that stadium covered .
we had snipers .
who cares ?
would you do me a favor ?
find my cash .
i gotta get outta here .
mr. fillmore , i ....
could i have a few words with you ?
sure , of course .
how can i help you ?
i wonder , mr. fillmore ....
i wonder if you would ...
... give me a description of the kidnappers ?
the kidnappers .
well , i never actually saw the kidnappers ... ... that well because i was kept blindfolded .
blindfolded ?
but you were not blindfolded on the video .
no , i wasn' t .
no , i wasn' t blindfolded on the video .
but i didn' t see the kidnappers then either , because ... ... they hired a tv crew to shoot the video .
yeah , we did it in a studio with a crew .
you got any nuprin ?
no .
why ?
what happened in there ?
the bozo' s covering for the kidnappers .
i really gotta get out of here .
stop !
where do you think you' re going ?
rusty !
hey , rust .
where you been ?
the drop off did not go as planned .
i concur ' cause the plan never mentioned my best friend two timing me .
i didn' t two time you !
come on , man !
i' il do the drop all by myself , that way rusty won' t get in trouble .
where' s the bag of money ?
why aren' t you at the airport ?
what are you doing in a hospital ?
a street gang took the money .
bullshit !
you' re ripping me off !
no !
i swear to god .
it was these big muscle men in the park .
they beat me up and took the $5 million .
they had guns and tattoos ... ... and they had those two sticks on a chain that you swing and you hurt people with .
are you saying you were mugged ?
mugged ?
it was more like a rape .
well , not a real rape .
look , grand lnquisitor , if you had ripped me off ... ... would you barricade yourself in a hospital room with 20 cops outside ?
you make an interesting point .
it' s not imaginable that things could be more botched .
yeah ?
what about grover ?
oh , no !
that fruitcake' s gonna be dumping my fake body .
hello , county morgue , rita speaking .
can i help you ?
i' d like to speak to a grover cleaver .
i' m sorry .
mr. cleaver no longer works here .
bitch , what are you talking about ?
mr. cleaver quit yesterday .
he said he was joining the superrich .
grover retired from the morgue .
too wealthy to hold a job .
man , we are no good at this .
we gotta stop this guy .
how ?
we don' t know where to find him .
call hillary .
she doesn' t know him .
she knew his name from that fat dude who used to live across the street .
you' re so defeatist !
fine .
i' il track him down myself .
lf you did it , you' d probably muck it up anyway .
the guy can' t do anything right .
detective !
mr. hayes .
what are you doing here ?
i' m visiting my aunt mabel .
she' s real sick .
she got polio and emphysema ... ... all that shit together .
it' s gonna kill her .
i swear .
she' s staying in this room right here .
i' m gonna go say hi .
aunt mabel , come gimme some sugar , girl .

we' ve just discovered a dead body .

they found the body !
oh , my lord .
that dumb ass grover .
he' s the only one of us who follows directions .
we' re going to jail .
we' re going to jail .
we' re gonna be somebody' s bitch .
maybe if we confess , they' il go easy on us .
yeah , maybe we' il just get community service .
or maybe they' il take us to one of those country club prisons .
we' il talk stocks with bankers .
we could really make some connections .
you' re insane .
we' re gonna be somebody' s bitch .
willard .
i have some shocking news .
they found your kidnapper .
are you sure it was the kidnapper ?
of course i' m sure !
they found his dead body on the front steps of the quaker wax museum .
he was wearing all your clothes and those divine cuff links i gave you .
any idea why the kidnapper would be wearing your clothes ?
no .
any idea why the kidnapper would be dead ?
well , that kidnapping den was a real hothouse of emotion , you know .
anything could have happened .
well , let' s just hope that body isn' t so ripped up that you can' t identify it .
that' s the guy .
no question .
that' s the kidnapper .
that' s the guy ?
that' s the guy who beat you up and held you prisoner ?
yeah , well , he was a lot more ferocious back when he was alive .
ferocious ?
he' s an old midget .
yeah , but he had a real low voice .
you know , very intimidating .
put your hands behind your head !
get in the corner .
that' s him .
that' s him !
i' d recognize that voice anywhere .
okay .
well , in some weird , screwy way that i will never understand ... ... that is the kidnapper .
i' m telling you , this whole thing stinks .
fillmore and hayes are connected .
yeah , that midget was no tough guy .
no shit , sherlock .

you deserve that money .
she' s been a figurehead for years .
oh , stop it !

what' s your connection to rusty p. hayes ?
i' ve known rusty my whole life .
our mothers were in church choir together .
i don' t even know this chauffeur guy , all right ?
the first time i seen him was in my restaurant , two weeks ago .
last night , like every week , i called up rusty ... ... and told him to come and watch monday night football .
last night was thursday .

it wasn' t monday night football .
it was oprah .
last night , i get this call to make a delivery ... ... to this wilbur guy .
you mean , willard .
yeah , right .
willard .
so anyway , i drive up to this mansion in my chicken delivery truck .
you know your truck was impounded at the airport earlier that day ?
it was ?
yeah , right .
no , i was on foot .
so anyway , the doorbell rings , and it' s the kidnappers !
so , they started chasing us .
and then miss crock , i remember she showed up .
she ran in , and she' d just been taking a bath , so she was nude .
of course , naturally , this upset everybody .
gunshots started going off , man .
the windows was exploding , i heard screaming .
so , i run to my truck as fast as i can .
i mean , i run away because i was scared .
chip oswald says you hit him over the head with a desk lamp .
no , he' s mistaken .
he' s mistaken .
that was not me .
so , rusty' s got this desk lamp and he' s beating the hell out of chip .
and , he' s pounding him and pounding him .
rusty , that' s not the kidnappers .
that' s chip !
that' s when the cops showed up and they distracted everybody ... ... and the kidnappers got away .

i am going to have your ass !
miss crock , i' m sorry .
what nerve !
after all i' ve done for you .
i was under a lot of pressure , and i ....
after all you' ve done for me ?
willard fillmore , the building is surrounded !
what exactly , miss crock , did you ever do for me ?
i' ve been your slave for 15 years !
i worked my butt off !
and then , when i got kidnapped , you wouldn' t even pay the ransom money !
well , after all , you ...
... were just a hired servant .
hired ....
well , does a hired servant watch tv with you when you' re lonely ?
does a hired servant read to you that time you broke your glasses ?
does a hired servant visit you in the hospital when nobody else does ?
i did everything my father would' ve .
not everything .
your father was , a very special man .
he provided extra services .
oh , my god .
your dad didn' t say , " stick with miss crock .
you' il get ahead .
he said , " stick with miss crock and you' il get head .
would you butt out ?
we' re talking here !
yuck !
let' s move !
can you see them ?
they' re on the third floor .
oh , man !
that' s why i couldn' t compare to my dad ?
now , don' t be silly .
it' s just that ... ... your father was very gifted .
that' s some big shoes to fill .
i don' t wanna hear this !
man , you must' ve been a total let down .
no wonder she ransomed you with an empty suitcase .
that suitcase wasn' t empty .
i paid every cent .
then why do roger and chip have the money ?
roger and chip ?
stop !
don' t shoot !
they' re stupid and confused !
position !
move out !
i' m going in .
come on !
i can' t believe it .
i can' t believe chip shafted me .
i can' t believe you came through .
beaver team , move in !
go !
it' s like an army out there .
i' m on parole for mail fraud .
i gotta hide .
how' d you get in there , man ?
i mean ...
come on , grover ! ... l ... ... took care of all of chip' s gambling debts .
i paid for all his methadone treatments .
i guess we both got the big screw .
come on , grover !
don' t move !
hayes and fillmore ... ... you' re under arrest , again , for the abduction of virginia crock .
and this time , it' s gonna stick !
you clod .
they didn' t kidnap me .
they rescued me .
lf willard hadn' t shown up , i' d be dead and buried in this hellhole !
i don' t understand .
then who' s the kidnapper ?
first , i wanna upgrade the assembly line .
toss out minced meat .
bring in vanilla custard .
then , i' m gonna mix strawberry into the rhubarb .
freeze !
you' re under arrest .
chip oswald ... ... you are under arrest for the kidnappings of willard fillmore and virginia crock .
that is ridiculous !
how dare you !
i demand you leave my house !
put on your pants .
you' re going to jail .
all right , let' s get them hands behind your back .
oh , my god !
it' s the new village people .
you' re all crazy !
put down that gun !
i' m not going back to prison !
what do you mean ...
... " back " ?
up yours !
i' ve got nothing from all of those years of suffering , working for you !
nobody does .
stay out of this !
i' il see you all in hell !
i' il slice you and i' il dice you ... ... and i' il bake you all into meat pies !
well , it' s an ugly ending , but the case is solved .
i knew he was the kidnapper the whole time .
never trust a black man named chip .
this is so beautiful .
i could spend the rest of my life here .
yeah .
and we found a place where almost everyone speaks english .
there' s my juicy , succulent chicken .
come here .
how' s business , baby ?
great , rusty .
you guys got a package .
look .
it' s from miss crock .
what did she send ?
check it out .
it' s an armani suit .
and there' s a letter .
dear willard , i hope you' re enjoying your retirement money .
here' s a suityou can wear when you graduate from u. s. c.
back in pittsburgh , i decided not to sell the company .
and i have a new man in my life .
grover' s quite special .
he' s a little slow , but he does what he' s told .
so , thanks again forintroducing us .
your everlasting friend , virginia .
