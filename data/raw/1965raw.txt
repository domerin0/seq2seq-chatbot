somebody' s coming , pa .
well ...
let him come .
hope you don' t mind my cutting through your place .
no , i guess not .
i' m heading north .
didn' t expect to find any fences around here .
hello , boy .
you were watching me , weren' t you ?
yes , i was .
i like a man who watches things goin ' around .
it means he' il make his mark some day .
long time since i' ve seen a jersey cow .
you' il see a lot more .
jerseys and holsteins ... ... and the like .
can i offer you some water ?
thanks .
you' re a little touchy .
joey !
you know not to point guns at people .
i wasn' t pointing at anybody , mother .
sure had me snortin ' , son .
i just wanted you to see my rifle .
bet you can shoot .
can' t you ?
little bit .
looks like your friends are a little late .
what are the ryker boys up to this time ?
rykers ?
that' s what i said .
i wouldn' t know a ryker from your jersey cow .
don' t forget to close the gate on your way out .
would you put down that gun ?
then i' il leave .
what' s the difference ?
you' re leaving anyway .
i' d like it to be my idea .
howdy , starrett .
expectin ' trouble ?
i don' t want no trouble , starrett .
i came to inform you .
i got that reservation beef contract .
so many to tell me that ?
i mean business .
then , tend to your own .
that' s just what i' m doin ' .
i' m gonna need all my range .
now you' ve warned me , get off my place .
your place ?
you' il have to get out before the snow .
supposin ' i don' t ?
you and the other squatters .
homesteaders , you mean .
i could blast you outta here right now .
listen to me .
the time for gun blastin ' a man off his place is passed .
they' re building a penitentiary ...
joe , that' s enough .
who are you , stranger ?
i' m a friend of starrett' s .
well , starrett , you can' t say i didn' t warn you .
all right , you' ve told me .
now get off my claim .
supper' il be ready in a little while , joe .
won' t be very long .
wait , mister , i ...
i swear , i ...
wait a minute , please .
i take that back , what i ...
look , this ... this thing ain' t even loaded .
not loaded ?
no , joey' s too young to go loaded .
that' s his gun .
if this don' t beat all !
my name is starrett , joe starrett , and this here' s joey .
you heard what my little woman said .
come on in , i feel like eatin ' .
you can call me shane .
guess i spook kinda easy these days .
hello , joe .
my place ain' t very much yet , but my wife sure can cook !
it won' t be long till supper .
you can wash up right here .
in case you wanted to know , that' s ryker' s spread all over there .
he thinks the whole world belongs to him .
the old timers can' t see it yet , but runnin ' cattle on an open range can' t go on .
it takes too much space for too little results .
those herds aren' t any good , they' re all horns and bone .
cattle that is bred for meat and fenced in and fed right , that' s the thing .
you gotta pick your spot , get your land , your own land .
a homesteader can' t run but a few beef , but he can grow grain , and then with his garden and hogs and milk , he' il be all right .
we make out , don' t we , marian ?
of course .
it' s that calf again .
joey , chase her out of there .
joey !
run on , son .
don' t forget to shut that gate .
joey !
come on , shoo !
i wouldn' t ask you where you' re bound .
one place or another .
some place i' ve never been .
the only way i' il leave is in a pine box .
what do you mean , pa ?
i mean they' il have to shoot me and carry me out .
you shouldn' t talk like that .
it' s the truth .
you love this place .
we' ve got our roots down .
i wish you wouldn' t talk that way .
our first real home .
what did you mean ... ?
joey , be quiet .
the men want to talk .
there' s just more work here than i can do .
if i could hire me a man that ...
i had one once , but the rykers roughed him up , so he lit out , cussin ' me ...
they knocked his teeth out .
ready for pie ?
if nobody else is gonna eat this biscuit , i guess i' il have to .
we' re kind of fancy , aren' t we ?
what is , pa ?
good plates , an extra fork ...
what about me , ma ?
what' s the matter , marian ?
nothing .
that was an elegant dinner , mrs starrett .
excuse me .
where' s mr shane going ?
he didn' t even say goodbye .
he' s not going , joey .
he wouldn' t go without taking that .
i' m going outside with him .
did you ask him to stay the night ?
i' il do that right now .
well , i' il be doggone .
come here a minute .
joe , why don' t you hitch up the team ?
marian , i' ve been fighting this stump off and on for two years .
use the team now , this stump could say it beat us .
sometimes nothing will do but your own sweat and muscle .
all right .
bang !
bang !
i wish they' d give me some bullets for this gun .
good morning , joey .
how did you know it was me ?
well , i figured the cow couldn' t work that latch .
why are you up so early ?
you' re to stay for breakfast .
oh ...
well , thank you .
then where will you go ?
where would you say , joey ?
i wish you' d stay here .
would you teach me to shoot ?
you' d like to learn to shoot ?
pa wishes you' d stay , too .
i heard him tell mother .
he said he didn' t want you to fight his fights for him , just help with the work .
i bet you wouldn' t leave just because it' s dangerous .
joey !
joey , come here this minute .
i hope you' il stay , mr shane .
coming , mother !
close the gate , joey .
what are you doing in your nightshirt ?
come in and put your clothes on .
would you like to hitch up the team and haul that wire from grafton' s ?
anything you say .
get off the bed .
go on !
he' s holding it for me at the store .
while you' re there , you might as well get yourself some work clothes .
what can i bring joey ?
soda pop !
you don' t need anything , joey .
be careful .
i don' t want my troubles to be none of yours .
aren' t you wearing your six shooter ?
i didn' t know there was any wild game in town , joey .
come on , son .
joey , come back here !
bang !
bang !
who are you shootin ' at ?
rykers .
bang !
did you get many ?
missed one .
well , can' t stand for that .
pa , do you guess shane will teach me to shoot ?
i' il teach you myself once i get the time , joey .
can you shoot as good as shane ?
i' ve never seen him shoot .
but i doubt it .
he didn' t wear his gun today .
why' s that , pa ?
well , he' s tradin ' at the store , not holdin ' it up .
but why , pa ?
honest , why didn' t he ?
i don' t wear one myself .
it goes with him , though .
somebody' s coming , joe .
i know .
it' s ernie wright .
could you whip him , pa ?
could you whip shane ?
can' t you ask nothing but questions ?
but could you ?
oh , maybe .
no call for that though , joey .
shane' s on our side .
howdy , joe .
how are you , ernie ?
no good .
what' s the matter ?
i' m pulling stakes .
no use of your talking .
now what' s the matter ?
my wheat .
them rykers raided it .
fence cut , steers drove in .
it' s just stubs now .
when ?
last night .
i' m leaving , and don' t try to talk me out of it .
you can' t ...
just don' t try , that' s all .
i listened to you too much already .
go ahead , nobody' s holding you .
you wouldn' t leave your home and land , and ...
oh , ernie , you ...
i' m wore down and out .
tired of being insulted by them fellas .
called a pig farmer .
who knows what comes next ?
well , don' t throw your tail up .
tell you what , we' il all get together here tonight and figure out something .
i don' t know about me .
i' il get the word around .
you tell shipstead and torrey .
all right , but if we' re having a meeting , it' d better be more than pokin ' holes in the air with your finger .
anything i can do you for ?
i came to get wire for joe starrett .
i' ve been holding wire for starrett for quite a spell .
are you new ?
yes , i' m working for starrett .
got ready made pants to fit me ?
farm rig ?
i outfit all these farmers .

hey , will .

young man , you owe me two dollars and two bits .
what' s the matter , son ?
you look kinda pale .

money don' t go very far these days .
a new sodbuster ?
thought i smelled pigs .
anything else ?
got any soda pop ?
i sure do .
i wish more men around here would drink it .
in my bar , in there .
thanks .
will !
let' s keep the smell of pigs out from where we' re drinking .
bartender .
what can i do for you ?
do you have any soda pop ?
are you gonna get him out or do i have to ?
let me take him , chris .
what' il it be ?
lemon , strawberry or lilac , sodbuster ?
you speaking to me ?
i don' t see nobody else standing there .
here , have some of this .
smell like a man .
don' t it smell better in here , grafton ?
chris just fumigated a sodbuster .
just take it easy .
i was just asking about sody pop , pigs and taters and one thing and another .
which one of them tater pickers are you working for ?
or are you just squatting on the range ?
joe starrett , if it' s any of your business .
supposing i make it my business ?
here' s your soda pop , mister .
now you and your soda pop get outta here and stay outta here .
and don' t come back !
did you see that , rufe ?
chris just put the run on a sodbuster .
that' s it .
keep ' em on the move .
warm it up for you ?
it' s getting so i don' t like to ride at night .
let' s hope the meeting starts ...
is shane going to be at the meeting ?
mr shane .
yes , i suppose so .
we all know why we' re here .
ryker' s war party' s been around to see all of us .
i' m here to tell you , i ain' t leavin ' now or any other time .
start with you , axel .
what do you say ?
well , joe , you see ...
i know what i want to say .
start with me .
ernie , we' re gonna hear everybody in turn .
go ahead .
most of you don' t know shane .
shane , this is yank potts .
howdy .
fred lewis here .
i seen you in town .
ernie wright here , and ed howells .
and johnson .
howdy , shane .
see anybody else coming ?
no .
we' re waiting for torrey .
how far is ryker gonna push us ?
let' s not talk scared , that' s what ryker wants .
he thinks he can shoo us off like a flock of chickens .
here' s torrey .
hello , reb .
hello , yank .
about time you showed up .
that' s enough out of you , yank .
and you , too .
all right .
cool off , stonewall .
shake hands with shane , there .
shane' s working for me .
shane .
oh , yeah ...
i heard about you , at grafton' s .
go on , joe .
well , stonewall , it' s like this ...
leaving ernie out , maybe , we' ve all agreed we' re gonna stick .
now you' re whistling .
ain' t nobody pushing me off my claim .
i think you all know that i' m staying .
i , too , will stay .
i' il string along , leastways till the shooting starts .
there ain' t but seven of us , if it comes to a fight .
him .
that' s eight .
can' t count on him .
he' s proved that much .
watch what you' re saying .
shane can tell you what happened with ryker' s man , chris .
they' re talking about shane !
what is this , shane ?
let him say .
lewis seen and heard it .
he let chris buffalo him at grafton' s .
fred , i told shane to stay away from trouble .
let' s finish the story .
he didn' t .
shane didn' t let him do that !
this chris went around bragging he put the run on a sodbuster .
shane , you don' t have to leave .
i figured you could talk freer if i weren' t around .
it' s too late to finish this now .
he didn' t , did he ?
joey , i want you to go to sleep .
it' s all right , everything' s all right .
shane isn' t going away ?
no , he isn' t .
now , get back into bed .
stay there .
shane .
shane !
i know you ain' t afraid .
it' s a long story , joey .
i think we know ... ... shane .
don' t stand in the rain .
you' il catch your death of cold !
so , on saturday , we' il get together and go into town for our supplies .
that' s a good idea .
there' s some strength in a whole bunch .
i don' t need no bodyguard .
i' il put on my . 38 and go when i please .
joey .
yes ?
don' t get to liking shane too much .
why not ?
i don' t want you to .
is there anything wrong with him ?
no .
then what , mother ?
he' il be moving on one day , joey .
you' il be upset , if you get to liking him too much .
marian , you' re pretty enough , come on !
i' m coming !
i wish she' d hurry so we could get going .
i don' t like this business .
get in the wagon , son .
one thing a married man has to get used to is waiting for women .
hurry up , ma !
here she comes .
good afternoon .
hello .
sometimes the waiting is worth it .
take care and get a woman worth waiting for .
water' s good .
think i can get ready as quickly as you ?
hold your horses , we wanted to see how pretty you were .
come on here .
all set ?
come on , girls !
hello !
morning .
are you all set ?
reckon we are .
hello , marian !
where' s stonewall ?
he got thirsty and went on in .
said he had business that couldn' t wait .
i got to stay and mind the girls .
bye !
bye !
come on , red .
bye , marian !
stonewall , what are you doing ?
we agreed to come together .
i had a little business to attend to .
we can' t buy a drink .
get down off that horse .
you' re acting like a darn fool .
a whole bunch came in .
they brought their women to protect them .
my jars come yet ?
howdy , starrett .
what can i do you for ?
my , my , my ... !
what will they think of next ?
susan !
did you bring your mother' s list ?
yes , pa .
get the coal oil can from the wagon .
my woman want we get together on the fourth of july .
we make big celebration , don' t we , marian ?
fine , that' s just what we need .
it' s joe starrett' s anniversary , the fourth of july .
we' il have a big party .
mr grafton ...
have you got gunpowder for the fireworks ?
how about some of those jellies ... ?
we' il talk about that later .
what do i get for the empty ?
the usual .
thank you .
give the bottle to will .
i need some white flour , mr grafton , and four pounds of coffee .
joey .
let me take it in .
you come , too , shane .
thank you .
well , now look here what we got .
that' s one of the new ones .
they call him sody pop .
deal me out .
what' s the matter , pete ?
just say i' m superstitious , that' s all .
i guess you don' t hear very well , sodbuster .
i told you , if you want to keep healthy , stay out of here .
now , get going .
look , pig farmer .
get back with the women and kids , where it' s safe .
don' t push it , calloway .
did you hear me ?
i said get going .
did you think you were gonna come and drink with the men ?
set ' em up , bartender .
two whiskies .
you bought me a drink last time i was in here .
now i want to buy you one .
you ain' t gonna drink that in here .
you guessed it .
let me have him .
let him go .
let me have him .
go get him , chris .
tear him apart !
get that sodbuster .
hang one on him , chris .
bust him .
break his back .
this is bad , this is bad .
i' m going in there .
no , stonewall , stay right here .
if we join in , we' il get run out .
go on !
go get him , chris .
there ain' t a marshal within a hundred mile ride .
get after him , chris .
plough him under , chris .
beat his brains out !
get him !
land that right , chris .
knock him into that pigpen , chris !
dirty pig farmer !
stop this !
go on , get at it .
here , men , stop this !
settle it outside .
looks like it' s all over .
we should get out of here .
maybe you' d like to draw straws .
hold on , young fella .
you may have a friend you don' t know you' ve got .
i could use a man like you .
i' m working for starrett .
you don' t belong on the end of a shovel .
anything to stop you drawin ' your time ?
i like working for starrett .
whatever he' s paying , i' il double .
it' s no use .
what are you looking for ?
nothing .
pretty wife , starrett' s got .
you dirty old man !
people don' t talk to me that way .
i' m talking that way .
you had a chance .
nobody messes up my boys and gets away with it .
we' il ride you out of this valley .
gonna rough you up and ride you out and you' re gonna stay out .
shane , come on !
joey , get out of here .
but , shane , there' s too many .
you wouldn' t want me to run away , would you ?
but there' s too many , shane .
go on , son , please .
stop !
i' il pay the damages .
no more fighting .
keep outta this .
this man' s unarmed .
it ain' t a shooting .
quit butting in .
i' il take him .
stop it , men !
stop fighting !
stop it , men .
stop this !
break his neck !
where' s joey ?
pa , they' re going to kill shane !
they' re trying to kill him !
stay with your mother .
don' t go in .
shane' s in there .
what ryker' s got coming ain' t fit for a woman to see .
don' t go in there , joe ...
beat his brains in !
stop it !
stop it !
stop it !
you fools have had enough of it .
you' il all get killed .
starrett , you and shane back on out of here .
that' s making some sense , starrett .
you' ve won .
get out of here .
ryker ain' t paying for this damage .
i' m paying for what' s broke .
no , by godfrey , we' re paying for what' s broke , me and shane !
morgan , put one of the boys on a good horse .
he' s got a long trip , all the way to cheyenne .
i' m through fooling , grafton .
from now on , when we fight with them , the air' s gonna be full of gunsmoke .
i saw it all , mother , every bit .
it' s no place for you , joey .
no place for you either , marian .
i was scared .
then pa picked up that man and slung him on the floor .
i didn' t do much .
it was all shane .
how are you feeling ?
better .
you did , joe .
it was ugly and you were both wonderful .
when that chair came down on you , shane , i thought you were a goner .
it was an easy chair , joey .
i bet you two could lick anyone .
well , one thing' s for sure , ryker' s gonna think twice .
don' t talk about ryker any more now .
i wish we could forget him .
this turpentine' il hurt .
he wouldn' t say nothing .
no matter how much it hurt .
would you , shane ?
i' m afraid i would , joey , if it hurt bad enough .
it stings like anything .
joey , go on to bed .
it does smart , i know .
ouch !
gosh !
joey , for the last time , go to bed .
yeah , me , too .
come on , son .
will you kiss me goodnight , mother ?
all right .
your head ...
your head needs a bandage .
it' s good enough , marian , it' s fine .
thanks very much .
you wanna know something , mother ?
what is it ?
what is it , joey ?
mother ...
i just love shane .
do you ?
i love him almost as much as i love pa .
that' s all right , isn' t it ?
he' s a fine man .
he' s so good .
don' t you like him , mother ?
yes , i like him , too , joey .
goodnight , joey .
what' s the matter , honey ?
joe ...
hold me .
don' t say anything .
just hold me tight .
' night , ma !
goodnight , joey .
' night , pa !
' night , son .
' night , shane !
where' s ryker ?
he' s getting a little sleep .
he sent for me .
sit down for a minute .
we' re having a celebration today .
where' s the coffee ?
i' il put it right on .
what' s going on here ?
plenty .
going somewhere ?
looks that way , don' t it ?
don' t let ' em bluff you , ernie .
bluff , huh ?
see that ?
they killed my sow last night .
kept shooting and yelling what they' d do next .
woke up the kids and scared the missus half to death .
we' re gonna put a stop to that .
i said i' d stay for one more hand .
well , this is it .
i had enough of ryker .
here they come again !
right through my ploughed ground .
what do you think of that , stonewall torrey ?
starrett and the rest of us are gonna take the juice out of ' em , one of these days .
anyhow , i' m going to grafton' s to get a bottle .
show ' em it' s independence day .
ma , you getting ready ?
good luck .
good luck for you , too , stonewall .
can' t see a pig in sight !
i don' t see none , but i sure can smell ' em .
they cut mr wright' s fence and mr shipstead' s , too .
they did ?
shane , what would you do if you caught them cutting our fence ?
i' d ask them to please go around by the gate .
oh , shane !
come on , i' il race you to the barn .
it' s a go !
why don' t you ever wear your six shooter , shane ?
i guess i don' t see as many bad men as you do .
shane .
you want me to tell you something ?
if you want to .
i saw your gun in there , one day .
i took a look at it .
oh ?
are you mad ?
no , i guess not .
but if i were you , i' d leave a thing like this alone .
i wrapped it up in the blanket again .
that' s a good boy .
could i see it again ?
you promised you' d show me how to shoot .
please !
all right , joey .
come on .
get ' em up !
we' ve got some learning to do !
come on .
you stand right here .
all right , put your arms down to your side .
your holster' s too low .
never have your holster at arm' s length .
let' s fix this .
you always have it here , with the grip between the elbow and the wrist .
so when your hand comes up , the gun clears the holster without coming up too high , see ?
now you try it , real fast and straight .
that' s it .
gosh !
is that what real gunfighters do ?
no , joey .
most of them have tricks of their own .
one , for instance , likes a shoulder holster .
another one puts it in the belt of his pants .
and some like two guns .
but one' s all you need if you can use it ... ... after 15 paces .
no good for putting a bullet where you want it .
which is the best way ?
what i' m telling you is as good as any , better than most .
let me see you shoot .
what do you want me to shoot at ?
the little white rock over there , see ?
gosh , almighty , that is good !
you see , joey ?
now look .
remember .
when your hand comes up , you still clear your holster .
shane .
hello , mrs starrett .
i was teaching joey a little shooting .
i don' t want ...
you ought to see shane shoot .
he' s teaching me .
yes , i know .
get ready for the party .
oh , ma !
guns aren' t going to be my boy' s life .
why do you always have to spoil everything ?
a gun is a tool , no better or worse than any other tool , an axe , a shovel , or anything .
a gun is as good or as bad as the man using it .
remember that .
we' d all be better off if there wasn' t a single gun in this valley , including yours .
what' s all the shooting about ?
you' re starting the celebrating a little early , aren' t you ?
well , look at that woman , in her wedding dress !
shane , you better hitch up that team ,
' cause today we' re really gonna celebrate the fourth of july !
i' m supposed to say to the squatters , " i' m busted but you' re welcome .
it ain' t that bad .
that' s easy for you to say .
i' ve been your friend a long time , i' m reasonable .
but something' s got to give .
out here a man can go just so far .
i' ve gone along with the new law .
i' ve stayed away from gunfighting .
sure , i' ve tried to buffalo the sodbusters .
you got to admit , my men have kept their six guns cased .
and now ?
i can guess what' s on your mind .
keep your guesses to yourself .
i like joe starrett .
fool oughta listen to reason .
your reason ?
what' s the matter with you ?
no offence , rufe .
it' s your own conscience eating on you .
conscience !
hello , torrey .
something i can do you for ?
a jug .
it' s the fourth .
come in , come in .
jug .
and a whiskey .
here' s to you , ryker , for running ernie wright off his claim .
another .
is that one of them ?
yeah .
it' s a downright dirty shame .
it' s all he had and he worked hard for it .
i want to tell you something , ryker .
he' s running because he' s a coward .
and here' s to me , ' cause i ain' t a coward and you ain' t getting my claim .
they' re hot headed .
you' d get him to draw without any trouble .
it' d be easy .
you can' t scare me any more than you can joe starrett .
no .
it' s starrett we want .
three cheers for wyoming !
the rest of you care to join me ?
drink a toast to the greatest state in the union ?
i' m from wyoming .
here' s to the independence of the sovereign state of alabama .
there you are .
i' m through with all you yanks .
listen , you yankees ... !
hello , axel .
you' re late , reb , we took richmond two hours ago !
everybody , come here ...
marian !
you come too , i have something important to tell you .
axel ...
ja , mama .
now ...
you all know what today is .
it' s independence day .
except for one man here .
yes , sir .
this was the day joe starrett got himself hooked , by golly !
well , no ...
what i' d like to say is ...
well , say it , joe !
i' d like to say that axel' s right .
what did he say , joe ?
i gave up my independence 10 years ago today .
but no man ever gave it up as easy as i did .
and what' s more , i wouldn' t trade places with any man in this world .
good speech !
go on , joe , give her a kiss .
come here !
congratulations .
pass the word to the boys , i got some cheer for us .
many more , joe !
we were ready to give you up , you and ernie .
ernie' s getting out today .
packed up kit and caboodle .
been expecting that .
ryker' s boys bluffed him out .
maybe he had sense .
what were you doing in town ?
joe , i want to dance .
marian , they' ve fenced me out here .
joe don' t want you in town by yourself .
it' s just ryker and grafton gabbing .
grafton' s ok .
another man was there , likely hired by ryker .
who was that ?
stranger , decked out like a gunfighter .
did you say " guns " ?
yeah , two guns .
what did he look like ?
packs two guns , kinda lean ...
he wears a black hat .
is he a friend of yours ?
no .
a man named wilson looks like that , a gunfighter .
jack wilson ?
gunfighter outta cheyenne .
can' t be him , can it ?
i didn' t ask him his name .
what about him ?
what' s a gunman doing around here ?
pow wow with ryker ?
don' t start .
we don' t know it' s wilson .
this wilson , would you know him , shane ?
if you saw him ?
maybe .
if it is wilson , he' s fast on the draw , so be careful .
you seem to know a lot about this kind of business , shane .
that is enough .
come and eat before things get cold .
i don' t want no part of gunslinging .
murder' s a better name .
we eat now , everyone .
you fellas get the shoe game !
torrey , i want to go to the blacksmith' s , but joe says we shouldn' t go alone .
any time you wanna go to town , i' il ride along with you .
i' m a soldier who' s done fighting in real battles .
i can shoot just as straight ...
shane ...
yes , joey ?
think that was him ?
who ?
that man torrey seen in town .
do you think that was wilson ?
don' t worry about things like that .
rest , joey .
it' s past your bedtime .
yes , mother .
no , joey .
i' il open it .
all right .
all right .
i' il open the gate for you .
who goes there ?
brother rufe' s come to pay you a little visit .
howdy , starrett .
evening , ma' am .
i had somethin ' i wanted to talk over with you .
whatever business we got , we can talk over right here .
i' il just lay it on the barrelhead , then .
how' d you like to work for me ?
i work for myself .
done enough working for others .
wait till i tell you .
i' il pay you top wages .
more than you make on this patch of ground .
no , i' m not interested .
i haven' t said it all .
you can run your cattle with mine .
what' s more , i' il buy your homestead .
set a price you think is reasonable , you' il find me reasonable .
is that fair ?
you' ve made things hard for us , and we' re in the right .
right ?
you in the right ?
when i came to this country , you weren' t much older than your boy .
we had rough times .
me and other men that are mostly dead now .
i got a bad shoulder yet from a cheyenne arrowhead .
we made this country , we found it and we made it , with blood and empty bellies .
cattle we brought in were hazed off by indians and rustlers .
they don' t bother you much any more because we handled ' em .
we made a safe range out of this .
some of us died doing it , but we made it .
then people move in who never had to raw hide it through the old days .
they fence off my range and fence me off from water .
some of them plough ditches , take out irrigation water .
so the creek runs dry sometimes and i gotta move my stock because of it .
and you say we have no right to the range .
the men that did the work and ran the risks have no rights ?
i take you for a fair man , starrett .
i' m not belittling what you did , but you didn' t find this country .
there were trappers here and indian traders before you .
they tamed this country .
they weren' t ranchers .
rights !
you think you' ve the right to say nobody else has got any .
that ain' t the way the government looks at it .
i didn' t come to argue .
i made you a fair proposition .
what about the others ?
shane knows he can work for me .
the other homesteaders ?
look , be reasonable !
after all , there' s just so many hands in a deck of cards .
then , i' ve got to say no .
you don' t give a man much choice .
how do you feel about it , son ?
would you like to go partners with me ?
i don' t want trouble with your father .
we don' t want anyone to get hurt .
joey ain' t quite of age , ryker .
how about it , son ?
come here , joey .
i don' t want you to be sorry , starrett .
i' il see you .
what do you make of him ?
he' s no cow puncher .
no .
he doesn' t look the part .
i like starrett , too , but i' il kill him if i have to .
i' il kill him if i have to .
you mean i' il kill him if you have to .
i can' t have any run in with the law .
you heard grafton .
just get starrett in here .
it wouldn' t take much to bait him .
well , look here .
look here .
why don' t we just gun him and get on with it ?
one' s run already .
it won' t take much to stampede the rest .
remember , wilson , you got to make this look right to grafton .
hey , come here !
torrey ...
i wouldn' t go over there , torrey .
nobody' s gonna buffalo me .
what can i do for you ?
where do you think you' re going ?
to get a whiskey .
torrey .
torrey .
torrey .
they tell me they call you " stonewall " .
anything wrong with that ?
it' s just funny .
i guess they named a lot of that ... ... southern trash after old stonewall .
who' d they name you after ?
or would you know ?
i' m saying that " stonewall " jackson was trash himself .
him and lee , and all the rest of them rebs .
you , too .
you' re a low down , lying yankee .
prove it .
no , torrey !
one less sodbuster .
what ?
he tried to pull on wilson .
ain' t that right , swede ?
he tried to reach for a ...
all right .
get him outta here .
tell your friends we' il be waiting for any more that come in looking for trouble .
you understand that , swede ?
now get him outta here .
what happened ?
the sodbuster tried to kill wilson .
what' s the shooting ?
sodbuster tried to pull on wilson .
lewis !
lewis !
pa !
what' s happened ?
lewis !
fred !
fred !
torrey , he is dead !
ryker did it !
i' il go get starrett .
shane , we sure enough earned our keep today .
if they just leave us alone , we' il make a farm out of this yet .
somebody' s coming , pa .
looks like shipstead .
it' s mr shipstead .
starrett !
torrey , he is dead !
torrey ?
torrey , he is dead !
the new man shot him , the new man that works for ryker did it .
i was across the street , i heard anger in the voices .
the two of them reach for pistols , but the new man is quick , terribly quick .
one shot , torrey dead .
one shot .
what happened ?
we go to town together .
he say it be safe .
it was all quiet .
we separate .
then the anger in the voices , i hear .
only the anger , not the words .
ryker' s men were all around .
what started it ?
i passed lewis , his missus and johnson .
they' re scared .
who saw it ?
just the ryker men and me .
morgan say they wait for any more who come looking for trouble .
marian , you get ready .
mrs torrey will need you .
shane , hitch up the team .
what are you going to do , joe ?
go to town .
i' m gonna see about this .
you can' t go alone .
marian , i' m going .
she' s right , joe .
but the others are all in this , it' s not just you .
wait for them .
sooner or later , someone' s got to go .
but not now .
don' t you go alone !
the other homesteaders , i think they run .
i think they get out of here .
here comes joe starrett .
wish he' d tend to his own business .
what goes on ?
we' re going on .
i' ve had enough .
i sure figured you for a better man .
you saw what' s happened .
torrey' s dead .
just gonna pile up your plunder and skip .
too scared to see torrey get a decent funeral .
i don' t want him killed .
we' re going .
it ain' t a question of who stays or who runs .
we gotta see stonewall get a christian burial , and his wife hear some words of comfort said over her man .
we' il make sure it' s done .
torrey' s already dead .
i don' t want it to happen to my man .
fred , if you ain' t at that funeral , i' il sure take it bad of you .
well ... cemetery hill' s on the way out , martha ...
shipstead , would you please lead us in the lord' s prayer ?
our father who art in heaven , hallowed be thy name .
thy kingdom come , thy will be done on earth , as it is in heaven .
give us this day our daily bread , and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us .
and lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil .
for thine is the kingdom , and the power , and the glory , for ever .
amen .
he' s gonna bite you !
goodbye , mrs starrett , we' re going .
goodbye , joe .
goodbye , axel .
goodbye , john .
sue , you put the kids in the wagon .
wait for me , lewis .
i' m coming with you .
wait a minute , let' s not be in a hurry .
there' s one more thing .
torrey was a pretty brave man .
we' d be doing wrong if we wasn' t the same .
last time you argued that , torrey was alive .
you want us to stay for more of this ?
we can have a regular settlement .
we can have a town , and churches and a school ...
graveyards ...
you' ve just got to , that' s all .
he wants you to stay for something that means more than anything .
your families .
your wives and kids .
like you , lewis , your girls ... ... and shipstead with his boys .
they' ve got a right to stay here and grow up and be happy .
it' s up to you people to have nerve enough to not give it up .
that' s right .
we can' t give up this valley and we ain' t gonna do it .
this is farming country , a place for people to bring up their families .
who' s ryker to run us away from our own homes ?
he only wants to grow beef , and we want to grow families , to grow them good and strong , the way they were meant to be grown .
god didn' t make all this country just for one man like ryker .
he' s got it though , and that' s what counts .
look , look there .
a fire !
it' s lewis' s place .
it' s our place .
ryker lit it .
he had no right .
he wouldn' t have , if you hadn' t left it .
i built it with my own hands .
not the girls ' room .
i was getting round to it .
if we stick together , we can put that place back up .
can' t we ?
right .
we' il help you build the room , johnson and joe .
shane' il help .
yeah .
we' il get the timber and put it right back up , right ?
yes , sir !
we' il do it .
me , too , i' il help .
you' il do that for us ?
all that , just for us ?
not just for you , martha , for all of us in this valley .
come and help .
maybe we can save part of that .
that' s the spirit .
let' s get to the lewises ' place .
come on , men !
boss !
looks like lewis is going back .
starrett' s holding ' em together .
he could set fire to mine .
stay on your ground .
he' il do us like he did torrey .
there' s a law against killing .
the law is three days ' ride from here .
you know that .
what does that leave us with ?
give me time .
who' s gonna fight ryker ?
he knows he' s got us on the run .
you men hang on ...
hang on ?
i promise something' s gonna be done .
but what , joe ?
leave that to me .
i' il have it out with ryker .
you' re taking on too much .
if i have to kill him .
that' s wrong .
don' t even think that .
starrett' s got to go .
i' ve warned him twice , but he' s pig headed .
he' il have to pay for it .
joe , you can' t do it !
if the lewises have the courage to start over , i won' t let them down .
but you can' t go in town to kill ryker .
he' il kill you .
tell him i' m a reasonable man , things have gone far enough .
tell him i' m beat , anything , but , by jupiter , get him here !
he' il come .
he thinks he' s a reasonable man .
hello , calloway .
he' il kill you .
it' s a chance i gotta take .
this is a false square knot , joey , it won' t hold .
shane !
tell him he can' t go .
tell him it won' t work .
tell him !
shane !
wait , joe , till things cool off .
wait that long , anyway .
that' s right , isn' t it , shane ?
i can' t tell joe what' s right , marian .
please wait , joe .
won' t you do even this for me ?
starrett ?
mr starrett !
who is it ?
peace party , from ryker .
one of you can come across and talk .
stay out of that garden .
we ain' t armed .
brother rufe wants to see you .
he says to tell you he' s a reasonable man .
he' s responsible for torrey' s killing .
my brother wouldn' t kill anybody .
he don' t wanna go to jail .
torrey was a hot head , he picked on a stranger .
torrey didn' t wanna be reasonable .
you wanna be reasonable , don' t you ?
i always figured on being reasonable .
my brother' s waiting .
he' il see you at grafton' s .
who else ?
not us .
we' re heading home .
i' il see your brother .
shane !
shane .
who is it ?
calloway .
chris calloway .
stay where you are .
i can drill you .
hold it , i got something to tell you .
what do you want ?
starrett' s up against a stacked deck .
bang !
bang !
bang !
bang !
why are you telling me ?
i reckon something' s come over me .
i don' t figure .
i' m quitting ryker .
so long .
chris ...
thanks .
be seeing you .
no use to argue , marian .
i' m going into this with my eyes open .
no !
isn' t there anything i can say to change things ?
maybe this is a chance .
morgan and them boys went home ...
you don' t really believe that , that' s not the reason .
it' s just too much for me to give up , this place and our valley ...
all the things that will be .
will be !
bang !
bang , bang , bang !
joey , don' t point that thing !
go play outside .
play outside , joey !
please , dear .
go outside and play .
it' s just pride , that' s all , a silly kind of a pride .
don' t i mean anything to you , joe ?
doesn' t joey ?
marian ...
honey , it' s because you mean so much to me that i' ve got to go .
could i go on living with you , and you thinking i' d showed yellow ?
and what about joey ?
how would i explain that to him ?
oh , joe ...
joe !
i' ve been thinking a lot , and ... ... i know i' m kinda slow sometimes , but i see things ...
and i know if anything happened to me that you' d be took care of .
you' d be took care of , better than i could do it myself .
i never thought i' d live to hear myself say that , but ...
i guess now' s a pretty good time to lay things bare .
you talk as though i' d be glad for you to go .
honey , you' re the most honest and the finest girl that ever lived .
i couldn' t do what i gotta do if i hadn' t always known i could trust you .
now , don' t you go counting me out !
i wouldn' t have lived this long if i wasn' t pretty tough .
pa !
shane' s got his gun on .
he' s coming !
gun ?
what' s the idea ?
don' t let him go .
don' t anybody go !
this is my kind of game .
but it ain' t yours .
maybe you' re a match for ryker , maybe not , but you' re no match for wilson .
then , i' il outlast him .
but i do appreciate it , shane .
you' re both out of your senses .
this isn' t worth a life .
are you fighting for this shack , this ground and nothing but work ?
i' m sick of it , i' m sick of trouble .
let' s move , let' s go on , please !
marian , don' t say that !
you love this place more than me .
not any more .
even if it' s true , it changes nothing .
there must be some way , shane ?
some way ?
it' s no use , joe .
no use ?
what' s stopping me ?
i am .
get out of my way .
am i gonna have to fight you , too ?
that depends on you .
stop !
stop !
shane !
you hit him with your gun !
i hate you !
walk him around when he comes to .
joey , bring water and a towel .
here , marian .
hide this .
he' il be all right .
no one can blame him for not keeping that date .
shane ...
wait !
you were through with gunfighting .
i changed my mind .
are you doing this just for me ?
for you , marian ... ... and joe and little joe .
then we' il never see you again ?
never' s a long time , marian .
tell him ...
tell him i was sorry .
no need to tell him that .
please , shane ...
mother ...
please ...
take care of yourself .
mother !
pa' s coming along all right .
yes , joey .
why did shane ... ?
shane did what he had to do .
you don' t hate shane .
i know , mother .
shane ... !
i' m sorry !
he didn' t hear you .
shane !
shane !
i' m sorry !
i came to get your offer , ryker .
i' m not dealing with you .
where' s starrett ?
you' re dealing with me , ryker .
i got no quarrel with you , shane .
you can walk out now and no hard feeling .
what' s your offer , ryker ?
to you , not a thing .
that' s too bad .
too bad .
you' ve lived too long .
your kind of days are over .
my days ?
and yours , gunfighter ?
the difference is i know it .
so we' il turn in our six guns to the bartender , and we' il all start hoeing spuds , is that it ?
not quite yet .
we haven' t heard from your friend here .
i wouldn' t push too far if i were you .
our fight ain' t with you .
it ain' t with me , wilson ?
no , it ain' t , shane .
i wouldn' t pull on wilson , shane .
will , you' re a witness to this .
so you' re jack wilson .
what' s that mean to you , shane ?
i' ve heard about you .
what have you heard , shane ?
i' ve heard that you' re a low down , yankee liar .
prove it !
shane , look out !
shane !
i knew you could , shane .
i knew it just as well as anything .
was that him ?
was that wilson ?
that was him .
that was wilson , all right .
he was fast , fast on the draw .
joey , what are you doing here ?
i' m sorry , shane .
you don' t have to be .
you' d better run back .
can' t i ride home behind you ?
i' m afraid not , joey .
please !
why not ?
i gotta be going on .
why , shane ?
a man has to be what he is , joey .
can' t break the mould .
i tried it and it didn' t work for me .
we want you , shane .
joey , there' s no living with a killing .
there' s no going back from one .
right or wrong , it' s a brand .
a brand sticks .
there' s no going back .
now you run on home to your mother , and tell her ... ... tell her everything' s all right and there aren' t any more guns in the valley .
shane ...
it' s bloody !
you' re hurt !
i' m all right , joey .
go home to your mother and father and grow up to be strong and straight .
and , joey ...
take care of them , both of them .
yes , shane .
he' d never have shot you if you' d seen him !
bye , little joe .
he' d never even have cleared the holster , would he , shane ?
pa' s got things for you to do !
and mother wants you !
i know she does !
shane !
shane !
come back !
