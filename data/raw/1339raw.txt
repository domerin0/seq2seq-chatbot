i' m sorry .

he' s in trouble .
i think he might' ve killed somebody .
you know this or you just think it ?
i' m pretty sure .
i know a very good lawyer .
he was with the d. a.

i' m gonna give him a call .
so let me get this straight .
you walk out 1 4 years ago and now you come back giving orders .
our son is in trouble .
we don' t have a son .
i do .
nothing here belongs to you .
learn a new song to sing .
you walked out on joey .
not on him .
i walked out on you .
what' s the difference ?
i' m trying to help .
you came here to arrest your own son .
lf he' s responsible .
he' il have to face up to it .
that' s funny .
you , talking about facing responsibilities .
you ran away .
anything got too close , you ran to your job .
tell him he' s better off turning himself in to me .
you think i trust you to bring him in ?
you wife beater !
you have to bring that up .
you had as much to do with it as i did .
there was never violence in my family .
not like the lamarcas !
you can' t save him by saying it runs in the family .
he made a choice to be there and kill .
like you made a choice to be a bitch .
okay , vince , you got it off your chest .
nothing more to say now ?
so go .
just tell him he' s better off turning himself in to me .
hey , where you been ?
i thought you got shot or something .
i' m sorry , i should' ve called .
are you all right ?
rough day .
ls something wrong ?
i' m just tired .
i just don' t feel like
i just don' t feel like talking .

chief .
close the door .
this is commissioner johnson and vanessa hansen from the mayor' s office .
actually , deputy assistant mayor .
take a seat , vince .
we wanted to meet you , see how to spin this for the media .
spin what ?
they know about your old man , vince .
we need a story on how the son of an executed child murderer was ...
... promoted to homicide detective .
one of the best .
the best .
of new york' s finest .
my father didn' t kill the kid .
it was a stupid accident .
yes , but the 1 1 : 00 news will be all over this .
we want to be ready .
they' il want to know how you got started .
i didn' t kill the kid .
but you were hired by police captain mcauley , your father in law ...
... who shepherded you into homicide .
what about him ?
he arrested my father and he took a big , big chance with me .
i know .
i' m just saying that this is how the media will frame it .
after the execution , i had nothing .
that cop saved me , taught me everything .
he was the kindest guy i ever met .
make that part of your story .
detective lamarca is in no way responsible .
he' s had a long and honorable career despite his father' s violent past
he wasn' t violent .
what is this ? " and that of his son .
excuse us .
" he has fought criminals ....
something like that ?
yeah , that would work .
i have to take you off the case .
i should reassign you too , reg .
i want him on it .
it' s your call .
i don' t know .
i want joey brought in safe .
i know you' il do that .
okay , all right .
rossi !
you' re working with reg on this .

i don' t need a week off , sir .
this isn' t a democracy .
i' il take you home .
put my ex wife' s place under surveillance .
a wiretap too .
he may have killed a guy .
it' s easier the second time .
you know that .
whatever you have to do , you' il always have my respect and friendship .
i' il do everything to bring him in safe .
you want company ?
how come you' re not at work ?
took a few days off .
i' m not used to seeing you in the daylight .
i look different ?
i' m sorry about yesterday .
i' m sorry i didn' t call you .
well , we' re not in high school , right ?
i just had a tough day , you know ?
no , actually , i don' t know .
i just don' t like talking about work , that' s all .
okay .
you got your place , i got mine .
no complications , and that' s okay .
i' m 43 years old , i like to keep it simple .
i don' t want to marry you .
i just want to know you .
i think i know you , then something happens ... ... and i realize i don' t know you at all .
you gonna say anything ?
what' s there to say ?
it' s my problem , not yours .
why make it yours ?
you see ?
that' s exactly what i mean .
what' s up ?
i got something for you .
how much you looking for ?
at least a grand .
i need some traveling money .
where you going ?

who are you ?
i' m gina .
okay , come on in , gina .
sit down .
you want something to drink ?
no .
so where' s joey ?
i don' t know .
you don' t know ?
when was the last time you saw him ?
i got something that belongs to joey .
i was thinking i' d leave it here with you .
it' s just stuff joey saved .
kind of like a scrapbook , you know ?
how did you know to come here ?
joey brought me once .
one day he said he wanted to see you .
and where was l ?
i don' t know .
he chickened out .
wouldn' t even push the doorbell .
just like joey .
he wouldn' t let me either .
how do you get in touch with him ?
i told you .
i don' t know where he is .
keep asking questions like that , you' il have to read me my rights .
you live in long beach ?
yeah .
i borrowed a friend' s car to get here .
i gotta get it back .
you drove into the city just to give me this ?
joe' s gone .
that stuff was real important to him .
i didn' t know what else to do with it , and his mother don' t like me , so ....
so , what do you expect me to do ?
just , like , be his dad , you know ?
i gotta go .
i' m gonna get a ticket .
gina ?
thank you .
sure .
i' il talk to you later , okay ?
cheesecake ?
that you ?
that' s me .
mom , dad ?
connie .
his name was angelo .
he' s handsome .
my old man was executed at sing sing in ' 59 ... ... for murder .
i was 8 .
what happened ?
he was a moving man .
moved rich people into mansions out in locust valley .
somehow he got himself into debt .
i guess it was bad .
he had this idea to fix it .
kidnap a baby from a rich family .
leave a ransom note .
they' il pay , no sweat .
he kidnaps the baby .
while he' s waiting for the ransom in his car ... ... the baby gets tangled in a blanket in the back seat and suffocates .
first murder in long beach , and it was my old man .
just a little kid , that must' ve been hell .
you get through anything when you have to , but it was ....
what kept me sane was the cop who arrested my old man kind of adopted me .
captain mcauley , he was a good guy .
but this ...
... is the ex wife ?
yeah , that' s maggie .
who' s this ?
that' s my son , joey .
you have a son ?
i' m sorry i lied to you when i said i didn' t have any kids .
i' m sorry .
why did you lie to me ?
i don' t know .
i hadn' t seen him in a long time .
the divorce was a mess .
maggie had been seeing this guy and ....
i don' t know , i just ....
i lost control of the situation .
lost control ? ls that cop talk ?
we fought a lot , shouting and yelling .
but it never got physical .
and then one day , it did .
i lost control .
i , of course , regretted it .
but we never got over that .
on top of that , i think my son might' ve killed a guy the other night .
what ?
i' m just trying to tell you everything .
yeah , okay .
okay .
why haven' t you seen him ?
i tried at first , but maggie made it difficult .
i had supervised visits with a social worker watching .
like i was a criminal .
like i was back going to prison to see my old man .
i couldn' t take it .
so you just stopped seeing him ?
not just like that .
maggie was also doing a number on him , so he didn' t want to be around me .
i just walked away .
i quit .
maybe i should' ve tried harder .
i don' t know .
why couldn' t you tell me this before ?
well , i ....
i don' t know , i ....
that was me .
with you , it' s different .
i didn' t wanna ruin that .
are you all right ?
yeah .
it' s what i asked for , isn' t it ?
not so simple , huh ?
no .
no , it' s not .
i' m not your ex wife .
i won' t judge you .
i never have , i won' t start now .
but i' ve gotta think about this .
i' ve gotta think about this .
see you , okay ?
gina , i want you to know i got a lot of respect for you .
the way you got your shit together for your kid .
i got no problem with you .
just tell me where joey is .
look , i don' t know  don' t !
i don' t wanna hear it .
i' il tell you what .
i' il give you till 1 2 noon .
plenty of time to feed your kid , whatever you gotta do .
but after that , you find joey , okay ?
yeah .
he' s a good looking kid .
lamarca .
it' s gina .
i need some money to pay the taxi .
all right , i' il be right down .
you okay ?
no .
it' s 52 bucks .
give him $60 , he' s a nice guy .
who' s this ?
your grandson .
i try not to smoke around him .
sometimes it' s just , you know ....
what' s his name ?
angelo .
we haven' t eaten .
got anything to eat ?
i' il make you something .
does joey help you out ?
he would if he could , i guess .
how do you pay your rent ?
workfare .
flipping hamburgers .
until they figure out i' m dipping in the register , which is any day now .
then i' il be totally fucked .
when did you see him last ?
night before last .
said he was gonna get some money and go .
go where ?
like he knows ?
florida .
key west .
whenever he gets rabbity , he' s going to florida .
like it' s some magic country when it' s only the dope capital of the world .
can i ask you a question without you getting mad ?
depends .
when you left joey , was it hard ?
very hard .
you miss him ?
of course .
it get easier , you know , missing him after a while ?
you just stop thinking about it .
put your head down , keep walking .
otherwise it' d be too difficult .
was it better for joey , you think , that you left ?
for a while .
all i know is i missed out on stuff .
like what ?
like teaching him about things .
like good music .
old movies .
not being afraid to fight .
stuff like that .
i guess what you want and what you can do are different things sometimes .
gina , i wanna help joey .
you can' t help him .
you never did .
that' s what he says .
i' m gonna go buy some smokes .
can i borrow a couple bucks ?
yeah , my wallet is in the hall on that table .
you need anything ?

he was up there with a gun .
reg is over there .
oh , no .
jesus .

they called for an assist but didn' t wait .
you don' t go in for a murder suspect without backup !
he said you and him were already here before together alone .
goddamn it , reg .
one question .
can i have a statement ?
chief henderson .
lieutenant katt , long beach police .
crime scene is in here .
lt. lamarca !
chief wants to see you .
a. 45 caliber reported stolen from a clinic this morning .
suspect' s name is joseph lamarca .
he' s at
wait a minute .
not now .
you don' t have enough to make joey the prime suspect .
i know it' s your kid  evidence .
rossi didn' t see it .
i didn' t see it .
he didn' t see anybody .
you said joey hung out here .
that was just a lead .
it doesn' t prove anything .
this is an investigation .
i' m just saying you don' t have enough to make him the prime suspect .
we got a fingerprint match on the murder weapon .
i' m sorry , lieutenant .
it' s definitely your boy .
i' m here at the crime scene at the boardwalk ... ... where a detective was gunned down during a manhunt for joseph lamarca ... ... a murder suspect police consider armed and dangerous .
they' re tearing the house apart .
they say joey killed some cop .
not some cop .
my partner .
i know what they' il do when they find him .
i know what cops do to cop killers .
one way or another , they' il find a way to kill him .
it' s too late .
it' s not his fault .
then whose fault is it ?
did you pull the trigger ?
he doesn' t know what he' s doing .
don' t start with that .
you choose right or wrong .
he' s got nobody to blame but himself .
please help him .
you' re all he' s got .
then he' s got nothing .
please , help him !
don' t walk away from him again !
himself the son of angelo lamarca , executed for a horrific murder in 1 959 .
this photo shows lamarca being booked for the murder of the baby ... ... who was strangled to death while lamarca attempted to collect the ransom .
marge .
here .
take these into the living room .
come on now .
come on .
i' m sorry it was your boy .
that' il be hard for you .
i' m sorry .
i' m just so sorry .
it' s hard to believe reg will never be coming home again .
why did he do it , vince ?
reg never would have hurt your boy .
it' s just so wrong .
it' s just ....
it' s just so wrong .
i swear to god , if there' s anything i can do ....
daddy , no !
bree' s gonna miss him the most .
lamarca has had a long career with this department ... ... living down the tragedy of his father' s past and that of his troubled ....
hi .
hi .
where' s angelo ?
asleep in your bed .
lamarca has been moved to a different case .
there they go .
the big story .
i don' t know what to say .
i' m sorry , vincent .
i went to see reg' s wife .
you know , all the other cops wouldn' t look at me .
just like it was at school .
nobody says anything , but they think you' re guilty too .
you can' t blame yourself for everything .
ls joey my fault ?
i don' t know .
but you' re not responsible for everything your son does .
he' s gotta choose who he wants to be .
you think we get a choice ?
we just pretend that we got a choice .
it' s more like a sentence .
when my old man did what he did , i felt so bad , you know .
i felt like i was the criminal .
no way i' d feel that way again .
i' d be so good nobody could pin anything on me .
that was my choice .
but now , whether your dad is a cop or a murderer ... ... some kid' s father' s not coming home .
that' s the real life sentence .
yeah .
so , what do we do , michelle ?
want your keys back ?
lamarca .
i didn' t shoot that cop .
joey ?
you hear me ?
i didn' t shoot him .
i didn' t shoot him .
somebody did .
i just left the wife and daughter crying .
well , it wasn' t me .
let' s meet where we watched the planes .
what ?
remember we used to watch the planes ?
yeah .
remember where that was ?
yeah .
i' il be there , just me .
why should i trust you ?
joey , you don' t have a choice .
i' il be there by myself , i promise .
please .
you gotta do it .
please .
all right .
you gonna meet him ?
i hope so .
what are you looking at ?
the van down there .
they' re tapping the phone .
but you' re on their side .
i don' t think they see it i don' t think they see it that way .
speak .
let' s not play games .
sorry , chief .
why get cute about the meeting spot ?
i know what happens if the wrong cop goes .
you got my word that nothing' s gonna happen to joey .
your word is good with me . lf i can , i' il bring him in to you .
i gotta go .
there will be a lot of cops up here looking for me .
bring angelo to your place .
where are you going ?
you can' t say what you don' t know .
you still watch those planes .
yeah .
i met angelo .
gina brought him over .
nice little kid .
because of gina , not me .
she won' t let me see him .
she says i gotta stay away till i get clean .
which will be whenever .
i got this lawyer ready to meet with us .
you wanna take me in ?
i wanna help .
did you hear me ?
i didn' t do the cop .
i come to talk to you , you bring up a lawyer .
you think maybe your lawyer could get me the electric chair ?
fuck .
too weird , huh ?
lf i got the chair too , just like your old man ?
you ever think about him ?
sure .
did you love him ?
he was my father .
of course i did .
because someone' s your father means you gotta love him ?
you think i love you ?
i don' t know .
right .
you don' t even know me , do you ?
no , i guess i don' t .
you wanna tell me ?
you know i was quarterback in high school ?
no .
your mother never told me anything .
i used to look for you in the stands .
i would' ve loved to see you play .
you should have .
i was good .
we beat cedarhurst in the county finals .
first time in 24 years .
the crowd went wild .
i didn' t need drugs that night .
i was good then .
you should have seen me .
i wish i had .
all right , fuck it .
we all got reasons .
so you believe me about the cop , or what ?
your prints are on the gun .
i wasn' t there when the cop went down .
that cop had a name .
his name was reg .
so who was there ?
fucking scumbag dealer named spyder .
he' s after me for his fucking $4000 .
lf i had it , i' d be on a plane to florida .
did you see him ?
no , i didn' t see him do it but i saw him right after .
i mean right after . ln the alley there .
what about picasso ?
i don' t know .
look , i was fucked up ... ... he came at me with a knife ....
i guess , in a sense , i killed him .
ln a sense ?
i don' t know what happened .
one minute we' re fighting and the next he' s dead .
but that wasn' t me .
all right ?
that wasn' t the real me .
i wouldn' t count on a jury believing that .
this is something you can' t run away from .
you can' t .
you can' t run .
do you believe me ?
it doesn' t matter what i believe .
plead self defense , you could get off with maybe six years .
what if it matters to me what you believe ?
i gotta take you in , you know that .
what are you , a cop or my father ?
i' m both .
i' m getting out of here .
what are you now ?
joey , come on !
just fucking with you .
i knew the answer .
you know , when i was a kid , i wanted to be a cop .
i really did .
just like you .
chief .
where' s your boy ?
picasso worked for a dealer called spyder .
spyder' s after joey for his $4000 .
joey told me he saw spyder in the alley by the casino after reg was hit .
why didn' t you bring your boy in ?
he told me he didn' t kill reg .
you believed him ?
i believed him .
he' s your son , of course you wanna believe him .
i' ve been a cop 25 years  the operative word is " cop .
you' re not sometimes a cop , sometimes a junkie' s father .
you' re either a cop or you' re not a cop .
end of story .
this is bullshit .
you' re under oath to perform your duty . ln this investigation
what investigation ?
you already made your mind up .
peace , all right ?
don' t be playing no bullshit neither .
a motherfucking ghost .
how come you still breathing , casper ?
listen .
a thousand dollars for my nova .
cops got your wheels , boy .
i' m sorry , man .
will you do me a solid here , please ?
i need help .
please .
what' s the ring ?
it' s a football ring .
it ain' t for sale .
let me see .
this is worth like 1 00 , easy .
but i' m saving it for my son .
we' il treat it like a loan until i get you the 1 00 back .
yeah , sure .
all right .
here .
no , carl , i can' t use this .
i need cash .
you' d be the first junkie who couldn' t .
give me the ring .
back the fuck off !
you lucky i' m giving you anything !
please , the ring' s important .
it' s for my boy .
you ain' t gonna be around to see your boy .
and you ain' t going to florida .
you got spyder and the cops chasing you .
you a junkie !
only place you' re going is the morgue .
county , motherfucker !
wait a minute !
what are you doing ?
there' s nothing in there for you .
want to come over and see my soup ?
look , here' s grandpa .
this is evelyn hancock .
she' s an old friend .
you' re a big boy , angelo .
evelyn is with child services .
what' s going on ?
she' s taking angelo until gina comes back .
it' s temporary .
she' s not coming back .
i can' t take care of him .
can i talk to you ?
sure .
go see this nice lady .
i just wanna talk to him for a minute .
what are you doing ?
what am i supposed to do ?
take care of him .
you' re his grandfather .
nice idea , but i can' t .
vincent , gina' s gone .
you think his father is coming back ?
this is the best thing for him .
no , you' re the best thing for him .
i can help you .
you never had kids , you don' t know .
you' re gonna walk away from him .
what do you mean , walking away ?
like with joey .
i' m not walking away !
that' s what you told me you did with joey .
i' m not walk away ?
let me show you something .
let me show you something .
you think i want him growing up with this ?
like the son of frankenstein ?
you never know what he might do .
don' t mention his father !
call it walking away , but i' m doing the best thing for him .
that is not about angelo .
that' s about you .
you told me .
you told me you never had a choice , right ?
well , you got one right here .
michelle , try to understand .
right now it' s more than i can handle .
i can' t do it .
that' s how you make a choice .
goodbye .
morning .
let' s try to wrap this up .
we got pretty substantial evidence .
fingerprints are clear .
there are no others on the gun .
shells and ballistics identify it as the shooter' s .
we know he frequented the carousel and used drugs there .
excuse me , sir .
go ahead , dave .
a shoe print in the blood doesn' t match lamarca' s size .
so , what do we think ?
that o. j. was there ?
maybe bruno magli ?
one last thing .
this kid has killed twice .
don' t give him a chance to do it again .
we got that ?
you got a phone call on my phone .
how come you' re giving out my number ?
i don' t even know your number .
this guy knows it .
make sure you leave a nickel in the ashtray .
dave simon .
i couldn' t call you direct .
what' s going on ?
i have something you should see .
could we meet at york and 59th street bridge ?
it' s copies of crime scene photos i tried to mention .
what are they ?
footprints in the blood at the top of the ladder .
we can account for all of them ... ... except for one heel from a size 1 0 cowboy boot made by justin boots .
at your ex wife' s we found some of joey' s stuff .
joey wears a size 1 2 1 / 2 shoe .
there' s no 1 2 1 / 2 prints anywhere in this blood .
i appreciate this .
well , you know , it doesn' t all have to be bullshit .
you born in long beach ?
no , army brat .
we lived all over .
distant climes , huh ?
we traveled a lot .
now we got a baby .
i hardly get out .
kids change everything .
lsn' t that the truth .
sir , listen , i' m real sorry about your son .
i appreciate it .
thank you very much .
i appreciate that .
it' s more than i can handle .
we just pretend we got a choice .
we don' t have a son , i do .
i wasn' t gonna feel that again .
you think i love you ?
i should' ve tried harder .
you said you never had a choice .
what are you , a cop or my father ?
that' s my son .
please help him .
you' re all he' s got .
he' s your son !
this is something you can' t run away from .
just like his dad .
sorry , sir .
we' re closed .
anybody know where spyder is ?
we' re closed , mister .
where' s spyder ?
peace , brother .
peace .

i got proof .
he wants to see me , i' m at the seaway motel .
room 1 05 .
you got that ?
yeah .
1 05 .
seaway motel .
here' s where we' re expecting the storm .
on our map , lots of green .
and within that , yellows and reds .
these are the areas where we' re expecting heavy rain .
in new york city , the storm will move in by tomorrow morning .
you got something for me ?
dave simon .
lt. lamarca .

i want backup and emergency units to ocean and neptune .
lt. katt ?
don' t fucking move !
don' t move a finger .
give me the gun .
give me the fucking gun !
go ahead .

what the fuck is this ?
what are you doing telling people i shot that cop ?
i know you killed my partner , scumbag .
it was your junkie kid .
i' m not the only one that thinks so .
you left a footprint in his blood .
are those justin , size 1 0 ?
you' re a long way from manhattan .
but too close to home for you .
you broke into my property .
i' m within my rights to defend it .
i couldn' t take the chance he' d hurt gina or angelo .
would be just like him .
you broke in here pretty good .
you learn that in cop school ?
so , what now , joey ?
hold back and hold your fire !
hold your fire !
keep eyes on that door and those windows !
block that road !
i don' t want one tv van !
right up there .
okay , enough .
give me the gun .
it' il be hard enough getting you out alive without them seeing that .
this is no game , son .
please .
you saved my life but they didn' t see it .
they don' t care .
i ain' t going to jail .
i understand .
i wanna help you , just ....
just give me the gun .
lt. lamarca , signal your location !
all right , talk .
talk ?
what are you now , fucking oprah ?
you got a son and a woman that loves you .
don' t run away from that .
you did .
yeah .
i did .
and i' m sorry .
i' ve regretted it ever since .
we all gotta pay one way or another , right ?
what' s going on ?
it' s called " suicide by cop .
quick and easy .
no pills .
no fucking around .
i thought i' d try it .
how did we get this way ?
i remember the day you were born .
well , i remember the day you left .
so we' re even .
i' m not gonna kill you , son .
well ....
your friends out there will .
you know it .
there he is !
you two !
hold back !
hold your fire !
get the building secure .
give me the gun .
i don' t want to shoot you .
you do .
you think i deserve it .
get back !
but you won' t .
it' s not the real you .
you don' t know anything about me .
i do .
you' re my kid .
you' re not a bad kid .
you' re a scared kid whose old man left him .
you didn' t get a choice and it hurt .
i know .
but you' re my son .
you always will be .
then why did you leave ?
i was stupid .
i forgot what it felt like to be alone .
you don' t want to do to angelo what i did to you .
what my old man did to me .
you can' t .
he don' t need a junkie .
you' re not a junkie to him .
my old man wasn' t a killer to me .
when my old man left , i hated him all my life for what he did to me .
but all i wanted was for him to walk in the door because i missed him .
i didn' t want to be alone anymore .
we all pay a price for what we do , but when' s enough ?
because i paid .
and you paid .
and what ?
now angelo has to pay ?
you can' t !
we got a second chance here , me and you .
i let you think you didn' t matter to me .
but i swear i won' t run away again .
i' il stay with you , i promise .
you just need to choose it .
know how many people would love a second chance ?
help me .
dad , are you okay ?
it' s just my shoulder .
i didn' t do it .
i know .
get rid of the guns !
empty your pockets .
don' t give them an excuse .
they' il kill me .
it' s okay .
i' m with you now .
ldentify yourself !
it' s okay .
it' s okay , there are no guns !
raise your hands .
see the hands ?
no guns .
get down , drop the gun !
show us your hands !
they' re down .
move away !
move away from him !
told you to move away !
take it easy .
all right , take it easy on him !
listen !
anything happens to him , you' il answer to me .
easy with him !
it' il be all right .
it' s okay , son .
it' s okay .
here he comes .
this way .

i love you .
i want to go on the rocks .
