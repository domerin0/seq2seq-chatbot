adrian ain' t sharp .
adrian is a loser .
she' s pushin ' 30 freakin ' years old . if she don' t watch out , she' s gonna die alone . i' m 30 myself .

paulie ! i got it . ... bicentennial fight with mac lee green ... here in philadelphia at the fabulous spectrum .
larry .
you' re speaking now of your much publicized bicentennial fight .
right .
this is gonna be the greatest sporting event in the country' s history .
a gala occurrence with me beatin ' green like he committed a crime .
would you take a look at that guy ? i mean , where are the real fighters gonna come from ?
the pros .
all we got today are jig clowns . ... on january 1 st .
the first major event in the country' s
clown ?
that' s right , clown .
and in keeping with great events throughout the country' s history ...
apollo creed will duplicate the cracking of the liberty bell by cracking green .
you' re callin ' apollo creed a clown ?
what else ?
look at him .
stay in school and use your brain .
be a doctor , be a lawyer , carry a leather briefcase .
forget about sports as a profession .
sports make you grunt and smell .
be a thinker , not a stinker .
thanks a lot , champ .
you crazy ?
this man is champion of the world .
he took his best shot and become champ .
what shot did you ever take ?
hey , rocky , you' re not happy with your life , that' s nice .
but me , i got a business goin ' . i don' t have to take no shots . ... no one having gone more than 1 2 rounds with him ...
that' s right . and that was jake dale last june .
stick that up your business .
why you gettin ' so insulted ?
you want me to take a shot ?
all right . i' il take a shot .
hey , rocky , how ' bout a bottle ?
no wine , man .
come on . just a little .
buy us some thunderbird .
marie , does your brother know you' re hangin ' out so late ?
get lost , creep .
screw you , yo yo !
these guys teach you to talk like that ?
stuff it !
don' t you never say that to me .
you stink up the neighborhood !
you know , you can
when i was your age , only one girl in the whole neighborhood talked like that .
that was it . just one .
what are you doin ' ? it' il make your teeth yellow .
don' t do that . i like yellow teeth ! it' il make your breath like garbage .
maybe i like garbage .
nobody likes garbage .
anyway , this girl with the dirty mouth wasn' t bad lookin ' ... but none of the guys ever took her serious .
they never took her out for any serious date .
why ?
' cause that' s the way guys are .
they laugh when you talk dirty .
they think you' re cute .
after a while , you get a reputation .
you get no respect .
you understand ?
you get no respect . i gotta use a bad word : whore .
you understand ?
whore .
see ?
you use dirty words , and maybe you end up becomin ' a whore .
come on , rocky . i' m 1 2 .
that don' t matter .
you don' t really have to be one .
just act like one and that' s it .
boom !
bing !
you get a bad rep .
you understand ?
twenty years from now , people are gonna say ...
do you remember marie ?
no .
who was she ?
she was the little whore who hung down at the atomic hoagie shop .
oh , yeah .
now i remember her .
you see , they don' t remember you .
they remember the rep .
you understand ?
you got a boyfriend ?
no , you ain' t got a boyfriend .
you know why ?
why don' t you think you have a boyfriend ?
' cause you' re hangin ' out with them coconuts on the corner .
you hang around coconuts , you get nowhere .
they' re lemons .
lemons .
you hang out with nice people , you get nice friends .
you understand ?
you hang out with smart people , you get smart friends .
you hang out with yo yo people , you get yo yo friends .
you see , it' s simple mathematics . i hope you ain' t  i won' t .
what was i gonna say ?
you hope i don' t keep actin ' like a whore or i' il turn into one , right ?
good night , rocky .
good night .
take care .
hey , rocky .
yo .
screw you , creep o !
yeah , who are you to give advice , creep o ?
who are you ?
are the doctor' s reports confirmed ?
definitely .
says here mac lee green has suffered ...
a severely cracked third metacarpal in his left hand .
damn !
we can cancel the fight indefinitely if you' re set on fighting green .
hey , it ain' t just green .
what about all the time apollo has invested ?
we can find a solution .
solution nothin ' .
find me another ranked contender in a flash, jergens .
don' t play games with my client .
apollo' s already done a million dollars ' worth of publicity ... has made contractual obligations with 20 different organizations .
he' s not going to be embarrassed ! i contacted ernie roman' s manager .
ernie' s fighting in france that same week .
then get me buddy shaw .
he' s ranked fifth .
went to california and gained 50 pounds . i called every worthwhile contender .
they all say five weeks isn' t enough time to get into shape .
shape nothin ' , man .
they' re afraid .
they know everybody is gonna see this fight .
none of them' s got a prayer of whippin ' me .
they' re makin ' excuses so they don' t have to be the chump who gets whipped .
all i can say is i' m a good promoter . i' ve promoted fights in every goddamn country in the world ... and i' ve broken my ass over this one . i don' t know what else to do !
i do .
without a ranked contender , what this fight needs is a novelty .
this is the land of opportunity , right ?
so , apollo creed , on january 1 st ... gives a local underdog fighter an opportunity .
a snow white underdog , and i' m gonna put his face on this poster with me .
and i' il tell you why .
because i' m sentimental .
a lot of other people in this country are just as sentimental ... and there' s nothing they' d like better than to see apollo creed ... give a local philadelphia boy a shot at the greatest title in the world ... on this country' s biggest birthday .
now that' s the way i see it .... and that' s the way it' s gonna be .
apollo , i like it . it' s very american .
no, jergens . it' s very smart .
what is it ? i wanna check this thing out .
you said pick up two yards from snyder and a grand from cappoli , right ?
no , no .
two yards from cappoli and a grand from snyder .
two yards .
write it down , okay ?
yeah , i got it .
who' s this girl you' re goin ' out with tomorrow night ?
how' d you know ? i know .
don' t you think i hear things ?
lot of canaries flyin ' around the docks . i' m goin ' out with paulie' s sister .
hey , rocky .
what ? i hear she' s retarded .
she ain' t retarded .
she' s shy , you know ?
tell you what to do .
take her to the zoo . i hear retards like the zoo .
this bum gotta say that ?
who you callin ' a bum ?
back it up , buddy . i' m callin ' you a bum !
relax , relax .
buddy' s in a bad mood . it' s his prostate .
he' s always in a bad mood .
you oughta count your blessings .
you' re still a healthy person . i don' t like your face . i don' t like yours either !
kiss my ass !
come out here !
relax !
relax .
my ears .
are you driving me crazy ?
both of you .
look .
buddy doesn' t like you .
some guys , they just hate for no reason .
capisce ?
yeah .
come here .
here' s 50 bucks .
you and your girl adrian , you have a nice time .
thanks .
how' d you know her name ?
you don' t think i hear things ?
hey , rock .
what ?
remember what i told you ?
take her to the zoo .
come on outta the car !
some more coffee , mr. creed ?
no , thanks , shirley .
what do you think about billy snow ?
fouls .
how about big chuck smith ?
no , he' s too old and dumb .
hey , that bobby judge , he' s a good boy .
no . i don' t feel no heat from that name .
joe zack' s a good prospect .
exactly what are you looking for , apollo ?
this is what i' m lookin ' for .
the italian stallion .
rocky balboa ?
never heard of him .
look , it' s the name , man .
the italian stallion .
the media will eat it up .
who discovered america ?
an italian , right ?
what would be better than to get it on with one of his descendants ?
he' s a southpaw . i don' t want you messin ' around with southpaws .
they do everything backwards .
southpaw nothin ' . i' il drop him in three .
apollo creed meets the italian stallion .
sounds like a damn monster movie .
what are you doin ' with that bat ? i used to be deadly at stickball .
your sister knows i' m comin ' ?
she' s very excited .
look at these swollen hands .
yeah .
the joints from carryin ' meat in and out of the freezer .
plays hell on the joints .
maybe you oughta see a doctor . i don' t need a doctor . i need a different job .
different job .
what kind of turkey ?
big ?
small ?
talk to gazzo .
tell him i' m a good man .
nothin ' bothers me . i' d make a great collector .
bustin ' bones don' t bother me .
don' t bother you .
big turkey , right ?
gazzo' s gotta gimme forget gazzo . it' s a bad job .
you got a match ?
go to him for me .
as a favor .
yeah , yeah .
last time i had a turkey ... was when they had a two dollar special at horn and hardart' s three years ago .
last year , me and the turtles had spam .
your sister knows i' m comin ' ?
yeah , yeah .
she' s very excited .
will you forget about gazzo ? i don' t ask nobody twice .
don' t ask nobody twice .
you' re sure your sister knows i' m comin ' ?
yeah .
she' s very excited .
paulie , you' re late .
you call the hospital ?
she calls the hospital if i' m ten minutes late .
yo , how you doin ' ? i told you , she' s very excited .
why didn' t you tell me you were bringin ' him here ? i' m not ready for this .
would it make a difference if you were ?
he' s takin ' you out .
no , i can' t . i want you outta the kitchen right now .
i won' t .
i want you outta here instamatically ! i' m sick of seein ' you hanging around like a freakin ' spider .
go out and live .
enjoy life ! i can' t go !
don' t get wise with me now . i' m tired of you bein ' a loser .
don' t call me that , paulie !
apollo creed says he' il be shopping for another victim ... to fill green' s vacancy for the bicentennial championship fight
why didn' t you tell me you were bringing him home ?
how do you know i didn' t ? i can' t go , paulie . i won' t go !
why ?
paulie , it' s thanksgiving . i got a turkey in the oven .
oh , a turkey in the oven .
turkey in the oven .
you want the bird ?
go in the alley and eat the bird !
aw , paulie ! i want you outta here !
get outta the house !
go out and enjoy your freakin ' life !
you hungry , rock ?
hey , yo , paulie , maybe we better forget all this , you know ?
forget nothin ' .
go ahead .
tell her somethin ' funny .
ain' t nothin ' to talk about .
she' s in a bad mood . i' m in a bad mood .
you can do funny things .
you wanna go out with my sister ?
yeah .
well
i don' t know what to say .
funny .
yo , adrian . it' s me , rocky ?
rocky , you know ?
listen , uh i don' t know what to say , ' cause i ain' t never talked to no door before .
what do i say to a door ?
we better forget this .
you' re doin ' fine . i ain' t doin ' fine . i look like an idiot .
keep doin ' what you' re doin ' .
funny . i know all about these things . i feel like a jerk .
yo , adrian , it' s rocky again .
listen , uh , i know you ain' t too happy at this moment .
but could you do me a favor ? i ain' t got nobody to spend thanksgiving with .
so , uh , how about maybe you and i ... go out together , get something to eat .
maybe laugh a little bit .
who knows , you know ?
would you like to , uh
would you like to , maybe , you and me go out together ?
what do you think ?
would you like to ?
we' re gonna have a good time .
we' il have a real good time .
thanks for the bird .
i' m gonna turn the tv off . i got a headache .
what' s your sister like to do ? ice skate .
adrian , come on .
you' re letting the heat out .
who pays the bills around here ?
listen , i don' t want no turkey anyway , you know ?
but it was thanksgiving .
what ? it was thanksgiving .
yeah , to you .
but to me it' s thursday , right ?
it looks kind of quiet . i think it' s closed .
no , i think we' re just early or something like that .
we' re closed .
what ? i said we' re closed .
yeah .
hey , listen . i' m gonna smooth this guy out .
wait here . i' il be right back .
we could go someplace else .
no , it' s okay .
are you closed to the general public , or are you just closed to everybody ? it' s after 6 : 00 . it' s thanksgiving .
that' s why there' s nobody here .
besides , you ain' t supposed to be in here .
so do me a favor and not stay here .
could you do me a favor ?
come on .
we' re not operatin ' .
look .
this girl here ain' t feeling well .
doctors say she should go out and exercise . ice skating' s probably the best thing .
so what do you want from me ?
you can see she ain' t feelin ' too good . if you can let her on the ice for a few minutes , i' d appreciate it .
ten minutes , ten bucks .
ten bucks ?
how about eight bucks ?
come on . it' s thanksgiving .
all right .
nine bucks , you got a deal .
you have the ice to yourself .
ten bucks .
give her the blades .
aren' t you skating ?
no , i ain' t skated since i was 1 5 .
that' s when i started fightin ' .
skating' s kind of bad for the ankles , you know ?
you' re a pretty good skater , aren' t you ?
like i was sayin ' before on the way over here ... fightin ' used to be tops with me , but no more .
all i wanted to do outta fightin ' was prove i was no bum that i had the stuff to make a good pro .
you never got the chance ? i ain' t cryin ' about it . i still fight . i do it like a hobby .
the trouble is i' m a southpaw .
what' s a southpaw ?
a southpaw means you' re left handed .
a southpaw throws your timing off . it throws other guys ' timing off , makes them look awkward .
nobody wants to look awkward .
you know where " southpaw " came from ?
nine minutes !
a long time ago , there was this guy maybe a couple hundred years ago he was fightin ' in the i think it was around philadelphia .
his arm he was left handed .
his arm was facing towards new jersey .
and that' s south .
so naturally they called him " south paw . " you see ?
southpaw , south jersey , south camden .
southpaw .
you know what i mean ?
things probably worked out for the best , don' t you think ?
never got a chance because you' re left handed , huh ?
that' s absolutely true , you know ?
watch out .
ah !
ah ! i just dislocated my finger .
ah !
look at that .
wait . it ain' t your fault .
look .
see ? i had it it' s an old wound .
you see that ?
look .
see ?
nothin ' . it bends like that . i originally done it push the button .
bong . it works . it ain' t your fault .
look .
seven minutes ! i originally done it i keep pictures of all my fights . i originally done it in the baby crenshaw fight .
baby' s about the size of an airplane . i broke both hands on his face . i lost that fight , but that' s a nice picture , don' t you think ?
real nice .
come on .
you havin ' a good time ?
you can see i ain' t too graceful . i don' t move well , but i can really swat . i can really hit hard .
but i' m a southpaw , and nobody wants to fight no southpaw .
you know how i got started in fightin ' ?
am i talkin ' too loud ?
three minutes !
my father , he' s a my old man , he was never too smart .
he says to me , " you weren' t born with much of a brain ... so you better start using your body .
so i become a fighter .
you know what i mean ?
why you laughing ?
my mother , she said the opposite thing .
what did she say the opposite ?
she said , " you weren' t born with much of a body ... so you better develop your brain .
did she say that ?
yo , time !
can i ask you a question ?
absolutely .
why do you wanna fight ?
' cause i can' t sing or dance .
don' t fall !
that was terrific . i' m pretty good at this .
you like the way i skate ?
last fight i had , i had with this guy named spider rico .
he busted my head up there .
you see that scar ? i' il tell you , things get pretty rough in the ring .
you know , some people are very shy by nature . i suppose .
i say you' re very shy by nature , you know ? i suppose .
the bum from the dark .
get a job , you bum !
some people think that being shy is a disease ... but it don' t bother me none .
don' t bother me either .
so why' d i bother bringin ' it up ?
' cause i' m dumb , that' s why .
i think we make a sharp couple of coconuts . i' m dumb and you' re shy .
what do you think ?
i don' t understand why anybody would wanna be a fighter .
you gotta be a moron to wanna be a fighter , you know what i mean ? it' s a racket where you' re almost guaranteed to end up a bum . i don' t think you' re a bum . i' m at least half a bum .
but i' il tell you something .
worst thing about fightin ' is the mornin ' after .
you know ?
morning after .
yeah , the mornin ' after a fight ... you' re like a large wound , you know what i mean ?
sometimes i got pains all over me . i feel like callin ' a taxi to take me from the bed into the bathroom .
your hair hurts , your eyes hurt .
your face is busted up .
your hands are swollen .
look at this face .
sixty four fights .
look at that nose .
you see that nose ?
that nose ain' t never been broken . i had guys bustin ' on it . i had guys chewin ' on it , twistin ' and punchin ' it . i mean , whack , boom .
these guys are hittin ' my nose all the time .
never broke it . i' m very proud of that .
that' s rare .
why do you do it if it hurts ?
why you think ?
' cause ... you can' t sing and dance ?
yeah , somethin ' like that .

they' re probably lookin ' for sparrin ' partners for creed . i said that before , you dumb dago !
i been comin ' here for six years , and six years you been stickin ' it to me .
how come ?
you don' t wanna know !
yeah , i wanna know how come .
you wanna know ? i wanna know now !
okay , i' m gonna tell ya !
you had the talent to become a good fighter , and instead of that ... you became a leg breaker for some cheap , second rate loan shark ! it' s a livin ' . it' s a waste of life !
yes .
may i help you ?
oh , you must be mr. rocky balboa .
mr. jergens' s expecting you .
just a moment .
mr. rocky balboa to see you , sir .
fine .
please go in , mr. balboa .
can i have that ?
oh , certainly .
thanks .
mr. balboa .
how are you ?
george jergens .
take a chair , please .
thanks .
mr. balboa .
call me rocky .
rocky , you got any representation ?
you have a manager ?
uh , no , just me .
rocky , i' ve got a proposition i' d like to make to you .
about sparrin ' ?
beg your pardon ? i know you' re lookin ' for sparrin ' partners , and i' m very available . i' m sure you are .
absolutely .
sparrin ' with the champ would be an honor , and you know what , mr. jergens ?
what ? i wouldn' t take no cheap shots . i' d really be a good sparrin ' partner .
you don' t understand me , rocky .
my proposition' s this .
would you be interested in fighting apollo creed ... for the world heavyweight championship ?
listen , rocky .
apollo' s seen you fight .
he likes you .
he wants to fight you .
well , it' s just that , you see , uh ... i fight in clubs , you know , and i' m really a ham and egger .
this guy , he' s the best , and , uh ... it wouldn' t be such a good fight , but thank you very much . i appreciate it .
rocky , do you believe that america is the land of opportunity ?
apollo creed does ... and he' s gonna prove it to the whole world ... by giving an unknown a shot at the title .
and that unknown is you .
he picked you , rocky .
it' s the chance of a lifetime .
you can' t pass it by .
what do you say ?
we wanna ask apollo a few questions .
apollo , how do you like the city of brotherly love ?
well , just being in philadelphia makes me feel patriotic .
beautiful people in a beautiful city coming up to me on the street ... wishing me the best . i love my philadelphia brothers , and i' m proud to be an american .
apollo ?
champ ?
why did you agree to fight a man who has virtually no chance of winning ? if history proves one thing ...
american history proves that everybody' s got a chance to win .
didn' t you guys ever hear of valley forge or bunker hill ?
apollo ? it is a coincidence that you' re fighting a white man ... on the most celebrated day in the country' s history ? i don' t know . is it a coincidence that he' s fighting a black man ... on the most celebrated day in the country' s history ?
right on , apollo !
tell the truth , brother !
listen , apollo .
how do you feel about your challenger ?
how do i feel about him ?
come here , rock .
my main man .
rocky , ain' t you italian ?
yeah , i' m italian .
now what does that mean ?
that means , if he can' t fight , i' il bet he can cook .
do me a favor .
his lungs , punch out .
paulie .
rocky , how do you expect to fight apollo creed ?
oh , jeez , you know , creed' s the best . i guess i' il have to do the best i can .
tell me , rocky , just between us ... where did you get the name " italian stallion " ?
oh , uh , i invented that about eight years ago when i was eatin' dinner .
rocky , now your payday will be $ 1 50, 000 .
any comment ?
you got no comment , rocky , right ?
no .
thank you , rocky .
wait a minute . i just wanna say hi to my girlfriend , okay ?
yo , adrian , it' s me , rocky .
you believe all this ?
microphones and all that stuff .
you didn' t .
thank you , rocky .
who you pushin ' , man ?
smack you in the mouth !
thank you , rocky .
don' t it matter he makin ' you out a fool ? i' d break his lips .
he' s takin ' cheap shots .
don' t bother me none .
yo , rocky , i guess you' il be lookin ' for people to help you out .
help what ?
you know ... keep you livin ' the clean life . i do okay , you know .
you need someone to help with the exercise ... and someone standin ' by with a towel or runnin ' errands ?
hey , yo , paulie , who cared about me yesterday ?
nobody .
so i just think i' m gonna train myself , you know ?
without such good people around to help you ... you don' t have such a good chance .
einstein flunked outta school twice .
that so ?
yeah .
beethoven was deaf .
helen keller was blind . i think rocky' s got a good chance .
want me to get you a beer , paulie ?
you lookin ' to do a good deed ?
keep outta my freakin ' life !
what' d i do ?
nothin ' .
did i say something wrong ?
you didn' t say nothin ' . it' s all right .
that' s right !
you didn' t say nothin ' !
nothin ' at all !
i gotta go .
where are the freakin ' pretzels ?
i' d like to have a pretzel .
hey , we ain' t got any beer ?
i thought you were supposed to pick up some beer !
how' d you like hearin ' your name on tv tonight ?
uh ... i was shocked .
why' d you do that ?
you' re puttin ' me on , right ?
absolutely .
what time should i expect you ?
about 7 : 00 .
okay .
hey .
you know how i said that stuff on tv didn' t bother me ?
it did .
listen , the reason i brought you here is because i ... i wanna know if you got any money for training expenses . i got a few dollars .
a few bucks ?
here .
put this in your glove .
what' s this ?
500 bucks .
don' t worry about it .
you know , you ain' t never had any luck ... but i think this time lady luck may be in your corner .
what do you think ?
maybe .
thanks for the money , tony . it' s okay .
don' t worry about it . i' il see ya .
wait a minute .
what ?
you' re in trainin ' .
come on .
yo , tony .
what ?
you gonna show up at the fight ?
ringside .
i' il see ya .
hello , kid . i seen your light .
can i come in ?
yeah , sure .
yeah .
good .
hey , it' s a nice place here .
anyway , what i come to tell you is that ... that what happened to you is freak luck .
yeah , freak luck .
ain' t it true ?
look at the other guys .
they' re good fighters , right ?
they' re colorful .
they got good records .
they fight their guts out for peanuts .
but you , you got a shot at the title !
freak luck is a strange thing , you know ?
sure is .
can i sit down ?
yeah , sure .
what the hell are those ?
domestic turtles .
the one on the top is cuff and the other guy' s link .
the rest are marbles .
yeah ?
they make good soup .
anyway .
look , i' m here to warn you .
you gotta be very careful about this shot that you got at the title .
because , like the bible says ... you ain' t gonna get a second chance .
yeah .
all right .
you thought of that , huh ?
well , what you need ... is a manager .
a manager .
listen to me . i know , because i been in this racket for 50 years .
50 years , huh ?
50 years . i' ve seen it all .
all of it .
you know what i done ? i have done it all .
you should' ve seen me when i knocked ginny russell outta the ring .
outta the goddamn ring , i tell ya .
september 1 4 , 1 923 ... and it was the same night that firpo knocks dempsey outta the ring .
so who gets the publicity ?
figure that out .
dempsey .
that' s right .
but why ?
' cause he was champ .
no !
because he had a manager . i had nothin ' .
i wanna show you somethin ' . i want you to look at my face .
look at this . i got 2 1 stitches over this left eye . i got 34 stitches over this eye .
you know i had my nose busted 1 7 times .
the last time was in that fight with sailor mike . i got that clippin ' here . it was a good fight .
wanna read that ?
well , it doesn' t matter .
anyway , he put this vegetation on my ear .
you kind of remind me of the rock , you know that ?
you really think so ?
that' s right .
you move like him , and you got heart like he did .
yeah , i got heart , but i ain' t got no locker , do i , mick ?
uh ... anyway
you know , when i begun in this business , kid i wanna make a suggestion .
don' t drink that piss before a fight . it' s no good for you . if you don' t mind my sayin ' .
anyway , you know , when i started in this racket ... pugs like us , we was treated like dogs .
for ten bucks , you gotta tear somebody' s throat out .
but i never had no management .
one time , this son of a bitch that i fought ... he put a nail right there . in his thumb . in the thumb of the glove .
he punched so many holes in my face , i had spit shootin ' outta my cheeks .
can you imagine that ?
anyway , when i tell you what i looked like when i was in my prime ... i want you to look at somethin ' .
look at that .
that' s the way i looked ... before these guys got at me .
that' s nice .
you didn' t take very good care of the picture , though .
well , i never had no management .
that' s the trouble , but i got all this knowledge . i got it up here .
now i wanna give it to you . i wanna give you this knowledge . i wanna take care of you . i wanna make sure that what happened to me doesn' t happen to you .
you know what i mean ?
mick , the fight' s set .
listen to me . i wanna be your manager .
you follow that ?
fight' s set . i don' t need no manager .
but you can' t buy what i' m gonna give you . i got pain and i got experience . i got pain and i got experience too .
listen , kid
hey , mick . i needed your help about ten years ago , right ?
ten years ago .
you never helped me none .
you didn' t care . if you wanted help i say , if you wanted help , why didn' t you just ask me , kid ? i asked , but you never heard nothin ' !
well , i i , uh i know i i' m 76 years old .
and , uh
took you long enough to get here .
took ten years to come to my house .
you don' t like my house ?
my house stink ?
that' s right , it stinks ! i didn' t ask no favors from you !
talk about your prime .
what about my prime , mick ?
at least you had a prime ! i ain' t had no prime . i ain' t had nothin ' .
legs are goin ' , everything is goin ' .
nobody' s givin ' me nothin ' .
guy comes up , offers me a fight .
big deal .
wanna fight the fight ?
yeah , i' il fight the big fight . i' m gonna go fight that big fight and i' m gonna get that ! i' m gonna get that !
and you wanna be ringside and see ?
do ya ?
you wanna help me out ?
do you wanna see me get my face kicked in ?
legs ain' t workin ' , nothing' s workin ' .
think i' il go and fight the champ .
yeah , i' il fight him .
get my face kicked in .
and you come around here .
you wanna move in with me ?
come on in . it' s a nice house !
real nice !
come on in ! it stinks !
this whole place stinks .
you wanna help me out ?
well , help me out !
come on .
help me out . i' m standin ' here !
it' s only about 28 degrees .
we' il check that forecast . i feel very mischievous , very weird , very i got vinyl seats in my car .
when i hit those seats this morning , i just went , " whoo ! " i figure if i' m up , everybody in the delaware valley should be up .
you agree with me ?
at 3 minutes past 4 .. 00 in the morning , what else you gonna do ?
hello ?
good morning , mrs. kramer .
this is don cabot , wybg philadelphia ?
how are you this morning ?
what ?
you have a lot of nerve callin' me at this hour of the morning !
good bye !
me and mrs. kramer are up , and it' s a good morning . i tell you , i need someone to snuggle with .
28 degrees . it' s cold out there .
we deserve it .
we' ve been getting away with murder the last couple of weeks .
our high today could be
tonight we' re back down in the 20 degree range .
a little colder in the suburbs .
tomorrow , with a little bit of luck , we may hit 40 .
but it' s 28 . it' s awfully chilly .
make sure you have it bundled up before you bring it out .
come on . it stinks in here , you know ?
yeah . i know .
did you kill all these things ?
no , across the street .
it' s like an animal morgue . it' s a little cold in here , ain' t it ?
yeah .
who killed all these things ?
are you crazy , paulie ? if you don' t pay gazzo , you end up on a hook .
gazzo' s a good man .
you know that .
don' t get excited . i know that .
that' s why i wanted you to talk to him about me and the collectin ' job . i can get me outta this stinkin ' freezer .
why don' t you do yourself a favor ?
keep this job .
you eat better .
moo .
does it ever snow in here ?

how do you think ? i' m not sure , rock .
what' s the story ?

what' s happenin ' ?
you really like her ?
sure , i like her .
i don' t see it .
what' s the attraction ?
i don' t know .
fills gaps , i guess .
what' s " gaps " ? i don' t know .
she' s got gaps . i got gaps .
together we fill gaps .
you ballin ' her ?
you don' t talk dirty about your sister .
are you screwin ' my sister ?
you see ?
that' s why i can' t connect you with gazzo .
because you got a big mouth .
you just talk too much . it' s cold in here . i' m goin ' home .
cold in here ? it is cold in here ! it stinks in here , and you stink !
you' re breakin ' the ribs .
if you do that to apollo creed , they' il put us in jail for murder .

what we' re going to do is ask you a few questions .

the reason we' re standing in this the meat guy' s stickin ' his face in .
let' s try it again , rocky .
today we' re here with heavyweight challenger rocky balboa .
the reason we' re standing in this refrigerated box ... is that mr. balboa has an unusual method of training . in a moment , he' il demonstrate that for the viewing audience at home .
but first , rocky , how did you come to train in an icebox ?
uh , well , uh , my friend , the guy over there ... he let me in one day , and i hit the beef here and liked it ... and since i' ve become a challenger , the owner don' t mind that i come in . is this a common training method ?
do other fighters pound raw meat ?
naw , i think i invented it .
would you give us a demonstration ?
confirm the reservation ... for my people at ringside , and fly my barber to philly .
how much is being channeled into west coast closed circuit advertising ?
300, 000 .
make it 450 .
and send the mayor' s wife 200 roses from me ... and make sure we get a picture of it for all the newspapers .
do you want to run the 1 5 radio spots in the midwest ?
you can spend your money better in canadian publicity .

george , i like your friends .
hey , champ .
you oughta come look at this boy you' re gonna fight on tv .

and he called the reporters ?
yeah .
threw my training schedule off .
don' t be mad at him .
he' s tryin ' to help .
adrian , i ain' t mad ... it' s just that when reporters are around , i get outta joint ...
' cause they take cheap shots , and paulie knows that .
and paulie keeps askin ' me for a job all the time ... but he don' t know nothin ' about fightin ' .
are you gonna say anything to him ?
what' s to say ? i just don' t know what he wants from me .
i don' t want nothin ' from you .
i don' t want nothin ' from you .
this ain' t no charity case .
get outta my house . it' s not just your house .
you' re no friend no more .
get outta my house , i just says .
don' t talk to him like that .
both of you get outta my house !
it' s cold outside , paulie .
i don' t want you messin ' her ... and i don' t raise you to go with this scum bum !
yeah ?
come on !
you wanna hit on me ?
come on ! i' il break both your arms so they don' t work for you .
stop it ! i' m not good enough to meet with gazzo ?
that' s what i think of gazzo !
now you' re a big shot fighter , you don' t even throw a crumb to your friend .
when i go and get your meat every mornin ' !
you forgot that ?
and then i even give you my sister too !
only a pig would say that ! i' m a pig ?
a pig gets you the best ?

you can' t live by yourself ! i put you two together , and don' t you forget it !

you' re supposed to be good to me !
what do i owe you , paulie ? i treat you good ! i cook for you , i clean for you , i pick up your dirty clothes ! i take care of you , paulie ! i don' t owe you nothin ' !
and you made me feel like a loser !
i' m not a loser !
you' re busted !

you let a man take down your pants !
she' s busted !
i can' t haul meat no more !
you want a roommate ?

you' re gonna become a very dangerous person .

paulie gets three grand . i get the robe .
shrewd .
the story about tonight' s fight , their difference in style ... you can quote a recent sports magazine which said ... it could be " the caveman against the cavalier . " i notice a buzzing in the background .
could be the challenger is getting ready to get into the ring .
rocky , look at my date .
cost me $200 .
250 . i gotta go . i gotta work .
how' s the robe ?
a little baggy .
a 50 to 1 underdog living a cinderella story ... and he' s captured people' s imaginations all over the world .
we love you , rocky !
good luck , champ .
thanks for showing up .
and his record , 44 victories .
he' s had 38 by knockout , and he' s lost 20 fights .
which makes me wonder , can he stand it ?
you know , the stamina and the skill to last three rounds .
because las vegas odds say no .
rocky balboa , climbing into the ring now .
the italian stallion .
some meat sign on the back of his robe .

shamrock meat

they have spotlights . i see right back there . is that the world heavyweight champion , apollo creed ?
he' s riding in a boat . is he supposed to be george washington ?
obviously so .
he' s got the hat on , the whole thing .
the world champion , apollo creed ... is doing an imitation of george washington .
he' s throwing money .
