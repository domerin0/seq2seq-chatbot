my son , our family owes a lot to the cyclo taxi
we work hard , day and night
eating and sleeping in the street .
pedalling all the time
some mornings , the backaches nail you to the bed
i don' t know where it all leads
this has been my life
when i die , i' il have nothing to leave you
if you can , see if you can find something more worthy

we shouldn' t .
the scale isn' t ours
yes we can , we' ve waited long enough
no one has claimed it
your shoulder' s hurting
you can' t keep pumping tires
let' s wait a while
on the old riverbanks leaves and flowers fade
the sun dies , icy , shuddering
hesitant , i cross the hamlet
my childhood , i remember you
i remember your graceful silhouette
you gazed at me , radiant , tender
i remember the sun was setting
on your ivory cheeks your rippling hair
put him to bed
tomorrow , i' il come see if you' re dead or not
get up , little brother
go wash up
ifl , the heron , die by boiling
may it be in clear water
to ease my children' s suffering
follow them
and not a word to anyone
bom has a fan made of palm leaves
the rich man says , i' il trade you
three cows and nine buffalo
i don' t want your buffalo
i' il give you a pond full of fish
i don' t want your fish
i' il give you a raft of precious wood
i don' t want your wood
i' il give you a bird ...
tomorrow , come to the icehouse
i' il tell you what to do
go now and be discreet

nameless river
i was born sobbing
blue sky , vast earth
black stream water
i grow with the months , the years
with no one to watch over me
nameless is man
nameless is the river
colorless the flower
perfume
without a voice
o , river i o , passer by i
in the closed cycle
of the months , the years
i can' t forget my debt to my roots
and i wander
through worlds
towards my land ...
his father won' t let me work
i' m bored
i' m going round in circles
so i busy myself with small tasks
is papa well ?
he just came home
when he leaves , i feel so alone

does it still happen ?
yes .
sometimes
i' il show you a photo
what are you looking for ?

what are you looking for ?
he was five years old
stay and eat with us
mama ...
no , he won' t let me
we were starving ...
no rice ...
people dying everywhere ...
we loved each other deeply
at 16 , or 17
we drank alcohol
to forget our hunger
a bit of shrimp paste ... on the end of a nail ... and we drank ...
it lasted a year ...
then the child was born
he came out backwards
too late ... almost dead
the doctor said " abnormal
coward .
he was a coward
the father left us
why coward ?
he was only 17
younger than his son is now
and then ...
how much for a bottle of gasoline ?
5, 000

ln 1956
i was 17 a bullet cut the nerve my hand stiffened up
and look at this ...
a bullet , through the neck
it came out the back

and then this here in 57 , a bullet shattered my shin

i know what you' re thinking faced with death
i understand you so well
autumn wind blows

i' il watch over you
until the night is over i' il watch over you

sleep , my child , my beloved
my little one
