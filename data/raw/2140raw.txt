detective sipowicz , tell the court how you arrested mr. giardella .
this past august 27 , i was surveilling the defendant , as he is a known felon .
during the surveillance i observed the defendant' s car having a flat tire .
he got out and opened the trunk .
i approached the car , identified myself as a police officer . . . . . . and through casual observation i saw 27 cartons of cigarettes . . . . . . which did not have tax stamps .
i ascertained it was his car , gave him his rights and took him into custody .
nothing further , your honor .
detective sipowicz . . .
. . . you testified that the cigarettes for which you arrested my client . . . . . . were in plain sight in his trunk when he opened it to get out a jack ?
right .
now . . . . . . there were seven nails in mr. giardella' s right rear radial .
that wouldn' t exactly produce a slow leak .
yet you say , during several hours of antecedent surveillance . . . . . . you saw no one damage his tire .
i was surveilling mr. giardella , not his car .
he stopped at niglio' s coffeehouse .
maybe some urban youths did mischief to his vehicle during that time frame .
your honor , justified or not . . . . . . the reputation of the neighborhood around niglio' s coffeehouse . . . . . . is such that urban youths do not tend to do mischief in its environs .
maybe he drove past a construction site .
however , sipowicz here has a vendetta against mr. giardella .
i submit the true scenario is that while my client stopped at niglio' s . . . . . . sipowicz hammered nails into his tire to cause a flat . . . . . . so when mr. giardella stopped to get out a spare . . . . . . he could circumvent probable cause statutes . . . . . . and go fishing inside mr. giardella' s trunk .
move to suppress the evidence as tainted and dismiss the complaint .
granted .
and the construction site theory ?
pathetic .
adjourned .
that a dead rat on your head ?
hey , hey , hey , hey .
make some bad wig jokes .
meanwhile , i' m walking out the door .
you clear $90 a day ?
here , go buy some clean socks .
i' m gonna burn you down , smalltimer .
come on .
lay off .
no , that hump rubs me the wrong way .
i' il make his life miserable .
and bury your career .
they already held that service , john .
andy . . . .
ms. district attorney , you prosecuted the crap out of that one .
i went with the crap i had .
are you saying i queered his tire ?
i' d say , " res ipsa loquitur , " if i thought you knew what it meant .
hey , " ipsa " this , you pissy little bitch .
pilot
hey , guys .
how you doing , detective ?
good morning .
morning .
detective kelly .
hey , sarge .
thank you .
where' s sipowicz ?
lieutenant .
he' s on an errand .
my office .
i heard he flipped out in court .
you need to think about a new partner .
lieutenant , i know sipowicz is messing up , but he' s gonna come out of it .
i realize how you feel about him .
both of us know where he is .
and it' s not running an errand .
he' s at patrick' s , getting loaded .
andy was a great cop .
now he' s a drunk that won' t help himself .
i' m taking him off the street .
don' t do that yet .
let me talk to him .
let me see if i can shake him up .
that asshole , giardella .
he can wear all the $ 1 000 suits he wants , i' m not impressed .
i popped him when he rolled drunks in the park , and he knows i did .
you know where he' s gonna be tonight ?
the best table at gianinni' s .
you' re damn right .
telling a broad how his lawyer made me look like a jerk .
leon , hurt me twice .
this has gotta stop , andy .
what' s gotta stop ?
you' re getting stiff every afternoon .
i don' t recall requesting any career counseling from you .
when was the last time you tried going on the wagon ?
when was the last time you tried growing tits ?
let' s talk in the morning .
no , let' s talk now .
okay .
i think we should call it quits .
meaning what ?
meaning us being partners .
yeah , sure .
get bored at home , you dump your wife .
problems at work , dump your partner .
i didn' t dump her , she dumped me .
and secondly , i' ve been carrying you .
we both know it .
every cop in the station knows it .
and i' m sick of it .
all right , you wanna split up ?
that' s no problem .
that' s no problem at all .
get your hands off of me !
let' s go somewhere . . . .
get your hands off of me !
let' s go get something to eat .
i can' t .
i' m on rug patrol tonight .
andy , come here .

or so help me , i' il clean your clock .
let me take care of this .
yeah , sure .
hey , ramon .
hi , detective .
she just went in .
what' s with the shiner ?
punks jumped me in the basement .
anybody report it ?
what am i gonna report ?
i just gave them the $46 .
if you don' t report it , i can' t do anything about it .
i' il send a sector car over .
you should move back into the building .
hey .
i brought dinner .
where' s the separation forms , johnny ?
you know what ?
i lost them .
you lost them ?
i looked all over .
we' il use yours .
we each need to fill out assets .
i lost a form , laura .
you want me to hang myself ?
so am i dismissed ?

ramon got mugged in the laundry room ?
last tuesday .
when was i gonna hear about it ?
i just found out yesterday .
don' t go down there at night .
i' ve been going to the laundromat .
how' s work ?
you' il let them put up that building ?
we' re still negotiating the variance .
thank you .
" how' s work , john ?
i' d ask if i wanted to know .
we are splitting up .
you do not have to hate the job anymore , okay ?
just because we' re splitting doesn' t mean i' il stop worrying about you .
good .
hey , come here .
sure we' re doing the right thing ?
i' m sure .
a lot of people stay together behind less than what we got going .
that' s not good enough .
i don' t wanna have this conversation every time you get horny .
my mistake .
i just think it would be easier . . . . . . if we made a clean break .
okay .
we both have feelings for each other .
right .
so i think it would be easier if we just left each other alone .
lot of good this is going to do .
you' re an easy guy to find , alfonse .
thursdays at gianinni' s .
what are you doing here ?
am i interrupting ?

did you know he shot a cop ?
you didn' t know , did you ?
he works for you and didn' t get your permission , did he ?
who raised you to have such a big mouth ?
let' s go , pal .
yeah .
tell giardella that john kelly wants to see him .
okay ?
no hands .
john kelly .
sipowicz' s condition is extremely critical .
he' s bleeding too badly for them to finish operating .
the front desk will have word of any change .
we' re coordinating with port authority p. d. . . . . . monitoring all bus , rail and air terminals for the prostitute .
meadows and wong are canvassing a neighborhood for any witnesses .
sager and french are on patrick' s bar .
i' m handling forensics .
you' re all green lighted for any necessary overtime .
this is lnspector lastarza of the organized crime unit .
gentlemen , ladies , be assured that as you investigate this shooting . . . . . . you will receive any intelligence and assistance my force can provide .
since task force operations are ongoing and involve individuals . . . . . . who will fall within your investigation . . . . . . it' s imperative you notify us of your activities .
a costly incident has just occurred as a result of a failure to so notify .
i urge you all to avoid a repetition .
good luck .
kelly ?
see me .
you killed a surveillance mike .
where ?
at the social club , doing your john wayne act for marino .
i put a guy off me .
yeah , into the thermostat . . . . . . and our mike , which is no longer transmitting .
my partner got shot .
i could care about your mike .
i' m hooked into this crime family .
i' ve got two years and 20, 000 man hours on the line .
i' m not gonna jeopardize that for one victim . . . . . . cop or no cop , partner or no partner .
your officer' s emotionally involved .
he' s out of policy .
he' s got no business anywhere near this case .
is he right ?
that i' m emotionally involved ?
yeah .
no , about you being out of control ?
where' s this going ?
sit down and make a list of possible suspects .
people he busted , pissed off .
that' s a waste of time .
so is looking for lois .
she' s out of town or out of air .
are you gonna do what i ask ?
you want a suspect list , lieutenant ?
you got one .
your wife' s downstairs .
oh , god .
i blew that 3 : 00 .
this is inconsiderate , even for you .
it' s two subway rides for us .
for you , it' s across the street .
yeah , i' m sorry .
you inconvenienced us .
are you done impressing her ?
he' s helping us , so lose the macho
andy got shot a couple hours ago .
oh , my god .
so , i' m sorry , but we' re gonna have to do the paperwork another time .
okay ?
hi .
hey .
sorry about sipowicz .
yeah .
if you go to the hospital  he might not live that long .
if you want someone to ride over with or just get a beer . . . ?
thanks .
i' il let you know .
fifteenth precinct .
martinez .
hey , juanito . . . .
your list of suspects .
is this a joke ?
one name ?
alfonse giardella set him up and shot him .
there are no other suspects .
it would only take about 15 minutes .
you wanna get in some trouble ?
i' m up for that .
i gotta go .
come on .
police !
hey . . . .
here we go .
come on .
everyone , zip up , wipe their hands off and get against the wall .
that' s it , come on .
angelo marino .
thank him .
call him !
come on .
yeah , come on , come on .
call him when you wanna be bailed out .
thank him for the bust .
delivery .
post time .
police .
you are under arrest .
get against the wall .
tell marino you got popped . . . . . . because he can' t control his people .
this is for giardella shooting a cop .
spread .
waste your time , running like that .
you' re never gonna get away from me .
martinez , you' ve got moves out there .
i escaped a lot as a youth .
come here , kelly .
put them right there .
i want my lawyer .
from the left to the right .
what are you doing ?
bleeding marino to give up giardella .
if he gives him up dead ?
that' s okay too .
i have four messages from lastarza .
i won' t be able to protect you .
i understand .
officer licalsi .
you wanna get that beer ?
sure .
here you go .
was sipowicz your first partner ?
since i got my shield .
he' s tough , huh ?
he' s still hanging on .
i' ve been afraid to go over there .
my dad died there when i was a kid .
how' d he die ?
he was a cop .
oh .
went through the wrong door .
i' m sorry .
my dad' s a cop too .
oh , yeah ?
whereabouts ?
uptown .
the 27 .
my folks live in staten lsland now .
they must be proud of you .
hope so .
you didn' t have to be at the hospital .
you were with sipowicz when it mattered .
i don' t know .
we got into a beef right before he went after giardella .
i halfway think that' s why he did it .
i know that' s not why he got shot .
it just seems that no matter how much you feel about someone . . . . . . you never really get it squared away .
you never really get to understand them the way you wanted .
is that how it was with your wife ?
no , she blamed the job .
said i was in the street too much .
maybe she didn' t meet you halfway .
maybe she didn' t know how to listen .
probably enough blame to go around there , right ?
you wanna get some dinner ?
yeah .
yeah ?
may i take these ?
thank you .
what do you wanna be doing in a couple of years ?
what you' re doing now .
i want my shield .
i heard you got yours at 28 .
yep , i was lucky .
so , what do we do now ?
that depends on you .
you' re up front .
i don' t count on second chances .
am i weird if i' m not really sure what i wanna do ?
you' re not weird .
i never cheated when i was married .
really ?
that' s right .
well , why don' t we just play it by ear ?
where are we playing ?
oh , you are here .
hi .
your phone' s off the hook .
is that right ?
is there any news about andy ?
no , he' s the same .
sorry i messed up on the papers .
no , that' s the last thing you should' ve been thinking about .
can i come in ?
i got some company .
well , you' re all broken up about andy , aren' t you , john ?
let' s do what we came here to do .
i' m counsel to alfonse giardella .
he' s wanted for questioning in the sipowicz shooting .
he rousts me , and i' m harassed when he' s whacked .
he ain' t dead yet .
i don' t give a damn about your buddy .
i was playing cards .
he here for a statement ?
that' s right .
interview one .
come on , come on .
i know what you' re trying to do , and it' s not gonna work .
what i think would be useful is if maybe you traced your activities . . . . . . starting 8 : 00 yesterday morning .
i' m gonna trace myself .
i just wanna tell this douche bag he' s barking up the wrong tree .
sit down , fatso .
i was on my way to atlantic city .
i got a condo there .
i arrived and went to several casinos , where i lost money at blackjack .
it' s all on the cameras .
check it out .
back at my condo , i got a call that you were looking for me .
this was maybe 9 : 00 last night , and i drove back up this morning .
questions , gentlemen ?
yeah .
when did you get to the casino yesterday ?
about 4 : 00 .
that' s three hours after he was shot .
that' s when i arrived .
he' s suddenly talking ?
he' s making accusations ?
i was accompanied the whole drive .
people can testify to that .
i don' t care what he says in his mind .
screw him .
and screw you guys .
none of this is gonna work .
angelo marino trusts me .
i should thank you , detective .
for what ?
this crackdown of yours has made my year .
my card , if you need to be in touch .
shove it , counselor .
take the card .
look at the address on the back .
it' s a restaurant i recommend .
hey , jimmy , come on , let' s go !
your party' s here , mr. marino .
excuse me , i gotta look for a wire .
hey , you got me .
pager unit .
it' s okay , lou .
you mind if i hold it ?
no .
enjoy your meal .
you want something to eat , drink ?
no .
this crap in the street has to stop .
give me giardella .
we' re not talking about alfonse giardella .
i' il take care of it myself .
we' re talking about you and me .
i' m sitting here politely .
i' m offering you a meal .
and i' m telling you , either cut this out or we got a serious problem .
he whacked my partner and i want him .
the problem' s mine to take care of .
now , sometimes people get justice without getting time .
not good enough !
you punk .
you' re gonna tell me what' s good enough ?
you' re gonna tell me how to run my business and embarrass me in public ?
you think you can' t get hurt ?
you know what to do .
you gonna keep this up , aren' t you ?
till he' s mine .
this thing' s going off .
what happened ?
i was on my way home .
your ex wife , she' s fine .
she knows who got mugged .
he didn' t want to give up his wallet .
i can walk .
watch it .
i' m on the job .
give me the description of this guy .
you okay , 4b ?
yeah .
guess as a fighter , i make a great lawyer .
my nose broken ?
i wouldn' t be surprised .
this is an excuse to get it fixed .
i' il meet you in the emergency room .
no , that' s really not necessary .
you see anything ?
no , not until he came in the door .
maybe you go over to your mother' s until i get this guy .
i didn' t have a right to do that last night or talk to you like that .
it' s all right .
it isn' t .
you have a right to have company the same way i do .
i' m having a hard time without you .
we' il feel our way through it .
i' m gonna go to the hospital .
where are they taking him ?
queens general .
nothing new on andy ?
no .
take care of yourself , all right ?
see you , john .
she' s okay ?
yeah .
hey , thanks for stopping .
no problem .
what about us ?
we' re fine .
i' il call you later .
okay .
all right ?
take care , all right ?
i will .
mr. marino , you wanted to see me ?
this guy won' t hear reason .
is that your impression . . . . . . that kelly won' t back off ?
i' m not sure .
he' s upset about his partner .
not sure ?
you' re screwing the guy and you' re not sure ?
all right .
i want you to kill him .
how am i gonna do that ?
you' re a cop .
you' il figure something out .
i' m sorry i didn' t get here till now , buddy .
i had a bad experience here , you know .
my dad and . . . .
you know about that .
i don' t know
i don' t know if you can hear me or what , i don' t know .
i don' t know what' s going on in your head .
but , um . . . .
but i' m sorry .
i wish i could' ve helped you more .
i just . . . .
i' m grateful for the way you treated me . . . . . . on coming up and . . . .
you' re like a father to me , man .
