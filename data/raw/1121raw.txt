we didn' t find out about it till this morning .
i don' t know .
it was peezee .
gotta be .
he hates your fucking guts .
i don' t know .
what is so hard to understand here ?
you said peezee was a mamaluke and couldn' t be trusted .
now all of a sudden you got a soft spot for this guy .
i just don' t think it was him .
okay , i' il buy it .
if not peezee , then who ?

i think it was you , ducks .
you gotta be kidding .

caesar .
caesar !
this is garbage .

what' s up ?
i don' t know .
anyway , thanks for looking out for me , paul .
i' il see you around .
sure .
isaac sobel was a man of rigorous belief and unflinching honesty .
a patriarch with an almost biblical sense of integrity and conviction .
a man of faith and courage , of spirit and humor .
a rock and a tree .
a good friend who will be deeply missed .
i' d like to call on isaac' s son , dr. ben sobel , who would like to say a few words .
it' s not easy for me to talk about my father ... ... because , in a sense , i' m talking about two people .
one is the public isaac sobel ... ... the eminent psychotherapist ... ... and popular author known to millions of readers across the world .
the second is the private man .
my father .
dad .
and for those of you who knew him well ... ... and know our family , well , i don' t have to tell you .
he was a psychotic , mind fucking prick .
an arrogant , ego inflated son of a bitch .
i wish you were alive so i could kill you .
rot in hell !
now i' d like to call on isaac' s son , dr. ben sobel ... ... who would like to say a few words .
who the hell would have a cell phone in here ?
it' s yours .
answer it before they notice .
hello ?
guess who , you fuck ?
i have to take this .
what ?
i' m sorry .
it' s mine .
i have to take this .
yes ?
i left three fucking messages .
you don' t call me back ?
this is not a good time .
not a good time ?
let me explain something , i' m in fucking hell right now .
this is not a good time .
this is a very bad time .
my father died .
get off .
i have to go .
don' t you hang up on me , you ...
call back .
they' re trying to kill me .
hey , fredo .
yeah , you , guido .
come over here .
i' ve got something to show you .
you' re a dead man .
385 , mess hall .
thanks , lorenzo .
thank you .
i can' t believe he' s gone .
i can' t believe what you said .
cold and withholding " ?
you had to tell everybody ?
why didn' t you take a swing at the casket ?
i might have strayed from my notes a little bit .
i' m grieving .
it' s a big loss , and grief is a process .
mr. and mrs. sobel , your housekeeper let us in .
i' m agent miller , this is special agent cerrone .
federal bureau of investigation .
we' d like to ask you a few questions .
can i ask what this is about ?
we' ve just come from a funeral .
we know this is a difficult time for you .
it will only take a minute .
sure , sit down .
sorry about your father .
thank you very much .
it' s very , very difficult .
i' m gonna miss him terribly .
i mean , there were issues , like there are in any father and son relationship .
he wasn' t a very warm man .
ben .
yeah ?
once today .
enough .
okay .
no , i' m just saying that even so , he was a ... ... great , great legs ...
man .
dr. sobel , you received a call this morning from paul vitti .
why would you say that i got a call from paul vitti ?
because we monitor all his phone calls from sing sing .
then , yes , i did .
that was him ?
on the phone ?
yes .
why didn' t you tell me ?
well , talk about withholding .
michael .
you told her at the drop of a hat .
well , she' s in the fbl .
she needs to know this information .
okay , i see , and i don' t .
i don' t need to know these things .
no , don' t tell laura .
she can' t possibly handle a phone call .
did i say that ?
did i say that ?
you folks need a minute ?
no , we' re fine .
yeah , we' re phenomenal .
listen , i' m gonna go to the kitchen .
pants suit .
she' s grieving .
you know , it' s a process .
vitti ?
we were involved in some organized crime activity a few years ago .
i mean , i wasn' t , you know , " involved .
he was involved .
but i was treating him therapeutically at the time ... ... and then some people tried to kill us .
it was really nothing .
shortly after you two spoke , he seemed to have some kind of breakdown .
really ?
what kind of breakdown ?
i think you had better go up there and see for yourself .
i' m treating him with thorazine .
300 milligrams , b . i . d .
seems to keep him pretty calm .
that would keep the middle east pretty calm .
and he just keeps singing west side story songs ?
tonight . " " maria . " the balcony scene .
you should get him to do " officer krupke .
it' s really good .
paul ?
maria ?
paul , it' s me .
dr. sobel .
maria ?
tony ?
maria !
oh , maria !
oh , my god !
thank god you' ve come !
yes .
you' ve got to get me out of here !
okay .
do you promise ?
i promise .
te adoro .
te adoro .
this is how it' s been .
he sings for a while , then he goes completely catatonic .
and you did a neurological workup ?
yeah .
no tumors , no seizures , no sign of stroke .
paul ?
if you' re faking , paul , i' m gonna know .
when i was a resident , we used to play with the catatonics .
well , i don' t think he' s faking .
i don' t think he' s smart enough .
street smart , yeah ... ... but we' re talking about an iq just north of a bedroom slipper .
so if he is truly ... ... catatonic , if i stuck him with this needle ...
this is just plain saline , isn' t it ?
yeah .
yeah .
then he shouldn' t feel a thing .
right ?
that' s gotta hurt .
no reaction at all .
i want to do some neuropsychological testing , okay ?
sure .
paul , i' m gonna give you some tests to assess your mental condition , okay ?
now , do i have your consent to share the results of the tests ?
mommy is mad at me because i made a boom on the rug .
i' m gonna take that as a yes .
good .
okay .
paul , i have 10 cards , each with a picture of an inkblot on it , okay ?
here' s the first card .
now look at it , and tell me what you see .
i see a bat .
a bat or a weasel .
a bat or a weasel ?
yeah .
bat .
bat weasel .
do you see anything else ?
just a pussy with teeth .
pussy with teeth .
yeah .
next card .
excellent , paul .
one hour and 12 minutes .
i want you to take a look at this picture and tell me what' s happening .
i think we got a picture of a guy , nice , hardworking fella .
comes home , sees his wife is in bed with a midget ... ... and she' s been fucking him while he' s out of town .
so she' s having intercourse ... ?
with a midget .
very good .
it doesn' t matter who they know downtown .
tell them they got no leverage .
mr. chapin ?
come in .
come in .
all right .
hi , i' m dr. ben sobel .
hi .
thanks for coming in .
i appreciate it .
my pleasure .
so , what have we got ?
okay ...
based on his symptoms and his test results , i would call it brief psychotic disorder ... ... and if it persists , schizophreniform disorder .
and dr. kassam , the psychiatrist at sing sing , concurs with the diagnosis .
so he' s crazy .
not crazy .
no .
at least not permanently .
see , in certain people , prolonged exposure to extremely stressful situations ... ... like soldiers in combat , for instance , or disaster victims or hostages ... ... can produce a temporary psychotic state .
how temporary ?
a day , a week , a month ... ... if the precipitating stresses are removed .
which means he' s not gonna get better as long as he' s in the can .
he could conceivably get worse .
right now he thinks somebody is trying to kill him .
and he could deteriorate to the point where he' s permanently schizophrenic .
then he' s got a real problem .
he goes before the parole board in four weeks .
would they actually release him ?
oh , yeah .
i' m sure they' il want to release a major mafia figure ... ... who' s now certifiably deranged on top of it .
why don' t they release him to a halfway house ... ... or a center where he can get the care he needs ?
based on my earlier work with him , i don' t think he' s dangerous ... ... and i think he' s making a strong effort to reform himself .
okay ... ... i' il tell you what i' m gonna do .
i' m gonna release him into your custody .
mine ?
oh , no .
no , i couldn' t ...
no .
no .
no .
mr. chapin , thank you , anyway , but this is a very bad time for me .
see , my father just died .
i' m sorry .
and i' m grieving .
it' s a process .
and i have a bulging disk in my neck .
and i have this burning sensation when i urinate ...
yeah , i' ve had that too .
we' re redecorating , which is a nightmare .
you wanna see him killed in prison ?
no .
or sent to a facility for the criminally insane ?
of course not .
then he' s all yours .
i told my son we couldn' t have a dog .
i' m gonna bring home paul vitti ?
i' m gonna talk to the bureau of prisons ... ... and get you certified as a temporary federal institution .
i can' t be an institution .
i work in the suburbs .
i handle neurotic soccer moms and alcoholic gentiles ...
you have got 30 days to get him into shape for his parole hearing .
that means sane , sober and gainfully employed .
now i' m warning you , doctor .
if he screws up in any way , if he flees ... ... or if i find out this was a setup to get him on the street ... ... i will hold you totally responsible .
and you will pay dearly .
you' il be stripped of your license and prosecuted to the full extent of the law .
are we clear ?
yes .
do you want him or not ?
yes .
good choice .
we' il be in touch .
tony .
hi , how are you ?
you okay ?
doctor , sign here and here , please .
okay .
okay , thank you very much .
you fucking piece of shit !
i tell you someone is trying to kill me and you hang up on me ? !
i knew it .
i knew it !
you faked !
you stuck me with a fucking needle !
you used me to get you out of prison .
it took you long enough .
i' m singing west side story for three days .
i' m half a fag already .
what were you doing ?
i was in a funeral home !
what' s that got to do with somebody trying to kill me ?
you' re my doctor !
my father died .
so ?
with you , it' s always , " me , me , me .
he' s dead , so get over it .
that' s life .
are you hearing this ?
are you hearing you ?
i' m deeply sorry for your loss , okay ?
yeah , i can see how touched you are .
all right .
who' s after you ?
you tell me .
could be my old crew , could be the rigazzis , lou the wrench .
lou the wrench ?
why " the wrench " ?
the guy' s a maniac .
he twisted some guy' s head off once .
off ?
off .
totally off .
the feds are putting pressure on everybody .
all the families are fighting each other .
it' s like the fall of the roman empire .
wwill .
what does this have to do with you ?
they knew i was getting out .
the last thing they want to do is see me get into it .
just explain to them that you' re out of it now and you' re starting a new life .
that' s a really imaginative thought .
i wish i could have thought of that .
maybe they' d throw a party and give me a gold watch .
what , are you kidding me ?
believe me , nobody' s happy that i' m getting out .
nobody .
wanna grab your stuff ?
no .
jelly' s gonna pick me up in an hour .
i don' t think you understand .
you' re in my custody .
you stay here .
therapy every day .
you can' t leave without permission .
you gotta be kidding me .
are you coming in , or do i have to make a phone call ?
some fucking life this is gonna be .
get my bags .
do you really think he' s crazy ?
don' t you wanna get a second opinion ?
if he thinks i think he' s crazy , he' s crazier than i think he is .
locked up , he' s of absolutely no use to us .
but back on the street , vitti has enough juice to be a threat to both families .
it' s like throwing gasoline on a fire .
that' s if he goes back to his old life .
people like paul vitti don' t change .
he' s been a menace to society since he was 12 years old .
being a criminal is all he knows .
he' s gonna head straight back for trouble .
then all we have to do is sit back and pick up the pieces .
we need to stay on vitti .
how could you ?
how could you bring him here ?
that mobster in my house , eating off of my dishes .
it' s not like i had a lot of choice .
it' s a new law ?
you have to bring home a gangster ?
he' s in my custody .
i am a temporary federal institution .
why couldn' t he just go home ?
because his wife and his family are in ohio .
sure , yeah , everybody gets to go to ohio except me .
you wanna go to ohio ?
that' s not the ...
shut up !
his life was threatened .
he didn' t want to endanger his family .
how thoughtful .
but it' s okay to endanger our family ?
i know this is a terrible imposition , but it' s not like i wanted him here .
well , you didn' t want him , and i didn' t want him , but here he is .
here he is .
hey , you .
coffee ?
what ?
somebody said something about coffee .
yeah , that was you .
you said you wanted some .
so , what' s the holdup ?
ben , why don' t you make your friend some coffee .
i' m gonna take a long bath .
and hopefully drown .
excuse her , usually she is a wonderful hostess ... ... but she' s grieving .
it' s a process .
hey , doc , listen .
i got a friend coming over , so i don' t want you to be surprised .
what kind of friend ?
because if it' s the wrench , or the pliers ...
no , it' s a personal thing , you know ?
oh , yeah ?
they won' t be staying late , will they ?
are you that fucking pussy whipped ?
i' m not ...
this has nothing to do with laura .
i just heard her busting your balls .
we were having a disagreement , yes .
but some conflict is normal in a marriage .
or ?
or what ?
you' re pussy whipped .
paul , i am not ...
when the coffee' s ready , i' il be upstairs .
good night , whippy .
forty minutes .
how long are you gonna let them go on ?
let them ?
how much longer can they go on ?
another five minutes , i' il break it up or i' il call the guinness book of records .
oh , god .
oh , god .
give me a break .
she' s faking .
what ?
nobody sounds like that .
oh , yeah .
oh , god .
oh , god !
come on , nobody sounds like that .
i don' t know .
" i don' t know .
yeah ?
paul , i have to talk to you .
what' s up ?
i have to talk to you .
talk later ?
now .
hold on .
yeah ?
i have a 17 year old son .
i' il ask her .
that' s not what i' m talking about .
i need to speak to you .
actually , i' m right in the middle of somebody .
can' t you see ?
paul , now .
and , miss , there' s no smoking in my house .
thank you .
okay , paul , what do you think you' re doing ?
minding my own business , like you should be doing .
that' s difficult to do with the vagina monologues in the guest room .
i been in the can for two and a half years .
what am i supposed to do ?
go to a hotel .
that' s what i wanted .
you told me i can' t .
you said it' s either here or sing sing .
i' m not trying to punish you , but i do have some responsibilities .
i thought you might appreciate a nice home cooked meal after being in prison .
yeah , that' s what i' ve been jerking off to for the last 850 nights in a row .
a fucking home cooked meal .
tuna casserole !
all right , paul ?
doc ?
the girl' s gotta go .
the girl ?
you know , i bet you' re jealous .
yes , i' m very ...
and what might i be jealous of ?
i didn' t hear nothing out of your room .
we don' t think it' s necessary to wake the neighbors every time we have sex .
if you' re quiet , you could do it without even waking your wife .
paul , that is not funny .
what is that ?
i told her if i wasn' t back in two minutes to start without me .
i gotta go .
this is not a good start .
it was for me till you knocked on my door .
here , aunt esther .
thank you .
and again , i' m so sorry we had to put you up at a hotel .
we would' ve loved to have you stay with us , but we had an unexpected houseguest .
his father always had room for us .
don' t say that to me .
shut up .
you go to hell !
i am so out of here !
go on , get out of here , you fucking pain in the ass !
you crazy pain in the ass !
get the fuck out of here !
go ahead , go back to turning tricks in hoboken , you pain in the ass !
how' s it going ?
food .
paul ?
paul , what are you doing ?
hey , doc .
i' m just looking for something to eat over here .
this all you got ?
who do you have to fuck to get some bacon around here ?
not you , i hope .
he' s new in town .
let' s go in the office , i' il make you a plate .
what' s in the office ?
we' re gonna go to the office and talk first .
hey , doc , what' s up with your family ?
they tend to overreact a little .
i know .
all you did was flash everybody in the dining room .
by the look of some of them broads , they ain' t seen the old salsicc ' for a long time .
it' s good for them .
good for them ?
well , when the paramedics revive my aunt golda , i' il be sure to ask her , okay ?
sit down .
so ...
paul , do you mind ?
i think we' ve seen enough of the old salsicc ' for one day .
thank you .
so , what are you gonna do , paul ?
i' m gonna find out who' s trying to kill me .
i' m a target .
they could shoot through that window and blow my fucking head off .
then what ?
so i gotta deal with that .
that would be a priority , i understand that .
i' m talking about a job , work .
there' s gotta be something that you like to do .
i like hitting guys over the head with a baseball bat .
that' s good .
so sporting goods .
yeah , exactly .
that' s interesting .
so who are you ?
who am i ?
i just wanna know how you see yourself .
i' m paul vitti .
i' m the boss .
the boss of what ?
the boss of jelly ?
because you' re not the boss of me .
so , what are you the boss of ?
i see what you' re doing , you .
i see .
i get it .
what am i doing ?
you' re pissing me off .
that' s what .
look at me .
i' m starting to get anxious .
it' s very understandable that you' re anxious .
i mean , you spent your whole life becoming something that you were ... ... and now you can' t be that anymore , so it' s scary .
i mean , if you' re not paul vitti " the boss , " who are you ?
let me ask you this way .
when you were a kid , what did you want to be ?
i was a kid .
who remembers that shit ?
but you had to want to be something .
did you want to be a baseball player ?
no .
a fireman ?
an astronaut .
come on , what did you wanna be ?
it was stupid .
it' s not stupid .
what , are you afraid to tell me ?
yeah , i' m afraid .
so tell me .
i' m not here to judge you .
what did you want to be ?
there was one time when i was about ... ... maybe 6 , 6 and a half , 7 .
right in there .
right in that time .
i thought that i wanted to be a ...
i wanted to be a ...
for a second ...
you know , a little kid .
what ?
maybe ...
i was a kid , you know ?
little kid .
what ?
tell me .
i wanted to be a cowboy .
a cowboy , really ?
would you believe that ?
well , that' s interesting .
how did that start ?
i was watching television with my mother , father .
you know , we watched those cowboy shows .
and my ...
my father got me the whole outfit .
he got me a 10 gallon white hat ... ... the boots , the spurs , the cap guns ... ... the whole bit .
then he took me upstate to my uncle' s farm and led me around on this little pony .
and there was cows and all that stuff .
it was like , to me , the wild west .
and it was all " yippee kai ay " and all that stuff .
you happy now ?
so , what happened ?
i don' t know .
what happened ?
why didn' t you try to be a cowboy ?
i was in east harlem .
i joined a street gang when i was 12 years old .
why didn' t i become a cowboy ?
something else happened when you were 12 that was very difficult for you .
yeah .
that' s when your father was murdered .
yeah , i think about it every day .
what' s that got to do with anything ?
it has a lot to do with things .
it' s very interesting because your father was the one who got you the white hat .
he was in the mob , but yet he wanted you to be a hero .
yeah , he did .
your father wanted you to have a better life than he did .
he did , yeah .
he wanted me to go to college .
i didn' t even go to high school , hardly .
that' s because he had died and he wasn' t around to guide you .
see , paul , before , you said , " i' m paul vitti , the boss " ... ... but when i look at you , i see paul vitti the 12 year old kid ... ... who' s scared and confused with a lot of hard choices to make .
you .
you .
you' re good , you .
no , paul ...
no , you' re good .
you' re better than good .
it' s just the beginning .
you' re real good .
you made me realize i' m a little fucking kid .
that' s all i wanted .
i never could figure it out with my father .
that' s great .
but you have to ...
it' s clear now .
new choices , new things .
new beginnings .
i' m ready .
i' m here , front and center .
let' s go .
there' s somebody that i work with .
he' s a career counselor .
he places people in jobs .
he' s excellent .
i' m ready .
sign me up .
i' m ready to go .
i' m ready to jump in with both feet .
that' s great .
i' m ready !
down !
that was not a good thing .
hi , doc .
jelly , what are you doing here ?
hey , doc .
it' s been a while .
i thought you were in prison .
it would appear not .
well , how did you get out ?
i had a new trial .
it turns out the evidence in my first trial was , you know , tainted .
i see .
anyway , two of the witnesses decided not to testify , and the third guy ... ... he committed suicide .
how ?
he stabbed himself in the back four times and threw himself off a bridge .
very unfortunate .
good to have you back .
we' re in a war , paul .
it' s not safe out there .
the rigazzis are walking all over us .
we need you , paul .
you know , sally , i' m out of it .
it' s over for me .
i don' t do this no more .
the family needs you .
what are you talking about ?
no one did the big jobs like you .
air france , they' re still talking about it .
paul , think about it .
for me ?
i' il think about it .
okay .
come on , what is this ?
a fucking funeral ?
you just got out of college , for chrissakes .
let' s have a party .
i' il have one drink , and then i gotta go see the boss .
yeah , what ?
" yeah , what ?
that' s how you answer the door , you ?
yeah , what ?
you got a problem with that ?
yeah , what ?
don' t bother getting up on our account .
paul , what a nice surprise .
yeah , patti , how' s it going ?
it' s good .
come here , you .
give me a kiss .
get over here .
come on , what did i do ?
what did i do that you' re mad at me ?
come on .
how are you , paul ?
all right .
you missed a spot .
you can' t be too careful .
hey , i know .
sorry to hear about carmine .
he was a good man .
yeah , i know .
you live with someone for 21 years .
then one day they pull his torso out of the river .
it' s hard .
yeah , i' il bet .
especially since the talk was that you were the one that put him there .
that' s why i try not to gossip .
it' s ugly .
yeah , it is .
just a sec .
michelle , theresa , it' s 10 : 30 .
stop fucking around and get ready for ballet !
it' s so hard being a single parent and a career woman .
for instance , a lot of people are saying now that you' re out ... ... that you' re gonna try and take the family from me .
i said , " no , paul would never do that to me .
never .
not me .
good .
so you look good .
what , have you been working out ?
yeah , i been working out who' s been trying to kill me .
got any ideas ?
it' s a dog eat dog world out there .
and you know nobody will be safe unless we end this thing with the rigazzis .
so you had nothing to do with it ?
paul , calm down , okay ?
i did not try and kill you .
all right ?
look , i want us to be friends , you know ?
who knows ?
maybe we' il be more than friends .
you wanna lick my beaters ?
patti , let' s get serious .
i wanna be left alone , okay ?
i' m not doing anything , i' m just taking care of my own self ... ... which is what i should always be doing , and that' s it .
sure , i understand , okay ?
you understand ?
i do .
i understand .
relax .
sit down , i' il make you a cup of coffee .
no , i gotta go .
i got a business thing with some guy .
if you get something going , we' d expect some kind of consideration .
a little taste .
no , this is a legitimate thing .
it' s different .
you gave me a chill .
yeah , well , you' il get over it .
give me a kiss .
come on , give me a kiss , you .
take care of yourself , huh ?
you too .
all right .
don' t be a stranger , paul .
yeah , i' il see you around .
watch him like a hawk .
it would break my heart , but if he steps out of line , shoot him in the fucking head .
it' il be my pleasure .
look at the size of that trunk .
you could put three bodies in there .
just kidding .
just trying to levitate the situation .
okay , thank you .
we appreciate it .
sure .
hey , what kind of car youse drive , anyway ?
it' s a lexus 430 ls .

thanks .
you want more bread ?
yeah .
bread .
there you go .
i' il get your drinks now .
this stone is supposed to be a g color .
it looks a little yellow , doesn' t it ?
that' s the fluorescent light .
it makes everything look yellow .
no , i thought fluorescent light makes everything look blue .
what am i , edison ?
that' s a fuck ...
it' s the fluorescent light doing that .
that' s a g.
well , maybe .
look from that angle .
what do you think ?
i don' t ...
i don' t know .
it' s a little ...
yeah .
could we look at it with a lens ?
that might help us out .
do you have a lens ?
we just asked for a lens .
where do you think you' re going ?
where am i going ?
the orphanage found my real parents .
i' m going to jelly' s house .
no , you' re not .
you' re in my custody .
and we have therapy to do .
for what ?
the more we talk , the worse i get .
look at me .
i' m a fucking wreck .
i had that dream again .
the one where you' re mussolini ?
no , the other one .
you know , i' m 16 , you' re freud .
and then i' m scared out of my mind ... ... and these giants are coming at me with guns .
and i' m fighting them off .
too bad .
the limp sword dream ?
yeah .
i probably shouldn' t be listening to this .
well , then don' t .
paul ?
sorry .
let' s talk about it .
and you don' t think this dream is sexual ?
you' re thinking the sword is my cock , i can' t get it up .
that ain' t it .
because i was with sheila last night , i had a hard on you could swing from .
i don' t need to know that .
you could hang wet towels on this one .
congratulations .
it' s a nice thing to have .
he' s built like a racehorse in that area .
thank you .
i get it .
i' ve seen it .
hey , wait in the car , you .
so , what does it mean ?
sex can mean a lot of things .
i think , in this case , it' s about performance anxiety .
you' re under a lot of pressure .
you' re changing your life , you' re trying to find a job that fits you .
doc , nothing is gonna fit though .
this 9 to 5 bullshit ?
forget about it .
i' il fucking kill myself .
you know they take taxes out of your paycheck ?
what the fuck is that ?
like , i' m doomed .
i' il wind up selling hot dogs on the street .
take a deep breath , paul .
i mean , my heart' s beating like a rabbit !
just relax .
you' re hyperventilating .
that' s all it is .
here , breathe into this bag .
and breathe in and then breathe out .
in , out .
this is your fault .
excuse me ?
this is all your fault .
my fault ?
you tell me to get a job like i' m a fucking nobody .
it' s humiliating .
really ?
is it ?
you know what , i' m doing the best that i can .
all right ?
if it' s not appreciated , or if my best isn' t good enough for you ... ... then find somebody else to talk to , you selfish son of a bitch !
because i didn' t ask to be born !
what the hell is that about ?
i' m sorry .
i' m grieving .
it' s a process .
all right , i' m the patient .
that' s enough .
now what are you taking ?
echinacea , goldenseal .
immune system .
there' s a lot of plants and ticks .
okay .
do you know the television show little caesar ?
yeah , i know it .
the producer of the show is a man named raoul berman .
a mutual friend told him i know you , so mr. berman called me this morning ... ... and said that he would like to meet you .
for what ?
i don' t know .
why don' t you meet him and find out ?
we just got him out of our house .
now we' re having dinner with him ?
that' s not very professional , is it ?
it' s social .
he' s meeting a television producer who could give him a job .
he' s very nervous about it , and he asked me to buffer .
i' m here to buffer .
he' s a grown man .
why does he need a chaperone ?
he doesn' t .
he needs a buffer .
that' s me .
i' m here in a buffering capacity .
if you say " buffer " one more time ...
331 , they' re all inside .
we' re gonna go eat something .
we' il be back before they finish dinner .
didn' t you just take two of those ?
did i ?
no , that was the other ...
the chinese herb enzyme thing .
this is different .
just don' t drink anything .
drink ?
honey , i' m a doctor , i know what i' m doing .
i adore this place .
it is the best sushi in town .
yeah , it smells good .
did you try the yellowtail , paul ?
they got any real food around here ?
i mean , this is like eating fucking bait .
raoul , what' s very interesting about paul is that he was born without a filter .
he has no filter .
he says whatever comes through his mind .
he never edits himself .
what' s with you ?
what do you mean ?
you sound like a fucking retard .
i took a pill .
i took an ibuprofen pill .
i probably shouldn' t have had the mai tai or the sake .
it interacted , and it' s giving me a little problem with my upper lip .
that' s all .
it will be gone in about an hour .
will you shut the fuck up ?
see that ?
he just told me to shut the fuck up !
i love it !
i absolutely love it .
in two seconds , i' m gonna stick this fork in your fucking eye .
he will stick a fucking fork in my eye !
what did i tell you ?
unfiltered .
could i get another one of these , please ?
me too .
i' d like a cosmopolitan .
no .
no .
no .
why not ?
the buffer has had too much .
okay .
mr. berman , i love your show .
thank you .
and anthony bella , the guy that plays nicky caesar ?
he grew up in bensonhurst , right next door to my cousin' s friend' s husband .
i hate to bust your bubble , but there' s no way he' s from bensonhurst .
he' s , like , a professional italian from connecticut or someplace .
listen , paul , i have to ask , would you be interested in working on little caesar ... ... as a consultant and technical advisor , you know , coaching the actors ?
making sure the dialogue rings true .
yeah , whatever .
oh , my god !
this is so exciting !
fantastic !
how about a toast ?
a toast to paul and little caesar .
down !
that restaurant was really good .
i liked it up until the attempted whacking .
now , is that the right terminology , mafia shrink ?
sorry .
do you know that you were muttering and drooling like one of your relatives tonight ?
what are those pills ?
what are you taking ?
you know , at this point , anything i can get my hands on .
okay ?
because i am staring into a big hole that i can' t fill up .
you don' t need this .
you don' t need this paul vitti thing in your life right now .
especially not right now .
i think you need to be grieving for your father .
you know , it' s just , i' m finding the whole thing just a little confusing .
you know , i became a therapist ... ... because he was a therapist .
i mean , it was that easy .
because his approval was so important to me .
i mean , it was everything .
and i never really got it .
so now i' m thinking , is this ... ?
is this the reason i did it ?
and now that he' s gone , do i still wanna do this ?
because i don' t know .
come here , baby .
i just want you to be happy .
hey , pal .
i' il ask you once .
who are you working for ?
i' m working for your mother .
fuck you .
fuck me ?
yeah .
no , no , no , wait , wait !
stop !
wait !
wait !
stop !
who are you working for ?
get me up !
stop !
get me up !
drop him .
i' m working for lou the wrench .
rigazzi .
the wrench ?
yeah , the wrench .
how do you spell his name ?
i don' t know how to spell it .
r i z a z z ...
can' t even spell his fucking name right , you fucking moron .
pull him up .
what' s the matter with you ?
you said drop him .
i said pull him back up .
that ain' t what i heard .
then you heard what you wanted to hear .
i guess you got me there .
what the hell happened to you ?
vitti threw me off a roof .
vitti ?
you talked to vitti ?
yeah , i talked to vitti .
what did you say to him ?
nothing .
you sure you didn' t tell him anything ?
i didn' t say anything , mr. rigazzi .
can i go now ?
i think my leg' s broken .
that must hurt , huh ?
wait a minute .
i have something for that .
i hate to see people in pain .
get him out of here .
what about vitti ?
he' s a hard man to kill .
but he' s not immortal .
our time will come .
okay , roll film .
background .
hey , i like my sausage burnt .
i don' t know how you like your sausage ?
i been doing this 20 fucking years .
you got the money ?
i almost got it .
i' m still light 15 large .
but don' t worry about it , i got it covered .
all i gotta ...
all i gotta ...
cut !
cut !
can you do something about the goddamn smoke ?
cut !
can you do something about the damn smoke ?
this is the trouble with shooting on location ... ... although it' s worth it for the authenticity .
well , it looks authentic .
hey , tony !
tony .
anthony bella , nicky caesar .
this is paul vitti .
you don' t have to tell me who he is .
it' s a pleasure to meet you , mate .
hey , mate .
i don' t believe this .
an english guy .
you ain' t even italian .
australian italian .
there' s a lot of paisans down under .
down under what ?
you like to laugh , don' t you ?
it' s a nervous defense mechanism .
i don' t have to do it if it bothers you .
so i' il just ...
so , paul , are you gonna join us ?
i' m thinking i might .
i like the whole setup here .
sensational , mate .
i can' t wait to work with you .
i got a lot of questions for you .

yes , yes .
paul , thank you .
and welcome .
welcome aboard .

i don' t know who makes these decisions ... ... but there are things that i see that don' t look right .
yes , i sensed this myself .
which elements strike you as wrong ?
well , the people , mainly .
i mean , you got a boss who speaks australian .
what the fuck is that about ?
not my first choice .
and your background is what ?
theater , mostly .
that figures .
i got some people i could bring around ... ... that will add a certain authenticity to the whole thing .
i would be eternally grateful to you if you could .
is there anything else that you would need ?
i' d like one of those trailers like the stars got .

done !
i am gonna go put that in the works right now .

you do not want him to change .
that' s mrs. lopresti .
patti .
patti , i' m ben sobel .

it' s an open race .

i came to tell you that you had a meeting with your parole officer , and who do i see ?
patti lopresti !
patti who ?
stop lying to me .
your whole gang is here .
who says i' m lying ?
i finally get a straight job , i start getting my life together ... ... and you start accusing me ?
that' s how much you trust me ?
paul , it' s not that i don' t trust you .
it' s just that i don' t trust you .
this is what' s so hard about being an ex con .
you make one mistake and nobody lets you forget it .
so now you' re the victim ?
paul , i want the truth .
wait a second .
say that again .
say what ?
what you just said .
i want the truth .
i want the truth .
no , strong , like before .
paul , i want the truth !
that' s it .
that' s good .
what ?
i' m serious , that had power .
i believed you .
you could be an actor .
paul , i am not an actor .
you' re better than the bums here .
there' s this part you could do .
i can' t .
we have this meeting .
we' re shooting now .
there' s this part , you could do it .
i' m telling you , it' s you .
i did do music man in high school .
people thought i was quite good .
jelly , what are you ... ?
help !
help !
hey , help me !
i don' t wanna do this !
does that screaming sound real to you ?
yeah , that sounds pretty real to me .
that was not funny at all .
there was no harness .
they could' ve dropped me .
if you didn' t wanna do it , you should' ve said .
you said a scene on the roof .
i didn' t know they would throw me off .
they didn' t throw you off .
they hung you over the side .
that' s it .
i know what you' re doing .
you' re upset that i have custody of you ... ... so you passive aggressively make me look like a fool .
come on .
you were great .
you were great .
second take , i thought , was better than the first .
jelly wasn' t giving me much , honestly .
so i ...
screw you , paul .
oh , boy .
oh , boy .
that' s it .
okay .
what are you doing , self medicating again ?
no .
don' t give me that decongestant , multivitamin shit .
come on , what are you doing ?
ginkgo biloba .
helps my memory ... ... and i forget what else .
but don' t worry about me .
worry about what you' re gonna say to this parole officer .
i mean , what are you gonna tell him ?
that you left my house ?
that you got your gang back together ?
and for what ?
a high school dropout reunion ?
you recognize that car ?
which car ?
the one that' s been following us for the last few miles .
that ?
oh , yeah .
i know that car .
that' s a mercedes s500 .
that is one sweet machine .
it' s an eight bore .
it comes in a 12 , which is a beast .
lose them .
what ?
lose them .
what ?
lose them !
lose that car ?
you can' t ...
i' m gonna stop , paul .
this could be the fbl .
the fbi is two cars back .
you gotta be more observant .
left .
i' m pulling over .
they won' t shoot us .
it' s daylight .
broad daylight is the best time .
they can see better .
right !
we gotta stop .
this is a lease .
hey , it' s a goddamn lease !
move over .
i' il drive .
move over where ?
get in the back seat .
back seat !
damn seat belt .
get over !
buckle up , doc .
it' s gonna get worse ?
it ain' t gonna get better .
stop it !
oh , my god .
you think they' il get out ?
yeah , that' s james bond and that sea hunt guy , so they got a good shot .
i feel bad .
where are you going ?
i gotta take care of this .
paul , your parole officer ...
send him my regards .
paul , i' m warning you .
if you leave now ...
so long , doc .
that' s it .
you' re on your own now , pal .
that' s it .
i' m done .
i' m ... ... screwed .
so where is he , doctor ?
i wish i knew .
considering i released him into your custody , that' s not quite the answer i was looking for .
he' s got something in the works .
care to tell me what you know ?
i don' t know anything .
i really feel he' s making an effort to go straight .
oh , yeah ?
yes .
that' s why we got two corpses in the bottom of the river ?
here .
vitti with sal masiello .
vitti with patti lopresti .
vitti with eddie devol .
let me know .
i can order you some wallet size .
i am giving you 24 hours to find him and deliver him to me .
otherwise , you' re looking at obstruction of justice and accessory to manslaughter .
can i go ?
sure , but you can' t take your car .
we' re impounding it as evidence .
can i get a ride ?
have a nice day .
i don' t got a lot of time .
they' re probably gonna come looking for me , so we' il go over everything at the club .
paul , not that i' m questioning or anything , but what do we need with this eddie devol ?
the guy is like a petty larceny scumbag .
hey , i ain' t happy about it either .
but if he keeps patti off my back , so be it .
yeah ?
mr. vitti ?
mr. bella asked to meet you in makeup .
can' t .
gotta go .
it' s important .
i' il talk to him tomorrow .
here , here .
tell him you never saw me , okay ?
paul , excellent , mate .
come here , please .
i can' t talk right now , mate .
i' ve gotta ask you a question .
two seconds ?
come on .
i gotta ...
come on .
can we do it later ?
please .
it' s important .
paul , i' m looking for something to do when my character finds out he' s being indicted .
and i was thinking of punching the wall .
but i did that when they killed uncle lenny , and i punched a car ... ... actually , it was a van , when peezee screwed up the big drug deal .
so i' m looking for something different this time .
something that doesn' t involve , you know , punching anything .
kick something .
let me know how it works out .
i gotta go .
paul , wait .
that' s really interesting .
kick what ?
i don' t know .
like , kick a guy in the face .
who ?
anybody , just some guy .
knock him down , give him a couple shots in the head and walk away .
why ?
why not ?
you' re pissed , he' s there .
i got friends waiting for me .
my character wouldn' t do that .
what else you got ?
i don' t know .
you could yell real loud .
yell real loud ?
that' s really original .
shut your fucking mouth .
i don' t care what you do .
i gotta go .
shut your fucking mouth .
i don' t care what you do .
i gotta go .
what' d you say ?
what' d you say ?
wait .
what are you doing ?
wait .
what are you doing ?
