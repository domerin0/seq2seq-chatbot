if you stand aimlessly at a phone booth on a rainy day and meet a man whose face is covered by a violet umbrella ,

this morning around 7 : 30 the top 50m of the sungsoo bridge in seoul suddenly collapsed in the middle ...
i wrote down all the people whom i fought with , bothered , and hurt
this was both my prison journal and autobiography of my evil deeds
i thought i had lived an average life but i' ve sinned too much
all i thought about at that moment was that the guy next door probably ate with one chopstick
but ...
but
who would' ve imprisoned me ?
was it yoo heung sam ?
lee so young or kang changsuk ?
whoever it was , just wait
wait a bit more

oplegnathus fasciatus

that fever remedy really works

the bathroom door is broken and doesn' t lock

or else i' il slice you like sushi

suppositories
how else could i feed you medicine if you fainted ?

it can' t
that was very bad of me

well , if you prefer he doesn' t we can mix drugs into his drink
ristedal solution
it' s a well trusted drug used to treat schizophrenia
well , the duration is important so how long will he ... 15 years

joo hwan
oh daesu , you see talks too much
have you heard this voice before ?
is there anyone who hates me this much ?
i don' t know all the 260 names of your women' s husbands
who' s mido ?
this girl who cries over nothing
joo hwan
did i really talk too much ?
my friend ,
i' d like for you to find that criminal among people you' re close to
congratulations
your case was automatically dismissed yesterday
but remember this by all means
open quote
like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter ...
like a bird from the snare of the fowler ...
free yourself
close quote who are you ?
what about you you rotten bastard ?
i made up my mind when i was imprisoned
that i won' t trust anyone if i get out
if there' s anyone who i find suspicious then i' il create a secret that person and i will only know
that id , monster , is a trap that i made to catch you
you lead a stranger to your place who the hell are you ?
who' s evergreen ?
i tracked down that evergreen id and found the owner' s name
ready to jot it down ?
it' s su daeoh , that' s a strange rare surname
address ?
in eungam
saewoon apartments building 7 , room 407
i' m not doing fine within life in a bigger prison ...
evergreen
who are you ?
you meant to ask this , right ?
you must find out on your own come on , it' s a game
first , who ?
then , why ?
if you figure it out come see me anytime
i' il raise your score you have until july 5th
oh no , only five days left
too short ?
hang in there if you succeed i' il kill myself and not mido
that' s right , mido
i' m going to kill every woman you love until you die
well , you' re notorious for not protecting your women
wow , you' re strong mr. monster
yes , you are the very monster i created
but you won' t find out the " why ? " if you do this 15 years of being curious would go to waste so is that okay with you ?
sit down there
oh , the famous teeth torture
you won' t have enough time to torture me
since i have a weak heart i have a pacemaker in my chest
when it was put in know what i asked the doctor ?
doctor hopkins give me a remote control to turn that motor off
pardon ?
why ?
so that i can kill myself easily at anytime
i' il give you $100, 000 more
oh , what will you do ?
you want to kill me right away but you won' t know why you were imprisoned
you want to torture me but i say i' il kill myself first
do you seek revenge or do you find the truth ?
oh , you' re in a tough spot
i' ve been watching over you for 15 years
i faired well thanks to you
i wasn' t bored or lonely
seeking revenge is the best cure for someone who got hurt
try it
the loss of 15 years the pain of losing your wife and child you can forget all this
once again revenge is good for your health
but ...
what happens after you' ve revenged yourself ?
i bet that hidden pain will probably come back again
are you there , daesu ?
daesu ,
long time no see
hasn' t she been tied up for too long ?
i think you also left the door open
please save me
but i could die first rudolph the red nosed reindeer had a very shiny nose
this dentist is really good
don' t move
don' t move
what' s with you ?
now ...
here we go
you see they say that people shrivel up because they have an imagination
so do not imagine
you' il become brave as hell
now , here comes the real thing
yes ?
you know i' m glad you told me about this place but i haven' t even started
what ?
let' s go
let' s really go
let' s fight
let' s fight
what a roughneck your hand
i' m going to chop off your hand
you touched mido' s breasts
then what about my tongue ?
you still don' t trust me you rotten bastard ?
it looks hard to accomplish
i looked into it , and the reason why the bank refused to pay $270 m ; il ; on isn' t because our building has any irregularities ,
they have an internal problem at their bank
so i think there won' t be any problems
although chairman choi' s equity share is at 25 percent ...
daesu
yeah
did he really say that he' il kill me ?
yeah
because you love me ?
daesu
what ?
i wonder where my love is
the night is getting lonelier
the words we spoke through our eyes can be felt through the hands
so many nights have passed
yet my feelings are constant towards you
tears flood out from my eyes
but there is a face that i miss
they packed their stuff and left in a rental car
mido called the restaurant and quit
let' s go after this is done
you should get some rest today
i can' t even sleep
since i am forlorn
mr. han
do you really think
mido has fallen in love with daesu ?
already ?
daesu , it really hurts
but i' m enduring it
you must know this
how' d you hold out ?
for 15 years ?
there' s always a way
do you like it ?
you really like it , right ?
i want to be good to you
do not worry about future
don' t imagine anything
i feel like thanking all those years in that prison
if i wasn' t in there , could mido have liked me still ?
he could only know that i wanted to chop off mr. park' s hand by putting a bug on us and he knew our whereabouts by tailing us
i' ve been bugged please find it
you know maybe he freed you because he has fun watching you run wild seeking revenge
and never tell you why so he can toy with you forever
you think that' s why ?

but it' s time to close up
can' t i look at the records of class ' 79 ?
it' s dark so turn on the lights
take your time
joo hwan ?
let me ask you something
do you know lee woojin of class ' 79 ?
i think he went to america to study
lee woojin ?
don' t know him so is that the bastard' s name ?
how' d you find out ?
i looked through all the school' s albums and found his face
i don' t know who someone is just with a name
got anything else ?
why don' t you look for the school records or something ?
do you know lee soo ah ?
she was in the same grade
lee soo ah ?
she died what class was she in ?
homeroom two of our senior year she was in my room
next to yours so what about her ?
why is there no photo ?
ah , she died so that' s why
how did soo ah die ?
that' s right , you wouldn' t know
she died after you transferred
she went alone to the habchun and fell into the river
she croaked like a dead fish
a week later they found her bloated body in the water
what was she like ?
her ?
she was a total slut
on the outside she acted like a prude but she was a filthy whore on the inside
rumors had it that that slut fucked everyone at school
i should' ve gotten in there
i also heard that her family was really rich
her grades were good , too
but the bad thing was that she was a slut
man
wow , this is such an old story
daesu !
daesu , i don' t remember since it was so long ago but that soo ah , you see ...
wait , daesu , you also ...
hey what' s going on ?
hey !
joo hwan !
joo hwan , what' s with you ?
joo hwan !
joo hwan !
daesu
daesu ?
my sister wasn' t a slut
you must accept this
since you got rid of your bug
i had to come all the way here
to eavesdrop
so that' s why joo hwan died because of you
okay ?
i' m going to kill you !
you son of a bitch !
i am going to rip you into little pieces
you motherfucking cocksucker !
we' re not open yet please come back in an hour
someone who got six gold teeth recommended this place
mr. park ?
i had to move because of you
as a commemoration
i installed a new tv do you like it ?
there are so many channels great , huh ?
there are even some who prefer to stay here
you lived in a place like this for 15 years ?
it felt like home after 11 years though
come on i don' t need money
an enemy' s enemy is a friend
we threw away the hand ' cause it rotted
damn sons of bitches i' il kick their asses
so why' d you bring me here ?
huh ?
let me go !
if i don' t return after july 5th then let her go
while i was locked up here
i remember someone visiting me
what did that person do ?
was it three times ?
i put a hypnosis inducing drug in your water
sodium barbiturate ?
tv man knows it all
hey mr. !
that' s nonsense
even though it was a catholic school she wouldn' t die because of rumors that she was a slut
there' s probably another reason
could she have been pregnant ?
yeah , i really don' t think soo ah was like that
she was such a pure girl
i know she didn' t put out for anyone
but she did go out with someone back then
so who was that guy ?
i have no idea
choon shim you knew lee soo ah , right ?
who was her boyfriend ?
don' t know ?
shut the hell up
what would you know about friendship ?
shut your crap then who' d know ?
who ?
joo hwan ?
what ?
yeah , i know him
but how' d he know ?
yeah ?
really ?
okay , hang up i' il call you in a bit
choon shim said she heard it from joo hwan
and that you' d know the best
ring , ring , move aside
you' il get hurt if you hesitate
oh daesu
look at you
put it out !
i' m transferring today
to seoul
so butt out , miss kim
you good for nothing !
you' re oh daesu , right ?
and you' re miss ... among the girls
you know how rumors are
i heard you' re really funny say something
me being so popular is such a big hassle
there' s this father and son they went to the public bath , and ...
see you later
see you later !
third grade , third class pals
come on wait
come here i won' t
hurry and come here okay , okay
satisfied ?
raise this up come on
raise it i won' t
what ?
it tickles
give it here
what are you doing ?
let me see
what are you doing ?
let me see stop
go away
was it really soo ah ?
are you sure ?
i don' t know her name
all i know is that she' s in your room , and she rides a red bike
have a good trip see you in seoul if i go
where are you going ?
going on a date with choon shim
i' il kill you if you shoot your mouth
no way
you get locked up for 15 years just for saying that ?
was that such a big crime ?
be it a grain of sand or rock in water they sink as the same
that' s what lee woojin believes
then what does july 5th stand for ?
that' s the day
lee soo ah died
now it' s over
instead of seeking revenge you wanted to find out why you were imprisoned , right ?
now we' il run away where he can never find us , right ?
i can' t end it like this
seeking revenge has become a part of me
but you don' t even know where he lives
like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter ...
like a bird from the snare of the fowler ...
free yourself
it' s a phrase from " jamon " 6 , verse 4
jamon in english means maxim
and evergreen said he lives in a high tower
so six and four must just be floors
fourth floor
sixth floor
or the sixty forth floor ?
p ?
penthouse !
please insert the code
what would you like me to pray ?
wrong entry please insert again
wrong entry please insert again
dear lord please let me meet a younger man next time
please let woojin bow next to daesu and make him beg for forgiveness
you slept with your sister
let' s go up and talk
sic him !
don' t be so violent
feels great
you slept with your sister i feel so refreshing
and i started the rumors
that' s why your sister died
looking through the mirror reminds me of that day
doesn' t it ?
erasing my memory and telling me to find the truth was unfair
i won , so die like you promised
you think you forgot that day because you were hypnotized ?
are you sure ?
do you know the real reason why you can' t remember ?
let me tell you
you just , forgot
is that bland ?
but it' s true that you just forgot
why ?
since it' s not your business
your rumor grew so out of proportion that soo ah being pregnant became a rumor
my sister got sucked into that rumor and began believing it
so her period stopped and her belly began to swell
funny , isn' t it ?
ever thought how' d a girl feel bearing both her child and nephew ?
understand now ?
your tongue got my sister pregnant
it wasn' t lee woojin' s dick
it was oh daesu' s tongue
is that why you killed your sister ?
what ?
ever thought how' d the boy feel impregnating a child and nephew ?
you were probably afraid
afraid that everyone will know once the baby' s born
when you realized that she imagined it after you killed her you hating me is understandable
they said soo ah died alone at the dam but who took this photo ?
and what about the date july 5th ?
this is no fun
i' il just finish what i was saying listen carefully my story is really fun
ever heard of posthypnotic suggestion ?
you suggest something during hypnosis and then it' s acted out in your wakened state
still haven' t figured it out ?
you lead a stranger to your place who the hell are you ?
what about you you rotten bastard ?
we hypnotized both of you
one very fortunate thing was that both of you were highly receptive to hypnosis compared to others
isn' t this fun ?
one word gets you pregnant one word gets you in love
but no matter how much you two are receptive to hypnosis or no matter how good of a hypnotist mrs. yoo is getting people to fall in love isn' t easy
so do you know how we did it ?
oh that ?
they said the ratings are low your first suggestion was to go to that restaurant after your release
next , to react to the cell phone' s melody
when you heard this you were to say something
who are you ?
do you like your clothes ?
and mido was to react to the man who were to say this when she grabs your hand , your reaction would be ...
of course ...
your gravest mistake wasn' t failing to find the answer
you can' t find the right answer if you ask the wrong questions
it' s not " why did woojin imprison me ?
it' s " why did he release me ?
once again why did woojin release daesu after ... 15 years ?
laugh , and the world laughs with you weep , and you will weep alone
mr. han
mister han !
mido ...
mido doesn' t know right ?
why' d you hide her there ?
you thought he' d hate me because i cut off his hand , right ?
couldn' t you figure it out that it was a trap ?
how can you protect your woman with that brain of yours ?
i' ve been secretly raising mido since she was three
what' s wrong with you ?
and mr. park' s hand ?
you moron
know that new prison of his ?
he said he had to move so i bought him that building for his hand !
daesu !
a box is here
it' s that same violet box
he' s telling me to open it no !
no , mido , don' t
don' t open it no matter what
if you open it something terrible will happen
what' s in it ?
you know , don' t you ?

can' t you come right now ?
i' m scared
my sweet pea you can wait for me , right ?

good girl i' il call you very soon , okay ?
i beg you
please don' t tell mido
what has she done wrong ?
you know it was all my fault
i have ...
i have committed a terrible sin to your sister
and i was very wrong to you
i' m really sorry
so what i' m saying is ...
so please leave mido alone , okay ?
if
mido finds out the truth , you asshole ,
i' il rip your whole body apart , and no one will be able to find your body anywhere
why ?
because i' m going to chew it all down
woojin !
woojin , i made a mistake
please forget what i said
sir !
boss !
woojin !
we' re evergreen old boys remember ?
with the energy from a green pine tree the great sangnok high ...
i' il do whatever you want
i' il do anything i beg you
woojin , if you want me to be a dog , i will !
i' m woojin' s dog from now on !
i' m your puppy !
woof woof woof wooof
look , i' m wagging my tail
i' m a dog i' il guard the house i' il be your slave dog
the box ...
just leave it closed
now , what joy will i live for ?
daesu
it really hurts
but i' m enduring it
you must know this
how' d you hold out ?
for 15 years ?
my sister and i loved each other even though we knew everything
could it be the same with you two ?
do you like it ?
you really like it , right ?
i want to be good to you
soo ah
woojin
i know you' ve been scared
so let go of me , okay ?
alright ?
remember me , okay ?
i have no regrets what about you ?
this is the whole adventure i went through until now
thank you for listening to a terrible story till the end
i hope that you understand the reason for sending a letter instead of talking to you in person
the reason for that is that i have no tongue
to be honest i have no reason to help you
but you see ?
i was touched by this last sentence
even though i' m worse than even a beast
don' t i have the right to live ?
the hypnosis could go wrong and distort your memories
will that be okay ?
if you' re ready stare at that tree
the tree is slowly changing into a concrete column
you' re now in woojin' s penthouse
it' s a dreary night
the sound of your footsteps to the window permeates the room
when i ring my bell you' il be split into two persons
the one who doesn' t know the secret is oh daesu
the one who keeps the secret is the monster
when i ring the bell again the monster will turn around and begin walking
with each step you age one year
when the monster reaches seventy he will die
there' s no need to worry
it will be a very peaceful death
now , good luck to you
what' s wrong ?
look at you
were you with somebody ?
i love you
daesu
