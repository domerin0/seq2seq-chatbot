they seem shifty , they seem standoffish .

you don' t understand .
can' t they find me a kitten ?

albanian terrorists have a staging area ... ... for their atomic workshop .

there are unconfirmed reports at this time from a reliable source ... ... that things are in motion .
what i' m hearing and this is a quote ...
the president is looking for a swift ... ... painless , and victorious conclusion to the war .
however , the source will not go on record .
all i can tell you is this comes from the highest level .
new york times , washington post ... ... detroit register , sacramento bee ... ... all in remission .

albanian harvest festival .
there' s gotta be something .
anyway , she gives him the sacred whatever it is ... ... telling him this is a sacred traditional offering ... ... given to the man who ties the first sheaf ... ... the last sheaf , who the fuck knows what sheaf ?
this is good .
is she saying this in albanian ?
she' s speaking in albanian ... ... because this is the only way it can be understood ... ... by her sacred , sainted , and aged mother .
we' re picking them up now .
now the old lady starts to speak .
you have brought peace not only to this
no , no .
the child speaks .
a face of innocence , no cynicism .
the child says ...
are you getting this ?
now , the old broad starts to break down and cry .
big bird shrugs off his secret service , goes over there ... ... covers her with his own coat , end of story .
can you find out if there is any chance we could get some rain at andrews tomorrow ?
thank you .
how is big bird holding up by the way ?

i' m afraid that' s the trouble , miss ames .

what am i gonna do ?
i have a three year old daughter ... ... eventually headed for orthodonture .
oh , god .
now that the cla knows , i' m gonna lose everything ... my career , my reputation .
what am i gonna do ?
brazen it through .

after i' m done with them , what do they want me to do ?
lug them back to the district or dump them in the country ... ... let the fbi trip over them ?
legal department says you pick .
depends on what we want to do with them .
this is a newsbreak special report on the war in albania .
we' ve just received more details ... ... of the young albanian girl seen running for her life .
the young girl was trying to escape after hearing her family was killed .
apparently , there was a family connection in canada .
two things i know to be true ... ... there' s no difference between good flan and bad flan ... ... and there is no war .
guess who i am .
i would like to point out that i am under medical care ... ... and taking medication , side effects of which have a little bit
quite touching .
i also take this opportunity ... ... to suggest that , equally , i admit to nothing ... ... and i would like my lawyer present .
we show , and nsa confirms ... ... there are no nuclear devices on the canadian border .
there are no nuclear devices in albania .
albania has no nuclear capacity .
our spy satellites show no secret terrorist training camps ... ... in the albanian hinterland .
the border patrol , the fbl , the rcmp report ... ... no repeat no untoward activity ... ... along our picturesque canadian border .
the albanian government is screaming its defense .
the world is listening .
there is no war .
of course , there' s a war .
i' m watching it on television .
who might you be ?
what you all said and done ?
my name is conrad brean .
who do you work for ?
nobody whose name you want me to say , mr. young .
i promise you .
so well and good , but when the fit hits the shan ... ... somebody has to stay after school .
who do you suppose that might be ?
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
the spy satellites show it , mr. brean .
they show no war .
then what good are they if they show no war ?
i mean , why we spend a quarter trillion dollars a year on defense department ?
what good are they if they show nothing ?
are they useless or just broken ?
or what ?
i would like to point out further ... ... that these medications taken in conjunction
if there' s no threat , then where are you ?
let me go one more .
if there' s no threat , what good are you ?
mr. brean , you are the threat .
i' m the threat ?
i am the threat ?
what have i been doing the last 30 years ... ... that you haven' t been doing .
you wanna me fool in on that ?
the last 30 years , mr. brean ... ... i have been working to ensure the security of my country .
i' m sure that speaks well of you and your parents ... ... but if forced to choose between the security of your country ... ... and the security of your job , which would you pick ?
while you hesitate , permit me to suggest ... ... that they are one in the same .
your country and your job .
i' m doing my job , mr. brean .
that' s what you see me doing .
i' m doing my job , too .
let me ask you something .
let me ask you a simple question .
why do people go to war ?
why they go to war ?
i' il play your silly game .
ok .
why they go to war ?
to ensure their way of life .
would you fight to do that ?
i have .
if you went to war again , who would it be against ?
your ability to fight a two ocean war against who ?
sweden and togo ?
that time has passed .
it' s over .
the war of the future is nuclear terrorism .
it' il be against a small group of dissidents ... ... who , unbeknownst perhaps to their own governments , have ...
to go to that war , you have to be prepared .
you gotta be alert .
the public has gotta be alert ... ... because that is the war of the future ... ... and if you' re not gearing up to fight that war ... ... then eventually the ax will fall .
you' il be out in the street .
you can call this a drill , call this job security ... ... call it anything you like , but i got one for you .
you go to war to preserve your way of life .
chuck , this is your way of life .
and if your spy satellites don' t see nothing ... ... if there ain' t no war ... ... then you can go home and take up golf my friend ... ... ' cause there ain' t no war but ours .
thank you .
drive carefully .
bye bye .
nice enough people .
they just hadn' t thought it through .
you talked us out of there .
no , no .
we just got delayed .
we' re going to nashville .
what ?
i said you could talk a dog off a meat truck .
thank you .
no , no , no .
we just got stuck .
it' s ok .
all systems five by five .
see you in nashville .
you saved our bacon .
it was just a phenomenal performance .
you turned them around .
you turned them around like a
they just hadn' t thought it through .
he' s moving across the tarmac .
but it appears something has distracted the president ... ... and he has stopped moving toward the waiting motorcade .
i appears there' s a little girl ... ... trying to speak to the president .
it seems she' s speaking in is it albanian ?
can we get someone to translate ?
dan , i think what she is saying ... ... is that this wheat offering is sort of ceremonial ... ... and that it is the first sheaf ... ... the first cut of the harvest .
i' m not proficient in albanian ... ... but the old woman is quite taken ... ... as the president is offering her the coat .
it is quite an emotional moment here .
# there comes a time in the course of human events ... #
# ... when a threat must be answered with courage and strength . #
# our forefathers earned the right to be free . #
# now it' s time to guard their dream . #
# we guard our american borders . #
# we guard the american dream . #
# we guard our right to fight for democracy ... #
# ... and keep our country free . #
# we guard our american spirit . #
# we guard the american dream . #
# our country' s built on the rock of liberty . #
# and we , as people must keep it free . #
# it is for life ... #
# ... liberty ... #
# ... the pursuit of happiness ... #
# ... freedom , ' tis of thee . #
# we guard our american borders . #
# we guard the american dream . #
i loved the fat , wet albanian broad .
thank you .
you know why ?
it was understated .
you got lucky with the rain , too .
we had to divert the plane to boca raton .
you should have come to me .
we have rain machines .
i' m a producer .
i make rain .
next time .
i have just gotten word ... ... that the situation in albania is resolved ... ... that it is resolved .
the cla confirms ... ... that our troops along the canadian border ... ... and overseas are standing down .
i must take this opportunity to call upon our president to say
what does he mean , the situation has been resolved ?
he just ended the war .
he ended the war ?
why did he have to do that ?
i think the cla has just cut a better deal .
he ended the war ?
he can' t end the war .
he' s not producing this .
this is in bad taste .
can we stop this ?
stop .
it' s over .
can we stop this ?
can we stop this ?
stop the choir .
it has been quite a week , richard .
i can' t remember when any president of united states ... ... was hit with the flu , a war ... ... and accused of sexual misconduct by a teenage girl ... ... all in the same seven day period .
this , of course , only days before he runs for reelection .
we' ve just received information from sources at the cla ... ... that confirms the cessation of hostilities ...
the cla .
i thought they let us out too easily .
the war' s over .
it' s over .
i saw it on television .
i have to sell my house .

a brave american serviceman is left behind .
a hero .
oh , my god .
i can' t believe it .
what was i thinking ?
we had a war .

years ago , when i first went out to hollywood ... ... they said to me , " it' s too theatrical .
you know i was from the theater .
so , everything was over their heads .
it' s too theatrical .
not theatrical .
he thinks it' s too corny .

i' m coming up .
my fellow americans , i thank a merciful god ... ... and i am sure each and every one of us ... ... will thank that supreme power ... ... whatever we conceive that power to be ... ... that peace is at hand .
the threat of nuclear terrorism has been quelled .
mr. president , i' m using a little more projection ... ... because i think this speech needs a little bit a " umph " .
bear with me .
thank you so much .
that was so moving .
thank you so much .
thank you .
you konow , connie ?
i felt very much at home in there .
simple quirk of fate .
i could have gone this way .
it' s all a change in wardrobe .
so , what do you think ?
was it too much ?
i' il tell you , stanley .
you did it .
yeah .
you did it .
you jumped in there ... ... and saved the thing when the thing needed saving .
you don' t think it was too much ?
personally ?
maybe it was .
of course the president doesn' t have to say it that way , connie .
it' s like plato once said .
it doesn' t matter how the fuck you get there as long as you get there .
he said that ?
connie , what is it exactly you do for the president ?
my fellow americans , i thank a merciful god ... ... and i' m sure all of us will thank that supreme power ... ... whatever we conceive that power to be ... ... that peace is at hand .
the threat of nuclear terrorism has been quelled .
we are in contact with the albanian premier ... ... who assures me and ... ... this government credits his assurances ... ... that his country does not wish us ill .
know any latin ?
i , claudius .
that' s what i know .
i need a latin motto for the patch .
the 303 patch . ... by a designation number , 303 .
a member of the group was left behind , what were then , enemy lines .
and i can only say to those family members of group 303 ... ... whose members are , i know as i speak ... ... gathering to comfort you .
to the parents of the missing man ... ... i can only say no effort will be spared ... ... to find this brave man and bring him home .
we' ve just received this photograph of schumann in captivity ... ... held by a dissident group of albanian terrorists .
now , i don' t know how many of you are familiar with morse code ... ... but could you bring the camera closer and here , please ?
you' il see his sweater is worn .
it has been unraveled in places .
and those places form dashes and dots ... ... and those dots spell out a message in morse code .
that message is , " courage , mom .
courage , mom .
he got the message through .
courage , mom .
not bad for government work .
having a good time ?
haven' t had this much fun since live tv .
to the men and women of unit 303 ... ... to my fellow citizens , i say , " courage , mom .
i have informed the albanian government that we will not rest ... ... until the safe return of sergeant schumann .
i' m told his unit mates gave him the nickname " old shoe .
wasn' t there a folk song called " old shoe ?
do you remember that ?
something like ...
i don' t know .
i can vaguely remember it .
do you know what i' m talking about ?
old shoe .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
good night and god bless .

yes .
it' s like being a plumber .
do your job right , nobody should notice .
when you fuck up , everything gets full of shit . ... symbol of the military team ... ... sergeant william schumann , the " old shoe .
what do you say , we line up the president for the peace prize ?
our job ends on election day .
yes .
but , come on .
just for the symmetry of the thing ?
that' s right .
if kissinger can win the peace prize ... ... i wouldn' t be surprised to wake up and find out i' d won the preakness .
well , yes , but our guy did bring peace .

that' s what it is .
you know , there' s no academy award for producing .
you' re kidding .

you just got to take the bitter with the better .
job' s almost done .
knock on wood .
we did a good job .
that' s our reward .
you know , you can' t save the world .
all you can do is try .
ain' t that the truth ?
and , as we said , the president ... ... thrust of the albanian episode to put him over the top .
yes .
you could say that , shirley , but it' s just simply just not true .
what would be true , then ?
well , you said it yourself earlier , if i may rephrase ... ... that the success of the president in the polls
as of today , 89 % favorable .
89 % favorable ... ... is based not on the events , which of course we cannot control ... ... but on the spin given to those events .
what' s the lesson here , connie ?
never give up .
never give up .
you' re right .
you' re right .
the show must go on .
proud traditions .
i am prouder of this than anything i ever did in my life .

another great race today , johnny .
who are you going to ride in the stakes ?
eddie , like my daddy always used to say
the message is irrelevant .
the main element here we have to deal with ... ... is the fact that fear is what' s driving a lot of people .
ok ?
yes .
commercials .
