meanwhile the war has come to the kitchen .
housewives are showing the enemy what they' re made of .
who would have guessed that a turnip could go so far .
german pocket battleships , scharnhorst and gneisenau are still dodging the allied bombing raids .
the atlantic won' t be safe until they' re beneath the waves !
as the prime minister boards one of our finest navel destroyers ,
winston churchill thanks the boys who have been keeping our convoys safe .
excuse me .
excuse me .
lord louis mountbatten salutes his heroes home .
following the bravery shown by his ' commandos ' ,
lord louis shakes the hands of the men who have shaken jerry rigid .
their raid on the western lsles of norway has been a triumph of military strategy .
one grenade in the right place and bang goes another jerry hq !
so watch out , adolf !
who knows where our boys will strike next .
by the right , quick march .
left , right , left , right , left , right , left , right ,
ieft , right ...
fighting a war means doing one' s job and in the field of battle , gentlemen , every second counts .
one mistake or miscalculation and the results can be catastrophic .
let me tell you a story .
i was sitting in a shell hole , surrounded by the enemy , with not much left of the chap on my right .
the chap to the left was no better off .
sitting beside me was a young soldier screaming in agony .
never seen anything like it , rocking like a child , clutching his head , calling for his mother .
believe me , gentlemen , toothache in the field is no joke .
know what i did ?
i made a stopper out of some brackish mud , a shell case from my 38 and a clove of garlic .
the chap was back in action in under two minutes and the enemy ran like buggery when they smelt him coming .
what we do here is frontline stuff .
alrcraft englnes

sir ?
your war effort is here , private .
so let' s not waste any time , alright .
an army marches on its stomach , cuthbertson and an army that can' t bite is an army that can' t fight .
what' s an army that can' t bite ?
an army that can' t fight , sir .
well , upward and onward , the use of china clay in the shade matching of dentures .

is it very ... dangerous what you do ?
oh , yes , very .

yeah .
you will be careful , won' t you , leslie ?

i' il be fine .
british commandos have seriously damaged the submarine pens and dry docks .

nothing for the pm' s eyes yet , major merton .
anything good in the ' potty pile ' , daphne ?
eight death threats , three requests to open air raid shelters , seven and six in postal orders and ... a cigar ... probably poisoned .
god bless the lunatics .
do you know that without them , this war could be quite serious .
were you ever married , sergeant ?
what would i do that for ?

i' m only interested .

we' il be a laughing stock .
we can explain , can' t we ?
we' il have to explain alright .
bloody court martial .
i don' t mind dying , cuthbertson ... .. but i won' t be humiliated .

there' s a german !
there' s a german !
there' s a sodding german !
run rabbit run
# run run run
# run rabbit run rabbit run run run
shall we go back and kill him ?
i haven' t come all this way to shoot a kraut who likes cooking !
he' s probably gone by now anyway .
at least we' re here , that' s the main thing .
open wide , adolf ! the dentists are coming !
cuthbertson ! >
sorry , sergeant .
# so run rabbit run run run . #
you don' t have to tell me if you don' t want to .
if you must know ... .. it' s cold , wet with more rats than you can shake a stick at .
blimey .
for 28 days you were bored to tears and then on the 29th boof !
the sky lit up , you got your head down , ran like the clappers and hoped some other poor bastard got it , not you .
now , go to sleep .
didn' t you save the life of a general ?
oh , yes ...
general sir william hyde .
i was his driver .
what happened ?
nothing .
go to sleep .
my dad was in the trenches .
at amiens .
he was one of the lucky ones , he came home in one piece .
what are you doing ?
tapping .
sorry .
it' s a habit when i' m nervous .
well , stop it .
did he ... .. say much , your dad ... about the trenches ?
my dad ?
yeah .
i thought you wanted to go to sleep ?
i do ... .. but i' d rather you talked than tapped .
not much .
he was killed by a tram when i was three so i never really knew him .
he was just a face at my bedroom door .
my mum always showed me pictures and i do think about him .
he tells me off in my head .
not always though .
sometimes i make him laugh .
can i ask you something ?
what now ?
why did you choose me ?
who else would be daft enough to carry the grenades ?
he would like this .
it would make him smile .
can you reach it ?
i would if you stood still .
here .
here .
you do it .
it was your idea .
really ?
thanks .
bloody hell ?
how many of those buns did you eat ?
how many shall i cut ?
cut them all .
keep your voice down .
it' s a lot harder than you think .
did you see that ?
you could have your eye out with one of those .
i' ve got a good idea .
we' il make a list of the things we do and then keep it as proof .
we could tot up the damage .
how much are these lines worth ?
five quid each ?
well , that' s one , two , three ... .. that' s 25 quid the lot . < depends what' s on the other end .
that' s a point .
so , supposing these go to like , the hospital or the resistance even ?
just suppose you get on with it .
still , 25 quid is 25 quid , isn' t it ?
well , it' s not actually , it' s only 20 .
what do you mean ?
i left one .
what for ?
in case of emergencies .
how much does cement cost ?
what ?
if we were blowing up a gun emplacement ...
i was trying to work out how much it' s worth .
what for ?
well ...
we put the damages on the left and what it' s worth on the right .
are you a bloody accountant now ?
no , listen .
i had a mate who bought a riley roadster before the war .
he polished it every sunday , but the birds kept crapping on the bonnet .
so , what he did was , he bought a garage .
the only problem is he reckons the garage cost more than the car .
has this got a point , private ?
yeah , yeah , the point is ,
i reckon that two garages costs the same as one gun emplacement .
sergeant ?
to put it another way , one gun emplacement costs the same as three riley roadsters .
you' ve got a head like a toy box , cuthbertson .
when are we going to eat ?
hello ?
hello ?
hang on , sir .
africa , that' s where we stand or fall .
he' s on the line now .
about time .
put him through .
i want answers yesterday , merton .
lose africa and we lose the med .
hello ?
no one here , faith .
one moment , prime minister . < he' s on line three , prime minister .
hello , monty .
how are you , old cocker ?
jolly good .
now tell me something , general ... .. what do your knees look like in shorts ?
' sleep during the day , travel by night ' , you said . >
that' s alright .
so far , it hasn' t been necessary .
' crawling with men and machinery ' .
thanks , private .
all we need do is find a road or a signpost .
to where ?
there' s nothing to do .
it' s not a problem .
there will be plenty to do when we get there . < get where ?
there' s no one around , the whole place is shut .
hello ?
anyone ?
we' re here !
we' ve invaded !
shut up !
i' m starving .
i' m sergeant king , how do you do ?
well , maybe we could get something to eat or something .
maybe we could steal a car .
oh , yes .
good idea
which one of the many fine vehicles would you care to requisition ?
first rule of survival behind enemy lines : live off the land .
oh , i' m sorry .

can we eat the pie now ?
don' t you get lippy with me , son !
i' il knock the living daylights out of you .

you' ve jeopardised this operation .
you' ve been like a kid on a school outing , buying buns , waving stockings about , cosying up to your little cornish pasty .

you canoodling up to some french tart , practically slipping her one .

don' t tell me to piss off .
no !
everything you' ve asked , i' ve done .
every order you' ve given , i' ve followed .
where has it got us ?
nowhere .
now , i' m a deserter .
i' ve nearly been drowned .
i' m tired and i' m hungry .
whether you like it or not , i' m going to eat this pie .
i can' t believe you' ve done that .
no , i take that back .
i can believe it .
look at you .
you know why you' re called the kaiser ?
you' re a jumped up , washed up , over the hill has been .
finished ?
no !
you know what ?
back home , you command about as much respect as a fly on dog shit !
smart arsed little turd !
i gave you a chance .
nobody else would be stupid enough to give you a gun , but i did .
i thought you had guts , but the only thing you' re good at is whingeing .
it' s a good thing your dad died when he did , so he never saw the whining tosspot that his son had become .
can you see anything ?
nothing .
a sign or something ?
no .
we' ve got to find out where we are .
i' il see what i can find .
i didn' t mean ... .. what i said about your dad .
i' il stand guard then .

# if that siegfried line' s still there . #
let' s find out where we are .
you' ve got the matches .
is that cheese off ?
nah , it' s french .
do you want some ?
no , i want you to strike a match so i can see what i' m doing .
closer .
that' s better .
now then , there' s the railway line so we' re ...
lancasters .
lucky buggers .
hold it still .
sitting down to bacon and eggs in half an hour .
you and your belly .
slren blares
oh , you' re still here ?
so are you .
we' re all still here .
faith , you look terrible .
is he still here ?
no .
he' s meeting with the joint chiefs .
a chance to make a break for it .
oh , good luck .
thanks .
more light reading for you .
sorry about the cigar ash .
he was on one of his nocturnals again .
this belongs up here , i think .
how are we supposed to run a war when the prime minister keeps interfering .
nobody listens ! >
why won' t the buggers listen ?
faith .
oh , bad luck , faith .
10 feet short of the wire .
they look like teacups .
bloody big teacups .
what do you think ?
nah .
too risky .
what' s that fly swat thing ?
fly swat ?
looks like an aerial .
some sort of listening device .
that must be worth a fortune .
come on .
we wouldn' t make it to the fence .
move .
well , it' s just over there .
come on , it' s crawling with bleedin ' germans .
of course it' s crawling with germans , that' s why we came .
i don' t believe this .
you were going to blow up the scharnhorst with one grenade .
destroy st nazaire single handed .
we find one piddly observation post and you say it' s too risky .
keep your voice down !
one hand grenade , you said .
we' ve got a bag of the bastards .
well , if you won' t , i will .
you wouldn' t last five minutes .
i' il be out in four then .
once it' s dark and i' m inside ... .. i' il attach some grenades to the fly swat , move to the ops room with the remaining grenades , then up it goes .
wait .
where am l ?
you' re that pebble there .
what pebble ?
by the fence , where we cut through .
what am i doing there ?
standing guard .
i don' t want to stand guard !
i didn' t come here to stand guard .
i am giving you an order .
well , i' m disobeying it .
i' m younger and i' m faster and i want to blow up the fly swat .
you can' t !
whoever goes in there is going to die !
then what' s the point in standing guard ?
here .
take the grenades .
blow your arse off .
you and your medal .
it' s not that .
you can' t stop being a hero .
i wasn' t a hero .
don' t give me that tosh . < it' s not tosh .
i changed a tyre , that' s all i did .
what ?
i don' t understand .
the general was in the back seat .
a bombardment went up .
a piece of shrapnel caught the front tyre and we got a puncture .
and ?
general sir william hyde told me to get out and change it .
a shell exploded to the right of us , the jack slipped , the car fell on my foot .
i drove some 10 miles with a smashed heel .
so you were decorated for changing a tyre ?
yes , i know ,
rac patrol men do it every day .
can we get on with the weapons check ?
two revolvers ... .. and twenty rounds .
grenades ?
five in the bag and five in the nylons .
did you see any more action ?
i didn' t .
i was invalidated out and joined the medical corps .
so you haven' t done anything like this before .
well , i hate to say this , sergeant ... .. but i wish you hadn' t told me that .
it' s fine .
it' s not a problem .
four for the fly swat and the rest for the ops room and no one stands guard .
agreed ?
agreed .
hope you' ve got a handbag to go with them stockings ?
alright ?
yeah .
through you go .

it' s not a problem .
we couldn' t have done all that , could we ?
let' s get the hell out of here !
leslie !
sorry to trouble you .
i' m looking for a miss emma fraser .
now , africa is the absolute priority .
what the hell did i do with that thing ?
i want to know everything that is going on out there .
when i say everything , i mean everything .
i don' t want a camel to so much as break wind without it ending up on my desk .
here it is .

what the hell is this ?
not funny .
now , i don' t want another shambles like singapore , gentlemen .

he' s depressed .
he won' t get out of his cot .
have you tried clemmie ?
she' s dining with the archbishop .
he' s an old man , he needs a holiday .
failing that , a victory .
anything .
something to lift his spirits .
good luck .
whose turn is it ?
yours .
i sat with him last night  reading kipling .
why don' t you go home , faith ?
yes , i know ...
i look terrible .
i promised the king victory , merton .
gave my word to the country .
i don' t know if i can do it .
well , would you like a whisky , sir ?
no , merton , i don' t want a whisky .
i want a wander .
i don' t know if this rabbit is going to come out of the hat .
cuthbertson ... .. we' ve got company .
< come on .
it' s bloody following us !

i bet it' s one of ours .
it can' t be one of ours !
that' s not fair .

sergeant king .
7 5 ... 3 6 ... 3 9 4 .
1 0 5 1 1 4 3 6 .
private cuthbertson .
we' re dentists .
have we got the girl ?
she' s on her way .
is there any tea in this pot ?
stewed , i' m afraid .
right .
yes , that' s leslie .
are you sure ?
positive .
where were they ?
reconnaissance spotted them in the channel .
floating on some wood .
that was lucky .
that depends on how you look at it .
we don' t take too kindly to spies .
spies ?
yes .
or deserters .
don' t worry .
we' il find out soon enough .
out !
prisoner escort .
attention !
quick march !
no , he said that he had to do something dangerous .
he couldn' t talk about it as it was secret and i might be a spy .
so i know they' re not spies because they borrowed a boat and said they were going somewhere ... .. which must have been france which is where the war is , so they can' t be deserters either .
sorry , do i sound a bit muddled ?
not at all .
thank you , miss fraser .
you may sit down .
well , gentlemen ...
let me tell you , i' ve presided over many court martials , too many if i' m honest , and i' s not a task i relish .
never before have i been asked to listen to such appalling drivel .
you' re deserters .
you know it , i know it , everyone in this room knows it .
you ran away for a coward' s chance on easy street and when your boat sank on the way to lreland ... .. you invented this fairy tale to save yourselves .
what sticks in my throat above all , is that even after you failed to produce evidence in your defence , you still persist in this ridiculous ' boy' s own ' adventure of some personal invasion of france .
you have brought shame on the uniform worn so bravely by so many .
you , sergeant king , you' re beyond contempt , frankly .
not only have you duped an impressionable ...
begging the court' s pardon , sir .
who is this ?
what does he want ?
i' m so sorry , colonel , but er ... .. if i might crave the court' s indulgence for a few moments ?
who are you ?
i want to interview the prisoners .
what ?
i' m major desmond merton .
chief lntelligence advisor to mr churchill .
now , i have here ... .. a ground plan ... of some buildings .
major , these are official proceedings . >
these buildings that you see here , gentlemen ... .. do you know what they are ?
yes , sir .
it' s a listening post , sir .
a ' cap de la hague ' , sir .
interesting .
how do you know ?
it says so at the top , sir .
does it ?
oh , so it does .
major ...
one moment , please , colonel .
are you familiar with these buildings ?
yes , sir .
i think so .
what can you tell me about them ?
well , that' s the fly swat thing , sir .
the ... the what ?
the signal receiver thing , sir .
it appeared to the uninitiated eye to be a giant implement for the swatting of flies .
i see .
what about these chaps here ?
they' re the two teacup things , sir .
they had the general appearance of teacups placed on their side , sir .
they were outside the perimeter , so we left them alone .
excellent .
right .
now what was it that you did ?
blew up the ops room , with grenades .
major ...
they are disgraced .
they' re guilty of theft , deceit and desertion .
you' re not suggesting there' s any substance to their story ?
i' m merely trying to ascertain the facts .
this operations room .
did anything strike you as unusual about it ?
no , nothing , sir .
apart from the smell .
the smell .
the smell ?
what smell ?
er , beef and onions , sir .
beef and onions ?
burned beef and onions .
major , i really must insist ...
burned beef and onions !
ah !
thank you , colonel .
i' ve heard all i need to hear .
well , thank god for that .
in your opinion , major , are they telling the truth ?
no , sir .
they are not .
they didn' t destroy the operations room .
they destroyed the cookhouse .
laughter
i' m not putting up with this .
unless you can substantiate that claim , i intend to pass sentence .
i' m sure that i can , colonel .
how ?
you' re not going to tell me you were there ?
not personally , no , sir , but the 2nd parachute regiment were .
the paras where there ?
119 of them to be exact .
there were after those two teacup things , which you were good enough not to blow up .
their task was to bring bits home for our boffins to play about with .
there were reports of an unexpected and very useful diversion ... .. but until now , no one has been able to confirm it .
initially , we put it down to the french , but it just didn' t tally .
anyway , there we are .
well done , gents .
thank you , colonel for allowing me to clear up that little puzzle .
oh , yes , and i nearly forgot .
message from the prime minister .
he thanks you very much for your letter .
it cheered him up no end .
he apologies for the delay in replying , but he has had rather a lot on .
next time you' re in whitehall , he would be delighted to see you for a cup of tea .
that is tea for king and cuthbertson , sir , not ...
well ...
oh , yes ...
here are your pay books back ... .. which he has signed .
he didn' t want you to go short .
as he said to me ...
a few more lunatics like those dentists , merton , and i can win this war by christmas .
cookhouse .
the bloody cookhouse .
well done , lads !
i' il see you in 28 days , sergeant .
i' il be here , private .
