the hovitos are near .
the poison is still fresh ... three days .
they' re following us .
if they knew we were here , they would have killed us already .
this is it .
this is where forrestal cashed in .
a friend of yours ?
a competitor .
he was good .
he was very , very good .
seor , nobody has come out of there alive ...
please .
seor !
stop .
stay out of the light .
forrestal .
let us hurry .
there is nothing to fear here .
that' s what scares me .
stay here .
if you insist seor .
give me the whip .
throw me the idol .
no time to argue .
throw me the idol , i throw you the whip .
give me the whip .
adios seor .
adios stupido .
dr. jones .
again we see there is nothing you can possess which i can not take away .
and you thought i' d given up .
you choose the wrong friends .
this time it will cost you .
too bad the hovitos don' t know you the way i do , belloq .
yes .
too bad .
you could warn them ... if only you spoke hovitos .
jock , start the engine !
get it up !
jock , the engine ! start the engine jock !
there is a big snake in the plane , jock !
oh , that' s just my pet snake reggie .
i hate snakes jock .
i hate them .
come on .
show a little backbone will you .
neo , meaning new and litic ... i .. t .. h .. i .. c , meaning stone .
alright , lets get back to this site , thriton borough near hazleton
contains a central path passage , and three chambers , or cysts .
this site also demonstrates ... one of the great dangers of archaeology not to life and limb although that does sometimes take place .
no , i' m talking about folklore .
in this case , local tradition held that it was a golden coffin buried at the site .
this accounts for the holes dug all over the burrow , and the generally poor condition of the find .
however , chamber three was undisturbed , and the undisturbed chamber in the grave goods that was found in another ... .. in the area ... give us .... ... reason to date this find that we have .
any questions then ?
no ?
that' s it for today then .
don' t forget , michelson chapter four and five for next time .
and i will be in my office at thursday but not wednesday .
i had it marcus , i had it in my hand .
what happened ?
guess .
belloq ?
want to hear about it ?
not at all .
i' m sure everything given to you for the museum conforms to the international treaty for the protection of antiquities .
it' s beautiful marcus .
i can get it .
i got it all figured out .
marrakech .
i need two thousand dollars .
listen to me .
i brought some people to see you .
look .
i got these pieces .
they' re good pieces marcus .
indiana !
yes the museum will buy them as usual , no questions asked yes they are nice .
they are worth at least the price for a ticket to marrakech .
but the people i brought are important they are waiting .
what people ?
the army intelligence .
they knew you were coming before i did .
seem to know everything .
wouldn' t tell me what they want .
what do i want to see them for ?
what am i in trouble ?
yes , dr. jones .
we have heard a great deal about you .
have you ?
professor of archaeology , expert on the occult .
and uh , how does one say it obtainer of rare antiquities .
that' s one way of saying it .
why don' t you sit down ?
you would be more comfortable .
yes , you' re a man of many talents .
and you studied under professor ravenwood , at the university of chicago ?
yes , i did .
you have no idea of his present whereabouts ?
ah , just rumors really .
somewhere in asia i think .
i haven' t really spoken with him for ten years .
we were friends but ... been a bit of a falling out i' m afraid .
dr jones , you must understand that this is all strictly confidential .
i understand .
yesterday afternoon our european section intercepted a german communique that was sent from cairo to berlin .
you see , over the last two years the nazis have had teams of archaeologists running around the world looking for all kinds of religious artifacts .
hitler is a nut on the subject .
he' s crazy .
he' s obsessed with the occult .
and right now apparently there is some kind of german archaeological dig going on in the desert outside of cairo .
we' ve got some information here , but we can' t make anything out of it and maybe you can .
tanis development proceeding .
acquire headpiece " .
staff of ra .
abner ravenwood , u. s.
the nazis have discovered tanis ...
so what does that mean to you ... tanis ?
city of tanis is one of the possible resting places of the lost ark .
the lost ark ?
yeah , the ark of the covenant , the chest the hebrews used to carry around the ten commandments .
what do you mean commandments , are you talking about " the " ten commandments ?
yes , the actual ten commandments . the original stone tablets that moses brought down out of mt .
heron and smashed , if you believe in that sort of thing .
any of you guys ever go to sunday school ?
the hebrews took the broken pieces and put them in the ark ... and when they settled in canaan , they put the ark in a place called the temple of solomon . in jerusalem . where it stayed for many years , until , all of a sudden , whoosh , it' s gone .
where ?
nobody knows where or when .
however , an egyptian pharaoh shishak invaded the city of jerusalem around about 980 bc and he may have taken the ark back to the city of tanis , and hidden it in a secret chamber called the well of souls ...
secret chamber ....
however , about a year after the pharaoh had returned to egypt , the city of tanis was consumed by the desert in a sandstorm which lasted a whole year , wiped clean by the wrath of god .
obviously we' ve come to the right men , you seem to know all about this tanis .
no , no , not really .
ravenwood is the real expert .
abner did the first serious work on tanis , collected some of its relics .
it was his obsession really .
but he never found the city .
frankly , we' re somewhat suspicious of mr. ravenwood .
an american being mentioned so prominently in a secret nazi cable .
oh rubbish !
ravenwood' s no nazi .
what do the nazis want him for then ?
obviously , the nazis are looking for the headpiece to the staff of ra and they think abner' s got it ...
what exactly is a head piece to the staff of ra ?
the staff is just a stick ... about this big .
nobody really knows for sure how high it is ... it' s capped by an elaborate headpiece , in the shape of a sun with a crystal in the center .
and what you did was you take this staff to a special room in tanis , a map room , a miniature of the city all laid out on the floor .
and if you put the staff in a certain place at a certain time of day , the sun shone through here and made a beam that came down on the floor here , and gave you the exact location of the well of the souls .
where the ark of the covenant was kept , right ?
that' s exactly what the nazis are looking for !
what does this ark look like ?
there is a picture of it right here .
that' s it .
good god !
yes , that' s just what the hebrew' s thought .
now what' s that supposed to be coming out of there ?
lightning , fire ...
power of god or something .
i' m beginning to understand hitler' s interest in this .
oh , yes .
the bible speaks of the ark leveling mountains and laying waste entire regions .
an army which carries the ark before it is invincible .
you did it didn' t you ?
they wants you to go for it !
wow , marcus !
they wants you to get a hold of the ark before the nazis do , and they' re prepared to pay handsomely for it .
and the museum ?
the museum gets the ark when we' re finished ?
oh , yes .
the ark of the covenant .
nothing else has come close .
that thing represents everything we got into archaeology for in the first place .
you know , five years ago i would have gone after it myself .
i' m really rather envious .
i' ve got to locate abner .
i think i know where to start .
will she still be with him ?
possibly .
marion is the least of your worries right now , believe me indy .
what do you mean ?
well , i mean , for nearly three thousand years , man has been searching for the lost ark .
that' s not something to be taken lightly .
no one knows its secrets .
it' s like nothing you' ve ever gone after before .
oh , marcus , what are you trying to do , scare me ?
you sound like my mother .
we' ve known each other for a long time
i don' t believe in magic , a lot of superstitious hocus pocus .
i' m going after a find of incredible historical significance .
you' re talking about the boogie man .
besides , you know what a cautious fellow i am .
nice to see you again doctor jones .
thank you .
hello marion .
indiana jones .
always knew someday you' d come walking back through my door .
i never doubted that .
something made it inevitable .
so what are you doing here in nepal ?
i need one of the pieces your father collected .
i learned to hate you in the last ten years .
i never meant to hurt you .
i was a child .
i was in love .
it was wrong and you knew it !
you knew what you were doing .
now i do .
this is my place .
get out !
i did what i did .
you don' t have to be happy about it .
but maybe we can help each other now .
i need one of the pieces your father collected , a round piece about this size , with a hole in off center with a crystal .
you know the one i mean ?
yeah .
i know it .
where is abner ... where is abner ?
abner is dead .
marion i' m sorry .
what you did to me , to my life !
i can only say i' m sorry so many times .
well say it again anyway !
sorry .
yeah , everybody' s sorry .
abner was sorry for dragging me all over this earth looking for his little bits of junk .
i' m sorry to still be stuck in this dive .
everybody' s sorry for something .
it' s a worthless bronze medallion , marion .
are you going to give it to me ?
maybe .
i don' t know where it is .
well maybe , you can find it .
three thousand bucks .
well that would get me back .
but not with style .
i can get you another two when we get to the states .
it' s important marion .
trust me .
you know the piece i mean ?
you know where it is ?
come back tomorrow .
why ?
because i said so , that' s why .
ha !
see you tomorrow indiana jones !
good evening freulein .
the bar is closed .
we ... we are not thirsty .
what do you want ?
the same thing your friend doctor jones wanted .
surely he told you there would be other interested parties ?
must have slipped his mind .
the man is nefarious .
i hope for your sake he has not yet acquired it .
why , are you willing to offer more ?
oh , almost certainly .
do you still have it ?
no .
but i know where it is .
hey !
how about a drink for you and your men ?
your fire is dying here .
why don' t you tell me where the piece is right now ?
listen , " herr mac " .
i don' t know what kind of people you' re used to dealing with , but nobody tells me what to do in my place .
freulein ravenwood .
let me show you what i am used to .
nick !
take your lousy hands off !
wait ..
i .. can be reasonable .
that time is passed .
you don' t need that ... wait ..
i' il tell you everything .
yes .
i know you will .
let here go !
... whiskey ?
shoot them , shoot them both .
my medallion !
well , jones , at least you haven' t forgotten how to show a lady a good time !
boy , you' re something !
yeah ?
i' il tell you what .
until i get back my five thousand dollars , you' re going to get more than you bargained for .
i' m your goddamn partner !
cairo , city of the lilies , a paradise on earth .
silence !
why do you forget yourselves ?
what is this ?
where did this animal come from ?
ah , oh no ...
cute , ha !
what an adorable creature .
then it shall be welcome in our house .
well no , you don' t have to keep it here just because of me !
i knew the germans had hired you sallah .
you' re the best digger in egypt .
my services are entirely inconsequential to them .
they have hired or shanghaied every digger in cairo .
the excavation is enormous !
they hire only strong backs and they pay pennies for them .
it is as if the pharaohs had returned .
when did they find the map room ?
three days ago .
they have not one brain among them .
except one ....
he' s very clever , he' s a french archaeologist .
what' s he' s name ?
they call him " bellosh " .
belloq , belloq !
the germans have a great advantage over us .
they are near to discovering the well of souls .
well , they are not going to find it without this .
who can tell us about these markings ?
perhaps a man i know can help us .
indy ...
there is something that troubles me .
what is it ?
the ark .
if it is there at tanis ...
then it is something men was not meant to disturb .
death has always surrounded it .
it is not of this earth .
do we need the monkey ?
i' m surprised at you jones , talking that way about our baby .
he' s got your looks too .
and your brain ...
i noticed it , she' s a smart little thing , smart !
hey ! where are you going ?
she' il be all right , have a date .
come on , come on ...
marion !
what' s this ?
it' s a date .
you eat ' em .
sieg heil !
ja .
sieg heil .
ist nae .
ja , ja .
how come you haven' t found some nice girl to settle down with , raise eight or nine kids like your friend sallah ?
who says i haven' t ?
ha , ha !
i do .
dad had you figured a long time ago .
he said you were a bum .
oh , he' s being generous .
the most gifted bum he ever trained .
you know he loved you like a son .
took a hell of a lot for you to alienate him .
not much , just you .
marion , get out of here !
duck !
doctor jones .
die herr in the bar mchten mit ihnen sprechen .
kommen sie bitte mit uns .
you' re looking for me ?
ha , ha , ha ..
belloq .
good afternoon , dr. jones .
i ought to kill you right now .
not a very private place for a murder .
well , these arabs don' t care if we kill each other ,
they' re not going to interfere in our business .
it wasn' t i who brought the girl into this business .
please , sit down before you fall down .
we can at least behave like civilized people .
i see your taste in friends remains consistent .
how odd that it should end this way for us , after so many stimulating encounters .
i almost regret it .
where shall i find a new adversary so close to my own level ?
try the local sewer .
you and i are very much alike .
archaeology is our religion .
yet we have both fallen from the pure faith .
our methods have not differed as much as you pretend .
i am a shadowy reflection of you .
it would take only a nudge to make you like me , to push you out of the light .
now you' re getting nasty .
you know it' s true .
how nice .
look at this .
it' s worthless .
ten dollars from a vendor in the street .
but i take it , i burry it in the sand for a thousand years it becomes priceless .
like the ark .
men will kill for it , men like you and me .
what about your boss ?
der fhrer ?
i thought he was waiting to take possession .
all in good time .
when i am finished with it .
jones , do you realize what the ark is ?
it' s a transmitter .
it' s a radio for speaking to god .
and it' s within my reach .
you want to talk to god ?
let' s go see him together .
i' ve got nothing better to do !
doctor indy !
come back home now !
next time , indiana jones , it will take more than children to save you .
i thought i would find you there .
better than the united states marines , eh ?
marion is dead .
yes , i know .
i am sorry .
life goes on , indy .
there is the proof .
i have much to tell you .
first we will take them home , and then i will take you to the old man .
i can' t figure out how belloq did it .
where did he get a copy of the headpiece ?
there are no pictures , no duplicates of it anywhere .
i tell you only what i saw with my own eyes .
a headpiece like that one .
except around the edges which were rougher .
in the center the frenchman had a bit of a crystal ... and ... and surrounding the crystal , on one side , there were raised markings , just like that one .
they' ve made the calculations in the map room ?
this morning .
belloq and the boss german , dietrich .
when they came out of the map room , they gave us a new spot in which to dig .
out away from the camp .
the well of the souls , uh ?
come , come , look !
look here !
sit down , come !
sit down .
what is it ?
this is a warning ... not to disturb the ark of the covenant .
what about the height of the staff ?
did belloq get it off of here ?
yes , it is here ...
this was the old way , this means six kadams high ' about seventy two inches '
wait !
and take back one kadam ... to honor the hebrew god whose ark this is .
you said their headpiece only had markings on one side .
are you absolutely sure ?
belloq' s staff is too long .
they' re digging in the wrong place !
ha , ha , ha !
bad dates .
i told you not to be premature in your communiqu to berlin . archaeology is not an exact science .
does not deal in time schedules .
the fhrer is not a patient man he demands constant reports .
and he expects progress .
you led me to believe
nothing !
i made no promises !
i only said it looked very favorable .
besides , with the information in our possession , my calculations were correct .
boy they' re not kidding are they ?
what time does the sun hit the map room ?
about nine in the morning .
not much time then . where are they digging for the well of the souls ?
on that ridge .
but the map room is over there .
let' s go , come on .
sallah !
sallah !
mehr wasser !
what is the matter ?
i fetch the water , i shall get it for you .
water ?
i will give you water , no problem , no problem .
i thought you were dead .
they must have switched baskets .
are you hurt ?
no .
you have to get me out of here quick !
they' re going to be back at any minute .
quick ! they keep asking about you , what you know .
what' s wrong ?
cut me loose .
i know where the ark is marion .
the ark is here ?
well i' m coming with you jones !
get me out of here , cut me loose !
you can' t leave me here !
if i take you out of here now they will start combing the place for us .
jones you got to get me out of here !
are you crazy ?
you know that i hate to do this .
you just sit still , keep quiet .
this whole thing is going to be shut .
i' il be back to get you .
that' s it .
who knows , perhaps the ark is still waiting in some anti chamber for us to discover .
perhaps it' s some vital bit of evidence which eludes us .
perhaps the girl can help us .
my feeling exactly .
she was in possession of the original piece for years , she may know much if properly motivated .
i tell you the girl knows nothing .
i' m surprised to find you squeamish that is not your reputation .
but it needn' t concern you , i have the perfect man for this kind of work .
heil hitler .
indy !
here !
we hit stone !
clear it off .
come on find the edges .
good , good , good .
you see indy ?
you see ?
okay bring the pry bars in .
push !
get them in there !
get them under .
good , good .
that' s it .
watch your clothes .
carefully , carefully !
weahh !
sorry indy .
indy , why does the floor move ?
give me your torch .
snakes .
why did it have to be snakes ?
asps .
very dangerous .
you go first .
if you' re trying to escape on foot , the desert is three weeks in every direction .
so please eat something .
i must apologize for the treatment of you .
yeah ?
who' s idea was it ?
no food , no water .
what kind of people are these friends of yours ?
this particular time and place and for my work they are necessary evils .
not my friends .
however , with the right connections , even in this part of the world we are not entirely uncivilized .
beautiful .
i would very much like to see you in it .
ha !
i bet you would .
alright .
what do you got to drink around here ?
you don' t have much time .
soon they will come to harm you .
and i will not be able to stop them .
unless you are able to give me something to placate them .
some ... piece of information ...
which i can use to protect you from them .
i already told you everything i know .
i have no loyalty to jones .
he' s brought me nothing but trouble .
marion , you are beautiful .
i don' t think we need a chaperon .
steadily , steadily .
down , down , carefully ...
you' re all right indy ?
gently boys , gently , gently !
i told you it would be all right !
sallah , get down here !
you pour .
oups !
what is this stuff ren ?
i grew up with this .
it' s my family label .
well , i have to be going now ren .
i like you ren .
very much .
perhaps we meet someday under better circumstances .
we meet again freulin .
you americans , you' re all the same .
always overdressing for the wrong occasions .
now ...
what shall we talk about ?
alright .
take it up .
easy !
you' re a stubbornness that girl .
you like her too much i think .
your methods of archeology are too primitive for me .
you would use a bulldozer to find a .... china cup ...
colonel , wake your men !
indy the torches are burning out .
we got to get out of here .
sallah !
hello , hello !
why , dr. jones , whatever are you doing in such a nasty place ?
why don' t you come on down here , i' il show you .
thank you my friend , but i think we are all very comfortable up here .
that' s right isn' t it ?
yes we are very comfortable ... up here .
so once again jones , what was briefly yours is now mine .
what a fitting end to your life' s pursuits .
you' re about to become a permanent addition to this archaeological find .
who knows ?
in a thousand years , even you may be worth something .
ha , ha , ha , ha ... son of a bitch .
i' m afraid we must be going now doctor jones .
our price is awaited in berlin .
but i do not wish to leave you down in that awful place , all alone .
slimy biff , you let me go !
stop it !
aaahh ..
marion !
hang on !
traitor you get your hands off of me !
i can' t breathe !
the girl was mine !
she' s of no use to us .
only our mission for the fhrer matters .
i wonder sometimes monsieur , if you have that clearly in mind ?
it was not to be cherie .
you bastard , i' il get you for this !
indiana jones , adieu !
nooo !
take this .
wave it at anything that slithers .
oh my god this whole place is slithering !
indy !
aow , jesus !
where did you get this ?
from him ?
i was trying to escape .
no thanks to you .
how hard were you trying ?
where the hell were you watch it , watch it !
what are you doing ?
helping the fire !
how the hell are we going to get out of here ?
i' m working on it , i' m working on it !
whatever you' re doing , do it faster !
where are you going ?
through that wall .
just get ready to run whatever happens to me .
what do you mean by that ?
indy !
damn it don' t you leave me down here by myself .
indy !
here we go !
get ready .
indy the torch is going out !
indy !
marion !
look , look !
they' re going to fly it out of here .
when the ark gets loaded we are already going to be on the plane .
ah , monsieur ...
let us toast our success in the desert .
to the ark .
when we are very far from here .
du !
was machen sie doch ?
komm hier !
indy !
stay with the ark !
stay with the ark !
look out !
oh my god ...
turn it !
turn it !
it' s stuck !
never mind .
get back !
get back !
get the ark away from this place immediately .
have it put on the truck .
it will be flied out of cairo .
and gobler , i want plenty of protection .
jawohl herr oberst .
jones !
holy smoke my friends !
i' m so pleased you' re not dead .
indy !
indy , we have no time .
if you still want the ark
it is being loaded onto a truck for cairo .
truck ?
what truck ?
let' s go !
get back to cairo .
get us some transport to england .
boat ... plane .. anything .
meet me at omar' s .
be ready for me .
i' m going after that truck .
how ?
i don' t know , i' m making this up as i go .
achtung !
die leiter !
he' s there !
idiot !
idiot !
hurry , vite !
everything at last has been arranged .
the ark ?
is on board .
nothing is lacking now that you are here .
or what is left of you .
do you trust these guys ?
yes .
mr katanga ?
mr katanga , these are my friends .
they are my family .
i would gather it if they are not treated well .
my cabin is theirs .
mr jones .
i have heard a lot about you sir .
your appearance is exactly the way i imagined .
ha , ha , ha !
goodbye .
look after each other .
i am already missing you .
you' re my good friend .
sallah ...
that is for fayah ..
that is for your children and this is for you .
thank you .
a british tar is a soaring soul , as free as a mountain bird
his energetic fist should be ready .. " to resist a dictatorial .. " .
where did you go ?
i' m cleaning up .
where did you get that ?
from him .
who him ?
katanga .
i' ve got the feeling i' m not the first woman traveling with these pirates .
it' s lovely .
yeah ?
yeah .
really ?
yeah .
whoaaa !
what did you say ?
wait , i don' t need any help .
you do .
you' re not the man i knew ten years ago .
it' s not the years , it' s the mileage .
please , i don' t need a nurse .
i just want to sleep .
don' t be such a baby .
marion !
what' s this here ?
go away !
yes , it hurts .
oah !
god damn it , anywhere doesn' t it hurt ?
here !
here !
this isn' t to bad .
jones ...
jones !
we never seem to get a break , do we ?
what is it ?
engines have stopped .
i' m going to do a check .
what' s happening ?
we have most important friends .
holy shit !
i sent my man for you , you and the girl must disappear .
we have a place in the hold .
come on , go my friend , go , go !
where is doctor jones ?
let go !
don' t you touch me !
what about jones ?
there is no trace yet sir .
jones is dead .
i killed him .
he was of no use to us .
this girl however has certain value where we' re headed .
she' il bring a very good price .
hmm ?
herr colonel , that cargo you' ve taken ...
if it' s your goal , go in peace with it , but leave us the girl it would reduce our loss on this trip .
savage !
you are not in the position to ask for anything .
we will take what we wish .
and then decide whether or not to blow your ship from the water .
the girl goes with me .
it will be part of my compensation , i' m sure your fhrer would approve .
if she fails to please me , you may do with her as you wish .
i' il waste no more time with her .
i can' t find mr. jones captain .
i' ve looked everywhere .
he' s got to be here somewhere .
look again .
i' ve found him .
where ?
there !
tauchen , tauchen das uboot .
tauchen das uboot !
wier hren das periskop nach oben , herr oberst .
goten tag .
mde ? warum schlfst du ?
wach dich mal !
the altar has been prepared in accordance with your written instructions .
good !
get the ark there immediately .
monsieur ?
i' m uncomfortable with the thought of this jewish ritual .
are you sure it is necessary ?
would you be more comfortable opening the ark in berlin ... for your fhrer ...
finding out only then if the sacred pieces of the covenant are inside ?
knowing only then , whether you have accomplished your mission , and obtained the one , true ark ?
hello !
jones !
i' m going to blow up the ark , ren .
your persistence surprises even me .
you' re going to give mercenaries a bad name .
doctor jones ?
surely you don' t think you can escape from this island ?
it depends on how reasonable we' re all going to be all i want is the girl .
if we refuse ?
then your fhrer has no price .
ok , stand back .
all of you stand back .
ok jones , you win .
blow it up .
zurck !
