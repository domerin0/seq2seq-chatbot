i askedherifshe was afraid .
sheijustshook herhead .
i was afraid to touch the death lseen in her .
i heard people talk about immortality , but i ain' t seen it .
i wonderedhowit' dbe when i died .
what it' dbe like to know that this breath now was the last one you was evergonna draw .
lijusthope i can meetit the same wayshe did .
with the same ... calm .
cos that' s where it' s hidden the immortalitylhadn' tseen .
kids around here never fight .
sometimes .
sometimes when you see them playing they always fight !
is she afraid of me ?
little bit .
are you afraid of me ?
yes .
why ?
cos you iook ...
you iook as an army !
i iook army ?

weil , that don' t matter .

you' ii never be a reai soldier , not in god' s world .
this is c company , of which i' m first sergeant .
i run this outfit .
captain staros , he' s the co , but i' m the guy who runs it .
nobody' s gonna foui that up .
you' re just another mouth for me to feed .
normaily , you' d be court martiailed .
but i worked a deai for ya .

i' m sending you to a disciplinary outfit .
you' ii be a stretcher bearer .
you' ii be taking care ofthe wounded .
i can take anything you dish out .
i' m twice the man you are .
in this world ... a man himself is nothing .
and there ain' t no world but this one .
you' re wrong there , top .
i seen another world .
sometimes i think it was just ... my imagination .
weil , then you' ve seen things i never wiil .
we' re iiving in a world that' s blowing itself to heii as fast as everybody can arrange it .
in a situation iike that aii a man can do is shut his eyes and iet nothing touch him .
look out for himself .
i might be the best friend you ever had .
you don' t even know it .
he hates you worse than poison .
i never felt he hated me , cos i don' t hate him .
i love charlie company .
they' re my people .
they caii it " the rock " .
nobody wants this island .
japs just put an airfield there .
fighting' s confined to this area .
this is their road to australia , and this is their way of controiling the sea ianes to america .
if we' re gonna stop the japs ' advance into the south pacific , we' ve gotta do it right there .
the marines have done theirjob .
now it' s our turn .
worked myass off .
brown nosed the generals .
degraded myself for them andmyfamily .
for myhome .
i admire you , colonel .
i do .
thank you , sir .
most men your age would have retired by now .
it' s ok .
we need generai officers with maturity and character iike you .
we' ve got good sergeants and good iieutenant colonels .
but once a man gets those eagles , he can' t wait to get that star .
he becomes a politician , right ?
goes along to get along .
so goddamn hard to stay upright .
you said it there , sir .
with the admirai watching , which he wiii be .
there' s always someone watching .
yeah .
like a hawk .
always someone ready to jump in , if you' re not .
d' you have a son , colonel ?
yes , sir .
good .
we don' t want our sons or grandsons fighting this war 30 years from now , do we ?
no , sir , we sure don' t .
then you crush ' em without mercy .
you dig them out ofthe hiils and protect that airfield .
yes , sir .
you wonder why ...
why did the japs put an airfield there of aii places ?
i guess we don' t know the bigger picture , if there is such a thing .
what do you think ?
weil , sir , i never ask myselfthat question .
you' re a humble man .
nobody wants that island ... but you .
how much do you want it ?
as much as i have to , sir .

i wanna own an automobile when i get out .
what' s your name ?
edward , edward b train .
train ?
the only things that are permanent is , is dying and the lord .
that' s it .
that' s aii you gotta worry about .
this war ain' t ... gonna be the end of me or you neither .
think we' ii catch an air raid ?
how in the heii should i know ?
ail' s i know are them crew guys said they didn' t catch no air raid the iast time .
on the other hand , time before iast they nearly got blew up .

aii i know is charlie company' s always getting screwed .

and i can teii you whose fault it is , too .
it' s that captain of ours .
first he gets us stuck off on this boat where we don' t know a fucking soul .
then he gets us stuck way down in fourth place on the iist to get offthis son of a bitch .
heilo , captain .
i read in your 201 file that you were an officer before the war .
how' d you end up a private ?
cos of my wife .
i was in the corps of engineers .
we' d never been separated before , not even for a night .
i took it for four months and then i quit .

they sent me back to the states .
they told me i' d never get another commission .
they said they' d see to it i got drafted and that i for damn sure' d be in the infantry .

two mortars hit the beach , but most guys came in standing up .
darnedest thing i ever did see .
they got fish that iive in trees .

third platoon in reserve .
we' ve gotta cross those three folds of ground .
you see ?
once we get beyond that , we gotta attack that hiil .
colonei says there' s no way to outflank it , so we gotta take it head on by frontai assault .
whyte ?
yeah ?
see the grassy ridges at the foot ofthat hiil ?
yeah .
when you get to the end ofthat field , eliminate aii strongpoints on those ridges .
i' m sure the japs got something there to protect the approaches .

if they send us reinforcements , maybe we could scout around and iocate these machine guns .
anyway , it' s better than going back down .
something' s coming !
they' re coming !
what are they doin ' ?
if they want to throw us out , why didn' t they come in force ?
maybe they was acting on their own .
maybe they wanted to get into nirvana .

sergeant , i saw the whole thing through the glasses .
i' m gonna mention you in orders tomorrow and recommend you for the silver star .
it' s the most courageous thing ...
captain , you say one more word to thank me , i' ii knock you right in the teeth .
you mention me in your fuckin ' orders , and i' ii resign so fast and ieave you here to run this busted up outfit by yourself .
you understand ?
property !
whole fuckin ' thing' s about property .
what' s the matter with you , staros ?
those men should be reinforced immediately !
what are they doing ?
i can see ' em through my glasses .
they' re lying behind thatledge !
they shouldbe up and out , cleaning out those machine guns !
over !
i don' t think you understand what' s going on , sir .
we' ve had ... heavy casualties .
we had a man ...
his gut got shot out on the slopes , sir .
created quite an upset .
fine , fine .
now , what about those reinforcements ?
over .
i have ... two squads to ...
first platoon i can send up , sir .
over .
what the heii do you mean , two squads ? !
goddamn you , staros !
when lsayreinforcements , goddamn it , i mean it !
you commit everybody you have there and do it now !
your firstplatoon , too . lsee ' em lying on their fatasses doing nothing .
get a man to ' em right now with orders to attack , and move ' em by the flank to the ridge .
then get that second platoon over to the hiil !
have ' em press the centre .
go straight up that goddamn hiil !
attack them right now !
jesus , staros !
do lhave to give you a lesson on infantry tactics while yourmen are getting their asses shot off ? .
colonel , i don' t think you fuily understand what is going on here .
my company alone cannot take that position , sir .
the japs are too weii dug in .
they' ve got too much fire power .
colonel , there' s a bunker up there .
we can' t see it , and it' s ... it' s chewing my men to pieces , sir .
i request permission for patroi reconnaissance around to the right ofhill 210 .
i believe the entire position , sir , can be outflanked with a manoeuvre there in force .
no !
goddamn it , no !
mightsave lives !
there' ii be no flanking move .
listen , staros .
you' re notgonna take yourmen around into the jungle to avoid a goddamn fight !
do you hear me , staros ?
i want you to attack right now with every man at your disposal !
now , attack , staros !
that' s a direct order !
sir , i must teii you that i refuse to obey your order .
there it is , right there .
see it ?
i don' t see it .
this is not your fault , jim .
he' s ordering you to .
i again request permission for patroi reconnaissance around to the right in force .
the time , sir , ... is 1321 hours , 25 seconds .
i have two witnesses here .
i request that you do the same with witnesses there .
over .
staros , don' t puii this guardhouse iawyer builshit with me !
now , lknowyou' re a goddamn lawyer !
this is nota court oflaw .
this is a war .
it' s a goddamn battle !
now , i want that frontai attack .
i repeat my order .
over .
colonel , i refuse to take my men up there in a frontai attack .
it' s suicide , sir .
i' ve iived with these men for two years , and i wiii not order them aii to their deaths .
over .
this is a very important decision , staros .
but ifyou feel thatstrongly , maybe you have a reason , so i' m coming down .
go take a iook .
i' m not rescinding my order to you , son , but if i find extenuating circumstances when i get there , i' ii take that into account .
now , in the meantime , goddamn it , i want you to hold on untii i get there .
and , ifpossible , you get those men on the ridge outandmoving !
out .
one spot' s as good as another , men .
there' s no place to hide .
just take it easy , son .
take it easy .
take it easy .
where' s ... where' s fife ?
fife ?
he' s right here , son .
fife .
hold my hand , fife .
hold my hand .
i got it .
i' m dying , fife .
oh , captain ...
shut up in a tomb .
can' t lift the lid .
played a role lnever conceived .
get that blouse on , soldier .
it' s not a goddamn bathing beach !
put it on right now .
what you aiming at , son ?
let' s go get those son of a bitches .
move up !
what are you doing iaying down there where you can' t see a damn thing ?
observing , sir .
just sent first platoon forward to the ridge .
how many of ' em were hit this time ?
none , sir .
none ?
not one ?
doesn' t sound iike the situation you described to me over the sound power .
weil , it' s not .
the situation' s changed just in the iast five minutes , sir .
captain , you iisten to me .
we' re going over there and taking everybody with us .
do you have any more complaints or demurrers ?
no , sir .
not now .
aii right !
we' re gonna do things my way !
my way !
you understand that , captain ?
we' re taking everybody over to that iedge !
we may take that ridge by nightfail !
i think the ridge is quite a way from being reduced , sir .
show me how to see things the way you do .
show me how to see things the way you do .
we' re just dirt .
we' re just dirt .
we' re gonna get kiiled ifwe stay here .
beil , take six men and go see what' s up there .
and we' ii cover you the best we can from down there .
ok .
you guys , you guys , stay here .
ok ?
i' m going alone .
come out .
come out where lam .
there was a ...
there was a ...
there' s a bunker ... up there .
it' s five guns .
it' s five guns .
that strongpoint up there , somewhere up there around those rocks , is the key to this ridge .
beii here is quite right .
from their knob up there , those iittle brown brothers can cover the whole ofthe ground in front ofthis position for 1, 000 yards .
they' ve ieft this iedge unguarded .
now , goddamn it , that' s a mistake .
that' s a heii of a mistake .
we need to take advantage of it before they see their error .
aii right , aii right , i know you' re aii pretty exhausted , and we' ve had a heii of a time getting water up here .
for that i' m sorry .
i apologise to you ail .
but ifwe can reduce this bunker tomorrow , i think we can take this ridge .
so i' m asking for volunteers .
go back up there and knock it out .
sir ?
i' ii be glad to go back up
and iead the way back for a party .
right .
i' ii go , sir .
you .
aii right .
i' d iike to iead the party , colonel .
aii right , john .
i was hoping you' d say that .
you' ii be in command .
i' ii go , sir .
sir ?
you .
aii right , men , that' s enough .
seven is plenty .
gather up .
i don' t know ifyou realise the importance of this operation , staros .
once our position is secured , we can move the bombers in .
that means air power for 1, 000 miles in every direction .
guadalcanai may be the turning point in the war .
it' ii cost iives .
is that what' s troubling you ?
no , sir .
i explained to you the importance ofthis objective .
how many men do you think it' s worth ?
how many iives ?
i can' t say , sir .
are you prepared to sacrifice the iives of any ofyour men in this campaign ?
