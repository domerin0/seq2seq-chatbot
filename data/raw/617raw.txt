now , go easy now .
the injects take a while to wear off .
sorry about the restrains .
you have got one hell the right hook .
where am l ?
arcatic psychiatric hospital .
i find that i don' t like it .
for making a mistake .
my work is not a military application .
which work is that , john ?
i don' t know anything .
it' s no good in keeping secrets , you know .
charles ?
charles ?
i don' t mean to get you involve in this .
i' m sorry ...
charles ?
the portugal roommate reveal .
you saw my name on the lectures league ?
you lie , you son of the bitch !
who are you talking to ?
tell me who you see .
i did see charles running with the russians .
you people !
no one , actually .
there is no one there .
he was there ...
stop !
i don' t know anything .
stop !
i don' t know anything !
my name is john nash !
i have been held against my will !
somebody tell the department of defense !
my name is john nash !
i have been held against my will ! ...
what' s wrong with him ?
people with this disorder are often paranoid .
but his work ...
he deals with conspiracies , so ...
yes ...
yes , i know .
and john' s behaviours are accepted ...
encouraged .
as such , his nerve may have gone unfree in far any longer than it' s typical .
what do you mean ?
how long ?
possibly since graduates schools .
at least that is since his halucinations begun .
what are you talking about ?
what the halucinations are ?
one ... so far that i aware .
he imagined he has a roommate named charles hermen .
charles isn' t an imaginary .
he and john are best friends since princeton .
have you ever met charles ?
did he ever come to dinner ?
he was always in town for several times , lecturing .
was he on your wedding ?
he ...
have you seen a picture of him or talk to him through a telephone ?
this is ridiculous .
i phoned princeton .
according to a housing record , john lived alone .
which is more likely , that your husband ... a mathematician with no military training .
he is a government spy , flaying the russians ...
you are making him sounds crazy .
or ... he has his grip of reality .
now the only way i can help him , is to show him the difference .
which is he was real and what is in his mind .
come on .
what has he been working on ?
his work is classified .
he mentioned a supervisor .
a name of william patcher .
maybe this patcher can clarify things for us .
but i can' t get to him without clearances .
you want me to get the details of my husband' s work ?
john thinks i am a russians spy .
ls that what you think ?
what did the doctor said ?
i don' t know .
i want to see what john has been working on .
alicia , you can' t go into his office .
you know it is classified , alicia .
stop !
oh my god ...
oh my god ...
why didn' t you say something ?
alicia ...
i mean ...
john has been a little weird .
he say he was doing code breaking , yet that was only eyes only .
top secret , part of the military ...
was he ?
that' s possible .
i mean the director comes down all the time .
some of us are clear for it .
that was possible .
possible , but not likely .
lately he becomes much more agitated .
then when you called ...
so ... is this all these he had been doing everyday ?
cutting out magazines ?
well ... not all ...
i' m so worry .
i have to talk to you .
okay .
alicia , i have been thinking about ...
i let you realize the inability to discuss the situation with you .
i don' t have other choice .
i do understand .
i' m ... really sorry .
that' s okay .
everything is going to be alright .
everything is going to be alright .
just have to talk quietly .
they maybe listening .
there maybe microphones .
when i am telling you everything now , it' s breaking the protocol .
but you need to know .
because you have to help me to get out off here .
alicia , i have been doing top secret work for the government .
there is the threaten exist .
we cannot stop them for portions .
lnteractions .
my profile is too high .
so i just simply don' t do it with me .
they are keeping me here , because i tried to stop from doing my work .
you have to go to wheeler .
you have find william patcher ...
stop ...
stop !
you help me ...
stop !
i went to wheeler .
good ...
good ...
there is no patcher .
of course there are , i have been working for ...
doing what ?
breaking codes ?
dropping the packages at the secret mailbox for the government to pick up ?
how do you know that ?
sow followed you .
they haven' t been opened .
it isn' t real .
there is no conspirancy , john .
there is no william patcher .
it' s in your mind .
you understand , baby ?
you' re sick .
you' re sick , john .
john !
john !
code red .
dr rosen , code red .
observation room 2 .
john ?
john ?
the implant' s gone .
i can' t find it .
it' s gone .
he has the nightmare because his friend there .
he' s not knowing what' s true .
lmagine that he would suddenly learn that the people , the places and the moments .
most important to him are all gone .
not there .
but worse , they' ve never been .
one kind of hell would that be .
administering insulin .
how often ?
five times a week .
john always spoke so fondly being here in princeton .
and hensen is running the department now .
so he keep reminding us , reminding us .
yeah .
john won' t come here to the campus though .
it is a shame .
alicia , how ... how are you holding up ?
division has passed .
they are saying with medication and those dressing in ...
no ...
i mean ...
i mean how are you ?
i think often when i feel ...
it' s obligation .
a guilt ... over warning to leave .
rich , i guess .
john ... against god ...
but then i look at him .
and i force to see myself the man that i married .
and he becomes that man that he has transform into someone that i love .
and i transform to someone who loves him .
it' s not all of the time , but ... it' s enough .
i think john is a very lucky man , alicia .
someone lucky ...
this is ours .
this is it ?
it' s nice .
it' s here where i work .
john , you have a visitor .
hi .
hi .
i hope it' s okay .
hey , chief .
cigarette ?
no , thanks .
i' ve quit , actually .
hello .
hey , john .
have you met harvey ?
john , i ...
actually it' s okay .
you can have a little fun .
jesus christ , john .
i should have know .
here you go .
i can take those later .
you are suppose to take them now .
can i bring you something ?
i' m okay .
it' s okay .
so ...
i was in town giving a workshop .
i' il go back tonight .
you know bender ...
he really wanted to stop by ... and something like seeing you ...
you know , say hi .
i suppose that would be too .
but at last , i' m stop with me .
i' m trying to hold the remark on hypothesis .
i figure if i have dazzled it , they would have to reinstead me .
first , it' s difficult with the medication ... because it is hard to see the solution .
you know , john .
you should go easy .
there are other things besides ... besides work .
what are they ?
what are you thinking about ?
what do people do ?
slave , john .
activities are normal .
just have meaning .
you could try live in a house .
you know , maybe try talk to people .
you can try taking out the garbage .
who ... who' re talking to ?
garbage man .
garbage man don' t come at night .
i guess here around , they do .
sorry .
ls that the medication ?
my mother is going to keep the baby a little longer tonight .
i' il get three hour overtime .
i' m going to bed .
good night .
good night .
good to see you , john .
it has been a while .
patcher ?
yes , sir .
you' re not real .
of course i am .
don' t be ridiculous .
and don' t think that i will go that way , john .
it' s time for you to get back to work .
the bomb is in it' s final position .
here in u. s.
knowing your position , you' il keep a low profile .
we have brought it to the mountain , to you .
we have known the bomb' s location somewhere in the eastern seabroad .
but we haven' t able to pin point it' s exact position .
their codes have grow to increasing complex .
look at this , john .
what ?
what ?
dr rosen said ...
let' s get to the definite reality .
psychological bullshit !
look at me , john .
john , look at me .
do i look like an imagine ?
wheeler has no record of you .
do you think we list our personal ?
john , i' m sorry that you have to go through all these .
i' ve gone to a great deal of trouble to get you back .
i can restore your status in wheeler .
i can let the world know what you did .
but i need you now , soldier .
i am so scared that you are not real .
listen , i' m not coming .
i am just going to grab the laundry , okay ?
i' il do his bath .
it' s okay .
okay .
john ?
this is going to wet the baby' s .
oh god ...
charles was here .
he said it was okay .
there' s no one here .
charles was watching ...
there' s no one here .
he has been injecting with the insulin ...
i can see him because it was release in my blood stream ...
and my imply resolve .
i can' t tell you because it is all under protection .
alicia ...
no ...
hello , i need dr rosen' s office please .
you got to stop her , john .
you leave her out of this .
who are you talking to ?
it' s not her fault .
john .
it' s your comprimises again ...

alicia , please put the phone down .
i can' t let that happen .
yes , hello .
yeah , i need dr rosen .

i' m sorry i have to do that .
no ! ...
alicia , you know i have to do that .

she is too greater risk .

i don' t mean to hurt you .

charles is watching her .
with alicia .
i understand .
she never gets old .
marcee can' t be real .
she never gets old .
you see them now ?
yes .
why did you stop your medicine ?
because i couldn' t do my work .
i couldn' t help with the baby .
i couldn' t ...
i couldn' t respond to my wife .
i think that' s getting better than being crazy .
we' il need to start you on a higher run of insulin shoots and your medication ...
no .
it has to be another way .
gets to it is generative .
someday it' s maybe symptom free .
but overtime , you' re getting worse .
it' s a problem .
so it is .
it' s a problem with no solution .
and that' s what i do .
i solve problems .
it isn' t math .
you can' t come up with a formula that you can change the way you experience the world .
all i have to do is plan my mind .
no theory , no proof .
there isn' t a way out of this .
why cannot ?
because your mind is the problem in the first place .
i can do this .
i can work it out .
all i need is time .
ls that the baby ?
baby is still at my mother' s , john .
without treatment , john .
pathetics may take over .
entirely .
you are almost ready .
rosen is waiting outside .
i can' t go back to that hospital .
i won' t come home .
he has commitment papers for me to sign .
or maybe you won' t sign .
maybe you just give us sometime .
i will try to figure this out .
what ever you do .
rosen is right about one thing .
you shouldn' t be here .
i am not safe anymore .
would you have hurt me , john ?
i don' t know .
maybe i should let dr rosen try to determine .
rosen said you wasn' t tried to kill me or anything .
you will know what' s real .
this ...
this ...
this is real .
make me the partner to awake from the dream .
maybe isn' t you .
maybe it' s here .
i need to believe that something extraordinary is possible .
come .
hello , martin .
jesus christ .
i don' t have that one , my savor complex text on the completely different form .
i heard what had happened .
i wanted to write .
i tried to call you since you left ...
this is helinger' s old office .
yeah ...
i stole it from him .
it seems that you won after all , martin .
they were wrong , john .
no one wins .
please .
have a seat .
it' s so good to see you .
what brings you back to priceton ?
john ...
john , i' m sorry .
but you have to tell him .
tell him you are a genius , john .
tell him your work is critical , please .
ls there any chance that you could ignore what i just did ?
of course , what' s old friends for ?
ls that what we are , martin ?
friends ?
john , of course .
of course , we always have been .
alicia and i think that ...
i have to fit in to a part of the community .
that might be some good .
there are several attachments .
familiar places , familiar people .
might help me elbow out ... from this ... from this certain delusions that i have .
it is a lot to ask .
so i am here .
quite some of the people just say no .
but i was wondering if i could hang around .
will you be needing an office ?
no ...
no ... lcould just work out in the library .
this guy is trying to loiter in the library .
but he doesn' t have an ld .
why can' t people read their memos , huh ?
then he goes totally nuts .
shit ...
shit ...
you are not real ...
ls that what you are , soldier ?
some useless cold .
the local banned man ?
i am not a soldier .
you can handle by yourself .
all .
old , worthless , disguided .
there' s no mission .
the world that you are walking through , the world will burn ash .
you are not real .
you' re still talking to me , soldier .
there' s no mission .
i am not a soldier .
john ...
hey , it' s okay .
i just heard what happen .
i' m sorry , john .
i' m not a soldier .
john ...
hey , nash .
you are alright .
hey , nash .
ladies and gentlemen , great john nash !
john !
you should have seen those faces .
everybody' s staring at me .
john ...
you know that stress treats you the delusions .
i know .
but i don' t know the way how ...
charles was there .
sometimes i really miss talking to him .
maybe rosen' s right .
maybe i should think about going back to the hospital again .
come here .
maybe try again tomorrow .
john , you can' t let go me forever .
charles , you are a very good friend to me .
the best .
but i won' t talk to you again .
i just can' t .
the same goes to you , baby .
goodbye .
goodbye .
how is it matter if i' m on your course ?
it' s ... it' s an honour , professor nash .
ls something wrong ?
this would be my first class .
good morning , young lifes .
it' s just not going to work , john .
you' re just humiliating yourself .
it' s pathetic .
you' re being pathetic .
i' m ashamed of you .
are you coming ?
you' re going to be late .
dad , you got my book .
what ?
you got my book .
thanks .
goodbye .
see you tonight .
bye , honey .
do you just solve rima ?
what do you think ?
that' s an analogue for non communitive extensions .
yes , it is .
it' s just a piece of work , not so prodically , so ...
but ...
i believe i' m making progress .
you' re ... you' re john nash , right ?
toby collard .
hello .
i' m studying your record .
the one you wrote here at princeton .
to come up with something totally original the way you did .
you know , i was young .
i have been developing a theory .
i believe i can prove the extentions in covering space .
that everything ... everything is connected .
that is all part of the same subject .
when was the last time you ate ?
excuse me .
you know , food .
my wife , she loves mayonnaise .
thank you .
go on .
the factor is in two categories .
alicia .
i was thinking i am not a teacher .
classroom with 50 students could be don thing for anyone .
john , besides you are a terrible teacher .
i am a quiet taste , martin .
i was just hoping that there is something that i can contribute .
what about the ...
you know , are they gone ?
no , they are not gone .
maybe they never will be .
but i got used to ignore .
i think they are kind of giving up on me .
you think that is what' s like .
all our dreams and nightmares , martin ?
we got to keep feeding them to let them stay alive ?
john , they haunted you ...
they might past .
no body is haunted by their past .
well , goodbye .
john , i' il talk to the department .
maybe in the spring .
hey , nash .
you' re ... scared ?
terrify , modify , petrify , stupidfy by you .
thanks , professor .
goodbye .
have a nice day .
goodbye .
see you .
professor nash .
can you see him ?
ya .
are you sure ?
how is he ?
good .
forgive me .
i' m just always suspicious in old people .
see you next week , professor .
see you next week .
so now that i know you are real .
who are you and what can i do for you ?
professor , my name is thomas king .
and i am here to tell you that you' ve been considered to the nobel prize .
look at me .
i' m just a little stun .
over the past few years , your equal liberty has become a corner stone of modern economics .
suddenly everybody just about to like that one .
what about my work in some other project ?
some mathematic ?
the application of your bargaining problem to f. c. c. banned with auctions or to any trust cases ...
trust cases ?
yes .
i never would have princip on that .
i just lead some honesty to some stupidity .
no , you haven' t .
i would never had thought about that .
shall we have tea ?
i don' t go in there .
i usually just take my sandwich in the library .
come on , john .
let' s have some tea .
it' s a big day .
most commercial have my tea in the palette .
there was some northern lndian tea , that i enjoyed the flavour ...
i have not been in this room for quite so many years ...
things are certainly change around here .
i have a son that age .
harvard .
i thought the receivers of the nobel prize is to be secreted .
i thought you won' t have find out if you have won or lost .
that is generally the case , but this is circumstances .
the award is just substantial .
they require private funding as such ... the image of the nobel ...
oh i see .
you come here just to find out if i' m crazy .
find out if i' il screw out everything that i actually want .
strip naked like a chicken thing pours around the nature .
something like that , yes .
but i embarass you .
yes , it is possible .
you see ...
i am crazy .
i take medications .
i still see things that is not real .
i just choose not to acknowledge .
i could die after mad .
i choose not to and indulge certain appetites .
like my appetite to patterns .
perhaps my appetite to imagine , to dream .
professor nash .
it' s good to have you here , john .
it' s an honour , sir .
thank you very much .
a privilege , professor .
professor .
thank you .
thank you there .
that is most certainly unexpected .
thank you .
i' ve always believe in numbers .
ln equations , and logics that lead to reasons .
but after lifetime of such persuade ,
i asked , what truly is logic .
who decides its reason .
my quests has take them in to the physical , the mental physical , the delusional and back .
and i' ve made the most important discovery of my career .
the most important discovery of my life .
it is only a mysterious quest of love .
that any logical reasons can be found .
and i am only hitted because of you .
you are the reason i am .
you are all my reasons .
thank you .
i' il call for the car , dad .
are you ready to go now ?
oh yes , i am .
yes , indeed .
yes , please .
thank you so much .
thank you .
what is it ?
what' s wrong ?
no .
nothing .
nothing at all .
come with me , young lady .
