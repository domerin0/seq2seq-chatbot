all her life she had wanted to teach at wellesley college .
so when a position opened in the art history department ... ... she pursued it single mindedly until she was hired .
it was whispered that katherine watson ... ... a first year teacher from oakland state ... ... made up in brains what she lacked in pedigree .
which was why this bohemian from california ... ... was on her way to the most conservative college in the nation .
excuse me , please .
oh , sorry .
excuse me .
excuse me .
the bus ?
keep walking , ma' am .
thank you .
but katherine watson didn' t come to wellesley to fit in .
she came to wellesley because she wanted to make a difference .
violet .
my favorite italian professor .
nice summer ?
terrific , thanks .
who' s that over there ?
where ?
oh , katherine watson .
new teacher .
art history .
i' m dying to meet her .
who knocks at the door of learning ?
i am every woman .
what do you seek ?
to awaken my spirit through hard work ... ... and dedicate my life to knowledge .
then you are welcome .
all women who seek to follow you can enter here .
i now declare the academic year begun .
a shame you didn' t come yesterday .
it' s so quiet before the girls arrive .
just a few rules .
no holes in the walls .
no pets , no loud noises , no radio or hi fi after 8 on weekdays ... ... 10 on weekends ... ... no hot plates and no male visitors .
anything wrong ?
i don' t think i can go a year without a hot plate .
don' t you just love chintz ?
and look .
they match .
sweet , right ?
your room' s here .
my room is just across the way ... ... and amanda armstrong' s down the other end .
you grew up here ?
my whole life .
you' il meet my parents when they come to visit .
they visit ?
regularly .
what do you teach ?
speech , elocution and poise .
dinners are communal , so i' il handle that .
but breakfast and lunch , you' re on your own .
so ... ... we each get our own shelf .
i' il make your label this evening .
i don' t need to tell you , everything on our individual shelves is sacrosanct .
i just knew when we met ... ... we' d be instant friends .
be careful .
they can smell fear .
good morning .
good morning .
thank you .
this is history of art 100 .
we' il be following dr. staunton' s syilabus .
any questions so far ?
your name ?
why don' t you go first ?
connie baker .
katherine watson .
nice to meet you .
dr. watson , i presume .
not yet .
and you are ?
giselle levy .
giselle .
if someone could get the ...
susan delacorte .
thank you , susan delacorte .
from the beginning , man has always had the impulse to create art .
can anyone tell me what this is ?
wounded bison , altamira , spain ... ... about 15, 000 b. c. joan brandwyn .
very good , joan .
despite the age of these , they are technically sophisticated because ...
the shading and the thickness of the lines moving over the bison' s hump .
is that right ?
yes , that' s exactly right .
next slide .
this is probably less familiar .
it was discovered by archeologists ...
in 1879 , lascaux , france .
dates back to 10, 000 b. c.
singled out because of flowing lines depicting the movement of the animal .
impressive .
name ?
herd of horses .
i meant yours .
we call her flicka .
elizabeth warren .
they call me betty .
very good .
betty is also correct .
just because something is ancient doesn' t mean that it is primitive .
for example .
next slide , please .
mycerinus and his queen .
2470 b. c.
it' s a funerary statue of the pharaoh and queen ... ... originally intended to preserve the pharaoh' s ka .
soul .
have any of you taken art history before ?
no .
let' s go on .
slide .
seated scribe .
egypt .

could someone please get ... ?
thank you .
by a show of hands only ... ... how many of you have read the entire text ?
and the suggested supplements .
long way from oakland state ?
well , you girls do prepare .
if you' ve nothing else for us , we could go to independent study .
ac ...
i was in california once .
how do you get work done with all that sunshine ?
we tan in class .
really ?
no .
you know , not everybody wanted you .
i' m not naming any names .
these jobs usually go quickly .
ex students , friends of , you know ... ... the right people .
the person they wanted took a job at brown , and no one else was available .
so here you are .
you can go in now .
good luck .
your first class left a lot to be desired , miss watson .
and i' m curious about the subject of your dissertation .
you suggest , " picasso will do for the 20th century ... ... what michelangelo did for the renaissance , " unquote .
in terms of influencing movements .
so these canvases that they' re turning out these days ... ... with paint dripped and splotched on them ... ... they' re as worthy of our attention as michelangelo' s sistine chapel ?
i' m not comparing them .
have you ever seen the sistine chapel , miss watson ?
actually stood there ?
i' ve never been to europe .
i can assure all of you this is the place i want to be more than anything .
better discipline next class , miss watson .
hello .
it' s me .
hey !
collect from katherine watson .
will you accept ?
yeah , sure , of course i will .
hey , is everything okay ?
yeah .
tough , huh ?
well , how are the classes ?
snobs , right ?
i hate to say i told you so .
you don' t have to .
i can' t really talk right now .
i' il write you tonight .
so you got a fella ?
he' s ...
he' s there .
i' m here .
long distance .
torture .
i know .
come .
come in and sit down .
when lenny left for the south pacific , it nearly broke my heart .
we wrote every day until ...
he was a great man .
i' m sorry .
it was a hundred years ago .
i' m babbling .
i love lucy .
even if she is a communist .
the only thing red about lucy is her hair .
and even that' s fake .
desi said it .
winchell wrote it .
amanda armstrong .
i see you survived .
katherine watson .
just barely .
oh , good .
you' ve met .
katherine' s taken the third bedroom .
how about a little dinner before what' s my line ?
how about a little drink ?
her companion died in may .
companion ?
you know , companion .
josephine burns .
taught biology here for 30 years .
you' il love it here , katherine .
you' il see .
i already do .
i ...
honestly , it' s beautiful .
it' s perfect , really .
well , don' t fool yourself .
they have claws underneath their white gloves .
who ?
the alumnae , their offspring , the faculty .
you name it .
watch out for yourself .
too much independence frightens them .
will you please stop ?
oh , a word of advice .
don' t let those girls know that they got to you .
they didn' t .
good for you .
you almost convinced me .
what is that ?
you tell me .
carcass by soutine .
1925 .
it' s not on the syilabus .
no , it' s not .
is it any good ?
come on , ladies .
there' s no wrong answer .
there' s also no textbook telling you what to think .
it' s not that easy , is it ?
all right .
no .
it' s not good .
in fact , i wouldn' t even call it art .
it' s grotesque .
is there a rule against grotesque art ?
i think there' s something aggressive about it ... ... and erotic .
to you , everything is erotic .
everything is erotic .
girls .
aren' t there standards ?
of course .
otherwise a tacky velvet painting could be equated to a rembrandt .
my uncle ferdie has two tacky velvet paintings .
he loves those clowns .
there are standards , technique , composition , color , even subject .
so if you' re suggesting that rotted side of meat is art ... ... much less good art , then what are we going to learn ?
just that .
you have outlined our new syilabus , betty .
thank you .
what is art ?
what makes it good or bad ?
and who decides ?
next slide , please .
twenty five years ago someone thought this was brilliant .
i can see that .
who ?
my mother .
i painted it for her birthday .
next slide .
this is my mom .
is it art ?
it' s a snapshot .
if i told you ansel adams had taken it , would that make a difference ?
art isn' t art until someone says it is .
it' s art !
the right people .
who are they ?
betty warren !
we' re lucky we have one right here .
screw you .
could you go back to the soutine , please ?
just look at it again .
look beyond the paint .
let us try to open our minds to a new idea .
all right , back to chapter three .
has anyone read it ?
okay .
when your courses are set , and a dream boat you' ve met ... ... have a real cigarette .
have a camel .
i' ve got my courses , i' ve got my camel cigarette .
where is my dream boat ?
giselle , where is my dream boat ?
betty' s cousin isn' t good enough ?
i haven' t met him .
don' t encourage her .
he' s only escorting connie as a favor .
why are you like this ?
i didn' t mean that .
i' m just under so much pressure with the wedding .
do you realize november 2 is three weeks from now ?
oh , honey .
don' t have it .
don' t come .
here .
here .
i' m working on table seating now , so i can just erase your name .
can i see it ?
no .
let me look .
i can' t look for a second ?
you want to see where bill is sitting .
no .
that is over .
right ?
right ?
giselle , right ?
damn it .
do i look a little bit like her ?
like who ?
katherine watson .
you mean , " crap is art " ?
i think she' s fabulous .
well , no man wanted her .
she isn' t dead .
she' s at least 30 .
oh , no .
no .
i guess she never wanted children .
for your information ... ... katherine watson had to take this job to escape from california .
please .
she had a torrid affair with a hollywood movie star .
she came here to get away .
that' s ridiculous .
who was it ?
i don' t know .
who was it , giselle ?
don' t be a pimple !
tell me !
it' s ridiculous .
tell me .
no , it' s not .
you know .
you know something .
tell me .
it' s william holden .
fantastic !
i know .
who is it ?
william holden .
i know .
i know .
i' m late .
i' m ...
abject pleading , apologies , forgiveness .
is she giving you any trouble ?
if these girls can' t get back on time , know what i say ?
lock them out .
come on .
out !
i' m going to lock the door .
out !
bedtime , ladies .
bedtime .
let' s go .
bedtime .
hey , betty .
quiet time , ladies .
women like katherine watson don' t get married ... ... because they choose not to .
no woman chooses to live ... ... without a home , unless she' s sleeping with her italian professor .
you are so critical .
i am not .
of course you are .
you' re your mother' s daughter .
it' s a classic electra complex .
i don' t blame you .
i mean ... ... who wouldn' t want to murder your mother ?
hey .
how' s the harvard sweetheart ?
divine .
got an extra ciggie ?
did you do his homework ?
of course .
want to do mine ?
no .
this isn' t what i think it is .
is it ?
where' d you get it ?
from the school nurse .
it' s against the law .
oh , honey .
it' s a girl' s best friend .
a certain kind of girl .
meet the last virgin bride .
spencer is a gentleman .
and even gentlemen have dicks .
maybe i' il get one .
what ?
a dick ?
don' t be stupid , connie .
someone , somewhere , someday might be interested .
just in case .
just in case , i' il be prepared .
was that necessary ?
i was taught it' s best to speak honestly .
okay .
you' re a bitch .
we recently learned that amanda armstrong ... ... our nurse , has been distributing contraception to wellesley girls .
this revelation is disturbing to an institution ... ... that prides itself on propriety .
go , go , go !
go , go !
it' s been going on since the late ' 80s .
whoever wins is first to marry !
do the girls take it literally ?
only the girl with the winning hoop .
oh , look , it' s phyilis nayor !
good for her .
it gets me every time .
why the buggies ?
they' ve got their man .
they' re wishing for their babies .
have you seen this ?
what is it ?
it' s a front page attack on amanda armstrong .
betty warren wrote it .
by providing contraception on demand , our school nurse ... ... is little more than a cheerleader for promiscuity . " wow .
oh , they' re not going to dump her in a lake !
i' m coming , phyilis !
have you seen this ?
i wouldn' t worry .
betty' s just a young girl flexing her muscles .
so was lizzie borden , and her mother wasn' t president ... ... of the alumnae association .
would somebody get that girl a towel !
that' s her mother ?
apple , tree .
is amanda going to get into trouble ?
amanda needs to start minding her p' s and q' s .
the trick to surviving wellesley is never getting noticed .
ciao , mona lisa .
the big war hero .
he thinks he' s something special .
he sleeps with his students .
the gold is fine .
the napkin rings are vulgar .
the glassware should be trimmed with gold .
the little sugar boxes , gold and white , filled with chocolate .
no candlesticks .
freesia instead of daisies .
wise choice , madam .
no baby' s breath .
you already had your fitting ?
we' re on our way .
here' s the seating chart and spencer' s list of groomsmen .
oh , i almost forgot .
i spoke to him about reading the poem .
he' d rather not .
i said all right .
excuse us for a second , joan .
a good wife lets her husband think that everything' s his idea ... ... even when it' s not .
i don' t care if he reads it .
you will in retrospect .
now , why don' t you see if you can' t nudge the idea into his head .
i' ve been here now for 21 years , jocelyn .
i remember you as a student .
twenty four , if you count that .
so why the theatrics ?
we cannot appear to promote sexual promiscuity .
okay .
it' s about appearances , then ?
no .
all right , all right .
all right .
well , i promise not to appear to be sympathetic , progressive ... ... or what did mrs. warren call it ?
liberal .
scout' s honor .
i spent the better part of friday afternoon convincing the alumnae ... ... that your record was impeccable ... ... that you would no longer provide contraceptive devices ... ... and you' d make a public statement to that effect .
i' m not willing to make a public statement .
it doesn' t matter , amanda .
they' re letting you go .
it' s out of my hands .
and this champagne cup is in the wrong place .
and up and down .
and up and ...
katherine .
good evening , miss watson .
good evening , miss watson .
join us .
no .
good night , miss watson .
good night , miss watson .
and down .
very nice .
very nice .
hey .
heard about amanda .
i' m sorry .
she seemed all right about it .
i wouldn' t be .
they don' t give you too many chances around here .
oh , that depends how much they hate you to begin with .
can i buy you a drink ?
or are you here for dinner ?
how long do the marriage lectures take ?
get this woman a booth .
your husband is at a crossroads in his career .
he' s competing for promotion against two rivals , smith and jones .
to get the edge , you have wisely decided to invite the boss ... ... and his wife to a 7 : 00 dinner .
you' ve carefully planned your meal ... ... set your table and arranged for a babysitter .
oh , we have babies !
yes , and i have twins !
then , surprise .
it' s 6 : 15 ... ... and your husband' s called to say that smith , jones and their wives ... ... have been invited at the boss' s request .
ever the wellesley girl ... ... you keep your cool and understand ... ... that the boss is probably testing you as much as your husband .
what next ?
yes ?
file for divorce ?
that' s very funny .
but the thing is , it' s not a joke .
a few years from now your sole responsibility ... ... will be taking care of your husband and children .
you may all be here ... ... for an easy a ... ... but the grade that matters the most is the one he gives you , not me .
you' il need to ...
whatever you do ... ... don' t put the boss' s wife next to your husband .
why not ?
she' s screwing him .
is that where you learned to speak italian ?
in italy ?
yeah .
have you got a boyfriend ?
yes .
you know , if you were mine , i' d never let you go .
i wouldn' t have asked your permission .
yeah , they say you' re progressive .
a forward thinker .
are you ?
there are a lot of labels here ... ... l' ve noticed .
right family , right school , right art , right way of thinking .
well , saves the effort on thinking for yourself .
how do you expect to ever make a difference if everything is a joke ?
oh , katherine watson comes to wellesley to set us all free ?
come on .
thank you for the drink .
no , no .
wait .
i was teasing .
they have their own way of doing things here .
you' ve just gotta find a way to work with them .
we all had to .
i' m sorry .
five years ago , they' d have slapped my wrist .
but now there' s a committee for the protection of everything .
they think you' re dangerous ?
oh , no , darling .
no .
subversive .
it' s gotten to the point ... ... where you don' t know who is protecting whom from what .
or should that be " from whom " ?
well , whom gives a damn anyway ?
they' re doing me a favor really .
will you be all right ?
better than that .
i should really have left when josephine died .
nothing left to love here anymore .
so ...
hello ?
miss watson ?
yes .
i' m back here .
i' ve never been to this part of campus before .
where are we ?
no man' s land .
so to speak .
come on in .
what' s all this ?
different things different days .
people who inspire me , artists i admire , editorials i don' t .
so you came to see me .
you gave me a c.
i' m kind .
the assignment was to write about bruegel .
i did that .
no , what you did was copy strauss .
i was referencing an expert .
if i wanted to know what he thought , i' d buy his book .
miss watson , with all due respect ...
bruegel was a storyteller .
find the stories .
break them down into smaller pieces .
you might actually enjoy it .
you' re giving me another chance ?
so it seems .
is that my file ?
what' s it say ?
well , let' s see .
straight a' s .
until now .
president of the poetry society , captain of the debate team ... ... co captain of the tennis club , founder of the horticulture league .
i sound like a pompous ass .
yes , you do , but a very busy one .
and it says here that you' re pre law .
what law school are you gonna go to ?
i hadn' t thought about that .
after i graduate , i' m getting married .
and then ?
and then i' il be married .
you can do both .
just for fun , if you could go to any law school , which would it be ?
yale .
yale .
they keep five slots open for women , one unofficially for a wellesley girl .
but you haven' t really thought about it .
wake up , joanie , wake up .
wake up .
okay , don' t get up .
don' t hear what i have to say about tommy and spencer ... ... looking at an engagement ring ... ... for you .
you' re sure ?
that' s everything we always wanted , huh ?
we' il be best friends , and our husbands will be best friends ... ... and we' il have houses together and we' il have babies together ... ... and they' il be best friends .
you' re going to be mrs. tommy donegal .
when ?
i' il get the scoop tomorrow .
you go back to sleep .
the first part of the exam will consist of two pairs of slides .
please identify each of the slides by name , period and date .
then compare and contrast them .
you will have 10 minutes for each pair .
then you will write a 1500 word essay ... ... describing the stylistic differences between raphael and van eyck .
eyes forward , miss delacorte .
you have 40 minutes .
good luck .
excuse me .
governor .
another shot , please .
this way , please .
thank you .
excuse me .
this is quite the event .
i' m surprised i was invited .
well , look around you .
who wasn' t ?
you ever hear the expression " keeping up with the joneses " ?
of course .
mr. and mrs. gordon jones .
the actual , historical family they invented the phrase about .
good to know .
that' s him !
thank you .
good to see you .
thank you very much .
a beautiful dress .
hi , we' re so glad you came .
we' re together .
table 19 .
good .
holy god !
the governor is right behind you .

not at all .
over here .
thank you .
great band .
great band .
hi , katherine .
hi , professor dunbar .
i' m getting a manhattan .
like anything ?
no , thank you .
i' il take a jack and ginger .
he' s making his move .
i knew he' d go for her .
she' s too old for him .
she' s too smart for him .
hold that .
they' re playing our song .
what ?
they' re playing our song .
i heard you .
hi .
hi , giselle .
ladies ' choice ?
sure .
excuse me .
ladies , gentlemen !
quiet !
what' s this about the poem you wanted me to read ?
it was your idea , remember ?
i never said that .
ready ?
excellent .
well , i wrote this down , just in case you forgot .
it' s my favorite .
smile .
now , betty , i tried to think of a million ways to tell you how i feel .
but instead ... ... i refer to your favorite poem .
good catch .
you said it .
he' s a morsel .
miss watson !
he' s a favor .
remember ?
come on .
miss watson , i want you to meet tommy .
tommy , come here for a second .
you are so beautiful .
this is katherine watson .
oh , wow !
in the flesh .
she has not shut up about you .
oh , stop .
you know what i' m saying ?
i do .
you did something to impress her .
well , it seems you did too .
you make these especially well .
thank you .
i had a fella .
lenny .
you remind me of him so much .
he had this ... ... funny little thing where his two front teeth ... ... they overlapped .
he' s dead .
south pacific .
my parents say my future is right on the horizon .
tell them the horizon is an imaginary line ... ... that recedes as you approach it .
i think i' il go back to my seat .
i had a really nice time .
thank you .
connie .
is this the brushoff ?
no .
i thought you were , you know ... ... done with me .
why would you think that ?
betty said that you ...
i don' t wanna take advantage .
i know that this was some favor .
she did me the favor , not you .
come on , dance with me .
she' s too good for you .
maybe you' re right .
i' m too good for you too .
but i have lower expectations .
i thought we settled this last spring .
so then we probably shouldn' t have slept together over the summer .
stop .
you ready ?
do you wanna know something funny ?
lenny' s not dead .
not technically .
he ...
he' s got married .
he' s got a wife and kids ... ... and a mortgage .
it was all supposed to be mine , except for the wife .
and you ...
you don' t look a thing like him .
you ugly bartender .
stop it .
you couldn' t shine his shoes .
i' m sorry .
it wasn' t supposed to turn out like this .
it wasn' t supposed to turn out like this .
which way ?
let me just see here .
i' m not sure .
where are we supposed to go ?
i think it' s here .
come this way .
we' re almost there .
joe .
hello .
hi .
how are you ?
great .
thank you so much for this .
you' re a pal .
it' s a pleasure .
your timing is perfect .
there it is .
that' s jackson pollock .
in a word .
i was getting used to the idea of dead , maggoty meat being art , now this .
please don' t tell me we have to write a paper about it .
do me a favor .
do yourselves a favor .
stop talking and look .
you' re not required to write a paper .
you' re not even required to like it .
you are required ... ... to consider it .
that' s your only assignment today .
when you' re done , you may leave .
thank god betty isn' t here .
where did you come from ?
mars .
what a coincidence .
tom donegal came by to see joan .
so i hopped a ride .
why ?
katherine .
yes ?
have you got a minute ?
of course .
walk with me .
you going home for the holidays ?
no .
too far ?
too expensive .
but i' ve never had a new england christmas , so ...
our weather hasn' t scared you away ?
i love it here .
do you ?
i' ve been getting some calls about your teaching methods , katherine .
they' re a little unorthodox ... ... for wellesley .
we are traditionalists , katherine .
yes , i noticed .
so if you' d like to stay here ...
is that a question ?
more a discussion .
about my staying here ?
you' il have your formal review in may .
until then ... ... a little less modern art .
happy holidays .
and to you .
afternoon .
oh , hi ...
i hope you get that ring !
bye , girls , see you next year .
have a safe trip .
so , what' s the big hush hush secret ?
are we gonna hear the pitter patter of little spencers ?
stop .
they' il tell us when they' re ready .
are you ready ?
is she the cutest ?
you are the cutest .
come here , you .
spencer' s been made junior partner .
it is about time .
and it' s a significant raise too !
betty !
what ?
i can say that , can' t i ?
to tommy and joan ?
well , it is .
so maybe a family isn' t far behind .
let' s take our coffee in the sitting room , shall we ?
i' il help .
keep them closed .
all right .
beautiful !
you' ve got everything you' ve ever dreamed of .
you will too .
i' ve got a secret to tell you .
you swear you won' t gab to anyone ?
i got accepted early to yale law school .
to what ? !
why ? !
you don' t want to be a lawyer .
maybe i do .
you won' t switch cold creams without asking me , but you applied to school ?
on a lark .
we never thought i' d get in .
who' s " we " ?
miss watson .
she practically filled out my application for me .
you' ve got to be kidding me !
what right does she have ?
you' re getting married !
first of all , there' s no ring on this finger .
second , i can do both .
i can .
how does tommy feel about this ?
he doesn' t know .
no one does .
not even her ?
no one .
joanie !
betty !
you are this close to getting everything you ever wanted .
and this close to losing it .
i just got a call .
they need me in new york tomorrow .
joan and tommy are here .
can' t you leave in the morning ?
then i' d miss the meeting .
sorry , guys .
we take a rain check ?

and i don' t want to go through life not living .

we' re in a hurry .
but that' s really great .
congratulations , old man .
congratulations .

best of tidings to you both .
bye .
no , paul .
nancy' il have a heart attack .
she has these rules .
come on .
no .
why ?
i said no .
i' m not comfortable .
i' il make up the convertible sofa .
what are you doing ?
you' re not kidding ?
i just came 3000 miles to see you .
i' m sleeping down here by myself ?
stop .
stop .
stop for a second .
tell me what the hell' s going on .
i don' t know .
i feel like everything is getting away from me .
we haven' t actually , literally looked at each other for three months ... ... and now you' re here , and i have this ring on my finger .
which makes you uncomfortable too ?
the last time i checked , we weren' t on this track .
when was the last time you checked ?
bill ...
the name is paul .
i' m not saying no to you .
no , you' re not saying anything .
you never really do .
if you need me for anything else , my number' s on the refrigerator .
i feel so guilty leaving you alone after ...
i' m fine .
i have lots of research to do .
that' s right .
throw yourself into work .
i' il be back ... ... on the 2nd .
see you next year .
1954 !
sunflowers .
vincent van gogh .
1888 .
he painted what he felt , not what he saw .
people didn' t understand .
to them , it seemed childlike and crude .
it took years for them to recognize his actual technique ... ... to see the way his brush strokes seemed to make the night sky move .
yet , he never sold a painting in his lifetime .
this is his self portrait .
there' s no camouflage , no romance .
honesty .
now , 60 years later , where is he ?
famous ?
so famous , in fact , that everybody has a reproduction .
there are post cards ...
we have the calendar .
with the ability to reproduce art , it is available to the masses .
no one needs to own a van gogh original .
we do .
in the newport house .
but it' s small .
tiny .
they can paint their own .
van gogh in a box , ladies .
paint by numbers .
now everyone can be van gogh .
it' s so easy .
just follow the simple instructions ... ... and in minutes , you' re on your way to being an artist .
van gogh by numbers ?
ironic , isn' t it ?
look at what we have done to the man ... ... who refused to conform his ideals to popular taste .
who refused to compromise his integrity .
we have put him in a tiny box and asked you to copy him .
so the choice is yours , ladies .
you can conform to what other people expect or you can ...
i know .
be ourselves .
you' re a sight for sore eyes .
i would' ve been on time but , silly me , i thought class was in the classroom .
glad you could join us , mrs. jones .
we thought we' d lost you .
there' s an unwritten rule for marr ...
don' t bother .
since your wedding , you' ve missed six classes , a paper and your midterm .
well , thank god i didn' t miss the paint by numbers lecture .
i was on my honeymoon and then i had to set up house .
what does she expect ?
attendance .
most of the faculty turn their heads ... ... when the married students miss a class or two .
then why not get married as freshmen ?
that way you could graduate without actually ever stepping foot on campus .
don' t disregard our traditions just because you' re subversive .
don' t disrespect this class just because you' re married .
don' t disrespect me just because you' re not .
come to class , do the work , or i' il fail you .
if you fail me , there will be consequences .
are you threatening me ?
i' m educating you .
that' s my job .
miss watson !
miss watson !
what' s this ?
every year , the ars nominate a member of the faculty to be our guest .
the what ?
you' il see .
come by tonight at 5 : 00 .
adam' s ribs .
a very secret society .
wait here .
first , the oath .
please raise both hands .
do you swear not to repeat what you see , hear or smell tonight ?
smell ?
keep your hands up !
yes , smell .
i do .
it' il only burn for a second .
go on .
and now that you' ve taken the oath , we get to ask you whatever we want .
oh , is that how it works ?
and you have to answer .
who invited her ?
you' re in time for truth or consequences .
i go first .
why aren' t you married ?
well ...
that' s poisonous .
i' m not married because ... ... l' m not .
i was engaged to patrick watts .
everybody called him leo , and i never knew why .
he was the first person that i ever danced with ... ... or smoked with , got incredibly drunk with and ...
well , a lot of first things .
we were 18 and getting married , christmas of ' 41 .
then pearl harbor happened and everything changed .
everybody changed .
and by june , he was sent overseas .
did he come back ?
yes .
was he changed ?
they both were .
i' m sorry .
your parents ?
yeah .
after the war ... ... they didn' t know each other anymore , didn' t like each other .
he left .
he got a whole new family .
divorce .
what ?
yeah .
first on my block .
that' s a city block .
people change .
things happen .
it' s the same with me and leo .
he went off and married someone else .
and i got to go to graduate school .
ucla , right ?
which is in hollywood ?
it' s close .
anyway , aren' t you gonna tell everybody about , you know ... ... your big news ?
what are you talking about ?
she got engaged over christmas !
congratulations !
i' m sorry to blab .
it' s just so romantic .
how fantastic !
we split up .
what ?
we split up .
well , that was fast .
well , not every relationship is meant for marriage .
some are strictly affairs ?
bill dunbar .
he' d be an affair .
let' s talk about that , miss watson .
you don' t believe in withholding , do you ?
no .
i do , however , believe in manners .
but for you , i' il make an exception .
that' s what we' re supposed to do for married students .
right , betty ?
professor dunbar and i are not having an affair .
did you have one with william holden ?
connie !
she asked about bill dunbar .
how did you hear that ?
oh , it is true !
betty , i told you .
won' t you regret never marrying ?
there' s still time .
i guess i assume that i will at some point .
i' m not gonna plan my life around it .
neither should we .
i didn' t say that .
you did to joan .
that' s what she told me .
what are you saying ?
she knew you and tommy were getting engaged .
and she practically filled out your application .
i didn' t say that .
she' s been accepted .
now she just has to figure out a way to tell tommy .
why don' t you do it ?
you' re good at butting into people' s business .
funny , that' s what they say about you .
spencer , do i look all right ?
yeah , fine .
i don' t have a lot of time .
speed it up .
mr. grouchy .
all right , here we go again .
all right , go ahead , louise .
married wellesley girls have become quite adept at balancing obligations .
i baste the chicken with one hand and outline the paper with the other .
while our mothers were called to work for lady liberty ... ... it is our duty , nay , obligation to reclaim our place in the home ... ... bearing the children that will carry our traditions into the future .
one must pause to consider why miss katherine watson ... ... instructor in the art history department ... ... has decided to declare war on the holy sacrament of marriage .
her subversive and political teachings encourage our wellesley girls ... ... to reject the roles they were born to fill .
thank you .
slide .
contemporary art .
that' s just an advertisement .
quiet !
today you just listen .
what will the future scholars see when they study us ?
a portrait of women today ?
there you are , ladies .
the perfect likeness of a wellesley graduate .
magna cum laude , doing exactly what she was trained to do .
slide .
a rhodes scholar .
i wonder if she recites chaucer while she presses her husband' s shirts .
slide .
now , you physics majors can calculate the mass and volume ... ... of every meat loaf you make .
slide .
a girdle to set you free .
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
what does it mean ?
i give up .
you win .
the smartest women in the country .
i didn' t realize that by demanding excellence ... ... i would be challenging ...
what did it say ?
what did it say ?
the roles you were born to fill .
is that right ?
the roles you were born to fill ?
it' s my mistake .
class dismissed .
these girls ...
are you proud , president carr ?
yes , actually , i am .
well , you should be , i guess .
half of them are married .
the other half , give it a month or so .
it' s really only a matter of time .
they' re biding time until somebody proposes !
a hundred years ago , it was inconceivable for a woman ... ... to be a college graduate .
perhaps you should look back to see how far we' ve come .
i' m sorry , from where i sit , it' s just a different kind of corset .
well , we can all use a little support .
oh , like amanda armstrong ?
she broke the law !
according to betty warren .
according to the state of massachusetts .
to hell with wellesley .
i' m done .
goddamn it !
it' s brilliant , really .
a perfect ruse .
a finishing school disguised as a college .
they got me .
what do you expect ?
more .
more .
i thought it was a place for tomorrow' s leaders , not their wives .
calm down , please .
no , i will not !
i' ve got 10 more minutes .
meet me in my office .
meet me !
how you feeling ?
stupid .
deceived .
really , really angry .
change takes time , you know ?
you gotta let them catch up with you .
katherine , this place needs you .
i don' t know how the hell they let you in , but i' m sure glad they did .
the things i said to president carr .
she' il never let me back in .
she' s a pretty good egg .
what things ?
don' t worry .
time will heal it .
unless , of course , you want to go back to california and that fianc of yours .
we' re not engaged .
thanks .
sorry i interrupted your class .
katherine !
i wanted to give you this .
it was for christmas , and ...
then i met your man , so i ...
the sistine chapel .
david .
venus de milo .
and ... ... mona lisa .
thank you .
this is gonna be a three in one shot .
ready ?
you didn' t even try .
this game is probably a no no in the better homes and gardens .
not that i have ever been in the better homes and gardens .
have you ?
no .
no , i' m just an old soldier .
they don' t invite us .
what do they say about them though ?
old soldiers never die .
we just ...
they just ... ... become philandering italian professors .
that was below the belt .
that was unkind .
deeply unkind .
you know , i don' t know how i feel about being a rebound .
i' il leave .
no , you don' t have to do that .
i' il get used to it .
what are you doing ?
getting dressed .
i had fun , and i' m not looking for anything serious .
why don' t you come down here and we can discuss it .
but as long as we' re doing whatever it is that we' re doing ...
which we did pretty well , don' t you think ?
no students .
i' m serious .
i don' t want to teach a class wondering why a girl is wearing my perfume .
katherine , i ...
i need your word .
all right , you have my word .
okay .
now can we change the subject ?
talk about something a little more interesting ?
like breakfast .
you know , i make a mean blueberry pancake .
i just put that shoe on .
i don' t think i know you well enough for breakfast .
i don' t know about that .
so how does a guy get to know you better ?
well , let me ...
that' s a good idea .
is that a battle wound you have ?
i' m a sucker for war stories in romance languages .
well , that' s pretty easy .
yeah ?
i was in a village ... called san remo ... ... the krauts pounded us hard ... ... me & stan ... ... you remember stan ?
we were the only two left from our platoon .
we heard a distant cry coming from an abandoned shed .
when night fell ...
a trap it was ?
remember ... ... invert your nouns and your verbs .
hungry ?
famished .
don' t say we can live on love .
that' s how i missed breakfast .
what' s the matter ?
what' s the matter ?
phillip and vanessa mclntyre .
parents of a friend .
you wanna say a quick hello ?
no !
no , i' il be trapped .
damn it !
could you seat us in the bar ?
we' re only serving ... ... in the front part of the restaurant this afternoon .
miss !
miss stone .
this has been the most romantic weekend i may ever have .
ever .
and all that' s standing between right now and perfection ... ... are the mclntyres over there .
now , with the competition out there , a girl' s got to be able to move ... ... a few mountains every once in a while .
i could use all the help i could get .
come this way .
i fixed it .
no more mclntyres .
thank you .
thank you .
let' s not talk about this .
all right .
hold your breath and ...
and turn .
don' t forget to smile .
arms up .
move together .
faster , fran !
when you surface , smile .
come on , connie !
how about we have a girls ' luncheon this weekend ?
just us .
where' s spencer ?

i' m free .
i' m busy .
what are you doing ?
she' s dating a psychoanalyst .
oh , really ?
who' s married .
giselle !
sorry , it slipped .
are you in , connie ?
i' il check with charlie .
who ?
charlie stewart .
your cousin .
you' re kidding ?
we spent last weekend at the cape .
a little hideaway he knew about .
operative word , " hide .
men take women to the cape in the winter when they' re embarrassed .
he' s using you .
he' s not using you if you want to go .
come here .
don' t listen to her .
i love you , and i swear i' m not saying this to hurt you .
charlie' s promised to deb mclntyre .
she wears his pin .
giselle , you know it' s true .
i don' t know anything about a pin .
mclntyre ?
are her parents named phillip and vanessa ?
you know them ?
only from a distance .
good morning .
good morning .
goodbye .
good morning .
okay , wait .
no , we have an audience .
don' t look .
no , i don' t ...

put me down .
put me down .
you' re not coming in this house .
you are not coming in this house .
no .
bye .
good morning .
good morning .

how can you date a man like that ?
what if you' re wrong about him ?
what if i' m not ?
coffee' s cold .
row !
ride the plank !
row !
are your ears burning ?
i think the feet go first when they set the stake on fire .
what do you say , edward ?
should we have her back ?
she' s got rather nice legs .
who' s to say i wanna come back ?
what ... ... leave me here with all these girls ?
you' d think someone would notice empty trays .
you are good .
you remind me of myself when i was your age .
cheers .
he' s positively vomititious , giselle .
don' t be so sentimental , connie .
it was a fling .
it' s fine .
it was nothing .
hi !
pleasure to meet you .
would you excuse me ?
i' il be right back .
connie !
connie !
excuse me .
sorry .
connie !
charlie .
it' s been a while .
yeah .
how are you ?
i' m fine , thank you .
you ?
deb ?
pardon ?
deb .
your girlfriend .
with the very large ...
with the very large teeth .
with the very large teeth .
oh , did you think i didn' t know ?
connie .
deb and i broke it off last summer .
that' s miranda .
we started seeing each other when you stopped returning my calls ... ... or answering any of my letters .
okay , maybe i should go .
have you seen spencer ?
but i did see charlie stewart .
and he told me that he and deb broke up last summer .
and you told me they were together when he invited me to the cape .
oh , connie .
i don' t keep track of his dates .
they' ve been on again , off again for the past few years .
no , apparently they' ve been off again for a while .
for quite a while .
so ?
so you made me believe ... ... that he was hiding me .
either way ... ... why couldn' t you let me be happy ?
betty .
and we switch .
wonder teacher .
tommy .
how' s harvard ?
oh , not too bad .
not too bad .
congratulate me .
you set a date ?
no , nothing official .
yet .
i meant , i got into penn .
grad school .
congratulations .
what about yale ?
yale ?
oh , you mean joanie .
yeah .
how about that , huh ?
she is some girl .
she' s terrific .
yeah .
just the fact that she got in .
i mean , she will always have that .
thanks to you .
miss watson , you' ve been real swell to her .
we both appreciate it .
i' m sorry .
the fact that she got in , " what does that mean ?
well , she' il be in philadelphia .
with me .
well , that' s an awful long commute to get dinner on the table by 5 : 00 .
and we switch .
thank you .
excuse me .
excuse me .
have you seen spencer ?
i can' t find him anywhere .
actually , spencer asked me to take you home .
he has this meeting ...
in new york .
thank you .
honey , what are you doing here ?
i' m staying the night .
spencer won' t mind ?
spencer won' t notice .
he' s in new york again .
working .
he' s working hard for both of you .
don' t lie for him , mother .
he does it so well for himself .
you' re going to turn around , go home ... ... fix your face and wait for your husband .
this is the bargain you made , elizabeth .
we all did .
so you' re not gonna let me stay in my own house ?
spencer' s house is your house now .
believe me , it' s for your own good .
miss watson .
come in .
seven law schools within 45 minutes of philadelphia .
you can study and get dinner on the table by 5 : 00 .
it' s too late .
no .
some accept late admissions .
i was upset at first .
joan , the guests .
her fate is sealed .
how can she throw it all away ?
i realized you won' t have to .
you could bake your cake and eat it too .
we' re married .
we eloped over the weekend .
turned out he was petrified of a big ceremony ... ... so we did a sort of spur of the moment thing .
very romantic .
look .
it' s beautiful .
it was my choice .
not to go .
he would have supported it .
but you don' t have to choose .
no , i have to .
i want a home , a family .
it' s not something i' il sacrifice .
no one' s asking you to sacrifice that , joan .
i just want you to understand that you can do both .
think i' il wake up one day and regret not being a lawyer ?
yes , i' m afraid that you will .
not as much as i' d regret not having a family .
not being there to raise them .
i know exactly what i' m doing , and it doesn' t make me any less smart .
this must seem terrible to you .
i didn' t say that .
i ...
sure you did .
you always do .
you stand in class and tell us to look beyond the image , but you don' t .
to you , a housewife is someone who sold her soul for a center hall colonial .
she has no depth , no intellect , no interests .
you' re the one who said i could do anything i wanted .
this is what i want .
congratulations .
be happy .
sometimes i think you say these things to provoke me .
does your father know that you speak this way ?
does your wife know you' re here ?
where might i find charlie stewart ?
charlie stewart ?
c1744 .
but it' s too late .
you' il have to leave .
all right .
you can' t go up there !
what is going on here ?
there' s no women allowed in the dorms !
can you please not interrupt me ? !
connie !
what are you doing here ?
well , i saw ...
i saw big teeth with ... ... kevin tawil looking pretty cozy , and i thought that maybe ...
maybe you two weren' t ...
dating ?
yes .
thank you .
hey , no girls in the dorm .
i know i have made mistakes .
a ton .
but i never make them twice .
and ?
and it was perfect .
romantic .
we stayed up all night talking .
you' re late .
what happened to sunday brunch ?
we stayed up all night too .
not talking .
the psychoanalyst ?
again .
divine exhaustion .
he' s married .
he' s not married like you and tommy .
what does that mean ?
it means he and his wife don' t speak the same language .
spelled s e x.
does he pay you ?
for sex ?
at the rate you' re going , you could make a fortune .
betty .
everyone thinks so .
do you know what they say ?
they say you' re a whore .
once they' ve all sampled you , they' il toss you aside like a used rag .
betty , stop now .
the men you love don' t want you .
your father doesn' t want you .
i' m gonna meet you downstairs .
professor dunbar .
betty , that' s enough .
everybody knows that you hide outside his house .
it must be torturous running after a man who doesn' t care about you ... ... who' s in love with someone else , who hates you .
he hates you !
betty .
and it hurts !
no !
get off me !
quiet !
oh , god .
he doesn' t want me .
okay .
he doesn' t sleep with me .
he ...
i know .
i say no .
i mean , it' s not fair to her .
she' s not happy .
don' t forget about her outburst .
oh , that' s right .
dr. staunton , will you tell the alumnae the figures you have ?
enrollment for her class next year ... ... is the highest the department' s had .
ever .
she' d have to promise to turn in her lesson plans .
in advance .
and they' il need to be approved .
she' il never agree to that .
bill , the brochures for europe arrived .
surprise !
sir , i' m so sorry !
who are you ?
i' m stanley sher ... ... a friend of bill' s .
we were in the 37th together .
okay .
you must be katherine .
i am .
he told me you were a looker , but ...
i' il wait for you downstairs , stanley .
okey dokey .
so you and bill were in the war together ?
yep .
now he' s some fancy teacher ... ... and i' m in air conditioning .
forget the a bomb .
freon .
it' s gonna change the good old u. s. of a.
open the entire west to development .
i' m based in el paso .
oh , thank you .
and cheers .
well , you' ve come a long way from san remo .
yes , sirree .
that in california ?
italy .
where you two were stationed .
italy ?
well , somebody' s been pulling your long leg .
we were stationed at the army language institute on long island .
closest we ever got to italy was the baked ziti at mama leone' s .
i don' t think bill' s ever been to europe .
i sure as hell haven' t .
cheers .
katherine !
you okay ?
i met stan .
hell of a nice guy .
yeah .
what a talker .
yeah .
we go back a long way .
all the way to long island .
secret' s out .
what an incredible lie .
i spoke the language , i had the uniform , people just assumed things .
i didn' t correct them .
i guess i should' ve done .
i guess you should' ve done .
katherine , look , i' m sorry , okay ?
i made a mistake .
just give me a chance ... ... to straighten things out , okay ?
why couldn' t you just be honest ?
you don' t make it easy .
you' re so perfect , you ...
it' s impossible to be honest with you .
i ...
for you , it is .
well , it' s not just me , katherine .
joan failed you too , right ?
that' s an awful thing to say .
i know , but it' s the truth .
if you want honesty , i can be real honest .
you didn' t come to wellesley to help people find their way .
i think you came to help people find your way .
i' m not accustomed to hunting you down .
elizabeth , look at me , please .
i' ve spoken with mrs. jones .
there will be no divorce .
there' s always a period of adjustment .
i' ve assured her that you will try for a year .
look at this , mother .
spencer will try as well .
according to her , he' s really very upset .
you should call him .
she' s smiling .
is she happy ?
the important thing is not to tell anyone .
she looks happy .
so , what does it matter ?
don' t wash your dirty laundry in public .
let me tell you something .
not everything is as it seems .
it is with great pleasure ... ... that we invite you ... ... to return as an instructor ... ... in the art history department ... ... for the 1954 1955 academic year .
please , nora , may we continue ?
you will teach only the syilabus as outlined by the department chair .
all lesson plans ... ... must be submitted at the beginning of every term for approval ... ... and revision .
you shall not provide counsel beyond your own subject ... ... for any student at any time .
that you will agree to maintain a strictly professional relationship ... ... with all members of the faculty .
good evening , katherine .
hi , violet .
assuming you accept the conditions , we look forward to your continuing ... ... to be a part of our wellesley tradition .
nice party .
i didn' t realize .
it was a surprise .
william h. taft .
what does the letter h stand for ?
howard .
howard .
yes !
howard .
oh , it doesn' t matter .
the important thing is that you' il be back next year .
hopefully living here .
well , i haven' t really thought about that .
they just told me today .
well , there' s still plenty of time .
you should be celebrating .
you' re right .
you' re right .
let' s celebrate .
let' s go upstairs and get gussied up and go out dancing .
silly , it' s after 8 : 00 .
strike it rich is on .
life isn' t about strike it rich .
it' s a school night .

you made me love you .
you get all that from looking at paint on a canvas ... ... and it' s her facial expression ... ... her eyes that makes you think that .
i think that makes it interesting .
the context that it comes from ... ... affects the way we view it .
i think it provokes us because it provoked the painter ... ... and in turn , he' s kind of sending that message to us .
whether or not it' s a good painting cannot be subjective .
i feel like i' m missing something .
it was joan' s idea .

miss watson ?
i came to wellesley because i wanted to make a difference .
but to change for others ...
is to lie to yourself .
my teacher ... ... katherine watson , lived by her own definition ... ... and would not compromise that .
not even for wellesley .
i dedicate this , my last editorial ... ... to an extraordinary woman ... ... who lived by example ... ... and compelled us all to see the world through new eyes .
by the time you read this , she' il be sailing to europe ... ... where i know she' il find new walls to break down ... ... and new ideas to replace them with .
hold it , everybody .
i' ve heard her called a quitter for leaving ... ... an aimless wanderer .
but not all who wander are aimless .
especially not those who seek truth beyond tradition ... ... beyond definition ... ... beyond the image .
get the hell out of the way !
i' il never forget you .
betty !
betty !
what about after this war , lee ?
well , this job belongs to some soldier .
when he comes back ... ... he can have it .
oh , that' s swell .
