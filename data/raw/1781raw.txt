how about you ?
do you remember your mother when y' all were living together ?
no , not really .
i used to try to remember her .
anything about her .
like her voice , the way she smelled , you know , anything .
i used to think real hard ... wanting memories .
and i just started making them up .
that she was putting on her eye shadow and talking to me in the mirror ... or i' d pretend that ... she' d make me these perfect grilled cheeses with the crusts cut off .
i had all kinds of made up memories .
my favorite one was that she' d take me to see her shows ... and i would be sitting on the side with this nice man ... who' d give me all the shirley temples i wanted .
i made up so many memories ...
i actually started to believe i was really remembering her .
but she never came for me , so i just forgot .
you know ... stopped pretending .
ho , ho , ho !
is that a real tree ?
lord , where did you get that ?
it fell off the back of a truck .
like hell it did .
all right , maybe it was a volvo .
we should put it right up front where everybody could see .
sure .
lawson , where' s the laundry ?
shit .
i remember the day i graduated from protg to confidant .
he never meant to let me in on his secrets .
he thrived on his own mystery .
but once the first one was discovered ...
it wasn' t long before there were none left between us .
i was on the back steps of the library ...
when i spotted his uniform , a freshly laundered shirt ...
the color of easter , and that damn hat .
he strode across campus with purpose .
everything about tommy said ready .
i' m tommy , just so you can follow .
sounds just like you .
he almost skipped right passed me . " ' nice hat , ' i said ...
eliciting tommy' s notorious smile .
it was the same smile that he granted to each woman that caught his eye .
the smile that served as an answer to all undesirable questions .
or the smile for one of his children ...
whenever he found a tiny hand reaching for his .
that' s nice ...
but i think that might be a bad sentence .
i think they all are .
that' s why they' re hanging from the goddamn christmas tree .
no , but it' s just that , normally , it' s just not on ...
tommy took the stairs , two at a time , bellowing , ' well , god damn ...
if it isn' t the south' s next great native son . '
i was only one of hundreds who came religiously twice a week ...
to be dazzled by the professor , each performance worthy of applause .
tommy , at the front of the hall , waving his arms wildly ...
as if mastering an imaginary lasso .
i like " lariat " better .
i think you ...
i like " lasso .
years ago , you trusted my opinion .
years ago , you were easier to trust .
thank y' all very much .
have a merry christmas .
nobody can do the alabama shuffle as good as bobby long ... but this sweet thing , she can move .
why can' t you be this sweet all the time ?
sure , and what would that get me ?
pure , unadulterated joy .
you keep your lecherous eyes off our girl .
what ?
she don' t like me .
she likes lawson better than she likes me .
you like lawson better than me , don' t you ?
you' re drunk .
you know what , i am .
i really am .
but it' s all right , because lawson is gonna take us home .
not tonight .
i got him all to myself .
you told them about the news , honey ?
we were just thinking that maybe after the holidays ... he could move in with me and get some more work done .
it' s just something that we kicked around .
lawson is not in love with you .
bobby , i don' t think that' s any of your damn business .
i' ve seen him with a woman that he can' t get enough of .
a woman that' s crawled into every molecule of his being ... that consumed his every thought ... and turned him into a creation of devotion and obsession .
i have the scars of that love on my face .
have you told her about that ?
have you told her about the difference between true love ... and a warm bed to pass the time away ?
cool it .
don' t go after her .
i never said i was going anywhere .
i only speak the truth .
the woman deserves to know the truth .
and you , you' re free to do as you please .
am i , really ?
finally free ?
i want to say something on this occasion ... where we' re celebrating our love and friendships with one another .
friend by enemy i call you out
you there , with a bad coin in your socket
you there , my friend with a winning air
who palmed the lie on me when you looked brassily at my shyest secret
with my whole heart under your hammer
that though i loved him for his faults
as much as for his good
my friend were an enemy on stilts
with his head in a cunning cloud
bravo , man .
now , why don' t you come out and fucking say what you really mean ?
just to be anybody but who you really are ?
you want to tell me that you' re disappointed in me ?
' cause maybe i' m disappointed in you .
you know , i never asked to write your damn book .
your redemption and my penance , right ?
haven' t i paid ?
nine fucking years .
i am sorry , all right ?
i am so fucking sorry .
it' s dylan thomas .
to others than you .
that' s an easy one .
good night , bobby .
shit .
you okay ?
can i come in ?
you really did a number on yourself this time .
lawson' s gonna leave me right by myself .
i always knew it .
i deserve it .
i' m gonna die alone .
he' s not gonna leave you .
yes , he is .
no .
he' il always be there for you .
he cut up my story and hung it on the christmas tree .
honey , i peed myself .
all right , let' s get you into bed .
come on .
oh , god .
it' s so damn cold .
how is he ?
i think he peed blood .
god damn it .
i knew he wasn' t himself tonight .
he' s afraid of doctors .
it' s probably some bacterial thing .
it' s nothing .
are you gonna move out ?
no .
are you in love with her ?
no .
she' s really nice .
yeah , she is .
are you worried about him ?
what happened , lawson ?
when i met bobby , he seemed absolutely larger than life .
did whatever the hell he wanted ... but still he had the beautiful wife and kids .
students loved him .
faculty hated him .
women wanted him .
christ , he had me so convinced of my own grand destiny ...
i may have fallen a little in love myself .
we hung out all the time .
there was a woman who i wanted to marry .
her friend fell for bobby pretty hard .
he started spending more time with us than he was at home .
one night , their youngest had a little league game .
it was a double header .
so i convinced him to have drinks with the girls first .
said i' d go to the game with him later .
he kept on saying he had to leave .
somehow one drink became two , and then three .
and then ... this idiot , the dean' s nephew ... came in and announced ... that he was sleeping with my girlfriend ... and everyone knew but me .
i went after him .
he took a swing .
bobby stepped in ... and he cracked bobby' s face wide open .
bobby went crazy .
he beat up that kid pretty bad .
it' d just gotten so late .
i knew ben would be waiting .
but when we got there , he was gone .
everyone was .
he should never have been by himself .
he was just a little boy , and it was so dark .
there' s too many people ... in such a damn hurry on that road .
there' s no way a driver could have seen him .
i mean , he was so little .
and , god , he worshipped his dad .
juliette told bobby to leave and never come back .
she needed a better man .
that' s how she put it .
so you came here ?
seemed like a good place to write .
it was far away ...
good universities .
bobby could start over .
i thought i should be here with him .
i mean , if it wasn' t for me that night ... things might have ...
i don' t know what happened , really .
we read too many damn books .
there' s something about this city .
that' s all .
you should get some sleep .
i made you breakfast in mattress .
thank you , ma' am .
have we heard from the man yet ?
no .
should we get him up first ?
can you give me that shirt , please ?
thank you .
nice hat .
get up , old man .
i hear we gotta take you to a doctor .
and get that off your pecker .
what do you care ?
you' re slicing it up , anyway .
it doesn' t mean i want my book getting the clap .
i had the urge to read something likable about myself .
find anything ?
not really .
i didn' t mean to mess things up between you and georgianna .
i didn' t mean what i said .
oh , christ .
last night was a blur .
i don' t know what was said .
and i don' t want to remember .
come on .
good , presents .
yay !
merry christmas !
it was our home that night , all of ours .
we both knew we should tell her the truth ... but every day felt like the wrong day .
and christmas is as good a day as any to believe in fairy tales .
that night reminded bobby and me of a time in our lives ... we ' d both chosen to forget until she arrived .
it felt good to remember ... if just for a little while .
i' m so full .
me , too .
me , too .
i wish it would snow .
me , too .
me , too .
but i love the rain .
me , too .
me , too .
come on , man .
you gotta piss sometime .
christ , i can' t do it while you' re watching me .
i' ve seen you piss a thousand times .
well , suddenly i am shy , okay ?
piss right now .
christ , it' s probably nothing , man .
i' ve lived long enough anyhow .
lord , it' s cold .
it' s clear .
i pissed clear .
like hell you did .
don' t lie to me .
so it was a little pink .
i' m not going .
you got any short stories you haven' t destroyed by fire or scissor ?
my english final , i gotta write something ... and read it in front of the entire class , and there' s no exceptions .
fuck !
so you' re doing okay in english .
i' m doing okay reading english .
i' m not a writer .
what the hell are you wearing ?
what do you care ?
it' s lorraine' s .
you just let her stuff collect dust in there .
you' d rather freeze than wear your mama' s clothes .
this robe and the person who wore it ... is worth more than a hundred people who don' t appreciate them .
is something wrong ?
you gonna tell her ?
tell her what ?
we gotta take bobby to the doctor .
he' s still pissing blood .
he' s been putting it off for weeks .
okay .
i hope you' re not wearing them lady underwear .
i most certainly am .
they' re good luck .
besides , they' re gonna take them off anyway ... and put one of them backless numbers on me .
everybody' s seen my peter .
that' s right .
everyone just wants to see your peter .
and my ass .
let' s go .
what did i tell you ?
goddamn string draped over my ass .
where' s bobby ?
i made him that andouille gumbo shit he loves .
they needed him for some more tests .
is he all right ?
they think so .
they just gotta look at his toe and make sure .
well , then , maybe you might wanna invite georgianna over for dinner .
i think she' s working .
is there an occasion i don' t know about ?
i have a date .
really ?
that' s a first .
i figured it was about time i got a life .
great to hear it .
is that a new dress ?
yeah .
well , sort of .
i mean , bobby' s right .
there' s no reason to let lorraine' s clothes collect dust .
she was really tiny .
you should have seen me trying to zip it up .
just make sure it stays zipped up .
i' m a big girl , lawson .
i have been for quite some time now .
hey , is that an sat application ?
yeah .
my guidance counselor gave it to me .
i meant to throw it out .
what ?
if she thinks your grades are good enough for college , you go to college .
well , college costs money .
there' s financial aid .
i might have to go away .
you might .
i have to go .
isn' t he picking you up ?
no .
i' m meeting him somewhere .
you can' t walk home from the streetcar alone .
call me at ray and ruthie' s and i' il ...
no , i' il get a ride .
besides , you should spend time alone with georgianna .
you haven' t stayed over there since before christmas , right ?
you said you wanted to see more of the new orleans music scene .
i figure this is a good place to start .
i know him .
really ?
hey , sugar , what are you doing here ?
my friend sean brought me .
sean , this is junior .
great to meet you .
i' ve seen you play around , man .
you are great , man .
really , really great .
how come i didn' t know you were a badass sax player ?
well , i don' t play much anymore , you know .
i mean , i don' t have ...
don' t got the lungs for it .
how' s bobby ?
better than you sound .
you sitting in again , or what ?
tiny , there' s somebody i want you to meet .
this can' t be that sweet baby girl , purslane .
you don' t remember me , do you ?
no , sorry .
when your mama used to play here ... she used to sit you right over there on that stool .
and you was so cute .
see , my job was to keep you full of shirley temples .
you remember that ?
with junior .
you used to play with lorraine back then .
you were in the band , weren' t you ?
yeah , she and junior was our best night here , when they wasn' t bickering .
little purslane .
look , you come back and see old tiny again , all right ?
and the shirley temples on the house .
see you later , man .
you were really in lorraine' s band ?
of course i was .
i mean , everybody was at that time .
that' s just how it was .
lorraine and me ... we were close at one time .
i remember the last time she wore that dress .
it looks just as pretty on you .
i gotta go .
glad you came , honey .
why didn' t you tell me your mama was a singer ?
that' s so cool .
i don' t know .
it was a long time ago .
you want a drink ?
i' m ready .
jesus .
are you anxious to get home ?
unless you and purslane don' t want me around anymore .
you finally figured us out .
what' s the verdict ?
i got a kidney infection .
they gave me some medicine .
said i got to dry out .
what about the toe ?
it' s just a fungus .
got goop .
you' re a lucky man .
you' re gonna be all right .
of course i am .
but what if i wasn' t ?
what do you mean ?
i saw you with purslane on christmas eve .
are you sleeping with her , lawson ?
no .
how could you think that ?
because she' s becoming more fetching every day .
because she' s a young woman .
she' s got a crush , and we both know how nice that is .
she' s a kid , bobby .
she' s 18 .
my wife was 18 when i met her .
it was love at first sight .
nothing happened .
that night ... things had gotten a little out of hand ... and i think she was kind of frightened by it all .
she was feeling a bit lonely and cold .
well , my guess is that she wasn' t the only one .
just remember , she' s lorraine' s daughter .
you' re jealous .
absolutely .
shit , i ain' t worth this much .
fuck , no .
winter never feels truly at home in new orleans .
an unwelcome visitor that shows up long enough ... to remind us of what we ' re missing ... and leaves us just in time for us to forget again .
spring , and we' re still here .
how about we grab a bottle of wine ... and go down to the river like we used to ?
what do you think of that ?
remember that very generous girl who used to skinny dip ?
what was her name ?
i don' t know .
she' s born again now .
think we' il still be living together in heaven ?
byron , de sade , hemingway .
i' il be more fun than all of them whiners put together .
yes , i guess you would .
i really think pursey can get financial aid .
will you forget that ?
she' s gonna go off to some fancy school after we taught her everything she knows .
we' il still be sitting here getting older and uglier ... and any spring could be our last ...
god damn it , i wanna go to the river now .
why are you such a dramatic old bastard ?
i just want to breathe in every day .
happiness makes up in height what it lacks in length .
robert frost .
come on .
you know damn well she' il miss us if she leaves .
if she leaves , she' s gone .
final chapter .
end of story .
i want to go to the river now .
but i need peace and quiet .
i got so much to do ... to pull off this graduation .
i gotta write a short story , or poem , or something .
i can' t think of anything .
i' m gonna blow the whole thing .
i know you .
you' il be fine .
i' il see you later .
hey , babe .
i' ve been waiting for you all day .
lee , what are you doing here ?
how did you find me ?
you smell nice .
aren' t you gonna ask me in ?
i drove all night .
and i got you this .
this place really looks like you .
all those lady magazines ...
i don' t read those anymore .
i don' t have the time .
what are you doing now ?
you waitressing ?
no , i' m ...
it' s none of your business .
man , you must be doing okay .
no rent ... and this place definitely kicks ass over the trailer .
lee , what do you want ?
what do you mean ?
i just came up here to make sure that you' re safe ...
once lorraine' s fool friends get the boot .
what are you talking about ?
those guys that you had to share this place with .
how do you know who i live with ?
some lawyer sent you a letter .
which you , of course , opened .
their year is almost up ... and i' ve been trying really hard to better myself .
i' ve missed you so much ...
this letter says as of july 1 ...
i' m the sole owner of this house .
yeah , i know .
you didn' t know that ?
jesus christ , man !
those fucking scumbag losers lied ...
they are not losers .
they' re my ...
they' re your what ?
you cannot call them losers .
you think that ...
i have a real life now .
i go to school ...
a real life ?
yeah .
as opposed to the piece of shit life that we had ?
and i guess you got some real men in your real life , too .
men who lie to girls so they can have a roof over their heads ?
fuck you !
or what ?
are they getting something else for their trouble ?
they used you , purslane .
just like they used lorraine .
get out .
that' s just fine !
i came all the way up here to see you !
you' re in school now .
that' s some funny stuff .
i want you to remember something , purslane .
a weed is just a weed ... no matter how pretty the flower .
that' s just fucking brilliant , lee .
get out !
what the hell is going on ?
she must be cleaning or something .
she locked the door .
pursey , open up , honey .
pursey , it' s us .
pursey , honey , open up .
you locked the door .
god damn it , i told you this would happen .
no .
oh , god .
how ?
let' s go .
she needs some time .
two goddamn days and no one' s seen her .
she asked for the weekend off .
the trail is exhausted .
ray said she came in early this morning .
used the phone .
she snuck past us ?
probably on purpose .
you have not been very supportive in this ordeal .
you' re staying with me , aren' t you ?
you' re welcome to go elsewhere .
i can rectify this .
tomorrow she goes to school .
i' il set the alarm .
get up early .
talk to her on the way .
work this whole thing out .
we don' t have an alarm .
sweetheart , we' ve been waiting for you .
what do you think ?
it' s all your favorite colors .
and guess who helped ?
we had ray , and lke , and even earl .
it' il probably add value to the selling price , so thanks .
don' t know why you have to go so soon .
we' il still be friends .
it' s them i wanna get away from .
you know they didn' t mean to hurt you ...
why don' t you start off in the kitchen ?
i' il finish this .
my sweet purslane ...
i am getting well and can ' t wait to see you .
time seems to stand still in these places ...
but somehow too much of it has passed , and there ' s so much to say .
i write to you always , but never have the courage to send my letters .
i want you to have them now to give you our history .
i ' d like you to know your daddy ...
and to know that only i ' m to blame for the fact that he doesn ' t already know you .
i wrote this song for you both .
honey , where do you want me to put your glasses ?
what' s wrong ?
how could you talk about her all the time and never tell me this ?
is this true ?
your singing touched my soul .
bobby long .
i always suspected , but she never told me .
i loved her first .
and bobby got here , and all hell broke loose .
bobby was still married .
he never even knew how she felt .
she worked so hard to get clean .
and when she did , she came home for a big show at the howlin ' wolf .
this show ?
the date' s right .
she said your grandma would bring you up .
you never did show .
he never did , either .
boy , she was devastated neither one of you was there .
to my sweet bobby .
i am feeling better and coming home to sing you a brand new song .
please come .
someone i love will be there and i want to introduce you .
this was you , darling .
you and bobby .
i just ...
i can' t believe it .
why do you keep drinking that shit ?
don' t you know it' s gonna kill you ?
didn' t you watch lorraine ?
god , sometimes you make me so fucking sick .
you' re living in some fantasy world ... where life' s a book and no one takes responsibility for writing .
every idiot knows that books are better than life .
that' s why they' re books !
pursey , honey , you go right ahead and be wicked .
we deserve it .
but when you' re finished , why don' t we just all sit down and talk like a family ?
like a family .
would that be like that family you destroyed ?
are we just gonna be like that family ?
' cause the weird thing is that , according to lorraine , i am your family .
couldn' t you count to nine months ?
i never understood why she would want me to live with y' all ...
but you' re my father .
i just ...
did you love her ?
did you love her ?
yes , very much .
but i just ...
i wish we never knew .
no .
don' t go , pursey .
don' t walk away .
it' s too late .
no , it' s not too late .
you got me now , honey .
you' re not alone anymore .
let me be here .
what can i do ?
tell me .
what , honey ?
remember when i told you i made up memories about her ?
yes .
the really pathetic part was that i used to make up memories about myself .
like parents got lots of stories about their kids .
you know , like , " wasn' t it cute when suzie couldn' t say supercalifucking ...
whatever .
i mean , people remember a lot of weird shit .
like you probably got a ton of stories about your kids , right ?
yes , i do .
well , i kind of felt that maybe ...
i used to do some cute or funny stuff when i was little .
but the truth is nobody was really there watching , were they ?
honey , i was there .
sweetheart , i was there .
i saw .
it was never very long , but i was there .
will you tell me about her ?
yes .
every tiny thing about her ?
oh , yes .
and about me , too ?
' cause i think i really need to know now .
yes .
i don' t want to sell our house .
i love our house .
i just ...
i was so mad at you .
i' m so sorry .
i don' t remember how to do this .
i' il do it for you .
shit , man .
your foot' s blue .
i' ve been practicing wearing this shoe .
it' s just numb , is all .
i don' t want any reason for my daughter to be ashamed of her daddy .
now , how do i look ?
damn good .
how do i look ?
well , pretty good .
your hair' s sticking up .
there you go .
good lord , y' all look like regular taxpayers .
maybe i ain' t dressed appropriate .
you look fine .
your fly is down .
come on , we' re gonna be late .
are you ready to see our daughter graduate ?
yes , i am , sir .
it' s a day to count our blessings .
yes .
quiet , everybody .
quiet down .
i' d like to propose a toast ... to my very beautiful daughter , purslane hominy ... who is my very own golden girl .
cecil mentioned earlier that today was a day we should count our blessings .
and as i look around , i see that there are many ... that i have not given credence to .
i am thankful for a god that i had thought had given up on me ... and the love of a child who , god willing ... will be in college this fall .
and not no vinegar bend junior college , neither .
my baby' s smart .
smarter than her old man .
that' s for goddamn sure .
pursey , honey , you have taught this old fool a thing or two .
we shall not cease exploration .
and at the end of all our exploring ...
will be to arrive where we started ...
and know the place for the first time .
and that' s what you' ve given your old man .
and he is forever grateful .
now , come on up and give your old man an alabama shuffle .
play that slow one that i asked for .
some people reach a place in time where they ' ve gone as far as they can ... the place where wives and jobs collide with desire ... that which is unknowable , and those who remain out of sight .
see what is invisible , and you will see what to write .
that ' s how bobby used to put it .
it was the invisible people he wanted to live with .
the ones that we walk past every day .
the ones we sometimes become .
the ones in books who live only in someone ' s mind ' s eye .
he was a man who was destined to go through life and not around it .
a man who was sure the shortest path to heaven was straight through hell .
but the truth of his handicap ...
lay only in a mind both exalted and crippled by too many stories ... and the path he chose to become one .
bobby long ' s tragic flaw was his romance with all that he saw .
and i guess if people want to believe in some form of justice ... then bobby long got his for a song .
