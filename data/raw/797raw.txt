i' ve a bit of bad news .
your country has suspended all travelling privileges on passports issued by your government .
and our state department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the us .
that' s it in a nutshell , basically .
while you were in the air there was a military coup in your country .
most of the dead were members of the presidential guard .
they were attacked in the middle of the night .
they got it all on ghn , i think .
there were few civilian casualties .
i' m sure your family' s fine .
mr navorski , your country was annexed from the inside .
the republic of krakozhia is under new leadership .

and this apple ...
big apple .
big apple . ... big apple represents the liberty rebels .
ok ?
no more krakozhia !
ok ?
new government .
revolution .
you understand ?
all the flights in and out of your country have been suspended .
the new government has sealed all borders , so your visa' s no longer valid .
so , currently you are a citizen of nowhere .
now , we can' t process you new papers until the us recognizes your country' s new diplomatic reclassification .
you don' t qualify for asylum , refugee status , temporary protective status , humanitarian parole , or non immigration work travel .
you don' t qualify for any of these .
you are at this time simply ... ... unacceptable .
unacceptable .
unacceptable .
unacceptable .

so , mr navorski , i have some very good news for you .
what ?
i' ve figured out a way to get you out of this airport .
how ?
well , we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country .
if we can establish this fear with you , then the cbp will be forced to begin expedited removal procedures , to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum .
asylum ?
mm hm , asylum .
unfortunately , the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you' d get before a judge would be six months from now .
yes , and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months .
it' s the law .
you' d be released .
you would be free to wait in new york until your court date .
but , believe it or not , most people never show up before the judge .
so i go new york city ?
uh huh .
you can go to new york city tonight .
but , you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear .
fear ?
mm hm , fear .
fear .
fear .
from what ?

it doesn' t matter what you' re afraid of .

united airlines flight number 801 to narita is now announcing final boarding .
you can' t .
that is mine .
you can get so confused .
viktor ?
well , hi .
please .
how are you ?
good .
man .
i am so sorry about what happened last time , asking you out like that .
i' m so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30, 000 feet that when i meet somebody that doesn' t , i don' t know how to react .
let' s just start over .
yes , ok .
are you coming or going ?
i don' t know .
both .
tell me about it .
napoleon ?
yeah .
i read a lot of history books .
they' re long and cheap .
like 1200 pages for $9 . 99 .
you can' t beat that .
but napoleon ?
yeah .
he' s one of my favourites .
you know what saved napoleon' s life ?
no .
his ego .
ego ?
yes .
after he loses the battle of waterloo ,
napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of saint helena .
he' s very depressed and decides to take his own life .
but napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job .
his stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it , and he doesn' t die .
see ?
ego .
saved his life .
maybe he need glasses .
glasses ?
yes .
to read words on bottle .
poison .
it' s funny you should say that .
