yep .
well , what' s she look like ?
she' s , uh she' s got sandy blonde hair .

i' d be makin ' millions of dollars and ...
livin ' in a ... big ol ' mansion somewhere .
you know , soakin ' it up in a hot tub with my soul mate .

did you see him today ?
no .
neither did i.
do you need a ride ?
no .
i missed the bus today , but my uncle' s coming to get me .
oh .

right .
i i think ... just a little bit east of the cemetery is a good little area right here .
we should do it there .
don' t go down here , ' cause they don' t have any money .
so , how long are we talkin' about workin ' ?
what are you you' re already losing your steam ?
no .
i just i have a chat room meeting at 4 : 00 .
i gotta be back here by then .
all right , you just start a little earlier .
that' s all .
all right .
or else work afterwards .
how long' s the chat room ?
geez , sometimes up to three , four hours maybe .
maybe not .
i don' t know .
you you pay the bills for that ?
does that cost money every time you' re on , like for minutes on the phone ?
yeah .
grandma' s still payin ' per minute .
she gets kind of pissed at me sometimes ' cause i' m on there so long .
i' il bet she does .
i' d be throwin ' you out the window .
bueno .
hello ?
who' s this ?
napoleon dynamite .
who ?
napoleon dynamite .
i' m one of pedro' s best friends .
your name is napoleon ?
yes .
is pedro there ?
no , he' s not here right now .
okay , bye .
see , crystal street .
that' s for you .
i' m goin' to adams park .
they got some money in adams park .
what ?
let' s go , kipper .
i think we should take this ...
someplace a little more private .
that' s a good idea .
please .
please .
be good to me .
please , keep going .
dead on .
dead on .
yes !
before we get started on our new project , i have a few concerns .
first off , i' m concerned about your transportation situation .
i mean , do you you got a car you can borrow from someone ?
well , that' s the problem right now .
at the moment , nothing comes to mind .
you can borrow my van for the time being .
i i do better on foot anyway .
we also need some way to make us look official , like we got all the answers .
how about some gold bracelets ?
we need , like , some name tags ... with our picture on it , all laminated and whatnot .
i mean , we gotta look legit , man .
that' s true .
that' s true .
say, you know of a a place we can get our picture taken ...
like a a photo store ?
okay .
turn your head on more of a slant .
now , make a fist ... and slowly ease it up underneath your chin .
this is looking really good .
you can say that again .
okay , hold still right there .
now, just imagine you' re weightless .
you' re in the middle of the ocean ... surrounded by tiny little sea horses .
that was the one .
i think that' s gonna come out really nice .
uh , you did it ?
wow .
wow , that felt really relaxed .
thanks , deb .
you' re up , kip .
is there some kind of vest that i can wear ?
where have you been ?
i got sick .
has summer said anything to you yet ?
no , not yet .
well , she said no .
she did ?
well , what about that other girl ?
what other girl ?
the one that left all that crap on your porch .
you mean deb ?
yes , her .
what about her ?
well , i asked her out too .
what ?
well , nobody' s gonna go out with me .
have you asked anybody yet ?
no , but who would ?
i don' t even have any good skills .
what do you mean ?
you know , like ... nunchaku skills , bow hunting skills ... computer hacking skills .
girls only want boyfriends who have great skills .
aren' t you pretty good at drawing , like ... animals and warriors and stuff ?
yes .
probably the best that i know of .
just draw a picture of the girl you want to take out ... and give it to her for , like , a gift or something .
that' s a pretty good idea .
now , if you invest in the 24 piece set ...
i' m gonna throw in a little gift .
so , what' s the gift ?
i bet you folks don' t have one of these .
i want that .
you see , this ain' t your run of the mill " crapper ware .
these are some serious " nupont " fiber woven bowls .
so , if we purchase the 24 piece set ... the mini sailboat is included ?
that' s correct , sir .
lance, you look like a strong young pup .
why don' t you see if you can give that a nice tear .
don' t hurt yourself now .
i can' t do it .
can' t .
so , uh ... how does the " dealio " sound to you ?
dang it .
is trisha here ?
oh , i' m sorry , she' s not .
she' s at a friend' s house right now .
well , hey , napoleon .
napoleon' s my nephew .
oh , that' s nice .
could you just give this to her for me ?
i certainly could .
thanks .
bye bye .
poor kid .
i' ve been takin ' care of him while his grandma' s in the hospital .
he still wets the bed and everything .
you' re kidding .
yeah , he' s a tender little guy .
he still gets beat up and whatnot .
anyway , uh ... so we still feelin ' pretty good about this , uh , 32 piece set here ?
ow !
what the crap was uncle rico doin ' at my girlfriend' s house ?
napoleon , let go of me !
i think you' re bruisin ' my neck meat !
fine .
what the heck are you guys doin ' ?
tryin ' to ruin my life and make me look like a friggin ' idiot ?
i' m out makin ' some sweet moola with uncle rico .
geez , i think you ripped my mole off .
i did ?
yeah , is it bleeding ?
a little bit .
hey , kip .
i wish you wouldn' t look at me like that , napoleon .
i wish you' d get out of my life and shut up .
i' m gonna tell you somethin ' .
while you' re playin ' patty cake with your friend pedro ... your uncle rico ... is makin ' 120 bucks .
i could make that much money in five seconds .
geez .
yeah , right , napoleon .
i made , like , 75 bucks today .
napoleon , it looks like you don' t have a job .
so why don' t you get out there and feed tina .
why don' t you go eat a " decroded " piece of crap .
there' s a lot more where this came from ... if you go to the dance with me .
yours truly , napoleon dynamite .
you know you' re gonna go to that dance with that boy .
by noon i need them 8, 000 hens moved into their new cages .
sometimes they don' t want to cooperate .
but you give ' em a good shakin ' , they' il settle down for ya .
do the chickens have large talons ?
do they have what ?
large talons .
i don' t understand a word you just said .
okay, you meet me back here about noon , and , uh ... we' il have a little lunch waitin ' for ya .
ew !
well , dig in .
over there , in that pigpen ...
i found a couple of shoshoni arrowheads .
can' t find my checkbook .
hope you don' t mind i pay you in change .
six dollars .
that' s , like , a dollar an hour .
hello ?
hi .
is napoleon there ?
yes .
can i talk to him ?
you already are .
oh .
napoleon , this is trisha .
i' m just calling to tell you that ...
i can go to the dance with you .
and also ...
i wanted to thank you for the beautiful drawing you did of me .
it' s hanging in my bedroom .
really ?
took me , like , three hours to finish the shading on your upper lip .
it' s probably the best drawing i' ve ever done .
yeah , it' s really ... nice .
yeah , well , i' il probably pick you up at 6 : 00 for the dance .
is that okay ?
that' s fine .
okay , bye .
bye .
who was that ?
trisha .
who' s she ?
my woman i' m takin ' to the dance .
you draw her a picture ?
heck , yes , i did !
well , what are you going to wear to the dance ?
just , like , a silk shirt or something .
what are you gonna wear ?
dad has something for me .
but you should probably get a suit .
pedro , how do you feel about that one ?
it looks nice .
yeah .
it looks pretty sweet .
it looks awesome .
that suit , it' s it' s incredible .
i need you to give me a ride in an hour .
where to ?
the dance .
you takin ' my client' s daughter ?
yes .
we need to pick her up too .
well , uncle rico' s got a sale to finalize in bonita in five minutes .
can' t you take me and then drop me off when you' re done or whatever ?
well , i' il be back in a minute .
don' t disturb me while i' m in there .
well , hurry up , ' cause i gotta get trisha .
hi .
i got your 24 piece set right here .
so you guys are , like , pedro' s cousins with all the sweet hookups ?
simon .
is trisha here ?
who' s that in my driveway ?
that' s my ride .
do you wanna go over by my friend pedro and dance really quick ?
napoleon .
when did you get here ?
just a couple minutes ago .
have you guys seen trisha anywhere ?
no .
oh .
she probably just went to the bathroom .
are you guys having a killer time ?
yes .
if you can' t find trisha , i' il let you dance with deb for a few songs .
i like your sleeves .
they' re real big .
thank you .
i made them myself .
so you and pedro are getting really serious now ?
no .
we' re just friends .
huh .
how your glamour shots been going lately ?
pretty good .
i could do a personal portrait sometime ... if you wanted to come over .
okay .
do you think people will vote for me ?
heck , yes .
i' d vote for you .
like , what are my skills ?
well , you have a sweet bike ... and you' re really good at hookin ' up with chicks .
plus you' re , like , the only guy at school who has a mustache .
that' s true .
if you need to use any of my skills , i can do whatever you want .
thanks .
if i win , you can be my secretary or something .
sweet !
plus i could be your bodyguard too .
or , like , secret service captain or ... whatever .
okay .
is that yours ?
don' t touch it .
it' s uncle rico' s .
what' s it for ?
it' s a time machine , napoleon .
he bought it online .
yeah , right .
it works , napoleon .
you don' t even know .

no .
so , are you ready ?
yeah .
hold on .
i forgot to put in the crystals .
okay , turn it on .

turn it off ! .
turn it off ! .
it' s a piece of crap .
it doesn' t work .
well , i could' ve told you that .
i i said the 12 pack , not the 24 pack .
you' re just gonna have to mix and match .
shut up .
say it so the whole world can hear .
well , put it back .
napoleon , you know we can' t afford the fun pack .

i can tell you that .
we can use those .
the defect in that one is bleach .
that' s correct .
yes !
this tastes like the cow got into an onion patch .

well , when i came home from school , my head started to get really hot .
so i drank some cold water , but it didn' t do nothing .
so i laid in the bathtub for a while ... but then i realized that it was my hair that was making my head so hot .
so i went into my kitchen , and i shaved it all off .
i don' t want anyone to see .
i know what you mean .

napoleon , i' m sure there' s a babe out there for you too .
peace out .

is this what you were looking for ?
nah , i was thinkin' of somethin ' a little more ... soft around the edges .
hmm .
well ...
i have a nice , soft pink sheet i could hang ... and i could wrap you in some foam or ... something billowy ?
yeah , billowy' s good .
it' d be really nice ... if i could get the fan going .
i could hang some tinsel from the top .
you know , deborah , you have ... striking features .
such a soft face should be complimented with a ... soft body .
mr. rico ?
my friends and clients , they call me " uncle rico .
what are you doing ?
shh .
don' t say another word .
napoleon told me you' d be interested .
napoleon ?
you stop wishin ' , and call me when you' re ready .
hello ?
napoleon ?
yeah .
who' s this ?
it' s deb ... and i' m calling to let you know i think you' re a shallow friend .
what the heck are you even talkin ' about ?
don' t lie , napoleon .
your uncle rico made it very clear how you feel about me .
what ?
i don' t need herbal enhancers to feel good about myself .
and if you' re so concerned about that , why don' t you try eating some yourself ?
right on .
grandma just called and said you' re supposed to go home .
she didn' t tell me anything .
too bad .
she says she doesn' t want you here ... when she gets back because you' ve been ruining everybody' s lives and eatin ' all our steak .
i' m not goin ' anywhere , napoleon .
get off my property !
it' s a free country .
i can do whatever i want .
get off my property , or i' il call the cops on you .
well , then do it .
go on .
maybe i will .
gosh !
hello ?
pedro ?
how' s it goin ' ?
good .
deb just called me .
she pretty much hates me by now .
why ?
' cause my uncle rico' s an idiot !
do you have anything to give to her ?
no , not unless she likes fish .
are you still gonna give your speech tomorrow ?
yes .
do you already know what you' re gonna say ?
yes ... but not all of it .
just tell ' em that ... their wildest dreams will come true if they vote for you .
i' il see you tomorrow , pedro .
dang it . !
what do you think you' re doing ?
now , if you look right here , we have sallyjohnson from manitou , colorado .
would you like to read her testimonial right there ?
sure .
um ...
after using bust must plus , i have such big bosoms
i don' t feel comfortable reading this .
oh , that' s fine .
that' s fine .
but do you feel comfortable with me ?
you could be ... somewhere around , uh ... here .
come here , boy . !
well , i never thought i would make it here today .
i would be a great class president because ...
i promise to put two new pop machines in the cafeteria , and ...
i' m also gonna get a glitter bonnebell dispenser for all the girls' bathrooms .
oh , we' re gonna get new cheerleading uniforms .
anyway , i think i' d be a great class president , so , uh ... who wants to eat " chimini changas ' " next year ?
not me .
see , with me , it will be summer all year long .
vote for summer .
and now summer will perform her skit with members of our very own happy hands club .
your speech is up next .
your skit had better be pretty good .
a skit ?
you perform a skit after your speech , pedro .
what ?
a flippin ' skit ?
why didn' t anybody tell us about this ?
i don' t want to be president anyway .
pedro, just listen to your heart .
that' s what i do .
i' il just tell them that i have nothing to say .
hello .
i don' t have much to say .
but i think it would be good to have some holy santos brought to the high school ... to guard the hallway and to bring us good luck .
el santo nino de atocha is a good one .
my aunt concha has seen him .
and ... we have a great f. f. a. schedule lined up and i' d like to see more of that .
if you vote for me , all of your wildest dreams will come true .
thank you .
up next , i hope you' il enjoy a skit by pedro sanchez .
oh .
i caught you a delicious bass .
you wanna play me ?
i , uh , would like to give you this advice .
and a fella give me some years ago .
he said , " when an argument arises ...
if you go outside and take , uh , a nice walk ...
you' il calm down and then you can come back and it won' t be an argument .
and you' il find that helps your health .
all that fresh air and exercise will do you a lot of good .
is there anything else you' d like to ask about ?
pedro .
where the heck' s napoleon ?
i don' t know .
lafawnduh lucas , do you take kipland ronald dynamite ... to be your lawful wedded husband ... to honor in sickness and health till death do you part ?
