shots fired .
detectives pruitt and biggs are trying a side entrance .

you never heard of slacks ?
screw you .

and then ?
my husband , he called 91 1 .
then they take him hostage .
ln six months you' il be back with a badge .

what ?
you got some sudden yearning for boredom ?
life , roy .
i got a yearning for life .

i' m gonna start a family .
you were born to be a detective , pru .
it' s in your blood .
i don' t want it anymore .
last chance !
you were born to be a detective , pru .
do you want to talk about what happened ?
sometimes it' s better if i don' t tell you everything .
i know it must be hard for you to leave .
i love that we' re leaving here .
i love that we' re never coming back .
now , why is there sleeping bags in the trunk of my car ?
well , you know , sometimes it' s better if i just don' t tell you everything .
i forgot how far it was .
are you tired ?
a little .
we' il stop soon , get a drink .
you wanna get me drunk , have your way with me .
that' s the current plan .

no , less .
it' s a lot further than that .
wait .
wait .
no , wait .
look .
that' s beautiful , but that' s not where we' re moving .
that' s correct , but it is where we' re staying tonight ... ... under the stars and the moonlit sky .
i heard a realtor talk about it .

we came up the coast highway .
my wife says it' s twice as long , but it' s twice as pretty .
well , helensville' s pretty quiet , like most places around here .

just around the corner .
helensville county sheriff .
i need a sheriff , please .
he' s out on a personal matter .
can you tell me what it' s about ?
no .
when will he be back ?
can' t say .
would you like to leave a message ?
dr. leeds ?
how is she ?
she' s got a nasty concussion .
we' re doing a rape kit .
i' m sorry , i have to ask you this .
when was the last time you had sexual relations with your wife ?
it was about an hour before .
there' s no sign she was actually raped .
she' s lost some blood , but you already know that .
can i see her ?
there' s no treatment other than time .
right now she needs to rest .
any excitement at all could send her back into shock .
these are skin scrapings from under her nails .
i' m sending them to a lab in seattle .
i was a detective in seattle .
lf you put my name on it , i' il call ahead and speed things up .
okay .
yeah , that would be helpful .
thank you .
one more thing ....
that orderly ?
has been here all night .
that orderly ?
has been here all night .
your wife is in delayed shock .
i better phone the sheriff .
he' s here .
down in the basement , level one .
where are you going ?
this is off limits .
i need to talk to the sheriff .
sheriff' s busy .
go un busy him .
it' s an emergency .
yeah , what ?
i know who you are , detective .
how ?
your wife' s admitting form .
what can i do for you ?
can we talk ?
no .
we just talked .
please excuse me .
i have another matter .
all due respect , sir , but my wife was just attacked in your jurisdiction .
i wasn' t some flatfoot guarding a dairy queen .
i worked homicide six years in metro .
so i know you didn' t just say you have another matter .
homicide .
so what ?
what' s your point ?
i want in on this investigation .
look , my wife was practically beaten to death .
come on .
this will only take a second .
thanks for doing this , ed .
it' s not a problem , morgan .
he' s okay .
what have you got for me so far ?
it wasn' t a fair fight .
his hands are pretty clean , mostly defensive wounds .
from the lividity , i' d say he' s been dead about two hours .
eye socket' s fractured .
rectangular lacerations with jagged markings are imprinted on the cheekbone .
but not from , say , somebody' s ring .
see here ?
it looks to me like he' s been pistol
hey , not now .
see here ?
like , from underneath the grip of an automatic .
it' s gotta be 9 millimeter .
or beretta maybe , or it could be a glock .
cause ?
cerebral hematoma .
the back of his skull is cracked .
would you all give me a moment , please .
my god .
something wrong , detective ?
what ?
aside from my wife being attacked ?
for a second back there , i thought maybe you' d seen him someplace before .
listen , you can tell the sheriff .
you tell me on the way .
your wife shouldn' t be disturbed till morning .
i' il have you back by then .
i think i' m gonna stay here .
i need to talk to you .
you' re ....
you' re from seattle ?
yeah .
how' d you hear about the campsite ?
my wife heard it from a realtor .
we got the directions at a bar called the morningstar .
so someone could have heard you talking about going up there ?
well , we weren' t whispering .
and then you left her alone .
i went to the store .
i left my gun .
what kind of a gun ? . 38 , service issue revolver .
you only carried the one ?
yeah .
the thing is , detective ... ... we found this .
one shot fired .
yours ?
you found it at the campsite ?
no , we found it at the murder scene .
which means to me , the same man committed both crimes .
he could have taken it from the campsite where he attacked your wife ... ... and then lost it when he ....
that is my son in there .
someone ran him off the road and then murdered him .
i' m sorry about your son .
thank you .
sheriff ?
morgan .
what ?
my name .
morgan .
morgan .
you think these crimes are connected ?
two assaults , same night .
a few miles apart .
it' s a good bet , no ?
apparently ....
this wasn' t the weapon my son was pistol whipped with .
so do you have any leads ?
i have ideas .
sheriff ?
yeah .
go ahead , dave .
checked suspects with his priors : assault and battery , rape .
you were right .
we got a name .
i' m listening .
it' s that bookie , john drexel .
remember him , mac ?
read me his resume .
gambling conviction , time in lompoc .
two double a ' s and a double l this year alone .
bobby was into him for a bundle .
i settled that debt personally .
bobby must have went back .
where is he ?
his brother says he' s over at j. b. ' s .
did you get that , detective ?
two aggravated assaults ... ... another for lewd and lascivious .
who is he ?
he' s a creep .
where you going ?
wait in the car .
i said , wait in the car .
what did you do ?
i didn' t do nothing .
come here .
wanna tell me ?
tell me what you did .
wanna tell me ?
mckenna !
suspect resisted .
suspect died .
you want to tell me ?
tell me .
that' s it .
come on .
come on .
come on .
enough .
enough .
whatever you think he did , you need evidence to prove it .
where' s the bathroom ?
down the hall .
i need to get back .
be with my wife .
why don' t you let her rest ?
i' il get you back there in a couple hours .
you look like you could use some rest .
i' m not tired .
couch is yours if you change your mind .
i' m making coffee .
lf you want something harder , it' s in the cabinet .
i' il take some coffee .
all right .
take that shirt off .
what ?
take the shirt off .
why ?
it' s wet , full of blood .
i' il throw it in the machine .
that was bobby about 1 0 years ago .
so were you and your son close ?
no , not of late , anyway .
truth is we weren' t even speaking .
damn shame of that is that earlier tonight he left me a message ... ... on the answering machine .
that was ... ... the first time i heard his voice in a long time .
what did he say on the message ?
not much , really .
he sounded like he was in some kind of fix and he needed to talk .
probably about money .
i just was out in the field .
so , what did he do around here ?
worked for this jonah ganz .
he owned that bar you were in earlier tonight ... ... along with some other interests .
he' s got his greedy little fingers in a bunch of pies .
i have yet to be able to break one of them .
why would he work for a guy like that ?
paid well .
right .
yeah ?
okay .
drexel' s got an alibi , airtight .
you got something you want to say to me ?
no , sir .
i can' t imagine what you' re going through .
whoever did this to my wife ... ... l want justice too .
okay , then you help me get this son of a bitch .
i' il help you any way i can .
and when you catch him ?
what do you intend on doing ?
not miss .
you' re not serious .
this ain' t the city .
only god is watching .
we' re police officers .
we take an oath to uphold the law .
we don' t have to agree with it .
we just have to abide by it .
so if i gave you a chance to get even ... ... with the guy that attacked your wife , you wouldn' t take it ?
i don' t know what i' d do .
the hell you don' t .
everyone .
gentlemen .
this is detective pruitt .
he' s going to be assisting us .
show him the same respect you do me .
all right ?
let' s go back to work .
let' s go .
not one stone unturned , okay ?
not one damn stone .
can i have one of those ?
help yourself .
thanks .
daniel .
daniel .
you probably came down this road last night ... ... on the way to the hospital .
you happen to see anything ?
i' d have told you .
remember , we' re looking for any sign of a 9 mm .
you' il be here if i need you ?
yeah .
listen ... ... she may be the only real witness we have .
lf she' s up to it , see what she remembers .
so she can relive this whole nightmare in some damn trial ?
there won' t be any trial .
bobby struck down the power line ... ... probably causing an outage in the area .
so let' s start by getting the time frame .
have we ruled out robbery ?
that' s been bugging me , mac .
perp stole a . 38 from that campsite , but took nothing from bobby .
wallet and watch were still on him .
with bobby , it was personal .
what about this ?
why pistol whip with a . 9 when he' d lifted pruitt' s . 38 ?
i' m stuck on that too .
we got two sets of prints from the gun , not three .
they belong to the pruitts .
where' d you get pruitt' s ?
they' re on computer file .
his wife' s are from personal items .
maybe our man wiped his own prints off .
and left the other two intact ?
no , he definitely dropped ... ... that . 38 by accident at the struggle .
we got to get some prints .
where do we start ?
where do we start ?
why' d someone want him dead so bad they beat him to death ?
man has a gun on you , you' d do whatever he says ... ... even let him knock you around .
look .
it' s the middle of the night , middle of nowhere , no witnesses .
lf he wanted to kill him , he' d shoot him .
why take the time to beat him ?
that' s my point .
i mean , there' s lots of motives ... ... but this guy' s ....
this guy' s was rage .
make a list of the people that are least likely to mourn bobby' s passing .
and he also left me a message at about 1 0 : 00 .
find out where that came from .
what about this detective pruitt ?
what about him ?
we should check him out some more .
save it .
he' s a cop .
he' s going through the same thing i am .
dr. cody to the pharmacy .
dr. cody to the pharmacy , please .
dr. graham and dr. stephen to icu .
dr. graham and dr. stephen to icu .
it' s an emergency .
come on .
thanks , man .
sorry about that .
sure .
detective bureau .
biggs .
roy , it' s pru .
retired country man .
don' t tell me .
the boredom' s got to you already .
listen , partner , i need a favor .
and i need it really quick .
dr. leeds ?
you need to check with lab processing .
there' s an evidence bag coming to you .
my name' s on it .
evidence ?
why would your name be ?
i' m helping out a sheriff with a sexual assault case .
roy , the envelope has a blood swatch and some skin scrapings .
can you cross the samples and see if they' re from the same guy ?
sure i can .
danny , is everything okay ?
how' s jess ?
i' il fill you in later .
and don' t tell anyone else .
don' t talk to anyone else .
i' m on it .
i' il call back .
killer .
car .
it' s a killer .
why was your picture in his wallet ?
i was his girl for a while .
didn' t last long .
why not ?
he hardly ever touched me .
i broke it off .
was he angry about that ?
him ?
angry ?
he stole my car .
did you turn him in ?
no , his daddy found out and brought it back .
whole thing was sort of funny at first ... ... and after that , i hated him .
why' s that ?
he beat the living crap out of me .
he beat the living crap out of me .
it' s him .
it' s him !
morgan .
morgan , i need to talk to you .
not now .
there' s something i need to tell you .
i wanna show you something .
what is it ?
it' s another shot .
come on .
get something this time ?
yeah .
he was at the bar with some other men .
he was with bobby .
he and bobby work for ganz .
anyway , his name' s jay redmond sawyer .
you don' t remember talking to anybody besides the barmaid ?
there was a lot of people at the bar .
and you don' t remember seeing my son there ?
i can' t be sure .
well , maybe your wife will remember him .
what ?
forgot to pee ?
you' il need more evidence to link him to either crime .
he' s a registered sex offender .
he was with bobby .
someone saw him with a handgun .
what' s the matter with you ?
come on , detective .
you ride with me .
you must think you' re pretty smart .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
i guess you' d have to be , passing your detective exam so young and all .
the job wasn' t what you think .
sometimes you' re lucky to get home .
that' s the thing about luck .
it often runs out when you least expect it to .
think i could ever be a hotshot detective like you , mr. pruitt ?
i don' t really know .
yeah , you must be one smart cop .
i guess all those merit citations cancel out those justifiable homicides .
you checking up on me ?
have i done something to offend you , deputy forrest ?
may i call you david ?
no , you may not .
you listen to me , detective .
we don' t need outsiders telling us how to do our job .
we know how to do our job .
morgan asked me to help with this case directly or indirectly .
i don' t care what he told you .
i know you' re involved in all this , directly or indirectly .
guard the entrance .
the only other way out' s that back alley .
lf you have to shoot , don' t miss .
yes , sir .
mac , can i have a word ?
yeah , just a sec .
you might need this .
i took the liberty of having tustin reload it for you .
go upstairs , look around .
don' t do anything .
just wait for me .
what ?
but i might remind you no calls .
the young man has been paying off his casino markers with your money .
such men who find themselves in debt sometimes panic ... ... maybe threaten to make our arrangement together public .
and that , mr. ganz , can never happen .
yes .
well ....
a new man will be making the pickups , starting this weekend .
i don' t like being here .
don' t make me come back .
i said , no more calls .
i' m sorry , sir .
it' s the police .
a detective pruitt .
get a number .
he' s not calling , sir .
he' s here .
can i help you ?
i' m here to question one of your employees .
i assume you have a warrant .
red sawyer' s an ex convict .
we don' t need a warrant .
can you find red sawyer and ask him to come up here ?
mckenna .
i' m truly very sorry .
almost had a heart attack when i heard about bobby .
you need a heart for that .
this is hardly the time to allow bad blood to boil between us .
bobby was an important man in my business .
i' d given him a promotion .
he was like a son to me .
he was my son .
we both have the same interests here , sheriff .
to right a terrible wrong .
mr. pruitt , isn' t it ?
try one of my montecristos .
cubans .
just got them yesterday .
had a hell of a time getting them here , but worth the trouble .
no , thanks .
well , yes .
they are illegal .
you' re not here to arrest me , are you ?
cut the crap .
mckenna , why don' t you just get off me ?
i loved bobby .
you .
you stay out of my face .
boss , what' s up ?
we' ve got you on a parole violation .
come down to the station with us .
we need a chat .
gun !
stop it !
call an ambulance .
wanna tell me what you were doing back there ?
no .
you tried to kill him .
you almost killed me .
don' t impede my investigation .
this is your own personal manhunt .
listen , son .
you got enough problems .
you want another one right now ?
the thing is , forrest was shot with a 9 mm .
you tell me ... ... why this guy would run if he wasn' t guilty .
why ?
where' s red now ?
they' re sewing him up .
he' s guarded .
he' il spend the night here .
look , i wanna interrogate him .
so do l .
you can' t beat the truth out of him .
ls that right ?
you want the truth ?
you know exactly what i want .
yeah .
you made that pretty clear .
tomorrow , first thing , we' il go by the crime scene ... ... find the evidence we need to clean this up .
i want you there .
you got a place to stay tonight ?
i' il be right here .
sorry .
she making any progress ?
no .
she' s still pretty out of it .
when she' s more alert , i' d like to show her red' s mug shot .
doc says that' s too risky .
this is not a request .
she' s got to be questioned .
don' t you mean interviewed ?
she' s a victim , not a suspect .
you listen .
your wife was attacked .
that' s a damn tragedy ... ... but she is still alive .
doc , we' re leaving in the morning .
sheriff mckenna says she' s a material witness in two felony crimes .
now , i had to sedate her again .
i think he aims on hearing what she has to say .
there' s something else .
we couldn' t save the baby .
no , that' s a mistake .
she' s not pregnant .
actually , she was .
about five weeks .
i' m sorry .
jess .
i' m here .
jess .
i' m sorry .
no .
i' m sorry .
i' m so sorry .
i shouldn' t have left you .
everything' s gonna be okay .
morning .
morning .
we' il leave in the morning .
dog .
dog .
knife .
morning .
morning .
jess , who did this to you ?
morning .
what happened to that machine ?
it' s on its way to the junkyard .
skin scrapings and blood from that shirt are the same type , b negative .
but that don' t mean squat .
they' il have to wait for the dna .
they did find something odd in that blood on the guy' s t shirt .
what is it ?
it' s full of anabolic steroids .
one major side effect , no lead in his pencil .
know what i mean ?
guy like that probably wouldn' t try to rape anybody .
danny , you still there ?
yeah .
i' m still here .
your sheriff pal sent a blood sample to be matched a couple of hours ago .
name on it was redmond sawyer .
this mckenna was asking questions .
what did he want to know ?
spoke to the cap about your service record .
you want to tell me what' s going on ?
roy .
i don' t want to get you in the middle of it .
i' il call you back .
sheriff ?
what ?
we got a bullet casing .
it' s a 9 millimeter .
can i see that ?
lf that matches red' s gun , i' d say that' s all i need .
you have the ability to check that out here ?
do we have the ability ?
yes , we damn sure do .
yes we do .
come on , let' s put an end to this .
so , smitty ...
so , smitty ...
... red' s guilty , right ?
yes , sir .
he shot david , sir .
i mean , my kid .
lf he did , not with the gun he had .
ed compared the grip of his beretta with the marks on bobby .
they don' t match .
what about the bullet casing ?
the case you brought in wasn' t fired from red' s gun .
wait for the blood to match .
sir ?
yeah .
bobby' s truck caused a power outage on the highway .
the lights went out about 1 1 .
1 1 ?
right .
wayne' s got those impressions .
he' s getting a size and type for the suspect' s tire .
he says he' s close .
well , where is he ?
outside , dropping off red' s pickup .
weren' t those impressions smudged ?
we got a pretty good one .
ls that forrest' s desk ?
yeah .
he wanted me to find some evidence bag and get it to mckenna .
excuse me .
you looking for something ?
these were the first photos taken ?
yeah .
who was on the scene first ?
i was .
look . ln all these photos , the doors to the trailer are open .
yeah , that' s right .
they were open when i got there .
so ?
ls there a way they can be unlocked from the inside ?
no .
not unless they were busted open .
were they ?
did you examine the bolt ?
what' s this got to do with it ?
i locked and latched the doors before i had it towed .
i didn' t see any evidence to suggest that bolt had been broken .

and you were making bobby pay to keep quiet .
how could you know that ?
you just told me .
well , so what ?
i knew jonah would find out sooner or later .
he couldn' t have bobby telling his dad about the poison on the reservation .
he figured he might blackmail him if he didn' t back off about the money .
but bobby never would have talked .
he left a message at his dad' s .
what did he say ?
i don' t know .

thanks .
glad to see someone who can appreciate the finer things .
billy , if you' re not gonna trade jabs ... ... then get out of the damn ring !
bobby enjoy the finer things ?
bobby' s taste in tobacco ran closer to camels than cubans .
something he learned from his father .
so he never smoked one ?
i would say not .
well , i found one in bobby' s rig .
it was a montecristo .
one of yours ?
attaboy , billy .
go after him .
go after him .
bobby was using one of my company trucks .
i could have left that there .
i considered that .
but you said these cubans came the day bobby was killed .
you did say that , right ?
meaning ?
lf you just got them , how could they be in bobby' s rig before that night ?
ls this going somewhere , detective ?
yeah , it is .
and so are you .
mr. ganz .
mr. ganz , i did it .
deputy , i want to press full charges against this man .
harassment , police brutality , assault .

called a citizen' s arrest .
you picked a pretty prominent citizen .
what' s the charge ?
murder .
and who did he supposedly kill ?
bobby mckenna .
i see .
and how do you know that ?
his prints will match those on a cigar band i found in bobby' s truck .
he isn' t even a police officer .
how can you trust any evidence he may have planted in my truck ?
sorry . lf mr. pruitt has something to say about this , mckenna will listen .
i found this in a panel underneath the seat of bobby' s truck .
ganz killed bobby for stealing .
tell mckenna .
maybe you better tell him .
what is this ?
the nail in his coffin .
i don' t understand why we' re in a hurry .
that would take too long to explain .
sometimes it' s better if you don' t have to tell me everything ?
you' re just gonna have to trust me .
are you okay ?
yeah .
all right .
ready ?
yeah .
where are you going ?
we' re leaving .
thank you for your concern .

brought ganz in late last night .
claimed he killed bobby over some money bobby was stealing .
a lot of cash .
his lawyer drops by like clockwork .
where did pruitt come up with this ?
that cigar band was in bobby' s truck .
claims ganz' s prints are on it .
i checked .
there is a thumbprint .
mean anything to you ?
yeah .
it' s cuban .
ganz just got them .
you searched that truck .
how did you miss all this cash ?
he claimed it was in a panel under the seat .
look , mac , something else .
what ?
after pruitt left , wayne came by here .
had these with him .
claims the impressions we found ... ... match the whitestone tires on pruitt' s car .
exact same tire type .
i talked to david .
he found a section of whitestone tire at the murder scene .
i looked through his desk and couldn' t find it .
morgan , you said yourself he had a blowout recently .
pruitt could have taken evidence .
what are you saying ?
wayne also brought over a 9 mm automatic .
a glock .
he found it in a washing machine at the junkyard .
so ?
those machines were just taken there .
pruitt' s prints are on the 9 .
i called his captain .
all metro detectives are issued a . 38 .
yes , i know that .
well , his primary was a 9 glock .
yeah .
well ?
the shell casing was fired from the 9 wayne brought .
all right .
call the hospital .
get somebody to his wife' s room .
doc leeds said he took her and left .
why not tell me that tomorrow ?
danny , can you slow down ?
jess ... ... you were attacked .
you pointed a man out and said he was the one .
he wasn' t .
now that man' s dead .
i didn' t do it .
the best thing for us to do is get out of here .
danny .
danny , he had tattoos .
he had tattoos .
the dog and the knife ?
you were describing those tattoos .
there was another man .
he just stood there and he watched it happen .
i understand now .
you know who did this ?
yeah .
i know who did this .
you can' t just let him go free .
this is your career , mckenna .
you think about that .
lf what pruitt says holds water , it' s your life .
you think about that .

everyone stay clear .
i' il handle this on my own .

i didn' t kill your son .
you' re a liar .
he went to steal my car .
when the car wasn' t there , wayne changed the plan .
i didn' t kill your son .
look , morgan .
i found this varsity pin from his jacket .
he left it there .
that' s why he left you the message .
he had to tell someone .
dad ?
i' m sorry .
i was on that road looking for a hospital ... ... and we almost collided .
jess thought he was the guy .
i jumped him and put him in the locked trailer .
when your deputies arrived , the doors were open .
you' ve seen the photos .
look , i left your son alone .
he was alive .
it was ganz .
he was in front of the cab the whole time .
he went back there and he finished him .
that' s why the cigar band was in there .
you lied to me .
you gotta believe me .
you gotta believe me , morgan .
it was ganz .
bobby had things on him that would bury him forever .
look at him .
he knows .
he' s not going anywhere .
it was pruitt !
damn you , mckenna .
ask his wife .
go on , ask her .
she was there .
she saw everything !
how the hell would you know that ?
your boy was a thief , mckenna .
turn around .
the both of you turn around .
turn around .
what are you gonna do ?
shoot me ?
a dozen people know you brought me here .
yeah .
you' re right .
i can' t shoot you .
morgan .
i' m sorry .
lf there' s anything i can do ....
i feel a little better .
how about yourself ?
withholding evidence , impeding on a criminal investigation ... ... aggravated assault .
i' il clean that all up .
why don' t you take your beautiful wife and get the hell out of here ?
lf you ever come back , come by and talk to me .
