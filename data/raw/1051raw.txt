and he wants to see you hanged !
we" re in a lot of trouble .
what are you , crazy ?

robin of loxley ?
robin of loxley .
let me see .
raven" s egg .
blood of a hen .
little bit more blood , yes .
eyeballs of a crocodile .
testicles of a newt .

robin of loxley is handsome and brave .
he seeks to regain his family" s honour .
the little sod could be trouble .
are you certain ?
certain ?
you want certain , hire a witch .
l" m just your cook .
here .
eat this .
lt" s fabulous .
looks like a seder at vincent price" s house .
such an unusual name , latrine .
how did your family come by it ?
we changed it in the ninth century .
you mean you changed it to latrine ?
yeah , it used to be shithouse .
lt" s a good change .
lt" s a good change .
now , what about this robin fellow ?
how can i stop him ?
maybe ... ... l could devise a magic potion .
one that would make him unable to perform the slightest task .
but in return ... ... you must help me .
what are you , kidding ?
name it .
anything you want .
put in a good word for me with the sheriff of rottingham .
l" ve got the hots for him .
i keep a likeness of him in my boudoir .
rotty .
rotty , rotty , rotty .
l" m amazed to think that a handsome blade like the sheriff of rottingham ... ... would ever want a creature like you .
well , if you" re going to puncture my dreams ... ... you can forget my promise to help you !
no , wait !
wait , wait , wait !
maybe if we got him drunk .
very drunk .
you got a shot .
oh , good .
dismount .
wait here .
l" il go make sure it" s safe .
i say , would you mind awfully getting out of the way ?
i say , not until you pay the toll .
toll ?
what toll ?
well , the toll you pay for crossing me bridge .
l" m not paying any toll .
this bridge is on my family" s land .
well , it used to be my family" s land .
you" re robin of loxley !
and whom might you be ?
they call me little john .
but don" t let my name fool you .
ln real life ... ... l" m very big .
l" il take your word for it .
now , let me pass .
sorry .
but a toll is a toll ... ... and a roll is a roll .
and if we don" t get no tolls , then we don" t eat no rolls .
i made that up .
lt" s very fascinating , but l" m afraid l" m going to have to hurt you .
my pleasure .

you go too far .
l" ve only just begun .
l" m warning you , if you don" t stop levying these taxes ... ... l" il lead the people in a revolt against you .
and why should the people listen to you ?
because unlike some other robin hoods ... ... l can speak with an english accent .
to tell you the truth , this guy" s starting to get on my nerves !
worry not , your highness .
i shall dispose of this feathered upstart .
i challenge you to a duel .
i accept .
that" s going to cost you , loxley !

yeah , l" il try .
lt" s been a wonderful party , and we" d love to stay and all that ... ... but l" m afraid we really must dash .
so ta ta !
i sent word that each village should send the very best men they have .
these are them .
we" re in a lot of trouble .
good people , who have travelled from villages near and far ... ... lend me your ears .
that" s disgusting .
hear me !
men like prince john and rottingham must be stopped !
stopped from taxing us into poverty !
stopped from taking what is ours !
lf we stand up to them all together as one , we can win the day !
we shall go on to the end .
we shall not flag or fail .
we shall fight on the seas and oceans .
we shall defend our isle , whatever the cost may be .
we shall never surrender .
then they shall say of us : " never have so many owed so much to so few .
that was beautiful .
what" s going on ?
they" re asleep .
hey , man .

why don" t you let me give it a try ?
look at yourselves .

and i say we fight back !
are you with me ?
yea or nay ?
which one means yes ?

your majesty ... ... stop me if l" m wrong about this , but wasn" t your mole ... ... on the other side ?
i have a mole ?
what is it ?
lt" s what we" ve named a stealth catapult .
we" ve been working on it secretly for months .
it can hurl one of these heavy boulders undetected ... ... over 1 00 yards , completely destroying anything it hits .
how does it work ?
lt" s quite simple .
take a heavy rock .
put it where l" m sitting .
then pull that lever .
you mean like this ?
oh , dear lord ... ... if you see fit to send me my one true love
thank you !
oh , my god !
oh , my god , you" re here !

you" re fahsnickered !
you drunken mule , you .
whoa , morris !
whoa !

you" ve just entered the territory of robin hood and his merry men .
feygeles ?
we" re straight , just merry .
and who might you be with the long feather in your hat ?
i am robin of loxley .
robin of loxley ?
l" ve just come from maid marian , the lady whose heart you stole .
you prince of thieves , you .
i knew her parents before they were taken in the plague ... ... lord and lady bagelle .
you and maid marian were meant for each other .
what a combination !
loxley and bagelle .
can" t miss .
and who are you , sir ?
i am rabbi tuckman ... ... purveyor of sacramental wine ... ... and mohel extraordinaire .
hello , rabbi .
hello , boys .
mohel ? l" ve never heard of that profession .
mohel , he" s a very important guy .
he makes circumcisions .
what , pray tell , sir , is a circumcision ?
lt" s the latest rage .
the ladies love it .
i want one .
l" il take two .
i get one !
l" m game .
how" s it done ?

i put it into this little hole here ... ... and nip the tip .
who" s first ?
i changed me mind .
i forgot , i already got one .
question
i gotta work with a much younger crowd .
rabbi , you seem to be on the side of good .
will you join us and share your wisdom ... ... your counsel and perhaps ... ... some of your wine ?
well , wisdom and counsel , that" s easy .
but this is sacramental wine .
lt" s only used to bless things .
wait a minute !
there" s things here .
there" s trees , there" s rocks ... ... there" s birds , there" s squirrels .
come on !
we" il bless them all until we get fahsnickered !
join me !
let" s hear it for the rabbi !
good evening , don giovanni .
it was very good of you to come at such short notice .
and all the way from jersey .
well , it is quite a drive .
but you do realize that prince john commanded this to be a secret meeting ?
i mean , who are these men ?
these are my trusted associates .
on my right , dirty ezio .
on my left ... ... filthy luca .
now ... ... we thank you for inviting us on the day of your daughter" s wedding .
i hope her first child is a masculine child .
shut up .
we didn" t have our meeting yet .
all right ... ... l understand you" ve been bothered by this fruit , robin hood .
and you want robin rubbed out ... ... eliminated , maybe even killed .
yes , you put it succinctly .
suck what ?
succinctly .
it means " perfectly .
oh , yeah .
i knew that .
excuse me , don giovanni ... ... your lizard seems limp .
at my age , you know , sometimes ....
oh , my lizard !
he" s just sleeping , that" s all .
charlie .
charlie !
i could have been somebody .
i could have been a contender .
you know , charlie" s got bad breath .
he got excited , you know .
come on .
normally , i would be so happy to be of service to you ... ... but there is something that weighs heavily on my heart .
ln the years that we" ve been friends , england and jersey ... ... never once have you invited me to your home for coffee and cake .
or ganool .
something , you know ?
a g what ?
a ganool .
lt" s a pastry with stuffing .
and it" s got sprinkles on it .
excuse me .
i don" t understand a word you" re saying .
i just got back from the dentist ... ... and they left in the cotton .
i will take these cotton balls from you with my hand ... ... and put them in my pocket .
whatever .
your other associate says little .
he says nothing .
why is that ?
because my enemy cut out his tongue .
good grief !
why ?
because he went like this .
and he didn" t like it , so he cut out his tongue .
come over here .
go like this .
he can" t do it !
i love to tease him .
tell me , don giovanni .
that" s me .
what ?
what will you do about robin hood ?
listen , l" ve got an idea .
tomorrow , you" re going to have your medieval fun and games .
the most important event will be the archery contest .
robin won" t be able to resist .
why" s that ?
we" il make him an offer he can" t refuse .
i was just gonna say that .
that" s brilliant !

::: you !
oh , my dearest , l" m ready for that kiss now .
but first , i must warn you ... ... it could only be a kiss .
for i am a virgin ... ... and could never ... ... go all the way .
unless , of course , i were married .
or if a man pledged his endless love ... ... to me .
or if i knew that he desperately cared for me .
or if he were really cute .
but my darling , you" re shivering .
are you cold ?
what are you wearing underneath that cape ?
practically nothing .
oh , except that .
i forgot to tell you about my chastity belt . lt" s an everlast .
l" il bet .
one day , he who is destined for me ... ... shall be endowed with the magical key ... ... that will bring an end to my ... ... virginity .
oh , marian ... ... if only t" were me .
oh , if it t" were you , t" would be ... ... t" werrific .
no ding ding without the wedding ring .
goodbye , my dearest .
toodle loo !

they just don" t match my purse .
blinkin , fix your boobs .
you look like a bleeding picasso .
goodness gracious !
peanuts !

poor man" s lunch there !
shell game here !
the royal archery contest is about to begin !
archers , take your places !
are we ... ... prepared ?
sire .
oh , it" s good .
lt" s good .
archers ... ... to the line !
ready ... ... aim ... ... wait for it ... ... fire !
the two archers that hit the bull" s eye can stay !
the rest of you gentlemen ... ... can bugger off !
there he is !
the old man is loxley !
are you sure ?
it looks like mark twain .
the old man may go first !
well done ... ... robin of loxley !
he" s crazy !
we gotta stop him !
sorry , ladies , this is the royal entrance .
you" il have to go around the other way .
look what you" ve done , you idiot !
now he" s even more of a hero to the people .
luca pazzo still has a shot .
but he hit the very centre of the bull" s eye !
schmuck !
wait and watch , sire .
he split robin" s arrow in twain !
things are looking up .
nice shot !
robin" s in trouble !
shove off !
i lost .
i lost ?
l" m not supposed to lose .
let me see the script .
robin , time to fly .
go back to sherwood forest !
oh , good .
they" ve opened the salad bar .
wait !
i get another shot !
he gets another shot !
does robin get another shot ?
yes , he does .
he does .
sires and ladies , silence !
listen !
robin has another shot .
let" s give him the chop .
quick !
eliminate him before he shoots !
how did you do that ?
i heard that coming a mile away .
very good , blinkin .
well done .
pardon ?
who" s talking ? " patriot arrow " ?
arrest him !
move it !
move it !
out of the way !
loxley is a traitor to the crown !
lt" il be so much fun to watch you hang !
wait !

lf you let robin live , l" il do the most disgusting thing i can think of .
and what" s that ?
i shall marry you .
what ?
you" il be mine ?
you" il give yourself to me every night ?
and sometimes right after lunch ?
yes .
but only my body .
you can never have my heart , my mind , or my soul .
oh , yes .
i respect that .
marian , my life" s not worth it !
just say nay !
walk this way .
send word to one and all and all and one
that" s redundant , isn" t it ?
what ?
shut up !
tell everybody that before the day is out , we shall have a wedding ... ... or a hanging .
either way , we ought to have a lot of fun .
we are grossly outnumbered .
so what can we do ?
we gotta get the villagers .
they" re not ready to fight .
man , we are choiceless !
what" s the fastest way to reach the villagers ?
why don" t we fox them ?
fox them .
fox them .
fox them !
take this message to the village as fast as you can .
now pay attention .
