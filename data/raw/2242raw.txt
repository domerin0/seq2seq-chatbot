no , not for a while .
no prospects , huh ?
no .
i' ve been busy working pretty much .
i leave here and i only got so much time before i have to go to the other job , so ...
it' s about like the rest of us , i' m telling you .
plus i gotta work nights , so if i want to go out at night ,
i can' t do that , unless i have a day off , so
i' m ready for the beaches .
yeah ?
yeah .
i want to go to aruba .
oh , yeah ?
i saw that on tv the other day .
the beaches are great .
i think i' m about done .

good night .
good night .
you ready for your first day ?
oh , yeah .
not nervous or anything ?
no .
i' m fine .
okay , that' s great .
so tell me again , do you have airbrush experience ?
yeah .
i used to airbrush t shirts at the mall .
great .
when you were doing that , were you working with other airbrushers , or were you just waiting on the customers ?
no .
i just worked by myself .
they would bring me what i needed , bring me the orders , and i would take care of it .
okay , well , that' s really good .
we' il see what happens .
good morning , everybody .
i know you guys are all aware of the big order that we' ve got in , and we' ve been working hard to get it done , but we feel like you guys need some help .
and so here she is .
her name is rose .
we were very fortunate to find rose in the fact that she has airbrush experience .
she' s worked with stencils before , so she' il be working in the head painting area .
i' m sure she' il have questions throughout the day , so please help her .
i found rose , when we were interviewing her , to be very sweet and the consummate team player , so i think she' il fit in really well with our workforce here .
so i' il let you guys introduce her through the course of the day , and , um , please help her out with anything that she needs .
get to work .
you know you got to double glue those before you put ' em in the box , right ?
yes , i' m aware of that .
so do either of you smoke ?
i don' t .
yeah , i smoke .
do you ?
mm hmm .
well , when you' re done , if you want to , we can go grab a cigarette .
sure .
okay .
where did you used to work ?
i used to work at a nursing home .
and what' d you do there ?
i was a professional ass wiper .
you know , the bottom , the cna .
the one that everybody comes to when something dirty needs done is basically what i did .
i took care of people , the people who can' t do for themselves anymore , you have to do everything that they can' t do : shower them , dress them , feed them .
just depends on who you have , what you have to do .
it' s a hard job that you really , really have to be dedicated to .
you really have to like what you' re doing or you just can' t .
' cause there' s , like , days you go in there and it' s just
you just want to turn around and walk out , it' s that bad .
this isn' t as hard of work , but ...
i don' t think i' m gonna like this much better .
and what about you ?
what was the question ?
where did you work before you came here ?
i used to work maintenance in an old factory .
that' s cool .
mmm .
i' m very ready to get out of this area .
why is that ?
' cause there' s nothing here .
mm hmm .
i' m living in this little apartment with my daughter .
she' s two .
you can' t make money in this area .
it' s just poor .
everything' s poor .
are you married ?
no , i' m not married .
i thought i would be , but things don' t always work out like you think they' re going to .
you know .
just another bad decision .
yeah .
what are you doing right after work today ?
well , i probably have to ... get home and see my dad .
do you think you might be able to give me a ride ?
i don' t see why not .
i have another job that i have to be at like right after , but it' s not that far from here .
okay .
i' d really appreciate it .
no problem .
are you about done ?
yeah , think so .
i guess we' re gonna go have a cigarette , and we' il see you back up there in a little bit .
okay .
ready ?
rose ?
where are you ?
i' m in the bathroom .
oh , my god , rose !
what are you doing ?
i' m taking a bath .
do you do this all the time ?
no , not all the time .
remember when i told you i worked in a nursing home ?
i sure did .
i got hit in the back with a tray table by this little old man .
and it messed up my back .
i couldn' t pick jesse up for like a month .
but every once in a while my muscles will contract , and i get really sore .
and this feels really good .
and my apartment has no bathtub .
it just has a shower , so i take advantage .
but i clean it when i' m done .
i clean after i bathe .
okay .
i was kind of wondering .
i didn' t know what would happen if we' d get caught .
no .
she won' t be here for a long time .
oh , my gosh !
i mean , every room was the size of my whole living room .
the bedrooms
you could fit my whole house in two rooms in that house .
i could not believe it .
gorgeous !
chandeliers coming down out of the ceiling .
it was unreal .
hmm .
i mean , just fabulous , fabulous , fabulous .
and then ... you are not gonna believe this .
she tells me how particular this lady is .
and then she invites me inside of this house that she' s cleaning .
guess what .
she was in the jacuzzi bathtub
i am not kidding taking a bath .
she was supposed to be cleaning it ?
yes !
got sidetracked .
i' m not kidding .
i couldn' t believe it .
i thought i was gonna die .
all i could think about was that lady coming home and catching
you know , here i am , not supposed to be there , in there checking her house out , and there' s rose in the tub .
and you know , i thought , " wow .
yeah , i' d be afraid of ' em just coming home too early .
i' m not too sure about her .
yeah ?
what do you think ?
i don' t know .
she seems fine to me .
you think so ?
yeah .
she scares me a little .
hmm .
i was working at a restaurant , and they work day and night .
turn two different shifts .
i just didn' t have anybody to care for him .
it was really rough , and i didn' t want to have to put him in a nursing home .
the expense for that is huge .
yeah , those places
and you don' t want to do that unless you absolutely have to .
oh , really ?
yeah .
because a lot of times they' re understaffed or they don' t have all the equipment that they need .
you know , you get people in there that shouldn' t be there , that should be in other facilities , that are violent .
you know , you just , you never know what you' re gonna get .
you don' t know who they' re gonna put in the room with ' em .
you know , because it' s not ...
the way that they put people together is not necessarily by what their sickness may be ,
like , you know , put two stroke patients in the same room .
some people might be bedridden , and some people might be up walking around .
and they get into each other' s things and tear stuff up .
oh , wow .
yeah .
glad i didn' t do that .
no .
and as far as , like , management , they' re so tight that what they' il do is take
you know , you might clock out , but if they see you walking across the parking lot , they' il be like , " can you come just for a minute and come help with this or that ?
and you end up staying over an hour or better .
and that happens three or four days a week .
so you don' t even get paid .
but you need your job , so what do you say ?
yeah .
you' re kind of st
you don' t want to make anybody mad , you know .
and they do it to everybody .
oh , really ?
so everybody kind of just did it , you know ?
wow .
i can' t imagine them doing that here .
we' re gonna make quota and get some of that bonus .
did you guys hear about that ?
no , i haven' t heard anything .
yeah , we' re gonna get probably about $50 if we meet quota at the end of the week .
i thought that was great .
that' s awfully nice of ' em .
yeah , that' il help me out a lot with bills and things .
that' s what you' d spend it on if you got it ?
i probably will just
i don' t know .
i haven' t really thought about it .
what do you think you' il spend yours on ?
i don' t know .
if the weather keeps getting nice ,
i' il get camping equipment or something like that .
oh , that sounds like fun .
mm hmm .
well , if you' re looking to make a little bit of extra money ,
i was wanting to go out this weekend .
if you want to baby sit jesse for a few hours ,
i couldn' t pay a whole lot , but i could give you a little bit .
what night ?
friday night .
if that would work out for you .
sure .
i think i could do that for you .
could you ?
yeah .
she' s really good .
how old is she ?
she' s two .
okay .
it' il be nice for her too , ' cause it' il give her somebody else to be around .
she doesn' t she' s not around too many other people .
what' s she like to do ?
she likes to color and she likes to read books .
okay .
yeah , and she goes to bed at 8 : 00 , so more than likely
that' s great , ' cause that way i can sew after
oh , yeah .
that' s good , that' s good .
okay , no problem .
great .
i' m excited now .
are you about done ?
yeah , pretty much .
wanna have a smoke ?
sure .
now , you know i probably won' t be home till about 11 : 00 , and i left a number hanging on the refrigerator if you need me .
i was wondering if you left me a number .
yeah , i sure did .
if i need to get ahold of you .
yes , i did .
so she should be going to bed in about a half an hour , usually about 8 : 00 .
about 15 minutes before you put her to bed , just give her a few goldfish crackers and some juice , just enough to put something in her stomach .
but she should be all right .
she may cry whenever i leave .
just kind of expect it .
okay .
all you have to do is lay her down and just read her a book , and she' il get her blanket , suck her thumb and she' il be done .
all right .
that sounds great .
she' s pretty easy .
hey , sweetie , what do you have there ?
who' s here ?
who' s here ?
watch out .
hey , come in .
hey , come in .
hello .
come here , sweetie .

yes , you will .
i want my baby !
okay , you get your baby .
i guess we' re gonna go and  okay .
what' s that ?
it' s another baby .
you can take that baby and go night night with it .
love you .
mama , i wanna go with you .
no .
you' re gonna stay here with martha .
yeah .
you' re gonna have fun .
come here , sweetie .
no !
we' il read a story .
would you like to read a story ?
no !
i see a really nice book .
look !
she' s got a book . and she' s gonna read to you .
no !
i' il be back in a little bit .
here , give me a kiss .
no !
i want to go that way !
you might want to get her now .
i go that way !
come here , sweetie .
no !
do you want to play with some toys ?
no !
well , come on .
no !
oh , sweetie .
yeah , but seriously , it seems like every time i think i' m saving a little bit , getting a little bit ahead , something comes up .
jesse gets sick .
yeah .
have you been able to save much ?
a little bit .
i don' t have a checking account or anything , but ...
i got drawer change i' ve been saving .
drawer change , huh ?
yeah .
yeah , he' s got his own place , and then jesse and i live together .
yeah , he wasn' t ready for our baby .
he' s an artist , and he' s very into his work and what' s going on with him .
he doesn' t have time , you know , for anybody else .
but he helps out with her .
he baby sits while i work sometimes , if he has time , or whatever .
that' s good .
at least he sticks around a little bit and sees her .
yeah .
he makes an effort .
so did you finish high school ?
no .
actually , i had anxiety , and i ended up quitting .
what is that ?
oh , just when i got around a lot of people , you know ,
i' d get a little bit nervous and sometimes i' d have a panic attack .
really ?
yeah .
it was pretty bad , enough to quit .
did you go to a doctor or anything for that ?
um ...
yeah , i did at one point , but they just kept prescribing me pills that didn' t work , so i eventually just quit going and dealt with it myself , you know ?
there' s not much you can do about it , so
are you taking anything right now ?
no .
no ?
and how do you do ?
does that bother you anymore ?
it' s not as bad now , you know .
usually , the places i go , there' s not 400 people like school .
yeah .
it' s usually when there' s a lot of people .
lately , it' s only temporary when it' s bad .
mm hmm .
did you finish high school ?
no , i didn' t finish .
what happened there ?
i got rebellious in high school .
oh , yeah ?
oh , yeah .
yeah , i ran away , hitchhiked to charleston .

hello , sergeant .
detective taylor .
sgt. davis .
what do we got ?
we got a phone call at 6 : 45 from a neighbor stating that a child had been crying all night long .
she couldn' t get anybody to answer the door , so she called 911 .
we responded , made entry .
once inside , we found a 23 year old female on the living room floor by the name of rose hilliard .
okay .
any sign of forced entry ?
no sign .
any sign of robbery ?
doesn' t appear to be .
what about a struggle ?
appears to be a struggle , yes .
let' s go and take a look .
okay .
dad , i' ve got your breakfast .
well , how nice of you .
what are we having , cereal this morning ?
yeah .
cereal and some juice .
well , you' re right , sarge .
there' s no sign of forced entry into the apartment .
doesn' t look like a robbery .
her valuables and her purse are still here .
she' s got bruising to the neck , which is consistent with manual strangulation .
she' s got petechiae hemorrhage of the eyes .
where' s the baby ?
baby' s with the grandmother .
so the baby' s safe ?
yes .
ross , when you' re doing the fingerprints ,
i want you to process the bruising on her neck for prints .
okay , sir .
what did we find out from the neighborhood canvass ?
officer smeeks ?
you wanna fill the detective in on what you know ?
okay .
now , i spoke to three of the neighbors .
hey , mom , you didn' t happen to pick up any money in my room , did you ?
no , i didn' t .
i haven' t been in your room .
didn' t see in your room .
all right .
maybe you spent more than you thought you did .
i had a little bit saved up , so i might have misplaced it or something .
i was checking if you were in there and picked it up .
no , haven' t been in there .
haven' t seen it .
was it a lot of money ?
no , just a little i had saved up for an emergency .
this is a ring that my mother had given me .
when i turned 30 , she said i' d be responsible enough to take care of it .
okay , so it' s pretty sentimental , huh ?
yeah , it is , and this is my grandmother' s broach , and that was handed down through the family , and my mother thought she had gotten that , but i got it .
you' il never guess where this came from .
where' s that ?
i found this in the park with a metal detector .
oh , wow .
nice find .
i thought that was pretty good .
jake ?
i' m det .
taylor from the police department .
i need to talk to you for a minute .
can i come in ?
uh , is it necessary ?
it' s kind of important .
it' s about rose hilliard .
i need to talk to you about her .
all right , man .
come on in .
right through this door .
did you do this on the walls ?
yeah , yeah , most of it .
very interesting .
some would say .
how long have you known rose ?
oh , man , i' ve known her for a while , like ...
we were together for at least a year and a half .
probably altogether , i guess five years , somewhere around there .
okay .
i guess you share a child together ?
yeah .
what' s your daughter' s name ?
jesse .
okay .
so when was the last time you saw rose ?
oh , man .
uh ....

saturday .
uh , just last night .
so it was last night you were over there ?
yeah , yeah , friday night .
do you remember about what time that was ?
like 11 something .
it was later , man , like she was coming from a date .
why did you go over there ?
because , man , she' s ignorant , and she stole money of mine .
did you get to talk to her ?
yeah , i talked to her .
was there anybody else there at the house when you were there ?
uh , i remember she had some chick on the couch .
do you know who that person was ?
no , not a clue .
okay .
what did she look like ?
uh , looked like a person on a couch , man .
i don' t know .
so you didn' t pay much attention to her ?
no , man .
okay .
did you confront rose about her taking money from you ?
hell yeah .
did you get into an argument ?
uh ...
i don' t know .

you have got to be kidding me .
yeah .
he just came in today and told us .
he asked me a bunch of questions .
and this happened last night .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah , they were asking me because they thought i was the last one that seen her .
then i told him you were  well , you brought her home when i was there .
yeah .
you are not gonna believe this .
when i was there last night after you dropped her off , this guy started beating on the door , and she goes to the door and she opens it up , and he comes in .
he came in screaming and yelling .
she was okay when you left .
i mean , she was by herself .
she was fine , yeah .
when i left , she was fine .
but if he was waiting out there when you dropped her off , he was probably waiting on me to leave .
yeah .
and he went back in there .
oh , my god .
i can' t even imagine .
i know .
it happened too fast .
i know .
well , i got these for you .
oh , well , thank you .
thank you , martha .
you' re quite welcome .
yeah , definitely , you have to call this detective too .
oh , i will .
you' il have to give me the number .
hi .
how you doin ' ?
hello , martha .
i' m det .
taylor from the police department .
i need to talk to you about rose hilliard .
can i come in ?
oh , sure .
come on in .
i heard from kyle today , and he was telling me that something horrible had happened to rose , that she' d been murdered .
can i come in and have a seat ?
sure .
this is my father .
sir , i' m from the police department .
i was just here to talk to your daughter .
pleased to meet you .
pleased to meet you , sir .
i mean , at first i thought she was a really sweet girl .
and then the longer you get to know her , the pushier she gets and the more favors she asks for .
i mean , it was just one favor right after the other one .
did you feel like she took advantage of you ?
a little bit , yeah .
did she do that to other people ?
i' m not really sure .
it seemed like she picked on me a lot .
she didn' t really buddy up with the other employees .
she' d only been there a week .
well , in talking with the witnesses in the area , they indicate that you were the last one that was seen leaving the residence .
well , i i know that
well , i i don' t know .
i probably was .
i left after he did .
and that fact that , as far as the investigation is concerned , you were the last one that we know that saw her alive .
okay .
at some point , i would like to get fingerprints from you to be able to compare to evidence that we collected at the scene .
well , you know my fingerprints are gonna be there .
i was there .
right , but there' s other evidence that we have
that would only be the killer' s .
okay .
would you be willing to come to the police department tonight and give me a set of fingerprints ?
okay .
i would have to get someone to take care of my dad .
and about how long will that take ?
shouldn' t take more than 15 , 20 minutes
to get the fingerprints .
okay .
if you' d be able to do it tonight , it' d really help with the investigation .
i' il do anything i can to help .
hello , martha .
detective .
thanks for meeting with me again .
i just got a few more questions that we need to talk about ,
if that' s okay .
okay .
do you care if i record our conversation ?
no .
okay .
i' il just go ahead and start the tape .
what i like for you to do is go over the events again with me of friday night .
do you remember about what time kyle came to the house ?
no , i don' t .
okay .
did kyle come inside ?
yes , he did .
and did he stay very long ?
no .
they , uh ...
they talked a little bit , and , um ...
they weren' t there very long .
do you know where they went ?
no , i don' t .
okay , so when they left , it was just you and the small child .
yes .
and what did you do that evening ?
the child and i just played , and then i watched some tv and read some books and gave her some juice , and she went right to sleep .
rose had told me that it wouldn' t take her very long , and she was very good .
okay .
nothing unusual happened then ?
no .
what time did rose come home ?
it was close to 11 : 00 .
okay , and did you immediately leave or
no .
when she came in , we sat down and she asked me how jesse was , and i asked her about her date .
and , uh ...
then , of course , that man came to the door .
yeah , you told me that an individual came .
yes .
it was her ex boyfriend ?
right .
he had been
i guess he had been sitting outside waiting on her .
and did they argue ?
yes , they sure did .
you told me that they had gotten into an argument .
again , tell me what that was about .
he had said that she had stole some things from the apartment and some money .
how did it end with them ?
did it turn physical ?
well , there was a lot of yelling and ...
i' m not sure whether he shoved her , but i know she had grabbed ahold of him to try to get him out the door .
was she able to get him out of the house ?
it took awhile .
okay .
but he did ultimately leave the apartment .
yes .
yes , he did .
did you see him any more that night ?
no .
i didn' t
i just got in my car and left .
okay , and where did you go when you left ?
i went straight home .
okay .
and i spoke to your dad the night that we talked , and he said you came home about the same time that you' re saying .
um ...
is there anything else that you can tell me at this point ?
well , the thing that , you know , really bothers me is that he was waiting outside on her to get home .
uh huh .
so what if he was still there after i left ?
okay .
do you remember when we talked at your house and you indicated to me that you' d do anything you could to help with this investigation ?
yes , i did .
well , what you need to do is start telling me the truth about what happened .
so i am .
we have got the physical evidence back from the lab , and it implicates you in the death of rose hilliard .
i don' t see how .
how ?
your fingerprints were lifted off the bruises around her neck .
i don' t understand it .
now , martha , this is the opportunity for you to help yourself here .
now , either you are a cold blooded killer ,
which i don' t think is the case ...
no . or something happened in that apartment that caused you to do this .
there is no doubt that you did this .
none .
but only you can explain to me what happened , and i want you to do that .
i can' t .
i just i don' t know .
is there any way that you can explain your fingerprints around her neck ?
no , sir .
no , sir .
and the neighbors saw you leave the apartment .
you were the last one to leave the apartment .
the evidence is there .
you will be convicted of this .
you need to tell me the truth about what happened .
i don' t know .
i i don' t know .
well , the jury' s not going to believe that .
i want you to look at these photographs .
that what she looks like .
that' s what you did you her .
a jury' s not gonna have sympathy for you if you don' t show some kind of remorse .
now , it can be explained how this happened .
maybe you got into an argument with her , maybe things got out of hand .
but only you know that .
she can' t tell us .
i couldn' t have done this .
well , you did .
no , sir .
no .
no .
mr. hightower , i wanted to come over and talk to you and let you know what' s going on .
okay .
i was wondering about it .
i just finished talking with martha , and based upon my interview with her and evidence that we recovered from the scene , she' s been arrested for the murder of rose hilliard .
is that right ?
and i wanted to come over and make you aware of what' s going on because you are her family .
yes .
she' s currently at the jail and that' s where she' il be until there' s a hearing date .
what the hell .
sorry to hear it .
do you have any questions for me ?
do you know when her hearing will be ?
it' il be fairly soon .
and they will give her an attorney .
hey , martha .
hi , kyle .
i' m really glad you came .
it' s horrible in here .
yeah ?
so what' s going on ?
i don' t know .
i don' t understand .
i don' t even know why i' m here , really .
and they think i killed her .
kyle , you know me .
you know i could not have done that .
i think i really i think it' s jesse' s dad .
and i can' t i don' t know .
i don' t know what happened .
you got to help me , kyle .
you know that i would never do anything like this .
yeah .
i i don' t understand .
and it seemed like the detective
they think that i did this , and i don' t see how .
i don' t see how that can be right .
i don' t know , martha .
i don' t understand it .
i don' t know .
i don' t know what , you know , what i did .
i know that i had a really , really , really bad headache , and when he started yelling , i just wanted to go home .
and i didn' t know who he was , and when i tried to ask her who he was , she told me to mind my own business .
and that kind of made me feel bad because , i thought , you know , i thought i could talk to her like a daughter .
i mean , after all , she left me with , you know , her most prized possession : her baby .
yeah .
and she' s asked me for all kinds of favors , and i just didn' t think it was too much to ask who he was .
and she was really mad and didn' t want to talk about it .
i don' t know , martha .
you got to help me , kyle .
you got to .
i mean , i don' t what i can do , but ...
i ...
i don' t know how this happened .
we have to figure this out .
we have to .
i didn' t do it , kyle .
you know i wouldn' t do anything like that .
yeah .
i don' t know , martha .
i just i don' t understand .
i don' t either .
good morning , everyone .
we' ve obviously gone through a very tragic set of events .
it is , um ...
but we need move on , and because of that , we have gone out and we have hired kyle' s mom , helen , with the idea that
she can' t take the two ladies ' place because they are , you know
we had a longtime employee and we had a short time employee who was doing very well , but we feel like with , um
even though kyle' s mom doesn' t have a lot experience , that you guys can work with her , get her up to speed just as soon as possible .
hi .
you show me what to do .
i' il do the best i can .
help you out .
oh , my god .
