united airlines flight number 80 1 to narita
united airlines flight number 80 1 to narita is now announcing final boarding .

viktor ?
well , hi .

you can' t beat that .
but napoleon ?
yeah .
he' s one of my favorites .
you know what saved napoleon' s life ?
no .
his ego .
ego ?
yes .
after he loses the battle of waterloo ,
napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of saint helena .
he' s very depressed and decides to take his own life .
but napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job .
his stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it , and he doesn' t die .
see ?
ego .
saved his life .
maybe he need glasses .
glasses ?
yes .
to read words on bottle .
poison .
it' s funny you should say that .
rumor has it that napoleon was farsighted .
