i mean that if you made more effort , you may get a man to ask you out .
i don' t want a man to ask me out .
you know , 80 % of women who say they are too busy to have a relationship , are really lonely , audrey .
you know , i don' t feel the need to date just to stay on the right side of a survey .
and it' s bad for your skin .
what ?
my skin is always better when i' m dating .
you' re never not dating .
and just look at my complexion .
you , on the other hand ...
i , on the other hand , have stopped having this conversation .
oh my god , is this it ?
it' s an extraordinary townhouse with a total floor space of 9, 000 square feet , not including the garden .
may i ask what you do ?
it depends on the occasion .
and your friend ?
i' m just along for the ride .
this view of the dining room was recently featured in manhattan interiors magazine .
oh .
what was hanging there ?
uh , john sargent .
yeah , mr. harrison has an amazing art collection .
too bad none of it comes with the townhouse .
now if you' il follow me this way .
now this ceiling was actually handcrafted by the great grandson of charles thorpe .
that wasn' t cheap .
i guess it pays to be the emperor of infomercials .
mr. harrison made $30 million off " the hair houdini " alone .
that much ?
oh my god .
now if you' il follow me to the main bedroom .
know what , sara ?
i don' t think this is the place for you .
it' s kind of ... cramped .
cramped ?
well , it was all i could think of .
besides , i had everything i needed .
so , the sargents in the dining room are gone , the cassatt in the living room has been replaced by a lithograph , number 139 of 150 run .
over the grand piano is a framed poster of the east hampton film festival .
somewhat less valuable than the sisley that was hanging there , and whatever those monstrosities are in the hallway ... if they' re francis bacon , i' m a jimmy dean sausage .
yes , sir ...
mr. harrison' s scam is going to unravel and i will get millions off him .
but for someone else .
see , that' s the part i don' t get .
where' s the pleasure ?
winning .
thanks for today , mom .
shh ...
audrey .
i' ve asked you not to use that word in public !
that two faced , lying son of a bastard !
mary , you know i don' t like spouse bashing .
this happens all the time .
he may have hidden them , sold them ... we' il find out .
luckily , i' ve dealt with tom hoffman , the opposing counsel , in similar situations .
he' s a good lawyer , but i' m wise to his game .
hmm .
what does this mean ?
is it bad ?
no , it doesn' t mean anything .
it just means that your husband has a hired a new attorney , that' s all .
his name is daniel rafferty .
i' ve never heard of him .
me neither .
he' s new in town .
this makes me nervous .
oh , relax .
you have nothing to worry about .
a new attorney who has never practiced in new york will never get up to speed this late in the game , okay ?
you have nothing to worry about .
i have never lost one of these .
it' s fine , it' s fine .
it' s okay .
it' s not a problem .
it' s okay , everything' s okay .
you' re all right .
okay .
ready ?
that' s gary' s new attorney ?
audrey woods .
i' m representing mrs. harrison .
audrey woods .
right , for mrs. harrison .
i' ve heard good things .
that felt nice , by the way .
i realize you' re just starting to familiarize yourself with the case , but i wanted to make you aware that ... what ?
er , you got a little ... right here .
uh , thank you .
anyway , as i was saying , um , it has come to our attention that certain assets accumulated , uh ... accumulated during the marriage have not been accounted for , so i have come to what i believe is an accurate estimate of the ... of the missing ...
snoball .
i don' t settle .
i didn' t mention settling .
unless of course you' d like to give me uh ...
let me see ...
... this .
which is what i' il earn for this trial ... plus expenses .
then we' ve got something to talk about .
you must be joking .
gave it a shot .
good luck .
ms. woods , is it ?
hey , daniel .
good morning .
good morning .
good news ... opposing counsel' s insane .
all rise .
532 is now in session .
please be seated and come to order .
judge abramovitz divorced ... horribly .
very tough on men .
good morning , ladies and gentlemen .
mr. rafferty ,
i see you' re back on the east coast .
i told you the california sun is hard on the skin .
yes , but , uh , i did moisturize as per your instructions , your honor .
i' il hear opening arguments .
your honor , i would like to move for a continuance .
it' s come to our attention that discrepancies exist concerning the reporting of assets ... namely , several valuable works of art .
uh , may i interject , your honor ?
uh , you mean , um , paintings , sculpture , that kind of stuff ?
exactly .
paintings like this ?
actually , yes .
like this , uh , sisley or this morisot ?
and what have we here ?
oh , john sargent .
yes , not my kind of thing .
if i was him , i would have given them away too .
which is exactly what mr. harrison did .
all of these .
a while ago .
anonymously , of course , to a very prominent museum .
i' m surprised that mrs. harrison didn' t tell you about this , ms. woods .
see , her , uh , signature' s on the donation document .
right there .
oh , uh , that reminds me , your honor , um , i' d like to move for a continuance .
i' ve just been retained as mr. harrison' s counsel , and i haven' t had time to fully research all aspects of the case .
for instance , i have a um ... a receipt here ... for six 28 day stays at the piney woods rehab center for mrs. harrison' s treatment of sexual addiction .
i' d like to get to the bottom of that .
i' il give you one week .
thank you , your honor .
six months for sexual addiction ?
my therapist was very good .
we have to talk .
it' s not my fault that mary harrison has the iq of a dinner plate .
i' d have found out that harrison disposed of the art .
i mean , that' s why i asked for the continuance .
it' s just that this rafferty guy beat me to it .
you want him dead ?
oh , mother .
i meant socially .
i don' t know , i' ve never been up against anyone like him .
he' s very un ... something .
i can' t tell if he just got lucky or he' s ... really , really good .
maybe he' s both .
thank you , mother .
what are you eating ?
vegetables .
is this rafferty guy cute ?
i didn' t notice .
besides , he' s not your type .
he' s old enough to drive .
quick , channel 6 .
... ln court today were opening arguments in the divorce of gary " gadget " harrison .
channel 6 , mom .
harrison is being sued ... ... at stake ... a reported $97 million .
we caught up with harrison' s attorney daniel rafferty earlier today outside the courthouse .
well , we do feel that mrs. harrison' s monetary demands are outrageous .
after all , it' s mr. harrison' s products that come with a money back guarantee , not mr. harrison .
that' s incredible .
he just got into town and he' s already working the press .
and you didn' t notice if he' s cute ?
shh , call me later .
quite frankly , after this morning' s opening ...
she takes after her father .
the prenuptial will stand as agreed .
mrs. harrison' s case has about as much chance as a ... uh , snowball in hell .
okay , mr. rafferty ...
i accept .
why am i not surprised ?
hello ?
mr. rafferty ?
hello ?
thanks , benny .
anymore arrive , just put them outside my door , okay ?
oh ... oh , uh !
hey .
oh , sorry .
pardon me .
wait , wait , i' m walking here !
hey , you looking to die , lady ?
and very kindly stepping in at the last minute for erin swedland , one of new york' s most successful attorneys ; first in her class at yale , and partner at katz , cohen & phelps ...
audrey woods .
sorry .
sorry .
small world , eh ?
and another counselor kind enough to step in at the last minute .
some say there' s method in his madness .
some say madness is his method .
he' s practiced in chicago , boston , los angeles .
and i guess practice makes perfect ... because he' s never lost a case .
the " late " daniel rafferty .
mmm .
do you always look like an unmade bed ?
uh oh .
you' ve either taken an immediate dislike to me for some inexplicable reason , or you' re flirting with me .
which is it ?
i' il give you hint .
you' re getting warm with the first one .
what was the second one again ?
what are you doing here ?
at least you could be a bit more grateful .
grateful for what ?
well , my old friend lyman over there needed a replacement .
he asked me if i knew an interesting lawyer .
i happen to think you' re very interesting .
you ?
mmm .
please welcome our first panelist ...
i' m here because of you ? ... audrey woods .
you' re up .
so my advice to you is divorce doesn' t have to be agony .
look at it as a chance to examine the complex emotional labyrinth that is the human relationship .
well done , well done .
thanks , ms. woods , very enlightening .
like a nibble ?
you raise some interesting points .
no ?
and now , let' s hear from daniel rafferty .
mmm , that' s me .
any sno bits ?
hi .
thank you very much .
good morning , ladies and gentlemen .
ah , wonderful speech , ms. woods .
but , uh , this is the way i see it .
lawyers are scum .
divorce lawyers though ... are the fungus growing beneath the scum .
divorce is the post mortem of a dead marriage .
we represent people who have suddenly discovered a passion for a fight that they never knew they had in them .
where was that passion and fight when it was needed to save the marriage ?
hmm ?
don' t ask .
it' s not our jobs .
everyone loves gadgets .
and the way divorce is going these days , you' re going to get a chance to use them .
state of the art stuff for tracking the philandering husband or the unfaithful wife .
for instance , a camera this small can take a picture ... this big .
amazing , isn' t it ?
don' t you think the clarity is wonderful ?
i' m sure you people at the back can see all the roses on our suspect' s scarf .
no longer do we have to rely on crude convenient store video .
with digital capability , we can dispose of 20 closed circuit systems and achieve optimum picture quality .
now i' m sure the person ... there didn' t realize that they were being caught in the act .
wouldn' t you agree ?
remember , none of us are in divorce law for love .
i think you like him .
like him ?
are you crazy ?
sure , but i' m also your mother ... when we' re not in public .
i know , it' s a little painful , but i can see results already .
i have the lower lids of a teenager .
oh !
okay , one that' s been thrown through the windshield , but a teenager nevertheless .
i didn' t sleep a wink because of that guy .
don' t worry , i' m going to catch him with his guard down , and then kick him in the body part of my choosing .
just be careful , you' ve never lost a big case .
well , neither has he .
and that' s just irresistible .
mother !
i' m sorry .
that' s it .
i' il apologize .
to rafferty ?
why ?
you haven' t done anything wrong .
exactly .
so it' il be the last thing he' s expecting .
it' s the perfect strategy .
a sincere apology is just a manipulating tactic ,
like ... like forgiveness , or generosity .
he' il fall for it .
he' s not from new york .
you are so adorable when you' re going for the kill .
hi .
i came to apologize .
oh ... you' re bothering to knock .
don' t you usually just break and enter ?
hysterical .
and i didn' t break and enter .
if you review your surveillance tape ... you know , just how paranoid are you by the way ?
you' il notice that your office was open and my intention was to have a meeting .
my apology is for any confusion .
oh .
i don' t know what to say .
come in " would be nice .
come in .
actually , you' re lucky i don' t sue you for injuries sustained when i picked up those file boxes .
i cite " gibbon v. masters ... treacherous conditions in the workplace .
you , uh , sustained an injury ?
i broke a nail .
open your present .
oh , look at that .
very nice .
i thought you' d enjoy owning one without a stain .
interesting presumption .
you gave a very good speech yesterday , by the way .
very provocative .
the , uh , " butter wouldn' t melt " guide to divorce .
i take the high road .
i use the law , not cheap theatrics .
okay .
meeting' s a good idea .
so let' s get on with it .
excuse me ?
let' s meet over dinner .
and since you initiated it , protocol dictates that you should take me , don' t you think ?
yes , of course .
or ... we could eat here .
i have snickers .
hello , leslie , would you book my table
at the four seasons , please ?
no , no , no , no , no .
my choice .
bye , leslie .
all right , as long as it isn' t outside .
there' s a 65 % chance of rain tonight .
there' s a low pressure system coming out of the northwest .
i watch the weather channel .
could you be more fascinating ?
de colombia o de brasil
cul caf se va a servir ?
rico frio y culto es ud .
qu expresito quiere beber ?
ah , dos huevos de chivo , por favor .
huevos de chivo ?
with the huevo ?
oh , si .
god , i love this place .
it' s so romantic , no ?
no .
oh .
so what was all this high morality , passion within a marriage crap you were spouting ?
well , don' t you ever just want to slap your clients , tell them to go home and sort it out ?
actually , no , i don' t .
each case i handle convinces me further that marriage is dead in the water .
i see .
i see ?
yep .
that' s it ?
you see ?
yes , i do .
i see a lot .
are you dating anyone ?
you see a lot ... am i dating anyone ?
what kind of a segue is that ?
i don' t think you are .
ohh , this is what you see .
you see that i couldn' t be dating anyone ?
i could be dating , mister .
trust me , okay ?
i could be dating a whole big deal .
i could be lobbying for a 12 day week ,
i' m dating so much , okay ?
oh , what is this ?
what is this , " arms in the air , i rest my case " thing ?
what is that ?
you' re not dating .
why not ?
okay , since you ask ...
you' re beautiful ...
what is dating anyway ?
intelligent .
it' s trial marriage .
i' m eating with the most beautiful ...
what ?
trial marriage ?
i thought you just said marriage was dead in the water .
and that' s why i don' t date .
subject closed .
how about you ?
how about me , what ?
you dating anyone ?
i thought you just closed that subject .
i just reopened it .
i see .
you mean , apart from tonight ?
this isn' t a date .
this is a meeting .
seriously ?
yes , seriously .
my first response is always the truth .
it' s a rule i live by , personally and professionally .
a person' s first response is what they truly feel .
oh , that' s very good , very profound .
i mean , i couldn' t agree more .
but can' t we reach a compromise , call it an intimate meeting ?
intimacy doesn' t change a thing .
business is business .
oh , come on , you don' t mean that .
oh , boy .
don' t you try to analyze me with your disheveled , bohemian , " my socks don' t match , therefore i have insight to all things " whacko mindset .
there are no psychoanalytical shortcuts into my pants , okay ?
dos huevos de chivos .
gracias .
mmm .
oh , look , medical waste in a glass .
no umbrella ?
okay , you' re gonna have to drink this .
this is an old cuban tradition i learned .
before the duel , the two opponents drink the huevo de chivo together .
it means " just because i' m trying to kill you , doesn' t mean i don' t love and respect you .
huevo de chivo .
ohh !
ahh !
what the hell was that ?
huevo de chivo .
goat' s nut .
goat' s nut ?
i just had a goat' s nut in my mouth ?
no , it' s a cherry .
it' s a cherry .
look , it' s a maraschino cherry .
mmm , there you go .
too strong for you ?
not at all .
let' s have another .
no .
no , this is lethal stuff .
really ?
yeah .
waitress ? !
oh , no .
huevo de chivo .
huevo de chivo .
mmm .
hah !
uh oh .
did you bring an umbrella , mrs. weather channel ?
65 % ?
i mean , if you' d said 85 or 90 ...
yeah , and it' s precisely that 25 % extra that you need and i don' t .
and there' s a difference between how you and i need different percentages .
because if my style is 6 5 and you' re 8 5 ...
whooo !
i' m a little drunk .
yeah .
well , at least we' il be equally hung over when we see judge abramovitz in the morning .
yeah , you and her , what' s up with that ?
oh , my mouth has gone numb .
i can' t feel anything .
can you ?
i felt that okay .
hey .
hey , you' re not supposed ... yeah .
you ?
oh !
oh my god .
what have i done ?
cup of coffee ?
due in court , 45 minutes .
clothes are in the dryer .
the dryer ?
i wore panties .
that much i remember .
did i do anything last night i might regret ?
i hope not .
ohh .
oh , dear .
oh , dear .
at least we' il both arrive in court looking like hell .
ready ?
oh , come on !
what' s wrong ?
i mean , you always say i look like crap .
don' t you like it ?
tie looks good .
$97 million , your honor .
and yet he is trying to hold my client to a penurious prenuptial which we have shown is clearly suspect .
mary harrison is entitled to at least half of his assets and a continuing percentage of profit in his corporation .
you don' t really mean that .
what ?
i' m sorry to interrupt , ms. woods , but are you suggesting that because the number is so large , your client is entitled to more than was agreed upon in the prenup ?
because that was not your position last night , assuming you remember last night' s ... position .
i am speaking ... this morning of two people who are husband and wife ... two people who shared eight years together ...
a wife who in their most intimate moments inspired her husband' s greatest creations .
oh , what did you say ?
it was brilliant .
i wrote it down somewhere .
um ... there you go .
here .
um ... " intimacy doesn' t change a thing .
business is business .
how dare you !
okay !
okay !
this is how i see it .
according to the state of new york ,
mrs. harrison signed a prenuptial agreement that no one has proven to me is flawed in any way .
so the court finds the document holds and assets shall be divided according to its provisions .
case dismissed .
and whatever the two of you got going on , take it outside .
you know , i' ve come to think we have a great success on our hands here and uh ...
one moment , please .
audrey !
audrey , wait !
audrey .
audrey , wait !
wait just one moment .
come on .
come on , let me explain .
please , just let me explain , all right ?
counselor , you are now operating in a morality free void
in which all bets are off .
you don' t get it , do you ?
i just paid you the ultimate compliment .
compliment ?
you forced me to fight dirtier in there than i' ve ever had to do before .
that' s how good you are .
oh , please , save the l. a. schmooze for judge judy .
you owe me an apology .
like the apology you gave me last night ?
okay , i was trying to soften you up .
and then i let you seduce me so you' d think you had the upper hand .
you let me seduce you ?
you let me ?
are you wounded , mr. rafferty ?
hey , hey , hey , last night was very special .
there' s no need to trash it just because i beat you .
hey , you know , you need to toughen up a little bit .
if i got bruised by every lawyer i bagged
i' d living in a padded cell in bellevue by now .
you finished with these ?
bagged ?
you actually used the word " bagged " ?
right on the courthouse steps in the 21st century .
wow .
and how many have you bagged ?
none .
that' s not the point , mother .
shh shh !
audrey , look at me .
i don' t know why you have developed this inability to admit when you' re attracted to someone .
it' s not healthy and you know it .
and one day , i promise you you will wake up with a wedding ring on your finger and you will be the happiest person in the world to be married .
i am not attracted to him .
i just hate that dealing with him had to get so low down .
you decided to practice divorce law .
at what point did you think it was going to get really classy ?
the new serenas .
who ?
serena , the hottest new designer out there .
never heard of her .
of course you have .
she' s married to thorne jamison .
who ?
he' s the lead singer of the needles .
honey , he just signed a huge recording contract ... 80 zillion or something .
oh , serena .
she understands the last thing to go on a woman are her shoulders .
she' s bound to win the nobel prize .
at least .
focus , audrey , focus !
well , actually mr. harrison said i inspired him to come up with one of his new inventions .
uh ... what' s it called ?
the paperpusher .
huh , did you get a cut of that ?
uh , no .
no , not at all .
uh , just winning gary' s case was enough .
yes , and your courtroom tussles with counselor audrey woods are becoming , uh , quite the talk of the town in legal circles .
well , well , well , what can i say ?
i mean , audrey woods is uh ...
well , she' s the finest attorney i' ve ever met .
hmm .
i can only aspire to be as clever as her .
right .
she' s uh ... she' s wonderful .
really wonderful .
huh ?
and you' ve just published this book on divorce ,
a guide to a happy divorce .
that' s right .
book ?
book ?
what book ? !
it' s got excellent reviews .
when does he write books ? !
outside of new york' s biggest divorce trial since gary harrison' s last april , the case of basketball legend
adamo shandela and his wife irene ... the trial which has two of the city' s top divorce pit bulls
audrey woods and daniel rafferty against each other once again .
now the verdict has just been handed down .
wait a minute , i' m told he' s on his way out .
adamo , how does it feel to have the verdict go your way ?
well , i just feel lucky to have the best lawyer in new york on my side , you know what i' m saying ?
ms. woods , in a case that' s had to reveal so much indelicate information about the petitioner' s private life , you' ve really been commended on your aboveboard tactics .
it' s all about doing your homework , researching every aspect of the law , burning the midnight oil ... you have to be prepared for anything .
you know , if it' s one thing that i' ve learned , it' s don' t get caught in court with your pants down .
ah , that' s good .
objection , your honor .
counsel is , as usual , making assumptions .
overruled , ms. woods !
opposing counsel is clearly kidding herself if she believes ...
irrelevant , mr. rafferty .
full documentation here , your honor .
everything you need to know .
videotapes are irrelevant , mr. rafferty .
no room for argument .
objection , your honor .
counsel is badgering .
motion denied again , ms. woods .
get off the desk , mr. rafferty .
ms. woods , this court has absolutely no interest in your opinion of mr. rafferty' s choice of socks .
ms. woods ' capacity for alcohol has no relevance to these proceedings .
bailiff !
no , clearly you did not ,
counselors !
counselors !
because ... no , no ...
if i want to sit through personal attacks , yelling , screaming foul language , bickering , i' il spend the afternoon with my family in scarsdale , understand ?
yes , your honor .
it may be cool though , especially from boston northward here , across parts of maine ... and throughout portions of new england .
only 52 in burlington , 51 in ...
it' s audrey .
i' m not here right now , so leave a message .
even if i was here , i wouldn' t take calls from you .
we both know that' s not true .
listen , i' m sorry to bother you , but it' s really overcast downtown here and i thought you just might have an inside track from the weather channel , you know , and what time it' s gonna start raining .
okay .
look , if you want me to leave you alone , i will .
but for the record i think it' s a great shame .
so ... take care .
hello ?
oh , you are there .
yeah , i just picked up the phone to tell you to leave me alone .
i just said i was going to leave you alone .
i know , i' m just telling you that i want you to .
you don' t mean that .
trust me .
on the first bit or the second bit ?
both .
i' m confused .
what about ?
i' m not sure .
perhaps you could send me a tape of this .
don' t be ridiculous .
have dinner with me .
i' m not hungry .
i didn' t mean right now .
well , neither did i.
honey !
i have to go .
so this is how you' re spending saturday night , eating junk food and watching the weather channel ?
i have tickets to thorne jamison and the needles .
let' s go .
to a rock concert ?
sex , drugs and rock and roll is your thing , mom , not mine .
get ready to roll back the dice
freddy' s burning up in satan' s fahrenheit
crash landing from a snowball parasite
television is the devil' s chosen fun
ohhh singing at the moon
seaside pleasure and all that shagging around
fall into your head , she said what she said
get ready to roll back the dice
fall out of your bed , we' il wake up the dead
get ready to roll back the dice .
oh my god , i think i' m deaf .
hey , are you all right ?
do you want to tell me about it ?
he' s an asshole .
i hate him .
he screws everything .
if i don' t divorce him , i' m gonna kill him !
ugh !
listen , can i give you some advice ?
you' re very young .
relationships take work , and ... and lots of couples go through rough patches .
and there' s always a way to get through them .
you know , divorce should be a last resort .
this is something i know a little bit about .
you' re wearing my blouse wrong .
it should be worn off the shoulder .
you have nice shoulders .
are you serena ?
so your husband is ...
the fathead on stage ?
yeah .
let me give you my card .
i just want you to know , mrs. jamison ,
that if you should choose katz , cohen & phelps ,
i take care of my clients .
we are considered the tiffany' s of new york law firms .
yeah , well , i wish it was home depot so you could rip his heart out with a chainsaw .
well , there' s that approach too .
here' s to audrey and her new client serena , and all the money she' s going to bring in to the company .
no , it' s not definite yet .
it' s not definite yet .
the gentleman asked me to send you this .
thank you .
what in god' s name is that ?
you' ve never had a goat' s nut ?
i can' t say that i have .
hey , man , what' s going on ?
would you excuse me for a moment ?
do you think that' s really a goat' s nut in there ?
oh , ms. woods , look at that .
uh , i see you' re celebrating over there .
would you like to join us ?
ah , i just wanted to say hello to serena .
well , you' re a fan .
well , who isn' t ?
uh , serena , audrey woods .
serena' s my new client .
sadly , she' s getting a divorce .
yes , i know .
oh , you do ?
oh well , i guess these things hit the papers .
no , i know , because up until 30 seconds ago
i thought she was going to hire me to represent her .
what ?
that' s a good look , counselor .
did you practice that in the mirror ?
hey , i decided to use someone else .
thing is , in the meetin ' you were all up in that
high road , let' s keep it clean , no need to get ugly " stuff .
then i read his book .
danny' s what i want .
he' il cut thorne' s balls off and give ' em back as earrings .
but in all fairness , uh , serena , it should be noted that ms. woods is very capable of cutting men' s balls off .
all right .
sorry , that came out all wrong .
um , just so you know , the jacket wasn' t designed to be worn with a belt .
okay .
i' il be right back .
you stole serena to spite me .
come on in .
cubicle 2 is free , i believe .
i didn' t steal anything .
she read my book and came to me , i mean it .
i don' t think you mean anything you say .
well , that , i' m afraid , is gonna have to remain your problem .
but ...
i don' t lie .
i don' t approve of it .
when have i ever lied to you ?
well , let me tell you something , buddy ,
if you are taking this case to mess with me , things are gonna get really ugly .
uglier than this ?
and let me tell you something , if i may ... if you were able to turn down your self serving paranoia to a gentle simmer for a brief moment , you might just discover that you and i could actually co exist quite successfully .
and i don' t mean only professionally .
don' t forget to wash your hands .
what , are you ... going for a world record ?
hello , girls .
all right , form in a queue .
take this , take this .
i' m sure i can fit you all in .
what' s your name , my little girl ?
cindy .
hey , sign it .
yeah ?
i had a dog called that once .
and how long have you been a " thornehead " ?
forever .
i love you , thorne !
yeah , i love you too , babe .
see this , barry .
i' ve got classy fans too .
and uh ... what might you want ?
i want you .
ooh , chihuahua !
nice opening line .
i like it .
direct , no bs ... just how i like it .
mmm .
okay , tell me what we' re working with , doll face .
okay , this is what we' re working with , doll face .
you' ve got a devoted , hardworking wife at home , and yet you cheat , lie , and blow all your money on strippers and whores .
you finally abandoned her , leaving her no option but to file for divorce .
that' s the opposing counsel' s opening line .
direct , no bs ... just the way you like it .
and your wife has just hired the second best divorce attorney in new york city to deliver it .
now you need someone to tell your side of the story , no matter how sordid , and make you seem like strawberry shortcake .
i like strawberry shortcake , and i like your style .
do you know what i think ?
i think we should continue this conversation ... back at my place .
you know what i think ?
what ?
i think you should leave the thinking to me .
right .
pain ?
i' il cause her so much pain she' il wish she never ...
before i came along , the only business decision he ever made was whether to pay a hooker with cash or credit . ... the purpose of a settlement hearing is to avoid ...
you should advise your client that documentable threats of violence ...
makes my job so much easier .
threats , my ass !
can we skip to the part where you cut his balls off ? !
if we could convince ms. woods to go through the motions of discussing assets .
assets ?
she doesn' t have any .
i' m the one who spits up all the money for those dish rags she sells .
dish rags ?
tell that to nicole kidman .
she wore my dishrags to the oscars , okay ? !
nyah , nyah , nyah ...
i' m sure that mr. rafferty will agree that we' il not get anywhere without a degree of consideration from all parties .
consideration from him ?
i' m his goddamn wife .
and he didn' t even have the courtesy to tell me that he got a skull and cross bones pierced through the tip of his ...
i have enough .
i' m good .
mmm .
look , forget it , okay ?
i' m not interested in his money .
i make a good living .
there' s only one thing i want .
uh huh , and what is that ?
caislen and clocha .
oh , yes , i remember seeing that somewhere .
what is it ?
it' s the most magical place on earth .
mmm .
it' s our castle in ireland .
it' s my fairytale castle .
it' s summer now , the kids are back inside
gotta ticket for a ...
ha ha .
and in here , this is the ... stay .
this is where we like to rehearse ...
stay .
ha ha .
jam with the boys in the band .
this is where i like to play with my fruit machines .
feeling lucky .
feeling lucky !
ahh .
uh , gold , gold , gold , gold , silver .
who' s is that ?
that' s not mine .
billy !
i hadn' t become my true self at that point .
i was still a bit ... stupid .
and it' s got like 100 bedrooms .
i don' t know , maybe even less .
serena uses one for her hobbies and shit ... she likes to sew stuff .
oh , here she is .
i love him , i love him , i love him !
isn' t she great ?
he' s all mine !
he' s all mine !
she may have been on drugs at that point .
nah , just you , baby .
you might be able to use that .
oh , and come and see my wheels .
billy !
okay , that was good .
so this is what you want ?
kezzlin and kloik .
clocha .
caislen clocha .
right .
so this is what you want ?
yeah .
it means " castle of rock .
i mean , how many more ... appropriate can you get , you know ?
uh , when i found that out , i had to have it , right ?
and it was your decision to buy , uh , cais ...
caisl ...
le cle ... the castle ... the rock castle ?
hell yes .
all right .
i told thorne " we have to live here .
so it was your decision to buy it ?
i called the realtor right away , yeah .
hello ?
oh , hello , counselor .
yes , i may have good news too .
well , it looks as though this thing might end amicably after all .
yes .
we' re in serious danger of peace breaking out .
which will make me very happy indeed .
me too .
anyway , i have spoken to my client .
so have i.
she only wants the ...
he only wants ...
she only wants the ...
he only wants the ...
go to ireland , depose the staff at the castle ,
and we' il sort this out .
yes , your honor .
oh , i see .
you' re after hiring a car .
that' s why i' m here , mr. o' callaghan .
oh , well , you' ve come to the right place .
good .
only see , thing is , we' re not open on a tuesday .
sorry ?
yeah , see , i' m not here on a tuesday .
i know , i know what you' re thinking .
if i' m not here on a tuesday and we' re not open on a tuesday and today is tuesday and i' m standing here , then how can it be ?
well now , it all depends on how you look at it .
you see , normally ...
see , if it' s tuesday , and i' m not there even though it' s tuesday , come back sometime when it' s not tuesday .
hey !
hey !
excuse me !
excuse me !
thank you so much .
could you please ...
where did you get this goddamn thing ?
top of the mornin ' to you .
caislen clocha , is it ?
hop in .
in there ?
with you ?
oh , okay .
well , it' s really not that far .
i mean , you just carry on straight down this road here .
after about , oh , eight miles you' il see a signpost for the devil' s staircase and uh ... well , apparently the castle is just the other side .
so , where did you get it ?
uh , mr. o' callaghan back in the village .
he' s not open on a tuesday .
no , i borrowed this from mr. o' callaghan the butcher down the road .
he' s mr. o' callaghan , the car hire man' s , uncle .
and you see , every tuesday ...
i don' t want to know .
oh , it' s beautiful .
if you can touch the horizon you' re near your journey' s end .
james joyce ?
no , my uncle clive .
but equally profound , wouldn' t you say ?
well , that spoiled it for me .
what am i going to tell mr. o' callaghan ?
isn' t fog the most incredible natural phenomenon ?
see , in rocky areas like this , the temperature of the rocks in the daytime is much cooler than the earth so ... what happens ...
weather channel .
it is now midnight .
look , look .
i know we' re a bit lost , i admit that , but we' re very close .
we' re very close , i can smell it .
see , i think if ...
wait a second .
what ?
look , over here .
there' s some old trailer .
ohh .
oh my god !
i think we' ve landed on our feet .
see if you can get some light going .
oh yeah , then i' il run your bath and get dinner on .
hey , listen , we' re in this together .
we' re a team , okay ?
yeah , for now .
whoo , it stinks !
there we go .
well , all in all , i think we' ve done quite well .
we ?
hey , listen , i got the light going , didn' t i ?
oh yeah , forgive me .
i don' t know what i would have done without you .
actually , i don' t know how you do it .
you write books , you appear on tv , you perform your stand up routine in court .
are you taking your clothes off ?
well , just ... just ... just the bottoms .
i mean , you know , they' re covered in slime .
ugh !
why did i do that ?
and in your spare time , you work for the irish tourist board .
and your point is ?
i was doing fine on my own .
oh , come on , let' s be honest .
you were lost until i came along .
oh , slightly metaphorical .
anyway , come on .
lie down .
you look tired .
you need to rest .
what , so you can get to caislen click before me ?
it' s not " click .
it' s clocha .
clocha .
caislen clocha .
kluhh ... kuhh .
clocha ... it' s not even a word .
what kind of a word is that ?
it' s an irish word .
we' re in ireland .
learn to adapt .
i can adapt .
i' m very adaptable as a matter of fact .
i' m probably more adaptable than you .
oh .
and a word of advice .
yes ?
never tell a woman she looks tired .
boy , you just summed yourself up in one sentence .
all consuming , competitive spirit meets rampant insecurity .
now why ... why would someone as accomplished and as clever as you be so insecure , hmm ?
i' il tell you what , you spend your teenage years as the pimply , gangly daughter of the most beautiful woman in the world , and get back to me .
you better not leave me .
never .
oh .
oh my lord .
we were this close ?
uh huh .
the hell with thorne and serena .
i want it .
well , duty calls .
yep .
so you think you can get the servants to back up your claim ?
well , i guess we' il find out .
i guess we will .
hello , there .
welcome to caislen clocha .
hello , i' m audrey woods .
i' m daniel rafferty .
i' m representing mr. jamison .
i' m representing mrs. jamison .
i' m wondering would it be possible to speak to the staff for a moment ,
just a little bit ? ... lnterview them for a while ?
ah , would you be the posh lawyers over from america , then ?
yes .
that' s grand .
well , they all agree with me so far .
me too .
brendan , i' m going to need to interview the staff again .
i' m not getting anywhere .
i' m afraid you' il be out of luck there , sir , sure .
they' il all be down at the festival .
it' s the village' s anniversary .
it celebrates the couple who founded the place nearly 200 years ago .
it' s a lovely story .
they were deeply in love but her father didn' t approve , so they ran away here and got married in secret .
and every year we have a festival in their honor .
it' s very romantic .
singing and dancing .
aw , that' s nice .
so basically , the old fella didn' t like this scottish knight nailin ' his daughter ,
et cetera , et cetera , blah , blah , blah .
so it' s basically , a lame excuse for a three day booze up .
so is it the wild woman of the bogs herself ?
i' d never' ve recognized ya .
aye , you' re cuttin ' a fine figure this evening ,
even if i do say so me self .
and you look like you' re ...
you' re wearing ... that .
you don' t like it ?
no , no , you got kind of a ...
lenny kravitz meets kiss without the makeup " thing going on .
never too old to rock and roll , huh ?
you heard the story of this place ?
yeah , it' s all little elves and leprechauns for me .
oh .
well , i thought it was rather charming .
there you go .
oh , what' s this ?
oh , it looks like poteen .
" poo " what ?
it' s not " poo .
it' s puh , puh ...
puh cheen .
it' s a traditional irish drink , slightly illegal .
it' s like moonshine .
oh , so that' s gaelic for " goats nut .
cheers .
ah !
i was right .
it is poo .
could i have the pleasure of this dance with you , miss ?
oh , you know what , i can' t ...
oh , she' d love to .
and i' m working .
go on .
go on .
i' m working !
you' il soon pick it up .
i' m working here .
no !
make sure to keep those legs up .
whoo !
come on .
you , come on .
no , no , you go .
are you dancing ?
no , i' m not .
no , madam , i' m not .
i' m slightly indisposed .
my ankle and stuff like this .
i' d love to , but ...
oh , don' t be so soft .
no !
get yourself up here .
bejesus , you' re a wholesome strap of a woman .
are you married ?
would you excuse me for a moment ?
ho ho !
i can' t leave you alone for a second , can i ?
come on , honey , let' s go .
i' m serious this time .
i' m sorry .
let' s go .
go !
go !
go !
go !
go !
yeah !
yeah !
yeah !
oh , lovely .
lovely .
fine .
here you go .
thanks !
all right !
here you go , a drink for the little guy .
cheers !
ladies and gentlemen , please take your places at the wedding circle .
the vows you have taken are holy and binding .
you' ve exchanged rings as a token of your eternal love .
i now pronounce you man and wife .
you may kiss the bride .
aww ...
that' s beautiful .
it' s a lovely story .
they were deeply in love , so they ran away here and got married in secret .
it' s very romantic .
the vows you have taken are holy and binding .
you' ve exchanged rings as a token of your eternal love .
i now pronounce you man and wife .
you may kiss the bride .
oh my god .
oh ... my ...
god .
god .
oh .
ahhhh !
okay , okay .
wake up !
wake up !
oh , morning .
wake up !
would you please look at your left hand , please ?
what .
oh .
please !
oh , would you look at that ?
oh , you got one too .
daniel , did we get married last night ?
yes , i have a feeling we did .
the details are a little bit fuzzy , oh , oh ... but i think the bride was scintillating ... in her figure hugging serena outfit and ... you' re not happy .
do i look happy ? !
well , it' s hard to say , i mean , because you never seem to be happy around me and i always seem to make you angry and ...
oh , oh , oh , it' s all coming back .
we got to find the guy that did this and tell him we didn' t mean it .
well , what if i did mean it ?
of course you didn' t .
how could you ?
you don' t want to be married to me !
mrs. flanagan !
mrs. flanagan !
mrs. flanagan !
oh , mrs. flanagan !
how do you know ?
anybody up ? !
ugh , i still don' t get it .
how can a whole town be off on a thursday for no apparent reason ?
we' re just gonna have to file when we get back to new york , okay ?
it' il be like it never happened .
but it did happen .
what happened is tied to a much larger issue .
lot' s of people get drunk without tying the knot .
i mean , when one' s inhibitions are down , one acts on one' s true feelings .
sanderson v. sanderson ...
supreme court , illinois , 1993 .
you' re citing case laws to support this insanity ?
we got married last night for goodness sake .
that means something .
yeah , it means that we drank too much and made a mistake again .
phooey !
hi .
hi .
we just got married .
congratulations .
thank you .
stop telling people .
she' s the first one .
yeah , but this kind of news spreads .
i' il come back .
hmm .
oh my god .
what ?
we can' t be married and be opposing counselors .
why not ?
can i say something ?
we' il look ridiculous .
and no you cannot .
why not ?
we' il be the laughing stock of the new york bar association because you will say something contrary just to be contrary .
only this is my marriage too .
you see what i mean ?
oh , my head is thumping .
ahh !
ugh !
will you look at that ?
you just broke the little fella' s leg right off .
he' s legless .
i liked that .
i was going to save that as a souvenir .
hmm .
i' m sorry , daniel .
i' ve known you for 35 years .
alcohol has a very bad effect on you .
you get hyper , you get aggressive , you get married .
no one at the office can know , so i have to research whatever legal system
county clare operates under .
well , why don' t you just file here if that' s what you want ?
oh , that' s a great idea .
it' il take the press exactly two seconds to find out that i got drunk and married and divorced in 24 hours .
given my vast experience with divorce ... and it is vast ... my guess is that there' s a lot of wiggle room .
hell , you could probably get it annulled as long as you didn' t ... never mind .
i have to start wiggling first thing in the morning .
mm hmm .
mother , what is this ?
oh , the girls and i are having a lip party later .
you can join us if you like .
david takes fat out of our butts and injects it into our lips .
that gives a whole new meaning to " talking outta your ass .
hello ?
better pick up the new york post
before you file for divorce .
page 6 .
what ? !
off to get one of these ?
why did you tell them this ?
are you crazy ?
you think i did that ?
why would i do that , when you made it abundantly clear that being married was the last thing you wanted to be , especially to me ?
can i ?
what are you doing ?
i' m calling the post to tell them they made a mistake .
daniel ...
or that we made a mistake .
which should i say ?
no , no , no , put ... put the ... please , please , please , put the phone down .
l ...
i' m n ...
i' m not trying to be hurtful here .
just bear with me for a minute , okay ?
trust me .
mm hmm .
in the way that you trust me ?
okay , listen .
we got married whether we like it or not .
and it seems that it was , if nothing else , a little impulsive .
personally , i blame the " poo " drink .
now we' re back in new york , and on opposite sides of a major case ,
so whatever we may or may not do in the future in the short term ...
i agree .
what ?
i agree .
it' s the only thing we can do ... in the short term .
i haven' t said what i was going to say .
you were going to say that we have to appear married or we will seriously screw up our careers .
so ... that only leaves one question , doesn' t it ?
forgive me if i get emotional , but this is the day every mother dreams of ... the day she gets to watch her only daughter put a lock on the bedroom door to keep her husband out .
oh , stop it , mother .
it may have been a wedding , but it is not a marriage .
hi , i' m the husband .
hi , i' m the mother .
oh .
mmm ?
uh , this is your room .
i made some room in the closet even though it looks like you never hang anything up .
hmm .
bathroom' s through there .
oh , she' s back to her old self .
that seems promising .
i told you darling , we don' t need separate bedrooms .
i don' t mind you snoring .
can i use the kitchen ?
he cooks .
you never told me he cooks .
yes , well , it' s been a strange couple of days .
i' m sure she' il come around , don' t worry .
shouldn' t i be saying that to you ?
yes , oh , i' ve enjoyed reading about you in the society pages .
are you , uh , really 56 ?
parts of me are .
ah .
would you like a cocktail ?
oh , yes , please .
mmm .
only if it' s an extremely large one .
okay .
i made brownies .
i' ve given up sugar .
it was a crutch .
what ?
is that what you' re wearing ?
what' s the matter with it ?
nothing , nothing .
it ... it just needs ... something .
we' re married , remember ?
we have to make it look like we mean it ... even if we don' t .
let me .
well , say something .
uh ... um ... did you get yourself one too ?
you want me to do it or you ?
uh ... eh ...
i can do it .
there , now we can fool anyone , eh ?
i guess .
all right , all right !
quiet back there !
i can' t hear you !
i can' t hear you !
you pussy !
here you go .
oh , thanks .
you' re welcome .
just shut up .
why can' t you shut up and listen ?
why can' t you fall under a snowplow ?
it' s summer .
yeah , i' il buy you one as a parting gift .
... so i looked like 12 .
oh , your mother called earlier .
hey , i ran into tracey abramovitz today .
oh , tracey , tracey .
four million ?
aspen ?
jeez .
... it looks like it is going to cut its way through the mid atlantic states .
so later on in the day ...
new york and also around , say , the stanton area ... you may see an isolated shower or thunderstorm .
... still soggy across new england , otherwise high pressure settles into the mid atlantic coast and it' il be dry in the morning tomorrow .
new york' s shore forecast for today , 75 ...
hmm .
and not only did serena renovate and decorate ...
yes , indeed , save caislen clocha ... she restored the gardens .
she reached out into the community , single handedly reviving the ancient textile industry in the area , pumping revenue back into the economy .
yeah , she was pumping the gardener as well .
shove it !
ms. woods , if you don' t put a muzzle on him ...
your honor , my client is simply making the point that while he was away working hard to pay for the castle , his wife' s activities may not have been entirely altruistic .
if fidelity is at issue here , we can happily produce receipts documenting mr. jamison' s tour of the world' s brothels .
yeah !
nice .
all right , all right !
quiet back there !
ahh !
what is the relevance of this ?
i' m suggesting that mrs. jamison doesn' t deserve to be awarded a $3 million castle simply because she hung some curtains and was popular with the help .
why not ?
she shouldn' t be denied her standard of living , especially when her husband over there forked out four million on a love shack for his mistress in aspen .
how do you know that ?
i ...
i said don' t tell no one about aspen !
what about all that lawyer client crap ? !
i will not stand for this behavior in the courtroom .
you don' t even know how to ski !
just shut it .
i want a divorce .
it was an accident .
i swear .
i was taking out the garbage , the bag broke ... ... and then in the middle of the battle ...
i don' t believe you .
so ... you want a divorce ?
yes .
so one little hiccup and we give in , eh ?
just like all the saps we represent ?
do not throw your take on life and marriage at me
like some moral battering ram .
and what about the professional fallout you seem so desperate to avoid ?
well ...
i' m sorry , i don' t believe in divorce .
you don' t believe in divorce ?
how can you say that ?
you make your living ...
it' s a job !
but in those miserable couples , what do we see ?
what do we really see ?
us .
we see us !
people who have made a huge mistake ...
no , no , no , no !
we see people who are not willing to fight .
you have to fight for what you believe in .
fight fair , fight dirty , but fight !
people who are supposed to fight to save a marriage have to be in a marriage they want to be in !
i am !
that' s bullshit !
no , it isn' t !
let me tell you something .
i' m not in this marriage to save my career ,
i' m sorry to disappoint you , but i don' t care about my career !
but i do care about you ...
and so i will give you a divorce , gladly , because ... call me old fashioned , but when you love someone ...
i believe you should be unselfish enough to give them whatever they want .
i' il be around later to pick up my things .
hello ?
mom ?
hello ?
hi , sara , it' s arlene .
arlene , can i call you back ?
i have audrey with me .
darling , you can' t live your life trying to avoid the mistakes i' ve made .
you' ve got to make your own .
you think i' m making one ?
i don' t know what to tell you , honey .
all i know is that i' m running out of favors .
do you have any idea how hard it is to place an item on page six of the new york post ?
oh .
it' il be all right .
i had thorne jamison' s 12 year old assistant on the phone this morning .
don' t ask me how she got my private line ... it' s unlisted .
anyway , she has informed me that your client will not be appearing in court today , as he has gone back to his castle in ireland .
which as you know has not yet been awarded to either party and is , as such , off limits .
now i' m going to give you 48 hours to get him back here or i' m going to dismiss this case for failure to prosecute .
are you okay ?
i' m fine .
oh , welcome back .
hello , mrs. flanagan .
is mr. jamison in ?
oh my god !
oh , no .
oh my god !
are you ... oh !
get off of me !
oh , i uh ...
i i' m so sorry .
i thought y you ... you screamed .
yeah , don' t you ?
nice one , babe .
yeah , no ... well ... see , uh , we ... we both got here on separate planes and , uh , we were just about to get stuck into tearing the place apart when mrs. f comes in and says , " happy anniversary .
seven years .
you was just a baby , weren' t you ?
see , we got married here in the local village .
anyway , we decided to make it work .
you know , whatever , right ?
yeah
you can' t give up , right ?
no .
i couldn' t agree more .
audrey .
hello .
what are you both doing here , anyway ?
i came to tell you you' re not legally allowed to be here .
yeah , but we are .
yeah , ' cause like we own it .
but , uh , you know , thanks for coming all this way .
michael !
you must both stay for some nosh .
yes , sir ?
ah , hello there .
if it isn' t themselves .
how are you ?
ah , michael , uh , will you tell mrs. flanagan that we will be two extra for din dins ?
no problem , sir .
so you work here as well ?
as well as what ?
being a priest .
oh , i see !
yeah , the old festival .
ah , no , i just do that for a bit of fun .
i have an ecclesiastical demeanor apparently .
so ... you' re not a real priest ?
oh , goodness me , no .
still , i see you went ahead and did it for real .
i can always tell the ones who will .
congratulations .
so ... so that means then ...
oh , no !
oh , god .
well ... the last thing anyone in this room seems to need is a divorce attorney .
i won' t stay for supper , if it' s all the same to you .
excuse me .
well , ah ...
ah , thanks .
anyway , uh ... both of you have been great .
i i i had no idea the legal system was so deep .
are you okay ?
no , i don' t think so .
do you know what i think ?
i think you two have had a lover' s tiff .
yeah ... yeah , we did , kinda .
yeah , well , you gotta get over it .
you know , you were the one who said you could get through the bad patches , that breaking up was the last resort .
or something like that .
yes , i did .
will you give me a ride ?
do you know the way ?
do i know the way ?
i know ireland like the back of my hand .
yeah , right .
along giant' s pass , through paddy' s cross , over the bridge , and back to paddy' s cross .
we' re lost .
no , no , no , no , i should have turned right earlier .
ah , right , i' m all over it .
what time' s your flight ?
hi .
did the flight for new york leave yet ?
two minutes ago .
did daniel rafferty check in ?
i' m sorry , we' re not allowed to give ...
please , please , can you just be the guy who breaks the rules , just this once ?
it' s really important .
