all my life ,
i seemed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time .
my grandpa , stanley yelnats ll , says it' s all because of this 1 50 year old curse .
now , i don' t really believe in the family curse , but when things go wrong , it kind of helps if you can blame it on something .
and for me , things went wrong a lot .
oh , jeez !
oh !
grandpa says our destiny is sealed .
could a pair of shoes falling from the sky really be part of my destiny ?
come here , boy !
hold it right there !
did you steal those shoes ?
officer , i didn' t do anything .
what' s your name , boy ?
i' m stanley .
stanley yelnats lv .

i' m glad you' re here .
this whole floor smells like stinky feet .
what did you do to my stanley ?
don' t freak out .
it' s a bruise .

could i just smell your shoe ?
how about if you take your shoe off , and i' il just
check the bedroom .

this warrant isn' t warranted !
this will never hold up in court !

how do you know that' s not mine ?
which bed is yours ?
you don' t have to answer that .
we have the right to remain silent .
oh , wouldn' t that be nice .
i sleep here .
it' s all because of your no good , dirty rotten , pig stealing great great grandfather .
there is no curse on this family .
there is on the men in this family .  " lf only , if only , "
the woodpecker sighs   please don' t sing that song .  " the bark on the tree was as soft as the skies "
please don' t sing that song , not at my table !
ma , relax .
i don' t believe in the curse , anyways .
we' re gonna need a damn good lawyer .

hey , yo , new kid .
hey , yo .
see , you didn' t dig today .
so , uh , you wouldn' t mind giving up your bread to somebody who did , now , would you ?
no , you can have it .
so , what' d they get you for ?
stealing a pair of shoes .
from the store , or were they still on someone' s feet ?
no , no , he just killed the dude first .
you just left out that little detail , right ?
they were clyde livingston' s shoes .
sweetfeet ?
what ?
man , you did not steal no clyde livingston' s sweetfeet shoes .
his world series cleats .
hold on , hold on .
how did you get ' em ?
he' s , like , the fastest guy in the majors , right ?
only guy to hit four triples in one game .
clyde livingston donated his shoes to this . . . homeless shelter .
did they have red x' s on ' em ?
what' d he just say ?
huh ?
you got zero to talk .
hey , yo , what else can you do , zero ?
yeah .
yeah , they did .
tell us a little something of your background . . .
mr. livingston .
besides the fact that it was your donated shoes that were stolen , what other connection might you have with this case ?
well , i was an orphan .
i grew up in that home .
i don' t understand what type of person steals from homeless children .
you' re no fan of mine .
it was all because of your no good , dirty rotten , pig stealing great great grandfather .
that' s who sealed our destiny .
why do you think none of his inventions work ?
pa .
i learn from failure .
doesn' t matter how smart you are .
you need luck something we ain' t got .
yeah , what about your father , the first stanley yelnats ?
he wasn' t so unlucky .
you told me he made a fortune in the stock market .
some luck .
yeah , he lost everything .
he was robbed by kissin ' kate barlow .
get on up outta there !
gimme your loot !
are you kidding me ?
she kiss him ?
oh , no .
she only kissed the men she killed .
what you got down there , huh ?
pass it up !
come on !
she left him stranded in the desert .
come on , boys !
let' s ride !
no water , no food for 1 6 days .
lf she' d have kissed him , she' d have killed him .
you' d have never been born .
smiling faces !
smiling faces !
the early mole digs the deepest hole .
shovels on the left , tortillas on the right .
let' s go !
okay , come and get it .
let' s go !
come on , magnet !
open them peepers !
let' s go !
let' s go !
head' s still on the pillow !
this ain' t no dreamland .
it' s reality .
let' s go , hotshots !
step up and get your . . .
hey , man , you picked up x ray' s shovel .
it' s shorter than the rest of them .
smaller shovel , smaller hole .
this isn' t a girl scout camp .  let' s go down
nobody' s gonna babysit you .  let' s go down
dig here .  oh , sinners , let' s go down
now , if you find anything interesting ,
you are to report it to me or pendanski .
lf the warden likes what you find , you get the rest of the day off .
what am i supposed to be looking for , mr. sir ?
you' re not looking for anything .
you' re building character .
you take a bad boy , make him dig holes all day , and it turns him into a good boy .
that' s our philosophy here at camp green lake .
start digging .  show me the way   good lord , show me the way
one down , 1 0 million to go .  show me the way   good lord , show me the way
oh , sinners , let' s go down   let' s go down   let' s go down
excuse me , can you throw that in another pile or something ,
' cause it keeps getting in my hole .
shut up !
watch where you' re moving your dirt !
watch where you' re throwing your dirt , stanley .
it was all because of your no good , dirty rotten , pig stealing great great grandfather ,
elya yelnats .
it started in a little village in latvia .
he was shoveling in morris menke' s barn , when myra , his beautiful daughter , walked by .
and that was it .
so what does your great great grandfather do ?
he goes to a fortune teller , madame zeroni , for advice .
all you think about is myra menke .
i know .
that' s when our troubles began .
listen to madame zeroni .
you should go to america .
that' s where my son is .
that' s your future , not myra menke .
her head' s as empty as a flowerpot .
mr. menke . . .
i would like your permission to marry your daughter .
you too ?
lgor barkov has offered his fattest pig for her .
what do you got ?
a heart full of love .
he' s just a boy !
i' d rather have a fat pig .
morris menke is a schmuck .
okay , here' s what you do .
take the little one .
but this solves nothing .
so it will grow .
every day , you carry the pig up the mountain .
make it drink the water from the stream while you sing . . .  " lf only , if only , " the woodpecker sighs
woodpecker sighs .  " the bark on the tree was as soft as the skies "   while the wolf waits below , hungry and lonely   he cries to the moon , " lf only , if only "
every day , the pig will get fatter , and you will get stronger .
now , after you give the pig to menke , you must carry madame zeroni up the mountain and sing while i drink so i can get strong , too .
but if you forget to come back for madame zeroni , you and your family will be cursed for always and eternity .
get your water , dog .
oh , my god .
here comes the water truck .
first hole' s the hardest .
let' s go !
hey , mr. sir .
what you doin ' , man ?
get your place in line , magnet !
keep your hands off of me , man !
so , how' d it go your first day , yelnats ?
got some blisters on you ?
big , fat blisters .
yeah .
well , don' t worry .
everything turns to callus eventually .
that' s life .
next .
myra , who do you choose
lgor barkov or elya yelnats ?
you want me to decide ?
that' s right , my blossom .
gee , i don' t know .
which pig weighs more ?
they are the same .
oh , i know !
i will think of a number between 1 and 1 0 .
okay , i' m ready .
marry lgor .
you can keep my pig as wedding present .
two pigs for one daughter !
you done already ?
don' t you know , man ?
he' s , like , the fastest digger in the camp .
he' s a mole .
i think he eats the dirt .
he' s a weird dude .
moles don' t eat dirt .
worms eat dirt , dog .
so that was it .
he took madame zeroni' s advice and went to america , like her son , but the dummy forgot to go back and carry madame zeroni up the mountain .
madame zeronl : lf you forget to come back for madame zeroni , you and your family will be cursed for always and eternity .
somebody help me !
anybody up there ? !
i' m done with my hole now !
oh , god .
oh , god .
don' t move .
oh , f
aah !
get your stuff .
get yourself a good sleep , son .
yes , sir .
yeah .
oh , my god !
what color was its blood ?
i don' t know .
i couldn' t tell .
i wish i' d have seen it .
bam !
lf mr. sir didn' t shoot it . . .
stanley , you' d be in a hole .
did you know that each one' s got exactly 1 1 spots ?
yeah , man , but if you ever get close enough to count ' em . . .
look , it' s the lizards we' re working for , man .
we build their houses for ' em .
i mean , yesterday , i saw like 1 0 of them in one hole .
man , we ain' t diggin ' for no lizards .
what we diggin ' for ?
like mr. sir said , we' re diggin ' to build some character .
come on !
wake up , buddy !  feelin ' mighty fine
dear mom . . .  feelin ' mighty fine
i' m having a wonderful time at camp .
the food' s great .
not as good as yours , of course , but i like it . "  feelin ' mighty fine at this time
we' ve been out on the lake all day .

i' ve made lots of friends .
oh , you' re goin ' to hell for sure .
