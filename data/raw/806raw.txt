look .
what the fuck , man ?
come on !
i' m disappointed in you .
here it is , the end of our freshman year and you screwed one girl .
one .
you' re a disgrace to men everywhere .
look at the stifmeister .
i got laid 23 times this year , and i' m not counting the hummer i got in the library stacks , baby .
all right , here' s a new idea for you , stifler , okay ?
you find a girl .
you two become best friends .
you don' t bother counting how many times you have sex with each other .
you just laugh at the people that do count .
here' s a new idea for you .
i' il get you a spoon so you can eat my ass .
yes !
i' m never even gonna think about political science again .
hey .
how' d you do ?
oh , fine .
yeah ?
i can' t believe i' m doing this summer abroad thing .
last thing i need is more classes .
you' re gonna have a great time .
hello , summer !
did that exam blow or what ?
yeah , it sucked .
ozzy !
kev , what' s up , man ?
how are you ?
good .
put your party hat on .
we got 12 weeks of immortality ahead .
yes , sir !
weird .
ah , the one that got away , huh , son ?
yeah .
yeah .
well , evidently you two made quite the handsome couple on the internet .
oh , i didn' t see it .
it , uh , was brought up at a p. t. a. meeting .
anyway , my point is , these little sexual debacles should not get you down , because you know what ?
it happens to the best of us .
in fact , the first time your mother and i ... got together ,
i used a condom .
well , she referred to it as " shrink wrapping .
but i got over it .
anyway , keep your chin up .
you keep plugging ... and , uh , good things will happen .
good to have you home , son .
it' s good to be home , dad .
did you get through ' em ?
there' s the mystery man !
finch , how are you ?
kevin .
konichiwa .
james .
konichiwa .
konichiwa .
it' s japanese .
it means " hello .
hello .
finch , what happened to latin ?
i met a japanese girl at the art museum .

oh , and the guggenheim with francesca .
the guggenheim ?
and then my social psych professor in baskin robbins .

stifler' s mom .
stifler' s mom is a goddess .

we can' t party anywhere anymore .
and things are
getting weird ?
yeah , a little bit .
first summer back from college .
yep , things are gonna get weirder .
what are you talking about ?
well , times change , people change .
it' s just what happens , you know .
kev , listen .
go into my old room .
my friends and i knew that it was up to us to stick together .
you remember my first college summer ?
we rented that lake house in grand harbor .
we treated everyday out there like it was a post prom party .
hell of a time .
we capped it all off with a massive blowout .
best ever .
it was legendary .
my advice is do that .
by the end of the summer , you' re gonna see the big picture .
# i love adventure nothing' s better to me ##
she' s on the phone .
she' s on the phone .
it' s long distance .
who ?
nadia !
nadia !
what ?
new york .
she' s on hello .
yes , dear , he' s right here .
here .
wait .
now remember
yes , i am sure to go see the lion king .
right .
and don' t ride the subway after midnight .
okay .
i know they' ve done wonderful things with that city , but , you know , for me
dad !
he' s right hang on .
hey hey , nadia .
jim !
how was college ?
college was excellent .
yeah .
yeah , it was it was really excellent .
you have not forgotten about me , have you ?
no .
i , uh absolutely not .
i definitely didn' t .
good , because guess what ?
i' m coming to see you at the end of summer .
i hope you' re ready for me ... because i have not forgotten about you either , you sexy boy .
shit .
jim , you can eat hot dogs tomorrow .
no , no , finch , it' s not the hot dogs .
nadia called me this morning .
she' s coming here at the end of the summer and she wants to see me .
oh , that' s killer .
yeah , that' s a good thing .
no , not " good thing .
not " killer .
i' il never be able to do it .
nadia is gonna be expecting filet mignon .
okay , and all i' m gonna be able to give her ... is rump roast .
aw , come on .
jim , you' ve had experience since nadia .
ah , yes , you would be referring to ... the flute fetish band geek that made me her bitch and then ditched me after prom .
yes , that' s great experience .
that' s the one .
ah , you just gotta find the right girl , jimbo .
brings it all together .
i had the right woman .
she just sells her cottage and takes off to parts unknown .
oh , my romantic life has past its peak .
take me out to the pasture and shoot me .
super start to a super summer , fellas .
welcome home .
guys , i got it .
pack your bags .
for what ?
we' re moving to the lake .
we' re gonna be the shit .
everybody on the beach is gonna know us .
plenty of opportunities to practice for nadia .
throw a huge party at the end of the summer to cap it all off .
dude , that' s a great idea .
that way we' il be able to welcome heather back ... and we' il be able to prepare for nadia' s big arrival .
this is it .
this is my summer of love .
just thought i' d say good bye to you animals .
hey , mr. levenstein .
how are you , sir ?
hey .
all packed up i see .
yeah , we' re all set , dad .
don' t worry , okay ?
i' il be fine .
come on and give your old man a hug .
keep it real , homies .
you too , sir .
have a good summer .
all right , let' s go .
i' ve been running these numbers here and i don' t think the four of us can afford this place .
not on summer jobs .
well , i kind of thought of that .
so ...
i invited someone else .
so ...
i invited someone else .
oh , yeah !
the stifmeister' s coming back to grand harbor !
deck the halls !
bye bye , great falls !
wipe my ass and lick my balls !
it' s stifler time , baby !
whoo hoo hoo !
whoo hoo hoo !
stifler , if you' re gonna be living with us you gotta behave yourself .
all right , you and finch just stay out of each other' s way .
kevin , stifler' s stench is unavoidable .
finch , fist yourself .
that' s right , baby .
we' re here .
yeah , baby , we' re here !
whoo hoo hoo !
it' s a palace .
it' s a temple .
isn' t this great ?
ah , dude .
are you kidding me ?
this just won' t do .
guys .
check this out .
this is it .
will you idiots tell me what this fucker' s doing ?
don' t touch me while i' m tantric .
tantric " ?
what the fuck is tantric ?
it' s a buddhist discipline .
you learn to channel your body' s energies your chakras .
when you can do that , you can have sex for hours , even days .
and this stuff' s for real ?
it' s been around for centuries .
with tantra you can make an entire session of sex ... feel like one giant orgasm .
eventually , you can sustain that feeling by meditating .
well , maybe you can teach me sometime ?
very doubtful .
true .
come on , jim .
you can' t possibly be that bad .
oh , no ?
no way .
well , i guess there' s only one person that really knows for sure , huh ?
oh , yeah ?
where' s she this summer ?
hey , are you here for the mid session performance ?
guests go in the amphitheater .
you can' t be here .
do you know where i could find michelle flaherty ?
guests bring food .
food attracts animals .
this one time , a bear came , and then the bear had to be destroyed , which means they shot it in the head with a rifle and killed it and it died .
you must know michelle .
one , two , three , four . ##
one , two , three , four .
one , two , three , four . ##
that' s a lot of flutes .
good luck .
thanks .
good job .
ha ve fun at your next class .
hey , michelle .
jim .
holy potatoes !

everybody stick together .
oh , shoot !
we' re we' re not supposed to have visitors ,
oh , shoot !
we' re we' re not supposed to have visitors ,
' cause this one time , uh ... here , this kid had these cookies this kid had these cookies
let me guess .
a bear came .
cool .
it' s like you know all our stories .
oh .
was that a question ?
i don' t know .
maybe .
do you wanna answer it anyway ?
michelle , um ,
i left you like , uh like three messages after prom .
really ?
you didn' t think i was weird because of the way i acted that night ?
weird , no .
surprising , yes .
i get nasty when i' m horny .
that' s kind of why i' m here .
um , you remember , was i any good ... that that night ?
oh , wow .
geez .
how could i forget ?
you sucked .
you didn' t know what the hell you were doing .
but wasn' t it fun even though you were so terrible ?

i' m very angry right now .
you can tell by the tone of my voice i' m angry .
i' m pissed off is what i am .
here they are .
cut ' em off .
go , go .
wait a minute .
are you petey ?
petey ?
uh , yeah , sure .
petey !
well , that explains everything .
all right .
well , it' s always something with these kids .
go !
petey , we are just so thrilled to have you .
none of my kids are at your caliber .
watch that .
but we are just so overjoyed to have someone with your kind of talent here .
oh , great .
here you go .
that' s great .
oh , look at this .
your old best friend .

i' il tell you something .
i' m about fed up with these tall oaks north kids .

you are so sweet .
he is ... special .
he' s my bitch .
he' s my bitch .
well , michelle has confirmed it .
i suck .
what ?
i gotta get some practice .
don' t worry about it .
i mean , that' s why we got the house , jimbo .
we plop a keg on the deck , and the girls come in off the beach .
it' s like a hummingbird feeder .
you think so ?
i know so .
guaranteed hotties .
fellas , nice pad .
good view , but ... the sherminator sensors detect no female life forms in the vicinity .
high likelihood of a sausage fest in progress .
the girls are coming .
i made some calls .
yeah .
the sherminator' s got a point , kev .
since when do you start listening to the sherminator ?
since he made me realize there' s an abundance of wiener here .
i mean , look around , dude .
dude ?
all right , now it' s your turn .
oh , come on .
there' s nothing to tell .
hey , what' s up ?
what are you guys talking about ?
you know , we' re just trading war stories about college who hooked up with who , who slept with who
so , vicky ?
well , there was this one guy .
how ' bout you ?
oh , you know , there was a few girls three .
ooh , look at you .
you stud .
all right , oz .
now that kevin told us , what about you ?
you haven' t had the slightest bit of attraction to any girl at school ?
don' t you fucking say no .
i know you did .
even if i did , it wouldn' t be anything more than just a momentary thing .
very ... uninteresting .
and how about you , jessica ?
how many chicks did you sleep with this year ?
gee , wouldn' t you like to know .
fuck yeah , i would .
come on , ozzy .
yeah , man .
ball .
pool' s yours .
come on , ozzy .
yeah , man .
ball .
pool' s yours .
hey , vic , you wanna play ?
yeah , sure .
you wanna break ?
what the
where are the fucking females ?
jim , can' t you leave your shirt on ?
you' re scaring the chicks away .
jim , can' t you leave your shirt on ?
you' re scaring the chicks away .
dude , give him a break .
ozzy , go deep .
yeah , bro .
you playing ?
no .
no , no , keep going .
flag pattern .
what are you doing ?
fishing .
are you okay ?
you okay ?
oh , man , i' m so sorry .
is everybody okay ?
amazing .
yes .
amazing .
yes .
the force is strong in that one .
whoa .
the sherminator detects serious heat at a distance of two meters .
prepare to deploy beer .
sherman .
dude ,
let me give you a valuable piece of advice , okay ?
drop the whole " sherminator " thing .
please repeat previous statement .
look , i know your last name is sherman , right ?
and that rhymes with the terminator which was a big hit movie , ten years ago .
but you can' t tell me a girl' s ever really gone for it .
system overload .
hasta la vista , jessica .
what a freak .
vic , hey , you guys are leaving ?
you know , we barely had a chance to hang out , you know , catch up .
well , what are you doing this weekend ?
i can get together .
cool .
let' s hang out .
all right .
bye , kev .
see ya , jess .
no , no , that' s all wrong .
thank you .
have a nice day .
good bye .
so what does he mean , " meet up " ?
you know , like hang out , grab lunch , whatever .
i told you , we' re just friends now .
and he totally understands .
oh , yeah , i' m sure he understands quite well .
he does .
oh , no , sir .
these are all wrong for you .
i mean , seriously .
sure .
well , we' re friends .
but it' s not like i see her making plans with anyone else .
right .
i don' t see her with a boyfriend .
i think that puts me on deck .
hey , vicky only slept with one guy since we went out .
i mean , that like makes me 50 % of her entire guy related life .
you dipshit .
she didn' t sleep with one guy .
she slept with at least three .
what ?
when a girl tells you how many guys she slept with , multiply it by three and that' s the real number .
didn' t you fuckers learn anything at college ?
kevin meyers did not sleep with three girls at michigan .
but why would he lie to me ?
it' s not a lie .
it' s an adjustment .
the rule of three .
but why would he lie to me ?
it' s not a lie .
it' s an adjustment .
the rule of three .
the rule of what ?
three .
a guy tells you how many girls he' s hooked up with , it' s not even close to that .
take that number and divide it by three .
then you get the real total .
so , if kevin' s saying it' s been three girls , it' s more like one , or none .
none ?
rule of three .
it' s an exact science , consistent as gravity .
oh , my god !
guys !
check it out .
lesbians .
lesbians live here .
you know , mr. homophobic wizard , that it is possible for women to hold hands and not be gay .
friends can hold hands .
hey , finch , i don' t wanna hear about you and your boyfriends .
go jerk off .
unnecessary .
tantra teaches you to hold an orgasm over time ... in anticipation of an ultimate moment ... to release it upon the world .
i' m filling up to the brim .
that' s fucking disgusting !
oh , i' m gonna throw up .
hello ?
hey , heather .
you' re in !
oz !

and obviously , nadia won' t expect you to hop in the sack .
and then we break up the day of the party .
and you' re all healed and back on the market .
you' re evil .

i' m like cupid .
and i know how to make a girl jealous .
this is gonna be fun .

i' m fine .
i might have to ... actually go through with this .
jim , what' s the big deal with nadia , anyway ?
i mean , okay , so she' s 50, 000 times hotter ... than most girls , but ... come on , it' s just sex .
oh , no .
you saw the thing on the internet .
did it look like i might have had ... a slight interest in nadia then ?
add another year to that .
okay .
hey , why don' t you bring nadia to the concert first ?
it' il be a cool date .
we' il see how things go .
michelle , you have been great .
thank you .
anytime .
come on .
you ready to break up ?
you big , stupid dummy !
theater is so cool !
i don' t care if you are the best lay i' ve ever had in my life .
i hate your guts anyway .
don' t say that .
and i don' t care if you did give me ten orgasms in a row , because you smell really bad .
no !
i smell really bad !
because we' ve been having so much sex , and and i haven' t showered , and i wanna shower !
so , don' t you go being all super sexy guy anymore , because i am now impervious ... to your unrelenting machismo and sexual ardor .
and that includes fucking me in the ass !
so there !
we had something special .
hey , what' s up , dog ?
what' s up , dog ?
vicky .
hey .
hey .
i' m so glad you came .
you want something to drink or hey .
can i help you ?
kevin .
that' s my date .
what ?
you you saved them all .
how sweet .
you don' t think i' m a dork ?
whatever you are , jim , it is what i like .
kevin left .
didn' t look good .
kevin left ?
just wandered down the beach .
you okay , kev ?
wanna tell us what' s up ?
wanna feel finch' s ass ?
no , i i went to say hi to vicky , and she was there with a date .
you hooked up with three girls this year .
you' re doing fine .
rule of three , oz .
i guess i was living in the past wanting to party with you guys ... and be with vicky , it' s just like high school .
you remember that day after prom ?
you know , we made a toast to the next step .
i guess i never took it .
my brother said that by the end of the summer i' d see the big picture .
and i see it .
no matter what , times change and things are different .
the problem is , i don' t want them to be .
you know , kevin , i haven' t moved on either .
i' ve been obsessed with the one woman i can' t have a real future with , other than a very kinky , extremely warped one .
i gotta find a new goddess .
it' s gonna take patience , but i' ve been celibate all summer .
yeah , you kinda get used to it , though , huh ?
are you insane ?
hey , look , kev , different does not necessarily mean worse .
as a matter of fact , i think things are just getting better .
or am i gonna have to drag your ass back to that party and prove it to you ?
i' il walk .
wow !
you know , you have beautiful eyes .
oh , you' re sweet .
that' s a really nice top .
oh .

i think you better  your loss .
wow .
you know , you have beautiful eyes .
come here , dude .
come on .
you' re making an ass out of yourself .
you' re ruining my mojo .
and you' re not the stifmeister , okay ?
it takes years to develop true stifmeister style .
come on , man !
i just wanna see some boobs .
hey , pop tart .
dream on , midget .
excuse him .
come here .
take this .
you' re on cop watch .
go out in the driveway .

steve all right .
gentlemen , uh , this appears to be a party .
guys , if you' il excuse me , i' m gonna go look for nadia .
good luck .
ahh .
so what was this year like for you ?
did you miss high school ?

actually , that is quite difficult .
how do you mean ?
well , this one time at band camp ,
i
holy shit .
what ?
tell me .
uh , well , uh , this one time at band camp ,
i got stuck playing this trombone .
and i can' t play anything at all .
so i totally sucked .
and everyone thought i was this petey guy , but i didn' t know what to think , so i just kept playing and playing , and i didn' t know what i was doing .
it was so funny !
i gotta go .
what ?
why ?
nadia , please don' t take this the wrong way , but , but you' re you' re everything that i used to want .
and as much as i may really , really regret what i' m about to do , there' s somebody else i want to be with .
you you want the band geek ?
nadia , i am a band geek .
i just never joined the band .
i just never joined the band .
you go get your geek .
someday i will find mine .
hey , um , kevin meyers .
hi .
sorry i was a dick before .
it' s okay , man .
my name' s brett .
uh , could you give us a sec ?
sure .
look , you don' t have to do this .
maybe i was being selfish ... in wanting to be your friend .
maybe it' s just not gonna work .
victoria ,
i would much rather have you as a friend than not have you in my life at all .
whoo hoo hoo !
whoo !
whoo hoo hoo !
