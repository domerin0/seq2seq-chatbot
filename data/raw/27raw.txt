what is it that makes a man a man ?
is it his origins , the way things start ?
or is it something else , something harder to describe ?
for me , it all began in 1944 .
classified mission off the coast of scotland .
the nazis were desperate .
combining science and black magic ... ... they intended to upset the balance of the war .
i was 28 , already a paranormal advisor to president roosevelt .
i could never have suspected that what would transpire that night ... ... would not only affect the course of history ... ... but change my life forever .
all right , men , let' s go .
move !
come on !
come on !
come on !
let' s fan it out .

i abhor the use of violence .

the remains of trondham abbey , built on an intersection of ley lines ... ... the boundaries between our world and the others

the seven gods of chaos !
our enemies will be destroyed !
and from the ashes ... ... a new eden will arise .

i was taking a picture .

do you understand ?
we have to stop them .
go !

the portal' s been open for too long .
something may have come through .

spread out over that way !
sir !
something up here !
he' s gone .
for now .
when you said something came through ...
from where ?
i don' t see them !
do you really , really believe in hell ?
there is a place , a dark place ... ... where ancient evil slumbers and waits to return .
grigori gave us a glance tonight .
grigori ?
that' s russian , right ?
grigori efimovich rasputin .
rasputin ?
come on !
occult adviser to the romanovs .
in 1916 , at a dinner in his honor ... ... he was poisoned , shot , stabbed , clubbed ... ... castrated and finally drowned .
and yet , we saw him here tonight .
professor broom .

what the hell is that ?
an ape ?
no .
it was red .
bright red .
lower your light , you' re scaring it .
what are you two shooting at ?

move to the left .
there we were , an unready father for an unwanted child .
the boys gave him a name that very night .
in retrospect , perhaps not the most fortunate .
but nevertheless , a name we all came to use .
we called him hellboy .
look at the birdie .
speculation about the origins ...
evidence that hellboy ...
so , what is it exactly that you say this agency does ?
i kid you not .
it hunts monsters .
the claim , of course , that this creature ... ... works for the fbl as a monster hunter .
what you seek is in there .
this is a sacred place .
give me my gold .
we shouldn' t be here .
master .
have you told him yet ?
no .
we should .
i' il notify his family .
he has no family .
according to this file , he does .
he has a son .
hurry up !
hurry up !
wait right here !
tom manning is the head of special operations at the fbl .
he joins pat in the studio tonight to go over the latest hellboy sighting .
there .
that' s the tail .
and these are the horns .
i have a question .
in the pictures of aliens , ufo , the yeti , hellboy ... ... why is it they' re always out of focus ?
why don' t you tell us ... ... about the bureau of paranormal research and defense ?

in the absence of light , darkness prevails .
there are things that go bump in the night , agent myers .
make no mistake about that .
and we are the ones who bump back .
1937 , hitler joins the thule society ... ... a group of german aristocrats obsessed with the occult .
1938 , he acquired the spear of longinus ... ... which pierced the side of christ .
he who holds it becomes invincible .
hitler' s power increases tenfold .
1943 , president roosevelt decides to fight back .
the bureau of paranormal research and defense is born .
1958 , the occult wars finally come to an end ... ... with the death of adolf hitler .

big baby .
how long was it latched onto you ?
i don' t know .
about five seconds .
professor , look .
is it bad ?
touched you five seconds , laid three eggs .
didn' t even buy me a drink .
the stinger detaches itself from the tongue and injects the eggs .
they are very sensitive to heat and light .
they need a humid , dark environment to breed .
did you ever lose track of him ?
well , let' s see .
there was that moment when i had the train on top of my head .
we can' t risk it .
tomorrow you' il go back to the tracks with a group of agents .
search the whole place top to bottom .
find those eggs and destroy them .
elizabeth sherman .
i don' t like the term " fire starter .
i just don' t .
and " pyrokinesis " sounds like some psychosis or something .
i don' t know .
maybe that' s right .
not being able to let go .
it' s scary .
i black out after each episode .
sometimes for hours .
you hear about so and so ... ... who just lost control and just exploded .
well , they' re lucky it isn' t true .
with me , it is .
my master is calling your name now , my girl .

it' s her choice .
professor , the girl you' re
professor , that girl you' re talking about ...
hey , boy scout ... ... think twice .
no , listen , i read her file .
" read her file . " she blames herself ... ... for that explosion in pittsburgh .
look , i think i can help .
i could talk to her .
i think i could bring her back .
just what was it that landed you this job pushing " pamcakes , " huh ?
what was it ?
punctuality ?
the way you part your hair ?
what is your area of expertise ?
he doesn' t want me with him .
i know that much .
you' re doing fine .
no , i' m not .
look , he respects clay , not me .
i' m really sorry , okay ?
i' m not your guy .
i' m dying , agent myers .
like any father , i worry about him .
in medieval stories , there is often a young knight ... ... who is inexperienced ...
... but pure of heart .
come on .
look , i am not pure of heart .
yes , you are .
rasputin is back for him .
what i ask of you ... ... is to have the courage to stand by him when i am gone .
he was born a demon .
can' t change that .
but you will help him ... ... in essence ... ... to become a man .
pull that down .
she was making great progress ... ... and now this .
we' il be closed for months .
and it put a big dent in our thorazine supply .
she' s been like this since it happened .
are you sure you want to go in ?
miss sherman ?
i' m agent myers , fbl .

it' s a beautiful name .
sixty percent of all the women in the world are named liz .
well , it' s impressive by my standards .
my name' s john .
john t. myers .
dr. broom asked me to invite you back to the bureau .
no special precautions , no security escorts .
just you and me in a taxi like regular folks .
over here .
you said those eggs need it dark and humid ?
well , they hit the jackpot .
the subway lines , they all converge right around here .
right below us is the old vandeveer reservoir .
it was abandoned in the mid 30s .
there' s a pulse .
there .
a cistern on the other side .
most of the eggs are there .
there' s no way in .
we should go back and request a special permit , type 2
you guys coming or what ?
we lead a charmed life .
here you are , doctor .
this should cover your tail fin .
reliquary .
straight from the vatican .
a bone from st. dionysius .

the scraps of paper ... ... liz' s sudden relapse and return .
bread crumbs on the trail .
like in a fable .
they both distract him ... ... and guide him exactly where i need him .
moscow .
his destiny .
and the last clue ... ... will be left by the late professor broom .
you raised the child .
nurtured him .
so in return ... ... i will permit you ... ... a brief , brief glimpse of the future .
he will open the portal ... ... and bring about the end of the world .
if only you had had him destroyed 60 years ago ... ... none of this would have come to pass .
but then , how could you have known ?
your god chooses to remain silent .
mine lives within me .
every time i died and crossed over ... ... a little more of the master ... ... came back with me .
he disclosed to me the child' s true name .
would you like to know it ?
i know what to call him .
i call him ... ... son .
i' m ready .
it' il be quick .
just go there and tell her how you feel .
my mom says that ...
look , it' s not ...
it' s not that easy , okay ?
plus , you' re 9 .
you' re not old enough to be giving me advice .
all right , stand by .
who are those guys ?
liz , i' m sorry .
it' s broom .
let' s go .
we need to find him .
no !
wait , what happened ?
no !
it' s okay .
no , not him .
would you take her ?
something' s wrong .
he hasn' t spoken to anybody in three days .
not a word .
he won' t eat , he won' t sleep .
i' ve never seen him like this .
never .
should i stay ?
with him , i mean ?
listen , i' m not much of a problem solver .
three decades , i' ve only completed two sides .
but i do know this much .
if there' s trouble ... ... all us freaks have is each other .
and i' m stuck here .
so ... ... take care of the big monkey for me , will you ?
volokolamsk fields , 50 miles from moscow , that' s where we' re going .
sebastian plackba , number 16 .
that' s the only clue we have .
we' ve collected and destroyed thousands of eggs ... ... but we have no trace of this sammael or this rasputin character .
we leave as soon as we get clearance and equipment .
hellboy' s coming .
i' m not pleased about that , but i' il be in charge this time .
we either wrap this up or i' m closing this freak show for good .
hi .
hi .
i' il ... ... come to moscow ... ... if you' re still going .
i am .
but i have something to say .
i understand what you don' t like about me .
i do .
what i am ... ... makes you feel a little out of place ... ... out there .
red , i don' t ...
listen .
i' m not like myers .
he makes you feel like you belong ... ... which is good , really .
i wish i could do something about this .
i can' t .
one , i' il always look this good .
and two ... ... l' il never give up on you .
ever .
i like that .
one falls , two shall arise .
sammael .
we' il have to nail them all at once , and the eggs .
and when we do , no mumbo jumbo .
double core vulcan 65 grenades .
we' ve installed a handy little timer .
you set it , you walk away .
cable pulls the safety pins .
kaboom .
easy to clean , easy to use .
sparky to big red .
do you read me ?
come in .
sparky " ?
who came up with that ?
myers ?
yeah , we' re leaving the main road , so hang on .
this better be the place or i' il puke .
you better come out and see .
sebastian plackba , number 16 .
forget it .
we' re never gonna find rasputin' s mausoleum .
now , what we do here is we make up a grid .
we go in by quadrants .
maybe satellite photography .
let me ask for directions .
what' d he say ?
come on , baby , find me a talker .
hi there .
come on .
come on .
come on .
what do you want ?
this is ridiculous .
i run this show , not him .
this guy' s nothing but trouble .
anybody got a powerbar ?
hey , there he is .
sixty feet further , comrades .
and three rows in .
what the hell is that on his back ?
this here is lvan klimentovich .
say " hi , " lvan .

gotcha .
ivan says there' s a whole network of tunnels down here .
goes on for miles .
stay close , everybody .
you better be right about this .
we' il be all right as long as we don' t separate .
hey , sparky .
tell everyone to turn their locator belts on .
anybody sees anything ...
i' il say " marco .
polo .
are you sure about this ?
two .
don' t worry , boy scout , she' il take care of you .
she' s a tough one .
come on .
ask your buddy how far this thing goes .
how you doing up there , lvan ?
if i had legs i' d kick your ass !
would you mind holding this guy for a while ?
he is so negative .
what the hell is that ?
something big .
lime , come with me .
right .
no , no , no .
stay put !
stop !
you listen to me .
listen to me !
i' m in charge .
we' re gonna go back .

whatever it is , it' s coming for us .
now , we gotta move forward !
lime , let' s go !
stay put !
and you !
i am not afraid of you !
i' m in charge !
we go back !
i was better off dead !
oh , crap .
music .
really went deep .
hey , what' s wrong with you ? !
you killed my father .
your ass is mine .
what are you laughing at , you nazi son of a ... ?
don' t even think about it .
that' s all for you , pinhead .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
having a ...
you never light a cigar that way .
you use a wooden match .
preserves the flavor .
you see ?
thank you .
thank you .
so he thinks you and i ...
that' s why he' s mad at me .
but it' s not true , right ?
what ?
well , that , you know , you feel that way about me .
you want to know that here ?
now ?
yeah .
red , white , whatever .
guys are all the same .
hey , wait up .
have you found them yet ?
i got them right below me .
it' s a matter of minutes .
okay , good .
could you hurry up ?
because it' s a little spooky in here .
liz , wait .
oh , my god .
let' s back out real slow .
let' s back out real slow .
myers , ready your grenades .
marco .
marco .
marco .
get your big , red butt over here .
i' m coming for you , kid !
no piggybacks !
get off me , you ...
liz , no !
they' re gonna kill him !
do something !
what do you want me to do ?
hit me .
what ?
hit me .
now !
you should be running .
they are all here .
all of them .
just the way it was promised .
this one' s awake .
thank you for this .
and i looked ... ... and beheld an angel .
and in his right hand , the key to the bottomless pit .
these were the words i heard as a peasant boy in tobolsk .
and now , the door .
sent by the ogdru jahad ... ... so that they might at long last enter our world .
you are the key , the right hand of doom .
your stone hand .
what did you think it was made for ?
open the locks .
don' t do it , red !
don' t do it !
silence .
imagine it .
an eden ... ... for you and her .
no .
no ?
in exchange for her soul , then ?
open the door .
no .
as you wish .
no !
liz !
her soul awaits on the other side .
if you want her back ... ... open the door and claim her .
your true name is inscribed around the locks that hold you .
you cannot break them ... ... no matter how strong you are .
the eclipse has begun .
your true name ... ... say it !
become the key .
for her .
anung un rama .
repeat it .
anung un rama .
open the final lock .
remember who you are !
believe me , i have lived long enough to know ... ... not a tear will be shed for this world !
you have a choice .
your father gave you that .
no , you don' t !
open it !
do it !
what have you done ?
i chose .
you will never fulfill your destiny .
you will never understand the power inside you .
i' il just have to find a way to live with that .
child .
look what you' ve done .
you' ve killed me ... ... an insignificant man .
but you have brought forth ... ... a god .
myers , let' s go .
hell will hold no surprises for us .
i took a grenade belt .
the damn thing' s broken .
keep her safe , will you ?
whatever happens , don' t leave her alone .
i won' t .
you' re okay , myers .
stick around .
hey , red .
just pull the cable .
i didn' t get you anything .
are you going to be okay alone ?
how big can it be ?
damn !
damn .
oh , this is gonna hurt .
gonna be sore in the morning .
she' s got no pulse .
she' s not breathing .
liz ?
i was so foolish .
red .
in the dark ...
... i heard your voice .
what did you say ?
i said , " hey ... ... you on the other side ... ... let her go .
because for ...
for her i' il cross over .
and then you' il be sorry .
what makes a man a man ?
a friend of mine once wondered .
is it his origins ?
the way he comes to life ?
i don' t think so .
it' s the choices he makes .
not how he starts things ... ... but how he decides to end them .
hey , guys ?
i' m still here .
hello ?
