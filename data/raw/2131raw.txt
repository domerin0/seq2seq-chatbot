for when he' s lonely .
and when it' s nighttime .

' " now i lay me down to sleep ...
' " ... i pray the lord my soul to keep . '

' " if i should die before i wake ... '

robbie !
will you come on down out of the tree , please ?
e. buzz !
can i get a goldfish now ?
come and get it .
come and get it .
you' re overfeeding them .
tweety two and tweety three want seconds .
you know what happens when you overfeed goldfish ?
they grow up to be ... ... sharks !
good night .
mom , there' s a big storm headed this way .
you' il be asleep by the time it gets here , if you hurry .
come on .
in you go .
good night .
good night .

closet light !
my fault , my fault .

okay ?
good night , ma .
' night , mommy .
good night .
either i' m dead or i' m crazy .
well , you' re not crazy , pete .
you mean i' m dead ?
yes .
i' m ....
you mean i ....
this is for good ?
you guessed it .
sleepwalking .
nocturnal somnambulism .
you know what ?
i will bet you anything it' s genetic .
i mean , carol anne last night , and all last week , you know .
and me when i was ten .
would you deal with this for me ?
sure .
you know ....
you know , once i slept walked four blocks .
and i fell asleep in the back of this guy' s car .
he drove all the way to work before discovering me .
god , i woke up , i started screaming .
people came running from everywhere .
they called the cops .
the cops came .
they took this poor dude downtown .
my father ...
big .... ... ed .
big ed has me examined for bruises and hickeys .
you name it .
god , i was so embarrassed .
shit , steven .
what if we dig the pool and carol anne sleepwalks ... ... and she falls into it before there' s any water ?
honey , no .
have you ever dove off a three meter board , sweetheart ?
what' s three meters ?
it' s about ten feet .
let' s just dig the pool closer to the house ... ... and let the kids jump off the roof .
honey , a three meter board , it' s like an air pocket , sweetheart .
when you dive off , it' s like free falling , okay ?
you got to get your position now .
these feet are positioning .
honey ?
three meters .
your diving days are over .
we' re talking olympics , diane .
and then i can  let me see your tuck position .
then you can jackknife into the swan .
you twist , turn and ... ... splash !
honey , it' s right to the nautilus machine .
look at this , honey .
before , after .
before , after .
don' t .
i' m telling you .
i love you .
i love you !
you fool .
no , no !
god , i love it when you talk dirty .
the storm' s getting closer .
hey , partner .
hi , honey .
is everything okay ?
it' s thundering .
come on .
hop up .
i' m the wind and you' re the feather .
say good night to mom .
good night .
good night , sweetheart .
here we go .
i don' t like the tree , dad .
it' s an old tree .
it' s been around here a long time .
it was here before my company built the neighborhood .
i don' t like its arms .
it knows i live here , doesn' t it ?
it knows everything about us .
that' s why i built the house next to it .
so it could protect us .
you and carol anne and dana and your mom and me .
it' s a very wise old tree .
it looks at me .
it knows i live here .
i think the storm' s gonna pass us .
how do you know ?
' cause i can count .
you know what you do ?
when you see the lightning ... ... you count till you hear the thunder .
if you can count higher each time ... ... that means the storm' s moving away from us .
want to try it ?
okay .
get some lightning .
wait , it' s coming .
okay .
one ... ... two , three .
okay , but i bet next time ... ... you' il be able to count to at least four or five .
betcha .
daddy , it' s for you .
you tell them to take a message , sweetpea .
my dad wants to take a message .
good night .
it' s too hot .
okay .
good night , angel .
happy dreams , okay ?
good night , daddy .
one ... two ... ... three ... four .
did not !
come on .
good night , dana .
good night , dad .
get off the phone , dana .
one ... two ... ... three ... four ... ... five ....
don' t take it so serious .
i told him to put ....
if that happens , i don' t have a job .
hey !
look at this !
i love that swing .
i love you !
i love you !
i love you !
i love it !
no !
e. buzz , no .
get down .
robbie !
carol anne !
i' ve told you guys to push your chairs in when you' re done at the table .
honey , you' re gonna ruin your eyes .
this is not good for you .
what' s the matter , e. buzz ?
what are you doing ?
how is it ?
great , mrs. freeling .
okay , bluto .
give me my cup .
you sure make good coffee .
jesus !
don' t do that , honey .
you want to see mommy lying in a cigar box covered with licorice ?
did you do this ?
you guys .
i asked you not to pull the chairs out .
tv people ?
do you see them ?
do you ?
i tell you , i think you' il really enjoy this kitchen .
this is our latest development .
we call this phase 4 .
where do you live , mr. freeling ?
well , we were the first family to set up housekeeping in cuesta verde estates .
phase 1 .
we had to pass through my neighborhood to get to this one .
the area with the lived in look .
it has that , but i think in a few months ... ... you won' t be able to distinguish phase 1 from phase 3 to phase ....
you know , we have a saying around here .
the grass grows greener on every side .
that' s the way i feel .
i can' t tell one house from the other .
you know something ?
i think you' re right .
but i think our construction standards are very liberal .
i have this neighbor and he built a jacuzzi in his bedroom ... ... and it has a running aqueduct connected to a wading pool outside .
it' s built half in and half out of his living room .
that house was featured in town and country .
come on , i' il show you the den .
honey !
come here !
quick !
hurry !
before it stops again .
what about the cans ?
leave this here .
right .
they don' t make the pick ups yet .
okay , just stand right here .
okay ?
listen , i kept dana and robbie out of this ... ... but carol anne was here so she knows .
but dana would blab , and robbie , he' d be up for three weeks ...
... sleeping on your side of the bed .
no , you should sit down .
no , no .
now just stand ... okay ?
now , just be calm .
okay .
now reach back into our past when you used to have an open mind .
remember that ?
okay .
just try to use that for the next couple of minutes .
okay ?
yeah , okay .
mother didn' t cook any dinner .
we' il go to pizza hut , okay ?
okay , now ....
now just look .
just look .
just watch .
come here , sweetheart .
honey , could you move the chair out of the way and just stay down there .
come on , let' s show daddy .
i' m hungry !
don' t argue with mommy .
come on .
come on , let' s just do this once .
okay , here we go .
i want pepperoni pizza .
mommy , that burns .
i' m sorry .
the floor needs more wax .
steven , come on , you do it .
no .
come on , honey , try .
it' s like there' s this tickling , you know , right in here .
and it starts to pull you .
the tickling pulls you .
suddenly , it' s like there' s no air except that you can breathe .
and you' re getting pulled along and ....
hi , ben .
mr. tuthill .
hi .
if you' re having problems with your set ....
that' s not it .
no .
it' s nothing like that .
diane and i were just wondering ....
this will sound strange coming from me ....
i doubt that .
those mosquitoes are something else .
they' re really chowing down .
i' ve never been bothered by them .
in fact , i don' t think i' ve ever been bitten by one .
as far as i know , nobody in my family' s ever been affected by them .
a mosquito ever suck on you , son ?
i don' t know , dad .
he don' t know .
look , mr. tuthill ....
ben .
ben .
i' m really sorry .
mr. tuthill , look ....
we were just ....
what we were wondering is ....
look .
diane , my wife , and i were wondering ....
ben , something funny is going on here next door .
something ....
we were wondering if maybe you had experienced any disturbances lately .
what kind of disturbances ?
you know ... ... dishes or furniture moving around by themselves .
don' t scratch them .
you' il infect them .
just let me put this on .
okay .
don' t !
boy , did i feel like a fool .
i' m sorry , but i had to say it .
we were losing pints of blood .
we' il keep this thing in the family .
don' t scratch .
tomorrow , i' il call somebody in .
yeah ?
who , for instance ?
i looked in the yellow pages .
furniture movers , we got .
strange phenomenon , no listing .
one , 1, 000 , two , 1, 000 , three , 1, 000 ... ... four , 1, 000 , five , 1, 000 ....
honey , look ....
i' m the one who had to live with this freaky thing ... ... and nothing bad happened .
it' s like another side of nature , a side we' re not qualified to understand .
when you overreact like this , it makes what happened much too important .
no one' s going in the kitchen till i know what' s happening .
one , 1, 000 , two , 1, 000 , three , 1, 000 , four , 1, 000 ....
one , 1, 000 , two , 1, 000 , three ....
mommy !
mommy !
dad !
help me !
help me , dad !
help me !
honey , be careful !
mom !
mommy !
mom !
help me !
help me !
he' s coming !
mom !
it' s taking me in !
robbie !
it' s hurting me !
steven , hurry !
parapsychology isn' t something you master in .
there are no certificates of graduation ... ... no licenses to practice .
i am a professional psychologist ... ... but spend most of my time engaged in this ghostly hobby which makes me ... ... i suppose , the most irresponsible woman of my age that i know .
would you like a glass for that ?
no , thank you .
you know , you were very funny .
your hands were shaking about a mile a minute .
it isn' t over .
i' m absolutely terrified .
it' s all the things that we don' t understand .
i feel like the protohuman , coming out of the forest primeval ... ... and seeing the moon for the first time and throwing rocks at it .
if i got killed , would i come back as a ghost and get stuck in the house ... ... like my sister ?
your sister isn' t dead , robbie .
if i got killed , could i visit her and show her how to get back here ?
you could tie a rope around me and hold it , then somebody could come ... ... and get us and we' d go live somewhere else .
some people believe that when you die your soul goes to heaven .
when grandpa was dead , i looked at him on the hospital bed and i was watching ... ... but i didn' t see anything go up out of him .
his soul was invisible , robbie .
you couldn' t see it .
but how come grandpa isn' t on television with carol anne ?
some people believe that when people die ... ... there' s a wonderful light ... ... as bright as the sun .
but it doesn' t hurt to look into it .
all the answers to all the questions that you ever want to know ... ... are inside that light .
and when you walk to it , you become a part of it forever .
and then ... ... some people die , but they don' t know that they' ve gone .
do you think they' re still alive ?
yes .
maybe they didn' t want to die .
maybe they weren' t ready .
maybe they hadn' t lived fully yet or they' d lived a long time ... ... but they still wanted more life .
they resist going into that light ... ... however hard the light wants them .
they just hang around ... ... watch tv , watch their friends grow up ... ... feeling unhappy and jealous ... ... and those feelings are bad .
they hurt .
and then ... ... some people ... ... just get lost on the way to the light .
and they need someone to guide them to it .
so , some people get angry and throw things around , like in my bedroom ?
yes .
just like in school .
like some kids are nice to you , some kids are mean .
i got beat up once by three kids .
they took my lunch money .
maybe they got hit by a truck and are upstairs right now .
listen , partner , maybe we ought to get some shut eye , okay ?
okay .
you know what ?
when we called grandma tonight , she got really excited ... ... that you' re coming to stay with her ... ... and she' s planning all these neat things for you guys to do .
can i take e. buzz with me when we go ?
sure you can .
good night , mom .
good night , sweetie .
good night , lady .
good night , dad .
good night , rob .
i love you .
good night , carol anne .
i' m gonna go get something to eat .
okay .
thanks .
what is it ?
what is it ?
roll it back !
i think we' ve got one .
i think it recorded .
yes , it recorded !
look at all of them .
is that our house ?
who are all those people ?
they' re so lonely .
so alone .
where are they coming from ?
i don' t know .
robbie ?
call me , okay ?
this cameo is over 100 years old .
yeah , some haul .
and this watch is only a few years old .
and it' s not yours .
no .
well , i' m off .
i' m taking these back to the lab along with the tapes .
i' m gonna have to display these , you know .
please , not on 60 minutes .
or that' s incredible .
i' il get it .
excuse me .
i' m leaving ryan here with you .
marty won' t be coming back .
i am coming back .
and i' il bring some help .
try not to worry .
thank you .
we' ve missed you down at the office .
the boys have gotten worried , so ... ... i took it upon myself to
jesus , steve , you look like shit .
aren' t you feeling any better ?
i' m still weak .
i' ve got the flu .
i can' t get up and i  looks like you got some cable problems .
yeah , well , move over here .
cable' s been off for a couple months .
we' il have to look into that .
the rest of the block dark , too ?
no , it' s just us .
got some electrical problems as well here .
what have you got screwed in there ?
a 300 watt bulb ?
you afraid of burglars or you trying to attract every insect in cuesta verde ?
steve , tell me something .
are you happy here ?
yes , i am .
forgive me for asking these questions ... ... but we don' t want to lose the best rep we' ve ever had ... ... to the flu or other opportunities .
seeing all that software in your living room makes me wonder if , well ... ... maybe you got something on the side .
no , i just read popular mechanics .
i got hobbies .
feel like going for a little ride ?
i' d like to show you something .
hello ?
carol anne ?
i' m sorry !
one of your children was born in your house ?
carol anne .
i understand that she' s missed a lot of school .
one of trask' s daughters is in the same nursery class .
she caught the flu as well ?
yeah , we' ve all got the same thing .
i' m sorry .
i didn' t see her .
she' s around .
listen , i wonder if you' d mind if i asked you a question .
are you leaving cuesta verde ?
it' s hard to believe the day could be this beautiful .
how could anyone in the world have a problem on a day like this ?
how' s that spot for a bay window ?
it' s pretty nice if you' re living up here , but not so great down there in the valley ... ... looking at those homes cutting into the hillside .
you don' t have to live in the valley anymore .
what are you saying ?
we' re starting phase 5 right here where we' re standing .
all of this can be your master bedroom suite .
that can be your view .
interested ?
mr. teague , that' s a generous offer .
i' m just not a developer .
you' re responsible for 42 percent of sales .
that' s almost half of everything there ... ... almost $70 million worth of dwelling and properties .
now that' s a whole generation of security ... ... that nobody can put a price tag on .
look , i know we should have made you a full partner three years ago .
i don' t want to lose you now .
not much room for a pool , is there ?
we own all the land .
we' ve already made arrangements for relocating the cemetery .
you' re kidding .
come on .
that' s sacrilegious , isn' t it ?
don' t worry about it .
after all , it' s not an ancient tribal burial ground .
it' s just ... ... people .
besides , we' ve done it before .
when ?
in 1976 .
right down there .
cuesta verde ?
all 300 acres .
and let me tell you , it was quite a deal .
but i never heard anything about it .
it' s not something one advertises on a billboard ... ... or on the side of a bus .
what' s worrying you ?
friends and relatives can visit their loved ones in broxton memorial park .
it' s only five minutes further , for christ' s sake .
five minutes .
you know , that' s no great hardship .
i suppose that would be okay .
okay with whom ?
whomever might complain .
nobody' s complained until now .
we' ve had two experiences in the kitchen .
this is the den .
would y' all mind hanging back ?
you' re jamming my frequencies .
so , what side of the rainbow are we working tonight , dr. lesh ?
is this your knott' s berry farm solution ?
i know what you' re thinking .
but you must take my word for it .
she' s cleaned many houses .
her gifts have been documented
look , we haven' t heard carol anne since last night .
why is this door locked , mr. freeling ?
answer her , steven !
i am .
i am addressing the living .
i' m sorry .
that' s the room my son and daughter used to occupy .
we believe it' s the heart of the house .
this house has many hearts .
what is the matter ?
what' s the matter ?
i was trying to answer her with my mind and she couldn' t hear me .
didn' t you say tangina barrons was an extraordinary clairvoyant ?
i am .
i just don' t like trick answers .
come here , honey ... ... and give me your hand .
i' m not gonna bite you .
come on down here .
you' re gonna give me whiplash looking up at you .
your daughter is alive and in this house .
where was the last incident of ' " bilocation ? '
i get my strongest feeling ... ... the point of origin is in the child' s closet upstairs .
yes , i believe that , too .
now honey , you' re gonna be strong for me and for your daughter .
i can do absolutely nothing without your faith ... ... in this world and your love for the children .
i will .
believe me , i will .
and will you do anything i ask ... ... even if it comes contrary to your beliefs as a human being and a christian ?
yes , i promise .
please .
would you all come on in ?
gather round .
there is no death .
it is only a transition ... ... to a different sphere of consciousness .
carol anne is not like those she' s with .
she is a living presence ... ... in their spiritual , earthbound plane .
they' re attracted to the one thing about her ... ... that is different from themselves : her life force .
it is very strong .
it gives off its own illumination .
it is a light that implies life ... ... and memory of love and home ... ... and earthly pleasures ... ... something they desperately desire ... ... but can' t have anymore .
right now , she' s the closest thing to that ... ... and that is a terrible distraction ... ... from the real light ... ... that has finally come for them .
do you understand me ?
these souls , who , for whatever reason ... ... are not at rest ... ... are also not aware that they have passed on .
they' re not part of consciousness as we know it .
they linger in a perpetual dream state ... ... a nightmare from which they cannot awake .
inside this spectral light ... ... is salvation .
a window to the next plane .
they must pass through this membrane ... ... where friends are waiting to guide them to new destinies .
carol anne must help them cross over .
and she will only hear ... ... her mother' s voice .
now ... ... hold onto yourselves .
there' s one more thing .
a terrible presence is in there with her .
so much rage , so much betrayal .
i' ve never sensed anything like it .
i don' t know what hovers over this house ... ... but it was strong enough to punch a hole into this world ... ... and take your daughter away from you .
it keeps carol anne very close to it ... ... and away from the spectral light .
it lies to her .
it says things only a child can understand .
it has been using her to restrain the others .
to her ... ... it simply is another child .
to us ... ... it is the beast .
now let' s go get your daughter .
red ribbons ... ... handkerchiefs ... ... tennis balls .
rope' s right here .
bath water ?
i shut it off .
it' s ready , too .
all right .
call to her .
carol anne , it' s mommy .
can you hear me ?
carol anne , please tell mommy hello .
try again .
can you say hello to daddy ?
daddy and i miss you so much .
we love you so much .
please just say hello .
she' s under restraint .
what ?
who' s restraining her ?
there are many arms about her .
she thinks it' s safe .
quickly !
who is she more threatened by , you or your husband ?
neither !
steve decides the punishment .
the children know that .
that' s not fair .
i' ve never hit her .
fight later !
steven , make carol anne answer you !
carol anne ?
it' s daddy .
be cross with her .
be angry with her , or you' il never see her again .
carol anne , i want you to answer me !
tell her if she doesn' t answer you , she' il get a spanking .
come on , i' ve never spanked the children .
honey , please , just tell her .
carol anne ?
answer your parents or you' il get a real spanking from both of us !
mommy , help me !
she' s away from him .
away from whom ?
is she all right ?
diane , ask about the light .
mommy , help me , please .
carol anne ?
honey , do you see a light ?
help me , please !
mommy !
mommy , help me !
tell her to go to the light .
no !
they' il follow her like they' ve followed her for weeks .
now tell her !
you must do what i say .
it' s all right .
tell her , diane .
mommy , i can' t find you !
run to the light , carol anne !
run as fast as you can !
are you in the light ?
no .
tell her you are .
no !
it' s a lie !
you can' t choose life or death when we' re dealing with what' s in between .
tell her before it' s too late .
run to the light , baby !
mommy' s in the light !
tell her you' re waiting for her .
mommy is waiting for you in the light !
i hate you for this .
now clear your minds .
it knows what scares you .
it has from the very beginning .
don' t give it any help .
it knows too much already .
now , open the door .
ryan !
get downstairs and wait by the target !
okay !
steven !
give me the tennis ball marked number one !
dr. lesh !
it' s my handwriting !
it came right out of thin air !
the ball came back !
it' s his handwriting .
kiss my ass !
number two !
diane !
give me your hand !
she' s at the mouth of the corridor !
tell her to stop !
tell her not to go into the light !
carol anne ?
listen to me !
do not go into the light !
stop where you are !
turn away from it !
don' t even look at it !
hurry with the rope !
throw it into the light !
fantastic !
i got it !
tell him to take up the slack gently .
take up the slack !
take up the slack !
okay !
help me tie this around my waist !
what are you doing ?
i' m going in after her !
she won' t come to you !
let me go !
you' ve never done this before .
neither have you !
you' re right !
you go !
no !
no !
let me !
you can' t !
who' s strong enough to stay up here and hold the rope ?
i love you !
no !
no !
go downstairs and wait by ryan ... ... and pull only when i say so !
only when i say !
steven !
don' t let go !
never !
it' s coming .
how will we know she' s got her ?
when will we know ?
cross over , children !
all are welcome !
all welcome .
go into the light !
no !
no !
you said , ' " no ' " !
there is peace and serenity in the light .
you said don' t go into the light !
diane !
diane !
steven , not yet !
diane !
they' re here !
they' re back .
diane !
no , please , no !
get them into the water !
no , no , no .
i' m helping you .
i' il get something ....
don' t worry .
get them to the water .
she' s all right .
she' s gonna be all right .
you done good .
come on .
come on , breathe now .
just take a breath .
breathe , honey , breathe .
breathe , damn it !
breathe !
diane ... diane , breathe , breathe , breathe !
that' s it .
come on , baby .
come on .
come on , breathe !
that' s it , breathe .
baby .
sweetheart .
sweetpea , it' s daddy .

be careful .
i' m going to dinner with janice and brian .
is your room packed ?
everything but the bed .
mom ?
will we sleep here tonight ?
i guess not .
so you better get brian to bring you home right after dinner .
because dad wants us to stay at the holiday inn on i 74 .
i remember that place .
mom ?
you what ?
mom ?
are you gonna do anything about this ?
about what ?
your new gray .
mom ?
you don' t like it ?
you don' t think it' s kind of punk ?
mom ?
' bye , mom .
okay , rob .
that thing almost killed me .
you okay ?
don' t hurt your back .
fine .
