it' s hard to remember now , but europe was like this in 1944 .
the second world war was in its fifth year ... and still going hitler' s way .
german troops controlled most of europe .
d day changed all that .
june 6 , 1944 ... when the allied forces , under their commander general eisenhower ...
ianded on the northern coast of france .
by july they were able to begin their own offensive .
by august , paris was liberated .
everywhere the germans retreated .
but with the allied victories came problems .
supplies still had to be driven from normandy , over 400 miles away ... and became dangerously short .
the allied advance began to come to a halt .
another problem facing eisenhower was this : his two most famous generals patton , who was in the south ... and montgomery in the north disliked each other intensely .
the longstanding rivalry had never been more fierce .
there simply were not enough supplies for both armies .
each wanted to be the one to defeat the germans .
each wanted to beat the other to berlin .
in september , 1944 ...
montgomery devised a new and spectacular plan ... given the code name " market garden .
eisenhower , under great pressure from his superiors ... finally sided with montgomery ... and operation market garden became a reality .
the plan , like so many plans in so many wars before it ... was meant to end the fighting by christmas ... and bring the boys back home .
what is that noise ?
can i look out ?
no , they might shoot us .
the germans have collapsed .
then the war is over ?
soon .
but what is that noise ?
panic .
you may begin .
may i first be permitted to say , and i think i speak for all of us ... how pleased we are , field marshal von rundstedt ... that you have been reappointed commander of our forces in the west .
speeches are for victory celebrations .
let' s get to the point .
air power ?
air power , field marshal ?
briefly , please .
air power is minimal .
ammunition ?
also minimal .
tanks ...
troops ...
replacements ?
minimal .
morale ?
nonexistent .
what do you think we should do ?
end the war , you fools .
why in the world are you laughing ?
excuse us .
we have such confidence in you .
everyone knows you have never lost a battle .
i' m still young .
give me time .
the first thing we must do ... is to turn this rabble into something like an army .
anything at all on when they plan to invade holland ?
they seem to have paused in belgium .
most likely supply problems .
otherwise we can' t imagine why .
i think it' s because we' re retreating ... faster than they can advance .
how many vehicles in the past hour ?
fifty four .
and for the same hour yesterday ?
ninety eight .
last week your mother and i could have captured holland alone .
already the panic has stopped .
it isn' t over yet and those idiots don' t realize it .
war takes time .
listen to the expert .
i was nine when they got here .
next month i' il be 14 .
i ought to know something .
father , the allies will come ?
but when ?
i' ve just got back to england from brussels ... where i had a meeting this morning with field marshal montgomery .
there was an earlier one with general eisenhower .
they both feel , as i do ... that when the field marshal' s plan has succeeded ... we should be able to end the war by christmas ... in less than 100 days .
actually , the plan is really very simple .
we' re going to fly 35, 000 men 300 miles , and drop them behind enemy lines .
it' il be the largest airborne operation ever mounted .
quite frankly , this kind of thing' s never been attempted before .
where' s this all going to take place ?
holland .
and when ?
i' m coming to that now .
right .
30 corps , commanded by general horrocks , 20, 000 vehicles .
and this , as you know , is the german front line .
now we' re going to lay a carpet , as it were , of airborne troops ... over which 30th corps can pass .
we shall seize the bridges it' s all a question of bridges with thunderclap surprise ... and hold them until they can be secured .
now first of all , general maxwell taylor ...
eindhoven .
you take and hold the bridges there with 101st .
general gavin , with your 82nd ... you get nijmegen .
you take and hold the bridges .
arnhem .
arnhem bridge .
and you hold it .
for how long ?
monty assures me that 30 corps ... will do the 63 miles in two days .
sixty three miles in two days .
they oughta be able to handle that .
oh , i' m sorry .
general sosabowski , you go with your polish brigade with roy urquhart .
i' m so sorry .
roy ... when you' ve secured your bridge ... and 30th corps have got across it , we can turn east ... right into the industrial heart of germany the ruhr .
once we control their factories , there' s not much they can do about it .
and that is the plan .
and we go next sunday .
seven days ?
why not ?
the sooner we go , the better .
we' ve got them on the run .
is something troubling you , general sosabowski ?
i' ve said nothing .
precisely .
your silences are thunderous .
general browning , l
i am a pole ... considered by some to be smart .
if that is so ... it makes me member of a true minority group .
minority groups are more comfortable in silence .
i should have thought the opposite was true .
but you do disapprove ?
i am thrilled that your great field marshal montgomery has devised a plan .
i promise you , i' il be properly ecstatic if it works .
when it works .
of course .
when it works .
thank you .
well , now let' s get down to the details .
first we shall have to have
from which direction will their attack come , and who will command ?
montgomery or patton ?
model , what do you think ?
patton .
he is their best .
patton will lead the assault .
i would prefer montgomery ... but even eisenhower isn' t that stupid .
bittrich' s panzer troops need some rest ... if they' re to stop patton .
we should pull them back somewhere safe .
safe , quiet , out of the way .
but where ?
arnhem ?
arnhem .
i' il be in touch .
that' il be fine .
why the emergency meeting ?
keeping abreast of the little changes .
how big are the little changes ?
i' il answer you with typical british understatement : gigantic .
they can' t get us all in at once .
too many men , too much equipment , not enough planes .
it' s going to take three days to get the men into arnhem , poles and the british .
how about us ?
we' il be all right .
aside from the fact that we' il parachute in daylight , we have no worries .
daylight ?
has it ever been tried before ?
not in a major drop .
think there might be a reason for that ?
let' s hope not .
what do you think ?
it' il be all right .
it' s a " no moon " period anyway .
we have to go in daylight .
just so they get us over the target area , half a mile away .
three quarters of a mile i' il settle for that .
i don' t want to hear anything else .
is there anything else ?
well , you' re my dutch advisor , harry .
i forgot to tell you something ?
only that the germans first tried to take nijmegen bridge themselves ... back in 1940 , and got slaughtered .
go back !
go back !
do as i say !
but my friend lives down the road .
it' s my birthday and she has a present for me .
please let me through .
all right .
be quick .
are you sure about the colors ?
i' m sure , father .
believe me .
model ?
a field marshal in arnhem ?
why ?
the british will have an explanation .
did you pass on the message about the tanks ?
of course .
but model is something more important .
you' re a good boy and a wonderful spy .
now go and help your mother with supper .
sir ?
yes , fuller ?
we' ve got some information on tanks .
what ?
dutch underground reports from the arnhem area .
established their strength ?
no , sir , but i' ve got
have they been identified ?
not by our intelligence , sir .
so it' s the same rumors as before , right ?
i believe these rumors , sir .
why ?
the general consensus of opinion is that our opposition ... will consist entirely of hitler youth or old men on bicycles .
i don' t really know why , sir .
perhaps because no one in lntelligence does .
i just want to be sure our airborne carpet ... consists of live troops , not dead ones .
i know everybody thinks i' m overanxious , sir ... but i would like to order another low level reconnaissance of the area .
if that' s all right with you , sir .
very well .
all right , wilson .
very well .
i wouldn' t be too concerned about what people think of you .
you happen to be somewhat brighter than most of us .
tends to make us nervous .
naturally we' il do our utmost to meet your tactical requirements , sir .
but please keep in mind ... the one factor which is crippling all our plans .
it may seem improbable to you ... but we are desperately short of transport aircraft .
i am aware of that .
i was surprised that nobody mentioned it to monty when he dreamed up this plan .
i need drop zones as close as possible to the bridge .
this area' s no use at all .
can' t have my chaps landing on chimney tops , but this looks inviting here .
what' s the terrain like ?
sorry , sir .
our reports indicate that this terrain is too soft for glider landings .
the nose digs in first on touchdown , the thing goes ass over tip .
total write off .
all right .
what about there ?
afraid not , sir .
you see , after the drop , when we bank for our return ... we run into a whole lot of flak ... from this jerry airfield up here at deelen .
presumably you' re intending to let us land somewhere ?
oh , yes .
hopefully , sir .
but as i was saying , we cannot afford to lose a single aircraft .
that is the problem .
my problem is , i don' t just need drop zones .
i need drop zones i can hold and defend .
the rest of my division arrives with the second drop ... and general sosabowski' s polish brigade with the third .
i understand , sir , but we really think we' ve found the right place .
it' s large enough for your needs , it' s flat and firm .
it' s also easily defended .
where the hell is it ?
well , it' s not actually on this photograph .
it should be excuse me , sir
it would be about here , i think .
that could be ten miles from the bridge .
it' s just under eight actually , sir , if you' d like to have a look at this .
you see , the terrain is easy to traverse .
all our information substantiates that .
yes , sir ?
just making sure whose side you' re on .
now , a drop zone eight miles from arnhem bridge ... might be thought by some to present problems .
my god , he can' t mean it .
i' m afraid he does .
must know what he' s doing .
that' s more than i know .
why should he have a corner on the market ? ... cannot under any stretch of the imagination be considered ideal .
but the gliders will be bringing in a reconnaissance squadron of jeeps ... specially fitted with twin vickers machine guns .
the instant we land , they will race ahead to the bridge ... and hold it ... until the other battalions arrive on foot .
and they' il be quick enough to secure both ends of arnhem bridge ?
most certainly .
good .
my headquarters will be in the center with 82nd .
now , just you remember that we' re all totally interlocked .
this is a bottom to top operation .
101st pass 30 corps on to 82nd .
82nd pass them on to british airborne .
if any one group fails , it' s total failure for us all .
all we need now are three days of clear skies .
thank you , gentlemen , very much .
only the weather can stop us now .
weather !
cristos !
what of the germans ?
don' t you think that since we know ... that arnhem is so crucial to their safety , they might know that too ?
now look here .
the few troops in the area are ... second class .
they' re not front line caliber .
not at all .
do you understand ?
you ought to have more faith in montgomery' s intelligence reports .
he' s done pretty well for us in the last three or four years .
i will tell you the extent of my faith .
i' m thinking of asking for a letter from you ... stating that i was forced to act on your orders ... in case my men are massacred .
i see .
yes , i do see .
do you wish such a letter ?
of course not .
in the case of massacre , what difference would it make ?
you don' t believe me , sir ?
clearly not .
all right , boys , naafi' s up .
take your break .
god almighty !
sorry about that , sir .
but what then ?
i just don' t believe these damn radios are strong enough ... to carry the eight miles from the drop zone to arnhem bridge .
don' t happen to have any cigarettes , do you , sir ?
they' re perfectly okay .
i' ve used them god knows how many times .
you' ve already told me that god knows how many times .
well , i didn' t have any problems with them in the desert .
yes , i know , but you see , cole ... what genuinely and truly has me more than a bit disturbed is that holland ... being half underwater , is soggier than most deserts you' re apt to find .
tends to have a lot more trees .
any biscuits ?
your biscuits are in your tin , sir .
shouldn' t you tell the general if you' re so certain about it , sir ?
if i were , believe me , i would .
what if they really don' t work ?
what difference will it make ?
the general will be on the bridge himself by nightfall .
he won' t have to make contact with the bridge if he' s on it , will he , sir ?
well , if anyone rocks the boat ... it' s not gonna be me .
the regular projector chap' s at lunch , sir .
i' il have it in a moment .
you' re doing splendidly , fuller .
don' t worry .
i don' t need lunch .
damn .
nearly there , sir .
it' s really worth your time , sir .
believe me .
there .
splendid view of the dutch countryside .
can' t see any tanks .
wait a moment , sir .
it' s a lot clearer in the next picture .
if i can just
now .
next .
yes , sir .
i' ve had this one enlarged .
i shouldn' t worry about them .
but , sir , you see that they are tanks .
i doubt if they' re fully serviceable .
still got guns .
so have we .
but , sir ... if they weren' t serviceable , why would they try to conceal them ?
normal routine , fuller .
but , sir , we keep getting reports from the dutch underground .
i' ve read them !
and so has field marshal montgomery .
now look here .
there have been thousands of photographs from this sortie and from the others .
how many of them have shown tanks ?
just these , sir .
and you seriously consider asking us to cancel ... the biggest operation mounted since d day ... because of three photographs ?
no , sir .
sixteen consecutive drops have been cancelled in the last few months ... for one reason or another .
but this time the party' s on ... and no one is going to call it off .
is that fully understood ?
yes , sir .
thank you , waddy .
thank you , gentlemen .
do sit down , gentlemen .
please sit down .
look after these .
thank you , gentlemen .
thank you .
gentlemen , this is a story that you will tell your grandchildren ... and mightily bored they' il be .
the plan is called operation market garden .
market is the airborne element , and garden the ground forces
that' s us .
now this is our position on the belgian border here .
tomorrow , three airborne divisions will begin landing in holland thirty five thousand men taking off from 24 airfields ... in troop carrying planes or towed in gliders .
the american 101st here ... around eindhoven ... the american 82nd here ... south of nijmegen ... and our own 1st airborne boys and a polish brigade ... here at arnhem ... sixty four miles ... behind enemy lines .
now , their job is to take and hold ... all the bridges in these three areas .
our job is to punch a hole ... through the german front line here ... and then drive like hell up this road ...
iinking up with each airborne division on the way up .
speed is the vital factor .
the plan is to reach eindhoven in two to three hours ... and arnhem in two to three days .
that , gentlemen , is the prize : the bridge over the rhine ... the last bridge between us and germany .
kickoff will be at 1435 hours tomorrow afternoon .
the lrish guards , under the command of colonel vandeleur , will take the lead .
christ , not us again .
what do you say to that , joe ?
delighted , sir .
truly delighted .
i' ve selected you to lead us ... not only because of your extraordinary fighting ability ... but also because ... in the unlikely event that the germans ever get you ... they will assume from your attire that they' ve captured a wretched peasant ... and immediately send you on your way .
now , maintaining the speed of our advance ... will no doubt be tough going , as it' s a single highway .
but no matter what ... we must reach those 1st airborne boys in 48 hours .
now , gentlemen ...
i' m not saying that this will be the easiest party ... that we' ve ever attended ... but i still wouldn' t miss it for the world .
i like to think of this ... as one of those american western films .
the paratroops , lacking substantial equipment ... always short of food
these are the besieged homesteaders .
the germans well , naturally they' re the bad guys .
and 30 corps
we , my friends , are the cavalry ... on the way to the rescue .
do you want me to pack that as well , sir ?
no , thank you , wicks .
i' il carry it .
you haven' t forgotten my golf clubs , have you ?
they' il be coming later in the staff car , sir .
and what about
sorry , sir ?
what about my dinner jacket ?
are you sure you' il be needing that , sir ?
well , let' s hope so .
why don' t you quit that ?
chock full of vitamins .
here , eddie .
have a little strength .
hey , where' d you put that ?
damn it , eddie , give it back .
right .
there you are .
i wish you hadn' t done that .
my problem is , i' m not totally crazy about the prospect of dyin ' .
so don' t die .
drinkin ' that garbage isn' t gonna keep you alive .
what is ?
not gettin ' shot .
and what can guarantee that ?
nothin ' , for sure .
you will .
i will what ?
you tell me , eddie .
you tell me i won' t die .
all right , you won' t die .
no , no .
guarantee me .
i want you to guarantee me i won' t die .
i guarantee you .
come on .
let' s get some food in you .
i wasn' t kidding .
hey , eddie , were you kidding ?
major fuller .
my name is sims .
mind a bit of company ?
of course not , sir .
busy times .
you must be exhausted .
are you exhausted ?
who isn' t ?
we' ve been getting reports from a number of your friends .
they' re worried about you .
they think perhaps you need a rest .
we all need rest .
why are you saying this to me ?
is it because i rocked the boat ?
i' m a doctor .
i' m only concerned with your health .
i think perhaps you ought to take a bit of sick leave .
but why ?
i' m not ill or anything .
i haven' t done anything wrong .
of course not .
you' re just a little tired .
i am tired .
i think perhaps we might go .
can' t it be stopped ?
i don' t want to be left behind , please .
it' s out of my hands , laddie .
i didn' t want to miss the party .
move it , buddy .
that' s the way .
home , sweet home .
when you think we only had seven days to get everything organized , it' s quite a
bloody miracle .
it took six months to set up the d day drop ... and that was only half as big as this .
how do you feel ?
fine .
i' il feel even better when we' re in holland .
do you remember when i was appointed to this command ...
i told you i had never jumped , but thought i ought to give it a go ?
well , you did me a big favor .
really ?
what ?
you said , " roy , you' re far too old for that kind of thing , and much too large .
did l ?
what was the favor ?
well , i didn' t quite tell you everything at the time ... but i' m prone to airsickness .
good gracious .
what , every flight ?
well , we' il soon find out , won' t we ?
go on !
get that goddamn jeep outta here !
who would true valor see
let him come hither
one here will constant be
come wind come weather
there' s no discouragement
soon be home , harry .
better than the desert , eh , sir ?
what was that ?
easier than walking , sir .
if you say so , hancock .
yeah , fine , sir .
the artillery should be able to clear the way very well .
your initial advance .
yes , we' il move off as soon as their barrage has got going .
yes , that' s absolutely fine .
follow behind it as close as we can .
but you know ... this isn' t gonna be the pushover that everybody seems to think it is .
no , i didn' t think so .
morning , alan .
your sleeping beauties know there' s a war on , do they ?
absolutely , sir .
is it true that the germans have put more troops into the line ahead of us ?
yes .
they obviously don' t intend to just let us walk in the front door .
hello , bob !
hope that' s not my funeral they' re going to .
and i' m still desperately worried ... about having them throw everything up this road .
but there' s no alternative .
morning , tom .
so i' ve decided to run the road like a railway .
nobody , repeat , nobody will be allowed ... to put any vehicle on that road without my permission .
including me ?
good luck to you !
you too !
especially you , joe .
morning , derek !
glad to see somebody knows where we' re going .
time , joe .
that' s the killer .
we can' t afford to drop behind schedule .
so for god' s sake , keep your tanks on the move .
good god almighty .
that' s just the 101st .
the other two groups are on the northern route .
h hour in 90 minutes .
i' d better be going , sir .
right you are , joe .
any last minute changes , bob ?
yes , sir .
if the advance runs into difficulty , we call in the air force with purple smoke .
first class .
and good luck , joe !
thank you , sir .
think you' il be able to manage it ?
i' ve got nothing else planned for this afternoon .
i told you you should have had the bloody thing out .
what the hell' s that ?
it' s flak .
general bittrich !
in here , matthias .
fantastic , isn' t it ?
just once to have such power in my hands .
red on .
come on , move yourselves !
if there' s no more opposition than this on the road , we should be all right .
where the hell do you think you' re going ?
b company , to me !
a company , over there !
excuse the interruption , field marshal , but ...
british paratroopers have landed ... three kilometers from here .
why should they do that ?
there is nothing important here .
me !
i am important .
they must all be coming just to capture me .
call my chauffeur and car .
evacuate the headquarters .
and don' t forget my cigars .
general !
you all right ?
yeah .
okay , you guys , gather your stuff and move !
this is it , jim .
okay , sir .
you okay ?
right !
let' s go !
then keep trying .
there must be someone there !
my apologies .
i can get no sense from anybody .
they say thousands of troops are dropping over holland .
yes , west of arnhem .
right on top of field marshal model .
i can' t get through to his headquarters .
a strong force has landed south of nijmegen .
nijmegen ?
they' re after the bridge .
that doesn' t matter .
perhaps they' ve landed in the field marshal' s soup .
yes , you' d like that , wouldn' t you ?
now listen .
i' il take care of arnhem .
you get to nijmegen as fast as you can .
take anything that' il move ... every man that can walk , and hold the bridge .
no .
field marshal model .
nothing must cross it .
is that clear ?
you must hold that bridge under any circumstances .
understood ?
clear .
ryan and ross , come with me .
cover the right flank .
how far away is headquarters ?
half a mile .
maybe more .
brigadier lathbury' s just left , sir .
johnny frost and the 2nd battalion are on the river road .
good .
thank you , baker .
any news of freddie gough' s jeep squadron ?
it' s unconfirmed  it' s rather bad luck , sir .
considering how few gliders we lost on the way in .
it appears that a lot of the special jeeps failed to arrive ... and those that did have been badly shot up in an ambush .
so no one' s going to get to arnhem bridge except on foot .
splendid .
they must be from the lunatic asylum , located on the far side of the wood .
they escaped when it was bombed this morning .
do you think they know something we don' t ?
all guns , commence firing !
right , get moving .
get moving .
driver , advance .
start the purple !
start the purple !
take cover !
loading !
fire !
get the wounded down the line .
get that wreck off the road .
joe , how the hell
how the hell do they expect us to keep to schedule on a road like this ?
you don' t know the worst .
this bit we' re on now  yes ?
it' s the wide part .
