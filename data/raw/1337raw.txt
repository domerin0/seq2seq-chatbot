baltimore , md 1980
think to yourself that every day is your last ...
the hour to which you do not look forward ...
will come as a welcome surprise .
as for me ...
when you want a good laugh ...
you will find me , in a fine state ...
fat and sleek ...
a true hog of epicurus ' herd .
and we find you cribbing lines from horace , as well .
well done , john .
i must say , hannibal ... speaking for the rest of the herd ...
i' m sorry , for the symphony board ... that these little soirees of yours ... are always the highlight of our year .
just so .
you' re too kind .
i do feel guilty enjoying tonight when a musician is ... still listed as a missing person .
yes , poor fellow .
shall i confess something wicked ?
i can' t help feeling the tiniest bit ... relieved .
it sounds awful , i know .
but , let' s face it , so does the man' s playing .
hannibal , confess .
what is this divine looking <i>amuse bouche</ i> ?
lf i tell you ...
i' m afraid you won' t even try it .
<i> bon apptit . </ i>
<i> bon apptit . </ i>
special agent graham .
what an unexpected pleasure .
i' m sorry to bother you again , dr. lecter .
i know it' s late .
it' s no bother .
we' re both night owls , i think .
come in , please .
thank you .
let me take your coat .
what' s on your mind ?
we' ve been on the wrong track this whole time .
you and l .
our whole profile' s wrong .
we' ve been looking for someone with a crazy grudge ... and some kind of anatomical knowledge .
decertified doctors , med school dropouts ...
laid off mortuary workers
from the precision of the cuts , and his choice of souvenirs .
that' s where we' re off target .
he' s not collecting body parts .
then why keep them ?
he' s not .
he' s eating them .
no , listen .
we were at molly' s parents ' for new year' s ... and her dad was showing my son , josh ... how to carve a roasted chicken .
he said , " the tenderest part of the chicken is the oysters ...
on either side of the back .
i had never heard that expression before , " oysters .
then suddenly i had a flash of the third victim ...
darcy taylor .
she was missing flesh from her back .
and then it hit me .
liver , kidney , tongue , thymus .
every single victim lost some body part used in cooking .
have you shared this with the bureau ?
no , i needed to see you first .
but i' m right .
i know i' m right .
i' m starting to be able to think like this one .
yeah , it' s fascinating .
you know , i' d always suspected as much .
you are an eidetiker .
i' m not psychic , doctor .
no , this is different .
more akin to artistic imagination .
you can assume the emotional point of view of others ... even those that might scare or sicken you .
it' s a troubling gift , i should think .
how i' d love to get you on my couch .
something still doesn' t make sense to me .
you' re the best forensic psychiatrist i know ... and somehow , in all our time together ... this possibility never occurred to you .
i am only human , will .
perhaps i made a mistake .
you don' t strike me as a man who makes very many mistakes .
now i' m sorry to think i might ... no longer enjoy your full confidence .
no , i didn' t say that .
i don' t know what i' m saying .
i' m very , very tired .
i almost had it .
it' il come to you .
why don' t you come back in the morning ?
i' il clear some time on my schedule and ... then we can get started in revising our profile .
sound good ?
yeah .
rest here , and i' il get your coat .
won' t be a tick .
don' t move .
you' re in shock now .
i don' t want you to feel any pain .
ln a moment you' il begin to be light headed .
then drowsy .
don' t resist .
it' s so gentle .
like slipping into a warm bath .
i regret it came to this , will .
but every game must have its ending .
remarkable boy .
i do admire your courage .
i think i' il eat your heart .
marathon , fl several years later
hey , dad .
someone' s here .
hey .
you' ve got a beautiful set up here , will .
yeah , it' s good .
you know why i' m here ?
yeah , i can guess .
how much do you know ?
just what was in the <i>miami herald</ i> and the <i>times</ i> .
two families killed a month apart in their homes .
birmingham and atlanta .
the circumstances were similar .
not similar .
the same .
what have you kept out of the papers ?
he smashes mirrors and uses the pieces .
wears latex gloves , so we' ve got no prints .
size 1 1 shoe .
he' s not too comfortable with locks .
pried open a patio door in birmingham ... used a glass cutter in atlanta .
and his blood' s ab positive .
somebody hurt him ?
nope .
we typed him from semen and saliva .
he' s a secretor .
tell me something , will .
you knew what this was .
did you ever consider picking up the phone and giving me a call ?
you' ve got all the people you need .
you' ve got dortmund at harvard .
you got bloom in chicago .
i' ve got you down here fixing boat motors ?
yeah , i like fixing boat motors .
i wouldn' t be very useful to you .
i don' t think about it anymore .
really ?
the last two we had , you caught .
by doing what you and the other guys are doing .
that' s not entirely true .
it' s the way you think .
come on .
there' s been a lot of bullshit about the way i think .
i' ve got technicians to examine evidence ... but you' ve got that other thing .
lmagination .
projection .
whatever .
i know you don' t like it .
you wouldn' t like it , either .
this freak killed the jacobis in birmingham ... on saturday night , february 25 .
full moon .
<i>he killed the leeds family</ i> <i>in atlanta ... </ i> <i>a few nights ago , march 28 . </ i>
<i>one day short of a lunar month . </ i>
lf we' re lucky , we may have a little over three weeks ... before he does it again .
will , do you respect my judgment ?
of course .
i think we have a better chance to catch him fast if you help .
go to atlanta and look .
just look .
then help me brief the locals .
that' s it .
<i>crawford has</ i> <i>the whole damn government . </ i>
<i>why does he need you ? </ i>
he just wants me to look at some evidence , molly .
give him another point of view .
it' s a few days , a week maybe , and i' il be right back .
and you believed that ?
yes .
these kinds of cases come up very rarely ... and i' ve had experience .
yes , you have .
you' re paid up , will .
all of us .
even josh .
there' s a chance i could help them save some lives .
how do i say no to that ?
this one will never see me or know my name .
i' il just help them find him .
the cops will take him down , not me .
i' il be in the back of the pack , molly , i promise .
never in your life .
i know you .
come on .
come here .
i love you .
see you in a few days .
okay .
i' il call you tonight .
' bye , dad !
leeds house , atlanta , ga
where' s the dog ?
no one heard barking .
there' s nothing about it in the case file .
the intruder enters in the dark and cuts charles leeds ' throat .
he shoots valerie leeds in the stomach as she' s rising ... disabling her but not killing her .
he leaves her to watch her husband die ... then turns and goes down the hall .
the children were ....
the children were still in bed when they were shot ... which might indicate that he used a silencer .
he dragged the bodies into the master bedroom , but why ?
they were already dead and none of them got the same ... extra attention as mrs. leeds .
small pieces of mirror were inserted ... in the orbital sockets of the victims .
this occurred post mortem .
why did you put mirrors in their eyes ?
the pieces of mirror are to make their eyes look alive !
he wanted an audience .
he wanted them all lined up ... watching him when he touched her .
when he touched her .
touched .
talcum powder .
there was talcum powder .
mrs. leeds had traces of talcum on her right inner thigh .
a complete search of the home ...
led to no such matching talcum in the house .
you took your gloves off , didn' t you ?
you son of a bitch !
you took your gloves off , touched her ... with your bare hand and wiped her down .
but when the gloves were off , did you open her eyes ?
crawford .
<i>are the leeds ' bodies</ i> <i>still at the morgue ? </ i>
who' s good with latent prints here ?
<i>atlanta p. d. </ i>
they' ve already printed the bodies .
not the bodies .
tell them to check the eyes .
mrs. leeds ' eyes .
even her corneas .
i think he took his gloves off .
i think he had to touch her .
jesus , will .
gentlemen .
ladies .
<i>this is what the subject' s teeth</ i> <i>look like . </ i>
<i>the impressions came from</ i> <i>bite marks on mrs. leeds . </ i>
this degree of crookedness ... plus the groove in this central incisor ... makes his bite signature unique .
fuckin ' shark .
knock it off !
we' re grateful to have the fbl .
they have a lot of expertise in this area .
ln particular , lnvestigator graham does .
that right , jack ?
yes , sir .
anything you want to add , mr. graham ?
why don' t you come on up to the front , please ?
that' s the guy .
was he ?
yeah , that' s the guy who arrested lecter .
i thought he retired .
the son of a bitch just about gutted him .
mrs. leeds and mrs. jacobi were the primary targets .
the others were killed just to complete his fantasy .
i know that might be hard to accept given what you saw ... but this was not random .
this wasn' t some killing frenzy .
he was never out of control .
these attacks were organised , the women carefully chosen .
we don' t know how he' s choosing them , or why .
they lived in different states and never met .
but there is some connection .
there' s some common factor , and that' s the key .
find out what that is , and we' il save lives .
' cause this one is gonna go on and on ... until we get smart or we get lucky .
he won' t stop .
why not ?
because it makes him god .
would you give that up ?
you asked about the dog .
last night a vet called us .
leeds and his oldest boy brought the dog in ... the afternoon before they were killed .
had a puncture wound to its abdomen .
the vet had to put it down .
was it wearing a collar with the address on it ?
no .
did the jacobis have a dog ?
no dog .
they found a litter box in the basement ... cat droppings in it , no cat .
lf the cat was attacked , the jacobis may have buried it .
ask birmingham to check that backyard .
and tell them to use a methane probe , it' s faster .
yeah .
it' s for you .
crawford .
carl , you' re the light of my life .
<i>would it hold up in court ? </ i>
<i>okay .
great work . </ i>
they found a print on mrs. leeds ' eye .
partial thumb .
besides that , there' s nothing else to tell you .
thank you for your time .
i can' t answer more questions .
will graham !
remember me ?
freddy lounds .
i covered the lecter case for the <i>tattler</ i> .
did the paperback .
yeah , i remember .
when did they bring you in ?
what' ve you got ?
you think the tooth fairy will be bigger than lecter ?
i mean , he' s already beaten lecter' s score
you write lying shit , and the <i>tattler</ i> is an asswipe !
you stay away from me .
get away , lounds .
how about an exclusive ?
sorry about that .
that guy snuck into the hospital and took those pictures of me .
remember ?
with the tubes hanging out of me ?
forget that prick .
give yourself some credit .
when we catch the tooth fairy ... that print plus his teeth will burn him .
you did that , will .
that evidence was there , jack .
it was there for anyone to see .
but nobody else did .
all i' m sayin ' is , that was very good work .
no , good work would be seeing it all the way through ... and catching the guy .
and i can' t do that .
i did what you asked me to do .
i' m going home .
i don' t even have any idea who this guy is .
what i just gave them was broad strokes .
he' s got no face to me .
that' s what you said about garrett hobbs , remember ?
and you figured him out .
no , i didn' t .
you didn' t ?
no , i was stuck on hobbs .
i had help .
from lecter .
yeah .
jack , don' t play games with me .
don' t do it .
just tell me what' s on your mind .
i' m saying maybe we' ve got a resource we should look into .
ls that what this was about ?
did you just want to ask me that all along ?
don' t get mad at me .
i' m just doing my job .
lf you know a better shortcut , let me know it .
lf you think there' s any chance he' il talk to me ...
i' il go myself .
lf you can' t handle it , god knows i' d understand that .
<i>as a research subject , lecter</ i> <i>has proven most disappointing . </ i>
he' s simply impenetrable to psychological testing .
rorschach , thematic apperception .
he folds them into origami .
as you see .
so you can imagine the stir your little visit ... is causing among my staff , mr. graham .
lf you' d care to share some insights
dr. chilton , i' m sorry , i' ve got a 4 : 1 7 flight back to atlanta .
of course .
tell me , when you saw lecter' s murders ... their style , so to speak ... were you able , perhaps , to reconstruct his fantasies ?
and , if so , did you jot down any impressions ?
no .
let me be frank , mr. graham .
the first analysis of lecter will be a publisher' s wet dream .
i' d give you full credit , of course .
damn it , man .
you must have some advice .
you caught him .
what was your trick ?
i let him kill me .
that' s the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court .
i keep getting it for christmas .
christmas , yes .
did you get my card ?
i got it , thank you .
so nice of the bureau' s crime lab to forward that .
<i>they wouldn' t give me</ i> <i>your home address . </ i>
dr. bloom sent me your article on surgical addiction ... in the <i>journal of forensic psychiatry</ i> .
and ?
very interesting , even to a layman .
you say you' re a layman .
but it was you who caught me .
wasn' t it , will ?
do you know how you did it ?
i got lucky .
i don' t think you believe that .
it' s in the transcript .
what does it matter now ?
it doesn' t matter to me , will .
i need your advice , dr. lecter .
birmingham and atlanta .
you want to know how he' s choosing them , don' t you ?
i thought you' d have ideas .
i want you to tell me them .
why should l ?
there are things you don' t have .
research materials .
maybe even computer access .
i' d speak to the chief of staff .
yes , dr. chilton .
gruesome , isn' t he ?
he fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at panties .
lf you recall , will ... our last collaboration ended rather messily .
you' d get to see the file on this case .
and there' s another reason .
i' m all ears .
i thought you might enjoy the challenge .
find out if you' re smarter than the person i' m looking for .
then , by implication , you think you' re smarter than i am ... since it was you who caught me .
i know i' m not smarter than you .
then how did you catch me ?
you had disadvantages .
what disadvantages ?
you' re insane .
you' re very tanned , will .
<i>and your hands are so rough . </ i>
<i>not like a cop' s hands anymore . </ i>
and that shaving lotion is something a child would select .
has a little ship on the bottle , does it not ?
and how is young josh and the lovely molly ?
<i>they' re always in my thoughts, </ i> <i>you know . </ i>
you will not persuade me with appeals ... to my intellectual vanity .
i don' t think i' il persuade you at all .
you' il either do it or you won' t .
lecter : ls that the case file ?
yes .
with photos ?
let me keep them , and i might consider it .
no .
do you dream much , will ?
goodbye , dr. lecter .
you haven' t threatened to take away my books yet !
give me the file , then !
and i' il tell you what i think .
i' il need one hour .
and privacy .
just like old times , will ?
this is a very shy boy , will .
i' d love to meet him .
have you considered that he is disfigured ... or that he may believe he is disfigured ?
yeah , the mirrors .
notice he smashes all the mirrors ... not just enough to get the pieces he wants .
and , of course , those shards in their eyes ... so he can see himself there .
that' s interesting .
no , it' s not .
you thought of it before .
i had considered it .
what about the women ?
dead ?
mere puppets .
you need to see them living , the way they caught his eye .
that' s impossible .
almost .
not quite .
what were the yards like ?
big backyards , fenced , some hedges .
why ?
because if this pilgrim ... feels a special relationship with the moon ... he might like to go outside and look at it .
you ever seen blood in the moonlight ?
it appears quite black .
lf one were nude , say , it' d be better to have ... outdoor privacy for that sort of thing .
you think the yards are a factor when he selects victims ?
yes .
and there will be more of them , of course .
victims .
you' il be wanting lots of these little chinwags ...
i take it .
i might not have time .
i do .
i have oodles .
i need your opinion now .
you stink of fear under that cheap lotion .
you stink of fear , will , but you' re not a coward !
you fear me , but still you came here .
you fear this shy boy , yet still you seek him out .
don' t you understand , will ?
you caught me because we' re very much alike .
without our imaginations ... we' d be like all those other poor dullards .
fear is the price of our instrument .
<i>but i can help you bear it . </ i>
you getting his face ?
yeah .
okay , you got it ?
all right , let' s get the fuck out of here .
<i>sure you' re okay ? </ i>
yeah , i' m okay .
<i>what do you think he</ i> <i>meant by " see them living " ? </ i>
i don' t know , maybe nothing .
it' s hard to separate his bullshit .
but i' m gonna make another pass at the leeds ' house .
<i>all right , duchess , doll . </ i>
<i>that' s it . </ i>
<i>show me what you can do . </ i>
<i>who' s that ?
get them , duchess . </ i>
<i>get them , duch !

<i>go get them , girl ! </ i>

<i>do you understand ? </ i>
i' il be a good boy .
i promise .
good morning , will .
so nice of you to visit again .
he carved this on a tree near the jacobi house .
with a buck knife .
the same one later used on charles leeds .
yes .
take a walk with me .
he had a second tool , too .
a bolt cutter .
he used that to clear his view .
but ?
i don' t think that' s what he brought it for .
it' s too heavy .
too awkward .
and he had to carry it a long way .
and what do we make of that symbol ?
asian studies at langley ... identified it as a chinese character .
it appears on a mah jong piece .
it marks the red dragon .
red dragon .
correct .
this boy begins to interest me .
we don' t know what greater meaning the symbol might have
do you like my little exercise cage , will ?
<i>my so called lawyer</ i> <i>is always nagging dr. chilton ... </ i> <i>for better accommodations . </ i>
i don' t know which is the greater fool .
perhaps if you could offer some insight into
a robin redbreast in a cage puts all heaven in a rage
ever been a redbreast , will ?
of course you have .
i' m allowed 30 minutes in here , once a week .
get to the point .
he meant to use the bolt cutter to enter the house ... but he didn' t .
lnstead he broke in through the patio doors .
the noise woke jacobi , and he had to shoot him on the stairs .
that wasn' t planned .
it was sloppy .
and that' s not like him .
we mustn' t judge too harshly , will .
it was his first time .
have you never felt a sudden rush of panic ?
yeah , that' s the fear we talked about .
<i>it takes experience</ i> <i>to master it . </ i>
you sensed who i was ... back when i was committing what you call my " crimes .
yes .
so you were hurt not by a fault in your perception ... or your instincts ... but because you failed to act on them until it was too late .
you could say that .
but you' re wiser now .
lmagine what you would do , will , if you could go back in time .
put two in your head before you could palm that stiletto .
very good , will .
you know , i believe we' re making progress .
and that' s what our pilgrim is doing .
he is refining his methods .
he is evolving .
the case file mentioned videos of the leeds family .
i' d like to see those .
no .
why not ?
it would be obscene .
you don' t make it easy , do you ?
still , one aims to please .
i' il call you if i think of anything else .
would you perhaps like to leave me your home number ?
that' s the end of our session .
for now .
it was only his first time .
already in atlanta he did much better .
rest assured , my dear will ... this one will give you plenty of exercise .
my love to molly and josh , goodbye .
go to the back of the cell , dr. lecter .
face the wall .
barney : lf you turn around before the lock snaps ... you' il get a dart .
understood ?
yes .
you got ten minutes to talk to your lawyer .

ln fact one of my earliest memories is seeing a cougar ... when i was about five .
<i>i didn' t lose my sight</ i> <i>till i was seven .
diphtheria . </ i>
could you hand me that knife ?
i' ve always tried to hang on to what that cougar looked like .
but by now , to tell the truth , what i see in my head ... is probably not in the least bit like a cougar .
it' s more like a donkey or a goat .
you know , sometimes i' m not so sure i really saw him .
maybe he' s just something i dreamed up .
you okay ?
you don' t say much , do you ?
no , i guess not .
let' s talk about something and get it out of the way , okay ?
i can hear that you' ve had ... some kind of soft palate repair .
but i understand you fine because you speak very well .
lf you don' t want to talk to me , that' s cool .
but i hope that you will , because ...
i know what it' s like to have people ... always thinking that you' re different .
that' s good .
may i touch your face ?
i want to know if you' re smiling or frowning .
i want to know whether i should just shut up or not .
take my word that i' m smiling .
i have to go .
lf i offended you , i didn' t mean to .
no .
f. b. l .
headquarters , washington , d. c.
i don' t know what they were like .
<i>it' d help if i could see</ i> <i>some of their personal effects . </ i>
diaries , letters .
do you have those things ?
i sure do .
i mean , other than ... one or two little keepsakes niles jacobi got .
that would be mr. jacobi' s surviving son by his first wife ?
yes .
as their executor , i keep all that stuff in the office ... along with some of the smaller valuables , till after probate .
but the birmingham p. d. ' s been all through it .
could you pack those things and ship them up to me ?
i hate to ask .
i know it' s a pain in the ass .
hell ... probate judge is an old golfing buddy of mine .
son , just tell me you' re gonna nail that son of a bitch .
we' re doing our best .
hey , thanks , mr. metcalf .
a note hidden in lecter' s cell .
sounds like a fan letter .
might' ve been mailed by the tooth fairy .
he wants lecter' s approval .
he' s curious about you .
he' s asking questions .
i' ve scrambled a chopper .
does lecter know we have the note ?
<i>not yet .
it was found in</ i> <i>a routine cleanup . </ i>
<i>they don' t open his mail ? </ i>
<i>need a warrant . </ i>
<i>x rays only . </ i>
<i>where' s lecter ? </ i>
<i>the holding cage . </ i>
<i>can he see his cell ? </ i>
<i>no .
but he' s been there</ i> <i>almost half an hour . </ i>
<i>he' il soon start to wonder</ i> <i>what' s wrong . </ i>
we got to buy time , jack .
dr. chilton .
<i>yes ? </ i>
call your building superintendent ... or engineer , whoever' s in charge .
tell him to pull the circuit breakers on lecter' s hall .
have the super walk down the hall past the cell ... carrying tools .
he' il be in a hurry , pissed off , too busy to answer questions .
don' t touch the note , okay ?
graham' s on his way .
listen up !
we' ve got a note coming in on the fly ... possibly from the tooth fairy .
number one priority .
it has to go back to lecter' s cell within the hour ... unmarked .
we' il need hair and fibre , latent prints , then documents .
i' il walk it through myself .
let' s go , people !
<i>my dear dr. lecter . : </ i>
<i>i wanted to tell you ... </ i>
<i>i' m delighted ... </ i> <i>that you' ve taken an interest in me . </ i>
<i>and when i learned of your vast</ i> <i>correspondence , i thought . : </ i>
<i>" dare i ? " of course i do . </ i>
<i>i don' t believe</ i> <i>you' il tell them who i am . </ i>
<i>besides , what particular body</ i> <i>i currently occupy is trivial . </ i>
<i>the important thing is</ i> <i>what i am becoming . </ i>
<i>i know that you alone can</ i> <i>understand this transformation . </ i>
<i>i have some things</ i> <i>i' d love to show you . </ i>
<i>if circumstances permit, </ i> <i>i hope we can correspond . </ i>
<i>i have admired you for years</ i> <i>and have ... </ i> <i>a complete collection</ i> <i>of your press notices . </ i>
<i>actually , i think of them</ i> <i>as unfair reviews . </ i>
<i>as unfair as mine . </ i>
<i>they do like to sling demeaning</ i> <i>nicknames , don' t they ? </ i>
<i>" the tooth fairy . " what could be</ i> <i>more inappropriate ? </ i>
<i>it would shame me for you</ i> <i>to read that , if i didn' t know ... </ i> <i>you had suffered the same</ i> <i>distortions in the press . </ i>
i' m fed up with this bloody stupid building !
every day something breaking .
i swear they ought to tear the whole fucking place down .
how much longer do we have ?
ten minutes , max .
bowman : lnstructions for answering ... were probably in the section lecter tore out .
why not just throw the whole note away ?
it was full of compliments .
he couldn' t bear to part with them .
now we can mash just a little .
you' re so sly .
but so am l .
<i>aniline dyes and coloured inks</ i> <i>are transparent to infrared . </ i>
<i>these could be the tips of " t' s" </ i> <i>here and here . </ i>
<i>on the end , that' s a " p , " or possibly an " r. " </ i>
<i>maybe this is where he' s telling</ i> <i>lecter how to answer him . </ i>
there' s only one way to carry on a conversation ... that' s one way blind .
publication .
wait a minute .
we know this guy reads the <i>tattler</ i> .
that' s in his note , right ?
the tooth fairy , they made that up .
three " t' s " and an " r " in " tattler .
how do you communicate through a tabloid ?
you got what ?
news stories .
personals .
maybe he wants lecter to answer him through the personals ?
that could be it .
we need proofs of the pages ... before the next <i>tattler</ i>' s published !
i' m on it !
<i>investigator graham</ i> <i>interests me . </ i>
<i>not your standard gumshoe, </ i> <i>is he ? </ i>
<i>more alert . </ i>
<i>purposeful looking . </ i>
<i>you should have taught him</ i> <i>not to meddle . </ i>
<i>forgive the stationery . </ i>
<i>i chose it because</ i> <i>it' il dissolve very quickly ... </ i> <i>if you should</ i> <i>have to swallow it . </ i>
<i>if i hear from you , next time</ i> <i>i might send you something wet . </ i>
<i>until then , dear doctor ... </ i>
<i>i remain your most ... </ i> <i>avid fan . </ i>
the <i>tattler</ i> got an ad order signed 666 ...
baltimore postmark on the envelope .
<i>it' s set to run this afternoon . </ i>
chicago field office is sending the text through now .
" dear pilgrim .
that' s it .
lecter called him a pilgrim when we talked .
you honour me .
you' re very beautiful . " christ !
i offer 100 prayers for your safety .
find help in john 6 : 22 , 8 : 16 ...
9 : 1 , luke 1 : 7 .
code .
has to be .
we' ve got 19 minutes to get in a message if we can break this .
the <i>tattler</ i> can' t hold its presses any longer .
it' s simple .
they only needed cover against casual readers .
i' m thinking it' s a book code .
code ?
the first numeral ...
100 prayers , " may be the page number .
the numbers after could be line and letter .
but what book ?
bible ?
no , he' s got " galatians 15 : 2 .
it has only six chapters .
same with " jonah 6 : 8 .
it has four chapters .
<i>he wasn' t using a bible . </ i>
then the tooth fairy named the book to use .
he specified it in his note , in the part lecter tore out .
it would appear so .
what about sweating lecter ?
ln a mental hospital ...
i would think drugs  no .
they tried sodium amytal on him three years ago , to find out ... where he buried the princeton student .
he gave them a recipe for dip .
lf we sweat him , we lose the connection .
lf the tooth fairy picked the book ... he knew lecter would have it in his cell .
can we get a list of his books ?
from chilton , maybe .
no !
wait !
rankin and willingham , when they tossed his cell ... took polaroids so they could put everything back in place .
ask them to meet me with pictures of his bookshelves !
where ?
the library !
i' m leery of letting lecter' s message run ... without knowing what it says .
i say let this one run .
we keep working on the code .
at least it' il encourage the fairy to contact him again .
what if it encourages him to do something besides write ?
i don' t like this any better than you .
but it' s our best shot .
national tattler building , chicago , ll
library of congress , washington , d. c.
oh , my god !
hello ?
jack , it' s lloyd bowman .
i solved the code .
you need to know what it says right now .
okay , lloyd .
it says , " graham home , marathon , florida .
save yourself .
kill them all .
yeah ?
<i>bowman just broke the code . </ i>
what does it say ?
i' il tell you in a second .
now , listen to me .
everything is okay .
<i>i' ve taken care of it .
stay on</ i> <i>the phone when i tell you . </ i>
tell me now .
lecter gave the bastard your home address .
<i>wait . </ i>
mum ?
head down , ma' am .
molly : ls he after you now ?
no , lecter just suggested it to him .
i hate this , molly .
i' m sorry .
it' s a sick feeling .
i know it is .
but you' il be safe here .
crawford' s brother owns this place .
no one in the world knows you' re here .
i' d just as soon not talk about crawford .
what are you using as bait ?
sometimes i use worms .
you like those ?
beneath the yellow folder ... you' il find your latest rejection slip ... from the archives .
it was brought to me by mistake with some of my archives mail .
<i>i' m afraid i opened it</ i> <i>without looking . </ i>
sorry .
i think we' il remove dr. lecter' s toilet seat .
<i>atlanta p. d. nailed him . </ i>
he had a fake bureau ld ... and was trying to get the leeds family autopsy photos .
it' s a federal beef , so atlanta kicked him back to us .
personally ...
i' d like nothing better than to see the dirt sandwich ... pulling five at leavenworth .
but maybe there' s a better way to handle this .
yeah ?
what' s that ?
i think we ought to give him a story .
the tooth fairy' s ugly ... and he' s impotent with members of the opposite sex .
also , he sexually molests his male victims .
while they' re alive ?
sorry , i can' t go into those details .
but we do also speculate ... that he' s the product of an incestuous home .
no wonder the creep' s such a loser , right ?
that' s a tip we got from dr. lecter , by the way .
so it' s true that lecter' s helping with your investigation ?
yes , it' s true .
the doctor was offended a bottom feeding lowlife like ... the tooth fairy would consider himself in the same league .
okay , tell me about this place you got here .
will , your little washington hideaway .
this is an apartment i' m borrowing ... till this creep goes down in flames .
i keep copies of the evidence so i can work on it at night .
make sure you can read the name on that building .
yeah .
all right , i got enough .
just remember , i scratch your back , you scratch mine .
lf my story draws the fairy in an attack on graham ... and you nail the scumbag , i get an exclusive .
fuck you , lounds .
when we see the story , we' il consider what to do ... about your sealed indictment .
all right , it was a pleasure doing business with you , chumps .
i feel like i need a shower .
you okay with this ?
better he comes after me than molly and josh .
so , yeah , i' m okay with it .
i wish we had something better ... but there' s only ten days till the next full moon .
we' ve got to rattle his cage .
we' il stake out this apartment , put snipers on the rooftops .
<i>you' il have a moving box tail, </ i> <i>24/ 7 , in your car ... </ i> <i>on the street , wherever you go . </ i>
<i>you' il wear the kevlar</ i> <i>at all times .
no exceptions . </ i>
you again ?
come back at 4 : 00 a . m . when i open , all right ?
hey , i told you !
what ?
<i>you told me what ? </ i>
fucking dickhead !
<i>is that your fucking name</ i> <i>on the sign ? </ i>
where am l ?
what am i doing here ?
atoning , mr. lounds .
i haven' t seen your face .
<i>i couldn' t possibly</ i> <i>identify you . </ i>
i work for the <i>national tattler</ i> .
it would pay ... a big reward for me .
i mean , a half a million ... or a million , maybe .
do you know who i am , mr. lounds ?
no .
and i don' t want to know .
you know , believe me .
according to you , i' m a vicious , perverted sexual failure ... a " bottom feeding lowlife " ... who' s about to " go down in flames .
<i>i think you know now , don' t you ? </ i>
yes .
do you understand what i' m doing , mr. lounds ?
no .
but i would like to .
i really want to understand ... and then all my readers could understand , too .
i am not a man .
<i>i began as one ... </ i> but each being that i change makes me ... more than a man ... as you will witness .
i don' t need to see you .
no .
but you must , mr. lounds .
you' re a reporter .
you' re here to report .
open your eyes and look at me .
no .
lf you won' t open them ...
i' il staple your eyelids to your forehead .
no !
open your eyes !
oh , my dear god jesus !
oh , god !
do you want to know what i am ?
more than anything .
i was afraid to ask .
do you see now ?
yeah , i see .
oh , god .
mrs. jacobi in human form .
do you see ?
yes .
mrs. leeds in human form .
do you see ?
yes .
mrs. jacobi changing .
oh , my god .
mrs. leeds changing .
do you see ?
mrs. jacobi reborn .
<i>do you see ? </ i>
mrs. leeds reborn .
do you see ?
please , no .
no ?
no what ?
not me .
why did you write lies , mr. lounds ?
graham told me to lie .
it wasn' t me .
will you tell the truth now ?
yes !
about me ?
my work ?
oh , yes .
my becoming ?
yeah .
i am the dragon , and you call me insane !
you are privy to a great becoming ... and you recognise nothing .
you are an ant in the afterbirth .
it is in your nature to do one thing correctly .
before me , you rightly tremble .
<i>but fear is not what you owe me, </ i> <i>mr .
lounds . </ i>
you owe me awe .
read .
that' s all , mr. lounds .
<i>you did very well . </ i>
will you let me go now ?
soon .
<i>there' s one more way i can</ i> <i>help you to better understand . </ i>
i want to understand .
i do .
and i' m really gonna be fair ... from now on .
you know that .
hello ?
oh , god , no !
<i>i have had</ i> <i>a great privilege . </ i>
<i>i have seen with ... </ i> <i>wonder and awe the strength</ i> <i>of the great red dragon . </ i>
<i>he has helped me to understand</ i> <i>his splendour ... </ i> <i>and now i want to serve him . </ i>
<i>he knows you made me lie, </ i> <i>will graham . </ i>
<i>because i was forced to lie ... </ i> <i>he will be more merciful to me</ i> <i>than to you . </ i>
<i>hello ? </ i>
<i>oh , god , no ! </ i>
we can let this tie us up in knots ... or we can learn from it .
maybe even use it to catch the bastard .
he had to have a van or panel truck ... to move lounds around in that big old wheelchair .
go on .
he had to already have the wheelchair ... or know where to get one fast .
it' s an antique , not something you' d find in the house .
does it strike anybody that he set this up in a hurry ?
the <i>tattler</ i> comes off the press monday night .
by tuesday morning he' s in chicago , snatching lounds .
he either lives in the chicago area ... or he' s within a driving radius of ... call it six hours .
find out in this area where the <i>tattler</ i> was available ... for early distribution monday night .
<i>start with airports, </ i> <i>all night newsstands . </ i>
maybe a newsie remembers an odd customer .
lloyd , this cassette , enhance the audio .
<i>maybe you can pick up</ i> <i>something in the background . </ i>
that wheelchair ...
i want the maker , date , possible sources .
graham and i will coordinate from chicago .
let' s hustle .
look , there' s not gonna be any answers in chicago , jack .
okay ?
i mean , lounds , that was a bonus .
that was a chance to show off .
it doesn' t even fit his pattern .
the leeds and the jacobis are what he needs .
i think i should go back to baltimore .
after what he tried to pull ?
lecter picked up on something in the missing part of the note .
not a name , but something , enough to narrow the search .
even if he did , he won' t tell you .
not unless i can offer him something .
<i>congratulations . </ i>
that was most artistic , the way you disposed of mr. lounds .
your cell looks bigger with no books in it .
does it ?
i hadn' t noticed .
oh , you will .
i have other resources .
tell me , will .
did you enjoy it ?
your first murder ?
of course you did .
why shouldn' t it feel good ?
it does to god .
why , only last week in texas , he dropped a church roof ... on the heads of 34 of his worshippers ... as they were grovelling through a hymn .
he wouldn' t begrudge you one journalist .
put me next to him , doctor .
you and some swat team ?
oh , will .
where' s the fun in that ?
he' il have to take his chances , too .
a roof can fall on anybody .
but not on molly and josh , i take it .
<i>not yet , anyway . </ i>
first he kills the pet , then the family .
freddy was your pet .
they' re safe now .
no one will ever be safe around you , will .
clever work on his note , by the way .
and that blackout was an especially nice touch .
what else was in that note , doctor ?
put me next to him !
that' s what you want , isn' t it ?
to help him succeed where you failed ?
twice ?
give him a chance to kill me .
go on , then .
seduce me with your wares .
full restoration of your privileges .
plus computer access to the ama archives .
one hour a week under supervision , of course ... but it' s a one time offer .
it expires the minute i walk out of here .
bit measly , don' t you think ?
turn it down , then .
see what terms you get from chilton .
are these threats , william ?
i' m waiting , doctor .
or maybe you' ve got nothing left to sell .
a little sample , then .
why not ?
seen the blake , have you ?
yes .
no , you' ve looked but not seen .
transformation is the key .
the man dragon ... his ugliness transformed by power .
<i>look for a military record</ i> <i>with combat training . </ i>
look for extensive tattooing ... and corrective surgery , most likely to the face .
come on , i' m past that already and you know it .
give me what i need .
how is he choosing the women ?
i' ve already suggested how .
the answer was in front of you .
you looked but didn' t see .
bullshit !
no riddles !
just tell me .
no !
it' s your turn .
i asked you before for a small courtesy ... and you responded rudely .
before i tell you anything more ... you will make certain arrangements for me .
what kind of arrangements ?
oh , nothing much .
shall we say dinner and a show ?
you ready to tell me what kind of outing this is ?
nope .
you' re just full of surprises , aren' t you , d ?
yep .
<i>he' s about six feet away . </ i>
can you smell him ?
yeah .
now , he' s a little noisy , but he' s sedated , i assure you .
<i>doctor hassler' s about to fix</ i> <i>his broken tooth . </ i>
glad you could come , ms. mcclane .
<i>we appreciate the infrared film, </ i> <i>by the way . </ i>
two more steps .
i' il put your left hand on the edge of the table .
now , he' s right in front of you .
take your time .
d ?
i' m here .
you go ahead .
here .
why don' t you try this ?
nine steps from the front door to the clock ... and three more to this room .
sorry .
force of habit .
that beautiful tiger , this house , this music ....
i don' t think anybody knows you at all , d.
everybody wonders about you , though .
especially the women .
what do they want to know ?
they find you ... very mysterious and interesting .
did they tell you how i look ?
they said that you have a remarkable body .
that you' re very sensitive about your face but you shouldn' t be .
oh , and ... they asked me if ... you are as strong as you look .
and ?
i said i didn' t know .
where the hell are you , d ?
here you are .
do you want to know what i think about it ?
now , would you show me where the bathroom is ?
i have to do a little work .
lf i' m keeping you from work ...
no . ... l' il go .
i want you to be here .
i do .
it' s just a tape i need to watch .
<i>it won' t take long . </ i>
do you need to hear it , too ?
no .
may i keep the music ?
what' s it about ?
some people i' m going to meet .
so then ... it' s what ?
it' s a corporate promo ?
some kind of homework ?
it' s homework .
yeah .
that' s a good idea .
it' s so important to be prepared .
my god , are you ever !
no .
i won' t give her to you .
no .
please , just for a little while .
no !
you' re hurting me !
no ... she' s nice .
she' s okay .
i had a really terrific time last night .
but this morning you seem like a different person .
ls something wrong ?
i have to go now .
i have to go away .
where ?
on a trip .
when will i see you again ?
reba , you have to get out .
now .
<i>dear mr. graham . : </ i>
<i>here are the jacobis' </ i> <i>personal effects , as discussed . </ i>
<i>i hope these things</ i> <i>might help you . </ i>
<i>good hunting .
byron metcalf . </ i>
<i>how many more</ i> <i>times are we going to watch this ? </ i>
see them living , " he said , " right in front of you .
<i>it' s something about</ i> <i>these home movies . </ i>
lecter keeps saying , " you looked , but didn' t see .
lecter says a lot of things .
sad damn thing .
but we already knew that .
we can' t afford to let lecter waste our
no .
again .
your dissertation must be nearly finished , mr. crane .
nearly .
it' s nice to be able to connect a face with a name ... after all our correspondence .
but , you know , you don' t look like i imagined you looked .
what did you think i looked like ?
different .
thank you .
right there !
there .
that' s what he wanted the bolt cutter for .
to cut that padlock and go in through the basement .
but that' s a different door .
i don' t get it .
the one i saw was flush steel with deadbolts .
jacobi had a new door installed .
beginning of january , i think .
it' s in here somewhere .
think he cased the house with the old door ?
he brought the bolt cutter , didn' t he ?
he was sure he' d need it .
why case it two months in advance and not check it ?
i don' t know .
he was ready with the bolt cutter ...
like at the leeds ' house .
there he was ready with a glass cutter .
he must' ve seen the glass when he walked in the neighbourhood .
no .
you can' t see that door from the yard .
there' s a porch lattice in the way .
jack , he knew the inside of the houses .
remarkable , isn' t it ?
two hundred years old .
yet so fresh .
<i>so vivid . </ i>
he almost looks alive , doesn' t he ?
we' ve just gotten a report here from the ....
<i>do you still have</ i> <i>the jacobis ' check stubs ... </ i> <i>and credit card statements ? </ i>
we' re looking for any kind of service call or purchase ... that might' ve required a stranger ... to enter the house .
a repairman , delivery guy .
<i>anybody in the house . </ i>
yeah .
<i>we checked . </ i>
i know we checked that ... but now we got to go back to before january .
<i>last year' s purchase orders . </ i>
yeah .
no collar .
but please hurry .
it' s urgent .
no collar .
no collar .
the dog had no collar in a neighbourhood of dogs ... but he knew which was theirs .
same with the jacobis ' cat .
no collar , but he knew .
he knew about the padlock .
he knew about the pane of glass .
<i>he knew the layout . </ i>
<i>he knew how to get in . </ i>
every goddamn thing he needed to know was on this ....
oh , jesus .
ls metcalf still on the phone ?
give it !
byron , it' s graham .
you said niles jacobi took a few keepsakes .
do you have a list ?
<i>yeah , right here . </ i>
i need to know if something he took was a home video .
a full length vhs tape , compiled from shorter tapes .
<i>i see one videotape . </ i>
yes ?
<i>but it says , " meet the jacobis . " </ i>
it' s chromalux .
we just got a fax .
an incident at the brooklyn museum .
<i>a guy attacked two employees, </ i> <i>and get this ... </ i> ate the blake painting .
what ?
that' s him .
it' s got to be .
lf that painting meant so much to him , why destroy it ?
<i>and why didn' t he kill</ i> <i>those two women at the museum ? </ i>
they both got a good look at him .
maybe he' s trying to stop .
mr. crawford , all you' ve got is a hunch .
i' ve got 382 employees , and they' ve got a union .
i can' t just turn you loose on their files .
not without a court order .
there are privacy issues .
the company' s exposure .
one of the employees has already killed 1 1 people ... that we know of .
lf he gets away tonight ... what' s the company' s exposure on that ?
i' il get our lawyers here  we don' t have time for that .
listen !
we' re looking for a white male , 25 to 35 ...
right handed with brown hair .
no
listen !
please .
he' s strong .
he' s possibly a bodybuilder .
he might have some kind of facial disfigurement .
he drives a van or a panel truck .
that sounds like mr. d.
oh , my god .
who' s mr. d ?
francis dolarhyde , manager of technical services .
what does he do exactly ?
he maintains the equipment for tape transfers .
would he have access to people' s home videotapes ?
he has access to every tape that comes through here .
thanks for dinner , and thanks for letting me vent .
look , no problemo .
reba , listen , i know it' s not my place to say this ....
go on .
well , if dolarhyde is really as moody as you say he is ... maybe you ought to keep some distance .
i mean , what do you really know about the guy ?
i appreciate your concern , ralph .
really .
and i promise i' il give it some thought .
hey , have a great vacation .
thanks .
see you in a week .
good night .
i had a great time .
good night .
good night !
ralph , just ' cause i' m feeling vulnerable
wake up .
you wandered around in the house while i was asleep , didn' t you ?
what ?
the other night , did you find something odd ?
