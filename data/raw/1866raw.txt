a young man searching for love in all the wrong places .
his name was frank .
we' re moving through time .
what ?
hi .
my stepsister , like , i sometimes worry that she eats too much .
shut up , kim !
i' m just trying to help .
0h , sweetheart , please !
there' s no reason to be embarrassed here .
many times we eat because we are afraid to face our ego reflection .
we find ourselves looking at the mirror , rather than into and through the mirror .
when we do that , we can finally see how beautiful we are .
thanks !
sure .
come up here .
don' t be afraid .
er , how can i find out what i wanna be when i grow up ?
0h !
that' s a hard one .
well , look deep inside of yourself , deep within your heart , and find what makes you feel love pure , unconditional love and go to that .
in your studies , in your athletics , in your relationships , go towards love .
thank you .
come on up .
next .
how do i learn how to fight ?
" how do i learn how to fight ?
son , violence is a product of fear .
learn to truly love yourself
truly love yourself and the world will be yours .
0k .
get yourself up here !
all right !
good morning .
good morning !
um ...
how much are they paying you to be here ?
er ...
excuse me ?
what' s your name , son ?
gerald .
well , gerald , i think you' re afraid .
do you want us to buy your book ?
because that was the worst advice ever .
see how sad this is ?
want your sister to lose weight ?
tell her to stop eating twinkies and play field hockey .
no one knows what they want to be .
it takes time to find that out .
right , jim ?
and you ...
yeah , you .
sick of some jerk shoving your head down the toilet ?
well , lift some weights or take a karate lesson , and next time kick him in the balls .
son ...
see this ?
this is an anger prisoner , a textbook example .
prisoner .
do you see the fear , people ?
this boy is scared to death .
son , it breaks my heart to say this , but i believe you' re a very troubled and confused young man .
you are searching in all the wrong places .
you' re right , actually .
i am pretty troubled and pretty confused .
and i' m afraid , really , really afraid .
really afraid , but i ... i ...
i think you' re the fucking antichrist .
it' s amazing .
he thinks he' s telling the truth .
everything he says is a fucking lie .
everything he says !
everyone thinks he' s so rad .
he' s such a fucking chud ...
are you 0k ?
sit down .
calm down .
you ever hear of grandma death ?
who ?
the philosophy 0f time travel " .
what is this ?
she wrote it .
i' m ...
i' m seeing stuff ...
like really messed up stuff .
that book describes stuff i' ve been seeing , and it can' t just be a coincidence .
she must be in .
she never leaves this house .
maybe she' s asleep .
donnie , look .
send her a letter .
each vessel travels along a vector through space time , along its centre of gravity .
like a spear .
pardon ?
like a spear coming out of your chest .
um ...
sure .
yeah .
in order for the vessel to travel through time , it' s got to find a portal , a wormhole or ...
could these portals ... ?
could these portals just appear anywhere , any time ?
i think that' s highly unlikely .
no , you' re talking about an act of god .
if god controls time , time is pre decided .
i' m not following you .
every living thing follows a set path .
and if you could see your path , then you could see the future ?
that' s a form of time travel .
well , you' re contradicting yourself .
if we were able to see our destinies manifest themselves visually , then we would be given a choice to betray our destinies .
the mere fact that this choice exists would make all preformed destiny come to an end .
not if you travel within god' s channel .
i' m not going to be able to continue this conversation .
why ?
i could lose my job .
0k .
it gives me no pleasure to deny you one of the great writers of the 20th century .
alas , i have not yet been elected queen of the universe , so i must obey the rules .
so , anyone seen in this school reading this book will be suspended .
not to worry .
someone pre ordered a dozen copies at the sarasota mall bookstore .
in mr greene' s absence , we will now be reading another classic " watership down " .
here , donnie .
pass these back .
maybe you and frank can read this one together .
now you know where he lives .
and they grow out of our ... chest , solar plexus ?
just like she described , the way they moved and they smelled .
it' s like they' re workers .
assigned to each one of us .
they just ...
they' re like liquid .
i followed it into my parents ' bedroom .
what did you find ?
nothing .
so we call them imgs .
infant memory generators .
you buy these glasses for your infant , and they wear them at night when they sleep .
but inside the glasses are these slide photographs .
each photograph is of something peaceful or beautiful , whatever the parents want .
what effect would it have on an infant ?
well , nobody remembers their infancy .
anybody who says they do is lying .
so , this will help develop memory earlier in life .
yeah .
did you consider that infants need darkness as part of their natural development ?
no .
yeah .
what if the parents put in pictures of satan or dead people ?
is that what you' d show your kids ?
er , well , i mean , didn' t your dad , like , stab your mom ?
get out .
gretchen !
gretchen !
gretchen .
i' m sorry about those guys .
two for " evil dead " , please .
that' il be $2 .
why do you wear that stupid bunny suit ?
why are you wearing that stupid man suit ?
take it off .
what happened to your eye ?
why do they call you frank ?
it is the name of my father .
and his father before me .
frank ...
when' s this going to stop ?
you should already know that .
watch the movie screen .
there' s something i want to show you .
have you ever seen a portal ?
burn it to the ground .
0k .
now , girls , i want you to concentrate .
failure is not an option .
and , bethany , if you feel the need to vomit up there , just swallow it .
0k , mom .
hey , you guys , good luck out there .
now , that was really something .
thank you , cherita chen , with " autumn angel " .
now the moment we' ve all been waiting for .
it is my pleasure to introduce to you emily bates , suzy bailey ,
samantha darko , beth farmer and joanie james .
they are sparkle motion .

# you own the money , you control the witness

# you pay the profits to justify the reasons

# that' s why i' ve done it again
# no no notorious ... #
how long was i asleep for ?
whole movie .
well , look what the cat dragged in !
how you doing , donnie ?
your little sister was broken hearted that you missed her big show last night .
dad ?
hm ?
i' m crazy .
you' re not crazy .
i used to be crazy .
but you' re not crazy .
look , you' re my only son ...
i know ...
no , hold it .
i know i' m not the best communicator , but ... .. whatever happens to you , be honest , tell the truth , even if they do look at you funny they will .
but what you gotta understand , son , is that almost all of those people are full of shit .
they' re all part of this great big conspiracy of bullshit .
and they' re scared of people like you .
because those bullshitters know that you' re smarter than all of them .
you know what you say to people like that ?
hm ?
fuck you .
the blaze was extinguished sometime after 8 . 00 last night .
firefighters discovered what has been referred to as a kiddie porn dungeon .
cunningham , who has become a recent celebrity for his books , was arrested ...
0h , my god ! .. while at sarasota heights country club .
arson has not been ruled out as the cause of the fire .
now a group of cunning vision employees ...
dad played golf with that guy . .. vehemently denied the alleged link to a child pornography publishing circuit .
ln a vicious statement , connie attacked fire department officials , claiming a mass conspiracy .
i' m sorry , karen .
this is a progressive school , but we don' t feel your methods are appropriate .
what exactly about my methods are inappropriate ?
i am sorry that you have failed .
now , if you' il excuse me , i have another appointment .
you can finish out the week .
fuck !
good afternoon .
it' s a great pleasure to announce that the middlesex ridge school dance team has been invited to perform on " star search ' 88 " in los angeles .
i know now a terrible thing is coming .
what do you mean ?
the field , the field .
it' s covered with blood .
blood ?
don' t be silly .
all right .
it' s getting dark .
we should get back to the burrow .
back to the burrow ?
it' il come there .
it' s all around us !
stop it , fiver .
we' ve got to leave here .
when the other rabbits hear of fiver' s vision , do they believe him ?
why should we care ?
because the rabbits are us , donnie .
why should i mourn for a rabbit ?
is the death of one species less tragic than another ?
0f course .
a rabbit' s not like us .
it has no history books , no photographs , no knowledge of sorrow or regret .
i' m sorry .
don' t get me wrong , i like rabbits .
they' re cute and horny .
if you' re cute and horny , you' re happy .
you don' t know why you' re alive .
you just want to have sex as many times as possible before you die .
i just don' t see the point in crying over a dead rabbit ... who never even feared death to begin with .
you' re wrong .
these rabbits are the product of the author' s imagination .
he cares for them , so we care for them , otherwise we' ve just missed the point .
aren' t we forgetting about the miracle of storytelling ?
the deus ex machina ?
the god machine ?
that' s what saved the rabbits .
no , it was ridiculous .
i' il call you back .
rose .
kitty .
i' m sure you' ve heard the horrible allegations against jim cunningham .
i know .
something about a kiddie porn dungeon ... 0h , please , please !
don' t use those words !
it' s obviously a conspiracy to destroy an innocent man .
i' m spearheading the jim cunningham defence campaign .
rose , i have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning .
the girls have to leave for los angeles .
as their coach , i was the obvious choice to chaperone them .
but now you can' t go .
yes .
now , believe me , of all the other mothers , i would never dream of asking you .
but none of the others are available .
i don' t know , kitty .
it' s a bad weekend .
eddie' s in new york .
rose , i don' t know if you realise what an opportunity this is for our daughters !
this has been a dream of samantha' s and all of ours for a long time .
i made her lead dancer !
sometimes i doubt your commitment to sparkle motion !
elizabeth will be in charge .
she' il drive you to therapy .
and if you need anything , you promise me that you will call dr thurman ?
how does it feel to have a wacko for a son ?
it feels wonderful .
here ...
sorry !
here you are !
you guys are gonna win .
i know it .
so do i.
here' s the keys .
there' s food in the fridge and do not ...
mom , go .
you' re gonna miss your plane .
mom , i need ...
there' s nothing broken in my brain .
i know .
bye , donnie .
0k , go .
go !
hello , donnie .
it' s friday .
shouldn' t you be off with your friends , scaring old people ?
what' s going on ?
i don' t know .
that' s a good question .
i' m no longer your english teacher .
they fired me .
that' s bullshit !
you' re the only good teacher here .
thank you .
what' s " cellar door " ?
this famous linguist once said that of all the phrases in the english language , of all the endless combinations of words in all of history ,
cellar door " is the most beautiful .
cellar door .
i promise that one day everything' s gonna be better for you .
shut up !
i want to talk about your past .
no .
l want to talk about you and your parents .
they didn' t buy me what i wanted for christmas .
what did you want for christmas that year ?
hungry hungry hippos .
how did you feel , being denied these hungry hungry hippos ?
regret .
what else makes you feel regret ?
that i did it again .
you did it again ?
i flooded my school and i burned down that pervert' s house .
i only have a few days left before they catch me .
did frank tell you to do these things ?
i have to obey him .
he saved my life .
i have to obey him or i' il be left all alone .
and then ...
and then i won' t be able to figure out what this is all about .
i won' t know his master plan .
do you mean god' s master plan ?
do you now believe in god ?
i have the power to build a time machine .
how is that possible ?
how is time travel possible , donnie ?
time' s up , frank said .
when is this going to happen ?
soon .
what is going to happen ?
frank is gonna kill .
who is he going to kill ?
who is he going to kill ?
i can see him !
the sky' s gonna open up .
if the sky suddenly opened up , there would be no law , no rule .
there would only be you and your memories , the choices you' ve made and the people you' ve touched .
if this world were to end , there would only be you and him ... .. and no one else .
you can stop taking your medication .
they' re placebos .
just pills made out of water .
thank you .
donnie ...
an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of god .
you' re an agnostic .
an agnostic is someone ... who believes that there is no proof of the existence of god , but does not deny a possibility that god exists .
goodbye , dr thurman .
hey .
i got in .
i' m going to harvard .
hey , we should totally throw a party .
mom and dad are gone .
it' s halloween .
we could get away with it .
0k .
but it has to be small .
we got eggs , water balloons and a dozen rolls of toilet paper .
i stole four beers from my dad .
we got a keg .
keg beer is for pussies .
rose , this is lilian thurman .
it is important that you call me as soon as you get this message .
thank you .
you 0k ?
yeah .
my mom' s gone .
you want to come in ?
l0ve wlll tear us apart " by j0y dlvisl0n )

she didn' t leave a note and the house was all messed up .
but you' re 0k .
did you call the cops ?
yeah , they said i should leave the house and that i should go to a safe place .
i' m just so scared .
i keep thinking something awful is happening and ...
it' s my fucking stepdad , i know it .
i guess some people are just born with tragedy in their blood .
hey , have you seen frank ?
no , they went on a beer run .
lf you' re there , please pick up .
oh , well .
good news .
the girls got three and a half stars and are in the quarter finals .

dear roberta sparrow , i' ve reached the end of your book and there' s so many things i need to ask you .
sometimes i' m afraid of what you might tell me .
sometimes i' m afraid that you' il tell me this is not a work of fiction .
l can only hope that the answers will come to me in my sleep .
l hope that when the world ends ,
l can breathe a sigh of relief because there will be so much to look forward to .
