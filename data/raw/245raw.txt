i' m alive !
but i don' t know what you just said .

i said ...
i am not that easy to kill .
i couldn' t hear what you said .
it' s just too noisy .
okay , i' il shut up !
let' s take a rest now .
your cake is really delicious .
your coffin is so comfortable .
bye !
are you looking for trouble ?
that kiss was okay , but you' re not allowed to kiss me again .
what you said before ...
i heard everything !
is anyone home ?
miss momoko , what a coincidence to see you here .
mr. prada , i' ve brought you some papers to sign .
and i' ve brought you something else .
please wait .
this is the last chance !
i' il bite her neck .
and you can choose any position you like .
pulse , or inner thigh , or an armpit .
let' s bite her together , and then suck her blood .
i told you many times !
i don' t suck .
okay , i' il suck her blood and put it into a jar .
i' il serve you with a glass of it , okay ?
you used to serve it like that to me .
but that' s all over now .
forget the past !
i' m telling you for the last time .
i won' t suck blood .
i see !
you have fallen for that girl .
tell me , you think you' re fit to be a vampire ?
have you got what it takes to be a prince ?
are you qualified to succeed the throne ?
are you giving me a lecture ?
try to tell her tomorrow , tell her that you' re a vampire .
see if she' s generous enough to give you her blood .
why are you looking at me like that ?
is it urgent ?
i want to tell you what i am .
don' t turn your back to me .
i' il get angry .
let me be frank .
i am not a human being .
you' re certainly not acting like one !
how can you talk to me like that ?
i' m a vampire .
so ?
look at my eyes .
cool !
where did you get those contact lens ?
what are you yelling about ?
see ?
i want to suck your blood !
that' s not the right way to suck .
suck like this .
let me go !
off !
i know what you' re doing !
you want to dump me , right ?
i' m a vampire !
do you want to fall in love with a vampire ?
so what' s a vampire ?
can a vampire brush his girl off like this ?
i know !
you think i' m too sassy .
but most of the girls in hong kong are sassy !
don' t you believe me ?
go find another one .
if you dare !
i have some dogs at home .
i don' t mind having a vampire .
the only problem is that my brother may not like you !
i am a vampire , and a useless vampire , too .
what do you mean ?
i haven' t eaten for days !
what are you doing ?
i am taking you to find food .
you stay here !
it' s better for me to go alone .
be careful !
it' s time to eat .
something' s wrong , let' s run !
did you get caught ?
can you hear that ?
what is it ?
bats .
if there are bats around , it means vampires are around , too .
let' s run !
why is the hospital alarm ringing ?
has there been a robbery ?
i think it' s just a mistake .
i don' t think any thief would be stupid enough to steal from a hospital .
who knows ?
thieves are everywhere .
your car could even get stolen .
speak of the devil !
what' s the matter ?
who are you ?
i am so glad to see you again !
i saved you last time .
would you help us now ?
your friend is dying !
that' s right !
i think he' s dying !
he has to get to another hospital !
please take him there now .
but i have to take something to the hospital .
the " something " you have to take is him .
take him there now , or he' il die !
come on !
hurry !
let' s go !
please !
are you feeling bad ?
do you want to suck my blood ?
of course not !
i can treat your teeth like mosquitoes !
if you don' t eat , you' il die !

turn on the music now .
drink it .
come on !
i brought it for you !

i' il iron them from now on .
congratulations !
you' ve found someone you can love .
haven' t you fallen in love with someone too ?
he' s great .
he' s just terrific .
but sometimes , he' s not that good to me ...
the harder it is to fall in love with him , the more i love the feeling !
anyway , there is something missing !
so i just couldn' t fall in love .
what' s missing ?
that is ...
what is it ?
something is missing ...
he is the " thing " you and my brother hate most .
have you fallen in love with a vampire ?
but he' s a good vampire !
vampires suck blood and kill people !
how can that be good ?
he' d rather starve than suck blood .
he is really nice !
could you say something on our behalf ?
your brother and i are vampire hunters .
please help us !

i could tell you were really nice as well as pretty .
hey , how did you win my brother' s heart ?
watch this !
superstar !
can you do that ?
it' s terrible !
but your brother likes it .
no way !
he' s got special tastes !
he likes trashy girls , but they must be simple .
besides being simple , she must be ordinary .
do you have any better suggestions ?
does it work ?
how about this ?
can you do that again ?
my dear sister in law !
do you have a date ?
what do you think ?
you put on perfume !
we can go now .
do you like it ?
how pathetic to find a vampire living here , in a church !
now , where is the fifth prince ?
this is for you .
what is it ?
why is it black ?
vampires wear black wedding gowns .
really ?
well , you search over there , and i' il check over here .
why should i go there ?
what are you doing ?
let go !
don' t you love me ?
why did you let them go ?
they' re in love !
that' s my sister , and that' s a vampire !
what did we swear before joining the league ?
when i took my oath ,
i didn' t fall in love .
now , i know what love is !
once you love a person , you won' t care about anything .
you can tell that from what i' m wearing .
didn' t you promise you' d do anything for me ?
i' ve got it !
i' il wait for you here !
reeve , right where you are least expected !
good to see you again , old friend .
this is my room .
this is my bed .

just for sleeping ?
go ahead , well , it' s good to take a nap .
our beds are not just for sleeping .

are there other ways to use it ?
such as ?
well , chatting !
many people love chatting in bed .
haven' t you ever heard of " pillow talk " ?
no .
shall we try now ?

why don' t you talk ?
what' s up ?
someone' s here !
my dear sister in law , you' re home !
come with me now !
what' s up ?
your brother is in trouble !
he' s the only one person who can save your brother .
kazaf , how long have i waited for this moment ?
i didn' t come for you .
let reeve go .
you still dare to act like royalty ?
bow to me , and i may grant you an easy death .
you still need my blood ,
if i spill it myself , it' s worthless to you ,
let him go .
why should l ?
your friends have already gone to rescue reeve .
perhaps , i should free this one instead ?
reeve !
drop the knife and he shall be free .
no chance !
release him !
no ...
let him go !
reeve !
reeve !
it' s me !
i' m your sister , helen !
so i see you are stronger than your brothers !
reeve !
reeve !
gypsy !
