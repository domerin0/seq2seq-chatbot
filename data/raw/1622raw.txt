nobody knows where they got it .
got no kids , no one to leave all that money to .
you and me , we' re as close as any family they got .

oh , look !

here it is , honey .
here it is .
by the way ,
i hear these two were in some state nuthouse for 40 years .
got all their money from a big lawsuit or something .
but then there' s lots of stories about them .
who knows what to believe ?
just find out where they stashed all that money , okay ?

why not see what he' s selling ?
let me just show it to you .
what the hell for ?
it' s right behind my car .
what' s the good having money if you never spend it ?
trust me .
it could be the kid has a point .
yeah , well ... we' il see what the man' s selling .
then we shoot him .
good plan .
whew !
due to the ... unsettling nature of our previous encounters ...
i took it upon myself to search the world over for that ... that perfect item that' d be just right for two exuberant sportsmen such as yourselves .
and boys , well , i do believe i found it .
voil !
what is it ?
well , that right there is the sport of kings .
up till now , only heads of state have been able to afford a fine piece of equipment like that , and it is so simple to operate even this child could do it .
really ?
here .
i' il tell you what ... you step right up here and chunk that lever back on my signal , okay ?
go ahead .
wow !
the most powerful one on the market , and very reasonably priced , i might add .
well , that is the biggest waste of money i have ever seen in my entire life .
mister , you load up that contraption and get the hell off this land .
we' il take it .
oh no , you don' t !
i won' t have my children around this gun foolishness .
then leave !
come on , daddy , let' s go .
come on .
come on .
you know what happens when my feelings get hurt .
get in the car .
get in the car .
ah , ha
oh , suey !
pull !
pull !
pull !
uncle hub ?
don' t .
i tried to wake him once .
he nearly tore my head off .
leave him for a few minutes .
what are you doing out here so late ?
what' s wrong with him ?
well , a man' s body may grow old , but inside his spirit can still be as young and restless as ever .
and him ... in his day , he had more spirit than 20 men .
it looks like ... he' s looking for something .
mm hmm .
what ?
he' s looking for her .
who ?
what was her name ?
jasmine .
okay , tell me .
you want me to tell you the story ?
now ?
that would take days .
well , uh ...
hub was always too restless for texas .
he convinced our folks that he needed to go to europe , and i needed to come along .
that was the summer of 1914 .
i la like you .
extra , extra !
germany invades !
unfortunately , just as we arrived in france , so did the kaiser and the entire german army .
i wanted to go home , but hub said we should tour europe one step ahead of the germans .
and we did .
what a time that was .
there were these girls in toulon ... twins .
and they ... ... anyway , we eventually wound up in marseilles with passage booked on the last ship out of europe .
and hub , he decided that we should spend our last night enjoying the local nightlife .
three , three !
he made friends with these soldiers , and they bought us some drinks ... strong , strange drinks .
we woke up on a ship bound for north africa ... shanghaied .
shanghaied ?
yeah .
we found ourselves in the french foreign legion .
it' s all my fault , " hub said , but he told me not to worry .
he' d make sure nothing happened to me .
we fought many battles against overwhelming odds .
he saved my life countless times .
when the war was over , we both went our separate ways .
i ended up leading safaris mostly for writers and hollywood folk .
but that was too tame for hub .
he got commissions from the new north african governments , to put an end to the slave trade .
no one , slave trader or bedouin , had ever seen anything like this mad american who fought like 20 men .
hey !
what the hell are you two doing out here in the middle of the night ?
just enjoying the cool night air .
either one of you got a lick of sense , go to bed .
i' m a rolling stone from texas
rolling stones from the plains
i am a rolling stone from texas , boys
i long to be back there again
well , say , are you from texas ?
that' s what i' m wanting to know
' cause if we' re both from texas , boys
let' s bundle up our clothes and go ...
dear walter , how are you ?
found your uncles ' money yet ?
here i am at school in fort worth , my nose to the court reporting grind ...
damn it , brother , i' m not going anywhere looking like this .
look like a damn sharecropper .
we' re gardeners .
this is what gardeners wear .
i bought you some clothes too .
they' re in your room .
think how good all these vegetables are gonna taste .
peas , beans , squash , tomatoes .
yeah .
what' s this row ?
beets .
beets ?
and what about this row ?
potatoes .
potatoes ?
yeah .
wait one damn minute here .
what' s this row here ?
tomatoes .
tomatoes ?
yeah .
that' s lettuce , squash , sweet potatoes , carrots , bok choy .
bok choy ?
what is that ?
chinese cabbage .
hey , that row looks right .
yeah , well , this is corn !
all those seeds did look alike , come to think of it .
yeah , like corn .
boy ... that seed salesman sure saw us coming .
no , saw you coming .
corn , corn , corn !
nothing but corn .
corn .
corn .
by god , it' s here !
kid , help him unload .
we' il be right back .
careful , kid .
he' s a man eater .
is this the mccann place ?
we brought your lion .
king of the beasts .
terror of the jungle .
you bought a lion ?
a used lion ?
stand back , kid , you don' t want to get mauled and eaten .
what are you doing ?
brother , this is the best idea you ever had .
this lion head will sure look good hanging over our fireplace .
what fireplace ?
you don' t have a fireplace .
we' il buy one .
you' re gonna shoot it ?
well , be seeing you .
he' s in there , all right .
i don' t think this is very sporting .
kid , at our age , this is as sporting as we get .
walter , come here .
when i give the word , pull this .
pull !
hey .
come on out of there .
hey , you in the crate !
get your lion butt out of there .
looks awful tame .
this lion' s no good .
it' s ... it' s defective .
it' s alive , that' s the main thing .
go ahead and shoot it then .
no , it wouldn' t be sporting , shooting it inside a crate .
looks kind of old ... worn out looking .
some kind of lion hunt this is .
perfect .
a reject .
some sick zoo castoff .
so can i keep him ?
i' il look after him and take care of him and feed him and everything !
i never had a pet of my very own before .
so kid , you want to take care of it , nurse it back to health ?
good .
then we shoot it .
that' s some lion you bought .
that' s some garden seeds you bought .
don' t worry , they' re not as bad as they seem right at first .
i' il be right back with supper .
there .
now you can see out .
you sure he can' t get out ?
she .
it' s a girl lion .
i named her jasmine .
what did you just say ?
it seemed like a good name ... for a lion .
i' m sorry it took awhile to come in .
in 40 years , i never had a call for it .
purina lion chow .
i' il be !
if you wait a few minutes , my boys will load you up .
i got it .
garth , pay the man .
be careful .
mr. mccann , those are bags that weigh 50 pounds a piece .
take the other end .
here we go .
if you two old ladies want to get in , i' il take you home now .
hub !
psst !
psst !
little boy !
you' re with those mccann brothers ?
i know that they' re ex mafia hit men .
they' re on the run with millions that they stole from al capone .
tell me more about africa ... about you and uncle hub and jasmine .
why would a smart kid like you want to hear hokey old stories ?
what else do we have to do ?
where was i ?
no one , slave trader or bedouin , had ever seen anything like this mad american who fought like 2 0 men .
yeah right , right , right .
well , it so happened ... one of the women that hub freed was handmaiden to a princess .
when she told her mistress the story of her rescue , most of all , she told her about the handsome , heroic american .
i must meet this man !
the princess said .
one day , hub was riding his horse along the mediterranean , when out of nowhere , another rider came up alongside .
but you know hub ... he wasn' t about to let a chance pass .
it became a race .
most people say that hub was the best rider in north africa .
but this other rider kept neck and neck as the race went on and on .
then the two horses collided .
the riders went flying into the sea .
hub leaped to his feet ready for anything ... or so he thought .
this was the princess , the most beautiful woman he had ever seen .
jasmine !
jasmine .
many people say there' s no such thing nowadays , it' s something you only find in stories , but when these two set eyes on each other for the first time , this was honest to god , no kidding , sure enough , once in a lifetime ,
love at first sight .
wait a minute .
if it was true love they would' ve been married and lived happily ever after , right ?
aren' t you getting ahead of the story ?
okay , keep going .
well ... things weren' t easy for them back then .
she was promised to another man , a powerful sheik in a neighboring kingdom .
he heard that jasmine was in love with another , so he threatened her father , and took jasmine off to his kingdom and locked her up in his harem .
she told the other wives that she would rather die than marry this heartless sheik .
she had a knife on her .
and when he came for her that night , she was going to slit her own throat .
what did uncle hub do ?
they got married , and lived happily ever after .
the end .
but wait , if they lived happily ever after , then they got married , and she' d be here right now with us , right ?
didn' t they have kids ?
where are they ?
nurse ?
what' s going on ?
i wish they' d tell us something .
get out of my face !
where' d you put my damn pants ?
where' s my pants ?
you can' t do that !
gimme my pants !
who put me in here ?
who put me in here ?
you two !
hospitals ...
lot of good they are .
how would you know ?
you' re never in one long enough to find out .
hey , you missed the turn .
i did not .
home is that way .
i wanna go this way .
doctor , where is mr. mccann ?
oh , i' m afraid he' s gone .
well , he led a long full life .
where is the body ?
no , he' s gone ... left .
mr. mccann checked himself out .
left ? !
brother , someday you' re gonna have to start acting your age .
what the hell does that mean ?
all your life , you' ve never been frightened of anything .
so what' s eating at you now ?
getting old ?
dying ?
hell no .
what then ?
being useless .
when we were young there was always a reason , there was a point .
things made sense .
now there' s no point to anything .
so what do we do ?
we garden .
we outlived our time , brother .
go get some beers .
all right .
hey , old man , how' s that barbecue ?
give me some .
we' re busy , boy .
get lost , all right ?
what did you say ?
here' s a perfect example of what i' ve been talking about .
since this boy was suckling on his momma' s tit , he' s been given everything but discipline .
and now his idea of courage and manhood is to get together with a bunch of punk friends and ride around irritating folks ... too good natured to put a stop to it .
hey , who do you think you are , huh ?
just a dumb kid , hub .
don' t kill him .
right .
i' m hub mccann .
i fought in two world wars and countless smaller ones on three continents .
i led thousands of men into battle with everything from horses and swords to artillery and tanks .
i' ve seen the headwaters of the nile , and tribes of natives no white man had ever seen before .
i' ve won and lost a dozen fortunes , killed many men and loved only one woman with a passion a flea like you could never begin to understand .
that' s who i am .
now , go home , boy !
we' il show these old bastards who' s tough !
get out your knife .
yeah .
now , boys , you' re fixing to let those teenage hormones get you into a world of trouble .
damn it , garth .
did i ask you to butt in ?
hub , you just come out of the hospital .
well , there' s ... there' s only four of ' em .
yeah , but ...
look , you fight this one first .
and then i' il let you fight the other three after , okay ?
yeah .
watch this , kid !
now you !
you better pick that knife up ,
' cause , son , you' re gonna need all the help you can get .
come on , frankie !
get him .
get him , frankie , cut him !
ahh !
shoot , oldest trick in the book .
okay , okay .
you hold it wrong , son .
not like this .
you always do it like this ... smooth .
try it again .
come on , frankie .
come on , frankie , get him !
cut him come on .
okay .
get him , frankie , cut him .
yeah , you got him !
frankie , come on !
stop , stop , ahh !
you' re breaking his arm !
you three had better get in there and help him .
why aren' t you helping him ?
hub always hogs the bad guys .
he' s selfish that way .
but there' s four of them !
three of them .
go on , hub !
hey , there' s my boy !
like this , kid ?
pretty good , huh ?
couldn' t you share ?
nah .
after 40 years , i' m used to it .
ahhh !
besides , right now , i figure he needs them worse than i do .
go on , hub !
this' il hold him though .
this' il hold him .
please !
please !
they' re not back yet , daddy .
i' m sure with hub just out of the hospital , they' re taking it slow and easy on the way home .
yeah .
oh , i hate this house .
i hate it .
when those two finally drop dead ,
i want you to burn this place to the ground , daddy .
hey , what' s that ?
beats me .
let' s tear it up !
yeah .
what is it ?
it' s stuffed !
mom !
mom !
he' s alive !
what ?
what happened ?
i told you about those lies of yours .
no !
hey , don' t step on my shoes !
what have you done with uncle hub ?
kid , get some meat .
where' s uncle hub ?
oh , lord , there' s been an accident .
i wanna go home now .
you' re in no shape to go home now .
it was a fight .
uncle hub won .
it was great .
ahh !
the lion really did try to eat us .
shush .
jasmine ?
oh jasmine !
i haven' t fed her all day .
i bet she' s really hungry .
i got to go feed her .
here , here !
here you go , jasmine .
jasmine ?
there really is a lion .
lion ? !

it' s locked up .
no it isn' t .
it tried to eat us .
it really tried to eat us .
get the guns !
get out of the way .
get the guns .
come here , come here .
jasmine ?
jasmine ?
jasmine ?
jasmine ?
come on .
oh !
eew , lion spit .

come on .
whoa !
they' re gone .
we might be too late .
move in .
you stay .
stay .
jasmine !
stop , stop .
attack him !
she' s feeling a lot better .
get off of me !
we' re leaving .
we are not coming back until you get rid of that monster .
well , the lion stays .
all right , that' s it .
come on , daddy .
daddy !
come on !
bye , uncle hub .
bye , uncle garth !
shut up .
get in the car .
i need a drink bad .
i' m having a bad day .
you boys hungry ?
wanna stay for supper ?
what are we gonna eat ?
meat .
a lotta meat .
she won' t come out of the cornfield .
this cornfield' s the closest thing to a jungle she' s ever seen .
she knows this is where she belongs .
i think she' s happy .
i think she is .
what about you ?
you happy ?
what' s he saying to them ?
he' s giving them his " what every boy needs to know about being a man " speech .
a lot of men have heard that speech over the years .
a lot of men .
will he give that speech to me ?
oh , i guarantee it .
assuming he' s still around , of course .
hey , you didn' t finish that story about uncle hub and jasmine .
you don' t believe all this africa stuff ?
it' s a good story .
well , after he rescued jasmine , several years passed , wonderful years .
never were two people so happy , so in love .
it was perfect .
except for one thing .
the sheik .
the sheik .
he hated hub for stealing jasmine , so he put a price on hub' s head .
10, 000 pieces of gold ... a fortune .
assassins came from miles around .
come on !
he and jasmine had to be on guard every minute of every day .
hub knew he and jasmine couldn' t run forever , that sooner or later their luck would run out .
there was only one thing to do .
so one day an assassin led hub , bound in chains , into the sheik' s fortress to claim his 10, 000 pieces of gold .
what ? !
they gave the assassin bags and bags of gold as the sheik ordered hub down to the notorious dungeon of 1, 387 tortures .
what kind of greedy , no good scum would turn in uncle hub for money ?
well , i would .
ah , it was a trick .
yeah , it was a trick .
in the dungeon , i drew my sword ...
and single handedly slaughtered everyone in there and freed hub without dropping a single gold coin .
wait a minute , wait a minute .
you saved uncle hub , all this time carrying hundreds of pounds of gold ?
you don' t believe i killed all those men and saved hub ?
well , hub might' ve helped just a little .
uh oh .
we were greatly outnumbered .
we fought against incredible odds .
and when it was over , we split up .
each one knew what the other had to do .
high in his opulent bedchamber , the sheik slept .
he awoke with hub' s sword across his throat .
the sheik was terrified , but hub just lowered his blade .
defend yourself !
hub cried .
and he threw the sheik a sword .
the sheik knew that he would surely die now , without even the right to beg for mercy .
but hub just said ,
twice i have held your life in my hands , and twice i have given it back to you .
the next time ... " ... your life is mine .
and from that moment on , the assassination attempts stopped .
some say it was because the sheik was afraid that hub would return and kill him .
others said because hub had spared his life , the sheik did the honorable thing and let his enemy live .
personally , i think it' s because the sheik was so damn busy once they discovered oil in his kingdom .
he became one of the five richest men in the world .
what ? !
the bad guy gets filthy rich ?
what the heck kind of story ends that way ?
i just told it the way it happened .
bye .
so long .
so that' s how you got all your money ?
the gold from the sheik ?
well ...
yeah .
those young men' il be okay now .
will you ?
yeah .
i feel old and worn out .
you' ve been busy .
yeah .
terrorizing doctors and nurses , beating up teenagers , chasing after lions ... you' ve had a full day .
lucky those boys don' t know diddly squat about fighting .
won' t be long till the kid here can whup my ass .
won' t be long till i' il be helpless in a fight .
useless !
you' il feel better in a day or two .
yeah , well ...
i' m going to bed .
good night , kid .
so ... you finally gonna tell me what happened to jasmine ?
nope .
what ? !
you wanna know what happened to jasmine you' re gonna have to ask him .

are you crazy ?
look what happened last time .
i' m tired of doing all the dirty work around here .
if you wanna hear the end of this story , you' re gonna have to ask him .
hub ?
yeah ?
an airplane ?
yep , always wanted one .
you always said you' d never set foot in an airplane .
you don' t trust them to fall right out of the sky .
they' re dangerous , all right , plenty dangerous .
you got a book of instructions or something ?
yeah , right here .
you don' t know a damn thing about airplanes .
well , i' m gonna learn , i tell you .
aha !
it says right here ,
to descend , push forward on the stick .
i' il have this thing up in the air in no time .
whoo !
damn .
maybe it' s just a new hobby .
maybe he doesn' t really mean to ... you know , do something crazy .
you think so ?
you ask him yet ?
about jasmine ?
you' d better make it quick .
what the hell ?
it' s the middle of the night .
what' s the matter ?
what are you doing here ?
you got something to say to me ?
spit it out .
what happened to her , uncle hub ?
what happened to jasmine ?
i have to know .
i have to .
she died .
died in childbirth .
her and the baby .
what did you do ?
went back to the only life i knew ... back to the legion .
for the next 40 years , there was always one more war to fight .
then i got old and came here .
here i am .
here i am .
you cold , son ?
you' d better ... here .
you' d better ... you' d better go inside .
good boy , thank you .
good boy .
those stories about africa ... about you ... they' re true , aren' t they ?
doesn' t matter .
it does too .
around my mom all i hear is lies .
i don' t know what to believe in .
if you want to believe in something , then believe in it .
just because something isn' t true , no reason you can' t believe in it .
all right .
there' s a long speech i give to young men .
sounds like you need to hear a piece of it .
just a piece .
sometimes the things that may or may not be true are the things that a man needs to believe in the most .
that power and money , money and power mean nothing ;
and i want you to remember this , that love ...
true love never dies .
you remember that , boy .
you remember that .
doesn' t matter if it' s true or not .
you see , a man should believe in those things , because ... those are the things worth believing in .
got that ?
that was a good speech .
think so ?
thanks .
yeah ...
when are you gonna give me the rest of the speech ?
when you' re almost a man .
you promise ?
wait one minute here .
wait ...
i can' t be a good man until you give me the rest of the speech , right ?
you need to stick around until i' m old enough to hear the whole thing .
i see what you' re trying to pull .
you have to stick around
until i' m old enough ...
i' il write it down .
no !
i want you to give me the speech !
you won' t be living here then .
you' re my uncle .
i need you to stick around and be my uncle .
what about uncle garth ?
he needs you .
w what about the dogs and the pig , and the lion ?
we all need you .
i need you .
no , you' re just being silly .
no , it' s true !
you' re being silly .
it' s true !
i know you miss jasmine an awful , awful lot .
but if you go , we' il miss you just as much .
it' s true .
all right , damn it , you win .
i' il stick around and be your damn uncle .
don' t expect me to be happy about it .
all right ?
deal ?
oh hh !
ohh , ohh .
you' re a good boy .
you' re a good boy .
you' re a good boy .
walter , walter !
get ready .
walter !
this money look stolen to you ?
try to help you
i can' t do it all by myself ...
try to help you
i can' t do it all by myself .
oh , honey , you' re so funny .
no !
whoop !
oh !
shh , quiet !
mom !
hi , honey .
walter , walter , this is stan .
i' ve heard a lot about you , walter .
your uncles still sleeping ?
best not wake ' em up .
shh , come on .
wanna go sit down ?
you got so big .
so stan here is a detective .
a real private eye just like in the movies .
wow , really ?
sure , sure .
you wanna see my badge ?
stan works in las vegas .
how about that ?
what about court reporting school ?
oh , i had to quit .
stan wants me to stay home and be a wife and mother .
won' t that be wonderful ?
i bet you found out where your uncles hid all that money , huh ?
why do you want to know ?
walt , your uncles match the description of two bank robbers from the ' 20s and ' 30s .
no , you' re wrong .
when mae told me about them ,
i got copies of the reports and showed them to her .
it' s them , honey .
they used shotguns .
they wore disguises .
they stole all that money .
and they shot people ... innocent people .
no , not them .
it can' t be .
stan knows what he' s talking about , honey .
what about jasmine ?
she and uncle hub were in love .
they ...
i have her picture .
honey , wasn' t jasmine the woman who was driving the getaway car ?
oh , right .
oh , jasmine ... she was wounded .
and they just drove off ... and left her for dead .
i know this hurts , son .
but they' re criminals , and they lied to you .
my poor baby !
oh , in the arms of vicious criminals .
we came just as soon as we found out .
we' ve come to take you away .
now , i want you to tell stan where the money is , then we' il go pack your things , okay ?
why do you need to know where the money is ?
look at me , son .
because it doesn' t belong to them .
it' s stolen .
why , it' s probably hidden right outside here somewhere , right ?
close by ?
i' il tell you what , why don' t we take a little walk , huh ?
show us around the place .
what do you say ?
let' s go .
well , walt , your mother and i found a nice house .
don' t have enough money for the down payment though .
we could always turn your uncles in for the reward money , but they' d go to jail .
since all that money' s stolen , honey , we got a right to it just as much as they do .
we' il have a nice family and nobody gets hurt .
isn' t it wonderful , walter ?
it' s what we always wanted .
so where is it ?
they' re old , they' re gonna die soon anyway .
you want uncle sam to end up with all that dough ?
just tell us .
hub and garth didn' t rob any banks .
they were in africa .
africa !
oh , walter , be serious .
really !
they were shanghaied into the foreign legion , and had adventures for 40 years .
they couldn' t have robbed any banks !
come on , pal .
you don' t believe all that , do you ?
sure , i do !
you ? !
mr. doubting thomas ?
here stan' s got actual evidence and you believe that africa crap ? !
yes .
yes , i do .
mae , you should go wait on the porch .
we' re gonna have a little chat , man to man .
why don' t we talk in the barn ?
what do you say ?
come on !
getting warmer ?
huh ?
no , let go !
let' s you and me get something straight .
we can be friends or we can be enemies .
i' ve had a run of crummy luck lately .
i know some bad people who want to cause a lot of trouble for me .
i need that money and i know it' s close .
i' il be damned if some snot nosed kid is gonna stand in my way .
so what' s it gonna be , pal ?
friends or enemies ?
defend yourself .
huh ?
where is it ? !
where' s the money ?
where is it ?
where is it ?
where is it ?
tell me where it is !
tell me where it is !
where is it ? !
i heard some noise .
oh god !
jasmine ?
oh my goodness !
oh my goodness !
stan !
it' s dead .
oh my god , he' s dead !
stan' s dead !
no , he' il live .
i' m talking about the lion .
oh !
we have to get him to the hospital .
mae , get your car .
i can' t , i can' t !
mae , your car !
get it , get it !
okay , okay .
let' s get this lion off him .
okay .
this man' s gonna need some stitches .
a lotta damn stitches .
what happened to her ?
it looks like her heart gave out in all the excitement .
yeah .
she was plenty old , you know ?
look ...
i think she' s smiling .
yeah .
i guess she died happy .
she died with her boots on , that' s the main thing .
protecting her cub .
she was a real lion , wasn' t she ?
there at the end .
sure .
a real jungle lion .
a real africa lion .
you finished packing ?
your momma' s gonna be back from the hospital soon .
you can wait for her on the front porch .
stay right here .
don' t you move a muscle .
so you all packed ?
where' s your suitcase ?
don' t be fresh .
upstairs in my room .
well , let' s go get it .
howdy , stan .
you know , you' re lucky , stan .
lucky that lion got to you before we did .
i wonder what your uncles are saying to stan .
probably their " what every boy needs to know about being a man " speech .
well , i' m glad to see they' re making friends .
so you all set ?
let' s go .
to make a long story short , stan , you and me , we can be friends ... or we can be enemies .
well , boys , i hope walter wasn' t too much trouble .
we managed .
what' s gonna happen to him ?
a man like that' s got no business being around your boy .
well , of course not .
what kind of a mother would i be ?
i' m gonna drop him off in las vegas .
l ...
i' il be back for the ... rest of that speech if ...
i' il be here .
good boy .
thanks for the s stories and everything .
it ... it ... it meant an ... an awful , awful lot .
i' m glad .
well , come on , honey .
we' re burning daylight .
damn .
she doesn' t deserve that kid .
maybe we should get a lawyer .
no judge is gonna take a child away from its mother and give it to two old bachelor uncles .
maybe she' il sell him to us .
how much money we got ?
hub ... there' s nothing we can do .
he' s gone .
so where are we going ?
i told you , las vegas .
i mean after .
after we drop stan off .
well , honey , stan' s gonna need a lot of looking after .
walter !
what are you doing ? !
oh my god !
walter !
walter !
walter , stop !
stop right there !
what' s gotten into you ?
oh , honey , are you all right ?
you gave me a heart attack .
you' re still marrying him after everything .
oh , he' s not so bad .
a little rough around the edges , but he can change .
mom !
he says he loves me .
has he hit you yet ?
mind your own business !
you always think a new boyfriend solves everything , but you always pick losers , and he' s the worst of them all .
walter , i had no choice .
maybe you don' t .
what ?
mom ?
what ?
do something for me .
for once .
do something that' s best for me .
okay ?
salesmen ought to be here in two , three hours .
whoop de doo .
uh huh .
lookie yonder .
okay , if i' m gonna live here , there' s gonna be some conditions .
conditions ?
one , you two gotta stick around until i' m through with high school at least , preferably college .
you both got responsibilities now ...
pta , boy scouts , little league , the works .
sounds like we don' t have much choice .
two , you both gotta take better care of yourselves .
more vegetables , less meat .
i wonder if traveling salesmen sell school supplies ?
and three , no more dangerous stuff .
no fighting teenagers , no airplanes ...
now wait one minute ...
at least till i' m through with college .
maybe longer .
what do you expect us to die of ?
old age ?
well ...
welcome home .
hello ?
walter ?
yes ?
this is sheriff grady .
i' m afraid i have some bad news for you .
it' s about your two uncles .
i' m sorry , they passed away .
there was an accident ... and it' s a blessing that they didn' t suffer .
it' s a blessing too , in a way , that they went together .
you understand .
i' m over here at your uncles ' place now .
you need to come on over here .
you need to see this for yourself .
walter ?
how you doing ?
all right .
best i can figure , they were trying to fly through that barn upside down .
had a bunch of reporters out here earlier , even cnn .
i guess any time a biplane ... from the first world war crashes doing acrobatics , being flown by two 90 year old men ... neither one of them with pilot' s licenses ... well ... well , they had a good long run , both of them .
they went out with their boots on .
here .
i found their will .
the kid gets it all .
just plant us in the damn garden ... with the stupid lion .
hey !
we' ve got some company .
this is it .
this is where they lived .
it' s okay .
come here , buddy .
come here .
look at this .
look at this .
forgive me .
we were in houston when we heard their names on the news , and , well , we just had to come .
when i was a boy , my grandfather told me such stories .
your grandfather ?
a very wealthy sheik .
he used to love to tell me stories about his wild youth .
amazing , unbelievable stories all about two brothers ,
hub and garth mccann , the most valiant and brave men , huh ?
he called them his " most honored adversaries .
the only men who ever outsmarted me .
wait , so you ... you knew these two men ?
they ... they raised me .
it' s an honor .
nice to meet you .
it' s nice to meet you .
wow .
aha .
i see they spent my grandfather' s gold wisely .
yeah .
well , there was this one traveling salesman .
so ... the two men from great grandfather' s stories , they really lived ?
yeah ... they really lived .
i' m a rolling stone from texas
rolling stone from the plains
i' m a rolling stone from texas , boys
i long to be back there again
well , say , are you from texas ?
that' s what i' m wanting to know
' cause if we' re both from texas , boys
let' s bundle up our clothes and go ...
they say a rolling stone never gathers no moss
as long as it' s rolling along
oh , but i don' t care if i gathered any moss
if it' s in my texas home
i' ve got a little girl a waiting
her name is patricia jane
and i' il never be happy till i' m by her side
out on those west texas plains ...
