i' m looking after the flat .

they were in a car crash .
you' ve always lived in lille ?

i' il push the barrier .

that' s clear enough !
wait , i' m asking for permission .
you think i want to fight ?
fredo , it' s for you .
you want to get in ?
yes .
i' il tell you why it isn' t possible .
the people playing music ... they' ve worked hard , they' ve come a long way , they have to be paid .
we want to see them .
the rental of the hall , none of it' s free .
are you paying them ?
no , i' m not paying them .
and there are technicians , too .
two people , two girls !
who' il notice in the crowd ?
i will !
and you' re interrupting me .
interrupting ?
we' re talking !
what' s your problem ?

she' s mad !
we can' t use this .
what' s the matter ?
we don' t need girls like you !
you don' t know how to work .

tell me what' s wrong .
we can' t use this .
it' s a waste !
stop it !
what' s the problem ?
take your jacket and go !
take your jacket !
look , she' s sewn them inside out .
what is this ?
everything' s inside out !
you' re occupying a machine when lots of women are waiting .
what is this ?
stop using the machine .
all right , i' m going .
go .
you' re losing us money .
to hell with this job .
i' m not going back .
no , it' s work .
you have to go .
have you seen how he treats us ?
shut up and sew !
you can stay at the flat .
at least we' ve got that .
i can ?
do you have money saved up ?
no , nothing .
when i have no money , i sell cards .
look .
i make them .
i sell them for 10 or 20 francs .
to people in the street ?
yes , you make up any old story .
i' il give you some .
i don' t beg .
it' s humiliating .
why , it isn' t humiliating .
when people refuse ?
you move on .
look , fredo , our two little dodgers .
no one told you to sit here !
we sit where there' s room .
by the way , which one of you called me fat last night ?
fat ?
fat .
i heard the word " fat .
i don' t know .
not us .
really ?
not you .
hi , fredo .
hi , luis .
what about manu ?
drop manu , will you ?
get the message ?
what are you doing tonight ?
couldn' t we work at your concerts ?
hear that , fredo ?
what would you do ?
i don' t know .
look after the singers .
what do the girls do ?
there aren' t any girls .
at concerts , you drink the wine , load the trucks ... and anything that moves gets jumped on .
you don' t know what you' re in for .
you' ve never been in the shit ?
who , me ?
you let him jump you to get this job ?
you' re lucky you' re a chick !
don' t talk like that to fredo or he' il do you !
he mustn' t talk to marie like that .
she' s just getting the wrong message .
i never said i wanted to do you .
who are you anyway ?
just a bouncer .
you can' t get us a job .
all on your own !
i' d like to see in 15 years how you end up !
you think we need you ?
don' t bother coming to any concerts .
you' re banned .
the master of the world !
calm down .
this is our table .
get lost !
keep calm , fredo .
he' il land you one if you keep insulting him .
i' m not insulting you .
what is this ?
enough !
we haven' t even introduced ourselves .
charlie .
marie .
charlie .
isa .
fredo .
fredo , he said .
can i come in ?
i' ve made breakfast .
cool .
shall i put it here ?
what time is it ?
it' s 12 : 00 .
shit .
have you eaten ?
no .
join me , then .
shall i open the curtains ?
i' d been working for a week .
he didn' t seem to be interested in me .
one day when he wasn' t expecting it , i jumped on him .
he was having a nap , and bam !
it was a house i was redoing down south .
he was living with his mother .
she was great .
she was a painter .
she was doing great stuff .
i ended up almost living with them .
then we finished the job .
during the last days , i didn' t know whether to talk to him or not .
whether he wanted me to stay or for it to end like that .
we never talked about our feelings .
it wasn' t easy .
and then , on the last day , i packed our gear with the mason .
and i didn' t know what to do , and the fool still said nothing .
so , i said good bye to him like to the others .
i walked to the truck ... and at each step i hoped he' d tell me to stay .
he let me get into the truck ... and that was that .
later i regretted not saying anything .
it wasn' t up to you .
you wouldn' t have ?
no .
it was a stupid ending .
it wasn' t your fault .
if he' d wanted , he' d have asked you to stay .
maybe he was afraid i' d invade his life .
maybe if i' d had my own place it would have been different .
he slept with you because you were available .
a girl on the road .
it was practical .
maybe he was waiting with each step for me to turn around .
we' il never know .
you' re torturing yourself , and you dream a lot .
have you got a guy ?
don' t you like the bouncer ?
are you crazy ?
you were in his bed !
i didn' t think you' d screw him .
i didn' t screw him .
we drank , you went to sleep .
what about fredo ?
he fancies you .
no , thank you !
i don' t like him .
he freaks me out .
he' s weird .
charlie said they don' t only do the concerts .
they' re also bouncers for this club , the blue .
he gave me his number , but i won' t call .
i don' t get stuck on guys .
they get on my nerves .
you' re not answering ?
no .
it' s for them anyway .
been to see them in the hospital ?
i don' t know them .
i got the flat through my aunt .
besides , they' re in a coma .
both of them ?
yes , i think so .
have you settled in ?
do what i did .
just move her stuff .
but what if they come back and i' m here ?
we' il see .
we' il say i' m your cousin from brittany .
you' re putting me up .
all right .
i am starting this diary on a sunny day .
like a mirror for me to know who i am .
i feel things inside , overwhelming things .
i feel my pulse beating .
i' m confused , nervous .
like something missing , a desire ...
i can' t yet control .
on the edge of an abyss , i feel this crazy urge to jump .
what are you doing , for christ' s sake ?
it isn' t a pancake , it' s a ..
classy !
it' s not a sword fight !
you need practice .
do you like them ?
yes .
the woman painter gave them to me .
i didn' t expect her to .
take one .
but they were a gift !
go ahead .
i swear .
i want you to have one .
choose the one you prefer .
it' s yours .
this one .
it' s yours .
thanks .
we' il find you another .
one with a car .
we' il go for a long ride .
anyway , we' il have a drink .
let' s see .

he' s too old .
wait , marie .
he' s super sexy .
there' s one !
he' s too good looking !
hello .
i need to talk to you .
sorry to bother you , but i have a message from my friend , marie .
she' s been following you for several months .
she' s shy , but she knows everything about you .
you' re a great guy and you' ve got a lot of money ... but she' s shy and comes from a more modest background .
these things happen .
she wants to know if the little detail of class matters ... or if it' s love that counts .
i' m sorry , i' m in a hurry .
marie , she' s pretty .
pretty name .
like in a fairy story .
look at the way he walks !
he' s uptight .
let' s follow him .
come on , run !
wait , i' ve got something to tell you .
open the window !
we' re looking for a chauffeur for the afternoon .
sorry , it' s my day off .
just a little ride .
i' ve just cleaned my car .

i see !
i get it .
you sort out the good from the bad .
that' s right .
and you' il let us in ?
how much is the admission ?
if we let you in , we' il be left out here on our own .
that' s not nice .
if you didn' t know me , would you let me in ?
not like that .
she could grow her hair , you could have yours done ... a little makeup , you wear a dress ..
try and look like girls .
what a job !
you just judge people by their appearance .
great !
not again !
if you want to go in , go in !
in that stuffy joint ?
i wouldn' t be caught dead !
here' s the boss .
shit !
the guy whose light i busted !
you' re right .
hi , fredo .
hi , charlie .
everything okay ?
yes , everything' s fine .
see you later .
he' s the boss ?
yes , he' s the boss .
some get an early start !
he' s young .
that' s true .
what did he do to own this place ?
easy .
he was born into it .
see the grande brasserie over there ?
his dad owns that .
we' re free on thursday .
let' s hook up .
we don' t know what we' re doing .
you don' t know .
we' il call you .
yeah , like last time .
good bye , boys .
good night .
yeah , right , good night .
walk in the light !
is marie there ?
yes , she' s in .
i' m her mother .
hello .
come in .
shall i get her ?
your mum' s here .
why are you here ?
i was in lille .
i tried to call earlier .
you could say hello .
i wanted to see the flat .
as you can see , it' s a flat .
it' s okay .
let' s go down to the cafe across the street .
wait .
isa , we' re just going for a drink .
i came on my own .
he can' t get about easily .
sure .
let' s go .
let' s have lunch .
all right .
remi , i love you .
does remi know how to say " i love you " ?
remi has blue eyes , white legs , a scrawny neck ... cauliflower ears and a willie the shape of ..
woke up expecting something to happen .
nothing .
excitement .
she' il bring him here and they' il screw .
she' il say , " hush !
sandrine' s sleeping .
what a bummer , my mother with a guy like that .
if i put a carving knife ... under her mattress , he won' t be able to get an erection .
i' ve come to see sandrine val .
which ward ?
i don' t know .
she' s in a coma .
neurology then .
professor delacour' s ward .
take the lift , second floor , corridor b.
ask for the nurses ' office .
she' s unconscious , she can' t communicate .
she can' t talk or move .
she won' t answer you .
we' re watching for any sign of her waking or of an improvement .
spend some time with her .
if the sound of your voice triggers off a sign ...
let me or one of the nurses know .
it' s very important .
her mother died a few days after the accident .
doctor , please ?
excuse me .
i' il be right back .
hello , sandrine .
you' ve eaten well again .
visits seem to give you an appetite .
i' il make you comfortable .
there you are .
you' il catch cold like that .
the tips of her fingers are always cold .
she still has a slight temperature .
are you a relative ?
one of her friends ?
yes .
guess what i' ve just done .
lent my mother 1, 000 francs .
christ !
i' m broke and i have to give her money !
because she' s married to a jerk !
your father ?
yes .
she says he wants to see me again .
has it been a long time ?
four years , since i left .
she seems fine .
she isn' t nice , she' s a victim .
it' s different .
did you notice ?
she never looks you in the eye .
do you still see your parents ?
my mother .
when i can , or i write .
i get on well with her .
what does she do ?
she works in a shoe factory in valence .
and your father ?
they only stayed together a year .
my father married again and had other children .
i went to live with them for a while , but i went back to my mum .
it was cooler with her .
you' re lucky your parents separated .
mine stayed together .
maybe in four years your father' s changed .
my father' s mad , that doesn' t change .
now he' s really sick so he' s calmed down .
what did you do today ?
i visited sandrine at the hospital .
her mother' s dead .
she' s still in a coma .
they don' t know how long the coma can last .
she could stay like that and grow old on her bed .
i' il go back and see her .
what for ?
she doesn' t seem to get any visits .
it might do her good .
what a drag !
if her mother' s dead , we' il get thrown out .
those of you who' ve just arrived , fill in the forms ... and attach your photos .
think of your favorite star , lauren bacall , dietrich , garbo ..
if you' ve already been a waitress , say where and for how long .
two on the photo .
how can we tell who' s who ?
who' s isabelle tostin ?
there are two on the photo .
i' m isabelle tostin .
you worked at the dukes , like marie thomas .
you' re ms. thomas ?
you' re inseparable , like lovebirds .
does the idea of working at the hollywood make you feel like stars ?
yes , absolutely !
who' s your favorite star , isabelle ?
madonna .
madonna , okay .
could you do something like madonna ?
yes .
like in concert ?
like on tv ?
all right .
or " like a virgin .
okay , very good .
marie , who' s your favorite star ?
no one .
i just came with my friend .
you must have a favorite star .
yes , marie , lauren bacall .
she doesn' t know me well enough .
you said lauren bacall .
lauren bacall , go on , marie .
there you are , lauren bacall .
all right .
you aren' t very affectionate , are you ?
i am .
well , you' ve had me .
you should be glad .
yes .
why do you say that ?
you' ve had me , too .
well , no .
what do you mean , no ?
i don' t want you .
so you make love to a guy you don' t fancy , is that it ?
you just screw around .
that must be it .
with all of them ?
i didn' t expect to end up in your bed .
i didn' t expect to end up with a fat guy .
a fat guy .
i don' t think of myself as fat .
it' s just a question of vocabulary .
you okay ?
what about you , not flattened ?
did you sleep with fredo ?
he fancies you a lot .
are we going ?
on the bikes ?
shit , my scarf .
what are you doing ?
i' ve forgotten my scarf .

very old , tall trees .
the sound of the river hidden beneath the brambles .
the black crows ... their yellow beaks .
the fresh air stinging our cheeks .
february 18 .
sunshine at last .
school excursion to honfleur .
we left all together .
i felt completely with the others .
at one with them .
i was lau , i was marc , i was remi .
