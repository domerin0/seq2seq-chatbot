i got out of the institution on the day of my sister' s wedding .
i' d started to get used to the place ... breakfast at 8 : 00 , classes at 2 : 00 , therapy at 4 : 00 and asleep by 10 : 00 .
you can call me anytime , lee .
i will always try and be of help to you .
inside , life was simple .
thank you , dr. twardon .
for that reason , i was reluctant to go .
bon voyage .
come on kiss her , kiss her .

watch this , huh ?
avoid the temptation of placing your fingers on the home keys by sight .
strike each key so that your fingers bounce with each stroke .
do not strike without thinking .
do not even attempt to steai a glance at your paper .
' my flowers had just about given up in despair , so with the exception of a few potted plants from the florist , we' re flowerless for the first spring in years . '
and ... time .
i' m so proud of you , honey ... being out in the world like this .
when my accident happened we were in the kitchen and my back was to her .
upstairs , my dad was just leaving for work at havis department store .
because there was a limited amount of time that my mom' s back was turned ...
lee !
i slipped and cut too deep .
i' m not sure how i could have misjudged .
i' ve been doing it since 7th grade .
just a precaution .
' be a leader . '
i have never had a job before .
but i can assure you that i am very excited about this opportunity .
thank you .
oh ... well ...
i don' t have any references yet .
but i think that the municipal tax office would be a wonderful place ... to begin ... my career .

i want to be bored .
i have a part time paralegal .
all i need is a typist , who can get to work on time ... and answer the phone .
i can do that .
we only use typewriters here , not computers .

peter called .
some people have to wash something ... as soon as they' ve worn it for like half a day .
yes .
and then you got ... your more laid back folk , who will wash this stuff when it' s dirty .
which kind are you ?
i' m the type of guy ... who wants to get married and have a kid .
i wash my clothes just when they' re dirty .
me too , and that is what counts in a relationship .
compatibility .
in a relationship ?
in a ... relationship .
may i interest you in a little more ?
just a little more ?
why not ?
okay .
you' re different than you were in high school , peter .
i' ve changed .
what happened ?
i had a nervous breakdown .
me too .
sort of .
tom , i have this and these .
peter ?
yes , lee ?
i' ve read that if you wear that kind of underwear that it squeezes ... your ' thingies . '
balls ... my balls ?
yes .
my ' grapes ' ?
your grapes .
my ...
your testicles .
your sperm gets ' squozen ' and then you can' t have babies ... and i thought that you said that you wanted to have babies .
there you go , i said it .
to babies .
diapers .
diaper rash .
breast feeding and crying .
vomit .
look at it .
do you see that ?
what ?
this letter has three typing errors in it , one of which is , i believe , a spelling error .
i' m sorry .
this isn' t the first time , either .
there have been others that i let go ... in the first few weeks .
this cannot go on .
do you know what this makes me look like ... to the people who receive these letters ?
i' m sorry .
type it again ... and get it right .
you' re wasting my time .
bye .
go type up a bill for that woman for $500 .
aren' t you going to proofread the letter ?
lee ... when people come into this office , ... you are a visual representation of my business ... and the way you dress is disgusting .
sorry .
you' re tapping your toe all the time and playing with your hair .
you' re either going to have to wear a hair net or stop playing with your hair .
and another thing ... do you realize that you are always sniffling ?
i' m sniffling ?
and what is with your tongue ... when you' re typing ?
i' m sorry , i didn' t know i sniffled .
well , you do .
' mr. grey ... thank you so much for your helpful suggestions .
because i am trying to be ... the very best secretary that i can be for you . '
the sentence should read , ...
' without proper guidance from a knowledgeable source , ... my client would never have made ... these material decisions on her own . ' period !
i have repeated the sentence ...
are you sure you wouldn' t like some wine ?
we make it homemade , don' t we , stewart ?
try it , it' s good .
would you like some , lee ?
no , thank you .
not right now , sylvia .
peter talks about you all the time .
he says he' s found his soul mate .
did you say that ?
i did .
peter' s sister lindsey ... is getting married this coming winter in vegas .
did you know peter has a very stable job at j. c. penney ?
they even gave him a cell phone .
perhaps it' ii be a double wedding ?
mom ...
ms. holloway .
come into the library ... immediately .
' ... the remarks made in print , ... in summation of the events in regard ... to the rubin berkowitz libel .
yours sincerely , ' etc .
okay .
the phone is ringing .
answer it .
i' m sorry ...
brr ing !
brr ing !
oh .
brr rr !
' hello .
this is the office of ... '
listen ... you' re a big girl .
you can get a much bigger voice out of that tiny throat of yours .
tiny ?
ms. holloway , ... you told me when i hired you that you were used to answering phones .
i am .
did you get enough sleep last night ?
i ...
the phone is ringing .
' hello ... this is the office of mr. e. edward grey . '
you see ?
you see ?
that' s showing a little spunk .
i' m not running a mortuary .
no .
lee .
mr. grey ... ?
come here .
did you have a date recently ?
yes .
with whom did you have a date ?
peter .
peter .
did you have sex ?
no ?
i don' t know .
are you shy ?
i' m shy .
you' re not shy .
you' re a lawyer .
i' m shy .
i overcome my shyness ... in order to get things done .
i don' t think you' re shy .
lee , i' m going to be frank with you .
i know i' m your employer ... and we have a proscribed relationship ...
but you really should feel free ... to discuss your problems with me .
what' s going on with the sewing kit and the band aids ?
lee ... ?
i feel ...
shy .
do you want some hot chocolate ?
okay .
why do you cut yourself , lee ?
i don' t know .
is it that sometimes the pain inside has to come to the surface ... and when you see evidence of the pain inside ... you finally know you' re really here ?
then when you watch the wound heal it' s comforting , isn' t it ?
i ...
that' s a way to put it .
i' m going to tell you something .
are you ready to listen ?
yes .
are you listening ?
you will never ... ever ... cut yourself again .
do you understand ?
have i made that perfectly clear ?
you' re over that now .
it' s in the past .
yes .
never again .
okay .
now , you know what i want you to do ?
i want you to leave work early .
you' re a big girl ... a grown woman , ... your mother doesn' t need to pick you up every day .
i want you to take a nice walk home , ... in the fresh air , because you require relief .
because you won' t be doing that anymore , will you ?
no , sir .
good .
oh , it' s early .
mom ...
i' m going to walk home from now on .
i took a shortcut through hawkins park , ... and it was as if i' d never taken a walk by myself before .
and when i thought about it , ...
i realized that i had probably never had taken a walk alone .
but because he had given me the permission to do this ... because he' d insisted i do it , i felt held by him as i walked along .
i felt he was with me .
at the same time i was feeling something growing in mr. grey ... an intimate tendril creeping from one of his darker areas , ... nursed on the feeling that he had discovered something about me .
the next day i didn' t even bring my cuticle scissors and my iodine ... but i did make another typing mistake .
what is wrong with you ?
that is all you have to do ... type and answer the phones .
is that beyond you ?
i' m sorry .
it certainly seems to be .
i' m sorry .
don' t apologize to me .
what goes on inside that head of yours ?
come into my office and bring that letter .
put the letter on my desk .
i want you to bend over the desk so you' re looking directly at it .
get your face very close to the letter and read the letter aloud .
i don' t understand .
there' s nothing to understand .
put your elbows on the desk ... bend over ... get your face close to the letter and read it aloud .
' dear mr. garvey , ...
i' m grateful to you for referring ... '
continue .
ms. holloway , read .
' ... for referring me to your case .
the subject of animal captivity ... has been of interest to me for quite a while , ... and my secretary has prepared ... research material ... that i think you will find illuminating .
if you would be so kind ... as to send me the june 5th ietter of which we spoke , ... my associates and i will review it immediately .
please feel free to call me at your earliest convenience .
yours sincerely , e. edward grey . '
read it again .
' dear mr. garvey ... '
' i am grateful to you ... '
' for referring me to your case .
the subject of animal captivity has been of interest to me ... '
' ... for quite a while .
and my secretary has prepared research material ... that i think you will find illuminating . '
now straighten yourself up and go type it again .
ms. holloway ?
good letter .
mom ?
the lock can come off the cabinet now .
oh , honey .
replace the light bulb in the hallway to my office .
120 watts .
mr. grey .
good to see you again , mr. garvey .
you remember my secretary , ms. holloway .
i' m sorry about the typo .
it' s porterhouse steak , mashed ... no ... creamed potatoes , green peas , iced tea and ice cream .
okay .
just a scoop of creamed potatoes ... and a slice of butter .
four peas ... and as much ice cream as you like to eat .
' cosmo' s ' advice for ' getting your man ... to share his feelings more intimately ' is to first try some ' breezy humor . '
whatever you do , don' t jump too quickly into ' relationship talk . '
i' m your secretary .
i' m your secretary .
just one scoop of creamed potatoes , one slice of butter ... oh ... and four peas ...
how many inches away was the furnace ... ?
had you turned off the furnace before you went down into the basement ?
okay ... maybe you didn' t squeeze it hard enough .
there' s always concern about it bursting .
no , god no .
i haven' t had time to get to that .
i' m doing as much as i possibly can .
where was she when you crawled under the house ?
and the lock box ?
did you cover it with dirt before you left ?
mud upstairs ?
no , i' m confused by that .
ah , but ... this was the overweight child or your nephew from baltimore ?
on the banister .
i have to work .
okay .
give me a week and i' il have something for you .
i' m sorry , the office has been ... overwhelmed .
mr. grey , i' m going to go home now .
if you need any more typing done i could come back later .
thank you , ms. holloway .
good night .
that will be all .
oh , here' s just one example .
he asked me out to red lobster the other night for a nightcap .
and yesterday he asked if my hose were control top ... and if they were , i certainly didn' t need it .
your boss ?
yeah .
you should sue him for sexual harassment .
i like that idea .
hello ?
my lawyer is representing a woman who' s suing her boss for sexual harassment .
is he a good lawyer ?
he' s the best .
' he' s the best . '
how long will he be there ?
who was that ?
he checked himself into the hospital .
lee ... ?
yes , lee ?
hi .
i ...
i just wanted ...
i needed you ...
i wanted you to ...
you need me to what ?
i just wanted you to not forget to go over the lynch papers for tomorrow .
no , i haven' t .
that' s good .
thank you , lee .
after he turned me away from his house , ... he put me back at my old desk and he just stopped doing it .
he threw out all his red pens .
i kept making typos ... but he just treated me like a regular old secretary .
are you coming ?
after a while i began to wonder if that was all i was .
have we received any checks from mr. garvey ?
no , sir .
file these .
that' s a pretty tie .
but i guess you won' t be golfing today .
what ?
your tie ... it has golfers on it .
right .
damn it .
don' t be scared .
i' m not .
that' s not what i meant .
i' m sorry .
look here , see ...
i' m sorry .
okay ... but my clothes get to stay on and i want the lights out .
i didn' t hurt you , did i ?
no .
ms. holloway ?
yes , mr. grey ?
come in to my office .
but mr. marvel is waiting .
ms. holloway , come in to my office .
yes , sir .
finally .
ignore it .
now pull up your skirt .
why ?
you' re not worried that i' m going to fuck you , are you ?
i' m not interested in that , not in the least .
now pull up your skirt .
lee ... ?
lee ?
i said , pull up your skirt .
peter ?
i' m not going to be able to come to the diner today , okay ?
okay .
that' s okay , ' cause ... it' s all right .
pull down your pantyhose and underwear .
i told you i' m not going to fuck you .
get these forms filled out .
and then you can take your lunch break .
bring me my sandwich , i' m eating in .
and ... go have the usual .
no mayonnaise this time .
and ... send in what' s his name .
okay ?
mr. grey .
cock .
place your prick in my mouth .
screw me .
oh shit .
fuck .
mayonnaise .
orchid .
oh , mr. grey ... !
edward .
most people think that the best way to live is to run from pain .
but a much more joyful life ... embraces the entire spectrum of human feeling .
if we can fully experience pain as well as pleasure , ... we can live a much deeper and more meaningful life .
ms. holloway ?
yes , sir ?
bring your typing scores .
okay .
what happened ?
are you pregnant ?
no .
do you plan on being pregnant ?
could i ...
you plan on getting pregnant ?
no .
are you living in an apartment ?
a house .
alone ?
with my parents .
are you married ?
no .
are those your scores ?
yes .
do you really want to be my secretary ?
yes , i do .
this isn' t just about typos , tape , staples and pencils , ... is it , lee ?
no , sir .
what ?
no , sir .
i like you lee , but i don' t think i' m going to offer you the job .
why ?
it' s your behavior .
what about my behavior ?
it' s very bad .
i' m sorry .
you can collect your things .
time out .
time out ?
you' re fired .
you' re fired !
you' re fired !
now , lee .
get out !
why did you get glue smear all over the ramsey papers ?
because i was fixing your shredder .
you saw me .
are you aware you kick your shoes off under your desk ?
i can smell your feet .
do you ever change your pantyhose ?
every day .
every time you erase ... there are little shavings all over your desk .
i told you to take that walkman home .
i don' t want the possibility of your listening to music ... when you' re supposed to be working for me .
i saw it in your desk ...
i know it' s there .
i' il move it .
you have to go or i won' t stop .
don' t .
i cannot do this anymore .
but i want to know you .
i' m so sorry for what happened between us .
i realize what a terrible mistake i made with you .
and i can only hope that you understand .
be assured you can count on me for excellent references .
get out .
get out .
what are you do ...
get out !
i opened the envelope the second i got home .
it was a check for $680 .
more than he actually owed me .
it occurred to me to tear up the check , but i didn' t .
i felt like i was doing the right thing .
and i didn' t tell anybody about any of it .
i pretended to go to work as usual , ... and watched his office from across the street .
he hired a new girl and changed the locks on the doors .
there was just nothing for me to do about it .
my doctor at the institution once said , ...
' every journey begins with the first step . '
so i decided it was time to meet someone new .
there was one who tried to grab and pinch my nipples ... before we even made it to his car .
hi .
another guy kept ordering me to pee on his patio ... and when i refused , he said ...
i thought you were a masochist .
then there was the one who liked being tied to a gas stove ... while the burners were on full blast .
i had to throw tomatoes at him .
thank you .
for a while i stopped trying and stayed at home ... helping dad adjust to his new sobriety .
until one day , out of the blue , ...
peter proposed marriage to me in the basement of j. c. penney' s .
i think i said yes because i didn' t know what else to do .
i guess i was a little lighter than you in those days .
okay .
if you hold your breath through the wedding , you' il make it .
don' t move .
i' m going to get stewart .
you' re beautiful , you' re just too beautiful .
lee ... ?
no !
i' m not supposed to see you before the wedding .
where are you going ?
i have something to say to you .
lee .
i love you .
lee , you should not be here .
i love you .
i' m sorry , i ... but i don' t believe that to be true .
well , it is true .
it is .
this matter was resolved ... when i received your canceled severance check .
i love you .
we can' t do this 24 hours a day , seven days a week .
why not ?
put both your hands on the desk , palms down .
i want to make love .
keep both your feet on the floor until i come back .
hello ?
in case you' re wondering , ... your fiance is at my office .
lee , i' m very fond of you as well ...
oh , it' s you .
lee , what are you doing ?
lee , i don' t ...
i don' t know how to deal with ...
i' m sorry , i' m going to have to ask you to leave .
i' m your fianc , lee .
you are trespassing .
you are making an unwarranted incursion ... a gradual or stealthy entrance into the sphere of another .
okay , lee ... are you doing something ... sexual , right now ?
does this look sexual to you ?
i don' t know , lee !
why don' t you move your hands ?
because i don' t want to .
no !
peter ...
i don' t want you .
now , get out .
get out .
get out !
i brought you some peas .
there are no statutes capable of controlling ... the relations between men and women .
there are other ways to show your feelings , lee .
more conventional ways .
i expect that dress back , dry cleaned , in perfect condition .
i' m just going to leave you with this literature .
why don' t you read about women' s struggle first ?
you know , lee , ... there' s a long history of this in catholicism .
the monks used to wear thorns on their temples .
and the nuns wore them sewn inside their clothing .
two years ago when it didn' t work out between us , that was it .
i let him slip through my fingers .
you are part of a great tradition .
i admire you , ms. holloway .
without question , he is the most isolated man i' ve ever known .
the worm ... amazing .
who' s to say that love needs to be soft and gentle ?
' you are the child of god' s holy gift of life .
you come from me , but you are not me .
your soul and your body are your own , ... and yours to do with as you wish . '
thank you , daddy .
drinks .
take what you ordered .
don' t take anybody else' s drink .
what you ordered .
we are here on day three of what has come to be known ... as the ' lee holloway hunger strike . '
you may have heard ... that there are those in the community who wonder ... if ms. holloway is even willing to starve herself to death .
' in one way or another , i' ve always suffered .
i didn' t know why , exactly .
but i do know that i' m not so scared of suffering now .
i feei more than i' ve ever felt , ... and i' ve found someone to feel with , to play with , to love , ... in a way that feels right for me .
i hope he knows that i can see that he suffers too , ... and that i want to love him . '
each cut , each scar , each burn , a different mood or time .
i told him what the first one was .
i told him where the second one came from .
i remembered them all .
and for the first time in my life , i felt beautiful .
finally part of the earth .
i touched the soil and he loved me back .
where did you go to high school ?
what was your mother like ?
what was her name ?
what did it say ... under your senior yearbook picture ?
who was your first iove ?
when did your heart ... first get broken ?
where were you born ?
des moines , iowa .
all our activities melted into an everyday sort of life ... until we looked like any other couple you' d see .
pull it over , yes .
just pull it tight .
now these pillows like to be stacked ...
largest to the smallest .
we had a june wedding , by ourselves , at the justice of the peace .
then we honeymooned in the mountains .
we only had the weekend , because edward had to get back to work .
