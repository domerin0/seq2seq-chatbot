henry , it' s 1 : 00 .
i was drumming for an idea .
yeah .
i heard .
jason , sit down .
sit down .
and after an arduous disembowelment procedure ... ... the body was hauled off to a marshy area ... ... placed atop a large pyre , where it was slowly devoured by vultures and rodents ... ... while the tribe looked on and danced .
a man dies , he' s gotta serve his tribe .
you don' t have a tribe , henry .
yes , i do .
you' re my tribe .
you and the boy .
and sky there .
aren' t you , sky ?
keep looking for your funeral idea ... ... because your tribe is not dancing while rodents eat you .
jason .
i want us to go on a trip .
i know you do , henry .
yeah .
one last dig .
we' il fix up the van .
what ?
it' s a perfectly good ...
it' s not perfectly good .
it' s a classic .
there' s nothing wrong with that van .
look , i' il see you in the morning , all right ?
i may not make it to the morning .
well , wake me up before you kick so i can tell you what i really think of you .
hey .
something' s different about my nanny .
she' s a nurse .
well , whatever she is , she gave me a woody .
goddamn it .
well , i guess that' s natural .
well , of course it' s natural .
i didn' t say an alligator came out of my ass .
good night , henry .
yeah ?
how can you watch this ?
they relax me .
in denmark , we didn' t have horror .
henry asked for your father again .
we should find him .
i don' t know how to do that .

she is the mother of that bloody person .
family is important at death .
good night , katrina .
good night .
dad .
papa henry' s drumming again .
come on .
hey , dad ?
are we gonna make papa henry into a mummy when he dies ?
did he tell you that ?
no , we' re not gonna make him into a mummy , zach .
are we gonna stuff him ?
henry .
what do you want ?
come out of there .
a priest wore that 1000 years ago .
where' d you get it ?
i stole it .
stole it right out of the goddamn ground .
that' s what an archeologist does .
can we not advocate theft until he' s at least old enough to drive , please ?
nonsense .
some things want to be stolen .
the lair family have a history of thievery , zach .
it' s nothing to be ashamed of .
now , banking , there' s a shameful occupation .
jason .
can i see you ?
what is it ?
your father is downstairs .
he wants to cross threshold .
what ?
threshold .
do you think the drumming made him come ?
who ?
your father .
you' re jason .

excuse me ?
i got your letter about henry .
i sent it four years ago .

nipple is funnier .
nipple is funnier .
yeah .

of course you can .
we' il fix up the van .
one last dig .
all of us .
but i' m catching a bus in the morning .
a bus ?
where to ?
you just got back , son .
i mean ... ... you just got home .
i can' t stay , henry .
you' re not ready .
you' re still on the stairway .
zach , i' m serious .
give it to me .
it' s bedtime , zach .
are you glad your dad' s not dead anymore ?
he never was dead , zach .
are you happy to see him ?
sure , i am .
henry .
some of us ... ... are more broken than others .
what are you talking about , henry ?
a family carries each other .
i carried you .
you carried me .
we have to carry him .
leave me .
what just happened ?
i don' t know .
well , what did you and henry just talk about ?
i told him i had to leave .
leave when ?
in the morning .
i' m catching a bus .
it got him upset , i think .
okay , jason , i go see him .
your bed is ready .
you and the boy go to the zoo a lot .
yeah , we go on sundays .
every sunday ?
usually .
what do you do ?
i work at a bank .
i mean at the zoo .
can we not do this ?
henry wanted to see you before he died , but i don' t feel like ... ... filling in the blank of my life before your bus .
they' re all dicks .
if they stay or go , if they' re mean or nice .
we' re dads .
we' re dicks .
it' s not our fault .
he' s not my father .
why did he leave ?
i have no idea .
he just left ?
my mom and i were in this car accident when i was 2 .
that' s how i hurt my leg .
she died .
afterwards , turner just shot dope around the clock ... ... till he finally just disappeared .
and then he showed up today .
after 30 years ?
fuck .
he' s still your father .
would you stop saying that .
he' s your father .
he' s not my father .
henry is .
maybe .
luke , join me .
come to the dark side .
george lucas didn' t make that up .
that shit happens .
can i get a shot for my friend yoda here , please ?
i need your help , boy .
what' s albuquerque ?
it' s where we' re going , son .
only ... ... that' s gonna be our secret .
okay ?
i need your word , zach .
good lad .
sit down .
hello ?
what ?
they' re where ?
they' re coming , sir .
go back to sleep , zach .
the boys are coming .
the boys are coming .
zach .
so , what' s with the bag ?
what' s in it ?
i don' t know .
chicken , i guess .
henry wouldn' t have just given us chicken , turner .
i' d stay if i could .
be okay with all ...
all this ?
i' m sorry about henry .
and i' m ...
i' m sorry about earlier too .
i just ...
we haven' t exactly had time to sit down ...
is this about now ?
what ?
is it about now , because if it' s about a lot of ancient stuff ... ... we can' t do anything about , then i don' t want to discuss it .
do you like horror ?
no .
want coffee ?
no .
socially acceptable drug .
coffee .
ever do heroin ?
no .
that' s good .
you sure you don' t want coffee ?
no .
i made a pot .
what time is your bus ?
i' m gonna have to miss it .
this from henry ?
son of a bitch .
he did it .
that' s a will ?
yes .
and it' s very cogent too .
he even had it witnessed .
he' s got a cook ...
at a kentucky fried chicken stand , albert ?
come on .
their literature refers to them as restaurants .
and i think they prefer kfc , but anyway , it' s a cook ... ... and one of the customers , dorothy o' connor .
oh , henry .
she had the two piece box .
what' s she doing ?
there used to be a door here .
mom , this isn' t our apartment .
we live upstairs .
right here .
so , what' s it say ?
the will ?
as his lawyer , i can' t tell you .
why ?
why did you take the door away ?
what do you mean , you can' t tell me ?
this is jason' s place , mom .
this is not our apartment .
he wanted the will read after the funeral .
what funeral ?
turner' s letter deals with the funeral arrangements .
you got a letter ?
and you got a letter .
i didn' t get a letter .
you got a post it .
i got a post it .
is it cogent ?
no .
actually , it' s not cogent .
what' s it say ?
what does your letter say ?
some of it was private .
what does the not private part say ?
dear turner , this bag is to be opened at the kfc restaurant ... ... where we had our final meal as a family .
please bring the ashes with you .
also bring jason and zach .
i love you .
i' m sorry i' m dead . " signed , " henry .
they' re not even ashes .
they' re bones .
mom .
cremation ?
as far as i know .
except ...
they' re smashed up bones .
they should tell you that .
if you want to stay , you' re gonna have to behave .
except what ?
he wants to be with sky .
" with sky , " what ?
cremated with him .
sky isn' t dead .
well , maybe he wanted you to kill the dog .
he is old .
come on .
we gotta go .
don' t worry .
we don' t have to kill the dog .
we' re not gonna kill the dog .
henry said he' s gonna die today .
sky ?
sky ?
first off , i would like to welcome you all to my funeral .
i wish i was there with you .
please begin by taking out the bag ... ... that is inside the bag you were given .
okay .
let' s see .
one , a pair of post its , one pink , one blue .
two , a map .
three , another bag .
the pink post it will tell you exactly where to make ... ... the first disposal of sky' s and my remains .
the blue post it will detail the ritual to take place there .
the map will direct you to the kfc establishment where you are to dine .
oh , my god .
" open the next bag and so on ... ... until there is nothing left of me .
i love you all .
henry .
it' s pretty clear , right ?
we shouldn' t do this .
i spoke to the people at the cemetery ... ... where henry already has a plot , next to your mother ... ... and they said they would be willing to intern henry and sky' s remains in the plot .
ring , ring , ring ...
zach .
i need ...
yeah .
hello ?
no .
barney , look , i' m in the ...
i can' t talk to him right now .
hello , sir .
tell him you' re in the middle of a funeral .
yeah .
tell him you' re at a funeral at kfc .
which post it was the first one ?
the pink , i think .
it' s top priority , and i' m going to go see them .
zach , please .
he wants us to start at my mother' s grave .
we aren' t doing it .
now , just give me one second .
i think it' s important too , sir .
can i , just , in two minutes ...
can i call you back ?
turner .
i' il take care of it .
where is he going ?
just wait here for me for a sec .
zach , i' m serious .
i want you just to stay here for two seconds , okay ?
zach , i' m not kidding .
i need you just to stay here .
turner .
we are not doing this .
i didn' t come here to deal with you .
well , now you have to !
now , you can' t take ...
let' s just go back inside and figure out something that works for everyone .
okay ?
tell zach i' m glad i met him .
you too .
he wants you to know , mom , that he thinks about you every single day .
turner .
and that he ...
he' s sorry about the change in plan .
ashes .
and he wanted to sing you a song .
oh , my god .
he wanted you to have this .
and this is from me .
turkey sandwich , extra mayo .
zach .
a little sky .
a little bit of sky .
jason .
come on .
come on .
come .
look , how long do you think this is gonna take ?
what' s the first stop ?
death valley .
how about a lift so we can pack ?
not necessary .
katrina has already packed you both .
you' re kidding me , right ?
where did you get this ?
it was a gift .
someone gave you a brand new ... ... sterling silver spoon as a gift ?
yep .
did you steal it ?
sometimes a thing wants to be stolen .
that' s right , zach .
it' s true .
how can i help you ?
oh , hello .
nice to see you .
how much is this spoon ?
that' s $ 199 . 50 .
it' s lovely , isn' t it ?
we' d like to pay for it now .
i don' t understand .
my father left here the other day without paying for it and we' d like to pay for it now .
but it was a gift .
from who ?
from me .
you know him ?
you know my father ?
we have mutual friends .
tell him .
we' re both in aa .
excuse me .
my name' s marion .
i' m an alcoholic , we met at a meeting .
hi , marion .
he told me about his father .
i recently lost mine .
anyway , your father didn' t have the money for the spoon we liked .
and i get a discount here , so i bought it for him .
you thought that was funny , didn' t you ?
kind of , yeah .
you did have a history of places like this .
i do .
yes .
just talk to him , barn .
look ...
what are you doing ?
i' m collecting .
hey , grandpa turner ?
yep .
why did you go away ... ... when my daddy was a little boy ?
did he do something to make you mad ?
no .
then why' d you go away ?
well , what' s it say ?
turner .
there' s a ranch near here .
it' s where my mother lived when henry met her .
i can still remember her ... ... standing there in the barn ... ... the warm sunlight behind her .
so young , beautiful .
her small , firm breasts shining ...
he doesn' t know what breasts are .
i know what breasts are .
titties .
this is ridiculous .
titties , he said titties .
no .
we don' t get to look at the map until after the dispersal part of the ritual .
fine .
let' s disperse .
come on , zach .
henry wanted us to share a meal before each spooning .
knock yourself out .
how far is the ranch ?
i' m not hungry .
the meal thing is part of the ritual .
he did not say we have to eat chicken at every single stop ...
don' t bitch to me .
i' m the vegetarian .
you thinking about a woman , zach ?
yep .
jason , how about you ?
yes .
who you thinking about ?
did the post it say " think about a woman , " or " talk about thinking about a woman " ?
tina turner .
tina .
that' s hot .
so , what are you and tina doing ?
you balling ?
what' s balling ?
it' s ...
zach , it' s ...
it' s playing catch .
you' re playing catch with tina ?
no .
no , we' re singing .
singing ?
what , you got a problem with that ?
no , it' s just not real sexy .
i didn' t hear " sex fantasy , " i heard " think about a woman .
who you thinking about , zach ?
alice , she lives next door .
she kissed me once .
she kissed you ?
zach heard " sex fantasy .
who are you thinking about , grandpa ?
louise pearce .
buck naked , in her mama' s car .
maybe alice will play catch with me naked sometime ...
okay .
just blow the ashes .
henry wanted us to listen to it loud .
only kidding .
shit .
we' il come back in the morning .
i' il wake zach , we can open the bags now .
we can' t do that .
why not ?
henry wants us to open the bags inside .
he said at a kfc stand , not in a kfc stand .
literature calls them restaurants .
fine .
right .
and you don' t eat at restaurants , you eat in restaurants .
you' re kidding me , right ?
no , i' m not .
okay , then how do you explain that ?
do the cars eat their chicken in , or do they eat their chicken at ?
i don' t know .
either way , they eat their chicken .
we cannot , because we don' t have any chicken .
and that' s why we' re not opening the bag out here .
excuse me .
excuse me .
hey .
we' re closed .
yeah .
look , can i talk to you for a second ?
the registers are closed .
we don' t need the register .
look , i' il give you 100 bucks for three drumsticks .
i' m sorry .
i say we make an exception .
no .
look , we' re just gonna skip one meal .
no !
why not ?
the place doesn' t open until 11 .
we' re here .
let' s get it over with .
what is the big deal ?
the big deal , it' s not what henry wanted .
you don' t wanna be here , i' il take you back .
i didn' t say i didn' t wanna be here .
then act like it .
you think you' re the only one whose life got interrupted by this .
i need this about as much as i need a bullet in my head .
i don' t know about you , but henry never asked me to do a thing ... ... in his entire life , and he asked me to do this , and i' m doing it !
not your way or my way , but his way .
are we gonna stop or are we gonna sleep in the van ?
i gotta pee .
but if you choose not to abide by henry' s wishes as he wrote them ... ... then the will names turner as the sole beneficiary .
of what ?
henry' s things .
the collection is worth about $ 220, 000 .
hello ?
you there ?
who gets the things if we do this ?
zach .
henry knew you wouldn' t do anything to deprive zach of his inheritance .
i don' t think that he ever cared much for you working in that bank .
it' s about time .
you guys really love your chicken .
you have no idea , man .
hey , has anybody seen my phone ?
damn it .
zach , you seen my phone ?
no .
goddamn it .
you' re kind of a tense person .
you get that from your mother' s people , i think .
pull the van over .
turner , pull the van over .
i don' t know what etiquette book you referenced before your homecoming ... ... but i don' t think they advise insulting people you left behind .
when did i insult you ?
you called me tense .
you called me thief .
you were a thief !
you were tense .
you still are .
okay .
fine .
maybe right now , at this point , i am tense .
that does not make me a tense person .
fair enough .
fair enough .
i was also a musician .
what ?
i wasn' t just a thief .
in case you wanna update your point of view .
yeah .
okay .
let' s update my point of view .
let' s update yours too .
what , are you kidding me ?
you show up here after , what , 850 years and think you get to decide ... ... what we get to talk about .
fuck you , man .
fuck you .
we' re not just gonna talk about the present .
so you can forget the part about walking out on your family ?
i didn' t forget .
this isn' t the first thing henry' s asked me to do .
he' s asked me to do a million things and i' ve been happy to do them .
so you don' t have the market cornered on helping henry .
there .
we updated ?
hey , dad ?
why did grandpa turner have to sleep someplace else last night ?
who' s that ?
that' s me .
i think that' s my mom .
what' s on the back of it ?
my boy .
did you go on digs with him ?
i wanted him to leave it all in the ground .
the pottery , the bones .
it didn' t belong up here .
but ...
... my father loved ... ... digging up old shit .
oh , excuse me .
i' m looking for henry lair .
he' s dead , so he can' t come to the door .
dead .
i' m sorry .
actually , i' m looking for his son , turner .
why ?
have we tried the extra crispy ?
did we like it ?
so how long will you be with us ?
just the night .
stop .
oh , that' s my grandpa henry .
he' s dead .
i recently lost my ...
ruth .
for god' s sake , ruth .
i should never have let her keep the thing .
it' s her brother .
every time she looks at him , this happens .
his own children didn' t want the damn thing .
why does she got to keep the ashes ?
it' s sick .
i didn' t ...
are you ... ?
you keeping yours ?
no .
good for you .
i mean , dead bodies are not meant to be ... ... inside of people' s houses .
it' s sick .
the keys , please .
oh , yes .
of course .
have a good night .
good night .
you know , i remember that .
what' s bullhead ?
kind of like this weird shark fish thing .
really ugly .
on your way , huh ?
yep .
listen , i wonder if you could do us a favor .
could you take this ?
take it for what ?
well , for , you know , scattering with ...
what' s it for ?
he' s bringing the ashes .
is it okay with your wife ?
it was her idea .
she , you know ...
ruth .
come here .
she just , you know , couldn' t ask you herself .
we' d really appreciate it .
put him anywhere .
just get them out of here .
he wants us to take the ashes .
for ?
you have a spoon ?
a spoon ?
maybe we should mix .
what ?
never mind .
we' ve been mixing the dog' s in .
the ashes are probably all mixed up together anyway .
i don' t know .
it' s not gonna matter .
okay .
take care .
bye .
you can' t find them ?
we have no reason to think ... ... turner' s dangerous .
he broke out of prison and he has my son .
he didn' t break out .
he walked out .
and i assure you we' il find them .
katrina , stop crying .
sorry .
are you going somewhere ?
yeah , my work is done now .
i go home to rhus .
a woman who slept with a fugitive .
you slept with turner ?
oh , dear .
well , it' s okay .
jason said i' m allowed to have boyfriends .
he' s ...
he' s not a boyfriend .
he' s jason' s father .
so ?
in denmark , people' s fathers can be boyfriends too .
thanks .
