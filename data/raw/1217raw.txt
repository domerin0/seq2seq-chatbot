what are you doing , harue ?
you' re dripping wet !
they went away ...
they' ve aii disappeared ...
they always do ...
i have to run away ...
run away somewhere ...
harue !
hey , harue !
listen , harue !
harue !
calm down !
harue !
thank you ...
i always wondered what it' s iike to die ...
from when i was reaily iittle ...
i was always alone
any parents or family ?
sure , but they' re irrelevant
right ...
that after death , you iive happily with everyone over there
can we stop talking about this ?
but it may be true
sure , but ...
then in high schooi it dawned on me you might be aii alone after death , too
there' s no way to know
how could you ?
the idea was so terrifying
i couldn' t even bear it
that nothing changes with death , just right now , forever
is that what becoming a ghost is about ?
you can' t mess with that it' s reaily bad
what have ghosts got to do with us ?
besides , we' re alive
then , who are they ?
are they reaily alive ?
how are they different from ghosts ?
in fact , ghosts and people are the same , whether they' re dead or alive
it' s not right .
it' s wrong
they' re aii crazy
nobody knows what happens when you die
aii this about ghosts , but i won' t believe in them , even if i see one
but i do know that i' m definitely alive and so are you , harue
that' s for sure , right ?
so i don' t want to think about the fact we' ii die someday
just maybe ...
in 10 years , or at ieast while we' re stiii alive , they' ii invent a drug that prevents death
then , we could iive forever and ever
of course you might think i' m crazy to say that , but ...
i' d rather bet on that
you want to iive forever ?
yeah
that sounds iike fun ?
yeah ... that' s what i think
huh ... maybe i' ve got it aii wrong
no ...
it' ii turn out just iike you say
i' m sure
what ?
ghosts won' t kiii people
because that would just make more ghosts
isn' t that right ?
instead , they' ii try to make people immortai
by quietly ... trapping them in their own ioneliness
help ...
help ...
junco , it' ii be ok
it' ii be ok
ok ...
i feii asleep ...
how do you feel ?
yeah
something to drink ?
how about some coffee ?
michi ...
what ?
am i just going to die iike this ?
of course not
that' s right ...
i' ii just keep on iiving , aii alone ...
what ?
no
junco !
junco !
junco !
junco !
why !
why !
junco , don' t go !
junco !
mother ?
mother ?
mother !
i' ii be right there
harue ...
harue !
hey ...
kawashima ... take me with you
i' m scared to be alone
take me somewhere
ok , sure
where to ?
somewhere far away
out of order
shit , iet' s just go !
there' s no one ...
no ...
where did everyone go ?
i' m here
i' m here beside you
even if , there' s no one else , it doesn' t matter
we are both definitely here
guess that' s true ...
what happened ?
i' ve got to go back !
what ?
no !
we' ve come this far !
but this is the end of the iine
that' s not true .
it' ii start moving
i' ii go check with the driver .
come with me
ok , but promise you' ii wait right here
i' ii be right back .
promise
harue !
the forbidden room
construction materials red tape
i' m ...
not alone ...
harue , it' s me , kawashima
harue !
listen !
listen , what do you say to this ?
the two of us iive together
that way , we can always be together
if we keep iiving alone , we' ii just get worse and worse because we' re weak
we' ii balance each other out
how about iiving that way ?
would you try it with me ?
what do you think , harue ? !
harue !
harue !
harue !
