nothing is necessarily what it appears to be .
stockholm , 22nd december , 1945 .
dear martin , i' ve long had this letter in my thoughts .
after some reflection i have decided to resign as literary critic with you .
it' s not about the publishing house .
you and bonniers have alwa ys treated me warmly and respectfully .
i' m grateful you allowed me to publish my own small works
even if they weren' t financially rewarding .
no , in that now the war is over and i have no family ties in sweden
i see the possibility of setting off for europe and trying new things .
make a difference !
create !
i hope that you , who know me so well , understand .
so , my brother , thank you for everything .
perhaps we' il meet again .
merry christmas .
your friend , gunnar wern .
p. s. concerning my last duty as reviewer
i can' t recommend that you publish mrs lindgren' s " pippi longstocking " .
the story strikes me as too bizarre and amoral .
possibly , one could create a children' s novel
with the somewhat intelligible characters , tommy and annika .
but to confide that task to a barely literate housewife is unadvisable .
no , a craftsman' s talent as a writer is required here .
no ... !
illumlnatlon a film about trains
i' m scared .
i love you .
will you also kill me the day you tire of me ?
i won' t get tired of you .
to kill one' s wife for the love of another ...
can god forgive that ?
god has forgiven hitler .
how do you know ?
i feel it .
i wish i had your faith .
you' il become catholic when we marry .
i thought they couldn' t remarry ?
not if they divorce , but if they become widowers .
marie , listen to me .
she is ill !
we' re sparing her years of suffering .
that' s what .
she won' t get better .
only sicker , more bitter and meaner .
i' m a doctor , i know .
why can' t you just get a divorce ?
you want us to get married .
she' il take half of what i' ve worked years to get together .
we' d live shabbily with our shameful love .
we' d never be respectable .
she' d shadow us like an avaricious phantom screaming for more money .
infecting our love , spreading poisonous rumours among our friends
until we only had each other to vent our sorrow and fury upon .
is that how you want it ?
no ...
this is how you want it .
this is what we want .
and we' ve earned it , haven' t we ?
yes , henry , we have .
what are we doing ?
we' re shortening one person' s life
so that two others can be happier .
isn' t that right ?
not after man' s laws ruled by money , but in god' s kingdom where love reigns .
what should i do ?
this is chlonedin .
it' s for migraines which my wife gets .
she takes them .
in small , normal doses it' s fine .
but just one of those tablets
contains as much as in a whole tin .
such a dose leads to feelings of euphoria followed by extreme fatigue .
especially combined with alcohol .
if a tired person having taken too much
falls from a train ... well that' s nothing more than a tragic accident .
but you prescribed her medicine .
i' m in stockholm when she takes it .
it' s not blood thirst , marie .
it' s gone too far .
i can' t even touch her .
i' m disgusted by her .
i don' t know whether i can do this .
do you love me ?
yes .
love conquers all .
believe me .
god will give you strength .
a little push and we' re free .
she won' t feel a thing .
she dies happy , we meet in berlin .
in berlin ...
and we' il have a child .
not here .
imagine experiencing all this .
being looked after .
it' s like being a film star .
little me .
but what a waste , it' s scandalous !
it' s typical of me .
i just help myself .
i have a weakness for luxury , that' s it .
i want to secretly taste the cream .
mum used to get so angry with me ...
it' s been awhile .
i' il have a big bag .
and some chocolate as well .
look , mum , real oranges !
imagine that !
could i ?
of course .
what a nice gentleman !
thank him properly .
thank you .
have a merry christmas .
who are these poor people ?
refugees from the baltic states .
eat something for everyone' s sake .
god has been at my side for the war .
he will be with me for this journey .
you are fantastic .
what am i doing ?
excuse me !
no , no , it' s just fine .
this shoulder usually pops out .
i' m so sorry !
no , it' s a scream .
let' s see ...
can i do anything ?
that could have been a problem .
the sun is shining ...
what the hell are you doing ?
i beg your forgiveness .
i was wrapped in thought .
i' m sorry .
you didn' t hurt yourself ?
no , not at all .
you are too sweet .
didn' t you think i' d manage to find the right train ?
i managed to get awa y for a minute .
how could you go out in such thin shoes ?
i had to rush off so suddenly .
you going back to the practice ?
i have to .
the da y before christmas eve ?
and how' s our little head ?
not so good , actually .
but it will probably be better if i eat dinner .
have you eaten ?
i' il eat later .
i brought your pills .
you and your pills !
i' m really worried about you .
you must eat , my dear , or the practice will eat you up one da y .
i don' t like the staff working late .
you always think of others .
yes ... that is probably my way .
get going and eat a little dinner anywa y .
we' il meet in two da ys in milan .
we could have gone together .
that' s the result of not wanting to fly .
two da ys is nothing .
not for you , perhaps .
don' t try .
you won' t miss me that much .
karin , how little you know me .
serves you right in that case !
i love you .
i love you .
what is it ?
i can' t do it ...
everything !
just grab the handle , open the door and push her out .
like this .
is that so hard ?
who' s slamming the door ?
are you slamming the door ?
this isn' t an amusement park !
hello !
you can slam doors at home !
travel by car !
people ... !
i can' t come with , don' t you understand ?
i can' t be seen .
what if i bump into her ?
i don' t even have a ticket !
can' t you buy a ticket ?
and be noticed by the conductor ?
and my passport ? !
damn !
don' t swear !
hello !
you' re missing the train !
thanks so much !
i' m coming !
don' t bother yourself ...
i' m sorry ...
excuse me , go inside , i' m fine .
i just ...
doors must be kept closed !
it' s me that can' t keep time .
i' m awfully sorry .
it' s no problem .
a crutch , ma ybe .
of course .
i would ask you to calm down !
it was a mishap .
i wanted to do good .
that' s the spirit !
we should be happy .
it' s me that' s the sourpuss .
it' s like my old mother said ...
she was so festive .
" with a son like you , there' s no fun " .
you poor man .
after all you' ve been through .
the war was nothing .
northern finland was beautiful in winter .
look , numbered seats !
sorry !
good day .
good day .
take the cane .
get out the food .
in the crocodile skin case .
and the newspaper ...
in the blue case .
no , no ...
in the blue one .
are you colour blind ?
be careful with my things !
i bought that in london .
take care of this .
travelling with you is what i' d call a real pleasure .
ma y i tempt you ?
no thanks .
all the better for me .
and the scarf .
the scarf !
what an age it takes !
have you seen how he fusses about ?
is this what you would call a holiday ?
i must really apologise for my friend .
sixten kvarnstrm .
gunnar wern .
the critic ?
and author ...
yes .
this is pomp .
theodor bckstrm .
poofter pomp .
and what are you ?
i sought out men because i hated women .
it' s different .
you' re embarrassing our companion .
embarrassing a critic ?
that' d be like asking a cadaver to dance the cancan .
he' s not alwa ys like this .
are you off to the continent to celebrate christmas ?
not exactly to celebrate christmas .
i was thinking of berlin .
we' re also going there .
i don' t mind if it' s destroyed .
at least you can be yourself .
of course .
just look at hitler .
i hear many authors are off to europe ?
that' s correct .
personally , i' m not travelling to write .
no ... but you must surely be looking for something ?
well , this may sound strange and a little nave , but ...
i' d like to make a difference .
yes .
excuse me a second ...
excuse me a second !
make a difference ?
make a difference !
do something good .
imagine helping to construct a europe that is now so destroyed .
i heard berlin has been flattened .
that' s exactly what draws me .
no , no , you must think i sound crazy ...
it' s fascinating to be present and assist in the birth of a new , united europe .
that' s exactly how i feel !
you ?
that would be fitting .
a poofter as midwife ?
like asking an eskimo to run a banana plantation .
no one here is laughing .
no , my upbringing prohibits it !
it' s all about the will .
who knows , ma ybe i' il learn how to be a mason .
i' m looking to believe in something .
i see .
like wittgenstein ?
yes , i find wittgenstein interesting , even if there' s much i don' t understand .
wittgenstein is an idiot .
all people are idiots to you .
yes , that' s true .
i think you will really like berlin .
have you been there often ?
no , never unfortunately .
we bathe in a sea of experience .
why are you so unpleasant ?
i' m unpleasant ?
because i doubt the authority that praises a city never seen ?
or that i question a critic who wants to believe
and embraces a philosopher who believes in nothing ?
did you know that wittgenstein , in a debate with turing was asked
just so the discussion could move on , to admit
that just at that moment there were no hippopotami present ?
but wittgenstein refused .
and so i ask myself , what can such a philosopher ever get one to believe in ?
he doesn' t mean for us to reject knowledge , but to constantly question it .
i see .
as an apprentice mason , you' il have much to stand in , that' s for sure .
nothing is necessarily what it appears to be .
that' s not a bad starting point , i think .
precisely .
you agree with that hag philosophy ?
why do you hate women ?
i' ve never seen good come from one .
but , there' s a mirror in the toilet ...
that was funny !
that was , by god , the funniest thing i' ve heard !
i' il live long on that .
cunt humour !
i' m going to the restaurant car to have a real dinner .
i didn' t mean to be funny .
it' s alwa ys wrong .
i didn' t mean to upset you .
i never get upset .
it would disturb my alcoholism dosage .
if you could only once sit down and listen to others !
it would do you good to have a little break from your bitter monologue .
but you are really the most egocentric person i ever met !
am i , who alwa ys perceived my surroundings as a personal affront
am i egocentric ?
i' m sorry .
there' s nothing to be sorry for .
i don' t understand humour .
don' t worry about him .
he' il soon be happier , as long as he' s had enough .
it' s really nothing to do with me , but ...
how do you stand it ?
well , i' m old now ...
yes , he is too .
it hasn' t always been like this .
but you grow together .
and a shared hell is at any rate better than one alone .
are you married ?
no , it never happened .
never happened ... ?
my god , you' re a young man .
i' m 38 .
38 years old ...
when i was 38
i was thrown out of clubs and restaurants every night .
all week !
yes ...
i would even be so bold as to suggest i was something of
a legend in stockholm society at that time .
oh , yes ...
everyone wanted to sit at pomp' s table .
writers and artists
actors ...
i only thought of having fun .
and you did ?
yes , i did !
yes , i assure you , i had fun !
gracious , what fun i' ve had ...
it' s very nice to talk to you as well , young man .
thank you .
thank you .
you have no idea how it gladdens me to spread good thoughts .
but imagine if it is as you said ?
what do you mean ?
that one can' t know how something is ...
maybe i didn' t even have fun ?
i perhaps only think i had fun ?
no , not at all .
perhaps it is just like a dream ...
a horrid dream ...
my whole life ... has just been absolutely awful !
you' re just fantasizing .
of course you' ve had fun !
but , nothing is what it appears to be .
perhaps i' m not even a real ... homo .
of course , you' re a fantastic homo !
it' s just your imagination .
exactly , it' s imagination , all just imagination !
i' m just like a scarecrow .
a homosexual forgery ... !
stop !
i' m extremely sorry .
who cares about a poofter in tears ?
me !
you have no idea ...
ow , my head !
do you have a headache , as well ?
please ...
allow me to help in some way .
do you want a glass of water ?
something from the restaurant ?
coffee ?
do you like tea ?
all these questions !
be strong ...
excuse me .
i apologise for my broken body .
so that' s how they look .
that' s unusual .
well ... water in a carafe ...
i' il just ...
i' il be right back .
how are you ?
so , it' s you ?
how nice .
we seem to bump into one another .
this is crazy , it' s not happening !
don' t think about it .
i' m on home leave .
i' il be having christmas with dad .
i' il help him la y the roof on the barn .
he gets vertigo in his wheelchair .
but one shouldn' t be downcast .
there' s a little damage here .
oh , god ...
tickets !
i remember ...
i can lie down , too .
i have to go the restaurant car .
i' il pa y someone to help with the roof .
be careful of my train !
i' il pa y for that too .
pay , pay !
he' s so impulsive ...
sorry , but were you going to see your father ?
yes .
it will the first christmas in uppsala for years .
dad' s excited .
uppsala ?
this train goes to berlin .
berlin ?
there' s no end to the surprises on this trip .
don' t be angry anymore .
please .
i can' t stand it when you' re annoyed with me .
i' il try , i promise .
you promised at the station .
i know , i' m sorry !
how can i marry someone i can' t trust ?
i want you to trust me .
confidence , marie .
if a married couple don' t know where the other stands ...
test me , henry , give me another chance .
you don' t have to marry me .
why do you sa y that ?
because all that is important to me , is your happiness .
i' ve asked too much of you when i ask you to help me to mine .
perhaps i' ve been egoistic .
darling , darling henry ...
i beg you , forgive me and let me show you i' m ready to do anything for you .
forgive me .
this isn' t easy for me , either .
i understand .
but you are strong .
our child will also be strong .
tickets . !
just a moment .
it' s enough to press the handle and the door slides opens .
sorry , i' il think of that next time .
some behave as if they own the train .
really ?
but miss is a responsible traveller .
really ?
one sees that immediately .
miss is aware there' s no stop before berlin ?
really ?
troops and refugees have to return .
really ?
yes .
good to have people in the right country , but it upsets the timetable .
yes .
we must all sacrifice , do our duty and struggle as we can .
thank you for the chat , i wish you a pleasant christmas .
i have to work .
really ?
i always work .
you handled that well .
drink this , it' il calm you down .
come , i' il show you what to do .
where is it now ?
there , perhaps ...
there , then ...
how did you do that ?
trade secret ...
cheers .
if you' d drunk that , you would have enjoyed your last cognac .
you have to distract her when you drop it .
it ma y foam a little .
and you must make sure she takes some form of alcohol .
am i good ?
my wife will be very happy .
am i good ?
so , the ice is broken ...
goodness , it' s awful .
that she' s so good ?
no , i mean on the train .
you' ve never done it on a train ?
trains are good .
you kind of get the rhythm for free .
that was fast , i must say .
the youth of toda y are in such a hurry .
are you married ?
yes .
and you ?
mrit .
karin schmalensee .
oh , you' re a jewess ?
do you have anything against that ?
not at all , i was just surprised .
you don' t look like one .
what does a jewess look like ?
i don' t know any jews .
do you ?
yes .
my husband is from a jewish family .
but we don' t see them .
he converted to catholicism .
interesting .
so you' re also catholic ?
i was in love and he wanted it .
i go to mass , but it doesn' t mean as much to me as to henry , my husband .
are you a believer ?
difficult question .
i' m like most people .
when things go well , god and i sa y a polite hello
around christmas .
then , when things are tough , i seek him constantly !
you' re funny .
yes , i am .
it' s unusual .
because i' m a woman or i' m old ?
you' re not old .
how old are you ?
i' m 36 and a half .
don' t sa y " and a half " !
small children and men buying sports cars sa y that .
36 ...
you' re barely confirmed .
it feels a bit like that .
are you happy ?
you ask such questions !
i can return to my eyebrows ...
no , i haven' t spoken like this in ages .
yes , i think i' m happy .
do you have children ?
no , my husband can' t have them .
that' s sad to hear .
you sure it' s him that can' t have any ?
yes , i think so .
i was pregnant once .
when i was young .
you are young , when will you understand that ?
probably not until you' re old .
that' s what usually happens .
are you sure you want him ?
a new husband might give you a child .
i love henry .
don' t you feel well ?
i have a slight migraine .
you' re carrying an entire pharmacy !
could i see ?
chlonedin ...
they just make you tired .
they actually help .
i usually don' t take medicine .
but henry alwa ys prescribes new pills for me .
he treats me as if i was dying .
i have something much better .
homemade cider vinegar with henbane .
i make it myself .
merry christmas !
where do people get it from ?
a glass of water ...
it' s cider vinegar .
i saw that at once .
she looked so pretty .
nothing is necessarily what it appears to be .
for migraines ...
ah , i see ... mushroom soup .
you are a good person , but it' s throwing pearls after swine ...
warm food is on the way .
why ?
one old poofter more or less ...
there can never be too many old poofters , right ?
sorry .
i' m so sorry it turned out this wa y .
let me make up for it , and we' il discuss wittgenstein .
you' il understand .
i didn' t even understand the preface .
what does he mean
that you can' t know if you' ve been on the moon or not ?
i probably destroyed my brain with drink
during that awful time in stockholm !
the moon isn' t so important , it' s how and what we remember .
i remember everything !
like yesterday .
you opened the window and aired the fog like tissue of lies
that had camouflaged my real story .
thanks .
dear you , for the truth .
i remember everything in my life .
such an awful life .
poor pomp !
there' s fish and mashed potatoes .
my whole world ... ... is mashed ...
and petit pois ...
pearls for a ... disgusting homo boar !
pearls ...
it was just a train .
sorry , i had such an awful dream ...
dinner is in ten minutes .
god , i won' t be able to eat a thing .
she will .
she alwa ys eats dinner .
why do you never call her by name ?
she " or " my wife " , never karin .
it' s for you .
i don' t want to hurt you .
but you do hurt me .
we owe a murder victim her name .
not murder , marie .
life shortening , relief from suffering .
i still think she is worth her real name in her last few hours .
allright ...
karin .
at midnight , karin' s suffering will be over .
will you confess afterwards ?
i confess every sunda y .
you will tell the priest .
of course .
will you talk of me as well ?
i have to .
and if the priest gossips ?
marie , a priest can' t gossip about a confession .
he' s made a holy oath before god .
just like when you got married .
what are you getting at ?
as soon as i ask , you get angry !
i don' t understand some things .
i have to ask , for god' s sake !
ask ...
a true catholic , as far as i understand , can' t even get married ?
that' s true .
the pure doctrine
advocates that one live as a celibate to get as close to god as possible .
how has god imagined that the human family would survive ?
that' s a tough question .
some holy oaths are holier than others and even if you break the holiest
you can always confess afterwards and then it' s fine .
yes , that' s how it is .
it sounds very practical .
you shouldn' t make fun of it as you' il miss the actual essence .
namely , that god is perfect .
man is not .
that' s why he has ordained rules that make it easier for us to live .
i think i understand perfectly .
no , you don' t .
because you joke that you , with your paltry human understanding
claim to understand god' s meaning .
i' m just trying to ally my conscience with my actions .
do you trust me ?
i trust you .
do you trust me ?
as i trust myself .
what if she doesn' t take the tablet ?
she ma y not want to share a table .
women are drawn to one another when surrounded by gentlemen .
you know everything about women ?
i know that if you , if it goes wrong ... ... were to feign illness , she would help you back to your compartment .
and i' il be waiting here .
it' s vile , scandalous !
just like you , just now !
i brought christmas ham as well , so you can choose .
he' s wonderful , this wittgenstein .
where does he get it all from ?
you' re happy again !
have you had anything ?
yes ...
you go your wa y , and i' il go my way , and we' il never meet ...
no !
we' il meet ...
maybe you shouldn' t take so many .
i' m worried now ...
why did i give you these ?
we should find a doctor .
come to pomp and we' il pla y doctor !
this is no game !
why not ?
sixten always pla ys doctor , when he' s in the mood ...
what fun it is to be happy !
does anyone know if there' s a doctor on the train ?
do you know if there' s a doctor on board ?
no ...
waiter !
good !
what is that for ?
in case .
just in case .
wait , i' il tell you .
so that damn good for nothing falls in love ...
you left him straight awa y ?
yes .
you see , a man with no imagination , you don' t have fun with him .
henry would never deceive me .
you understand that i wish you well , but never sa y never .
never even about yourself .
it' s curious , you see , but of all the people one knows
i think one knows oneself least of all .
what should you do about that ?
well ...
you should try to spend some time with yourself .
not the person you desperately want to be , but the one that you are .
women are more exciting than men .
that' s just how it is .
it' s nothing to grin over , it' s obvious !
i' m hungry and my headache has gone .
shall we get a bite to eat ?
no thanks , i' m going to read .
what are you reading ?
the butcher in the cloister .
i love these , i alwa ys read them .
unfortunately i' ve become too good at guessing who the murderer is .
i assure you it is the abbess .
they' re starting again .
calm down !
get yourself together , marie .
we never talked of injecting her .
in case .
that' s all i said .
what' s that ?
it' s just a calmative .
do you know of a doctor on the train ?
what has happened ?
do you know of a doctor onboard ?
no idea .
is it serious ?
perhaps .
i have a travelling companion who isn' t well .
he took some medicine that wasn' t his ...
i don' t know .
ask the conductor .
yes , the conductor ...
most people will be in the restaurant car .
why don' t you enquire there ?
don' t you feel well ?
it' s no problem .
just a headache .
perhaps it' s the snowstorm .
yes , i understand .
terrible weather .
maybe you should come with me and have a bite to eat ?
thank you , i think i' il do that .
go ahead , i' il be along shortly .
i' il just check on my travelling companion .
he' s a tad homosexual .
she was in the next compartment ?
it would seem so .
the whole time ?
it would seem so .
will you be able to do this ?
take a tablet if you' re so worried .
darling ...
don' t touch me !
trust me .
wait , i can help ...
goddamn , bugger , shit , hell ... !
sorry !
are you oka y ?
these were real laplandish boots !
can i pa y you something ?
i' m just trying to be nice , carrying soup to the poor refugees ...
hang on ...
can i help in some way ?
i can dry myself !
this is the last time i volunteer and make a spectacle of myself !
are you sure you' il be fine ?
go to hell !
bloody hell , goddamn shit !
how are you ?
some bloody idiot has left glass on the floor !
let me take this ...
thanks .
let' s go to the toilet and have a look .
thanks .
you' re so kind .
i' m actually a doctor .
sometimes one is lucky in life ...
occupled
would you like anything else ?
no , thanks .
have to stop somewhere .
soup and a chair and i don' t know what else .
nice restaurant car ...
i think .
let me know if you need anything .
it' s already too much .
thank you .
pardon , where is the lady' s room ?
continue straight ahead .
thank you .
sorry , is there is a doctor on board ?
have you seen the conductor ?
well , the conductor ...
we don' t really get on ...
i see , so that' s the story .
we have a little cold , do we ?
no , i' m absolutely fine .
it' s my travelling companion .
i get it .
i was barman at berns .
on the gallery .
the toffee balcony .
i see .
right ...
i think the gentleman has a friend over at that table ...
theodor' s unwell .
he' s taken something .
who hasn' t ?
have you no heart ?
sure , it' s just a little marinated .
you must help him !
i recognize that voice .
i' m not finished here .
is it sergeant axelsson ?
why are you so unpleasant ?
what joy is there in hurting others ?
axelsson is a tenor .
this is more of a soft baritone .
is it me , of the two of us
who has a passion for hurting others ?
i might hurt myself , that' s true .
but you can' t deny that i support the restaurant business .
there was a bite to this soup .
i must have the recipe .
waiter ?
you will drink yourself to death .
life is no more fun by extending it .
waiter ...
this tomato soup is fantastic .
how did you do it ?
my god , look at you !
is it you ?
i can' t see .
is it you ?
i' m so terribly sorry !
i must make it up to you somehow .
no , no ... absolutely not !
everything is fine .
don' t find me picky , but our meetings so far have been of a violent nature .
i feel so good just now ...
i just want to sit here and enjoy .
all alone !
i have to go .
i' il come back .
we must talk .
better with higher infant mortality .
that it should be so hard to be pleasant !
have you found a doctor ?
no .
have you seen the lady you came with ?
no , sorry ...
fantastic !
what a bite to this soup !
spanish peppers ...
and no hot dogs to hand .
it' s doesn' t burn , but not far from it .
wonderful !
what happened ?
sorry .
did i spill something ?
i' m probably in the way .
vacant
excuse me , my mistake .
no bother .
evening .
are you alone ?
i' m expecting someone .
a table for two ...
would you like anything to drink ?
a cognac , please .
has anything happened .
no , not at all .
ma y i join you ?
of course .
i' ve ordered a cognac .
i' il join you .
two cognacs , please .
a case of cognac for me too .
ah , so you are staring ?
you women are used to free entertainment .
i think that' s enough cognac .
a pail of absinthe with a straw , then .
we won' t mind him .
no ...
you never have done !
the snow is beautiful .
like a whore' s arse at christmas .
what are you sa ying ?
i had to .
can' t stand to be close .
there are women present .
women are constantly absent .
have you no respect for women ?
being a woman is a wa y of avoiding public responsibility .
two cognacs .
thank you .
i suggest the gentleman retire .
you don' t know what you ask of me , my boy .
could i pa y ?
the gentleman has already paid .
that' s something .
just a minute .
have to watch the household budget .
yes , let' s go ...
good girl .
listen here ...
i never believed in you !
may i sit down ?
could i trouble you for a drop of port ?
it must be terribly warm sitting in that costume and mask ?
but what don' t we do for children ?
my first husband , kjell hugo
he sweated so awfully , we couldn' t even touch one another !
in bed i had to sleep in rain clothes .
poor man ...
cheers .
cheers .
sorry , what behaviour .
forgive me .
are you not well ?
i' m ...
i' il just go ...
i' il just go to the lady' s room .
excuse me , could i have the bill ?
i am just going to look after my companion .
good , get her to our carriage .
what are you mumbling about ?
i' il have another , it' s christmas !
my second husband , bertil ...
good god , what has happened here ?
these people have lived in a camp for several years .
they' ve eaten nothing but bread and porridge .
then some idiot in stockholm gave them chocolate and oranges .
i' m at the end of my tether .
it' s been two da ys since we slept .
we struggle and do our best , and he buys chocolate and oranges .
he probably meant well .
of course .
have you seen a doctor ?
are you also ill ?
no , it' s not me .
it' s a friend .
he just keeps laughing .
i see .
if you should find a doctor , could you be so kind as to send him over ?
after you friend has stopped laughing .
this takes precedence , of course .
he' s not laughing that much .
if one could only do something .
let me take care of that ...
i' m sorry ...
i' m sorry ...
my fifth husband , karl erik ...
he was the most problematic .
he was so scared of floors .
imagine that ?
so i had to carry him all the time and he was so fat .
what the hell ?
yes , you could sa y that !
i see you' re on the edge of your seat .
thank you very much .
in the beginning we lived in stocksund , but there was so much floor there ...
and your companion ?
i don' t know where she went .
so we bought a boathouse in falsterbo and i was seven months pregnant .
then he developed a water phobia .
the door of our compartment opens on its own .
could you ... ?
we' il look at it at once .
we don' t want further accidents on this trip .
it was sad , as he was a priest and the nuns didn' t understand him .
go and pee .
i think i' il have another drink .
bartender ?
have you got any port ?
i know beatrice , but you must forgive him .
i' ve tried to maintain my faith throughout this entire war !
i have struggled , struggled to give a slither of light to people
who have gone through the most unimaginable darkness .
i' ve bandaged war invalids with barely a body to bandage !
my tears flowed , i almost choked with sorrow and disgust over man' s outrage .
but i did it .
i did it !
i believed !
i tried to forgive the inexplicable !
you must rest ...
how can i rest when he' s at large ?
who knows what he' il get up to next ?
you heard what the conductor said ?
he' s a writer you sa y ?
that' s what he calls himself .
how can you give starving people ... ... chocolate and oranges ? !
what a cock up !
what an out and out bloody idiot !
there is no god !
believe me .
no god could have created such an idiotic bumbler .
he was trying to do good , you said ?
that' s what he said .
i have lost my faith !
after all these years !
goddamn bloody shit and piss !
beatrice ...
don' t sit and sa y beatrice the whole time like some bloody parrot !
don' t you think i know my name ?
just because god seems to have forgotten !
i understand how you feel .
what is it you understand so well ?
how do you think it feels to have a million tons of chicken on your head ?
if you get hold of him , you' il kill him won' t you ?
don' t let the damned nuisance live .
promise me .
the railway doesn' t have that authority .
there seem to be signs of life here !
it smells like my old barracks .
that' s also his work .
of course it is .
how do you feel ?
i feel so good , i have tablets ... ... that put music over everything .
oops , sorry , miss .
hello !
you can' t go there , it' s for the army !
let him wander about .
what could possibly be worse ?
the whole train' s going straight to hell , anyway .
i also think it' s important that we think positively .
you ladies can feel safe , it works .
thanks so much .
no bother .
thank you .
how could you let that sweetie go so quickly .
have you no judgement ?
i must go to see what happened to her .
if i were you , but a man , i' d never chase after
a little goose that can' t even drink a cognac without spilling it .
i' il be back soon .
my first man said that too .
on his return i didn' t recognise him .
i don' t feel at all sorry for you .
people are crazy .
lucky i' m an old maid .
father christmas !
please , could she say hello ?
what a hurry he was in .
he has to take care of lots of girls .
marie , are you there ?
henry ?
what' s happening ?
nothing , the lock has jammed .
did you speak to her ?
let me out !
did you speak to her ? !
let me out !
is it you ?
yes ...
there was a strange sound .
it was the wind on opening the door .
did you find a doctor ?
no .
i' ve searched the whole train .
the wagon in front of this is the last before the locomotive and it' s empty .
oh , conductor ?
i' m looking for my companion ...
excuse me !
now you have gone too far !
maiming war heroes and poisoning refugees is one thing .
we have off da ys .
but playing with the emergency brake !
don' t you see the penalty ? !
i don' t care that it' s christmas , this is being reported !
unless you have a very good explanation .
i saw father christmas .
father christmas ?
where ?
please , miss ...
here , outside the door !
right !
if you all have your wish lists ready , let' s go and speak to him .
who knows , maybe the reindeer were tired and wanted to go by train !
i saw him clearly !
my grandmother claims gnomes pinch her sherry in the pantry at night .
was he alone ?
or did he have the wife with him ?
ma ybe some elves needed to pee ?
he stood there !
we' ve lost at least six minutes .
like i said , this will be reported !
i tell you i saw a person through the window .
someone in danger !
what should i have done !
come , lady , we' re losing time .
right , report and driver' s licence .
the police will contact you .
i tried to save a person' s life .
it' s no fun ...
but those are the rules which i' d rather follow than having fun .
had this been texas , you would have been shot by now .
it would be appropriate to be grateful .
henry !
oh , henry , what should i do ?
was it you ... ?
i don' t know ...
i don' t know how to thank you ...
god , you need a doctor .
i am a doctor .
even we have to get dressed up once a year .
i' ve searched the train for a doctor .
what for ?
a man in my compartment swallowed lots of tablets .
he' s behaving oddly .
what kind ?
i think they' re chlonedin .
that' s okay .
just make sure he doesn' t drink alcohol .
it' s lethal .
really ?
go on , i' il be allright .
i' il come and see him in a while .
i' m in the last carriage .
we' re in the carriage behind the restaurant car .
thanks so much !
sorry , darling , sorry !
good god !
quiet !
why couldn' t you open it ?
i don' t know .
i' m not so strong .
maybe i did something wrong .
when i tried it , nothing happened .
i did what you said , but i was so nervous when i was going to drink ...
there , there ...
i' m useless , i can' t do anything !
there , there , it' s okay now .
you just got a little unlucky .
now we have all the time in the world .
we know where she' s sitting now .
look at the state of you ...
everything is my fault and you sa y nothing .
you are the most kind man in the world .
i know how we should kill her .
hello ?
is anyone there ?
i' ve gone around the whole train , but it seems everyone wants to go at once .
and what a long time some people take .
one even took in a soup pot !
what do you give me for that ?
it was so funny , i was sitting sewing and i got an ice skate in my eye !
but i feel so good !
i' il sit in my cabin in the meantime .
jesus is in you , darling !
thank you ...
i don' t understand .
i small glass of port , please .
your nice friend has left .
it' s fine .
i found a doctor .
what will a doctor be able to do without an operating theatre ?
no , no .
the doctor said he shouldn' t drink alcohol .
what has alcohol got to do with it ?
don' t you know , the poor soldier
you set on fire had his whole face burnt ?
set on fire ?
you lit his cigarette .
his bandage ...
oh , my god ... !
it' s not true !
i must report myself to the police .
it' s a popular notion on this train .
apropos , your friend took a bottle of jameson when he left .
sixten ?
call him whatever , as long as he pa ys .
what if he gives it to pomp ?
what have i done ? !
alcohol and chlonedin !
pomp ?
a swedish soldier burns ...
and he thinks of his dog .
you clumsy fool !
why do you try and help all the time ?
good god ... !
i hope , hope , hope ...
doctor !
doctor !
jesus christ ...
you alone control life and death .
give me the strength in my difficult task .
help me to kill the one that prevents me living the life
that you have chosen for me .
amen .
it' s fine now .
that' s good .
it' s not at all fine .
she' s drunk .
just cut off his head ...
let it roll ...
i' m so sorry .
i meant well ...
so you' re back again ?
of course , some of us are still alive .
beatrice , keep quiet .
i' m going to kill myself .
you do that !
let me know if you need help !
clumsy bugger !
henry never drinks alcohol .
and you love him ?
i think i love his moral sense .
his strong faith .
you know where you have henry ...
the waiter fixed that .
well , gunnar ...
there' s nothing left .
do it .
do it ... !
that will have to be my nightcap .
i have to think of my beauty sleep .
sleep well .
good god !
why must i be so bloody clumsy ? !
you can at least help me to die ? !
sorry for all the ill i' ve caused !
no !
it' s jammed .
it' s the crutch that' s being wilful ...
hello ?
are you locked in ?
it' s not you , is it ?
say it isn' t you !
i' il help you out .
no , no , that won' t be necessary !
i' il be fine .
don' t hold the handle !
i' m holding the handle !
did i break anything ?
wait , your crutch .
there' s a draught here ...
thank you .
you' re too kind .
see you later ...
are you oka y ?
are you going to smoke ?
you can bet on it .
prudish little cunts are the worst .
you are fantastic .
help !
i' m stuck !
careful ...
now !
karin ...
it' s not what you think .
you think too much !
no !
no ... !
look !
he managed one more anywa y .
have you read wittgenstein ?
don' t you feel well ?
it' s no problem .
just a headache .
wait , he has a syringe .
cheers .
cheers .
i' il just go to the lady' s room .
i am just going to look after my companion .
imagine , it was the gardener !
how irritating .
life goes on .
think about what i said .
there are alwa ys new men .
thanks , but i think i have made up my mind .
merry christmas .
of course , it' s christmas eve .
there goes a wonderful woman .
like me ?
almost .
welcome , major .
i hope your journey was entertaining .
what do you think could happen on a train between stockholm and berlin ?
away is nice , but home is best ?
he stopped the train .
did you hear ?
he stopped it !
sorry , i didn' t mean to .
i wanted to build something good .
what has he done ?
no idea ...
what we did , we did well .
we did it bloody well .
i love you .
i love you .
morning , gunnar !
it looks good .
and so stable .
that wall will be there for a long time .
it' il be nice for the kids , they can kick a ball against it .
it offers protection against the elements as well .
you can sit and catch a tan and lounge about .
it' il be great .
it' s fantastic .
only three of you toda y ?
someone off sick , are they ?
it' s easy to catch a cold out here in this biting wind .
i talked to heinz here .
a nice bloke .
precise and to the point .
he knows what he wants .
you' ve let your hair out a bit more today ?
of course , you want to feel a little unbound and free sometimes ...
