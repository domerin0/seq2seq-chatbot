well , how would it work ?
you open an account with my money and then write the check for me .
why would i want to do that ?
i' d let you write some for yourself .

where would you like to go ?
there' s ice skating at the glenbrook mall .

no , but our neighbors do .
take him girls .
it' s freezing outside .
wear your coats .
you live with your parents ?
just temporarily .
i' m leaving soon as my brother recovers .

what' s wrong with you ?
chronic despair .
hey , what are you kids doing ?
jumping .
well , who told you , you could jump on our trampoline ?
jim .
he' s my uncle .
well , tell your uncle jim that he needs to ask me before ...
he' s not my uncle .
i hardly know him .
he' s on a date with my mother right now .
he took mom up to his room ...
okay , okay .
that' s fine .
just ask next time .
where' s benjamin' s dad ?
he' s around .
he sees ben every once a month or so , if he remembers .
and he doesn' t have a problem with you dating ?
oh , no .
he' s incredibly jealous .
who are all these people ?
they' re all writers .
oh yeah ?
that' s virginia woolf .
underneath her is richard yates , he' s one of my favorites .
what' d he write ?
sad stories about sad people with pathetic dreams .
when he died almost all of his books were out of a print .
that' s weird .
then of course there' s poe and plath and buroughs .
thats a writer named breece d pancake .
next to him is beckett .
then dorothy parker .
the big one is hemingway .
oh yeah , i read him in high school .
he' s good .
what did you like about him ?
i think he had a boner for what he did , you know ?
yeah .
his stories weren' t as stuffy and made up as others .
they were realer .
he was a realist .
maybe that' s why .
he shot himself in the head .
geez .
so did pancake .
that one threw himself off a bridge .
she put her head in an oven .
and that one , that one and that one all drank themselves to death .
is benjamin' s dad going to try and hurt me ?
you ?
no .
i thought you said he was insanely jealous ?
he wouldn' t be jealous of you .
why not ?
he just wouldn' t .
besides , we' re not dating .
we' re not ?
hey could you guys ... could you uh ...
do you have any board games ?
oh god .

i don' t know .
but what do you think ?

now listen , i' m going down there to explain to these peckerheads that they got the wrong person .
what i need you to do is cover for your mom and me while i' m gone .
sure , sure .
no problem , donny .
if anyone asks what' s going on , just play dumb .
so , who do you think did this ?
you .
me ?
i can' t believe you' d think that your own ...
cut the bullshit , evil .
i know it was you .
all right , you got me .
how could you be such an idiot ?
i wrapped everyone of those packages in foil , and then i double plastic bagged them , and then i' d put a little big league chew in there too , grape ...
they are taking my mom to prlson , evil .
i understand that .
but you' re not going to rat out your uncle stace now , are you ?
you think i' d let my mother stay locked up for you ?
i' d be a little nervous to narc out a guy with no money after you' d just opened a four thousand dollar account .
you fucker .
just be careful when you point a finger at someone else you are pointing three at yourself and a thumb to the sky .
what' s that mean ?
that means , is your piss clean ?
what are you doing here ?
mom brought me .
what is your mom doing here ?
i didn' t know that .
there' s a lot people don' t know about our central intelligence agency .

what are you going to do ?
common there' s not a jury in the world that' s going to believe that that woman is selling drugs .
they will believe a guy like me does .
you do , evil .
see .
there' s only one thing to do here , evil .
and you know what it is .
what ?
confess and go to jail and man rape for the next five years ?
you make your own choices .
look there' s three thousand dollars left in that account .
that' il get you pretty far from here
no , i' m not going to sell my family out .
look , i' m family too .
i can' t believe you .
hold on shithead .
that money is in your name and if you don' t give it back to me then it' s like you already accepted it .
make your own choices .
jim hey .

what' s full ?
jesus christ , man .

i couldn' t ask her to do that .
that' s disgusting .

i don' t know what to tell you .
what kind of coach are you ?

you must not think much of me , either , i guess .
oh , i do .
i think you' re all great .
what ?
you think i' m great ?
well , sure .
i think you' re great .
there are so many fun and cheery people in the world .
don' t you think you' d be better off with one of them ?
someone more like yourself ?
you think i' m fun and cheery ?
of course you are .
you just can' t stop complimenting me , can you ?
you' re missing my point .
no , i' m not .
i' m getting it very clearly .
you want to come in ?
it' s okay .
i don' t mind .
no .
i think i' iljust say good bye here .
okay .
bye , ben .
bye .
bye , anika .
good night , jim .
you can kiss if you want .
i don' t care .
you' re kind of apathetic for such a little guy , aren' t you , ben ?
yeah .
good night , you two .
mom , you' re home .
yup .
how ?
something called bail .
one of the girls in prison told me about it .
apparently your father never realized it was an option .
i called a very nice bondsman in kendalville who put up the money for me .
that' s great .
oh , honey don' t touch that .
it' s for kiki .
who' s kiki ?
she' s the con that gave me the number for the bondsman .
i' m going to bring cobbler to her and all of girls
i made friends with at county .
all those ladies were so nice to me .
it' s hard to believe they' re criminals .
have you talked to tim ?
oh .
yeah .
same old tim .
i need a fork .
my fork !
jimmy .
jim .
yoo hoo .
jimmy .
wake up .
you have visitors .
who ?
get your ass up , jim .
it' s four o ' clock .
sorry to say ass in front of you , mrs. roush .
oh , no .
it worked .
hi , jimmy .
hi , mom .
you have a nice nap ?
yeah .
your little friend , ben , is helping me make dinner downstairs .
oh .
ben' s here ?
we' re making goulash .
jim' s my pretty boy .
i brought you something .
what ?
don' t get too excited , it' s not much .
what is it ?
a smile , for poor old hemingway .
i don' t know .
it doesn' t look right to me .
that' s because you' re used to seeing it the other way .
the other way is true to life .
the other way is depressing .
like i said ...
oh , jim .
you smell nice .
thanks .
i like you a lot , anika .
i like you a lot , too .
so does ben .
he does ?
oh my god , he totally looks up to you .
oh no .
it' s true .
ben shouldn' t look up to me .
sure he should .
no he shouldn' t .
why ?
i think i might of caused my brother to hurt himself .
that' s crazy .
i told him life was pointless and i couldn' t believe he hadn' t killed himself .
so , anika , i understand you' re a nurse .
yes , i am mrs. roush .
that' s great .
i love the work .
so , where' d you two meet ?
at a bar .
tim just can' t stop saying enough nice things about you .
oh , how is tim ?
i haven' t talked to him today .
oh he' s good .
benjamin ?
yes .
do you go to school yet ?
he' s in third grade .
third grade ?
but you' re so little .
you' re little .
benjamin .
anika ?
as you know tim broke both of his legs so he can' t easily get in and out of bed we got him one of those crooked plastic bottles for you know his business , but its not quite big enough for his ...
mom ...
to tell you the truth i don' t really like my family that much .
what a terrible thing to say .
its true i mean i love them all to death , but i just can' t stand to be so close .
well what good is that kind of love ?
i' m thinking of leaving .
you know , i was thinking , maybe you and ben could come with me .
where ?
i don' t know .
great .
sounds like a good plan .
where would you like to go ?
i can' t afford to go anywhere .
sure you can .
there are nursing jobs all over the country .
just pick a place .
well , you know , i' ve always wanted to go to new orleans .
new orleans .
why new orleans ?
bourbon st.
what' s your second choice ?
vegas .
i' ve heard really good things about new orleans .
let' s try it there first .
i can' t just up and move to new orleans .
you can if you do .
what about ben' s dad ?
he' s a deadbeat .
i should be ben' s dad .
you' re crazy .
am i ?
what' s this ?
it' s an inspector nestor book .
remember when you used to read these to me ?
you' d always know how each story was going to end half way through every book .
they were predictable .
maybe .
i could never guess them .
you' re an idiot .
anyway , i found them in the garage .
thought maybe you could read em to the girls .
they miss you , you know ?
the whole team misses you .
sure .
they do .
i bet they haven' t even noticed .
they' re playing their last game this weekend .
anything you want me to tell the team at last practice ?
tell them to make a fucking basket .
i can' t do it .
maybe you can .
maybe you can' t .
but you' il never know unless you try .
i' ve been trying all practice .
true .
hey , you two .
hey .
what gives ?
i thought practice was supposed to be over 30 minutes ago
jim won' t let me go until i make five more baskets .
i' m sorry benjamin .
i didn' t mean to make you feel like you couldn' t go home if you didn' t make the shots .
but that' s what you said .
why didn' t you call if you knew you were going to be late ?
i' m sorry , i didn' t know it was that big a deal .
yeah , well it is a big deal .
stuff like that is a very big deal to moms .
what' s your problem , anika ?
nothing , jim .
just , you can' t ask a girl to move 1082 miles away with you unless you' re really going to follow through .
why wouldn' t i follow through ?
because you don' t know what it would be like .
what would it be like ?
difficult .
very difficult .
great .
i' m used to challenges .
you' re use to avoiding them .
well , maybe i don' t want you to .
oh .
okay .
i just said maybe .
no , the whole idea was stupid anyway .
come on ben .
come on anika .
i' d like to make a withdraw please .
i need to be on my own .
i understand .
sometimes mom wishes she could be on her own too .
what ?
nothing .
just kidding .
where you going to ?
maybe new orleans .
oh fun .
you know mom' s never really been anywhere .
i know mom .
maybe i' il come visit you after my trial .
or before , either would be great .
i can' t really leave the state until after
jimmy .
all right team , i know it' s been a rough season
girls ... but ...
sorry , i' m late .
no problem , benjamin .
is your mom here ?
no .
like i said , i know it' s been a rough season for us this year .
not a lot of shots have fallen for us .
in fact not a single shot has fallen for us in 14 games .
so i guess the question we need to ask ourselves is , are we going to let those 14 games determine the next one ?
because if we are , then we may as welljust go out there and shake hands with the other team .
congratulate them on their victory .
i see some of you nodding your heads in agreement right now .
by all means , it' s not an altogether absurd idea .
odds are , we are going to lose no matter how we go about playing this game .
so why do we play at all ?
well team ...
i don' t really have an answer for that .
and do you know why ?
because its a stupid question asked by a doubtful and unhappy man .
forget his question .
you just got to keep playing .
because if you don' t you might end up like him and let me tell you , he is no fun .
nobody knows what we' re capable of .
the past does not always predict the future .
now that team may have seen us play before but they' ve never seen us play today .
am i right ? / yeah .
am i right ?
yeah .
well , all right then .
well let' s show them what we can do .
one , two , three .
go ladders .
hey , come on .
come over here .
no long faces .
that was good .
that was our best game yet .
shut up , jim .
good job , jimmy .
you make a great coach .
dear mom i don' t know where to start , so i' iljust begin with the end and work my way back .
i came home because i ran out of money and had nowhere else to go .
if i' d had any other option , i would have taken it .
i did not consider the simple fact of having a place to return a blessing
instead , i thought of it as a burden and a symbol of failure .
i' m ashamed to admit that growing up i pitied you and what i thought was your naive belief that our dreams could come true , simply by virtue of having them .
because the truth , as i witnessed it , was something completely different .
the truth actually was that nothing worked out and no one , anywhere lived the life they wanted .
but i see now , that it was me with the naive belief .
i thought if i resigned myself to disappointment , at least i' d be better off then those people who tried and failed .
and i hate myself for only realizing this now and for taking and taking from you without giving anything back .
you are one of the few good peaches in are one of the few good peaches in
i promise not to waste anymore time or take your love for granted again .
i love you so much .
jim .
p. s. the money in this envelope is from stacy .
i figure he owes you at least this much for all the snacks he' s stolen .
and he' s the one who' s been sending drugs through the fed ex account .
promise to call you soon .
jim
thirsty ?
what are you doing here ?
benjamin wanted to apologize to you for telling you to shut up .
i' m sorry jim .
that' s alright , benjamin .
how' d you find me ?
we stopped by the house to see you .
your dad told us .
where you going ?
new orleans . / great .
benjamin , do you want to say goodbye to jim ?
bye , jim .
bye ...
benji .
you be good to your mother .
and promise me not to get too much more apathetic .
at least not until your teens .
okay .
it never would have worked out anyway .
is that your bus ?
yeah .
you better run .
bye .
bye , jim .
stop that , benji .
common lets go .
mom .
stop the car .
can i get a ride ?
sure .
i thought you never ran .
