should we say it one last time ?
one cannot live fully without embracing suicide and crime .
say it .
a pact made with relentless fire that requires that some live . . . . . . others die .
on three .
one . . .
. . . two . . .
. . . three !
each of us has within us a weak aspect . . . . . . eager to give up freedom to be dominated .
but we also have a will that desires freedom , that insists . . . . . . on deciding for ourselves , each of us individually . . . . . . what is good . . . . . . and what is evil .
are there any questions ?
doesn' t anyone want to challenge justin' s thesis ?
do you all submit to this darwinian struggle of egos ?
i got a question .
mr. haywood , you' re awake !
let' s hear it .
what' s a dork like you know about power ?
what would an ass like you know about philosophy ?
keep it civil .
are you talking about crime ?
you should wake up more often .
what about it ?
all freedom risks crime .
freedom is crime .
it thinks of itself and not of the group .
thank you , justin .
very daring .
thank you .
for those of you interested in the source of his report . . . . . . take a look at nietzsche .
you really need to get laid , bonaparte .
hey , justin .
remember me ?
what do you want ?
i want to blow your brains out .
and i' il make it look like a suicide .
everyone would believe that you killed yourself .
you won' t get away with it .
your shoe prints are unique .
they' d be traced back to you .
the fibers on your shirt are all over me .
your hair too .
it' s called transference .
more importantly , your fingerprints . . .
. . . on my neck . . . . . . where you touched me .
you can' t get them off skin .
you can with a magna brush . . . . . . or a fingerprint cam or an iodine gun and silver transfer sheets .
you don' t have the discipline to commit a murder .
is that right ?
let' s see .
bang !
you' re dead .
what took you so long ?
i' ve been waiting .
no , i have something better .
what is it ?
absinthe .
wormwood infused alcohol .
the molecular structure is almost identical to tetrahedral chlorine .
tetra what ?
the active ingredient in marijuana .
where did you get it ?
poets drank it for inspiration .
it' s been illegal since the turn of the century .
even better .
to the systematic derangement of our senses .
forget the senses .
let' s derange the world .
we will .
when ?
soon .
what about tonight ?
what about right now ?
i have a biology ...
fuck your biology !
you always have excuses .
let' s forget it .
we' ve been planning this for months .
i' m sick of planning .
that' s all it is with you .
it' s talk and plans and dreams .
you' re a jerk off .
so jerk off .
richard , wait .
just be patient .
here comes the hyena .
why can' t i go inside the perimeter ?
i told them not to let anybody in .
it' s your first homicide .
i didn' t want you stepping on your tongue .
take this .
what is it ?
important tool .
hey , boys !
snack time !
set up a staging area .
this place will be crawling with people . . . . . . including our chief .
rod ?
yeah , rod is not a cop .
darnell , get out of my crime scene !
come on !
sorry , cassie .
there' s only one way into a crime scene .
put your foot where mine goes and nowhere else .
ready ?
ever do this in vice ?
no .
right there .
looks like some kind of boot .
what' s that smell like ?
smells like vomit .
that' s what i thought .
bag some for the lab .
what' s the matter ?
nothing .
notice the hemorrhaging ?
she was strangled .
finger shaped marks around the neck .
look at this .
clean cut .
trophy ?
that' d be my guess .
defensive wounds .
she put up a fight .
good for you .
this is a secondary crime scene .
why ?
this wound would produce lots of blood .
there' s very little here .
what about these ?
piquerism .
pre or postmortem ?
post , no blood .
not bad , vice .
probably aced your detective' s exam .
the wind is picking up , we' il lose evidence .
hold on to everything we find .
any idea who she is ?
no .
no car , no i. d.
jane doe .
hey , bonaparte .
what' s the matter ?
miss mills ?
time' s up .
put your pens down .
exchange your test with a neighbor .
number 20 is c. . . . . .
burnt norton .
i suppose you find it funny .
what ?
me flunking a pop quiz .
you didn' t flunk .
you got 1 9 out of 20 .
please pass the tests forward .
wait up , i want to talk to you .
why did you do that ?
i have motives .
like what ?
i need your help for my physics midterm .
why me ?
because you' re a genius , okay ?
i live at 1 1 08 chandler .
can you remember that ?
around 5 ?
hi , lisa .
this friend ...
turn right .
it' s right here .
a houseboat .
neat .
neat indeed .
i like it out here .
not too many people .
thanks .
see you tomorrow .
you gonna see me to the door ?
of course .
you made detective in four years ?
must be smarter than you look .
thank you .
it' il only get worse , i warn you .
you been talking to the boys ?
i heard a few things .
they tell you why i was called the hyena ?
why ?
female hyenas have a mock penis .
draw your own conclusions .
does that bother you ?
i just wear loose slacks .
it' s really not a problem .
see you later .
no prints .
the killer must have worn gloves .
so it' s not a husband or boyfriend .
why ?
you don' t use gloves to kill your wife .
unless you' ve thought about it .
missing ring finger .
ritual ?
serial killer ?
maybe a comment on matrimony .
a negative one .
maybe we should investigate every bad marriage in the county .
why don' t you get on that ?
let' s start with you .
ever been married ?
nope .
what' s this ?
an old murder case i was involved in .
the guy' s up for parole , they want me to testify .
what do we have on jane doe ?
i' m checking missing persons nationwide .
run her prints , have an artist do a sketch .
i got it .
bonaparte !
i didn' t think you' d show .
come in .
who did these ?
they' re quite good .
thank you .
you did them ?
don' t look so surprised .
i modeled for them too .
bonaparte , you' re blushing .
why do you call me that ?
ever take a career aptitude test ?
no .
if you ever did , they' d recommend you a career as a dictator .
why ?
who would listen to me ?
where' s your physics book ?
you' re overfeeding that thing .
it' il get as fat as you are .
i hope this is better than that other stuff .
it' s kgb .
for $400 , it better put me on the moon .
you' il be totally satisfied , i guarantee it .
money back ?
come on , can' t we cut a deal ?
you don' t want it ?
i want it .
richie rich .
i hate it when you call me that .
it' s a deal .
bring me a couple pigtailed cheerleaders . . . . . . then i give it to you free .
how can i trust that ?
i love this part .
can i just get the product already ?
check this out .
come on ...
you' il get it .
hang on .
listen to her .
she loves it .
we got our jane doe .
her name was olivia lake .
she missed three days of work .
her supervisor found the place like this .
what do we know about the supervisor ?
married , two kids , solid alibi .
maybe she caught somebody in the middle of a 459 , and he panicked ?
and what , took the body with him ?
where did these mud prints come from ?
there' s a planting bed out here .
looks dry as a bone .
maybe she watered the lawn .
we got a time of death ?
based on stomach content , between 9 and 1 0 thursday night .
how about 9 : 27 ?
can we come in ?
let the games begin .
sam kennedy , al swanson .
new assistant d. a. and former member of our department .
nice to meet you .
miss mayweather , always a pleasure .
heard you finally passed the bar .
did they make it true or false ?
she hasn' t lost her sting .
what are you doing here ?
staying informed .
really ?
sam , please keep him informed .
thank you .
what do we got here ?
sorry .
can i have you sign off ?
okay .
sam , it' s me .
i' il be a little late .
why don' t you get started ?
looks like a body dump .
jesus , she' s alive !
nice detective work .
how' d you find me ?
talk to the neighbors .
you said a little late , and it' s been three hours .
this about that d. a. , swanson ?
that asshole ?
no .
he seemed okay .
yeah , well , try dating him .
he got rough with me , so i broke his nose with a cat .
a cat ?
well , a ceramic cat .
no , thanks .
good .
then you can walk me home .
sure .
thank you .
sit down .
i should get going .
what' s the rush ?
can i ask you a personal question ?
i can hardly wait .
how did you get into this work ?
why homicide ?
someone i knew was murdered , and i got interested .
really ?
no .
i' m just bullshitting you .
it' s just the kind of crap people like to hear .
wait .
what are you doing ?
it' s called sex .
it' s fun , you should try it .
we gotta work together .
this is a bad idea .
don' t worry , i won' t get possessive .
wait .
why are you doing this ?
because i want to .
what about what i want ?
what do you want ?
right now ?
yeah .
this .
wait .
slow down .
no , no , leave that on .
just that .
please .
sure .
what' s the matter ?
you gotta get up , you gotta go .
why ?
because i gotta get some sleep .
can we sleep together ?
bed' s too small .
no , it' s not .
come on , you gotta go .
jesus !
i' il see you tomorrow .
good night .
the evidence is so tiny , you wouldn' t recognize it .
a few red and yellow carpet fibers , some hair .
that' s it .
the fibers will be tested to find generic and subgeneric classes . . . ... then compared to a database for the manufacturer .
fibers consistent with a mass produced variety , made in denver .
distributed in the united states under several names .
no help .
same with the red fibers .
several trilobal nylon fibers . . . . . . along with other fibers will be matched with a brand .
it' s sold by hanover sampson for several discount stores .
that narrows it down .
they sold 50, 000 in that color last year .
examination of the cuticle , cortex and medulla of the hair . . . ... will reveal them to be human .
two brown human hairs .
definitely not the victim' s .
all but one .
at first , it will baffle them .
one hair of nonhuman origin , scale matches cynocephalus maimon .
it' s a freaking baboon hair .
no fingerprints , no murder weapon .
they have their work cut out for them .
that' s what they' re paid for .
coroner said strangulation was slow .
perhaps the victim was being tortured .
the postmortem stab wounds barely broke the surface .
okay , that' s it .
they' il decide that , given the sloppy nature of the crime scene . . . . . . the postmortem mutilation . . . . . . the profile will be that of a disorganized offender .
poor social skills .
nocturnal by nature .
probably into pornography .
intelligent , but uneducated .
lives alone , few relations with women .
attack was spontaneous .
unplanned .
he didn' t drive down close to the dump spot .
that is planning .
but he left the footprints .
no evidence will lead to the suspect , but they' il damn him .
when will they have a suspect ?
they' re eating out of our hands .
poor ray .
he' il never see it coming .
cassie , look at this .
vigi boots .
what the hell are vigi boots ?
there he is , in the black coat .
don' t let him charm you too much .
richard haywood ?
cassie mayweather , sam kennedy , police .
can we talk to you ?
yeah , sure .
you' re willing to speak without an attorney ?
sure .
where were you last thursday night ?
what is this about ?
answer the question .
i was cramming for this calculus midterm .
i was with a study group .
how long ?
from about 7 until 3 friday morning .
that' s quite a cram session .
yeah , well . . . .
i got kind of a spotty record , and i gotta keep my grades up for college .
can you give us the names of the other people there ?
sure .
am i in some kind of trouble ?
you seem very particular about your appearance .
thanks .
i like your outfit too .
she looks good .
it' s , like , feminine . . . . . . but it still manages to be professional .
is that like a pleather ?
kmart .
we' re interested in your shoes .
let' s talk about these .
vigis ?
you own a pair of these ?
you bought them at scarlatti' s , downtown santa barbara , for $637 . 50 . . . . . . on your platinum bankcard .
size 1 2d .
this can' t be about my shoes .
why not ?
this is about my shoes ?
you got me freaked out like i did something .
did you find them or what ?
i reported them stolen three weeks ago .
i even filed a report with the front office .
did you find the shoes or not ?
i think you should tell me what' s going on .
because i' m spinning out here .
shoe prints matching these were found at a murder scene last week .
the covington woman ?
that' s right .
you think the person who stole my shoes committed this murder ?
i' il cooperate in any way i can .
any idea who stole your boots ?
no , i don' t .
i wish i did now , though .
any enemies at school ?
well , it' s high school .
what does that mean ?
not to sound arrogant , but there are people who envy me .
really ?
yeah .
why would they do that ?
well , let' s just say that i' m very fortunate . . . . . . and that i' ve been blessed in many ways .
must be nice being you , richard .
i got no complaints .
it all checked out .
he filed a report about the boots .
and made a big fuss to the principal .
yeah , i bet he was a pain in the ass .
she didn' t say that .
no , believe me .
i hate kids like that .
like what ?
what about the study session ?
six kids were at his house with him from 7 or 7 : 30 thursday evening . . . . . . till 3 a . m .
friday .
i talked to all of them .
he was there except for 1 5 minutes . . . . . . he went to an atm to get cash for a pizza .
did you check that out ?
1 9 .
get that enhanced .
why ?
because i can' t see his face .
it' s him .
i can' t see his face .
you really think he' s involved ?
i don' t know .
but something' s not right with that kid .
fifteen minutes .
it doesn' t give him enough time .
he has to drive to covington , kill her , dump her body , get back .
he' d need at least an hour .
they questioned me .
and ?
it was so cool !
did they go for the shoes ?
they grabbed it .
i was so good .
i really was .
listen .
this can ' t be about my shoes .
why not ?
did you find them ?
you sure they didn' t suspect anything ?
you didn' t overdo it ?
a little bit .
i overdid it a little bit .
you think the person who stole my shoes committed this murder ?
i want you to know i' m gonna cooperate in any way i can .
meet me at the bluff tonight .
i can' t .
why not ?
i have something to do .
like what ?
i' il tell you later .
i should . . . .
know who his father is ?
i wanna search his house .
lawrence haywood .
he built the mall .
big campaign contributor ?
that' s right .
and i won' t fuck with that guy on this .
i' ve grown much too fond of my own ass to do anything that goddamned stupid !
and what is your problem ?
where are you on this , sam ?
i don' t care who his father is .
i don' t mean that .
do you think we have enough to go after him ?
no .
and if we go in too soon , we could burn the whole case .
really ?
and why is that , vice ?
no judge would sign a warrant based on what you have .
shut up , swanson !
this kid with his attitude ...
attitude isn' t a crime .
it' s an indicator ...
but he doesn' t fit the profile .
the profile doesn' t fit !
the killer was smart .
he didn' t drive to the site , he used richard' s boots . . . . . . but the attack was unplanned ?
but if we push too soon ...
whose case is this ?
just calm down .
no , i' ve been trying to find olivia' s killer , busting my ass ...
who' s olivia ?
the victim .
is this still my case ?
it' s a coordinated effort !
you' re getting way too involved in this , cassie .
cassie !
what ?
you called her by her first name .
what ?
you said , " i' ve been trying to find olivia' s killer .
no , i didn' t .
did i ?
you' re supposed to be identifying with the killer , not the victim .
remember that ?
you don ' t have any witnesses or fingerprints or powder burns ...
i almost forgot .
tobias always kept a gun , right here .
loaded .
can i come in ?
listen , i' m sorry i didn' t back you up in there .
i' m a big girl .
you said what you thought , right ?
yes , but ...
then you did the right thing .
we can' t just bust in there ...
i know .
i heard you .
so can you get out of the way ?
know what your problem is ?
yeah , you' re blocking matlock .
out of the way .
please .
i' m trying to apologize here .
all right , apology accepted .
you want to sit down ?
you want to have a cookie ?
hi .
hi .
what' s going on ?
we' re making up .
we' re still friends , right ?
what' s this ?
i don' t know , let' s find out .
we do this and you throw me out again ?
or you stay .
or you leave .
i don' t know .
it' s hard to tell in advance .
what do you want ?
you want promises ?
you want a ring ?
is that what you want ?
a ring ?
don' t !
look , it' s not just about sex , okay ?
i really respect you as a person .
is that what you ... ?
why do you always want to hurt people ?
i wouldn' t say always .
it kind of happens sometimes .
you' re so good at breaking other people down . . . . . . but you never stop and look at yourself .
where are you taking me ?
no peeking , we' re almost there .
step up .
okay .
open your eyes .
my god , justin , this is beautiful !
did you grow these ?
what happened ?
you' re different .
yeah , i am different .
mayweather .
collect call from an inmate in a corrections facility .
the name of the inmate is ...
carl hudson .
if you wish to accept , press ...
i do not wish to accept any calls ...
cassie ?
what ?
it' s sam .
hi , i' m sorry .
what can i do for you ?
remember the puke at the body dump ?
yeah .
most of it was unidentifiable . . . . . . but kevin managed to isolate some partially digested eggs .
fish eggs .
caviar ?
apparently so .
i' ve compiled a list of the local vendors selling caviar .
what was his name ?
richard haywood .
miles haywood' s kid ?
he came in once around christmas .
not last week ?
thursday ?
i rarely see any high school kids here .
except justin pendleton .
who ?
he used to come with his father , but his parents split .
now he comes in alone .
he' s a senior at jefferson .
richard' s a senior at jefferson .
justin eats alone ?
he always brings a book .
he' s a bit of a loner .
but a brilliant kid , you should hear him talk .
when was he in here last ?
the 5th .
7 : 30 p . m .
what time did he leave ?
about 9 .
do you know what he ate ?
justin ?
cassie mayweather , with the san benito police .
you' re a police officer ?
i' m a homicide investigator .
can i ask you a couple questions ?
sure .
you had dinner at maison saint croix on the 5th ?
maison saint croix .
thank you .
the 5th was a thursday , and they had a caviar appetizer .
did you have it ?
yeah , i might have .
can you tell me what happened ?
do you know richard haywood ?
everyone knows him .
is he involved in this ?
is he a friend of yours ?
no .
i mean , i tutored him for his bio sat last year , but we' re not . . . .
we don' t have much in common .
are you in his study group ?
no .
what study group ?
when you left the restaurant , did you take leftovers ?
you didn' t give your friends at the study group leftovers ?
look , i told you , i barely know him .
he makes fun of me in class .
why would he do that ?
because . . . . . . he' s like that .
he makes fun of everyone .
he' s one of the cool kids .
what makes him cool ?
you know , he' s smart , he' s rich . . . . . . he' s witty , and everyone likes him .
and you don' t .
yeah , i knew kids like that .
superstars of high school .
five years from now , nobody will care who they are .
well , richard will always be cool .
his daddy' s rich and i hate to admit it , but he' s actually smart .
he' s lazy and didn' t study , but he got a 71 0 on that bio sat .
it kind of spun me out .
spinning out , huh ?
you seem to know him well .
you can tell by his behavior in class .
sorry .
cassie , where have you been ?
sam i. d. ' d the suspect .
who is it ?
ask sam .
he' s in charge of the case .
s. i. d. is over there now collecting evidence .
hi , cass .
hi .
look at this , sir .
could be a match .
log that .
i want samples of fabrics , soils , any molds , plants in here and outside .
john' s found a stash of marijuana buds .
you mind if we smoke up while we work ?
yes , i do .
so who is he ?
raymond lee feathers .
he' s a janitor at jefferson .
i compiled a list of everyone who might have stolen richard' s boots .
then i cross indexed that against carpet purchases and up came this .
apparently he sold grass to the kids at school .
good work .
thank you .
where is he ?
i don' t know .
seems like he took off .
did you run him for priors ?
a couple duls , one pot bust .
but he hasn' t shown up for work since the day we talked to richard there .
did you find the boots ?
not yet , but we may have a match on the yellow carpet fibers .
we' ve nothing on the vehicle fibers till we find his car . . . . . . but he' s got a stash of porno films , mostly bondage . . . . . . just like the profile .
what ?
he' s not a neatness freak .
what are you saying ?
sloppy enough to leave footprints , but smart enough to steal shoes in advance ?
this is our guy , no question .
you find any caviar jars ?
come on , wait a minute .
you' re ticked that i got him , aren' t you ?
no .
if you got him , i' m happy for you .
after we close this case , maybe we should look for different partners .
might be better .
whatever you want .
good .
nice work , guys .
i gotta take a piss .
don' t worry , i won' t contaminate any evidence .
she pees standing up , that one .
al .
don' t talk about her like that , please .
you' ve slept with her already ?
what ?
you will .
that' s cassie' s m . o .
she lets you get close , then pushes you away .
ask her what' s wrong , she picks a fight .
you' re working with her . . . . . . because no one else will .
looks like a body dump .
now we know where that baboon hair came from .
it' s okay .
hey , lisa .
you want a ride ?
we already did that .
that' s not what i' m talking about .
i want to talk to you .
want me to beg ?
please .
you' il get in an accident .
please .
i don' t care .
you make me sad .
come on .
come on .
it' s fun in here .
hello , justin .
how you doing ?
what are you ... ?
what are you doing here ?
you stood me up for that slut ?
lisa ?
she' s not a slut .
did you tell her anything about us ?
of course not .
of course not .
you fuck her ?
i was helping her with her physics .
you fucked her , and i saw you .
we kissed .
you kissed .
that was it , i swear .
oh , justin .
you helped lisa , and you didn' t even get laid ?
what a schmuck .
she' s not like that .
bullshit .
she spreads like peanut butter .
you' d be surprised what a girl without a dad will do for male attention .
lisa .
do you hate me ?
i had to do it .
i don ' t want to hurt you , but i had to show you what she' s really like .
she' s not good enough for you .
she doesn ' t appreciate you .
she' s like your mom , dad and everyone else .
i' m the only person who really cares about you .
i think i' m the only person who sees how incredible you really are .
don' t go away , justin .
come on .
what we did . . .
. . . together . . . . . . how many people have done that ?
we proved something to each other .
we showed what we' re capable of .
there' s no limits for men like us .
did you hear about ray ?
they' re onto him .
just one last thing to do and we' re home free , right ?
do we have to ?
you tell me .
do we have to ?
richard ?
is that you ?
did you bring the pom poms ?
i brought something to help you sleep .
what the fuck ? !
my physics test .
i got a b + .
you are a genius .
don' t .
i have something for you .
what is this ?
you' re quite the slut .
what ?
what ? !
how long has he been here ?
nurse on the night shift said he came in about 4 .
how are you feeling ?
i' m okay .
i' m a little sore , but . . . .
what are you doing here ?
i figured you' d want an immediate report .
yeah , i do .
so ?
we got everything .
excellent .
the boots ?
that' s an affirmative .
and a pair of tin snips , and a phillips head , traces of blood .
and a finger , right ?
was it in a jar behind a stack of magazines . . . . . . or in the freezer under the turkey thigh ?
behind the vanilla fudge ice cream .
good work .
all you need now is a confession .
there won' t be one .
feathers committed suicide last night .
suicide ?
yeah .
it was a gun to the head .
powder burns , gsr on his right hand .
ever heard of a ritual mutilator , an impulsive serial type killer . . . . . . committing suicide ?
don' t do that .
i can' t think of one .
psychos want to get caught .
lie down .
i' m actually feeling a lot better , thank you .
these kids did this .
they' re not even hiding it .
they want us to know .
so let' s get to know them a little better .
turn around .
we got ray on this .
why did he run if he didn' t do it ?
there' s a reason .
are you jealous because i got him . . . . . . or are you so obsessed with richard you' re not thinking ?
i' m sorry ...
you' ve been angling for this for a while , taking over the case !
they made me take it because they think you' re losing it !
who thinks i' m losing it ?
who ?
rod ?
i don' t care if i' m losing it .
i' m right .
how did you come by this ?
it was the weirdest thing .
i was driving by the house . . . . . . the trash can got knocked over , and the stuff fell out .
what a break .
some of this will be the mom' s , some will be the boy' s .
what is this ?
don' t ask , don' t tell .
we won' t know until we get the report if it matches the puke' s dna .
lucky he gave us some blood with his dinner .
be sure to get a signed purchase order .
when will we know ?
depends on the lab .
want me to call him ?
no !
last time i had to calm him down .
just make it fast .
i' il take care of it .
see you .
what' s this ?
a purchase order for the dna ...
i know what it is .
this case is closed .
closed !
now , if you can' t understand that , then maybe we ...
you need some time off ?
nope , i' m fine .
you' re not fine .
you' re brilliant sometimes , but never really fine .
you want to see doc sluzer again ?
no .
then no more on this case .
not another minute , not another penny .
i' ve about had it with you .
you hear me ?
hi , it' s cass .
i' il need another day or two on that purchase order .
no , just bookkeeping , changing the software , things like that .
so you' il run an analysis on that puke ?
thanks , honey .
i' m sorry .
i shouldn' t have done it .
come on !
you threw up ?
why didn' t you tell me ?
i don' t remember doing it .
he doesn' t remember .
what if they i. d. you ?
with the dna , can they do that ?
i doubt it .
the stomach acids usually eat away ...
you doubt it ?
i doubt it .
it could put us in the electric chair !
gas chamber .
what ?
california uses a gas chamber .
that' s very informative .
it doesn' t matter .
no , thank you .
you told her you tutor me too ?
what are you thinking ?
if she found out on her own . . . . . . and i hadn' t mentioned it , it would look even worse !
they have nothing .
they have nothing on me .
don' t worry , i' m not a backstabber like you , richard .
how am i a back ... ?
i' m not the one talking , giving away all the information . . . . . . trying to get us caught because i' m a bitch !
don' t talk to me like that .
i' il talk to you how i want to .
i trust you with forensic stuff , and you have no idea what you' re talking about !
you' re supposed to be smart !
stop .
no , you' re not smart , you' re dumb !
stop !
i' m sorry .
come here .
that' s a good boy .
you' re not still mad about that girl , are you ?
let' s just stick together and stay calm until this is over , okay ?
and then what ?
and then what ?
justin ?
where are you going ?
we can' t be seen together .
do you think this is some kind of game ?
come on , come on .
this is sam kennedy .
i' m not here to take your call ...
what are you doing here ?
what are you doing here ?
do you want something ?
like what ?
i don' t know .
everybody wants something , don' t they ?
do they ?
they just don' t know how to ask for it .
what do you want ?
richard , get out of the way .
you think i' m too young ?
there was a killer at your school .
the whole time , somebody you were close to .
what do you mean ?
raymond feathers .
you guys were friends , right ?
with that degenerate ?
no .
he didn' t really have many friends .
he just . . . .
i don' t know .
you know , even his old lady left him .
so you' re friends with his old lady too ?
you' re a tease .
you lead guys on and then push them away .
but i think . . . . . . you like to fight .
you want it , but you need to fight about it .
no .
you don' t have to do anything .
you have no choice .
you can' t handle it , so you' re leaving ?
this is part of it !
damn it !
thank you , detective .
i bet you did this with every guy you ever dated .
tell me i' m wrong .
lf i can link richard to feathers ...
you can' t stop .
i' m sorry about what i said .
i' m just a little messed up right now , but hear me out , as a friend .
just as a friend , okay ?
thank you .
i saw richard and justin tonight .
they lied , they know each other .
really ?
they barely have parents .
they' re like orphans with credit cards .
school' s too easy .
they don' t have jobs or chores .
nothing' s expected of them .
nothing they do matters .
so they figured , " why not kill somebody ?
maybe i' m wrong , but tell rod you want to keep the case open .
what happened between you and richard tonight ?
did you hit him ?
in the face ?
no .
no , it wasn' t like that , it was ...
it was an acci ...
rod knows ?
he got a call from richard' s father .
he' il make you see the department shrink about this .
no .
no shrink .
it' s not gonna work .
i know what i am .
i' m just not ...
okay .
so nobody wants to work with me ?
that' s okay .
but i' m a good cop .
and if what i say is right , and we let these kids go , and they do it again . . . .
so please just talk to rod , you' re the only one he' il listen to .
i' il call him in the morning .
call him now , he' s still up .
back off !
if rod says yes . . . . . . maybe you could even hang around the school and make them nervous .
we have papers due tomorrow , no excuses .
support your conclusions , having a thesis isn' t enough .
i want real arguments with quotations and sources .
sam kennedy , san benito police .
nice to meet you .
lisa !
sam kennedy , from san benito police .
start time .
let' s see . . . .
it' s me .
i know how they did it .
now we need to know why .
i can help with that .
i got someone here you ought to talk to .
rod , look at the dna .
the vomit is a perfect match with justin .
who paid for this ?
cassie , out of her own pocket .
you' d need a jury of 1 2 forensic experts .
that' s why we need a confession from one of them .
they' il talk without an attorney ?
they want to prove they' re smarter than we are .
okay .
so where' s the other one ?
who ?
the hot one .
not here .
you get to work with her everyday ?
yeah .
i should become a cop .
so , what' s up with ray ?
i hear he' s like a serial killer or something .
well , actually , we have a theory on that .
it involves you and justin .
it' s just a theory .
can i lay it out for you ?
yeah .
therefore . . . . . . every truly free act is a crime , for crime sets one apart . . . . . . from the machinery of mass society .
it can' t be a crime of profit or passion , but gratuitous and random .
crime as philosophy , as freedom .
interesting .
do you believe it ?
it' s a school paper .
you have to write something .
i enjoy taking indefensible positions and creating an argument for them .
but do you believe it ?
so then the question is , how did you pick the victim ?
was it random ?
i mean , that' s the way i' d do it .
that one right there , with the flowers .
she' s perfect .
no , she' s too skinny .
you understand what random means ?
we don' t choose .
don' t talk to me like i' m a moron .
we have to follow the plan ...
this one !
what about this one ?
don' t get impatient .
wait a second .
pull up , where the girl is loading the groceries .
okay .
but you lose the point of a philosophical crime if you feel guilty .
how do you mean ?
if you kill somebody to prove you' re free , and then throw up ...
i didn' t .
what are you talking about ?
richard didn' t feel guilty .
he' s free , justin .
you' re not .
relax .
let them wonder what we' re up to .
now go in .
your coffee .
you can' t smoke in here .
come on .
are we almost done ?
take a seat .
so ray was an inspired choice .
but the great thing . . . . . . was how subtly you planted the fibers and hairs and stuff .
i got your product .
you did ray , right ?
wasn' t he your friend ?
you told him to hide in his trailer , didn' t you ?
what are you talking about ?
you went home , you said hello to your mother .
it took you 1 0 minutes to walk home from the restaurant .
mother , i' m home .
you said you had to do schoolwork so she wouldn ' t look in .
and she didn ' t .
she never did , did she ?
i was with six friends all night .
you know that .
you talked to them .
the night , sure , but not the day .
that' s the secret .
you weren' t there at night .
the thing that always confused me was the muddy footprints in the house .
you know ?
the planting bed was dry , so where did they come from ?
it was you at the house .
justin would not have walked through the wet beds .
that was exactly 3 : 30 .
how long did you wait for her to come home ?
you didn ' t kill her there .
i gotta say , that was a stroke of genius .
did you think it up , or was it justin ?
i don' t know what you' re saying .
that helped us figure out the real timetable .
that gave you time to get home for the study group .
i' il go get some cash for the pizza .
you told them you were going to the a tm to get cash .
and you did .
and i did .
then you hurried back .
that took five minutes .
it took five minutes .
now we' re talking .
but you were gone 1 5 .
what are you looking at ?
richard killed her .
didn' t he , justin ?
i think it was justin .
let me tell you something .
it' il be the most important thing you ever hear .
more important than the instructions on the sats and aps .
the person who actually killed olivia lake is gonna be executed .
or , at best , go to jail for life .
in your case that' d be about 60 years .
but the other one , who didn' t actually kill her , if he cooperates . . .
. . . will have a chance at a real life .
richard was back in the study group by 9 : 25 .
so you must have dumped the body .
the planning was easy ... ... but now you had to actually do it .
and that' s why the postmortem wounds were so tentative .
you were trying to be like richard , but you couldn' t .
you weren' t that free .
thank god .
go to hell .
my guy won' t roll .
i figured he' d be the one .
no .
let' s talk about lisa .
she went out with richard ?
briefly .
then she got interested in justin .
let' s use that .
interesting theory , but i can' t admit to something i didn' t do .
looks like you won' t have to .
because justin is talking in there .
justin' s here ?
he told us about you .
about you and lisa .
which lisa ?
so you really need to tell me what happened .
just think of it as a game .
whoever talks first is the winner .
justin says you betrayed him .
he told us about lisa and the tape you made .
justin' s talking .
he' s gonna win this thing , unless you have something to tell me .
okay , i' m gonna go see .
wait , wait .
come on , sit down .
i have to advise you of certain rights .
the interview is over .
richard' s father' s lawyer .
charge them or let them go .
another five minutes , we would have had both those kids .
if i ever find out who leaked to the parents , i swear . . . .
no , that' s all right .
yeah , i' il talk to you tomorrow .
justin won' t talk , because he needs to prove he' s as tough as his buddy .
he' s tougher .
yeah , maybe .
that richard , i can' t wait till we nail him .
one of them is the doer , and he' s going down , but there' s something deeper ...
a narcissistic prick like richard doesn' t care about anyone but himself .
he uses justin to feed his ego .
push him around , make him feel like a man .
in five years , no one will care he was homecoming king . . . . . . or pole vaulting champ .
i pity anyone who gets in his way .
is richard a pole vaulter ?
i don' t know .
i was using it as an example of , you know . . . .
look . . . .
i know about carl hudson .
where did you get that ?
this is none of your god ...
this is my matter !
mine !
i knew this girl in high school . . . . . . smart enough . . . . . . but she didn' t really come from anything .
and to everyone' s amazement , the most popular boy liked her .
state pole vaulting champ .
you' d watch him go over that bar in the sunlight . . . . . . that golden body , it was like . . . . . . life just couldn' t get any more beautiful than that .
and it didn' t .
she was 1 6 when she married him .
seventeen when he knocked out her upper bicuspid .
eighteen when she decided to leave .
he put her in the hospital with a serious concussion .
a week later , when she got out . . . . . . she started packing , and he was drunk .
he pointed his finger at her .
he said , " you try that again , i' il kill you .
he took another drink . . . . . . and she headed for the door .
why didn' t she wait till he was out ?
left for work ?
she couldn' t , she had to go right then .
why then ?
i don' t know .
it was because . . . .
because she . . . .
it wasn' t about getting away from him , it was about standing up to him .
even if it killed her .
i guess so .
so he stabbed her 1 7 times with a kitchen knife . . . . . . and dumped her body on a country road .
yeah , ruined my favorite dress .
carl hudson .
cutest boy i ever saw . . . . . . until richard haywood .
and you' re supposed to testify at carl' s parole hearing .
what are you gonna say ?
nothing .
i' m not going .
i' m not .
you gotta go up there , you have to .
no .
i don' t have to .
the girl was jessica marie hudson .
i have nothing to say about her .
you just inherited her scars .
look , i made a deal .
the deal was that she died there .
she' s in the ground , and i can go on with my life .
except you can' t .
all you think about is carl hudson .
he' s every case .
he' s every guy you date .
your whole world is carl hudson .
is that the life you' re going on with ?
did you ever get help for any of this ?
yeah .
i became a cop .
you can' t just pretend it didn' t happen .
it' s not that simple , cass .
it has to be .
because if it gets any more complicated , i can' t make it .
richard haywood is on line one .
swanson .
so you want to talk to me about this covington woman ?
yes , i know all about it .
what can i do for you ?
i just thought you' d want to know what really happened .
i thought it was a game .
how do you pick a victim ?
how do you get away with it ?
we were bored .
i never took it seriously until i walk in the room , and she' s laying there . . . .
did you make a deal with him ?
he says he wasn' t there ...
did you make a deal ?
i don' t make deals over the phone , but if it checks out . . . . . . and we can get a conviction , i will .
fine .
let' s get warrants now .
where are you going ?
you' re not supposed to leave without telling us .
will you be back for dinner ?
justin' s not here .
his mother doesn' t even know when he left .
similar story here .
what about goldilocks ?
get over there and see what she knows .
you should take a look downstairs .
i gotta go .
bye .
i didn' t know where else to go .
tell me what' s going on .
the cops are asking about you and richard .
i don' t know what to say .
we killed a woman .
no , you didn' t .
yes , we did .
he made you do it .
it wasn' t just richard .
but he drove it .
it was his idea .
you would have never done anything like this by yourself .
he seduced you . . .
. . . just like he seduced me .
you know what you have to do .
you have to tell them everything .
i will .
i don' t have any feelings left .
except for you .
that' s him .
don' t answer it .
where are you ?
are you with her ?
no .
yes , you are .
and you told her about us , didn ' t you ?
did you tell her everything ?
where are you ?
i left home .
all right ?
i' m gone .
i' m never going back .
it' s over .
i know .
we have to turn ourselves in .
and go to prison ?
and be punks ?
and eat shit for the rest of our lives ? !
do you remember what we talked about ?
yes .
meet me at the bluff in an hour .
okay ?
okay .
i have to meet him .
to do what ?
i just have to .
i wish i met you first .
cassie mayweather .
have a seat .
so this is what we talked about .
glory or nothing .
should we say the words for the last time ?
one cannot live fully without embracing suicide and crime .
say it .
a pact made with relentless fire that requires that while some live . . . . . . others die .
on three .
one .
two .
three .
what are you doing ?
i have the bullets , right ?
what about you ?
open your chamber .
open it !
you were gonna watch me kill myself ?
they' re here at the old wintu lodge .
roger .
that' s up off highland road ?
so since i have the bullets and the guts to use them . . . . . . i' il shoot you , and then i' il shoot myself , okay ?
no .
no ?
why ?
would you rather go to prison and be a punk ?
or do you think you' il beat prison ?
because you made a deal .
you talked .
you talked !
why don' t you shoot me ?
shoot me in the head , in the heart .
whatever you want .
do it .
doesn' t matter anymore .
pull the fucking trigger .
pull it !
come on !
justin , don' t .
we have to pay for what we did .
not like that .
put the gun down .
put it down .
please don' t .
justin , listen to me .
for me .
come over here , next to me .
don' t listen to her .
don' t !
hands off !
stay put .
people are on the way .
hey , richard ?
you think you' re so smart , huh ?
justin' s smarter than you , remember that .
i got one left .
to hell with it .
... every night , the same fucking thing ?
listen !
listen to me !
you are not going out that door , jess !
you are not going out that door !
justin , please !
justin , please .
don' t !
justin !
justin , don' t !
no , no !
don' t !
grab it .
i got it .
thank you , thank you .
i' m okay , thank you .
what' s gonna happen to me ?
since you weren' t the actual killer , and what you did down there for me . . . .
don' t worry about it , i' il take care of you .
you all right ?
whisper something into my ear .
what ?
just anything .
remember what i said about looking for new partners ?
are you serious ?
where was it ?
i want to take that back .
did they find the videotape ?
yes .
how' s he doing ?
he looks okay .
but we' re gonna transport him for treatment .
why did you let richard videotape the killing ?
that was really stupid , like you guys wanted to get caught .
what are you talking about ?
oh , you don' t know ?
they found a hidden camera in richard' s basement .
that' s how he filmed himself with lisa .
he filmed the killing too .
the d. a. is looking at it now .
look , whatever is on that tape . . . .
whatever' s on that tape what ?
is there really a tape ?
maybe i should talk to a lawyer .
absolutely .
no , wait a second .
wait !
i thought richard manipulated you , but it was the other way around .
these marks are from richard' s ring when he tried to strangle me .
there are none of these marks on olivia' s neck .
richard could have taken off that ring to make it look like ray did it .
the ring has nothing to do with it .
tell me what happened . . . . . . and i' il do my best to get you tried as a juvenile .
you have to believe me .
when i went over there , i had no idea .
i never thought i' d ...
oh , god .
are you gonna do it or what ?
i can' t .
fuck ... !
so , what , i have to do it ?
you don' t do anything .
you just have ideas .
and you' re so full of shit too .
crime is not an idea , it' s an act .
anybody can think it .
only free men can do it .
i' m free .
give me the gloves .
give them to me .
thank you .
i had to show him .
i could have let you die up there , but i didn' t .
thank you .
wait !
i just want a chance .
i wanna start over .
i wanna ...
it doesn' t work that way .
you get one life .
and whatever you do with it , whatever' s done to you . . . . . . you gotta face that .
you can' t pretend it didn' t happen .
jessica marie hudson ?
jessica marie hudson .
for the carl hudson parole hearing ?
jessica marie hudson ?
that' s me .
