oh , hello .
my dad' il kill me if he knows i' m here .
he stopped you comin ' to classes .
it' s not his fault , miss .
that' s all right with you , is it ?
i suppose so .
you should stand up to him .
you don' t know what he' s like .
well , that blows it .
blows what , miss ?
debbie ?
i' ve heard a lot about you .
durham' s little gene kelly , eh ?
your dad work down the pit , then ?
yeah .
must be hard for the family being out on strike .
he is out on strike , isn' t he ?
' course .
i shouldn' t worry .
it won' t last long .
tom , don' t .
if they had a ballot , they' d be back tomorrow .
it' s just a few bloody commies stirrin ' things up .
let' s face it .
they haven' t got a leg to stand on .
who doesn' t ?
the miners .
it stands to reason , doesn' t it ?
some pits are just uneconomical .
if it costs more money topay everybody ... to dig the coalout than you get for the coal when you sell it , what does that tell ya ?
don' t know .
you wanna think about that , don' t you , son ?
tom .
if it was up to me , i' d shut the lot of' em down tomorrow .
for god' s sake .
what do you do , mr. wilkinson ?
he' s been made redundant .
i thought he was gonna hit me or somethin ' .
don' t besilly .
he' s just under a lot of pressure .
that' s what mam says .
i think it' s because he drinks too much .
does he drink too much ?
he' s always pissed .
once he pissed himself .
your dad ?
because he' s unhappy , because they sleep in separate beds .
why do they sleep in separate beds ?
so they can' t have sex .
do they not have sex ?
dad did it with this woman from work , but they don' t think i know .
do you miss your mam , then ?
don' t really miss her as such .
it' s more like just feelin ' sad .
especially when i remember her all of a sudden .
when i forgot that she was dead and that .
what about your mam ?
does she not have sex ?
no , she' s unfulfilled .
that' s why she does dancin ' .
she does dancin ' instead of sex ?
your family' s weird .
no , they' re not .
they are , though .
they' re mental .
ow !
get off !
wow
see ?
you' re a nutter , you .
debbie !
it' s time for billy to go home !
come on , billy .
i' il drop you off at the corner .
i' il see ya , debbie .
okay , then .
miss , what have i blown ?
this' il sound strange , billy , but for some time now ...
i' ve been thinkin ' of the royal ballet school .
aren' t you a bit old , miss ?
ooh , not me .
you !
i' m the bloody teacher !
they hold auditions in newcastle .
i' d never be good enough .
i hardly know aught .
they' re not interested in how much ballet you know .
they' il teach you that .
that' s why they' re a ballet school .
it' s how you move and how you express yourself that' s important .
express what ?
i think you' re good enough to go for it .
it would mean an awful lot of hard work .
but i' m banned .
then maybe i should have a word with him .
no , miss !
i could teach you on your own , if you want .
we couldn' t afford it .
i' m not doin ' it for the money , billy .
but what about dad ?
he doesn' t need to know .
what about me boxin ' ?
oh , for fuck' s sake , billy !
ifyou want to piss about with your little mates , that' s fine with me .
all right , don' t lose your blob .
blob " ?
so we could do it private like ?
just you and me .
miss , you don' t fancy me , do you ?
no , billy , funnily enough , i don' t .
now , piss off .
piss off , yourself .
see you monday , then .
are you comin ' in or what ?
what are you doin ' ?
nothin ' .
just dressin ' up .
whose dress is that ?
come on .
whose dress is that ?
it' s me sister' s .
did she give you it ?
she doesn' t know .
do you wanna try ?
you can have one of me mam' s .
nah .
you' re all right .
what' re you doin ' that for ?
i' m just tryin ' it on .
christ .
come here .
stay still .
there .
won' t we get in trouble ?
don' t be stupid .
me dad does it all the time .
he dresses up in your mam' s clothes ?
only when he thinks everybody' s out .
have you got a tutu yet ?
do you think being a ballet dancer ... would be better than being a miner ?
ldon' t know .
it' s just , i' ve got this audition in newcastle in a couple ofweeks .
what for ?
for to go to ballet school .
ballet school ?
ls that in newcastle ?
london .
you' d have to move , with your tony and everybody ?
no .
by meself .
that' s a bit steep .
can' t you be a ballet dancer here ?
don' t be stupid !
so , when you goin ' there , then ?
i don' t know .
i haven' t even got in yet .
what does your dad say ?
he doesn' t know .
fuckin ' hell !
are you not going to tell him ?
not yet , anyway .
he might be pleased about it .
he could rent your room out .
he couldn' t .
what about our tony ?
what do you reckon ?
i think you shouldn' t bother .
why not ?
i' d miss you .
fuckin ' hell .
brought your things ?
i don' t know if they' re right , miss .
if they' re special to you , they' re right .
what are they for ?
to give us some ideas for a dance .
come on , then .
let' s see ' em .

i can see it' s a letter .
it' s me mam' s .
she wrote it for when i was 18 , but i opened it .

which is probably a good thing .
it will have been a long time ,

she becomes real again .
and then one night ... she meets this young prince , and he falls in love with her .
and she realizes ... this is the one thing that will allow her ... to become a real woman once more .

i' ve been in a fuckin ' cell all night , and you come around here talkin ' shite !
and you !
fuckin ' ballet !
what are you trying to do , make him a fuckin ' skirt for the rest of his life ?
look at him !
he' s only 11 , for fuck' s sake !
you' ve gotta start trainin ' from when you' re young .
shut it !
i' m not havin ' any brother of mine running around like a twat for your gratification .
excuse me .
this is not for my gratification .
what good' s it gonna do him ?
you' re not takin ' him away .
he' s only a bairn .
what about givin ' him a childhood ?
i don' t want a childhood .
i want to be a ballet dancer .
what do you know about it ?
what qualifications have you got ?
i haven' t come here to defend meself .
for all we know , you could besome fuckin ' nutter .
get the fuckin ' social on to you .
you should calm yourself down , son .
you say he can dance .

he' s got the chance to dance .
now you' re fuckin ' tellin ' him not to .

so piss off .
he' s not doin ' any more fuckin ' ballet , and if you go near him again , i' il smac kyou , you middle class cow !

stop dreaming of the quiet life
he won' t grow up to race whippets or grow leeks ... or piss his wages up the wall .
he' s been with me
well , stop apologizing for the things you' ve neverdone
time is short and life is cruel
but it' s up to us to change this town called malice
rows and rows of disused milk floats stand dying in the dairy yard
anda hundred lonely housewives clutch empty milk bottles to their hearts
hanging out their old love letters on the line to dry
it' s enough to make you stop believing
when tears come fast and furious in a town called malice
yeah
ba ba ba ba ba da ba
ba ba ba da ba oh
ba ba ba ba ba da ba ba ba ba da ba
struggle after struggle year after year
the atmosphere' s a fine blend ofice
i' m almost stone cold dead in a town called malice
ooh yeah
a whole street' s belief in sunday' s roast beef
gets dashed against the co op
to either cut down the beer or the kids ' new gear
it' s a big decision in a town called malice
ooh yeah
ah !
ooh billy !
billy !
the ghost of a steam train echoes down my track
it' s at the moment bound for nowhere
just going round and round , oh
playground kids and creaking swings
lost laughter in the breeze
i could go for hours and i probably will
but i' d sooner put some joy back in this town calledm alice
yeah
ooh ooh
town called malice
yeah , yeah

oh you bent bastard !
what on earth' s going on here ?
how did it go ?
shit !
mr. elliot , i' m afraid that mutual respect ... and self discipline are absolute prerequisites for any pupilin this school .
such displays of violence cannot be tolerated under any circumstances .
doy ou understand ?
i realize we shall have to consider this very seriously ... and it will be bound to affect our final decision .
yes , well , just a few questions , then .
billy , can you tell us ... why you first became interested in ballet ?
don' t know .
just was .
well , was there any ... particular aspect of the ballet which ... caught your imagination ?
the dancin ' .
he dances all the time .
every night after school .
yes .
well , we have a very enthusiastic letter ... from mrs. wilkinson , and , uh , she has told us ... of your personal circumstances .
mr. elliot , are you a fan of the ballet ?
i wouldn' t exactly say i was an expert .
you do realize that all pupils ... must attain the highest standards , not just in ballet but in their ordinary academic work .
no child can succeed without the 100 % support of the family .
you are completely behind billy ?
are you not ?
yes .
yes , ofcourse .
do you want to ask us some questions ?
no , not not really , no .
well , in that case , we shall let you know in due course .
just one last question .
can i ask you , billy , what does it feel like ... when you' re dancing ?
don' t know .
sort of feels good .
it' s sort of stiff and that , but once i get goin ' , then i , like , forget everythin ' .
and ... sort of disappear .
sort of disappear .
like i feel a change in me whole body .
like there' s fire in me body .
i' m just there , flyin ' ...
iike a bird .
like electricity .
yeah .
like electricity .
have a safe journey home .
mr. elliot , good luck with the strike .
toast !
i think you should get yourself a trade , son .
somethin ' useful .
i could have been a professional dancer .
what happened to the dinosaurs , miss ?
they were crushed as well , and the pressure of all of this cause dthe plants and trees to change into coal .
ow !
that' s what must have happened to her .
michaei caffrey , if you have got something to say , you can say it to the class .
sorry , miss .

wouldy ou believe me if i said i' d never lie
though it ain' t easy i can tell you i have tried
but i gotta say that it comes those days
that i told something untrue
would you forgive me if i said i' d lied to you
this is my fear to tell you what i' ve done
as things come clear i' m afraid that you' il begone
but ail i know is if you go
at least i' ve told what' s true
hope you' il forgive me when i say i' ve lied to you
