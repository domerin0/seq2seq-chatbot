are you listening to me ?
you must escape from here tonight .
it' s your only chance to stay alive .
if you follow my instructions and make it out of the camp ... ... travel when it' s dark to flee bulgaria so you won' t be seen .
they' il be everywhere waiting to arrest you ... ... and unless you' re very careful , you' il be caught .
if you make it across the border , you must get this envelope to denmark .
first , head south to salonika and hide on a ship that' s going to italy .
when you arrive there , travel north as far as you can .
your journey will be long and it may be impossible ... ... but you must get this evelope to the authorities in denmark .
you must not open it .
if anyone sees it' s contents before you get there ... ... you' il end up back here .
do you understand ?
i know you' ve lived in this camp your entire life ... ... but there is a world outside it .
however , it' s a very dangerous world .
trust no one .
when the time comes , get from the barracks to the west fence .
when you see the signal , you will have 30 seconds to get over the fence ... ... before the current is turned back on .
shoot me .
hidden behind the log at the edge of the field ... ... you will find a bunndle filled with items you will need for your journey .
if you follow my instructions and make it out of the camp ... ... travel when it' s dark to flee bulgaria so you won' t be seen .
you must do everything i just told you if you want to escape .
they' re moving me to another camp tomorrow ... ... and i can no longer watch over you .
follow your compass south to salonika .
travel there by any means possible .
who did it ?
get out !
get out now !
you want to escape this paradise ?
are you that ungrateful ?
the border between bulgaria and greece is heavily gurarded ... ... and much of the fence is strung with alarm wires .
do not touch it .
stop him !
stop him !
stop , little boy !
come back here !
come back !
stop !
where do you think you' re going ?
you cannot escape !
stop !
we will get you !
stop !
stop !
we will get you !
follow your compass south to salonika ... ... and hide on a ship that' s going to italy .
don' t worry .
i' il take care of it .
okay .
good work .
hey !
why isn' t this hatch closed ?
johannes ... ... am i dead ?
no .
i don' t think i can make it .
they' re going to find me .
not if you' re careful .
you must remain unseen .
and if you are seen , you must blend in with the people around you .
how ?
you know many languages from the different men you knew in the camp .
just listen closely and you' il be able to speak to people ... ... and understand them .
i' m afraid .
there are places where the world is good .
i' ve seen them .
a long time ago , but i have seen them .
you will , too .
why didn' t you come with me ?
this is your journey .
i have my own .
but what am i looking for ?
what am i gonna find in denmark ?
freedom .
but i don' t even know who i am .
what are you doing in my spot ?
you dind' t touch my magazines , did you ?
i' ve got to report all stowaways to the captain .
you' re in big trouble .
no , please don' t tell him .
i need to get to italy .
i' il give you this if you don' t turn me in !
pearl handle .
pretty nice .
it looks soviet .
throw in the compass and you' ve got a deal .
i can' t .
just the knife .
you know , i could take this and trun you in anyway .
but i' m an honest guy ... ... and i' d probably get in trouble for not turning you in sooner .
okay , you' ve got yourself a deal .
roberto , quit looking at your magazines and get up here !
keep your pants on , i' il be right up .
look , i can' t take a chance on anybody seeing you ... ... getting off the ship when we get into port .
so when we' re close to shore , i' il lower you overboard ... ... then you can swim to land .
don' t worry .
the current will help you drift to the coast .
you all set ?
have fun .
once you arrive in italy , travel north until you reach denmark .
why do they hate us so much , johannes ?
because it' s easy to hate people who don' t believe the same things you do .
did my parents not believe what the guards believe ?
is that why i' m in here ?
i didn' t know anything about your parents , but ... ... i would assume so .
i don' t remember them .
do you know what they were like ?
what they believed ?
where we were from ?
david ... ... i don' t know anything about you .
i wish i were dead .
don' t ever say that .
don' t even think it .
why not ?
there' s nothing good here .
what' s the point in even staying alive ?
if you' re alive , you can change things .
if you' re dead , you can' t .
do whatever you can to stay alive , no matter what .
go .
i know you' ve lived in this camp your entire life ... ... but there is a world outside it .
however , it' s a very dangerous world .
trust no one .
beautiful loaves , huh ?
sorry to scare you .
you want to get some bread ?
yes , please .
do you have any money ?
no .
i' m afraid my bread is not free .
where do you live ?
i' m in the circus .
in the circus ?
well , it' s not going to be here for another 2 weeks .
i think you are a little early .
where can i get some money for some bread , sir ?
just take a look at this kitchen .
it' s spotless .
and over there , that' s a traditional wood burning oven .
you know what abruzzi down the street bakes his bread with ?
gas .
and still people buy from him instead of me !
it' s unbelievable !
you know , before i can give you some bread ... ... you have to do something for me .
you have to smile .
why ?
why ?
because you' re about to have the best bread in italy .
that' s why .
oh , saint elizabeth ... ... the boy wants to know why he should smile .
i don' t think he know how to .
who' s that ?
that' s saint elizabeth .
she' s the patron saint of bakers .
she takes care of everyone who needs help .
but especially bakers .
here , see for yourself .
you keep that ... ... and maybe she' il help you out sometime , too .
i' il tell you what .
just stay here and i' il pick you out a nice , fresh loaf .
there is something about his face ... ... his eyes .
they are not the eyes of a normal boy .
come and see for yourselves .
my friends want to talk to you .
they just want to know who you are .
nothing to worry about .
we need to ask you a few questions .
i' m trying to help you .
you' ve got to believe me !
let me go !
travel north as far as you can .
good luck to you .
line up , right now !
line up !
line up over here right now !
right now !
who did it ?
which one of you is responsible ?
it was him .
i know it .
shoot him !
saint elizabeth ... ... my name is david ... ... and , well , the baker told me that you help people .
i want to get to denmark ... ... and i need help getting out of these woods .
i have to get to denmark ... ... and i can' t if i' m lost in here .
you must remain unseen .
and if you are seen , you must blend in with the people around you .
oh , saint elizabeth , the boy wants to know why he should smile .
i don' t think he knows how to .
saint elizabeth , remember how i said i wouldn' t ask you for anything else ?
go away !
please go away !
i didn' t mean to make you mad .
i promise , i was just trying to blend in .
gina !
be quiet !
what are you doing in my vineyard ?
were you eating my grapes ?
well , it' s a good thing you are here because i need help .
come along .
come on .
thank god gina caught you .
i' m desperate .
i need you to run this wine over to the bertelli' s party .
please be careful .
now , it' s 3 farms up the road and here' s 2 lira for your trouble .
what ?
i' m not giving you more .
do you know which way is north ?
what do i look like , a compass ?
i have no idea .
ask the bertellis .
now go .
go , go .
go !
gina , you bad dog !
come !
finally !
where have you been ?
you should have been here an hour ago .
good news , everyone !
the wine is here .
3 cheers for the delivery boy !
i don' t need any strange looking urchins at my party .
now scat !
what' s the matter with you ?
you have to go to the toilet or something ?
i' d like to buy some food , please .
well , congratulations .
you came to the right place .
i' d like one of those ... ... that , and one of those .
you got money ?
why don' t i just sell you the whole store for that ?
yeah , and i' il throw in my wife and kids , too .
get lost .
david !
mother ...
if you' d ever listen to me , this kind of thing wouldn' t happen .
look , just calm down .
we can' t be that far from a gas station .
i' m not going to go hiking off when we don' t know where we' re going .
i don' t even have the right shose on .
excuse me , young man ?
we need some help .
do you know if there' s a gas station around here ?
the kid' s not gonna speak english .
use your italian .
right .
my wine shop needs steak .
my wine shop needs steak .
no ?
my wine shop needs steak ?
i saw a place back there where they do that .
oh , you speak english .
great .
would you go get us some gas ?
i' il give you a tip if you do .
yes , sir .
sir ... ... l' d like to buy some things .
hey !
what are you doing on my property ?
think you' re gonna steal something ?
come on and fight me !
what' s this ?
something else you stole ?
give me that , that' s mine .
oh , yeah ?
i think it' s mine now .
go ahead and run , little piggy !
and don' t ever come back !
johannes ...
... i want to escape .
you said that if we weren' t dead , we could change things .
but how do we know they' re going to let us live ?
we don' t .
then we should leave while we still can .
they' d kill us if we tried .
they' re going to kill us anyway .
we should do whatever we can to stay alive .
that' s what you said .
you' re scared .
yes .
i am .
i don' t want to be scared anymore , johannes .
neither do i.
garlo !
help !
help !
help !
help !
don' t breathe !
i love you , david .
are you awake ?
i was watching you .
i wanted to make sure you were all right .
how long have i been asleep ?
since yesterday .
you must have been tired .
when the doctor came , you didn' t even waske up .
mother put you under the covers .
where' s my bundle ?
what bundle ?
nothing .
i was just confused .
you got burned ... ... but not very bad .
i got burned , too .
see ?
mine weren' t bad , either , but cecha and angelo are in trouble .
papa made them go the bed without supper ... ... because they weren' t supposed to be playing with fire .
what' s your name ?
david .
i' m maria .
thank you for saving me , david .
papa said i could have died .
you could have , too .
you' re very brave .
did i just smile at you ?
yes .
how come ?
i don' t know .
is it because you think i look funny ?
no .
then myabe you love me .
you' re awake .
maria , did you wake him up ?
i told you not to .
his name is david , mama , and he woke up on his own .
didn' t you ?
go downstairs and get ready for lunch .
david will be down in a minute .
yes , mama .
you saved my maria .
for this ... ... i owe you my life .
are you feeling okay ?
we have to get hold of your parents now that you' re awake .
they must be very worried .
we' ve been asking around , but no one knows where you' re from .
they won' t be worried about me .
i don' t live around here .
i' m on my way somewhere .
by yourself ?
where are you going ?
lunch is ready , senora .
thank you , julia .
well ... ... if you' re away from home ... ... then i want you to stay with us for a few days .
the doctor said you should rest and let your burns heal .
i have brought you some of carlo' s old clothes .
now , get dressed and come downstaris .
we' ve made a special lunch in your honor .
everyone' s dying to meet you .
i just wanted to tell you i was sorry .
i didn' t mean to beat you up yesterday .
look , i thought you were one of the boys who stole maria' s bike .
you probably would have done the same thing , right ?
no .
carlo , come down to lunch !
i called you 5 minutes ago !
coming .
please don' t tell my parents what happened yesterday , okay ?
i didn' t mean it , i swear .
all right ?
thanks .
come on .
david , my name is giovanni rescigno and i' m maria' s father .
it' s n honor to hv you here in our home .
david , come over here .
maria wants you to sit next to her .
maria , i know it' s your turn to say grace ... ... but it you don' t mind , i' d like to say it today .
dear god , we thank you ... ... for this wonderful food of which we' re about to partake ... ... and for all the bounty which you provide for us .
we especially want to thank you for sending us david ... ... whose bravery and selflessness ... ... has kept our dearest maria safe and well .
please bless david and our little family ... ... and guide us so that we may continue to perform your good works .
thank you so very much .
amen .
well , david , i don' t know about you , but i' m starving .
let' s eat .
it' s okay , david ?
is it nice to have a family ?
i like it ... ... but i don' t know anyone who doesn' t have one .
don' t you have a family ?
i don' t know , but i' d like one .
we can be your family .
you can be an honorary memeber .
do you like your brother carlo ?
yes , but he makes fun of me a lot .
he calls me " crybaby " , but i don' t cry as much as i used to .
don' t you like him ?
there' s a lot of people i don' t like .
why not ?
becuase the world is filled with terrible people , maria ... ... and they all do terrible , evil things .
i' ve seen them .
you don' t think that we are terrible people , do you ?
no , not at all .
not even carlo ?
let' s go inside .
i want to show you something .
my papa has lots of poetry books .
he reads to me from them .
shakespeare is my favorite .
do you like shakespeare' s sonnets ?
i' ve never heard them .
you don' t know anything good ... ... do you ?
what' s that ?
that' s the earth .
i' ve never seen a map like this before .
do you know how to read it ?
uh huh .
that' s italy ... ... and there is russia ... ... and there' s america .
where' s denmark ?
that' s up here .
switzerland and germany are between them and us .
have you ever been to denmark ?
no .
have you ?
i' m on my way there now .
you are ?
why are you going to denmark , david ?
you know you' re not supposed to be in here without papa' s permission .
i' m sorry .
i just wanted to read david some poetry .
all right .
why don' t you go and cut some flowers for the dinner table ?
can david help me ?
no , let david stay here .
papa and i want to talk to him .
how' s your hand feeling ?
fine .
david , gianni and i just want to make sure everything' s okay with you .
this morning you said you' re on your way somewhere .
where are you going ?
i' m going to ... ... to meet up with the circus .
the circus ?
yes , i' m in the circus .
and what do you do in the circus ?
lots of thing .
and that' s where your parents are ?
yes .
why are your parents letting you travel by yourself ?
it' s okay .
they don' t mind .
david , are you lying to us ?
no .
are you lying to us ?
in this house , lies are not permitted .
no , i swear !
okay .
it' s okay , david .
it' s okay .
we just wanted to make sure everything was all right .
you don' t have to worry .
my goodness , we wouldn' t hurt you .
we' re sorry to ask you so many questions .
why don' t you go and get ready for dinner ?
you stole it .
when no one was around , i went into the man' s office . do you know what they' il do to you if they find it ?
it was in his desk .
promise me you' il never take something that' s not yours again .
you must promise me that .
who did it ?
which one of you is responsible ?
it was him .
i know it .
shoot him .
they must be taught a lesson .
no , it was him .
take care of her , saint elizabeth .
i don' t deserve to have you look after me anymore .
i don' t deserve anything good .
please tell maria that i' m sorry .
and if you talk to johannes ... ... tell him i' m sorry , too .
workers of the world ...
unite !
workers of the world ...
unite !
that was a big mistake , boy .
it wasn' t me !
i didn' t throw it !
let me out !
where do you think you' re going ?
come on !
you better stay right there , boy !
come back !
come back here !
where do you think you' re going ?
come here !
i' il find you , boy !
hey , my firiend !
i see you made it to shore .
well done .
roberto ?
why aren' t you on the ship ?
i quit .
it was too boring .
besides , they caught me stealing a crate of tomatoes .
you need a ride ?
hop in .
where are you going to ?
denmark .
denmark ?
that' s a long way .
i' m only going to milan .
that' s okay .
i was in denmark a few summers ago .
it' s pretty nice .
lots of good looking girls .
good bye , my friend , and good luck .
say hello to denmark for me .
hello .
i thought there was somebody there .
i always know when someone' s looking at me behind my back . some sort of psychic energy , don' t you think ?
come over and take a look at this , will you ?
i' ve been trying all morning ... ... to capture the essence of this beautiful place .
usually when i come up here , it inspires me ... ... but today , nothing seems to be working for me .
what do you think ?
it' s very pretty .
is it ?
it all seems a bit lifeless to me .
you' ve got a very interesting face .
would you mind if i painted it ?
what color do you want to paint my face ?
i like that .
i think you' il make quite a challenging subject .
that is , if you don' t mind sitting for a bit .
i' m sophie , by the way .
what' s your name ?
david .
david ?
that' s too perfect .
michelangelo had his david , so you' ve got to let me have mine .
you' re very good at sitting still , david .
most adults i paint can' t sit still for a minute without fidgeting .
i always tell them the more they move ... ... the worse they look in the picture .
but that doesn' t mean you can' t move your mouth .
talking won' t ruin the painting .
i' m not that bad .
i don' t really have anything to say .
well , then you don' t have to say anything .
there are an awful lot of people in this world ... ... who have nothing to say , but seem to spend all their time talking .
you' re right to conserve your words .
it means you' il be a man with great power .
i don' t want to be a man of great power .
then you don' t have to be .
just be happy that you' re the kind of person who could be if he wanted to .
i' m having such trouble ... ... with your eyes .
i' ve never had to use so much black paint before .
such serious eyes .
such a serious face .
well , just one or two more finishing touches and then we' re done .
i wish my house was a bit closer .
i' d love to invite you to lunch ... ... to repay you for your kindness .
where do you live ?
just over the border , in switzerland .
david ... ... are you quite sure your parents won' t mind you coming this far ?
it' s okay .
they don' t mind .
they don' t live around here anyway .
i see .
what' s that ?
that' s just my sketchbook .
all my drawings are in there .
can i look at them , please ?
you can if you want to .
but i warn you , they' re not very good .
i went to a few art classes when i was younger ... ... but i never really kept up with it .
i only studied painting again a year ago .
just for my own amusement .
who' s that ?
that' s just a boy i knew a long time ago .
i told you they were not very good .
i have to get out .
what ?
is something the matter ?
you can do whatever you want .
i thought you want to see switzerland .
i do .
well , now ... ... they' re going to ask us for identification .
do you have any ?
no .
well , it doesn' t really matter .
this is an easy border .
it shouldn' t be a problem .
okay ?
okay .
good day , ma' am .
good morning .
your papers , please .
yes , of course .
and for the boy also .
this is my grandson , officer ... ... and we left the house in such a hurry this morning ... ... he forgot to bring his identification .
i don' t know .
our orders are to check everyone' s papers , even children .
couldn' t you relax the rules for a bit ?
all he wants to do is to come into your country ... ... overthrow the government and then rush right out again .
all right , mrs. anderson .
have a nice day .
and young man ... ... see if you can get us pay raises while you' re taking over our country .
there , you see ?
no problem .
now we can go and have some lunch .
i' m afraid there' s no escaping my artwork .
but it' s less expensive than buying real paintings .
they look like real paintings to me .
but wait a minute .
we have to add my latest work to the gallery wall .
hold it a minute , would you ?
thank you .
is that what i look like ?
to me , yes .
it' s my impression of you .
that' s why it' s called impressionistic painting .
so ... ... what do you see when you look at it ?
me ?
well , yes .
that' s not quite what i meant . you have to look at paintings differently ... ... from the way you look at other things .
more closely ... ... to see what it says to you .
well ... ... when i look at the boy in that painting ... ... i see a very intelligent , very serious person ... ... and a good person .
but ... ... ther' s something about the eyes ... ... and the face that seems lost and sad .
but that' s as far as i can see ... ... because he doesn' t want to let the world see any further .
do you really see all that ?
yes .
yes , i do .
oops , there' s our tea .
i hope there' s enough food for you .
i' m a very light eater ... ... but i know boys can pack away quite a lot .
i' m fine .
it' s very nice .
thank you .
good .
hello , annette .
i thought you might smell our food .
or have you come to say hello to our guest ?
do you like cats ?
i don' t know .
i guess so .
well , if you knew annette , you would .
she' s very sweet and also very funny , aren' t you , pussycat ?
what' s that ?
what ?
this ?
it' s a locket .
i' ve had it for ages .
it belonged to my mother .
and look , i' il show you .
my father had it inscribed on the back .
he gave it to her on their wedding day .
is that the same boy that you drew ?
yes .
that' s my son , peter .
or he was my son .
he died not long after that picture was taken .
what happened ?
pneumonia .
he' d always been a frail child ... ... but he was a very sweet , very loving boy .
did he live here with you ?
no , we all lived in zurich then .
but ... ... some other things happened ... ... after peter died and ... ... and i decided to move up here .
and besides , who wouldn' t want to live up here ?
it' s such a beautiful place , don' t you think ?
we think so , don' t we , pussycat ?
would you like to hold her ?
she won' t bite .
okay .
she' s so soft .
and she' s vibrating .
she' s purring , david .
have you never stroked a cat before ?
no .
where do you live , david ?
nowhere .
i' m in the circus .
in the circus ?
oh , my goodness .
that must be very interesting .
yes , it is .
it' s very interesting .
if you need a place to stay the night ...
... you' re very welcome to stay here .
no .
i can' t .
i have to go .
i can' t stay anywhere anymore .
david , if there' s something troubling you ... ... l' d very much like to help you if i can .
please ...
... don' t turn me in .
turn you in to whom ?
to them .
to him , to anyone .
i wouldn' t dream of turning you in to anybody for any reason .
you' re quite safe here , david .
you' re safe .
from the guards ?
from everybody .
i want to tell you everything , sophie , but i can' t .
i just can' t .
you don' t have to tell me anything .
i just want you to know that you' re safe here ... ... and that everything will be all right .
sleep well , david .
everything' s all right .
good morning , david .
i hope i didn' t wake you .
i have to go to the village .
i promised to take some food to a friend of mine who' s sick .
you can come along if you want to .
why do people do such terrible things ?
like what ?
like beat people and kill them , and make them prisoners .
most people don' t do that .
my friend johannes always used to tell me ... ... " trust no one .
life wouldn' t be worth living if you did that , david .
you can be cautious , but you have to let people in .
how do you know if they' re bad or not ?
david , most people are good .
they have families and friends ... ... and they just want to live their lives as happily as they can .
there will always be bad people in this world ... ... and you' il usually know them when you meet them ... ... but sometimes you won' t .
but you can' t let that stop you from ... ... living your life fully and freely ... ... and making friends ... ... and seeing the goodness in people .
because if you don' t do that , you' il never find any happiness .
now this is my friend' s house .
but you don' t need to come in , david .
why don' t you go exploring ?
look around some of the shops .
i' il meet you in the bookshop in a little while , okay ?
they' re nice people , david .
you don' t have to worry about anything .
okay ?
hello .
and hello to you .
you must do everything i just told you if you want to escape .
they' re moving me to another camp tomorrow ... ... and i can no longer watch over you .
this is the only way you' il ever be safe .
do you understand ?
i know you' ve lived in this camp your entire life ... ... but there is a world outside it .
however , it' s a very dangerous world .
trust no one .
and ... ... i' m sorry about your friend johannes .
i' ve seen this bood before .
what is it ?
that' s a wonderful book , david .
it was written by a woman who lost her husband and her son ... ... in bulgaria after the war .
the husband came from england .
when he went to bulgaria to rouse people against the communists ... ... he took her and the boy with him .
but they were all arrested , and the man and the boy were killed .
but one of the guards had known the woman ... ... since they were children and he' d always been in love with her .
so he arranged for forged papers and helped her to escape .
is the woman still alive ?
yes .
she lives in denmark .
i am david .
i know , david .
i know .
