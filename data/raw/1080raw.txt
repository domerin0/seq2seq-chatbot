del griffith .
american light and fixture ...
director of sales , shower curtain ring division .
i sell shower curtain rings .
best in the world .
and you are ?
uh , neal page .
neal page .
pleased to meet you , neal page .
so what do you do for a living , neal page ?
marketing .
marketing ?
super .
super .
fabulous .
isn' t that nice ?
i don' t want to be rude , but ...
i' m not much of a conversationalist .
i' d like to finish this article .
a friend wrote it , so ...
don' t let me stop you .
last thing i want to be is an annoying blabbermouth .
nothing grinds my gears worse than some chowderhead who can' t keep his trap shut .
catch me running off at the mouth , give me a poke .
ohh !
ohh , that feels good .
oh , god , i' m telling you .
my dogs are barking today .
whew !
ohh !
that feels better .
six bucks and my right nut says we' re not landing in chicago .
hello .
hi .
where are you ?
i' m in wichita .
wichita , kansas ?
are you all right ?
what happened ?
we couldn' t land in chicago .
i don' t understand what wichita has to do with a snowstorm in chicago ?
what' s going on , neal ?
we took off from new york , they closed chicago , we landed here .
neal .
trouble on the home front ?
i really don' t think that' s any of your concern .
the finest line a man will walk is between success at work and success at home .
i got a motto ...
like your work , love your wife .
well , i' il remember that .
what' s the flight situation ?
simple .
no way we' il get out of here tonight .
we' d have more luck playing pickup sticks with our butt cheeks .
we' il find out soon enough .
by the time the airline cancels this flight , which they will eventually , you' d have a better chance finding a three legged ballerina than a hotel room .
i could be stuck here ?
i' m saying you are stuck here .
ladies and gentlemen , may i have your attention , please .
i' m sorry to announce that we' re canceling flight 909 due to severe weather in chicago .
hi , i was wondering if you had any rooms available for tonight ?
anything .
anything will do .
i' m sorry .
is there another motel ...
neal .
hi .
well ?
welcome to wichita .
did you book a room yet ?
i , uh , couldn' t get in anywhere .
when we arrived , you called home .
i called the braidwood inn .
i missed that one .
i got an idea .
i know the manager .
if you pick up the cab fare ,
i' il make sure you get a room .
umm ...
yeah .
yeah , sure .
great .
all right .
grab an end of this thing , will you ?
thanks a lot .
is this your trunk ?
yeah .
you should try lugging this thing around new york city .
# well , it takes you up #
# and it beats you down , yeah #
# it plays around #
# and it spends your money ... ##
where the hell is the motel ?
doobie , is it much farther ?
not much .
why didn' t you take the interstate ?
your friend has never been here , so i figured he' d like to look around .
there' s nothing on the interstate .
it' s the middle of the night .
i know , but he' s proud of his town .
that' s a rare thing these days .
take care of the luggage , will you , doobie ?
ok , del .
get off of me .
stick with me .
evening , gus .
del griffith , how the hell are you ?
still a million bucks shy of being a millionaire .
gus , meet an old friend .
neal page , gus mooney .
glad to meet you , nick .
i told my friend you' d give him a room tonight .
do you have a major credit card ?
do you still honor those discount credit cards ?
i' il have to charge you for a double , but with the discount , it' il come out even .
we' re a pretty good team .
we were on our way to chicago , and the storm brought us here .
i know .
i must have half your flight here .
well , i guess you' re all fixed , so , uh , there you are .
last room in the complex .
you mean sh share ?
hey , easy on that .
ok .
hell of a cab ride , wasn' t it ?
yeah , you don' t see cabs like that too often .
want to take a shower ?
no !
i meant , did you want to go first ?
you you thought ...
i wouldn' t ...
what do you think i am ?
gee , that' s funny .
ah .
ah .
oh , come ... come on .
ah !
ouch , ouch , ouch !
to wear a pompadour ...
excuse me .
i' d switch pillows with you , but i' m allergic to sponge .
i' d be sneezing all night with that thing .
that' s why i carry my own pillow .
it' s hypoallergenic .
i had no idea those beer cans would blow like that .
you left them on a vibrating bed .
what did you think would happen ?
it just didn' t occur to me .
it didn' t occur to you , so i have to sleep in a puddle of beer .
you want to switch ?
i just want to sleep .
me , too .
i am bushed .
good night .
good night .
i' il have to burn the sheets !
what if the shoe was on the other foot ?
i' d go barefoot !
traffic is resuming at o' hare field , and flights will be moving shortly .
sorry .
goddamn !
what , what ?
that' s it !
without clearing my sinuses , i' il snore all night .
if your kid spills his milk , do you slap him ?
what what what is that supposed to mean ?
you' re not a very tolerant person .
you' ve bugged me since new york , starting with stealing my cab .
god , you' re a tight ass .
how would you like a mouthful of teeth ?
oh , and hostile , too .
nice personality combination ... hostile and intolerant .
that' s borderline criminal .
screw you .
you spilled beer all over the bed , you mess up the bathroom ...
who let you stay ?
i even let you pay , so you wouldn' t feel like an intruder .
an intruder ?
right .
you ruined a nice trip .
who talked my ear off on the plane ?
who was that ?
i' m curious .
who told you to book a room ?
i did .
you' re an ungrateful jackass .
sleep in the lobby .
i hope you wake up so stiff you can' t even move .
you got a free cab , a free room , and someone who will listen to your boring stories .
didn' t you notice on the plane when you started talking ,
i started reading the vomit bag ?
didn' t that give you some clue that this guy' s not enjoying it ?
everything' s not an anecdote .
you have to discriminate .
you choose things that are funny or mildly amusing or interesting .
you' re a miracle .
your stories have none of that .
they' re not even amusing accidentally .
honey , meet del griffith .
he' s got some amusing anecdotes .
here' s a gun so you can blow your brains out .
you' il thank me for it .
i could tolerate any insurance seminar .
for days , i could listen to them go on and on .
they' d say , " how can you stand it ?
and i' d say , " ' cause i' ve been with del griffith .
i can take anything .
you know what they' d say ?
i know what you mean .
the shower curtain ring guy .
it' s like going on a date with a chatty cathy doll .
there should be a string on your chest that i pull out .
except i wouldn' t pull it out , you would .
ah !
ah !
ah !
ah !
by the way , when you' re telling these little stories , here' s a good idea .
have a point .
it makes it more interesting for the listener .
you want to hurt me ?
go ahead if it makes you feel better .
i' m an easy target .
yeah , you' re right .
i talk too much .
i also listen too much .
i could be a cold hearted cynic like you , but i don' t like to hurt people' s feelings .
well , you think what you want about me .
i' m not changing .
i like ...
i like me .
my wife likes me .
my customers like me .
' cause i' m the real article .
what you see is what you get .
# i' m back in baby' s arms #
# how i miss those lovin ' arms #
# i am back where i belong #
# back in baby' s arms #
# don' t know why we quarreled #
# we never did before #
# since we found out how it hurts ... ##
del .
hmm ?
yeah .
why did you kiss my ear ?
why are you holding my hand ?
where' s your other hand ?
between two pillows .
those aren' t pillows !
aah !
oh , no !
ooh !
oh !
oh !
oh !
see that bears ' game last week ?
hell of a game .
they' re going all the way .
ohh , yeow .
neal , take my socks out of the sink if you' re going to brush your teeth .
where are you ?
i' m in wichita .
i' m at a motel with this guy i met on the plane .
you shared a motel room with a stranger ?
are you crazy ?
i' m getting there .
did you call the airline ?
i have a good chance of getting on standby .
if they told you wolverines make good house pets , would you believe them ?
i' m not spending thanksgiving in wichita .
i' il get home .
mmm .
not by airplane .
they got 18 hours of air traffic backed up .
we' re going to be having our turkey roll right here .
if we wait for the flight .
how else can we get home ?
burt dingman .
he works for the railroad .
i sold them all their shower curtain rings .
he owes me a favor .
i' il get that .
i paid for everything else .
why break precedent ?
you' re making me feel like a freeloader .
get me on the train , we' re square .
you got it .
that' s the easy part .
what ?
you know goddamn well what .
i' m sorry .
i don' t .
i had over $ 700 in here .
i' m a lot of things , but i' m not a thief .
you went into my stuff last night , right ?
i didn' t take your money .
i had over $ 700 .
you went into my wallet for pizza .
just maybe when you went into ...
count it !
like you' d keep it in there .
there' s $263 in there .
if there' s more , you can call me a thief .
count it !
263 , right ?
empty .
what ?
we were robbed .
do you think so ?
i' ve been thinking .
what we' re dealing with is a smalltime crook .
he didn' t take the credit cards , so we charge our way home .
i' ve got a visa and a gasoline card .
oh , and a neiman marcus card in case we want to buy a gift .
what have you got ?
chalmer' s big and tall men' s shoppe , a seven outlet chain in the pacific northwest .
unfortunately , it does us no good here .
get me to the train station , and i' il take care of everything else .
gus ' son is picking us up .
this is not him , is it ?
gee , i hope not .

she didn' t scream or nothing .
isn' t that something ?
you' re a real trooper .
we' ve got it already .
it' s done .
you know , stubbville' s a little further than wichita .
how much further ?
30 miles .
maybe 40 .
no more than 45 though , depending on how he goes .
it could be anywhere up to 70 miles .
woof !
woof !
give me the glove .
ow !

little part .
ooh !
give him the goddamn glove !
are we there yet ?
no , a little way to go yet .

the trucks will take you into jefferson city .
you' re in a lousy mood , huh ?
to say the least .
you ever travel by bus before ?
hmm .
your mood' s probably not going to improve much .
# well , i got you in my sights #

i' m sorry .

they don' t come back again .
i' ve been spending too much time away from home .
i haven' t been home in years .

i called a friend of mine at eastern airlines .

i know .
i called all the airlines .
well , at least we' re sitting on over 100 beans from my brilliant idea .
you' re a terrific salesman .

i' ve been thinking that when we put our heads together , we really ... we' ve really gotten nowhere .
and , uh ... you know , i think i' m holding you up .
don' t say that about yourself .
that' s not true , neal .
i think we' il get where we' re going a lot faster if , uh ... we were alone .
ok ?
ok .
i see .
i think i' il just take care of this and get going .
i appreciate that .
it' s just harder for two people to travel .

then give me a fucking automobile .
a fucking datsun , a fucking toyota , a fucking buick .
four fucking wheels and a seat .
i don' t care for the way you' re speaking .
i don' t care for the way your company left me in fucking nowhere with keys to a fucking car that isn' t fucking there .
i didn' t care to fucking walk down a fucking highway and across a fucking runway to get back here to have you smile at my fucking face .
i want a fucking car right fucking now .

i threw it away .
oh , boy .

you insensitive asshole .
there' s an injured man down on the street .

my pleasure .
ohh ...
i had a feeling that when we parted ways , somehow , someday , our paths would cross again .
are you all right ?
i' ve never seen anyone get lifted by his testicles before .
lucky thing for you that cop came when he did .
otherwise , you' d be lifting your schnutz to tie your shoes .
i' m sorry .
that' s terrible .
you know , i' m glad i didn' t kill you .
i' d be glad if you had .
oh , you don' t mean that .
remember what i said ?
go with the flow .
how can i when the rental car agency
leaves me keys to a car that isn' t there , then i find out they don' t have any more cars ?
i got a car , no sweat at all .
well , del , you' re a charmed man .
nope .
oh , i know .
you just go with the flow .
like a twig on the shoulders of a mighty stream .

would you please stop doing that with the seat ?
once you screw with these , you never get comfortable .
quit screwing with it .
i' m getting comfortable .
do you have a bad back ?

you' re going to break it .
ahh .

ah , lovely .
lovely , lovely .
oh , damn it .

i can' t reach my feet to get my shoes off .
that' s fine .

i can' t relax that way .
i don' t care to breathe your foot odor .
it must be swell being so perfect and odor free .
things about you bother me , but i' m decent enough not to bring them up .
what about me bothers you ?
there' s lots of things .
name one .
you want me to name one ?
fine , um ... you play with your balls a lot .
i do not play with my balls .
larry bird doesn' t handle the ball as much as you do .

i don' t want to argue .
let' s not fight .

# blue moon of kentucky , keep on shining #

a cop .
watch it !
how fast are you going ?
i can' t tell .
the speedometer' s melted .
pull over .
top of the morning , officer .
hi .
is there something i can help you with ?
what the hell you driving ?
we had a small fire last night .
you have any idea how fast you were going ?
our speedometer' s melted .
it' s hard to say with any degree of accuracy how fast we were going .
78 miles an hour .
78 , huh ?
well , yeah .
i can buy that .
sure .
you' d know better than us , especially since our speedometer' s melted .
you feel this vehicle is safe for highway travel ?
yes , i do .
it' s not pretty , but it will get you where you want to go .
you got no outside mirror .
it' s lost .
you have no functioning gauges .
no , not a one .
however , the radio still works .
funny as that may seem , the radio' s the only thing that' s really working good .
don' t ask me how .
i can' t let you go .
can' t what ?
it' s not fit for the road .
the vehicle will be impounded until it' s made safe for travel .
ok , officer , i admit i broke the law , and for that i' m really sorry .
you got me there , and i won' t argue one iota , i swear .
however , um ... if you impound our car ,
i' il be unable to get my friend home for his thanksgiving dinner .
well , our ship has come in .
it' s free and it' s nonstop .
i said i' d get you home .
just so the heater' s working .
the driver' s a little freaky about people riding in his cab .
we can' t sit there .
then where are we supposed to ride ?
beats walking , huh ?
you know , you' re going to be in chicago in less than three hours , around there , if we don' t hit traffic , and i don' t think we should since it' s thanksgiving .
we' re moving now .
you believe this ?
it' s been a hell of a trip .
sure has .
but , uh , after all is said and done , you did get me home .
next time , let' s go first class , all right ?
god , i hope there isn' t a next time .
i know .
this you ?
yeah .
it' s been great meeting you .
i' m sorry if i caused you any trouble .
you got me home , and , uh ... a little late .
a couple days .
but , uh ...
i' m a little wiser , too .
me , too .
happy holidays .
same to you .
happy thanksgiving , neal .
give my love to the family .
maybe i' il meet them someday .
say hello to marie for me .
yeah .
so ...
ok .
and you have a happy thanksgiving .
hey , you know it .

i haven' t been home in years .
i haven' t been home in years .
del , what are you doing here ?
