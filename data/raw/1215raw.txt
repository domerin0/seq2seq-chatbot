good morning , bastian .
i had another dream , dad , about mom .
i understand , son .
but we have to get on with things , right ?
bastian , we each have responsibilities .
we can' t let mom' s death ... ... be an excuse for not getting the job done , right ?
yes .
son , it' s time you and i had a talk .
i got a call from your math teacher yesterday .
she says that you were ... ... drawing horses in your math book .
unicorns .
they were unicorns .
what ?
nothing .
she also says you don' t do your homework on time .
i' m very disappointed you didn' t even try out for the swimming team .
as to those riding lessons you wanted ....
you say you love horses but you' re afraid to get on a real one .
you' re old enough to get your head down out of the clouds and ... ... and keep both feet on the ground .
okay .
stop daydreaming .
start facing your problems .
okay ?
there , i think we' ve had a nice talk .
we should have more .
have a good day , son .
don' t be late for school again .
but , yesterday i wasn' t .
hey , it' s the weirdo .
weirdo , you got any cash for us today ?
let' s get him !
you can' t get away .
you' re dead , chicken !
we' il get you !
where' s your money ?
i don' t have any !
no money ?
mamma' s boy is holding out .
if you ain' t got money , you go in the garbage .
maybe the chicken can lay an egg in there .
who said you could get out of the garbage ?
get back in there .
not again .
not again !
where are you going , wimp ?
he went that way .
which way ?
get out of here !
i don' t like kids .
are you still here ?
didn' t you hear me ?
you' re hiding , aren' t you ?
the video arcade is down the street .
here we just sell small rectangular objects .
they' re called books .
they require effort and make no beeps .
on your way .
i know books .
i have 186 of them at home .
comic books .
no , i' ve read treasure lsland ... ...
the last of the mohicans , wizard of oz ... ... lord of the rings , 20, 000 leagues under the sea , tarzan .
who are you running away from ?
some kids from school .
why ?
they threw me in the garbage .
why not punch them in the nose ?
i don' t know .
what' s that book about ?
oh , this is something special .
well , what is it ?
look .
your books are safe .
while you' re reading them ... ... you get to become tarzan or robinson crusoe .
but that' s what i like about them .
but afterwards you get to be a little boy again .
what do you mean ?
listen .
have you ever been ... ... captain nemo ... ... trapped inside your submarine while the giant squid is attacking you ?
yes .
weren' t you afraid you couldn' t escape ?
but it' s only a story .
that' s what i' m talking about .
the ones you read ... ... are safe .
and that one isn' t ?
don' t worry about it .
but you just said it was
forget about it .
this book is not for you .
koreander' s .
what can i do for you ?
they run maybe 300 , 370 ....
it will take me a couple of a weeks .
math test .
oh , no !
" it was midnight in the howling forest .
" the wind whistled through the tops of the ancient trees .
" suddenly , something enormous ... " ... crashed and rumbled through the eerie woods .
what' s that ?
excuse me ... ... but would it be all right if i joined you this evening ?
you see , i' ve been traveling all day .
now i see why you picked this camp .
a delicious looking limestone rock !
nice bouquet .
must be a real vintage year .
yes , you' re right .
those delicious rocks are the reason we' ve camped here .
is he a nutcase ?
no , he' s a rock biter .
a rock biter !
sorry .
poor baby .
pardon me .
that was limestone , with a dash of quartz .
very tasty .
where i come from in the north , we us to have exquisite gourmet rocks .
only now ... ... now ... ... they' re all gone .
i know how it happened .
i swear it wasn' t me .
i think i know what it was .
tell us more .
near my home , there used to be a beautiful lake ... ... but then ... ... then it was gone .
did the lake dry up ?
no .
it just wasn' t there anymore .
nothing was there anymore .
not even a dried up lake .
a hole ?
a hole would be something .
no , it was nothing .
and it got bigger and bigger .
first , there was no lake anymore .
and then , finally , no rocks .
if he keeps stuffing his face like that , soon there won' t be any rocks here either .
night hob , this could be serious !
rock biter ... ... what you told us is also happening where i live in the west .
a strange sort of nothing is destroying everything .
yes .
we night hobs live in the south and it' s there , too .
so , it' s not just in our part of fantasia ?
maybe , it' s already everywhere .
maybe our whole land is in danger .
what can we do ?
my people are sending me to the ivory tower , to the empress , for help .
we are on the same
we are on the same mission .
after all , if the empress can' t save us ... ... who could ?
then why are we all just sitting here ... ... instead of taking off for the ivory tower ?
what are we waiting for ?
yes .
let' s go now .
wake up !
come on , old girl .
we can' t just hang around here .
wake up !
ready for take off .
oh , stupid bat !
we can' t wait for a snail .
can i carry you ?
don' t worry .
it' s a racing snail .
but we can' t even wait for a racing snail .
it really is a racing snail .
nobody gives a hoot about me and my stupid bat .
maybe i' il take a few of these yummy gourmet rocks , for the road ....
the nothing !
look !
there it is !
the heart of fantasia !
i never knew it was that beautiful .
stay awake !
i told you to stay awake .
the home of the empress .
she' s our only hope .
friends , i know why you are all here .
the nothing ... ... is destroying our world .
i also know that you ... ... have come to beseech ... ... the empress for help .
but i have terrible news .
the empress herself has become deathly ill .
there seems to be a mysterious link between her illness and the nothing .
she' s dying .
so , she cannot save us .
but there just might be one chance .
the plains people who hunt the purple buffalo ... ... have among them a great warrior .
he alone has a chance to fight the nothing and save us .
he is our only hope .
his name is atreyu .
atreyu .
" the empress had already sent for the great warrior .
" when he finally appeared on the terrace of the ivory tower ... " ... he carried with him the hopes of all fantasia .
a little boy !
i' m sorry , but this is not the time nor place for children .
you must leave .
if you don' t want me here , you shouldn' t have sent for me .
is he a nutcase ?
it was not you we sent for .
we wanted atreyu .
i am atreyu .
not atreyu the child .
atreyu the warrior .
i am the only atreyu of the plains people .
but i' il be happy to go back to hunting the purple buffalo .
wait !
come back , please .
if you really are the atreyu we sent for ... ... you would be willing to go on a quest ?
yes , of course .
what kind of a quest ?
to find a cure for the empress ... ... and to save our world .
you must go alone .
you must leave all your weapons behind .
it will be very dangerous .
any chance of success ?
i do not know .
but if you fail ... ... the empress will surely die ... ... and our whole world will be destroyed .
when do i begin ?
now .
and you must hurry , atreyu .
the nothing grows stronger every day .
take this .
the auryn !
he who wears the auryn speaks for the empress .
it will guide and protect you .
wake up .
farewell , atreyu .
take care .
" a t the same time ... " ... elsewhere in fantasia , a creature of darkness ... " ... also began his quest .
" they had been traveling aimlessly for almost a week ... " ... but they couldnot find a cure for the empress .
" neither atreyu nor his horse , artax , had the vaguest suspicion ... " ... that the creature of darkness , the gmork ... " ... was already tracking them down .
what is it , artax ?
is it time to go already ?
i know what you want .
it' s time to eat .
good idea .
no , it' s a great idea !
no , not too much .
we still have a long way to go .
" a treyu and artax had searched the silver mountains ... " ... the desert of shattered hopes and the crystal towers ... " ... without success .
" and so , there was only one chance left .
" to find morla , the ancient one ... " ... the wisest being in fantasia ... " ... whose home was the shell mountain ... " ... somewhere in the deadly swamps of sadness .
come on , boy .
come on .
that' s it .
it' s okay .
" everyone knew that whoever let the sadness overtake him ... " ... would sink into the swamp .
you' re doing fine , artax .
come on , artax .
what' s the matter ?
what' s wrong ?
come on , boy .
what' s the matter ?
i understand .
it' s too difficult for you .
artax , you' re sinking !
come on !
turn around !
you have to !
now !
fight against the sadness .
artax , please .
don' t let the sadness of the swamps get to you .
you have to try .
you have to care .
for me .
you' re my friend .
i love you .
artax , stupid horse .
you got to move or you' il die .
move .
please .
i won' t give up .
don' t quit .
artax !
the shell mountain .
morla , the ancient one .
morla .
but that' s impossible .
they couldn' t have heard me .
are you morla , the ancient one ?
not that it matters , but yes .
please help me .
do you recognize this ?
well ... ... we haven' t seen ... ... the auryn in a long time .
we ?
is there someone else here , too ?
we haven' t spoken to anyone else ... ... for thousands of years .
so we started talking ... ... to ourselves .
morla , i bring terrible news .
did you know the empress is ill ?
not that it matters , but yes .
actually , we don' t care .
if i don' t save her , she' il die .
there' s a terrible nothing sweeping over the land .
don' t you care ?
we don' t even care ... ... whether or not we care .
do you have a cold ?
no .
we' re allergic ... ... to youth .
you know how to help the empress , don' t you ?
not that it matters ... ... but yes .
if you don' t tell me and the nothing keeps coming , you' il die too .
both of you .
die ?
that , at least , would be something .
please help me .
you said you knew the answer .
we' re tired of sneezing .
go away !
nothing matters .
that' s not true .
if it didn' t matter to you , you could tell me .
clever boy .
tell me , please .
we don' t know .
but you can ask ... ... the southern oracle .
how can i get there ?
you can' t .
it' s 10, 000 miles away .
but that' s so far .
that' s right .
forget it .
give up .
no .
atreyu wouldn' t quit now .
oh , boy !
" after days and nights of unconsciousness ... " ... atreyu slowly opened his eyes ... " ... and found himself in strange surroundings .
" he was clean and his wounds were dressed .
leaving so soon ?
i was just going to ....
i have to ....
i was trying to  sneak away ?
yes .
i mean , no .
i like children .
for breakfast ?
never .
i' m a luck dragon .
my name is falkor .
and my name is  atreyu .
and you' re on a quest .
how did you know that ?
you were unconscious .
you talked in your sleep .
could you get around ... ... and scratch behind my right ear ?
i can never quite reach it .
here ?
that' s so good .
thank you .
so , little fellow , you' re on your way to the southern oracle ?
yes .
but it' s hopeless .
it' s too far away .
i wouldn' t necessarily say that .
you know how to get there ?
sure .
it' s right around the corner .
how did all this happen ?
with luck .
you brought me the entire 10, 000 miles ?
no .
only 9, 891 ... ... as the dragon flies .
you' re amazing .
having a luck dragon with you is the only way to go on a quest .
things will work out fine .
never give up and good luck will find you .
it' s good to have a friend again .
you have more than one .
look .
get out of my light , wench .
you' re disturbing my scientific work .
you and your scientific work .
what the boy needs now is one of my potions .
the boy will need my scientific advice much more .
but not until he' s well .
get back to your own corner , engy .
i' m always finding you in my place .
he' s well .
now it' s my turn with him .
no , you don' t !
i' il decide when he' s well .
it' s your turn when i say it is .
well , little man , still in pain ?
it' s all right .
i like that .
the patient telling the doctor it' s all right .
it has to hurt if it' s to heal .
drink that .
good ?
that' s my bat wing broth .
there' s eye of newt in there , tree mold , old lizard brains ... ... scales from a rancid sea serpent .
just where did you and your dragon come from ?
what are you on to ?
anything of interest to the scientific community ?
my name is atreyu .
i came to find the southern oracle .
here we go again .
you' ve come to the right place , my boy .
i am somewhat of an expert on the southern oracle .
it is my scientific specialty .
it is my scientific specialty .
why don' t you sit down and be quiet for once ?
you keep quiet , wench .
it' s my turn .
my name is engywook .
she' s urgl .
ever heard of me ?
i don' t think so .
you don' t move in scientific circles .
i am the expert on the southern oracle .
you' ve come to the right place .
there' s no fool like an old fool .
wait !
stay here .
the observatory .
to the winch , wench .
come on , lazybones !
can' t you go any faster ?
i' ve been studying the southern oracle for years .
a century of studying the southern oracle , by professor engywook .
the early years .
have you ever been to the southern oracle ?
what do you think ?
i work scientifically .
look .
is that the southern oracle ?
no .
it' s the first of the two gates you must pass through ... ... before you reach the southern oracle ... ... and get me the final information for my book .
of course , most people ... ... never get that far .
why ?
the sphinxes ' eyes ... ... stay closed until someone who does not feel his own worth ... ... tries to pass by .
here comes one that looks fancy .
let' s see what he really thinks of himself .
go on , scaredy cat !
it' s my turn .
let me see .
i' m the scientist .
he' s going on .
i think he' il make it .
the sphinxes ' eyes , are they open or shut ?
let me see .
they' re shut .
the eyes are opening !
did he make it ?
did he ?
fancy armor doesn' t help .
the sphinxes can see straight into your heart .
listen .
next time let me see what happens .
it' s my telescope .
i' m going to try .
don' t go yet .
i haven' t told you about the next gate .
it' s even worse than this one .
he' il never make it .
don' t start to doubt yourself .
be confident .
be confident .
run , atreyu !
run , atreyu !
run !
now !
he made it .
he made it .
he made it !
you could use a dose of juicy vitamins , too .
he made it !
atreyu made it through the sphinx gate .
i always said he could do it .
good .
but that' s no reason to fall out of the basket again .
i knew he' d be safe .
nonsense .
you don' t understand anything .
the worst one is coming up .
next is the magic mirror gate .
atreyu must face his true self .
so what ?
that won' t be too hard for him .
that' s what everyone thinks .
but kind people find that they are cruel .
brave men discover they are really cowards .
confronted with their true selves ... ... most men run away screaming .
now , this is going too far .
what if they ... ... really do know about me in fantasia ?
the southern oracle ?
do not be afraid .
we will not harm you .
we have been waiting for you a long time .
are you the southern oracle ?
yes , we are .
then you must know what can save fantasia .
yes , we do .
well , what is it ?
i have to know !
the empress ... ... needs ... ... a new name .
a new name ?
that' s all ?
but that' s easy .
i can give her any name she wants .
no one from fantasia ... ... can do it .
only a human child ... ... can give her this new name .
a human child ?
where can i find one ?
you can only find one ... ... beyond the boundaries of fantasia .
ifyou want to save our world ... ... you must hurry .
we don' t know ... ... how much longer we can withstand the nothing .
falkor !
hurry , falkor !
the nothing' s everywhere .
don' t worry .
we' il reach the boundaries of fantasia .
do you know where they are ?
i have no idea .
then how do we find a human child ?
with luck .
faster , falkor !
we have to hurry .
all right , hang on tight .
what a shame they don' t ask me .
my mother ... ... she had such a wonderful name .
" on and on they flew until they reached the sea of possibilities ... " ... where they could go no further .
look , atreyu .
the nothing .
atreyu .
falkor !
where are you ?
atreyu !
where are you ?
they look like big ... ... good , strong hands , don' t they ?
i always thought that' s what they were .
my little friends .
the little man with his racing snail ... ... the night hob ... ... even the stupid bat .
i couldn' t hold on to them .
the nothing ... ... pulled them right out of my hands .
i failed .
no , you didn' t fail .
i' m the one who failed .
i was the one chosen to stop the nothing .
but i lost the auryn .
i can' t find my luck dragon .
so i won' t be able to get beyond the boundaries of fantasia .
listen .
the nothing ... ... will be here any minute .
i will just sit here ... ... and let it take me away , too .
they look ... ... like good ... ... strong ... ... hands , don' t they ?
morla ?
artax !
if you come any closer ... ... l will rip you to shreds .
who are you ?
i am gmork .
and you , whoever you are ... ... can have the honor of being my last victim .
i will not die easily .
i am a warrior .
brave warrior .
then fight the nothing .
i can' t .
i can' t get beyond the boundaries of fantasia .
what' s so funny ?
fantasia has no boundaries .
that' s not true .
you' re lying .
foolish boy .
don' t you know anything about fantasia ?
it' s the world of human fantasy .
every part ... ... every creature ... ... is a piece of the dreams and hopes of mankind .
therefore ... ... it has no boundaries .
why is fantasia dying then ?
because people have begun to lose their hopes ... ... and forget their dreams .
so the nothing grows stronger .
what is the nothing ?
it' s the emptiness that' s left .
it is like a despair ... ... destroying this world .
and i have been trying to help it .
but why ?
because people who have no hopes ... ... are easy to control .
and whoever has the control ... ... has the power .
who are you , really ?
i am the servant ... ... of the power behind the nothing .
i was sent to kill the only one ... ... who could have stopped the nothing .
i lost him in the swamps of sadness .
his name ... ... was atreyu .
if we' re about to die anyway , i' d rather die fighting .
come for me , gmork .
i am atreyu !
falkor !
atreyu !
" that was the end of fantasia .
" only a few fragments ofthis once ... " ... rich and beautiful world had been left by the nothing .
good old falkor .
can you see anything ?
anything at all ?
no .
all the land is gone .
i know .
and all because i failed .
you tried .
could the ivory tower still be standing ?
let' s hope so , atreyu .
let' s hope so .
let the auryn guide you .
if the ivory tower still stands , take us there .
the ivory tower !
the empress .
go on .
why do you look so sad ?
i have failed you , empress .
you haven' t .
you brought him with you .
who ?
the earthling child .
the one ... ... who can save us all .
you knew about the earthling child ?
of course .
i knew everything .
my horse died , i nearly drowned .
i just barely got away from the nothing .
for what ?
to find out what you already knew ?
it was the only way to get in touch with an earthling .
but i didn' t get in touch with an earthling !
yes , you did .
he has suffered with you .
he went through everything you went through .
andnow , he has come here ... ... with you .
he is very close , listening ... ... to every word we say .
what ?
where is he ?
lf he' s so close , why doesn' t he arrive ?
he doesn' t realize he' s already part of the neverending story .
the neverending story ?
what' s that ?
just as he is sharing all your adventures ... ... others are sharing his .
they were with him ... ... when he hid from the boys in the bookstore .
but that' s impossible !
they were with him when he took the book ... ... with the auryn symbol on the cover ... ... in which he' s reading his own story ... ... right now .
i can' t believe it .
they can' t be talking about me .
what if he doesn' t appear ?
then our world will disappear .
and so will l .
how could he let that happen ?
he doesn' t understand that he' s the one with the power to stop it .
he simply can' t imagine ... ... that one little boy could be that important .
is it really me ?
maybe he doesn' t know what to do .
what do i have to do ?
he has to give me a new name .
he' s already chosen it .
he just has to call it out .
but it' s only a story .
it' s not real .
it' s only a story .
atreyu , no !
bastian !
why don' t you do what you dream , bastian ?
but i can' t .
i must keep my feet on the ground .
call my name .
bastian , please !
save us !
all right !
i' il do it !
i' il save you .
i will do what i dream .
why is it so dark ?
in the beginning , it is always dark .
what is that ?
one grain of sand .
it is all that remains of my vast empire .
fantasia has totally disappeared ?
yes .
then everything' s been in vain .
no , it hasn' t .
fantasia can arise anew ... ... from your dreams and wishes .
how ?
open your hand .
what are you going to wish for ?
i don' t know .
then there will be no fantasia anymore .
how many wishes do i get ?
as many as you want .
and the more wishes you make ... ... the more magnificent fantasia will become .
really ?
try it .
then my first wish is ....
falkor , it' s even more beautiful than i thought !
like it ?
falkor , it' s wonderful .
falkor , it' s like the nothing never was .
atreyu and artax !
what would you like to wish for next ?
look , there they are .
it' s a monster !
get them , falkor !
let' s see how you like it , chickens .
down here .
we' re going to get you !
bastian made many other wishes ... ... and had many other amazing adventures ... ... before he finally returned to the ordinary world .
