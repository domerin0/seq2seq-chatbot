whoa .
don' t don' t don' t don' t you do that to me .
walter , that' s pushing it too far .
now , you listen to me .
now , you pay attention to me right now .
there' s no such thing as too far .
understand ?
you push everything as far as you can .
you push and you push and you push until it starts pushing back and then you push some goddamn more .
remember that when you' re with this guy today .
ok ?
oh , man .
if i start to die again , forget the hospital , i wanna croak here .
walter .
mr. novian , it' s an honor .
my associate ...
john anthony .
how are you ?
these sports services of yours ... complete fucking scam , huh ?
i hear your boy here' s having quite a season .
what' s your system , walter ?
system ?
let' s start with how much you bet .
million a game , across the board .
ok , is that the most we' re working with ?
it depends .
shit , benny , check your wallet .
see if you have any cash .
maybe he' il talk about the weekend .
how do you feel about it ?
do you rent that yacht ?
no , no .
i own it .
well , that' s how i feel about this weekend .
and i' m not being cocky .
i' m talking straight commerce with you , mr. novian .
i didn' t come down here to bullshit you .
wow , you got steamed .
or maybe a little inside information , maybe ?
i know these teams better than they know themselves .
i' m going 12 for 12 this weekend including the monday night parlay .
wow .
should we believe him ?
what do you think ?
i don' t believe him .
you cannot afford not to .
no , i can afford .
can you ?
honest question , mr. novian .
can you ?
hell , can anyone , for that matter , afford to lose as much as a man like you needs to bet to actually feel a win ?
winning' s a funny thing .
it' s one of those rare commodities that money cannot buy , until you called me .
i didn' t call you .
i called your boss .
and he called me .
the price is $250, 000 up front , plus 10 % of every game you win .
well , that' s wild .
i never paid up front before , did i ?
we' ve never charged it before .
considering whose picks you' re getting , and the amount of money you' re betting , 250' s a bargain .
you know it and i know it .
if you want this weekend' s winners , that' s my offer .
you can take it or leave it .
let' s step outside .
come in .
they need it , mr. anthony .
what' s your mother' s name , mitchell ?
sheila .
what street did you grow up on ?
atlantic avenue .
who do you like monday night ?
oh , i don' t know .
pick one .
well , that' s your job .
i' il do your job tomorrow .
today you do mine .
who do you like ?
what are you talking about ?
mitchie .
seattle v new orleans .
stop stalling .
who do you like ?
i don' t know .
i mean , i guess i like seattle , plus the two points .
over or under ?
no , you can' t ...
don' t ...
you can' t do that .
no , i can do this .
over or under ?
it' s 44 points .
come on .
um ...
over .
seattle in the over .
nice .
i won' t hand that in .
a million dollars are riding on that game .
oh , there' s a whole lot more than that .
we all know i can pick .
today i' m picking you .
the outcome will be the same .
ok .
and ... what if i' m wrong ?
there' s no " if .
are we running to the field goal ?
we don' t need a field goal .
we need a touchdown .
oh , that' s ok .
that' s ok .
they score , we win .
come on , come on .
they score , we win .
they score , we win .
they score , we win .
they score , we win .
they score , we win .
... first down on the sixth .
touchdown !
yes !
we won !
we won !
a hundred fucking percent !
a hundred fucking percent !
a hundred fucking percent !
a hundred ...
it was like he mesmerized me a little bit .
like spock or something , i visualized it .
seattle and the over and he wrote it down .
he said picking me was like him doing it .
how long have you been here ?
it' s not unusual to go out at any time
congratulations , brandon , or should i say john ?
either way , it' s amazing .
i am very impressed .
are you kidding me ?
letting salesmen make your picks ?
that' s balls .
you better get over there and collect some of that cash right now .
the way you' re picking , you' il need some for a rainy day .
enjoy it while it lasts .
gambling gods are a fickle bunch .
so easily offended .
there might be businesses you can make over two million dollars in a weekend ...
thanks for looking after me .
all right . ... but will somebody tell me , somebody please tell me , where else are you gonna have this much fucking fun ?
you the man !
you the man , big papa !
i love you forever .
let me ask you something .
how much of that do re mi be for moi ?
well , how about a one with five zeros behind it .
a hundred thousand ?
yeah .
on two mill ?
you be working out of my shop .
yes , sir , i am .
look around you .
this is your place , walter' s shop .
i understand that .
i' m just saying , feed the horse , baby .
maybe 10 % .
10 % ?
that what you' re thinking ?
that' s a beautiful thought .
forget it .
walter , we were starting to roll here .
and we got novian .
we got the 250 grand ...
i wanna tell you something now , ok ?
i' m gonna say it only once .
if you want something more from me than a gesundheit after a sneeze , you have to do more than this shit .
you understand ?
you' re gonna have to earn it .
once you earn it , you' il have to fight me for it .
you' il have to challenge me .
you' il have to rip it out of my fucking talons .
that' s how you get ahead with me .
now , john anthony would know that , see ?
as a matter of fact , next time you come to me with this shit , you come as john anthony .
i ain' t talking money with you .
hey , big winner , huh ?
how you feeling ?

hey .
let me ask you a question .
when you' re not at the salon , or running julia to play dates , or keeping walter in line , which i know is a full time job , what do you do for you ?
i stay busy .
you' re gonna turn here , so ...
that' s not what i asked .
what do you do for you , for toni ?
i was a junkie , brandon .
ok ?
so every day i get up and i wonder , " is this the day ?
is this the day i slip , end up back on the street ?
just keeping it all on track , that' s what i do for me .
well , that' s not living , toni .
that is not living .
that is maintaining .
that' s cashing in .
that is not living .
what the hell does that mean ?
are we talking perfection ?
you wanna talk perfection ?
no .
nobody' s perfect .
oh , except for me last weekend , going 14 and 0 , huh ?
this is your stop .
well , thanks for the ride ...
john .
in other action , washington melted down in miami , losing 24 to 12 .
saint louis shocked kc 34 14 , and philadelphia smacked pittsburgh 23 10 .
i' m gonna go work out .
no , you' re not .
there' s half a dozen games left here .
i want you to watch every second of every minute of every one of them .
all right , so sit down .
oakland is having a miserable time .
berman .
you know how you go three and 11 , don' t you ?
you go three and 11 when you make sunday' s picks on tuesday .
' cause it rained in cincinnati on saturday .
two starting quarterbacks never got to play .
that' s how you go three and 11 .
you' re a handicapper , not a psychic .
we still got monday and the parlay .
fuck monday and the parlay .
this isn' t about that .
this is about me .
it' s about the commission thing .
oh , no .
i don' t know .
oh , don' t bullshit me .
come on .
all right , listen .
i' m gonna bump you .
10 % .
ok ?
you earned it .
this is dangerous territory we' re getting into .
you understand ?
but i' il bump you .
now , talk to me about monday night , because everyone , i mean everyone , will double down after the hole you put ' em in .
it' s fine .
you' d bet your mother' s house ?
i don' t bet , walter .
if you did ?
i like the pick , walter .
on your mother' s house or not ?
with my mother in it .
another monday night thriller comes down to the final seconds .
carolina has to get at least into field goal range here .
high snap , pulled down nicely .
and a beautiful punt by feuderday .
he drills it .
thompson has to retreat .
and thompson dropped the ball .
the ball is on the turf , and the scramble is on .
it' s heading toward the carolina goal line .
a couple of guys jump on it .
it might be changing hands right now .
fuck !
the call goes to cleveland .
carolina won' t have a shot ...
fuck !
this one is over .
an unbelievable finish .
you don' t switch to a three four halfway through the season .
no , what defense are they running in practice ?
jones is on the field .
sunday .
we' re still leaning heavy on the overs .
thank you , thank you , sir .
you are the man .
i' il talk to you ...
his improvement' s been great , but he got out of surgery two and half weeks ago .
i know he' s had a good week of practice , but his knee' s swollen .
help me out .
game time decision .
that' s what coach always says .
are we talking game time probable , huh ?
or doubtful ?
tell me .
you' re going into ...
it' s raining , it' s snowing .
can his knee hold up in that ?
will the doc let him play ?
yes , he is a gamer .
thank you .
i can read between the lines .
you got it .
unbelievable !
yee ha !
takes the snap , drops the throw .
whoa !
hell of a swing .
sport of kings , right ?
no , no .
that' s horse racing .
what are you doing here ?
southie told me where i could find you .
yep .
i wanted to get out .
clear my head .
so talk to me .
how' d we do ?
you haven' t seen the scores ?
nope .
that' s how i wanted it .
make my picks , get the results later .
well ... highest sales volume ever .
yeah ?
take a guess how we did .
i think we kicked ass .
it was amazing .
yeah , last week was nothing , walter .
you' re right .
it was nothing compared to what we lost today .
what' d i go ?
i got an idea .
why don' t i give you a glimpse of what happened , and then you take a stab on how you went ?
just give me the numbers .
you don' t wanna play ?
too bad .
would' ve been fun .
grown men crying on the phone .
their wives screaming in the background .
three salespeople quit couldn' t take the pressure .
fuck .
no , no , no .
you lose ten out of 12 , " fuck " doesn' t quite cover it .
you know what would be more appropriate ?
holy fucking shit !
or " jesus fucking christ !
i got the picture , walter .
you' re right .
you go two for 12 on our highest volume weekend ever , and ... what' s left to say ?
except maybe we keep the phone number , only we switch it over to a fucking suicide hotline .
tomorrow morning , brandon , bright and early , we start all over again .
mr. novian wants to see you .
argh !
tell him ... to call me .
argh !

i didn' t recognize you without the suit .

this is not a good time .
i know , but , brandon , i need to talk to you .
it' s important .
not right now .
brandon , you have to ... you have to go .
no , i gotta ... get back on track .
it won' t matter .
you could win 100 games in a row and it won' t be enough .
it' il never be enough .
he will ride you into the ground .
i' il figure it out .
no .
brandon , please .
john anthony .
i' m wiped out , john .
amir .
my business , my house , my credit ... everything .
amir ?
it' s gonna be ok , all right ?
we' re gonna get back on track this weekend .
you hear me ?
still you talk like this .
who the fuck are you ?
like this is some kind of game .
you ruined me !
i was betting a few thousand a sunday when i called you , but you pushed me .
every call , all the time , with your talk .
i lost 380, 000 this weekend .
i was going to get married .
i had a life !
oh , no words now , huh ?
no more money to squeeze so you shut up .
how do you fucking live with yourself ?
come on .
that' s it !
coming , walter !
i know what the problem is .
he' s ok .
i' il come back later .
no , no , stick around .
stay , stay .
these guys are finished .
you guys want anything before you go ?
something to eat ?
you leave the way you came in , fellas .
thank you .
shut the door .
who' s that ?
we need a bat light or something .
one of them signals you shoot up into the clouds , so that no matter where you are , you just look up , you say , " hey , walter needs me .
because i must' ve beeped you a hundred fucking times .
who were they , man ?
the salvation army .
how does someone go one for eight ?
a fucking monkey tossing darts could do better than that .
what' s with all the money , walter ?
i got a plan .
we take your picks , we reverse everything .
like one of them twilight zone episodes where everything is opposite .
you say black , we go white .
how much is that ?
peanuts .
275, 000 .
that' s how desperate i am .
what happened to the two mill ?
two mill ?
man , i was carrying twice that in red ink before you even showed up .
look around .
everything you see is smoke and mirrors .
i got three mortgages on this house .
what do you wanna know ?
i' m gambling again !
to cover my losses , i just got a loan from a guy who works out of a bar on 106th and broadway .
trouble with me is , i start betting you heavy after you went 100 % , and i rode you right into the fucking toilet .
i do know what the problem is , man .
we' re gonna take care of all this shit .
check this out , man .
i' m brandon lang .
i' m the kid who played sports and loved sports .
i' m the kid who can pick winners .
i' m the kid you called in vegas .
along the way , i lost something in here .
i don' t know what , but i know i gotta go back to being me , to being brandon .
if i get back to being brandon ...
you can pick again .
of course .
forget john anthony .
burn the suits .
mm hm .
my fault .
i fucked with you .
only two games .
two over unders .
that' s right .
if i get you to crunch the numbers , sprinkle a little brandon magic over it .
we get the salespeople burning up the phones ...
come monday we go four for four .
four for four .
that' s something .
how' s that sound ?
this is important , you know ?
i know it is .
pressure doesn' t help .
let' s go eat something .
let' s go to smith and wo' s .
brandon' s gotta stay and do some homework .
the brandon thing .
you see , i' m forgetting .
two games .
two games .
two games .
two games .
two games .
two games .
hey , what ...
ho !
people living in the zone .
what does that mean ?
his hair was all over .
brandon made these picks ?
you' re looking at him .
new york in the under .
tennessee in the over .
sell ' em hard .
hello and welcome .
the conference championship game is underway .
can i watch , daddy ?
come to daddy .
my angel .
i need you to root for me .
you see that team ?
those are the bad guys .
we don' t want them .
that' s atlanta .
we want the good guys , the blue team .
that' s new york .
and new york has gotta win by more than five points , only you gotta root for a low score , ok ?
because both teams together have to make less than 42 points , total .
all right , so it' s new york in under 42 points .
all right ?
smith is wide .
cohn changing the play , audible lies .
at the line of scrimmage .
he doesn' t like the defense .
robinson in motion to the left .
jones alone in the backfield .
cohn back to passer .
he' s got the rookie .
anderson is in the middle ...
go , go , go !
in the end zone .
yeah !
touchdown , new york , and they take the early lead .
midway through the second quarter now .
atlanta down 10 0 , but they' re making their first serious threat of the game .
thomas , delay action ...
get him !
over the top .
touchdown , atlanta !
10 7 and new york is on the move .

i am going to guarantee our picks this weekend .
what' s that mean ?
what does that mean ?
it means this .

that' s risk free .
now let' s go to the oracle ,
god' s gift , john anthony .
wow .
that' s all i can say .
the phones are gonna be flooded , walter , and they should be .
hey , john , why don' t you run down the pitfalls facing the average bettor ?
i mean , when you think about it , a game this huge , all the added dynamics ...
i mean , uh , without your expertise ,
i guess the average bettor might as well just , what , flip a coin .
walter ?
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
hang on .
you can' t guarantee that they' re gonna win .
that' s insane .
come on .
i say if you can flip a coin to make a pick , i can guarantee the game .
what if we lose ?
ah , fuck it .
i' m ruined anyway .
look , man .
cover your ass , all right .
at least cap the thing out , right ?
oh , brandon , can' t you feel it ?
what ?
can' t you just feel it ?
i have no idea what you' re talking about .
oh , i think you do .
i think you do .
you know , the best part of the best drug in the world ain' t the high .
it' s the moment just before you take it .
the dice are dancing on the table .
between now and the time they stop , that' s the greatest high in the world .
made up your mind yet ?
it' s the last minute !
i' m here to make you money !
new york' s the one and a half point favorite , the over and under is 36 .
i want you to bet new york in the over .
come on , guy , it' s a fucking lock .
it' s new york in the over .
you can parlay it , tease it , do whatever you want , ' cause it' s guaranteed .
our reputation is the guarantee .
tammy !
i' m coming .
28 years in the business , we' re not going anywhere .
can we please get some air in here ?
you gotta make up your mind .
ok , that' s it .
kill the phones .
come on .
right now .
let' s go , let' s go .
they come from new york and kansas city in this match up .
the opening kickoff is coming up next .
we are under way in super forty .
it' s a high end over ender .
down the middle .
jackson gets it , a short one for the 15 , tries to angle over to the right side , stripped away from ...
kansas city comes up with it .
ah , man .
harris getting to the outside , turns , clear path .
boy , does he have blocking .
touchdown , kansas city .
shit .
sets out for the pocket .
simpson .
he' s open .
guns one over the middle , simpson on the completion .
it' s second and 15 .
setting up , he' s got time again .
go , go .
looks down field and the slam intercepted .
what the fuck is that ?
dawkins finds a wave of blockers .
over to the near side , he' s going to go the distance .
touchdown , kansas city .
14 nothing , kansas city over new york .
new york' s got it now for the third time in the game .
back to throw once again , pocket collapses and down it goes .
oh , man .
you better hold on to that coin you flipped , because this game keeps up like this , i' m gonna have to borrow it .
well , it' s not over yet , walter .
i wouldn' t change my bet .
hm ?
and second and long , second and about a dozen .
can they get something started ?
what are they counting on today ?
do they have to get away from the balanced attack we' ve seen all season ?
will they lose the ground game now ?
will they go over to the pass ?
well , there is no way they' il be able to run when they' re 14 points down .
handoff goes to the second man through .
it' s jones , fullback , off the right side .
he' s got room , downfield he goes .
will anybody catch him ?
deep into the secondary now .
touchdown , new york .
extra point makes it 14 7 , kansas city .
kansas scores on the eight play drive , capped with rogers' s 32 yard run .
and that' s the end of the third quarter .
it' s kansas city , 21 , new york , ten .
back to throw once again .
post available ...
let' s go ! ... beats the safety down the right side .
he' s in !
all right !
it' s kansas city , 21 , new york , 17 .
what a final four minutes we' re going to have .
where' s brandon ?
i don' t know .
where' s brandon ?
we' re back in it , babe !
new york touchdown and we win both bets !
hey !
hey , brandon ?
i believe this' il be their final possession .
can they do it ?
can they get it done like they have all year long ?
they' re trailing by four .
don' t forget , the new rule doesn' t apply here .
they' ve gotta get into the end zone .
he left .
i know .
you didn' t tell me ?
how about that ?
no goodbye , no ... no nothing .
i' m sure it' s all there in the letter .
i' m sure it is .
i wonder what' s not in here .
what do you mean ?
what do you mean , what do i mean ?
he had enough .
he wanted his life back .
he said that to you ?
well , loud and clear , by leaving .
i think it was something else .
yeah ?
tell me .
you know .
no .
you have no idea ?
you' re missing the game , walter .
oh , no .
this is the game .
on first down , the handoff is to jones .
he' s on the right side .
he' s got a blocker .
and a first down .
but he' s dropped inbounds .
nice .
i guess brandon was homesick .
i don' t know .
or maybe he had such deep feelings for me that he couldn' t face saying goodbye .
wait a minute .
i just got an idea .
just came to me .
i mean , out of the blue .
what about this ?
brandon didn' t tell me he was gonna leave because ... you let him fuck you .
back to pass , rolls under the left side .
guns it over the middle , it' s complete .
edwards has it , all the way down to the 44 , kansas city .
oh , god .
you deny it ?
oh , my god .
do i have to , walter ?
you know you did .
oh , you ...
another lock of the year ?
i saw you , toni .
i saw you and him , that night .
i never went to vegas .
you mean you lied to me about the trip .
oh , don' t talk to me about lying .
i guess you had the whole thing set up .
oh , don' t make this about me .
just put me out there on a tray ?
i put a tray out there .
you didn' t have to shove a fucking apple in your mouth and sit on it !
he' s looking for his hot receiver .
edwards , again , got it !
kansas city , 23 .
admit it !
you played me , walter .
you' re fucking a i did .
it worked .
didn' t it ?
with eight seconds left , new york has to spend their final time out .
brandon was right .
but you don' t deny it ?
it' s the best pick he ever made .
i don' t know what that means .
deep drop sets up in the pocket .
fires over the middle .
batted down at the line !
so after everything , it all comes down to one final play .
you were gambling with me that night , walter .
with me !
brandon knew it , because he knew you .
he told me he was sure you were watching somehow .
so he asked me in to spend the night and put on a little show for you , walter .
but i didn' t believe him , walter .
oh , god , i didn' t believe him .
i mean , after all we' ve been through .
so i figured , you know , " what the hell ?
he slipped out the back , no big deal .
he never even stayed here .
and you .
you were in such a good mood the next day .
i figured , " thank god , because he must' ve been wrong .
otherwise , why wouldn' t he confront us , confront me ?
oh , walter .
so it all boils down to this .
can new york find the end zone ?
this is what players dream of .
the chance to win it on the final snap .
you wanted to lose !
like i was something you could just toss on the table !
only we booked your bet , walter , brandon and me , who evidently love you more than you love yourself .
spreads the defense .
drops back to throw .
here comes the pressure .
he bounces to the right side .
your fantasy is to end up alone with nothing !
i won' t let that happen .
understand ?
i will never let that happen to you .
this is it .
he' s on the run , picks up a big block downfield .
this is real , walter .
you and me and julia , we' re all that' s real .
one man to beat .
this is it , walter .
he goes airborne from the five .
does he get in ?
he' s in !
he' s in !
touchdown , new york !
apaches , win this game , a whoosh !
giants , with me !
over here with me !
this side , this side , this side , right in front of me , right here .
take a knee , take a knee , take a knee .
