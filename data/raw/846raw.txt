hey , you want to hear my short story now ?
i could read it to you .
you mean , again ?
i changed the ending a little .
oh .
what happens now ?
well , actually , it' s the same but longer .
i think it' s better .
more ... raw .
then maybe you should just read the ending .
but it won' t make sense if you hear it out of context .
i think you should leave it the way it was .
it was good .
so you don' t want to hear my new ending ?
you' il read it in class tomorrow .
surprise me .
anyway , i have to go .
i promised melinda i' d help her with her oral .
you' re tired of me , i can tell .
marcus , i' m tired , that' s all .
you' ve lost interest .
you hardly even sweat anymore when we have sex .
i was never much of a sweater , you know that .
look , vi ,
i don' t blame you .
you feel pity now .
pleasure isn' t there anymore .
the kinkiness is gone .
you' ve become kind .
when he saw her , it was as if he could walk like a normal person .
his legs didn' t swing , his arms didn' t spaz away .
he wasn' t a freak anymore , for she made him forget his affliction .
no more cerebral palsy .
from now on , cp stood for ...
' cerebral person . '
he was a cerebral person .
i thought that was really good , marcus .
really ... moving and emotional .
i thought it was really emotional , too .
and , i mean , really good word choices .
it kind of reminded me a little of faulkner , but east coast and disabled .
or flannery o' connor .
she had multiple sclerosis .
and borges ... he was blind .
updike has psoriasis .
maybe i' m wrong , but ...
i' m afraid i found the whole thing to be a little trite .
its earnestness is ... well ... it' s a little embarrassing .
those adjectives are flatfooted and redundant .
i' m sorry , i mean ... anyway , don' t ... what do i know ?
don' t even listen to what i say .
i mean ...
anyone else ?
catherine is right .
your story is a piece of shit .
you express nothing but banalities , and , formally speaking , are unable to construct a single compelling sentence .
you ride on a wave of clichs so worn , in fact , it actually approaches a level of grotesquerie .
and your subtitle " the rawness oftruth " is that supposed to be a joke of some sort ?
or are you just being pretentious ?
okay .
who' s next ?
marcus , wait up !
what do you want ?
don' t be so upset , it' s okay .
what the fuck are you talking about ? !
what' s okay ?
he hated my story also .
you story was terrible .
marcus , you' il write something better next time .
patronizing fuck !
if you had been honest with me in the first place ,
i wouldn' t have read it .
i knew it was shit , but like an idiot , i believed you .
that' s notfair , i was honest .
just because i wasn' t sucking up like that bitch , catherine
i sure didn' t hear you voice your opinion when it mattered .
i admit it , i was scared .
i was shocked , in fact , by what he said .
and he' s so convincing .
i' m sorry if i let you down , but really ...
i still say he' s just one opinion .
i don' t even like his books that much .
they' re all so ... aggressively confrontational .
i don' t care if he' s won the pulitzer prize .
you just want to fuck him , like catherine and every other white cunt on campus .
marcus , you can' tjust unilaterally decide to end things .
this is a relationship we' re talking about , a friendship .
you don' t just ...
fuck you !
fuck him !
fuck him !
fuck him !
vi , are you okay ?
yes , i' m okay .
i' m totally okay .
you did the right thing .
i know that .
fucking cripple .
why do i waste my time with undergrads ?
they' re all so ... juvenile !
i just thought marcus would be different .
i mean , he' s got cp .
what are you going to do now ?
i don' t know .
go to a bar , get laid , whatever .
don' t worry about me , i' il be justfine .
what can i get you ?
i' il just have a beer .
here you go .
hi .
hello , vi .
what are you doing here ?
what are you doing here ?
i' m sorry , i didn' t mean ...
i just didn' t expect to run into you here , that' s all .
well ... now you have .
yeah .
then , are you alone ?
can i join you ?
thanks .
well ...
i just wanted to say that i' m really happy with the class .
i know you must hear this all the time , but i' m also a great admirer ofyour work .
a sunday lynching " especially ... really ... spoke to me .
god , i hope i' m not embarrassing you .
you' re not .
good .
because ...
i really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was .
that' s good .
i also agreed with what you said today about marcus ' story .
it is a piece of shit .
you have beautiful skin .
thank you .
catherine seems like she might become a really good writer .
maybe .
she' s okay .
aren' t you going out with catherine ?
i' m sorry , it' s none of my business .
i didn' t mean ...
i' m not going out with catherine .
do you think i have potential as a writer ?
no .
thank you for being honest .
i have so much respect for you .
can i just freshen up for a second ?
it' s over there .
thanks .
don' t be a racist .
don' t be a racist .
don' t be a racist ...
it' s really a nice place you have .
is the rent high ?
take offyour top .
now ... take off the rest .
turn around .
bend over .
say ...
nigger , fuck me .
but i can' t say that .
say ...
ni ...
ni ... ... gger . ... gger .
say , " nigger .
nigger .
fuck me hard .
fuck ... me ... hard .
say , " nigger , fuck me hard .
nigger , fuck me hard .
again .
nigger , fuck me hard .
again .
nigger , fuck me hard .
again .
nigger , fuck me hard .
again .
nigger , fuck me hard .
again !
nigger , fuck me hard .
again !
nigger , fuck me hard !
freak .
can i come in ?
you' re all ... sweaty .
so john flipped her around , and slammed her against the wall .
jane braced herself .
she thought about her mother .
she thought about peter .
she thought about god ... and rape .
say , ' fuck me , nigger , fuck me hard . '
john' s flesh abraded her soft skin .
there would be marks .
she acquiesced and said what he asked her to say , and did what he asked her to do .
she had entered college with hope , with dignity , but she would graduate as a whore .
why do people have to be so ugly , write about such ugly characters ?
it' s perverted .
i know you all think i' m being prissy , but i don' t care .
i was brought up in a certain way , and this is ... mean spirited .
yeah .
well ... it did seem a little ... affected .
like by using taboo language , you were trying to shock us about the hollowness of your characters .
i think it was a little bit racist .
it was completely racist .
beyond that , i felt deeply offended as a woman .
as if women could only operate from experiences of objectification .
totally phallocentric .
so weirdly misogynistic .
why does jane go through with this ?
is she stupid ?
hey , but wasn' t this a rape ?
or did i miss something ?
i' m confused , because if this was a rape , then why would she be a whore ?
it was confessional , yet dishonest .
jane pretends to be horrified by the sexuality that she in fact fetishizes .
she subsumes herself to the myth of black male sexual potency , but then doesn' t follow through .
she thinks she respects afro americans , and thinks they' re cool and exotic what a notch he' d make in her belt
but of course , it all comes down to a mandingo clich , and he calls her on it .
in classic racist tradition , she demonizes , then runs for cover .
but then , how could she behave otherwise ?
she' s just a spoiled suburban white girl with a benetton rainbow complex .
it' s just my opinion , and what do i know , but i think it' s a callow piece ofwriting .
callow ... and coy .
jane wants more , but isn' t honest enough to admit it .
in the end she returns to the safety of her crippled translation , sexually impotent ... boyfriend .
this is bullshit !
her story was the truth !
right .
it' s unbelievable !
it' s clichd !
it' s disgusting !
but it happened !
i don' t know about what happened , vi , because once you start writing , it all becomes fiction .
still ... it certainly is an improvement over your last story .
there is now at least a beginning , a middle , and an end .
toby , i just know you' re going to become a movie star .
please don' t forget me when you make it to the top .
i will always love you .
pam .
hello ?
hello .
is this pam ?
who is this ?
toby oxman .
toby ?
oh , hi .
how are you ?
i' m fine , how are you ?
great .
great !
so what' s going on ?
i was going to ask you that .
but you called .
oh , yeah .
well ...
i was just calling because , well ...
i was wondering if you still remembered me , which i guess you do .
yeah .
so , look atwhere we are .
the year 2000 !
can you believe it ?
did you ever think we would actually make it ?
well , yeah .
so , are you still acting ?
no .
not anymore .
no ,
i kind of came to terms with myself .
i realized i had done what i had to do , and it was time to move on .
what did you do after you gave up on acting ?
i went to law school , if you can believe that .
i believe it .
well , it was really ... all kind of a joke and a rip off , the whole thing , so i dropped out .
that' s too bad .
well , but then it got me writing , so that was a good thing .
anything i might know about ?
well ...
i kind of let things go on this novel i' d been really into .
the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt .
really , it' s finished .
that' s too bad .
i worked over at a homeless shelter for a while , drove a cab to pay the rent , but that was ...
i mean , i have some dignity .
that' s good .
so then what do you do now ?
i' m a documentary filmmaker .
oh ?
anything i might have seen ?
not yet .
i' m hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers .
remember when we were teenagers ?
yeah , you didn' t want to take me to the prom .
i don' t remember that .
i do .
well ... but it was so long ago .
we were so different back then .
well , anyway ...
i' m looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia .
it' s kind of an exploration of the psyche , of its mythology .
i wrote to derrida to see if he' d like to do the narration , but everything' s still kind of in development at this point .
i work in a shoe store right now .
but it' s cool , i' m not ashamed .
i have a much stronger sense of self now .
and anyway , it' s really very temporary .
that' s good .
yeah .
so anyway , tell me , what about you ?
i' d heard through the grapevine that you were producing movies .
yeah , but not anymore .
oh .
tired of life in the fast lane ?
yeah .
so , you' re ... married ?
kids ?
yeah .
how many ?
three .
great .
how old are they ?
eight , six , and four .
wow , that really is great .
in a few years , maybe they' il want to be in my documentary .
listen , toby , i can' t really talk right now .
do you mind if i call you back ?
yeah , sure .
okay .
bye .
okay , bye .
maybe she has caller id .
do you have any hobbies ?
no , not really .
any books you like to read for fun ?
no .
how ' bout those underground comics ?
i hate reading .
all right , scooby , let' s not beat around the bush .
with your attitude , you won' t get in anywhere .
okay .
okay .
so you just don' t care ?
let me ask you something , not as your guidance counselor , but as a friend .
what do you want to do with your life ?
what kind of long term goals can you possibly have ?
i don' t know .
come on , you can talk to me .
tell me what you' re thinking .
i mean ,
i want to be on tv .
maybe have a talk show or something ,
like conan or early letterman .
uh huh .
how is it you hope to achieve this goal ?
i don' t know .
see if i have any connections ?
did you knock on his door ?
yes , but he just shouted at me and used the " f " word .
scooby , dinner !
would anyone be interested in being hypnotized after dinner ?
no .
let' s just start .
i don' t know what' s wrong with that kid .
maybe he' s gay .
don' t ever say that .
what if he is ?
he isn' t .
marty , ignore him .
he' s vegetarian , doesn' t do sports
brady !
and even if he is ...
gay people are people too , you know .
you' re just being prejudiced .
i don' t care if he' s gay .
i' m cool .
it' s not like i have to share his room .
i just want to know what he does in his room that' s so interesting he doesn' t come down for dinner .
maybe he' s building a bomb , just like
don' t even joke about that .
i' m serious .
what happens if he blows up the school ?
that' s it , i' m going in there .
fuck !
was anyone in my room today ?
is everything okay ?
my cd case like totally collapsed .
i have to recatalog all weekend .
hey , can you pass the salad over ?
steak' s really good tonight .
good .
you have a lot of homework ?
i don' t know .
what do you mean ?
you either got a lot or you don' t .
what' s not to know ?
marty .
you started filling out your college applications yet ?
i' m not going to college .
what are you going to do ?
i don' t know .
what do you know ?
dad ,
i' m trying to figure things out right now , okay ?
it' s like , really hard ... and i' m just listening to some old elton john ...
gay .
out .
leave the table .
what ?
you heard me .
leave the table !
man , i' m out of here .
this family is so fucked !
mom , it' s not fair if brady can say the " f " word and i can' t .
mikey , listen up , ' cause here' s a lesson .
life' s not fair .
i' il talk to you later .
i' il see you later .
later .
thanks , esposito .
consuelo ?
consuelo ?
yes , mikey ?
do you have any brothers or sisters ?
yes .
really ?
how many ?
four brothers and five sisters .
why did your parents have so many children ?
i mean , if they were poor , wouldn' t it be better to just have one or two ?
it was god' s will .
but do you really believe in god ?
heaven , hell , and angels and all that kind of stuff ?
no .
so ... how was school today ?
the same .
the same .
the same as what ?
just the same .
we' re studying the holocaust in social studies .
oh , yeah ?
we did the same thing last year also .
how is the class ?
i' m supposed to watch " schindler' s list " for homework .
the movie' s , like , almostfour hours .
then i' m supposed to write a report on survivors .
you know any survivors , dad ?
do i know any ?
personally ?
technically , your zeda is a survivor .
he was in a concentration camp ?
no , but he had to escape the nazis .
but i thought he came over to america before the war .
he did , with his family .
but his cousins , they had to stay and they were all killed .
if he' d stayed , he would' ve been killed .
so in my book , he' s a survivor .
even though it was only his cousins that were killed ?
that could' ve happened to him , or to me , if i' d been alive .
or you .
or me ?
you mean , then we' re all survivors ?
well , yes .
if it hadn' t been for hitler , he wouldn' t have had to leave europe .
we would' ve been european .
but then , in a sense , since you would' ve never met dad if your family had stayed in europe , if it weren' tfor hitler none of us would' ve been born .
get the hell out of here .
man ... !
it' s just , like , conversation .
tell me ... you make a living at this ?
well , sir ,
i' m actually not doing this for the money .
when you make a documentary , you do it for many reasons .
but money is certainly not one of them .
i don' t get it .
well , sir ... a lot has happened to the landscape of the suburban high school since i was a student .
i feel it would be a valuable , perhaps even enlightening endeavor , to chronicle the changes .
to get intimate with the realities kids and parents face in american schools today .
yeah , well , whatever .
i' il let you know ifthere' s interest .
excuse me , where' s the bathroom ?
you a pervert ?
no .
actually , i' m a documentary filmmaker .
you mean like " blair witch project " ?
well , no .
um ...
i' m doing one on high school students , in fact .
what for ?
well , it' s kind of ... it' s kind of a sociological study on the aftermath of columbine .
is this , like , to get into sundance ?
yeah , it' s possible they would be interested in it .
doubt it .
actually , there is some interest from the sundance channel .
hbo and mtv have also shown some interest .
so you have connections ?
we' re trying to do a film on suburban lifestyles .
kind of an " american family " for the new millennium .
i thought this was about kids getting into college .
oh , it is .
which is it ?
you got to keep your focus straight .
yeah , you' re absolutely right .
the focus is on the college admissions process today .
and you want scooby to be the focus of all this ?
scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds .
you didn' t mention any other students before .
i don' t have any yet , but
either scooby is the focus or forget it .
yeah , i thought i was the focus .
i want to be the focus .
toby , we need this to be a positive experience .
i suppose i could reconceive .
reconceive .
scooby does have a quality ... that i' ve been looking for .
a quality that is emblematic of america today .
it' s part disillusionment , part hope .
twinkies !
boys , take napkins .
napkins .
not to be crass , but what do we get out of this ?
don' t worry , he doesn' t mean money .
i know .
i know that .
well ... sharing your story , your ups and downs and so forth , can , i hope , be an illuminating experience .
yeah .
how do we know we won' t be exploited ?
no , it' s true .
mr. livingston , i fully understand and i share your concerns .
you feel vulnerable .
i know this is a very difficult question but what it comes down to is ... can you make the leap offaith in me , the same way that i have to make the leap offaith in you ?
this is a great school ,
i don' t care what anybody says .
it' s not perfect , but the people are really cool
iike the teachers and kids they really care and all .
i know they make fun of new jersey all the time , but i don' t care , ' cause they' re just snobs .
' cause jersey is where america' s at !
walking down these hallways hallways just like the ones
i once walked down as a teenager ,
i couldn' t help thinking back to a time when every day i woke up depressed , suicidal , consumed by despair .
had things changed ?
was the competition to get into the most prestigious schools still a requisite rite of passage ?
beneath these masks of courtesy and friendliness ,
i knew that there were darker forces at work .
and i knew that scooby was the key to revealing the truth .
scooby , scooby , scooby .
what are you thinking ?
college , sats , your parents , your brothers , your friends ...
how is it you deal with all this stress ?
the pressure to get into the college ofyour choice is incredible .
they did a study recently ofthe youth in bosnia during the bombing .
they found that the stress the young people experience there was less than what american high school students go through when applying to college .
is that right ?
yeah .
my god .
so what do you think ?
i' m not really sure what you' re trying to say .
it' s funny , i suppose .
but it seems glib and facile to make fun of how idiotic these people are .
i' m not making fun .
i' m showing it as it really is .
you' re showing how superior you are to your subject .
but i like my subject .
i like these people .
no , you don' t .
yes , i do !
i love them .
the camerawork' s nice .
thanks .
i' il tell mike .
well ... it' s still just the beginning .
i know i can ... dig deeper .
but , marj ...
may i call you marj ?
what it really boils down to is , what does it mean to be a jew ?
exactly .
tzedakah ... charity .
and the new wing at beth israel is ...
actually , last year you gave $500 .
but this year , $1, 000 would not only be a mitzvah , it would bring you to a new level
yes , of course .
your gift would also give you a chagall menorah and two tickets to the dinner dance this spring .
because it' s true .
israel needs us now .
if not now , when ?
that' s wonderful .
i' il speak to you next week .
you too .
take care .
hi , scooby .
scooby ...
scooby ?
how was school today ?
fine .
ready for tomorrow ?
what' s tomorrow ?
the sats , knucklehead .
i' m not taking them .
just ... back ...
mom ?
yes , mikey ?
i was looking through one of scooby' s sat practice books and i took one of the practice tests .
guess what score i got ?
what ?
550 verbal , 520 math , and i' m only in fifth grade .
scooby ?
yeah ?
we have to talk .
what do you want to talk about ?
don' t screw around with me .
you know what i' m talking about .
you' re taking those sats .
you' re taking those sats or your cd collection' s history .
you' re taking those sats and you' re going to college .
you' re taking those sats if i have to strap your ass to a chair , but , buddy , you' re taking them !
okay .
i' m tired of this shit .
were you surprised that scooby took the sats after all ?
not really .
he' s kind of a wuss .
okay .
how about you , cheryl ?
were you surprised ?
i don' t know .
whatever .
how come you drive such a shitty car ?
i don' t know .
that' s interesting .
a cool car .
is that something that' s real important to you ...
brady ?
a cool car ?
yeah .
duh .
that' s pretty cool , stanley .
thanks .
how did you get it ?
it' s my dad' s .
he hides it under some old tv guides in his closet .
gee .
your dad' s smart .
i know .
is it loaded ?
no ...
i don' t think so .
scooby , don' t !
be careful .
i' m not an idiot , man .
i watch tv .
i know .
i' m sorry .
i' m just a little nervous .
i don' t know why .
you should be .
here .
you can keep it .
scooby ?
yeah ?
you know ...
i like you .
yeah .
i know .
i mean ...
i know .
everyone knows .
do you think ...
do you think that ... you' d let me ...
okay .
if you feel like it .
just give me a second .
you want some ?
no , thanks .
i' m sorry !
i should have never made you take the sats .
oh god !
i' m burning to death !
i' il never do it again !
hey , scooby .
how' s it going ?
conan o' brien ?
what are you doing here ?
i' m looking for a last minute guestfor my show .
any suggestions ?
i' il be your guest .
really ?
well , all right .
let' s take a look at the television , and see how we look .
cool .
welcome to the show , scooby .
nice to have you here .
great to be here .
thank you for dressing up for us .
this is very classy .
tell us , what kind of professional plans do you have ?
what' s in your future ?
well ...
i was thinking
i might work for you .
tell me , what do you want to do for me ?
what' s your idea ?
be your sidekick .
and maybe , eventually , become a tv talk show host .
tv talk show host ?
okay .
you were at sidekick eight seconds ago , then tv talk show host .
you' il be a latin dictator in about a minute .
let' s see what they think of the first idea .
i' m curious what the audience thinks .
what do you think , should scooby be my new sidekick ?
scooby , new sidekick , everybody .
what' s up ?
there' s something i need to talk about with you .
what ?
there' s some rumors ...
like what ?
you know ...
stanley .
what ?
like , don' t take this the wrong way .
i mean , i' m cool .
but ... you know ...
i' ve got a good reputation at school .
well ...
i really don' t want it ruined .
no problem .
i' m cool .
thanks , scoob .
esposito , what the fuck do you think you' re doing ?
you' re tackling like a bitch on my football team , son .
you better bend your ass over and hit somebody , understand me ?
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
understand me ?
then do it !
livingston !
that' s the way to hit that hole , son .
we' re going to become a football team today .
let' s move the ball !
move , move , move !
break !
i want to see you hit those holes .
defense , fill those goddamn gaps !
let' s go , guys .
let' s do it .
set left , set left .
red , 1 7 ...
red , 1 7 ...
hut !
hut !
hut !
when i' m in high school ,
i' m not going to play any football .
i' m just going to concentrate on class rank .
what did you do in high school ?
i did not go to high school .
weren' t there high schools in el salvador ?
we had to work .
my family was poor .
it must have been hard being poor .
i am still poor .
but , consuelo , even though you' re poor , don' t you have any hobbies or interests or anything ?
no , mikey .
but , like ... what do you like to do when you' re not working ?
i am always working .
but when you' re not , like now , what do you like to do ?
this is work .
but it' s not like ... real work .
this is just babysitting .
you know , your job' s really not so bad , if you think about it .
you should smile more .
when the sky is clear and the sun is warm , you' re reminded of how beautiful things can be .
a lamppost ... a sign ... a straw wrapper , blowing in the wind .
but when that dark cloud appears , you realize how fragile the balance of life is .
when brady first arrived to the hospital ,
he was unresponsive to verbal stimuli .
we performed a ct scan which demonstrated a large subdural hematoma with mass effect .
since the removal of the subdural , he' s been in a coma .
when i first met the livingstons it was in the first 24 hours of brady coming in after his tragic football accident , and they were acting in a fairly typical way .
we' re not the ones that need help .
my son needs help .
my son' s in there .
he can' t even feed himself .
i don' t even know if he' s going to be a vegetable or not , for christ' s sake !
but what about scooby ?
how would this affect him ?
what meaning is to be found in this ?
this is definitely better .
you think so ?
you don' t think that this might not be a little dry ?
this is not an entertainment you' re making .
this story about a kid in the suburbs , and the state of the college admission process , has , with this brady crisis , evolved into something much richer and more provocative .
yes , i know .
still , it should be somewhat entertaining .
without this footage , without this rigorous documentation , it would feel like exploitation .
no , no , no .
no exploitation , this is serious .
but don' t you find it a little funny , too , at the same time ?
you' ve got a family tragedy on your hands .
will you tell me what' s funny about that ?
about a kid in a coma ?
nothing , i guess .
why are you making this if you can' t treat your subject with appropriate gravity ?
okay , you' re right .
you' re right .
we need to screen what we' ve got .
invite some regular people , just some random off the street types , and see what real people think of this .
i don' t know , toby .
we really have a long way to go .
you still need to get a lot more footage .
it' s probably a little premature
then we can invite serious intellectual types .
we' re not ready .
hip alternative types ... who understand the process .
toby , we' re not ready !
i need to see this with an audience .
what' s an audience gonna tell you ?
i don' t know .
maybe they' il like it .
consuelo !
i spilled some grape juice on the floor .
consuelo ?
consuelo ?
are you crying ?
no .
yes , you are .
i can tell .
what' s the matter ?
mi jesus .
mi jesus .
speak english .
mi jesus est muerto !
consuelo ,
i' m sorry , but you know if you don' t speak english ...
i can' t understand you .
my jesus .
who is jesus ?
my baby .
you have a baby ?
my grandchild baby .
i didn' t even know you had any children .
but why are you so upset about jesus ?
he is dead .
how did that happen ?
he was executed .
he was on death row ... and then he was executed .
how did they execute him ?
poison gas .
maybe it' s for the best .
i mean , if he was guilty of doing something wrong .
people who are bad should be killed .
don' t you think so ?
jesus was not bad .
maybe he was and you just didn' t know it .
he wasn' t .
but still , you can' t be sure .
i am sure .
but really , you never know .
i know !
why was he on death row ?
for rape and murder .
consuelo , what is rape , exactly ?
it is when you ...
love someone ... and they don' t love you , and you do something about it .
sometimes i feel like my parents don' t love me .
well , then , when you get older , you can do something about it .
consuelo ?
i spilled some grape juice upstairs .
do you think you could clean up the floor now ?
dad ?
do you think that brady will ever get better ?
one in a million recover .
maybe he' s that one in a million .
mikey , there' s optimism , and then there' s stupidity .
it' s a very fine line .
i don' t think there' s any hope either .
i was just trying to make you feel better .
thanks .
you' re welcome .
dad ?
would you let me try hypnotizing you now ?
yeah , sure .
go ahead .
hypnotize me .
okay .
stay there .
i' il be right back .
just a sec !
be right there .
could you turn around to me ?
just turn .
thanks .
all right .
you must look at this shiny object ... and concentrate .
relax your legs .
relax your arms .
relax your shoulders .
now keep your eyes on the shiny object .
your eyelids are getting heavy .
heavier .
you' re getting sleepy .
sleepier .
now let your eyes close shut ... and you are sound asleep .
now ... you are completely under my power .
i am the only voice you can hear , the only voice you will listen to .
now ... when you wake up , you will be in a good mood .
you won' t worry so much about brady .
and i will be your favorite from now on .
if brady dies , you can be sad for a little bit , but i will still be the most important person in your life .
you will never be mean to me , and always give me whatever i want .
also , you should fire consuelo .
she' s lazy .
now , when i snap my fingers , you will remember nothing , but you will do everything i have asked .
one ... two ... three .
hey , mikey , want to get some ice cream ?
okay !
it' s like , yeah ...
i caved in .
i mean , i had to .
my parents , they' re like ... still really depressed about brady .
so i wrote the bullshit essay , filled out the applications , did the interviews ...
i figure i can always drop out .
where did you get in ?
princeton .
what did you get on your sats ?
200 verbal , 710 math .
kinda weird , i know , but i think they thought it was , like ... good weird .
we used pull .
you have to .
sometimes you just have to , toby .
what kind of pull did you have ?
i have a cousin .
very big giver to the alumni fund .
it' s all about who you know .
look , we' re not suckers .
everyone else is out there doing the same thing .
he' s right .
damn , toby .
it' s too hard .
this thing won' t open again .

yeah .
listen , why don' t you go upstairs and keep your mom and brady company for a bit ?
i need to speak alone with consuelo for a moment .
sure , dad .
take off .
consuelo ...
mrs. livingston and i have discussed this , and we' ve come to the conclusion that we are not very happy with your work lately .
so we' re going to let you go .
i don' t understand .
we' ve been happy with you in the past , but now we think , maybe it' s time for a change .
i know you' ve had trouble at home .
maybe some of that is reflecting on your work .
but , mr. livingston ...
i work very hard for you ... and your family .
i understand .
i' m sorry it had to end this way .
florsheim , can i help you ?
hi , i' m trying to reach toby oxman .
sorry , he' s offtoday .
okay .
um ... thanks .
hey , mike .
is toby here ?
no , he' s not .
do you have any idea where he might be ?
i think he' s at a test screening .
i think scooby' s like a lot of kids .
he just hit a speed bump .
now he' s going to find his way , his path' s going to be clear , and i think he' s going to continue his education at a good college .
and everybody else is going to be happy .
mr. livingston , aren' t you a bit fearful that scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism ?
i don' t know why this is so hard for you to comprehend .
i had a terrific time in college .
i' ve got a terrific job , a comfortable salary , terrific wife , three terrific kids , and every year i give to the alumni fund .
now , why are you trying to make college out to be a bad thing ?
a negative experience ?
you had a bad time ?
well , too bad !
get over it !
stop trying to impose your misery on others by going around saying ,
life is bad .
life is horrible .
life is tough on you ?
well , boo hoo !
well , yeah .
my dad is kind of a goofball .
you just have to ... pretend to go along with his ideas ,
' cause he really doesn' t get it .
like , i could be the next oprah ... for all he knows , but he' s never even seen the show .
what is most important to you ?
i don' t know .
i' d like to be good at something .
it doesn' t have to be tv .
i mean ... it could be movies ... anything .
i' d be willing to direct .
i' d like to be ... you know ... famous .
not necessarily a superstar .
just famous .
be recognized .
get fan mail ... things .
scooby , now i understand how you want to be like a tv talk show host and all ,
like conan o' brien , but did you know that even he went to college ?
he did ?
yeah .
he went to harvard .
... one police officer , eight others were wounded ...
mom ?
dad ?
can i sleep with you ?
i' m scared .
sure , buddy .
come on .
come in bed with us .
come on .
snug as a bug in a rug ,
yeah , there you go , pally .
you' re monster proofed .
scooby ...
oh my god , scooby .
i' m so sorry .
i' m so , so sorry .
don' t be .
the movie' s a hit .
