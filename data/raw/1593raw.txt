the towns people waited three months to catch the first glimpse of the pistol .
finally the day had come .
no one had ever laid eyes on a more beautiful gun .
it was everything they thought it would be .
someeven thought it was too beautiful to look at .
it was considered to be an honor and good luck ... to be the first hand that fires a new y fashioned gun
especiallyone as beautiful as this ,
made for the hand of a nobleman .
the townsman was in a trance at the gun' s flawless craftsmanship .
it backfired , killing him instantly .

' cause my granny barzel , she had hands like a circus midget .
howcome you can' t live with jerry ?
do you know jerry ?
jerry has trouble expressing his feelings .
he had a really fucked up childhood .
his mom is nuts .
one of those people who thinks the iron is always on .
don' t you love him ?
i think that' s the problem .
we love each other too much .
but he' s just he' s so selfish .
and it' s like we' ve been living his life forever .
he' d tell you a different story altogether , but i give and i give , and he just keeps taking .
our counselor totally agrees with me , by the way .
chuckles
i don' t put much stock in those weirdo counselor types .
all they do is sit around in bare feet and smoke joints .
maybe that' s true , but it doesn' t change the fact that jerry' s a taker and i' m a giver .
it' s obvious .
you know , a lot of people are under the impression that you get to choose who you love .

of course you are .
you' re taking his side .

sowhat' swith this " we' ve been livin ' his life forever " thing ?
a figure of speech .
i didn' t mean it literally .
jerry' s been working for margolese for five years less a day .
it just feels lifelong .
sounds like jail terms .
it is .
arnold margolese is in jail because jerry put him there .
jerry ratted out arnold margolese ?
no . jerry was coming across ventura .
you know , over there by laurel canyon .
yeah .
he wasn' t paying attention , ran a red light , smashed into margolese' s cadillac .
when the cops came , margolese got busted because he had a person in thetrunk .
that' s how margolese got sent to jail ?
mm hmm .
live person or dead person ?
live person .
huh . what' sthe big deal, then ?
he probably wasn' t gonna stay that way .
he was taped up in a trunk for a reason, wasn' t he ?
god , i would think this was right up your alley , swifty .
he saw something .
well, whatever it was this guy saw ... or was going to say to the cops , he got the chance .
and since it was technically jerry' s fault , margolese had him work off the jail time .
chuckles you see , my whole relationship has been hijacked ... because he doesn' t pay attention when he drives .

look , i' m not gonna kill ya .
but i am gonna have to shoot you .
but why , sir ? why ?
why ? why ?
because you stole from me , and you know about the pistol and you' re just gonna steal again .
and i can' t have you coming back in this situation like a fly in the ointment .
no !
i won' t be a fly !
you' il never see me again .
look, you' re gettin ' shot , and that' s it .
it' il take you time to get to the next town ,
especially if you' re limping .

limping ?
can' t you just tie me up some more ?
i mean, fuck ! you shoot me ? tie me !
yeah .
i don' t have a rope .
so you shoot me ?
it' s the american way .
where do you want it ?

wait, wait, wait .
not the left .
sorry .
on the count of three .
one .
screams
look , i' m agreeing with you .
but there' s a few ways to look at it .
now , sex is , no matter what anybodysays , a very important part of any relationship .
the fact that jerry is a considerate lover says a lot .
you lost me .
well , he' s a considerate lover .
you just gotta find a way to get him to expand this quality he has during sex ... to other areas of your relationship .
i mean , even ifit only comes out in sex , it' s there just the same .
that' s a good point .
if a person' s a considerate lover , he can' t be all selfish , right ?
unless of course he' s
he' s , uh , being a considerate  what wast hat ?
what ?
that . that moment you had .
what moment ?
leroy, you just checked out that guyand had a moment .
that was a ... moment .
i don' t know if it was a moment .
whispers are you gay ?
as in " happy " ?
as in homosexual .
what does my sexual orientation have to do with anything we' ve been talking about ?
nothing .
clears throat nothing .
excep tsomething that you said back there really bugged me , and this would kind of help it make sense .
yeah ?
what' s that ?
i asked if you were gonna rape me , and you said , " not likely .
you said itso matter of fact , like i was repulsive ... and it was ludicrous to think that i was actually at risk of you wanting to have sex with me .
first of all , it' s a crime of anger , not attraction .
and second of all, you' re not repulsive .
you' r every beautiful .
thank you .
you want me to rape ya ? are you gay ?
you want me to rape ya ?
you' re gay .
laughs you' re gay .
i knew it !
oh , i so knew it .
i just knew it .
what a relief .
what do you want , a medal ?
you want a little trinket saying you identified a homosexual ?
no . are you full throttle ?
chuckles full throttle ?
yeah , i guess i am .
oh .
i' m not i mean
i' m not trying to be a smart ass or anything like that .
i just i just think that this is great .
wow .
this is
this is ... major , okay ?
i know the kind of people in your business .
okay ?
yeah ?
and to me , it seems that , well , being gay isn' t really ... conducive to the environment .
oh .
like i should be an interiordecorator .
that' s insulting .
i am very good at what i do . do you have a boyfriend ?
no , i don' t .
unfortunately , i seem to be unable to keep ... relationships together .
seems like everybody' s having trouble keeping relationships together .

can you tell me , uh, what happened here ?
that' s not accurate , i' m afraid .
the gunsmith did craft this pistol fora prospective husband , and he was a nobleman' s son, true .
but the mot if was darker , my friend .
it' s cursed , this gun .
the key to this tale involves the gunsmith' s assistant , a poor , but honorable young man in blinding love ... with the gunsmith' s daughter .
for months at a time , the assistant took to the mines , gathering the precious metal ... that would yield the most beautiful gun that ever existed , only to discover that what he hoped would be a wedding gift for him , was for another .
the gunsmith insisted his daughter marry the nobleman' s son , forbidding their love .
so , angered in his bitter pain , the assistant cursed the gun , vowing the creation would never prevail .
but the gunsmith was racing against time .
he had promised a pistol of unparalleled craftsmanship , the nobleman' s dowry hanging in the balance .
he worked day and night to correct the pistol' s problems .
this gun never worked properly .
some say its very creation ended the gunsmith' s life .
well , my friend, you' re free to go , but without the gun .
this gun doesn' t belong to you or to your boss .
now it belongs to me .
man yeah, vegas .
it can be tough that way .

expensive ?
man ]
yeah , emotionally .
let' s just say that i had a serious relationship problem .
oh . you fit right in here .
what do you do now , frank ?
now , i am ... a postman .
get out of here .
that' s so rigid .
swear to god .
no , come on .
there' s a seedy underbelly to the postal service .
is that the key to it ?
and that' s the key .
you have no idea how many small , unmarked brownpaper packages i deliver .
what , porno ?
yeah , daily .
like what ?
videos , blow up dolls , dildos , pocket pussies .
don' t leave nothing out .
oh, yeah ?
hmm .
but, you know , even with all that dirty excitement at my fingertips ,
i still have to take off once a year .
so i just walk out the front door and i know i' m going to vegas .
i just don' t know how .
all i' ve got is my wallet and an attitude .
i don' t know , it keeps me sane .
after all , guns don' t kill people .
postal workers do .
muttering in spanish
okay, you' re all set , mr. shurker . if you go to the front there , a shuttle will take you to your car .
what kind of car is it exactly ?
it' s a chrysler , sir , brand new .
you wouldn' t happen to have something a little more  raoul !
yeah , man !
yeah .
never fear , teddy' s here .

whistles
speaking spanish
comeon, jerry .
the mexican thief , the dirtycop ?
i mean, the word is out .
it' s a big ticket item .
a lot of fucking people are interested in that gun .
no fucking way .
is that what they think ?
that i' m selling them out ?
i don' t know, jerry .
maybe they think you' re scared and might do the wrong thing .
ted .
you know , i don' t know .
i' m just doing my goddamn portion here .
yeah , and what is that ?
to find out what' s going on , assess the damage , try to calm you down , help find the pistol , get us home .
i tell you something , i get on that plane , pistol or not , that' il be the last fucking flight i evertake .
oh , come on, jerry .
" come on, jerry ? " you know it .
i know what i' m supposed to know .
just doing your fucking part .
i know what i' m supposed to know !
you hear yourself .
you sound like fucking schultz from hogan' s heroes .
german accent i know nothing !
goddamn it, jerry !
i' m not crazy about nayman running things any more than you are .
but i got a few years on you , and i' m telling you, the thing to do is keep your nose clean ,
look straight ahead and do what you' re told .
oh , god .
that' s why i' m 17 months of payments away from boca raton .
' cause i do my fuckin ' portions .
now , i don' t care how you look at it .
the first step out of this is to get the pistol back .
i never took a payoff in my life .
jerry , look .
i know where your loyalties lie .
but the kid' s dead .
the pistol' s gone .
i mean, you can see how it looks , right ?
come on, jerry .
you' re my guy .
