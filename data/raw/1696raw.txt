' when i was a little kid ,
' my mother told me not to stare into the sun .
' so once , when i was six , i did .
' the doctors didn' t know if my eyes would ever heal .
' i was terrified ,
' alone in that darkness .
' slowly ,
' daylight crept in through the bandages
' and i could see .
' but something else had changed inside me .
' that day i had my first headache . '

mr cohen ?
marcy dawson here again , from lancet percy .
i checked my schedule and i' m in chinatown tomorrow at three .
i' d love to stop by to meet you .
it' il be worth it for us .
how' s three sound ?
how did you get my address ?
i got it from columbia .
three it is .
looking forward to it .
wait a minute ...
max .
stop thinking , max .
just feel .
use your intuition .
what did you think of hamlet ?
i didn' t get to it .
it' s been a month .
you haven' t taken a single break .
i' m so close .
have you met the new fish my niece bought me ?
i named her lcarus after you , my renegade pupil .

but life isn' t just mathematics , max .
i spent 40 years searching for patterns in pi .
i found nothing .
you found things .
i found things ... but not a pattern .
' not a pattern .

personal note .
' sol died a little when he stopped research on pi .
' it wasn' t just the stroke .
' he stopped caring .
' how could he stop ,
' when he was so close to seeing pi for what it really is ?
' how could you stop believing that there is a pattern ,
' an ordered shape behind those numbers , when you were so close ?

hey , max .
lenny meyer .
i' il put it out .
so ...
what do you do ?
i work with computers .
math .
math ?
what kind of math ?
number theory .
research mostly .
no way .
i work with numbers myself .
i mean , not traditional .
i work with the torah .
amazing !
hebrew is all math .
it' s all numbers .
you know that ?
look .
ancient jews used hebrew as their numerical system .
each letter' s a number .
the hebrew a , aleph , is 1 .
b , bet , is 2 .
understand ?
but look , the numbers are interrelated .
take the hebrew for father , ab .
aleph , bet .
1 , 2 equals 3 .
the word for mother , haim .
aleph , mem .
1 , 40 equals 41 .
the sum of 3 and 41 , 44 .
right ?
now , the hebrew word for child mother , father , child .
yelev .
that' s 10 , 30 and 4 .
44 .
torah is just a long string of numbers .
some say that it' s a code , sent to us from god .
that' s kind of interesting .
that' s kid' s stuff , check this out .
the garden of eden , kadem .

you can take those numbers ...
those are fibonacci numbers .
they' re ... ?
you know , like the fibonacci sequence ?
fibonacci ?
fibonacci is an ltalian mathematician in the 13th .
if you divide 144 into 233 ,
the result approaches theta .
theta ?
theta .
the greek symbol for the golden ratio , the golden spiral .
wow .
i never saw that before .
that' s like that series you find in nature ?
like the face of a sunflower ?
wherever there are spirals .
see , there' s math everywhere .

what ...
what' s happened ?
first , i get these crazy low picks , then it spit out this string of numbers .
i never saw anything like it .
and then it fries .
it crashed .
you have a print out ?
of what ?
of the picks , the number ?
i threw it out .
what number did it spit out ?
i don' t know , a string of digits .
how many ?
i don' t know .
what is it , 100 , 1 , 000 , 216 ?
how many ?
probably around 200 .
why ?
i dealt with some bugs back in my pi days .
i wondered if it was like one i ran into .
have you met archimedes ?
the one with black spots .
see ?
you remember archimedes of syracuse ?
eh ?
the king asks archimedes to determine if a present he has received is actually solid gold .
unsolved problem at the time .
it tortures the great greek mathematician for weeks .
insomnia haunts him and he twists and turns in his bed for nights on end .
finally , his equally exhausted wife , forced to share a bed with this genius , convinces him to take a bath , to relax .
while he' s entering the tub , he notices the bath water rise .
displacement a way to determine volume , and thus a way to determine density .
weight over volume .
and thus archimedes solves the problem .
he screams " eureka ! " and he is so overwhelmed , he runs naked through the streets to the king' s palace to report his discovery .
now , what is the moral of the story ?
that a breakthrough will come .
wrong !
the point of the story is the wife .
listen to your wife , she' il give you perspective .
meaning , you need a break .
you must take a bath or you' il get nowhere .
there will be no order , only chaos .
go home , max , and you take a bath .
excuse me .
can i take a look at the paper ?
oh , my god .
six and a half .
hey ...
hey !
the paper , please .
mr cohen ?
perfect timing .
i was going to head home .
who are you ?
marcy dawson .
we were meeting .
it' s really not ...
it' s such a pleasure to finally meet you .
i studied your paper ...
excuse me .
let' s take my car .
i can' t .
mr cohen ...
yes !
i just threw out something .
i didn' t realise i needed it .
just a print out .
i lost my data .
whoa !
i' m sorry .
max .
how' re you doing ?
lenny meyer .
where you going ?
up there .
you got five minutes ?
do you wanna try tefillin ?
not now .
i' ve a car to go to the shul .
you got a car ?
that' s my friend , ephraim .
let' s go .
great .
when you said you' re max cohen ,
i didn' t realise you were the max cohen .
your work' s revolutionary .
it' s inspired the work we do .
it has ?
very much so .
the only difference is , we' re not looking at the stock market .
go ahead .
wrap that round your hand .
we' re searching for a pattern in the torah .
what kind ?
we' re not sure .
all we know is it' s 216 digits long .
ok , stand up , please , max .
216 ?
that' s right .
you' ve gotta be quiet now .
stand up .
216 ?
shh .
this goes on your head .
look at me , max .
right here .

now , what' s up , max ?
what is this 216 number , sol ?
excuse me ?
you asked me if i' d seen a 216 digit number .
oh , yeah .
you mean the bug .
i ran into it working on pi .
what do you mean ran into it ?
max , what' s this about ?
there are these religious jews i' ve been talking to .
religious jews ?
yeah , hasids , the guys with beards .
i know them .
i know one in a coffee shop .
he' s a number theorist .
the torah is his data set .
he says they' re after a 216 digit number in the torah .
come on , it' s just coincidence .
there' s something else , though .
what ?
you remember those weird stock picks ?
yesterday' s stock picks ?
yes .
they were correct .
i got two picks on the nose .
smack on the nose , sol .
something' s going on .
it has to do with that number .
there' s an answer in it .
max ...
come with me .
the ancient japanese considered the go board to be a microcosm of the universe .
although , when it' s empty , it appears simple and ordered , the possibilities of gameplay are endless .
no two go games are alike , just like snowflakes .
so , the go board actually represents an extremely complex and chaotic universe .
and that' s the truth of our world , max .
it can' t be easily summed up with math .
there is no simple pattern .
but as the game progresses , the possibilities become smaller .
the board takes on order .
soon , every move' s predictable .
so ?
so maybe , even though we' re not aware of it , there is a pattern , an order underlying every go game .
maybe it' s like the pattern in the stock market ?
the torah ?
this 216 number ?
it' s insanity .
maybe it' s genius .
i must get that number .
hold on !
you' re losing it .
you have to breathe .
listen to yourself .
you' re connecting my computer bug with one you might' ve had and some religious hogwash .
if you want the number 216 , you can find it everywhere .
216 steps from your street corner to your front door , 216 seconds you spend in the elevator
when your mind becomes obsessed you filter everything else out and find that thing everywhere .
320 , 450 , 22 , whatever .
you' ve chosen 216 and you' il find it everywhere in nature .
but , max , as soon as you discard scientific rigour , you are no longer a mathematician , you' re a numerologist .
mr cohen ?
mr cohen ...
god damn it !
i' m sick of you following me .
i' m not interested in money .
i want to understand our world .
i don' t deal with materialists like you .
i' m sorry .

new evidence .
' remember pythagoras .
' mathematician , cult leader .
athens , circa 500 bc .
the universe is made of numbers .
' the golden ratio .
' best represented geometrically as the golden rectangle .
' visually , there exists a graceful equilibrium
' between its length and width .
' when it' s squared , it leaves a smaller golden rectangle behind ,
' with the same unique ratio .
' the squaring can continue , smaller and smaller ,
' to infinity .
' 11 : 18 .
more evidence .
' remember da vinci .
artist , inventor , sculptor , naturalist .
' ltaly , c15th .
' rediscovered the perfection of the golden rectangle
' and pencilled it into his masterpieces .
' connecting a curve through the concentric golden rectangles ,
' you generate the mythical golden spiral .
' pythagoras loved this shape , for he found it in nature
' a nautilus shell , rams ' horns , whirlpools , tornadoes ,
' our fingerprints , our dna and even our milky way .

personal note .
' when i was a little kid ,
' my mother told me not to stare into the sun .
' so once , i did .
' at first , the brightness was overwhelming ,
' but i kept looking , forcing myself not to blink .
' and then the brightness began to dissolve .
' my pupils shrank to pinholes and everything came into focus .
' and for a moment i understood .
' my new hypothesis : if we' re built from spirals ,
' while living in a giant spiral ,
' then everything we do is infused with the spiral .

they' re going down ... down ... down .
you lied to me .
you have it ?
ok , sit down .
i gave up before i pinpointed it , but my guess is that , er , certain problems cause computers to get stuck in a loop .
the loop leads to meltdown , but just before they crash they become aware of their own structure .
the computer has a sense of its own silicon nature and it prints out its ingredients .
the computer becomes conscious ?
in ...
in , er ... some ways ...
i guess .
studying the pattern made euclid conscious of itself .
it died spitting out the number .
consciousness is the number ?
no , max .
it' s only a nasty bug .
it' s more than that .
no .
it' s a dead end !

answer me .
listen .
this is really big .
i don' t wanna hurt you .
did you give it to them ?

you' re all right .
i' m rabbi cohen .
cohen , like you .
i' m sorry for what lenny did .
he' s been reprimanded .
it' s not our way .
are you ok ?
yeah .
max , you have to give us the number .
what is it ?
the talmud tells us it began 2, 000 years ago , when the romans destroyed the second temple .
what is this ?
max , you' il understand if you listen .
the romans also destroyed our priesthood , the cohanim .
and with their deaths , they destroyed our greatest secret .
in the centre of the temple was the heart of jewish life , the holy of holies .
it was the earthly residence of our god .
the one god .
it housed the ark of the tabernacle , which stored the original 10 commandments which god gave to moses .
only one man was allowed to enter this holy of holies on one day , the holiest day of the year , yom kippur .
on the day of atonement , all of lsrael would descend upon jerusalem to watch the high priest , the cohen godul , make his trip to the holy of holies .
if the high priest was pure , he would emerge moments later and we' d have a prosperous year .
it meant we were one year closer to the messianic age .
but , if he was impure , he would die instantly and it meant we were doomed .
the high priest had one ritual to perform there .
he had to intone a single word .
yeah ?
that word was the true name of god .
so ?
the true name , which only the cohanim knew , was 216 letters long .
are you telling me that ...
that the number in my head is the true name of god .
yes !
it' s the key to the messianic age .
it will take us closer to the garden of eden .
as the temple burnt , the talmud tells us the high priest walked into the flames .
he took the key to the top of the building , the heavens opened and received the key from the priest' s outstretched hand .
we have been looking for that key ever since .
and you may have found it .
that' s what happened .
i saw god .
no .
you are not pure .
you cannot see god unless you are pure .
no ...
i saw everything .
you saw nothing , only a glimpse .
there' s so much more .
we can unlock the door and show god we' re pure again .
you' re not pure .
how are you pure ?
i found it !
who do you think you are ?
you are only a vessel from god .
you' re carrying a delivery meant for us !
it was given to me .
it' s inside of me .
it' s changing me .
it' s killing you !
because you are not ready to receive it .
it' s just a number .
i' m sure you' ve written down every 216 digit number .
you' ve translated all of them .
you' ve intoned them all .
haven' t you ?
what' s it gotten you ?
the number is nothing .
it' s the meaning .
the syntax .
it' s what' s between the numbers .
you haven' t understood it .
it' s because it' s not for you .
i' ve got it .
i' ve got it !
i understand it .
and i' m gonna see it .
