an american legal student wants to see me for a moment .
what time is sir john due ?
12 . 30 , sir .
right .
come in !
hi .
how very nice to see you .
am i interrupting ?
absolutely not .
really ?
really .
delighted to see you .
hello .
so .
this is the place .
this is it .
very nice .
i was at the courts this morning .
it' s fascinating !
really , so much to know ,
everybody wears these .
do you ?
oh , ridiculous !
well , erm
i only have a few minutes .
sorry .
i' m sorry .
but until then , i' m all yours , as they say .
i just have a couple of questions .
i' m having a little problem understanding preliminary criminal procedures .
what exactly is the committal ?
ah .
interesting .
basically , it' s a preliminary investigation where the prosecution presents evidence that the accused has a case to answer .
that' s what it says in the book .
let' s take , for example , my friend george thomason .
right .
his committal is on wednesday ...
thomason ?
yes .
george thomason ?
yes .
do you know him ?
i' m defending him .
what are you talking about ?
i' m his barrister , his lawyer .
that' s so great !
that' s so weird , isn' t that weird ?
oh , i' m so happy you' re defending him !
thank you .
he' s sure to get off now .
wow !
i can watch you work now !
please .
amazing .
well , anyway .
at the committal , george would then plead ...
not guilty .
really ?
the evidence is largely circumstantial .
but wasn' t there an identification ?
true , but a very elderly lady .
i think they' ve got the wrong man .
you don' t think he did it ?
no .
let' s just say , for argument' s sake , that you did think he did it .
sure , if more evidence against him came to light .
right , right .
you would then advise him to plead guilty , and turn over the jewels to get his sentence cut .
and he would turn them over to who , to you ?
theoretically , yes , yes .
oh , of course .
erm .
well er ...
i' m so sorry , i' ve forgotten your name .
wanda .
wanda !
what a fool , what a fool .
well , wanda , there are three ...
not wanda gershwitz ?
yes .
oh , my god .
what ?
you' re his alibi .
i can' t talk to you !
why not ?
my dear lady , you' re a defence witness !
i' m sorry , i must ask you to leave .
what did i say ?
it' s not ethical for me to talk to a witness .
everybody does it in america .
not in england , it' s forbidden .
i insist , or i may have to give up the case .
i' m sorry .
please .
oh , archie .
i didn' t come here to talk about boring criminal procedures .
come on , you know !
you knew the minute i walked in here .
i want you .
what ?
hello ?
sir john is here .
show him in , please .
make love with me .
pardon ?
nothing .
will you take me to bed ?
no , sorry .
bye , uncle .
hi !
he' s pleading not guilty so you' re safe until the trial .
leach doesn' t think he did it .
ken says there' s a safe deposit box key , but only george knows where it is .
thank you , wanda !
what have you found out ?
not a lot .
you realize he' s in court tomorrow ?
i know that !
so nothing , huh ?
nix .
zip .
diddly .
bupkiss .
niente .
oh , it' s too big !
no , it isn' t , portia .
it' s enormous !
no , it isn' t !
oh , please , mother !
no !
absolutely not !
i' m so miserable and you just don' t care !
do shut up , portia !
all i get , all day , is people complaining to me .
oh dear .
ecco i' uomo .
ooh , le due cupole grandi della cattedrale di milano .
benito mussolini !
dov' il vaticano ?
volare
oh oh
e cantare
oh oh ...
archie , i want you to speak to her about plastic surgery .
hmm ?
i do wish you' d listen to me .
i want you to speak to portia .
i' il speak to her in the morning .
goodnight , archie .
goodnight , archie !
goodnight , wanda .
goodnight , who ?
sorry , darling .
just a stupid case i' ve got tomorrow with some lousy old hag .
are you george francis thomason of kipling mansions , murray avenue ,
london w9 ?
yes , sir .
the charge is one of armed robbery .
are we ready for a committal , mr. percival ?
yes , under section 6 . 2 , madam .
that is correct , 6 . 2 .
here are the statements , all to be fully bound , please .
stand up , mr. thomason .
you are committed to stand trial at the central criminal court .
there is some urgency about this case .
the main witness , mrs. coady , is elderly and has had serious heart difficulties recently .
is there any possibility that this case might be put down for an early trial ?
that is for the old bailey listing officer .
take him down to the cell , please , officer .
hi , hon .
how are you doing ?
you look great .
i love your hair .
got time for a coffee ?
no , i' ve g g ...
have you thought about it ?
why did he give you this ?
eileen coady , 69 basil street .
does he want you to send her flowers ?
do her shopping ?
show her a good time ?
rub her out ?
he wants you to rub her out ?
he' s going to kill her !
fuck off , or i' il kill you .
limey fruits !
so the old lady will m meet with an accident ?
eh , k k ken ?
sssh .
sssh !
what' s so funny ?
nothing .
just that wasting old ladies isn' t nice .
well , it' s better than b buggering people .
i bet you one pound you don' t kill her .
all right .
all right .
i love watching your ass when you walk .
is that beautiful or what ?
don' t go near him !
he' s mine ! one pound says you won' t kill her !
when could you look at it ?
let' s think .
my wife' s going to the opera on friday .
i' il look at it then and call you on saturday .
i really appreciate it .
thanks .
bye .
hi .
i know we' re not allowed to talk .
give me a call .
i can' t .
please ?
we' re not allowed to speak .
we don' t have to .
i don' t want you for your conversation .
i' d love to ...
what happened ?
got a date , friday .
look here !
do you mind not making that terrible noise ?
my dogs will be having their nap .
nice doggy .
nice ... doggy .
otto , what are you doing ?
it' s a buddhist meditation technique .
it focuses your aggression .
the monks did it before they went into battle .
what kind of buddhism is this ?
asshole !
it' s an early tantric meditation ...
what is this ?
to get information , i might have to get friendly with him .
well , we' re ready now , at last .
good .
enjoy the opera , darling .
your supper' s in the fridge .
marvellous .
be good .
when you say friendly , what are we talking about here ?
cordial ?
courteous ?
supportive ?
what ?
i don' t know .
let' s just see what happens .
so , friendly might include actual er what , penetration ?
i don' t need your jealousy now .
jealousy ?
yes .
hey , i' m merely curious .
me ?
jealous of that fop ?
what about my tits ?
does he get to handle them ?
yes .
that' s my forecast .
i' il stand by that .
nuzzling ?
i think $20 million is worth a nuzzle .
80 % chance there .
sucking ?
i thought you weren' t jealous .
i' m not , i don' t believe in jealousy , it' s for the weak .
one thing , though .
touch his dick , and he' s dead !
i told your father to get the car serviced .
aren' t we going , then ?
oh , do shut up , portia .
hurry up .
hi .
do you despise me ?
no , that' s not a word that leaps to mind .
can i stay , then ?
of course .
look , ...
wanda ...
i know .
your wife' s coming back .
no , it' s not her .
she' il be hours .
it' s about what i said to you .
it is all right for us to speak .
it is ?
provided that we don' t discuss the case .
oh .
oh , fine .
it' s just , if anyone saw us talking ...
oh , but they won' t .
sorry if i seem pompous .
oh , you' re the best , archie .

i know .
i just meant theoretically .

hello , honey .
what happened ?
n n nothing .
what' s that ?
er ...
not granny ?
not yet .
oh .
who is it for , then ?
a f f f ...
a fish ?
frenchman ?
a phone operator ?
friend .
oh , a four legged one ?
where' s my sister ?
she' s in the b b b ...
thank you .
lavatory .
wanda !
anything ?
what ?
no ?
why are you here ?
i' m here because i' m bored !
bored , wandering around this awful city , shoving george' s pic ...
talking to a lot of snotty , stuck up , intellectually inferior british faggots .
they get rigor mortis in the prime of life in this country !
standing there with their hair clenched counting the seconds till the weekend , so they can dress up like ballerinas at the flat at four 2b , saint ...
to be honest , i er ... hate them .
i mean , pretending they' re so fucking lawyer ...
so fucking superior with those phoney accents .
not you , ken .
you' ve got a beautiful voice when it works .
son of a bitch !
so er ...
want to have some lunch ?
have you heard from him ?
who ?
archie .
no , i have to finish my hair !
nothing ?
ok , i' m out of here !
no plans to see him ?
no .
ok , bye , bro !
bye , wanda !
oh , sorry .
what ? !
it wasn' t theirs to sell .
a old lady gave it to them to engrave .
someone put it in the display cabinet ...
that' s their problem .
no .
legally ...
you paid for it !
they accept their mistake and they' re offering you this .
it' s much more valuable .
i adore this and you want me to give it back ...
i don' t want ...
they can' t have it .
wendy .
no .
no !
wendy !
no !
tell them they can' t have it !
you' re the bloody barrister !
hello .
hello .
oh , archie , it' s beautiful .
it' s just beautiful .
oh , my god , look !
oh , archie , it' s beautiful .
isn' t it wonderful ?
whose is it ?
it belongs to someone at the chambers .
and where are they ?
hong kong .
ah so .
gone for weeks .
nice rug , archie .
may i ?
archie , what are you doing ?
the polka , i think .
you make me feel free !
free ?
do you have any idea what it' s like being english ?
being so correct all the time ?
being so ... stifled by this dread of doing the wrong thing ?
asking someone , ' are you married ? ' and hearing , ' my wife left me . '
or saying , ' do you have children ? ' and hearing , ' they burned to death yesterday . '
wanda , we' re all terrified of embarrassment .
that' s why we' re so ... dead .
most of my friends are dead .
we have these piles of corpses to dinner .
but you' re alive , god bless you .
and i want to be .
i' m so fed up with all this .
i want to make love with you , wanda .
i' m a good lover .
at least , i used to be in the early 14th century .
can we go to bed ?
yeah .
hang on !
mind your head .
agh !
aagh !
aaagh !
aaagh !
i think i love you , wanda .
oh , archie .
can i ask you a question ?
anything .
where' s my locket ?
i couldn' t get it .
what ?
wendy wouldn' t give it back .
look ...
i got you this instead .
do you like it ?
no .
archie , i have to have mine .
what' s the matter ?
why ?
my mother gave it to me on her death ... bed .
oh , i' m sorry .
all right , darling .
i' il get it for you .
you promise ?
i' il think of something .
sex is very , very difficult for me with somebody that i don' t trust completely .
i promise i' il get it .
ok ?
ooh !
i love you , archie .
i' ve loved you ever since the first second i saw you !
what was that ?
what ?
your brother didn' t bring you here this time ?
no .
he' s no idea ?
he doesn' t have a clue .
what ?
he is so dumb ...
really ?
he thought the gettysburg address was where lincoln lived .
those terrible lies he told about the cla !
so painful !
when he heard your daughter' s name was portia , he said , ' why did they name her after a car ? '
i love the way you laugh !
i love you , you' re funny .
how come a girl as bright as you can have a brother who' s so ...
don' t call me stupid .
jesus christ !
ouch !
otto !
come on !
i' il deal with you later !
what have you done with her ?
she' s all right !
otto !
now , apologise .
what ?
shit !
are you totally deranged ?
you pompous , stuck up , snot nosed ,
english , giant twerp , scumbag , fuck face , dickhead asshole !
how very interesting .
you' re a true vulgarian , aren' t you ?
you' re the vulgarian , you fuck !
now , apologise !
what ?
me to you ?
apologise .
all right , i apologise .
you' re really sorry ?
i' m really , really sorry .
i apologise unreservedly .
you take it back ?
i do .
i offer a complete and utter retraction .
the imputation was totally without basis in fact , and was in no way fair comment .
it was motivated purely by malice .
i deeply regret any distress my comments may have caused you or your family .
i hereby undertake not repeat any such slander at any time in the future .
ok .
miserere dominus
miserere dominus
canis mortuus est
you said you loved him !
right , otto !
here' s a multiple choice question .
a. wanda was lying .
b. wanda was telling the truth .
which one are you going to pick ?
what was the first one ?
you said you were not seeing him !
i knew you' d come and fuck it up !
i was dealing with something delicate .
i' m setting up a guy who' s important to us .
he knows where the loot is and if you' il be arrested .
you lope in like rambo without a jockstrap and dangle him from a window !
now , was that smart ? !
was it shrewd ?
was it good tactics , or was it stupid ? !
don' t call me stupid .
oh , right !
to call you stupid is an insult to stupid people !
i' ve known sheep that could outwit you .
i' ve worn dresses with higher iqs .
you think you' re an intellectual , don' t you , ape ?
apes don' t read philosophy .
yes , they do .
they just don' t understand it .
let me correct you on a couple of things , ok ?
aristotle was not belgian .
the central message of buddhism
is not every man for himself .
you read ...
the london underground is not a political movement .
those are mistakes .
i looked ' em up .
now .
you have just assaulted the one man who can keep you out of jail and make you rich .
so what are you going to do about it , huh ?
what would an intellectual do ?
what would plato do ?
apologise .
pardon me ?
apolo ...
what ?
right !
i' m sorry .
no .
not to me .
to archie .
and make it good , or we' re dead .
oh , i' m so very , very , very , very s ...

i' m so very s ...
very , very s ...
very , very ... ssfff ...

i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .

i' m sorry .
i' m sorry , i didn' t know it was you .

i don' t know .
why do i like you so much ?
archie .
hm ?

i am italian !
sono italiano in spirito .
ma ho sposato una donna che preferisce lavorare in giardino a fare i' amore appassionato .
uno sbaglio grande !
but it' s such an ugly language .
