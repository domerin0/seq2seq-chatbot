under power of the state , i am hereby authorized to put you ...
lee ray oliver , to death by lethal injection .
is there anything you' d like to say ?
fuck you !
fuck every last one of you !
fuck you !
cover that up , please .
let' s get the bag open .
thank you .
where am i ?
you' re in the county morgue .
i' m not dead .
the injections you got were all saltwater except the anesthetic .
what the fuck is going on ?
you' re getting an opportunity ... to be part of a medical research project .
if you agree to participate in the experiment ...
i' il take you toe tag here put it on that body over there .
he' il be cremated , you' il go on with these gentlemen .
if you don' t agree the doctor will inject you with sodium pentathol ... and the execution will proceed right now in this room .
what kind of experiment ?
it' s a behaviour modifying drug trial .
who the fuck are you ?
i' m a neuropharmacologist .
i' m involved in the research and development of new drugs .
i like drugs !
the drug we' re going to give you ... is not a narcotic .
it won' t give you narcotic sensations .
and there may be side effects .
some severe , possibly fatal .
you want me to be a guinea pig ?
no , you' il be a test subject .
you have 1 minute to make your decision .
fuck you , warden !
proceed .
this is your last chance to do something good in your life .
a chance to give something back to society .
fuck society !
what the fuck has society ever done for me ?
doctor !
just wait !
wherever we' re going i hope it smells better that it did in there .
let' s go .
you greedy fuck !
so now you see how it goes .
every time i say fuck ... he does that !
because you , warden ... have a lot of fucking nerve !
you thought you' re gonna get another one , didn' t you ?
but i said fucking , not fuck .
please , stop !
didn' t i pay you well ... to let my men go after lee ray in prison ?
when lee ray offered him instead , did i complain ?
no .
i didn' t give a flying fuck !
i found out the state was gonna execute him .
so i am satisfied .
but now you tell me that lee ray is actually alive ... and that you will find out where he is ... if i pay you ?
i' m sorry , i' il do it for free .
it' s fair !
you' il find him , and we' il kill him .
third time' s the charm , right ?
yes , mr. vertov .
third time' s the ...
don' t fuck up !
you' il start off by taking one pill every six hours .
wait a fucking minute !
wait a minute .
what' s this pill gonna do ?
my name is dr. copeland .
i designed the medication you' il be taking .
it' s called anagress .
it works by altering the brain' s chemistry ... by suppressing your violent tendencies .
and with you aggression reduced ... you' il begin to experience feelings of good will and compassion ... a sense of right and wrong , even remorse over past mistakes .
good fucking luck .
this is the first time anagress ... has been tried on humans .
we don' t know what the side effects are .
dry mouth , dizziness , nausea ... but there is a chance they could be more severe .
like what ?
liver failure , brain seizures ... ... a stroke ...
whatever .
years ago , they might have given you a lobotomy ... carved out a piece of your brain like a rotten part of an apple .
but today we' re more civilized .
we do it biochemically .
i rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy !
how long is your little experiment gonna last ?
it' s never over .
you and the other 19 test subjects ... will be observed indefinitely .
that ' one pill every six hours .
open wide .
let' s go .
open back up .
smart man .
hey , michael !

he scored two goals in the first half .
he' s getting real tall .
they grow up so fast , don' t they ?
ah , jeez !
i just came to see how the team was doing .
we' re doing good .
it' s not the same , but ...
no .
nothing is .

the guy seems a real teddy bear .
two days and not a peep .
i want blood , urine and saliva samples .
i have a pet scan and spect scheduled .
add a cerebral spinal fluid analysis .
yes , doctor .
mr. oliver ... we' re going to remove your last restraint .
iwant you to relax .
i just died and live to talk about it .
it doesn' t get more relaxed than this .
is it all right if i smoke in here ?
we have a security breach .
i repeat , we have a security breach .

the man is a fucking animal .
he' s perfect !
hey , aiku !

you never told me your ex was so beautiful .
how long have you been here ?
not long .
i was just in the pool and i saw her drive up .
it wouldn' t be a brilliant idea for me to be toweling off in the living room .
i went upstairs and hid in your closet .
how' s your jaw ?
the truth ?
i' m gonna make you feel better .
make me forget everything .
can you do that for me ?
i can try .
what the hell is going on ?
take the pill first .
where' s my hair ?
where' s my tattoos ?
erased .
like your past .
in the next few weeks we' il be making changes on your outside ... while the medication changes you on the inside .
after what you guys did to me , you guys should be taking these pills !
ok , but you first .
attaboy .
the guy is pretty good .

barely registering .
the guy is a textbook sociopath .
is it true he stabbed an inmate in the eye with a screwdriver ?
yes .
he goes for the head .
increase game difficulty .
ok .
let' s crank it up to mach 5 .
how' d he do with his mmpl ?
just what you' d expect from ... a guy with antisocial personality disorder ... ... with psychotic tendencies .
and that' s just for starters .
your fucking thing is rigged !

nikolai vertov .
27 years old .
do you ever feel bad about taking his life ?
bad ?
i feel really bad .
you do ?

if i' d known the motherfucker was the nephew of a russian mobster ...
i never would' ve robbed him , let alone put a bullet through his head .
manoel jose gutierrez .
you ever been in prison , doc ?
let' s not get distracted .
i didn' t think so .
it' s probably not what you' re exactly used to .
the russian mobster took a contract out on me for killing his nephew .
gutierrez here tried to cash in on that contract .
i just defended myself .
you felt justified in ...
i felt fucking justified !
i don' t give a fuck if you believe me or not !
that' s what happened .
i got the jump on him , he' s dead , i' m alive .
gary david caputo .
we got a minor bump .
he' s alive .
just a little worse for wear .
tell me what happened with him .
just wrong place , wrong time .
it' s not my problem .
you threatened to kill his brother for testifying at the trial .
is that true ?
are we done ?
this is getting boring .
you were 12 years old when your mother died ?
you know exactly how old i was !
these files have discrepancies .
i just wanna make sure i get it right .
a former boyfriend killed her ... and you witnessed the murder .
is that true ?
just give me the drugs and let' s get on with it .
you never said anything about answering any of these questions !
just answer the question .
i' il answer whatever i want !
and don' t you go talking to me like that .
i' m not your kid !
if you don' t answer the question , you' re of no use to me .
i' il transfer you back to the custody of the warden right now .
you are only alive because of me .
why don' t you answer the questions , so i can help you ?
i was 1o ... not 12 .
i was 1o .
thank you .
yes , i saw her thrashing around .
i saw the whole goddamn thing .
and then the fuck who killed her took a piss in front of me .
when you got to go ... you got to go " .
you wanna hear about what my uncle john used to do with me ?
he had a little hobby that he called golf .
he used to beat me with his driver every tuesday night .
write that down .
why don' t you write a fucking book about it ?
all right , that' s enough for today .
it is e fucking nough !
i' m everything you hate in the world , huh , doc ?
he' s more at ease .
much less agitated .
five of the rhesus monkeys showed results after only three doses .
when is his next pet scan ?
" maana " .
let' s do it now .
hey , doc !
how ya doin ' ?
i' m actually doing really good !
it' s strange .
i feel ... different .
everything seems clearer , i feel less wound up .
good .
shit ... it really works .
we just got to do ...
come here !
everybody , get away !
nobody move !
back up !
i' m gonna stick this pen in his eye !

we' il take it from here .
get the fuck ... jeez ...
you' re just as fucked up as i am , doc .
you got a fancy suit ...
you' re just as fucked up as i am .
you' re just as fucked up .
get off of me !
jesus , are you okay .
increase the dosage .
8 milligrams three times a day .
that' s more than 3 times the previous .
just do it .
hart mercer pharmaceuticals ... dedicated to making the world a happier, healthier place .
now and in years ahead , we will continue our ...
you are too involved .
there' s a reason why they ... don' t want a primary researcher conducting his own clinical trial .
the man is out of control .
unsuitable .
we' il find another one .
we have to give him more time .
i' m increasing the dosage .
if you don' t like it , you can hand my resignation in to the board .
be careful .
if one threatens to resign one time too many ... they get taken up on it .
and now , ladies and gentlemen , senior v. p. of research and development ...
dr. arlo penner .
thank you .
not too long ago , the acronym ssri was virtually unheard of .
now , of course , selective seratonin reuptake inhibitors ... help millions of people lead better lives .
today , as we speak ... a new class of pharmaceuticals is being developed ... that has the potential to change society as we know it .
as you' re probably aware , the reason why hart mercer stock ... remains strong within this volatile market sector ... is largely because of dynax .
and i' m pleased to be able to announce to you that ...
dynax has once again been named ... as this year' s most prescribed anti depressant .
so , on behalf of ... the board of directors and the shareholders of hart mercer ...
i wanna thank you , dr. michael copeland ... for your groundbreaking work which continues to this day .
congratulations , doctor .
thanks .
you look surprised to see me .
maybe a little .
did you forget that i' m a shareholder ?
made us both rich .
as you keep climbing the ladder , don' t forget to count the rungs .
remember when all we wanted was that one bedroom house ?
with our very own washer and dryer .
and i was gonna open up a center ...
stop .
you' re making me feel old .
how are you ?
i' m good .
congratulations , doctor .
thanks .
barbara , this is eden ross .
she' s a post doc .
part of the team .
nice to meet you .
my pleasure .
when i was an undergrad ...
i read your paper on the educational deficits effect on family violence .
it was really brilliant .
thanks .
now i officially do feel old .
next time invent a pill for that .
bye .
nice seeing ya .
bye .
so am i gonna see you tonight ?
i hope so .
are you buying a car ?
tuesday !
must be beef stew .
i wouldn' t be too sure .
i' m sorry , lee ray .
it' s all right .
it' s cool .
no swat .
i' il get something to clean it up .
he didn' t hit me .
i could' ve made that accident ... more natural .
this is very good , gentlemen .
i did a decent yago , senior year .
who the hell is yago ?
we' ve got his mao level .
lambda k three is point one four .
this is your last chance to do something good in your life .
ok .
i' il be right there .
who was it ?
security .
i' il go with you .
come on , man , just chill .
it' s all right .
no , it' s not .
i' m gonna be sick again .
take a deep breath .
what' s going on ?
what' s going on ?
i can see his face .
whose face ?
gary caputo' s .
wrong time , wrong place .
he was just standing on the stairs with a bag of groceries .
i should' ve just ran by , passed him and just gotten the hell outta there .
it' s ok .
he was in a coma for seven months .
he had to learn to do everything all over again .
when i was in prison , i used to joke about him .
i used to brag about how i made the guy into a vegetable .
what' s important is you know that what you did is wrong .
the treatment is working .
it' s working .
why can' t i sleep ?
i wanna put my head on my pillow ... close my eyes and don' s see his face anymore .
it' s gonna be ok .
we' il give him somnubel .
5 milligrams .
brock , that' s two tablets whenever he can' t sleep .
ladies and gentlemen ... we' ve got remorse .
how can we be sure he' s not faking again ?
all of his biomarkers back it up .
ever since week 5 his serotonin and mao levels have improved ...
limbic and amygdale activity ... as well as bfs measures have responded in kind .
i think we' re ready for phase 2 .
are you sure ?
the board and i both believe that is ... absolutely your call .
but we all know the risks involved in moving forward too quickly .
it' s going to work .
i think that we' ve uncreated a monster .
lot more cell phones !
tell me about it .
this thing is tight .
you' il get used to it .
the only way that truly gauge ... the effects of anagress is to observe you in the real world .
a controlled environment can only tell us so much .
i haven' t been on the outside in a long time .
what if i fall on my ass ?
you get back up .
this is it ?
i thought you were made of money .

leave me alone .
you tell him to leave me alone .
you understand ?
i' m a different person now .
it' s over .
turn the fuck over .
you count to 5oo .
if i see a fucking eyebrow twitch , you' re dead !

ya think we weren' t gonna catch up with you ?
what the hell were you thinking ?
i needed to see gary .
to apologize .
i was coming back .
brock is okay ?
brock is unemployed .
it wasn' t his fault .
i had to go see gary .
i can' t sleep .
i had to see gary .
i was coming back .
here' s his train ticket , doc .
round trip .
you were really coming back ?
what else am i gonna go ?
you gotta give him his job back .
it wasn' t his fault !
i bet you want him back .
lf anyone figures out who you are ... if anyone knows you' re alive , the deal is off and it' s back to the warden .
you understand that , don' t you ?
can i have a pill , please ?
couldn' t be !
was this the guy who that in here ?
they showed that commercial again .
and you missed it .
the man had a return ticket , for god' s sakes !
what he did today was an act of contrition .
12 weeks ago , he had no remorse ... and now he' s risking his life to apologize !
the man is a murderer .
he was a murderer .
you put a guard in his room , it' il influence his behaviour .
you can' t do it !
if anything were happen , we' re responsible .
hart mercer pharmaceuticals !
i' il give you one more chance ... then we move on to a different test subject .
period .
end of discussion .
arlo ... is there something i should know about the other test subjects ?
i' ve told you .
any knowledge of their status ... could influence your interaction with your own subject .
yes , but i heard a rumour from one of the post docs .
some of the test subjects have died of liver failure .
if it' s true , i should know .
has your subject shown signs of liver damage ?
no , he hasn' t .
the most significant side effects are insomnia , dry mouth ... persistent feelings of guilt and remorse .
nothing here about liver complications .
you don' t need to concern yourself with the other subjects .
you have enough on you hands as it is .
you shouldn' t spend so much time listening to post docs .
especially the attractive ones .
you don' t like relish much , do you ?
trying to eat more vegetables .
so what' s cincinnati like ?
they got a baseball team .
i guess you don' t miss it much .
i just wanted to start from scratch .
me too .
it' s a beautiful thing , isn' t it ?
what' s that ?
starting from scratch .
i hear you .
ralph says you' re doing really good .
he says you caught on quick .
it' s not too much to catch on to .
you want some dessert or ...
they got a really good ice cream sandwich .
come on , i owe you !
you don' t owe me anything .
i owe you .
fairly smooth .
what are you reading ?
introduction to geology .
it' s a real page turner .
you go to school ?
community college , nights .
it' s my second semester .
keeps me busy .
i knew you had brains .
if had brains , would i be working here ?
come on !
you ever been inside ?
inside what ?
come on .
do you do this very often ?
i don' t know .
for some reason i find it to be relaxing .
it is .
for a couple of minutes ...
i feel i can think .
i guess i can see that .
only thing is , you have to haul ass before ralph sees you .
you get a thing ?
teresa ...
what are you thinking ?
guess .
jump !
did he see us ?
i almost tripped over my foot .
haven' t seen him .
he looks different now .
he doesn' t have them scars .
he was in here 2 days ago .
it' s on the receipt .
we get a lot of people in here every day .
you should check the neighborhood .
maybe he lives around here .
thanks .
hop in .
i' il give you a ride to your place .
never get attached to you lab rat .
thanks , doc .
let' s go .
thanks for the lift .
sure .
put on your belt .
check those books out ?
i stole them .
had to pop a couple librarians to make me getaway .
nice .
this is a sweet ride .
i drove one of these on the car wash .
i only drive like 1o feet but ...
you got a family , doc ?
that' s none of your business .
i was just curious .
i was just wondering if you had a family .
it' s inappropriate for you to ask me personal questions .
but it' s okay for you to know everything about me .
i see how it works .
just curious .
what ?
come on .
i wanna know .
my wife and i have split up .
and we had a son .
is he living with her ?
no , he was killed .
accident ?
was he sick or ...
murder .
he was 8 years old .
we were driving home from the park after shooting hoops ...
like we did on every saturday when i could get away from work ... and a car cut us off .
i laid on the horn , changed lanes .
he cut me off again and i lost it .
i flipped him the bird and start screaming and the next thing i know ... the guy shoots at me with a gun .
the windshield shatters .
i pull over , turn ...
tommy' s slumped over covered in blood .
it' s gonna be okay , daddy .
i' m gonna be okay .
and then he died .
i' m sorry , doc .
if that guy had been on anagress , maybe my son' d be alive today .
if i had been on anagress maybe ...
you can just drop me off here .
i' il walk the rest of the way .
thanks for the lift .
there you go .
i have a date tomorrow night .
really ?
good for you .
that' s great .
this thing around my ankle ...
it stays where it is .
come on !
what if i get lucky ?
you' re gonna have to figure out a way to keep your pants on .
come on , doc !
sorry , pal .
i can' t help you .
i' m not gonna run , i swear !
i like the way things are right now .
i' m not gonna run .
i know , i believe you but ...
i got rules to follow too .
borrow the car ?
have a good time .
thanks for the ride .
sure .
be well , joe .
they didn' t change a thing .
can you tell me what' s going on ?
what do you mean ?
i haven' t had dinner with you since ...
i can remember ... even when we were still together ...
friday' s ?
i thought it was in the off limits category .
we only came here because ...
tommy liked it so much .
what can i tell you ?
i' m jonesing for a number 3 with hickory sauce .
i' m surprised they let us back in here .
i don' t think they recognized us .
how could they forget ?
the flames almost touched the ceiling .
how could they forget ... how you tried to douse the flames with your milkshake ?
who was the genius who left his menu on a smoking toaster ?
it' s a stupid place to put a toaster !
we both panicked .
only tommy stayed calm .
just unplugged it and got the manager .
that' s the first time i' ve heard you say his name since ...
i brought the papers for the lake house .
we got a pretty good price .
it will be divided fifty fifty ... as per our very amicable divorce agreement .
right here .
i' ve cashed in my stock options .
really ?
hart mercer not seem like a good investment all of a sudden ?
no , but i' m buying an old school building downtown .
it' s a major fizer upper but my accountant says that real state ... is less risky than biotech these days , so ...
true .
i' m gonna open up that youth center i was always talking about .
at least , i' m gonna try anyway .
you' il do it .
barbara , that' s great .
i thing that' s really great .
you know that colleague you introduce me to ?
she' s very pretty .
reminds me a bit of me when i was that age .
you were prettier .
and a bit smarter .
you look nice .
whatever .
whatever .
come on .
you know this guy ?
can' t say i do , mister .
ugly son of a bitch , ain' t he ?
look closer .
he' s different now .
no scars .
he changed his face , but' s still him .
you do know him , don' t you ?
he just drove out of here with that girl .
why are you looking for him ?
do he owe you money ?
then what' d he do ?
for starters ... he shot my brother in the head .
this is really cool !
i can' t believe you' ve never been to an amusement park before .
when i was a kid , a sandbox was a big deal .
want a beer ?
no .
sure ?
i' m 1o months sober .
really ?
can' t picture you a big drinker .
drinking wasn' t really my thing .
i dated this guy , and he was a dealer .
i ended up doing speed with him ' til it got out of control .
i was down to 95 pounds by the time i hit rehab .
too much information at once , huh ?
at least you got out .
you got yourself a second chance .
i had to .
i see it like this ... keep one eye in the past and one eye in the future ... you end up cross eyed .
so i' m thinking about right now .
and right now ...
i' m happy .
i' m having fun .
me too .
i got an idea .
come on .
i still think we should go in .
give him some space .
he' s gotta come out the same way he went in .
lee ray !
you' re very aggressive out there .
it' s better than crashing real cars .
that' s true .
you wanna try the merry go round ?
i' m a merry go round freak .
really ?
sure .
doesn' t make you dizzy .
i gotta go to the bathroom .
i' il be right back .
you don' t mind i go on ...
no .
i' il be right back .
get out of the way !
you there !
stop !
did i miss anything ?
nothing much .
it was a tight race but i won by a nose .
what took you so long ?
long line .
ready ?
so ... you want me to drop you off ?
i' il walk home from you apartment .
make sure you get home safe .
what ?
wanna make sure i get home safe ?
i was gonna invite you in , anyway .
you got a nice apartment .
welcome to my palace , darling .
the maid' s quarters are downstairs .
and it' s the butler' s day off .
hope you don' t mind .
you probably wanted to stay at the park longer .
i' m sorry .
i hope i didn' t mess things up .
don' t worry about it .
can' t be a kid forever .
joe ...
i' ve trusted a lot of people in my life .
i was wondering if ...
i can trust you .
there' s something i should tell you though .
great .
i' ve heard that before .
no , it' s not that .
i' m on this medicine ... these pills ... that make you ... calm or something .
what happens when you don' t take them ?
you wouldn' t wanna know me .
whatever it is they' re doing , it' s working .
i should probably go .
what' s wrong ?
nothing .
i just wanna have something to look forward to .
right .
a guy who didn' t want to jump my bones on the first date .
i can trust you .
i had a great time tonight .
me too .
something to look forward to .
i' m gonna regret having said that .
i' il see you tomorrow ?
i thought he was gonna get lucky .
tough break .
just in time .
he' s overdue for his anagress .
shit !
there' s nowhere to park .
drive around the block we' il find another one .
got ya , motherfucker !
drop the gun !
dammit !
shit !
what' s up with this asshole ?
my god !
my god !
shit !
tell me you' re not gonna get that .
hello ?
ok .
i' il be right there .
let' s go .
no , you can' t .
why ?
it might be dangerous .
if you' re not gonna let me go with you ...
i' m not gonna stay here by myself .
he ditched it in the trash bin .
i just can' t believe that he ...
don' t you see how he played you ?
he' s a sociopath .
you should' ve known better .
those bastards can fool ... polygraph machines .
what made you think he couldn' t fool you ?
i don' t know .
he' s in a black pickup with flame decals .
make sure he doesn' t go far .
you' re authorized to terminate .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
you know the protocol .
if the subject commits a violent crime ... during phase 2 , there' s no alternative .
he' s already dead in the eyes of the law .
and that justifies us hunting him down and killing him ?
goddamn right , it does .
we' il do an autopsy and figure out what happened with the anagress .
go to the lab .
make the necessary adjustments .
you' il be back on track in no time .
come on !
get up !
right here .
you can get rid of all those scars .
you still got the same evil eyes .
so , what' d you do ?
pay off the doctor ?
the warden ?
where' d a low life like you get the money to fake an execution ?
i' m sorry about gary ...
that just wraps everything up .
right , gary ?
fuckhead here says he' s sorry .
he' s my friend .
he' s your friend , huh ?
we' re going to the movies .
you' re going to the movies together ?
is that right ?
you' re good friends ?
tell my brother what a good friend you are !
i' m sorry ...
shut up !
shut the fuck up with sorry !
i saw you snickering with that lawyer .
you didn' t have an ounce of remorse .
tell my brother what you did to him .
gary ... your friend wants to tell you exactly what he did to you .
he gave me candy .
tell him .
i didn' t tell you the truth about someone else hurting you .
i did it .
tell him what you did !
i shot you in the head .
i shot you .
i' m really sorry , gary .
shut up !
fucking sorry .
i could' ve had a life if it wasn' t for you .
instead i had to take care of my fucking brother all the time !
lf i could trade places with him ...

bill caputo shot him .
he recognized me when i went to see gary !

teresa ?

ralph called .
he said somebody came to see him .
they said you were a killer .
that your name is lee ray .
is that true ?
is it true ?
i was ...
please , don' t do this to me .
i was lee ray .
i' m a different person now .
i' m not who i was .
i can' t be who i was .
please , they' re coming after me .
don' t do this to me .
it' s the cops , isn' t it ?
no , they' re not the cops .
jesus !
if you don' t let me in , they' re gonna kill me .
teresa , please !
open up !
we' re here for joe monroe .
who ?
go !
i got here as fast as i could .
what happened ?
it' s all gone to shit .
what do you mean ?
i keep on asking myself ... am i arrogant or i was just stupid ?
i had such hopes for anagress ...
i need my pills .
now !
what' s going on ?
everything is gonna be fine .
it' s not gonna be fine until i get my pill .
you got them ?
get them !
not until she leaves .
she' s not going anywhere .
i know you didn' t kill norton .
that was bill caputo' s truck , just like you said .
and i know what kind of person you are .
and you gonna let her go ' cause she has nothing to do with this .
barbara , go .
do not call the police or i' il be in trouble .
just go .
it' s gonna be fine , joe .
i want everything back the way it was .
please , give me my pills .
the pills are in my office .
this isn' t enough .
what am i supposed to do when this runs out ?
eden ross .
hi, it' s me .
i need you to do something for me .
now you need my help ?
please , this is important .
take all the anagress we have and bring it to my house .
can you do that ?
okay .
and don' t tell anyone .
was that him ?
what' d he want ?
he wants me to bring the lab supply of anagress to his house .
well done .
it' s my job .
she' il be here in half an hour .
thanks .
what' s happening ?
did you hear anything ?
where is he ?
what ?
eden said you asked her to bring anagress to your house .
i tried to warn you .
post docs , they always put their careers first .
where is he ?
i don' t know .
he called one hour ago ... but wouldn' t say where he was .
just wanted his pills .
he didn' t kill norton .
bill caputo did .
it was bill caputo' s truck they saw driving away .
joe monroe doesn' t have to die .
the anagress works .
all we have to do is get him back on the medication .
anagress doesn' t work .
anagress does work .
doesn' t work !
all the subjects who took anagress are dead .
their livers shut down after six weeks .
he' s fine .
he was on a placebo .
he was part of the control group .
he was getting nothing but sugar pills .
if he was taking the actual medicine , he' d be dead right now .
but ... that' s not possible .
you knew there was a chance he' d be in the control group .
yes , but his biomarkers , his seratonin levels ... scientifically ...
never underestimate the power of the placebo effect .
people have cured themselves from every disease known to science .
eradicated tumors , for chrissakes !
but eventually the placebo effect dies .
i need a drink .
anybody want a drink ?
hello ?
michael , is he still in the house ?
no , he' s outside .
he crapped all over the floor .
i think he' s got worms .
i' m keeping him outside .
does he still have a gun ?
no, but the vet should check him out .
he' il be ready when you get here .
i' m calling the police .
i got to go now .
i' m expecting a work call .
ok .
bye .
that was barbara .
i call her whenever the dog is sick .
you know how she is .
are you still seeing her ?
i always liked barbara .
no , we just share custody of the dog .
you sure you don' t want a drink ?
' cause i need one .
maybe i' il have a drink .
shit !
you can get yourself killed for doing this .
nobody is gonna get killed .
gonna get you to the airport .
put you on the next flight out .
i don' t have enough pills .
you don' t need any pills .
what are you talking about ?
you don' t need them .
they were nothing but sugar .
what ?
they didn' t do a damn thing .
son of a bitch !
the placebo .
you were in the control group .
that' s bullshit !
no .
i never lied to you and i' m not lying to you now .
he' s headed forthe lake .
we got him .
you know what to do .
you knew this the whole time ?
it would' ve affected how i treated you .
i just found out tonight , i swear .
you knew theses things weren' t real ?
they were real to you , and that' s what matters .
you okay ?
you gotta get outta here .
get to the airport anyway you can .
here' s some money .
disappear .
go .
that was you , doc .
what ?
you' re the reason why i got better .
it wasn' t any drug .
you changed yourself .
now hurry !
go !
go !
you gotta go .
what do you think of it so far ?
it' s okay .
let' s have a look outside .
beautiful !
wayne , this is michael .
how you doing , wayne ?
good .
you wanna meet the other guys ?
come on .
all right , rhonda , time to play a real master .
i want you to meet wayne !
