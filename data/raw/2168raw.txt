it' s the darn men .
they run into her just to start a conversation .
will you come up , lz ?

it' s brand new .
it was a divorce present from her husband .

why not ?
on the anniversary of our divorce , my husband always sends me ... .. one potted yellow rose , and it' il be 19 years in july .
course , he never did pay me the alimony .
but i wouldn' t wanna put a man out , you know , if his heart' s not in it .
you break your arm in the car ?
no .
my last roomer , the one before mrs taber , we celebrated her divorce and ... .. l misbehaved .
i' m so sick and tired of myself .
will you go over my answers again ?
sure , dear .
but don' t worry , you' il do wonderfully .
let' s see .
did your husband , mr raymond taber , ... .. act toward you with cruelty ?
darlin ' ?
well , yes .
just say yes .
yes .
ln what way did this cruelty manifest itself ?
he persistently ...
how does that go again ?
he persistently and cruelly ignored my personal wishes and my rights , ... .. and resorted on several occasions to physical violence against me .
he persistently ...
oh , do i have to say that ?
why can' t i just say he wasn' t there ?
he ...
you could touch him , but he wasn' t there .
lf that was grounds for divorce , ... .. there' d only be about 1 1 marriages left in the us .
now just repeat after me .
" he persistently ...
he persistently ...
they' il call in their estimate , ma' am .
those dents aren' t my fault , you know .
i' il recommend the best price i can , ma' am .
you can drive her now .
i' ve put in a new battery .
i' il never drive that car again .

beautiful country around here , you know .
well , i don' t know where i' il be , but ok .
thanks again .
my name is lsabelle steers .
lsabelle .
well , ok , you come along too .
that' s a sweet afterthought !
you reno men !
i can' t memorise this .
it' s not the way it was .
just say it .
it doesn' t have to be true .
this isn' t a quiz show , it' s only a court .
i just got off the plane ...
i don' t wanna hear anything .
just give me five minutes .
after two years , five minutes ...
you can' t have me now , so you want me , that' s all .
please , i' m not blaming you .
it' s ...
i just don' t believe in the whole thing any more .
kid , i understand .
i understand ...
you don' t understand .
you' re not there , raymond .
lf i' m gonna be alone , i wanna be by myself .
go back .
you' re not gonna make me feel sorry for you any more .
gay !
wait up !
i was just goin ' over to see ya !
well , good luck now , susan .
i won' t forget you , you can be sure of that .
i don' t even know where to write you .
general delivery .
i' il get it .
will you think about it ?
it' s the second largest laundry in st louis .
i wouldn' t wanna kid you .
i ain' t cut out for business .
well , will you think of me ?
oh , gay ...
oh , you know i will , honey .
goodbye .
bye .
how' re you doin ' , boy ?

cos i am .
well , i' ve been thinkin ' about it .
which one was that ?
susan .
swell sport , that woman .
i just met me a girl sweet enough to eat , gay .
fine lookin ' woman .
but when i think of all the useless talkin ' you gotta do , i get discouraged .
i tell you , i' m dyin ' for some fresh air .
and no people , male or female .
why don' t we take out to the mountains ?
we could even do a little mustangin ' .
i wanted to pile up about 500 this time .
i need a new engine .
that engine' il fly you anywhere .
say , you' ve been two months on this job .
you' il get the habit .
i' il see you over at harrah' s later .
let' s talk about it .
tom dooley .
lf you throw in your ring you' il never get another divorce .
go ahead , honey .
everybody does it .
more gold in that river than there is in the klondike .
did you do that ?
who , me ?
no .
i lost my ring on my honeymoon .
let' s get a drink .
that' s my girl .
wait a minute , honey .
this machine loves me .
never say die .
scotch , i guess , on i ...
yeah , on ice .
rye and water .
scotch on ice , rye and water .
well , cheer up .
i will .
i just hate to fight with anybody .
when you win , you lose .
you know , in your heart .
well , you' re free .
maybe the trouble is you' re not used to it yet .
no , the trouble is i always end up back where i started .
never had anybody much .
and here i am .
well , you had your mother , didn' t you ?
how do you have somebody who disappears all the time ?
they both weren' t there .
she' d go off with a patient for three months and ...
you know how long three months is to a kid .
listen , don' t leave .
settle here .
they got a school .
you could teach dancing .
one thing about this town , it' s always full of interesting strangers .
oh , i' m sorry .
what did i say ?
i ...
i suddenly miss my mother .
oh , isn' t that the stupidest thing ?
lz , you' re a fine woman .
practically the only woman that' s ever been my friend .
well , drink up then .
oh , isn' t that the dearest dog ?
look how sweet he sits there .
yeah .
dogs are nice .
here .
puppy .
hey , dooley .
hello .
how' d you make out ?
ok .
i' d like you to meet a friend of mine .
gay ...
gay langland , mrs taber .
howdy do ?
and this is mrs , uh ... ?
steers . lsabelle steers .
one thing about reno men , they do remember the name .
why don' t you boys sit down ?
thank you .
what' re you girls drinkin ' ?
whiskey .
we' re celebratin ' the jail burned down .
mary , see if you can get four doubles , will you ?
uh ... you sure made a big impression on my friend here .
and i can see why .
you a mechanic too ?
him ?
he' s a cowboy .
how' d you know ?
i can smell , can' t l ?
hey , you can' t smell cows on me .
i smell the look on your face , cowboy .
but i love every miserable one of ya .
course , you' re all good for nothin ' , as you know .
that may be .
but it' s better than wages .
i suppose you' il be headin ' back east soon , mrs taber ?
i can' t make up my mind .
i don' t know yet what to do .
you don' t have a business to run , or a school to teach , or ... ?
me ?
i never finished high school .
well !
that' s real good news .
you don' t like educated women ?
they' re all right .
always wantin ' to know what you' re thinkin ' , that' s all .
maybe they want to get to know you .
did you ever get to know a man better by askin ' him questions ?
you mean he' d lie ?
well , he might not .
and then again , he just might .
how about it , pilot ?
we takin ' off today ?
you ever been outside reno , mrs taber ?
i walked to the edge of town .
doesn' t look like much is out there .
everything' s there .
like what ?
the country .
well , what do you do with yourself ?
just live .
how do you just live ?
well , you start by goin ' to sleep .
you get up when you feel like it .
you scratch yourself .
you fry some eggs .
you see what kind of a day it is .
you throw stones at a can and whistle .
i know what you mean .
i have an empty house in the country just beyond hawleyville .
it' s all yours if you want some peace and quiet before you go back .
the last woman' s gone ?
no kiddin ' .
i never offered it before .
well , i wouldn' t stay there .
but let' s rent a car .
we could look at the country .
gay has a truck .
you can have my car .
then you' il have to drive me back .
i don' t mind .
thanks , but i like to feel i' m on my own .
i' il rent a car .
where can l ?
right now ?
why not ?
ok .
you sure don' t waste time , do you ?
i just gotta stop by the garage and quit .
hey , now , that' s the boy .
no , gay .
this is mine .
mm .
what is that beautiful smell ?
smells like green perfume .
that' s sage , darlin ' .
oh , sure !
i never smelled it except in bottles .
gee , it' s beautiful here .
look , dear girl , i think i better tell you somethin ' about cowboys .
you really worry about me , don' t you ?
well , you' re too believin ' .
cowboys are the last real men left , ... .. and they' re about as reliable as jack rabbits .
ls anybody any different ?
maybe you' re not supposed to believe people .
maybe it' s not even fair to them .
i couldn' t hear what he said to her , but it looked like she left him .
the husband .
she' s kinda hard to figure out , you know ?
one minute she looks kinda dumb and brand new , like a kid , ... .. and the next minute ...
she sure moves , though , don' t she ?
mm .
she' s real prime .
it isn' t finished yet .
it' s weathertight .
come on in .
it' s insulated .
flush doors .
this is the living room .
and this was gonna be another bedroom .
it' s even nicer this way .
here' s a picture window .
take a look at this view .
take a look at that .
gee .
it goes on for ever .
fireplace .
brick .
this is the kitchen .
gas refrigerator .
it' s nice .
and here' s the bathroom .
ceramic tile .
here' s our ...
this was our bedroom .
my wife .
she died here .
i' m ... sorry .
she was due to have a baby .
i was up setting the capstone on the chimney ... .. and she screamed ... .. and that was that .
couldn' t you call a doctor ?
she didn' t seem to be that sick .
then i got a flat .
i didn' t have a spare .
everything just happened wrong .
it' il do that sometimes .
yeah , i know .
uh , you couldn' t live here any more , huh ?
we knew each other since we were seven years old , see ?
you ought to find yourself another girl .
i don' t know .
me with anybody else , it seems impossible , you know ?
she wasn' t like any other women .
stood behind me 100 per cent , uncomplaining as a tree .
maybe that' s what killed her .
i mean , a little complaining helps sometimes maybe .
hey , lz , isn' t this a beautiful place here ?
yeah .
it' d be just perfect if somebody' d bring in that bottle of whiskey i bought .
with my own money .
hey , that' s right !
and bring that bag of groceries .
maybe somebody wants a sandwich .
the glasses are in the kitchen , lsabelle .
i' m real tired .
no , you' re just a cowboy , darlin ' .
you fellas won' t move unless it' s rainin ' down your necks .
too rough for you , roslyn ?
i don' t mind that .
you should' ve seen his wife .
she helped pour cement and knocked in nails .
she was a real good sport .
now she' s dead because he didn' t have a spare tyre .
well , that' s the way it goes .
it goes the other way too , though .
don' t forget that .
it' s sure nice to see people in here .
come on , let' s have a drink .
i' il start the fridge .
it makes ice quick .
lce ?
we gonna stay that long , roslyn ?
i don' t know .
oh , sure .
come on .
there' s no better place to be .
and you couldn' t find better company , either .
all right .
that' s it , sport .
turn on that ice , guido .
let' s get this stuff a flowin ' , make the desert bloom .
well , flow it slow .
we only got one bottle .
there .
put that in your thoughts and see how they come out .
come on , sit down , everybody .
let' s get comfortable .
i' m sure glad you like this place .
here' s to nevada , the " leave it " state .
the what state ?
the " leave it " state .
you got money to gamble , leave it here .
a wife you wanna get rid of , get rid of her here .
extra atom bomb you don' t need , blow it up here .
nobody will mind in the slightest .
the slogan of nevada is " anything goes , but don' t complain if it went .
that' s no lie .
i even left my southern accent here .
how come you never went back home ?
you came here for a divorce , didn' t you ?
i wasn' t beautiful enough to go back .
oh , lsabelle .
no , that' s true .
beauty' s a help any place , but in virginia it' s a necessity .
why , you can' t hardly get a driver' s licence without it .
no , i love nevada .
you know , they don' t even have regular meal times here .
never met so many people didn' t own a watch .
might have two wives at the same time , but no watch .
bless them all .
how quiet it is here .
sweetest sound there is .
there' s an lndian store about five miles , if you wanna shop .
groceries , everything .
lf you wanna stay , that is .
be glad to come by and do your chores , if you like .
you know , he reminds me of that cowboy friend i told you about .
had one arm gone , but he was more man with one arm ... .. than any other man is with two .
oh ?
i mean like cookin ' .
oh !
no , i' m serious .
he could take a panful of chops , toss ' em , ... .. and they all came down on the other side .
who is he ?
maybe they know him .
darlin ' , you can' t go lookin ' for a man .
what , did he take off ?
no , not exactly .
he just never came back .
andy powell .
you ever ... ?
sure !
called andy gump sometimes ?
that' s him .
you know where he is ?
saw him at the rodeo only last month .
maybe we could find him .
stop thinkin ' you can change things .
but if there' s something you can do ...
i don' t know what to do , but if i knew , i' d do it .
have you got a radio or a phonograph ?
maybe we' il have some music .
there' s no electricity .
the car radio .
now who' d have thought of that ?
you always get an idea , don' t you ?
i' il go bring the car round .
say , how about another drink to keep that first one warm ?
i' d love it .
i' m gonna make myself a sandwich .
how about you folks ?
ok .
i hope you' re gonna stay on here .
any chance ?
why ?
what difference would it make ?
might make all the difference in the world as time goes by .
like to dance ?
ok .
thanks . lz , give him another drink .
it' s a wonderful house , guido .
hey , that' s pretty good dancin ' , cowboy .
what are you doin ' ?
she used to teach dancin ' .
you know ?
before she was married .
no kiddin ' ? ln a dance hall ?
uh huh .
how about the landlord ?
move over , boy , huh ?
watch out for those pretty little feet .
she knows how to get out of the way .
let' s go .
where' d you learn that , pilot ?
i never knew him to dance at all .
look at old pilot comin ' out from under a bushel !
hey , you two ought to put on a show !
come on , honey .
this is a good one .
i haven' t danced like this in years .
didn' t your wife dance ?
not like you .
she had no gracefulness .
why didn' t you teach her to be graceful ?
you can' t learn that .
how do you know ?
i mean , how do you know ?
you see , she died , and she didn' t know how you can dance .
to a certain extent , maybe you were strangers .
i don' t feel like discussing my wife .
don' t be mad .
i only meant that if you loved her you could' ve taught her anything .
because ... we' re all dying , aren' t we ?
all the husbands and all the wives .
every minute .
and we' re not teaching each other what we really know , are we ?
dum da da ... dum ...
guido , you' re a nice man .
smile .
come on .
come on , lz .
i' m lookin ' for your shoes , dear girl .
watch out .
there' s no step !
we better get you home , girl .
you were worried about me .
how sweet .
just wanna keep you all in one pretty piece .
would you have had a spare tyre ?
somebody' d better drive her .
go ahead .
i' il take the truck .
oh , lz , don' t leave poor guido alone .
tom dooley !
you' re a real beautiful woman .
it' s almost kind of an honour sittin ' next to you .
you just shine in my eyes .
that' s my true feelin ' , roslyn .
what makes you so sad ?
i think you' re the saddest girl i ever met .
you' re the first man that ever said that .
i' m usually told how happy i am .
that' s because you make a man feel happy .
i don' t feel that way about you , gay .
well , don' t get discouraged , girl .
you might .
look , why don' t you try it out here for a while , see what happens ?
you know , sometimes when a person don' t know what to do , ... .. the best thing is to just stand still .
i' il guarantee you' il have something out here you wouldn' t find on every corner .
i , uh ...
i may not amount to much in some ways , but i am a good friend .
thanks .
let me take you back and get your things .
try it for a while , see what happens .
ever hear the story about the city man out in the country ?
he sees this fella sittin ' on his porch , so he says " mister , ... .. could you tell me how i can get back to town ? " the fella says " no .
well , could you tell me how to get to the post office ? " the fella says " no .
well , do you know how to get to the railroad station ? " " no .
boy , " he says , " you sure don' t know much , do you ?
the fella says " nope .
but i ain' t lost .
don' t you have a home ?
sure .
never was a better one , either .
where is it ?
right here .
come on .
i got a surprise for you .
you cooked breakfast .
here , let me .
no , no , no .
you sit down and enjoy yourself .
just this once .
you do this often ?
uh uh .
first time for me .
really and truly ?
mm hm .
mm .
smells delicious .
hey , you really go all out , don' t you ?
even the way you eat .
i like that .
women generally pick .
you like me , huh ?
birds must be brave to live out here .
at night especially .
whereas they' re so small , you know ?
mm hm .
you think i' m crazy .
i look that way cos i can' t make you out .
why ?
i don' t know .
you got children ?
i never wanted children with him .
oh .
children are supposed to bring you together .
but what if they don' t ?
i' ve known of so called happily married couples .
one time , the wife was in the hospital to have the baby ... .. and the husband was calling me up .
i mean , he was calling me .
they' re still supposed to be happily married .
i guess you believe in true love , don' t you ?
i don' t know , but they ought to invent a way that you don' t have children ... .. unless you care for each other , cos kids know the difference .
i always knew the difference .
listen , if you wanna go somewhere , i don' t mind being alone .
do i look like i wanna leave ?
i just want you to do what you feel like .
you ain' t kiddin ' .
even when you' re kiddin ' , you ain' t kiddin ' .
no .
it makes me feel peaceful .
you know , they come out here from new york , chicago , st louis , ... .. and find them a cowboy .
cowboys are supposed to be dumb , you know .
so they tell ' em everything .
and they do everything .
everything they couldn' t do back home .
it' s pitiful .
why is it pitiful ?
cowboy' s laughin ' at ' em , and they don' t even know it .
it' s nice to meet someone who has respect for a man .
did you ever think of getting married again ?
yeah .
i' ve thought about it a lot of times .
but never in daylight .
you get lonesome for your children ?
oh , i see ' em now and then .
they come whenever i' m in a rodeo .
i' m a pretty good roper .
i get lonesome , sure .
my daughter is almost your size .
uh ...
you size 1 2 ?
uh huh .
yeah .
so is she .
i bought her a dress for christmas .
size 1 2 .
what happened ?
did you just stop loving your wife , gay ?
well , i come home one night and she' s all wrapped up in a car with a fella .
turned out to be an old friend .
a cousin of mine , as a matter of fact .
oh .
you never had any idea , huh ?
no .
you know , in those days i thought you got married and that was it .
but nothin ' is it .
not for ever .
that' s what i can' t get used to .
everything keeps changing .
i' il tell you this , though .
i wouldn' t know how to say goodbye to you , roslyn .
it surprises me .
there' s a lot to be done around this place .
lf we were gonna stay awhile .
let' s go out in the sunshine .
come on .
let' s just live like you said in the bar .
i don' t know where i am yet .
hey !
couldn' t we use that for a step ?
well , we just might at that .
there you are .
let me try it .
it' s perfect .
i can go in ... and i can come out .
go in ... and i can come out .
go in ... .. and i can come out .
i can go in ... .. and i can come out .
guido !
what' s he doing ?
might land .
there' s a place back there .
nah .
i guess he' s just sayin ' hello .
here , have some lemonade .
oh , thanks .
what does he do ?
just fly around ?
could be goin ' for eagles .
now and again ranchers hire guido to shoot eagles .
why ?
well , they kill a lot of lambs .
he gets $50 a bird .
i never really saw anything grow before .
how tiny those seeds were .
and yet they know they' re supposed to be lettuces .
you say the darnedest things .
you know that , don' t you ?
everybody' s busy in chicago , and here we are .
i love this whole state !
hey ...
what have we here now ?
well ...
just plain old rabbit !
i' m gonna get him .
it' s just one lettuce .
maybe he won' t do it any more .
no , ma' am !
it' s them or us !
there won' t be a thing left inside of a week .
couldn' t you wait and see ?
i can' t stand to see anything killed .
honey , it' s only a rabbit .
but it doesn' t know any better , does it ?
go on inside and let me handle this .
i know you worked hard ...
you' re darn right !
and i didn' t do it for some bug eyed rabbit .
gay , please .
honey , will you go on inside now ?
and stop bein ' silly ?
i' m not being silly .
you don' t respect what i feel .
and i don' t care about the lettuce !
i care about it !
and how about havin ' some respect for me ?
oh , guido and lsabelle !
guido !
dear girl !
i thought i saw a passenger !
we never heard you land .
my , you look thrivin ' .
boy , am i in the right place ?
seen the vegetable garden ?
took gay a week just to turn the soil .
mowed the grass and put in them flowers too .
i got your windows unstuck .
fireplace don' t smoke now .
you must be a magician .
all he ever did for a woman was get out the ice cubes .
look , we have chairs .
come and sit .
let' s show him the inside .
you know , i' ve moved this furniture so many times , i' m gettin ' long ears !
my , you look lovely .
you' ve really found yourself , haven' t you ?
well , i ...
oh , it' s so nice to see you , lsabelle .
look , we have a step .
how' s your arm ?
well , it' s still as weak as a bird' s wing .
well , i never saw anything like it in my life .
it' s magical .
just hope you realise you finally made contact with a real woman .
my dear girl !
come , guido .
i wanna show you the rest .
i' ve changed a few things , though .
we' ve changed things around .
how do you like it ?
oh , don' t look at those .
gay just hung ' em up for a joke .
i put your picture up in the living room .
come on , let' s have lots of drinks .
come on .
oh , it' s so nice to have company .
i put your picture there . ls that all right ?
you don' t have to keep it out .
why , guido , it' s part of the house .
besides , it' s your house .
oh , sit in the big chair .
this must' ve been your chair .
matter of fact , it was .
lsabelle .
put this under your arm .
thanks , dear girl .
i used to do all my studyin ' in this chair .
when i was still ambitious .
what did you study ?
i was on my way to bein ' a doctor .
before the war .
well , you never can tell .
maybe you' il get ambitious again .
i' m gonna tell you somethin ' , roslyn .
i spent four years in the war .
did two tours , flew 50 missions .
every time i came back to base i started to design this house .
but somehow i could never get it to look like my idea of it .
now it almost does .
you just walk in , a stranger out of nowhere , ... .. and for the first time it all lights up .
and i' m sure you know why too .
why ?
because you have the gift for life .
the rest of us , we' re just lookin ' for a place to hide and watch it all go by .
amen .
here' s to your life , roslyn .
i hope it goes on for ever .
and yours .
and yours , lsabelle .
and gay .
gay did all the work , you know .
yeah .
and the rabbits are sure enjoyin ' it too .
can you break away from this paradise long enough to do a little mustangin ' ?
mustangin ' ?
now you' re sayin ' somethin ' .
you been up in the mountains ?
took a quick look earlier this mornin ' .
i spotted 1 5 horses .
that' s not too bad .
boy , i' d sure like to get my hands on a rope again .
what do you say ?
i will never understand cowboys .
all crazy about animals , and the minute they got nothin ' else to do , ... .. they run up in the mountains and bother those poor wild horses .
shame on you !
horses ?
sure .
nevada mustang .
used to ship ' em all over the united states .
not many left .
we' d have to pick up another man .
dayton rodeo' s on today .
we ought to be able to pick up a fella there .
that' s an idea .
hey , you never saw a rodeo .
oh , you gotta see a rodeo !
i' d love to .
will you come too ?
i' m all set .
i' il get dressed up .
let' s have some fun !
that' s a girl .
