she' s cajun .
i told her that you wanted the st. nicholas candle .
right ?
is that what you wanted ?
yeah , that' s the one i was pointing to .
now , what happened right there ?
what did she say ?
she said you' re a nice looking boy , but she doesn' t trust you .
she didn' t say that , did she ?
you know what it is ?
jury duty .
got a summons in the mail .
just trying to pray my way out of it .
where' s your sense of civic duty ?
um , i flunked civics .
oh .
do you have any other tips ?
i would go with the st. catherine candle .
what did she do ?
she' s the patron saint of unmarried women and ... jurors .
really ?
really .
that' s not what that candle really is , is it ?
this your first time in new orleans ?
no , no .
i' ve been here a number of times .
hm .
i had you pegged as a first timer .
is that right ?
yeah .
how' s your mother ?
excuse me ?
is she feeling better ?
how do you know about my mother ?
she was in the hospital , but now you' re taking care of her at home .
she had a stroke .
your wife wants you to put her in a home , but you' re feeling guilty about that .
you' ve checked out a few of them , and it doesn' t feel like the christian thing to do .
reconsider the home .
better an unhappy mother than an unfriendly wife .
i' m up here on the right .
the same thing with guns and vicksburg firearms .
the only thing that' s gonna win the case for us is because for the first time , we got a gun company ex executive who' s gonna go up against his former employer and , with good conscience , he' s gonna testify for us .
i promised celeste that i would win it for her and all the other victims that died that day .
you' re gonna make history , celeste .
we' re gonna make history together .
thank you for your courage .
barry , we got the strickland suv case at noon , and , celeste , i' m gonna see you and your son at arnaud' s at six ...
just as long as we don' t talk about ...
nothing about the case .
this is dinner with you and henry .
barry , you got time to see her to her car ?
absolutely .
thank you .
mr. rohr .
yeah ?
lawrence green .
lindus hostetler .
ah , hostetler .
we ...
yeah .
yes , jury consultants , new york city .
philadelphia .
i wanna thank you for agreeing to meet with me , sir .
thank you .
i just want you to guess how many phone calls and letters
i get from expert jury consultants such as yourself .
i can imagine , sir .
go on , take a guess .
well , i appreciate that you invited me down here , sir .
well , this is more important now .
which one ?
i' m sorry ?
well , i' m off to court .
this is the striped , non striped .
striped , non striped .
go ...
i would go with the striped one , sir .
it matches your jacket .
and you have a striped one because you' re from new york city .
philadelphia , sir .
i think we' re gonna go with the non striped one , phyilis .
you know , as a clever jury consultant , you should know that jurors down here don' t trust a lawyer
who' s too nattily turned out .
huh ?
it' s ...
how familiar are you with my case ?
very , sir .
you think it' s a strong case ?
yes , sir .
ooh .
do you think it' s a winning case ?
people don' t win gun cases , mr. rohr .
i think i can help you with that , sir .
there' s gotta be another commuter flight .
have you tried one in richmond or atlanta ?
i gotta call you back .
he' s here .
you represent the widow of a man shot by a vicksburg firearms gun .
that gun company' s finding out things about prospective jurors their husbands and their wives don' t even know .
is that right ?
yeah .
and the word is , the defense has retained rankin fitch as their lead jury consultant .
rankin fitch ?
you don' t ...
no , i know who he is .
mr. fitch , how was your flight ?
fine .
are we up and running , miss monroe ?
we are .
kaufman' s inside with birk and the kid from mlt , lamb , he' s here , too .
what about broussard , forensic ...
linguistics out of rochester .
he missed his connecting flight in atlanta , but he' il be here by three .
who' s our backup ?
sir , he' il be here by three .
who is our backup ?
levon raines , out of dallas .
all right .
call mr. broussard .
tell him his service is no longer required .
see what time raines can be here .
yes , sir .
mr. fitch .
i just want you to tell me why i need a jury consultant .
fitch' s team will be scientifically picking jurors predisposed in his favor by using video surveillance , wiretaps , psych profiles , graphology ...
barry , where' s my car ?
it' s where you parked it .
all right , come on .
we' re going together .
sir , i have a master' s in psychology from the university of chicago .
i know handwriting analysis .
i know this stuff .
i really do .
plus civics , ok ?
delores kinnerly , registered democrat , 46 years of age , unmarried , occupational therapist .
devout cat lover .
yeah , look at the way she turns away from the man walking his dog .
she' s definitely self conscious about her weight .
maybe she just hates dogs .
good morning .
morning .
freeze that , mr. lamb .
we love fat women , people .
they' re tight fisted , unsympathetic .
i want her on my jury .
ladies and gentlemen , let' s find 11 more jurors and three alternates just like her .
who' s next ?
jerry fernandez , 40 years old .
puerto rican .
works for a local moving company ...
i got 35 years of experience in courtrooms , and my instincts for picking jurors has served me quite nicely so far .
i wanna thank you for your time .
mr. rohr , i flew down here on my own dime .
why ?
because i ...
i ...
because i believe in ...
i believe in this case !
why ?
i ...
i believe in a world without guns .
that' s very sweet , but a little naive .
30 percent .
i' m sorry .
excuse me ?
30 percent of your usual fee , you' re hired , strictly probationary status .
you don' t wanna check out my rsum ...
already did .
it' s impressive .
ok , here' s the thing .
what' ve you got ?
the following are automatically exempt ...
i read through that stuff .
" not a resident of new orleans parish .
that' s not gonna work .
what am i gonna say ?
we have to be thorough .
russell , i' m gonna tell these people
i' m just gonna pack up and leave ?
number two ...
what do you mean , pack up and leave ?
i' ve seen your stuff .
you ain' t got nothing to pack .
no , it' s true .
they own you .
but i' il tell you this .
leave the country .
why am i gonna leave the country ?
uh , church convention .
sex change .
you' re leaving because you' re becoming a woman .
yeah .
you got a goat farm ...
this whole thing is a disaster because i got my life , i got my work and i got my training .
the challenge .
the challenge .
ooh !
ooh !
you can claim hardship .
that' s eight weeks away ...
eight weeks and you' re gone .
i can' t do it .
and you can' t do it .
you' ve got the challenge .
you can' t go .
all right , all right .
check this .
if you have been convicted of a felony ...
have you been convicted of a felony ?
no .
you should commit a felony .
just commit a crime .
are you serious ?
it doesn' t have to be a bad crime .
you' re out .
you' re gone .
i should commit a crime ?
you' re asking to get out of it , are you not ?
you registered to vote .
that' s the problem .
if you register to vote , then they got you in that jury pool .
we need to de register him .
you know , one of these days , i' m gonna get organized , throw half this stuff away .
oh , what' s that ?
a walther ppk .
that' s a nice piece .
that' s the same gun james bond uses .
you know that ?
really ?
can' t be too safe these days .
walking on the streets all alone .
smooth , maxine .
tell you what .
it' s easier to find an honest firearm these days than a good man .
ouch !
you know how to use it ?
oh , my brother took me out to the dump one time .
mm hm .
you should let me take you down to a firing range , really .
attaboy .
attaboy .
yeah , i' il show you how to shoot .
i got a few ideas .
i bet .
nice job , maxine .
way to go .
frank herrera , cuban , 43 years old .
retired marine sergeant .
served tours in panama and grenada .
twice divorced .
now he makes his living cleaning swimming pools .
fair to say that he misses his former position of authority .
i think frank would make an excellent jury foreman , don' t you , mr. cable ?
well , i' m only lead counsel for the defense , mr. fitch .
i don' t pretend to know very much about jury selection .
really ?
really .
who' s next ?
next is nicholas easter .
34 , co manager of game trader in the esplanade mall .
who' s it for ?
oh , he' s gonna love this .
yeah .
now watch me hit this lady in the head .
see how her head explodes ?
it completely explodes !
you' re not supposed to hit her .
you know , you hit the bad guys .
i can try ?
give it a shot , yeah .
ok .
show me how to hold it .
here you go .
thank you .
i threw in this little , um , sniper game .
i thought he might like it .
uh , i wrote down my phone number .
oh , ok .
so that' s a local number .
you' re here .
yeah , we' re close .
perfect .
right on .
i' m maxine .
i' m nick easter .
he calls himself a part time student .
uh , tulane ?
city college ?
currently nowhere .
so he' s iying .
where' s he from ?
moved here eight months ago .
trail' s cold .
just dropped out of the sky like the archangel gabriel , huh ?
you put him on a jury with sergeant herrera , he' s gonna be doing dog tricks inside five minutes .
look , without reviewing his questionnaire , without a formal q and a , i don' t think i can trust this .
well , you' re only lead counsel for the defense , mr. cable .
you shouldn' t pretend to know very much about jury selection .
nicholas easter , he' s an entertainer .
wants to make everybody happy .
not a bad way to go through life , making everybody happy .
but in court , it' s not that simple .
somebody always loses .
just not me .
he' s a risk .
let' s move on .
the case stems from the shooting death of new orleans stockbroker jacob wood two years ago .
seating a panel won' t be easy in this highly watched , politically charged trial that begins with jury selection today .
on the defense , vicksburg firearms .
attorneys will begin questioning potential jurors today ...
the gun industry has never lost in the courts , but this time , the man leading this fight , attorney wendall rohr , says it' il be different .
he says this time , the gun industry will pay .
it' s not sticking .
i need the other tape .
ah , for pity' s sake .
you know what you' re doing ?
you' re good to go .
could i get your glasses , big guy ?
perfect .
same prescription .
the frames , however , will feel a little bit heavier .
put ' em on .
right side of the table .
keep it square .
keep it clear .
mr. cable .
i' m gonna be putting this behind your right ear .
what is it ?
well , it ain' t dramamine .
right there .
all set .
you' re done ?
i am .
mr. rohr .
can you smell that ?
200 year old mahogany .
furniture polish , cheap cologne and body odor .
wendall .
how you doin ' ?
i' m nick .
lydia .
so , what are we supposed to do ?
are we supposed to sit here all day ?
is that it ?
what do they want us to do ?
i' m sure we can think of something .
all rise !
oyez , oyez , oyez , civil district court for the parish of orleans is now in session .
the honorable frederick buford harkin presiding .
god save this state and this honorable court .
thank you , bailiff .
you may take your seats .
this suit is brought by the plaintiff celeste wood ...
over your left shoulder .
rankin fitch , 2 : 00 .
dark suit .
you' ve heard the myth .
now meet the man .
i' m quaking in my florsheims . ... used to kill jacob wood .
celeste wood claims that vicksburg firearms is liable for her husband' s wrongful death and seeks special damages for loss of mr. wood' s future earnings , as well as general damages , including pain and suffering .
plaintiff has exercised her right to a jury trial .
ladies and gentlemen , we are now ready to begin the voir dire .
miss coleman .
mrs.
mrs. coleman .
excuse me .
i see from your questionnaire that you have no particular feeling about guns one way or another .
briefcase on the jury .
would you say that' s correct ?
yes , sir , that' s correct .
i don' t feel one way or another about guns , but i sure hate to see people get hurt , though .
i understand .
do you or your husband own a gun ?
we do not .
ever fired a gun for sport or in self defense ?
uh , look at the shoulder shrug .
now , she' s evaluating the person asking the question before she ever answers .
i mean , she' s telling rohr exactly what he wants to hear .
so you think she' s iying ?
not necessarily .
but she knows how to .
rikki coleman , 36 years of age .
her husband' s a baptist minister .
she' s a card carrying member of the sierra club and a registered democrat .
ah , i hate baptists almost as much as i hate democrats .
what else you got ?
she had an abortion two years ago .
and , and , and ?
and the guy holding her hand at the clinic , not the baptist minister .
ooh !
tone of voice , body language .
she' s got an open mind .
i like her .
she' s gonna be fair and sympathetic to ms. wood .
mr. rohr , do you wish to exercise challenge for cause ?
no , your honor .
we accept this juror .
mr. cable ?

we accept this juror .
mr. rohr ?
no objection .
we accept this juror .
do you have a gun in your home ?
i' m thinking about getting one .
thank you , mr. black .
a mossberg pump .
i like him !
yes !
thank you , mr. cable .
your honor , we accept this juror .
no objection . ...
frank herrera as a juror .
i' m an auto mechanic .
what about gun control ?
same way i feel about birth control , man .
it doesn' t work .
we accept this juror .
please enter eddie weese as a juror .
yes .
yes , definitely yes .
rohr ?
no challenge .
no , we accept this juror , your honor .
they call me millie .
i' m an ironwork sculptress .
accepted .
go ahead and take her . ... deshazo as a juror .
we accept . ... ms. deets as a juror .
we accept this juror .
having an ak 47 overstates the case .
i want her .
yes , i want her .
no objection , your honor . ... vanessa lembeck as a juror .
mr. cable ?
no challenge .
no , let' s challenge .
preemptory challenge , your honor .
nine millimeter .
it was more of a man' s kind of gun . ... jerry fernandez as a juror .
we talked about this .
i like him a lot .
we know about her ...
i don' t carry a gun .
your honor , we accept ...
let' s not do down this road .
thank you , mr. rohr .
well , thank you all for being here .
thank you .
mr. docken ?
yes , sir .
how do you do ?
fine , thank you .
how do you feel about being a juror in this trial ?
do you feel you could be fair ...
look at the way he' s hunched over and his fingers are interlaced .
i mean , he' s trying too hard not to be too obvious .
yeah , but he' s definitely on our side of the fence .
it' s a veneer .
he' s campaigning .
he wants on .
bounce him , cable .
go ahead and bounce him .
we' re almost out of challenges .
i don' t care !
bounce him !
bounce him , cable !
bounce him !
preemptory challenge , your honor .
hold on .
hear me out .
thank you , mr. docken .
you' re excused .
no , i wanna be heard !
mr. docken , you may be excused .
i wanna be heard !
bailiff !
i wanna be heard !
get that man out of the courtroom .
this is the blood of innocent children gunned down by greedy corporations !
get this self righteous lunkhead outta here !
you son of a bitch !
help him !
help him !
come on !
help this man !
help this man !
get him out of here !
let me go !
it' s not a show in here .
how does it feel ?
get him outta here !
our nation' s trying to kill itself , and you wanna give it the weapons to do it !
you son of a bitch !
let me go !
let me go !
let me go !
greedy bastards !
i guess that' s lunch .
somebody add " class clown " to mr. easter' s ever expanding rsum .
court' s adjourned .
voir dire will resume tomorrow at 9 : 00am .
attorneys , both of you , see me in my chambers right now .
good call .
there are some things , however , that seem to live eternal .
that' s a tendency to always come back , asking for more .
a total of 12 million more .
now , each of our gun companies has already ponied up $4 million into this sportsman' s legacy fund .
now , that may not seem like a hell of a lot of money where you come from , but we think $20 million ought to be enough to secure a jury in the people' s republic of berkeley , california , let alone here .
how about 30, 000 ?
30, 000 ?
what are you talking about ?
it' s an interesting amount to reflect on .
the number of gun deaths every year .
100, 000 .
or we could focus ... on the number one .
because one is all they want .
one win , one precedent .
because once they get that , they' re gonna be traveling around this country , filing civil actions and siphoning away at that $2 billion that you gentlemen sell in firearms and ammo every fiscal year . $2 billion .
whoo !
where i come from , that' s a lot of money .
what i' m asking for is a pittance compared to what a negative verdict is gonna cost you .
our share price is down 25 % just on word of this trial .
i' m down almost 30 .
i' il kick in an extra 1 . 5 , but no ms .
1 . 5 each .
that' s 7 . 5 total .
well , i' il take it .
do you have any additional plans for this pittance ?
matter of fact , i do .
lonnie shaver .
manager here ?
all day .
ernie strode .
i' m gonna put you gentlemen in the grocery business .
grocery business ?
we' re in the process of acquiring your store . ... meeting with all the store managers to discuss their future roles in the organization ...
poor bastard hadn' t had a promotion in five years .
not all employees are gonna make the transition .
we' ve identified you as one of our candidates for the superhouse program .
how soon can we fly you up ?
mr. shaver , in subtle and unspoken ways , will be made to appreciate the terms of advancement in the hammond foods empire .
i don' t like the looks of this one .
ex marine drill instructor .
these people are looking for a leader .
they' il follow frank herrera .
and if they elect someone else foreman ?
whoever they vote for will be following me .
just like in cincinnati and oakland and pittsburgh .
gentlemen , trials are too important to be left up to juries .
god save this state and this honorable court .
good morning , ladies and gentlemen .
you may take your seats .
who' s next ?
herman grimes .
who ?
who' d did he say ?
is there a herman grimes in the court ?
mr. grimes is not on my list .
there' s a swinging door ahead of you , honey .
you got it ?
45 degrees to your left , then 20 degrees to your right .
uh , hold on a minute there , mr. grimes .
there' s no need for you to have come down here today .
you' re excused for reasons of disability .
and what if i do not wish to be excused , sir ?
well ...
i' ve never known a blind man to serve on a jury , and i must say , i can' t recall any case or law or statute that would permit or prevent ...
state v. jack , your honor .
the louisiana supreme court has held that it is a violation of constitutional due process to just automatically dismiss the visually impaired ...
he' s right . ... from jury service .
well , mr. grimes , that' s very impressive .
why are you smiling , sir ?
mr. rohr , mr. cable , any objections to mr. grimes serving on this jury ?
the plaintiffs would welcome mr. grimes to our jury , your honor .
" our jury .
mr. cable ?
as would we on the defense , your honor .
who' s next ?
nicholas easter .
who' s next ?
nicholas easter .
mr. easter ?
mr. rohr .
your honor .
good morning , mr. easter .
good morning .
well , it says here that you work in an electronics store .
yes , sir , that' s correct .
how would you feel if you knew there was a gun behind the counter in case of a robbery ?
well , we' re in the mall , sir .
but i think you' d agree that robberies take place in malls on occasion , do they not ?
yes , but we' re in the esplanade mall , which is right across the street from the sheriff' s office in jefferson parish .
yes , i' m familiar where it is .
well , i mean , you' d have to be on crack to try to rob it .
i guess that' s my point .
i see .
well , tell me ...
mr. easter , that' s the second time you' ve looked at your watch .
are we keeping you from something ?
no , your honor .
i wouldn' t presume to waste your time .
i just ...
i think if you knew my situation , you might be inclined to excuse me from ...
your situation , mr. easter ?
yes , your honor .
it' s the madden challenge .
the madden what ?
you know , " madden football .
it' s a video game .
well , you' d be surprised at how many people play .
at any rate , every year , they choose the best 15 players from across the country to compete in a kind of tournament , you know ,
against nfl players and celebrities ...
i' m not following you .
against nfl players and celebrities ...
i' m not following you .
the prize is $100, 000 .
so i just don' t know if i can afford to pass up the opportunity to make that kind of cash .
it' s a big deal .
i' d like this boy to have a lesson in civic responsibility .
do you have any objection to that , mr. rohr ?
your honor , it' s something i' ve been doing for a very long time .
the jury system was originated , mr. easter , because , for thousands of years before that , an individual judge had the power to hang , for example , any young man he simply did not like .
yes , your honor .
any objections , mr. rohr ?
i have no objection whatsoever , your honor .
mr. cable ?
what do i do ?
any time today , counselor .
harkin sandbagged us .
go ahead and take him .
take him .
uh , no objections , your honor .
enter mr. nicholas easter as a juror .
freeze that right there , will ya ?
freeze it .
there' s always a loose end .
everybody has a secret they don' t want you to find .
find it .
rikki coleman , sylvia deshazo , vanessa lembeck .
herman grimes , millie dupree , eddie weese .
loreen duke , lonnie shaver , frank herrera .
the three alternates .
lydia deets , yoga teacher ,
phillip seville , shrimp fisherman .
henry wu .
let' s find out everything we don' t know .
mr. doyle , you know the city better than anyone .

these are your babies , people .
this is what you live for .
i think you got the wrong apartment .

hm ?
you weren' t there today .
i couldn' t .
i was too nervous .
what are you gonna do ?
you gonna hit me in the head with my ... my george foster big stick ?
what are you nervous about , huh ?
you are not juror number nine in the biggest case of the year .
you' re kidding .
you' re kidding me !
you' re kidding me !
no , i' m not kidding you .
how' d you do it ?
let go of that thing .
how' d you do it ?
madden challenge .
it was a thing of beauty .
the judge even threatened to hang me .
juror number nine .
juror number nine .
what do you have for me ?
i love st. catherine .
how do i look ?
handsome .
do i look honest and trustworthy ?
hm ...
to an innocent eye .
good enough to survive 10 to 15 in the state pen ?
don' t say that .
it' s bad luck .
look ...
we' re not gonna be seeing each other for a while .
they' re gonna be watching us .
you have to come back to bed .
now .
we' re just gonna have to be more careful then , aren' t we ?
how much do you think it' s worth ?
10 , 15 million .
maybe more .
look , that' s enough .
come back to bed .
we only need eight of them for a verdict .
everybody' s got a button .
we just gotta find out where and push .
you have them .
we don' t have anything yet .
... celeste wood .
you' il recall that two years ago ,
wood' s stockbroker husband jacob was gunned down in a mass slaying inside the brokerage firm where he worked . ... two years ago by a failed day trader who later turned the gun on himself .
never before has a jury found the gun industry liable for murder .
you might remember also the former mayor of the city ... ... after her husband was gunned down in the prime of his life .
famed new orleans attorney wendall rohr ...
mr. cable , do you feel that this lawsuit is frivolous ?
uh , it' s capricious .
i find it' s unfortunate that mr. rohr has chosen to use miss wood and the courts as vehicles ...
mr. rohr , how do you expect to win this case ?
it' s very simple .
reckless , profit hungry gun companies like vicksburg have been getting away with murder for too long , and we have ...
i' m losing a lot of money on this jury thing .
oh , really ?
what ?
16 .
16 ?
yeah .
no way . $16 a day ?
what is this , 1892 ?
well , you' re not supposed to do it for the pay , darling .
you' re supposed to do it out of civic duty .
nice to meet you .
frank herrera .
henry wu .
i became a citizen ...
well , he deserves it .
he' s the president of the free world .
there' s coffee and donuts over there .
now , these muffins , i made ' em myself .
a treat for the first day .
these look like they are a treat .
ok .
morning .
well , everyone' s here .
all accounted for ?
good .
i think we should elect a jury foreman , like judge harkin instructed us .
and who would that be , mr. man ?
well , if no one else feels strongly about it , i' d like to throw my hat in the ring .
uh uh , excuse me ...
mister ...
herrera , ma' am .
frank herrera .
mr. herrera .
out of all of us , what makes you think you' re the best person for the job ?
well , miss ...
mrs. loreen duke .
mrs. duke .
mm hm .
i was a master sergeant in the marine corps .
i served my country in panama , grenada , beirut .
you name it , i was there .
i can run a 6 minute mile .
young lady ...
well , if nobody minds , i' d also like to be considered for foreman .
i mean , i might not have served in grenada or panama , but i' m the mother of two small children ...
in that case , y' all ought to consider me .
hell , i got three kids .
ladies and gentlemen , with all due respect ,
i think i know who would make an excellent foreman .
oh , and who might that be , mister ...
easter .
nicholas easter , sir .
i was watching a lot of people very closely during the jury selection , and only this man ...
i don' t know your name , sir .
what is your name ?
herman grimes .
only mr. grimes ...
no , just herman .
only herman had the guts to stand up to the judge , and only herman seems to know a little something about the law .
so , in my book , you know , i think it' d be a good idea for him to represent us .
but ...
but he' s blind , man .
so what ?
so is justice , right ?
that' s right , brother .
what do you think , herman ?
are you up to it ?
well , of course i am .
all in favor of herman .
did i get any votes ?
hey , it' s unanimous .
you' re in .
congratulations .
all right , listen up .
court' s in session .
lunch is set for 1 : 00 .
we order out from verdi' s mart .
please fill out a menu .
make sure you circle what you want , now .
don' t make it too expensive .
thank you .
oh , i had this last week .
it' s really good .
thank you .
think i' m gonna have salmon .
nothing on that menu .
all right , all right .
thank you .
october , two years ago , at 8 : 45 am on a monday morning ,
october , two years ago , at 8 : 45 am on a monday morning , a man by the name of kevin peltier casually walks though the brokerage house from which he was fired the previous friday morning .
he walks into the elevator .
he loads a 36 round magazine into his performa 990 semiautomatic , and when he reaches the third floor , he opens fire on his former coworkers , killing 11 and critically wounding five before turning the gun on himself .
now , they never had a chance .
this was all less than two minutes .
they couldn' t stop him .
11 lives ended .
that' s all you jurors , minus one .
and among them was jacob wood , the husband of my client , celeste wood , and the father of their son henry , six years old .
i don' t know about you , but i' m angry at the tragic and senseless loss of life .
why does the vicksburg firearms company make it so easy to buy these guns on the underground market ?
because they care more about making money than they do about your life or my life or the life of that woman' s husband .
a very courageous former executive of vicksburg firearms is gonna come in here , and he' s gonna testify that this performa 990 semiautomatic was manufactured for , principally , criminals , all those others poised for violence .
excuse me .
would you please give these to mr. rohr and mr. cable ? ... into a very efficient mass murderer .
yes , it was mr. peltier that squeezed the trigger that awful monday morning .
but it was the vicksburg firearms company , through a deliberate and negligent distribution policy , that put that assault type weapon into the hands of mr. peltier .
as such , they were complicit in those murders .
and this i' il prove to you during the course of the trial .
thank you very much .
your honor .
mr. cable .
thank you , your honor .
i feel so nervous .
you' il be fine .
that was quite provocative .
now , i wanna tell you two things about guns today .
i don' t think either of them will be news to you , but the first is guns are dangerous .
they' re guns .
this is their function .
and i wanna tell you today that no one is more aware of that or takes more responsibility for it than the gun industry , especially vicksburg firearms , as a company that' s been in business since before the civil war .
now , the automobile industry works every day to ensure that their cars are safe .
why ?
because they drive them .
now , the people at vicksburg work every day to keep the guns out of the hands of the criminals .
why ?
because they have families with children ...
did you see who handed this to you ?
well , it was a woman .
she had blond hair .
she had pretty blond hair , just like that woman on television .
we didn' t catch her on any of the cctvs .
doesn' t matter .
i' m sure she was wigged .
i doubt you' il find any , but have this sprayed for prints .
anything turns up ...
i' il process it through the printak database .
we' re not here to legislate .
mr. cable is winding up .
this case is about money .
you know , it looks like judge harkin won' t be breaking till after two .
would you mind holding his jury' s lunch order till then ?
thank you .
what do you think about her ?
i hear she teaches a class over at tulane .
yeah ?
wouldn' t mind takin ' that class .
what subject ?
yeah , well , she' s a tall glass of iced tea .
a little too much lemon , a little too much ice .
um , i' m sorry , but would you mind not doing that in here ?
i' m predisposed to asthma .
come on , i' il open the window .
it ain' t gonna bother you .
actually , i mind , too .
sorry .
secondhand smoke .
i gotta tell you , mr. shaver , i don' t wanna smoke your cigarettes , either .
damn .
i can' t smoke , can' t leave the room .
what is this , california ?
it is against the rules .
aw , man , be quiet .
you' re just an alternate , man .
what does that have to do with anything ?
come on , come on .
we' re gonna be here for a while together .
so why are you bothering me ?
you know that i think ?
i think we' re all just really hungry .
and where' s our lunch they promised us ?
it' s 1 : 30 .
that' s why i wanna smoke .
i' m starving .
tamp down my appetite .
herman , you want me to go check out what' s going on with lunch ?
good idea , nick .
go see what' s taking ' em .
so they go over there and he sees a cow and he sees a golf ball up in that cow' s ass .
and he says well , this is delicate " excuse me , ma' am .
and he raises that cow' s tail and says , " does this look like yours ?
and she hit him with a four iron !
excuse me , judge .
huh ?
there' s someone to see you .
all right , all right .
excuse me , gentlemen .
you are ... ?
nick easter , juror number nine .
yes .
now , what do you think you' re doing outside of that jury room ,
mr. easter juror number nine ?
and where' s lou dell ?
she' s chattin ' it up in the hallway , sir .
well , mr. easter ,
i would strongly advise you to return to that jury room and finish your lunch .
that' s the problem , sir .
i think somebody forgot to order our lunch .
the jury has no lunch ?
that' s why i' m here , sir .
everybody knows you here in the parish .
they know you like to keep a tight schedule on your bench .
if we' re gonna be back in less than 45 minutes ...
i gotta be honest with you , sir .
we' re hungry .
well , what exactly , mr. easter , would you like me to do ?
hey , lonnie , lonnie !
could you pass me some garlic bread ?
you got any over there ?
oh , absolutely , man .
stuff is delicious .
i' m not sure , but i believe i' m buying lunch for this jury .
jury' s right there .
well , in 35 years , that is the most absurd thing i' ve ever seen .
you got a little mustard on your tie .
i did it on purpose .
first day of the trial , judge is having lunch with the jury .
what' s that about ?
look at that .
what ?
let' s go .
hey , hey , hey !
to nick !
to nick !
this is horseshit .
it wasn' t me .
it wasn' t me .
it was judge harkin .
judge harkin !
ok , that' s enough .
thank you very much .
all right .
here' s the deposition you needed .
thank you , thank you .
we gonna talk about this ?
i cannot believe you had the nerve to bring that in this office .
i think we ought to discuss it at least .
why don' t you just give it to the judge ?
' cause they' d throw the case out .
let me explain something to you .
that' s a defense tactic , ok ?
all it' s meant to do is just throw our focus off , so that we can just move toward a mistrial .
but i' d really like it out of the office , so give it to me , please .
barry , after you shred it , burn it .
ok ?
you know how many of those crank things i get ?
what if it' s for real ?
no , it' s not for real .
what if it is ?
well , if it' s for real , then this isn' t a trial , is it ?
then this is just an auction , and i might as well get on this phone here and call up all those anti gun activist friends of mine in washington and tell ' em we' re just gonna put on a telethon and we will buy this verdict .
' cause they' re not gonna think of that , are they ?
somebody wanna get that phone ?
you got any other suggestions ?
well , look at it .
syntax , handwriting , word choice .
clearly a woman did the note .
someone' s working the inside .
a juror .
miss monroe , i think seven hours spent on this topic is sufficient .
can we agree ?
mr. fitch , i got a call for you .
line seven .
yes .
hello , rankin .
i' m the agent handling the property you were notified about earlier today .
i' d like to know who i' m speaking with .
you can call me marlee .
pay phone , 15 miles away .
you can call me marlee .
where are we going with this , marlee ?
all the way to the verdict .
the fact is , the jury' s mine , and i can push it either way .
for a price .
sounds good .
so good , in fact , i don' t believe you can do it .
i' il bet you' re old enough to remember a time when people delivered on what they promised .
i' m one of those people .
i' m also old enough to remember watergate , abscam , linda tripp ... ... and a whole bunch of other times people got entrapped for engaging in conversations just like this , and you' d do very good to remember that , young lady .
there are consequences .
well , let me worry about those .
for now , i just hope you' re feeling patriotic .
you hope i' m feeling ...
patriotic ?
morning , nick .
morning , lou .
good morning , vanessa .
morning .
nick .
hey , guys .
how you doin ' ?
what' s up ?
ok .
hey , lonnie , sylvia .
hey , man .
good morning , frank .
frank , you were in panama and grenada , right ?
and beirut .
wow .
that really must' ve been something , huh ?
yeah .
pulling the bodies of friends of mine out of the rubble .
it was really something , nick .
no , no , no , no .
you don' t understand .
i had a friend who was in desert storm .
he was in the corps , too .
what division ?
the 1 4 out of pendleton .
yeah , well , that was mostly air power .
not much real action down there anyhow .
actually , there was , frank .
you don' t know what the hell you' re talking about , easter .
my friend' s name was donny rabbs , and his helicopter was shot down in a kuwaiti oil field .
he was killed 12 years ago today .
sorry to hear that .
i' m sorry .
it' s just a strange day .
i always figure , if i don' t remember him today , nobody else will .
that' s the way people are .
short memories .
that' s a terrible thing , y' all , but we don' t always know god' s plan .
listen , i don' t know if it' d be inappropriate , but do you think we could do something today to remember him ?
we could say the lord' s prayer .
well , i don' t wanna ask people to pray .
how about " god bless america " ?
i couldn' t ask people to sing .
i don' t sing .
i don' t sing , ok ?
you know what ?
i have an idea .
good morning .
you may take your seats , please .
i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america and to the republic for which it stands , one nation under god , indivisible , with liberty and justice for all .
i don' t know about you , wendall , but i' m feeling pretty patriotic .
uh , thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
will you please take your seats ?
jesus .
shit .
pull !
you wanted to see me ?
mr. cable called me last night in a bit of a panic .
now , he' s concerned that someone' s trying to monkey with our jury .
as am i. as are my associates .
who is it ?
it' s a parlor game .
just because somebody can influence where a jury has lunch , that doesn' t mean they can hand us the verdict .
ah , well , you see , mr. fitch , this is where i get a little confused , because i was under the impression that we had already purchased ourselves a verdict .
you know what i love best about this gun ?
though it' s 70 years old , it' s just as reliable as the day it was made .
mr. fitch !
you find out who it is , will you ?
pull ! ... one nation under god ...
at some point , everyone on the jury acknowledges herrera , like they' re doing it for him .
it' s not him .
right here at the end , loreen duke , our juror number 10 ...
right there .
freeze there .
yeah .
tighten in on her left hand .
right there .
isn' t that sweet ?
nicholas easter , our song and dance man , has an agenda .
mr. lamb , how did this confidence man crash my jury pool ?
i don' t know .
i' d i' d need some time , sir .
now .
i' m asking for an educated guess .
maybe he just did it .
i mean , who wants jury duty ?
nobody , right ?
it' s like going to the dentist .
it' s worse than going to the dentist .
it' s a municipal database that nobody would ever wanna hack into .
the security protocol is weak , so he' d put a name on the list ...
i got it .
i got it , mr. lamb .
thank you .
mr. doyle ?
i' m on it .
your honor .
good afternoon , mr. murphy .
you own and operate excalibur guns .
yes , sir , i do .
yes , and isn' t excalibur guns a retail outlet store
for vicksburg firearms ?
yes , sir .
would you tell us about your arrangement with a man ,
michael kincaid , who illegally sold this performa 990 semiautomatic to kevin peltier smack dab out of the trunk of his car ?
my arrangement ?
yes , sir .
well , mikey ...
mr. kincaid bought guns from my store ...
at a rate of more than 25 guns a month , didn' t you ever wonder who your friend mikey was turning around and selling these guns to ?
well , that' s none of my business .
oh , you mean it' s not your problem .
now , hold on there .
i didn' t say that .
objection , your honor .
the counsel is testifying .
sustained .
mr. rohr ...
yo !
thanks a lot .
afternoon .
afternoon .
... your friend michael kincaid 28 guns in december .
now , did you ever wonder why one man would buy 112 guns in a period of four months ?
a collector ?
a collector , sir ?
112 weapons , and all of them semiautomatic assault weapons ?
i don' t know .
come on , take a guess .
christmas presents ?
that' s a guess .
objection , your honor .
this is all speculation .
sustained .
did they send a field rep
out to investigate ?
no , sir .
no , because they were very pleased with your success , weren' t they ?
say again ?
is it not true that vicksburg firearms , instead of investigating the increasing number of guns that were being sold to one man , instead send you and your wife on a trip to jamaica .
no .
no ?
my wife hates jamaica .
we switched to cancun .
i have no further questions , your honor .
thank you , mr. rohr .
we' il adjourn today .
hold cross till tomorrow .
release the jury 45 minutes early .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
oh , hi .
yeah , the landlord let me in .
he said some of the tenants had been having trouble with the cable .
uh huh .
but , uh ...
i checked yours out and , uh ...
hey !
whoa !
hey !
... looks fine .
i don' t think you have anything ...
what do we got , people ?
the drive' s been erased twice over .
it' s empty .
but it' s not zeroed out .
he may have been more sloppy than he thought .
give me a few moments .
mr. fitch .
lamb , trace it .
fitch here .
you don' t play nice .
what are you talking about ?
you broke into nick easter' s apartment .
you freely assume it was me .
oh , wouldn' t you be disappointed if i didn' t ?
i' m bumping a juror .
one of yours .
this time it' s just gonna be a pinprick .
next time it' s really gonna hurt .
looks like somebody had themselves a good time last night .
i woke up on my stove .
oh , man .
you don' t got any aspirin , do you ?
uh uh .
i think i can do a little bit better than an aspirin .
yeah ?
mm hm .
a little hair of the dog .
oh .
can you sweeten this up for me ?
yeah , put it under the table .
you' re an angel .
no , let me pour it .
i' il pour it .
let me do it .
let me do it !
it' s mine , sir .
i didn' t take you for a day drinker , mr. easter .
i' m usually not .
you still trying to get off my jury ?
is that it ?
your honor , i took an oath to do my level best , and i meant it .
difficult as that is to believe , mr. easter , it' s even more difficult to believe this is your liquor .
i might be wrong , but i don' t think that' s your shade of lipstick .
ms. hullic ?
and moving into ms. hullic' s spot will be first alternate ms. lydia deets .
ms. deets ... will you join the jurors in the box , please ?
welcome to our jury .
i trust you got the same instructions the rest of the jurors did .
you ready to go ?
yes , sir .
very good .
well ...
cell phone , untraceable .
marlee ?
i' d like your offer , mr. fitch .
not over the phone .
if you thought this whole thing was gonna take place long distance , you' re mistaken .
you wanna lose another juror ?
anybody can get a juror booted .
that doesn' t show me that you can deliver a verdict .
hell , i could get nick easter canned if i put five man hours into it .
but you won' t do that .
you need him to guarantee the jury swings your way .
so next time i call , have your offer ready .
ladies and gentlemen , this girl is an amateur .
you understand ?
a dilettante !
and i want this nonsense ended today !
i want you to find her !
i want you to contain her !
because you' re losing me my jury !
now find something on every one of them !
pull their files !
review every word , every photo , every medical record .
do it !
who do we have ?
rikki coleman' s boyfriend' s name is neil pollard .
mrs. coleman broke it off with him two months after the abortion .
who' s gonna help daddy ?
me , me !
the good news is mr. coleman has racked up three cases of domestic battery , and there' s no way she would' ve cried on his shoulder about it .
your husband looks a lot different than your boyfriend with you at the clinic .
we' il be in touch .
back up , back up !
