what do you make of this ?
what is it ?
clive thinks he' s found a volcanic pipe .
elementary geology , pal .
there are no volcanoes around here .
ergo no volcanic pipes , and therefore no diamonds .
i don' t think i' ve found a pipe .
i think there' s something on this readout that looks like a pipe .
it' s weird .
where is it ?
about six , seven kliks that way .
jesus !
have you seen anything like this ?
it' sjust a bloody lump of sandstone .
maybe some kind of pressure dome .
it' s weird , though .
well , let' s take some samples and get going .
hey , guys , come and have a look over here .
emergency .
temperature drop .
what' s happening ?
system failure on the antarctica module .
it' s not responding .
primary feed valve' s iced up .
i' m gonna activate the bypass .
you work on re routing the secondary .
come on , mel , they' ve got less than a minute .
zack !
where the hell are you ?
we' re right here , barb .
hang in there .
mel , find the glitch .
we flight tested this situation a thousand times .
what' s happening ?
terry' s starting to hypotherm out here !
any second now .
mel ?
i can' t find it !
it' s forty degrees below outside !
sequence analyzer to override .
it' s not designed for this matrix .
i know , just do it .
the whole system could shut down .
mel , i know .
just do it .
he' s going into shock !
just do it !
it' s stabilizing , zack .
temperature' s rising .
sorry about that , guys .
won' t happen again .
for the money , the sooner we replace them with druids , the better .
you' re all heart , doc .
good work , guys .
there' s a site call out for a systems analyst .
you' re it , zack .
shit !
this cannot be happening .
listen , i' ve got ajackhammer running through my head ... and i think i left my tongue somewhere over the atlantic .
i don' t suppose ...
what' s that ?
tylenol !
cool .
extra strong .
hi .
you look like shit .
it' s nice to meet you too .
no , i ...
welcome to hell .
hi .
i' m doctor zack straker .
i' m making a site call at c camp .
apparently i' m supposed to clear security here .
hi .
passport , please .
that water system , was that your bright idea ?
yeah , i designed it .
so you' re the oke who' s got everyone drinking each other' s piss ?
it' s recycled .
the water' s distilled .
it' s more pure than the snowmelt from the himalayas .
you won' t catch me drinking it .
jesus !
fatty nghuza works up at c camp .
enough said .
you okay ?
hot , hot , hot .
an alarm went off down on the south side .
another snake in the electric fence .
look at this .
big one , too .
i need to see your case .
that' s kinda personal .
call me an optimist .
what' s this ?
it' s charlie .
he' s cute .
it' s a prototype .
it' s a subterranean analyzer .
what does it do ?
well , it sees through rock strata and ... it can find water up to a hundred feet deep .
i can do that with a fucking twig , mate .
i hope he lasts longer than the last one .
if you' d like to fill that out .
mikki ?
is this what you' re looking for ?
give it to her .
well , fuck you and the horse you rode in on , pal .
he' s one bone headed son of a bitch !
could have handled it myself , karl .
i' m sure you could have .
some prospector have managed to get themselves lost .
i guess it' s your lucky day .
thanks .
why , exactly ?
the truck' s taking emergency fuel up to the zone ... and we pick up the prospectors en route .
how long will it take ?
about sixteen hours if we go straight through .
all depends on how long it takes to find them .
is there a problem ?
baby , there' s no problem when old kurt' s around .
so what you doing then ?
listen , i do the technical shit ... you drive .
okay ?
you riding with us ?
yeah .
first time in the desert , i want to see it up close .
you' il get that all right , my friend .
what' s with all the fire power ?
last month , one of our trucks was hijacked by rebels .
shot up the fuel tanker ... wiped out the driver .
not a pretty sight .
rebels , huh ?
they' re after the diamonds .
you' il only frighten the poor baby .
all aboard !
how much more of this is there ?
from here on in , pal ... nothing but sand and rock for another thousand kilometers .
jesus !
who ever heard of prospectors getting lost , huh ?
hey , magda ?
which truck did they say was missing ?
harvey slater' s outfit .
clive is on that truck .
got it , magda .
to your right .
about four o' clock .
ja , that' s them .
hang on tight , here we go .
is it clive ?
yep .
and i think that' s what' s left of paul .
you ever done a murder investigation ?
so what we do ?
call in the police .
they' ve only been dead for ... six , seven hours , but look at the state of them .
yep .
d' you know who' s missing ?
probably harvey .
if i catch the fucker , he' s dead .
you can' t think harvey did this ?
i see two bodies .
one missing .
until i speak with harvey , he' s it .
hey !
karl !
over here !
titus has got something .
okay , harvey .
we' ve got you now , boy !
i don' t understand .
what ?
when we started ... there were two feet .
but now there' s four here .
these tracks go on for bloody miles .
it' s bizarre .
what are they ?
kurt .
go get magda to bring the truck .
they' il pick us up .
don' t .
sorry .
a religious thing , huh ?
no , not my religion .
they' rejust a warning .
let' s get out of here .
let' s get out of here .
now .
come on , magda .
he' s running !
there' s not much left .
i' ve never seen anything like it .
any sign of a struggle ?
not that i can see .
listen ...
i think harvey slater' s on the run .
get me some experts up here .
a forensics , or something .
roger .
but it' il take a couple of days to organize .
so get up to c camp for further instructions .
negative .
i' m gonna find harvey first .
if the wind come up , his tracks will be gone by tomorrow .
to the left there , magda , over that dune .
now what ?
are you gonna tell me he ran thirty or forty kliks ... then died , then got eaten clean , all in about nine hours ?
i' m not telling you anything .
maybe you' re confused .
maybe you think these are footprints .
please .
please .
it' s impossible .
it' s the wrong body , guys .
harvey' s back there somewhere .
didn' t harvey slater have a motorbike crash a couple of years back ?
stuffed up his leg real bad ?
he had a limp .
he had a plate .
how are you doing , harvey ?
this cannot be harvey fucking slater !
this is a dead end .
we have to retrace our steps .
the guys at basejust said we' ve gotta stop playing detective .
we' ve got to get this fuel up to c camp .
there' s a killer out there , magda .
if we move up north now , we will never catch him .
it' s not our call , karl .
well , you do what you want .
i' m going after him .
it' il be dark in an hour .
we' re here for the night .
there' s a site call out for a systems analyst .
i don' t do fieldwork .
i like the outfit , by the way .
it' s natty .
michaela .
but everybody calls me mikki .
i don' t understand .
when we started ... there were two feet .
but now there' s four here .
tokolosh .
a religious thing ?
not my religion .
it' s just a warning .
it' s just a warning .
so cool .
hey , surfer boy !
you almost gave me a heart attack .
did you see me out there ?
you should try that .
maybe some other time .
like in the morning .
oh , shit , i' m keeping everyone up !
well , you and charlie .
damn thing' s been beeping all night .
it still needs some work .
it' s freezing !
that' s the desert for you .
too hot during the day and ... well , it' s ... too cold at night .
relax , townie .
body warmth .
stay close , stay warm .
first rule of survival out here .
i think i could learn to like this body warmth kind of thing .
in some countries ... we' d be considered engaged by now .
god ... people still get engaged ?
round here , we don' t get much beyond the screwing stage .
i ...
relax .
are you and karl ...
we ... had a brief thing .
past tense , huh ?
and you ?
my work keeps me pretty busy .
i design extreme survival systems .
would you two shut up out there ?
i' m gonna head back in .
i think i' il stay out here for a while .
well , don' t freeze , all right ?
wake up !
wake up , people !
there' s something out there !
what ?
karl , i' m serious , man .
there is something out there .
oh , come on !
we' re in the middle of the desert .
whatever it is you' re smoking or drinking , either stop it ... or share it out , all right ?
i' m not kidding .
it was as big as a goddamn grizzly bear !
this is africa .
there are no bears !
i know that , karl !
it wasn' t a tiger or a rhino or a gorilla either .
what' s your problem , then ?
my problem is that bigfoot nearly cashed my check !
what !
oh , great .
sleep it off .
what are we supposed to do ?
the bones are gone .
what are you talking about ?
okay , what' s the game ?
you' d better tell me right now .
you think this is a game ?
what did you do with the bones ?
you listen to me , pal .
there is some very weird shit going on out here .
what i just saw ... you think it' s impossible ?
but i just fucking saw it .
you explain that , then .
i' m a scientist .
i find facts , i collect data ...
and i derive conclusions .
so , start fucking deriving !
what' s going on ?
i have no idea .
yet .
that' s great .
so much for science .
it' s a tokolosh .
what is that ?
tokolosh ?
you know sometimes bad shit happens ?
here it doesn' tjust happen .
a tokolosh does it .
you walk into a door , a tokolosh caused it .
you bang your thumb with a hammer .
tokolosh !
a fucking asteroid wipes out the planet .
tokolosh .
karl ... you are starting to piss me off .
it' s bullshit , titus .
with a capital bull !
have you ever heard of esikhulu ?
what' s that ?
the sandmother .
she was the first .
and she will be the last .
she takes what belongs to her .
the animals .
the people .
and she drinks the life from their bones .
and this way she lives forever .
brother fights against brother .
father turns against son .
she breaks people ... apart .
come on , people .
let' s move it out .
over here .
guys .
got it .
footprints go up the side of the dune .
karl ?
karl ?
what ?
over here .
now we go and catch this son of a bitch .
let' s go !
come on , magda .
we' re moving .
twenty minutes .
then we can go .
now !
it' s dark , karl .
so bloody what ?
how are you gonna follow footsteps in the dark ?
with your torch ?
jesus , magda !
we' re trying to catch a multiple murderer .
give us a break , man !
this isn' t my call , karl .
and when we can see what we' re following , then we go .
until then , this baby stays put .
do you want to radio it in ?
does anybody want to radio in and tell the folks back home ... how we' ve got it all under control ?
just over the dune .
magda , kill the engine .
come on .
mikki ?
titus .
there !
son of a ...
what the fuck is that ?
we' ve got him .
give me that .
d' you hit him ?
what happened ?
i heard a gunshot .
nothing .
just a pile of bones .
harvey .
it' s the same bones .
what happened , karl ?
i don' t fucking know , titus !
you catch him ?
what the hell is this place ?
are you okay ?
fine .
you ?
no , i' m not okay .
i' m about as far away from okay as possible .
stop bloody whining .
this is way beyond my frame reference .
you should speak to ol ' titus , then .
to him it' s all meat and potatoes .
i' m warning you , man .
don' t push me .
it can' t have gone far .
get this bloody heap going .
check the ammo .
you know what it is , don' t you ?
when i was a young man ... one of our shepherd boys wandered off .
and a few hours later , his skull was found ... picked clean .
bones that walk .
and flesh that disappears .
you call it whatever you want .
we call it esikhulu .
come on , magda .
let' s move .
he' s running again .
out !
everyone out !
clear !
what was that all about ?
kurt , fix this crap !
well , the battery' s okay .
but half the insulation' s gone from the wiring .
so , can you fix it ?
give me a week and a full workshop , no problem .
somebody better get on the field radio and let the mine know ... that we need some help .
calling eland mine , this is echo zero three , are you reading ?
calling eland mine .
anyone out there ?
this is echo zero three , is anybody reading this ?
the damn thing' s broken .
i' m gonna try an emergency beacon .
it' s about damn time .
hey , come back !
come back !
he' s seen us .
don' t panic , china .
they' il send a rescue truck for us in a couple of days , okay ?
yeah ?
how do you know ?
we might look like clowns ... but believe it or not , we actually know what we' re doing .
all right , but we' re out here for two days .
this is an emergency .
why ?
we' ve got supplies .
they send a truck , we get a tan .
it' s better than working .
magda , what have you got in here ?
shop said i was a fool , thought i' d never use it .
k rations .
tastes like crud , but it' s better than nothing .
are you gonna wear that ?
it' s gonna be cold tonight .
i' m gonna find a rock .
mikki , go with magda .
who suddenly made you the boss ?
it' s either mikki or me .
nobody does anything by themselves anymore .
we already have three dead bodies .
jesus , it stinks in here !
titus .
your watch , buddy .
seen anything ?
kurt .
kurt ?
shit !
karl !
karl !
it' s got kurt !
karl !
come here !
what is that ?
it' s okay .
get him up off the ground .
get him in the truck !
karl , get out of there !
pull him .
help me get him back to the truck .
oh my god !
move it !
they' re still coming !
enough shooting .
plan b.
karl , what the hell are you doing ?
torch them !
i' ve got to reload .
i' m not gonna end up like kurt ... and the others .
there' s a thousand litres of fuel , karl .
you' re gonna take us all with you .
oh god !
i walk through the valley ...
pray hard , sweetheart .
sometimes ... praying just isn' t enough .
no , wait .
look !
they' re turning away .
see anything ?
nothing .
that should steady him .
he' s losing a lot of blood .
he' s in shock .
we' ve got to get him to a hospital .
soon .
what else have you got ?
in that first aid kit ?
i' m gonna go pour out more fuel .
move .
now !
what the hell are you doing ?
it' s turning away .
let it go !
enough .
if you two want to behave like arseholes , that' s fine by me ... but right now , if we don' t work together , we' re finished .
if i see any more of this crap ...
are we clear ?
well ... shooting it wasn' t working .
so what are you gonna do ?
reason it to death ?
buy us some time .
there' s a system at work here , karl .
methodology .
you tell that to kurt and titus .
we' ve got to get him help , fast .
the prospector truck has a radio .
that' il take a good two days .
at first light , we move out .
you want to carry him forty kliks across the desert ?
that' s gonna help ?
what else can we do ?
she will ... tear you apart .
leave titus with me .
i can medicate him ... and pray .
oh , enough mumbo jumbo .
i say we all go .
we don' t have a choice .
who' s we , karl ?
i have a choice .
i' m staying .
there' s enough fuel in this thing to wipe out anything that might come back .
leave titus with me .
his chances are better if he stays here .
that' s one hell of a choice , babe .
you were ready to roast us all back there .
you leave that whisky alone and you start bloody thinking clearly !
the sandmother .
she is searching for her children .
take it easy , man .
not now , titus .
karl .
that thing .
if it is searching ...
i' ve never seen anything like it before .
maybe he' s right .
it' s changing and ... it' s evolving right in front of our eyes .
the sandmother .
she takes what belongs to her .
then she drains the life from their bones .
she breaks people ... apart .
come on .
where is it ?
i' m getting a reading from somewhere there .
that' s great .
that thing of yours is useless .
can' t even find the water that we' re supposed to find .
it doesn' tjust find water .
it also analyses if it' s safe or not ... by determining its acidity .
right now i' m getting a reading that' s right off the scale .
from what ?
ants .
formic acid .
ants have formic acid .
it' s what they use to kill their prey .
it' s one of the most powerful acids there is .
ants !
look .
what the hell is that ?
sandstorm .
take cover .
where ?
move it !
there' s sand everywhere .
are we all okay ?
where' s the fuel ?
thejerrycan .
it' s almost empty .
charlie ...
it' s fucked .
so , my friend ... are we .
how much further ?
we could go right past it .
he' s right .
let' s stop here for the night and carry on in the morning .
the prospector' s truck can' t be far .
we should rest for the night .
well ... this is about as bad place as any .
this gasoline should keep it away .
that' s the end of it .
you know ... this petrol will evaporate soon .
yeah .
what' s that sound ?
it' s the sound of the desert .
what ?
it' s when ... the grains of sand roll against each other .
they create this ... vibrating moan .
what causes the grains of sand to roll against each other ?
normally the wind .
there is no wind .
my god !
magda !
it got magda .
what the fuck is that ?
ants .
listen .
radio .
that' s the prospector' s truck .
it must bejust over that dune .
lucky the radio still works .
johan will be here soon .
take a look at this .
karl .
give me your flashlight .
what is it ?
i don' t know for sure , but ... it looks like some kind of nursery .
a nursery ?
for what ?
the queen .
what ?
that creature .
esikhulu .
it' s ants .
the ants on titus ... they were solid , man , like flesh .
that' s it !
they just want the bones .
it gives them structure like a skeleton .
when you shot up the sleeping bag , we smashed up the bones .
so then it needed one of us .
but why ?
survival .
her home' s been busted up .
she can' t go anywhere alone .
give her a set of bones ... she can go everywhere .
ants ?
that' s impossible .
why ?
they' ve been here since before the dinosaurs .
millions of years .
it' s like titus said .
esikhulu .
in the heart of the colony ...
lies the queen .
karl ?
get out of the hole .
drop your gun .
now !
mikki , drop your gun now .
you' re under arrest .
move .
down on your knees .
don' t be stupid , johan .
we don' t have time for this .
shut up !
they sent me to sort out this mess .
where are the others ?
they' re all dead .
back up there .
who' s dead ?
the prospectors .
magda , titus , kurt ...
magda , dead ?
bullshit !
listen to us , johan .
why ?
you' re supposed to be at c camp .
and now you people are all here .
and half you crew' s dead .
no one killed anyone .
don' t you see ?
it' s esikhulu .
jesus !
you people are bloody crazy .
i know what happened here .
the prospectors found a diamond pipe and they probably grabbed some stones .
you think we stole the diamonds ?
fucking a , pal .
and now i got the whole lot of you .
you' re gonna sit for a long time .
nice try , sweetheart .
now , get across there with your boyfriend before i get really cross .
you always were a pig , johan .
was that your secret weapon , karl ?
you' re gonna have to try a lot harder than that .
get in the bloody truck !
fuck you !
move !
maybe when we get back to the fuel truck ... he' il see what we' re talking about and let us go .
this idiot' s been itching to take me down .
if he finds what' s left of titus and magda ... he' il use that against us .
look and learn , my friend .
look and learn .
karl !
stop !
he' il come around soon .
he' il be okay .
now let' s get out of here .
not yet .
we' re going after it .
are you crazy ?
this is our chance .
mikki , this thing is too unique .
we can' tjust walk away from it .
this thing is a fucking killer !
exactly .
and right now , it' s between us ... and c camp .
now , it' s looking for a nest .
some place it can ...
start a new colony .
right .
the old evangeline mine .
that' s right .
this time we level the playing field .
gently , gently .
nitroglycerin .
hey , what about me ?
you ?
you can eat shit and die .
you' re under arrest for murder !
does it look like i' m under arrest ?
i' il get you for this , karl .
i swear !
shit !
just point and shoot .
all right .
it could be anywhere .
we' re never gonna see it .
guys .
it' s a generator .
forget it .
this place has been out of use for ages .
it' s still got compression .
let me see your knife .
you' re wasting time , man .
all right , smart ass .
now , let' s get down to business .
we have to go low .
the nest' il be buried .
watch your step , guys .
there it is !
mikki .
you want to play hard to get , do you ?
karl !
what ?
we should stick together .
stop !
get down !
it wants you to go in there .
let it comes to us !
no !
we must finish it now !
karl !
karl , get out of there !
get out of there !
here !
you okay ?
not bad for a city boy .
it' s got me by the leg !
hang on .
oh god !
we got you .
karl !
hang on !
get out , it' s gonna blow .
it' s starting to collapse !
it' s the queen .
mikki , look !
it' s like a giant brain .
the central intelligence .
the walls are moving !
mikki ...
this is the controlling organism .
then let' s kill the bitch and get out of here !
kill it !
do it now !
i can' t .
we' ve got to get out of here .
kill it !
kill it !
come on !
run !
it' s through here .
are you okay ?
i' ve been better .
it' s all right .
it' s over .
come on .
oh my god !
johan !
what ?
well ... they' ve isolated that place so well ... there' s nothing that can get through .
you know ...
i think i could get into this fieldwork stuff .
does that mean ... you' il be moving round more ?
yeah .
i mean , there' s plenty of time later to think about settling down .
amen to that .
there' s a big world out there .
wouldn' t want to paint it .
here .
you should have this .
maybe we should get ...
the spares for the mine .
yeah .
come .
okay , let' s put this in the back of the taxi .
are you sure you won' t come ?
i' m not ready to go back .
they still need me up at the c camp .
fatty nghuza .
take care of yourself , surfer boy .
esikhulu .
