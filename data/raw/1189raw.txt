it' s that he' s proud .
that' s all i' m saying .
the shed i got him out of was just full of these old trophies .
i think he used to be a racecar .
a racecar ?
yeah .
you know , i bet it took first place at the ugly anapolis 500 .
oh !
oh !
oh , ow !
what did ... ?
it wasn' t the car !
all right .
just be calm .
i don' t have to take this .
this is just a car ... an inanimate object .

we' il be roommates for 1 5 minutes .
an assistant producer job at espn .
you' il be in front of the camera in a heartbeat .
have a great time in paris .
bye .
be back in a month .
i' il spring you from riverside .
we' il cruise to the big apple and start our new lives .
au revoir !
i promised your brother we' d meet him at the track .
we got to go .
do i even get a graduation lunch ?
well , this isn' t quite what i had in mind , but ...
hey , i sprung for the churros .
dad , is sally still sponsoring you ?
one of the proud , the few .
hey , guys !
congrats on the espn job !
thank you .
i thought maggie might swing some free publicity over there .
only publicity team peyton needs is to win a race .
we' re turning this thing around .
i know it .
believe me .
aw , come on , ray .
what are you doing ?
ray , what ... ?
ow .
ray , you were just pushing the right front .
was that what it is ?
did you learn that in college ?
thanks !
at least he loses with style .
he' s sure had enough practice .
i can' t believe trip murphy won daytona .
he' s a loser .
a well paid loser .
hey , ray , the guy' s a great racer .
say what you want about him .
he has excellent focus .
focus .
you drove past that tree on purpose .
no .
we' re taking a shortcut .
you were gonna chop it down .
we tried to knock it down by crashing a car into it ...
oh , wait !
that was you !
oh , right .
i' m not the one who crashes into walls , am l ?
don' t let him get to you .
the important thing is when you see that tree and this town in your rearview mirror , you know you' re on your way to a better life .
right ?
right .
all right .
now you , gramps , had style .
he sure did .
listen .
i' m sorry i didn' t really pull out all the stops for graduation .
it' s ok .
you know , that was always mom' s department .
it' s been ten years .
i should have more of a clue .
i didn' t know the team was doing so badly .
maggie , it' s a bad streak .
we' il pull out of it .
but i do think it' s time we find room for you up on that wall .
that ought to do it justice .
night , dad .
night , baby .
tomorrow morning , getting you a graduation present .
it' s ok .
i really don' t need anything .
i want to .
first thing , bright and early , you and me .
you get to pick it out .

good night .
good night .
dad , uh , what are we doing here ?
buying you a car .
i appreciate the gesture , but i' m only here a month .

there' s a certified pre owned champion out there waiting to be discovered .
a car with the guts , the character , the heart of a thoroughbred .

since you are the first customer today ,
i think i can cut you a deal .
hmm .
i' il give you 50 for the bug .

i wouldn' t sell in a million years .

oh , my god !

oh ...

i swear to god , i did not do that !
ok , try telling that to him .
race !
race !
race !
race !
trip !
you gonna take that ?
race , race , race !
i can' t race .
get out there and tell them i' m sorry !
i love that i have to do this .
sure .
' cause trip and i have such a good rapport .
race !
race !
race !
what have i got to lose ?
it' s a bug .
open .
oh , my god !
kevin !
kevin !
help me !
kevin !
kevin !
mags !
what are you doing ?
kevin !
what is going on ?
i don' t want to race !
kevin !
kevin !
race , race , race , race !
what are you trying to do , you crazy little car ?
born to be wild ]
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
ok .
so that' s how you want to do it ?
i thought you said you hadn' t been racing .
that was unbelievable !
i know .
unbelievable .
hey , trip .
what do you say ?
get that camera out of my face !
did you see me come off that guardrail ?
i saw ...
i don' t know how you did that .
all right .
this is gonna sound strange , but it wasn' t me .
i think it was herbie .
herbie is a car .
you always said they had personalities .
yeah , personalities .
they' re not possessed .
i can' t explain it , but when trip blocked me on that final turn ,
i wished i was on my skateboard so i could rail slide past .
then herbie did it .
it was like we were connected .
that makes perfect sense .
cuckoo !
what are you doing ?
checking to make sure exhaust fumes haven' t gone back inside the car .
kevin , i beat the reigning nascar champion in a ' 63 bug !
how else do you explain that ?
how about , you' re an amazing racer and proved it ?
why are you afraid to admit that ?
you beat trip murphy , on your own , with this ... hunk of junk .
ow !
hey .
admit it .
it felt great to be behind the wheel again .
yeah .
it did .
that' s what i thought .
the family' s been in racing for 40 years .
i won' t let guys in suits tell me what to do .
these guys pay our bills .
what do they know about racing ?
they know not to back a losing team !
another sponsor bite the dust ?
they come , they go .
that' s business .
you got in late last night .
let me direct you to the date of birth on my license .
let me direct you to the address on that license .
my house , my rules .
hey , guys !
hey , sally .
hey , sal .
don' t tell me you' re pulling out too .
no .
i' m making your day .
you' re gonna love this .
taking the sports world by storm .
here it is again .
our exclusive footage of trip murphy just getting scorched in an impromptu street race .
the competition was a 1963 volkswagen beetle .
that' s right , folks .
a ' 63 bug .
i' il be back .
dad !
what did i do ?
i sense you' re looking for an explanation .
you promised , no more street racing .
listen to me .
i almost lost you once .
i' m not gonna let that happen again .
at least let me explain first .
ok , go ahead .
i' m all ears .
i ran into kevin .
kevin ?
you aren' t in town 24 hours , and goofy kevin talks you into street racing again .
maggie .
do you think i busted my butt to put you through school so you could get back behind the wheel of a racecar ?
dad , i wasn' t even driving .
who was ?
it was kevin' s friend , maxx , who was driving .
they wanted to challenge trip , so i let them borrow the car , and it was a one shot deal .
promise ?
i mean , yeah .
yeah .
sorry .
i' m sorry too .
whoever this maxx guy is , must be pretty good if he beat trip murphy in a little thing like that .
not bad .
more than a feeling ]
life' s a trip .
then you drive .
cut .
i nailed that one .
i agree .
i' d love to try one more .
it doesn' t get much better than that .
ok .
moving on !
can i talk to you ?
what is it ?
the sponsors are all over me , and the espn special is down the drain because you banished the film crew .
i won' t talk about yesterday .
i' m not .
i' m talking about tomorrow .
this is your future .
those people paid for it ,
so get your head in the game ...
i can' t deal with this , larry !
good hustle , everybody .
good hustle .
it doesn' t make any sense .
how could that thing beat me ?
nobody cares about a stupid street race .
i care .
i' m a nextel cup series champion who got beat by a volkswagen bug .
yes .
you' re a champion on the track , where it counts .
this is nothing !
the reporters get some laughs out of it .
by thursday , everybody will forget it happened .
i' ve been up all night going over this race .
i outclassed him on every front .
i want a rematch .
aw , jeez .
trip , no .
it' s me , your brother .
forget it .
a two day racing event where i beat all comers and then destroy that little bug .
i want posters at every garage , body shop and auto parts store , and full page ads in the local rags .
how do you know this maxx guy would show up ?
maxx is a racer .
he' il show .
i' m gonna exterminate this bug .
hey .
where you been ?
look at this .
i want to show you something .
huh ?
21 80 engine .
dual weber carburetors .
front , rear swing axles .
pretty sweet , huh ?
yeah , they' re , um ...
wow .
you really put a lot of thought into this .
there' s potential in this car .
we can turn him into a champion .
it' il take work , but , uh , there' s a race in lancaster in a few weeks .
whoa .
hold on a second .
the other day was great .
i don' t know how it happened , but it was a fluke .
you loved being back behind the wheel .
yeah , i did , but now i' m moving to new york and i' m starting a new life and ...
how are you gonna move to new york , a city where you take a subway to work ?
listen , i told my dad no more racing , and i ended up lying to him .
the last time that happened , i ended up in the hospital .
note the vicious afterschool special cycle i' m trying to break here .
i need cash for my apartment .
those are the classifieds .
listen , kev , i' m really sorry .
i know , i know .
what about herbie ?
i guess i' il drop off the keys and the number to an exorcist .
what ?
maggie , what happened ?
are you all right ?
i know what you' re thinking .
it' s one race , mags .
one race , ten grand .
that' s a lot of cash .
ok .
we' il split it .
you got rent money to pay .
i got this dump to fix up .
everybody wins .
what do you say ?
maxx ?
magic ]
come on , herbie .
hey !
sorry .
it' s all right .
yeah !
i have been over every inch of this model ten times .
i' ve run all the tests .
there' s no way an ordinary vw engine like this could have smoked yours .
there' s nothing ordinary about this bug .
i don' t know what it' s got under its hood , but i intend to find out .
those guys always use you to get me to do something .
you can' t let them drop us .
it' il break ray' s heart .
no .
it' s gonna break your heart .
when are you gonna open your eyes ?
ray junior is not cut out for racing .
i have held out as long as i can .
bass pro is dropping you .
i' m sorry .
wait a minute , sally .
wait , please .
tell them to hold on until the speedway races .
lf ray doesn' t place , i' m out .
i close up shop .
i' il sell motor oil .
i' il do something .
how long you been standing here ?
long enough .
i sure am glad you' re not part of this .
at ieast i did something right .
why do i feel like we just got sentenced to five to ten ?
i' m gonna go sign us in .
maggie peyton .
haven' t seen you in a long time .
who you here for ?
" ln the way ray " ?
actually , i' m sponsoring maxx .
so , do you like the makeover ?
you can take the car out of the junkyard , maggie , but you can' t take the junkyard out of the car .
how do you know this maxx ?
um , we go way back .
i' d like to meet him .
can you arrange a face to face ?
he' s meditating .
getting in the zone .
sure .
pressure' s getting to him ?
he' s not worried .
he beat you once .
beginner' s luck .
you tell that to yourself at night in your trip murphy pajamas ?
look , you tell maxx i' m really looking forward to the rematch .
oh , hey .
sorry , big fella .
i' m so sick of all this trip murphy cra ...
geez .
hey .
see you later , trip .
i don' t know if i can do this .
time to suit up , maxx .
walking on sunshine ]
walking on sunshine ]
race fans , please welcome our own trip murphy .
we' ve got 200 names up there .
by the end of the day , there will be only one .
yeah !
and that driver will face me , and have a chance to win $1 0, 000 .
let' s race .
ladies and gentlemen , today' s winner goes up against trip murphy tomorrow !
herbie !
vroom , vroom !
let me hear you say " hey , yo !
what a day .
the real wild card here is the enigmatic racer known only as maxx .
questions abound .
who is maxx ?
where did he come from ?
what' s with the helmet ?
gotcha , maxx .
i' ve signed so many autographs , my hand is numb .
guess who wants an interview .
hello ]
how' d you get over here ?
what' s wrong ?
wow .
maggie , you ...
look amazing .
i mean , you know , for someone who changed in a port a potty .
come on .
i know there' s a compliment in there somewhere .
i think i' m losing my mind .
that was my first reaction .
and then i embraced the mystery that is herbie .
she' s too young for you .
i got to tell you ... ... winning definitely suits you .
oh , i got you something .
it' s stupid .
it' s for luck tomorrow .
it' s amazing .
evening .
i hardly recognized you without your camera crew .
i decided to give them the night off .
can we talk ?
alone ?
you ok ?
yeah .
your driver did pretty well , for an amateur .
but he' s got some serious flaws .
take his car , for instance .
the chassis' s too high , and ... ... the aerodynamics are all wrong .
thanks for the tip .
i' il pass it on to maxx .
you know what i can' t figure out ?
why you' re not behind the wheel .
i hear you were a heck of a street racer back in the day .
ancient history .
i doubt it .
it' s in your blood .
your grandfather was one of the greatest drivers to ever hit the track .
he' s why i got into racing .
and i gotta believe it' s hard wired into your dna .
your dad ought to get ray out of 56 and put you behind the wheel .
how many women drivers have won a nascar championship ?
well ...
it only takes one person to blaze a trail .
ever think that you might be the next great peyton ?
thanks for the props , but i gotta go .
you want to see how it feels behind the wheel of a real car ?
are you serious ?
i doubt your old man is gonna make you the same offer .
go on .
it' il be our little secret .
nice car ]
ok , bug .
let' s see what makes you tick .
there' s no way you could beat me with this engine .
ooh !
you want a piece of me ? !
who' s laughing now ?
huh ?
that was unbelievable !
she' s a pretty sweet ride .
i' ve never driven anything like it .
that was my most awesome driving experience .
amazing what a real car can do , isn' t it ?
i got a little proposition .
why don' t we raise the stakes .
my car for your car .
let' s make tomorrow' s race for pinks too .
huh ?
i don' t know .
i mean , herbie' s really special .
come on .
nobody' s gonna take you seriously in that thing .
now , if , uh , you drive home in trip murphy' s stock car , your dad would be an idiot not to put you on the team .
what do you say ?
for pinks ?
all right .
you just better hope your boy maxx is on top of his game tomorrow .
ray , if you drank all the orange juice , i' il kill you .
mag wheels !
charisma !
why aren' t you in france ?
ugh !
paris was a drag .
i couldn' t understand anybody .
and hello !
learn to pick up after our poodles .
i thought i' d come back to start our road trip early .
slight problem .
i promised i' d meet a friend in the desert .
why ?
are you burying a body ?
no , he' s in a racing tournament .
you think you' re clever , but i see through you .
you can ?
it' s obvious .
you' re dating him .
ok , if you say so .
don' t be coy .
what' s his name ?
ls it serious ?
maxx .
you know , we' re so close , it' s like we' re the same person .
what are you doing ?
where have you been ?
ln a nightmare where my dad , brother and best friend showed up .
well , you got a new problem .
herbie' s freaking out .
i don' t know what to do .
stop it !
did you leave him alone with trip ?
hey , maggie !
who' s that ?
keep her away from my dad .
and she thinks i' m dating maxx .
just don' t ask me to explain .
five minute warning .
get suited up .
and have a heart to heart with your car .
ok ?
yeah .
sure .
where you been ?
excuse me .
i' m kevin !
you must be charisma , yes ?
good to meet you .
i just came back .
i had the worst time ...
herbie .
what' s going on ?
i don' t have time for this now .
we need to beat trip .
just get a grip .
you' re a car .
you do what i tell you to do , all right ?
boo !
it' s winner take all at the
trip murphy sudden death showdown .
maxx decimated his challengers yesterday , but now he' s up against superstar trip murphy !
and now here comes maxx and herbie to the starting line .
blow his wheels off , maggie !
i mean , maxxie !
come on , herbie !
he' s pulling ahead !
that' s it , herbie .
come on !
i want that stock car !
what ?
oh !
stupid car !
you blew this on purpose !
you were supposed to help me !
the voice is more high pitched than i might have imagined .
come on , maxx .
take off the helmet and show everybody who you really are .
it' s a chick !
that ain' t a chick !
that' s maggie !
i guess i was wrong about you .
you' re not the next great peyton after all .
you' re just another amateur who choked in the clutch .
mags !
maggie .
hey .
hey , come on .
come on .
stop this .
you had a bad day .
that' s it .
ok ?
come on .
let' s get out of here , take herbie back to the garage .
there' s always another race .
there' s not .
kevin , it' s over .
i should have never done this in the first place .
that' s ...
hey .
whoa .
get away from him !
hold it , buddy !
take it easy .
ok .
all right !
easy !
wait a minute .
maggie didn' t tell you ?

payback time , bug .
i can' t believe you were pulling a racer x on everybody .

we' re down to the final few spots to see who gets into the big race .
we' re down to the final few spots to see who gets into the big race .
one lap to go for ray peyton , jr . in the 56 car .
it' s gonna be close .
let' s see if ray peyton , jr . can qualify for sunday' s nextel cup race .
come on , ray !
whoo !
yeah !
oh , my god .
peyton .
to the right .
he needs to be transferred .
ray , you ok ?
i' m fine .
i keep telling everybody .
can we please get out of here ?
i' m fine !
jeez !
i guess that means he' s not totally fine .
no .
come here , ray .
come on .
ow !
doc , i' m fine .
look straight ahead .
i see it .
it' s ...
now it' s bright .
there' s a problem with his left eye .
his depth perception is off .
we won' t know the extent of the problem until we run tests .
bottom line , he can' t race sunday .
dad , i' m sorry .
hey .
it' s not your fault .
you ran great today .
i' m gonna go see the doctor .
wait a minute , dad .
i still qualified .
all we need is another driver and we got a shot .
let maggie race .
yeah , ray .
it' s a good idea .
i mean , team peyton needs this race .
she' s ready , sir .
she' s really good .
no .
that' s not gonna happen .
dad !
dad , i' m sorry i lied to you , ok ?
but all i' ve ever wanted to do is race .
you' re not getting behind the wheel .
because i' m a girl ?
i' ve had one crash .
ray' s had dozens !
it' s different !
the only difference is your support !
what' s really your problem with me racing ?
because you' re the spitting image of your mom .
and ...
i can' t lose her twice .
dad , i may look like her on the outside ,
ok , but on the inside , i' m you .
i' m a peyton .
racing is in my blood .
please , let me race .
i can' t .
i' m sorry .
i got it .
ok .
all right .
fine .
bye .
i have bad news .
i just got off the phone with my supplier .
they' re not gonna give me parts until i pay my overdue bills ,
which you need money to do .
so you can' t fix herbie ?
i ...
shouldn' t you be in bed ?
mags , i' m not blind .
i just can' t race .
but you can .
you' re taking my space tomorrow .
well , wait .
what about dad ?
dad always says i should be a team leader .
i called rest of the crew .
they agree .
you' re the one .
look , we got a lot to do if we wanna get my car ready to race .
there' s one car i' m gonna drive .
he' s sitting over there .
you serious ?
i race in herbie , or i don' t race at all .
working for the weekend ]
i' m with trip murphy , nextel cup series champion .
the prevailing wisdom in the press box is that your only worry is you don' t have enough shelf space for a fourth championship .
tell the boys thanks for the support .
but it' s a tough track .
it' s a 500 mile race .
there are some competent drivers out here .
jeff gordon' s a decent driver .
there' s an outside shot he could win .
i guess what i' m saying is , it' s a ... ... long race and anything can happen in this sport .
we love you , trip !
i thought you told me you destroyed that car .
i' m sorry , dude .
hey , trip .
i know you' re gonna win , but on the microscopic chance she beats you again ,
i' ve set up a slim fast " big loser " campaign .
so there' s that .
he' s mad at me .
he' s mad at me .
hates me .
he hates us both .
never seen a bug with a spoiler .
don' t touch .
soft top on a racecar .
i like that .
i like that .
this car just winked at me .
a racecar winked at you .
i swear .
the car winked at me .
are you feeling ok ?
ls it the pressure ?
i' m fine !
fine .
no problem .
i' m telling you , it just winked at me .
hey , kev .
hey .
could we get a second alone ?
you and ... ?
herbie .
of course .
hey , guys .
ray ?
augie ?
let' s give the lady some space , huh ?
sure .
thanks , guys .
you nervous ?
it' s good to be nervous .
keeps you alert .
i just want to say , in the spirit of honesty ,
i did total a car once when i was racing .
that was a long time ago .
hey , um ...
thanks for not giving up on me .
all right .
ready to do this thing ?
cool .
let' s show them what we got .
here we go , herbie .
this is it .
maggie peyton . ls that right ?
that' s what i' ve got too .
so it' s maggie peyton in # 53 for team peyton in a last minute ruling by race officials .
what ?
come on .
you' ve tried to think of a way to sell gear to women for years .
it says she calls the car herbie .
i' ve never heard of a vwbug racing nascar , but team peyton found a loophole .
go , maggie !
what are you doing ?
you go , girl !
whoo !
go , maggie , go !
ladies and gentlemen , rise for our national anthem .
here we go .
go get ' em .
thanks .
ls this what you dreamed it' d be like ?
yeah .
i mean , i wanted my dad here cheering me on , but ...
yeah .
there' s something i want to say to you .
i guess i underestimated you guys .
good luck out there today .
thanks , trip .
word to the wise : it gets pretty nasty out there .
uh , trip , we got a race .
let' s go !
let' s go !
don' t listen to him .
he' s trying to get inside your head .
kev , let' s go .
all right .
so , you wanted to tell me something .
yeah ...
i was gonna say , don' t cut your turns too tight .
got it , chief .
ok .
let' s go !
drivers , start your engines !
we' ve got the makings of a great race today .
beautiful weather and a great field of cars as they head out for their two pace laps .
we anticipate a record crowd .
fans have come to see which driver will hoist the nextel cup trophy .
great stories bookend this field .
trip murphy , star of the season , will lead the field to the green flag from pole position .
then there' s maggie peyton , starting last .
we' il see if she has what it takes and if herbie has a good enough engine .
the pace car is off , the green flag is out , and we' re underway here at california speedway !
those guys are fast !
looks like the 53 car got left in the dust .
there is a minimum speed .
she better get going or get a black flag .
come on , herbie .
we' re not out of this yet .
come on , mags .
go !
rookie jitters or a mechanical problem , but maggie peyton' s barely hanging on now .
ok .
let' s go get dale !
herbie starts to gain ground .
here' s peyton drafting up to dale jarrett in the 88 .
wait .
i don' t think herbie' s drafting .
i think he' s literally attached to # 88 .
that little car' s riding my bumper !
come on , dale , shake her off !
hang on !
come on , maggie .
here we go !
ready ?
what a move !
maggie just did a slingshot on dale jarrett to move past # 88 .
yes !
go , mags !
unorthodox , but it put her back in the race .
i bet her granddad' s smiling at that one .
we' re back in it .
who' s running first ?
trip has junior by 2 lengths .
roll on down the highway ]
come on , mags !
best pit stop of the day for team peyton .
that keeps them in the hunt .
got a hungry pack chasing the leaders .
tony stewart , jeff gordon , mike bliss , all after the top spot .
maggie peyton and herbie come up on the outside .
eighteen laps to go in one of the most surprising races in nascar history .
trip murphy in # 82 is in front .
but can he hold the lead in the final laps ?
here we come .
herbie , we gotta find an opening !
we' il make a move on turn three .
they' re boxing us in .
three wide behind the leaders !
labonte low , peyton in the middle !
peyton takes a shot from gordon and one from labonte .
and now one from kasey kahne !
herbie' s getting pounded in this pack !
i' m getting killed .
can' t shake them !
yes , you can .
you can do this , sparkplug .
dad ?
buckle down and grit your teeth .
come on , magpie .
you' re the next great peyton .
time for everyone to know it .
thanks , dad .
look at that .
now what ?
any suggestions ?
gas it .
gas it right now !
huh ?
there' s running over competition , but never done like that !
yeah !
yah hah !
oh ho !
yeah !
uh oh .
we' ve got a new problem .
herbie' s losing oil pressure ... fast !
looks like the 53' s leaking oil on the track .
we' re coming in .
kevin , it' s sally .
what' s going on with # 53 ?
did you drive here ?
yeah .
why ?
here comes the caution flag .
everyone to the pits .
team peyton may be out of the race with that oil leak .
that stunt you pulled almost cost us the race !
take care of the car and let me drive .
can i make two suggestions ?
not now , larry !
not a perfect fit , but it' il have to hold !
how bad is it ?
it might hold for 5 laps .
it might hold for one .
either way , avoid being slammed around out there !
listen .
you raced your heart out there today , herbie .
but if we keep going , that might be it for you .
forever .
sorry .
i' d rather lose this race than lose you .
whoa !
oh !
are you sure ?
i can' t believe it .
maggie peyton and herbie are getting back on the track !
for a car , you' re not a good listener .
ok , herbie .
let' s finish this .
where is she , crash ?
the bug !
where' s the bug ?
focus on the win !
the fans are pulling for rookie driver maggie peyton , in a car she calls herbie .
attagirl .
nice move .
now go get ' em , maggie !
peyton on an incredible rally , passing them left and right .
now up to second place , behind trip murphy .
amazing !
come on .
did you miss us ?
this girl' s really beginning to tick me off .
2 laps to go in a two car race .
trip murphy and maggie peyton will settle this between them !
go , maggie !
all right !
we' ve got him now !
on the outside !
go high , herbie .
come on , herbie .
we' re almost there .
door to door off the corner at the final ...
contact !
murphy slams into the side of peyton !
mags , don' t push it .
mags , herbie can' t take it .
forget the bug and win !
you' re going down , bug !
trouble in turn four !
murphy into the wall and upside down !
ok , herbie , you ready ?
keep it steady !
ahh !
no place to go !
look out for the crash !
herbie' s ...
herbie' s on the fence !
herbie' s on the fence !
oh !
oh , god !
maggie peyton won !
maggie peyton has won !
incredible !
unbelievable !
i' ve never seen anything like this in nascar , not to mention the birth of the next great peyton !
we did it .
let' s go !
whoo hoo !
whoo !
yes !
i' m so proud of you !
thanks , dad .
maggie , that was awesome !
thank you .

congrats .

i' m telling you !
that car is alive !
look !
it' s doing it again !
you gotta believe me !
you gotta believe me !
this isn' t the end , bug !
i' m going to get you , bug !

he' s fine .
he' s fine .
just a little dehydrated .
wow .
gotta say , peyton , you and herbie make a great team .
