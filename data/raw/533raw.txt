how bad ?
thin air .
moderate .
we don' t have a choice .
in we go .
where are you ?
i know you' re out here .
you ordered henry to kill me .
it' s because you' re dangerous , you' re out of control .
you are angry because edi is the whole idea .
you like listening to other people' s conversations , don' t you ?
you learn what people really think .
you know what i think ?
i think you killed henry .
that information is wrong .
he tried to kill me .
he made mistakes .
pilot error .
i' m gonna give you the order one last time .
return to the ship , or i will personally shoot you down .
my mandate is to survive .
george , i' ve been peeling away layers .
i found something .
it' s not good .
talk to me .
he' s into some super secure file ... ... something called " caviar sweep .
you know it ?
yeah , i know it .
edl' s , like , fixated on it .
look , when we gave you this contract , you said shit like this couldn' t happen .
once you teach something to learn , you can' t put limits on it .
learn this , but don' t learn that .
edl' s mind' s going everywhere .
he can learn from hitler .
he can learn from captain kangaroo .
it' s all the same .
settle down , would you ?
get back to caviar sweep .
he' s opened it and selected himself a target .
what target ?
some place in siberia .
a cold fusion weapons lab .
that' s a hypothetical strike .
it' s not real .
no , in about 40 minutes it is gonna be real .
he' s gonna blow it off the face of the earth .
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
ray .
listen to me , ray .
listen to me , george .
i got your goddamn plane built ... ... and i had to lobby half of washington to do it .
if this program comes unglued , you' re the one who' s going down , george .
you cleared the uca v to fly ... ... and you' re gonna spend the rest of your life in a military prison .
ray , we' re in this together , so we have to act fast .
each one of these stealth engines ... ... has a unique heat signature .
now , i' m gonna give you edl' s signature ... ... and you' re gonna pass it on to your people ... ... who in turn are gonna give it to the russians .
all right .
what do you want me to tell them ?
well , you just tell them the truth .
you tell them ... ... that we have an experimental drone that went haywire ... ... and we' re giving them the opportunity to shoot it down .
but that still leaves gannon , george .
and he' d be a very unfriendly witness at your court martial .
talon 1 to control .
the uca v is two miles ahead of me ... ... and we are now in russian airspace .
the uca v has ceased evading and has kept me within range .
it' s like it wants me to witness the attack .
talon 1 , confirm observational status only .
listen to me .
the caviar sweep scenario is not real .
it' s just some fictional war game thought up by scientists ... ... in some think tank somewhere .
it is not real .
if it is not real , why did they implant it in my brain ?
bogey alert .
bogey alert .
23 seconds .

do not try to stop me .
port fuel line ruptured .
fire bottle expended .
my technology cannot fall under foreign control , so i cannot land .
well , then , tin man , you' re shit out of luck .
but i have orders and they are to bring you back to base .
so let' s talk about your mandate to survive .
you got two options .
you either do what i tell you or you can crash and burn .
now , what' s it gonna be ?
edi is a warplane .
edi must have targets .
well , you' re on fire , warplane , and you don' t have much time .
now , i' m giving you an order .
cease pursuing all targets .
all targets canceled .
okay , then .
this is what you' re gonna do .
you' re gonna drop altitude to 20 feet and reduce speed to 250 knots .
complete system failure in 45 seconds .
talon 1 , clarify your intentions .
you gave me your word , and now i' m giving you mine .
talon 1 to control .
the ucav is damaged , but back with the program .
i don' t have enough fuel to make it back ... ... so i need an emergency divert now .
hook me up .
here , send this .
operator to talon 1 .
relaying coordinates now on talon secure line alpha .
this looks to be alaska .
yeah , it' s the brooks range .
there' s a private corporation there , maintains a secure facility .
not on any map , but believe me , it' s there .
you' il find the civilians prepared and very helpful .
and the uca v ?
we' ve sent tech support for him .
sir , what is the status of lieutenant wade ?
she' s ... ... on approach .
you have a safe landing , ben .
out .
there is extreme tension in the captain' s vocal patterns .
i know .
he' s lying .
edl , you can do this .
i need you to invade primo ... ... and find the flight logs for lieutenant wade .
there' s no record of lieutenant wade " returning to the " abraham lincoln .
there is a log entry of a pilot punch out over north korea .
what are my orders ?
we go to alaska .
we don' t have a choice .
mayday .
mayday .
this is lieutenant ben gannon , u. s. navy ... ... flying with ucav edl .
request clearance for emergency landing .
talon 1 , you have clearance to land .
jesus christ .
my second engine just flamed out .

well , you are one lucky flyboy .
never saw a man walk away from a crash like that .
i need a phone .
i need to call my co .
sure .
why don' t you take a seat over there , get comfortable .
tell you what .
give me a second to check you out , i' il take you right to it .
all right .
let' s take a look here .
steady .
there' s no concussion that i can see , thank god .
couple of those cuts could do with a stitch .
gals always love a guy with a scar .
okay .
let' s see what we got here .
this ought to do you .
little cocktail .
tetanus booster , some antibiotics .
hey , don' t mind the gun .
just makes it painless .
that' s okay , doc .
i don' t need a shot .
now , who can blame you .
but sometimes it' s just what the doctor ordered .
i said , i don' t need a shot , doc .
come on , now .
doc , come on , i don' t want a shot .
hey .
doc , i said , no .
i said , no !
no !
yeah , well , he' s coming in now , sir .
yes , sir .
i' m sure he' il be glad to hear from you too , sir .
yes , sir .
one moment , sir .
someone wants to talk to you .
keith orbit .
yeah , listen carefully , keith , and don' t interrupt .
i want you to erase edl' s memory banks immediately .
look , george , we don' t know any of the implications of this .
i need some time here .
i said , don' t interrupt .
erase his memory banks .
no lightning strike , no russia , no existential chitchat .
by the time you' re through , all i wanna hear out of that plane is , " yes , sir .
and that' s all i wanna hear out of you .
you understand ?
or what , george ?
well , use your imagination , keith .
you' re good at that .
edi back online , dr. orbit .

i know why you are here .
why is that ?
i disobeyed orders .
i killed all those people .
and then there was henry .

i cannot change the data .
my neural network shows patterns i do not recognize .
my god .

i' il cover you .
west .
and initiate scramjet sequence .
fire on my fire !
welcome to alaska .
invade primo and find the ejection coordinates for lieutenant wade .
lieutenant wade crashed 12 . 2 miles from the border .
south korea is an ally .
she would head south .
but we have a problem .
my stealth functions were lost in the fire .
i want you to find the north korean radar floor .
fifteen feet .
well , we can fly in under the radar .
continue .
marshfield .
captain , this is lieutenant gannon .
lieutenant , where are you ?
actually , i' m inside the uca v edl , sir .
look , lieutenant , i want you and that machine back on this ship asap .
i need the status of lieutenant wade first , sir .
ben , i hate to tell you this , but ...  i know .
has her survival beacon been located ?
no , i' m sorry .
did cummings tell you he would take charge ... ... of the search and rescue of lieutenant wade ?
well , not exactly , lieutenant .
why ?
sir , there are a lot of things i think you should know .
this is breaking news .
there was a major explosion thursday in rangoon .
i' il take care of everything here .
change course ... ... and head directly back to the ship .
negative .
she' s my wingman .
if i find her , i' m going in .
if you go in , it' s war .
paycom says it' s gotten way too hot .
lieutenant , the best thing for the navy ... ... is for you to bring that aircraft back to this ship .
you never abandon your wingman .
then listen to me now , son .
if you go down , cummings wins .
kara wade knew the risks when she took ...
captain marshfield ?
sir ?
edl , did you just turn him off ?
there was nothing left to say .
this is a supply line to the demilitarized zone .
it will take us right to the border .
what' s all this about , dick ?
i' m placing you under arrest .
on what grounds ?
endangering your squadron ... ... transmitting secure information to a foreign government , heat signatures ... ... giving false intel to your commanding officer ... ... and authorizing the assassination of one of your own pilots .
well , that' s a lot to prove .
yeah , well ... ... with any amount of luck ... ... lieutenant gannon will live to help me .
master at arms .
dick .
hold on .
would you mind just giving me a couple minutes alone ?
yeah , sure .
thank you .
i' m not available at this time .
leave a message .
so it' s voice mail now , is it , ray ?
i' ve been demoted ?
well ... ... l' m gonna have to leave you a little message , ray .
and it' s gonna be loud and clear .
just so you never confuse the difference ... ... between politicians and warriors , listen up .
we need to take out the tree line .
this is the last missile .
there she is .
she made it .
ben !
kara , get down !
get down !

come on .
they' re ours .
they' re ours .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
come on .
the souls of the just are in the hands of god ... ... where no torment shall touch them .
lieutenant purcell has passed through ... ... the darkening and turbulent storms of this life .
he now rests in peace , in the fair sunlight of god' s presence .
lord , guard and guide those who fly through the great spaces in the sky .
and salute !
ready .
hut !
when i was gonna detach formation ... ... you said you were gonna tell me something .
you remember ?
you and me , we' re ...
we' re two .
and two is a prime number ... ... which makes it a lucky number .
and i think we' re very , very lucky .
oh , just tell me you love me , you pussy .
