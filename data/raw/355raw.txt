for hundreds of years in japan there has lived a clan ... ... who have dedicated themselves to to a secret art of self defence ... and survival .
the art is so lethal that it has made the clan invincible .
to this day , we are known as ... ... ninjas .
twenty five years ago ... ... an ancient legend of this sacred art came alive .
it spoke of a foreign child who would come among us ... ... and become a ninja master like none other .
how he arrived on our shores ... ... will forever remain a mystery .
we ninjas thought that this child ... ... would be the great white ninja of the legend .
we were wrong .
we were very wrong .
haru !
haru .
gobei .
i need your honest opinion about something .
yes , sensei .
what do you think of haru ?
i love my brother .
his heart' s iike a flower .
his determination' s iike a tiger .
he' s fat , a fooi and an embarrassment to ninjas .
today , i am proud to be your sensei .
this is that speciai time when i can say to you ... ... you are a ninja .
you can communicate with other ninjas ... ... by projecting yourself onto the plane of enlightenment .
remember ... ... on this plane ... ... which can be shared by no other mortal ... ... we can always contact each other wherever we may be .
as a ninja ... ... you are one with the universe .
aii of you who are graduating today ... ... wiii receive the medailion of the tengu warrior .
however , i give the golden medailion to my finest student .
gobei .
forged in the fires of confidence and discipline .
carry it with you always .
sorry , haru .
congratulations , big brother .
wait !
sensei , wait for me !
sensei , i am so excited about tonight .
i have been waiting for such a iong time !
tonight' s exercise is for the ninjas only .
but your job is an important one .
you are to remain here to protect the viilage ... ... and guard the dojo .
i shaii do as you say .
i shaii protect the viilage and guard the dojo .
and i shaii water the plants .
good iuck .
good iuck .
stay iow so as not to be detected .
good iuck , my brother .
do not try it .
are you communicating with me ?
are you communicating with me ?
heilo ?
excuse me .
is this the takagure dojo ?
i' m sorry .
this must be the wrong place .
no !
please do not go .
i mean ....
yes , this is the takagure dojo .
oh , thank goodness .
let me take your ... ... shoes .
thank you .
i was told that i could find a ninja here .
reaily ?
please , sit .
wait !
thank you .
that' s very impressive .
so are you a ninja ?
yes , i am .
but you' re white .
you' re observant , as weii as beautiful .
i didn' t expect to find a white ninja .
do not be fooled by my skin colour .
have you heard of the white child who wiii be the greatest ninja master ?
is that you ?
some say it is so .
you see , it is written in this holy writ .
this holds the teachings of aii ninjutsu ... ... that have been passed down over five centuries .
in this is a iegend about a great white ninja ?
you see here : " in the 1 6th century there came to pass
it' s the wrong writ .
this is about the sensei and twin geishas .
also a good iegend ... ... but not the one we were iooking for .
here is my iegend . " it' s told that a foreign child wiii come ... ... and become a ninja master iike no other .
it' s burning .
the words are seared into my soul .
it' s reaily on fire !
yes , i can teil
they may have a second copy .
please teii me why you have come to my dojo .
i warn you that what i' m asking might be dangerous .
danger is my companion .
miss ... ?
saily .
saily jones .
i am haru .
do not worry about haru .
this ninja knows no fear .
you see , i' m a trained master in aii the weapons of battle .
that rack was not built by ninjas .
this , however , was .
luck is with me ... ... for this sacred shrine holds the ashes ... ... of our failen ninja warriors .
sensei is going to kiii me !
takure .
master go .
tampo ?
kai ?
i think they worked as a team .
teii me why you are in need of a ninja .
ninjas can get into places without being seen .
what i need requires great stealth .
you are in iuck .
my highest grades were in stealth .
here' s an example .
close your eyes , turn around and count to nine .
when you open them , i wiii be gone .
one , two ... ... three , four ... ... five , six ... ... seven , eight ... ... nine .
heilo ?
here i am .
saily jones , i accept your dangerous mission .
oh , that' s great .
thank you .
here' s my problem .
i' m seeing this man .
you have a man friend .
i' m suspicious of him .
he' s seeing another woman .
i think it' s bigger than that .
i' ve discovered he has a meeting tomorrow .
exceilent .
you too should be a ninja .
find out what he' s up to .
his name' s martin tanley ... ... and he has a iimo with this iicense plate number .
3 5 1 0 2 .
where shaii i contact you ?
it' s important that you don' t contact me .
i' ii contact you before i ieave .
whatever you wish .
i' ii foilow your boyfriend , saily .
my eyes are iike the tentacles of a squid .
good .
i guess .
thank you .
yes !
i got you .
good morning , mr. tanley .
nobu .
it' s aii set .
they' ii meet us here .
let' s have a iook at it .
oh , yes .
it' s a perfect counterfeit .
one we can duplicate 1 0 miilion times .
martin tanley , attack me with your front gate ... ... i come in the back door .
oh , yes .
they are beautiful .
i have some bad news .
what ?
the plates are for only one side of the biil .
excuse me ?
the plates are in los angeles .
why ?
i don' t know .
you' re paid to know .
i arranged to get this set of plates .
i just paid a miilion doilars for one side of a 1 0, 000 yen biil .
what good does that do me ?
no good .
never take a job you can' t complete .
i' m sorry i posed as a ninja , but this woman needed my help .
it' s you who needs help .
the police believe a ninja committed a murder .
believe me , sensei , i kiiled no one .
i do believe you , haru .
but i' m worried .
don' t worry about me .
the woman' s in trouble .
is it iikely that this woman hired you ... ... so she could blame someone for this murder ?
she' s incapable of such things .
she is as iovely as a dove .
it sounds to me you are being ied around by your short sword .
gobei cailed her hotel .
there' s no one named saily jones .
a woman such as you described had the name alison page .
perhaps she gave a false name .
perhaps she gave you the false name .
believe me .
this woman' s teiling the truth .
you are unable to teii truth from untruth .
impossible .
my ninja intuition teils me this .
you don' t have ninja intuition , or even normai intuition .
my feelings teii me saily jones is in trouble .
i must protect her in america .
what makes you think you can find her in america ?
i have this .
i must go to the hiils of beverly , and save saily jones .
and prove , once and for ail , that i am the great white ninja .
i wiii miss you .
goodbye .
goodbye .
gobei , i' ve always iooked up to you , and you' ve always iooked out for me .
but now i' ii iook out for myself .
be carefui in your travels .
the world is dangerous .
thank you , big brother .
though i think it is wrong for you to make this journey ... ... i want you to take this .
use them only for necessities .
believe in yourself , my son .
i know you wiii succeed .
thank you , sensei .
there is no better father that a boy could have had .
go , haru .
wait !
wait up !
goodbye , everyone !
i' m going to miss him .
no , you wiii not .
because you are going with him .
no !
please !
anything but that !
goodbye , my family !
see you !
don' t worry
you' ii be his shadow .
no one can know you are helping him ... ... especiaily haru .
goodbye , everyone !
i' ii take your bag .
empty your pockets , please .
i am sure you' d iike to know who i am and what i do .
but as part of my creed , i cannot teii you .
my identity must remain mysterious and my mission secret .
i cannot reveai it to you .
why not ?
because i would then have to kiii you .
daddy !
daddy , he said he was going to kiii me !
what' d you say ?
i was relating to the child the importance
that' s it .
grab it .
thanks , asshole !
you are welcome .
what happened ?
the plates were taken by the gang , kobudosai .
i want them back .
it' s being arranged .
but it' s delicate , not iike in japan .
nobu , this is beverly hiils .
everyone' s delicate .
that' s why crooks iike me are respected .
my dear , how was your shopping ?
good .
share some iunch ?
may i take your bag ?
thanks , asshole .
you' re welcome , sir .
you see , sensei , it is aii coming together .
seventy three minutes to deliver two suitcases and a garment bag .
do you have an explanation ?
i seem to be coming down with a mild case of tunnei carpai syndrome .
i think it' s from carrying heavy garment bags .
i don' t want to go on disability and sue the company for miilions .
so i figured i would just pace myself .
mr. washington , everything you do irritates me .
i' m gonna go soak my wrists .
may i help you , sir ?
yes .
i am iooking for a saily jones .
i' m sorry .
i don' t see that name in my computer .
now , if you' ii excuse me .
is the cost of your iodgings great ?
compared to what ?
a hut in a rice paddy ?
we' re a five star hotei with 800 rooms booked six months in advance .
i have money .
i' m sure you do .
unfortunately , we don' t take wampum .
do you take gold ?
front !
perhaps i shaii send dom perignon to your room ?
i prefer to be alone tonight .
perhaps iater i' ii meet your friend don .
1 a.
my wrists !
what you got in here , car radios ?
here you go , sir .
welcome to the rodeo plaza hotel .
what are you ?
a spy or something ?
a spy ?
a spy is iike a gnat compared to a ninja .
ninja ?
you' re a ninja ?
get out of here !
you' re a ninja !
yes , i am a ninja .
i took karate iessons .
i' m not as advanced as you .
i' m a tangerine belt , orange belt .
i' m one of them citrus colours .
you know ?
very admirable .
then perhaps you' ii know ... ... what these are .
man , that was dope !
are you a third degree black belt ?
my black belt is iike the inside of a coffin ... ... on a moonless night .
that' s pretty black .
it is a black art .
and i , haru , am the blackest of the black .
or , actuaily , the great white , black art ... ... blackest master .
hey , man .
do you know what i do every day ?
no .
what ?
i' m running .
i' m always running .
my neighbourhood' s bad .
i run to get cigarettes , to take out the trash .
you know why ?
whenever i ieave my house ... ... somebody' s waiting to kick my ass .
show me a iittle of what you know .
a kick or a jab .
something .
if i do , give me your solemn promise ... ... not to question my authority .
no problem , man .
i went to catholic school .
aii right then , joey .
i' ii do what i can .
always be on your guard .
always be on my guard .
aii right .
you the ninja .
on my guard .
your foe' s back can quickly become his front .
the technique for ripping a man' s head off ... ... is by using your bare hands .
this requires discipline .
years or decades to achieve .
i suggest that you practise on chickens .
chickens ?
ninja secret .
chickens .
here is what i was iooking for , joey .
a beverly hiils disguise .
something simple and natural , yet subtle and cunning .
you wait here .
i got your back .
you iook iike a pimp .
thank you .
as a pimp , i' ii blend into the city iike msg into miso soup .
it' s time for me to find my dove .
how do we do that ?
she' s rich , beautifui and blond .
how many rich blonds could there be ?
naturai blondes ?
i' m in .
let' s do it .
we are entering a dangerous phase .
a mistake could jeopardize saily' s iife .
so what are you saying ?
i can' t go ?
saily ?
oh , my gosh !
get away from me , you creep !
i thought we was homies .
you' re my boy , my ninja .
we' re iike this .
a ninja master knows best .
you' re questioning my authority .
you' re right .
if you need me , i' ii be at the hotel .
okay .
good work today .
saily ?
saily jones !
i mistook you for a friend of mine .
you iook iike her .
i mean , him .
up close , you don' t iook iike either .
they are twins .
and they ....
this is nice .
excuse me , i have to be going .
thank you .
saily !
saily jones !
it is i , haru !
why are you here ?
you said you needed a ninja .
i' ve come many miles disguised as a pimp to help you .
just go away .
i' ii rescue you .
i don' t need to be rescued .
just ieave .
i see .
very smart .
it is better that you not iet them know i am here .
here , take this .
i discovered your boyfriend is a counterfeiter and a kiiler .
you can be sure he' s cheating on you too .
do not despair .
i wiii be ever vigilant .
i' ii be watching your every move .
making sure that as the
do not be afraid , my dove .
i wiii be watching you .
there you are .
we' ii see who is the hunter and who is the prey , martin tanley .
martin tanley , you have ieft a traii a sloth could foilow .
thanks for meeting us , mr. ozaru .
it' s best we resolve our differences .
perfect agreement .
cut the builshit .
how much for your plates ?
you have it backwards .
the kobudosai wiii buy your plates .
do you think you can waltz in , grab the plates and run the show ?
you don' t have a choice , mr. tanley .
i wiii know .
i wiii do .
i am one with the universe .
holy shinto !
i am one with the universe .
no , i am not ... ... one with the universe !
let' s discuss ... ... how much we' re going to give you ... ... for your plates .
get out !
holy shinto !
help !
police !
no !
no !
i did not do it !
this is the site of a gangland murder in little tokyo .
witnesses say the assailant had tattoos ... ... and may be a ninja .
he matches an interpol description of a man wanted in japan for murder .
come to papa , baby !
keep practising , joey , and some day you wiii choke that chicken .
for pete' s sake .
who is sloppy and messing up ?
getting in the way aii the time .
sensei .
meditate on me , haru , and we' il meet on the plane of enlightenment .
help !
i must concentrate !
i am one with the universe !
here , haru !
i am here .
i hate this !
thank you , sensei .
heilo , my son heilo , sensei .
there' s a problem you are facing .
not reaily .
it' s just that i have been accused of another murder ... ... or two .
come home , haru .
i cannot , sensei .
i need your help finding saily jones .
i' ve considered severai techniques .
i could find the names of aii bmw sales ... ... checking on aii the joneses , then visiting them .
or
you could try a phone book .
a phone book .
then resume your quest .
i wiil , sensei .
you thought , perhaps , an experienced ninja ... ... would not be ready for you .
i am haru of the takagure dojo .
do not forget that .
i am one with the universe !
i am haru of the takagure ....
alison .
heilo , alison .
did martin say when he' d be back ?
no .
that' s strange .
we have business to go over .
it appears saily' s using her false name with these people .
very clever , saily .
you reaily should be a ninja .
there' s something' s wrong here .
i am the only one who is cailing her saily jones .
how could she do this to me ?
do not move , alison ... alison page !
the guards could kiii us both .
you are a iiar , saily ...
saily jones !
i' m sorry that i gave you a false name .
i only did it so tanley wouldn' t know i hired you .
your iies bounce iike ping pong bails .
i am not iying to you , haru .
in fact , you' ve helped me .
you found out what i needed to know .
i did ?
yes .
look .
my sister carla worked for tanley .
she died mysteriously .
i suspected tanley , but i couldn' t prove anything untii you .
but you' re in love with tanley .
i got involved with him to find out about carla .
he doesn' t know i' m her sister !
i cannot teii the truth from the untruth .
there' s no time !
if i find the plates , i' ii get him .
believe me !

chet walters .
i' m told he' s the best .

and then
i am sorry .
i got carried away .

which would you prefer ?
couch is fine for me .
that would be fine for me too .
good night .
good night .
don' t worry , he' s an ink specialist and suspects nothing .

not a ninja technique , but effective .
put him in the back .
what' re you doing ?
the iaughing mushroom .
one pinch and he' ii teii the truth about tanley .
careful , alison .
the effects are profound .
open his mouth .
i' m involved in counterfeiting some money !
big deal !
if i get caught ... ... i could do 30 years .
tanley is a kiiler !
he kiiled her sister .
when he' s done , he' ii probably kiii you !
when are you to meet him ?
ten minutes .
if you' re here when he gets here , he' ii kiii us ail !
i don' t think we should .
i' m sorry .
i was ....
i wasn' t trying to ....
i was merely trying to get close to the temple , not inside .
i just wanted to climb the steps ... ... and maybe peek at the sacred object .
hey , how you doing ?
chet walters .
mr. tanley ?
nice jacket .
who shot the couch ?
very funny , mr. walters .
ready to go ?

here we are , off to the wild blue yonder .
you don' t mind .
a smaii precaution .
no , if you feei more comfortable .
how wiii you drive with that on ?
it' s for you .

caroi channing .
mind if i borrow this next week ?
i got a blind date .
a blind date !
which way' s he going ?
through the grand canyon ?
where did he iearn to drive ?
cooking school ?
thank god we made it !
okay , iet' s take the blindfold off .
that' s what she said .
she said !
you think i ought to work before you pay me ?
it' s the reai biil .
print a proof copy today .
exactly iike this .
no problem .
hold the phone a second .
old faithful !
sure you don' t want it sooner ?
they don' t caii me the best for nothing .
i' m in a thong speedo , hiking boots and a backpack .
you get a ride on 83rd avenue , dressed iike that in the middle of winter .
what happened ?
a bug must' ve bit me .
my brother' s in pest control .
bring him over ... ... he' ii nuke every cockroach and mosquito in this dump .
could we please get to work ?
i see you got the t 200 split ievei barber ink printing press .
i printed ieaflets for the " shave the whale " campaign .
" save the whale .
that' s what you did with them ?
nobu , keep an eye on him .
maybe it was " starve the whales " !
let' s see what we got baking in the oven .
not yet a match .
it iooks iike we are one degree celsius off ... ... on that magenta colour .
i' m gonna have to quantify the 7 f reading on this ... ... and that' d run it through with the surface gravity viscosity .
i can plug it into the marshaii formula ... ... and that would give me an accurate mix design .
they' re just a iittle bit off .
what i could do on that is run a pap smear ... ... and then tone it down a iittle .
heilo , mr. tanley .
what the heii is that ?
see what i' m up against ?
i' ii rethink my inks .
so ... ... what i could do is , i could swing back to my shop ... ... and be gone five minutes .
you could blindfold me .
i iiked that anyway .
how' d that get in there ?
who are you ?
chet walters , ink specialist .
i am haru of the takagure dojo ... ... and if you value your iife , you wiil ....
let' s get him !
open this door !
let us out of here !
haru , you are truly the great white ninja .
did i say ninja ?
i meant ninny . " haru , you are such a ninny .
where' s walters ?
subject me to any torture you can think of ... ... but a ninja does not talk .
ninja ?
you' re a ninja ?
you' re the fat ninja everyone' s talking about .
great white ninja .
the meeting with the kobudosai is arranged .

tie him and throw him in the van .
get rid of him iater .
check your guns .
kobudosai checked theirs .
my dove !
are you aii right ?
i am fine .
let me get this blindfold off .
it is in the spirit of harmony we meet here today .
it is important to our community an agreement be reached .
stop squirming !
i' m undoing these ropes .
a ninja visualizes the straightness of the rope .
it wiii begin to untie itself .
or a knife is good .
i suggest that you make your plates our plates .
honoured elder ?
you know i have great respect for you , kumagi ... ... but i rule in favour of mr. tanley .
you won' t get away with this !
yes , i wiil .
these criminals wiii face the justice system .
be careful .
where' s the ninja ?
i don' t know .
never mind .
that' s right .
the little tokyo temple .
stop the van .

i am on your side .
let' s get him !

alison , what have i done ?
he' s an idiot !
i cannot do this anymore .
i had to escape from jail !
i am coming home .
do not be rash , gobei .

he' s made every mistake in the ninja book .
he is coming .
hide behind those clouds .
i hate this !
heilo , haru .
heilo , sensei .
how are you , my son ?
i have tried , but i have failed .
that is never true .
i want so desperately to be a great ninja iike gobei , but
stop comparing yourself to gobei .
why , sensei ?
he is the best ninja ever .
i hope that he knows that i love him .
aii i wanted was his respect .
my son ... ... we would aii be iucky to have a heart as big as yours .
in fact , gobei wiii not become ... ... a great ninja , untii he iearns that iesson .
i tried to stop this mission because i feared for you .
but i was wrong .
you must continue .
i must ?
yes .
go .
save alison .
it is your duty as a ninja .
you just cailed me a ninja .
yes , i guess i did .
go now .
