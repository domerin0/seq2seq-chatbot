she was truly one of the doomed .
i asked her to come in off the ledge and into my arms .
she asked me why she should bother living .

i was trained to tell her lots of things .
her dreams , all the people who' d miss her .
but for a second , i hesitated .
and she saw it .
within that second , i couldn' t think of one optimistic thing to say to her .
so she spread her arms and jumped .

timothy !
an insanity plea was refused by the court ... ... despite the fact that my client is a certifiable axis iv dissociative .
to this day , he remains unaware of the crimes for which he was convicted .
in 1986 , the supreme court ruled decisively that states cannot execute ... ... a person who does not understand why he' s being put to death .
he signed a confession .
he didn' t just sign it , he dictated it .
thirdly ... ... malcolm' s diaries found misfiled in state evidence .
your honor , this notebook contains entries made just before the murders .
important to note are the spectacular changes in handwriting style ... ... tone , point of view .
what you are looking at are the private thoughts of several different people .
with permission , dr. mallick will elaborate .
thank you .
your honor , there is no universally efficacious treatment ... ... for dissociative identity disorder .
in theory , one attempts to move the patient towards integration .
a folding of their fractured psyche .
your honor ?
he' s here .
no !
what you saw was an accident !
he ran out in front of me !
i' m not a murderer !
there' s a dead body in your freezer , larry .
i didn' t kill him .
i found him like that .
stop it !
listen !
listen !
i was in vegas last month and i lost everything , okay ?
everything !
i drove west .
i didn' t know where to go , but i was running on empty ... ... so i pulled in here at this place .
and there was no one at the station , so i came over to the office ... ... and i walked in .
and there , sitting at that desk right there , was the manager ... ... facedown in a banquet potpie .
dead !
heart attack or something .
banquet potpie !
he' d been sitting there for god knows how long .
all of a sudden , this auto parts salesman pulls up , looking for a room .
i didn' t have a fucking dime ... ... so i took his 30 and gave him one .
i just took the key from the wall and gave him a room .
maybe that was wrong , but i was broke , and that' s what i did .
then i came back in here ... ... and i moved larry' s body his name was larry too .
i put him in the freezer .
i wasn' t trying to hide him .
it was hot out .
i thought it was the best place for him till his family or someone came along .
only no one did ... ... except more guests .
so i checked them in too .
and they all seemed happy ... ... so i just stayed .
cry me a river .
this is a total crock of shit !
no , it' s not !
admit it , you killed him !
just like you killed my con .
just like you killed her husband .
just like you killed his actress .
just admit it .
say it , " i killed them .
stop it !
he can' t take any more !
everything is okay now .
everything is fine .
we got the guy .
it' s fine .
i don' t know what we got .

we thought we got the guy two hours ago , then
you believe this shit ?
it' s him !
it' s this guy !
he had a knife to your neck , remember ?
his story' s so unbelievable , i think it just might be true .
she' s got a point .
you guys are crazy .
maybe it' s the burial ground .
what ?
read the brochure in there .
it' s all around us .
a hundred years ago , the government moved these indians here .
they all died because there was no water .
now they' re coming back to life like sea monkeys , huh ?

you' ve tried to run this show all night .
giving orders , pointing fingers !
you blamed my con for everything , and he ends up dead .
i' m telling you , it' s him !
we all saw him run down george .
your actress' s wallet is right there .
she' s dead , there' s the wallet .
what more do you want ?
stop it !
please shut up !

you want a plan ?
here' s the plan , okay ?
no one' s gonna move .

and if something out there comes in here , i' il shoot it !
and if anyone of us tries anything , i' il shoot them !
we get it .

timmy ?
timmy ?

it' s all right .
remember that movie where the 10 strangers went to an island ... ... and then they all died one by one ... ... and then it turned out they weren' t strangers , they all had a connection ?
they all messed with the wrong guy , and he was getting revenge .

when i was going up the stairs i met a man who wasn' t there
he wasn' t there again today
i wish i wish he' d go away
who is this ?
who am i speaking to right now ?
where did you learn that poem ?
who am i speaking to ?
look at me .
who am i speaking to right now ?
doc ?
edward ?
what' s happening ?
please be quiet .
he can hear what we' re saying ?
of course i can hear what you' re fucking saying .
edward , you missed your last appointment .
where have you been ?
did i black out again ?
try and think back .
where have you been ?
all right .
i was driving this actress ... ... and we got stuck at the motel .
there was a storm .
we couldn' t get out because of the storm .
what happened at the motel ?
people started dying .
and then their bodies it didn' t make any sense .
they disappeared .
edward , i' d like to show something to you , if i may .
do you recognize this man ?
no .
that man , edward , is malcolm rivers .
he' s had a very troubled life .
he was arrested four years ago ... ... and convicted of the murder of six people in a violent rampage .
he did this .
detective , please .
edward , listen to me .
when faced with an intense trauma , a child' s mind may fracture ... ... creating disassociated identities .
that' s exactly what happened to malcolm rivers .
he developed a condition that is commonly known ... ... as multiple personality syndrome .
why are you telling me this ?
because you , edward ... ... are one of his personalities .
what ?
jesus christ !
what the fuck did you do to my face ?
keep calm .
where is my face ?
that is your face .
why am i tied up ?
keep calm .
where is ?
please .
jesus christ !
where is my face ?
stay calm .
no !
i' m not gonna stay calm !
why am i tied up like this ?
who are all these people ?
what happened at the motel ?
where is everybody ?
they don' t exist , edward .
you were all created by malcolm as a child .
you' re a liar !
consider what you know .
everyone named after a state .
no .
everyone sharing the same birthday .
your blackouts .
no !
i was a cop !
i was a cop in the rampart division of l. a. p. d. for six years .
edward , please .
i live in hollywood , in a studio apartment .
you don' t live there .
i do live there !
you don' t live anywhere .
i know this is difficult to accept , but the face you saw in that mirror ... ... is the face i' ve always seen when i talk to edward or paris or larry ... ... or anyone else you' ve met tonight .
malcolm is in the midst of a medical treatment .
one which forces all his identities to confront one another for the first time .
i knew there would be violence ... ... and with it , the number of the identities would be reduced .
reduced ?
one of the personalities you' ve met tonight , edward ... ... committed those murders four years ago .
he took control of malcolm' s body , as you have now ... ... and released an unspeakable rage .
and in 19 hours ... ... malcolm rivers will be put to death because of those actions ... ... unless i can convince that man ... ... that the killer is gone .
i need you to stay with me .
edward ?
i need your help .
i need your help to finish this .
edward , listen to me .
edward , stay with me .
listen to me .
i need you to understand .
the killer cannot survive .
edward !
got it ?
i can' t see a thing .
is there a flashlight ?
hang on .
hang on .
you got a flashlight ?
yeah , yeah , it' s dead .
goddamn it .
shut up !
hey .

ed , you gotta push a little bit .
ed , why won' t you let me help you ?
where did you go before ?
what did you see ?
tell me what you saw .
i saw you .
i saw you in an orange grove .
why won' t you let me help you ?
where did you go ?
what did you see ?
i saw you ... ... in an orange grove .
the question , your honor , is whether to convict the body or the mind .
his body committed these murders , that is true .
the person who remains inside did not .
judge taylor , that may not be true
we witnessed the destruction of 10 identities tonight .
nine were innocent and one was guilty .
they' re not real !
the violence that existed in him has been executed .
your honor , malcolm belongs in a state hospital .
in the matter of rivers v. nevada , it is the recommendation of this court ... ... that mr. rivers ' execution be stayed .
i am transferring mr. rivers to state psychiatric services ... ... under the care of dr. mallick .
cracked heels and washed out horns blow into my face with scorn
but it' s not that way i wasn' t born to lose you
i want you
i want you
i want you so bad
timmy .
no , please don' t .
no , timmy , please .
what is it , malcolm ?
malcolm ?
whores don' t get a second chance .
when i was going up the stairs
i met a man who wasn' t there
he wasn' t there again today
i wish i wish he' d go away
