five people have been killed by an avalanche in france .
everyone on our trip has tried it thousands of times .

there are also dangers to being a cook .

the problem is , i' ve just got to see them on you .
you can change them if it' s too big .
the shop assistant was a man so i couldn' t say you were " about his size " .

a man in the lingerie department .

cille ...

i' ve got to calm down .
i' il go and get a doctor .

no .
horses are for girls .
you' re a boy .
you want something motorized .
maybe i' m gay .
no , you' re not .

you' il just have to wait to come out of the closet till you' re 12 .

yes .

you' il get a horse .
where are your glasses ?

she' s just had a fright .
yes .
niels , i have done an xray .
thanks .
where is stine ?
she' s ok .
she' s fine .
she wasn' t sure she wanted to celebrate this evening .
don' t worry .
i' il see what we can do .
marie ... what happened ?
i didn' t see it .
i only heard the bump .
it wasn' t your fault , marie .
you do know that , don' t you ?
yes .
that' s what the police said , too .
but i didn' t tell them we were going a bit too fast because me and stine were arguing .
that' s not why it happened .
i only heard him .
i didn' t see him .
you couldn' t help it .
will you find out how he is ?
i' il run you home first .
no , i want to know how he is .
i' m afraid it' s really bad .
really bad .
we don' t know for sure .
but it looks really serious .
his girlfriend is sitting in the hall .
yes ... er ... yes .
hello .
hello .
have you time to talk to me ?
just for a moment ?
ls he dead ?
no , i' m just ...
sorry .
i' m not on duty .
ok .
clumsy of me .
sorry .
my wife was driving the car .
your wife ?
yes .
ok ...
so that must have been your daughter ?
yes ... she' il be all right , too .
it' s her birthday .
we' re getting married .
you will .
you think ?
yes .
i' m sure of it .
we' re so terribly sorry this has happened .
lf there' s anything we can do to help ...
ls there anybody at home ?
i don' t have any parents , and joachim' s live in the usa .
look ...
that' s me , and that' s our phone number .
call whenever you feel like it .
can you ask how bad it is ?
they won' t tell me .
i don' t know anything .
that' s because they don' t know anything yet either .
but they would tell me , wouldn' t they ? lf they thought ...
they would tell me ?
yes , definitely .
yes .
with lovely hot chocolate and birthday cake ...
and when she ...
happy birthday , darling !
did you hear that torben' s walked out on birthe and their ugly kids ?
when was that ?
beats me why he stayed so long .
she looked like henry vill .
she even dressed like him .
you' re talking about our friends .
she could have made an effort .
a manicure or the occasional bike ride . ls the sauce all gone ?
i' il get you some more .
are you ok ?
he just had so much blood in him .
was the car damaged ?
finn !
it' s a fair question .
a new car ...
are you sure ?
yes .
what did she say to you ?
she didn' t say anything .
she was afraid and upset .
she asked how you were and also how mum was .
it' s a very typical reaction .
it' s psychological .
ln crises we look after others .
i mean ... women do .
give us a break !
you could learn from it , finn .
why don' t you go get a tattoo ?
don' t be silly , finn !
she' s right .
niels' s dad spent his life working 16 hour shifts .
the only time he was with his whole family was at his funeral .
you can' t accuse niels of the same thing .
he' s got seven kids or however many it is , and they stick to him like warts .
we' ve got three , and that was a lovely way of putting it .
three , then .
it' s just too much .
well , i wouldn' t mind trying for another .
it doesn' t surprise me .
good luck to you !
ls there any more sauce ?
no .
funnily enough , not for you .
there' s a drop left here , finn .
thanks .
would you phone to see how he is ?
shall i phone now ? ...
of course .
what did they say ?
no news .
you' re sure ?
yes .
how long will he be in surgery ?
it could be four or five hours .
when will they phone ?
as soon as they know anything .
how about a toast for stine ?
yes !
you really don' t have to .
of course we do .
this is a no smoking area .
sorry .
good morning , cecilie .
have you had any sleep ?
no , not really .
have a seat .
coffee ?
yes , please .
i could give you a long lecture .
just tell me the truth .
it' s not good .
joachim has broken his neck and his back .
most of his back simply got crushed .
what does that mean ?
it means ...
he' il be able to talk and think .
but that' s all .
does he know ?
not yet .
hi .
hi .
hi , baby .
it' s blown my trip to pelagonia .
yes ...
patagonia ...
yes .
i can' t feel my arms or legs .
it feels really weird .
it' s not a good sign , is it ?
you' il never feel anything again from the neck down .
oh ... but ...
i know it sounds harsh , but you' il never be able to walk again .
i' d like to be left alone for a bit .
we' ve got several psychologists ...
please go now .
i' il leave the two of you .
i' m sorry .
cecilie ... please go .
joachim ...
i really mean it .
i want you to go now .
joachim ...
no , none of that .
i can' t be bothered with it , ok ?
damn it ... all right ?
see you .
joachim ...
cecilie , stop it .
go now , damn it .
i love you .
please go .
stop that .
stop lt !
get out !
yes , we could do that , too .
or send him flowers or chocolates .
but it won' t help him .
can' t he have sex any more , either ?
stine !
it' s pretty important .
to some people , anyway .
no , he can' t have sex either .
maybe i could write to him .
all right .
but it won' t help him right now , or make it easier .
marie , he stepped out in front of your car .
you couldn' t help it .
no .
it wasn' t your fault .
marie , it wasn' t !
things like that happen .
every single day .
and life goes on .
yes , for us .
but not for him .
just think of his girlfriend !
it wasn' t your fault .
you know that , don' t you ?
tell me if there' s anything you want me to bring you from home .
loads of people have phoned to ask if they can come and see you .
are you thirsty ?
you' re going to have to let me in on this .
you' re going to have to let me help you .
i love you .
forever .
hello .
hi .
it' s really nice of you to spare me the time .
of course i do .
how is he ?
well ...
he won' t talk to me .
i know he talks to the nurses .
but when i come he just lies there without saying anything .
and what do you do ?
they say it' s normal .
and that it' il pass .
it is very normal .
and it will pass .
i just don' t get it .
there must be ways ...
they can do all kinds of things .
there must be something .
i wish i could be more encouraging .
but there isn' t even a theoretical chance .
he only has a year left before he gets his m. sc .
we were going to get married .
what is he studying ?
geography .
i' m a cook .
or ...
would you like an apple ?
you' ve got apples ?
a little bag .
for our blood sugar .
for our blood sugar ?
here .
thanks .
has he dumped her or what ?
i don' t know .
her best friend has slept with her boyfriend .
poor stine !
as if she didn' t have enough problems as it was !
i' m lost .
what problems ?
what' s going on ?
she' s not doing well at high school .
or turning up for work at the library .
and i think she' s started stealing .
money keeps vanishing from my purse .
maybe she needs more pocket money .
you' re such an easy touch !
she' s probably upset in general , don' t you think ?
maybe it' s affected her more than she admits ?
what do you mean ?
she knows she made you speed up .
do you think that' s what she thinks ?
i don' t know what to say .
maybe it' s her age .
remember what it was like ?
i was never that age .
no , you weren' t .
shall we just sell her and make a new one ?
no , we can' t .
you have to have sex for that .
i don' t know if you' ve ever heard of it .
sex .
you mean we both have to have it ?
yes .
my goodness ...
what was that ?
i think it was a kiss .
you don' t usually kiss me like that .
yes , i do ...
an idea to be regarded in the light of his new confidence in himself following the incident in the quarry eighteen months ago .
professor , it can' t be that significant that the monument was based on frost ?
will you please shut up ?
i didn' t think you could talk any more .
why are you doing this ?
why ?
why do you insist on humiliating me like this ?
why do you make such a fuss ?
i think you should beat it .
i promise we' il work things out .
ln about two years ' time my legs will start to wither .
they won' t .
my arms will dangle like two lengths of boiled spaghetti .
at some stage they' il have to amputate the whole bloody lot .
all you' il have left will be the dead bit of skin that was once my dick .
stop it !
think about it .
i' m telling you the way it is .
you want to live with that ?
yes , of course i do .
ln that case i think we should get married at once .
you' il be able to spend your wedding night wiping my arse .
do stop it !
cecilie ...
please go .
i mean it .
ln all sincerity .
i can' t .
i can' t just go .
i love you , damn it .
lf i love you enough you' il love yourself one day .
listen to you !
shut your face !
you' ve got to stop listening to all those pop lyrics .
come here ...
lf you love me as much as you keep bragging about you should walk away .
you' il do us both a favour .
stop coming here .
it' s dumb .
get a life .
yes .
right ?
see you around .
it doesn' t have to be like this .
you' re just making everything worse .
it can' t be worse .
it can !
please just go .
now .
cecilie ...
i am on my way .
but i' il be back .
you will not come again .
why take it out on cecilie ?
she hasn' t done anything .
it' d be a fucking good idea if you shut your arsehole and turn on the tv .
by then we' d been through the repertoire several times .
she was jumping up and down on top of me .
and i had to tell her " i just can' t do it any more , honey " .
hello ?
hi .
this is cecilie .
l' m at the hospital .
i was wondering if you had five minutes ?
who was that ?
that cecilie girl .
she wants another chat .
i' d be happy to ...
finn , eat your mackerel .
and she said " i' ve got to have an orgasm too or i' il get a headache " .
ok . , and you said ...
take some aspirin !
then i drove home and watched bridge over the river kwai .
bloody good film , by the way .
finn , eat your mackerel .
see you in a moment .
hi .
hi .
were you nodding off to sleep ?
i was admiring the weather .
breakfast is the most important meal of the day .
i never have breakfast .
oh , right , you' re a cook .
after all , i don' t start my day by ...
no , i don' t suppose you do !
look ...
i used to live ... ... just over there .
ln randers st.
when you were a medical student ?
no , as a boy .
it was my childhood home .
we used to climb over ... ... there used to be a fence .
but you don' t want to hear all this .
i do !
oh , ok .
niels !
niels !
i thought i saw you .
hi , robert , hi sanne .
this is cecilie .
robert and sanne .
hello ...
so this is where you two hang out .
no , cecilie is ...
she was in the car .
when marie and stine ...
and robert sells combine harvesters .
we were airing the twins .
yes , it' s good to get away from the white walls once in a while .
what was all that about ?
that was sanne and robert .
robert is marie' s brother and he' s in combine harvesters .
so you said ... but what came over you ?
i just got confused .
i forgot why we were out here .
and then they showed up .
i' m sorry .
it wasn' t very ...
that' s all right .
it' s ok .
we can take a short cut .
cecilie ?
come in .
he doesn' t want to see you today .
come off it !
he says things ...
he is within his rights .
he doesn' t want to see you .
maybe .
but i have to see him .
joachim ?
i don' t believe it .
we' ve got to ...
you are a fool .
calm down !
i told you to stay away .
i asked you to leave .
yes , but ...
didn' t i ask you to stay away ?
calm down .
i asked you to go .
calm down ...
which book ?
you choose .
ls it for me ?
yes .
i' il put you to bed .
good night , daddy .
daddy' il come in a moment .
niels speaking .
this is cecilie .
hi .
how are you ?
it' s joachim .
i know he' s going through hell but he needn' t be such a bastard .
i' m just as unhappy as he is .
but he doesn' t care .
it' s as if it' s all ... ... my fault .
listen ... calm down .
lt isn' t your fault .
do you hear me ?
shall i come over ?
yes .
right .
mummy !
gustav took my cocoa pops !
give them back , gustav .
get a move on !
stine ?
how much is 20 plus 20 ?
forty .
size forty for a bum is plenty .
gustav !
was that you coming in so late ?
yes , it was me .
where were you ?
at work .
why were you up ?
why weren' t you asleep ?
i couldn' t sleep .
were you with the mishap girl ?
her name is cecilie .
what do you do when you' re together ?
we talk .
ok .
that' s nice .
you don' t think it' s odd ?
no , i don' t .
what are you trying to tell me ?
she' s miserable and i talk to her .
the way i talk to all my patients .
hurry up , gustav .
we' ve got to go .
it may take me ages to finish .
be quiet and eat up , all right ?
does she like talking to you ?
you' re asking for it !
you go on and on .
what are you playing at ?
she' s lost her boyfriend .
you know how that feels , right ?
that wasn' t too good .
no .
she' d only just stopped crying over him .
it was wrong of me , ok ?
but don' t you agree she was insolent ?
it was nothing compared to what she called me yesterday .
i am just tired .
i' ve been at work .
what did she call you ?
an east german dyke .
i was proud of her .
they' re doing the cold war at school now .
stine will have to pay for that plate , won' t she ?
joachim ?
remember this ?
do you ?
joachim , please look at me .
you' re not going to smash me like this .
you' re not .
look at me , joachim !
was that it ?
was that all we had together ?
joachim , look at me , damn you !
my whole life also disappeared that morning .
with you .
please won' t you come back to me ?
won' t you speak to me ?
cecilie ... come along .
ls there anything i can do ?
ls there anything you want ?
beat it .
yes ?
hello ?
cecilie ? ls something up ?
will you come over and hold me ?
yes .
of course .
was that cecilie ?
yes .
what did she want ?
she' s upset , i think ...
should we do something ?
i think she just wants to talk to someone .
she' s at the hospital .
she asked if i' d come over .
can' t you ?
she' s at the hospital all on her own .
all right .
i love you .
hi .
right , what' s happened ?
what' s happened , cecilie ?
nothing .
we' re just going to stand here for a moment .
yes .
cecilie , has something happened ?
no .
we' re just going to stand here a moment .
i' il take the boys to school .
stine doesn' t start till 10 .
ok ... have a nice day .
what' s up ?
showers suit you .
yes .
shall we go to norway at christmas ?
gustav and emil could try skiing .
yes ... but drive stine to school first , all right ?
have a nice day .
good morning , darling .
got out of bed on the wrong side ?
something to do with rolf ?
rolf is a jerk .
his breath smells .
ln that case what' s up ?
why would you care ?
you' re always with the mishap girl .
stine , do you mind ?
are you seeing her ?
just stop it .
lf you go on attacking everyone with all your crap your life will be very difficult .
she' s living at the hospital ?
mum feels the same way .
be nice to her .
she' s losing patience with you .
right .
eat up and i' il drive you to school .
but how long will he go on feeling bitter ?
it varies .
some people take years .
others take months .
some never get over it .
they die bitter and lonely .
nobody can help them .
you can' t help him .
he' s the only one who can .
the only way you can help him is by getting on with your own life .
but he' s doing it for my sake .
no , he isn' t .
he is only thinking of himself .
he' s so sorry for himself that it' s the only thing that matters .
it' s hard .
but you must move on .
it' s fine that you' ve met somebody else .
no need to feel guilty .
no , but it isn' t for real .
he' s married and stuff .
oh , so you can' t fall in love with him ?
i don' t know .
i just want to talk to joachim .
from joachim peterson
hi .
don' t come after all .
i ...
i haven' t done the shopping , anyway .
i want to be alone .
' bye .
hi ...
pizza delivery .
two pizzas for cecilie pagh .
come in .
ls it ok ?
yes , come on in .
wow !
you' ve certainly rearranged the place .
yes .
it' s cosy , don' t you think ?
what have you done with the furniture ?
joachim took it .
he needed it for something .
maybe he thought it was his .
it may also be a way of trying to tell me that there won' t be a wedding .
i don' t know .
maybe there' il be a wedding anyway .
you never know .
are you ok ?
i' m fed up with talking about him .
i talk of nothing but him .
but do sit down ...
you don' t think i should go ?
no , stay .
sit down .
right .
i' il sit over here .
here .
have you cheated on marie often ?
ok ...
no , i must admit i haven' t .
why do you ask ?
have you ever ?
no .
before , i mean ?
before what ?
before this .
no .
not at all ?
no , i haven' t .
never ever ?
never ever .
this is the first time .
ls there anything wrong with that ?
no .
hi .
hi .
what are you doing ?
nothing .
just walking .
listen .
i' ve been thinking .
lt' s no good your not having any furniture .
you must let me buy you a sofa .
may i buy you a sofa ?
wow !
so that' s leather .
it' s leather .
ls it comfy ?
yes .
it really supports your back .
yes , it does .
it' s an incredibly lovely sofa .
we sell lots of them .
but it' s very dark .
haven' t you a lighter model ?
not this one .
we have other sofas that are lighter .
but this one is incredibly practical .
you wipe it with a damp cloth .
and if it tears you can patch it with your trousers .
we' il take it .
i saw something over here , too .
do you only have one of these ?
no , we' ve lots .
we' il take two of them .
two of them .
and ...
we' d like to look at a bed .
ln that case you' il have to move down the bus , please .
straight ahead and turn left by the stairs .
then sharp left again .
i' il be with you in a moment .
sharp ... left .
it was brown .
aren' t you coming up ?
yes .
it' s very clever .
lf we have a row we won' t have to turn our backs on each other .
i see you' ve found the mattresses .
they' re incredibly lovely mattresses .
elevating mattresses .
i was wondering what the benefits of this position are .
it' s incredibly comfortable if you like watching tv or reading in bed .
lots of people do .
yes , i can tell .
it' s actually a pleasant position .
are there any that don' t move like this ?
of course .
but then it' il just be an ordinary mattress .
obviously .
but can' t you get the same quality ?
yes , but as i say , it wouldn' t be an elevating mattress .
ls there a difference between these two ?
ln addition to price , this one is an incredibly good mattress .
you get a lot of mattress for your money .
it' s the ferrari of mattresses .
oh , is it ? ln that case we' il take two .
and two mattress mats .
oh , goodbye !
i think that' il do it .
i think we' ve a couple of bookcases left for our other customers .
down i go ...
you' re mad .
i' il pay for it all .
no , you won' t .
it' s just furniture .
lf you win the lottery you can give me some money .
there may be a couple of day' s delivery time .
that' s all right .
i think we' il just stay here .
oh , no , no , no !
stop it !
hanne !
hanne ?
damn it !
look at this !
hanne !
did you call ?
no .
look !
it keeps turning the pages back .
it' s very clever .
i can' t read backwards , you jerk .
give mikkel a call .
i' il have to wait till tomorrow .
no , i' ve got to have another machine .
it' s the 9th time .
we' il have to ask one of the technicians tomorrow .
yes , let' s tell one of the technicians tomorrow .
would you like some water ?
no .
i don' t want any water .
funny you should mention water .
why ... ?
because i heard a little story about your son michael .
who told you about michael ?
i don' t quite remember ...
who told you about michael ?
someone in a white coat ?
lf you ever mention michael' s name i' il ...
you' il what ?
you' il what ?
just tell me !
come on , hanne , my lass , come on !
you' il what ?
just never mention michael' s name .
get the message ?
never !
oh , i didn' t mean to ...
to what ?
i' m only asking because ...
because what ?
death by drowning , right ?
it' s meant to be ... ... as far as i' ve heard ... one of the very , very worst ...
no , i don' t think so .
do you know what the very , very worst is ?
no ?
it' s being a selfcentred little bastard
lying in a hospital bed , pitiful and helpless while his girlfriend is in love with another man .
that' s the very , very worst thing .
get the message ?
i' m sorry .
it' s not true .
she phones every single day .
hi !
hi , finn .
by the way , i saw that cecilie girl .
oh ?
ok ?
she' s a looker .
are you shafting her ?
finn , her boyfriend is in room 3092 and he' s a quadriplegic .
yes , but are you shafting her ?
that' s right , just ask me directly .
well , somebody is .
it shows .
that' s good .
it' s what she needs .
i just didn' t know you had it in you .
it' s great to see .
ls it ?
well , you are a warm , very likeable person , finn .
just don' t screw up .
it' s not serious , is it ?
will you just shut up ?
what a mess , eh ?
how old are gustav and emil ?
six and eight .
does marie know ?
no .
funnily enough she thinks gustav is in his mid thirties .
