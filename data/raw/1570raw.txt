once upon a time in a kingdom far , far away , the king and queen were blessed with a beautiful baby girl .
and throughout the land , everyone was happy ... until the sun went down and they saw that their daughter was cursed with a frightful enchantment that took hold each and every night .
desperate , they sought the help of a fairy godmother who had them lock the young princess away in a tower , there to await the kiss ... of the handsome prince charming .
it was he who would chance the perilous journey through blistering cold and scorching desert traveling for many days and nights , risking life and limb to reach the dragon' s keep .
for he was the bravest , and most handsome ... in all the land .
and it was destiny that his kiss would break the dreaded curse .
he alone would climb to the highest room of the tallest tower to enter the princess' s chambers , cross the room to her sleeping silhouette , pull back the gossamer curtains to find her ...
what ?
princess ...
fiona ?
no !
oh , thank heavens .
where is she ?
she' s on her honeymoon .

# so she said what' s the problem , baby ?
# what' s the problem ?

let' s go back inside and pretend we' re not home .
harold , we have to be ...

while they' re not looking we can make a run for it .
shrek , stop it !
everything' s gonna be ...
a disaster !
there is no way ...

shrek owns his own land .

oh , yes !
it' s in an enchanted forest abundant in squirrels and cute little duckies and ...
what ?
i know you ain' t talking about the swamp .
an ogre from a swamp .
oh !
how original .
i suppose that would be a fine place to raise the children .
it' s a bit early to be thinking about that , isn' t it ?
indeed .
i just started eating .
harold !
what' s that supposed to mean ?
dad .
it' s great , ok ?
for his type , yes .

bon appetit !
oh , mexican food !

let' s not sit here with our tummies rumbling .
everybody dig in .
don' t mind if i do , lillian .
i suppose any grandchildren i could expect from you would be ...
ogres , yes !
not that there' s anything wrong with that .
right , harold ?
oh , no !
no !
of course , not !
that is , assuming you don' t eat your own young !
dad !
no , we usually prefer the ones who' ve been locked away in a tower !
shrek , please !
i only did that because i love her .
aye , day care or dragon guarded castle .
you wouldn' t understand .
you' re not her father !
it' s so nice to have the family together for dinner .
harold !
shrek !
fiona !

thank you very much , fairy godmother , but i really don' t need all this .
fine .
be that way .
we didn' t like you , anyway .
fiona ?
fiona ?
oh !
you got a puppy ?
all i got in my room was shampoo .
oh , uh ...
fairy godmother , furniture ...
i' d like you to meet my husband , shrek .
your husband ?
what ?
what did you say ?
when did this happen ?
shrek is the one who rescued me .
but that can' t be right .
oh , great , more relatives !
she' s just trying to help .
good !
she can help us pack .
get your coat , dear .
we' re leaving .
what ?
i don' t want to leave .
when did you decide this ?
shortly after arriving .
look , i' m sorry ...
no , that' s all right .
i need to go , anyway .
but remember , dear .
if you should ever need me ... happiness ... is just a teardrop away .
thanks , but we' ve got all the happiness we need .
happy , happy , happy ...
so i see .
let' s go , kyle .
very nice , shrek .
what ?
i told you coming here was a bad idea .
you could' ve at least tried to get along with my father .
i don' t think i was going to get daddy' s blessing , even if i did want it .
do you think it might be nice if somebody asked me what i wanted ?
sure .
do you want me to pack for you ?
you' re unbelievable !
you' re behaving like a ...
go on !
say it !
like an ogre !
here' s a news flash for you !
whether your parents like it or not ...
i am an ogre !
and guess what , princess ?
that' s not about to change .
i' ve made changes for you , shrek .
think about that .
that' s real smooth , shrek .
i' m an ogre !
i knew this would happen .
you should .
you started it .
i can hardly believe that , lillian .
he' s the ogre .
not me .
i think , harold , you' re taking this a little too personally .
this is fiona' s choice .
but she was supposed to choose the prince we picked for her .
i mean , you expect me to give my blessings to this ... thing ?
fiona does .
and she' il never forgive you if you don' t .
i don' t want to lose our daughter again , harold .
oh , you act as if love is totally predictable .
don' t you remember when we were young ?
we used to walk down by the lily pond and ...
they were in bloom ...
our first kiss .
it' s not the same !
i don' t think you realize that our daughter has married a monster !
oh , stop being such a drama king .
fine !
pretend there' s nothing wrong !
la , di , da , di , da !
isn' t it all wonderful !
i' d like to know how it could get any worse !
hello , harold .
what happened ?
nothing , dear !
just the old crusade wound playing up a bit !
i' il just stretch it out here for a while .
you better get in .
we need to talk .
actually , fairy godmother , off to bed .
already taken my pills , and they tend to make me a bit drowsy .
so , how about ... we make this a quick visit .
what ?
oh , hello .
ha ha ha !
so , what' s new ?
you remember my son , prince charming ?
is that you ?
my gosh !
it' s been years .
when did you get back ?
oh , about five minutes ago , actually .
after i endured blistering winds , scorching desert ...
i climbed to the highest room in the tallest tower ...
mommy can handle this .
he endures blistering winds and scorching desert !
he climbs to the highest bloody room of the tallest bloody tower ...
and what does he find ?
some gender confused wolf telling him that his princess is already married .
it wasn' t my fault .
he didn' t get there in time .
stop the car !
harold .
you force me to do something i really don' t want to do .
where are we ?
hi .
welcome to friar' s fat boy !
may i take your order ?
my diet is ruined !
i hope you' re happy .
er ... okay .
two renaissance wraps , no mayo ... chili rings ...
i' il have the medieval meal .
one medieval meal and , harold ...
curly fries ?
no , thank you .
sourdough soft taco , then ?
no , really , i' m fine .
your order , fairy godmother .
this comes with the medieval meal .
there you are , dear .
we made a deal , harold , and i assume you don' t want me to go back on my part .
indeed not .
so , fiona and charming will be together .
yes .
believe me , harold .
it' s what' s best .
not only for your daughter ... but for your kingdom .
what am i supposed to do about it ?
use your imagination .
oh ...
come on in , your majesty .
# i like my town
# with a little drop of poison
# nobody knows ...
excuse me .
do i know you ?
no , you must be mistaking me for someone else .
uh ... excuse me .
i' m looking for the ugly stepsister .
ah !
there you are .
right .
you see , i need to have someone taken care of .
who' s the guy ?
well , he' s not a guy , per se .
um ...
he' s an ogre .
hey , buddy , let me clue you in .
there' s only one fellow who can handle a job like that , and , frankly ... he don' t like to be disturbed .
he don' t like to be disturbed .
where could i find him ?
hello ?
who dares enter my room ?
sorry !
i hope i' m not interrupting , but i' m told you' re the one to talk to about an ogre problem ?
you are told correct .
but for this , i charge a great deal of money .
would ... this be enough ?
you have engaged my valuable services , your majesty .
just tell me where i can find this ogre .
# everyone says i' m getting down too low
# everyone says you' ve just gotta let it go
# you just gotta let it go
# i need some sleep
# time to put the old horse down
# i' m in too deep
# and the wheels keep spinning round
# everyone says you' ve just gotta let it go #
# everyone says you' ve just gotta let it go #
dear knight , i pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude .
dear diary ...
sleeping beauty is having a slumber party tomorrow , but dad says i can' t go .
he never lets me out after sunset .
dad says i' m going away for a while .
must be like some finishing school .
mom says that when i' m old enough , my prince charming will rescue me from my tower and bring me back to my family , and we' il all live happily ever after .
mrs. fiona charming .
mrs. fiona charming .
mrs. fiona charming .
mrs. fiona charming .
sorry .
i hope i' m not interrupting anything .
no , no .
i was just reading a , uh ... a scary book .
i was hoping you' d let me apologize for my despicable behavior earlier .
okay ...
i don' t know what came over me .
do you suppose we could pretend it never happened and start over ...
look , your majesty , i just ...
please .
call me dad .
dad .
we both acted like ogres .
maybe we just need some time to get to know each other .
excellent idea !
i was actually hoping you might join me for a morning hunt .
a little father son time ?
i know it would mean the world to fiona .
shall we say , 7 : 30 by the old oak ?
face it , donkey !
we' re lost .
we can' t be lost .
we followed the king' s instructions exactly .
head to the darkest part of the woods ...
past the sinister trees with scary iooking branches .
the bush shaped like shirley bassey !
we passed that three times already !
you were the one who said not to stop for directions .
oh , great .
my one chance to fix things up with fiona' s dad and i end up lost in the woods with you !
don' t get huffy !
i' m only trying to help .
i know !
i know .
i' m sorry , all right ?
hey , don' t worry about it .
i just really need to make things work with this guy .
yeah , sure .
now let' s go bond with daddy .
well , well , well , donkey .
i know it was kind of a tender moment back there , but the purring ?
what ?
i ain' t purring .
sure .
what' s next ?
a hug ?
hey , shrek .
donkeys don' t purr .
what do you think i am , some kind of a ...
ha ha !
fear me , if you dare !
look !
a little cat .
look out , shrek !
he got a piece !
it' s a cat , donkey .
come here , little kitty , kitty .
come on , little kitty .
come here .
oh !
come here , little kitty .
whoa !
hold on , shrek !
i' m coming !
come on !
get it off !
get it off !
oh , god .
oh ...
no !
look out , shrek !
hold still !
get it off !
shrek !
hold still !
did i miss ?
no .
you got them .
now , ye ogre , pray for mercy from ...
puss ... in boots !
i' il kill that cat !
ah ha ha !
hairball .
oh !
that is nasty !
what should we do with him ?
take the sword and neuter him .
give him the bob barker treatment .
oh , no !
por favor !
please !
i implore you !
it was nothing personal , senor .
i was doing it only for my family .
my mother , she is sick .
and my father lives off the garbage !
the king offered me much in gold and i have a litter of brothers ...
whoa , whoa , whoa !
fiona' s father paid you to do this ?
the rich king ?
si .
well , so much for dad' s royal blessing .
don' t feel bad .
almost everybody that meets you wants to kill you .
gee , thanks .
maybe fiona would' ve been better off if i were some sort of prince charming .
that' s what the king said .
oh , uh ... sorry .
i thought that question was directed at me .
shrek , fiona knows you' d do anything for her .
well , it' s not like i wouldn' t change if i could .
i just ...
i just wish i could make her happy .
hold the phone ...
happiness .
a tear drop away .
donkey !
think of the saddest thing that' s ever happened to you !
aw , man , where do i begin ?
first there was the time that old farmer tried to sell me for some magic beans .
then this fool had a party and he have the guests trying to pin the tail on me .
then they got drunk and start beating me with a stick , going " pinata !!
what is a pinata , anyway ?
no , donkey !
i need you to cry !
don' t go projecting on me .
i know you' re feeling bad , but you got to ...
aaaahhh !
you little , hairy , litter licking sack of ...
what ?
is it on ?
is it on ?
this is fairy godmother .
i' m either away from my desk or with a client .
but if you come by the office , we' il be glad to make you an appointment .
have a " happy ever after .
oh ...
are you up for a little quest , donkey ?
that' s more like it !
shrek and donkey , on another whirlwind adventure !
# ain' t no stoppin ' us now !

stop , ogre !
i have misjudged you .

the position of annoying talking animal has already been taken .
let' s go , shrek .
shrek ?
shrek !
aw , come on , donkey .
look at him ... in his wee little boots .
you know , how many cats can wear boots ?

shrek !
shrek ?
they' re both festive , aren' t they ?
what do you think , harold ?
um ...
yes , yes .
fine .
fine .
try to at least pretend you' re interested in your daughter' s wedding ball .
honestly , lillian , i don' t think it matters .
how do we know there will even be a ball ?
mom .
dad .
oh , hello , dear .
what' s that , cedric ?
right !
coming .
mom , have you seen shrek ?
i haven' t .
you should ask your father .
be sure and use small words , dear .
he' s a little slow this morning .
can i help you , your majesty ?
ah , yes !
um ...
mmm !
exquisite .
what do you call this dish ?
that would be the dog' s breakfast , your majesty .
ah , yes .
very good , then .
carry on , cedric .
dad ?
dad , have you seen shrek ?
no , i haven' t , dear .
i' m sure he just went off to look for a nice ... mud hole to cool down in .
you know , after your little spat last night .
oh .
you heard that , huh ?
the whole kingdom heard you .
i mean , after all , it is in his nature to be ... well , a bit of a brute .
him ?
you know , you didn' t exactly roll out the welcome wagon .
well , what did you expect ?
look at what he' s done to you .
shrek loves me for who i am .
i would think you' d be happy for me .
darling , i' m just thinking about what' s best for you .
maybe you should do the same .
no , really ?
shh ...
oh ...
oh , no .
that' s the old keebler' s place .
let' s back away slowly .
that' s the fairy godmother' s cottage .
she' s the largest producer of hexes and potions in the whole kingdom .
then why don' t we pop in there for a spell ?
ha ha !
spell !
he makes me laugh .
hi .
i' m here to see the ...
the fairy godmother .
i' m sorry .
she is not in .
jerome !
coffee and a monte cristo .
now !
yes , fairy godmother .
right away .
look , she' s not seeing any clients today , ok ?
that' s ok , buddy .
we' re from the union .
the union ?
we represent the workers in all magical industries , both evil and benign .
oh !
oh , right .
are you feeling at all degraded or oppressed ?
uh ... a little .
we don' t even have dental .
they don' t even have dental .
okay , we' il just have a look around .
oh .
by the way .
i think it' d be better if the fairy godmother didn' t know we were here .
know what i' m saying ?
huh ?
huh ?
huh ?
huh ?
stop it .
of course .
go right in .
a drop of desire .
naughty !
a pinch of passion .
and just a hint of ...
lust !
excuse me .
sorry to barge in like this ...
what in grimm' s name are you doing here ?
well , it seems that fiona' s not exactly happy .
oh ho ho !

you both will be fine ?
i guess it means it' il affect fiona , too .
hey , man , this don' t feel right .
my donkey senses are tingling all over .
drop that jug o ' voodoo and let' s get out of here .
it says , " beauty divine .
how bad can it be ?
see , you' re allergic to that stuff .
you' il have a reaction .
and if you think that i' il be smearing vapor rub over your chest , think again !
boss , just in case there is something wrong with the potion ... allow me to take the first sip .
it would be an honor to lay my life on the line for you .
oh , no , no .
i don' t think so .
if there' il be any animal testing , i' il do it .
that' s the best friend' s job .
now give me that bottle .
how do you feel ?
i don' t feel any different .
i look any different ?
you still look like an ass to me .
maybe it doesn' t work on donkeys .
well , here' s to us , fiona .

i know !
but i love fiona more .

are you going so soon ?
don' t you want to see your wife ?
fiona ?
shrek ?
aye , fiona .
it is me .
what happened to your voice ?
the potion changed a lot of things , fiona .
but not the way i feel about you .
fiona ?
charming ?
do you think so ?
dad .
i was so hoping you' d approve .
um ...
who are you ?
mom , it' s me , shrek .
i know you never get a second chance at a first impression , but , well , what do you think ?
fiona !
fiona !
fiona !
fiona !
fiona , fiona !
ho ho ho !
oh , shoot !
i don' t think they can hear us , pigeon .
don' t you think you' ve already messed her life up enough ?
i just wanted her to be happy .
and now she can be .
oh , sweetheart .
she' s finally found the prince of her dreams .
but look at me .
look what i' ve done for her .
it' s time you stop living in a fairy tale , shrek .
she' s a princess , and you' re an ogre .
that' s something no amount of potion will ever change .
but ...
i love her .
if you really love her ... you' il let her go .
shrek ?
senor .
what' s going on ?
where are you going ?
you wouldn' t have had anything to do with this , would you , harold ?
# people just ain' t no good
# i think that' s well understood
there you go , boys .
just leave the bottle , doris .
hey .
why the long face ?
it was all just a stupid mistake .
i never should have rescued her from that tower in the first place .
i hate mondays .
i can' t believe you' d walk away from the best thing that happened to you .
what choice do i have ?
she loves that pretty boy , prince charming .
come on .
is he really that good iooking ?
are you kidding ?
he' s gorgeous !
he has a face that looks like it was carved by angels .
oh .
he sounds dreamy .
you know ... shockingly , this isn' t making me feel any better .
look , guys .
it' s for the best .
mom and dad approve , and fiona gets the man she' s always dreamed of .
everybody wins .
except for you .
i don' t get it , shrek .
you love fiona .
aye .
and that' s why i have to let her go .
excuse me , is she here ?
she' s , uh ... in the back .
oh , hello again .
fairy godmother .
charming .
you' d better have a good reason for dragging us down here , harold .
well , i' m afraid fiona isn' t really ... warming up to prince charming .
fyl , not my fault .
no , of course it' s not , dear .
i mean , how charming can i be when i have to pretend i' m that dreadful ogre ?
no , no , it' s nobody' s fault .
perhaps it' s best if we just call the whole thing off , okay ?
what ?
you can' t force someone to fall in love !
i beg to differ .
i do it all the time !
have fiona drink this and she' il fall in love with the first man she kisses , which will be charming .
umm ... no .
what did you say ?
i can' t .
i won' t do it .
oh , yes , you will .
if you remember , i helped you with your happily ever after .
and i can take it away just as easily .
is that what you want ?
is it ?
no .
good boy .
now , we have to go .
i need to do charming' s hair before the ball .
he' s hopeless .
he' s all high in the front .
he can never get to the back .
you need someone to do the back .
oh .
thank you , mother .
mother ?
um ...
mary !
a talking horse !
the ogre !
stop them !
thieves !
bandits !
stop them !
the abs are fab and it' s gluteus to the maximus here at tonight' s far , far away royal ball blowout !
the coaches are lined up as the cream of the crop pours out of them
like miss muffet' s curds and whey .
everyone who' s anyone has turned out to honor princess fiona and prince shrek .
and , oh my , the outfits look gorgeous !
look !
hansel and gretel !

who is this ?
oh .
it' s the one , it' s the only ...
it' s the fairy godmother !
hello , far , far away !
can i get a whoop whoop ?
may all your endings be happy and ...
well , you know the rest !
we' il be right back with the royal far , far away ball after these messages .
i hate these ball shows .
they bore me to tears .

hey , mice , pass me a buffalo wing !
no , to your left .

how about a nice hot cup of tea before the ball ?
i' m not going .
the whole kingdom' s turned out to celebrate your marriage .
there' s just one problem .
that' s not my husband .
i mean , look at him .
yes , he is a bit different , but people change for the ones they love .
you' d be surprised how much i changed for your mother .
change ?
he' s completely lost his mind !
why not come down to the ball and give him another chance ?
you might find you like this new shrek .
but it' s the old one i fell in love with , dad .
i' d give anything to have him back .
darling .
that' s mine .
decaf .
otherwise i' m up all night .
