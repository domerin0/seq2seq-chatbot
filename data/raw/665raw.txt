ladies and gentlemen , boys and girls and children of all ages .
what will they think of next ?
see here .
a bitty bot , a tinkertoy , a living doll .
of course , we all know why they made him .
to steal your hearts , to replace your children .
this is the latest iteration in a series of insults to human dignity ... and in their grand scheme to phase out all of god' s little children .
meet the next generation of child designed ... to do just that .
do not be fooled ... by the artistry of this creation .
no doubt there was talent in the crafting of this simulator .
yet with the very first strike ... you will see the big lie come apart before your very eyes !
don' t burn me !
don' t burn me !
i' m not pinocchio !
don' t make me die !
i' m david !
i' m david !
i' m david !
mecha don' t plead for their lives .
who is that ?
he looks like a boy .
built like a boy to disarm us .
see how they try to imitate our emotions now ?
i' m david !
we are only demolishing artificiality !
let he who is without sim ... cast the first stone .
oh , ho ho !
he' s just a boy .
johnson , you' re a monster !
let that boy go !
let him go !
get him out of there before they tear this place apart .
we found him .
where ?
a flesh fair outside haddonfield .
is he alive ?
yes .
he' s in one piece .
i see the moon .
is it real ?
i don' t know , david .
i sit coming ?
i can' t tell yet .
let' s not walk this way .
where are we going ?
this way now .
are you in bad trouble ?
have you run away from someone ?
my mommy told me to run away .
why did she say that ?
i guess ... because henry didn' t like me .
why was that ?
martin came home .
and who is he ?
martin is mommy and henry' s real son .
after i find the blue fairy , then i can go home .
mommy will love a real boy .
the blue fairy will make me into one .
is blue fairy mecha , orga , man or woman ?
woman . ``woman " ?
i know women !
# [ begins ]
they sometimes ask for me by name . # i' m in heaven # i know all about women .
as about as much as there is to know .
no two are ever alike .
and after they' ve met me , no two ... are ever the same .
and i know where most of them can be found .
where ?
rouge city .
across the delaware .
too far for our feet .
we' il need help to get there .
# [ stops ]
and ... it is not without peril .
we will have to journey ...
towards the moon .
are there many women in rouge city ?
as there are stars at night .
how will we find just one ?
we will ask dr. know .
there is nothing he doesn' t .
exactly what name do you give this woman ?
she is ... just blue fairy .
blue fairy .
in the world of orga , blue is the color of melancholy .
yet , the services i provide will put a blush back on anyone' s cheek .
i will change the color of your fairy for you .
she will scream out in the moonlight , ``oh !
oh , yes !
oh , god !
oh , yes !
oh , god !
oh , god !
she will make you a real boy , for i will make her a real woman .
and all will be right with the world because you held my hand ... and saved my brain , so that once again my customers may ask for me by name ``gigolo joe , what do ya know ?
why do you do that ?
that' s just what i do .
now , follow me and don' t fall behind .
all roads lead to rouge .
don' t they say that , eh ?
don' t they just ?
there are girls your age who are just like me .
we are the guiltless pleasures of the lonely human being .
you' re not gonna get us pregnant or have us to supper with mommy and daddy .
we work under you , we work on you and we work for you .
man made us better at what we do than was ever humanly possible .
if you could manage us a lift to rouge city ,
all this ... [ giggling ]
and much , much more ... can be yours .
get in .
say ``ah .
ah .

that' s our lady of the immaculate heart .
the ones who made us are always looking for the ones who made them .
they go in , fold their hands , look around their feet , sing songs ... and when they come out it' s usually me they find .
i' ve picked up a lot of business on this spot .
# are the stars out tonight #
but, joe , where' s blue fairy ? # [ stops ]
that' s what we' re gonna find out when we ask dr. know .
that' s where everyone goes who needs to know .
meet the good doctor .
starving minds , welcome to dr. know , where fast food for thought is served up 24 hours a day ... in 40, 000 locations nationwide .
ask dr. know .
there' s nothing i don' t .
tell me where i can find the blue fairy .
question me , you pay the fee .
two for five , you get one free .
he means two questions cost five new bucks with a third question on the house .
in this day and age , david , nothing costs more than information .
that' s everything .
ten new bucks and a ten copper comes to ... seven questions for dr. know .
that should be enough .
he' s a smooth operator .
he' il press our limits .
but try we must .
greetings , colleagues .
on offer , factual text or fictionalized text .
first or third person , literacy range from primal level to postdoctoral .
usual span of styles from fairy tale to religious .
who' s who or where' s where ... or flat fact .
flat fact ?
thank you for question number one .
flat fact is a term demanding an equal answer
that shouldn' t count .
that wasn' t my question .
you must take care not to raise your voice up at the end of the sentence .
flat fact .
you have six more questions .
where is blue fairy ?
in the garden .
vascostylis blue fairy .
blooms twice annually with bright blue flowers on a branched inflorescence .
a hybrid between ``ascola " meda arnold .
you have five more questions .
who is blue fairy ?
are you sad , lonely , looking for a friend ?

what is blue fairy ?
pinocchio , by carlo collodi . ``at this signal , there was a rustling as of flapping of wings ... ``and a large falcon flew to the windows ill . ``what are your orders , beautiful fairy ? '
that' s her . ``for you must know that the child with blue hair ... ``was no other than the good hearted fairy ... who had lived in that wood for more than a thousand
david !
david .
that' s her !
it was an example of her .
but i think we' re getting closer .
but if a fairy tale is real , then wouldn' t it be fact a flat fact ?
say no more .
new category , please .
combine ... fact with ...
fairy tale .
now ... ask him again .
how can the blue fairy ... make ... a robot ... into a real live boy ?
come away , o human child , to the water sand the wild ... with a fairy hand in hand , for the world' s more full of weeping than you can understand .
your quest will be perilous , yet there ward is beyond price .
in his book , how can a robot become human ?
professor allen hobby writes of the power ... which will transform mecha into orga .
will you tell me how to find her ?
discovery is quite possible .
our blue fairy does exist in one place , and in one place only .
at the end of the world where the lions weep .
here is the place dreams are born .
many a mecha has gone to the end of the world ... never to come back .
that is why they call the end of the world ``man hattan .
and that' s why we must go there .
wait !
what if the blue fairy isn' t real at all , david ?
what if she' s magic ?
the supernatural is the hidden web that unites the universe .
orga believe what cannot be seen or measured .
it' s that oddness that separates our species .
or what if the blue fairy is an electronic parasite ... that has a reason to haunt the minds of artificial intelligence ?
they hate us , you know the humans .
they' il stop at nothing .
my mommy doesn' t hate me ... because i' m special and unique .
because there has never been anyone like me before , ever .
mommy loves martin because he is real , and when i am real ...
mommy' s going to read to me and tuck me in my bed and sing to me ... and listen to what i say and she will cuddle with me ... and tell me every day , a hundred times a day , that she loves me !
she loves what you do for her , as my customers love what it is i do for them .
but she does not love you , david .
she cannot love you .
you are neither flesh nor blood .
you are not a dog or a cat or a canary .
you were designed and built specific like the rest of us .
and you are alone now only because they tired of you ... or replaced you with a younger model ... or were displeased with something you said or broke .
they made us too smart , too quick and too many .
we are suffering for the mistakes they made because when the end comes , all that will be left is us .
that' s why they hate us .
and that' s why you must stay here ... with me .
good bye, joe .
stay back .
stay back .
let' s clear this doorway , please .
you' re in bad trouble .
go about your business now .
be careful , david .
this is not a toy .
destination ?
manhattan .
mecha restricted area .
manhattan .
destination achieved .
the lost city in the sea at the end of the world .
where the lions weep .
turn around, joe .
we' re not gonna give up yet , david .
turn around, joe .
turn all the way around .

hello ?
hello ?
is this the place they make you real ?
this is the place they make you read .
are you real ?
i guess .
are you me ?
i' m david .
you' re not .
yes , i am .
i' m david .
so am i.
hello , david .
can you read ?
can you sit down and we can read together ?
let' s be friends .
you can' t have her .
i can' t hear you .
she' s mine .
and i' m the only one .
i' m david !
i' m david !
i' m david !
i' m david !
i' m david !
i' m david !
i' m david !
i' m david !
i' m special !
i' m unique !
i' m david !
you can' t have her !
i' m david .
i' m david .
i' m david .
i' m david .
david ?
i' m david .
yes , you are david .
professor hobby ?
yes , david , i' ve been waiting for you .
dr. know told me you' d be here .
is blue fairy here too ?
i first heard of your blue fairy from monica .
what did you believe the blue fairy could do for you ?
she would make me a real boy .
but you are a real boy .
at least as real as i' ve ever made one , which by all reasonable accounts ... would make me your blue fairy .
you are not her .
dr. know told me that she would be here ... at the lost city in the sea at the end of the world
that' s what dr. know needed to know to get you to come home to us .
and it' s the only time we intervened the only help that we gave him ... to give toyou ...
so you could find your way home to us .
until you were born , robots didn' t dream , robots didn' t desire unless we told them what to want .
david , do you have any idea what a success story you' ve become ?
you found a fairy tale ... and inspired by love , fueled by desire , you set out on a journey to make her real .
and most remarkable of all , no one taught you how .
we actually lost you for a while .
but when you were found again , we didn' t make our presence known because our test was a simple one .
where would your self motivated reasoning take you ?
to the logical conclusion ... that blue fairy is part of the great human flaw to wish for things that don' t exist , or to the greatest single human gift the ability to chase down our dreams .
and that is something no machine has ever done until you .
i thought i was one of a kind .
my son was one of a kind .
you are the first of a kind .
david .
my brain is falling out .
would you like to come meet your real mothers and fathers ?
the team is anxious to talk to you .
i want you to wait here .
i' il gather them up .
we want to hear everything about your adventures .
we want to thank you ... and tell you what' s in store for you next .
mommy .
i saw it, joe .
i saw it the place where she lives .
she' s right down there, joe .
she is ?
she' s waiting for me !
we have to go !
uh oh .
when you become a real boy , remember me to the ladies when you grow up .
good bye, joe .
good bye , david .
i am .
i was !
david , please , be careful .
the blue fairy' s all right .
what happened ?
i don' t know .
we are in a cage .
blue fairy ?
please .
please , please make me into a real , live boy .
please .
blue fairy ?
please .
please .
make me real .
blue fairy , please .
please make me real .
please make me a real boy .
please , blue fairy .
make me into a real boy .
please .
and david continued to pray ... to the blue fairy there before him she who smiled softly forever , she who welcomed forever .
eventually , the flood lights dimmed and died , but david could still see her palely by day ... and he still addressed her in hope .
he prayed until all the sea anemones had shriveled and died .
he prayed as the ocean froze ... and the ice encased the caged amphibicopter and the blue fairy too ,
locking them together where he could still make her out .
a blue ghost in ice ... always there , always smiling , always awaiting him .
eventually , he never moved at all , but this eyes always stayed open ... staring a head forever all through the darkness of each night ... and the next day ... and the next day .
thus , 2, 000 years passed by .
teddy , we' re home .
mommy !
mommy !
we' re home !
where are you ?
david .
david .
david .
david .
you have been searching for me , haven' t you , david ?
for my whole life .
and what , after all this time , have you come to ask me ?
i have a wish to make .
and what is your wish ?
please make me a real boy ... so my mommy will love me and let me stay with her .
david , i will do anything that is possible , but i cannot make you a real boy .
where am i ?
this looks like my house , but it is different .
yes , it is different , but it' s also your home .
we read your mind , and it' s all here .
there' s nothing too small that you didn' t store for us to remember .
we so want you to be happy .
you are so important to us , david .
you are unique in all the world .
will mommy be coming home soon ?
is she out shopping with martin now ?
david , she can never come home ... because 2, 000 years have passed , and she is no longer living .
dearest david , when you are lonely , we can bring back other people from your time in the past .
if you can bring back other people , why can' t you bring back her ?
because we can only bring back people ... whose bodies we dig up from the ice .
we need some physical sample of the person ,
like a bone or a finger nail .
david ?
yes , teddy ?
do you remember when you cut some of mommy' s hair ?
henry shook me .
and you dropped her hair ?
i know .
now you can bring her back , can' t you ?
give him what he wants .
dearest david , your wish is my command .
hey, joe , what do ya know ?
david , i often felt a sort of envy of human beings ... of that thing they called ``spirit .
human beings had created a million explanations of the meaning of life ... in art , in poetry , in mathematical formulas .
certainly , human beings must be the key to the meaning of existence .
but human beings no longer existed .
so we began a project ... that would make it possible to recreate the living body of a person long dead ... from the d. n. a. in a fragment of bone or mummified skin .
we also wondered , would it be possible ... to retrieve a memory trace in resonance with a recreated body ?
and you know what we found ?
we found the very fabric of space time itself ... appeared to store information ... about every event which had ever occurred in the past .
but the experiment was a failure , for those who were resurrected only lived through a single day of renewed life .
when the resurrectees fell asleep on the night of their first new day , they died again .
as soon as they became unconscious , their very existence faded away into darkness .
so you see , david , the equations had shown that once an individual space time pathway had been used , it could not be reused .
if we bring mother back now , it will only be for one day , and then you will never be able to see her again .
maybe
maybe she will be special .
maybe she will stay .
i thought this would be hard for you to understand .
you were created to be so young .
maybe the one day will be like that one day inside the amphibicopter .
maybe it will last forever .
david , you are the enduring memory of the human race .
the most lasting proof of their genius .
we only want for your happiness .
david , you' ve had so little of that .
if you want for my happiness , then you know what you have to do .
listen .
can you hear that ?
the new morning has come .
go to her , david .
she' s just waking up this instant .
i found you .
hi .
hi .
i must have dozed off .
how long have i  would you like some coffee ?
just the way you like it ?
yeah , i' d love a coffee .
it' il wake me up .
okay .
you never forget how , do you ?
no .
i never forget .
i must be a little confused .
what day is it ?
it is ... today .
and as the day wore on ,
david thought it was the happiest day of his life .
all the problems seemed to have disappeared ... from his mommy' s mind .
there was no henry , there was no martin , there was no grief .
there was only david .
david had been warned not to explain anything to monica .
otherwise , she would become frightened , and everything would be spoiled .
but david' s journey home belonged only to him , so he didn' t see the harm of painting her pictures of things ... she would have no memory of .
david had never had a birthday party because david had never been born , so they baked a cake and lit some candles .
now , make a wish .
it came true already .
by now , indeed , the windows were beginning to dim .
david drew the shades ... without even needing to be asked .
i really ought to be tucking you in .
how strange .
how fascinating .
i can hardly keep my eyes open .
i don' t know what' s come over me .
such a beautiful day .
i love you , david .
i do love you .
i have always loved you .
that was the ever lasting moment he had been waiting for .
and the moment had passed , for monica was sound a sleep .
more than merely a sleep .
should he shake her , she would never rouse .
so david went to sleep too .
and for the first time in his life , he went to that place ... where dreams are born .
