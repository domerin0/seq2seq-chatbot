carl jung tells us ... that the human psyche contains ... a figment of ourselves ... that even the collective unconscious denies .
good morning , paul .
it' s nice to see you in class .
am i keeping you up ?
what do i mean by all this , people ?
i mean that inside all of us ... there lurks a dark , malevolent figure .
a kind of boogeyman , if you will ... that jung called what ?
stick with me , people .
take that kierkegaardian leap of faith .
jung said we must face down our fears ... and face up to the figure he called ... what ?
the shadow .
the shadow .
yes , sara , very good .
thank you .
i' m glad somebody was awake .
wow , what a class .
hey , sara !
sara , wait up !
i' ve been looking for you everywhere .
guess what ?
uh uh .
what did you sign us up for this time ?
eee , ha ha !
we gotta find rudy .
come on .
hey , rudy .
don' t distract me .
i can' t help myself .
i am distracting .
have you checked your email ?
no .
why ?
did you send me something ?
we' re in !
they picked all three of us !
what ?
are you serious ?
uh huh !
oh , god !
yes !
all right .
that is all good .
this isn' t one of your little jokes , is it ?
no , but sara doesn' t want to go .
i might go .
i just haven' t decided yet .
no , no , no .
that is unacceptable .
it is unacceptable .
we' re gonna be bigger than " the osbournes .
we' re gonna be large .
every time i let you two talk me into something ...
i live to regret it .
listen , without me , you would die of boredom .
us !
without us , you would die of boredom .
whatever .
are you sure they' re not just putting us in some house ... with hidden cameras in the shower ?
no .
it' s like we' re investigative reporters ... searching a crime scene .
and look at the scholarship .
yeah .
besides that , thousands of people ... are going to see my face ... our face .
don' t do it .
that' s the house where it all started .
he walked its hallways , hid in its closets ... dreamed in its bedrooms ... helped his mother in the kitchen ... watched tv in the living room with his dad ... played in his sister' s bedroom .
then one day , he picked up a knife ... and he never put it down again .
that guy' s fucking weird .
don' t pay attention to him .
he' s trying to scare us .
i just need to send a quick email .
deckard ...
you' il never believe what i got myself into .
deckard ?
who' s deckard ?
oh , it' s my screen name .
sara needed some tech support setting up her offline reader ... so i , uh ...
you told her you' re a graduate student ?
graduate of what , junior high ?
shut up , all right ?
we talk every day .
it' s kind of like we' re dating .
she' s never even seen you ... and yahoo chat rooms do not count .
yes , they do count .
did you know in the old days ... knights used to spend their entire lives ... courting ladies that they would never even touch ?
they would just send each other sonnets and stuff .
that' s before internet porn , man .
whatever .
now what are you doing ?
just give me a second , all right ?
i hope sara shows up .
and wearing something acceptable .
she can' t still be mad at us for the last time .
here she is .
hey !
ok , everybody listen up !
sara , are you gonna wear this ?
i thought i told you we were gonna be on camera .
i' d like to start this off by saying the search is over .
you six have been selected ... to explore america' s worst nightmare tomorrow night , halloween ...
live , in front of the whole entire internet universe .
you six will enter the birthplace of evil ... in its purest form the childhood home of our most brutal mass murderer ...
michael myers .
thank you .
thank you .
so , what do you hope to find in the house tomorrow night ?
my way into network broadcasting .
pfft !
i just want to say that michael myers ... is not just a man behind a mask ... he' s a legend .
i' m interested in how michael myers ... embodies the politics of violence ... embedded in pop mythology .
never underestimate the effect of a poor diet .
too much protein , not enough zinc , next thing you know ... you' re cutting up bodies in your bathtub .
look at hitler .
he was a vegetarian .
the brother was seriously malnourished .
you don' t have to go far to find michael myers .
he is the great white shark of our unconscious .
he is the dark eyed child of our spirits .
he' s every murderous impulse we' ve ever had .
he' s the little voice that whispers to us ... to strangle the old lady ... taking too long at the checkout counter .
get to know him , baby .
he' s you .
tell us , sara , why do ordinary people turn to murder ?
well , i , um ...
i think it has something to do with upbringing .
aah !
damn !
that girl can sing .
that' s what i' m looking for .
ooh .
ha !
hunh !
hyah !
get his ass !
get his ass !
get his ass !
who' s better than wat chun lee ?
whoopin ' everybody ass while he' s smokin ' a cigarette .
oh , shit .
who' s knockin ' on my door this late ?
whoever this is is distracting me ... from seeing wat chun lee whoop some ass .
sara ?
ooh .
sara , what are you doing here ?
it' s late .
i' m dropping out .
what ?
i' m sorry .
it' s just i' m so freaked out i can' t even sleep .
slow down , slow down .
what' s the problem ?
can' t you see i' m not like the others ?
i know you' re not like the others .
you know you' re not like the others .
the others ain' t nothin ' but a bunch ... of smart ass , wise crackin ' , posin ' wannabes .
you are the real deal .
every existing element about you ... is what the internet audience really wants .
i don' t want to be famous .
what do you mean you don' t want to be famous ?
that' s the american dream .
i think i' m just scared .
it' s ok to be scared .
being scared is good .
fear is good .
fear motivates .
fear gives you the feeling of being alive .
fear makes me want to throw up .
trust me , please .
when it' s all said and done , at the end of the day ... you' d be surprised of how much you surprise yourself .
i' m sorry to bother you .
i just
it' s ok .
do me a favor .
sleep on it .
we' il talk about it tomorrow .
you can sweat it tonight , man .
now take your tail on outta here and go to bed .
ol ' freddie boy , damn , you good .
shit you come up with off the top of your head , boy .
why don' t you just pat yourself on your back ?
oh , wat chun lee !
oh !
now , are you coming out soon ... or are you planning on subletting ?
mmm !
sexy girl !
ha ha !
don' t you think it' s a bit too revealing ?
i think it' s perfectly revealing .
aah !
what ?
are you ok ?
did you see the boogeyman or something ?
the boogeyman ?
how very jungian .
dr. mixter' s class ?
i' m taking that course , too .
i hope they have this in black .
thrift stores .
oh , how marvelous , darling .
ahh , there she is .
oh , my god , you' ve been pussy whipped .
what' s worse , you' ve been cyber whipped .
by the way , where' s your costume ?
i can' t go out tonight .
i promised sara i would watch her first episode .
she' s really nervous about it .
no , mickey stern' s party is tonight , and you know that .
oh , yeah .
i' m sorry , man .
i guess i forgot .
forgot ?
do you have any idea ... what it means for two freshmen to get invited ?
it' s never happened before !
your sister invited us ... so you wouldn' t tell your mother about her tattoo .
that' s besides the point , myles barton .
you can sit here in your little dream fantasy world ... or you can come with me to this party ... and learn to walk like a man .
what' s it gonna be ?
all right , let' s go .
ahh , chat room romance ?
he' s just a friend .
he' s probably fifty and bald , with a bad toupee .
jen .
probably collects human skin .
give me a break , jen .
ok , everybody listen up .
i' d like to start off by saying ... the home that you will be entering tonight ... has been rigged up with several cameras ... but for the most part ... the audience will see only what you see .
see these cameras right here ?
i kinda like these cameras .
they can pretty much be clipped on to anything .
a hat , shirt collar , your coat collar .
the viewers can pretty much control ... what they want to watch ... switch around from camera to camera ... depending on what seems to be the most intriguing to them .
so if you guys want to be stars for the night ...
i suggest you do something that is very interesting ... so that it' s worth the while of the viewers ... to want to keep their cameras on you .
cameras are so phallic .
is that good or bad ?
depends who' s watching .
hey , orson welles , pick a placement and move on .
look , low angles scary .
high angles scary .
medium angles boring .
i bet you learned that shooting ... all those weddings and bar mitzvahs .
hey , hey !
i went to long beach state .
same as spielberg .
charley , we' re on a schedule here .
tell max to rig a camera in the sister' s room .
max is back at the hotel helping freddie .
ok .
freddie !
baby , calm down .
it' s all good .
just relax .
i got it all under control .
there was this firebird parked in front of the house .
totally about to ruin the establishing shot ... but i called a tow truck .
yep , it' s on its way .
all righty .
bye .
look at you , charley .
that' s a nice angle , boy .
look , there he is now .
all right , here we go .
mr. harris !
can we ask you a few questions , mr. harris ?
right over here .
i got one word for you .
what' s that ?
product placement .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .
product placement , i like the sound of that .
while we' re going around the house ... discovering the secrets of michael myers ... we could be drinking pepsi or sporting the gap , right ?
nice sexy thinking .
i kind of like that .
how' s everyone doing this evening ?
we' il get it started like this , see ?
in the next ten minutes ... we are going to enter a mystery ... wrapped up inside of a riddle inside of an enigma .
now , remember this .
everything you see ... absolutely everything you see is real .
there' s no actors ... none of the components or contents in the house ... have been messed with , mixed up , diluted ... or tampered with in any shape , form , or fashion whatsoever .
now , i' m not exactly sure what' s gonna happen ... but what i do know is that no one will be allowed ... to leave until the show is over .
our state of the art camera surveillance system ... will pick up anyone who tries to sneak out .
let the dangertainment begin out this motherfucker .
well , people , let' s do it .
rudy !
way to go .
this is gonna be fun .
i read that after the murders ... the family just sealed it up ... and left without taking anything with them .
it' s not exactly a house you put on the market .
yeah , but i' il bet it has ... one of those big nice old kitchens , you know ?
where are you going ?
i' m gonna check it out .
what are we gonna do ?
we don' t have to do anything .
technically , we just have to be in the house .
aren' t we supposed to be looking for answers ?
the devil made him do it .
i' m done .
we owe it to the people watching ... to at least take a look around .
oh , that' s cute .
you' re already worried about your fan base ?
you are this close to getting voted off the island .
hey , check this out .
you want something tasty and delicious ?
you ever tasted forty year old fennel ?
eww , don' t .
it' s got to be rotten .
that' s strange .
what ?
it smells fresh .
yeah , it does .
you know , donna , you got great legs .
what time do they open ?
that' d be 1 : 00 ?
god damn .
sara .
you think this is the one that he used to do his thing ?
no .
they' d keep that in an evidence locker somewhere .
whew .
boo .
aah !
what , are you scared ?
no .
what' s in here ?
what is that ?
ok , so i admit ... that this place is a little creepy , ok ?
no , no , no .
you have no idea .
look at this .
wow , a chair .
my god .
do you think they actually kept him in this ?
what is that ?
looks like the medieval key to sara' s chastity belt .
rudy !
ok , yeah .
maybe we should poke around a bit ... see what else we can find .
ha !
aye aye , captain .
why are you touching me ?
don' t .
go poke .
hey , what' s going on ?
sexy .
look at you !
scott , what are we doing here ?
hey , come on , man , be cool , all right ?
relax .
have fun .
shit .
hey , myles , do you think anyone will know ... we' re supposed to be from " pulp fiction " ?
huhh !
huhh !
today , you' re scared of the boogeyman .
ha ha ha !
he' s gonna get you .
he' s coming behind you .
boogeyman !
ohh !
shit !
careful , jen .
ahem .
hands off , bud .
bet this is judith' s room .
you know , the older sister .
the one he killed when he was six years old .
hey !
keep the camera on the money here .
i think it happened when she was right there .
poor little judith ... helpless ... brushing her hair ... young ... and naked .
yeah , because that' s gonna happen , right ?
come on , jen .
one flash , and you could light up ... a thousand computer screens .
launch your whole career .
you think ?
you crack me up .
it' s a good wardrobe for you , jen .
wait !
no !
there was somebody else in the hall !
come on .
come on , lover boy .
whoa !
aah !
what are you doing , you big perv ?
they' re exploring the house of a mass murderer live .
you want to watch ?
no way .
sure .
oh , ok .
impulse control disorder .
huh ?
that' s my theory .
i think michael myers had fits of rage ... that he could not control .
kind of like a klepto or a nympho or a pyro .
so , instead of stealing silverware ... he slashes the necks of teenage girls , huh ?
oh , come on ... haven' t you ever had an impulse that you could not control ?
continuously .
you mean continually .
continuous " means continuing uninterrupted ... while " continual " means reoccurring periodically .
donna , when are you gonna get out of your head ... and start thinking with your body ?
please .
does that line ever actually work ... on the chicks in the music department ?
art history , too .
sometimes even poli sci .
well , it doesn' t cut it with critical studies .
bummer .
besides , screwing a music major ... would be tantamount to lesbianism .
i could get into that .
sara , i' m telling you , it' s in the food .
remember that guy who was on trial ... for murder in san francisco ?
all he ate was twinkies .
rudy , do you ever think about anything other than food ?
wouldn' t you like to know ?
jen ?
jen ?
what' s going on ?
what happened ?
i don' t know .
i turned my back for a second and she was gone .
jen !
jen ?
jen ?
jen .
jen ?
jen ?
jen ?
turn it down !
gotcha !
god , you bitch .
slut !
that' s not right , ok ?
you' re foul .
uhh , so foul .
this is to us , for successfully
let me give you a little more puttin ' together something collectively ... so ingenious as a team and a duo ... that we should definitely be able to secure ... a lot of food on the table for ourselves ... as long as everything goes as nicely ... as it' s goin ' right now .
i' m gonna get her back for that .
watch me .
oh , my god !
cheers .
oh , no !
no !
mm .
mm .
wait , what just happened ?
we just lost bill' s camera .
oh , shit .
he must' ve dropped it .
fucking idiot .
find another view quickly , please .
freddie , relax .
i think this is going really well .
really , baby ?
yes .
we are doing our thing .
ok .
to dangertainment .
salute .
heh heh heh .
and this must be the bed where he was conceived .
stop showing off , jen .
aaaah !
aaaah !
rudy !
sara !
jen , help me !
are you ok ?
rudy , help .
sara !
ewww .
god .
what happened ?
what is that thing ?
hey , is this that michael myers thing ?
yeah .
a' ight , cool .
yeah , ok .
what is this ?
oh .
sorry .
are you ?
you' re such a lothario .
um ...
i don' t know what that means exactly , but ...
just go with it .
hold on .
i just thought of something .
hold on ?
you' ve got to be kidding me .
what , are you looking for " playboys " ?
this ain' t right .
well , it' s obvious that the boy was subject ... to emotional and physical abuse .
no , all of this .
it' s not right .
it' s too easy .
why is all this stuff still here ?
answer that , nancy drew .
where' s bill ?
he' s probably still mad at me .
he' s gonna jump out of somewhere and scare me .
you watch .
you watch .
jim ?
uh .
you know , if i' m keeping you from something ... just let me know .
look .
voil .
clever boy .
see , they' re looking for clues .
something that might explain why michael myers went bad .
oh .
jeez .
hey , scott .
what' s up ?
god , nice costume .
whoa .
hey , you think they kept him down here ?
maybe .
look at this .
what ?
what is it ?
it' s some sort of weird harness .
this whole place looks like some sadistic playpen .
ah ha ha .
and you know what that makes me think ?
what ?
there' s definitely no cameras down here .
i could be a camera .
say something smart .
existence precedes essence .
god , you are sexy .
whoa !
oh , shit !
that worked perfectly !
whoa !
that is what i' m talking about .
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
all his victims !
it' s a mass grave !
oh , my god !
oh , god .
all of his victims .
oh !
shit .
look at this .
i don' t fucking believe this .
what ?
made in fucking taiwan .
oh , shit , man !
charley , where the fuck you been ?
we' ve been lookin ' all over this motherfucker for you !
and why the hell are you dressed like me anyway ?
i ain' t payin ' you to be michael myers .
i' m playin ' michael myers !
if them kids come around ... and see us dressed up in the same shit ... you' il ruin the whole effect , god damn it .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
what you lookin ' at me like that for ?
huh ?
you don' t get it ?
your shit ain' t workin ' up there ?
take your ass in the back of the garage with nora .
that' s your job .
go back there with nora and help her ass out .
go do your job .
i left the back door unlocked for your ass ... to go out the back into the garage .
that' s what i did .
you need to get the hell outta here .
go on , scoot !
skedaddle !
get the fuck out of dodge !
god damn .
what the hell' s somebody gotta do ... to get a little decent help up in this motherfucker ?
god damn it .
