axel , there' s something for you
i want to shoot up today , too no way
whether i shoot or sniff , it makes no difference

try and see if you can get one through
you can ditch that one after don' t talk crap
can you lend me your kit ?
keep clear of that , girl

we must stop shooting up
you mustn' t get hooked
i don' t want you to die
mother wonders why i' m not fatter , with aii these sandwiches

you won' t get one from me
don' t be mean .
your pupils are pinheads , yet you tell me to stop

i want to be on the same level as you
o. k. , a small shot
i' il do the next punter for you .
see him ?
he' s crazy about me
don' t go to him
because he has a crush on you
that' il make him pay well
why didn' t you show up ?
no time .
i' ve got a regular guy

a lot of dough
with condoms ?
you can do it with them , too
without you might catch oral clap

he took an overdose in a fit of desperation
one less after the stuff
as long as something' s left to shoot , i' il never take an overjolt
deeply moving farewell letter of seventeen year old andreas w
i know him .
that' s atze
be seeing you

you' il blow , then that makes me puke
that doesn' t leave much
aii right , just jerk me off
for one hundred marks
first the dough

where did you get so much ?
begging didn' t work
i jerked off a guy
he gave me one hundred
are you having me on ?
honest , i only jerked him off
one hundred marks for that ?
what should i have done , then ?
i did it for you
what i told you was true
i did it for you
you did it for yourself , because you were scared of going short
you' d have done it even if i hadn' t existed
this is all because we shoot up
but we' il make it , we' il start to withdraw some time
we' il withdraw with valeron
and i promise i won' t turn tricks with a punter
we' il make it yet
christiane , hurry up

we' il be back soon
that was really something , eh ?
that really was crazy
on the first day already
if we keep it under control , be careful not to get addicted to it
we know now that we can quit
so we can permit ourselves one shot
we could ask them if they have a shot for us
o. k. , let' s ask
axel , don' t you know it' s saturday ?

you old pig , leave me alone
berlin' s youngest drug victim
she was only fourteen !
i survived
mum took me to my gran and auntie , in a village near hamburg
i' ve been clean for eighteen months
it frightens me to think of detlev .
i often think of him
i' d like to give him some of my strength , and help him
but first i need the strength myself
dedicated to andreas w , " atze " , axel w. , babette d , " babsie
and all the others who lacked the strength and luck to survive
