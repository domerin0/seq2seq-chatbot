that' s how it always ends .
a bit of magic , a bit of smoke .
something floating .
but it doesn' t work without the necessary push .
a bit of laughter , a man ... a beautiful woman , and love .
let' s start over .
at the beginning , it was a man alone .
no , he' s not alone .
yet .
that' s the first step .
the man .
laughter comes next .
woman .
love .
look at him .
we can start like that , although this ain' t how it starts .
that' s why you must be quiet .
it' s important , you must believe me .
the man goes into a bar .
he sees the beautiful woman .
do they know each other ?
they don' t seem to know each other , but ... it' s like they recognize one another .
who knows who ?
is that the beginning or the end ?
this is what we' re about to see .
it' s the beginning and the end .
love and goodbye .
i know i don' t need to mention it , but i' m doing it .
remember , everything is just a movie .
a creation .
it hurts , anyway .
hi .
hi .
hi .
will you come ?
yes , to rome .
the plane leaves soon .
we must hurry .
what are you going to do ?
i don' t have much time .
alex .
aimee .
aimee ?
yeah .
like that french girl ?
yes , you know her ?
maybe we should go to paris ?
i don' t think so .
maybe we should wait a little .
yes , i agree .
may i get you something ?
i cup of coffee , please .
aren' t you hungry ?
anything else ?
two coffees please .
excuse me , what exactly is it that you want ?
i just want to go to rome .
i guess ...
thanks .
i guess it' s still early .
we must get to know each other a bit better .
yes , i agree .
i just know that you are too beautiful .
thanks .
if i' m allowed to say that .
yes , you' re allowed .
that' s all you know ?
all i know is that if you' re my dream , then i am yours .
what do you want ?
i wanna say goodbye .
you wanna say goodbye ?
now ?
no .
first i must come inside .
then , i must sit in a table , or in the bar somewhere .
it doesn' t matter .
i' m with a beautiful woman .
i order something to drink ...
i cup of coffee maybe .
i drink it .
i look her in the eyes .
then , i tell her that i love her .
she looks back at me and laughs .
she doesn' t know me , that' s for sure , but i remind her of something .
almost ...
that' s not how i was supposed to leave .
well , i suppose i should .
she looks at me .
she waits .
the night keeps going .
she realizes that i' m not lying .
i really love her .
and that' s it .
that exact moment is the moment when i say " goodbye " .
the time has come .
let' s start over .
it' s not that complicated .
there are four people .
there' s aimee and me , august .
we' re married .
there' s also alex , the photographer , and his girlfriend , simon .
they' re not married .
alex and aimee will get to know each other .
not yet , soon enough .
all of them are looking for love ...
poor kids ...
it will be a great battle .
may the battle begin .
alme at the hllton
it' s very nice , isn' t it ?
very nice .
it' s from monica .
she wants to go down for a drink .
are you listening to me ?
yes , she wants us down for a drink .
now ?
yes .
you want to ?
i' m tired .
i wanted to chat a bit with you .
i' il go , and you' il miss me tonight .
but you have monica .
yes , but just for one drink .
i' il paint .
you go .
are you sure ?
yes .
listen ...
i thought my whole life story .
i know how they' re gonna meet each other .
i' il tell you tomorrow .
you sure you ain' t coming ?
i love you .
me too .
won' t you take your suitcase ?
no , i have everything i need here .
we' il talk again tomorrow .
how are things going ?
what ?
at home .
in your life , love ...
ain' t that what we usually ask ?
everything is fine .
you ?
fine also .
that' s good .
yes , quite good .
what would make you really happy ?
really happy ?
yes , almost complete .
i don' t know , but even if i knew , i wouldn' t do it either .
would you do it against all odds ?
yes , i would .
i dreamed i was with someone else , not simon .
she was nothing special .
she wasn' t so beautiful .
she had nice skin and small tits .
but she was ... so delicate , that was almost silly .
and for some strange reason , i became to be afraid ... that i may hurt her .
i woke up that morning in such a panic .
have i really hurt her ?
honestly .
i was totally ...
i don' t know ...
i was never so afraid of hurting someone .
i felt more responsible for her , than for simon .
take care , ok ?
take care .
you too .
kisses to nan .
and simon .
will you be angry ?
for what ?
if i leave .
i know dad wants to go for a drink , but i don' t want to .
yes , i' m leaving .
excuse me .
i hope he doesn' t get pissed with me .
and excuse you by saying what ?
that my deadline is coming .
your deadline ?
yes , something like that .
stay a bit more .
you never see him .
i don' t want to .
he wants to be with you .
i don' t think so .
of course he does .
i' m not in the mood .
what would you say about us , then ?
is there a chance we go out sometime ?
yes , of course .
really ?
i' il wait for you at the station .
we' il go for a drink , all right ?
see you at the station , then .
my love ...
you' re drowning me .
you' re holding me too tight .
quickly , before he' s here .
yes , all right , see you later .
nice restaurant .
that' s very kind of you .
can we go now ?
where is alex ?
alex had to go .
he apologizes .
is that how he always leaves ?
no .
you know how dedicated he is at what he' s doing .
what do you have to say about that ?
alex is ... sweet .
sweet ?
do you love him ?
yeah .
does he love you ?
do you love me ?
yeah .
why you never say it ?
i say it .
yes , only when i ask .
never by yourself .
i love you .
yes .
bye , simon .
it was good , while it lasted .
indeed .

hello ?
hi , it' s me .

what happened ?
i am your son !
my name is alex david .
i had a very strange day .
that' s why ...
i need you .
you understand me , of course .
you' re my father .
you are crazy .
dad , listen to me !
whatever happens , i love you .

nothing .
everything will go just fine .
you' il go out , and she' il be waiting for you there .
so , you finally made it .
i' m very happy .
wonderful ...
is there something wrong ?
no , everything is fine .
we got a table over there .
all right .
i' m sorry .
thank you .
are you ready ?
here we go .
how many more interviews ?
not that many .
only 3 .
good .
is there something wrong ?
no , on the contrary .
i' m sorry to be asking this , but is she related with alex ?
i haven' t seen her at all .
no , she moved to the city .
she came only to see me .
i suppose she doesn' t have the time of her life , but ...
nothing .
let' s go .
i' m going outside to have a look .
excuse me .
can you ask that gentleman if i can sit with him ?
of course .
excuse me .
that lady asks if she can sit with you .
that one ?
she' s welcome .
i' il tell her so .
you are welcome to join him .
may i ?
please do .
my name is aimee .
alex .
you seemed so nice , and i thought you might need some company .
of course .
are you hungry ?
yes , i haven' t eaten a proper lunch .
nice lighter .
i have it always with me .
you come here often ?
no , i wouldn' t say so .
so , no one knows you here ?
no .
what' s your point ?
i was just wondering about this place .
if you come here often .
what would you prefer ?
i don' t know .
either we sit here ... and watch the menu , even if it' s not needed , ' cause we already know what we want ...
we order , they bring us the food , nice dices , as always ...
we chat a bit , we listen ... maybe not .
we' re not bored , but we feel comfortable with one another .
either this , or ...
or ?
we look at the menu , we ask the waiter to explain it to us ...
we look at each other ...
who are you really ?
i wanna know .
i don' t really know anything , and i want to know all .
what would you prefer ?
can' t i take both ?
maybe ...
why are you so passionate about love ?
i don' t think i am .
your writings are notorious .
it' s because i' m interested in that subject .
men do experience love in a different way , than women do .
i love talking it generally .
i believe that love , basically ... has a different meaning for each one of the two sexes .
for the woman kind , love is necessary .
can' t live without it .
for her , love is a very conscious choice of life .
she chooses to love .
so , love can be someone' s choice ?
yes , ain' t that true ?
romance doesn' t destroy that choice .
from the other hand , us , men kind , we want it to happen suddenly .
without any programming .
because we feel shame of that .
it' s an obstacle .
even as a target , or as a means , love is necessary .
and that' s the right thing .
were you obliged to marry your wife ?
or chose to ?
what was that ?
we left without paying .
without paying ?
didn' t you pay ?
no .
no ?
no !
no ?
you didn' t do that .
oh , yes .
you' re a beautiful crook .
how would you react if i told you i' m falling in love with you ?
is that true ?
would you consider it a bit " too much " ?
no .
what are you doing ?
i' m giving you my ring .
why ?
so we meet again .
what do you mean ?
when i' m gone ...
gone ? ...
i' il be back .
where ?
here .
here ?
yes , this was the place , wasn' t it ?
yes , this was it .
tonight , maybe ?
in a few hours , you mean ?
yes , see you later ...
will we do it then ?
now ?
yes , now .
first , i must say goodbye to someone .
leave a note at the hotel about our meeting time .
so , we go ?
yes , i' il say goodbye now .
you should do the same .
in rome , i want you all for myself .
don' t you worry .
alex ...
i don' t know who you are .
neither do i , basically .
will you ever remember me ?
are you sure ?
i know .
august , i wanna talk to you .
can we sit down for a moment ?
before you say anything , let me show you something .
my love , not now ...
maybe , what you' re about to say ...
i only wanna show you ...
aimee ...
i know i' m not an easy going person .
not now , august .
listen to me .
you must listen to me .
i don' t say often that i love you ... and that you are necessary for me .
i know you' re feeling neglected , but i' m not neglecting you .
it' s because i' m such a difficult person , i want you to see this .
for aimee
without her i would be nothing " .
i really mean that , you know .
aimee , forgive me for being so stupid , but i love you .
i want the two of us to go away .
i' ve already spoken to monica .
i' il do my last lecture tonight , and then we' re off .
we' il go whenever you want .
whenever you like .
it' s your choice .
i can' t ...
i' m sorry .
can you please connect me to aimee holme at room 1235 , please ?
thanks .
may i leave a message ?
meet me at the cafe about 8 " .
write down that i have done the reservation .
no , write down that i have the tickets .
thank you .
bye .
i love you
i hope you know that
don' t you understand ?
that we' ve always loved you ?
always ...
almee at the hllton
one moment .
i' m very happy to see you .
what do you want ?
have seen august anywhere ?
no .
isn' t he having a dinner with you ?
won' t you come too ?
no , i can' t make it .
are you sure you don' t know where he is ?
see you later , aimee .
yeah .
you look nice .
thanks .
see you .
can you talk to me ?
is something wrong between you and august ?
no , everything is fine .
you ain' t leaving him , right ?
i know he would never get over something like that .
i must go , monica .
bye .
alex boble bar
hi , handsome .
are you following me ?
no , i ...
i just came here to see you .
why ?
i came to say " goodbye " .
you should say " hello " first .
come in .
i can' t , i' m not alone .
i' m with you .
come .
no , i just came to say " goodbye " .
goodbye ...
there are no words when i' m with you " .
goodbye " .
excuse me .
have you seen someone around 30 , tall , with black hair ?
unfortunately no .
ok , thanks .
amy krashnapolski alex boble bar
i really must go now .
stay just a little more .
don' t you remember me at all ?
no .
where are you , alex ?
come .
i must call somewhere .
say something beautiful .
you are adorable .
i must call somewhere .
excuse me , may i have some change to make a phone call ?
what' s the problem with the phone ?
must be broken .
i must go .
no !
yes , i' m sorry .
are you leaving me ?
yes .
goodbye , simon .
will you kiss me ?
a goodbye kiss .
a unique moment .
krashnapolski here ...
can you see a woman with blond hair in the cafe ?
she' s from sweden , around 25 years old ...
no , sir , we' re full .
it' s important .
look around .
i' m sorry , sir , i have no time .
it' s simple .
blonde and beautiful .
her name is aimee , she speaks swedish .
it' s impossible not to notice her .
man , i don' t see her right now .
it' s crowded .
call later if you want .
did you see a blonde woman here somewhere ?
she speaks swedish .
she came and go ?
my love ...
you never came .
i' m sorry .
i' il do anything to make it up to you again .
you never came .
no ... no .
i was confused .
i had to reconsider the whole situation first .
alex hesitated at a very critical point .
he loses aimee .
the last person that was left for him .
the only one .
can their love survive ?
what will it take ?
a test .
for him and for her .
his love for her .
stupid ?
maybe .
if he steps back ... if he doubts ... she will disappear .
not now .
monica is at the reception .
how are you ?
what are you doing here ?
i don' t understand it .
our plane is leaving .
in one hour we' re leaving .
who ?
me and my husband .
why are you playing ?
what kind of game is this ?
my husband is waiting for me .
knock it off .
aimee , you know me .
i know for sure .
look at me .
we love each other .
let' s take another flight .
let' s leave tomorrow .
we can still leave ...
knock it off !
you know who i am .
i' m sorry , i' m expected .
i love you ...
we must go now .
i' il talk to them .
what happened there ?
some young man , nothing .
he thought he knew you ?
he thought he loved me .
lovely .
was he irritating ?
no , not at all .
time is pressing us , you know .
goodbye , aimee ...
the woman left .
the laughter stopped .
but the man is still here .
not like that ...
all alone .
look at him ...
it' s all just a movie .
a creation .
anyway , it hurts .
the end
