the kingdom hospital rests on ancient marshland where the bleaching ponds once lay .
here the bleachers moistened their great spans of cloth .
the steam evaporating from the wet cloth shrouded the place in permanent fog .
centuries later the hospital was built here .
the bleachers gave way to doctors and researchers , the best brains in the nation and the most perfect technology .
to crown their work they called the hospital the kingdom .
now life was to be charted , and ignorance and superstition never to shake the bastions of science again .
perhaps their arrogance became too pronounced , and their persistent denial of the spiritual .
for it is as if the cold and damp have returned .
tiny signs of fatigue are appearing in the solid , modern edifice .
no living person knows it yet , but the gateway to the kingdom is opening once again .
thy kingdom come
good morning ...
my poor wee chap !
what' s happened ?
let me guess ...
oh my god !
your donald duck magazine hasn' t arrived .
how the hell are you going to pass the time now ?
oh , i' il find some jobs to do .
no , no , no panicky solutions .
where' s the boss ?
no idea .
of course not .
but the doctors car park is an earthquake zone .
it was a great experience .
we must find her again .
she needs me .
urgently .
where do you think you are going ?
mrs drusse is in hospital .
ln the hospital , mrs drusse has a bed .
lt' s in bed i want to see mrs drusse , and nowhere else .
consultant neurosurgeon hook told me i could walk about a bit .
wait ...
just who is consultant neurosurgeon hook ?
him ? ...
well i' il be damned .
you , a consultant neurosurgeon ?
mrs drusse , you are seriously ill .
there' s never been a body fluid count like yours ...
sister !
consultant neurosurgeon hook says give this patient a saline drip in her own bed .
a slow one .
helmer ?
it is l .
your diplomacy didn' t work .
mona' s mother has complained .
a good thing you' re in the lodge .
lots of the brethren are on the general medical council .
we' il discuss the complaint at morning conference .
it' s better than letting rumours fly .
then it' il look as if i' ve found a few ways out but don' t want to burden the staff .
that' s a trick you could use .
they all think you' re a bit harsh .
but i think the complaint will be of benefit to you here .
it' il make you seem more human .
what makes you like denmark , specially ?
dr. helmer joined us two months ago , and we' re proud to have this internationally acclaimed neurosurgeon here .
sadly , dr. helmer is already having to become acquainted with one of the less attractive areas of danish medicine , namely patient complaints .
as some of you recall problems arose in connection with an operation he performed on mona somethingorother just after he joined us .
a complaint has been lodged and i' d like to ask you all to give him your support .
ln this context i' d like to raise a minor problem to which i think it reasonable for the staff to propose solutions .
uncertainty has been expressed visavis working with dr. helmer .
stig may find it peculiar that we address such things together .
but if operation morning breeze is to justify its existence we must also let the morning air into our personal spheres .
perhaps you do things differently in sweden ...
yes .
oh .
any suggestions as to how to counter this uncertainty visavis working with dr. helmer ?
yes ?
communication .
splendid .
splendid .
communication ... does anyone else feel communication' s the problem ?
he never says anything , and when he does it' s in swedish .
we probably can' t solve the swedish problem right away .
let' s hear what dr. helmer has to say .
what ?
how do you feel we can improve communication with you ?
how should i know ?
would it help to call you stig ?
be more personal ?
excuse me , i have work to do .
operations , and other trivial tasks .
of course ...
1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ...
this plate is unclean .
the walls have been flaking .
can' t you do something ?
no , nothing .
oh , dear .
we' il have to wash them again .
it' il wash off easily .
there are other things that can' t be washed off .
what do you mean ?
blood ?
some blood can be washed off and some blood cannot .
tell me , are you crazy ?
no girl will ever be interested in anyone so childish .
poor sanne !
whatever were you thinking of ?
i thought i knew you .
but you' ve got the charm of a turd .
you' d better put that head back where it came from .
of course .
good ... ...
not that it' s my affair .
and i never want to see you again .
shove off .
i' il miss the operation .
professor bondo wants to see me .
oh .
did you screw up ?
why ?
well , he' s summoned you , hasn' t he ?
run along , then .
i see you' ve asked to see me later , too .
can i go , too ?
lf you want to be a doctor , you' il have to watch an operation .
what if i watched through the window ?
to kind of get used to it ?
why isn' t the patient asleep ?
hello .
may .
i am assisting here .
may " ?
the patient reacts to anaesthesia .
this gentleman is going to hypnotise the patient .
it' s so exciting !
the hell it is .
einar !
where are the funny noses ?
what do you mean , stig ?
you are a circus manager and we clowns want noses .
red ones , with elastic bands .
this clown appears in my theatre and says he has a job to do .
the hypnotist ... of course you should have been informed .
the patient reacts to anaesthesia .
rigmor can tell you more .
scruples about operating because of the mona complaint ?
it' s like riding . lf you fall , you get straight back on .
mona has got nothing to do with it .
i' m pleased to hear it .
but you must admit this is exciting .
hypnoanaesthesia !
purely scientifically ...
after all , it' s related to your article in the lancet .
though you' d know that better than i do , since you wrote it .
by the way , have a handful of the morning breeze stickers you recommended i had printed .
they' re super .
how are you ?
where did you get to ?
i' ve had work to do .
i' m tired of lying here .
a spirit is calling .
i must search .
there' s nothing wrong with me .
you' ve changed your tune .
i can walk .
sad about the drip .
yes , if i didn' t have a porter in the family .
relax , relax .
you are feeling drowsy .
ln a moment you won' t be able to feel anything .
at first in your skin , then your whole head on the count of three ...
one ... two ... three .
scalpel .
by the way , i dropped into the clothes store .
pean .
it was very clear that you had borrowed a dressing gown .
dressing gowns are for the patients ... ... not the staff .
hand it back immediately .
ln sweden you' d have been given very short shrift .
do you understand ?
i thought the patient was asleep .
he should have been .
whether my patient is under anaesthetic or not , whether he' s under hypnosis or he has just been knocked out with a blunt instrument is totally irrelevant .
but he must keep his mouth shut .
relax , you feel marvellous .
all the pain has gone , everything is over .
come in , mogge .
i have good news and i have bad news .
the good news is that i have no proof .
the bad news is that if i get the slightest evidence
linking a certain stolen body part with your personage will result not only in your immediate expulsion but also to my calling the police .
i hope you have left no trace .
a pathologist is a blood hound by profession .
i have no more time for you .
real life has summoned me .
hello , my name is dr. bondo .
you are related to mr. zakariasen ?
he' s my husband .
this is our son .
i am not the doctor who treated your husband , i' m a pathologist .
i requested this interview .
are we to talk in front of him ?
mrs. zakariasen , your husband cannot hear what we say .
what do you want to say ?
new legislation requires that you consent to dissection .
what' s a dissection ?
he wants to cut daddy up , mum .
without autopsies we' d still be in the stone age .
dad is still alive .
or is that just a formality ?
dissection would only take place after death .
would you mind telling us what your personal interests in this case are ?
am i right in thinking they go beyond those of general medicine ?
your father has a hepatoma .
i think my research has achieved important results , but for a decade i have had no specimen to work on .
i need your father' s liver to conclude my research .
so your beautiful thoughts on benefiting humanity are more to do with your own career .
we can' t really take your problem seriously .
i find your request rather distasteful .
my research may improve the treatment of hepatomas .
it might prevent others from suffering like this .
with one patient a decade
i doubt if society would pay for any new form of treatment .
nobody can argue that dissection doesn' t make sense .
we' re not arguing .
we' re just saying no .
we' d like to be alone with dad now .
right .
will the junior registrar close him up ?
didn' t you hear me ?
please close him up .
communication problems ?
all right , put his lid on .
actually , communications aren' t the problem .
the problem is qualifications , hook .
hook !
you ... you must always ... ... obey professor tribini .
professor tribini will count to three .
one , two , three and whoops !
all of a sudden you are a good doctor .
or what , hook ?
he has withdrawn my funds for a phase contrast microscope .
he says savings must be made .
yet just look at the waste ...
listen carefully .
you can hear my voice .
ln a moment i' il count to three and you will wake up .
you will feel marvellous .
you' il feel no pain .
you' il feel marvellous .
you' il be yourself again .
i' il count slowly to three , and on three you' il wake up .
one , two ...
three .
now open your eyes slowly ...
i' d like to talk to the doctor who did the operation .
there was a girl ...
a girl ?
yes .
a little girl .
she was kind .
i was upset , and she stroked my hand .
do you know her ?
the doctor who' s just gone out ?
yes , that' s judith .
the little girl pointed at her and said " family " .
family ?
hi , bulder .
hi , drusse .
what are you up to ?
looking for the ghost .
why not take bongo ?
he howls when he hears that ambulance .
really ?
i' m not taking a dog .
it' s bad enough pushing my mum mile after mile .
you' re a good boy , bulder .
i' m sick of pushing this bed about .
i' ve been pushing it all day .
and dogs aren' t allowed here .
lf we push him round in this , nobody will ever know .
he' s picked up the scent .
where are we now ?
below m.
lnfectious medicine .
what now ?
she' s here .
hi , mogge .
did i miss a swedish screwup ?
why do i suddenly like you ? ...
what did you want ?
you wanted guinea pigs for the sleep lab .
are you sure you' d want to ?
it' s heavy stuff .
we test new sleep control drugs .
ok by me .
you get 150 per sleep period .
we do an ecg to measure which brain centres are activated while you dream .
then you describe the process .
ok by me .
fine .
report to the cage .
you said helmer had taken away your microscope ?
i can apply again next year .
that' s crazy .
i think so , too .
i' ve a better idea .
where are we going ?
i want to show you something .
everything looks fine .
the hypnoanaesthesia was apparently highly effective .
you say you didn' t notice the operation , or any discomfort ?
no discomfort .
but there was a little girl .
ln the operating theatre ?
yes .
she tried to talk to the doctor doing the operation , but he wouldn' t listen .
she tried to talk to helmer ?
yes ... he wouldn' t listen .
and i think i know why .
wouldn' t listen to what ?
her little bell .
why not ?
because it was the death bell .
what bloody nonsense !
don' t let it bother you .
i don' t .
i take no notice of any of the nonsense here .
professor bondo just phoned .
he wants to address the lodge .
i' m trying to scrape some brethren together for tonight .
i can' t take this damned crap .
her little bell !
the death bell !
pull in here .
hello , hook .
hi , hansen .
hi , bulder .
any news ?
you' ve been for quite a walk with mrs. drusse .
that drip ran out hours ago .
bongo !
bongo !
come here !
dogs aren' t allowed in hospitals !
this is where i live .
oh , you don' t really .
yes , i do .
it' s just practical .
most of my friends work down here .
ln the passageways and kitchens round about .
i like living here , don' t get me wrong .
what if you get found out ?
i have been .
we have a tacit agreement .
i fix things for the hospital and the hospital leaves me alone .
there' s a lot of wastage , and that' s not a good thing .
helmer said you' d stolen a dressing gown .
ls it anything to do with that ?
it' s an excellent example .
but he got it wrong .
it wasn' t just one dressing gown .
it was hundreds .
dressing gowns were piling up at neurosurgery .
they took up room .
so i dealt with them .
how ?
i redirect them .
redirect them ?
to wards where they' re needed .
lemon ?
yes , please .
what' s in it for you ?
i don' t get anything out of it .
i just don' t like ...
i' m happy when things aren' t wasted .
ethyl alcohol and distilled water .
the cleanest drink you can get .
per , this is hook .
at k5006 there' s a whole pile of equipment .
will you look for ...
what was it you wanted ?
a phase contrast microscope . ...
a phase contrast microscope .
hmm ?
great .
see you later .
what' s that ?
hey , that' s spooky !
maybe it is .
i got the idea from professor ulrich in gastrosurgery .
we all have own private cemetery " .
each tray represents one of the senior doctors here .
and each cross is a death ?
not likely , or i' d be busy !
no , each cross represents a death or injury caused by medical negligence .
there' s just not that number of mistakes reported .
reported , no , and i don' t tell the world about it either .
but one day i might find a use for my knowledge .
that was quick , lads .
put it over here .
a present from the kingdom .
i begin to see how you got that tacit agreement ...
it' il soon be dark .
yes , evening is falling .
and when night comes , we shall sleep .
there' s something i don' t understand .
what don' t you understand ?
lf the little girl from the lift is kind and good , why does the old woman want to chase her away ?
the little girl is unhappy .
she cannot rest .
we sleep when night falls .
she never sleeps .
oh ?
she needs help so she can rest .
yes ?
i wondered if you' d come and sit with mrs. mogensen ?
she' s such a sweet old lady , and she' s interested in spiritualism .
you haven' t heard ...
she had another turn this morning .
the doctor expects her to pass away tonight .
i am sorry .
i had such a nice time with mrs. mogensen .
she asked for you earlier , but you weren' t in your room .
now she keeps slipping in and out of consciousness .
but i think she' d appreciate your company .
of course .
a cup of coffee ?
no , thanks .
i' il stick to my crossword , even if i can' t do it .
just ring if you are afraid .
my dear girl , i shan' t be afraid .
i have sat with the dying before .
the jaw drops and that' s that .
it can be very peaceful .
ls that you , mrs. drusse ?
yes , it' s me , emma .
where did you get to ?
i was ghost hunting .
how i loved you , mrs. drusse !
and all your spirits .
all your zany spirits .
i have been very fond of you , too .
do they say i' m dying ?
yes .
are you afraid ?
a little .
don' t be afraid , emma .
you' re just passing over to all those zany spirits .
quite true .
it is a spiritualist' s duty to die .
i' il be coming soon .
i' m an old biddy myself .
you aren' t old .
stuff and nonsense .
but let' s not argue , eh , emma ?
eh , little emma ?
i think i' il sleep a bit .
that' s right , emma .
come on !
rigmor !
your tenderness ...
your tenderness , your warmth .
i don' t deserve them .
you do , stig .
no .
i am a weakling .
but i can handle those thickheads .
even their moronic operation morning breeze .
but that mona business is getting to me .
because you are under pressure .
all men are under pressure .
but all you need is a woman to feed you well and give you some of the herbal remedies i' ve mentioned .
nietzsche lived off them , or at least wrote about them .
you are fantastic .
you exploit my weaknesses .
you do !
you are forcing your witchcraft on me .
first came a book about haiti .
then a trip to haiti i should treat you to .
stop putting up so much resistance .
i want to look after you .
you know i love you .
yes .
quietly does it !
stig ...
what' s on your mind ?
i' d like an honest answer ...
of course .
did you really say i had a backside like a chest of drawers ?
who said that ?
never you mind .
did you ?
of course not .
good .
are you moving your things over ?
eh ?
hi , pop .
he' s a good boy .
i told you to stay away .
the toothbrush isn' t for you .
i' ve come to sleep .
don' t be silly .
look at your papers .
ok .
but you' il have to sleep .
i' m not allowed to talk to the guinea pigs .
i' ve come to sleep , not talk .
fine .
change in there .
bondo ...
dear brethren ,
i have never previously exercised my right to convene you .
so you will understand the gravity of my problem .
you know i set great store by my research , despite the friendly teasing about my lack of hepatomas .
and that' s the point .
after a ten year wait , a wonderful hepatoma has popped up .
the tumor will allow me to conclude my research but i can' t have it !
the patient , who is on professor ulrich' s ward , is dying .
but the family refuses to allow dissection .
there' s nothing i can do .
so near , and yet so far !
i have a freeze dried sample , but i need the whole tumor .
to the very last i hoped that an operation would be performed thus placing the tumour in my hands .
i know it was wishful thinking , professor , for the tumor is inoperable .
but nevertheless ...
i no longer delude myself that a solution will appear from nowhere .
so i have convened you to ask for help .
help me to help medical science !
haven' t you finished yet ?
there .
i can' t sleep .
don' t worry , you will .
turn over .
goodnight .
ghost hunting ...
of course you' ve been ghost hunting !
did you speak , emma ?
tell me about it ...
do tell ...
what shall i tell you ?
we searched everywhere .
but she didn' t reveal her presence everywhere .
to announce her presence she rings a little bell .
where ?
where ?
everywhere .
do you think it might be of some significance ?
it was at gynaecology .
ward y.
and then at respiratory diseases ...
and on a ...
medicine .
you mustn' t go , mrs. drusse .
i am right beside you , emma .
i think it will be soon .
ls there anything you want me to do , mrs. drusse on the other side ?
yes , of course .
find my ghost , talk to her .
ask her why she is so unhappy and what i can do about it .
what' s her name ?
i don' t know , but i expect you' il find her anyway .
ghosts are in the state in between .
ln swedenborg space .
but you won' t stay there long , you will want to cross it into the light .
but try and stay there a couple of minutes .
they will call you from the light , and tug at you .
but try to delay your crossing and answer me , emma .
i' il do my best .
thank you , emma , you' re very kind .
i' m not meant to tell you how the mona affair is progressing , but i got a furious letter from the chief medical officer today .
apparently the anaesthesia report was destroyed .
the cmo wants to see the anaesthetist' s notes .
blood pressure , and so on .
that' s the bad thing about being a manager .
what is the bad thing about being a manager ?
management , damn it !
bondo is in a most unfortunate situation .
it would look good if you could help ...
me ?
the lodge likes active brethren .
specially just after initiation .
poor bondo .
yes , poor chap .
i' m no psychiatrist , but anyone can see he is madly insane .
his speech is incoherent , he dribbles , yes , he' s bonkers .
you mustn' t say that , stig , you' re a scientist yourself .
moreover , a brother' s cry for help will always be heard however insignificant the matter may appear to be .
give bondo' s problem some thought .
you' re so creative , you nervous types .
the more you stand by bondo , the more the lodge will stand by you .
this is where we part .
you can find the lift again ?
don' t let the mona affair dent your good humour .
creative !
emma ...
keep listening , and i' il talk you through .
i am beside you .
let go , emma , but don' t fall too far .
stay in the state in between !
stay in the state in between .
don' t leave swedenborg space !
answer me ...
very good , emma .
we must hurry .
one flash , no .
two , don' t know .
three , yes .
are they tugging at you from inside the light , emma ?
ls it beautiful in the light ?
we' re wasting our time .
have you found her ?
no ?
you need a name ?
really , emma ?
ward y ...
and a ...
mary .
mary .
her name is mary , emma .
ls her name mary ?
fine ! ls she with you ?
no ?
what shall i ask about , then ?
where can i find out ?
ls there anywhere ?
but where , emma ?
ln this hospital ?
hold on , emma , hold on !
everything in this hospital has a number .
give me a number before you disappear ...
first digit 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 .
second digit , 1 , 2 , 3 .
third digit , 1 , 2 ... 532 ...
thank you , emma .
that was kind of you .
good evening .
can you tell me about mary ?
no , i don' t know anyone called mary .
whose is the other bed ?
mrs. krger' s .
she' s in the pool .
they couldn' t stand the way she went on pleading and pleading so they opened the pool , even though it was late .
but you won' t get much out of talking to her .
she' s completely gaga .
old and gaga ...
thanks .
goodnight .
who is mary ?
my name' s ellen .
daddy gave me a new dolly today .
how old are you , ellen ?
nine .
do you know mary ?
mary is ill .
she' s in daddy' s hospital .
she coughs .
her chest is poorly .
she has a hump .
mary has a hump .
what year is this ?
1919 , of course .
lsn' t dolly' s hair lovely ?
her name is mary , too .
it says " mary " here .
would you like to see my daddy ?
he' s a doctor .
yes , please .
the picture is under the pillow in the pram .
ls that you next to your father ?
no , that' s mary .
they wrote a song about her .
shall i sing it ?
may i borrow your picture ?
ln a ward in hospital
ln a white bed there
lay a little girl who coughed
sick and pale , with golden hair .
lay a little girl who coughed
sick and pale , with golden hair .
every heart she stole away
as she lay there sweet and good

stig ?
hi .
where is the lift ?
or the stairs ?
say hello to my friend .
he spent his childhood in haiti .
he can tell you all about zombies .
he tends the animals .
lf i have to choose between zombies and the stairs ,
i' il take the stairs .
i had a nasty dream .
the questionnaire ...
i haven' t time .
no money , then .
evening , madsen .
hello , bulder .
any activity ?
no , it' s been very quiet .
kingdom security here . ...
just a minute .
it' s that call again !
record it , damn it !
this is stretcher van 12 .
we' re heading down lyngby road towards the kingdom .
with horn and flashing lights ...
stretcher vans ?
that was 100 years ago .
call the police .
those calls come every night .
bongo ...
bongo , nice doggy ...
bulder !
her name is mary .
mary .
a helping hand from copenhagen " .
last week professor aage krger returned to his home town to tell 6 year old mary jensen she could be treated free of charge at the kingdom .
mary is looking forward to visiting the capital .
here she thanks the professor ...
there' s a photo of her .
mary had a little lamb ...
hello .
thanks for the microscope .
i' m not busy tonight .
i thought you would be , now you' ve got it .
what about that research ?
i know i' ve been playing hard to get , and i do like you .
but i was in love with somebody else .
and ... now you' re not ?
i don' t know .
he left a few months ago , i don' t think he' il be back .
it' s not a problem for me .
did you really think it would be ?
it' s not that simple .
i' m pregnant .
ok .
ls that good or bad ?
good .
i want a baby .
his baby .
but i thought it might complicate things for you .
listen , sweetie .
i' m mad about you .
pregnant or not .
lf you have the baby , i' il love it , too .
you thought i wouldn' t if it wasn' t mine ?
maybe i did .
what an idiot !
who ?
the bloke who ran off and left such a lovely girl .
aage ...
yes .
aage .
what an arsehole !
what' s the matter ?
i went all dizzy .
of course , you' re pregnant .
and i' d already forgotten .
lie down .
we must take your temperature .
because i' m pregnant ?
some doctor !
be quiet , we can' t be careful enough .
and it might go up a degree or two ...
our forests are fresh and big , cuckoo , cuckoo , faldera .
hans christian andersen , danish national poet .
cuckoo , cuckoo , faldera .
they' re not just idiots .
they' re deadly dangerous .
danish scum .
bongo ...
lf mary' s who we' re looking for , where' s her little lamb ?
it' s the dog .
well , that was part 2 of the kingdom .
i' d like to thank you again for watching our little series .
mrs. drusse continues to slavishly follow all the clues knowing they may lead her into trouble .
i am very happy with part 2 and i' d call it poetic and captivating .
maybe you think the story is predictable and depressing .
lf so , look at your own life .
ls it monotonous and humdrum ?
yes ?
then enjoy the comfort of the familiar .
but if your life is exciting , enjoy this break from the caviar with its view of the trivia you have surely out behind you .
my name is lars von trier and i wish you a very good evening .
should you wish to revisit the kingdom be prepared to take the good with the evil !
