sheriff , it' s pete martell up at the mill .
i' m going to transfer it to the phone on the table by the red chair .
the red chair against the wall .

sorry .
harry , let' s roll her over .
good lord , laura !
laura palmer .
laura , sweetheart , i' m not going to tell you again .
yes , i am .
for goodness ' sake .
laura , now means now .
laura , honey , are you downstairs ?
hello .
beth , it' s sarah .
i just went up to wake laura and she' s not here .
is she with bobby ?
she could be .
he goes running at 5 : 00 am and then he goes to football practice .
can you find out ?
can you reach him ?
i' il call the school .
i' ve got the number of the field office here .
thanks , beth .
i wonder if she went out with leland ?
he had an early meeting .
i' m sure that' s it .
either that or she' s with bobby .
sure .
i' il call up to the hotel .
thanks .
no , bobby hasn' t shown up for practice yet today .
as a matter of fact , he' s been late every day this week , mrs palmer .
and last week .
maybe even the week before .
are they ready to sign ?
you' re not going to mention that we haven' t yet acquired access to the packard land ?
sorry .
we have solid information that the packard sawmill is going to go belly up within a year .
we' il be able to get it for a song .
one verse , no chorus .
now ...
let' s get out there and get those cheese eaters where they live .
benjamin .
... a clean , wholesome environment , much like your own .
with a quality of life to rival the very best that this country has to offer .
that is what the ghostwood country club and estates will be .
when i first spoke to sven , he was naturally very concerned about the quality of air here .
my air sacks have never felt so good !
your wife' s on the phone again .
she said it' s urgent .
excuse me a moment , gentlemen .
i' il be right back .
make it snappy .
so ... ... here in twin peaks , health and industry go hand in hand .
i' il transfer you to the house phone .
thank you .
sarah , what is it ?
is laura with you ?
no , why ?
she didn' t go with you this morning ?
no .
honey , what' s wrong ?
what' s this all about ?
she wasn' t here this morning .
she' s probably with bobby .
i can' t find bobby .
there you are .
that' s it .
let' s not worry .
they' re probably together .
she would have left me a note .
she would have told me .
honey , take it easy , please .
i' m looking for leland palmer .
he' s right over there on the phone .
sheriff truman .
what ?
who ?
what did you say ?
oh , my god .
oh , my god !
leland , please .
what is it ?
tell me .
leland ...
is this about laura ?
i' m afraid it is .
leland , tell me .
my baby !
we' re ready to go with the contracts .
leland , what' s wrong ?
my daughter' s dead .
what kept you , heidi ?
i couldn' t get my car started .
too busy jump starting the old man ?
i thought you germans were always on time .
i thought the only time you cared about , bobby , was making time .
you heading out , shelly ?
yeah , i' m heading home .
i' m going to practice .
i can drop you on the way .
that would be great , thanks .
here' s a tune for you , gals .
norma ... ... l' il see you in my dreams .
not if i see you first .
don' t do anything i wouldn' t do .
i think she knows about us .
norma ?
fat chance .
i think she' s hot to try for you herself .
it' s happy hour in france .
come on , cowboy .
light your fire .
right , just a little pick me up before homeroom .
i thought i was your little pick me up .
baby , you are more like a three stage rocket .
a pocket rocket .
and what stage are we in now ?
are you sure that your old man is still on the road ?
yes , he called me last night from butte .
that' s a long way away and he ain' t got a phone in his truck .
quit worrying and start screwing , mr touchdown .
butte !
back up !
i' il call you later .
leland , i' m so sorry .
17 years old .
lee , i hate to put you through this .
no , i have to see her .
i have to see what was done to my little girl .
my baby !
that' s my little girl .
god !
let' s get out of here .

... making the announcement .
thank you for your time .
there' il be an announcement from the principal .
i told you .
i got up early like i always do .
i went running like i always do .
i had breakfast at the rr and i didn' t go to practice because i didn' t feel like it .
why not , bobby ?
were you upset about something ?
you want to tell us about it ?
look , you guys , what did i do ?
what' s going on ?
mr wolchezk , there' s rumours all over school .
maybe it' s best if they heard it from you .
mr wolchezk , why don' t you go ahead and make that announcement ?
now ?
now' s the time .
excuse me .
what is it , sheriff ?
what' s going on ?
bobby , you look at me .
your girlfriend laura palmer' s been killed .
she was found just after dawn .
she was with you last night .
you weren' t where you should have been this morning .
have these fellows advised you of your rights ?
yes , but i didn' t know why .
laura' s dead ?
yes .
did you understand your rights as they were explained to you ?
you think i killed her ?
bobby , you can phone your parents and they can arrange for a lawyer to be with you when we talk again .
andy , take bobby out to make his call .
i loved her .
and she loved me .
because i wasn' t at football practice i killed my girlfriend ?
you are crazy !
you get off me .
bobby , we' re going to talk about this later .
may i have your attention , please .
this is principal wolchezk .
i am deeply saddened to have to tell you that early this morning your classmate laura palmer was found dead .
this is a terrible moment for all of us .
for all of us who knew her .
her friends , her family .
it is very important that we all try to help each other through this difficult time .
the police have asked me to ask each of you if you have any information about laura' s activities after school yesterday or yesterday evening , please come forward .
i am dismissing all classes for the day , but before we leave i would like to ask each of you to join me in a moment of silence for laura and her dear memory .
you can talk to her now , harry .
do you know what time it was when you last saw laura , mrs palmer ?
what time ?
yes .
it would have been about nine .
yes , nine o' clock ...
... pm .
she came home from bobby' s and she was going up the stairs .
those stairs ... right there .
who' s upstairs ?
your husband and one of my men .
i can tell from the sounds that it isn' t her .
her diary .
do you know where the key to this is , sir ?
do you have to take that ?
we' il return it as soon as possible .
did she say anything to you ?
no .
she said goodnight .
and i said , " goodnight .
goodnight , sweetheart .
mrs palmer , can you remember ...
did she make or receive any phone calls ?
i heard her phone ring once .
about what time was that ?
i don' t know who it was .
harry .
that was lucy .
got a call from a guy who works at the mill , janek pulaski .
says his daughter didn' t come home last night and she didn' t show up at school today , either .
two by fours , four by eights .
two by fours , four by eights .
did you hear me ?
you can' t do that to my workers .
don' t walk away from me .
come back here .
you' re not going anywhere .
you' re not going to tell anybody anything .
catherine ,
i' m sorry if this offends you , but i' m the owner of this sawmill .
you don' t knowthe first thing about this mill .
that' s why i' m running it .
i' ve never taken this authority before , but maybe i should have .
you' re not shutting us down .
catherine , i have the final say so .
peter , push the plug .
pete , don' t you dare .
catherine , please .
shorty , tell the boys to pull the plug .
that' s right .
may i have your attention .
this is josie packard .
i have decided that in light of what has happened , all work here will stop .
bitch !
this morning , as you know , the body of miss laura palmer ...
what' s your name ?
fred truax e .
you' re fired .
just now your co worker and a friend , mr janek pulaski , has learned that his daughter , one of laura' s schoolmates , is missing since last night .
today all work here will stop .
the mill will shut down .
perhaps you can spend the day with your families .
thank you all for your attention .
what the hell ?
laura' s dead .
yeah , i heard .
she was the one .
buy you a coffee ?
can' t do it .
if you see donna , could you give this to her ?
ed !
they said those drapes would be ready by 10 : 00 .
i want those drapes up by nightfall .
diane , 11 : 30 am , february 24th .
i' m entering the town of twin peaks .
five miles south of the canadian border , 12 miles west of the state line .
i' ve never seen so many trees in my life .
as wc fields would say , " i' d rather be here than philadelphia .
54 degrees on a slightly overcast day .
weatherman said rain .
if you get paid for being wrong 60/ of the time , it' d beat working !
mileage is 79, 345 .
gauge is on reserve .
got to tank up when i get into town .
remind me to tell you how much that is .
lunch was $6 and 31 cents at the lamplighter inn .
that' s on highway 2 , near lewis fork .
that was a tuna fish sandwich , slice of cherry pie and a cup of coffee .
damn good food !
if you ever get up here , that cherry pie is worth a stop .
looks like i' il be meeting up with a ...
sheriff harry s truman .
shouldn' t be too hard to remember .
he' il be at the calhoun memorial hospital .
guess we' il take a look at that girl who crawled down off the mountain .
i' m sure the sheriff can recommend a clean , reasonably priced motel .
that' s what i need : a clean place , reasonably priced .
diane , i almost forgot .
i' ve got to find out what trees these are .
they' re really something .
agent cooper ?
yes .
sheriff harry s truman .
dale cooper , fbl .
pleasure .
good to meet you .
have any trouble finding the place ?
no , no .
fine .
came out over highway 2 near lewis fork .
stopped at the lamplighter inn .
had a slice of cherry pie .
incredible .
i' il tell you , we' re sure glad to have the fbi here .
kind of lucky in a way that ronnette stepped out across the state line .
whole town' s badly shaken up .
sure , it' s a nice quiet place .
sheriff , let me stop you for just a second .
there' s a fewthings we' ve got to get straight .
it' s best to talk about this up front .
when the bureau gets called in , the bureau' s in charge .
you' il be working for me .
sometimes local law enforcement has a problem with that .
we' re glad to have you here .
sheriff , what kind of fantastic trees have you got growing round here ?
big , majestic ...
douglas firs .
douglas firs ?
can someone get me a copy of the coroner' s report on the dead girl ?
the autopsy hasn' t been done yet , but i' il take you down to the morgue when we' re finished here .
fine .
dr shelvy , this is fbi agent cooper .
glad to know you .
doctor .
how' s the girl ?
she' s in shock , suffering from exposure .
can i see her ?
all right , this way .
was she raped ?
several times .
one perpetrator ?
we' re waiting for the results .
is there any connection to the dead girl ?
same high school .
as far as we know , they hardly knew each other .
no connection .
i' d like to question her .
this girl doesn' t even know where she is or if she is .
what exactly are you saying ?
we need a cat scan and we' re not equipped for that here .
my opinion ?
she may have neurological damage .
she' s not responsive at all .
i' d like to examine her fingers .
all right .
they' ve already scraped for particles .
that' s not what i' m looking for .
there' s nothing here , not a thing .
don' t go there .
don' t go there .
ronnie ?
ronnette ?
pull the fish out of the water , big mouth .
he' s got a big mouth that starts talking to me .
harry !
dr jacoby .
terrible , terrible tragedy .
yes .
this is special agent dale cooper .
gary cooper ?
agent cooper .
agent ?
fbl .
right .
dr lawrence jacoby , agent cooper .
laura was a patient of mine .
you' re going to the morgue .
do you mind if i join you ?
yes , i do .
why would you want to ?
sort of against procedure , doctor .
no offence .
i thought i could be of some help .
you still could be ... at another time .
i understand completely .
by the way ...
laura' s ... laura' s parents .
they didn' t know that she was seeing me .
that guy' s a psychiatrist ?
i have to apologise again for the fluorescent lights .
i think it' s a bad transformer .
that' s quite all right .
agent cooper , we scraped those nails when we brought her in .
there it is .
there it is .
my god , here it is !
what ?
would you leave us , please ?
jim .
would you leave us alone , please ?
certainly .
i need something to grab onto this with .
diane , i' m at the twin peaks county morgue with the body of the victim .
laura palmer .
diane , it' s the same thing .
i told you we' d see this again .
what have you got there ?
ring finger , under the nail .
let' s see what he left us .
it' s an ' r ' .
diane , give this to albert and his team .
don' t go to sam .
albert has a bit more on the ball .
ok , cooper , are you going to let me in on what' s going on here ?
sheriff , we' ve got a lot to talk about .
hi , ed .
hey , donna .
i' m so sorry .
have you seen james yet ?
he came by .
is he ok ?
no .
do you know where he went ?
i' ve already been to the roadhouse .
i don' t know , honey .
he told me to give you this .
what the hell are you doing ?
i' ve been looking all over for you .
bobby' s in a lot of trouble .
he' s my best friend .
we' re going to the police station to be with him .
don' t tell me where i ought to be !
second , laura was my best friend .
get in the car .
muffle it , junior .
mind your own business .
you' re on my lot , friend .
ed , i' m not your friend .
donna , you get to the sheriff' s right now .
i sure know howto pick them .
you waiting for those drapes to hang themselves ?
i know howto pick them , too .
if james comes around , will you tell him i' m looking for him ?
you bet .
and donna , you take it easy .
that' s the videotape we just saw , the one we found in laura' s bedroom .
at a certain point , i' m going to want to showthis to the boyfriend .
you say when .
did you complete your forensics ?
you bet .
all done .
no key yet ?
we' re still looking .
why not ?
diane , i' ve just opened laura palmer' s diary .
this is the last entry , dated february 23rd .
asparagus for dinner again .
i hate asparagus .
does this mean i' il never grow up ?
nervous about meeting ' j ' tonight .
that' s the letter ' j ' , diane .
and that is the last entry .
that' s something to get started on .
yeah , that' s one out of 26 .
one out of 26 .
diane , i' ve just turned back 18 days to day one .
taped to the page is a plastic envelope containing a white residue and a key to a safety deposit box .
sheriff , we have to very carefully remove this key .
we' re going to run this envelope .
my bet is it will test positive for cocaine .
that' s impossible .
you ever been surprised before ?
mr cooper , you didn' t know laura palmer .
let' s get a court order to open the safety deposit box and maybe we' il both find out a fewthings about laura palmer .
diane , i' m holding a small box of chocolate bunnies .
lucy .
andy , is that you ?
tell harry we found where ... it happened .
where ronnette and laura were taken and tortured .
tell harry ...
... i didn' t cry .
andy , are you ok ?
sweetie ?
but , lucy ... ... it' s so horrible .
andy , sweetie .
my god .
bobby , you have been advised of your constitutional rights .
am i correct ?
yes .
bobby , did you kill laura palmer ?
no !
she was studying at your house until about 9 : 30 last night ?
yeah .
bobby .
yes , sir .
did she drive herself home ?
yes .
you two had a big fight last week , didn' t you ?
so what ?
if i had a fight with her , if i sang songs with her , if i went skipping rope with her , what difference does it make ?
i didn' t kill her .
bobby , here' s howthis works : we ask the questions and you answer the questions that we ask , briefly and to the point .
did you shoot this video , bobby ?
if you didn' t , then who did ?
did you know laura was seeing someone else ?
that' s what you fought about last week .
look at these pictures .
look how happy she is .
you ever do cocaine with laura , bobby ?
i don' t do drugs .
excuse me , what are you charging my client with ?
that' s right .
you' re a football player , aren' t you , bobby ?
if you knew who she was seeing ... ... tell us .
ask donna , she was with her .
i' m asking you .
come on , bobby , give me a name .
here' s a hint : first initial ' j ' .
no ... ... she wouldn' t do that to me .
you didn' t love her anyway .
let him go .
julie , the norwegians are signing the contract at four o' clock .
when mr horne returns , make sure they do not hear about laura palmer' s death .
that will blowthe whole deal .
got it ?
thank you .
ok , bob .
ok , bob .
julie , what would happen if i pulled this out ?
you wouldn' t .
audrey , look what you' ve done !
did they scoff the whole smorgasbord ?
audrey , don' t go in there .
i' m hungry .
don' t go in there !
excuse me , is there something wrong , young pretty girl ?
they found my friend laura ...
lying face down on a rocky beach , completely naked .
she' d been murdered .
hey , buddy .
snake .
we' re out of here , man .
just a sec .
donna' s still in there .
you straightened her out yet ?
i don' t know what' s up with her .
forget her .
i' ve got it figured .
laura and her .
that cop mentioned something about the letter ' j ' .
we' re looking at some freaking biker and some freaking biker is going to get his head busted open .
what' s his name ?
we' il finish this quick .
come outside .
robert , i' il be home this evening if you need a sympathetic ear .
i don' t need any damn sympathetic anything .
i have no idea what' s going on here .
let' s just go home .
so you were on a picnic , just the two of you ?
way up in the mountains , not another soui around ?
is there some law against having a picnic ?
donna , this is interesting to me .
with just two of you out there ,
i can' t figure out howthese pictures got taken .
that' s easy .
there was this ... hiker that came along , a woman hiker .
she had a backpack and ... ... we asked her to take the pictures for us .
what was her name ?
i don' t think we asked her .
i forgot .
donna , who are you protecting ?
nobody , that' s really what happened .
does this person' s name start with the letter ' j ' ?
she didn' t tell us her name .
donna , this is serious business .
more serious than laura falling in love with someone other than her boyfriend .
much more serious .
agent cooper , the sheriff' s ready to roll up to the site and i' ve got something else for you here .
you can come on in .
i know laura was your best friend .
you' ve been through a lot today .
we' re finished for now .
go ahead , lucy .
tell agent cooper what you heard .
after bobby was taken back to his cell , his parents were standing by the door with his lawyer .
bobby was released and he came out and saw his friend mike , who was down by the water cooler , which is near my desk .
i pretended to be typing , but i was typing what mike and bobby were saying .
they didn' t say exactly who it was they were talking about , but anyway here' s what they were saying .
they said the person we' re looking for is a biker .
looks like a hog to me .
holy smoke .
holy smoke !
the norwegians are leaving !
the norwegians are gone .
everyone here has gone .
not good .
you are throwing away the investment opportunity of a lifetime .
better that than throw a lifetime away .
you stay out of this !
sheriff .
diane , it' s 4 : 10 pm at the scene of the crime .
here' s something we haven' t seen before : a mound of dirt , a foot and a half in diameter .
on the top is a gold necklace with a gold heart .
correction : half a gold heart .
at the base of the mound of dirt is a torn piece of newsprint written with the words , which appear to be in blood ,
fire walk with me " .
sheriff , you and i have got to find out who' s got the other half of that heart .
mrs horne ?
it might help if you talked to johnny yourself .
so you think it might help ?
you can tell johnny one more time that laura isn' t coming this afternoon to work with him .
or tomorrow afternoon or any afternoon .
what is so difficult to understand about that ?
it fell down .
i knew laura .
she was always so nice .
when was the last time she came in ?
i couldn' t tell you exactly .
we have so many box es .
you don' t keep records ?
we have plenty of paperwork .
how long has she had this box ?
i' d say about six months .
i could check for you .
would you , please ?
and close the door on the way out .
flesh world " .
man !
there' s over 10, 000 dollars here .
that' s a lot of girl scout cookies .
here' s a page that' s marked .
ronnette pulaski .
i can' t believe it .
... the law enforcement officials emerging from an abandoned railway car ...
shelly , would you turn the television off ?
why , leo ?
i want to see this .
shelly , turn it off . ... escaped her captor and fled to safety , remains hospitalised in critical condition ...
shelly , sit down here a minute and help me out .
what kind of cigarettes do you smoke ?
whatever' s around .
no , you don' t .
you smoke these .
what are these doing here ?
i pick up different packs from the diner all the time , me and norma .
two things , shelly .
when i come home , this house should be clean and i mean clean .
you smoke one brand of cigarettes from now on .
if i ever see two brands of cigarettes again ,
i' m going to snap your neck like a twig .
you have nothing to worry about with me , darling .
that' s right .
big ed' s gas farm .
ed speaking .
i' m sorry .
i know i promised not to call you there , but i have to see you .
i hurt so bad .
it' s ok .
why don' t i meet you at the roadhouse around 9 : 30 ?
thank you , ed .
i' il see you tonight .
all right , sweetheart .
i think i saw a cottontail rabbit .
must have been a snowshoe rabbit .
snowshoe ?
snowshoe rabbit ?
who' s the babe ?
that is one of the most beautiful women in the state .
mrs packard .
packard sawmill ?
where' s mr packard ?
died in a boating accident .
andrew packard practically built this town .
brought her over from hong kong .
left her everything , which didn' t exactly please his sister .
that' s her , the original deep freeze .
who' s the glad handing dandy ?
benjamin horne , local big wig .
he owns half the town .
he' s not after her .
he' s after her land .
who' s the lady with the log ?
we call her the log lady .
ladies and gentlemen , if i could have your attention .
is this thing on ?
is this thing on ?
hang on , dwayne .
thank you , mayor milford .
agent cooper .
thank you , sheriff .
ladies and gentlemen , fbi special agent dale cooper .
one year ago , in a town in the south west corner of this state , the body of a young girl named teresa banks was found .
she had no family .
no one came forward to claim her body .
it wasn' t even news ... until today .
there are irrefutable similarities , which i cannot discuss , that lead us to conclude laura palmer was the second and ronnette pulaski would have been the third victim of the same killer .
there is a chance the person who committed these crimes is someone from this town , possibly even someone you know .
it is vitally important that this not turn into a witch hunt .
i would suggest a temporary curfew for those under eighteen years of age .
keeping your kids off the streets now may teach them caution that may protect them in the days and weeks to come .
i will remind you that these crimes occurred at night .
when i left the house , sarah was sleeping .
leland made it through the day somehow .
i' m not sure i could have done the same .
poor dear , poor sarah .
eileen , the brutality ... the madness of it .
i know .
they' re not releasing many details .
wisely , i suppose .
at the scene where it happened , no one else knows this , they found part of a necklace , half of a golden heart .
it was laura' s .
they know this because she was wearing it in a video of a picnic they found .
i' m telling you this because donna was in the video with her .
she won' t tell them who shot it or who else was with them , but they think the killer may have the other half of the heart .
donna , which do you like better ?
the blossom of the evening " or " the full flower of the evening " ?
listen to me , this is serious .
this is serious , too .
i' m going out the window and i need you to cover for me .
don' t you know there' s a curfew ?
they announced it on the radio .
i know , einstein .
that' s why i need you to cover for me .
i suppose this will include a phone conversation with mike ,
mr bonehead boyfriend ?
no , this is about laura and it' s really serious .
check .
thank you .
i' il need to borrow your bike .
then , pump some air in the back tyre .
yeah .
harriet , don' t forget to brush your teeth .
actually , now that some time has passed ,
i like " the full blossom of the evening " .
hey , snake .
don' t take any oink oink off that pretty pig .
don' t you worry about that .
hi , doctor hayward .
i' d like to talk to donna .
donna' s upstairs getting ready for bed , mike .
you' re not drinking and driving , are you ?
we' re all pretty broken up about what happened today , sir .
besides , bobby' s doing most of the driving .
i' il see if she wants to come down .
would you mind waiting out here , please ?
the best laid plans of mice and men .
snake , let' s go !
where' s your sister ?
dad , i' m going to tell it to you and i' m going to tell it to you straight .
harriet !
see that window ?
later .
donna' s not here .
you mean she snuck out ?
mike , maybe you have an idea where she might have gone .
oh , we' il find her .
don' t you worry about that .
roadhouse .
let' s go !
sheriff , i' ve got a call for you from dr hayward .
i explained that you' re on a stake out at the roadhouse , but he still would very much like to talk to you .
patch him through .
i' m going to patch him through to you now , sheriff .
i' m patching you through now , dr hayward .
harry , my daughter donna snuck out of the house .
i don' t know where she' s gone .
doc , you rest easy now .
i' m going to put out an all points for her .
we' il keep our eyes peeled .
thanks , harry .
you betcha .
lucy , you take care of that all points now .
all right , sheriff .
of course donna snuck out .
meaning what ?
how else is she going to lead us to that biker ?
so all afternoon i' ve been hanging drapes .
drapes ?
drapes .
lots of them .
you know how i feel about you , ed .
don' t do it for me , do it for yourself .
it' s tammy wynette time , darling .
yeah ?
what about you and hank ?
i told you .
i' m going to leave hank .
before or after he gets parole ?
i love you , ed .
i' il do what' s best for both of us .
when your sweetheart' s husband' s in the joint for manslaughter , the word " parole " has a nasty ring to it .
you know why i' m whittling ?
ok , i' il bite again .
why are you whittling ?
that' s what you do in a town where a yellow light still means slow down , not speed up .
mike and bobby .
there' s liable to be a little trouble this evening .
scottie , mutt and jeff just crawled in .
oh , what a wonderful world !
looks like sooner than later .
why don' t you whistle for a little backup ?
i see which way the wind' s blowing .
lucy , get us a backup unit at the roadhouse right away .
make that two .
and call dr hayward .
tell him we' ve found his daughter and she' s fine .
all right , sheriff .
donna !
why are you sneaking around ?
everybody' s looking for you .
get your hands off me .
leave me alone !
get your hands off me !
get your hands off me .
let go of me .
no !
that' s enough !
you heard him .
let me go !
like that , mr monkey wrench ?
you guys got it covered ?
don' t worry , i' il take you to james .
joey paulsen .
that' s a ' j ' .
no , he' s taking her to somebody else .
you want me to follow them at a discreet distance ?
harry , you' re all right .
hold on !
do you think they spotted us ?
give me a doughnut .
well , harry , i think we lost them .
man , smell those trees !
smell those douglas firs .
i think i hear them .
what' s down there ?
an old logging road .
the only access is five miles back at the packard mill .
i told doc hayward his daughter was ok .
my fault , harry .
thanks , joe .
good luck , james .
james , they' re looking for you .
i' m going to talk to them , but i think they' re going to lock me up .
why ?
i don' t have an alibi for last night .
i was with her .
james , what happened last night ?
it was kinda like a nightmare .
donna , she was a different person .
what are you saying ?
i' m telling you , there were things she was involved with , things she let herself get pulled into , things she thought you' d hate her for .
she said , " there are things about me ...
she said , " even donna doesn' t know me .
i knew her .
i knew her better than she thought i did .
donna , she said something about a guy getting killed .
who ?
she didn' t say .
but she said bobby told her that he killed this guy .
oh , my god .
this is why i had to see you .
it all makes some kind of terrible sense that she died , that someone killed her .
i don' t know .
i can' t explain it .
i didn' t know whether to believe any of this last night .
i mean , half the time she wasn' t making any sense .
i couldn' t calm her down .
i could hardly keep her on the bike .
we came to the light at sparkwood and 21 , and she ... she put her hands around my neck and she screamed she loved me .
i looked into her eyes .
they were clear .
it was like she was laura again .
she was so sad .
she sounded so desperate .
then she ran off .
i let her go and she died .
it' s ok .
it' s not your fault , james .
it' s ok .
james .
it' s all right , james .
oh , my god .
i' m sorry .
oh , my god .
i changed my mind .
i' m not sorry .
james .
james .
oh , james .
those are sirens .
i' ve got to go to the police .
i don' t have an alibi .
after she left i just rode around .
the necklace you gave laura with the golden heart .
you have to give me the other half .
why ?
they found the half where she was killed and think the killer has the other half .
if you go there with the necklace and no alibi ...
what about you ?
i' il get rid of it .
no .
we' il hide it .
all right .
we' il bury it .
ok .
right here .
ok .
i' il take you home .
what goes around comes around .
round and round .
that' s not joey , that' s james hurley .
james , stand away from the bike .
stand away from the girl .
put your hands behind your head .
he didn' t do anything !
she' s probably right .
james .
he didn' t do anything .
lucy , get an arrest form ready .
doc , i' m releasing her to you , but i want her back for questioning in the morning .
all right , harry .
andy , hawk .
put james back in number four .
james .
it' s gonna be all right .
you !
we' il check on you later .
good night , officers .
i' m sorry , dad .
donna , after what happened today ,
i' m sure you understand what you put your mother and me through tonight .
but i know you wouldn' t have done it unless you had a good reason .
we also have another problem facing us , young lady .
where' s your sister' s bicycle ?
i left it at the roadhouse .
we' il have to go get it .
i understand you promised harriet you' d put some air in the back tyre .
yes , i did .
we' re so thankful to have a daughter like you .
a policeman' s dream !
yup , lucy sets it up for us every night .
is everything ok ?
there' s extra jelly doughnuts for agent cooper and there' s some extra decaf .
you know , andy' s been drinking so much caffeinated coffee lately .
thank you , lucy .
you can go back to work now and no listening .
sheriff , that reminds me .
can you recommend a good , inexpensive hotel or motel ?
it doesn' t have to be fancy .
i can get you a good rate up at the great northern .
i think i' m going to be here for some time .
these motels promise you a good rate , but when you get there it' s a different story .
all i need is a bed , a bathroom , a telephone , and sometimes a television , in the event i get a chance to knock off early .
i can get you a good rate up at the great northern .
sold .
well , tomorrow comes early .
diane , it' s 12 : 28 am .
i' il be staying locally at the great northern hotel .
sheriff' s getting me a rate .
when you least expect it .
hello , sheriff .
hey , jo .
i understand you wanted to see the sheriff up here .
yes , i did .
right over here .
he' s here again .
let' s get together and talk about it .
all right .
all right .
it must have happened about this time 24 hours ago .
i' m afraid .
