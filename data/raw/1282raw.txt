<i>there are so many show offs in journalism . </ i>
<i>so many braggarts and jerks . </ i>
<i>they are always selling , always working the room, </ i> <i>always trying to make themselves look hotter than they actually are . </ i>
<i>the good news is, </ i> <i>reporters like that make it easy to distinguish yourself . </ i>
<i>if you' re even a little bit humble, </ i> <i>a little self effacing or solicitous , you stand out . </ i>
<i>so you bring a co worker lunch if he' s buried under a deadline, </ i> <i>you remember birthdays . </ i>
<i>it' s true , journalism is hard work, </ i> <i>everybody' s under pressure , everybody' s grinding to get the issue out . </ i>
<i>nobody' s getting any sleep , but you are allowed to smile every once in a while . </ i>
<i>i mean , even woodward and bernstein went out for a burger now and then, </ i> <i>and they won a pulitzer . </ i>
<i>some reporters think it' s political content</ i> <i>that makes a story memorable . </ i>
<i>i think it' s the people you find ... </ i> <i>their quirks , their flaws, </ i> <i>what makes them funny , what makes them human . </ i>
<i>journalism is just the art of capturing behavior . </ i>
<i>you have to know who you' re writing for . </ i>
<i>and you have to know what you' re good at . </ i>
<i>i record what people do, </ i>
<i>i find out what moves them , what scares them, </ i> <i>and i write that down . </ i>
<i>that way , they are the ones telling the story . </ i>
<i>you know what ?
those kind of pieces can win pulitzers too . </ i>

<i>people want photographs , they can buy newsweek . </ i>

<i>let me guess .
he' s on you again about a redesign . </ i>
<i> yeah , cover page and graphics .
and photographs . </ i>
<i>let me remind you steve, </ i> this magazine hasn' t changed its look since the ' 80s .
how is it ?
it' s good .
<i> you hate it .
no , it' s good , it' s a little rough . </ i>
<i>no , it' s the worst thing i ever wrote .
it' s horrible . </ i>
if you guys don' t help me with it , i' m not even going to send it in .
<i> when is it due ?
tomorrow . </ i>
tsk ...
i may have to kill myself .
<i>i mean , the new york times magazine ! </ i>
will you guys help me with it , please ?
<i> of course .
of course . </ i>
thank you .
<i>call for you on three , sweetie ... someone from policy review . </ i>
<i>when did you start talking to policy review ? </ i>
<i>i' m not .

<i>the lawyers have asked us to tone down the cover on serbia . </ i>
<i> they have ?
it might invite charges of libel . </ i>
i know a little bit of libel law , <i>it' s only relevant if the person in question has been out of the public eye . </ i>
<i>well , yes .
so there is serbia , hidden, </ i> <i>unknown to the world at large , until ... </ i> <i>it appeared on the cover of the new republic . </ i>
<i>our weekly circulation of 80, 000 . </ i>
81 . 5 .

<i>and that' s the thrill of working at the new republic . </ i>
<i>you' re underpaid , the hours are brutal, </ i> <i>but what you write gets read by people who matter . </ i>
<i>presidents , lawmakers ... your work can actually influence public policy . </ i>
<i>that' s ... that' s an amazing privilege, </ i> <i>and a huge responsibility . </ i>
<i>i' m sorry .
they don' t want to hear</ i> <i>the whole " journalistic responsibility " speech ... do you ? </ i>
<i>you just want to know how to get your name in print , right ? </ i>
<i>that sounds familiar .
okay . </ i>
<i>let me take you through the life of your typical piece</ i> <i>so you can see what some of the hurdles are . </ i>
<i>we' il use one i wrote last year, </ i> <i>about a bunch of young republicans at a conservatives ' convention . </ i>
<i>now , journalism is about pursuing the truth . </ i>
<i>and i would never encourage you to do anything sneaky or dishonest</ i> <i>in pursuit of a story , such as assuming a phony identity . </ i>
<i>i don' t know , man .
it seemed like a pretty good turnout to me . </ i>
<i>no , man .
conservatism is dead . </ i>
<i> dead ?
we' re lost . </ i>
<i>damn straight . </ i>
<i>on a story like that , your notes are crucial . </ i>
<i>you have to record everything you see and hear . </ i>
<i>every quote , every detail ... </ i> <i>all the way down to the mini bottles in the fridge . </ i>
<i>we' re like this guy who has to pee, </ i>
<i>lost in the desert , looking for a tree . </ i>
<i>that' s true .
completely true . </ i>
<i>you guys know what you' re shopping for , right ? </ i>
yeah , totally .
<i>get us a real " heifer .
the fatter the better . </ i>
bad acne would be a bonus .
<i>let' s do it ! </ i>
hey , steve .
hey , chuck .
<i>what are you working on ? </ i>
<i>a piece gabriel garca marquez wrote about the falklands war . </ i>
<i>how about you ? </ i>
<i>young republicans at a cpac conference . </ i>
<i>pretty standard stuff . </ i>
<i>hotel ballrooms , boring speeches .
chicken dinners . </ i>
<i>which is why everybody spends their time in the suites upstairs</ i> committing felonies .
oh , yeah ?
<i>yeah .
i went to one .
the ballroom was empty . </ i>
<i>every delegate under the age of 25 was on the fifth floor getting loaded . </ i>
<i>drugs , binge drinking , hookers ... </ i> <i>it gets pretty ugly . </ i>
<i> sounds great , steve .
so does yours . </ i>
<i>okay , well , i gotta get back to work .
have a good lunch . </ i>
thanks .
<i>hold it .
have to give myself a demerit for poor scene setting . </ i>
<i>let me explain .
a year ago , chuck lane and i were peers . </ i>
<i>he hadn' t become editor yet . </ i>
michael kelly was editing the magazine then .
<i>sorry , mrs. duke .
i know how you feel about clarity . </ i>
<i>we' ve got to start calling some other places . </ i>
<i>i don' t think i can eat this stuff every day . </ i>
it was the cannon building .
you had it as " russell .
i fixed it .
<i> thank you .
i really liked it , ames . </ i>
<i>but boring , right ? </ i>
<i>no .
no .
i really , really liked it . </ i>
<i> ahem ...
yes , dear ? </ i>
<i>somebody for you on three ... someone from harper' s . </ i>
<i>when did you start talking to harper' s ? </ i>
<i>i' m not .
it' s probably nothing .
could you send it to my voicemail ? </ i>
<i> very good .
by the way , glo ' , </ i> that lipstick is the bomb .
thanks , doll .
was it " midnight mist " ?
<i> i' ve really got to stop doing that .
what ? </ i>
<i>all i do is give people more reasons to assume i' m gay . </ i>
<i>i mean , lately , it' s everyone . </ i>
<i>the other night , i went out to dinner with this guy from the post ... </ i>
<i> who ?
i can' t tell you , he made me promise . </ i>
<i>anyway , we' re walking afterwards , talking about medicare for god' s sakes, </ i> <i>the next thing i know is we' re standing on the corner of 18th and " t " ... </ i> <i>and he somehow managed to slip his tongue down my throat . </ i>
and i' m like , " wait a minute , how' d this happen ?
<i>i don' t understand .
neither did i. </ i>
hey !
michael .
<i> do you have a minute ?
of course . </ i>
<i>we have a problem with the " spring breakdown " piece . </ i>
<i>just got a letter from david keene .
he ran the cpac conference . </ i>
<i> he' s made ...
are you mad at me ? </ i>
<i>he' s made some pretty serious charges .
we need to answer them . </ i>
<i>okay .
my notes are at home . </ i>
i can be back in 20 minutes .
is that too long ?
<i>do your notes have anything about the minibars ?
that would help . </ i>
<i>i think so .
no , i' m sure .
why ? </ i>
<i>he claims the omni shoreham doesn' t even have minibars . </ i>
he mentioned it specifically .
no , i saw them .
<i>there were little bottles of booze all over the room . </ i>
<i>okay .
i' il get aaron and rob into it, </ i> <i>and start the fact check again . </ i>
i' il get my notes .
thank you .
<i>i' m sorry , we' re gonna have to finish this later . </ i>
<i>no , no .
i understand .
thank you . </ i>
<i>what' s wrong ? </ i>
just tell me .
<i>keene was right , michael . </ i>
i messed up .
<i>i made a huge error . </ i>
<i>i don' t know what to say .
if you want me to resign , i will . </ i>
i want you to tell me what happened .
<i>they don' t have minibars at the omni shoreham hotel . </ i>
i guess i just saw all those little bottles and i made an assumption , <i>which i know we' re never supposed to do . </ i>
<i>i' m really sorry . </ i>
<i>those guys were drinking out of a rented refrigerator . </ i>
<i>a mini fridge . </ i>
that' s it ?
yeah .
<i> the rest of the piece is solid ?
well , yeah , of course . </ i>
<i>go home , steve .
your resignation will not be required . </ i>
<i> really ?
you' re not mad ?
of course not . </ i>
do you want my notes ?
have a good night .
thanks , michael .
<i>thanks for backing me . </ i>
<i>it' s what editors do . </ i>
<i>good night . </ i>
<i>hi , front desk , please ? </ i>
<i>hi , i need some information . </ i>
<i>do the suites of your hotel have minibars ? </ i>
<i>well , can a guest rent something like that ... </ i>
<i>like a mini refrigerator or something ? </ i>
<i>they can ?
okay , thank you very much . </ i>
<i>and she says , " i didn' t invite vernon jordan that evening, </ i> <i>because my guests of honor were girls from smith college . </ i>
<i>some of them were virgins , and i wanted to keep it that way . " </ i>
<i>and you are going to put that in the article , right ? </ i>
gosh , alec , i don' t know .
<i>i mean , george is such a dignified publication . </ i>
you wouldn' t want to put in something that gossipy , would you ?
no , absolutely not .
<i>of course i' m putting it in . </ i>
<i>thank you steve .
you are going to make me look very , very smart . </ i>
<i>er , the fritos are running dangerously low . </ i>
<i>i' il be right back . </ i>
<i>can' t hide in here all night , ames . </ i>
can i ask you something ?
what is this ?
<i>i found it in the freezer . </ i>
<i>you said you hated how the diet coke at parties</ i> <i>was always at room temperature .
and if you wanted to drink it cold, </ i> <i>you' d have to put it on ice and it would get too watery .
don' t you remember ? </ i>
yeah , i do , but ...
<i>i said that a couple of years ago . </ i>
<i>steve ? </ i>
<i>i' m going to call it a night , but thanks for having me . </ i>
<i>thanks for coming . </ i>
<i>alphabetized beer , that' s perfect . </ i>
<i> drive safe , alec .
who' s he ? </ i>
<i>associate editor of george . </ i>
<i>when did you start talking to george ? </ i>
<i>i' m really not . </ i>
<i>it' s probably nothing . </ i>
<i>you know , if they stoop any lower, </ i> <i>you won' t be able to tell the difference between time and people . </ i>
<i>you say that as if there is a difference between time and people . </ i>
exactly .
hey !
thank you , steve .
what ?
<i>are you mad at me ? </ i>
<i>i told you , i do not respond to " are you mad at me ? " </ i>
<i>i' m not your kindergarten teacher . </ i>
<i>i thought we' d been over this a thousand times already . </ i>
you can' t go to law school .
<i>you " don' t want to go to law school , " remember ? </ i>
<i>i know .
it' s only nights .
i wouldn' t have to stop working . </ i>
<i>i' m going to put these down .
i' il be right back . </ i>
no , i want to talk about this .
<i>i told you , it' s my parents .
okay ? </ i>
<i>they never shut up about it . </ i>
<i>if i don' t go , they won' t let me be a journalist anymore . </ i>
<i>" let you " ?
you' re 24 years old , stephen ! </ i>
<i>you don' t know how things go where i grew up , caitlin . </ i>
<i>there are rules there . </ i>
<i>if your son' s not a doctor or a lawyer , you keep your curtains closed . </ i>
<i>you' re writing for the new fucking republic . </ i>
isn' t that good enough ?
<i>not in highland park . </ i>
<i> i' m sorry , i ...
stop apologizing for everything ! </ i>
<i>i was looking through your mail .
you should be pissed at me . </ i>
i' m not .
<i>you' re going to throw this out , right ? </ i>
<i>i can' t .
i' m sorry . </ i>
<i>every station on the radio was talking about it ... </ i>
<i>mike tyson biting evander holyfield . </ i>
<i>and these are supposed to be news stations, </ i> <i>so on tuesday i started calling a few of them, </ i> <i>and i finally got through to one . </ i>
a bible talk station in kentucky .
<i>and i managed to convince the screener</ i> <i>that i was a behavioral psychologist</ i> who " specializes in human on human biting .
<i>i told the guy that i' d done all this extensive research</ i> <i>on people who chomp flesh under extreme stress ... </ i>
and what did they say ?
<i>they put me on the air , i took calls for 45 minutes . </ i>
oh , my god !
<i>where does he find these people ? </ i>
it' s kind of stupid , i know .
it' s silly .
<i>i' il probably just kill it . </ i>
does that mean you' il help me with it ?
why ?
do you have finals this week ?
<i>okay , moving right along . </ i>
<i>chuck , what do you have for us ? </ i>
<i>that' s a bit of a hard act to follow . </ i>
<i>very hard act to follow . </ i>
okay .
<i>i' m starting the piece on haiti, </ i> and i' il be going to ...
<i>hey .
don' t let me interrupt . </ i>
<i> hey , marty .
michael . </ i>
<i>i' m going to be going to port au prince for a few days . </ i>
uh huh .
<i>marty peretz , our boss , he' s a little scary . </ i>
<i>how about the commas and dates ?
are we supposed to circle those too ? </ i>
let' s just get this done , okay ?
what the hell is this ?
<i>marty told us to circle all the commas in the last issue, </ i> <i>so he could show us how we used them improperly . </ i>
what ?
<i>he said , " commas should always appear in pairs . " </ i>
<i>apparently the issue was rife with comma errors . </ i>
" rife " ?
that' s what he said .
i see .
<i>no , i' m not angry , marty .
i' m embarrassed for you . </ i>
<i>these people work grueling hours for meager pay . </ i>
<i>they deserve a thank you, </ i> <i>not another one of your world famous tantrums . </ i>
<i>yeah , okay .
i' d resign before i' d let you bully them like that again . </ i>
<i>and i will .
do you understand that ? </ i>
<i>okay .
thank you . </ i>
<i>" the great comma debate " is history, </ i> <i>so we can all go back to work . </ i>
<i>there are good editors , there are bad editors . </ i>
you' il have both .
<i>my hope for you though is that once, </ i> <i>at least once you get a truly great one . </ i>
<i>a great editor defends his writers ... </ i> <i>against anyone .
he stands up , and fights for you . </ i>
<i>michael kelly was that kind of editor . </ i>
<i>he had that kind of courage . </ i>
and that' s what hung him .
hello .
<i>hey , chuck , it' s marty peretz .
you got a minute ? </ i>
<i>of course , how are you , marty ? </ i>
<i>i' m in a bit of an uncomfortable situation . </ i>
<i>i thought you might be able to help me out . </ i>
<i> sure .
it' s about mike . </ i>
<i> oh .
he and i ... </ i> <i>well , it hasn' t been working out for some time now , as you know . </ i>
<i>the tone of the magazine i think it' s ... gotten too nasty ! </ i>
<i>it' s strayed from the traditions that make it great . </ i>
<i>and ...
i' m going to be making a change . </ i>
i see .
<i>i' d like you to step in for him , chuck .
i' d like you to become editor . </ i>
<i>editor ? </ i>
<i>there' s a catch , of course .
mike doesn' t know any of this yet, </ i> <i>and it' s gonna be two or three days before i tell him . </ i>
<i>it' il have to remain between us until then .
would that be a problem ? </ i>
<i> marty , mike' s a friend .
i appreciate that , chuck . </ i>
<i>but i can' t remove him until i know who is going to be his replacement</ i> <i>for continuity' s sake .
so this is how it has to be . </ i>
i' m gonna have to think about this .
<i>i' m gonna have to discuss it with caterina . </ i>
<i>of course , of course !
listen ... </ i>
<i>marty , have you thought about the impact this might have on the staff ? </ i>
<i>they feel very ... </ i> <i>he' s earned a lot of loyalty there . </ i>
<i>yes , mostly by fighting with me . </ i>
<i>the point is , i haven' t earned that kind of loyalty .
if it looks like ... </ i>
<i>i' il be there tomorrow .
we' il go over all this in detail . </ i>
<i> will you call me at the hotel ?
yeah . </ i>
<i>i really appreciate this , chuck ... your discretion . </ i>
<i> good night .
' night , marty . </ i>
<i>so , i just got off the phone with marty, </ i> <i>and i' ve been fired , effective immediately . </ i>
<i>i' m to be out of the building by 5 : 00 p . m . </ i>
<i>chuck lane has been chosen to replace me . </ i>
<i>chuck is not an editor . </ i>
<i>he' s barely even a writer . </ i>
<i>there' s no way i' m gonna be able to work for him . </ i>
<i>we should' ve seen this coming ... </ i> <i>the way he laughs whenever marty tells a joke in the meetings . </ i>
<i>they' re never funny , but there' s chuck completely howling .
he' s so political . </ i>
<i>and stiff , and humorless . </ i>
and pissy .
i mean , how pissy does he get <i>whenever you try to fact check one of his pieces ? </ i>
<i>it' s like i' m sorry , but we have an obligation to get our facts straight . </ i>
<i>okay , let' s not overdo it . </ i>
<i>this is still a great magazine , it' s still an important magazine . </ i>
<i>and ...
monday morning he' s going to be running it . </ i>
<i>i' m going to barf . </ i>
<i>all right .
let me get out of here , okay ? </ i>
<i>well , i just want to thank you all again .
truly . </ i>
<i>i' ve loved every second of this . </ i>
good luck , mike .
you too , chuck .
hi .
hi .
hi .
so ... <i>sorry about what happened when he left . </ i>
i just didn' t know what to do .
thanks .
if you need a hand with the boxes , i' il be in my office .
<i>so chuck took over, </ i> <i>and the job , for the first time ever, </ i> <i>began to feel like a job . </ i>
<i>but i' m being unfair . </ i>
<i>the truth is , i wrote 14 pieces while chuck was editing the magazine . </ i>
<i>and the last of them, </ i> <i>was the biggest story i ever wrote . </ i>
<i>is anyone interested in hackers ? </ i>
because i met this kid named ian restil .
<i>biggest computer geek of all time . </ i>
<i>he hacked his way into the database of a company called jukt micronics, </ i> <i>and posted naked pictures of women</ i> <i>and the salary of every jukt employee on jukt' s website with a note</ i> <i>saying , " the big bad bionic boy has been here , baby ! " </ i>
outstanding .
<i>the guys at jukt decided that it would be cheaper to hire him</ i> <i>as security consultant than it would be to try to stop him, </ i> so they met with him last week at the hotel <i>where the national hackers ' conference was taking place . </ i>
<i>it was the chairman from jukt, </ i>
<i>restil , restil' s mother and restil' s agent . </ i>
no ... !
<i>yes , hackers have agents too . </ i>
<i>all right , i was at the table with these guys . </ i>
<i>restil' s just laying out all of his demands . </ i>
<i> i want a miata ...
" i want a trip to disney world . " </ i>
i want " x men " comic book no .
1 . <i> " ... a lifetime subscription to playboy .
and throw in penthouse . </ i>
<i>and they' re complying with every single word . </ i>
<i>excuse me sir , pardon me for interrupting . </ i>
<i>we can arrange more money and you can buy the comic yourself . </ i>
<i>and when you' re of a more appropriate age, </ i> <i>you can buy the car</ i> <i>and pornographic magazines on your own . </ i>
cool .
<i>after that , after they have the meeting, </ i> <i>he goes back into the conference , where all these hackers have gathered, </ i> <i>and they' re treating him like he' s a rock star . </ i>
<i>then , restil jumps up on a table , and he' s like ... </ i>
i want a miata !
<i>and he' s gyrating his hips like this .
i want a miata ! </ i>
<i>i want my playboys !
i want a trip to disney world ! " </ i>
show me the money !
show me the money !
<i>turns out there are now 21 states</ i> <i>considering versions of a law</ i> <i>called the " uniform computer security act , " </ i> <i>which would criminalize immunity deals</ i> <i>between hackers and the companies they' ve torched . </ i>
<i>meanwhile , restil' s agent claims a client list of over 300, </ i> <i>one of whom was once paid a million dollars ... </ i> <i>and a monster truck . </ i>
that' s unbelievable .
<i>it' s really silly , i know . </ i>
<i>i' m not even sure if i' m going to finish it . </ i>
shit .
<i>you rang ? </ i>
<i>yes , i rang . </ i>
why didn' t you get this ?
yeah .
oh , that ...
i don' t know .
hey .
hey .
<i>is it pronounced " jooked " or " jucked " ? </ i>
<i>it' s pronounced , " give me back my article . " </ i>
adam ... !
can you give a man a minute ?
<i>oh , yeah .
i' m sorry . </ i>
<i>er , it' s just that ... </ i> <i>this new republic piece is a fucking sieve . </ i>
<i>i started with a check on " jukt micronics , " </ i> <i>which is supposed to be this major software company in california . </ i>
<i>i went through every search engine on the web ... no matches found . </ i>
<i>so i called 411 every area code in the state . </ i>
<i>there' s no listing anywhere for a company called " jukt micronics . " </ i>
<i>tried the california tax franchise board, </ i> <i>there' s no record of taxes ever having been paid</ i> <i>by a company called jukt micronics . </ i>
<i>tried the state comptroller' s office, </ i> <i>no license has ever been applied for by a company using that name . </ i>
<i>then i called all the hackers i know, </ i> <i>asking if any had heard of a " national assembly of hackers , " </ i> <i>or a hacker by the name of " big bad bionic boy . " </ i>
<i>nothing .
i even tried ian restil himself . </ i>
<i>there' s no listing for the kid in d. c. , virginia , maryland . </ i>
<i>there' s no record of him ever having attended a public school before . </ i>
<i> more ?
please . </ i>
<i>this guy joe hiert was described in the glass piece</ i> <i>as being this a former basketball agent, </ i> <i>yet no one by that name has ever been registered with the nba</ i> <i>and none of my hackers knew of him . </ i>
<i>i even checked the names of every government ... </ i>
i was just getting some coffee .
<i>i checked the names of every government employee quoted in the piece, </ i> <i>against a book listing the names of every government employee</ i> <i>in the entire united states .
none of the glass sources were listed . </ i>
<i>but there is one thing in this story that checks out . </ i>
what' s that ?
<i>there does appear to be a state in the union named nevada . </ i>
david .
<i> for christ' s sakes .
god , i' m sorry , stephen . </ i>
<i>i wanted to see if you read it yet .
it was sitting right here , you know ? </ i>
don' t hate me , okay ?
<i>stephen , you shredded it . </ i>
<i>i' m trying to spare you a spanking , david . </ i>
<i>you' ve got blind quotes all over the place . </ i>
<i>your facts are shaky .

<i>rob and aaron would kill you over that kind of stuff . </ i>
<i>this is the new republic , remember ? </ i>

thanks , stephen .
<i>" you have one unheard message .
first message . " </ i>
<i>hi , stephen , this is adam penenberg , from forbes digital tool . </ i>
<i>i just got done reading your hacker article . </ i>
<i>first of all , congratulations . </ i>
<i>i mean , everybody here just loved it . </ i>
<i>but we wanted to do a companion piece to it, </ i> <i>sort of a " day two " story ... </ i> <i>and i' m having some trouble tracking down ian restil . </ i>
<i>do you think i could get a phone number on him from you ? </ i>
<i>look , i think it' s good that you tried this . </ i>
<i>it' s good to stretch .
i just ... </ i>
<i>i don' t think you' re writing to your strengths here . </ i>
i mean ...
can i ?
<i>i' m wondering why you' d want to stray from the things you do so well ? </ i>
have you noticed the way
<i>steve' s phone has been ringing lately ? </ i>
<i>did you see all those editors at the correspondents ' dinner ? </ i>
<i> the way they were circling him ?
is that what you want , amy ? </ i>
<i>to get a bunch of smoke blown up your ass by a pack of editors ? </ i>
yes .
yes , it is .
<i>caitlin , he' s going to double his salary</ i> <i>freelancing like that . </ i>
<i>these guys don' t want policy pieces anymore . </ i>
<i>they want color , they want nuance , humor . </ i>
<i>but amy , you don' t write funny . </ i>
it' s a little funny ... isn' t it ?
<i> i was just looking for steve .
he' s in his office . </ i>
you got a minute , steve ?
yeah .
<i>do you have phone numbers for sources on the " hack heaven " piece ? </ i>
<i> mm hm , but they' re at home .
can i get them ? </ i>
<i>of course .
did i do something wrong ?
are you mad at me ? </ i>
<i>no , i just need the phone numbers . </ i>
okay .
<i>okay .
okay , i' m trying to keep cool about all this , but ... </ i> <i>you know the " uniform computer security act , " in the glass piece ? </ i>
<i>supposed to be under debate in 21 state legislatures ? </ i>
i just checked off 50 ... no such act .
beautiful .
<i>and julie farthwork , from the " computer security center " ? </ i>
<i>not too sure she exists either . </ i>
<i>same with jim ghort of the " center for interstate online investigations . " </ i>
<i>and i' ve got nothing</ i> <i>on the " national assembly of hackers , " or " frank juliet . " </ i>
man !
<i>do you know why this is so great ?
i mean , do you see the irony here ? </ i>
<i>the new republic , snobbiest rag in the business ... </ i>
<i>" the in flight magazine of air force one " ... </ i> <i>and their star goes out and gets completely snowed by a bunch of hackers . </ i>
<i>i mean , god couldn' t have written this any better . </ i>
<i> adam ?
yeah ? </ i>
<i>as long as i' m grinding away on this thing, </ i> <i>any chance you' d share your byline with me ? </ i>
<i>forget it . </ i>
<i>we' re in uncharted territory here , adam ... </ i> <i>an online magazine going after a giant . </ i>
you should have somebody beside you to take some of the flak in case this thing blows up .
<i> gosh , that' s touching .
you' re completely swamped . </ i>
<i>you' re behind on the kim polese piece .
i know it' s due friday . </ i>
i' il get to it .
<i>everything that i' m working on is so ... dull, </ i> <i>and this is spectacular . </ i>
andy ... no .
<i>it' s not like you found the story yourself .
kambiz handed it to you . </ i>
<i>if i hadn' t been at the dentist , it might be me about to get famous . </ i>
<i>so why don' t you just ... share the wealth , okay ?
shit ! </ i>
<i>that came out a lot uglier than i meant it .
sorry . </ i>
<i> hey .
hey . </ i>
<i>well , ian restil e mailed me right back . </ i>
<i>it might be tough to put you in touch with him directly , though, </ i> <i>or at least until next week .
this is his e mail : </ i>
<i>" your story screwed up my deal , i don' t to talk to y ... " </ i>
i think he meant ...
" i don' t want to talk to you .
<i>yeah .
i' m on vacation with my parents , so leave me alone . " </ i>
<i>what kind of parent goes on vacation with their kid in early may ? </ i>
that' s a good question .
<i>i guess you have to know his mom .
she' s a little quirky . </ i>
<i>that' s his e mail address , if you want to write him yourself . </ i>
<i>these are all my notes . </ i>
<i>that' s the number for the national assembly of hackers . </ i>
<i>don' t be thrown if all you hear is a dark , deep , heavy breathing . </ i>
<i>it' s ...
i don' t know , their outgoing voicemail message . </ i>
don' t ask me why .
<i>and then that' s the number for jukt micronics . </ i>
<i>the chairman' s name is george sims . </ i>
<i>i can' t figure why this penenberg guy would have such hard time finding it, </ i> <i>but you know , whatever . </ i>
<i>that' s the url to their website . </ i>
<i>and then , i can' t seem to find joe hiert' s number . </ i>
<i>i was looking all over at home .
it' s somewhere there .

<i>i' il get that to you tomorrow , if that' s okay . </ i>

<i>i don' t have time for this actually .
we' re trying to have an office party . </ i>
uh huh .
<i>look , if you were calling for a comment on your story, </ i>
<i>i don' t have one, </ i> <i>other than to say , i wish you' d never run the stupid thing . </ i>
<i>that stuff was supposed to be off the record, </ i> <i>and your reporter knows it , that glass guy . </ i>
<i> i' m calling to verify information .
i' m not verifying anything . </ i>
<i>bottom line is , i' d like you guys to basically get lost , okay ? </ i>
<i>hello ? </ i>
<i> hey .
david . </ i>
<i> i' m sorry , steve .
shit . </ i>
<i>i didn' t mean to startle you .
i thought you' d like a cup of coffee . </ i>

working late . </ i>
<i>working on my article , so i don' t get shredded again . </ i>
<i> thank you .
you' re welcome . </ i>
<i>i always forget to ask you .
how are your studies coming ? </ i>
<i>their fine .
i' m ... just buried . </ i>
<i>you' re buried .

i should probably let you get back to it . </ i>
<i> is there anything you need ?
no .
good night , david . </ i>
good night .
thanks , steve .
<i>i got it . </ i>
hello ?
chuck ?
it' s steve .
hi , steve .
<i>sorry to be calling so late . </ i>
<i>i was just wondering ... </ i> <i>did you get a call from the jukt guy ?
george sims ? </ i>
<i> i did , yeah .
yeah .
i was just sitting here, </ i> <i>and i realized that i' d given him your home number</ i> <i>without asking you first .
and i wanted to apologize . </ i>
<i> it' s fine .
sort of a prick , didn' t you think ? </ i>
<i>i couldn' t really tell because he hung up so fast . </ i>
<i> are you at home , steve ?
no .
why ? </ i>
<i>i left a message on your machine . </ i>
<i>those forbes guys want to talk to us again . </ i>
<i>there' s a conference call at 9 : 00 a . m . </ i>
<i>sure .
sounds like a party . </ i>
yeah ?
<i> okay , night , chuck .
see you in the morning . </ i>
<i>that' s weird . </ i>
<i>morning . </ i>
hey .
<i> want a laugh ?
sure . </ i>
<i> the website for jukt micronics .
oh , good . </ i>
yeah , you might not think so when you see what' s on it .
<i>i don' t think mr. sims liked our piece that much . </ i>
<i>yeah .
and i found this too , from my fridge for some reason . </ i>
<i>lan restil' s agent , joe hiert . </ i>
<i>i' d like to pause for a moment . </ i>
<i>you can' t go into the world of journalism without first understanding</ i> how a piece gets edited at a place like " tnr .
<i>this is a system that michael kelly brought with him from the new yorker . </ i>
<i>a three day torture test . </ i>
<i>if your article' s good , the process will only make it better . </ i>
<i>if your article' s shaky , you' re in for a long week . </ i>
<i>a story comes in , and it goes to a senior editor . </ i>
<i>he , or she , edits it on computer, </ i> <i>then calls in the writer , who makes revisions . </ i>
<i>then the piece goes to a second editor , and the writer revises it again . </ i>
<i>then it goes through a fact check , where every fact in the piece ... </ i> <i>every date , every title, </ i> <i>every place or assertion is checked and verified . </ i>
<i>then the piece goes to a copy editor , where it is scrutinized once again . </ i>
<i>then it goes to lawyers , who apply their own burdens of proof . </ i>
<i>marty looks at it too .
he' s very concerned with any kind of comment</ i> <i>the magazine is making . </ i>
<i>then production takes it , and lays it out into column inches and type . </ i>
<i>then it goes back on paper , then back to the writer, </ i> <i>back to the copy editor , back to editor number one, </ i> <i>and editor number two , back to the fact checker , back to the writer, </ i> <i>and back to production again . </ i>
<i>throughout , those lawyers are reading and re reading, </ i>
<i>looking for red flags , anything that feels uncorroborated . </ i>
<i>once they' re satisfied , the pages are reprinted and it all happens again . </ i>
<i>every editor , the fact checkers ... they all go through it one last time . </ i>
<i>now , most of you will start out as interns somewhere . </ i>
<i>and interns do a lot of fact checking , so pay close attention . </ i>
<i>there' s a hole in the fact checking system . </ i>
a big one .
<i>the facts in most pieces can be checked against some type of source material . </ i>
<i>if an article' s on , say , ethanol subsidies, </ i> <i>you could check for discrepancies against the congressional record, </ i> <i>trade publications , lexisnexis, </ i> <i>and footage from c span . </ i>
<i>but on other pieces, </ i> <i>the only source material available</ i> <i>are the notes provided by the reporter himself . </ i>
steve ?
<i>this doesn' t look like a real business card to me . </ i>
yeah , i know .
that' s the kind of clown this guy is .
<i>he won' t even pay to have real cards made . </ i>
<i>all right . </ i>
my office at 9 : 00 , okay ?
yeah .
<i>good morning . </ i>
<i>a few other people we can' t seem to locate ... </ i>
<i>julie farthwork , frank juliet</ i> <i>and ian restil' s agent , joe hiert . </ i>
<i>we called the numbers you gave us , got voicemails for all three . </ i>
<i>and the e mails were sent back " no address " or " account closed . " </ i>
really ?
' cause i' ve e mailed them about a million times each .
<i>hiert' s online all day long . </ i>
<i>did you call these people and get them directly ? </ i>
no , i always left messages and spoke to them when they called me back .
<i>and the references in the article to nevada law enforcement officials . </ i>
<i>was jim ghort the only one you spoke to ? </ i>
<i> yes .
do you have a number for him ? </ i>
<i> yeah , definitely .
by the way , what was your basis</ i> <i>for writing that jukt was a big time software company ? </ i>
<i>i didn' t .
that was added by the copy desk , or during editorial . </ i>
<i>was the hackers ' conference where you met the jukt executives ... </ i>
<i>that part of the article is misleading . </ i>
<i>i was never in the restils ' home at all . </ i>
<i>you weren' t in restil' s home , with the jukt executives ? </ i>
no , i didn' t mean to imply that i had been .
<i>sorry about that .
did the fax come through okay ? </ i>
yes , it did .
<i>i think the address must' ve gotten garbled .
we can' t find the site . </ i>
<i> you want to read it back to me ?
sure . </ i>
<i>you gave us " members .
aol .
juktn .
html . " </ i>
<i> wait .
was that an " m " ?
i' m sorry ? </ i>
<i>after jukt , was that an " m , " as in " micronics " ? </ i>
<i>no , it was an " n " , as in " not working . " </ i>
<i> try " m.
okay . </ i>
<i>sorry about that , i was rushing . </ i>
<i>of course . </ i>
<i>but i do find myself wondering , stephen . </ i>
<i>why would a major software company put their website</ i> <i>where only aol members can access it , as opposed to the entire web ? </ i>
i have no idea .
<i>i don' t have a website so i don' t really know that much about them . </ i>
<i>i would trust you guys to know better than me . </ i>
okay .
looks like ... we have the jukt website up now .
i have to say , stephen ... <i>this looks very suspicious to me . </ i>
how so ?
<i>quite frankly , it doesn' t look like a real website . </ i>
<i>it looks like a site that was ... created to fool someone . </ i>
<i>i don' t know much about computers .
could somebody do that ? </ i>
<i> of course .
very easily . </ i>
<i>so easily , in fact , it' s incredible . </ i>
<i>do you still want that number for jim ghort ?
i found it in my notes . </ i>
<i>yeah , sure . </ i>
<i>all right .
605 , 84 ... </ i>
<i> wait .
sorry ? </ i>
<i>" six zero five , " that' s not nevada . </ i>
oh .
<i>i guess i got him mixed up with another source . </ i>
<i>er ... </ i>
<i>sorry about that one .
oh , you know what it was ? </ i>
<i>jim ghort was the guy who told me about the law enforcement officials . </ i>
<i>i don' t know what i was thinking .
i' m going to have to get you ... </ i>
<i>steve . </ i>
<i>give him the number . </ i>
this guy is toast .
<i>all right , stephen , in light of all this, </ i> <i>how confident are you in this story of yours ? </ i>
<i>are we off the record ? </ i>
if you like .
<i>well , off the record ... </ i> <i>some of the things that you' ve brought up ... </ i> the website ... <i>the idea that i was always speaking to these people through voicemail ... </ i> <i>that is , that they were always calling me ... </ i> <i>it didn' t seem strange before , but clearly, </ i> <i>there are some problems with the story .
you' ve pointed them out . </ i>
<i>one portion of it was structured in a way that ... </ i>
i just ... well ... in light of all this ...
i just ...
<i>i' m increasingly beginning to believe that i' ve been duped . </ i>
<i>and so we hang up, </ i> <i>after he' s basically let these guys interrogate me for an hour . </ i>
<i>and i go , " chuck , wh what happened ? </ i>
i mean , why didn' t you back me up ?
<i>he goes , " i' m sorry , steve , i' ve got to protect the magazine . </ i>
<i> i mean , i' m the editor .
typical . </ i>
<i>he' s being such an asshole .
so i' m dead , pretty much . </ i>
yes , this is kambiz .
<i>can we have a talk here ?
just editor to editor ? </ i>
<i>sure .
go ahead . </ i>
<i>completely off the record , and really almost human being to human being ? </ i>
<i>of course . </ i>
<i>you guys have discovered something that a troubled kid has done, </ i> but i still don' t know how you plan to play it .
<i>we' re not in the business of " gotcha " journalism here . </ i>
<i>i have no interest in embarrassing you or the new republic . </ i>
<i>i' m not worried about me or the magazine .
that' s fair game, </ i>
<i>but there' s a kid here who basically, </ i> <i>just plainly , screwed up .
big time . </ i>
<i>his reporting was sloppy , we know that . </ i>
<i>but we' re trying to handle it internally at this point, </ i> just as you would .
<i>listen , we' re going to run something</ i> <i>along the lines of , " a trick was pulled, </ i> <i>and some very clever hackers managed to create an illusion . " </ i>
<i>i can' t tell you what to print or not to print . </ i>
<i>you guys are journalists . </ i>
<i>but ... he could be very hurt by what you guys publish .
his career . </ i>
<i>chuck , i understand .
i do . </ i>
i would hope if i made the mistakes he made , <i>people would be generous with me . </ i>
<i>but ... </ i> <i>this concerns the very field we cover . </ i>
<i>we have to run it . </ i>
<i>and when we do , we' re going to need a comment from you . </ i>
<i>so given everything that' s happened, </ i> <i>how strongly are you going to stand behind the story ? </ i>
i' m looking into it .
<i>it' s really not that big a deal .
you got fooled by a source . </ i>
<i>it happens .
they' il print a retraction , and that' il be that . </ i>
<i>steve , it' s not like it' s going to hurt your career . </ i>
<i>of course , if you weren' t so distracted by your classes, </ i>
<i> maybe this never would' ve happened .
i know , i gotta quit .
you' re right . </ i>
<i>can i speak to you for a minute , steve ? </ i>
what about ?
<i>let' s do it in private . </ i>
<i>we need to take a drive to bethesda . </ i>
<i> what for ?
i want to meet joe hiert . </ i>
<i>i already told you , nobody knows where he is . </ i>
<i>maybe if we go to the hotel where he met with restil and sims, </ i> <i>someone will remember him , or have some clue ... </ i>
<i>there were hundreds of people there , okay ? </ i>
<i>these forbes guys want to come down on you . </ i>
<i>they are highly suspicious about some of the material in that article . </ i>
you know that .
yeah .
<i>but they' re going to go online with their piece tomorrow . </ i>
oh .
okay ?
yeah .
now ...
steve ?
steve .
yeah ?
<i>if we can find hiert, </ i>
<i>i can back them off for a day or two , okay ? </ i>
okay .
i' il get my notes .
okay .
<i> let' s go .
all right . </ i>
<i>we were at this table . </ i>
<i>restil sat here , his mother was on his left, </ i>
<i>hiert ... sorry , his mother was on his right . </ i>
<i>hiert sat there, </ i> <i>but restil wanted him closer , so he slid his chair over . </ i>
<i>sims sat here .
he had a lawyer next to him . </ i>
<i>i forget the guy' s name , it' s in my notes . </ i>
<i>somebody was smoking at this table, </ i> <i>so restil' s mother insisted that we move to one farther away . </ i>
<i>over there . </ i>
<i>the hacker conference was near here , right ? </ i>
<i>yeah , the building next door . </ i>
<i>i don' t remember from the article .
how many people were at this thing ? </ i>
<i>it looked like a hundred , might have been two .
it' s in my notes . </ i>
<i>200 people ?
here ? </ i>
<i>yeah , they moved in and out .
i mean , most of them were kids . </ i>
<i>that doesn' t seem credible to me . </ i>
<i>all i know is i was here . </ i>
<i>all of us were right here . </ i>
<i> excuse me sir , can i help you ?
yes , you can . </ i>
<i>we' re looking into a conference held here a couple of sundays ago . </ i>
<i>computer hackers .
do you remember anything like that ? </ i>
<i>are you sure you' re in the right building , sir ? </ i>
<i> yes , we' re sure .
why is that ? </ i>
building' s closed on sunday .
<i>all i know is , i was here . </ i>
<i>the conference was right here . </ i>
that' s why the restils only stayed a few minutes , okay ?
because it was such a dumb place to squeeze into .
<i>so they went to a restaurant for dinner , with some of ian' s hacker friends . </ i>
thank you .
how many ?
huh ?
<i>people at the dinner .
how many ? </ i>
about 10 , i think , including me .
<i>lan even put on a jacket . </ i>
<i> hiert was there too ?
yeah . </ i>
<i> is it near here ?
yeah , it' s across the street . </ i>
<i>good , let' s cross the street . </ i>
<i>you know , i really don' t like the way you' re treating me , chuck . </ i>
it' s like you won' t even talk to me .
this is the place ?
yes .
<i>i didn' t do anything wrong , okay ?
i didn' t do anything wrong . </ i>
<i>you saw my notes , everything was in there . </ i>
<i>i got tricked .
i got fooled , i' m sorry .
what are you being so mad for ? </ i>
it was 10 people ?
yes .
<i> for dinner ?
yes . </ i>
<i>they' re closed at 3 : 00 on sundays . </ i>
yeah , i know .
i know , they almost didn' t let us in .
okay ?
<i>but it was a couple of minutes before 3 : 00, </ i> <i>and ian looked like he was about ready to cry , and so they said okay . </ i>
<i> but for dinner ?
go in and ask them yourself , chuck . </ i>
<i>see if they would serve a party that came in at 2 : 58</ i> <i>and the answer would be yes , because that' s when we got here . </ i>
<i>the forbes guys are gonna have all this too, </ i> <i>and dig through the records at that office building . </ i>
<i>they have surveillance cameras and they' re gonna check them . </ i>
<i>i didn' t do anything wrong , chuck ! </ i>
<i>i really wish you' d stop saying that ! </ i>
steve ... come on , anyone can make a mistake .
<i>you know , this is not right , chuck ! </ i>
<i>okay , i feel really attacked . </ i>
<i>and you' re my editor .
you' re supposed to support me, </ i> <i>and you' re taking their word against mine ? </ i>
<i>you' re supposed to support me ! </ i>
<i>criticism of the president' s program has been ... </ i>
<i>leave it off . </ i>
<i>i' m sorry i yelled at you back there . </ i>
chuck ?
steve !
<i> pull the goddamn car over .
yeah . </ i>
<i>all right . </ i>
<i>there' s been so much pressure . </ i>
<i>chuck , i didn' t mean to get anybody in trouble . </ i>
okay .
okay .
<i>you weren' t at the conference ? </ i>
no .
<i>you know , i had a description of it from so many sources, </ i>
i thought i had it solid .
okay ?
and i wanted the piece to have an eyewitness feel to it , <i>for color ... so ...
i said i' d been there myself . </ i>
<i>and everything we just told the forbes guys ... ? </ i>
<i>i' m so sorry , chuck . </ i>
i just panicked .
if you want me to say that i made it up ...
i will .
if that' il help you , i' il say it .
<i>i just want you to tell me the truth , steve . </ i>
can you do that ?
<i>there might be facets of this that you' re not considering . </ i>
<i> why are you defending him ?
nobody' s defending him , chuck . </ i>
<i> of course you' re defending him .
he' s a kid . </ i>
<i>he doctored his notes , lew .
just consider that for a second . </ i>
you know ?
he sat down , <i>and he hand wrote a bunch of phony quotes</ i> <i>and handed them in as source material for the fact check . </ i>
<i> doesn' t that offend you ?
of course it does . </ i>
<i>he also lied to his editor .
that' s supposed to offend you too . </ i>
<i>he' s a confused , distraught kid obviously , chuck . </ i>
<i>so suspend him for a couple of months , but let' s not bury him . </ i>
suspend him ...
<i>there are also political considerations to take into account here ... </ i> <i>the rest of the staff , the way they feel about him . </ i>
<i> i already know all that .
what i' m saying is, </ i> <i>if you fire him , some of these people will leave . </ i>
i don' t know if we' d still have a magazine at the end of the day .
hey , caitlin .
not now , david .
<i> how' s he doing ?
well , he' s a wreck , of course . </ i>
<i> i want him in here , caitlin .
he' s too scared to come in here . </ i>
<i>he thinks you want to destroy him .
he knows what he did was horrible . </ i>
he knows how badly he messed up .
<i>the part he' s most upset about is iying to you , chuck . </ i>
<i>because he knows you took it as a sign of disrespect</ i> instead of a panic move , which is what it was .
<i>think about the workload he' s been carrying ... all this and classes . </ i>
<i>he hasn' t slept more than two hours in nine months . </ i>
<i>so he got a little sloppy and he lied to cover his tracks . </ i>
he' s sick about it .

he just made it up .
so ... ?
obviously he needs some help .
<i> he needs help .
just get him in here . </ i>
<i>you can' t fire him . </ i>
<i>i don' t think he' il survive . </ i>
<i>you don' t understand , we' re all he has . </ i>
<i>you can' t fire him , chuck . </ i>
