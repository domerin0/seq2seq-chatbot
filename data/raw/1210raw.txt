yes .
yes .
yes .
please .
please .
don' t worry .
don' t worry .
it' s utter chaos around here .
and i' m terrified that we' re running out of time .
am i trying to be too perfect ?
oh , but i want it to be so exquisite .
so do we .
but we' re trying to be too exquisite .
why not aim for the stars ?
good morning .
good morning .
we do need some answers on the flowers .
ah , yes , freesia , freesia .
everywhere freesia .
daddy loves freesia .
good morning .
good morning .
oh .
hello .
hi .
lights ?
" lights .
not too bright and not too dark .
i' m looking for a saffron glow , sort of tea dance ' 20s .
if food is the prose of a party , then lights are its poetry .
it works .
if food is the prose of a party , lights are its poetry .
i like that .
if music were the food of love , play on .
i' m going out of my mind .
good morning , mr. parrish .
what do you think of all this , helen ?
it' s gonna be beautiful .
and allison says the president may come .
the president' s got better things to do than come to my birthday party .
like what ?
daddy ?
do you have a minute ?
good morning , allison .
not much more .
big day in the big city .
what' s on your mind ?
fireworks .
we are constructing the number 65 on the barge .
mm hmm .
archers from the state college of new paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it .
when it catches fire , it will give us the effect of a viking funeral , but with none of the morbidity .
the hudson river authority says that for you , they' il make a special dispensation .
but , of course , there will be an overtime bill ... for the poughkeepsie fire department .
so , what do you think ?
good ?
no good ?
allison , i trust you .
this is your thing .
but it' s your birthday .
i hate arrows .
they make me nervous .
good morning , dad .
good morning , honey .
morning .
morning .
you' re " honey . " i' m " allison .
oh .
dad , drew called from the helicopter , and they' re still two minutes away .
drew' s aboard ?
mm hmm .
he wanted to ride back down with you .
why don' t you sit down , relax , and get some food in that flat tummy of yours .
are you coming ?
no .
you' ve got patients to attend to .
i' ve got three hysterical chefs , one of whom loves truffles , the other one hates truffles , and the third one doesn' t even know what truffles are .
i hate parties .
but , daddy , calm down .
you' re gonna love it .
i swear .
isn' t it enough to be on the earth for 65 years without having to be reminded of it ?
no .
will you relax ?
i know it' s a big deal day .
how' d you know that ?
drew told me .
does he tell you everything ?
i hope so .
you like him , don' t you ?
yep , i guess so .
i don' t want to interfere , but , uh ...
then don' t .
well , here comes our boy now .
shall we ?
okay .
hello , beautiful .
hi .
good morning , drew .
thanks for coming up .
well , big day .
wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff .
any thoughts , last minute refinements , variations , anything ?
thoughts , no .
i did hear a voice last night .
a voice ?
in my sleep .
what' d it say ?
" yes .
yes to the deal ?
maybe .
who knows ?
you know how voices are .
hmm ?
i thank you , delia .
okay , let' s go .
delia , your pen .
hi , bill .
how you doin ' ?
morning , quince .
i' m doin ' great , and you ?
oh , i' m great .
this is it , " b day .
huh ?
sorry .
bontecou day .
we' re gonna close ... with big john .
look at you , bill .
you' re all cool as a cat .
over at bontecou' s , i' il bet he' s just shittin ' in his pants .
remember , everybody , big meeting tonight at daddy' s .
dinner .
you , too , drew .
we have lots of loose ends .
not my birthday again ?
you' re only 65 once , dad .
thank god .
now let' s get the day started .
remember , dinner in the city at daddy' s !
mm hmm .
it' s so ridiculous .
do you love drew ?
no , don' t do anything .
just stay exactly where ...
do you love drew ?
he' s not gonna get a better offer than that .
you mean , like you loved mom ?
forget about me and mom .
are you gonna marry him ?
oh , come on .
i' m probably .
listen , i' m crazy about the guy .
he' s smart .
he' s aggressive .
he could carry parrish communications into the 21st century and me along with it .
mm hmm .
so , what' s wrong with that ?
that' s for me .
i' m talking about you .
it' s not what you say about drew .
it' s what you don' t say .
maybe you' re not listening .
oh , yes , i am .
give him whatever he wants .
there' s not an ounce of excitement , not a ... whisper of a thrill .
and this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice .
i want you to get swept away out there .
i want you to levitate .
i want you to ... sing with rapture and dance like a dervish .
oh , that' s all .
yeah .
be deliriously happy , or at least leave yourself open to be .
okay .
be deliriously happy .
i shall , uh ...
i shall do my utmost .
i know it' s a cornball thing .
but love is passion , obsession , someone you can' t live without .
i say , fall head over heels .
find someone you can love like crazy and who will love you the same way back .
how do you find him ?
well , you forget your head , and you listen to your heart .
and i' m not hearing any heart .
' cause the truth is , honey , there' s no sense living your life without this .
to make the journey and not fall deeply in love , well , you haven' t lived a life at all .
but you have to try , ' cause if you haven' t tried , you haven' t lived .
bravo !
oh , you' re tough .
i' m sorry .
okay .
give it to me again , but the short version this time .
okay .
stay open .
who knows ?
lightning could strike .
yeah ?
yeah .
what do you think ?
is it just the executive committee , or are you guys gonna use me ?
quince , man , thanks for the offer , but it' s all set for just me and bill .
more people might ...
i know .
i know , gum up the works .
i want you to get swept away .
huh ?
i was just sayin ' to quince that we won' t need him until ...
did you hear something ?
yeah , but i was just sayin ' to quince ...
no , no , no .
not you .
what' s the matter , daddy ?
nothing .
i' m sorry .
i want you to levitate .
i want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish .
" dance like a dervish " ?
daddy , what is it ?
nothing , i' m just talking to myself .
you know me .
no , i' ve never known you to talk to yourself .
oh , well , can i give you a lift ?
no , i' m gonna catch a cab .
listen , are you okay ?
yeah .
got my garters on , my ears pricked ... ready for action .
okay .
well ...
go get ' em , pops .
you' re damn right .
okay .
mm hmm .
mm hmm .
oh , haven' t heard that one before .
i' m sorry .
i had to say it .
honey ?
honey ?
hi , george .
honey , you have to go on .
okay ?
there' s a time to sow and a time to reap .
you have to sow .
sorry .
excuse me .
no , i liked him .
i don' t like him anymore .
' cause you' re my honey .
someone messes with you , they mess with me .
that' s it .
i' m on a plane in a heartbeat .
you let me know .
yep , when i get my phone in , you' re my first call .
i promise .
hit the books , get the degree .
one day we' il be hanging out a shingle together .
how' s that ?
mmm ?
okay .

yes .
you bet .
be strong .
i love you .
bye bye .
morning .
good morning .
i was talkin ' kind of loud there .
i' m sorry .
oh , not at all .
it was fascinating .
yeah , what was fascinating about it ?
um ...
you and , uh , " honey " ?
it' s my kid sister .
oh .
and she just broke up with her boyfriend and was thinking ... about dropping out of law school .
oh , i' m sorry .
no , nothing to be sorry about .
that' s the way it is with men and women , isn' t it ?
what' s the way ?
nothing lasts .
oh .
yeah , i agree .
really ?
why ?
no , i' m interested .
i was just trying to be agreeable .
okay .
all right .
i was sharp shooting .
oh .
no , just that " nothing lasts " stuff .
that was the problem with honey' s guy .
he didn' t know what he wanted .
so , he' s fooling around , and she catches him at it .
you know , like one girlfriend isn' t enough for him .
so , you' re a one girl guy .
yes , i am .
that' s right .
right .
looking for her right now , actually .
mmm .
who knows ?
you might be her .
no , don' t laugh .
i just got into town .
i got the new job .
i' m trying to get into this apartment .
anyway , so you' re a doctor .
mmm .
how' d you know ?
' cause everyone' s a doctor around here .
this apartment building ...
everyone' s in green slippers , the green pajamas .
the guy i' m waiting for to vacate ...
doctor .
he' s a doctor .
what kind of doctor ?
i' m a resident ... internal medicine .
so , if i needed a doctor , you could be it .
i could be her .
yeah .
you could be ... her .
uh huh .
yeah , i could .
i' m i' m working at the hospital , so ...
i see .
this is my lucky day .
i just get in the big , bad city , not only do i find a doctor , but a beautiful woman , as well .
do you mind me saying that ?
oh ...
no , of course .
no , it' s fine .
it' s fine .
it' s just ...
listen , could i buy you a cup of coffee ?
i have some patients coming in , so i should probably ...
yeah , yeah .
get goin ' .
i gotta get to the apartment and get off to work .
yeah .
but i' d still like to have another cup of coffee .
um ...
would you let me do that ?
well , yeah , okay .

mmm .
good morning , mr. parrish .

so , board convenes tomorrow .
you' il recommend we close , and it' s a deal , right ?
as close as a deal could be .
olympic .
yes .
yes .
" yes " what ?
yes is the answer to your question .
ah .
i didn' t ask any question .
i believe you did .
who are you ?
goddamn it .
what' s going on here ?
i think you know .
i don' t .
try .
' cause if you haven' t tried , you haven' t lived .
what are you talking about ?
what you were talking about .
who is this guy ?
tell me who you are .
are you giving me orders ?
no .
i' m sorry , i ...
no , you' re not .
you' re trying to handle the situation .
but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle .
it' s enough ... now .
huh ?
talk to me , please .
there' s gonna be plenty of time for that .
what do you mean ?
i think you know , bill .
it' s kind of a pro bono job .
" pro bono " ?
yeah .
meaning , doing good ?
that' s me .
gonna be doing good all your life ?
i know what you' re saying .
it doesn' t pay so well , but , i like it .
mm hmm .
eventually it' il depend on the woman i marry , i think .
maybe she' il want lots of kids , a bigger house , better car , uh ...
college doesn' t come cheap .
you know ?
i don' t know .
wow .
give up what you want for the woman you marry .
hmm .
yeah , you know what ?
i would .
yeah ?
gladly .
' cause you make your choices , you know ?
say , you and i , if we were married , i would ...
no , for an example , okay ?
if you and i were married , i would want to give you what you need .
that' s all .
i' m talking about taking care of each other the best you can .
what' s wrong with taking care of a woman ?
she takes care of you .
you' il have a hard time finding a woman like that these days .
shoot , you think so ?
mm hmm .
i don' t know .
lightning could strike .
i' ve gotta go .
yeah .
listen , did i say something wrong ?
no ?
no .
no .
no .
it was ...
sure ?
it was so right , it scares me .
that' s all .
just ...
you know , i was thinking , i don' t want you to be my doctor .
i don' t want you to ... examine me and ...
why ?
because i like you so much .
and i ...
i don' t want to examine you .
you don' t ?
why not ?
because i like you so much .
oh , boy .
okay .
now i gotta go , so ...
yep , understood .
all right .
all right .
fair enough .
see ya .
bye .
bye .
bye bye .
music .
i know how you love music , daddy .
and i want to have music that pleases you , but doesn' t put a thousand other people to sleep .
i' ve agonized over it and finally settled on sidney brown .
good .
twenty four men ... very eclectic .
mm hmm .
plus , i' m feathering in a latin sextet on their breaks .
you haven' t heard a word i' ve said , have you ?
what , honey ?
sorry .
daddy .
yes .
daddy ?
mr. parrish ?
yes ?
dinner' s served .
yeah .
never mind .
leave it to me .
did you miss me , bill ?
chow time , you guys .
what are you looking so provoked about ?
did you miss me ?
it' s a normal question .
i missed you .
but what do i get back ?
not an ounce of excitement .
not a whisper of a thrill .
this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice .
i' m waiting outside the front door .
did you speak to the governor ?
he' s coming .
and his wife ?
yeah , unfortunately .
i sat between them at the bronx zoo benefit .
it was better than seconal .
i' m waiting outside the front door , bill .
won' t someone let me in ?
lillian ?
is there somebody at the front door ?
i didn' t hear a ring , sir .
have a look , would you , please ?
what about the mayor ?
he said he' s going to be there with bells on .
good .
maybe they' il drown him out .
please don' t be negative , drew .
i' m sorry .
the chairman of the f. c. c. , the secretary general of the u. n. ,
wow . nine senators ,
i don' t know how many congressmen and at least 12 of the fortune 500 .
any jocks ?
hmm ?
no .
no 20 game winner , masters champion , someone i can talk to ?
you were right , mr. parrish .
there was a gentleman at the door .
he' s waiting for you in the foyer .
show him into the library .
tell him i' il be right there .
yes , sir .
i' ve arranged favors , silver charm bracelets for the women ,
mmm .
and platinum key chains for the men , all engraved " w. p.
but now i' m thinking of scrubbing them .
they seem so ordinary .
are they ordinary ?
do they seem that way to you , daddy ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
i , uh ...
let me see .
i don' t think they' re ordinary .
i think they' re great .
i love key chains .
hello ?
anyone here ?
i said , is anyone here ?
quiet down .
where are you ?
i' m here .
what is this , a joke , right ?
some kind of elaborate practical joke ?
at my 40th reunion , we delivered a casket ... to the class president' s hotel room and , uh ...
quiet .
where are you going , bill ?
i , uh ...
the great bill parrish at a loss for words ?
the man from whose lips fall " rapture " and " passion " and " obsession " ?
all those admonitions about being " deliriously happy , that there is no sense living your life without .
all the sparks and energy you give off , the rosy advice you dispense in round , pear shaped tones .
what the hell is this ?
who are you ?
just think of millenniums multiplied by eons ... compounded by time without end .
i' ve been around that long .
but it' s only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest .
call it boredom .
the natural curiosity of me , the most lasting ... and significant element in existence , has come to see you .
about what ?
i want to have a look around before i take you .
take me where ?
it requires competence , wisdom and experience .
all those things they say about you in testimonials .
and you' re the one .
the one to do what ?
show me around , be my guide .
and in return , you get ...
i get what ?
minutes , days , weeks .
let' s not get encumbered by detail .
what matters is that i stay interested .
yes .
yes " what ?
yes is the answer to your question .
what question ?
oh , bill .
come on .
the question .
the question you' ve been asking yourself with increased regularity , at odd moments , panting through the extra game of handball , when you ran for the plane in delhi , when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning .
the question that is in the back of your throat , choking the blood to your brain , ringing in your ears over and over as you put it to yourself .
" the question .
yes , bill .
the question .
the question .
am i going to die ?
yes .
am i dreaming this ?
are you a dream ?
i' m not a dream .
you' re coming to take me ?
what is that ?
and who the hell are you ?
you are ...
yes ?
who am i ?
death .
you' re death ?
yes .
death .
that' s me .
you' re not death .
you' re just a kid in a suit .
the suit came with the body i took .
let me ask your opinion .
do i blend in ?
you want me to be your guide ?
you fill the bill , bill .
i do ?
mmm .
will you be staying long ?
we should hope quite a while .
and then ?
it' s over .
it' s over .
mr. parrish ?
will the gentleman be staying for dinner , sir ?
yes .
thank you .
this is crazy .
you' re not gonna eat dinner with us .
no , i am eating dinner with you ... and your family .
and that is what we' re doing .
it' s not open for discussion , nothing is .
don' t you understand ?
yeah .
good .
now lead the way .
bill ,
lead the way .
excuse me , may i say something ?
yes , of course .
well , it just occurred to me , if , uh ...
speak up , please .
when i introduce you , if i say who you are ,
i don' t think anyone will stay for dinner .
then don' t .
here' s another possibility .
it' s a little last minute , but tell me what you think .
kaleidoscopes .
little gold kaleidoscopes .
some german company went kerplunk , and tiffany' s picked all these things up , and they' re perfect party favors .
okay , they' re not personalized or anything .
they' re just winter scenes ... dachshunds , snowflakes .
hi there .
hello .
sorry to have ... stepped away for so long .
this is a friend of mine i asked to drop by .
we got to talking and stuff , and , uh ...
he' s gonna join us for dinner .
great .
how nice to meet you .
and wouldn' t it be nicer if my father would introduce you ?
how nice to meet you .
yeah , i' m sorry .
this is my daughter , allison , and her husband , quince , and drew , my number one , works with me .
daddy , does your friend have a name ?
a name ?
something he goes by ?
oh , yeah , excuse me .
this is , uh ...
this is , um ...
daddy , come on .
a name .
bill , the suspense is killing me .
i' m sorry .
it' s , uh ...
it' s gone right out of my head .
um ...
i' m sorry .

joe .
joe .
i love that name .
just plain joe .

black .
oh , at last .
nice to meet you , mr. black .
hey , hey , joe black .

i' m king of my rotisserie league .

he' s from out of town .
how long you here for , joe ?
as long as it takes .
you and bill , you old friends ?
no .
no , thank you .
i have one , thank you .
i get the feeling you' ve done some business before .
i got it .
have you done some business before ?
we have an arrangement now .
what side of the industry did you say you were on ?
i didn' t say .
joe sounds like a ringer , bill .
i have a feeling you guys got the broad strokes already .
you need any help with the details ?
i' m sorry , business at dinner .
forgive me for being so rude .
certainly .
hi , everybody .
i' m sorry i' m late .
i had to have dinner with my department chief .
you ate ?
i' m here , aren' t i ?
i wouldn' t miss a loose ends meeting .
what' s on the table for discussion ?
party favors , flowers ...
hi , dad .
hi .
hello .
hi , drew .
what are you doing here ?
you know each other ?
we' ve met .
this morning , the corinth coffee shop .
he was , uh ...
he was looking for a doctor .
well , i guess he' s found one .
joe , you do get around .
that' s your name ?
and isn' t it a lovely one ?
so sturdy , so straight .

incidentally , joe , where are you staying ?
here .
you' re staying here ?
in this house ?
yes , in this house .

great .
great .
will that hold you , joe ?
incidentally , joe what ?
black .
this is fun .
yes .
yes , quince , it is .
so , what are you doing here , joe ?
cat got your tongue ?
you weren' t so silent this morning .
this morning , yes .
i wasn' t quite myself .
well , it' s a shame whoever you were couldn' t be here tonight .
cut it out , susan .
we' ve gotta talk .
cut it out , susan .
we' ve gotta talk .
busy day tomorrow , everybody .
joe , let' s go .
yes .
that stuff between you and susan threw me .
threw you ?
where ?
shook me up .
i mean , how is it that you happened to meet my daughter ?
i didn' t meet her .
the young man i took met her .
that is , the fellow she encountered in the coffee shop this morning .
what happened to him ?
i needed a body , bill .
so ,
come in .
uh , bathroom , tub , towels , sauna , chairs , lamps , bed .
well , if there is anything else , don' t hesitate .
i won' t .
i can try .
will she be available next week ?
i don' t know .
yes , sir ?
hello .
i' m joe black .
it' s nice meeting you .
yes , of course , mr. black , sir .
a pleasure .
eh ...
what is that ?
you mean this , sir ?
yes .
it' s , uh , laura scudder' s peanut butter , sir .
you like it ?
well , i would say , in my opinion , it' s right up there with jif and skippy .
could i offer you a taste , sir ?
yes .
all right .
do you fancy it , sir ?
more ?
right .
mmm .
mmm .
you' re a peanut butter man now , eh , sir ?
yes , i believe i am .
i thoroughly enjoy this peanut butter .
and i thoroughly enjoyed meeting you all .
i' il be moseying on .
right , sir .
what are you doing here ?
i' m lost .
i can' t seem to escape you today .
i' m sorry .
yeah .
would you hand me one of those ?
you must have something very ... big going on with my father .
big ?
yeah .
you appear at his side out of the blue , stay at his house , have dinner with his family .
that' s , uh , practically a first .
you' re in the red hot center of big business , and i thought you were just a regular joe .
i am joe .
not the one that i met this morning .
hitting on me in as nice a way as i' ve been hit on in a long time .
the second that you found out i was my father' s daughter , you , uh ...
well , you acted like a stranger .
that is not my intention .
what are your intentions ?
huh ?
i mean , just to , uh , make little dramas in coffee shops , turn a woman' s head ?
i don' t mind admitting that my my head was turned .
i i liked it .
but , well , ten hours later , i feel like a fool .
i just don' t get it .
i don' t .
you , my father , here in this house .
it' s , uh ...
it' s upsetting me , and i ...
what happened to that sweet guy from the coffee shop ?
who are you , anyway ?
and ... what are you eating ?
peanut butter .
hmm .
but it' s gone now .
wh ...
no .
please .
you act like you' ve never had peanut butter before .
i haven' t .
what kind of childhood did you have ?
do you love drew ?
excuse me ?
when you put your mouth to his , it seemed a frequent thing .
drew is none of your business , and neither is where i put my mouth .
i' m sorry .
do you live here ?
no , joe , i' m swimming here and now i' m going home .
yes , i think what i' m trying to say is ,
i would like it if we were friends .
i' ve got plenty of friends .
i don' t have any .
well , i can see why .
i didn' t mean to offend you at dinner .
i' m sometimes ... not quite at home around people .
and i don' t seem to have developed ...
yes ?
i have a certain function to perform , and it seems to take up most of my time .
but sometimes i ... speculate ... that i haven' t left room for ... anything else .
hmm .
i' m sorry to say i know what you mean .
well , um ...
good night , joe .
yes .
good night to you , susan .
morning , madeline .
oh , good morning , mr. parrish .
everything okay ?
yes , sir .
good .
morning .
good morning , bill .
what' s on the docket for today ?
docket ?
hmm , yes .
what shall we do ?
well , i have to go to work , and ...
splendid .
i' il join you .
oh .
would you like to ride or walk ?
walk .
i wish to see the world .
this is crazy .
this is the left field thing of all time .
i , uh ...
i don' t know if i can get through this .
what do i do ?
what do i tell my family ?
you' il get through this , bill .
as far as your family' s concerned , uh , i wouldn' t say anything .
you' il ruin the great start we had last night .
hmm .
it felt as if i was being treated like a person .
yes , joe this , joe that .
a nice smile .
quince passed me the rolls .
no passion or rapture or any of these mighty things you' re so intent on imparting .
but i am certain , should you say who i am , our adventure would end abruptly .
mm hmm .
and i did so enjoy your family .
what about my family ?
this adventure involves only me , right ?
what do you mean ?
i' il tell you what .
you promise this undertaking of yours ... involves only me and , uh ...
and what ?
i won' t tell anyone who you are .
sounds fair enough .
good .
is it a deal ?
a deal ?
yeah .
you give your word ; i give mine that we' il do what we say .
mm hmm .
it is a truth exchanged between two people .
bill ?
what ?
you have a deal .
ow !
that' s great .
great .
you know , i got to thinking .
with you here and seemingly occupied , how' s your work going , i mean , elsewhere ?
while you were shaving this morning , you weren' t just shaving .
what do you mean ?
you were hatching ideas , making plans , arriving at decisions , right ?
yeah , i guess so .
so you understand the concept .
while part of you is busy doing one thing , another part of you is doing another , perhaps even attending to the problems of your work .
correct ?
of course .
so you understand the idea .
congratulations , bill .
now multiply that by infinity , take that to the depths of forever , and you still will barely have a glimpse of what i' m talking about .
joe ?
yes , bill ?
how about giving a guy a break ?
make an exception ?
well , there' s one to every rule .
not this .
and call my family .
i' d like them to have dinner with me tonight .
didn' t the family get together last night ?
jennifer .
of course , mr. parrish , right away .
uh , perhaps you' d like to wait in my office .
no .
what i' m trying to say is this is a board meeting and you' re not a member .
i' m sure you' il find a way to make it all right .
nice to meet you .
morning .
good morning .
thank you .
eddie .
uh , this is joe black .
he' s a personal associate of mine , and , uh ...
hello , quince .
hey .
he' il be joining us this morning .
i know this is unusual , and my apologies , and , uh ...
drew , carry on .
it' s nice to see you .
didn' t expect you , but , uh ... certainly you can' t get enough of a good thing .
thank you .
joe , would you like to sit there ?
okay .
uh , the board of parrish communications is hereby called to order .
our sole order of ...
our s ...
our sole order of business today is a , uh ... is an acceptance of john bontecou' s generous offer .
and i think bill ...
do you have any more of these delicious cookies ?
the jelly ones ?
mmm , and a cup of tea .
with milk , i think .
i' d like to try it english style .
yes .
a cup of tea with milk , please .
is there anything else , mr. black ?
how about some water ?
why , yes , thank you .
hot or cold ?
cold .
and a glass ?
mmm .
uh , to review .
we' re really crossing the t' s and dotting the i' s here .
uh , bill had a great and conclusive meeting yesterday with john bontecou , and all that remains for us is to put it to a vote .
um , thank you .
drew , um ...
yeah .
i did enjoy , or rather i was interested ... in meeting john bontecou yesterday , and , um ...
impressive , i suppose .
but , uh ...
but ...
it did get me to thinking .
see , i started in this business because this is what i wanted to do .
i knew i wasn' t gonna write the great american novel .
but i also knew there was more to life than buying something for a dollar ... and selling it for two .
i' d hoped to create something , something which could be ...
and what i realized was i ...
i wanted to give the news to the world .
and i wanted to give it unvarnished .
the more we all know about each other , the greater the chance we will survive .
sure , i want to make a profit .
you can' t exist without one , but , uh ...
john bontecou is all profit .
if we give him license to absorb parrish communications ... and he has his eye on a few others after us ... in order to reach the world , you will have to go through john bontecou .
and not only will you have to pay him to do this , far more important , you' il have to agree with him .
reporting the news is a privilege and a responsibility .
and it is not exploitable .
parrish communications has earned this privilege .
john bontecou wants to buy it .
as your chairman ,
i urge you to agree .
this company is not for sale .
it sounds like you' re not leaving much room for discussion .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
i know .
i' m sorry , i ...
looks like i' m reversing my field .
that' s your privilege , bill .
but given our needs , given the absolute necessity for growth , given the future , the truth is , joining john bontecou is every bit as certain as death and taxes .
death and taxes ?
yes .
death and taxes ?
yes .
what an odd pairing .
it' s just a saying , mr. black .
mmm .
by whom ?
doesn' t matter .
then why' d you bring it up ?
you' re not familiar with the phrase , " in this world , nothing is certain but death and taxes " ?
well , i am now .
glad i could be of some help .
i keep regular office hours if there' s any further information you might need ... on sayings , common phrases , manners of speaking .
my door' s wide open .
the tea i can provide , perhaps even the milk .
low fat .
yeah , okay , well , uh ...
i think we' ve accomplished everything we' re going to this morning .
shall we adjourn ?
but the matter is still on the table , bill .
joe ?
yes .
thank you for the delicious cookies .
mmm .
who is that guy ?
so ... what' s the deal here ?
you gonna be breathing down my neck right till the very end ?
i don' t understand .
i' d like to be alone for a while .
are you sad , bill ?
yes , i am .
why don' t you take a walk or something , get some air ?
i know i' il be seeing you .
of course .
good .
now i' d like to be alone .
this will hold you for a while .
you know about money , don' t you ?
it can' t buy happiness ?
yeah .
uh , jennifer ?
give mr. black a map of the city , would you ?
it' s okay , bill .
i can manage .
hi .
hi .
i need a medical record number for labs .
uh huh .
and , uh , will you try calling her husband ?
the number' s on top .
also , can you page me when c. t. ' s ready ?
oh , sure .
thanks , sweetie .
how nice you look .
is that your uniform ?
what are you doing here ?
are you ill ?
oh , goodness , no .
then why are you here , joe ?
i' m here to see you .
joe , i don' t ...
i don' t have time to see you right now .
i' m , um , about to start making rounds , and i' m examining back to back patients until dinner , and , uh ...
very well .
i' il watch .
watch me do what ?
make rounds and examine back to back patients .
joe , that' s impossible .
i' m a doctor .
and i' il be a visitor .
patients have visitors , not doctors .
i don' t mind .
miss ?
miss ?
doctor .
oh , um , just one second .
i' il be right there .
please .

okay .

i' il be right there .
come now , mama .
she' s in a great deal of pain .
yes .
have you spent much time in the islands ?
some .
i realize now my being here , uh , is not quite appropriate .
oh , no , please ...
please don' t apologize .
yes ?
yeah .
i' m glad that you came .
thank you , susan .
i' m very happy to be here .
joe , i' m with drew .
not now .
i have to go .
i' m sorry to say .
be sorry for nothing .
right .
thanks , joe .
good bye , susan .
good ?
mmm .
yes , what is it ?
cold lamb sandwich with cilantro .
a little coleman' s mustard .
it' s , uh , splendid .
glad you like it .
my wife turned me on to cold lamb sandwiches .
joan ... was my wife .
mm hmm .
yeah .
cold lamb sandwiches .
not as chewy as roast beef , not as boring as chicken .
she knew stuff like that .
everything reminds me of her .
there isn' t a day goes by that i don' t think about her .
one day she didn' t feel well .
the next day she was gone .
so what are you gonna do ?
yeah .
i guess you' ve heard all this a trillion times before , huh ?
more .
why didn' t you stop me ?
i don' t know .
what was it like when you first met ?
i thought you' d heard it a trillion times before .
this part i' m interested in .
well , she had on this little blue suit ...
with a little white collar that had a little ... red piping on it .
yeah ?
hi .
am i interrupting ?
yes .
no .
just kidding ?
sit down , drew .
uh , before i do , i was hoping we might be alone , bill .
well , joe and i have no secrets from each other .
how nice for you both .
pardon my candor , but i was confounded by your decision this morning .
why ?
i was hired .
you told me to help bring parrish communications into the 21st century .
this merger is the vehicle .
in my estimation ...
perhaps a merger is a way ... to bring bill' s company into the 21st century , and perhaps it isn' t .
and perhaps cheating on your french philosophers exam at the groton school ... was an expedient way to get your diploma , and perhaps it wasn' t .
be that as it may , drew , a question can often be argued both ways .
joe , cut it out .
you too , drew .
i thought this was practically a done deal .
well , now it' s undone , okay ?
forget bontecou .
scrub him .
i' m tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer .
i' m not going for it .
okay .
bill , why at this juncture ... are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters ?
' cause i don' t want anybody buying up my life' s work !
turning it into something it wasn' t meant to be .
a man wants to leave something behind .
he wants it left behind the way he made it .
he wants it to be run the way he ran it , with a sense of honor , of dedication , of truth .
easy , bill .
you' il give yourself a heart attack ... and ruin my vacation .
now listen .
i read you all the way on the bontecou thing , and i know where you' re coming from , and i am with you 101 percent .
well , thank you , quince .
but i just gotta tell you , if mergers are in the wind ,
i' ve developed some great prospects .
and i want to come and talk to you about ... about ' em next week .
next week ?
yeah .
or the week after .
no good ?
no .
why , anything' s possible .
it' s up to joe .
joe .
you just don' t know how glad i am you' re aboard , because anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man ,
i am ...
i' m in his corner .
that' s very gracious of you , quince .
ah , it' s no problem .
well , i' il leave you two alone , because i can , uh ...
i can tell , you know ... you got something in the fire .
now , look , i know you' re down .
but you know , when you' re down , there' s no place to go but up .
up .
thanks , quince .
forget about bontecou .
i got a couple other merger possibilities up my sleeve , and i' m pitching ' em to the old man .
were you ?
yeah .
hey , listen .
mm hmm .
we' re gonna go in together .
i' il clue you in .
the timing has gotta be right , because the old man says it' s up to joe .
he said it' s up to joe ?
mm hmm .
those were his words ?
yeah .
it' s up to joe , huh ?
yeah .
that' s what he said ?
that' s what he ...
that' s what he said .
that' s very interesting .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
i thought so too .
i want to thank you all for coming .
uh , my family , um , allison and quince ,
susan and the other members .
and , uh ...
so glad when we can get together .
i mean , i know you all have busy lives .
look who' s talking .
yeah .
speak for yourself .
yeah .
i remember when you were little girls , and , uh ...
i love little girls .
and uh , now you' re all grown up , and i , um ...
i had some words prepared , but , uh ,
i' ve forgotten them .
um ...
wait a minute , uh ...
there' s so much i wanted to say , uh ...
daddy ?
you could sit down if you want to .
yeah .
so many words i wanted to ...
so much i wanted to say , but , uh ...
i can' t , and so , uh ...
yeah , i better sit down .
carry on , everybody , please .
oh , one other thing .
um , why don' t we all ... have dinner again tomorrow night , okay ?
dinner again ?
yeah .
you haven' t had enough of us yet , dad ?
mmm ... mmm ... no .
come here .
we' il be here .
you bet we' il be here .
bright eyed and bushy tailed .
joe .
oh , no .
i would prefer some peanut butter .
how would you like that , sir ?
on some kind of toast ?
toast .
no , just the butter .
right away , sir .
why do you like peanut butter so much ?
i don' t know .
hmm .
i adore things like that .
food i can' t do without .
don' t you ?
yes .
it comforts you , doesn' t it ?
yes , i find that it does .
mind if i throw up ?
drew .
please .
i' m very concerned about the woman you attended to today .
i am too .
has her pain abated ?
we' re doing what we can for her , but , uh , it' s not looking very good .
i' m sorry to hear that .
yeah .
who are we talking about ?
but i know she' s grateful for the care you' re giving her .
is this a state secret ?
no , we' re talking about a patient of mine , ' cause ...
uh huh .
joe stopped by the hospital today .
he did ?
that' s more than we get to do .
maybe next time you go to the hospital , you' il take us along with you .
perhaps you could remind me .
well , i' il make a note of it .
anything else i can do for you ?
i wanna come along too .
see susie strut her stuff .
you' re on , quincie .
destination , hospital .
joe , you can be the tour guide , okay ?
susan' s a wonderful doctor .
i' m sure she is .
bill ?
yeah ?
i have to go .
it' s been a hell of a day .
i need a few minutes to sort everything out .
see you tomorrow .
joe ?
yes , bill ?
um ...
why' d you go to the hospital ?
i don' t know .
you just curious ?
i guess .
about susan ?
i wouldn' t put it that way .
how would you put it ?
you tell me , bill .
no , how about you telling me ?
i ask a simple question ; i expect a straight answer .
that' s what i' m used to .
anybody who doesn' t give it to me , i fire .
are you going to fire me , bill ?
drew ?
so , uh , i' il see you tomorrow night ?
you include me out .
i' ve had enough of the convocations .
you don' t mean that .
you don' t want to disappoint dad .
daddy will do fine .
besides , he' s got joe .
and it seems you do too .
you' re out of line .
well , that may be , but i don' t like the ubiquitous creep .
i don' t like the way he looks at you .
i don' t like the way he talks to you .
and vice versa .
i' m sorry .
' cause i like the way he looks and talks to me .
and vice versa .
okay ?
not okay .
thought we had a good thing going here .
i thought it was a good thing .
well , that just goes to show you never know .
night .
good night .
how long have you been standing there ?
i don' t like the way he spoke to you .
but i feel better now because of the way you spoke back .
tell me about yourself , joe .
i mean , who are you ?
what are you doing here with my father ?
you' re not going to tell me ?
you' re married , aren' t you ?
why ?
because men who never say anything about themselves , they' re ... they' re always married .
so you' re married ?
no , i' m not .
but you ... you have a girlfriend .
no .
gay ?
no .
so , tell me , joe ...
how come a man as attractive , intelligent , well spoken ...
diffident in the most seductive way , and yet ... powerful ... is all alone in this world ?
i' m sorry .
i' m s ...
i didn' t ... mean to pry , and , uh , you obviously don' t want to tell me , so we' il just ...
we' il just leave it a mystery .
that is the way you want it , isn' t it ?
yes , thank you .
where are you going ?
to bed .
to bed ?
yes .
i' m tired .
good night , daddy .
good night .
sleep well .
okay .
see you tomorrow .
good night .
see you .
good night , susie .
get some sleep .
good night .
yeah .
see you tomorrow .
good night .
good night .
that was wonderful .
mmm .
it' s good to get together .
mm hmm .
do you mind if i raise a little caution flag ?
raise away .
what is the nature of your interest in joe ?
well ...
remember how you told me about lightning striking ?
mm hmm .
the nature of it' s in there somewhere .
yeah .
well , i won' t say you' re on the wrong track , but , uh ...
then what will you say ?
i don' t think this is the lightning you' re looking for .
i mean , drew is a good man .
i know i didn' t seem to be completely in his corner before , but , uh , i' ve come to appreciate that , um ...
now we love drew ?
and joe doesn' t measure up ?
what' s going on ?
nothing .
when you say " nothing " that way , it is not nothing .
then what is it ?
it' s something .
okay .
good night .
i' il see you tomorrow .
yeah .
good night .
i know you' re all as uncomfortable as i am to be meeting like this .
but i got a call last night from john bontecou .
not only is he still interested , he' s sweetening his offer .
although it pains me to say it , in my opinion ,
bill parrish dealt with us preemptively ... in dismissing any deal with bontecou .
therefore , i' m sorry to say that if we' re to examine this new offer responsibly , as the board of directors of parrish communications , we must do so without its chairman .
there' s one additional element .
bontecou is so anxious to get us , he said he' d take parrish communications with bill parrish or without .
in this crisis , and be assured ... this is a crisis , it' s not pleasant to say the following .
but i would be remiss if i did not .
when we present bill with the improved bontecou offer , and if he still refuses to let us consider it , once more makes an adamant or emotional rejection , we will have no choice but to ...
you' re taking this too far , drew .
am i not obligated to ?
see if quince is here .
how did all this come about ?
crisis , bill parrish .
crisis , his company .
crisis for us .
it came about with the arrival on the scene of mr. joe black .
mr. joe who ?
joe black .
he attends our board meetings .
he sleeps at bill' s house .
he resides in his office .
he never leaves his side , and , in my opinion , is always in his ear , telling bill what to do .
and bill is listening .
who is joe black ?
what ...
what is his relationship to bill parrish , and most important , what is behind his influence on our chairman ?
he' s had advisors before .
nobody tells bill what to do .
thanks for coming , quince .
sure .
hi , ed .
hi , folks .
i didn' t know everybody was going to be here .
nice surprise .
what' s with the new digs ?
drew' s idea of cloak and dagger .
this is a secret meeting , quince .
i hope you' il respect its nature .
have a seat , quince .
now , what we' re trying to do here is to , uh ... to gather our thoughts in light of bill' s rejection of bontecou' s offer ... and to make an appropriate presentation to him ... as to how we think the company might proceed .
won' t you share with our board the information you gave me last night ?
well , uh , i' m hap ...
i' m happy to tell you i got good news .
as i was , uh , as i was telling drew , uh , i' ve been making a little hay while the bontecou sun was shining .
two , possibly three , new and boiling hot prospects for merger .
mm hmm .
and how did bill react to the leads you' ve developed ?
he was interested .
yeah , but he was concerned about the timing ?
timing ?
yeah , he was concerned about the timing ?
yes .
he says it' s up to joe .
it' s up to joe .
