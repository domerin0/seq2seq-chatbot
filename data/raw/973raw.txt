work harder !
keep on !
cut !
wake up !
even extras are actors .
we' re not making a ghost film now .
though you guys play the roles of pedestrians , but your roles still have life an soul .
especially we' ve chance to act with the kungfu actress queen cuckoo tu ... so we should grasp this chance .
act smartly , ok ?

i' m an actor .
aunt ha !
yes .
who is this guy ?
an extra .
i' m an actor .
are you mistaken ?
how can you let him touch my machine ?
sorry , brother sunny , i just went to toilet . so i asked him to do the rehearsal .
find someone who knows how to act , we need one urgently .
let me do it .
you ?
show me the expression of " nervous " .
there' re several kinds of nervous expression .
the one on the face of a husband whose wife is delivering a baby .
the baby is given birth .
but the wife is dead .
the baby calls him dad , he' s a genius .
his dick is on his head , he' s abnormal .
he wins mark six ... first prize !
his son is dead ...
his wife comes back to life .
his wife comes back to life .
no more response , if one is struck too hard emotionally ... he will enter a state of mental coma , he' il show no response .
is there another guy ?
aunt ha , what have i done wrong ?
i don' t know what you were doing .
was there anything wrong with my expression ?
i' ve said i didn' t know what you were doing .
aunt ha , none of your extras is smart enough .

brother sunny ?
what is your extra up to ?
how come you are still alive ?
as i said i' d play my role with a bit naughtiness .
so subconsciously i don' t want to die yet .
you must pretend to be dead .
actually , i was dying .
if you give me a bit more time , i' il die eventually .
do you know how many frames of film are there in one second ?
24 frames , sister cuckoo .
do you know how long is the shot just then ?
i guess it about one minute .
do you know as you didn' t want to die ... that you' ve wasted how many seconds , how many frames and how much money and how much time and effort of everyone here ?
are you fooling around here ?
i' m begging you , you' d better find a professional extra for this role .
get someone smarter and shoot again !
you' d better be smart !
go home and think about when exactly you want to die .
ok , brother sunny .
aunt ha , what have i done wrong ?
don' t ask me again , i really don' t know what you were doing .
then i ...
get lost .
you remind me i must go to a meeting of neighbour welfare association .
i' il be right back .
you don' t have to come back .
i' m begging you , stop making trouble .

director , what kind of performance ?
you are shot to dead , ready .

was it ok , director ?
this is it , go and change your clothes .

unit manager , i want to get a lunch box only .

the play " thunder storm " is adapted from a well known chinese classic literature .
you guys all know it well .
tomorrow , i' il be leading actor , you guys want to see it , right ?
so , i' il see you guys tomorrow then .
kelly , is there anything to do after dinner tomorrow ?
taking a dump .
come and watch uncle san' s play after taking a dump , it' il be fun .
remember to bring your dad and mom too .
if they don' t come , you can cry , spit around .
do whatever you can until they come , then you' il be a good girl .
i pamper you , kelly .
kelly , if i don' t see you tomorrow .
you' il result like this doll .

uncle chi , the play " thunder storm " will be on show tomorrow night .
have you studied the script well ?
yes , don' t worry .
i can even compose a song .
old master sings whenever he sees the maid .
you' re beautiful ...
uncle chi , i' m the one who sing the theme song .
and the role of " old master " you play is a chinese as well .
when the maid sees the old master , she will sing ...
you' re so handsome , you' re so smart ...
thank you much , please to ...
uncle chi , please don' t ...
i accept you ...
are you ok ?
think positive , uncle chi .
someone helps me , come on .
master hung , morning .
my play " thunder storm " will soon be showing .
shall we make another rehearsal ?
do i need to rehearsal ?
thunder storm " is about righteous , i knew it .
we' re triad society member , we only talk about two things .
first , about righteous , second , about money .
i' il talk about righteous first .
righteous " is good , but we mustn' t ignore the love line of the story .
because the role you play will finally be struck to death .
talking about " struck " , let me tell you ...
there are two kinds of " struck " in our world .
first , it is " dragging " .
second is " stabbing " .
look , this scar was dragged by knife .
while " stabbing " is like this .
this scoundrel is new comer , sorry , he shows no expression .
stabbing " is like this .
be serious , let us know if you feel the pain , ok ?
your acting is lousy .
brother sau , teaching him for me .
talking about " pain " ... according to stanisslavski , master of acting from russia .
pain is transmitted from your body to the inside , and outside again .
let try one more time .
look , it' s much better this time .
isn' t it ?
he acts much better now .
let' s try one more time .
right , a little bit more , more , being stabbed .
maybe i can help you this way .
this is working , tears come out now .
look clearly , remember this expression , remember this feeling .
do remember this , get it ?
let' s go .
what about own " thunder storm " tomorrow .
no rehearsal needed for " thunder storm " .
we will come for sure , promise is a promise !
i' il bring hundreds of people to watch your play as well .
it' s a deal .
just don' t worry .
faster .
get into position .
granny , you stepped on someone .
i didn' t step on anyone .
you just couldn' t feel when you stepped on him , look at his foot .
yes , he' s sweating as well .
give me some money and i' il send him to the hospital .
i have no money .
look at him , he' s dying .
i only have $100 left .

let' s move !
granny , you' ve dropped some money .

it' s your luck , uncle .
let' s play ' chai fist ' ?
i don' t know how to play it .
you don' t know ' chai fist ' ?
have you been educated ?
fanny , come here .
your belly is really big !

cheer up , why did draw your face ?
your parents are dead or something ?
chai fist ' , bingo !
triangle , rectangle , four !
good , i' il drink !
tonight is college girls ' first love evening .
so please mind your words , do behave like a student girl .
if clients complain about you again , then i can' t help you anymore .
what college girl ?
just a damned trick .
if i can be a college girl , i won' t be working here .
you believe you did nothing wrong ?
mamasan , the man at table 7 is really ugly .
i can' t stand it and i am not doing business with him .
do you all want to be selecting on clients ?
no ...
you' re too much .
you are not professional , you can concentrate on one single .
one single spot ?
if that man is ugly , you needn' t look at him .
if his ears are pretty , just stare at his ears .
if his mouth is ugly but the teeth are nice , just look at his teeth .
so you new comer are really ignorant .
let me deal with him .
come on , watch what i' il do .
be smart .
hi !
you' re pretty .
what' s your name , boss ?
my name is pierre .
it' s a french name .
are everyone says i look like a frenchman , so i get a french name .
if you can' t pronounce that well , just call me pi or erre .
what' s on ?
you used to be proud , now you get a lesson .
you can' t blame me , he' s a real rarity .
have you seen anyone put a cockroach on his head ?
what' s the problem ?
look at lulu , she' s playing with that cockroach now .
i admit failure .
ok , from now on , you won' t have clients to sit at .
you' il be bored to death .
you' re all like this .
connie , come and teach her for me .
you' re not amateur , you should know you must act in front of clients .
but your problem is : you acting stinks .
i can do nothing about it .
i hear someone teaches acting for free .
i' il take you to see him .
teaches acting ?
hey , men .
yes !
hurry up , start working .
you again ?
morning , brother sunny .
aunt ha !
i' m looking for him too .
i haven' t given you a notice , what brings you here ?
remember last time that you asked me to think about the ways to die .
i' ve thought over and i have some new ideas now , and i believe my performance will make you satisfied .
i would have killed you in the past .
talking about knife , it' s different from a gun .
the position of the wound is usually under the armpit , here .
the wound is a bit bigger , and the face will twist more .
if you' re betrayed by your own friends , you will even ...
i didn' t expect ... it' s you ...
get lost !
brother sunny , i ...
i just want to act , give me a chance please .
do you love standing here ?
ok , stand here , i won' t pay you a dime .
i' il act even if you don' t pay me , i only want a lunch box .
but lunch box costs money too , beat it !
sunny .
what is it , martial art director ?
it' s bad to use this mannequin to disguise as a dead man .
figure it out , we' re in a hurry !
yes , ok ... got it .
thank you , brother sunny .
only a lunch box .
no problem , should i put some make up on ?
put it on now .
director , the actors are ready .
actors are all ready .

cockroach ...
let' s help sister cuckoo .
cockroach !
go to hell !
sister cuckoo , don' t be afraid .
sister cuckoo , don' t be afraid , it' s ok now .
director , can we cut now ?
it' s still running ?
cut !
ok .
are you ok ?
must you do all these to kill a cockroach !
let' s see if he' s alright ?
i' m fine , sister cuckoo , thanks for your concerns .
why don' t you move at all ?
i didn' t move since director hasn' t shouted ' cut ' yet .
so i mustn' t move .
do you hear that ...
he keeps on acting since the director hasn' t shouted ' cut ' yet .
this is what i always tell you : professionalism .
what' s your name ?
i' m called wan tin sau .
yee , give him a cup of coffee .
yes .
get his phone number for me .
yes .
you ... work in my team from now on .
thanks , sister cuckoo .
is this shot ok ?
yes .
weapon comes .
sunny .
yes .
i am telling you , even extras are important .
the one who played the father , we mustn' t use him again .
got it , sister cuckoo .
sister cuckoo , i am the one who played the father .
in fact , it is like this ...
fine ...
let me clean it for you , towel , get the towel .
sister cuckoo !
watch out !
sister cuckoo , are you alright ?
don' t touch .
don' t touch !
very pretty .
sister cuckoo !
security guard , is there someone here who teaches acting ?
i' ve been in the field of art for ages .
whether it' s movie or tv , i' m experienced .
i was the creative director in amusement park theatre .
so i can sing and dance .
you mean you are the instructor here ?
well , many people here love theatre and play .
they love studying plays with me .
those people introduce us here indeed .
ok , this way please .
it' s you ?
didn' t you play in that film ... that ...
the stupid man standing behind , falls after stepping on a banana peel ?
you noticed my performance too ?
you idiot !
only an idiot will fall after stepping on a banana peel .
why don' t you go dying ?
thanks .
are you really that stupid ?
you' re flattering me .
you damned extra , you are ...
in fact , i am an actor .
that way please .
damned extra .
what can i do for you ?
frankly , we' re hostesses of a night club .
i can tell .
we' re holding " college girls ' first love evening " right now .
these girls dare to say they don' t have the feeling of first love at all .
how can you work like this ?
first love was shown at the stage when we where babies .
say , when a baby sees a comforter , he wants to suck it .
this is a kind of love .
why did you suck a comforter ?
you damned extra .
in fact , i am an actor .
well , so why did you talk about sucking a comforter ?
i' m going to explain everything to you .
ok , let' s explain it .
i love you , i hate you , etc .
it' il be more impressive if you have some tears in your eyes .
just like this .
do you see ?
that teardrop ...
good , the teardrop is inside the eyes .
where is the teardrop ?
you damned extra .
in fact , i am an actor .
you might need something to help you since you' ve no experience , and the simplest way is to eat wasabi .
wasabi ?
what are you talking about ?
must we be fooled by this damned extra ?
miss , if you must call me an extra , you don' t need to add ' damned ' in front of it .
in fact , being club girls ...
if you can show some respect to the others , then ...
what are you calling us ?
excuse me .
forget it , we are club girls indeed .
i just don' t like him calling me that way .
she' s always like this , never mind her .
it' s ok ...
i' ve asked you not to stir up trouble !
it' s ok ...
it' s ok ...
why must you still behave like this ?
don' t panic , it' s alright .
don' t panic , it' s alright .
club girls ?
it' s alright ... don' t panic , take it easy , it' s alright .
how could i know he' s so amusing ?
i brought you there as i thought he charged for nothing .
if you hadn' t block my way , i' d have ...
please , beware what you say to the clients .
go out ...
i' m sorry .
what' s going on ?
this is a big night club .
get lost , i' m sorry .
are there other hostesses ?
yes , they' re coming soon .
connie , come here .
what is it , mama debra ?
master lung is here and he' s drunk .
he thought he' s being dumped and he wants his first lover back .
all the girls here are college girls , they' il suit him .
look , he has scanned almost all my girls .
but none of them suits his taste , he' s nuts .
look at his money , it' s piled up .
have you gone inside ?
not yet .
wait here for a while .
go and send some more girls here .
i have so much money .
come and get it if you can .
i want my first lover .
first lover !
you wanna try ?
i' il give it a shot , sometimes it' s hard to tell the taste of a rich man .
get lost .
hurry up , be smart .
master lung , here come the beauties .
say hi to master lung .
boss .
get lost !
master lung , don' t get mad .
go away !
none of them is pretty !
they are not sincere , i want my first lover !
first lover ...
they' re all here for money !
i am sincere .
i really love you .
mary , i' il give you anything you want .
i can give you all the money on the table ... as long as you don' t leave me , mary .
what is it ?
are you alright ?
i' ve hit you hard , sorry .
if that table wasn' t there and i could kick you ,
i wouldn' t have been defeated by you .
i' m not here to fight with you , i' m here to learn acting from you .
go away .
to some honest friends who have the same interest as i do .
i' il be more than willing to teach them .
just a second .
i' m coming , 1 , 2 , 2 and a half , 3 .
must it take you so long for make up ?
you damned ...
don' t again !
your tie is high classed .
thanks .
since i' ve taken your money , i should act accordingly .
where' s the ping pong racket ?
under the table .
there' re many people here , let' s go over there .
i' m wan tin sau , and you ?
lau piu piu .
what do you want to learn ?
how to pamper those bastards in the night club .
the first love feeling of college girls must be built from the base .
you can take me as your client , and greet me first .
boss , want some fist games ?
don' t call me " boss " , you' re college girl now .
you can say good morning , or morning , sir .
good morning , sir .
try to lower your head a little bit , pretend to be shy .
let your client touches your chin and raise your head and then say .
morning , sir .
your regards are bad , again .
give me glistened regards .
morning , sir .
too glistened now , i' il faint , again .
take it easy .
morning , sir .
these are eyes of dead body , you' il scare others to death .
again .
be natural .
morning , sir .
good !
now let' s discuss about your action , say , hugging .
hug me with your way .
what for ?
what for ?
you needn' t lock others with your thigh every time .
sorry , my job requires this .
you must stop doing that .
being a college girl , you needn' t always take initiation .
you can act shyly so that men will hug you .
what do you mean by shy ?
like this .
like biting a quail ?
act on .
right , when men see you biting a quail , they' il naturally hold and hug you .
now you can put your head on their shoulders .
what for ?
excuse me , my job requires this .
you must stop doing that !
superficially it' s all .
if we go further , i must then ask you about your first love .
i never have first love .
everyone has first love .
i said i never have one .
you must have some unforgettable memory .
no .
or you must have heard someone say something you can never forget .
never !
i hope i can be with you forever .
promise me , let me take care of you for the rest of your life .
then you must have unforgettable experience .
never !
being club girl ?
didn' t say you' il take care of me ?
how come i have money if you don' t work as club girl ?
how can i take care of you if i have no money ?
now , imagine i' m your first boyfriend lover .
sau , on the night of your play , i was engaged in a transaction .
so i was too busy to come , sorry .
was there good response ?
sure .
it' s good then .
i will surely come next time .
someone' re shooing kids karaoke , you aren' t one of them ?
i' ve things to see you , excuse me .
take me new boy to collect protection money for me .
help me improve his appearance ...
about the way he speaks ?
right , that' s it , you won' t refuse my request , right ?
thanks for teaching me .
over there .
being a triad member ... you must have a unique appearance .
it' s right you have a gold chain with you .
you must try to look furious and severe .
try it .
more furious .
show some anger .
wrath .
throw that nibble away .

director , i put them here intentionally .
there' re pigeons here in our last shot .
if the pigeons fly , they' il stir up the fire .

director ...
the mood of this shot will be better if the pigeons are there .
how much better ?
it' s hard to say , it' s something abstract .
anyway , the mood will be better .
put them up and let' s see the effect .
that stunt man mustn' t turn his head !
director , how do you like it ?
it' s a bit better .
