oh , magoo , you' ve done it again .

good night , mrs wonderbottom .
ugliest hairdo i' ve ever seen .

aha !
express elevator .
elevator with a view !
now that' s what i call an express .
good godfrey !
earthquake !
don' t panic , everyone .
we' ve got enough canned food here to cover any emergency .
that' s better .
carry on , boys .
parking lot .
mm hmm .
whoopsie .
by george , somebody fix the lights ... before anyone trips .
the escalator to the parking lot .
such sophistication !
good night , henry .
good night .
right turn only .
road hog !
blasted potholes !
the checkered flag ?
magoo , you , you speed demon , you !
you' ve still got it .
el nino' s back .
oh , magoo , you' ve done it again .
and tonight , quincy magoo , the canned vegetable king ... will dedicate the new museum wing he has donated to the city .
the magoo rotunda will house a travelling exhibit ... of the treasures of kuristan ... including the rarest of all rubies , the star of kuristan .
treat her gently , young fella .
check underneath .
i think there' s something rattling there .
yes , you dropped the keys , my boy .
it' s the most precious ruby in the world .
lovely .
it' s just gorgeous .
it' s exquisite .
exquisite .
no .
actually it' s corundum .
that' s an aluminum oxide .
okay , don' t take my word for it .
exquisite is an adjective , not an element .
all right .
if you' re so smart , how come mr cloquet told me ... to watch you like a hawk ?
cloquet said that ?
why is it that someone always seems to burn the rumaki ?
maybe you should see another eye doctor .
waldo , hiram has been my optometrist since i was a small boy in knee pants .
he' s like 2, 000 years old .
all his other patients are dead .
you can' t hold that against him .
but he' s still making appointments with them .
trust me , you need a second opinion .
oh , my gosh !
would you , would you look at that !
what ?
wait , don' t look .
don' t look .
what ?
she' s coming this way .
mr magoo ?
i am stacey sampanahoditra of the kuristani foreign office .
oh .
this is my nephew waldo .
waldo magoo .
it is an honour .
oh .
uh , you' il have to forgive him sometimes .
he gets like that , lost in thought .
quite a scholar , you know .
graduated with a large class .
isn' t that right , waldo ?
waldo ?
waldo !
yeah .
l i , i w went there to college .
oh .
uh , waldo , why don' t you invite , uh , stacey to our opera tomorrow night ?
i would be most honoured , sir .
stacey ... will you join us for the opera tomorrow night ?
it' s a , uh , benefit performance .
uh , we' re doing excerpts from the norsemen saga .
i look forward to it .
please excuse me .
i must greet diplomats .
that' s a very attractive young lady .
but i' m , i' m such a fool .
l i tried to offer her a snack .
oh , waldo , don' t be so hard on yourself .
cupid makes fools of us all .
and now , as curator of this museum ... it is my pleasure to present our benefactor ... a man of great vision , quincy magoo .
step right this way , sir .
ah , well , thank you , thank you .
ah , well , may , uh , may all of the exhibits in this hall ... chime with the light of human knowledge .
my dear , thank you .
thank you .
hey !
look out !
watch out !
oh , yes .
great scott !
what is this , indoor fireworks ?
what a wonderful touch .
excuse me .
or a blackout .
i should inform the power company here .
get that fixed , and get these lights back on .
hello down here .
public telephone .
oh , what ...
excuse me , sir .
we have an emergency ...
great scott !
we have an injured man here .
bandaged from head to foot .
help .
some assistance , please .
and whoever did it has stolen the telepho ...
god !
they gave me a bad mask .
okay .
go .
i gotta watch her like a hawk .
morgan !
you just , uh , you just hang on .
i' il get you some medical attention .
you stay right here .
no , you' re in no condition ...
oh , well .
how many times must i tell you ?
stay back in the booth , man .
i' il take care of him .
i' il be back .
i' il get some help or maybe find a telephone .
freeze !
drop the gun .
turn around .
yes , sure .
must be a phone out there somewhere .
well , if you can' t bring mohammed to the mountain ...
morning , angus .
avast , angus .
are you ready to cast off ?
waldo ?
what are you doing here ?
oh , just cleaning your windshield .
aha , my boy , you are a prince , but i have a date with a flounder .
anchors aweigh .
anchors aweigh .
oh , the windshield did need cleaning , huh ?
right , angus ?
i don' t think i' ve seen it this clear since 1956 .
well , now that you' re here , we' d better inform the police .
orders , u. s. state department .
this incident is to remain completely under wraps .
which includes the crazy 9 1 1 call about a bandaged man in the museum .
we substitute a replica of the jewel and ...
and we open the exhibit as if nothing has happened .
hold it .
who the hell are you ?
and who told the state department ?
i did .
they said they would send two of their very best operatives .
gustave anders , cla .
i' m in charge of this investigation .
chuck stupak , fbl , and i' m in charge of this investigation .
the cla has no jurisdiction on american soil .
this could very well become an international incident .
not if you don' t get in my way , fancy pants .
hmm ?
oh .
i don' t get it .
there' s nothing in the papers .
it' s a trap .
they' re trying to lull us into a false sense of security ... and then bust us when we make a careless move .
we' il never make it to cloquet' s .
they' re onto us , luanne .
i can feel it in my ...
morgan , that' s yesterday' s paper .
oh .
nothing like the old sea air to clean out the pipes .
huh ?
right , angus ?
the sun is a little hot .
time to apply the old ban de soleil .
there we go .
oh .
a very refreshing , minty fragrance .
ah , the french .
they think of everything .
what' s that ?
the old fog rolling in , thick as pea soup ?
not my pea soup , mind you , but maybe one of those other brands .
bob , why steal the star for your boss , cloquet , and get peanuts for it ... when he can turn around and auction it off for millions ?
why not auction it off ourselves ?
that way we get millions and each other .
me and you ?
i could take you to places you' ve never been before .
i' ve never been to toronto .
i know a little cosy bed and breakfast place in toronto ... but we could skip the breakfast part .
come on , angus .
we won' t let a little fog stop us , huh ?
you rotten seagulls !
you con sarned buzzards , you !
uncivilized behaviour .
i' d never do anything like that to you .
i' m gonna have to get this dry cleaned now .
blast your ...
ho ho ho .
i' ve got a strike .
well , shiver my timbers !
it' s a lunker !
just call me ishmael .
it' s moby dick !
why , look at that ...
look at ...
look at that , angus .
it' s huge .
he was a big one , angus .
just look at the size of those , uh , uh , pants .
well , i' d say we were in the bermuda triangle ... but we' re nowhere near bermuda .
i' il just play it safe and head for shore .
well , angus , here we are in safe harbour once again .
well , an escalator to the top .
how swank .
must be a yacht club .
angus ?
angus , where are you , boy ?
well , hello , angus .
come on there , fella .
we believe magoo created a diversion while his accomplices stole the jewel .
but why ?
mr magoo is a very wealthy man .
are you sure about that ?
people do eat a lot more fresh food these days .
okay , we don' t collar magoo .
we put him under surveillance .
but this is absurdity .
i' m to be his guest at the opera tonight .
great !
you can be our inside person .
that is , if it' s all right with the fbl .
so , magoo has the star of kuristan .
but it was luanne' s fault !
she double crossed us .
i shouldn' t have hired her .
but she' s the only one capable of stealing the star .
how could someone with such beauty ... be so treacherous ?
i worship all that is beautiful , morgan .
the greatest sin is to destroy a thing of beauty .
i fear now we must destroy the beautiful miss le seur .
kill her .
but first , get the stone , all right ?
tomorrow buyers are arriving from all over the world to bid on the ruby .
schmidt .
gosher .
havzinski .
i hear there' s a rumour ortega peru might even show .
the piranha ?
the king of the underworld ?
oh , morgan , don' t screw this up , hmm ?
i' m coming .
on my way !
hello , sir .
um , oh , stacey !
aren' t you a sight for sore eyes ?
i thought that waldo was going to pick you up , uh , on the way to the opera .
well , in my country , the invitee always picks up the inviter .
i' m sure that waldo would not have it any other way .
unc , i need to borrow a tie .
oh , hi , stacey .
hello , waldo .
uh , why don' t you , uh , show stacey the garden before you leave ?
it' s quiet and , uh , and peaceful ... and , uh , intimate .
i , l , i don' t think she' d want to see the ...
i' d love to see more of your charming home .
all right .
it' s , uh ...
it' s right back here .
the smell of rice is in the air .
love in bloom , if ever i' ve seen it before .
angus ?
come on , now .
how many times ... have i told you to stay out of that closet ?
come on in here , boy .
help me with my scales .
it' s my uncle' s work .
oh .
never have i seen such a plant sculpture .
topiary' s kind of a hobby of his .
and he specializes in the abstract .
oh , no .
that' s a bunny rabbit .
hey , well .
what ...
what is ...
what is that ?
oh .
so you want to play fetch again ?
is that it ?
ah , well , it' s a dog' s life .
here we go .
there it goes .
your uncle , do you think he needs glasses ?
oh , and how !
just don' t try and tell him that .
he will not spend the money ?
i notice he drives a very old car .
is his business not healthy ?
oh , no .
no .
he just loves that old car .
and if unc loves something , he won' t let it go .
angus !
stop terrorizing the squirrels .
stupak !
where are you ?
right behind you .
don' t turn around .
just spotted a conspicuous white male .
dirty clothes , needs a haircut .
sticks out like a sore thumb .

turn around .
don' t turn around .
walk backwards .

my jewel is luminous , sparkling .

your government thinks mr magoo stole the star of kuristan .

a lusty , busty charmer
please let me pierce your armour and together we' il find love
all right .
oh , no .

put me down .
here we go .
my ankle' s fine .
here we go .
ah .
well ... with a little more practise , i , uh , could pop the question .
quincy .
oh , your house is beautiful .
do you mind if i look around ?
look away .
look away .
i' il just put my hat in the closet here , and ...
may i make you a cocktail ?
ah , i' m famished .
do you think you could cook us something ?
something hot ?
can i cook ?
you may call me " cordon bleu " magoo .
uh , which way to the little girls ' room ?
ah , atop the stairs .
let me light your way .
ah , ah , your repast awaits you down here , my dove .
next i want you to put some water on to boil .
and while we' re waiting for that , let' s clean about , oh ... two or three sprigs of parsley .
water on to boil .
next , pat the chicken dry .
now , take some lemon and rub it on the chicken .
now , make sure you get the whole chicken .
lift the leg if you have to .
now , i hope you' re not cheating and using bottled lemon juice .
if you are , it just won' t taste as good .
why ?
well , no peel appeal .
angus , there you are , old friend .
well , i can' t play right now .
i don' t have any time .
and now , lift both legs high into the air .
left and right .
all right , then .
just one last time , then you take it upstairs .
all right .
come on , don' t be a slacker .
you can do it .
lift those legs !
left and right .
back and forth .
one , and two , and three , and four .
come on , you can do it .
lift both legs high into the air .
lift them left and right .
and left and right .
come on , you can do it .
lift those legs high into the air .
and dance !
come on .
get your rear into gear .
now , don' t stop until you' re ready to drop .
now you' re cookin ' !
go get some sandpaper , and sand that sucker smooth .
you don' t want any bumps on the surface .
i recommend a medium grade paper because ... if you use a sandpaper that' s too fine , you' re gonna be at it all day .
now , whatever you do , do not use a metal file ... because that will shred the surface to a pulp .
must be a chinese recipe to make the chicken tender .
either that , or it' s german .
use short , light strokes , and watch out for surface abrasions .
don' t rush it .
these things take time .
unc ?
i want him .
magoo is goin ' down !
you hear me ?
what ?
come on !
now ...
after you finish drilling , you want to make sure that you squirt some caulk into those holes .
unc .
there' s something very important we need to talk about .
waldo , waldo .
how did you know ?
i thought this was my little secret .
then it' s true !
yes , and a lot of people are in for a big surprise .
have you gone insane ?
yes !
yes , i ...
you have gone insane .
insane .
insane with passion .
prunella .
prunella ?
prunella .
oh , oh , oh , you' re talk ...
you' re talking ...
that' s wonderful , unc .
it' s time that you met this glorious thief ... who has stolen my heart .
uh , i' il be right back .
prunella !
prunella !
oh , my gosh !
he did do it .
aha !
there you are , my viking princess .
come .
i want you to meet someone .
not now .
i can' t wait any longer , quincy .
i' m gonna ask you once , and only once .
ah , you' re going to propose !
oh , my precious bonbon .
you read my mind .
you know what i came here for .
you know what i want .
give it to me .
ah , you modern women .
you' re so direct .
angus .

don' t worry , my boy .
we' il catch him on the turnaround .
hold on , angus !
hey , look out !
stop !
look out !
stop !
don' t panic , now .
we' re only in some kind of tunnel .
brakes !
brakes , unc !
unc , hit the brake !
great scott !
those speed bumps .
i tell ya .
i' il sue this city .
uh , prunella , uh , about the fbl .
you were saying ?
yeah , uh , uh , fbl .
i , i' m ...
i' m an undercover agent ... for the government .
does this mean no story in " the opera news " ?
i' m sorry i had to deceive you .
they think you stole the star of kuristan .
that' s what i' ve been trying to tell you .
what ?
they , they what ?
that burglar in your house was really a notorious jewel thief ... who works for a man named austin cloquet .
the bureau has learned that cloquet plans to sell the jewel ... tomorrow at a secret auction up at a ski lodge .
ortega peru , the piranha .
no one' s ever seen him .
he never goes anywhere .
so if we could get someone to impersonate peru ... we could get close to the gem and recover it .
but who ?
we lost him right here , and magoo didn' t return home all night .
why is he always one step ahead of me ?
kenyawa tambe just charged some tickets to a ski resort .
yeah , so what ?
kenyawa tambe is one of luanne' s aliases .
why didn' t you tell me this before ?
i just found out .
oh really ?
yeah .
you know , we' re supposed to be working as a team here .
you' re going around behind my back .
if the pressure' s too much for you ...
you' il take over !
you' il take over !
sirs !
i shall go with you .
no .
young lady , this is strictly a job for professionals .
then why are the two of you going ?
welcome to the rockies , gentlemen .
if you' il follow me to the limo , i' il take you to austin cloquet .
who the hell are you ?
ortega peru .
what' s it to you ?
mr peru never goes anywhere .
that' s right .
i never go anywhere .
so when i go somewhere , everyone thinks i am nowhere ... when i' m really there .
now , let' s put this show on the road .
uh , sorry .
mr peru , uh , this way .
there are no signs .
so you' ve been staking out my uncle all this time .
is that right ?
that' s my job .
and the way you say you feel about him , is , is that part of your job , too ?
you all right , boy ?
you saw this man ?
yeah .
he just went up the mountain .
said his name was ortega peru .
magoo is peru ?
magoo , the piranha .
this is big .
we' re gonna need some backup .
don' t you know how to open a door ?
gentlemen , thank you all for coming .
we' re especially honoured today to have with us mr ortega peru .

well , you' re too kind .
well , when you' ve changed your clothes , these lovely ladies ... are waiting to serve you with chilled champagne in the solarium .
thank you .

give it to me in my hand .
mr peru ?
your frog is leaking .
oh .
well .
gentlemen .

the star is mine !
prunella !
