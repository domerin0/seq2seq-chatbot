the dress is brand new .
ok then we' il try not to damage it .
are you sure it' s okay after all these years of friendship ?
we prepared the ground well , it' s time to build on it .

today it' s free .
it will be a pleasure .

hey are you a " taxi " , or a nice taxi ?
the driver is really nice .
he opens the door , doesn' t make you car sick , and doesn' t speak if not asked to .
and he carries the bags if asked nicely .
thank you , perfect .
and where are we going , miss ?
you see the pink house over there , with a big door ?
yes , i see it .
that' s where we' re going .
do you prefer a route in particular ?
put all that in the kitchen , i' il organise it later .
you have enough food for a week there .
oh no , my son is coming for lunch .
he eats all that in one meal ?
no .
sunday he prepares ... ... all his meals for the week ,
his apartment is so small there' s no kitchen .
and he can' t even cook an egg .
look .
that' s him in the picture .
he' s a computer geek .
he works at ibm .
everybody has their thing .
and you ?
what is your " thing " ?
i love driving , but you probably didn' t have time to see it !
my son is taking his driving exam for the 8th time .
8 times !
8 is my lucky number it will be good for him .
at the end of the street , we' re going to turn to the ... to the ... to the ... to the
to the left , mr. carbadec .
to the left , to the left !
to the left !
are you nuts ?
we' re going to crash !
jesus christ !
i' ve never seen such an idiot in the 10 years i' ve worked here !
can' t you tell right from left ?
yes but you should have told me sooner .
should i have sent a sax ?
left left !
it' s no so difficult to turn a steering wheel and press a pedal !
everyone has their strengths .
and you what is your job ?
where they hell do they hire idiots like that ?
in a circus , in a zoo , the government or what ?
a little bit of all three .
ah you should have said it earlier .
should i have sent a fax ?
excuse me .
can i offer you something , inspector ?
thank you , that' s great .
thanks you .
you' re so nice , i' m going to keep your card .
i don' t want to be rude but i need to go work , is it ok if i eat in the taxi ?
of course , go ahead .
go work !
can you save my life ?
in theory , no .
it depends on your symptoms .
i have a flight in 25 minutes .
if i miss it i' m a dead man .
if i catch it , you' re a rich man .
hmm ... the gentleman is lucky .
i' m no doctor , ... ... but i really like emergencies .
buckle up please ! .
maybe we should go now .
here we go .
a white taxi moving really fast !
he knocked down my radar !
we' il care of it got his plate number ?
i didn' t have the time it was too fast .
open your eyes , it' s your job .
do you think we' re going to make it on time ?
because if we' re going to miss it maybe we should take our time .
it' il be ok , we' re going slow now , but on the highway we' il speed up .
ah i see , i see .
don' t take all these risks for me !
i don' t want you to lose your license .
no problem , i don' t have a license .
fantastic .
14 minutes and 30 seconds .
leaves you time to read the paper and maybe a cup of coffee .
have a good trip , sir .
thank you .
i don' t understand .
on the computer i' m unbeatable .
first in monaco , 8 pole positions .
but on the streets i' m a disaster .
so ?
how did you do ?
i didn' t make it .
that' s impossible .
i know champagne is better with time ... ... but now it' s almost past the due date .
what happened ?
nothing , i just crashed into a butcher shop .
you know what ?
you should put a mouse in your car , instead of your steering wheel .
like the disabled .
what ?
come on ...
emilien , someone just set a new record .
a taxi , near the harbour .
you know how fast ?
140 ?
yeah , in first gear .
then he switched into 2nd ... 217 km/ h !
did they get him ?
yeah of course , they called in the air force .
imagine at that speed .
hey , have you heard this one ?
listen , it' s funny .
what' s the difference between a comb and a moron ?
ok you' re not listening .
i' il come back later .
yes .
much later , and if it' s at night , that' s even better .
next time , knock before you enter !
petra ...
i don' t mean that for you .
thanks , emilien .
so how did it go with your test , was it bad ?
ah , news travels fast .
i have news for you , the chief is having a meeting now , and only you are missing .
well , nobody told us you know !
all you have to do is push this button ...
you see there , it' s written " power " .
you hear me ?
i said in my office right now , are you deaf emilien ?
not anymore , boss .
after hitting banks in holland , italy and belgium ... the mercedes gang has arrived in france
and the germans must absolutely not invade our territory again .
my grandfather died in their hands , so it' s a personnal matter .
so the paris bonn liaison , german french friendship , can kiss my ass .
alright ?
that doesn' t apply to you petra .
you' re german ... fine , but you' re a cop so it' s ok .
and they have the gall to announce the cities before hitting the banks !
it' s unbelievable !
within 3 days , they will hit a bank in marseille .
red alert , 24 hours a day !
we will have some support in the form of one trained driver per team .
as soon as the germans leave the bank , our teams will follow them . ... not losing them , acting like a venom ....
that' s why this operation will be called ... cobra .
petra , can you assemble the teams please ?
3 per car .
one driver , one coordinator and one sniper .
each team has a code name and a position written on the map behind you .
the team members are listed next to the map .
you have 50 minutes to get into position .
excuse me petra , it' s that dinner we talked about ... ... this week would be nice , because ... ... the computer software i developed , that we' ve talked about ... it would be better not to wait too long , somebody could steal the idea .
no .
just who can' t wait , you or the software ?
me
no , him ... it , the software ... the computer .
you see , it' s complicated that' s why i thought ... ... a dinner ...
as soon as the germans are arrested , i promise , i' il take care of you ... ... of the software i mean .
ah perfect .
by the way , which team are you in ?
i' m with the cobra .
don' t worry , you got lucky .
i put you in the best team .
hey , i think we' re out of coffee .
have you seen my steering wheel ?
it' s great , it' s personalized ... ... i bought it from alain prost .
with a new grip , special dakar .
with even a ton of sand in the car ...
oh yeah ?
too bad we aren' t at the beach then .
hey hey , don' t smoke , it irritates my eyes .
no coffee , no smoking ...
no chicks !!
boa calling tiny snake .
boa calling tiny snake .
this is tinysnake , i hear you .
yeah , it' s alan .
is your team any good ?
amazing .
we' re all exchanging addresses .
and you ?
me ?
somebody is pissing on us but apart from that everything' s fine .
rachid , check out the small black peugot behind us .
man , you' re crazy marco !
we' re not going to steal a car during the day !
oh yeah , why not ?
fuck marco !
there could be cops around here !
we don' t know this neighbourhood , we should stick to what we know .
don' t worry , all the cops are at the airport !
there aren' t any around here for 20 km .
man .
this is crazy .
calm down man !
all the cops are at the airport i told you !
i saw it on tv , there' s clinton and this girl .
hey , cops !
check it out , marco is here , he' s gonna screw you !
let' s arrest him .
no , let him take the car , ... ... let him finish his show , we need the space .
i need to take a leak .
no we can' t leave the car , it' s orders .
you see ?
all at the airport like i said .
smile guys , you' re on camera .
i tell you guys if they don' t show up in one minute with their mercedes ... ... it' s going to be coffee , a smoke and a shit .
we' re going to do all that later man !
to all snakes ... no venom until the mouse leaves its hole .
i repeat no venom until the exit .
lieutenant ?
petra , you' re disturbing me , i was into it .
i know , but it' s the minister .
minister , you aren' t at the airport ?
we just finished .
tell me gibert what about that mercedes gang you told me about ?
yes , you couldn' t have called at a better time , we just located them .
we' re going to act soon .
good , wait a second ...
i just talked to the german minister stop there
they won' t have time to visit marseille
tonight they' il be in jail , and tomorrow i' il send the nazis back home ... special delivery .
exactly my point .
i don' t want to see this end in a shootout between germans and french .
the war is over , gibert .
of course it is , mister .
they are criminals just like any others , they won' t be treated any differently .
maybe you should start by not calling them nazis .
ah , i called them nazis ?
yes .
ah , i called them nazis ?
yes .
i can count on you ?
yes , don' t worry , remember the chinks ...
um , i mean the asians .
everything went smoothly .
almost no deaths , at least not on our side .
hello ?
hello ?
he hung up !
you see , it' s easy .
where are the wires ?
shit , marco ! hurry up !
are you going to steal the car or do i have to give you the keys ?
we are the tiny snakes and that means we stay " cool " .
we' re going to take it " cool " , and not get venomous .
to all snakes , don' t mess up , we want them alive .
at least for an hour .
i don' t really feel in the mood , i guess i' d better leave you guys .
and ...
i really have to take a leak .
let' s go !!
what' s going on ?
it doesn' t look good , minister .
don' t move , minister .
shit !
we fell into a trap , send us backup .
i identified the car ...
i repeat , i identified the accomplice car .
4 well trained men .
backup are coming , minister !
shit , shit !
sir ...
i think we are shooting at cops .
they' re giving up ... aren' t they ?
hello , this is tiny snake , we' ve had a small problem with the door .
good morning sir .
don' t worry , we' il have you free you in 5 minutes .
no problem , no problem .
thank you , sir .
ok , they' re giving up .
funny ... he looks just like ...
like the minister .
oh , you didn' t eat anything .
i' m not really hungry today .
mom , no .
don' t worry about your license .
remember your father , he never got one either .
how is that possible ?
i remember him driving when i was young yes , it' s true .
he took the exam 20 times and in the end they just gave it to him !
ah thanks , i feel a lot better now .
you' re welcome .
here , david , the landlord' s son asked me if you could fix this .
yeah , tell him my name isn' t super mario .
no , i know your name is super cop , the one who upholds the law ... and protects citizens against evil .
oh dear , you have a good profession , i' m proud you .
oh really !
that' s why you tell everyone i work at ibm ?
do you want me to bring you all the neighborhood parking tickets ?
no .
so fine , you work at ibm .
you' re quiet and so am i.
i get to fix all the neighborhood electronic toys .
never happy .
mom , i' m kidding !
can you call me a taxi ?
i' m going to be late .
i just met the perfect one !
friendly , pleasant , the cream of the crop .
you' il like him very much .
hello ?
am i on the wrong floor ?
that depends , who you are looking for ?
i' m looking for camille .
that' s me .
i mean , that' s here .
oh you' re her son the one who works at apple .
no , ibm .
ibm .
mom !
i don' t know anything about computers .
but i saw your picture the other day .
ah daniel , this is my son emilien .
i put labels on them monday is veal , tuesday ...
ok mom , i promise , i' il be ok .
maybe we should go now .
i left the car alone , i' m worried .
good bye !
ah kiss .
kiss , kiss mom !
where are we going ?
voltaire boulevard .
i remember the police station but not ibm .
we are going to the police station .
i install computers there .
if you don' t mind , i' m going to leave you just near the station .
i don' t really like being around pigs .
say , that motor sounds great for a taxi .
you know cars ?
just a fan .
it' s a v6 , a bit modified .
a motor just wants to " sing " .
um , don' t sing too loud , the speed limit is 50 .
you' re talking about the signs written 50 ?
yeah .
i thought it was for skateboards .
no , no , i think it' s for anything that drives .
there' s driving and driving , you see i' m at 100 .
good car ... ... good driver , i' m relaxed .
no risks .
i' m less dangerous at 100 then that shit at 20 km/ h .
there ...
you saw it ?
i saw it , yeah !
you' re not afraid of radars ?
we know where there are radars .
pigs doesn' t like change .
always eating at the same place .
you' il see , there' s one just here .
you see them , they' re so stupid .
picture !
picture !
you know they can' t do anything about it , they just follow the system .
they signed up , nobody forced them .
sometimes i guess they are forced to join
' cause you need to be stupid to join the police force .
look , ... ... i see them a lot ... because of the computers .
the image i had of them was wrong .
really ?
it' s worse than we hear of them ?
no . it' s better .
there aren' t just idiots in the police force .
right , there are also alcoholics , crooks , morons !
seriously , between us ... ... you know any normal person who would want to join the pig farm ?
and taxi drivers ?
what about them ?
you know anybody that would want to become a taxi driver ?
those complainers that take you only when feel like it .
and that scream at you when the tip isn' t good .
and drinking in the coffee shops !
they are all friends with the police .
y se casan con una portera para tener casa gratis .
you' re not married to a cop ?
no ...
ah that' s reassuring !
ok , there are maybe a few drivers who are rude with the customers .
but they are not all like you said .
so ?
with the police it' s the same thing .
they aren' t all drunk at 6 in the morning , beating on innocent people .
some of them do their jobs , just like you ... and like me .
maybe , yeah maybe .
but the thing is , being a taxi driver isn' t my real job .
ah you drive a taxi only for fun ... what is your real job then ?
i' m going to show you .
do you have a bag , i don' t feel good .
don' t worry , as long as we drive fast , nothing will come out .
shit !
i' m sorry sir , that' s the first time that' s happened with me .
usually the client gets out and walks a bit ... then ...
i' m really sorry .
i' m going to confess something .
me too , that' s not my real job ...
oh , no .
oh , yes .
last and first name .
morales , daniel .
profession ... should i write crazy taxi driver or just crazy driver ?
whatever you want .
at what speed were you going back there ?
barely 90 .
barely 90 .
yes , it seems worse because the motor really kicks . ... but in reality , the car doesn' t really go that fast .
hey world champion , how' s it going ?
very good .
can you go look in the stands to see if i' m there ?
remember that taxi , we saw it 5 minutes ago on the street .
going 190 km/ h .
he' s slowing down !
you see ?
not 90 ... 190 .
ah , must be the sun .
i didn' t see the 1 on the speedometer .
that' s why i saw 90 .
if i had known , i would have slowed down .
anyway , 90 is illegal .
the limit is 50 ... for everybody ! cars , skateboards , taxis ... everybody !
is he happy now ? caught ht me , did his job , he' s happy now .
my license is my living , if tonight i' m not driving , tomorrow i' m dead .
you' re going to be nice and finish me quickly .
hey slow down , so i can enjoy it a bit .
usually i' m the one screamed at all day , now for once i get lucky .
i didn' t knock because of my wrist .
ah it doesn' t matter .
that you didn' t knock i mean .
thank you .
your dinner , your software that can' t wait .
yes ?
so it will wait until i' ve healed .
unless you want to have dinner with a scarecrow .
i doesn' t bother me ... you' re perfect petra .
it' s not important ...
i mean no ... yes it matters
it' s important .
it' s very bad for you ... ... but for me .. for the software it doesn' t matter .
you see !
all day it' s like that .
if only i could catch those german bastards
you' re going to finish me now ?
you' il see , you' il feel better .
yeah , i have to ... unless you have an idea .
can promise not to do it again ?
i said an idea , not a an idiocy .
i' m talking about a real idea of public interest .
you want to turn me in a dog shit cleaner ?
no !
something of public interest , for me .
understand ?
it' s like i represent the public ... ... and you do something in my interest .
ah you want money ! .
you' re really stupid !
tell me clearly what you want .
it' s been an hour now with your blabbing .
what do you want ?
listen .
the mercedes gang , does that ring a bell ?
no , the only gangs i know would be into scooters .
they' re a gang specialized in robbing banks .
yesterday was the 7th .
and that pisses me off .
ah that' s too bad .
yes , mostly for us .
listen , i' il make you a proposal .
you' re a good mechanic , you drive well and i need a driver .
3 good reasons to hire you as an assistant for 1 month .
i' il remove all your infractions .
you want me to be a cop for 1 month ?
choose : cop or pedestrian .
death or shame ?
you got it .
here you have all 7 attacks in order .
don' t know much about mercedes i' m more ferrari .
right now the gang is " mercedes " but as soon they get into ferraris , i' il call you .
a red mercedes , how awful .
i know it' s red , tell us something we don' t know .
we' ve looked everywhere but maybe ...
we just need a detail .
you' re talking about a detail ...
your gang .
they' re german .
very nice !
mercedes , therefore germans .
you want to relax 5 minutes now ?
you must be exhausted .
the tires are very inflated , typical of germans .
also they have 8 " so they had to do that in germany ' cause you can' t find that in france .
the tires are quite worn , they' il need to order some soon .
in this picture , the muffler is a little bent but not on this one .
they must have bent it during an attack and repaired it afterwards .
kruger is the only one who repairs this type in marseille .
and kruger is german .
luckily you' re not a mercedes expert !
where are we going ?
we' re starting with kruger to see if he remembers anything .
what are you waiting for ?
you want me to sing a song ?
in this neighbourhood , i wouldn' t turn the christmas lights on .
what are we doing now ?
we' re starting the phase that takes 80 % of a policeman' s life ... ... observation .
get familiar with the terrain , observation of entrances and exits . ... and analyse the situation .
when it closes we' il go ask mr. kruger a few questions .
when does the store close ?
kruger ?
he never closes , he' s an insomniac .
thanks !
they didn' t have anything else .
too bad we didn' t stop by my mother' s , she makes terrific sandwiches .
ham and cheese .
half bayonne , half parisian .
it' s excellent .
she made you one ?
yeah .
a small slice of cheese in the middle with lettuce . ... and pickles .
fabulous .
this is mine ?
really good , congratulations .
what does he do ?
they' re koreans .
a real pain in the ass for me , they work 24 hours a day .
he must sleep at some point , they' re human .
no , they' ve got a " technique " .
one taxi , one plate , one license ... ... and 2 drivers .
you can tell the difference between 2 koreans incredible .
i know a korean , he' s in the food business .
no .
we wait for him to close the garage .
we' re going to wait a long time , the guy is an insomniac and never closes .
how do you know that ?
from the bar owner just in front of us .
why didn' t you tell me before ?
i haven' t been in the police force long , i don' t have the reflexes .
it' s not a matter of being a cop , it' s just common sense , shit !
we' re here like 2 idiots waiting for an insomniac to go to sleep !
does that sound logical to you ?
if i' m the mercedes driver and i know the mechanic is an insomniac ... ... i' il come during the night , it' s much more discrete .
oh yeah ?
you think the driver will just show up ... ... with his nice mercedes ?
i can' t believe it !
when a driver isn' t driving , he' s in the garage .
what are they doing there ?
probably the 8 " tires they ordered from kruger .
it' s a miracle !
i can' t let such an opportunity get away .
if it goes bad , call the station and give them the mercedes plate numbers .
where are you going ?
after observation , action .
the korean trick .
what ?
the korean trick !
what an idiot !
and the new tires , where are they going to put them ?
what are you doing there ?
me ?
sleeping .
i don' t have a house , my country is very cold .
please !
don' t hurt me !
i just wanted to sleep .
i' m going to find you a house where you' il sleep ... and even eat maybe with a little bit of luck .
hey you' re hurting me !
i just do what i can .
what' s your name ?
daniel .
ah , yeah .
daniel .
i' m emilien .
we' re going to call each other by name , it' il be better .
yeah , better .
now that we' re friends , what just happened ...
it stays between us ...
when you let go of my hand , can i go to bed ?
i' m no insomniac or korean .
of course not .
i waited for you all night .
i did it on purpose , so that you really want me .
you won' t regret waiting .
promises , promises .
let me see what you can do .
ah , not too bad .
a little bit more .
huh ?
what' s going on ?
it' s 6 am and it' s not sunday , it' s monday .
you can' t do that , lily .
i waited all night .
and me ?
did i play dominos ?
can' t you call in sick ?
sick on monday morning ?
my boss will love that .
nobody has ever tried that one .
it can happen to anybody to be sick monday morning .
you went to eat at your parents and you ate too much ... ... and you puked all night .
it' s possible , isn' t it ?
a man that works all week and then isn' t around on sunday .
do you think it' s reasonable ?
i' m really sorry , lily .
i had a shitty day .
i promise that if you accept a dinner here tonight , i' il explain everything .
ok , just a light meal .
i don' t want to be sick on tuesday morning .
yes , a short time at the table and a long time in bed .
we could even eat in bed to save time .
you' d better be good , it' s your last chance .
i' m going to impress you .
we' re going to wait all day in front of the garage again ?
observation is finished , now comes questioning .
are you interested in seeing some real questioning ?
no .
well , you' re going to come anyway .
it' s better if i wait in the taxi , in case things go bad ... like last time .
i need a translator .
i don' t want him to confuse me with technicalities .
kruger won' t waste time to kick you out , i' m telling you .
good morning people .
which one of you is called kruger , please ?
it' s written on the label just like a waitress .
mr. kruger , i' ve got a few questions for you .
don' t worry , it won' t be long .
fuck no more ammo !
what for ?
they left a long time ago .
really ?
open your eyes , there' s nobody here .
oh yeah , nobody .
can i ask you a little question ?
what ?
are your questioning sessions always like that , or was it just to please me ?
usually i get to ask at least 1 question .
let' s go out to get some air .
you know , you saved my life back there .
no .
yes .
it was worth a lot .
so let' s get rid of that one month of labour .
and turn it into only 1 week .
you know how to deal .
i need to catch that gang , it' s important for me .
because of the blonde chick ?
no .
in part yes , but mostly for me .
i' m tired of finishing off nights in the garbage can .
it' s a question of honour , maybe it' s crazy , but i need this .
can i have the night for myself ?
you' ve got to be kidding .
can i borrow him ?
mom , it' s because ...
i lost my prescription and the doctor agreed to write another one .
they' re closing in 5 minutes .
it' s my heart medicine .
i won' t let you die here , and that way i' il have saved the whole family today .
you' re so charming , daniel .
i know , i know .
look johnny , here they come .
don' t worry , baby .
i' ve put a transmitter in that bullet , that way they won' t get away .
you' re so clever johnny it' s my job , baby .
johnny .
now we just have to follow them .
incredible ! ... let' s save your father .
i' il never forget what you' ve done for me johnny .
it' s my job , baby .
guys , we just received a call .
they give us a rendezvous .
it' s gonna be the bank of marseille .
since they are clear with us , i' m going to be the same with you .
i won' t tolerate any misbehaviour , any accidents , nothing !
perfect coordination .
there are 2 words for this mission ...
serenity ... ... and efficiency .
so i' ve decided to name this mission ..
the mission ... ...
zen .
chief !
listen up tiny snakes and cobras !
i just got the idea of the century .
the mercedes gang will be nailed tonight , or my name isn' t emilien barbadec .
i hope your plan is foolproof ' cause this is your last chance .
you' ve got the gun , so be nice and don' t miss .
everybody on the floor !
quickly !
hands on the head !
lie down !
don' t move .
come on !
it' s working .
good , very good .
follow them at a distance .
so you won' t be scared .
they stopped .
gauguin street .
i' m telling you , we' ve got them .
this is gilbert .
all units : close off gauguin street at 10 km . around .
they didn' t move .
just one street .
what' s happening ?
the dot disappeared .
i know it disappeared .
find out why it vanished .
they must be this way , ... ... a red mercedes doesn' t go by unnoticed .
they' re close , i can feel it .
they' re supposed to be here .
go , go !
don' t shoot , i' m the hostage .
emilien ...
how ... ?
i don' t understand , i' m missing something .
a red mercedes vanished .
even houdini never did that .
hello , your papers please .
what' s going on , officer ?
you' re german ?
yes why ?
already at the border ?
chief , 4 germans in a mercedes , not red .
interested ?
i' il handle it .
so you' re german .
yes , is that a problem ?
no , it' s good actually .
open the trunk .
what are they doing in marseille ?
they came to spend deutchmarks ...
... but they can do that in another country if you prefer ...
no , ... ... i prefer that you keep that in our territory .
ok , goodbye .
have a nice stay .
emilien .
i don' t understand , it' s impossible .
i must have missed something .
you see , he forgot about the kettle .
you think so ?
he' s not like that .
it' s 8pm .
i' ve turned on the answering machine , and the alarm is set for 6am .
we' ve got 10 hours .
it should be enough , no ?
i think it' s going to be close ... ... but we can hurry just a bit at the end .
expecting somebody ?
yes my lover , but when i found out you' d come , i cancelled .
who could it be ?
leave it , they' il probably go .
where were we ?
i was kissing you .
no , you were kissing me .
and if it' s important ?
how ?
i don' t know ... the cops ...
yeah , maybe you' re a notorious criminal and they' ve come to get you .
you would take me hostage .
and if you just took me now ?
open , police !
you didn' t kill anybody ?
no .
thank god , daniel !
you' re here !
fantastic !
you just can' t imagine what shit i' m in .
yes , i can imagine .
no , no you can' t imagine .
it' s gone , we don' t have an apartment anymore .
the apartment that my father gave us .
gone up in smoke , just like my father .
my husband smoked a lot , ... ... but he died of liver cancer , we never knew why , he didn' t drink .
the apartment is nothing , the worst is that i messed up again .
if i don' t catch them by the end of the week , i' il be on traffic patrol by monday .
stick , whistle , move along kids !
what i' m saying is , monday i' m dead .
daniel , who' s that dwarf ?
a friend .
really ?
playing with smurfs now ?
it' s a bit complicated , he' s a cop ...
what ?
you' ve got a friend in the police ?
not a real friend , ...
... i work for him , because ...
you work for the cops ?
no , not for the cops , for him !
he' s not really a cop .... ... he looks more like a secret agent , or something like that .
right , and the old lady is mata hari .
can someone explain this to her ?
i can' t do it .
hello .
my name is camille .
the smurf over there is my son , emilien .
i want you to show me the kitchen , i' m going to make us some coffee . and then i' il explain everything .
there' s nothing to explain mom ... ... i' m finished , i' m in the street .
it' s over , but it started so well ... but then came the garbage bin , the butcher , the mercedes ...
what are you going to do with them then ?
should i call the cops , the real ones ?
just be nice , and don' t complicate the situation .
ok , agreed ?
i' m not complicating the situation .
i just want to finish what we started .
and i don' t want to waste an hour because the schedule is very tight .
i' m caught in a tight spot and when i say caught i mean seriously .
i could lose my license for 100 years .
i help him and he gives me back my licence , 100 years of unemployment you see ?
police , blackmailer , and smurf .
nice picture , you could have finished him before putting him in traffic .
here you go , it was completely stupid of me .
i' m not kidding , you' re free .
take it .
daniel , you know i didn' t come here because of our deal .
i haven' t got any other friends .
mom told me you had a big heart .
daniel has a big heart .
really , he' il help ? .
ok , i think we made a mistake .
it doesn' t matter .
it' s not important , it' s not your problem .
don' t worry , i' il catch that gang alone .
without a car , it won' t be easy .
but i' m gonna do it .
listen , the best way to get rid of him is to solve his problem .
but he doesn' t have one problem , he' s got a thousand .
look at his face , he reminds me of " silence of the lambs " .
you take care of mata hari and i' il take care of the smurf .
in 2 hours i' m back .
and what do i do with the lady for 2 hours ?
should we play bingo ?
please , lily .
if in 2 hours you' re not here , i burn the lady .
it' s a deal .
come on .
where are we going ?
to solve your problem .
i' m sorry to have ruined your evening .
your coffee is really good ?
the best in town .
a nice coffee to change the mood and for forgiveness .
i know you don' t really want to talk to me anymore , but please listen .
ok ?
is 1 minute enough ?
yes .
i thought about it all night and there was one question i couldn' t answer .
why are they pissing us off like that ?
why a red mercedes when grey is much more discrete ?
look here , then ... ... it appears over there !
it' s a diversion !
conclusion : i think they left the building empty handed and the money took another route .
or maybe the money is still in the bank .
1 minute , end of show .
i' il be back later .
10 grand .
thank you very much .
to help pay the rent for the next few years .
and my wife ?
you really want her ?
well , i' m used to her now .
calm down dear .
now , everything' s going to be fine .
one more bank , and we retire .
and for the last one , i suggest we finish greatly .
emilien .
emilien !
you' re a pain .
i' il tell you how they changed from a red to a grey mercedes .
go ahead .
they didn' t change the car , they changed the colour .
a nice red mercedes enters the parking lot ... ... and a classic grey mercedes exists and then disappears .
is it possible ?
child' s play .
if they did repaint the car we would have found paint traces somewhere .
unless they used a truck to get the car in .
they' d need to buy tons of paint if they do that each time .
they did it in record time , they had less than 10 minutes .
is there paint which dries in 10 minutes ?
hello , geg ?
sorry to wake you , it' s daniel .
i need your magic paint , the md10 .
color metal grey .
you ran out ?
who could have bought all that in one shot ?
at the race track ?
what are they doing with that much paint ?
are they painting the track red ?
no , don' t worry about it .
i' il try dealing with them myself .
talk to you soon , thanks man .
what does that mean , md10 ?
less than 10 minutes .
so ?
you like my theory ?
you think it' s them ?
no , it' s some old ladies training every tuesday .
explain it to me daniel .
what' s the plan ?
what are you doing ?
we' re going to say hello .
they' re going to see us .
yep , we' il make it so they won' t forget us .
they' re going to remember me , they saw me in the trunk !
put that on .
oh shit .
is it alright like that ?
it' s perfect .
hey faggots , everything ok ?
think you' re schumacher ?
you spin around the track .
what are those little cars you' ve got ?
mercedes ?
they build cars too ?
do germans know how to play the tortoise and the hare ?
he doesn' t know how to play ?
i' m going to teach him .
give me 55 .
maybe i should get out now , eh ?
no , you' il see , they' re playful .
the turtle and the hare goes like this ... ... 55 to the one that passes my car over 2 laps .
1 + 1 .
you know how to count ?
we don' t want the money .
i said 55 because i had a good conscience not to take more .
but a tourist that doesn' t get robbed is not really a tourist , right ?
look in your rear view mirror in case i' ve already lapped you after the 1st lap .
so it wouldn' t be worth an doing an extra lap .
thanks girls !
get lost !
quick !
it' s not that i' m bored but i gotta go to the garage .
i don' t know what' s going on with my car .
it just doesn' t run fast anymore .
whenever you want , we' il have a rematch .
here' s your 55 .
what are we doing now ?
let' s get a drink .
french ...
you' re completely crazy , we had the whole gang .
and you pull that stupid stunt ?
we could have called for backup and got them !
yeah , on what ?
speeding ... on a race track ?
great evidence .
we would have found the evidence later , we do it all the time .
we need to catch them in the act , that' s what you said ?
yes or no ?
but for the moment we' re only collecting offences .
if we continue , it' s us who will end up in jail .
you' il have your flag .
now they' re all warmed up and nobody' s more playful than a pilot .
now we can set a trap for them .
yeah ?
what kind of trap ?
a trap for idiots .
and what is your " idiot trap " ?
not an " idiot trap " .
i said a trap for idiots .
ok .
how does it goes ?
it goes like this : we make them go where we want .
and this is : here .
we' il need 20 traffic light keys and 20 super walkie talkies .
walkie talkies are ok but for the keys , the guys always carry them .
except when they take their showers .
oh no ?
oh yes .
oh no ?
oh yes .
you' ve got talent !
here you go , jimmy .
it' s going to take time , i' m freezing .
one minute .
emilien , i got one ...
what are you doing naked ?
i' m not naked .
i' ve got a towel wrapped around me .
what do you care ?
i have the right to be naked in my office , no ?
it' s my office isn' t it ?
yes .
nobody taught you to knock before entering ?
you' ve never learned anything idiot !
oh , what a welcome !
i wanted to tell you a good joke .
your jokes are never funny , get out !
ah ! it feels so good !
come in !
petra ... !
am i disturbing you ?
never !
yes , i can see i' m disturbing you .
i' il come back later .
for once she comes into my office with something to tell me ... ... and i' m naked in the middle of the office .
can you believe that daniel ?
what can i say ?
anyway look at that ...
she' s so beautiful .
and she' s already sergeant .
what could she want with a guy like me ?
ho , ho .
enough .
you' re done whining ?
you already started digging your grave .
she' s not lady charity .
an engine like her doesn' t work with low grade oil .
what she needs is a man .
get up !
you look more like an monkey now .
stand up straight !
now you go see her and you kiss her and that' s it .
you either get a slap in the face or you get her for at least 10 years .
there' s a 50/ 50 chance .
if it doesn' t work at least you' il know .
it' s like a game show , either you get it or you don' t .
are you ok , emilien ?
are you alright ?
you' re right .
we shouldn' t worry like that .
i' il go for it .
i got it .
it was a 50/ 50 .
he' il have other chances .
where are we with the keys ?
done !
take them .
you think they' re going to be mad ?
if a girl shows up 17 hours late , what would you do ?
i kill her .
so you got your answer !
but we' ve got flowers here .
oh the nice flowers !
can we smoke them ?
did you bake all these cakes ?
yes .
since we both didn' t get any love , we got our revenge on the cakes .
what a crisis !
thanks , camille .
i had a wonderful day .
are the flowers for me ?
thanks , goodbye .
you don' t want to have a intimate evening ?
you' ve got visitors , daniel .
you have to take care of them .
we' il do it an other day , we' re not short of time .
camille will sleep in your bed , her back hurts .
good night boys .
man this is good stuff .
sure , it' s jamaican .
you see , it' s not so bad in the forces .
stop it , you' re tempting me .
tell me , why didn' t you race directly instead of doing it with a taxi ?
my father spent his life in a wheelchair because of a car accident .
how could i explain him that i wanted to be a race car driver ?
i see .
and you ?
how did you end up where you are ?
my story isn' t bad either .
my dad died when i was 17 , my mother and i were alone .
so i had to go to work right away .
and without a degree , only the cops wants you .
where did you live ?
in asnires .
in jules ferry ?
yes .
why ?
you too ?
yes , i swear .
it' s crazy , we could have ended up in the same class .
i would have taught you to steal bikes and you wouldn' t have turned out so bad !
life' s like that , you dream about so many things when you' re a kid and in the end ... ... nothing goes as planned .
you dream of playing forward and you end up a goalie .
do you think our plan will work , daniel ?
it will work .
are you sure ?
come in .
am i disturbing you ?
no , i' m fine now .
what do you need ?
red alert !
guys , the cougar' s plan has started .
it' s the s. d. l. m. banks .
here are you positions for today .
arthur , at the crossroads n 1 .
jacky , n 2 , ... ... at national flamarion crossroads .
momo at the crossroads de le bech .
n 2 , radio and key .
n 3 , radio and key .
n 4 ...
yes ?
yes , i know you' il come back in 1 hour .
exactly .
i' il wait for you at your place .
cougar speaking the bird is in the cage .
everybody quiet !
on your knees !
cougar speaking .
the bird will soon leave his cage .
prepare yourselves .
shit , they got hostages .
don' t do anything yet .
sorry , no more room for you .
ok , no problem .
you' re going to run next to the car .
it won' t be bad for you .
i' m tired !
shit !
all cougar units get out !
catch the bird !
catch the bird !
you see it' s not the mercedes we needed to follow ... it' s the mercedes truck we needed to follow .
this calls for a toast !
and now we all go home !
cheers !
cheers !
it' s a go .
everything ready ?
20 strategic points blocked .
if they cross any of these diagonals they' re caught like rats .
if they take michelet boulevard , they' il end up at place mazard .
who' s on that corner ?
jean bat , n 7 .
call him , he' il be the opening act .
n 7 , jean bat .
you hear me ?
yes , i' m here .
you' il be the first , are you in position ?
yes , no problem .
so it' s our turn now .
it doesn' t fit there .
yes , yes .
hey bavarians , how are you ?
still driving the tractor ?
sorry about last time .
i forgot i had the handbrake on , that' s why i didn' t go very fast .
hey , i' m talking to you .
now it' s a lot better .
do we race again or are you staying the losers ?
ok .
you french always have such big mouths .
come onto the highway with me , we' il see !
did i upset you ?
i' m going blow up your peugeot !
sorry , i did upset you .
i' il give you an other chance , but i' il try harder this time .
i feel cheap taking money from you so easily .
here you go darling , 10 francs .
you' re going to pay for your insolence .
better to be insolent than ridiculous !
i think you overdid it a bit .
no , no .
tell 7 , 8 and 9 to go to red .
jean bat , go to red now .
n 10 , in position .
n 11 , in position .
perfect .
12 and 13 , prepare yourselves .
this is number 13 .
i' ve got a small problem here .
there are 2 cops at the traffic light .
shit !
get rid of them !
easy to say !
they' re not going anywhere .
we' re getting close , find a solution !
otherwise , we' re finished .
pollo , let me talk to the cops .
sorry sir , it' s for you .
hello .
this is sergeant gibert , we' ve found a bomb and it' s just next to you .
where ?
in the traffic light .
stay calm , we know how to stop the mechanism .
listen carefully : put the key in the light and make the light turn red .
it' s already red !
don' t worry about the colour ! ... just turn the key to the right !
yes , yes , sergeant .
we just passed 12 .
hurry up , hurry up !
can i do it ?
19 and 20 , get ready .
after 20 , there' s nothing .
i know .
are you sure there' s a road there ?
it' s a shortcut .
on the highway , they' re dead .
we' ve got more power .
if there was a fence , maybe there was a reason .
yep , the highway isn' t finished , it' s a dead end .
the important thing is that you know it .
i look calm like but in fact i' m not .
it won' t be long .
that' s what worries me , i want to live long !
10 seconds .
take that frog !
we' ve got to stop , there' s no bridge !
5 seconds .
go !
take him !
take him !
let them win , daniel !
you only bet 10 francs !
i don' t want to die for 10 francs !
it' s now or never !
hold on !!!
way to go , karl !
we won !
are you sure ?
i swear , you scared me to death !
i really thought you would rather die than lose .
between the tortoise and the hare it' s always the tortoise that wins !
einstein !
you know " la fontaine " ?
big hare not happy to been fucked by little tortoise .
cougar will be happy .
for a long time he' s wanted to eat hare .
yes , big hare , big hare .
i' m sorry about the place .
it' s not very romantic .
but i really wanted it .
oh really ?
you really wanted ...
i didn' t feel it .
should we try again ?
no , later .
we' ve really got to go now .
daniel , what are you doing ?
i' ve been looking for you for 15 minutes .
what were you doing in the dark ?
photo finishing .
it' s not the time for photo finishing .
the sergeant is waiting !
in the name of the president of the republic ... ... it is an honour to offer you the medal of the knight .
congratulations .
i owe you an apology .
for not believing in me , or for slapping me ?
both .
how can you forgive me ?
we' il find a way .
i read the story of your exploits .
amazing !
this experience made us think .
thank you .
we are going to change the way we see the road .
we are going to implement a police force more efficient and modern .
and all that thanks to you .
thank you .
this medal is only a symbol .
it won' t give you your license back .
i was hoping for more ...
mercy ?
exactly .
we' ve got mercy .
we' ve got enough to put you in jail for many years ... but you are free .
i' m not free , i can' t drive .
i understand .
without a car , you are like an orphan .
yes , an orphan on foot .
i understand .
i got a solution but i' m not sure it will suit you .
tell me , and we' il see .
so ?
are you happy ?
yes .
you' re not happy ?
yes it' s great .
i don' t understand .
your first grand prix , pole position , a great car , friends ...
... your girlfriend .
what' s wrong ?
the sponsor !
we find him money , a car and he' s still not happy .
tell the cheerleader to stop moving , it distracts me .
you know what you could do that would make me happy ?
what ?
win that race !
because we don' t give a damn about the sponsors on the car .
ok then , take the champagne out of the freezer .
it' s not good too cold .
let' s go , daniel !
gosseyn subs .
revised jester .
