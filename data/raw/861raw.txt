and it' s comin ' with arms that are pillows
and this evening it all will be mine
there' s a coach comin ' in and you' re smellin ' like a steer
get the soap out it ain' t far away
cut the socks from your feet
rake your hair till it' s neat
there' s a coach comin ' in there' s a coach comin ' in today
there' s a coach comin ' in hurry , hurry , do you hear ?
with a cargo o ' joy from paree
drop the tables and chairs get them beds up the stairs
and be sure every lock has a key
for it' s coming with girls who buy perfume
who wear powder and rouge from paree
who will have to go somewhere to get them
and the somewhere to go will be me
there' s a coach comin ' in and it' s flyin ' like a deer
thank the lord there' s relief on the way
thank with all of your hearts
for them half dozen tarts
there' s a coach comin ' in today
there' s a coach comin ' in lf you listen you can hear it
a clip cloppin ' over the hill
and the sound that you hear ls as good to your ear
as the call of a wild whippoorwill
for it' s bringin ' me eyes that are moonlight
and it' s carryin ' lips that are wine
and it' s comin ' with arms that are pillows
and this evening it all will be mine
there' s a coach comin ' in you can feel it gettin ' near
all at once and it bursts into view
and it looks to your eye like it fell from the sky
like a coach full of dreams come true
for it' s bringin ' me eyes that are moonlight
and it' s carryin ' lips that are wine
and it' s comin ' with arms that are pillows
and this evening it all will be mine
there' s a coach comin ' in now it' s riding in the clear
and the sound of it grows to a din
no , there ain' t far to go now they' re hollerin ' " whoa !
there' s a coach comin ' in there' s a coach comin '
and it' s here
ben !
pardner , i wanna talk to you !
you rotten , lecherous , deceiving , no good , thieving ...
the only reason i ain' t blowing your brains out is the relief it' s gonna give me when i tear you apart with my bare hands .
what' s the matter with you ?
what was the two of you doing on the same horse ?
riding .
what else ?
that' s the last place i' d ...
where was her horse ?
that was her horse .
and where was your horse ?
you had my horse .
lf that' s true , why ain' t you fighting back ?
cos you ain' t been yourself lately .
that' s a widely known fact , and you know it yourself .
get up , pardner .
how' s your jaw ?
feels like it' s coming off .
you ought to trust me , ben .
you' re right .
you ain' t the kind of man that' d go lusting after another man' s wife , especially with them six bawds arriving in town .
that' s right , ben .
i wouldn' t do that .
the only kind of feelings you' d ever have would be deep ones , and if you had ' em for elizabeth , you' d come and tell me before you would her .
that' s right , ben .
that' s what i' d do .
you' re a good man , pardner .
that' s what i was coming to do .
tell you i got some deep feelings for elizabeth .
you hit me one more time , i' il bust your skull open .
nothing' s happened , and nothing' s gonna happen , cos i' m leaving .
you' re breaking up the partnership ?
lf i hang around here long enough watching you and her together ,
i' il become as big a lunatic as you are .
all right .
i' il go get your share of the gold dust .
you can have the mule and that new gold pan .
you can even have the rocker , if you want to .
what' s the matter , ben ?
where you taking the rocker ?
it' s for pardner .
he' s going away .
going away ?
he never mentioned going away to me .
of course not .
you don' t know that man like i do , elizabeth .
what are you saying ?
he loves you .
that' s why he' s going .
i don' t want pardner to go .
i love him .
unpack , pardner .
you ain' t going nowhere .
that woman loves you .
and that puts a new wheel on the wagon , don' t it ?
get this straight .
i' m not taking away your wife , and that' s final .
but you love her .
so do you .
there' s only one way for anybody to be happy and that' s ... for one of us to move away and forget it .
and i' m going .
get out of my way .
pardner , there comes a time in the life of every partnership when the party of the first part has no recourse except to knock some sense into the party of the second part !
you' re staying !
what happened ?
he' s staying .
ls he hurt ?
no .
just tired .
he' il be good as new in a couple of weeks .
where you going , ben ?
you love pardner ?
you take him .
and you take good care of him .
that' s the decentest man i ever run across .
and the strongest .
now , i know you women like things legal , so here' s what .
it takes two weeks for you to be an abandoned claim .
after that , you take the name of your new owner and file it down at the mining office .
then everything' il be legal .
i don' t want you to go .
i love you .
what are you talking about ?
you' re my husband .
i don' t want you to go away .
what was that ?
don' t let him go , pardner .
you said she was in love with me .
didn' t you say you loved him ?
yes , i did , and i do .
you just said you were in love with ben .
yes , i did , and i am .
ben , do you get that feeling you need a drink ?
how did you know ?
cos i do , too .
but , pardner , you don' t drink .
no , but i' m changing .
and it takes a woman to do it .
bless their hearts .
now , elizabeth , let' s try and be reasonable about this .
for god' s sake , make up your mind !
i can' t .
i love both of you .
but that ain' t going to work .
you can' t have both of us .
why not ?
why not ?
why not ?
a woman can' t have two husbands .
i was married to a man who had two wives .
why can' t a woman have two husbands ?
because you can' t .
well , why ?
you explain it to her , ben .
i' d like to oblige , pardner , but i' il be damned if i can think of a reason .
out here we make up our own rules as we go along .
a man with two wives wants to sell one at auction , nobody thinks twice .
lf a town needs females , hijacking ' em seems the natural thing to do .
and if two pardners want to share a wife , why not ?
this ain' t michigan .
it' s gold country .
why , hell , it' s the golden country !
untouched and uncontaminated by human hands !
people can look civilisation in the eye and spit !
you don' t have to please anybody , don' t have to love thy neighbour .
it' s wild , human and free , and all over this nation , they preach against it every sunday .
but i don' t think god' s listening .
you know why ?
because he' s here , in glorious california !
you trying to say you' re willing ?
i am .
i think it' s a humane , practical , beautiful solution .
it does make a lot of sense .
it don' t .
it don' t in michigan .
it does in california .
what' s everybody gonna say ?
who are you talking about ?
you mean everybody in town playing them french horns ?
they' d be damn glad to have two less in line .
you' re right .
of course i' m right .
it' s not like somebody was asking you to do something immoral , like stealing gold !
it ain' t as bad as all that .
what the hell' s bad about it ?
show me on that list of commandments where it says a woman can' t have two husbands .
there ain' t no commandment like that !
hot damn !
i think it' s great !
it' s history making !
can' t hold it .
elizabeth ?
yes , ben ?
we will be three for dinner .
shameless harlots !
you think the lord was some boy in a raggedy old sheet 2, 000 years ago ?
you' re wrong .
he' s here now and he sees you !
ye godless jaspers !
who are you ?
freemasons ?
rosicrucians ?
heathen emissaries from the dens of babylon ?
boozers .
gluttons .
gamblers .
harlots .
fornicators !
what' s a fornicator ?
i don' t know .
i ain' t religious .
the stench of the city is in the lord' s nostrils , making him sick .
the lord ain' t gonna take it much longer !
come on up , parson , and get some old time religion .
mrs rumson .
how are your husbands ?
fine .
thank you , mr atwell .
husbands ?
did i hear husbands ?
you animals !
you pagans !
o god , lord of hosts , close thine eyes , then hold thy nose .
i am passing through the garbage of humanity !
come on , dearie .
scum , keep your filthy claws off my wife , princess hummingbird !
you heathen swine !
do you know what god done to sodom and gomorrah when he couldn' t find 50 righteous men in them stinking cities ?
i' il show god a place where there ain' t 40 .
yeah !
30 !
yeah !
two !
yeah !
or one !
yeah !
and here it is .
you want to see sin of the wickedest kind ?
here it is
you want to see virtue left behind ?
here it is
sodom was vice and vice a versa
you want to see where the vice is worser ?
here it is
i mean , here it is
you want to live life in the rottenest way ?
here it is
women and whisky night and day here it is
you want to embrace the golden calf ankle and thigh and upper half ?
here it is i mean , here it is
no name city , no name city the lord don' t like it here
no name city , no name city your reckonin ' day is near
no name city , no name city here' s what he' s gonna do
gobble up this town swallow it down and goodbye to you
will you go to heaven ?
will you go to hell ?
either repent or fare thee well
god' il take care o ' no name city
comes the end and it won' t be pretty
here it is i mean , here it is
amen
evening , pardner .
evening , elizabeth .
evening , ben .
evening , elizabeth .
i hear george lonergan pulled out today .
he' s smart .
he' s broke .
ben thinks placer mining' s all but finished in these parts .
what are we gonna do ?
i hear talk of a strike up to red dog .
i' m not leaving my home , ben .
i wasn' t suggesting it .
i' il live on grass and mud water before i' d do that .
ben isn' t asking you to leave your home .
damn it !
why not ?
you like this town as much as i like schermerhorn !
that' s right , i hate what this town has become , but it' s one place we can live together .
and there' s nothing i hate as much as i love the two of you and this cabin .
lf you want to go to red dog , you go ahead , but i' m staying here .
you come back whenever you want to .
the only thing stopping you being perfect is your stubbornness .
somebody should hit you till it' s gone .
somebody' s gotta support us .
you can' t go through a whole winter here alone .
i won' t leave her here alone .
you' d let this man who took care of you and nursed you back to health
light out alone while you sleep through winter like a fat groundhog ?
lf he goes , you go .
and i ain' t going .
well , i' il go , then .
lf he goes , you go with him .
didn' t i just tell you you can' t go through a winter alone here ?
you ever see such a stubborn woman ?
no , i never did .
but if you ever hit her , you' il have to deal with me straightaway .
i sure am one tired man tonight .
must be from lifting those cards .
i only played a few hands last night .
i had a lucky streak .
i broke even .
you' il tell three fingered sweeney i' il pay him next week .
you was playing poker last night ?
i was , and you was tired .
remember ?
well , i think i' il go have a last drink with them three limeys .
they' re pulling out tomorrow .
how much does he owe sweeney ?
wait .
i won' t take your money .
why not ?
cos a man don' t do that in michigan or in california .
that' s ok with me , but if you want to keep your manhood , quit trying to beat three aces with a pair of fours .
see you at breakfast .
sorry , boys , pardner ain' t playing tonight .
willie ?
have you seen mad jack ?
he' s over there .
i want to convert this dust into dollars .
look out !
he' s losing gold dust every time you bump his elbow .
there' s more spilled here in one night than we' ve dug up in a month .
must be a pirate' s fortune under them floorboards .
where are you heading ?
where i can find some gold .
fleshpot hill , brass monkey ravine .
i don' t know .
save your souls and help build a house for the lord .
he can have my shack .
i' m moving out .
you heathen scum .
money .
and the lord sayeth , " money is the root of all evil .
cos he ain' t never been rich .
he knoweth about you ...
you don' t say ?
living like animals .
you' re going to hell !
i hope so .
it ain' t too far down ,
i' il tunnel and get some gold dust that' s fallen through these floor ...
how do you figure we can dig a tunnel without being seen ?
we' il dig down from the floor in our cabin , under the street , and right up under here .
a tunnel ?
you idiot !
why , you lunatic .
dig now .
hit him later .
what the hell' s happening ?
we' re tunnelling under willie' s .
after that gold dust under his floor .
how did you know ?
been thinking about it for weeks .
why didn' t you speak up ?
you dirty , lazy , drunken ...
lazy , am l ?
damn you , duncan !
shut up !
look , dig now .
hit him later .
right .
you can hit me later .
i' il remind you .
don' t forget .
pardner' s in on this .
then where is he ?
he' s at home .
doing what ?
damn you !
keep a civil tongue or i' il ...
you can hit him later .
right .
you can hit me later .
and i' il remind you .
dig !
hey , willie , you seen ben rumson ?
sorry .
close the bloody door .
you' re digging a hole .
you don' t miss a trick , do you ?
pardner , we got big news for you .
you' re what ?
we ain' t stopping at willie' s .
there' s 16 gambling halls , seven hotels and 21 saloons .
mad jack figures we can build tunnels under them , honeycomb main street , one end to the other .
what do we do with all that earth ?
give it to the meek .
have you gone crazy ?
he' s not crazy .
there' s a lot of gold dust going through those floors .
i think there' s more than a lot .
i think maybe there' s enough for the winter .
hurry up and eat this , both of you .
coffee will be ready in a minute .
i don' t want you to be late to work .
the earth is pure muck muck' s a good thing
and oozin ' with mud mud is just fine
it' s drownin ' in bog bog is good luck
and crawlin ' with crud crud' s a good sign
the poor , they got hope the rich can buy soap
what rainbows ain' t got a pot of
and i ain' t got a spot of
a few feet down there' s a lot of
just waitin ' to buy tobacco and rye from now till i die
the best things in life are dirty and nothing in life is
better to hold than dirty gold the best things in life are
filthy , dirty hunks of gold , gold , gold
there' s more than just gold gold is enough
that' s buried below beautiful gold
there' s seed in the ground loveable gold
just waitin ' to grow spendable gold
a man has his creed and mine is all greed
what banks have bulgin ' accounts of
and i ain' t got an ounce of
below there' s endless amounts of just dirty old trash
that turns in a flash to dirty old cash
the best things in life are dirty the worst thing in life is
wakin ' up clean without a bean the best things in life are
filthy dirty hunks of gold , gold , gold
the best things in life are dirty the worst thing in life is
being content without a cent the best things in life are
filthy dirty hunks of gold , gold , gold , gold
stinkin ' rotten chunks of blimey , slimy , lousy , lovely
gold .
you bummers , over here !
i found him in the mountains .
he' s half frozen .
he says there' s a wagon train marooned up there .
get up a rescue party !
let' s get out of these mountains before a storm comes up .
pack up !
you' ve arrived at the height of the season , mr fenty , but we' il find hotel space for the whole bloody lot of you .
lf you don' t die , you' il have one hell of a time .
we shouldn' t take respectable people to no name city .
we can put up a few up at our place .
can you take the rest ?
have you got room in your cabin for a couple of invalids ?
ben' s bringing in her husband .
mrs fenty , this is mrs rumson .
i' m mrs fenty' s son , horton .
this is my sister laura sue .
here are some blankets .
keep warm by the fire .
i' il take care of the children .
your husband is a good man , mrs rumson .
yes , they are .
i said that husband of yours is a good man .
yes , thank you , mrs fenty .
don' t you worry .
the children went to sleep .
i' il see to mr fenty now .
thank you , mr rumson .
my name' s not rumson , ma' am .
that' s my wife' s name .
i' il bet that seems a little confusing , don' t it ?
a little , yes .
how is it you and your husband don' t have the same name ?
that' s easy to explain .
it is ?
ln the chinese section of town was the pagoda hell saloon , and upstairs there lived a real mandarin princess who invited me over occasionally for a little egg roll .
i' m entering to pray for the unfortunate victims .
parson , these folks have suffered enough .
why don' t you do that outside where god can hear better , cos i' il be talking in here .
you can' t talk to the parson that way in front of these people .
this is a nice , church going family .
go see where pardner is with the supplies .
yes , ma' am .
mr rumson , will you tell me the rest of the story after dinner ?
sure .
about 10 years after dinner .
i' il take care of your little sister .
you keep warm .
mrs rumson , if the other gentleman is your husband , who' s mr rumson ?
he' s my husband' s partner .
how is it you have his name ?
just a coincidence .
what are you talking about ?
elizabeth ain' t sick .
you listen to me .
she' s got a bad case of the respectabilities .
ln a few days she' il be burning up in a fever of virtue .
and then look out .
why ?
it' s been my experience that there' s nothing more ruthless and treacherous than a genuine good woman .
ben , you have to stay at atwell' s tonight .
what ?
i can' t tell them i' m living with two men .
i just can' t .
elizabeth , you ain' t making sense .
lf you want to be respectable , how come mr rumson has to move out while mrs rumson stays with another man ?
lf anybody leaves , it ought to be me .
you can' t .
i already told them pardner' s my husband .
tell them you' ve made a mistake .
it' s only for one or two nights .
it' il be six weeks before they can move !
only a farmer' s dumb enough to get froze and tough enough to survive it .
damn farmers !
ok , i' il sleep out .
where you going ?
to get my things .
i got ' em right here .
see you in the tunnels , ben .
you moving out , ben ?
no .
me , neither .
i guess there' s two kinds in the world .
people who move , people who stay .
ain' t that true ?
no , that ain' t true .
well , what' s true ?
oh , there' s two kinds of people ...
them going somewhere and them going nowhere , and that' s what' s true .
i don' t agree , ben .
that' s cos you don' t know what the hell i' m talking about .
i' m an ex citizen of nowhere , and sometimes i get mighty homesick .
i was born
under a wanderin ' star
i was born

willie , could you accommodate me for a couple of days ?
sure .
take your pick .
no .
i mean a room i can sleep in .
we don' t rent empty beds .
just till them sick farmers leave my house .
wait .
clotilde' s gone off for a while .
use her room .
what happened to clotilde ?
some bummer says if she don' t marry him , he' s gonna kill her .
she took off to let him simmer down .
she said she' d marry him .
he wants her to quit working .
that' s a narrow minded attitude .
she' s a fancy smeller .
damn farmers .
sugar , guess who this is ?
sugar , guess who this is !
by goom , i must have been down here too long .
you' re beginning to smell like a woman .
good morning .
good morning , mr rumson .
you' re an hour late .
who the hell' s the stranger ?
he won' t tell anybody .
he' s practically family .
just wanted to see what a gold mine looked like .
you open your mouth about this , i' il put a stick of dynamite in it .
you tell no one , do you hear ?
i swear before god .
i said no one .
start at end of number four .
work an extra hour to make up for being late .
how' s elizabeth ?
she' s fine .
we' d like to have you for dinner tonight .
ls that right ?
yeah .
6 : 30 . ls that all right ?
it' s mighty neighbourly , but i got to play the organ for the parson .
possibly some other time .
lf you' re one of the family , dig !
mr rumson , i swore i wouldn' t tell anyone .
i hope that means except my parents .
that means especially your mother and father .
i' ve never kept secrets before .
it' s about time you started , cos when you do , a whole new world opens up .
you got that kind of cold , empty feeling inside of you ?
yes .
do all gold miners get that ?
it' s very common .
what do they do for it ?
i' il show you .
are we going in a saloon ?
that' s where the medicine closet is .
it' s part of that whole new world i was telling you about .
after you , columbus .
gentle music fills the sky at no name city
and the days , they whisper by at no name city
sure , there' s not a spot as rare in all heaven or in erin
let me live until i die ln no name town
that' s good .
my first drink .
you feeling all right ?
yes , sir .
thank you .
that cold , hollow feeling is almost gone .
bartender , cigars .
thank you .
i' il bet that' s the strongest cigar you ever smoked .
it' s the first cigar i ever smoked .
it' s delicious .
you all right , mr rumson ?
fine .
why do you think my father is so dead set against saloons ?
cos farmers ain' t got the time to enjoy the good things in life .
farmer' s got a busy day ...
got to pull them turnips , talk about the weather .
that' s about as much as he can handle .
quiet !
who are they , mr rumson ?
they' re on the menu .
i don' t understand , sir .
you ain' t gonna tell me that you ain' t never had a woman , neither ?
no , sir , i haven' t .
that' s terrible !
do you know you could go blind ?
we got to do something about that .
i wouldn' t know what to do .
don' t worry .
with your talent , you' il catch on in no time .
willie , if you was to go trapping for the first time , who would you take along as a guide ?
that would be gracie .
she loves adventure .
grace , i give you the boy .
give me back the man .
that was the best .
you think so ?
i like smoking and drinking , but they can' t touch the last one .
that' s got everything .
most people' d go along with that .
well , good night .
mrs rumson will be sorry you' re not coming for dinner .
the last thing she said this morning was to be sure and bring you .
ln that case , maybe i will .
good .
i' il walk you home after .
remember , you wasn' t in no tunnels and wasn' t in no saloon .
i remember .
we thank thee , lord , for the two of these friends ...
shut the door .
for this we thank thee , lord .
amen .
will you wipe your feet off ?
evening , ben .
sit down .
evening , elizabeth .
well , pardner , you handled grace pretty good .
not as good as horton did this afternoon , but pretty good .
where have you been ?
gold mining .
your son' s the most natural born gold miner that i ever met .
i brought him up not to be afraid to try anything .
that boy tries everything .
did you know that the fentys had an apple farm back in pennsylvania ?
applejack ?
no , we did not make applejack .
then why grow apples ?
mr rumson , should everything from the earth be used for liquor ?
whenever possible .
you should read the bible .
i have read the bible .
didn' t that discourage you from drinking ?
no .
killed my appetite for reading .
we' ve been telling the fentys what good land' s all around here .
we' re thinking of settling here .
great !
that news is so god damn great , i need a drink .
don' t listen to him .
he' s always joking .
elizabeth , the whisky' s gone .
i know .
i poured it all out .
you what ?
out of courtesy to our guests .
lf you want a drink , get your carcass out of this house .
you can' t order a man out of his own house .
his house ?
that' s right .
it' s his house .
mrs rumson is married to him ?
she' s married to the both of us .
at the same time ?
well , we' re pardners .
i have never heard ...
shut up and sit down !
don' t order the guests around .
why not ?
it' s his fault .
without his respectability , we' d still be a happily married ... triple .
there' s not one drink of whisky ?
take mine .
thank you .
you saved my life .
horton , how did that bottle get into your pocket ?
how long have you been drinking ?
since this afternoon .
you don' t approve , but until you' ve had a good cigar and whisky , you' re missing two of the best things in life .
where' d you take him , ben ?
damn you , ben rumson .
what are you gonna teach this boy next ?
how to cheat at cards or physical education with some floozy ?
that' s the best one .
ls that what you did today , ben ?
that' s what he did today .
he' s got a talent for dissipation that is absolutely unique .
out .
get out !
i order you out of this house !
this is not your house !
this is my house !
that' s right .
i give her the house .
lf you cross this threshold again ,
i' il shoot you like any other marauder .
what' s she so het up about ?
she' s got a right to be .
you had to take your revenge on the virtue of this boy , show him what an ugly town this really is .
lf we live here , then we' re ugly , too .
i could never go back to what we had before .
it' s over and it' s done and it' s finished .
now get out .
wait . lf ben goes , i' d have to go .
then you go , too .
evening , ma' am .
good evening , ma' am .
you mutton headed clunk .
you knew she didn' t want them to know .
elizabeth' s a sick woman .
you got no respect for anybody or anything .
i don' t have your kind of respect , sitting there with your hands folded and that pious look on your face after a hard day' s thieving .
it ain' t thieving .
then why are we hiding it ?
why are we talking about it ?
she' s all alone .
whose fault is that ?
yours .
hers .
she threw us out .
don' t say anything against elizabeth around me .
i' il say anything i want .
she' s my wife , paid for , and don' t forget it .
i never do forget it .
i got nothing more to say to you .
you got nothing i want to hear !
lf i catch you sneaking back without me , they' il never find all of you to bury !
bull and bear fight !
bull and bear fight !
see the great bull that cut up the mountain lion in sonora and emerged triumphant over 10 large dogs !
save your souls , heathen scum !
allow this butchery to take place on sunday , and god will wash his hands of you !
thank you , parson .
now go .
god is gonna cause the earth to open and swallow up this nest of evil , and the lord ain' t fooling .
i hear strange rumblings in the earth below .
they ' sell a lot of tickets to the bull and bear fight on sunday .
a lot of gold dust is gonna fall .
but jack , we don' t have a tunnel under there !
you bloody maniac !
why didn' t you build one ? !
we can get under there by sunday .
there' s nothing to it .
maybe so .
but we could sure use a bit of help .
what about that young farmer ?
where' s he ?
horton fenty ?
little did i realise it , but when he set foot on the second storey of willie' s saloon , history was in the making .
ls that where he is ?
that' s where he always is !
puffing cigars , drinking , and knocking on doors .
lf he don' t slow down , them girls are gonna strike for shorter hours .
i' il see if i can catch him between rooms tonight .
lf we could divert his energy , we could be through by morning .
come on , bet .
i' il bet 50 .
i' il see that and raise you 50 .
not for me .
i' m out .
have you seen the future father of our country ?
yeah .
he went home .
when will he be back ?
soon as his folks are asleep .
tell him i want to see him .
leave your door open and wait your turn .
here .
pardon me , sir .
could you lend me $10 ?
why don' t you go home and go to bed ?
i was thinking of doing it the other way around .
thank you , sir .
i' il see your 50 .
red seven wins again !
pardon me .
here' s your $10 back , sir .
and 10 more .
red seven .
you' re losing a lot of money , pardner .
where do you get it all ?
thieving .
i would give the world to see how i used to be
when i had no axe to grind except for choppin ' wood
day was day , and night was night wrong was never right
it didn' t matter where i went as much as where i stood
i had dreams average size
there were stars ln the skies
not my eyes
then i got gold fever
no rompin ' , rollin ' girl and fellow stuff
can cure the gold fever
nothin ' can help you but the yellow stuff
what can stop that itchin '
ain' t around the kitchen
gold , gold , hooked am i susannah , go ahead and cry
once we all did honest work farmer , lawyer , clerk
married men and single men and some who ain' t too sure
now i look at them and see duplicates of me
cured of what we suffered from and sufferin ' from the cure
who can say why we came ?
where' s the hope ?
where' s the flame ?
we' re the same
when you' ve got gold fever
no rompin ' , rollin ' girl and fellow stuff
can cure the gold fever
nothin ' can help you but the yellow stuff
what can stop that itchin '
ain' t around the kitchen
gold , gold , hooked am i susannah , go ahead and cry
gold fever
gold fever
gold fever
gold fever
gold fever
deal .
by god , we made it .
now they can open the box office .
here' s your day' s earnings , ben .
and here' s yours , pardner .
tell ben something for me .
he' s right there .
just tell him that i' m moving on before winter sets in .
he can get himself another pardner .
you bummers can divide up anything i got coming here .
where you heading ?
red dog .
i hear they' re digging it up in chunks there .
by goom , they' re always digging it up in chunks somewhere else .
good luck , man .
thanks , jack .
tell ben to look in on elizabeth .
the fentys are pulling out .
she' il be alone .
you stinkin ' , rotten heathen scum !
silence , judas !
today is sunday !
and you are going to hear the word of god whether you like it or not !
get out of here !
and the word of the lord is doom !
set the bull on him .
you can' t do that .
let him out !
.. this town of lust and corruption !
get out of here .
out , out , out .
you are not going to fight that bear on the sabbath .
i represent the lord , and the lord says get out of this arena .
the lord will open the earth , and you will sink into the pit !
you hear ? !
i said , sink into the pit .
i said , sink into the pit !
i' il be god damned .
hello , parson .
welcome to hell .
though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death ...
you better run through that valley !
will you kindly watch where the hell you' re falling , my good man ? !
now where are you going ?
ach du lieber himmel !

gobble up this town and swallow it down
and goodbye to you
will you go to heaven ?
will you go to hell ?

i think this place is crumbling .
be calm , my dear .
pardner , where' s ben ?

i didn' t like that town , but it' il seem funny not having it there .
it' s gonna be a cold , long , hard winter without it .
i' m not leaving my home , pardner .
i know that .
do you have to go ?
can' t we all try living the way we used to ?
no .
no , i can' t .
you see , ever since that night the fentys came and we were ...
you and i were like a real husband and wife ,
i couldn' t live with you any other way .
and you belong to ben .
he shared you with me .
i didn' t share you with him .
ma' am ...
whoa , mule .

i don' t care where we go as long as i stay ahead of civilisation .

i can see this valley in a year .
broke out in white clapboard houses , schools , churches , courthouse , museum .
just one big , bad dream .
what about elizabeth ?
i' m gonna miss that woman .
but you can' t blast her out of that cabin .
funny , here we go and build a town just the way we like it , and then we go and sink it .
giddup , mule !
pull up , ben .
whoa , mule .
what' s the matter ?
i' m staying .

i always said you had a farmer' s mentality , but you' re still the best pardner there ever was .
you' re the only pardner that ever was .
that makes me the best .
you gonna say goodbye to elizabeth ?
no .
i don' t think i' il do that .
i' il get melancholy enough later on without picking up an extra load now .
you say something nice to her for me , par ...
what the hell is your name anyway ?
sylvester newel .
sylvester newel .
yeah , just one " l " .

under a wanderin ' star
wheels are made for rollin ' mules are made to pack
i' ve never seen a sight that didn' t look better lookin ' back
i was born

a million miles away send back the world
there' s too much night for me
the sky is much too high to shelter me
when darkness falls four cabin walls
would be just right for me
a million miles away

you want to see virtue left behind ?

sodom was vice and vice a versa
you want to see where the vice is worser ?
here it is i mean , here it is
you want to see life ln the rottenest way ?
here it is
women and whisky night and day here it is
you want to embrace the golden calf
ankle and thigh and upper half ?
here it is , i mean , here it is
i don' t know where am i headin ' ?
i ain' t certain
all that i know is i am on my way

susannah , go ahead and cry
a million miles away
