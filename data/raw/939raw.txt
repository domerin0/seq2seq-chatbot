so , you' re finally settling down .
you' ve saved up a little nest egg and are ready to dive into the real estate market .
let' s do a little shopping around .
the american dream home .
two bedrooms , two bathrooms , one doghouse , one garage , two garbage cans .
it' s cozy , safe , and just barely within your overstretched budget .
not for you ?
for the same price , you can buy 200 , 000 acres of prime sahara wasteland .
put up a cottage .
nothing but you and the sky .
it' s like a beach without the ocean .
and talk about quiet neighbours .
too remote ?
oh , i understand .
you need the thrill and excitement of the big city .
with that same nest egg , you can get a slice of prime real estate .
not this real estate .
cozy and affordable , this lovely fixer upper is the perfect place for a dynamic couple like you .
no need to putter around the house .
it' s all right there where you stand .
what' s the matter ?
feeling a little cramped ?
well , just a stone' s throw away , just one bridge or a tunnel ride , just outside the big , bustling city , there is a place with wide open spaces , friendly natives , and spacious dwellings .
and it' s all within your price range .
it' s almost too good to be true .
when i told you
i had a particular building in mind for you , this is the one i was talking about .
it' s a historical home on one of the best blocks in all of brooklyn .
remember what we talked about .
i know .
poker face .
built ins , built ins .
oh , the kitchen' s a little small .
well , rip out this awful room divider , and you' ve got an eat in kitchen .
and over here you have your library .
wow .
for your books .
oh , you like books ?
i have a little collection of first edition novels .
alex is a writer .
the parlor .
oh , my god .
so , this staircase .
this leads to where ?
i thought you realized .
this is a duplex .
as in two floors for the price of one ?
i believe it' s right there in the listing sheet .
so , why was it sealed off ?
were there , like , a slew of murders up there or something ?
no , there' s just a sweet , little old lady that lives upstairs .
a tenant ?
mm hmm .
so , rent control means we can' t kick her out , right ?
alex !
that' s a legitimate question .
you cannot evict her .
she has to decide to leave or , god forbid ...
poor thing hasn' t been feeling well lately .
she' s gotta be close to 100 years old .
mrs. connelly ?
it may take her a while .
she' s hard of hearing .
mrs. connelly ?
kenneth .
there' s my favorite girl .
how you feeling today , mrs. connelly ?
i don' t feel too good , kenneth .
oh , i' m sorry to hear that , mrs. connelly .
i brought by a young couple that may want to buy the apartment .
hi .
hi , mrs. connelly .
i' m nancy kendricks .
this is my husband , alex rose .
hello .
we were wondering if we could look around .
i don' t feel up to it .
i' m sorry , dear .
nice seeing you again , kenneth .
you have a mommy and me park over here .
you got shopping that way .
no traffic .
it is ideal .
here' s my card if you want to make an offer .
there' s a lot of heat on this place .
i' d say it' il be off the market by monday .
adios .
three fireplaces ?
guys , the place sounds incredible .
and surprisingly affordable .
it' s kind of affordable .
it' s really at the high end of our price range .
but when you factor in that it' s a duplex .
it' s a duplex ?
yes .
oh .
you know , it' s brooklyn , first of all .
we weren' t even thinking about brooklyn , so ...
oh , actually , which reminds me .
did you bring it ?
oh , yeah .
is this the latest in the don piper mystery series ?
fresh off the presses .
i inscribed this copy to you guys .
oh !
coop , thank you .
i am sure it' s not gonna be as brilliant as your new book , but a couple decent metaphors in there .
turn of phrase .
we forgot to tell them the big news .
oh , god .
yes .
what is it ?
go ahead .
we' re pregnant .
wow !
congratulations .
congratulations , man .
i' m so happy for you !
you guys must have just found out .
no .
unh unh .
i' m four months along .
yeah .
four months ?
mm hmm .
oop !
oh , honey .
stop .
hello !
i mean , we' re not gonna want to live here once we start having babies .
and that upstairs would make the cutest playroom .
well , i don' t want mrs. connelly coughing on my baby .
you know what i mean .
besides , do you realize how much the duplex is gonna be worth once we get both floors ?
i know how much it costs .
it' s gonna be worth a bazillion times that .
really ?
a bazillion ?
that' s an incredible return .
come on , alex , what better way to finish your novel than in your own 19th century oak writer' s nook ?
it would be nice not to write at starbucks with the other novelists .
because you deserve your own nook .
that' s my train .
all right .
let' s do it .
really ?
yeah .
aah !
oh , this is so wonderful .
we' re gonna have a home .
yeah .
all right .
i love you .
i love you !
i could have sworn we had more stuff .
it' s gonna look great .
mrs. connelly , it' s nancy kendricks and alex rose , from downstairs .
let me look at you .
oh !
hi .
we just wanted to come up and say hi .
oh , what a nice surprise .
come in .
come in .
thank you .
wow .
what an amazing apartment !
oh , thank you , dear .
sit down .
we brought you this little housewarming gift .
that' s very kind of you .
thank you .
i' il open it for you .
i don' t drink , myself .
it' s a sin .
irish catholics don' t drink ?
what are you doing ?
oh , i' m just taking a few little pictures for research .
if i knew you were coming , i' d have tidied up .
hey , nancy .
yeah ?
blow me down !
oh !
what did you say ?
are you all right ?
yeah .
oh , god !
i' m coming , slowly but surely .
i' il just turn off this music .
alex !
alex !
sit down , dears .
sit down .
i' ve brought you a little something to nibble on as well .
oh , bugles .
wow .
i didn' t realize they even still made bugles .
here you go .
that' s a magnificent parrot .
it' s not a parrot , dear .
he' s a macaw .
he' s named after my late husband , richard .
i' ve had little dick for 40 years .
come along , dear .
don' t be shy .
it' s french onion .
oh .
mrs. connelly , how are you feeling ?
why do you ask , dear ?
well , because the last time we saw you , you were quite ill .
oh , i had a bit of a cold , but i' m in fine fettle now .
tell me about yourselves .
what do you do , alan ?
alex .
alex is a writer .
oh , a writer .
hmm .
i always thought of that as more of a hobby than a real job .
i suppose i' m forgetting about joyce .
joyce .
james joyce .
of course .
wonderful writer .
he died drunk and penniless .
well , alex' s first novel was published in hardback , and he' s about to finish his second one .
oh , what' s it about ?
well , i like to call it an urban epic .
it' s about three generations of this family that own a printing press , and i tell a story .
that' s nice .
let me give you a refill .
big dick had the taste , too .
he was a seaman .
the drink took him from me in 1963 .
we' d been married for 58 years .
' 63 .
so , when are you two planning on having children ?
soon .
yeah , not for a couple of years .
you sound just like mr. connelly .
we never had any children .
it' s too late for me now .
oh , look at the time .
i had no idea it was so late .
oh .
the time' s rolled on .
we haven' t had a chance to see the apartment .
oh , dear , i' m afraid there' s no time now .
really ?
we must say good night .
oh , okay .
oh .
uh oh .
oh , no .
that was your ...
i think it' s your couch .
i think the chair ...
alex .
that was a little ...
come along , dears .
come along .
how could you ?
a macaw .
any long tailed , brightly colored parrot .
a macaw is a parrot .
i knew it .
don' t you think that as landlords , we have some legal right to see the back of her apartment if we want to ?
i mean , i' il look it up on the internet .
that' s what i' il do .
i wonder how old she is .
oh , my guess is that she' s somewhere between 95 and 105 .
she looked pretty good tonight .
yeah , she did .
she looked kind of healthy .
yeah .
that' s nice .
yeah .
hi .
hello , mr. peabody .
i saw myself in the mirror , and i thought it was my mother' s tush .
mrs. connelly ?
mrs. connelly ?
oh , yes ?
who is it ?
hi , it' s alex .
i was wondering if you could turn down your tv ,
' cause we can hear it .
oh , i fell asleep .
i' m sorry .
that' s okay .
i' il do that .
okay .
thank you .
no , starvin ' marvin , that' s my potpie .
cartman , you butt pipe .
this is the time of year to share .
oh , yeah , you' re right .
are you going to eat your peach cobbler ?
no , you don' t want all that .
why don' t you share it with me ?
everybody' s asking me about fiber .
in the next few minutes , you' re going to learn about an amazing ...
if i want a slimmer waist .
use it on carpets .
oxiclean seeks out organic stains .
there' s no more bald jokes .
i gotta go .
have a good day .
see you later .
and finish that chapter !
i will .
good morning , alex .
good morning , mrs. connelly .
i wanted to give you this back .
i won' t drink it , and i thought you might want it .
oh , thank you .
that' s nice of you .
all right , if there' s anything i can do for you , let me know .
there is one thing .
yeah , i' m sorry , i don' t hear anything .
it was very distinctive .
the pipes went bang bang bangity bang bang .
bang !
bang !
well , they' re not doing that anymore , or it stopped , so , i' il tell you what , though .
if you hear it again , come get me .
i' il take a listen .
oh , all right then .
it' s a deal .
ooh , alan , dear boy , i wonder ...
alex .
pardon ?
alex .
my name' s alex .
i know .
no , i think you said " alan .
oh , no , i don' t think so .
i don' t forget names .
could you give me a hand with the garbage ?
we don' t want to be feeding the mice .
what in heaven' s name are you doing with me drawers ?
now , i would move the pull quote just a teeny bit so that you' il have room to squeeze in the text .
you' re such a good squeezer , nancy .
that' s because , until yesterday ,
i lived in an apartment the size of a small child .
but look at the new place .
oh , my god !
isn' t it gorgeous ?
yes .
there' s , like , this living room/ parlor area .
nancy , did you finish the " celebrity scene " page ?
oh , tickety boo .
i don' t know what that means .
it means you' il have it soon .
well , if you mean i' il have it soon , why don' t you say i' il have it soon ?
tickety boo " is just confusing for everybody .
oh , mr. peabody .
how did that get in there ?
ohh .
alex ?
alex ?
hey .
hi !
hi .
how was work ?
oh , herman' s freaking out , as usual .
were you napping ?
no , i was just rearranging my book collection .
in the dark ?
and then i closed my eyes for a second .
just to think , and , you know .
is this dinner ?
mm hmm .
so , how was your nook ?
did you get , like , five or six million pages written ?
more like five or six words .
our upstairs neighbor had me doing chores for her all day .
really ?
yeah .
well , you just gotta set some boundaries .
just tell her you' re working .
she' il understand .
what is that ?
oh , i picked up a few things on the way home .
it' s an area rug .
do you love it ?
yes .
how much was it ?
it doesn' t seem to cover much of an area .
it was $200 or something like that .
i don' t really remember .
that was 200 bucks ?
yeah , but , you know , it' s a runner ,
' cause it goes in between the two rooms and then ties them together .
ooh , and look !
look , look , look , look , look !
it' s an original pablo flinch .
really ?
cool .
is it , like , a mayan guacamole bowl or something ?
it' s a stool .
here .
try it .
what are we , hobbits ?
it' s a water stain !
i told mr. rose the problem with the pipes this morning .
they were going bang bang bangity bang bang .
bang .
bang .
yeah , the whole bathroom could have explode .
471 bucks .
what time ?
you were here three hours ?
yeah .
sweetie , these were original tiles .
how could you not hear banging ?
sweetie , i was asleep !
napping , and in the middle of the afternoon .
shameful .
i' m not gonna pay for unauthorized repairs .
i did the work , my friend .
i can rip the pipes out of the wall .
what ?
i don' t know what you' re saying .
do it !
do it !
you do it .

i begged mr. rose to do something .
i was terrified , nancy .

mrs. connelly , just call me , okay ?
i gave you my business card .
alan , before i forget , it' s the first of the month .
right . $88 .
do you want to count it ?
remember , if she bothers you , just lay down the law .
be firm , but nice .
two positives , then a negative .
what is that ?
psychology .
don' t wait up for me .
i got to work late .
i love you .
i love you .
good morning , alex .
good morning , mrs. connelly .
i wondered if i could ask you a quick question .
right .
you know what ?
can i just say this to you ?
you know i' m working on a book , right ?
and this book is due in about three weeks .
and my editor is expecting it on her desk at that time , okay ?
it' s a contractual deadline .
i see .
so i have to be working on that book all the time here in my apartment , which is also my office .
it' s just like my office .
if i was a lawyer , and i went off to an office , you couldn' t knock on my door , ' cause you wouldn' t be there .
so let' s just pretend that i' m a lawyer , okay ?
this is my office , and unless it' s a really , really super important emergency , okay , between the hours of 9 : 00 and 6 : 00 , i' m not here .
i' m off , away in my office , okay ?
and then after 6 : 00 , i' m here , okay ?
i completely understand .
and i apologize for bothering you .
not at all .
okay , have a good day , all right ?
it' s just ...

of course , if you' re too busy ,
i can come back out of business hours .
oh .
no .

oh , that' s so nice .
you didn' t have to buy a copy .

and i hope you like it .

i mean , i can' t wait for you guys to see it .
it' s beautiful .
ooh , herman , get in here .

being a landlord doesn' t give you the right to enter your tenant' s premises anytime you feel like it .
i just wanted my friends to have a look see .
you were supposed to be at the church performing .
heavens no .
it' s next friday .
we' ve got a big week of practice ahead of us .
you terrified the poor woman .
mrs. connelly , you can press charges if you want .

they' re such a nice couple .
good night , now .

thanks for the party .
okay .
i got an award for this one .
she was supposed to be at church .
you can' t fire me because you got maced .

alex ?
oh .
oh , no , no , no .
there' s no napping right now .
you have to finish your book .
we need money .
i got fired .
yeah , i know .
i saw it .
oh , you saw it .
yeah .
it' s horrible .
my parents read this magazine .
now they know my penis is called mr. peabody .
it wasn' t my fault .
she was calling me when you were napping .
i wasn' t napping , for the 1, 000th time !
okay , maybe i took a nap at one point .
when did napping become against the law ?
honey , i can' t work here .
it' s impossible .
i' ve been trying .
i' ve written three pages in the last six weeks .
three pages .
the book is due on wednesday .
if we don' t hand in the book , i don' t know what we' re gonna do .
we can' t pay for anything .
the runners , the stools .
we can' t pay for the tangelo bowl you like .
we can' t pay for your little happy mug vase thing .
well , what if you got out of the house and went to write at , like , a starbucks or something ?
and what ?
you' re gonna stay here and try to find work while she has you running around doing things for her ?
doing all the little errands , the chores she asks you to do ?
i don' t think you could take it .
i mean , i love you , but , honestly ,
i' ve been there , and i don' t think you could take it .
i can take it .
i' il be fine .
nancy ?
hello , mrs. connelly .
nancy , dear .
i couldn' t help noticing that alex left the house this morning while you stayed home .
i was downsized from my job .
aw , i' m sorry .
but i' m sure it' s for the best .
let mr. rose get out there and bring home the bacon .
i always thought it was strange .
a husband staying home while you were out there providing .
well , he' s a writer .
writer .
the man naps more than a newborn pup .
what' s he writing about ?
sheep ?
is there something , mrs. connelly ?
oh , i guess you could say there was something .
i' ve got something on display in me kitchen .
that is not a mouse dropping .
it' s a raisin .
that is the leavings of a mouse .
it' s a raisin .
i sprayed it with lysol .
ohh .
and she puts on this sweet face , and she acts all innocent .
nancy , could you help me ?
i think i found the leavings of a mouse .
as if she didn' t know it was a raisin .
i know .
i' ve never designed religious leaflets , per se .
1 : 00 .
great , rabbi .
thank you so much .
nancy ?
okay .
nancy ?
nancy ?
are you down there ?
what is it , mrs. connelly ?
little dickey' s caught in the dumbwaiter shaft .
well , how did he get there ?
aaah !
oh , don' t hurt him .
oh , ooh , dickey boy .
oh , careful .
aah !
shame on you .
scaring a helpless , little macaw like that .
scaring a helpless , little macaw like that .
this is not going well .
i told you she' s a mean , crafty old lady .
at this rate , i' m never gonna finish the book in time .
damn rent control .
i wish we could just kick her out .
what if we tried being nice to her ?
maybe we could get her a gift .
a gift ?
yeah .
and ask her if she wouldn' t mind leaving .
we ask her ?
yeah .
just ask her ?
maybe it' il take a little begging , but nicely .
well , she might go for begging .
there' s a chart that shows what' s inside of each chocolate .
that' s all right , dear .
mrs. connelly , let me come right to the point .
alex and i are trying to have a baby .
i saw .
in the living room .

the thing is , when we do have our baby , we' re gonna need the upstairs .
i don' t understand , dear .
we' re willing to pay you something .
you want me to leave ?
don' t you think you' d be more comfortable with people who are more in your demographic ?
in sunny miami beach .
i' m irish .
i' d sizzle up like a sausage .
besides , this is my home .

the emerald isle , hmm ?
back to the old sod .

you were choking on a chocolate .
you choked on a chocolate .
oh .

oh .

the last thing i remember , i ate one of their chocolates .
and when i woke up , he was having his way .
and she was holding me down .
no , i was trying to save her life .
he stole me drawers once for sniffing .
that' s ridiculous .
she was choking on the chocolate , so i did ...
shut up !
we keep a list of people like you down here at the station .
the sexual predator list .
sexual predator ?
and to think they want to have children .
we should' ve just let her choke .
oh , i know .
what can i get you ?
listen , i got 12 hours to finish this book .
i was wondering if i could sit here and write all day .
be my guest .
thanks .
nancy .
i was going to ring you .
i' m afraid there' s a bit of a problem up here .
i have to go on a job interview , so i' il take care of it later .
oh , that' s okay .
i' il ring the rug man .
good .
knock it in .
knock it in good .
i don' t want to slip and break me neck .

this is the problem area here .
it' s loose as a dublin whore .
oh , go on , knock it in .
yes !
now , just knock it in .
go on , knock .
come on , use some elbow grease .
aah !
okay , i will .
you threw her down the stairs ?
no .
but i imagined it .
and i liked it .
i' m evil .
i' m a horrible , horrible person .
thank you .
come on , she' s practically ruined our lives .
it' s natural to have thoughts like that .
really ?
yeah .
i mean , i' ve even had a couple .
aaaah !
like what ?
just , you know , snapping her neck or electrocuting her .
you know , just beating her to death , decapitating her , drowning her , just , you know , bludgeoning her , in a humane way , but ...
dicing her up into little , little pieces .
but asphyxiating her first so she didn' t feel anything .
i' m glad you clarified that .
you' re evil , too .
i' m finished .
that' s what i am .
and it was incredible .
the last 60 pages just poured out of me .
let' s open that really great champagne and celebrate .
alex ? !
alex ? !

ooh !

a huge rat just ran under me cupboard .
oh , come .
come on , quick .

i' il pop the cork .
i' il be right back .
are you sure it was a rat , mrs. connelly ?
i saw its face .
you saw its face ?
all right , let' s see if we can' t find this big , bad rat .
you sure it might not have been a dust bunny ?
' cause sometimes they look rodent like .
aah !
the rat !
where ?
there !
oh .
oh , that' s not a rat .
that' s like a little field mouse .
alan !
your purse fell into the fire .
oh , no .

and now here' s tonight' s health watch .
a deadly virus has hit new york city .
doctors warn that this particular strain is extremely dangerous in children under 5 and especially to the elderly .
symptoms include high fever ,
symptoms include high fever , accompanied by nausea and violent diarrhea .
mr. rose ?
would you sprinkle some salt on the steps ?
they' re terribly icy .
you better not go outside then .
ow !
ow !
mother ...
a giant tow truck runs it over , followed by an s. u. v. that it was dragging .
alex , that' s horrible .
i know .
i know .
can you believe it ?
no , i can' t .
i tried to warn you , alex .
we' re canceling every contract that' s in breach .
in breach ?
i have the crushed powerbook .
i' m sorry , darling .
if you put as much energy into your work as you do into excuses , you might have made the deadline .
do you have the shark ?
yes , we do .
excellent .
i' m gonna have that , no bones .
hi .
how do you feel ?
like i' m knocking on death' s door .
well , look who' s here .
come in , both of you .
hi , mrs. connelly .
happy thanksgiving .
oh , thank you .
how are you ?
oh , i' m grand .
but how are the two of you ?
you look rather sallow .
no , no .
we' re fine .
we brought you some popcorn .
oh .
oh , how lovely .
i adore popcorn .
so does little dick .
so , did you have a nice thanksgiving dinner ?
oh , yes , dear .
that lovely italian lady in the post office brought me a sumptuous dinner .
the only problem is some of the carcass didn' t go down the disposal .
that' s ' cause you don' t have a disposal .
i don' t ?
it' s really stuffed up .
all right !
if you ask me , you two have got some sort of bug .
thank god officer dan took me to have a flu shot last week .
upchuck is a delicacy for little dick .
he' s salivating .
he' s salivating .
how much can we get , kenneth ?
that depends on how far you' re willing to drop the price .
first of all , you way overpaid .
and then you got that tenant .
you said she was a sweet old lady .
oh , i can' t imagine those words coming out of my mouth .
so you' re saying that we' re stuck in this hellhole ?
yeah .
unless you' re willing to take a huge , huge loss .
how huge ?
huge , huge .
we' re just totally screwed , right ?
yeah .
i would say screwed is apt .
do you think that jean would ever give you a second chance ?
no .
no , it' s over .
besides , how could i have time to rewrite my novel and still do my faithful servant duty to her as her little indentured servant person , her little butt boy ?
i mean , i got a lot of duties .
' cause she might need me to count grapes with her or help her fix her heater or go take her to the laundry .
or i gotta go help her clean her banana skins and i gotta go help her clean out her garbage or go and wipe her ass !
god forbid she should have any shit hanging off her ass !
alex .
no .
really .
' cause then i gotta run like a little bunny and i have to go up there and i gotta go wipe her little ass .
and then i have to go , " oh , good for you , mrs. connelly , for having such a nice , little poopy .
you got some poopy on your diapie ?
ooh , let me go and clean it off with my tongue !
excuse me , sir .
i mean , enough is enough !
excuse me .
off we go , dickey boy .
okay .
okay , come on .
we don' t have that much time .
i know .
she' s running errands .
that only gives us 12 hours .
you , there .
me , there .
a little salt in her sugar bowl .
hey , come check this out !
roger .
alex ?
tripped on the rug .
i' m all right .
you sure you know what you' re doing ?
i rewired the lamp in your office .
cool .
' cause if the shock doesn' t get her , a little bit of gas poisoning should .
out goes pilot one .
out goes pilot two .
an hour at 375 ought to do it .
did you remember to blow out the pilot for the oven ?
oh .
honey .
alex .
the stain is dripping on us .
i know .
isn' t it soothing ?
alex .
hi .
we got a water stain downstairs , so i got to look at the pipes .
what has happened to your face ?
oh , i just fell asleep in one of those tanning machines .
you look like a roast mutton .
how are you doing , mutton head ?
i' m almost done .
ah !
on the average , she gets up to change the channel 19 times a night walking this 48 inch footpath .
by the time she gets to the back end of that " hawaii five o " marathon , the acid should have eaten through the floorboards .
and we' il finally be happy .
it wasn' t our fault , officer dan .
you should find the plumber .
right ?
right .
you know , we might want to get a hotel room just in case .
sweetie , now that we have a hole in the ceiling ,
i thought maybe it could be a new place for the staircase to go .
yeah .
looks good .
where are you going ?
a little insurance .
alex , no !
not mr. peacock .
honey , mr. peacock' s gonna have to take one for the team , okay ?
that' s it .
she' s watching " riverdance .
i didn' t know people still watched " riverdance .
you know , this is actually harder than it looks .
holy mary and joseph !
i could have fallen right through .
the floorboards here , they' re rotten to the core .
awhile back she hired this russian guy to fix the pipes .
and i don' t know if you noticed , but there' s all this water damage that he left .
with all due respect to mr. " d " , alex , you were up here yourself fiddling with me pipes a few days ago .
fiddling with her pipes , huh ?
now , that' s another fine right there .
for what ?
you can' t plumb without a license in new york city .
plumb ?
i can' t plumb ?
are you sassing me , mr. rose ?
he' s not sassing you .
yeah , no , i' m not sassing you .
i' m not .
i didn' t think so .
' cause i know a city building inspector that eats chickenshit slumlords like you for lunch .
you got it ?
i get it .
you know , slumlord ...
and you' re gonna buy miss connelly a brand new tv .
in fact , miss connelly , i' m gonna pick it out myself .
oh !
could you get one of those clappy things ?
it makes my viewing so much easier .
it makes my viewing so much easier .
smoke .
smoke , smoke .
mesca .
loot , loot .
gun ?
what ?
gun .
gun ?
gun ?
so this is what it' s come to ?
i guess so .
i don' t think i' ve ever held a gun be ...
i think i' ve got everything i need here .
we' ve got an unlicensed gun charge , and then pending an investigation ...
it was an accident .
it' s my experience that wives don' t accidently shoot their husbands in the penis .
and as much as this particular man might deserve it , spousal abuse is a very serious crime in this state .
you two have a good night now .
he thinks you' re abusing me .
well , you did shoot me .
you' re very lucky .
your hand deflected the bullet away from the tissue of the actual organ and just nicked the scrotum .
what about the , you know , the berries ?
oh . wake up , wake up , wake up , wake up  oh , baby , now , let' s get down tonight
you feel that ?
yes .
mm hmm .
that' s good .
okay .
i' m gonna run a few more tests , but i think you should be out of here by tomorrow .
poor mr. peabody .
he took one for the team .
i just think that we' re going about this murder thing all wrong .
you think ? !
maybe we should just keep it simple .
maybe we should just keep it simple .
this is so not simple .
yeah , but you know she triple chain iocks the front door at night .
a little more , a little more .
okay .
where is she ?
maybe she' s in her chair .
you caught me .
i can' t help but sneak a fag once in a blue moon .
we ...
we thought that you might be cold , so we brought you an extra pillow .
oh , such consideration .
so unlike the other landlords .
many have passed through the dwelling below , but i just know you two have come to stay .
officer dan put in me new television .
52 inches .
and he gave me these noise boxes , there and by me chair .
so it' s like i' m in the cinema .
oh , it' s going to be so wonderful here .
you two lovelies ... me ...
officer dan .
we' re going to be one big , happy family .
the irish have a saying that it' s unlucky to come in one door and go out of another .
something to do with the dead .
evil spirits and the like .
good night now .
do you know what , dears ?
i think i' ve enough warmth as it is .
night .
that was , without question , the weirdest 7 minutes of my life .
captain connelly battled waves twice the size of that !
didn' t he , little dick ?
we' re just gonna be one big , happy family !
what ? !
is it us ? !
are we doing such a bad job of trying to kill her ? !
it' s not our fault !
she' s a freak of nature !
hey !
i thought you were supposed to get rid of these .
i did !
it' s strange .
i don' t know how that got there .
yeah , right .
ass patrol " !
hand me that " ass patrol .
now , depending on her mood , she could be watching tv over here or sneaking a cigarette over there .
i realize this is just horribly cluttered .
when we get in there , we' re gonna go for a cleaner look .
it' s ...
sorry .
what' s the easiest way into this hag' s place ?
well , we found the dumbwaiter to be rather effective .
yeah , and you really don' t have to pull that hard to climb it .
you know , we could even leave the back door open for you .
so , chick , how much is this gonna set us back ?
25k .
o ... 2 ...
okay .
' cause we had had a slightly different figure in our heads .
we were thinking maybe something a little closer to , like ... half a " k.
the bottom line price for wet work is $25, 000 .
okay .
when do you think you could do it ?
i' il do it thursday night .
christmas eve ?
yeah .
i got a little function .
then i' il swing by .
put the cash in the dumbwaiter .
got it ?
got it .
okay .
cool .
don' t forget your computer .
thank you so much .
good night .
okay , now all we need is $25, 000 .
piper grabbed the leash of the only partner he' d ever known , and the private eye and his jack russell headed downtown .
' i guess it' s just one of those things worth killing for , huh ? " '
we' il take a break and come back for some q& a.
dental surgery . $25, 000 ? !
the thing is , with nancy losing her job , and with the mortgage and now with me losing my book contract , things have gotten desperate , and i wouldn' t even be asking if it wasn' t serious .
did you get the money ?
no .
he didn' t think i needed it .
but i did get a nice , new , signed first edition for my collection .
he wrote it in 4 days .
want to know how ?
listen to this .
let' s see .
her hair was bright yellow
like the color of your pee after you take a multivitamin .
it' s a nice metaphor , asshole !
stupid , freaking asshole !
i hate you and your stupid don piper mystery and your stupid pregnant wife who' s gonna have a little baby that has a freaking six pack because its mother never eats !
honey .
honey , we' re gonna get that money .
how ?
how are we gonna get $25, 000 in two days ?
it' s beginning to look a lot like christmas
no .
not mr. peacock .
take a look in the five and ten  glistening once again  with candy canes and silver lanes aglow  it' s beginning to look a lot like christmas  christmas  toys in every store  ooh  but the prettiest sight to see  is the holly that will be  on your own front door

do you think she' s up in heaven ?
well , i' il tell you something .
wherever she is , she' s in a better place .
you should have seen their faces when i said she was a goner .
so cheap , though i wish i could have been there .

it wasn' t easy holding me breath all that long .
next time , i want a bigger cut of your commission , kenny .

but did they live happily ever after ?
well , read the book .
