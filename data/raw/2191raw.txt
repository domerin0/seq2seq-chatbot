we shall be a ghost ship .
captain .
the men are hungry .
the food is contaminated .
give them whateveryou have in tins or in foil .
and give them red wine to slow the rate of radiation absorption .
very well , captain .
captain , in here , it' s only five units .
but in the reactor room , it' s ten times that .
turn off the ventilation system .
all compartments , shut down main ventilation .
captain , ifwe
we' il run the boat with skeleton crews .
put the men on top ... as far away from the radiation as possible .
we' re 1 60 kilometers from the nato base in jan mayan .
we could go there , get help from the americans .
under no circumstances ... will i abandon my boat or my crew to the enemy .
what is your plan ?
we' re out of radio contact .
ifwe stay on our course ... fleet command will send the diesels to find us .
radiation levels are rising too fast .
we' re just running on electric motors .
there' s no time for that .
they will find us .
as usual , the captain leaves no room for doubt .
good .
you' re fine .
good .
you' re fine , yevgeny .
next .
good .
yes .
next .
icons ... are forbidden .
contact bearing 0 1 5 .
range 2, 000 meters , captain .
wait , wait .
wait , wait !
wait , wait !
they' re americans .
captain .
the jackals have found us .
it' s an american destroyer .
captain .
the americans are contacting us on the emergency band .
the helicopter' s reported our men on deck .
the captain is offering assistance .
tell them we don' t require assistance .
we' re just getting some air .
what are they doing ?
taking pictures of us .
hey !
hey , spies !
take a look at this !
hey , you take a look at this !
everybody !
look at this lovely , lovely boat .
hey !
hey !
offering assistance .
they want this boat .
what a victory that would be .
the waters here are over a mile deep .
we could get the men off , scuttle the boat .
they' d have to take us .
captain polenin is right .
we have the life rafts .
we can save everyone .
scuttle the flagship of the fleet ?
present my crew to the americans for interrogation ?
your duty now is clear , captain .
you must save their lives .
my duty is to defend the state ... and i will do that to my last dying breath .
you' re defending nothing but your own ambition .
tell that to the men who are dying down there .
tell them .
there will be no more talk of surrendering to the americans .
it is treason .
you mention it one more time ...
i will have you confined to your quarters .
and you , you are the commissar ... representative of the party , responsible for crew morale .
yes , captain .
then act like it .
the crew need you to show courage , not fear .
fear is contagious .
yes , captain .
yes , captain ?
stop monitoring the americans .
they are the enemy .
yes , captain .
help me .
please .
how are the men ?
how would i know ?
i don' t know the first thing about radiation sickness .
please .
i' m giving them aspirin .
and i' m trying to prevent those that are dying ... from irradiating those of us that still have some hope .
pull yourself together .
you are an officer in the soviet navy .
go back and tell them that they' re improving .
as you say , you know nothing about radiation sickness .
perhaps they are .
captain .
yes ?
readings are rising in every compartment now .
comrade suslov .
what is it ?
the radiation is going to kill us all .
the political branch gives you the authority ... to approve any change of command .
only in extreme cases of dereliction of duty .
which this is .
he' s suffering from radiation poisoning himself .
his judgment' s impaired , or he would get the men off the boat .
when the moment comes , we will know it .
the weld is giving way !
the core temperature is 450 degrees and rising .
captain .
the reactor repair has failed .
captain .
core temperature is 450 degrees and rising .

we took their oxygen for the reactor team .
give the fire team some time .
activate the system .
the primary was never connected .
it has to be activated locally .
go to nine and turn on the system .
you refuse my order ?
i' il do it myself .
you leave the command center , i will get help from the americans ... and you will be in no position to stop me .
ifwe can' t handle it , i' il switch on the system myself .
get the fire out .
and quickly !
why aren' t we diving ?
under the authority given to me by the party ... you are hereby removed from your post for dereliction of duty .
isolate electrical !
you' re wasting time .
get a team to repair the reactor .

captain polenin , i have exercised my authority ... to transfer the boat to your command .
you' re our captain and always have been .

captain polenin , it' s treason !
the fire in compartment ten has been extinguished .
the suppression system was not required .
unfortunately , there was only one survivor .
thankyou .
captain .
captain .
we have to dive .
this is the captain .
don' t order them , captain .
ask them .
this is the captain .
our situation is desperate .
the reactor repair has failed .
at any moment , we could have an explosion ... which could set off the warheads .
this would destroy the american ship ... only a few kilometers ... from the nato base .
given the current level oftensions ... between our countries ... this could result in horrifying retaliatory attacks ... on the motherland .
we could dive ... and attempt to repair the reactor .
there are no guarantees .
i am standing by .
secure both bulkhead doors .
compartment ten isolated .
compartment nine clear ofsmoke ... manned and ready .
compartment eight serving the soviet union , comrade captain .
compartment seven standing by to do our duty , comrade captain .

yes , vadim , the weld is holding .
you' re a hero , vadim .
do you hear ?
you are a hero .
you are all ... all of you ... heroes .
i had hoped one of our own boats would find us .
the radiation levels are rising too quickly .
i have asked the american captain ...
for his help .
prepare to abandon the boat .
american destroyer , bearing 0 4 5 .
range , 2, 000 meters .
captain , i have a contact !
what the  captain !
the boat could be in trouble .
what sort of trouble ?
i' ve known captain vostrikov personally for half his life .
there isn' t a submariner in the navy whose loyalty i trust more .
more than his father' s loyalty ?
i never knew his father .
captain .
captain .
when my father went to sea ... he used to carry these ... great handfuls of dirt in his pockets .
a bit of the motherland , " he said .
he would rather die than betray his country .
contact me from the bridge when the last lifeboat is loaded .
i' il sink the boat .
the americans won' t get her .
that won' t be necessary , captain .
our submarine , s270 , has found us .
yes .
yes .
confirm and out .
reply from moscow , captain , sent through s270 .
your request to remove the men from the boat ... is denied , comrade captain .
they' re sending a freighter to tow us back to base .
anything else ?
they said
they said to give the men plenty of fresh fruit .
i want my men off this boat .
i am countermanding moscow .
you know that it will be the end of your career .
they' il send you to the gulag , like your father .
well , it' s a family tradition , isn' t it ?
let' s go !
let' s go !
come on !
we' ve got you .
easy .
easy .
good .
good man .
good .
you must be decontaminated .
do you understand ?
we must make you clean .
scrub him .
it' s cold .
you' il be warmer inside .
you must take your clothes off .
we will decontaminate you and destroy the clothes .
then you can go down below .
take off your pants .
easy .
back this way .
watch the rope .
pass it over .
come on , pull it .
be careful there .
this is your boat , misha .
i lost my position , yuri , but not my self respect .
you lost both .
where am i going ?
bring a blanket here .
they' re taking you across , vadim .
i need my picture of kataya .
where is it ?
in my pocket .
here you are .
there it is .
i can' t see .
i can' t see her .
all men accounted for , captain .
come on , come on .
give them here .
why didn' t you take command when you had the chance ?
because what they did was wrong .
prepare the tow , captain .
captain .
move all these men out .
move .
move back .
lev , you' re a welcome sight .
moscow thought you were defecting with your boat .
they want me to make a list of the men who are fit enough to testify .
testify ?
about what ?
about you .
make sure all the lines are secure .
come on .
you' re going home .
thankyou , doctor .
we did it .
we' re going home .
let' s keep moving .
keep moving .
yes , come on now .
let' s go home .
at every stage ofthis disaster , which came within moments ... of being a far greater disaster ... the officers and crew did what had to be done .
seven are now dead ... and nobody knows how many more are dying ... or how fast .
these are the men who returned home to be interrogated ... as if a crime had been committed ... questioned even when undergoing treatment for radiation poisoning ...
iocked up and denied access to wives and families .
but they and their comrades saved k 19 .
and maybe ... just maybe , they saved all of you as well .
thank you , captain polenin .
one thing more , please .
thank you .
no captain in the soviet navy has ever been faced with such decisions the fate of the boat , the crew ... the fate of the world ... all in the balance .
the navy is my life .
and one thing i know , there can be only one captain of a ship .
the burden of command is on his shoulders ... and his alone .
none of you
none of you has the right to judge captain vostrikov .
you weren' t there .
i was .
he was our captain .
he was my captain .
and it would be an honor ... to sail under his command again .
east germany has agreed to do ... what the west has been demanding it should do for more than a generation .
after opening up the berlin wall , the government has now announced ... it will hold democratic elections . it will hold democratic elections .
you' re not so tall as i remember .
it' s good to see you .
and you .
please .
i' m glad you found me ... but today was , in fact , not very convenient .
no , no .
it had to be today .
your crew .
it was 28 years ago today .
captain , a toast .
to the men still on patrol .
for their courage , i nominated these men ... for the title hero of the soviet union .
but the committee ruled ... that because it was not wartime ...
because it was merely an accident ... they were not worthy of the title hero .
what good are honors from such people ?
these men sacrificed ... not for a medal ... but because , when the time came ... it was their duty ... not to the navy ... or to the state ...
but to us ... their comrades .
and so ... to comrades .
to comrades !
