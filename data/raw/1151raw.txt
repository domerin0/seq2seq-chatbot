the little bloke shoots the big bloke .
he' s right , sir .
i' m leaving because there' s no point carrying on .
lf i' ve got steven downing to read a book , there' s no challenges left .
my career can only go downhill .
better be about the book , robert .
no , sir .
it' s about alan smith .
yeah , well , later .
what about him ?
mr ashworth , have you got a moment ?
sorry , but the noise from here makes it impossible to concentrate next door .
you' il get used to it .
i don' t want to get used to it .
i want to do some work , not listen to moronic football chanting .
qulet !
out !
out !
hold your hands up in the air !
offside !
linesman !
you' re the linesman !
my god !

jesus , doesn' t matter .
that' il do for today .
right .
see you tomorrow , sarah .
all right .
i was the naive , stupid new teacher , you were the cynical old hand ?
what ?
the snorting when i asked a question .
i was reading the football reports .
i never listen at staff meetings .
this has got to be a pose , this football stuff .
you pretend to be a yob for a bit of street cred ?
ls this ' cause my kids were enjoying their lesson ?
well , all kids enjoy a riot .
actually teaching them something is a lot harder !
i' ve seen this film .
you end up shagging on the carpet .
lf we end up shagging on the carpet ,
i will buy you a new carpet .
yeah , right .
but i tell you ...
i knew it !
no .
no carpets .
he is an english teacher .
oh , god , not all this again .
i mean , what about patrick swayze ?
no one cares whether he read byron or not .
and you know , he is the full axminster .
i' d want a brain as well .
eventually .
i' m gonna measure up .
i' m off to habitat first thing .
lf we end up shagging , you can carpet the whole house .
the walls , the ceiling , the garden ...
well , what' s she like ?
one of those women if you like football , you must be a yob .
bollocks .
ls she fit ?
not that you' d prove her point or anything .
what ?
what ?
what have i done ?
it' s a perfectly reasonable , straightforward question .
she' s not unattractive , but so what ?
a ) she hates me , b ) i hate her , and c ) what' s the point of all that ?
waste of fucking time .
ooh , sounds promising , then .
it must be terrible being that miserable .
pretending you only care about football results because the world' s a terrible place and what' s the point of it all ?
what ls the point ?
maybe it ls football results .
don' t worry .
he' s a sad , lonely bastard .
who cares what made him that way ?
where' s your brother ?
eh ?
he' s over there .
oi , number nine !
you' re a donkey !
didn' t he have a trial with someone once ?
yeah .
orient .
they offered him a contract , as well .
what happened ?
turned it down .
stupid sod .
said it was too risky .
what' s he doing now ?
er , runs his own business .
computer something .
he' s on about fifty grand a year .
i' d swap fifty grand a year
for a contract with orient .
so would l .
don' t even like orient .
neither do l .
he gets it both ways .
gets fifty grand a year , gets to play at a place with floodlights .
floodlights and a tea bar .
i' d love to play at a place with a tea bar .
yeah , well ...
bit late now , eh ?
dunno .
stanley matthews played first division football till he was fifty .
bet you any money you like
you' re not playing first division football
when you' re fifty .
it' s the smoking .
it' s not the smoking , steve , it' s the crapness .
pass the ball !
penalty !
yes !
hold that .
i' ve always wanted to do this .

anthropologists have always had a hard time with football .
the trouble is , you can only see what' s on the outside .
but there ls an inside , believe it or not .
we all have our reasons for loving things the way we do .
hey !
he' s here !
thanks for being so helpful .
ready ?
he' s been ready for hours .
no , i haven' t .
yes , you have .
what time will you be back ?
er , six .
six thirty .
fine .

ok ?

see you later , sunshine .
we' il do something special next time , huh ?
you looking forward to it ?
what ?
the match .
yeah .
sounds like it .
i' m not really a football fan .
no .
one day we' il find something you do wanna do .
your mum seems in good form .
yeah .
she ok ?
not really .
the last home game , last season ?
what about it ?
they were fucking rubbish .
fucking rubbish last year and the year before .
they' il be fucking rubbish this year , too .
and next year .
and the year after that .
i don' t know why you come , frank .
you live in hope .
what d' you reckon ?
think they' re bad as frank says ?
this is his first time .
hope he knows what he' s lettin ' himself in for .
have a look at the number eight .
jon sammels .
remember his face and if you happen to bump into him , tell him to sod off to spurs !
programmes !
programmes !
go on , give it a shove .
someone hasn' t been eating their greens .
wey hey !
we' re in " y " , ok ?
yeah .
what d' you reckon ?
when' s the next game ?
week after next , probably .
let' s have a look .
yeah , sunderland .
they' re away at leeds next week .
can we come to the sunderland game , dad ?
you might wanna go somewhere different .
lf you' re gonna be a football fan , think carefully about who you' re gonna follow .
look .
for fuck' s sake , arsenal !
get it !
sammels , you' re a fucking idiot !
sort yourself out !
that was a brilliant goal , wasn' t it , dad ?
it was pretty good , yeah .
what happened ?
it was a penalty , the goalie saved it then the man who missed the penalty had another go and scored .
terry neill ?
that' s right .
he' s good , isn' t he ?
fantastic .
i' m off , then .
see you next week .
let' s go .
come on .
why do we have to leave ?
beat the traffic .
long walk back to the car , we' il be stuck for hours .
but they might score again .
there' s a remote possibility .
but it won' t be this afternoon .
joke . lf you' re an arsenal fan , you get used to jokes like that .
i will .
who d' you think played best ?
dunno .
but sammels was rubbish .
i don' t think so .
crowd didn' t understand what he was trying to do .
they were on to him before he' d done anything wrong .
i disagree .
oh , you do ?
one afternoon at football , you' re kenneth wolstenholme .
who did you think played the best ?
might make an arsenal defence of them yet , robert .
yes , sir .
em , sir , you going to highbury next week ?
nah .
oh .
' course i' m going .
want me to get you a programme ?
it' s cash in advance .
i' ve been caught too many times .
no , it' s not that .
em ... could i come with you ?
that' d be a bit difficult .
to be honest , between you and me ,
i go to the pub first .
i could wait outside .
i stand on the north bank .
you wouldn' t see .
i' d go down the front .
your mum' d love that .
she says i have to go with a responsible adult .
saturday' s the one day of the week when i' m not a responsible adult .
i turn into someone your age .
not as sensible .
she won' t have to find out .
i' m sorry , robert , i can' t .
well , not this week .
maybe some other time , eh ?
next season when you' ve grown a bit ?
get you a programme .
cash in advance unnecessary , on this occasion .
to hell with it , you can have one for free .
thanks , sir .
bollocks !
bollocks !
nothing to worry about .
his handwriting' s a disgrace to the human race but he' s very bright and enjoys the lessons .
he does .
he' s always goin ' on about you .
it' s my enthusiasm for steinbeck' s prose style .
either that or something else .
the football , you mean ?
robert thinks they might win the championship for the first time since 1 970 .
1 971 .
gotta get things like that right .
absolutely .
did he tell you what happened after football training ?
he asked me if i' d take him to the arsenal .
mr ashworth , i' m so sorry .
he just seemed uptight about it .
his dad and me are recently separated .
it was his dad he used to go with .
you don' t wanna take him ?
don' t know anything about it .
i very much doubt if he' d care .
i can tell you everything you need to know in about five minutes .
she seemed to enjoy the elizabethans but when we moved on , she slipped back .
she dropped four places .
was it four ?
no , six .
which i found a little disappointing though i' m not sure that she did .
no .
she' s got her heart set on a hairdresser' s apprenticeship .
right .
thanks very much , then .
you come out the tube station , cross over the street and in that entrance there , you buy unreserved seats , 7 .
my ex can pay .
he' s a spurs fan , isn' t he ?
yeah .
i' d go for 1 2 seats .
sting the bastard for all you can get .
thank you so much .
you' ve been really helpful .
hello , mr johnson .
how are you ?
evening .
suppose you' re feeling pretty pleased with life .
# are you ready to be ... heartbroken ?
oh , fuck it !
# well , you better get ready now , baby
would you like a lift ?
# get ready to bleed
you don' t know where i live .
yes , i do .
crouch end .
it' s on my way home .
' don' t forget , i' il be back
' with all the top sports stories ...
' but first of all ... '
how about you ?
arsenal .
lnside the stadium or just nearby ?
' number one ,
' abigail' s party ,
you really are mr popular , aren' t you ?
all those queues at your desk . ' .. live commentary
' on three races from that meeting . '
sorry .
' and the main one at 3 . 45 .
' now the main sports stories . '
what were you talking to robert parker' s mother about ? ' .. suspended arsenal' s paul davis ... '
shit !
fuck !
bollocks !
i' m sorry ?
paul davis .
who' s paul davis ?
arsenal .
were we talking about him ? ' .. signed a four year contract ... '
sorry .
i wasn' t listening . ' .. olympic headlines from seoul ,
' linford christie' s given the all clear ... '
arsenal .
yes , you said .
no , i was talking to robert parker' s mother about arsenal .
god !
i' m in the wrong job .
well , i' m in the wrong life .
i spent hours preparing for a parents ' evening .
no one could think of two words to say to me .
yet they queue for hours to hear your pearls of wisdom on next week' s game against wolves united !
yeah ...
just wolves .
no united .
look , i' m sorry .
it must seem unfair .
yes , it does , actually .
it' s the next left .
maybe you' re too uptight with them .
maybe you should just ... be yourself more .
all those files and folders and what have you .
that ls me being myself .
it' s just here .
d' you want a cup of coffee ?
ok .
you don' t have to .
no , no , no .
i' d ...
yeah , i' d like to .
what are these for , then ?
they' re not for anything .
they just look nice .
are they yours ?
no .
jo' s .
my flat mate .
it' s her place .
she' s away at the moment .
can i smoke ?
no .
you can stay the night , though , if you want .
not on the carpet .
i can' t afford it .
you might have the decency to run .
then we wouldn' t be doing it together .
cocky cow .
it' s just a fact .
look .
ok !
ok !
i hate you !
i owe you a new carpet .
well , maybe a new spare bed .
you shagged the football hooligan !
i knew it !
i knew it !
he' s not a football hooligan .
so he has read byron ?
he' s bound to have done !
it doesn' t really matter if he hasn' t .
who' d have thought it , eh ?
lron knickers " hughes ending up with a yob .
he' s not a yob and i' m not ending up with him .
you wanna bet ?
where are you off to ?
i' m starving .
i was thinking of ringing for a pizza .
have you read byron ?
what ?
have you read any of byron' s poems ?
yeah .
the assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold
and his somethings were gleaming
in black and old gold . " crap .
what are those ?
my ... arsenal boxer shorts .
they' re not my best ones .
i was running out .
but you' re willing to show them to another human being .
i wasn' t exactly showing them to you .
what d' you wanna know about byron for ?
um ... a bet .
did you win ?
i don' t think so .
stay in line !
right , now push up !
out !
out !
that' s it !
good lads .
offside , referee !
offside !
ref !
oi , ref , he was miles off .
it' s not m y fault .
too good a coach for this level .
what' s the score ?
one all .
lf you count that poxy goal they just scored .
what' s this , cup or league ?
cup , quarter final .
how long left ?
fifteen .
i wanted to talk to you about a vacancy .
rosie hunter' s handed in her notice .
i wondered whether you' d be interested in applying .
head of year ?
um ... well ...
obviously not the most attractive offer you' ve ever had .
come on , ben !
get back with him !
sorry , ted .
i haven' t fired you with enthusiasm .
it' s a lot of work .
what do i wanna do more work for ?
more money ?
i' ve got enough to pay my rent , enough for my season ticket and a couple of records a month .
got no family .
i' d like you to think about it .
sorry .
there' s nothing to think about .
come on , sam !
put it away !
yes !
why aren' t adults supposed to go mad about anything ?
you' ve got to keep a lid on it .
and if you don' t , then people are apparently entitled to say what they like .
you haven' t grown up , you' re a moron .
your conversation is trivial and boorish .
you can' t express your emotional needs .
you can' t relate to your children and you die lonely and miserable .
but you know , what the hell ?
every cloud has a silver lining .
not on your own .
how many more times ?
you' il have to wait until your father' s over .
so i' il get to highbury five times a year ?
it' s not my fault your father lives abroad .
mum , they play 21 times a year plus cup matches .
that' s ...
mum , why is crossroads a motel ?
what d' you mean ?
why isn' t it just a hotel ?
29 ! lf they get to the league cup semi final , the fa cup quarter final ...
you can take your car there .
you forgot europe .
i don' t know how many games last season .
oh , yeah .
that' s another five games .
that hotel in devon , we took our car .
every round is home and away .
we had to leave it in the car park .
fives into thirty five goes seven .
one seventh of all the home games .
pathetic !
paul , in a motel , you drive a car into a room !
say you only went to one seventh your choral society
they' d throw you out .
arsenal won' t throw you out .
they want your money .
i' ve looked it up .
i can catch the 1 2 . 53 to paddington , be at paddington by 1 . 36 , get the circle and district and metropolitan line to kings cross .
then it' s caledonian road , holloway road ,
arsenal , third stop .
be there 2 . 1 5 , easy .
for christ' s sake , go if you want to .
yes !
thanks , mum .
charlie , charlie ,
charlie , charlie ,
charlie' s the king of highbury .
don' t come runnin ' to me if you get stabbed to death .
i won' t .
jimmy husband !
brilliant .
it' s not easy to become a football fan .
it takes years .
but if you put in the hours , you' re welcomed , without question , into a new family .
except in this family , you care about the same people and hope for the same things .
what' s childish about that ?
a terrible foul by mclintock on rocastle .
he' il be lucky to stay on the pitch .
it wasn' t that bad .
it was mistiming , it wasn' t malicious .
bollocks !
so , that' s a free kick to 1 989 arsenal and ... davis takes it .
and ...
goal !
and that' s 1 989 arsenal four , 1 971 arsenal , nil .
bob wilson will be bitterly disappointed with that one .
this lot would never beat the double team four nil at subbuteo .
it' s just i' m crap at it !
should' ve chosen someone else .
who else played in yellow and blue away strip ?
everton ?
be everton , then .
ok .
but this game' s abandoned .
i can' t start suddenly pretending that john radford' s joe royle .
it' d do my head in .
have to start again .
nil nil .
all right .
go on , then .
yes !
what are you thinking about ?
oh ... stuff .
what stuff ?
i was thinking about dh lawrence , actually .
yeah ?
what about him ?
well ...
well ... about his books .
what about his books ?
just ... which one' s the longest .
and ?
l i couldn' t remember .
well , which one did you think it might be ?
that' s just it .
i couldn' t decide .
between what and what ?
mm ...
well , " lady chatterley' s lover " ...
and ... ?
and , um ...
i wasn' t thinking about dh lawrence at all .
you amaze me .
i was thinking about arsenal .
i' m staggered .
we might win the league this year .
we' re half way through the season and we' re top and they' il fuck it up but ...
you' re not impressed , are you ?
i am .
i hope they win the league .
it' s just that ...
why did you lie ?
i' ve got to vary the answers .
i can' t say arsenal every time .
i can' t find any ... " bread " .
do i look like the sort of man who' d have a " bread " album ?
no , you look like the kind of man who has a " bollock brothers " album .
i wouldn' t put that on .
it' s a bit ... not the right mood .
oh ?
and what' s the right mood ?
well , i don' t know , just ... something ... you know .
what ?
you know , just ... something not as ... sweary and loud .
paul , that' s the most romantic thing you' ve ever said to me .
shut up .
by the way , congratulations .
on what ?
two nil .
quinn and dixon .
goal in each half .
top of the league .
nine games to go .
george graham sees no reason why arsenal shouldn' t bring the title back to highbury for the first time in 1 6 years .
1 8 years .
i' m sure he said 1 6 .
oh , right .
maybe i' m wrong .
yeah , ok , ok .
1 8 .
whatever .
so , when does it all end ?
may .
and what happens then , in the summer ?
just sit in the park and wait for the fixture list to come out .
so what about this summer ?
that' s a good point .
we might be in the charity shield .
that isn' t the point i was making .
we' ve been ... seeing each other well , we' ve been sleeping together for six months now .
and we' ve never even planned a holiday together .
it' s a miracle if we plan a weekend before friday afternoon .
and yet you know what arsenal are doing for months in advance .
they produce a fixture list .
well , i can do that for you .
give me your diary and i' il put some dates in it .
don' t be daft .
what' s daft about it ?
i don' t really see the difference .
how about saturday , october the 8th ?
let' s go away somewhere .
i haven' t got next season' s fixture list yet .
you know you' re seeing arsenal next year .
you can' t say whether you' il be seeing me .
so what ?
everyone' s like that .
you know you' il be seeing your sister next season .
sisters don' t have seasons .
whatever .
look , i know where this is going and you' re dead wrong .
i' m capable of commitment and all that stuff .
lf it doesn' t happen with you , that' s because of you , not me .
21 years i' ve been going to arsenal .
21 years .
paul , i don' t know whether you' ve noticed but arsenal are a football team .
and you think there' s a difference ?
yes , i do .
that shows what you know about it .
' shortly before kick off . '
that looked like rocky .
jo , go back to the news a minute .
it' s only the local news .
i know .
it looked like rocky .
who looked like rocky ?
who the hell is rocky ?
doesn' t matter .
we' ve missed it now .
that " rocky " is an arsenal player .
yeah , david rocastle .
and how do you know what he looks like ?
well , i don' t know .
it sinks in after a while .
what else has sunk in ?
d' you know where they are in the championship cup and who their best goal hanger is ?
i' m not turning into a moron .
ok , i know they' re top of the league .
that' s easy to remember .
and i know that alan " smudger " smith has scored most of the goals .
but it doesn' t ...
i' m going next week .
you' re going ?
yeah .
to a football match ?
yeah .
i thought i should .
ooh .
i tell you , girl , you' d better watch yourself .
soon after tim and i split up ,
i woke up one morning and realised i could remember his batting average for the previous season .
harmless enough , isn' t it ?
no !
it' s all a sinister form of male manipulation .
rubbish !
it' s true !
you get colonised .
your native culture gets driven out and it' s replaced by stuff you don' t even wanna know about .
they' re like bloody missionaries .
they bore you stupid until you cave in then they fuck off !
shut up !
did you get it ?
yes .
can i see it ?
it' s in me purse .
brilliant .
thanks , mum .
i' ve got to do an extra hour tomorrow .
left the office at twelve ,
i didn' t get back till three .
they asked you what end you wanted ?
no .
i said , " one , please " and they gave me that .
how comes you got a ticket in the reading end ?
had to get it off a tout .
how much did that cost you ?
fiver .
d' you live in lslington ?
well , near , yeah .
how near is near ?
place called maidenhead .
maidenhead ?
maidenhead in berkshire ?
two miles down the road ?
more like six .
bit nearer reading than arsenal .
you should be supporting your local team .
look ...
excuse me .
just seen someone i know .
and was the ticket all right , in the end ?
i was standing with a load of country bumpkins at first .
then i found jenkins and them .
so you stood with jenkins ?
what would you know ?
you must' ve been sick when they equalised .
i heard it on the radio .
the place went mad .
just had to stand and take it .
good old pat rice , though .
he never scores , pat rice .
first of the season .
we' re good in the cups , aren' t we ?
mcnab won' t play .
bertie mee wouldn' t risk him .
how long will it take to get to birmingham ?
couple of hours .
maybe three .
but we' il be there by two ?
oh , sure .
how about if we did something different this afternoon ?
how d' you mean ?
i thought you might like to meet jane and the kids for lunch .
then maybe take ' em to the zoo or pictures ... somewhere .
they' ve been over this week visiting their grandmother .
they' d love to meet you .
you don' t mean instead of the game , do you ?
we couldn' t do both .
you didn' t get any tickets , did you ?
the tickets are waiting for us there .
so you' re telling me you' ve got tickets but you wanna go and see " the jungle book " ?
you' re teasing me , aren' t you ?
we don' t have to go to arsenal every time i' m in london , do we ?
i thought we were beyond that stage .
we' il never be beyond that stage .
# out here in the fields
# i fight for my meals
# i get my back into my living
# i don' t need to fight
# to prove i' m right
# i don' t need to be forgiven
i thought you said you' d look after me .
you said you didn' t need looking after .
you' re gonna get your fucking heads kicked in !
gonna get your fucking heads kicked in !
fucking jump for the ball , niall !
come on , arsenal !
do you want this or not ?
' everton nil , norwich nil . '
you' il get used to it .
i don' t wanna get used to it .
what' s going on at the liverpool/ forest game ?
there' s trouble or something .
they ain' t kicked off yet .
there .
heard about hillsborough ?
this guy was just saying .
bloke up there reckons there' s people hurt .
jesus .
what happened ?
i dunno .
you all right ?
yeah , i' m fine .
arsenal !
arsenal !
arsenal !
arsenal !
' semi final
' between nottingham forest and liverpool
' at the hillsborough ground in sheffield .
' it' s feared that at least
' were crushed to death .
' hundreds were forced on to the pitch . '
it' s just so stupid .
' the liverpool manager , kenny dalglish ,
' and his opposite number , brian clough ,
' were clearly appalled by the scenes .
' there' s so far nothing to suggest ... '
so stupid . ' .. that what happened
' was the result of violence amongst fans . '
they must' ve realised something like this was gonna happen one day .
one afternoon on the north bank and you' re an expert .
well , that' s it , then .
that' s what ?
you can' t go back now , can you ?
' course we will .
how can you ?
because ... because everyone else will .
because the game will go on .
they' il even replay this one .
this doesn' t change anything .
i just don' t get you .
no , i know you don' t .
it' s not just me you don' t get .
it' s any of us .
i hope the rest of them aren' t as selfish and manipulative as you .
what' s selfish about watching a football team ?
it' s all selfish , all of it !
all those stupid stories about how your mum' s cats are called after great players and how she drove through the snow to get you a cup ticket .
you stopped seeing your father when you didn' t need him to take you to the games any more .
and we' re supposed to understand because football' s football .
when we think of paul , we think of arsenal .
it makes me sick !
i hated this afternoon .
d' you wanna know why ?
because if you didn' t give a toss about arsenal , what are you left with ?
you pay 5 to stand on a lump of concrete .
you can' t see anything , you' re not even safe .
and you can' t complain because that would be letting the lads down .
that' d show you didn' t care enough .
well , at least we care about something .
at least we' re not in night after night worrying about our lesson plans .
whether a scale 3 might come up in bournemouth .
perhaps one day you' il learn to care about something you can' t tick .
thanks .
i' m sorry .
football has meant too much to me and come to represent too many things .
after a while , it all gets mixed up together in your head .
you can' t remember whether
life' s shit because arsenal' s shit or the other way round .
i' ve been to watch far too many games , spent far too much money .
fretted about arsenal when i should have been fretting about something else .
i' ve asked too much of the people i love .
ok , i accept all that .
perhaps it' s something you can' t understand unless you belong .
but what about this ... ?
three minutes to go and you' re two one up in a semi final .
you look around and see thousands of faces contorted with fear and hope and worry .
everyone lost .
everything else gone out of their heads .
then the whistle blows and everyone goes spare .
and just for those few minutes , you' re at the centre of the whole world .
and the fact that you care so much , that the noise you' ve made has been such a crucial part of it , is what makes it special .
you' ve been as important as the players and if you hadn' t been there , who' d have been bothered about football , really ?
the great thing is , it comes round again and again .
there' s always another season .
lf you lose the cup final in may , there' s the third round to look forward to in january .
what' s wrong with that ?
it' s actually pretty comforting if you think about it .
but every now and then not very often , but it happens you catch a glimpse of a world that doesn' t work like that .
a world that doesn' t stop in may and begin again in august .
there' s some stuff that just never comes back .
and some stuff that just won' t go away .
and some stuff that you couldn' t ignore even if you wanted to .
hello .
' it' s me . '
do you know what time it is ?
' yeah , and i' m sorry . '
listen , are you pregnant ?
are these for me ?
yeah .
flowers .
i suppose they were , once upon a time .
thank you .
come on , jo .
oh .
and chocolates !
it' s come just at the right time for me .
it' s come just at the right time for me .
i was gettin ' bored with that pub and football stuff .
you can only spend so much time playing subbuteo .
having a kid' s a brilliant idea .
it wasn' t really an idea .
it might as well have been .
it' s perfect .
it' s not just the baby .
it' s , you know , it' s you as well .
i think we' re good together .
i thought i was miss jean brodie .
i was wrong .
i' ve been thinking about this .
you' re george graham .
the arsenal manager .
and that' s good , is it ?
it' s brilliant .
you' re careful and organised and methodical and all that .
that' s why we work .
i need somebody like that .
and you need somebody like me ....
work well as a team .
not even as a team , as a club .
paul , you do talk some terrible nonsense .
it' s not .
it' s the truth .
it' s all working out .
wife and baby , that' il do me .
who said anything about a wife ?
we' d want to do it properly , wouldn' t we ?
liam ? lf it' s a boy .
the greatest arsenal player ever but it' s a nice name .
better apply for the job .
what job ?
rosie' s head of year job .
i said no but now , brilliant .
perfect timing .
we' il need a bit more money
' cause we' il need a house .
paul ...
ted' il be pleased , anyway .
liam , brilliant .
paul ...
we could live near the ground .
it' s cheap ' cause no one wants a football stadium on their doorstep .
i' d pay extra but we won' t tell the estate agent .
mortgage , wife , kid cool .
paul , none of this is real .
you' re behaving like a little kid .
i' ve been impregnated by a 1 2 year old !
oh , thanks .
thanks very much .
sorry about that .
no problem , sir .
sorry , you were saying ?
paul , this is exactly what i mean .
that was just a one off .
never happened before .
i promise it won' t be a regular feature of life .
paul ...
i haven' t made up my mind what i' m doing about this yet .
do you understand ?
yes .
no , not really .
i can' t see this working out .
it' s my last chance .
don' t be silly .
it' s just what it feels like .
are you prepared to be a one parent family ?
i think if we go through with this , one of us is gonna have to be .
no , it' il be brilliant .
i don' t think i' ve been since george eastham was in the team .
before my time .
he was a lovely player .
the sort you don' t get any more .
languid and thoughtful and elegant .
you should come and watch tony adams .
how can i help , anyway ?
i changed my mind about that head of year job , if it' s not too late .
no .
no , excellent .
i' m very pleased .
i' ve had a couple of applications but i' d be glad to add your name .
thank you .
any particular reason for the change of mind ?
there is , actually , yes .
er , miss , um ...
well , miss hughes is pregnant .
sarah hughes ?
history ?
yes , yes , of course .
um ...
well , i didn' t , um ...
i mean , she ...
how does this affect you ?
sorry , no .
i left a bit out .
i' m the father .
i should' ve told you that straight away , shouldn' t l ?
anyway , yes , we' re having a baby .
i haven' t heard this from her .
you' re hearing it from me , now .
sorry , paul , i can' t share your joy .
sarah' s been with us five minutes and a member of staff has knocked her up !
i' m intending to marry her and everything .
we won' t embarrass the school .
you already have embarrassed the school !
how on earth are we supposed to talk to kids about responsibility and contraception and ... and the rest of it when the staff themselves ...
words fail me !
i thought you' d be pleased .
about what ?
the clandestine affair ?
the accidental pregnancy ?
not those bits , maybe , but me applying for the job .
that' s good , isn' t it ?
are you a complete fool , paul ?
i' il talk to you later .
yeah , ok , ok .
calm down .
i want you to take your foot off the gas in the second half .
what' s the fun of beating a team 1 5 or 20 nil ?
it' s brilliant fun !
all right .
just take it easy , eh ?
you' re like vultures .
now go on !
come on , lads !
oh , hi .
we' re winning 8 nil .
er , 9 nil .
calm down !
are you a complete fool ?
you' ve been to see ted .
he' s not best pleased with us .
who else are you gonna tell ?
the kids ?
we could recreate what we did in assembly .
find the durex that split and bring it in .
i could lose my job !
they can' t sack you for getting pregnant .
i haven' t been here long enough for maternity leave .
the union' il help .
none of this is the point , paul .
the point is ...
how many times have i told you about playing to the whistle ?
call me later , ok ?
see , if we ...
fuck !
fuck !
fuck !
come on , you useless shower !
this lot are crap get stuck in !
i' m not a psychologist ... but i' d suggest that taking up smoking the week you find out you' re pregnant indicates a certain ambivalence towards the pregnancy on your part .
he' s given up .
paul ? !
mm hm .
mr first thing in the morning ?
yeah .
we' re both making it clear where we stand .
i start drinking and smoking and he' s given everything up .
this is horrible .
i don' t care how much damage it' s doing to me .
so if everything' s as bad as you make out , how come you' re not applying for jobs in ... pitlochry ?
i know paul' s gone completely mad .
i know , i know , i know .
it' s just that it kind of rubs off on you somehow .
it makes a difference
to how you think about things .
like ?
like today , right ?
i want us to win .
with you so far .
i think we will .
home to norwich , you' d usually predict two nil defeat .
nil nil if you was on top of the world .
lf we don' t , it' s not the end of the world .
four games left . twelve points to be won .
that' s not what i mean .
lf we don' t win the league ,
i' il cope because of sarah and the baby .
when you' ve got nothing else going on ,
arsenal fill all the gaps .
you end up getting in a state about losing to spurs when really you should be getting in a state about yourself .
but we will win today .
sun' s out , i' m gonna be a father ,
alan smith' s back .
five nil , no trouble .
let' s go .
' george graham off the bench
' to shake hands with a very disappointed dave stringer .
' norwich know their championship challenge
' has evaporated .
' arsenal' s is very much
' on course after today .
' arsenal five , norwich city nil .
' alan smith the man of the match
' with two goals ,
' one of them a splendid effort ... '
everything' s happening at once and it' s brilliant .
stick with me .
no way we won' t win the league .
it' s all you , is it ?
nothing to do with george , smithy , rocky or me buying sugar mice ?
you never get feelings like that ?
i felt brilliant the day we got knocked out of the league by walsall .
got a pay rise , got off with caroline walsh the night before .
fat lot of fucking notice this lot took .
some of us have it , some of us haven' t .
you must' ve had a shitty life for 1 8 years .
i haven' t had it all the time but i' ve got it this season in spades .
did you go ?
yeah .
we were great , weren' t we ?
my mum wants a season ticket .
can i have a quick word ?
we' re just talking about the rout of norwich .
yes , saw it on tv .
very impressive .
it' s good that alan smith' s back .
yeah .
run along , robert .
i had a word with the governors .
they' il be happy to interview you for head of year .
thanks , ted .
ted ... l' m not planning to make a habit of this if that' s what you' re worried about .
it' s something out of the ordinary for me .
just be prepared , ok ?
school governors can be a funny lot .
' .. still middlesborough nil ,
' arsenal nil ... '
you' re kidding .
no way .
can' t afford anywhere else .
n5' s not the only place in the world , you know .
sarah , you know that' s not true .
you hardly hear anything , most games .
how often do they play ?
once a month .
something like that .
right .
do they leave much mess ?
no .
shall i leave you to look around ?
thanks , yeah .
what does it matter how close to the ground you live as long as you can come to the games ?
when i was a kid , i read this ... story about what used to happen round here on cup final days if arsenal were playing .
they' d have this procession .
the women and kids dressed up in fancy dress and led the men going to wembley to the station .
i lived in maidenhead .
what did we have there ?
money , decent schools , holidays abroad , enough food .
yeah .
you' re right , yeah .
i was lucky .
but i was rootless , too .
i didn' t have anything like that .
nothing i could be proud of , nothing i can look back on and feel sentimental about except telly programmes and pop music .
but it' s different here .
anyway ... it' s close to the tube .
it' s 50 minutes from the west end .
it' s not far from school .
i' m not prepared to indulge your fantasies .
the best thing for you would be to get further away , not a few yards nearer .
it doesn' t feel like that .
tough .
no .
no !
it' s a lovely house .
really .
it' s just the view .
' so george graham ... '
tell me again what was wrong with that place in ...
creighton avenue .
the one with the garden .
' despite all their control , arsenal ... '
i' m talking to myself .
somewhere a bit further north , anyway .
bounds green ?
' john lukic prepares to play it downfield ... '
watford ? ' .. lnto the middlesborough half ... '
how about darlington ?
there' s a team there .
' goal ! '
yes !
yes !
yes !
yes !
helsinki .
helsinki united are really good this season .
one martin hayes !
there' s only one martin hayes !
one martin ...
so , paul ...
confident ?
sorry , not about the job .
about what' s going on down the road .
arsenal .
my boy tells me you' re a fan .
oh , right .
well , er ... so far , so good .
season ticket holder ?
yes .
whereabouts ?
er , north bank .
right , shall we , um ... ?
who d' you think we should sign ?
think we need a new striker ?
er ...
i' m delighted we didn' t get kerry dixon .
ray ...
ray , i think we should , um ...
oh , sorry , ted .
once you get going , it' s hard to stop .
we know all about your teaching abilities .
what extra mural activites are you involved in ?
paul' s just coached the under 1 4s to the cup final .
my nigel thinks you should be england manager .
might be a more suitable position than head of year .
i did the school play last summer and ...
who' ve we got in the final ?
parkside ?
are they any good ?
pretty good .
and i' ve been very much involved in the pastoral side of things as a form teacher .
and we understand that , um , you' re an expectant father .
um ... yes .
that' s one of the extra mural activities you forgot to mention , paul .
chatting up other members of staff .
more than chatting them up .
you' ve got good taste , i' il give you that .
' as we reach the final saturday
' of the league season ,
' we' re not sure of the destiny of the league title .
' arsenal are favourites ... '
' both sides must keep winning .
' defeat for liverpool at wimbledon this afternoon
' and a win for arsenal against derby ... '
hello ?
oh , hello , ted . ' .. when they meet wimbledon . '
no , just watching saint and greavesie .
yeah , home to derby . ' .. at anfield ... '
thank you . ' .. on may the 26th . '
oh . .. oh , right .
i wasn' t really expecting it , to be honest .
it didn' t go brilliantly , did it ?
oh , is she ?
well , no ...
i think she' d make a very good head of year .
yeah .
look , thanks ...
thanks for letting me know .
no , i' d have swapped it for three points this afternoon anyway .
cheers , ted .
when was the last time you felt this nervous about a league game ?
i dunno .
1 971 , i should think .
two home wins , could be champions tuesday night .
lmagine .
what we gonna do ?
drink , i expect .
can' t think about it in bed at night otherwise i can' t sleep .
champions !
take back everything you said about me .
i will .
tuesday night .
this is the worst day of my life .
1 8 fucking years and they blow it on the last weekend of the season .
come on , paul , it' s only half time .
it' s only one nil .
doesn' t matter .
they' ve blown it .
knew they would , didn' t l ?
useless bastards !
i am sorry .
yeah , thanks .
how are you feeling ?
sick .
i just wasn' t expecting it , not today , anyway .
they had to tell you some time .
tell me what ?
what have we been talking about ?
what have you been talking about ?
the job !
the job ? !
you think i' d be this upset about a stupid , poxy job interview ?
we lost at home to derby today .
we' ve blown it !
when are you gonna wake up to yourself ?
wake up to myself ?
i am bloody awake !
i wish i wasn' t .
i want to go to sleep for the next ten seasons .
seasons .
i am sick to death of hearing about bloody seasons !
we live our lives in years , paul .
january through to december .
not all of us .
yes , all of us .
even you .
do you understand what today meant ?
you know how long i' ve been waiting for this ?
yes , i do .
1 8 years .
yeah , 1 8 years !
i' ve wanted arsenal to win the league
longer than i' ve wanted anything .
i' ve been after that head of year job for about two weeks .
you think i' d care about that more ?
no , you care more about one team scoring more than another .
you thought i came to comfort you about that ?
for a moment , yeah .
i credited you with imagination .
thought you might understand .
it' s only a game .
don' t say that !
please !
that is the worst , most stupid thing anyone could say !
it quite clearly isn' t only a game .
lf it was , d' you honestly think i' d care this much ?
eh ?
1 8 years !
1 8 ... years !
d' you know what you wanted 1 8 years ago ?
or ten ?
or five ?
did you wanna be head of year at a north london comprehensive ?
i doubt if you' ve wanted anything for that long .
and if you had , and if you' d spent three months thinking that finally you were gonna get it and just when you think it' s there , it' s taken away from you !
i don' t care what it is a car , a job , an oscar .
the baby .
then you' d understand how i was feeling tonight .
but there isn' t and you don' t , so ...
so what ?
so ... fuck off ?
go home ?
leave you alone ?
whatever .
there isn' t anything i' ve wanted for 1 8 years because i was a kid
lf i did still want the same things , i' d have gone wrong .
i don' t want to marry david cassidy , have bigger tits , do well in my mock ' o' s .
i' ve stopped worrying about all that .
maybe there' s a big bit of you that' s gone missing .
maybe everyone should want something they' ve always wanted .
i don' t know what i' ve been thinking of .
how d' you mean ?
we' ve both been pretending that this is possible and it' s not , is it ?
this wife and kids and la di da life' s great stuff .
it' s not on , any of it , is it ?
all it took was one bad football result and we' re now back to " life is shit so what' s the point ?
what ls the point ?
i don' t think that arsenal' s home form is a sturdy enough basis for marriage and parenthood .
no .
not even thls season .
' .. give him a surprise enema . '
' sir nigel ? '
hello ?
' how are you ? '
oh , hi , mum .
yeah , just having a night in .
yeah , i know .
they were awful .
yeah , yeah ...
she' s fine .
she ... says hello .
look , mum , i' ve gotta go .
supper' s on the table .
i' il call you tomorrow .
bye , mum .
mr ashworth , the play was supposed to start five minutes ago .
we' re waiting .
no good , miss .
he' s got the hump .
have you had a row ?
shut up , holly .
ok , everyone into the hall .
quietly !
how did arsenal get on last night ?
you have a look .
ooh ... sorry .
they drew two two .
what does that mean ?
dunno .
apart from bad .
it means they have to beat liverpool away to win the championship .
now , i' ve heard of liverpool .
they' re famous for being good , aren' t they ?
gary lineker , peter shilton , all that lot .
so arsenal have no chance ?
none whatsoever , it says here .
but do we really care that much ?
don' t bounce it in here .
miss hughes .
are you chewing ?
no .
and finally , i probably don' t need to tell you that the final of the south hertfordshire
schools cup competition takes place here this afternoon at 4 . 30 .
i' m sure you join me in wishing mr ashworth and the boys the very best of luck .
not that they' il need it .
i know that many of you will be anxious to get home to start your homework .
but ... those who feel they can spare the time , and wish to lend their vocal encouragement , will be most welcome .
thank you .
i think you stand an extremely good chance ...
how are we doing ?
losing one nil .
playing shit .
how long to go ?
almost finished .
penalty !
come on , somebody !
it' s all down to you , rob .
good boy , robert .
rob !
you' re useless !
sorry , sir .
you don' t need to say anything .
i wasn' t gonna say anything .
i should never have taken it .
no one else had the guts .
yeah , so i' m stupid as well as useless .
doesn' t matter .
you' ve had a brilliant season .
it' s not what i' m gonna remember , though , is it ?
anyway ...
winning this afternoon and arsenal winning tomorrow night ...
what would you go for ?
tomorrow night , of course .
there you go , then .
what ?
you' re telling me
arsenal are gonna win two nil at anfield .
can' t promise , can l ?
there' s a chance .
you' ve done your bit .
missed a penalty .
lf that' s what it takes , it' s worth it .
yeah , ' course .
# what can i say ?
# she' s walking away
# from what we' ve seen
# what can i do ?
# still loving you
# it' s all a dream
# how can we hang on to dreams ?
# how can it really be
# the way it seems ?
# what can i do ?
# she' s saying we' re through
# with how it was
# what will i try ?
# i still don' t see why
# she says what she does
# how can we hang on to dreams ?
# how can it really be
# the way it seems ? #
good luck , sir .
you' ve got nothing to worry about .
no chance .
hope you get stuffed , sir .
hi .
oh , hi .
off to watch the big match ?
yeah .
i just came to wish you good luck .
thanks .
the boys in my gcse set were trying to explain it to me .
you have to win two nil , right ?
yeah .
it' s possible , isn' t it ?
you' ve got no chance , sir .
shut up !
ls it right you' ve handed in your notice ?
yeah .
i need more money .
child support .
we could' ve managed .
between us .
it' d be a bit awkward , working in the next room to the absent father of your child .
maybe .
well , i' il be thinking of you tonight .
are you gonna watch ?
i' m not sure .
my fifth formers are having and end of school party and i' ve been invited .
but i' il try .
it doesn' t matter .
it' s only a stupid game .
' the teams occupying
' first and second place in the championship .
' the last match of the season
' for the league championship .
' the anfield roar welcoming and intimidating
' as we join our commentary team
' of david pleat and brian moore .
' thank you , elton .
' good evening , everybody .
' arsenal on the pitch ...
' with bouquets of flowers .
' which i think are ... '
we should be there .
you were the one who said it wasn' t worth the hassle .
i didn' t know it' d be the title decider .
anyway , imagine all those
scousers celebrating .
i' d rather be down here with my own people . .. person .
thank you .
oh , sorry .
# she' s gone away ,
# i don' t know where
# somewhere i can' t follow her ... #
thought you were a football fan , duncan .
that' s why i can' t stand arsenal .
sounds like an old joke .
no joke .
william ?
hate football .
and arsenal .
don' t you wanna know how they' re getting on ?
no .
go on , i bet you do .
we wouldn' t mind .
mind if miss hughes sticks the tv on ?
she wants the football scores .
i don' t , really .
not much .
i wonder why . lf you must , but just to find out the score .
ok .
still nil nil , first half .
' lnto that crowd it goes . '
there he is my mate , mickey thomas .
shut up , mum .
he' s useless .
i like him .
shows what you know .
' they out played them
' for most of the littlewoods cup tie ... '
miracle of modern technology .
but it hasn' t got an aerial or nothing .
it doesn' t need one .
' positive charge by adams
' but it falls to whelan . '
oh , hello , love .
i was wondering who' d dare ring tonight .
' arsenal have some very big chaps ... '
your brother' il have the phone off the hook .
' it' d be dangerous to give away ... '
no score .
no , not really .
they don' t look like they' re gonna let one in either .
hold on . ' .. tangling with whelan .
' michael thomas getting to the byline .
' danger for liverpool . '
oh !
no !
ah !
that was it .
that was our chance .
no , there' il be others .
you reckon ?
i don' t .
' arsenal within a whisker
' of getting the goal they wanted
' early in this game . '
let' s go out . .. you' re kidding .
no , let' s go and get hammered .
forget all about it .
i' m watching till the end .
can' t do that .
sorry .
' just imagine the tension
' if arsenal do manage to snatch a goal . '
sit down .
there' s no point !
i' m off in a minute .
i' il just ... stay till half time .
' everyone' s looking very closely at him .
' he' s beginning to get the mood of this game ... '
i' il just see what they' ve got to say .
doin ' ok , aren' t we ?
what' s the use of ok ?
might as well be losing eight nil .
lf you want to win a game two nil , you' ve got more chance if it' s nil nil at half time than if you' re eight goals down .
you' re living in cloud cuckoo land !
join the real world !
ln the real world , it' s nil nil at half time !
might as well be eight nil .
jesus , paul , you need medical help .
you' ve got some kind of disease that turns people into miserable bastards .
are you stayin ' ?
no !
' i' m just wondering at what stage
' george graham will decide ... '
just watch a couple of minutes of the second half .
' winterburn and richardson behind it .
' adams made a darting little run in there .
' and smith ! '
y e e es !
yes !
ha , ha !
yeah !
yes !
yes !
yes !
' liverpool players
' are surrounding the referee . '
he' s gonna disallow it now .
typical .
bet you any money you like .
' he' s coming to have a word with the linesman .
' now a crucial decision here .
' ronnie whelan looking on there .
' the goal' s been given . '
ye e es !
lsn' t that just like arsenal ?
they need two so they score one just to get us all going .
you want ' em to score a second before they scored the first ?
' and what a game we have now .
' the breakthrough by arsenal ,
' their fans ...
' are delighted .
' back to smith .
' adams there with him .
' merson ...
' richardson ...
' a chance here ...
' thomas ! '
oh ! ' .. grobbelar grabbed it . '
told you .
he' s useless .
' suddenly , thomas , totally unmarked ... '
that' s it .
i' ve had enough .
i' m off .
good .
fucking good riddance !
are you coming ?
no !
it' s m y flat !
you try gettin ' me out of it .
' and hansen will get it back .
' quarter of an hour left . '
they' ve scored !
ok , listen up , everyone .
i don' t know what to say now .
sasha !
um , well , basically , miss hughes , we had a whip round and bought you a thank you present .
was that it ?
brief and to the point .
thank you .
wait .
there' s a bit more .
well , we didn' t like you at first
' cause you gave us too much work .

dinner' s ready , guys !

# and i , l , i ... #
highbury , please .
whereabouts ?
just around the corner from the arsenal ground .
i don' t wanna go there tonight .
not now .
it' s in liverpool , the football .
but i' m tapin ' it , see .
they' il give the game away there .
they' il be doin ' their nut or be as quiet as the grave .
you can go in and out before the final whistle .
come on , then .
# lookin ' for my baby
# been around the world
# and i' m gonna ... ##
you' re an arsenal fan , then ?
used to be , when i was a kid .
charlie george an ' all of them .
i don' t go any more .
i' d bloody love ' em to win tonight .
i' d bloody love it !
' remember , arsenal need two goals .
' at the moment , they have one .
' lf it stays this way ,
' liverpool will be champions for the 1 9th time . '
we shouldn' t even have turned the tv on this evening .
' but will it stay this way ? '
what did we think would happen ?
i don' t reckon i' il be able to carry on after this .
i won' t be able to ... pick myself up .
well , to get this close !
' unless there is an amazing and dramatic ... '
why did i listen to you ?
me ?
you said we had a chance !
well , we did .
we do !
we' re practically in injury time !
' arsenal have powered forward
' in search of the second goal . '
i might start supporting a team that never wins .
orient or someone .
at least you know where you stand .
you don' t lay yourself open to situations like this .
' .. his team mate , john aldridge ... '
can you believe that ?
you' re on your way out .
see what they want when you' re down there .
' presumably , we' il have to go on .
' and remember ,
' arsenal have both substitutes already on . '
' one minute to go .
' mcmahon has got the word from the kop , obviously .
' but nobody knows quite how much time
' the referee will add on . '
this is awful !
it' s like the end of the world !
' lf arsenal are to lose the championship ,
' having had such a lead at one time ,
' it' s somewhat poetic justice
' that they have the result
' even though they' re not to win it . '
oh , shut up , pleat .
' you can see we' re now
' well into time added on . '
will you please , please , please , please please just fucking fuck off !
you have arrived during the worst 60 seconds of my life and i don' t want to see you !
i ask you !
what sort of berk would do that ?
you' d just about forgive an alien from planet tharg but even then , you' d ...
where you going ?
you' re mad !
you might miss something !
' adams is after his man .
' but barnes will not be denied .
' yes , he will , by richardson .
' down and injured .
' streaming forward now
' in what will be their last attack .
' good ball by dixon , finding smith .
' to thomas .
pa a a a a aul !
' charging through the midfield , thomas ! '
' it' s up for grabs now ...
' thomas !
' right at the end . '
a a a a a a ah !
' an unbelievable climax
' to the league season ! '
a a a a a a ah !
mickey thomas !
yeah !
yes !
yes !
yes !
oh !
oh ...
how much injury time is there ?
they' ve had two minutes already .
they' il go straight up the other end and score .
' that' s the final whistle .
' arsenal , the champions . '
and ashworth has done it !
arsenal !
arsenal !
we are the champions !
yeah !
# from the dark end of the street
# to the bright side of the road
# we' il be lovers once again
# on the bright side of the road
yes !
# little darling , come with me
# you can help me share my load
# from the dark end of the street
# to the bright side of the road ... #
i knew we' d do it .
i had this feeling .
oh , yeah ?
you' re a lying bastard .
no , no , honestly .
on the surface ,
i was all negativity and doubt .
but on the inside , you gotta believe , haven' t you ?
# baby , some time
# i feel some time , i don' t know why ...
# let' s enjoy it while we can
# let' s enjoy it while we can
# help me sing my song
# help me sing my song
# little darling , follow me
# to the bright side of the road
# from the dark end of the street
# from the dark end of the street
# to the bright side of the road
# to the bright side of the road ... #
i am sorry .
no .
no , thank you .
i wouldn' t have missed this for the world !
paul !
friend of yours ?
a guy i work with .
he' s enjoying himself .
yeah .
i' ve never seen him so happy .
when i think back to the 26th of may , 1 989 now , it' s impossible to explain exactly what happened to either of us .
all three of us if you count the team .
but i do know this my relationship with arsenal changed that night .
it was as if i' d jumped on to the shoulders of the team and they' d carried me into the light that had suddenly shone down on all of us .
and the lift they gave me enabled be to part company with them in some ways .
we still see each other all the time and i still love them and hate them .
but i have my own life now .
my successes and failures aren' t necessarily linked up with theirs .
that' s got to be a good thing , i suppose .
life' s never gonna be this good again .
fuck off .
don' t start on me .
no , you don' t get ...
what' s his name ?
michael thomas .
you don' t get michael thomas moments in real life .
you don' t get many in football , either .
i' m not in such a state , am l ?
i didn' t need saving after all .
what ?
let' s not get carried away .
you' re still a tragic human being .
do we look particularly tragic tonight ?
didn' t see many miss jean brodies
leaping around the streets .
all too busy writing out tomorrow' s lesson plans .
where did you find the term " lesson plan " ?
you' ve never planned a lesson .
i' ve got better things to do .
oh , is that right ?
ls , er , is george graham really horrible ?
why ?
no reason .
has somebody else noticed the resemblance ?
yeah .
my fifth formers .
hah !
he has the reputation of being mean and dour and unapproachable and ...
ok , ok .
thank you , paul .
i think i get the message .
and driven !
# i think i' m going back
# to the things i learned so well
# ln my youth
# i think i' m returning to ...
# those days when i was young enough
# to know the truth
# now there are no games
# to only pass the time
# no more electric trains
# no more trees to climb
# but thinking young and growing older
# ls no sin
# and i can play
# the game of life to win
# i can recall a time ...
# when i wasn' t ashamed
# to reach out to a friend
# now i think i' ve got ...
# a lot more than just my toys to lend
# now there' s more to do
# than watch my sail boats glide
# and every day can be ...
# a magic carpet ride
# a little bit of courage
# ls all we lack
# so catch me if you can ...
# i' m going back #
