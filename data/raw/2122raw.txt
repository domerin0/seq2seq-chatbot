hello , mrs. macgruder .
hello , miss daniels .
have you ever seen so many gulls ?
what do you suppose it is ?
there must be a storm at sea .
that can drive them inland , you know .
i was hoping you' d be a little late .
he hasn' t arrived yet .
but you said 3 : 00 .
i know .
i know .
i' ve been calling all morning .
oh , miss daniels , you have no idea .
they are so difficult to get .
really , they are .
we have to get them from india when they' re baby chicks , and then
this one won' t be a chick , will he ?
oh , no , certainly not .
this will be a full grown mynah bird .
and he' il talk ?
well , yes , of course he' il
well , no , you' il have to teach him to talk .
i guess maybe i' d better phone .
they said 3 : 00 .
maybe it' s the traffic .
i' il call .
would you mind waiting ?
well , maybe you' d better deliver him .
let me give you my address .
oh , well , all right , but i' m sure they' re on the way .
would you mind if i called ?
no .
all right .
i wonder if you could help me .
what ?
i said , i wonder if you could help me .
yes .
what is it you' re looking for , sir ?
lovebirds .
lovebirds , sir ?
yes .
i understand there are different varieties .
is that true ?
well , yes , there are .
well , these are for my sister for her birthday , and as she' s only gonna be 1 1 , i wouldn' t want a pair of birds ... that were ... too demonstrative .
i understand completely .
at the same time , i wouldn' t want them to be too aloof .
no , of course not .
do you happen to have a pair of birds that are ... just friendly ?
oh , i think so .
now , then , let me see .
aren' t those lovebirds ?
no .
those are , uh ... red birds .
i thought they were strawberry finches .
yes .
we call them that too .
here we are .
lovebirds .
those are canaries .
doesn' t this make you feel awful ?
doesn' t what make me feel having all these poor , innocent creatures caged up like this ?
well , we can' t just let them fly around the shop .
i suppose not .
i is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages ?
certainly .
it' s to protect the species .
yes , that' s important , especially during the molting season .
that' s a particularly dangerous time .
are they molting now ?
oh , some of them are .
how can you tell ?
well , they ... get a sort of hangdog expression .
yes , i see .
well , what about the lovebirds ?
are you sure you wouldn' t like to see a canary instead ?
we have some very nice canaries this week .
all right .
all right .
may i see it , please ?
oh !
oh !
what is it ?
oh !
oh !
oh !
oh !
oh !
oh !
oh !
there we are .
oh , there .
wonderful .
back in your gilded cage , melanie daniels .
what did you say ?
i was merely drawing a parallel , miss daniels .
how did you know my name ?
a little birdie told me .
good day , miss daniels .
madam .
hey , wait a minute .
i don' t know you .
ah , but i know you .
how ?
we met in court .
we never met in court or anyplace else .
that' s true .
i' il rephrase it .
i saw you in court .
when ?
don' t you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a window ?
i didn' t break that window .
yes , but your little prank did .
the judge should' ve put you behind bars .
what are you , a policeman ?
i merely believe in the law .
and i' m not too keen on practical jokers .
what do you call your lovebird story  i really wanted the lovebirds .
you knew i didn' t work here .
you deliberately i recognized you when i came in .
i thought you might like to know what it' s like to be on the other end of a gag .
what do you think of that ?
i think you' re a louse .
i am .
good day , miss daniels .
madam .
and i' m glad you didn' t get your lovebirds .
i' il find something else .
see you in court .
who was that man ?
i have no idea .
they said the mynah bird would be here later this afternoon , if you care to come back .
no , you' d better send him .
may i use this phone ?
why , certainly .
daily news ?
it' s melanie daniels .
could you get me the city desk ?
just a minute , mrs. macgruder .
hello , charlie .
melanie .
i want you to do a favor for me .
no , this is a small one .
pressure you ?
why , charlie , darling , would i try to pressure you ?
would you call the department of motor vehicles for me ?
w j h 0 0 3 .
yes , a california plate .
no .
i' il stop off in a little while .
is daddy in his office ?
no , i don' t want to break in on a meeting .
tell him i' il see him later .
thank you , charlie .
do you have any lovebirds ?
well , no , not in the shop , but i can order them for you .
how soon ?
well well , when would you want them ?
immediately .
well , i could probably have them here by tomorrow morning .
would that be all right ?
that would be just fine .
miss , is that for mitch brenner ?
yes .
he' s not home .
that' s all right .
he won' t be back until monday i mean , if those birds are for him .
monday ?
yes .
i don' t think you should leave them in the hall , do you ?
well where did he go ?
bodega bay .
he goes there every weekend .
bodega bay .
where' s that ?
up the coast , about 60 miles north of here .
sixty mi oh !
it' s an hour and a half by freeway , or two hours if you take the coast highway .
i' d look after them myself , but i' m going away too .
i' m awfully sorry .
good morning .
good morning .
i wonder if you could help me .
i' il try my best .
i' m looking for a man named mitchell brenner .
yeah .
do you know him ?
yeah .
where does he live ?
right here , bodega bay .
yes , i know , but where ?
right across the bay there .
where ?
now , see where i' m pointing ?
yes .
see them two big trees across there ?
on the other side of the bay ?
yes .
and the white house ?
yes .
that' s where the brenners live .
the brenners ?
mr. and mrs. brenner ?
no . just jydia and the two kids .
the two kids ?
yeah , mitch and the little girl .
oh , i see .
how do i get down there ?
you follow the road around the bay , and that' il take you to their front door .
the front door .
is there a back road i can take ?
no .
that' s the only road .
you see , i want to surprise them .
oh .
i don' t want them to see me arrive .
oh .
it' s a surprise , you see .
well , you could get yourself a boat and cut right across the bay to their dock .
where would i get a boat ?
down by the tides restaurant .
did you ever handle an outboard boat ?
of course .
want me to order one for you ?
well , thank you .
what name ?
daniels .
okay .
i wonder if you could tell me yeah .
hold it a minute , please .
the little girl' s name ?
the little brenner girl ?
yes .
uh , alice , i think .
harry , what' s the brenner girl' s name ?
j ois . alice , isn' t it ? no , it' s j ois .
it' s alice .
are you sure ?
well , i' m not positive , if that' s what you mean .
i need her exact name .
oh , uh just hold on one more minute , please .
in that case , i' il tell you what you do .
go straight through town till you see a little hotel on your left .
then you turn right there .
now , you got that ?
yes .
near the top of the hill , you' il see the school , and just beyond , a little house with a red mailbox .
that' s where annie hayworth , the schoolteacher , lives .
you ask her about the little brenner girl .
well , thank you .
save yourself a lot of trouble .
name' s alice for sure .
can i have the boat in about 20 minutes ?
how much for the phone calls ?
oh , it' s nothing .
thank you .
who is it ?
me .
who' s " me " ?
miss hayworth ?
yes .
i' m melanie daniels .
i' m sorry to bother you , but yes ?
the man at the post office sent me .
he said you could tell me the name of the brenner girl .
cathy ?
the one who lives in the white house across the bay ?
that' s the one .
cathy brenner .
he seemed sure it was either alice or lois .
which is why the mail never gets delivered to the right place in this town .
i' m sorry .
smoke ?
thank you .
did , uh you want to see cathy about something ?
well , not exactly .
oh .
are you a friend of mitch' s ?
no , not really .
i' ve been wanting a cigarette for the last 20 minutes .
i just couldn' t convince myself to stop .
this tilling of the soil can become compulsive , you know .
it' s a very pretty garden .
oh , thank you .
well , it' s something to do in your spare time .
there' s a lot of spare time in bodega bay .
are , uh , you planning on staying long ?
no , just a few hours .
then you' re leaving after you see cathy .
well , something like that .
i' m sorry .
i don' t mean to sound so mysterious .
actually , it' s none of my business .
well , i better be on my way .
thank you very much .
not at all .
did you drive up from san francisco by the coast road ?
yes .
nice drive .
it' s very beautiful .
is that where you met mitch ?
yes .
yes .
i guess that' s where everyone meets mitch .
now you sound a bit mysterious , miss hayworth .
do i ?
i don' t mean to .
actually , i' m an open book , i' m afraid .
or , rather , a closed one .
oh , pretty .
what are they ?
lovebirds .
i see .
good luck , miss daniels .
thank you .
can i get out this way ?
go right around .
it' il take you back to the main road .
thank you .
do you have a boat for miss daniels ?
yes , ma' am .
it' s the one right below .
are you all right ?
yes , i think so .
what made it do that ?
that' s the damnedest thing i ever saw .
it seemed to swoop down at you deliberately .
oh , you' re bleeding too .
let' s take care of that .
okay ?
that' s a girl .
come on .
what happened , mitch ?
gull hit her .
a gull ?
oh .
let' s try up at the restaurant , all right ?
might need a tetanus shot .
i had a booster before i went abroad last may .
what happened ?
hello , deke .
young lady cut herself .
shall i call a doctor ?
i don' t think it' s that serious .
let' s see .
helen , get some cotton and antiseptic .
um , you cut yourself outside , miss ?
don' t worry , deke .
she did it in a boat .
i had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once .
sued me before i could bat an eyelash .
i don' t think miss daniels is gonna sue anybody .
here .
well , you' re the lawyer .
thank you .
what' s that ?
just some peroxide .
i' il clean out the cut .
so you' re a lawyer .
that' s right .
of course , i usually defend people , but if i were prosecuting
do you practice here ?
uh uh , san francisco .
what are you doing up here ?
what kind of law ?
criminal .
is that why you want to see everyone behind bars ?
oh , not everyone .
only violators and practical jokers .
that' s right .
ow !
oh , sorry .
what are you doing up here ?
didn' t you see the lovebirds ?
you mean , you came all this way to bring me those birds ?
to bring your sister those birds .
you said it was her birthday .
besides , i was coming up anyway .
what for ?
to see a friend of mine .
careful .
oh , sorry .
uh ... who' s your friend ?
annie hayworth , the schoolteacher .
annie hayworth .
well , small world .
yes .
how do you know annie ?
we went to school together college .
did you ?
imagine that .
how long are you staying up here ?
the weekend .
well , i think the bleeding' s almost stopped .
why don' t you hold that on
so you came up to see annie , huh ?
yes .
i think you came up to see me .
now , why would i want to see you of all people ?
i don' t know , but you must' ve gone to a lot of trouble ... to find out who i was and where i lived .
it was no trouble at all .
i simply called my father' s newspaper .
besides , i was coming up anyway .
i' ve already told you that .
you really like me , huh ?
i loathe you .
you have no manners .
you' re arrogant and conceited .
i wrote you a letter about it , in fact , but i tore it up .
what did it say ?
none of your business .
i can' t say i like your seagulls much , either .
i come all the way up here to you were coming up anyway , remember ?
mitch ?
i thought i saw your car .
what are you doing in town ?
i had to acknowledge a delivery .
a what ?
mother , i' d like you to meet melanie daniels .
miss daniels , my mother .
how do you do ?
how do you do , miss daniels ?
acknowledge a what ?
a delivery .
miss daniels brought us some birds from san francisco .
oh .
for cathy for her birthday .
where is she ?
across at brinkmeyer' s .
miss daniels is staying up here for the weekend .
so i' ve already invited her for dinner tonight .
well , you did go to the trouble of bringing those birds .
oh , i couldn' t possibly .
you did say birds ?
yes , lovebirds .
oh , i see .
so we couldn' t let you get away without thanking you in some small way .
and you haven' t met cathy , and you are staying the weekend .
well , yes , but you are , aren' t you ?
certainly , but then it' s all settled .
what time is dinner , mother ?
7 : 00 , the same as usual .
i' il pick you up .
where are you staying ?
with annie , of course .
oh , of course .
how stupid of me .
a quarter of 7 : 00 ?
annie may have made other plans .
i' il have to see .
besides , i can find my own way .
you' re sure now ?
you won' t hire a boat or anything ?
i' m sure .
7 . : 00 , then .
maybe .
we' il be waiting for you .
how' s your head ?
much better , thank you .
a gull hit me , mrs. brenner , that' s all .
oh , hi .
did you find her all right ?
yes , i did .
i was wondering
uh , that sign there .
do you suppose i could have the room for just a single night ?
i was planning on renting it for a longer time i would appreciate it .
i' ve tried everywhere in town .
they' re all full .
well , all right .
got your bags in the car ?
well , it' s utilitarian , i' il say that .
i just picked up some things for the night at the general store .
i hadn' t planned on staying very long .
yes , i know .
did something unexpected come up ?
yes .
may i use your phone ?
i' d like to call home .
i just put some coffee on the stove .
don' t they ever stop migrating ?
hi !
hi !
miss daniels ?
yes .
oh , they' re beautiful !
they' re just what i wanted .
is there a man and a woman ?
i can' t tell which is which .
well , i suppose so .
hello there .
annie had no plans , huh ?
no .
we' re very glad you could come .
are you hungry ?
reasonably .
dinner' s just about ready .
we' ve been looking at the chickens .
something seems to be wrong with them .
there' s nothing wrong with those chickens .
i' m going to call fred brinkmeyer right now .
what good' s that gonna do ?
the chickens won' t eat .
he sold the feed to me , didn' t he ?
caveat emptor , mother .
let the buyer beware .
whose side are you on ?
merely quoting the law , dear .
never mind the law .
this won' t take long , miss dan hello , fred ?
lydia brenner .
i didn' t interrupt your dinner , did i ?
how about a drink ?
i' d love one .
that feed you sold me is no good .
the chicken feed .
well , it' s just no good .
the chickens won' t eat it .
they' re always hungry .
i opened a sack for them when i got home , and they just wouldn' t touch it .
you know chickens as well as i do , and when they won' t eat , there' s something wrong with what they' re being fed .
no , they' re not fussy chickens .
who ?
what' s he got to do with it ?
is that your father ?
mm hmm .
please sit down .
i don' t care how many sacks of feed you sold him .
my chicken
oh , i see .
dan fawcett .
this afternoon ?
that proves what i' m saying .
the feed you sold us
oh .
well , maybe i better go over and see him .
you don' t think there' s something going around , do you ?
no , never !
no , they don' t seem sick at all .
they just won' t eat .
uh huh .
well , i' il try to go over and see him .
maybe he
uh huh .
all right .
thanks .
he had a call from dan fawcett a while ago .
his chickens won' t eat either .
it' s what you said , mom .
mr. brinkmeyer' s feed is no good .
no , cathy .
he sold mr. fawcett a different brand .
you don' t think they' re getting sick , do you , mitch ?
i still don' t understand how you knew i wanted lovebirds .
your brother told me .
then you knew mitch in san francisco ?
is that right ?
no , not exactly .
mitch knows a lot of people in san francisco .
of course , they' re mostly hoods .
cathy !
well , mom , he' s the first to admit it .
he' s spends half his day in the detention cells at the hall of justice .
in a democracy , cathy , everyone is entitled to a fair trial .
your brother' s practice aw , mom , please !
i know all that democracy jazz .
they' re still hoods .
he has a client now who shot his wife in the head six times .
six times !
can you imagine it ?
i mean , even twice would be overdoing it , don' t you think ?
why did he shoot her ?
he was watching a ball game on television .
what ?
his wife changed the channel .
are you coming to my party tomorrow ?
i don' t think so .
i have to get back to san francisco .
don' t you like us ?
oh , darling , of course i do .
don' t you like bodega bay ?
i don' t know yet .
mitch likes it very much .
he comes up every weekend , you know , even though he has his own apartment in the city .
he says san francisco' s like an anthill at the foot of a bridge .
i suppose it does get hectic at times .
well , if you do decide to come , don' t say i told you about it .
it' s supposed to be a surprise party .
they' ve got this whole complicated thing figured out ... where i' m going to michele' s for the afternoon , and michele' s mother will say that she has a headache , would i mind if she took me home .
then when i get home here , all the kids' il jump out !
oh , won' t you come ?
won' t you please come ?
i don' t think so .
she' s a charming girl , isn' t she , mitch ?
hmm ?
yes .
certainly pretty .
mm hmm .
how long have you known her ?
now , i told you , dear , we met yesterday .
in a bird shop .
in a bird shop .
she was selling birds ?
no , no .
i just led her into believing that i believed she was , and then
it' s all very complicated .
but she did buy the lovebirds and then drove all the way here .
mother .
yes ?
where did you go to law school ?
forgive me .
i suppose i' m just naturally curious about a girl like that .
she' s very rich , isn' t she ?
yeah , i suppose so .
her father' s part owner of one of the big newspapers .
you' d think he could manage to keep her name out of print .
she' s always mentioned in the columns , mitch .
yes , i know .
she is the one who jumped into a fountain in rome last summer , isn' t she ?
yes .
i supposed i' m old fashioned .
i know it was supposed to be very warm there , but
well , actually the newspapers said she was naked .
yes , i know , dear .
it' s none of my business , but when you bring a girl like that
darling ?
yes ?
i think i can handle melanie daniels by myself .
well ... as long as you know what you want , mitch .
i know exactly what i want .
be able to find your way back all right ?
oh , yes .
will i be seeing you again ?
san francisco' s a long way from here .
i' m in san francisco five days a week with a lot of time on my hands .
i' d like to see you .
maybe we could go swimming or something .
mother tells me you like to swim .
how does mother know what i like to do ?
we read the same gossip column .
oh , that rome .
i really like to swim .
we might get along very well .
in case you' re interested , i was pushed into that fountain .
without any clothes on ?
with all my clothes on .
the newspaper that ran that story ... happens to be a rival of my father' s paper .
you were just a poor , innocent victim of circumstances ?
i' m neither poor nor innocent .
the truth of that particular the truth is , you' re running around with a pretty wild crowd .
yes , that' s the truth , but i was pushed into that fountain , and that' s the truth too .
uh huh .
do you really know annie hayworth ?
no .
at least i didn' t until i came up here .
so you didn' t go to school together ?
no .
and you didn' t come here to see her ?
no !
you were lying !
yes , i was lying .
what about the letter you wrote me ?
is that a lie ?
no , i wrote the letter .
well , what did it say ?
it said , " dear mr. brenner .
i think you need these lovebirds after all .
they may help your personality .
that' s what it said .
but you tore it up ?
yes .
why ?
because it seemed stupid and foolish .
like jumping into a fountain in rome .
i told you what happened !
you don' t expect me to believe that , do you ?
i don' t give a damn what you believe !
i' d still like to see you .
why ?
i think it might be fun .
that might' ve been good enough in rome , but it' s not good enough now .
it is for me .
well , not for me .
what do you want ?
i thought you knew .
i want to go through life ... jumping into fountains naked .
good night .
miss daniels , is that you ?
yes .
hi .
is something wrong ?
is that cut beginning to bother you ?
no , it' s not the cut that' s bothering me .
would you like some brandy ?
if you have some , i' d love it .
i' il get it .
why don' t you sit down .
oh , would you like a sweater or something , a quilt ?
no .
no , thank you .
won' t you call me melanie ?
all right .
thank you .
gets a bit chilly here at night sometimes , especially if you' re over near the bay .
well , how did your evening go ?
did you meet jydia ?
or would you rather i changed the subject ?
i think so .
well , how do you like our little hamlet ?
i despise it .
i suppose it doesn' t offer much to the casual visitor , unless you' re thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside .
it takes a bit of getting used to .
where are you from originally ?
san francisco .
how did you happen to come up here ?
a friend invited me up for a weekend a long time ago .
look , i see no reason for being coy about this .
it was mitch brenner .
i guess you knew that anyway .
i suspected as much .
well , you needn' t worry .
it' s been over and done with a long time ago .
annie , there' s nothing between mr. brenner and me .
isn' t there ?
well , maybe there isn' t .
maybe there' s never been anything between mitch and any girl .
what do you mean ?
i think i' il have some of that .
i was seeing a lot of him in san francisco .
one weekend , he invited me up to meet lydia .
when was this ?
oh , four years ago , shortly after his father died .
of course , things may be different now .
different ?
with lydia .
did she seem a trifle distant ?
mm , a trifle .
well , then perhaps things aren' t quite so different .
you know , her attitude nearly drove me crazy .
when i got back to san francisco , i spent days trying to figure out ... what i' d done to displease her .
well , what had you done ?
nothing .
i simply existed .
so what' s the answer ?
ajealous woman , right ?
a clinging , possessive mother ?
wrong .
with all due respect to oedipus , i don' t think that was the case .
then what was it ?
lydia liked me .
that' s the strange part .
now that i' m no longer a threat , we' re very good friends .
then why did she object to you ?
because she was afraid .
afraid you' d take mitch ?
afraid i' d give mitch .
i don' t understand .
afraid of any woman who would give mitch the one thing lydia can give him : love .
that adds up to a jealous , possessive woman .
no , i don' t think so .
you see , she' s not afraid of losing mitch .
she' s only afraid of being abandoned .
someone ought to tell her she' d be gaining a daughter .
no .
she already has a daughter .
well , what about mitch ?
didn' t he have anything to say about this ?
well , i can understand his position .
he' d just been through a lot with lydia after his father died .
he didn' t want to risk going through it all again .
oh , i see .
so it ended .
not right then , of course .
we went back to san francisco , saw each other now and then , but we both knew it was over .
then what are you doing here in bodega bay ?
i wanted to be near mitch .
oh , it was over and done with , and i knew it , but ...
i still wanted to be near him .
i still like him a hell of a lot , and i don' t want to lose that friendship ... ever .
hello .
hello .
no , no , no , i wasn' t asleep .
yes , just a little while ago .
sure .
hold on .
it' s mitch .
for you .
hello ?
oh , yes , this is melanie .
fine , thank you .
no , no trouble at all .
i simply followed the road .
well there' s no need to apologize .
i can understand
that' s very kind of you .
no , i' m not angry .
well , i couldn' t .
i have to get back to san francisco .
no , i wouldn' t want to disappoint cathy , but
i see .
all right .
yes , i' il be there .
good night , mitch .
he wants me to go to cathy' s party tomorrow afternoon .
i said i would .
it should be fun .
i' il be there , too , to help .
oh , it seems so pointless .
well , i think i' il go to sleep .
it' s been a busy day .
my luggage .
that' s pretty .
where' d you get that ?
brinkmeyer' s ?
mm hmm .
do you think i should go ?
well , that' s up to you .
no , it' s really up to lydia , isn' t it ?
never mind lydia .
do you want to go ?
yes .
then go .
thank you , annie .
oh .
wonder who that can be .
is someone there ?
who is it ?
look .
poor thing .
probably lost his way in the dark .
but it isn' t dark , annie .
there' s a full moon .
cathy , that' s very good .
very good .
okay .
here we go .
attagirl .
come on .
don' t let him get you .
no , i really shouldn' t have any more .
i' m driving .
well , actually , i' m trying to get you to stay for dinner .
a lot of roast beef left over .

cheers .

what' s so important in san francisco ?

i have several jobs .
what do you do ?
i do different things on different days .
like what ?
well , on mondays and wednesdays , i work for the travelers ' aid at the airport .
helping travelers ?
no , misdirecting them .
i thought you could read my character .
on tuesdays , i take a course in general semantics at berkeley ... finding new four letter words .
that' s not a job , of course  you mean , you don' t have to
and on thursdays , i have my meeting and lunch .
in the underworld , i suppose .
i shall disappoint you .
we' re sending a little korean boy through school .
we actually raise money for it .
you see , rome
that entire summer , i did nothing but
well , it was very easy to get lost there .
so when i came back , i thought it was time i began
i don' t know finding something again .
so , on mondays and thursdays , i keep myself busy .
what about fridays ?
fridays ?
they' re free .
i sometimes go to bird shops on fridays .
i' m very glad you do .
a nice , innocent , little day .
oh , yes .
i have an aunt tessa .
have you got an aunt tessa ?
mm mm .
mine is very prim and straight laced .
i' m giving her a mynah bird when she comes back from europe .
mynah birds talk , you know .
can you see my aunt tessa' s face ... when this one tells us one or two of the words i' ve picked up at berkeley ?
you need a mother' s care , my child .
not my mother' s .
oh , i' m sorry .
what have you got to be sorry about ?
my mother ?
don' t waste your time .
she ditched us when i was 1 1 and ran off with some hotel man in the east .
you know what a mother' s love is ?
yes , i do .
you mean it' s better to be ditched ?
no .
i think it' s better to be loved .
don' t you ever see her ?
i don' t know where she is .
well , maybe i ought to go join the other children .
all right .
here we go .
one ... two ... three .
there you go .
j ook !
j ook !
hey !
no touching allowed !
oh !
help me get the children into the house .
there you go .
have they gone , mitch ?
i think so .
is anyone hurt ?
jenny got a scratch down her cheek , but it' s nothing .
that makes three times .
mitch , this isn' t usual , is it ?
the gull when i was in the boat yesterday , the one at annie' s last night
last night ?
what do you mean ?
a gull smashed into annie' s front door .
mitch , what' s happening ?
i i don' t know .
do you have to go back to annie' s ?
no .
i have my things in the car .
stay and have something to eat before you start back .
i' d feel a lot better .
would you like some mustard with that ?
no , thank you .
why didn' t annie stay ?
said something about going home to take a call from her sister .
what' s the matter with them ?
what' s the matter with all the birds ?
where did you want this coffee ?
here on the table , honey .
hurry up with yours , mitch .
i' m sure miss daniels wants to be on her way .
i think you ought to stay the night , melanie .
we have an extra room upstairs and everything .
that road can be a pretty bad one at night .
if i go across to santa rosa , i' il come out on the freeway much earlier , won' t i ?
yes , and the freeway is much quicker .
but she' il be hitting all the heavy traffic going back to san francisco .
just listen to those lovebirds .
mitch .
cover your faces !
cover your eyes !
that' s a sparrow , all right .
we know what it is , al .
did you have a light burnin ' or somethin ' ?
yes , but there wouldn' t have been that much light going up the chimney .
sometimes birds are attracted by light .
sure is a peculiar thing .
all right , but we' ve got to do something about it !
i don' t think i get you , mitch .
do about what ?
well , the birds invaded the house .
what' s more likely they got in the room and just panicked .
i' il admit a bird will panic in an enclosed room , but they didn' t just get in ; : they came in , right down the chimney .
my wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once .
tell him about the party .
we had a party here this afternoon for cathy , for her birthday .
how old is she ?
eleven !
in the middle of the party , some seagulls came down at the children !
miss daniels was attacked by a gull yesterday .
yeah .
were the kids bothering the birds or something ?
if you make any kind of a disturbance near them , they' il come after you .
al , the children were playing a game .
those gulls attacked .
now , jydia , " attack " is a pretty strong word , don' t you think ?
i mean , birds just don' t go around attacking people without no reason .
the kids probably scared ' em , that' s all .
these birds attacked .
you got quite a mess here , i' il admit that .
maybe you ought to put some screen on top of your chimney .
you want help cleaning up ?
no .
i can handle it .
it shouldn' t be too much of a job .
i' il take cathy up to bed .
i think i should stay , don' t you ?
it would be nice if you could .
my things are in the car .
do you want to go with me ?
all right .
well , anything else i can do , mitch ?
no thanks , al .
we' il be all right .
good night , jydia .
sure is peculiar .
