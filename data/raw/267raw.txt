now you got me .
saru .
i have a job for you .
if you accept my offer , then all of your past crimes will be for gotten .
if you get me out of here , that means many more people will die .
what have you been doing at a time like this ?
you killed someone ?
our swords are only for the mission !
you don' t understand !
the performers were attacked instead of us .
they had our drawing .
so yae and
we must leave here immediately .
kiyomasa is still alive .
we killed his double .
what did you say ?
amagi , what' s wrong ?
ninja' s poison got him .
say it isn' t so .
let' s go .
quick !
let' s go ?
master , what about amagi ?
amagi won' t last .
master , what are you talking about ?
you are going to leave him behind ?
we can' t do that !
why do you think we have worked so hard until now ?
damn it , i am totally confused !
have you for gotten that we live only to carry out our mission ?
we killed our dear friends , and stood by when villagers were murdered .
killing an enemy we don' t hate is one thing , but not saving innocent people from dying ...
what is our mission , then ?
after everything we' ve been through , how can we leave amagi here ?
master !!
who are you aiming your sword at ?
withdraw your sword , ukiha !
your sword can' t even kill an insect at this moment .
it' s like swinging a mere stick .
you are no longer an assassin .
amagi .
sorry .
go ... ... please go .
don' t be silly , amagi .
amagi !
amagi !
why did you do that ?
i' il walk you ... to the main road .
good bye .
good bye .
listen hyuga .
why don' t you come to tangou ?
what ?
it' s my hometown .
we' il have azumi come , too .
tangou ?
sorry , yae .
i may not be able to come to tangou .
i thought this smell was familiar .
i guess my sense of smell is as sharp as a dog' s .
who are you ?
me ?
i' m bijomaru mogami .
we just finished off three guys , now a newcomer .
i hate to break up such a nice romantic scene , but i want you to die .
she has nothing to do with us .
let her go .
sorry , no .
being slashed before the girl you like and exposing your misery will increase your pain and suffering all the more .
what did you say ?
have you ever thought of yourself being slashed ?
blood comes gushing out .
no matter how much you endure , it' s useless , you know you are going to die .
you want to die quickly , but you can' t .
what will you think then ?
one sword is broken .
that' s no good .
saru , loan your sword to him .
it' s no fun slaying an enemy who is not properly armed .
don' t worry .
we have no business with the girl .
i would be offended if you blame your defeat on fighting with only one sword .
do you know why this sword does not have a hand guard ?
i never defend .
i will immobilize you with one blow .
i was also taught to do as much .
i am totally thrilled !
you are quite quick .
but you failed to notice that you are cut ?
don' t come !
run !
don' t move !
stay and watch !
if you run , i will kil you .
it hurts , right ?
do you want to die quickly ?
i won' t let you die so easily .
enough of that .
the fight is over .
monkey face !
if you spoil my fun , you will die , too .
go ahead your bad taste creeps me out .
hyuga !
pity to leave her on her own .
bijomaru !
what significance is there to kill a girl who has nothing to do with this ?
what significance is there to live , anyway ?
shall we go ?
the next one better be stronger !
if not , then i will fight against you !
you got that , monkey face ?
he fought master fully .
we' il wait for nagato here .
yes .
he said you were sweet .
he wanted to stay with you a bit longer .
hyuga truly liked you .
what will you do now ?
will you seek revenge ?
the friend of your enemy will come to kill you .
a never ending story .
will you continue to kill each other forever ?
there are many evil people in the world .
someone has to kill them .
it doesn' t have to be you .
someone else can take care of it .
frightenly good swordsman ... he' s already killed one assassin .
but i can hardly like him .
in fact , i hate him .
don' t be so harsh .
saru , i want you to do something .
the final showdown will be in gamo .
i wonder how they are doing .
they are dead .
that' s not true .
they will definitely come .
master gessai ,
kiyomasa is heading for gamo .
gamo ?
it' s a ship he plans to leave gamo by ship .
we must get him in gamo , on land .
but the enemy is aware of our moves .
they won' t sit still .
i know .
we have no choice but to start the attack .
take these .
they might be of use at some point .
great !
be careful .
if they explode too close to you , you' il be blown to bits .
don' t touch me !
farewell .
i am counting on you .
you have a beautiful face .
how much is your ass ?
you want to die that much ?
don' t kill our allies recklessly .
money !
do you want more money ?
we need your help .
you guys help us a little , and more money and rewards will be yours .
look , when we cross those mountains , it' il only take 5 days to reach tangou .
i see .
you will get to see your mother soon , yae .
mother ...
you don' t know your mother ?
ever since i was little , i' ve been with master and everyone .
put this on .
girl' s clothing .
i prefer this .
this is more convenient for hiding my swords .
you are a girl .
i' m  girls don' t talk like that !
stay still !
there we go .
you look beautiful .
don' t say that !
azumi .
the swords don' t suit you .
i don' t want to see another person die .
kiyomasa is in the mansion .
let' s go .
master !
okay , spread out !
i won' t let you get away !
my nose is that of a dog' s .
it' s me , assholes !
that bastard .
i' il get him .
it' s incredible you made it this far .
why won' t you finish him off ?
if i kill him , he won' t be of any use to us as bait .
did you say bait ?
a few more assassins need to be killed .
master !
ukiha !
run , run away .
wait for the next opportunity !
run away , i want you to complete your mission .
what are you doing ?
run away quickly .
don' t worry about me .
go , go !
run !
smells nice .
be quiet .
how fortunate we are on a mountain like this .
which one should i pick ?
stop it .
stop it ?
okay , i' il stop it .
i pick you .
taro , i' il give you this one .
no matter how much i try to escape ... ... i can' t avoid it .
even if i don' t want to kill ... ... i am forced to kill .
you bitch !
i' m sorry , yae ...
i have no ...
... choice but this .
if it weren' t for master , i would never have lived .
he will protect you .
he always will .
i am going to wait for you .
i' il be waiting for you in tangou .
if you hadn' t been injured , our fight would have been more fun .
it' s a pity i can' t stay and fight your assassins .
saru , i' il leave the rest to you .
assassins are not going to show up no matter how long we wait .
such heavy security for a few assassins .
general kanbei is too cautious .
i' il be back .
hey wait a minute .
you just took a break a while ago .
it' s my turn now .
let' s decide with this .
i' il bet on tails .
then i' il bet on heads .
i hear the strongest one is still alive .
i can' t wait .
hey old man , are you still alive ?
stop it .
you annoy me constantly .
are you ready to die now ?
do you really think someone will come and rescue a dying old man like you ?
huh , old man ?
she' s already here .
azumi .
don' t come !
don' t !
no , you must come .
otherwise , he will die .
damn you !
wow !
incredible , she is just incredible
hey !
samurai bastards !
who are you aiming at ?
damn it , who do you think we are ?
just because you' re samurai , don' t act so damned important .
this is bullshit !
this is our town !
never mind about her , let' s get them !
this is getting to be fun !
what the hell is your problem ?
this fire ball will blow everyone up into pieces .
let' s ignite this !
oh , no ...
i am delighted .
no one is left to disturb us .
how splendid !
i didn' t even scratch you .
this is the first time i' ve had to defend .
you are wonderful .
why not die ?
master .
it' s over .
everything is over .
ukiha and nagara are both dead .
but i' m still here .
there is no further mission that you need to pursue .
from now on , live as you wish .
survive and keep on living .
master , i don' t know what to do without you .
you never used to cry .
it' s so quiet .
master .
master .
no , don' t .
master !
where do the stars go during the day ?
time to eat !
let' s go !
the stars are always there .
you can' t see them during the day , but the stars are always watching over us from up above the sky .
even if we get separated one day , we will always be together .
i' il be watching over you at all times .
kanbei .
it' s been a stimulating journey .
saru is not back yet .
we can' t let our guard down .
i can' t be scared of assassins !
when it' s time to die , you die .
don' t worry .
lord , you won' t die so easily .
your luck is too strong .
kanbei , the time has come for war .
that stupid old ieyasu ... we will blow him up into pieces .
you have done well in protecting me .
once we get home ,
i' il take you to a hot spring for some rest .
masterful !
lord !
nagara .
what are you doing ?
we are the only two left .
what shall we do now ?
nagamasa asano , kiyomasa kato .. . the next target is masayuki sanada .
this time , we' il probably be killed .
we are not going to die .
we will survive .
everyone is with us .
let' s go .
