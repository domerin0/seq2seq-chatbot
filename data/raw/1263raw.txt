no way they' re going to bring those automated vacuum loaders here .
when they installed them on 1 4 and 23 , they said it was a temporary experiment .
well , they' re still there .
some temporary !
hand me that coupler , would you ?
what about wooton ?
he' s a shop steward .
what' d he say ?
i' il tell you what wooton said .
zip .
that' s what he said .
they' re always trying to pull something .
that' s a lot of crap !
they' ve run a 7 worker shift since they installed those loaders on 1 4 and 23 .
hey , you read the contract .
8 workers per shift .
that' s what it says .
eight .
in black and white .
so they want to get cute , i can get cute , too .
i want a meeting .
maybe we need a new shop steward .
bylaws are bylaws .
can' t they regulate these suits ?
it' s minus 1 75 degrees .
we broil our asses off .
where' s your other suit ?
in the shop .
put some mylar over the sensor .
it steps down the heating coil and you' il be cooler .
really ?
no , moron , i made it up .
oh , god !
i hate spiders !
kill it !
kill it !
hey , tarlow , what' s eating you ?
get it off !
get it off my leg !
somebody please help me !
tarlow , what' s the matter with you ?
get what off ?
spider !
please help me !
get it off !
spider ?
have you popped your cork ?
how can there be a spider here ?
there' s nothing alive here .
get it off !
oh , get it off !
oh , god !
very funny .
we' re not falling for nothing .
cut the garbage and get back to work .
oh , god , it' s getting inside !
get it out !
get it out !
somebody please help me !
somebody help me get it out of my suit !
is it the buttermilk kind ?
i' m afraid so .
they were running out of the other kind .
i can hardly talk with these braces .
it won' t be much longer .
how much longer ?
pretty soon .
how soon ?
how soon for what ?
till i get my braces off .
you want crooked teeth ?
i don' t mind them .
you' il be missing some teeth in a minute if you don' t eat breakfast .
pretend it' s not buttermilk .
pretend i ate them .
marshal , it' s lowell .
the night watch went okay .
nothing much .
just a couple of drunks .
we' il watch it tonight .
that' s it .
i' il be in your office at 18 : 00 .
marshal , it' s montone .
nothing more on that incident ... ... in the mine yesterday .
some guy went whacko .
the company' s shipping the body back , or what' s left , on today' s shuttle .
it' s impossible to do an autopsy .
you should have seen that mess !
anyway , definitely no homicide .
there were two witnesses when it happened .
it happens every once in a while up here .
some people let this place get to them .
so , that' s about it .
tell your wife that transportation got the tickets for her .
i' il see you when you get to the office .
and don ' t worry , you' il get used to it .
what tickets ?
mr. and mrs. reynolds , the nice couple from the bakery .
they wanted tickets for the weekly shuttle for a friend .
so i said i' d see what i could do .
well , i' d better go .
see you for dinner , sport .
and remember , 7 pages of math .
i promise .
you be good today .
i will .
look , i know this is a lousy assignment .
and i know what it is for you .
how difficult .
just give it a chance .
it won' t be so bad .
i know .
i love you .
i love you , too .
we' ve only been here two weeks .
it' il get better .
i promise .
i got to go .
you smell good .
and finally , i realize that i' m new here . . . . . . and i' ve got to get to know you , and you' ve got to get to know me .
i just hope that i can justify your confidence .
thank you .
i really wowed them .
had them eating out of your hand .
are there any questions ?
marshal ?
flo spector . . . . . . accounting services .
i' m sure i speak for all of us . . . . . . in extending our welcome to you and your family .
if mrs. o' niel or your son should need anything , tell them to call me .
thank you very much .
i' il be sure and tell my wife .
her name is carol .
i see there are no more questions .
i add my welcome to marshal o' niel .
i' m sure we all agree he' il have a pleasant tour .
right now , he' s just getting started here .
soon he' il see that this is like every other mining town .
there' s never much trouble .
i' m glad to hear it .
just remember that these men and women work hard .
very hard .
since i' ve been the general manager , we' ve broken all productivity records .
we' re becoming the leading con amalgamate operation .
and everyone in this room has received the bonus checks to prove it .
good work only comes from contented people .
i work these people hard . . . . . . and i let them play hard .
when it comes time for them to let off steam . . . . . . you have to allow them some room .
long as no harm' s done , just give them a little room .
understand what i' m saying , marshal ?
thanks for the advice , mr. sheppard .
we' re all professionals .
i' m sure we are .
drop by my office .
we' il talk some more .
i' il do that .
don' t get your nose out of joint .
what was that all about ?
it' s just his way .
i don' t like his way .
don' t mess with him .
he' s an asshole .
a very powerful asshole .
don' t mess with him .
he' s just trying to sniff you out .
the last marshal kept things running smooth .
that' s all they want .
things run smooth , they make their money .
nobody' s here for their health , and they certainly aren' t here for the scenery .
what is that guy doing ?
he' s going in the elevator !
he' s going in the elevator without a suit on !
carol ?
i' m trying to keep my composure .
and like everything i do , i think i' m messing this up .
i despise these message things .
i' m just such a coward .
i couldn ' t look at your face and say what i' m about to say .
i just couldn ' t .
if you were in front of me , i' d change my mind .
and i don ' t want to change my mind .
i love you .
please know that .
i hadn ' t planned this .
i really hadn ' t .
i just can ' t take it anymore .
that' s what it amounts to .
i know we' ve been over this so many times before .
the same crying from me , and the same assurances from you .
that the next place will be different .
but it never is .
it can ' t be .
so yesterday , something snapped in me .
i just couldn ' t bear to see paulie ... ... clatter around yet another bleak place .
i just couldn ' t .
he' s a child .
he' s never set foot on earth .
never !
he looks at pictures and reads books of earth ... ... all day long .
and he hides them from you so your feelings won ' t be hurt .
don ' t you see he deserves a childhood ?
he deserves a chance to breathe air , real outside air ... ... where you don ' t broil or explode .
air that smells like life !
not like a ventilating unit !
i' m just not as good as you are .
i don ' t think it' s worth it .
so i' m taking paulie back home .
i love you .
you don ' t deserve this .
you deserve the best .
i' ve just got to go now , my love .
i' il contact you ... ... in a few days from the space station before we finally leave for earth .
what do we have here ?
what' s happening with the purser' s area ?
we' ve put monitors on the whole area for 36 hours . . . . . . and things have been quiet .
keep the monitors on for two weeks .
and the detonators ?
they were found .
where ?
i don' t know .
the foreman reported them found . . . . . . then told me to forget about it .
nelson , we' re talking about nuclear detonators .
you just don' t lose them and then find them .
you lose your comb , then find it .
not detonators .
i want to know where they were found and who found them .
get it ?
good for you , nelson .
slater , what about the incident in the mine elevator ?
nothing much to tell , sarge .
some cupcake named cane decided he didn' t need an environment suit .
they' re still sponging him off the elevator walls .
he was alone .
nobody near enough to have thrown him in .
some guys tried to get into the airlock . . . . . . except he' d sealed it .
no way it was homicide .
had to have been a suicide .
did he leave a note ?
i beg your pardon ?
did he leave a note ?
none that we know of , sir .
then how do you know it was suicide ?
there' s no other explanation .
he knew what he was doing , that' s for sure .
you can' t fall into an airlock and then an elevator .
you have to open hatches , press buttons , close hatches .
it' s the only explanation .
thank you .
okay .
fanning .
what about the pump station ?
just a fight .
we took them both in to cool off .
they straightened out soon .
gil ?
pretty quiet .
couple of calls about noise .
nothing much .
who ordered all these pressure packs ?
this is a mine , not a war .
you did , doctor .
i said 1 00 .
not 1 , 000 .
i said 1 00 , which can' t be mistaken for anything except 1 00 .
it doesn' t sound remotely iike 1 , 000 .
listen !
you' il hear what i mean .
one thousand .
one hundred .
totally different .
you think they sound the same ?
who are you , anyway ?
are you dr. lazarus ?
two aspirins and call me in the morning .
doctor joke .
are you the new marshal ?
yes .
i' d like to talk to you .
i got an alibi .
four people will swear we were playing poker .
i never heard that one before .
that' s really funny .
sorry .
yesterday , a man went into the atmosphere without his pressure suit .
a couple of days before , another man cut his suit open on purpose .
it happens here .
how often ?
i don' t know .
it just happens here .
why ?
i' m not a psychiatrist .
i can' t tell you why .
some people can' t take it here after awhile .
did you do autopsies ?
no .
why not ?
the company wanted the bodies shipped out quickly .
secondly , when one exposes himself to zero pressure atmosphere . . . . . . there isn' t a lot to inspect .
in the third place , you' re becoming a nuisance .
yes , i know .
give me a report of all of the incidents happening over the past 6 months .
i' d like it soon , or i might just kick your nasty ass all over this floor .
that' s a marshal joke .
it' s open .
i didn' t know what you' d like to eat , so i brought everything .
listen , you got to eat something .
can' t catch crooks on an empty stomach .
i know how you feel .
i do .
the second time i did a tour , my wife had skipped off . . . . . . with some computer programmer .
i have two daughters .
they call the programmer daddy .
my wife said she was happy .
i said , " happy ?
the guy looks so boring .
she said he was not mr. excitement , but he was always home .
you can' t argue with that .
try the food , it' s not bad .
i will .
the hookers are nice .
they can help when you' re lonely .
i' m sure .
i get the feeling i' m bombing .
no , you' re not .
i appreciate what you' re doing .
i really do .
no , it' s just . . .
. . . i' d like to be on my own for now .
i understand .
marshal . . . . . . if you need anything . . . . . . if you just want to talk . . .
. . . please call me .
we' ve got a response on your request .
i' m trying to keep my composure ... ... and like everything else i do , i think i' m messing this up .
i despise these message things .
i' m just such a coward .
i couldn ' t look at your face and say what i' m about to say .
i just couldn ' t .
if you were in front of me , i' d change my mind .
what ?
how bad ?
i' il be right there .
marshal , he' s in the west wing .
sergeant montone is waiting for you .
he' s in a leisure compartment roughing up a hooker .
she pushed the alarm .
when i responded , he said he had a knife and would kill her if i didn' t leave .
a crane operator named sagan .
been here 1 1 months , never caused trouble .
how' s the girl ?
she' s still alive .
is he stoned ?
beats me .
some guys like to slap hookers around .
this is marshal o' niel .
let that girl out and no one' s going to hurt you .
now listen to me !
just listen .
i can' t go away and you know that .
now nobody' s going to hurt you .
if you want to talk , we' il talk .
i won' t try to break in . . . . . . and you don' t do anything crazy with that girl .
okay ?
go away !
get me a maintenance worker .
yes , sir .
which vent leads to the air conditioning duct for number two compartment ?
open it .
open the hydraulic valves to release the door locks when i tell you .
sagan , can you hear me ?
i hear you !
i' il explain this to you . . . . . . very carefully .
i will release the hydraulic pressure on the door locks .
it will open this door .
you cannot keep the doors closed . . . . . . and stay in .
why don' t you just come out and make it easy ?
the second that door opens , i' il kill her !
i' m going to slice her !
i hate her !
i won' t argue with you .
and i won' t trick you .
i' m going to count down from ten to one .
at one , the door will spring open slowly .
i will not rush in .
i will not shoot you .
i don' t want to hurt anybody , including you .
whatever the problem is . . . . . . we can work it out , without hurting anybody .
you' re going to kill me .
no , i' m not .
you have my word .
you also have my word that if you kill that girl . . . . . . i will kill you .
now i' m going to count down from ten . . . . . . to one , slowly .
just do as i say .
ten . . .
. . . nine . . .
well , he turned .
i saw the knife .
jaw looks broken .
maybe the nose .
contusions .
neck wounds look superficial .
jesus christ , who did this to her ?
a worker .
went nuts .
it happens here , remember ?
i got that list .
she' s bleeding in the abdomen .
why didn' t you bring it to my office ?
i don' t make house calls .
she' il be all right ?
maybe , if you let me do my job .
28 in the last 6 months .
i wonder in the 6 months before .
24 .
i' ve got initiative .
good for you .
you want to know how many in the 6 months before that ?
two .
are you sure ?
i' m unpleasant , not stupid .
of course i' m sure , i can count .
well , what do you think ?
i don' t know .
almost nobody has both oars in the water , as far as i' m concerned .
why people start to lose their marbles in greater numbers isn' t so mystifying .
i don' t know why more of them didn' t do it sooner .
where are the bodies sent ?
they usually ship them out on the next shuttle .
they wrap them up and jettison them halfway to the station .
burial at sea and all that crap .
lazarus ?
this is o ' niel .
i' il see you in the hospital right away .
do you know what time it is ?
you' d better be dying .
is this going to take long ?
you' re kidding me .
that doesn' t mean much .
blood type , cholesterol count .
this blood is from a dead person .
very good .
no alcohol .
he ate dinner .
protein , carbohydrates . . . . . . more carbohydrates .
he didn' t eat his vegetables .
no nicotine .
some tranquilizers .
yeah , they' re company tranquilizers .
standard issue .
blood sugar and hemoglobin are normal .
hello .
what ?
i don' t know .
shit .
such a smart piece of equipment , and a wreck like me trying to run it .
you know , you haven' t your medical all star here .
company doctors are like ships ' doctors .
most are one shuttle flight ahead of a malpractice suit .
something' s there , isn' t it ?
maybe .
i spend my days dispensing tranquilizers to the workers . . . . . . and certifying that the prostitutes don' t have syphilis .
i don' t know how to analyze a new molecule .
hello .
is it a drug ?
you just won a prize .
it' s some kind of narcotic .
nothing i' ve ever seen before .
synthetic .
bingo .
polydichloric euthimal .
those stupid bastards are taking polydichloric euthimal !
it' s an amphetamine .
strongest thing you ever saw .
makes you feel wonderful .
you do 1 4 hours of work in 6 hours .
that kind of nonsense .
especially manual labor .
it makes you work like a horse .
the army tested it a few years ago .
it made everybody work all right .
then it made them psychotic .
it takes a while , ten , maybe eleven months .
and then it fries your brain .
you said it' s synthetic .
can it be made here ?
no .
impossible .
it has to have been shipped in .
no autopsies .
so nobody knows anything .
the workers are producing more , so the company' s making bigger profits .
they' re not about to ask any questions .
it' s quite a setup .
don' t say anything to anybody about this .
i did good , didn' t i ?
for a wreck .
you did good .
9 7 .
do you want to tell me about it ?
tell you about what ?
sheppard .
what about him ?
how deep are you in ?
not too deep .
i' m paid to look the other way .
you don' t do anything bad , you just don' t do anything good .
i' m going to bust sheppard .
are you serious ?
this is no place for heroes .
you try to bust him . . . . . . you' re messing with more than you think .
you' re talking about the general manager .
he' s a real hotshot here .
it' s big money , people and places that we only know from letterheads .
this guy is connected with more than just the company .
i mean it .
there' s some serious stuff involved .
what will this prove ?
i' m not trying to prove anything .
that stuff they sell is killing people .
what will you do with me ?
i don' t know .
you want me to resign ?
no .
just don' t come between sheppard and me .
just keep taking your money . . . . . . and looking the other way .
i don' t want you .
i want him .
your serve .
think it over .
he' s in cell 36 .
has he said anything ?
not a peep .
anyone ask about him ?
if anyone does , i want to know .
this is o' niel .
the report says you were carrying 4 ounces of euthimal . . .
. . . which is 400 doses .
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
of course you don' t .
how much does sheppard pay you ?
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
you' il love it here , though some start to go crazy at night . . . . . . when you can' t feel the floor .
and sometimes the air tether gets knotted and a man suffocates .
but that doesn' t happen too often .
o' niel , piss off !
i like that .
you' re real quick with a comeback .
i' ve got you nailed .
i' ve got witnesses and evidence .
you' il be shipped back and do time that will make this place look like a picnic !
now don' t do a deal with me .
don' t get yourself a reduced sentence .
just do your hard time while sheppard laughs his ass off .
i' ve got to hand it to you .
you' re pretty sharp .
see you around , tough guy .
nobody talks to him .
nobody touches him .
i mean nobody , you understand ?
i understand .
you know something ?
i can hit a seven iron 500 yards in this place .
fix yourself a drink .
no , thanks .
you' ve been busy .
so have you .
how much do you want ?
how much ?
just what we need here , a goddamn hero .
you know something ?
this rug has a slight break to the left .
let me tell you what you' re dealing with .
i run a franchise .
i' m hired to dig as much ore as possible out of this hellhole .
there' s a guy like me on every mining operation all over this system .
my hookers are clean , some good looking .
my booze isn' t watered .
the workers are happy .
when the workers are happy , they dig more ore .
they get more bonus money .
when they dig more ore , the company' s happy .
when the company' s happy , i' m happy .
sounds wonderful .
nothing here is wonderful .
it works .
that' s enough .
now every year a new marshal comes to start his tour .
they all know the score .
you know the score .
you' re no different .
if this hero routine is to get your price up , i' il think about it .
what are you after ?
you .
what is it with guys like you ?
if you were such a goddamn super cop . . . . . . what are you doing on a company mining operating like io ?
they didn' t send you here as a reward for your sterling service .
you know that and i know that .
i read your record .
you' ve got a big mouth .
that' s why you' re sent from one toilet to the next .
me ?
i don' t plan on spending the rest of my life doing this .
well , good for you .
now , look , this charade of yours is silly .
you meddle , i want you to know what you' re meddling with .
you got something to prove , prove it to yourself , not to me .
i' il see you around .
if you' re looking for money , you' re smarter than you look !
if you' re not , you' re a lot dumber .
i' m probably a lot dumber .
that can be very dangerous .
all right , tough guy , time to talk .
what' s the matter ?
sun in your eyes ?
well , well , well , if it isn' t the law !
sheppard , guess what i just found in a meat locker ?
you know , i have a feeling that you' il tell me even if i don' t guess .
250 pounds of hamburger named yario that works for you .
i also found your shipment of pde .
i threw the hamburger in jail and the pde in the toilet .
or the other way around ?
i can' t remember .
you' ve been busy .
yeah , are you proud of me ?
real proud .
good shot .
you destroyed the shipment ?
you do have a flair for the dramatic .
was it expensive ?
more than you can ever imagine .
you could be out of business .
you know , i' ve misjudged you .
you' re not stupid .
you' re crazy .
you think you caused an inconvenience ?
is that what you think ?
why don' t you go home and polish your badge ?
you' re dealing with grownups here .
you' re out of your league .
whoever sent that shipment will be mad that you lost it .
grownups have no sense of humor .
i' d play a firm eight iron there .
just swing easy .
you' re dead .
do you hear me ?
i hear you .
bello ws , this is sheppard .
what the hell' s been going on down there ?
just a little trouble .
i can take care of it .
send me a few of your best men .
and the two you had ?
send me the men !
i' il straighten everything out .
my people are not going to like this .
i' il have it straightened out .
when do you need the men ?
on the next shuttle .
i' il see what i can do .
i' il call you back later .
what have we got ?
break in at the women' s quarters .
can' t tell if it was a pervert or a burglary .
the guy was surprised and ran like hell .
any prints ?
nothing clear .
what else ?
not much .
a hell of a fight in the cafeteria .
a broken nose and teeth was the damage .
both guys are cooling out in the tank .
where' s your sergeant stripes ?
well , it' s only been a couple of days since sergeant montone
you' re the new sergeant .
you wear your stripes .
put them on now .
this is bello ws .
you' ve got the men you want and it wasn ' t easy .
my people are very unhappy .
this could cause trouble for us on the other operations .
if the company got wind of what' s going on , they' d clamp down like a vise .
they can ' t afford to lose their franchise .
it could put my people out of business .
and my people like being in business .
tell them not to worry .
how good are the men ?
the best .
they' ve left on the shuttle arriving sunday .
they have their own weapons ?
yes .
the target is o ' niel .
you better not mess this up !
i won ' t .
it' s your party .
yes , it is .
how much help will he have ?
none .
you sure ?
yes , i' m sure .
no one here will stick their neck out for anyone .
once word spreads that these guys are pros ... ... there' il be no trouble .
i' ve got someone on the inside who ' il spread the word .
don ' t worry .
he' s a dead man .
i' il tell you , if this doesn ' t work out ... ... the next guys who come will be coming for you .
no sweat .
i' il call you when it' s over .
how many can i count on ?
well , i don' t know , sir .
what about you ?
well , you see . . .
. . . most of us are . . .
. . . most are young .
we have families .
i have a family .
i know where we stand .
thank you , sergeant .
that' s pretty good .
playing by yourself and losing .
i' d join you in this dumb game if i could play sitting down .
yes , i' m well , thank you .
pretty busy .
seems there' s some flu going around .
you' d be surprised how many workers will be sick this sunday .
it' s your actual epidemic .
are you going to be sick this sunday ?
if you want sterling character , you' re in the wrong place .
if you' re the guy you' re supposed to be , you wouldn' t stick around .
that' s why they sent you .
maybe they made a mistake .
i was afraid you' d say something like that .
you really think you' re making a difference ?
then why , for god' s sake ?
because . . .
. . . maybe they are right .
they send me here to this pile of shit because they think i belong here .
i want to find out . . .
. . . if they' re right .
a whole machine works because everybody does what they' re supposed to .
and i found out . . . . . . i was supposed to be something i didn' t like .
that' s what' s in the program .
that' s my rotten little part , in the rotten machine .
i don' t like it .
so i' m going to find out if they' re right .
your wife is one stupid lady .
you want to go get drunk ?
at least you have some sense left .
hello , there .
i' m doing it again .
i' ve had so much time to prepare what to say ... ... and here i am looking at your face , and my mouth has gone to mush .
how' s paul ?
he' s fine .
i promised him ... ... he could talk to you .
he' s in the next room .
are you well ?
i' m okay .
paulie and i ....
the reservations have come through .
we' re flying home .
the reservations are for three .
that was thoughtful .
i can' t .
why ?
i just can' t .
i wish i could .
what is so important ?
i' m too tired to try to explain .
you' re making a difference ?
do you think what you' re doing is worth giving up your family for ?
you' re a stubborn son of a bitch .
something' s wrong there , isn ' t it ?
no .
i know you' re in some kind of trouble .
when you speak in sentences ... ... of less than two words , you' re in trouble .
i know it .
i' m okay .
damn you .
take care of yourself .
you can come in now , paulie .
i love you .
hi , paul .
how are you doing ?
great !
mommy let me stay up late because this is when the call came through .
i miss you .
i miss you , too .
mommy says as soon as you get done , you' il come home with us .
as soon as i get done .
what' s it like on earth ?
it' s beautiful .
you' re going to see many wonderful things .
and you' il have friends to play with .
mommy says that on the flight , they put you to sleep for more than a year .
that' s true .

in a mining town ... ... on the second moon of jupiter ... ... something deadly is happening .
pretty soon you' il see that this is just like every other mining town .
i work these people hard . . .
. . . and i let them play hard .
there' s never much trouble .
we' re all professionals .
i' m sure we are .
we' ve only been here 2 weeks .
it' il get better .
i promise .
nothing more on that mine incident .
it looks like some guy just went wacko .
it happens here .
how often ?
i don' t know .
it just happens here .
why ?
i' m not a psychiatrist .
i can' t tell you why .
some people can' t take it here after awhile .
what' s that guy think he' s doing ?
no way it could' ve been homicide .
had to have been a suicide .
28 in the last six months .
did you do autopsies ?
no .
then how do you know that it was a suicide ?
there' s no other explanation .
when one is exposed to zero pressure , there isn' t a whole lot left to inspect .
something' s there , isn' t it ?
maybe .
try and meddle , i want you to know what you' re meddling with .
you' re out of your league .
you know , we' re grownups here .
bingo .
marshal . . . . . . you' re dead .
if you' re the kind of guy you' re supposed to be . . .
. . . you wouldn' t stick around .
that' s why they sent you here .
maybe they made a mistake .
outland .
the ultimate enemy is still . .. ... man .
