this isn' t a typical high school .
at john hughes , there are no cliques , no exclusive social groups .
you' re accepted for you , not who you hang out with .
we' il divide into groups so you can get to know your peers .
let' s get all you jocks in one group ... ... and get you slutty girls over here by me .
hey , how you doing ?
welcome .
you losers should hang out in the back .
that clearly includes you .
come on , get back there .
take a look at the kid standing beside you .
they' re your only friends for the next four years .
okay , let' s move it , people !
you need to start dating .
i don' t date .
you know that .
janey , you know dad' s rule .
i can' t have sex before you .
i don' t conform to typical high school norms .
i read sylvia plath , listen to bikini kill and eat tofu .
i' m a unique rebel .
more like you' re a lesbo .
mitch , leave your sister alone .
thank you , daddy .
if janey wants to be a rug muncher , that' s her decision .
go !
fight !
win !
nice combination , crissy !
i' ve been meaning to get that fixed .
later , dad .
i' il be late to pick you up .
why ?
a job interview ?
no , honey .
i' il probably just be way too drunk .
that' s good .
no drinking and driving .
oh , i' il be driving .
i' il just be too drunk to remember .
okay .
bye , daddy .
bye , pumpkin head .

but you' il find that the students are very accepting .
i am so happy to be in america .
you have a sunny disposition .

prom queen , material .
austin , she' s an illusion .
you take away the makeup , the clothes ... ... the way she wears her hair , the smell of her perfume ... ... that cute face she makes when she' s tonguing my balls ....
look , she' s replaceable .
given the right look , the right boyfriend ...
... any girl could be prom queen .
i smell a bet .
jakey , jakey , about to make a big ... ... mistakey .
i' il pick the most hopeless girl at this school ... ... and i' il bet that you can' t turn her into prom queen .
you' re on , austin .
i' il bet you lose that bet ... ... but learn a much more valuable lesson , and win .
in life , that is .
you' re both on .
all right .
let' s find you a prom queen , mr. let' s find me a prom queen .
what about her ?
baby' s got back .
hunch , that is .
no , way too easy .
i have no pigment any girl with a guitar is hot .
i need sunscreen
even a hippie albino .
she could be prom queen .
what about the fratelli sisters ?
so they' re slightly disfigured and connected .
but combined , those two make up one pretty decent chick .

i' m looking for somebody really messed up .
i' m talking about a real shitbomb .
well , bombs away .
no , no , no , anyone but her !

anorexic , superficial ?
a whore who lacks any real long term goals ?

we' ve disgraced ourselves and our families .
i sense the morale' s a little low .
i say we make a pact ... ... right here , right now .
before the end of the year , we all get laid !
we always make that pact .
we' ve been waiting for this since puberty .
two weeks ago !
i just got first hair on ball .
i don' t think you understand .
we' il become the masters of our sexual destiny .
no longer will our penises remain flaccid and unused .
no longer steal grandfather' s porn .
no longer will we use blindfolds when we jerk each other off .
all right , that' s it .
what in god' s name is going on ?
what was that ruckus ?
i no hear ruckus .
i heard a ruckus .
can you describe this ruckus , sir ?
you better watch your tongue , young man !
we were just sitting here .

well , who is this guy ?
his name is blane .
he' s a senior .
he' s so beautiful .
janey ?
sweetheart ?
hi , daddy .
is something wrong ?
you were quiet at dinner .
you were passed out on the table .
listen , honey ... ... l may not always be coherent or conscious ... ... but i know when my girl' s got something on her mind .
well , there is this popular boy , jake .
oh , sweetie .
jake knocked you up , didn' t he ?
no , he asked me out .
do you like him ?
are you attracted to him ?
i mean , would you give him head ?
he is kind of cute , but ... ... he' s always been a total jerk .
it' s weird that he' s talking to me now .
especially after you' ve packed on a couple of pounds .
what do you think i should do ?
look , sweetie .
i never want you to do anything that compromises who you are ... ... because you' re very , very special to me .
if jake is only asking you out to get into your pants ... ... well , then i' d say ... ... go out with him .
you could certainly use the popularity points .
and if jake likes you ... ... then maybe those kids' il quit throwing bags of shit on the porch .
i feel better .
thanks for the advice , daddy .
that' s what i' m here for , pumpkin tits .
i need to ask you a favor .
it' s about time .
no , not that .
you' re the cruelest girl in high school .
you' re the only one who can help trick janey into liking me .
that girl with the glasses and the ponytail ?
don' t forget the paint covered overalls .
well ... ... it' s going to be difficult .
but i think i can help you .
sit .
for a price .
and this time , i don' t want your car .
i want you .
catherine , that' s disgusting .
you' re my sister .
only by blood .
what is wrong with this family ?
hey , do you want my help or not ?
there are three things you need to do ... ... to have janey eating out of your hand .
first , you earn her trust .
come on , leave him alone !
hey !
come on , guys , back off .
that' s enough , okay ?
you little shit .
don' t you guys mess with him again .
once you' ve got her trust , it' s time to make her feel special .
pick a song with hername in it .
that always works .
she' s got a gun !
janey' s got a gun !
take it easy , miss .
wait .
get back here !
hold her down .
give me your hand !
just give us the gun , janey .
afteryou' ve made her feel special ... ... it' s time to put the icing on the cake .
i' m really glad you showed up , janey .
the only reason i came here was to tell you to leave me alone .
you know , i was just making a snack .
you want one ?
no .
listen , jake
i' il be right back .
hungry ?
i don' t like sundaes .
it' s not a sundae , it' s a banana split .
i don' t like those , either .
goodbye , jake .
i left some money on the kitchen counter .
emergency numbers are by the phone .
no parties .
i know , dad .
keg coming through .
hey .
what' s up , man ?
we' re trusting you , preston .
where do you want the speakers ?
in the dining room .
you guys should hit the road .
i' m taking your ferrari to buy hookers .
we' il call you later to check in .
i' il be so high , i won' t know where the phone is .
that' s my boy .
jake , what are you doing here ?
i' m taking you to preston' s big party .
i can' t .
i' m not dressed to go to a party .
i' m a complete mess .
i' d say you' re one big fucking train wreck .
do i know you ?
that' s it .
i' ve got it .
what ?
it might seem crazy , but you' il have to trust me .
that' s it .
i did it .
i' m a miracle worker .
gentlemen ... ... may i present to you the new and improved ... ... janey briggs .
congratulations .
you just got your first slow motion entrance .
i' m okay !
janey ?
come on out of there , honey .

i thought she' d be here by now .

reggie ray , have you seen janey anywhere ?
it' s a good night for smoking .
ain' t that right , sausage ?
okay , now close your eyes and wet your lips .
are you for real ?
do you want to learn or not ?
i guess .

that wasn' t so scary .
it was nothing .
okay .
let' s try again .
only this time , i' m gonna stick my tongue in your mouth .
and when i do that , i want you to massage my tongue with yours .
and that' s what first base is .
okay .
eyes closed .
that was cool .
now ... ... have you ever eaten pussy before ?
you call this a party ? !
i' m a golden goddess !
show us how drunk you are !
go for it !
you' re a unique rebel , janey !
janey , are you all right ?
i told you not to let me drink .
i gave you a nonalcoholic beer .
what the hell are you doing here ?
i was invited .
look , you may have lost those glasses and that ponytail thing ... ... but you' re still a loser .
look at that .
oh , my god .
that' s going to stain .
you' re not going to cry now , are you ?
look , you can' t just start a slow clap at any old time .
you gotta wait for the right moment .
when is it the right moment ?
you' il know .
nobody' s allowed down here .
janey , i just thought
how did you get in here ?
i deadbolted the door .
there' s a hole in the side of your house .
who' s that ?
it' s my mother .
you have her eyes .
she died when i was 6 .
i' m sorry .
i remember it like it was yesterday .
christmas , 1 989 .
dad had been fired from the zipper factory .
mom was pulling in tricks to make ends meet .
daniel day lewis won an oscar for my left foot .
and all i wanted was a little betsy wetsy doll .
i remember those .
push her belly , she' d piss all over herself .
she said she was going out to get my dad a bottle of gin ... ... but i knew she was going to get me that present .
it was raining really hard that night ... ... and the roads were slippery .
oh , god , janey .
a car accident .
no .
cancer .
cooking and cleaning and breast feeding mitch .
it' s in the past .
think about your future .
look how talented you are .
i have this dream ofjust hopping on a plane and going to paris .
there' s an art school but i can' t afford it .
unless i raise $26, 000 before the admissions cutoff .
my parents give a scholarship to girls who can' t get into art school .
really ?
that' s amazing .
this year we gave it to lupe , the mexican finger painter .
i think you' d really like her work .
sometimes i wish my life was a fairy tale ... ... and some guy would come and take me away .
my eyes were shut .
and we couldn' t even
i' m going to go .
okay .
congratulations to the men and women nominated forprom queen .
think you' il be prom queen ?
well , think again , janey .
you put the " ass " in " embarrassment .
the " boo " in " taboo .
and the " suck " in " iiposuction .
is that the best you can do ?
no .
you also put the " brat " in " bratwurst .
and the " eew " in " jujitsu .
and the " ism " in " this is all just a defense mechanism .
so i told her , " take the old lady and send your mama back .
so , you asked your four eyed circus freak to the prom yet ?
we resent that !
why don' t you just drop it , austin ?
jake made a few paint stains in his pants thinking about janey .
it' s just a bet .
