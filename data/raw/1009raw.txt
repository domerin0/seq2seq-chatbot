peter , it' s fine .
i had breakfast with sammy this morning .
why did you have breakfast with sammy ?
because he helps people invest their money , that' s why .
peter , my brother is an addict and a thief .

i' m starving .

he never rests .
i' il sleep when i' m dead .
don' t say that .
what' s in your bag ?
i found some stuff in my closet .

clothes .
oh , they won' t fit you anymore , darling .
i' il get them altered .
they' re back in fashion .
if you say so .
mom , whatever happened to the feinstadts ?
they retired to florida .
not too far from your father .
did they have brothers and sisters ?
why do you ask ?
i saw the name feinstadt the other day .
i just wondered if scott maybe had a cousin running around somewhere .
it was just the two of them .
which made what happened to scott so devastating .
still , the way she carried on about his artistic genius ... mom !
it is the worst thing that can happen to a woman ... losing a child .
i see rachel feinstadt when she comes back to visit ... and she' s lost her bloom .
do you remember how beautiful she was when she was your age ?
my age ?
yeah .
when you and scott were dating ... rachel would have been about your age .
did scott ever use the phrase " just add water life " with you ?
who ?
scott .
scott was 20 years ago , wheeze .
i couldn' t tell you what i had for breakfast this morning .
just this one thing .
what ?
are you writing your memoirs ?
no , i just ...
i saw it somewhere .
it sounded familiar .
i wasn' t sure if it was him .
where did you see it ?
magazine .
did he say it ?
yeah .
yeah .
he used to say it .
it was part of his whole thing , you know ?
you know , that sensitive artist thing .
like , " hey , i make art , so you don' t get to yell at me ... for making you wait at the ihop for two fucking hours .
i forgot that part .
what part ?
being late part .
and just when you were ready to write him off ... poof !
he' d show up with that shit eating grin on his face .

you' re into abstracts .
i' m not abstract .
i mean , it' s just ... it' s not what i do .

how was your time at risd ?
good .
you know ?
it was good .
good people .
good times .
but , you know , at the end of the day ... it' s rhode island , you know , so i guess i needed more room .

louise , ever since i can remember ...
i have had this thing inside of me , you know ... and it just keeps coming and coming ... there' s no stopping it .

yeah .
promise me i' il see you tomorrow night ?
i promise .
you changed .
yep .
louise harrington .
what are you up to ?
what do you mean ?
i' ve been calling all over the place .
well , i ...
i took a long lunch .
well , i heard back from greg .
who ?
he called me this morning !
what did he say ?
" what did he say ? " wheezy .
he called me from a hotel .
a hotel ?
mm hmm !
subtle this man is not .
he calls me and basically says , " come over for an afternoon of hot , nostalgic sex .
oh , my god !
what did you say ?
i said , " order up some of that room service shrimp cocktail , honey .
i' m comin ' over !
no .
yes !
two hours ago i' m in the suv .
i' m actually on my way to meet greg ... at the radisson , no less .
you should' ve seen me , wheeze .
i' m driving barefoot ... with these " fuck me" shoes bouncing on the passenger seat .
it' s a good hair day .
all systems are go .
and ?
and two blocks from the hotel ...
i turn around and drive home .
why , miss ?
why ?
because the last time greg saw me naked i was 22 .
i was still perfect , wheezy .
he' s picturing me as a girl .
if i let him see me now , the girl is gone forever .
she gets replaced by a housewife who' s had twins .
i mean , you should see my bazooms , wheeze .
it' s like national geographic over here .
oh , come on , miss .
you always needed a bra .
ouchy !
wait a minute .
you' re getting laid , aren' t you ?
what are you talking about ?
i know you .
your voice changes when you' re getting laid .
spill the beans , wheezy .
who is he ?
i don' t know .
you look great .
i forgot about your groupies .
oh , yeah .
they' re newly intoxicated with the wonders of the universe .
remember when we were like that ?
i remember .
getting you was like winning a prize .
i outshone all the other girls .
you sure did .
mm hmm .
still do .
how are you , lou ?
well ... i' m wonderful , actually .
you look wonderful .
and how are you , peter ?
i' m good .
good .
i' m happy .
happy ?
mm .
lou , i didn' t go to ... to oregon last weekend by myself .
what ?
i went with somebody else .
i wanted to tell you myself because ...
i didn' t want you finding out some other way .
thank you .
is she a student ?
no .
i met her through sammy , actually .
do you have a cigarette ?
you don' t smoke .
i do , sometimes .
thanks .
lou , some months back i ...
i went to sammy ... for help .
you told me .
this is different .
i have an addiction .
you have an addiction ?
yeah .
an addiction to what ?
to sex .
sex ?
you have an addiction to sex ?
yeah .
it started before ... before we met .
but , peter , the last three years of our marriage ... we didn' t have sex at all .
oh , god .
every semester i swore to myself , this will not happen again .
and then a list of names would be left on my desk ... and just even looking at the names would start the whole cycle over again .
but that' s how we met .
i was a name on a list .
lou , i swear to you ... you were different .
i swear .
how many ?
i don' t know .
l ...
how many , peter ?
hundreds .
hundreds ?
yeah .
and there were some men as well .
men ?
yeah .
how many ?
i don' t know .
you don' t know ?
how many ?
i don' t remember .
it wasn' t many .
it was ... a few .
a few . " " a few . " what does that mean ?
not more than , i don' t know , 10 .
not more than 10 .
not more than 10 .
peter , that' s more than me .
it' s a disease , lou .
it' s taken me all my adult life to just ... accept that .
sammy helped me .
he helped me get there .
are you fucking my brother ?
i went to sammy because i saw the way he handled his addiction ... one day at a time .
i asked him if he could help me to get into a program .
he did , and that' s where i met farrah .
farrah .
what' s her addiction ?
is she a sex addict too ?
do the two of you just get together ... you just fuck all the time ?
it doesn' t matter .
it' s cocaine , actually .
oh .
good .
good ... expensive .
the worst thing of all , lou ... was that throughout our marriage ...
i blamed you for what was happening .
sure .
why not ?
the more i acted out , the less you seemed to notice .
you had this image of me that i was like some knight in shining armor .
you wouldn' t let go of it .
you clung to it .
i was desperate for you to catch me .
you have no idea what it' s like to live with an addiction ... day in , day out , lou ... to live this secret life .
but i can tell you right now ...
i have finished with hiding .
and if you' il let me , i ...
i want to repair the damage that i' ve done .
you' re on step nine , aren' t you ?
you' re making amends ?
i fucking hate step nine with a passion !
i am trying ... to repair the most important relationship ... of my life .
after all these years , i am offering myself to you .
the real me .
my real self .
get out , peter .
is this about me ?
no .
no .
it' s about peter .
who' s peter ?
he' s my ex husband .
oh , i didn' t ...
i didn' t know you were married .
i' m 39 years old .
we met yesterday .
look , i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
he just ... he told me some stuff about us .
about us ?
no , not us " us " ... but ... him and me " us .
when we were married .
like ... maybe he did some cheating ?
he probably fucked you at some point .
you know what , louise ?
this is about me .
i' ve entered your bloodstream .
you know ?
and he can smell it .
he' s jealous .
that' s all .
he wants you back .
you think ?
yeah , i think .
and , hey , you know , it' s not like i don' t know the feeling .
i' ve been thinking about you all day .
i have been counting the hours .
then i come over here , and you' re talking about him ?
i' m jealous !
you' re jealous ?
yeah !
l ... come on .
i want you all to myself .
you do ?
yes .
tonight it' s just you and me .
okay ?
it' s just you and me .
we are the only two people in the entire world .
oh , my god .
i had no idea i was this hungry .
so i went out and checked out some studio spaces .
you' re looking ?
yeah .
you know , if columbia doesn' t work out ...
i gotta have a plan b .
where are you working now ?
it' s this little place you might have heard of called my mom' s basement .
yeah .
well , what are you gonna do ?
scott , what would you do if you couldn' t paint ?
probably go crazy .
what if something happened ?
what if ... you were driving in your car ... and you hit a tree and you went flying through the windshield ?
i guess i would ... take all the splintered wood ... and the shattered glass and the twisted metal ... and i' d mix it with my blood and my guts ... and i' d create this giant ... mixed media roadkill sculpture .
but you' d be buried under the ground .
but i' d ... i' d bust out of there .
i' d come racing up through the dirt .
i' d bloom into a beautiful flower .
with any luck , someone would come by and take care of me ... give me plenty of water and sunlight .
sounds like a just add water kind of life .
no .
you know ... not if the person ... had a gentle touch .
not if they had a green thumb .
can we get dessert ?
break it up !
break it up !
hang on one sec .
this is ricky .
ricky , louise .
hi , louise .
hi .
are you aware that f .
scott here is not to be trusted ?
dude , just ... bounce .
who was that ?
that' s a friend ... from the old neighborhood .
and why are you not to be trusted ?
oh , that' s ' cause he' s being a dickhead .
i told my mom i was staying at his place last week , and i wasn' t .
he had to cover for me , so ... were you with a girl ?
well , that was before i met you , louise .
come with me .
i know what you' re thinking .
what am i thinking ?
you' re thinking that i' m too young for you .
how do you know what i' m thinking ?
well , i have powers , louise .
no , i do .
yeah .
you want me to prove it ?
no .
i think it would be fun .
come on .
look , you just met my best friend .
i want you to think of your best friend .
really get a picture of them in your mind .
okay ?
are you ... do you have that picture ?
okay .
i got it .
i really want you to concentrate .
i got it .
yeah ... whoa .
this is freaky .
let me see .
it' s strong tonight .
it' s a woman .
good .
yeah .
it' s a woman .
she' s got dark hair .
she lives in a house on a hill .
she' s got a child .
no .
two children .
twins !
twins .
her name starts with an m .
like m ... m ... missy ?
is it ... is her name missy ?
how do you know that ?
i told you , louise .
i know everything there is to know about you .
i' m just ... i' m kidding .
i spoke with missy yesterday on the phone .
you spoke with missy ?
yeah .
i came running out of the bathroom .
i was dripping wet .
i was , you know ...
i was hoping it' d be you .
she said she was your best friend .
is that true ?
it' s true .
what else did she say ?
she told me about ...
i don' t know .
she told me about marcos .
and the twins .
f. scott .
yeah ?
let' s go home .
yeah .
take off your clothes .
well , i like this .
walk back and forth .
walk ...
you' d leave a good lookin ' corpse .
well , that' s the best thing about dying young , right ?
you know what the worst thing is ?
about dying young ?
about dying when you' re still perfect .
i' m not perfect .
well , you' re a little scrawny .
wiry .
wiry .
thank you .
and , you know , this ... this is gonna go eventually .
that' s what i' m talking about .
the worst thing about dying young is that your work has no relevance .
why ?
' cause you got off easy .
you skipped out on all the countless humiliations life had planned for you .
so , then , as a career choice ... you would advise against dying young .
let' s play a game .
it' s a pretend game .
pretend ?
what shall we pretend ?
go to the mirror and look at your reflection .
oh , yeah .
now i' m gonna describe a situation to you .
you ready ?
yeah .
it' s the future .
you' re 40 years old .
can you imagine that ?
yeah .
you' re 40 years old ... and you' re a failure as an artist .
i mean , you haven' t completely stopped fighting .
you haven' t completely given up the ghost , but ... it' s been years and years , and your work hasn' t achieved any real acclaim .
i don' t care about acclaim , just as long as i get to keep working .
of course , which is why you haven' t quit .
but today you' re feeling particularly fragile .
this morning ... it' s morning , and you' re getting dressed for work .
where do i work ?
you work for your uncle selling cars ... in new jersey .
wow .
it' s a long commute .
you' re running late .
i' m a car salesman .
used cars .
wow .
and here' s where you have to use your imagination .
what you' re wearing .
look at yourself .
imagine that you' re wearing ... a dress shirt , boxers ... black socks and nothing else .
and you' re tying your tie .
i don' t know how to tie a tie .
exactly .
you never learned how .
that' s why you need me to help you .
and who are you , louise ?
you my wife ?
i am .
i' m your wife .
usually i tie your ties and hang them on the doorknob ... so all you have to do is slip them over your head , but i forgot today , so ... you need my help .
and here' s another thing you have to imagine .
you' ve gotten chubby over the years .
your hair has started to thin .
can you imagine that ?
yeah .
and today' s one of those days when you look in the mirror ... and you wonder if you have any fucking purpose at all in life .
you' re having a moment of serious doubt .
i' m scared .
you' re terrified .
you' re terrified .
and here i am .
i' m standing behind you , tying your tie .
you , a grown man in your boxers and black socks .
i' m standing here like your mother , and i look down at your stomach and ... you have love handles .
they' re oozing out over your boxers .
i reach down , grab them , give them a jiggle ... and i say , " darling ... why don' t you take up jogging ?
imagine me saying that to you ... just like that .
singsong , like a joke .
and what do i say ?
nothing .
you say nothing .
there' s nothing you can say .
you just have to stand there until i finish .
you just have to suck it up .
that' s pretty harsh .
you bet .
and guess what .
it' s just the tip of the iceberg .
but ... it' s that humiliation that will connect you to the rest of us .
it' s that feeling that will give your work meaning .
i know what this is about .
what ?
why you' re so angry .
i' m not angry .
it' s about peter .
he hurt you like crazy , louise .
i know it' s fresh ... but you have to listen to me .
he has nothing ...
look at me .
look at me .
f. scott ?
mom ?
what' s wrong , darling ?
everything .
peter has a girlfriend .
can you believe it ?
yes , i can .
so how did you find out ?
peter told me .
he told me a lot of things .
is she young ?
her name is farrah .
do you know why i love it out here ?
all i' m responsible for is this little piece of dirt .
no more saving the world .
no more fighting injustice .
just me and my babies .
is sammy coming for dinner ?
i never know when he' s coming .
he works such long hours .
but you baked a pie .
i keep a little something , just in case .
you know , you always complain that we never see each other ... but maybe if you baked me a pie , i' d be magically compelled to visit .
you don' t eat pie , darling .
twice in one week !
that' s a world record .
i need to know something .
what ?
how could you ?
how could i what ?
peter .
it' s his money , louise .
i don' t care about the money .
that' s not what i' m talking about .
okay .
so what are you talking about ?
you could have told me ... about peter , sammy .
he asked me not to , louise .
so , no , i could not have .
you couldn' t or wouldn' t ?
it' s not my job to tell you something you should have figured out for yourself .
how can you sit there with such dignity ?
you' re a drug addict .
i' m in recovery .
that' s right .
you just snap your fingers , everything goes back to normal ?
nothing is normal .
no , nothing is normal .
' cause you' re a grown man sitting in your mother' s kitchen eating pie .
your mother , who you stole from .
yeah , that' s right .
i' m here in her kitchen .
i' m here .
where have you been ?
in your office , watching your family fall apart ?
watching your husband flush his life down the toilet ?
where have you been ?
you don' t know anything about my marriage .
you know , asking the universe for pity ... is a waste of time .
the universe doesn' t care .
it doesn' t care that my entire life was a lie .
it doesn' t care that our mother' s getting older .
doesn' t care about you , me and the ... it sure as hell doesn' t care about your marriage .
then ... why don' t you help me out , sammy ?
why don' t you give me some of that good old step nine stuff ?
find the pattern .
" pattern . " find the pattern ... and put yourself in a position of profit when the pattern repeats itself .
you are so full of shit .
whatever , louise .
jesus .
dignity is a choice .
quit feeling sorry for yourself and work the problem .
is there a missy goldberg registered here ?
it' s open .
how did you find me ?
pattern recognition .
you sound like sammy .
sammy ?
didn' t i tell you ?
he' s helping me with some investments .
whatever it is , sink all your dough into it .
sink the kids ' college funds .
whatever he says , it' s a sure thing , truly .
i saw him .
who ?
sammy ?
you know who .
you were holding out on me .
what do you think , miss ?
i don' t think .
i know .
it' s him !
it' s scott .
you have a cigarette ?
i quit .
i can' t believe he' s real .
i thought i was going crazy .
believe me , it' s him .
the question is , what are we gonna do ?
you must have died when you first saw him .
i couldn' t believe my eyes .
but then again , i could .
it sort of made sense , having him there in my office .
how' d you find out , miss ?
coincidence .
fate .
you weren' t picking up in the office ... so i rang you at home and he picked up .
did you know right away ?
there was the voice .
but it was more than that .
it was the words he was using .
it was the way he was making me feel .
it felt like him , but i talked to him for half an hour before i finally asked him his name .
half an hour ?
i made him say it three times .
i actually made the poor kid spell it .
he must have thought i was crazy .
so , what was it ?
how did he make you feel ?
like myself .
the real me .
yes .
the one i' d forgotten about .
not the me that drives the kids to school in a fucking suv .
someone else .
the girl .
that' s it exactly .
i looked in the mirror , and for the first time in god knows how long ...
i saw someone i recognized .
it was me .
it was my face ... not the face of someone' s mother .
so i tried to get you to spill the beans ... which you wouldn' t do .
so i sat on my hands ... until i couldn' t fucking take it anymore ... and then i came here to see for myself .
and ...
and ...
i rang him up .
where ?
he was over at ricky' s .
ricky ?
how did you find out about ricky ?
scott' s mother' s in the phone book .
so i called her up , pretended like i was from columbia .
i said i needed to speak to him right away regarding his application .
then i rang him up ... and i invited him to brunch .
i said i' d tell him all about you .
so you were with him today .
yeah .
we had a blast .
i bought him socks .
did he ask about me ?
sure .
he was full of questions .
you didn' t tell him about scott , did you ?
excuse me .
i' m not an idiot .
and just how much progress did you make , missy ?
not enough .
but enough .
i touched him .
you touched him ?
you better believe it , sister .
i touched that creamy skin .
how could you hold out on me , wheezy ?
i loved him too , you know .
i understand that .
but who cares ?
what do you mean ?
we' re not sharing him this time !
we tried that .
remember ?
here' s what i remember .
i remember scott dumped you for me .
i remember it was me who shared .
it was me who took pity on you .
besides ... he was mine when he died .
i don' t care .
he was mine when he died !
so what ?
if he had lived , he would have come back to me .
he would have seen you for what you really are .
which is what ?
a dickhead !
maybe .
or maybe we would' ve gotten married ... had kids and lived in a loft in soho .
or maybe he' d be working at his uncle' s car dealership in new jersey .
right .
can you just see him doing that ?
you' re just jealous .
jealous of what ?
jealous that scott and i are married ...
living in soho with two beautiful kids and a jack russell terrier .
i' m not jealous .
he would' ve dumped you in three weeks for a sculptress with a toe ring .
and then what ?
he would' ve come running back to you ?
yes .
with me he could' ve had a family .
he could' ve had kids .
you needed in vitro !
he could' ve had that from me .
it just wasn' t in the cards with you , wheezy .
you are just not a mother .
i' m sorry , wheezy ... but it' s true .
besides , you' re forgetting how he used to treat you .
don' t you remember you told me ... he used to make you run around naked so he could poke fun at your body ?
he was critiquing me !
he was gonna paint my portrait !
which he kept promising to do , but he never did .
he did paint my portrait !
the mother and child !
wheezy !
you were 17 !
i' m telling him the truth .
i' m telling him everything .
you' re gonna fuck it up , louise !
f. scott , what are you doing out here ?
waiting for you .
did missy call you ?
what did she say ?
she said that you had something important to tell me .
let' s go inside .
why don' t you just tell me what you came here to tell me ?
what do you think i' m here to say ?
that you' re through with me .
that you' ve had your fun .
that' s not why i' m here .
when i was in high school ...
i had a boyfriend ... and i ... went out with him ... and then missy went out with him .
she stole him from me .
and then he was killed .
how ?
car accident .
louise , i' m sorry .
he looked like you .
he painted like you .
he had your name .
f. scott ?
scott feinstadt .
his name was scott feinstadt .
and missy thinks i' m a lot like this guy too ?
she does .
she thinks you' re him , or he' s you , or ... do you understand what i' m saying ?
well , what do you think , louise ?
what do i think ?
yeah .
you' re telling me that missy thinks i' m some guy back from the dead .
is that what you think ?
i don' t know !
yes .
yes .
you said you had something inside of you .
you said you were meant to be here in this place .
you said that .
and maybe you' re right .
maybe there is something inside of you .
maybe it brought you here to find me .
some guy broke your heart .
and i get that .
that' s traumatic .
but you know what ?
that happens to everybody .
no .
not like this .
that happens ... to everybody .
okay ?
it' s called high school .
and you know what ?
usually people learn from the experience ... and then they just move on with their lives .
maybe they shouldn' t .
maybe that' s what' s wrong with the world ... everybody , they' re just moving on .
when you' re working and nothing' s coming , do you just get up and walk away ?
do you ?
okay , i don' t want to fight , louise .
well , what if i want to ?
it takes two .
f. scott !
hello .
hi .
shit .
are you okay ?
i just wanted to tell you the truth , lou .
for once i wanted the words coming out of my mouth to bring us closer together .
hi .
listen .
let me guess .
peter .
yeah .
who are you ?
he' s an mfa applicant .
an mfa applicant ?
are you fucking insane ?
what' s going on here ?
she didn' t tell you about me ?
i' m the dead guy .
peter , i need you to leave .
no .
i think i' m gonna stay .
yeah , stick around .
we' il all grab hands and have a seance .
peter , please .
let me handle this .
yeah , you better let her handle this .
watch your tongue .
get the hell out of here !
stop !
peter .
please .
i' il call you in 15 minutes .
okay ?
fine .
it was a pleasure .
i don' t believe you .
you come over last night and you fuck with my head ... and the whole time you have been sleeping with your ex husband ?
peter and i did not sleep together last night .
we didn' t sleep together much when we were married .
then what ?
is that how you break up with someone ?
tell them they' re dead and just hope they' il go away ?
the whole thing is just too fucking mystical for me .
you don' t think this is mystical for me too ?
i wake up yesterday morning ... and you' re asleep next to me ... and i' m freaking out ' cause everything' s so new and different .
and then i look over at you ... and i am blinded ... i' m blinded .
you are six inches from my face ... and you are so fucking beautiful i can' t even focus my eyes .
what ?
my name' s not f .
scott .
okay ?
it' s francis .
francis ?
francis scott key feinstadt .
i guess i thought f .
scott sounded cool on the application .
everyone at home calls me fran .
fran ?
yeah .
fran .
you know what the worst part is ?
you don' t even think i' m an artist in my own right , do you ?
i' m just some extension of him .
right ?
you know what that is , louise ?
the mother and child ?
it' s a fuckin ' joke .
don' t say that .
that' s some kid who kicked over a can of paint ... and decided to call it art .
don' t say that !
i couldn' t sleep last night .
you know , i was going crazy ... trying to make some sense of what you said .
so you know what i did ?
what ?
i went and saw missy .
and what happened ?
what do you think happened ?
bye .
have you seen him ?
yes .
we acted like a couple of boys , didn' t we ?
what happened last night ?
the kid came up to my room .
we fucked till the sun came up .
we did it four , maybe five times .
we did everything imaginable .
the earth moved .
is that what you wanna hear ?
i wanna hear the truth .
the truth is , i gave him a shot .
i gave him two shots , actually .
he wasn' t buying .
he said no .
can you believe it ?
why , miss ?
why ?
you know how it is .
i only wanted him because you had him .
is that really true ?
of course it is .
at least that' s what marcos says , anyway .
you told marcos ?
we' re meeting this weekend in napa .
you said terrible , terrible things to me last night .
you said some pretty terrible things to me too .
you said terrible things to me .
i surrender .
you won .
it' s not attractive to sit around and gloat .
gloat ?
what are you talking about ?
gloat ?
wheezy , would you stop !
no two snowflakes are exactly alike ... but these two are pretty damn close .
you have a gorgeous snowflake ... who' s just dying to get to know you better .
what are you doing ?
you' re sitting here arguing with me .
i swear .
some people just refuse ... to let anything good happen to them .
this is sammy .
this is louise .
what' s wrong ?
there' s nothing wrong .
gotta call you back then .
okay ?
i am really proud of you , you know .
all right .
eat my butt .
i got your message .
i know you were worried .
yeah .
i was gonna call the police .
i told you i could handle it .
so you did .
you and i are never gonna work , peter .
even though ... we love each other ?
even though we love each other .
fran .
hey , louise .
louise , look ... what is this , like ... some kind of dear john letter ?
did you do this ?
no .
your work did that .
congratulations .
and your work is beautiful .
fran , it' s beautiful .
louise , thank you .
so ... so .
it' s a beautiful day , so ... yeah , it is .
i guess i' il see you later .
i know where to find you .
