i know you
i waked with you once upon a dream
i know you
the gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
yet i know it' s true
that visions are seldom all they seem
but if i know you
i know what you' il do
you' il love me at once
the way you did once upon a dream
in a far away land long ago lived a king ...
and his fair queen .
many years had they longed for a child ...
and finally their wish was granted .
a daughter was born , and they called her aurora .
sweet aurora
' yes , they named her after the dawn ...
' for she filled their lives with sunshine .
then a great holiday was proclaimed ...
' throughout the kingdom ...
so that all of high or low estate ...
might pay homage to the infant princess .
and our story begins on that most joyful day .
on that joyful day
on that joyful day
joyfully now to our princess we come
bringing gifts and all good wishes
to replete our loyalty anew
hail to the princess aurora
aii of her subjects adore her
hail to the king
hail to the queen
hail to the princess aurora
health to the princess , wealth to the princess
long live the princess aurora
hail aurora
hail aurora
health to the princess , wealth to the princess
long live the princess aurora
hail to the king
hail to the queen
hail to the princess aurora
thus , on this great and joyous day ...
did all the kingdom celebrate the awaited awaited royal birth ...
and good king stefan and his queen made welcome ...
' their lifelong friend .
their royal highnesses ...
king hubert and prince philip !
fondly had these monarchs dreamed one day ...
' their kingdoms to unite ...
' thus , today would they announce ...
' that philip , hubert' s son and heir ...
' to stefan' s child would be betrothed .
and so , to her his gift he brought ...
and looked , unknowing , on his future bride .
their most honored and exalted excellencies ... the three good fairies ...
mistress flora ...
mistress fauna ... and mistress merryweather !
ahh .
oh .
the little darling .
your majesties .
each of us the child may bless ... with a single gift ... no more , no less .
little princess , my gift shall be ... the gift of beauty .
one gift
beauty rare
gold of sunshine in her hair
lips that shame the red , red rose
she' il walk with springtime wherever she goes
tiny princess ... my gift shall be the gift of song .
one gift
the gift of song
melody her whole life long
the nightingales her tune adore
bringing his sweet serenade to her door
sweet princess , my gift shall be the ...
wind howls ]
why , it' s maleficent .
what does she want here ?
shhh .
well ...
quite a glittering assemblage , king stefan .
royalty , nobility , the gentry , and ah ha ha ha ha how quaint .
even the rabble .
ooooh .
i really felt quite distressed ... at not receiving an invitation .
you weren' t wanted .
not wa ah ha .
oh , dear , what an awkward situation .
i had hoped it was merely due ... to some oversight .
well , in that event , i' d best be on my way .
and ... you' re not offended , your excellency ?
why , no , your majesty ... and to show i bear no ill will ...
i , too , shall bestow a gift on the child .
listen well , all of you .
the princess shall indeed grow in grace and beauty ... beloved by all who know her .
but ... before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday ... she shall prick her finger ... on the spindle of a spinning wheel ... and die !
oh , no !
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha .
seize that creature !
stand back , you fools !
don' t despair , your majesties .
merryweather still has her gift to give .
then she can undo this fearful curse ?
oh , no , sire .
maleficent' s powers are far too great .
but she can help .
but ...
just do your best , dear .
yes , go on .
sweet princess ...
if through this wicked witch' s trick ... a spindle should your finger prick ... a ray of hope there still may be in this ... the gift i give to thee .
not in death , but just in sleep ... this fateful prophecy you' il keep ... and from this slumber you shall wake ... when true love' s kiss the spell shall break .
for true love conquers all
but king stefan ...
still fearful of his daughter' s life ...
did then and there decree ...
' that every spinning wheel in the kingdom ...
should on that very day be burned .
so ' rwas done .
oh , silly ...
now , come have a nice cup of tea , dear .
i' m sure it will work out somehow .
well , a bonfire won' t stop maleficent .
of course not , but what will ?
perhaps if we reason with her ...
reason ?
with maleficent ?
well , she can' t be all bad .
oh , yes , she can .
oooh .
i' d like to turn her into a fat , old hop toad .
now , dear , that isn' t a very nice thing to say .
besides , we can' t .
you know our magic doesn' t work that way . it can only do good , dear ... to bring joy and happiness .
well , that would make me happy .
but there must be some way .
but there must be some way .
there is !
there is ?
what is it , flora ?
i' m going to ...
shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh .
follow me .
i' il turn her into a flower .
maleficent ?
no , no , dear , the princess .
oh , she' d make a lovely flower .
don' t you see ?
a flower can' t prick its finger . it hasn' t any .
that' s right .
she' il be perfectly safe .
until maleficent sends a frost .
yes .
er ...
oh , dear .
she always ruins your nicest flowers .
you' re right ... and she' il be expecting us to do something like that .
oooh .
well , what won' t she expect ?
she knows everything .
oh , but she doesn' t , dear .
maleficent doesn' t know anything about love ... or kindness or the joy of helping others .
you know , sometimes i don' t think ... she' s really very happy .
that' s it .
of course .
it' s the only thing she can' t understand ... and won' t expect .
oh !
now , now , now ... we have to plan it carefully .
let' s see , the woodcutter' s cottage .
yes , yes , yes , the abandoned one .
of course , the king and queen will object ... but when we explain it' s the only way
explain what ?
about the three peasant women raising a foundling child ... deep in the forest .
oh ?
well , that' s very nice of them .
who are they ?
turn around .
why , it' s us !
uh huh .
you mean we us ?
uh huh .
take care of the baby ?
why not ?
oh , i' d like that !
well , y yes , but we' d have to feed it
and wash it and dress it and rock it to sleep .
oh , i' d love it .
you really think we can ?
lf humans can do it , so can we .
and we' d have our magic to help us .
that' s right .
no , no , no , no , no , no !
no magic .
i' il take those wands right now .
oh , better get rid of those wings , too .
you mean live like mortals ?
for sixteen years ?
uh huh .
but now now we don' t know how .
we' ve never done anything without magic .
and that' s why maleficent will never suspect .
but who' il wash and cook ?
oh , we' il all pitch in .
i' il take care of the baby .
let me have it , dear .
come along , now .
we must tell their majesties at once .
flora .
flora .
so the king and his queen watched ...
' with heavy hearts ...
as their most precious possession , their only child ...
disappeared into the night .
many sad and lonely years passed by ...
' for king stefan and his people .
but as the time for the princess' s ...
sixteenth birthday drew near ...
' the entire kingdom began to rejoice ...
' for everyone knew ...
' that as long as maleficent' s domain ...
' the forbidden mountains ...
' thundered with her wrath and frustration ...
her evil prophecy had not yet been fulfilled .
it' s incredible !
sixteen years , and not a trace of her !
she couldn' t have vanished into thin air !
are you sure you searched everywhere ?
yeah , yeah , uh ...
everywhere we all did .
yeah !
yeah !
and what about the town ?
the forest ?
the mountains ?
uh , we check mountains ... uh uh , forest ...
uh , houses and , uh , let me see , uh ... and all the cradles .
cradles ?
uh , yep , yep .
ha ha ha ha .
every cradle .
cradle ? !
did you hear that , my pet ?
all these years ... they' ve been looking for a baby .
oh , ha ha ha !
fools !
idiots !
imbeciles !
aaah !
aaah !
ooh !
ooh !
ouch !
ouch !
ahhh .
oh , they' re hopeless ... a disgrace to the forces of evil .
oh , my pet .
you are my last hope .
circle far and wide .
search for a maid of sixteen , with hair of sunshine gold ... and lips red as the rose .
go , and do not fail me .
and so , for sixteen long years ...
' the whereabouts of the princess ...
remained a mystery ...
' while deep in the forest in a woodcutter' s cottage ...
' the good fairies carried out their well laid plan .
living like mortals ...
' they had reared the child as their own ...
and called her briar rose .
on this , her sixteenth birthday ...
' the good fairies had planned a party ...
and something extra special for a surprise .
well , now , how about this one ?
this is the one i picked .
ooh , she' il look beautiful in that .
now , i thought a few changes here .
uh huh .
don' t forget a pretty bow .
yes , and raise the shoulder line .
we' il make it blue .
oh , no , dear , pink .
of course , we' il need a few pleats .
yes , but how are we going to get her ... out of the house ?
i' ii think of something .
well .
and what are you three dears up to ?
up to ?
up to ?
up to ?
er , er ...
we we want you to pick some berries .
that' s it berries .
berries ?
lots of berries .
but i picked berries yesterday .
oh , we need more , dear .
lots , lots more .
yes .
now , don' t hurry back , dear .
but don' t go too far .
and don' t speak to strangers .
good bye , dear .
good bye !
good bye !
i wonder if she suspected .
of course not .
come on .
oh , will she be surprised .
a real birthday party ... with a real birthday cake .
yes , and a dress a princess can be proud of .
i' il get the wands .
yes , you g the wands ?
oh , no !
no magic .
but the sixteen years are almost over .
we' re taking no chances .
but i' ve never baked a fancy cake .
oh , you won' t have to , dear .
i' m going to bake the cake .
you ?
oh , she' s always wanted to , dear ... and this is her last chance .
well ...
i' m going to make it fifteen layers ... with pink and blue forget me nots .
and i' m making the dress .
but you can' t sew , and she' s never cooked .
oh , ho , ho , it' s simple .
all you do is follow the book .
up here , dear .
you can be the dummy .
well , i still say we ought to use magic .

that' s for the feet to go through .
it' s pink .

but i wanted it blue .
now , dear ... we decided pink was her color .

hmm .
oh , gracious !
how that child has grown !
oh , it seems only yesterday we brought her here .
just a tiny baby .
why , merryweather !
whatever is the matter , dear ?
after today , she' il be a princess ... and we won' t have any briar rose .
oh , flora !
now , now , now , now .
w we we all knew this day had to come .
but why did it have to come so soon ?
after all ... we' ve had her for sixteen years .
sixteen wonderful years .
good gracious !
we' re acting like a lot of ninnies !
come on !
she' il be back before we get started .
do you hear that , samson ?

come on .
let' s find out .

and a few ... carrots ?
hup , boy !

i wonder why each little bird
has a someone
to sing to
sweet things to
a gay , little lark melody
i wonder
i wonder
if my heart keeps singing
will my song go winging
to someone
who' il find me
and bring back a love song to me
oh , dear .
why do they still treat me like a child ?
whoo !
aunt flora , aunt fauna ...

oh , we walk together and talk together ... and just before we say good bye ... he takes me in his arms ...
and then ...
i wake up .
yes , it' s only in my dreams .
but they say if you dream a thing more than once ... it' s sure to come true .
and i' ve seen him so many times .
you know , samson ... there' s something strange about that voice .
too beautiful to be real .
maybe it was some mysterious being ... a ... a wood sprite or a ...
here !

why , it' s my dream prince !
your highness .
you know , i' m really not supposed ... to speak to strangers ... but we' ve met before .

oh , i improved it .
but perhaps if i added a few more ruffles ... uh , what do you think ?
um ... l think so .

rose !
prince phillip !
oh !
oh !

we' ve got to get back to the cottage .
whistling once upon a dream ]
come in !
well ... this is a pleasant surprise .
i set my trap for a peasant , and lo ,
i catch a prince !
away with him .
but gently , my pets ... gently .
i have plans for our royal guest .
maleficent !
she' s got prince phillip !
at the forbidden mountain .
but we can' t !
we can' t go there !
we can , and we must !
what a pity prince phillip ... can' t be here to enjoy the celebration .
come .
we must go to the dungeon and cheer him up .
oh , come now , prince phillip .
why so melancholy ?
a wondrous future lies before you .
you , the destined hero ... of a charming fairy tale come true .
behold ...
king stefan' s castle ...
and in yonder topmost tower ...
dreaming of her true love ... the princess aurora .
but see the gracious whim of fate .
why , ' tis the selfsame peasant maid ... who won the heart of our noble prince ... but yesterday .
she is indeed most wondrous fair .
gold of sunshine in her hair .
lips that shame the red , red rose .
in ageless sleep ... she finds repose .
the years roll by ... but a hundred years to a steadfast heart ... are but a day .
and now the gates of a dungeon part ... and our prince is free to go his way .
off he rides on his noble steed ... a valiant figure ... straight and tall ... to wake his love ... with love' s first kiss ... and prove that true love conquers all .
why , you you ...
come , my pet .
let us leave our noble prince ... with these happy thoughts .
a most gratifying day .
for the first time in sixteen years ...
i shall sleep well .
shh !
no time to explain .
wait , prince phillip .
the road to true love may be barred ... by still many more dangers ... which you alone will have to face .
so arm thyself ... with this enchanted shield of virtue ... and this mighty sword of truth .
for these weapons of righteousness ... will triumph over evil .
now , come .
we must hurry .
whinnies ]
phillip , watch out !
silence !
you , tell those fools to ...
no !
no !
watch out , phillip !
hurry !
hurry , phillip !
a forest of thorns shall be his tomb .
a forest of thorns shall be his tomb .
born through the skies on a fog of doom .
now go with the curse and serve me well ...
round stefan' s castle ...
cast my spell !
whinnies ]
whinnies ]
no , it cannot be !
now shall you deal with me , o prince ... and all the powers of hell !
whinnies ]

oh , oh , uh , forgive me , hubert .
the wine .

i know you
the gleam in your eyes

you' il love me at once
the way you did once
upon
a
dream
