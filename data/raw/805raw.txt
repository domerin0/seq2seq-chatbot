i' m supposed to interview you , and then write a report for school .

so spider man that' s what i always wanted to be .
dad , this is supposed to be serious .
i really don' t know what to say .
i have a really great job .
but to be honest , it' s not the job i' ve always dreamt about having .
i thought you wanted to be a writer .
you' re the writer , okay ?
i' ve read your play ten times .
it' s amazing !
how come you only wrote one ?
writing was a dream i had when i was a kid .
and then i grew up .

i' d just appreciate it if you' d park someplace else .
you know what i think , um

he' s going through a divorce .
it' s really sad .
he kept telling me how great
any work related problems prior to the incident ?
he was promised a promotion almost a year ago , and never happened .
so , basically , he' s a schmuck .
the guy' s a devoted father , a hard worker with nothing but positive reviews .

his wife left him .
he was passed over for a promotion ... and he just got bitch slapped in the company parking lot .

well , " we " have left him several messages .
i' m waiting to hear back

the efficiency nazis are all over us .
employees fighting in the parking lot sort of undercuts ... the company wellness program , if you know what i mean .
do you think i' m not doing my job ?
it doesn' t matter what i think .
but what if he decides to sue ?
what if he sues the living daylights ... out of the company for failure to create a safe work environment , or , uh , uh , emotional distress ?

um , joe .
we' d really like for you to come back to work .

good morning .
boy , that is a great color on you .
director of internal communications ?
oh , well .
what the hell is that ?
that position doesn' t even exist .
presidential compliance .
what is that ?
uh , read your manual .
meg , if joe scheffer stays home ... and pours bourbon on his cereal , he can sue us for negligence , but if he comes back to work , we make him happy .
a reasonable period of time passes , we' re free and clear .
he can' t sue .
that is presidential compliance .
and what happens after that reasonable period ?
what happens to his job , to him ?
i don' t know !
who cares ?
i do .
i' m afraid i' m going to have to let you go .
mr. scheffer ?
hmm ?
yes ?
i' m deidre , your executive assistant .
i have an executive assistant ?
yes . and her name is deidre .
right .
would you like to see your office ?
i' ve been looking at it .
this isn' t it .
you have a thing for the a v guy ?
no .
no , i don' t .
yeah .
no .
see , ' cause i always thought , uh , you know , you and i , we
do you think that we should be discussing
discussing ?
this ?
here .
you' re right .
you' re absolutely right .
let' s stop wasting time .
tonight , let' s go to grumpy' s .
get some margaritas , maybe some ribs , have some fun .
what do you say ?
jeremy , that' s never gonna happen .
oh .
that' s fine .
jeremy , look .
no , i get it , about about joe .
you don' t care about him , but you care about him .
it' s your job .
you' re the wellness coordinator .
you care about his wellness .
actually , there' s  stop for a second , meg .
you remember why your little wellness program even exists ?
i am here to help
to keep corporate objectives .
that' s the only reason you' re here .
you' re here to make people believe we care .
i' m a propagandist ?
yeah .
you' re a propagandist .
presidential compliance , meg .
you tell anyone about our conversation , and you can start sending out your resume .
we were never under review , were we ?
oh , yeah !
we' re under review , meg .
we' re all under review all the time .
and that includes , uh , your boyfriend , scheffer .
what the hell is that supposed to mean ?
you' il see .
wow !
oh , it' s too much .
you' ve come a long way , haven' t you , joe ?
just look at this .
this is great .
just when you get to think that no one appreciates your work ,
that nobody  great , so here' s the deal .
mckinney' s due back next week , so your big day is almost here .
a small problem , though .
what' s the small problem ?
the company is posting security guards in the parking lot for the foreseeable future ... so that fight is not gonna happen here , joe .
but it has to .
i know .
this is your 15 minutes of fame .
what do you mean , 15 minutes ?
it' s a cliche .
maybe you' il get 20 .
i don' t know .
oh .
what if
what if what if
what if somebody
what if ah , here .
thank you .
what if somebody could change the venue ?
what if the fight actually happened in a schoolyard ?
how cool would that be ?
could you do that ?
no , i couldn' t , uh , officially ... do anything .
well , why would you , not officially , do this ?
because i know how you feel , joe .
i was nobody too .
guys like mckinney used me to limber up for real fights .
if i had a shot at a guy like that now , i would
i envy you , joe .
i really do .
frank .
go long , buddy , go long .
thanks , joe .

now that there' s a problem with you , i wanna be here for you .
i wanted to be a guidance counselor .
okay .
i wanted to help girls like me .
girls who were too busy cleaning the house or paying bills ... to do homework or join the pep squad .
but i thought i should make a little money first , right ?
you know , put something aside .
before i knew it , i was waking up in a better apartment .
i was going on vacation to places like saint barts ,

she quit ?
yeah , she was coming unglued .
everything was a drama .

i need more bleach .
i need more bleach .

that' s what jeremy said .
he also said that ... you slept with him .
oh !
does that bother you ?
yeah .
never happened .
if jeremy chained me to a bed ,
i' d set myself on fire .
why' d you quit ?
um , well , i am the new assistant guidance counselor ... at pembroke high school .
i know .
it' s kind of a huge cut in pay .
i think i may have to give them money , actually , but
this is wonderful .
you' re great with kids .
and you' il have an opportunity to show them that victory dance .
yeah , okay .
thanks , joe .
joe you can' t fight .
it' s not right .
if you lay a finger on mckinney ... in that parking lot , they can fire you .
jeremy moved the fight .
we' re not fighting in the parking lot .
he wants to see you get your ass kicked .
nobody' s gonna get their ass kicked .
let it go .
and no one is gonna get fired .
everybody loves me over there .
uh huh .
then where were they before ?
if i back out , i will never know who i am .
you are the guy that admitted to me that your ex wife put a hole in you ... so big that it still burns when the wind blows through .
the guy who kept helping me even after he had stapled his sleeve ...
the guy who kept helping me even after he had stapled his sleeve ... to a " choose happiness " banner .
you mean the guy that got his ass kicked in the parking lot ?
no , no .
i mean the guy that kept getting up every morning , being a father to his daughter that' s the guy that you are .
i was nobody .
you have no idea what i' d be giving up if i don' t fight .
i know what you would be giving up if you do .
i' m sorry , meg .
i have to fight .
yeah ?
because you' re afraid not to .
okay , okay , okay !
you ... are winded !
you take five !
you' re killing yourself .
water ?
is there a beer in there ?
how come you got out of doing movies ?
i guess i kind of turned into an unbearable shit .
aren' t there a lot of people like that in this business ?
yeah .
but it helps if you' ve got something that nobody can live without .
you know something funny ?
when my first picture became a hit , there were a whole lot of people just lined up waiting to kiss my ass .
then when the movies started to tank , well you know , they lined up behind somebody else' s ass .
well
you gotta have people in your life who are there for you .
whether you' re somebody or not .

nope .
