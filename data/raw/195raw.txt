today is my birthday
and for the first time in twenty years , i' m not alone
i met someone .
a man ...
a killer .
and soon , he will kill me .
it was holidays
a travel to san francisco to paint and take rest
i had to come back to vancouver this morning
but i changed my mind
this decision sealed my destiny .
listen to me !
no matter what they paid you ,
i can give you more !
all i have !
for the love of god !
spare me !
my name ... is yo .
my parents died 20 years ago ,
i' m alone since .
i paint what i fear to desire .
they call him freeman
and now ...
he' s coming to free me
open your bag
what is it ?
clay .
you travel with clay ?
i am potter .
the clay is essential .
a good potter uses his own clay .
so i need good ground
i dry it , cut it into pieces and filter it .
the goal is to increase its colloidal quality , to obtain a good plasticity and a strong refraction .
some store it during 20 years .
miss ...
do you want to keep me here during 20 years .
any problem ?
not any .
always change weapon for each execution
what a waste ...
can i come back ?
where ?
shoot
i want to come back home
you haven' t any home
shoot .
the dragons appreciated your work in san francisco .
the son is dead , but his father is an old lion
he always dreams about conquest
shimazaki can bite again .
he' s here in vancouver .
exactly there where we wanted him to be
are you looking for me , boss ?
lnspector netah , inspector forge .
netah is from interpol .
he' s your new boss .
we will see that at the meeting , see you .
thanks .
let me introduce you mister shimazaki from hakushin .
mr shimazaki is here as a japanese citizen to avoid an useless bloodbath .
the inspector netah from tokyo is here as
cultural connection " .
we can thanks to him talk directly with mr. shimazaki .
my name is shimazaki .
head of 26 000 men and hakushin organization .
last 4 august , in san francisco , my son has been killed
an unworthy death , given by an assassin .
a woman living there has been the witness of the murder
her name is emu o' hara .
the assassin will come to kill her , let him do it .
either we accept or he let his men do a bloodshed .
he wants us to close eyes .
stay quiet .
bring me there emu o' hara !
now .
we are confronted with a delicate situation .
stay quiet .
my son' s murderer is here ,
in your town , he comes to kill this woman
cause she sees his face .
he follows his code .
his code ?
what kind of killer is he ?
he belongs to an old warlike sect , an ancient chinese order . called the sons of dragon .
he is their killer .
a powerful lone man .
they don' t need anybody else .
oh god !
it' s like a goddamn video game .
are we playing dungeons and dragons ?
the yakusa killers from mars .
my children like it !
stop that !
mr shimazaki doesn' t joke .
the origins of son of the dragon are very ancient .
1400 years ago , the mandchous took the throne of china and established a reign of terror .
hundred eight buddhist monks revolted .
mandchous killed them all except five .
they founded the sons of the dragon .
their goal : protect chinese people , fight against the injustice and oppression .
they have a killer : the freeman .
the legend tells that the breath of the dragon is inside him , that he is immortal .
he can be chinese , american , japanese , any color , any race ,
but he' s still the dragon , the same man ... the perfect killer .
where is the truth ?
where is the legend ?
who can say ?
sons of dragon are true , like the freeman
they are fanatics !
criminals !
i give you 48 hours to catch him !
after that ...
you are warned .
stay here .
go away !
beware !
yo ...
yakusas will think twice before to come back to china .
both boss are dead .
we are avenged .
all returned in good order .
do it fastly ...
i dont know , i can' t help you .
all was ...
... so fast , i know .
she seems to know anything .
what can we find in her deposition from san francisco ?
nothing tells that she knows yo .
but she said his name while seing him today .
can she hide an information to the police ?
if it is the case , it is an important infraction .
yo " .
it is a japanese name .
is he japanese ?
ok , you can go , however ... you have to understand , miss o' hara , that this " yo " will be less nice than me
you should better tell me or you will pass away .
miss o' hara , a moment please
we have an ultimatum .
yakusas want to be avenged .
they want him , and in 48 hours , there will be a war .
the city will become a battle field .
people will die .
sorry inspector .
i want to go back home .
do you know , miss o' hara , that in china , when a killer told you his name , it means that he will take your life .
wait .
we will take you back home .
you need an official mandate for you to enter at home .
some people don' t need a mandate , just an invitation .
without disturb you , we want to check the security .
take this .
it is a transmitter .
if needed , press on the button and we will be there in the 20 seconds .
take it , it could help .
forge told me that the police would stay in the park all night .
i didn' t want them in the house .
my parents died here .
and the cops were there too during that night .
sorry , inspector forge .
you can' t help me and i can' t help you .
good night .
forge knew all about my father , the judge , and his crusade against mafia .
but did she know how i was guilty of his death ?
mr yo
it' s really late to have a walk ...
i' m working at night .
there are two kinds of peope working at night
really ?
i would never believed that from you .
you should go back home .
it' s dangerous tonight .
you could have troubles .
thanks for the advice .
i will listen to you .
forge ?
can you read me ?

i always believed that death will be cold ... and awful .
not like you .
please ...
i wanted you to be back .
wake up .
wake ...
it' s been so long .
ryuji ...
you are lucky .
it' s only me .
you would not have dared to kill my colleague ?
i wouldn' t send you to jail .
we don' t kill the cops .
except if they belong to us ,
like you my friend .
talk !
i don' t like to press myself , nor to wait .
we want the girl !
impossible , we have a deal .
you should wait for 48 hours , don' t make simazaki lie .
i don' t care about your deal why ?
you would not like to be the boss ?
exactly , netah .
i would be the boss , if i bring back the freeman .
the death of the shimazaki' s son ...
you are not a stranger in this affair .
how did they find him ?
netah ...
you are here thanks to us .
don' t forget that !
you should look in another direction .
a little serum and she will sing like in an opera .
you forget something blade , it' s not japan here .

she' s lovely ...
i will like to question it .
you are the freeman .
reply me !
the weapon you hold is for her .

i will hide the incident to the family .

hinomura . it' s enough !

hinomura ...
i' m so cold .
three days later , i wake up at hospital .
my father died there before i can ask him for forgiveness .
this night , i was outside , playing .
i disconnected alarm and left the open door .
the killer of my father entered the door .
mery brought me there to see my father .
and she comes to see me now .
the cycle was closed .
mery .
my god , emu ...
speak lower , i don' t want you to hear us .
i need your help .

o. k. , boss , please .
i thought that visits were prohibited .
visit , no .
interrogations , yes .
let her quiet , netah , she almost died .
this flowers need water , where are the toilets ?
just there .
she wanted him to kill her .
you didn' t understand that , no ?
that he killed her , sure .
inspector netah , a call in the office of the nurses .
netah speaking .
who' s there ?
nothing special ?
god !
where do she go ?
i don' t know .
be ready .
cops are after you .
since when did you deal with shimazaki ?
it' s too big for you , forge .

no , you enjoy the ride cause it' s the last one .
take my hand .
i send the girl to the airport , as envisaged .
i believed that somebody had kidnapped me .
it' s like i was
yo sent this guy take me .
remember : hinomura .
i gave up all behind me .

i didn' t know .

send this message to your guardians , the dragons !
i , hanada ryuji , boss of hanadas ,
i declare the war with the dragons
i want the freeman , otherwise ...
i will be back in china ... and will kill again !
i travelled 3 days long , among people that i didn' t understand .
i spoke to nobody .
and during all this time i felt eyes posed on me .
somebody observed me .
i wasn' t safe .
the girl took his heart .
he used us to make her escape .
she' s more important for him than our laws .
he disobeyed for her .
and the boss of yakusas ?
ryuji hanada ?
he killed 16 of our men .
in a factory of soya with shanghai .
he challendes us .
he wants the freeman .
it' s good that you speak to us .
our freeman loves somebody else .
we are jealous .
we want revenge .
say freeman to kill
ryuji hanada .
and you will kill after that the freeman !
my father was a famous japanese potter .
he learned you ?
he learned me to watch .
look this place ...
it gives it its shape .
and there , where there are shadows ... darkness ... ... is as useful as light .
i' m not an artist anymore .
my name , my job , all is only a cover .
who could guess than the killer of sons of the dragon is only a simple potter ?
7 years ago , during my first exposure .
criticisms were very good .
it was my little glory .
and i enjoyed each minute of it .
all can change so fast .
so fast , as if past was a dream .
i came back .
a part of me didn' t want to see .
but the other one wanted to see beyond .
i didn' t know anything about that guy , but he had looked at me
the look of a dead is a curse for who cross it .
i wanted to see in darkness .
i wanted to know them .
what did i find ?
the picture showed the two killers from the exposure .
they tortured somebody . whose body wore an impressive tatoo .
i didn' t know what it would mean for me .
i decided to go and send the film to the police .
kill .
kill .
you will kill at our command .
i was back at my hotel .
my neck was painful .
what happened to me ?
why did they kidnapped me ?
i wanted to go back home as soon as possible .
kill .
you will kill at our command .
open your bag ... now .
his name is antonio rossi .
antonio rossi can feel a gun .
you will kill him with a knife .
you will kill him with a knife .
eh , where are you going ?
these flowers are for the woman .
as you want , but don' t come back without his fingers in a bag .
mr rossi !
flowers , for kari .
carlo , please .
who send you flowers ?
you could send me flowers too .
the ring your have is not enough ?
these is your false tits that i will return to the surgeon !
who send these flowers ?
the dragons .
we did not expect that you survive , but you are walking with the dragon .
you have the gift
the gift of the death bearer .
the crying killer .
your tears honour you , dragon .
you just meet your destiny .
the witch had visited me in the night .
she wrote her mark on my body .
impossible to erase it .
the sign of dragon for all life .
the dragon took you . your spirit , your body .
freeman , you have been spellbound by its picture .
it is the picture of your soul that is thirsty for freedom .
but there is no freedom on earth .
the true freedom is in spirit , in the sky to where the dragon flies you will follow him , what makes you live .
i' m koh .
your guide .
you obey the sons of dragon , guardian of chinese people .
those which offend our race must die .
you will follow our orders , as our laws , our rules , our requirements .
you belong to us .
you are born killer .
this power is yours .
i will improve it .
you will become stronger , faster , more fatal .
our enemies will feel the claws of the dragon to bore their hearts .
come now .
you are born again .
you are ... the freeman .
and tears ?
i don' t know .
each freeman has his curse .
they are maybe mine .
you don' t understand ?
koh ordered to you to kill me .
you didn' t do it
you disobeyed to them and you won .
it' s so peaceful here .
yes , koh ?
we were attacked .
the dragon is furious .
ryuji hanada is challenging us .
look at that .
it' s a trap .
they want his head .
the one who will kill freeman will be the boss .
be ready , we have to go .
now .
no , you can' t go .
he' s the man of the sons of the dragon .
he must follow me .
16 men are dead .
they got children and families .
ryuji will kill again till we don' t fight him .
ryuji know who is freeman .
everyone that knows the freeman must be killed .
it' s the rule .
we are going to tokyo , ryuji will attend funerals of shimazaki .
shlmazaki house near tokyo
dogaki wish to talk to you , boss .
dogaki ?
where is he ?
ryuji speaking ?
i got a problem .
i can' t come .
i will send you two men .
they will honor the memory of shimazaki .
you could keep them .
they are good men .
you are generous but i can' t accept .
please ryuji , it' s a gift .
you are the new boss .
i' m not yet the head of hakushin , mr dogaki . good , accept my gift .
thanks .
no .
she knows the rules .
you become weak , freeman .
i was a friend of shimazaki .
to be the new boss will please me .
the old dogaki sends me a gift , two men .
you should knock the door .
i would prefer hit you .
you are going too far .
someone must pay for the bloodshed .
well find someone , it' s your job
but you are my suspect number one .
and my job is to follow everywhere
so blade , what is the dinner tonight ?
rather hypocritical , that ...
after all , you send his son to san francisco , and many people will be happy to learn that information .
kimie .
my wife .
can you introduce me your friend ?
let me introduce you to my wife .
here is netah ... ... the cop .
we already know us .
why are you here , mr netah ?
a problem ?
cop affair and personnal affair .
netah would like to take the freeman first .
but why wait for him ?
a hunted animal is more dangerous , whereas at his home , he sleeps peacefully .
tell me .
we had the list of the passengers having left vancouver , the day when emu o ' hara fled the hospital .
she did not take any plane .
miss o' hara , not any .
but ... a young woman took a fly to tokyo , alone .
without luggage .
with a false passport .
miss o' hara is in japan , netah .
his picture circulates in all japan .
everybody are looking for her .
she is with the freeman .
she is his wife .
remember what i said ryuji .
madam , i hope that we will meet us again .
yes , mr netah .
japan is a small country , and our family is really important ...
you are this kind of men that follow women .
only if they wish it .
i bekieve it' s your case .
i wouldn' t want someone to see us talking .
come closer , i have something to tell you .
and i can' t talk too louder .
bitch !
rape the wife of a yakusa is a serious thing .
you will die for that .
mr netah , your attempt of blackmail will fail .
i have nothing to lose in doing what will maybe condemn me .
i' m nomura , from dogaki .
take a seat .
my condolences for the death of shimazaki .
dogaki says us to follow you .
i don' t remember you .
i go out from prison one week ago .
what was your time ?
6 years .
who did you kill ?
mr mitsuru sasakibara .
you killed sasakibara ?
lets drink sak !
do you know , mr netah , you could be an invaluable help for us .
how can you ?
you like to take what you want , mr netah .
like me , i take what i want , everytime .
ryuji don' t know anything about this affair .
you did everything .
you want to become the boss , you , a woman !
did you know , mr netah , that an american woman live in hokkaido ?
maybe ...
perhaps should we visit her ?
i like your way to drink sak .
you now .
both of you will be good men .
you are the freeman !
this man is the devil .
lets go .
you go .
i finish ryuji .
salute satan for me .
now you must die , freeman .
it was my duty to be useful to you and to protect you .
it was my duty to kill you
you broke the rules , my friend .
you should have killed her
she made you being far from us .
yo came back during the night .
he was hidden but i knew he was here .
i could feel his eyes .
our ennemies would come .
he said that i would be safe .
that i wasn' t alone .
what can i do for you ?
are you emu o' hara ?
it' s me .
i have an advice for you : help us and we will let you live ... maybe .
she is alone ?
so we have to wait .
i believed you wanted stop .
we had bet , you owe me the money .
it' s really bad for you .
you are dead , freeman .
kill him !
if you withdraw the blade , you will bleed till death .
you will tell them that yo the potter killed shimazaki , boss from hakushin .
the reason was ... an old disagreement .
yo fought against the men of hakushin .
and at the end of the fight ... he was dead .
you want me to ... help you to disappear
we will go away and you will forget us .
freeman is dead .
emu o' hara is dead .
you ... are my ... ennemy !
live with honor or die now .
you have to choose .
on my ... honor !
i did not promise anything .
but i did .
our ennemies are numerous .
even if we destroy all traces , they will always looking for us .
they have to do it .
fire can' t change anything .
i don' t afraid of death .
we are living or dying but we are free .
