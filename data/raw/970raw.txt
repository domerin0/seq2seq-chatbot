come on .
morning , sweetheart .
morning .
what are you gonna do today ?
working in the workshop .
i was thinking .
maybe you' d feel better if you got a job .
we' ve been over this .
nobody' s looking for a puppeteer in today' s wintry economic climate .
i know , honey , but i thought , you know ... maybe something else until this puppet thing turns around .
derek mantini doesn' t need a day job .
not everybody can be derek mantini .
i gotta get to the shop .
we have a shipment of kitty litter coming in .
will you do me a favor ?
will you take a look at elijah today ?
he' s not feeling very good again .
which one is elijah again ?
the chimp , honey .
yeah , okay .
on the lighter side of the news , in westchester county today ... puppeteer derek mantini thrill edonlookers as he performed the belle of amherst ... with a 60 foot emily dickinson puppet .
how dreary to be somebody .
how public , like a frog , to tell one' s name the live long day .
gimmicky bastard .
you don' t know lucky you are , being a monkey .
because consciousness ...
is a terrible curse .
i think , i feel ...
i suffer .
and i' il ask in return is the opportunity to do my work .
and they won' t allow it ...
because i raise issues .
while we enjoy the pleasures of an uneasy love ... and abandon ourselves to fornication ... we were spared god' s severity .
say no more , i beg you , and cease from complaints like these ... which are so far removed from the true depths of love .

look , a puppet show !
okay , honey , just for a minute .
mommy' s waiting .
even during the celebration of mass ... when our prayers should be pure ...
lewd visions of these pleasures take such a hold . .. upon my unhappy soul ... that my thoughts are on their very wantonness ... instead of my prayers .
sometimes my thoughts are betrayed . .. by the movement of my body .
you motherfucker !
oh , craig !
honey , not again !
why do you do this to yourself , honey ?
i' m a puppeteer .
seven and a half , right ?
uh , yeah .
i' il take you through it .

welcome to the seven and a half floor of the mertin flemmer building .
as you' il now be spending your work day here , it is important ... that you learn a bit about the history of this famous floor .
hello , don .
hello , wendy .
don , i was wondering , do you know why ... our workplace has such low ceilings ?
it' s an interesting story .
many years ago in the late 1 800s ...
james mertin , an i rish ship captain , came to this town ... and decided to erect an office building .
he called this building the mertin flemmer building after himself ... and someone else , who local legend has it was named flemmer .
well , one day , old captain mertin received an unexpected visitor .
captain mertin ?
aye .
what want ye , girl child ?
i' m not a child , but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions .
i see .
well , if it' s charity you' re after ... be gone with ye , you foul demon !
i' m not asking for alms ... but , rather , the ear of a kind man with a noble heart .
well , speak then , if you must .
captain mertin , i' m afraid hat the world was not built with me in mind .
doorknobs are too high , chairs are unwieldy ... and high ceilinged rooms mock my stature .
why cannot there be a place for me to work that' s safe and comfortable ?
thy story has moved me like no other .
therefore , i shall make ye [ groans ] me wife .
and and i shall build a floor for ye ... between the seventh and the eighth in me own building ... so at least there' il be one place on god' s green earth ... where ye and your accursed kind can live in peace .
so that' s the story of even and a half .
since the rents are considerably lower , this floor has been adopted ... by businesses which , for one reason or another , have been forced to cut corners .
after all , the overhead is low .
moving story , huh ?
unfortunately , the story' s bullshit .
listen , i' m craig schwartz .
i' m just starting out at lestercorp .
where are you starting out ?
shut up !
shut up !
shut up !
shut up !
hey , shut up !
shut up !
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry , honey .
sorry , honey .
sorry , honey .
shut up !
sorry !
help !
she' s locking me in a cage .
isn' t that cute ?
i just taught him that today .
yeah , that' s adorable .
you want to do some dishes for me ?
put that down .
here , elijah .
here you go .
you know , i have an appointment tomorrow with elijah' s shrink .
uh huh .
yeah .
i think we' re finally getting down to the bottom ... of this acid stomach , aren' t we ?
come here .
just get down from the  she thinks that it' s some sort of childhood trauma .
feelings of inadequacy as a chimp , you know ?
mm hmm .
careful .
isn' t that interesting ?
mm hmm .
i find it really interesting .
so , honey , have you thought any more about us having a baby ?
uh ... you know , i think it' s just so tough right now ...
economically and all ...
mm hmm . that i think maybe we should just wait and see if this job thing pays off .
you know ?
okay .
i was thinking about what you were saying ...
about the orientation film being bullshit .
yes ?
i think maybe you' re on to something .
and 50 other lines to get into a girl' s pants .
no , no !
no , i was just talking about the you know , about the film .
here' s the thing .
if you ever got me , you wouldn' t have a clue what to do with me .
i wasn' t i was talking about the film .
ooh , what magic those fingers could work on the right cabinet , mmm .
maybe you could alphabetize me .
and don' t forget ...
i " comes before ... " u.
floris , i think you' re very nice ... but the truth is that ...
i' m in love with someone else .
i' m afraid i have no idea what you' re saying to me .
you bastard .
what ?
don' t toy with floris , schwartz .
oh , no  if i was 80 years younger , i' d box your ears .
i wasn' t toying with her , sir .
i wouldn' t
pardon me .
how old are you , sir ?
1 05 .

i swear , sometimes it' s not worth it .
i piss orange .
and i have to piss sitting down ...
like a goddamn girly girl , every 1 5 minutes .
mm .
but nobody wants to die .
ah , to be a young man again , eh , schwartz ?
maybe then floris would care for me .
but the elderly have so much to offer , sir .
they' re our link with history .
i don' t wanna be your goddamn link , damn ya .
i want to feel floris' s naked thighs next to mine .
i want my body to inspire lust ... in that beautiful , complex woman .
i want her to shiver with a spasm of ecstasy ...
schwartz , as i penetrate her wet
dr. lester , while i' m flattered you would share your feelings with me ... perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion .
all right .
you' re right .
i' il tell you what .
meet me after work today at jerry' s juiceteria on lex ... and i' il spill my goddamn guts for ya .
no , i won' t be late , lotte .

no .
i' m not hungry .
i' m sorry i didn' t call .
it was just hard to get away .
i was worried .
i' m sorry .
you know ... [ chuckles ]
you wanted me to work .
how was your evening ?

tom tom' s puncture wound is infected .

the iguana .

so i just dressed the wound ... and i' ve just been feeding everyone and putting everybody to bed .
you want a beer ?
no .
i think i' m going to go to bed .
elijah' s gonna sleep with us tonight .
i don' t think he' s feeling very well .
okay .
hm .
well , you know what ?
i' m gonna go in my workshop for a little while .
but i' il be in a little while .
okay .
tell me , craig , why do you love puppeteering ?
well , maxine , i' m not sure exactly .
perhaps it' s the idea of becoming someone else for a little while .
being inside another skin ... thinking differently , moving differently ... feeling differently .
interesting , craig .
would you like to be inside my skin ... think what i think , feel what i feel ?
more than anything , maxine .
it' s good in here , craig .
it' s better than your wildest dreams .
you' re not somebody i could get interested in , craig .
you play with dolls .
puppets , maxine .
it' s the idea of being inside someone else' s skin ...
and seeing what they see and feeling what they feel .
yikes !
it' s just that , well please let me explain .
i' ve never done this before , but ...
i feel something for you , and i' ve never felt this way before ... you know , about anybody , n not even my wife .
and i just i really feel that you and i belong together , maxine .
oh !
shit .
hm .
see you later .
hello .
mailroom .
yeah .
yeah .
what' s the file number ?
3 2 3 6 4 .
yep .
oh !
oh , you know what ?
the puppeteer told me he loved me today .
i know , i can' t think of anything more pathetic .
i' m sorry .
good afternoon , sir .
the broad hurst theater , please .
hey , say , uh ... ain' t you that actor guy ?
yes .
john , uh what is , uh john , um , uh
uh , don' t tell me .
maplethorpe ?
malkovich .
malkovich .
right , right .
okay .
yeah .
i thought you were all right in that one movie .
thankyou .
the one where you played a jewel thief .
i never played a jewel thief .
no ?
who am i thinkin ' of ?
i don' t know .
just , uh
no , no , i' m pretty sure it was you .
the , uh ' cause , uh  [ whooshing sound ]
yeah .
absolutely , doll .
yeah .
i' m just about to close up .
wanna meet at the pig in 20 minutes ?
cool .
bye .
i' m splittin ' for the day , puppet man .
lock up for me , okay ?
don' t you wanna know what happened to me ?
no .
please , this is important .
better be .
it is .
there' s a tiny door in my office , maxine .
it' s a portal , and it takes you inside john malkovich .
you see the world through john malkovich' s eyes ... and then after about 15 minutes , you' re spit out ... into a ditch on the side of the new jersey turnpike .
sounds great !
who the fuck is john malkovich ?
oh , he' s an actor .
he' s one of the great american actors of the 20th century .
oh , yeah ?
what' s he been in ?
lots of things .
that jewel thief movie , for example .
he' s very well respected .
anyway , the point is ... this is a very odd thing .
it' s supernatural , for lack of a better word .
i mean , it raises all sorts of philosophical type questions , you know ... about the nature of self , about the existence of a soul .
you know , am i me ?
is malkovich malkovich ?
i had a piece of wood in my hand .
i don' t have it anymore .
where is it ?
did it disappear ?
how could that be ?
is it still in malkovich' s head ?
i don' t know !
do you see what a metaphysical can of worms this portal is ?
i don' t see how i could go on living my life the way i' ve lived it before .
yeah ?
so i' ve been thinking , is this malkovich fellow appealing ?
maxine !
yes , of course , maxine .
he' s a celebrity .
good .
we' il sell tickets .
tickets to malkovich ?
exactly .
two hundred dollars a pop .
but , maxine , there' s something , i don' t know , like profound here .
i don' t know if maybe we should exploit it .
you think ?
i need you for this , craigy .
you' re my man on the inside .
you need me ?
i' m your man ?
sure , whatever .
hey , everybody , i' m home .
treats for everyone .
maxine ?
yeah ?
we don' t know the significance of this thing .
it might be dangerous to toy with ?
well , i' il protect you , doll face .
bye bye .
who was that ?
i' m going to be working a lot of late nights with this partner ... because lestercorp' s open during the day , so i' il be working a lot of late nights .
but it' s a good thing , ' cause it' s gonna get us out of the hole financially ...
' cause we' re gonna turn it into a business .
but i don' t understand .
there' s not
there' s no such thing as a hole , or a portal , into somebody' s brain .
yes , there is .
a brain , or soul or whatever .
i was inside john malkovich lookin ' out .
really ?
yep .
i wanna try it .
pardon me ?
i want to be john malkovich , tomorrow .
that' d be perfect , ' cause then i can meet your partner .
the thing is , lestercorp' s open during the day , so we can' t go during the day .
but if you want to , we can do it right now .
now ?
right now ?
tonight .
right now , on the way to lester' s .
i' il meet you on the side of the road by the new jersey turnpike .
i' m scared .
you don' t have to do this , you know .
no .
no , l i wanna go .
you sure ?
okay .
yeah .
it' s wet .
weird .
that' s nice .
oh !
oh !
oh , mmm !
oh !
mmm .
god .
i feel sexy .
lotte , are you all right ?
craig !
craig , i gotta go back !
no !
maybe tomorrow .
no !
i gotta go back now !
we' il talk about it later .
wow !
being inside did something to me .
i knew who i was .
it' s like everything made sense .
i i knew who i was .
but you weren' t you .
you were john malkovich .
god , i was .
i was , wasn' t i ?
i was
i was john malkovich .
i was i was john fucking malkovich !
take me back , craig .
we' re late for lester .
so tell me , lotte , can you understand a word i' m saying ?
oh , yes , dr. lester .
absolutely .
you were just explaining the nutritional value ... of ingesting minerals through a colloidal form which i couldn' t agree more with .
oh !
be still , my heart .
dr. lester , would you mind pointing me in the direction of the restroom ?
with the greatest pleasure , my dear .
you go up the grand escalier ... and once atop the stairs you' il want to enter the , uh ... fifth door on my left .
watch the step down .
it' s sunken .
okay .
thankyou .
malkovich physical development .
what do you think lester' s relationship with john malkovich is ?
that portal' s been boarded up forever .
i bet lester' s not even aware of it him the portal .
why ?
no reason .
i was just thinking .
do you think that it' s kind of weird that john malkovich has a portal ?
do you think that it might have some sort of significance , for example ?
i don' t know .
why do you think that ?
i don' t even care .
i think it' s kind of sexy that john malkovich has a portal .
sort of like it' s like he' s a vagina .
it' s sort of vaginal , like he has a he has a penis and a vagina .
it' s sort of like ...
malkovich' s feminine side .
i like that .

i' ve been going over and over my experience last night , craig .
it was amazing .
i' ve decided that i' m a transsexual .
i know it' s the craziest thing , craig !
what , are you fuckin ' nuts ?
no .
it' s just that for the first time , everything just felt right .
i' ve got to make sure .
but if the feeling is still there ...
i' m going to talk to dr. feldman about sexual reassignment surgery .
this is absurd !
besides , feldman is an allergist .
if you' re going to do something , do it right .
you get these half assed ideas , and then you do a half assed job .
just drop it .
it' s just that i really , you know , like dr. feldman .
all right ?
so i thought that i would ask him his opinion .
is there something so terrible about that ?
why do you always yell at me like this ?
sweetie , i' m sorry .
it' s just a phase .
it' s the thrill of seeing through somebody else' s eyes .
okay ?
it' il pass .
don' t stand in the way of my actualization as a man .
lethergo , craig .
okay .
i mean him .
right now ?
uh huh .

listen , can you get me john malkovich' s home phone ? " but what i had been through .
i am hungry as the winter .
i am sick , anxious , poor as a beggar .
fate has tossed me hither and thither .
i have been everywhere .
everywhere .
so strong .
but wherever i have been ...
every minute , day and night ...
i want that voice . my soul has been full of mysterious anticipations .
my soul has been full ...
of mysterious anticipation .
i feel the approach of happiness .
anya , i see it coming .
yeah ?
mr. john malkovich ?
yeah .
who' s calling ?
oh , my goodness !
you don' t know me , but i know you .
i' m a great admirer of yours .
how did you get this number ?
well ... it' s just that l
i i dream about you .
and well , even speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited , you know ?
wow , the way this woman' s talking to him .
listen , i really don' t find this amusing .
don' t call here anymore , okay ?
well !
my nipples are at attention , general malkovich , sir .
what , her nipples ?
so , listen , why don' t we have dinner tonight ?

... as the winter .
i am sick , anxious , poor as a beggar .

fate has tossed me hit her and hit her .
i have been everywhere .

but wherever i have been , every minute , day and night ...
meet her there .
meet her there .
my soul has been full ...
yes ! of mysterious anticipations .
how was it ?
i have to go back at 8 : 00 exactly , tonight .
why ?
don' t crowd me , craig .
excuse me .
are you john malkovich ?
yes , i am .
wow .
you really are great in that movie where you play that retard .
oh , thankyou very much .
i have a cousin who' s a retard .
oh .
thankyou .
so , as you might imagine , it means a lot to me ... to see retards ... portrayed on the silver screen so compassionately .
well , thank you very much .
i appreciate it .
good night .
maxine ?
it' s maxine .
hi .
i' m so glad you decided to come .
i' m maxine .
i' m john .
how do you do ?
good .
i wasn' t sure i was going to come ... but i felt , uh , oddly compelled .
you' re so beautiful .
the way you' re looking at me i mean , at him at us .
i' ve never been looked at like this by a woman before .
i think i' m sweating .
i must say , i was intrigued by your voice .
and the funny thing is , mr. malkovich ... my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me .
so , i mean so , how was it ?
what was he doing ?
he wasn' t doing anything really .
he was just hanging around his apartment .
i think he' s probably just a really ... uh , lonely guy .
see , men can feel unfulfilled , too , lotte .
i' m glad you' re coming to realize that .
you shouldn' t be so quick to assume that switching bodies ... is gonna be the answer to your problems .
you' re right , craig .
you' re right .
you know what i was thinking ?
i was thinking that maybe ... we should invite maxine over for dinner one night ... because you guys are partners and i thought that might be a really nice gesture .
i think she' d like that .
what ?
maxine ?
the thing is , there' s been some tension between us at work business stuff and i would hate to expose you to that .
it' il be okay .
i' il cook my lasagna , we' il smoke a joint , and ... tensions will just melt away .
now , when you say that i can be somebody else , what do you mean exactly ?
well , we mean exactly that .
we can put you inside someone else' s body for 1 5 minutes .
can i be anybody that i wanna be ?
well ... you
actually  you can be john malkovich .
that' s perfect !
it' s my second choice , but it' s wonderful .
it' s [ sobbing ]
i' m a fat man .
i am sad and fat
two hundred dollars ?
oh .
oh , uh , yes .
okay .
you gotta crawl in there .
oh , my god .
oh .
no , that' s what i' m saying .
see , i don' t really need an extra bath mat .
so if i get the set , would it be possible ... if i could just get maybe three ... extra hand towels uh , if i get the set instead of the bathmat ?
yes , sir .
sure , we can do that .
great .
that sounds good .
and for the color , periwinkle ?
oh , i' m sorry .
we ' re out of stock in periwinkle .
do you want to back order ?
no .
i' il , uh ... go with the loden .

i did it !
i made him move his arms across your girlfriend' s glorious tit !

it' s just a matter of practice before malkovich ... is nothing more than another puppet hanging next to my work table .

craig !
craig !

i' m sorry to have called you like that , but i was just really , really scared .

i mean , literally , i feel like i' m going crazy , charlie .
i' m sure you' re not going crazy .

charlie , someone was talking through my mouth .
you were stoned .
case closed .
end of story .
how hot is this babe ?
you know what ?
maybe it was this lotte woman talking ... because it could have been her talking through me .
because this the weird thing is ... this maxine likes to call me lotte .
ouch .

maybe she' s using you to channel some dead , lesbian lover .
sounds like my kind of gal .
let me know when you' re done with her , yeah ?
what are you talking about ?
done with her , man ?
tonight really freaked me out .
you' re nuts to let a girl go that calls you lotte .
i' il tell you that as a friend .
charlie , i don' t know anything about the girl .
she could be , like , a fucking witch or something .
that' s even better !
hot , lesbian witches .
think about it .
it' s fucking genius .
i gotta know the truth , charlie .
the truth is for suckers , johnny boy .
thanks .

what the fuck is going on ?
uh , uh , john malkovich .
huh ?
mr. malkovich , sir .
uh , um
mr. malkovich , i think i can explain .
yeah , explain .
my name is craig schwartz ... and we operate a little business here ... that simulates , for our clientele , well , the the experience of of of being you , actually .
simulates ?
yeah , after a fashion .
what exactly does that mean ?
well , it' s hard to describe .
i want to do it then .
that would pale in comparison to the actual experience .
i want to do it !
right now mr. hiroshi' s in the tube
let him do it , craig .
of course .
right this way , mr. malkovich , compliments of the house .
jesus .

i know .
i' m sorry .
it' s such an honor .
i have been to the dark side .
i have seen a world that no man should see !
really ?
for most people , it' s a rather pleasant experience .
that portal is mine , and it must be sealed forever ... for the love of god .
but , mr. malkovich , sir , with all due respect ...
i discovered that portal .
it' s my livelihood .
do you understand ?
it' s my head , schwartz !
it' s my head !
i will see you in court !
what makes you think i won' t be seeing what you' re seeing ... in court ?
hey , malkovich , think fast !
fuck !
dinner .
you know , craig , once this was a relationship ... built on love .
well , you gave up that claim ... after the first time you stuck your dick in maxine , lotte .
you fell in love with her first , craig .
yeah , but i didn' t do anything about it , out of respect for our marriage .
you didn' t do anything about it , craig ... out of respect for the fact that she wouldn' t let you near her with a ten foot pole !
that' s true .
god , lotte , what have i become ?
my wife in a cage with a monkey .
craig .
i need to go to the bathroom and take a shower .
what am i , some kind of monster ?
i don' t want to be a monster , lotte .
i don' t want to .
craig , you' re not a monster .
no .
i know you' re not a monster , honey .
you' re just you' re just ... a very , very confused man .
i love you so much .
i love you .
come on , craig .
j. m. inc .
maxine ?
lotte .
i' ve been thinking about us , you know ?
and , uh
we have to meet .
um , okay .
i' il see you in malkovich in one hour .
craig !
i hate you .
oh , elijah !
you really are magnificent .
j. m. inc .
maxine !
honey pie !
i was just heading out the door to meet you .
no , listen , maxine .
it hasn' t been me in malkovich the last time .
it' s been that son of a bitch craig .
he' s had me locked in the cage with my chimp , holding a gun to my head .
oh , my god !
he made me call you .
i' m sorry , maxine .
it' s been him the whole time .
i' m so sorry .
that' s horrible .
i miss you so much , maxine .
so but
okay , that was craig inside of malkovich ?
yes , it was him .
it' s because he' s a puppeteer , i think .
well , boy , i' m uh
i' m surprised .
that' s pretty impressive .
what ?
so if craig can control malkovich ...
and i can control craig  but , maxine ...
i thought it was me that you loved !
i do .
it' s confusing , you know ?
this is a very confusing situation .
i know .
listen , i should really get going , okay ?
' cause i' m gonna be late for malkovich now .
no .
what ?
we' il talk about this later , lotte .
maxine !
wait !
maxine !
okay ?
what the fuck do you want ?
i can explain about the portal , darling .
listen , don' t con me , maxine .
i don' t know who the hell you people are ... but this insanity is now over .
oh , shut up .
craigy .
craig .
schwartzy , are you in there ?
how did you know it was me ?
lotte called me .
she escaped your evil clutches .
really ?
well , i' m really sorry i did that , maxine ... but i' m really in love with you , and i didn' t know how else to be with you .
hmm .
apparently you can control this malkovich fellow now ?
yes , i' m getting better all the time .
i' il say you are .
hey , let' s do it on his dining room table .
then we' il make him eat an omelet off of it .
no !
shut up , you overrated sack of shit !
craigy .
yes ?
hi , dr. lester .
it' s lotte schwartz , craig' s wife .
oh !
yes .
oh , my god .
you' il catch your death out here .
look at you .
you' re soaking wet .
please come in , come in .
here you are , my dear .
thankyou .
how' s that ?
much better , thank you .
so , my dear ... what is it that brings you to my doorway on such an inhospitable evening ?
well , dr. lester ... see , i , uh
i have a very unhealthy obsession with john malkovich .
i see .
you mean , the performer .
yes .
and what prompted you to come to me with this issue ?
well , when i was here with my husband for dinner ...
i came upon a room that seemed to be some sort of john malkovich museum .
so i thought perhaps maybe you would . .. have some appreciation for my state of mind .
you look so lovely , my dear ... standing here before the fire ... in my oversized man' s robe .
thankyou , dr. lester .
tell me ... what is this strange power that malkovich exudes ?
you' ve gotta help me understand because all i think about is wanting to be him .
wanting to what ?
wanting to be him .
wanting to be john malkovich .
oh , i see .
well , perhaps you can .
but , dr. lester
i am not dr. lester .
i am captain mertin .
i don' t understand .
it was 90 years ago that i discovered a strange portal .
and and i found that this portalled to a vessel body ... and that i could live forever by leaping from vessel to vessel .
so dr. lester is such a vessel ?
yes , he is .
you still there , sweets ?
hmm .
i figured out how to hang on as long as i want .
it' s all a matter of making friends with the malkovich body .
rather than thinking of it as an enemy that has to be pounded into submission ...
i' ve begun imagining it as a really expensive suit ... that i enjoy wearing .
ah , this illustrates ... how i will move into my next vessel , malkovich ... on his 44th birthday .
that' s when he becomes ripe .
but i must enter by midnight on that day .
after that , i' d get diverted into the next newly forming infant vessel .
i don' t want that to happen .
i' d be absorbed .
absorbed ?
what does that mean ?
well , uh , trapped , held prisoner , if you like , in the host' s brain ... unable to control anything ... for ever doomed to watch the world through someone else' s eyes .
now i' d like you to meet some friends .
see , i got lonely in lester by myself ... so i figured out a way this time to take others along with me .
come .
everyone , this is lotte .
hi , lotte !
she' s a new friend of mine .
do a puppet show for me , craig , honey .
you mean , with malkovich ?
i' d love to see your work .
really ?
uh huh .
yeah ?
okay .
this is something that i call ...
craig' s dance of despair and disillusionment .
orchestra ]
that was incredible !
you' re you' re brilliant !
you see , maxine , it isn' t just playing with dolls .
oh , my darling , it' s so much more !
it' s playing with people .
stay in him forever .
my darling , how will we make a living if our clientele doesn' t have access to our product ?
well , we' il have all the money in malkovich' s bank account ... plus he does get acting work occasionally .
no , please !
shut up !
we' re trying to think here .
gee !
it is it is sort of like puppeteering .
i l i like that about it .
exactly !
and no one would ever even have to know it' s not him .
and i could use malkovich' s existing notoriety ... to launch my own puppeteering career .
oh , craigy .
craigy , that' s brilliant .
oh .
oh .
so lovely .
i' ve always wondered what it would be like to have a penis .
so lovely .
i' ve always wondered what it would be like to have a penis .
now i' il know .
really ?
i know it' s very
lotte ?
we like you .
we can see you' re a kind and decent woman ... and so ... we' ve decided to offer you a place in john malkovich with us ... if you like .
dr. lester ... you' ve been so kind to me ... and trusting .
and ... there' s just something i think you should know about the malkovich vessel .
john' s here to see you .
should i send him in ?
of course send him right in .
don' t ever keep him waiting again , you understand ?
hey , john .
great to see you .
sorry about the cunt at reception .
this is my fiance , maxine .
oh , great to see you , maxine .
sorry about the cunt at reception .
please , have a seat .
can i get you anything ?
coffee ?
water ?
no , thank you .
teresa , get me chicken soup .
okay .
chicken soup ?
chicken soup ?
larry ?
uh ...
i want to get right to the point .
from now on , i' m no longer an actor .
i' m a puppeteer .
okay .
great .
and i would like to redirect my career ... so that from now on the name john malkovich ... will be synonymous with puppets .
sure .
sure .
no problemo .
poof , you' re a puppeteer .
just let me make a couple calls .
honey ?
maxine ?
maxine ?
i' m busy .
maxine , honey , it' s on !
yeah , there' s the truth , and there are lies ... and , uh , art always tells the truth , even when it' s lying .
the enigmatic john malkovich ... one of the world' s greatest entertainers and the man who reinvented . .. how we view puppeteering .
tonight we look at the man above the strings ... and the woman behind the man .
raised in evanston , illinois , malkovich had a lifelong interest in theater arts ... and as a young man was one of the founding members ... of chicago' s world renowned steppenwolf theatre company .
from there , it was a simple hop , skip and jump to broadway accolades ... and hollywood stardom .
but nothing could prepare the public for what was to come next .
and so it was that just eight short months ago ...
john malkovich dropped the bombshell that sent shock waves ... through the entertainment community .
turning his back on his former profession , malkovich had to start from scratch ... and pay his dues allover again as a fledgling puppeteer .
hello , ladies and gentlemen , i' m john malkovich .
it' s it' s the i miss
i' m really john malkovich .
from these inauspicious beginnings ...
john malkovich' s rise to stardom was fast and furious .
his breakout performance occurred at this year' s emmy awards
it' s really good !
i look really amazing .
i' d fuck me .
if there' s anything that upsets me about it ... it' s feeling like if move into it too quickly ...
i' il be , you know , deemed an imitator .
but , um , i think that once we all get the courage ... to just follow through on our instincts , like malkovich has ...
i think that , uh , a lot of us will move into puppetry .
malkovich' s rise to fame brought about a renaissance in puppeteering .
no , no , no .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
i' m making him weep , john .
you' re making him weep , but you are not weeping .
don' t ever [ beep ] with your audience .
until the the puppet becomes ... an extension of you , it' s a novelty act .
it' s , uh it' s topo gigio .
no ?
he' s a technical genius .
he breathes life into inanimate objects .
it' s a very godlike thing ... to be able to take something and , you know , make it live .
he was the talk of the town ... from the beltway to broadway ... aided in no small part by his new wife and manager , maxine lund .
in maxine , malkovich had found his mentor ... his muse , his inspiration .
in malkovich , maxine had found the love of her life .
there , there , my dear .
relax .
this travesty will all be over with by morning .
and the crowds have been absolutely sensational ... and , um , i' d just like to thank god for giving us this opportunity ... to share our creative vision .
nothing was impossible for john and maxine in the early days .
their union was a joyous one , and together they worked tirelessly ... to further malkovich' s puppeteering career .
john malkovich , the artist ... and maxine , the entrepreneur they make this character ... this protean figure that we cal john malkovich .
but some say maxine has changed since becoming pregnant ... recoiling from the limelight ... and , rumor has it , from her husband' s affections .
i' m so sorry .
malkovich shows us ... a reflection of ourselves , our frailties ... and our , you know , desperate humanity .
that' s what makes him one of the most relevant artists of our time .
and what does the future hold for john horatio malkovich ?
well , to quote the bard , " he' s got the world on a string .
as the poet said , " the puppeteer' s voice need not merely be the record of man .
it can be one of the pillars , the props ... to help him endure and prevail , " and i believe that .
it' s over !
max ?
i' ve gotta head down to a. b. t. now .
i' ve got the " swan lake " benefit tonight , okay ?
but when i come back , we can maybe celebrate ...
malkovich' s big four four .
okay ?
jesus !
why couldn' t i have found the portal to a younger body ?
what if l what if i fall tonight and break my hip ?
like that , little girl ?
huh , lamb ?
i love you .
bravo !
maxine ?
ma
hello ?
hello ?
we have maxine .
oh !
my god .
please , please , don' t hurt her .
listen , i' il i' il give you anything you want .
please .
you listen to me , asshole .
i don' t want your fucking money .
what i want is for you to leave john malkovich now !
who who is this , lester ?
does it matter ?
we' re gonna kill maxine if you don' t leave the body immediately !
but l l i can' t do that .
i mean , if if i leave malkovich , then i' m craig schwartz again .
no career , no money .
maxine will have nothing to do
she barely has anything to do with me now .
jesus , we' re going to kill your wife , you fucking lunatic !
god .
listen , schwartz , malkovich is our vessel .
we' re old .
we' re going to die if we don' t get into him by midni
he called our bluff .
shit !
can' t we just go inside the portal and push craig out ?
no , he' s much too powerful .
schwartz would just jam us down into malkovich' s subconscious .
lotte .
if i can' t have you , no one will .
lotte , no !
no , lotte !
god , no , we can' t really kill her !
she' s carrying malkovich' s seed !
our next vessel !
hey !
help me !
