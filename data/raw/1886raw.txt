you' re okay ?
yeah .
i lost my earring .
what does it look like ?
it' s a pearl one .
it should turn up .
i' m fond of them , ' cause my husband gave them to me .
you should go .
yeah .
i ... really enjoyed that .
yes , i know .
leon ...
leon ... this is about sex .
it' s about a man and a woman joined groin to groin .
get it ?
come on .
no .
like this .
mom ?
i' m in here .
i don' t have any clothes .
you looked on your bedroom floor ?
yeah .
i mean clean ones .
when i come home , i' il clean them , okay ?
why are you jogging , dad ?
i want to get fit .
what for ?
i don' t want to die .
you are gonna die .
not just yet .
mom ?
clothes ?
then stop jogging .
mom , clothes ?
what am i gonna wear ?
see you , mom
see you , dad .
see you , mate .
see you , dad .
hey , hey , what about me ?
i' m 16 now .
you' re telling me you' re a man now ?
no , but ...
have a good day , dad .
yeah .
you too .
is there some point where a son stops kissing his father ?
apparently .
police !
get out !
you weren' t a bit hard ?
the guy deals drugs .
he' s scum .
yeah , but he wasn' t going anywhere .
what did you expect me to do ?
are you seeing anyone ?
not with the hours i keep .
what about somebody on the force ?
male cops are lousy in bed .
there is someone .
he eats in the same restaurant as i do .
have you spoken to him yet ?
we' ve exchanged glances .
oooh ...
it' s a start .
how' s sonja ?
she' s good .
haven' t seen her around for a while .
yeah , well ... she' s busy , with the boys and work ...
tell her i said hi .
i will .
have you told him you' re not happy ?
i would have thought that he wouldn' t need to be told .
that depends on how good an actor you are .
well ...
i guess i must be pretty good .
how do you want your marriage to be ?
passionate ...
and challenging , and ... and ... honest ...
isn' t it honest ?
not emotionally .
not emotionally it isn' t .
it just feels ...
like we' re ...
like we' re just ... going through the motions , you know ?
and i want more .
i want more than that .
ladies and gentlemen , please welcome dr. valerie somers .
thank you .
we don' t know what to feel anymore .
we don' t know what' s right or wrong anymore .
the confused cry of the modern age ...
we ask , " what can we believe in ?
what should we believe in ?
our politicians ?
hardly .
our priests ?
you' d be amazed at how many clients come to see me because they once believed in a priest .
it' s not supposed to be that way .
but it is .
what then ?
our parents ?
home is a sanctuary .
for the privileged few .
for most , it' s a battleground .
it' s not meant to be like that .
but it is .
love ?
can we believe in love ?
feel safe in it ?
loving someone means we have to relinquish power .
it' s mutual surrender .
but how can this take place ?
trust .
trust is as vital to human relationships as breath is to life ... and just as elusive .
two years ago , my 11 year old daughter was murdered .
her name was eleanor .
this wasn' t supposed to happen .
but it did .
it seemed to go well .
i was worried you weren' t going to be there .
i said i would be .
do you want a whiskey ?
i' ve got an early client .
why don' t we take separate cars in the morning ?
i' ve got a late meeting .
that way , you wouldn' t have to wait for me .
i' ve got plenty of work i can do .
you can pick me up after your meeting .
sure .
okay .
i met someone .
we went home and had sex .
as you do ... well , some of us do .
and he asked to see me again .
i wasn' t expecting that .
and ?
against my better judgement , i said yes .
we' ve been seeing each other for awhile .
and you like him ?
yes , i do .
very much .
so ?
he comes encumbered ... with a wife .
is he gay ?
when he' s with me , he seems to be .
does she know about you ?
i assume so .
she would sense it , wouldn' t she ?
it depends on how good he is at deceiving her .
or how good she is at deceiving herself .
v. " don' t forget " v.
hi , nik .
having a party , jane ?
yeah .
did you want to join me ?
take this inside for mommy .
well ?
yeah .
where ?
in a motel .
oh ...
did you get his number ?
is that what you do ?
i don' t know .
if you like the guy .
but he' s married .
well , what ?
he' s not happy .
he can' t be , if he' s ... messing around .
you want to see him again ?
do you think i should ?
you want me to be honest ?
no .
no .
when are you gonna take that thing off ?
it' s too tight .
i' ve got to get it cut off .
nik caught up with pete the other day .
he wants to come back .
i don' t love him , paula .
go up to the guy , and ask if you can join him .
what have you got to lose ?
just a little dignity .
it is not the issue here .
he eats alone in a restaurant .
so do i.
exactly .
oh , hey .
hi .
uh ...
jane , this is claudia .
claudia , jane .
hi .
hi .
jane' s in the same dance class as sonja and i.
i' il get going .
say hi to sonja .
sorry .
is that really awkward ?
no , it' s fine .
how are you ?
i' m good .
yeah .
good .
i' d better go .
jane .
mmmm .
where did you find it ?
paula ?
mmm .
there' s an unmarked police car in front of jane' s place .
she' s seeing a cop now ?
don' t be nosy , nik .
what ?
are her and pete getting back together or what ?
i don' t know .
what if they are ?
what do i say then ?
nothing .
well , he' s ... he' s a mate of mine .
then do him a favor and stay out of it .
the baby' s sick ?
yeah .
shit .
oh fuck ...
don' t stop .
here .
leon ?
oh fuck .
you' re all right ?
what is it ?
what is it ?
it' s nothing .
should i call ...
no , no .
just ...
should i get a doctor ?
i get this pain in my chest sometimes .
you should have told me you have a weak heart .
i don' t .
i don' t want to have an affair with ...
i don' t have a weak heart , all right ?
this is not an affair , it' s a one night stand that happened twice .
oh shit .
sorry .
i didn' t mean that .
do you worry that we don' t make love very often ?
no .
i don' t really think about it that much .
why not ?
i love you .
whether we make love three times a week or once a month does not really change that .
doesn' t it ?
is this a test ?
no .
it' s just ...
i want to know what you' re thinking .
why do women always want to know that ?
you' re up late .
yeah , i' m trying to finish this .
you want one ?
i' ve got one .
what' s wrong ?
nothing .
just had a shit of a day .
stopped off and had a drink with claudia .
yeah , i know .
i phoned her .
i didn' t know if you were working late .
all right .
fuck !
fuck !
you fucking stupid bastard !
what the fuck is wrong with you ?
would you fucking look where you' re going ? !
fucking idiot !
fuck !
oh fuck .
hey !
wait .
are you all right ?
sorry .
here' s your bag .
jesus .
what happened ?
i fell .
are you all right ?
it' s nothing .
let me look .
i' il be all right .
i said i' m all right !
i keep thinking about her .
are you feeling guilty ?
do you think i should be ?
it doesn' t matter what i think .
he feels manipulated by her .
how ?
she' s very needy .
are you trying to justify his deceit ?
no , i' m trying to understand it .
it' s complex .
mmm hm .
but isn' t it still an act of deceit ?
no marriage can be based on that .
most marriages are based on that .
you think you know what goes on in most marriages ?
what ?
because i' m gay , i can' t have an opinion ... ?
it' s not what i was ...
she' s not the victim in this .
she chose to marry him .
not knowing he was gay .
there' s knowing , and there' s " knowing .
what do you mean ?
i think some women like to live the lie .
it' s easier than dealing with the truth .
maybe she loves him .
but so do i.
then he has to make a choice .
unless one of us withdraws from the contest .
is love a contest for you , patrick ?
patrick ?
yes .
sometimes .
what happened to your head ?
i bumped it on a clothes line .
listen ... thanks for last night .
i' il lie for you to anyone , except sonja .
i don' t want to lie to her again .
fair enough .
why are you trying so hard to fuck up your life ?
you don' t know how lucky you are to have the marriage you' ve got .
and you' re pissing all over it .
it' s great your husband comes with you .
yeah .
what about yours ?
i' m separated .
ah ...
can you tell ?
no .
no , you just have this ...
kind of look .
what ?
desperate ?
no .
full of potential .
sorry i' m late .
jane , this is my husband leon .
hi .
yeah ...
excuse me , everybody .
there is a salsa band playing tonight and tomorrow at the latin .
leon .
sonja .
are you guys coming ?
i thought we' d have a nice dinner together .
come on .
you can go out to eat anytime .
i' d like to go .
i' m kind of tired .
okay .
i' il see you at home .
bye .
what was that about ?
hey , she needed a partner .
and you happened to volunteer ?
she chose me .
i' d never say anything , leon .
pete !
g' day , nik .
how are you , mate ?
drove by to see jane .
doesn' t look like she' s in .
did you see her tonight ?
no .
you don' t know where she is then ?
no , sorry .
how is she ?
the last time i saw her , okay .
that' s good .
how are you going ?
good .
good .
it' s late .
i thought she' d be home .
sorry , i haven' t seen her .
if there was something i should know , you' d tell me ?
' cause ... if she' s seeing someone , i' d want to know .
it' d be easier .
of course .
i hate this .
thanks , man .
see you later .
take care .
so why did you and your husband split up ?
i don' t know .
i just turned around one day and i realized i was living with a man i didn' t love anymore .
it was that simple ?
no .
but you knew that much .
maybe my expectations were too high .
you' re a brave woman .
you are .
most people settle for less .
i really like you , leon .
maybe a little too much .
but i' m ...
i' m starting to wonder just ...
where this might go .
i' m still in love with my wife , jane .
right .
i' m sorry .
so ...
i' m wondering why ... why have you been seeing me if you' re still in love with your wife ?
i don' t know .
it' s not something that i planned .
look , jane , i ...
this doesn' t have to end badly .
just go .
just go .
go .
it' s twofold actually .
he thinks he runs the faculty , but he hasn' t published anything decent since 1985 .
you seem preoccupied .
i' m having trouble with a client .
i' m not handling him very well .
refer him on .
i find him a little threatening .
why ?
i don' t like ... what he' s doing .
you' re judging him .
darling , you have to refer him on .
i' il see you outside .
excuse me .
i hate what' s happening to us .
i hate it .
we don' t talk anymore .
we lost our daughter .
that could have brought us closer .
do you think about her very much ?
of course i do .
i just don' t need to write a book about it .
do you think i did the wrong thing ?
i just wanted the whole ... world to know .
look at me , john .
look at me .
come on , kids .
we' re late for school .
watch the road .
come on .
in you get .
bye , derek .
hi .
hi .
are you okay ?
yeah .
i' il pop around after work .
okay .
hey , nik .
you want coffee ?
yeah , sure .
pete was over last night .
how is he ?
not good .
how' s the job hunting going ?
are you guys all right for money ?
yeah .
yeah ?
' cause if you need some money , i' il be more than happy to ...
no .
i know paula wouldn' t take it .
she' s doing extra shifts now .
you sure there' s no bill you want to clear ?
it' s fine .
the offer' s there .
thanks .
it' s all right .
why didn' t you wake me up ?
i thought you could do with the rest .
i' il go have my shower .
actually , i' ve got an early start .
i' il only be 10 minutes .
just take your own car .
come on , wait for me , please .
jesus .
sorry .
i have a lecture tonight anyway .
so , you' il be home late ?
yeah .
bye .
i think he' s having an affair .
he' s distant , preoccupied ,
like he' s holding something back from me .
what would you do if he was ?
i ...
i think i' d leave .
yeah .
and does that scare you ?
yeah .
i' m ...
i' m middle aged .
i don' t know what it' s like out there .
you know ?
and i have these two ...
beautiful boys .
but i ...
i would survive if i had to .
i like being this age .
and i ...
i like the lines around my eyes .
i don' t know if he does , but ...
i do .
it' s not that he might have slept with another woman , you know ?
it' s that he might not tell me .
that would be the betrayal .
do you still love him ?
valerie ?
patrick phelan is here .
give me a minute , okay ?
you don' t like me , do you ?
is it important to you ?
would it make a difference if i were straight ?
i don' t have a problem with your sexuality .
but it is a problem that i' m having an affair with a married man .
you must stop trying to make me the subject .
it' s just another form of defense .
i' m curious about your role in this triangle .
my role ?
i' m a respite from a marriage that' s gotten too hard .
how ?
he takes refuge in me .
in what i offer him .
what do you offer him ?
sex unencumbered by need .
why doesn' t he leave her ?
good men don' t know how to leave their wives .
good men or cowardly men ?
he told me that making love to her was like trying to fill an empty well .
what did you say ?
what ?
you said something to me .
no , i didn' t .
yes , you did !
i didn' t say anything .
you heard him , didn' t you ?
this is bullshit ...
bullshit ?
yeah .
i want your name .
give me your name !
i want your name !
a bourbon , please .
a double bourbon with ice .
thanks .
you all right ?
yeah .
you sure ?
you don' t look all right .
what ?
are you a cop ?
yeah .
really ?
really .
sorry , i just ... something weird really happened .
i was walking and this woman started yelling at me .
she thought i said something to her .
what for ?
i don' t know .
i was walking down the street and she went nuts .
did you ?
no .
i didn' t do anything .
i don' t do stuff like that .
take it easy .
i believe you .
sorry .
it was just really weird and ... now you' re a cop , so that' s really weird .
sorry .
you want another drink ?
yeah .
thanks .
same again .
sharon said there' s a booze bus on the freeway .
i' il take the backroad home .
hannah !
yeah ?
grab dad' s wallet from the kitchen .
yeah .
hey .
she asked me for coffee this morning .
who ?
jane .
what for ?
i don' t know .
i can' t find it !
it' s near the fridge .
i don' t know .
she' s trying to come on to me .
what ?
she' s lonely , nik .
and you' re bored .
that' s a lethal combination .
stay away from her .
what' s the matter ?
you' re a bit jealous , huh ?
huh ?
you ever fuck with our marriage , and i cut your balls off .
i' il hang them on the lawn , between your socks and your jocks .
got it ?
sure , babe .
wake me up when you get home .
huh ?
i' m running down this hill , and i go around this corner .
and suddenly , there' s this guy , and bam !
right into him .
right away , i' m going after him ...
you fucking prick !
look where you' re going .
but it was your fault .
well , yeah .
i don' t know why i went at him .
it was just ... my buttons got pushed or something .
anyway , so i look down , and there he is , on the ground , cowering .
huh ?
he' s got blood on his face ...
and he broke his fucking nose .
oh no .
and he gets up and he starts to role play .
and that' s when it happens .
what ?
he starts to cry .
what for ?
i don' t know .
what makes a man cry like that ?
yeah , a lot of things .
so what did you do ?
i just held him .
i just stood there and i held him .
but the whole time i was thinking ,
you fucking weak prick , pull yourself together .
don' t you want to cry sometimes ?
yeah , but ...
you don' t , do you ?
mmm .
hey .
we ordered your food , but we ate it .
what' s that smell ?
where' s your mom ?
dancing .
where' s your brother ?
upstairs .
shit .
sam !
sam ?
sam !
sam !
what the fuck is going on ?
for christ' s sake , i' m a cop !
all right , you get the good stuff .
don' t you smart mouth me .
what' s going on ?
your brother is being an idiot .
so what' s new ?
did you know about this ?
have you tried it ?
if you ever give your brother that shit ...
as if i' d give ...
shut up !
no ...
shut up !
give your brother this stuff , i' il give you a thumping you won' t forget .
i don' t care how big you get !
give me the rest .
that' s it .
get downstairs .
you' re grounded , mate .
what ?
oh shit .
oh god .
you' re a very beautiful woman , sonja .
i' d like to fuck with you .
can i have a whiskey , dry please ?
excuse me .
hello .
you look like you' re enjoying yourself .
yeah , i am .
it' s good you' re having fun , while our son' s at home smoking pot .
i know .
i told him if he' s gonna do it , he should do it at home
so we can control it .
why didn' t you tell me ?
because you haven' t been around much lately .
i' m not having drugs in the house .
what are you gonna do ?
banning it won' t solve the problem .
what are you doing here ?
what ?
what are you doing here ?
most of the guys here aren' t much older than our son .
i thought we' d go back to your place .
we can' t .
my mother .
wait .
slow down .
stop .
get off .
jesus !
what' s wrong ?
i' m sorry .
this was a bad idea .
sorry .
fucking uptight bitch !
hello ?

patrick .
he' s a client and he' s ...
he' s gay .
i don' t understand this .
i don' t understand ... us ... anymore .
i don' t want this to be happening to us .
oh ...
there are lights .
there' s a car coming .
i' il wave it down .
wait for me .
we' il talk when i get home , okay ?
bye .
i love you .
you need sleep .
you wish .
what have we got ?
locals got a call , about 12 : 30 am from the husband .
he gets home late , his wife' s not there .
she' s left messages on the answering machine , saying she ran off the road , she' s making a call from a phone box , about 2kms down the road .
last call says she saw a car coming , she' s gonna wave it down .
but she never makes it . $50 says it' s the husband .
you' re on .
mr. somers ?
knox .
my wife' s name' s somers .
i' m detective zat .
this is my colleague , detective weis .
we' ve located your wife' s car , mr. knox .
do you mind if we come in ?
mr. knox , it appears that your wife ran off the road .
there' s a telephone box several kilometers further along .
should i go there ?
we' re conducting a search , but ... if she accepted a lift from somebody , it' s unlikely she' il be there .
would you mind answering a few questions ?
i' ve been through all this with the police .
i know , but would you mind telling me what happened last night ?
i got home around midnight .
her car wasn' t here .
i came in , i checked the machine .
there were a couple of calls .
the last message said there was a car coming and she was going to wave it down .
that' s when you called the police ?
no , i waited about 20 minutes .
that' s how long it would have ...
so you called at about 12 : 20 ?
yes , more or less .
do you have a photo of your wife we could have , please ?
thank you .
how was your wife yesterday ?
fine .
nothing troubling her ?
no .
i am trying to find out about your wife' s emotional state .
right now , i' d say it' s pretty bad , wouldn' t you ?
none of this is particularly pleasant .
i can imagine .
imagine what ?
you' re married ?
yeah .
if your wife got into a stranger' s car ... a man , let' s assume ... and didn' t come home , what would you imagine ?
right now , i' d be going mad .
yeah .
mr. knox , we need the tape .
she ... this is private .
in what sense ?
she' s upset .
she wasn' t expecting anyone to listen to it .
i' il make sure this is returned to you .
you didn' t wake me up last night .
i got in late .
what' s with the face ?
i fell over .
you were pissed ?
a little .
come on , kids .
you packed your bag , hannah ?
quickly .
come on .
hi !
hi .
hi .
seatbelts on , quickly .
nik got in late last night .
got nothing better to do than spying ?
what ?
what ?
you know , don' t invite nik in for coffee when i' m not here .
all right ?
paula ? !
hey .
that' s the appointment book .
all her notes and session tapes are kept in a filing cabinet .
do you mind ?
no .
how was she yesterday ?
all right .
is she the kind of person that would get into a stranger' s car ?
no .
not after what happened to her daughter .
sarah , i' d like you to print me a list of her current clients ,
addresses and phone numbers too .
is that ethical ?
probably not .
it' s not that he might have ... slept with another woman ... it' s that he might not tell me .
that would be the betrayal .
do you still love him ?
good evening .
richard morecroft with abc news .
the police are inquiring into the disappearance of a woman in bushland , north of the city .
psychiatrist valerie somers was last seen on friday night .
her car was found abandoned along the lower ridge road .
she might have accepted a lift from a passing motorist .
ms. somers has recently completed a book about the murder of her own daughter .
the body of 11 year old eleanor knox was found dumped in a city laneway 18 months ago .
police are appealing to the public for information regarding ms. somers ' disappearance .
why do you think she turned off the freeway ?
some people say it' s shorter .
who' s patrick ?
i don' t know .
she mentioned she was having some trouble with a client .
what kind of trouble ?
she didn' t go into it .
she doesn' t talk about her clients .
why not ?
it' s unprofessional .
even between husband and wife ?
yes .
i tell my wife everything .
that surprises me .
why ?
most men hold something back .
you' re some kind of academic , aren' t you ?
i' m dean of law .
i studied at harvard .
that' s where valerie and i met .
i don' t understand why she' d get into a car with a stranger .
maybe she didn' t .
maybe she knew him .
how' s your marriage been lately ?
fine .
how' s yours ?
up and down .
where were you friday night ?
am i a suspect in my wife' s disappearance ?
where were you friday night ?
i was at work .
can anybody verify that ?
no , i was alone .
nobody saw me .
nine times out of 10 when a wife goes missing , the husband knows something about it .
you' re a prick .
the young constable will give you a ride .
anyway , we' ve been seeing each other for a while .
and you like him ?
yes , i do .
very much .
so ?
he comes encumbered ... with a wife .
don' t you have a home to go to ?
yes .
do you ?
did you find anything ?
she dedicated the book to john .
for teaching me to trust again .
did you listen to phelan' s tapes ?
yeah .
what did you think ?
she didn' t like the man .
go home .
you got an early start .
what about you ?
soon .
okay .
you really look like shit .
go home .
thank you .
talked to mystery man yet ?
he never came back .
silly bugger .
i' m not asleep .
did you watch the news ?
yeah .
will you find her ?
it' s not looking good .
i saw her client list , sonja .
why didn' t you tell me ?
because it was private .
it was just something i had to do .
there was a time when there was no private between you and me .
that is because i had somebody i could talk to .
i have to tell you something ...
i have to tell you ...
i had an affair .
i slept with her twice .
i know it hurts you .
it hurts her ...
why ?
because i' m numb .
i can' t feel anything anymore .
just totally fucking numb .
why did you sleep on the couch ?
i came in late last night .
i didn' t want to wake your mama .
are you fighting ?
yeah , a bit .
why ?
there' s something we' ve got to sort out .
you all right , mom ?
yeah .
i' il be in the car .
can you grab something to eat ?
we' re running late .
are we gonna talk about this ?
or you just going to punish me ?
this is how you' re gonna punish me ?
i fucked up .
people fuck up .
really ?
i don' t .
you know what' s so easy ?
it' s easy to go and find somebody .
you know what' s hard ?
what' s hard is not to .
sonja , listen .
i just want ...

mr. phelan .
we' re investigating the disappearance of valerie somers .
we were hoping you could help us .
it' s not a good time .
i was out late .
who with ?
mr. phelan , the woman' s missing .
you know what' s happened to her ?
not yet .
you had an appointment with her ?
can you tell us how she was ?
she seemed all right .
i don' t know .
you don' t know ?
she' s the therapist .
i wasn' t focused on how she was .
how do you get along with her ?
fine .
that' s it ?
fine ?
we didn' t end our last session on very good terms .
why is that ?
we disagreed about something .
what was that ?
what ?
that guy you' ve been fucking ?
married guy ?
how did you know about that ?
she records all her sessions .
that' s private ...
yes , but under the circumstances ...
that' s my life !
is there somebody in that room ?
who is it ?
your boyfriend ?
could you ask him to come out ?
he has nothing ...
leon !
what' s the matter with you ?
you don' t have the right ...
who are you ? !
you have no fucking right !
finished ?
that went well .
your marriage is falling apart and so are you .
it' s none of your business .
it is if you can' t do your job !
if you don' t like the way i' m handling things , take it up at the station .
push .
hello ?
dylan ?
hi , dad .
could i speak to your mom ?
no , she' s still pissed off at you .
all right .
tell her ... tell her i' il be home soon .
all right .
see you , dad .
what did he say ?
he said that he' s sorry , that he loves you , and he wants you to stop being angry with him .
you look bereft , leon .
the other question is , why don' t you ?
don' t be deceived by appearances .
want a whiskey ?
somebody may have hurt your wife .
i need to know if it was you .
i didn' t hurt her .
she was upset on the phone .
she was afraid .
of what ?
of being alone .
of me not being there for her .
why weren' t you there for her ?
while your wife was in some phone box , calling for your help , where were you ?
are you seeing someone else ?
is it an affair ?
no .
with a man ?
is that what' s going on ?
i believe that' s what valerie thought was going on .
what are you talking about ?
for some reason , she believe you were involved with patrick phelan .
is that it ?
were you seeing men on the side ?
i don' t have to listen to this ?
yes , you do .
my wife' s out there somewhere .
what are you doing about it ?
i' m trying to find her .
but i need to know what' s inside her head .
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
have you ever cheated on your wife ?
no .
never desired another woman ?
yes , of course .
but you never acted on it ?
no .
well , you' re a better man than i am .
so there is someone else ?
no .
there was someone once .
a woman .
once that' s happened , you' re never entirely believed again .
something gets broken , permanently .
trust , i suppose .
when that happens , anything' s possible , it would seem .
you don' t lose a daughter , like we lost eleanor , without some damage .
so where were you ?
i left work late .
i stopped at the place where my daughter was killed .
i go there ... a lot .
valerie didn' t know that .
you didn' t tell her ?
why not , john ?
what holds your marriage together , leon ?
loyalty ?
love ?
maybe habits sometimes , passion , our kids .
ours was held together by grief .
there wasn' t much else left .
you didn' t love her anymore ?
i' m saying that sometimes , love isn' t enough .
leon !
where the hell have you been ?
we got a call from a man , saying his wife saw a neighbor throw a shoe into a vacant lot on the night valerie disappeared .
she' s got the shoe .
black leather .
where are we going ?
this could be tricky .
why ?
i know the woman .

the police don' t patrol it .
it must have been about ... a quarter to 12 : 00 ... and i see this woman standing at the side of the road .
i don' t want to stop .

i' m nik .
it turns out she lives in one of those houses by the bay .
there' s a string of houses along there .
it' s out of my way .
it' s in the opposite direction .
she doesn' t say much .
i can tell she doesn' t want to talk , so i just ...
leave it .
but i know this shortcut and i just don' t ...
i just don' t think .
and before i can say , " this is the short way , " she' s gone .
what do you mean , she' s gone ?
hey !
wait !
i' m not going to hurt you .
trust me !
you know ...
i thought that ... if i' d leave her alone ... she' d stop being afraid of me .
i just ...
i just left her there .
when i got home , i saw her ...
i saw her shoe on the floor of my car .
and i ...
jesus , i just wanted to help the woman ...
why didn' t you report it , nik ?
because i thought she' d be all right .
i thought she' d find her way out of there .
then when i ... and when i saw her on the news ... that she was missing , i ...
by then who was going to believe me ?
thank you ... for letting me know .
bye .
paula ?
come in .
hi .
hey , sweetie .
daddy will be home soon .

yeah .
i still love him .
i don' t want to lose you .

i don' t want to lose you .
i couldn' t bear it .
