<i>random thoughts</ i> <i>for valentine' s day , 2004 . </ i>

<i>it' s just tiny little rocks . </ i>
<i>if only i could</ i> <i>meet someone new . </ i>
<i>i guess my chances of that happening</ i> <i>are somewhat diminished, </ i> <i>seeing that i' m incapable</ i> <i>of making eye contact</ i> <i>with a woman i don' t know . </ i>
<i>maybe i should</ i> <i>get back together with naomi . </ i>
<i>she was nice . </ i>
<i>nice is good . </ i>

mm mmm .
there' s no such thing as this .

it' s all right .
carrie , i am making a birdhouse .
<i>what can i say , joel ? </ i>
<i>you know clementine .
she' s like that . </ i>
she' s impulsive .
she decided to erase you almost as a lark .
a lark .
why ?
why ?
why ?
why did you do that ?
<i>wait , wait , wait , wait ! </ i>
i' m sorry , doctor .
he just barged right in here .
okay .
i want it done .
i told him pre valentine' s day is our busy time .
oh , th th that' s ... that' s okay , mary .
but there are people waiting .
mr. barish , if you' d like to , uh ... to come inside .
and , mary , if you could take care of mrs. woo .
good bye , mrs. woo .
<i>yes , of course . </ i>
now , the , uh ... the first thing we need you to do , mr. barish , <i>is to go home ... </ i> <i>and collect everything you own</ i> <i>that has some association with clementine . </ i>
<i>anything . </ i>
<i>and we' il use these items to create</ i> <i>a map of clementine in your brain . </ i>
<i>okay ? </ i>
<i>so we' il need , uh, </ i> <i>uh , photos , clothing , gifts, </ i> <i>books she may have bought you, </ i> <i>cds you may have bought together, </ i> <i>journal entries . </ i>
<i>we want to empty your home ... </ i>
<i>we want to empty your</ i> life <i>of clementine . </ i>
<i>and after the mapping is done, </ i> <i>our technicians will do the erasing</ i> <i>in your home tonight . </ i>
<i>that way , when you awake</ i> <i>in the morning, </ i> <i>you' il fixind yourself in your own bed</ i> <i>as if nothing had happened ... </ i> <i>a new life awaiting you . </ i>
wake up , buddy !
<i>no , i' m sorry , mrs. sobel . </ i>
<i>you can' t have the procedure done</ i> <i>three times in one month . </ i>
well , it' s just not our policy ...
how are you today , mr. barish ?
<i>hello .
i' m right here . </ i>
i know it' s an emergency , and we' il do everything we can ...
we can fit you in on the first of march .
<i>maybe you could talk to the doctor, </ i> <i>a and he ... </ i>
<i>all right , so let' s make an appointment . </ i>
<i>what day would you like</ i> <i>to come in this week ? </ i>
mr. barish .
um , he' s really busy this afternoon .
<i>maybe tomorrow would be better . </ i>
<i>around 12 : 15 ?
can you do that ? </ i>
february is very busy for us because of valentine' s day .
this is , uh , stan fink , <i>one of our most experienced</ i> <i>and skilled technicians . </ i>
he' il be handling your case tonight .
great to meet you , mr. barish .
my name is joel barish , and i' m here to erase clementine kruczynski .
very good .
now , tell me about , uh , clementine .
uh , i was ...
living with this woman , naomi , uh , a couple years ago , and my friends rob and carrie invited us to this party at the beach ...
i don' t like parties .
<i>naomi couldn' t go , but i went ... </ i> <i>and i , uh , met clementine . </ i>
i' m sorry .
let' s start with your most recent memories ... and work backwards from there , more or less .
there' s an emotional core ... to each of our memories , and when you eradicate that core it starts its degradation process .
by the time you wake up in the morning , all the memories we' ve targeted will have withered and disappeared , as in a dream upon waking .
is there any risk of brain damage ?
well , uh , technically speaking , the procedure <i>is</ i> brain damage , but it' s on a par with a night of heavy drinking .
nothing you' il miss .
comfortable ?
what we' re doing here , mr. barish , is actually creating a map of your brain .
<i>okay , let' s get started . </ i>
<i>if we want to get</ i> <i>this procedure underway tonight, </ i> <i>we have some work to do . </ i>
i want you to react to these objects , mr. barish , if you will .
there' s a good story behind this one ...
uh , actually , mr. barish , i' il get a much better emotional readout ... if you refrain from any sort of verbal description of the items .
just try to focus on the memories .
oh .
sorry .
okay .
<i>healthy activity up there again . </ i>
<i>healthy readouts .
very good . </ i>
here' s another object . <i> </ i> <i>that' s so ... </ i>
next item .
okay .
potato head .
next item .
okay . <i> </ i>
<i>just focus on the memories . </ i>
<i>patrick , do me a favor . </ i>
<i> hey , patrick, </ i> <i>do me a favor , will ya ? </ i>
<i> yeah . </ i>
<i>can you check the voltage regulator ? </ i>
<i>what do we got there ? </ i>
uh , voltage looks fine .
really ?
well , i' m not wiping as clean as i like here .
i' m ...
<i>well , uh , technically the procedure</ i> is <i>brain damage . </ i>
check the , uh ...
check the connections , please .
oh , there you are .
i ...
why am i ...
i don' t understand what i' m looking at .
why am i standing here and ...
oh , my god .
dj vu .
dj vu .
this is so ...
all right , we should get started .
if we' re gonna get the procedure ...
underway tonight , we have some work to do .
i' m in my head already , aren' t i ?
i suppose so .
uh , this is about right .
this is what it ...
this is what it would look like .
very good .
we' il dispose of these mementos when we' re done here .
that way you won' t be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home .
ah , there we go .
patrick ?
<i>yeah ? </ i>
<i>patrick , can you check ... </ i>
patrick ?
<i>i' m getting some sort of readout</ i> <i>of my own voice . </ i>
patrick ?
patrick ?
why are there so many wires ?
<i> a lot of equipment . </ i>
does that help ?
<i> are you sure</ i> <i>you set that thing up properly ? </ i>
<i> how' s that ? </ i>
<i> how are you today, </ i> <i>mr .
barish ? </ i>
there we are , mr. barish .
<i> that' s better . </ i>
i don' t know if i like this .
think i might try this , then .
we' re almost done now .
<i>mmm .
journal . </ i>
<i>that would be invaluable . </ i>
<i>" i met someone tonight . </ i>
<i>i don' t know what to do . </ i>
<i>her name is clementine, </ i> <i>and she' s amazing . " </ i>
whoa !
jesus !
what ?
what ?
come on !
careful !
step back !
<i>just take it easy . </ i>
that' s fine .
let' s not roach the guy .
all right , you got that one .
this place is sort of a dump , don' t you think ?
<i>it' s an apartment , patrick . </ i>
patrick .
<i>well , not a dump , then, </ i> <i>but sorta plain .
uninspired . </ i>
<i>and there' s sort of</ i> <i>a stale smell . </ i>
<i>patrick , can we just please</ i> <i>get through this ? </ i>
we got a very long night ahead of us .
come on .
<i>yeah .
yeah . </ i>
<i>this is the last time i saw you . </ i>

no , see , clem ,
i assume you fucked someone tonight .
isn' t that how you get people to like you ?
<i>i' m sorry .
okay ? </ i>
clem , i didn' t mean it .

<i>do you like quotes , howard ? </ i>
what do you mean ?
<i>oh , you know, </ i> <i>like famous quotes ? </ i>
i find reading them inspirational , and in my reading , i' ve come across some i thought you might like too .
oh , well , i ...
i' d love to hear some .
<i>there' s one that goes, </ i>
blessed are the forgetful , for they get the better even of their blunders .
<i>that' s nietzsche , right ? </ i>
yeah .
and here i thought i could tell you something you didn' t know .
oh , no .
it' s ...
it' s a good quote .
i' m happy we both know it .
yeah .
oh , and there' s this other one i like .
it' s by pope alexander , and it goes ...
<i>alexander pope ? </ i>
oh , yeah .
<i>yeah , shit . </ i>
<i>it' s just that i told myself</ i> <i>not to say " pope alexander" </ i> <i>and sound like a dope, </ i> and then i go ahead and say it .
it' s no big deal .
you' re such a sweetheart .
<i>the quote goes , " how happy is</ i> <i>the blameless vestal' s lot ? </ i>
<i>" the world forgetting, </ i> <i>by the world forgot . </ i>
<i>" eternal sunshine</ i> <i>of the spotless mind . </ i>
<i>each prayer accepted</ i> <i>and each wish resigned . " </ i>
<i>i want to be</ i> <i>a great big , huge elephant ... </ i> <i>with a huge trunk like that . </ i>
clem ?
clementine ?

it' s fine .
i i i i i ...
i' m happy to hear ...

but i' m just a fucked up girl who' s looking for my own peace of mind .
don' t assign me yours .
i remember that speech really well .
i had you pegged , didn' t i ?
you had the whole human race pegged .
hmm .

i still thought you were gonna save my life , even after that .
mmm .
i know .
it would be different ... if we could just give it another go around .
remember me .
try your best .
maybe we can .
okay , so just tell me what you remember , and , uh , then we' il take it from there .
okay .
i liked you immediately .
<i>you didn' t</ i> <i>come on to me at all . </ i>
<i>i liked that . </ i>
<i>i was so tongue tied</ i> <i>around you at fixirst . </ i>
<i>i wanted you to think</ i> <i>i was smart . </ i>
i couldn' t wait to come to work .
i had these fantasies of us being married ... and having kids and ... just ...
<i>oh , howie , i can' t do this . </ i>
<i>we agreed it' s for the best , mary . </ i>
<i>yeah , i know . </ i>

<i>i' m drawn to someone' s back . " </ i>
<i>you were in that orange sweatshirt</ i> <i>that i would come to know so well ... </ i> <i>and even hate , eventually . </ i>

yeah .
i don' t ever know what to say .

last night .
that' s better .
this is weird .
<i> to all patients</ i> <i>of dr. howard mierzwiak . </ i>
<i>my name is mary svevo . </ i>
we' ve met , but you don' t remember me .
i worked for a company you hired to have part of your memory erased .
<i>i have since decided</ i> <i>that this is a horrible ... </ i>
some kind of teaser ad or something .
<i>in order to correct this, </ i> <i>i' m sending everyone' s fixile back to them . </ i>
<i>my name is clementine kruczynski . </ i>
<i>i' m here to erase joel barish . </ i>
what is this ?
i don' t know .
<i>he' s boring . </ i>
<i>is that enough reason</ i> <i>to erase someone ? </ i>
<i>i' ve been thinking lately</ i> <i>how i was before and how i am now, </ i> <i>and it' s like he changed me . </ i>
<i>i feel like i' m always pissy now . </ i>
<i>i don' t like myself when i' m with him . </ i>
<i>i don' t like myself anymore . </ i>
<i>i can' t stand to even look at him . </ i>
<i>that pathetic , wimpy , apologetic smile . </ i>
<i> that sort of wounded puppy shit</ i> <i>he does , you know ? </ i>
what are you doing ?
i' m not doing anything .
<i>the bloom is certainly</ i> <i>fucking off the rose at this point . </ i>
are you screwing with me ?
no !
you are screwing with me .
joel , i' m not !
you clearly are .
look , let' s just take a minute and ...
patrick , get the fuck away .
oh , sweetheart ...

can we talk about it ?
no !
get the fuck away !
joel barish .
<i>hey , clementine . </ i>
hey .
nice to see you .
yeah .
yeah .
<i>really very educated . </ i>
<i>i mean , she' s smart , i think, </ i> <i>but not educated . </ i>
<i>i couldn' t really talk to her</ i> <i>about books , you know ? </ i>
she' s more of a magazine reading girl .
<i>her vocabulary leaves</ i> <i>something to be desired . </ i>
<i>sometimes ... </ i>
<i>i was embarrassed in public ... </ i>
<i>hi . </ i>
<i>because she would pronounce ... </ i>
<i>library " libary . " </ i>
<i>hi . </ i>
<i>libary .
libary . </ i>
look what i found .
<i> i think if there' s</ i> <i>a truly seductive quality</ i> <i>about clementine, </ i> <i>it' s that her personality promises</ i> <i>to take you out of the mundane . </ i>
<i>you made me look skinny . </ i>
<i>amazing , burning meteorite ... </ i> <i>will carry you to another world</ i> <i>where things are exciting . </ i>
<i>but what you quickly learn</ i> <i>is that ... </ i> <i>it' s really an elaborate ruse . </ i>
i' m sorry i yelled at you .
it' s okay .
<i>so flashy</ i> <i>in a kind of obvious way . </ i>
<i>but still , it seduces you . </ i>
joel , i really like you .
i hate that i said mean things about you .
let me turn this off , okay ?
<i> hey , it' s ... it' s only fair . </ i>
<i>where' s the real clementine ? </ i>
<i>i mean , the whole thing with the hair ... </ i> <i>it' s all bullshit . </ i>
i really like your hair .
thank you .
<i>i really like your hair . </ i>
thank you .
i do .
<i>the world' s a goddamn mess . </ i>
<i>is it some kind of a revolt ? </ i>
<i>change your hair color . </ i>
you want a drink or something ?
do you have any whiskey ?
<i>no , i don' t think her sex</ i> <i>is ... motivated . </ i>
<i>i saw it clearly</ i> <i>the last night we were together . </ i>
<i>it wasn' t sex . </ i>
<i>it was just sad . </ i>
hey .
sorry .
i thought there was more .
<i>the only way clem thinks</ i> <i>she can get people to like her ... </ i> <i>is to fuck ' em ... </ i> <i>or at least dangle the possibility</ i> <i>of getting fucked in front of' em . </ i>
<i>and she' s so desperate</ i> <i>and insecure ... </ i> <i>that she' il , sooner or later, </ i> <i>go around fucking everybody . </ i>
i don' t do that .
<i>i wouldn' t think that</ i> <i>about you . </ i>
because i don' t .
i know .
<i>because it really hurts me</ i> <i>that you said that</ i> <i>because i don' t do that . </ i>
<i>i' m so sorry . </ i>
i' m sorry about all this .
i' m gonna ... go .
i' m a little confused .
i don' t really think i can be here .
um ... bye .
bye . <i></ i> <i>i thought i knew her so well . </ i>
it was nice meeting you and all .
<i>but i don' t know her at all . </ i>
<i>what a loss to spend</ i> <i>that much time with someone, </ i> <i>only to fixind out</ i> <i>that she' s a stranger . </ i>
wait .
what ?
<i>i don' t know . </ i>
just wait .
just wait .
<i>what do you want , joel ? </ i>
i don' t know .
i want you to wait for ... just a while .
<i>okay . </ i>
really ?
<i>i' m not a concept , joel . </ i>
<i>i' m just a fucked up girl who' s looking</ i> <i>for my own peace of mind . </ i>
i' m not perfect .
i can' t see anything that i don' t like about you .
right now i can' t .
but you will .
but you will .
you know , you will think of things , and i' il get bored with you and feel trapped ... because that' s what happens with me .
