oates , what the hell is this ?
the us government offers that house to any cuban pilot flying migs for the rebels who chooses to defect to america with a russian jet .
but that' s bullshit .
we know that , but they don' t .
they figure the cubies will go for that pool , so they don' t let them near the jets .
the rebels can' t fly migs .

they destroy their own air force .

alex , don' t play that goddamn thing when i' m filing .

you called it a strange war .

well , i like to editorialise .
are you drunk ?
drunk ?
only with the memory of making love to you on the plains of fianga , with the first liberation army marching by , and opening fire .
we freed the proletariat ?
and we freed ...
i' m going to the party without you .
i don' t wanna go to this party .
i' m bad at false modesty .
you' re great at it .
you' re right , i am .
alex , you' re gonna make a great anchorman in new york .
undoubtedly i could win an emmy as a hostess , but i' m not going with you .
you could operate out of new york .
we could buy a place , burn our suitcases .
i still like suitcases .
i' m tired of memorising the president of the republic of maldives .
you tired of third world wars ?
no , i' m tired of third world elevators .
look ...
wait .

and fired you from your first job .
and then hired me for my second job .
and fired you !
some of you may be asking yourself " what am i doing in this strange war ?
another chapter in an endless struggle that' s grinding into its seventh year .
but who of us can forget the giant struggle on the plains of fianga ?
the give and take , the lunging , the parrying for position , the jockeying around , knowing full well ...
thank you very much .
look at this .
* you beside me here beneath the blue

why not ?
we just split up .

i thought it would be cleaner with me in central america and him in new york .

hey !
ah ...
welcome to managua .

well , i thought of calling your photographs " the pictures of a lost war " .
the new york editors loved it , since they didn' t know where chad was .
it kinda legitimised their ignorance .

nifty , huh ?
nifty , i say .
i' m russel price .

down here it' s called a war .
it started in 1 930 , before you were born ...
excuse me .
my spanish is not good .
what did he say ?
he said he considers it an honour to be able to photograph our war .
he' s got a real way with words .
i can tell .
you' re a hell of a translator .
i know .
i' m much in demand around here .
will you excuse me ?
lf you have any questions , just ask .
who' s rafael ?
depends on who you ask .
rafael .
comandante rafael .
he is either a marxist dupe of russia and cuba or the most popular leader of a democratic revolution .
take your pick .
hell of a face .
would he like to be photographed ?
you would never find him .
wanna bet ?
you would lose .
he' s never been photographed .
congratulations on your elephants .
oh , thank you .

you' re gonna have a ball .
alex !
hands off , ok ?
i need a translator much more than you do right now .
aren' t you hangin ' in there with claire ?
i' m hangin ' in there , like an interim post war government waiting for the palace to be overrun by younger men .
younger men ?
yeah , russel .
you know , i still only have one major weakness .
oh , only one ?
yeah .
i hold onto things too long .
i' m too loyal .
ok , alex , listen .
jody borrowed 100 rials from me in tehran .
i owe 40 bucks to dick , and he' il pay me in lire for a future in pesos .

come on .
let' s go .

alex , it' s charlie from new york .
he says a nightclub bombing isn' t big enough to hold for the world section .
there were bits of body in the piano and the song was " moonlight in vermont " .
what' s he got better than that ?
he' s got the pope in egypt .
terrific .
forget the pope .
you got the pope someplace every week .
there' s a big story down here , because it' s the first sign of fighting in managua .
get a map , charlie .
look up nicaragua .
you drive to new orleans and then you turn left .
oh , like hell i' m editorialising .

how do i know they were cla ?
because they wore name tags .
what do you think ?
we' re backing a fascist government .
i know that' s not news , but see if you can find an angle , huh ?
alex , there' s fascist and there' s fascist .
let' s not use words like that , ok ?
no , we don' t have any pictures of rafael , because nobody knows where he is .
anybody crazy enough to go and look for him is gonna get his nuts shot off .
same to you , charlie .

we' ve met , alex .
hub kittle , from lewitsky and knupp , new york , public relations .

the man has a point of view too , right ?
right .
you' re , uh ...
price , right ?
russel ?
i need to know whether russian or cuban made guns were brought in .
lf the guerillas had help , the war would have ended long ago .
well , that' s fine , but we need proof .

it' s your daughter from los angeles .
hello .
hello , darling .
how are you ?
has your grandmother spoiled you silly by now ?

looking for what ?
i' m gonna find rafael .
now , russel , we have to be clever with jazy .
don' t worry .
i won' t come right out and ask him if he' s a spy or not .
are you a spy or aren' t you ?
spy is such a nonword , mr price .
nobody is a spy any more .
russel prefers pictures to words .
you don' t have to apologise .
you are journalists .
and you' re a businessman ?
a businessman ...
that sounds good .
ok , i' m a businessman .
why was i arrested and then released ?
who the hell are you ?
no water ?
no , no water .
marcel , you told me there' d be water in the pool this week .
lf she dove in , i assure you she would not notice .
my darling , the guerillas destroyed the pumping station in masaya .
we must ration water for now .
maybe i should go back to panama ?
maybe you should .
please .
con permiso .
you were arrested because the guardia are clowns who specialise in excess .
you were released because i told them to release you .
thank you .
those aren' t the normal duties of a businessman .
but they are the normal duties of a spy .
you win , i am a spy .
there , are you happy ?
i feel better .
now we can relax .
you can turn off your little thing .
oh , i trust you won' t say anything to hurt me .
why would we wanna do that ?
ln some ways , i am a terrible spy .
i used to be much better at it , but now it seems everyone knows who i am .
i have too many girlfriends .
i like to be photographed .
i talk too much .
i always talk too much .
but my girlfriends like that .
no matter .
marcel ?
do you know who she is ?
no .
that' s miss panama .
do you know who that is ?
yes , i do .
she' s in love with me .
i' ve got to get some water in the pool .
and once a week i have lunch with president somoza to discuss security measures against the sandinista insurgents , and all he wants to talk about is miss panama .
he is worried about her .
he thinks she' s seeing another man ?
he assigned me to find out who he is .
thank you .
we all know the revolutionaries are going to win .
don' t we ?
you know , i saw this picture on a leaflet in africa .
you know what they all say about it ?
that you' re the genius that created that idea .
it was a lot of people' s idea .
have you been to len ?
no .
no , we' re going to masaya .
we understand the rebels have entered the cuartel .
you would love len .
a nice cathedral .
beautiful light .
we' re not doing a travelogue .
of course , of course .
only i have heard that comandante rafael was recently in the area .
rafael' s near len ?
well , it' s a rumour .
what do i know ?
marcel , estoy desamparada .
she' s lonely .
well , we don' t want to keep you .
it' s my job .
do you think i talk too much ?
so rafael' s near len .

no .
i dreamed about you .

yeah .

ls that an old war injury flaring up ?

i was sunning myself on the uss pueblo when the north koreans attacked .
i took a bullet in the chest .
but i was lucky .
i had a roll of ektachrome in my pocket here over my heart ...
and the bullet ricocheted over the film and grazed your cheek ...

i love you very , very much .
i' il finish this up back at the hotel , honey .
bye bye now .
i know who shot pedro .
somebody in the bell tower .
why didn' t you tell the guerillas ?
because i knew they' d kill him .
and i didn' t wanna interfere .
it wasn' t an easy choice .
i think i made the wrong one .
do you know that you didn' t shoot any pictures after that whole thing was over ?
i didn' t , did l ?
oh , jesus , i picked up the gun .
ls something happening to us ?
yeah , i think so .
yeah , i know .
how was matagalpa ?
no bang bang , alex .
none at all .
did you find anything ?
yeah .
half the press corps .
hello ?
claire .
hey !
alex .

claire , i' m tired of nicaragua .
you haven' t been here very long .
yeah .
long enough .
long enough .
you' re right .
everybody' s right .
about what ?
my cheekbones .
what do you think of ' em ?
i like your cheekbones , alex .
ls there anything the matter ?
it' s a face made for television .
you mean you decided to go with the network ?
yeah .
they' re gonna give me ten grand a week to read the news .
i' m gonna be in 60 million homes every night .
when i take a breath , all of america will do so .
when my voice trembles , all of america will tremble .
i' m gonna be a star .
my voice will be more important than who controls congress .
you' il become a household name .
i' il become a household name .
i should never have come down here .
i' m sorry , alex .
i think it' s a lot better this way .
it' s all right .
don' t worry about me .
i' m speaking in song titles .
but promise me one thing .
i' il promise you anything .
no farewell parties .
i don' t wanna make a speech to anyone .
russel ?
russel who ?
him too .
a va bien ?
comment a va ?
you' re running late , mr president .
we can schedule this for another time .
nonsense .
let them wait .
we are a stunning couple , huh ?
my stomach is like a rock .
i' ve been working out .
yes , we are a stunning couple .
mr president , you own one fifth of the land in nicaragua .
you own the port , the airlines , the mercedes dealership ...
ls it a crime to be a car dealer ?
let me show you something .
it' s said that the guardia operates a torture chamber at coyotepe .
this is a portrait of my father .
he was very special to me .
every sunday morning i drive out to the cemetery and put flowers on his grave .
i think people should know that .
would you comment on the fall of len to the rebels ?
listen , russel .
let' s grow up , huh ?
it' s easy to fall in love with the underdog , but there' s an upside and a downside to this thing .
i just wanna remind you all this stuff about a " revolution of poets " is crap .
it' s great pr though , isn' t it , hub ?
so what' s the upside ?
simple , and it could happen .
somoza destroys the insurgents , rebuilds the country , shitcans the purveyors of excess , stabilises the cordoba , and is finally beloved as the saviour of nicaragua .
our pal .
you got a smoke ?
yeah .
what' s the downside ?
commies take over the world .
seor kittle .
excuse me , russel , but the war may be over .
this is a democracy , and i have been freely elected by my people .
there were more votes than voters ...
presidente !
no me ven que estoy ocupado con esta seorita ?
vyase de aqu .
i am sorry .
i have to conclude this encounter .
something happened .
i have many more questions , mr president ...
did he tell you about his parents and the graveyard ?
yes , i know about that , but i' d like to ...
good , good .
i' il just make sure everything' s set up .
s , rpido .
my friends , this gathering was not supposed to be a press conference as much as a get together .
but i' ve just been handed a piece of news .
rafael is dead .
he has been killed in an ambush near matagalpa .
mr president !
how many people killed ?
sorry , my friends .
no questions , please .
a press release is being prepared .
call washington .
what do you think ?
tacho makes that speech about every six months .
maybe he got lucky .
hub , is this for real ?
yeah , sure .
russel , excuse me , but miss panama would like her picture taken with tacho .
ln colour ?
ok .
a little embarrassing , huh ?
seor presidente .
listo , listo .
that' il be fine right there .
how in the hell could tacho find rafael ?
russel , please .
i have my hands full .
that' s fine right there .
ls tacho lying again ?
they did kill him , didn' t they ?
what do i know ?
tacho needs a victory very badly .
he needs to prove to jimmy carter that he is still winning .
the death of rafael is the proof he needs .
carter doesn' t need proof .
he just sent 25 million in new arms to tacho .
no , no .
he didn' t .
the state department is getting nervous about what is going on down here .
en el sol , por favor .
pardon my french , but whose fucking side are you on ?
i work for everybody .
that' s a great job .
i send messages to jimmy and i tell him that the revolution is a flood which cannot be stopped , but it can be controlled .
nobody listens to me .
i can' t even get a little water in my pool .
would you switch sides , please ?
for just one more .
that' s very nice , very nice .
thank you .
i think rafael is alive .
i' m gonna find him .
thank you very much .
matagalpa northern provlnce
there' s the guy we' re lookin ' for .
terrific .
go one more block .
oh , shit !
i' m not gonna die in matagalpa .
