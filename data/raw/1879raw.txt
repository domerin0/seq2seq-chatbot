vassili zaitsev .
on this day , september the 20th , 1 942 ,
" a shepherd boy from the urals ...
arrived in the city ofstalingrad , on the banks ofthe volga .
his name is vassili zaitsev .
like thousands before him , he came to answer comrade stalin' s call .
armed with a rifle , he quickly made the fascist invader realize that ...
from now on he would be punished for every step he took in the motherland ; that from here on , the only way was back .
what do you think ?
i think comrade commissar' s been overgenerous .
let mego !
let mego !
byorderofcomrade stalin , no civilian can ieave the city .
get back !
standaway , or we wiii open fire .
standaway !
get back !
get back or we shoot !
back !
keep back !
make way for comrade stalin ' s envoy !
i carried out my orders .
i sent in all of my boys .
but the germans engulfed us .
they have artillery , aircraft , tanks .
and me , what did i have ?
the sacred duty to resist !
i have to report to the boss .
perhaps you' d prefer to avoid the red tape .
my name is ...
nikita sergeyevich kruschev .
i' ve come to take things in hand here .
this city is not kursk ... nor is it kiev , nor minsk .
this city is stalingrad .
stalingrad !
this city bears the name ofthe boss .
it' s more than a city , it' s a symbol .
ifthe germans capture this city , the entire country will collapse .
now , i want our boys ... to raise their heads .
i want them to act like they have balls !
i want them to stop shitting their pants !
that' s yourjob .
as political officers , i' m counting on you .
you , what' s your suggestion ?
shoot all the other generals who have retreated ... andtheir chiefs ofstafftoo .
m make some examples .
d d deport families ofthe deserters  yeah , that' s all been done .
give them hope !
here , the men' s only choice is between german bullets and ours .
but there' s another way .
the way ofcourage .
the way of love ofthe motherland .
we must publish the army newspaper again .
we must tell magnificent stories .
stories that extol ... sacrifice , bravery .
we must make them believe in the victory .
we must give them hope , pride , a desire to fight .
yes , we need to make examples .
but examples to follow .
what we need ... are heroes .
do you know any heroes around here ?
yes , comrade , i know one .
that' sme !
vassili zaitsev .
that' s me !
no , you' re not dreaming .
it' s your name .
we made the front page .
they haven' t changed a word .
do you have any idea what this means ?
it' s not the back page , it' s not the second page ,
it' s the front page .
the front page !
they' re going to reprint our article everywhere .
in the caucasus , in the crimea , even in the urals .
tomorrow morning , stalin himself will be sitting over breakfast , reading my words , memorizing your name .
we' re famous , vassili .
kruschevlovedthe article .
he' s promoted me to the general staff .
and you to sniper division .
well , that' s good .
it' s very good .
it' s very good .
it' s great .
it' s very great !
it' s great !
for us because we did it together .
together !
although i did all the hard work .
oh , yeah ?
you' re very lucky i can' t fight back .
why' s that ?
because kruschev told me to make sure nothing happens to you .
you' re too important .
i' m too valuable .
yes , careful of my careful of my glasses , please .
they' re new .
sorry , sir .
i' m famous !
we' re famous !
i' m famous !

that that' s exceilent exceilent idea , vassili .
we can take it even further though .
oh .
we can take it further .
yourbattle for theproduction ofcoal ... is as worthy as mine .
there' s no " k " in coal .
just just one " l.
oh , teilme ifl' mgoing too fast .

these letters can wait until tomorrow .
we shouldcarryon .
we' re not tired .
thankyou , mrs. filipov .
these people ... took the trouble to write to us .
tomorrow , we may not be around to write back .
major konig , herr general .
i was expecting someone ... else .
certainly not someone so prestigious .
i imagine you have your reasons ... for getting yourself involved in this hellish situation .
myarmy isnot designed forthis kindoffighting .
yesterday , yet again , ihadtopromote ... 25 sergeants to replace the officers shot down by their sharpshooters .
thosesnipersare demoralizing mypeople .
this city is no more than ... a heap of ruins .
but the fuehrer' s persisting .
he has made it a personal matter between stalin and himself .
we should trust the fuehrer' s instinct .
he always managed to lead us to victory .
we shailbe backhome forchristmas .
how are you going to go about finding this young russian ?
i' il fix it so that he' s the one who finds me .
vassili .
vassili .
come on , time to get up .
what ?
they have a problem in the department store sector .
they need us .
come on .
look , vassili , he' shiding in the departmentstore .
overthere .
so farthismorning , he' s knocked off five officers , plus two machine gunners .
look , thirdfloor , fourth windowfrom the ieft .
fourth window from the left .
see him ?
yeah , i see him .
there , yougot him !
greatshot .
let' s go get his dog tag .
good bye , comrade commissar .
thankyou foryour hospitality , mrs. filipov .
you can borrow whateveryou like .
i' m not sure what they would say to me at headquarters ... if i came back with an armful of goethe and schiller .
there' s some marx too .
you were assigned to civil defense at the 1 2th district ?
no , i volunteered .
it' s such a coincidence meeting you like this .
comrade kruschev was telling mejust yesterday ... how desperately we' re in need ofoperators who speak german .
i can' t .
our militia' s responsible for all the people in this neighborhood .
we' re already desperately short of men .
we' il give you a dozen soldiers for every one that speaks german .
i' d rather stay and fight .
serving at headquarters is fighting .
you' d be far more useful there .
youstayhere .
you coverus .
ailright .
we go .
take care .
ludmilla , come on .
check the stairway .
it' s a trap .
i know .
move back .
he' s still here .
they' re coming straight for us !
ludmiila , stay where you are , he' s over there somewhere .
we have to get out of here !
we have to get out of here !
just stay where you are !
what are we gonna do ?
ludmilla , stay where you are !
fuck this , i' m going .
ludmilla , no !
what does this mean ?
the little shepherd from the urals receives a new sniper' s rifle ,
a mosin nagant 7 . 62 , with its 3 . 5 power p. u. telescope .
pride of precision ofsoviet production .
i' ve seen that rifle close up .
have you ?
i' ve even touched it .
i know him well , vassili zaitsev .
ludmilla and anton were killed today , and it was my fault .
no , i' m sure that' s not true .
there was a german sniper .
i walked them right into his trap .
what else canyou teilme ?
he didn ' t relocate .
a sniper who doesn' t relocate isn' t normal .
he was verygood .
it wasn ' tjust his shooting , it washis instinct .
he was a step ahead of me all the time .
that' s because he knows everything about you .
his name is konig , major konig .
they' ve sent him here to ki to find you .
at first we weren' t sure ifthe information was reliable .
it seems he' s come all the way from berlin to stop you .
you' ve caused them so many sleepless nights , they sent their top marksman .
what do we know about him ?
he' s a major in the wehrmacht .
he' s director oftheir sniper school in zossen .
koulikov studied under him at zossen before the war .
he knowsailhis tricks .
from nowon , he' ilgo withyou everywhere .
a nobleman from bavaria who hunts deer ... against a shepherd boy from the urals who poaches wolves .
it' s more than a confrontation between two nations .
it' s the essence ofclass struggle .
i' m glad you' re so happy .
he had all the advantages .
next time you' il be even .
no one shoots like you , vassili .
she' s been transferred .
i' il see ifthey' re ready foryou next door .
hello .
you look smart in your new uniform .
make sure they don' t take it back once you' ve finished .
yeah , they probably will .
i' ve heardthe rumorabout the german , andi wantedto wishyou iuck .
thankyou .
i' il need it .
from what comrade danilov tells me , you' re going to win .
hmm .
it' s time . @@@@@@ [ russian ]
vassili !
vassili !
come to my arms .
look in my direction .
put your cap back on , you look more heroic .
this way , comrade zaitsev .
i love this little fellow .
vassili , is it true that you volunteeredforthe front ?
howoldareyou , vassili ?
do you know what this duel means for our country ?
is it true you killed your first wolf when you were five ?
areyouproudto be chailenged bythe bestsharpshooterin germany ?
the germans are starting to shit their pants .
go on , myboy , teii ushow you' regoing to deai with him .
or rather , no .
tell it to the boss .
one more question , please .
he likes good hunting stories .
look at him with pride , because he' s looking at you .
the whole country is looking at you .
forgive me , forgive me , grandfather .
so , it' s not the wolfthat chooses the hunting ground ... but the hunter .
but i' m sure your grandfather taught you that .
except in this case ,
i' m the game .
however , today what we' regoing to do ... is iure the wolf out ofhis iair ... to where we want him to be .
you' re the one whose life is valuable .
you go first .
no , no .
we take it in turns .
next time is your turn to go first , andthen it' syou , volodya .
son ofa bitch !
these are new pants .
i just took them offa captain from the 251 st yesterday .
sixteen months i spent in germany at the school in zossen .
ofcourse , those were the days when we were friends with the krauts , : when ourjoseph andtheiradolph ... were walkinghandin hand .
from here to the wire , 160meters , right ?
one hundred and fifty five .
whatever .
that' ilmake ' em sendout a repairguy .
let' s relocate .
aah !
hey , volodya !
after the germans invaded us , it wasn' t the same atmosphere anymore .
threw my ass in prison .
what were you doing in germany , huh ?
excuse me , says i , but it was comrade stalin who sent me there .
don' t bring our glorious leader into your treachery .
confess , spy bastard !
confess .
and bang !
bang , bang , bang !
well , there wasn' t a sickle , but there was a hammer .
and bang .
knocked out all my teeth .
that' s right , boy .
have no iilusions .
that' s the land ofsocialism and universal bliss foryou .
hey !
it' syourrepairguy .
i got him .
it' s about soup time , isn' t it ?
i' m going .
weil , get a move on , volodya , andtrynot to spiilit aii onyour wayback , you marxist bastard .
the enemy sniper activity reported during the past 24 hours , herr major .
two sentries shot in the train station sector .
one artillery observer in the northern sector .
one lieutenant from the 24th panzer division in the factory sector .
three telephone repairmen in the workers' housingsector .
theyalso teilme we havejust taken aprisoner who may interestyou .
i hope he' s still able to speak .
excuse me , sir ?
nothing .
thankyou .
so , teii us , volodya , which building ishe in ?
there is no way i know that .
he moves around all the time .
hejumps from one to the next .
on which floor ?
i don' t know .
we' il see about that .
undress him .
put him in one ofouruniforms .
you see , they are stubborn .
that' s the good thing about the germans .
man , you got to admit when they get an idea in their heads
right .
let' s see ifour customer has arrived .
are you ready ?
uh huh .
and now our famous shepherd from the urals , who major konig thinks is an idiot , gets up to make sure he has hit his target .
majorkonigseeshim .
aims for his helmet .
fires .
revealshisposition andis shot in turn .
except ...
major konig doesn' t fire ...
because major konig isn' t there .
koulikov !
don' t you think that was strange , that last one ?
they sent him out to get shot like the others .
it' s not natural .
not without artillery , without trying to cover him .
oh , no , i' m the one who was stupid .
they don' t give a shit about telephone guys .
i mean , it' s like us with the ukrainians .
they' d never bother a major over a few dead grunts .
tomorrow , we' il kill us some generals .
whose turn is it ?
mine , i think .
oh , you' re such a cheater !
you can' t fool papa koulikov .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , it' s my turn to go first .
and it' s your turn to get a hole in your britches .
to victory .
this sniper business has been dragging on too long .
what' s that little fellow ofyours up to ?
he' s probing , comrade kruschev .
he' s testing the germans for weaknesses .
he' s meticulous in his preparation .
vodka ... is a luxury we have .
caviar is a luxury we have .
time is not .
he' s aware ofthat comrade kruschev .
we both are .
i assure you he will succeed .
good .
it seems your destinies are entwined .
they' re keeping you busy .
i picked this up in the kitchen .
it' s from the reception the other day .
i thought mrs. filipov might like it .
um , she will be thrilled .
that' s very sweet ofyou .
there' s plenty more ifyou' re hungry .
you' rejewish , aren' t you ?
there' s nothing in our religion that says you can' t eat sturgeon .
my father had a premonition all this would happen .
you mean the war ?
he understoodthat the hatred ofthejews ran deep .
he was saving up to buy some land in palestine .
he said it was the only land we truly belonged in ; the only land we had a duty to defend .
he insistedilearn to use a rifle .
i learned to shoot .
i know that in times ofwar , personal feelings should be put aside , but ...
i have a favor to askyou .
ofcourse .
anything you want .
i want to be reassigned .
what' s happened , tania ? @@@@@@ [ russian ]
heshot him .
he shot him even though hejumped first .
shot him on the run .
it was an impossible shot .
i' ve neverseen anything iike it .
you' ve promised people a victory i can' t deliver .
i don' t stand a chance against this man .
you mustn' t talk like that , vassili .
what ifltoldyou we found a wayto trackhismovements ?
we' ve got someone , vassili .
someone close to him passing us information .
next time you will be one step ahead of him .
i promise .
@@
now i have a favor to ask .
from me ?
it' s about tania .
come in .
he doesn ' t even knowyou exist .
but at that moment , you are closer to him than anyone else on earth .
you see his face through the sight .
you see whether he shaved that morning or not .
you can see whether he' s married by whether he has a wedding ring on .
it' s not like ... just firing at a distant shape , notjust a uniform .
it' s a man' s face .
those faces don' t go away .
theycome backandtheyjust theyget replacedbymore faces .
did danilov askyou to tell me this ?
he likes you very much .
i think he' d try anything to change your mind .
did he tell you why i asked for the transfer ?
no .
thismorning , a iist arrivedat headquarters .
it was a list ofcivilians who' d been ... rounded up and sent to germany in a convoy ... that left stalingrad three weeks ago .
my parents were amongst them .
after 30 kilometers , the german soldiers ... stopped the train and forced everyone out .
in the middle ofa bridge , they bound them together , two by two .
mothers with daughters .
husbands and wives .
they ... lined them up against the railing , and then they fired a single shot at each pair ... to save bullets .
it worked .
the bodies ofthe ones who died dragged the others under the water .
i know they died together .
they never would have let themselves be separated .
that' s koulikov' s rifle .
it' s a good ... rifle .
thankyou .
i know how he leaves the shelter .
he goes through the tractor factory .
the tractor factory is big .
i know exactly where .
he crawls through a gutter , under a grate where the vats are , then he goes out from the workshop .
in between the two , there' saplace where he' s in the open .
it' s under a long , iron foot walk .
good luck , comrade .
i know exactly where he' s waiting for me .
he' il be on the foot walk over the gutter .
we' il take him out from behind .
we' il get to the other end ofthe workshop through these pipes .
foilowme .
you go that way .
i' il go around this way .
okay ?
shit !
sergei , you should go back .
no , i' il be all right .
go back .
no , you go !
keep your legs in .
come on .
come on .
come on .
comrade stalin is asking for one last effort !
the fate ofthe motherland isat risk !
the fate ofailthose you love andcherish !
it' s for them that we fight today .
listen to me , tania .
the germans are throwing everything at us .
ifthey' re lucky , one in ten ofthese soldiers will come back alive .
you' re highly educated .
you know languages .
every intercept you translate saves hundreds of lives .
every message you decode kills thousands oftheirs .
you have a duty to survive .
vassili was born to fire a gun .
it' s what he knows .
you and i were born for a different purpose .
ifvassili were here , he would tell you the same thing .
where is he ?
where is vassili ?
keepyourheaddown .
tell me where he is .
stay into thatpipe , tania .
stay in .
stay in !
get your head in !
slow down .
don' t shoot .
he' s over there .
do you see the pillar in front ofyou ?
ineedyou to move roundbehindit .
go .
tania , ineedyou to find a iargepiece ofglass .
piece of glass .
doyousee the kiln ... behind me to the left ofthe factory ?
yes ?
i can' t hearyou .
yes .
yes .
do you see ... the two louvers ?
yes .
do you see the one ... with a broken slat ?
yes .
this is what i want you to do .
are you ready ?
yes .
three ... two ... one ...
hello , sacha .
he was right where you said he' d be .
nearly there .
he' s very clever .
tell me about him .
why was it his grandfather taught him how to shoot and not his father ?
his father' s dead .
his mother too .
does he talk about his father ?
no .
he didn' t know him .
did he go to school ?
he knows how to write .
he answers lots of letters .
hmm .
is it girls who write to him ?
everyone writes to him .
is there a girl he loves in his village ?
not in his village , here .
does she love him ?
yes , because he' s handsome .
because he' s brave and she' s very beautiful .
i know her well .
she' s from my neighborhood .
she went to the university .
they' re handsome together .
later , the two ofthem wiilget married .
at least , i think so .
and you , sacha , why are you helping the germans ?
because they' re stronger .
because they' re going to win the war .
and because you like chocolate , huh ?
@@@@@@ [ dance ]
ailthesepeople here knowthey' regonna die .
so each night when they make it back ,
it' s a bonus .
excuse me .
so , every cup oftea , every cigarette ... becomesa iittle celebration .
because fora iot ofus , it maybe ourlast night .
it' sjust something you have to accept here .
everyone has their time .
in the forest , the wolfiives forthreeyears , the donkey for nine .
so , that' s that' s got to be a proverb from the urals .
it makes no sense to me whatsoever .
the donkey lives longer because he' s more useful .
makes absolute sense .
there aren' t any donkeys in the forest .
you made it up .
so ...
i' m a donkey ?
people like you and danilov ... have to survive this .
people who have read books , had an education .
we' il need you when the war is over .
andifyousurvive ?
what will the useless vassili zaitsev do then ?
i wanna work in a factory .
my granddad took me to a factory once .
there was thisman there , high up on a on a foot walk .
he wasn' t wearing blue like the others .
the people he was supervising didn' t understand what they were doing .
but for him , for him up there , it was simple ; it was clear .
and i thought , " one day , i could be that man .
sad to have a dream you know won' t happen .
why shouldn' t it ?
you' il outlive us all .
hmm .
you' il be the oldest donkey in the forest .
150metersstandbetween the germansandthe volga .
todaythe whole world is watching these 150meters .
they are what makes stalingrad ... " the capitol ... ofthe war .
your friend , tania ... have you see her ?
she stays over there now , with the snipers .
tell the major we' re sending in all ofour sharpshooters ... to support the attack on the factory .
tell him vassili will be there .
i need to talk to you .
sure .
i need to talk to you .
sure .
danilov .
hmm ?

you' ve been playing your fiddle too much !
if it' s confirmed that he' s dead , we' re sunk !

they' re lying .
that' s good .
very good .

vassili zaitsev is not dead .

you won' t give up the riverbank !
idon' t care ifyou' ve iost halfyourmen !
lose the other half , or lose yourself !
is he back ?
he should be back soon .
the german attack cut the lines .
that' s why he' s late .
can we go outside ?
i wrote to my mother about you .
she wantedme to teilyou that once this war was over , ifthere' s anything you needed anything at all our family will be there foryou .
you know i' m here foryou .
they' re saying vassili is dead .

it' sjust propaganda .
he isn' t dead .
and do you know why ?
indistinct ]
i' m going to tell you a little secret .
only you , because i know i can trust you .
but you must swear to me that you won' t tell another soul .
you swear ?
i found a terrific spot .
it' s by the exit from the train station .
i' il hide in the water tower .
tomorrow .
i' ii wait forhim there .
you' il see .
he' il be there .
he always is .
i also want you to swear that from now on , you' il stay home where you belong .
do you swear ?
yes ?
good .
we know he' s alive .
we know he won' t fail us .
we know because he is a part of us now .
vassili is eternal .
where have you been ?
we' ve looked everywhere foryou .
oh , didn ' tyou hear ?
i wasdead .
at ieast the noble sniper zaitsev ...
vassili was dead .
the real one .
me ...
i was asleep , andlmissedmychance .
then , i was curledup in a corner , hiding ... from a man who wants to kill me .
i' il talk to kruschev .
he' il send you back to your old division .
where' s tania ?
she' s at the shelter .
i' ve been to the shelter .
itoldheryou weren' t dead .
the major said so .
he said the other germans were lying .
he told me you were waiting for him at the station .
vassili .
vassili .
vassili .
my little sacha .
i knew it .
vassili .
tania .
i knew you weren' t dead .
how ?
because we onlyjust met .
i prayed for the first time since i was a little girl .
when i opened my eyes , sacha was standing there ... waiting to give me the good news .
i think he loves you even more than i do .
to thepropermilitaryauthority ,
i' m calling to the commandant' s attention the recent changes noticed ... in the attitude towards fighting ofsoldier vassili zaitsev .
he hasattemptedon severaloccasions to escape his duties , voiced doubts on the chances ofour victory ... and made defeatist comments in public .
the inexplicable duration ofhis duel ... with the nazi sharpshooter can only be explained by ... his lack of belief in the communist ideal .
good morning , sacha .
once again , he knew exactly where to find me .
don' t you think that' s strange ?
apart from me , only you knew .
i don' t hold it against you , sacha .
you' ve done a very brave thing .
you' ve chosen your camp .
i respect that .
but it isn' t my camp .
we' re both soldiers , and we' re both enemies , so i know you understand .
i' m annoyed with you , little sacha , for not staying home as i made you swear to .
i' m annoyed with you for obliging me to do what i' m going to have to do .
i' ve never seen anyone frown so much in their sleep .
how long have you been watching me ?
all night .
you' ve been snoring away happily for hours .
i don' t snore .
do i ?
like a pig .
i suppose i talk in my sleep as well .
yes .
there' s something i should tell you .
on the train ... coming here ... we were in the same car .
no .
i saw you .
you were reading , and you fell asleep .
i didn' t dare look at you , you were so beautiful .
it was scary .
afterwards , i couldn' t stop thinking about you .
it made me smile .
and then i thought ofall the men who would get to hold you ... who' d make you laugh ... how lucky they were .
and now i' m the one lying next to you .
and now i' m the one lying next to you .
was i snoring ?
like a pig .
what ?
oh , my god !
oh , no .
oh , my god !
tania , no .
tania , no !
no , get off me !
get off me !
get off me !
it' s what he wants !
this is what he wants !
get off me !
no , he' il kill you .
he' il kill you !
let me go !
i' il run afteryou , and he' il kill me .
let me go !
let me go !
this is what he wants !
i' il get him .
i promise i' il get him .
i' il get his rifle foryou .
i promise , tania .
i need you .
you have to leave now , mrs. filipov .
stalingrad may fall .
the last ofthe boats are leaving .
the germans will be here any moment .
he' s brought you a pass .
you' il be safe on the other side .
gatheryour things , and we' il help you carry them to the landing stage .
i' m not leaving .
this is my home .
this is my sacha' s home .
i can' t leave .
ihave to teilyousomething , mrs. filipov .
something very difficult to understand .
it' s about sacha .
he' s gone over to the germans .
he' s betrayed his country .
he' s with the enemy now .
he won' t be coming back .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
he' s become a traitor .
thepoorlittle thing .
what hashe done ?
so , he' s going to stay over there ?
yes ... he' s going to stay over there .
ishouldn ' t besaying this , comrade commissar , but maybe it' s for the best .
ifthe germans have won , he' il be safe .
iknowit' s wrong , butperhaps he hasmade the right choice .
oh !
oh , tania !
tania ?
oh , tania !
tania !
oh , my god !
oh !
i need a doctor !
a doctor !
i have a pass .
i have a pass !
you must let her cross .
please !
it' s useless .
she' il never make it .
no !
no , she will !
she' s my daughter !
she' s my daughter !
i beg ofyou !
all right .
oh , thankyou !
put this one on the boat .
where is he ?
where' s the major ?
a few inches from your face .
i' ve been such a fool , vassili .
man will always be man .
there is no new man .
we tried so hard to create a society that was equal , where there' dbe nothing to envyyourneighbor .
but there' s always something to envy .
a smile ... a friendship .
somethingyou don' t have and want to appropriate .
in this world even a soviet one there will always be rich and poor .
rich in gifts ... poor in gifts .
rich in love ... poor in love .
tania isn' t coming back .
she' s dead , vassili .
she was cut down byshrapnel .
it was quick .
idon' t think she even sawit coming .
she was on her way back to you .
as soon as she had seen mrs. filipov to the boats , she was coming back foryou .
she wasright .
you' re agoodman , vassili .
i want to helpyou , vassili .
let me do one iast thing .
something useful for a change .
let me show you where the major is .
don' t do that .
don' t do that !
today , february3 , 1943 , isan ominous day forhitler ... andthe endless columns ofhundreds ofthousands ofgermanprisoners .
it is an unforgettable day of hope for our motherland .
after 180days ofheroic combat ... in the market city ofstalingrad , andasa result ofthe valor andself sacrifice ofoursoldiers , the commander ofourgloriousredarmy ... received the unconditionalsurrender ... ofthe german fascist invaders .
sorry .
no , young man , i cannot find ...
a matching name in the book .
could you check again ?
this is the address and her name .
she isnot here .
yes , this is our address , but we don' t have her anymore .
this is the address .
she' sbeen here .
i' m so sorry .
she wrote to me .
ilookedthree times .
she' snot here .
believe me , there isno tania chernova .
ican' t helpyou .
i' m so sorry .
