i' m gonna call you later .
ok .
bye .
forget something ?
oh , hey .
hi .
i' m glad i caught you before you went to work .
what' s up ?
i was wondering if you wanted to come over tonight , open a bottle of wine , maybe watch a video ?
nah .
thanks , though .
and in summation , i feel that these measures will help jps and all of our customers .
nice job , hal .
thank you .
nicely done .
i appreciate it .
hal , i stand corrected .
thank you .
hal , i need to see you in me office straight away .
sure .
sit yourself down .
so ... what' d you think ?
i' il be gettin ' to that in a minute .
i want to talk to you about that conversation we had the other night , and all of them things you said to me .
well , i' m more than just a little embarrassed , having said what i said .
i think me daughter is lucky to have you .
no , sir .
i' m the lucky one .
indeed .
well , now , as to your meeting in there , sure , it was first rate .
yeah ?
oh , yes .
hal , i' m gonna level with you .
i need your balls .
sir ?
i need a man around that can give it to me straight , you know ?
whether the news be good or bad .
so i' ve decided from now on , you' il be working directly for me .
uh ...
i don' t know what to say but , um ... thank you .
well , a thank you will do just fine .
well ... get the fuck out .
ok .
congratulations on your promot ...
oh , sorry .
no , no .
come in , come in .
i want you to meet rosemary .
rosemary , this is jen and artie .
kids , rosemary shanahan .
as in steve ?
yeah , he' s my dad .
oh , god , which reminds me , i gotta meet him for lunch .
so i' il see you this weekend , ok ?
it was really nice to meet you guys .
do you mind if i take a little sliver ?
beauty .
do you want a plate ?
i know what you' re thinking .
where does she put it , right ?
you guys , thanks for the cake .
you didn' t have to do this .
the least we could do , seeing as how you worked so hard to become " indispensable " to the company .
is that that new thing called sarcasm ?
hal , we all know you' re about as deep as a puddle .
that used to be part of your charm .
but this just flat out sucks .
what are you talking about ?
if you have one ounce of integrity left , you' il break it off immediately , before you hurt the poor girl .
i gotta give you credit for being more proactive and starting to meet women .
who knows ?
maybe you are on a roll here , but don' t you think it' s time to raise the bar a little ?
i mean , at first i thought you were in a slump , you know ?
i could , as a friend , look the other way while you banged a few fatties and got it out of your system , but there' s lots of good fish out there .
you don' t have to snack on carp any more .
i suppose the girls we partied with a couple weeks ago downtown were a couple of carp ?
no .
laura , the one with the whiskers , she looked more like a catfish .
oh , i see .
and what about marie ?
pop some bolts on her neck and the villagers' il be chasing her .
and vicki ?
who ?
vicki !
who' s vicki ?
vicki vicki .
with the short brown hair .
vicki ?
i thought that was a guy .
i was calling her vic !
oh !
you' re out of your mind !
i know i' m being a little harsh on you here .
i think real friends are obligated to be honest with each other .
and this one that you' re dating now jeez .
careful .
hey , all i' m saying is she' s got cankles , for god' s sake .
what ?
cankles !
she' s got no ankles .
it' s like the calf merged with the foot , cut out the middleman .
i know what cankles are .
rosemary doesn' t have ' em .
you know what ?
i know what you' re doing here .
you' re scared .
scared ?
yup .
this is exactly what you did with the knockout with the weird toe .
you' re just inventing reasons to dump girls cos you' re afraid .
all right , look , i admit rosemary is kind of cool .
but you wouldn' t even be talking to that woolly mammoth if her father wasn' t the president of your company .
what ?
i guarantee you' ve never met anyone like this guy .
you' re gonna love him .
great .
what' s his girlfriend like ?
i don' t know .
i haven' t met her .
they just started going out .
oh , there he is .
walt !
at your cervix !
hey , you recognise these panties ?
rosemary , don' t steal my lines .
you two know each other ?
yeah !
gosh , walt' s been volunteering down at the hospital for years .
oh .
so where' s this mystery girl ?
she should be here any minute .
hey , uh ...
i want you to be honest .
is this outfit too " hey , look at me " ?
no , no .
it' s ... it' s very subtle .
sorry i' m late .
tanya .
oh .
what a surprise .
* i' ve spent all summer days drivin '
* i' m tired of holidays ruined
* no more takeaways , expired food ...
i gotta get a map .
i' m going with you .
what are those for ?
you ever walked through a truck stop men' s room on your hands ?
want anything ?
potato chips .
and dip .
cut it out .
so , tanya , i had no idea that you and walt were , you know , seeing each other .
yeah .
you got a light ?
it' s actually a very funny story .
because he had been asking me out for a really long time and i was always kind of unavailable .
and then just when he had given up , i broke up with my boyfriend , and there he was .
so i asked him out .
so he kind of grew on you , huh ?
exactly .
i mean , you gotta admit , when you first meet him , it is kind of jarring .
i mean , you kinda don' t even know what goes where .
but , anyway , the timing couldn' t have been more perfect , because he had just sold his company , and he has all this time on his hands , and we can plan things and travel and go shopping and ...
well , i guess timing' s everything .
hope you like bean dip .
* i' d already picked up all the faces
* and i , i wanna show you all the places
* and i , i wanna take a little ride
* wanna take a little ride , countryside with you
yeah !
that was my girl .
oh , my god .
i' m the biggest nerd .
rosemary !
ralph !
hi .
you remember li' iboy ?
li' iboy .
yeah .
how are you ?
mahalo , rosemary .
how you doing ?
great .
wow .
they still got you out in sierra leone ?
no , no .
now they got me nearer my home .
i' m on this island in the south pacific called kiribati .
i' m hal .
oh , i' m sorry .
hal .
these are my peace corps buddies .
this is ralph owens and li' iboy .
this is hal larson .
what' s up ?
li' iboy .
so , what are you guys doing up here ?
li' iboy' s been stuck in the office training for 30 days , so i dragged him here and threw him on the slopes .
it wasn' t pretty .
i knew this hawaiian guy in high school who went out for the hockey team .
it was funny as shit .
anyway ... it' s great to see you again .
you look ... happy .
thanks .
i am .
well , we got a long drive back , so ...
bye .
bye .
good to meet ya .
you ok ?
uh huh .
it' s just that ...
do you remember how i told you that once i had a boyfriend ?
that was him .
you' re welcome .
what' s your name ?
excuse me , mr robbins .
could i have a word with you , sir ?
sure , but i gotta catch a plane .
it' il only take a minute .
a few weeks ago , you got trapped in an elevator with a friend of mine .
hal !
he was a great guy .
he was having trouble with his relationships .
how is he ?
well , that' s a matter of debate .
really ?
anyway , apparently , you gave him , like , a ... pep talk , and now he' s under the impression that he can get any woman he wants .
and you don' t think he can ?
i don' t know .
whatever .
but , see , the point is , lately the only women he wants ... are ugly .
who says they' re ugly ?
bausch & lomb .
and very fat , some of them .
it' s like hal has lowered his whole ...
jesus , you' ve got a big noggin .
thanks for noticing .
my new book has a chapter on blurting .
you might wanna pick it up .
yeah , i' il check into that .
anyway , i mean , did something go wrong here ?
or is my friend having a nervous breakdown ?
no .
haven' t you ever heard the phrase " beauty is in the eye of the beholder " ?
yeah .
did you ever hear the song " who let the dogs out " ?
it can' t be that bad .
look , exactly what did you do to him , man ?
i altered his perception a little bit .
i knew it .
i knew it !
i knew it !
you messed with his eyesight , right ?
no .
you hypnotised him .
no .
i dehypnotised him .
he' s been hypnotised his whole life , totally focused on the outside .
i helped him to see the inner beauty in everyone , including people you think are not physically attractive .
how can he see their inner beauty when he doesn' t even know them ?
inner beauty' s easy to see when you' re looking for it .
but how can he not ... feel them when he' s ... ?
the brain sees what the heart wants it to feel .
all right , look .
let' s just cut through the old crapcake here !
ok .
sir , don' t ... don' t you think it' s wrong to brainwash someone ?
don' t you think you' re brainwashed ?
everything you know about beauty is programmed .
tv , magazines , movies .
they' re all telling you what' s beautiful and what isn' t .
how' s this any different ?
look , i didn' t come here to debate you !
i just want my friend back !
now , isn' t there some kind of word or phrase or something to take the whammy off him ? !
of course .
but if we do that , he' il go back to judging everybody by the outside .
is this what he really wants ?
i don' t care what he wants !
it' s what i want !
i want my friend back !
i gotta go .
i gotta catch my plane .
i' m really sorry .
look , a man' s reputation , dignity and furniture are being trashed here !
perhaps irreparably !
for god' s sakes , his job is in jeopardy !
his job ?
really ?
yes .
and it' s a great job .
i just wanted to give him a gift .
i didn' t want him to get hurt .
you seem to know him better than i do , so , um ...
it' s a shame to let it go .
oh , it' s a tragedy .
so , what did you wanna talk to me about ?
ralph called me .
your old boyfriend ralph ?
well , he was also my division leader in sierra leone .
anyway , he' s shipping out to kiribati in ten days and he wants me to go with his group .
what ?
you and ralph ?
kiribati ?
they' re in the middle of this economic meltdown .
100, 000 women and children need medical supplies and food , and they want me to help .
how can you be so selfish ?
sorry ?
i mean , you know what i' m sayin ' .
you bump into pretty boy ralph on friday , the sparks are flying , and now you' re gonna go and save the world in kiribati ?
this has nothing to do with me and ralph .
yeah , right .
he' s obviously crazy about you .
he' s got the heart of a saint .
i could practically see the halo around his head .
i can' t compete with that .
ok , first of all , you' re probably the only person in the free world to ever refer to ralph as a " pretty boy " .
secondly , that halo around his head , it' s called psoriasis .
you can' t stand within three feet without getting flaked on .
and thirdly , and fourthly , yes , he' s a great guy and he cares about me , but he had no sense of humour .
and i' m in love with an even greater guy .
well , then how come i don' t have any say in this thing ?
you do .
that' s why ...
god , are you ok ?
oh , my god .
i am so sorry .
you should be sorry !
this is an outrage !
i' il go get help .
are you ok , sweetie ?
thank you very much .
i' m so embarrassed .
don' t be .
it' s this flimsy ass four star restaurant .
just sit right here .
i' m gonna go talk to the manager , ok ?
i' il be right back .
good night .
thank you .
i' m not blaming you , but i need a chair .
my girlfriend' s jinxed when it comes to furniture .
i' m so sorry .
the waiter told me what happened .
just a sec .
mclntosh' s .
hello ?
shallow hal wants a gal .
what ?
shallow hal wants a gal .
what the hell are you talking about ?
i just saved your life , baby .
what ?
i' ve been looking for you all day .
i' m at mclntosh' s with rosemary .
look , i got kind of a ...
are you looking right at her ?
no , i' m talking to the hostess .
hal , don' t !
hal ...
look , i got a situation here .
i' il call you later .
look away !
i was just talking to the hostess .
right .
that would be me .
no , no .
it was the other hostess .
sir , i' m the only hostess in the restaurant .
let me apologise about the booth .
we are so sorry .
we' ve replaced your date' s side with a new chair , a strong one , and the meal' s on us .
oh , ok .
well ... thank you .
you' re welcome .
excuse me .
did you ... did you move us ?
no .
second table on the right .
well , then maybe you can explain to me why that robust woman is eating my girlfriend' s din ...
hey !
now she' s eating my clams casino !
sweetie , are you ok ?
excuse me .
mclntosh' s .
tiffany .
mm hm .
ok .
we' re two friends walking .
we' re just walking .
and then robbins confirmed exactly what i thought .
which is ?
you weren' t irresistible to women .
he hypnotised you so that really ugly girls that you met from then on
would , to you , look like supermodels .
what ?
if they had inner beauty or some baloney .
you could get any woman you desired because you were suddenly desiring the undesirable .
you get it ?
no , not exactly .
let me put it this way .
it' s like he gave you beer goggle laser surgery .
now wait a second .
so what you' re saying is that all the pretty girls i' ve met lately are not really pretty ?
all right .
let' s look at the facts .
they were funny , smart and nice .
pretty girls are not funny !
and they' re certainly not nice .
not to us .
when i found out what robbins was doing , i convinced him to take the trance away .
when i said " shallow hal wants a gal " , you were cured .
you' re out of your mind .
do you know that ?
i' m going back to the restaurant .
hal .
hal , come on .
hey , hal !
you never called me back .
what happened to you ?
excuse me ?
oh .
i' ve got my hair back .
it' s me katrina .
we shared the cab together .
i' m in town taking care of my grandma , cos she' s been sick , and ...
oh , wait a minute !
i get it !
nice try , mauricio .
where' d you find this one ?
no , it' s me katrina .
from boston .
the ... the magical fruit ?
yes , i remember katrina .
but the thing is , you' re not ka ...
i never told you about k ...
katrina !
how the heck are ya ?
give me some sugar .
i didn' t recognise you .
the hair and the ...
you screwed me , man !
i had a beautiful , caring , funny , intelligent woman , and you made her disappear !
oh , no , i didn' t .
i just made rosemary appear .
there' s a difference .
it' s called reality .
hey , if you can see something and hear it and smell it , what keeps it from being real ?
third party perspective .
other people agreeing that it' s real .
ok , let me ask you a question .
who' s the all time love of your life ?
wonder woman .
ok .
let' s say wonder woman falls in love with you , right ?
would it bother you if the rest of the world didn' t find her attractive ?
not at all .
cos i know they' d be wrong .
that' s what i had with rosemary !
i saw a knockout !
i don' t care what anybody else saw !
jeez , i never thought about it that way .
hey , i guess i really did screw you , huh ?
what am i gonna do ?
hey , hey , don' t panic .
we just get tony robbins back here , he puts the vulcan mind meld on ya and he puts you back under .
good idea .
in the meantime you just avoid rosemary .
why ?
because if you see the real rosemary , hypnosis is not gonna help you .
you' il need the jaws of life to get that image out of your head .
hal , open up .
it' s me .
i hear you in there .
just a sec , rosemary .
what happened to you at the restaurant ?
i got something in my eye .
i had to run back here and flush it out .
yeah , the hostess said that you seemed a little cuckoo .
so , come on , open up .
i can' t .
uh ...
let her in .
we' il club her .
no .
i' m , uh ...
i' m ...
i' m very sick .
i' ve got , uh ... um ...
cc !
you have what ?
contagious conjunctivitis .
i' il take my chances .
now open up .
all right .
in a minute .
i told you it was nasty .
are you ok ?
do you need to go to the hospital ?
nah , nah .
i got some drops .
i' il be fine .
my poor baby .
yeah .
well , i should probably rack out .
this has taken a lot out of me .
ok .
well , i' il call you in the morning and see how you' re doing .
great , great .
bye bye .
* pop the cork , a champagne glass
* raise to the future , drink to the past
* thank the lord for the friends he cast
* in the play he wrote for you
* and if you love the girl , man , light up a torch
* blaze a trail to her front porch
* kiss her till your lips are scorched
* till the rain comes down on you
* bless your sweet mistakes ...
hal , is everything all right with you ?
yeah .
yeah , it' s topnotch , sir .
why ?
well , it' s just that rosemary' s been telling me that she' s having a bit of trouble getting you on the telephone the last couple of days .
now , i wouldn' t be working you too hard , would l ?
no .
i mean , i' m working hard , but i guess i' ve just been a little preoccupied with things .
but i' il make sure and touch base with her .
right .
right .
ok , then .
i' m sorry .
apparently tony robbins is a lot tougher to track down than i thought he' d be .
i' il come through .
i promise .
i can' t keep this up , man .
calm down .
i don' t know , mauricio .
maybe i should just see her .
i mean , i do have ... you know , the heart thing .
maybe that' s enough to overcome her appearance .
it could be like in that movie the crying game .
when the guy fell in love with a beautiful woman ?
and then when he found out it was a guy , it didn' t matter , cos he already loved her .
hal , if a set of hairy boys was your biggest hurdle here , i' d say go for it .
hello ?
hey , it' s me .
hey , what' s up , rosemary ?
what happened yesterday ?
hm ?
well , i stopped by your office to say hi , but you just took off running .
oh , you' re kidding .
no .
what were you doing ?
i was jogging .
in your business suit ?
i had a sweat suit underneath .
oh .
is everything ... ?
what' s going on , hal ?
things haven' t felt the same lately .
no ?
no .
hey , rosemary , don' t worry .
everything ...
i' m just in a little funk right now , and everything' s gonna be fine .
yeah .
so , uh ...
i guess i' il talk to you tomorrow ?
bye .
bye .
* what happened to you ?
* i can t get to you
* cos there' s a wall in your heart
* that no one can get through
* and it s cold and it' s dark
* and you don t have a clue
* but this wall , it will fall
* lf it s the last thing i do
* i' il get through
* this wall in your heart
who is it ?
hal , is that you ?
it' s jill .
comin ' .
hey , what' s up ?
hey .
my girlfriend just bailed on me , and i was wondering if i could take you out to dinner .
i' m sorry .
tonight' s not good .
don' t be such a stiff .
there' s some stuff i wanna talk to you about .
no , really , i can' t .
please ?
we' il go out just as friends .
oh , come on .
you gotta eat , don' t you ?
can i ask you something , jill ?
yeah .
why the sudden thaw ?
well , i' ve ...
i' ve been thinking a lot .
hal , i ...
i made a mistake .
i never should have broken it off with you .
well , you didn' t really break it off .
we only had that one date .
besides , you did the right thing .
we didn' t have anything in common , remember ?
but that was my fault .
i shut you out emotionally .
we could have had more things in common if i' d wanted to .
mr shanahan , how are you this evening ?
how am l ?
tonight i feel like a thorn amongst a bed of roses .
your table' s ready .
john' il seat you .
right this way , please .
i' m just gonna go to the ladies ' room .
ok , rosie .
we' il be at the table .
yeah .
see , why did you shut me out in the first place ?
i' m just curious .
well , frankly , i guess i ... thought you were shallow .
me ?
yeah .
you struck me as this kind of superficial ... dickwad .
i don' t know .
what do you call it ?
hal , it' s ok .
i' ve been watching you in the past few weeks .
i' ve seen the women you' ve been out with .
and now i know appearances mean absolutely nothing to you .
if anything , you' re pathologically unshallow .
i don' t know about that .
it' s true .
listen , i have an idea .
why don' t we get all this food to go ?
why ?
because it' il taste a lot better in bed .
you know , there are a few times in a guy' s life and i mean two or three , tops when he comes to a crossroads , and he' s gotta decide .
if he goes one way , he can continue what he' s doing and be with any girl who will have him , and if he goes the other way , he gets to be with only one woman , maybe for the rest of his life .
it seems like by taking the second road , he' s missing out on a lot .
but the truth is , he gets much more in return .
he gets to be happy .
are you wearing panties ?
god !
what am i saying ?
no !
no , i' m sorry .
jill , this ... this isn' t gonna happen .
i , uh ...
i think i' m gonna go down that other road for once .
hi .
hello .
hello ?
hey , hey , hey now .
it' s me , your love bunny .
i miss you and i wanna see you .
what' s the matter ?
you sound upset .
what are you , some kind of psycho ?
hello ?
rosie ?
just you leave me daughter alone .
i don' t understand .
the jig is up , and she knows it .
well , she hasn' t returned my calls .
what' s going on ?
it' s a little late to be worrying about that now , don' t you think ?
besides , she went and accepted that peace corps assignment .
no offence , but i think i have a right to hear this from her .
i' il give you your rights .
i' il give you your last rites , you self righteous little shit !
you know , i wanted to like you .
i truly did .
and all of that malarkey that you gave me that night at the house .
i bought into it .
in spite of all me better instincts , i took the hook .
i don' t know .
maybe i share in the blame of it all .
maybe i just ...
i just wanted to believe that there was still a decent guy out there .
a lad that would be right for me daughter .
but , sir ...
don' t speak .
just you listen !
now , thankfully , as it turns out , there is a guy out there .
his name is ralph owens .
ral ...
pretty boy ralph ?
don' t be a smart ass .
now you listen to me .
they' re back together , and me daughter has a chance to be happy .
and you , you' il be respectin ' that .
* well , i dreamed i saw the knights in armour coming
* saying something about a queen
* there were peasants singin ' and drummers drummin ' ...
excuse me .
could you tell me what floor rosemary shanahan works on ?
i think she' s up in pediatrics .
yeah .
that' s third floor .
thank you .
hal , is that you ?
hey .
what are you doing here ?
i , uh ...
i , uh ... came to see rosemary .
oh .
well , she left early .
she seemed upset about something .
any idea where she went ?
you got me .
hi , hal .
hi .
um ...
how do you know my name ?
it' s me cadence .
oh , hi , cadence .
how are you , beautiful ?
how come you haven' t come back to see us ?
um ...
well , me and rosemary have been having some problems .
i , uh ...
i was really stupid .
oh .
well , why don' t you go buy her a present and then maybe you can make up ?
you were right .
huh ?
in the gym last week when you said i was scared of women , you were right .
nah , i didn' t mean that .
i was just ...
no , come on , hal .
it' s the truth .
i' m terrified of ' em .
i haven' t been close to a woman ... my whole life .
i' m a coward , all right ?
but why ?
i mean , look at you .
you' re a mountain of a man .
you got more style than mr blackwell .
you' re pulling in what 28 , 29 gs a year ?
29, 500 .
you' re the perfect catch !
i know , i know .
it' s crazy .
i just ... have this thing .
what thing ?
it' s kind of a ... birth defect ... thing .
jeez , man .
i didn' t know .
what is it ?
i have a tail .
huh ?
a tail .
what do you mean , like a story ?
no , a tail .
it' s like a waggy tail .
my backbone is longer than it' s supposed to be .
it' s like a genetic abnormality .
it' s a vestigial tail .
you do not .
yeah , i do .
get out !
if i can' t even get my best friend to accept it , how am i supposed to expect a woman to ?
wait a second .
are you for real ?
cos if you are , i gotta see this .
no , you don' t wanna see it .
no , i don' t wanna .
i gotta .
good lord !
all right , you believe me now ?
oh , man .
it really does wag .
only when i' m nervous ... or happy .
wow .
have you ever thought about , you know , maybe getting it cut off ?
cut off ?
i don' t know why i never thought of that ... when i was getting pummelled in gym class by a bunch of barking seniors !
all right , calm down , calm down .
god !
the damn thing is wrapped around an artery !
no doctor will touch it !
well ... it' s not so bad .
i guarantee you there are some girls who would think it was adorable .
like a little puppy dog .
really ?
you think it' s like a puppy dog ?
it' s cute as a button .
do you wanna ... pet the little fella ?
no !
but , you know , i' m not much of a dog person .
by the way , you' re gonna need a little sod on the fairway there .
huh ?
what do you mean ?
so , what are you doing right now ?
nothing .
why ?
can i get a lift ?
i gotta go see someone .
yeah .
sure .
* seems like longer than for ever , yeah
* my home is now a distant land
* lf i had one wish , i wish you could be
* back on that rock in the middle of the sea
* my heart is calling me to the islands
* my home is now a distant land
* lf i had one wish , i wish i could be
* back on that rock
hey !
um ...
hal , right ?
have we met ?
