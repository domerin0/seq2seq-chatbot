open your eyes
boss !
mistress kunio why are you coming now ?
we lost them
what ? !
what happened ?
they' re not average assassins
rokpa also has fallen
rokpa was beaten ?
the matchless rokpa ?
i can' t believe it
we must bring them into the spider web
are you saying we should lure them ?
if they get caught in a web loaded with poison
their bodies will become paralyzed and they won' t budge
the slightest mistake and you' il be in the same situation
mistress kunio , please throw the bait
these are the only soldiers who survived
this is too horrible
they all died trying to protect you
you know that ? !
ginkaku it' s ok
you' re right
gozue
where' s nagara ?
while fighting enemies to protect me ... ... we got split up
he' il be all right
he was the most agile of all of us
surely ...
why are you looking at me like that ?
i just ...
it' s nothing
there is a shortcut to the tokugawa temple grounds
i' il guide you
lord tenkai , please wait here for a moment
mission ...
the mission ...
it was a mistake !
we' re surrounded by enemies
what did you say ?
you bitch !
gozue
nagara ...
where' s nagara ?
the mission ...
i asked you where' s nagara ?
i killed him
what did you say ?
to the end , he only pleaded that i let you live
of course that' s a promise i can' t keep
lies
i couldn' t should you from here , could i ?
gozue
tell me that' s a lie
that' s ...
... the mission i was given
nagara is dead
to think he' d fall to someone like you
don' t follow me !
i' il deal with sanada
are you azumi ?
i sent gozue to hell already
what ?
i also lost my only companion
i' il tear you to shreds !
i' il repay you ... ... for the words you just spoke
gotcha
has the poison spread ?
you ...
how dare you ...
rokpa and gozue weren' t enough so even the black spider ?
you' ve dried up the seeds of the uenokogashu
you insolent bitch !
what a man is ...
what life is ...
even what the world is ...
you' re an inexperienced girl who knows none of these
i can' t forgive you
has the poison spread ?
this is the end
drop into hell for me
prepare yourself !
general ...
lord sanada ...
azumi
are you all right ?
azumi
get a hold of yourself
azumi
is the mission that important ?
i' m going to complete the mission
there are many people who look similar
isn' t that true ?
nachi
the mission ...
nachi
nachi
i ...
you know who i am , don' t you ?
nachi ...
nachi
it' s ok
the poison only spread a little
you have to live
azumi ...
you can' t die
kunio general
mistress kunio !
general
i couldn' t kill the assassin
what do you mean ?
how did you get these wounds ?
your dreams of war ... ... cannot end here
everything was for your sake
i only wanted to see you smile
general
kunio kunio !
ginkaku ?
ginkaku
wake up ginkaku !
why did you ...
instead of me ...
why did you die in place of me ?
why dammit , why ? !
the people i love around me ...
why do they all die ?
listen up
this is an all out attack on tenkai
move out !
and the prey comes walking up to our feet
get her !
prepare to fire !
call off the attack
general !
you must not !
get out of my way
to think such a young girl is an assassin
what reason do you have for seeking my life
it is to get rid of the war
nonsense !
yukimura
father !
gather up the troops
not only the toyotomi ... ... but now no one is on our side
this is not your place to interfere !
go back to kudo mountain
there is no hope in taking action like this
these are all the consequences of my actions
you be quiet
priest tenkai
general sanada
do you intend to face all of these soldiers
my defeat is imminent anyway
if we are to die here ... ... the tokugawa will not sit tight
if i let you live the result will be the same
it is time to make a decisive decision
that despicable girl ... ... took away what i treasured most
leave that young assassin and go
then i , sanada masayuki , will return to kudo mountain
i will not resist the tokugawa again
hhold on
you want us to leave azumi ?
no way
no way ...
i am an assassin
i am always prepared to die
all of my comrades ... ... died feeling the same
if you believe a world of peace will come ...
even if we were just used ...
even if that' s the case ...
today will be the end of everything
if i eliminate sanada
you will be hated
i willingly comply
general stop !
no one interfere father
even if you don' t interfere this is enough
i brought this all upon myself
i will get revenge for kunio
prepare yourself
father !
don' t shoot lower your guns
stand back
you wench ...
kanbei sheathe your sword
she killed every one of our most skilled warriors
and she cut the sprouts of the toyotomi
this was my father' s last wish
i want to protect what little honor remains
nobody interfere
i must get revenge for lord kato
how could i not know your rage ?
however , the promise of a warrior ... ... must be kept even at the risk of life
do you think the war has really ended ?
the mission is over
our affiliation is only up to here as well
where are you saying you must go now ?
facing what ...
