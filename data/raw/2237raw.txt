remember what it feels like to leave this place , and don' t come back no matter what .
i' m putting together a team of holy warriors .
i' m abdull ah habib .
everyone calls me bobby .
what are you doing here , bobby ?
farik doesn' t trust me ?
farik doesn' t trust anybody , except maybe osama .
my little girl' s birthday' s this sunday .
you should come .
glad you could make it .
i' m gayle .
i live next door to bobby and nadia .
darwyn .
these are text message capable .
don' t worry .
when you get the call , each of you will know what to do .
you got any idea what they' re planning ?
no .
no , my bet is the only one who knows the plan is farik , and he' s still testing me .
we got to go now .
if i take the 10 west , what could i hit ?
westwood .
37, 000 students on campus every day .
ilija ?
i hit the rose bowl approximately 90, 000 .
christian ?
i don' t pick targets .
i just destroy them .
one of us is a traitor .
no !
no !
it' s your turn .
jesus christ , man .
where the hell you been ?
i' m in .
raceman synchro : jh26 www . forom . com
any messages , nina ?
collins called .
he had to cancel lunch .
he' s hooking up with a rep from mall of america to talk about bids .
big client .
yeah , i' il say .
no problem .
more time for me to work my proposal .
oh , and tell clark that
i' il have the risk assessment for the hollywood bowl ready by the end of the day .
you got it .
brushing up on your islamic studies there , dar ?
i got these for you .
so , what happened the other night ?
that' s complicated , ray .
complicated ?
all right , well , i' il make it simpler for you .
where the fuck' s bobby habib ?
you drop out of coverage for a few hours .
you pop up again .
one of our high value targets is gone , and his entire family' s disappeared in the middle of the night .
what do you mean , his family disappeared ?
apparently that' s just what happened .
look at this .
bobby habib .
he immigrates to chicago from egypt when he' s 15 , with his mother .
now , this is less than a year after his father , who' s some colonel in the egyptian army , is executed for his participation in the assassination of president anwar sadat in 1981 .
so bobby' s in america following in his father' s footsteps .
he' s also ex u. s. army , just like you , and he serves as an nbc specialist with some artillery unit during the gulf war .
nuclear , biological , chemical warfare .
that' s right .
okay , so , where are they the wife and daughter ?
well , you tell me .
you' re the one on the inside .
and you' re the one that' s always telling me about this 24 7 surveillance
you have on these people .
yeah , these people .
not their wives and kids we don' t have resources for that .
besides , you know as well as i do these guys never involve their women in these kind of operations .
yeah , tell that to the russians and the israelis .
well , this isn' t chechnya or jerusalem .
it' s l. a.
great , ray .
you know what ?
keep thinking like that , and we' il see what you fuck up next .
you left me alone out there , man , in the middle of nowhere ... in a van full of hard core sociopaths with not even a highway patrol rookie to back me up , man .
you' re right , okay ?
for that , i apologize .
trust me when i tell you that i ripped those guys on that s. o. team a new asshole .
that will never happen again .
dar , i know you' re the one that' s out there taking all the risks .
ok , i understand that .
whatever it is that' s happening that' s complicated or that you' re struggling with , you got to realize this stuff' s gonna come out in the open .
the sooner you get out in front of it , the better it' s gonna be for you and for the case .
you understand me ?
i gotta go .
it' s farik .
good catch .
step forward .
good job , guys .
good job .
good curve ball .
show me a fastball .
go ahead .
no , don' t walk too far back .
come on .
good job .
keep your glove out .
all right .
good job , everybody .
good job .
keep going .
ruth , could you lead some baserunning drills while i take a bathroom break ?
sure , yossi .
thanks .
okay , guys .
huddle up .
high pop up , okay ?
let' s get together .
so , how' s your team ?
well , most of them are still afraid of the ball .
that' s not the team i wanted to talk about , darwyn .
i have something i want to talk to you about .
bobby' s wife and daughter you said you would take care of them .
i stopped by bobby' s place on the way over here , and they' re gone .
so , you think i would eliminate an innocent woman and her child just because her husband was a traitor ?
i don' t know exactly what to think .
you' re not supposed to think , darwyn .
you' re supposed to follow instructions .
there' s an address on there .
be there at 5 : 00 .
thomas will meet you .
what are we doing ?
recon on a potential target .
okay , but you haven' t answered my other question .
you ask too many questions , darwyn .
still , i understand , since it involves his family .
i told bobby' s lovely wife , nadia , that her husnband has left for iraq to join the insurgents .
she knew his views on the world .
i told her if she didn' t want her daughter being raised in an immigration prison , she should get on the first flight back to egypt .
i gave her money and plane tickets , of course .
are you satisfied ?
good .
don' t ever mention it again .
now , if you' il excuse me , i have to get back to my aspiring zionist ballplayers and their lovely mothers .
come on .
man , i love good jewish deli .
kosher' s the closest thing to halal .
they don' t have any middle eastern joints in this place , so , you know ?
what ?
you' re a trip , man .
look at you blond hair , blue eyed white boy talking about jewish deli and halal .
that' s why i' m the perfect weapon , man .
just another american idiot cruising the mall .
i' m harmless .
have you seen ilija and christian ?
not since earlier .
you got any idea what they' re doing ?
no .
farik likes to keep things compartmentalized .
did you get enough pictures ?
security and maintenance wear the same logo , so they must be farmed out to the same company .
security wears white shirts .
maintenance wears maroon .
black slacks shirts tucked in at all times .
how about you ?
i chatted up a few cashiers .
friday night' s the busiest .
yeah ?
the place is packed .
and not just with infidels .
that' s the danger that comes from living in dar al harb .
it' s the house of war .
it won' t always be this way , though .
before the year 630 a. d. , mecca was run by infidels .
mark my words in 50 years , every public school in america will be closed for ramadan .
you gonna answer that ?
no , it' s a ... wrong number .
how do you know it' s a wrong number if you don' t pick it up ?
just drop it , okay ?
get back !
come on , defense .
let' s go !
open !
yeah !
yeah !
so , i' il meet up with you guys at the student union ?
yeah , just , uh , make sure to shower first .
eddy .
except for when it' s behind the 3 point line , right ?
you play well .
thanks .
so , who are you ?
a friend .
your uncle dakut says hello .
he misses you .
the cause misses you ... brother eddy pangetsu .
so , you' re friends with my uncle .
have you been to jakarta ?
that' s where we met .
i helped him set up a vacation spot in sulawesi .
yes .
i remember spending summers there when i was still a teenager , while my friends from school were at sleepaway camp or the ymca .
the place is gone now washed out to sea by the tsunami .
more than 50, 000 dead .
that' s because not enough indonesian muslims practice shari' a.
you really believe that ?
i believe that god the compassionate , the merciful has created the heavens and the earth , including the sea , and he does with it as he pleases .
so , how are your studies going ?
and i mean microbiology , not basketball .
well enough .
two more years , and i' il have my doctorate .
trust me .
it' il be worth it in the long run .
well , god is not concerned only with the long run .
what matters to god is that his laws are enacted , his justice delivered .
i don' t need you to preach to me .
i' m just as dedicated to the cause as you are .
prove it .
i had someone with similar skills to your own , but he wasn' t up to the task .
and now i find myself in need .
god' s cause finds itself in need .
give me a couple days to think .
when you call your uncle to ask about me , tell him his old friend faris al farik asked you to interrupt your studies for a short time to do charity work .
he' s a very wise and very strong man .
i humbly suggest that you solicit his opinion .
so , who' s this lynne chick you' re dogging ?
ex girlfriend ?
look , man , i' m sorry , you know ?
you wouldn' t answer your damn phone .
it kept ringing , so i just looked at the caller i. d.
my mom .
lynne' s my mom .
fuck me , man .
what is it ?
someone' s following us , man .
that' s crazy , tommy .
no , man , i' m serious .
the black s. u. v. ' s been a couple cars behind me ever since we left the mall .
all right ,
let' s play it cool make sure before we do anything crazy .
all right .
okay .
watch .
we' re fucked .
it' s the cops , man !
relax .
how am i supposed to relax ? !
they' re following us !
fuckin ' relax , tommy !
all right .
okay .
just keep cruising .
make a right at the next corner .
make another right .
all right , man .
shit !
pull over .
what ?
pull over .
it doesn' t matter who they are .
they got nothing .
we haven' t done anything .
we' re not holding anything , all right ?
fuckin ' " a , " man .
that was smooth , man .
i think we make a good team .
fuck .
we gotta tell farik about this .
no .
what ?
what are you talking about ?
we lost the tail , right ?
it' s over .
if we tell farik you saw what happened to bobby , right ?
all he did was make one mistake .
you' re right , man .
it stays between you and me between us .
your car is marked , man .
you got to get rid of it , so give me the keys .
where you live ?
north hollywood .
12126 vantage , right by the 170 .
got it .
wait about an hour .
take the bus home .
call the cops and tell them you just got home .
your car is gone stolen .
nobody can prove different .
all right .
thanks , man .
thanks a lot .
all right .
how does a guy with a name like
thomas allen emerson end up living in a shit hole like this ?
you got me .
how much longer are we waiting ?
as long as it takes until he comes home .
what if he doesn' t come home ?
sooner or later , everyone comes home .
son of a bitch !
shit !
who do you think you are ? !
what the fuck is your problem ? !
you let him go right now .
you gonna shoot me ?
one way or the other , i' m dead thanks to you , right ?
are you good at your job ?
who the fuck do you think you are ?
i asked you are you good at your job ? !
fuck you .
i' il tell you how good you are , you' re so fucking good that you got made by an airhead mutt who doesn' t know his ass from a hole in the ground .
that' s right .
you' re fucking pathetic , man .
look , i know you surveillance operations guys you don' t know much about me , you don' t know much about my case .
but you' re supposed to cover me and not get me killed .
from now on , you back your sorry asses up .
fuller said you tell fuller , no more close follows .
no more active surveillance period .
you guys are supposed to know your targets ' routines well enough by now to go passive 24 7 .
remote electronics , audio , video , satellites , whatever , but no more s. o. agents 2 feet behind me looking to get i. d. ' d. now , you got that ?
can you both drive ?
that' s funny .
i' il take that as a " yes .
you' re not following this vehicle anymore .
you' re taking it in .
it' s evidence .
and get moving .
the target' s on his way home .
he should be here any minute .
thanks for coming with me to pick up marcus .
i promise you won' t be late for work .
besides , he' il be happy to see you .
no problem .
so , did you know bobby and nadia moved out ?
really ?
any idea why ?
not a clue .
i was gonna ask you .
i mean , you were with them the night before they left .
no , he never mentioned anything about moving to me .
we just , uh , we went over to his friend' s house and dealt with the leak in the plumbing .
and , uh , then he dropped me off at my place , and that' s the last i saw him .
that' s so fucking weird .
you think you know people .
marcus really liked their little girl , too .
so , when are you gonna tell me what you did time for ?
i don' t mean to make you uncomfortable .
i just think you should tell me , you know , considering .
went up on a weapons rap .
did simultaneous state and federal sentences .
i still got time on the state side , which is why i' m on parole .
you sold guns ?
no .
no .
i worked for a guy that did .
i helped transport them and customize them upgraded them , so to speak .
jesus , darwyn .
i had some money trouble , you know ?
i had to help some family out , and there were things i knew how to do from my time in the army .
these aren' t excuses , just the explanation .
that was a different time , different me .
that' s all in the past .
good .
speaking of the past , you never told me what happened to marcus ' dad .
i think i should know ' cause , uh , well , considering .
he' s dead .
i' m sorry .
don' t be .
he was a drunk .
crashed his car on the 405 , killing a couple people plus himself .
but he did keep his insurance paid up , so marcus and i have a little something to live off of for a while .
that' s something , at least .
yeah , it keeps me from having to work full time , so i can actually raise my own kid .
mommy !
hey , buddy !
how you doing ?
i got a surprise for you .
darwyn !
hey , pal .
up high .
down low .
too slow .
oh , you got me .
come on , let' s get in the car , sweetie .
hey , darwyn , want to have dinner at shakey' s tonight ?
oh , i can' t , buddy .
i gotta work .
how about tomorrow night ?
okay .
the goal is , before your mrs .
baker comes back from maternity leave , to become fluent in the various formulas for converting english measurements into metric and vice versa .
yuh , william ?
yeah .
why ?
this is america , dude .
uh , first , because that' s what it says to do in the lesson plan .
and , second , because even in england , they don' t use the english system anymore .
except for this country , it' s a metric world .
trust me , i' ve been there .
i measured things there .
i know .
for now , we keep it simple only dry to dry and wet to wet measures .
so , one pound equal to how many grams ?
uh , alexis ?
one pound is equal to 453 . 6 grams .
uh , very good , alexis .
we got to be prepared , ray .
it' s the westside galleria this friday .
you sure ?
it' s gotta be .
farik' s had all of us doing recon , and friday' s the busiest night of the week .
but i don' t know the plan .
straight explosives , chemical , biological , hostage taking .
your guess good as mine .
well , what we' il do is we' il set up a ghost team keep it real quiet .
we' il just have them watch for anything unusual .
good .
no l. a. p. d. no mall security .
anybody panics or leaks , it' il blow my cover and the case .
you dig up any more intel on farik ?
not yet , but i' m chasing down that fort benning lead .
d. o. d. hasn' t gotten back to me yet .
well , i got something else for you .
he likes to use this phrase
promote virtue and prevent vice .
now , it just happens to be the motto of the saudi arabian religious police .
you' re thinking saudi ?
any word on bobby habib ?
i gotta go .
enjoy your vacation .
i got your e mail , and i communicated with my uncle .
this agar kit' s got everything you need .
welcome to the team , brother pangetsu .
i' m sorry .
i can' t get directly involved in your operation .
what are you talking about ?
i got what you needed .
that' s all i can do for now .
i was expecting you to do a lot more .
i need an expert on the scene .
look , listen .
we' re both soldiers in the same war .
but you have your battle to fight , and i have mine .
mine' s back home in jakarta not here .
so you' re a nationalist ... and a racist .
all you care about is the country of indonesia and the people who happen to be malay maybe on a good day , polynesians , as well ?
don' t twist my words .
our ancestor is one , and our faith is one .
but for we muslims of indonesia , first and foremost , the battlefront lies in indonesia .
my family came here to gain strength , not waste it .
all right .
i guess we' il agree to disagree .
i' m truly sorry you won' t be there with us , but our spirits will be with you when you return home .
now , show me exactly how this works .
fucking whore .
now i have to beg allah for forgiveness .
oh , you don' t understand me ?
you understood me fine when i said i was going to cum on your face , remember ?
zhara ?
is that your mom again ?
she' s such a pain in the ass .
she' s a professor at berkeley , you know ?
that' s why i joined the army to piss her off .
then i had this , uh , situation near the end of basic training , and i got ... separated from service .
they booted you out ?
i knew how much she' d love it when i came crawling back home , so i didn' t come home ,
luckily for both of us ... especially her .
so , what' s the problem ?
the problem is that my brilliant mom tracked me down .
she keeps leaving messages on my cellphone about how she wants me to come home to berkeley .
now she' s threatening to come here to l. a. in person .
if she shows up , man , and starts snooping around my life ...
she could fuck everything up , dar .
if that happens ...
i' m gonna need someone to help me out with her ...
help me maintain operational security .
operational security ?
you asking me to help you off your mom , tommy ?
come on .
shit .
what' s up with the music ?
just a precaution .
you never know who might be listening .
what' s up , man , you don' t trust us ?
it' s cool , man .
it' s just part of the routine .
these are the blueprints for the mall .
nine hvac units on the roof each unit delivers air conditioning and heating to a different section of the mall .
where did you get these ?
not your concern .
this , gentlemen , is weapons grade anthrax
10 pounds .
god damn it .
what the hell' s in that suitcase ?
it' s 10 times the dosage required to deliver 100 % death .
what happened to friday ?
forget friday .
allah akbar .
ow !
this is not good .
they' re shooting themselves up with cipro .
i' m calling fuller .
hey .
no , no , no .
no fighting over the cheese .
fuller here .
tonight ?
just now ?
all right .
is everything okay ?
allah akbar .
allah akbar .
yeah !
thank you .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
oh , there' s gonna be one more .
ilija will signal us as soon as he throws the circuit breaker , killing the cameras .
each vial will be emptied into an hvac air intake vent .
we' re gonna stay focused on the job at hand .
what the hell ?
go .
watch the perimeter .
tick , tick , tick , tick ticktock , you' re on the clock time' s running out , you can' t stop
yeah ?
we' re on the roof , and it' s going down now .
the clock is running
my u. c. ' s just confirmed .
it' s not friday .
it' s tonight .
have all agents report to the rooftop and take the targets down .
kelly ? this is ray fuller here .
we got a situation that' s developing on the westside .
i need you to get your hazmat and your swat teams prepped and ready to respond .
what the fuck are you doing ?
relax , it' s harmless .
it' s called bacillus globigii .
i don' t understand .
it' s a harmless stand in .
it' s used as a biological tracer for anthrax because it' s particle size , and its dispersal characteristics are virtually identical .
it' s a fucking rehearsal ?
a run through ?
that' s right .
when we do this for real ,
i can' t afford any mistakes .
it' s fuller .
all teams , stand down immediately .
we have to feed one intake to test our delivery system , make sure we get maximum casualties .
and i have to make sure that all of you are up to the task .
i' m happy to say you passed the test .
fucking intense , man .
hey , what the fuck is going on ?
we need to get moving .
relax .
everything' s under control .
let' s get the hell out of here .
first , we do an assessment of the potential lethality .
then we get the hell out of here .
there we go .
it was a short .
here you go .
thank you .
this will determine if the bugs are viable and evenly enough dispersed in the air in large enough qualities to do damage sufficient for our purposes .
good job .
go home .
i' il be in touch .
what do you want ?
look , i' m sorry about tonight .
something came up that
yeah , just fuck off , all right ?
gayle , listen , please .
just what do you want me to say ?
i don' t want you to say anything , darwyn .
life is too short .
you know , you stand me up fine but don' t ever stand up my kid .
that was fucking close tonight , man .
they , uh ... they always told us , " when you go undercover , don' t go armed .
i wanted a weapon up on that roof tonight , ray .
i thought that was really it .
i i look ...
i know it' s been rough on you tonight .
it' s all gonna be worth it in the end .
you want to know what happened to bobby habib ?
yeah .
we drove him out to the desert ...
buried him up to his neck ...
stoned him ...
and then i put a bullet in his head .
jesus christ .
i poisoned the case , ray .
i' m sorry .
