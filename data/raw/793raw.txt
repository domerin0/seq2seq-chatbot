the photographer .
jesus , he' s just a friend .
you met him at the mint , remember ?
well , of course i am .
you don' t expect me to embarrass myself by flying commercial ?
on a budget ?
on a budget ?
who was the only person who couldn' t get in on the chinese cell phone market ?
you , with all your connections .
what was that ?
he seemed really nice .
and you know it' s hard for guys to be friends with me .
and you do this every time that i meet someone new .
and you know what ?
it' s getting really boring .
you think it' s a accident no one know about fred " bud " kelly ?
ain' t no accident .
there' s one explanation ... ... and you ladies know exactly what it is .
i' m gonna tell you what it is .
conspiracy , collusion , complicity .
that' s all it is .
let me break it down like a fraction for you about my man fred " bud " kelly .
fred " bud " kelly made skates out of whiskey bottles ... ... at his uncle' s farm in the early 1900s .
that was over there in nova scotia .
i' m gonna tell you something else .
you never seen his name on the stanley cup .
you know why that is ?
because that son of a bitch jim crow ... ... took his name off the history books .
you kind of ...
seems like every time i see you , you' re playing the race card , frank .
now , why is that ?
you can let go of my feet now .
this don' t bother you ?
of course it ******* bothers me , mate .
what the **** do you want me to do ?
well , it' s ****** up .
you can' t hear none of the lyrics .
you can' t get with the beat with all them ******* bleeps in it .
you want a ******* single on the ******* radio , it' s what you have to ******* do .
well , it' s ****** , isn' t it ?
totally ****** ! ******* right , it' s ************* .
what the **** is that ?
somebody must be in 2 .
oh , **** !
and you haven' t contacted my father about any of this ?
because , really , i don' t think there' s any reason to involve him or my mom .
it' s all on you , linus .
okay .
good .
good .
because i have a whole network ...
get out of my car .
thank you .
mr. bloom ?
yes .
there appears to be a slight problem with your card .
oh , well , yes .
here .
i' m afraid not , sir .
why ?
your business manager said you would understand .
todd said i would understand ?
no , mr. benedict .
mr. benedict .
mr ...
oh , yes .
an old friend , a practical joker .
tell mr. benedict he' s won this round , yes .
terry benedict .
old terry .
she' s looking at me from across the room .
and she' s crazy about me , i can tell ... ... because she' s been staring at me all night .
so suddenly ... ... i just go up to her , and i grab her .
and i' ve got her really close to me ... ... and her eyes are all fiery .
and my eyes are fiery .
and it' s like ...
it' s electric .
and i say to her , " mom ...
mother ...
what ?
thanks for letting me finish .
what can i say ?
you' re a funny guy .
oh , yeah .
my friend rusty .
i' m worried about him .
he owns this hotel in los angeles ... ... losing a lot of money , and he' s got no life .
he' s a nice , bright kid , but he' s beating his brains out .
do you think i could send something through you , like , a message to him ?
i read your palm , not his .
somebody who could do that could do very well .
anything on my health ?
my hips are bothering me .
please .
this ?
you couldn' t see this ?
i tried knocking , he won' t open .
i' il handle it .
i know him .
jesus christ , are you people retarded ?
it says , " do not disturb " !
it' s me .
hey .
come on in .
jeez , topher , you didn' t have to go all frankie muniz on me .
i' m sorry .
rust , look , i know this is your joint .
i just ...
there' s this girl .
i love her , man .
i love her , but she is driving me crazy !
i can' t sleep .
i can' t work .
i quit the show .
i totally phoned in that dennis quaid movie .
i mean , it' s like ...
hello ?
god , it' s almost like this kabbalah crap doesn' t even work !
rusty , call for you .
dude , don' t leave .
yeah ?
i have a message for robert charles ryan ... ... soon to be ex owner of the standard hotel .
you got him .
last time we spoke , you hung up on me .
you used some nasty words .
i got sensitive ears .
i admit i was a little emotional that evening .
think about that night a lot , don' t you ?
i thought i' d be dead before i heard the sound that killed me .
i' ve been asked to show restraint .
otherwise , you would' ve gone out ... ... to your favorite car of all the 17 you own , and as soon as you turned on the ignition ...
you got two weeks .
now , you told me that your wife said that he called it ocean' s 11 .
now , who decided that ?
i' m a private contractor .
it was a collaboration .
that moniker is insulting .
it was one job we did together .
i don' t know where this proprietary stance comes from .
it seems possessive .
one could make the argument that because it was danny' s idea ...
hang on a minute .
we all had our own areas of expertise .
i mean , without us , it don' t leave your head , mate .
it just hurts , you know , because ... ... it seemed we all agreed to call it " the benedict job .
that' s what we called it when we were doing it .
if you wanted to call it something else ... when you have a problem , who do you go to ?
rusty .
rusty .
thanks .
let' s get back on the topic .
based on what we stole , plus interest ... ... how much does everybody owe ? $17 . 34 million .
assuming benedict gives us prime plus one , which i doubt .
figure 19 to be safe .
okay , 19 each .
anybody got that ?
what , you think the stock market' s some great mystery ... ... beyond the realm of human understanding ?
didn' t you see the signs ?
i saw the signs .
how much is everybody short ?
how much you short ?
fourteen .
fourteen .
all but 5 million ?
yeah .
you gonna start with me ?
you don' t know what it' s like to create something from scratch .
well , with interest , i' m short 7 .
eight .
i spent about a million , mostly on talent development .
that makes it 7 for me .
boy , the interest just kills you .
i' m light 9 .
what' s the interest ?
about 6 .
then i owe 6 .
how ?
what ?
i' ve been staying at my parents ' .
i owe 25 .
hotels , man .
saul ?
i haven' t spent it all , but i will .
i' m out , fellas .
as ranking old timer , i gotta say , i just can' t do it .
at my age , i think i earned the right to be selfish .
i wanna thank you all for the wonderful opportunity .
you' re all aces in my book .
but i want the last check i write to bounce .
saul , you having a laugh ?
saul .
i can handle saul' s share .
you don' t have to .
who would i talk to if you were all dead ?
that' s a good point .
all right , i owe 10 .
amazing ?
yeah , but it' s a nice place .
so that comes to ... ?
ninety seven , give or take .
he didn' t find us on his own .
someone helped him .
another thief .
nobody we know would violate rule number one .
what we do know is we need a job .
we need a high paying job .
we' re too hot to work anywhere in this country .
so we go abroad .
how about we go ... ?
we' re on the 5 : 00 .
good .
where are we going ?
amsterdam .
amsterdam it is .
clock' s running .
let' s go .
never been to amsterdam .
i hear german girls are really hot .
rusty .
amsterdam ?
yeah .
don' t tell danny .
hey , rusty .
rusty .
sorry , sorry .
hey .
what are you doing ?
what' s wrong with you ?
nothing .
what ?
can i ... ?
can i ... ?
what ?
just for a second , can i talk to you ?
what' s wrong ?
i just ...
i don' t know .
this might not be the perfect time or whatever to talk about it .
okay .
i' ve been thinking .
i' ve been doing my homework .
and i' d really like ... ... to play a more central role this time around .
right .
i feel like i' ve ...
right .
i' m ready for that , and i ... way overdue .
i was wondering if i could come to the meeting and help you guys negotiate .
okay .
it' s just a sit down with matsui .
he' s got his own language , this guy .
i watched you and danny really closely last time around .
i learned a ton .
linus , in my professional opinion , you' re not ready .
okay .
yeah , i mean ...
but ...
but ...
but ... ... if you' re convinced you are ready ... ... i can speak with danny .
we can make this happen .
but you gotta be sure .
not sure ?
no , i am .
you' re sure ?
but if i had a question , i could ...
you would call me ?
right .
okay .
any time .
okay .
okay .
all right .
okay .
awesome .
thank you .
yeah .
i almost wasn' t gonna come over and say anything .
then i' d still be sleeping .
thanks , buddy .
yeah .
who' s there ?
li ...
it' s ...
what ?
it' s linus .
is rusty here ?
rusty ... ?
do you know where rusty is ?
no .
so have you met matsui ?
seriously , what do you think of me ... ... you know , in terms of just leadership potential ?
the fact that we' re unemployable shouldn' t enter your mind .
otherwise , you' re wasting time .
don' t mention benedict unless he does first .
and if he does , tell him everything .
right .
stay on point .
and don' t forget the other thing i told you .
what ?
about listening .
relax .
remember , if we don' t get this job , we' re dead .
rusty , i tried calling you all yesterday .
hey , maybe that' s why i' ve been feeling so warm recently .
yeah .
so to business ?
to business .
a doctor who specializes in skin diseases ... ... will dream he has fallen asleep in front of the television .
later , he will wake up in front of the television ... ... but not remember his dream .
would you agree ?
if all the animals along the equator were capable of flattery ... ... then thanksgiving and halloween ... ... would fall on the same date .
yeah .
hey .
when i was 4 years old ... ... i watched my mother kill a spider with a tea cozy .
years later , i realized it was not a spider .
it was my uncle harold .
oh , let the sun beat down upon my face
stars to fill my dreams
i am a traveler in both time and space
to be where i have been
is he all right ?
are we all right ?
" kashmir " ?
is that your idea of making a contribution ?
we hadn' t even started yet .
we were this close to losing that .
okay , i don' t even understand what happened in there .
what did i say ?
you called his niece a whore .
a cheap one .
she' s 7 .
confined to bed with a case of ...
no , don' t tell him about it .
i' m sorry .
okay .
so , what does this mean ?
it means you stay here .
the mark' s name is van der woude .
a semi known , wealthy recluse .
he claims to sell antiques , but hasn' t actually sold one .
his store is his privately owned home , which no one ever enters .
but don' t let van der woude' s eccentricity fool you .
the house is extremely well protected .
what are we after ?
it' s a document .
it' s a very old , very valuable document .
yeah , what is it ?
a stock certificate .
the first one ever issued from the first corporation on the planet .
dutch east india trading company .
the only one of its kind .
what' s the take ?
2 . 5 million euro .
wait .
each ?
no .
who negotiated this ?
that' s a lot of money to a lot of people .
are you out of your mind ?
if we do one job a week at that rate , we won' t pay benedict off until ...
september 2005 .
jesus christ , danny .
i hear you , but it' s what' s available .
after we pull this job off ... ... matsui' s gonna throw us another .
it' s gonna pay 10 times this one .
which will buy an extension from benedict .
you hope .
i hope .
now , the good news is that matsui gave us the system' s master code .
so , what are we waiting for ?
van der woude .
that' s the bad news .
he never leaves .
he' s agoraphobic .
he' s never been out of his house ?
not in 10 years since he moved in .
does he believe in fresh air ?
he opens his window .
what does that mean ?
best time of arrival .
means he opens his window .
every night at 1 : 30 he takes an ambien , puts on beethoven' s third .
by the fourth movement , he' s out like a light .
so we go in at 3 a . m .
okay , can we tap into the system from the phone lines ?
it' s a closed loop system with two servers locked in titanium cases next to his bed .
so hacking in is out .
look at this .
telephone repair truck , basket up to the second floor .
telescoping rod through the window , tap out the freak' s code .
dumb idea .
one lane , one way streets .
dumb idea .
all right ?
any stoppage will bring cops .
the outside is covered by five surveillance cameras .
monitored 24 hours a day by a security company .
he' s got five exterior cameras ?
this guy is a freak .
super freak .
what about through the roof ?
two more cameras , pressure sensors ...
a laser net over the trap door ...
smoke the freak out .
yeah .
smoke the freak out .
hey !
what ?
do we have to use that term ?
what term ?
" freak .
the national institute of mental health estimates 5 . 6 percent of adults ... ... develop " agraphoriaphobia .
agoraphobia .
whatever .
i' m just saying , i mean , do we ... ?
we don' t need to be an organization that labels people .
oh , now we' re an organization ?
you' d call emily dickinson a freak ?
are you hosting a telethon ?
who' s emily dickinson ?
am i the only one who feels funny about stealing from a ... ?
you know , a handicapped guy ?
well , i don' t care .
hell , yeah .
i feel funny about other things .
cool .
but ...
yeah ?
but ...
right .
what ?
ahab with a piggyback .
livingston ?
i can get anything .
it' s done .
ahab with what ?
boys .
you' re making that up .
that' s ...
that whole " ahab with a piggyback , " that' s not real ?
let me in .
how do you think it feels ... ... when someone bangs on the door ?
i gotta go to the toilet .
otherwise , i' m gonna shit on your feet .
come on .
show me them specs .
i' ve been doing this since i' m 12 years old .
you' re micromanaging .
you gotta find people you can delegate to .
otherwise , you' il never have a life .
i don' t want a life .
i want the hotel to run like a hotel should .
reuben .
yeah .
great .
okay .
good .
maybe .
fantastic .
remember in miller' s crossing where turturro begs for his life ?
sure .
look into your heart .
i cry every time .
what ?
we have no line of sight .
our only possibility , the window .
we' re three inches too high .
there' s no clear shot , even with basher .
in the physical universe we occupy , it cannot be done .
what about the guy from the bulgari job ?
nagel .
spoke with him .
anything ?
lot of ideas , none of them any good .
he' s pushing this new holographic technology .
really interesting stuff , though .
he can reproduce anything 3 d.
how about 97 million ?
we' re forcing it .
yeah , we' re forcing it .
you know what we haven' t thought of ?
what ?
we turn ourselves in .
what could benedict do to us then ?
there you go .
call the cops , tell them we did the bellagio job .
they put us away for 20 years .
that' d teach him .
i think tess would stick around .
you look great in jumpsuits .
hey ... ... how' s the hotel business ?
sucks .
how' s east haven ?
sucks .
i don' t know .
can' t turn my brain off , you know .
it' s me .
we go into some place , and all i can do is see the angles .
it' s what i do .
it' s what i' ve always done .
i love it .
i don' t know .
some sort of weird irony , you know ?
tess watching me scratch and itch .
hey , listen .
you know , the world' s gone nuts and you' re ...
what' d you wanna do ?
it' s not attached to the adjacent buildings .
the whole house ?
we' re just raising it slightly .
schumann did it in ' 64 in venice and ' 73 in istanbul .
he only had a crew of six .
we can' t tilt a house .
did it with the leaning tower of pizza .
exactly , thank you .
it took 300 men over two years to do it .
there' s 30 pylons .
we cut them , insert the jacks and crank away .
it' s really our best plan , considering it' s our only plan .
crank for how long ?
like i said , it' s our only plan .
what ?
oh , oh , okay , hold on .
try that .
number five .
i' m a go .
master thieves who practice the long con live separate lives as civilians .
they have legitimate jobs and families ... ... which make them extremely difficult to catch .
the greatest thief of all time was , without question ... ... gaspar lemarc , who either died in portugal in 1988 ... ... or in hong kong in 1996 , or he' s still alive .
we may never know for certain , because lemarc ... ... was never captured or photographed ... ... despite being active for over 50 years .
the thief we know only as the night fox .
so named for the small onyx figurines he leaves behind to taunt us ... ... the night fox must be considered our number one priority .
his string of high profile crimes are an embarrassment to our branch ... ... to our entire profession .
we need more than traditional resources to pursue thieves like the night fox .
we need to train ourselves to think the way they think , to see what they see .
and we should not allow ourselves to be distracted ...
i' m sorry .
someone just robbed the van der woude house .
what ?
hi , isabel .
well , we could really use your help on this one .
i hope the scene hasn' t been contaminated .
when can i speak to mr. van der woude ?
probably tomorrow .
he' s heavily sedated .
we can' t figure out how they disabled the alarm .
shorted it out somehow ?
no , that would have triggered the system and damaged the circuits .
well , then .
then i don' t know how they got in .
they had the code .
someone other than the owner must have known it .
impossible .
van der woude programmed the last nine steps of the system .
he set it and never left the house again .
closed loop .
redundant servers .
titanium encasement .
it' s not bad , actually .
yeah .
thanks .
do we know each other ?
i think i saw you yesterday .
oh , yeah ?
yeah , you were being chased by the police .
chasing me ?
no .
i don' t think so .
i' m quite sure it was you .
doesn' t say much for the police .
no , i love rome .
i love it .
but there' s an opening at work the level above me , and it' s ...
i was thinking i was gonna try out for it .
it' s in amsterdam .
my mother has family there , so it' d be ...
it' d be good .
he lifted the whole house ?
the whole house .
the entire house ?
the entire house .
it' s called a schumann special ... ... named after this guy , a brilliant guy , max schumann .
then he did it in istanbul in 1973 .
what is it ?
it' s where the crossbow bolt hit .
the crossbow bolt ?
they fired from that rooftop through this open window .
with a crossbow bolt from that roof through that window ?
that' s a very difficult shot .
no , it is an impossible shot ... ... until they raised the building .
check the pylons .
they' il be elevated .
you know the name max schumann ?
no .
well , they do .
who ?
the americans .
wait a minute .
exactly .
why would they bring the drill if they weren' t planning to use it ?
what ?
oh , god .
what ?
i don' t know .
congratulations .
you are the second person to crack the van der woude safe tonight .
in arriving second , mr. ocean , you have joined a long line ... ... of people who' ve worked hard and risked a great deal only to get somewhere second .
you don' t know these people by name , of course , because they enter oblivion .
you know this word , " oblivion " ?
it means to be totally forgotten by everyone forever .
and it' s where you would be now if it weren' t for the bellagio heist .
how does this guy know who we are ?
in a way , i' m responsible for you coming to amsterdam in the first place .
i hired matsui , and matsui hired you .
that' s the guy who dimed us to benedict .
all of them , including ocean .
yes .
i find that hard to believe .
and you are ?
you can call me the night fox .
the night fox .
okay , mr. night fox .
what will this information cost me ?
don' t worry .
nothing .
nothing ?
who do you think you' re dealing with ?
nothing costs nothing .
and this information is definitely worth something .
let' s just say our interests are temporarily aligned .
how so ?
well , the information is free , but it comes with certain conditions .
such as ?
restraint on your part .
restraint ?
that' s asking a lot .
what else ?
two weeks to buy themselves out of trouble .
two weeks ?
i can live with that , even if they can' t .
just out of curiosity , what will you make them pay ?
for letting them live ?
everything they stole , plus interest .
a lot of interest .
but didn' t your insurance cover what was stolen ?
of course .
so you' re asking them to double your money ?
well , do you really think that' s fair ?
fair ?
i certainly hope not .
so , what about the information ?
okay .
it' s on your desk .
he was here .
around 3 : 30 this morning .
i can tell .
who ?
the night fox .
go down to the dampkring and pick up a guy called matsui .
real name , lan nicolas mcnally .
the night fox was here at the same time as the americans ?
why ?
that' s what we' re gonna find out .
what is he doing ?
get him out of there .
god .
hello , frank .
i can' t understand what we did to this guy .
why does he have it out for us like this ?
how did he get that code ?
doesn' t matter .
he broke rule number one .
he' s on the list .
great time for a turf war .
i spoke with frank' s associate in dublin .
she' s trying to get us a name on this guy .
our train leaves tomorrow at 1 : 38 , okay ?
where is frank ?
i don' t know .
it' s gonna get out .
then we' il be dead , and no one will wanna work with us .
housekeeping .
turndown service for mr. ryan .
hi .
nice room .
you have it all to yourself ?
you here to take me in ?
why would i do that ?
it' s not as if you stole something .
it' s nice to see you again , robert .
you too .
of course , you' ve been seeing plenty of me , haven' t you ?
i like this one .
i call it " thief la mode .
schumann special , huh ?
i guess that' s what i get for opening my mouth .
so , what about the night fox ?
did he leave you a message ?
what about the figurine ?
you still have it ?
i suppose it' s a compliment in a way .
i guess he' s threatened by you , though i can' t imagine why .
you have no idea what you' re up against .
the french police think he' s better than lemarc .
well , he is french .
let me give you some advice .
find out how you offended him .
apologize .
beg for mercy .
got to go .
any message for frank ?
he' s been hanging around the station .
on what charge ?
well , we found a print of a size 14 hi tec magnum boot at the crime scene .
and ?
bought with a fraudulent credit card .
from that point on , well , there' s only one , maybe two great nail salons in amsterdam .
and you lied to us .
yeah , and to me .
well , frank knew .
frank knew you were in touch ?
i wasn' t in touch .
i was more like keeping tabs .
she' s a cop !
detective , actually .
where' d she learn all that schumann crap ?
dad .
what , he was a cop ?
thief .
oh , god .
was he good ?
oh , yeah .
great .
pissed off ex girlfriend whose thief father ... ... taught her every trick in the book .
well , she just made danny and yen .
in the next 48 hours , your pictures will be in every police station .
nobody looks at them .
nobody but cops .
detectives .
you' d think she' d have sympathy for us ... ... if her old man was a thief .
is that sympathy or empathy ?
no , her old man got popped a day before her 9th birthday .
died in jail .
so i wouldn' t count on much sympathy .
or empathy .
she' s gonna have the hotel under surveillance .
great .
we' il just eat room service , watch movies and wait for benedict to kill us .
who' s on the $100 bill ?
adams .
john travolta .
he said every problem ... ... is an opportunity in disguise .
he couldn' t say that with a . 45 in his mouth .
no , you' re missing the silver lining here .
now , she gave us a name , didn' t she ?
the night fox .
one phone call , we' re gonna find out everything there is to know about this guy .
the name is m. diaz .
d l a z.
it' s a black duffel bag .
the team' s in rotterdam .
the bag' s in brussels .
disconnected , frightened ... ... paranoid , but with good reason .
it' s too sad to be funny .
unusable .
i think i can get 20 minutes out of it .
great .
i got it .
the team' s in barcelona .
the bag' s in madrid .
this is a moral issue we' re dealing with here .
and we don' t have a grease man anymore , because he' s in a bag somewhere .
we got a bag man .
such an ape .
an animal with no feelings .
i have feelings .
no , you don' t .
i feel bad for the guy .
he' s in a piece of luggage , but he' s got water .
what did you want them to do ?
get off the bus .
and pick up the bag with our friend in it .
how many pro soccer teams are fielding 50 year old men ?
rusty' s not 50 years old .
yeah , dude , we know rusty' s not 50 .
you think i' m 50 years old ?
let me ask you something .
no , wait , let me ask you something .
how old do you think i am ?
forty eight .
you think i' m 48 years old ?
fifty two ?
maybe he should' ve asked me .
nobody should ever ask you anything .
that guy doesn' t have a hard enough life right now ?
you gotta ...
you' re gonna defend him ?
they put yen in a handbag .
can i ask you something ?
ever notice ... ?
yes .
okay , can i ask ... ?
yes .
you ever notice that tess looks exactly ... ?
don' t ever ask that .
seriously .
not to anyone .
especially not to her .
wait .
why not ?
look .
it' s not in my nature to be mysterious ... ... but i can' t talk about it , and i can' t talk about why .
can i ask you ... ?
do i look 50 to you ?
yeah .
really ?
well , i mean , only from the neck up .
saul ?
what' s the matter ?
nothing .
you wanna go out ?
it' s nice .
no .
you wanna watch something ?
the game' s on .
no .
you hungry ?
i' il heat something up .
no .
saul , ever since you got back , you' ve been acting strange .
what did danny want ?
nothing .
nothing ?
how could he want nothing ?
all right , the night fox has a name .
franois toulour .
baron franois toulour .
father was a french industrialist , mother was italian nobility .
he never met her , but he inherited her title .
the bad news is he' s rich , he' s bored and he' s talented .
the really bad news is he was trained by lemarc .
this is not good .
with the lemarc ?
gaspar lemarc ?
that' s the one .
well , we' re doomed .
we' re not doomed .
he' s one guy , and he' s french .
yeah .
before we get too impressed by his background ... ... let' s hear what he' s done .
he started in the ' 90s .
bank of geneva , the danish treasury , the bank of italy , amc amro ... ... the brussels diamond exchange , antwerp diamond exchange .
wait , wait .
all those in the 1990s ?
i' m only up to ' 96 .
seriously ?
in ' 97 , he went through an art phase .
he hit the tate in london , the louvre in paris , twice , and the prado .
wait .
no , no , hang on .
the prado museum in ' 97 ?
that was moretti .
everybody knows that ...
he is moretti .
it' s one of his aliases .
okay , i' il skip to my favorite .
in 2002 , he stole the king of morocco' s 200 foot yacht .
vanished into thin air .
crew surfaced days later in a life raft .
couldn' t remember a thing .
how do you hide a 200 foot yacht ?
lf the king knows , he' s not telling .
he got it back a month later .
he now plays tennis with toulour every weekend .
we' re in some serious trouble here .
copy that .
so , what do we do ?
we respond .
respond ?
how ?
in kind .
mr. ocean .
you broke rule number one , and that has consequences .
oh , you must be talking about the paintings .
don' t worry .
you' il be dead in five days , and i' il get my paintings back .
unless you have an accident first .
i don' t think so , daniel .
perhaps i should explain to you why i' m tormenting you .
i' d like that .
last month i was in portugal to see my mentor .
lemarc .
indeed .
a very loud and annoying american businessman was there the same day .
he worked for a big insurance company .
he' s the one who suggested benedict to you as a potential mark .
you know the man ?
what about him ?
he said it was the most beautiful job he' d ever seen .
he went on and on about this job , and then he said ... ... it showed you were the greatest thief in the world .
but the worst part is that lemarc never corrected him .
i told lemarc that you can' t be better than me .
and he answered that it was impossible to know for sure .
so i thought about that for , like , three weeks in a row , day and night .
and then suddenly , i realized that he was actually right .
it is impossible to compare one theft to the other .
so i guess the only way to know who' s the best of us for sure ... ... is to go after the same object .
do the same job .
don' t you think that would be fun ?
you' re being awfully cavalier with a lot of people' s lives so you can play out a game .
you' re gonna regret it .
come on , mr. ocean .
how are you gonna possibly get $97 million by next wednesday ?
especially if every safe you crack between now and then is already empty ?
whereas if you accept my challenge and win ... ... i promise i' il pay your debt to benedict ... ... and lemarc will hold my money in escrow as a guarantee .
what are we stealing ?
the famous faberg coronation egg .
was that your idea or lemarc' s ?
i think he would agree ... ... that it' s the most appropriate thing for us to compete over .
where is it located ?
the egg left paris this morning on its way to rome .
it travels with heavy security and usually with one or more replicas .
sometimes they even show the replicas without anybody knowing .
when the egg goes on display monday morning ... ... you' il have 48 hours to steal it before your deadline' s up .
when the deadline passes and you don' t have the egg ... ...
lemarc will know who' s the best .
rusty' s phone .
who is this ?
nicole .
who' s this ?
nagel .
where' s rusty ?
he said if you called , to say he was at gunther' s .
gunther' s ?
what' s that about ?
did he say something ?
do you have a message ?
yes , i do .
tell him this thing is gonna cost him double what i told him .
and tell him i had to go three times as thin on the layers .
and tell him if he wants it tomorrow , it should cost him more than double .
and tell him this thing is beautiful .
would fool the bloody romanovs themselves .
and tell him i' m being a nice guy .
and tell him he dresses like a gigolo .
is that it ?
yeah .
no .
tell him having a sexy female assistant ... ... is such a terrible clich .
can i get a coffee or something ?
thanks .
just a cappuccino or espresso .
well ...
you call me on saturday and ask me to come into my office ... ... and sign a 1077 ... ... and you can' t even tell me what they are after ?
i can come to your house .
i' m leaving for naples in two hours .
we' il talk about this on wednesday .
it' il be gone by wednesday .
what ?
what ?
what will be gone ?
something worth signing a 1077 for .
ryan and his friends did the bellagio casino heist in 2001 .
i am telling you , this is serious ...
lf that' s true ... ... then we should call the american fbl ...
no , no , no .
maurizio , listen to me .
agent lahiri ... ... a 1077 is not a small thing .
unless you can tell me what they are after , there is no point in discussing it .
hey ...
because lemarc stole it in 1980 when 23 others failed .
because the night fox is trying to prove he' s better than ryan and his friends .
this is ridiculous .
you say the egg will be stolen .
then you say lemarc already stole it 24 years ago .
which one is it ?
both .
what ?
lemarc' s wife made him put the egg back .
when i signed a 1077 for you on the bulgari case ... ... you requisitioned 30 of my men for three months and made zero arrests .
i won' t do it again .
first , we cannot go at night .
the laser grid in the great hall' s impossible to beat .
nothing' s impossible .
this is impossible .
it' s in constant motion , programmed to improvise randomly ... ... meaning we can' t plan our way through .
all right .
so it' s a daytime play .
we' re still short three on the inside since isabel made you and yen and danny .
we could try a smuggler' s paradise .
it hasn' t worked since the ' 50s .
' 54 , actually .
what' s option two ?
baby jane , squeaky wheel , followed by a number two son .
it' s complicated , but it' s got a high success rate .
the only problem is ...
we can' t do it without a grease man on the inside , without yen .
we' il have to risk it .
we' il put him in disguise .
10 : 10 , i leave the caf , proceed west .
10 : 11 ?
i enter the second floor bathroom .
10 : 13 ?
approach the spanish steps from the south .
basher and i enter by the main entrance .
10 : 15 ?
i help yen into the ventilation duct .
10 : 18 ?
i move reuben to the egg room .
i pause in the great hall while ...
i go to the egg room .
10 : 21 ?
yen enters the mainframe room .
he cuts power to grid 14 a.
he radios me .
i signal linus .
i then go to the egg room .
10 : 22 ?
i drop my keys and move reuben to his mark .
i blind camera one .
i blind camera two .
i blind camera three .
camera four .
i make the switch .
right .
10 : 24 ?
i pull to the corner of the main entrance .
i meet danny at the steps .
we head north .
10 : 25 ?
turk and i make the drop .
all right .
really good stuff , guys .
really good work .
all right , we' il pick it up here in an hour .
it' s a slam dunk .
great .
10 : 45 , we all get arrested .
you bet .
how was toulour ?
he was predictable .
you hear from nagel ?
he' il be here .
that' s a lot to presume from a guy like nagel .
follow it up .
this is isabel .
it' s johan .
i just set a 6 : 00 meeting for you with an andre ciment ... ... who says he had four paintings stolen from his house in lake como .
and when was this ?
sometime friday .
he' s missing two monets , a turner and a degas .
which degas was it ?
blue dancers .
supposedly , there' s surveillance video , but i haven' t been able to confirm that yet .
it is all about error correction .
three thousand separate , translucent , digital slivers ... ... instead of the 1000 i thought it would be .
thank god it doesn' t have to move .
re creating the lighting was a pain .
it' s a mixture of tungsten and real light .
