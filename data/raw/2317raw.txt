we were just making sure there was adequate closet space .
good .
well , this house is yours if you want it ... but you have to decide right now .
we' il take it .
really ?
oh , my god !
you know what i kept thinking when we were looking at that house ?
that we should get a mattress for that closet .
i kept thinking that it felt like a dream come true .
come here .

really fast .
let' s see .
okay .

911 , there' s been an accident .
yes .
you okay ?
you didn' t see it , did you ?
seewhat ?
what did you see ?
i didn' t see anything .
john .
there' s something wrong with me .
it' s called a glioblastoma .
it' s a temporal lobe tumor .
according to the doctor , it' s extremely rare .
600, 000 gets this thing .
did they say it was a result ofthe accident ?
no , it turns out ... that it' s been there a while .
there' s nothing else they can do ?
no , no .
they did the surgery , and they couldn' t get it all out , so they' il ... keep her on the chemo ... as long as her strength holds out .
that' s working .
i think she' s looking better now .
good .
that' s good .
two weeks ago ... we were house hunting .
one day you' re just driving along in your car and the universe ... just points at you and says ...
ah , there you are , a happy couple .
i' ve been looking for you .
i' ve been looking for you " .
i' m sorry .
for what ?
for all of this .
i feel like i ruined everything .
you didn' t ruin anything .
not a damn thing .
i want you to be happy .
you didn' tsee it , did you ?
yes .
yeah ?
she knew .
what ?
she was drawing angels .
two years later .
it was the meanness of the campaigns ... the almost complete lack of candor and honesty ... that turned the voters off ..
i think that these parties are demonizing each other .
they' re projecting our own personal fears and anxieties ... onto the national stage .
people don' t like it .
people are very , very unsatisfied at the moment .
it makes them complacent because they don' t see any possibility of change .
2004 ...
is there a dark horse candidate out there for the democrats ?
well , i' m hearing a lot about russ mccallum .
governor of virginia .
yeah , he might do what carter ...
hey , i told her to watch .
who ?
peter' s friend gwen .
she' il be there tonight .
oh , god .
look , i don' t think i' m gonna be able to make that one tonight .
come on , you can' t keep blowing this thing off .
i' m not .
i' ve got an interview with the governor .
i gotta be in richmond at 8 : 00 in the morning .
i almost forgot .
mccallum' s office called .
they bumped the meeting till tomorrow night .
eddie , look , i ... she' s not mary .
not by a mile .
but you know what ?
no one everwill be .
hey , ed .
i' m sorry about today .
i' m sure gwen is very nice .
maybe some other time .
it' s about 1 : 00 in the morning .
i' m a little wired , so i' m driving down to richmond tonight .
i' il talk to you tomorrow .
bye .
hi .
i' m sorry .
i know it' s really late , but my car broke down just up the road .
i wondered if i could use the phone .
hello .
it' s him .
i been waitin ' for you .
you son of a & $ % # @ .
what are you doin ' ?
get the door !
get the door !
just stay right there .
mister , i don' t know who you ...
shut up !
honey ...
connie' s here .
well , hey , gordon .
how you doin ' ?
okay , why don' t you just ... put down the gun and tell me what' s going on here .
yeah .
he' s come around three nights in a row .
this son of a bitch is stalking us .
i' m john klein .
my car broke down ...
let' s let gordon finish , mr. klein .
two nights ago ... at 2 : 30 in the a . m . there' s a bang on the door .
i open it up , and here' s this guy .
he says he wants to use the phone .
but there' s something creepy about him ... so i tell him to get lost .
last night at 2 : 30 on the dot , guess who' s back .
you' re sure it was mr. klein here ?
i am absolutely positive . it' s mr. klein .
crazy .
this is ...
i am not crazy .
i didn' t say that you ...
so then what happened ?
i warned him off my property .
i used the word " trespass " , and he still came back .
you' re lucky i' m a christian , because i had the right to shoot you on my porch .
he' d have to been inside the house , gordon .
what ?
fine .
so tonight i figured the dumb & % $ # might come back , and sure enough , there he is .
its imposible .
it wasn' t me .
i don' t know what' s happening here .
something' s very wrong here .
i don' t know these people .
i have never been here before .
i' m from dc .
look .
it' s a wallet , okay ?
wallet ?
i' m from dc .
my name is john klein .
washington post ?
yes .
yes .
can i get out of this shower now ?
you can wait for me outside , mr. klein .
we' il run a check on him .
anyone else comes by , forget the gun .
just call me .
just find out what he wants .
so , you didn' t actually see the guy before tonight ?
no .
but i heard the knocking .
three nights in a row .
i' il talk to you tomorrow .
i' m gonna give you a ride into town , unless you wanna sleep in your car .
i can call for a tow in the morning .
you' re a long way from dc .
what are you doing here ?
driving through .
we' re not on the way to anyplace , mr. klein .
i recognize you .
dc review .
you watch that ?
we' re not all bumpkins .
so i' m not under arrest ?
you didn' t steal anything .
you didn' t hurt anybody .
no breaking and entering .
you' ve had trouble with him before ?
gordy and denise ?
no .
they' re good people .
things have just been a little strange around here lately .
you still haven' t told me what you' re doing here in the middle of the night .
i don' t know .
where am i ?
think you could show me where we are on the map here ?
we' re right on the state line .
with ohio .
what time did you leave dc ?
1 : 00 in the morning .
if i was doing 80 the whole way , it would' ve taken me six hours to get here .
there' s gotta be a logical explanation .
i don' t know .
by the way , don' t worry about your pal the governor .
i' il take care of it .
yeah .
okay .
thanks , eddie .
so ?
it' s running fine , mr. klein .
can' t find a thing wrong with her .
really ?
strange .
all right , what do i owe you ?
nothin .
i said i can' t find anything wrong with her .
mr. smallwood .
mr. smallwood ...
i just wanted to apologize for that misunderstanding we had last night .
are you sure it was me that came by the last couple of nights ?
listen , mister .
connie called me .
she told me that you check out , and that' s good enough for me .
i' m perfectly willing to let it go .
but i don' t drink anymore ... and i don' t lie .
and as far as i know , i' m not crazy .
so if you' re accusing me ...
look , here' s the thing .
i don' t know how i ended up here last night .
i didn' t even know i was in west virginia .
some how , between 1 : 00 and 2 : 30 ...
i traveled 400 miles and ended up on that road by your house ... and i' ve got no memory of it .
and you call me crazy ?
i was afraid i' d see you here .
okay .
you didn' t show up .
too bad .
i really wanted to know what i look like .
sergeant , i' m curious .
last night you said ... things had been strange ... around here lately .
what kind of things ?
you really don' t want to know .
now i really need to know .
just your odd reports .
people seeing things they can' t explain , so they all come to me .
' cause you' re the cop .
because they know me .
you know , if there are other people in this town ... who are feeling as ... confused as i am right now ...
i' d sure like to hear it .
the past few months , people have been coming up to me ... and reporting that they' ve been seeing strange things .
i don' t mean the town speed freak .
i mean good , honest , church going people .
i' ve known these folks my entire life ... and they seem down right embarrassed to be bringing it up .
bringing what up ?
it' s hard to explain .
weird lights .
strange phone calls , you .
i heard a crack ...
a very strange sensation .
reds eyes .
as a moth " .
lights and calls phone strange .
you .
seeing a ufo is one thing .
what do you do when someone tells you they saw this in their backyard ?
what is it ?
my wife died two years ago .
she saw something .
drew pictures .
who showed you this ?
it was right here .
there was only a foot or so
between its head and that branch .
that makes it about ... eight feet tall .
yeah .
i was getting ready for bed and just .
happened to glance out the window .
at first all i could see ... were these two red eyes .
i kept looking at it .
i couldn' t stop .
i' ve never had that feeling before , like i couldn' t move .
and then i guess itjust ... took off ..
that may not make much sense , but it' s ... the only way i can put it into words .
you didn' t see it , did you ?
it started about two months ago .
every time i answered the phone i' d hear it .
the first one was just a loud beeping noise .
now they' re mostly .
these creaking , howling sounds .
they all like this ?
well , once it was a man talking really fast .
what' d he say ?
i couldn' t make it out .
some foreign language .
have you had the line checked ?
i even had our number changed .
but before i got a chance to give it out to anyone ... the calls started again .
it' s not a question of believing them .
like i said , they' re honest people .
how long you lived here ?
my whole life .
i grew up right over that hill .
on a farm ?
shucks , no .
a real live house .
indoor plumbing and everything .
sorry .
we even had shoes for church and schoolin ' and stuff .
all right , all right .
where the hell are you ?
i' m still here .
west virginia ?
yeah .
yeah .
something' s come up .
you' re kidding .
something of national interest in west virginia ?
no , scientific .
i' il tell you about it later .
cy' s beginning to look rabid .
keep him at bay , okay ?
are you okay ?
you sounda little stressed .
no , i' m fine .
i' il talk to you later .
we were parked up here ... and sort a making out in the back seat .
and what happened next ... is sort of hard to explain .
next day , i woke up and ... both my ... my eyes were swelled up .
what did the doctors say ?
he couldn' t explain it .
see this one here ?
it ain' t never healed .
we' re getting engaged .
that' s good .
yes , talk me ?
talk me ?
i gotta talk to you .
okay .
mr. klein .
hello .
i want to speak with you .
ok .
last night i woke up ... with the worst headache
i' ve ever had in my life .
i went into the bathroom .
to get some aspirin ... and i happened .
to look in the mirror ... and ...
i swear to god ...
i see something ...
i can' t describe .
but it sure as hell ... is not my reflection .
and then ...
i hear ... this weird ... howl ... coming out of the sink .
and there' s a voice .
it' s a voice ... and it' s saying ...
do not be afraid .
ninety nine will die .
denver nine " .
i even wrote it down .
he just keeps saying the same thing over and over for an hour ... and then it stops .
and when i wake up this morning i look at this piece of paper ... } where i wrote down the words ... and this thing is on it .
i did not draw that .
denver 9 .
99 they will die .
gordon ?
what ?
gordon , you ... your ear' s bleeding .
this cat scan is clean , gordon .
no sign of any physical problem .
are you sure ?
because this man' s wife had a tumor .
what you had , gordon , was a first class migraine .
i can write you a prescription .
that' d be good .
thank you , doctor .
there were other symptoms , doc .
he had hallucinations , heard voices .
aren' t they both associated with glioblastoma ?
i see nothing here to suggest ... something as exotic as glioblastoma , mr. klein ... but if you' d like i can refer mr. smallwood to another neurologist ... for a second opinion .
he' s wrong .
no , that' d be fine .
thank you very much .
gordon !
wait .
wait .
he' s not wrong .
nothing' s wrong .
nothing' s wrong .
he' s not wrong ' cause there' s nothing wrong .
there' s nothing wrong .
you go to a doctor with a bleeding ear . and he tells you you got a headache ...
yes , well , you' re not sick , so that is good news .
i wish i was sick .
then i would know why this is happening .
you shouldn' t say things like that .
you should not say that .
what should i say , denise ?
i' m hallucinating .
i' m hearing voices .
was your wife hearing voices before she had her tumor ?
no .
13 news is headed to the scene , and we' il have a live report in minutes .
again our top story , domain air .
flight 9 out of denver has crashed .
an airline representative is expected to make a statement shortly .
there is no confirmation ... but all 99 passengers and crew members are believed dead .
wow , man .
could i speak to alexander leek , please ?
this is leek .
mr. leek , this is john klein .
i' m working on a pretty strange story .
i was hoping you might be able to help me out .
i' m particularly interested in your theories on precognition and prophecies .
anything you want to know is in the book .
yeah , but the ... chapter that you have . on the entities you call ...
were you contacted ... or are you pretending to have a professional interest ?
yeah ...
no .
i' m a reporter for the washington post .
well , i' m sorry , mr. klein .
i don' t work in those areas anymore .
i don' t understand .
to hear a voice is one thing ... but this isn' t just a message , it' s a prediction .
it came true .
these things gordon' s having , are they dreams or hallucinations ?
the way he describes them , they sound like dreams .
i don' t know .
he believes they' re real .
i had a dream like that .
yeah ?
it was nighttime ... and i was in the middle of the ocean .
i was trying to swim , but i was too cold .
i kept looking ...
i kept looking for something ... to hang on to .
and there were presents ... floating all around me .
they were wrapped up .
they were tied with bows .
i tried to grab on to them , but they kept popping away .
and then i started to sink ...
like a stone .
there was nothing i could do .
i was falling .
but it felt good .
i was letting go .
i was letting myself go and ... all i could see ... was black ... and all i could feel . was the darkness above me and the lights ... coming from below .
i knew i was dying .
and then
i heard this voice .
like somebody whispering in my ear .
wake up , number 37 " .
wake up
and then i woke up .
what do you think that means ?
number 37 ?
i have absolutely no idea .
i met him .
the guy who told me about the plane crash .
you met him ?
yeah .
i met him .
last night , coming home from work about midnight .
i' m driving past the cement plant ... out bythe chemical factory .
right .
something happened .
bright ...
lightning .
something encircles me .
everything' s kind ofhot .
i feel like i can' t catch ... catch my breath .
he looked human .
but there was just something ... wrong about him .
that' s when i heard the voice .
the same voice that i heard two nights ago .
he said ...
do not be afraid .
my name ... is indrid
cold " .
and he said to me ...
in a place this size .
equator .
three hundred .
three hundred will die .
wait for me .
i will return .
i will see you in time " .
and that was it .
gordon , all that ...
it' s a iittle ...
have a look .
earthquake in ecuator .
more than three hundred deads .
she knew .
i didn' t see anything .
you want to hear the chief' s latest phone call ?
yes , sure .
$ % & #
yes ?
thank god you' re there .
gordon ?
i know i sounded crazy the other day , but things are getting weird out here .
slow down , gordon .
he' s here .
who' s here ?
indrid cold .
he' s standing right next to me .
get over to gordon' s right away .
he says indrid cold is there .
gordon ?
let me talk to him .
sure .
hang on .
hello , john klein .
who is this ?
my name is indrid cold .
unless , of course , you' re gordon smallwood .
your father was born in racine , wisconsin .
he lived in a green house on monroe street .
you don' t remember how your mother looked .
okay you got my attention .
where' s my watch ?
in your shoe .
under the bed .
very good , john .
thank you .
what' s in my hand ?
chap stick .
you' re reading my mind , aren' t you ?
did you read my mind ?
i have no need to , do i ?
what' s the third line of page 51 ?
a broken smile beneath her whispered wings " .
still more proof , john klein ?
what do you look like ?
it depends on who' s looking .
i want to meet you .
you already have , john .
i have seen you afraid .
you' re afraid right now , aren' t you ?
can ... can i ask you something ?
why ask me what you already know , john ?
when ?
why ?
what happened to my wife ?
you were there .
mary klein cannot be found by looking .
you will see her in time .
gordon !
what' s up , connie ?
everything okay ?
did you just call john ?
no .
i' ve been asleep since 9 : 00 .
unless , of course , you' re gordon smallwood .
see ?
it' s sticking up here around 1, 950 cycles per second .
but it never gets any lower than maybe 1, 930 or so .
but yours is way down here in the normal vocal range ... anywhere between 1, 000 and 1, 200 cycles per second .
okay , so this guy' s vocal range . is much higher than mine .
what makes you think it' s a man ?
still more proof , john klein ?
he was not the looked for element .
what is it ?
near as i can tell , it' s ... an electrical impulse .
but whatever it is , it' s not coming from human vocal cords .
why ask me what you already know , john ?
what happened to my wife ?
you were there .
mary klein cannot be found by looking .
you will see her in time .
the capacity to see the future .
it is not characteristic of you , john
this isn' t like you .
we used to rip on this stuff . when it came over the wire .
yeah , i know .
it' s different when it happens to you .
do me a favor . talk to cyrus today .
tell him you got the flu .
any excuse .
