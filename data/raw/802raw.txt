it' s five days before christmas .
i' m in the middle of a new york department store .
he' s asking me to calm down .
well , these were meant to be a very special gift for someone .
yeah , we put quite a lot of thought into those .
isn' t that right ?
well , who were they for ?
my boyfriend .
my girlfriend .
her boyfriend .
his girlfriend .
one pair of gloves for two people ?
this is hard to explain .
try .
all right .
go ahead .
oh .
uh , well , he is at the present time my boyfriend .

after the operation

well
ah , well .
# have a yule that' s cool ##
they' re ready for you guys .
thank you .
i don' t know what you said to that guy makes any sense .
but i think we scared the be jesus out of him .
you were pretty fierce .
this will work , though .
this is quite a coffee .
but i' m serious about the check .
it' s the least i can do .
well , thank you , but , see , now i have to go find something else for my girlfriend .
oh , they were for your girlfriend .
yes , they were .
oh , i can' t accept them then .
well , you have to .
otherwise you won' t treat .
really .
let me tell you something .
this is the ultimate blend to drink .
where did you find this place ?
i first came in because of the name .
hmm .
serendipity .
it' s one of my favorite words .
it is ?
why ?
uh huh .
' cause it' s such a nice sound for what it means : a fortunate accident .
mm .
except i don' t really believe in accidents .
i think fate' s behind everything .
oh , you do ?
yeah .
fate' s behind everything ?
i think so .
everything' s predestined ?
we don' t have any choice at all ?
i thinkwe make our own decisions .
i just think that fate sends us little signs , and it' s how we read the signs that determines whether we' re happy or not .
little signals .
yeah .
yeah .
fortunate accidents .
lucky discoveries .
columbus in america .
yeah , or fleming discovering penicillin .
penicillin .
fleming is his name ?
yes .
or " jonathan and the gloves .
i don' t know that one .
you don' t know that story ?
it' s an old folk tale classic .
our hero , jonathan , goes out in search of black gloves .
and in a perfect act of " serendipiocity " or " serendipaciousness , " he runs into a beautiful , attractive english girl with a boyfriend .
you have a boyfriend , right ?
yeah , i do .
that' s what i thought .
and you have the glove lady .
yes , i do .
mm hmm .
it was a very nice time .
well , i hope you enjoy the gloves you bought yourself .
oh , i' m sure i will .
i usually appreciate my own thoughtfulness .
what do you want for christmas ?
golfclubs .
oh .
so you' re gonna meet your boyfriend now or what ?
no , i think he' s probably out doing what you' re doing .
getting a crush on someone else' s girlfriend ?
no , i' m sorry .
i just meant to say i had a really great time .
you know , maybe you should give me your phone number , you know , just in case .
in case of what ?
you know , in case of life .
i just had a great time , and i' d never be able to find you again .
well , if we' re meant to meet again , then we' il meet again .
it' s just not the right time now .
maybe we were supposed to meet on british time and we' re five hours too early .
come on .
i don' t even know your name .
my name is jonathan .
does that make you wanna tell me something ?
yeah , it does .
merry christmas , jonathan .
and thanks .
that' s it ?
# i can feel my heart #
oh , jesus , i' m sorry about that . # and it' s about to burst #
# i try to clean it up #
# but i just get worse #
# wish i could fall #
# on a night like this # # into your loving arms # i think i left a scarf .
no .
nothing down here .
why don' t you go upstairs ?
maybe it' s still there .
thank you .
# i thought i saw your face #
# in the evening sky #
# on a lonesome cloud #
# that was drifting by #
# i wish i could fall #
# on a night like this #
# into your loving arms ##
hey .
hey .
let' s go do something .
all right .
what you wanna do ?
i don' t care .
all right .
come on .
now , promise me you' re not just visiting here for a week ... or marrying somebody to get a green card or on parole .
none of the above .
you ?
no , no , no .
proud u. s. citizen .
no criminal record .
so you won' t tell me your name .
well , tell me , uh , what do you miss most about mother england ?
i miss my mom terribly .
if i were her , i' d miss you too .
okay .
favorite movie .
the correct answer is cool hand luke .
i' ve never seen it .
oh , come on .
you' ve never seen cool hand luke ?
paul newman ?
oh , my god .
come on !
failure to communicate .
sadistic cop in sunglasses with no name .
reminds me of you in that way .
um , favorite new york moment .
this one' s climbing the charts .
i' m flattered .
is there anything else you need to know about me ?
huh .
favorite sexual position ?
oh !
whoa !
whoa !
whoa !
yeah , yeah .
that' s my favorite too .
you all right ?
yeah .
did you hurt yourself ?
no .
yes .
you did ?
let' s take a look at that .
ouch .
oh , jesus .
that' s a deep , deep gash .
gaping .
what ?
we' il fix that right up .
there you go .
what ?
oh , you' re looking at my freckles .
it' s the curse of the english , i' m afraid .
fair skin and bad teeth .
no , you have great teeth .
those aren' t just freckles .
if you look closely , you can see cassiopeia .
what ?
right there .
hold on a minute .
okay .
all right , here' s the story .
a long time ago in ethiopia , there was this queen named cassiopeia ... who thought she was the most beautiful woman in the entire world , and there wasn' t anybody in the kingdom who wasn' t offended ... by this woman' s relentless vanity .
and then one day , she really screwed up and offended the gods .
i don' t remember what she did and i don' t remember who she offended .
but it was bad .
she crossed the line .
but anyway , poseidon , the sea god , punished cassiopeia ... by placing her in the heavens upside down on her throne , stuck for eternity with her skirt around her shoulders ... and all the blood rushing to her head .
and now she' s just a constellation in the sky , a bunch of english freckles in the shape of a throne .
so she made one tragic mistake .
and paid for eternity .
correct .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
legible , legible .
i can' t believe i' m doing this .
now , please , please .
let fate take its proper course .
oh !
that was an accident .
write down that again , please .
i can' t .
that was a sign .
fate' s telling us to back off .
if fate didn' t want us to be together , then why did we meet tonight , huh ?
gotcha .
well , i don' t know .
but it' s not an exact science .
it' s a feeling .
well , what if you' re wrong ?
huh ?
what if it' s all in our hands and we just walk away ?
no names , no phone numbers , nothing .
what do you think' s gonna happen ?
do you think good old fate is just gonna deliver my information ...
right to your doorstep ?
do you know that' s the best idea you' re had all night ?
what' s the best  here you go .
write your name and number down .
on a $5 . 00 bill ?
mm .
just do it .
you are a strange and interesting woman .
now what ?
wait there .
hey !
what the hell was that ?
when that $5 . 00 bill makes it back into my hands , i' il be able to call you .
and when you hear my voice on the other end , then you' il believe in fate , won' t you ? ##
hey , what about me ?
what do you mean ?
well , we have to send something out in the universe with your name on it , don' t we ?
come on .
isn' t that the only fair thing ?
that is the only fair thing .
what have i got , even ?
ooh .
no .
i have a really good idea .
what ?
okay .
that' s a lot of tuba .
okay , see this book ?
yeah .
okay , so when i get home tonight ,
i' m gonna write my name and number inside this book .
and then first thing tomorrow morning , i' il sell it to a used book store .
which one ?
you' re not gonna tell me .
you' re not gonna tell me .
why not ?
well , now , every time you go past an old book store , you' re gonna have to go inside to see if it' s there .
this is just wrong .
you don' t just have the most incredible night of your life ... with a perfect stranger and then leave it all to chance , do ya ?
do ya ?
come with me a second .
what , we' re gonna get a room ?
i' m kidding .
but i wanna know you more .
come on .
where are we going ?
okay .
now , you stay here .
okay .
no , stay here .
stay there .
don' t make me come over there .
okay .
all right , if we both randomly pick the same floor , we' re meant to be together now .
you' re insane .
come on .
okay , get in .
take a breath , and then when the door closes , hit a button .
i don' t understand this .
you don' t have to understand .
you just have to have faith .
faith in what ?
destiny .
hey !
it' s sara .
my name' s sara .
and here it is .
see ?
you were right .
uh  let' s go , buddy .
we' re going up here .
oh , that' s okay .
josh likes to ride either way .
don' t you , josh ?
don' t do that !
don' t touch those !
hey , calm down .
he' s just a kid .
looks like we' ve stopped .
we' re going again .
thank you .
where is she ?
is she here ?
no , no .
i don' t think so .

let' s go , buddy .
okay , stay alert .
is she here ?
no , not here .
back in the elevator .
she' s not here ?
come on !
come on !
move it !
come on , boy !
hey , sara .
i' m sorry .
hey .
i' m sorry .
what ?
i' m sorry .
i usually have to beg to be a part of weddings .
and if i do get into the wedding , of course they postponed it , and it' s overseas somewhere , and they' ve canceled my passport , and i can' t be a part of it , and it' s ridiculous and awkward and horrible .
so thank you .
i take this very seriously .
it' s a gift to be the best man .
they say that once in your lifetime , someone comes along ... whom you' re absolutely meant to be with .
everything feels great , stars are aligned , body and spirit are in balance .
formy friend jonathan trager , that person was me .
but as you know , jonny and i were simpatico .
we were brothers from another mother .
we were friends since freshman year .
i watched him go out with woman after woman , and he' d always come crawling he would come crawling back to me .
it was embarrassing .
you loved it .
but then one night he came home and things were different .
his adole scent dream of becoming a documentary filmmaker was a thing of the past .
thank god .
he hardly even responded ... to my playful yet tormented flicks of my finger ... against the soft part of his skull as he studied for finals .
and that is because he had found her .
the woman he was meant to be with .
and if anyone is qualified ... to know when he met his soul mate , it would be me , his first wife .
she' s smart , she' s funny , she' s beautiful .
in short , she' s the kind of woman that any man would dream about .
and i think we all have .
so it is with sadness ... and fond , fond memories ... that i raise my glass ... to the new mrs. jonathan trager .
i' il tell you what .
i' il tell you something .
my friends , if i had to lose jonny to anyone ,
i can' t imagine a more perfect woman than halley .
cheers to both of you .
how drunk is he on a scale of one to ten ?
twelve .
you think we' il ever out romance dean and courtney ?
i don' t know .
i don' t think i' ve ever seen them fight .
me neither .
must be a bitch on their sex life .
we have a pomegranate souffle which is amazing , which is different than the sorbet .
listen , we' d love to join you guys , but courtney has to wake up , so i got to be good .
halley , listen to me .
it' s not too late to back out .
good night , dean .
and i' m at 166th and
good night , courtney .
mama , you don' t want to see this .
i need i need to snuggle .
i' m gonna go sleep it off .
listen , you' re wonderful .
good night .
you know what ?
you need me .
take care .
come on , hon .
you guys , listen , i hate to tell you , but i gotta go home too .
i have to .
i gotta get up at 8 : 00 in the morning .
my day is crazy tomorrow .
come in for one drink .
he doesn' t want to come .
he doesn' t have to come .
i' il see you in about 20 hours .
bye bye , dear .
i love you , son .
night night .
george .
take care .
you okay ?
you better be up later .
yeah , why ?
because i' m gonna come home and get undressed ...
uh huh ? and climb into bed , uh huh ? act like we just got over a terrible fight .
see you later now .
reading is good for you .
knowledge .
reading ?
hold on , hold on .
listen , listen .
i read it a long time ago .
i' il throw in the screenplay to the bridges of madison county .
i saw the movie .
it was great .
okay , and
and nothing .
i mean i mean , i did nothing .
i i just let her walk out of the party and i didn' t say anything to her .
and now she' s gone forever .
i mean , she was my soul mate .
kenny , i honestly think it' s dangerous to use the term " soul mate .
it implies there' s some magical element that we have no control over ,
like fate or destiny .
i think holding on to beliefs like that stops us doing the real work .
and the fact is , if your therapy stays on track ,
i think you' il find there are many , many people out there you could easily be happy with .
you truly believe all that , sara ?
yeah .
i really do .
there you go .
thanks .

now , if you' re a golfer on a one hour lunch break , you' d use that time up just getting to the nearest course out of manhattan .
all this was a long overdue solution .
formerly a dilapidated pier and converted just five years ago , the range offers the inhabitants of this concrete jungle ... the chance to keep their drives straight , their short games accurate ... and most of all , brings the joys and frustrations of golf ... back to city folk .
this is nick roberts , espn news , new york city .
superb , nick .
we got it .
thank you .
artie , i gotta run , okay ?
what about the b roll shot ?
paging sara lawson .
paging sara lawson .

well , hello , mr. marrying man .
hi .
uh , where' s lauren ?
oh , lauren took the day off .
my name is sara and i' m gonna cut your hair today .
you know what ?
i' m not thrilled with having that " just cut hair " look for my own wedding , so
i' il just take a little bit off .
i gotta live with these pictures the rest of my life .
just a little bit .
please , you know , uh
# it' s you #
# and me forever #
# sara , smile # whoo !

mm hmm . # sara ##
whoo !
i' m telling you , i keep running into her .
i keep finding it .
it keeps happening .
she was at the golfrange .
she' s a big girl now with big hips .
all right ?
then i gotta leave ' cause sara' s gonna cut my hair ,
and the guy in the taxi , he' s serenading me , " sara .
i' m telling you , the universe keeps revealing her to me ,
screwing with my head .
you' re getting married in three days .
that' s my point .
it' s entirely duplicitous .
think about it .
why would you risk your relationship with halley ...
just to search for some pipe dream ?
just hear me out , man .
i' m sure that i love halley , all right ?
and maybe every time you fall in love with somebody , it' s a completely different experience .
so it' s a mistake to compare them .
i get it , but
all right .
it' s like halley is the godfather , partil .
she' s what ?
godfather , partil .
that was an incredible movie .
might be better than the original .
all right ?
but no matter how much you love the godfather , partil , you still have to see the original ... to understand and appreciate the sequel , don' tya ?
come on .
is it too much to ask from my oldest friend to help me out ?
you' ve already got the fairy tale marriage .
i' m the best man .
you work in the biggest newspaper in the world .
help me find her .
let me tell you something .
contrary to popular new york myth , the times is not omniscient .
i need a last name .
i need a social security number .
if we find the book  it it it' s a dead end .
you know that .
unless we search every book store in new york .
you did that .
years ago .
do you remember ?
maybe i missed a store .
maybe somebody bought it and sold it back .
you know what ?
i don' t want any part of this .
all right ?
maybe i am just getting cold feet .
i' m telling you right now , british women do not age well .
you know , i mean , years ago , yes , she was a luscious treat .
you know , she probably looked like , you know , baby spice .
but now she could look like
old spice .
it' s a great haircut .
oh .
thanks .
tell me you love me .
i love you .
tell me something romantic .
like what ?
i don' t know .
like ... how i' m the only girl in the entire universe meant for you .
oh , my god , the dinner !
by the way , i emptied your closet .
we gotta pack for the honeymoon .
god , i hate this building .
shut up !
don' t hit it with the thing .
jon !
what ?
i' m gonna go yell at the super .
i don' t understand why this is going off .
you said last week it would be fine .
hey , jon .
this place looks like a disaster area .
thanks , gerald .
gerald , it' s in here .
i gotta get going .
coming !
come on !
i wanna see !
i wanna see !
i thought you wanted a round cut diamond .
why ?
when did i say that ?
i' m not exactly sure .
but when we were younger , i think .
oh , god .
when i was younger , i was gonna marry boris becker , wasn' t i ?
hey , guys .
what did you think ?
hey !
well , i mean , was that last song really inspired by my sister ?
every artist needs his muse .
who wants to hear the good news ?
hey , i pay you for the good news .
no .
you pay me to keep away the bad news .
bring it on .
lars ' dates in stockholm sold out in eight hours .
wow !
that means we' re gonna have to add some more shows .
so we' il bump paris
sorry .
i don' t wanna spoil anyone' s party , but lars and i have already set the dates for our honeymoon and our wedding , and i' ve told my patients when i' m going .
well , baby , your patients can do without you for a couple weeks .
he' s right , sara .
i mean , a couple of extra weeks in europe aren' t gonna kill you .
caroline' s just pushing you to stay longer ...
' cause she wants us to house sit for you guys .
yeah , thank you .
i was going to ask her when she was drunk .
actually , that' s a great idea .
yeah ?
yes !
come on , kip .
let' s get out of here before sara changes lars ' mind .
i said something wrong ?
no , it' s
i' ve just got a very detailed schedule ... and my patients are important too .
i don' t like changing the dates at the last minute .
excuse me .
i' m sorry .
but i really need you to approve these t shirt designs foraustralia .
oh , no problem .
you don' t mind , do you ?
can we do this later ?
yeah .
she don' t mind .
that' s chamomile for you ladies .
nice and hot .
very good .
thanks .
sara , it was a movie poster .
it' s no big deal .
it' s peculiar though , right ?
don' t you think ?
look , i thought you were through with all this new age bullshit ...
like horoscopes and feng shui and all the crap .
eve , for someone who owns a new age store , you are alarmingly earthbound .
oh , yeah ?
and for a shrink in training , you are a little bit crazy .
i' il tell you that much .
excuse me .
do you carry the casanova candle ?
as a matter of fact , we do .
check on the shelf across from the caligula incense .
and they' re on sale , so today' s your lucky day .
great .
you see , that is what happens ... when people get hooked on the new age life .
they end up sitting at home burning candles for mr. right ... when mr. good enough for right now is waiting at the corner bar .
hi .
oh , yeah .
she' s a pain in the ass .
and i gotta find her .
i' ve been here three years , so this is
yeah , i understand .
but your computer system has been here for a long time .
i think i think you' re just wasting my time , sir .
no , no .
here' s the thing .
there' s nothing i can do .
it' s very crucial .
you cannot be over here .
you cannot come over ...
to this side of the counter .
all right .
please don' t cross this line .
thank you .
all i really need ... is if you can enter this account number in the computer ...
and just tell me her name .
oh , i see .
when you put it that way , no .
would 20 bucks help ?
it might if i was a health inspector .
listen , this is really important .
oh , boy , did it again .
crossed the line .
you have to remain on the other side of the register .
i don' t wanna say it again .
remain on that side .
thank you .
let' s bottom line this , huh ?
what' s it gonna take ?
i have to have the name .
well , i was a little short on myweekly sales draw .
were you ?
i' m just mentioning .
okay .
um , i' m going to , uh [ muttering ]
uh uh .
look where my feet are .
allright ?
lovely choice , sir .
thank you .
account number was 029351
i thought you said you were gonna help with my weekly draw .
the tie' s worth $95 .
we' re still 700 short . $700 ?
that' s extortion .
700 .
that' s good salesmanship , sir .
what do i need ?
ring it up .
well , we have a purple tie .
what would go with a purple tie ?
mm hmm .
i look like a magician .
all right , you horrible little man .
i bought the entire spring line .

i already did .
it was a dead account .
there' s no information in our computers .
you give me that ?

chase you ?
what ?
are you insane ?
don' t cross the line !
you crossed the line !
stop saying that or i will cut you !
now , you better find a way to help me right now !
i can suggest another option .
suggest it fast .
when our customers apply for a credit card , the hard copies go to our storage facility in queens .
all you need is the account number , which you already have , and you can find her application .
however , you need an employee to get you in .
you need an employee ... to get you in .
crocodile .
hal .
halley .

the problem is you can' t fend off an army of blood thirsty vikings with a shehnai .
it' s illogical .
no , see no , no .
you' re lulling them into submission with the music .
that' s the whole point of the song , really .
mystic surrender .
you don' t think he looks like he hates the music ?
no .
hey .
hey , baby .
now , this guy , he' s he' s like alec guinness .
so good .
yeah .
star wars .
obi wan .

what' s their attitude ?
whatare they thinking ?
whoare thesepeople ?
they' re in awe and speechless .
and they' re just grateful .
underfed .

yeah .
sara , hey .

i lost my keys yesterday .
oh , that' s a drag .
and i' ve just found them in the freezer .
i don' t get it .
is that a joke ?
no , lars , it' s not a joke .
i feel like i' m losing my mind .
it' s the wedding plans and the tour and my patients .
it' s just a bit too much to deal with .
okay , sara , look .
we' re leaving for toronto in the morning ,
so don' t fall apart on me now .
i know , i know , i know .
and that' s why i think i need a little break .

i just mean a weekend away to recharge my batteries and clear my head .
hey , this has nothing to do with the other night .
i just need this .

sara , really , this is way too generous of you .
oh , come on .
can' t a girl do something nice for her friend on her birthday ?
there' s no ulterior motives ?
well , yeah .
i' m getting married in a week and i' d just like to have one last fling ... with my best friend before i walk down the aisle .

ah ah !

0293 .
congratulations .
you got it ?
i think you found her .
too bad the last name' s completely smudged out , though .
well , it' s his fault .
it was his thumb .
when he grabbed it , his thumb went right across the name .
completely .
i' m kidding .
it was smudged in my hand .
would you stop it ?
it' s just a little joke .
that' s carbon paper for you .
i guess that' s why america rejected it .
what' s that address ?
is that her address ?
that' s seven years ago , man .
so go to the building leasing office ... and you' il find out who lived there seven years ago .
it ain' t rocket science .
thank you .
hi .
hey .
where to ?
yeah , where are we going ?
uh , okay , take us ... anywhere in new york .
excuse me ?
anywhere .
wherever you feel like going .
that' s not a destination , lady .
wait .
you didn' t make reservations ?
um , okay , eve , please don' t get mad at me .
what ?
oh , no .
i cannot believe this .
i need a borough here , ladies .

that' s really sneaky of you , sara .
i' m not a bloody psychic .
eve , wait !

i knew you wouldn' t come if i told you the truth .
i needed my best friend with me .
what are you doing , sara ?
honestly , sara , i don' t understand you anymore , okay ?
please , tell me something .
tell me anything that makes just a little bit of sense .
i' ve just spent the entire flight ... staring into the sky , thinking .
not about my fiance , but about this mystery guy ...
i met a million and a half hours ago .
a guy i don' t even remember , except for this ... vague picture i have inside my head .
it was just a few seconds .
a fragment , really .
and it was like ... in that moment , the whole universe existed just to bring us together .
that' s why i' m here .
that' s why i' m gonna let fate take me wherever it wants to go .
because when all this is over , at least i' m never gonna have to think of him ever again .
let' s just pray he' s a bald fascist ... who picks his nose and wipes it under the car seat .
hi .
hi .
could you hold on ?
where are you going ?
you better be buying me one frigging big birthday cake , that' s all i gotta say .
could i get your destination , please ?
the waldorf , i guess .
finally she gets it .
okay , we are going ... that way .
and i' m gonna follow .
you can do it yourself .
just open up the computer and look into it .
i' m not even sure that i can give you this information .
if you can' t , why can' t you ?
because i' m just a temp , okay ?
i don' t know the rules .
couple of months out of college , you' re acting like you' re part of the establishment .
no , no , no , no , no what about privacy law , huh ?
forget about privacy laws .
you know what privacy laws do ?
no .
they protect millionaires .
do you know who those are ?
who ?
tell him who they are .
tell him .
kids your age .
pimple faced college dropouts who have made unhealthy sums of money ... forming internet companies that create no concrete products , provide no viable services and still manage to generate profits ... for all of its lazy , day trading , son of a bitch shareholders .
meanwhile , as a tortured member of the disenfranchised proletariat , you find some altruistic need to protect these digital plantation owners ?
wow .

i think i swallowed a filling .
thank you for letting us in .
now , mr. mignon , we have an odd and some what personal question to ask you .
mignon .
mr. mignon .
mignon .
like the meat .
mr. mignon , a few years ago , did you live with a girl , first name sara ?
attractive , dark hair , kind of , like , mysterious , you know , really amazing ...
girl .
oui .
do you know where we can locate this individual ?
no , i do not .
do you remember her last name ?
no .
oh , come on .
you don' t even remember the last name of your ex girlfriend ?
i find that hard to believe .
you don' t understand anything .
she was not my girlfriend .
she was just , uh , a roommate .
she stayed with me for a very short period of time .
she was placed with me by  a roommate finder' s service ?
oui .
she stayed with me with her boyfriend for a few months
i don' t care about him .
and then he moved out very quickly .
and at the end of the year , she moved out too .
yeah , but did she leave anything behind , maybe with her last name on it , like a receipt , a bill ?
like a piece of luggage ?
no .
no , no .
anything would help , really .
anything .
i remember she sat on me .
she she sat on you ?
yes .
she sat on me for a while .
i found her ... inspiring .
i guess that is why i started painting her in the first place .
oh .
she sat for you .
i' m sorry .
that is what i said .
that' s what he said .
that' s what i said .
clearly .
do you happen to have the painting ?
hey , now you' re gonna see what it' s all about .
you know , you see her face .
okay .
yeah .
this is her , yes ?
yeah , sure .
around the eyes a little .
i mean , i' m definitely getting the british thing , you know , with the crown and the scepter .
do you have a name for the roommate finder' s service ?
they would have the information .
no , i do not .
but if it helps , i do remember where the service was located .
absolutely !
yes !
where ?
where ?
manhattan .
where in manhattan , mr. mignon ?
on 60thstreet .
east side or west side ?
it was just next to that on the left of that splendid little patisserie ,
serendipity .
that' sit .
get get ready .
happy birthday .
it' s on the house .
thank you .
thanks .
oh , i' m a god awful friend .
no , you will be if you sing .
eve , thanks so much for coming with me .
you' re welcome .
sara , you know , it' s a wonderful thought .
the idea that all of life , that every single event is part of some master plan ... designed to lead us to our universal soul mate .
but if that' s really true , then what' s the point of living ?
or making decisions ?
hell , why should we even get out of bed in the morning ?
for the cake ?
no .
not for cake .
so that you make mistakes .
mistakes like this trip .
and if you' re smart enough , you learn from your mistakes .
you figure it out .
you you think .
you realize that life isn' t some elaborate stage play with directions for the actors .
life' s a mess , sara .
it' s it' s chaos personified .
i have to give it all up now , don' t i ?
sara , you have a fiance who , despite his weird eastern music , which we hope is just a phase , let' s hope ,
loves you very , very , very much .
it' s not giving up .
it' s growing up .
let' s get out of here .
yeah .
here' s one .
ooh , catch it .
it' s a bridal shop .
oh , my god .
the irony .
wait right here .
i' il be right back .
stay here .
why ?
time , please ?
uh , about 7 : 30 .
right .
right .
they moved downtown .
if we get lucky with traffic , we can still hit it .
what time is rehearsal ?
can' t do it .
taxi !
it' s over , man .
what ?
what are you talking about ?
how can i ignore that ?
bless the goddamn bride " ?
what ?
it can' t get any more clearer than this .
i' m not supposed to be doing this .
it' s not in the cards .
hey , it' s another one of your clues , man .
let' s talk about it in the cab ...
on the way over .
it' s not a clue .
it' s a sign .
what' s the difference ?
a clue is what a detective uses to find a suspect .
the receipt , the warehouse , that french guy those are clues .
this is a sign .
me never finding the book , that' s a sign .
sara never finding the $5 . 00 bill , that' s a sign .
how could something not happening be a sign ?
maybe the absence of signs is a sign .
isn' t it ?
that' s lucid .
look , i don' t know , man .
maybe there is no fate .
and if there is , it' s not working for me .
you know , it' s not actually supposed to end this way , by the way .
we' re supposed to pull the curtain and see the wizard , all right ?
get to the end of the river .
this is the end of the river .
my wedding rehearsal ... starts in less than an hour .
my bride is waiting for me .
let me ask you something here .
if sara were here right now , poof , came down , what would she tell you to do ?
she would tell me to run , not walk to the waldorf ... because all the signs point to me getting married .
look .
wedding dress .
lots of white .
i hate to state the obvious  state it .
if you don' t do this , you may never find out who sara is .
maybe i was never supposed to .
maybe all this is just a maze ... designed to lead me directly back to where i started .
which is getting married .
they should make pills for this .
halley ?
oh , my god .
eve !
what a crazy coincidence !
how are you ?
good .
oh , my god .
sara , can you believe ... that i was halley' s r. a. in college ?
isn' t that funny ?
oh , i' m sorry .
this is sara .
hi .
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you too .
oh , my gosh .
what' s it been , like eight or nine years ?
eve was , uh i went to b. u. with eve .
well , isn' t that wonderful ?
yeah .
how about that ?
so what are you doing here ?
i' m getting married tomorrow .
you are ?
congratulations .
congratulations .
wow !

you must be very proud .
okay , so have a good one .
i' il see you later .

good bye , my sweet lesbian lady lover .
i' m just kidding .
it' s just a joke between us .
lars ?
what are you doing ?
how did you know where i was ?
intuition .
really ?
no .
i went through the new york hotel guide .
alphabetically , in reverse .
i started with " z.
sara , i missed you so much .
i' m sorry .
i don' t blame you for running away .
i was so ... focused on the album , the video .
i , jonathan , take you , halley , to be my wife , and i promise to love and sustain you ... in the bond of marriage from this day forward .
and obviously , jonathan , you' il be looking at halley .
and that' s when the actual ceremony will conclude .
excuse me .
i need some help over here .
what ?
and then then you' re married .
hal , who' s that girl over there ?
oh , that' s my old friend eve .
oh .
okay , everyone , that' s a wrap .
and now make sure to be here tomorrow morning at 9 : 00 sharp for pictures .
i hate to break up a good thing , but we have some strippers waiting for us .
we' re late .
you mean " exotic dancers .
no , no .
i mean " strippers .
the women who take off everything .
i' il see you men at 9 : 00 .
but remember , i promised judy i' d be home by 10 : 00 .
fantastic .
it gives you an hour to get crazy .
let' s get into it .
before you take jon and dad off to your male bonding ritual , i need to talk to him .
okay .
beautiful bride .
i' il be in the cab .
hi .
i want you to meet jon .
hi .

nice to meet you .
bye .
see you .
halley , what is it ?
what' s wrong ?
it' s you .
what do you mean , it' s me ?
what did i do ?
nothing , exactly .
it' s just this feeling i have , like
like you' ve been somewhere else for the past few days .
that' s not true .
don' t lie to me , jonathan .
i' ve dreamed about this my entire life , and and ...
i' ve imagined the dress and the flowers ... and even the music the band was gonna play .
and everything is exactly the way i want it , except for my fiance , who' s just decided to float off to never never land .
look , maybe i' ve been a little bit out of it the past week , but it' s just normal , you know , guy stuff .
it' s a little cold feet .
doesn' t mean i don' t love you .
well , call me crazy , but i' d like my fiance' s feet to be warm , especially when we' re hours from going down the aisle .
i' m sorry , hal .
really , i am .
whatever it is that you' re holding on to , please just let it go .
please .
i think it already let go of me , okay ?
wait .
what' s this ?
what do you think ?
it' s the traditional groom' s gift .
i got yours , and i forgot to bring it .
i know .
it' s okay .
open it .
it' s a first edition .
it' s just that every time we go into a bookstore , you' re always flipping through it .
and i checked this week .
you don' t even have a copy .
what' s wrong ?
don' t you like it ?
it' s perfect .
it' s an excellent choice .

i forbid you to look .
you can' t look !

when god shuts a door , he opens a window .
how about telling me i did the right thing ?

good luck , man .
thank you .
jonathan trager , prominent televisionproducer for espn , died last night from complications of losing his soulmate and his fiance .
he was 35 years old and soft spoken and obsessive .
trager never looked the part of a hopeless romantic .
but in the final days of his life , he revealed an unknown side of his psyche .
this hidden quasi jungian persona ... surfaced during the agatha christie like pursuit for his long reputed soulmate , a woman whom he only spent a few precious hours with .
sadly , the protracted search ended late saturday night ... in complete and utter failure .
yet even in certain defeat , the courageous trager secretly clung to the belief ... that life is not merely a series of meaningless accidents or coincidences .
uh uh .
but rather it' s a tapestry of events ... that culminate in an exquisite , sublime plan .
asked about the loss of his dear friend , dean kansky , the pulitzer prize winning author and executive editor of the new york times , described jonathan as a changed man in the last days of his life .
things were clearer for him , " kansky noted .
ultimately , jonathan concluded that if weare to live life in harmony with the universe , we must all possess a powerful faith in what the ancients used to call " fatum ,
what we currently refer to as destiny .
destiny .
