chris , what is it ?
i love you so much .
don' t you love me any more ?
i' ve made progress , and i recognise that .
but my wife , who i can' t even convince to come here ...
anything can set her off .
it could be the phone ringing , something on the news , something online , going shopping maybe .
a commemorative t shirt in the window .
itjust puts her right back in that place , and it' s like all my progress ripped away .
and i' m right back there with her .
i feel totally the opposite .
i see the tv and i see the internet and i see those t shirts and i feel nothing .
the more i see the images , the less i feel , the less i believe that it' s real .
i mean , i think i' m supposed to feel something by now .
don' t you think so ?
linda , this is chris kelvin .
i' m returning your call .
i have two times available this week ; 7am on tuesday or 6 . 15pm on thursday .
you can leave a message if either of those times are good for you .
thank you .
well , i know that' s not true .
because i know you , and i know it' s not true .
good .
i' m glad .
all right .
let' s pick this up on wednesday .
can i help you ?
we' re looking for dr chris kelvin .
chris ...
i can' t imagine what you must be thinking , getting a message like this .
i apologise if it seems melodramatic , but you are the only person i can trust in the situation .
i need your help .
i need you to come to solaris , chris .
i don' t know how to describe what we are experiencing up here .
we can' t even agree amongst ourselves what is happening , or what to do about it .
i suppose the most obvious solution would be to leave .
but none of us want to .
that' s why you' re getting this bizarre request .
i told the crew that your background and experiences made you the ideal candidate for this job .
don' t worry .
i didn' t elaborate .
but it' s true .
so , anyway ...
i hope you will come to solaris , chris .
i think you need to .
you will see what i mean .
i wish i could be more specific about all of this , but , you know .
people are listening .
you can imagine the distress dr gibarian' s message caused at dba .
why not send in the security force ?
we did .
we lost contact as they were approaching solaris .
they haven' t returned .
there must be some sort of on board al system .
they shut it down .
the company was hoping to solve this problem without involving a civilian .
obviously these are extreme circumstances .
some preparation is involved but you shouldn' t have any trouble .
the flight itself is fully automated .
you' il be asleep most of the trip .
we feel confident that if you board the ship , you can negotiate their safe return .
is that what everybody wants ?
of course .
find the probability of f.
ok , stop .
go back .
snow .
kelvin , is it ?
yeah .
kelvin .
right .
oh , man .
sorry about that , kelvin .
names , you know , just ...
for some reason .
yeah .
well , you wanna come in ?
i' m fine .
whose blood is that , leading to the lab ?
yeah .
blood .
how ' bout that ?
katarn .
he , um ...
security forces showed up and he just took off , and they put a hole in his pot .
what happened to gibarian ?
it was a suicide .
who found him ?
i found him .
what happened to rhys ?
yeah , now , rhys ...
we don' t know , because the thing is , he kind of disappeared .
disappeared ?
disappeared .
how did he disappear ?
exactly .
don' t know .
we do know that he' s not on the ship , and that' s all we know .
where' s dr gordon ?
dr gordon .
she is in her room , and dr gordon won' t let you in her room .
can you tell me what' s happening here ?
i could tell you what' s happening , but i don' t know if that' d really tell you what' s happening .
i just wanna talk to you .
you have to give me your word you won' t try to come in .
all right .
well ?
what happened to gibarian ?
didn' t you talk to snow ?
i wanted to hear your version .
there isn' t any version .
he killed himself .
why haven' t you come home ?
what happened here ?
what did you find ?
who are you representing ?
i' m the last effort to recover this mission , before they abandon this ship and everyone on board .
until it starts happening to you , there' s really no point in discussing it .
who else is here ?
who else is here ?
i saw a boy .
gibarian' s son .
michael .
how is that possible ?
i think that' s why you' re here .
i want a formal interview with you and gordon .
i' il need your help with her .
yeah .
all right .
how much sleep do you need , kelvin ?
how much sleep ?
yeah .
how long can you go without sleep ?
depends .
well , when you do go to sleep ,
i find i sleep much better with the door locked .
i was with the project when it was still with nasa , before it was sold to dba .
i was trained in physics .
i was sent here to assess the economic potential of solaris .
whether or not it was a viable commercial property or possible energy source .
i was still compiling data when this shit started happening .
did you run any tests on the food , air , water ?
i checked it 50 times .
there are no signs of contaminants or psychotropic compounds .
how about you ?
how are you doing ?
depression .
along with bouts of hypomania and primary insomnia .
suggestions of agoraphobia , obsessive compulsive disorder , shock , fatigue , denial .
not unusual , given the circumstances .
i know .
all right .
now , what can you tell me about what' s happening here ?
just that i want it to stop , but i want to stop it .
if i can stop it that means i' m smarter than it is .
you know you can go home , walk away from all of this .
i can guarantee it .
yeah .
the thing is ...
man , i would kill to go back there .
i' d kill .
but gordon ?
gordon happens to be gordon , you know ?
but i' il see what i can do .
we take off into the cosmos .
ready for anything solitude , hardship , exhaustion .
death .
we' re proud of ourselves .
but when you think about it , our enthusiasm' s a sham .
we don' t want other worlds .
we want mirrors .
so , anyway ...
how' s the spawn ?
oh , good .
he cries and shits in his pants every two hours .
i know the feeling .
when are you leaving ?
we' ve been postponed again .
i didn' t hear that .
nobody knows yet .
the governments are looking for a buyer .
i wish we could tell people what' s happening .
you can tell me .
i' m a doctor .
well , doctor , as we study solaris , the most interesting thing is it ...
well , it seems to be reacting .
almost like it knows it' s being observed .
we can' t explain it .
are you listening to me ?
chris ?
so anyway ...
so anyway .
sorry .
go to her .
her name is rheya .
she' s a bit tricky but i guess she' s worthwhile .
maybe she needs a shrink .
don' t we all ?
don' t blow it .
you start .
i did .
really ?
all right , i' m gonna resist the impulse to ask you about the door knob .
do you always resist your impulses ?
not always .
try poetry .
and death shall have no dominion .
thomas .
it' s not a very happy poem , though .
well , you didn' t seem very happy when i saw you on the train .
i wasn' t .
and tonight ?
it' s early .
goddammit .
i' m awake .
yes .
how are you here ?
how do you mean ?
where do you think you are ?
where do you think you are right now ?
at home .
where is home ?
with you , where we live .
and do you remember being anywhere else with me ?
being together anywhere else ?
our apartment .
describe it .
it' s dark .
it' s very very dark .
and there are no paintings on the wall .
no pictures anywhere .
no pictures on the fridge , even , which i always thought was a bit strange .
do you remember where we first saw each other ?
on a train .
chris ...
i' m so happy to see you .
i love you so much .
don' t you love me any more ?
i have to check out something with the crew .
no !
don' t leave me !
why ?
why ?
i don' t know .
it' s ok .
why are you sitting over there ?
can i come and sit with you ?
hey .
what was that ?
yeah .
how ' bout that ?
still workin ' on that .
where' s your visitor ?
i don' t know .
stopped appearing .
who' s your visitor ?
my brother .
who was it ?
my wife .
dead ?
so what was her name ?
will she come back ?
do you want her to ?
no , it isn' t .
yes , it is .
no , it isn' t .
it' s crap .
only one way to find out .
you can submit it to someone and see if they publish it .
that' s not an indication of anything .
so no one else' s opinion counts except for yours ?
yeah .
that' s insane .
that' s insane .
i like it .
brings out the red in my eyes .
did you show it to your father ?
yeah .
and ?
and he liked it .
what' d he say ?
he said he liked it .
well ...
he' s a man who doesn' t pass out compliments very easily .
that' s something .
what' s that tell you ?
can we talk about something else ?
please ?
all right .
when do you wanna get hitched ?
every time i bring it up you make ajoke about it , and ...
i know .
i' m sorry .
it' s just ...
it' s so difficult for me .
still ?
is it something that i' m not doing ?
no .
that' s not the issue at all .
because , you know , if you keep putting this off , then in 15 or 20 years i' m just gonna stop asking .
well , i' ve got ages , then .
so apart from the poem that you quoted to me the night that we met ...
the night that you were hitting on me .
oh , i don' t think so .
what' s your favourite poem ?
my favourite dylan thomas poem ?
well , there' s the ...
there' s the ...
" there was a young man from nantucket ...
i knew it .
i just ...
i' m not marrying you .
oh , you' re marrying me .
would we have to invite anyone else ?
there should be witnesses .
otherwise nobody' d believe us .
when i was little i had this imaginary friend called mikashelli , who used to live under the wallpaper in the corner of the room .
i used to go and visit .
i had a very intense relationship .
i was an only child .
as you know .
that was like my sibling .
that was the person i used to have battles with and fights with and everything .
what happened progressively over the next few years is that my mother stopped communicating with me .
she only communicated with me as mikashelli , and wrote me these letters , and we didn' t have conversations any more .
admittedly , she was certifiable .
but that was a strange way to grow up .
you know , you' re with the right man .
i so know that .
that' s what' s great .
cos , man ...
rheya .
it' s me .
i don' t remember that .
when did you get that ?
i got itjust before i came here .
was i with you ?
no .
i don' t actually remember anything .
i only remember you .
have i been ill ?
sort of .
and we' ve been apart ?
yes .
for how long ?
a few years .
were you alone ?
yes .
was that difficult ?
it was easier than being with someone else .
did you think about me ?
yes .
what is that , out there ?
solaris .
oh , my god , yes .
i can' t remember how i got here .
did i come here with you ?
i don' t know how you got here .
what do you mean ?
i woke up and you were here .
so i wasn' t here yesterday ?
no .
right .
getting dressed ?
people will notice tonight .
if you' re not there , rheya , people will notice .
i can put up with all of it , you know ?
the mood swings , the restlessness , changing jobs every three months , all of it .
what i can' t put up with is you hiding from me .
why do you do that ?
do you wanna be here ?
cos i need help .
i can' t do this ...
i can' t continue to do this on my own .
the idea of god was dreamed up by man .
a silly animal with a small brain .
even the limits that we put on it are human limits .
it designs , it creates ...
no , i' m talking about a higher intelligence .
no , hold it .
you' re talking about something else a man in a white beard .
ascribing human characteristics to something that isn' t human .
aren' t we all ?
rheya , given all the elements of the known universe and enough time , our existence is inevitable .
it' s no more mysterious than trees or sharks .
we' re a mathematical probability , and that' s all .
how do you explain that of all the creatures on this planet , only we are conscious of our own mortality ?
you can' t explain that .
that doesn' t mean there' s a god .
maybe religion has been bred into us .
the pope is a wonderful woman ...
excuse me .
a nihilistic shrink .
is there a school ?
not yet .
you see ?
he' s funny , at least .
where you been ?
away from those fucking people .
they' re my friends .
yeah .
chris , i' ve got to talk to you .
what' s wrong ?
i don' t understand what' s happening .
and if i do understand what' s happening then i don' t think i can handle it .
what do you mean ?
i mean ...
i' m not the person i remember .
or at least i' m not sure i am .
i do remember things , but i don' t remember being there .
i don' t remember experiencing those things .
i' m really really trying to understand .
and these ...
these strange thoughts keep coming into my head , and i don' t know where they' re coming from , and i' m scared .
and i don' t know what' s happening .
what do you think' s happening ?
you need rest .
no .
take that .
you don' t understand .
because i don' t think that i can live with this .
i don' t understand what is happening now .
this i remember this .
i have a memory of it .
but i don' t .
i don' t remember seeing it .
i don' t remember being there .
rheya , it' s fatigue .
it' s brought on by stress .
it' s fatigue .
that' s why you take this .
right .
yeah .
no , it is .
you' il be fine .
i' il talk to gordon and snow .
we' il go back to earth .
and you' re gonna be fine .
i' m coming right back .
right .
are you gonna be all right here ?
yeah .
this door locks from the inside .
yeah .
you' il be perfectly safe in here .
yeah .
you sure you' re gonna be all right ?
you keep asking me that , actually .
yes .
yeah .
i' m fine .
stay here .
i was so worried , man .
about this guy .
but then you show up , and i' m even more worried about you .
particularly after the first ...
when you sent the first one away .
yeah , you were pretty ...
you deserved to be as freaked out as you were .
she can never know anything about that .
ever .
you understand ?
no .
i wonder if they can get pregnant .
where are you going ?
i can' t be here .
what ?
you should have told me .
it wouldn' t have made any difference .
really ?
chris , i had to .
obviously i had to .
you know that about me .
i had no idea you' d react like this .
listen .
listen to me .
what' s changed ?
i didn' t even know you wanted one .
why would i want one ?
why would i want a child , or anything that would bring life into this house ?
no , chris .
no .
stop it .
no , chris , you don' t understand .
you have to understand .
i had no idea you felt like that .
i won' t make it without you .
then you won' t make it .
chris , no , please .
let go of me !
no !
no !
oh , my god .
oh , no .
you wanna change gordon' s mind .
what if gordon and your wife , your very nice wife ...
she' s nice , right ?
of course she' s nice .
your wife is nice .
they get together , right ?
cos i' m thinkin ' " women " , right ?
right now we got woman and woman , right ?
if we get women together on the same team and all that shit , what happens ?
you know what happens .
all kinds of shit you can' t explain happens .
but good shit , you know ?
mysterious , but good .
usually very good .
things get solved , you know ?
that' s my plan , you know ?
what do you think ?
i' il have to think about that .
and death shall have no dominion .
dead men naked , they shall be one
with the man in the wind and the west moon .
when their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone ,
they shall have stars at elbow and foot .
though they go mad they shall be sane .
though they sink through the sea they shall rise again .
though lovers be lost love shall not .
and death shall have no dominion .
you found me .
i came back for you .
i came back that day .
i' m sorry .
all right .
enough hypothesising .
the visitors .
are they or are they not made of subatomic particles ?
subatomic particles .
i' m not sure .
what do you think ?
i think probably .
stabilised by what ?
guess .
i don' t know .
maybe a higgs field .
so if we created a negative higgs field and bombarded them with higgs antibosons they might disintegrate ?
maybe .
you know , it would take a lot of power .
shut down all the noncritical ship functions .
this is just a theory , you know ?
we could be wrong .
let' s find out .
we' il take the findings back to earth .
what if they follow us back ?
what if what' s happening here happened on earth on a mass scale ?
don' t you see that as a problem ?
i think it' s a serious mistake to assume it' s benign .
it' s driving us crazy so it can watch us kill each other .
is that really why you think they' re here ?
given its resources it could have done anything , including destroy us .
meet me in the lab in an hour .
i won' t let you .
how you gonna stop us ?
how you gonna stop me taking her back ?
shall we pick up the other one on the way ?
shouldn' t be too hard .
we could chart its course .
only take a day or so .
chris , what' s she talking about ?
nothing .
her oxygen might have run out .
maybe they don' t need any .
chris , what are they talking about ?
you didn' t tell her ?
tell me what ?
you came before .
he got rid of you .
you what ?
i sent you away .
into space .
oh , my god .
no .
rheya ...
don' t touch me .
rheya , i didn' t understand .
rheya .
don' t .
no .
don' t .
what were you trying to accomplish with that , exactly ?
kelvin ...
it is a mistake to become emotionally engaged with one of them .
you' re being manipulated .
if she were ugly , you wouldn' t want her around .
that' s why she' s not ugly .
she' s a mirror that reflects part of your mind .
you provide the formula .
she' s alive .
she is not human .
try to understand that , if you can understand anything .
what about your visitor ?
the one you' re so ready to destroy without hesitation ?
who is it ?
what is it ?
does it feel ?
can it touch ?
does it speak ?
we are in a situation that is beyond morality .
your wife is dead .
how do you know ?
how can you be definitive about a construct you do not understand ?
she' s a copy .
a facsimile .
and she' s seducing you all over again .
you' re sick .
we are not taking her back with us .
leave the light off .
you think you' re dreaming me .
you' re not gibarian .
no ?
who am i , then ?
a puppet .
and you' re not ?
well , maybe you' re my puppet .
but like all puppets , you think you' re actually human .
that' s the puppet' s dream being human .
why did you kill yourself ?
it seemed like a good idea at the time .
now i think i made a mistake .
what about your son ?
that' s not my son .
my son is on earth .
and that' s not your wife .
they are part of solaris .
remember that .
what does solaris want from us ?
why do you think it has to want something ?
this is why you have to leave .
if you keep thinking there is a solution , you' il die here .
i can' t leave her .
i' il figure it out .
do you understand what i' m trying to tell you ?
there are no answers .
only choices .
rheya ?
gordon !
what happened ?
she drank liquid oxygen .
she' s dead .
no .
i never get used to them .
these resurrections .
oh , no .
no .
why' d you do that ?
rheya ?
don' t call me that .
there are two components .
a high energy proton accelerator and a matter phase modulator .
by adjusting the tuning frequency i get an enhancement of higgs antibosons at 90ghz and an almost pure beam at 160ghz .
i used it on mine .
what happens ?
they disappear , back where they came from .
it' s what she wants .
i won' t let her do it .
she' il come to me when you' re asleep .
then i won' t sleep .
don' t you see ?
i came from your memory of her .
that' s the problem .
i' m not a whole person .
in your memory you get to control everything .
so even if you remember something wrong , i am predetermined to carry it out .
i' m suicidal because that' s how you remember me .
my voice sounds the way it does because that' s how you remember it .
i don' t believe that we' re predetermined to relive our past .
i think that we can choose to do it differently .
the day i left and you said you wouldn' t make it , i didn' t hear you because i was angry .
this is my chance to undo that mistake .
and i need you to help me .
but am i really rheya ?
i don' t know any more .
all i see is you .
all i see is you .
it created me .
and yet i can' t communicate with it .
it must hear me , though .
it must know what' s happening to me .
and you and i , we would have to have some kind of an arrangement , some kind of
unspoken understanding that i' m not really a human being .
no , rheya .
chris ...
i wish you would just let them use the device on me .
and then you can go back to earth and you can tell everybody all about solaris .
no .
it' s the only solution that makes any sense .
we could never have a life together on earth , chris .
you know that .
it would be impossible .
and this ?
what kind of life is this ?
trapped here .
it' s not a life .
i don' t know what to call it .
it' s what we have .
it' s enough for me .
you need to rest .
you' re going to make yourself ill .
i don' t care .
just lie down for a moment .
please , chris .
you have to rest .
you know i' m not human so i don' t understand what you' re afraid of .
of course you can use the device .
it' s not murder .
you said that yourself .
you' re the one who had the idea in the first place .
chris doesn' t trust me .
chris , don' t blame gordon .
it' s not her fault .
i begged her to do it .
it' s better this way .
i found the suicide note .
i went through your things .
the page torn from the book of poems .
and i realised
i' m not her .
i' m not rheya .
i know you loved me , though .
i know that .
i felt that .
and i love you .
i wish we could just live inside that feeling forever .
maybe there' s a place where we can .
but i know it' s not on earth .
and it' s not on this ship .
that' s all i can say right now .
you killed her .
not her .
it .
it' s murder .
kelvin , she begged me .
it wasn' t painful .
she' il be back .
no .
why would you let her do it ?
kelvin !
it' s not human .
whatever it is , it' s not human , and i' m threatened by that .
and i wanna win .
i want humans to win .
whose side are you on ?
what are you doing ?
putting the al back online .
i' m going home .
gordon .
i knew it .
how long you think he' s been dead ?
hard to say because of the cold .
he attacked me .
there i am .
somehow , there i am .
and i couldn' t tell you how i' m there , or who i am or what' s going on .
but before i can get to that , what' s this over here ?
comin ' at me .
what are you tryin ' to do ?
oh , i see .
you' re tryin ' to kill me .
yeah , confusing .
i' il tell you somethin ' confusing .
bingo , there you are , and my welcoming committee dropped his knife and it' s good night .
and , by the way , after all that
i find this , whoever this ...
i get my first good look and it happens to be ...
i survive the first 30 seconds of this life , whatever you call it , by killing someone .
and by killing someone who happens to be me .
see , most people ...
i would think most people in this position would be , like " this ...
ah .
i don' t know . " however , this is at least ...
this is an incredible opportunity .
this is ...
what if this is a gift ?
i' m a gift .
hey .
i say we use the higgs device on him .
i don' t think you really have time .
why would you say that ?
well , you know , ever since we used the famous higgs device ,
solaris started taking on mass exponentially .
you might have noticed how we' re a lot closer to it .
that would be because everything within its gravitational field it' s pulling it in .
and , yeah , sorry .
by the way , the higgs device also drained the fuel cell reactors .
can i make a suggestion ?
i mean , this is ...
you can do what you want , but i would just lock me in here really tight and take the athena back .
wear your seat belt .
switch to internal power .
start fuel cell operational diagnostic .
service check on lga .
point and calibrate high beam antenna .
depressurising .
spin all turbines to standby .
disengage coupling interlocks and all docking couplers .
vent and seal all main engine propellant lines .
earth .
even the word sounded strange to me now .
unfamiliar .
how long had i been gone ?
how long had i been back ?
did it matter ?
i tried to find the rhythm of the world where i used to live .
i followed the current .
i was silent and attentive .
i made a conscious effort to smile , nod , stand , and perform the millions of gestures that constitute life on earth .
i studied these gestures until they became reflexes again .
but i was haunted by the idea that i remembered her wrong .
that somehow i was wrong about everything .
depressurising .
spin all turbines to standby .
disengage coupling interlocks and all docking couplers .
vent and seal all main engine propellant lines .
rheya !
rheya ?
chris ?
am i alive or dead ?
we don' t have to think like that any more .
we' re together now .
everything we' ve done is forgiven .
everything .
