he' s dumb as a sack of hammers .
yes , he sure is a character .
where are you headed ?
california .
do you live there ?
a man wants me to sail his boat .
you' re a sailor man ?
that would be the life .
just get on a boat and sail away .
a man could disappear like that .
lf i' d known she was married ...
it wouldn' t have made a difference .
you' re a man without scruples .
i can smell it on you .
yeah , that' s the sweat of a man that hasn' t an honest bone in his body .
don' t be offended .
a man without ethics is a free man .
i envy you .
a woman with her looks and a man my age , what was i to expect ?
women ...
can' t live with them , can' t live without them .
can' t live with them , can' t shoot them .
i bet she had you hard as a rock , wiggling her ass in your face .
you wanted to pull her pants down and hog her out , and then i bust in .
you got a temper .
i bet you just wanted to snap her neck .
i bet you just wanted to kill her .
would you ?
would you kill her ?
why would i kill her ?
i' m sick of her little games .
you could do it and drift away on that boat without being noticed .
i' d love to split the $50, 000 life insurance policy with her murderer .
i' ve done some things , but i' m not a murderer .
how do you know if you' ve never tried ?
you' re joking , right ?
that' s right .
it' s nothing but a joke .
enjoy your stay , lad .
you got a soda ?
habla slowly .
a cold soda .
something to eat .
no , no .
drink .
keep it in you and nobody gets hurt .
the same goes for you , punk .
give me the money .
that' s it ?
lady , i' ve got kids to put through school .
what have you got , pal ?
beautiful .
you' re getting tasty .
give me the pack .
it' s just books .
i' m a reader .
toss it .
it' s personal family things .
give me the bag .
no .
no ?
this is no good .
come on .
no ?
he doesn' t want to give me the bag .
he doesn' t have to .
come on !
not my wedding ring !
extra never hurt .
murderer !
seor , you' re hurt .
i' il call the police .
no .
no police .
here .
no police . $100 , no police ?
no police .
what happened to your face ?
i had an accident .
another accident ?
you' ve got to be more careful .
what the hell happened to my car ?
i had to change your bottom hose too , but it runs like a dream now .
how much ?
let' s see ...
you got parts and labour .
let' s just call it ... $150 .
how much ?
150 .
to replace a radiator hose ?
a hose in a 1964 mustang .
it' s a ford , not a ferrari !
it' s not just a ford .
it' s a 1964 mustang .
what' s that got to do with it ?
i don' t know .
but it' s the reason i' m living here , and you' re just passing through .
you owe me $150 .
i just got rolled .
get out your american express gold card and call the guy on tv ...
i don' t have a credit card .
then you' il have to work this off .
i' ve got a movado .
it' s worth $7, 800 .
you could sell it for that .
i can' t see no numbers .
that' s why it' s expensive !
look at the gold .
no day , no dates .
far as i can tell , this ain' t worth a duck' s fart .
i got this for $3 . 75 .
it' s got lots of doodads .
i' il stick with that .
you son of a bitch !
my lawyer will shut you down .
no credit cards , but a lawyer ?
sweet talk me all you want to , but didn' t you read this sign ?
what sign ?
i want my car .
i want my $150 .
what' s the line on dallas ?

this will sound like a highly improbable story .
i had the money .
i' m on my way to vegas , and my car breaks down .
i go into this store to get some food , and the place gets robbed .
and the robber gets your money ?
there were two , and they got shot .
the old lady shot them .
she kills them , and the money in the bag gets shredded to pieces .
what are the odds ?
so i thought maybe you could ...
can' t you wire me $150 ?
i' d pay it back with the rest .
which you don' t have .
i can sell my carin vegas .
where are you ?
ln this little shithole 200 miles east of phoenix .

ls everyone in this town on drugs ?
i just asked him for a quarter .
shut your mouth .
we' ve got business to take care of .
and i ain' t never taken no drugs .
maybe you should .
i wasn' t trying to make time with your girl .
i' m calling you out .
you want to fight over her ?
you don' t know who i am .
the name' s toby n. tucker .
people call me tnt .
you know why ?
they' re not very imaginative ?
because i' m just like dynamite .
when i go off , somebody gets hurt !
fine .
i tried to make time with your girl .
now i' m terrified , and i' ve learned my lesson , and you can go away .
jesus christ .
stand up .
or i' il beat you where you sit ?
finish your pop and leave him .
don' t you never mind , flo .
this will be over real quick .
one touch toby .
come on , pussy .
you' re real lucky this time .
but i' m going to see this through .
i think i' il make you walk home .
what was that all about ?
toby thinks everyone wants jenny .
it' s jenny who wants every man she sees .
i can' t open off sale for you .
it' s the desert .
it makes people go bonkers .
i' il help myself to some coffee .
you be careful now .
son of a bitch !

i burned my gun hand .
it' s all red .
i' il put butter on it later .

sorry about that , sugar .
let' s see . $3 . 25 .

i' il sure try .
goddamn it !
why ?
get me out of this fucking town .
mckenna realty
jake' s the name , real estate' s my game .
what can i do for you , lad ?
what can i do for you , lad ?
i hoped we could talk .
about what ?
about your wife .
about your $50, 000 life insurance policy .
you' d split it with her murderer .
i think the heat' s getting to you .
you brought it up .
i don' t always mean what i say .
you meant it .
you' re a slimy bastard who' d have his wife killed to get rich .
what does that make you ?
the slimy bastard that' il do it .
you' re a jealous man . lf you can' t have grace to yourself ...
you' re not the sharing kind .
i have what you call a love hate relationship with grace .
you love her , but you hate her .
no , i hate loving her .
i hate having to tolerate the little games she plays .
like fucking half this town behind my back and laughing at me .
bitch !
she wants me to hit her .
she likes it .
she likes to torture me .
but after all ...
she' s my family .
she' s my little girl .
my baby .
i couldn' t stand to watch her as she sucks her last breath .
no .
not me .
but you ...
you' ve got a killing in you .
let' s say i want the bitch dead .
what do you want ?
how do you put a price on murder ?
i put it at $50, 000 minus your cut , of course .
which is ?
20, 000 .
i don' t have that kind of money .
getting the insurance takes time .
how much can you get ?
maybe 10, 000 .
i need 13, 000 .
that' s a bit much .
we' re not talking about buying a car , but about killing your wife .
it' s 13, 000 or it' s nothing .
you drive a hard bargain .
but i had a feeling you were my boy when i first met you .
it looks like we' ve got ourselves a contract .
do we shake hands ?
lf you can' t trust the man you' ve hired to kill your wife ...
it' s got to look like an accident .
lf it don' t , it' s no good .
i' il be a penniless murder suspect while you' re living it up somewhere .
how do you want it ?
it can' t be done at the house .
i want some money up front .
why don' t i buy you a plane ticket while i' m at it ?
i know you .
listen ...
you go to the house to see her .
tell heryou had to see her .
yousweet talk the woman .
a young buck like you mustbe good at that
then shift the conversation .
talk about the jeep .
she loves that
maybe the only thing she does love .
she' il take you fora ride out in the desert someplace quiet
riding through the red rocks and mesas .
she loves it out there .
so do l .
we' ve got that in common .
there won' tbe anyone around butyou andsome prairie dogs .
and then ... sweet talk her .
ltmakes no difference to me .
putherat ease , and then ... ... do it !
you could leave him .
it' s not that easy .
walk away .
maybe you can take chances .
you can wander wherever you please .
i can' t .
i don' t want to be alone .
i wish i was a bird .
some of the old lndians thought you could change into animals .
i wish i could . lf i was a bird , i' d fly to florida .
disneyworld .
i' ve always wanted to go there .
then i' il fly to new york , maybe .
then i' d fly to st. louis and all over texas .
then i' il fly to california .
then i guess i would' ve seen it all .
then i could die .
they say you don' t feel anything .
that the shock kills you before you hit the ground .
i' ve always imagined it' s just like flying .
i bet , right now , you don' t know if you want to kill me ...
... or fuck me .
stop !
i can' t !
what' s the matter ?
nothing .
doesn' t feel like nothing .
get out of town quick , bobby .
don' t do this to me .
i' ve been fucked over by too many women .
you' re the queen of hot and cold .
it' s such a mess with jake .
i know all about being in a mess .
jake was with my mom .
after my real father died .
he used to call me his " little half breed " .
he kept my mom on the side .
he had a wife someplace else .
he' d control me .
you lookso pretty .
putyour arms around me .
why ?
don' t fuck around like your mama .
he was raping me the whole time .
for years .
my mom ...
it tore her up ' cause she couldn' t do nothing about it .
she became an alcoholic .
they found my mama down here .
at the bottom of apache leap .
virgil , sheriff potter , said she was drunk and went insane .
i' d never believe she ran off that cliff by accident .
she was like me .
she just wanted to fly away .
i' m so sorry .
what are you going to ?
life , right ?
have you ever been to california ?
yes .
ls it pretty ?
it' s another world .
it' s beautiful beaches and blue water .
clear sky , as far as the eye can see .
take me with you .
i won' t hang on you .
you can dump me there .
i just want to leave .
i can' t leave before i get hold of the $150 for that crazy mechanic .
darrell ?
he and jake ...
do you have money ?
jake only gives me $20 at a time .
lf you could get money , i could get us out of here .
there' s money .
a lot .
where ?
jake hides it in a safe .
ln the bedroom floor .
my mom said there was more than $100, 000 there .
ln cash ?
there' s nothing else with jake .
he sits there , he laughs , he talks to himself and counts it . $100, 000 ... son of a bitch .
what do you mean ?
we need the combination .
it takes a key .
he keeps it on him all the time .
so it' s slapping up against me when we do it .
then how do we get it ?
kill him .
i can' t kill anybody .
it' s not like he' s a young man .
he had time to live .
it would be quick .
he doesn' t even have to feel it .
do it at night .
come up behind him when he' s asleep .
or when he' s pounding me ...
bobby !
i see it .
it' s in you .
i see death .
it' s in your heart .
do it for me .
i' il do anything for you .
you need the money to get out of here .
it' s three miles back to town .
it' s a lot more than $100, 000 .
where are you going ?
hey , you there !
they' re cursed .
all the miners last century killed off all the lndians at the mine .
earth ran red with blood .
i' ve seen peculiar things on a hot day .
saw a scorpion sting itself to death .
a killer killing itself .
i' ve seen a coyote tear its own leg off before it bled to death .
a white man will get himself killed just rubbing shoulders with another .
kissy , kissy .
nice little pussy there , you see it coming .
that will be the death of him .
you sure see a lot for a blind man .
i' m blind , but i can still see .
we' re all eyes in the same head .
everything is everything .
what ?
everything is nothing too .
maybe one day i' il have time to sit on a corner and spout wise .
think you' il live that long , motherfucker ?
everybody' s got a mother .
you don' t rip up the mother .
it' s like popcorn .
the more you eat , the more you want .
i' ve got things to do .
you don' t see me stopping you .
ain' t you got anything for the sick ?
sorry .
i' il catch you next time .
you tell your lies pretty good .
hi .
patsy cline .
i just wanted to thank you .
for what ?
for defending my honour .
i wasn' t defending your honour .
you were going to fight for me .
i was gonna pound your boyfriend .
he ain' t my boyfriend .
i let him take me out , but i ain' t spoken for .
not yet , that is .
i ain' t going for you .
marry toby .
you won' t do any better in this town .
that' s what i thought till you came .
i saw your car at the gas station .
that' s a cool car .
do you want to take me for a ride ?
no , i don' t .
i just want ...
you wouldn' t have $150 ...
shit .
i told you it wasn' t over .
you' re at it again with my girl !
no , i' m not .
tell him .
you' re too late .
we' re riding off in his car .
what ?
what' s your name ?
that tears it .
i' m going to bust you up for good .
i' il break you in a million pieces and break them into a million more !
you don' t know me .
i' m psycho crazy !
yes , you' re tnt and when you go off somebody gets hurt .
it don' t matter if you beat him up , because we love each other .
i want to have his love child .
would you shut up !
you' re going to pay for that .
come on .
toby !
sheriff potter ...
your poor mama hasn' t seen you since this morning .
i was just home for lunch .
i want to see smoke coming out of your ass on your way home !
bye !
don' t go nowhere without me .
i want to have your love child .
where are you going ?
up to harlin' s .
get in .
there was a young fellow up at jamilla' s today when it got hit .
she says he got whacked by one of the robbers .
i wish i could help you .
i just want to get up to harlin' s and get out of town quickly .
that' s a nasty cut .
i fell on a rock .
it' s not as bad as it looks .
everything all right ?
yes .
where are you going ?
just up at darrell' s .
so how' s the wife ?
ls the little eskimo baby walking ?
yes , just fine .
have you seen my wife ?
i' m looking for her .
no , but if i see her , i' il tell her you' re looking for her .
what have you got there ?
some trash ?
kind of peculiar how things happen .
a man' s car breaks down .
there' s a robbery , people get killed .
all that money ...
and now ...
now old jake is out looking for his young wife .
and then you show up .
time' s running out , son .
i' il be seeing you in the morning .
hey there , bud .
i started to think you wasn' t coming back .
feel like you' re running in circles without getting anywhere ?
you' ve been there ?
you just have to tough it out .
you believe that ?
lf you think bad , you get bad .
that' s a decent philosophy .

i want to get out of here , and i want to take you with me .
i thought you couldn' t get your car .
i could if i had jake' s money .
did the money change your mind ?
no , i want to leave with you .
are you sure ?
i came back for you .
i want you .
i stormed off because you spooked me talking about jake .
i' ve realised it all comes back to us getting out of here .
we have to get the money .

but you couldn' t kill anybody .
i would do it for you , grace .
so you can fly .
fly away like a bird .
grace ...
grace ...
grace ?
after dark .
i' il leave the back door unlocked .
who was that ?
wrong number .
you took a long time talking for the wrong number .
but then , you make friends so easily , don' t you , grace ?
you look like your mama , standing there in the afternoon light .
what are you looking at ?
nothing , jake .
absolutely nothing .
that' s it .
sun' s going down .
regular people go home .
sit around a nice dinner table .
they trade stories about the day , the heat , maybe tell a little joke .
then they kiss ... ... sleep , wake up and do it all over again .
the day was all right .
we all got through it .
no , keep it .
the day ain' t over yet .
night is part of day .
you see things in the shadows , and you hear things in the dark .
you afraid of the dark ?
boy , i live in the dark .
and all because of a woman .
want some ?
people fear what they can' t see .
i see nothing , so it doesn' t matter .
a kiss from a beautiful woman , a lick from a dog , the kiss of death .
it' s all the same to me now .
we' re all floating like sticks in a stream .
just enjoy the ride , huh ?
that' s about it .
not me .
i' ve got plans .
that makes the great spirit laugh .
we all got plans .
i planned on seeing all my life .
you never planned on coming here .
i don' t plan on sticking around .
i was a smart ass too .
i got smart with the wrong man' s daughter .
i got acid poured on my peepers for my trouble .
human beings ain' t only human .
they got animals inside them too .
i hope she was worth it .
she was worth it .
worth every black minute since .
time' s up , old one .
got any last minute words of wisdom ?
things ain' t always what they seem .
ask yourself : ls it worth it ?
because one day earthmaker will come down , look right in your heart .
you better know what you' re doing .
are you a human being orjust some hungry ghost ?
you' re crazy .
i' il be seeing you .
i won' t be seeing you .
cheap bastard .
gave me back my own change .
come on , jesse .
we' re going for a walk .
nice air outside , huh ?
you coming to bed , or aren' t you ?
you fuck around like your mama , but you always come home to daddy .
because you know daddy' s the best .
you' ve been a bad girl , right ?
please forgive me , papa .
fuck it away .
but it won' t go away .
because your mama won' t leave you alone .
you broke her heart when you stole me .
you' ve been a bad girl , bitch .

i didn' t mean to hit you so hard .
it just got away .

but it' s her you should worry about .
she wants you dead .
she wants your money .
what are you babbling about ?
how do you think i got in ?
did you hear glass break ?
did you hear any door shatter ?
did she linger long enough to leave the door open before coming to bed ?
you' d say anything to get off .

you know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of superior .
what is she to you ?
a woman who wants you dead .

i' ve dreamed about going there and lying on the beach ,
letting the water lick up against my toes .
i' d kill to go there .

i thought you' d left me .
what do you mean ?
when the jeep wasn' t there , i thought you' d left with the money .
i' ve never had much luck with women .

i thought you were just like them .
when you came out of that house ...
well , you' re here .

virgil , stop .

did you get the story about wanting to be a little bird flying away ?
were you going to help her fly away ?
grace , get back !
did she tell you the story about how jake forced her to marry him ?
and how he killed her crazy mother ?
i bet she didn' t tell you one story .

grab him further up .
bend your knees and swing him .

my hand is bothering me .
we' ve got to burn this .
you think , now that jake' s dead , and i' ve got all the money ,
that one day i' il just ... pop !
don' t you think i would' ve done it by now if i wanted to ?
what can i do to make you feel more relaxed ?
you could give me my gun back .
let' s just finish what we started .
what happens to people' s spirits when they die ?
nothing .
they' re dead meat , that' s it .
you don' t believe in anything ?
i believe in this moment .
you want to help me with him ?
he must be 300 pounds .
you hit me !
you hit me , bobby .

i was baiting him , like when you told jake you' d kill me .
try mexico .
with all that bread you' d live like a queen .
i don' t want to go to mexico .
i want to stay with you .
don' t you think i care about you ?
you' re a lying , back stabbing , psycho bitch who' il kill me one day .
but it' s nice to know you care .
it' s good to split here .
it' il take them months to find the body .
we' ve got to get out of arizona .
remember .
no body , no crime .
we' il dump the car in phoenix .
you' il find someone else .
there' s always hope with $100, 000 .
hope' s a four letter word .

grace , help !
i' m sorry i hit you .

bobby , i can' t do this alone .
pull yourself together .
i' m not going to leave you .
i never wanted it to go down like this .
it was different with you , bobby .
you had dreams , like me .
we could still make this work .
i didn' t want to hurt you .
right here .
you know why else i can never leave you ?
because i love you , grace .
i love you , bobby .
i don' t know whether to love you or kill you !
i love you , grace , but i can' t trust you .
