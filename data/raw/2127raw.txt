don' t look at me that way !
what happened to your mother had nothing to do with me .

you said you' d come back !

that' s what she said ?
that' s a female lie .
that' s bullshit !
i found your letters and read them after she did it !

officers aren' t like you and me .

when i say " understand " , i want the group to say , " yes , sir !
understand ?
yes , sir !
understand ?

i know why most of you are here .
i' m not stupid .
before you get to sell what we teach you over at united airlines , got to give the navy six years of your life , sweet pea .
lots of things can happen in six years .
another war could come up .
if you' re too peaceful a person to napalm an enemy village , where there are women and children , i' m going to find that out .
understand ?
yes , sir !
understand ?
yes , sir !
hi , son .

you want to fuck me ?
that' s why you called me a ewe ?
are you a queer ?

there' s a notch for every college puke like you that i got to dor .
that' s drop on request from this program .
the first one i' m going to call out of this class is you , emiliano .
i expect to lose half of you before i' m finished .
i will use every means necessary , fair and unfair , to trip you up , to expose your weaknesses as a potential aviator and as a human being , understand ?
yes , sir !
the price at the other end is a flight education worth $1 million !
but first , you got to get past me !
hey , paula !
it' s 5 : 00 !
where' s the goddamn whistle ?
oh , shit !
come on , paula .
let' s go !

this is my idea of an ass bandit .
wait till the girls see you , scrotumhead .
scrotumhead !
think that' s funny , don' t you , boy ?
not all the obstacles that can trip you up are on this base .
let me tell you something about the local girls .
ever since there' s been a base here , there' s been what you' d call the puget sound debs .
the poor girls come across the sound on the ferry every weekend with just one thing in mind , and that' s to marry themselves a naval aviator .
a puget deb will tell you ,
don' t you worry about contraceptives .
i' ve got that all taken care of .
don' t believe it , sweet pea .
a puget deb will do anything and say anything to trap you .
i know this sounds silly , especially in this so called modern age , but you scuzzy college pukes should watch out , because they' re out there , and you , sweet peas , are the answer to their dream !

when you hit the water , you might get the wind knocked out of you .
don' t panic .
you' ve got a second and a half before the cage is completely underwater and upside down .
go , joe !
now , the most important thing is to watch your bubbles .
when that cage flips upside down , you' il be disoriented .
you won' t know what your bearings are , like perryman down there .
the bubbles determine which way is up .
all right , time' s up .
go down for him .
this is what happens if you panic .
you can die there , and this is a pool .
out in the pacific , you won' t have a frogman to save your ass .
totally unsatisfactory , perryman .

casey jones was a son of a bitch !
drove his train in a 30 foot ditch !
came on out with his dick in his hand
said , " listen , ladies , i' m a hell of a man .
went to his room and lined up 100 .
swore up and down he' d fuck every one .
fucked 98 till his balls turned blue .
then he backed off , jacked off , and fucked the other two !
wave goodbye to your buddies .
i forgot .
you don' t have buddies .
only customers .
you having fun , mayonnaise ?
yes , sir !
don' t hear you !
yes , sir !
all right !
98 ...
99 ...
get your face all the way down in there !
100 .
ready to quit now , mayo ?
no , sir !
look over there , mayo .
look at her .
she decided to stay instead of taking liberty this weekend .
she may not make it , but she' s got more heart and character than you' il ever have !
and stop eyeballing me , boy !
life' s dealt you some shitty cards , hasn' t it ?
i' m doing all right , sir !
6 ...
bullshit .
i done some checking .
i looked through your files .
i know about your mama .
don' t you eyeball me .
i know your father' s an alcoholic and a whore chaser .
that' s why you don' t mesh , mayo .
because deep down ...
don' t you eyeball me , boy !
deep down inside ... you know the others are better than you !
isn' t that right , mayo ?
no , sir !
no , sir !
what' s the matter ?
you getting tired ?
i' m not tired .
move it , boy !
this is where the fun starts !
move it !
you got all day tomorrow to look forward to !
6 inches off the ground .
give me 6 to 90 .
hey , mayo , why don' t we quit this little charade over a couple of beers at tj' s ?
you' re as close to being officer material as me .
this candidate believes he would make a good officer !
you only give a shit about yourself .
all your classmates know it .
do you think they would trust you behind the controls of a plane ?
you' d probably zipp off in my f 14 and sell it to the cubans .
no , sir !
no , sir !
i love my country .
sell it to the air force , mayo .
why would a slick hustler like you sign up for this abuse ?
i want to fly jets .
my grandmama wants to fly jets .
i' ve always wanted it !
we' re not talking about flying .
we' re talking about character .
i' ve changed , sir .
the hell you have .
i' ve changed , sir !
you' ve just polished your act .
you' ve shined it up !
tell me what i want to hear .
i want your dor .
i ain' t going to quit .
spell it !
d o r. i ain' t gonna quit !
then you and your daddy can get drunk and go whore chasing together !
no , sir !
i ain' t going to quit !
then forget it .
you' re out !
don' t you do it !
don' t ... you ...
i got nowhere else to go !
i got nowhere else to go !
i ain' t got nothing else .
i got nothing else .
all right , mayo .
on your feet .
come on , mayo , let' s get back to the barracks .
hey , foley !
zack , don' t give up !
you got that queer on the run !
kiss this , foley !
hang in there , zack !
remember the tides lnn .
those friends of yours ?
don' t give up , mayo !
yes , sir .
we' re with you , zack !
zack , you can make it !
you got some urinals to clean .
move out .
hey , foley' s queer !
he got his balls shot off in the war !
you' re still here , mayo ?
sid .
yeah ?
thanks .
sid .
look at that .
that son of a bitch .
want me to get a towel ?
i' il get one .
i don' t want you to move .
somebody' s got to move sometime ... eventually .
they found them there weeks later ,
shrivelled from lack of food and water .
bye , zachary .
i laughed all week , thinking about you guys on that boat .
we were so drunk .
pretty sharp , paula .
pretty sharp .
i' d love to be one of those girls they' re letting in the flight programme .
it would be a gas to fly .
what' s stopping you ?
you know what those magazines say .
it' s just ...
i don' t know .
it' s not so easy for a girl .
that' s still no excuse for not getting what you want .
just go get it .
who says i' m not going after what i want ?
not me .
my mama' s 39 years old .
she still works over at that factory .
every time i look at her , i know exactly what i don' t want .
my old lady ... took a bottle of pills one day when i was at school .
oh , god .
the thing that got me about it ...
she didn' t leave a note .
she didn' t ...
nothing .
she just checked out .
i always hated her for that .
oh , god .
that must really hurt .
hurt ?
no .
no .
you' re all alone in the world .
once you got that down , nothing hurts anymore .
i bet most people buy that line when you feed it to them .
hey , are you really serious about having him over ?
i haven' t made up my mind yet .
paula ... just how far would you go to get zack ?
what do you mean ?
you know what i mean .
would you let yourself get pregnant ?
no way , lynette .
would you ?
well ... l never used to think i' d do something like that .
but i don' t know anymore .
nine weeks just ain' t long enough for a guy to fall in love with you .
that doesn' t justify trapping him or getting pregnant .
i can' t believe you' d think that .
it' s real backward .
it ain' t any more backward than the way these hotshot assholes use us till they' ve had enough , then ditch us like we' s trash .
don' t you ever feel used , paula ?
don' t you feel the sons of bitches ought to be paying for our troubles ?
no .
i never feel like that .
well , i do .
thanks again for the flowers , zack .
it was my pleasure .
those are the most beautiful things i' ve ever saw .
wipe that stuff off your mouth .
zack ?
this is great .
sir ?
how many more weeks till graduation ?
three more .
three more weeks .
those are the roughest , aren' t they ?
that' s what they tell me .
sir , why are you staring at my food ?
or are you staring at me ?
staring at you .
he doesn' t mean anything by it .
do you , joe ?
no , i don' t mean anything by it .
like some more chicken , zack ?
no .
no , thanks .
i' ve had it .
i can' t eat another bite .
i' m stuffed , too .
this is the best meal i' ve had in a long time .
let' s go , zack .
thank you , mama .
thank you , zack .
thanks again , ma' am .
go on and eat .
mama , mama , mama !
i' m sorry .
i' m so embarrassed , zack .
i shouldn' t have brought you here .
that' s ok .
a great free meal .
a nice , relaxing dinner .
those people are so uptight .
i felt so sorry for you .
don' t .
i' m used to it .
it' s hereditary .
after this , you go to basic flight which is in pensacola , right ?
yeah , pensacola .
and ... going to beeville , texas , when i get jets .
so , after that ... don' t you think about ...
i mean , come on ...
what' s after that ?
family , kids ...
don' t you think about all that ?
no .
is that what you think about ?
sometimes .
if i could do a better job than them , i' d love it .
and what would you do different ?
everything .
first , i' d marry a man i really loved .
so why did your mom marry this guy if she didn' t love him ?
my real father wouldn' t marry her .
your real father ?
my real father .
i want to show you my real father .
pop .
your real father was an officers candidate like me ?
about 22 years ago .
jesus .
no wonder this guy was looking at me funny .
he always looks funny .
it' s about time i got back to the wars .
yeah , i know , i know .
thank your mom for dinner , ok ?
great chicken , huh ?
i loved the chicken .
if you get a chance , why don' t you call me ?
i have survival training this week , so i can' t make any promises .
no promises .
i didn' t have to show you that picture if i didn' t want to .
i wanted to tell you that .
i know .
bye , baby .
be careful on that .
yeah .
you and paula still seeing those flight candidates ?
any reason we wouldn' t be ?
it' s 3 : 40 and you haven' t said what you' re doing this weekend .
hi .
i' d like to speak with zack mayo .
he' s an aoc candidate .
could you look for him ?
tell him it' s paula .
liberty time , boys and girls .

seeger , don' t forget tj' s .
i won' t .
hey , mayo !
you got a phone call .
somebody named paula .
tell her i already split .
i see .
ok .
comes a time right after survival training , they start thinking they can make it without you .
suddenly , they stop calling .
suddenly , they own the goddamn world .
they said that he already left .
i don' t think he did .
he hasn' t called by now , he won' t call .
bunny , just shut up !
you don' t know so much .
clock me out , lynette .
paula , what are you doing ?
may they all crash and burn .
paula , wait !
where are you going ?
let me go , mama .
you' re going to look for zack .
don' t do it .
i love him .
i can' t let him go .
how will you stop him ?
i don' t know , but i' il think of a way .
no !
no ?
i can' t let you do this .
don' t go .
please , don' t go .
what are you crying about ?
cos i know what you' re feeling !
what am i feeling ?
don' t do it .
let him go .
don' t trick him or trap him .
i wouldn' t do that .
i' d never try to trap him .
if you find him , you' il say anything .
you will .
and god help you after that .
mama , you' re right .
daddy , zack' s 2/ 10 of a second off the obstacle course record .
he' il break it before he leaves .
lucky you weren' t in the programme when i was .
you couldn' t quit the way you can now .
when i and my oldest boy went through it , you bilged out , you became a swabby .
that' s real interesting , sir .
how come you haven' t written susan in over three weeks ?
we haven' t had time to write anybody .
i' ve only written y' all once .
it' s incredible .
right ?
yeah .
who is this susan ?
my girl back home .
i' m marrying her as soon i get out of here .
she was tommy' s girl .
they were supposed to get married before he got killed .
i didn' t want you to think i was a shit for fucking lynette .

sid ... l' ve really got to go .
shouldn' t you have got your period by now ?
i' m a little late , that' s all .
how late are you ?
why ?
what' s the difference ?
if anything happened , it would be my responsibility .
now , just exactly how late are you ?
what do you care ?
suppose i was to get pregnant .
just suppose .
i' d never make you do something you didn' t want to do .
i know .
but that' s not the only issue here .
there' s more to it than that .
what other issue is there , sid ?
my responsibility as its father , for one thing .
if i' ve got you pregnant , i' il do the right thing by you .
i' il pay for the abortion , be with you through it , comfort you .
we' d go through it together .
so how late are you ?
let' s just wait and see what happens , ok ?

i' il call you .

where' s sid ?
what makes you think she' s not lying ?
she went to a doctor .
she' s pregnant .
so get an abortion .
i' d love to , believe me .
she won' t even talk about it .
she' s catholic .
you' re not marrying this girl .
if i don' t , she' il have the baby on her own somewhere .
women do it all the time .
i can' t let her have a kid by herself .
it' s my kid , too .
you sure ?
it' s mine .
i' m sorry , all right ?
what if foley was right ?
she got knocked up to trap you .
is it still your responsibility ?
that' s not the point .
no matter how it happened , the child would still be mine .
i wouldn' t know where it was or nothing .
jesus christ !
ls everything your responsibility ?
sit .
adjust .
pray .
attack .
it' s like your brother getting killed .
it' s the same damn thing him getting killed instead of you .
that' s why you promised to marry susan .
you do everything out of some bullshit code of ethics .
it may be bullshit to you , but i wasn' t raised that way !
we' re responsible for the people in our lives .
that' s all that separates us from the animals !
i' m not like you , mayo .
i can' t shit on people and sleep at night .
i say you' re responsible to yourself first .
if you can' t handle that , you got bigger problems than making some girl pregnant !
gentlemen , relax .
without an oxygen mask at 30, 000 feet , your insides will feel like this rubber glove .
your coordination deteriorates .
even the most childlike exercises seem impossible .
look for the warning signs giddiness , shortness of breath , claustrophobia .
they can hit you at any moment .
the instant you feel yourself losing control , go back on oxygen .
that' s the purpose of this drill .
does everyone understand the exercises ?
ok , everybody set ?
let' s see a thumbs up , please .
very good .
everybody remove your mask , please .
all right .
begin the exercises now .

he' s ok .
colours !
secure the halyard !
charlie , take care of that .
what' s going on ?
you didn' t kick him out ?
did he tell you what he' s been going through ?
it doesn' t matter .
what does matter is that he freaked out at 25, 000 feet .
that can' t happen ever .
he' s got a girl who' s pregnant .
that don' t matter .
don' t matter ?
you' ve got two weeks left !
that can happen to you , too , mayonnaise .
he ain' t bullshitting you , buddy .
i' m talking to you , motherfucker !
don' t fuck for you !
what did you call me ?
i thought the dl' s were supposed to help .
what kind of a human being are you ?
lock it up or you' il go with him .
go back to the barracks .
please ?
i don' t get this .
he' s the best candidate in the class !
the best student , the best leader ... the best friend to everybody .
can' t you bend your goddamn rules ?
he didn' t ask me to dor .
i went to him .
what are you talking about ?
i' m glad it' s over .
i was here for everybody but me .
i was here for my big brother .
hey , buddy .
