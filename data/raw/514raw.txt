come !
my mission is to protect the princess .
draw .
let' s both fulfill our missions .

your highness !
28 feb 2005 .
i had the same dream from months ago .
this time ...
i' m an ancient general ,
leading a vast army to rescue ... some sort of princess .
i fell off a cliff ...
william ?
you' re back in hong kong ?
great !
come on over !
talk about being all at sea !
how come you live on a barge ?
the research budget was halved last year .
with the project unfinished ,
i had to sell the flat .
so i moved here with my study .
it' s not so bad !
pretty roomy here .
so why are you back suddenly ?
didn' t like the states ?
i came to solve your financial problems .
can l ?
i want you to do something for me .
william !
this must be dr chan .
just call me jack .
i' m maggie welcome to our anti gravity research project .
anti gravity ?
this is my lab .
check it out .
let' s ask dr smith to give a little demonstration .
doctor , please .
it' s a well known fact that spinning an object at increased speed can reduce its weight , and we can already show the results .
these are very expensive experiments .
quite impractical , and unusable on living subjects , as no living creature can survive such speed .
thank you , maggie .
you' re welcome .
i don' t understand .
you' re a physicist ,
i' m an archaeologist .
how can i help you ?
i m seeking a breakthrough in the field of mysterious phenomena . at paper you wrote ?
over 2000 years ago there was a tiny kingdom south of dasar , whose king became immortal after death .
his coffin floated in mid air . your paper inspired me .
it' s just a myth .
i can even lend you comic books about this .
lots of things are called myths prior to empirical verification .
hey , jack ...
wireless telephony was a myth 150 years ago .
so was the airplane , and landing on the moon !
even 50 years ago , computer and digital technology were a myth .
many people are competing to develop this technology .
if i succeed , i' il change human history ...
this technology could be vital to our lives , to surface and air transportation , even inter galactic travel !
i know you' ve always wanted to do something great .
no one' s ever entered this ancient tomb before .
but my work is archaeology , and i have my ethic ,
i do research , not raid tombs .
you still can' t forget that incident after all these years ?
something you' il never forget .
we haven' t played for ages .
how' s your game ?
jack .
don' t you practice anymore ?
sure !
i just never shot from this angle before .
so why shoot ?
because you passed it to me .
don' t worry about it .
come on .
that maggie is your girlfriend ?
no .
she represents my sponsor .
by the way , what happened to monica ?
monica ?
forget her .
i' ve been dreaming about a princess .
her name' s ok soo .
i called out her name in my sleep .
how do you think monica took it ?
now back to business .
jack , you' ve never been a stickler for rules .
you' ve always trusted your instincts .
instincts helped you unravel the dead sea scrolls forgery ...
jack , hey ...
jack !
jack , do as your instincts tell you .
i want to prove it' s not a myth , but something real .
you' re my best friend .
i trust you won' t let me face danger alone .
ever tried hitting a golf shot like this ?
jack !
what' s with you ?
i think i' ve got heat stroke .
almost there .
come on !
don' t lie to me now .
you should exercise more regularly .
i do !
3 hours of golf each day , 2 hours of tennis ...
and another dozen hours a day playing video games , you' il go blind in no time .
if you' re so fit why don' t you carry me ? you can walk .
hurry up .
we won' t get in if we' re late !
jack that' s the holy man who can fly ?
yes .
let' s go over there .
he really can fly ...
get up .
follow me .
hey , up , up .
hurry .
give me a hand .
grab hold of my leg !
you' ve got strong legs .
let go !
wow !
nice stone carvings !
you have no idea how many stories they tell .
i didn' t come this far on my last expedition .
jack !
the stone coffin' s just floating there .
zoom in and see if it' s suspended by wire .
i m working on it already .
jack , there' s a sword beside the coffin .
i can see it .
i think the inscription records his deeds .
mission to qin ?
this prince once brought treasures and women to qin .
the qin emperor gifted him one of his concubines , but he picked the emperor s favourite .
the emperor reneged and gave him her painting instead , as well as the qin star gem in apology .
the prince even fought a bout with qin' s greatest warrior , and exchanged sword with him
hey !
don' t !
what ?
jack !
are you all right ?
what did you just move ?
i' ve never seen stones like these .
i want some for research .
i told you not to steal anything !
i was going to return it afterwards .
it almost costs me my life !
how come the coffin fell as soon as i pulled it out ?
his majesty commanded me ... to paint a portrait of concubine li as a gift to the prince of dasar . ' t smile , how can i paint ?
i' ve not seen her smile since she arrived .
general meng !
excellent !
that' s the smile !
jack !
stop dreaming !
i hear footsteps !
quick !
lift it up !
why don' t you ask them to help ?
jack !
help me !
hey !
let go !
who are you ?
why come and desecrate our sacred temple ?
what do you gain by this ?
i just came in to look for something ,
i didn' t mean to wreck the coffin , it was an accident .
sorry !
are you all right ?
i was apologizing .
how was i to know ?
i was just trying to help .
let' s go !
told you not to steal !
it' s for protection .
let' s go jack !
look , i took the painting for you as well .
what ?
run .
get them !
jack .
wait .
come on .
get up .
let' s go .
get him , get them all !
jack !
didn' t you say you had backup ?
all i see are monkeys !
you get on board first .
jack !
pick up some stones !
it is too dangerous , we have to leave now .
come on !
jack !
fly a bit lower !
no !
we are hit !
we must go .
come on up !
jack !
jack !
go and catch him !
thank god !
concubine li !
concubine li ...
your highness forgive my lapse in your protection .
halt !
lay down your sword , or i' il kill her .
don' t !
if only one can live , i' d rather it be you .
drop it !
general !
general meng yi !
don' t help me ...
i' m beneath your station .
why do you risk your life for me ?
a blade is forged to drink the blood of enemies .
i am like a blade , destined to fight for his majesty , and die for my country .
you are now concubine li of qin .
protecting you is my duty .
your highness has suffered a fright .
with you beside me i' m not afraid of anything .
we cannot stay here .
we must leave quickly .
lakchume ... don' t be naughty .
good boy , good boy , lakchume .
lakchume ?
where are you going ?
oh my god .
it' s a body .
lakchume , hurry up .
lakchume , pick up the body .
easy easy ...
be careful ... be careful , good boy .
how are you feeling now ?
much better .
thank you .
how did i get here ? you were injured very badly , the flow of the river brought you here .
where' s my ...
sword ?
come with me .
this way .
what is this place ?
this is the birthplace of the dasar martial arts .
it has a history of 3, 000 years .
my uncle , he is a master of the 275th generation .
there he is .
i heard you made the news in dasar .
i am so sorry to have caused so much trouble . you wrecked the coffin of a dasar king !
but you also broke the 2, 000 year old myth of dasar .
for generations now , the locals don' t understand spiritual training .
all they understand is to genuflect before those levitating holy men .
today they have learnt at least one thing spiritual training is not about raising your head and looking up . it is about lowering your head and learn humility and honesty .
young man , i know why you came .
this is no ordinary sword .
is it yours ?
guothum .
the sword is not mine and i didn' t come to fight .
i just came to find some answers
fight for your answers .
young man ... young man
now do you have the answer in your heart ?
you can become one with your sword !
it must be a bond from lifetimes ago .
master , do you really believe in past lives ?
which life is a past life ; and which life is present life ?
what is an illusion , and what is real ?
i always dream of an ancient general and a princess ,
i don' t know if this has anything to do with me .
and i don' t even know if the things in my dream really happened .
yesterday i saw the picture of the princess inside a tomb .
this is the first time my dream was reflected in reality .
master , i am really confused .
a dream may seem amazing and without reason , but it can explain reality .
dreams are made of your imagination and creativity , and your memories of reality .
that' s why they seem so imaginary and yet so real .
because you always dream of one person , it could be a sign that ... the memories locked deep into your heart are getting released .
memories ?
what should i do ?
who is he ?
what is he trying to tell me ?
only you can find the answer you need .
meng yi ...
general meng yi !
general , come in .
meng yi ...
meng yi ?
general meng yi ?
you promised to protect me .
you can' t die !
meng yi ?
meng yi ?
meng yi ...
i have nothing left in this world , not even a relative .
please don' t abandon me !
i have nothing left but you .
please don' t leave me alone !
general meng yi .
over here quickly .
this is the first time i' ve felt so free .
no courtly rites and regulations .
what a beautiful feeling !
this is the first time i' ve seen your highness smile .
why don' t you look at me ? your humble servant does not dare .
don' t say such things .
don' t take away this feeling ...
i' il stop calling you general .
how' s that , meng yi ?
i want to dance .
shall i dance for you ?
no , your highness .
you mustn' t .
in this world , only the emperor himself may watch .
this is a dance for you alone .
please , your highness .
we have reached the great wall .
this is entirely our realm .
our capital xianyang is just over the hill .
you are now safe , concubine li .
i have accomplished my mission finally .
no !
i don' t want to go to xianyang .
take me away !
take me anywhere !
i only want to be with you !
i don' t want to marry the emperor !
why did we struggle to stay alive . just to become slaves to destiny ?
when will we ever be free ?
not until the day we die ?
ok soo ...
concubine li ... your highness , please calm down . don' t forget your own mission .
you must live for the sake of your people .
only with life is there hope .
promise me , you must live !
you would have me live in such agony ?
very well !
i promise you !
i' il live for you !
jack !
the police are after you !
what ?
that' s him !
we have to get out of here , come here , come with me .
come with me !
jack !
put it down !
put it down !
oh my god !
let' s go !
this way .
why are you helping him ?
did you help him to break into the temple ?
you !
freeze !
wow what ?
wow means you are very good .
this way , jack !
don' t jump !
no !
no what ?
never mind .
what are you doing ?
helping you .
jack .
jack .
jack , help me !
jack , help me !
jack , help me .
give me your hands !
jump !
come on !
wait !
what ?
sorry .
let' s go !
along the river for two days , it will take you to china .
thank you so much .
will i ever see you again ?
i will definitely come back to see you and your master .
take care .
i m levitating !
we' ve examined it by every means from spectroscope to mrl .
what is unbelievable is ... that its atomic spectra ... didn' t remotely match any known material on earth , including the spectra measured by the icarus project .
this particular spectra was in one of the last transmissions . before the detector flew out of the solar system .
mid air coffee break !
however if the light emitted from the stone gets blocked , it would be functionless .
maggie !
don' t !
hello ?
jack our project has succeeded ...
well , almost !
what ?
it' s a meteorite ?
from outside our solar system ?
that' s right .
we must now find the rest of them .
where' s the painting from the coffin ?
it' s here with me .
i m going to xian .
meet me there .
bring the painting wlth you .
good , bye for now .
i m coming with you .
it' s forged around the qin dynasty .
the scale like surface material is found only in qin dynasty artifacts .
looking at the design and decorations ,
i' d say it belonged to a qin general .
this is a national treasure !
be careful .
what are you doing ?
the sword is ours !
jack has bequeathed it to our museum .
our foundation financed this project .
anything found should belong to the foundation .
how can you donate the sword to the museum ?
the sword' s a grade one national relic .
it belongs to all of humanity .
it' s only right we return it to the world via the museum .
anyway what' s key to the project are the meteorites .
these two artifacts have nothing to do with them .
before my experiments draw a conclusion , anything may prove to be a critical link .
how can you prejudge it by saying otherwise ?
my experiments will benefit all mankind .
artifacts are old , dead things .
they have no life , no future !
what science is concerned with is precisely the future !
fine , if that' s what you say , then how come these 2000 year old artifacts are so important to you ?
i risked my life for that sword !
that was me !
ok !
in that case , when i find the meteorites , you' il still give them away ?
yes .
as long as it' s someone else' s artifacts i' il return them .
no one can plunder relics from someone else' s country and put them in their own museums .
they call it ' safe keeping ' but it' s theft .
it' s despicable behavior .
so what are we going to do now ?
what can i do ?
william .
do you want to meet your sponsor for the last 10 years ?
of course !
but he doesn' t want to see me !
i' il bring you to him now .
right now ?
come with me .
i' il return these relics to dasar for you .
thank you .
professor koo ?
it' s you ?
it' s been years since i was a professor .
mr koo you' ve been funding my work all these years ?
that' s right .
i had my eye on you even before you graduated .
maggie , cancel my contract with the foundation .
i won' t accept sponsorship from a tomb raiding ' archaeologist ' !
and you and jack weren' t raiding tombs in dasar ?
i' ve unearthed many treasures in my lifetime , but the best ones i found are you and jack .
don' t you hate him ?
no .
even if he has hurt me deeply .
so what do you want from me ?
stay with jack .
enlighten him .
he' il make you the world' s greatest scientist .
isn' t that your life' s dream ?
the 36th year of the emperor' s reign .
star fell on eastern province , turned to stone on earth .
the meteorite was engraved with a curse on the emperor .
so the emperor tried to kill everyone around him ... to keep the secret of the meteorite .
look !
general nangong' s returned !
out of the way !
report to the general at once !
how is my father ?
how is his majesty ?
report !
general nangong has returned with important intelligence .
well how is his majesty ?
his majesty' s ...
general , the immortal pill is ready .
on his way back with it , general xu was ambushed by rebels .
prepare the troops for departure .
yes , sir .
fresh horses !
yes sir !
if word gets out , your whole clan will be executed ! your servant wouldn' t dare !
please tell the chancellor ,
i don' t know anything .
i' il never tell !
i ... don' t know anything .
please assure the chancellor ...
father had too many people around him .
i fear for our plans .
the concubines are ready to be entombed with him .
your majesty , the immortal pill is ready , but was taken in a rebel ambush . your servant begs leave to go retrieve it forthwith !
general meng , your duty is his majesty' s safety you should stay ... ation is most urgent !
i await his majesty' s decree .
his majesty commands general meng ... to retrieve the pill !
as ordered !
wait !
his majesty has few troops in his entourage .
if you go all out for the pill , and the rebels strike ,
i fear for his majesty' s safety .
in that case i' il only take the light cavalry .
i won' t tell !
his majesty still needs treatment !
let me try once more !
general meng yi !
farewell , your highness . you must come back !
the pill can save his majesty' s life , and therefore yours too .
yi swears , my heart is yours forever .
i await your return .
attention , soldiers of the meng clan !
those with aged parents are excused !
the only sons are excused !
husbands and fathers are excused !
those who are excused guard the camp !
the rest of you , mount !
general !
how many years have we shared our honor ?
why can we not live and die together now ?
nangong yan swears to follow you even unto death !
we swear to follow the general ! ...
i have orders from the chancellor to take the pill .
failure to hand it over is disobedience , xu gui !
i can only give the pill to general meng , but no one else .
the chancellor bears his majesty' s word .
obey or die !
prepare to attack !
prepare to attack !
defenses !
ready archers !
shoot !
charge !
attack !
zhao kuang his majesty orders !
yield at once !
you dare fake an imperial decree ?
general meng ?
leave none alive !
general zhao , general meng comes with an imperial decree !
why do you disobey ? your disobedience in the field will be punished !
attack !
soldiers at the back !
no one moves without my orders !
attack !
xu gui !
general meng !
meng jie ?
the chancellor wants you dead .
behind my troops is the only way out .
general , there' s no time !
you go with meng jie .
i' il hold them off .
go !
after them !
out of the way !
out of the way !
my bow !
out of the way !
everyone out of the way !
go !
hurry !
go !
black wind !
archers , ready !
shoot !
shoot !
general !
take the pill and go !
general !
the pill must reach the emperor !
protect concubine li !
general !
farewell !
go !
black wind , you have done your duty .
jack .
sorry .
you were right .
those relics should be returned .
i made you something .
i hope you like it .
thank you .
i looked up the geographical data within 500 miles of xian . you once told me your dreams of waterfalls and tunnels .
i hope this will help .
how far is this waterfall from mount li ?
about 200 kilometers .
sensors indicate a huge cave behind the waterfall .
there were many rainstorms one year , and the cave never reappeared since .
thank you .
good bye .
jack , there' s a cave behind the waterfall . and a huge opening behind the cave .
that' s right .
a dozen years ago there was a drought .
the water dried up .
the cave behind the waterfall appeared , and a foolhardy villager climbed in .
then it started to rain , water quickly concealed the entrance again .
the villager was never seen again .
what do you plan to do ?
i m going into the waterfall .
how ?
get flushed in .
you crazy ?
that' s very dangerous !
you don' t even know if your dream is real !
sure !
i don' t know if it' s real or not , or who the person in the dream is to me .
but i can feel her love .
so you' re saying , unless you unravel this dream , you' il never be at peace .
what a blessed place !
wind , water , all the elements are in place .
jack , only you could have brought me here .
william , do you copy ?
loud and clear , jack .
i can see you .
i' il contact you as soon as i' m in .
but if ...
no ifs and buts .
i' il be waiting to hear from you .
i' il be in touch .
don' t worry .
whether it' s brain or brawn , he' s your superior .
jack what' s happening ?
jack ...
are you all right ?
my ass hurts .
william , i see an opening ... with man made designs .
like the sketches you drew ?
i' il see if i can get inside .
contact you later /
get ready to begin .
now !
meng yi .
meng yi ... you' ve finally returned !
i am your ok soo .
you' ve finally come !
ok soo ...
it' s really you ?
you were really waiting for me !
am i dreaming ?
i promised i' d live for you !
i' ve kept my word .
you kept yours too . you' ve really returned !
jack !
jack , thank you !
without you , this secret will stay buried for another eternity !
this place is exactly like jack' s dream !
i can' t explain it scientifically .
there are many things in this world ... ... that science can' t explain .
this cavern stays warm the year round .
it' s shunt off from the world but air flows freely .
they made massive constructions at mount li , but dug a 100 mile tunnel to build the mausoleum here .
brilliant !
a masterstroke of deception !
but where' s the entrance to the mausoleum ?
your highness !
beware !
stop !
general nangong !
he' s meng yi !
general meng !
impossible !
he can' t be general meng !
no warrior is general meng' s match !
how can he be him ?
he really is general meng !
there' s no mistake !
you really are the general ?
greetings to the general !
sir , i have followed your order to protect concubine li pending your return .
mr koo ...
great work , mr koo !
you' ve discovered the secret of levitation .
weightlessness carries grave dangers .
if we lose traction and float off , we' il be adrift forever , and turn into living fossils .
hold on !
after i left you that day , i returned with the pill .
his majesty was barely alive , but zhao gao doubted the pill' s veracity .
he ordered me to personally test it .
chancellor li said ... it was our honor to test the pill for the emperor , and forced me to take it too .
and so , those who wanted to live didn' t , and those who wished to die can never do so .
general , what happened that day after i left ?
that day , after i gave you the pill ...
black wind , you have done your duty .
fighting by your side today has been xu gui' s greatest honor in life .
i take my leave ...
halt !
attack !
attack !
surrender , general !
surrender , general !
no , never ...
i won' t believe it .
if general meng fell in battle ... then who are you ?
i am ...
everything is as i expected .
life after death ... ... troops in an eternal vigil ...
i' ve found you at last !
who' d have thought , the qin emperor would use the meteorite to create a weightless world ?
general , did you bring troops ?
no .
wait for me here .
careful .
who dares to intrude the mausoleum ?
a qin dynasty man ?
immortal ? !
jack !
are you all right ?
william ! you conned me from day one .
you' ve been working for him all along !
i ...
jack , i told you before .
greed is human nature . and desire for knowledge drives us .
i merely made use of william' s greed , and your desire for knowledge .
and now my life' s work is complete !
when you turned me in , i told myself , one day you' il make it up to me .
jack , all i want is to take some stuff back for experiments .
my discoveries will benefit the world .
i' il become the greatest scientist of the century !
no one can take anything from here .
this is a part of history .
it should stay buried forever !
without you , i couldn' t have solved this maze ... in several lifetimes !
professor !
scoundrel !
how dare you defile the mausoleum ?
the penalty is death !
nangong yan !
careful !
don' t shoot !
i want him alive !
take care of ok soo .
where' s the immortality pill ?
tell me .
halt !
general nangong !
' when the dragon pearl moves , annihilation ensues '
pull me in .
quick , give me a hand .
general nangong !
concubine li !
run !
give me your hand !
quick !
use your legs .
right , your legs .
pull me in .
a qin dynasty deputy imperial general !
tell me !
where' s the immortality pill ?
where' s the qin emperor' s sarcophagus ?
it must be in the celestial palace .
take me there !
take me there !
stay where you are !
don' t you dare try to steal anything ... or take her away !
that depends on whether you can stop me .
don' t worry .
i won' t let anyone hurt you .
jack !
help me !
jack !
jack !
ok soo , i' il take you away from here .
let' s go .
jack ...
william !
william !
help me !
hang on to me !
i only do scientific research ,
i m no tomb raider !
you must get out no matter what , and finish my research !
jack
jack , are we still friends ?
jack ...
you really aren' t meng yi ?
no , i' m not ...
whether i m meng yi or not doesn' t matter now .
what' s important is that we leave here at once !
you' re not meng yi .
i m not leaving .
i' il await meng yi' s return .
ok soo , hurry there' s no time !
no !
he' s not dead !
i' il wait for him !
