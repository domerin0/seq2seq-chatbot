tom , cut the playback !
come on out here .
# baby , it' s all right ##
you know what , ray , you' re probably right .
i mean , i' m sure you' re right .
i' ve never heard a sound like this before .
but how the hell are we gonna market this ?
we could cut the second verse , pop back into the chorus .
man , you cut that , i' il cut you in half .
all right , all right , ray .
ahem .
we could , uh , split it up .
do a side alside b type of thing .

it' s starting to show .
you' re scratching all the time .
you can' t sit still .
hey , man , have i ever missed a date ?
no , you never have .
who' s the one who delivers a record in one take , hmm ?
ray , you deliver better than anybody i know but i' m not talking to you as a businessman .
now come on , listen to me .
i' m worried about you .
as a friend , i' m telling you , man , your slip is hanging .
your slip is hanging .
you been hanging out with us country boys too much , man .
uh , don' t worry about this , man .
if this monkey gets too heavy on my back ,
i' il get an organ grinder , man , and put him to work .

you know , y' all know that sounds off .
ahem , you know what , the three part harmony is off .
let' s start it all over again , uh , from the top with the band .
# i believe it , i believe it ##
whoa , pardner !
uh , what was that ?
i knew you' d like that , ray .
it' s an eight track .
we just got it .
we can record each part separately .
whoa , nellie !
you know , i can' t wait to see that .
what' s so funny ?
nothing , " pardner .
margie' s drunk .
jeff ?
you should go home and sleep it off .
margie , come on now , let me take you home .
no !
i' il leave when i' m good and goddamn ready !
she' s good and goddamn ready right now .
why don' t you make me leave this , sucker !
teach you to treat me like some piece of meat !
i ain' t shutting up !
should we get in there ?
no .
get them all out , right now .
you' il have to make me leave !
you know what , jeff ?
get all of them out of here .
you' re a cold ass bastard !

you' re a cold ass bastard , ray !

damn right i wouldn' t .
put me down , jeff !
put me down !
damn it !
you dropped your shoe .
all right , come on , let' s get back to work .
tom , this is what i want you to do .
we' il lay my vocals down and finish the harmony parts .
uh , how' re we gonna do the harmonies , ray ?
you sent the girls home .
i know what i did with the girls .
let me take care of that .
you just turn that eight track on , and i' il do the girls ' parts myself .
and go out here somewhere and find me an " oh , johnny " girl .
uh , one minute .
what the hell' s an " oh , johnny " girl ?
i think i' ve got an idea .
# last night you were dreaming #
# and i heard you say #
# oh , johnny ! #
# when you know my name is ray #
# that' s why i believe right now #
# i believe #
# yes i believe #
# i say i believe right now #
# i believe #
# yes i believe ##
i got you a $5, 000 a night raise .
they' re gonna up you to 15 per .
rehearsal in 10 minutes .
jeff , could you get me some cigarettes ?
okay , boss .
15 per , huh ?
you know , ray , your contract with atlantic is expiring in four months .
yeah .
yeah , i' ve got the contract with me .
they' re going to double my royalties .
before we jump back in that pond ,
i thought i' d find out what else was out there .
i had a very productive chat with abc paramount yesterday .
abc ?
who told you to do that , huh ?
and you know , atlantic is family , just like the shaw agency .
ray , my job is to get you the best deal possible .
abc is very interested .
no .
how interested ?
how about a $50, 000 advance each year for three years ?
you produce your own records .
they' il deduct recording costs and give you 75 percent .
ahmet and jerry are flying in tonight , so will you put them off until i can talk things out with abc ?
well , my mama said , ain' t nothing wrong with talking .
hey , enough of the formalities .
come on , let' s go back into the office , ray .
i hope i can call you ray .
i want you to be comfortable here .
because i' il tell you something , everything is gonna be better at abc .
moving from an indie label to a major means you can sell a lot more records , as well as attract much larger crowds , both white and negro .
yeah , but mr. clark , you know , i' ve been at atlantic for so long ,
i just want to give those guys a chance , you know , to at least match the offer .
mm hmm .
oh , certainly , certainly .
but , uh , i doubt they' il be able to .
we' re giving you a state of the art deal here .
well , you know , since i' m producing my own records , i was wondering if i could uh , own my masters , too .
well ,
ray , we' ve ... we' ve never done that before .
no record company has .
well , i think i' m going to have to have it that way for me to leave atlantic records .
ahmet believes we' re family here at atlantic .
i believe we' re family here at atlantic .
obviously , you don' t !
ahmet wouldn' t believe it .
you know what he said , ray ?
he said you would never turn your back on us .
never for a schlockmeister like sam clark !
that' s rich .
sam clark' s a corporate slug , who wouldn' t know the difference between earl hines and art tatum !
we let you grow here , ray .
and nobody' s taking credit for your talent , but we nourished it .
we let you do your thing .
god damn it !
we deserve better than this .
you know what , don' t think that i don' t appreciate everything you guys have done here , jerry .
ahmet , i' m very proud of the work that we' ve done here together .
but , atlantic has done pretty good money wise on my records , haven' t they ?
yes , we' ve done very well , ray .
you ... you were the ones that taught me that making a record is business , and find the best business deal you can .
now , 75 cents of every dollar , and owning my own masters is a pretty damn good deal .
can you match it ?
ray , we would love to match it , but we just can' t .
that' s a better deal than sinatra gets .
i' m very proud of you .
looks like those boys are going to get a taste of country dumb .
yeah .
he' il be all right , man .
you guys always do find the best .

listen to that crap .
thought you said that abc wasn' t going to force nothing on him .
they didn' t .
it was ray' s idea .
something new .
what are we then , jeff ?
something old ?
yeah , what about us ?
we got to eat , too .
# other arms should reach out to me #
# other eyes smile tenderly #
# still in the peaceful dreams i see #
# the road leads back to you ##
it' s a hit record .
what the hell is wrong with that ?
critics say you' ve gone middle of the road .
the orchestra , the choir , the perry como show , man ?
if i feel the music , that means it' s real .
no , it ain' t .
ray charles is a sellout .
the blind liberace , leaving those rocking chair roots behind .
quincy jones .
can we get a picture of these two guys ?
six nine !
hey , boy .
look , here , uh , this interview is over .
i' d love to get you two together , man .

so crank out another hit .
let me tell you something , it ain' t easy to keep on being greezy , kid .
where you blow in from ?
paris .
bonjour .
yeah , man .
france is where it' s at .
yeah , man .
and all that stuff you' ve been playing , man , it' s just ... it really feels out of sight .
you know , we gotta record something together .
i mean , people will really dig it .
so , where you going after the festival ?
oh , i ...
i go to d. c. , richmond , uh , virginia , georgia .
you know what , once you get the record out there , you gotta sell it .
the south , man ?
i' m not doing that no more .
hey , come on , kid , that' s where the money is , baby .
you know , when i left seattle with hamp , we went down there , man .
and it felt like i walked into a prison cell .
you know , a black man is a " boy " in mississippi , ray .
even if he' s 80 years old .
i' m never playing to jim crow again .
ever .
if that' s what you feel , baby .
i' m serious , ray .
man , we gotta do something .
well , you know , what ... what the hell , man .
you' re just going to leave a lot more money on the table for me .
you' re welcome to it , man .
## [ electric piano playing ]

i' m an entertainer .
and ... and we all gotta play jim crow down here .
i' m sorry , man .

bea ?
what ?
you know , since i got back ...
since you got out .
yeah .
well , since i got here , you haven' t said more than two words to me .
ray , what am i supposed to say ?
my words don' t seem to mean much to you anymore .
maybe they never did .
come on , bea , you ... you know i love you .
are you gonna stop then ?
you know what , bea , what you don' t understand is there' s a lot of mean spirited people out there .
yeah .
ray ?
you know , i had to bring junior home from school today
' cause of what the other kids were sayin ' .
they got mean ass kids around here .
i think we should move to beverly hills .
no , no , ray , we' re not gonna move .
' cause it ... it' s not about where we live , ray .
it' s about what you' re doing to yourself .
and those boys worship you .
you want them to end up using that poison , too ?
bea , that' s not fair .
what' s not fair ?
what' s not fair , ray ?
that ... that' s a low blow .
hello ?
don' t jive me , milt .

ah , good , good , good .

all right .
all right , then .
oh , yeah !

ray , tell me what happened .
abc got the case dropped .
the police didn' t have a warrant .
they bought them off .
damn it , bea , do you want me to go to prison ?
no .
ray , i want you to stop lying to yourself , and they are making that completely impossible .
you know what , you don' t understand .
then make me understand , ray !
baby , when i walk out that door , i walk out alone in the dark !
i' m trying to do something that ain' t nobody ever done in music and business .
but i can' t do it if i' m alone everywhere i go .
i don' t want to be alone here , bea .
not in my own home .
look , bea , if you don' t understand me , then who will ?
i don' t know , ray .
david ?
i' m coming !
mama' s coming !
ray , we pull you out of the fire , and you want country music ?
look here , i' ve been singing country music all my life .
as a matter of fact , i used to play with the florida playboys .
we made a big investment in you and it' s paying off handsomely .
for both of us , i might add .
we don' t want to lose your fan base .
yeah , you know , you got a point there , but i actually think that we have more to gain than we do to lose .
ray , it' s a bad idea .
when i came to abc , you guys put in the contract that i can choose my own music .
you want to read that paragraph ?
it' s on page three .
i don' t need to see it .
good evening , saint louis .
it' s time for the main attraction .
the innovator of soul .
the genius himself .

thank you so much .
you know what , i know that a lot of y' all don' t know that
i ...
i was brought up in the south .
you know , every time you turn on the radio there in the south , you hear the grand ole opry .
that' s what i grew up singing , so i hope you don' t mind ,
i ...
i want to sing something to give you a taste of my country roots .

they bought that country jive hook , line and sinker .
ray , man , you' re amazing .
i' m gonna tell you something .
country music .
you know why they like it ?
the stories , man .
they got great stories .
hey , joe .
ray , i want to introduce you to joe adams .
hal ziegler hired joe as the announcer for the rest of the tour .
i know you , mayor of melody .
i used to listen to your radio show in l. a. in the ' 50s .
we' ve both come a ways since then .
what was that counting you were doing back there ?
i was cueing down the lights .
that shuts up the audience so you can sing your ballad instead of having to scream it .
hey , well , i' il be damned .
who told you to do that ?
no one .
it just needed to be done .
see , that' s what i' m talking about .
i like to hear a person say " it needed to be done " as opposed to a person saying , " it ain' t my job .
you know , tell me about central avenue .
i know you know jack lauderdale .

hello , boston !
hello , saint louis !

fathead , go on now .
you want to tell me what the hell is going on , ray ?
i' m not doing anything i haven' t been asked to .
ray' s running a business .
he shouldn' t have to waste time hearing why people were late .
i' m not talking to you , joe .
i' m talking to ray .
ray , now i know you think i' m soft on the band , but those cats would do whatever i ask .
but if you come in here with this , uh , " running a business " crap , you' re gonna lose some good people .
i' m telling you , ray .
there are musicians waiting in line to play with ray charles .
not for long , once they get a taste of you .
ray , you' re the leader , man .
be one !
come on , now .
you now what jeff , i mean things have changed .
it ain' t like the days when it was seven of us on the chitlin ' circuit .
i mean , if you weren' t busy building a bowling alley , you' d seen that .
so you know about that , huh ?
i know about everything .
i' m just trying to figure out how you did it .
you think i' m stealing from you , ray ?
if the shaw agency is gonna give you a cut of the 10 percent i' m given them .
i might as well keep the goddamn money in my pocket .
leave us alone .
we need to talk .
ray .
you can step outside , joe .
i' il be in my office .
ray , now i know that jealous bastard planted that lie in your head .
but i have never stolen from you , ray , and i never will .
i got a small business loan , and , yeah , milt shaw was giving me a little extra , but i' m not a thief , ray .
then what about that , jeff , huh ?
a promoter swearing you did side deals with him so you could split my overages !
how could you do that to me ?
we' ve been through so much , we be so like brothers .
you know what , ray ?
if we were like brothers , why are you paying joe more than you' re paying me ?
damn all that !
you broke my heart , man .
well , you know what , ray ?
you broke mine a long goddamn time ago !
well , then there it is .
you know something , ray ?
you' re going to get yours one day .
and i pray to god that he has mercy on your soul , you son of a bitch !
everything all right , ray ?
how the hell do you think it is ?

go tell him !
go , go tell him .
hey , dad .

yeah .
do you know how much making the all star team means to him ?
i know .
i got things on my mind .
we had to fire jeff .
what ?
he was stealing .
jeff ?
hmm .
i don' t believe it .
yeah , well , we' re better without him .
# my mother told me # [ audience clapping ]

that' s outrageous !
i' m going to call our lawyer .
no lawyers at international checkpoints .
now , we' re going to have to search everyone on this plane .
mr. charles , if you don' t mind we' d like to start with you .
i' d like to see your overcoat .
i don' t mind .
don' t say anything , ray .
what' s this ?
ray , this isn' t some judge in indiana .
it' s federal .
they can charge you of smuggling which can mean real prison time .
our lawyers will do what they can , but ...
hello .
you can' t hide out in here forever , ray .
look , it' s my house .
i' m not in prison yet .
no , it' s my house .
you ain' t been here more than six days since we moved in .
no , ray , no !
a needle ain' t gonna solve this !
get out of the way .
move !
only thing that can help you is god , ray .
don' t think of god ?
do you have any idea how it feels to go blind and still be afraid of the dark ?
and every day , you stand pray for just a little light , and you get nothing .
' cause god don' t listen to people like me .
stop talking like that .
as far as i' m concerned , me and god is even and i do what i please .
if goddamn it , if i want to shoot up , i shoot up .
then go ahead !
but you walk out that door and i' m doing something i should have done a long time ago .
i' m taking my boys and i' il leave .
you' re not going away .
you ... you have no place to go .
no place ?
no .
you think i' m scared of losing this ?
ray , the only thing i was ever scared of losing was you .
because where was i ever gonna find another ray robinson ?
so i put up with some terrible stuff .
maybe that makes me part to blame .
but i ain' t scared no more .
you know i love you and those boys more than anything .
that is a damn lie and you know it !
you ever look at this ?
really look at it , ray !
ray charles junior' s " most valuable player .
he was so proud this day , until you came home too loaded to go to his banquet .
no !
no !
there is something you love more than me and them boys , more than all the women you ever slept with on the road , more than all the dope you ever took .
what are you talking about ?
your music .
and if you don' t stop using that needle , they' re gonna take away your music and put you in jail .
is that poison worth losing everything ?
mr. charles ?
mr. charles .
you don' t have to go through this .
we have a substitute that can help wean you off heroin .
i have to do it on my own .
i can do it .
i can do it .
ah .
don' t touch me .
all right .
we' il do it your way .
doctor ?
mr. charles .
mr. charles , i' m coming .
he' s got no fluids left .
get an i. v. in him right away .
i' il insert the needle .
no needles .
yes .
it' s very important .
you need this .
runner , i' ve got a runner !
whoa .
let me go .
let me go .
get him on the bed .
put those restraints on him .
no needles .
no , no .
oh .
george , i miss you .
i miss you , george .
i miss you .
oh .
okay .
uh oh .
you might be in trouble right there , doc .
hot damn , you whupped my ass again !
l i' il tell you what , i won' t lose again the same way twice .
i spoke with the judge in boston , and he' il agree to probation .
he was impressed with your attorney' s arguments , and he believes you deserve one more chance .
oh , that' s great .
but you must complete our program and agree to take periodic drug tests .
you know what .
i' il do it .
i know people don' t believe
i' m done with this dope , but i' m finished .
who' s george ?
ray , you' ve come through the worst of the physical reactions .
we should begin psychotherapy sessions .
uh , look , forget the head shrinking , doc .
i can handle this .
mr. charles , you' re not the first celebrity junkie i' ve treated .
junkie ?
what ...
nobody cons me at any price .
i' m not trying to do that .
if you want me to give that judge a positive report , you will have to earn it .
doc ?
dr. hacker ?
doc ?
ray , come on , ray , play with me !
he ain' t there .
talk to me , son .
i ain' t no bad dream .
i' m a part of you .
even all that dope couldn' t keep me away .
mama , i kept my promise .
you got strong all right .
went places i never dreamed of .
but you still became a cripple .
come here , baby .
come here .
ray ?
it wasn' t your fault .
now promise us you' il never let nobody or nothing turn you into no cripple ever again .
that you' il always stand on your own two feet .
promise .
today we' re here to right a wrong that was done to one of our native sons nearly 20 years ago .
in 1961 ,
ray charles was banned from performing in the state of georgia because he refused to play before a segregated audience .
thankfully , we' ve come a long way since then .
some of us have fought for equality through the political process , but ray charles changed american culture by touching people' s hearts .
so on this day , march 7 , 1979 , we , the duly elected representatives of the state of georgia not only proclaim georgia on my mind our official state song , we also offer mr. ray charles a public apology and welcome him back home .
# every time i sing this song #
if only your mama was here .
she' s here .
she ain' t never left .
# i sing for #
# georgia #
# whoa , georgia #
# the whole day through #
# just this old , sweet song #
# keeps georgia on my mind #
# georgia #
# oh , yeah #
# yeah , georgia #
# a song of you #
# comes as sweet and clear #
# as moonlight through the pines #
# i feel that #
# other arms #
# reach out to me #
# other eyes #
# smile # # tenderly #
# well , all right now #
# yeah #
# don' t you know ? #
# still in peaceful dreams #
# i see a busy road #
# the road leads back to you #
# oh , georgia #
# no peace i find #
# please stop by #
# don' t you hear me now ? #
# just this old , sweet song #
# i say , oh , i say #
# keeps georgia on my mind #

# every time i call you on the phone #
# some fella tells me that you' re not at home #
# so unchain my heart , oh please , please set me free #
# i' m under your spell #
# i' m under your spell #
# like a man in a trance #
# like a man in a trance #
# but i know darn well #
# i know darn well # # that i don' t stand a chance #
# i don' t stand a chance #
# so , unchain my heart #

# let me go my way #
# unchain my heart #

# why lead me through a life of misery #
# when you don' t care a bag of beans for me #
# so unchain my heart , please , please set me free #
# please set me free #
# oh , won' t you set me free #
