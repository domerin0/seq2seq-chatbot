my friends , i\ x9ds always been like this since bible days .
every generation must make its own way in one place or another .

yes , but it suits me .
what political party do you folks belong to ?
the american .

not that i know of , why ?
nothing .
i was just wondering .
they say the indians will join the british , but i guess i\ x9ds just talk .
well , goodnight .
a queer one , ain' t he ?
too many questions to suit me .
and that patch over his eye .
i bet he lost it trying to see something that wasn' t his business .
goodnight .
goodnight , ma' am .
goodnight .
you didn' t get scared at what he said about the tories and the indians ?
i wasn' t even thinking about indians .
what were you thinking about ?
i was just wondering if you love me as much as i love you .
are there always flies like this ?
in real woods there are .
it must be about to rain the way these take hold .
you' il get used to them up here .
lana , we' re home now .
look !
i' il get a fire going .
i\ x9ds just a cabin , but ...
i' ve always thought i\ x9dd be nice living in a cabin .
i\ x9ds so handy to look after things when i\ x9ds small .
it seems so fine to me because i built it .
it must look small to a girl who' s been raised in a big house .
no , i\ x9ds all right , gil .
we' il like our things even better when we get there .
i' il put up the mare , we' il eat something and feel warmer ...
things will look different then .
you better take those wet things off .
you' il be sick .
gil !
gil !
gil !
gil !
tha\ x9ds only blue back .

he' il murder us , gil !
i' m sorry , lana .

you' ve got to get a hold of yourself .
this is my wife , blue back .
she' s kind of nervous and tired out .
we had a long , hard trip and then the rain and everything .

much rain .
she didn' t expect anybody to drop in at a time like this .
me go hunting bring you half deer .
hang outside .
half deer , huh ?
tha\ x9ds mighty fine of you .

we' il have a drink .

good christian .
hallelujah .
lana ...
i' m going home .
home ?
i can' t stand it .
mother was right .
i' m no frontier woman .
i had no idea it was like this .
i hate it !
what are you saying ?
you had no right to bring me here .
i\ x9ds awful !
and that horrible man , that indian , slipping in here .
now you' re acting crazy again .
blue back wouldn' t hurt you .
he' s as good a christian as you or me .
i don' t care .
i' m going home !
no , you' re not .
you' il stay right here and do as i say from now on .
you' il get over this foolishness and stop being scared , understand ?
i didn' t want to hit you .
i had to do it .
lana , look at me .
i love you , i need you .
i can' t live without you now .
you know that .
yes .
look , here' s blue back again , see ?
you got a fine woman , but you young man .
you use this on her .
lick her good !
make fine woman .
what are you thinking about now ?
gil !
what are you thinking about ?
what this place is going to look like a couple of years from now .
next summer we can start building a barn .
right on that slope , a hillside barn like i' ve always wanted .
after that , we can think about building a decent house .
i like our house just as it is now .
sure .
i always remember how you ladies hanker after frame houses .
the place will look so beautiful you won' t care what i look like .
i can get blisters on my hands and my nose peeled and tha\ x9ds the thanks i get for it .
le\ x9ds see those blisters you' re talking about .
no , now never mind .
gil , let go .
why , your hand is sore .
maybe you oughtn' t come out here .
i want to .
but haying' s hard work .
i\ x9ds the hardest job there is .
i\ x9ds no job for a woman .
now , there you go .
just because a woman is raised in a town , she has to be frail .
i' m strong .
you said you couldn' t have done it without me .
i sure married myself some good hired help .
stop it yourself .
do you like me as much as you do your old farm ?
hello , gil .
good morning , lana .
mighty pretty .
general herkimer .
hello , martin .
this is my wife , lana .
ja , ja .
hubsch .
she' s as pretty as the near side of a peach .
maybe prettier .
and lana , this is mrs. weaver and her husband .
i' m your nearest neighbour .
i' ve been meaning to call , me and george and john here .

hep , hep , hep , hep , hep , hep , hep , hep .
don' t be afraid of these women .
they' re good neighbours , once they get over being mad at you for being pretty .
don' t be so silly .
that bonnet you' ve got on is giving them a lot of worry .
and they' re dying to shoo us off so they can find out
if you' ve a family on the way .
nicholas !
we weren' t going to tell anybody .
tha\ x9ds just fine .
congratulations , martin .
tha\ x9ds just fine , a baby .
i don' t believe in young folks waiting , i always say a man needs help on his place and the only way to get it is to have children , especially boys .
why , maggie weaver , how awful .
attention .
fall in .
fall in what ?
attention !
dress to the right !
tha\ x9ds my husband .
call the roll .
amos brock .

george weaver .
here .
gilbert martin .
here .
christian reall .
christian reall .
christian ...
tha\ x9ds me .
here .
adam hartman .
here .
james mcnod .
james mcnod .
he couldn' t come today .
he had to go and buy flour .
then i' ve got to fine him .
tha\ x9ds the law .
you don' t have any right to fine a man for not coming , if he can' t .
i thought tha\ x9ds what this war was about .
people paying taxes when they didn' t have no say so about it .
tha\ x9ds right .
tha\ x9ds what i' m carrying long tom for .
ain' t up to me .
talk to the general .
we can let that go this time .
tha\ x9ds enough of the roll call , too .
you can check up later .
stand at ease , men .
neighbours , ever since new york and the 12 colonies signed the declaration of independence , this revolution has turned into a real war .
so far , we' ve been lucky here in the mohawk , but it looks like we are going to be dragged into it too , sure as shooting .
tha\ x9ds why i got you here , to get ready , no matter what happens .
i guess we all feel the same way about it .
this is our home and land and i say i\ x9ds worth fighting for .
only we got to do it by ourselves .
congress can' t help us .
they say washington needs all the troops he can get and that the frontier will have to look out for itself .
maybe them soldiers don' t like the liquor we drink up here , huh ?
adam !
maybe not , but tha\ x9ds what they say .
now about the indians .
from all i hear , the tories are making them a lot of big promises .
we got our agents working , too .
we can' t tell which way they' il go .
we' il have no trouble with them .
we' ve always treated them fair .
maybe , but just the same if you hear the bell ringing at the fort or the cannon go off , you drop everything and come running .
do you understand ?
all of you , come running .
else i' il have you flogged so fast you won' t know what .
now , come on , show the women how good you can drill .
take them around the field , captain .
attention .
nice talk , nicholas .
carry arms !
squads left , march !
i bet we can lick the whole world , the way we march .
ezra !
help us over here .
put them right on top .
come on , come on .
now she' s going good .
is the core rotten , adam ?
yeah .
let it fall right down in there .
this' il make a nice patch for wheat .
there' s good soil here .
i figure the loam' s close to four feet .
i bet there isn' t better soil in the whole valley .
you' re just a natural born farmer , ain' t you ?
so would you be , if you' d marry and settle down .
there she goes !
there she goes !
tha\ x9ds going to be good fire wood .
here goes !
start her even , cleave !
push her in , gil !
push her in there .
pull them straight .
you brought a lot of pretty things with you , mrs. martin .
heavenly .
i told mother there was no sense bringing a lot of clothes .
i' d rather spend the money on furniture .
i see you' ve got one of these feathers .
yes .
mother had five of them at home .
she said there are times when that could be more important than bread .
what is it ?
a pheasan\ x9ds feather .
it looks like an angel' s wing .
we had a lot of them .
they collected so much dust we threw them out .
yeah .
this is a nice teapot .
is it a wedgewood ?
i don' t know .
i\ x9ds just white china , i guess .
it belonged to my grandmother .
we always ate off wedgewood at home .
come out , they' ve started burning already .
great burning , started it myself .
le\ x9ds go see the burning , come on .
gil , i\ x9ds going to be beautiful .
i\ x9ds blue back .

gil , the cow .

she' il just slow us up .
i can' t stand it .
i\ x9ds like leaving part of ourselves .
don' t look back .
hurry up , gil .
hey !

mr. martin !

gil , wha\ x9ds happened ?

she was driving and all of a sudden she fainted .

i won' t .
my husbans the captain .

i don' t understand this .
never mind , she' il be all right .
wha\ x9ds the matter here ?
oh , doctor .
i\ x9ds my wife , she fainted .
i can' t say i blame her , all this racket .
gil .
gil martin .
they' re waiting for you .
the company' s ready to go .
what is it ?
there' s nothing you can do .
go on , get out of here .
how is she , gil ?
i don' t know .
everything ready ?
yes , sir .
drummer boy , play the drum .
men , follow me !
adam , did you see them ?
did you catch them ?
no .
we chased them seven , eight miles , but they got away .
what happened ?
the excitement and all the jolting was too much , but don' t fret too much , you' re both young .
you' il have another baby .
she' s all right now .
just tired .
but don' t let her talk too much .
lana .
gil .
lana , darling .
gil , our house ?
they burned it .
the crops ?
everything .
i saw it coming back .
oh , and now ...
please don' t , lana .
i failed you .
no , lana .
it wasn' t your fault .
it just happens that way sometimes .
my poor gil .
oh , lana .
you' re all right , tha\ x9ds all i care about .
it seems impossible that people can work as hard as we did for nothing .
we can build it back again .
we still have the land .
you think i' d let you come back and go through all that again ?
you were right that first night .
you shoulve gone home then .
i was a fool not to see it .
i shouldn' t have brought you here in the first place .
this is no place for you , i\ x9ds no place for any woman .
i' m not the only woman who' s gone through this .
what will we do ?
how will we live ?
adam says that mrs. mcklennar' s hired man ran off and she' s looking for a couple to work her place .
but , lana , you can' t hire out , a girl like you .
do you think ... ?
it wouldn' t have to be for long .
just until we made enough to come back here .
lana , you can' t do it .
it won' t do any harm just to talk it over with her .
no !
hired help .
no !
mrs. mcklennar !
good morning .
your name martin ?
yes , ma' am .
well , go on and stare .
i know how i look .
that hired man got drunk and ran off , he left me with everything to do .
i don' t mind a man drinking , if he knows how to hold it .
when it fixes him so he can' t do his work , he' d better go elsewhere .
don' t stand there with your mouths open .
sit down .
le\ x9ds get down to business .
you know how to farm ?
i had my own place .
yes , i heard it was burned .
tha\ x9ds too bad , but tha\ x9ds neither here nor there .
daisy !
get my dinner ready .
i could eat a horse .
i don' t do much farming here , just take care of the meadow and feed my stock , but you can do what you like .
i' m a widow .
my husband was captain barnabas mcklennar .
barney , barney .
what was i saying ?
i was brought up on army life , so when i give an order , i expect to get it obeyed .
if i take your pay , i' il do my best .
i just don' t want you coming afterwards complaining .
how much do you want ?
i never worked for anybody else .
what do you pay ?
45 pounds a year .
your house , wood and food .
if your wife can sew , i' il pay her , too .
can you sew ?
wha\ x9ds your name ?
lana .
can you sew ?
speak up !
you want to sew for me ?
yes , i' d like to .
let me see your hands .
tha\ x9ds settled .
i hate sewing myself .
hate any housework , so i do the barn and let daisy do the cooking .
i took good care of my husband .
now he' s gone , i do as i like .
i' ve got a long face , and i poke it where i please .
you may think i' m a nuisance .
yes , ma' am .
what ?
wha\ x9dd he say ?
i didn' t mean it , but i guess if you do poke , i' il think so .
your thoughts are your own property , but keep them to yourself .
come on , you' il want to see your new home .
use the back door if you want to ask me anything .
i don' t want mud tracked in my house .
i track enough myself .
i\ x9ds a mess now , after that man , but i\ x9ds a good house .
it sure is , ma' am .
nice chimney .
nice bedroom upstairs .
i used to live here , until barnabas decided to build that stone place .
i\ x9ds a beautiful house .
glad you can see it .
there' s one more thing i want to ask you .
any furniture ?
we have a bed and a few things .
i' il help you out with the rest .
you can consider the job yours , martin .
now , any questions you want to ask ?
yes , ma' am .
i just ...
well , what ?
do you belong to the right party ?
right party !
a woman hasn' t got any political opinions .
i run this farm to suit myself .
i' il shoot anybody ,
british , indian or american , who interferes in my business .
that satisfy you ?
when can you move in ?
will tomorrow be too soon ?
tomorrow ?
wha\ x9ds the matter with today ?
we' il move in today .
good !
good !
oh , lana .
oh , gil .
i\ x9ds a beautiful fireplace .
oh , almighty god , hear us , we beseech thee , and bring succour and guidance to those we' re about to bring to thy divine notice .
first , we' re thinking of mary wollaber .
she' s just 16 years old , but she' s keeping company with a soldier from fort dayton .
he' s a massachusetts man , o lord and thou knowest no good can come of that .
hallelujah .
now , we' re thinking of the sick and infirm .
peter paris has the flux real bad .
his uncle isaac , who keeps a store in dayton asks for our prayers and he says that he has got in a new supply of calicos ,
french broadcloths , fancy handkerchiefs , new hats and heavy boots all at bargain prices .
but most of all , we call upon thee , lord jehovah ,
o , god of battles , to aid thy people against the tories , for i have disturbing news for you that will sorrow this sabbath .
general washington has advised us that an enemy army of many tories and savage indians is even now on its way to our beloved valley .
every man capable of bearing arms between the ages of 16 and 60 will report tomorrow morning to general herkimer , at which time a regiment of washington' s continental army will arrive from albany , under colonel fischer , to help us .
any man failing to report for duty will be promptly hanged .
amen .
you stick close to mrs. mcklennar and do what she says .
yes , gil .
i' d better go now .
watch out for those new apple trees .
gil !
thank you , ma' am .
it used to be barney' s , but i\ x9ds no use to me now .
it might come in handy to you .
gil martin , i' m going to kiss you , so i' d better do it now , so you won' t go off with the taste of a widow .
many is the time i' ve seen barney go off just that same way .
goodbye .
he' s off .
sometimes he' d wave , but ten to one he wasn' t even seeing me .
he was thinking about all those men , you see , all those men going out to fight , to kill or be killed .
blast his eyes , loving it .
they sent you over here to tell us to come inside the fort ?
i\ x9ds orders . " women and children shall be gathered together " .
me and other men over 60 are to collect and protect them .
you old rooster !
don' t you think i can look after myself ?
yes , ma' am , but i\ x9ds orders .
i' ve been saving a corner shed for you .
shed !
do you think i' d start living in a shed at my time of life ,
like a cow ?
yes , ma' am .
no , ma' am .
go on and spit , man .
spit and get it over with .
hey !
not there , outside .
go on , get out of here .
old fool , he can' t even spit by himself .
waiting , waiting .
tha\ x9ds all we women do .
well , no news is good news .
why don' t you sit down , lana ?
mosquitoes .
mrs. mcklennar !
lana !
wake up !
come on out !
here they come !
where' s john ?
have you seen gil martin ?
gil !
take them inside .
go in .
anyone else there .

have you seen gil martin ?
i' m robert johnson , surgeon pro tem of the first regiment .
then don' t stand there yapping .

yes , ma' am .
mark , where' s gil ?
gil martin ?
gil !
gil !
gi ...
i' m captain morgan , ma' am .
there' s nobody back of me alive .
no .
general herkimer , a fine mess you' ve got yourself into this time .
i tell this fellow to go away .
look after the young ones .
shut up !
you' re not giving orders in this house .
what about it ?
i\ x9ds already mortified , ma' am .
i\ x9dil have to come off .
ja , bitte ?
ja , nicholas .
wait till i light my pipe .
john !
tell me something first , doctor .
did you ever cut off a leg before ?
why , no , sir .
i ...
well , don' t be ashamed .
a man has got to start somewhere .
i' il never forget the first deer i shot .
gil !
gil !
lana !
lana !
gil .
oh , thank god .
i\ x9ds so cold here , colder here than in the woods .
raining , lying there .
i remember thinking how hot it was , wondering ...
i' m cold .
wondering how long we' d be away , when it happened .
i heard a crack ...
daisy , some water . ... like a stick breaking and all of a sudden the fellow next to me stopped talking and fell over on his side .
then i heard a whistle , shots from everywhere .
somebody shouted we' d been ambushed .
i saw general herkimer slide off his horse and grab his knee .
peter tenyck with his head blown half off .
oh , darling , this is going to hurt .
somebody told me to lay down and then i saw them all smeared with paint , yellow and red , every colour .
oh , darling .
i' m sorry .
and back of them , tories with green coats .
i got down behind a log and aimed at a fellow .
he leaped straight up in the air .
don' t talk about it .
fell forward on his face .
after that , we just kept shooting as fast as we could load for i don' t know how long .
amos , adam hartman came over beside me .
his musket was broke ,
but he had a spear .
he kept grinning .
i remember thinking , he' s having a good time , he likes this .
soon he pointed off .
i saw an indian coming towards us , naked .
i tried to load , but it was too late .
adam stood up and braced his spear , and the indian came down .
i never saw a fellow look so funny , so surprised .
he just hung there , with his mouth open .
looking at us and not saying a word .
i had to shoot him , there wasn' t anything else to do .
i had to .
brandy , nicholas ?
ja , ja .
swallow , swallow .
now , nicholas .
go ahead .
then it started to rain and i was sick .
all the time , general herkimer sat there smoking and holding his knee .
then he said we' d all better go home .
darling , don' t talk about it .
out of 600 of us , about 240 were still alive .
but we' d won .
we licked them .
yes , darling .
we showed them they couldn' t take this valley .
yes , darling .
lana , do you hear ?
we won .
yes , darling .
you won .
now , you' ve got to sleep .
you ...
adam , help me get him down .
get that pack there .
yes .
here .
sleep , darling .
you sleep .
lana .
lana .
oh , gil .
i feel as if i' ve been asleep forever .
you needed it .
i' ve been lying here looking at you , thinking how pretty you are .
darling .
it made me think of the first days we had together at deerfield .
i' ve been thinking about that , too .
the things we' d planned .
while i was out there ,
i kept thinking about you all the time .
about how good i\ x9dil be when i\ x9ds all over and we can go home .
gil , the indians , they won' t be coming back this way again , will they ?
i don' t reckon so , after the licking we gave them .
why ?
we' re going to have another baby .
are you glad , lana ?
i feel as ...
i feel as though i' ve begun to live all over again .
are you hungry ?
doctor , how' s general herkimer ?
the general is dead .
we couldn' t stop the bleeding .
i am the resurrection and the life , saith the lord .
he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live .
and whosoever liveth and believeth ...
i know my redeemer liveth , and he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth .
and though after my skin , worms destroy this body yet in my flesh i shall see god .
come on , don' t stop .
you know what doc petry said about having plenty of hot water .
i know , but the water' s boiled away twice and nothing' s happened .
i don' t know why we need so much hot water when babies are born .
mr. martin !
mrs. mcklennar wants you at once .
gil , one of barney' s soldiers made this cradle , gave it me the night we were married .
you and lana might as well have it .
i\ x9ds mighty kind of you .
nonsense .
what good is it to me ?
can' t ever tell , a good looking widow like you .
shut up , you make me sick .
great big good for nothing , loud mouthed fool .
even if you are good looking .
get out of my way !
poor gil .
not yet boys , not yet .
i\ x9ds the waiting around that ...
not knowing wha\ x9ds going on .
why can' t dr. petry do something ?
why can' t he ?
i don' t know , gil .
blue back , you' ve had experience .
what do you think ?
having babies , tha\ x9ds woman' s business .
she better go far , far , by herself .
leave husband alone .
daisy !
hurry with those things .
this is terrible .
gil martin , get some hot water quick !
tha\ x9ds all right .
tha\ x9ds all right .
george weaver , you keep away from that spring house .
i' il get some more wood .
i\ x9ds a boy .
praise be to the lord !
