it' s not there yet ...
it doesn' t have ... the feeling .

the second half is too slow ?
yeah , that' s right .

oh , they' re great .
yes !
62 percent .
not even " amateur " .
aw , shut up !
ow !

nami , 16 .
mother , don' t die !

saint ...
john' s ... wort .
nami , 20 .
and the certified copy of your census register ?
here it is .
well , that' s it , then .
thank you .
i never knew ... about my mother and father .
well , let' s get down to business .
the last will and testament of your father ... the late kaizawa soichi .
the land , house and its contents in their entirety ... are left to you .
it' s nami .
ready to quit school and work here ?
shinichi !
don' t rush her !
oh ... thanks for these .
they help a lot .
i can' t draw this kind of stuff .
i love nami' s illustrations .
they' re so soft and gentle .
i guess it' s because she goes to art school .
kohei ?
yes ...
he' s upstairs , in the president' s office .
is it time already ?
sorry !
it' s okay .
i slept a bit .
i mean about my asking you to do this .
it' s okay .
we haven' t gone driving for a while .
good work .
we' il be back tonight .
what' s this ?
a date ?
no !
nami and i are history .
so what' s going on ?
material .
ideas we can use in the next game .
you mean the old mansion she inherited ?
you know , i' ve been thinking ...
why was i abandoned ?
you weren' t " abandoned " ...
yes , i was !
didn' t your mother die when you were born ?
your father couldn' t have raised you alone .
who' s living there now ?
no one !
the lawyer said a caretaker lives nearby .
hello ? ls shinichi there ?
no ?
well , when he gets back , tell him we' ve arrived .
yeah , okay !
so this is where you were born ...
do you remember it ?
of course not !
i left when i was two or three .
that' s why you can' t remember .
but when i was a kid i' d have this dream ...
yeah ?
there was a room with a portrait of a king , and a big staircase .
i' d be standing in front of the picture looking at it .
a big staircase ...
there might be one like it here .
i' ve been waiting for you .
i' ve been the caretaker here for 20 years ... but you are its first visitors .
miss , your late father wanted so mush to meet you .
well , here is the key .
if you need anything , please call me .
make yourself at home .
look at this place !
that' s st john' s wort .
those were my mother' s last words !
the aunt who raised you ?
what ?
remember how each flower means something in old poetry ?
well , " st. john' s wort " ... stand for " revenge " .
revenge " ?
only in very old poems .
come on .
it' s huge !
hey ...
isn' t this what you were talking about ?
the staircase in your dream ?
oh , that ...
no .
this isn' t it .
oh !
i see .
a kaizawa soichi !
and that one !
that one , too !
wow !
fantastic !
you know him ?
i never told you ?
in high school i thought he was great !
i heard he died in an accident a while back ...
was kaizawa soichi your father ?
yeah !
but i never knew he was a painter .
wow ! lsn' t that amazing !
he was better known abroad than he was in japan .
it won' t fit ?
we' il ask the caretaker about it later .
is there a studio ?
there must be .
this is kaizawa soichi' s house !
but there' s a lot about him no one' s sure of .
one story says he went abroad in his teens .
they say he was a recluse ... who only ever saw his dealer .
look !
up there !
that' s the only portrait of him .
a portrait ?
so that' s my real father ?
kaizawa soichi ...
at least now we understand one thing .
where you get your talent .
you' re his daughter , for sure .
what' s the next room ?
amazing !
kaizawa soichi !
what is it ?
hey ...
do you think that might be your mother ?
look !
see ?
wow ! lncredible !
look at them all !
wow !
look at this !
what about it ?
maybe it was yours .
these are pretty shocking .
i guess there' re hidden meanings beneath them .
what ?
what' s this ?
hey , here' s another cane ...
the last room .
okay ...
a bedroom ...
your dad' s shirts ?
it won' t work .
what' s in here ?
does it open ?
a music box ...
babies ...
nami , naomi " ...
is that me ?
maybe you had a twin !
who' s " naomi " ?
your twin , maybe .
no way !
i wonder if i' m the older or the younger ...
your name' s written first ...
so i' m older ?
guess so !
how does it feel ?
hey ...
what was that ?
what ?
didn' t you hear it ?
no .
i heard something !
like a little girl' s voice .
nope !

i can' t hear it .

you' re wrong !
i heard it .
but there' s no one here .
but ...

shinichi ... where' s that file ?
i wonder if these are paintings of those kids ...
you' re his daughter , for sure .
i' m sending his paintings .
toko .
what' il i tell nami ?
i' il erase all this .
not so fast .
it' il be evidence .
what ?
didn' t you see something ?
where ?
the hall upstairs .
i don' t see a thing .
i thought i saw something moving .
i' m done .
hello ?
it' s toko .
i did a newspaper search .
there' ve been seven kids disappear there , over the last dozen years .
seven ?
you' re sure it' s not six ?
no , seven .
it fits if you include the one in the studio .
but that was ...
maybe that isn' t naomi .
the papers say it was all boys that disappeared .
i checked it with the police lists , too .
there' s yellow flowers in this picture , too .
and this one .
yellow flowers ...
that one , too !
is that st. john' s wort ?
the papers say it was all boys that disappeared .
she' s growing !
i didn' t want you to see .
i don' t know what to say .
your ...
naomi !
naomi !
wait !
but when i was a kid i' d have these dreams ...
there was a room with a portrait of a king ... and a big staircase .
i' d be standing in front of the picture looking at it .
are you naomi ?
my younger sister ?
i drew those !
why ?
naomi ...
nami ...
i' m ... your twin ... brother .
when they took you away ...
i waited and waited for you to come back .
don' t leave me alone !
but ... you forgot me .
you were happy growing up not knowing anything about me !
why should i be the only one to suffer , i wondered .
i hated you .
i wanted to make you as scared as i' d always been .
and i did .
but the fear that you' ve felt ... is only a millionth of what i have !
i was terrified of father .
all my life !
but when he died , i realized ... only he could have painted what he did .
his love was in them .
i was happy i' d been the model for his painting .
all of those pictures ... are of me ... proof that i existed .
nami ... will you do me a favor ?
i know you will .
i want you to finish this picture , in father' s place .
me ?
that picture ?
yes !
paint me ... with eyes of flame .
we' re the only ones who can understand him .
you can do it .
it' s his blood that flows in you .
father always treasured ... these pictures .
you were here ... together with us ... always .
nami ... you' il do it , won' t you .
nami ... hurry !
nami !
father !
father !
well ?
it' s kind of mean to nami ...
it' s fine as an ending .
i think it' s a bit harsh .
well , let' s see mine .
kohei !
what happened ? !
it' s naomi !
she' s alive !
naomi ?
is there another room ?
i' m looking !
there' s no time !
kohei !
kohei !
nami !
yeah ?
kohei , are you okay ?
i' ve found them !
where ?
go upstairs ...
where ?
hall ...
shinichi !
nami !
nami !
answer me !
nami !
nami !
let go of me !
let go !
naomi ... !
naomi !
