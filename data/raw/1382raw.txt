i can break through walls , i just can' t ...
that' s fine .
i can' t get this on .
mr. incredible ...
do you have a secret identity ?
every superhero has a secret identity .
i don' t know a single one who doesn' t .
who wants the pressure of being super all the time ?
of course i have a secret identity .
can you see me in this at the supermarket ?
come on .
who' d want to go shopping as elastigirl , know what i mean ?
superladies , they' re always trying to tell you their secret identity .
think it' il strengthen the relationship or something .
i said , " girl , i don' t want to know about your mild mannered alter ego .
i mean , you tell me you' re a super mega ultra lightning babe , that' s all right with me .
i' m good .
i' m good .
no matter how many times you save the world , it always manages to get back in jeopardy again .
sometimes i just want it to stay saved , you know ?
for a little bit .
i feel like the maid .
i just cleaned up this mess .
can we keep it clean for ten minutes ?
i could get to that point .
" please ?
we' re not finished .
sometimes i think i' d just like the simple life , you know ?
relax a little and raise a family .
settle down ?
are you kidding ?
i' m at the top of my game !
i' m up there with the big dogs !
girls , come on .
leave the saving of the world to the men ?
i don' t think so .
i don' t think so .
we interrupt for a bulletin .
a high speed pursuit between police and armed gunmen is underway , traveling northbound on san pablo ave .
yeah , i' ve got time .
mr. incredible .

my cat , squeaker , won' t come down .

i suggest you stand clear .
there could be trouble .

my name is incrediboy .
i' ve been nice , i' ve stood for photos , signed every scrap of paper you pushed at me ...
no , don' t worry about training me .
i know your moves , crime fighting style , favorite catch phrases , everything !
i' m your number one fan !
hey !
hey , wait !
you know ... ... you can tell a lot about a woman by the contents of her purse , but maybe that' s not what you had in mind .
hey , look ...
elastigirl .
mr. incredible .
it' s all right .
i' ve got him .
sure , you' ve got him .
i just took him out for you .
sure , you did .
his attention was on me .
a fact i exploited to do my job .
my job , you mean .
a simple thank you will suffice .
thanks , but i don' t need any help .
whatever happened to " ladies first " ?
well , whatever happened to equal treatment ?
look , the lady got me first .
well , we could share , you know .
i work alone .
well , i think you need to be more ... ... flexible .
are you doing anything later ?
i have a previous engagement .
now , you just stay here .
they usually pick up the garbage in an hour .
hey , incredible !
hey , frozone !
shouldn' t you be getting ready ?
i still got time .
he' s gonna jump !
i think you broke something .
with counseling , i think you' il come to forgive me .
wait a minute .
bomb voyage .
and incrediboy !
incrediboy ?
aren' t you curious about how i get around so fast ?
i have rocket boots .
go home , buddy .
now .
what ?
can we talk ?
you always say be true to yourself , but you never say which part to be true to .
well , i' ve finally figured out who i am .
i am your ward ...
incrediboy !
and now , you have officially carried it too far , buddy .
this is because i don' t have powers , isn' t it ?
not every superhero has powers , you know .
you can be super without them .
i invented these .
i can fly .
can you fly ?
fly home , buddy .
i work alone .
just give me one chance !
i' il show you .
i' il go get the police .
buddy , don' t !
it' il only take a second , really .
no , stop !
there' s a bomb !

i can do this if you let go !
will you just ... ?
i' m trying to help !
stop !
let go of my cape !
take this one home .
and make sure his mom knows what he' s been doing .
i can help you .
you' re making a mist ...
the injured jumper .
you sent paramedics ?
they picked him up .
the blast in that building was caused by bomb voyage who i caught robbing the vault .
we might nab him if we set up a perimeter .
he got away ?
well , yeah .
skippy here made sure of that .
incrediboy .
you' re not affiliated with me !
holy smokes , i' m late .
listen , i' ve gotta be somewhere .
what about bomb voyage ?
any other night , i' d go after him , but i really gotta go .
don' t worry .
we' il get him !
eventually !
is the night still young ?
you' re very late .
how do i look ?
good ?
the mask .
you still got the mask .
showtime .
robert parr , will you have this woman to be your lawful wedded wife ?
you' re late .
when you asked if i was doing anything later ,
i didn' t realize you' d forgotten .
i thought it was playful banter .
it was .
cutting it close , don' t you think ?
you need to be more ... flexible .
i love you , but if we' re gonna make this work , you' ve gotta be more than mr. incredible .
you know that .
don' t you ? ... so long as you both shall live ?
i do .
i pronounce this couple husband and wife .
as long as we both shall live .
no matter what happens .
hey , come on .
we' re superheroes .
what could happen ?
in a stunning turn of events , a superhero is being sued for saving someone who , apparently , didn' t want to be saved .
the plaintiff , oliver sansweet , who was foiled in his attempted suicide by mr. incredible , has filed suit against the famed superhero in superior court .
mr. sansweet didn' t ask to be saved .
he didn' t want to be saved .
the injury received from mr. incredible' s " actions " ,
causes him daily pain .
i saved your life !
you didn' t save my life !
you ruined my death .
my client has no comment .
another suit was filed by victims of the el train accident .
incredible' s court losses cost the government millions .
and opened the flood gates for dozens of superhero lawsuits the world over .
it is time for their secret identity to become their only identity .
time for them to join us , or go away .
under public pressure , and the financial burden of an ever mounting series of lawsuits , the government quietly initiated the superhero relocation program .
the supers were granted amnesty from responsibility for past actions , in exchange for the promise to never again resume hero work .
where are they now ?
they are living among us .
average citizens , average heroes .
quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place .
denied ?
you' re denying my claim ?
i don' t understand .
i have full coverage .
i' m sorry , mrs. hogenson , but our liability is spelled out in paragraph 17 .
it states clearly ...
i can' t pay for this .
excuse me .
claims , bob parr .
i' m calling to celebrate a momentous occasion .
we' re now officially moved in .
yeah , well , that' s great , honey .
the last three years don' t count because ...
because i finally unpacked the last box .
now , it' s official .
ha , ha , ha .
why do we have so much junk ?
listen , i' ve got a client .
say no more .
go save the world one policy at a time , honey .
oh !
i gotta go pick up the kids .
see you tonight .
bye , honey .
excuse me .
where were we ?
i' m on a fixed income , and if you can' t help me ,
i don' t know what i' il do .
all right , listen closely .
i' d like to help you , but i can' t .
i' d like to tell you to take a copy of your policy to norma wilcox on ... [ whispering ]
norma wilcox .
w i l c o x. on the third floor .
but i can' t .
i also do not advise you to fill out and file a ws2475 form with our legal department on the second floor .
i wouldn' t expect someone to get back to you quickly to resolve the matter .
i' d like to help , but there' s nothing i can do .
oh , thank you , young man .
sorry .
i know you' re upset !
pretend to be upset .
parr !
you authorized payment on the walker policy !
someone broke into their house , mr. huph .
their policy covers ...
i don' t wanna know about it .
don' t tell me about it .
tell me how you' re keeping lnsuricare in the black .
tell me how that' s possible , with you writing checks to every harry hardluck and sally sobstory that gives you a phone call .
morning break is over .
morning break is over .
i appreciate you coming down here , mrs. parr .
what' s this about ?
has dash done something wrong ?
he' s a disruptive influence and he openly mocks me in front of the class .
he says .
look , i know it' s you !
he puts thumbtacks on my stool .
you saw him do this ?
well ... not really .
no .
actually , not .
oh , then how do you know it was him ?
i hid a camera .
yeah , and this time , i' ve got him .
see ?
you see ?
you don' t see it ?
he moves !
right there !
wait , wait !
right there !
right as i' m sitting down !
i don' t know how he does it , but there' s no tack before he moves and after he moves , there' s a tack .
coincidence ?
i think not !
bernie ...
don' t " bernie " me .
this little rat is guilty !
you and your son can go now , mrs. parr .
i' m sorry for the trouble .
you' re letting him go again ?
he' s guilty !
you can see it on his smug little face .
guilty , i say , guilty !
dash , this is the third time this year you' ve been sent to the office .
we need to find a better outlet .
a more ... constructive outlet .
maybe i could , if you' d let me go out for sports .
honey , you know why we can' t do that .
i promise i' il slow up .
i' il only be the best by a tiny bit .
dashiell robert parr , you are an incredibly competitive boy .
and a bit of a showoff .
the last thing you need is temptation .
you always say , " do your best .
but you don' t really mean it .
why can' t i do the best that i can do ?
right now , honey , the world just wants us to fit in , and to fit in , we just gotta be like everybody else .
dad always said our powers were nothing to be ashamed of .
our powers made us special .
everyone' s special , dash .
which is another way of saying no one is .
rydinger , where you headed ?
hi , tony .
hey .
hey , tony , can i carry your books ?
that' s kind of funny .
hey , tony , do you play football ?
tony , i thought we were gonna go swimming .
he looked at me .
come on , violet !
darn kids .
sitting on the driveway ...
oh , great .
mom .
you' re making weird faces again .
no , i' m not .
you make weird faces , honey .
do you have to read at the table ?
uh huh .
yeah .
smaller bites , dash .
yikes !
bob , could you help the carnivore cut his meat .
dash , you have something you wanna tell your father about school ?
well , we dissected a frog .
dash got sent to the office again .
good .
good .
no , bob , that' s bad .
what ?
dash got sent to the office again .
what ? !
what for ?
nothing .
he put a tack on the teacher' s chair ... during class .
nobody saw me .
you could barely see it on the tape .
they caught you on tape and you still got away with it ?
whoa !
you must have been booking .
how fast were you going ?
we are not encouraging this .
i' m not , i' m just asking how fast ...
honey !
great .
first the car , now i gotta pay to fix the table ...
what happened to the car ?
here .
i' m getting a new plate .
so , how about you , vi ?
how was school ?

you' ve hardly touched your food .
i' m not hungry for meatloaf .
well , it is leftover night .
we have steak , pasta ...
what are you hungry for ?
tony rydinger .

well , you are .
i said , shut up , you little insect .

i' il be back later .
where are you two going ?
it' s wednesday .
bowling night .
say hello to honey for me , lucius .
will do .
good night , helen .
good night , kids .
don' t think you' ve avoided talking about the principal' s office .
your father and i are still gonna discuss it .
i' m not the only kid who' s been sent to the office .
other kids don' t have superpowers .
now , it' s perfectly normal ...
what do you know about normal ?
what does anyone in this family know about normal ?
now , wait a minute , young lady .
we act normal .
i wanna be normal .
the only normal one is jack jack , and he' s not even toilet trained .
lucky .
i meant about being normal .
so now i' m in deep trouble .
i mean , one more jolt of this death ray and i' m an epitaph .
somehow i managed to find cover .
what does baron von ruthless do ?
he starts monologuing .
he starts monologuing .
he starts this prepared speech about how feeble i am compared to him .
how inevitable my defeat is , the world will soon be his .
yada , yada , yada .
yammering .
yammering .
i mean , the guy has me on a platter , and he won' t shut up .
municiberg , we have a 23 56 ...
23 56 , what is that ?
robbery ?
this is just sad .
want to catch a robber ?
no .
tell you the truth , i' d rather go bowling .
look , what if we actually did what our wives think we' re doing ?
just to shake things up .
he' s not alone .
the fat guy' s still with him .
they' re just talking .
what are we doing here ?
protecting people .
nobody asked us .
you need an invitation ?
i' d like one , yes .
we keep sneaking out to do this , and ...
you remember gazerbeam ?
there was something in the paper .
he had trouble with civilian life .
when did you see him ?
i don' t see anyone from the old days .
just you .
and we' re pushing our luck as it is .
come on .
it was fun the first time , but if we keep doing this ...
we have a report on a fire ...
a fire .
we' re close !
yeah , baby !
we' re gonna get caught .
fire !
yeah !
is that everybody ?
yeah .
it better be .
can' t you put this out ?
i can' t lay down a layer thick enough !
it' s evaporating too fast !
what' s that mean ?
it means it' s hot .
i' m dehydrated , bob .
you' re out of ice ?
you can' t run out .
you can use water in the air .
there is no water in this air !
what' s your excuse , run out of muscle ?
i can' t smash walls .
the building' s getting weaker .
it' s gonna come down on top of us .
i wanted to go bowling !
all right !
stay right on my tail !
this is gonna get hot !
yeah .
uh oh .
oh , good .
that ain' t right .
we look like incompetent bad guys !
you can get water out of the air .
freeze !
freeze !
i' m thirsty .
i said freeze !
i' m just getting a drink .
you' ve had your drink .
now ...
i know .
i know .
freeze .
police officers !
that was way too close .
we are not doing that again .
verify you want to switch targets ?
over .
trust me .
this is the one he' s been looking for .
i thought you' d be back by 11 .
i said i' d be back later .
i assumed you' d be back later .
if you came back at all ...
... you' d be " back later " .
well , i' m back , okay ?
is this rubble ?
it was just a little workout .
just to stay loose .
you know how i feel about that .
darn you !
we can' t blow cover again .
the building was coming down anyway .
what ?
you knocked down a building ?
it was on fire .
structurally unsound .
it was coming down .
have you been listening to the police scanner again ?
i performed a public service .
you act like that' s a bad thing .
it is a bad thing , bob !
uprooting our family again , so you can relive the glory days is a bad thing .
it' s better than acting like they didn' t happen !
yes !
they happened !
but this , our family , is what' s happening now , bob .
and you are missing this !
i can' t believe you don' t want to go to your own son' s graduation .
it' s not a graduation .
he' s moving from fourth to fifth grade .
it' s a ceremony !
it' s psychotic !
they keep creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity but if someone is exceptional ...
this is not about you , bob .
it' s about dash .
you want to do something for dash ?
let him actually compete .
let him go out for sports !
i will not be made the enemy !
you know why we can' t do that .
because he' d be great .
this is not about you !
all right , dash .
i know you' re listening .
come on out .
vi ?
you , too , young lady .
come on .
come on out .
it' s okay , kids .
we' re just having a discussion .
pretty loud discussion .
but that' s okay .
what' s important is that mommy and i are a team .
we' re united , uh , against forces of ...
pigheadedness ?
i was gonna say evil .
we' re sorry we woke you .
everything' s okay .
go back to bed .
it' s late .
good night , mom .
night , dad .
good night .
in fact , we should all be in bed .
request claim on claim numbers 158183 ... [ on phone ]
request claim on claim numbers 158183 ...
haven' t you got him yet ?
where is he ?
mr. huph would like to talk to you in his office .
now ?
now .
sit down , bob .
i' m not happy , bob .
not happy .
ask me why .
okay .
why ?
why what ?
be specific , bob .
why are you unhappy ?
your customers make me unhappy .
what , you' ve gotten complaints ?
complaints i can handle .
what i can' t handle is your customers ' inexplicable knowledge of lnsuricare' s inner workings !
they' re experts .
experts , bob !
exploiting every loophole , dodging every obstacle !
they' re penetrating the bureaucracy !
did i do something illegal ?
no .
we shouldn' t help our customers ?
the law requires that i answer no .
we' re supposed to help people .
help our people !
starting with our stockholders .
who' s helping them out , huh ?
you know , bob , a company ...
is like an enormous clock . ... is like an enormous ...
yes .
precisely .
it only works if all the little cogs mesh together .
now , a clock needs to be cleaned , well lubricated and wound tight .
the best clocks have jewel movements , cogs that fit , that cooperate by design .
i' m being metaphorical , bob .
know what i mean by cooperative cogs ?
bob ?
bob ?
look at me when i' m talking to you , parr .
that man out there , he needs help .
don' t change the subject .
we' re discussing your attitude .
he is getting mugged !
well , let' s hope we don' t cover him .
i' il be right back .
stop right now or you' re fired !
close the door .
get over here , now .
i' m not happy , bob .
not happy .
he got away .
good thing , too .
you were this close to losing your ...
uh oh .
please report to operating room 722 immediately .
how is he ?
he' il live .
i' m fired , aren' t i ?
you think ?
what can i say , rick ?
nothing you haven' t said before .
someone was in trouble .
always .
i had to do something .
every time you say that , it' s a month and a half of trouble for me .
hundreds of thousands of taxpayer' s dollars .
i know .
we pay to keep the company quiet .
we pay damages , erase memories , relocate your family .
every time it gets harder .
money , money , money .
we can' t keep doing this .
we appreciate what you did in the old days , but those days are over .
from now on , you' re on your own .
listen , bob .
maybe i could relocate you , you know , for old times ' sake .
i can' t do that to my family .
everyone just got settled .
i' il make it work .
thanks .
take care of yourself .
what are you waiting for ?
i don' t know .
something amazing , i guess .
me , too , kid .
huh ?
hold still " ?
mr. incredible .
room is secure .
commence message .
hello , mr. incredible .
yes , we know who you are .
rest assured , your secret is safe with us .
my name is mirage .
we have something in common .
according to the government , neither of us exist .
please pay attention , as this message is classified and will not be repeated .
i represent a top secret division of the government , designing and testing experimental technology , and we have need of your unique abilities .
something happened at our testing facility .
honey !
huh ?
what ?
dinner' s ready .
okay . ... it is contained within an isolated area , it threatens to cause incalculable damage to itself and our facilities , jeopardizing hundreds of millions of dollars ...
is someone in there ?
it' s the tv , trying to watch .
because of its sensitive nature ...
stop .
it' s time for dinner .
one minute !
if you accept , your payment will be triple your current annual salary .
call the number on the card .
voice matching will ensure security .
the supers aren' t gone , mr. incredible .
you' re still here .
you can still do great things .
or ... ... you can listen to police scanners .
your choice .
you have 24 hours to respond .
think about it .
this message will self destruct .
uh oh .
you are one distracted guy .
am i ?
i don' t mean to be .
i know you miss being a hero and your job is frustrating .
i just want you to know how much it means to me that you stay at it anyway .
honey ?
about the job ?
what ?
something' s happened .
what ?
the , uh ...
what ?
the company is sending me to , uh , a conference .
a conference ?
out of town .
i' m gonna be gone for a few days .
they' ve never sent you to a conference before .
this is good , isn' t it ?
yes .
you see ?
they' re finally recognizing your talents .
you' re moving up .
yes .
honey !
this is wonderful !
yes , it is .
hello ?
this is mr. incredible .
i' m in .
the omnidroid 9000 is a top secret prototype battle robot .
lts artificial intelligence enables it to solve any problem it' s confronted with .
and , unfortunately ...
let me guess .
it got smart enough to wonder why it had to take orders .
we lost control .
now it' s loose in the jungle , threatening our facility .
we' ve had to evacuate all personnel from the island for their own safety .
how am i going in ?
the omnidroid' s defenses necessitate an air drop from 5000 feet .
lts cloaking devices make it difficult to track .
we' re pretty sure it' s on the southern half of the island .
one more thing .
obviously it represents a significant investment .
you want me to shut it down without destroying it .
you are mr. incredible .
i' ve got to warn you , it' s a learning robot .
every moment you fight it increases its knowledge of how to beat you .
shut it down .
do it quickly .
don' t destroy it .
and don' t die .
great .
thanks .
showtime .
huh ?
hmm .
uh oh .
oh , my back !
oh !
surprising .
we must bring him back .
sound the all clear , and invite him to dinner .
most important , keep things light .
praise him .
make him feel like we appreciate his abilities .
am i overdressed ?
actually , you look rather dashing .
i take it our host is ...
i' m sorry .
he won' t be dining with us .
he hopes you' il understand .
of course .
i do usually make it a point to know who i' m working for .
he prefers a certain amount of anonymity .
surely , you of all people understand that .
i was just wondering , of all the places to settle down , why live ...
with a volcano ?
he' s attracted to power .
so am i.
it' s a weakness we share .
seems a bit unstable .
i prefer to think of it as misunderstood .
aren' t we all ?
volcanic soil is among the most fertile on earth .
everything at the table was grown right here .
how does it compare ?
everything' s delicious .
jeez .
hurry , honey .
or you' il be late for work .
have a great day , honey .
thanks .
help customers , climb ladders ...
bring bacon .
all that jazz .
you have an appointment ?
i' m an old friend .
i just wanted to ...
all visitors are required ...
go check the electric fence .
what is it ?
who are you ?
what do you want ?
my god , you' ve gotten fat .
come in .
come , come .
yes , things are going quite well .
quite well .
my god , no complaints .
but , you know , it is not the same .
not the same at all .
weren' t you in the news ?
some show in prayge ...
prague ?
milan , darling .
milan .
supermodels .
nothing super about them .
spoiled , stupid , little stick figures with poofy lips who think only about themselves .
feh !
i used to design for gods .
but perhaps you come with a challenge , eh ?
i was surprised to get your call .
e , i just need a patch job .
hmm .
this is megamesh .
outmoded , but very sturdy .
and you' ve torn right through it !
what have you been doing , robert ?
moonlighting hero work ?
must have happened a long time ago .
i see .
this is a hobo suit , darling .
you can' t be seen in this .
i won' t allow it !
fifteen years ago , maybe , but now ?
what do you mean ?
you designed it .
i never look back , darling .
it distracts from the now .
you need a new suit .
that much is certain .
a new suit ?
where the heck am i gonna get a new suit ?
you can' t !
it' s impossible !
i' m far too busy .
so ask me now , before i again become sane .
wait .
you want to make me a suit ?
you push too hard , darling !
but i accept .
it will be bold .
dramatic !
yeah .
heroic !
yeah , something classic , like dynaguy !
oh !
he had a great look !
oh , the cape and the boots ...
no capes !
isn' t that my decision ?
do you remember thunderhead ?
tall , storm powers .
nice man .
good with kids .
listen , e ...
november 15th of ' 58 .
all was well , another day saved when his cape snagged on a missile fin .
thunderhead was not the brightest bulb ...

helen parr ?
you know ...
elastigirl ?
darling !
it' s been such a long time after all these years !
so long !
it' s been a while .
there' s only one person bob would trust to patch his supersuit .
that' s you .
yes , yes , yes .
marvelous , isn' t it ?
much better than those horrible pajamas he used to wear .
they are finished .
when are you coming to see ?
i' m calling about ...
don' t make me beg .
i won' t do it , you know .
beg , no , i' m calling about suit .
bob' s suit !
i' m calling about bob' s suit .
you come in one hour , darling .
i insist , okay ?
okay .
goodbye .
hmm .
it' s bigger !
it' s badder !
ladies and gentlemen , it' s too much for mr. incredible !
it' s finally ready .
you know , i went through quite a few supers to get it worthy to fight you , but man , it wasn' t good enough !
after you trashed the last one , i had to make some major modifications .
sure it was difficult , but you are worth it .
i mean , after all , i am your biggest fan .
buddy ?
my name is not buddy !
and it' s not incrediboy either !
that ship has sailed .
all i wanted was to help you .
i only wanted to help !
and what did you say to me ?
fly home , buddy .
i work alone .
it tore me apart .
but i learned an important lesson .
you can' t count on anyone .
especially your heroes .
i was wrong to treat you that way .
i' m sorry .
see ?
now you respect me , because i' m a threat .
that' s the way it works .
there' s a lot of people , whole countries who want respect .
and they will pay through the nose to get it .
how do you think i got rich ?
i invented weapons .
now i have a weapon only i can defeat .
and when i unleash it , i' il get ...
you sly dog !
you got me monologuing .
i can' t believe it .
it' s cool , huh ?
zero point energy .
i save the best inventions for myself .
am i good enough now ?
who' s super now ?
i' m syndrome !
your nemesis and ...
oh , brilliant !
all right , try this one on for size , big boy .
gazerbeam .
kronos ?
life reading negative .
mr. incredible terminated .
this project has completely confiscated my life , darling .
consumed me as only hero work can .
my best work , i must admit .
simple , elegant , yet bold .
you will die .
e , i just ...
i did robert' s suit , and it turned out so beautiful , i had to continue .
it' s great to see you , but i have no idea what you' re talking about .
i just ...
yes , words are useless .
gobble , gobble , gobble .
too much of it , darling .
too much !
that is why i show you my work .
that is why you are here .
edna mode .
and guest .
come .
sit .
cream and sugar ?
thanks .
i started with the baby .
started ?
shh !
darling !
i cut it a little roomy for the free movement .
the fabric is comfortable for sensitive skin ,
completely bulletproof .
and machine washable , darling .
that' s a new feature .
what on earth do you think the baby will be doing ?
well , i' m sure i don' t know , darling .
luck favors the prepared .
i didn' t know the baby' s powers , so i covered the basics .
jack jack doesn' t have any powers .
no ?
well , he' il look fabulous anyway .
your boy' s suit i designed to withstand enormous friction without heating up or wearing out .
a useful feature .
your daughter' s suit was tricky .
i finally created a sturdy material that will disappear completely as she does .
your suit can stretch as far as you can , without injuring yourself , and still retain its shape .
virtually indestructible ... ... yet it breathes like egyptian cotton .
as an extra feature , each suit contains a homing device , giving you the precise global location of the wearer at the touch of a button .
well , darling ?
what do you think ?
what do i think ?
bob is retired !
i' m retired !
our family is underground .
you helped my husband resume secret hero work behind my back ?
well , i assumed you knew , darling .
why would he keep secrets from you ?
he wouldn' t .
didn' t .
doesn' t .
men at robert' s age are often unstable .
prone to weakness .
what are you saying ?
do you know where he is ?
of course .
do you know where he is ?
hey , hey .
we got a man down !
come on , let' s go .
are you okay ?
what happened ?
break surveillance and engage .
continuing sweep ...
insuricare .
oh , hello .
this is helen parr .
bob parr is my husband .
i was wondering if you could give me the number of the hotel he' s staying at ?
the number i have is no good .
mr. parr no longer works here .
what do you mean ?
he' s on a business trip .
a company retreat .
my records say he was terminated almost two months ago .
so , you don' t know where he is .
would you like to find out ?
i am such an idiot .
i let this happen , you know .
the new sports car , the getting in shape , the blond hair , the lies .
yes , he attempts to relive the past .
now i' m losing him !
what' il i do ?
what' il i do ?
what are you talking about ?
you are elastigirl !
my god !
pull yourself together .
what will you do ?
is this a question ?
show him you remember that he is mr. incredible , and you will remind him who you are !
well , you know where he is .
go !
confront the problem !
fight !
win !
and call me when you get back , darling .
i enjoy our visits .
there' s lots of leftovers that you can reheat .
make sure dash does his homework .
and both of you , get to bed on time .
i should be back tonight .
late .
you can be in charge that long , can' t you ?
yeah .
but why am i in charge again ?
nothing .
just a little trouble with daddy .
you mean dad' s in trouble , or dad is the trouble ?
i mean either he' s in trouble , or he' s going to be .
what' s that ?

hey , are those for us ?
