it' s a wonder ... ...
wonder woman ...
you' re so wild and wonderful
' cause it seems whenever ... ... we' re together ... ... the planets all stand still .
barbarella' s psychedelia ... ... there' s a kind of cockle shell about you .
barbarella ...
bar ... barbarella .
you dazzle me with rainbow colors ...
fade away the duller shade of living ...
get me up high ...
teach me to fly ...
electrify ...
a night with starry light ... ... above the stratosphere .
bring your dearness near
till the dawn comes tumbling down
don' t make a sound .
every word we need comes from the sky .
can' t you read my mind
sayin ' love
don' t you give me a cold shoulder
still i' m dying , girl , to hold you
and make love ....
... love ...
barbarella' s psychedelia ... ... never can a fella name or clone you ...
barbarella bar ... barbarella
stand by for a message from dianthus ... ... president of earth and rotating premier of the sun system .
barbarella ?
mr. president .
love !
love !
just a minute .
i' il slip something on .
don' t trouble yourself ..
this is an affair of state .
what i must say not only is grave ...
it' s a secret .
a secret ?
have you ever heard of a young scientist named duran duran ?
yes .
recently en route to the north star ... ... he vanished into the uncharted regions of tau ceti .
but ... why is that a secret ?
because duran duran is the inventor of the positronic ray .
it' s a weapon .
weapon ?
why would anyone want to invent a weapon ?
how should i know ?
the universe has been pacified for centuries , sir .
as far as we know .
yet we know nothing of tau ceti or its inhabitants .
could they still be in a primitive state of neurotic irresponsibility ? .
precisely .
and if they learn from this young scientist ... ... the secret of the positronic ray ... ... they will be able to shatter the loving union of the universe .
that might mean archaic insecurity ...
and war .
you mean selfish competition and ...
i mean war .
bloody conflict among entire tribes .
i don' t believe it .
neither do i.
but we can' t take a chance .
something must be done .
yes .
you' re the girl who must do it .
why me ?
i have no armies or police .
i can' t spare the presidential band .
plus , you' re a 5 star astro navigatrix .
find duran duran ... ... and use your incomparable talents to preserve the security of the stars ... ... and our own motherplanet .
how do you read me ?
straight .
here' s the one known photo of duran .
age 26 .
hazel eyes .
a rather handsome fellow .
i don' t think i' il be able to recognize him , sir .
now , this is a portable brainwave detector .
attention ...
set your atom transmitter at 0 3 5 .
positive .
object in transit .
object received .
in order to test for duran duran' s presence , simply press this contact .
light will glow .
the alarm will sound .
it has a built in tongue box .
here is something you may need .
it' s a weapon ?
for self preservation .
we borrowed it from the museum of conflict .
that' s my good girl .
one day , barbarella ... ... we must meet in the flesh .
thankyou .
and ...
iove !
love !
armed ...
like a naked savage .

what' s happening ?
magnetic disturbances .
magnetic disturbances ?
emergency systems !
all emergency systems will now operate .
our magnetic screens are dead !
force of magnetic hurricane is 11 . 9 .
gyro compass is not , repeat , not functioning .
you mean you can' t navigate ?
that is correct .
i' il switch it to manual .
what are our chances ?
our present possibilities of non destruction ... ... are 0 . 00002 to 10, 000 .
my number 2 stabilizer has been damaged .
where am i ?
that' s what i was going to ask you .
planet 16 in the system tau ceti .
air density 0 . 051 .
cool weather with the possibility of stormy precipitations .
analysis of the atmosphere : terrestial with a mild excess of oxygen .
i count 600324 molecules per cubic millimeter .
well , at least i' il be able to breathe .
what marvelous little girls !
hi !
do you speak english ?
parlez vous franais ?
wait , let me adjust my tongue box .
must be a galactic 5 dialect .
but i haven' t skied in ages !
but that' s duran duran' s spaceship !
hi !
listen , children , this game is amusing , but it' s gone too far .
i don' t want to hurt you .
i want to know some things about this spaceship .
come on , untie me or i' il call your parents .
that' s very sweet , but i ...
no !
help !
help !
stop !
hello !
thank you !
no !
i can' t understand .
parlez vous franais ?
better adjust my tongue box .
are you all right ?
i think so ...
who are you ?
i am mark hand , the catchman .
and who are you ?
i' m from the planet earth .
tell me what you know of this spaceship .
i know nothing .
it was here when i accepted the job of the catchman .
catchman ?
yes .
children live on icy weir ... ... until they have reached a serviceable age .
serviceable ?
then i capture them just as you saw .
i turn them over to the authorities .
i see .
thank you .
ever heard the name duran duran ?
i know nothing .
i live alone on icey weir .
such is a catchman' s life .
only in sogo will you find the answer to your question .
sogo ?
is it near ? .
it' s just beyond that ice deck .
did i see your spacecraft at the far edge of this lake ?
yes , but i' m afraid it' s broken down .
magnetic storms ruined my stabilizer .
perhaps , i can help .
i' m quite experienced mechanically .
i service and maintain this icecraft .
if you wish , i' il take you to your ship .
but there' s no wind .
hold on .
what a lovely cabin !
wind .
i' m so grateful for your help .
how can i ever thank you ?
i' m sure my government would repay you .
if there' s anything i can do , please tell me .
you could let me make love to you .
make love ?
yes .
you don' t even know my psycho cardiogram .
on earth people don' t make love ... ... unless their psycho cardiograms are in perfect confluence .
you asked me what you could do for me .
and i told you .
all right .
but i don' t see what good it will do .
do you have any pills ?
pills ?
never mind , i have some here .
what is this pill ?
an exaltation transference pill , of course .
i know nothing of this .
i see .
on earth when our psycho cardiograms are in harmony for lovemaking ... ... we take an exaltation transference pill .
and remain like this .
here let me show you .
for one minute or until full rapport is achieved .
i don' t care for that .
this is what i mean ... the bed !
that ?
but nobody' s done that for centuries !
except the poor who can' t afford the pill or psycho cardiograms .
why not ?
it impedes maximum efficiency .
also substitutes for ego support and self esteem are now available .
so , you won' t do it ?
if you insist , i guess so .
but there' s really no point at all in doing it like this .
without your garments , please .
oh .
now i' il have a look at your stabilizers .
since your garment is torn , help yourself to my furs , barbarella .
i think i' ve found the trouble .
you may proceed now to sogo .
it' s there you will find duran duran jr .
if he still lives ...
good .
now , barbarella , don' t you agree with me ... ... that in some things , the old fashioned ways are best ?
what ... ?
oh , that .
yes , i must admit it was rather interesting .
still , it is distracting .
are you coming with me to sogo ?
no , i prefer the tranquility of weir .
sogo is too strict , the people too dedicated .
perhaps you' il stop here again ... at the end of your mission .
yes , perhaps i will ...
well , goodbye .
and thanks again ...
for everything .
it was my pleasure .
please advise present situation .
you wouldn' t understand .
stabilizer' s malfunctioning .
i' ve been repaired in reverse .
we' re going in .
i' il activate the terra screw .
barbarella !
barbarella !
full operational power on all subterranean systems .
45 degree ascent .
quarter to half for surfacing .
got to get rid of this tail .
i' m dead .
no .
where am i ?
in the labyrinth of the city of night .
are you an angel ?
i' m pygar , the last ornithanthrope .
how do you do ?
and you ?
i' m from planet earth .
my name is barbarella .
but you' re soft and warm .
we' re told that earth beings are cold .
not all of us ...
my poor spaceship .
look at it .
i' m so sorry .
pygar , what happened to your eyes ?
i fell during a magnetic storm and was carried off to sogo .
sogo ?
the city of night ruled by the great tyrant .
there they blinded me .
i was left to die in the labyrinth until professor ping found me .
that' s terrible .
can you really fly ? .
no , i' ve lost the will to fly .
how awful !
it no longer matters .
it' s the past .
have you heard of duran duran ?
duran duran ?
yes , duran duran .
he' s an astronaut from earth .
i do not know of such things .
perhaps professor ping can help .
professor ping ?
he' s very wise and knows all about sogo .
where can i find him ?
he' s with the others , eating .
he' s there .
professor ping ?
professor ping ?
yes ?
my name is barbarella .
tell me .
what is your origin ?
you have the aspect of an earthling .
you are of female gender , right ?
that is correct .
is that an orchid ?
yes .
orchids have very little food value and are hard to grow in this climate .
it amuses the great tyrant to resent the expense of feeding orchids to slaves .
what kind of place is this ?
that is sogo , the city of night ... ... ruled by the great tyrant and dedicated to evil in every form .
and this is the labyrinth .
all that is not evil is exiled to the labyrinth .
look !
who is that gentleman ?
that is a grand grotesque .
that' s the classic way of ending life in the labyrinth .
professor ping , have you ever heard of duran duran ?
duran duran from earth ?
yes , indeed .
he' s alive ?
where ?
in sogo , no doubt .
i must go there at once .
but as you' ve seen , no one may leave the labyrinth .
i have a spaceship , if only it worked .
my child , perhaps i can help you .
if only you could ...
let me take you there .
pygar , will you show us the way ? .
what seems to be the trouble ?
i think it' s the stabilizers .
let' s have a look .
pygar , pen ...
here ...
thank you .
thank heaven the hypodontical molecules are undamaged .
will it take long ?
hours ?
days ?
weeks ?
who knows ?
genius is mysterious .
i can' t wait weeks .
pygar ?
you can fly me there .
no , i can' t .
atrophy of the greater alea muscle .
the angel is aerodynamically sound .
it' s all a question of morale .
there' s nothing to do but wait .
pygar , where do you live ?
come .
i' il tell you how to lead me .
just ahead .
it' s a nest .
why , yes .
that' s where i live .
it' s marvelous .
i' m glad you like it .
wait !
they' re coming .
help !
pygar , right in front of you .
pygar , no , to the right .
now !
what is it ?
one of great tyrant' s black guards .
there isn' t anybody in there .
no , black guards are leathermen .
they' re without fleshy substance .
pygar , you saved my life .
pygar ?
pygar ...
oh , pygar !
be careful !
oh , pygar !
interesting therapy !
i' ve regained the will to fly .
i know .
oh , it was ...
it was just heavenly .
can you take me to sogo ?
but i cannot see .
i will be your eyes , pygar .
i do not believe it is possible .
we' il be shot down by black guard patrols .
not with my mini missile projector , we won' t .
are you all right , pygar ?
yes , thank you .
i don' t like the looks of that .
a little to the right .
pygar , watch out !
i got him !
to the right !
up , pygar , up ...
we can hide behind that mountain .
pygar !
pygar !
are you all right ?
yes .
just in time .
my energy box is completely dead .
are we all right now ? .
i think so .
excuse me .
we' re there !
it' s right below us .
we must land in a back street , for your sake .
to be seen in sogo with an angel would be anathema .
pygar , keep your head down .
oh my , we must find something to hide your wings .
wait , barbarella !
don' t be afraid , pygar .
i sense danger .
guard yourself .
there' s nothing .
i promise you .
come !
barbarella !
pygar , wait for me !
what do you want of me ?
oh !
hello , pretty pretty .
hello .
thank you very much .
do you want to come and play with me ?
for someone like you i charge nothing .
you' re very pretty , pretty pretty .
my name isn' t " pretty pretty " .
it' s barbarella .
have you seen an angel anywhere ?
the strange bird ?
yes .
what' s that screaming ?
a good many dramatic situations begin with screaming .
pygar !
poor pygar ...
pygar , back up .
there' s a room behind you .
they' re not following .
pygar , come .
tell me what that means .
chamber of ultimate ...
... solution " .
i don' t like the sound of that .
we' d better get out of here .
ye who have chosen to die , be welcome .
to terminate the bitterness of life , you may select from three exciting ... ... and surprising forms of death .
one of each awaits behind the doors you see before you .
if you fail to choose , you' il be given to the mathmos .
there is no appeal .
next solution .
next solution .
we' d better take the chance .
wait !
thank you very much .
you must come with me .
what is your name ?
what do you do in life ?
i' m concierge to the great tyrant .
i congratulate you on your timing .
that wasn' t me .
that was ordained by the great tyrant .
i see .
what is that horrible thing under the floor ? .
that is the mathmos , my child .
the mathmos ?
you really are from earth .
you don' t understand .
no .
the mathmos ...
the whole city is built over a lake .
a very curious lake .
composed like you and i of living energy ... ... but energy in liquid form .
and it watches us .
it is magnetic .
being positively charged , it feeds on negative psychic vibrations .
what you would call " evil " .
it thrives on evil thoughts , deeds and flesh .
in return , it gives us warmth , light and life itself .
but it has a terrible appetite .
perhaps you' il see some other time .
pygar !
pygar !
don' t be concerned .
you' il see him again soon .
now , if you' il just come this way .
here , sit .
i' m afraid you must do as i say .
there , sit .
forward ...
please .
oh , moxys ...
what ?
look , moxys .
the earthling .
you get her .
get her now .
the concierge will never let us .
he always spoils our fun .
let' s try anyway .
play with us , earthling .
you must play with us .
we have lots of dolls .
my god , what are they doing here ?
stomoxys and glossina are nieces of the great tyrant .
they' re highly favored in our court .
why not with us ?
that' s not fair .
the great tyrant goes first , children .
we saw her first .
be good , girls .
stomoxys , glossina ... stay by me .
so , my pretty pretty , we meet again .
you ... !
the little one eyed wench .
you have a good memory , pretty pretty .
sometimes i like to go among my people ... be like them .
ordinary .
evil , as you call it .
so , i' m your little one eyed wench .
i' m also the great tyrant .
well , that' s nice .
it amuses me immensely .
now , you want some privileged information about a certain man , yes ?
yes , i' m here on the orders of the president of the republic of earth .
i' m here to find duran duran .
i don' t mean him , but the angel !
pygar ? .
yes , pygar .
he has escaped the labyrinth .
crime !
he' s destroyed 12 of my black guards .
crime !
and he dares to deprive me of a pleasure unique in sogo ... ... an earthling .
crime !
crime !
where is pygar ? .
you want your fine feathered friend ?
there he is .
pygar !
amusing , isn' t it , pretty pretty ? .
don' t you feel like playing ?
pretty pretty ...
you can play with us if you want .
yes , why not !
good , pretty pretty .
the mathmos is having its effect on you already .
it' s the fumes .
they make one want to play .
decrucify the angel !
what ?
decrucify him or i' il melt your face !
my face !
my beautiful face ...
stop or i' il shoot .
stop !
my face !
i warn you .
how dare you endanger my face !
observe her power buckle , your majesty .
depleted .
this weapon is as harmless as a child' s toy .
so , it was a trick , was it ?
you should have saved your tricks for ...
for the birds , your majesty ? .
yes , the birds .
the birds .
give it to the birds .
you must ...
tell me , my fancy , fuzzy freak .
what do you think of when you make love to barbarella ?
make love ?
i do not understand .
don' t be coy with me .
you are in no position .
if only you had one eye , you would see what a delight i am .
my face , my body .
all my things are a delight .
an exquisite delight .
what is it you want ?
i shall share my delights with you .
you shall make love to me .
an angel doesn' t make love .
an angel is love .
then you' re a dead duck .
guards !
to the mathmos with this winged fruitcake .
come along ...
get inside .
oh , how darling .
oh , my ...
help !
help !
this is really much too poetic a way to die .
password , quickly .
i don' t understand .
you' re a political prisoner ? .
i don' t think so .
are you not one of us ?
i' m from earth .
earth ... ?
planet of the revolutions .
will you join our cause ?
what cause ?
who are you ?
i' m dildano , head of the revolutionary forces .
this is our headquarters .
long live the revolution !
the revolution !
patrol report .
second level immediately ...
no , take the secret passage .
the door !
are you typical of earth women ?
i' m about average .
how did i get out of the bird cage ?
through a secret escape chute .
we' ve established secret escape chutes throughout the city .
it' s for the protection of our group .
you realize you saved my life .
a life without cause is without effect .
i' m sure my government would repay you .
earthwoman , shall i tell you what i would like ?
i think i know .
no !
not like that .
like on earth ... the pill .
i have the pill !
but ...
couldn' t we do it your way ? .
i don' t want to change your traditions .
i' m not a savage .
the pill .
right .
five years i' ve waited for this experience .
wait !
long live the revolution !
my group must ...
hello !
sorry !
my group must have more ...
where did you get those pills ?
only earth people know of those pills .
you there ...
what news ?
my group must have more weapons before we can launch an attack .
back to position .
await your orders .
right .
you will receive your orders !
long live the revolution !
the door ... the door ...
door !
you must tell me !
did an earth person give you those pills ?
a man called duran duran ?
that' s correct .
where is he ?
he gave me the pills when he arrived .
haven' t see him since .
i think he' s alive ... probably in the castle .
do you have anything i can ...
of course , have a secret uniform .
thank you .
i was sent here by my government to find duran duran .
your government ... ?
that must mean that you have a spacecraft and weapons .
yes , of course ...
i don' t like this red .
would you lend your equipment to our cause ?
no , i couldn' t do that .
not till i' ve completed my own mission .
perhaps we can strike a bargain .
what do you mean ?
only the black queen knows the whereabouts of duran duran .
her one vulnerable moment is when she' s in her secret chamber of dreams .
chamber of dreams ?
yes .
she sleeps alone in a room above the mathmos ... ... surrounded by a wall of energy , to which she has a secret key .
there is , however , a second key , which is now in my possession .
you want to find duran duran .
i want to capture the black queen .
you follow my meaning ?
if you really have a second key , why haven' t you used it already ? .
because our forces are not yet strong enough .
to capture the black queen , we need to have a military coup .
we can do this with your weaponry and spacecraft .
get control of the black queen and you' il know where to find duran duran .
yes , i see .
good .
i need six hours to ready my attack .
first , we need to reach professor ping to find out if alpha 7 has been repaired .
easily done .
i have a secret radio transmitter .
professor ping to headquarters ...
professor ping to headquarters .
professor ping to headquar ...
no !
headquarters to professor ping ...
headquarters to professor ping .
come in , please .
this is ping .
i hear you loud and clear .
i have the earthling ...
barbarella . ... barbarella with me .
we can use her spacecraft and weaponry .
is her spacecraft in working order ? .
yes , the craft is ready for flight now .
excellent !
there is one danger , however .
a black guard patroller spotted the craft and may return to destroy it .
good heavens !
i have programmed the craft to go to a hidden location outside the labyrinth .
you' re a wizard , ping .
it' s taking off even now .
there it goes .
perfect flight pattern .
our rendez vous point is 1600 hours .
our password is ...
llanfairpwilgwyngyilgogerychwyrn drobwililantysiliogogogoch .
you mean the secret is ...
llanfairpwilgwyngyilgogerychwyrn drobwililantysiliogogogoch .
exactly !
right ?
right .
headquarters signing off .
headquarters signing off .
the time is right .
the queen is in her chamber of dreams .
what about the key ? .
the key !
there is the secret key .
where ?
it' s invisible .
only an invisible key can open an invisible wall .
where ?
my mathmos ... the key !
the key ...
i have it !
i' il put it around your secret neck .
invisible .
now , the secret map that will lead you to the 12th corridor .
what corridor ? .
good !
this way !
llanfairpwilgwyngyilgogerychwyrn drobwililantysiliogogogoch .
long live the revolution !
one moment .
i' m just not the tube type .
excuse me .
could you tell me how to get to the 12th corridor ? .
i have a taste for you .
what is it ?
essence of man .
essence of man ?
so , you escaped the birds !
just as well .
it is my turn for some amusement .
come with me .
this way , please !
what is this thing ?
you will soon see , my dear .
sonata for executioner and various young women " .
it' s ... sort of nice , isn' t it ?
yes .
it is nice ...
in the beginning .
wait until the tune changes .
it may change your tune as well .
goodness , what do you mean ?
when we reach the crescendo , you will die ... of pleasure .
your end will be swift , but sweet ... very sweet .
what is this ?
i don' t believe it .
it couldn' t be !
wretched girl ...
what have you done to my excessive machine ?
you' ve undone it .
you' ve undone me .
look , look !
energy cables are shrinking .
you' ve turned them into faggots .
you' ve burned out the excessive machine .
you' ve blown all its fuses .
my goodness !
you' ve exhausted its power .
it couldn' t keep up with you .
incredible !
what kind of girl are you ?
have you no shame ?
shame !
shame on you !
you' il pay for this .
i' ve got something for you .
you' il wish you had died of pleasure .
now you shall learn the wisdom of the lash .
haven' t you done enough to me ?
i' il do things to you that are beyond all known philosophies .
wait until i get my devices .
duran duran ?
oh , recognized me ?
recognized you ?
i' d never have recognized you .
i thought you were only 25 .
what happened ?
the mathmos is not without its effect .
but you' ve aged 30 years !
the mathmos has its own means of nourishment .
in return , it teaches truth .
dr. duran , could you hand me a garment ?
the president of the republic of earth sent me here to save you .
and to return you to earth .
earth planet ?
never !
shall i tell you why ? .
because i know too much .
here in sogo i have learned truth and essence .
i speak of the dignity , the nobility of pure evil .
my boots , please .
humanism !
morals !
principles ... !
it' s rubbish !
nonsense !
i speak only of truth and of essence .
where is the positronic ray ? .
so , that' s it .
what does it do ?
all persons and objects within its path are de miniminized to the 4th level .
you mean ... ?
that' s right .
replaced in the 4th dimension irretrievably .
but that' s monstrous !
yes , it is .
isn' t it ?
why didn' t you take power here in sogo ?
the black queen must first be destroyed .
but as you know , she is always surrounded by her black guards .
whoever succeeds in killing her will be put immediately to a horrible death .
hence , my prudence .
i find horrible the idea that one could do to me that which i do to others .
but i was told the black queen is vulnerable while she sleeps .
oh , yes .
there are no black guards in the chamber of dreams .
that' s because there' s no access to the chamber .
but , now' s time for my pleasure ... and your death .
wait !
i know how you can enter the chamber of dreams .
how ? .
speak !
i have the key .
what does it look like ?
it' s invisible .
take me to the chamber of dreams .
after you , barbarella .
to the right , barbarella ....
now , to the left ...
stop .
open it !
this must be the invisible wall .
yes .
now , where' s the key ? .
come on , stop stalling .
i' m trying to find the keyhole .
you' re trapped .
you' re trapped in the chamber of dreams .
the mathmos will devour you .
your majesty !
it' s no use .
i' ve got the two keys .
the wall' s sealed for all eternity .
dr. duran , give up this madness !
return to earth with me now .
i' il return to earth , but as its conqueror !
thanks to you , the queen , my last obstacle , has been removed .
thank you , barbarella .
nothing can stop me now .
today , master of sogo ...
tomorrow , master of the earth , master of the galaxy , master of the universe !
tell me , my fine , feathered friend , what do you think of ... ... when you make love to barbarella ?
an angel doesn' t make love .
an angel is love .
wake up , your majesty !
you must wake up .
vade retro , earthgirl !
i know you don' t really exist .
that may be , your majesty .
but we' d better stick to what we see .
wretched girl , what have you done ?
no one must enter while i sleep .
your concierge is taking over the throne .
what are you saying ?
it' s true .
he' s taken your key .
we' re locked in , your majesty .
the key .
he' s stolen the key !
we are doomed ...
doomed !
he said the mathmos would devour us .
what did he mean ?
it is said that unless i am alone in my chamber of dreams ... ... the mathmos will claim me .
it' s the throne room .
i can see all of the city and labyrinth .
unfortunately , it' s a one way screen .
no one can see that bloody dog has locked me in .
your majesty !
we' re under attack .
the creatures in the labyrinth .
they' re revolting !
how dare he interrupt my coronation !
dispatch the air armada !
quick , your majesty , the labyrinth .
it' s dildano .
he will save us .
your majesty , they' re all destroyed .
good .
not a creature left in the labyrinth .
no aircraft left !
they have earth weapons !
fool !
liar ! ldiots !
must i do everything myself ?
i must destroy this rabble .
he' il use the positronic ray .
it works !
it works ...
it works .
all is lost .
i must die , very well , but it is i who shall have the last laugh .
the imbecile doesn' t know the secret of the great tyrant .
the supreme weapon .
i shall free the mathmos .
do you think that' s wise ?
sogo will disappear .
it will be the end .
the apocalypse !
where are we ?
in the mathmos .
and alive !
i can see that , but why ? .
the mathmos created this bubble to protect itself from your innocence .
that' s nice .
no , no , stop !
i command it .
i' m duran duran .
i' m master of the mathmos .
fall back !
fall back !
i' il destroy you with my positronic ray .
you' re so good , you make the mathmos vomit .
pygar !
what did you do to pygar ? .
he was sent to the mathmos , but was no more digestible than you are .
you can' t be dead .
you win , barbarella .
but the earth has lost its last great dictator .
the genius of the positronic ray ...
why don' t you give him a mouth to mouth ?
i have a better idea .
please ...
pygar , please .
please wake up !
we must fly back to my spaceship .
do you have the strength ?
pygar , why did you save her after all the terrible things she did to you ?
an angel has no memory !
