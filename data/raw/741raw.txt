subtitles by johnny depp
on may 9 , 1969 , a mile from the northern border of laos , the 101st us army lnfantry division was advancing on hill 937 .
for them , it was just a recon mission .
for the vietcong , hill 937 was a strategic point .
the dozen soldiers in the company , new to combat , were to complete this routine mission in two hours .
they fought back heroically for 9 days .
this film does not tell their story .
the year is 35, 000 bc .
ln this untouched and savage world , mammoths live in peace with horsemoths ,
henmoths and wormoths .
oblivious to evil , fearing only the night , this is where our ancestors , the first men , lived .
all right ...
you know my wife ?
yes , chief .
beautiful , isn' t she ?
right , roll call !
this is the stone age .
stone ?
here !
stone ?
here !
absent again , that one .
stone too , i suppose .
i knew it .
always off together .
this is nice .
it' s nice being nice .
ever feel like not doing nothing ?
no .
me neither .
a quick pus ?
no thanks , i quit .
rest your head .
scared you' il mess your hair ?
your hair' s weird .
it' s a period do .

it' s always been curly , like grandpa and dad .
my children and grandchildren were too !
just swallow it .
okay .
daddy !
hello , my chickadees !
stone , have they been good ?
very .
just stoning each other as usual .
that' s good .
just a second ...
there' s one missing !
honey , didn' t we have 12 kids this morning ?
that' s right .
a wild beast gobbled stone up .
i knew we had 12 .
come on , time for bed now .
off you go .
how much , stone ?
one baby boarmoth a day .
so half a baby boarmoth .
dung !
i' m out of baby boarmoths .
that feels so good ...
take that thing .
keep the change .
it' s getting all dark !
knock it off !
hurry , night is sprawling .
it' s getting all dark !
knock it off !
it' s getting all dark !
knock it off !
you kids can' t watch the mural all night .
lights out .
nearby , among the barren red rocks ,
lives a tribe with dirty , muddy hair .
for centuries , the dirtyhairs have been at war with their neighbours , for the latter hold the secret of shampoo .
despite this ancient conflict , the cleanhairs feel on first name terms with happiness .
charge !
it really needs a hole .
baby , i' m home .
well ?
failed again .
same here .
as usual .
the others ?
all drowned .
what ?
unky , unky , unky , aunty and unky ?
unky too .
unky too ?
we' ve lost half our family tree !
extinction looms .
just give the shampoo thing a rest .
i don' t see why we can' t manage it .
i just don' t see why .
looks like the shit fairies blessed us .
this shampoo war has lasted 800 years .
800 years on the 25th .
we must break the circle of failure .
here' s what i suggest .
what do you think ?
you didn' t say anything .
right , sorry .
here' s what i suggest ...
we' il take a hostage !
what do you think ?
hi , stone .
why bother ?
we' re the first men , i tell you .
i' m on a dig .
what ?
just practising ...
you know my wife ?
beautiful , isn' t she ?
healologist , bless this hunt .
sorry , that' s gibberish .
it' s a new language i made up .
didn' t the old one work ?
boring ...
my the hnt be gd nd my nbdy die .
what' s with the accent ?
it' s my new language .
the accent tends to linger .
hunt and fish well .
may meat flow like water !
don' t sit up and beg .
don' t sit up and beg .
good yorkimoth .
so how do you like your women , like ?
alive .
well , my ideal dream woman would be ... a girl .
be more specific .
someone like me .
meaning ?
well , me .
for a woman like that , i' d do crazy things .
such as ?
such as stroke her hand .
where are you going ?
there may be eggs in it .
we' il say we hunted them for shampoo .
come on .
you swim like a dogmoth .
we show the chief ?
no , he' il make us hunt .
let' s wait the day out .
how d' you rate the chief' s wife ?
she scares me .
she turns me on .
leave it , honey , i' il bring the meat in later .
lf we keep hunting those , they' il be extinct .
chief !
you know my wife ?
beautiful , isn' t she ?
anyway ...
we were hunting ...
yes , we were hunting and hunting and hunting ...
eggs ...
and as we were hunting ...
we found this for you from the dirtyhair chief .
put it down !
gently !
put it down and freeze !
l have no choice but to take a hostage .
l' ve kidnapped myself .
my hand proves it .
give me the recipe for shampoo by sundown ...
... or i' il execute myself .
numbskull .
you skipped hunting again today .
ln what way ?
you two really underdo it .
gross .
my dad' s blubbing .
give me the recipe by sundown or i' il execute myself .
he said it , he did it .
a great man .
great moron , more like .
farewell , lucy .
it' s getting all dark !
knock it off !
dung !
i forget every time .
it' s you !
i' il put a light on .
it' s so dark in here .
it' s good to see y ...
that hurts !
but it' s good to see you .
can i get you anyth ... ?
stopped working ?
the chief' s mad she didn' t come to babysit .
move yourselves , excuse me .
move yourselves , excuse me .
move me , excuse yourselves .
excuse me !
watch it !
why make such a mammoth fuss over one dead woman ?
all this mobbing and sobbing !
animals eat people every day .
this was no animal .
it was !
may i agree with you both ?
it was an animal ?
wasn' t .
was !
it wasn' t an animal !
it was !
look !
stop squabbling like infants .
i' ve never seen such infantry !
let me see it .
the dead body , i mean .
i didn' t get what he meant .
did you ?
lf animals attack in caves now ...
shut up about animals !
she' s whole !
an animal would' ve eaten her .
unless he' d just had lunch !
or was anorexic .
we all have relatives who' ve been eaten !
a animal kills to eat !
that' s wrong .
wrong ?
come here , blondy .
see that bearmoth ?
get up !
up , slob !
i said " wrong " because he said " a animal " .
lf an animal didn' t kill her , maybe a vegetable did .
i' ve got it !
look !
she died of old age ... but young .
sure !
makes sense .
i' il leave you to bury the body .
no !
this woman died by the hand of man !
the hand of man ?
nobody ever killed a body .
they just did .
stay .
all her orifices are sewn up .
even her toes ?
toes aren' t orifices .
why do we say " socket toe me " ?
we don' t .
and here' s the bloody club that killed her .
you can touch .
it' s stopped working .
a man killed another man .
and a woman , at that !
wait .
i have an idea .
let' s swap places .
this is something unheard of .
i' m going to call it a " crime " .
it just came to me .
i could say " murder " , but no .
i like " crime " .
me too .
what nonsense !
i can see the point of stroking a cheek or shuffling pebbles but why bother to kill a person ?
she' d have died anyway , sooner or later .
it' s ridiculous !
why ridiculous ?
it' s new .
novelty' s always ...
i can see the point of frolicking ...
we got it .
we must find out who did it .
what for ?
to ask him why he did it .
that hurt .
are you sure , chief ?
i' m the new chief .
i decide new stuff from now on .
but it' s cruel !
you want silky hair or not , for dung' s sake ?
now .
what' s the singular of hair ?
hair .
it' s too cruel .
i' m hideous !
you' re gorgeous .
at least you look like him .
i can' t go to the cleanhairs like this .
you' il go .
and you' il what ?
seduce him , bring back the shampoo
and take care of myself .
that' s right .
i' ve lost a son already .
enough' s enough .
that shaved sheep looks like a pig .
get going , because ...
why do i do that ?
who ?
come on !
whoever did it , own up !
well ?
i don' t mind waiting .
i' m waiting !
you' re a lousy waiter .
you' re the worst waiter i ever saw .
give it a rest .
come on , out with it !
what' s up ?
i was diggologing .
the chief wants to know who did it to know why i did it .
see , i was diggologing ...
whoever says he did it ,
i' il give him ... a sandwich !
what kind of sandwich ?
strawberry .
had an idea ?
no .
your foot' s on my hair .
we can find the crimer even if he doesn' t own up .
easy !
we know she was killed by a club .
so the crimer must be a club owner .
we know she was sewn up
like my yorkimoth .
maybe a dirtyhair did it .
they can' t sew , so .
sew !
a seamstress did it .
a club owning seamstress .
a club owning seamstress !
so !
we just need to find a seamstress who recently bought a club .
you two hulks !
go to the clubbery .
but it' s three days ' walk !
no rush .
give yourselves three days .
three days ' walk makes six days there and back .
he didn' t ask us to come back .
dear stones !
this death will change our lives forever but life must go on as before !
doe ball , anyone ?
mine !
it' s fine to say " mine ! " but it' s better to play it , okay ?
blondy , foul !
i didn' t even touch it !
foul .
we' il send it back .
new doe !
skip the " blondy " .
call me stone .
go , moppet !
mine !
you' re my dream girl all over .
wanna see my booty ?
are you old ?
stop !
it' s a beauty spot .
beauty spots ... are proof of beauty .
what are you up to ?
this is stone , stone ...
he' s stone too , or " blondy " behind his back .
who' s she ?
guy .
who ?
how d' you pronounce it ?
sto o one .
no , more like " guy " .
more like " guy " .
no , " gay " .
whose name is it anyway ?
what tribe are you from , guy ?
the tribe at the end of the earth , where you fall off .
i' ve heard of that .
my whole tribe fell off , including me .
except me .
yeah ?
well , goodbye .
c' mon !
whose serve ?
goodbye ?
we have to let her stay .
we can' t feed her .
they all fell off the earth !
you want her to go home and slide off too ?
okay , she can stay .
but he goes .
why me ?
so the bald one' s your chief .
no , i am !
i' ve had a wonderful day .
since the moment we met ,
i' ve felt that survival' s worth surviving .
the sweet air , the birdmothsong , etc ?
how did you know ?
how advanced was your tribe ?
very .
we were about to discover religion .
and how advanced were you ?
oh , i already asked .
are we nearly there ?
here we are .
you can sleep in the dead woman' s cave .
lsn' t there a lot better one ?
okay , then .
good night .
i nearly forgot !
i love you .
i can' t live without you either .
come , let' s freshen up .
let' s what ?
let' s wash your hair .
your curls aren' t even natural !
sorry , i never get fresh on a first date .
it' s getting all dark .
knock it off .
only 2 and 3/ 4 more days to the clubbery .
tell me ...
sorry , i keep forgetting your name .
stone .
i' m tempted to buy a small club while we' re at it .
you' il pay more for a big one .
hi , mum .
hi , dad .
hi , darling .
no fruit ?
yes .
want some ?
sleep well ?
i dreamed i had dark hair .
poor dear !
i' ve been sleeping so badly .
want to sleep with us tonight ?
i' m too old for it .
still ...
i wouldn' t mind sleeping with you when dad' s dead .
pass the bisonette milk .
i left some for you but i finished it .
finished it ?
thanks !
i' m treated like a stranger in this house .
we' il have to tell him the truth .
he' s not ready yet .
hi blondy .
my name' s stone !
want a butterflap ?
it' s a dried butterfly .
show me your hand .
which one ?
look !
i' ve got baby fingers on this hand too !
you like leaves ?
me too !
let' s get going .
can i tell you a short poem ?
the sky .
pretty !
the beginning' s weak .
" the " is good .
will you give me some shampoo ?
when ?
get gathering , slackers !
we are .
get up !
supposing you were lying down .
you' re giving her shampoo ?
you' re out of your mind !
you only met her yesterday .
at least get her pregnant first .
suit yourself .
guy loves me !
i' m a couple now .
all this digging must lead somewhere .
bones !
bones with skin on !
it' s getting all dark !
knock it off !
dung !
dark already .
lizardslaw anyone ?
trunk and pickles for me .
that one .
lovely nosh .
delicious , except for the mud ones .
chief !
another corpse has been crimed !
who ?
stone .
our diggologist ?
i found him .
i was alone .
nobody else saw him .
two deaths .
this is getting troublesome .
who' il be next ?
you .
and then you .
and you .
that' s okay .
but then it' il be me and that' il be sad .
the sitter drew a crowd .
the first one was a real letdown so the sequel won' t be a hit .
go ahead , i' ve already seen it .
ah , healologist ...
you know my wife ?
beautiful , isn' t she ?
well ?
nasty !
not at all .
want to see where i was sitting ?
look , he' s been sewn up , like the sitter .
yes , indeed ...
lnteresting coincidence .
it' s like that old crime two days ago .
he only stitched one nostril .
it must be his half brother .
maybe he was disturbed by that moron of a watcher .
nothing personal .
lf it' s the same crimer , then ...
bump ...
hurt ...
horror ...
stopping ...
criming ...
sewing ...
people ...
the horror ...
horror has a face .
that' s enough of that !
you two !
find the crimer !
stop there !
why us two ?
i' m too cowardly right now .
bald and cowardly at once .
do we need miss judgmental ?
it' s okay , i' il see to the crimer .
of course .
find him and i' il let you off hunting .
i' il let you off for life .
i' il let you off for life , plus a few days .
it' s a deal .
how do you express joy ?
find me the crimer .
fast .
thought we wouldn' t guess ?
okay , i confess .
why did you crime them ?
answer us !
that' s good .
do that when you find him .
as for ...
that' s enough .
watch it !
don' t point !
ask your thing to shut up .
i' ve had a wonderful day .
thanks for the advice .
no sweat .
coming ...
can we see your dominant male ?
he' s over there .
hi .
can we ask you a few questions ?
fire away .
can you tell us what happened ?
as usual , i was saying , " it' s getting all dark .
knock it off .
the diggologist didn' t say ...
knock it off .
right .
so i went to check .
when i stepped inside , he was already ...
dead .
you have to say " dead " .
otherwise it makes no sense .
dead .
anything else ?
yes .
i saw a man running away .
which way ?
from behind .
let' s pick up all the guys with behinds .
back up .
face the wall .
remember my shampoo .
don' t worry , doll face , i' il give you what you want .
you' re going to see some possible suspects .
hold this for me , i' m a witness .
it' s getting all dark !
not yet .
what if the crimer recognizes me ?
we' ve thought of that .
you' il see them from behind this one way rock .
who turned that guy around ?
scram , you' re innocent .
you know my wife ?
beautiful , isn' t she ?
well , do you recognize him ?
all these rocks look alike .
shall we move it ?
no , he mustn' t see me .
how about a fake beard ?
beards don' t suit me .
shift the one way rock .
don' t scratch the ground , dear !
well ?
how can i recognize their behinds ?
it' il be tougher than i thought .
thanks anyway .
lf you leave the tribe , tell us .
of course .
lf you need anything , even just a drink ,
drop by my cave .
you know we won' t .
too busy ?
too choosy .
my duckymoth !
that woman scarifies me .
you know we hang out ?
know what i' m thinking ?
we used to walk on four feet , now we walk on two feet .
maybe soon we' il walk on no feet .
this one here .
this one' s good ...
not bad .
excellent !
got it in beige ?
ln beige ?
did a seamstress buy a club recently ?
going my way ?
how about this one ?
you recognize the watcher because he has a torch .
now we have a job , we need something to be recognized by .
you' re right .
a torch !
these !
what was it i wanted to say ?
yes .
let' s recap .
what do we know so far ?
how to make fire .
we' re pretty good at inventing tools .
true , too .
dung !
she' s just having fun !
about the crime ...
the victim was disembowelled .
fine .
but why take his guts ?
to make guitar strings .
we' re all on edge .
it' s interesting .
go on .
guitar strings and ...
so a guitarist did it .
a seamstress sewed them up .
a guitarist seamstress .
not bad !
you' re smart , guy .
you' re amazing .
wait till you see me pee standing up .
find me the guitarist seamstress who did it .
i was kidding .
where do we find a guitarist seamstress ?
the strum' n' stitch school .
hem in f sharp again .
c major .
embroidery !
f sharp .
she stays here .
yes , it could be dangerous .
lf i don' t come back , you can have custody of the kids .
we have none .
more free time for you , then .
cross stitch .
semiquaver .
we' re investigating the double crime with more than one victim .
don' t mind us .
guitar stitching is like milk carving .
keep it natural !
try to mind us a bit .
start again .
c major .
f sharp : cross stitch .
look at her .
who ?
the middle one .
so ?
i don' t trust her .
why not ?
i dunno .
lntuition .
lnstinct .
stitch !
strum !
stitch !
it' s simple enough !
lf your hem goes during a recital , what then ?
who' il be sniggering then ?
it' s her .
now !
grab her !
and the dung hits the fan !
the branches go over it , not at the bottom .
it' s getting all dark !
knock it off !
good night .
hi , how are you ?
i' m pooped .
i was here .
me , here .
and me , just about here .
thanks a lot !
all night waiting !
this story sucks .
pinch her !
shitess !
are you happy with my work as watcher ?
very .
and my work as witness ?
very .
would you rather i continued as a watcher or a witness ?
very very .
now tell us why you did it , okay ?
your move .
i can' t play .
i' m working .
coffee ?
i' d prefer something with more bite .
i' m glad it' s all over .
it' s not over for everyone .
i didn' t like you much at first .
as time goes by , i' m getting to loathe you .
funny you said that ' cause it' s not very funny .
stone ?
try miming it with words .
won' t that confuse things ?
try it .
the trout goes upstream step by step !
better .
now try using words that fit the topic .
why did you kill those two women ?
lncluding a man !
good !
got the hang of it ?
yes .
i had the hang of it before , too .
good work .
this bit wasn' t right .
get some rest .
you' re staying till you tell us why !
so it' s been confirmed ?
the killer isn' t a vegetable ?
keep a close eye on her .
i love your breath .
will you have it tomorrow ?
the investigation' s over !
to celebrate , i suggest we all go and celebrate !
a happy hippo meal for everyone !
so let' s go !
i' m going .
we are gathered together ...
please !
we' re all here to celebrate the end of this gruelling but short inquiry , thanks to her without whom it could never have happened ,
stone the murderette !
thanks .
it wasn' t me .
still , thanks for your warm welcome .
you' re all equally nice people , especially the pretty boy .
good eat !
1 7 minutes later
actually , i did the witnessing on your latest crime .
what makes a good witness ?
three things .
look , see , see .
look seeing you now , i see your front and back are different shapes .
1 1 minutes later
we forgot to invite the healologist .
join us and consider yourself invited two hours ago .
what are you feasting ?
wrong !
what are you eating .
we' ve found the culprit .
let me introduce her .
you' il pay for this !
no , it' s my treat .
was he like that before ?
no , he wasn' t not like that .
what happened to his stuffed thing ?
nobody knows how it died .
night watcher or witness ?
given the choice ...
7 minutes later
... friends and family .

greedyguts !
doesn' t the chief suspect anything ?
can i sleep at your place tonight ?
what for ?
i feel sleepy .
the trouble is ...
no time later
there' s only one bed .
no problem .
i' il sleep between your wife and you .
lf i don' t mind , i don' t see why not .
which hand ?
wait !
let me check .
why' ve you got a chicken bone there ?
why' s that chicken bone there ?
it' s to twiddle your hair !
i don' t think so .
how pathetic !
he twiddles his hair !
he' s not naturally curly !
hey , curly !
you rotten dirtyhair !
that' s right !
dirtyhair !
put that in your pipe !
i knew all along why your hair smells of poo but i kept quiet ' cause i thought you were different and that under your dirt , you deserved to be ... clean .
but you' re like all of your tribe .
dirty dirty !
wait !

but if she' s not , there' s no point ,
i reckon !
then again ...
sorry to interrupt .
go ahead .
lt' s just to say i' m killing tomorrow .
give him to me .
who are you killing ?
it' s a surprise .
where will you do it ?
tricky question .
let' s say i' il do it here , where i am now .

he' s one and we' re a lot .
what ?
take it from me !
let me talk to him .
okay , i' il tell him .
well then ?

tomorrow we stake out the bog .
not too early .
you two !
to witness the crime , we' il ...

we' re a tribe !
you' re a tribe !
you' re a tribe !
i' m a tribe !
one last thing .

it' s getting all dark .
as i was saying , we' il need to wear camouflage .
what' s wrong ?
your camouflage !
i' m a frog .
there' s no such thing as a six foot frogmoth .
only because i' m standing up .
look .
keep it down !
i' m not really a chick .
i' m the chief .
you know my wife ?
she' s not here .
why not ?
too risky .
the kids are minding her .
right !
there' s a 9/ 10 chance he' il come from there , 9/ 10 he' il come from there , and 9/ 10 from there .
that makes a 27/ 30 chance he' il come ... from there .
so we' re ideally placed .
knock it off .
aren' t you going to the bog ?
the chief asked me to but i' m not in the mood .
you can' t witness everything .
you must be upset , though .
lsn' t it getting all dark yet ?
i' d be upset if i were you .
pity your wife' s not here .
i could have pok ...
what' s dungface doing here ?
you called my daughter a dirty dirty !
nobody does that !
nobody calls my girl a dirty dirty .
proud of yourself ?
stigmatizing people for their looks ?
hooray for racial supremacy !
fine role models you are !
sophisticates !
let' s be reasonable .
you be quietable !
yes , we have dirty hair but we give lice a home .
you think you' re so great with your tresses and gloss !
you' re disgusting .

i' m going back to scratch my head with pride .

where' s the crimer got to ?
he' s letting us down .
what' s the matter ?
i' m wandering aimlessly .
because of guy ?

i cherished the hope of adopting her .
i' m against adoption .
you' re a fine one to talk .
