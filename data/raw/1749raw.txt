there either is or is not a way things are .
the color of the day .

did you see anything like that ?
no .

we' il tow you in .
that was the end of it .
perhaps you had an experience like that as a child and told no one .

dinsmoor was weirder than usual , but i had to see estella .
i never come here .
never .
do you know why ?
twenty six years ago , i trusted .
i saved myself .
i was a virgin .
it' s funny , huh ?
those were the times , that' s how i was raised .
what kind of creature takes such a thing , such a gift , a trust ?
who does this ?
takes advantage of a 42 year old woman ?
what kind of creature leaves this woman waiting like a fool ?
a man does this , so men must pay .
am i right ?
estella will make men weep .
do you know where she is ?
she' il break them .
i taught her well .
when she returns , she' il cut through them like a hot knife through butter .
returns ?
oh , my dear boy !
didn' t you know ?
she' s left for school .
switzerland for two years , then paris .
didn' t she say goodbye ?
i' m sure she meant to .
see you next week , dear .
seven years passed .
i stopped going to paradiso perduto .
i stopped painting .
i put aside fantasy and the wealthy ... ... and the heavenly girl who did not want me .
none of it would happen to me again .
i' d seen through it .
i elected to grow up .
finn !
this is jerry ragno .
jerry , mr. ragno is a lawyer in miami .
and new york .
we have offices in manhattan .
so , finn ... ... i' m empowered by my client to make your dreams come true .
really ?
any particular dream or just all of them ?
have you ever shown your work ?
no .
they had finn' s painting at washington federal bank .
eight years ago .
i gave all that up .
i don' t understand what this is about .
how would you like a one man show at the thrall gallery ?
my client , erica thrall , wants you in new york for a one man show .
have you ever sent slides to the thrall gallery ?
i sent slides everywhere in high school .
they made an impression .
a ticket to new york ... ... plus $1000 for incidentals .
sorry , they' re all in hundreds .
the hundreds aren' t the problem .
i just ...
i don' t paint anymore .
whose business was it what i did with my life ?
who' d gotten my life in order ?
me .
i was in control .
and everything i wanted , i had .
ms. dinsmoor ?
are cocktails ready , thomas ?
no , it' s me .
it' s finn .
i came ...
looking for estella .
that hook is in deep , isn' t it , dear ?
i came to ask you a question .
after nearly 10 years without a word , without a visit ... ... you' ve come to interrogate me .
how interesting .
i' m sorry .
things happened .
the love of your life left you .
it hurts , doesn' t it ?
come closer .
i' ve gone red .
i noticed .
it' s nice .
and look at you .
all grown up .
a man .
ms. dinsmoor , a lawyer named ragno came to see me .
the spider .
do you know him ?
ragno " means " spider " in italian .
you must learn other languages .
he represents an art gallery owner in new york who wants to show my work .
you can draw .
can' t dance worth a shit , but you can draw .
did you know anything about this ?
estella is in new york .
i doubt our paths will cross .
so you' re going ?
should i ?
i remember watching you from that very window .
scared little mouse scurrying across my garden and through my front door .
now another door opens .
what will our mouse do ?
i expect an invitation .
i' m sorry ?
to your opening , your show .
what equipment are you flying ?
what ?
is it a wide body or a 767 ?
i' ve no idea , i just hope it stays up there .
you' d better get on .
yeah .
what happens if i get up there and i can' t deliver ?
finn .
there' s nothing harder than being given your chance .
at least that' s what i hear .
yeah ?
taxi !
have you got change for a dollar ?
what ?
fuck you !
fuck you !
fuck you , man !
fuck you !
well , then , there i was .
ms. dinsmoor , as my secret benefactor , sent me to new york to draw .
to have the girl , to have it all .
and i looked out on the great city , as so many before , which held it all .
and it was that close , and it was mine .
liebchen , guten morgen . " are you still holding the red and green picasso ?
i think i have somebody interested .
no , i can' t say right now .
just the picasso .
fabelhaft .
danke .
here' s where you show me your work , darling .
i told you , i don' t have any .
then you' d better get busy .
why am i here ?
you saw some slides ?
i gave keith haring a show after he drew a sketch in my hand .
but which paintings did you like ?
i saw the beginning of something , and here you are .
annette , sotheby' s .
what you do is up to you .
stay and paint or enjoy the sights and go home .
either way , i always enjoy meeting a young painter .
look , i mean , i' il do it .
i said that i' il do the paintings .
wonderful .
call marcy when you have something for us .
and i could still draw .
nothing had lessened it as much as i had abused it , abandoned it .
it was a gift , and it was still mine .
and everything else was less real .
what can it mean ?
that picture of the world .
but when it' s true , we recognize it in ourselves , in others .
we recognize it , like love , completely undeserved .
you' re drooling .
so , finn bell .
in new york .
that' s right .
i thought i saw you last christmas .
i was driving down 5th .
i just got here .
actually , now that i see you , this guy was bigger .
he' s bigger .
fatter .
he had long hair .
you thought it was me ?
i hadn' t seen you in years .
it has been a while .
and here we are .
i have to run .
wait , maybe we could ...
tomorrow at the borough club around 6 .
i' m meeting some friends .
if you' re free , that is .
i' m free .
i' m glad you' re here .
a long time ago there lived two brilliant artists .
true geniuses .
one day one of them was painting out in the forest ... ... and he came upon this dog who was crying , obviously lost .
a puppy .
yes , sure .
a puppy , fine .
he couldn' t concentrate anyway , so he scooped the puppy up ... ... and took him into town to find its owner ... ... who turned out to be the prince of the kingdom ... ... who was eternally grateful and very wealthy .
that artist' s name was michelangelo .
true story .
the other artist' s name was ...
nobody knows , he was never heard from again .
right , that' s so true , walter .
can i smoke ?
it' s your last one .
that' s all right .
so you ...
cigarette , please .
you' re from florida too ?
yes .
everybody is from florida .
i' m not , i hate florida .
too much sun .
really ?
actually , finn was my childhood ...
what were you exactly ?
he was my first love .
if that' s what you say .
he painted a beautiful portrait of me when i was 10 .
i sat for a portrait once .
electric .
you sucked off de kooning !
i' d like to paint you again .
would you ?
i want to paint your portrait .
what do you think , sweetheart ?
me ?
well , gee .
do you charge by the inch or by the hour ?
what ?
how do you price your art ?
by its size , square footage , or the time it takes to make ... ... the art ?
i' ve actually never sold a painting .
excuse me , sir !
please , sir .
excuse me , sir .
that' s a club jacket you have on , this is your jacket .
let me help you .
thank you .
what are you doing here ?
don' t you want to paint me ?
you' ve slept all day .
it' s time to work .
do you want to do it right now ?
mm hm .
okay .
how did you get in here ?
they just let you in , huh ?
it' s not top of the line security .
do you want me sitting or standing ?
both .
i mean , whatever .
sitting .
i have to go .
i have dinner in one hour and i look a mess .
what are you doing ?
you forgot your shoes .
what is it like not to feel anything ?
get the fuck out of here !
say there was a little girl .
and from the time she could understand , she was taught to fear .
say she was taught to fear daylight .
she was taught it was her enemy , that it would hurt her .
and then one sunny day ... ... you ask her to go outside and play , and she won' t .
can you be angry at her ?
i knew that girl , saw the light in her eyes .
that' s still what i see .
we are who we are .
people don' t change .
yeah , hold on .
what is it ?
yeah ?
hi , finn .
walter .
i know .
is this a bad time for you ?
i can ...
it' s all right , come on in .
are you sure ?
yeah , come on in .
thank you .
what are you doing here ?
estella said she posed for you .
and i ... ... was curious .
wow !
you' re really good .
i had a good subject .
yeah , i' il say .
she is incredible .
i' ve got to be insane , right ?
why ?
to risk losing her .
god , look at that one !
look at this .
and i still can' t commit .
that' s certifiable , right ?
you don' t look crazy to me .
i feel like a cliff diver in acapulco .
i' m right at the edge , i' m supposed to leap , the tide is high ... ... and i think your friend estella is trying to give me a little shove .
what do you mean ?
you know , these , you ...
it' s her charming little version of a wake up call .
but , you know , i understand .
i' m dragging my feet .
i' m sorry you got pulled into this mess .
she doesn' t want to hurt you .
in fact , i know that she really cares about you .
really .
it' s just who she is , you know ?
but i love her .
i don' t know .
you know her longer than i. any advice for me ?
what do you think i should do about me and estella ?
i think you two are perfect together .
well , thank you .
i should get out of your hair .
i appreciate your time .
you' re really good .
i look forward to seeing your show .
next week , i received a postcard from ms. dinsmoor .
a beach with palm trees , it said , " how' s my little mouse doing ?
what were her plans for me ?
why was she promoting me ?
what could her reason be , if not to make me equal with estella ?
that same day , i got a call from ragno .
hello ?
in here .
what do you think of the digs ?
it' s cozy .
it' s yours .
what do you mean ?
you open in 10 weeks .
we can reschedule , if ...
no , i' il be ready .
you' re moving here .
we' ve got food , paint , canvas .
anything else , just ask erica .
do you know what i' d like ?
i' d like some money .
some living expenses .
i don' t believe ...
done .
anything else ?
some publicity for my show .
no one' s actually heard of you .
fisherman from the gulf coast lands on manhattan' s art scene " ?
my , aren' t we media savvy .
we learn .
call marion , she' il know .
toast in my absence , i' m late .
she' s a barrel of laughs .
an artist dropped out , she had to redo her schedules .
it' s like someone wants to turn this frog into a prince .
what do you mean ?
you know what i mean .
it appears as if i have a fairy godmother .
aren' t you too old to believe in fairy godmothers ?
whatever you say , spider man .
ragno " means " spider " in italian .
see you at your opening .
ciao .
i was born again .
why not ?
i had never asked for anything .
if dinsmoor , the art world and the world chose to adopt me ... ...
i could take it .
new york held it out , and i' d take it and say thanks .
you would too .
i was an orphan , raised by my sister maggie and her boyfriend joe .
maggie took off when i was still a kid .
joe was a big drug smuggler .
spent the ' 70s in the raiford penitentiary .
i came home one day , i found him dead on the couch .
he had od' d .
they took the apartment away , so i spent the next years in a car .
it wasn' t that bad .
it was a big car , a ' 68 riviera .
it' s a miracle you survived .
do you like my paintings ?
yeah .
why don' t you tell me about this beauty right here .
that' s some girl i knew back in florida .
i used to have a huge crush on her .
now i can' t even remember her name .
this one looks a lot like the girl .
it' s the same girl .
she grew up .
and you don' t remember her name ?
no .
delicious .
it' s all coming together , as i promised .
finn frenzy !
imagine what will happen when they see your wonderful work .
your beloved per diem ... ... and an invitation to the hamilton museum benefit .

i killed a publicist for this .
it is the event .
old money , new money , big money .
everyone will be there , including you .
erica !

good looking suit !
good looking day !

are you in it ?
it' s just a little piece .
it' s nice .
you didn' t see it ?
thrall thinks that the show will get good reviews .
i don' t want to jinx it , but what does she know ?
the curator from the whitney came by .
that was exciting .
wow !
i' il say i knew you when .
listen .
what ?
walter asked me to marry him .
he wants to marry me .
really ?
yeah .
why are you telling me this ?

congratulations .
sounds wonderful .
i wish you both the best of luck .
i' ve got to go .
i' ve got to ...
finn .
i' ve got some business .
finn , wait .
why had she told me ?
she told me to wound me , or out of habit or to drive me mad .
i didn' t care if it was a clue or it was a plea or it was a tease .
no .
she told me so i would stop her , and of course i would .
fashionably late .
i have hordes of people to meet you .

by its beauty .
there you are .
i have to talk to you .

no , it' s not .
what do you mean ?
finn had a show at the washington federal a couple of years ago .
you know the washington federal ?
no .
it' s not a gallery .
it' s a bank .
savings and loan .
a bank ?
this is my first gallery show .
and you' re self taught ?
that was a gift .
finn always had it .
seven months old , his sister and i took him to the beach .
he drew in the sand .
one night he took maggie' s best perfume and drew with it in the street .
he poured it all out , and then he lit it ...
just up in flames .
the most beautiful designs you ever saw .
just ...
are you all right ?
that' s my fault .
your trousers , are they all right ?
just leave it , joe .
erica , it' s fine .

joe !

joe , listen .
this is work .

come on , i get it .
finn .
you dazzle them .
go ahead .
jeez , i' m proud of you , finn .
and i always have been .
so , just ...
finn !
go see if they know how to smoke a swordfish .
the night all my dreams came true .
like all happy endings it was a tragedy , of my own device .
for i' d succeeded .
i' d cut myself loose ... ... from joe , from the past , from the gulf , from poverty .
i had invented myself .
i had done it cruelly , but i had done it .
i was free .
i did it !
i did it !
i am a wild success !
i showed them all !
all my paintings .
you don' t have to be embarrassed by me anymore .
i' m rich !
isn' t that what you wanted ?
isn' t it great ?
are we happy now ?
don' t you understand that everything i do , i do it for you ?
anything that might be special in me is you .
estella !
finn !
what a lovely surprise !
what are you doing here ?
i own this house .
i was born here .
i haven' t been here for ages .
where' s estella ?
since i had to come up for the event , i figured , " why not stay there ?
what event ?
my opening ?
no .
estella' s wedding .
what ?
you were the catalyst .
the fool wouldn' t commit to estella , but then you came on the scene .
i don' t believe it .
storybook , isn' t it ?
why ?
at first you were practice for her , a teaching device .
throw a mouse in with the snake , teach it to hunt , swallow food whole .
i must say , you didn' t provide much of a challenge .
now , now .
you enjoyed it .
and i warned you , years ago .
i didn' t have to do that .
i told you the girl would hurt you terribly .
didn' t i ?
you chose not to listen .
well ...
i suggest you look on the bright side .
we are together , joined .
you , estella and i.
a pyramid of pain .
it' s not love , but it is a bond .
we are together .
give me your hand .
do you know what this is ?
it' s my heart .
and it' s broken .
can you feel that ?
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
what have i done ? !
the girl , the money , fame , revenge .
they had been dinsmoor' s sick obsessions .
and now they were mine .
he' s not under the car , jojo .
how are you ?
who' s this kid ?
don' t worry about him .
keep looking .
hey !
listen , listen .
can i just talk one second ?

perhaps .
but he' d lived to be my benefactor .
for good and ill .
i went to paris , worked there ... ... and received everything i thought i wanted .
i heard about estella from time to time .
she was divorced .
the years went by .
and then one day , i went home .
hi .
i' m finn .
joe !
you dog !
you dog .
why didn' t you tell us you were coming ?
who is he ?
this is jesse and clemma .
and you came in time to do the dishes .
are you hungry ?
joe told me ms. dinsmoor had died alone some years back .
her body lay there undiscovered for a month .
the mansion was due to be torn down for a housing tract .
i sat there and thought back over the things i' d done .
over my life .
and where , in that brief , violent time , it had gone .
and then , she came back again .
estella ?
finn ?
is that you ?
is that your little girl ?
oh , god .
she' s beautiful .
what are you doing here ?
i brought her to show her this place .
what' s left of it .
have you been here often ?

no , me neither .
so , you' re doing great .
i hear all about you .
i' m doing all right .
yeah .
things have been different for me .
for a long time i' d get ...
what ?
i think about you .
a lot lately .
i' m glad .
can you ever forgive me ?
don' t you know me at all ?
she did know me .
and i knew her .
i always had , from the first instant .
and the rest of it , it didn' t matter .
it was past .
it was as if it had never been .
there was just my memory of it .
