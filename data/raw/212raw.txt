fok yuen kap was a chinese kung fu master who defeated a russian strong man and a bushido master from japan .
fok became a living legend .
unfortunately , this hero was defeated by treachery and died from poisoning .
there were many rumours about the manner of his demise .
this film is based on some of the most persistant of them .
i' m too late .
i' m sure you came as fast as you could .
where is everybody ?
they' ve all gone to the funeral .
please give me an umbrella .
teacher !
teacher chen !
teacher ...
teacher' s beyond hearing .
chen !
teacher
teacher
what' s the matter with you ?
take him back .
let him rest .
have some porridge !
you haven' t eaten in two days .
teacher' s dead .
i know how you feel .
but it still hurts me to see you mourn like this .
please , eat something .
he still refused to eat ?
talk to him .
why won' t you eat ?
we all feel sad over teacher' s death .
but we have to go on living ?
i don' t believe it .
can jaundice really kill a man so fast ?
he had jaundice , but he died of pneumonia .
can that kill a man like him ?
you tell me .
how did he die ?
the doctor said ... he died of pneumonia .
i don' t believe it .
he was in pertect health .
how did he die ?
something must have happened .
calm yourself .
we' ve all been thinking about it .
lf we respect teacher' s ways , we mustn' t be rash .
we are investigating quietly .
i must find out the truth .
of course .
it' s our duty , too .
many people will come to ... pay homage tomorrow .
you must be calm .
get some rest .
fok yuen kap was a great martial arts instructor .
he was a champion of the weak .
everyone who knew him already knows that .
i , myself , knew him for 30 years .
i admire him for ... founding the cheng mo mun school .
he travelled all over the country , using up all his money and energy .
ln the end , he even sacrificed his life .
i remember what he used to say .
his purpose in founding cheng mo mun , the doorway to martial excellence , was to strengthen the mind and body .
he didn' t aim to defeat other fighters .
he was opposed to conflict among the different schools .
he hoped that all of us ... would be of one heart ... to be strong , and love the country .
i think ... we must remember his words ... and develop chinese martial arts accordingly , so that every chinese ... will be strong . to serve the community and their country , as well as the future generations .
fok yuen kap died too soon .
cheng mo mun is still so young .
he contributed so much to martial arts .
we have lost a great man .
out of respects to master fok ,
let us have 3 minutes ' silence .
please sign your name .
we' re just in time .
you' re ... ?
i' m the interpreter for the hung kiu school , mr. wu .
i' ve brought something for you .
what is it ?
our chief instructor , hiroshi suzuki , sent me .
' sick men of asia '
what do you mean by that ?
it' s very simple .
we know you' re training here .
this nameboard is a gift from our master .
are you chinese ?
yes , but i' m different from you .
calm down .
i wouldn' t dare come here if i was afraid of you .
i knew you' d all be here .
we came to challenge you .
well ?
who' il step out ?
chia chi .
stand back !
my friends here are eager for a duel .
who will satisfy them ?
you have trained hard ... but now you dare not speak out .
what' s happened to your courage ?
hold it .
you' re ... ?
i' m wu , the interpreter .
our teacher told us . to train for physical fitness , not for fighting .
our school won' t fight with you .
then you' re conceding defeat .
lf anyone can defeat me ,
i' il eat those words .
listen to my japanese friends .
they' ve made a bet .
well ?
anyone care to try ?
lf the cheng mo mun people won' t fight . how about the other schools ?
well ?
you want to ...
don' t get mad , kid .
you are all useless sick men of asia .
chen jun , control yourself .
why don' t you speak up ?
you can all attack together .
we' il be happy to oblige .
let' s go !
it' s an outrage !
lsn' t it outrageous ?
why won' t you let us fight ?
i wanted to fight too .
but teacher told us not to get in trouble .
who do you want ?
hiroshi suzuki , isn' t he your chief ?
well he ain' t here .
what is it ?
i have something to return to him .
you' ve really got some nerve .
i' m the worst of the cheng mo mun students .
i really want to try out japanese martial arts .
so you want to find out how good you are ?
well you must be tired of living !
well ?
do we fight alone or all together ?
it' il just take me to show you ...
stand aside !
surround him !
hold it !
now you listen to me .
i' il only say it once .
we are not sick men .
eat it .
this time you' re eating paper .
the next time , it' s gonna be glass .
what is it ?
are you mad ?
stop that !
a cheng mo mun student dares to cause trouble here !
what' s his name ?
master , he' s chen jun , ho' s favorite .
let me ask you this .
can we followers of bushido ... take this lying down ?
never !
japanese bushido is the world' s best .
now tell me what we have to do .
we must take revenge !
right , revenge !
okay .
smash the cheng mo mun school .
don' t come back if you fail .
yes , master .
let' s go !
what do you want ?
i want to pass no , no , no .
not allowed , i' m afraid .
and that ?
look , you' re the wrong colour , so beat it .
come here !
you were wanting to get in here ?
no , no , no .
crawl like a dog and i' il take you in .
hurry , the police are coming !
what do you want ?
you dare to attack our school ?
what' s behind this ?
why do you have to use violence like this ?
stop !
don' t insult our teacher' s memory .
stop !
right , let' s go !
that' s only a little warning .
hand over chen in three days ... or we' il have you closed down ... and you' il all be arrested , too !
brother !
come here and help !
teacher , if you had been alive we wouldn' t have been bullied like this .
he wants us to hand over chen .
lts chen' s rashness that got us into trouble .
don' t blame him .
no , don' t blame it on him .
he' s back .
what' s the matter ?
you got us all into trouble .
where have you been all day ?
did you go to hung kiu school ?
you wanted to be a hero .
look what happened to us .
why did' t you tell us what you were going to do ?
listen .
we strengthen our bodies ... to protect our beloved country ,
but not to go out fighting and making trouble .
when you went out to challenge them , why didn' t you tell us ?
many japanese came ... and beat us .
they asked us to hand you over in three days .
what shall we do ?
let him finish what he started .
how can you say that ?
what then ?
wait to be closed down ?
not only that , we' il all be arrested .
think !
we can' t give chen over to them , and we must protect our school , too .
we can' t surrender him . or he' il be killed for sure .
there' s only one way .
leave shanghai .
right .
you must leave shanghai .
never .
why not ?
i don' t want to get you into trouble .
we all understand .
you must think for yourself , too .
i' m not leaving .
you must leave .
lf they can' t find you , then even the japanese influence is powerless .
they can' t do anything without proof .
i didn' t mean what i just said .
we' re brothers .
i can' t let you die .
you' re not willing to leave .
do you think staying is such a brave thing ?
none of us is afraid of trouble .
why do you disregard good advice ?
go , we won' t blame you .
go , we won' t blame you ...
have you forgotten .
what teacher always said ?
you know the principles of our school ...
his death increases our burden .
think of the school ... if not yourself .
why sacrifice needlessly .
as your elder , i order you to go .
you' re leaving tomorrow .
buy him a train ticket for tomorrow .
it' s late , you' d better sleep .
ls everything packed ?
yes .
i came back to marry you .
but look what' s happened .
i don' t care much for ceremony .
we can return to shanghai some other day , in happier times .
my friends suffer because of me .
nobody is blaming you .
it' s the first train in the morning .
get some sleep .
i must stay with teacher tonight .
you go to sleep first .
did anyone see you ?
no .
they' re all asleep .
got it ?
yes .
mr. wu told us to get away .
lf they found out ...
fok died of this . we' d be in deep shit .
why does mr. wu want us to leave ?
he said the job' s done .
there' s no point hanging around .
what should we do now ?
you return home tomorrow .
i' il resign , and we' il go together .
so you' re japanese ?
yes ,
i came to kill fok yuen kap .
how can you say that ?
why not ?
i' m not afraid of your so called ' fist of fury ' .
you' re fok' s favorite pupil .
i must test your mettle .
feng wai sher , come out !
feng wai sher , come out !
why did you kill teacher ?
why ?
why ?
why ?
why ?
why did you kill teacher ?
teacher was killed by poison in the biscuit .
i' il go find the real murderer and take revenge .
captain !
captain !
captain !
captain !
what' s the matter ?
where' s the captain ?
two of them ... hung on a pole .
i saw it myself .
they' re out there .
what is it ?
i just bought my train ticket .
i saw two men hung on a lamppost .
lts feng and the cook , tien .
are you sure ?
yes ,
feng and the cook .
there' s absolutely no mistake .
let' s go and have a look .
what is it ?
feng and tien are dead .
it is feng !
it is ...
let' s go back and talk things through .
get transportation .
yes .
the two men' s faces were all cut up .
it seemed that they' d fought before they died .
who could it be ?
will cheng mo mun be blamed ?
no , since we don' t know who did it .
we can' t be sure what happened ,
but they still belonged to our school .
so what ?
we didn' t kill them .
this is the lnternational settlement .
i see troubles ahead .
we must find the killer .
so , who did it ?
chen did it .
chen ?
was it really him ?
he left a note for me , saying that
teacher died fro poisoning .
i wonder where he could have gone .
hiding doesn' t help .
he always acts as he pleases .
why didn' t he tell us ?
we must find him .
but shanghai is such a huge city .
where can we find him ?
he does not know shanghai that well .
organize a search !
we must find him .
we' il settle this when he returns .
who is it ?
