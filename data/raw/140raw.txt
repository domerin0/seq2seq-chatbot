the boss , teacher ... and father are one .
written and directed by yun je gyun
dusabu ilche my boss my hero
myeogdong is the bridgehead to gangnam !
though du shik has taken over myeogdong .
the area is too important for him
to be in charge !
i agree , boss !
these days , younger brothers have all graduated from high school and a lot of them went to college .
du shik didn' t even finish high school !
please reconsider , boss !
good work in myeongdong yesterday .
i owe everything to you , big brother .
you know how to be modest .
you' ve matured .
byeong hun , that son of a bitch .
what a fool .
a mere subordinate and he dares to betray the family ?
hopeless bastard ...
have another drink .
thank you , big brother .
hey , du shik !
do you have e mail ?
shit ... you take me for a fool ?
what' s your e mail address ?
1 10 21 1 seoul , jung gu , myeongdong , 844 eco villa ...
apt .
303 .
what are you doing ?
i' m setting up a cafe on the net .
cafe ?
a fucking cafe ?
you can' t make money off that shit !
big brother told us ... not to do anything that makes no money , dumbass !
hey , head !
what ?
i' m only telling the truth !
do you know what the internet is ?
you think i' m stupid ?
do you e mail ?
i fucking mail this shit everyday !
i can mail this shit 12 times a day !
12 times , moron !
whatever .
that' s what happened ?
didn' t the boss of the jongro family go to college ?
it seems people who went to college always think that they' re better !
i' ve never said that .
bull shit !
you were saying internet this , e mail that , cafe this and that , you liar !
big brother , do you know what a net cafe is ?
is it in our district ?
you' re really ignorant , big brother !
he said , " is it in our district ?
why is head always like that ?
that sort of thing is unimaginable in las vegas .
you' ve been to las vegas ?
you have no common sense , moron !
you have to have common sense , punk !
write your name .
seriously , big brother .
in chinese characters .
i' il leave myeondong open till the end of the year , just get your high school diploma .
then , if anyone has any problems with that , i' il take care of it .
do you understand ?
yeah ...
big brother .
the cops are all over the myeongdong incident .
head , you must run the business and take care of our family in the boss' s absence .
where are you going , big brother ?
big brother will be gone for a while
big brother !
you can' t go to prison !
i' il go in your place !
we should be going .
i' il go instead .
really , big brother .
thanks .
big brother ...
instead of school , how about a private learning institute ?
private institute ?
my cousin goes to one ... in noryangjin .
that' s where the best institutes are .
they have great teachers and high college acceptance rates !
really ?
but ...
do institutes give out diplomas ?
if you give them money .
oh !
the world has become a better place to live !
let' s have a round of applause for our improved educational system !
come on , come on , come on !
so , the first half should be focused on korean , math and english , and the second half on the overall general curriculum for the final spurt !
that' s it !
spurt !
spurt is important !
but ... what' s a general curriculum ?
i lowered your age .
born in 1981 , 20 years old .
20 years old ?
people often say that you look like you' re in your early twenties .
i do look young for my age .
it would be difficult to enter public schools , so i looked into private ones .
i found a private school with a good reputation and competent teachers .
really ?
sangchun high school in gangnam .
sangchun ?
you' ve been admitted by way of contribution .
contribution ?
what' s that ?
you give , and you take .
also , the important thing is ... it' s co ed .
big brother !
i' ve looked into a great place , institutes with high rates in ...
noryangjin !
it' s the best , big brother !

general curriculum !

and ...

nobody slicks their hair back in high school these days .

mr. jo ...

' what i' m telling is the truth ' .
do you understand ?

how' s a child going to learn anything if the parent is this way !
students are hit only when they deserve it !
this is a school !
misbehave ?
you think i' m the one who' s misbehaving !
what mother would like to see her child
beat up like a dog !
nonsense , nonsense !
you' re only a teacher !
don' t stand up to a parent !
i' m sorry .
you' re sorry ?
do you know who she is ?
do you know who her husband is ?
what are you staring for !
jerk ...
you want to be fired ?
you think i won' t do it ?
get out of my sight !
you' re just a pathetic teacher , cocky bastard !
what do you think you' re doing !
what on earth is this place !
is this a school ?
no matter how rotten education may have become , how can a parent come in an uproar and rage violence against a teacher !
how can teachers ever teach if we' re scared of what parents might think !
who was that ?
yang gyeong jik , up front !
right now !
you think it' s funny ?

you little brat !
what did you say about a kitchen knife ?
' do you always get off this late ? '
' get off this late ? '
' go home this late ? ' ' get off ... '
' go home ... ? '
excuse me ...
aren' t you ms. lee ?
what a coincidence ...
well ...
i' m thirsty .
sorry about earlier .
but you were wrong .
as an old proverb says that " students don' t even step on a teacher' s shadow .
have you heard of ' dusabu ilche ' ?
don' t you mean ' gunsabu ilche ' ?
it means that the boss teacher and father are one !
understand ?
they look like students but they' re drinking alcohol .
that' s unimaginable in las vegas .
you' ve been to las vegas ?
wow , a big boat !
study when you can .
you' il know what i' m saying when you get older .
fuck !
then why don' t i know ?
that was a legitimate blow .
i think that he was slightly off .
pay back my money if you have money to spend on liquor , punk !
i told you that you' d be dead if i saw you , didn' t i !
looks like they' re gonna fight .
they don' t know what they' re getting into .
you little punk , i told you to stay home , bitch !
what do you think you' re doing ?
i' m so scared !
oh my god , i' m so scared !
who are you ?
you with him ?
you his friend ?
i think it was legitimate this time .
he got him pretty good .
i told you to stay home !
stay home !
you !
come here .
yes , sir !
why ?
you wanna fight me ?
this is just like a movie .
i' m sure we' il soon be on our knees , begging you for your forgiveness .
you fight well ?
come on !
go for it .
come on !
i' m bleeding !
son of a bitch !
so you like to sucker punch , huh ?
fuck !
don' t touch me !
stay back .
and don' t touch me .
so you' ve learned how to fight , motherfucker ?
get him !
looks like he' s flying .
the technical term is ' action scene ' .
action scene ...
little punks !
students should be studying , not fighting !
are you gangsters ?
are you ?
huh ?
huh ?
are you gansters ?
want me to bring gangsters ?
wanna fight gangsters ?
one on one ?
you wanna go one on one ?
please .
what ?
please forgive us .
what do you think they' re saying ?
do you want me to go ask ?
why don' t you understand ?
you' re killing me .
what' s the big deal with changing one student' s grades ?
i' ve already told you .
if i change ji hye' s grade ,
it won' t be fair to the other hard working students !
the grades will not be changed !
look at this .
and you call yourself a homeroom teacher ?
your class' s grades are dead last .
you' re too weak .
that' s why ... students and parents ...
i' m going to leave , sir .
ms. lee !
you don' t have a clue .
this country is filled with teachers !
do you understand what am i saying ?
look into a new english teacher .
why can' t women teachers last a year ?
but ms. lee is a very competent ...
what happened with ji hye' s grade ?
he won' t do it .
bastard .
yun ju , bong pal says to come .
i mean ...
mr. jo is calling for you .
you better study harder because you' re skating on thin ice .
if you can' t get a scholarship , who are you going to resent ?
yun ju .
how many hours do you sleep these days ?
6 hours ...
sleep less !
how does a senior expect to go to college ... on 6 hours of sleep a night !
if you play and sleep as others do , how are you going to get ahead ?
do you understand me , yun ju ?
this element consists of plutonium and alloy , so an easy way to remember is play .
play .
what did i just say ?
you wanna play ?
du shik .
yeah ?
you like me , don' t you ?
if i marry you , will you send me to college ?
i' m just kidding .

mr. jo !
what ?
is it true that ... you' re resigning ?
don' t worry !
just worry about your studies .
... equals x ,
y equals x 1 +1 ...
sangchun foundation has relations with the myeongdong family .
what ?
the principal , sang chun man runs a golf course , a shopping center ... they were recently taken over by the shin gang nam' s gang .
go on .
byeong hun of the myeongdong family is working for the boss , shin .
that bastard ?
i' m sorry .
i didn' t know that .
fortunately , they don' t know of your identity , so graduating won' t be a problem .
shit ...
straighten your head !
how does the principal have a golf course , a villa and a mercedes benz ?
can he afford all of that on his salary ?
exactly .
yeong shik said he saw a secret book in his safe !
something' s fishy !
i knew it .
hey , guys !
it' s a big news !
' our school collects over several hundred dollars every month ... ' ' on the excuse of needing supplementary class , books and other things . '
' teachers are fired for refusing to follow improper rules ... '
yes .
yes .
please take care of this for me , just this once .
where has this been posted ?
not only in the department of education' s website , but the board of audit and inspection , and the president' s homepage .
damn it !
who the hell is it !
by the looks of this , it doesn' t seem like teacher ...
where' s lee yun ju ?
come here !
get up !
i said get up !
get up , bitch !
get up !
are you planning to destroy this school ?
my loving students ...
please understand how hard it was for us to collect money when we knew how difficult it was for your families to just make ends meet .
imagine the inner conflict you feel when the principal tells you to raise a student' s grade and in the end , you bury your true feeling as a teacher ... from fear of consequences .
bring back my friend , yun ju !
bring her back !
come out , sang chunman !
as teachers in the classroom , we teach knowledge but live a life ... in shame , because we did not fulfill our role as a teacher .
please have sympathy for us ...
until we meet again .
always be pure and bright , and study hard ,
who' s going to take responsibility for students who are involved in this ?
do you think those teachers are going to take responsibility ?
you can' t be serious !
are you really not coming out ?
du shik , a lot of kids won' t participate if you don' t .
aren' t you even angry ?
you disappoint me .
yun ju is your friend !
retards ...
if i were you ...
let' s just fucking go !
and you call yourself a man !
we' re wasting time , come on !
dumb bitch , why does she even like such a selfish coward ...
god damn you !
i' m never ever gonna see you again !
never !
little brat !
where in hell do you think you are ?
sangchun foundation has already influenced the politicians .
plus , the school didn' t do anything illegal .
private schools have the right of appointive power of teachers .
if we step in , things could get really bloody .
that' s why i need for you to find a way !
how can we just stand and watch ?
this is a school , not a night club !
why are you risking the chance to graduate over such trivial matters ?
you call this trivial ?
the school fired teachers because they wouldn' t take foul orders !
the school beat and expelled a girl who would do anything to go to school !
you' re just gonna sit and watch ?
tell me , moron !
you graduate in a few months .
when you do , all of myeongdong is ours !
you' re being thoughtless because of your emotions !
please think of all of your younger brothers who depend only upon you .
that' s correct , big brother .
i just did the calculations .
look at this .
i added up all the tuition and fees of every student , and it' s only half of what our night club makes .
i think what sang du is saying is on the money .
what' s on the money , moron !
stupid , dumb fuck !
be cool , big brother .
the boss shin' s power is peaking , and his syndicate is all over the country .
please don' t get yourself into this .
get out of here !
where do you think you are ?
don' t agitate the students and go home !
what kind of school is this ?
what do you think you' re doing ?
haven' t you disgraced this school enough !
are you out of your minds ?
have you no conscience ?
please get your head straight !
get them out of here !
bastard !
who the hell do you think you are ?
cocky bastard !
fuck !
what are you doing !
go home .
go home .
go home !
you bitch !
what are you staring at , bitch !
sang du .
we' re taking over sangchun high school .
du shik !
what ?
who are these guys ?
big brother !
are you okay , big brother ?
do i look okay to you ?
sang du ...
what the hell did he come here for ?
leave this school , sangchun foundation !
leave this school , a corrupt foundation !
who are these clowns ?
wow , bunch of men in black !
leave this school , sangchun foundation !
are you okay , big brother ?
move , fast !
look at him .
does he look okay ?
he' s bleeding ...
shit !
i didn' t get hit .
i was looking at the clouds , you know !
just clouds ...
motherfuckers ...
what ...
it' s broken .
du shik ?
you okay ?
watch out !
shin gang nam , let' s keep it simple and go one on one .
that was a legitimate blow .
he got him pretty good .
stand up !
ah , sorry !
does that hurt ?
it kills ...
big brother !
get off me !
don' t touch me ...
what' s that ?
that' s called ' tag ' .
tag ...
hey , come out .
yeah , you !
no weapons !
stop !
stop , asshole !
sang du !
are you okay ?
it kills ... oh ...
what did i tell you , kid ?
i told you , you' re nothing without a stick ...
your turn .
what are you doing ?
get out of my way !
this is unimaginable in las vegas .
bastard !
shit !
don' t hit my head !
stand straight !
bend your neck !
you' re all dead .
i passed the qualification examination for high school graduation .
you must' ve only studied in prison .
i owe everything to you , boss .
good work .
thank you , boss .
how is school ?
i became class president .
congratulations , boss !
you know ...
i wanna put you in charge of gangnam , but many are objecting .
it' s because of your academic background .
but i graduated high school .
most younger brothers in gangnam have been to college .
it' s a cruel reality .
you' re not possibly suggesting ... that i go to college , are you ?
write it in english .
that' s easy ...
did i tell you to write your name ?
what ?
then ...
' you' re not possibly suggesting that i go to college , are you ? '
du shik !
yes , boss ...
go to college !
