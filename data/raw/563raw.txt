get out , get out , get out !
out , you animal !
control here .
we' ve got a serious problem .
my god .
get the best doggone agent you can in there .
go !
gentlemen , a few moments ago i received word of the gravest nature .
the key agent working the brody case has been catnapped .
although he is safe , we must replace him as soon as possible .
it appears that once again we find ourselves threatened ... ... by the great cat menace .
we suspect that a rogue feline is involved in a conspiracy ... ... to destroy all we dogs have worked so hard to achieve .
therefore , in accordance with plan delta ... ... we have assembled an elite team of agents ... ... trained to replace our catnapped comrade .
at this moment , replacements are flying in from london .
one will take his place as the brodys ' pet ... ... and guard their home from cat invasion .
i need not remind you that the future of man and dog alike ... ... depends on the success of this mission .
failure is not an option .
the stakes are high .
we have everything to lose .
one hundred million dogs have placed their destiny ... ... squarely in our paws .
i' il bite your ear .
get off me !
that' s my eye you' re poking .
coming through !
pardon me .
step aside .
coming through .
out of the way .
clear the area .
not again .
what is it this time ?
i don' t think this is a good idea .
i can' t believe this guy .
when i pull this rope . . .
what is he doing ? . . . the sack will fall on the pitchfork and send me out the window . . . . . . and on the way to freedom , so step back .
what is it with you ?
me ?
what' s with you ?
i want adventure .
not wait for someone to take me to some boring house .
what' s wrong with a family that loves you ?
free food , a warm place to sleep .
and you could go to the bathroom wherever you want .
don' t you want to do something exciting ?
like be a police dog !
no ?
or a russian space dog !
or sample the great bones of europe !
come on , guys .
oh , forget it .

what stupid name did the bipeds saddle you with ?
spot ?
fifi ?

you' il get used to it .

it' s standard equipment .
ec three vid phone , research archive database , cipher charts , snausages .
hey , what' s this ?
heel !
that' s the big button .
you don' t just press the big button .
jeez .
sorry .
just try to remember your training .
let' s get started .
your new master' s a scientist .
he' s been working on a cure for dog allergies .
it' s a big deal .
if no one' s allergic to dogs , we' il have the advantage .
agent 1 364 , alka buddy .
he was catnapped about a month ago .
wasn' t on top of his game .
he had to retire .
he got a nice condo in boca .
lucky dog .
you' re here to replace him .
and to keep the cats away from the formula .
can' t let them near that .
now , come on .
all right , agent , let' s meet the team .
agent " !
whoa !
kid , look over there .
that' s peek .
peek ?
i don' t get it .
peek , show yourself .
we got a calico on the corner of center and main ....
oh , my god !
peek' s early warning .
he' s got it all .
radar , sonar , thermo imaging , odor matrixing .
he can detect a non residential cat from three blocks away .
peek , fall in .
roger that .
sam , what' s your 20 ?
one eighteenth of a klick east .
i' m going to backtrack using a delta approach in three ... . . . two . . . one .
oh , no , not again .
where am i ?
over here , sam .
request permission to pant heavily , sir .
granted .
boys , i want you to meet lou .
hey , louie .
hey , lou .
human !
lou' s taking over for buddy .
he' s in the hot seat .
fresh from the academy , he' s up to date on the latest techniques .
aren' t you , lou ?
you know this one ?
here we come .
i got you !
oh , i just missed you .
holy chihuahua .
how did this happen ?
he accidentally slipped through .
he' s still got his you know whats !
there' s no time , butch .
the puppy stays .
end of discussion .
out .
so tell me , one of you . . . . . . is the dog out of the way ?
did the puppy fall for my clever trap ?
none of you have a tale to tell ?
a little story for me , perhaps ?
you !
tell me , is the game afoot ?
yes ?
why is the game afoot ?
i mean , no .
ah , excellent .
so the puppy is dead .
now we can move on to
wait , wait .
can i change my answer ?
is the puppy alive or not ?
another dog told him it was a bomb .
another dog ?
anyway , i am sure we' il get into the basement lab just fine .
right , guys ?
guys !
oh , yeah , sure , no problem .
absolutely .
see ?
project dark cloud should go down without a hitch .
dark cloud ?
is that what i' m calling my plan ?
not that i know of .
no , you' re calling it . . . .
how about storm !
dark storm .
dark storm , yes .
yes .
like a powerful , dark storm . . . . . . i will make my presence known to the world .
. . . and make them quake in fear at the very mention of my name !
mr. tinkles !
hide !
quickly !
where are you ?
hide !
there you are , mr. tinkles .
i' ve been looking everywhere for you .
where have you been ?
mr. mason will be so pleased to see you .
i' il take you to him .
you' re a stinky kitty .
first you have to have a bath .
mr. tinkles , don' t forget to wash behind the ears !
if i' m going to be a secret agent , i should have a better name .
he' s a pro wrestler .
that name' s taken .
then " doom machine " it is .
you can call yourself squicky the space dog for all i care .
that don' t make your behind a rocket pack .
you are not an agent , but you are going to help us .
so first things first .
kid , pay attention .
dogs have always been man' s best friend .
i' m sure even you know that .
but cats , they' re another story .
peek , start with ancient egypt .
we' ve seen that 5 billion times .
okay .
never mind .
sorry .
here goes .
ancient egypt .
see these hieroglyphics ?
humans read them and say that ancient people worshiped cats .
an evil cat named shen akh akumon made them build pyramids , monuments . . . . . . and treated them like they were his litter box .
things were terrible .
this is the best part .
so the dogs , being man' s best friend , rose up .
and put them down .
with humans being back on top , we took our natural place at their side .
and the people just forgot ?
remember , they' re a very primitive species .
can' t sense earthquakes , smell fear .
heck , they can' t even take responsibility for their own farts .
gross .
guilty .
i' il get the fence .
that' s how our outfit got started .
sometimes a rogue cat gets too big for his coat and thinks he can take over .
our mission' s to keep the cats from the lab until he finishes the formula .
anything weird , call us on the collar .
yes , sir !
any questions ?
just one , sir .
shoot .
what' s ancient egypt ?
freeze , cat .
i' m an agent .
i' m so fast , i can' t see myself .
agent doom machine .
that' s right .
watch out , cat .
i couldn' t even see it .
there' s a good puppy .
hello !
don' t get scared .
don' t get scared .
look how good you' re being .
look how good .
where' s that ?
there .
i got it .
this won' t hurt a bit .
let' s see .
let' s see .
hey , that' s good .
hey , dad !
boils .
want to help me practice ?
no .
no .
i forgot your bow .
oh , your pretty bow .
when i rule the earth , you will be the first . . . . . . on my list .
keep your hair like that .
it' s slimming .
there' s room on that list for you .
no , i mean it .
we only have a few days to succeed .
although playing pet for that sick old man upstairs is key to my scheme . . . . . . i cannot stand this humiliation any longer .
am i clear ?
never mind .
the puppy won' t survive the night .
send in the ninjas .
nervous about the tryouts tomorrow ?
no .
it' s okay to be nervous .
i' m not nervous .
i stink , but i' m not nervous .
is he saying that because he needs me to reassure him ?
yes .
reassure him .
you' re the most wonderful , great , charming , good looking . . .
. . . boy in the whole wide world .
maybe your dad could help you .
no , i' m pretty sure he stinks too .
i' m going to talk to him .
time for bed .
