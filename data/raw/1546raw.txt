don' t want to keep the roaches waiting .
hey , mike .
watch your step .
yeah , yeah .
these tracks are still iive ?
williams , over here .

what happened to him ?
i don' t think he got electrocuted .
what' s going on with his eyes ?
don' t know yet .
we' il have to wait for the autopsy .
what did this guy see to ieave an expression iike that ?
any witnesses ?
not to the accident .
a guy went to grab a paper out of the newsstand .
when he came back , the victim was iike this .
according to this guy , his eyes were bleeding prior to the swan dive .
must have been into computers .
his name' s polidori .
he and another guy wrote the book .
must have tried to stop the train with it .
had to pry it out of his fingers .
now all we need is the ieading iady .
you want one ?
no , thanks .
give it up , mike .
the feds are covering that now .
it' s over .
the feds haven' t done shit .
not hearing from him doesn' t mean he' s stopped .
you' re pissed off because this doctor guy keeps sending you love ietters .
everyone has cases they can' t crack .
don' t iet it fuck with your head .
what now ?
get him out of here .
put him in a holding pen , an empty one .
and get someone to translate whatever ianguage he' s speaking .
jesus christ .
check him for a passport , an id , something in fucking english .
it says he' s a german exchange student , dieter schrader .
lives over in the village .
here' s the address .
call the health bunnies , doh .
find out if there' s some bug going around , something with bloody eyes .
they can send someone to meet me at his apartment .
sykes !
leave the doughnut shop here .
let' s go !
come on .

detective reilly .

yeah .
goddamn it .
god !

this is really fascinating .
she' s displaying possible signs of a hemorrhagic virus .
something iike ebola .
excuse me .
reilly .
" reilly , we got a problem .
sykes !
hello ?
sykes ?
what are you doing ?
call the coroner .
yeah , right .
jesus .

i got a dead girl , a woman from doh saying we have a serious problem .
i' m not going anywhere .
" i think you better get back here .
and bring the doh with you .
do you have a plastic bag ?
that' s evidence .
yeah .
excuse me .
excuse me .
that' s german .
it means " murderer .
i got that .
what' s with the 48 ?
don' t know .
barlow , what happened here ?
the guys said he was talking to himself .
that' s it .
we' il know more when we get him to the morgue .
all right , stand back .
great .
should we be in one of those suits they' re wearing ?
we' re probably already infected .
so we could all just be dying here ?
what is it with you people ?
you just iet this shit run wild ?
thanks .
serum panei is all clear .
it' s not a virus .
so we' re back at square one .
we' ve got the camcorder .
sorry about the space patrol , but we had to be sure .
no problem .
i love needles stuck in me .
it' s a hobby of mine .
so you iike working with bugs and viruses ?
someone' s got to do it .
otherwise , disease spreads out of control .
you do the same thing .
at ieast i can see what i' m dealing with .
this other shit creeps me out .
i hate germs and ....
diseases .
what about bugs ?
i pretty much hate them too .
you know you sleep with bugs ?
what ?
you sleep with bugs .
no , i don' t , actually .
yeah , you do .
everyone does .
dust mites .
they' re in your carpets , in your bed .
they iook iike iittle iobsters .
in fact , they' re distant relatives .
you' re enjoying this , aren' t you ?
i just don' t get out much .
i can see that .
i' m sorry .
i' m being inconsiderate , making you uncomfortable .
i' m so used to seeing through a iens , i forget how intimidating a camera can be .
i' m doing a iittle film at the wilton theatre , and ....
you know , i can' t say this without it sounding iike a iine , but ....
i was filming you because you happen to be the perfect ieading iady .
do you mean that ?
i can' t promise anything ... ... but come by the theater tonight ... ... i' il put you in front of the camera , see what happens .
you have to punch this button .
then you can record us .
hard to believe that' s the same guy .
wait !
i can watch this iater .
wait a second .
the guy' s iosing it .
oh , my god .
jesus .
hello ?
hello ?
hello ?
the sun' s out .
another storm coming .
shit !
i got a ticket .
i think i can take care of this for you .
really ?
so i' il see you iater ?
thanks .
terry , could you come in here ?
mr. turnbull ?
did you want something ?
no .
yeah .
what happened with the german kids ?
is it ebola ?
no .
i don' t even think it' s a virus .
what , then ?
i don' t know .
are you okay ?
yeah , i' m just tired .
let me know if you hear anything , okay ?
sure .
where did your computer go ?
broke .
i sent it in for repair .
playing on the internet too much ?
yeah .
well , i' m gonna go finish my report .
hot !
cause of death appears to be a stroke brought on by a surge of adrenaline .
no signs of violence except the bleeding .
hi , you must be terry huston .
i' m thana brinkman .
one moment .
severe rupturing to the ocular blood vessels .
i can' t account for it .
heart is completely engorged .
there' s a massive hemorrhage to the cerebrai cortex .
death was instantaneous .
end report .
so it was a stroke .
unless iab tests find something else .
there' s no known virus , bacteria or virulent protein .
excuse me .
brinkman .
we have another one .
oh , my god .
it' s eddie turnbull .
did your husband have any medicai problems ?
any condition that would contribute to his sudden death ?
other than the chain smoking and the chronic stress ?
i tried to warn him .
it never bothered him untii these iast couple of days .
he got kind of sick , started seeing things .
what kind of things ?
crazy things .
said someone was watching him .
kept talking about a iittle girl .
there was no iittle girl .
i think he worked himself to death .
always working .
always on his computer .
you know what' s odd , though ?
it was iike he was afraid of it .
mrs. turnbull , do you mind if we take this ?
now , you and i share a great responsibility ... ... to them .
they' ve come to watch but also to iearn .
we will provide a iesson ... ... that reducing relationships ... ... to anonymous , electronic impulses ... ... is a perversion .
but here , we offer intimacy .
so tell us about yourself , who you are , where you' re from .
do you have brothers and sisters ?
did you dream of being a ballerina when you grew up ?
you' re gonna kill me , aren' t you ?
of course i' m gonna kill you .
the internet offers birth , sex , commerce ... ... seduction , proselytizing , politics ... ... posturing .
death is a iogicai component .
an intimate experience made more so ... ... by knowing the victim .
so , karen ... ... tell us your hopes and dreams .
nothing .
nothing in common .
polidori had a bad childhood , some juvenile stuff .
cleaned up at tech school .
german kids seem clean .
one was arrested for weed , big surprise .
turnbull didn' t even have a traffic ticket .
i don' t know .
let' s start over .
we gotta be missing something .
they all had the same pattern of bleeding , right ?
they all had burnt computers .
maybe this guy was trying to tell us something .
we gotta get these computers checked out .
i know a forensic programmer , denise stone .
she' s worked with me before .
she might be able to help .
we need to find a common iink on these computers .
they iook pretty fried , and this one ....
you think you can do it ?
the data should still be retrievable .
unless the files have been corrupted .
i' il see what i can do .
you' re the best .
i know .
turn around , bennie .
i don' t want you watching this .
forty eight hours .
48 .
do you like to watch ?
okay , i think we get the idea .
i' m waiting for you .
denise .
come and find out .
don' t you want to play with me ?
do you want to hurt me ?
you' re lying .
how enticing the smell of cheap perfume can be .
or is that fear ?
i' d iike to say i can feei your pain ... ... but i can' t .
i can' t feei anything .
i' ve been deprived of that somehow .
i know what i should feel .
i just can' t feei it .
you can end this iesson whenever you wish .
simply ask me to kill you .
she wants to iive .
very well .
let the iesson commence .
denise !
it' s you .
hi .
what' s wrong ?
i' m fine .
i just came to give you this .
where did you get this ?
i was there .
what do you mean ?
denise , tell me .
the one thing all the victims have in common ...
... is the fear site .
that doesn' t make any sense .
he wouldn' t use the same site twice .
who ?
the doctor .
who' s the doctor ?
a skeleton in my closet .
it' s a iive cam death site .
that' s not iike turnbull .
why would he watch that ?
people love to see death .
why do you think the ratings are so high on reality disaster shows ?
maybe it' s a way to find out about death before it' s your turn .
i gotta go .
wait .
do you think you can trace who' s running the site ?
sure .
are you sure you' re okay ?
yeah , i' m fine .
fine .
denise ....
be careful .
we' il see you soon .
hey , come on .
where we going ?
i did some reading iast night .
we' re iooking for frank bryant .
over there in the back , hon .
last table .
okay , thanks .
frank bryant ?
are you mr. frank ...
... bryant ?
how can i help you , officers ?
how did you know we were cops ?
nobody ever says my name that way except cops .
we' re not here to cause you any trouble .
we read your book , the parts we could understand .
really ?
i didn' t realize my book was still being sold .
we found it on a dead man .
a guy named polidori .
polidori ?
polidori is dead ?
what can you tell us about him ?
a good guy .
a decent friend .
why would he be clutching your book as if it were the holy grail ?
i couldn' t make much sense of it myself .
that' s because it was a ioad of shit .
i needed a new car , so i wrote the book .
i was driving along one day , iooking at the telephone poles and the wires ... ... and i came up with this idea .
what would happen if you connected a whole bunch of computers together ?
you' d get one big computer .
like a supercomputer .
a neuronet .
polidori and i used to spend iong nights talking about it .
he came to believe that the web could receive energy ...
... store it , send it out .
energy .
what kind ?
here you go .
thanks , doll .
fuck if i know .
i mean , you know ....
negative energy , magnetic fields ... ... psychic energy stealing your soul .
you know ?
and ?
polidori believed he knew ... ... where that site existed .
but then again , polidori was fucked up .
and now ... ... he' s dead .
do you remember the name of the site ?
no idea .
do you think he was right ?
i never believed a word of it .
but then , i' m drunk by 8 p . m .
it' s noon .
hey , i' m ahead of the game .
thank you for your time , mr. bryant .
if we need to reach you ....
i' il be here .
i have no reason to ieave .
okay .
oh , my god .
she was the first .
jeannie richardson .
he killed her on the fear site .
he tortures his victims till they beg to die .
this is the doctor , right ?
yeah .
his name' s alistair pratt .
he was thrown out of medicai school .
nine months , he fucked with me .
i never even got close .
how come ?
after every killing , he' d change the site .
we couldn' t trace it .
what time did polidori die ?
three a . m .
turnbull was iater , about 6 , right ?
6 : 1 5 .
based on that , these victims died two days to the minute ... ... after they iogged on to the site .
the german kid was trying to tell us .
shit .
denise .
come on , denise .
you trying to get ahold of denise ?
why ?
she was supposed to drop something off .
she didn' t show
get units over there now !
what you talking about ?
i said get units over there now !
she' s not there .
she' s not answering .
keep trying .
just diai it again .
i am .
i just tried .
she' s not there .
i should never have gotten her involved .
i should have fucking warned her .
it' s not your fault .
i still don' t get one thing .
everybody died 48 hours after they went on to that site , right ?
everybody .
denise doesn' t fit the pattern .
maybe it was easier to die than face whatever is on the website .
what do you mean ?
eddie turnbull was terrified of car crashes .
it was a childhood thing .
he was manic about it .
i did some research .
did you know the german giri was terrified of drowning ?
but she didn' t drown .
she died in water .
maybe she died of her greatest fear .
i don' t know , terry .
i don' t know , i think you' re reaching .
maybe .
denise got too close .
someone killed her .
it' s as simple as that .
can you promise me one thing ?
that you won' t visit that site ?
god , denise .
do you like to watch ?
do you want to see more ?
do you want to hurt me , mike ?
jeannie !
i know who you are , and i know what you really want .
time to play .
time for us to become one .
how do i play ?
find me .
you have 48 hours .
me .
what happens if i iose ?
you die .
do you want to play ?
what are you afraid of ?
god !
jesus .
sorry , did i scare you ?
miss , your glove .
mike ?
the website .
i saw her .
who did you see ?
the dead girl .
what dead girl ?
jeannie richardson .
i saw her .
bryant was only half right .
what do you mean ?
it' s not just energy .
i don' t understand .
she' s out there , alive in the wires .
if the will is strong , it can iive in the objects around it .
you don' t go there , all right ?
promise me .
tell me you won' t go there !
don' t go there !
promise me you won' t go there !
forty eight hours .
hello , terry .
are you ready to play ?
why are you killing mike ?
guilty .
guilty of what ?
watching .
are you ready to play ?
yes .
shit !
hey , sykes .
hey .
i need to take a iook at the doctor files .
let' s go in here .
look .
the feds are covering this now .
i suppose you think you can do better ?
mike doesn' t iike people fucking with his stop !
all right !
jesus fucking christ .
knock yourself out .
jeannie richardson .
yeah , she was beautiful .
yeah , jeannie .
i checked out her addresses .
shit holes .
artist/ model , my ass .
you , though ... ... you' re a different story .
will you shut the fuck up ?
oh , my god .
joseph stalin said that the death of one person is a tragedy ... ... the death of a million : a statistic .
your death will give meaning to all us sad , iittle iives out there .
see ?
the audience is never wrong .
mrs. richardson ?
do you have a moment to talk about your daughter ?
this is jean marie on the day of her first communion .
this is the jeannie i know , not what they said .
they didn' t know her .
so beautiful .
she was a happy child despite her condition .
are you okay ?
yes , i' m fine .
condition ?
did you say , condition ?
jean marie was a hemophiliac .
without medication , she could bleed to death from just a scratch .
left her scared to death of anything sharp .
scissors or knives .
yes .
that ball ....
she always had that thing with her .
willfui child , wouldn' t give it up .
it wasn' t untii she discovered boys that she finally ieft it behind .
could you take a iook at these pictures for me and tell me ... ... if there' s any places that you recognize in them ?
it' s the old poelzig steei mill two miles down the road .
jeannie used to play there as a child .
what are you watching ?
you seem iike you were expecting me .
where is she ?
no .
mike reilly , where is he ?
excuse me ?
can i help you ?
just tell me where he is !
please calm down , or i' il have to ask you to ieave .
yeah , okay , i' m sorry .
i' m sorry , i just i really need to see him right now .
okay .
first door on your ieft .
hello ?
hello , terry .
are you ready to play ?
goddamn you , what do you want ?
" play the game .
find me .
where are you ?
time is running out .
leave me alone !
where are you ?
oh , my god .
do you like to watch ?
i am waiting for you .
jeannie ?
come and find out .
don' t you want to play ?
do you want to hurt me ?
you' re lying .
oh , my god .
i found you .
i found your body .
i did what you wanted .
i know who you are .
and i know what you really want .
time to play .
time for us to become one .
find me .
oh , my god .
what time is it ?
you shouldn' t ieave your front door open .
oh , my god .
it invites illegai entry .
mike .
terry .
what did you do ?
why ?
you just ran out , didn' t you ?
more iike a slow trot .
you gotta go back .
no , they can' t help me now .
i' m drifting in and out more and more .
okay .
i' m running out of time .
we gotta go .
where are we going ?
the morgue .
are you two okay ?
you don' t iook good .
you should see it from our side .
i just thought once we found the body , that would be an end to it .
no , there' s got to be more to this .
she had a reason .
someone performed an autopsy on this body a iong time ago .
look at the incisions .
it' s alistair .
he cut her open while she was still alive .
textbook procedure .
he cut out her viscera .
then he bagged them and sewed her up .
what' s that ?
she must have swallowed it before he killed her .
the guilty must be punished .
so she didn' t want a burial .
she wants revenge .
bingo .
two days .
two days is how iong alistair tortured jeannie before she died .
knives , mike .
she died her worst nightmare .
shit , terry , i' m iosing it .
i' m having trouble staying here .
hold on , okay ?
wait here .
come on .
electroshock , as it is sometimes called ....
electrodes are attached to the patient' s head ....
oh , my god !
mike .
i found him .
are you in , or what ?
two .
one .
it better be important .
" sykes , i need your help .
what ?
i' m winning here .
" look , i found the doctor .
so ?
call the feds .
there' s no time for that .
i need backup .
all right .
where is it ?
" a cooling tower .
poelzig steel mill .
i love watching these old tapes .
jeannie richardson .
she was my favorite .
you see , i believe death should be repulsive ... ... so we don' t grow too fond of it .
but ... ... all this could be avoided ... ... if you' re ready .
no tears .
take joy in the fact that you' ve done great good here .
you asked for death ... ... so i' m no ionger your murderer .
the time has come , karen .
drop it now !
drop the fucking knife now !
bless my soul .
reilly , so glad you could make it to the party .
you brought a date .
get away from her .
i' m not gonna fire a warning shot !
guns are so impersonai and artless .
if you want to hurt someone intimately , you have to get up close and personal .
you already tortured her .
shooting her would be doing her a favor .
you won' t shoot .
you suffer from the curse of hope .
yeah , i got hope .
i hope my first shot blows your fucking head off !
if you kill her , you' il have no one to hide behind .
i don' t want to spoii things , but if you' re ... ... expecting the cavalry to save the day , you' re gonna be disappointed .
the cavalry' s right there .
oh , my god !
fuck !
not a very nice person , mr. sykes .
appalling eating habits .
too bad this show always has the same ending .
no , not this time .
someone wants revenge .
no !
i guess the fans love a comeback .
mike .
look at me .
stay with me .
hold on .
hold on .
stay with me .
mike .
mike , iook at me .
hold on .
hold on !
look at me !
no !
attractive women iike you sell through the roof .
just iike jeannie .
alistair .
alistair !
you' re dead !
i killed you !
alistair .
alistair ... ... time to feel .
guilty .
guilty .
time to die .
oh , my god .
no , mike .
hello ?
hello ?
