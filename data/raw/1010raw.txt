i' m just going to get some flowers , dear .
it' s tulip season today and i' m so happy .
son of a bitch .
come on , sweetie .
come on , sweetie .
come on now , sweetheart .

come on , go for a ride .
no !

leg down !
leg down !
that' s it .
come on .
no !
you monkey eared son of a ...
you have pissed your last floor .
i' il bet you wish you were a real ...
you dog eared monkey .
this is new york .
if you can make it here you can make it anywhere .
verdell ?
verdell ?
where' s my good doggie ?
verdell ?
come here , sweetheart .
mr. udall ?
have you seen verdell ?
what does he look like ?
my dog .
you know ...
my dog with the adorable face .
don' t you know what it looks like ?
you were talking about your dog .
i thought it was that coloured man .
which colour was that ?
thick molasses with a broad nose .
perfect for smelling prison food .
frank !
you have got to get dressed .
frank sachs .
melvin udall .
frank shows my work , mr. udall .
i think you know that .
as long as you keep your work zipped up , around me ,
i don' t care where you shove your show .
are we done being neighbours ?
let me ...
no !
not worth it .
hope you find him .
love that dog .
you don' t love anything .
one , two , three , four , five .
one , two , three , four , five .
hot .
hot , hot , hot .
where is he ?
he had a thing with the dog .
ugly dog .
he' s adorable .
my honey .
where have you been ?
look at my boy .
i found him , mr. bishop .
we know you did .
where was my baby ?
ln the basement garbage bin eating diaper shit .
you earned your fun , john .
it just struck me as funny .
how did he get down there ?
even if he got in the elevator ...
maybe some nice neighbour shoved him down the garbage chute .
ln the dark she had confessed and he had forgiven .
this is what you live for , he said .
two heads on a pillow .
all is approval .
there is only the safety of being with each other .
how could she find such hope in the most shameful part of her ?
mr. udall !
" she was able to define love .
love was ...
mr. udall , i' d like to speak to you .
let me do this by myself .
" love was ...
are you in there ?
pansy assed stool pusher !
yes ?
this can wait .
i found verdell , mr. udall .
well ...
that' s a load off .
did you ... do something to him ?
do you realize that i work at home ?
do you like being interrupted when you' re playing in your garden ?
no , i turn the ringer off on my phone .
and put a piece of cardboard ...
i work all the time .
so never interrupt me !
not if you hear the sound of a thud from my home ,
and one week later there' s a smell from a decaying human body ,
and you have to hold a hanky to your face because of the stench .
even then , don' t come knocking .
or if it' s election night and you want to celebrate ,
because some fudge packer was elected the first queer president .
and he' s going to have you down to camp david ,
and you want someone to share the moment with .
even then , don' t knock .
not on this door .
not for any reason .
do you get me , sweetheart ?
yes .
it' s not a subtle point that you are making .
okay , then .
so , now he will think twice before messing with me .
love was ...
what was love ?
love was ...
now i' m really pissed !
don' t touch !
shut up !
you don' t intimidate me with your attitude .
i grew up in hell , homeboy .
my grandmother had more attitude .
police !
doughnut munching morons !
help me !
assault !
and you' re black !
i like simon enough to batter you unrecognizable ,
if you verbally abuse him or touch that dog again .
meantime ...
i' il think of some way that you can make it up to him .
i hate doing this !
i' m an art dealer .
have a nice day .
party !
don' t touch .
get a life .
watch it .
look at you .
you' re better .
new medication .
you know all my son' s stuff ?
i' ve got a date tonight .
i' m walking out the door , he says , " i promise not to get a cough .
lsn' t that sweet ?
a little blond angel .
i said , " you love me the way you love your remote control .
that' s great .
people that talk in metaphors ought to shampoo my crotch .
eat up !
i' ve got your money .
pay me next week .
i owe you and i told you today .
excuse me , melvin .
there you go .
pardon me .
take the money .
take a cab home and get ready .
ready is not my problem .
i' m starving .
you' re not allowed back here .
spence is more excited about it than i am .
sometimes , these kids , you just want to ...
i' ve got jews at my table .
it' s not your table .
you can sit at someone else' s station .
or you can wait your turn .
how much more have you got to eat ?
appetites aren' t as big as your noses , huh ?
that' s it !
let' s go .
he' s barred for life .
they left .
yeah , what do you know ?
bryan says , if you ever act like this again you are barred for life .
i' m going to miss the excitement .
three eggs , over easy .
sausage , bacon , fries .
fries today ?
a short stack .
coffee with cream and sweetener .
you' il die soon , with that diet .
we' re all gonna die .
you and i are , and it sounds like your son will .
if you ever mention my son again ... ... you will never be able to eat here again .
do you understand ?
give me some sign you understand , or leave now .
do you understand me , you crazy fuck ?
do you ?
yes ...
i' il get your order .
wear my earrings tonight .
it' s just so interesting .
you said it like it was nothing .
where' s the bedroom ?
this is sort of it ...
i sort of sleep in here .
don' t worry about it .
what ?
i don' t know .
grandma ...
maybe you better check .
what did you think i was going to ?
i' m sorry .
i was hearing everything ...
i put these on to give you privacy .
how was dinner ?
how was your friend ?
are you okay ?
scootch over .
where did he take you to eat ?
a nice place .
i have him ...
one more spit ?
he' s waiting .
go .
give me a hug .
carol .
carol , i have him .
she has me .
go .
close the curtains .
no !
he can' t take smoke .
magic .
god !
that' il teach you .
i don' t even notice it any more .
come here .
it' s a little bit of throw up .
" little bit of throw up " ?
what shall we do ?
shall i write down which train you take , or should we lay ...
no .
i' il take a cab .
it' s just a little too much reality for a friday night .
i promised simon i' d find him a model .
take me offthe speaker .
these are house seats .
come on .
you could use a break .
hello ?
carl ?
you there ?
okay .
i just found a model .
hey , boys !
i know this guy .
what' s going on ?
hi .
remember ?
i only need one .
you picked me up some time ago .
this is for a portrait .
portrait ?
come here .
i' il give you the address .
brad pitt .
it' s the shit .
do you read ?
who is it , baby ?
who is it , verdell ?
i' m sorry .
i told you today .
i was out in the studio and i ...
it' s out here .
you have great things .
gershwin .
great , isn' t he ?
i make a big deal about picking models , but carl is so thorough .
i bet he drove you nuts checking your rsum .
this is not a nude .
just kidding around .
so much for love .
and yet another pose .
what is your previous experience ?
i' m running out of ideas here .
give me some direction .
i just watch .
until something strikes me .
do anything you think of .
wait until i say to hold that pose , then just try to hold it .
no direction .
what i do is , i watch .
ever watch somebody who doesn' t know you' re watching them ?
an old woman sitting on a bus ?
or kids going to school ?
somebody just waiting , and you see this flash come over them .
and you know it has nothing to do with anything external .
they' re just sort of realer and more alive .
you look at someone long enough , you discover their humanity .
i know exactly what you mean .
oh , my god ...
hold it .
look out .
excuse me .
i got on the third line of dialogue .
and all of a sudden i blanked .
clippity clop . lgnores me .
so he said to me , " last chance .
last chance .
i came back in .
here she comes to ignore me again .
i messed up the same line .
but guess what ?
he cast me !
just what the world needs .
another actress .
can' t live without me ?
i' m finally going to ask .
what' s with the plastic picnicware ?
are you afraid ours isn' t clean ?
it' s a judgment call .
give yourself a pep talk .
must try other people' s clean silverware when dining out .
what' s wrong with your son ?
what do you care ?
he fights to breathe .
his asthma can shoot off the charts .
his immune system fails when there' s trouble , so an ear infection ...
ls this bothering you ?
no .
an ear infection , anything , sends him to the emergency room ,
where i get some nine year old they just made a doctor .
nice chatting .
his name ?
spencer .
spence .
it' s okay .
go on .
put on anything you want .
i might be sort of done here .
all we do is work .
let' s play !
so you' re practically finished ?
yeah .
there is one more stage .
where are you going ?
no place .
just to sneak a peek .
verdell , you want some chocolate ?
he' s not allowed .
wait !
i got to take off .
do you want to say goodbye ?
yeah .
he' s just got to go .
wait .
i' m going to look at the painting .
where are you going ?
want some water ?
what' s the matter ?
you want some water ?
simon , wait !
why are you doing this ?
no , wait ...
that painting in there ...
are you cruising him ?
excuse me ...
help me !
come on !
come on .
you call 91 1 and don' t leave your name ?
even a dumb geezer knows ...
just move on .
no one was killed .
ask him .
don' t bark at me .
i didn' t name you .
we will .
and if he can' t , we' il come back and ask you .
hey .
i come from hell .
my grandma has got more attitude than you .
go shake down a 7 1 1 for a day old wiener .
there' s a painting of one of the guys .
i' ve been praying for him .
i' m on my way to the hospital .
just watch the dog for tonight .
no , no .
i' m sorry .
thanks .
old bitch .
damn dog .
you' re taking him !
get out of the way !
even the books .
wait !
do you want to say no to me ?
i don' t want to say nothing to you .
because i' ve never felt this crazy .
i almost want you to say no .
thanks for looking after him .
hey !
where are you going ?
you don' t want to mess with me .
i can' t take a dog .
nobody' s been in here before .
hey , frank .
one , two , three , four ...
you' re dead .
we don' t have no dog food here .
you' il eat what we got .
what we eat .
don' t you do anything !
where' s the trust ?
never a break .
god !
we' re halfway through the show and we haven' t sold a painting .
no , we can' t reduce the price .
i' m in a free fall here .
we can see him .
i' il meet you in there , okay ?
thank you .
how are you doing , great one ?
i haven' t looked at myself yet .
i figured i could tell from your reaction .
that bad ?
i talked to the doctor and ...
it' s not that bad .
the doctors say you' il be your old self again .
the scars might ...
oh , shit !
jackie ...
hand me a mirror , please .
wait .
i have a smaller one .
so how are things , anyway ?
how is verdell ?
mr. udall ... taking care of him .
how could you ?
he' il hurt him .
no , i promise .
not a chance .
i own this guy .
besides , there was nobody else .
i' m always on the move and ...
trust me .
you are certain my dog is okay ?
yes , your dog is fine .
waiting gives the devil time .
oh , my !
where did i go ?
that' s your dog ?
no .
what are you doing with a dog ?
suckered in , set up .
you' re not worried he' il be taken ?
no , not until now .
sorry .
i' m going to sit here .
hey , puppy .
it' s so cute .
i wonder what breed he is .
he' s a little dog .
if bryan' s not here , you can bring him in .
how old are you ?
to guess by your eyes ... 50 .
by your eyes , i' d say you were kind .
so much for eyes .
how old are you ?
you brought it up .
i' m curious .
not that you' re ugly .
i can take the compliment .
but my knees start knocking when you turn on the charm full blast .
what' s with the dark ?
dawn patrol .
my son had a full blown attack .
and for extra fun they gave us the wrong antibiotics .
no !
it' s bacon for the dog .
last week i was playing the piano for him .
and he likes it .
so i decide i' m going to make a little joke .
it' s a beautiful day for our walk .
look at that dog .
i' ve got to give you something real good .
i' m going to show it to you .
don' t be like me .
stay as you are .
you' re perfect .
i' il get you something to eat .
i' d like to be treated like that .
let' s go home and do some writing .
he had made the girl happy .
and what a girl .
you' ve saved my life , she said .
you' d better make it up to me .
done !
yes , i hate the doggie .
62 books .
done .
we have to cut back all expenses .
he has no medical insurance ?
these are the food receipts , the household expenses .
here' s one for the dog again .
i got it .
and all the laundry .
boy , look at that .
he likes it at chez melvin .
what are you coming over here for ?
i can' t cook with a dog near me .
just sit .
we don' t want any company .
i' il read you emerson .
how' s verdell doing ?
he' s a pain in the ass .
simon' s home .
can you keep the dog until he' s had a chance to adjust ?
it' s been weeks and weeks .
a few more won' t matter .
he wants him back right away .
he' il be by tomorrow .
okay .
hungry ?
be right with you .
mr. udall .
some face they left hanging on you .
you look like ...
could you take it ... ... just a little easy , mr. udall ?
thank you .
verdell .
come here , my beautiful boy .
come here .
let' s go home and get well .
i can' t blame him for being weird .
look at yourself in the mirror .
thank you .
come on , sweetheart .
verdell , come here .
i know what you want .
where' s my boy ?
no , don' t force him .
over a dog !
over an ugly dog .
worst sidewalk in new york .
look where they put it .
help !
you' il make an appointment .
how can you diagnose someone as an obsessive compulsive disorder
and then act like i had a choice about barging in ?
you must leave .
you said you could help me .
what was that ?
a tease ?
if you take responsibility ...
you changed the room around .
two years ago .
i also grew a beard , but you' re not interested in changes in me .
i don' t have a mountain of time .
i have to get to my restaurant .
do you know how hard it was for me to come here ?
no , we' re not doing this now .
i changed just one pattern , as you always said i should .
no .
nope .
what if this is as good as it gets ?
what the heck are those for ?
no , no , no .
get carol .
i' m filling in .
she might be getting a job closer to home .
why plastic ?
what are you trying to do to me ?
what do you mean ?
look , elephant girl .
go get carol or something .
just have her do my one meal here .
i' il pay whatever you want .
do it !
bryan .
code blue .
out !
just shut up and get out .
i' il be quiet .
just let me stay here .
no problem .
go get carol .
i' m not a prick .
you are .
i' m not judging .
this day has been a disaster .
i' m not sure if i can handle this .
get out !
get out immediately or there' s going to be trouble .
see you .
it' s about time .
carol' s last name ?
connelly .
does he visit often ?
not really .
not any more .
i' m hungry .
you' ve ruined my whole day .
i haven' t eaten .
what are you doing here ?
this is not a sexist thing ...
are you totally gone ?
this is my home .
i' m trying to keep emotion aside , even though it' s important .
i have strong feelings on this .
what ?
that i wasn' t there ?
do you have any control over how creepy you get ?
yes , i do .
and to prove it ...
i have not gotten personal , and you have .
why aren' t you at work ?
are you sick ?
you don' t look sick .
just tired and bitter .
my son is sick .
what about your mother ?
how do you know about her ?
i hear you talking while i wait .
mom , i finished my juice .
one sec .
how are you doing ?
you should answer me .
sorry , melvin .
i can' t handle you teaching my son manners .
back to life .
what' s wrong ?
five one thousand , four one thousand ...
104 . 9 .
we' re going on a cab ride .
look out , you guys !
look out .
we' re okay .
we' re okay .
melvin !
wait !
melvin !
wait !
shut up , kids !
give us a lift , would you ?
cover your mouth when you cough .
brooklyn presbyterian hospital .
hospital ?
any chance you' il be back today ?
no !
stay away from me .
we can' t put this off any longer .
i feel terrible that i have to ...
could you just leave the dog for a second ?
sorry .
what are those cards ?
frank thought i should have notes .
so i would maintain focus and not terrify you .
see ?
he' s right .
i need the cards .
slmon , you' re broke
the medical bills are 61, 000 now .
and the show didn' t go well .
i spoke to your parents .
they didn' t hang up or anything .
but they' d feel strange calling you .
i can' t call them .
come here , baby .
come here .
verdell ?
what' s wrong ?
you miss the tough guy ?
well , here i am .
happy to see me , you little mop ?
how about a ride down the chute ?
i' m sorry .
i didn' t mean that .
i didn' t mean that , sweetheart .
sorry ...
i' il be able to keep my apartment and the studio , won' t i ?
oh , my god !
yes , you make us a lot of money .
but it' s more appropriate ...
i need this .
just say , " melvin , i' il try .
melvin , i' il try .
thank you .
my son just got accepted to brown .
my husband was dying .
good , nice , thrilled , exciting .
you don' t have to wait with me .
i can' t resist .
i just have so many questions i want to ask you .
you have no idea what your work means to me .
what does it mean to you ?
that somebody out there knows what it' s like to be in here .
god , this is like a nightmare .
come on .
just a couple of questions .
how do you write women so well ?
i think of a man .
and i take away reason and accountability .
mom !
ln here , mrs. connelly .
please , what ?
i' m ...
tell me !
dr. bettes .
not your name .
where is he ?
he' s in the bathroom .
what' s wrong ?
you know there are doctors that come to your house ?
i' m home .
i didn' t know you had an admirer .
oh , you met the gift .
he' s good .
i' m an expert on doctors .
okay , doctor ?
my wife is melvin udall' s publisher .
i' m to take care of this little guy because you are needed at work .
what kind of work do you do ?
i' m a waitress .
ln manhattan .
dr. bettes ?
excuse me .
i' m sorry it took so long .
i couldn' t find it , either .
could you get this to the lab ?
i want it back today .
did you say " today " ?
yes .
let' s sit down .
these are the receipts from all the prescriptions for the year .
the calendar .
this is a calendar of days .
and how he felt .
good .
how long has he had the problem ?
since forever .
six months old .
have they done blood tests ?
when he was well ?
no .
and how about skin testing ?
no .
no standard scratch test ?
no .
they said my plan didn' t cover it .
why ?
should they have ?
fucking hmo bastard pieces of shit !
i' m sorry .
that' s their technical name .
once the tests come back , is there someone we should talk to ?
me .
my home number is on the card .
his home number .
what ?
your home ...
can we get you anything else ?
no , thank you .
couple of female slaves ?
there' s still a lot of tests i need to do .
whatever i find out , i promise you ,
from now on your son is going to feel a great deal better .
doc !
that' s good .
let me know about the costs .
one way or another we' il ...
the costs are going to be considerable .
but mr. udall wants to be billed .
that' s wonderful .
thank you for everything , nora .
forgive my crankiness .
i' il call when things get back on track .
what' s wrong ?
who' s going to walk verdell ?
no !
ls he dead yet ?
no .
would there be any way you would be willing to walk his dog for him ?
absolutely .
you' re a wonderful man .
two o' clock would be a good time .
here is the key in case he' s asleep .
open his curtains for him so he can see god' s beautiful work .
and he' il know that even things like this happen for the best .
did you learn to talk like this in a " sailor , wanna hump hump " bar ?
or is this your last shot at his whisky ?
sell crazy someplace else .
we' re all stocked up here .
no !
a goofy man is behind this .
you can' t block out that man .
do you really want to go back to emergency , where they can' t help ?
this lets a crazy man into our lives .
you know how this will turn out .
this is not like a string of pearls .
you don' t send this one back .
right ?
no .
i do , i understand .
listen .
i have to go , okay ?
frlends to ask for money
bye .
bye bye .
what a day ...
maybe i' il bring him some food by .
thank you for walking him .
excuse me , i' m not feeling well .
this place smells like shit .
go away .
this cleaning lady doesn' t .. ?
please , just leave .
what happened to your friends ?
get out of here !
there' s nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you .
nellie .
your a disgrace to depression .
rot in hell , melvin .
no need to stop being a lady .
you' il be back on your knees in no time .
ls this fun for you ?
it keeps getting better and better .
i' m losing my apartment , melvin .
frank wants me to beg my parents , who haven' t called me , for help .
and i won' t .
i don' t want to paint any more .
the life i was trying for , is over .
the life i had is gone and i' m feeling sorry for myself .
it' s high times for you , isn' t it ?
the gay neighbour is terrified .
terrified !
i was trying to give you a boost .
lucky you .
you' re here for rock bottom .
you absolute horror of a human being .
the one thing i' il do for you might cheer you up .
get out .
you want to know why the dog prefers me ?
it' s not affection .
it' s a trick .
i keep bacon in my pocket .
see ?
we' il both call him .
you' il see .
it' s a trick .
come here , verdell .
come on .
come here .
just a stupid dog .
could you leave now ?
please ?
i don' t get it .
mr. udall !
carol the waitress ?
yes .
the doctors gave me your address .
i' m sorry about the hour .
if you ...
if it' s about thanking me ...
that' s not why i' m here .
though it' s nice to talk to a real doctor about spencer .
note .
put it in a note .
i have a hairdryer .
why did you do this for me ?
so you' d come back to work .
that sounds strange .
i' m worried you did this ...
are you waiting for me to say something ?
look ...
i' il be there tomorrow .
i need to clear this up now .
clear what up ?
i' m not going to sleep with you .
i will never sleep with you .
not ever !
i' m sorry , but ... ... we don' t open for the no sex oaths until 9 a . m .
i' m not kidding .
anything else ?
just ... thank you .
so you will be at work tomorrow ?
yes .
never " , she said .
i took a chance you were up .
i brought you some chinese soup .
thanks .
i' ve never been this tired in my life .
i haven' t been sleeping .
i haven' t been clear in my head or felt like myself .
i' m in trouble .
it' s not just the tiredness .
sick .
nauseous .
sleepy .
everything looks distorted and everything inside aches .
you can barely find the will to complain .
i' m glad we did this .
good talking to you .
still writing that thank you note ?
how do you spell " conscience " ?
c o n s c i e n c e.
look , i got sean to babysit so we could go out .
i don' t feel safe leaving spencer with someone .
spencer' s okay .
start finding something to do with your free time .
sean , are you hungry ?
we got pizza .
sausage , pepperoni .
you want to make this later ?
we are going out , like people do .
if you can' t feel good about this break and step out a little ,
then you ought to have mr. udall send you over a psychiatrist .
i don' t need one .
i know what' s going on here .
i must finish this letter first .
this can' t be right ?
con science ?
carol !
what ?
it' s very weird not feeling that ... ... stupid panic thing inside me .
without that , i start thinking about myself .
and what good does that ever get anybody ?
today on the bus there was this adorable couple .
and i felt myself ... ... giving them a dirty look .
i just had no idea .
everything was ...
go ahead .
moving in the wrong direction .
away from a time when i remembered what it was like to have a man ... ... to hold fucking ...
... hands with .
i felt almost really bad that dr. bettes is married .
which is probably why i make spence hug me more than he wants to .
he has to make up for his mom not getting any .
who needs these thoughts ?
so , are you frustrated ?
leave me be .
what is it you want ?
does getting me thinking about all that' s wrong have some purpose ?
really , mom , what is it you want ?
what ?
i want us to go out .
thank you .
i' il send you a thank you note .
that' s why you brought me here ?
that' s why you brought me here ?

simon has enough on his mind .
but the dog did throw up twice last night .

his stomach' s out of whack .
they need him a couple of days .

no thank you .

no thank you note .

thank you .
she' s nice .
yeah , really nice .
shouldn' t that be a good thing , saying , " no thanks required " ?
sure looks like it went over , too .
look at you .
you' re making the rounds .
simon says you brought him soup .
what ?
you think i' m a mark ...
you helped with the dog .
i' m as concerned about simon as you are .
concerned ?
he needs more than money .
he must go to baltimore to ask his parents for money tomorrow .
they have to help .
it' s the rules .
that' s great .
let them help him .
only ... ...
i got a painter coming through , so i' m out .
can you drive him ?
think white and get serious !
take my car ?
a convertible .
do you drive ?
yes .
but i' m not doing it .
getting loud .
he wants me to take his car ...
i want your problems .
somebody offers me a convertible so i can get out of this city ...
go ahead , girl .
okay .
i' il do it .
i' il take him .
get him packed .
tomorrow morning i' il take him .
i' il see you tomorrow .
let' s not drag this out .
if there' s some health foundation for people like you , let me know .
last word freak .
good luck , lady .
anything else ?
yeah .
i' m going to give my queer neighbour a lift to baltimore .
what i did for you ...
it' s working out ?
what you did changed my life .
no !
no thank you note .
well , part of what i said in this entire history of my life
is that you have done more for my mother , my son ... ... and me than anybody else ever has .
i' m just going to read you this part of it
that makes you the most generous person i ever met in my life .
and you' re going to be in our daily prayers , forever .
lovely .
i also wrote one part ...
i wrote that i was sorry .
i was talking about how i was sorry when i got mad at you
when you told my son that he ought to answer back .
i wrote that i was sorry about that .
i' m sorry for that night ... ... when i said that i was never ...
i' m sorry for every time your food was cold and you had to wait .
and i' m sorry for never spotting the human being that did this for us .
i' il just start from the beginning .
i have not been able to express my gratefulness to you .
the word grateful doesn' t begin to tell you what i feel .
that' s nice of you .
thank you .
thank you .
now i want you to do something for me .
i' m sorry .
didn' t i say " what " ?
i thought i did .
what ?
i want you to go on this trip .
no , sir .
i can' t do this without you .
he might pull the stiff one eye on me .
i need you to chaperone .
you said you liked convertibles .
now i' m on the hook .
two days .
i can' t .
my son .
bettes said he' s doing fine .
melvin , i' d rather not .
write a note .
ain' t she sweet ?
i need a hand and where is she ?
your help obligates me ?
ls there any other way to see it ?
no .
here' s a little suitcase .
shocked that it' s being used .
there' s no way to pack for this trip .
you' re still coming , aren' t you ?
yes .
melvin , exactly where are we going ?
just south of baltimore .
i know what you' re going to say .
i mean ...
i think i know .
i' m not sure , but i think so .
should i bring something dressy ?
will we be eating in restaurants that have dress codes ?
maybe ...
yes .
let' s ...
let' s .
okay .
what did you think i' d ask ?
whether crabs were in season now .
okay , then .
goodnight .
anything unusual in his diet ?
no .
everybody gets their own cage ?
put him in with that one .
lip kiss .
i love you .
i' il miss you ...
real sensitive .
bye .
call when you' re settled .
have a good time .
don' t run !
have fun , but don' t run .
i' m sorry i' m not taking you .
so am i , frank .
give me a hug .
everything' s going to be okay .
soak it up .
it' s your last chance for a hug for a few days .
hello .
thank you for being on time .
carol the waitress .
simon the fag .
holy god .
who did that to you ?
i was attacked .
i walked in on some men robbing me .
and i was hospitalized .
i almost died .
let' s do the small talk later .
i was going to do that .
where should we sit ?
there' s no place cards .
you need room .
so i' il sit in the back .
never a break .
never .
thank you .
it was very thoughtful .
you look like you' re crowded .
it' s all right .
thanks .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
i' ve got the whole trip programmed .
i just wanted to see what you' d do .
to use as lcebreaker
we' ve got good stuff here .
i like this music .
i like this music .
i' m sure they did something really off .
but something will always be off for you , unless you set it straight .
and maybe this thing happened to you to give you a chance to do that .
nonsense .
you want to know why ?
anyone interested in what melvin has to say , raise their hand .
want to know what happened with my parents ?
when i was ...
wait .
i' m going to pull over .
i always painted .
and my mom always encouraged me .
she was sort of fabulous about it .
she ...
i was too young to think there was anything wrong with it .
and she was very natural .
so she used to pose nude for me .
i always thought that my father knew about it .
this stuff is pointless .
let him finish .
do you want to hear my sad story ?
stop !
go ahead .
don' t let him stop you .
one day he walked in and found us .
and he started screaming .
my father didn' t come out for 1 1 years .
he used to hit me with a yardstick if i made a mistake on the piano .
go ahead , simon .
so he came in and he was yelling ?
please , come on .
he was ...
i was defending my mother .
i was trying to make peace in the lamest way .
i said , " she' s not naked .
it' s art .
and he started hitting me .
he beat me unconscious .
and he talked to me less and less .
he knew what i was before i did .
the morning i left for college he walked into my room .
he held out his hand .
and it was filled with money .
a big sweaty wad of money .
and he said , " i don' t want you to ever come back .
i just grabbed him and i hugged him .
and he turned and walked out .
we all have these stories .
it' s not true .
some of us have great stories .
that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad .
no one here .
but a lot of people .
that' s their story ...
good times , noodle salad .
it' s not that you had it bad ,
but that you' re that pissed that so many others had it good .
no !
i don' t think so .
not it at all , really .
not it at all ?
let' s go to the hotel .
you' il see if you can get another wad of sweaty money out of his hand .
can i ask you a personal question ?
sure .
you ever get an erection over a woman ?
wouldn' t your life be easier .. ?
you consider your life easy ?
i give you that one .
nice packing .
hey , spence .
hey , mom .
wait till you hear ...
why are you out of breath ?
mom , lscored a goal .
you did ?
yep .
he was big .
charlie .
that' s great .
oh my god !
we' re playing again .
got to go .
wait ...
he scored a goal .
i don' t believe it .
you would have died .
my son was outside playing soccer .
take me out dancing .
dancing ?
i can' t .
i' m exhausted .
oh , come on .
no .
all right .
are you sad or something ?
no .
i' m nervous .
it would be very rough , carol , if you weren' t along .
i' m happy .
and you' re my date .
let' s get dressed .
i' m going to jump in the shower .
i' il be right with you .
all set ?
do you sell hard shell crabs ?
yes .
do they sell hard shells ?
yes .
do they sell hard shells ?
yes .
good evening .
you have hard shells , right ?
stop asking .
you can answer .
yes , we do .
i can give you a tie and jacket .
what ?
they require a tie and jacket .
no .
i' m not putting that on .
and i won' t let you inject me with plague .
it' s a nice place .
you dry clean these all the time , don' t you ?
i don' t think so .
you just wait here .
good evening .
i need a coat and tie .
come on in .
no ?
that one .
and this tie .
excuse me .
she' s here .
we saved a table for you .
should i get her for you ?
no .
i' il just watch .
ma' am ...
you look so se ...
you look great .
you look great .
you want to dance ?
i' ve been thinking about that since you brought it up before .
no .
i don' t get this place .
they make me buy a new outfit and let you in in a housedress .
what ?
wait .
where are you going ?
why ?
i didn' t mean it that way .
sit down .
give me the dirty look .
pay me a compliment , melvin .
i need one .
quick .
what you just said hurt my feelings .
the minute someone gets that they need you they threaten to walk out .
a compliment is something nice about somebody else .
now or never .
and mean it .
can we order first ?
two hard shell crab dinners ...
pitcher of cold beer .
baked or fries ?
fries .
fries .
one baked , one fried .
i' il tell your waiter .
i' ve got a great compliment for you .
and it' s true .
i' m afraid it' s something awful .
don' t be pessimistic .
okay .
here i go .
clearly a mistake .
i' ve got this ... ailment .
my doctor , a shrink i used to go to ,
says that in 50 or 60 percent of the cases a pill really helps .
i hate pills .
very dangerous thing .
i' m using the word " hate " here about pills .
my compliment is , the night you came over and told me you would never ...
all right , you know what you said .
my compliment to you is ,
the next morning i started taking the pills .
how is that a compliment for me ?
you make me want to be a better man .
that' s maybe the best compliment of my life .
maybe i overshot a bit to keep you from walking out .
how' s it going with those pills ?
good , i hope , i hope , i hope .
it' s little by little .
it' s exhausting talking like this .
exhausting .
do you ever let a romantic moment make you do something stupid ?
never .
here' s the trouble with never .
you don' t owe me that .
that wasn' t payment .
when i first saw you i thought you were handsome .
then , of course , you spoke .
so now that your ... soft underbelly is all exposed ...
tell me , why did you bring me here ?
well , i ...
that' s a personal question .
tell me , even if you' re scared .
scared ?
tell me why you wanted me here .
if you ask me , i' il say yes .
i ...
there' s a lot of reasons .
if you had sex with simon ...
what ?
that' s just one idea .
that' s why you brought me ?
like i' m a what .. ?
and i owe you what ?
i don' t know why i brought you .
it was just one thought .
it came out first .
you kiss him ... me ...
you two seemed to hit it off .
wait .
i didn' t mean ...
forget what i said about simon .
i' il never forget it .
a mistake .
it was a mistake .
hello , this is fred bishop .
we' re unable to take yourcall .
leave a message .
say goodbye ... and thank you .
it' s simon .
i' m in town .
you' ve never been out later than ten o' clock .
pick up the phone .
really .
i' m going to try you in the morning .
i need to see you .
or at least get you to answer the phone .
how are you ?
ls this going to be your room ?
our room .
i don' t want to see him .
what happened ?
don' t ask .
can you not be so violent ?
i don' t think so .
i' m taking a big bath .
are you okay ?
don' t ask .
i' m tired of my complaints .
what are you thinking about ?
how to die , mostly .
can you believe , in our little mix you' re the good roommate ?
goodnight .
hold it .
i have to draw you .
i have to draw you .
no .
i' m more shy than people think .
i have to .
i haven' t sketched in weeks .
stop staring .
do a vase .
but you' re beautiful , carol .
your skin , your long neck .
the back .
the line of you .
you' re why cavemen chiselled on walls .
cut me a break .
the next thing i know she' s sitting next to me .
it' s not right to go into details .
i got nervous .
i said the wrong thing .
where , if i hadn' t ,
i could be in bed now with a woman who ...
if you make her laugh , you got a life .
lnstead , i' m here with you .
no offence , but a moron pushing the last legal drug .
jameson , soda back .
i don' t care how you put this .
we' re being naughty here , pal .
no , this is ...
this is great .
this is so great .
my hand won' t even keep up .
hold it .
i' m just turning .
but hold that .
my hand' s not even bothering me .
i can' t get the angle with this cast .
careful .
prlvacy
i' m coming in .
it' s late .
did you have sex with her ?
don' t you want your shampoos ?
sorry .
i didn' t know she was still here ...
did you have sex with her ?
to hell with sex .
it was better than sex .
we held each other .
what i need , he gave me great .
i' il get dressed in a hurry .
i just love her .
how are you doing ?
mom , hi .
hello , simon .
you were right we were home .
do you have to whisper ?
i' m nota screamer .
it was lucky you didn' t answer .
yourfatheris not feeling well .
i can' t hear you .
hold on .
what are you going to do ?
i get why you' re angry with me ...
he' s talking to his parents .
listen to me .
truly no grudges .
it was odd that you didn' t come and see me when you heard i was hurt .
we almost did .
i don' t want to talk about it .
the important thing is that your son is happy .
i' m working again .
good .
aboutmoney ...
no .
i' il drop you a line .
it' s up to you to make the next move .
he' s going to want to stay .
and they' il take a ride to the lake .
bye bye .
goodbye , dear .
we' il probably have a five hour drive .
it' il give us a chance to ...
i' m coming .
what about your parents ?
no .
i' il take care of myself .
what are you talking about ?
you' ve got real problems .
i know .
i' m a little bit nervous .
suddenly everything seems so easy .
carol , a load has been lifted .
one night wih me .
you think you' re kidding .
no choice .
i' ve got a gift for you .
let me see ...
gorgeous .
do it .
and get the dog picked up .
i can' t believe he let it stay there .
goodbye .
your luck' s running .
they sub let your place .
you' re homeless .
frank' s got a line on a new place .
where ?
does it matter ?
no , it doesn' t .
i' m fine .
like the hat ?
i' m sorry .
for emergency use only
i don' t want to hear that music .
you said you liked it .
this one has a meaning .
i don' t want to hear it .
here' s the keys to my apartment .
go up there and wait and i' il take carol home .
i' il take a bus .
no , i' il take you .
can you come here ?
i don' t care what you did for me .
what' s wrong ?
i don' t want to know you any more .
all you do is make me feel bad .
you have my number .
let him take you home .
don' t want to .
i love you .
i love you too .
don' t say anything .
i' ve got to get a hold of frank and see where i' m hanging my hat .
i think you' re going to have to camp it here .
there' s verdell !
mommy and daddy are home .
sorry .
you' re fun to mess with .
they rented your place furnished .
jackie said she' d bring your things .
they were going to set you up in here .
it' s an extra room .
it' s got good light .
i' m coming .
it' s nice .
looks good .
they' ve even got your music , paintings , paints .
i have to say they did a good job .
it' s going to be okay .
cosy , huh ?
thank you , melvin .
you overwhelm me .
i love you .
i' d be the luckiest guy alive if that did it for me .
make yourself at home .
anything else in the bag ?
but i was playing soccer while you were away .
i love my cookbook .
it' s got wonderful recipes .
it says something with a shark .
shark with a bite .
would you like that , spencer ?
and some cookies here called wasps ' nests .
where is my big hairy boy ?
where is he ?
where is my beautiful boy ?
sweetheart !
oh , you' re in bed .
no , no .
i just didn' t think verdell should get too comfortable sleeping here .
the dog' s already comfortable .
ls this okay ?
hello ...
hi , it' s me .
he took me in .
it' s carol for you .
jackie brought it all over ...
just take the dog .
take the dog .
come on .
move fast .
don' t limp .
good luck .
howare you doing ?
not so hot .
why ?
what' s wrong ?
was i sensible or hard on you ?
maybe both .
are you being cute or crazy now ?
cute .
you don' t have to answer .
just listen to me .
it' s really something that you' re looking after simon .
and what i said on the street ...
that was a bad thing to say .
it made me sick to my stomach .
it was a bad thing to say .
and i' d be lying if i didn' t say i enjoy your company .
but you do bother me .
and i know it' s better for me ... ... to not have contact with you because you' re not ready .
you' re an old guy to not be ready .
and i' m too old to ignore that .
but there were extraordinary kindnesses that did take place .
anyway .
thanks for the trip .
goodnight .
okay if i say something now ?
go ahead .
i should have danced with you .
goodnight .
are you going to talk to me ?
i' m coming .
what did she say ?
that i' m a great guy .
and she doesn' t want contact with me .
i' m dying here .
because ... you love her .
no .
and you people are supposed to be sensitive ?
then you tell me why .
you' re the one who' s " dying here " .
let me sleep on it .
oh , come on .
i' il figure it out .
please ...
i' m stuck .
i can' t get back to my old life .
she' s evicted me from my life .
did you really like it that much ?
it' s better than this .
if you' re going to give me hope , you' ve got to do better .
if you can' t be mildly interesting , then shut up .
i' m drowning here !
and you' re describing the water .
picking on me won' t help .
if that' s true , i' m really in trouble .
do you know where you' re lucky ?
you know who you want .
i would take your seat any day .
do something .
go over there .
tonight .
it' s not always good to let things calm down .
you can do this , melvin .
tell her how you feel .
i' m charged .
yes , you are .
she might kill me if i go there .
then stay .
i' il read you a story .
the best thing going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself .
go over there .
do this .
catch her off guard .
thanks a lot .
here i go .
what' s wrong ?
i forgot to lock the door .
what do you want ?
i' m sorry i woke you up .
i wasn' t asleep .
what a break .
ls it a secret what you' re doing here ?
i had to see you .
because ?
it relaxes me .
i' d feel better sitting outside your apartment on the curb
than any other place i can think of or imagine .
that' s overstating .
i' d rather be sitting inside so i don' t get my feet in the gutter .
stop .
why can' t i just have a normal boyfriend ?
why ?
a regular boyfriend who doesn' t go nuts on me .
everybody wants that .
it doesn' t exist .
i' m sorry .
i didn' t mean to interrupt .
boyfriend ...
come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you .
maybe we could live without the wisecracks ?
maybe we could .
it feels a little confined here .
let' s take a walk .
it' s four in the morning .
a walk sounds a little screwy to me .
if you don' t mind .
well , if you need an excuse ...
there' s a bakery on the corner that' il be open soon .
that way we' re not screwy , but two people that like warm rolls .
what are you doing ?
i want you to hear that song .
and darling i' m neverlonely wheneveryou' re in sight ...
thank you .
i was ...
i' m sorry .
whatever this is won' t work .
i' m ...
what ?
i' m feeling better .
it may seem that way now , but you don' t know me all that well .
i' m not the answer for you .
i' ve got a compliment for you .
you know what ?
let me talk .
i might be the only person on the earth
that knows you' re the greatest woman on earth .
i might be the only one who knows how amazing you are .
and how you are with spencer .
spence .
and in every single thought you have .
how you almost always mean something that' s about being straight or good .
most people miss that about you .
i wonder how they can watch you bring their food and clear tables
and never get that they just met the greatest woman alive .
and the fact that i get it makes me feel good ... ... about me .
ls that something that it' s bad for you to be around ?
no .
i' m going to grab you ?
i didn' t mean for that to be a question .
i' m going to grab you .
i know i can do better than that .
better .
definitely better .
see ?
want something ?
warm rolls .
excuse us .
