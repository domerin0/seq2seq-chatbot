so we' re planning our next vacation .
i want australia , she wants ltaly .
i like snorkelling .
she likes garlic .
all of a sudden , out of nowhere , she says to me : do i need her ?
jesus , benny .
what kind of a question is that ?
need ?
what does it really mean to need somebody ?
benny , fuel line .
waldo , could you answer that phone ?
hello .
i need a cheque , benny .
cod .
in a minute .
meet me in the office .
all right .
whoa !
put that out !
i got a fuel line broke .
hey , benny .
joon' s on the phone again .
i' il call back .
find out what she wants .
it' s an emergency .
she says you' re runnin ' low on peanut butter super chunks .
an emergency ...
the issue is jelly .
you only like two kinds .
you either like grape or boysenberry .
which is it ?
all right .
yeah , yeah , yeah , peanut butter .
i know .
super crunch .
i' il see you at six , ok ?
bye .
thanks for waitin ' , ma' am .
i' m afraid the best we can do for you is gonna be ...
it' s gonna be $750 .
if you check around , you' il see that that is a really good deal .
yeah ?
that is a really very good deal , ma' am .
a little too good .
let' s do it .
come here .
come here .
you' re not doing your job !
what is your job , anyway ?
to clean this house , but not any more !
get out of my sight !
you wouldn' t dare , joon !
what is going on here ?
joon ?
mrs smail , please , let me explain .
beware , the winds of reason shall blow stern .
what ?
i' m done , mr pearl .
i' m done !
the mule' s turned to glue !
she wanders off unescorted .
she has sudden outbursts .
she' s simply unmanageable .
mrs smail , wait .
please , let me talk to her .
i can talk to her .
you can' t quit on such short notice .
i' m sorry , sir .
in lreland , we have a sayin ' .
when a boat runs ashore , the sea has spoken .
come on !
we can' t play three handed poker .
she' s gonna be alone every day .
i' m not leavin ' her alone at night , too .
so bring her .
shejust paints and reads .
yeah , and lights things on fire .
that happened once .
i got a fire extinguisher .
just bring her .
get your ass over here .
don' t forget the louis prima record .
remember , always play for keeps .
all right , all right , all right .
yeah , i' il be there .
ok .
joon , dinner !
spaghetti and salad ?
in that order ?
what happened between you and mrs smail ?
she was given to fits of semiprecious metaphors .
she' s a housekeeper , not an english professor .
she moves things .
she said you wandered off .
did you leave the house alone ?
define " alone " .
you know full well what i' m talkin ' about .
i can' t be worried about you knocking another housekeeper into retirement .
first , it was mrs larkspur .
a woman deeply and hygienically disturbed .
her hair smelled .
but then it was mrs piltz .
piltz ?
the answer' s in the question .
let' s face it , benjamin .
hiring housekeepers is not your forte .
well , until i do find another housekeeper , you are gonna stick close to the house . understand ?
now have some salad .
by the way , i want you to come with me to my poker game .
benny ...
come on .
you' il have a good time .
web belt and buckle .
classical greek martini shaker .
six turkey feather darts .
i' il see you with a deanna durbin album .
come on .
and i' il raise you with a stethoscope .
does it have little plastic earpieces ?
what do you care ?
you never win , mike .
i don' t want ' em stabbin ' my eardrums .
steering wheel knob .
salad shooter .
' 56 plymouth tyre iron .
fold o .
you must have a good hand , huh ?
no , i' m bluffin ' .
really ?
come on .
you gotta play to find out .
ok .
1 50 feet of coaxial cable .
show ' em .
full house .
jacks over fours .
oh , shit .
i thought he was bluffin ' .
will someone get some air to his brain ?
he was bluffing about bluffing .
you' re a real pal , benny .
i got a solution to your housekeeper problem .
you can have my roommate .
that' s a terrific offer , benjamin .
save you from the chore of smail shopping .
those places are such drudgery .
montgomery and smails , smails and roebuck , smails r us ...
joon .
when did you get a roommate ?
since last week .
my cousin pounded into town and life' s gone from heaven to hell in seven days .
just like the good lord intended .
26 years old , he can' t even read .
spends all day polishing my plastic forks .
when you say he can' t read , what do you mean ?
like words ?
yeah .
and he keeps me up all night watchin ' stupid old movies .
my work' s starting to suffer .
you install cable tv .
joon , will you please glue your sequins ?
have we an internal sequin issue to deal with , benjamin ?
all right , can we make this the last hand ?
come on , come on .
play cards .
two tickets , tomorrow night' s baseball game .
one pocket fisherman .
fold .
do you ever stay in ?
snorkel mask .
she knows how to rattle the day help .
i think we need to find someone more understanding than mrs smail .
tell me , how are you two getting along ? us ?
fine .
normal .
you know , fine .
why ?
i' il level with you .
i think it' s time you gave some serious consideration to a group home .
she already has a home .
benny , she' d be with her peers .
she hates her peers .
she' s already quit the two day centres to prove it .
look , all we need right now is a new housekeeper .
well , i know of no one else .
you' ve been up and down the list .
you might want to consider that there are some people more capable of handling these episodes than you .
i think that you two living together may not be the best thing any more .
i' m her brother , and i' m her only family .
and we' ve done just fine , the two of us , for 1 2 years .
yes , but her stress level is always a factor in her display of symptoms .
her agitation should be kept to a minimum .
everybody gets agitated .
sometimes it' s the only option .
benny , don' t get me wrong .
i' m impressed how you' ve managed this long .
but a group home would let her develop other relationships .
we don' t know this , but what if she were capable of a job ?
they' d encourage her in that direction .
these are very nice places nurturing , supportive .
i' m not farming her out .
i have every right to be outside , officer .
i have every right .
yes , ma' am .
may i see some id , please ?
waldo , did you start that brake job yet ?
joon called .
you' ve run out of tapioca .
she what ?
oh , and the police will corroborate .
holy shit .
listen , jack , you wanna go to the baseball game tonight ?
hey , thanks , benny .
box seats .
hello ?
joon ?
time for your medicine , joon .
good night , steve .
oh , hello .
how' s it goin ' ?
i appreciate the deal on the engine .
no problem .
is it runnin ' all right ?
yeah , it' s running great .
good .
so ... can i ...
can i make it up to you with some dinner ?
some dinner ?
are you serious ?
yeah .
dinner with you .
you know what ?
i can' t .
i mean , i' d like to ...
it' s ok .
ok .
stupid .
stupid .
18 1 5 .
17 16 .
18 1 5 !
it caught the corner .
it was a foot off the table .
it was not .
juniper ...
benjamin ...
don' t underestimate the mentally ill .
we know how to count .
ok , fine .
17 16 .
you can' t give me what was mine .
you' re trying to cheat .
i' m not .
you' re cheating .
joon , you' re the one who' s cheating .
you' re all trying to cheat me .
you' re trying to cheat .
yeah .
i spoke to some of the guys on the staff , benny .
nobody wants to be a housekeeper .
i will .
i' il keep tryin ' .
but i gotta tell you honestly , i don' t think so .
yeah .
ok .
thanks .
bye .
ok , stevie .
i mean , i can' t even keep a goldfish alive .
what chance do i have with joon ?
if somethin ' bad happened to her , i' d ...
i' d never ever be able to forgive myself .
a group home is the right thing for her , benny .
yeah .
this is definitely for her own good .
hey , it' s for both your own good .
how much longer can you do this to yourself ?
your life is literally passing you by .
you' re right .
you' re right .
what am i doing with myself ?
i spend my life workin ' on cars and takin ' care of my sister .
i can' t have a relationship without havin ' to worry about how joon is gonna fit in .
once she gets settled in , you could actually take a vacation .
travel a little .
i can hold down the fort .
travel ?
travel ?
benny , there' s a whole world out there .
i mean , picture yourself on the open road .
wind in the hair in the ei camino .
highway stretchin ' out ...
what' s that , up ahead ?
a lovely motorist , stranded .
carburettor trouble .
better investigate .
yeah , right .
i' m gonna be stoppin ' every 1 5 minutes to call joon to see how she' s doin ' .
ok , let' s see .
black sabbath , over there .
is that a flashlight ?
it' s a brush kind of a thing .
here' s a hat .
where' s the batteries ?
you didn' t win batteries .
those are mine .
ok .
hey , guys , hurry it up !
or we' il start without you .
i' ve been known to play a little cards .
box of 30 aught 6 cartridges .
medium sized , green haired troll .
soap on a rope , slightly used .
cards ?
three .
cards ?
two .
and the dealer takes ... three .
pass .

blue grout .
i fold .

lava lamp .
paint the exterior of my house .
hey , come on , slow down .
this is supposed to be reasonable stakes .
that' s a see and a raise .

you take my cousin off my hands .
wait , wait , wait .
just stop .
benny' s gonna strangle you guys .
chill out , thomas .
joon , we gotta go .
flush !

yes .
yes !
benny , tonight' s your lucky night .
mike warned her it was for keeps .
what ?
what was for keeps ?
i lost .
what' s in the pot ?
a cousin .
rules are rules .
without ' em there' s no order in the universe .
don' t you give me that crap .
you took advantage .
of your sick sister .
a heart flush is a perfectly respectable hand .
not respectable enough .
hey , shut up , mike .
i am not takin ' this guy home .
you have to !
remember the bet i lost last year ?
when i had to re plate your socket set , i didn' t back out .
you can' t bet a human being !
oh , well , if you' re gonna be a baby about it ...
all right , mike .
you wanna play like that ?
i' il take him .
i may not be responsible for what i' m gonna do to him , but i' il take him .
oh , man .
what are you doin ' , you jerk ?
somethin ' wrong with your car .
what did you do with my hubcaps ?
i don' t know .

mentally ill .

yeah .
but , i mean , don' t worry about it .
but just let her go about her routine .
her routine is everything to her .
oh , and don' t hang around her room while she' s painting .
she hates that .
no .
if she runs hot and cold on you , just ignore it .
that' s just the way it works .
listen , if she starts talkin ' to herself , don' t worry about it , but don' t answer .
ok .
she sometimes hears voices in her head .
that comes with the territory , too .
and ... just make sure that nothin ' and , you know , i mean nothin ' happens to her .
ok .
ok .
all right .
having a boo radley moment , are we ?

what ?
what did he ...
what did he do ?
he cleaned the house .
and you kicked him out for that ?
maybe i should invite him back in .
yeah .
before someone sticks a stamp on his head and mails him to guam .
some cultures ... are defined by their relationship to cheese .
is that a fact ?
he can really cook , can' t he ?
yeah .
although , for grilled cheese , i might' ve used the wool setting .
that' s what i told him .
really ?
what did he use ?
rayon .
silk would' ve been too soggy .
cotton would' ve ...
would' ve burned it .
right .
fortunately he consulted me before giving it steam .
i was against it .
i wish he could be my new smail .

good night .
good night .
you need some help ?
dear mom , i' ve departed mike' s with love and gratitude and am now living with benny and joon pearl , two devoted new friends .
benny' s predisposition to hypertense lrish monologists notwithstanding , he has given me a job as a domestic engineer and seems pleased with me so far .
love , sam .
wow .
i didn' t know i could talk like that .
tapioca ?
oh .
yeah .
ok .
thank you , ruthie .
you' re welcome , sam .
let me know if you need anything , ok ?
you don' t like raisins ?
not really .
why ?
they used to be ... fat and juicy .
and now they' re twisted .
they had their lives stolen .
they taste sweet , but really they' re just humiliated grapes .
i can' t say i' m a big supporter of the raisin council .
did you see those raisins on tv ?
the ones that sing and dance and stuff ?
they scare me .
yeah .
me , too .
it' s sick .
they make them sing and dance so people will eat them .
it' s a shame about raisins .
cannibals .
yeah .
do you like avocados ?
they' re a fruit , you know .
ruthie ?
do you got any avocados ?
joon ?
you' re very pretty when you' re off work , ruthie .

how long have you known him ?
sam ? uh ... 72 hours .
be serious .
i am serious .
really ?
i' m always serious .
i' m too serious .
d' you ever get to the point in your life where nothin ' makes any sense ?

let' s just forget it .
there' il be other boys , other midnight swims , other prom dresses .
