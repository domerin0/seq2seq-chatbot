maycomb was a tired , old town , even in 1932 when i first knew it .
somehow it was hotter then .
men' s stiff collars wilted by 9 : 00 in the morning .
ladies bathed before noon , after their 3 : 00 naps ... and by nightfall were like soft tea cakes ... with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum .
the day was 24 hours long , but it seemed longer .
there was no hurry , for there was nowhere to go ... and nothing to buy ; no money to buy it with .
although maycomb county had recently been told ... that it had nothing to fear but fear itself .
that summer i was six years old .
good morning , mr. cunningham .
good morning , miss .
my daddy' s getting dressed .
would you like me to call him for you ?
i don' t care to bother .
why , it' s no bother , mr. cunningham .
he' il be happy to see you .
atticus !
atticus ?
it' s mr. cunningham .
good morning , walter .
good morning , mr. finch .
i didn' t want to bother you none .
i brung you these here hickory nuts as part of my entailment .
well , i thank you .
the collards we had last week were delicious .
well , ' morning .
' morning .
scout , i think maybe , uh , next time mr. cunningham comes , you better not call me .
i thought you' d want to thank him .
oh , i do .
i think it embarrasses him to be thanked .
why does he bring you all this stuff ?
he' s paying me for some legal work i did for him .
why does he pay you like this ?
that' s the only way he can .
he has no money .
is he poor ?
yes .
are we poor ?
we are , indeed .
are we as poor as the cunninghams ?
no , not exactly .
cunninghams are country folks , farmers .
the crash hit them the hardest .
scout , call your brother .
atticus ?
jem' s up in the tree .
he says he won' t come down until you agree to play football for the methodists .
jem ?
son , why don' t you come down out of there now and have your breakfast .
calpurnia has a good one .
hot biscuits .
not ' til you agree to play football for the methodists .
oh , son , i can' t do that .
i' m too old to get out there .
after all , i' m the only father you have .
wouldn' t want me to get my head knocked off , would you ?
i ain' t comin ' down .
suit yourself .
good morning .
good morning , miss maudie .
what' s going on over there ?
i' m having a terrible time , miss maudie .
jem' s stayin ' up in the tree until atticus agrees to play football for the methodists .
atticus says he' s too old .
every time i' m wantin ' to do something , he' s too old .
he' s too old for anything !
he can do plenty of things .
you be good , children .
mind cal .
' morning , maudie .
' morning , atticus .
he won' t let me have a gun , and he' il only play touch football with me , never tackle .
he can make somebody' s will so airtight , you can' t break it .
you count your blessings and stop complaining , both of you .
thank your stars he has the sense to act his age .
jem , he is pretty old .
i can' t help that .
hey .
hey , yourself .
i' m charles baker harris .
i can read .
you got anything needs readin ' , i can do it .
how old are you ?
four and a half ?
goin ' on seven .
no wonder then .
scout' s been readin ' since she was born , and she don' t start school ' til next month .
you look right puny for goin ' on seven .
i' m little , but i' m old .
folks call me dill .
i' m from meridian , mississippi .
i' m spending two weeks next door with my aunt stephanie .
my mama worked for a photographer in meridian .
she entered my picture in the " beautiful child " contest and won five dollars on me .
she give the money to me , and i went to the picture show 20 times with it .
our mama' s dead , but we got a daddy .
where' s your daddy ?
i haven' t got one .
is he dead ?
no .
well , if he' s not dead , you' ve got one , haven' t you ?
hush , scout .
what did i do ?
what did i do ?
dill , this is calpurnia .
pleased to know you , dill .
pleased to know you .
my daddy owns the l& n railroad .
he' s gonna let me run the engine all the way to new orleans .
is that so ?
he says i can invite anybody ...
shh .
there goes the meanest man that ever took a breath of life .
why is he the meanest man ?
well , for one thing , he has a boy named boo ... that he keeps chained to a bed in the house over yonder .
come on .
see ?
he lives over there .
boo only comes out at night ... when you' re asleep and it' s pitch dark .
when you wake up at night , you can hear him .
once i heard him scratching on our screen door , but he was gone by the time atticus got there .
wonder what he does in there .
wonder what he looks like .
well ... judging from his tracks , he' s about six and a half feet tall .
he eats raw squirrels and all the cats he can catch .
there' s a long , jagged scar that runs across his face .
his teeth are yellow and rotten .
his eyes are popped , and he drools most of the time .
oh , i don' t believe you .
dill , what are you doing here ?
my lord , aunt stephanie !
you almost gave me a heart attack !
dill , i don' t want you playing around that house over there .
a maniac lives there , and he' s dangerous .
see ?
i was trying to warn him about boo , but he wouldn' t believe me .
you better believe him , mr. dill harris .
tell him about the time boo tried to kill his papa .
i was standing in my yard when his mama come out yelling , " he' s killing us all !
turned out that boo was sitting in the living room cutting up the paper for his scrapbook , and when his daddy come by , he reached over with his scissors , stabbed him in his leg , pulled them out and went right on cutting the paper .
they wanted to send him to an asylum , but his daddy said , " no radley is going to any asylum .
so they locked him up in the basement of the courthouse ...
' til he nearly died of the damp ... and his daddy brought him back home .
there he is to this day , sitting over there with his scissors .
lord knows what he' s doing or thinking .
six , seven , eight ,
six , seven , eight ,
nine , ten !
come on , scout !
it' s 5 : 00 !
where you going ?
time to meet atticus .
why do you call your daddy atticus ?
' cause jem does .
why does he ?
i don' t know .
he just started to ever since he began talking .
wait .
stop .
miss dubose is on her porch .
listen , no matter what she says to you , don' t answer her back .
there' s a confederate pistol in her lap under her shawl , and she' il kill you quick as look at you .
come on .
hey , miss dubose .
don' t you say " hey " to me , you ugly girl !
you say , " good afternoon , miss dubose .

good afternoon , miss dubose .
my , you look like a picture this afternoon .
he don' t say a picture of what .
my goodness gracious , look at your flowers .
have you ever seen anything more beautiful ?
miss dubose , the gardens at bellingrath have nothing to compare ... with your flowers .
i don' t think they' re as nice as last year .
he gets her interested in something nice so she forgets to be mean .
your yard is going to be the showplace of this town .
well , grand seeing you , miss dubose .
i had two cats ... which i brought ashore ... on my first raft .
and i had a dog .
atticus , do you think boo radley ever really comes and looks in my window at night ?
jem says he does .
this afternoon when we were over by their house ...
scout ...
i told you and jem to leave those poor people alone .
i want you to stay away from their house ... and stop tormenting them .
yes , sir .
that' s all the reading for tonight , honey .
it' s getting late .
what time is it ?
8 : 30 .
may i see your watch ?
to atticus , my beloved husband .
atticus , jem says this watch is gonna belong to him someday .
that' s right .
why ?
well ... it' s customary ... for the boy to have his father' s watch .
what are you gonna give me ?
i don' t know that i have much else of value that belongs to me .
but there' s a pearl necklace , there' s a ring that belonged to your mother .
i put them away , and they' re to be yours .

i' il send a boy over for you tomorrow when his hearing comes up .

the colored man ...
shh , shh .
the colored man looks to me like he' s cryin ' .

i wonder what he' s done to cry about ?

hey , howdy , cap' n .
mr. ewell .
cap' n , i' m real sorry they picked you ... to defend that nigger that raped my mayella .

i' d have saved you and the sheriff and the taxpayers lots of trouble .

i' m busy .
hey , cap' n , somebody told me just now that they thought ... that you believed tom robinson' s story agin ourn .

scout !
good morning , miss maudie .
you ready too ?
yes , ma' am .
scout !
what are you gonna do this morning with both children at school ?
i don' t know , and that' s the truth .
i was thinking about that just now .
scout !
scout ?
scout !
did you hear me , scout ?
now hurry .
hey , look at scout !
shh .
come on in here , scout .
have your breakfast .
i think your dress is mighty becomin ' , honey .
don' t go tugging at that dress , scout .
you want to have it all wrinkled before you even get to school ?
i still don' t see why i have to wear a darn old dress .
you' il get used to it .
i' m ready !
oh , jem .
jem .
it' s half an hour before school starts .
sit right down and wait for your sister .
hurry up , scout .
i' m trying to .
come on !
it' s your first day .
you want to be late ?
i' m ready .
let' s go !
bye .
bye , everybody !
darn you , walter cunningham !
come on , walter !
come on , walter !
scout !
come on , walter !
cut that out !
what do you think you' re doing ?
he made me start off on the wrong foot !
i was trying to explain to that darn lady teacher ... why he didn' t have no money for his lunch , and she got sore at me !
stop it !
stop it !
is your daddy mr. walter cunningham from old sarum ?
come home and have dinner with us , walter .
we' d be glad to have you .
our daddy is a friend of your daddy' s .
scout here is crazy .
she won' t fight you no more .
i hope that' s a dinner that you enjoy .
yes , sir .
i don' t know when i' ve had a roast .
we' ve been having squirrels and rabbits lately .
my pa and i go hunting in our spare time .
you got a gun of your own ?
uh huh .
how long you had a gun ?
oh , a year or so .
can i have the syrup , please ?
certainly , son .
cal , will you bring in the syrup dish , please ?
yes , sir .
how old were you when you got your first gun , atticus ?
thirteen or fourteen .
i remember when my daddy gave me that gun .
he told me that i should never point at anything in the house ... and that he' d rather i shoot at tin cans in the backyard .
but he said that sooner or later he supposed ... the temptation to go after birds would be too much ... and that i could shoot all the blue jays i wanted , if i could hit ' em ; but to remember it was a sin to kill a mockingbird .
why ?
well , i reckon ... because mockingbirds don' t do anything ... but make music for us to enjoy .
don' t eat people' s gardens .
don' t nest in the corn cribs .
they don' t do one thing but just sing their hearts out for us .
how' d you like school , scout ?
all right .
oh , thank you , cal .
that' s for walter .
what in the sam hill are you doing , wa ...
but , atticus , he' s gone and drowned his dinner in syrup ,
and now he' s pouring it all over ...
scout .
what ?
come out here .
i want to talk to you .
that boy is your company .
if he wants to eat that tablecloth , you' il let him .
if you can' t act fit to eat like folks , you can just sit here and eat in the kitchen .
scout .
scout .
scout , what in the world has got into you ?
i' m not going back .
now , now .
atticus , i' m not going back to school anymore .
now , scout , it' s just the first day .
i don' t care .
everything went wrong .
the teacher got mad as the devil at me ... and said you were teaching me to read all wrong and to stop it , then acted like a fool and tried to give walter cunningham a quarter ... when everybody knows cunninghams won' t take nothin ' from nobody .
any fool could have told her that .
well ... maybe she' s just nervous .
after all , it' s her first day teaching school and being new here .
oh , atticus ...
now , wait a minute .
if you learn this single trick , scout , you' il get along a lot better with all kinds of folks .
you never really understand a person ... until you consider things from his point of view .
sir ?
until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it .
but if i keep going to school , we can' t ever read anymore .
scout ... do you know what a compromise is ?
bending the law ?
uh ... no .
it' s an agreement reached by mutual consent .
now ... here' s the way it works .
you concede the necessity of going to school , we' il keep right on reading the same every night ... just as we always have .
that a bargain ?
there just didn' t seem to be ... anyone or anything atticus couldn' t explain .
though it wasn' t a talent that would arouse the admiration of any of our friends ,
jem and i had to admit he was very good at that .
but that was all he was good at ... we thought .
see ?
there he is .
scout , jem , come on inside .
come on !
come on .
get in .
mr. finch ?
this is cal .
i swear to god , there' s a mad dog down the street a piece .
he' s coming this way !
there he is .
he' s got it , all right , mr. finch .
stay inside , son .
keep them in there , cal .
he' s within range , heck .
take him , mr. finch .
oh , no , mr. tate !
he can' t shoot !
don' t waste time , heck .
he' s got to be killed before he starts runnin ' .
look where he is .
i can' t shoot that well , and you know it .
i haven' t shot a gun in years .
i' d feel mighty comfortable if you did now .
don' t go near that dog .
he' s just as dangerous dead as alive .
yes , sir .
atticus ?
yes , son .
nothin ' .
what' s the matter , boy ?
can' t you talk ?
didn' t you know your daddy is the best shot in this county ?
oh , hush , heck .
let' s get back to town .
remember now , don' t go near that dog .
yes , sir .
i' il send zeebo out right away to pick him up .
hey , atticus , can we go with ya ?
can we , please ?
huh , can we ?
i have to go to the country on business , and you' il just get tired .
oh , no , not me .
i won' t get tired .
well , you promise to stay in the car while i talk to helen robinson ?
mm hmm .
and not nag me about leaving if you get tired ?
huh uh .
all right , climb in .
who' s helen robinson ?
she' s the wife of the man i' m defending .
good evening , david .
good evening .
good evening , helen .
' evening , mr. finch .
i came over to tell you about my visit with tom .
yes , sir .
and to let you know that i got a postponement of the trial .
would you tell my daddy to come out here , please ?
you nigger lover .
no need to be afraid of him , son .
he' s all bluff .
nigger lover !
there' s a lot of ugly things in this world , son .
i wish i could keep ' em all away from you .
that' s never possible .
cal , if you wait ' til i get scout in bed , i' il drive you home .
yes , sir .
jem , do you mind stayin ' here with scout ' til i get cal home ?
no , sir .
' night , jem .
' night , cal .
atticus !
atticus !
atticus !
atticus had promised me he would wear me out ... if he ever heard of me fightin ' anymore .
i was far too old and too big for such childish things .
and the sooner i learned to hold in , the better off everybody would be .
i soon forgot .
cecil jacobs made me forget .
oh , what is it , scout ?
atticus , do you defend niggers ?
don' t say " nigger , " scout .
i didn' t say it .
cecil jacobs did .
that' s why i had to fight him .
scout , i don' t want you fightin ' .
i had to , atticus .
he ...
i don' t care what the reasons are .
i forbid you to fight .
yes .
anyway ...
i' m simply defending a negro , tom robinson .
now , scout , there are some things that ... you' re not old enough to understand just yet .
there' s been some high talk around town ... to the effect that i shouldn' t do much about defending this man .
if you shouldn' t be defending him , then why are you doing it ?
for a number of reasons .
the main one is that , if i didn' t ,
i couldn' t hold my head up in town .
i couldn' t even tell you or jem ... not to do something again .
scout .
you' re gonna hear some ugly talk about this in school .
that you won' t get into fights over it , no matter what they say to you .
yes , sir .
what are you doing ?
i' m walking like an egyptian .
we were studyin ' about ' em in school .
teacher says we wouldn' t be no place without ' em .
is that so ?
cradle of civilization .
they invented embalming and toilet paper .
that' s wrong , scout .
you do your feet this way .
look , jem .
look , the boy wears hair in front of his eyebrows like you do .
yeah , and the girl wears bangs like you .
these are of us .
jem , you awake ?
go back to bed .
i can' t go to sleep .
go back to bed .
what you got in the box ?
nothin ' .
go back to bed .
come on .
if i show you , will you swear never to tell anybody ?
i swear .
cross your heart .
i found all of these ... in the knothole of that old tree at different times .
this is a spelling medal .
you know they used to award these in school to spelling winners ... before we were born .
and another time , i found this .
and this .
scout ... you know somethin ' else i never told you about that night i went back ...
to the radley house ?
" somethin ' else " ?
you never told me anything about that night .
well ... the first time when i was gettin ' out of my britches ?
uh huh .
well , they was all in a tangle , and i couldn' t get ' em loose .
well , when i went back , though , they were folded across the fence , sort of like they was expectin ' me .
it was to be a long time ... before jem and i talked about boo again .
school finally ended and summer came ... and so did dill .
good mornin ' .
good mornin ' .
my , you' re up ... mighty bright and early .
ooh , i been up since 4 : 00 .
4 : 00 ?
oh , yes , i always get up at 4 : 00 .
it' s in my blood .
my daddy was a railroad man ' til he got rich .
now he flies airplanes .
one of these days , he' s just gonna swoop down here at maycomb , pick me up and take me for a ride .
who' s that in the car with sheriff tate ?
tom robinson , son .
where' s he been ?
in the abbottsville jail .
why ?
the sheriff thought he' d be safer there .
they' re bringin ' him back here tonight ... because his trial is tomorrow .
well , good evenin ' , heck .
good evenin ' , mr. finch .
come in .
the news has gotten around the county about my bringin ' tom robinson back to the jail .
i , uh , heard there might be trouble from that bunch out at old sarum .
cal , if i need you to stay here tonight , can you do it ?
yes , sir , i can .
thank you .
i think you better count on stayin ' .
yes , sir .
what' s goin ' on ?
shh .

what' s goin ' on ?
shh .
hey , there' s his car .
there he is over there .
no , scout , don' t go to him .
he might not like it .
i just wanted to see where he was and what he was up to .
he' s all right .
let' s go back home .

on the night of august 21 ,
on the night of august 21 ,
i was just leaving my office to go home when bob ...
mr. ewell came in .
very excited he was , and he said to get to his house as quick as i could , that his girl had been raped .
i got in my car and went out there as fast as i could .
she was pretty well beat up .
i asked her if tom robinson beat her like that .
she said , yes , he had .
i asked if he' d taken advantage of her .
she said , " yes , he did .
that' s all there was to it .
thank you .
did anybody call a doctor , sheriff ?
no , sir .
why not ?
well , i didn' t think it was necessary .
she was pretty well beat up .
somethin ' sure happened .
it was obvious .
now , sheriff , you say that she was mighty beat up .
in what way ?
well , she was beaten around the head .
there were bruises already comin ' on her arms .
she had a black eye startin ' .
which eye ?
let' s see .
it was her left .
well , now , was that , uh ...
that was her left , facing you ... or looking the way that you were ?
oh , yes , that would make it her right eye .
it was her right eye , mr. finch .
now i remember .
she was beaten up on that side of her face .
which side again , heck ?
the right side .
she had bruises on her arms and ... she showed me her neck .
there were definite finger marks on her gullet .
well ... all around her neck , at the back of her throat ?
i' d say they were all around .
the witness may be seated .
robert e. lee ewell .
place your hand on the bible , please .
do you solemnly swear to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , so help you god ?
i do .
sit down , please .
now , mr. ewell , you tell us , just in your own words , what happened on august 21 .
well , that night ...
i was comin ' from the woods with a load of kindlin ' ... and i heard mayella screamin ' as i got to the fence .
so i dropped my kindlin ' , and i run as fast as i could , but i run into the fence .
but when i got loose , i run up to the window , and i seen him with my mayella !
what did you do after you saw the defendant ?
i run around the house tryin ' to get in , but he done run through the front door just ahead of me !
but i seen who it was , all right !
i seen him .
and i run in the house and ... poor mayella was layin ' on the floor squallin ' .
then i run for mr. tate just as quick as i could .
mm hmm .
thank you , mr. ewell .
would you mind if i just , uh , ask you a few questions , mr. ewell ?
no , sir , mr. finch , i sure wouldn' t .
folks were doin ' a lot of running that night .
you say that you ran to the house , you ran to the window , you ran inside , you ran to mayella , you ran to sheriff tate .
did you , during all this running , run for a doctor ?
there wasn' t no need to .
i seen who done it .
now , mr. ewell , you' ve heard the sheriff' s testimony .
do you agree with his description of mayella' s injuries ?
i agree with everything mr. tate said .
her eye was blacked .
she was mighty beat up , mighty beat up .
now , mr. ewell , can you , uh ... can you read and write ?
yes , sir , mr. finch , i can read and i can write .
good .
then will you write your name , please .
write there .
show us .
so what' s so interesting ?
you' re left handed , mr. ewell .
what' s that got to do with it , judge ?
i' m a god fearin ' man .
that atticus finch , he' s tryin ' to take advantage of me !
you got to watch tricky lawyers like atticus finch !
quiet .

now the witness may take his seat .
mayella violet ewell .
put your hand on the bible , please .
do you solemnly swear to tell the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth , so help you god ?
sit down , please .
now , mayella ... suppose you tell us just what happened , huh ?
well , sir ...
sir ...
i was s sittin ' on the porch ... and he come along .
there' s this old chifforobe in the yard , and i i said ,
you come in here , boy , and bust up this chifforobe , and i' il give you a nickel .
so he come on in the yard , and i go in the house to get him the nickel ... and i turn around and before i know it , he' s on me .
i fought and hollered ... but he had me around the neck ... and he hit me , again and again .
and the next thing i knew , papa was in the room ... a standin ' over me , hollerin ' , " who done it ?
who done it ?
thank you , mayella .
your witness , atticus .
miss mayella , is your father good to you ?
i mean , is he easy to get along with ?
does tolerable .
except when he' s drinking .
when he' s riled ... has he ever beaten you ?
my pa' s never touched a hair on my head in my life .
you say that you asked tom to come in and chop up a ...
what was it ?
a chifforobe .
was that the first time that you ever asked him to come inside the fence ?
yes .
didn' t you ever ask him to come inside the fence before ?
i might have .
can you remember any other occasion ?
no .
you say , " he caught me , he choked me , and he took advantage of me .
is that right ?
do you remember him beating you about the face ?
no .
i don' t ... recollect if he hit me .
i mean , y yes !
h he hit me !
he hit me !
thank you .
now will you identify the man who beat you .
i most certainly will .
sittin ' right yonder .
tom , will you stand up , please ?
let miss mayella have a good long look at you .
tom , will you catch this , please ?
thank you .
now , then , this time , will you please catch it with your left hand .
i can' t , sir .
why can' t you ?
i can' t use my left hand at all .
i got it caught in a cotton gin when i was 12 years old .
all my muscles were tore loose .
is this the man who raped you ?
it most certainly is .
how ?
i don' t know how .
he done it .
he just done it .
you have testified ... that he choked you and he beat you .
you didn' t say that he sneaked up behind you and knocked you out cold , but that you turned around ... and there he was .
do you want to tell us what really happened ?
i got something to say ... and then i ain' t gonna say no more !
he took advantage of me !
and if you fine , fancy gentlemen ... ain' t gonna do nothing about it , then you' re just a bunch of lousy , yellow , stinkin ' cowards !
the whole bunch of ya !
and your fancy airs don' t come to nothin ' !
your " ma' am " ing and your " miss mayella " ing , it don' t come to nothin ' , mr. finch !
n n ...
you sit down now .
atticus .
mr. gilmer .
the state rests , judge .
tom robinson , take the stand .
put your hand on the bible .
do you solemnly swear to tell the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth , so help you god ?
i do .
sit down .
now , tom ... were you acquainted with mayella violet ewell ?
yes , sir .
i had to pass her place going to and from the field every day .
is there any other way to go ?
no , sir .
none' s i know of .
and did she ever speak to you ?
why , yes , sir .
i' d tip my hat when i' d go by .
one day she asked me to come inside the fence ... and bust up a chifforobe for her .
she give me the hatchet , and i broke it up .
and then she said , " i reckon i' il have to give you a nickel , won' t i ?
and i said , " no , ma' am .
there ain' t no charge .
and i went home .
mr. finch , that was way last spring .
way over a year ago .
did you ever go on the place again ?
yes , sir .
when ?
well , i went lots of times .
seemed like every time i passed by yonder , she would have some little something for me to do : chopping kindlin ' and totin ' water for her .
tom ... what happened to you ... on the evening of august 21 of last year ?
mr. finch , i was going home as usual that evening .
when i passed the ewell place ,
miss mayella were on the porch , like she said she were .
she said for me to come there and help her a minute .
well , i went inside the fence , and i looked around for some kindlin ' to work on , but i didn' t see none .
then she said to come in the house , she has a door needs fixin ' .
so i follows her inside , and i looked at the door ... and it looked all right .
then she shut the door .
all the time i was wondering why it was so quiet .
then it come to me .
there was not a child on the place .
and i said , " miss mayella , where are the children ?
she said , " they all gone to get ice cream .
she said it took her a year to save seven nickels , but she' d done it .
and they' d all gone to town .
what did you say then ?
well , i said something like ...
why , miss mayella , that' s right nice of you to treat ' em .
she said , " you think so ?
well , i said , " i best be goin ' .
i couldn' t do nothin ' for her .
and she said i could .
i asked her what .
and she said to just step on the chair yonder ... and get that box down from on top of the chifforobe .
so i done like she told me , and i was reachin ' ... when the next thing i knows , she grabbed me around the legs .
she scared me so bad , i hopped down and turned the chair over .
that was the only thing ... only furniture ... disturbed in the room , mr. finch ,
i swear , when i left it .
and what happened after you turned the chair over ?
tom ?
you' ve sworn to tell the whole truth .
will you do it ?
what happened after that ?
mr. finch ,
i got down off the chair , and i turned around ... and she sorta jumped on me .
she hugged me around the waist .
she reached up and kissed me on the face .
she said she' d never kissed a grown man before ... and she might as well kiss me .
she says for me to kiss her back , and i said , " miss mayella , let me outta here , " and i tried to run .
mr. ewell cussed at her from the window .
he said he' s gonna kill her .
and what happened after that ?
i was runnin ' so fast , i don' t know what happened .
tom , did you rape mayella ewell ?
i did not , sir .
did you harm her in any way ?
i did not , sir .
robinson , you' re pretty good at bustin ' up chifforobes and kindlin ' with one hand , aren' t ya ?
strong enough to choke the breath out of a woman and sling her to the floor ?
i never done that , sir .
but you' re strong enough to .
i reckon so , sir .
mm hmm .
how come you so all fired anxious to do that woman' s chores ?
looks like she , she didn' t have nobody to help her .
like i said , she ...
with mr. ewell and seven children on the place ?
you did all this choppin ' and work out of sheer goodness , boy ?
you' re a mighty good fella , it seems .
did all that for not one penny ?
yes , sir .
i felt right sorry for her .
she seemed ...
you felt sorry for her ?
a white woman ?
you felt sorry for her ?
to begin with , this case should never have come to trial .
the state has not produced one iota ... of medical evidence ... that the crime tom robinson is charged with ... ever took place .
it has relied , instead , upon the testimony of two witnesses ... whose evidence has not only been called into serious question ... on cross examination , but has been flatly contradicted by the defendant .
there is circumstantial evidence to indicate that ...
mayella ewell was beaten savagely ... by someone who led , almost exclusively , with his left .
tom robinson now sits before you having taken the oath ... with the only good hand he possesses , his right .
i have nothing but pity in my heart ... for the chief witness for the state .
she is the victim of cruel poverty and ignorance .
but my pity ... does not extend so far ... as to her putting a man' s life at stake , which she has done in an effort to get rid of her own guilt .
now i say " guilt , " gentlemen , because it was guilt that motivated her .
she' s committed no crime .
she has merely broken a rigid and time honored ... code of our society ... a code so severe that whoever breaks it is hounded from our midst ... as unfit to live with .
she must destroy the evidence ... of her offense .
but what was the evidence of her offense ?
tom robinson , a human being .
she must put tom robinson away from her .
tom robinson was to her a daily reminder ... of what she did .
now , what did she do ?
she tempted a negro .
she was white , and she tempted a negro .
she did something that , in our society , is unspeakable .
she kissed a black man .
not an old uncle , but a strong , young negro man .
no code mattered to her before she broke it , but it came crashing down on her afterwards .
the witnesses for the state , with the exception of the sheriff of maycomb county . have presented themselves to you gentlemen , to this court ... in the cynical confidence ... that their testimony would not be doubted .
confident that you gentlemen would go along with them ... on the assumption ... the evil assumption ... that all negroes lie , all negroes are basically immoral beings , all negro men are not to be trusted around our women .
an assumption that one associates with minds of their caliber , and which is , in itself , gentlemen , a lie , which i do not need to point out to you .
and so , a quiet , humble , respectable negro , who has had the unmitigated temerity ... to feel sorry for a white woman , has had to put his word against two white people' s .
the defendant is not guilty , but somebody in this courtroom is .
now , gentlemen , in this country , our courts are the great levelers .
in our courts , all men are created equal .
i' m no idealist to believe firmly ... in the integrity of our courts and of our jury system .
that' s no ideal to me .
that is a living , working reality !
now i am confident that you gentlemen will review ... without passion ... the evidence that you have heard , come to a decision ... and restore this man to his family .
in the name of god , do your duty .
in the name of god , believe ...
tom robinson .
how long has the jury been out now , reverend ?
well , let' s see .
almost two hours now .
i think that' s an awful good sign , don' t you ?
court' s now in session .
everybody rise .
gentlemen of the jury ,
have you reached a verdict ?
we have , your honor .
will the defendant please rise and face the jury ?
what is your verdict ?
we find the defendant guilty as charged .
gentlemen , this jury is dismissed .
court is adjourned .
i' il go to see helen first thing tomorrow morning .
i told her not to be disappointed , we' d probably lose this one .
tom .
yes , mr. finch .
miss jean louise .
miss jean louise , stand up .
your father' s passin ' .
atticus ?
i i' m sorry , atticus .
well , thank you , maudie .
atticus , can i see you for a minute ?
will you excuse me ?
jem ?
yes' m .
i don' t know if it' il help , but i want to say this to you .
there' s some men in this world ... who are born to do our unpleasant jobs for us .
your father' s one of them .
oh , well .
what' s the matter , atticus ?
tom robinson' s dead .
they were taking him to abbottsville ... for safekeeping .
tom broke loose and ran .
the deputy called out to him to stop , and tom didn' t stop .
he shot at him to wound him and missed his aim .
killed him .
the deputy says ...
tom just ran like a crazy man .
the last thing i told him was not to lose heart , that we' d ask for an appeal .
we had such a good chance .
we had more than a good chance .
i have to go out and tell his family .
you look after the children , maudie .
atticus , you want me to go with you ?
no , son , i think i' d better go out there alone .
atticus .
i' m goin ' with you .
i' m goin ' with you .
all right , son .
hello , mr. finch .
i' m spence , tom' s father .
hello , spence .
is helen here ?
yes , sir , she' s inside lyin ' down , tryin ' to get a little sleep .
we been talkin ' about the appeal , mr. finch .
how long do you think it' il take ?
spence , there isn' t going to be any appeal .
not now .
tom is dead .
dead ?
helen .
boy .
go inside and tell atticus finch i said to come out here .
go on , boy .
by october , things had settled down again .
i still looked for boo every time i went by the radley place .
this night my mind was filled with halloween .
there was to be a pageant representing our county' s agricultural products .
i was to be a ham .
jem said he would escort me to the school auditorium .
thus began our longest journey together .
scout !
yeah ?
will you come on ?
everybody' s gone .
i can' t go home like this .
well , i' m goin ' .
it' s almost 10 : 00 ... and atticus will be waiting for us .
all right , i' m comin ' .
but i feel like a fool walkin ' home like this .
it' s not my fault you lost your dress .
i didn' t lose it .
just can' t find it .
where are your shoes ?
i can' t find them either .
you can get ' em tomorrow .
but tomorrow' s sunday .
you can get the janitor to let you in .
come on .
here , scout .
let me hold onto you before you break your neck .
jem , you don' t have to hold me .
shh .
what' s the matter ?
hush a minute , scout .
i thought i heard somethin ' .
ah ... come on .
wait .
jem , are you trying to scare me ?
shh .
you know i' m too old .
be quiet .
i heard an old dog bayin ' .
it' s not that .
i hear it when we' re walking along .
when we stop , i don' t hear it anymore .
oh , yeah , my costume rustlin ' .
halloween' s got ya .
i hear it now .
i' il bet it' s just old cecil jacobs tryin ' to scare me .
cecil jacobs is a big , wet hen !
come on .
run , scout !
run , scout !
run !
run !
scout !
scout !
what happened ?
what happened ?
i don' t know .
i just don' t know .
cal , tell dr. reynolds to come over .
yes , sir .
you all right ?
yes , sir .
are you sure ?
yes , sir .
sheriff tate , please .
atticus , is jem dead ?
no .
he' s unconscious .
we won' t know how badly he' s hurt until the doctor gets here .
heck ?
atticus finch .
someone' s been after my children .
he' s got a bad break .
like somebody tried to wring his arm off .
i' il be right back , atticus .
how' s the boy , doc ?
he' il be all right .
sheriff tate .
what is it , heck ?
bob ewell' s lyin ' on the ground under that tree down yonder ... with a kitchen knife stuck up under his ribs .
he' s dead , mr. finch .
are you sure ?
yes , sir .
he' s not gonna bother these children anymore .
miss scout , you think you could tell us what happened ?
i don' t know .
all of a sudden somebody grabbed me , knocked me down on the ground .
jem found me then .
then mr. ewell , i reckon , grabbed him again , and jem hollered .
then somebody grabbed me .
mr. ewell , i guess .
somebody grabbed him ... and then i heard someone pantin ' and coughin ' .
then i saw someone carrying jem .
well , who was it ?
why , there he is , mr. tate .
he can tell you his name .
hey , boo .
miss jean louise , mr. arthur radley .
i believe he already knows you .
heck , let' s go out on the front porch .
would you like to say good night to jem , mr. arthur ?
you can pet him , mr. arthur .
he' s asleep .
you couldn' t if he was awake , though .
he wouldn' t let you .
go ahead .
let' s go set in the swing , mr. arthur .
heck , i i ...
i guess that the thing to do is , uh ...
good lord ...
i must be losin ' my memory .
i can' t remember whether jem is 12 or 13 .
anyway , it' il have to come before the county court .
of course , it' s a clear cut case of self defense .
i' il , uh ...
well , i' il run down to the office ...
mr. finch ... do you think jem killed bob ewell ?
is that what you think ?
your boy never stabbed him .
bob ewell fell on his knife .
he killed himself .
there' s a black man dead for no reason .
now the man responsible for it is dead .
let the dead bury the dead this time , mr. finch .
i never heard tell it was against the law for any citizen ... to do his utmost to prevent a crime from being committed , which is exactly what he did .
but maybe you' il tell me it' s my duty to tell the town all about it , not to hush it up .
you know what' il happen then .
all the ladies in maycomb , includin ' my wife , will be knockin ' on his door bringin ' angel food cakes .
to my way of thinkin ' , takin ' one man , who done you and this town a big service , and draggin ' him with his shy ways into the limelight ...
to me , that' s a sin .
it' s a sin .
and i' m not about to have it on my head .
i may not be much , mr. finch , but i' m still sheriff of maycomb county , and bob ewell fell on his knife .
good night , sir .
mr. tate was right .
what do you mean ?
well ... it would be ... sort of like shooting a mockingbird , wouldn' t it ?
thank you , arthur .
thank you for my children .
neighbors bring food with death ... and flowers with sickness ... and little things in between .
boo was our neighbor .
he gave us two soap dolls , a broken watch and chain , a knife ... and our lives .
one time atticus said ... you never really knew a man until you stood in his shoes and walked around in them .
just standing on the radley porch was enough .
the summer that had begun so long ago had ended , and another summer had taken its place .
and a fall .
and boo radley had come out .
i was to think of these days many times , of jem and dill ... and boo radley and tom robinson .
and atticus .
he would be in jem' s room all night , and he would be there when jem waked up in the morning .
