you know the problem with hollywood ?
they make shit .
unbelievable , unremarkable shit .
i' m not some wannabe filmmaker ... ... searching for existentialism through a haze of bong smoke .
no , it' s easy to pick apart bad acting , shortsighted directing ... ... and a moronic stringing together of words the studios term as prose .
no , i' m talking about the lack of realism .
realism .
not a pervasive element in modern american cinematic vision .
take dog day afternoon , for example .
arguably pacino' s best work .
short of scarface and godfather part 1 , of course .
masterpiece of directing , easily lumet' s best .
the cinematography , the acting , the screenplay , all topnotch .
but ...
... they didn' t push the envelope .
what if , in dog day sonny wanted to get away with it ?
really wanted that .
now this is the tricky part .
what if he started killing hostages right away ?
no mercy , no quarter .
meet our demands or the pretty blond gets it in the head . " bam , splat .
what , still no bus ?
come on .
how many innocent victims would it take for the city ... ... to reverse its policy on hostages ?
and this is 1 976 .
there' s no cnn .
there' s no cnbc .
there' s no internet .
fast forward to today .
present time , same situation .
how quickly would the media make a frenzy ? in hours .
it would be the biggest story from boston to budapest .
ten hostages die .
twenty , thirty .
relentless .
bam , bim .
one after another .
all on hi def , computer enhanced .
you can almost taste the brain matter .
all for what ?
a bus , a plane ?
a couple million dollars that' s federally insured ?
i don' t think so , but ... ... just a thought .
i mean , it' s not ... ... within the realm of conventional cinema , but ... ... what if ?
there' s a problem with that movie .
really ?
it wouldn' t work .
how come ?
audiences love happy endings .
pacino escapes with the money .
boyfriend gets a sex change .
live happily ever after .
no ?
no .
homophobia .
bad guy can' t win .
it' s a morality tale .
one way or the other , he' s gotta go down .
well , life is stranger than fiction sometimes .
you know , guys , i gotta go .
gotta jet .
thanks for the coffee .
stan .
time to go to work .
you coming ?
move .
i won' t say it again .
1 have a clear shot .
shooters , stand by .
okay .
now what ?
don' t worry , folks , it' s almost over .
is she done ?
she' s done .
move her out .
don' t worry , you' il be fine .
you' il be back before you know it .
turn the fuck around .
rescue team , let' s go .
who' s on the roof ?
all shooters , you are holding for command .
you' re doing good .
behave yourself .
look over there , and there .
all prepare their shot .
what are you doing ?
i' m handling this !
don' t fuck with this guy !
you' il get these people killed !
we got two teams on the roof .
we got a team over there .
double this team up .
that' s your best angle .
don' t talk .
just listen .
each of the 22 hostages is wrapped with 20 pounds of c 4 explosives .
they' re also taped with 1 5 pounds of stainless steel ball bearings .
which makes them the world' s largest claymore mines .
they got the green light .
i got this guy on the phone !
i' m done playing with this asshole !
around their necks are radio frequency electronic dog collars .
dog walks out of the yard , gets the shit shocked out of him .
same here .
this bank is their yard , so don' t fuck with me .
johnson , you and your partner move up between those vehicles .
stand down !
get back !
get back !
officer , stand down now !
he' s gonna shoot !
he' s gonna shoot !
shit .
get her !
go !
no !
release the hostage !
no !
release the hostage !
she' s gone .
take cover !
no , no !
let her go !
let her go !
release the hostage !
help me !
let her go .
let her go !
jesus .
shit !
you guys , come on !
how long will you be here ?
one week .
business or pleasure ?
hopefully both .
what type of work do you do ?
i' m a consultant .
excuse me .
could you be careful with that ?
that' s expensive equipment .
how long will this take ?
a few minutes .
sit down , relax .
i' il be right back .
a few minutes , huh ?
hey , where' s he going ?
it' s going up .
stairs .
sir , could you please ?
easy , easy .
this better be important .
wouldn' t have asked you otherwise , senator .
we just received word that axl torvalds was intercepted entering the u. s.
when was this ?
within the last two hours .
according to my fbi source , he was nabbed in customs at lax .
they know he' s working for us ?
it' s unlikely .
it was a routine check .
torvalds freaked out .
they got lucky .
this ain' t good .
what do the feds know ?
nothing yet .
he' s refusing to speak english .
the finnish consulate has contacted the state department .
so we haven' t been compromised ?
i' m not sure .
i' m working on that .
you better get sure because someone' s cock will end up on the block ... ... and it won' t be mine .
i understand , senator .
there you go .
well , well , well .
who are you supposed to be ?
i' m ginger .
ginger , huh ?
where' s gilligan ?
for someone the nsa once listed as the most dangerous hacker in america ... ... you sure don' t look like much .
surprised ?
i know everything about you , stan .
what are you selling again ?
my employer wants to meet you .
shit .
you' re not too good at golf .
you' re fucking up my chi .
let me have that .
this is not a nice place you got here , stan .
here 5 minutes , and i already feel sorry for myself .
you' re wasting your time .
i touch a computer , i go back to leavenworth .
do not pass go , do not collect $200 .
if i knew you were coming , i might have cleaned up .
i' m not here to suck your dick , stanley .
he' il pay you just to meet you .
i gotta go to work .
right .
great work greasing pump jacks .
so ... ... spoke to holly lately ?
shit !
hello ?
melissa .
is holly home ?
why are you calling here ?
i just want to talk with holly .
1t' s saturday .
she' s at soccer .
it' s illegal for you to talk to her .
don' t do this , mel .
it' s not good for holly .
how would you know what' s good for my daughter ?
you spent the last two years in prison .
mel .
stop calling me that , stanley .
look , i just ....
i just want to see my baby .
well , she doesn' t want to see you , stanley .
and i swear , if you try to contact her ... ... i' il have you thrown in a hole so dark ... ... leavenworth will seem like two weeks in vegas ... ... during which i will personally ... ... pay two skinheads to make a playground out of your ass .
you can take the girl out of the trailer park ... ... but can' t take the trailer park out of the girl .
i will not let myself be manipulated by you , stanley .
larry' s her father now .
larry' s the porn king of southern calif
larry is a film financier .
the films he chooses are for profit and none of your business .
get help .
get into a program , get a therapist , get a dog .
but whatever you do , stay away from my child .
your child ?
she' s our child .
she will never be your child .
forget holly .
what are you still doing here ?
look , i' m beginning to lose my sense of humor .
then i' il cut to the chase .
if you want your daughter back , you better listen up .
unless you want to stay here in this loser existence ... ... while your daughter grows up to be a fluffer in her new daddy' s videos .
please don' t confuse your own childhood with my daughter' s .
and look at your situation , stanley .
for the past 20 months , you' ve been in and out of court 6 times ?
each time your case was thrown out .
situation doesn' t look good , sweetheart .
how much money would it cost to hire the best family lawyer in the country ?
a lot .
come here .
come here .
judas .
that should get you started .
hundred grand .
what do you got to lose ?
he just wants to meet you .
one time .
you don' t like the situation ... ... walk away .
and that' s it ?
that' s it .
and you keep the money .
what did he say ?
all right , look , look .
your client is wanted on 24 counts of electronic crimes ... ... in 7 different countries .
he has a finnish passport .
these allegations are not recognized as crimes .
your laws don' t apply .
do you see a finnish flag hanging on the wall , ikea boy ?
what did he say ?
he said ikea is swedish .
he understands english , huh ?
let me talk to him .
he' s all yours .
you' re fucked up now , hamlet .
the thing is , they have you put the furniture together yourself .
my client has reserved his right not to answer any questions .
why would the best hacker in the world ... ... risk life imprisonment by coming into the continental u. s. ?
okay , what did he just say ?
he never misses an episode of survivor .
did he really say that ?
you' re funny .
how much do you weigh ?
how much do i weigh ?
we' il call you if we need you .
eat a dick .
wipe that smile off your face .
a year ago , i was head of the largest cyber criminal task force in the world .
but i burned out .
i snapped .
i shot a suspect in the hand .
you know how difficult it is to work a keyboard with one hand ?
you don' t understand .
whatever you want to do to me , he' il do worse .
i' m already dead .
my only chance is back in europe .
i have friends there .
tell me what i want to know .
you' il be on the first thing smoking .
first class .
courtesy of the u. s. government .
who is he ?
i don' t know his name .
you work for him .
you don' t know ?
tell me something .
i' il tell you what i know .
he exists in a world beyond your world .
what we only fantasize , he does .
he lives a life where nothing is beyond him .
but you know what ?
1t' s all a facade .
for all his charm and charisma , his wealth , his expensive toys ... ... he is a driven , unflinching , calculating machine .
he takes what he wants , when he wants ... ... and disappears .
so how do i find him ?
you don' t find him .
he finds you .
here' s how it works .
his people pick me up .
take me to him .
he tells me what he wants me to do .
1 do the job right there .
1 get paid , and 1 leave .
that' s a really nice story , but you haven' t told me shit , have you ?
excuse me , sir .
you have a call .
take a message .
it' s assistant director joy .
he said it' s important .
i can only tell you what i' ve done for him .
well , that' s a start .
thank you .
you' ve just let my client go free .
you denied his right to counsel  excuse me .
yeah , and you eat the dick !
yes , i got a call from a. d. joy .
this is roberts .
hold for just one moment , sir .
joy .
yeah , roberts .
you needed me .
you didn' t call ?
no , roberts .
what do you want ?
you should' ve let me buy you a suit , stanley .
i' m happy with what i' m wearing .
ignorance is bliss .
miss me ?
stanley , gabriel .
big stan .
nice suit .
thanks .
they say the clothes make the man .
you buy it ?
hope not .
drink ?
i flew 1 500 miles for this meeting .
how about we get to the point ?
no .
actually , you flew 1 500 miles for 100 grand .
but that' s not the point .
helga .
meet stanley .
hello , stanley .
helga .
look , i don' t have a lot of patience , gabriel .
maybe you can help me with something .
take a look at this .
you know i can' t touch that .
do you like tequila , stanley ?
this is bullshit .
you want something from me , and i from you .
dod d base , 1 28 bit encryption .
what do you think ?
impossible ?
nothing' s impossible .
good .
maybe slide in a trojan horse hiding a worm ?
is this an interview ?
sort of .
marco .
give him some incentive .
hey , what are you doing ?
relax , stanley .
i have been told that the best crackers in the world ... ... can do this in 60 minutes .
unfortunately , i need someone to do it in 60 seconds .
you' re kidding .
afraid not .
go .
get up , get up !
fifty five .
get on with it .
what the hell is this ?
time' s a wasting , big guy .
oh , jesus .
forty five seconds .
oh , she' s good , isn' t she ?
what' s going on here ?
jesus christ .
more time , more time !
come on , stan !
twenty .
nineteen .
fifteen .
come on .
ten .
nine .
three .
two .
one .
too bad .
you gotta die .
no , wait !
i was just fucking with you , stan .
that' s our guy .
get away from me .
i really want to help you , stan .
like you helped me in there ?
that was a test , stan .
a test .
and you passed .
i don' t know why i let you talk me into this .
you' re saving your daughter .
i' d do anything for her , but if i end up in a box or in jail ... ... then i really can' t help her .
i' m taking my money and going back to court !
with your little $100, 000 ?
melissa will throw $500, 000 back at you .
think !
i' m thinking that you' il put a gun to my head just to see if i can
i can' t pee in front of an audience .
let me break it down to you , stanley , one last time .
you live in a trailer .
you' re a felon .
you work a dead end job .
and you desperately want your daughter back .
gabriel is your only shot .
take it .
i' m concerned about our new friend .
oh , now , don' t be jealous .
i don' t see him dragging his sorry arse over the finish line .
thought we lost you .
tell me what the deal is .
the deal is that we' re having a little gathering at the house .
come and i' il explain it to you there .
gentlemen , if it' s not good news , don' t say it .
actually , we have a ray of hope in the darkness of your life .
when we grabbed torvalds at the airport , these two guys were there .
check this out .
recognize those two same guys , a few hours later .
and then ... ... guess who shows up .
stanley jobson .
wired magazine' s 1 996 man of the year .
a burnout now , but the hacker zeitgeist then .
yeah , i know jobson , i arrested him .
why are you in l. a. , stan ?
his ex wife and daughter live in malibu .
the new husband owns backdoor films , a shady porn production house .
the production value' s good , considering that they shoot on video .
his wife is in some of the videos .
i know .
she' s like an actress .
that' s great .
are you done ?
who' s the girl ?
actually , sir , we don' t know yet .
she' s a serious piece of talent .
man , she' s way out of his league .
find out who she is .
sit on the ex wife' s house .
you got it .
stanley , you want to get wet ?
i don' t have a suit .
you don' t need one .
come on , stan .
later .
some view .
let' s get a drink .
pool lights on .
so how did you do it ?
do what ?
break the code .
i dropped a logic bomb through the trap door .
no , you didn' t .
you didn' t have time .
what' il you have ?
scotch .
you can do better than that .
i used a password sniffer .
how did you do it ?
i don' t know exactly .
i see the code in my head .
i can' t explain it .
let me show you something .
pretty impressive , huh ?
so , what we need from you is a worm .
a hydra , actually .
a multiheaded worm to sniff out digital footprints across an encrypted network .
what kind of cipher ?
a vernam encryption .
the key code is destroyed upon implementation .
and it' s a true 1 28 bit encryption .
well , actually , we' re talking a 51 2 bit .
that' s definitely not possible .
what if i give you 10 million dollars ?
that would cover all your problems .
yes ?
unless , of course , it' s not possible .
but you think about it .
it won' t bite you .
i promise .
this is not just a multi screen system .
it has a ds 3 connection .
we can access 7 different networks simultaneously .
it has a central encryption you have to crack to utilize the system .
try it .
it' il be hard without a gun to my head .
maybe i should put a gun to your head .
i thought you were gabriel' s .
i' m not what you think i am .
ginger .
you surprised that a girl with an iq over 70 can give you a hard on ?
so is it impossible ?
nothing' s impossible .
good .
so we have a deal .
morning .
you mean afternoon ?
can i borrow your car for something ?
sure .
there you go .
thank you .
hey , stan , if you' re going to see holly ... ... l suggest you re evaluate the way you look .
just a thought .
just a thought .
come on , mom , pick up .
mom late again ?
she' il be here in a minute .
hi .
can i have the phone number for yellow cab ?
need a lift ?
daddy !
oh , what are you doing here ?
i missed you so much .
oh , i missed you too , baby .
i brought you something .
oh , my gosh .
it' s so cute .
oh , dad .
if mom finds out , she' il have you thrown in jail .
it' s okay , baby .
you want a lift home ?
of course i do .
come here .
all right .
you are heavy .
nice car .
hey , thanks .
is that mommy' s car ? is she home ?
that' s my stepdad' s car .
so listen to me .
i found a way for us to be together .
i don' t want anything to happen to you .
everything' s going to be fine .
everything' s going to be okay .
just trust me .
i love you , daddy .
i love you .
come here .
oh , god .
you go home .
okay ?
bye .
i miss you .
i miss you too .
go .
oh , sweetheart .
hey .
come here .
it' s okay .
go .
go .
go .
who the hell are you ?
a friend of a friend .
shit .
oh , fuck .
fuck !
hold it !
stanley !
go !
oh , fuck .
oh , fuck !
don' t move !
don' t move .
come here .
look at this .
what were you running for ?
you arresting me ?
for violating your parole by leaving texas without permission ?
or evading an officer and almost getting me killed in the process ? !
no , i' m not arresting you .
then why are we talking ?
what are you doing in l. a. ?
vacationing .
vacationing , right .
the judge is allowing you to see your daughter ?
fuck you .
fuck you ?
oh ?
you just want to get right down to it ?
okay , fine .
i can help you with your daughter .
you help me , i' il help you .
you' il have to forgive me .
the fact that ... ... you put me in jail doesn' t inspire trust .
you put a virus in an fbi program and set it back two years .
they were reading isp subscribers ' e mail .
it was illegal .
i did what the judges wouldn' t do !
you broke the law !
we both did what we had to do .
and your program is back in full swing .
nice trip down memory lane , but if you aren' t arresting me
not getting a lot of cooperation here .
i ran into your friend torvalds the other day .
he was vacationing too .
what are the odds of you being in l. a. at the same time ?
i' m just a sucker for disneyland .
we done ?
good .
tell torvalds i said hello .
you can tell him yourself if you' re not careful .
he' s dead .
give me a card .
you think of anything to say , call me .
sorry about your nose .
you' re in way over your head .
i know .
you want me to watch him ?
yeah , set it up .
i' ve had a shitty day so far , but i think it just got worse .
either shoot me , or tell me why you' re wearing that wire .
can' t do that .
who are you , ginger ?
i can' t tell you .
who are you ?
he' il kill me if he finds out .
that' s not my problem , is it ?
you' re asking for a lot of faith without giving me any .
you brought me into this mess .
i deserve to know who' s playing me .
who are you ?
i' m dea , stanley .
holy shit .
we' re after gabriel .
give him the worm ... ... take the money and get out of here .
that' s all .
this looks friendly .
you know me , i' m a friendly girl .
come on , stanley .
let' s get coffee .
here you go .
thank you .
ever heard of operation swordfish ?
no .
then you' il appreciate the irony .
triple espresso .
two .
okay .
in the ' 80s , the dea set up a network of dummy corporations ... ... as a front to launder drug money and gather evidence .
but these companies started to make a lot of money .
in 1 986 , when it was terminated , $400 million was in these accounts .
money that just sort of disappeared .
it didn' t disappear .
it sat , earning interest .
that' s 1 5 years ago .
you know how much money that is today ?
nine and a half billion .
this is a sweet deal .
we go in over the phone lines , pop the firewall ... ... drop in the hydra and wait for the money .
aren' t you getting ahead of yourself ?
to access the cluster , you need a bank on the backbone of the network .
know how long that' il take to find ?
not a problem .
look behind you .
cheers .
these fellows might wear armani ... ... but they have the swagger of ex military .
maybe bodyguards , but they look like mercs to me .
something' s going on .
they have two ds 3 trucks .
that' s serious bandwidth .
thermal scopes show a huge heat load .
could be mainframes .
the house was listed by celebrity estates .
it was leased two weeks ago by a blind corporation .
no other info on them yet .
wait a minute , joe .
blue shirt , pinstripe .
oh , yeah , that' s him .
that' s our man right there .
just in time to watch stanley find our worm .
in college , i created the source code for the worm i use .
in the basement is the only pdp 10 still active and on the internet .
not many people know it .
it' s an its machine , kept online for historical sake .
i hid my worm there , where no one would ever look .
voila .
good man .
good man .
senator , we have a problem .
senator .
seems you' re in a predicament .
1s that right ?
i don' t follow .
download your file .
senator  you know where i got these ?
from the deputy director of the fbl .
he thought i might be interested .
sir , do you think there is any aspect of this operation i am not aware of ?
we are aborting the operation .
take a vacation .
a vacation ?
have i ever failed you , sir ?
that' s not really the point , is it ?
it' s my point .
you' re losing sight of our objective .
the risks are too great .
we' il seek alternative means of finance .
this operation is moving ahead .
everything is under control .
son ... ... let' s just say you' ve got a 200 pound rottweiler .
now , he loves you .
it' s his job to protect you .
but if he bites you , you got to put him down .
can never tell who he might bite next .
you understand ?
yes , i do understand , senator .
i think we got a team on the west coast .
fort macarthur .
maybe they should pay our friend a visit .
come on .
network ip range .
confirmed .
please confirm .
confirm .
confirm .
we are cruising !
oh , yeah .
next .
and next .
too easy .
no , don' t .
no , no , no .
yes !
three percent , please .
oh , fuck .
i' m fucked .
no , no , no .
fuck you !
shit , there' s no fucking way .
i' m rusty .
rusty .
come on , come on .
okay .
time to disguise you ... ... as an internal destruction .
quick , quick .
thank you .
return .
three , two , one , go .
come on .
come on .
yeah .
close .
yes .
oh , baby .
now i' ve just got to modify the code .
the bank' s ids logs every packer ... ... that go to any port other than the 22 or 80 tcp .
holy shit .
okay , chateau attigue 1996 .
white , white .
nope .
come on , come on .
here we go .
twenty six .
ninety six .
nine
oh , shit !
what' s the matter ?
you look like you' ve seen a ghost .
we gotta talk .
let' s take a drive .
can' t we talk here ?
we shouldn' t .
ever heard of harry houdini ?
he wasn' t like today' s magicians , only interested in television ratings .
he was an artist .
he could make an elephant disappear in a full theater .
you know how he did that ?
misdirection .
what are you talking about ?
misdirection .
what the eyes see and the ears hear , the mind believes .
what' s going on ?
we' ve got a tail .
hold on .
shit .
jesus .
jesus !
take the wheel .
what ?
take the wheel !
holy shit !
who are those guys ?
jesus !
what the fuck are you doing ?
jesus !
drive , stan .
move !
i can' t drive this thing .
learn !
move it .
come on !
hard left !
hard left !
keep going !
go !
get in the car .
not until you tell me what i' m involved in .
look , stanley , i like you .
you' re on my good side .
but don' t confuse kindness with weakness .
you have 1 2 hours to get the hydra .
so get in the car .
stanley , are you okay ?
i just saw that maniac murder people in the street .
i' m fucking great .
you can' t leave .
it' il all work out .
you gotta trust me .
trust you ?
yeah .
you' re dea , i got the feds up my ass and i don' t know what' s going on here .
if we don' t find out who he works for , we' il have to start over .
that' s not my problem .
i don' t care who he works for .
what about holly ?
do you give a shit about her ?
finish the job .
we' il get your daughter back .
i promise .
ah , the great american outdoors .
yet i never understood the appeal of fly fishing .
a bit too much like masturbation for me without the payoff .
this is a catch and release stream , isn' t it ?
yeah , i believe it is .
you must see the irony in that , senator .
chairman of the subcommittee on crime fishing in a catch and release stream .
how could you do it to me , jim ?
after all we suffered .
i' ve changed my identity so often i don' t know who i am anymore .
how could you do it ?
we were so close to our goal !
the fbi was watching you .
you tried to kill me .
you' ve misplaced your loyalty , senator .
you' ve sold out america .
patriotism does not have a four year shelf life .
but politicians do .
what are you doing with that ?
thomas jefferson once shot a man for treason .
hold the phone .
thomas jeff
stan .
how are you ?
fine .
finished ?
1s this stanley jobson , social security number 66954731 1 ?
1' m calling from credit suisse to notify you ... ... that $ 10 million was transferred into your new account .
as promised .
thanks .
so i' m done , then .
soon .
walk with me .
against my better judgment , i' m going to tell you who i am .
i know who you are .
do you ?
i think you think i' m a bank robber .
but the truth is , i' m just like you .
like me ?
no .
because you' re a murderer .
that i am , and worse .
but i do have ethics .

you disappoint me .
it' s the greatest good .
how about 10 innocents ?
now you get it .

you' re just a terrorist .
you' re wrong , stanley .
