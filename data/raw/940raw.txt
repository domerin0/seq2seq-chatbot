you' re sure about this ?
here , sons .
my silver medal drink .
from the bartending contest ?
right , 1986 .
who won ?
lehikoinen , but with jury tactics
not the bartender from our pub ?
the same son of a bitch
silverdick !
what did he do ?
got the jury so drunk that his halfwit brother was the only member sober enough to vote
there' s no justice in the world .
let' s drink to that
don' t spill it on the register , jussi' s gonna get mad
jussi !

lade , hey .

if something should ever happen to me ...
you know how your brothers are ...
now what would ever happen to you ?
forget it , dad .
we' il be fine
right on
look at them ...
i say nothing .
you didn' t read me my rights
they only do that in america .
and we' re not as good as them , eh ?
i can' t go to jail , i already have a tattoo .
cool , isn' t it ?
how could i have recognized dad he was wearing a mask ?
so it was just a coincidence that the whole hirvonen family was there ?
no , it wasn' t .
we' re all kind of fond of booze
and the only place to get it the liquor store
i got so drunk in the end i wouldn' t recognized my own father
and i didn' t , did l ?
what was the question ?
i' il go straight to the answer
your father gets charged and the rest of you get the hell out of here
thou shalt not play god
a man tried it once , with pretty ugly results
erkki valtteri hirvonen will be to prison for 2 years
the other suspects are found guilty in lack of evidence and are to be released
you guys owe us a lot of money .
no kidding ?
don' t be so cocky
either you pay , or you die and pay
and if you were planning to leave town , think about the old man
see him running with that ball and chain ?
this ain' t funny
pig and sty are an ugly lot you' d better disappear for a while .
and leave dad in trouble ?
you' re not worth shit without your father
and your landlord' s been looking for you .
it' s about the rent
10 e says matula gets beaten up twice
and we die six times over .
six is my best bet too
no visitors .
we' re in mourning
fuck off !
situation over , timo !
shut up
this just keeps getting better
congratulations , guys .

it means that bread makes her fart
goodbye boredom .
hey guys , do we have any bread ?
hey , lade ... guys .
yeah ?
help !
what' s wrong with her ?
what do you think ?

ask her yourself
i don' t speak child .
hey bulk , do you speak child ?
no , but lade does
lade , hey .

leave it to us experts
this is where i sleep at home too .
this is where she sleeps at home
you speak child really well .
is she a child or a dog ?
here , girl , fetch !
lade , can you interpret ?
so what do we do now ?
how the hell should i know ?
what did you do as a kid when you were feeling bad ?
jumped on the bed , drank booze and went out stealing
not necessarily in that order
and then my all time favorite ... 360 degrees
bulk used to play jumping over the river when he' d pee in bed
piranha river , piranha river ...
get lost , lade
and you can fall on your back like this and it doesn' t hurt
hey , it' s saara' s turn .
there' s not enough room for us all
you have to wait for your turn
come on , try it
i can jump .
there' s not enough room
ok , start jumping , just small bounces , hop , hop , hop ...
i' il just jump here then
then try higher .
over the river and back
watch out for the piranhas ...
higher , higher , 360 degrees !
guys , we just need a plan .
so start fucking making one
i' m gonna go pick a fight .
with whom ?
anyone .
wait , i' il come with you
where are you going ?
anywhere
i brought the midget back .
thanks very much for the loan
it' s his bastard .
he don' t pay , he takes care of her
you can' t be serious .
try me
sit right there .
she' il let you in soon
no free dlstrlbutlon a hundred for a shag
so the others couldn' t make it ?
i guess they' re scared .
it' s not easy when things change
maybe you boys should move some place where no one knows you
i' il be okay here .
don' t worry , we' il sort it out
i just have to get the boys back in line which may be more easily said than done
you never told us about saara , then ?
it was just a one night stand
i didn' t find out about saara until she was born
and by then i had my hands full with the four of you
i just never got around to it .
she came over last night
that figures .
not a very cheerful child
hardly surprising , if you look at her folks
but we' re her folks too !
wanna fight ?
sure
i bet you a cookie that the guy did it
the mutant .
you' re on
you fucking faggot !
come back here !
you can' t have this ...
go bulk , go ...

come on , get up !
east side' s the best !
power karaoke

we' il come back later to see if it' s fixed .
ok
good work , saara
is that the first money you ever got ?
yeah

the mike' s howling !
if you' re feeling alright , clap your hands !
clap in your pants !
i' ve got good news and bad news
first the bad news !
no , first the good news !
i listed the bad news first
we' re broke , we' re on a hit list , and dad' s in jail
those were the good news ?
but we have lots of chips and cheese puffs and ...
yeah , two whole bags .
one of each 16 liters of flat beer in a jerry can , save some for us , bulk ... and it tastes like diesel oil .
petrol
i said diesel oil .
petrol !
hey , let me finish ...
and save the condoms .
we can still use them
how can i talk when the whole house is falling apart around me ?
keep talking , it' s a great speech .
we won' t interrupt anymore
you' re the family funny man .
let' s give him a little big hand
go on , it' s a good speech .
and then we have this new korean ...
chlnese !
karaoke set . and a new family member
thanks a hell of a lot .
let' s party !
now that we' re done with warm up , let the karaoke contest begin
and now let' s see who' il be the first performer
and his name is ...
eros ramazotti !
that' s me
he' il do a song called " tears of despair
yes , my name really is eros ramazotti
take it away , eros !
i wrote this song especially for tonight
it goes like this
you left , and the fields were flooding
the stars died out , and the wind was howling
the rivers were filled with tears of despair
this song is so timo .
and now the synthesizer
the night ends and a new day dawns so bright
oh home , sweet life ...
how i love you ...
i can' t sing .
i' ve got a terrible cold
thank you , bulk .
saara , do you want to sing ?
that' s okay .
you don' t have to
but let' s give saara a big hand for helping with the party !
ladies and gentlemen , here' s tonight' s main act ...
boy !
this one goes to dad
see the tree how big it' s grown but friend it hasn' t been too long it wasn' t big
i laughed at her and she got mad the first day that she planted it was just a twig
then the first snow came and she ran out to brush the snow away so it wouldn' t die
came running in all excited , slipped and almost hurt herself
and i laughed ' til i cried ...
it' s ok , we' il manage somehow .
we are the hirvonens , after all !
hell , i ' m a hirvonen !
i' m a hirvonen , you hirvonen ?
me hirvonen too ...
saara , come out .
you sang great , there' s nothing to be ashamed of
what' s going on here ?
nothing .
go back to bed
i' ve gotta take a leak .
don' t shout , you' il scare her !
what are you , parent of the year ?
i' il explain in the morning
a miracle has happened .
better wash the coffee pot then or you' il have cafe au miracle in the morning
saara , hey .
please come out
and now i present you our new super kid , saara
saara is going to sing us a song called " love' s last farewell
press the button and it' il start
that' s one hell of an artist you signed up
very funny .
when you have no idea what' s going on
at her pace you' il sell at least a hundred gigs a night
was she good , really ?
hell , yeah
so maybe it' s a stupid idea , but what have we got to lose ?
that' s it .
i' m gonna go pick a fight
well ?
i haven' t finished my donald duck
you really believe in that super kid shit ?
what' s there to lose ?
if pig and sty see we' re trying , it could buy us some more time while we think of something better .
what say you , brother timo ?
i' d see it as a better alternative than selling our internal organs
give me a ... pass ... so ...
what ?
glve me a backstage pass so i can take a shlt !
did i articulate myself clearly enough ?
i' m drawing helmets on the ducks
lade , these are in alphabetical order .
look what i found
eagles don' t use stairs
that' s it .
i' ve fucking had it !
do you have any books that make kids go la la ?
we have some song books .
do they work ?
in what way ?
do they make kids go la la ?
it doesn' t work that way .
so you don' t know , huh ?
i wonder what you get paid for !
i made the logo of the employment office .
it' s missing the spot
that looks better .
it' s 3 d !
i' m the michelangelo of multivitamins
what ... oh , great helmets !
now donald won' t hurt his head
listen : for healthy self confidence , involve the child in daily tasks
i can teach her to fight , if someone else buys her the booze
they' re referring to a normal family , you idiot
are you saying we' re not normal ?
what' s normal , anyhow ?
dad' s in jail , four grown men living under the same roof ...
never done an honest day of work ...
between the four of us , we get laid once a year , if we' re lucky
we' d do a higher average if boy did his bit
now i eat the employment office
hey , i found it child who refuses to do something developmentally essential or doesn' t wish to learn some new , significant skill can be inspired to do so in form of play
huh ?
it' s singing time
i made you an employment office too
did you now ?
sure did
i' m not letting it burn !
how is it ?
c minus
let me stir .
i' il keep the stove on , then
and you !
start setting the table .
in form of play , remember ?
you look cool with those crumbs flying out your mouth .
you too
hey saara , let' s play this food game
the guys and i are murderers on our way to the gas chamber
and as our last wish , we ask for soup
or slurp , as we call it here
you' re the warden and you bring us spoons and plates ...
and knives so we can cut each other' s stomachs open
you know what' s inside a human being ?
all that great stuff like guts , we can use them as noodles ...
sounds fun , huh ?
yeah , but it' s more like a boys ' game
i' m a boy , i think .
but she isn' t
you play with her then
never mind him .
his games have always been kind of violent
he' s the family idiot
look , barbie' s dancing happily like this .
do that trick !
we girls can do anything ...
and suddenly she becomes possessed ...
see ?
" i come from hell ...
what' s with her ?
spoiled shitless , that' s all
but the evil' s still in the woman !
brother bulk , pass the holy water !
coming up !
vade retro spiritus ...
spiritus vade retro ...
let go , you demon !
saara , we have this little custom to sing a food song before eating
what' s the song called ?
the food song .
yes !
i copied the words so we can all sing together
all rise
i wanna learn it by heart .
just read it from the paper
but i have musical ambitions .
stand up , smartass
well , if we' re in a rush .
on the count of four : one , two ...
gee , it' il taste so good .
i can smell the food
the eggs are frying on the pan , then i run so fast , oh man
hey , that' s enough .
knock it off
... then i run so fast , oh man .
see , i learned it by heart !
and without using your hands .
without using my hands
i won
you shouldn' t pick on someone smaller
no huh ?
wanna stay hanging up there for the rest of the day ?
i' m gonna throw up on you .
hey lade , she' s one of us !
and now the final moments of " look who' s singing now " are at hand
you know the rules .
you have to guess who' s singing on tape
let' s start with the first sample
that was you .
yup , it was me
ok , lets move on .
here' s the next one
roots ... beet roots ...
it must be a monster .
it was sepultura
or at first it was ... but then i improvised
yeah , so much for that .
let' s give timo a little big hand
and now to our last contestant ...
where' s the sarcasm now , bulk ?
great soundtrack for the snuff film we' il make about you
the song' s not bad
the voice was a bit hissy .
might be due to the microphone
what do you say ?
let' s talk
when' s the contest ?
halfway through august
how much can you get from it ?
twenty grand
you' il pay us fifteen in august , or you' re dead
snuffed out
snuffed indeed
how much time do we have ?
3 weeks , and that' s the good news
the kids are selected for regional trials on the basis of the tapes
and in the finals they have also interviews and a talent section
what the hell is that ?
a display of a child' s talent in an optional field
drinking , stealing and farting excluded
shit , our special fields of expertise .
i was kidding , moron
phew .
i' d hate to see a good case of celiac disease wasted
we need someone to coach saara .
this won' t work otherwise
saara hey , come here .
we need some personal details for this ... ...
housing department form
did you see my lollipop ?
a froggypop !
it' s saara' s .
put it away or she' il go mad .
it' s my froggypop
you' re not thinking of asking that singing barfly to help us ?
remember as kids when mom took us to see her sing at the mall ?
the mall sucks .
security cameras everywhere
well , it' s not like we did do much stealing back then .
nope
sorry we' re late .
laura drove
quit showing your ass to everybody , you slut !

dammit , an ace !
hey , wanker !
hey , it' s the faggot brothers .

it' s the feta cheese in a greek salad , you moron
you' re gonna fucking die now !
why don' t you just sit down ?
no one asked you anything
sit the fuck down !
we' d like to speak to the lady here
i' m gonna take this dog for a walk .
no animals allowed in here
your company can' t be worse than them for an old kebab like me
old kebab ?
meat gone around , half cow , half sheep
is that an old saying ?
i just made it up
wow !
what a beautiful voice .
would you coach her ?
thanks but no thanks .
i' ve quit the music scene
say hi to your father from me
bulk , come on out !
remember the legwork , you have to keep moving
when bulk moves , you move !
saara hey , you can' t stop .
keep the legs moving !
now in time with the music , faster !
don' t let him get near you !
go , go , keep the rhythm .
keep spinning , don' t stop !
close the gap !
who' s gonna get this trophy ? !
don' t let him get near you !
start moving your mouth towards the ears
as high up as you can , higher ...
all the way up to the ears , showing your teeth ...
there you go .
now flash your teeth
not like a grimace but more relaxed ...
now pull the sides of your mouth ever ever closer to the ears ...
and don' t forget to blink your eyes
great , very good .
now !
there' s a smile !
and now a series of punches .
great , and bulk falls down
now come here , quickly .
put your foot on top him
and then the smile
excellent , saara .
it' s a good start
are you ready ?
here goes ...
and now do the boxing stuff .
what ?
box to the tune of the song
the other hand .
not the one with the mike
now the smile .
like when you won the match
now turn around slowly .
i can' t , i need to see the words
need to see the words , huh ?
just turn around bravely
look up at us
she fainted
at least the mike' s still working
this karate kid method of yours is a real killer
i' ve had it with you pissass bums !
you guys could at least try !
give me a christmas special , lehikoinen
so you came here looking for trouble ?
yeah ... like a tattoo here saying " juhis and laura forever " ...
you can always have the arm cut off ...
oh shit , that fucking queen wants you !
where ?
ok , boys .
let' s beat the shit out of that faggot !
aren' t you guys so tough .
yeah , and hard in the right places
does this turn you on ?
in your dreams
it turns me on .

all set ?

laura !
hi .
what are you doing here ?
thought you might use the backdoor .
oh ?
have you thought about my offer ?
sorry , but i' m done with music
if you can' t face your past , you' il find it in your future
what the fuck do you think you know about my past ?
nothing .
i' m sorry
and the book where i read that line sucked , anyhow
got a light ?
crappy flat , lousy food , ugly and horny flatmates ...
you get two grand if we win , to give you a fresh start
that' s a really shitty offer
you' ve got an hour to pick up your stuff
i saw the homo hop in there
see you not !
let' s go
that' s bulk .
hi .
laura
and the next one' s boy .
hi , i' m boy
and that' s timo .
hi .
laura ... hi ...
hl .
hi
anyone want the rest ?
so what do we do now ?
have you told her your plan ?
we have like ... sort of hinted ...
so you haven' t told her anything ?
that' s one way of putting it .
good .
does she drink coffee ?
yeah , with lots of milk and two sugars
should i go get her ?
no
bulk , stop staring !
i mean it
good morning
it' s okay , i just brought you some coffee
i' m laura , i' m a friend of the boys
i' m saara .
hi saara
do you like it here ?
are the boys nice ?
well , lade' s nice .
but timo' s kind of weird
what have you guys been doing ?
singing and fighting
you know i heard you sing on tape .
it sounded really beautiful
you must like singing ?
i get scared when there' s someone listening
would you let me teach you ?
yeah , but teach the boys too
their singing is awful , and they never stop
ok , i promise .
for sure ?
for sure
the trick is not to think about the audience at all
just pick one nice person in the audience whom you sing to
and when you see that that one person likes your show you know everyone else likes it too
what if he doesn' t like it ?
don' t worry , he will
i got it .
if i had boy with me when i was trying to pick up a girl she' d keep her eyes fixed on him , and i could feel her up in the meantime
man , you guys are stupid !
nice touch , boys .
are you ready ?
ok , guys .
out you go .
we' il try it alone first
lade' s the nice one .
nice lade .

i' d like to try on a leather jacket , but they' re chained to the rack
could you ... ?
i' il come and show it to you
i' m taking these home to be fitted .
the girl must have missed a tag
let' s go and check the files
what name is it under ?
hirvonen .

it' s good to keep an eye on things
she must have missed one of the tags .
yeah , it happens sometimes
a performing outfit for my sister .

save me , save me ...

come on , sweetie .
sing mommy a little song
just a small one , just to stay in tune
come on , have a cookie .

haven' t you got any respect for your mother ?
she gave birth to you , bought the cookies and everything
let' s hear you sing
now let me tell you something .
give me that cigarette ...
i brought you to this world with blood and tears you have no idea what it' s like
i' m asking you to sing , and you bloody hell refuse to
you are driving me fucking crazy
i' m gonna start kicking that bastard around soon .
spoiled little brat ...
mommy loves you so .
she just wants to hear her baby sing
mommy loves you so much
hey , guys .
did you like the gift ?
yeah , we gave it to bulk as an advance on his inheritance
we dropped by for coffee , now that we are neighbors
bring out the artist for a matinee .
she happens to be ...
she' s visiting her mom
too bad .
what do we do now ?
we can have chinese take away
we' il chop , but you ain' t gonna sue !
you' re an ugly fucker , but tell me ... which is your prettier half ?
i' m the prettier half !

fucking great
get your ass out of here , bitch
shut up , slut !
bye then .
mommy' s going to drop by and see you soon
i' m the single parent seal , and you' re the puppy seal
and they go to visit bob the polar bear and his newborn baby
how do the hands go ?
like this
but they' re called flippers
now let' s go
here comes a norwegian seal hunter to kill the seals ...
you can' t have my baby !
the puppy' s just what i' m after
watch out , boys !
watch out !
happy birthday , saara
but it' s not my birthday
since you' ve never had a birthday party we wanted to make up for it before you reach the big ten
there' s at least a hundred candles on it
forty five , for each candle missed so far
now blow them out , quickly !
blow , blow ... excellent !
here you are .
thank you
here you are .
thank you
it' s kind of silly , so can you open it later ?
wow , they' re great
aren' t they kind of alike ?
it doesn' t matter , because this guy doll is the magician and the girls are his assistants .
and because they all look alike they can be in different places all at once
that' s just what we had in mind
remember those tricks you used to show us as a kid ?
do you have names for the dolls ?
what tricks ?
never mind
tell us , tell us , tell us !
i knew a few stupid magician' s tricks as a kid , nothing ...
a few stupid tricks ?
they were supergreat !
at least better than that song , remember ...
show us a trick .
show us , show us , show us !
i' m not sure i remember how .
it' s been so long
how did you do that ?
a magician never tells his secret
except for lade .
remember the contest ?
shit , i' d forgotten all about that talent section
will you teach me ?
yeah .
starting now
you know what , laura ?
what ?
i' m so happy

and then you switch sides , you pull it tight ...
make it tight , and i' il put my hands ...
hi there .
hiya ho
hey honey .
show mom your little trick .
go on , boys
how' bout you leave us alone ?
we' re just practicing
you won' t let me stay and watch my little girl perform ?
she and i have a long career ahead of us after the contest
hey , it' s just this one gig and we promised you a share .
so get lost
you think i' d let scum like you take all the cream off the cake ?
in your dreams , sonny .
you bloodsucking leech !
shut up , prick .
show mommy .
get the hell out of here !
take your hands off me !
stop ...
get out !
you seem kind of worried again
are you nervous about the contest ?
no , but i ...
what are you worried about ?
i don' t want to be a singer
i really appreciate that you' ve been teaching me and stuff ...
and i don' t want to leave the boys in trouble
and if i win , i get to go to the amusement park
but i never thought about what' s going to happen afterwards
you think your mom was serious ?
yes , and it' s going to be so awful
everything' s going to be alright
lade , hey ...
i' m so fucking stupid
i never thought that witch would come up with plans for saara
i should have known if anyone
whatever happens in the contest , we lose
so which one do we sacrifice , dad or saara ?
lade , hey .
we' il think of something
should i be proud of you ?
yes ! .... or damn if i know ...
guess what ?
we' re going to the amusement park !
good !
how' s the backside ?
well , it still gives a flat imitation of a bagpipe
better than nothing
what do you think will happen after all this is over ?
i don' t know .
but let' s not think about it yet
everything will turn out fine .
you just have to seize the moment
my life has really changed since i left home
i used to sleep on a mattress on the floor
it was this thin
and you know what ?
you couldn' t jump on it !
know what ?
i happen to be a champ at this !
have you ever seen green and red dots ? " i do now
look , you can see them if you go like this
bulk , you' re the man !
room service !
timo , you know they show porn on cable tv ?
that' s tasteless
porn is tasteless ?
now bulk is gonna say that he' s having the time of his life
what else can i do ?
i' m a sensitive summer dude
god , these kiddy bottles really mess you up
but luckily i brought their daddy along
have you ever collected ants ?
" only when i used to collect ants
have you ever drank up a whole glass of water ?
only after mistaking salt for sugar
hey , for a bunch of idiots we' re not such total idiots
yes , we are .
and here' s to it !
daddy bottle , kiddy bottle ...
please stay seated , we are about to go on air
and please see that your mobile phones are switched off ...
ladies and gentlemen , parents of the contestants all our tvviewers , welcome to the finals of the super kid contest !
10 talented , young contestants have been selected in countrywide trials
let' s give them a nice round of applause !
and the first prize is , as you all know
a brand new opel astra with 20 000 euros in the backseat
and here to assure that everything happens by the book are two officers of the law , constables risto mikkonen and arto nordstrm
hi .
my name is veera .
i' m saara
hey kids !
isn' t it past your bedtime ?
yeah , where' s winnie the pooh ?
winnie the poop is in your pants !
boys are so stupid .
yeah , or not all of them
the trick i am about to perform requires two volunteers
how about you two gentlemen in the front row ?
please hold the ends , and then switch sides , tighten the rope
and do the same again .
to make me more comfortable
now you press the top , and you make a knot
you appear to be wearing a perfect magic jacket
could you put it on top here , being that my hands are tied ?
and now ladies and gentlemen , do you believe that i can untie myself on a count to ten ?
no !
in that case , start counting !
one , two , three ...
stop , stop ...
a little slower , please
like this : one , two ...
two , three ...
sir , could you please stop speaking on the cell phone ?
i' m trying to concentrate here
this is not working out .
can you please carry me out ?
so pasi , what do you value the most in life ?
i guess that would be my hamster
my parents .
without them i wouldn' t be here today
well , what would we do without charming hosts like you ?
and what do you , saara , value the most in life ?
my brothers and laura , who is my best friend
and what are you going to become when you grow up ?
i haven' t even turned ten yet .
isn' t it a bit too early to tell ?
do you have a cell phone ?
no , not yet
can i have your address so i can write to you ?
i don' t really have an address either
how come ?
everyone i know has an address
it' s a long story .
but i can write to you first
oh god , i' m so nervous
and our next contestant is ...
saara mkinen !
oh no !
you' il do great
something' s gotten hold of my heart keeping my soul and my senses apart
something' s gotten into my life cutting its way through my dreams like a knife
turning me up and turning me down
making me laugh and making me frown
in a world that was small i once lived in a time there was peace with no trouble at all
but then you came my way and a feeling unknown shook my heart made me want you to stay all of my nights and all of my days
i gotta tell you now
saara , are you okay ?
what happened ?
did she have a fit or something ?
dammit !
there goes the money
everyone , please keep calm
all the excitement must have been too much for her
and now while we' re waiting , a few words about our sponsors ...
how can you talk about sponsors when a little girl just fainted !
anything might have happened !
shame on you !
have you no feelings at all ?
howdy
what' s there to applaud ?
they lost
sure they did , but my son made a great speech
the production company doesn' t wish to make an issue out of this
i have here an official apology obliging you not to give any press interviews
sign right there
it' s a pity though .
the girl was excellent
this really killed her chances in show biz
we' il just have to live with that
can we leave now ?
it' s not really a police matter .
i guess you' re free to go
and the winner is ...
veera airaksinen from lahti !
wow , we pulled off one hell of a talent section , didn' t we ? !
we just do the interviews tomorrow , and then we' re in the clear
it pissed me off though that the car wasn' t even locked
lade' s speech was so touching i almost cried
and i nearly forgot to steal the money
how did you manage to keep a straight face backstage ?
it wasn' t easy , believe me .
i didn' t even dare look at lade
unfortunately this really killed your chances in show biz
hey , it was a joke
gotcha !
i should become an actress
don' t ever do that again
and you' re not even ten yet , so it' s too early to tell
i made that up myself because that host was such a jerk
his questions were so stupid
let' s give a nice round of applause to saara from joensuu !
you were fantastic !
there goes .
pearls for pigs and sties
saara , your share of the money is in the same locker as laura' s
you two can do something fun with it together
i' il kick your ass if you start crying
the same goes for you too
and me too
cool !
you' re wasting your time on us .
we' re on the same side as you
the guys and i were thinking of starting a detective agency
if nature calls , we' il tap the line and arrange surveillance
kind of like matula , but specialized in bodily fluids
really , i almost fainted when i saw her faint .
she was doing so great
did you see that jenni whomever doing the ballet ?
stuck in this victorian type scenario
you lost the money yourselves , and now you try to frame us
i saw a movie where the same thing happened
the cops were charged , the chair sparked and the hound of hades barked
and it wasn' t even a nature film
do you work out ?
the bad cop routine is not gonna work on me ...
do you like nature films ?
i guess not , since nature doesn' t draw a line between good and evil .
it puts the police out of business
i' m not speaking , not even if you cut my head off
actually , especially not then .
hey , a joke !
you ever watch matula ?
it' s a german detective series .
it' s so best
