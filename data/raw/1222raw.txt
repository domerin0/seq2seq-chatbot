well , it all happened so fast and it was dark ,
well , i saw it , it was a wolf , but bigger , it was like a monster wolf ,
yeah , jimmy , i have your statement already ,
fine , don' t believe me , i know what i saw ,
what happened to her .. , what kind of an animal could do that ?
a mountain lion , a bear , maybe .
there hasn' t been a wolf sighting in southern california in over 70 years ,
mountain lion , my ass , jimmy ,

i' m sorry , but i don' t know what else to say ,

jake , what' s going on ?
i' m just scared , ellie ,
i' m scared ,
i never expected to meet a woman like you ,
jake , you' re the only good thing that' s happened in my life in a long time ,
i' m scared too ,
i' m terrified , because all the good things keep going away ,
i' m not going anywhere ,
here in los angeles , a young woman was attacked and killed by an unidentified wild animal when her car ran off the road last night , high in the hollywood hills . the victim' s name has yet to be released .
it happened on a remote stretch of mulholland drive , shortly before midnight .
animal control officers speculate that it might have been a bear that wandered into the area in search of water .
it is the first such fatal attack in los angeles ...
hey , how are you doing # did you sleep ok ?
i woke up in the bushes ,
you woke up where ?
are you feeling ok ?
i' m calling dr , steinberg ,
no , no , i' m fine , really , actually .. , i feel kinda great ,
ok ,
but i' m gonna make an appointment , they said we should follow up with another shot ,
for all we know , that wolf could' ve had rabies ,
oh , oh , so now it' s a wolf ,
jimmy , i never said it wasn' t , i just said i didn' t see it ,
it was more like a werewolf ,
and i found this website last night and according to legend , a werewolf feeds during the lunar cycle that' s the three nights around the full moon ,
last night was the first moon of the lunar cycle ,
why can' t you just download porn like other teenage boys ?
excuse me for trying to make conversation ,
ok , so what would a werewolf be doing in la ? shouldn' t it be off in the countryside somewhere , terrorizing helpless maidens ?
maybe it' s a hip werewolf , maidens come here with the perfectly implanted breasts ,
you should get to school , hey , i was bitten by a werewolf ,
if that' s not good enough for a sick day .. , i could be cursed ,
everybody' s cursed , jimmy , it' s called life ,
no , i mean by the mark of the beast ,
is that what the kids are calling it these days ?
here you go , thanks ,
whoa , hey , ellie , hey , kyle ,
hey , ' 70s retro week is booking up , do we want keith partridge or marcia brady ?

yeah , maybe , let me know when you' re sure ,
just ignore him , jimmy ,
let' s get out of here before we get homo stained ,
hey , hey ,
# now the party' s jumping , the place is packed
# but when the crowd' s like this i' m ready to rap
# but before i could bust a thyme on the mic
# freaks are all over me like white on rice
# freaks come in all shapes and sizes and colors
# but what i like about them most is that they' re real good lovers
# they do it in the park , they do it in the dark
# but most freaks are known for breaking hearts
joannie ,
joannie , there you are ,
what is this # come as your favorite endangered species ?
obnoxious , isn' t it ?
i just feel a little underdressed without a tail ,
well , that' s part of your charm , take this , i will tell scott that you' re here ,
well , i think you look fantastic ,
what are you doing here ?
i needed to see you ,
what about the opening ?
disappearing for a few days ,
that didn' t go over so well , did it ?
you know what # it' s fine ,
we' ve only been seeing each other a couple of months , you need your space ,
i get it , it' s fine ,
please don' t do that , don' t try to make everything ok when it' s not ,
can i talk to you in private for a second ?
ellie , that was my mo for a long time , when anything would get too close or too serious ,
i would just run away ,
for .. ,
for a variety of reasons that i can' t even begin to go into ,
i don' t want to do that with us , this thing , you and me , this is special , ellie , and i just don' t want to lose you , so i was hoping that , maybe , you could just bear with me for a little while longer ,
i guess i' m learning about these things as we go along ,
well , maybe i' il finish up here and we can go someplace to talk ,
ok , thank you , ellie ,
well , hi , there , remember me ?
uh .. ,
jenny tate , becky morton' s friend , right , of course , jenny ,
it' s good to see you again , i was actually .. , jake ,
hi , hi , long time no see , sorry to interrupt an awkward moment , but we' re ready for you ,
i have to go ,
ellie , i' m working , so , becky cannot stop talking about you , she' s gonna die when she finds out you were here ,
excuse me , i have to go ,
i know it was only a couple of dates , but becky is really bummed you haven' t called ,
next time you speak with her , tell her i' m sorry , but i' ve taken myself off the market ,
now i' m nummed ,
thanks for coming , i appreciate it , see you later ,
scott , this is ellie myers from the craig kilborn show ,
oh , hi , how are you ?
hi , it' s a pleasure to meet you ,
i' ve been a huge fan of yours ever since happy days .
thank you , listen , i appreciate you meeting me here , i couldn' t bail on tonight ,
it' s fine ,
you guys have a nice chat , i' il be over here if you need me ,
ok ,
have a seat , thank you ,
craig is so excited to have you on his show ,
i think it' s gonna be just a fabulous line up ,
you' il be going on third , after ashton kutcher and carrot top ,
third ?
uh .. ,
i thought that we would start with a chachi clip , and then move on to something from charles in charge .
original , and , uh .. , and then we could .. , segue into what you' re doing now ,
what are you doing now ?
you know , you' re a beautiful girl ,
i mean , you' ve got this aura thing happening , l .. ,
i just can' t quite put my finger on it ,
not when you can use your whole hand ,
thank you , i think that' s really all we needed to discuss and i' il see you in the studio ,
ok , you got it , ok ,
wanna finish your drink ?
no , bye ,
okey doke ,
excuse me ,
hey , where are you going ?
call us !
ellie ,
ellie , wait up ,
jake , i really don' t feel well tonight , i just wanna get home ,
be careful with this one , he' s trouble ,
who' s the leopard ? someone i met before i met you ,
they keep popping up , don' t they ?
ellie , that was a previous life ,
please , you gotta trust me on this ,
you know what ?
i think it' s my turn to be weird ,
i' m gonna take a cue from you and disappear for a few days ,
ellie , people can change ,
i really don' t wanna get into it right now ,
close , close , close , close !
oh , my god ,
hello # hello # anybody there ?
hello # hello ?
get me the fuck out of here !
open up !
hey , hi ,
are you doing homework ?
i' m just reading up on how you kill a werewolf , silver , right ?
no , you actually have to separate the head from the heart , silver just hurts a lot ,
it might not be such a bad deal , think about it , increased strength , heightened senses , an unnatural sexual allure ,
when do we sprout hair and pointy ears ?
it' s all a little sketchy , but maybe never , maybe tomorrow ,
the experts can' t really agree on that one ,
you' re starting to freak me out , jimmy , this is fiction , myth ,
we live in reality , come back to the other side ,
i know , i know , but the line between fiction and fact has always been a thin one ,
don' t we have enough problems # do you really wanna add this one to the list ?
ok , here , check this out , here ,
it' s a five pointed star , it' s a pentagram ,
it' s the mark of the beast ,
jimmy , this is ridiculous , you need .. ,
whoa , jesus ,
wait , is this for real ?
last night was difficult , ok ?
the wreck , the girl dying , it brought up a lot of stuff ,
no , no , no , ellie , don' t start with that , i know we don' t talk about it enough ,
it has nothing to do with mom and dad , i miss them too ,
your hand , it' s a creepy coincidence ,
this is some pretty freaky shit , admit it ,
ok , ok ,
let' s put it to the test ,
i bought this frame myself , three years ago ,
it' s from tiffany' s , it' s sterling silver ,
now , if i' m a werewolf , i shouldn' t be able to pick it up , right ?
it should hurt me , right ?
according to chapter four , yeah ,
go to bed , jimmy , it' s late ,
shut up !
shut up ,
don' t forget , i' m working the opening of tinsel tonight ,
i' ve gotta take craig down the red carpet , ok ,
hello ?
hey , jake' s been calling all morning , says he needs to talk ,
well , i don' t need to talk to him , what' s with the gypsies ?
oh , it' s auditions for craig' s sance segment , what is with this new look ?
what are you talking about ?
i' m not complaining , i think you look hot ,
you' re in danger , excuse me ?
it will come for you ,
don' t let this getup fool you , i' m not a joke , i' ve got the gift , i blame my mother ,
why are you talking to me ?
you bear the markings of the beast ,
look , i' m not trying to freak you out , but you' ve been infected , you' re cursed ,
you' ve got to sever the line of the beast , it' s the only way to break the curse ,
ok , all psychics back in their seats , please ,
the beast is human too , don' t forget that ,
and it' s closer to you than you think , if you could just follow me , shouldn' t you psychically know when you' re annoying someone ?
thank you ,
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , excuse me , miss , get up and get out ,
look at him ,
yeah !
oh , brooke , hey ,
are you stalking me ?
maybe ,
what' s going on , brooke ?
you going fruit fly on me ?
actually , we were just talking , but , if you don' t mind .. , shoo ,
oh , you are asking for it , abercrombie ,
come on , bo , you' re really becoming transparent ,
how about a little identity intervention , ok ?
' cause all this internalized homophobia' s giving you away ,
you better watch your ass , what' s going on ?
i' m just giving jimmy some pointers ,
he' s here to try out for the team , really # you ?
are you sure you want to do that , jimmy ?
oh , sure he does , coach ,
i' il tell you what , i' il wrestle him ,
no , louie , you and jimmy take the mat ,
jimmy , suit up ,
he' s so dead ,
ok , limp wrist , stay away from my groin ,
take him down , louie , take him down ,
have you had enough ?
uh uh ,
let him up ,
watch his nails , lou !
he might scratch your eyes out !
you ok , lou ?
all right ,
let me take a crack , coach , are you up for it , jimmy ?
yeah ,
go for it , bo ,
come on , fairy , shake your dust , you' d like that , wouldn' t you ?
come on , fag , what ?

wait , no .. ,
you know the best part about being a fairy ?
you get to fly ,
jimmy !

ashton kutcher' s up first , god , he' s so overexposed , stick to his film career as talk points , don' t linger on the tv stuff ,

ok , you know what ?
i' ve done this before ,

i' m gonna let the top go long , randy' s dealing with it ,
ok , my mouth' s dry ,
thanks ,
you want me to do that ?
i got it , ouch , dammit !
look ,

do you have a tissue ?
just stare at it ,
it' s the late late show with craig kilborn .
ok , go , go !
you' re on ,
mr , craig kilborn ,
excuse me , excuse me , ellie ?
what the fuck do you mean , ' scott s been bumped ? '
i just heard , we' il reschedule , reschedule , my ass ,
i' m sorry , the show was running long , then bump carrot top ,
it' s scott baio , he shouldn' t be going after carrot top anyway ,
he should be first , i' il make it up to you ,
listen to me , you little .. , don' t start with me !
hi , ellie ,
are you ok in there ?
i' m fine ,
you don' t sound fine ,
what' s the matter ?
ellie ?
no ! ,
ellie ,
ellie , your hand ,
ellie ,
what' s wrong ?
i' m just having a really bad day ,
just leave ,
can i help ?
get the hell out of here !
get out !
hey , jake ,
jimmy , hey ,
cool place , are all clubs like this ?
i sure hope not or i' m in nig trouble , so what' s up , jimmy ?
what are you doing here ?
yeah , l .. , i kind of need someone to talk to , is that ok ?
yeah , of course it is , step inside ,
ok , look , ellie won' t admit it , but ever since the other night things have been different ,
we' re different , what night # what are you talking about ?
didn' t ellie tell you ?
no , tell me what ?
we were in a wreck in the canyon , a girl was killed , she was ripped apart ,
by .. ,
i don' t know , by some kind of animal ,
whatever it was bit me and now things have been happening to me ,
things i can' t explain , jake , i know it sounds crazy , nut i think it was a .. , a werewolf ,
hm ,
what does your sister say about all this ?
you know ellie ,
deny and avoid , it' s her thing , but it got her too and now i think we' re cursed ,
look , i almost took a guy' s head off in gym ,
i' m not the kind of guy to take another guy' s head off , i mean , look at me ,
what if it comes back ?
i mean , i know enough to know that it' s a who , not a what , so it could be pissed off ,
it may want to finish what it started ,
jimmy , i think you just need to calm down ,
i think the best thing we can do is just call your sister , get her down here and maybe the three of us should just sit down and discuss it ,
i don' t want to discuss this , i' ve been cursed , something bad is gonna happen ,
i can .. , look , i can feel it ,
jimmy , listen to yourself ,
werewolves ?
this was a mistake , sorry i bothered you , jimmy ,
no , no , thanks ,
jesus christ ,
bo , what are you doing here ?
i just wanted to , kind of , talk ,
about that stuff you said today ,
what stuff ?
about me , i was just wondering how you knew ,
no one else did , just you ,
and i' ve been so shitty to you , and then i thought , why wouldn' t you know ?
it takes one to know one , right ?
of course , you would know , know what ?
whoa , whoa , what are you doing ?
i' m gay ,
i just can' t keep it in anymore , i had to tell you , you' re the only other gay guy i know ,
whoa , ok , stop , no , i' m not gay , not that there' s anything wrong with it ,
this is hard for me , don' t be like this , trust me , bo , i' m not gay , i' m cursed ,
i know , sure feels like that , doesn' t it ?
not being able to tell anyone ,
talk to anyone about it , no , i' m cursed by the mark of the beast ,
bo ,
i' m a werewolf ,
come on , jimmy , you don' t have to pretend anymore , not with me ,
no , it' s part of the curse , i' m appealing , i have an unnatural sexual allure ,
yeah , yeah , you do , i know ,
look , dude , i' m happy for you , you be gay , it' s a good thing ,

no , they' re not here ,
weren' t there three ?
what ?
there' s three microphones , there' s only two .. ,
jimmy !
showtime , lsn' t that what they say ?
joannie ,
just for the record , i didn' t ask for this ,
it was just a hot night with the guy that every girl in town wanted ,
lucky me , i should' ve been more careful though ,
i got a little rough in bed and wound up cursed by the mark of the fucking beast ,
that jake , he' s a catch , oh , my god ,
i thought he was the one , you know , but all i got was a couple of dates , some hot sex , and a ' i' m not ready for a relationship right now , it' s not you , it' s me , '
men , they' re all beasts ,
jake didn' t want me , and if i can' t have him .. ,
well , you know how that line goes , hey , l .. ,
the funny thing is , i never saw you as a threat ,
i find you rather depressing myself ,
why do men always go for the tortured ones # poor damaged ellie ,
fuck you , bitch !
who' s lost it now ?
ok , just the two of us , fair fight , ok ?
just me and you , all right # come on ,
ok , i' m right here ,
ok , let' s go ,
fair fight ?
this is hollywood ,
and you .. ,
you get one taste of blood and you freak out ,
jimmy , jimmy ,
come on , run ,
jake # you bounce back quickly ,
hi ,
it' s you ?
yeah ,
how did this happen , joannie ?
well ,
i guess there' s no such thing as safe sex with a werewolf ,
joannie , it doesn' t have to be like this for you , there are ways for you to control it ,
like what # nibbling on coyotes in the desert # no thanks ,
i' m having too much fun eliminating the competition ,
pretty soon i' il have you all to myself ,
i won' t let you kill her , joannie ,
jake !
honey , muffin ,
i am not gonna kill her , i promise ,
i' m just gonna rip her to shreds and let her choke on her own blood ,
then .. , maybe i' il eat her ,
you have to kill me first ,
you' d like that , wouldn' t you ?
well , i' ve learned a few things about this curse along the way , and i know better ,
but that doesn' t mean i can' t make it hurt a little ,
i don' t see her , sh ,
ellie ?
let' s see how she deals with these ,
i' m gonna get you ,
where are you , you bitch ?
get this off !
where' s your brother ?
where' d she go ?
i don' t know ,
well , maybe she left ,
or maybe not ,
did she see us ?
i don' t think .. ,
run !
jimmy , get out of here ,
jimmy !
ellie ,
ellie , wake up ,
wake up ,
you' re playing with us , aren' t you , joannie ?
ellie ,
well , play this !
let' s go !
let' s go !
move along , let' s go , yes , sir , shit !
move it ,
freeze ! , don' t shoot ,
where' s the animal ?
it' s up there somewhere ,
what' s it supposed to be ?
i don' t know , stay alert , guys ,
what the hell is it , anyway ?
oh , it' s a werewolf , what ?
did you say werewolf ?
yeah , she may have changed back to her human form ,
her name is joannie , she' s this hyper , skinny publicist ,
any other description ?
yeah , she' s , what # like , five foot seven ? she' s got a bony ass , and fat thighs , and bad skin , liar !
shoot !
hold your fire !
hold your fire !
man , that' s ugly , careful ,
it' s dead , all clear ,
that' s fucked up , yeah , ok ,
stand down , what is this thing ?
i told you , it' s a werewolf , you have to separate the head from the ..
repeat , all clear ,
call animal control ,
get them out of here ,  is she dead ?
yeah , her brain' s on the floor , that should do it ,
jake , bo ,
hey , i need a paramedic in here ,
bo , bo , bo ,
yeah , are you ok ?
hey , jimbo , how' d i do ?
you did good ,
i' m gonna go look for jake , ok ?
yeah ,
hey , you good ?
yeah , he sucker punched me , i was about to kick his ass ,
ok ,
did you find him ?
no ,
i' m telling you , we shot the shit out of this , really ?
you' re gonna need a forklift , this thing is .. , huge ,
i think we can handle it ,
it looked a little bigger before ,
oh , shit !
are you ok ?
are you all right ?
i think so , yeah ,
so , it' s over , right ?
and joannie' s dead , so we' re ok now ..
well , that' s subjective , we still have to go back to our pathetic precurse lives ,
i' m personally ok with that , well , you' re not in high school ,
what happened ?
zipper ,
are you ok ?
i will be ,
what' s wrong ?
are you worried about jake ?
his secret' s out , he had to disappear , i don' t want to talk about it , ok ?
i know you think he' s a good guy , ellie , but don' t forget , all of this , everything we' ve been through , is because of him ,
when it comes down to it , a monster is still a monster ,
jimmy , that' s enough ,
i guess some things never change ,
do you think you can get us some light ?
yeah , yeah , i' il check the circuit breaker ,
zipper ?
how are you doing with those lights ?
yeah , one second , shit ,
is everything ok down there ?
yeah , it' s fine , i just .. ,
thank you ,
zipper ?
it' s ok , it' s just me , sorry , i' m still working on the fuses , it' s a little dark in here , i' il be up in a minute ,
jake ,
how are you , ellie ?
jake , something' s wrong , i' m .. ,
sh ,
it' il be ok , just breathe , you' il be ok ,
what' s happening to me ?
it' s starting , ellie ,
it' s almost midnight , oh , no ,
no ,
this can' t happen , jake , ellie ,
ellie , sh , it' s ok , you' re gonna be ok ,
i came back for you , i have to stop it ,
you have to help me stop it , ellie , it' s not really that simple ,
but you have nothing to worry about , this is how we can be together ,
you need this , ellie ,
you need me ,
you said it could be controlled , you don' t have to worry ,
i can teach you how to live with this , and we have years to figure it out , so that' s your answer ?
we live happily ever after ?
there' s no reason why we can' t now ,
think about it , your parents are dead , your brother is miserable , your life is a mess ,
why do you think it is that you fell for me so hard and so fast ?
i gave you a reason to live again , ellie , and i can still do that for you ,
jake , i don' t want this , it' s the only way we can be together , ellie ,
but i don' t want you , tell me how to get rid of it , tell me how !
the only way you can break the curse is for the one who started it all to die ,
and that s me .
i' m not ready to die just yet , i can' t let my brother live like this ,
you know i have to think of him first ,
i know , i bet you promised your parents that you' d give him a good life , didn' t you ?
but you know what , ellie # you' re really not doing a very good job , are you ?
in fact , you' re kind of a disaster , get away from me ,
i don' t want you to worry about your brother , ok ?
after all , there' s only room for one alpha male ,
and i really think we should put the poor kid out of his misery , don' t you ?
where is that brother of yours , anyway ?
now , where could he be ?
in the basement ?
these heightened senses are a kick , huh ?
no hard feelings , buddy ,
i' il make it as quick as possible ,
take it easy with the silver , ellie , you' re a monster ,
join the club ,
that' s only the beginning , ellie ,
i should' ve known you couldn' t handle this ,
you' re too weak to think you could survive it , it only makes you stronger ,
but you' re too stupid , too timid ,
it comes and goes at first ,
i probably should' ve told you that ,
unfortunately now you both have to die , hey !
you' d better run , you little shit ,
i am going to kill you ,
like you said , what doesn' t kill you .. ,
it' s over ,
are you sure # you were a little off on that whole ' how to break the curse ' thing ,
yeah , well , the books kind of glossed over that part ,
uh huh ,
we' re going to be ok ,
zipper ,
brooke ,
what are you doing here ?
hey , jimmy ,
i found your dog , he was wandering the streets ,
how' d you know where i lived ?
i told her ,
are you ok ?
yeah , you ?
i' m good , thanks ,
uh .. ,
can i walk you home ? sure ,
are you coming ?
yeah , see you later ,
nice moves , it' s the new me ,
i' m just gonna stay here , and , uh .. , clean ,
come on , zipper ,
