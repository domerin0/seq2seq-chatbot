help !
cigarette .
light .
i don' t believe the dream i just had .
i was in a forest running barefoot .
i was hurt , and i was being followed by somebody .
the more i ran the more i felt him coming closer .
who was the guy stalking you ?
it wasn' t a guy .
it was me .
that' s the weirdest part .
it was me running after me .
can' t you have normal dreams like everyone else ?
no .
being like everyone else is an awful bore !
we shouldn' t have gone out last night .
i' m exhausted .
take a rest .
i' il wake you when we get there .
yeah , very funny !
i' il drive , if you like .
y' mean like last time ?
oh come on .
it was late , and i felt tired .
felt tired , huh ?
you were dead drunk !
well , it was your fault for dumping me for three hours and disappearing with god knows who !
i hope at least that he was worth it .
i' il say !
unbelievable !
you' re really a bitch .
bastard !
maneater !
badlay !
anybody' s !
cheap hooker !
are there any cool places to go in the country ?
well , there' s a town hall but that' s about it .
wow , if i had to live here all year round i think i' d shoot myself ..
it' s another kind of rhythm .
it' s different .
besides , we didn' t come here to go partying .
we' re here to study ...
hey , we' re not deaf !
chill out marie !
c' mon hendrix , run !
bang !
bang !
bang !
tom , stop shouting for a minute .
you' re giving me a headache !
how long do we have to wait for alex , huh ?
she' il be here after you' ve had your bath .
no , because alex has never seen this cowboy suit .
tom , go and have your bath and then you can put your cowboy suit back on again .
okay ?
bang , bang , bang !
come on , hendrix , bang , bang !
good ... more ... more ...
watch the road !
you' ve still got some make up on , y' know .
are you sure it' s this way ?
of course i' m sure . in fifty meters , you go right at the corn field there it is .
turn right and then go straight for four kilometers .
you really know your way around .
nobody takes this road except for tractors .
four kilometers of this and it' s good bye car .
you can' t act that way whenever a guy tries to talk to you .
i don' t act that way with everyone .
come off it , marie .
it' s always the same story .
stop !
what' s wrong ?
i saw someone !
hey , that' s not funny , alex !
no , i' m not kidding .
i saw someone .
i swear .
stop screwing around like that will you !
alex , come back here , please !
damn it !
alex !
if this is a joke i' il make you regret it !
alex , where are you ?
where are you ?
i' il get you .
if you think you' re being funny you' ve got another thing coming !
alex ?
alex !
stop , you bitch , and come back !
i' m sick of your little game !
enough is enough !
god damn you !
what if i had left you out here ?
yeah , very funny !
you scared the hell out of me !
here we are .
okay , now i know why you passed your exams so easily .
if you spend all weekends up here , there' s not much else to do except study !
y' can' t beat it for peace and quiet .
you can hear the train go by but that' s it .
easy hendrix , easy .
how are you ?
hello dad .
don' t worry .
he doesn' t bite .
you talking about me or the dog ?
marie , this is my father .
pop , marie .
nice to meet you .
so , i finally see you in person and not just in a photo .
photo ?
you know , the one i took in spain .
yes , it' s on the fireplace .
you were living here .
and this is tom .
hi cowboy .
hey , are you happy to see me , partner ?
of course , he' s happy .
he has been waiting for you all this evening .
and your mother' s been worrying all day .
it' s okay , .
mom always worries for nothing .
i think she left you something in the oven .
but i told her we' d manage and not to bother .
she didn' t know if you' d have time to eat on the way .
that' s mom !
i' il put tom thumb to bed and show marie her room .
right .
i' il leave you then .
i have some work to finish .
g' night .
sleep well .
see you tomorrow .
good night, sir .
sleep tight .
did your dad build this place ?
it was an old farm that he renovated .
there are lots of them in the region .
most of them are ruins .
it' s a pity .
they' ve lived here for five years now .
did they have problems with the neighbors ?
with the local yokels ?
at first , they took my folks for a couple of hippies who came to make goat cheese , but now it' s fine .
well , that' s my room .
there .
this way now .
my parents ' room' s on the right .
tom' s room is there .
yours is upstairs , guest room .
just two seconds .
i' il put him to bed first .
alexia , is that you ?
that' s my mother .
go on .
i' il be right up .
hi mom .
is your friend all settled in ?
show her where the blankets are .
if she needs towels there are clean ones in the closet .
your own private bathroom .
great , huh ?
the heating' s electric .
should i turn it on ?
no , i can do it if i get cold .
well , what do you think ?
it' s like a doll' s house ... very pretty .
the problem is he' s got a girlfriend he doesn' t seem to want to split up with .
why' re you so interested then ?
someone who' s taken can' t be all that bad .
i' m always suspicious of guys who are free .
here .
want some more ?
no thanks .
well , i think it' s too easy to be a womanizer when you' re already taken .
maybe i' m just trying to convince myself ...
maybe he doesn' t like me at all .
what' s his girlfriend like ?
she' s brazilian .
they' ve been together three months .
what' s he doing with a brazilian ? is that his way of getting cheap thrills ?
anyway , i' ve gotta get a suntan fast ... and firm up my ass a little too .
you should see the way she' s built !
if you do salsa i' il go with you .
don' t get them excited or they' il keep us up all night !
hey , what about you ?
when are you gonna finally try yourluck ?
don' t start with that .
you' re gonna end up an old maid , marie .
i' m not hot to trot like you !
no , you' re scared , that' s all !
enough .
i' m gonna have a smoke outside .
how about you ?
no , i' m going to bed .
i' m wiped out .
don' t stay up too late .
i' il wake you at nine .
what' s the game plan ?
we' il start with international law .
okay ?
okay .
