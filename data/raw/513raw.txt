lock onto them , artoo .
master , general grievous' s ship is directly ahead .
the one crawling with vulture droids .
oh .
i see it .
oh , this is going to be easy .
odd ball , do you copy ?
copy , red leader .
mark my position and form your squad up behind me ...
we' re on your tail , general kenobi .
set s foils in attack position .
this is where the fun begins .
let them pass between us .
there are too many of them .
ire por mault
no , no !
they are doing their job so we can do ours .
missiles !
pull up !
they overshot us ...
they' re coming around !
all right , arfour .
no , no .
nothing too fancy .
surge all power units .
artoo !
stand by the reverse thrusters .
we got ' em .
artoo !
flying is for droids .
i' m hit !
anakin ?
i see them ...
buzz droids .
arfour , be careful .
you have one ...
oh dear .
they' re shutting down all the controls .
move to the right so i can get a clear shot at them .
the mission .
get to the command ship .
get the chancellor !
i' m running out of tricks here .
in the name of ...
hold your fire !
you' re not helping here .
i agree , bad idea .
i can' t see a thing !
my cockpit' s fogging .
they' re all over me , anakin .
move to the right .
hold on , anakin .
you' re going to get us both killed !
get out of here .
there' s nothing more you can do .
i' m not leaving without you , master .
get ' em , artoo .
watch out !
artoo , hit the buzz droid' s center eye .
yeah , you got him !
great , artoo .
the general' s command ship is dead ahead .
have you noticed the shields are still up ?
oh ? ! ?
sorry , master .
oh , i have a bad feeling about this .
artoo , locate the chancellor .
the chancellor' s signal is coming from right there .
the observation platform at the top of that spire .
i sense count dooku ...
i sense a trap .
next move ?
spring the trap .
artoo , go back .
i need you to stay with the ship .
here , take this , and wait for orders .
what' s the situation , captain ?
two jedi have landed in the main hangar bay .
los estamos rastreando
just as count dooku predicted .
destroyers !!
drop your weapons !
i said drop ' em .
those' re jedi fighters , all right .
did you press the stop button ?
no , did you ?
no !
well , there' s more than one way out of here .
we don' t want to get out , we want to get moving .
artoo ...
activate elevator 31174
what' s that ?
artoo .
do you copy ?
artoo .
activate the elevator number ... 31174
get back to work .
it' s nothing .
always on the move .
artoo , switch on the comlink .
stop , stop !
artoo , we need to be going up .
hands up , jedi !
artoo .
do you copy ?
artoo , do you hear me ?
artoo , we need to be going up , not down .
hey you !
now , that' s better ...
you stupid little astro droid !
oh , it' s you ...
what was that all about ?
well , artoo has been ...
no loose wire jokes ...
did i say anything ?
he' s trying !
i didn' t say anything !
chancellor .
are you all right ?
count dooku .
this time we will do it together .
i was about to say that .
get help !
you' re no match for him .
he' s a sith lord .
chancellor palpatine , sith lords are our specialty .
your swords , please .
we don' t want to make a mess of things in front of the chancellor .
you won' t get away this time , dooku .
i' ve been looking forward to this .
my powers have doubled since the last time we met , count .
good .
twice the pride , double the fall .
i sense great fear in you , skywalker .
you have hate , you have anger , but you don t use them .
good , anakin , good .
kill him .
kill him now !
i shouldn' t ...
do it !!
you did well , anakin .
he was too dangerous to be kept alive .
yes , but he was an unarmed prisoner .
i shouldn' t have done that .
it' s not the jedi way .
it is only natural .
he cut off your arm , and you wanted revenge .
it wasn' t the first time , anakin .
remember what you told me about your mother and the sand people .
now , we must leave before more security droids arrive .
anakin , there is no time .
we must get off the ship before it' s too late .
he seems to be all right .
leave him , or we' il never make it .
his fate will be the same as ours .
prepare for attack .
all batteries fire !
fire !
the elevator' s not working ,
artoo .
activate elevator 3224 .
reverse stabilizers .
magnetize !
magnetize !
fire the emergency booster engines .
leveling out , sir .
easy ...
we' re in a bit of a situation .
did i miss something ?
hold on .
what is that ?
artoo , artoo , shut down the elevator !
too late !
jump !
let' s see if we can find something in the hangar bay that' s still flyable .
artoo , get down here .
artoo , do you copy ?
general , we found the jedi .
they' re in hallway 328 .
activate ray shields .
ray shields !
wait a minute , how' d this happen !
we' re smarter than this .
apparently not .
i say ... patience .
patience !
yes , artoo will be along in a few moments and he' il release the ray shields .
see !
no problem .
don' t move !
do you have a plan b ?
oh yes .
the negotiator .
general kenobi .
we' ve been waiting for you .
that wasn' t much of a rescue .
you' re welcome .
and anakin skywalker ...
i was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older .
general grievous .
you' re shorter than i expected .
jedi scum ...
we have a job to do , anakin .
try not to upset him .
your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection .
not this time .
and this time you won' t escape .
artoo .
crush them !
make them suffer !
stay and watch your stations .
don' t bother with them .
keep the ship in orbit .
you lose , general kenobi .
time to abandon ship .
all the escape pods have been launched .
grievous .
can you fly a cruiser like this ?
you mean , do i know how to land what' s left of this thing ?
well ?
under the circumstances , i' d say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant .
strap yourselves in .
open all hatches , extend all flaps , and drag fins .
we lost something .
not to worry , we' re still flying half the ship .
now we' re really picking up speed ...
eight plus sixty .
we' re in the atmosphere .
grab that ...
keep us level .
steady .
easy , artoo .
five thousand ...
fireships on the left and the right .
we' il take you in .
copy that .
landing strip' s straight ahead .
we' re coming in too hot .
another happy landing .
are you coming , master ?
oh no .
i' m not brave enough for politics .
i have to report to the council .
besides , someone needs to be the poster boy .
hold on , this whole operation was your idea .
let us not forget anakin that you rescued me from the buzz droids .
and you killed count dooku .
and you rescued the chancellor , carrying me unconscious on your back ,
all because of your training , master .
anakin , let' s be fair .
today , you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians .
all right .
but you owe me ... and not for saving your skin for the tenth time .
ninth time ... that business on cato nemoidia doesn' t count .
i' il see you at the briefing .
chancellor palpatine , are you all right ?
yes , thanks to your two jedi knights .
they killed count dooku , but general grievous has escaped once again .
general grievous will run and hide as he always does .
he is a coward . but with count dooku dead , he is the leader of the droid army , and i assure you , the senate will vote to continue the war as long as grievous is alive .
then the jedi council will make finding grievous our highest priority .
the republic cannot praise you enough .
thank you , senator organa .
well , it couldn' t possibly be as bad as all that .
well , there , i agree with you .
in fact , i could do with a tune up myself . but the fighting is going to continue until general grievous is spare parts ...
well , i' il do everything i can with the senate .
excuse me .
certainly .
oh , anakin !
i missed you , padme .
there were whispers ... that you' d been killed .
i' m all right .
it feels like we' ve been apart for a lifetime .
and it might have been ...
if the chancellor hadn' t been kidnapped .
i don' t think they would have ever brought us back from the outer rim sieges .
wait , not here ...
yes , here !
i' m tired of all this deception .
i don' t care if they know we' re married .
anakin , don' t say things like that .
are you all right ?
you' re trembling .
what' s going on ?
something wonderful has happened .
annie , i' m pregnant .
that' s ...
that' s wonderful .
what are we going to do ?
we' re not going to worry about anything right now , all right ?
this is a happy moment .
the happiest moment of my life .
yes , lord sidious .
general grievous ,
i suggest you move the separatist leaders to mustafar .
it will be done , my lord .
the end of the war is near , general .
but the loss of count dooku ?
his death was a necessary loss .
soon i will have a new apprentice ... one far younger and more powerful .
annie , i want to have our baby back home on naboo .
we could go to the lake country where no one would know where we would be safe .
i could go early and fix up the baby' s room .
i know the perfect spot , right by the gardens .
you are so beautiful !
it' s only because i' m so in love ...
no , it' s because i' m so in love with you .
so love has blinded you ?
well , that' s not exactly what i meant ...
but it' s probably true !
anakin , help me !
what' s bothering you ?
nothing ...
i remember when i gave this to you .
how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other ?
it was a dream .
bad ?
like the ones i used to have about my mother just before she died .
and ?
it was about you .
tell me .
it was only a dream .
you die in childbirth ...
and the baby ?
i don' t know .
it was only a dream .
i won' t let this one become real .
this baby will change our lives .
i doubt the queen will continue to allow me to serve in the senate , and if the council discovers you are the father , you will be expelled ...
i know ...
i know .
do you think obi wan might be able to help us ?
i don' t need his help ...
our baby is a blessing .
premonitions ? premonitions ...
hmmmm ... these visions you have ...
they are of pain , suffering , death ...
yourself you speak of , or someone you know ?
someone ... close to you ?
yes .
yourself you speak of , or someone you know ?
someone ... close to you ?
yes .
careful you must be when sensing the future , anakin .
the fear of loss is a path to the dark side .
i won' t let these visions come true , master yoda .
death is a natural part of life .
rejoice for those around you who transform into the force .
mourn them , do not .
miss them , do not .
attachment leads to jealousy .
the shadow of greed , that is .
what must i do , master yoda ?
train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose .
you missed the report on the outer rim sieges .
i' m sorry , i was held up .
i have no excuse .
in short , they are going very well .
saleucami has fallen , and master vos has moved his troops to boz pity .
what' s wrong then ?
the senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the chancellor today .
well , that can only mean less deliberating and more action .
is that bad ?
it will make it easier for us to end this war .
be careful of your friend palpatine .
be careful of what ?
he has requested your presence .
what for ?
he would not say .
he didn' t inform the jedi council ?
that' s unusual , isn' t it ?
all of this is unusual , and it' s making me feel uneasy .
i hope you trust me , anakin .
of course .
i need your help , son .
what do you mean ?
i' m depending on you .
for what ?
i don' t understand .
to be the eyes , ears , and voice of the republic ...
anakin ...
i' m appointing you to be my personal representative on the jedi council .
me ?
a master ?
i am overwhelmed , sir , but the council elects its own members .
they will never accept this .
i think they will ... they need you more than you know .
allow this appointment lightly , the council does not .
disturbing is this move by chancellor palpatine .
i understand .
you are on this council , but we do not grant you the rank of master .
what ? !
how can you do this ??
this is outrageous , it' s unfair ...
how can you be on the council and not be a master ?
take a seat , young skywalker .
forgive me , master .
we have surveyed all systems in the republic , and have found no sign of general grievous .
hiding in the outer rim , grievous is .
the outlying systems , you must sweep . we do not have many ships to spare .
what about the droid attack on the wookiees ?
it is critical we send an attack group there , immediately !
he' s right , that is a system we cannot afford to lose .
go , i will .
good relations with the wookiees , i have .
it is settled then .
yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the wookiees on kashyyyk .
may the force be with us all .
what kind of nonsense is this , put me on the council and not make me a master ! ??
that' s never been done in the history of the jedi .
it' s insulting !
calm down , anakin .
you have been given a great honor .
to be on the council at your age .
it' s never happened before .
the fact of the matter is you' re too close to the chancellor .
the council doesn' t like it when he interferes in jedi affairs .
i swear to you , i didn' t ask to be put on the council ...
but it' s what you wanted !
your friendship with chancellor palpatine seems to have paid off .
that has nothing to do with this .
the only reason the council has approved your appointment is because the chancellor trusts you .
and ?
anakin , i am on your side .
i didn' t want to put you in this situation .
what situation ?
the council wants you to report on all of the chancellor' s dealings .
they want to know what he' s up to .
they want me to spy on the chancellor ?
that' s treason !
we are at war , anakin .
why didn' t the council give me this assignment when we were in session ?
this assignment is not to be on record .
the chancellor is not a bad man , obi wan .
he befriended me .
he' s watched out for me ever since i arrived here .
that is why you must help us , anakin .
anakin .
our allegiance is to the senate , not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired . the senate demanded that he stay longer .
yes , but use your feelings , anakin .
something is out of place .
you' re asking me to do something against the jedi code .
against the republic .
against a mentor ... and a friend .
that' s what' s out of place here .
why are you asking this of me ?
the council is asking you .
anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm .
it' s very dangerous , putting them together .
i don' t think the boy can handle it .
i don' t trust him .
with all due respect , master , is he not the chosen one ?
is he not to destroy the sith and bring balance to the force ?
so the prophecy says .
a prophecy ... that misread could have been .
he will not let me down .
he never has .
i hope right you are .
sometimes , i wonder what' s happening to the jedi order ...
i think this war is destroying the principles of the republic .
have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side ?
what do you mean ?
what if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists , and the republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy ?
i don' t believe that .
and you' re sounding like a separatist !
this war represents a failure to listen .
now , you' re closer to the chancellor than anyone . please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume .
don' t ask me to do that .
make a motion in the senate , where that kind of a request belongs .
what is it ?
nothing .
don' t do this ... don' t shut me out .
let me help you .
hold me ...
like you did by the lake on naboo , so long ago ... when there was nothing but our love ...
no politics , no plotting ... no war .
you wanted to see me , chancellor .
yes , anakin !
come closer .
i have good news .
our clone intelligence units have discovered the location of general grievous .
he is hiding in the utapau system .
at last , we' il be able to capture that monster and end this war .
i would worry about the collective wisdom of the council if they didn' t select you for this assignment .
you are the best choice ... by far
sit down .
leave us .
anakin , you know i' m not able to rely on the jedi council .
if they haven' t included you in their plot , they soon will .
i' m not sure i understand .
you must sense what i have come to suspect ... the jedi council want control of the republic ... they' re planning to betray me .
i don' t think ...
anakin , search your feelings .
you know , don' t you ?
i know they don' t trust you ...
or the senate ... or the republic ... or democracy for that matter .
i have to admit my trust in them has been shaken .
why ?
they asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest , didn' t they ?
they asked you to spy on me , didn' t they ?
i don' t know ...
i don' t know what to say .
remember back to your early teachings .
all those who gain power are afraid to lose it .
even the jedi .
the jedi use their power for good .
good is a point of view , anakin .
the sith and the jedi are similar in almost every way , including their quest for greater power .
the sith rely on their passion for their strength .
they think inward , only about themselves .
and the jedi don' t ?
the jedi are selfless ...
they only care about others .
did you ever hear the tragedy of darth plagueis " the wise " ?
no .
i thought not .
it' s not a story the jedi would tell you .
it' s a sith legend .
darth plagueis was a dark lord of the sith , so powerful and so wise he could use the force to influence the midi chlorians to create life ...
he had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying .
he could actually save people from death ?
the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural .
what happened to him ?
he became so powerful ... the only thing he was afraid of was
losing his power , which eventually , of course , he did .
unfortunately , he taught his apprentice everything he knew , then his apprentice killed him in his sleep .
it' s ironic ... he could save others from death , but not himself .
is it possible to learn this power ?
not from a jedi .
palpatine thinks general grievous is on utapau .
a partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the chairman of utapau .
act on this , we must .
the capture of general grievous will end this war .
quickly and decisively we should proceed .
the chancellor has requested that i lead the campaign .
the council will make up its own mind who is to go , not the chancellor .
a master is needed , with more experience .
i concur .
master kenobi should go .
i agree .
i.
i.
very well .
council is adjourned .
the droids have started up their main power generators .
then now the time is , commander .
yes , sir .
you' re going to need me on this one , master .
oh , i agree .
however it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase .
master !
i' ve disappointed you .
i have not been very appreciative of your training ...
i have been arrogant ... and i apologize ...
i' ve just been so frustrated with the council .
you are strong and wise , anakin , and i am very proud of you .
i have trained you since you were a small boy .
i have taught you everything i know .
and you have become a far greater jedi than i could ever hope to be .
but be patient , anakin .
it won' t be long before the council makes you a jedi master .
obi wan , may the force be with you .
good bye , old friend .
may the force be with you .
fortunately , most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here ... on the far side .
i' il keep them distracted until you get there .
just don' t take too long .
come on , when have i ever let you down ?
very well , the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you' il arrive .
save your energy .
i can' t !
don' t give up , padme .
obi wan' s been here , hasn' t he ?
he came by this morning .
what did he want ?
he' s worried about you .
he says you' re under a lot of stress .
i feel ... lost .
lost ?
what do you mean ?
obi wan and the council don' t trust me .
they trust you with their lives .
something' s happening ...
i' m not the jedi i should be .
i want more , and i know i shouldn' t .
you expect too much of yourself .
i have found a way to save you .
save me ?
from my nightmares .
is that what' s bothering you ?
i won' t lose you , padme .
i' m not going to die in childbirth , annie .
i promise you .
no , i prom ise you !
greetings , young jedi .
what brings you to our remote sanctuary ?
unfortunately , the war .
there is no war here unless you' ve brought it with you .
with your kind permission , i should like some fuel and to use your city as a base as i search nearby systems for general grievous .
he is here !
we are being held hostage .
they are watching us .
i understand .
the tenth level ... thousands of battle droids ...
tell your people to take shelter .
if you have warriors , now is the time .
take the fighter back to the ship .
tell cody , i' ve made contact .
va a traer mas guerreros ?
he didn' t say .
it won' t be long before the armies of the republic track us here .
i am sending you to the mustafar system in the outer rim .
it is a volcanic planet
you will be safe there .
safe ?
chancellor palpatine managed to escape your grip , general , without count dooku .
i have doubts about your ability to keep us safe .
be thankful , viceroy , you have not found yourself in my grip .
your ship is waiting .
hello , there !
general kenobi ,
you are a bold one .
kill him !
back away .
i will deal with this jedi slime myself .
your move .
you fool .
i have been trained in your jedi arts by count dooku .
attack , kenobi .
army or not , you must realize you are doomed .
oh !
i don' t think so .
master windu , may i interrupt ?
general kenobi has made contact with general grievous , and we have begun our attack .
thank you , commander .
anakin , deliver this report to the chancellor .
his reaction will give us a clue to his intentions .
yes , master .
i sense a plot to destroy the jedi .
the dark side of the force surrounds the chancellor .
if he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of grievous , then he should be removed from office .
the jedi council would have to take control of the senate in order to secure a peaceful transition ...
to a dark place this line of thought will carry us .
hmmmmm ... great care we must take .
chancellor , we have just received a report from master kenobi .
he has engaged general grievous .
we can only hope that master kenobi is up to the challenge .
i should be there with him .
it is upsetting to me to see that the council doesn' t seem to fully appreciate your talents .
don' t you wonder why they won' t make you a jedi master ?
i wish i knew .
more and more i get the feeling that i am being excluded from the council .
i know there are things about the force that they are not telling me .
they don' t trust you , anakin .
they see your future .
they know your power will be too strong to control .
you must break through the fog of lies the jedi have created around you .
let me help you to know the subtleties of the force .
how do you know the ways of the force ?
my mentor taught me everything about the force ... even the nature of the dark side .
you know the dark side ? !
anakin , if one is to understand the great mystery , one must study all its aspects , not just the dogmatic , narrow view of the jedi .
if you wish to become a complete and wise leader , you must embrace a larger view of the force .
be careful of the jedi , anakin .
only through me can you achieve a power greater than any jedi .
learn to know the dark side of the force ,
anakin , and you will be able to save your wife from certain death .
what did you say ?
use my knowledge , i beg you ...
you' re a sith lord !
i know what has been troubling you ...
listen to me .
don' t continue to be a pawn of the jedi council !
ever since i' ve known you , you' ve been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary jedi ... a life of significance , of conscience .
are you going to kill me ?
i would certainly like to .
i know you would .
i can feel your anger .
it gives you focus , makes you stronger .
i am going to turn you over to the jedi council .
of course you should .
but you' re not sure of their intentions , are you ?
i will quickly discover the truth of all this .
you have great wisdom , anakin .
know the power of the dark side .
the power to save padme .
so uncivilized ...
master windu ,
i must talk to you .
we have just received word that obi wan has destroyed general grievous .
we are on our way to make sure the chancellor returns emergency powers back to the senate .
he won' t give up his power .
i' ve just learned a terrible truth .
i think chancellor palpatine is a sith lord .
a sith lord ?
yes .
the one we have been looking for .
how do you know this ?
he knows the ways of the force .
he has been trained to use the dark side .
are you sure ?
absolutely .
then our worst fears have been realized .
we must move quickly if the jedi order is to survive .
master , the chancellor is very powerful .
you will need my help if you are going to arrest him .
for your own good , stay out of this affair .
i sense a great deal of confusion in you , young skywalker .
there is much fear that clouds your judgment .
i must go , master .
no .
if what you told me is true , you will have gained my trust , but for now remain here .
wait in the council chamber until we' il return .
yes , master .
