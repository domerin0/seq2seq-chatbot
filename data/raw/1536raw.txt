obi , we anchor here .
we stay here tonight , nardo .
we go to the black lagoon in the morning .
i fix you some supper now .
what are we having tonight ?
oh , big surprise .
what we didn' t finish last night .
what i' d give for a tall , cold beer .
or a short , warm blonde .
the gill man ; prehistoric monster .
maybe there' s no such thing .
you find him , mister .
i' il catch him .
it doesn' t look good for a conservative institution like ocean harbor ... to circus a yarn and then not to deliver .
if you' re smart , you won' t worry about it .
if there is a gill man , we' il catch him .
if it' s a phony , well , the boss is out his dough .
george .
hey , lucas .
yes , mr. johnson ?
ah , it' s a crocodile .
huh , you think maybe that is it ?
oh no , the thing you are looking for can break that in two .
you know , sometimes i think all north americanos are crazy .
if he is dead , you waste your money .
if he' s alive , maybe you be sorry you find him .
yeah ?
there isn' t a fish alive i can' t handle .
who says he' s a fish ?
what a character .
this sweatbox .
doesn' t it ever cool off here ?
never .
you want to go back ?
at your service .
not till we get the ... the whatever it is .
then we' il go back .
he won' t rest easy till he' s got it in the tank back at ocean harbor .
what for do you want to do this ?
so people can come and stare at the man fish ?
to please some crazy scientists ?
for this you' re going to risk your lives ?
who said anything about risking lives ?
it' s a job .
a technical job .
oh .
maybe then you got a book ... that going to tell you how to do this thing ?
now look , we' re not paying you to make jokes .
no joke .
tomorrow we gonna be in the lagoon .
you will go down in the water .
then is no longer time for talking , so maybe is better we talk now , huh ?
okay , go ahead .
last year i came to this place with a party of scientists .
also brave and highly technical people .
in the end , five persons were dead .
the gill man , still there .
were they equipped for the capture ?
no .
well , we are .
so , i like to ask you something .
i' m not very educated person .
this gill man , this thing i have seen with my eyes , it ... it doesn' t belong in our world .
it should' ve died out long before man was born .
still , it exists .
why ?
well , i' il try to explain it to you .
sometimes a species gets isolated in time .
if the conditions are right , it reproduces itself without change , skipping a chapter of evolution .
way back , there must have been some major link ... between marine and terrestrial life .
it' s just possible that this is it .
well , that' s all there is to it .
uh huh .
now i tell you what i believe .
this beast exists because it is stronger than ... than the thing that you call evolution .
in it is some force of life .
a demon ... driving it through millions of centuries .
it does not surrender so easily ... to weaklings like you and me .
this is the thing that you hunt for .
think on it .
good night , gentlemen .
well .
and that , kiddies , is our fairy story for tonight .
joe , maybe he' s right .
back in florida ...
you don' t suppose that they expect us ... to lose our lives over this thing ?
maybe we got no business to be here at all .
want to play some cards ?
no .
no , i think i' il try to get some sleep .
you better do the same .
oh , i' il sleep fine .
no imagination .
drop anchor .
yes , captain .
nardo , bring the net .
bring the net down .
lower .
good .
the americano does the rest .
you get that net secure , joe , and we got the entrance sealed off .
well , let' s go .
in a suit like that , he' il be helpless as a baby .
this baby was born in that suit .
he' s taken pretty good care of himself up to now .
now is different , my friend .
how are things ?
lucas isn' t getting you scared , is he ?
take me up , george . !
take me up . !
bring him in !
bring him in !
he' s in trouble .
the lines are fouled up .
joe !
joe , are you all right ?
joe !
is he gone ?
joe , can you hear me ?
hey , look .
he' s coming up .
keep bringing him in .
bring him in !
hurry up . !
he' s got the air hose .
get the rifle .
quick , shoot him .
shoot him .
bring him to the ladder .
help him up .
get him on deck .
oh , he' s hurt .
look at that suit .
it' s all slashed .
watch his feet , obi .
get him over there and sit him down .
quick as you can .
look , he' s bleeding badly .
i' il get this helmet plate off .
did you get him ?
i don' t know , but i' m glad he didn' t get you .
pull the pin , lucas .
si , i do it .
i hope you ain' t going to blow up my boat , mr. johnson .
like my wife , she' s not much , but she' s all i have .
don' t worry .
there' s just enough dynamite in these cans ... to stun anything below the surface .
if that thing' s alive , this oughta do the trick .
go on back to the rita .
all right .
uh , you do it easy , huh ?
you ready ?
here goes nothin ' .
well , no sign of him .
maybe this time we are lucky and he is dead , huh ?
there he is !
what' s this ?
where ?
by golly , you' re right .
there he is .
come on , lucas , let' s go get him .
always i have the bad luck .
be sure you tie him up good .
this is the first telephoto of the fantastic find received from rio dejaneiro .
the creature is in a coma .
has been ever since its capture in an isolated amazon lagoon .
right now it' s being flown to florida' s famed ocean harbor oceanarium ... where the experts hope to restore it to consciousness .
movement of the creature has required some split second timing .
it can exist out of water for only a few minutes at a stretch .
the capture of the gill man has created the greatest scientific stir ... since the explosion of the atomic bomb .
further information is anxiously awaited ... in colleges and universities throughout the world .
why , neal , that' s wonderful .
you have such a vibrant color sense for a four year old .
you know , i think this one is even good enough to show to your friends .
all right , lesson' s over .
now , turn around , neal .
turn around .
turn around .
sit down .
all right now .
open your mouth .
oh , that' s a boy .
all right now .
cover your eyes .
cover your eyes .
that' s a good boy .
now stand up .
stand up .
now put your arms over your head and stretch .
oh , what a good boy .
good morning , miss abbott .
good morning , dr. ferguson .
good morning , neal .
come over here and see me .
how' s he doing ?
just fine .
neal , what do you think of your work ?
flattery will get you nowhere .
it' s just amazing .
he' s really as bright as a child .
well , as bright as a two or three year old anyway .
well , that' s fine , but remember , we' re supposed to find out what the difference is between ... the intelligence of an ape and a human being .
and at the rate he' s going , sometimes i wonder if there is any difference .
doc , would you come here a minute ?
sure .
i' il take you now , my boy .
doc , didn' t you say that among the lower animals ... there were no natural enemies as long as they' re well fed ?
yeah , something like that .
well , maybe so , doc , but there were four rats in there when i changed my lights .
now there' s only three .
it' s my considered opinion that rat number four is sitting inside that cat .
are you sure you fed them all this morning ?
sure , i always feed them .
l ...
how' d he get in here ?
clete .
clete , here' s the most important news that ...
the greatest scientific find since the peking man .
what you got , mac , someone unearth a natural blonde ?
they' ve captured that devonian relic dr. reed reported last year .
you' re kidding .
know what i think ?
i think you should be thinking about going down to ocean harbor .
you wouldn' t have any trouble .
they know your work down there .
clete .
clete , you can be the first man to scientifically ... study a creature that , by all the laws of nature , should' ve died a quarter of a million years ago .
where are you going ?
to ask the dean for a leave of absence .
what else ?
joe , johnson .
how are you , lou , mr. foster ?
never better , joe .
the whole country is talking about that catch of yours .
that right ?
well , it oughta be worth a raise then .
it is .
what' s this i hear about you gettin ' mauled ?
ah , just a few scratches .
hey , we' il bring him right up .
well , let' s go down there , boys .
now keep him straight .
guide him in there easily .
watch his head that it doesn' t hit on that bulkhead .
all right .
move him through slowly .
lower itjust a little .
all right .
all right , take it away .
watch this railing here .
hold steady there .
that' s it .
okay , swing it in .
keep it comin ' , boys .
keep him comin ' .
right in here .
all set , george .
keep it comin ' .
raise it up a little .
up a little higher .
all right , hold it .
now down .
all right , hold it .
hold it .
that' s good .
afraid i' ve got some bad news for you , mr. foster .
the gill man ?
yeah .
been in a coma ever since we captured him .
but he' s still alive .
yeah , just about .
look , joe , you can' t do this to me .
i' ve got every man , woman and child in the civilized world waiting to meet the gill man .
the hotels are booked for 50 miles around here .
i' ve got the radio , the tv ...
louie , speeches aren' t gonna do any good now .
we' il put him in the receiving tank and we' il see what happens .
come on , let' s get rolling , mac .
okay , joe .
hold him level now .
i suppose we might describe this , ladies and gentlemen , as the creature' s official entry into the 20th century .
here at ocean harbor it will live , if it lives at all , and become the object of scientific study .
the question now is whether joe hayes , the man who captured the creature , will be able to bring it out of its comatose condition .
he' s waiting for it now .
alone in the tank .
apparently showing no sign of fear as his arms reach out .
easy now .
let it down easy .
i' ve got it .
all right , down just a little .
all right , hold it .
can you get him out , joe ?
yeah , i can make it .
okay , take it away .
take up the rig .
hey , boys , look up here .
man , look at that thing .
will he come out of it ?
too early to tell .
pardon me , sir .
miss dobson , may i have a word with you ?
ladies and gentlemen ,
i have here miss helen dobson .
one of the prettiest young ladies it' s ever been my pleasure to interview .
miss dobson was a science major at belmont university in texas and now ...
well , perhaps i' d better get her to explain it to you .
what brings you to the oceanarium , miss dobson ?
i' m here to gather material for my masters thesis .
i' m studying ichthyology .
ichthyology ?
that' s a ten dollar word .
how about explaining it to us ?
well , ichthyology is the study of fish .
i see .
i noticed that joe hayes out here ... has the gill man down in the water ... and he' s walking him around .
that seems to be a strange thing to do .
is there any particular reason for it ?
well , that' s the way they revive sharks and other large fish .
and since this creature has gills , they' re using the same method .
you see , walking forces water into the mouth ... from which it flows over the gills .
uh , as the water traverses past the gills , fine blood vessels , on the surface of the gills , release the carbon dioxide ... and pick up a dissolved oxygen from the water ... which exits from the fish through the gill slit .
i see .
well , do you think it will work in this particular case ?
well , i' m no prophet .
well , thank you very much for talking to us , miss dobson .
how does it look , joe ?
can' t tell yet , lou .
how long has he been walkin ' this thing ?
about two hours .
what a way to make a living .
his arm .
i saw it .
it did move .
watch it up there .
he' s starting to move .
why doesn' t he get out ?
get those ropes ready .
i want to get out of here as soon as i get a line on him .
we' re ready , joe .
get that camera here , quick !
he' il get out of the tank . !
keep that net handy .
i may need it .
we' il have it when you do .
all right , stand by with those boat hooks , boys .
that thing will kill somebody .
look out . !
joe , look , he' s climbing out .
look out , joe .
give me that .
be careful . !
joe . !
get him out of there . !
get the net ready . !
throw the net . !
throw the net . !
bring him over here , joe .
okay , i' ve got his wrist .
get those cuts fixed up right away .
all right , all right .
let' s get out ofhere before that thing breaks loose again .
ladies and gentlemen , our ocean harbor technicians ... are about to move the gill man from the receiving tank into the larger permanent tank .
mr. joe hayes is in charge of the operation .
open up the gate .
everything all right ?
wait till they' re all out of the tank .
i' m not taking any chances .
okay .
i hope that chain holds .
don' t worry about that chain .
welcome , ladies and gentlemen , to ocean harbor , on this , the first day of public exhibit of the world famous gill man .
we suggest that you enjoy all of the sights the oceanarium has to offer .
once you' ve seen the gill man , please move on .
give the other folks a chance .
our attendants will be pleased to answer your questions ... as you tour the wonders of the deep .
very shortly now the gill man will be fed .
scientists are still investigating his diet .
they found the creature reluctant to eat ... these fish that are swimming about him in the tank .
it was a real break finding you here .
look , i' m not one of those specialists ... who fails to appreciate the other fella' s field .
although , personally , i think we' re overspecialized .
why , it' s getting so we have experts ... who concentrate only on the lower section of a specimen' s left ear .
well , i must tell you , i know something about your work .
and i was quite impressed when i heard you were coming .
you' re not at all like i expected .
i' m glad i disappointed you .
he' s not much on table manners , is he ?
come on , let' s get out of here before the crowd runs over us .
all right .
what are you doing for dinner tonight ?
you don' t waste any time , do you ?
i' ve only got two weeks .
but you came here to work .
any time a man can combine business with pleasure , he' s batting 500 in my league .
and now , i' il start all over again .
miss dobson , what are you doing for dinner tonight ?
well , i hadn' t thought about it , sir .
then that' s settled .
now where are you staying ?
at the star motel .
great .
so am i.
hey , professor . !
wait for me !
uh oh , i' ve been afraid of this .
thatjoe hayes is an a number one wolf .
avoid him .
it' il be difficult , but it can be done .
well , aren' t you gonna wait for him ?
what ?
and let mr. america cut into my cake ?
what' s the matter , old timer , pooped out ?
you shouldn' t walk these brain boys so fast .
they can' t take it .
you know , strong upstairs , but no stamina .
it' s good to see you , clete .
i heard you were in town .
you too .
i understand you' re gonna be here for a couple of weeks .
yeah , that' s right .
ah , that' s tough .
you won' t have the chance to enjoy the good things in life .
and what are you doing for dinner tonight ?
well , i uh ...
uh , sorry , joe , she just made a date with me , didn' t you ?
well , i ...
well , yes .
oh , but you can join us , joe , if you want to .
no , thanks .
i' il give the professor his chance .
i don' t like to take advantage of amateurs .
see you later .
ladies and gentlemen , introducing flippy , the educated porpoise .
flippy has been taught to retrieve objects on command .
and now , for a finale , flippy will raise the flag .
well , where have you been , boy ?
i guess i better introduce you .
professor , this is chris .
my one true love and favorite boyfriend .
pleased to meet you , sir .
well , it' s all right , boy .
he won' t bite you .
ah , come on , boy .
say , you' re a good old dog .
does he always travel with you ?
no , no .
he picked me up a couple of weeks ago .
i was here watching the porpoises ... and he made a pass at me , didn' t you , boy ?
if flippy gets any smarter , he' il start talking .
he talks , all right .
we' re just not smart enough to understand him .
hi .
hi .
think chris is smarter than flippy , professor ?
i doubt it .
the porpoise has a very large and well developed brain .
in fact , his intelligence lies somewhere between a chimpanzee and a dog .
how smart is the gill man ?
well , that' s what i' m here to find out .
what his reflexes are like .
his behavior patterns .
his capacity to learn .
his response to stimuli .
oh , it sounds exciting .
i hope i' il be able to help .
thanks .
i' m sure you will .
here we go .
okay , once more .
back again .
all right , flippy , you may now return to your private quarters , and thank you .
testing .
one , two , three , four .
testing .
one , two , three , four .
testing .
one , two , three , four .
testing .
one , two , three , four .
testing .
one , two , three , four .
the speaker must be working .
he' s reacting to it down there .
be sure your throat mike is tight .
be sure and keep that volume up .
yes , sir .
now the important thing is not to become so interested you get careless .
oh , you don' t have to worry about that .
if anything goes wrong , you head straight for the surface , you understand ?
all right , let' s go .
i sure hate to use this , but i guess we haven' t much choice .
all right now , let' s go over it once more .
you' re to wait for the right moment ... and then push the food cage within his reach .
mm hmm .
as he reaches for it , you' re to say " stop " in your throat microphone .
he won' t know what it means ... so i' il condition him by shocking him with the bull prod .
right ?
right .
bob , hand me this when i get in the water , will you ?
here he comes .
be careful , clete .
that was lesson number one .
he knows the prod can hurt him .
put the cage down and stay close to the wall .
right .
he' s a little gun shy .
you better attract his attention .
jiggle the cover , helen .
okay .
get back , helen . !
here he comes .
now .
stop .
stop .
stop .
stop .
he' s learning fast .
shall we try it again ?
no , that' s enough for now .
let' s take the cage up .
from now on , we' re the only ones who' il feed him .
that was fine .
now you better get out of that rig .
remember , we have a date for dinner tonight .
hi .
i don' t care what the joke writers say .
it takes longer for a man to dress .
he' s got more to put on .
how' s he doin ' ?
fine .
come on , let' s get out of here .
all right .
here' s the mickey finn , professor .
good .
takes about five minutes for this stuff to work .
then he' il be gentle as a baby .
i suppose .
fine scientist you are , getting squeamish about doping a fish .
he' s got it .
let' s go .
right .
hey , what goes on here ?
oh , well ... every second , millions of electric impulses ...
leap from one cell of the brain to another ... making our minds and moods what they are .
you see , those wires on the gill man ... pick up these impulses and register them here on the chart .
yeah .
naturally , we' d learn a lot more about the creature ... if we could test him while he was awake .
well , my dear girl , everybody knows that when you' re asleep the brain stops working .
no more so than the heart does .
the brain waves become irregular , like those of the insane .
you mean , i' m crazy when i' m asleep ?
no more so than when you' re awake .
red corpuscle content only 10 percent less than human blood .
un nucleated structure .
no correlation with the fish sample .
it' s amazing .
every test , every reaction just misses being human .
back again , boy ?
say , you' re like a proverbial kid brother trying to mooch a nickel .
there .
well , what' s the matter , boy , you worn out ?
wouldn' t you be by now ?
here , boy .
fetch .
fetch it , boy .
fetch it .
he' s a character .
it' s nice to get away , lie in the sun , be like other people .
strange talk coming from a dedicated scientist .
have you forgotten your mission in life ?
i' il be leaving soon .
i' m gonna miss you .
you know , sometimes i wonder how i ever got started in all this .
science , fish , ichthyology .
where will it all lead me , as a person , i mean ?
most of the kids i went to undergraduate school with ... are already married and have children .
is that what you want ?
i don' t know .
l ...
i just don' t know .
but surely ...
but what do you want ?
well , it' s different with me .
i' m a man , i don' t have to make a choice .
but i do ?
it' s tough on you gals .
i' m not saying it' s right or wrong .
just a fact .
it doesn' t seem right .
but you haven' t told me what you want .
what you want most , i mean .
i' d like to know before i leave .
you' ve become important to me .
very ?
uh huh .
oh dog , you' re a point killer .
oh !
hey , take it easy .
you startled me .
i' m sorry .
you know , i pity him sometimes .
he' s so alone .
the only one of his kind in the world .
well , he' s like an orphan of time .
yeah , i' ve been thinking about it .
your going into the tank ... it' s risky , too risky .
i' d sleep better if you' d leave him tojoe and me .
well , haven' t i been a help ?
that' s not what i' m talking about .
it' s ...
well , it' s just that he' s so unpredictable .
if anything were to happen ...
nothing' s going to happen .
don' t you think you' re making a lot out of nothing ?
he' s chained and you have the bull prod .
will you listen ?
you' re only going to be here a short time ... and using joe might hold you up .
move the ball around .
you gave him a bad jolt last time .
he' s leery .
that' s all right .
try it again .
careful , helen .
careful .
stop .
that' s amazing .
it took me three weeks to teach that to a chimp .
let' s try it again .
okay ?
okay , professor .
come on .
come on .
come on .
be careful , helen .
not too close .
come on .
helen . !
get back , helen . !
stop !
clete !
clete !
clete !
get out , helen !
get out !
clete !
helen , stand back .
clete !
stop .
stop .
stop .
what happened , clete ?
you all right ?
yeah , i' m all right .
lou , come here quick and give helen a hand .
you all right , helen ?
yeah .
he' s plenty mad .
let' s get outta here .
hey look , he broke the chain !
stand clear .
get back , all of you .
get back .
stand clear .
joe . !
aaah !
this is an emergency .
the gill man has escaped .
please . !
please clear the oceanarium .
get out , everybody .
the gill man has broken out ofhis tank .
clear the area .
mommy !
return to your cars .
don' t approach the beach side of the ocean .
he' il probably be heading toward the water .
it is four days since the gill man escaped .
conflicting reports place the fearsome creature as far north as norfolk , virginia ... and as far south as panama .
but most experts believe the monster is either dead or on its way back to the amazon .
come on , kids .
break it up .
we weren' t doing anything .
well , that' s good .
it' s time to go home .
come on , beat it .
okay , officer .
okay .
anything you say .
helen !
are you all right ?
helen !
chris ?
helen , you all right ?
helen . !
who is it ?
it' s clete .
where' s chris ?
well , i left him in the bedroom .
isn' t he there ?
no .
i heard him howl .
well , i' il be right with you .
i' il look for him outside .
chris ?
here , boy .
here , chris !
here , boy !
here , chris .
any sign of him ?
uh uh .
well , i wonder where he could be .
ah , don' t worry about him .
he' s probably chasing a rabbit .
he' il show up in the morning .
come on .
i' m glad you' re coming with me tomorrow .
we can take a leisurely cruise up the river and have dinner in jacksonville .
my plane doesn' t leave until midnight ... so maybe we can go stepping for a couple of hours , if you like .
oh , it sounds wonderful .
will you miss me ?
it' il be the longest three months .
good bye , helen .
good bye , clete .
good bye .
see you , george .
thanks a lot .
have a nice trip .
sorry about everything that happened .
bye .
bye , fellas .
now stop worrying about chris .
it' s not like him to take off like that .
look , he' il probably be waiting for you on your doorstep when you get home .
i hope so .
for a scientist , i sure am a sentimental fool .
stay that way .
come on now .
let' s enjoy the trip .
sure there' s nothing i can do to help ?
everything checks , but nothing works .
well , yell if you need me .
okay .
ready ?
sure .
let' s go .
hey , cut it out .
so you want to play , huh ?
that does it .
try to pull my leg , will you ?
huh ?
for a professor , you certainly have the manners of a freshman .
hey , professor , come on back .
it' s all fixed .
fun' s over .
did you have fun ?
oh yes , it was wonderful .
we better get going .
okay .
whew , it' s hot .
let' s go outside .
all right .
well , prince charming vanishes at midnight ... and i won' t see him for three long months .
maybe i can stretch a weekend .
might as well be broke , it' s the way i am .
you know , scientists are funny .
we probe and measure and dissect .
invent lights without heat , weigh a caterpillar' s eyebrow .
but when it comes to really important things , we' re as stupid as the caveman .
important ?
mm hmm .
like love .
makes the world go round , but what do we know about it ?
is it a fact ?
is it chemistry , electricity ?
once when i had a crush on the captain of the high school football team ,
i looked it up in the dictionary .
and love , according to mr. webster , is " a feeling of strong personal attachment induced by sympathetic understanding .
have you ever heard such nonsense ?
i don' t know .
some things should remain unknown .
i think a poet once said ,
but love is such a mystery , i cannot find it out .
for when i think i' m best resolved , i then am most in doubt .
helen !
help !
helen . !
what was that ?
i don' t know .
aaah !
helen !
the gill man has kidnapped a woman from the lobster house ... at the foot of pier nine .
pier nine .
units one , seven alerted to pier nine .
that' s us .
helen !
man in the water by the buoy .
over here !
here !
67 ...
this is a 67 .
clear the streets of traffic .
order citizens indoors .
police cars on detail nine one will report to waterfront .
the gill man is loose in jacksonville ... after kidnapping miss helen dobson , a science student .
it is believed the monster may be on the prowl , ready to attack others .
the police have requested us to advise all citizens ... to remain indoors until further notice .
it is suggested that you keep all lights on ... as the creature seems not to be able to stand bright light .
so i say to the old man , " why should i stay in school ?
you never finished and you' re doing okay .
you can' t get a job without a college degree .
it' s like my pop says it .
a college degree is like a high school diploma used to be .
he says ...
hey .
what' s that ?
looks like a body' s been washed ashore .
think we' d better ...
yeah .
is she all right ?
she' s alive .
aaah !
no !
no !
car two four , the report from area 78 is incorrect .
got it ?
it is incorrect .
the gill man has not been sighted in that area .
he could be headed for brazil by now .
yeah .
the bodies of two men have been found on the banks of the saintjohn' s river .
car one nine investigate bodies found near car below point diego .
could be him .
let' s go .
get a load of that .
there' s another one over there .
look !
all emergency equipment is being mobilized at point diego ... where the bodies of two students , victims of the gill man , were found .
so far there has been no trace of miss helen dobson , the pretty , young scientist kidnapped by the monster .
her fiance , professor clete ferguson , is aiding in the search .
the police department asked me to repeat this message .
civil defense trucks and floodlight equipment will report to point diego .
all right men , settle down and give me your attention .
i want you to comb this beach and surrounding area carefully , but under no circumstances are any of you to investigate ... shrubbery , hulks or other possible places of concealment ... unless you are accompanied by an armed guard .
now the trucks will disperse in both directions ... and unload about a thousand yards apart .
now you men all have flashlights .
i want you to check them right now to see whether they' re in order or not .
all right , come on .
turn ' em on .
good .
now if any of you spot the gill man , report to your group leader .
he' il fire his very pistol and the professor and i will get there as soon as possible .
may i say something to the men , captain ?
professor ferguson would like to say something to you .
i want to impress upon you once again something the captain said before .
don' t take any chances .
this is a thinking creature we' re hunting .
wily , cruel , dangerous .
as strong as any ten of you .
two men have already lost their lives tonight .
a girl is missing .
i want to find that girl alive more than anything else in the world , but i don' t want a single one of you men to risk your life needlessly .
remember that this creature can' t stay out of the water for more than a few minutes .
that limits our search to a narrow strip along the river .
so , please , obey the captain' s instructions to the letter .
the moment you spot the gill man , report it to your group leader ... and he' il fire his very pistol .
that' s it , men .
get at it .
hold it !
joe , turn that light back .
i think i saw something .
anything to make you happy , mac .
hold it .
i knew i saw something .
i can' t make it out , but that' s no gill man , bub .
it' s not driftwood either , buster .
i' m gonna take a look see .
any of you guys want to go with me ?
joe , keep this lamp right where it is .
right .
if you find anything , make with the high sign .
yeah .
holy cow !
a flea couldn' t get through there , professor .
hey , they found him .
let' s move , boys .
aaah !
aaah !
remember your instructions .
the professor is in command for now on .
you take orders from him .
aaah !
aaah . !
there he goes .
watch out for the girl .
hold your fire .
stop !
stop !
help !
stop !
stop !
stop . !
come toward me slowly .
don' t make any sudden moves .
steady .
hold your fire .
steady .
that' s it .
