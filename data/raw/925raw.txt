malibu' s most wanted
growing up in the streets ain ' t no joke .
there' s crazy crime ... drugs ... and mad violence .
yeah , the streets is tough .
but there ain ' t no streets tougher than mine .
the streets of ...
malibu .
it' s hardcore up in the ' bu , y' all .
it' s just part of the everyday struggle .
things go down here people should never see .
we got bag ladies ... big ballers ... everybody strapped with a 9 .
this is my ghetto .
the mall .
most of the time the police won ' t even come through .
we got all sorts of sets up in here .
we got the beach boys ... the a ccs : the abused children of celebrities ... and this is my crew .
that' s my boy mocha .
that brother straight up crazy .
he did time in public school !
that there is hadji .
he' s the beast from the middle east .
and that' s monster .
she had a big chip on her shoulder ... till she ate it .
hey , that' s me !
b rad g.
i run things around here .
now , sometimes bustas be disrespecting .
and you can ' t punk out , no matter what the devil may bring .
hey , yo , fool !
we about to have some hardcore drama go down right about now !
that' s right !
this our mall .
always has been , always will be .
mr. amerislani .
our clerk accidentally gave you the wrong aromatherapy candles .
here you go !
you validate parking ?
of course , sir .
that' s what i' m talking about !
we get ours !
that' s my crib .
it ain ' t much , but it' s all i got .
if you elect me governor ....
that' s my pops , bill gluckman .
he getting his campaign on .
i got mad love for the man , but he ' s old school .
he needs to bring his word to the street .
that' s where i come in .
you see , friends ...
california is my family .
and speaking of family , i want to introduce my wife , bess .
and my daughter , little brenda .
where' s your son brad ?
yes , sir , where is he ?
thank you for your questions .
unfortunately , we are out of time for today .
yo , what' s up , y' all ?
this is b rad g , kicking it from ' bu .
represizzent !
hi , pops , it' s me !
b rad !
hi , brad .
show' s over !
that' s it .
show' s over !
see that ?
i know how to get the party started !
and i know my pop was loving it .
it' s a disaster !
the times and the chronicle will run it as a big joke .
thank god !
how did this happen ?
i have no idea .
i didn' t even know he was in town !
we can' t keep tabs on this kid ?
can anybody tell me where he is ?
that was off the hinges !
i just got you another million votes right there !
what you doing here , son ?
i knew i had to show up in order for you to blow up !
so i called up captain tony , he fired up the lear jizzy ... and boo yah !
i' m in the hizzy .
i' il be on the campaign trizzy too .
24/ 7 .
you know , kissing babies and whatnot .
pound it .
yeah , all good .
tom , you down , you gots ....
okay , dude .
i' il let you all do your campaign thing .
oh , bill ....
you need to shut this down .
tell your son that he cannot be in your campaign , period .
wait a minute .
i love his enthusiasm .
it' s a little misguided , but ....
isn' t there something he can do for the campaign where he can' t hurt us ?
no .
phones ?
no .
stuffing envelopes ?
making signs ?
signs .
in bill gluckman' s administration ... women are going to have better health care .
women are going to have better daycare !
and women will have better jobs !
bill gluckman is down with the bitches and the ho' s " ?
it was supposed to have read " women are first with gluckman .
no , no .
that' s old school , pops .
you need to keep your pimp hand strong .
so , bradley ....
yo , why you keep calling me that ?
well , that' s your name , isn' t it ?
it' s my slave name , all right ?
i told you like 50 times !
okay .
b rad .
what' s up ?
what are your goals , b rad ?
what do you want out of life ?
to be the biggest rapper there ever was .
you see , doc , i got something to say ... and i need the world to hear it .
i' m a " lyrisologist .
i can rap about anything .
see ?
i' m the shiznit !
i' il buy y' all cars .
i see .
when did you first start feeling like you were this ... shiznit ?
dang , way back in the day .
i had these beats in my head since i was a little shorty .
from then on in , it was hip hop 24/ 7 .
as i was growing up , my parents and me couldn ' t communicate .
they were always on different channels .
finish those vegetables , bradley .
they smell good .
you won ' t be excused until you do .
forget y' all !
that' s it , mister
what i ' m sensing , brad ... is that ... your parents weren ' t always there for you .
no .
that' s ridiculous .
what about your bar mitzvah ?
what' s the theme of your bar mitzvah ?
star wars ?
baseball ?
superheroes ?
it' s o. p. p. , bitch !
what ?
bess .
i think you want to share .
b rad , you' re a wonderful son .
it' s just that ....
well ....
bess , let' s not beat around the bush .
brad ... your behavior has become an embarrassment to the family .
don' t be hating .
and i can' t have you on the campaign anymore .
what ?
that' s how it is ?
you done it now !
y' all opened up big a can of tough love !
what can we do , doctor ?
i don' t know .
this is the most advanced case of " gangsta phrenia " i' ve ever seen .
three colors for our country .
where' s the red ?
bill !
hey , bill .
how' d it go with dr. feldman ?
great .
if he sees brad five times a week for the next three or four years ... we should see some real improvement .
but , sir , the election is eight weeks away .
right , good point .
it' s okay .
we' ve been brainstorming some different approaches ...
... and we might have something solid .
well , i' m all ears .
go !
okay , sir .
brad acts ghetto , right ?
but he' s never been east of beverly hills .
but what if we give him a little dose of reality ?
let him get a firsthand look at the ghetto .
you mean have brad actually go there ?
exactly .
well , now , that sounds dangerous .
no !
perfectly safe .
how' s it work ?
we hire actors to play gangstas .
right .
they will carjack brad and take him on a tour around the ' hood .
give him a taste of what the thug life is really like .
it might just scare the black out of him .
excuse me ?
hey , don' t you have something to do ?
enough of the p. c.
fact is , unless we do something now , brad is going to cost us this election .
who would play the gangsters ?
remember the anti crime spot we shot a month ago ?
we' ve got that queued up .
yes , we do .
over here , please .
for too long , street violence has torn californians apart .
bill gluckman wants to put our divisions behind us .
hey , instead of thinking about what set you' re from ... or what crew you ' re rolling with ... why don ' t you both be brothers ?
what do you say ?
your hair looks great .
i ain' t never thought of it like that .
shake hands .
you see ?
california is my family .
if we all work together as a family , there' s no telling how high we can go .
see , that' s beautiful .
these are the guys we' re talking about .
all right , let me get this straight .
you want us to scare this kid into acting like a little white boy again ?
if you don' t think you can handle it
of course we can handle it .
i' m from juilliard , for chrissake .
i' m from the pasadena playhouse .
good .
i have some background information on our dear boy brad .
materials .
mali bootay ?
yes , he considers himself a rapper of sorts .
frigging a.
the story is your basic kidnapping .
by kidnapping , you mean we hold him for ransom ?
good question .
right .
now , when you see him start to get ghetto and do his whole black thing yes , that .
i want it to piss you off .
tour him around the ' hood , around the ghetto , if you will ...
... and show him what it' s really like .
ln the ghetto ?
pays 1 5 grand apiece , son .
we' re in .
good .
now , on the flip side ....
flip it .
if you two screw up and a single hair is touched on brad' s overprivileged head ...
i will see to it personally that you two do some serious time .
are we clear ?
oh , we are cristal .
i like that .
mr. gibbons .
what about the money ?
we have 5 up front ... and 25 when you return him to us ... white .
as the driven snow .
pleasure doing business , gentlemen .
let me get that for you , sir .
i' il call you .
or better yet , i' il holler .
we' il holler back !
holler back , player .
thank you .
all right .
congratulations , buddy !
we just booked another gig !
not so fast , this is dangerous stuff .
this is the ghetto .
we could get shot !
come on , man .
we can handle ourselves .
right ?
this will be the ultimate acting challenge .
you know what really chaps my ass ?
what ?
after all of our years of training and studying ... they continue to give us parts that are gangbangers .
just once i' d like to play someone who speaks with proper grammar ... and doesn' t wear those timberlands with the laces undone , it' s so sloppy .
it beats getting dunked on by bill gluckman !
do we even know anybody that lives in the ghetto ?
my cousin .
shondra .
that' s the stupidest thing i ever heard .
i got better things to do with my time .
like what ?
work at wiener on a bun ?
come on !
really , you' re always talking about improving yourself .
here' s your chance !
i am improving myself , fool !
i broke up with no good , gangbanging tec , i' m going to beauty school ... and then i' m gonna hook up my own salon .

nothing to do but keep it real and be proud of who you are .
