she' il split for a day or two , then she' il come back .
she' s just spun .
this is for you .

so i gotta pop by spider' s and drop this shit off .
you can either come with or i could take you somewhere , whatever is best .
it' s that fucking bastard .
how can somebody be such a selfish , insensitive ... ... fucking motherfucking bastard ?
he never cared about anything !
the only time he was nice to me was when i first met him .
when , of course , i' ve never done speed before .
and he was nice to taco to boot , okay ?
fucking fuck face fucker .
it' s nikki and ross .
hey , come on in .

what' s the real deal between you and nikki ?

so why are you with ross ?
it' s too hot .
because i have a car .
i' ve been helping her out with my car .
he brings me places .

helping her out , taking her around .
he wants to drive me around .
yesterday , the dog got sick .

just came here to ...
right now i' m on my way to the bus stop ...
yeah , yeah , i understand , man .
i understand .
yeah .
amy .
i just thought maybe we could ...
really ?
oh , come on .
you know i hate fucking hippies , man .
you know why i hate hippies ?
because i was downtown ... ... and this kid just comes running out and gets hit by a bus , right ?
and the bus just crushes him and crushes him ... ... and runs over him , and the kid' s just squiggling on the ground .
amy .
and blood is coming out of his ears , and he' s just laying there ... ... and then this hippie dyke chick comes out with crystal ... ... and she rubs it all over him .
i wish that i had more energy .
amy .
and the kid is just laying there , and he' s choking on his own blood .
it' s like , " come on , you dumb , stupid chick .
what are you doing with your crystals ?
he needs a doctor .
i wish i could sleep forever , man .
i wish .
i wish .
you know , i' ve seen some crystals do some pretty trippy shit , man .
really ?
i was out with one of my girlfriends once in vegas ...
amy .
and we were hanging out , and we picked this guy up .
i think he was a mexican .
i wish i was black .
and we both fucked him .
amy .
anyways ... ... she got crabs really bad .
and i was wearing this crystal around my neck all night long , and i never got them .
magic crystals .
amy .
no , nikki , nikki .
what happened was ... ... that your friend fucked him first , and the crabs jumped onto her bush ... ... before they got a chance to get onto yours .
that' s what happened .
you got lucky you got sloppy seconds .
there' s no such thing as magic crystal hippie crap bullshit .
