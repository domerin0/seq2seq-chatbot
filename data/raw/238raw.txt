you fool .
no man can kill me .
die now .
i am no man .
fifteen !
sixteen !
seventeen !
twenty nine !
legolas !
thirty three , thirty four .
that still only counts as one !
all right , then .
come on !
i know your face ... ...
owyn .
my eyes darken .
no .
no .
i am going to save you .
you already did .
owyn ... ... my body is broken .
you have to let me go .
i go to my fathers ... ... in whose mighty company ... ...
i shall not now feel ashamed .
owyn .
release us .
bad idea .
very handy in a tight spot , these lads , despite the fact they' re dead .
you gave us your word .
i hold your oath fulfilled .
go .
be at peace .
merry .
merry , it' s me .
it' s pippin .
i knew you' d find me .
yes .
are you going to leave me ?
no , merry .
i' m going to look after you .
hands off !
that shiny shirt , that' s mine .
it' s going to the great eye , along with everything else .
i don' t take orders from stinking morgul rats !
you touch it , and i' il stick this blade in your gut .
the scum tried to knife me .
kill him !
that' s for frodo !
and for the shire !
and that' s for my old gaffer !
stop your squealing , you dunghill rat .
i' m gonna bleed you like a stuck pig .
not if i stick you first .
sam !
oh , sam , i' m so sorry .
sorry for everything .
let' s get you out of here .
it' s too late .
it' s over .
they' ve taken it .
sam ... ... they took the ring .
begging your pardon , but they haven' t .
i thought i' d lost you .
so i took it .
only for safekeeping .
give it to me .
give me the ring , sam .
sam .
give me the ring .
you must understand .
the ring is my burden .
it will destroy you , sam .
come on , mr. frodo .
we best find you some clothes .
you can' t go walking through mordor in naught but your skin .
we did it , mr. frodo .
we made it to mordor .
there are so many of them .
we' il never get through unseen .
it' s him , the eye .
we have to go in there , mr. frodo .
there' s nothing for it .
come on .
let' s just make it down the hill for starters .
frodo has passed beyond my sight .
the darkness is deepening .
if sauron had the ring , we would know it .
it' s only a matter of time .
he has suffered a defeat , yes ... ... but behind the walls of mordor , our enemy is regrouping .
let him stay there .
let him rot !
why should we care ?
because 10, 000 orcs now stand between frodo and mount doom .
i' ve sent him to his death .
no .
there is still hope for frodo .
he needs time and safe passage across the plains of gorgoroth .
we can give him that .
how ?
draw out sauron' s armies .
empty his lands .
then we gather our full strength and march on the black gate .
we cannot achieve victory through strength of arms .
not for ourselves .
but we can give frodo his chance if we keep sauron' s eye fixed upon us .
keep him blind to all else that moves .
a diversion .
sauron will suspect a trap .
he will not take the bait .
certainty of death ... ... small chance of success ... ... what are we waiting for ?
to the gate , you slugs !
move it !
to the gate !
look , the orcs ... ... they' re moving off .
you see , mr. frodo ... ... some luck at last .
take mine .
there' s a few drops left .
there will be none left for the return journey .
i don' t think there will be a return journey , mr. frodo .
frodo , get down !
hide !
frodo !
where are they ?
let the lord of the black land come forth !
let justice be done upon him !
fall back .
fall back !
it' s gone , mr. frodo .
the light' s passed on , away towards the north .
something' s drawn its gaze .
hold your ground !
hold your ground .
sons of gondor , of rohan , my brothers !
i see in your eyes ... ... the same fear that would take the heart of me .
a day may come when the courage of men fails ... ... when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship .
but it is not this day .
an hour of wolves and shattered shields ... ... when the age of men comes crashing down .
but it is not this day .
this day we fight !
by all that you hold dear on this good earth ... ...
i bid you stand , men of the west !
never thought i' d die fighting side by side with an elf .
what about side by side with a friend ?
aye .
i could do that .
do you remember the shire , mr. frodo ?
it' il be spring soon .
and the orchards will be in blossom .
and the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket .
and they' il be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields ... ... and eating the first of the strawberries with cream .
do you remember the taste of strawberries ?
no , sam .
i can' t recall the taste of food ... ... nor the sound of water ... ... nor the touch of grass .
i' m ... ... naked in the dark .
there' s ...
there' s nothing .
no veil between me and the wheel of fire .
i can see him ... ... with my waking eyes .
then let us be rid of it ... ... once and for all .
come on , mr. frodo .
i can' t carry it for you ... ... but i can carry you .
come on !
aragorn .
elessar .
for frodo .
look , mr. frodo .
a doorway .
we' re almost there .
clever hobbits to climb so high !
frodo !
eagles .
the eagles are coming !
frodo !
i' m here , sam .
destroy it !
go on !
now !
throw it in the fire !
what are you waiting for ?
just let it go !
the ring is mine .
no .
no .
no !
yes !
yes !
precious !
precious !
precious !
precious !
give me your hand !
take my hand !
no !
don' t you let go .
don' t let go .
reach !
frodo !
frodo !
it' s gone .
it' s done .
yes , mr. frodo .
it' s over now .
i can see the shire .
the brandywine river .
bag end .
gandalf' s fireworks .
the lights in the party tree .
rosie cotton dancing .
she had ribbons in her hair .
if ever i was to marry someone ... ... it would' ve been her .
it would' ve been her .
i' m glad to be with you , samwise gamgee ...
... here at the end of all things .
gandalf ?
frodo !
gimli !
now come the days of the king .
may they be blessed .
this day does not belong to one man ... ... but to all .
let us together rebuild this world ... ... that we may share in the days of peace .
my friends ...
... you bow to no one .
and thus it was .
a fourth age of mlddle earth began .
and the fellowshlp of the rlng ... ... though eternally bound by frlendshlp and love ... ... was ended .
thlrteen months to the day slnce gandalf sent us on our long journey ... ... we found ourselves looklng upon a famillar slght .
we were home .
hi .
hey , watch the pumpkin .
rosie , rosie .
good night , lads .
how do you plck up the threads of an old ilfe ?
how do you go on ... ... when in your heart you begln to understand ... ... there is no golng back ?
there are some thlngs that tlme cannot mend ... ... some hurts that go too deep ... ... that have taken hold .
mr. frodo ?
what is it ?
it' s been four years to the day since weathertop , sam .
it' s never really healed .
a hobblt' s tale by bilbo baggins .
and the lord of the rlngs by frodo baggins .
you finished it .
not quite .
there' s room for a little more .
bilbo once told me hls part in thls tale would end ... ... that each of us must come and go in the telilng .
bilbo ' s story was now over .
there would be no more journeys for hlm ... ... save one .
tell me again , lad , where are we going ?
to the harbor , bilbo .
the elves have accorded you a special honor ... ... a place on the last ship to leave middle earth .
frodo ... ... any chance of seeing that old ring of mine again ?
the one i gave you .
sorry , uncle .
i' m afraid i lost it .
oh .
pity .
i should like to have held it one last time .
well , here' s a sight i have never seen before .
the power of the three rings is ended .
the time has come ... ... for the dominion of men .
i think i' m ... ... quite ready for another adventure .
farewell ... ... my brave hobbits .
my work is now finished .
here at last , on the shores of the sea ... ... comes the end of our fellowship .
i will not say , " do not weep " ... ... for not all tears are an evil .
it is time , frodo .
what does he mean ?
we set out to save the shire , sam .
and it has been saved .
but not for me .
you don' t mean that .
you can' t leave .
the last pages are for you , sam .
you cannot always be torn in two .
you will have to be one and whole for many years .
you have so much to enjoy and to be and to do .
your part in the story will go on .
well ... ...
i' m back .
lay down
your sweet and weary head
nlght is falilng
you have come to journey' s end
sleep now
and dream o f the ones who came before
they are calilng
from across the dlstant shore
why do you weep ?
what are these tears u pon your face ?
soon you will see
all of your fears will pass away
safe in my arms
you' re only sleeplng
what can you see
o n the horlzon ?
why do the whlte gulls
call ?
across the sea
a pale moon rlses
the shlps have come
to carry you home
and all will turn
to silver glass
a ilght on the water
all souls pass
hope fades
into the world of nlght
through shadows falilng
o ut of memory and tlme
don ' t say
we have come now to the end
whlte shores are calilng
you and i will meet agaln
and you' il be here in my arms
just sleeplng
what can you see
o n the horlzon ?
why do the whlte gulls
call ?
across the sea
a pale moon rlses
the shlps have come
to carry you home
and all will turn
to silver glass
a ilght on the water
grey shlps pass
into the west
