sister viridiana .
i' ve just had a letter from your uncle .
he won' t be able to come when you take your vows .
all right , mother .
you don' t seem to mind very much .
i hardly know him .
i saw him only once , some years ago .
in any case he' s asking you to come and stay with him .
i don' t want to leave the convent , mother .
i' m afraid that his health is not good .
he' s your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows .
but why does he want to see me ?
he has never bothered about me .
he has paid for your studies , and he has just sent your dowry .
does that mean so little to you , viridiana ?
i have no desire to see the world again , but if you order me to ...
the retreat will start soon .
you can leave tomorrow morning .
everything you need for the journey has been put in your cell .
try to show him some affection .
that' s enough for today , rita .
do you like that rope i gave you ?
it' s easier to jump with , it' s got handles .
go and play .
leave it .
good day .
hello .
welcome , miss .
i' m ramona , don jaime' s servant .
pleased to meet you .
viridiana !
excuse me .
how are you uncle ?
i' m well ...
the bus was late , wasn' t it ?
what was the journey like ?
excellent .
what a charming , peaceful place , uncle .
you' il think you' re still at the convent .
how long are you staying ?
i' ve been given permission to stay only a few days .
was that difficult to get ?
no .
mother superior told me to come .
did you have so little interest in seeing me ?
to tell you the truth , not very much .
i cannot lie .
i respect you and i am grateful to you , but otherwise ...
you have no feelings toward me ...
no .
you are right .
being alone has made me self centered .
unfortunately , it' s too late now , isn' t it ?
yes .
it' s too late .
you' ve been neglecting the farm , uncle .
these past 20 years , weeds have invaded everything .
there are spiders all over the house except on the first floor .
i hardly ever go out .
it' s true .
when he goes out he makes me jump rope .
come down here , you scamp !
who is she ?
my maid ramona' s daughter .
come down .
she' s a little animal .
how like your aunt you are , even in your walk .
i know , you' ve told me that already .
incredible , even the voice .
she has made her bed on the floor , sir !
she has something in her suitcase that looks like thorns .
her nightgown is made of some rough cloth .
it really must tear her skin !
such beautiful skin , sir .
leave me now .
you can go to bed .
yes , sir .
good night .
good morning , moncho .
good morning .
good morning , rita .
how are we today ?
today , a good girl .
could i trouble you for my glass of milk ?
certainly , miss .
is that difficult ?
not at all .
here , try it yourself .
but i wouldn' t know how .
sit down there .
pull harder !
squeeze hard !
keep quiet !
grab it .
don jaime is very good at it !
get out of there !
no !
get me those buckets over there .
don' t be afraid , miss .
i' il guide you .
come on , pull !
no i can' t .
i saw you in your nightgown !
what ?
yes , yes , i saw you !
don' t take her seriously , she' s a liar .
i saw her !
when she was dressing , her pins fell out and she picked them up .
how did you see me ?
from the terrace .
it' s not nice to spy .
coming to the hen house with me ?
no , i don' t want to .
thanks .
hello !
good morning , uncle .
you' re very early this morning .
so that i can see a little bit more of you .
i' m going to make you a nun' s cake .
it will make your mouth water .
you are spoiling me too much .
i won' t know what to do with myself when you' ve gone .
only because you want it .
what do you mean ?
nothing .
i didn' t say anything .
you don' t trust me , do you ?
what do you want to know ?
very well !
i can' t keep things to myself .
is it true that you have a son ?
how did you know about that ?
i heard my mother talking about it once .
but is it true ?
yes , it is .
what do you know about life ?
you couldn' t possibly understand .
you should have brought up the child .
his mother wanted to keep him .
she came from a poor family .
i was in love with your aunt .
i would like to have acknowledged him but i was afraid of losing her .
that' s why i didn' t say anything .
and this innocent child ?
don' t worry .
he won' t be forgotten .
you must think i am a monster .
no , but what a pity life is like that .
it was going to drown .
who' s there ?
is she up yet ?
she' s been up for some time .
she asked me to get her things ready .
her last day in this house !
i' il never see her again if she leaves .
why don' t you ask her to stay on for a few days ?
i have asked her but she' s ungrateful .
sometimes i feel like hitting her .
when i talk to her about the convent , she turns to stone .
come here , ramona .
sit down .
i' m going to need your help .
what' s the matter ?
sit down .
sit down , woman .
you like me , don' t you ?
i' d be really ungrateful , if i didn' t .
you took me and my little girl in when i didn' t know where to turn .
yes , yes , but there' s no need to bring that up .
how far are you prepared to help me ?
just say the word , sir , and i' il do anything .
why don' t you speak to her , ramona ?
women are good at that sort of thing .
think of something that will make her stay a few more days .
you are kind , ramona !
speak to her .
i know i don' t need to offer you anything , but if you' re successful in this
i' il not forget you or your little girl .
why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her ?
you' re right , but we must do something .
you must think of something , and i' il help you to my utmost .
look in the cupboard .
on the upper shelf , there' s a little blue bottle .
there' s no label on it .
you' il find some white pills inside .
this one , sir ?
yes , leave it there .
go on with your work .
i' il tell you what to do later .
thank you .
i have never been able to do that .
why didn' t you wake me ?
they say it' s dangerous .
i don' t believe it .
a few years ago , the last time i sleepwalked , they woke me up by slapping my face .
and you can see i' m still alive .
what worries me is that i put ashes on your bed .
why ?
it' s no more odd than anything else .
people who walk in their sleep don' t know what they' re doing .
ashes mean penance ... and death .
then it' s penance for you who are going to be a nun and for me , who am old , it' s death .
i' il come with you to the village when you leave tomorrow .
thank you , uncle .
this evening we must do something special by way of a farewell .
whatever you like .
i would like you to do something for me .
today i can refuse you nothing .
you' il do what i ask , then ?
whatever you wish .
i' m at your command .
no , wait ...
what a silly thing !
it' s quite difficult for me to tell you what it is .
how strange you are !
when i asked you to do this favor for me you refused .
and now , here you are , making me so very happy all of a sudden .
thank you , my child !
i don' t like masquerading but i decided to give in to your whim .
it' s not a masquerade , nor is it a whim .
i' m going to tell you a secret .
your aunt died in my arms , on our wedding night wearing that dress .
you look so like her ...
you must think i' m mad .
no uncle , and now i' m pleased to have been able to do this favor , because , although i didn' t think so at first , you are really a good man .
if you only knew ...
when i was young i was full of idealism .
i wanted to do something on a big scale for others , something to show my great love for humanity .
but as soon as i tried to do something about it ,
i became afraid that i would be laughed at and i felt like a fool ... and so i went back into my shell .
wasn' t that cowardice ?
no , it isn' t that .
i wouldn' t be afraid in the face of real danger .
i' ve proved that to myself .
on the other hand , if a stranger visited me simply to say hello ,
i' d be alarmed .
i can' t take my eyes off you .
come , let' s sit down .
uncle , you mustn' t think that i won' t be sad to leave you .
it' s up to you entirely .
don' t leave , then ...
unfortunately ...
it' s my fault .
if i' d come to see you more often , invited you here for holidays , maybe everything would be different .
maybe ...
there' s one way you could stay .
if i asked ...
i mean , if i said to you ...
no , i can' t ...
what he wants , miss , is to marry you .
excuse me , sir , but i only said what you didn' t dare say yourself .
he loves you very much and he deserves to be loved in return , because he is a very good man .
you' re really serious ?
yes .
i don' t want you ever to leave this house .
you must be out of your mind .
i' ve been so happy these last few days ...
now you' ve spoiled it all .
i think it would be better if i went to my room .
wait !
forgive me !
stay a few more minutes !
if you go now , i' m afraid you' il always resent me .
i promise not to say anything that might annoy you .
i' il put some music on and we' il have a cup of coffee .
miss , take this , it' il do you good .
why are you crying ?
i' m afraid .
don' t invent stories , go to bed .
a black bull came .
a black bull !
it' s a very big one .
very ?
yes , very big !
he couldn' t get through the door , then ?
then how did it get in , silly ?
he came in through the cupboard .
you little liar !
get out of here !
i' m afraid .
here !
and call your mother if you' re having nightmares .
now go away and don' t annoy me .
you look very tired .
perhaps you' d better go to bed .
don' t think too badly of me , ramona .
i only want to have her close to me .
that will be all , ramona .
what are you doing ?
don jaime was kissing the lady .
he only kisses her because she' s his niece .
don' t i kiss you ?
you should be in bed .
a black bull came into my room .
be quiet .
i' m going to put you to bed .
i' m thirsty .
how do you feel ?
i have a headache .
that will soon pass .
it' s nothing .
what happened to me ?
you fainted last night after supper .
the master and i carried you here .
have i slept long ?
you slept well , don' t worry .
give me some water .
leave us alone , ramona .
don' t go !
leave .
please , i beg you .
i want to get up .
no .
you can never go away now .
last night you promised never to speak of that again .
an old man who lives alone and a young woman consecrated to god .
what could be more unlike ?
be quiet !
don' t you understand that i want to get dressed ?
i forgot everything because of you , even the passion that has kept me going all these years .
leave !
get up !
i must have been mad .
i thought that you would agree to marry me , but naturally you refused .
and now it' s the day that you must leave .
i had to force you .
that was the only way i could find to have you in my arms .
you' re lying .
last night when you were sleeping , i had you all to myself .
now you won' t be able to go back to your convent .
you' re not the same woman who left it a few days ago .
now , you' il have to stay with me here forever .
everything i have will be yours .
even if you don' t want to marry me , your presence here will be enough .
think about it .
don' t hurry .
think it over .
go away !
leave me alone .
what did you say to her , sir ?
the way she looked at me , ramona !
she hates me now .
i think i' ve made a great mistake .
she' s going away and nothing will stop her .
speak to her again .
explain everything to her seriously .
what for ?
she' il only look at me that way again ...
i couldn' t .
you go .
perhaps she' il listen to you .
try to convince her .
but what can i say to her , sir ?
tell her i lied , that i didn' t take advantage of her .
i did mean to do it , ramona .
but i realized in time what i was doing .
i spent the whole night turning my thoughts over in my mind ... and i lied to her so she wouldn' t go back to the convent .
tell her that .
go on , explain to her .
sir , come right away .
let me pass !
you must listen to me before you go .
i' ve listened to you long enough .
let me out .
all that i said just now was a lie .
i said it so you wouldn' t leave .
i only molested you in my thoughts ...
i can' t bear to have you leave me , hating me like this .
tell me you believe what i' m saying .
you disgust me ... even if what you say is true .
then you won' t forgive me ?
you believe me , don' t you ?
yes , sir .
don' t lie .
you don' t believe me either .
it' s all very odd , sir .
it' s all right , my girl , it' s all right .
it didn' t work this time , but you' il see .
now it will .
look how high it is !
let me have a little peace , won' t you ?
if i hadn' t dropped it ...
when you' re ready , miss .
i' il take your bag , miss .
how do you do , miss viridiana !
is anything the matter , mr. mayor ?
you cannot leave ...
why not ?
there' s been an accident .
where ?
come with me .
he' s over there .
give it to me .
it' s mine !
i' il slap you if don' t show some respect for the dead !
you mustn' t play under this tree .
don jaime loved to watch me skip .
if something terrible happens now it will be your fault .
you aren' t eating enough .
i' ve brought you a glass of milk .
this evening i' il bring you some meat .
you don' t look at all well !
the mayor told me that he' s taking care of your problems .
you can go to the village when you want to .
it' il do you good to see the world .
a visitor , miss .
leave us , ramona .
good morning .
you weren' t expecting me , were you ?
mother .
you must have suffered , my child !
i was worried .
ever since yesterday , when we heard about the tragedy , we have been very anxious for you .
i took the first train with mother consuelo .
why didn' t you write ?
i would have come immediately .
i had so many things to think about ...
you should have told me .
i talked for a few minutes to the parish priest in the village and he told me how it happened .
everybody is asking why this horrible offense was committed against our lord .
do you know the reason ?
i only know that my uncle was a grave sinner and i feel guilty for his death .
how can you say that !
you , responsible for the suicide of a man ?
i want a complete confession from you .
i' m not going back to the convent .
therefore i' m no longer under obedience to anyone .
is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows ?
there must be something .
i have nothing to reproach myself for .
all i know is that i' ve changed .
with all my strength , which is not much , i will follow the road that the lord has shown me .
are you aware of the pride there is in what you' re saying ?
what great plans are you thinking of dedicating yourself to now ?
i know my own weakness , and whatever i do will be humble .
but , however little it is , i want to do it alone .
very well .
as you won' t let me help you , i must leave you .
i' m very sorry i came and disturbed you .
goodbye .
mother !
forgive me if i have offended you .
you are forgiven .
goodbye .
why isn' t she coming ?
she has already crossed herself .
she' s a very firm believer .
i' ve heard she' s even going to pay us to go and live with her .
kind people !
don' t forget a poor blind man .
an alms for a sick blind man .
be generous !
there she is .
no more hanging around here for you , and fighting with the kids .
give the little girl to me .
come here , sweetheart .
are you ready ?
when you are , miss .
good , then let' s go !
she has the face of an angel .
what a pity you can' t see her .
keep the compliments to yourself .
i don' t like them .
here they come .
are you the other two ?
yes , miss , that' s us , yes .
good , come with me .
what a strange man !
i wish i knew what he was like .
as far as you' re concerned , worthless .
you can see how much he cared about you .
i' m not at all bitter about it .
anyone can love and forget .
why did he acknowledge me at the last moment ?
he was very good .
better than some people would think .
why did he kill himself ?
i don' t know , sir .
one shouldn' t be alone the whole time .
i' m not like him , am i ?
not in that way .
you' re always looking for company .
why do you say that ?
i know what i mean .
don' t play , sir .
i beg your pardon , sir .
the master used to play here a lot .
it was a real delight to listen to him .
if you don' t mind , i' il go get the other suitcase .
look at these beautiful fields !
and behind those pines the fields , dried up and abandoned .
there' s so much to do here and it' s all mine .
we won' t have time to get bored .
aren' t you happy ?
yes .
yes .
but i don' t know ...
i wish i hadn' t come .
look at that .
it' s very big ...
so much the better .
we' il all fit .
how many floors are there ?
two .
are there many windows ?
lots .
it' s got balconies and two big towers .
then it' s a respectable house .
have you repaired the windows of the dormitories ?
they shut all right now .
and the blankets are ready .
show them the rooms .
that miss is as good as gold .
she' s very good , but a bit of a simpleton .
the men will sleep on one side , the women on the other .
we will eat together .
we' il try to get you some decent clothes tomorrow .
viridiana !
miss ...
are you jorge ?
jorge , don jaime' s son , at your service .
i' ve been expecting you .
i got a letter from the lawyer .
this is lucia , she' s a good girl .
what' s your name ?
don' t touch me !
you' re going to sleep in the farmyard with the chickens !
get moving !
anyone who pokes around where he shouldn' t be will pay for it .
although we may be poor , every man has his dignity , brother .
don' t " brother " me , there is no scum in my family .
well now , even the servants put on airs here .
do you want me to smash your face ?
what' s going on , moncho ?
this louse is looking for trouble .
you runt !
don' t talk like that !
i' il talk the way i want to .
that' il teach you some manners .
blind , shit !
you can see now .
that' s enough !
in you go !
moncho , lead the way !
leave her .
you stay here .
would you mind telling me what i did to deserve your insults ?
i' ve had a gutful of this .
if you want to stay you' il have to exercise a little self control , and be a bit more humble to everybody .
if that' s the way , it' s better to leave .
give me something to go on with .
because i' m poor , without it ...
are you tired ?
i nearly walked my legs off today .
that has done me good .
why don' t you let me do that , miss ?
because i' ve got him into bad habits .
you can take the basin .
whenever you' re ready i can serve supper .
right , we' il have it now .
what' s the matter with you ?
nothing .
why the bad temper ?
it' s viridiana .
she' s getting on my nerves .
she' s mad .
no , she' s rotten with religion .
let her do what she wants .
she doesn' t bother us in any way .
do you know what i think ?
what' s annoying you is that she pays so little attention to you .
that' s the last straw !
look what you' ve done !
so , ramona !
run and get something to mop it up with , quickly .
that woman' s getting more and more stupid every day .
oh well .
i' m feeling good again ...
the tomatoes !
pass me the bread .
catch !
when i wasn' t so miserable i used to sell pigs .
i was more honest than my holy mother .
so you didn' t come from the poorhouse ?
say that again !
he has the devil in him .
you know what don zequiel told me yesterday ?
when it itches , how does he manage to scratch when he can' t see ?
tell him his mother comes to scratch me .
eat and shut up !
damned poca !
but i love you , amalio .
good evening !
good evening , miss !
benedictus !
come in , come in ...
you sit there .
and you there .
these are your new companions .
you must be hungry ...
god will reward you .
have you eaten well ?
i don' t want to criticize the saintly miss who is so good to us , but i would take the liberty of saying that the beans were acid .
what does that mean ?
sour , idiot .
don' t pay any attention to them , they' re peasants .
if don zequiel says the beans were bad it must be true .
we' il do something about it tomorrow .
now i' ve got some good news for you .
tomorrow , you can all get to work !
don' t worry .
you won' t need to do anything you don' t want to .
i only want you to have a bit of a change and to take some exercise .
miss !
i' m a cook .
i' m good at roasts and vanilla puddings .
last year i made pastry for the companza people .
good .
they can still remember it .
perfect !
you can help me with the accounts .
i can paint religious pictures .
before , i used to be able to write , but now with this leg i' ve forgotten .
i can weave hemp , but with the rheumatism in my fingers ...
what about you , manuel ?
i' m only good at making people laugh .
that' s all right , we all laugh here , but not at you .
i' il see to that .
i' ve got green fingers .
the priest will tell you .
so you won' t get bored here , there' il be more than enough for you to do !
look !
it' s disgusting .
let' s see it .
that' s leprosy .
throw him out , miss !
he has to leave .
let me see .
they' re varicose veins , miss , but some days i can' t take care of them .
are you sure it isn' t contagious ?
they told me it isn' t at the hospital .
don' t listen to him , miss .
i' ve known him for a long time .
they' re varicose veins .
it isn' t leprosy .
i' il take him to the doctor tomorrow .
it' s benign .
and you , look after him as if he were a sick brother .
be understanding .
now finish eating and then go to bed .
everyone in bed by eight o' clock !
you' il show the newcomers the dormitory .
good night everyone .
good night , miss .
if you don' t disappear , i' il make holes in your belly .
you' re not the one to make me move .
the miss , she understands , she told me i could stay .
hit him if he doesn' t get out !
calm down , people , calm down .
if anything happens , we' il all be thrown out .
out , the turd !
okay , that' s it .
i give in , but i' m staying on the grounds .
give me something for tomorrow morning .
i' il come to you tonight .
no , the children sleep with me .
give them to refugio .
no , i don' t want to because they yell .
and there' s a new one .
then i' il get you in the fields tomorrow ...
pass me the salt .
who' s there ?
jorge .
you frightened me .
it' s about time we spoke to each other , isn' t it ?
well ... is it so urgent ?
yes .
now that i have the chance .
when you' re not with your poor people , you' re praying or you disappear .
i never see you .
what' s the matter ?
i want to put in some electricity .
the electricity poles are installed , yet we' re living in the middle ages !
i want to make some improvements .
then there' s the land .
it really hurts me to think of it not producing anything .
i don' t know anything about these things .
but what' s your opinion .
do what you think is best .
is that everything ?
no it isn' t , there' s much more .
it seems absurd to be living under the same roof without knowing each other .
what do you know about me ?
i know that you used to work with an architect .
and do you know that i lived with my mother ?
tell me !
if my father had cared a little more about us , i' d be an architect now .
i don' t understand how you can like being alone so much .
i' m not like you , you have your wife .
we' re not married .
i don' t need anybody' s blessing to live with a woman .
i see that you ...
i ought to go .
good night .
the next time you come , knock first and wait until i tell you to come in .
i' il put some yellow in her face to show she is ill .
hurry up , i' m cramped all over .
it' s nearly finished , sweetheart .
i don' t like having to stay still for so long .
it seems to me that you ought to know damn well how to swing your ...
she looks like a pumpkin !
don' t pay any attention to him .
it' s very good .
i don' t like having to be the virgin .
you ought to be the one in bed .
i' d like to ask you , miss , to pose ...
me ?
just so the virgin can be really pretty .
it won' t take but a minute .
this votive offering is dedicated to the virgin of the helpless .
do you have great devotion for the virgin ?
i' m not a bigot , miss , but everybody has his own beliefs ... and then ... with this terrible thing ... if i didn' t have faith ...
did you sleep well , miss ?
yes .
may the lord watch over us ...
i must know when you expect to give birth .
why ?
heavens !
so the doctor can be warned .
in that case in about four months , but i can' t tell you exactly .
she doesn' t even know who the father was .
she said that it was night and she couldn' t even see his face .
the whole town doesn' t need to know .
shut up .
you shouldn' t speak like that in front of our holy protector , who is a well bred person .
i' m very sorry for you .
have you any other children ?
no , miss , it will be the first .
we' re going to the village .
with god' s and your own permission .
they must bring me some potatoes , bacon and rice .
take it and be careful not to be as late as you were yesterday .
could they bring me some tobacco ?
smoking makes him spit and feel ill .
it' s these filthy fag ends .
i won' t mention in this company what' s upsetting you .
bring the tobacco and i' il distribute it .
thank you , miss .
come over here and see the picture .
come on !
it' s very good .
thank you , but it' s missing something .
that doesn' t matter .
i like it .
how much is that ?
fifteen yards .
that' s fifteen by seven ?
good .
thanks pal , see you later .
goodbye , if you ever need anything ...
that animal can' t take any more .
now that the wagon' s empty , why don' t you let him ride ?
it' s for people !
then let him go and he' il follow you .
and let him get run over by somebody else ?
i' il buy him .
he' s good at rabbiting and he knows it .
if he doesn' t hunt , he doesn' t get fed .
how much do you want for him ?
if you want ...
i' il leave it to you .
all right , untie him .
thank you , and my god bless you .
get moving .
and remember , the less he eats , the better he runs .
what' s he called ?
canelo !
where are you going ?
come here , canelo !
come on !
let' s go , don' t be afraid .
have you thought of what you want planted yet ?
the fields have been left so long , with a good manuring anything will grow .
it' s land for wheat .
and for maize sometimes .
and the orchards ?
that' s good land .
what a miracle , you let yourself be seen .
have you come to look at the work ?
i' ve told you before i' m not interested in this .
the best thing my father left me was the land .
you can see the result of the work on it .
and if you helped me it wouldn' t take long to change it even more .
what are you doing here ?
get out .
leave him alone .
you won' t get much done with those people .
those times are over !
you ought to let me kick them out .
do they worry you that much , then ?
they worry me a great deal .
especially because of you .
there' s no point in helping some of them when there are so many others .
i know perfectly well how little i can do .
what i want to do is give passing beggars a roof , some food and a bit of human warmth .
is that all you' re going to devote your life to ?
i' m not sure yet .
i' ve had a shock recently , and i' m only beginning to get over it .
perhaps i' il go back to the convent one day .
get out of here !
swine !
why are they shouting at him ?
have they no pity ?
i don' t know what' s going on .
ask him .
these rascals are demons .
they' ve tied a can to him .
so they know when he' s coming .
i told you where to go until you' re cured .
the weather is wonderful , so i keep on walking and walking .
how are you today ?
things seem to be getting better .
hold your arm out .
you can' t hope to be cured quickly .
you heard what the doctor said .
but with the help of god , we' il pull through .
it all started one unlucky day .
a punishment from god because one windy day i was with a woman .
you' re the first good woman i' ve seen .
are your parents alive ?
parents ?
nobody cares a damn , what' s the use of them !
don' t say that .
it' s the truth .
don' t pay any attention , this man is no good .
he wants you to catch it too .
at church , he puts his arm into the holy water and says
may all those damn women get it !
the priest won' t let him in .
just you wait , liar !
stop this !
he' s lying !
ask the priest .
go join the others , and don' t come back here .
and you' il have to control your temper .
this must have been my grandfather' s .
wake me up tomorrow morning .
what are you going to do ?
what i do every day , but i want to start earlier .
nice knife !
good lord !
you' re happy , aren' t you ?
shouldn' t i be ?
you , on the other hand ...
i' m bored .
i' m alone all day and i don' t know what to do .
you should have enough to do in this house .
come here and listen to this .
what are you thinking about ?
that your cousin is more to your taste .
she isn' t my cousin .
it doesn' t make any difference what she is .
you like her .
i had a feeling i shouldn' t have come here .
i' d better get out , fast .
we ought to talk about that some other time .
how in hell does it wind up ?
i think i' d better go tomorrow .
don' t be a fool !
why rush away from something which couldn' t happen ?
you see how much you like her ?
that' s life .
some people are brought together , others are separated .
what can we do , if that' s the way it happens ?
don' t cry , lucia .
come on , darling .
what a thing !
where did father find that ?
hold on , ramon !
is there time to make another trip ?
no sir , it' s nearly six o' clock .
okay , let' s get a move on !
when are you leaving ?
tonight , but i' il be back tomorrow afternoon .
the angelus !
the angel of the lord declared to mary .
and she conceived by the holy ghost .
hail mary , full of grace ...
holy mary , mother of god , pray for us sinners ...
behold the handmaid of the lord .
be it done unto me according to thy word .
and the word was made flesh .
and dwelt among us .
the lord is with thee .
blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb jesus .
pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death .
pray for us , o holy mother of god .
that we may be made worthy of the promises of christ .
amen .
good bye , sir .
good bye .
see you tomorrow .
are they going to work here too ?
don' t worry .
nobody' s going to disturb you .
don' t forget the meeting with the lawyer .
the car will pick you up tomorrow morning .
i' il be ready .
do you intend to stay here for some time ?
yes .
why ?
you can come and live again in the big house .
now that i' m alone , i can settle down anywhere .
and your friend ?
she' s left .
is she coming back ?
no .
why ?
why does any man leave a woman ?
if you don' t understand , i don' t want to explain it to you .
you' re too cold and religious , you' d be shocked .
miss ...
you have decided to leave , moncho .
yes !
i can' t do anything to make you stay ?
these people annoy you , isn' t that it ?
well , what are you going to do ?
he' s coming to live with me .
if that' s what you want ...
but i' m very sorry you' re leaving .
thank you for everything , moncho .
god bless you .
obviously !
here' s the missing furniture .
what a state it' s in !
father must have been a peculiar type .
i don' t think the master ever came here .
and this chest ?
just some old curtains and drapes .
there must be some rat' s nest in there .
tell me .
you worked for my father for seven years , didn' t you ?
did he ever mention me ?
i can' t remember .
but i' m sure he loved you .
why ?
you wouldn' t be here otherwise .
these chairs are in good condition .
with a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable .
what are these sacks doing here ?
i don' t know .
they' ve always been there .
that' s stupid !
plaster !
it can still be used .
and those ?
that' s sand .
as i won' t be here tomorrow , tell the foreman to take them .
what' s wrong with you , woman ?
why are you looking at me like that ?
do you know something , ramona ?
if you took some trouble , you' d be quite pretty .
small teeth , nice lips .
what more do you want ?
let' s sit down a moment .
are we leaving ?
don jorge said he' d be waiting for you at the lawyer' s at four o' clock .
good .
you' re the most responsible here .
i' m handing them over to you .
don' t worry , i' il look after things .
do you want anything else ?
bring me a flute if you see one .
i' d like to learn music .
they' re going to hurt me .
well if they hurt you , put up with it !
let' s go !
good luck , miss !
thank you !
get in !
keep quiet .
these miserable brats only get in the way .
you' d like me to kill them ?
with the life that' s ahead of them ... they' d be better off being sent to paradise .
put her in the sun with her sister .
they' re gone .
now to knock off a couple of lambs .
we' il have them roasted .
what do you think of that ?
i' il go along with it ... if it' s being respectful enough .
what will the lady say ?
she won' t even know .
if everybody agrees .
but to make a roast takes four hours .
well , what' s all the hurry ?
didn' t you say you know how to make vanilla pudding ?
yes .
get the eggs and milk .
i' il see to the lambs .
don' t kill yourself , refugio !
can' t you see we' re alone ?
so ?
what' s the good of working ?
you keep quiet .
stick to your singing !
the miss left me in charge here and nobody is going to upset things .
because of you ...
what made you think that i was up to something ?
don zequiel !
refugio !
come here !
damn women !
how did you get in there ?
through a back window .
where are you going ?
come here , there' re wonderful things inside .
if it' s only to have a look ...
but don' t touch anything .
little dove from the south , you' re hurt .
what are you called ?
my little dove .
my dear dove .
my darling , sweet dove .
hey , you there !
get out !
or i' il bust your head in !
get lost !
you bastards !
i hope you get what i' ve got !
that woman , the one who looks like our miss viridiana , she' s the wife of the man who hanged himself .
think of hanging yourself , with all that money !
he must have had asthma .
all those loaded old men have asthma .
what stuff !
jesus , mary , and joseph .
how' s that for a tablecloth !
come on , let' s put it out .
that must have cost a fortune .
at least a thousand .
a thousand !
more like ten thousand !
can' t you see it' s french lace ?
fold it up , you' re going to spoil it .
we' re not doing any harm .
it' s not as bad as smoking his tobacco .
don zequiel' s right .
if those people come back and we don' t hear them ...
they won' t get back before tomorrow .
i heard them tell the driver .
if you haven' t eaten on lace like that , you haven' t lived .
watch it , don zequiel !
don' t worry .
we' il all clean it up .
pass me that bottle .
go on , don amalio !
it' s a real hen house here !
you can' t hear yourself speak .
tell me the answer to this !
what bird lays eggs in a barn ?
shut up , let' s hear don amalio !
tell us , don amalio ...
quiet !
we gathered together to beg under the porches .
but only in the churches of the rich !
the girls passing by ... smelled so sweet that you felt them on you .
you can smell them but you can' t lay your hands on them !
why did you split up ?
you , shut your face !
i won' t have questions from any one !
go on with the story !
okay , it broke up when this deaf fellow started on the collection boxes with a knife .
how did you know ?
the noise of the money in his pocket gave him away .
we hardly got a sou that day .
you know what i did ?
i told the police about him !
you sang because he didn' t cut you in , you rat !
the judges thanked me very much .
one of them said i was ...
what ?
shitty bastard , that' s what i' d call you !
he said " honest citizen " , if you want to know .
to your health !
and to lovely company !
you filthy little brat .
shut up or watch out !
what' s up with you ?
why are you screaming ?
don' t you touch my little girl .
keep the brat quiet so we can hear what' s going on .
i' il bust your face .
keep your hands off me , you filthy whore !
yes , leave her .
stop this !
let me go , don amalio , i' il tear her apart .
keep quiet .
she' s not worth paying attention to .
let' s behave ourselves nicely .
stick to your place .
my pudding !
leave it , you thief !
i' il remember this !
you' il see !
don' t touch me !
enedina ...
yes ?
enedina' s going to take a picture .
so we' il have a souvenir .
where' s the camera ?
it' s a present from my parents .
everyone to the other side !
stay quiet .
when i say " smile " , stop moving .
come on , quickly !
refugio , get your hair out of your face !
solve my riddle !
what bird lays eggs in a barn ?
the chicken !
nobody move .
the lousy man .
tables aren' t meant to lie on .
eat your pudding .
it' s a dream .
you have good taste , enedina .
this isn' t enedina .
little dove of the south ...
little dove ....
enedina , come here .
come on , drink up !
look at this , enedina .
over here .
what is it ?
come .
get down , you won' t see it otherwise .
just look at this !
isn' t it awful !
let me go !
leave them alone .
it' il make them sorrier later .
that' s just the thing for you !
don amalio .
what ?
enedina and paco .
what about them ?
they' re playing games behind the couch .
which couch ?
that one .
take me there .
guide me !
where are you , you swine ?
take me to them and i' il kill him .
now he has spoiled the party .
holy virgin , how can we clean up this mess ?
things are going to be worse than the cuban war .
we' il be better off if we' re seen in the village tonight .
if he were my man , he' d have his rights .
but as it is , why ?
you' re quite right , old dear .
now it' s every man for himself .
let' s go .
good night .
he doesn' t feel too well .
good night , don jorge .
we' re leaving now .
they told us you' d be back tomorrow .
i didn' t want to do it , don jorge .
they made me .
get out of here !
blessed are the generous , who take into their respectable house a poor defenseless blind man .
god will reward them .
didn' t you hear me ?
beat it .
okay , get out .
your lordship must not get annoyed ,
i have not done anything wrong .
i got him , comrade .
i got him !
my god , what have you done to him !
he was asking for it .
but why ?
why ?
jorge .
you shouldn' t cry over that .
if you' re without one man you can always find another to console you .
leave me alone !
jose !
for the love of god , don' t let him ...
nothing will happen to you , miss .
we' re all good folk here .
to the village !
we' ve got to warn the police .
they' il get them in no time .
get in , rita .
why all the fuss ?
it had to happen sooner or later !
help !
come here !
maybe afterwards he' il let me ...
come here !
if you help me , you' il be a rich man .
me , rich ?
come on !
there' s plenty of money in this house .
where ?
if i don' t keep my word , you can kill me .
i don' t want you to untie me .
kill him and then i' il give you the money .
where' s the dough ?
kill him and i' il tell you .
there are thousands of pesetas ...
kill him , idiot !
that will teach you , you son of a bitch .
where' s the cash ?
there in the cupboard .
it' s open .
on the top shelf .
under the linen .
up there .
let' s go !
i want a switch here .
and put a plug over there .
have you got over the scare you had yesterday ?
you can put the other plug there at the bottom .
the towel .
who' s there ?
where are you going ?
wait !
come in !
viridiana !
has something happened ?
did you want to speak to me ?
is there anything i can do ?
come in !
i must say , i was not expecting you .
we are playing cards ...
i hope you are not surprised by this pastime .
we must get through the long evenings .
do sit down !
don' t leave , ramona !
mademoiselle is not proud and she doesn' t mind your staying here .
you know how to play cards , cousin ?
no ?
then sit down .
i' m sure you' il like it .
you too , sit down .
all cats are gray at night .
do you like this music ?
it' s popular now .
cut !
like that .
my cousin viridiana will end up playing cards with me .
