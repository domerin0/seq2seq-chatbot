i love you , buck .
where' d you get them cannons ?
gunsmith in fort leavenworth .
where' d you get that funny bible ?
well , that my inheritance .
before the war , when i was a boy ... ... my mama and me was sold to a travelling preacher .
i' d fetch for him and take up collection .
and when he got drunk , i' d haul him off to bed .
he travelled in little towns , preaching sin and hellfire .
when he got them gals full of the holy spirit ... ... when they' re ready to repent , he' d jerk them .
between wiles ... ... he' d take my mama to bed .
and i' d sleep out with the horse .
by and by , about 16 , he sent me to town for a jug of whiskey .
when i come back , my mama was gone .
he sold her for a couple hundred dollars .
boy , put me to bed .
so i lead that man into the tanning yard by the lime pit .
and i put him to bed right there .
i hold him under with a cedar fence rail .
there was no next of kin .
so i got the cart , the horse ...
preacher clothes and this funny bible .
where are you gonna find that money ?
i don' t know .
if it was me , i' d look for money where money' s kept .
like in a bank or an express office .

they need supplies , and i can pay .
dried meat , as much as he can sell them .
horses , powder and shot .

no powder .
no guns .
ask him again .
tell him we' re all brothers .
he will not give you guns .
they come too hard .
food .
dried meat .
flour .
corn .
do not ask for more .
he stopped that posse because he gave his word to let you through safe .
he will do no more .
ask him again .
tell him they looking for their own land , and they' il have to fight for it ... ... because they can' t live back there , no way .
before the yellow hair , my father , my grandfather hunted buffalo ... ... raised pony and took women on the land ... ... where fox river crosses the grassland at place of skull .
now copper spring , fort sheridan .
now we are here with our backs against snow mountain .
and yellow hair send wagon , soldier and speaking wire .
tomorrow we will be like ghosts .
like the spirits that come in dreams with no earth to walk on .
but we will fight .
we will fight ten tens of years , and our children' s children will fight .
we need our guns , bullets and powder for our own fight .
tell him his enemies are our enemies .
he say you black people fought with that enemy against our people .
i ain' t in the army no more .
he knows , buck .
no guns .
no bullets .
eighteen hundred dollars .
that' s your share .
for what we have just received , we give thanks .
in jesus ' name , amen .
i' m going back east to illinois , and i' m gonna buy me a tent .
i' m gonna have the biggest revival meeting since king solomon ... ... preached to his wives and concubines .
amen .
and you , brother , you got a good woman there .
take that money and buy yourself a living and do like she want .
go to canada .
all right , brother .
one question .
how do i get out of here ?
to illinois ?
one of two ways .
go on back the way we come and on across kansas .
there' s a posse with a trigger hitch .
yes , there is .
what' s the other way ?
keep on west , across the pecos to where i' m going .
into the mountains and north along the idaho territory ... ... then back by the canadian border .
how long that take ?
all winter .
all winter .
what' s my chances of sneaking past the posse ?
not much .
when i caught you eating my rabbit ... ... i should' ve got me a rock , busted you upside your head and left you for dead .
scout come in .
that posse did not go back .
they' re tracking the wagon train .
how close are they to it ?
one day ride from the big river .
how long will it take us to catch them , riding straight through ?
maybe two days .
he will give you guides to take you through the high pass .
remember , they will not fight for you .
i know .
looks like the back door' s open .
figure i can skate on through and take my chances .
you done walked more than half the journey with the st. ann parish folk .
that' s all a normal man can do .
what do you wanna die for them for ?
what happened ?
somebody close the back door ?
if they' re gonna join up with them , they' il do it before sundown .
let' s finish off that wagon train .
they ain' t broke any laws i know about .
we gotta turn them around .
what you got against them folks ?
you on their side ?
you soft in the head for them ?
they killed uncle beau , robbed the bank .
they didn' t !
buck and that preacher did .
and that' s all we' re after .
you don' t understand .
i gotta turn them field hands around .
if we leave them fields go fallow now , we done lost it all .
we gotta keep it going like it was , the way they rightfully belong .
you got 16 white men down there .
sixteen .
you just give me half of them , and i' il finish that job .
as far as i' m concerned , that wagon train can go anywhere it likes !
and you make one move against those people ... ... i' il take you to copper springs with you tied under the belly of your horse .
where' s ollie ?
he went to cover the pass .
he' il say , " boo , " if that buck comes through .
what does he want us to do ?
take the wagon train .
well , if that' s what he said ...
let' s go !
you gonna have to take it to them .
what you gonna do ?
we can draw them south .
but ...
you go with the wagon train .
i' il come to you later .
get up on top .
go around in front of them and cut them off !
i run out .
