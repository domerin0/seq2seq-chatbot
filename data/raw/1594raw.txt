i can explain what happened .
you say that when it' s once in a while .
it' s every time , jerry .
it' s every fuckin ' time .
and i can certainly understand that perspective .
but i' ve been having some personal problems ... uh , with my life .
my girlfriend , she' s a great girl , but she has complaints .
i don' t but , she does .
if you want to know the truth ,
i can' t even believe this , but we go to a group .
so ... last week , when you guys told me to pick up the thing at the thing , well , samantha says she needs the car to pick up some things .
and , i don' t have to tell you boys , i mean , things got heated , right ?
and she hid them .
she hid them ?
oh !
the keys .
she hid them .
she ...
you know , and i couldn' t get to the thing on time , and it all got messed up and i think that maybe ...
maybe some things aren' t meant to happen .
jerry , you' re a fucking moron .
here are your options .
number one , i roll you up in a carpet , stuff you in a sedan and set fire to you .
you with me ?
choice one .
yeah .

you fucked up that job .
you fucked it up .
this job will be your last job .
ok , but a trip right now ...
he asked for you .
want me to call him and say you can' t go ?

we talked about this .
i told you .
i wanted us to go to las vegas for me .

don' t diminish my needs .
sweetheart , i don' t have a choice .
i gotta go .
i go down there , i come right back .
" i , i , i , i , i !
i wonder what the group would have to say about that .
no .
you cannot use that against me !
we are not even married , but i go .
the group thinks we' re married .
i accepted the potato slicer for our anniversary .
right , sweets ?
i go along .
that' s it .
that is it .
you ...
you ...
you go along !
you don' t want to get married .
and this is the way you deal with it !
huh ?
you' re back to the same old selfish , self involved , vile , disgusting ...
oh , god .
you are ...
.. self !
you' re missing the grand design here !
if i don' t go , i' m dead .
yeah .
and it' s difficult to have a relationship if i' m stuffed with formaldehyde .
now , if anyone is being selfish ...
oh !
now you blame shift ?
you are blame shifting ?
stop analysing !
i' m calling a time out !
ah !
all right ...
jerry , i want you to acknowledge ... that my needs mean nothing to you and you' re selfish .
oh , my god !
jerry , acknowledge .
i ...
ok .
i will acknowledge that i promised i would go to vegas with you .
but now we' re just slightly delayed .
if you want to construe my wanting to stay alive as being selfish , ok .
i have every intention of going with you .
your needs are important to me .
come on .
look at all my stuff here , all over the pavement .
come on , baby .
huh ?
what do you say ?
ok ?
i' m going with or without you , jerry .
what' s it gonna be ?

this is what they call the mexican .
wow .
yeah , that' s pretty .
are you shitting me ?
yeah , it' s pretty .
can i ?
uh huh .
it was made for a rich landowner , a nobleman , by a poor mexican gunsmith .
he fashioned this gun as a gift to go along with the hopes that the nobleman' s son would take his daughter' s hand in marriage .
' the townspeople waited three months
' to catch the first glimpse of the pistol .
' finally , the day had come .
' no one had ever laid eyes on a more beautiful gun .
' it was all they thought it' d be .
' some even thought it was too beautiful to look at .
' it was considered to be an honour and good luck
' to be the first to fire a newly fashioned gun .
' especially one as beautiful as this , made for the hand of a nobleman .
' the townsman was in a trance at the gun' s flawless craftsmanship .
' it backfired ...
' killing him instantly . '
legend has it that it' s been cursed ever since .
but it hasn' t harmed me any though , you know ?
i ...
i love to look at it .
( let me show you something .
look , there' s a bullet in there . )
( it' s handmade .
hand fucking made . )
you don' t even want to know what this gun is worth .
we could sell that gun , man .
it' s ...
it' s a great fucking gun .
and i' m not just talking shit either .
you don' t have to be a ...
fuck .
i' ve been pissin ' on myself .
fuck .
anyway , the old man is nothing to be afraid of .
as a matter of fact , last week i told him to fuck off .
yeah , you did !
that' s what i said too !
i said , " fuck off , margolese , you old prune shit ass !
if you ...
come on , fella .
get up .
huh ?
man , you' re soaked in your own urine .
don' t make me carry you .
hey !
ah , this is my life .
all right .
yeah , baby .

oh !

hey .

ooh .
hey , man .
hey .

' the gun is in your possession ? '

bad luck , act of god , fuck if i know .

i mean ...

the kid' s dead .
the little fucker' s in my car right now , dead .
geez , jerry , that' s not a little problem .
' that' s a big problem . '

' geez , you really fucked it this time . '
what did i have to do with it ?
one minute he' s pissin ' , next he' s dead .
' don' t even move . '
i' il phone the office now .

she told me , " don' t go .
i don' t want you on that highway alone .
i said , " it' il be fine , mom .
it' il be ok . " but it' s not , is it ?
i' m dead .
well , you' re not dead .
you would have been dead if i hadn' t saved your life .
would you rather it was you back there ?
i didn' t think so .
are you gonna kill me ?
depends on too many variables to answer .
are you gonna rape me ?
that' s not likely , no .
well , what do you want ?
i suspect the same thing as the other guy .
the pistol .
the one that jerry' s havin ' a hard time coming back from mexico with .
jerry ?
i work for bernie nayman , who works for arnold margolese .
you heard of these people .
yeah , i have .
and your husband works for ' em .
no .
well , he does .
i know the selfish , no good liar works for them .
he isn' t my husband .
well , whatever he is to you , jerry is in the shit books .
when you' re in as much shit as he is , you get skittish about your future .
clouds your judgement .
there' s a lot of people interested in that gun .
so what we got here is a ...
he who controls the girl , controls the pistol " situation .
i' m a hostage ?
you blew that guy to pieces for a fucking gun ?
this is so jerry .
look ...
sit down .
sit down .
um ...
uh , uh ...
look .
jerry and i broke up , so if he' s doing ...
i don' t know what he' s doing .
it' s got nothing to do with me .
you seem like a very nice girl .
thank you .
but it' s a fact , in these life threatening situations , human beings ... lie .
so you are gonna kill me .
all right , look .
if everything goes ok and jerry comes through without this getting funky ,
i don' t think that' il happen .
he gives me the pistol , i give you to him .
i' m just here to regulate funkiness .
ok ?
go on .
great .
hyah .
hyah !
hyah !
come on , buddy .
come on , ok ?
just you and me .
yeah .
go !
go .
oh !
you' re such an ass .

no , no , no !
i' m sorry !
i didn' t mean ...
fuck !

hey !

' i have a collect call for samantha from jerry welbach .
' no one there , sir . '
' give it a second . '
sam , pick up the phone .
sams ?
samsonite ?
baby , please don' t do this .
' please try again , sir ' no !
just give it a second .
she' s there ...
what are you doing ?
you' re gonna make a call .
to whom ?
to jerry .
you' re gonna tell him that leroy is with you then you hang up .
leroy ?
yeah .
leroy , that' s right .
then you' re gonna hang up .
simple .
that' s it ?
it' s enough .
believe me .
you gonna make the call or do i have to make you ?
cos i will .
no .
i' il call .
good .
dial it .
ok .
what' s the number ?
you have the number .
i don' t know where he is .
you should have the number .
what are you tellin ' me ?
you don' t have a number , a motel , nothing ?
what' s the matter , don' t you listen ?
we broke up .
no longer together .
why would i have the number ?
i' m sensing you have trust issues .
you got one minute .
i' m a professional .
i do this for a living .
goody for you .
you' re wasting your time .
# you' re nobody till somebody loves you ... #
i think i believe you .
# you' re nobody till somebody cares ...
what' s in vegas ?
uh , well ... i' m gonna be a waitress , then make a career as a croupier .
they can make $100, 000 a year but you have to have the hands , which i do .
i got them from grandma vega , which is a good thing cos my granny barzel had hands like a circus midget .
how come you can' t live with jerry ?
do you know jerry ?
he has trouble expressing feelings .
he had a fucked up childhood .
his mom is nuts .
one of those people who thinks the iron is always on .
don' t you love him ?
i think that' s the problem .
we love each other too much .
but he' s ...
he' s so selfish .
it' s like we' ve been living his life forever .
he' d tell you a different story , but i give and he just keeps taking .
our counsellor totally agrees with me , by the way .
i don' t put much stock in those counsellor types .
all they do is sit around and smoke joints .
maybe , but jerry is still a taker and i' m a giver .
it' s obvious .
a lot of people are under the impression that you get to choose who you love .
i' m sorry , are you ...
are you taking his side ?
you' re a man , of course .
you' re taking his side .
you love him .
you said so yourself .
it' s all that matters .
you' re a very sensitive person for a killer .
thank you , sam .
shit .
get .
get out .
out .
look , you gotta get out .
get out !
go !
hola , shithead !
where' s my stuff ?
get back !
where' s my stuff ?
pistol .
pistolero .
get back .
la pistola .
get back !
stay calm .
get back , get back !
don' t move .
what the f ... ?
give me those .
back !
back , back .
get in the car .
get in !
ok .
is that my ... ?
is that my jacket ?
put it in the car !
what is wrong with you people ?
get back !
you don' t have to be in here .
i go by track record .
i don' t hear any tinkle , tinkle .
stage fright .
look around , there' s not even a window .
so what' s with this " we' ve been livin ' his life forever " thing ?
i didn' t mean it literally .
jerry' s been working for margolese for five years less a day .
it just feels lifelong .
sounds like jail terms .
it is .
arnold margolese is in jail because jerry put him there .
jerry ratted out arnold margolese ?
no .
jerry was coming across ventura , over there by laurel canyon .
yeah ?
he wasn' t paying attention , ran a red light , smashed into margolese' s cadillac .
when the cops came , margolese got busted cos he had a person in the trunk .
that' s how margolese got sent to jail ??
mm hmm .
live person or dead person ?
live person .
huh .
what' s the big deal , then ?
he probably wasn' t gonna stay that way .
he was taped up in a trunk for a reason , wasn' t he ?
i would think this was right up your alley , swifty .
he saw something ?
whatever it was this guy saw , or was going to say to the cops , he got the chance .
since it was jerry' s fault , margolese had him work off the jail time .
my whole relationship has been hijacked because he doesn' t pay attention when he drives .
i ...
i can' t go with you in here .
we didn' t think we were getting a dead man with the car .
i got no use for a dead gringo .
take a left .
come on .
if you' re going to kill me , at least tell me who it is that' s going to send me to god .
tell me !
look , i' m not gonna kill you .
but i am gonna have to shoot you .
but why , sir ?
why ?
why ?
because you stole from me , you know about the pistol and you' il steal again .
i can' t have you coming back like a fly in the ointment .
i won' t be a fly !
you' il never see me again .
you' re gettin ' shot , that' s it .
it' il take time to walk to town , especially limping ...
wait , wait .
limping ?
can' t you just tie me up some more ?
fuck !
you shoot me ?
tie me !
yeah .
i don' t have a rope .
so you shoot me ?
it' s the american way .
where do you want it ?
ok .
not the leg !
there' s arteries .
i could bleed to death in seconds .
the foot .
that' s fair where i come from .
ok ?
it' il hurt , but it' il heal .
what if you take off a fucking toe !
wait , wait , wait .
not the left .
oh , sorry .
on the count of three .
one ...
look , i' m agreeing with you .
but there' s a few ways to look at it .
sex is , no matter what anybody says , a very important part of any relationship .
the fact that jerry is a considerate lover says a lot .
you lost me .
well , he' s a considerate lover .
you gotta find a way to get him to expand this quality he has during sex to other areas of your relationship .
even if it only comes out in sex , it' s there just the same .
that' s a good point .
if a person' s a considerate lover , he can' t be all selfish , right ?
unless of course he' s ...
he' s , uh , being a considerate ...
what was that ?
what ?
that .
that moment you had .
what moment ?
leroy , you just checked out that guy and had a moment .
that was a moment .
i don' t know if it was a moment .
as in happy ?
as in homosexual .
what does my sexual orientation have to do with our conversation ?
nothing .
nothing .
except something that you said back there really bugged me and this would kind of help it make sense .
yeah ?
what' s that ?
i asked if you were gonna rape me , you said , " not likely .
you said it so coldly , like i was repulsive and it was ludicrous to think i was actually at risk of being raped .
first of all , it' s a crime of anger , not attraction .
second of all , you' re not repulsive .
you' re very beautiful .
thank you .
you want me to rape you ?
are you gay ?
you want me to rape you ?
you' re gay .
you' re gay .
i knew it !
oh , i so knew it .
i just knew it .
what a relief .
do you want a medal ??
a little trinket saying you identified a homosexual ??
no .
are you full throttle ?
full throttle ?
yeah , i guess i am .
oh .
i' m not ...
i mean ...
i' m not trying to be a smart ass or anything like that .
i just ...
i think this is great .
wow .
this is ...
this is ... major , ok ?
i ... know the kind of people in your business , ok ?
yeah ?
and to me , it seems that ...
well , being gay isn' t really ... conducive to the environment .
like i should be an interior decorator .
that' s insulting .
i am very good at what i do .
do you have a boyfriend ?
no , i don' t .
unfortunately , i seem to be unable to keep ... relationships together .
seems like everybody' s having trouble keeping relationships together .
it' s ringing , senor .
thank you for that .
no , no , no .
no necesario .
really ?
that' s so kind .
you have no idea what ...
' hi , this is ted .
leave a message .
' if this is my guy in need , i' m on my way .
' go to the hotel de la plaza .
wait for me there , ok ?
sit tight . '
ok , ok .
forget aeropuerto .
uh , hotel de la plaza .
hola .
is this your dog ?
sort of .
came along for the ride .
he has a personality and that does count .
he' s a good guy .
is this your car ?
it' s a rental .
i' m an american .
no shit ?
really ?
yeah .
i' m mexican .
cool .
do you have a passport ?
jerry wellbatch , los angeles , usa .
welbach ...
wellbatch .
can i ask you a question , jerry ?
how long have you been in mexico ?
a few days .
pleasure .
i see .
pleasure , huh ?
yeah .
i see .
can you tell me , uh , what happened here ?
that' s not accurate , i' m afraid .
the gunsmith did craft this pistol for a prospective husband , and he was a nobleman' s son , true .
but the motif was darker , my friend .
it' s cursed , this gun .
' the key to this tale involves the gunsmith' s assistant , ' a poor , but honourable young man in blinding love
' with the gunsmith' s daughter .
' for months at a time , the assistant took to the mines
' gathering the precious metal
' that would yield the most beautiful gun that ever existed ,
' only to discover that what he hoped could be a wedding gift for him ... ' was for another .
' the gunsmith insisted his daughter marry the nobleman' s son ,
' forbidding their love .
' angered in his bitter pain , the assistant cursed the gun ,
' vowing the creation would never prevail .
' but the gunsmith was racing against time .
' he had promised a pistol of unparalleled craftsmanship ,
' the nobleman' s dowry hanging in the balance .
' he worked day and night to correct the pistol' s problems . '
this gun never worked properly .
some say its very creation ended the gunsmith' s life .
well , my friend , you' re free to go , but without the gun .
this gun doesn' t belong to you or to your boss .
now it belongs to me .
yeah , vegas .
it can be tough that way .
expensive ?
yeah , emotionally .
i had a serious relationship problem .
well , you fit right in here .
what do you do now , frank ?
now ... i am a postman .
get out of here .
that' s so rigid .
swear to god .
there' s a seedy underbelly to the postal service .
is that the key to it ?
that' s the key .
you have no idea how many small , unmarked brown paper packages i deliver .
what , porno ?
yeah , daily .
like what ?
videos , blow up dolls , dildos , pocket pussies .
don' t leave nothing out .
oh , yeah ?
but even with all that dirty excitement at my fingertips ,
i still have to take off once a year .
i just get up and i know i' m going to vegas , i just don' t know how .
all i' ve got is my wallet and an attitude .
i don' t know , it keeps me sane .
after all , guns don' t kill people ... postal workers do .
ok , you' re all set , mr shurker .
if you go to the front , a shuttle will pick you up .
what kind of car is it exactly ?
it' s a chrysler , sir , brand new .
you wouldn' t happen to have something a little more ...
raoul !
yeah , man !
yeah .
never fear , teddy' s here .
how are you ?
' rosco ! '
come on , jerry .
the mexican thief , the dirty cop ?
the word is out .
it' s a big ticket item .
a lot of fucking people are interested in that gun .
no fucking ...
is that what they think ?
that i' m selling them out ?
maybe they think you' re scared and might do the wrong thing .
ted .
you know , i don' t know .
i' m just doing my portion here .
yeah , and what is that ?
to find out what' s going on , assess the damage , try to calm you down , help find the pistol , get us home .
i get on that plane , pistol or not . it' il be the last flight i ever take .
oh , come on , jerry .
" come on " ?
you know it .
i know what i have to know .
doing your part .
i know what i have to know .
you sound like schultz from hogan' s heroes .
i know nothing !
i don' t like nayman running things either .
i got a few years on you and i' m telling you , keep your nose clean ,
look straight ahead and do what you' re told .
that' s why i nearly paid off boca raton .
i do my fuckin ' portions .
i don' t care how you look at it , the first step out of this is to get the pistol back .
i never took a pay off in my life .
jerry , look , i know where your loyalties lie .
but the kid' s dead .
the pistol' s gone .
i mean , you can see how it looks , right ?
come on .
you' re my guy .
# we can dance if we want to we' ve got all your life and mine
# as long as we abuse it , never gonna lose it
# everything will work out right
# i say , we can dance if we want to
# we can leave your friends behind
# cos your friends don' t dance and if they don' t dance , well they' re
# no friends of mine
# i say , we can dance , we can dance , everything' s out of control
# we can dance , we can dance
# they' re doing it from pole to pole
# we can dance , we can dance , everybody look at your hands ... #
not the safest dance !
i' m not going anywhere .
we are in the city where i' m going to be living .
go .
what' s wrong ?
huh ?
you know when you' re in a bad relationship and you separate ?
all of a sudden , everywhere you look there' s love and possibility .
i' m worried about jerry .
all right , don' t worry .
i' il call nayman and check in on everything .
you want me to stay ?
i want you to go .
you sure ?
i really want you to go .
i couldn' t sleep all night .
yeah .
no , he said he followed the cop to the pawn shop .
he' s taking me over there after breakfast .
we' re booked on the seven o' clock if all goes well .
no , now wait ...
no ...
no , you wait a minute , nayman .
now what do you gotta go and say that for ?
well , now or later ?
how could i misinterpret ?
no , you didn' t send the wrong guy .
i' m handling things .
but i never signed up for that .
listen , i promise you , when i tell him , it' il make a difference .
bye .
hey , sweets .
i keep calling and i haven' t heard a word from you .
i' m starting to wonder .
i know you' re angry with me , but , uh ...
you know , " ain' t no sunshine when she' s gone " .
ok ?
i think she actually went to vegas .
i keep telling you , these women are problems , you know ?
you should try to be like me i answer to myself .
no hassles , nobody ridin ' my ass like a goddamn horse in a saddle .
free .
you close yourself off so you have no shot at meeting the right woman .
any woman can be the right woman if the numbers work .
no way .
not me .
you settle .
you open yourself up .
you become vulnerable .
what' s the insight into my relationship ?
ok , look , jerry .
she is in vegas .
what ?
hey , shit falls down , you know ?
shit falls down ?
margolese called nayman all pissed off cos you were fucking this up , told him to keep an eye on sam in case ...
in case i get any funny ideas .
you' re just telling me this now ?
there' s other things to consider .
like what ?
that gun' s worth a lot .
people know you have it .
sam could be in danger .
no shit .
who did they put on her ?
you don' t know him , but you know of him .
who ?
that fucking psycho leroy .
leroy !
nayman had to .
it was an order .
margolese would know if he didn' t .
wait .
they' re just trying to scare me .
well , that would sure do it for me .
we' ve all heard the kidney story , jerry .
nayman wants us on that seven o' clock flight , pistol in tow .
no buts .
they' il meet us at the airport and then leroy will take the pistol .
yeah .
i had to borrow ...
do you mind ?
sleep well ?? !
yeah .
you ?
who' s winston ?
somebody i don' t like very much .
you can have that removed , you know ?
yeah , maybe i will someday .
you wanna get some breakfast ?
why can' t we be friends ? " )
# i' ve seen you round for a long , long time
# i really remember you when you drank my wine
# why can' t we be friends ?
why can' t we be friends ?
# why can' t we be friends ?
why can' t we be friends ?
# i seen you walking down in chinatown
# i called you but you could not look around
# why can' t we be friends ?
why can' t we be friends ?
# why can' t we be friends ?
why can' t we be friends ? #
at first , i thought this guy is all right .
and then i' m thinking he' s more than all right , he' s terrific .
but there' s no way he' s gonna feel the same way about me .
then i find out he does .
then i' m thinking ... what happens when he finds out what i do ... and who i am and what i' ve done ?
you know , who am i kidding , right ?
let' s get serious .
what are you gonna do about it ?
that' s it .
i didn' t have to do anything .
it happened absent of my will to consciously make it happen .
oh , really ?
i was a little drunk last night .
i took my gun and i put it in the towels in the bathroom , you know ?
and he found it .
and he said , " the past doesn' t matter .
it' s the future that counts .
leroy .
see , life can change .
people can change .
i haven' t cried in 12 years .
what are you lookin ' at ?
don' t look at me like that .
you' re makin ' it worse .
what are you , barbara walters ?
it' s just beautiful .
let' s talk about somethin ' else .
what do you wanna talk about ?
anything .
anything else .
whatever .
what was it over , the last time you cried ?
let' s talk about that .
oh , yeah , that' il bring the sun right out
i heard it was this guy leroy' s mother .
ok , that' s what we call bullshit .
if i told one guy at the next convention that you kept your mother cut up in the freezer , you' d have a reputation too .
fact or not , it makes no difference .
the guy' s a star .
oh , my god .
why are you so worried then if you think it' s bullshit ?
i met leroy once .
it was for all of two seconds .
i shook his hand .
he seemed like a nice guy .
whether or not he lives up to his legend isn' t the point .
or if he sits in his garage soaked in gasoline lighting matches ,
i don' t care .
what concerns me is he was hired in the first place .
are you with me ?
geez , jerry , you really met him ?
oh , my god !
ted is not gonna let anything happen , ok ?
i' m here .
thanks , ted .
i feel real safe .
hola .
i no fuck around , comprende ?
gun , gun , loaded .
bang , bang .
you , dead .
do you have a speech impediment ?
give me the gun .
the pistol .
the pistol ??
you know what i' m talkin ' about .
the pistol ??
ok , what' s your name ?
joe .
joe , do what he says and we' il be out of here before you know it .
the pistol , please .
ok .
thank you .
excuse me .
come on .
go .
got it .
just have a seat right here , amigo .
jerry !
have you lost your mind ?
what were you talking about on the phone ?
put the gun away .
was it to off me ?
is that what you two were discussing ?
jerry , i would never ...
go ahead , deny it !
go ahead .
go ahead !
ok , ok .
jerry , that' s what he said .
so you were lying when you said i' d walk away from this ?
no , jerry , that' s what he said .
then you' re lying to me now .
no , no .
nayman told me to do it , jerry , but ...
but ?
but ...
but you' re just doing your portion .
isn' t that how it works ?
17 portions left for boca ...
boca raton , right ?
i wouldn' t do that .
come on , i swear !
they tell you to bring me in , then they tell you to take me out .
why are you being told two contradicting things ?
you don' t ask a question ?
i i just ...
i ...
i don' t know .
you don' t think it' s weird ?
yeah , it' s ...
it' s weird .
right !
because something' s going on .
what is it ?
exactly .
you don' t know , you' re just doing your fucking part .
well , i' m not going down because you don' t know !
you see my predicament ?
you' re my guy , ted .
you' re my guy , jerry .
wait .
what happened here ?
someone killed themselves .
swan dived off the balcony .
let' s go .
stay back .
nothin ' to see here .
walk on .
thank you very much .
sorry to have disturbed you .
hotel security .
no .
please , no .
no .
no .
coming .
sir , there' s been a terrible incident .
are all parties in your room accounted for ?
yeah .
yeah .
just me and my wife .
honey !
no , that' s ok , sir .
thank you .
what happened ?
sorry to disturb you .
everything all right ?
leroy ...

shh , shh .
psst .
you' re a stupid motherfucker , you know that ?
you' re well dressed , i' il give you that , but stupid .

huh ?
yeah .
leroy .
please don' t do this .
please .
you think i should listen to her ?
huh ?
what do you think ?
huh ?
wanna know what i think ?
kevlar is for pussies .
this is for frank .
my bag will make the flight ?
they' il run it down .
i just need to see your passport .
yeah .
i' m afraid there' s been a mistake .
what ?
no !
no !
mr shurker most probably has yours .
i told you , if jerry makes it and nothing gets funky , it' il be ok .
well , shit got funky .
why isn' t he here ?
why ?
why ?
give me a second , i' m trying to get the story here .
take it easy and stop acting like a kidnapped chick on a carton of milk .
hmm .
yeah , you' re right .
this is an offer for the gun .
yeah .
i can see how this looks .
i' ve just been trying to get some better numbers together .
you have no intention of giving the gun to margolese .
look , bobby .
you know , i know that you' re loyal .
that' s good .
i mean , nobody' s debating that .
let me ask you , in your skulking around , going through private things in people' s offices , did you discover that he' s shutting us down ?
that' s right .
you , me , everybody .
i don' t ...
i don' t understand .
what , you didn' t get the memo , the bonus ?
no ?
no .
nothing .
me neither .
difference is i know when i' m being fucked and you don' t , cos you' re standing on the wrong fucking line .
let me help you get on the right side of the line and do for you what he should' ve done , bobby .
he' s changed in prison .
i' m telling you , something' s changed him .
he' s not the same guy .
they' re still holding .
what shall i tell ' em ?
can i count on your co operation ?
yeah , yeah , bobby .
i' m here .
yeah .
yeah , that' s his hotel .
yeah , all right .
sure .
what ?
plan b is now in effect .
i hope you don' t get airsick .
get in the car .
hola , senor .
hola , senor welbach .
has the us consulate called back yet ?
no , sir , not yet .
look , this is a muy , muy important call .
i' ve lost my passport , ok ?
i' il be sitting right there .
i' m not gonna move .
do you see that man over there ?
yeah .
that' s mr williamson .
so ?
he' s been waiting for that very same call .
really ?
what , the whole morning ?
since march , senor .
oh , come on !
hotel de la plaza .
yes , as a matter of fact , he' s right here .
senor , it' s for you .
oh .
oh .
hey .
yes , hello ?
you bastard .
hello ?
like , " hello , my life is great .
everything is fine .
sam ?
' i thought you could be dead . '
i was worried sick and you answer " hello ,
like you' re confirming a room service order ? !
sam ?
sam ?
i' m done with mr jerry welbach .
mr " hi " .
no , no .
' ask about the gun . '
is that leroy ?
' did he fucking touch you ? '
do you have any idea what i have just been through ?
multiply it by 1, 000 and you' il have a vague conception of where i' m at .
oh !
oh , isn' t that typical , jerry ?
it' s all a competition !
tit for tat , tat for tit ...
stop yelling , for christ' s sake !
how are you ?
are you ok ?
are you all right ?
' where are you ? '
toluca airport , jerry .
and things are shitty , really shitty !
tell him if he shows up with the pistol , it' il be ok .
' he doesn' t care .
he only cares about himself . '
why are you airing personal matters with strangers ?
oh , let me see .
uh , i don' t think that you really classify someone who you just perpetrated a killing with a fucking stranger !
and i can' t find my kotex cards or my credit cards ...
sam , what did you say ?
jerry , just settle down .
what' d you do to her ?
jerry , just settle down .
ok ?
yeah .
we had a situation but i' m a professional and i know what i' m doing .
so why don' t we chill out a minute here ?
' now , what happened ?
you get lost ? '
yeah , five years ago .
what did you ... ?
i can' t hear you .
no , nothing .
nothing .
nothing .
i hope you have something .
yeah , you just ...
you don' t ...
make sure you return her with all ten toes .
huh ?
' i understand .
i understand . '
' just come down here , pick us up .
we' il square things away . '
you got a very special woman here .
but we all know how you can get , right ?
' so none of that . '
what ?
this is a time for selflessness .
what ?
wha ... ?
you all right ?
yeah , come on .
stupid gun .
out !
i have to ask you a question .
and it' s an important one so i want you to think about the answer before you give it to me , ok ?
ok .
when two people really love each other but they can' t get it together , when do you get to that point where enough is enough ?
that ...
oh , well , that' s ...
you know ?
um , you know it' s over when ...
ok , i have , like , these psychosomatic insomniatic manifestations of ...
well , here' s the thing about me .
i' m a product of my emotions , not a product of my environment , like him , which he is , exactly , just that environmental ...
i i need sunshine to grow .
that' s who i am .
and with the projection of ...
i have goals .
that' s your answer ?
yeah .
that' s not right .
i mean , there' s a right answer here , but that' s not it .
look , in my business you' re surrounded ... by loneliness and finality .
i don' t care what your take is on an afterlife , when people die , it' s scary , and they go alone .
now , the people that i send off , that have experienced love ...
they' re a little less scared .
they' re still scared , but there' s a calmness to ' em .
i think that comes from the knowledge that somebody somewhere loved ' em and cared for ' em and will miss ' em .
now , i see that from time to time and i am awed by it .
i don' t think i' d be telling you this if it wasn' t for frank .
anyway , it' s a loaded question .
look , when two people love each other , totally , truthfully , all the way love each other , the answer to that question is simple , especially in your case .
when do you get to that point where enough is enough ?
never .
never .
i just hope jerry' s not stupid .
what is he driving ? !
it' s a funky rental .
i know we' re all a little grouchy right now .
we' il get something to eat , you' il get the pistol and then we' il go our separate ways .
really separate ways .
don' t start .
shut up .
i' il start because i have the ...
why do you do that ?
do not tell me to shut up .
i count .
we had an agreement .
shut up .
why don' t we all shut up a bit ?
i swear , i will crash this car .
jerry , don' t do that .
i will .
one more word out of you .
another word , sam .
one more word .
i swear to fucking god .
naugahyde .
all right .
jerry !
you finished ?
yes !
you gonna shut up ?
yes , yes , yes !
jerry , i will , i will !
stop the car , jerry !
stop the car .
stop , stop , stop !
oh , my god !
pendejo !
jerry ... i want you to know , you' re the craziest fuck i ever met .
you know what ?
go !
go to vegas .
i' ve had it !
son of a bitch !
i had a flat down in florida once .
out in the middle of nowhere .
so i go to the trunk , there' s no spare .
four hours in the baking sun , waiting for a truck to come by .
ow !
now i always check .
let me give it a rip .
sometimes you need a little more torque , you know what i mean ?
wouldn' t kill the bastards to oil these every once in a while .
fucking car rentals .
yeah .
walk away , baby .
what did you do ?
he was gonna kill us .
what the fuck did you do ?
look at his head !
stop !
stop !
listen , listen .
i met leroy in 1997 .
and that' s not him !
no , no , jerry .
you made a terrible mistake .
he was my friend !
you made a terrible mistake !
baby , leroy is black .
leroy' s black .
ok ?
no .
yes !
he' s black .
no .
african american .
a person of colour .
the guy he killed in vegas is leroy .
that' s margolese' s leroy .
so , this guy ...
oh , i' m such an ass .
such an ass .
of course .
give the gun to leroy .
he' il get it down to margolese . " ha fuckin ' ha !
you see ?
do you see ?
i' m being set up !
nayman hires this prick to take out leroy , get the gun and pin it all on jack off jerry .
isn' t that right , mr winston baldry ?
i met leroy and there' s no way you could have known that .
and that' s your mistake .
you fucked up .
i can' t believe it .
every fucking time .
every fucking time , i fuck up .
not this time .
this time , i win .
this time , i win !
i fucking win !
i win !
oh , my god .
i' m lucky i didn' t lose you three days ago .
i wanna go home .
did you call about your passport ?
did you call the consulate ?
yeah .
do you have enough money ?
yeah , i' m all right .
i wanna ask you a question .
it' s a good one , so think about it .
if two people love each other ... but they just can' t seem to get it together ...
when do you get to that point of enough is enough ?
never .
they' il call .
i' ve left 60 messages .
i said it was an emergency .
why would nayman ask you if you like sex and travel ??
w w what is it supposed to mean ?
that you fool around or something ?
is that ...
i tell you the whole , long debacle and this you have a problem with ?
yeah , i do .
i think that when you ask someone who is involved in a relationship of the heart if they like sex and travel , that ... that' s m m mean spirited .
it' s stupid .
i' il tell you this , we' re not running any more , no .
no , no .
so done with the running .
the packing and the running and ...
sooner or later , that phone is gonna ring .
we are going to get your passport in order and you are gonna give the gun to margolese .
nayman is fucking margolese .
that has nothing to do with us .
by the grace of god , i don' t know what , you have managed to forrest gump your way through this .
and just , if we run now ... we' re gonna be running the rest of our lives .
we want our life back .
yes , baby , we do .
no , that can' t be right .
can you just check again ?
ow !
baby , don' t .
margolese .
m as in mary .
baby , can you turn that down ?
you don' t even speak spanish .
real emotion transcends language , jerry .
you don' t have to understand to hear their pain .
no , that' s impossible .
that' s ...
do you know when ?
ay yi yi !
no , no , all right .
all right .
margolese is out .
he got out this morning .
he' s out .
what' s going on ?
he' s not due out till thursday .
it is thursday , hon .
what is it ?
shh .
come on .
just stay away from the window .
shit .
shit .
here , give me it .
good one .
what is it , boy ?
hey !
get out of there .
come on , man .
you' re freaking me out .
huh ?
ow .
where are you taking me ?
it' s not your fault you know nothing about this gun .
you' re american .
this gun does not belong to you .
mr margolese .
well , i i ...
i don' t understand .
what' s it gonna take , jerry ?
what ?
for the gun , jerry .
what' s it gonna take for you to give it to me and not to another ?
you ...
man !
what' il it take ?
i don' t know what it takes .
i' m new in the " fuck you " business .
you tell me , what does it take ?
i didn' t fuck you , jerry .
i had nayman send you down here , but i didn' t know he was looking for a buyer .
when i found out he was , i didn' t know who on my team was ... still on my team , or even if there was a damn team .
who ... ?
who the fuck are these guys ?
they work for this man , tropillo .
and who the fuck is trop ... ?
you know ?
not important .
give me a good reason why i shouldn' t fight to not give you the gun .
if it comes to that , someone will leave here missing an ear or not being able to fuck any more .
one reason , now that you let me know what you think i' m made of .
are you a fatalist , jerry ?
uh , i never really thought about it .
por favor ...
gracias .
when you do think about it , about that afternoon you smashed into my life , into my car , ever think there' s anything to that ?
i honestly never thought about it .
because of that afternoon ,
i' m doomed to remember a backwards inmate with a paper clipping .
when you' re in jail , a small box ... you learn a lot about the fella you' re in a cage with .
i grew to love that boy , like he was my own son .
but he was his .
one day the boy came to me with a clipping .
this is my destiny .
this is my birthright .
it was a story about the pistol ... how they found it in the mines , stashed away .
when i asked why it meant so much to him , the story he told changed my life .
' the night before the nobleman' s arrival ,
' the assistant could not sleep ... his heart in aching pain . '
' the day was here when the gunsmith would present
' his gift to the nobleman .
' the nobleman' s son was a notoriously vicious soldier ,
' worldly and wicked .
' for him , his father demanded something more beautiful ,
' more perfect than he' d ever laid eyes on before .
' but nothing , no words or description could have given justice to it ...
' or have prepared him for that gun' s flawless grace .
' when the nobleman' s son saw his intended bride to be ...
' it was love at first sight .
' the nobleman' s son took the mighty weapon into his hands .
' a perfect fit . '
' it did not work .
' the nobleman took it as a bad omen .
' the curse had rendered it useless in unworthy hands .
' the gunsmith urged him to try it one last time , and so he did . '
' the nobleman was insulted by the ineptness , angry with the gunsmith .
' they argued .
' when he realised that her heart belonged to the simple assistant ,
' a man far less than he , he was furious in anger .
' he could not have that .
' the assistant , realising that even if the gun should work ,
' she would certainly die next , begged his love to withdraw
' and accept their fate . '
' some say you could actually hear her heart break .
' she fearlessly surrendered her bitter spirit unto purgatory . '
' the pistol contains her damned soul . '
day after day i listened to that story and always he' d tell me ,
when i get out , i will find that pistol and return it to my father ,
whose father' s father had crafted the gun .
eighteen months later , he took it in the belly for me .
he died .
i vowed to search , acquire the pistol and return it to his father .
my grandson , beck , headstrong boy ...
sure , he was mixed up , he didn' t understand the honour behind what i was doing .
that' s when it became clear i had to send you down here .
because you were the instrument in the situation , jerry .
his son is dead .
my grandson is dead .
all of it brought together by that afternoon at our intersection .
well , that ... that' s a pretty good fucking reason .
usted es un soldado de dios .
you are a soldier of god .
she will be safe there , right there , and she can fly with the angels .
no devils can catch her here , right here , and now she will be able to fly with the angels .
we square ?
i' il owe you .
jerry , honey ?
' i bet this is the queen of the idiot ?
' this must be sam .
this is bernie nayman .
' where' s that stupid fucking jerry ?
with leroy ? '
don' t you mean winston ?
i hope not , cos he' s dead .
' then you' re in a lot of trouble .
' especially if jerry sold that gun . '
jerry hid it .
' a step in the right direction .
' are you there , sam ? '
yeah , i' m here .
yeah , me too .
nayman !
what have you done with her ?
sam ?
don' t shoot .
she' s in the trunk .
i swear , if you hurt ...
it is hot in there .
let her out !
give me the pistol and i will .
all right .
all right , nayman , where are the keys ?
i might have lost them .
well , you' re out of luck .
she' s the one who hid the pistol .
oh .
sam , no !
put it down .
you' il damage it .
shut the fuck up !
sam , do not , i repeat , do not pull that trigger .
no .
i ...
i will pull this fucking trigger .
you toast that gun , he' s dead right after .
sweets .
put the gun down .
ok ?
put it down .
i' m not worth it .
ok ?
he' s right , it' s not worth it .
don' t you know when enough is enough ?
baby .
do you like sex and travel ??
as a matter of fact , i do .
wrong answer .
sweetheart ?
