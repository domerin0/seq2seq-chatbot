piedmont , new mexico .
population 68 .
come on .
i didn' t notice them before .
that' s crazy .
i didn' t know buzzards fly at night .
that' s what they look like .
here .
boy , that' s some dead burg .
buzzards only come when something' s dead .
well , i guess we better go in and have a look .
this is caper one to vandal deca .
caper one to vandal deca .
are you reading ?
over .
yes , i' m reading .
over .
we' re about to enter the town of piedmont and recover the satellite .
very good , caper one .
leave your radio open .
roger .
we' re now inside the town .
it' s kinda spooky .
i see a church steeple ahead on the left .
it' s quiet here .
it' s the damndest thing .
there' s no sign oflife .
the signals from the satellite are getting very strong .
sir . !
you see that , lieutenant ?
see what , crane ?
over by the fence .
it looks like a body .
easy , crane .
you' re imagining things .
holy . !
sir , it' s another one .
you' re right .
it looks dead .
yes , sir , shall i ...
no . !
stay in the van .
vandal deca to caper one .
what' s happening ?
we see bodies , lots of them .
are you certain , caper one ?
damn it , comroe , of course we' re certain .
your orders are ... proceed to satellite and retrieve .
roger , vandal deca .
stay at your stations !
hit that security button !
get me major manchek .
somehow they don' t hardly look dead , lieutenant .
they' re all over the place .
must be dozens of them .
damn it , get this call through !
it' s sort of like they just dropped in their tracks , sir .
sir . !
good chri ... !
do you see that thing in white ?
yeah , it' s coming toward us .
major , this may sound crazy , but there' s something strange going on with caper one .
sir , i think we should get out of h ...
hello , ops , this is major manchek , scoop control a 12 .
we need a flyby over piedmont , new mexico .
infrared .
a fli r scan , all sectors .
film to come direct to scoop .
assign gunner wilson , if he' s not crocked someplace .
jeez !
i' m declaring a state of emergency .
all personnel restricted to base .
everything seen and heard in that room is top secret .
yes , sir .
this is a recording .
state your name and your message and hang up .
major arthur manchek , scoop mission control a 12 .
i recommend calling a wildfire alert .
we have evidence here on film of unnatural death caused by scoop 7 returning to earth .
time check 0 1 4 7 inclusive .
we' d like to see dr. jeremy stone , please .
well , i' m mrs. stone .
we are having a party .
may i ...
does that man have a gun ?
ma' am , we must see dr. stone .
what is this ?
please call dr. stone to the door .
otherwise we' il go get him .
just a minute .
i' il just wait here , ma' am .
i' il come to berkeley anytime , stone .
that $4 million must be your largest federal grant .
may i see you , jeremy ?
the s. d. s. has arrived no doubt .
jeremy , there are some army types in the hall and two more outside with guns .
they want to see you .
i' il take care of it .
jeremy !
if you knew about this , you might' ve told ...
i didn' t .
i' il explain later .
i' m dr. stone .
yes .
i' m captain morton .
there' s a fire , sir .
i' ve got to leave .
for god' s sakes , jeremy !
when will you be back ?
i' m not sure .
the guns , is it ...
mrs. stone , it' s ourjob to protect your husband .
from now on , nothing must be allowed to happen to him .
i' il be safe as in your arms .
jeremy ?
jeremy !
you tell the senator it' s his daughter !
allison ?
dad , something very peculiar has just happened , even forjeremy .
a few minutes ago ...
dad , are you there ?
what' s going on ?
this communication is being monitored .
the connection has been broken for reasons of national security .
you will be briefed at the appropriate time .
thank you for your cooperation , mrs. stone .
i feel like onassis .
it was the fastest thing we could arrange , sir .
thanks .
yes ?
general sparks here .
i just wanted to inform you ... that all members of your team have been cleared and are now being called in .
except for professor kirke .
he' s in the hospital .
appendectomy .
you' il get complete details on everything when your team is assembled .
you don' t make sense .
you talk like you' ve been brainwashed .
you don' t understand .
germ warfare people , dad ?
a lab accident ?
thank you .
it' s different this time .
don' t pack , claire , i won' t need anything .
a hippie .
he' s going to a love in .
i give up .
one minute you' re fed up .
you talk about retiring ... to alaska yet !
now you' ve turned into a cloak and dagger man .
my glasses .
here they are , dad .
can' t you at least tell me who phoned at this ungodly hour ?
grandpa , there' s a car , and they got guns .
do they now ?
well , that' s serious .
i' il watch out .
honey , you' ve been dreaming .
i wish i were !
no .
uh uh .
get someone else .
dr. leavitt , i told you , there' s a fire !
my experiment' s at the critical stage .
i' ve been working around the clock .
i can' t just leave now .
i want that new plate read as soon as it' s developed .
yes , ma' am .
my orders come from dr. robertson , the president' s science advisor in washington .
there' s a phone .
pick it up .
call robbie .
tell him i burnt my draft card .
are you sick , ma' am ?
we have a physician on call .
all dr. leavitt needs is rest .
knock it off , bess .
if the physician certifies that you are unable to continue ...
no !
i' m fine .
relax .
i' m going with you .
skin knife .
hold it , mark .
sorry to disturb you .
there' s just been a call from a dr. robertson at the white house .
your orders are to break scrub .
orders ?
i' ve got a patient all ready .
kelly will take over for you .
it' s all arranged .
you' re expected in the surgeon' s room in 30 seconds .
are you sure the satellite isn' t radioactive ?
no .
manchek showed me the telemetry reports .
presumably , it could be some form of space germ .
presumably this stuff is nonporous .
why did you pick me ?
you' re an m. d. , a talented surgeon who knows blood chemistries ... and you' re single ... the " odd man hypothesis .
what the hell is that ?
didn' t you read the wildfire material i' ve been sending you ?
very little .
i never went in much for science fiction .
nor do i !
it seems to me , general , dr. stone put one over on you .
in fact , he made us all think his wildfire lab could handle contamination from outer space .
i disagree with the senator from vermont .
dr. stone , a nobel prize winner , twice president of the national academy of sciences , is well known here in washington .
is the implication that dr. stone deliberately misled us ?
perhaps not deliberately , senator .
i' m reasonably certain that before the night the wildfire team was mobilized ,
dr. stone didn' t know scoop existed .
i' m astounded .
reasons of national security .
very smart .
we' ve had experiences with scientists before .
now , let' s talk about this famous letter ...
dr. stone sent to the president some two years ago .
from what you' re saying , it was just a shot in the dark ?
perhaps that' s a little unfair , senator .
dr. stone and i were consultants with nasa on the lunar receiving lab .
he wasn' t completely satisfied .
he felt a more advanced lab was required .
you mean more expensive , don' t you ?
i call that dr. stone' s $90 million mash note to uncle sam .
in a true biological crisis which our exploration of space could bring about ,
the present lunar receiving laboratory might prove inadequate .
i therefore urge the establishment of a facility ...
to deal specifically with an extraterrestrial form of life .
the purpose of this facility would be to limit ...
the dissemination of such an unknown organism from outer space ...
and to provide laboratories for its analysis .
i recommend that this facility be located ...
in an uninhabited region of the united states ,
that it utilize all known isolation techniques ,
and that it be equipped with a nuclear device for self destruction ...
in the event of an emergency .
yours very truly , jeremy stone .
don' t encourage the president to think scientists are wizards .
if things get out of control , and they might , even you can' t work miracles .
i' d expect to have your help , charlie .
piedmont approaching , gentlemen .
go over and give us a look first , dempsey .
i was afraid of that .
the birds' il eat the infected flesh , and then fly off and spread the disease .
if it is a disease .
drop the gas canisters .
someone' s supposed to be alive down there !
somebody did something .
that' s for sure .
let' s give it a double dose .
that gas will only kill the birds .
okay , dempsey , hover over the main street and drop the ladder .
do not attempt to land .
is that clear ?
roger .
clearer all the time .
when we climb down , lift off to 1, 000 feet and hover at a safe distance .
and come back when we signal .
if anything happens to us , you have your orders .
yes , sir .
proceed directly to wildfire and then ...
if we' re eliminated , the aircraft and pilot will have to be sterilized .
wait a minute !
that' s not what they told me .
just incinerated .
coronary ?
i doubt it .
hall . !
take a look at this .
are you sure that isn' t coronary ?
no , coronary' s painful .
they should grimace .
if it was fast , they wouldn' t have time .
fast ?
these people were cut down in mid stride .
up there !
look .
an air force jet .
if we don' t make it to wildfire , he' il see the helicopter does ... or shoot it down .
well , for dempsey' s sake , we better not slip up .
the day ofjudgment is at hand .
have mercy on my soul and to hell with all the others .
amen .
senile .
this took time !
regardless of what made her do it , it took time .
there' s a chance someone' s still alive .
i wouldn' t believe you could commit suicide that way .
most of them died instantly , but a few had time to go quietly nuts .
let' s find the damn satellite .
this injury , there isn' t any bleeding .
a cut like this ... torn veins , broken capillaries ... should bleed like hell .
yes .
well , there' s no blood on any of them .
even where it' s chewed , no bleeding .
hold it , hold it !
you' d better back up .
we gotta go to the ... left .
we' re damn close .
bear right .
i' il bet they took it to the doctor .
there it is .
the damn fool opened it . !
yeah , every country doctor should run his office like the lunar lab .
the capsule first , hall .
we' ve got about 40 minutes of oxygen left .
have a look at his buttocks .
that' s not funny .
not meant to be .
normally blood in a dead person goes to the lowest points .
there should be marks of lividity .
do you see purplish marks on his butt ?
no .
careful you don' t puncture your suit .
clotted blood !
powdered !
i' il be damned !
no wonder they didn' t bleed .
it' s clotted throughout the entire system .
five quarts of blood turned to powder !
in theory , i suppose , a single organism could do it .
but , in fact , there isn' t an organism on earth ...
you mean there didn' t used to be .
i don' t ...
we heard it all right .
go away !
go back !
get back !
get outta here .
go back !
get away . !
this must be the mother .
he' s scared , and hungry as hell .
can' t be more than six months .
there' s probably a formula in the kitchen .
don' t feed it !
he hasn' t eaten in at least 12 hours !
we don' t do anything until we get that kid into a controlled situation .
maybe feeding is part of the disease process .
maybe those who hadn' t eaten lasted longest .
whatever it is , with our oxygen running out , we can' t take a chance .
wait a minute .
this is a major break ... a survivor .
too bad he can' t tell us what happened .
maybe he can ... if he lives .
you . !
you ... you did it !
give me that knife .
you' re not human .
everybody' s dead .
what happened ?
what is it ?
what happened ?
the town is finished , contaminated beyond all ...
careful , sir .
this is an open transmission .
i' m aware of that , manchek .
order up a 7 12 .
only the president ...
precisely .
get on it .
the town must be neutralized immediately .
has the president made his decision on directive 7 12 yet ?
he doesn' t jump into things , dr. robertson .
first i' ve got to put together a briefing for him .
the president' s main concern is the international consequences .
what do you think , mr. secretary ?
it' s against the moscow treaty of 1963 ... to fire thermonuclear weapons above ground .
the russians will have to be privately informed we' re going to cauterize the area .
then they' il ask a flock of questions .
some we don' t want answered .
that' il take hours .
god knows how far the infection can spread in that time .
yes , chief ?
yes , sir .
yes , mr. president .
the president' s decided to postpone directive 7 12 for 24 to 48 hours .
instead he' il call out the national guard to cordon off the area around piedmont .
that' s your department , ed .
safe and sound .
it should' ve been left up to the scientists .
it' s a colossal mistake .
tell the president i said so .
no , but ...
i' il get you an appointment .
by whose decision , general , was the site for wildfire chosen ?
dr. stone' s .
it seemed ideal because of its remoteness .
there was no inhabited area near wildfire for a radius of 112 miles .
las vegas is to the north , phoenix to the south , los angeles west .
weren' t you worried the infection might spread to them ?
yes , sir , i was , but dr. stone and dr. robertson assured the president ...
wildfire was foolproof because of its device for atomic self destruct .
the military had to take a backseat .
at least they could' ve sent a licensed driver to meet me at that crummy airstrip .
they keep personnel to a minimum for obvious reasons .
you' re lost !
no one' s been down this goat path for years .
that' s how it' s supposed to look .
they spent $50, 000 on it .
putting in the potholes ?
getting rid of the tread marks .
those big tractors leave a lasting impression .
a lot of heavy equipment has passed this way .
where' s our leader ?
we' il catch up to him and hall very soon now .
why' d they pick hall ?
he' s no scientist .
who needs an overpriced m. d. ?
relax and enjoy your cigarette .
it' s your last .
it starts here .
it' s a great place to grow pot .
just a plain old crop of barley .
still , it is rather clever , i think .
something wrong ?
i never liked red lights .
reminds me of my years in a bordello .
howdy .
howdy do dee .
you got the time ?
my watch stopped at 11 : 46 .
darn shame .
must be the heat .
it' s no fake , believe me .
when i retire , i' d like an agricultural station like this in alaska .
you , a sourdough ?
hmph !
the sourest .
this way .
step in .
cute .
the whole thing , what a world we' re making .
i can see why the kids are dropping out .
we should' ve .
it' s an emergency , dutton .
we got tagged .
period .
until i saw those photos from vandenberg , i ...
they brought it on themselves .
who ?
the people in piedmont ?
what you said before , you don' t believe the infection in that capsule was brought back deliberately , do you ?
skip it .
i hope i' m talking through my hat .
put your hands on that glass , palms down .
it' s a finger and palm print analyzer .
it ...
reads a composite of 10, 000 dermatographic lines .
how' d you know that ?
oh , dutton , i have a long criminal record .
then you' re in trouble .
this machine has a long memory .
it gives you final clearance to enter wildfire .
isothermal reading for m. c. levels 4 and 5 ... is z. b. and r. a. over 2 . 9 .
how' s piedmont ?
i had to order up a 7 12 .
how are you , ruth ?
no other way to halt the infection spread .
oh .
oh , you two know each other , don' t you ?
by reputation only .
ah , yes , up to now we' ve had to worship from afar .
be good , ruth .
any messages for me from the white house ?
not a thing , dr. stone , or you' d have it .
no personal messages ?
no , ma' am .
nothing from dr. robertson ?
are you sure , sergeant ?
dr. stone , sir , i have one thing to do .
just one .
everything else is fully automatic , computerized and self regulating .
i ...
i listen for a little bell in here .
ding a ling .
that means a message coming in is for the wildfire team .
precisely !
an m. c. n. communication .
i' m expecting one .
yes , sir !
top priority .
ding a ling .
i push a button ... and all five level control centers are notified the same time you are .
the bell hasn' t rung , sir .
thanks for the tour , sergeant .
dr. dutton .
thank you .
will you follow me , dr. leavitt ?
and may i have your glasses , please ?
what for ?
they' il be treated and returned to you , doctor .
they better be , or i' il need a white cane .
who picked leavitt ?
talk about the odd man hypothesis , which we haven' t yet .
she' s really an oddball .
we' re lucky to have her .
she' s the best equipped of us to double up for kirke in microbiology .
when dressed , the team will proceed directly to conference room 7 .
keep this with you at all times .
what' s it for ?
you' re the odd man .
the key man , quite literally .
this other key , and wildfire itself , depend on your key .
wildfire' s equipped with a nuclear device for self destruct .
in an emergency , it' s activated automatically .
i' ve just inserted the key in the main station that arms the mechanism .
the device is ready for detonation .
when ?
never , we hope .
it only goes off if there' s danger of infection breaking out from here .
that silver key can' t be removed .
you' re the only one who can disarm the mechanism by inserting your red key ... in one of the substations located throughout the facility .
there' s a five minute delay between the time detonation locks in and the bomb explodes .
that gives you a chance to think ... and , please god , call it off .
look , i' m the new boy here .
why me ?
because you' re single .
you should have done your homework , sport .
page 255 , robbie' s odd man hypothesis .
that an unmarried male should carry out command decisions ... involving thermonuclear destruct contexts .
let me take a look at that .
it' s of vital importance ... that you always know where you are in relation to the nearest substation .
to do that , you have to be familiar with the entire facility .
it can be studied on this electronic diagram ... which rotates to afford an overall view , or can be stopped at any section .
detailed plans of the various levels and labs are also stored in the system .
we' re on level 1 of a five story cylindrical underground structure ... surrounded by solid rock .
each level has three substations , indicated by the yellow lights .
in the event the nuclear device is triggered , you can still cancel self destruct ... by inserting your red key in a substation .
after our last simulation run , we decided to add two more substations per level , but they' re not finished .
so don' t confuse them with functioning ones .
at the bottom of the central core is the apparatus for self destruct .
each level is a different color ... based on a navy study of the psychological effects of color in environments .
also , each level is biomedically cleaner than the one above it .
we don' t want anything to contaminate a possible organism .
that would make it twice as hard to isolate and characterize .
it' il take us 16 hours to descend ... through the programmed decontamination procedures on the first four levels ... to level 5 where the main labs are .
where , exactly , are we now ?
there' s one way you can always locate yourself or any of us instantly .
simply by calling up projections from the electronic diagram ... on any video monitor anywhere in wildfire .
views such as this .
this shows we' re in conference room 7 , level 1 .
each of us is indicated by our initial .
our movements are continuously monitored on the electronic diagram .
where are the patients ?
where' s the capsule ?
the patients are the yellow x' s .
the red circle is the capsule .
on level 5 , the patients and capsule will be isolated in biologically secure setups .
are you sure the old man and the baby are still alive ?
what are their chances , hall ?
uncertain .
i' m hoping the intravenous dextrose and saline will hold them until we get to them .
we start decontamination and immunization procedures now .
you really expect me to fire the thing ?
i' m afraid you don' t understand .
all you can do is stop it .
in a biological emergency , the bomb is activated automatically .
it' il then go off within five minutes unless you get to a substation ... and lock in your key .
oh .
delta five to all levels .
we are checking out ray ban emergency communications .
this is a test .
proceed to infrared radiation decontamination room 1 d.
also it could be an organism from another planet released deliberately .
to wipe us out ?
really , charles !
just the opposite .
to make friendly contact .
a kind of messenger to show us life exists elsewhere in the universe .
it could be benign in its own environment .
pretty far fetched .
we can' t ignore any possibility .
you are about to undergo long wave radiation .
a buzzer will sound .
close your eyes and stand still or blindness may result .
how to disinfect the human body , one of the dirtiest things in the known universe .
that is without killing the human being at the same time .
it gets tougher as we go .
hard on the taxpayers , the way we burn up uniforms .
they' re paper .
i' d swear it was cloth .
new process .
where' s the next substation , hall ?
left of elevator on level 2 .
right .
across the corridor from body analysis , our next port of call .
not for my alabaster body .
i mean it , stone .
you can take your body analyzer and you can ...
sit down , please .
please look at the screen in front of you .
please place your body so that all points are obliterated .
that is fine .
we may proceed .
state your name for the records .
surname first .
mark hall .
hall , mark .
thank you for your cooperation .
yes , dear .
please answer the following questions yes or no .
have you any allergies ?
yes , to ragweed pollen .
okay , i' il repeat for your memory cells ...
please repeat your response for our memory cells .
ragweed pollen !
this ends the formal questioning .
please undress .
this is a scan for fungal lesions .
dr. stone , this is level 2 control .
the answer is affirmative .
major manchek contacted the white house at 11 :: 23 this morning .
contact on all leads is " r" for ready .
do not be nervous .
i' m not nervous .
physical parameters are being measured .
there' s no need to be nervous , dr. leavitt .
please raise your left arm .
please sit up , facing the scan screen and watch carefully .
you have received pneumatic injections ofbooster immunizations .
you may get dressed .
thank you .
this recording is now ended .
that body analyzer !
i want to be there when the a. m. a. gets wind of it .
so far it' s only been used by nasa to diagnose astronauts in space .
you doctors better start making house calls again .
this is a xenon lamp apparatus .
to insure complete effectiveness , spread your feet apart .
to protect scalp and facial hair , place the metal helmet securely on the head .
make sure the helmet is firmly seated and the visor lowered .
then raise your arms and wait .
you may now remove helmet .
you will notice a fine white ash on your body .
this is the outer epithelial layers of your skin that have been burned away .
please replace the helmet in compartment and proceed through shower in next room .
then you may dress and descend to level 4 .
we' re required to rest for six hours on level 4 after exposure to the xenon lamp .
so go to your rooms and sleep .
at the end of the corridor is the cafeteria .
we' il meet there at 0400 hours ... tomorrow .

the pressure integrity check runs 2 . 54 g cm to the second .
please confirm .
a new form of life .
like rudolph karp' s bacteria .
fools !
they refuse to believe life exists in meteorites .
i showed them at the astrophysics conference what i just showed you .
but no , even with a microscope , they are blind .
what do i have to do ?
hit them over the head ?
i' m glad you' re amused , gentlemen , but it might just turn out to be true .
during this symposium , we' il discuss the possibility ... that intelligent life on a distant planet ... may be no larger than a flea .
perhaps no larger than a bacterium .
time to wake up , sir .
time to wake up , sir . !
hello ?
time to wake up , sir .
who are you ?
time to wake up , sir .
do you wish something , sir ?
your name .
will that be all , sir ?
for the moment .
this is the answering service supervisor .
we wish you would adopt a more serious attitude , dr. hall .
sorry .
her voice is quite luscious .
the voice belongs to miss gladys stevens who is 63 years old .
she lives in omaha and makes her living taping messages for voice reminder systems .
much obliged .
let' s not get sidetracked on rudolph karp and his meteorite theories .
his technique was worthless !
i still think we should contact him .
fair enough .
where is he ?
behind the iron curtain .
he couldn' t get a research grant here .
h. p. nutrient now available in the cafeteria ... for staff members from sectors 1 through 6 .
hemlock !
all for you , hippocrates .
not your own venom ?
tastes like orange juice .
nutrient 42 5 .
developed for the astronauts .
eight ounces satisfy all daily nutritional requirements .
except coffee .
and lipid soluble vitamins .
for that we have these .
help yourself .
so what' s the point of the cafeteria ?
wildfire isn' t always on crash status .
maybe there' s some sugar .
nope .
nothing that might provide a bacterial growth medium .
precisely .
no sugar in the gut .
i' d like a cigarette right now .
it' s after meals you miss ' em .
you should have no trouble on level 5 .
you won' t even get this close to a meal .
we' il be entirely on high protein nutrients .
i planned our work in three stages .
detection .
first step is to confirm that an organism is present .
characterization .
how' s it structured , how does it work ?
control .
how to contain and exterminate ?
jeremy , on this matter of extermination , we should go slowly .
without ever realizing it , we might destroy a highly intelligent form of life .
why don' t we get going ?
i' ve got two patients down there .
the team has two subjects .
they' re not guinea pigs , stone .
you may now proceed to level 5 , gentlemen .
um , stop by your rooms and insert these before taking the elevator .
i have risked drowning in that foul bath .
i have been parboiled , irradiated and xenon flashed .
and now you suggest i ...
i have to !
we haven' t done anything about the g. i. tract yet .
on level 5 we must be as nearly germ free as possible .
anyone care to join me for a smoke ?
watchdog to level 2 , sector d.
you are red kappa phoenix status .
off the main corridor on the outer rim ... are the living quarters , conference room , cafeteria , bio safety maintenance , etc .
inside are the labs .
where is the library ?
no need for books .
everything' s in the computer .
notice the capsule has already been delivered ... by the sterile conveyor system to the main control lab here .
your patients are here in the hot room of miscellaneous .
we can' t have any direct contact with them .
poor souls .
dr. dutton and dr. hall are wanted in main control immediately .
hey . !
if the patients are sealed off , how do i get to them ?
ever used a glove box ?
no .
wildfire' s gone a step further .
whole rooms that operate like glove boxes .
you' il be working in one shortly .
we have a magnetic " k" indices .
give us a code 3 when you get it .
i wanted you here while we find out ... if there' s anything still biologically active in the capsule .
suggestions ?
use a buffalo .
audio .
detectors " e" through " g " correction .
negative " n" scan .
negative " n" scope in l y 1 .
affirmative .
n" indicator in mp 4 .
i will repeat .
negative " n" scan .

whatever killed them at piedmont is still there and still as potent as ever .
if potent' s the word .
let' s try a rhesus .
yeah .
we' il want a postmortem on it anyway .
housekeeping to level 5 .
clean sweep schedule " b " now in effect .
germfree animal technicians , please consult schedule " a.
so , okay .
isolate and identify .
right .
you and i' il scan the capsule , ruth .
charlie , you work on these in autopsy .
open the s. l. , ruth .
adjust s. y. system for aseptricity as follows .
points 2 a at 5 .
points 9 through 12 at plus 1 .
plus 3 , plus 6 at minus .
run an initial vector study , charlie .
find out how the disease enters the body .
charlie ?
yes .
yes , the vector study first , then autopsy .
incredible .
dutton , be careful .
let our distinguished surgeon handle the knife .
fine , but not for a while .
first , i' m a pediatrician and a geriatrist .
take it easy .
charlie will have a technician .
what' s been done for them ?
just plasma for the old man , dextrose for the baby .
your therapy ?
no .
medcom' s .
do i call you miss medcom ?
if you like , dr. hall .
my name' s karen anson .
good .
i couldn' t cope with two machines .
how does this work ?
you' re lucky .
medcom' s got one of the best minds here .
it' s a medical data analyzer that can diagnose as well as prescribe .
it' s hooked up to the main computer on level 1 .
every console and instrument in wildfire ... is plugged into the main computer on a time sharing basis .
all our key lab studies are done on automated machines .
i prefer the personal touch .
it' s hard to come by in those suits .
have you worked in them ?
not for real .
but i' ve been drilling for three months .
thank god for an expert .
this sort of thing' s new to me .
it' s new to all of us .
until now , wildfire' s been like a game .
we' ve even had simulation biowar games here ... with live subjects ... volunteers .
i mean , i' m scared .
i never believed this could really happen .
well , it has happened .
i' il need some lab tests .
use this to check off what you want .
just touch the pen to the screen .
you draw the bloods , i' il do the physicals .
use the bar .
the tunnel seals off automatically behind you .
the only way you might possibly break your suit is with a scalpel , and a surgeon isn' t likely to do that .
bio safety to s. l. an animal in airlock 0 9 5 .
reconfirm red r. d. p. status before transfer .
second scan completed .
score , nothing to nothing .
go to 100 power .
no , ruth .
use only one microscanner .
you being paid by the hour ?
we could cover the capsule in one half the time .
there' s less chance of missing something when we both concentrate on one screen .
let' s go directly to the inside .
we can assume they put the scoop on the thing ... to scoop something into it .
they sure got what they were looking for .
we' re not here to make accusations .
we have a job to do ... purely as scientists .
maybe not so pure .
continue the scan , ruth , on the outside .
no , don' t do that .
we' il use the hands .
nothing can happen , sir .
i' m faster than the hands .
i want you out of the hot room .
b. z. doris to i. z. alice .
s. d. t. energy output is 1 . 8 to 3 . 0 joules ... with rate two to three milliradians .
and we still need those blankets .
no sweat , sir .
those cages are airtight .
i wish you would sweat a little more , toby .
sweat is a safeguard against some kinds of bacteria and carelessness .
use the hands .
wow !
transmitted by air , as we thought .
now we' ve got to determine its size .
could be a gas or some kind of a virus .
we' il use a hundred angstrom filter to begin .
about the size of a small virus .
all systems go , sir .
whatever it is , it' s larger than a virus .
we' il try a one micron filter .
hang in there , baby .
he must be pretty big .
i' m gonna get me a fly swatter .
do that .
here goes with two microns .
uh huh .
nasty .
at least we' il be able to get a good look at it .
dutton to stone .
about two microns in diameter .
big enough to be a complete cell .
interesting .
there' s a good chance it' s alive .
airborne transmission ?
yes .
what have you found ?
so far nothing .
our nobel laureate here ... won' t scan on the inside because he says ...
all right , ruth .
thanks , charlie .
keep at it .
it' s pointless to go on scanning outside .
if it' s two microns in diameter , it would' ve showed up at 440 .
true , but we didn' t know that before , did we ?
we' il start with five power on the inside .
stick to established procedure .
establishment gonna fall down and go boom .
switch to manual , ruth .
the interior' s too irregular ... to probe on automatic .
more light , huh ?
here' s his blood value now .
half normal .
severely anemic .
wake up , sir .
can you hear me ?
what' s your name ?
j jackson .
what ?
jackson .
stay awake , mr. jackson .
stay awake !
tongue blade .
sixty eight degrees on 1 4 0 7 .
sixty one on 1 2 0 3 .
loss rate is minus 0 0 12 .
please copy and confirm all receiving locks .
you can tell you' re a bachelor .
what was that ?
i didn' t say anything .
we' re doing an isotope scan .
how the bugs get into the body .
thought you should watch it .
i assume it was inhaled .
not likely it' s absorbed through the skin .
the mechanism of death .
we' il look at a replay of that at speed 6 .
that tells us what we want to know , hall .
the organism is inhaled .
the clotting begins in the lungs and spreads outward .
i didn' t think it possible .
i didn' t think the total volume of blood could solidify that fast .
i hoped maybe one crucial clot might form in the brain , which was what made them go insane , and then the rest of the blood clot more slowly .
we' d have a chance to cure that .
cure what ?
we don' t know what it is .
stone and leavitt haven' t been able to isolate the hellish thing .
of course they will in time .
of course .
hold it .
at the edge of that shadow , i think ...
me too .
it' s an indentation .
yes , about the size of a pencil point .
go to 40 .
go to 60 .
jeremy , do you think maybe ...
maybe it' s just a grain of sand .
go to 80 .
what about the bits of green ?
paint .
for god' s sake . !
pistachio ice cream . !
there' s no basis to assume it' s anything yet .
you' re too good a scientist not to be thinking the same thing i am .
if this is really something new , some brand new form oflife ...
the best hope of cracking it is to be grindingly thorough ... with the help of computer number one .
okay ?
now let' s get on with it .
hold it .
more pistachio ?
i count four patches .
keep going .
i' il computerize the coordinates .
let' s take a look at the rock at 100 .
i doubt that' s what knocked the capsule off trajectory .
unless the rock was going at tremendous speed , or unless it' s terribly heavy .
for pete' s sake , ruth , it can' t be that heavy .
hall and i could lift the capsule .
out there it might do anything .
maybe it has elastic properties we don' t even know yet .
let' s have a look at the green patches .
they must' ve come off the rock , if it is rock .
you know something ?
they do look like spatters of paint .
let' s go back to the rock and see it at 440 .
if that' s a meteor , it' s a damn peculiar one .
this left border over here , it' s smooth , almost like an artificial surface .
painted , maybe .
luminous paint .
if i keep watching it , i might think so .
wet paint sign and all .
jeremy ?
what ?
nothing .
you okay ?
it' s just my eyes are tired .
we' ve been at it five hours straight .
we' il take a caffeine break in a minute .
first i' d like to see one of the separate patches of green at 1, 000 .
did you see that ?
i saw it .
you didn' t change the lighting ?
i didn' t touch it .
looks alive .
yes .
it' s bigger than two microns .
which means the infection is spread by a mere fraction of the green .
i' m bringing down cameras .
let' s have the other microscanner .
stone to level control .
i need a mic t. roger .
will send .
jump it up to 1500 .
microscan doesn' t go any higher .
we can get 1500 light magnification in microchemistry .
i' il send the rock through .
attention c. l. t. s on levels 4 and 5 .
main computer shows capacity versus access time ... at ten to the twelfth bits .
for any change in memory configuration ,
c. l. t. s must check their unicom op .
beautiful , sir .
i' m the mic t.
you' re real sharp on the hands .
thanks .
nice to know one hasn' t lost one' s touch .
the next step is to find out what makes it grow .
we' il need samples from the scoop to send through maxcult for culture and isolation .
roger , sir .
in work .
good god . !
it' s growing .
not so good .
naturally he has acidosis .
his blood ph was nine points off normal .
but why ?
stupid machine !
what makes his blood too acid ?
ask the patient .
bio safety to s. l. , sectors 3 and 6 .
give us a code 3 when you get it .
mr. jackson ?
now , don' t be scared .
i' m a doctor .
bull .
where am i ?
a special laboratory in nevada .
we brought you here from piedmont .
you' re sick .
it' s this damn stomach of mine .
bleeding ?
hell , yes , bleeding !
bleeding in your stomach ?
you have an ulcer ?
damn tootin ' .
two years .
but you must have pain .
what do you do for it ?
aspirin ... and squeeze .
squeeze ?
what' s that ?
ain' t gonna tell ya .
so you' re a sterno drinker , huh ?
works good .
give him squeeze .
what' s the baby' s name , mr. jackson ?
you the nurse ?
uh huh .
shoot !
can' t see your legs .
do you know the baby' s name ?
give us a butt first .
smoking isn' t allowed here .
then go fish .
yeah .
when you' re finished , we' il transfusejackson and start ice water lavage .
he has a two year history of bleeding ulcers .
you seem delighted .
it may be the reason he survived .
if only our young gourmet weren' t so normal .
well , let' s hope nothing changes that .
we might have to before this is over .
they should' ve dropped the bomb .
they should' ve dropped it two days ago , general .
this phantom crashed a good 60 miles beyond the cordoned area .
men on the ground can' t cordon off airspace , sir .
i just don' t understand why the wildfire team ... hasn' t beefed about the delay in 7 12 .
it' s been almost 24 hours , and not a word from them .
i don' t think piedmont had anything to do with this crash , manchek .
it was a fluke .
that plane was only over the w. f. area for two minutes at 23, 000 feet .
it' s a routine training mission accident , i bet you .
pilot error .
let' s go .
check with wildfire message center , delta five .
make sure everything there is nominal .
send me word on scrambler at big head crash base .
okay .
checklim program completed .
all circuit banks nominal .
same thing on the m. c. n. console , captain .
just a minute , dr. robertson .
you' re saying stone' s $90 million facility , which you recommended , was knocked out by a sliver of paper ?
you tell that to the taxpayers . !
these were highly trained electronics men , senator ,
looking for an electronic fault .
the trouble was purely mechanical of the simplest kind .
but for them , it was like trying to see an elephant through a microscope .
the sliver had peeled from the roll ... and wedged between the bell and striker , preventing the bell from ringing .
i' m convinced we' re being held incommunicado .
very flattering .
we don' t know much more than when we got here .
we know about scoop now .
it' s possible what scoop found was no accident .
i suspect they were looking for the ultimate biological weapon .
sounds like you' re getting a little paranoid in this fun house .
what does stone think ... about the ultimate weapon , i mean ?
we' ve isolated the organism .
it' s in microchemistry .
we' il show you .
watchdog to electrical support ...
all right , lieutenant .
albuquerque center , this is air force 561 .
go ahead 561 .
my air hose is coming apart ...
like it' s dissolving !
everything made of rubber is coming apart !
i feel funny .
it' s a fluke , a vibration effect maybe .
let' s get up there .
has wildfire been informed ?
you mean the germ people ?
it went out to them on the scrambler an hour ago .
this they can' t ignore .
i. b. control to cafeteria level 3 .
number 4 charlie hatch shows condition blue .
alter responsivity characteristics until you get condition green .
ready .
nothing so unusual about our rock after all .
hydrogen , carbon , oxygen , sulfur , silicon , et cetera .
except the black rock isn' t rock at all .
it' s some kind of material similar to plastic .
how about that ?
the green is even simpler .
hydrogen , carbon , nitrogen and oxygen .
the four basic elements of life on earth , nothing else .
that' s a relief .
i' d have been happier if it' d turned out not to be alive .
green stuff , you really had us going for a while .
a. a. analysis results are ready , dr. dutton .
something' s wrong .
it' s not registering .
yes it is , sir .
it' s just registering double zero , double zero .
we' il switch to computerized analysis .
no amino acids . !
no proteins , no enzymes , no nucleic acid .
impossible !
no organism can maintain life without them !
you mean , no earth organism .
it must have evolved in a totally different way .
you got it .
it doesn' t come from here .
without chemical reactions there can' t be life , yet it grows , reproduces ...
wait . !
the infection at piedmont has been stopped by the bomb .
we' re secure at wildfire .
we have everything we need to achieve a breakthrough .
all we have to do is attack this problem like any other in science .
you could spend years working on a thing like that without solving its structure .
but when you do , there' il be some red faces around .
it could change everything .
great .
ruth , since kirke isn' t here , you take over the growth program in microbiology .
we' re halfway home if we find out what will keep that from growing .
charlie , you work with me on the e. m. hall ...
all right .
let me get back to my patients .
some simple mechanism i just don' t recognize yet .
there' s got to be something that the old man and baby have in common .
oh , hall ?
five minutes .
you told me before .
yes , we wouldn' t want you to get too far from the substation now .
men , keep a sharp eye open for pieces of rubber .
i' il repeat that for you .
keep a sharp eye open for pieces of rubber .
major !
major manchek !
take a look at that , sir .
we just found this , general .
it' s a human bone .
arm , i think .
it looks picked clean , almost like it was polished .
that' s right .
well , i don' t get it .
there is no actual rubber on the phantom f 4 , general .
it' s all a synthetic plastic compound called polycron .
it has some of the characteristics of human skin .
what the hell is that ?
what' s left of his oxygen mask .
it' s made of polycron .
i' d say it was done by a chemical reaction of some sort .
or maybe a microorganism .
meaning ?
meaning there was something in that plane that consumes plastic .
how' s maxcult coming , ruth ?
will you be finished by the midnight conference ?
easy .
good .
you can give us the results then .
feeling better , aren' t you , mr. jackson ?
yep !
do you always have to wear that iron suit ?
yep !
maybe you' il tell us the baby' s name now , mr. jackson .
manuel rios .
mex .
real little heller .
squalls mornin ' , noon and night .
neighbors wouldn' t let ' em keep their windows open .
do you sleep with your window closed ?
no sirree , bob .
fresh air fiend .
tell us what happened , mr. jackson .
i don' t want to think about it .
you know what people will say ?
piedmont was bad .
that' s why it was punished .
first the town went crazy and then was destroyed .
you' re crazy !
folks at piedmont was good , decent , normal folks .
the man we found dressed up in his doughboy' s uniform , call that normal ?
pete arnold , who worked at the store .
it was the disease .
how do you know ?
' cause the only thing wrong with him before that night was sugar .
diabetes ?
did he take insulin ?
a couple of times a day .
hated the needle .
i tried to talk him into usin ' squeeze .
insulin .
if he missed his treatment , he' d go ...
thanks , mr. jackson .
oh , my god !
central c. c. to big p. c. control , all levels .
testing laser system .
please maintain random fringe drift ... within ten percent of initial value .
dr. leavitt , you have a midnight conference .
the signal has struck twice .
i heard !
i heard !
l i' ve been busy .
the important thing is something can slow it down .
i think it' s some kind of blood disorder .
if the old soldier missed his insulin treatment , he' d go into acidosis .
the same as jackson on sterno .
i' il bet leavitt finds the organism shows no growth on some of the blood cultures .
what' s wrong with the baby' s blood ?
nothing ... so far .
then you' re back where you started .
no .
somehow they' re all interrelated .
i' il have the answer when i know why a 69 year old sterno drinker with an ulcer ... is like a normal six month old baby .
did you get any no growth readouts ...
no , but i' m not finished yet .
you told me you' d be finished .
i decided to play part of it back .
what for ?
the first time around should be ...
knock it off , hall !
wait .
wait .
we' re all tired .
tired people make mistakes .
they draw wrong conclusions , they drop things .
that mustn' t happen .
starting now , i want the team to get six hours sleep out of every 24 .
suits me .
before turning in , shouldn' t we file for a code name ?
yeah , good idea .
nine over 4 over 8 ... under 167 . 29 .
auto check in grade .
why andromeda ?
andromeda' s our ...
stone !
directive 7 12 has not been acted upon .
alternative directive 7 11 now in effect .
they didn' t drop the bomb !
it' s an m. c. n. transmission sent yesterday .
idiots !
put me through to dr. robertson .
in work , sir .
burke , you didn' t special alert an m. c. n. message to us .
there haven' t been any , sir .
the bell didn' t ring ...
don' t argue , damn it !
i' ve got one in my hand .
well , well .
about time we heard from you .
there has been a communications foul up .
never mind that now .
why hasn' t that bomb been dropped on piedmont ?
the decision on 7 12 isn' t final .
it was just postponed 48 hours .
by then the disease could spread into a worldwide epidemic .
it' s because of rash statements like that the president doesn' t trust scientists .
warn the president it may already be too late .
stay on his back , robbie .
you' ve got to make him call a 7 12 .
can you get me another appointment tonight , grimes ?
now let' s all just keep our heads screwed on .
any thoughts about the phantom crash ?
we sent you a couple messages on it .
a phantom jet strayed over the cordoned area around piedmont .
any other information ?
well , the pilot said ... that all the rubber on the plane was dissolving .
his last communication was pretty weird .
like he was crazy ?
he was mighty confused , that' s for sure .
robbie , it' s your job to get the president to activate a 7 12 immediately .
if he doesn' t , there' s no guarantee anyone west of piedmont will be alive in the morning .
simmer down , professor .
i' il wake the boss .
but general sparks says the crash was just a fluke .
forget the crash , robbie .
stay on that 7 12 and get back to me .
we' il be working around the clock .
that' s a good slice .
it' s too thick .
i' m setting it at 800 angstroms , and i' m going to a higher magnification .
now we' re getting somewhere . !
yeah .
but these can' t be more than a few molecules in depth .
that' s the one , that silver one .
this is a villabach alert , all levels .
this is a villabach alert .
electromagnetic waves are not registering on the d. i. r.
sample in the button and sealed , charlie .
start the vacuum pump .
stone , can i see you ?
i have the results of the growth cultures .
no , we can' t leave now .
we have an andromeda cell in the e. m.
okay , charlie , let' s put it on the screen .
let' s run it through the computer for contrast expansion .
stone ?
what do you think ?
it looks like a crystal .
well , gentlemen , there' s our answer .
to what ?
how andromeda functions without amino acids .
crystalline structure .
yes .
i' ve often thought that living matter ... might be based on crystals of some kind .
all these wedge shaped compartments , they' d serve to separate biochemical functions very well .
it' s dividing .
in a vacuum , bombarded by electrons ?
it shouldn' t even be alive !
that' s what i wanted to tell you .
the growth program ... shows andromeda can live on anything .
only gas and light affect it .
you didn' t get any no growth results on the cultures ?
none .
look .
the poorest growth occurs in pure oxygen ... incubated under infrared light .
andromeda grows best in carbon dioxide and hydrogen ... incubated under x rays .
no excretions .
no waste of any kind .
you' d expect that .
andromeda' s perfect for existence in outer space .
consumes everything , wastes nothing .
good lord .
stone to delta five .
put me through to robertson immediately .
what ?
god , i hope we' re not too late .
tell me .
it functions like an atomic reactor .
an atomic blast could provide it with enough energy ... to grow into a gigantic supercolony .
in one day .
you can relax now .
we' ve just left the president .
he agreed to drop the bomb .
no , you' ve got to stop 7 12 from being carried out .
now , wait a minute !
we' re not playing ping pong .
we just got through telling the president ...
for god' s sake , go back . !
it grows when exposed to x rays or any source of energy .
tell him no nuclear device must be detonated anywhere near it .
converts matter to energy , energy to matter directly .
then the bomb would only provide a fantastically rich growth medium .
understand ?
no , but i' il pass along the recommendation .
the boss will be pleased to know ... that he made the right decision on 7 12 in the first place .
congratulate him on his scientific insight .
and , robbie ?
you' d better get the atomic self destruct in here disarmed as soon as possible .
right .
i' il start on the clearances now .
it' il be done by morning .
no , no , no .
that won' t work until the damn thing' s going .
all the molecules appear to be the same .
yes .
andromeda isn' t composed of different substances ...
like a normal cell .
all the subunits are the same .
damndest thing i' ve ever s ...
boy , a single substance .
then how the hell does it operate ?
how does anything so simple utilize energy for growth ?
no way of telling from that structure .
yes , there is .
with this new data , we can get a computerized version of how andromeda functions .
they' re not uniform .
could be mutations .
what the devil ?
601 ?
the computer' s overloaded !
too much data coming in too fast .
dividing and mutating at the same time ?
and nothing to stop it .
normal earth checks and balances don' t exist for it .
we' d better get a biomath mapping of its new growth potential and spread .
according to this , there' il be a supercolony ... of andromeda over the entire southwest ...
jeremy , these are biological warfare maps .
why , yes , so they are .
oh , but simulations , charlie .
defensive .
it' s just a scenario .
that' s not the point , for god' s sake !
wildfire was built for germ warfare !
wildfire and scoop .
and you knew , stone .
you knew it !
that' s not true , ruth .
i learned about scoop the same time you did .
they already have andromeda programmed .
the purpose of scoop was to find new biological weapons in outer space , and then use wildfire to develop them .
it stinks !
you' re blowing your tops .
we have no proof .
the map !
don' t be an ass . !
that map only shows what andromeda could do in the hands of an enemy .
enemy ?
we did it to ourselves .
perhaps , but this is hardly the time to organize a protest .
another giant leap for mankind !
i wish i could believe you .
whether you do or not , the only important thing now is to find the antidote .
let' s get on with it , charlie .
test the cultured organisms for biologic potency .
all right , i' il run them against a rat in autopsy .
i want to seal up the capsule .
watch it .
andromeda' s altered .
its effect might be radically different .
i' il try to get us a photo of the mutated form .
photo lab to red map .
the offbeat access reference reads at 649 f , 1, 500 ...
please copy .
this may be the key to beating andromeda .
how , by starving him to death ?
no , but don' t feed him until i tell you .
contamination !
a seal has broken in autopsy .
a seal has broken in autopsy .
emergency procedures are in effect .
what' s the matter ?
infection spread .
autopsy .
is he alive ?
i should' ve been with him !
dr. dutton !
it' s no use .
it' s sealed off .
dr. hall !
she' s in trouble .
ruth , are you ...
she' s got the germ !
someone bring 100 milligrams of phenobarb in a syringe fast !
there' s no danger .
she isn' t contagious .
there' s no danger . ! ... to l 5 , p. i. e. and e. t. e.
your second quarter rest period has been canceled .
time r. a. has been reassigned ... according to crash program " e.
come on !
come on .
she can' t hurt you .
wasn' t she with dr. dutton ?
no , it' s epilepsy .
give her the injection .
she' il be all right .
good girl .
thanks .
i' m scared .
oh , lord , i' m scared .
you' il be okay , charlie .
we' re pumping pure oxygen through your lab now .
we know andromeda doesn' t do well in oxygen .
he' s alive !
where have you been ?
leavitt had a seizure .
what ?
epilepsy .
the red light flashing at 3 per second brought on a fit .
why in the hell didn' t she tell us about it ?
no top lab would have her if they knew .
insurance , prejudice , all that crap .
from the middle ages .
amazing he' s still alive .
well , it' s been three minutes .
he' s on pure oxygen .
i don' t know how long that can hold him .
we' re , uh , working on some ideas , charlie .
ask your germ warfare friends .
they have lots .
try to stay calm .
what happened ?
seal must' ve broken in there .
they had the same thing at the lunar lab .
that' s why we use polycron gaskets here .
at least the rest of wildfire is secure .
poor devil .
look at the way he' s breathing .
he' s scared to death .
that oxygen should relax him , slow down his breathing .
no , we want him to breathe fast !
in piedmont , jackson was crocked on sterno .
sterno acidosis .
rapid breathing .
what the hell you doing ?
turn off the oxygen .
put him on room air .
the baby , he' s normal .
cries all the time .
can' t catch his breath .
rapid breathing ?
it just can' t be that simple .
it isn' t .
dutton , i think rapid breathing helps .
don' t let the bug in your lungs long enough to penetrate blood vessels .
i want to turn off the pure oxygen , then you start breathing room air as fast as you can .
no !
no .
i was running a test in here .
the air is thick with andromeda .
experiment with your own life , damn it . !
we won' t do it , charlie .
take it easy .
i know i' m close .
i' m sure it has something to do with blood chemistry and breathing .
dr. hall .
may i please feed the baby now ?
he' s been crying steadily ...
that' s what i want .
keep him crying .
run another blood value on him .
get his ph measurements .
yes , doctor !
with all the yelling , blowing off carbon dioxide , the kid should have too little acid .
a blood condition just the opposite from the old man .
too much alkali .
well , what good does that do dutton ?
karen , where' s the blood test ?
it' s coming through now on your console .
hell of a way to run a hospital .
just what you expected .
opposite blood chemistries , the baby and the old man .
one of them should be a dead opposite but he' s not .
there must be a connection !
they both stayed alive at piedmont breathing the same air .
one' s blood too alkaline , the other too ... acid .
yes .
yes !
dutton , i' m turning off the oxygen .
breathe fast and hard .
no , jeremy !
don' t let him cut off my oxygen .
no !
the air in that room is loaded ...
air doesn' t matter .
blood does .
that' s the answer .
i need 30 seconds to run a growth program .
he could die in 30 seconds .
besides , leavitt checked all the growth programs .
she might have missed something .
epileptics blank out .
i want to see how the growth of andromeda is affected by blood chemistry .
the ph ...
oh , damn !
you do it .
excellent .
the graph' s practically straight up and down .
that means andromeda can only exist within a narrow range of ph .
a very narrow range .
on either side of the tolerance range , no growth .
nothing , right ?
it' s exterminated .
dutton , our troubles are over .
look at your console .
it grows within a narrow range of ph .
a very narrow range .
if your blood' s abnormal , if it' s too acid or alkaline ,
andromeda can' t survive in the body .
so breathe as fast as you can .
go into respiratory alkalosis .
yes , fine .
that' il shoot your blood chemistry to hell .
it' s what happens to the baby when he cries too much , or the old man on sterno .
how do you feel ?
okay .
a little dizzy , but okay .
he can' t keep breathing like that forever .
he' il hyperventilate , pass out .
we' ve got to get him something to alkalize his blood .
we can' t in there .
charlie !
that cage ... in the hot room .
right in front of you .
it' s alive . !
the rat' s been exposed as long as i have .
longer .
i exposed it to the cultures before the seal broke .
precisely .
andromeda' s mutated to a noninfectious form .
holy !
where does that gasket lead ?
central core .
it connects all the labs .
the gaskets are decomposing .
it' s andromeda .
next sector .
there' s no substation in this sector .
level 5 is sealed .
level 5 is sealed .
emergency procedures are in effect .
when the bomb goes off , there' il be a thousand mutations .
andromeda will spread everywhere .
they' il never be rid of it .
there are now five minutes to self destruct .
what about the other levels ?
can' t tell .
each sector seals off when it' s contaminated , even the elevator .
the defense system is perfect .
it' il even bury our mistakes .
what about the central core ?
the core' s equipped with safeguards .
like what ?
gas , lasers , to prevent escape oflab animals .
what would my chances be ?
they don' t exist for anyone anywhere if you stay here .
how do i get into the core ?
through that service port .
go ahead .
i' il ride shotgun for you in main control .
i can' t monitor the lasers here .
karen , get me a scalpel .
there are now four minutes and 30 seconds to self destruct .
cut it off !
cut the panel off .
karen , cut it !
come on .
hurry up .
hey , doc , you ain' t leavin ' us here , are ya ?
the lasers are tuned low for small animals , mark .
you can make it if you' re not hit along the spinal cord .
there are now four minutes to self destruct .
that' s the ladder across from you .
go before the gas starts .
there are now three minutes and 30 seconds ... to self destruct .
that' s the gas .
keep going .
the sensors have picked you up .
get moving .
duck . !
keep going .
duck . !
keep going .
duck . !
there are now three minutes to self destruct .
no , it' s no good .
the level' s contaminated .
you' il have to go to 3 .
go to 3 . !
there are now two minutes and 45 seconds to self destruct .
sway . !
weave . !
you' re zeroed in .
duck . !
there are now two minutes and 30 seconds ... to self destruct .
keep going . !
you' il make it .
there are now two minutes and 15 seconds to self destruct .
fight the effect .
it' s mostly shock .
you' ve lost some time , but you can still do it .
see the door ?
there are now two minutes to self destruct .
there is now one minute and 45 seconds ... to self destruct .
there is now one minute and 30 seconds ... to self destruct .
there is now ...
you' re in an airlock .
turn the wheel .
one minute and 15 seconds to self destruct .
no , not that one .
the one near the door .
there are now 60 seconds to self destruct .
there are now 55 seconds to self destruct .
there are now 50 seconds to self destruct .
where is it ?
there are now ... 45 seconds to self destruct .
come on .
where is it ?
help me !
there are now 40 seconds to self destruct .
there are now 35 seconds to self destruct .
there are now 30 seconds to self destruct .
there are now 25 seconds to self destruct .
twenty seconds , 19 , 18 , 17 , 16 , 15 , 14 , 13 , 12 , 11 , 10 , 9 ...
self destruct has been canceled .
congratulations .
i take it the bomb didn' t ...
no , it didn' t .
eight seconds to spare .
hardly even exciting .
what' s happening ?
the supercolony' s now off the coast ... and moving southwest across the pacific .
apparently andromeda hasn' t turned lethal again .
at least there haven' t been any reports of bizarre deaths .
we' re applying an adaptation of your antidote to it .
cloud seeding .
we' re seeding the clouds above andromeda ... with silver iodide .
the raindrops will carry the organism into the ocean , and the alkaline reaction from seawater should kill it .
just as acids or alkali in the blood stopped it .
this cloud seeding business , you absolutely sure it worked ?
you better be .
all reports indicate the experiment was successful .
then we can feel confident your so called biological crisis is over ?
as far as andromeda' s concerned , yes .
we have the organism at wildfire and we continue to study it .
we now know beyond a doubt that other forms oflife exist in the universe .
thanks to scoop .
yes .
however , with this new knowledge , there' s no guarantee ... that another so called biological crisis won' t occur again .
hmm .
what do we do about that ?
precisely , senator .
what do we do ?
