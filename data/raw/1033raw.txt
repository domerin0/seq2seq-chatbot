# one evening as the sun went down
# and the jungle fire was burning
# down the track came a hobo hikin '
# and he said , boys , i' m not turning
# i' m headed for a land that' s far away
# beside the crystal fountains
# so come with me , we' il go and see the big rock candy mountains
# in the big rock candy mountains
# there' s a land that' s fair and bright
# where the handouts grow on bushes
# and you sleep out every night
# where the boxcars all are empty
# and the sun shines every day
# on the birds and the bees and the cigarette trees
# the lemonade springs where the bluebird sings
# in the big rock candy mountains
# in the big rock candy mountains
# all the cops have wooden legs
# and the bulldogs all have rubber teeth
# and the hens lay soft boiled eggs
# the farmers ' trees are full of fruit
# and the barns are full of hay
# oh , i' m bound to go where there ain' t no snow
# where the rain don' t fall , the wind don' t blow
# in the big rock candy mountains
# in the big rock candy mountains
# you never change your socks
# and the little streams of alcohol
# come a trickling down the rocks
# the brakemen have to tip their hats
# and the railroad bulls are blind
# there' s a lake of stew and of whiskey , too
# you can paddle all around ' em in a big canoe
# in the big rock candy mountains ... #
# the jails are made of tin
# and you can walk right out again
# as soon as you are in
# there ain' t no short handle shovels
# no axes , saws or picks
# i' m a goin ' to stay where you sleep all day
# where they hung the jerk that invented work
# in the big rock candy mountains
# i' il see you all this comin ' fall

say , any of you boys smithies ?
or if not smithies , trained in the metallurgic arts , before circumstances forced you into a life of wanderin ' ?
jesus !
can' t i count on you people ?
sorry , everett .
well , all right .
if we take off through that bayou ... wait a minute !
who elected you leader of this outfit ?
i figured it should be the one with the capacity for abstract thought , but if that ain' t the consensus , then hell , let' s vote .
suits me !
i' m votin ' for yours truly .
well , i' m votin ' for yours truly , too .
ok .
i' m with you fellas .
mind if we join you , old timer ?
join me , m' son .
join me .
you work for the railroad , grandpa ?
i work for no man .
got a name , do you ?
i have no name .
that may be why you had difficulty finding gainful employment .
y' see , in the mart of competitive commerce ...
you seek a great fortune , you three who are now in chains .
you will find a fortune , though it will not be the fortune you seek .
but first ... first you must travel a long and difficult road , a road fraught with peril , mm hmm .
you shall see things ... wonderful to tell .
you shall see a ... a cow ... on the roof of a cotton house , ha .
and , oh , so many startlements .
i cannot tell you how long this road shall be , but fear not the obstacles in your path , for fate has ... vouchsafed your reward .
though the road may wind , yea , your hearts grow weary , still shall ye follow them , even unto your salvation .
no , the treasure' s still there , believe me .
but how' d he know about it ?
i don' t know , delmar .
the blind reputedly possess sensitivities compensating for lack of sight , to the point of developing psychic powers .
clearly , seeing the future falls into that category .
it' s not so surprising , then , that one lacking earthly vision ...
he said we wouldn' t get the treasure we seek , on account of our obstacles .
what the hell does an ignorant old man know ?
jesus , pete .
i told you i buried it myself .
if your cousin still has this farm and shoein ' impedimenta to restore liberty of movement ...
hold it right there !
you men from the bank ?
you wash' s boy ?
yes , sir .
daddy told me to shoot who' s ever from the bank .
we ain' t from the bank , young fella .
yes , sir .
i' m supposed to shoot folks servin ' papers .
we ain' t got no papers , neither .
i nicked the census man .
now , there' s a good boy .
is ... is your daddy about ?
hello , pete .
who are your friends ?
pleased to make your acquaintance , mr hogwallop .
my name' s ulysses everett mcgill ...
i' m delmar o' donnel .

yeah ...
i expect you want them chains knocked off .
they foreclosed on cousin bishop .
he hanged hisself a year come may .
and uncle radcliffe ?
the anthrax took most of his cows .
the rest don' t milk .
he lost a boy to mumps .
where' s cora , cousin wash ?
couldn' t say .
mrs hogwallop up and r u n n o f t.
she must have been lookin ' for answers .
possibly .
good riddance , as far as i' m concerned .
i do miss her cooking , though .
this stew' s awful good .
think so ?
i slaughtered this horse last tuesday .
i' m afraid she' s startin ' to turn .
# you are my sunshine

we got a bunch in yon bureau .
mrs hogwallop' s , matter of fact .
help yourself .
i won' t be needing ' em .
# you are my sunshine
# my only sunshine
# you make me happy

pa always said , " never trust a hogwallop .
come and get us , coppers !
you leave us no choice but to smoke you out .
we' re in a tight spot .
light her up !

gapped toothed , carpetbaggin ' , motherless spawn of hell !

what' s the damn problem ?
i can get the part from bristol in two weeks .
your pomade .
two weeks ?
that don' t do me no good .
nearest ford auto man' s bristol .
hold on .
i don' t want this pomade , i want dapper dan .
i don' t carry dapper dan .
i carry fop .
i don' t want fop , god damn it !
i' m a dapper dan man !
watch your language , this is a public market .
now , if you want dapper dan , i can have it in a coupla weeks .
ain' t this a geographical oddity !
two weeks from everywhere .
forget it .
just a dozen hair nets .
well , didn' t look like a one horse town , but try finding a decent hair jelly .
gopher , everett ?
no transmission belt for two weeks .
huh ?
they dam that river on the 21st .
today is the 17th .
don' t i know it .
we got but four days to get to that treasure .
after that , it' il be at the bottom of a lake .
we won' t make it walkin ' .
right ...
gopher ?
but the old tactician' s got a plan .
for the transportation , not keeping my coiffure in order .
how' s this a plan ?
how we gonna get a car ?
sell that .
i figure you can only have painful association for wash .
to washington bartholomew hogwallop ,
from his lovin ' cora .
" amor fidel ... is .
it was in his bureau ,
i reckon it' il fetch us enough for a good auto voiture and a little leftover besides .
whoo !
you got light fingers , everett .
gopher ?
you miserable little snake .
you stole from my kin !
who was fixin ' to betray us .
you didn' t know that at the time .
so i borrowed it till i did know .
that don' t make no sense !
a fool seeks logic in the chambers of the heart .
what the hell is that singing ?
appears to be some kind of a ... congregation .
care for some gopher ?
no , thank you , delmar .
a third of a gopher' d only arouse my appetite without beddin ' her back down .
oh , you can have the whole thing .
me and pete already had one .
we ran across a whole ... gopher ... village .

i been redeemed .
the preacher done washed away all my sins and transgressions .
it' s the straight and narrow from here on out .
and heaven everlasting' s my reward .
delmar , what are you on about ?
we got bigger fish to fry .
the preacher said all my sins is washed away , including that piggly wiggly i knocked over in yazoo .
you said you was innocent of that .
well , i was lyin ' .
and the preacher said that that sin' s been washed away , too .
neither god nor man' s got nothin ' on me now .
come on in , boys .
the water is fine .
come on , boy .
there , boy .
good doggy .
all right , boys , we got the scent .
the preacher said it absolved us .
for him , not for the law .
i gave you credit for more brains than delmar .
but witnesses seen us redeemed .
that' s not the issue , delmar .
even square with the lord , mississippi' s hard nosed .
you shoulda joined us , everett .
it couldn' a hurt none .
hell , it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade .
joining you fools in superstition ?
thank you , anyway .
and i like the smell of my hair , the pleasin ' odour' s half the point .
baptism !
you two are dumber than a bag of hammers .
you' re my cross to bear .
pull over , everett .
let' s give that coloured boy a lift .
you folks going past tishomingo ?

how you doin ' , son ?
name' s everett .
these two soggy sons of bitches are pete and delmar .

' cept prison food and greasy horse .
thanks for the lift , sir .
my name' s tommy .
tommy johnson .
how you doin ' , tommy ?
say , i haven' t seen a house out here for miles .
why are you out in the middle of nowhere ?
i had to be at that crossroads last midnight .
sell my soul to the devil .
ain' t it a small world , spiritually speakin ' ?
pete and delmar just been saved .
i' m the only one still unaffiliated .
it' s no laughin ' matter .
what' d the devil give you for it ?
well , he taught me to play this here guitar real good .
oh , son , for that you traded your everlasting soul ?
well , i wasn' t usin ' it .
i' ve always wondered , what' s the devil look like ?
well , there are all manner of lesser imps and demons , but satan hisself is red and scaly with a bifurcated tail ,
and he carries a hayfork .
oh , no .
no , sir .
he' s white .
as white as you folks .
with empty eyes and a big , hollow voice .
he travelled around with a mean old hound , that' s right .
he told you to go to tishomingo ?
well , no , sir .
why , that was my idea .
i heard there' s a man there , pays folks money to sing into his can .
they say he pays extra if' n you play real good .
tishomingo , huh ?
how much he pay ?
all right , boys , follow my lead .
hello ?
who' s the honcho here ?
i am .
who are you ?
well , sir , i' m jordan rivers , and these are the soggy bottom boys , out of cottonillia , mississippi .
songs of salvation to salve the soul .
uh , we hear that you pay good money to sing into a can .
well , that all depends .
you boys do negro songs ?
um ...
well , uh , sir , we are negroes .
all except for our accomp ... accomp ... the fella that plays the guitar .
yeah , well , i don' t record negro songs .
no , i' m lookin ' for some old timey material .
people can' t seem to get enough since we started broadcasting it on the pappy o' daniel flour hour , so thank you for stopping by , but ...
sir , the soggy bottom boys have been steeped in old timey material .
heck , we' re silly with it .
that' s right .
right .
we ain' t really negroes .
all except for our accompanist .

ahem .
i ... didn' t have no plan .
well , that hardly sounds like you .
all right , boys !
it' s the authorities !
your situation is purty nigh hopeless !
damn , they found our car .
we ain' t got the time and nary the inclination to chat with you boys any further .
damn , we got to skedaddle .
i left my pomade in the car .
maybe i can creep up .
don' t be a fool , everett .
we got to r u n n o f t.

let' s go !
well , hell , it ain' t square one .
ain' t no one gonna pick up three filthy , unshaved hitchhikers .
and one of them a know it all who can' t keep his trap shut .
the rancour reflected in that remark i won' t dignify with comment .
but i' il address your general attitude of hopeless negativism .
consider the lilies of the goddam field .
or , hell , look at delmar as your paradigm of hope .
yeah .
look at me .
you may call it unreasoning optimism , you may call it obtuse , but the plain and simple fact is we got close to ... three days before they ...
.. dam that river .
is this the road to itta bena ?
uh ... itta bena ?
itta bena ?
stay on this here road .
that ain' t right , i was thinking of , uh ...
take this road .
nah , that ain' t right .
seems to me there' s a road ...
cow road that used to lead all the way ...
well , most of the way ...
er , that ain' t right , either .
hop in while you give it a think .
right .
delmar .

you boys might as well keep my ... share of the riches .
well , where are you going , george ?
i don' t know .

now , what do you suppose is eatin ' george ?
well , they say that with the thrill seeking personality , what goes up must come down .
top of the world one minute , sad the next .
yes , sir , it' s as if our old friend george is a alley cat and his own damn humours are swingin ' him by the tail .
i wouldn' t worry , delmar .

can' t you see it , everett ?
them sirens did this to pete .
they loved him up and turned him into a ... horny toad .
pete !
pete !
pete !
pete !
pete !
pete !
pete !
pete , it' s me ... delmar .
it' s me ... delmar .
everett .
delmar , what the ... ? !
what are we gonna do ? !
i' m not sure that' s pete .
of course it' s pete .
look at him .
we got to find some kind of ... wizard can change him back .
i' m just not sure that' s pete .
you can' t display a toad in a fine restaurant .
folks' d go off their feed .
hey .
i just don' t think it' s right keeping him under wraps
like we was ashamed of him .
if it is pete , i am ashamed of him .
he got what he deserved , fornicatin ' with some whore of babylon .
these things don' t happen for no reason .
it' s a judgment on pete' s character .
well , the two of us was fixin ' to fornicate .
you' il have to excuse my rusticated friend , unaccustomed as he is to city manners .
hmm ?
i guess we' il have a couple of steaks and some , uh , gratine potatoes , and wash it down with your finest bubbly wine .
oh , i don' t suppose you have any ...
maybe the chef could prepare ...
just bring us a couple of leaves of raw cabbage .
yes , sir .
thank you .
i don' t believe i' ve seen you boys .
allow me to introduce myself .
name of daniel teague , known around here as big dan teague ,
or , pressed for time , big dan !
tout court !
name' s ulysses everett mcgill .
my associate , delmar o' donnel .
i detect , like me , you' re endowed with the gift of gab .
i flatter myself such is the case .
in my line , it' s plum necessary .
the one thing you don' t want ... is air in the conversation .
again we agree .
what kind of work you do , big dan ?
sales , mr mcgill , sales !
what do i sell ?
the truth , every blessed word of it .
from genesis down to revelations .
yes , the word of god , which , let me say , there' s damn good money in during these times of woe and want .
people want answers , and big dan sells the only book that' s got ' em .
and what do you do , you and your , uh , tongue tied friend ?
we , uh ...
we' re adventurers , sir , pursuing an opportunity , but we' re open to others as well .
i like you .
i' m gonna propose you a proposition .
you cover my bill for now , get your dinner wrapped picnic style and we' il retire to more private environs , where i' il reveal how to make vast amounts of money in the service of god almighty .
well , why not ?
i can use some civilised conversation .
don' t forget your shoe box , friend .
damn shame !
goddam campaign is lagging !
we need a shot in the arm .
hear me , boys ?
in the goddam arm !
election held tomorrow , that sumbitch stokes would win in a walk !
he' s the reform candidate , daddy .
yeah ?
a lot of people like that reform .
maybe we should get us some .
i' il reform you , you soft headed son of a bitch .
how we gonna run reform ?
we' re the incumbent !
is that the best you can come up with ?
reform ? !
weepin ' jesus on the cross .
that' s it !
start drafting my concession speech right now .
ok , pappy .
i' m just making a point , you stupid son' bitch .
give me back that hat !
pappy' s just makin ' a point .
shut up !
thank you for that fricassee .
i' m a man of large appetites .
even with lunch under my belt , i was a mite peckish .
our pleasure .
thank you as well for the conversational hiatus .
i generally refrain from speech during gustation .
there are those who attempt both at the same time .
i find it coarse and vulgar .
where were we ?
making money in the lord' s service .
friend , when you do speak , it' s to the point and i salute you .
yes , bible sales .
the trade is not complicated .
there are two things to learn ...
one , find a wholesaler , the word of god in bulk , as it were .
two , recognise your customer .
who are you dealing with ?
it' s an exercise in psychology , so to speak .
and it is that which i propose to give you a lesson in right now .
i like to think i' m an astute observer of the human scene , too .
no doubt , brother .
i figured as much at the restaurant .
that' s why i invited you all out here for this advanced tutorial .
what' s going on , big dan ?
it' s all about the money , boys !
that' s it !
gol ... durned ... money !
i don' t get it .
raah !
i' il just take your show cards .
yaah !
and whatever you got in the hole .
what the ... there ain' t nothin ' but a damn toad .
no , you don' t understand .
that' s pete .
pete .
you know these give you warts ?
end of lesson .
so long , boys .
hee hee hee !
see you in the funny papers .
y' all seen the end of big dan teague .
where are they ?
talk , you unreconstructed whelp of a whore !
where they headed ?
aah !
your screams won' t save your flesh .
aah !
only your tongue is , boy .
where they headed ?
aah !
whoa , hound .
sweet summer rain .
like god' s own mercy .
your two friends have abandoned you , pete .
they don' t seem to care about your hide .
ok .
stairway to heaven , pete .
we shall all meet by and by .
god damn it !
god forgive me !
hold .
believe me , delmar , he would have wanted us to press on .
pete , rest his soul , was one sourass son of a bitch and not given to pointless sentimentality .
it don' t seem right getting the treasure without him .
maybe it' s for the best he was squished .
why , he ... was barely a sentient being and ... when we clean up and get a little smellum in our hair , we' re gonna feel 100 % better about ourselves and about ... life in general .
must be near parchment farm .
sorry sons of bitches .
seems like a year ago we busted off the farm .
pete got a brother ?
not that i' m aware .
heat must be getting to me .
# oh , the storm and its fury raged today
# crushing hope that we cherished so dear
# the cloud and storm will in time pass away
# and the sun again will shine bright and clear
# keep on the sunny side
# always on the sunny side
# keep on the sunny side of life
# it will help us every day
# it will brighten all the way
# if we' il keep on the sunny side of life
# if we' il keep on the sunny side of life #
that was wonderful .
that sure was .
yes .
now , i know the sunnysiders would agree with me when i say that the great state of mississippi cannot afford four more years of pappy o' daniel !
four more years of cronyism !
nepotism !
rascalism !
of service to the interests !
now , the choice , she' s a clear ' un .
pappy o' daniel , slave of the interests ...
homer stokes , servant of the little man .

deceitful , two faced she wolf .
never trust a female , delmar .
remember that precept and your time with me won' t have been ill spent .

" hit by a train .
truth means nothing to a woman , delmar .
triumph of the subjective .
you ever been with a woman ?
well , i' ve ...
i got to get the family farm back before i can start thinking about that .
that' s right .
if then .
believe me , a woman' s the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days of man .
everett , i never figured you for a pater familias .
ohh , yes .
i have spread my seed .
and look what it' s ...  god damn it .
what the hell ... ?

stokes got a constituency !
well , it' s a well run campaign .
midget and broom and whatnot .
devil his due .
hell of an organisation .

what' s that , junior ?
we can hire us a little fella even smaller than stokes' s .
you slump shouldered sack of nuts !
we' d look like a bunch of johnny come latelys bringin ' out our own midget .
don' t matter how stumpy !
that' s the goddam problem , people think stokes has got fresh ideas .
he' s au courant and we' re the past !
it' s a problem of ...
perception .
right .
he' s pulling our pants down .
gonna paddle some behind .
ain' t gonna paddle it .
gonna kick it .
no , he' s gonna paddle it .
that' s not a proper description .
that' s how i' d characterise it .
it' s more of a kickin ' situation .
god ...
god forgive me .
i could not gaze upon that fireshow .
pete .
hold still !
can' t ... stand much longer .
it was ... it was a mo moment of weakness .
quit babblin ' , we gotta skedaddle .
that' s all i got .
they lured me out for a bathe and then they dunked me , trussed me up like a hog , and turned me in for the bounty .
shoulda guessed it .
typical womanly behaviour .
we' re lucky we left before they came back .
we didn' t abandon you , pete .
we just thought you was a toad .
no , they never did turn me into a toad .
well , that was our mistake , then .
we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from woolworths .
everett , was it the one branch or all of them ?
well , i ain' t had it easy , either , boys .
frankly , uh , well , i ...
i spilt my guts about the treasure .
huh ?
i' m awful sorry i betrayed you , fellas .
must be my hogwallop blood .
that' s all right , pete .
awful white of you to take it like that , everett .
i feel wretched .
spoiling your play for a million dollar point two .
you should rip out my guts .
no , that' s all right .
you boys are true friends !
ohh !
you' re my beaucoup friends .
pete , i don' t want you to beat yourself up about this , eh ?
i can' t help it , but that' s a ... a wonderful thing to say .
yeah .
pete , uh ...
well , fact of the matter is ...
damn it ...
there ain' t no treasure .
fact of the matter is there never was .
but ...
so where' s all the money from the armoured car job ?
i never knocked over no armoured car .
i was sent up for practising law without a license .
but ...
i had to bust out .
my wife wrote me she was getting married , i gotta stop it .
i had two weeks left on my sentence .
i couldn' t wait , wedding' s tomorrow .
my added time for the escape , i don' t get out now till 19 ... 87 .
i am sorry about that .
i' il be ... 84 years old .
i guess they' il tack on 50 years for me , too .
boys , we was chained together .
i had to tell you something .
busting out alone was not an option .
i' m sorry .
84 years old .
well , i' il only be 82 .

we have all gathered here to preserve our hallowed culture and heritage from intrusion , inclusion and dilution of colour , of creed , and of our old time religion .
we aim to pull evil up by the root before it chokes out the flower of our culture and heritage .
and our women , let' s not forget those ladies , y' all ,
looking to us for protection from darkies , from jews , from papists , and from all those smart ass folks say we come descended from monkeys .
that' s not my culture and heritage .
yes !

and so ... we gonna hang us a negro .
hooray !
i ain' t never harmed you , neither of you gentlemen .
uh ...
mm hmm .

since we' ve been following your lead , we got nothing but trouble .
i' ve gotten this close to being strung up and consumed in a fire and whipped no end and sunstroked and soggied .
and turned into a frog .
he wasn' t turned into a frog .
almost loved up , though .
so , you' re against me now , too ?
is that how it is , boys ?
the whole world and god almighty ... now you ?
i guess i deserve it .

i' il get my wife back , we' il leave .
goddam disgrace !
made a travesty of the entire evening .
ohh !
what i wouldn' t give to get a hold of those agitators .
whoever heard of such behaviour , even amongst the coloured ?
mulattos , maybe .
i suspect some miscegenation in their heritage .

ladies and gentlemans , here and listening at home , the great state of mississippi ...
pappy o' daniel , governor ... wants to thank the soggy bottom boys for that wonderful performance .
and it looks like the only man in this great state who ain' t a music lover is my esteemed opponent in the upcoming , homer stokes .
there ain' t no accounting for taste .
sounded to me like he was harbouring a hateful grudge against the soggy bottom boys on account of their rough and rowdy past .
looks like homer stokes is the kind of fellow who wants to cast the first stone .
well , i' m with you , folks .
i' m a forgive and forget christian , and i say ... if their rambunctiousness and misdemeanoring is behind them ...
it is , ain' t it ?
yes , sir , it is .
well , then , i say , by the power vested in me , these boys is hereby pardoned !
and furthermore ... in the second pappy o' daniel administration , these boys is gonna be my brain trust !
what' s that mean , everett ?
well , it means you and me and pete and tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne , so to speak .
oh , ok .
so , without further ado , and by way of endorsing my candidacy , the soggy bottom boys is gonna lead us all in a chorus of " you are my sunshine " .
ain' t you , boys ?
one of our favourites .
son ... you' re gonna go far .
# you are my sunshine
# my only sunshine
# you make me happy
# when skies are grey
# you' il never know , dear
# how much i love you
# please don' t take

these little men finally caught the criminal of the century .

yup , gonna electrify me .
i' m gonna go off like a roman candle !
20, 000 volts chasing a rabbit through yours truly !
gonna suck all the power right out of the state !
gonna shoot sparks out of my head and lightning from my fingertips !
i' m george nelson , and i' m feeling ten feet tall !
looks like george is right back on top again .
cow killer !
well , at least you boys get to see the ancestral manse , the home where i spent so many a happy day in the bosom of my family refugin ' , if you will , with a mighty oak tree out front and a happy little tyre swing on it .
where' s the happy little tyre swing ?
end of the road , boys .
no .
wait a minute .
let' s go , boys .
it' s had its twists and turns , now it deposits you here .
wait a minute .
you have eluded fate and you have eluded me for the last time .
tie their hands , boys .
you can' t do this , now .
didn' t know you' d be bringing a friend .
he' il just have to wait his turn , share one of your graves .
you can' t do it , we just got pardoned by the governor .
it went out on the radio .

well , we ain' t got a radio .
god have mercy .

there' s a perfectly scientific explanation .
that ain' t the tune you was singin ' back at the gallows !
any human being' il cast about in a moment of stress .
no , they' re flooding this valley so they can hydroelectric up the whole darn state .
yes , sir , the south is gonna change .
everything' s gonna run on a paying basis .
out with the spiritual mumbo jumbo and the backward ways .
we' re gonna see a brave new world where they hook us all up to a grid .
yes , a veritable age of reason .
like the one they had in france .

# my latest sun is sinking fast
# my race is nearly run ... #
all' s well that ends well , " some poet said .
that' s right , honey .
don' t mind telling you i' m awful pleased my adventuring days have come to an end .
time for this old boy to enjoy some repose .
that' s good , honey .
you were right about that ring , too .
any other wedding band wouldn' t do .
this here was fore ordained .
fate was a smilin ' on me .
that' s not my ring .
what ?
not your ring ?
that' s one of aunt herlene' s .
you said it was in the roll top .
i said i thought it was .
no , you said ...
or under the mattress .
or maybe in my chifforobe .
well , i' m sorry , honey .
we need that ring .
it' s at the bottom of a durn big lake .
uh uh .
a 9, 000 hectare lake .
i don' t care if it' s 90, 000 .
that lake was not my doing .
i' ve counted to three .
no , wait , honey .
finding one ring in the middle of all that water
is one hell of a heroic task ! # .. and gives me victory
# o , come , angel band
# come and
# around me stand
# o , bear me away on your snow white wings
# to my immortal home
# o , bear me away on your snow white wings
# to my immortal home #
# my latest sun is sinking fast
# my race is nearly run
# my strongest trials now are past
# my triumph has begun
# o , come
# angel band
# come and around me stand
# o , bear me away on your snow white wings
# to my immortal home
# o , bear me away on your snow white wings
