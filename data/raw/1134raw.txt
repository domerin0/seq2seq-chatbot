coolidge college was established in 18
who knows this ?
it was in your freshman facts .
the first day of spring semester .
a time to say good bye to the parents once again ... and say hello to a few new student bodies .
as for me , well ...
i like to start off each semester with a certain time honored tradition .
a ritual , if you will , that allows me ... to get my head in the right place .
okay , so suk mee' s a little old ... but she is just so damn good .
she' s great with these quick jobs ... plus there is no substitute for decades of experience .

first year can be kind of scary , can' t it , timmy ?
my name' s not
but you know what i' ve learned in my seven years here at coolidge ...
timmy ?
i' ve learned that you can' t treat every situation as a life and death matter ... because you' il die a lot of times .
write that down .
i don' t have a pen .
well , remember that then .
and you know something , timmy ?
i think you' ve got the balls to make it here .
call me nuts ... but i believe in you .
you see , timmy , you can' t let this lead you all the time .
sometimes you' ve gotta heed this .
i think you' ve got a lot of heart in there , mister , don' t you ?
don' t you ?
i mean , look around you .
timmy ?
great work , van .

i' m staying here with my friends .

maybe your friends can pay your tuition .

write that down .
i need more time .
there' s got to be something that we can work out .
what is that intoxicating scent you' re wearing , doris ?
i have cats .

maybe you could put me on some sort of extension ... program ?
a little pay as you go ?
are you trying to seduce me ?

no !
you know , maybe this isn' t such a good idea .
being bad seldom is .
oh , yeah .
that' s the shit .

i' m feeling a little cold sore coming on .
maybe we shouldn' t do this for three to six weeks .
shut up , bitch , and give me some sugar .
fill this out .
it' s a standard payment plan extension form .

van , you must make four monthly payments of $5, 000 each .
i' m sorry , taj .
i' m gonna have to let you go .
i don' t have the resources to pay for your services anymore .
a good soldier does not leave his commander ... just because he lies wounded , arms torn off at the sockets ... intestines spilling out onto the mud , picked at by the birds .
i will stay on at no charge .
okay .
exactly how much money do you have ?
he has only $34 .
damn , van !
what the hell you gonna do with $34 , man ?
congratulations , taj !
your first blow job .
in my country , a woman' s mastery of her gastronomical releases ... is the ultimate aphrodisiac .
desiree is the foremost connoisseur of chili con carne ... and a ta at coolidge .
i wish i had teachers like that .
and just like that , topless tutors was born .
x ... equals ... six ?
yeah !
we knew you could do it .
desi told me how she and a few of her grad school pals ... could use some extra income .
taj proved to be an excellent company accountant ... as well as our most valued client .
excuse me .
i' m looking for information on a current student here , van wilder .
freshman year .
i' il get the others .

there are more of these ?
actually , there are many more .
it seems mr. wilder didn' t quite come out of his shell ... until mid sophomore year .
thanks .
it' s like this itchy , rashy burning sensation .
and it hurts when i

my editor did say this would be a challenge .
van , second date with emily .

i' m so sorry , baby .
i totally forgot .
i have an interview for the paper .
at 10 : 00 at night ?
can' t you postpone it ?
gwen , first exam most crucial .
it' s not like you' re on a deadline for the boston globe .
it' s the only time he had available .
i' il call you as soon as i get back .
bye .
he ?
all right .
gwen , all right !
you' re just in time .
take your clothes off .
i' m not taking off my clothes .
it is the naked mile run .
everybody else is in their birthday suit .
except that guy .
i have a few questions for you .
in time .
this is gonna be fun .
you know that three letter word that starts with f ?
so you' re quite the campus man , heading events like the jger olympics .
yes , well , you haven' t lived ... until you' ve shot putted blitzed on jger .
heinie ?
this was a really bad idea .
are we gonna reschedule or what ?
who' s a big boy ?
oh , god !
those things could raise the titanic .
you van wilder ?
the strip club owner got tired of using his b squad ... so he came back for the starting lineup .
topless tutors was dead .
we are truly up the ganges river without a bamboo oar .
we' re still $1, 200 short of your next tuition payment .
taj , i learned a long time ago that worrying is like a rocking chair .
it gives you something to do , but it doesn' t get you anywhere .
write that down .
don' t even sweat it , taj .
i' ve got a plan .
let' s go get fucked up .
sounds good .
is that all you think about ?
i admit i applied for this job ... because i wanted to cut loose and shake my rump ... but i do not believe that this dilemma will be solved by partying .
can i help you , son ?
i certainly hope so , mr. wilder .
i come to you in desperation .
i' m panos patakos , president of the lambda omega omega fraternity .
i' m sure you' re aware of our ... stigma .
yeah , you guys have had the best gpa the last 50 years .
indeed , but believe it or not ... the best gpa doesn' t get you laid .
damn well should .
amen .
this month marks our 75th anniversary .
i am here to ask you to aid us in throwing a party ... a party we can be proud of ... a party people will actually show up to .
gosh , i' d really love to help , but i have a bamboo oar stuck up my gangees .
it' s very scary stuff .
i just don' t have the time .
how much is your time worth ?
panos reminded me that i had one ... very valuable skill i' d yet to tap my undeniable ability to throw one hell of a party .
i was hanging on by a thread , but i was still making tuition .
the strawberry !
eat the strawberry !
it' s worth 250 !
don' t you think i know that ?
you treat me like a child .
i don' t like the way you condescend me .
don' t do that !
frankly , you' re juvenile .
guys .
i know ms. pac man' s special .

two girls utterly infatuated ... with men who have larger than normal ... medulla oblongatas .
pearson , i got a hot news tip for you .

i' m just doing some final revisions to this piece on euthanasia .
oh , i read that .
made me want to kill myself .
i' m kidding .
where' s my wilder story ?
there is no story , elliot .
the guy' s a joke .
he tries to turn every interview into a date .
a good writer gets her story no matter what .
please get me the wilder piece .
he' s throwing a big party tonight .
you should be there .
this is really a pimpin ' good time .
yes , it is .
look who' s checking out the badalandabad .
her name' s naomi .

i' m not here to skate .
for some reason , my editor thinks you' re a story .
what do you think ?
as a story , i think ... you' re a little soft .
wow , all this time i thought i was more to you than just some flaccid story .
a dilemma has arose up front .
don' t know if we got our point across .
crystal clear , guys .
this is incredible .
100 percent .
don' t go anywhere .
seriously .
van is a godsend .
i would have paid him way more than a grand for this party .
i would have cashed in my israel bonds .
how do you put a price on dignity ?
how do you put a price on poonani ?
yes !
oh , god !
oh , my god .
feel it !
whoa .
trick or treat .
what' s going on ?
this vaginal discharge won' t let us partake in the party .
graphic .
i' m sure we can accommodate a few more , yeah ?
no can do .
we' re at maximum capacity .

you two know each other ?
that' s my girlfriend , gluteous erecti .
you must be premed dick .
yeah , that' s right .
what' s it to you ?
thanks for the story .
what story ?
brilliant , pearson .
i have been inundated with people telling me ... how much they enjoy reading about this guy .
they want more , and so do i.
i want you to do a follow up .
i did your story , elliot .
i' m not doing another one .
even if i tell you it' s gonna be on the front page of the graduation issue ... in two months ?
and i quote , " van wilder is a party pimp .
sick boy .
can you believe she wrote that ?
van wilder' s phone .
i do not foresee that to be a problem .
and that guy she' s with all kinds of wrong for her .
sick boy , how are you doing ?
van , the shingles are all gone .
that ointment really worked .
thanks .
lookin ' good there , buddy .
he' il call you back .
unbelievable .
van wilder' s phone .
terrible .
i think so .
yeah .
hang on .
unbelievable .
van' s room .
saturday night , yeah .
that' s how did you from the paper ?
yeah , that' s fine !
okay , thanks .
no problem confirming .
bye .
this writing , it' s just
i was just wondering if you could ... slam the door in my face .
van , you must listen to me .
because of her article , everybody wants to have a party thrown by van wilder ... the party liaison .
your cash camel has arrived !
we need to talk .
this is why i don' t do interviews .
you totally slammed me .
you journalists and your irresponsible reporting .
i recorded quotes that you got money from the lambdas to throw them a party .
recorded ?
what are you , bugged ?
do i need to frisk you ?
why is my story such a big deal to you ?
because i didn' t want the students to know i threw the party .
they paid me , but that' s not the only reason i did it .
lambdas are cool in their own right .
people just needed to realize it .
i' m sorry .
i didn' t know you had a benevolent agenda .
there' s two sides to every story , gwen .
i have a chance to make front page of the graduation issue ... which is a huge deal to me .
let me get the other side .
there' s this function i' m hosting tomorrow night .
if you want ... you could tag along .
i' il be there .
it' s a date .
it' s an interview .
remember , today' s assignment is about shadow .
so don' t get too hung up on detail .
all right , everybody ?
oh , lord !
so much sinew , i need a bigger pencil .
8 : 30 p . m .
yeah , that' s fine .
word spread around campus .
my calendar was filled with parties to plan .
van wilder , party liaison , was born .
at the hillel house , i broke bread .
and then i broke the boredom .
they said i did them a mitzvah .
that' s yiddish for " good deed .
write that down .
oh , yeah , she came too .
this is the second party of his she' s gone to .
sounds serious .
threatened ?
threatened ?
please .
i' m president of both my fraternity and the student government .
he' s nothing more than a mild rectal itch .
you know what you do about a mild rectal itch , gordo ?
what' s that , richard ?
you scratch it .
then you scratch it some more .
the more you scratch at it , the worse it gets ... until finally you have nothing left but a raw , chafed ... possibly infected anal cavity .
then it' s won .
when all you had to do from the start was take a medicated pad ... and smother it .
all right , people , midterm is next week .
here you have your five categories commerce and trade , so forth and so on .
what you doing ?
i' m in the middle of class .
you know , that five letter word .
i thought we could spend some time together ... for the story .
i want you to have this .
yeah .
and thank you .
all right , things to remember commerce and trade
everybody just file out in an orderly fashion .
what ?
come on .
hop in .
i am not getting in that thing with you .
if you want the story , you' il get in this thing with me .
what happened ?
is everyone okay ?
wilder .
are we gonna get in trouble for being in here ?
it' s cool .
equipment manager owes me a favor .
i introduced him to his wife .
life is all about developing relationships , gwen .
i hope you can skate .
so the deal is , i score ... you cooperate and answer all my questions ?
i miss  dinner for two , me and you .
clothing optional .
come on !
holy crap .
my brothers play hockey ... for the rangers .
my dad just didn' t see me as a sound investment anymore .
but he gave up on me and my mom long before i ever came here .
maybe seven years of tuition ... is a good way to remind him that you' re still angry .
so how long have you and premed richard been together ?
since my freshman year .
i bet he' s a tighty whitey guy .
excuse me ?
white , elastic band , constrictive .
you can tell a lot about a person by the kind of drawers they wear .
like you .
granny panties , i bet .
does that allude to me being the plain , boring type ?
i just wanted a visual .
i think it takes a lot more than the kind of underwear one wears ... to define them as a person .
like what ?
like their actions .
for instance , most people ... want to get out of school so they can make money .
you' re trying to make money to stay in school .
why ?
i like it here .
what about your future ?
you take life way too seriously .
life is serious .
i used to party with this guy who once told me ...
don' t take life too seriously .
you' il never get out alive .
he used to write for the school paper .
he kept babbling about the differences between light and dark beer .
very strange , but good advice .
you think about the future too much , you kinda forget about the present ... obviously .
and i am really enjoying the present right now ... sharing a penalty box and a tri latte with gwen pearson ... who believes censorship reflects society' s lack of confidence in itself .
you actually read that article ?
okay , look , i read the damn article , but don' t tell anyone ... because if word gets out that i read , my reputation shot to hell .
she' s smart , she' s beautiful ... she can skate .
she' s not for you , dude .
she' s too high strung .
besides , babes that fine they' re way into themselves and shit .
after this weekend , we should have sufficient funds ... to cover your next two payments .
i mean , this girl is dynamite .
too bad she' s dating strapper john , md .
where did you find that ?
in your room a few days ago .
i' m trying to spark this bong , but this damn thing won' t light .
that' s no bong !
it' s for my schlong !
hold on .
you mean i put my mouth on your cock pump ?
oh , damn !
i have a date with naomi tomorrow night ... and i just wanted to bring my a game .
taj , come on !
that' s what i' m here for , right ?
now , follow my foolproof plan ... and i' m gonna help you put the bang in banglapur .
all you need are the three fundamentals scented candles ... massage oil ... and barry white .
write that down .
hey , no cock pump .
no cock pump .
barry white .
i' m gonna go wash my hands now .
oh , gwen !
your labia feels so good around my swollen phallus .
i' m fairly confident i' m going to ejaculate .
i' m releasing my seminal fluids inside of you now !
are you okay ?
yeah .
why ?
didn' t you
it' s kinda hard in 15 seconds .
damn it !
you know the kind of pressure i' m under with my exams .
i' m sorry .
look , i' m sorry .
this semester' s marks could determine the next ten years of our lives .
do you realize that ?
you know ... you shouldn' t take life too seriously .
you' il never get out alive .
what the hell is that supposed to mean ?
i' m late for my study group .
she was getting awfully chummy with the rectal itch .
son of a bitch .
disappear !
yes , superior leader , sir .
it' s time to excise that cancerous lump .
forget him .
let' s crap in the chapter room and make the pledges clean it up .
it' il be fun .
i wish i could , gordo .
i got dinner at gwen' s parents ' house .
sounds special .
is wilder gonna be there ?
hey , guys .
hey , richard .
is there anything i can do for you today ?
dear van
here you go , taj .
get your rave on , man .
thanks .
you got it .
see you tonight .
gwen .
the invite to the parents ' house .
this is big .
this is very , very big .
doesn' t she have a boyfriend ?
details .
i' m off .
taj , you' re in charge .

i' m still looking for that dare to be great situation .
maybe you should start looking for that dare to be employed situation .
the student body finds van so intriguing ... that my editor has asked me to do an expos on him ... for the school newspaper .
isn' t that wonderful ?
that will be quite the page turner .
it' il be a very well written article .
gwen is an extremely gifted journalist .
are you and richard in the same fraternity ?
oh , no .
van isn' t exactly delta iota kappa material .
richard , you rascal , you never told me that you were a dlk .

richard , will you help me open it ?

you got an a in my freshman economics class .
you remember one thing
apathy is the glove into which evil slips its hand .
i' il write that down .
you do that .
you' re not fooling anybody !
you' re only fooling yourself ! .
why don' t you walk ?
i think i' il walk from here .
are you stalking me ?
because that would be super .
my mom did want me to invite you to her tupperware party next week .
was that a
judges ' ruling .
uh huh .
yeah .
i do believe that was a joke .
i want to apologize for what richard did the other night .
it was a really immature stunt .

oh , yeah , baby , i' m burning up .
you are most amazing to make me feel so ... damn hot !
i wonder how t bad' s date' s going .
scented candles , massage oils , barry white .
yeah , we can' t be too far from climax , huh ?
why do i always fail ?
you put too much pressure on yourself .
don' t worry about the money .
i' il figure something out .
more importantly ... when the time is right ... it' il happen .
you' il find the one .
i need to see the grade transcripts for van wilder , please .
i don' t think so .
student transcripts are confidential .
sorry .
swim team really does need your love , folks .
and if milty mingleton can shove himself ... into that weenie bikini ...
then you don' t need to be shy about making your donations now !
thank you , milty !
after we put all the water back in the pool ... we' il be accepting donations in the form of ... cash , visa and full frontal nudity .
hutch , take over .
that' s right , folks .
save the swim team .
bikini clad judges for a fund raiser ?
that' s pretty ingenious .
sex sells , gwen .
sex sells .
it' s not too late for you to enter the doubles breaststroke if you like .
no , thanks .
i forgot my suit .
i just came across a bit of interesting information .
all right , look .
the vet assured me that canine semen is perfectly healthy .
in fact , surprisingly rich
you' ve been 18 units shy of graduating for the past 6 semesters .
whoa .
you went klepto on my transcripts .
what' s going on with you ?
you' re actively trying not to get out of here .
why are you doing this ?
do you ever stop playing the in depth reporter ?
i just want to know why you' re putting off your life .
not for the paper .
for me .
i have no comment ... for either of you .
external occipital protuberance .
posterior gluteal line .
dorsal appendage .
gwen .
was the last one right ?
yeah , that' s right .
wrong !
the dorsal appendage exists only in marine equipped mammalia .
i knew you weren' t listening .
what' s wrong with you ?
nothing .
i' m fine .
let' s get out of here , go grab a beer .
are you insane ?
you know my midterm and finals ritual .
i study till 11 : 00 .
nine solid hours of sleep .
protein shake in the morning .
okay , very cute .
and also correct .
which gives us 2 hours and 53 minutes of study time .
so , honey , please focus .
all righty ?
i have confirmations from the african american club ... the gay and lesbian caucus , mecca , hepa , peta .
this multi coalition party was a masterful plan .
it should triple our income .
i just hope it' s enough .
van , you must listen to me .
we are merely one party away from accomplishing our goal .
what if she' s right , huh ?
what if i' m avoiding graduation because i' m scared ?
listen to yourself , meathead .
you' ve never doubted yourself in your whole life .
this girl' s got you thinking , man .
it' s not good .
not good at all .
hey , you !
please move banner a skosh higher , huh ?
you got all this .
i' m gonna go
i' m gonna go make some calls for the party , okay ?
hi , van .
hi , donna .
hey , guys .
what are you doing in here ?
i had to talk to you .
i thought a lot about what you said , and
well , just just take a look at this .
yeah .
doodles .
i attended class today .
just about stayed the whole time too .
i' m glad you went to all your classes today .
and a few that weren' t mine .
stepped into the wrong one .
liked what i heard , stayed .
that' s great .
it really is .
it really is .
but don' t do it for me .
do it for you .
maybe i' m doing it for both of us .
i shouldn' t even be talking to you like this .
and i shouldn' t be in the women' s locker room !
but sometimes you gotta let your heart lead you ... even if you know it' s someplace you know you' re not supposed to be .
how often does your heart lead you into the women' s locker room ?
this would be a first .
why do i find that hard to believe ?
i' m not saying i' ve never been in here before .
i' m saying it' s usually a different part of my anatomy that does the leading .
oh , my god .
i just couldn' t believe it .
gwen and van in the women' s locker room .
i mean , i just couldn' t believe it .
so anyway , let me tell you something .
i' m sorry , fellas .
the bakery' s closed .
i' m here to enlist your services .
let me guess .
come as your favorite drunk on jis , come gargling frat boy party " ?
then your mom can come .
it' s gonna be a bachelor party .
one last night of debauchery with the fellas ... before settling down with my fiance , gwen .
oh , please , you didn' t think she' d be interested in a fuckup like you ?
that ought to be enough to get you started .
hello ?
casey .
i' m just using gwen' s computer .
is gwen there ?
i need to talk to her .
she' s at richard' s getting ready for the engagement dinner tonight .
message ?
nope .
that' s all right .
bye .
thanks for coming .
lindsey and rob make such a great couple , don' t you think ?
yeah , i' m happy for them .
they' re gonna make a great married couple too .
you know why ?
because they love each other ?
because they' re compatible .
like a heart transplant patient finding a donor with the same blood type ... and just the right chromosomal anomalies .
a perfect match , connected forever .
but that would mean one of them would have to be dead .
gwenny , i' m just saying that they' re a match .
just like you and me .
lucky girl .
gwendolyn elizabeth pearson ...
i' d be honored if you and i surgically and spiritually ... grafted our lives together .
richard , i don' t know what to say .
just say yes , because i' ve got even more amazing news .
northwestern called this morning .
they wanna interview me .
they' re gonna send some recruit alums to campus for written and oral exams .
and then i am in !
oh , man , northwestern .
that' s great .
i' m so happy for you , richard .
be happy for both of us .
the richard and gwen life plan is kicking in .
northwestern .
i am the shit .
your father wants to get us a place in forest grove as an engagement present .
my parents know about this ?
yeah , i told everyone .
where are you going ?
i' m not sure , and for some reason ...
i feel really good about that .
i can' t hold on
there' s no easy way
hey , van , can i borrow
my god , what happened to you ?
i got hit by a big truck .
are you okay ?
i' m all out of love
i' m so lost without you
i know you were right
believing for so long
dope song .
what' s it called ?
gwen used me for her story , then married an ass wipe ... and ran over my heart with a big metaphorical truck .
originally performed by air supply .
who' s air supply ?
how old are you , sally ?
i' m old enough to be jealous of that gwen girl .
okay , you can do this .
i' m all out of love
i' m so lost without you
i know you were right believing for so long
you must be gwen the truck driver .
hey .
excuse me .
gwen !
hey , hold up a second .
what are you doing here ?
what am i doing here ?
what were you doing in there ?
as smashed as i am , i' m pretty sure that' s my room , wasn' t it ?
what was that girl , a freshman ?
she reads at a sophomore level .
this was a big mistake , van .
i' m leaving .
why are you here ?
did you come to hire me to do your bachelorette party ?
' cause your party pimp has already been booked by your fianc .
my fianc ?
what are you talking about ?
when are you two tying the knot ?
seriously , i' d really like to hold that date open .
that is none of your business .
and you know what ?
you' re none of mine .
sounds to me like your rectal itch was getting a late night booty scratch .
first , my bitch turns down my proposal .
then she runs into that loser' s arms .
now i don' t even know where my bitch is .
wilder' s got some big blowout tonight .
maybe your bitch is gonna be there .
you do not call her that , gonad !
hey , guys .
just giving you all the 411 .
i' m a counselor for the further leaders of america' s overnighter .
the bus doesn' t leave for a few hours .
is there anything i can do before i go ?
anything at all ?
okay , listen up .
we' ve got one quick stop off before we go .
tit wad !
all right , thank you , man .
enjoy yourself .
all right , sister .
enjoy yourself .
power to the people .
how you doing , my man ?
what' s up ?
i hate to break this to you , ming , but you ain' t asian .
man , you ever heard of tiger woods , bitch ?
you better get out of here before i hit you upside the head with a three iron .
what' s wrong with you ?
enjoy yourself .
what' s wrong , dog ?
nothing .
i don' t feel like partying .
that' s a first .
hey , van .
i just wanted to come by and extend an olive branch .
id , please .
it' s a terrible picture of me , but
well , i' il be the judge of
there' s nothing fake about this id .
did you sit behind me two semesters ago ?
i think i remember this behind .
i mean , you sitting behind me .
this whole rivalry thing has become a tad childish .
well , i hope we can put it all behind us and be friends .
that' s what gwen wants .
you have absolutely no idea what gwen wants .
say hi to your gerbil for me .
okay , kids .
this is our uncle jger .
that' s right .
drink up .
this tastes like shit .
do you have any scotch ?
gotta go .
sorry .
bye .
bye bye .
call me .
gentlemen .
trooper .
we got an anonymous tip that there' s some underage drinking going on here .
hutch ?
hell no , man .
i' ve been at the door all night .
good enough for me .
have fun , guys .
all right , trapper .
stay cool .
i love you , man .
no , man .
i love you .
those circus midgets cannot hold their booze !
don' t worry , van .
we' il get you out , man .
delta iota kappa rules !
damn it , gwen , pick it up .
i know you' re there .
you know i have my northwestern interview next week .
look , i need you to help me " release " ... some pressure .
you know , help me " relax .
just so we' re clear , i' m talking about intercourse .
i know you had a fling with wilder .
and it' s okay .
you just had to get it out of your system .
i just hope you used some protection .
and i wouldn' t want our future children to be tainted ... because mommy went slumming one night back in college .
why don' t you go " release " your own pressure ?
and just so we' re clear , i' m telling you to go fuck yourself ! .
hi , partner in crime .
is there anything i can do for you today ?
oh , my god !
we make such the fab team !
last night , i was so like bonnie and you were so like clyde .
and now this .
would you shut up ?
i' m trying to pleasure you .
sorry , richard .
pleasure away .
ps , this is an awesome room .
ps , shut the fuck up !
here , i' m done with all of this .
the wilder story' s not done .
read it before you criticize .
he got expelled today .
is that in your story ?
' cause it should be .
is van here ?
he don' t wanna see you .
excuse me ?
look .
why don' t you just leave him alone ?
home wrecker .
oh , thank you !
thank you !
out of my way !
stop packing !
you can appeal the expulsion .
it' s in the school charter .
any student may appeal an expulsion before the university judicial board ... and state his or her case within 48 hours of being discharged .
do you want my hot tub , or should i just give it to milty ?
we can get the law club to help .
they owe you after the " sue me , screw me " soiree you threw .
thank you .
i appreciate it .
i' m really not interested .
you' re not hearing me  it' s over , taj !
fuck you , van wilder !
you heard me .
i say i say ... fuck you , you you you you you you pussy ass motherfucker !
you you dicksucker !
don' t sugar coat it , taj .
tell me how you really feel .
seven years .
seven years !
i' ve accomplished nothing !
there' s no reason to stay here anymore !
sure , sure .
you' ve made tons of friends ... who in the drop of a rupee do anything for you , and that doesn' t mean much ?
who cares about sick boy and the charities you' ve helped ... and all of our athletics those are all so minuscule ?
and i guess so is a promise ... made to a wet behind the ears kid from india whose only dream ... was to bury his face in a beautiful woman' s lotus patch .
you have shown me a life i could only dream about ... back home while masturbating in my father' s woodshed .
most importantly , you saw potential ... in me .
if you do not see potential in yourself , then you are a blind man .
i' m leaving .
then leave .
but leave the honorable way .
you' ve been looking for that dare to be great situation .
it is at your doorstep .
we need to talk .
get me the law club .
it' s ridiculous !
it' s preposterous !
it' s ludicrous !
by god , it' s impetuous !
so does that mean you gonna help us ?
oh , it' s on .
let van stay !
let van stay !
let van stay !
let van stay !
we are now in session .
mr. wilder .
you were found in violation of article 2 , section b of coolidge' s bylaws soliciting of alcohol to extreme minors ... which is grounds for immediate expulsion .
you have opted to appeal .
the floor is yours .
ladies and gentlemen ...
as you know ...
i' ve been a student here for seven years , and i' ve
let van stay !
let van stay !
order !
order !
settle down , everyone .
continue , mr. wilder .
i' m okay .
i' ve learned a lot here at coolidge .
let the record show that ... when i attended class ...
i did receive exemplary marks .
however , it was only when i met a special someone ... that i realized what i was doing hiding .
see , after this is real life , and i wasn' t ready for that .
i don' t know why exactly .
i do know that i don' t wanna end up like my father ... whose whole life revolves around work .
but i see that now .
and i' m ready to move on .
well , that' s that .
good luck , loser .
who' s ready for lunch ?
mr. bagg , you will be quiet .
what' s any of this got to do with ... that he' s guilty of an infraction that deserves expulsion ?
mr. wilder .
i can' t argue against the infraction .
i was responsible for that party , so what happened was my fault .
i' m here to lay myself at the mercy of this court ... and suggest an alternative punishment .
make me graduate .
if you' il kindly take a look at my transcripts ... you' il see i' m 18 units from graduating with a leisure studies degree .
i am pleading to this committee , reinstate me .
let me audit my last six classes , take the finals ... and leave coolidge with a degree .
god , i' ve bled ... crimson and blue for nearly a decade .
this school has given me so much .
let me repay coolidge ... by parting ways as a graduate .
what are the courses mr. wilder needs in order to graduate ?
biology , english lit , calculus , economics ...
sociology and political science .
wow .
that' s quite a load .
well , van can handle quite a load .
if we expel him , there could be some sort of a coup d' tat .
he broke a rule .
he should pay the consequences .
well , let' s take a vote .
there' s five of us here .
majority rules .
i vote reinstatement .
mr. bagg ?
expulsion .
miss haver ?
reinstatement ... over and over .
okay .
mrs. seay ?
expulsion .
professor mcdoogle ?
you know , i' ve waited a long , long time for this day to come .
either way ...
van wilder' s tenure here at coolidge is over .
let' s see what the kid' s made of .
he' s in !
he' s in !
hey , jeannie .
look .
i just wanted to explain about the whole , you know , richard thing .
me and richard' s unspoken bond blossomed the other night in one beautiful ... symbiotic act .
what sort of act ?
messing up that van wilder party .
and then we bumped uglies .
it was the best ten seconds ever .
ever .
yes , these interviews are somewhat of a formality ... but i think it' s crucial we like minded people get to know one another .
i knew you' d come to your senses .
hello , richard .
look .
i know we have a lot of surgery to perform on our relationship .
but right now i am prepping for the biggest moment of our lives .
i have a written exam first , and then an interview with five northwestern alums .
all doctors .
that' s why i came to help make you your shake .
that' d be terrific , gwenny .
i' il see you downstairs .
but hurry .
interview' s in a half hour , other side of campus .
sorry about that .
northwestern .
i am the shit .
you certainly will be .
gwenny , thank you .
good luck , honey .
you deserve it .
i certainly do .
cytosine .
nothin ' but net , my man .
now remember , before any final , take a pregame dump .
thanks for coming in .
you did a great job , really .
richard !
i was just talking about you .
hey , surprise .
i' m on your oral exam board .
look , come in here .
i want you to meet your future alumni .
i gotta go  no , come on .
it' s a great time .
look , it' s richard .
finished his written exam in only 20 minutes .
this kid is a dynamo .
richard , i want you to meet dr. stern .
dr. fine .
it' s a pleasure to meet you , mr. bagg .
i' ve heard a lot about you .
dr. brown .
this is something of a formality .
we just want to get to know you better .
and dr. smelnick .
richard , is there something you want to say ?
you look like you want to get something out , son .
oh , my god !
vile .
oh , it burns !
i' m bleeding !
dear god , that' s wretched .
oh , i kept the first for another day .
yet knowing how way leads on to way ...
i doubted if i should ever come back .
i want you to tell me what robert frost was trying to express here .
i' m gonna need at least one more booklet .
what ?
in other school news ... we have an update on the " wilder watch .
the rigorous day has been a success for van the man .
five finals in the can with professor mcdoogle' s advanced econ final to go .
van !
van , wake up , wake up , wake up .
your final' s in exactly seven minutes !
all right .
it' s the moment of truth , people .
i' m so glad you could fit us into your schedule this morning .
wouldn' t miss it for the world , sir .
all right .
pass these out .
thank you .
it' s getting to be that time of the hour .
and your time is up , mr. wilder .
pencils down .
thank you .
for four years ...
i have been grooming myself for the real world .
i , like many , define the real world as stuff that happens after graduation .
but i was wrong .
it took a man by the name of van wilder to teach me that .
you' ve all undoubtedly been to one of van' s parties .
he' s probably touched your life in some way , whether you know it or not .
watch van do belly flops into a pool ... but make sure you see he' s raised $5, 000 to give the swim team a next season .
as you' re all aware , van was almost expelled .
what you probably don' t know is that he was set up ... by a pathetic , egomaniacal frat boy ... one who this reporter knows firsthand to have a serious problem ... with premature ejaculation .
and in reaction to this lynching ...
van put in more effort in six days than most have all semester .
win or lose , we should thank him for reminding us what we' re all capable of .
that' s simply what he does he inspires the uninspired .
van .
hurry .
the night of fun and fornication' s upon us .
hey , have you heard from gwen ?
no , she she hasn' t yet called back .
right .
i' il be down in a minute , okay ?
okay .
see ya , v.
jesus .
this is some pad you got here .
decorated in early fuck .
well , i made it a point to personally come down here , wilder .
i wanted to give you the results of your test firsthand .
and just as i expected ... you succeeded .
ninety one percent .
what ?
i' m proud of you , wilder .
i' ve been waiting all these years for you to realize your potential .
that' s why you and i had friction ?
i thought it was ' cause i fooled around with your daughter freshman year .
why ?
what you fooled around with my daughter ?
what ?
hey , i know you .
thank you very much .
you' re the best , van .
hey , i couldn' t have did it without you .
appreciate it .
i need you to fill this up with ice .
pack as much as you can inside .
okay ?
excuse me .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
my name is orissa punjab nizamabad .
i' ve just transferred here from banglapur .
excuse me .
can you tell me ... where i might find the raddest fucking dude alive ?
yeah , by the pool , gramps .
hey , i know you , man !
oh , fuck .
congratulations , van .
i knew you had it in you .
dad !
i can' t believe you' re here .
i can' t believe you graduated .
a friend of yours ... sent me this .
i' m proud of you , van , graduation or no graduation .
thank you .
and i' m sorry that i spent ... such a buttload of your money for so long .
it' s by far the best investment i ever made .
you did good .
let' s get this man " leid .

wow .
wow .
i was hoping you' d say that .
may i ?
as long as we cuddle afterwards .
there' s so much that i need to say the article
i was scared that you wouldn' t come .

which ones did you choose ?

it' s gonna be a bachelor party .
one last night of debauchery with the fellas .
you can' t even

i was wondering  i' il do it .
