coconut milk' s a natural laxative .
things that gilligan never told us .
oh .
pretty well made fire , huh , wilson ?
so ...
wilson .
we were en route ... from memphis for 1 1 and a half hours .
about 475 miles an hour .
so they think that we are right here .
but ... we went out of radio contact ... and flew around that storm for about an hour .
so that' s a distance ofwhat , 400 miles ?
four hundred miles squared .
that' s 1 60, 000 ... times pi 3 . 1 4 .
five hundred and two thousand , four
that' s a search area of 500, 000 square miles .
that' s twice the size oftexas .
they may never find us .
this tooth isjustkillingme .
itstartedoutjusthurting when lbit down , butnowitjusthurts all the time .
all the time .
it' s it' s agoodthing there ' s notmuch to eataroundhere , because i don' t think i could chewit .
justkeepsucking on all that coconutandall that crab .
andjust think ,
i usedto avoid going to the dentist ...
iike theplague .
iputit offevery single chance lgot .
butnow , oh , what i wouldn' tgive ... to have a a dentist righthere in this cave .
i n fact , i wish you were a dentist .
yeah .
dr. wilson .
you wanna hear something funny ?
back home in memphis , my dentist' s name is dr. james spaulding .
she' s much prettier in real life .
shut up !
bakersfield " ?
bakersfield !
this could work .
this could work .
twenty two forty four lashings .
forty four lashings .
so
we have to make rope again .
wilson , we' re gonna have to make a hell ofa lot of rope .
eight lashings ofthese structurals .
that' s 24 apiece .
that' il be 1 00 1 60 .
here we are today .
that gives us another month and a half until we' re into march and april , which is our best chances for the high tides and the offshore breezes .
we need we need 424 feet ... ofgood rope , plus another 50 feet , say , for miscellaneous .
round that offto 475 feet ofgood rope .
now , ifwe average 1 5 feet a day
plus , we have to build it , we have to stock it , we have to launch it .
that' s gonna be tight .
that is not much time .
but we
we live and we die by time , don' t we ?
now , let' s not commit the sin ofturning our back on time .
i know .
i know .
this is it .
that' s all that' s left .
i checked over the whole island , and that is all that' s left .
so we' re gonna be short .
short .
we' il just have to make some more out ofthe videotape .
yes .
no , we have time .
we do .
we have time .
look !
the wind' s still blowing in from the west .
i know !
yeah , i know i know where there' s 30 feet ofextra rope !
but but i' m not going back up there .
there , there .
there , you see ?
huh ?
there .
are you happy ?
do you have to keep bringing that up ?
can' t you just forget it ?
huh ?
you were right .
you were right .
it was a good thing that we did a test ,
' cause it wasn' t gonna be just a quick little snap .
i would have landed on the rocks .
broken my leg or my back or my neck .
bled to death .
but it was the only option i had at the time though , okay ?
it was what , a year ago ?
so let' s just forget it .
and what is your point ?
well ... we mightjust make it .
did that thought ever cross your brain ?
well , regardless , i would rather take my chance out there on the ocean ... than to stay here and die on this shithole island , spending the rest of my life talking to a goddamn volleyball !
shut you up .

tomorrow we' re gonna bring you back to life .
how long are you gonna be , man ?
well ...
how long will that buy me ?
about ten minutes .
i' m awake .
i saw your taxi drive up .
get in here out ofthe rain .
i saw you down at the hub today , so i know you were down there .
let me get you a towel .
they' re sleeping .
ifyou come in , i' il make you some coffee .
it' s a nice house .
yeah , we got a nice mortgage too .
what' s your daughter' s name ?
katie .
katie .
she' s a beautiful little girl .
she' s a handful .
j ust let me get one thing straight here .
we have a pro football team now , but they' re in nashville ?
um , yeah .
oh , my god .
okay .
they used to be in houston .
first they were the oilers , andnow they' re the titans .
the houston oilers are the tennessee titans ?
yeah .
but that' s not all .
they went to the super bowl last year .
and i missed that .
you would' ve died .
it was so exciting .
they almost won by one yard .
one lousyyard right at the end .
i got whole milk , 2 % and nonfat .
i don' thave anyhalf and half , andthat' s whatyoulike .
that' il do fine .
what happened to you becoming a professor ?
you' re not dr. kelly frears lovett ?
when you , um
when your plane went down , everything just sort of got put on hold .
i think about taking it up again , though .
i came out here to give you this .
oh , my god .
i' m sorry it doesn' t work .
and i , uh , i kept the picture .
it was all faded anyway .
i want you to have it .
i gave it to you .
that' s a family heirloom , and it should stay in your family .
that' s everything lhave from whenyou went down to now .
they said they never figured out what caused the crash .
probably some mislabeled hazardous material caught fire .
so here' s where that ship found you .
you drifted about 500 miles .
this is where your island was , about 600 miles south ofthe cook lslands .
and these are the search grids .
ships went back and forth for weeks looking foryou .
i never should' ve gotten on that plane .
i never should' ve gotten out ofthe car .
i wanna show you something .
come here .
this is this is our car .
you kept our car .
all right , now , this is weird .
it' s a good car .
had a lot of memories in this car .
two very nice memories .
oh , that trip down to the gulf , yeah .
so , can i drive it ?
it' s your car .
that' s good , ' cause my my taxi' s gone .
um
let me get some stuff out ofthe back .
you thinkyou' re gonna have more kids ?
i don' t know .
it' s kind ofconfusing right now .
well , you should .
i mean , really , you should .
i would .
so , what now ?
i don' t know .
i really don' t know .
you said you' d be right back .
i' m so sorry .
me too .
chuck !
chuck !
chuck !
i always knew you were alive .
i knew it .
but everybody said i had to stop saying that that i had to let you go .
i love you .
you' re the love of my life .
i love you too , kelly .
more than you' il ever know .
chuck ?
you have to go home .
we both had done the math , and
kelly added it all up .
she knew she had to let me go .
i added it up , knew that i' d
i' d lost her .
' cause i was never gonna get offthat island .
i was gonna die there , totally alone .
i mean , i was gonna get sick or i was gonna get injured or something .
the only choice i had , the only thing i could control ... was when and how ... and where that was gonna happen .
so ...
i made a rope .
and i went up to the summit to hang myself .
but i had to test it , you know ?
ofcourse .
you know me .
and the weight ofthe log ... snapped the limb ofthe tree .
so l l
i couldn' t even kill myself the way i wanted to .
i had power over nothing .
and that' s when this feeling came over me like a warm blanket .
i knew ... somehow ... that i had to stay alive .
somehow .
i had to keep breathing , even though there was no reason to hope .
and all my logic said that i would never see this place again .
so that' s what i did .
i stayed alive .
i kept breathing .
and then one day that logic was proven all wrong , because the tide ... came in , gave me a sail .
and now , here i am .
i' m back ... in memphis , talking to you .
i have ice in my glass .
and i' ve lost her all over again .
i' m so sad that i don' t have kelly .
but i' m so grateful that she was with me on that island .
and i know what i have to do now .
i gotta keep breathing .
because tomorrow , the sun will rise .
who knows what the tide could bring ?
