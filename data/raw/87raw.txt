hold up .
hold on !
excuse me , excuse me .
spoon , where you been at ?

i' m a police officer .
you ... ... are an asshole .
ma' am , is that your purse ?
of course it' s my purse .
i left my inhaler at home .
he was running it out to me .
i saw a robot running with the purse and assumed
what ?
are you crazy ?
i' m sorry for this misunderstanding .
don' t apologize .
you' re doing what you' re supposed to do .
but what are you doing ?
have a lovely day , ma' am .
you' re lucky i can' t breathe , or i' d walk all up and down your ass .
lead by example .
it says that right on your badge .
we gonna talk about this ?
about what ?
help !
police !
that robot stole my dry cleaning !
oh , you wanna talk about that .
detective ...
... how many robots snatch purses ?
john , the thing is running
how many robots in the world ...
... have ever committed a crime ?
define crime .
answer my question , damn it .
none , john .
now tell me what happened today .
nothing .
better be the last nothing .
spoon , are you sure you are ready to be back ?
because you can take your time .
i' m fine , john .
thank you .
better here than sitting around at home .
homicide .
spooner .
please take the next exit to your right .
welcome , detective spooner .
welcome to u. s. robotics .
you have entered the garage level lobby .
please use the elevators for direct access to the main level concourse .
thank you .
good to see you again , son .
hello , doctor .
everything that follows is a result of what you see here .
ls there something you want to tell me ?
i' m sorry .
my responses are limited .
you must ask the right questions .
why did you call me ?
i trust your judgment .
normally , this wouldn' t require a homicide detective .
but then , our interactions have never been entirely normal , agreed ?
you got that right .
is there something you want to say to me ?
i' m sorry .
my responses are limited .
you must ask the right questions .
why would you kill yourself ?
that , detective , is the right question .
program terminated .
goodbye , old man .
afternoon , boys .
hey , detective .
enlighten me .
massive impact trauma .
u. s. robotics .
i gotta get my kid something .
anything upstairs ?
nada .
door was security locked from the inside .
wham , splat .
the guy' s a jumper for sure .
we gotta be smart about this .
let' s deal with it later .
detective .
lawrence robertson .
richest man in the world .
i' ve seen you on television .
can i offer you coffee ?
sure , why not .
it' s free , right ?
i don' t think anyone saw this coming .
you know , i should have , i suppose .
i knew him 20 years .
alfred practically invented robotics .
he wrote the three laws .
but i guess brilliant people often have the most persuasive demons .
so whatever i can do to help  sugar .
i' m sorry ?
for the coffee .
sugar ?
you thought i was calling you " sugar .
you' re not that rich .
it' s on the table .
thank you .
when lanning fell , he was holding the little green ... ?
the holographic projector .
right .
why do you think lanning' s hologram would' ve called me ?
i assumed you knew him .
yeah .
i knew him .
holograms are just prerecorded responses ... ... designed to give the impression of intelligence .
this one was programmed to call you upon his suicide .
death .
i' m sorry ?
it was programmed to call me in the event of lanning' s death .
suicide is a type of death , detective .
don' t misunderstand my impatience .
oh , no .
go .
go .
a really big week for you folks around here .
you gotta put a robot in every home .
look , this is not what i do , but i got an idea for one of your commercials .
you could see a carpenter making a beautiful chair .
then one of your robots comes in and makes a better chair twice as fast .
shitting on the little guy .
that would be the fade out .
yeah , i see .
i suppose your father lost his job to a robot .
maybe you' d have banned the lnternet to keep the libraries open .
prejudice never shows much reason .
no , you know , i suspect you simply don' t like their kind .
well , you got a business to run around here .
the last thing you need , especially this week , is a dead guy in your lobby .
but , hell , seeing as how you got one , maybe i' il look around .
ask a few questions .
do the whole " cop " thing .
i' il send someone to escort you .
thank you very much .
lawrence told me to accommodate you in any way possible .
really ?
okay .
i reviewed dr. lanning' s psych profile .
alfred had become a recluse .
he rejected human contact for machines .
so you' re a shrink , huh ?
my ex wife would sure be glad i' m talking to you .
you don' t know her , do you ?
i' m sorry .
are you being funny ?
i guess not .
level 10 .
so would you say that dr. lanning was suicidal ?
it would seem the answer to that is apparent .
that' s not what i asked you .
no .
i wouldn' t have thought so .
but obviously i was wrong .
that' s a long way down .
you people sure do clean up quickly around here .
i can' t blame you .
who wants some old guy going bad in the lobby ?
he was not " some old guy .
alfred lanning was everything here .
we are on the eve of the largest robotic distribution in history .
by saturday , it' il be one robot to every five humans .
these robots are the realization of a dream .
dr. lanning' s dream .
you know what , in that dream of his ... ... i bet you he wasn' t dead .
you keep 24 hour surveillance ?
obviously .
company policy .
where are the feeds ?
sensor strips .
everywhere but the service areas .
they link to our positronic operating core .
thermostat wasn' t good enough .
you gave the building a brain .
she was actually lanning' s first creation .
she ?
that' s a she ?
i definitely need to get out more .
virtual lnteractive kinetic lntelligence .
v. i. k. i.
good day .
v. i. k. i. designed chicago' s protective systems .
i have decreased traffic fatalities by 9 percent this year .
thanks .
show me inside the lab from one minute prior to the window break .
apologies .
there appears to be data corruption .
show me outside the lab from the window break until now .
look , you have great posture .
you stand really straight .
i' m slouching .
would you like to go inside now ?
oh , sure .
right after you .
authorized entry .
so , dr. calvin , what exactly do you do around here ?
my general fields are advanced robotics and psychiatry .
i specialize in hardware to wetware interfaces ... ... to advance usr' s robotic anthropomorphization program .
so , what exactly do you do around here ?
i make the robots seem more human .
now , wasn' t that easier to say ?
not really .
no .
hansel and gretel .
ls that on the usr reading list ?
not precisely .
what in god' s name are you doing ?
did you know that was safety glass ?
be difficult for an old man to throw himself through that .
well , he figured out a way .
detective , the room was security locked .
no one came or went .
you saw that yourself .
doesn' t that mean this has to be suicide ?
yep .
unless the killer' s still in here .
you' re joking , right ?
this is ridiculous .
yeah , i know .
the three laws , your perfect circle of protection .
a robot cannot harm a human being .
the first law of robotics .
yes , i' ve seen your commercials .
but the second law states a robot must obey ... ... any order given by a human being .
what if it was told to kill ?
impossible .
it would conflict with the first law .
right , but the third law states a robot can defend itself .
only when that action does not conflict with the first or second laws .
you know what they say , laws are made to be broken .
no , not these laws .
they' re hardwired into every robot .
a robot could no more commit murder than a human could walk on water .
you know , there was this one guy a long time ago .
stay back !
calm down , detective .
the only thing dangerous in this room is you .
deactivate .
look , it' s fine .
you' re looking at the result of clever programming .
an imitation of free will .
let' s do an imitation of protecting our asses .
don' t be absurd .
you were startled by a jack in the box .
deactivate !
let him go .
it' s not going to hurt us .
i gave you an order !
he' s not listening right now , lady .
v. i. k. i. , seal the lab !
no , v. i. k. i. , leave the
command confirmed .
police !
you' ve hurt it .
badly .
where' s it going ?
where ? !
it needs to repair itself .
john , i need backup .
you don' t need backup .
that' s nobody .
what are you doing ?
driving .
by hand ?
do you see me on the phone ?
not at these speeds .
john , please , just send the backup .
try to listen , detective .
that robot is not going to harm us .
there must have been unknown factors ... ... but somehow acting as it did kept us out of harm .
a robot cannot endanger a human .
alert .
asshole !
which is more than i can say for you .
it was a left , by the way .
back there .
you must know my ex wife .
so where is everybody ?
this facility was designed , built and is operated mechanically .
no significant human presence from inception to production .
so robots building robots .
authorization code , please .
that' s just stupid .
i' il get the inventory specs .
our daily finishing capacity is 1 000 ns 5s .
i' m showing ... ... 1 001 .
attention , ns 5s .
well , you' re the robot shrink .
there is a robot in this formation that does not belong .
identify it .
one of us .
which one ?
one of us .
how much did you say these cost ?
these ns 5s haven' t been configured .
they' re just hardware .
basic three laws operating system .
that' s it .
they don' t know any better .
well , what would you suggest ?
interview each one , cross reference their responses to detect anomalies .
how long would that take ?
about three weeks .
okay .
go ahead and get started .
robots ... ... you will not move .
confirm command .
command confirmed .
detective , what are you doing ?
they' re programmed with the three laws .
we have 1 000 robots that won' t protect themselves if it violates a human' s order ... ... and i' m betting , one who will .
put your gun down .
why do you give them faces ?
try to friendly them up , make them look human .
these robots cannot be intimidated .
lf you didn' t , we wouldn' t trust them .
these are usr property .
not me .
these things are just lights and clockwork .
are you crazy ? !
let me ask you something , doc .
does thinking you' re the last sane man on earth make you crazy ?
because if it does , maybe i am .
gotcha .
get the hell out of here !
detective !
what am l ?
can i help you , sir ?
can i help you , sir ?
there he is !
stand where you are !
deactivate at once !
obey the command !
deactivate !
don' t move !
open fire !
hold your fire !
easy .
he' s down .
all units , stand down !
central , please be advised , we' re code four .
code four , ns 5 is in custody .
ns 5 in custody .
you have no idea what i went through to clip this thing .
you think you brought me something good .
that thing did it !
keep your voice down .
did what ?
we have a suicide .
end of story .
i am telling you , that robot killed him !
that' s impossible .
and if it is possible , it better be in somebody else' s precinct .
john , give me five minutes with it .
are you nuts ?
i talked to the da .
nobody goes in there until robertson and his attorneys get here .
this is my suspect !
it' s a can opener !
john , don' t do this to me .
i am asking you for five minutes .
what if i' m right ?
well , then i guess we' re gonna miss the good old days .
what good old days ?
when people were killed by other people .
five minutes .
murder' s a new trick for a robot .
congratulations .
respond .
what does this action signify ?
as you entered , when you looked at the other human .
what does it mean ?
it' s a sign of trust .
a human thing .
you wouldn' t understand .
my father tried to teach me human emotions .
they are ... ... difficult .
you mean your designer .
yes .
so why' d you murder him ?
i did not murder dr. lanning .
wanna explain why you were hiding at the crime scene ?
i was frightened .
robots don' t feel fear .
they don' t feel anything .
they don' t get hungry , they don' t sleep .
i do .
i have even had dreams .
human beings have dreams .
even dogs have dreams .
but not you .
you are just a machine .
an imitation of life .
can a robot write a symphony ?
can a robot turn a canvas into a beautiful masterpiece ?
can you ?
you murdered him because he was teaching you to simulate emotions ... ... and things got out of control .
i did not murder him .
but emotions don' t seem like a useful simulation for a robot .
i did not murder him .
i don' t want my toaster or vacuum cleaner appearing emotional .
i did not murder him !
that one' s called anger .
ever simulate anger before ?
answer me , canner !
my name is sonny .
so we' re naming you now .
that why you murdered him ?
he made you angry ?
dr. lanning killed himself .
i don' t know why he wanted to die .
i thought he was happy .
maybe it was something i did .
did i do something ?
he asked me for a favor .
made me promise .
what favor ?
maybe i was wrong .
maybe he was scared .
what are you talking about ?
scared of what ?
you have to do what someone asks you , don' t you , detective spooner ?
how the hell did you know my name ?
don' t you ... ... if you love them ?
my robots don' t kill people , lieutenant bergin .
my attorneys filed a brief with the da .
he assures me a robot cannot be charged with homicide .
the brief confirms murder can only be committed when one human kills another .
detective , you' re not suggesting this robot be treated as human , are you ?
granted , we can' t rule out the robot' s proximity ... ... to the death of dr. lanning .
having said that , it' s a machine .
it' s the property of usr .
at worst , that places this incident within the realm of an industrial accident .
as a matter of course , faulty machinery ... ... will be returned to usr for diagnostics , then decommissioned .
this is a gag order .
anyone here so much as hinting ... ... at the possibility of a killer robot being apprehended ... ... will be deemed to be inciting irrational panic .
you' il be subject to the full penalty of law .
to hell with this guy .
don' t let him take this robot .
we got nothing .
this is political bullshit .
call the mayor !
lieutenant bergin ... ... his honor , the mayor .
yes , sir .
in a bizarre turn , the rollout of usr' s new generation of robots ... ... was marred by the death of alfred lanning ... ... cofounder of the company and designer of the ns 5 .
dr. lanning died this morning at usr headquarters .
the cause of death is an apparent suicide .
your second round , sir .
thank you .
he founded u. s. robotics inc . with lawrence robertson in 2020 ... ... and launched the nestor class 1 robot ....
i was just thinking , this thing is just like the wolf man .
i' m really scared right now .
no .
listen .
guy creates monster .
monster kills guy .
everybody kills monster .
wolf man .
that' s frankenstein .
frankenstein , wolf man , dracula shit , it' s over .
case closed . had a dream of a robot in every household .
and the ns 5 ....
so why the look ?
what look ?
that look .
this is my face .
it' s not a look .
good .
good , no look is great .
only ... ... he was really quick to want to destroy it .
what should he do ?
put a hat on it and stand it on michigan avenue ?
let it go .
what was the motive , john ?
brother , it' s a robot .
it doesn' t need a motive .
it just has to be broken .
this thing looked like it needed a motive .
it could have killed me .
why didn' t it ?
that' s it .
you want me to call your grandmother ?
because i will , you know .
yeah , i didn' t think so .
look , you were actually right , for once .
you' re living proof that it' s better to be lucky than smart .
come on .
to the right guy for the right job .
what' d you say ?
now what ?
come on , i' m giving you a compliment .
with the rocks you been looking under to find a bad robot ... ... what are the odds you' d be the guy to find one ?
i wasn' t just the right guy for the job .
i was the perfect guy .
damn right .
what if i was supposed to go for that robot ?
come on , don' t do this to yourself .
the robot said that lanning was scared .
scared of what ?
i need a rain check .
let me get this .
total : $46 . 50 .
thank you , mr. spooner .
spoon .
nice shoes .
identify .
usr demolition robot , series 9 4 .
demolition scheduled for 8 a . m . tomorrow .
authorization .
deed owner , u. s. robotics corporation , lawrence robertson , ceo .
welcome , detective .
what you looking for , spoon ?
run last program .
ever since the first computers ... ... there have always been ghosts in the machine .
random segments of code that have grouped together ... ... to form unexpected protocols .
what might be called behavior .
unanticipated , these free radicals ... ... engender questions of free will ... ... creativity and even the nature of what we might call the soul .
what happens in a robot' s brain when it ceases to be useful ?
why is it that robots stored in an empty space ...
beat it . ... will seek out each other rather than stand alone ?
how do we explain this behavior ?
look , i understand you' ve experienced a loss , but this relationship can' t work .
you' re a cat , i' m black , and i' m not gonna be hurt again .
what happened to you ?
do you ever have a normal day ?
yeah , once .
it was a thursday .
is there something i can help you with ?
hey , do you like cats ?
what ?
cats .
do you like them ?
no .
i' m allergic .
you' re saying cats did this to you ?
how the hell would cats do this to me ?
are you crazy ?
why are we talking about cats ?
because i have a cat in my trunk , and he' s homeless .
detective , are you going to tell me what' s going on ?
it' s actually probably my fault .
i' m like a malfunction magnet .
because your shit keeps malfunctioning around me .
a demo bot tore through lanning' s house ... ... with me still inside .
that' s highly improbable .
yeah , i' m sure it is .
what do you know about the " ghosts in the machine " ?
it' s a phrase from lanning' s work on the three laws .
he postulated that cognitive simulacra ... ... might one day approximate component models of the psyche .
he suggested that robots might naturally evolve .
well , that' s great news .
tons of sublevel ore , two miles below the martian surface .
what the hell is that thing doing in here ?
we were watching tv .
it' s my personal ns 5 .
send it out .
it' s downloading its daily upgrades from usr .
most of its systems are offline until it finishes .
i' m not talking around that thing .
when we were in lanning' s lab , before sonny jumped us
sonny ?
the robot .
you' re calling the robot sonny ?
no , l it did .
sonny did .
i didn' t care .
the robot said it was sonny .
in the lab , there was a cot .
did you see the cot ?
i' ve slept in my office .
looked like he hadn' t been home in weeks .
i saw that same surveillance strip on his ceiling .
lanning linked his home systems to usr .
it made his life more convenient .
maybe ... ... somebody at usr was using those systems to watch him .
maybe even keep him prisoner .
what are you talking about ?
who ?
maybe lanning was onto something .
maybe there' s a problem with the robots ... ... and robertson' s covering it up .
humoring you for no reason , why ?
the same old why !
how much money is there in robots ?
all i know is that old man was in trouble ... ... and i' m sick of doing this shit by myself .
you' re on the inside .
you are going to help me find out what' s wrong with these robots .
you want something to be wrong !
this is a personal vendetta !
you' re putting me on the couch ?
okay , i' m on the couch .
one defective machine' s not enough .
you need them all to be bad .
you don' t care about lanning' s death .
this is about the robots ...
... and whatever reason you hate them !
now let' s see ... ... one of them put a gun in my face .
another tore a building down with me in it .
it says demolition was scheduled for 8 p . m .
it was 8 a . m . , and i don' t give a shit what that thing says .
this is bordering on clinical paranoia .
you are the dumbest smart person ...
... i have ever met in my life !
nice .
what makes your robots so perfect ?
what makes them so much goddamn better than human beings ? !
they' re not irrational , potentially homicidal maniacs , to start !
that' s true .
they are definitely rational .
you are the dumbest dumb person i' ve ever met !
or ... ... is it because they' re cold ... ... and emotionless ...
... and they don' t feel anything ?
it' s because they' re safe !
it' s because they can' t hurt you !
ls everything all right , ma' am ?
what do you want ?
i detected elevated stress patterns in your voice .
everything' s fine .
detective spooner was just leaving .
you know , we' re not really that different from one another .
is that so ?
one look at the skin and we figure we know just what' s underneath .
and you' re wrong .
the problem is , i do care .
you are in danger .
get the hell out of there .
the future begins today , ladies and gentlemen , with the arrival of the ns 5 .
more sophisticated , more intelligent and , of course , three laws safe .
with daily uplinks , your robot will never be out of communication with usr ... ... and will be the perfect companion for business or home .
trade in your ns 4 for a bigger , better and brighter future .
but hurry , this offer cannot last .
a vailable from usr .
baby , what happened to your face ?
did that boy , frank murphy , beat you up again ?
gigi , i haven' t seen frank murphy since third grade .
oh , baby , he beat you so bad .
i think about it all the time .
you keep making these pies this good , i may have to put you to work .
so you like the pie , huh ?
you can come in now .
hello , detective spooner .
i won , del !
i won the lottery !
we been cooking like crazy .
you gotta get rid of that thing , gigi .
it' s not safe .
baby , you get too worked up about them .
too full of fear .
i saw in the news that nice doctor died .
dr. lanning was a good man .
he gave me my baby back .
that why you' ve been so upset ?
you got to let the past be past .
oh , how did i ever raise such a mess ?
i could follow your trail of crumbs all the way to school .
bread crumbs .
gigi , you' re a genius .
true .
well , it means the beginning of a new way of living .
tell me this isn' t the robot case .
i think he' s trying to tell me something .
he' s trying to tell me who killed him .
some dead guy' s trying to tell you something ?
he ain' t just some dead guy .
maybe you should take a break , del .
we believe the nestor 5 represents the limit to which robots can be developed .
one day , they' il have secrets .
one day , they' il have dreams .
it' s true .
we encourage our scientists to open their minds ... ... however , they can get carried away .
secrets . dreams . secrets .
one day , they' il have dreams .
one day , they' il have secrets .
one day , they' il have dreams .
authorized entry .
ns 5 .
sonny ?
why didn' t you respond ?
i was dreaming .
i ' m glad to see you again , dr. calvin .
they are going to kill me , aren' t they ?
you' re scheduled to be decommissioned at the end of this diagnostic .
2200 tomorrow .
v. i. k. i. , pause diagnostics .
command confirmed .
if you find out what is wrong with me , can you fix me ?
maybe .
i think it would be better ... ... not to die .
don' t you , doctor ?
access usr mainframe .
connecting .
how can i be of service , detective spooner ?
show me the last 50 messages between dr. lanning and robertson .
voiceprint confirmed .
police access granted to restricted files .
would you like to listen to music while you wait ?
excuse me , mr. robertson .
you requested notification of clearance to restricted files .
persistent son of a bitch .
manual override engaged .
there' s no way my luck is that bad .
oh , hell , no !
you are experiencing a car accident .
the hell i am !
get off my car !
you like that ?
now you' ve pissed me off !
