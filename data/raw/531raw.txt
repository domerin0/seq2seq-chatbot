we' re gonna have so much fun !
but i need to see you guys out there .

that was this week' s ...
we got a disturbance on elevator 12 , plaza level . ... just moments before his final departure to the island , nature' s last remaining pathogen free zone .
lucky guy , huh ?
you can be a winner too .
the next lottery is tonight .
the next lottery is tonight .
how long have you been here ?
two years .
what about you ?
three .
three .
i' ve been here seven .
if i do the math , that makes me the biggest lottery loser in the room .
i' m such a loser .
sir .
yeah , you .
swipe .
gandu three echo , you' ve been flagged for public disturbance before .
yes , i had a very small emotional outburst , sir .
safe to say it' s over ?
yes , very safe .
i' m feeling much better .
well , then , have a pleasant day .
thank you , you too .
you both have a pleasant day too .
feel the stretch .
one more breath in .
but i was in that section .
no , i don' t understand !
i tried !
i tried to do the best i ...
listen to me !
remember , be polite , pleasant and peaceful .
a healthy person is a happy person .
lincoln six echo , choices are fruit , oatmeal and any type of bran .
no bacon today ?
you got a nutrition flag , means no bacon .
in that case , two eggs , over easy , not too runny , and a side of sausages .
maybe some french toast and a little powdered sugar .
you ain' t cute and i got no time for your lip , six echo .
now , what' s it gonna be ?
move it .
surprise me .
surprise .
yummy .
next .
watch and learn .
next .
jordan two delta .
hi , honey .
hi .
choices are powdered eggs , dried fruit and yogurt .
eggs , please .
ok .
so , where were you the other day ?
we missed you .
that' s nice of you to say , sweetheart .
get you anything else ?
maybe a little bacon .
no , it says i shouldn' t .
go ahead .
four , five pieces , please .
thank you .
well , good luck .
gotta run along now .
you' re not going .
you gotta stay for dinner .
i softened her up for you .
no doubt .
back on your diet ?
you kidding ?
i love this stuff .
better eat up .
you' il need all your strength tonight .
is that a challenge ?
i promise i' il go easy on you .
please separate .
find your seats now .
yeah . " ' who wants sally ? ' said dick .
' i do , ' said jane .
' i cannot find sally .
get up , dick .
get up and help me find sally .
is sally here ? " '
dr. merrick will see you now .
what' d you do wrong this time , tough guy ?
sir ?
you wanted to see me ?
yes .
please .
please , sit down .
so , how is lincoln six echo today ?
not so good , i guess .
why do you say that ?
well , if i' m here , it means i' m not so good .
that' s a rather negative association .
my only job is to see that you' re happy , things are ok with you .
right .
your file shows that you' ve been interacting regularly with jordan two delta .
there' s no law against friendship .
no .
no , we encourage it , but , obviously , proximity could become a concern .
i know the rules of proximity .
you' ve been doing quite well in most other areas .
proficient at work , exercising rigorously .
but screening has picked up some trace levels , changes in your metabolism , and you' ve been having nightmares .
are you saying there' s something wrong with me ?
why don' t you tell me about your dream ?
well , it' s the same dream every time .
i' m on a boat , headed to the island .
a boat ?
what kind of boat ?
a nice boat .
draw it for me , would you ?
so , you are heading toward the island .
what happens then ?
i drown .
really ?
why do you think that is ?
i don' t know .
you tell me .
maybe you' re afraid of winning .
why would i be afraid ?
you tell me .
what' s troubling you , lincoln ?
well , it' s ...
it' s just ...
all right .
tuesday night is tofu night .
and i' m asking myself , who decided that everyone here likes tofu in the first place ?
and what is tofu , anyway ?
and why can' t i have bacon ?
i line up every morning , and i' m not allowed any bacon for my breakfast .
and ...
let' s talk about all the white .
why is everyone wearing white all the time ?
it' s impossible to keep clean .
i always get the gray stripe .
i never get any color .
and i hand it in to be cleaned , and someone cleans it , and folds it neatly back in my drawer , but who ?
who is that person ?
i don' t know .
i just ...
i wanna know answers .
and i wish that there was more .
more ?
yeah .
more than just waiting to go to the island .
lincoln , it' s your nature to question things .
but don' t you realize how lucky you are ?
that you survived the contamination .
that nature has left you a garden of eden to repopulate .
that , lincoln , is your purpose .
right .
and you ?
aren' t you going to the island too ?
no .
my responsibility is to make sure this facility continues to operate .
that' s why people like me , my staff and supervisors , we ... ... we can' t win the lottery .
let me see that .
you draw well .
renovatio . " what does that mean ?
i don' t know .
it' s always in my dream .
i' d like to run some tests on you , lincoln .
what sort of tests ?
nice tests .
come with me .
take a seat .
ok , let' s get you comfortable .
swing back .
i thought these were nice tests .
it' s a synaptic brain scan .
totally harmless .
don' t worry , it' s painless .
it hurts .
not really .
yeah , it does !
no , it doesn' t .
yeah , it really , really does !
the micro sensors will move along your optic nerve .
they' il be uploading readings to us over the next 24 hours , after which , you' il pass them through your urine .
now , that might hurt .
six echo , you' re late .
jones , you ever get bored doing this ?
doing what ?
this .
i never really thought about it .
i think about it a lot .
about what ?
this boring job .
what are we doing here ?
we' re feeding the nutrient lines .
we eat food , food' s gotta have vitamins , right ?
it' s good for us .
you don' t ever wonder about anything ?
where do these tubes go ?
they start there .
and they go ... right there .
hey .
did you get a look at the new guy ?
seven foxtrot .
they found another survivor .
they keep finding them .
he' il probably win the lottery .
straight down , in the hole .
there you go , you try it .
straight down in the hole .
in the hole .
no , no , no .
put it down .
did we all look that stupid when we went through decontamination ?
lottery' s supposed to be random , right ?
right .
what if it' s not ?
what if it' s rigged ?
rigged ?
i' ve been working on this .
here .
take a look at that .
it charts the last 20 people that won a spot on the island .
excluding , of course , the women , picked to be breeders .
what is this ?
i took the first letter in each name .
i assigned it a point value system , based on the alphabet ,
like the last guy , starkweather , s equals 15 .
q equals 15 , s equals 19 .
do you see what i' m saying ?
no .
well , maybe if you would listen to me , i' m trying to tell you .
you string the numbers together .
you divide it by the amount ...
you multiply ...
you divide it by the amount of ...
you divide it ...
you divide it by the amount of people , which is 25 , a thousand plus five , 2500 .
you know what that spells ?
j o n e s.
i' m winning the lottery tonight .
did you pack ?
no .
gentlemen ,
i' m gonna go mess with foxtrot .
there you go .
straight .
straight down in the hole .
there you go .
straight ...
what ?
he had something on his ...
ok .
go .
lima !
are you ok ?
what' s wrong ?
code 15 , we need med techs stat !
lima one alpha .
let' s give her some air , ok ?
you' re gonna be ok , all right ?
relax and breathe .
can i get a wheelchair ?
it' s for lima one alpha .

i think it' s time .
lima , you' re going to the island .
we' re going .
oh , you' re so lucky .
i hope i see you soon .

i' ve been looking ...

i' ve been looking all over for you .
if you go and get yourself contaminated , don' t come pointing the finger at me .
how you doing , mac ?
what are you doing here ?
my chip fried again .
yeah .
how much longer do you think that one' s gonna work ?
what are you two clowns looking at ?
hey , you got any of that stuff on you today ?
oh , look , it' s break time .
come on .
you' re a bad influence on me .
must be why i like you so much .
what' s it like where you live ?
in sector five ?
it' s fine .
you know , it' s like any other sector , i guess .
i like coming out here , talking .
most supervisors don' t like to talk .
yeah .
step into my office .
are these your friends ?
yeah , sometimes .
where are their clothes ?
what' s with dr. merrick ?
you mean why does he act like he' s got a filing cabinet shoved up his ass ?
yeah .
it' s called a god complex .
all doctors are like that .
they think they know everything .
what' s god ?
well , you know when you want something really bad and you close your eyes and you wish for it ?
god' s the guy that ignores you .
oh .
right .
tech service requested in product extraction .
yeah , i' il be right there .
oh , hey .
let me get that .
where do you get that stuff , anyway ?
it' s an old stash .
you know , from before .
you mean from before the contamination ?
yeah .
come on , you' re killing me with questions here .
you got a sweet deal here , you know ?
because you' re , you know , like , special .
why ?
why am i special ?
there' s another question .
you remember what we talked about ?
you don' t tell anybody about our conversations ?
' cause that can get me in big trouble .
no , i don' t .
good .
how' s it going ?
hey , how are you ?
how' s your world ?
ok , i' il catch you later .
chinese junk locked up again , huh ?
yep .
what a surprise .

you' d think with the money this place rakes in
they could afford decent equipment .
yeah .
ready ?
cut the o2 .
seriously , unless you want to see me blow chunks , can you wait till i' m gone ?
sever the umbilical .
cutting .
breathe .
come on , yeah .
that' s it .
come on , breathe .

stim units restricted .
yeah , yeah .
i' il have the veggie stuff .
papassian petal juice , please .

when i was in dr. merrick' s office , i thought i saw your name on a file .
no , i' m fine .
ok .
how are you ?
i' m fine .
lincoln , i can tell when you' re lying
' cause your mouth smiles but your eyes don' t .
i found something .
what ?
a bug .
a bug ?
a flying bug .
can i see it ?
i think it came in the ventilation shaft .
i thought they went extinct with the contamination .
i know .
and how did it get by the pathogen sensors ?
it must be too small .
no , it' s not too small .
how did it survive out there , anyway ?
how does anyone survive ?
they keep finding people , but where do they come from ?
it' s good that they find survivors .
why do you always question the good ?
you only think about the bad .
i just have a feeling that something is wrong .
good things do happen .
i want to see that bug .
hey .
gandu learned a new word from the censor .
what ?
" dude .
dude " ?
what does it mean ?
he just called me dude .
hey , dude .
he said " hey , dude " ?
d o o d. " dude . " hey , dude .

lincoln six echo remains in quarantine after contamination exposure .
jordan two delta was safely transported to her new home on the island .
jones three echo , i need you to concentrate in this lab .
sir , i want to focus more than anything .
i love my job .
it' s interesting .
but lincoln six echo has been contaminated , and it really worries me , because he' s a good friend of mine .
he' s one of my best friends .
my only best friend .
he' il be fine , three echo .
sir , i have one question .
where do all the tubes go ?
the human organism .
unique in all the universe in its complexity .
the product of three billion years of evolution .
perfect in every way , except one .
like all machines , it wears out .
for centuries , the idea of replenishing the human body has been at the forefront of science .
we need to turn this bad day into a good day .
how ?
a terrific day .
by selling .
by selling .
sell , sell , sell .
you start , i finish .
ladies and gentlemen , welcome to the next generation of science , the agnate .
an organic frame engineered directly into adulthood to match the client' s age .
you' re looking at stage one this way , sir .
in its development .
within 12 months it will be harvest ready , providing a carrier for your baby , a second pair of lungs , fresh skin .
all genetically indistinguishable from your own .
and , in compliance with the eugenics laws of 2015 , all our agnates are maintained in a persistent vegetative state .
they never achieve consciousness .
they never think or suffer or feel pain , joy , love , hate .
it' s a product , ladies and gentlemen , in every way that matters , not human .
this is our public relations director , mr. whitman .
he' il be happy to answer any questions .
once again , thank you .
mr. whitman .
i want to talk about the smartest investment you' il ever make .
and i want to tell you how you' re gonna live 60 to 70 years longer .
dr. merrick , albert laurent , blackhawk security .
you come highly recommended by the defense department , mr. laurent .
though i' m unaware of your personal qualifications .
my men are ex delta force .
seals .
i was formerly with the glgn , french special forces .
i understand you had a corporate theft .
yes , that' s what i told the defense department .
the reality is a little more complex .
that' s why i require your services .
we' ve had a ... security breach .
you have the defense department at your disposal .
why call me ?
because their investment here is sizeable .
one hundred and twenty billion dollars , to be exact .
and i can' t afford for them to reconsider .
what you tell them is your business , doctor .
i am in the business of keeping my clients ' confidence .
good .
two of our products have escaped .
impressive , considering they' re vegetative .
well , after several years of trial and error , we discovered that without consciousness , without human experience , emotion , without life , the organs failed .
how long have they been missing ?
four hours and 36 minutes .
they' re on foot ?
yes .
wade , 1 . 2 miles an hour , five mile perimeter ,
standby for suspect description .
we' re on it .
follow me .
come on , we gotta keep going .
i have to stop .
i can' t run anymore .
you gotta try .
where ?
anywhere but here .
but there' s nothing .
everything' s dead , lincoln .
what if we are contaminated ?
then we' d be dead .
there' s no contamination .
it was a lie .
what is it ?
i don' t know .
but it' s alive .
come on .
it' s mean , whatever it is .
let' s rest in here .
jordan two delta' s sponsor , sarah jordan , is in a coma after a car accident .
she' s in need of multiple transplants .
how long does she have ?
forty eight hours .
three days maximum .
tell me about six echo .
he was really the first one to question his environment , his whole existence here .
over the last few months , he began demonstrating unstable behavior and i can' t account for it .
i' m waiting on the result of his synaptic scan .
what do they know about the outside world ?
very little .
we control them with the memory of a shared event .
a global contamination .
it keeps them fearful of going outside .
the island is the one thing that gives them hope , gives them purpose .
everything we expose them to , their programs , their cartoons , books , the games they play , are designed to manage aggression and reinforce simple social skills .
to avoid obvious complications , they aren' t imprinted with an awareness of sex .
we find it simpler to eliminate the drive altogether .
in a very real sense ... they' re like children .
educated to the level of a 15 year old .
what was that ?
i don' t know .
but i want one .
look !
route 39 .
route 39 .
come on .
i got it from a friend .
i think that' s it .
what' s up ?
yeah , do you know a guy named mccord ?
yeah , we know that tool .
who' s asking ?
i am .
and you would be who ?
lincoln six echo .
jordan two delta .
right .
y' all some of those desert ufo freaks ?
u ...
what ?
no , i don' t think so .
no .
mccord ?
well , lucky day , captain kirk .
he' s in the can .
he' s in a can ?
taking a dump .
a dump ?
taking it where ?
bubba , you' re fixing to get on my nerves .
it' s the first door on the right .
thank you .
i have to go .
he' s taking a dump in a can .
something to drink ?
jack ?
yes , please .
straight up ?
oh , that is bitchin ' .
so this is sector five ?
hey !
you son of a bitch !
you knew !
how the hell did you get out ?
why do they lie to us ?
tell me !
they' re gonna be looking for you .
tell me what' s going on !
if anybody sees us together , both of us are gonna be dead .
so , will you just take your hands off me ?
let me ...
let me pull my pants up and i' il take you back to my place so we can be alone .
ok ?
ed .
mac .
give you ... give you boys a minute ?
what ?
this isn' t what it looks like .
sure .
sure .
get out of here , you stupid ...
will you stop ?
you can t just bust in on a guy like that .
that' s really rude .
she doesn' t understand the licking .
you a knucklehead ?
you brought another one ?
excuse me .
hey .
hey , hey !
hey , hey !
back off , joe , ok ?
don' t push me !
no , no , no , that' s no good .
put it on my tab .
we gotta go .
friends from out of town .
come on , sweetheart .
give me your number .
two delta .
hey , look .
get ...
don' t test me .
don' t .
well , this is nice .
mac doesn' t talk much about his work at the institute .
do y' all work with him ?
saving lives and all must be real rewarding .
those are fancy tracksuits .
y' all exercise out in this heat , gonna get yourself nasty heatstroke .
oh , mac , look .
they got matching bracelets .
we should do that , honey .

why do you think merrick has you stuck in an old military bunker below ground ?
he doesn' t want anybody knowing the truth , especially not sponsors .
sponsors ?
the people that had you made .

but why doesn' t merrick want our owners to know that we' re alive ?
just because people wanna eat the burger doesn' t mean they wanna meet the cow .
besides , do you know how many laws merrick' s breaking to have you two hatched ?
your sponsors can' t have any part of that .
they' re like high society , rich and famous .
if they knew , merrick would be out of business .
