i have very high ambitions .
we can do well if everything works down to the smallest detail .
that' s why i have to be very focused .
how best to prepare the riders ?
tour de france is so important for us
and ... if we do it right , we' il make a difference .
i really envy them .
i miss the kick , and the feeling you get when your legs hurt .
but i also miss the feeling of being better than the rest .
having your legs in good shape ... ... and being able to make it hurt for the others .
i really miss that a lot .
fine .
ride up behind the motorcycle .
catch it .
great .
very good , ivan .
after the motorcycle .
catch it .
the last kilometer .
come on !
lance armstrong .
hunting his 6th victory .
beautiful .
come on , come on !
that' s a damn good time .
many times you' re like this when you' re feeling tense .
it' s not easy .
i always spent a lot of time on my bike and my equipment .
so much , sometimes , that it broke down .
i was always trying to get as much as possible out of the components .
then you screw a screw too tight .
or a screw breaks
or a thread is wrecked .
if you don' t screw a screw too tight ten times
you' il never know how far you can screw .
you' re trying to make me say things that aren' t very good .
i' m not making you say ...
no , it' s not that ...
you shouldn' t be sorry about ...
no , i' m not that good at talking about myself .
i can see that this team sounds a little strange .
that' s okay , too .
it' s apparently just my life' s work .
that' s about it .
because that' s how it is .
that doesn' t necessarily make it less exciting .
for myself , either .
this has been ... ... a kind of a hurdle and has been for quite some time .
to get to the point where i' d allow myself do this .
i can' t let myself wonder or worry about
whether others approve of what i' m doing .
the greatest defeat is when others think you' re doing things wrong .
i just should have sprinted myself .
he wasn' t faster than me .
i don' t understand why he didn' t take charge .
i cycled my ass off .
i just should have ridden , myself .
kim said i should stay on his tail .
stay on his tail ?
then that prick came along .
you should have been much more cool .
but then i ...
already before .
he got to ride , too .
you were supposed to .
i did , when he went cold .
but he kept going , anyway .
but he was right on o' grady' s ass .
i' il have to break away again .
not tomorrow .
no , jens will do that .
i' m disappointed , jakob .
i don' t care .
why are you disappointed ?
i' m just kidding .
it was a joke .
do i have any reason to be disappointed ... ?
no .
the yellow t shirt is within reach .
tomorrow you' re riding from the start , piil ... ... as usual .
if he uses all that energy the first week ...
if you hadn' t lost 9 minutes and were in a breakaway every day ...
those breakaways have put me in shape .
i' m impressed .
he' s a star .
he' il win tour de france .
maybe not this year , but one day .
don' t tell him that .
excellent .
it' s deep enough .
dammit .
i couldn' t come under .
i' m training ...
no , no no ...
oh , that .
it' s good .
it' s coming .
it' s before tour de france , you know .
well ...
yes .
you are my friend .
hey , piil ?
there' il be no tour de france for me .
i have to warm the milk bottles ... ... when the baby comes .
no .
i' m going to have twenty ...
no , ten .
with me , eleven .
that' s enough for a football team .
how' s it going ?
it' s going .
my throat' s not so bad , but in general ...
it went reasonably .
yes .
no wind ?
we pulled through well .
everyone was in front .
it was well ridden .
we can' t do anything with that wind .
we can' t come from behind .
jesus christ , ivan .
up in front !
did you see the graphics ?
they have this comic book .
i didn' t see it .
there' s this long field .
a big knife comes down with csc on it
and sticks right through the field .
we' re not working for us postal .
they' ve shown me this .
i understand nothing .
here .
i' m taking it off .
it' s not helping .
our doctor says you have to wear it for at least 5 days .
i don' t need it .
i' m not worried here , because , when i go out of the room
i feel certain i won' t be stabbed in the back .
on other teams , there' d be that chance .
that' s a crucial difference .
you understand ?
i understand everything .
i understand him .
when the british talk , i understand nothing .
a language is something you sing .
one has to be able to understand when it' s sung .
the intonation in the language ...
yes , exactly .
i didn' t say one shouldn' t understand .
after 3 years with us you' il be speaking all languages .
he' s clever , isn' t he ?
you know what this is about , right ?
ow , dammit .
i feel good .
lance , what do you think of the tour ?
hey , piil , come on .
don' t you know who i am ?
okay , lance ...
with the microphone here ... like this .
he didn' t say anything .
shall we bet jens is breaking away ?
i don' t think he is .
i' m in the first line .
i' m going to get going .
yes ...
hi .
i know he needs help .
of course he does , but how much can i help him ?
i know i have to leave him alone .
i can' t push him too hard .
it' s a difficult balancing act to do the right thing for him
and it' s very hard to do the right thing for him just now
because he' s very frustrated .
that' s easy enough to understand .
it' s frustrating for us , too
because he' s an important man .
i go 360 .
you know ...
i know .
i tell you .
hey , bjarne .
i have ten kilos less than ivan .
ivan is 450 .
i' m training .
not racing .
and you also .
i' m not like this , bjarne .
the computer needs to understand me .
i don' t need to understand it .
it' s more intelligent than me .
yeah , yeah , for sure ... not maybe .
i won' t force him .
not at all .
i' il have to push him if nothing happens in a month' s time .
he has to make some decisions in his life .
he has to .
i can' t do it for him .
there' s not much time .
not to do everything .
it' s difficult ...
we' re doing a lot .
it' s necessary to work well .
if it works ...
the most important is the time from dauphin libr to tour de france .
those are twenty very important days .
polish everything up and achieve the maximum .
i feel pain .
this part and in the gluteus .
i don' t feel good .
i have pain .
i' m here because i have pain .
he' s feeling a bit strange right now .
i don' t know how great his need is .
he must assess what he' s capable of .
he can' t change what' s happened .
the problem is , there are too many people around him on the home front
who don' t understand that life goes on .
it' s a great strain on him .
he has to take them all into consideration
and you can' t do that as a professional bike rider .
you just can' t .
very good !
nice work .
nice work , jakob .
my life' s greatest wish
was to ride together to the finish line in the mountains
and sprint for the win .
we had the chance in vuelta de espaa 2001 .
but in the interest of the team ...
we were together in the breakaway .
but my team ordered me to wait for joseba beloki .
we could have shared that dream .
it wasn' t mine , alone .
jos is someone with whom i' ve shared a lot .
he' s been like my big brother for the last eight years .
i' ve spent more time with him than with my own brothers .
he was someone i admired because of his perseverance .
there are people without much experience
and with very little personality
but who have a lot of money .
it' s very attractive for these kinds of wolves
and people who don' t think like us .
we see the world in a different way .
we' re stubborn because it' s a hard sport .
but we' re not built for a world that is organized differently .
when these people come into your world
it' s easy for them to destroy your life .
the first time i heard of his problem was a day earlier , in the media .
at one point i was afraid it was over .
but luckily ...
for me , he' s one of the world' s absolute best bicycle riders .
he' s much better than people think ...
much better .
it requires more of you than just enjoying your sport .
it' s important for me
that there' s a very good relationship
between carlos and you .
very important .
because if you show that you' re getting along well together
everyone' s happy .
it' s important for everyone .
otherwise there' il be two teams .
i don' t want that to happen .
the two of them mean a lot to me personally
but also for the team .
they' re my two stars .
i have to feel my way .
it' s hard to have two , who in theory are competing against each other
become the best of friends .
my greatest wish
is for them to be able to see each other' s resources
and take advantage of them and make each of them better .
i will press them to give absolutely all they can .
you can often do much more than you think .
but the last thing i want to do is push them too far .
danish csc have now parked their bicycles
and french journalists are wondering how they succeeded .
that' s a direct accusation against me .
yes .
it' s serious .
they should come to the training camp and see how we work
in december , january and february .
an italian trainer has been named .
he has previously been under suspicion .
a french journalist says he' s a trainer for csc .
that is correct .
one more question .
is his name " cecchini " ?
he' s a very close friend .
a friend for life .
we develop many things together .
he trains some of my riders .
there' s very strict control .
i can' t tell you if there still are many who cheat .
i won' t reveal names .
i simply can' t .
my name would be ruined .
that' s why we have such strict rules .
that' s important .
i' ve spoken with a guy from tour de france .
he says that tomorrow ... ... the whole story about di luca will be out .
3 more names will be made public tomorrow . lncluding yours .
mine ?
yes .
speak with assano .
my case is finished and awaiting judgement .
i explained to him that it was a medicine for headaches .
nothing more .
that' s all it is .
i said that if there were other things , you knew the consequences .
i' m sorry ... ... that my name has been involved again .
it' s not fair for the tour , the team , or for me .
unfortunately , in this sport ... ... if someone rides fast , it' s because ... ... they' re probably doing this and that .
what should we do about it ?
the american , lance armstrong !
right now i ought to be thinking about things like contracts
and sponsors , et cetera .
but i can' t handle it right now .
it' s a shame , because we' re in a situation with the sponsors
where i' m not completely free .
i can' t do what i' d like to do .
where' s the balance ?
how much do i have to sacrifice , myself ?
it' s the fourth year , now .
i can' t keep making so many sacrifices and not get anything out of it .
that doesn' t put food on the table .
up to the front , ivan .
now .
i haven' t been in the best shape , physically .
i' ve had headaches .
i don' t know exactly what it is .
it can be stress .
it can be so many things .
i' ve been having headaches ...
no cars can get through here .
this is no good !
they can' t be so close behind .
does he want to change bikes ?
try adjusting it .
it' s sitting like this .
push him .
andrea , do you want to change bikes , or what ?
come on , andrea !
no bottle .
why the hell did he go down there first ?
the first day is just as intense for me as for the riders .
you' il have to look , yourself .
yeah , yeah .
that was completely wrong .
it would be a good idea to test the bike first .
this has a lot to do with stress .
i know how fast everything can fall apart .
a big accident for csc .
new problems .
do you want to change bikes ?
how are we going to be able to win ?
this is tour de france .
you don' t have a chance if you don' t use your head .
jesus .
i can' t understand how he dares .
my god , what a sprint !
look at this ...
no !
it was kurt .
fuck !
why didn' t you come before ?
i was down with sabine .
haven' t you taken others , ole ?
no .
he' s just arrived .
now an hour' s gone by .
there are some others who must be looked at .
it' s very hard to tell ...
then find another one , ole .
half an hour ago they said he' d come in 2 minutes .
then you' d better find him .
he was three seconds behind .
we' ve just lost a minute .
if you' re not together with the group , you get the real time to armstrong .
so he loses 45 seconds .
a bit more .
that can' t be true .
it' s in the rules .
he' s furious .
we' il have to protest .
if we made a complaint , what would it be based on ?
that it' s hopeless to make the last 100 meters on cobblestones .
so they should makes exceptions ?
yes , i think so .
they' re the ones who decided to put the finish line there .
ole , it doesn' t matter whether he' s four minutes behind , or forty .
do you want a cup of coffee ... ?
okay .
you don' t want one either , ole ?
no .
excuse me ...
ole ?
ow , that hurts .
ow !
it' s your bile .
that helped a lot .
to be quite honest
there have been ... ... some situations that have been hard for me to tackle .
i' ve known you for several years .
i think ... ... sometimes it takes so little
to make one feel
that it' s good one is here .
try smiling .
but you know me , ole .
i' ve never seen you like this , bjarne .
i don' t know what it is .
i' m just focused .
i' m here to ...
i think many of us take it as though there' s something' s wrong .
that we' re doing something wrong .
no .
i' m glad to hear it .
there isn' t .
it means a lot to me to know that what i do is good enough .
otherwise you wouldn' t be here .
that' s why you' re here .
you know that , too .
even though you' re stressed ...
just a little ...
do you have so much on your mind ?
it' s filled up .
then you have to let people know you need help .
that is ...
i know you' re used to fighting alone .
but if things are too much ...
a little sign .
then we can help you .
we can' t do your work , but at least we feel we' re part of something .
you talk about teamwork , right ?
you need help , too .
yeah , yeah .
and support .
i' m saying this as a friend .
i' m afraid people feel rejected when you close yourself off like this .
that isn' t what you want , of course .
they' re ready tomorrow .
they have to be .
we have to win .
there' s the first one .
i' ve re named him .
he' s not " the little bird " .
now he' s " the little eagle " .
eighteen days .
no , not at the moment .
she' s okay now .
she' s helping my wife .
when are you coming , poppa ?
are you nervous ?
peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers .
can you say " ole kaare fli " ?
" you are nice and beautiful .
am i nice and beautiful ?
yeah , i know .
like a boxer .
it' s not easy .
c' est la vie .
you know , " c' est la vie " ?
no .
that' s life .
it' s french , ole .
tour de france isn' t the best time to close myself off .
that' s fine .
but if i need to sometimes , i should be allowed to .
i just need to be helped out of it again .
i can tell from my eyes that i' m tired .
it' s an incredibly hard sport .
perhaps the hardest you can get into .
maybe there are many who have learned how to fight
before they became professional bicycle riders .
i have .
some people can' t live up to their expectations and those of others .
they create incalculable burdens for themselves .
there are those who are mentally unable to get a grasp on their lives .
they don' t get help at the right time .
they' re not good at asking for it .
they can' t pull themselves together when it' s necessary .
they become losers .
and then sometimes tragic things happen .
it' s a damn hard sport .
it requires willpower .
everything can change in a split second .
this can' t happen .
i think carlos called .
i think carlos called you .
we can' t , right now .
bobby had been looking forward to the tour
and was on his way to a good result
for both himself and the team .
suddenly it' s all lying on the asphalt .
i can' t ride anymore .
must you ride with that on tomorrow ?
i don' t want to .
tomorrow you shouldn' t .
it' s better if it gets air .
it' il create too much wind resistance .
it has a hell of an effect on you .
falling down , time after time .
anyone else would have given up long ago .
it hurts here .
i have pain here .
i have pains in my stomach .
it' s not going to be easy today .
i' m completely wrecked .
i can' t pedal anymore !
good , jakob !
there' s only one thing to do ...
you have to .
what ?
you have to .
if you can' t ride , you can' t ride .
that' s all there is to it .
are you going home ?
good luck .
give ' em hell .
i' il try .
don' t ride too much .
hello .
ivan broke down on the first rest day .
he was told his mother was seriously ill with cancer .
i tried to console him a bit .
we drove back to the hotel .
we agreed to assemble all the riders .
ivan explained the situation .
he intended to continue .
it was very important that they trust each other .
they had to be loyal to him .
it' s important that they supported him .
you know what , bjarne ?
i' ve spoken to my mother .
if this is fate , what do i do now ?
it' s hard not to see my daughter and wife for a month .
i prefer to see my daughter and my mother when i come home .
they say they' il give her chemotherapy so she' s not in pain .
but she' s getting closer to death every day .
lance isn' t dumb .
he' s really cunning .
that' s why he' s won the tour six times .
he' s a really good rider .
really excellent .
but he also uses his head .
tactically , he' s really clever .
part of it is also a question of psychology .
i spoke with him yesterday .
we had a talk
if you stick with me friday and saturday , you' il end near the top .
why ?
he said he was going to win the tour on friday and saturday .
he' s convinced he' il leave everyone behind .
he' s going to win both stages ...
i know that .
it was important for me to be present .
i let him know that , whatever happens , we' re backing him up .
i always write some information about the stage
on my handlebars .
i usually also write down other things .
that day i wanted to win .
i wanted to create something meaningful
for the people who care about me .
there was my family situation in particular .
try to do something for her .
that was the day she was supposed to begin the chemotherapy .
the 3 names are my mother' s , my wife' s and my daughter' s .
this way they' re close to me .
ivan' s next to armstrong , who' s attacking .
what a race .
the first time i attacked , it was to split the field
and to see who could keep such a fast pace up the mountain .
armstrong has fallen back .
ivan' s broken away with mancebo .
there have been many important moments .
but the important thing here was that i had it all in my head .
i wasn' t very afraid
because i knew that bjarne would help me .
at one point i saw a tv where there were three men in front .
my two boys , ivan and carlos , with lance in the middle .
it was a great feeling .
really great .
i was very proud .
stay on his wheel .
stay on his wheel , ivan .
ride , ivan , ride .
good !
come on , ivan !
come on , ivan .
let' s go , basso .
show us what you can do .
armstrong and basso ...
i think it was the greatest moment of my career .
good , good , good !
that was amazing .
he didn' t even look tired .
may i borrow your telephone ?
call my wife and tell her ivan won .
ivan won .
armstrong came in second .
hello , mom .
it' s me .
are you alone ?
perfect ...
perfect .
good , good ...
hi .
thank you .
that was beautiful .
congratulations .
and to you , too .
i' m happy for ivan .
very happy .
because he tried a lot .
i saw him ...
i asked him because i saw he was really good .
he was in the right position .
so i tried .
the others , like tyler hamilton , were finished .
what do you say , bjarne ?
fantastic .
that was lucky .
now you don' t need rubber bands .
are you happy , ivan ?
yes .
we' ve got a chance if we keep on like this .
it went great , of course .
but it sure as hell wasn' t easy .
i could see that right away .
well , but ...
you were tenacious .
yes , i' m satisfied .
we handled things well .
i' ve spoken with one of armstrong' s friends .
he gave me a number .
what did lance say ?
he was glad you were there .
because ... ... everyone knows it was an important day for you .
everyone knows that .
yes , yes .
he' s letting armstrong win .
he can' t do that .
he won yesterday , you know .
we have to be careful not to accept lance' s terms .
if we' re going to beat lance , it has to be on our own terms .
if he can imprint in ivan' s mind how he should ride
we won' t beat him .
he' s had it a little too easy .
fifteen and a half kilometers long .
this is how it looks .
i don' t think about anything .
i ride as i' ve been doing the past 5 days .
it' s total chaos .
people running in front of the riders , hitting cars .
there are no barricades .
he promised to divide it up in two kilometers .
go , carlos !
go , go , go !
shout to the motorcycle .
you' il catch him in ten minutes .
motorcycle !
i was afraid someone would step out in front of me .
what a bunch of idiots !
this is unbelievable !
motorcycle !
armstrong' s right there .
ride through , ivan , ride !
armstrong' s on his way , ivan .
remember your breathing .
go , ivan .
it' s not over yet !
it' s not over yet .
ride !
i feel like jumping onto ivan' s bike and pedaling like hell .
give him a push .
do whatever i can .
at the same time , i' m really impressed .
it looks really great when he comes whizzing by .
anything can happen .
it takes so little to change the whole situation .
i don' t think he expected to catch ivan .
he' d expected ivan to give him a run for his money .
so did l .
and that' s what ivan does , when he' s giving it all he' s got .
i think he was a little surprised to see us so soon .
maybe he was relieved to see ivan go down
because he knew he was dangerous .
ivan was the one he had to watch out for .
come on , ivan .
stay there !
stay behind him !
don' t be afraid !
ride , now .
ride , ride , ride !
i thought i could win the tour
until the night before .
it doesn' t matter , ivan .
it' s all right .
i don' t feel well .
things can only get better .
do you know what times jens , peter and bobby had ?
in relation to basso , so we can compare .
what was carlos ' time ?
we were lacking what was there the other days .
it wasn' t a great day .
no .
i expected to ride better .
but i wasn' t that bad .
it didn' t go too well .
hi .
come over here .
you were noisy last saturday .
daddy' s leg hurts .
can' t you stroke my leg ?
no , mine .
can you stroke daddy' s leg ?
stroke it .
it hurts a lot .
show what daddy does when he wins .
if it' s ever going to happen ... it' il take years .
i' m in good physical shape .
i can feel the motor , but the rest ...
don' t think about it now .
i feel bad .
not so much for myself , but for the rest of you .
for myself ...
michele ...
i know you haven' t achieved what you set out to do .
life' s not over when your career' s over .
that' s when life begins .
what should i do after my career' s finished ?
i' d like you all to think it over a bit .
it' s not enough that i' m the only one who knows this philosophy .
when you' re with some people more than those you really care about ... ... it' s a huge privation .
it' s not reasonable , somehow .
how long can you take it ?
you can only take it so long as what you' re doing is fun ... ... and it draws a response .
something has to make it worth it .
otherwise it' s completely impossible .
you start thinking negatively .
it puts you somewhere else then where you should be .
alessandra has given me invaluable support .
i' ve always felt she' s been very close to me throughout my career .
she' s never let me down .
not even for a week .
she has always given me moral support .
she didn' t pay as much attention to me when my daughter was born .
of course .
there' s never been a victory that has made me as happy
as when my daughter was born .
there' s no comparison .
naturally , all my victories
bring out many feelings in me .
but it can' t be compared with my family at all .
i haven' t spoken much with you yet .
but i want you to know the team means a lot to me .
of course it' s not the same for you .
because it' s your team .
so it means a lot to me .
but once in a while you have to ...
don' t talk so much .
i don' t know you so well .
you have a strong character .
it' s not so easy to sit and talk about .
you can tell me everything .
with no exceptions .
i know you' d like to go home .
you just have to say it .
you can trust me .
i trust you .
i always knew i was able to win .
in a different way .
some thought it was beautiful .
others have criticized it .
i' ve always tried to do something different .
win in a different way .
maybe i' ve also lost some races in this way .
at the moment i prefer
to live my life without thinking to much about
how things could have been .
it' s all right to live and take one day at a time .
but of course the good thoughts blend in with the bad .
the good moments are what' s left .
the victories ... ... togetherness ...
i was hoping for a good result .
of course .
but there' il be other races .
don' t say that .
but , still ...
it' il be all right .
during the race i didn' t feel anything .
but when they started riding hard ... ...
i lacked that extra something .
it also had to do with being nervous .
getting results .
you shouldn' t think so much about it .
bye , we' il talk later .
okay .
bye .
the fate of the team depends a lot on me .
of course it does .
is it dangerous that they' re extras in my little show ?
that' s also something to think about .
i going to get drunk tonight .
my wallet ...
where the hell did i leave it ?
there are many things i have learn to do better .
i have to be better at giving compliments .
it' s something ... ...
i want to have more energy to do .
this is something you have to train yourself to do .
train yourself to be a better man and a better father .
but you need the time and have to make priorities .
i don' t think i' ve been good enough at this .
but ... it' s something i have to work on .
what we have now can' t be taken from us .
we should just be proud .
what does daddy do when he wins ?
that asshole !
was it nice ?
yes .
one day it' il be me standing on that top step .
it was good ... ... but in our own way , right ?
no ... 65 .
it' s 64 .
and you ?
62 .
you liar .
how tall are you then ?
