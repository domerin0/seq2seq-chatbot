kids , in life there are a lot of big romantic moments .
and they make life worth living .
but here' s the problem : moments pass , and lurking just around the corner from those moments is a cruel , unshaven bastard named reality .
and so , back in 2006 , on the night of claudia and stuart' s wedding , reality was the enemy .
wow .
the peace corps ?
yeah .
i ship out tomorrow two years .
you know , some people say the peace corps is the most noble thing a person can do .
to those people , i say , " is it ?
and usually they say , " yes , it is .
barney , they are so right .
i wish there was something i could do .
oh , tanya ...
i' m so glad you said that .
this wasn' t how i' d thought the night would turn out .
this was finally supposed to be my big moment with robin .
but then reality came along .
robin got called up last minute to anchor the 11 : 00 news .
it was her big break .
and i went to the wedding stag .
then , when i least expected it ...
hey , where the hell did you disappear to last night ?
i had the most amazing night ever .
tell me about it .
that cake .
best cake i ever had .
seriously .
my stomach was , like ,
hey , bro , i don' t know what you' re eating , ' cause i don' t have any eyes , but it' s basically awesome , so keep sending it down gullet alley .
yeah , i know .
my stomach was , like , " girlfriend , we don' t always get along , but that cake ...
lily .
oh , right .
most amazing night ever , " and go .
you know , i should tell you , i have a rule .
i never hook up at weddings .
i' m guessing you haven' t always had this rule .
well , here' s the thing , those big romantic moments , they' re great when they happen , but they' re not real .
exactly , exactly like like just now , when i saw you doing the chicken dance out there ,
i' m not gonna lie to you , big time thunderbolt .
mm .
you should see me tap dance .
you' d be down on bended knee .
sadly not out of character .
but i know now it' s just a mirage .
wedding goggles .
exactly .
and that , in a nutshell , is why i' m not putting the moves on you .
this isn' t the moves ?
what , you ... you think this is the moves ?
believe me , you' d know the moves .
people ten tables away would know the moves .
oh , that' s too bad .
tell me about it .
you know , i think ...
i have a solution .
interested .
and to preface this , we' re not gonna sleep together tonight .
less interested .
go ahead .
okay .
so the thing that always screws it up is the next day .
right ?
so ...
why don' t we just cut that part out ?
what are you saying ?
i' m saying , i' m here , you' re here , this is a big romantic wedding why don' t we just dance and have a great time , and then when it' s over , never see each other again .
unless ...
no .
no unless .
no e mails , no phone numbers , not even names .
tonight we will make a memory that will never be tarnished .
and then ... when we' re old and gray , we' il look back on this night and it' il be perfect .
wow .
okay , i' m in .
okay .
i guess , uh , what , we' il need fake names ?
um ... you can call me buttercup .
pleased to meet you , buttercup .
i' m ...
lando calrissian .
wow , this is kind of exciting .
our names will forever be shrouded ...
ted , ted , ted .
look , i got a bridesmaid .
ted , look , look , ted , the second hottest bridesmaid .
ted , look .
see ya , ted .
so , i' m ted .
victoria .
but no last names .
no last names .
oh , what is wrong with you ?
dude , that is just , like ... a weenie ass idea .
no , it was awesome i had a great night ,
i' m never gonna see her again , and there' s no way to ruin it .
ted , how do i explain this to you ?
last night i ate the best cake of my life .
now , you think i' m gonna let that cake out of my life ?
hell , no .
i' m gonna find out what bakery made that cake , and then i' m gonna get some more cake .
that cake really got to you , huh ?
it haunts me .
so , what happened next ?
okay .
ground rules have been established .
now let' s see some of these moves i' ve heard so much about .
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
let' s do all the single ladies in this joint a big favor and steal the bouquet .
yes , but we' il need ... a diversion .
kiss !
kiss !
kiss !
kiss !
kiss !
go , go , go , go , go , go , go .
so that' s what happened to the bouquet .
you know , good for victoria .
it' s such an evil tradition .
you' re not gonna do it at your wedding ?
hell , yeah , i' m gonna take that flower grenade and chuck it into the crowd and scream , " crawl for it , bitches !
that' s just what girls do .
so , where' d you guys go ?
very nice .
yeah ?
okay , i don' t really know how to tap dance .
i couldn' t tell .
really .
well , it' s too bad you' re not gonna get some tonight .
oh , if i wanted some , i could get some .
no , you couldn' t .
you' re a dude .
i could get some .
you could totally get some .
we' re not gonna kiss tonight .
if if we kiss , all of this becomes real .
you you might use too much tongue .
i might not use enough .
and then suddenly , poof , spell' s broken .
i will use exactly the right amount of tongue .
okay , how about this ?
the best part of any first kiss is the lead up to it .
the moment right before the lips touch .
it' s like a big drumroll .
so ... how about tonight , we just stick with the drumroll ?
okay .
but we can' t kiss .
okay .
a drumroll ?
that' s it ?
so , what , you just ... you said good night , came home and ... performed a drum solo ?
oh , ted , you' re such a doof !
i mean , this girl sounds amazing .
she was completely amazing .
she was amazing and funny , and we connected on every level , and i' m never gonna see her again .
damn it , i have to see her again !
yes !
yes !
so let' s get to work , man .
what else do you know about her ?
nothing .
her name' s victoria that' s all i got .
wait , claudia , claudia would know .
well , claudia' s on her honeymoon .
she' il be back in two weeks call her then .
yes , two weeks .
good idea .
i' m calling her now .
no , ted , you don' t mess with a honeymoon .
yeah , come on , dude .
ask her about the cake .
ted ?
hey , claudia !
great wedding , beautiful toast , touching stuff .
how' s the honeymoon ?
listen , i' m calling because last night i met this girl , and i was wondering if you had ...
oh , you have got to be freaking kidding me !
aw , here we go .
24 hours ago , you were begging ... begging me to bring some other girl to my wedding , and now , well , uh , you' re over her ?
i' ve moved on ?
what was her name ?
is it my fat cousin lindsay ?
don' t be embarrassed she has pretty eyes .
uh , no .
her name was victoria .
i don' t know her last name .
well , lucky for you , i know that guest list backwards and forwards .
thank god .
unlucky for you , there was no victoria at my wedding .
good bye , ted .
there was no victoria at the wedding .
maybe she used a second fake name .
oh , she' s good , she' s very good .
maybe she was ghost .
that' s why she didn' t want to kiss you because you' d just pass right through her and feel really cold for a second .
oh , my god , i just had a great idea for a screenplay .
marshall ... she was not a ghost !
i know that she wasn' t a ghost .
she picked up a bouquet , proving she had corporeal form .
wait wait !
she was sitting across from a couple of bridesmaids .
she must' ve been at their table .
maybe they know who she was .
great .
so how do we get in touch with the bridesmaids ?
this better be good i am about to enter nirvana .
by the way , i should get you nirvana' s phone number .
she gives a great massage .
say what ? !
barney !
ow !
i know the house rules .
es un chiste !
listen , barney , i saw you talking to that bridesmaid last night .
did you happen to get her phone number ?
you know i did .
great !
um , i' m gonna need you to call her for me .
you know i won' t .
why not ?
because we just hooked up last night .
i can' t call the girl the next day .
i have to wait at least , like ... forever .
oh , snap !
never gonna call her .
besides , she thinks i' m on my way to india .
oh , come on , barney , it' s for a good cause .
uh , ted going all castrati over yet another girl is exactly not a good cause .
sorry , buddy , i wish i could help you my hands are tied .
oh , no , wait that was last night .
okay , barney , i' il tell you what i' m going to do .
you make this call and i will go with you ... to foxy boxing .
really ?
yeah .
but you always said the foxy boxing girls were neither foxy not good at boxing .
i' m ready to be proven wrong .
tonight ?
tonight .
dial .
yeah , tanya , turns out i don' t leave for the peace corps till tomorrow .
yeah , i know .
it sucks .
just one fewer day i get to help people .
anyway , this girl any idea who she was ?
hold on .
what kind of shoes was sh ...
no , tanya , he' s a dude .
he' s not going to know what kind of shoes she was wearing .
actually ...
oh , come on .
hey !
so what do you want to do next ?
don' t think .
first thing that comes into your mind .
hold ... this ... and this ...
whoa !
there she goes .
apparently she was wearing brown shoes ... ... with little snowflakes on them .
yeah , they do sound cute .
any idea who ... ?
okay .
well , thanks anyway .
yeah , you take ca ...
what' s ... ?
tonight ?
well , i' m shipping out pretty early , so i won' t be able to stay over , but , yeah , sure , i' d love to .
okay .
i' il talk to you later .
sorry , ted , i won' t be able to make foxy boxing tonight .
i understand .
okay , uh , let' s not lose hope .
we' il call the hotel .
maybe she was staying there .
we' il have them check the registry for anyone named victoria .
or maybe she goes by vicky or tori ...
or ictor .
she probably doesn' t go by " ictor .
no , you know what ?
this is fate .
i am never supposed to see this girl again .
that was the whole point of the night .
i have just been saved from myself .
let' s drink many beers .
agreed .
and i thought that was the end of it .
but then ...
hey !
there' s the anchor lady !
how was it ?
oh , i don' t know .
why don' t you ask the new substitute weekend anchor ?
robin ?
thanks , robin !
it was awesome .
back to you , robin .
congrats !
that' s so cool !
yeah , i felt really bad bailing on ted , though .
oh , don' t even worry about it .
in fact ...
and then lily told her the whole story , right down to the brown shoes with the little snowflakes on them .
and by the end of it ...
what ?
i know who she is .
you know who she is ?
but you weren' t even at the wedding .
actually , i kind of ... was .
what ?
well , after the newscast , i was so excited
i decided to surprise ted by going to the reception .
oh , damn it !
oh , stop it !
what the hell !
hello ?
you okay in there ?
uh , yeah , i' m fine .
um ...
just allergies or something .
i' m fine .
listen , do you ... want to come and cry out here ?
i' ve been told i' m an excellent hugger .
oh , thanks .
but i don' t actually cry in front of people or ... cry at all , for that matter .
oh , man , it' s gross .
does everyone snot up this much when they cry ?
hey , you' re speaking to a fellow snotter .
so , why are you crying ?
because you have feelings for ted .
i don' t know .
maybe ?
okay , what is wrong with the two of you !
seriously !
he likes you and you like him .
and j j just be together !
cheese louise !
happiness is not that difficult !
look , okay , yes .
i cried in the bathroom and that ... was weird .
but that doesn' t mean i' m in love with the guy .
the fact is , i i don' t know how i feel .
yes , you do !
seeing him with someone else and crying about it ?
guess what ?
that' s how you feel .
that is nothing but how you feel .
okay , fine .
i have feelings for him .
happy ?
kinda , yeah .
but it doesn' t change anything .
i still don' t want to get married and he' s still ...
ted .
what i should do is just tell him who victoria is so he can be happy .
or you could tell him that you' re into him and then you could both be happy .
i' m going to go find him .
well , wait .
which one are you going to tell him ?
i have no idea .
and here' s the most amazing part
because i told her i' d converted all my money to india dollars , she gave me 50 bucks to take a cab to the airport .
that' s right .
i just got paid for sex .
i really should give this money to the peace corps .
they' ve done so much for me lately .
hi , guys .
hey .
um , ted , can i talk to you outside for a second ?
yeah , sure .
what' s up ?
um ...
i , uh , i have to tell you something .
oh ...
oh , just get it .
hello ?
ted ?
it' s stuart .
my lovely bride would like to say something to you .
ted ...
i' m sorry i hung up on you earlier .
my new husband , and the vodka cranberry , which cost $10 . 50 at the freakin ' airport bar ...
when is this plane going to board ? !
sweet pea ?
... have helped me realize that sometimes i can act like a crazy person , and i don' t want my new husband to think i' m a crazy person .
it' s fine , claudia , don' t worry about it .
oh , um , marshall wanted to know where you guys got that cake .
the cake ?
why don' t you take this ?
sounds like you could use it .
thanks .
you' re very sweet .
so are you a friend of the bride or groom ?
we got it at this little bakery downtown .
actually neither .
it' s called the buttercup bakery .
pleased to meet you , buttercup .
i made the cake .
she made the cake .
she wasn' t on the guest list because she wasn' t a guest .
she made the cake .
she made that cake ?
ted , this is the girl .
you got to marry her .
today .
she has to move in with us .
i' m going down to that bakery .
no , no .
don' t do it .
baby , what are you talking about ? !
yeah , all day long you been busting my apple bag about finding this girl .
well , i i just think that ... that maybe she' s not that into you .
and and that' s why she didn' t give you her number .
robin ?
care to chime in with anything ?
yes .
ted ...
go get her .
going .
getting .
ted , oh , my , gosh , i love this moment .
you know why ?
' cause i' m going to say it , and this time , you' re actually going to say yes .
you ready ?
you ready to say yes ?
ted , suit up .
yes !
no .
oh , come on !
whoa .
guess we were gone a while .
oh , that' s too bad .
i was looking forward to one last dance .
well , yes , i am .
sorry , i could tell what you were just thinking .
wow , what was i just thinking ?
damn , he' s looking mighty fine in that tux .
you got me .
you are good .
yeah .
mmm .
you know , i don' t look like this every day .
on a real weekend , the real ted wears a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt with bleach stains on it .
mmm .
the real ted sounds real sexy .
too bad i' il never get to see it .
buttercup bakery .
this is it .
good luck , dude .
grab me a cupcake .
ted ?
you still with us ?
tell me your last name .
you know there' s one little flaw in our plan .
what' s that ?
i' m going to go home tonight with a lot of great memories and one really sucky memory .
the memory of you walking out that door .
hey , ted .
yeah ?
close your eyes ... and count to five .
one ... two ... three ... four ... five .
and to our dying days we' il remember everything about that night as perfect .
maybe we both need that .
i mean , so many things go wrong in life but this is the one thing that never will .
it will always ... always be pure unadulterated awesome .
and if i walk in there , i' m robbing both of us ...
the meter' s running , dude .
crap or get off the pot .
yeah , yeah , i' m going .
oh , thank god .
