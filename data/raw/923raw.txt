oliphant v. oliphant , relevance to chapman ...
she said she took the kids to tahoe ?
that' s right .
wait , which side oftahoe ?
she' s on some kind of cruise .
yeah , well , if the cruise goes all the way around the lake , she' s left the state and she' s in breach .
tell wrigley to prepare a filing to attach .
a filing to attach .
what do you want in it ?
everything .
primary residence , beach house , ski cabin , auto , stocks , bonds , dental floss .
everything .
uh huh .
gonna lose ya .
uh huh .
and tell fred armatrading that we finally have pictures of his wife with the oral surgeon .
oh , and get a fruit and pastry basket in the conference room for my 9 : 30 .
didn' t have time for breakfast .
where are you ?
comin ' at ya .
your 9 : 00 is here .
bonnie donaly .
bonnie donaly .
mrs. donaly .
hmm .
mm hmm .
hmm .
yes , your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures , and , yes , absent a swimming pool , the presence of a pool man would appear to be suspicious .
but , madam , who is the real victim here ?
let me suggest to you the following .
your husband , on a prior occasion , had slapped you ... beat you .
i think that word is not inappropriate .
no , i ...
let me finish , please .
i' m not concerned with who slapped whom first .
your husband , who had beaten you repeatedly ...
no , he never ...
please ... repeatedly , was at the time brandishing your firearm .
it was his gun .
and we' il get it back for you .
trying , in his rage , to shoot an acquaintance , a friend of long standing .
they never really cared for each other .
and if not for your cool headed intervention , his tantrum might have ended this schmo' s life and ruined his own .
as for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined took place , wasn' t it in fact he ... who was sleeping with the pool man ?
no ?
am i going too far here ?
were his sexual ...
no .
i don" t ...
sorry .
i' m not omniscient .
the point is that he acted upon an assumption which he cannot prove , and i take it you deny .
well ...
fine .
i' il take the case .
it" s imperative that i meet with oliver olerud before we proceed any further ... so that i can massage the kinks out of our testimony .
do you really think we can put all this across ?
the truth is so self evident to me , mrs. donaly , that l" m sure l" il be able to make it equally as transparent to anyjury , should your husband decide to take it that far .
we' il need to caucus again to draw up a picture of your husband' s net worth .
a map of enemy territory , so to speak .
you said he' s a television producer ?
he has a soap opera ...
the sands of time .
it' s a silly show .
well , it' il be yours soon .
thank you very much .
thank you , mr. massey .
yeah .
bye bye .
still , you have to admire him for taking those pictures .
now , mrs. gutman , you testified that you were your husband" s sexual slave ... for 36 years during your marriage .
except for two years when he was in the navy in southeast asia .
and before your marriage , what was your profession ?
i was a hostess for braniff airlines .
and what is your husband' s profession ?
he manufactures staples and industrial brad tacks .
he" s very successful .
how would you describe your husband' s sexual proclivities ?
well , at first he was a very gentle and tender lover .
but then he became more and more fixated ... on toys and machinery and devices of various kinds .
i can' t help it .
you don' t decide to become bored .
it just happens .
you' re just looking for trouble .
it' s a midlife crisis .
look , get yourself a new car .
i have a new car .
i have two new cars and a tab at the mercedes dealership .
torn the house down twice , rebuilt the cabin in vail , got three of those , uh ... yard people ...
gardeners ?
gardeners .
i' ve got a man who waxes my jet .
these encounters were videotaped .
sometimes there would be a gizmo .
a gizmo ?
he had a device he called the intruder .
it was something he had the engineers at the factory design .
and then he had a prototype built out of the parts from our vacuum cleaner .
i see .
so the vacuum cleaner wasn" t available to me for several months .
several months without the appliance .
yes !
the problem is , everyone is willing to compromise .
that' s the problem with the institution of marriage .
it' s based on compromise .
even through its dissolution .
mrs. gutman here , she' s gonna score some points ... concerning her husband' s sexual politics .
naturally , we' il try to impeach .
and then the entire process will find an equilibrium point ... based on the skill of the individual lawyers .
then both parties will go home with their portion of the staple factory .
that' s life .
life is compromise .
that' s not life .
that' s death .
struggle and challenge and ultimate destruction of your opponent ... that" s life .
let me ask you something .
attila the hun .
thank you , mrs. gutman .
ivan the terrible .
henry the eighth .
mr. massey , any questions ?
what do they have in common ?
middle name .
no .
they didn' t just win .
they ...
they ...
mr. massey ?
they destroyed ...
mr. massey , again i ask , have you any questions for the complainant ?
i' m sorry , your honor .
i was just consulting with an associate .
now , mrs. gutman , do you know a man named david gonzalez ?
well , he' s the tennis pro at the club .
the tennis pro ?
then why are your letters addressed to him , " dear david and goliath " ?

lifecycle , lifestep , lifecircuit .
gus petch don' t pussyfoot around .
i must say , for someone in your line of work , you don' t exhibit a great deal of tact .
you want tact , call a tactician .
you want an ass nailed , you call gus petch .
christ , you seem to be taking it pretty good .
i seen " em come in here , weep and wail like baptists at a funeral .
like they hired me to prove their husbands weren" t foolin ' around .
don' t get me wrong , mr. , um ...
petch .
gus petch .
whilst i don" t find this terribly amusing , i am delighted that you found this material .
this is going to be my passport to wealth , independence and freedom .
sounds like to me you gon ' nail his ass .
honey ?
honey !
rex , get away from the door .
honey ?
my key doesn' t work .
can we talk about this ?
rex , get away from the door .
oh , look , i know that you' re upset , honey .
rex , for your own safety , get away from the door .
i don' t like having to set the dogs on you .
oh , for crying out loud , if we could ...
dogs ?
yes , dogs .
i wanted some security since l" il be living here alone .
look , marylin , can' t we have a civilized discussion about this ?
our lawyers can .
aaah !

discovery ?
gopnick ?
and a lance kelso called .
he read your article about palimony settlements ...
lance kelso .
in same sex partnerships ... and would like to schedule an appointment .
same sex .
arthur yardumian and his tax attorney want to reschedule their caucus for tomorrow .
yardumian ?
arthur had to fly to atlanta for a deadbeat dad hearing .
atlanta ?

rex rexroth .
rex rexroth ?
real estate .
he' s okay .
mr. rexroth .
uh , call me rex .
please .
miles massey .
please sit .
relax .
consider this office your office , your haven , your war room for the duration of the campaign .
thank you .
now , sir ... tell me your troubles .
well ... my wife has me between a rock and a hard place .
that' s her job .
you should respect that .
when i first met marylin , we were crazy about each other .
not emotionally , of course .
just , we couldn' t keep our hands off each other .
but then ...
time marches on .
ardor cools .
yeah .
so , um , we had an understanding .
whereby ?
we could see other people .
has mrs. rexroth pursued the opportunities implicit in your arrangement ?
uh , i can ...
i can only assume ...
not in court , you can' t .
has she retained counsel ?
i don' t know .
she has rottweilers .
not a good sign .
and have you yourself exploited your understood freedom ?
there' s a lady .
a ayoung lady .
she lets me be myself .
of course .
and your wife is aware and/ or has evidence ?
video .
hah !
to cut to the chase , forensically speaking , is there a prenup ?
the fault , dear brutus , lies not in our stars , but in ourselves .
let me ask you this ...
what kind of a settlement do you seek ?
what are , for you , the parameters of the possible ?
well , that' s the problem .
i can' t afford to give her anything .
nothing ?
yeah , i know that sounds a little rough , but listen ,
l" m about to close a deal to develop some mini malls .
i' m mortgaged up to my heinie .
if this deal goes south , i am ruined .
i will lose millions .
so you propose ... that , in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part , your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear ?
well , is that possible ?
it' s a challenge .
why don' t you come out to malibu and see my new beach house tomorrow .
i didn' t know dmitri had a beach house .

quite a paper trail .
he had it in the dog' s name .
oh .
well , tomorrow won" t work .

well , as my private investigator put it , we' re gonna nail his ass .
i' ve been trying to nail george' s ass for years , but he is so careful .
oh . !
oh . !
are you all right , claire ?
down the wrong pipe .
so , who' s your lawyer ?
freddy bender .
i have an appointment this afternoon with rex and his schnauzer .
so , who" s rex" s guy ?
miles massey .
miles massey ?
of massey , myerson ?
do you know him ?
by reputation .
and , marylin , he' s no schnauzer .
he got phyilis rumsey that cute little island of george' s .
george was so impressed , he hired him when he divorced his second .
muriel rumsey .
who' s she ?
now ?
night manager at mcdonald' s .
but , marylin , do we have a man for you .
thorstenson gieselensen .
he just separated from his third .
he' s in fish .
he is fish .
well , he' s tuna .
ladies , i' m not seeing anyone until i' ve finished nailing rex' s ass .
but , marylin , this man is tuna .
sarah , one husband at a time .
i' il do the talking .
i know you' il be tempted to chime in , but remember that you' re in an emotionally vulnerable state .
l" m the professional .
oh .
okay .
freddy .
freddy bender , this is rex rexroth .
and you are the lovely marylin .
please , ms. rexroth .
and you must be mr. massey .
please , miles .
sit .
sit down .
freddy , i was sorry to hear about the goldberger award .
pastry ?
we did very well .
we did very well .
not to worry , mrs. rexroth .
you' re ably represented .
i' m sure freddy' s just too modest to tell you he used to clerk for clarence thomas .
pastry ?
going begging .
don' t try to bait me , miles .
if you have a proposal to make , let' s hear it .
well , at this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation .
my client' s ruled that out .
my client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution to the marriage without prejudice .
that' s a fart in a stiff wind .
my client proposes a 30 day cooling off period .
my client feels sufficiently dispassionate .
my client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order .
what' s so goddamn funny ?
please , let me handle this .
all right , so much for the ice breakers .
what are you after , freddy ?
my client is prepared to settle for 50 percent of the marital assets .
why only 50 , freddy ?
why not a hundred ?
while we" re dreaming , why not 150 ?
are you familiar with kershner ?
kershner does not apply .
bring this to trial , we' il see if kershner applies .
what' s kershner ?
please , let me handle this .
kershner was in kentucky .
kershner was in kentucky ?
kershner was in kentucky .
all right , freddy , forget kershner .
what' s your bottom line ?
primary residence , 30 percent of remaining assets .
what , are you nuts ?
have you forgotten kershner ?
freddy , it" s a negotiation .
see you at the preliminary .
freddy , we" re all friends here .
it' s a negotiation .
hey , uh ...
freddy !
fine .
we' il eat the pastry .
i thought that went well .
don' t cry out loud [ men chuckling , muttering ] [ continues ]
oh , yeah .
gus , you outdid yourself .
mm hmm .

mm hmm , that" s cool .
very cool .
let" s go back to the football game . !
oh , kiss my ass , now .

bordeaux ?
chateau margaux ?
' 57 ?
' 59 .
' 54 .
mmm , mr. massey .
good , sir .
your husband had told me you were the most beautiful woman that he' d ever met .
i didn' t expect the most beautiful woman l" d ever met .
dismiss your vows , your feigned tears , your flattery , for where a heart is hard they make no battery .
whoever loved that loved not at first sight ?
now , you didn' t ask me here to pick me up .
you could be disbarred for that .
maybe i' m reckless .
what was your performance about this afternoon ?
what did your lawyer say ?
oh , freddy thinks you' re a buffoon .
he says you' ve been too successful , you' re bored , complacent , and you' re on your way down .
but you don' t think so .
how do you know ?
why would you be here ?
why did you ask me ?
can' t i be curious ?
about what ?
do you ever answer questions ?
do you ?
i' il have the tournedoes of beef .
the lady will have the same .
thank you .
thank you , sir .
i assume you' re a carnivore .
oh , mr. massey , you have no idea .
miles , please .
tell me more about yourself .
all right , miles .
let me tell you everything that you need to know .
you may think you' re tough , but i eat men like you for breakfast .
l" ve invested five good years in my marriage to rex , and i' ve nailed his ass fair and square .
now i' m going to have it stuffed , mounted ... and have my lady friends come over and throw darts at it .
man hater , huh ?
people don' t go on safaris ' cause they hate animals .
so it" s just for the hunt , with the trophy at the end .
no .
nothing so frivolous .
this divorce means money .
money means independence .
that' s what i' m after .
what are you after , miles ?
well , i' m a lot like you .
just looking for an ass to mount .
well , don' t look at mine .
yeah .
oy vey .
i got ya .
see this ?
lightjazz ]
yeah ?
uh , i' il just have a , um , salad , please .
um , baby field greens .
what did you call me ?
uh , no , l i ...
l i didn' t call you anything .
you want a salad ?
yeah .
do you ...
do you have a , uh , green salad ?
what the fuck color would it be ?
why are we eating here ?
what" s his problem ?
just bring him an iceberg lettuce and a mealy tomato wedge smothered with french dressing .
and for you ?
ham sandwich on stale rye bread .
lots of mayo , easy on the ham .
slaw cup ?
what the hell .
hello , marge .
how are you , gus ?
i' m all right .
okay , now , i minoxed her address book .
don' t call me anymore for this penny ante shit .
i shoot action .
me and the ikegami , jack .
thank you , gus .
and those rottweilers were a menace , man .
i told you she had dogs .
yeah .
you ain' t tell me they had a hard on for anus africanus .
gus , did you see any evidence , any telltale signs ... of indiscretion on the part of mrs. rexroth ?
what are you talkin ' ' bout , " telltale signs " ?
look , i see an ass , i nail it .
i don' t sneak around sniffin ' at sheets .
goddamn it , i' m gus petch !
couldn' t you be disbarred for that ?
no , i don' t think so .
maybe if i' d had the patty melt .
you had a guy break into her house and photograph her address book .
no , wrigley , i happened to let a man know ... that i was interested in her address book ... that' s not criminal .
i also happened to let him know that i was taking her out to dinner .
that' s not a crime either .
no , i don' t see myself as culpable in any sense .
you , on the other hand , could be disbarred ... for developing and examining these photos of her address book , but that doesn' t really concern me .
right .
who are you looking for ?
tenzing norgay .
tenzing norgay .
that' s someone she slept with .
i doubt it .
tenzing norgay was the sherpa that helped edmund hillary climb mt .
everest .
and marylin knows him .
no , you idiot .
not the tenzing norgay .
her tenzing norgay .
i' m not sure that i actually follow that .
few great accomplishments are achieved single handedly , wrigley .
most have their norgays .
marylin rexroth is even now climbing her everest .
i wanna find her norgay .
but how do you determine which of the people on here are ...
how do you spot a norgay ?
yeah .
you start with the people with the funny names .
oyez , oyez .
family court of the fifth district of los angeles county now in session .
the honorable marva munson presiding .
all rise .
have you sat before her before ?
no .
no , the judge sits first .
then we sit .
well , have you sat after her before ?
sat after her before ?
you mean , have we argued before her before ?
the judge sits in judgment .
the counsel argues before the judge .
so , have you argued before her before ?
before her before , or before she sat before ?
before her before .
i said , before her before .
no , you said before she sat before .
i did at first , but ...
look , don' t argue .
i' m not .
i' m ...
no , you don' t argue .
we argue .
counsel argues .
you appear .
thejudge sits .
then you sit .
or you stand in contempt .
and then we argue .
the counsel argues .

mrs. rexroth , do you know those lines ?
objection , your honor .
grounds ?
uh , poetry recitation .
let me rephrase .
mrs. rexroth ... how high is that wall around your heart ?
your honor , this is harassment , and , frankly , it' s still a little , uh , arty farty .
rephrase .
mrs. rexroth , have you ever been in love ?
yes .
of course .
with rex .
and you' ve always loved him ?
whoever loved that loved not at first sight ?

and what does that job entail ?
i satisfy such requests as the clientele may present .

and she was a guest of the red ...
trousers ?
oh , many times , for relaxing and making alpine recreation .
mm hmm .
i am curious about her visit of five years ago .
january 1998 .
can you remember any specific request she made at that time ?
yes , i can .
at what , at that time , did she tell you she required ?
she said that she required ... a husband !
do you want some bones ?
huh ?
does elsbieta want some bones ?
has anyone any bones ?
does anyone have any bones ?
b ...
uh , bones ?
dog candies ?
no , they are not candies .
milk bones .
hard , crunchy bones for the teeth .
uh , hard , uh ...
we" il attend to the dog later .
now , baron ...
where were we ?
she said that she required a husband .
oh , do you want some bones ?
does elsbieta want some bones ?
has anyone any bones ?
hard , crunchy bones for the ...
right .
now , a husband .
that' s an unusual request .
did she specify what kind of a husband she was looking for ?
stop him .
objection .
grounds ?
uh ... hearsay .
it' s not secondhand , your honor .
this is direct testimony about the baron' s own conversation .
i' m going to allow it .
yeah .
she said she wanted a very rich husband .
she wanted to know the businesses and the wealths s ... the wealths s s ...
can i say this ?
wealths of our various eligible guests .
and did she have any other specifications ?
objection , your honor .
inflammatory .
what' s good for the gander , your honor .
is this a legal argument ...
what' s good for the gander " ?
you got to play your tape , freddy .
mr. massey has a point there .
l" m going to allow it .
were there any other specifications ?
she " specificated " a silly man .
objection , your honor . !
l" m going to allow it .
she " specificated " a man who , though clever at making money , would be easily duped and controlled .
objection , your honor .
shut up , freddy .
she' s allowing it .
she " specificated" a man with a wandering pee pee .
how you say ?
aphilanderer whose affairs would be transparent to the world .
objection , your honor !
finally , a man whom she could herself brazenly cuckold ... until such time as she might choose to , uh ...
we would say , " faire un coup de marteau sur des fesses .
you would say , " make hammer on his fanny .
your honor , objection . !
l irrelevant . !
i' m going to allow it !
tell us , baron ...
did you introduce her to such a man ?
sir , i am the concierge !
and to whom did you introduce that calculating woman ?
i introduced her ... to that silly man .
your honor , objection . !
let the record show that the baron has identified rex rexroth as the silly man !
i did it . !
it was i. !
i introduced her to that silly man !
you son of a bitch !
the red faced angry one .
i introduced them !
absolument !
i did it . !
it was i. !
i just love trains !
i love trains !
if you please , sir !
you" re the one who" s sick . !
no ... [ groaning ]
if you please ...
not the larynx !
objection , your honor !
strangling the witness !
i' m going to allow it .
well , i think it stinks .
they left you with nothing .
makes you wonder about the entire legal system ,
like rodney what' s his name .
they bought massey' s argument .
if i lied or cheated and was with rex only for his money , then he shouldn' t have to give me any .
well , that makes no sense .
why else would you put in all those years ?
oooh !
are you all right , sarah ?
yeah .
wh what is it ?
peptic ulcer .
i have medication , but i can' t take it before elective surgery .
you shouldn' t be living here alone , sarah .
my goddamn husbands gave me the ulcer .
but a bottle of bromo can' t love you back .
yeah .
it' s a catch 22 .
i have to admit , i don' t like living alone .
i mean , do i need 46 rooms ?
you could see people .
it' s risky .
palimony .
son of a bitch marvin mitchelson .
i' m telling you , honey , getting laid is financial russian roulette .
maybe i shouldjust tear it all down , build a cottage .
more landscaping .
well , with my money , i can' t afford to be fooling around .
besides , i have you .
it' il be fun ... just the girls .
well , thanks , sarah , but i can" t sleep on your couch forever .
i' m going to marry again , nail the guy' s ass good .
and this time there' il be no puffy von espy .
knock knock .
excuse me .
mr. donaly ?
mr. donaly ?
mr. donaly , excuse me .
you are donovan donaly ?
i' m in a meeting .
mr. donaly .
i need a name .
and , of course , we will have to litigate .
sentence , paragraph .
naturally , the first concern for both parties ... is the welfare of little wendelljunior .
nevertheless , we do question whether the continuing expenses for his special ed classes ... are truly justified , given the great strides ...
mr. massey , the senior partner would like to see you .
herb wants to see me ?
if you have a moment .
fourteen summaryjudgments sought .
thirteen granted .
eighteen movements to void for respondent' s prejudice .
eighteen granted .
twelve court days on the rexroth case alone .
320 billable hours paralegal services .
680 billable ... at full attorney rate .
eighty five lunches charged .
counselor ... you are the engine ... that drives this firm .
mr. massey ?
please , no calls .
i' m feeling ... a little fragile .
i' m sorry , mr. massey , but i felt certain you' d want to know marylin rexroth wants to see you .
marylin ...
uh , uh , uh , w ...
uh , when did she , uh ...
she' s here now .
is she armed ?
give me a minute .
marylin .
how nice of you to ...
marylin ?
shame on you .
marylin .
what a lovely surprise .
marylin , what a pl ...
who the hell are you ?
hello , miles .
so nice of you to see us .
may i introduce howard d. doyle of doyle oil .
i' m goddamn pleased to meet you .
marylin here , she says you' re the best .
says you' re aces .
well , thank you , mr. , uh ...
uh , any ... any relation tojohn d. doyle of doyle oil ?
oh , you must be talkin ' about grandpa john .
my papa' s john d. too .
the deuce , we called him .
you know , kinda the rebel of the family .
but they knocked off that wholejohn d. routine when they christened yours truly .
grandpa nearly had a stroke .
he did have a stroke , but that was later , during the labor activity in ' 52 .
the government stepped in .
mm hmm .
uh ...
they called it mediation .
well ...
he called it incipient communism .
of course , that' s when he had his stroke .
golly , the whole left side of his body is as useless as tits on a boar hog .
he lingered in a vegetative state for years ...
well , that is fascinating , mr. doyle .
what say we have a seat ?
a seat ?
marylin' s had me runnin ' up and down rodeo drive all day long .
kinda hit and run shoppin ' , you know .
take no prisoners .
forced march kind of thing .
my god , my dogs are barkin ' .
we started out at this li' i ol ' place right off of wilshire ...
it' s been quite a day .
had pewter things .
but anyway , miles , i know you' re busy and you charge by the hour , so i' il get straight to the point .
howard d. and i are planning to marry .
well ...
well , i suppose that congratulations are in order .
well , thank you , miles .
you know , the urge to wedlock and form a lastin" monogamous bond sanctified by ritual , it" s pert near universal .
as a matter of fact , it might be of some interest to you , bein" in a related business ...
even your indigenous americans ...
uh , i believe it was your cree ... used to ...
howard and i are here because i' ve learned , through bitter experience , that when it comes to matrimony and law , you are the very best .
and as you are well aware , my previous marriage ... ended in an unjustified stain ... upon my reputation .
my motives were impugned .
i was slandered in court .
i was painted a harlot .
oh , honey , you ain' t no harlot .
oh , yes , honey .
so it" s my desire to remove any trace of suspicion ... from the mind of my dear howard doyle .
oh , honey , come on , now .
i wish to execute a prenuptial agreement .
and l" m dead set against it .
i mean , just anti the whole deal .
howard' s lawyers prefer it .
i insist upon it .
oh , damn lawyers .
uh , no offense to the present company or anything , you know .
now , is it my understanding that the massey prenup has never been penetrated ?
that is correct .
not to blow my own horn , but they devote an entire semester to it at harvard law .
they got a hell of a school up there , ain" t no doubt about it .
we donated that doyle building up there here a while back .
mm hmm .
now , i myself went to texas a& m.
i' m an aggie .
business ?
tight end .
and i had a fair amount of success against the split t defense .
see , when they line up symmetrical thataway , it allows me to buttonhook and , you know , do a down and in , up and out and different things ... post pattern every now and then .
your tight ends don' t generally run a post .
but if the qb calls it , hell , l" m ready .
interrupt for a second ?
yeah .
i wanna make sure that you both understand ... what it is you' re asking .
the massey prenup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage , for any reason , both parties will leave it with what they brought in ... and earned during .
no one can profit from the marriage .
the prenup protects the wealthier party .
without it , that party is exposed , a sitting duck .
not a hell of a lot of romance in that .
no , sir , there is not .
no romance .
more to the point , no wriggle room .
so , are we sure ... that this is what we want ?
absolutely .
it' s my gift to howard , for his peace of mind , whether or not he' s worried about it at this moment .
oh , honey pie , do i look worried ?
excuse me , mr. doyle .
could i just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment ?
well , okay .
you gon ' leave a deposit ?
what are you up to ?
something you won' t understand , miles .
howard and i are very much in love .
i don' t know what you' re thinking , but i have to warn you , the massey prenup has never been penetrated .
you sign the prenup , you can' t get his money .
thanks for the professional help .
marylin , think of me for a moment ... not as an attorney but as a friend .
does that mean you won' t be charging us for the hour ?
dump him .
you can' t nail his ass .
is that all ?
no , that' s not all .
i could have you disbarred for that .
it was worth it .
a romantic divorce attorney .
you fascinate me .
l" il get right on it .
l" il whip something up .
all right .
thank you .
how' s lionel ?
he" s fine .
he asked me to deliver the keynote address at this year' s convention in vegas .
that' s quite an honor .
i suppose .
on top of a great victory .
what was that ?
what was that " ?
um , rex rexroth ?
he kept everything ?
you win ?
no compromise ?
isn' t that what you wanted ?
oh , good god , miles .
what are you looking for ?
i don' t know .
okay , i won .
what then ?
how many cases has herb myerson won ?
the old man ?
more than anybody .
he' s a legend .
and look at him .
he' s 87 years old , he' s the first one into the office in the morning .
no home life .
who needs a home when you have a colostomy bag ?
she can' t really love this dope , can she ?
who ?
uh , who loves who ?
marylin rexroth .
she signed a prenup for an oil millionaire .
a ...
massey ... prenup ?
yeah .
well , then she is not after his money .
only love is in mind if the massey is signed . [ guitar ]
april  come she will  when streams are ripe and swelled with rain nay , she will stay a resting in my arms again [ stifled sobbing ]
what the hell' s wrong with you ? april  come she will
thank you for coming to this celebration ... of the love between our two friends , marylin and howard .
in today' s cynical world , it' s so hard to take that great leap of faith ... aboard the ship of love and caring .
but today marylin and howard are taking that leap ... and telling us , their friends , that they do believe , that they do have faith , that they do love .
do you , howard drexler doyle , take marylin to be your shipmate on this journey through life , through gale and doldrum , seas choppy , wild and calm ?
yes , i do , father scott .
and do you , marylin rexroth , take howard to be your shipmate and companion ... to ports of every clime ,
be it in first class or steerage ?
i do .
then , by the power vested in me by the state of california , and as captain of the good ship amore veritas ,
i now pronounce you man and wife .
what do you think ?
what are they , ladles ?
berry spoons .
spoons ?
berry spoons .
everybody has spoons .
and nobody needs berry spoons .
everybody eats berries .
who are you , pollyanna ?
hey , everybody !
folks !
hey , y' all !
where" d you see" em at ?
a martha stewart catalog right next to the silver napkin rings ?
i need your attention for a minute .
stadium seat ass warmers ?
dear god , wrigley , how many cockamamie personal possessions do we have to amass ...
why so angry ?
now , i know it' s not common practice for the groom to give his bride a gift on their weddin ' day , but ever since i met marylin there ...
i can' t seem to quit givin ' her things .
and i don' t wanna stop ' cause it feels so durn good !
chow sing , bring that barbecue sauce over here , little buddy .
there you go .
put that thing on my neck now .
now , honey , it' s like the padre said .
i want love and trust between us .
love and trust and not a thing else .
and this here deed that i' m fixin ' to perform ...
well , honey , let me just , uh ...
you see this ?
this is for you , darlin ' .
this here is for you .
this here is for you , baby .
ever" last little speck of it .
i love you .
i mean , i love you like a son of a bitch !
i trust you . !
this here is for you , baby .
brilliant !
baby , this is for you .
what is it ?
i really love you .
it' s the prenup .
i love her !
i trust her . !
ladies and gentlemen , it' s the prenup !
i trust her . !
brilliant !
you look beautiful .
ladies , if you' il excuse us .
we have to talk .
i would like to offer my congratulations .
it was a beautiful gesture of howard' s .
well , howard is a beautiful person .
a diamond in the rough .
and i have a feeling that someday soon ... you' il be taking that diamond and leaving the rough .
in a month or so , once i' ve established that i' ve tried to make the marriage work .
may i offer my services ?
oh , thanks .
but no .
no , i' m retaining freddy bender .
poor freddy .
he was awfully blue after my last divorce .
well , i admire your loyalty .
to lawyers , anyway .
i guess without the prenup it' s something even freddy could manage .
but how did you get howard to do it ?
it felt like it was his idea .
surely , mr. massey , you' ve addressed enough juries ... to appreciate the power of suggestion .
mmm . [ guitar ]
wish i was a kellogg" s corn flake [ continues ]
look , now that the marriage is winding down , have dinner with me .
no .
no , nothing doing until the ink is dry on the settlement .
oh , this' il be no settlement .
if i know marylin rexroth , this' il be nothing short of a complete and total ... annihilation .
you' re gonna win .
excuse me ?
i can always tell , going to vegas , who' s gonna win .
well , thanks , but i' m going on business .
i always win . yeah yeah
you know why i hate this town , wrigley ?
you see , people get to las vegas , and all of a sudden , the rules of the moral universe don' t apply .
when god is dead , all things are possible .
no fault divorce ... two week divorce without a lawyer .
made me sick to my stomach .
no fault divorce .
good god .
talk about your oxymoron .
what' s the world comin ' to ?
one man can only do so much .
one man ...
what are you talkin ' about ?
freddy .
i had lunch with freddy bender yesterday .
he tells me that marylin rexroth doyle is now richer than croesus .
ah , yes , but is she richer than mrs. croesus ?
she could buy and sell you 10 times over .
she ...
my god , is that her ?
mmm .
freddy said she was flying in with him .
celebrating , i guess .
i' m fascinated by that creature .
richer than me , huh ?
well , she deserves every penny .
and now she" s single again .
excuse me .
no .
you should stay away from her , miles .
recite your keynote address .
take a cold shower .
you' re looking well , marylin .
hello , miles .
obscene wealth becomes you .
i should' ve known you' d be here .
be here ?
i' m the keynote speaker .
oh , how nice for you .
nailing your spouse' s assets .
excuse me ?
my speech .
oh !
oh , i' m sure you' il bring the house down .
it' s an easy crowd .
at this point , i would think you' re probably the only person that i can' t teach anything to .
really ?
mmm .
now , correct me , but since by now the ink must be dry ,
i believe i have the right to collect .
on ?
you promised to have dinner with me once you were free .
i said i wouldn' t whilst i wasn' t , which implies no promise once i am .
noted .
let me rephrase .
i would be delighted ... honored , really ... if you' d ... [ gasps ]
howard !
ow !
howard !
howard !
you named him after your ex .
i' m sentimental .
well , i' m free this evening , so i suppose a little dinner would do no harm .
le veuve clicquot ponsardin , 1990 , sir .
yes .
thank you .
i' il take care of it .
marylin , this is a moment to savor .
yes , we were adversaries , but we were also professionals .
so let us raise a glass to friendship .
to victory .
so , how does it feel ?
sorry ?
victory .
independence .
oh , um ...
well , frankly , miles ...
it' s not everything you' d hoped for ?
i know the feeling .
independence .
two edged sword .
my friend ...
my best friend ...
sarah sorkin ?
sarah battista o' flanagan sorkin ?
the o' flanagan settlement ?
ahh .
hmm .
huh .
anyway , three fine settlements .
more money than she could ever hope to spend .
yes .
her vaunted independence .
don' t tell me .
she sits around the house , afraid to see people , afraid to put her portfolio into play .
and only a peptic ulcer to keep her warm at night .
yes .
there' s a certain point when you' ve achieved your goals .
you realize that you' re still not satisfied .
yes .
we should order .
you know , i' m not really hungry .
neither am i.
shh .

mr. mackinnon here will be officiating .
sorry .
short notice .
pen .
marylin , you' re welcome to examine this .
this is the massey prenup .
as you know , it' s ironclad .
we tried to reach freddy bender .
we tried to reach freddy , to have him here for your protection , but we couldn' t find him .
i couldn' t get him .
are you two here to get married or to bullshit ?
so you can' t hope to benefit from the marriage ?
not in any way .
and my wealth is completely ... completely protected ?
as if a lead veil had been drawn across it .
do you still want to marry me ?
more than ever .
wedding march " ]
do you , miles longfellow massey , of massey , myerson , sloan and gurolnick , l. l. p. , take marylin hamilton rexroth doyle to be your lawful wedded wife ?
i do .
yes .

bridge over troubled water " ]
l" il take care of you later .
no , no , no , no , no .
no .
this is all wrong .
wha ...
is it the kilt ?
do you love me ?
more than anything .
can i trust you ?
yes .
you can trust me .
darling , you' re exposed .
a sitting duck .
i hereby declare the 12th congress of the national organization ...
of matrimonial attorneys nationwide ... open .
as our first order of business , it is a privilege to call to the podium our keynote speaker .
from the los angeles firm of massey , myerson , sloan and gurolnick , a man whose name is synonymous with bitter disputes and big awards ,
miles massey .
thank you , branco .
in the world of ...
in the world of matrimonial law , there are ...
in the world of matrimonial law , there are multiple tactics ... [ chuckles ]
friends , this morning i stand before you a very different miles massey ... than the one that addressed you last year ... on the disposition of marital assets following murder/ suicide .
i wish to talk to you today not about technical matters oflaw .
i wish to talk to you about something more important .
i wish to talk to you from the heart ...
because today ... for the first time in my life ,
i stand before you ... naked ...
vulnerable ...
and in love .
love .
it' s a word we matrimonial lawyers avoid .
funny , isn" t it ?
we" re frightened of this emotion , which is , in a sense , the seed of our livelihood .
well , today miles massey is here to tell you ... that love need cause us no fear .
love need cause us no shame .
love is ... good .
love is good .
i am , of course , aware that these remarks will be received here with cynicism .
cynicism , that cloak that advertises our indifference ... and hides all human feeling .
well , l" m here to tell you that that cynicism which we think protects us ... in fact destroys .
destroys love , destroys our clients , and , ultimately , destroys ourselves .
colleagues , when our clients come to us confused and angry and hurting ... because their flame of love is guttering and threatens to die , do we seek to extinguish that flame so that we can sift ... through the smoldering wreckage for our paltry reward , or do we fan this precious flame , this most precious flame , back into loving , roaring life ?
do we counsel fear or trust ?
do we seek to destroy or build ?
do we meet our clients" problems with cynicism ... or with love ?
the choice is , of course , each of ours .
for my part , i' ve made the leap of love , and there' s no going back .
ladies and gentlemen , this is the last time i will address you ... as the president of n. o. m. a. n ... or as a member .
i intend to devote myself to pro bono work in east los angeles ... or ... one of those other ...
god bless you all .
i love you , man .
so , wrigley , i' m gonna be relinquishing my partnership in massey , myerson .
if you' d care to join me in my new endeavor , i' d be delighted .
of course , i can' t offer you the same kind of financial remuneration you' ve grown accustomed to , but the work' il have to serve as its own reward .
barkeep , we' il have two of your finest scotches .
that' s the , uh ...
i propose a toast .
barkeep . !
that" s ...
that" s the soap that used to belong to , uh ...
now , you' il be serving in a junior capacity , of course .
donovan donaly .
miles , that" s , uh ... that" s , uh ... uh ...
it' il be a small operation , a boutique .
let me tell you what they called me in medical school .
the ...
i don' t see why my leadership skills should ...
howard ?
mackenzie the mechanical marvel .
it" s howard .
you see , i have no nerves .
he' s not an oil tycoon .
an actor .
doctor , this is highly unusual .
so marylin married a soap actor .
so she" s ... she" s ... poor .
get yourself some clean scrubs and have them prepare the o. r.
well , thank god you have the prenup .
i have no prenup .
you have no prenup .
i have no prenup .
you have no prenup .
thanks .
okay .
marylin ?
oh , hello , miles .
going back to l. a. ?
yes .
look , miles , i think it' s only fair to warn you that after a decent interval ,
i intend to have freddy seek an injunction ... that would forbid you to approach within 500 feet of my house .
you mean , my house .
oh , i believe the residence will be part of the settlement .
marylin , didn' t last night mean anything to you ?
oh .
well , about as much as it" il mean to you ... half of your net worth .
oh , miles , you' il always be my favorite husband .
but no more sentiment , darling .
i really have to be going .
the dog' s rented .
you didn' t win .
excuse me ?
i can always tell , comin ' back from vegas , who didn' t win .
you' re right .
but ... you' re going through with it ? [ edith piaf .
non , je ne regrette rien " ]
yes .
i just felt so sorry for him for a minute there .
at the preliminary hearing , he just looked so beaten .
well , he was beaten , fair and square .
i know , but ...
oh , their pathetic look .
it' s what they all fall back on when they don' t have a prenup .
just stay strong until the divorce is final .
relax ... and enjoy your pool .
do you think he' s eating enough ?
marylin !
this woman has humbled , [ wheezes ]
shamed and disgraced the entire firm .
yes , herb .
counselor ... this firm deals in power .
this firm deals in perception .
this firm cannot prosper ... nor long endure if it is perceived to be ... dancing to the music of a hurdy gurdy !
it' s just ...
herb , for the first time in my career ,
i don' t know what to do .
i' m a patsy .
i' m a sittin ' duck .
i' m lost .
lost ?
i' il tell you what you can do .
you can act like a man .
and let me tell you something , smart guy .
you thought you had it all figured out .
trust .
marriage .
all your goddamn love , love , love !
now , you listen to me .
l" m gonna talk to you about the goddamn law .
we serve the law !
we honor the law !
and sometimes , counselor , we obey the law .
but , counselor , [ gasps ]
this is not one of those times .
are you ...
wheezyjoe ?
which of youse is smith ?
well , uh , we' re here representing mr. smith ... on a matter of some delicacy .
who' s the pigeon ?

mr. smith would like you to neutralize ... terminate ... render unto a state of ... so that she isn' t so much , uh ... uh ...

that is mr. smith' s address ...
massey' s ...
smith ...
it' s mr. smith' s address , although mr. smith is not directly involved .
because of an impending legal matter , we need this to happen within a certain time frame .
on an expedited basis .
you' re in a rush .
we' re not in a rush .
mr. smith is .
sh ...
sh ...
sh ...
she won' t ...
she won' t suffer , will she ?
not unless you pay extra .
oh , l" ve been workin " on the railroad

hello ?
marylin , you must leave the house immediately .
it' s imperative that you leave the house .
hello , miles .
hello , dear .
now , miles , pending final settlement , you know that i' m entitled to use the house .
no , no , no !
you don' t understand !
it' s an emergency !
an emergency !
what is it ?
i forgot that i left the gas main on , which leaks !
good gosh .
that sounds dangerous .
it' s a deadly , odorless , colorless ,
liquid less " gas that ... that attacks the central nervous system ... and causes diarrhea and facial tics !
okay .
all right .
well , thanks for calling , miles .
okay .
bye bye .
i think she bought it .
so , tell me ... who sent you ?
mr. smith .

that' s his lawyer .
whatever they' re paying you , i' il double .

rottweilers .

golden parachute .

we feel that ...
wait , wait , wait , wait .
wheezy . !
uh ...
told him it was a no go .
gentlemen .
freddy .
hello , marylin .
hello , miles .
this is where we first met , remember ?
of course i remember .
it' s hard to believe that when you walk out that door today , you' il be walking out of my life forever .
it' s not something i wanted either .
but , then , i guess ... something inside of me died ... when i realized that you' d hired a goon to kill me .
wait a minute .
you hired him to kill me .
no .
both of you wait a minute .
nobody hired anyone to kill anyone .
hear , hear .
apparently , from what i can gather , a burglar broke into your house .
miles" s house .
whatever !
a burglar broke in intending to loot the place , uh , repented , became despondent over his lifestyle and shot himself .
so where does that leave you and me ?
well , we' ve outlined a settlement .
we think it" s very generous .
my client is prepared to consider a reconciliation .
but how could i trust you , miles , after all this ?
see , that" s exactly right .
the point is ...
you wounded me first , marylin .
i' m not proud of what i' ve done , but god knows , i did trust you once .
if you couldjust ... just give us another chance .
well , if you' il pardon me here , but i think my client is well beyond the point of considering ...
how could i ever trust you again ?
i mean , really trust you , miles ?
marylin , there is nothing in the massey prenup that says ... it can' t be executed after the parties wed .
well , if this , uh , indeed is a massey prenup , and a cursory examination tends to support that it is , then ...
oh , my god , marylin .
you' re exposed .
marylin .
counselor !
freddy !
freddy . !
come on , freddy . !
no fair . !
freddy . !
did you hear something ?
only the patter of little lawyers ' feet .
where did you find howard ?
the actor ?
from a tv producer .
i think you know him .
i gave him an idea for a new show , so he made me a partner .
i guess that means i' m a partner .
i guess it does .
and what exactly is it we' re partners in ?
who gets what and who gets who ?
you' il find out on america" s funniest divorce videos .
here" s the star of our show , gus petch . !
you goddamn right , folks .
i' m gus petch .
and we got a great show for ya .
