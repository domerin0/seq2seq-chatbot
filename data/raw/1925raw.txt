am i wrong ?
no , you ain' t wrong .
you know , in my own place ... my name ain' t ratso .
i mean it just so happens that in my own place ... my name is enrico salvatore rizzo .
i can' t say all that .
rico , then .
at least call me rico in my own goddamn place .
okay , rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
that enough for you ?
that' s fine .
give me a pillow .
come on , give me one of those pillows .
keep your meat hooks off my radio .
rico .
rico .
are you here again ?
didn' t i tell you once before to keep away from here ?
every time you take stuff from me !
get out of here !
that ain' t nice , pickin ' on a cripple !
cripple or not , i don' t care !
who the hell do you think you are ?
godamn it !
the two basic items necessary to sustain life ... are sunshine and coconut milk .
did you know that ?
that' s a fact .
in florida , you got a terrific amount of coconut trees there .
in fact , i think they even got ' em in the gas stations over there .
and ladies .
you know that in miami you got
are you listenin ' to me ?
you got more ladies in miami ... than in any resort area in the country there .
i think per capita , on a given day , there' s probably ... three hundred of ' em on the beach .
in fact , you can' t even scratch yourself ... without getting a belly button up the old kazoo there .
it' s hot .
let' s go .
come on !
smells worse hot than it did cold .
all right , startin ' tomorrow you cook your own goddamn dinner ... or you get one of your rich park avenue ladies to cook for you .
look , i' m eatin ' it , see ?
in her penthouse .
look , i' m eatin ' this shit , ratso .
mmm , good !
it' s good .
i gotta get outta here .
i gotta get outta here .
miami beach , that' s where you could score .
anybody can score there , even you .
in new york , no rich lady with any class at all buys that cowboy crap anymore .
they' re laughin ' at you on the street .
ain' t nobody laughin ' at me .
i seen ' em laughin ' at you , fella .
oh , what the hell do you know about women , anyway ?
when' s the last time you scored , boy ?
that' s the matter i only talk about that at confession .
we' re not talkin ' about me now .
well , when' d you' ve been to confession ?
that' s between me and my confessor .
and i' il tell you another thing .
frankly , you' re beginning to smell .
and for a stud in new york , that' s a handicap .
don' t talk to me about clean .
i' ve never seen you change your underwear once the whole time i' ve been here in new york .
that' s pretty peculiar behavior .
i don' t have to do that kind of thing in public .
i ain' t got no need to expose myself .
no , i' il bet you don' t !
i bet you ain' t never even been laid !
how about that ?
and you' re gonna tell me what appeals to women .
i know enough to know that that great big dumb cowboy crap of yours ... don' t appeal to nobody except every jacky on 42nd street !
that' s faggot stuff !
if you wanna call it by its name , that' s strictly for fags !
john wayne !
are you gonna tell me he' s a fag ?
i like the way i look .
it makes me feel good .
it does .
and women like me , goddammit !
hell , the only one thing i ever been good for is lovin ' .
women go crazy for me .
that' s a really true fact .
crazy annie , they had to send her away .
then how come you ain' t scored once the whole time you' ve been in new york ?
' cause i need management , goddammit !
' cause you stole $20 off of me !
that' s why you' re gonna stop crappin ' around about florida ... and get your skinny butt movin ' , earn $20 worth of management ... which you owe me !
signora , a woman in your condition shouldn' t have to do all this .
boy , you have a lot of laundry here .
well , it just ain' t right cheatin ' from a pregnant lady .
what did it cost her ?
what do you mean ?
get outta here .
the laundry syndicate lost a couple of coins .
i' m cryin ' .
that' s it , sir .
all right .
sir , where' s mine ?
the black homburg .
i brought it in at the same time .
well , i tell you , i don' t know .
you no have a hat here , mister .
you gotta bring me the ticket
what about that black homburg right up there ?
up in there .
is that it right there ?
a ticket ?
here' s my ticket .
it' s right there on the corner .
you wanna get it , right over there ?
i' il look ' em over .
keep goin ' .
up to the top .
right in the corner there .
the top one .
no , it not belong to yours .
it belong somebody else .
hey , you' re pretty damn good at that .
i bet you could make a livin ' at it if you try .
and end up a hunchback like my old man ?
if you think i' m crippled , you should' ve caught him at the end of the day .
my old man spent 14 hours a day down in that subway .
he' d come home , two , three dollars ' worth of change ... stained with shoe polish .
stupid bastard coughed his lungs out from breathin ' in that wax all day .
even the faggot undertaker couldn' t get his nails clean .
they had to bury him with gloves on .
okay , go ahead .
come on .
take a look .
don' t rush me , boy .
gotta take your time here .
get myself primed up , like i was turnin ' on the charm ... for some pretty little blonde lady , you know ?
then when i' m feelin ' cool and good ...
i spin around !
and there you are , you handsome devil you .
not bad .
not bad .
for a cowboy .
you' re okay .
you' re okay .
the lady will meet you in the lobby .
taxi !
yes , sir .
oh , i think you got somethin ' on your shoulder there .
there , you got it .
go ahead .
go ahead .

my grandma , sally buck ... she died without lettin ' me know .
oh , hitler' s storm troopers !
oh , hitler' s storm troopers !
just because i happened to get out of a car !
would you believe that ?
it all depends on what you believe in .
you know , like sometimes your spirit goes up , sometimes it goes
it goes other places .
how long did i hold up traffic just to get out ?
i ask you .
give some people a little power , and they gotta supersede their authority .
this whole kind of thing is spiritual spiritual matters .
oh , now you' re talkin ' priest talk .
you' re talkin ' priest talk now .
i ain' t talkin ' priest talk , i' m talkin ' about what people believe in .
some people believe you can come back in another body .
well , i hope i don' t come back in your body .
i ain' t asking you to come back in my body , but you can come back as anything .
you could come back as a a dog or a president .
if i had my choice , i' d come back as a president .
i ain' t that dumb .
what do you think ?
maybe you gotta think about those things for a while .
i' m usually not like this .
i' m usually a very calm and collected person .
really , forgive me .
i' m awfully sorry .
i think i' m gonna write a letter to the mayor .
