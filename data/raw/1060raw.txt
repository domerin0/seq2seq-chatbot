nice little spot , you might say .
number 17' s just down a bit .
now , this imposing edifice what first greets the eye ... is the home of admiral boom ...
late of his majesty' s navy .
likes his house shipshape , he does ... shipshape and bristol fashion at all times .
time gun ready ?
ready and charged , sir .
three minutes and six seconds .
aye , aye , sir .
what he' s famous for is punctuality .
the whole world takes its time from greenwich .
but greenwich , they say , takes its time from admiral boom .

good afternoon to you , young man .
where are you bound ?

number 17 cherry tree lane .
residence of george banks , esquire .
hello , hello , hello .
the admiral' s right .
heavy weather brewin ' at number 17 , and no mistake .
leave her alone !
shut up !
i' il show you .
don' t you be trying to stop the wretched creature !
let her go , that' s what i say , and good riddance !
i never liked her from the moment she set foot in the door .
but who gets stuck with the children with no nanny in the house ?
me , that' s who !
her and her high and mighty ways !
and that face of her that would stop a coal barge , it would .
indeed , mrs brill !
i wouldn' t stay in this house another minute ... not if you heap me with all the jewels in christendom .
no , no , katie nanna , don' t go !
stand away from that door , my girl !
but what am i gonna tell the master about the children ?
it' s no concern of mine .
those little beasts have run away from me for the last time .
they must be somewhere .
did you look around the zoo in the park ?
you know how jane and michael is .
coo !
you don' t think the lion could' ve got at them , do ya ?
you know how fond they was of hangin ' around the cage .
i said my say , and that' s all i' il say .
i' ve done with this house forever .
well , hip , hip , hooray !
and don' t stumble on the way out , dearie .
now , now , katie nanna !
mrs banks !
she' s home !
our daughter' s daughters will adore us and we' il sing in grateful chorus
well done , sister suffragette
good evening , katie nanna , ellen .
we had the most glorious meeting !
mrs whitbourne allen chained herself to the wheel of the prime minister' s carriage .
you should' ve been there .
mrs banks , i would like a word with you .
and mrs ainslie , she was carried off to prison ... singing and scattering pamphlets all the way !
i' m glad you' re home , madam .
i' ve always given the best that' s in me ...
oh , thank you , katie nanna .
i always knew you were one of us .
we' re clearly soldiers in petticoats
and dauntless crusaders for women' s votes
though we adore men individually
we agree that as a group they' re rather stupid
mrs banks .
cast off the shackles of yesterday
shoulder to shoulder into the fray
our daughter' s daughters will adore us
and they' il sing in grateful chorus
well done sister suffragette
being that as it may , i do not wish to offend , but i ...
from kensington to billingsgate one hears the restless cries
from every corner of the land womankind arise
political equality and equal rights with men
take heart for mrs pankhurst has been clapped in irons again
no more the meek and mild subservients we
we' re fighting for our rights militantly
never you fear
if i may have a word , mrs banks .
so cast off the shackles of yesterday mrs banks !
and shoulder to shoulder into the fray
our daughter' s daughters will adore us
and they' il sing in grateful chorus
" well done " mrs banks .
" well done " mrs banks .
" well done , sister suf ...
mrs banks !
what is it , katie nanna ?
mrs banks , i have something to say to you .
where are the children ?
the children , madam ... to be precise , are not here .
they' ve disappeared again .
katie nanna , this is really too careless of you .
doesn' t it make the third time this week ?
the fourth , madam .
and i for one have had my fill of it .
i' m not one to speak ill of the children , but ...
oh , please , when do you expect them home ?
i really couldn' t say .
and now if you' d be good enough to compute my wages , i' il ...
oh , gracious , katie nanna !
you' re not leaving ?
what will mr banks say ?
he' s going to be cross enough as it is to come home and find the children missing .
ellen , put these things away .
you know how the cause infuriates mr banks .
yes , ma' am .
katie nanna , i beseech you .
please reconsider .
think of the children .
think of mr banks .
he was just beginning to get used to you .
posts , everyone !
four , three , two , one .
fire !
katie nanna , i do beseech you ...
my wages , if you please .
bit early tonight , aren' t you , admiral ?
nonsense .
bang on the dot , as usual .
how are things in the world of finance ?
never better .
money' s sound .
credit rates are moving up , up , up .
and the british pound is the admiration of the world .
good man .
how do things look from where you stand ?
bit chancy , i' d say .
the wind' s coming up and the glass is falling .
don' t like the look of it .
good , good , good .
banks , shouldn' t wonder if you weren' t steering into a nasty piece of weather .
banks !
do you hear me ?
hello , katie nanna .
that must be heavy .
allow me .
hmph !
what a very pretty hat .
i feel a surge of deep satisfaction
much as a king astride his noble steed thank you .
when i return from daily strife to hearth and wife
how pleasant is the life i lead
dear , it' s about the children .
yes , yes , yes .
i run my home precisely on schedule
at 6 : 01 i march through my door
my slippers , sherry and pipe are due at 6 : 02
consistent is the life i lead
george , they' re missing .
splendid .
splendid .
it' s grand to be an englishman in 1910
king edward' s on the throne it' s the age of men
i' m the lord of my castle the sovereign , the liege
i treat my subjects , servants children , wife
with a firm but gentle hand noblesse oblige
it' s 6 : 03 and the heirs to my dominion
are scrubbed and tubbed and adequately fed
and so i' il pat them on the head and send them off to bed
ah , lordly is the life i lead
winifred , where are the children ?
they' re not here , dear .
what ?
well , of course they' re here !
where else would they be ?
i don' t know , george .
you don' t know ?
well , they' re missing .
katie nanna has looked everywhere .
very well .
i' il deal with this at once .
give me the police station , quickly , please .
i don' t think we need bother the police , dear .
the facts of the matter ...
kindly do not attempt to cloud the issue with facts .
one fact , and one fact alone is crystal clear !
katie nanna' s faltered at her post .
she' s let the family down .
and i shall bring her to bo ...
oh .
she' s left us , hasn' t she ?
yes , dear , only just .
what , uh ...
yes .
george banks here .
yes .
17 cherry tree lane .
it' s a matter of some urgency .
i should like you to send a policeman around immediately .
the policeman' s here , george !
what ?
oh , how very prompt .
what wonderful service .
thank you so much .
good night .
come in , constable .
come in .
thank you , sir .
while going about my duties on the other side of the park ...
i noted some valuables that had gone astray .
i believe they' re yours , sir .
valuables ?
come along , now .
come along .
jane !
michael !
winifred , please don' t be emotional .
oh , i wouldn' t be too hard on ' em , sir .
they' ve had a long , weary walk today .
children , come here at once .
well ?
i' m sorry we lost katie nanna , father .
you see , it was windy .
and the kite was too strong for us .
in a manner of speaking , sir , it was the kite that ran away , not the children .
thank you , constable .
i think i can manage this .
actually it wasn' t a very good kite .
we made it ourselves .
perhaps if you helped us to make one ...
ah , that' s the ticket , sir .
kites are skittish things .
why , only last week with me own youngsters ...
i' m very grateful to you , constable , for returning the children .
and i' m sure that if you go to the kitchen , cook' il find you a plate of something .
thank you , sir .
i shall now return to my duties .
thank you , constable .
good night , miss .
good night , ma' am .
good night , sir .
cook' il find me something .
i never ...
i' m awfully sorry about this , george .
i' il expect you' il want to discuss it .
i would indeed !
ellen , take jane and michael upstairs straightaway .
yes , sir .
i knew it .
when all' s said and done , who bears the brunt of everything around here ?
me , that' s who !
they don' t want an honest , hard workin ' girl around here .
they need a ruddy zookeeper .
i' m sorry , dear , but when i chose katie nanna ...
i thought she would be firm with the children .
she looked so solemn and cross .
winifred , never confuse efficiency with a liver complaint .
i' il try to do better next time .
next time ?
my dear , you' ve engaged six nannies in the last four months !
and they' ve all been unqualified disasters .
i quite agree .
choosing a nanny for the children is an important and delicate task .
it requires insight , balanced judgment , and an ability to read character .
under the circumstances , i think it might be apropos to take it upon myself to , uh ... select the next person .
oh , would you , george ?
obviously the way to find a proper nanny ... is to go about it in a proper fashion .
i shall put an advertisement in the times .
take this down please .
yes , of course , dear .
wanted .
uh , no .
uh , required .
firm , respectable , no nonsense .
a british nanny must be a general
the future empire lies within her hands
and so the person that we need to mould the breed
is a nanny who can give commands
you getting this , winifred ?
oh , yes , dear .
every word .
a british bank is run with precision
a british home requires nothing less
tradition , discipline and rules must be the tools
without them , disorder catastrophe , anarchy
in short you have a ghastly mess
splendid , george !
inspirational .
the times will be so pleased .
father ?
yes ?
we' ve discussed everything ... and we' re very sorry about what we did today .
i should certainly think so .
it was wrong to run away from katie nanna .
it was indeed .
and we do so want to get on with the new nanny .
very sensible .
i shall be glad to have your help in the matter .
we thought you would .
that' s why we wrote this advertisement .
advertisement for what ?
for the new nanny .
you wrote an advert ...
george , i think we should listen .
you said you wanted our help .
but , i ...
oh , very well .
a nanny for two adorable children .
adorable . " well , that' s debatable , i must say .
if you want this choice position
have a cheery disposition
jane , i don' t ...
rosy cheeks , no warts
that' s the part i put in .
play games , all sorts
you must be kind you must be witty
very sweet and fairly pretty
well , of all the ridic ...
george , please !
take us on outings give us treats
sing songs bring sweets
never be cross or cruel
never give us castor oil or gruel
love us as a son and daughter
and never smell of barley water
i put that in too .
if you won' t scold and dominate us
we will never you give you cause to hate us
we won' t hide your spectacles so you can' t see
put toads in your bed or pepper in your tea
hurry , nanny
many thanks sincerely
jane and michael banks
thank you .
most interesting .
and now i think we' ve had quite enough of this nonsense .
please return to the nursery .
they were only trying to help .
they' re just children .
i' m well aware they' re just children , winifred .
i only congratulate myself that i decided to step in and take a hand .
play games , sing songs , give treats .
ridiculous .
there' s no question in my mind whatsoever .
now is the time for action .
give me the times , please .
no , i do not know the number .
oh , george , you' re always so forceful .
the times ?
george banks here .
17 cherry tree lane .
i wish to place an advertisement in your column .
time gun ready ?
ready and charged , sir .
i' il take the report , mr binnacle .
the wind has changed , sir .
seems to be comin ' in from a new quarter .
so it is .
sir ?
what is it ?
bit of somethin ' or other taking place off the port bow .
ghastly looking crew , i must say !
coo !
there' s a fair queue of nannies outside , sir .
shall i show ' em in ?
ellen , i said 8 : 00 , and 8 : 00 it shall jolly well be .
you see ?
twelve seconds to go .
ten , nine , eight ...
posts !
seven , six , five , four ... three , two , one !
ellen , it is now 8 : 00 .
yes , sir .
but i have told you time and time again , ellen ...
i dislike being hurried into things .
i don' t understand .
they' re not what we advertised for at all .
michael , look !
perhaps it' s a witch .
of course not .
witches have brooms .
it' s her .
it' s the person .
she' s answered our advertisement .
rosy cheeks and everything .
ellen , you may now show them in , one at a time .
yes , sir .
you may come in one at a time .
thank you .
oh .
you are the father of jane and michael banks , are you not ?
i said , you are the father of jane and michael banks .
well , well ye ...
yes , of course , i mean .
uh ...
you brought your references , i presume .
may i see them ?
oh , i make it a point never to give references .
a very old fashioned idea to my mind .
is that so ?
we' il have to see about that then , won' t we ?
now then , the qualifications .
a cheery disposition .
i am never cross .
rosy cheeks .
obviously .
play games , all sorts .
well , i' m sure the children will find my games extremely diverting .
may i ?
eh , this paper ?
where did you get it from ?
i thought i tore it up .
excuse me .
you must be kind .
i am kind , but extremely firm .
have you lost something ?
ah !
yeah .
that paper , you see .
i thought that i ...
you are george banks , are you not ?
what ?
and you did advertise for a nanny , did you not ?
george banks .
very well then .
i tore it up , turned it over .
tore it up again and threw it in there .
yes .
i beg your pardon .
are you ill ?
i hope not .
now , about my wages .
the reference here is very obscure .
very obscure .
we must be very clear on that point , mustn' t we ?
yes , we must indeed .
i shall require every second tuesday off .
every tuesday .
on second thoughts , i believe a trial period would be wise .
hmm .
i' il give you one week .
i' il know by then .
i' il see the children now .
thank you .
close your mouth please , michael .
we are not a codfish .
well , don' t stand there staring .
best foot forward .
spit spot !
george ?
aah !
george , what on earth are you doing ?
i thought you were interviewing nannies .
i was !
i was !
you mean you' ve selected one already ?
yes , it' s done .
it' s , it' s all done .
well , where is she ?
what ?
well , eh , she' s in the nursery of course , i mean .
i put her to work straightaway , i mean .
how clever of you !
i would have muddled the whole thing .
tell me , is she everything that we' d hoped she be ?
well , i it all happened rather quickly .
i mean , i ...
i , uh ...
will she be firm ?
will she give commands ?
will she mould our young breed ?
you know , winifred , i think she will .
i think she will .
in that case ... perhaps you' d better tell ellen to dismiss the others .
the others ?
oh , yes .
ellen ?
y yes , sir ?
tell the other applicants they may go .
the position has been filled .
the others , sir ?
yes , the others .
how many nannies does she think we need in this house ?
the position has been filled .
i' m afraid the nursery isn' t very tidy .
it is rather like a bear pit , isn' t it ?
that' s a funny sort of bag .
carpet .
you mean to carry carpets in ?
no .
made of .
this is your room , and there' s a lovely view of the park .
hmm .
well , it' s not exactly buckingham palace .
still , it' s clean .
yes , i think it will be quite suitable .
just needs a touch here and there .
well , first things first .
i always say , the place to hang a hat is on a hat stand .
ah !
this will never do !
i much prefer seeing all of my face at the same time .
there ...
but there was nothing in it .
never judge things by their appearance .
even carpetbags .
i' m sure i never do .
a thing of beauty is a joy forever .
mmm , a little more light , perhaps .
we better keep an eye on this one .
she' s tricky .
she' s wonderful .
much better !
now , let me see .
that' s funny .
i always carry it with me .
it must be here somewhere .
what ?
my tape measure .
what do you want it for ?
i want to see how you two measure up .
well , that' s the funniest thing i ever saw .
i know it' s down here somewhere .
ah , ha ha , ha ha !
here it is .
good .
come along , then .
quickly .
head up , michael .
don' t slouch .
just as i thought .
extremely stubborn and suspicious .
i am not !
see for yourself .
extremely stubborn and sus ...
suspicious .
now you , jane .
mmm .
rather inclined to giggle .
doesn' t put things away .
how ' bout you ?
very well .
hold this for me .
as i expected .
mary poppins .
practically perfect in every way .
mary poppins !
is that your name ?
it' s lovely .
thank you .
i' ve always liked it .
now , shall we get on with it ?
get on with what ?
in your advertisement , did you not specifically request to play games ?
oh , yes !
very well , then .
our first game is called " well begun is half done " .
i don' t like the sound of that .
otherwise entitled , " let' s tidy up the nursery " .
i told you she was tricky .
shall we begin ?
it is a game , isn' t it , mary poppins ?
well , it depends on your point of view .
you see , in every job that must be done ... there is an element of fun .
you find the fun , and snap !
the job' s a game .
and every task you undertake becomes a piece of cake
a lark , a spree
it' s very clear to see
that a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down
the medicine go down medicine go down
just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
in a most delightful way
a robin feathering his nest has very little time to rest
while gathering his bits of twine and twig
though quite intent in his pursuit he has a merry tune to toot
he knows a song will move the job along
for a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
the medicine go down medicine go down
just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
in a most delightful way
the honeybees that fetch the nectar from the flowers to the comb
never tire of ever buzzing to and fro
because they take a little nip from every flower that they sip
and hence and hence
they find they find
their task is not a grind
cheeky .
don' t be all day about it , please .
let me out !
let me out !
let me out !
well , that was very ...
thank you now ...
when you' ve quite finished !
thank you .
that will be quite sufficient .
hats and coats , please .
it' s time for our outing in the park .
i don' t want an outing .
i want to tidy up the nursery again .
enough is as good as a feast .
come along , please .
let me look at you .
well , you' re not as well turned out as i' d like .
still , there' s time .
there' s time .
spit spot !
and off we go .
for a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
the medicine go down medicine go down
just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
in the most delightful way

and quick as you can say " bob' s your uncle " ... the most unusual things begin to happen .
i' m sure i haven' t the faintest idea what you' re talking about .
well mind , it' s not my place to say , but what she' s probably got in mind ... is a jolly holiday somewheres or other .
something along these lines , i shouldn' t be surprised .
punting on the thames . " that' s always good if you like an outing .

a typical english countryside ... as done by a true and lovin ' hand .
though you can' t see it , there' s a little country fair ... down that road and uh , over the hill .
i don' t see any road .

having your picture taken for the newspaper .

besides having your extreme good looks , if i may say so .
oh , well , i wouldn' t go ...
there probably aren' t words to describe your emotions .
now , now , now , now , gentlemen , please .
on the contrary , there' s a very good word .
am i right , bert ?
tell ' em what it is .
right !
it' s supercalifragilistic expialidocious
even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious
if you say it loud enough you' il always sound precocious
supercalifragilistic expialidocious
um diddle diddle diddle , um diddle ay um diddle diddle diddle , um diddle ay
um diddle diddle diddle , um diddle ay um diddle diddle diddle , um diddle ay
because i was afraid to speak when i was just a lad
me father gave me nose a tweak and told me i was bad
but then one day i learned a word that saved me achin ' nose
the biggest word you ever heard and this is how it goes

you know , you can say it backwards , which is ... dociousaliexpistic fragilcalirupus .
but that' s going a bit too far , don' t you think ?
indubitably .
so when the cat has got your tongue there' s no need for dismay
here , here !
just summon up this word and then you' ve got a lot to say
but better use it carefully or it could change your life
for example .
yes ?
one night i said it to me girl , and now me girl' s me wife .

no , no , i won' t take your nasty medicine !
do we have to , mary poppins ?
people who get their feet wet must learn to take their medicine .
i don' t want it .
i' m not gonna ...
oh !
lime cordial !
delicious !
strawberry !
mmm !
r r rum punch .
quite satisfactory .
mary poppins , you won' t ever leave us , will you ?
do you have a handkerchief under your pillow ?
mm hmm .
will you stay if we promise to be good ?
och !
that' s a piecrust promise .
easily made , easily broken .
whatever would we do without you ?
i shall stay until the wind changes .
but , mary poppins , how long will that be ?
silence , please .
it' s time to go to sleep .
oh , we couldn' t possibly go to sleep !
so many lovely things have happened today .
did they ?
yes !
when we jumped into bert' s chalk picture .
and we rode the merry go round , and all the horses jumped off , and ...
and we all went riding in the countryside !
tally ho !
tchunga !
tchunga !
yikes !
really ?
mary poppins , don' t you remember ?
you won the horse race !
a respectable person like me in a horse race ?
how dare you suggest such a thing .
but i saw you do it !
now , not another word or i shall have to summon the policeman .
is that clear ?
it did happen !
i saw it !
go to sleep .
no , i don' t want to go to sleep .
mary poppins , we' re much too excited !
very well , suit yourselves .
stay awake
don' t rest your head
don' t lie down
upon your bed
while the moon drifts
in the skies
stay awake
don' t close your eyes
though the world
is fast asleep
though your pillow' s
soft and deep
you' re not sleepy
as you seem
stay awake
don' t nod
and dream
stay awake
don' t nod
and
dream
glorious day , mr binnacle .
glorious !
no one sleeps this morning .
put in a double charge of powder .
a double charge ?
aye , aye , sir .
shake things up a bit , what ?
lovely , lovely morning , ellen .
indeed it is , ma' am .
have you put the spoiled eggs in my carryall ?
yes , ma' am .
after our meeting at the albert hall , we' re all going to downing street ... to throw things at the prime minister .
oh , how distinguished you look this morning , george .
what' s all that fearful caterwauling in the kitchen ?
it' s cook singing .
cook singing ?
what' s wrong with her ?
she' s happy as a cricket .
as a matter of fact ... since you hired mary poppins , the most extraordinary thing ...
seems to have come over the household .
is that so ?
take ellen for instance .
she hasn' t broken a dish all morning .
really ?
well , that is extraordinary .
and another thing .
she and cook usually fight like cats and dogs , but today ...
let me hold the door for you , ellen dear .
thanks ever so , ducks .
ellen , stop making that offensive noise !
and shut the window !
that bird' s giving me a headache .
yes , sir .
quiet !
you' re giving the master an headache .
i' m so sorry you' re not feeling well this morning , george .
who said i' m not feeling well ?
i' m fit as a fiddle .
i just don' t understand why everyone' s so confoundedly cheerful !
supercalifragilistic expialidocious
supercalifragilistic expialidocious
supercalifragilistic expialidocious how lovely .
thank you , my darling .
supercalifragilistic expialidocious
supercalifragilistic expialidocious
stop !
stop !
stop !
good morning , father .
good morning .
mary poppins taught us the most wonderful words .
supercalifragilistic expialidocious
what on earth are you talking about ?
supercali ...
super ...
or whatever the infernal thing is .
it' s something to say when you don' t know what to say .
yes , well , i always know what to say .
go on , hurry along , please .
yes , father .
supercalifragilistic expialidocious
winifred , will you be good enough to explain this unseemly hullabaloo ?
i don' t think there' s anything to explain .
do you ?
it' s obvious that you' re out of sorts this morning .
the children just came in to make you feel better .
i should like to make one thing quite clear , once and for all .
i am not out of sorts .
i am in a perfectly equable mood .
i do not require being made to feel better !
but you' re always saying that you wanted a cheerful and pleasant household .
winifred , i should like to make a slight differentiation ... between the word cheerful and just plain giddy irresponsibility .
excuse me , dear .
posts , everyone , please !
i have no objection to anyone being cheerful or pleasant .
but i do expect a certain decorum .
i can tell you one thing , winifred .
i don' t propose standing idly by ... and letting that woman , mary poppins , undermine the discipline and ...
there' s something odd , i may say extremely odd ... about the behaviour of this household since that woman arrived .
and i want you to know that i' ve noticed it !
yes , dear .
one thing more .
yes , dear ?
i suggest you have this piano repaired .
when i sit down to an instrument , i like to have it in tune .
but , george , you don' t play .
madam , that is entirely beside the point !
now , let me see .
first of all , we must go to the piano tuners .
and then we go to mrs cory' s sh ...
mrs cory' s shop for some gingerbread .
ah , gingerbread !
and then we go to the fishmonger' s , i think , for a nice dover sole ... and a pint of prawns .
uh , michael , stop stravaging along behind .
ahoy , there !
ahoy !
good day to you !
good morning , admiral .
michael , what fine adventure are we off upon today ?
going to fight the hottentots ?
dig for buried treasure ?
we' re going to buy some fish .
very good !
proceed at flank speed .
aye , aye , sir .
let' s put our backs into it , lad .
more spit and polish .
that' s what' s wanted around here .
it' s andrew !
uh , not so fast , please .
i can' t understand a word you' re saying .
again ?
och !
oh , the poor man !
bless you .
well , yes , of course .
there' s not a moment to lose .
i' il go straightaway .
and thank you very much .
what did he say ?
he said , " you' re welcome " .
what else did he say ?
i don' t think he said anything .
you know best , as usual .
i thought we were gonna buy some fish .
there' s been a change of plans .
come along , please .
don' t straggle .
andrew , worrying won' t help anyone .
why don' t you go home and put your feet up ?
oh , bert , i' m glad you' re here .
i came over the moment i heard .
well , how is he ?
i' ve never seen him as bad as this , and that' s the truth .
oh !
how about them ?
it' s contagious , you know .
shall we get spots ?
oh , highly unlikely .
oh , uncle albert !
oh , bless me .
bless my soul .
it' s mary poppins !
i' m delight ...
i' m delighted to see you , mary .
uncle albert , you promised !
oh , i kn ...
i know , i ...
but i tried .
really , i did , my dear .
i ...
but i so enjoy laughing , you know ?
and , well ...
and when i start , it' s all up with the ...
that' s what happens to me .
i love to laugh !
oh , my goodness !
i can' t help it .
you can see that .
i just like laughing , that' s all .
jane , don' t you dare !
you' il only make him worse .
it' s really quite serious !
yes , whatever you do , keep a straight face .
last time , it took us three days to get him down .
i love to laugh
loud and long and clear
i love to laugh
it' s getting worse every year
the more i laugh
the more i fill with glee
you' re no help at all .
the more the glee
the more i' m a merrier me
it' s embarrassing .
the more i' m a merrier me
some people laugh through their noses
sounding something like this
dreadful !
some people laugh through their teeth , goodness sakes
hissing and fizzing like snakes
not at all attractive to my way of thinking .
some laugh too fast
some only blast
others , they twitter like birds
you know , you' re as bad as he is .
then there' s that kind what can' t make up their mind
when things strike me as funny
i can' t hide it inside and squeak
as the squeakelers do
i' ve got to let go with a ho ho ho ho
and laugh
too
how nice !
i was hoping you' d turn up .
turn up !
we always have such a jolly time .
we love to laugh
loud and long and clear
we love to laugh
so everybody can hear
the more you laugh
whoops , don' t you two start .
come back down here .
the more you fill with glee
the more the glee
the more we' re a merrier we
oh , welcome , children !
welcome !
make yourselves comfortable .
that' s right .
pull up a chair .
oh , pull up ...
i must say , you' re a sight , the lot of you !
speaking of sight , it reminds me of me brother .
he' s got a nice cushy job in a watch factory .
in a watch factory ?
what does he do ?
he stands about all day and makes faces !
he makes faces in a watch fact ...
you made that up .
i know .
that' s so good !
such behaviour !
well , it' s the most disgraceful sight i' ve ever seen , or my name isn' t mary poppins .
speaking of names , i know a man with a wooden leg named smith .
what' s the name of his other leg ?
wasn' t that funny ?
what' s the name of his other ...
now , then , children , it' s time for tea .
i will not have my schedule interrupted .
oh , please stay .
look , i have a splendid tea all ready for you .
and it' s getting cold !
well , i had hoped that maybe , that you would just , that ...
splendid !
thank you very much !
keep your feet back .
mind the bread and butter .
now , watch it , children .
i knew she could bring it off .
and a proper tea it is too .
next thing , i suppose , you' il be wanting me to pour out .
oh , well .
if i must , i must .
if you' il just stop behaving like a pack of laughing hyenas !
two lumps , uncle albert ?
yes , please .
uh , bert ?
uh , no , no , thank you .
no sugar for me .
i' m so glad you came .
it wouldn' t be any fun without you .
here , and you may pour some milk for michael and yourself .
nice weather we' re having this time of year , don' t you think ?
oh , yeah .
uh , speaking of weather ... the other day when it was so cold ... a friend of mine went to buy some long underwear , you know .
the shopkeeper said to him , " how long do you want it ?
and my friend said , " well , from about september to march .
jane !
control yourself !
children , will you please sit up properly at the table ?
your tea , uncle albert .
oh , thank you , my dear .
i' m having such a good time .
i wish that you could all stay up here all the time .
we' il jolly well have to .
there' s no way to get down .
oh , no , there is a way .
frankly i , i don' t like to mention it ... because you have to think of something sad .
then do get on with it , please !
let me see .
i' ve got the very thing .
yesterday when the lady next door answered the bell , there was a man there .
and the man said to the lady , " i' m terribly sorry .
i just ran over your cat .
oh , that' s sad .
the poor cat .
and then the man said , " i' d like to replace your cat .
and the lady said , " that' s all right with me , but how are you at catching mice ?
well , you know i started out sad .
i , i try , really i do .
but , but everything ends up so hilarious , i can' t ...
i can' t help ...
that will be quite enough of that !
it' s time to go home .
oh , that is sad .
oh , no !
oh , that' s sad .
that' s the saddest thing i ever heard .
come along , children .
spit spot !
must you really go ?
you know , people come to see me all the time , you know .
and , and we have such a lovely time , and then they have to go home .
and , and i' m very , very sad about the whole thing .
don' t worry .
we' il come back soon .
we had a lovely time .
uh , keep an eye on uncle albert , will you , bert ?
i' il sit with him a while .
thank you .
come on .
uncle albert , i got a jolly joke i saved for just such an occasion .
would you like to hear it ?
i' d be so grateful .
righto .
well , it' s about me granddad , see ?
and one night , he had a nightmare , he did .
so scared that he chewed his pillow to bits .
yes .
to bits .
yes .
next morning i says ...
" how do you feel , granddad ?
yes .
he says , " oh , not bad .
a little down in the mouth !
yeah , i always say there' s nothing like a good joke .
no .
and that was nothing like a good joke !
that ...
bit late tonight , aren' t you , banks ?
i say , banks !
is anything the matter , banks ?
banks !
oh , father , we' re so glad you' re home !
want to hear a joke ?
we had the most wonderful afternoon with mary poppins .
speaking of afternoons , the joke goes like this .
i know a man with a wooden leg named smith .
smith ?
we don' t know anyone called smith .
and there was a second chap , and the second chap says , " what' s the name of his other leg ?
and we had a lovely tea party on the ceiling !
oh , children , please be quiet .
mary poppins says if we' re good , she' il take us there again .
oh .
oh , mary poppins said that , did she ?
will you please return to your room .
mary poppins , will you be kind enough to come with me ?
as you wish .
mary poppins , i very much regret what i must say to you .
good evening , george .
is anything the matter ?
i' m afraid there is .
i , i' d love to stay , but i have to dress for my rally in hampstead .
winifred , it is my wish that you be present !
oh , yes , george , of course .
mary poppins , i must confess i am extremely disappointed in you .
she' s for it now .
i' ve heard the master do this speech before .
i don' t deny that i am partially responsible for allowing the children ... to spend their days on worthless frivolity to the exclusion of all else !
but it is high time they learned the seriousness of life !
but , george , they' re only children .
precisely .
and in the light of what has happened ...
george , are you certain you know what you' re doing ?
i believe i do , winifred .
a british bank is run with precision
a british home requires nothing less
tradition , discipline and rules must be the tools
without them disorder , chaos
moral disintegration
in short you have a ghastly mess i quite agree .
the children must be moulded shaped and taught
that life' s a looming battle to be faced and fought
in short , i am disturbed to hear my children talking about ... popping in and out of chalk pavement pictures ... consorting with racehorse persons , fox hunting .
yes , well i don' t mind that quite so much .
at any rate , it' s traditional .
but tea parties on the ceiling ?
i ask you .
having tea parties on the ceiling and highly questionable outings of every other kind !
if they must go on outings these outings ought to be
fraught with purpose yes , and practicality
these silly words like
superca ...
super ...
superca ...
supercalifragilistic expialidocious .
yes , well done .
you said it .
and popping through pictures
have little use fulfil no basic need
they' ve got to learn the honest truth
despite their youth they must learn
about the life you lead exactly .
they must feel the thrill of totting up a balanced book
a thousand ciphers neatly in a row quite right .
when gazing at a graph that shows the profits up
their little cup of joy should overflow precisely !
it' s time they learned to walk in your footsteps my footsteps .
to tread your straight and narrow path with pride with pride .
tomorrow just as you suggest pressed and dressed
jane and michael will be at your side
splendid !
you hit the nail right on the ...
at my side ?
where are we going ?
to the bank , of course , exactly as you proposed .
i proposed ?
of course .
now , if you' il excuse me .
tomorrow' s an important day for the children .
i shall see they have a proper night' s sleep .
good night .
winifred , did i say that i was going to take the children to the bank ?
it certainly sounded that way , dear .
oh .
and why not ?
a capital idea !
just the medicine they need for all this slipshod , sugary ... female thinking they get around here all day long .
quite right .
good idea .
quite right .
good idea .
quite right .
mary poppins , we won' t let you go !
go ?
what on earth are you talking about ?
didn' t you get sacked ?
sacked ?
certainly not !
i am never sacked !
oh , mary poppins !
hurrah , hurray , hurray ,
hurray , hurray , hurray ...
neither am i a maypole .
kindly stop spinning about me .
but ?
goats butt , birds fly ... and children who are going on an outing with their father must get some sleep .
come along , please .
an outing with father ?
yes .
i don' t believe it .
he' s never taken us on an outing before .
he' s never taken us anywhere .
however did you manage it ?
manage what ?
you must' ve put the idea in his head somehow .
what an impertinent thing to say !
me putting ideas into people' s heads ?
really !
where' s he taking us ?
to the bank .
oh , michael , the city !
and we' il see all the sights , and father can point them out to us .
well , most things he can .
but sometimes a person we love through no fault of his own ...
can' t see past the end of his nose .
past the end of his nose ?
yes .
sometimes a little thing can be quite important .
oh , look !
the cathedral .
father passes that every day .
he sees that .
early each day to the steps of st paul' s
the little old bird woman comes
in her own special way
to the people she calls
come buy my bags
full of crumbs
come feed the little birds
show them you care
and you' il be glad if you do
their young ones are hungry
their nests are so bare
all it takes is tuppence from you
feed the birds
tuppence a bag
tuppence , tuppence
tuppence a bag
feed the birds
that' s what she cries
while overhead
her birds fill the skies
all around the cathedral the saints and apostles
look down as she sells her wares
although you can' t see it
you know they are smiling
each time someone shows
that he cares
though her words
are simple and few
listen , listen
she' s calling to you
feed the birds
tuppence a bag
tuppence , tuppence
tuppence a bag
though her words
are simple and few
listen , listen
she' s calling to you
feed the birds
tuppence a bag
tuppence , tuppence
tuppence
a bag
now remember that a bank is a quiet and decorous place , so we must be on our best behaviour .
but i thought it was your bank .
yes , well , i' m one of the younger officers ... so in a sense it is , sort of .
michael , look !
it' s her !
who ?
it' s who ?
the bird woman .
just where mary poppins said she would be .
you do see her , don' t you , father ?
well , of course i can see her .
do you think i can' t see past the end of my nose ?
listen , father , she' s saying it .
feed the birds .
tuppence a bag .
well , of course she' s saying it .
what else would she be saying ?
please may we feed the birds ?
whatever for ?
i have tuppence from my money box .
just this once , please ?
waste your money on a lot of ragamuffin birds ?
certainly not .
but mary poppins ...
i am not interested in what mary poppins says .
nor do i wish to keep hearing her name for the remainder of the day .
now come along !
but it' s my tuppence !
michael , i will not permit you to throw your money away !
when we get to the bank , i shall show you what may be done with your tuppence .
and i think you' il find it extremely interesting .
hello , banks .
what' s all this about ?
these are my children , mr dawes .
well , so i assumed .
but why are they here ?
they wish to open an account , sir .
oh , indeed ?
yes .
and just how much money do you have , young man ?
tuppence .
but i want it to feed the birds .
shh , shh , shh , shh , shh .
tuppence ?
tuppence ?
precisely how i started .
that' s the chairman of the bank , the elder mr dawes .
a giant in the world of finance .
a giant ?
shh , shh , shh .
uh , father , these are banks' s children .
they want to open an account .
oh , they do , do they , boy ?
excellent .
excellent .
we can al always use ... al always use more money to , to put to work for the bank , can' t we , boy ?
so , you have tuppence ?
may i be permitted to see it ?
no .
i want it to feed the birds !
fiddlesticks , boy !
feed the birds and what have you got ?
fat birds !
but if you invest your tuppence
wisely in the bank
safe and sound
soon that tuppence safely invested in the bank
will compound
and you' il achieve that sense of conquest
as your affluence expands
in the hands
of the directors
who invest
as propriety demands
may i , sir ?
carry on , banks .
you see , michael , you' il be part of ...
railways through africa exactly !
dams across the nile the ships .
tell them about the ships .
fleets of ocean greyhounds more , tell them more !
majestic self amortizing canals
oh , it fires the imagination !
plantations of ripening
tea
all from
tuppence prudently thriftily , frugally
invested in the to be specific
in the dawes , tomes mousley , grubbs
fidelity fiduciary bank
very well , my boy , give me the money .
no , i won' t !
i want it to feed the birds .
banks !
yes , sir .
now , michael .
when you deposit tuppence in a bank account
go on !
soon you' il see
tell him more !
that it blooms into credit of a generous amount
semiannually
and you' il achieve that sense of stature
as your influence expands
to the high financial strata
that established credit now commands
you can purchase first and second trust deeds .
think of the foreclosures !
bonds , chattels , dividends , shares .
bankruptcies .
debtor sales .
opportunities .
all manner of private enterprise .
shipyards .
the mercantile .
collieries .
tanneries .
corporations .
amalgamations .
banks !
while stand the banks of england ...
england stands .
oh , oh , oh , oh !
when fall the banks of england ...
england falls !
you see , michael ?
all for the lack of ...
tuppence patiently , cautiously trustingly invested in the
to be specific in the
dawes , tomes , mousley , grubbs
fidelity fiduciary bank
welcome to our joyful family of investors .
give it back !
gimme back my money !
michael , behave .
banks !
give it to me !
michael , behave .

stop those children !
come with me , my dears .
granny' il hide you !
here , here , half a mo .
leave her alone !
leave my sister alone !
easy , now .
your old friend ain' t gonna hurt ya .
bert , it' s you !
in the flesh , and at your service .
you' re filthy !
oh , perhaps a smudge or two .
it so happens that today i' m a chimney sweep .
oh , bert , we' re so frightened .
now , now , don' t take on so .
bert' il take care of you like i was your own father .
now , who' s after you ?
father is .
what ?
he brought us to see his bank .
i don' t know what we did , but it must' ve been something dreadful .
he sent the police after us , and the army and everything .
michael , don' t exaggerate .
well , now , there must be some mistake .
your dad' s a fine gentleman and he loves ya !
i don' t think so .
you should' ve seen the look on his face .
he doesn' t like us at all .
well , now that don' t seem likely , does it ?
it' s true .
let' s sit down .
you know , begging your pardon ... but the one my heart goes out to is your father .
there he is in that cold , heartless bank day after day ... hemmed in by mounds of cold , heartless money .
i don' t like to see any living thing caged up .
father in a cage ?
they makes cages in all sizes and shapes , you know .
bank shaped some of ' em , carpets and all .
father' s not in trouble .
we are .
oh , sure about that , are you ?
look at it this way .
you' ve got your mother to look after you .
and mary poppins , and constable jones and me .
who looks after your father ?
tell me that .
when something terrible happens , what does he do ?
fends for himself , he does .
who does he tell about it ?
no one !
don' t blab his troubles at home .
he just pushes on at his job , uncomplaining and alone and silent .
he' s not very silent !
michael , be quiet .
bert , do you think father really needs our help ?
well , not my place to say .
i only observe that a father can always do with a bit of help .
come on , i' il take you home .
chim chiminy , chim chiminy chim chim cheree
a sweep is as lucky as lucky can be
chim chiminy , chim chiminy chim chim cheroo
good luck will rub off when i shakes hands with you
or blow me a kiss
and that' s lucky too
now as the ladder of life has been strung
you might think a sweep' s on the bottommost rung
though i spends me time in the ashes and smoke
in this whole wide world there' s no happier bloke
chim chiminy , chim chiminy chim chim cheree
a sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

he' il feel much better if you shake hands with him .
it' s the children , ma' am .
oh , i thought they were with their father .
you haven' t been running off again , have you ?
you know how terribly it upsets me .
oh , they haven' t exactly been running away , ma' am .
they have had bit of a fright , though .
need someone to look after ' em .
oh , of course !
mary poppins will .
oh , no , it' s her day off !
ellen , i wonder if you would ...
no , ma' am .
i haven' t done me brasses yet .

what about you , sir ?
you' ve been so kind in looking after the children .
wh ...
uh , me , ma' am ?
w well , well , i i i have to be moving along .
the lord mayor' s got a stopped up chimney .
chimney .
how clever of you to know .
our drawing room chimney' s in the most ghastly condition .
smokes incessantly .
w w ...
thank you so much !
but ...
besides , it' il amuse the children .
the lord mayor' s gonna be terrible put out .
oh , thank you so much .
i do appreciate it .
i must hurry .
our gallant ladies in prison are waiting for me to lead them in song !
goodbye , my darlings .
see you soon .
i choose me bristles with pride , yes , i do
a broom for the shaft and a brush for the flue
oh , it' s awfully dark and gloomy up there .
there now .
you see how wrong people can be ?
that there is what you might call a doorway to a place of enchantment .
up where the smoke is all billowed and curled
' tween pavement and stars
is the chimney sweep world
when there' s hardly no day
nor hardly no night
there' s things half in shadow
and halfway in light
on the rooftops of london
coo , what a sight .
i do wish we could go up there .
so do i !
i like chimneys .
oh , rightly so !
a chimney is a wondrous thing .
she' s built tall right up there on the roof .
when the wind is just right , it blows across her top ... then draws the smoke right up the flue .
here .
feel the pull on the end of that brush .
it' s like i got a whale on the end of the line , ain' t it ?
michael , be careful .
you never know what may happen around a fireplace .
oh , bother !
michael !
michael , come back down here .
michael !
michael , where are you ?
well , that' s a bit awkward .
i must say !
bert , i' il thank you to stop putting ideas in their heads !
there goes the other one .
shall i go after ' em ?
well , we can' t have them gallivanting up there like kangaroos , can we ?
michael , don' t be frightened .
everything' s going ...
will you put your things on at once ?
hurry up , please .
spit spot !
here you are !
i thought you' d left us .
we didn' t mean to .
well , no harm done .
the truth is ... this is what you might call a fortuitous circumstance .
look there .
a trackless jungle just waiting to be explored .
why not , mary poppins ?
oh , please , mary poppins ?
please !
oh , well .
if we must , we must .
fall in .
look lively , look lively .
jump to it !
jump to it !
get in line .
attention !
a show arms !
a right turn !
quick march !
hello there !
it' s just good , clean soot , michael .
as far as we go , right ?
not at all .
what did i tell ya ?
there' s the whole world at your feet .
and who gets to see it , but the birds , the stars and the chimney sweeps ?
quite nice , but we should all get in out of the night air .
follow me , please .

come along , children .
spit spot .
just a moment , mary poppins .
what is the meaning of this outrage ?
i beg your pardon ?
will you be good enough to explain all this ?
first of all , i would like to make one thing quite clear .
yes ?
i never explain anything .
yes .
banks here .
mr dawes !
i' m most dreadfully sorry , sir , about what happened at the bank today .
i can assure you that ...
tonight , sir ?
yes , banks .
we' il expect you at 9 : 00 precisely .
without fail .
without fail .
why , yes , banks .
it' s extremely serious .
we regret this course of action .
we regret this course of action .
after all , you have been with us a good many years .
after all , you have been with us a good many years .
as was your father before you .
as was your father before you .
yes , mr dawes .
i shall be there at 9 : 00 .
a man has dreams of walking with giants .
to carve his niche in the edifice of time .
before the mortar of his zeal
has a chance to congeal
the cup is dashed from his lips !
the flame is snuffed a borning .
he' s brought to wrack and ruin in his prime .
life is a rum go , guv' nor .
and that' s the truth .
you know what i think ?
it' s that woman mary poppins .
from the moment she stepped into this house , things began to happen to me !
mary poppins ?
yes , yes , of course .
my world was calm
well ordered exemplary .
then came this person
with chaos in her wake
and now my life' s ambitions go
with one fell blow
it' s quite a bitter pill
to take .
it' s that poppins woman !
she did it !
i know the very person you mean .
mary poppins .
she' s the one what sings ...
a spoonful of sugar
that is all it takes
it changes bread and water
into tea and cakes
you see ?
that' s exactly what i mean !
changing bread and water into tea and cakes !
indeed !
no wonder everything' s higgledy piggledy here .
a spoonful of sugar
goes a long , long way
have yourself a healthy helpin '
every day
an healthy helpin ' of trouble , if you ask me .
do you know what she did ?
i realize it now .
she tricked me into taking jane and michael to the bank .
that' s how all the trouble started .
tricked you into taking the children on an outing ?
yes .
outrageous !
a man with all the important things you have to do .
shameful !
you' re a man of high position .
esteemed by your peers .
and when your little tykes are cryin '
you haven' t time to dry their tears
and see them grateful little faces
smilin ' up at you
because their dad
he always knows just what to do
well , i mean , look , i , i don' t think i ca ...
like you say , guv' nor .
you' ve got to grind , grind , grind
at that grindstone
though childhood slips
like sand through a sieve
and all too soon they' ve up and grown
and then they' ve flown
and it' s too late
for you to give
just that spoonful of sugar
to help the medicine go down
the medicine go down
medicine go down
well , goodbye , guv' nor .
sorry to have troubled you .
father ?
we' re sorry about the tuppence .
we didn' t know it would cause you so much trouble .
here , father , you can have the tuppence .
will that make everything all right ?
thank you .
come in !
take your hat off , banks .
good evening , gentlemen .
well , get on with it .
go on .
uh , yes , father .
in 1773 , an official of this bank ... unwisely loaned a large sum of money ... to finance a shipment of tea to the american colonies .
do you know what happened ?
yes , sir .
yes , i think i do .
uh , uh , as the ship lay in boston harbor ... uh , a party of the colonists dressed as red indians ... uh , boarded the vessel , behaved very rudely , and , and threw all the tea overboard .
this made the tea unsuitable for drinking ... even for americans .
precisely .
the loan was defaulted .
panic ensued within these walls .
there was a run on the bank !
from that time to this , sir ... there has not been a run on this bank ... until today !
a run , sir , caused by the disgraceful conduct of your son .
do you deny it ?
i do not deny it , sir .
and i shall be only too glad to assume responsibility for my son .
what are you waiting for ?
get on with it !
uh , y yes , father .
no , not that !
steady on .
well , do you have anything to say , banks ?
well , sir , they do say that ... when there' s nothing to say , all you can say i ...
confound it , banks !
i said , do you have anything to say ?
just one word , sir .
yes ?
supercalifragilistic expialidocious .
what ?
supercalifragilistic expialidocious .
mary poppins was right .
it' s extraordinary .
it does make you feel better !
what are you talking about , man ?
there' s no such word .
oh , yes .
it is a word .
a perfectly good word , actually .
do you know what there' s no such thing as ?
it turns out , with due respect , when all is said and done ... that there' s no such thing as you !
impertinence , sir !
speaking of impertinence ... would you like to hear a perfectly marvellous joke ?
a real snapper !
joke ?
snapper ?
yes .
there are these two wonderful young people , jane and michael .
and they meet one day on the street , and jane says to michael ...
i know a man with a wooden leg named smith .
and michael says , " really ?
what' s the name of his other leg ?
the man' s gone mad .
call the guard !
supercalifragilistic expialidocious .
i' m feeling better all the time !
banks , don' t you dare strike my father !
there' s the tuppence .
the wonderful , fateful ... supercalifragilistic expialidocious tuppence .
guard it well .
goodbye !
banks , where are you going ?
i don' t know .
i might pop through a chalk pavement picture , and go for an outing in the country .
or i might seize a horse off a merry go round , and win the derby !
or i might just fly a kite !
only poppins would know !
poppins ?
my nanny .
she' s the one who sings that ridiculous song .
a spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down
the medicine go down
the medicine go down the medicine ...
mad as a march hare .
a wooden leg named smith .
a wooden leg named smith .
a wooden le ...
father ?
father !
father , come down !
daddy !
daddy , come back !
wind' s come around , blowing dead on from the west !
she doesn' t care what happens to us .
she only promised to stay till the wind changed .
isn' t that right , mary poppins ?
will you bring me my hat stand , please ?
mary poppins , don' t you love us ?
and what would happen to me , may i ask ... if i loved all the children i said goodbye to ?
yes , sir , that' s right .
george w. banks .
17 cherry tree lane .
about six foot one , i' d say , sir .
oh , yes , we rang up his bank first thing this morning .
the only thing we discovered was , he' d been discharged last night .
no telling what he might do in a fit of despondency .
wouldn' t hurt to have them drag the river .
there' s a nice spot there by suffolk bridge .
popular with jumpers .
really , ellen !
he seemed to have been a fine , stable gentleman , sir .
no hanky panky , if you know what i mean .
oh , regular habits , sir .
well , far as anyone knows .
the medicine go down
the medicine go down
just a spoonful of sugar it' s him !
helps the medicine or something that sounds like him .
go down mrs banks , could we have a little less noise ...
on the premises ?
i can' t make out what the inspector' s sayin ' .
in the most delightful way
just a spoonful of sugar
makes the medicine go down george !
oh , george , you didn' t jump in the river .
how sensible of you .
it' s all right , sir .
he' s been found !
no , alive !
or so i presume .
he' s a kissin ' a mrs. banks .
i' ve been so worried .
what happened at the bank ?
i' ve been sacked , discharged , flung into the street .
a spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down
gone off his crumpet .
that' s what he' s done .
the medicine go down dotty as you please .
george , what on earth were you doing in the cellar ?
you' il see in a moment .
where are the children ?
jane ?
michael ?
your father' s calling you .
it doesn' t sound like father .
jane ?
michael ?
run along .
spit spot !
you won' t go , mary poppins , will you ?
spit spot .
he mended it !
it' s wonderful !
however did you manage it ?
with tuppence for paper and strings
you can have your own set of wings
with your feet on the ground you' re a bird in flight
with your fist holding tight
to the string of your kite
oh , oh , oh
let' s go fly a kite
up to the highest height
let' s go fly a kite
and send it soaring
up through the atmosphere
up where the air is clear
oh , let' s go fly a kite
a proper kite needs a proper tail , don' t you think ?
that' s what i said , sir .
go fly a kite !
oh , no , sir .
no , i , i don' t mean you personally .
let' s go fly a kite
up to the highest height
let' s go fly a kite
and send it soaring
up through the atmosphere
up where the air is clear
oh , let' s go fly a kite
when you send it flying up there
all at once you' re lighter than air
you can dance on the breeze over houses and trees
with your fist holding tight
to the string of your kite
oh , oh , oh now !
let' s go fly a kite
up to the highest height
let' s go fly a kite
and send it soaring
oh , there you are , banks .
i want to congratulate you .
capital bit of humour .
wooden leg named smith .
or jones or whatever it was .
father died laughing .
oh , i' m so sorry , sir .
oh , no , nonsense .
nothing to be sorry about .
never seen him happier in his life .
he left an opening for a new partner .
congratulations .
thank you , sir .
thank you very much indeed , sir .
up through the atmosphere
up where the air is clear
oh , let' s go
fly a kite
that' s gratitude for you .
didn' t even say goodbye .
no , they didn' t .
look at them .
you know , they think more of their father than they do of you .
that' s as it should be .
well , don' t you care ?
practically perfect people never permit sentiment to muddle their thinking .
is that so ?
well , i' il tell you one thing , mary poppins , you don' t fool me a bit .
oh , really ?
yes , really .
i know exactly how you feel about these children .
and if you think i' m gonna keep my mouth shut any longer , i ...
that will be quite enough of that , thank you .
goodbye , mary poppins .
don' t stay away too long .
oh , oh , oh
let' s go fly a kite
up to the highest height
let' s go fly a kite
and send it soaring
up through the atmosphere
up where the air is clear
oh , let' s go
fly a kite
