is it bad tonight ?
bad .
that' s one way to describe it .
insane seems a iittle more appropriate .
it feels iike he' s breathing down my neck .
it is my professionai opinion we should get the heii out of here .
now .
noted .
clean this place up , then iocate our guests .
i just need to take the edge off .
you know the routine .
i need you clear headed .
first things first .
now , where is he ?
show me where he' s hiding .
son of a bitch !
you said he only kiiled nine people .
there are 40 victims here .
nine when he was alive .
he' s added a few since then .
now where is he , dennis ?
aii teams go to alpha .
bring in the cube !
how did this guy get the name " the breaker " ?
is he a truck driver ?
simple folkiore .
the iocai color exorcising its demons .
maybe it' s because he broke his victims into as many pieces as possible .
i hate being rushed .
this one isn' t iike the others .
i' ii give you a bonus .
you don' t have that kind of money .
after tonight you' ii be surprised .
now , get to work .
careful , dennis .
don' t get too curious .
son of a bitch !
how can you justify what you' re doing , cyrus ?
it' s out and out slavery !
you are persistent , damon .
and what about you , kalina ?
stiii carrying around those ridiculous quicksilver flares ?
you stiii have that quaint magicai book ?
these aren' t animals you' re capturing , they' re human beings .
they are dead human beings .
maybe you should join greenpeace .
throw blood on old women' s furs .
who are you to play god ?
playing is for children .
you' ii never puii it off .
not without the right speils .
that , and the thirteenth ghost .
thirteenth ghost ?
get them out of my sight !
we' ve wasted too much time already .
why did he say thirteenth ?
move the cube into position .
what' s he talking about , 13 ghosts ?
you contracted me for 12 ghosts !
the breaker is 12 !
i' m done after tonight , cyrus .
yes .
twelve and then one more .
i thought you were psychic !
that' s not how it works , and you know it !
there' s no time to argue .
release the bait !
what bait ?
we never needed bait before !
a truck fuii of blood ?
you' ve got to be shitting me .
oh , boy .
now ... ... power up the cube .

cyrus recorded this message six weeks ago .
he asked that it be played for you in the event of his death .
arthur ... ... it' s good to talk to you .
sadly , if you' re watching this now , it means i am no longer among the living .
happily , that makes you and your family my sole beneficiaries .
i' ve instructed my lawyer , mr. moss ... ... to deliver the essential elements in my last will and testament .
give it to them , ben .
a key ?
a key to what ?
a key to your new house .
what ?
this house is the fruit of my life' s work .
bathrooms .
everyone gets their own bathroom .
is this for real ?
it is a one of a kind home .
it' s my home , actually .
my home .
i have no complaints .
i' ve led an interesting life .
i have seen some amazing things .
but the only regret i have , is that i never got to know my nephew arthur ... ... nor appreciate the love of a family , like you have .
this house is my attempt to make up for that .
enjoy .
perhaps we' il meet again ... ... in another life .
wow !
when can we see it ?
the house is yours whenever you iike .
i' m heading up there after work .
if you want , you , your wife and kids
time out .
i am not the missus here .
my wife ....
my wife is ....
our mom got burned to death in a fire .
what ?
it' s true .
that' s enough , robert .
mr. moss , exactly where is this place ?
a couple hours drive from here , a town called willow grove ... ... just up the parkway .
it' s in a gorgeous area .
but i warn you , your uncle liked his privacy .
there isn' t a neighbor for miles .
come on .
hurry up .

so what ?
you think you' re so slick .

yeah .
that' s strange .
dad , it' s beautiful .
my god .
i' ve never seen anything iike it .
cool !
so futuroic .
it' s about time somebody showed up .
is this your place ?
who are you ?
i' m the power guy .

your house is knocking out the power of the whole tri quad area .
i need to get inside and check the breakers .
could you come back tomorrow ?
is that a possibility ?
tomorrow ?
let me see .
there are about 5, 570 houses right now without power .
my bosses kind of frown on that , so ....

no problem .
thank you .

bobby , give it a rest .
heilo .
wow !

i hope the bathroom' s in the basement .
it' s iike a funhouse .
it' s latin .
everything' s so beautiful .
family , just so we' re aii clear , miss maggie does not do windows .
wow !
what an incredible wealth of knowledge .
a samurai sword .
in your dreams , pal .
dad , this stuff must be worth a fortune .
yeah , that occurred to me , too .
oh , cyrus .
you crazy son of a bitch , what did you do ?
goodness .
it' s iike a cathedral .
no throwing stones .
it' s marvelous , though , isn' t it ?
a iiving work of art .
the sooner you show me where you hid the basement ... ... the sooner i can get my ass out of here .
i believe it' s down the hail .
it' s two doors on the right .
excuse me .
the construction is amazing .
i' m getting dizzy .
bobby .

your uncle was quite a coilector of many things .
i' ve marked where you' re supposed to sign , arthur .
okay , iook .
i didn' t want to bring this up in front of the kids ... ... but this place is beyond amazing .
i' m just a math teacher .
the taxes alone must be ....
i have nothing set aside .
to be honest , a fire took away everything .
arthur , you don' t need to worry .
cyrus was a genius when it came to finances .
basicaily , you and your family never have to worry about money again .
son of a bitch .
lookee here .
look , y' ail .
look , iook !

arthur ?
arthur , we' ve got to ....

the supernaturai realm has its own iaws .

the entire basement is fiiled with ghosts .

ghosts are around us aii the time .
most of them can' t hurt us .
most don' t want to .
ghosts here , ghosts there , no one cares .
but there are exceptions , iike this bad ass behind me .
those who die violently stay in a tortured realm , so that' s aii they know .
what is he doing ?
i don' t know .
i can' t see .
i don' t have the glasses .

victims ?
cyrus had a nasty habit of enslaving souls .
that' s why i' m here .
i intend to set them aii free .
listen to me .
i need to know ... ... how you got in here .
i slipped through an opening in the house when it shifted .
an opening where ?
it' s closed now .
it won' t happen again .
let me show you .
this is the arcanum .
many people died in the quest for this book .
it was written in the 15th century by an astrologer named basileus .
in it , he describes the making of a certain machine .
one that can see into the future .
he wrote it while he was under demonic possession .
i can' t believe cyrus built it .
built what ?
what are you talking about ?
basileus' s device .
we' re in the middle of a machine , designed by the devii and powered by the dead .
listen to me .
i don' t give a shit about any machine ... ... or devii or basileus or anything ... ... except getting my family the heii out of this place .
i came here to set the souls in this house free .
you want help , you have to help me first .
kathy , can you walk ?
kathy !

how could you help him without knowing what he was doing ?
i had my reasons .
money , you parasite .
you stole people' s souls for money !
how depraved is that ?
if you haven' t noticed , i' m a bit of a freak !
i come within 10 feet of anything dead , i go into seizures .
i touch somebody , a whole iife fuii of shit flashes in front of my eyes .
so , yeah , i' m depraved .
but cyrus was my friend , and he accepted me .
he didn' t accept you .
you' re so pathetic !
he used you .
shut up , both of you .
cut him some slack .
what difference does it make ?
you didn' t teii him , did you ?
teii me what ?
what now ?
about the fourth ghost .
don' t do this .
i didn' t teii him .
he has a right to know .
what about the fourth ghost ?
st. luke' s hospital .
six months ago .
you' re saying my wife' s spirit ... ... is trapped in this house ?
i didn' t know you .
i didn' t know her .
i didn' t know she had a husband .
why ?
in god' s name , why ?
teii me , why her ?
i don' t know .
cyrus handpicked them , including your wife .
i figured out who you were and i' ve been trying to help you .
you caii this help ?
she' s right !
this is aii your goddamn fault !
son of a bitch !
you can save her .
and your kids , too .
just iisten to me and believe me .
this house is not a house .
it is a machine .
a complete and faithfui re creation of basileus' s design .
according to this , there should be 12 earth bound spirits trapped inside .
see these ?
they represent the black zodiac .
the first born son .
i don' t want to play .
the torso .
the bound woman .
the withered lover .
jean .
bobby .
i love you .
the torn prince .
the angry princess .
i' m sorry .
the pilgrimess .
the great child and the dire mother .
the hammer .
the jackal .
and the juggernaut .
the machine required the energy ... ... of these specific spirits in order to bring it to iife .
once it engages , the spirits are released one by one .
the house then draws them to its center .
each one adds its energy to the machine , powering it up .
powering it up for what ?
to open the ocularis lnfernum .
what' s that ?
it' s latin .
ocularis lnfernum .
the eye of heil ?
very good .
the eye of heil .
i' m stuck in a glass house with crazy white people ....
go on .
in heil , there is an eye that sees everything , the past , the future ... ... heaven and earth , the blessed , the damned .
if knowledge is power , then the man who controls the ocularis ... ... would be the most powerfui man on earth .
your uncle .
great .
so ... ... how many ghosts have been set free ?
eleven .
and the house needs twelve .
no .
damon said something about thirteen .
that there are thirteen ghosts .
the thirteenth ghost is a fail safe .
to stop the process , the house needs a sacrifice of iife instead of death .
a wiiling , human sacrifice .
a sacrifice of the broken heart .
the only ghost to be created out of an act of pure iove .
you' re the thirteenth ghost .
the thirteenth spirit stands before the eye at the finai configuration .
as the eye opens , the spirit uses the power of iife ... ... to short circuit the system .
uses the power of iife how ?
by ieaping into the eye .
and arthur' s supposed to take this ieap ?
no fucking way , iady .
that' s suicide .
i won' t iet you do it .
you need to come up with something else .
that' s not working .
love is the most powerfui energy .
meaning ?
in order for you to save your children , you must trade your iife for theirs .
let me see this .
there' s got to be a better way .
i don' t read latin .
weil , we can try it the old fashioned way , my personai favorite .
nobody wiii be here to brag about it afterwards .
we need to come up with a game plan soon .
time' s running out .
are you going to blow the place up ?
the iast ghost is about to be released .
i know why you feei you have to do this .
get away from me .
psychics caii it a " iinking .
we iinked earlier .
i saw everything ... ... about jean , about you .
shut up .
i' m not going to iisten to this from you .
kalina is talking about suicide .
anything to save my kids .
it doesn' t add up .
it doesn' t make any sense .
there' s got to be a better way .
doesn' t add up " ?
what does add up here , dennis ?
how much of this equation makes any sense at ail ?
goddamn it .
goddamn it .
aii i can think about are my kids .
i don' t even know if they' re alive .
then iet' s go out there and find out .
one iast time , while there' s stiii time , you and me .
kalina ... ... no matter what i decide to do , or what happens to any of us ... ... are you sure you can you stop that machine ?
i' ve got enough explosives to blow us back to the 15th century .
okay .
how many flares do you have ieft ?
one , why ?
we' re going out again .
no fucking way , arthur .
you' re going to get yourself kiiled .
not if we take that .
ten minutes untii the ectoplasmic shit hits the fan .
go .
we' ii go down and buy you some time .
after you , captain america .
damn .
i just got my nails done .
here .
put these on .
come on , iet' s go !
there' s no place iike home .
there' s no place iike home .
there' s no place iike home .
there' s no place iike home .

kalina , get over here !

where is it ?
kalina ?
why are you so mad at me ?
i did everything you asked me to do .
i kiiled damon , i stole his speils .
i made sure your pathetic nephew didn' t get himself kiiled !
kalina !
where are the speils ?
you' re not mad at me , are you ?
of course not .
what is it ?
oh , shit .
there' s only room for one of us .
what are you doing ?
don' t worry , i' ve been iooking for a reason to iike myself for a iong time .
dennis , don' t do this !
hey , bro .
you ain' t nothing but a bitch !
dennis , no !
oh , my god .
what do we do now ?
your nephew believes that sacrificing himself wiii save his kids .
but he won' t do it unless his kids are in jeopardy .
weil , put them in jeopardy .
what ?
why not ?
but they' re kids .
greatness requires sacrifice .
now , i have a job to do .
and so have you .
do it .
do it !
yes .
and now to finish this .
oh , my god .
jean .
i loved you so much .

every waking moment , for years .
