don' t get me wrong , but it always gets so ... complicated .
yesterday i went to grab a beer at a costumeparty .
i wanted to get to bed early .
i ended up having a few too many , but at least i got to bed early .
ln a sense .
my name is jacob , by the way .
i' m the one on the bottom .
the girl on top is called ...
hey .
hello ?
i don' t even know your name .
who cares !
excuse me ...
i know had something to do to day .
i was supposed to be ... in church .
at a christening .
my niece' s !
shit !
i' m supposed to be her godfather !
i' m supposed to be at a christening .
i' m sorry , but women are lousy at handling rejection .
it' s about being responsible .
i am a lawyer , after all .
the woman of my llfe
aren' t we going inside ?
we did .
and came back out .
was there a fire drill ?
we' re done .
it started at ten .
no godfather in the picture ?
her godfather is in the picture .
these are my best friends .
tonje is my sister .
deep inside , i think she likes me .
but she equates being mature with always being on time .
her next baby is already due .
nine months and 15 minutes after stine .
tonje is very efficient .
fredrik doesn' t mind .
he thinks everything tonje says is fine .
fredrik is the perfect family man .
veronica is a butterfly who brightens up wherever she lands .
lately she' s been landing on me .
i have to remind her that we' re just friends .
john is my best friend .
he may be blind , but he' s the most clearsighted of us all .
and he' s stine' s godfather .
anne' s dream is to find a partner .
her odds have increased greatly since she came out of the closet .
sorry , fredrik .
i' m serious .
i got lost .
you' re unbelievable .
i won' t even ask what her name was .
a little big ?
at least it' s better than that rabbit suit .
don' t you look nice , jacob .
a little 1980s retro ?
what' s the matter with you ?
i hurt my back .
is nothing sacred to you , jacob ?
i had planned ...
a godfather supports and guides .
take a walk and calm her down .
any hot chicks here ?
hi .
good ?
it' s a little dry .
do you have children ?
no .
you view them as a reproduction of your own self complacency ?
no .
i have yet to find the woman i want to have them with .
some may say that' s a little premature .
these aren' t my condoms .
i' ve just borrowed the suit .
want me to take her ?
no , i' m fine .
who is that ?
you don' t have to sleep with every woman you meet , you know .
i don' t believe in any " woman of my life .
the only ones who have succeeded at that , are you and tonje .
hi , jacob sand .
that was the minister of commerce from cameroon .
does your back hurt ?
i just ... fell out of bed .
maybe you should see a doctor .
did you read about that guy who hit his leg ?
the sore got in fected .
he ended up with gangrene .
gangrene ?
he had to amputate his leg .
the infection paralyzed his speech center .
he hasn' t said a word since .
240 kroner .
i can just get off here .
hello , hello , hello ?
aren' t you going to invite me up ?
i am so incredibly tired .
i have had the day from hell .
and i would just make it worse ?
veronica ...
would you like to come up ?
veronica ...
i' ve started playing the sax .
i thought you played guitar .
no , guitar is so ...
but sax is raw and sexy .
turn off that music !
what about mountain climbing ?
that wasn' t for me .
but the sax is cool .
am i totally hopeless ?
you aren' t hopeless .
hi , ahmed .
sorry i' m so late .
hey , it worked out .
you are serious ?
you kidding !
no , the fax came in today .
and they can all come to norway ?
this is fantastic !
i cannot believe it !
careful .
i hurt my back .
sit down .
i know doctor .
this be very good .
fix everything .
you call .
say hello from me .
i' il call .
see you later .
jacob ?
i have sister .
later , ahmed .
tomorrow .
later !
ok , later .
it seemed bigger .
are the rising mains new or old ?
i didn' t ask .
i just asked if there were rising mains .
this is so boring !
one sure sign that you' re getting older ,
is that you go to more open houses than bars .
they' ve got a house and a kid .
all they' re missing is a saab station wagon .
they have a saab station wagon .
jacob !
maria ?
fred , this is my ... ex boyfriend , jacob .
fred .
jacob .
jacob ?
you' re the one with warts on your feet .
that didn' t dare operate .
you always slept with your socks on .
i see you haven' t changed .
i am very happy .
we are buying a house .
and you ?
i met a mother of four .
we live in a big house with apple trees
and kids running around drinking juice .
like a classical painting .
you haven' t matured at all .
we are leaving .
vamos !
cool uniform .
help for sore nipples
jacob sand ?
dr. bomann can see you now .
your back ?
yes .
many suffer from that .
you are in good hands now .
jacob sand is here .
nice to see you again .
likewise .
hey ...
i' m sorry about that commerce minister .
i hope you didn' t ...
does your back hurt ?
what ?
yes , down here .
take your coat off , and i' il have a look .
there ...
pull your shirt up , so i can feel .
did you twist it somehow , or did it just happen ?
i was lying down ...
and then i fell .
you fell while lying down ?
yes .
legs together .
can you bend forward ?
that hurts .
yes , a little bit .
you disappeared from the party .
i was just there as an interpreter .
lift your arms .
you speak cameroonian ?
i speak one of 250 cameroonian dialects .
lift your leg .
and now the other leg .
there .
that' s that .
are we done ?
it' s only muscular .
you' il be better in a few days .
aren' t you going to take any ...
no tests , nothing ?
not for your back .
but if you have anything else ...
i have been feeling listless lately .
do you have to take so many tests ?
we' ve checked your heart , kidneys , blood pressure , and lungs .
are you all right ?
i had forgotten why i never go to the doctor .
i took a urine sample .
i thought we could test your sperm .
test my sperm ?
what if you meet the love of your life ?
you can tell her you have top notch sperm .
you mean i have to ... ?
do you sell houses ?
how does that apply to my sperm ?
it doesn' t .
but you' re a lawyer .
i work primarily with asylum seekers .
immigration law .
that' s right .
too bad .
i' m considering selling mine .
oh , you mean real estate !
yes , that i do !
if you mean ...
is it a wooden house ?
stone ?
i do stone houses .
all kinds of real estate , actually .
you' il need this .
is it serious ?
only if you fail to sell it .
here' s my address .
hi .
hi .
i' m going out to dinner afterward .
come in .
there .
let' s see ...
here is the sitting room .
i thought we could start with the first floor .
i see you work in the public sector .
this was dad' s childhood home .
here is the sitting room , and pantry and kitchen .
are your parents alive ?
almost too much .
dad just got a motorcycle , mom got a lover in crete .
good genes , i see .
and the rest of your family ?
no nutcases or perverts ?
i have an uncle who' s a band leader .
that isn' t lethal .
it is for your social life ....
this should be an easy sell .
here is the small library , the guest bathroom ...
when are you selling ?
as soon as possible .
there is a bedroom , guest room ...
and if we continue over here ...
hello ?
do you have kids ?
this is my room .
is this yours ?
yes .
this is where i grew up .
i had that same dollhouse .
girls had to play with cars and boys had to play with dolls .
so i had that same dollhouse .
but what have you done ?
this isn' t ...
you know that' s the kitchen ?
yes .
what is that double bed doing in there ?
that' s the kitchen .
they' re sleeping in the kitchen .
so they can be next door to the baby .
my point is that you have too many kids .
you have five kids .
this is a mink' s nest .
you' ve squeezed in kids all over .
there are five siblings .
five ?
that' s too many .
you have to have five .
the playroom is up here .
but they sleep down here .
the baby can get colicky .
he sleeps alone , so he doesn' t wake the others .
you actually live in here .
let' s continue .
then we went into her room .
it was so ...
magical .
yes , but john ...
she' s stunning !
she' s your client .
i' m her patient .
i thought you feared doctors .
i' ve never met a woman like this who immediately ...
jacob ...
yes ?
are you going back to her house ?
yes .
why ?
i' m going with you .
you can' t do this on your own .
of course i can .
i' m a specialist in property law .
you don' t understand this .
i shouldn' t have mentioned her .
it' s about understanding people .
it' s about selling .
john , you' re blind .
jacob , you' re prejudiced .
i can always call her my self .
remember what we agreed on ?
i won' t speak until spoken to .
hi .
hi .
i brought john .
thought it would be good to get his opinion .
as far as the sales strategy goes , and how to prepare ...
that' s nice .
come in .
nina .
john .
i' ve heard so much about you .
i' ve been telling him about the house .
john has vast experience ... with houses like this .
beautiful .
let' s start with the first floor .
are you aware that jacob is head over heels in love with you ?
he didn' t dare come alone .
you may be his dream woman .
i' ve never seen him like this .
how was he before ?
he tended to bring out strong maternal feelings in women .
i can imagine .
you underestimate yourself , jacob .
behind that pretty face lie vast amounts of hidden philosophy .
he has wanted to ask you something , but hasn' t dared .
he wants to ask you out on a date .
ok ...
i' il call you .
this went great , jacob .
nothing to worry about at all .
i hate the saxophone !
i hate jan gar fucking barek !
what happened ?
i feel like a satellite dish sucking in signals .
why doesn' t anyone want me ?
plenty of people want you .
you don' t .
you just sleep with me .
hey ...
maybe we should stop doing that .
have you met someone else ?
why do you ask ?
why else would you stop sleeping with me ?
it' s just inevitable that one of us will get hurt .
you have met someone else .
veronica ...
why make all these demands that we can never fulfil , jacob ?
imagine if we could just ... be , and be satisfied with that .
imagine how wonderful that would be .
turn off that music !
you owe me a new broom !
cheers !
happy birthday , john .
thank you for coming .
hello ?
what' s this ?
a present from me .
you' re so sweet .
it' s ...
glasses !
look at those !
are they nice ?
plenty of room for your nose .
cheers !
dear john , happy birthday .
marte and i , we ...
we have some news as our present for you .
we are getting married .
married ?
congratulations !
when ?
in august .
that' s wonderful !
but you' ve only just met .
and now you' re getting married ?
yes .
i just think it' s a little early .
only three of us left .
don' t look at me .
what about you , jacob ?
jacob will search till he' s 100 .
no , jacob has been showing an interest in female doctors lately .
with his fear of doctors ?
he has a new " family doctor .
sometimes i wonder what you think with .
now what ?
what do you think ?
are you doing veronica ?
we' re just good friends .
you don' t sleep with your friends !
thank you , john .
you may want to straighten out your social antennas a little bit .
sorry .
veronica will be fine .
so will you .
i' m more concerned about tonje and fredrik .
they' re filing for separation .
at least , they have the paperwork .
but they' re planning to ... buy a house and have another kid .
heard anything from nina ?
thought i' d send her an e mail .
what are you going to write ?
that i think about her all the time .
is that wrong ?
no .
no , jacob .
that' s just fine .
why didn' t you say anything ?
why should i say anything ?
you' re supposed to tell me things like that .
she feels i lack ambition .
you aren' t staying home forever .
the problem is , i don' t know what i want .
i don' t want to be a career lawyer like tonje .
you don' t have to work as a lawyer .
i am a fourth generation supreme court advocate .
i want to write books .
be an author .
so write books .
i' ve already submitted one to a publisher .
but writing isn' t a real job .
is that what tonje says ?
not in words .
hello ?
hi .
now ?
i can be there in ten minutes .
that was the doctor' s office .
my test results are in .
they want me there .
jacob sand is here .
hi .
what is it ?
won' t you have a seat ?
is something wrong ?
jacob ...
you are fine .
there was nothing wrong with your tests .
i' m sorry .
that' s ok .
i just wanted to see you again .
i have the rest of the day off .
want to do something ?
i' d love to .
let' s go in here .
here ?
a karaoke bar ?
want a beer ?
two beers .
i think this one should be good ...
good morning .
sleep well ?
are you already up ?
i have to go shopping .
i need to find a children' s store .
why ?
is that so strange ?
you haven' t asked if i use birth control .
hey ...
are you ... ?
do you know ... ?
isn' t that what you want ?
relax .
a colleague just had a baby .
jacob !
have you ever seen anything so tiny ?
or so expensive ?
it costs a fortune .
don' t you like children ?
why do you ask ?
it doesn' t seem like it .
i' m crazy about kids .
i' m serious .
why wait ?
because we' ve only known eachother for a month .
so ?
i' ve found the man of my life .
i have a good education , a good job , a good income .
now i want a baby .
do we have time to eat first ?
when is a good time ?
more women now use foreign sperm banks to become pregnant .
hello ?
here .
can you baby sit tonight ?
me ?
we' ve been invited to a gala and our babysitter backed out .
i promised to help john get anne' s wedding present .
you are ... were almost her godfather .
i don' t know the first thing about kids .
this is the front , this is the back .
instructions are under her feet .
can' t anyone else ?
i' ve called everyone but the salvation army .
i can call them .
you owe me .
hi .
can you baby sit ?
sure .
come in .
are you sure ?
i' d love to do it my self .
if you have plans , you have plans .
hello ?
yes .
can you hold her for a second ?
i' m on my way .
ten minutes .
i' m sorry .
go .
leave us girls alone .
are you sure it' s all right ?
i won' t be late .
is anything happening ?
don' t scare them .
i' m not .
getting any ?
they' re just eating .
you said they' d go to sleep .
they will .
there' s enough sleeping medicine in that bread to knock out duckburg .
why are you so late ?
you take over .
i' m bored .
can' t we just buy a present ?
you know anne loves duck .
to eat .
she may not want them as pets .
there' s none left .
so knock their heads against a tree .
how are things going , jacob ?
how' s it going with the woman of your life ?
great .
i' ve never been so in love before .
this is the first time ...
what' s going on ?
i don' t know .
hello ?
yoga .
to counteract stress .
veronica , if it gets too bad , you can just marry me .
what' s going on here ?
don' t tell me you' ve hypnotized them to lie like that .
bring the car down to the river .
well done , jacob !
nice of you to show up .
don' t say anything .
it would just sound stupid .
i' m going to bed .
good night .
hi , this is nina bomann .
leave a message after the tone .
nina ?
nina ?
i' m so sorry about what happened yesterday .
it has nothing to do with that , jacob .
please .
what is it ?
this just won' t work .
what won' t work ?
we want different things out of life , jacob .
i want you .
we can have kids .
i' m serious .
i' m having you arrested !
that' il teach you !
have you talked to her ?
are you really in love with her ?
john ...
if you are , it doesn' t matter what she said .
she broke up with me .
those are just words .
words ?
you have to fight !
show her she' s special .
buy a full page ad , buy a flower shop , go on a hunger strike .
do something active .
dare something !
jacob , for the first time in your life you' re in love .
you can' t come in here .
i want to see nina .
she quit last friday .
you expect me to believe that ?
sorry ...
happy ?
did she leave a forwarding address ?
you know that information is confidential .
hello ?
you moved some things for nina bomann .
finally , there you are !
this will be a fun starting point ...
we thought you had changed your mind .
i' m auntie crazy .
don' t take that literally .
what' s your sign ?
virgo .
expect me to believe that ?
well , we have a job to do !
entr !
you can undress over there to the right .
undress ?
we are all too inhibited .
hung up in conventions , in squares .
we have to let go .
we must .
let go !
my first orgasm was incredible .
do you masturbate often ?
you should .
let' s see .
how do you like to pose ?
frontal , or from the rear ?
whatever you prefer .
i' m here to talk to nina .
you' re jacob .
then we want a poem .
recite a poem .
a poem ?
a poem .
let it out .
release the poem , jacob .
about the woman you love .
she' s like a boat on the ocean .
her head is full of notions .
her heart , warm with emotion .
for how things should be .
why are you staring at me ?
this is bullshit !
wait .
is nina here ?
do you know where she is ?
i can' t tell you .
why can' t i talk to her ?
have i done something wrong ?
she' s pregnant .
maybe she needs time to think .
why would she need that ?
maybe the thought of you as a father , frightens her .
she can' t just run away .
i didn' t think you wanted kids .
relax , jacob .
she' il be back .
now it' s anne' s turn to get married .
hurrah !
do you take anne grom to be your lawful partner ?
i do .
do you , anne grom , take marte sundt bull to be your lawful partner ?
i do .
since you have agreed to enter into a partnership ,
i pronounce this partnership lawfully registered .
go ahead .
hi !
how are you doing ?
i' m completely ...
i' m completely out of it .
it' il all work out .
when you come home , i' m sure she' il be back .
what happened with you and me ...
i feel very guilty .
i am so sorry .
it was just as much my fault .
you know that .
who knows ?
maybe i' m finally open for the man of my life .
you deserve it .
this is the craziest wedding i have ever been to .
to you this must be a veritable orgy .
why does everyone say that ?
because you have become a boring , predictable ,
self centered and self righteous cunt of a lawyer !
i' m going to be a mommy .
and i' il be a mother .
next time i' il be mommy .
and i' il be mother .
what about the father ?
i' m sure he' d be as thrilled as us , if he only knew !
she' s a lesbian !
most of the women here are .
nina !
she knew i was a lawyer , asked me about my family ,
had me take tests , checked for diseases ...
that' s why she wanted to test my sperm !
she drained me like a billy goat !
jacob , this is crazy .
she used me like a bull .
i might as well have given it to her in a cup .
i want custody .
takes more than buying clothes .
i can take classes .
you plan to breast feed ?
there is something called infant formula .
jacob ...
what makes you think the baby will be better off with you ?
i don' t want the baby to grow up with a ...
with a mother like that .
ok .
how warm is the formula supposed to be ?
i can learn !
is it supposed to look like that ?
did you think she ate with a knife and fork ?
there you go .
now let' s burp .
come to daddy .
can you hold her ?
is she supposed to smell like this ?
oh no !
that' s the sixth time today .
did you go poopie again ?
hold this .
where are you going ?
to buy diapers .
now ?
if she keeps crying , just thump her on the floor .
no wonder you were so upset .
your diaper was full of poop .
what kind of daddy do you have ?
tonje and i went to see a marriage counselor .
the counselor talked about openness and communication .
what happened ?
what do you think ?
we started arguing .
eventually she left .
tonje ?
no .
the counselor .
then what happened ?
we went home too .
and when we got home things were ... so quiet .
stine was at my mother' s .
it' s crazy .
i hardly recognize her .
she has gone through such a change .
all we do is ...
tonje ?
oh yes !
are you happy now ?
you don' t think i know about that lesbo stuff ?
you' il make a great family !
what are you talking about ?
i' ve seen what you' re up to .
you can' t fool me !
this is petter .
i don' t think you' ve met .
he' s my ex husband .
sell now .
it' s a great opportunity .
you' ve already sold it ?
i told you to wait till it hit 43 !
how are you doing ?
i' m doing fucking great !
i had planned to tell you .
i just needed some time to decide what to do .
you needed some time ?
what about my rights ?
the baby isn' t yours .
can i come in ?
what happened to uniform boy ?
we broke up .
he could never love me .
all i want is a life .
why can' t i get a life ?
why did we break up ?
because you left me .
you made me leave .
i did ?
you did not love me .
sure i did .
you never said so .
and you had stopped touching me .
i didn' t think you wanted me to .
there was nothing i wanted more .
then why did you sleep on the couch ?
dearest jacob ...
if only you knew how much i loved you .
we could have been so happy .
could have had a big family .
what is this ?
i thought i was going to be a dad .
you don' t want children with me ,
but as soon as you meet someone else , you make her pregnant ?
i was tricked .
i thought i was tricked .
oh , jacob ...
you always let yourself be used .
you have to learn to set limits .
we can have children !
turn down that music !
why did you sleep out here ?
i' ve been thinking .
let' s try again .
i can move in , and we can fix up this place together .
it will be fantstico !
this couch ... has to go .
hi .
can we talk ?
i came to apologize .
i had hoped you' d find out some other way .
i' m the one that should apologize .
no .
i should .
if you still think i' m in love with my aunt ...
if i had known i was pregnant ,
i never would have gotten involved with you like that .
i miss you .
are you coming ?
nina ?
nina !
it isn' t what you think .
what is it ?
she' s my ex .
she just became single .
that' s why she' s walking around naked in your apartment ?
what about your ex ?
petter ?
i wouldn' t touch him with a ten foot pole !
we want nothing to do with each other .
we had just signed our divorce papers .
nina ...
there must be something i can do .
i' ve never felt this way before .
we had our chance .
i simply cannot decide .
we don' t have much time .
did you ask about the rising mains ?
she couldn' t find them .
couldn' t find the rising mains ?
don' t yell at me !
she' s the specialist .
have you heard from her , jacob ?
no .
she' s having a baby with another man .
maybe she' il come back to you .
why would she do that ?
because she loves you .
that was beautifully put , veronica .
what ?
what you just said .
that was incredibly beautiful .
will you marry me ?
let' s go .
i know i' m an arrogant bastard , but ...
i love you .
i know .
it' s so obvious .
i must have been blind not to see it .
you' re the woman of my life .
you' re who i dream of .
john ...
veronica , will you marry me ?
will you marry me ?
yes .
of course .
i' ve never understood why women like to look at baby clothes .
but now i think it' s ... great .
why do you think she came to you ?
why did she react like that when she saw maria ?
she wants you back .
i screwed up .
i know when it' s over .
you know nothing .
you love her .
you have to fight .
she wants you to show yourself as the man she hopes you are .
i' m lost .
that' s the problem .
you aren' t .
just don' t give up .
i heard rumors that you hung your lawyer' s robe in the closet .
watch out for the curb .
fredrik and i made a deal .
he can write ,
and i turned down the partnership in my firm .
great .
i thought that was what you wanted .
i wanted more fredrik and he wanted more of me .
did you know he wrote a novel while stine slept ?
of course .
how' s the yoga going ?
i quit .
quit ?
what are you doing now ?
nothing .
it' s enough to share a bottle of wine with john .
the water broke .
get me to the hospital .
now ?
yes .
find a car !
a taxi !
i' il get fredrik .
we don' t have time !
get a taxi !
they won' t stop !
this woman is having a baby .
can you drive her to the nearest clinic ?
i' m a little busy right now .
hurry !
is it real important ?
hurry up , guys .
i hate to be difficult , but ...
go !
can' t you go any faster ?
this is fun !
my day just took a turn for the better .
careful !
can' t you slow down a little ?
try to wait .
i can' t exactly hold it in !
careful with that wreath .
someone' s supposed to mourn over it later .
oh my god !
drive !
i' ve dreamt of doing this for over ten years .
you' re on the sidewalk .
you see him , right ?
i had a whole funeral procession behind me .
i must have lost them .
so what ...
they know where to go .
you' re at the wrong entrance .
good luck .
thanks for the ride .
now i need to find nordberg chapel from here .
where might that be ?
fredrik isn' t answering .
then leave a message !
where are you going ?
i ...
you can' t leave now .
this will go just fine .
breathe deeply , like you did at childbirth class .
come over here .
breathe easy .
and push !
great !
come on .
we' il let you cut the umbilical cord .
come on !
here it is !
