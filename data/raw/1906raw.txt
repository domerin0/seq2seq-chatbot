the customer' s always right .
because when lucy comes through the door ... everybody says , " surprise !
you gotta stop bouncing for a second .
you' il say , " surprise !
can we keep bouncing ?
you' il have to come down .
after lucy gets here and we say , " surprise .
so you have to assume surprise position .
should we rehearse it one more time ?
assume the surprise position .
annie was supposed to warn us .
brad , hit the light .

it' s not her .

put the present there .
you have to hurry , because lucy' s coming .

annie said lucy' s coming up the stairs right now .
so you have to assume the surprise position .
i bet she already knows .
why are you being a party pooper ?
she' s coming now .
you have to assume the surprise position .
don' t touch me .
i' ve got cooties !
it' s contagious !
hey , what are you doing ?
get your hands off him .
what are you doing touching my kid ?
surprise !
leave him alone !
happy birthday .
daddy ?
you don' t have to call him daddy .
she said you' re not her real father anyway .
she said she was adopted .
lucy !
given the fact that the father ... was arrested for solicitation ... couldn' t control his emotions ... endangering other children .
no , you can' t !
it' s her birthday !
ms. calgrove also cites ...
mr. dawson' s mental delays which raise serious questions ... about his ability to properly parent .
run !
i find at this time ... it' s not in the best interest of the child to remain in the home .
and i order her detained ... until a formal jurisdictional hearing .
mr. dawson .
is there anything you' d like to add ?
i wanted to make it a really special surprise party .
so i went , and i got plates at the pic ' n ' save ... in yellow and in pink like a princess .
and then i went to the toy store ... and i got balloons with the helium in them .
mr. dawson ?
yeah .
it sounds like you gave her such a lovely party .
yes , i' m sure it was .
right now , i want to talk to you about your legal rights .
ok .
there' s room at this table ... if anybody wants to sit next to me .

you guys think i' m guilty ?
no , sam .
you didn' t kill anybody .
i miss lucy , sam .
me , too .
you need a personal injury lawyer ... because you have been personally injured .
when dustin hoffman was trying to keep billy ... from going back to meryl streep ... his lawyer told him that it would cost him $15, 000 ... and that' s if we win . $15, 000 !

i wonder if you noticed that , because i noticed that .

i' m sorry , mrs. dawson ... but if i were you , i wouldn' t waste any more of my time .
sorry , mrs. dawson , but i think you should put sam in a home .
sam in a home .
mr. dawson , you do understand ... that since i' m a court appointed psychologist ... the traditional client therapist confidentiality ... will be waived .
do you understand that ?
that the confidentiality will be waived .
good .
let' s begin .
i went to a doctor one time who had an orange office .
all the walls were painted orange .
do you know her ?
she has an orange office ... and she' s in van nuys .
i wanted to ask you about lucy .

she' s six .
she' s seven .
she just had a birthday , i think .

before you read your message ...
press the red button for record .
let' s start with the o. g. m.
what ?
i don' t know .
i don' t think it' s working .
i think it' s because it' s a used machine .
it' s not used .
it' s pre owned .
a guy bought it for his auto shop ... and then he got a secretary .
testing , 1 , 2 , 3 .
that' s a good code .
i can remember that 1 , 2 , 3 .
4 , 5 , 6 .
7 , 8 , 9 .
9 , 10 , 1 1 , 12 .
quick .
you' re recording .
hi .
this is
hi .
this is sam .
i' m not home .
no , you really don' t want to say that ... because you don' t want to tell them you' re not home .
then i' m lying .
everybody' s lying .
sam , you are on the air .
hi .
how are you ?
maybe you sound a little bit too excited .
and maybe you might think about lowering your voice ... so maybe lucy can hear you .
go , sam .
hi , lucy .
thank you for calling me .
that was good .
but did i sound like a good father ?
but it' s an outgoing message ... so i think you need to sound a little more outgoing .
hi .
this is sam .
i' m not ho shoot .
hi .
this is sam !
i think you should sound like a normal person .
from the heart .
from the heart .
this is hello .
thank you for calling .
this is sam .
wow .
i feel that was a very touching moment right there .
i felt that one .
high five .
we have a lot to go over , and i have five minutes .
rothman , glenn , harrison , williams ... is on the 29th floor .
that' s 29 floors up ... and the elevators are actually over there .
keep up .
got to do my cardio .
120 .
got to get to 125 to make it count .
i need that list of names from you ... people who can testify that you' re a good father ... despite your handicap .
just my husband .
i didn' t mean your handicap .
i meant your disability .
the fact that you' re retarded that' s not the right word .
i don' t know what to call you .
sam .
you can call me sam .
all right !
hello .
hi , todd .
i was out of range .
how you doing ?
what do you mean , what' s that supposed to mean ?
you' re supposed to be taking him to karate .
are you eating ?
no , i will not hold on .
go pick him up .
i can' t hear you .
i' m in the car .
they put you through to me .
i' m losing you .
what makes sam a good father ?
the important thing is for sam to be a very good father ... is to be there for her ... because the smarter lucy is , the smarter she will get .
so what makes sam a good father ?
lucy' s first word was " annie ... " and her fifth word was " joe .
and i' m joe .
sam is a very good father ... because he likes green things ...
like i like green things very much .
i like green peas .
my cousin luke works for the organization environmental organization greenpeace ... and they like to save the whales .
i like whales .
moby dick " was one of my all time favorite classics ... by herman melville .
wait .
why are you recording this ?
it' s often necessary
you didn' t say anything about a tape recorder .
who' s listening ?
me .
what is that supposed to mean ?
nothing .
who are you really ?
i need to speak to my lawyer now .
i don' t think you realize what you' re up against .
we have to be in court in three days ... and we don' t have a decent witness .
now , you' ve got to know someone who can testify ... who' s been to college ... or has a degree of some kind ... or has some way of expressing themselves ... that will make the court believe you deserve ... to get your daughter back .
i need coffee .
big , tall .
tall is the smallest .
yeah , of course .
once you think of this person ... and there has to be one person , call me at work .
because i' m going back there now ... to my seven other cases .
what ?
mrs. robeck .
i' m on the 405 .
the traffic is horrible .
you want this for here or to go ?
dorothy ?
oh , no .
no .
tow truck is towing your car .
son of a bitch .
it' s towing your car .
no , wait !
stop !
it' s my car .
stop .
but , annie , it' s just one day .
and lucy needs you because you went to college ... and you can give the right answers .
and we can' t lose her .
i' d make it worse for you .
i can' t do it .
don' t you think i would if i could ?
all rise for the honorable judge phillip mcneilly .
hi , guys .
hi , sam .
boy , you did a wonderful job making those signs .
you' re welcome , sam .
good luck , buddy .
go get ' em .
although , at her birthday party ...
i believe her true feelings about her father were revealed .
objection .
true feelings revealed " ?
your honor , ms. davis is an expert ... appointed by the court for her opinion .
i' il allow it .
then every child who rages ... because they didn' t get to stay up ... that extra hour to watch tv
any child who said they hated their parents ... because they didn' t want a bath ... would be a prime candidate for foster care ?
objection , your honor .
sustained .
i think they want you to stop .
really ?
thank you , sam .
yeah , ok .
brad' s wearing a tie today ... and i think the tie looks wonderful on you , brad .
you look great , too .
there' s a lady she' s writing everything down .
watch what you say .
i have the best friends in the whole world .
continue with your witness , mr. turner .
ms. davis , i assume in your therapy session ... that mr. dawson extolled his parenting ability .
on the contrary .
mr. dawson admitted he felt very confused at times .
actually , that he felt terrified ... that he' d made and would continue to make and i can quote here
huge mistakes , huge mistakes ...
mistakes that are huge .
thank you .
no further questions .
you' re a mother , aren' t you , ms. davis ?
yes , i am .
would it be fair to say that ... as a parent , you' ve been confused from time to time ... possibly overwhelmed on occasion ... even though you' re a wonderful mother ?
if ms. davis has never had a moment ... where she' s been confused as a mother ... it would bias her expert opinion .
i know that i have many moments as a parent ... where i felt i' ve made huge mistakes .
objection .
get to the relevant point , ms. harrison .
the point is , you' ve never had those moments ... have you , ms. davis ?
moments that every parent i' ve ever spoken to has .
moments where the task is so unbelievably challenging ... that you feel retarded ... disabled in some way .
moments where everyone seems to have the key but you .
really , to be honest
yes or no ?
please answer the question .
i didn' t really feel right now
let me rephrase the question .
when your son o. d. ' d  objection .
if ms. davis didn' t feel she had made mistakes ... mistakes that were huge ... it might bias her opinion toward mr. dawson .
i' il allow it .
ms. davis , when your son o. d. ' d ... did you feel that you might have made mistakes ... mistakes that were huge ?
yes .
yes .
no further questions .
you made her cry .
i got lucky .
oh , no .
that' s not nice to make her cry .
only in there .
and your secretary when you hated your desk .
green and yellow on the same plate .
could you separate the lima beans ... from the corn , please ?
sam , don' t be impossible .
can i have the spinach omelette only egg whites , no fat , no oil , no butter .
and extra mushrooms ?
absolutely .
my treat .
no , no , no  my treat .
my pro bono .
that means she doesn' t have to pay .
i pay .
sam , do you really want to get this ... or are you just trying to ... trying to act like a ...
what do you mean ?
you know , like never mind .
i' m a grownup .
i didn' t say that .
you think what they think .
you' re my lawyer , and you think what they think ?
i don' t have a chance .
i think ... you deserve a fair trial .
do you think what they think ?
sam can' t order food or sam can' t pay a check .
sam can' t take care of lucy ?
it doesn' t matter what i think .
it matters that we win .
it matters what you think .
it doesn' t matter to them what i think .
it matters to me !
it matters to me !
