you know the chief' s gonna kill us , right ?
let me give you guys a little tip .
lf you' re going to operate outside the channels ... do the whole renegade cop thing ... you might want to make sure that you get the right guy .
chief , we almost had the guy .
our intelligence was just a little off .
wait a minute . lntelligence ?
look around you , copeland .
there' s nothing intelligent about this .
now i' m tired of your escapades .
i want them to stop .
the last thing i need is to be the laughingstock of the bureau .
and furthermore , the
hold on .
hello ?
baby , i can' t talk .
the chief is chewing my ass right now .
i got to call you back .

sorry , chief .

it' s for you .

baby , i' m still with the chief .

thanks , chief .
you guys are ....

i expect to have a full report on my desk tomorrow .
yes , sir .
and in the meantime ...
i' m checking with the bureau to see if they got any openings ... in lraq .
the dynamic duo strikes again .

hag and dazs .

adis , dazs .

okay , so , you do the floor .
clean all the ice cream up and i' il go warm the car up .
okay .
so much for a hot meal .
hey , baby .
don' t " hey , baby " me .
i can' t believe you have me sitting here all night worried about you .
all night ?
baby ... it' s only 8 : 00 .
look , after work , me and kevin went down to the bar and had a couple of drinks .
i know .
i called the bar .
they said you left at 7 : 45 .
i checked mapquest .
it only takes six minutes to get there from here .
so , if you got somebody on the side , you need to tell me .
baby , listen to what you just say .
mapquest said it takes six minutes to get here .
i got here in eight .
which means there' s two minutes unaccounted for .
lf i was cheating on you , don' t you think i' d need more than two minutes ?
you know what ?
i ain' t going to deal with this .
i' m tired , okay ?
i had a long day at work .
i got shot at .
see , that is exactly what i' m talking about .
we don' t communicate .
okay , fine .
you want to communicate ?
yes .
come on .
let' s communicate .
okay ?
okay .
let' s start with last week .
last week .
you and i were supposed to go shopping together .
we get to the mall .
i buy this beautiful dress , i get my hair done .
you don' t say anything .
i don' t know , maybe you just don' t want to ....
did you hear me just now ?
tell me what i said .
i heard everything .
you was communicating .
don' t play with me right now .
i am not in the mood .
i cannot believe you came home late and then you start ....
marcus !
you are falling asleep again .
i am talking to you .
i wasn' t asleep , i was closing my eyes and visualizing your words .
oh , really ?
visualizing ?
why don' t you paint me a picture of what i just said ?
hold on .
you know why ?
because you are falling asleep again .
marcus !
we received this from mr. andrew wilson , ceo of wilson cruise lines .
it was delivered to his home .
the girls in the photo are his daughters ... and heiresses to the wilson fortune .
we believe they are the kidnapper' s next victims .
mr. wilson has given us permission to shadow his daughters .
we' re going to set up surveillance ... and if the kidnapper strikes ... this time we will be ready .
now , the wilson sisters will be flying into jfk this morning .
so who' s going to pick them up ?
obviously , everyone has read the profile on the girls .
still , somebody' s got to do it .
i don' t think this is a good idea .
i don' t care .
we deserve to be on this case just as much as gomez and harper .
i know , but we don' t want to interrupt the man in a briefing .
well , somebody got to stand up to him .
chief .
what ?
marcus has something he want to tell you .
what ?
chief , we just want to know if we could get on the case .
you' re on .
the boys over at lntel seem to think that the kidnapper' s a guy ... named ted burton .
it says burton was a partner of wilson' s ... and some other associates in some business venture that failed .
says he spent time in the federal pen and lost his fortune .
guy' s been mla since his release and those dates coincide with the first kidnappings .
what do you think ?
i think this babysitting gig sucks .
dude , relax .
look , man .
all we got to do is pick these chicks up ... drop their ass off in the hamptons , then we back in the chief' s good graces .
i didn' t join the fbl to become a nanny .
i want to be on the street where the action is .
okay , blackie chan , and you' il get there .
can we just do this first , please ?
all right .
you didn' t put dairy in this , did you ?
no .
because you know i' m lactose intolerant .
last time , i barely made it to the bathroom .
why would i want to disturb your stomach ?
there goes your girls .
come on , man .
let' s do this .
hi , i' m kevin copeland .
this is  we already gave to the united negro fund .
wait .
hold on .
excuse us .
we' re actually here to escort you ladies to the hamptons .
the bags are on the plane .
take baby and clean out his bag .
he didn' t have his colonic and he like pooped everywhere .
what' s this ?
baby got to ride in the car seat .
where the hell am i supposed to sit ?
this ain' t right .
man , you guys sure got a lot of bags for a weekend .
this isn' t a weekend .
it' s the weekend .
labor day in the hamptons .
the last weekend of the social season .
only the hottest people are going to be there .
and only the hottest of the hottest are going to make it onto the cover ... of hamptons magazine .

you spend all day trying to find the perfect outfit .

a little cushion for the pushing .
i' d really love for you to come to one of my games .
no , thank you .
i' ve seen you play .
not impressed .
excuse me ?
i' m the highest scoring forward in the league !
but all that talent ?
totally overshadowed by nothing but scandals and pure laziness .
come on !
you' re shooting under 50 % from the free throw line , okay ?
your turnover ratio , abysmal .
and on top of that , you can' t shoot three pointers to save your life .
so ... squeeze me .
no one' s ever cared like that before .
come here , baby !
oopsie !
i had a poopsie .
girl , we' re going to get along just fine .

i jump over the fence , fall .
i scrape my knee .
get out of here .
no , seriously , listen .
i scrape my knee .
i get chased by the cops and i spend the night in jail .
that' s insane .
you did all that just to find j lo and ben' s hideaway ?
i can' t help it .
you know , investigative journalism is my passion .
so how' d you end up writing puff pieces for the local news ?
unfortunately , i made some enemies ... and ended up getting fired from my last job .
what happened ?
believe me , you don' t want to know about that .
look , i spent all night talking about myself .
sometimes it' s good for a man to just sit back and listen .
well , since you put it that way .
i did this piece on warren vandergeld .
him and his partners tried to swindle a guy .
you talking about ted burton ?
yeah , how did you know that ?
it was in the paper .
i read about it .
but what they didn' t report in the paper ... was that burton was 10 times smarter than all of them .
he embezzled millions and stashed it in an offshore account .
when vandergeld heard the story was going to break ... he didn' t want to be embarrassed .
well , there goes my job .
you know , you' re a good listener .
it seems like you have the whole package .
man !
hello ?
kev , you got to go .
what ?
now ?
yeah , now .
we' re on our way .
can' t you stall him for a little while ?
look , this man sang to me .

i wonder ... if he would think she was so hot ... if he knew that she is broke .
vandergeld' s broke ?
we mustn' t talk of such things .
no , we won' t .
but , yes , they' re broke .
my father even had to loan her father money ... just so that they could keep their house .
they just paid us back .

making my way downtown walking fast
