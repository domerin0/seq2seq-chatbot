the dual substance of christ the yearning , so human , so superhuman , of man to attain god ... has always been a deep inscrutable mystery to me .
my principle anguish and source of all my joys and sorrows from my youth onward has been the incessant , merciless battle between the spirit and the flesh ... and my soul is the arena where these two armies have clashed and met .
nlkos kazantzakls
from the book " the last temptation of christ
this film is not based upon the gospels but upon this fictional exploration of the eternal spiritual conflict .
the last temptatlon of chrlst
the feeling begins .
very tender , very loving .
then the pain starts .
claws slip underneath the skin and tear their way up ... ... just before they reach my eyes , they dig in .
and i remember .
first i fasted for three months .
i even whipped myself before i went to sleep .
at first it worked .
then the pain came back .
and the voices .
they call me by name .
jesus .
who is it ?
who are you ?
why are you following me ?
are you ready ?
no more crosses .
we' re ready .
where is your mind ?
do you hear what i' m saying ?
the messiah won' t come that way .
what do you mean by that ?
who told you ?
you' re a disgrace !
romans can' t find anyone to make crosses , except for you !
you do it !
you' re worse than them !
you' re a jew killing jews .
you' re a coward !
how will you ever pay for your sins ?
with my life , judas .
i don' t have anything else .
don' t turn away .
look at me .
with your life .
what do you mean ?
please , judas .
i don' t know .
are you still taking the cross ?
yes , i am .
no , you' re not .
i won' t let you !
i won' t let you .
please , i beg you , don' t get in the way .
what way ?
what' s happened to you ?
i' m struggling .
with who ?
i don' t know .
i' m struggling .
i struggle .
you collaborate .
traitor !
you are the people of israel .
your children are watching .
you are the people of god .
he is judging us .
he is watching you .
there he is .
kill him !
don' t touch him .
get away from him !
don' t you defend him .
he' s my son .
god is with us .
he' s judging us .
fight !
god help us !
god give us strength !
come .
come with me .
this man , naked before you now , is condemned for sedition ... " ... for lifting his hand against rome .
sedltio
he rallied the people to revolution .
he promised that a messiah would come from among the people ...
... to rise up and destroy rome .
rome is nothing .
murder ...
... betrayal ...
... looting and so on , and so therefore , he is condemned to die .
rome condemns him .
and all the gods of rome condemn him .
god is our shield .
he is our shield .
he is our heart .
he is our heart .
he is our shield .
he is our shield .
he will not abandon you .
he will not abandon you .
god !
god loves me , i know he loves me .
i want him to stop .
i can' t take the pain .
the voices and the pain .
i want him to hate me .
i fight him .
i make crosses so he' il hate me .
i want him to find somebody else .
i want to crucify every one of his messiahs .
you' re sure it' s god ?
you' re sure it' s not the devil ?
i' m not sure .
i' m not sure of anything .
lf it' s the devil , the devil can be cast out .
but what if it' s god ?
you can' t cast out god , can you ?
who' s that ?
who' s following me ?
is that you ?
magdalene .
magdalene .
thank you , lord ... ... for bringing me where i did not want to go .
he must be one of god' s angels .
he came down to show me the way .
who' s out there ?
who is it ?
what are you doing here ?
i want you to forgive me .
i' ve done too many bad things .
i' m going to the desert , and i need you to forgive me ... ... before i go , please .
i see .
you sit out there all day with the others ... ... and then come in here with your head down , saying , " forgive me .
forgive me .
it' s not that easy .
just because you need forgiveness , don' t ask me to do it .
i' m sorry get out !
go away !
look , mary ... ... look at this .
god can change this .
god can save your soul .
he already broke my heart , he took you away from me .
and i hate both of you .
hate me , blame me .
it' s all my fault , but not god' s .
don' t say that about god .
who made me feel this way about god ?
i know , that' s why i' m here .
it' s why i want you to forgive me .
i' il pay my debt .
i know ... ... there are some things i' ve done , and to you .
pay or go away .
don' t you remember ?
no , i don' t remember .
why should i ?
nothing' s changed .
say the truth .
if you want to save my soul ... ... this is where you' il find it .
you know that .
you' re the same as all the others , only you can' t admit it .
you' re pitiful .
i hate you .
here' s my body .
save it .
save it .
is that the way you show you' re a man ?
turn away , don' t look at me .
you never had the courage to be a man .
don' t look at me !
if you weren' t hanging on to your mother , you were hanging on to me .
now you' re hanging on to god ... ... going to the desert to hide because you' re scared .
go .
whenever i see you , my heart breaks .
i do remember when we were children .
never have i felt so much tenderness toward anyone ... ... as i felt toward you then .
all i ever wanted was you .
nothing else .
what do you think i wanted ?
please .
stay .
is it so bad sharing a prostitute' s room ?
i won' t touch you .
you' il still be a virgin for the desert .
mary , i' m sorry .
i can' t stay .
welcome .
this way .
do you always pray this late at night ?
it' s a funeral .
the master of the monastery died .
shall i pray with you ?
sleep .
you must be tired .
i know who you are .
that was the man who brought me here last night .
last night ?
he was dead last night .
the master' s soul has gone to heaven .
his body' s work is completed .
it walked under the sun and the moon ... ... over sand and stone ... ... sinned , felt pain ... ... yearned for heaven .
we commend his remains to our god .
flesh ... ... the master no longer needs you .
melt away .
first came the wings , then the angel .
his spirit actually appeared to you .
he treated you like a royal visitor .
he recognized you for something .
he couldn' t have recognized me for anything .
i only came here to serve god .
that' s all .
that' s all god wants from me .
i' m sure of it .
think of how you' re blessed .
god actually makes himself known to you .
i don' t know what god wants from me .
all my life i' ve wanted to hear god' s voice .
i' ve dedicated my life to him .
sometimes ... ... i think i feel him , but i' m never really sure .
but you always know .
god took you by the hand and brought you here .
you think it' s a blessing to know what god wants ?
i' il tell you what he wants .
he wants to push me over !
can' t he see what' s inside of me ?
all my sins .
we all sin .
not my sins .
i' m a liar .
a hypocrite .
i' m afraid of everything .
i don' t tell the truth .
i don' t have the courage .
when i see a woman , i blush and look away .
i want her , but i don' t take her , for god , and that makes me proud .
then my pride ruins magdalene .
i don' t steal , i don' t fight ... ... i don' t kill .
not because i don' t want to , but because i' m afraid .
i want to rebel against you , against everything ... ... against god , but ... ... l' m afraid .
you want to know who my mother and father are ?
you want to know who my god is ?
fear .
you look inside me and that' s all you' il find .
but the more devils we have inside of us , the more of a chance we have to repent .
lucifer is inside me .
he says to me , " you' re not the son of king david .
you' re not a man , you' re the son of man .
and more , the son of god .
and more than that , god .
do you want to ask me anything else ?
everything is from god .
everything has two meanings .
jesus , my sweet jesus .
i forgive you .
leave me !
they' ve gone .
you have to leave , too .
no , i have to stay .
no .
you' ve been purified .
god has just blessed you .
the snakes came from inside you .
now you have to leave , too .
you have to go back ... ... and speak to people and share your heart .
speak to who ?
to anyone who will listen .
and say what ?
just open your mouth .
do you love mankind ?
i see men and i feel sorry for them , that' s all .
that' s enough .
i' ve got orders to kill you .
go ahead .
tonight i was purified .
i can' t fight with god anymore .
here' s my neck .
cut it , i' m ready .
what are you ?
what kind of a man are you ?
what you want , i want .
that' s why he brought us together , it' s god' s plan .
i come to kill you and you help me , that' s god' s plan ?
these voices you hear , it' s god' s voice ?
only you understand it ?
you' d better make me understand it , too .
i' il tell you as much as i know .
the fainting spells , the voices , the visions .
power .
magic .
is there some secret ?
tell me your secret .
pity .
pity for who ?
yourself ?
pity for men .
our enemies are men .
i feel pity for everything .
donkeys ... ... grass , sparrows .
and ants ?
you feel pity for them , too ?
yes .
everything' s a part of god .
when i see an ant , when i look at his shiny black eye ... ... you know what i see ?
i see the face of god .
you' re not afraid of dying ?
why should i be ?
death isn' t a door that closes , it opens .
it opens and you go through it .
if i don' t kill you , what happens ?
i' il speak to people .
what are you going to say ?
i' il just open my mouth and god will do the talking .
maybe god didn' t send you here to kill me .
maybe he sent you here to follow me .
just so there' s no mistake .
i' il go with you until i understand .
but if you stray this much ... ... from the path , i' il kill you .
it' s magdalene .
she deserves it .
get out of there .
get out of the way !
this is not your business .
do you want to get hurt ?
did you hear what he said , idiot ?
move !
no .
i don' t want this .
listen to him .
he doesn' t want this .
well , we want it .
why ?
we don' t have to tell you why !
i' ve had enough .
we live in a whorehouse .
she' s a jew .
she works on the sabbath .
she goes with romans on the sabbath .
she broke moses ' law .
she dies .
who has never sinned ?
who ?
which one of you people has never sinned ?
whoever that is , come up here !
and throw these !
i have nothing to hide .
good .
take this .
it' s bigger .
be careful , zebedee .
there is a god .
he' s seen you cheat your workers .
he' s seen you with that widow , what' s her name ?
judith .
judith .
aren' t you afraid god will paralyze you if you lift that stone ?
that your arm will wither ?
that you' il lose all strength ?
god has so many miracles .
what if i say the wrong thing ?
what if i say the right thing ?
come closer .
come closer !
we' re all a family .
come closer , so you can hear .
i have something to tell you .
who is he ?
it' s jesus from nazareth .
nothing good can come out of nazareth , even the scriptures say so .
i' m sorry , but ... ... the easiest way to make myself clear ... ... is to tell you a story .
a farmer was planting in his field .
some seed fell on the ground and the birds ate it .
some seed fell on rocks and dried up .
but some seed ...
some seed fell on rich soil ... ... and grew into enough wheat to feed a whole nation .
can you hear me ?
we can hear you fine .
i' m the farmer .
the farmer is me .
and 2 and 2 makes 4 .
another lunatic !
rabbi ... ... tell me , if you' re the farmer ... ... and we' re the stones , what' s the seed ?
what' s the seed ?
love .
love one another .
that' s easy to say , maybe that' s good advice , but for some other world .
these people are starving .
first you feed them , then you talk !
i used to think god was angry , too , but not anymore !
he used to jump on me like a wild bird and dig his claws into my head .
but then one morning , he came to me .
he blew over me like a cool breeze and said , " stand up .
and here i am .
and you will go to hell .
these are children' s stories .
how can they help us ?
what are you hungry for ?
what are you thirsty for ?
for justice !
and bread !
bread , too .
you' re thirsty for justice , for people to treat you fairly ... ... for people to treat you with respect .
what i' m telling you is ... ... whoever' s hungry for justice , they are the ones who' il be blessed .
they' il be filled with bread .
they' il never be hungry again .
they' il have the real value , the value of love .
to love , share and comfort .
they' il have the courage to do the good .
and you .
you' re mourning .
mourners will be blessed .
you' il have god to comfort you .
you won' t need men to do it .
and the meek .
they' re the ones who' il be blessed .
and the suffering , they' il be blessed , too .
and the peacemakers and the merciful ... ... and the sick , and the poor , and the outcasts ... ... you' il all be blessed because heaven is yours !
and believe me ...
... believe me , those who are laughing now ... ... will be crying later .
those whose stomachs are filled now will be hungry later .
and the rich will be poor forever !
kill them !
i didn' t say death !
i said love !
i said love !
enough .
come .
no , father , i' m staying .
we have to work .
i need you !
come .
i' m sorry , father , i' m staying , too .
not the two of you .
come on !
let me come with you , i can help .
stay here .
you' il know when .
tell people about me .
james .
andrew .
move over , john .
move over , james .
i was just comfortable .
peter wants to lay down .
peter , there' s no more room .
i' m cold .
i want to be by the fire .
go over by philip .
we' re all cold .
shut up .
rabbi , can i talk to you ?
i' m not like these other men .
i mean , they' re good enough , they' re good men .
but they' re weak .
one' s worse than the other .
where' d you find them ?
look at me .
if i love somebody , i would die for them .
if i hate somebody , i' d kill them .
i could even kill somebody i loved if they did the wrong thing .
did you hear me ?
do you understand what i said ?
yes , i understand .
the other day you said , if a man hit you , you' d turn the other cheek .
i didn' t like that .
only an angel could do that , or a dog .
i' m sorry but i' m neither .
i' m a free man .
i don' t turn my cheek to anyone .
we both want the same thing .
we do ?
do you want freedom for israel ?
no .
i want freedom for the soul .
no .
that' s what i can' t accept .
that' s not the same thing !
first you free the body , then the spirit !
the romans come first .
you don' t build a house from the roof down but from the foundation up .
the foundation is the soul .
the foundation is the body .
that' s where you must begin .
if you don' t change the spirit first , change what' s inside ... ... then you' il only replace the romans with someone else , and nothing changes .
even if you' re victorious , you' il still be filled with the poison .
you' ve got to break the chain of evil .
how do you change then ?
with love .
who' s there ?
it' s me , andrew .
is everything ...
it' s all right .
go back to sleep .
judas and i are talking .
there' s an example .
you know , the zealots ordered me to kill you .
why did you change your mind ?
i decided to wait .
for what ?
i thought maybe you were the one .
to unite us .
i didn' t want to destroy that .
how do we know ?
how could i be the messiah ?
when those people were torturing magdalene , i wanted to kill them .
and then i opened my mouth ... ... and out comes the word " love .
why ?
i don' t understand .
i can' t look to the others for answers , all they do is follow you .
we' il go to judea and see john the baptist .
every day he tells hundreds of people the messiah is coming .
he' il know .
he' il know .
i' m afraid .
stay with me .
behold !
i will raise up evil against you out of your own house ... ... and i will take your wives , before your eyes ... ... and give them to your neighbor , and he shall lie with your wives ... ... in the sight of this sun .
you may listen and listen again ... ... but you will never understand .
you may look , but you will never know .
these people' s wits are dulled .
their ears are deafened and their eyes blinded ... ... so they cannot see with their eyes , nor hear with their ears ... ... so that they may turn and be healed .
on this day ...
he sounds like the messiah .
no . " ... i will crush the horns of the new moon and i will spill darkness over the world .
i will reverse your laughter , turn it into tears ...
go in front .
let him see you .
listen , it is the thunder of many peoples ...
even from behind , i knew i had seen him before .
where ?
was it a dream ?
yes , it was .
but in the dream , he was dressed in white .
you will have the smell of decay ...
... and branding , instead of beauty .
your men shall fall by the sword ...
... and your women shall sit on the ground , stripped bare .
who are you ?
do you recognize me ?
who are you ?
do you know the prophets ?
what does isaiah say ?
he says , " prepare the way of the lord .
are you telling me that' s you ?
i don' t know .
tell me .
why are you here ?
to be baptized .
no , i don' t dare .
if you' re the master , then you have to baptize me .
baptize me .
love .
what does it mean ?
love is sweet as honey .
but it' s also blood .
love is action .
you want a new crop , you burn the earth .
but isn' t love enough ?
no !
look at the world .
look around you .
plague , war , corruption ... ... false prophets , false idols , worship of gold .
nothing is of value .
the tree is rotten .
you have to take the axe and cut it down .
if i was a woodcutter , i' d cut .
if i was a fire , i' d burn .
but i' m a heart and i love and that' s all i can do .
i' m a heart , also .
but i can' t love what' s unjust .
what i can' t love , i attack .
god demands it .
anger ?
yes , god demands anger .
anger ?
but we' re all brothers .
you think love is god' s only way ?
go to the dead sea , look in the bottom .
you' il see two whores , sodom and gomorrah .
that' s god' s way .
on the day of the lord ... ... blood will flow from wood .
the stones of the houses will come alive and kill their owners .
that day is here .
he gave me the axe .
now i give it to you .
that' s not the answer .
then what is the answer ?
i don' t know .
well , if you won' t listen to me , who will you listen to ?
god .
the god of israel is the god of the desert .
if you want to speak to him , then you' il have to go to the desert .
i' il go to idumaea .
thank you , baptist .
be careful .
god isn' t alone out there .
i feel sorry for you .
you were lonely .
you cried .
so i came .
i didn' t call for you .
who are you ?
your spirit .
my spirit ?
you' re afraid of being alone .
you' re just like adam .
he called me and i took one of his ribs ... ... and made it into a woman .
you' re here to trick me .
trick you ?
to love and care for a woman , to have a family , is this a trick ?
why are you trying to save the world ?
aren' t your own sins enough for you ?
what arrogance to think you can save the world .
the world doesn' t have to be saved .
save yourself .
find love .
i have love .
look ... ... in my eyes .
look at my breasts .
do you recognize them ?
just nod your head ... ... and we' il be in my bed together .
jesus .
after ten days ... ... the hunger went away .
welcome , jesus .
congratulations .
you' re past the small temptations of a woman and a family .
we' re both bigger than that .
who are you ?
you don' t recognize me ?
i' m you , i' m your heart .
your heart is so greedy .
it pretends to be humble ... ... but it really wants to conquer the world .
i never wanted a kingdom on earth .
the kingdom of heaven is enough .
you' re a liar .
when you were making crosses for the romans ... ... your head was exploding with dreams of power .
power over everyone .
you said it was god , but you really wanted power .
now you can have what you want .
any country you want .
all of them .
you could even have rome .
liar .
step into my circle so i can pull your tongue out .
archangel , move back .
move back , you' re blinding me .
jesus .
i' m the one you' ve been waiting for .
make me a god , god .
god .
god , make me a god .
but i was just a child then .
you are god .
the baptist knew it .
now it' s time you admit it .
you are his son .
the only son of god .
join me .
together we' il rule the living and the dead .
you' il give life and you' il take life .
you' il sit in judgement , and i' il sit next to you .
imagine how strong we' d be together .
satan ?
we' il see each other again .
don' t be afraid .
you are the one .
my work is done .
now i can die .
the lord wants me to tell you to stand up .
his day is here .
take this axe .
take this message to everyone .
please .
what do you want ?
i' m a foreigner .
from galilee .
i' m tired .
you don' t know how good this tastes .
some more wine , please .
mary ... ... martha ... ... i want to say that you' re both blessed .
i came here , you didn' t know me .
you took me in , fed me , restored me ... ... and god came down and went into my heart .
go on .
no .
i' ve talked too much already .
silence is better .
no , it' s not .
do you have a wife ?
no .
how can you live like that in the desert ?
tell me the truth .
don' t you miss all this ?
having a home , a real life .
i admit it .
i' d like it , but i' il never have it .
listen , if you really want god , don' t spend your time in the desert .
he' s not there , he' s right here .
read your scriptures .
god does not want you to fast and pray .
he wants you to make children .
mary , you' re making him uncomfortable .
he' s a guest .
he knows what i' m talking about .
come and help me .
it' s not right to tease these men .
i wasn' t teasing .
remember the baptist ?
it' s nothing to tease about .
the baptist ?
what ?
he' s dead .
he was killed by herod .
you didn' t know ?
they say the king was drunk and cut off the baptist' s head to satisfy him .
now they say they' re going to kill everyone who was baptized .
no one forced you to be baptized .
you were baptized , too .
you begged for it .
so be quiet .
i can just imagine in galilee right now .
the sea .
they say the fishing' s so good you just touch the nets and the fish jump in .
don' t talk about fish .
it reminds me of my sheep .
i don' t know what' s happened to them .
maybe we should wait for him in galilee .
no , we promised the master we would wait here .
that was over a month ago .
thousands of people are waiting to see and to hear him and he' s gone .
the whole movement .
we look like fools .
nathaniel' s right .
he makes sense .
let' s return to galilee .
if we go back to galilee , like peter says ...
brothers !
i don' t understand you .
think of the last words the baptist said .
he said , " jesus of nazareth , leave the desert .
i am finished .
you return to mankind .
how do we know he really said that ?
everybody says he did .
but how do we know ?
even if he didn' t , the words are important .
why ?
because people believe them .
and what if our master' s ...
what if he' s the one ?
what " one " ?
the one .
what do you mean ?
the messiah ?
we don' t know the baptist said that .
nobody knows .
he' s not like elijah .
he' s saying that the world of god is here now .
he just meant , " continue my work .
continue to do the work i' ve been doing .
right here elijah ascended to heaven .
doesn' t that mean something to you ?
we' re waiting here .
we' re waiting here .
i don' t think we should go back to galilee .
i think we should wait here .
that' s what i love about you , peter .
you' re as steady and as solid as a rock .
nobody can change your mind .
what good are you ?
master .
rabbi .
john heard your footsteps in his heart ... ... in a way , and we were preparing to welcome you .
were you baptized ?
yes .
john baptized with water and they killed him .
now i baptize with fire .
is that what the baptist told you ?
i have an invitation for you .
is there a celebration ?
no .
i' m not inviting you to a celebration .
i' m inviting you to a war .
this is my heart .
take it .
god is inside of us .
the devil is outside us , in the world all around us .
we' il pick up an axe and cut the devil' s throat .
we' il fight him wherever he is .
in the sick ... ... in the rich ... ... even in the temple .
i' il lead you .
if you have sheep ... ... give them away .
if you have a family ... ... leave them .
i believed in love .
now i believe in this !
who' s with me ?
adonai .
today and tomorrow i cast out devils and work cures .
on the third day ... ...
i shall be perfected .
out !
satan , leave !
satan , out !
leave him !
moses , elijah , isaiah ... ... touch my mouth ... ... touch my lips .
go to the temple .
let the high priests see you .
look !
he was blind and jesus healed him .
look .
he was blind and jesus healed him .
look .
you don' t belong at a wedding .
we' re here to celebrate purity .
i' m sorry , but these people are my guests .
let me explain something to you .
what do you think heaven' s like ?
it' s like a wedding .
god' s the bridegroom and man' s spirit' s the bride .
the wedding takes place in heaven ... ... and everyone' s invited .
god' s world is big enough for everyone .
nazarene , that' s against the law .
then the law' s against my heart .
don' t touch me .
you are now sacred to me ... ... through this ring .
you are now sacred to me , through this ring .
according to the law of moses and israel .
according to the law of moses and israel .
my cousins are very upset .
they only brought enough wine for 3 days .
now another day' s gone past and it' s gone .
what' s in those ?
water .
no .
it' s wine .
no , it' s water .
i put it there myself .
it' s wine .
it' s water .
go over there and make sure .
do it .
you' re right .
it is wine .
brothers !
my old friends !
listen to me .
it' s me the prophets preached about .
god talked to me in the desert .
he gave me a secret and told me to bring it to you .
didn' t you hear me coming ?
i ran here to nazareth , where i grew up , to bring you the news .
the world of god is here now .
you work miracles .
make a miracle for us .
make us believe in you .
otherwise go away .
the messiah doesn' t need miracles .
he is the miracle .
now he' s here .
are you ready for me ?
i' m here to tear down everything around you .
you know what i' il replace it with ?
something new .
god .
the world of god .
so take your bread and give it to the poor .
what difference does it make what you own ?
you have gold and silver .
it' s going to rot .
that rot is going to eat away your hearts .
all of you !
there will be a flood and a fire .
everything will be destroyed .
but there will be a new ark riding on that fire !
and i hold the keys and i open the door .
and i decide who goes in and who doesn' t .
you' re my brothers from nazareth and you' re the first i invite on the ark .
don' t wait .
don' t waste your life .
come with me .
you' re the son of mary , right ?
who are you to tell us about god ?
he made better crosses than speeches .
go get someone from his family to take him away .
he' s insane .
what are you laughing at ?
everything you have will burn .
soon !
get out now !
come with me to jerusalem !
see ?
this is what happens when a man doesn' t get married .
the semen backs up into his brain .
go home !
you' re a demon .
you' re possessed .
you' re a lunatic !
this is my home !
you should be ashamed .
kill him !
he' s going to burn us .
don' t touch him !
if i could touch every stone ... ... if i could breathe on every branch , they' d get up and follow me !
so what' s wrong with you ?
come with me to jerusalem !
jerusalem is falling !
i feel it .
i know it .
you see these people ?
they' re poor .
they' re blind .
they' re crippled .
they' re going to be our army .
we' re going to need better men than this .
god will give them to me .
we' re going to build a new jerusalem .
son .
come back with me .
please .
who are you ?
your mother .
i don' t have a mother .
i don' t have any family .
i have a father , in heaven .
don' t say that to me .
who are you ?
i mean , really .
who are you ?
why are you crying ?
didn' t you see them ?
what ?
when he spoke to you , there were thousands of blue wings behind him .
i swear to you , mary , there were armies of angels .
there were ?
thousands .
i' d be happier if there weren' t .
when was he buried ?
three days ago .
roll away the stone .
lazarus .
lazarus .
in the name of the prophets ... ... in the name of jeremiah and my father ... ... in the name of the most holy god ... ... i call you here .
i call you here !
lazarus .
lazarus .
adonai .
god , help me .
we came here to pray .
look at this .
the money changers ?
it' s for the temple tax , for the feast .
i know .
i know .
how' s the exchange today ?
fair .
at this stall it' s always fair .
making a good profit ?
fair .
this is my father' s house !
it is a place of worship ... ... not a market !
nazarene , what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
god doesn' t need a palace .
he doesn' t need cypress trees or dead animals !
he doesn' t need shekels !
you expect people to pay the tax with roman coins .
they have images of false gods on them !
you want pagan gods in the temple ?
all foreign coins have to be exchanged for shekels .
that is the law .
i' m throwing away the law .
i have a new law and a new hope .
what ?
has god changed his mind about the old law ?
no .
he just thinks our hearts are ready to hold more , that' s all .
this chaos is your new law ?
how can you presume ...
how can i presume ?
i' m the end of the old law and the beginning of the new one .
watch what you' re saying .
maybe we should go .
when i say , " i , " rabbi ... ... l' m saying " god .
that' s blasphemy .
didn' t they tell you ?
i' m the saint of blasphemy .
don' t make any mistakes .
i didn' t come here to bring peace .
i came to bring a sword .
talking like that will get you killed .
me killed ?
listen to me .
this temple will be destroyed in three days .
torn down to the ground !
there won' t be one stone left to build with !
you think god belongs only to you ?
he doesn' t .
god' s an immortal spirit who belongs to everybody ... ... to the whole world !
you think you' re special ?
god is not an israelite !
magician , heal me .
cure us .
make us rich .
heal me !
do a miracle .
you want me to enter the world of god crippled like this ?
don' t touch me !
you' re filled with hate !
get away !
god won' t help you .
you cure us , or you won' t leave this city alive .
you don' t make demands on god !
judas !
what are you doing with this magician ?
you had orders to kill him and you haven' t done it .
now he acts like a prophet and you follow him .
did you hear what he said back there , saul ?
yes , i heard him .
we took an oath against rome .
i don' t see anything against rome here .
all i see are jews against jews .
then you' re not listening .
lazarus .
how do you feel ?
i like the light .
what was it like ?
which is better , death or life ?
i was a little surprised .
there wasn' t that much difference .
give me your hand .
i' m not surprised .
how could they let lazarus live ?
he was proof of your greatest miracle .
now there' s no more proof .
that' s what the zealots want .
their revolution , not yours .
you want to go back to them ?
no .
you' re the one i follow .
you are the strongest , aren' t you ?
of all my friends ... ... you' re the strongest .
judas , my brother ... ... l' ve something to tell you .
i have a terrible secret from god .
you know why i came to jerusalem ?
yes .
this is where the revolution is going to begin .
last night isaiah came to me .
he had a prophecy .
i saw it written .
he has borne our faults ...
... he was wounded for our transgressions ...
... yet he opened not his mouth .
despised and rejected by all ...
... he went forward without resisting , like a lamb led to the slaughter .
i don' t understand .
judas , i am the lamb .
i' m the one who' s going to die .
die ?
you mean you' re not the messiah ?
i am .
that can' t be .
if you' re the messiah , why do you have to die ?
listen .
at first , i didn' t understand ...
no , you , listen !
every day you have a different plan !
first it' s love , then it' s the axe , and now you have to die .
what good could that do ?
i can' t help it .
god only talks to me a little at a time .
he tells me as much as i need to know .
we need you alive !
now i finally understand .
all my life i' ve been followed ... ... by voices ... ... by footsteps ... ... by shadows .
and do you know what the shadow is ?
the cross .
i have to die on the cross and i have to die willingly .
we have to go back to the temple .
after you die on the cross , what happens then ?
i come back to judge the living and the dead .
i don' t believe you .
you have to .
i' m worried he' s going to change his mind again .
no , he won' t .
this time we' re not going to the temple to pray .
he said he' il destroy the temple in three days , and he' il do it .
and what if he doesn' t ?
what then ?
what if he doesn' t ?
you won' t have to worry because we' il all be dead .
we' re setting up a new government , building a new jerusalem .
we can ask for anything we want .
first , i' d like more sheep .
you know , my other sheep , i don' t even know where they are now .
this time i want a large herd , and i' il get other shepherds to care for them .
i would just like to be able to worship in the temple .
i mean really worship , without roman banners and soldiers .
that' s what i' d like .
of course .
but what else ?
i' il do anything the master asks , anything but get crucified .
you' re a coward , thomas .
yes , i am .
you know why ?
have you ever seen anyone on a cross after two days ?
you know what they look like ?
they don' t even have eyes .
the crows come and suck out your eyes .
and after that , you know what ?
dogs come and rip your feet off .
don' t talk that way .
i' ve made my decision .
you make yours .
and if you can' t , then get out now before we get to jerusalem .
i' m ready .
i have my knife .
master , i' ve been talking with the others and listening and ...
will there be angels there to meet us ?
or anyone besides who' s here ?
master .
king of the jews !
king of the jews !
king of the jews !
jesus !
lord , i hope this is what you want .
let me die here .
please let it happen fast while i have the strength .
i am here to set fire to the world .
in the desert , the baptist warned us , god is coming .
well , i' m telling you it' s too late .
he' s already here .
i' m here .
i' m going to baptize everybody with fire !
he' s leading us !
follow him !
they' re all with you , waiting for your signal .
give it !
now !
do it now !
please !
i' m waiting , too .
give me an axe , not the cross .
let me die like this .
give the sign now or we' re finished .
they' il kill us ...
we came to fight , not to die !
master , we knew it would be like this .
this is the way .
do it .
judas , help me !
stay with me .
don' t leave me .
i wish there was another way .
i' m sorry , but there isn' t .
i have to die on the cross .
i won' t let you die .
you have no choice , neither do i.
remember , we' re bringing god and man together .
they' il never be together unless i die .
i' m the sacrifice .
without you , there can be no redemption .
forget everything else .
understand that .
no , i can' t .
get somebody stronger .
you promised me .
remember , you once told me ... ... that if i moved one step from revolution , you' d kill me .
remember ?
yes .
i' ve strayed , haven' t i ?
yes .
then you must keep your promise .
you have to kill me .
if that' s what god wants , let god do it .
i won' t .
he will do it through you .
the temple guards will be looking for me where there aren' t any crowds .
we' il go to gethsemane .
you' il make sure that they find me there .
i am going to die .
but after three days ... ... l' il come back , in victory .
you can' t leave me .
you have to give me strength .
if you were me , could you betray your master ?
no .
that' s why god gave me the easier job ... ... to be crucified .
what about the others ?
i' il tell them tonight .
listen to me .
take this bread .
share it together .
this bread is my body .
now drink this wine .
pass the cup .
this wine is my blood .
do this to remember me .
we' re not finished .
let him go .
all of you ... ... i want to tell you something .
wait for me here .
father in heaven .
father on earth .
the world ... ... that you' ve created , that we can see , is beautiful .
but the world you' ve created , that we can' t see , is beautiful , too .
i don' t know .
i' m sorry , father .
i don' t know which is more beautiful .
this is my body , too .
together ... ... we' re going to die .
please , father .
i' ve been with you for so long .
i never asked you to choose me .
i always did as you said .
you made many miracles for others .
you opened the red sea for moses .
you saved noah .
you took elijah to heaven in a fiery chariot ... ... and now you' re asking me to be crucified .
can i ask you ... ... one last time ?
do i have to die ?
is there any other way ?
you' re offering me a cup , but i don' t want to drink what' s in it .
please , take it away .
please , stop .
please , father .
father .
please .
is this your answer ?
all right .
just please give me the strength .
couldn' t you stay awake with me for just an hour ?
i' m sorry .
it doesn' t matter .
it' s too late .
welcome , rabbi .
no .
you live by this , you die by it .
take me with you .
i' m ready .
so , you are the king of the jews ?
king " is your word .
well , you are jesus of nazareth , aren' t you ?
yes , i am .
that' s what they' re saying you are .
the king , the messiah .
it' s also said that you do miracles .
is this good magic or bad magic ?
could we have some kind of a demonstration ?
i mean , can you do a trick for me , now ?
no , i' m not a trained animal .
i' m not a magician .
that' s disappointing .
this means that you' re just another jewish politician .
do you want to know something ?
you' re more dangerous than the zealots .
do you know that ?
say something .
you had better say something .
all right .
tell me what you tell people on the streets .
yes ?
yes .
a tall statue that had a gold head and silver shoulders .
the stomach was bronze , the legs were iron , the feet were clay .
a stone was thrown .
the clay feet broke and the statue collapsed .
you see , god threw the stone .
the stone is me .
and rome ...
and rome is the statue , yes .
so your kingdom , or your world , will replace rome .
where is it ?
my kingdom ?
it' s not here .
not on earth .
it wouldn' t be , would it ?
it' s one thing to want to change the way that people live ... ... but you want to change how they think , how they feel .
all i' m saying is that change will happen with love , not with killing .
either way , it' s dangerous .
it' s against rome .
it' s against the way the world is .
and killing or loving , it' s all the same .
it simply doesn' t matter how you want to change things .
we don' t want them changed .
you do understand what has to happen ?
we have a space for you up on golgotha .
three thousand skulls there by now .
probably more .
guard .
i do wish you people would go out and count them some time .
maybe you' d learn a lesson .
probably not .
i know you .
i saw you with him .
you must be mistaken .
it wasn' t me .
it must have been someone else .
no , i' m right .
he is one of his followers .
he doesn' t know what he' s talking about .
he is one of his followers .
it' s him !
get him !
mother ?
magdalene ?
where are you ?
mother , i' m sorry for being a bad son .
father , stay with me .
don' t leave me .
father , forgive them .
father !
why have you forsaken me ?
who are you ?
i' m the angel who guards you .
your father is the god of mercy , not punishment .
he saw you and said , " aren' t you his guardian angel ?
well , go down and save him .
he' s suffered enough .
remember when he told abraham to sacrifice his son ?
abraham was just about to kill the boy with his knife when god stopped him .
so , if he saved abraham' s son , don' t you think he' d want to save his own ?
he' s tested you and he' s happy with you .
he doesn' t want your blood .
he said , " let him die in a dream .
but let him live his life .
all the pain .
that was real .
yes , but there won' t be any more .
you' ve done enough .
i don' t have to be sacrificed ?
no , you don' t .
i' m not the messiah ?
no , you' re not .
what about the others ?
don' t look back there .
god gave you life .
look ahead .
where are the disciples ?
they became frightened and ran away .
is this the world of god ?
the one i spoke about ?
no , this is earth .
why has it changed so much ?
it hasn' t changed .
you have .
now you can see its real beauty .
harmony between earth and the heart , that' s the world of god .
maybe you' il find this hard to believe ... ... but sometimes we angels look down on men and envy you .
really envy you .
what' s that ?
a wedding ceremony .
who' s getting married ?
you are .
what' s wrong ?
why are you crying ?
i' m thanking god ... ... for bringing you here .
we could have a child .
we could have a child .
where are you going ?
who are you going to kill ?
are you going to kill god ?
didn' t you hear me , jesus ?
there is nothing you can do .
god' s killed her .
god' s killed her .
god took her away when she was happy .
now she' s immortal .
she won' t see her love die or body decay .
i was there the whole time he was killing her and saw what happened .
but it wasn' t right .
it wasn' t right for god to take her .
you didn' t complain when god let you live .
you can' t complain now because he let her die .
trust god' s way .
listen .
there' s only one woman in the world .
one woman with many faces .
this one falls , the next one rises .
mary magdalene died ... ... but mary , lazarus' s sister ... ... she lives .
she' s magdalene with a different face .
she' s carrying your greatest joy inside her .
your son .
come with me .
this is the way the savior comes .
gradually , from embrace to embrace .
from son to son .
this is the road .
i understand .
mary .
look .
rabbi , i just want to see if it' s really you .
he' s real , like us .
don' t you see ?
come in .
come here .
master , i want to tell you one thing .
i' m sorry about magdalene .
i won' t ever leave you alone again .
i' il always protect you .
i don' t want you to take the wrong road and get lost again .
come inside .
i' il cook for you and your friend .
are you satisfied with me ?
do you have any complaints ?
none .
i' m ashamed when i think of it .
of what ?
of all the mistakes i' ve made .
of all the wrong ways i looked for god .
where' s mary ?
she won' t be back till this evening .
come inside .
it' s too hot out here .
come inside .
there' s only one woman in the world .
go inside .
we don' t have to get involved .
come on , stay out of it .
here , watch your brother .
remember to thank god for the food and leave some for me .
i' il be back soon .
aren' t you going to eat ?
i want to hear what he says .
you don' t have to go there .
i lied , i stole , i cheated ... ... i gambled , i whored , i drank and persecuted , tortured and murdered .
yes , murdered !
i killed anyone who broke the law of moses .
and i loved it , i enjoyed it , i relished it , i reveled in it .
because i thought i was doing god' s will .
i thought i was doing god' s will .
and the high priest of jerusalem sent me to damascus to scourge that city .
and on the road to damascus , just outside the city , in the middle of the day ... ... i was struck by a white light that blinded me !
yes .
saul , why are you persecuting me ?
why are you against me ?
who are you ? " i said .
jesus .
and he ... ... made me see .
i was led helpless like a child , into a city that i was sent to scourge .
and god sent me ananias instead ... ... and he put his hands on me and i opened my eyes ... ... and i was baptized and became paul .
and now i bring the good news to you .
it' s about jesus of nazareth .
he was not the son of mary .
he was the son of god .
his mother was a virgin .
and the angel gabriel came down and put god' s seed in her womb .
that' s how he was born .
and he was punished for our sins .
then he was tortured and crucified .
but three days later he rose up from the dead ... ... and went up to heaven .
death was conquered !
amen .
do you understand what that means ?
he conquered death .
all of our sins were forgiven ... ... and now the world of god is open to every one of us .
to everybody !
did you ever see this jesus of nazareth after he came back from the dead ?
i mean , with your own eyes ?
no , but i saw a light that blinded me and i heard his voice .
you' re a liar .
his disciples saw him .
they were hiding in an attic , the doors locked , and he appeared to them .
liar .
he' s a liar !
wait a minute .
wait a minute , i want to talk to you .
i was never crucified .
i never came back from the dead .
i' m a man .
quiet !
why are you telling these lies ?
what are you talking about ?
i' m the son of mary and joseph .
i' m the one who preached in galilee .
i had followers , we marched on jerusalem .
pilate condemned me and god saved me .
no , he didn' t .
who are you talking about ?
don' t try to tell me what happened , because i know .
i live like a man now .
i work , eat , have children .
i enjoy my life .
for the first time , i' m enjoying it .
do you understand me ?
so don' t go around telling lies about me , or i' il tell everybody the truth !
wait just a minute .
what' s the matter with you ?
look around you .
look at all these people .
look at their faces .
do you see how unhappy they are ?
do you see how they' re suffering ?
their only hope is the resurrected jesus .
i don' t care whether you' re jesus or not .
the resurrected jesus will save the world and that' s what matters .
those are lies .
you can' t save the world by lying .
i created the truth out of what people needed and what they believed .
if i have to crucify you to save the world , then i' il crucify you .
and if i have to resurrect you , then i' il do that , too .
i won' t let you .
i' il tell everyone the truth .
go ahead .
go on .
tell them now .
who' s going to believe you ?
you started all this , now you can' t stop it .
all those people who believe me will kill you .
no .
that wouldn' t happen .
how do you know ?
you see , you don' t know how much people need god .
you don' t know how happy he can make them .
happy to do anything .
he can make them happy to die and they' il die .
all for the sake of christ .
jesus christ .
jesus of nazareth .
the son of god .
the messiah .
not you .
not for your sake .
you know , i' m glad i met you .
because now i can forget all about you .
my jesus is much more important and much more powerful .
thank you .
it' s a good thing i met you .
don' t ever leave me .
i' m happy here .
i remember when mary and i planted these vines .
you know , this will all pass .
why ?
are you leaving me ?
we have to move on .
you' ve grown old .
you' ve done well .
we' ve both done well .
get inside .
get inside , fast !
jerusalem is on fire !
it' s burning !
the romans are killing everyone .
move out of the way .
we were sent here .
god told us you would show yourself to us .
he said you were dying .
peter ?
is that you ?
i can' t tell .
what happened to you ?
i got old .
you got old .
this one i know .
no matter how old you get , i know you , nathaniel .
you were the best shepherd because you had no sheep .
rabbi .
i missed you .
and you ?
they cut you .
your face .
who are you ?
john .
the romans tortured me , cut my face .
i tried to tell them all about you .
then i saw jerusalem burn .
i even saw the ark of the covenant stolen from the temple .
they destroyed the temple , just like you said .
the ark ?
there' s someone else outside .
be careful .
he' s still angry .
judas .
judas , come in .
didn' t you hear me ?
i missed you so much .
he hears you .
he just won' t say anything .
he' s been fighting in jerusalem .
look at his hands .
there' s still blood on them .
judas , the master is speaking to you .
answer him .
traitor !
your place was on the cross .
that' s where god put you .
when death got too close , you got scared and you ran away ... ... and you hid yourself in the life of some man .
we did what we were supposed to do !
you didn' t !
you' re a coward !
don' t you have any respect ?
for him ?
you don' t understand .
understand ?
you broke my heart .
sometimes i curse the day i ever met you .
we held the world in our hands .
remember what you told me ?
you took me in your arms .
do you remember ?
and you begged me , " betray me , betray me .
i have to be crucified .
i have to be resurrected so i can save the world .
i am the lamb , " you said .
death is the door .
judas , my brother , don' t be afraid .
help me go through the door .
and i loved you so much .
i went and betrayed you .
and you ...
... you ...
what are you doing here ?
what business do you have here with women , with children ?
what' s good for man isn' t good for god .
why weren' t you crucified ?
look at his wounds , judas .
they' re bleeding .
you' re hurting him .
that' s enough .
he was going to be the new covenant .
now there' s no more israel .
no , you don' t understand .
the guardian angel .
god sent a guardian angel to save me .
what angel ?
look at her .
satan .
i told you we would meet again .
if you die this way , you die like a man .
you turned against god , your father .
there' s no sacrifice .
there' s no salvation .
there' s nothing you can do .
you lived this life .
you accepted it .
it' s over now .
you just finish it and die .
die like a man .
father .
will you listen to me ?
are you still there ?
will you listen to a selfish , unfaithful son ?
i fought you when you called .
i resisted .
i thought i knew more .
i didn' t want to be your son .
can you forgive me ?
i didn' t fight hard enough .
father ... ... give me your hand .
i want to bring salvation !
father , take me back !
make a feast !
welcome me home !
i want to be your son !
i want to pay the price !
i want to be crucified and rise again !
i want to be the messiah !
it is accomplished !
it is accomplished .
