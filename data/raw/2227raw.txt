i hate television .
gives me headaches . ... makes your color treated hair ...
you know , i heard there' s so many magnetic waves traveling through the air because of tv and telephones , that we' re losing , like ten times as many brain cells as we' re supposed to .
like , all the molecules in our heads are all unstable .
all the companies know about it but they' re not doing anything about it .
it' s , like , a big conspiracy .
you can pick something .
i don' t care .
say hello to luscious , full bod ...
you have any idea how many electro rays are traveling through our head every second ?
i got a better one .
have you heard about this videotape that kills you when you watch it ?
what kind of tape ?
a tape , a regular tape .
people rent it , i don' t know .
you start to play it and it' s , like , somebody' s nightmare .
then suddenly , this woman comes on smiling at you , right ?
seeing you through the screen ... and as soon as it' s over ... your phone rings .
someone knows you' ve watched it and what they say is ...
you will die in seven days " and exactly seven days later ...
who told you that ?
somebody from revere .
i don' t ...
who told you ?
what' s your problem ?
i' ve watched it .
it' s a story , katie .
no , me and josh , we saw it last weekend .
i thought you were with your parents .
i wanted to tell you .
you were with josh all weekend ?
some of his friends got this this place up in the mountains .
they were trying to record a football game .
i guess the reception was so bad ...
what are you talking about ?
listen to me !
when we played the tape , the game wasn' t there .
it was ...
what ?
wh what was it ?
it was something else .
we thought it was some kind of sick joke ... and then the phone rang .
it was a week ago ... one week ago tonight .
you' re just trying to scare me .
oh , my god , katie !
are you okay ?
katie ... oh , my ...

that asshole' s screaming for my attention and i' m not going to give it to him .
i am being objective !

harvey ?

hey ...
hey .
sorry i' m late .
no worries .
i' il wait in the car .
have you got a moment , ms. keller ?
um , sure .
call me rachel .
please , sit down .
he certainly is very independent , isn' t he ?
oh , yeah , he sure is .
i never have to tell him to do anything .
well , if that' s a problem you' d be the first teacher in history to say so .
ms. keller ...
rachel .
i know that aidan recently lost his cousin ...
yes , and i' m doing what i can to find him some good daycare .
it' s just ...
oh , no , that' s not what i meant .
by all means , take your time .
i know they were very close , aidan and his cousin .
yeah .
they spent a few nights a week together .
did he talk to you about her death ?
well , like you said , he' s not the talkative type .
that doesn' t mean he has nothing to say .
he knows i' m there .
yes , i' m sure he does but he may be expressing himself in ... other ways .
i' d like to show you something .
that' s his cousin .
that' s katie .
ms. keller ...
i' m bothered by these drawings .
listen , i appreciate your concern but my son lost his best friend three nights ago .
he' s just trying to deal with it .
yes , i understand , but these pictures ...
are aidan' s way of working it out ... of expressing himself , like you said .
he' il be okay .
you say she died three nights ago ?
yeah , that' s right .
aidan drew these last week .
what ?
nothing .
shall we read something ?
i' m kind of tired .
okay .
sweet dreams .
we don' t have enough time .
oh , honey , i know i' ve been working a lot and i' m sorry but i promise you , i' m going to make it up to you .
i' m not talking about that .
i' m talking about time before we die .
you have lots of time .
so , you know when i' m going to die ?
no .
no one does but i know you don' t have to worry about it .
katie knew .
she told me .
katie told you she was going to die ?
she said she didn' t have enough time .
good night , rachel .
oh , shit !
aidan ...
goddamn it !
honey ? !
have you seen my black dress ?
aidan ?
have you seen my black ... dress ?
it' s a little wrinkled .
it' s fine .
yeah .
thank you .
kids don' t have strokes ... unless they' re on drugs .
so , then , why the closed coffin ?
oh , ruthie .
i' m so sorry .
you all right , dave ?
yeah , i' m fine .
how are you ?
he sleeps all day .
he doesn' t move .
it' s too much for him .
it doesn' t make any sense , rachel .
i spent four hours on the internet and i couldn' t find one single case of a 16 year old girl' s heart just stopping .
i spoke to three different doctors and not one of them could tell me exactly what happened to my daughter .
she was close ... with you .
and aidan .
but she confided in you .
yeah , but she never said anything ... nothing that would explain what happened .
but you could find out .
it' s what you do , isn' t it ask questions ?
rachel , please .
i saw her face .
i knew becca .
i mean , she was a little intense , but she wasn' t crazy .
they don' t put you in booties and a straightjacket if you' re just freaked out .
something scared the shit out of her .
hi .
so , who' s in the mental hospital ?
becca ...
katie' s friend .
oh , right .
she was the one who was ...
there when it happened .
so , what do you think they were doing up there ?
oh , thanks .
i remember i was that age .
me and my girlfriend used to sneak up to my room , get high .
do you think maybe she was into ... ?
it' s not about that .
it' s about the tape .
kellen , don' t even .
what tape ?
the one that kills you when you watch it .
oh , please .
what was on the tape ?
i haven' t seen it , obviously .
but katie told you she saw this tape ?
not katie .
i heard it from her boyf ...
you heard it from who ?
she was dating this guy josh .
he goes to revere .
it was kind of a secret .
kind of ?
where is he josh ?
is is he here ?
josh is dead .
what ?
what happened ?
supposedly , he killed himself ... the same night that katie died .
aidan ... what are you doing in here ?
come on .
we shouldn' t be in her room .
it' s not her room anymore .
10 : 00 p . m .
10 : 00 p . m .
time of death , wade that' s all i want to know .
the name' s katie embrey .
pull the report and read the time .
no , that' s okay .
i' il hold .
punctilious prick " ?
nice alliteration , huh ?
you' re fired .
no , i' m not .
yes , you are .
no , i' m not .
i' m cooking too good a story .
what is it ?
yeah , i' m still here .
shh !
okay , so what' s the time of death ?
hi .
i was wondering ...
pick a card , any card .
go ahead .
okay , put it back .
don' t let me see it .
that your card ?
no .
damn .
i was wondering if you' d remember someone from a week ago .
was there a problem ?
it' s my niece .
she sort of ran out on her parents .
no .
i have some photos here .
that' s her and her friends .
i think they stayed here a night or so .
yeah , they were in cabin 12 .
they didn' t pay .
had a number of complaints , about the tv , mainly .
uh , reception' s never good here .
that' s why we bought tape players for videos .
quite a selection .
mostly they' re hand me downs
left by other guests .
anyway , they didn' t pay .
and kids like that sometimes don' t .
miss ?
you know , i' m kind of tired .
i' m thinking i might take a nap before i drive back .
i' il take cabin 12 .
hey .
this is your card , right ?
that' s it .
seven days .
i' m going to school .
hold up .
what do you think ?
well , it' s a pretty cool effect .
what does this have to do with the tape ?
take my picture .
are you going to look at me at least ?
this the same camera ?
no .
scan the rest .
so , what do you think ?
well , look , i thought you said this was about a tape .
i' m thinking maybe you shouldn' t see it .
no , i should know more about it first .
well , isn' t that why i' m here ?
so you can benefit from my wisdom ?
four kids are dead , noah .
not from watching a videotape .
come on , show it to me .
roll credits .
that was very student film .
i' m sure it' s a lot ... scarier at night .
you going to get that ?
so , you been working a lot ?
i' m not tired , noah .
okay .
that tape didn' t scare you ?
no , not really .
sorry .
four people are dead .
yeah , but like i said , not from watching ...
four people who watched it .
come on , we watched it .
we' re hanging .
it ... takes a week .
right .
yeah , i' m just going to go downtown .
i got to pick up some cameras from this guy and then i got to prep this thing that i may end up doing next week .
noah ...
hmm ?
would you say that i' m gullible ?
no .
easily rattled ?
definitely not .
i mean , you' re a little highly strung maybe .
and you ain' t much of a dresser .
who made it ?
where' d it come from ?
all right .
make me a copy .
i' il see what i can do .
thanks .
yeah .
you sure this is a copy ?
yeah , why ?
the numbers are all screwed up .
the same problem got copied , i guess .
that' s impossible .
the numbers of the control track they put on the tape whenever it' s recorded which means theoretically , there shouldn' t be any images .
hey , noah , can you pretend for one minute that i don' t read video geek magazine ?
okay , when you record a tape the makeup of the tracks is like a signature for whatever did the recording
like a camcorder , vcr , whatever .
so the control track could tell us where it came from .
but to not have one ...
i mean , that' s like being born without fingerprints .
then , how did this get recorded ?
i don' t know .
but i' m going to find out .
all right , take a look .
you should be able to see the camera here in the reflection .
the angle' s straight on , but you don' t .
hmm .
what' s that ?
it looks like she' s walking away whoever she is .
no , i mean up there at the top .
oh , no , that' s just the tracking .
i can fix that .
whup , sorry .
wait , go back .
there' s something there .
yeah , you' re right .
there' s more picture .
hold on .
i' m going to stretch the alignment .
yeah , it' s working .
yeah , it won' t go any further .
okay , keep going .
no , no , no , no , let me do it .
wait , it won' t go any further .
it won' t go any further !
get ...
let me do it .
shit !
oh ...
hey , noah
i picked up the cameras .
they' re in really good shape .
did you see the reprints i did of that guatemala stuff ?
' cause they came out kind of ... overexposed .
you working ?
this is a friend , rachel keller .
she writes for the " p. i.
rachel , this is beth , my assistant .
well , i prefer " partner in crime .
she' s a journalism student at kirkland , actually .
well , i' il stay out of your way .
i' m not even here .
rachel is researching a story .
it' s this video hoax .
it' s sort of interesting .
so you know video .
why don' t you come take a look at this thing with the tracking .
you know , i' m late .
i really should go .
yeah , but why are you taking ... ?
i got to go .
it' s good to meet you .
so you' re taking the tape ?
i don' t want her to see it .
whoa .
you don' t want her to see it ?
what about me seeing it ?
you had no problem showing it to me .
i did have a problem .
you' re angry .
i' m not angry .
oh , no ?
what are you then ?
in a hurry .
look , i' m sorry , but i' m not going to get all worked up over some high school rumor .
what are you thinking ?
i' m thinking this is the part where i say
you' re a flake , never finishes anything .
then you say i' m " an obsessive bitch .
needs to lighten up .
then i storm out all pissed off , kicking myself for ever thinking that you could just ... grow up .
so , why don' t we just cut to that part right now and save ourselves a lot of grief ?
all right .
bye .
watch out , missy .
bad luck .
you don' t need that .
becca ?
becca .
we' re almost there .
summer , actually .
so circle gets that square .
we take a break , while you check this out .
this is how you can be part ...
do you remember anything about that night ... that night with katie ?
do you remember ... how she died ?
becca ?
she told you about a videotape , didn' t she ?
she was afraid , wasn' t she ?
something was happening to her .
becca ... how did she die ?
please .
i need to know .
and you will .
she' il show you .
who ?
who will show me ?
not now .
four days .
yeah , well , your home vcrs will give you a tracking window but they won' t let you stretch it .
there' s no point , really , unless you' re talking restoration .
archives will come in here with these crummy old tapes sometimes .
tracks totally shot servos can' t line them up .
but the big box here' s a warhorse .
totally analog .
she' il read to the very edge of your tape .
just don' t force her or she' il get pissy with you .
your tracking , your monitor , your printer , if you need it .
so , uh ... what are we watching , home movies or something ?
i' d really rather watch it alone .
really .
whatever .
come on ...
come on .
lighthouse .
shit .
hello ?
somebody ?
damn .
something you needed help with ?
hey , you ... you got a ... ya ...
well , that seems to be the lot of it .
thank you .

you , too .
hi .
sorry i' m late .
uh ... mmm ... no .
no problem .
everything okay ?
oh , yeah .
he was an angel .
i i ... went in to tell him that it was bedtime and he was already under the covers .
and then he read me a bedtime story .
um ... he learned the word " conundrum .
really ?
yeah .
and then ... he drew my picture .
well , here you go .
thanks .
sure .
hey , ruthie , it' s me .
i' m sorry to call so late , but i need a favor .
i have to go upstate to do this story and i need you to watch aidan for me .
oh , rachel , i don' t know .
how long will you be gone ?
it' s just for two days , i promise .
this isn' t the best time for me .
rachel ?
rachel , are you there ?
hold on a sec ...
sorry .
rachel ?
is this about katie ?
ruthie ...
aidan ?
no !
why , baby , why ?

rachel ?
noah ...
l listen to me .
r rachel ...
i need to talk to you , okay ?
i ...
i believe you .
rachel , you there ?
he ...
he watched the tape .
who ?
who watched it ?
our son .
you took my picture .
i' ve seen you .
when i' m in the yard at school .
you' re there .
you wish i was around more ?
no .
do you want to be around more ?
rachel and i were ...
young .
mom' s told me that story .
the thing is , i ...
i don' t think i' d make a good father .
maybe it was because my own was ... such a ... disappointment .
thing is , i don' t want anyone else to do it , either .
be your father .
it' s a conundrum .
yeah , it is .
time to go , mister .
i' m not finished .
noah said to make one for you .
you could almost draw a line through her life .
on one side , there' s this happy woman who spends her time with her husband , riding horses everything sheltered , protected and comfortable .
her face , there' s ... light , there' s pride .
and then , one day , something happens and she takes this hard corner and the light ... goes out and then she ends up at eola county psychiatric all alone .
what happened to her ? .
i don' t know yet but i think it has something to do with the horses .
it think we should go to the island together .
it' s tuesday , noah .
i only have one day left .
i need you to go to the hospital and find out as much as you can about anna .
the images on the tape are leading us somewhere .
katie saw them all , too .
i think ... before you die you see the ring .
shit !
hey , rach !
wait !
a daughter ?
