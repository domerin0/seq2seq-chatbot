it' s you again , nagara .
get yourself together !
damn !
you use your muscle to swing your sword , so you give in to the weight of the sword .
learn from azumi .
the strength comes not from muscle , but from speed !
wher e is azumi ?
oh yeah , she' s not here .
she was just her e a while ago .
yeah , she often disappears .
azumi !
azumi !
azumi
i wonder how far this sky goes .
it' il be any day now when we cross that mountain and enter the outside world .
that' s right .
we are going to pursue our mission then .
excellent ...
yes , we are always going to stick together .
can' t wait to leave this mountain and raise some hell !
i can' t see any stars .
of course you can' t .
it' s still daytime .
stars only come out at night .
then where are they during the day ?
time to eat !
i' m starving .
we' re starving !
master , isn' t this a bit overcooked ?
fresh water fish tastes better when it' s burnt like this .
nagara .
yes , master .
you' r e soaking wet .
what happened to you ?
we were training in underwater combat .
master , he lost again today .
he fell into the river .
he lost and fell into the river .
skip your meal today .
no food , no mission , you have no chance .
what do you mean , fools ! ?
hey , stop .
let' s get him .
hey , let' s eat .
come , hurry up .
ouch , that hurts .
lately i' m beginning to see who' s the strongest .
either nachi or azumi ar e number 1 and 2 ...
azumi is fast , and nachi is strong .
the rest of us ar e more or less the same .
i think i am one of the strongest would' nt you all agree ?
hey , is that your only response ?
nachi , that looks cool .
good luck charm , is it supposed to work ?
something like this only works for someone who believes in it .
then it won' t work for me .
yeah , well , you' re a monkey .
i don' t want to hear that from a frog face like you .
he' s a frog , a frog !
we are going to leave this mountain .
leave ?
this mountain ?
do you really mean it , master ?
at last , the time has come for us to carry out our mission .
yes .
fina ly , we' il all get to carry out our mission .
is this your son ?
our lord tokugawa won the war , yet all this misery is left behind .
it' s time we put an end to such wars .
we must try everything possible to build a peaceful nation .
i doubt very much that the toyotomi allies will retreat now .
most likely this conflict and chaos will continue for some time to come .
unless we eradicate ambitious warlords trying to take over the nation , we will never see any peace here .
gessai .
assassins are the answer .
train a group of master assassins and have them exterminate every single warlord who intends to cause conflict .
priest tenkai , i , gessai , swear on my life to accomplish your wish .
azumi , wake everyone up and bring them to the clearing .
i had acknowledged your potential when you were yet very young , and have trained and br ought up all ten of you .
your skills in the martial ar ts already exceed by far those of warriors in the outside world .
the time has finally come for you to go to the outside world , unknown to you since you were br ought here , and use your skills to perform your duty .
you all grew up and trained together , thus you all know one another truly well and have strong bonds .
now , make a team of two with the one you like best .
azumi .
are you done ?
listen to me well .
the mission that will be given to you from this moment on will be most sever e and rigorous .
an assassin is unable to choose whom to kill .
depending on your mission , sometimes you must kill a child , or a great and respected person .
thus , i give you this final test .
slay each other .
slay your teammate .
kill !
the one who loses this fight and loses his life has no aptitude to pursue the mission that lies ahead of us .
the weak minded one who can' t kill his friend will not be able to pursue his mission either .
the winners of this fight should terminate their counterpart and come back to the hut .
should you think of escaping without fighting , you must know that you cannot survive .
begin !
it' s master' s order .
we have no choice .
nagara !
come !
i want to pursue my mission .
i trust that you do , too .
nachi .
one of us will be left alive and pursue our mission .
nachi .
nachi , don' t do it !
azumi .
this is our destiny .
get r eady !
azumi ...
you have become really strong .
nachi .
take this ...
this is crazy !
why ?
why ?
why ?
i don' t know why either .
but if we try as hard now as they would have tried in pursuing our mission , their deaths won' t be in vain , right , master ?
so this is a village .
master .
aren' t we going to help ?
master .
don' t move , don' t get involved !
how come ?
we can easily get rid of them .
you have an impor tant mission .
this is no time to be mixed up in a trifling matter .
they will all be massacr ed .
don' t dr aw your sword unless it is your mission to do so .
isn' t it our mission to slay those kinds of bad guys ?
master !
why , why not ?
why , master ?
why couldn' t we kill them ?
merely kil ing a hundr ed bandits will not change this nation .
as always , well done .
these kids have gr own up to be pr etty sharp .
what' s going on ?
i brought a letter fr om priest tenkai .
guys , good luck .
who was that ?
he is a ninja called nagato .
throughout this grave mission , he will be in and out , but always moving along with us .
what does it say ?
the following three warlords , nagamasa asano , kiyomasa kato
and masayuki sanasa will not regard the battle
of sekigahara as the ultimate defeat of the toyotomi .
they claim the young prince , hideyori ,
to be the true loyal successor to the head of the nation .
they press for the leadership of the nation to be
returned to toyotomi once he becomes an adult .
these three are dangerous rebels who will harm tokugawa .
they should be eliminated .
hey , girl .
what are you doing ?
stop right there .
it' s a young girl on her own .
it' s okay .
yes , sir .
what a pretty girl she is , isn' t she ?
what are you doing ?
can' t you see what i' m doing ?
i' m fishing .
fishing ?
haven' t you ever fished ?
oh , i see , you have never gone fishing .
fishing is fun .
and , when i am fishing like this ,
i can for get about all of the terrible things that go on in this country .
moreover , if you catch a big fish like this , you can boast for the rest of your life .
fur thermore , a couple of fish from this pond will make you ful .
so you are hungry , and you want to eat a fish .
this is how you catch a fish .
what the hell' s she doing ?
kill him now !
that' s enough .
let' s go !
well , you ar e very amusing .
what is your name ?
azumi .
what' s yours ?
girl , you' d better watch how you talk to our lord .
my name is nagamasa .
nagamasa asano is my name .
you are the one that wants to start another war .
why ?
such a young girl .
what a pity .
i feel sorry for you ...
ar e you sure about that ?
yes , sir .
asano clan is concealing the fact , but nagamasa was assassinated .
all of the guards were killed .
how did they do that ?
who are these assassins ?
they must be of the leyasu clan .
lord ...
if i may say so , we do not have any proof that they are of the eyasu clan .
proof ?
ever since leyasu won the victory over the ishida forces in sekigahara ,
leyasu has been acting as though he has the whole nation under his thumb .
the r egime belongs to our prince hideyori toyotomi .
nagamasa , masayuki sanada and i had pr essed him to return the r egime to prince hideyori .
the r esult is nagamasa' s assassination .
i am next on the list .
i am quite aware of that .
please remain cautious , my lord .
what ?
this talk of proof and caution , kanbei , what happened to your warrior' s way ?
kanbei , it wi i be too late once my head is cut off .
i , kanbei , wi i not die after you , my lord .
i , kiyomasa kato , am not intimidated by any enemy .
leyasu is a stupid fool .
if all the warlords of the toyotomi side unite to fight against leyasu , he doesn' t stand a chance .
i am troubled with a temperamental boss .
saru .
yes , sir .
we' il let them kill our lord .
azumi !
it' s a signal .
they got kiyomasa !
okay , let' s go .
they would be happy up in heaven for us .
but master , they wer en' t tough at all .
those slowpokes were no match for us .
it' s not that they weren' t tough , it' s that you are too strong .
that' s why you can' t easily show your strength outside of our mission .
that ninja who looked like a monkey , he was funny , wasn' t he ?
ninja ?
has anyone received any cut from their weapons ?
master , ther e' s no way any ninja can get us .
ninja or any other , no one will be our match .
right .
but be careful , ninjas daub poison on their weapons .
poison ?
even if it' s just a pinch of poison , it may take your life .
oh , man , that' s scary !
hey , azumi , are you alright ?
what' s the matter , azumi ?
i was wondering if that nagamasa we killed the other day , and this guy today , are they truly bad guys ?
what are you talking about ?
what' s gotten into you ?
but we don' t know a thing about the guy we killed .
he must have friends like we do .
no time for silly nonsense , azumi .
they have to be bad guys , otherwise , why would we have to kill them .
right , master ?
no need to ask such a question .
enough of this nonsense .
have a mind of steel .
be quiet !
just eat !
we have completed our mission .
i' m going to take a piss , then .
well done in finding a double who ooked exactly like me .
can you kill those assassins next time ?
definitely , my lord .
kanbei ...
it amuses me to see your failure , but the fun is over now .
saru ...
yes , sir .
we wi i start the attack this time .
it hurts !
i made a hole .
that' s cool !
big brother , you' re very strong .
you' re not so bad yourse f .
know .
right everyone , right ?
hey old man ...
listen big brother , i think i should open a hole in the left , that would look awesome .
you dumb ass !
if you keep doing stupid things like that , mom will get angry .
no , i am scared of our mom .
she is scary !
i' m sacred of our mom .
watch your step .
it' s slippery with blood .
i' m bacj , you guys .
you' re back .
i brought a client .
he' s got a job for us .
brother , he looks like a monkey .
oh , oh , he got mad .
so , what' s the job ?
as a matter of principle , i don' t read letters .
these ar e horrible assassins .
as soon as you find them , kill them without a word .
it r eads like that .
this is the drawing .
sorry , they' re a bit slow .
this girl is cute .
so , one girl , one old man , guys , one , two , three , four ... ... that' s it ?
don' t underestimate them .
they are tough , very tough .
we , sajiki brothers , have nothing to complain about if we can kil and make some money .
she is very beautiful .
oh , look over there .
master , can we go take a look ?
yes , go and have some fun .
that was great .
yes , thank you , thank you .
my name is hyuga .
i am yae .
great .
you guys are better than us .
please , join our troupe .
have you trained yourself since you were little ?
yeah , you can call it training .
hyuga , are you guys performers ?
no , but we' ve been living up in the mountain , so we ar e flexible .
i see .
we' ve also been doing this ever since we cou d remember , but we' re not as good as you .
since you could r emember ?
yes .
that' s just like us .
this is beautiful .
it' s from a foreign country .
a foreign country ?
yes , beyond the ocean .
come on , pack up quickly .
the sun will go down soon .
yes , boss .
are you leaving ?
we ar e leaving tomorr ow at noon .
we ar e traveling performers .
if we perform the same act in the same place , we won' t have an audience .
no , i' il come tomorrow , and every day after that , to see you .
thank you .
but i have been living like this since i was little .
stay well .
i' il see you again someplace .
come on .
hyuga , let' s go .
how are the sajiki brothers ?
the sajiki brothers are chasing the assassins .
they' ve confirmed the whereabouts of the enemy .
i have little confidence in those dim witted brothers to kill the assassins .
i know .
those sajiki brothers are just meant to be the first attack .
saru , go to the prison in nishikawa .
you mean to get that guy out ?
eye for an eye .
poison for poison .
amagi , hyuga , time to wake up .
get up .
oh no , i slept in .
master , can i go out for a while ?
where to ?
i want to see the street performers one more time .
oh , that sweet one .
i think i can learn from her movement for my technique .
don' t fall for a girl in a traveling company .
shut up !
well , master , may i go ?
we' re leaving at noon .
come back by then .
i' il go with you , too .
me , too .
amagi , aren' t you coming ?
they are in a playful mood .
are you sure it' s okay , master ?
hey , amagi , wake up !
how long do you need to sleep ?
i thought we wer e to meet tomorrow evening .
things don' t look good .
what ?
they killed kiyomasa' s double and not kiyomasa himself .
the enemy is onto us .
they' ve sent a party of pursuers .
master , what' s wrong ?
we' ve been deceived .
what ?
kiyomasa is still alive .
we killed his double .
go get everyone .
we are leaving at once .
amagi , i' ve been telling you to get up .
amagi , what' s wrong ?
why didn' t you say anything ?
they are gone .
oh well .
hyuga !
yae was so sweet .
you' re fond of yae , aren' t you ?
i wanted to spend a little more time with her .
i finally met someone i liked .
they may not be too far yet .
let' s go .
come !
oh that' s it !
let' s look for them .
come on , let' s go .
i' m sorry , master .
i can still do it .
our mission ...
enough .
don' t talk .
i messed up .
i swore i would work ... as much as all of our dead comrades .
they were a lot of fun .
yae , i know who you like .
who ?
azumi ?
no , i am talking about the guy .
what are you talking about ?
you can' t hide it .
i know these things very well .
even if you fall in love , he' s a traveler and so are we .
you' il never see him again .
such romances don' t stand a chance .
are these them ?
the ages are right on the mark .
and there is an old man too .
one , two , three , one two three , one ...
ar en' t there too many ?
there are more girls , and not enough boys .
a rough count will do .
by the way , do you see them ?
these girls are incredible .
no two ways about it , they are the assassins .
they don' t look like the drawing .
a rough r esemblance will do .
excuse me , sirs .
what can we do for you ?
wher e are you going .
wher e are you headed ?
you' r e cute .
come , i won' t do anything .
you sure are pretty .
what' s your name ?
tell me your name .
let me touch you a little .
get this out of the way .
damn , brother .
what a waste .
nisai , don' t you go too far .
don' t waste your life .
don' t come near me .
give it back .
you scared me .
stay back .
they look like the assassins too .
that' s them , brother .
she is cute .
are you pursuing us ?
yes .
you' re getting the idea .
they have nothing to do with us !
we kill whoever we like ...
oh , i see .
then you have no complaints if you get ki led .
you are gor geous .
you fool !
hyuga !
you are truly cute .
that hurts !
it' s not over , yet !
