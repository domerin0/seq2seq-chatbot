come here !
man , what were you thinking ?
this was our thing .
you dragged jule into it .
why didn t you tell me sooner ?
i don' t know .
i just wanted to help .
we won' t hurt you , ok ?
you can trust me .
ok , drive .
got the flashlight ?
go on !
be careful .
it' s a 100 meter drop .
two people were killed last year .
put the groceries there .
we can sleep in here .
good .
a fire ?
yeah , super .
the matches are up here .
your uncle comes here often ?
hardly ever .
does he rent it out ?
no .
we say we are on vacation .
in case the forest ranger comes by .
don' t let hardenberg out .
good morning .
we' il make it .
i don' t know how , but we' il get out of this .
how about a 70s style political kidnapping ?
prisoner of the edukators
we tape it for the tv stations .
this is our chance , guys .
finally a living example to test our methods .
we need bread , milk and toilet paper .
and a newspaper .
a radio wouldn' t be bad .
i' il go down and check the village .
i' il shop .
you guys cook .
someone have money ?
not really .
hardenberg' s buying first round .
how' s the people' s prison ?
careful !
what are you expecting ?
by reaching so few ?
reach one , educate 100 " ?
words get around .
we might get some copycats .
we are just the fuse .
you think you' re so much better ?
you' re not better than terrorists .
you use the same methods ...
spreading fear and panic .
our goal isn' t to be better at any price .
we think it' s more original to have a cause ...
to make a difference
isn' t that crazy ?
we struggle like crazy to minimize your damage .
how ungrateful !
our little break ins are nothing .
compared to the violence used by people like you .
the state legitimizes you .
us ...
we get it from ourselves .
so you' re germany' s savior ?
the new millennium' s raf ?
we' re not hanging out in pubs talking about the great revolution .
but it' s true ...
serious action makes you vulnerable .
how truly terrible !
peter , we never discussed it ...
how do you endure it all ?
maybe because i' m not particularly cultivated .
or maybe because ...
i' m just a really cool guy .
what will you do with me ?
you' il see soon .
we have 3 possibilities .
plan a , we make this a kidnapping and demand ransom money .
at least this shit will give us money for a new life .
we surely can' t go back to the old one .
all in the past , jule .
plan b ...
we put him in the morgue .
are you crazy ?
you' ve really lost it !
jule , i' m joking .
calm down .
i' ve had it with your dumb jokes .
this is about a human being !
ok !
bad joke .
i' il be serious .
plan b , we leave him here with food for a week .
then we inform the rangers .
but not before we' re far away .
tea ?
what do you earn per year ?
more or less 200 000 .
3 . 4 million .
that' s what i read in tagesspiegel .
sounds like more , not less .
don' t you feel guilty ?
ruining a girl' s life for a car worth petty cash to you .
why ?
alright .
i should have paid more attention to who was involved .
i was stressed out .
i' m sorry .
how many hours a day do you work ?
13 , 14 hours , easily .
what do you do with all that money ?
you amass things .
big , expensive things .
fat cars , enormous villa , a yacht ...
i' m an alpha male " .
i can' t see any other reason .
you don' t even have time to cruise on your yacht .
so why do you always want more ?
we live in a democracy .
i don' t have to justify why i own certain things .
i paid for them .
wrong !
we live in a capitalist dictatorship .
you stole everything you possess .
i can afford more because i work more .
i had the right ideas at the right time .
besides ...
i' m not the only one .
everyone get the same chances .
a real contender , aren' t you ?
in southeast asia , many people work 13 , 14 hours per day .
but they don' t have villas .
they earn 30 euros per month .
they might have good ideas , too .
but they can' t even pay for a bus ticket to the next town .
sorry i wasn' t born in southeast asia .
but you can still help make life bearable there .
the first world could cancel the third world' s debts .
that' s only 0 . 01 % of the gnp !
that would collapse the world' s financial system .
you want them poor !
it' s the way to control them .
make them sell their raw goods . at dirt cheap prices ...
what do you know ?
like you didn' t cancel jule' s debt .
that' s absurd !
no .
it' s the basic rule of the system .
suck others dry ...
it stops them from reacting .
that' s not true .
sure , things need improvement ...
environmental protection , raising producer prices ...
but the system won' t change .
why not ?
yes , why not ?
the nature of man is to want to be better than others .
in every group , a leader emerges quickly .
plus , most people are happy only when buying something new .
happy ?
think they are happy , hardenberg ?
look around .
get out of that company car ...
walk on the street !
anyone look happy ?
or more like scared animals ?
look into their living rooms .
all glued to the tv ...
listening to chick zombies ... speaking of a happiness long gone .
drive around town .
you' il see all the filth , the overcrowding ...
the masses in department stores ...
up and down , like robots on escalators .
nobody knows anybody .
they think happiness is an inch away .
but it' s unreachable , because you stole it .
that' s how it is .
you know perfectly well .
but i have news for you , executive ...
the system is overheated .
we' re just forerunners .
your time is almost over .
swim in you shit technology , but others are full of rage .
the rage of children living in slums , watching american action films .
that' s one part .
let' s see ...
mental illness is rising .
serial killers , shattered souls , senseless violence ...
you can' t sedate them with game shows and shopping .
the antidepressants won' t work forever either .
the people have had enough of you shit system .
i admit some of what you say is true .
but i' m the wrong scapegoat .
i play the game , but i didn t make up the rules .
it s not who invented the gun , but who pulls the trigger .
i' il be in the kitchen ...
washing dishes .
you know , it' s not that simple .
you don' t get off that easily .
it' s an island in the mediterranean .
practically no guards .
it' s the control center for europe s 13 main satellites .
if the transmitter is sabotaged , every tv screen in europe will go black .
there' s a fairly simple way .
i came up with it myself .
it' s easier than you think .
can i have a toke ?
i thought people like you hated dope heads .
people like me ?
yeah , people like you .
you think i was born this way ?
you probably weren' t loved enough as a child .
i don' t agree with you what you re doing , but your arguments ...
they remind me of another time .
give us a history lesson !
well , we did make history .
68 was a wild time .
i looked different then .
long curly hair ... old leather jacket , bell bottom pants ...
always a cap ...
a true rebel .
must have been long ago !
turbulent times ...
i was one of the leaders of the sds .
rudi dutschke was a good friend of mine .
who was chairman ?
k. d. wolf , karl dietrich wolf .
number 2 ?
his brother , frank wolf .
this morning was a far cry for revolt .
yeah ... it' s been a while ...
30 years ago .
we would have liked to get hold of a big shot like me .
and today , here i am !
pretty funny .
i don' t want to kiss up to you .
and i don' t think it' s right what you' re doing to me .
but your idealism ...
i can respect that .
morning .
everything ok ?
yes , fine .
pass me the jam , please .
this one .
can i have some bread ?
it' s in my interest that things go problem free .
so i have a suggestion .
i must make a call before 16 : 00
our cleaning woman mustn' t go in the house .
or she' il see the window .
there' s no network .
and cell phones can be traced .
i' il drive him down to the village .
there' s a phone booth .
he' il run away .
if he tries , i' il shoot him in the leg .
that won' t be necessary .
i won' t run away .
i won' t scream for help .
i don' t have a secret code with the maid , in case of kidnapping .
and i have to call my wife .
if not , she' il make a fuss .
peter , can we talk ?
what' s that about ?
just a gas pistol i bought .
it' s not loaded and it' s broken .
it looks like real to a cop .
jule called in the middle of the night .
so i brought it with me .
it sounded like an emergency .
we could forget all that business about the accident .
i could draw up a document to end it .
i don' t think this phone thing is going to work .
us three with a 50 year old ...
forget it .
the streets are dead at noon .
ok ?
and if he screams ?
he won' t . not with my gun in his side .
we have no choice ...
the maid can' t go inside .
there' s not just the whole in the window .
come on .
but give me the gun .
i' il do it .
i didn' t bother with it because i' m always on the move .
i gave it to my lawyer .
it was business as usual for him .
nobody knew to what extent it would affect someone .
you think i' m the weakest link here ?
think i' il buy all your bullshit ?
but this is about more than the damn accident !
where are the keys ?
check in my jacket .
don' t do anything stupid .
it' s mr. hardenberg ...
hello mrs. rose .
yes , thank you .
no need to come today .
i came home earlier to work in peace .
i have some business to finish .
please come next wednesday .
i' il call you on tuesday .
good , same to you .
thank you .
bye .
now my wife ?
yes .
it' s me .
i had ...
hold on ...
a water pipe burst last night .
it was a big mess .
i had to call a plumber .
no ... everything is fine now .
but i couldn' t call before .
yes , on monday .
at least , i hope on monday ...
i' il call you .
kisses from me .
bye .
good ...
you' re a good liar .
it' s a sauna in there .
bad cell phone reception .
yeah , my son is in withdrawal .
alright , let' s go .
you heard ...
drive .
i guess it s been a while ...
since you did your own wash .
how can someone with your past live the way you do ?
you must have had ideals .
under 30 and not liberal , no heart .
over 30 and still liberal , no brain .
yeah , right .
but i don' t believe that crap .
it' s the standard excuse of guys like you .
it happened slowly , gradually . you hardly notice it .
one day , you abandon your old car .
you want a dependable car , with air conditioning , a warranty .
you get married , raise a family , buy a house ...
the kids need a good education .
that costs money ...
security !
you create endless debts , so you need a career to pay them .
so you do like they do .
then one day , to your surprise at the polls ...
you vote conservative .
who made this great pasta ?
me ..
respect .
thanks .
who cooks at your house ?
your wife ?
mrs. schwarz .
our cook .
before , i used to love to cook .
for my wife and i , the others in the commune .
like big parties .
how many where you ?
we were 6 .
rolf , bernard , i ,
lizzy , gabi , my wife .
first , rolf and gabi were together .
then , bernd and gabi , then lizzy and me .
then bernd and lizzy ...
then lizzy and my wife for a while ...
it wasn' t just a political movement .
we had fun .
free love ...
but i don' t have to tell you three .
you skip .
skip again .
i' il draw 2 .
funny .
i pass .
i don' t care .
you make the rules .
yes , i do .
when i was little ... with my friends ... we played house with dolls ...
it was so real for them .
they were so into it .
i was never able to forget they were only dolls .
i always felt like ...
more of a watcher than a player .
you know ?
i still feel like that .
in real life .
it' s the matrix .
if you see it , you can' t be living in it .
neither can i.
good morning .
someone has to grocery shop .
we' re out of coffee , wine ...
no more food , no more toilet paper ...
i can' t anymore .
it' s your turn .
i' il go .
i' il go with you .
there' s no more dope !
ask in the store !
hardi , how about a game of cards ?
awesome .
let' s go in .
it' s cold .
i thought ... money would bring freedom .
on the contrary .
you' re burdened with responsibility .
sometimes i feel like i' m in jail .
stop moaning .
isn' t 3 million a year enough compensation ?
i don' t know what to do with the money .
give it to those who need it .
with your annual salary you could save 1000 persons from starvation .
sounds corny , but it' s true .
i could do that .
but only once .
so do it !
to be honest , peter ...
i' ve thought of giving it all up .
just sell everything , move to the countryside ...
live modestly with my wife , both of us work as teachers ..
like when we were students .
poor but happy .
we were in love .
when you talked about free love , why mention the three of us ?
don' t know it ?
you bought them anyway !
they are disgusting .
they are for hardenberg .
you two got something going ?
have you lost it ?
kiss my ass !
this is your shit .
i' m out of here .
peter , i m sorry !
sorry for what ?
it just happened .
i fell in love .
good , then i can go .
you don' t love me anymore .
you bastard !
what were you thinking , man ?
we hit it off , sorry .
hit it off ?
just like that ?
not " just like that " .
we got to know each other .
i thought we were friends .
we are friends .
i trusted you !
you told me to help her !
help her , not fuck her .
asshole !
coffee ?
no , thanks .
can i help you ?
no , forget it .
i' m going to lie down .
i' m a little tired .
the keys !
we screwed up .
kidnapping hardenberg was wrong .
we did it to save our own asses , not the world .
i guess this is it .
thanks for driving me home .
don' t worry about the cops .
wait !
your sweater .
here .
this is for you .
waiver of debt .
i won' t ruin your life .
what' s wrong ?
nothing .
after what i did , i can' t make demands .
it s over .
talk like that , and you' re one of them .
it' s not the jule thing that hurt .
it s that you take me for an idiot .
if i pocket a rolex , that' s not an insult to our case .
i believe in it , man .
us three ...
that' s more important than stuffy bourgeois ethics .
the best ideas survive .
come on .
some people never change .
