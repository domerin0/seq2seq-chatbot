there are an estimated 8 million people in the five boroughs of new york .
12 million in the greater metropolitan area .
there are almost 10 million telephone exchange lines .
over 50 phone services .
3 million new yorkers are cell phone users .
it used to be a mark of insanity to see people talk to themselves .
now it' s a mark of status .
and speed dial is quickly replacing the drop of a coin .
despite increased usage of cellular devices ... ... an estimated 4 . 5 million residents and 2 million visitors ... ... still utilize pay phones on a regular basis .
this is the telephone booth at 53rd and 8th ... ... perhaps the last vestige of privacy on manhattan ' s west side .
it is the last booth of its type , still in regular operation .
up to 300 calls daily originate here .
this location has been burglarized 41 times in the last six months .
verizon has scheduled this structure to be torn down ... ... and replaced with a kiosk as of 8 a . m . tomorrow .
hardly two blocks away ... ... meet the man who is to be the final occupant of that booth .

i don' t think so .
gentleman occupying phone booth , 53rd , between broadway and 8th .
it' s a mistake .
what am i supposed to do with the pie ?
it' s all paid for .
there' s a homeless guy around the block .
give him the pizza and say " you can turn away , but you can' t make it go away .
he' il think i' m trying to poison him .
they always get that idea .
get off the fucking pizza , all right ?
that language is uncalled for .
holy shit !
i' m sorry .
please return to sender .
fuck off .
here you go , $5 .
eat the pizza yourself .
you look like you could use a good meal .
hello .
pam , could you believe some nut case just tried to deliver me a pizza ?
why are you always in the same phone booth , same time , every day ?
well , it' s quitting time , right ?
thank god , we were mobbed today .
so how' s your day ?
it' s getting better by the minute , sweetheart .
who' s the most famous person you publicized today ?
you .
really ?
i told a few columnists mel gibson was looking for actresses for his film .
and i said the possibilities were cameron diaz , julia roberts ... ... and my favorite client , you .
you didn' t really do that .
first step toward being noticed is being mentioned .
i just got out of a conference at the city hotel .
i was thinking you could come down .
there are a couple of people and a few martinis i' d like to introduce you to .
stu , i ...
listen , pam .
pam .
pam .
it' s about time we talked about your career .
come on .
i feel awful but i promised my scene partner that i would rehearse for class .
we' re doing a scene from " jerry maguire .
i' m playing rene zellweger' s part .
that' s great .
look , i rescheduled a meeting to see you ... ... but i guess i can reschedule it back .

isn' t it funny ?
you hear a phone ring , and it could be anybody ... ... but a ringing phone has to be answered , doesn' t it ?
what ?
i hope you realize how you' ve hurt my feelings .
who the fuck is this ?
don' t think about leaving that phone .
wrong number , pal .
it was a perfectly delicious pizza .
you' re certainly going to wish you had accepted it .
naturally , this is part of the gag .
the pizza bit .
that was funny shit .
well , its purpose was to keep your strength up for what' s coming next .
what' s coming next is i' m hanging up .
oh , no , you won' t .
you' re going to learn to obey me .
obey you ?
who is this ?
someone who enjoys watching you .
watching me ?
yes , i love the suit you' re wearing today .
black on raspberry sorbet .
very italian .
where ... ?
where are you ?
there are hundreds of windows out there .
why don' t you check them out ?
so , what am i doing now ?
you' re scratching your head .
now you' re brushing your hair back .
that' s not very nice , stu .
did you call me stu ?
who' s stu ?
i don' t know any stu .
why , do you prefer stuart ?
a lot of people in this neighborhood know me .
stuart shepard , 1326 west 51st street , third floor , front .
go mind fuck some other guy , pal .
i know pamela mcfadden too .
it' s not in your best interest to disconnect me .
someone could get hurt .
what' s the matter , stu ?
if you' re some fucked up , failed actor i wouldn' t handle ... ... or some prick intern i fired , i will hunt you down and i will crush you .
you will never work in this town .
i can turn people into gods ... ... and i can turn you into a total fucking loser if you weren' t one already .
do you hear me ?
am i upsetting you ?
hello .
oh , you think i' m gonna , what ?
pay you off or something ?
tell me what you want .
now you want to talk to me .

what the ... ?
the callback feature cannot be activated ...
motherfucker .
tell me what you want .
i want your complete attention .
are you an actor ?
yes .
one of your pathetic failed ones .
it' s tough when you' re not known .
tell me about it .
you don' t have to hunt me and crush me .
i can' t get work in this town as it is .
i' ve done some off broadway , some off manhattan plays , but that dried up .
now i wait tables , clean toilets , anything to make the rent .
i' m a walking clich .
i can help you .
i can get you auditions .
auditions ?
you' re not an agent .
you' re a publicist .
yeah , but i have contacts .
i know agents .
i can get you an audition .
really ?
yeah .
well , there is someone i' d like you to call .
name it .
try the number you dialed when you first got into the booth .
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
no ?
lucky you then , because i wrote it down .
i can see every number you pressed .
let' s see if pam is still at work .
no .
then i guess i' il have to do it .
look , don' t !
too late .
it' s already ringing .
i' il put her on speaker so you can hear .
you' re fucking kidding me .
stu , i never kid .
hello .
well , hello , pam .
hi , who' s this ?
it' s a good friend of stu' s .
and he hasn' t got many .
you know stu ?
i know he lies .
who is this ?
don' t worry about that .
stu' s listening in .
he can hear what we' re saying about him .
stu , is that true ?
are you there ?
pam , hang up the goddamn phone !
she can' t hear you , stu .
pam , i' m afraid stu hasn' t been totally honest with you .
what do you mean ?
don' t do this .
stu has been lying to you .
pam , hang up .
now , why would a man who has a cell phone ... ... call you every day from a phone booth ?
because he said it' s quiet .
pam , that' s just stupid .
it' s because his wife checks his cell phone bills .
no record of his calls to you .
jesus christ .
he said he wasn' t married .
oh , he' s married .
her name is kelly .
i' ve never seen her but she sounds lovely .
why do you think he invites you to the city hotel ?
cheap rooms for cheap girls .
asshole .
he' s telling you all this so you' il sleep with him .
he' s lying , pam .
don' t listen .
i know that , okay ?
i may be from montana , but we have men there also .
i wasn' t planning on sleeping with him .
i just don' t know a lot of people here right now .
and he' s cute and he said that he would help me .
you never asked me if i was married .
he' s never made anyone a star .
bye .
hello ?
back to you , stu .
gotta hit this trick before the next bitch takes my score .
go away .
go away ?
hang up the phone , nigga .
this motherfucker , you don' t eyeball me .
bitch .
why are you doing this ?
did i ever harm you ?
did i ... ?
now , let' s call kelly .
she' s not home .
oh , but i' m sure she' s at the shop on columbus .
how the fuck do you know all this shit ?
speed dial her .
press " auto one . " that' s her button .
what am i supposed to say ?
why don' t you try the truth ?
you' re cheating .
i' m not cheating on kelly .
i never have .
then what do you call it ?
look , you' re a guy ... ... sometimes you want to know it' s a possibility .
it' s like having a beautiful home ... ... but you still dream of that quick vacation .
you know , some nice hotel room with a great view , maybe a pool .
it' s just a fantasy .
you never leave home .
do you hear what i' m saying ?
kelly is a home and pam is a motel .
i' m sure they' il both appreciate that .
fuck you .
hey , that kind of language is uncalled for .
you can' t take up the whole booth .
this here' s my business .
this is not the only phone in new york .
it' s the only one on 8th avenue that' s working .
bullshit !
go in a restaurant , but get lost .
motherfucker , this is my phone .
get ...
goddamn it , man !
you done made me hurt my dick hand .
i' m sure you' re just as good with the other hand .
yeah , go away .
i' il be back , motherfucker .
i will be back , bitch .
get out of my way !
i was worried for you .
i thought she was gonna put an eye out with that hand .
whoever you are , you' re obviously a very intelligent man .
i know what stress does .
it' s all i can do from going crazy myself .
you' re calling me crazy ?
no , you' re going through a difficult time .
look , please don' t call my wife .
let me give you my office number .
we' il talk .
i know a reasonable photographer who will do some headshots .
stu , do you really think that i' m an actor ?
i' m not an actor .
i have no use for you , stu .
none .
i would just like you to tell kelly the truth about yourself .
so are you going to call kelly and tell her about pam ?
or do i have to ?
no !
jesus , no .
i' m doing it .
feeling kind of nervous , stu ?
hello .
hold it to the receiver so i can hear .
stu ?
yeah .
where are you ?
i' m in a phone booth .
baby , i just got this call from this guy who said you' d be calling me ... ... from a booth to tell me something important .
there' s a lot of prank calling going on today , baby .
tell her you invite women ...
shut up .
... to have drinks at discreet hotels .
i' m not talking to you , baby .
someone' s got company .
who' s that woman ?
bitch got a cell phone !
some hooker is trying to use the phone .
he just called me a hooker .
are you sure there' s nothing wrong ?
we are escorts .
escorts .
tell her you want to sleep with other women .
there is this person and he' s saying things about me .
things that might not be true .
and if he calls you ...
get the fuck out of here before i call the cops !
honey , i want to sleep with other women .
look , kelly , whatever he says , don' t believe him .
i haven' t done anything .
only because pam had to rehearse .
shut the fuck up !
stu , i don' t know what you' re talking about , but you' re scaring me .
i' m sorry , baby .
can you just come over to the store so we can talk in person ?
i feel kind of weird .
yeah .
look , i' il try .
don' t worry .
come on !
yeah , bitch !
i love you too .
" i love you .
get out of here before i have you deported to jersey .
you' re a fucking ass !
and you' re a dirty skank .
what are you gonna do about it ?
your mama is a skank , bitch !
you didn' t tell your wife the truth , did you , stu ?
and you can tell she really loves you .
must be nice to have a pretty girl care for you .
why screw up her life ?
she never did you harm .
everybody does harm .
that' s it .
this mind fuck is over .
stu , if you hang up , i will kill you .
what are you going to do about it with your goddamn binoculars ?
i never said i had binoculars .
i have a highly magnified telescopic image of you .
now what kind of device has a telescopic sight mounted on it ?
what ?
you mean like a rifle ?
a. 30 caliber bolt action 700 with a carbon one modification ... ... and a state of the art hensholdt tactical scope .
and it' s staring straight at you .
yeah , how' s my fucking hair ?
at this range , the exit wound ought to be about the size of a small tangerine .
nice try , pal .
go to hell .
now , doesn' t that just torque your jaws ?
i love that .
you know , like in the movies just as the good guy ... ... is about to kill the bad guy , he cocks his gun .
now why didn' t he have it cocked ?
because that sound is scary .
it' s cool , isn' t it ?
look , you shoot a gun here and there' il be pandemonium .
do you hear me ?
there will be cops all over this block .
do you think so ?
let' s see .

no , i have plenty of reasons , and you keep giving me more .
shall i take care of him ?
no !
no .
shit , no .
it would be so easy .
here .
here .
stu , you just gave that gentleman $ 10 to walk away .
you saved his life .
you do have a sensitive side .
how much to let me go ?
let' s see how sensitive you really are .
i' m aiming at you right now .
can you feel it , the heat of it ?
come now , stu , you can feel it .
concentrate .
concentrate .
take a look at where i' m going .
you' re doing so much better than the others .
you read about the german porn king shot 10 days ago ... ... at 38th and 8th ?
he thought he was an artist and wouldn' t admit he was just a pedophile .
believe me , he had plenty of chances to come clean .
you must have read about the corporate executive shot at 47th and 10th .
what you didn' t read was that he cashed in all of his stocks ... ... just before the bottom fell out , while all the little guys lost everything .
now if he had been willing to make amends ... ... share the money , things might have been different .
please , tell me , where am i aiming now ?
below the shoulder .
which one ?
the right shoulder .
love to love you too , baby !
that' s phenomenal , stu .
you' re doing so much better than the others .
what do you remember about those killings , stu ?
i don' t know .
well , you think of yourself as a smart guy , stu .
try .
they got shot .
i don' t know , all right ?
okay , i' il give you a hint .
wallets , watches , everything was left on their bodies .
because they weren' t robberies .
they were executions .
they didn' t have to be .
what did i do to deserve this ?
why me ?
if you have to ask , then you' re not ready to know yet .
right here .
shit .
come on .
jesus .
you , in the booth .
come on .
now what ?
you got any idea how much pain you' re making in my life ?
hey , look at me .
look , i hear you !
look me in the eye .
hang up the phone and walk away .
don' t do it .
i got my own problems .
i' m your problem .
you know why ?
my girls keep yapping at me , " leon , he won' t share the phone .
leon , he told us to fuck off .
we' re gonna make you nuts unless you make him get off the fucking phone .
i' m trying to run a fucking business .
i sympathize , but i can' t get off the call .
no , you don' t understand me .
i got the g string union here .

i don' t want your money .
i want you to hang up the phone and get out . $ 120 .

yeah , now talk to him like that !
jesus christ .

i' m not going anywhere , am i ?
if you had dealt with the man decently , this might not have been necessary .
look , i offered him money .
i offered him my watch .
but not your respect , which is what he really wanted .
you were dismissive like you dismissed the nice pizza guy .
you are guilty of inhumanity to your fellow man .
i' m not guilty of a goddamn thing .
take responsibility for what you' ve done , stu .
be a man .
i love this fucking spin .
you shoot the guy , and i' m fucking responsible ?
well , looked that way from up here .
i don' t know what i did to you but whatever it was , i' m glad .
i wish it had been worse .
i wish you died !
yes , finally some honesty .
just tell me who you are .
no one you' d ever notice .
i don' t run in your circles .
and what is it you do ?
i watch .
you watch ?
yes , well , what else is there to do ... ... when life turns on you and you' ve retreated into some small room ?
you look out your window .
you see people come in and out of this phone booth .
the same ones every day .
you make up names for them .
you imagine their stories .
but eventually , you get tired of imagining and follow one of them .
and you hear all of his lies .
and you decide that his sins should be punished .
some guy shouting into a cell phone full of self importance isn' t gonna notice me .
but i noticed that german porn king , and i noticed that corrupt executive .
and i noticed you , stu .
i' m flattered .
operator 553 .
what is your emergency ?
will you please respond ?
what was so interesting about a guy in a phone booth on 53rd and 8th ?
the stu show .
better than tv .
look , how' d i get so lucky to be picked up by a killer with a rifle ? !
you had it made .
kelly at home , pam on the side .
i saw pam once .
i followed her to her restaurant .
lovely .
life has given you more than your fair share , stu .
but it appears you don' t appreciate it .
look , look , listen , appearances can be deceiving .
i may look confident , but i' m really , actually just crying out for help !
help !
you know ?
i' m trying to help you , stu , but you won' t help yourself .
fuck .
what' s the matter , stu ?
you shot me !
it' s time you learn , stu .
deception can' t go unrewarded .
deception !
what fucking deception ?
" are you in need of immediate police or medical response ?
shit .
you bugged the fucking booth .
that' s how you knew .
that' s how you knew about pam .
you picked the wrong person to lie to .
look , i didn' t pick you .
it must have been your flashy suit that attracted me .
i get fucked on account of my clothes ?
that why you killed leon ?
i didn' t kill leon because of the way he dressed .
and those other two guys as well ?
did they dress too nice ?
you must feel really expensive when you walk out the door .
all right , here come the cops .
what are you gonna do ?
run ?
no , i' m not a coward like some people i know .
you can get away if you run now .
you' il blame me for leon .
no , no , i' il confess i shot him with my fucking phone .
well , then i urge you to keep one thing in mind , stu .
take a look at your chest .
you saw how accurate i can be , how lethal .
kill me now , and you give yourself away .
not with a silencer .
it would take these guys ... ... the rest of the day to figure out it wasn' t one of their own men that did it .
you can be shot 41 times for pulling out your wallet .
throw down your weapon and come out with your hands raised .
ignore him .
yeah , what if they open fire ?
they won' t .
look around you , stu .
do you see the tourists with the video cameras ?
the ones hoping the cops will blow you away ... ... so they can sell the tape " to " the most gory police shootouts ?
don' t worry , they' il keep the police on their best behavior .
so long as you don' t take hostile action , you should be safe .
safe ?
you call this safe ?
i got a whole fucking precinct here with guns pointed my way .
with both hands raised , moving slowly , step out of the booth .
if we see any signs of a weapon we will respond .
you won' t because there isn' t any !
put down the phone and raise your hands !
look , i can' t .
i' m on an important call .
verify this information for me .
the guy in the booth shot that guy over there ... ... and stuck around to make a phone call .
yeah , that' s what the hookers are saying .
all right , give me the horn .
sir !
i' m ordering you to fully comply .
i' m busy , all right .
come back later .
very good , stu .
step out of the booth ... ... and raise your hands .
i am giving you an order .
i give the orders here , stu , don' t i ?
this guy is looking for us to kill him , captain .
suicide by a cop ?
well , that' s not gonna happen .
get that body out of here fast .
somebody get the body .
tell the ambulance to get the body .
thousands of people die every day , but you put one dead body ... ... in the middle of a busy street and it makes people crazy .
look at these guys .
you can smell the fear .
ten cops .
this reminds me of nam .
vietnam ?
yes , vietnam .
i was too young to go , but i' ve seen pictures .
well , pictures can' t do it , stu .
you can' t imagine the fear , the stench .
napalm charred bodies , children leaving grenades in your boots .
then you got blamed for the war .
i came home and people spit on me .
yeah , this country owes you an apology .
look , i just had this vision of you , of a kid , coming back from the war ... ... inured to the killing , not able to get work , isolated .
i think that could be made into an affecting story ... ... and , you know , one that everyone understands .
and i think cops are on the side of vets .
you are pathetic , stu .
why don' t you wake up ?
napalm charred bodies ?
i' d have to be 50 to be in that war !
stop fucking with my head , please !
i' m gonna go talk to him .
shouldn' t we wait on the esu negotiator ?
they could take 20 minutes .
i' m not gonna take a chance on this one .
i' m gonna handle this .
sir !
i' m taking out my weapon .
putting my weapon down on the car .
the captain' s going in .
i' m not armed .
yeah , neither am i.
my name is ramey .
captain ed ramey .
all right .
what' s yours ?
i don' t want to be friends .
i don' t know .
it looks like you could use a friend right now .
tell him you' ve already got a friend .
i already got a friend .
is that who you' re talking to on the phone ?
look , i just want to hear your side of it .
that' s all .
i ain' t got no side of it , and i didn' t shoot anybody .
you see a fucking gun anywhere ?
look .
it' s in your back pocket !
i see it !
he been ...
sir , do you have the weapon in your pocket ?
no .
i got a cell phone and i got cigarettes .
i got no fucking weapon .
then what are you doing in a phone booth making calls ?
you want to see it ?
here .
hey !
don' t reach for that !
hold your fire !
i don' t need to see it .
i know what' s there .
i got plenty of witnesses over here who saw you use it .
they didn' t see it because it didn' t happen !
shut them up !
he' s dead , but it didn' t happen ?
then who did it ?
mustn' t tell him , stu .
i don' t know .
you were the closest one to him .
you must' ve saw it happen .
help me .
no .
this guy is getting on my nerves .
look , stay the fuck out of this .
who do you keep talking to on the phone ?
nobody .
your friend , your parent , your lover ?
who ?
careful , stuart .
careful .
my psychiatrist .
excellent .
i should' ve thought of that .
i see .
what' s this doctor' s name ?
it would be really helpful to us if we knew .
he says not to tell you , all right ?
it' s privileged information .
very good , stuart .
see , now you' re having fun .
yeah , whatever you fucking say .
i respect your right to privacy .
i' ve been through therapy myself .
the department provided it for me .
i know it' s not good form for a cop to be saying that , but sometimes ... ... you know , circumstances , stress ...
i had issues .
i lost my marriage over it .
tell him not to come any closer .
don' t come any closer .
stop there .
go back a few steps .
go back to where you were !
okay .
no problem .
that' s right .
so you got some intimacy issues .
i got those too .
all i want to know is , what happened , man ?
tell him to read you your rights .
i want you to read me my rights .
stop asking questions .
you have the right to remain silent .
you have the right to an attorney .
if you cannot afford one , an attorney will be provided for you .
all right ?
so now , can you at least give me your first name ?
just your first name .
don' t tell him .
it' s my right not to have any first name .
no gun , no name .
that' s right .
you' re highly underprivileged .
demand your lawyer .
and go get my lawyer too .
all right ?
i want an attorney brought down here to negotiate my surrender .
just brilliant , stu .
i understand that , but ... ... it' s gonna be difficult to get a lawyer to come and risk his life .
once you hand over the gun ...
how can i ?
you won' t let me put my hand in my pocket ?
we' il take it out for you .
all you have to do ... ... is step out with your hands raised .
nothing will happen to you .
it' s not gonna work .
stu , stu .
what ?
ask him a question .
ask him if his wife got tired of sleeping with him .
i ...
fuck .
i can' t do that .
oh , sure you can , stu .
ask him if he couldn' t get it up , if he couldn' t satisfy her .
are you gonna step out of the booth ?
i can' t .
no .
you' re not stepping out of the booth ?
ask him .
is that a no ?
ask him !
both your lives depend on it .
sir ?
captain , you couldn' t satisfy your wife sexually ?
excuse me ?
ask him if he abuses himself now ?
does he masturbate on lonely nights ?
fuck .
for god' s sake !
say it !
say it or i will blow him away !
so do you whack off now ?
hey !
i' m gonna see about that lawyer for you , okay ?
yes .
just relax .
stu , i think you hurt his feelings .
i wanna know who' s on that phone .
i want a techie here .
i need to talk to somebody about that phone .
do you think we went too far , stuart ?
should we give ourselves up ?
maybe i' d like someone to negotiate my surrender .
i' m sure we can work that out .
i won' t just spill my guts to anyone .
could you get me national news ?
i mean , you' ve got connections , right ?
sure .
could you get larry king down here ?
why the fuck would larry king come here ?
because you' re friends .
who else could you get , huh ?
could you get tom brokaw ?
how about dan rather ?
diane sawyer ?
look , i , i , i don' t know .
they' re busy .
i , i , i busy .
how about mike wallace ?
ted koppel ?
peter jennings ?
katie couric ?
al roker ?
anybody ?
no !
nobody .
face it , stu , you' re smalltime .
and you' ve got a credibility problem .
don' t fucking worry about my credibility !
all right ?
what about yours ?
look , it' s our friends from channels two and five .
your local news , stuart .
you couldn' t do this for your clients if your life depended on it .
but me , i' ve made you famous .
stick your head out so they can get a better angle on you .
they' re here to cover me dying .
how ungrateful .
those cameras will make the police very careful .
so come on , smile a little for them .
can you tap into that phone call ?
should be no problem .
except ... ... we' il need a warrant if he' s on the line with his shrink .
fuck that .
i' m not gonna jeopardize this on a technicality .
look , tracing , that' s not a violation , right ?
as long as we don' t listen in .
okay , this is what i want you to do .
i want you to find who he' s talking to and their current location .
all right ?
we get that ?
i want somebody to find out what' s going on .
look across the street and see what everybody in new york is looking at .
you' re the man , stuart .
you' re the center of attention .
abc , cbs , cnn , upn ... you' re gonna hit the whole alphabet , stu .
i' il be forgotten about in a week .
no one ever remembers the names of the victims .
it' s the killers that get the cover of " time " magazine .
right ?
think about it .
you' d be famous .
ted bundy , john wayne gacy ... ... fucking jeffrey dahmer .
name a victim .
you can' t .
anyway , i don' t deserve to be the center of attention .
it ought to be you they' re covering . " that attention would embarrass me " .
i know exactly the spin to put on this .
how terror inspires your creativity ?
listen , this could be a media frenzy , all right ?
you' d get barbara walters ... ... i mean , larry king if you still wanted him .
that approach seems predicated upon me surrendering without killing you .
listen , we can make you sympathetic , sit with a writer , bang out a book .
you know , movie of the week .
get america on your side .
all right , you killed leon because he was gonna kill me .
you killed leon to protect me .
all right ?
in a city where nobody looks out for anybody , you took a stand .
i' m your best witness .
so you want me to trust you to get me out of this ?
yes , i do .
i want you to trust me .
trust me .
stu , you must think i' m crazy .
oh , shit .
here comes braman .
i' il take care of him .
hey .
should' ve waited for me to initiate contact with the suspect .
i established a rapport .
let you know if i need help .
are you grandstanding for tv cameras ?
or do you want to leave this to a professional ?
until a professional gets here , i' il handle it .
you' re a funny guy .
all right , you get somebody else killed , it' s on your head .
got it ?
this is what i want to do , okay ?
this is the city hotel here .
i want three guys in the lobby here .
and five sharpshooters up here .
see if you can get me two in the subway .
what the fuck ?
not going to answer it ?
i can' t .
i can' t reach for the phone .
the cops will think it' s a gun .
i' il bet it' s kelly .
she' s probably heard what you did .
she' s sick with worry .
i' m not gonna make her feel any better , am i ?
well , you could ask her to forgive you , stuart .
you could confess your sins and beg for absolution , come clean .
you' re in this position because you' re not telling the truth .
i' m in this position because you got a gun !
no .
stuart , that is the sin of spin .
avoidance and deception .
you' re being given a chance here to make things right .
now , talk to her .
look , i can' t .
please .
i am telling you to answer that phone !
excuse me !
excuse me !
you can' t cross in front of here !
answer it !
look , i can' t .
please .
don' t make me hurt you !
talk to your wife !
it' s not her calling .
how can you be so sure ?
it' s you .
it' s you , you miserable fuck !
damn , you got me !
you continue to impress .
you could shoot me , but you want them to do it !
yes , well , that' s an option .
yeah .
captain .
yeah ?
this lady says the perp' s her husband .
here' s her id .
i couldn' t believe when i saw this .
who do you think he' s talking to ?
i don' t know .
i spoke to him earlier today and i told him ... ... that there was a man who called me .
a man ?
did this upset him , that you were talking to other men ?
yes , he did seem a little upset , but it' s , no ...
it' s not like that .
i didn' t even know who this guy was .
who' s his psychiatrist ?
he doesn' t have one .
that you know of .
i' ve been with him three years , married for one .
i' d know if he was in therapy .
i wish to god he had been .
i saw somebody after my divorce .
it kept me from picking up a gun , doing something i would regret .
look , stu didn' t kill anyone .
ma' am , under the circumstances ... ... you need to consider whether your husband is who you thought he was .
' cause according to these witnesses over here , he has a gun ... ... he has used that gun and let' s pray to god that he doesn' t use it again .
captain ?
if you can think of any dispute he' s having currently , please , tell me .
we' re clearing city hotel .
i can stage an assault unit within feet of the booth .
we' ve also got sharpshooters securing rooftop positions .
let me know when you' re in position .
absolutely .
what about that wire tap ?
we' re working on it .
you gotta hold tight a while , all right ?
yeah , no problem .
no problem .
okay .
mrs. shepard .
mrs. shepard .
does he like being called stuart or stu ?
stu .
call him stu .
stu .
okay .
come with me , please .
stu .
i have your wife with me .
that' s how you knew she wasn' t calling .
you deceived me .
stu !
she' s not my wife .
are you okay ?
can you just talk to me ?
yes , talk to her , stu .
look , she' s not my wife !
she' s some fucked up , failed actress i wouldn' t handle .
she' s stalking me !
you aren' t making this up ?
you are his wife , right ?
yes , here' s a photograph of us together .
i don' t know what he' s talking about .
stu .
listen to your wife .
she only wants what' s best for you .
she' s not my wife !
stu , nobody wants to hurt you .
we just want to know what happened .
yeah , very good .
go home , you fucking lunatic !
you hear me ?
go home !
please don' t make things worse .
just come out .
just do what they tell you to do .
your wife is a crazy actress stalker and you don' t know her .
that' s an interesting match .
get her out of here !
enough .
i don' t want to agitate this .
you out of your fucking mind ?
come on , get the woman out of here !
no .
i don' t know what' s going on .
he' s bleeding ...
we ...
we' re fine .
this morning everything was fine .
you just stay here .
just stay here , okay ?
okay .
i think she did some good .
you got a number of that lawyer ?
no , we don' t have a lawyer .
he asked for his lawyer to come negotiate his surrender .
well , we never needed one .
well , you need a good one now .
look , you' il do me best by staying near here .
okay ?
i' m gonna get your husband out alive .
i' m not going to let you fuck this up !
get mrs. shepard out of here .
you know , get her some coffee or something .
you' re gonna lose this guy .
you need some kind of redemption .
what are you seeing a shrink for ?
get the fuck out of my face !
don' t fucking touch me !
i' m not stepping down !
you okay ?
yeah , i' m fine .
you' d think she didn' t know she was being watched .
what ?
but beautiful women always know .
you talking about kelly ?
that false indifference , superior air ... ... it' s just a tease .
they want eyes on them .
why does she put on her makeup , do her hair , dress so nicely ?
not for her husband that she hardly ever sees .
no , it' s for somebody else to notice .
i notice .
what are you doing ?
stay away from her .
leave her alone .
i' m giving her what she wants .
i bet you' ve never looked at kelly the way i am right now .
don' t you dare fucking hurt her .
don' t i dare ?
i' m not the one who has hurt her , stuart .
what they can' t know is what we do to them in our minds .
right ?
you sick fuck !
the perfect violation .
leave her out of this .
how many times ... ... have you had sex with pam in that hotel bedroom in your head ?
would you really miss kelly if she was gone ?
that' s it .
not another word .
i' m not talking to you .
your choices put other people in jeopardy .
when are you gonna learn that ?
this is funny .
stuart , look uptown .
these geniuses are still at the juncture box trying to tap in .
only i have installed an encryption device at both ends of the line .
there' s no chance of a trap trace ... ... so now they' ve gotta try some fancy lojack instrument .
it' s really sad .
i hope you weren' t pinning your hopes on those morons .
truth is , i' m on a wireless a. d. s. with a cloned number .
it' il take a half an hour to find out i call forwarded through philadelphia .
and let me tell you , this will all be over before they can get a dial tone .
we can' t get a trace or break into the line .
it' s like a ball of rubber bands .
i knew there was something weird about this .
you keep working on it .
stu .
stuart , come on , you' re behaving like a child .
still gonna give me the silent treatment ?
hello .
stuart , don' t do this , please .
come on .
my sainted mother used to do this .
she used to dish this out .
stuart , please don' t do this .
stuart , you' re bringing back my unhappy childhood .
stuart , talk to me !
please , talk to me !
i can' t take it !
stu , please ... i' m kidding .
i had a very happy childhood .
hey , there' s our girl again .
i wasn' t planning on killing her ... ... but plans change .
just tell me what the fuck you want from me .
hello .
there you are .
i thought i was talking to myself again .
anything you want .
i' il do it .
just tell me .
tell kelly about the real stu , about your little motel .
and then you' il let us go ?
why not ?
kelly !
that' s a start .
baby !
hold her back !
hey !
talk to me !
grab her !
keep her back !
yes ?
i' m listening .
kelly , i called some woman .
every day .
every day .
i was attracted to this other woman .
and i called her and ...  i wanted to fuck her .
and i wanted to sleep with her .
no .
i wanted to fuck her .
say it .
say it !
and i wanted to fuck her .
i' m sorry .
whatever you did , i don' t care .
please , just come out of the booth .
okay ?
that' s all i did .
that' s all i did .
i' m sorry .
all right , i' ve done what you asked .
that' s it .
i' ve had enough of this .
i haven' t .
you said you' d let us go .
i changed my mind .
you miserable fuck .
you can' t do this .
you can' t do this to me .
look , i took all your shit .
i did everything you fucking asked .
you lied to me .
i' m done with this .
i' ve fucking had enough .
you can go fuck yourself !
later .
he hung up .
maybe they already got a trace .
esu , esu ?
i' m giving myself up !
he' s coming out !
heads up !
i want to see you toss away your weapon !
throw the weapon outside the booth !
stay where you are !
first , the weapon !
don' t hurt him !
please , don' t hurt him !
there' s no fucking gun !
stay right where you are !
i want you to turn around .
interlock your fingers behind your head .
okay ?
please give them the gun !
kelly , no !
get back !
kelly !
freeze !
get back !
get back !
get back !
okay !
okay !
i gotta answer it .
freeze !

please .
go ahead .

what the fuck are you doing ?
he' s coming out !
answer the phone .
you fucking coward .
hi , stu .
now , you' ve had your little tantrum and you said some things in anger ... ... that i am willing to forget .
get her back in the car !
i want her in the car .
if he' s not the shooter , then who the fuck is ?
captain , what the fuck is up with the phone calls ?
so can we start over ?
you lied .
you can' t know the pain of betrayal until you' ve been betrayed .
sniper in one of these buildings .
i want you to talk to esu .
i want you to get one of these guys , this building .
start looking up there from window to window till you find the perp .
okay ?
i want you to do it quickly , and i want you to do it quietly .
all right ?
where' s the esu sergeant ?
you said we could go .
you said you' d let us go .
relax , stuart .
nobody gets it right the first time .
you' ve done better than others .
you will get a chance to end this .
i' m just not finished yet .
yeah , well , i am .
there' s nothing keeping me .
besides the fear of death ?
i dive out and you' ve got one shot .
i' m gonna be dancing .
you think you can get me ?
i could go for some target practice .
one shot , they look for you .
second shot , you give yourself away .
go on , stuart , hang up !
trust your fate to friendly men in flak jackets with automatic weapons .
i' m sure you can patch up that little misunderstanding about the dead body .
cops can' t prove i killed anyone .
you had motive .
no weapon .
plenty of loudmouth witnesses .
no gun and i walk .
are you sure ?
yes !
yeah ?
you murder a guy and you forget where you stashed your gun ?
why don' t you lift the plastic ceiling panel and feel around ?
peekaboo !
what' s up next to the florescent bulb ?
check it out , stu .
cops see me reach for something , they' il blow me away .
there' s only one way to find out .
look , the slugs in that dead guy , they came from your rifle .
they' re not gonna match a handgun .
i' ve seen enough cop shows .
hollow points fragment on impact , stuart .
there' s nothing to match .
only there' s no gun up there .
don' t take my word for it .
see for yourself .
there are rounds left in it .
i totally couldn' t give a shit .
come on .
don' t disappoint me .
use your imagination .
you' d shoot me if you got the chance , wouldn' t you ?
with a big fucking smile on my face .
there' s the spirit .
now , what if i told you i was just above the theater , four floors up ?
see the pink curtains ?
there you go , stuart .
yes .
yoo hoo !
yoo hoo !
why would you do that ?
because it' s fun .
the odds are even now , stuart .
isn' t that what you wanted ?
you know where i am , and you have a gun .
if you have it in you , you can take me down .
fuck !
they' d kill me before i got a shot .
oh , you' re probably right .
i' m not really there anyway .
you would' ve just spoiled some nice lady' s curtains .
looks like someone watches the news .
who ?
the motel .
oh , god .
i think she could use a new headshot .
don' t !
then take down the gun .
look , this has nothing to do with her !
she has everything to do with this .
you' re here and she' s here because you called her .
now , take it down !
don' t make me hurt pam , stuart .
take down the gun !
hey , everybody , get ready .
hold on , hold on .
let' s just see what he does , all right ?
let' s see what he' s doing .
there' s nothing there .
nothing but your fingerprints on the finest cop killer money can buy .
come on , stu .
let' s see it .
fuck , no !
it' s staying there .
fine , then someone will have to take your place .
come on , stu , you' re in a perfect position .
how do you figure ?
you get to choose between them .
pamela or kelly ?
should i choose ?
one of them can take your place .
don' t do this !
you' ve got to be more in touch with your feelings .
i thought you only loved kelly !
it' s true !
but you lie to her .
it' s complicated .
then i' il uncomplicate it , stuart , by removing temptation .
i say pam .
no !
look , this isn' t pam' s fault .
this is all my fault !
she' s innocent !
ticktock , ticktock .
time' s running out .
okay , kelly , then .
you decide .
no , please !
come on , stu .
don' t you get the game yet ?
you' re a selfish guy .
pick one and save yourself .
blond or brunette ?
time' s running out .
you or them ?
kelly or pam ?
kelly or pam ?
come on , stu !
stop this .
i can' t take this anymore .
what are you doing ?
get up !
i was looking for my ring .
look ...  get up , stuart !
stand up and be a man .
you' re embarrassing yourself .
captain !
i got it .
listen .
the rifleman reports subject pulled a small , dark object out of his pocket .
all right .
you' re looking at a suicide on national fucking tv .
you gonna let me take this over ?
tell everybody to hold on , to hold their fire .
everybody hold .
stay ready , but hold .
stuart , you' re beginning to annoy me .
you can' t do this .
stu .
no more spinning , no more excuses .
what' re you doing ?
look , listen .
listen , please listen to me .
no more delays , stuart .
look ...
i' m on my knees begging you not to kill me .
i will if you keep up this pathetic spectacle .
excuse me !
he' s on the phone , talking .
from up in your high window , you could kill anyone .
yes , i know that , stuart .
all right , and ...
you could pick off any of the cops , with your rifle .
shut up and stand up !
look , why threaten kelly ?
you liked how she sounded on the phone at the store .
please don' t hurt her .
don' t fucking hurt my wife .
this doesn' t have to end with me shooting you .
you leave no choice .
now , get up !
all right .
okay , how does this end ?
tell me how this ends .
the stage is almost set .
people are gonna be eating dinner watching you die .
we got a sniper situation here .
what about that phone call to your store ?
i got a phone call this afternoon .
i think it was a prank call .
he told me stu would be calling me from a phone booth .
how long will it take to get a record of her calls ?
if he' s using that secure line , we won' t know more than now .
say he didn' t .
let' s assume he' s a human , makes mistakes like all of us .
i need to get that number .
i' ve been waiting for that number .
it was a guy .
he sounded like mid 30' s .
mrs. shepard ?
it would be safer if you got back in the car , okay ?
please get back in the car .
thank you .
i want you to divert incoming esu units to broadway and hold them there .
want me to clear the streets ?
yeah .
no , no , no .
i don' t want the sniper to be aware of any of our movements .
he' s already got position on us .
let' s not let him know we know too much , okay ?
hey , jonah .
yeah .
don' t look up .
get me sharpshooters looking at those windows .
you got it , captain .
i' m gonna buy us some time here .
all right .
stu !
it' s okay if i come out and talk to you for a second ?
i don' t know .
this guy is so lonely .
all he wants to do is talk .
you' re walking through a bad dream ... ... and you can' t wake up .
now he' s really testing my patience .
you wanna wake up , stu ?
i wanna , but i got issues i can' t talk about .
that your psychiatrist on the phone ?
yeah , yeah .
i' m paying him overtime .
that was pretty brave what you did .
i mean , admitting all that stuff to your wife .
it was liberating , right ?
should' ve been .
maybe if i could be more honest with my wife then ... ... i don' t know , something would' ve turned out different .
oh , please .
trust is the key .
you trust me , stu ? " get this man a seat on " oprah .
i wanna , but i got the issues i can' t talk about .
yes , lethal issues .
tell him to stay back .
look , don' t come any closer .
hey , i don' t wanna cause or make anything harder for you .
pam , ramey , kelly , people on the street , you' ve got lives in your hands .
i told you it' s a private conversation .
what the fuck do you want ?
i wanna let you know that it' s safe outside the booth .
it' s not .
it' s always , " get out of the booth !
i like it in the fucking booth !
all right ?
it' s my world .
this is my booth , and i' m not coming out .
all right ?
never .
we' re not gonna force you out ... ... because there could be some miscalculation ... ... and then i would never find out why this happened .
stu , i' m afraid .
i' m afraid that i' m gonna be standing by ... ... and my men are gonna shoot some guy ... ... and when we find out what' s in his hand , once we turn over his body ... ... and we see what he was threatening people with ...
we realize that it was just a little black bible .
or a cell phone .
don' t push me , stu .
i' m not gonna let that happen here .
i wanted to make a phone call .
one lousy call ... that' s enough , stu .
you got some bad news on that call ?
the worst .
i bet you want to jump off the edge .
i' ve been falling ever since .
i' m gonna push him over the edge .
just say the word .
it' s time to land .
when you hit bottom , you die .
i' m your safety net .
oh , please , say the word .
if i tell you what you wanna know , you' il die too .
exactly .
i' m going .
good .
but , stu , we put a call out to your lawyer .
your wife , she gave us the number .
and i got my best men working on bringing him down .
okay ?
that' s it .
the captain gets a bullet .
get out of here !
hear what i said , asshole ?
get out of here , go on , now !
go !
enough of this sideshow , stu .
your sins have caught up to you .
so this is all some religious thing ?
that explains it .
bible crazed killer picks on fashion obsessed pr guy .
tell me what you want , then .
what everyone wants ... ... for the bad guy to get what he deserves .
go for the gun .
kill myself ?
yes .
it would be a rare , unselfish act .
we got hostile action .
nothing is hostile until i say it is .
look , i can' t find it .
kelly , pam , bam !
bam !
all right !
look , i found it .
i got it .
then let' s see it .
let everyone see it .
the cops' il kill me .
yes .
you' re talking prime time material now .
all this shit just to watch me die ?
no .
to get you to do what' s right .
if you wanna save yourself , confess .
i already told kelly everything .
everything ?
no .
no more excuses and half truths , stuart .
you look out into those cameras and you bare your soul .
tv seems to help bring out the worst in people .
you should be fine .
how' re those techs doing ?
anything ?
no , not yet .
not yet .
we haven' t found your lawyer yet , stu .
but we' re getting close .
okay ?
stuart , i' m offering you a chance to redeem yourself .
come on , humble yourself in front of your loved ones ... ... and millions of strangers and me .
it' s do or die time .
what , you couldn' t find anyone worse than me ?
not a murderer or a child molester but a publicist ... ... who has fantasies about pretty little actresses .
who spends money on italian suits and dry cleaning ... ... so people think he' s important .
who doesn' t waste time being nice ... ... to people who are of no use to him .
these are my crimes ?
stuart , i know your crimes .
tell them .
i' ve never done anything for anybody ... ... who couldn' t do something for me .
i string along ... ... a kid with promises that i' il pay him money .
i keep him around because he looks up to me .
adam , if you' re watching , don' t be a publicist .
you' re too good for it .
i lie in person and on the phone .
i lie to my friends .
i lie to newspapers and magazines who sell my lies to more and more people .
i' m just a part of a big cycle of lies .
i should be fucking president .
i wear all this italian shit because underneath , i still feel like the bronx .
i think i need these clothes , and this watch .
my $2000 watch is a fake , and so am i.
i neglected the things i should' ve valued most .
i valued this shit .
i take off my wedding ring to call pam .
kelly , that' s pam .
somebody got a 20 on this pam ?
don' t blame her .
i never told her if i was married , and if i did ... ... she would' ve told me to go home .
kelly , looking at you now , i' m ashamed of myself .
i mean , i work so hard on this image , on stu shepard , the asshole ... ... who refers to himself in third person , that i only proved i should be alone .
i' ve been dressing up as something i' m not for so long ... ... i' m so afraid you won' t like what' s underneath .
but here i am .
i' m just flesh and blood and weakness .
i love you so fucking much .
i take off this ring because it only reminds me of how i' ve failed you .
and , i don' t wanna give you up .
i wanna make things better , but it may not be my choice anymore .
you deserve better .
you' re not gonna let me go .
no .
you never were .
i know a thing about lies .
i know a thing or two about liars as well .
then why the confession ?
i didn' t do it for you .
right there .
yeah , got that .
captain , captain .
17 ... ... at a hard line from the old barkley hotel .
you got a room ?
604 .
second window from the corner .
esu units holding .
bring them in from 52nd street .
cover the windows , doors , fire escape , every goddamn point of exit .
esu , esu , come in from the 52nd ...
stu !
your lawyer' s coming down now !
doors , fire escapes ...

at least you' il die with a clean conscience .
no , you' re the one that' s gonna die !
listen , you can hear them now .
they' re coming to get you .

because i sent them !
you can' t stop lying , can you ?
i can' t stop lying ?
they' re coming up the stairs .
they' re coming to get you .
look around .
that room' s getting smaller every second .
inch by inch !
you know what ?
it' s not gonna be any bigger than this fucking goddamn booth !
they' re in position , in position .
get them to move !
there' s nobody there .
there' s nobody there ?
they' re coming through that fucking door to put you out of your misery .
you got a couple seconds left .
what' re you gonna do ?
if this is true , i have to take someone with me , don' t i ?
since kelly is the most important thing in your life , i' il take her .
then take me !

this is about me !
i' m the fucking one you want !
take me !
this is about me !
come on !

we' re too late .
the psycho heard us coming ... ... and slashed his throat with a knife .
what' s his condition ?
critical .
he' s lost a lot of blood .
get him down here .
i don' t want nobody dying on me .
all right .
kelly , where' s kelly ?
your wife' s fine , all right ?
all right , try not to sit up .
what hit me ?
rubber bullet .
figured if somebody' s gonna shoot you , it might as well be us .
thanks .
did you get him ?
you did .
i didn' t do anything .
give yourself some credit .
got yourself out alive .
doesn' t always happen that way .
are you okay ?
it' s okay .
i' m okay .
god .
i was so afraid .
i thought i wasn' t ever gonna see you again .
me too .
we' ve got things to talk about .
i only want to talk about what you want to tell me .
i want to tell you everything .
everything .
get that gurney over here .
get over here .
we lost him .
i want to stand up .
i got him .
sure you can hold on ?
i gotta see him .
you don' t want to see this .
yes , i do .
take it easy .
yes , i do .
allow me .
allow me .
go ahead .
you recognize him ?
yeah .
he was down here trying to deliver me a pizza ... ... 10 minutes before i got the call .
i told him to fuck off .
that' s enough these days .
just give it a minute .
we' il be driving , and you' il be flying .
whatever you say .
what a piece of shit .
nice shoes .
italian .
you hung up , stu .
i didn' t get a chance to say goodbye .
i feel bad about the pizza guy .
but i couldn' t miss seeing you and kelly reunited .
you don' t have to thank me .
nobody ever does .
i just hope your newfound honesty lasts .
because it if doesn' t , you' il be hearing from me .
isn' t it funny ?
you hear a phone ring , and it could be anybody .
but a ringing phone has to be answered , doesn' t it ?
doesn' t it ?
hello ?
