i' m sure there' s a bunch of clubs that can use a good singer , but we got a dj .

i' m sure they could , but my moon card expired ... ... and i was told you were the one person in town who might overlook that .
who told you something foolish like that ?
you know my father , nicholas lake ?
never heard of him .
nicky sticks ?
that' s your father ?
unbelievable .
that' s something .
normally i don' t call in favors , but my dad did save your life back in ' 76 .
he didn' t save my life , i saved his life .
and i lost a fine automobile in the process .
unless you got a new plymouth with my name on it , i got nothing to say .
so , good night .

i should have known .
i' m sorry .

just wanted to give you one last chance to change your mind .
look , no now and no tomorrow .
no means no .
leave me alone .
now , you look
clown .
who was that ?
one of rex crater' s boys , trying to buy me out .
why is he so set on buying your club ?
because they' re about to approve gambling in this town .
lf crater gets his way , they' il turn the moon into a big casino .
you can' t sell your club till i make enough money to get back home .
i' il let him know the next time he calls that you got to get your money first .
you all right ?

i' il intercept the call .
nash is alive .
he took off after jimmy , who' s headed for the vac .
be ready for him .
what' s the vac ?
the perfect vacuum , at the corner of glenn avenue and fifth .
why ?
didn' t you hear the phone call ?
i' m sorry , i cannot listen and hear at the same time .

only later models can do that !

i' m a ' 63 !
i' m at top speed !

you try to shake me down , then you blow up my club ?
you blew up my wood barstools !
you know how hard it is to get wood on the moon ?
shit !
you want to play games ?
you have to shoot around your boy !
it' s easier to shoot through him .
shit !
pluto , it' s a trap !
yeah , no kidding !
did you ever shoot a gun before ?
time to go , bruno !
all clear , boss !
come on !
bruno , heel !
you are really something , you know that ?
thank you .
you walked right into a trap any idiot could see from a mile away .
i was walking right out until you came along .
really ?
yes , really .
you put your neck on the line , i appreciate that .
but in the future , not that there' il be a future , if i need your help , i' il ask .
don' t worry about it , i' m getting out of here .
i saved your life twice .
least you can do is loan me enough money so i can go home .
i would , but they' il be looking for you at every bus station and shuttle launch .
me ?
they don' t even know what i look like .
every club in this city has a biometric camera system .
they took hundreds of pictures of you .
they know what you look like .
only way you' re going home now is in a box .
that' s just great .
now what ?
after you .
hey , roy .
pluto !
what are you doing here ?
my place is getting redecorated and i need a place overnight .
sure !
3d .
the code is 4 5 7 .

my , my .
lf this is too glitzy for you ... ... tomorrow we can get a room at the garden of eden .
they got a bathroom on every floor .
i hate the moon .
know why mooners can' t stand earthlings ?
you think everything back earth is better and can' t stop talking about it .
i went back earth once and the air smelled funny .
sneezing all the time , rained every day , bugs and shit everywhere .
you know the only thing i liked about it ?
you could see the moon at night ?
bingo .
ls something wrong with your toaster ?
he' s all right .
he' s just recharging .
can he hear us ?
not while he' s charging .
shouldn' t your bodyguard be able to keep up with you on the way to a gunfight ?
you might want to think about trading him in .
i can' t trade in bruno .
we got a history together .
i got 20 years of rill hopping experience wired into him .
rill hopping ?
well , that' s a ....
smuggling .
that' s what i went to jail for .
he ain' t the fastest thing in the world , but he got me out of lots of tight squeezes .
a little smokier than usual .
he' s a fire hazard .
he' s all right .
where are you going ?
i got to go talk to an old friend , see what i can find out .
what am i supposed to do ?
make sure bruno don' t burn the place down .
you' re leaving me alone with him ?
i left .
pluto !
you' re getting kind of old , rowland .
you should be so lucky .
every lowlife in town is looking to whack you .
i' m a popular guy .
what can i say ?
you want to lose some money ?
no , but you' il lose money .
we' il play some eight ball , regular stakes .
i will kindly empty your wallet for you .
you' re on .
how is your mother ?
still breaking hearts .
pizza time .
she should have married me .
you should have went to the gym and lost weight .
i' d have lost the weight if she married me .
otherwise , what' s the point ?
i really need your help .
i got to get to rex crater .
forget it .
nobody gets to him .
who the hell is this guy ?
a myth , an enigma .
he lives in a penthouse above the lunar grand hotel .
never comes out .
you was a cop for 20 years .
you got to have some kind of idea who he is .
some people think he' s a clone .
there was a clone doctor named runa pedanken .
made a big name for herself creating a basketball team from one old guy .
the air jordans .
right after cloning was outlawed back earth , pedanken came up here .
she was the best in her field until she got herself murdered .
that was about eight years ago .
i' m going to need to hack into police files .
you mean , you need me to hack into police files .
i thought you' d never ask .
pedanken , runa . lnitiate global search .
file deleted .
sorry , that' s all there is .
she wasn' t doing this by herself .
who worked with her ?
she had an assistant .
we questioned her for days about the murder .
got nothing .
that' s because you have no finesse .
who is she and where do i find her ?
mona zimmer .
runs a body alteration shop on microsoft and sixth .
that' s what i love about you .
i ask you a simple question , four hours later , i get a simple answer .
boss ?
where did the boss go ?
i don' t know .
out .
he said to wait for him here .
out ?
he never goes anywhere without me .
and i heard that toaster crack .
bruno , give me that old badge you got .
who are we going to arrest ?
i need your help .
sure .
where are we going ?
it' s just got to be the two of us .
you go next time .
promise .
that' s gratitude for you .
we were hoping that for our anniversary we could get a brand new us .
how romantic .
you' re in luck !
i just happen to have a cancellation .
fantastic !
are you all original or have you been previously improved ?
all original .
really ?
yes , from top to bottom .
okay , then .
well , what exactly did you have in mind ?
we were thinking we could start with some ass resculpting for her ... ... to get a little more bubblage
i happen to have a great ass !
i' m not saying your ass isn' t great .
we' d like something
could you do something about his big mouth ?
do you have any catalogues ?
maybe we could get some ideas .
come this way , i' il show you exactly what you want .
thank you .
come on , honey .
look at the asses on the wall .
yeah .
don' t push it .
let' s start with some of the basic body types .
here' s one i think you' il really like .
the amazon .
i don' t like that .
that makes me look like a big dufus , doesn' t it ?
where would we buy clothes ?
i don' t want to be the big dufus .
good point .
let me try again .
this one i' m particularly proud of .
the venice beach .
wait a minute .
i think you done found something there .
look at that , honey .
yeah , look at that .
look at me !
this is me ?
it could be .
honey , i' m looking and i' m thinking ... ... that you need to rethink the ass enhancement .
it will work , it will help out .
what you want is to have a ....
you know ?
she also needs a little more of this , too , up top .
can you fix this ?
lf you could spruce these up a little .
just a little sprucier .
i know that she has ample now .
but i' m talking titties galore .
let' s have the titties really flowing .
yeah , like that .
look at that .
why don' t we step into my office and discuss the terms ?
yes , let' s go in and sign up !
look at that !
before we get started , there' s a few things i' d like to talk over with you .
first of all , will you be paying in cash ... ... or would you like to take advantage of our flexible financing plan ?
all in cash , all at once .
excellent !
medical records ?
right here .
and police permit ?
our police permits ?
i think you' il find that our police permits are in order .
police permits .
sorry , no can do .
not without a police permit .
it' s body alteration 101 .
you could be fugitives , killers , anybody .
no , we' re just a couple trying to put the spark back in our relationship .
the idea of revealing such personal details to the police .
please , dr. zimmer ?
all right .
come back tonight , 8 : 00 sharp .
but it' s another $10, 000 upon completion .
all right .
then , doctor , you are busted .
give me a break .
what are you guys , the health department ?
you wish we were .
listen , you got one chance .
you answer some questions for me .
and i want the truth .
okay , what do you want to know ?
when you worked for runa pedanken  i never heard of her .
you want to play games ?
put the cuffs on her .
come on , cuff her .
no !
just hold on !
hold the cuffs .
tell me everything you know and don' t play games with me , mona .
talk to me .
what do you know ?
right now .
all right , all right .
towards the end , runa was dealing with some pretty heavy characters ... ... but she didn' t tell me who .
and she didn' t keep any records .
but one day i walked into her office as she was showing one of the guys out ... ... and he left his briefcase behind .
the initials wzw were embossed on it ... ... in gold .
and it was made out of genuine alligator skin .
are you with me ?
earth goods .
that' s all i know .
i swear it .
just for the record , i have never had one complaint about my ass .
i was just playing .
i said that for the lady .
it was part of the scam .
ma , what are you doing here ?
seeing that you' re all right .
ma , this is dina .
dina , my mother .
you' re his mother ?
why , you got a problem with that ?
i' m surprised .
you could easily pass for his sister .
thank you .
why are you gallivanting around ?
you' il wind up dead .
i got to take care of those guys that blew up my club .
you got to get your ass off the moon !
i don' t think so .
you think you' re a hot shit , ex rill hopping , burned down club owning guy ... ... but once in a while , listen to your mother .
all right , i' il get off the moon !
but can i get something to eat first ?
god !
bruno , get some beer and sandwiches .
and you ought to be a little nicer to your robot .
be nicer to my robot ?

gentlemen .

code generator serial number ?
8 7 4 3 5 0 8 .
check .
it' s not my business , but why don' t we just rent a car instead of stealing one ?
because you can' t rent these .
what' s so special about it ?
it' s a chrysler desoto s 5000 .
it cruises on a 14 inch cushion of air , hikes up to 64 inches in rough terrain .
it' s heat and meteor resistant , with a torque compressor power thrust ... ... and a kick ass sound system .
trust me on this one .
bruno , i need an ignition chip .
this might do the trick .
it will work perfect .
got to love a place where your bodyguard and car have interchangeable parts .
smart ass .
after you .
good evening , mr. vandervoort .
james here .
aren' t you early , sir ?
we' re surprising mrs. vandervoort with some jam and scones ... ... and picking her up at a spa on the far side .
you' re not mr. vandervoort at all .
you' re some hooligan trying to steal his motorcar .
i won' t have it !
shut up and drive .
head for the far side .
i' il give you to the count of three before i alert the authorities .
one .
sorry , james .
you' re too late .
i have disconnected your alarm relay .
so get moving , jimmy boy , or you' il have a speech impediment .
good god , i' m being stolen !
take over for a while , james .
i will not be an accomplice in this .
you' re not an accomplice , you' re a hostage .
do it .
i won' t be intimidated .
do it !
all right .
thank you .
nice work , james .
yeah , james .
you little asshole .
i heard that .
how are you holding up ?

hey , listen , i won' t let anything happen to you .
i promise .
all right .
how long does the night last up here ?
two weeks .
that' s so depressing .
no , it' s not .
it' s nice .
look at this .
when i was a little boy , i used to come out here with rowland ... ... look up and count the stars , and dream about what was out there .
i never heard such drivel in my life !
what kind of refreshments you got back here ?
dreadfully sorry , sir .
we weren' t expecting anyone .
i know you got something .
you going to make me house it ?
champagne and caviar !
don' t touch those , they' re for guests !
james , we are guests .
he' il get her drunk and have his way with her .
you know something ?
bad luck , old boy !
we were ambushed ?
ambushed ?
yes , sir .
really ?
well , they' re just not playing fair .
any other excuses ?
problems at home , cold coming on , work too stressful ?
what ?
nothing , sir .
good .
because the next time i talk to rex crater , i need to say nash is dead .
that' s all he wants to hear .
it' s as good as done .
or else you are .
get out of here .
we' il get right on it , sir .
where are we ?
safe .
it' s an old prospecting dome .
we found it years back .
nobody knows about it but me and bruno .
what' s the temperature out here ?
it' s about 200 below .
balmy .
play' s over .
get down here .
okay .
that was fun .
memories .
had a lot of memories in here , bruno .
look at all this junk .
what do you mean " junk " ?
this is called inventory .
show a little respect .
this is what' s left of my life' s work .
very interesting help you have around here .
that' s an old program i forgot to delete .
left it on " oops ! " i forgot that was in there .
miss me ?
guess not .
she' s an excellent piece of multi functional software .
lnitiate search .
convicted organized crime , earthling , initials wzw .
wzw .

thank you .
thanks for nothing .
worthless computer .
how' s it going ?
it' s not going at all .
babette made lunch .
thank you .
thank you so much .
can i help ?
computer' s got no information on our mystery man .
i' m starting to think that that zimmer conned us .
here' s your problem .
zimmer said wzw , not mzm .
you' re just looking at it upside
wait a minute .
you did it !
look at you !
you' re a genius !
look what you did .
she saw it upside down .
watch this .
lnitiate search .
convicted organized crime , earthling , initials mzm .
okay .
you see ?
now we have something .
open file 10 1 7 mm.
how do you feel about your acquittal , mr. marucci ?
makes me proud to live in this great country where justice is still served .
with gambling to be outlawed on earth , will the giovanetto syndicate ... ... engender a consortium to perpetuate a new gambling coalition on the moon ?
will the what do what to the what ?
speak english , sweetheart .
will you and the other major organized crime figures on earth
organized crime ?
i don' t know nobody in organized crime .
listen , darling ... ... you want to ask me a question , let' s sit down somewhere .
we' il open a bottle of wine , get to know each other better .
get a new dress , a nice pair of shoes .
be at my hotel around 7 : 00 .
what are you waiting for , a dance ?
i forgot the stairs were there .
back it up .
let me take it in a little closer here .
and closer still .
what do you see ?
so mike marucci is rex crater ?
one way to find out .
that' s pretty far fetched , pluto .
but i buy it .
marucci had the bucks , he had the balls .
he had the background to build moon beach .
not to mention he wouldn' t mind whacking anybody who got in his way .
so i noticed .
pluto , when you make an enemy , you don' t mess around .
yeah , you know me .
i' m gonna see an old buddy at the fbl , i' il get back to you .
right .
listen to that !
that' s connecticut .
listen how clear .
what' s this ?
no , don' t do that !
stop !
that' s a cryogenic chihuahua !
it' s a real dog ?
yeah , it' s very delicate .
you know it' s illegal to bring pets here .
but i got a friend back in jurez who knows how to freeze dry these things .
look at that .
it' s a girl .
pop that little bitch in the particle wave for two minutes on defrost ... ... she' il be running around the room .
i used to get $5, 000 a pop for these things .
where' d you do your singing back earth ?
weddings , bar mitzvahs , reincarnation rituals .
the usual gigs .
i hit a rut ... ... so i sent my tape to a club i heard about up here .

rent a car and wait outside the front entrance of the hotel .
i might have to make a fast getaway .
but what if you don' t get away ?

all right , here we go .
i' il stop this so nobody bothers us .
i gotta get that later .

that' s rex' s elevator down there .

it only stops at the subbasement and his penthouse .
my elevator only goes as low as this floor .
how do i get from one elevator to the other one ?
that' s what tony is here to help you with .
i' il tell you the whole thing .
back up as far as you can go , get a good running start , jump out across .
jump across to what ?
the ledge !
see that ledge down there ?
grab onto these wires and swing down onto the ledge .
you want me to grab hot wires ?
how do you know they' re hot ?
look , the shit is hot !
grab the ones that aren' t hot .
swing down , get down to the ledge .
then you wait an hour and a half till they bring rex' s late supper up to him .
when the elevator goes by , before it passes you , you jump on top .
use this casino chip to unscrew the trapdoor on top of the elevator .
jump down inside and take out the two robot guards , pop pop !
boom !
you' re alone in the elevator , you got a meeting with rex .
what' s plan b ?
this is plan b.
i' m here to accept mr. crater' s offer .

we' il have to get back to you on that .

i' m here to pay you .

we need to get a car .
what are you in such a hurry for ?
you wanted to talk to mr. crater ?
here you are .
i finally get to meet the great rex crater ?
or is it mike marucci ?
yeah , mike marucci .
thought you were so damn smart , i figured you out .
i should come over there and put my foot in your fat grease ball ass .
so you got it all figured out , huh ?
it is a pleasure to meet me .
i' m pretty feisty , huh ?
what' s this , a rented tuxedo ?
you know , you' re old enough to own your own tuxedo .
sit down !
you know , you should be honored .
only person besides yourself to ever come up here is belcher over there .
what' s going on here ?
remember when they cut your appendix out eight years ago in prison ?
gambling had just been outlawed on earth , so my old boss ... ... mike marucci , commissioned dr. runa pedanken to create a clone ... ... of someone who knew their way around the moon .
for what ?
he was starting a gambling operation and needed someone to front for him .
someone intelligent , that he could control .
a puppet .
that didn' t jive with my career plan so i sent marucci and pedanken into orbit .
then , for sentimental reasons , or because i' m a nice guy , i let you live .
until you got in my way .
let' s face it , why should i keep you around ?
for what ?
i got your good looks , your charm and your wit .
i even got your memories .
you got my memories ?
yeah .
never wondered how my people knew to look for you in your hideout ?
or the paradise motel , which , by the way , is a disgusting establishment .
i' m surprised you didn' t break into a rash after staying there .
next time i' il remember to find better accommodations .
mr. mogan and mr. kelp have arrived , sir .
yes .

an excellent piece of real estate , but you never took advantage of its potential .

this is wrong .
that should say rex' s , because this is rex' s .
little america' s most exclusive new casino !

i think you' re a clown and you should take all this stupid casino shit out .
