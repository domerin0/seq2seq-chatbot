adam' s apples
adam ?
sorry i' m late .
ivan fjeldsted .
call me lvan .
i' m a bit flustered but i' ve been looking forward to meeting you .
let' s get going .
let me take your bag .
that was ...
come on .
people who have been in prison are often a bit protective of their stuff .
have you lived in the country before ?
this is our small church .
just take a look at this .
this is our apple tree .
we' re very proud of it .
there are lots of apples this year .
lots and lots .
it' s probably because of the warm summer .
they' re not ripe just yet .
don' t eat that .
come with me .
good morning .
good morning .
adam will stay with us .
this is khalid and gunnar .
i won' t talk to egghead .
there will be lots of time for that kind of talk .
come on , adam .
what does the o stand for ?
in adam o. pedersen ?
what' s the story about the o ?
your parents must have told you .
i forgot to ask .
that' s a good answer .
it says here that you' re a neo nazi .
are you really ?
it' s not the first thing that springs to mind by looking at you .
here it says you' re evll .
it' s rude to write that on a person' s cv .
are you really evil ?
i didn' t think so .
tell you what , just forget about this
because there are no evil people .
we don' t believe in that .
if you only look for evil then the world is evil .
but you can try to focus on the silver lining as we do here .
that makes everything easier .
in later years the devil has sent his troops to test us
but we have conquered them all .
all of us here have found god in some way .
you just met khalid and gunnar .
i saw that you did .
gunnar was paroled four years ago .
he was just to stay three months , but he chose to stay .
gunnar was what you would call an alcoholic .
he stole and raped girls but now he' s on the wagon
and is studying theology .
he' s not the only one .
there' s also khalid .
he used to rob gas stations .
do you remember a young man being shot when he went to buy condoms ?
no .
khalid is still not allowed at statoil .
a few hostage dramas later he' s learning danish and is doing well .
tell me what i have to do .
i can' t do that .
you have to discover that for yourself .
all i want is for you to set yourself a goal .
are you listening to me ?
yes , i believe i am .
in any other situation i would say that you are rude
but let' s not talk about that now .
what do you want your goal to be ?
i would like to bake a cake .
bake a cake ?
oh , an apple cake ?
yes , an apple cake .
my goal is to bake a big apple cake .
with the apples from our garden ?
yes , the apples from the garden .
that' s a good idea .
i think we found your goal .
you' re going to bake a cake .
you' il look after the tree until 1 st of august .
then you' il use them to bake an apple cake .
i just wanted to give you this .
it has both the old and the new testament .
it' s a good thing to have .
sleep tight .
evil has many faces
and it can be difficult to tell them apart and choose sides .
especially these days where so many things are said in this and that town .
everything has so many nuances .
also we humans .
if the game of chess had undergone the same development as humans
the queen would be in front , the rooks would be crooked
and the pawn would be the main piece .
we no longer know who we are and this rootlessness ...
are we boring you , poul ?
is the word of god boring to you ?
are we boring you ?
i need to go to the loo .
can' t it wait ?
not really .
we finish in 20 minutes .
i think that poul can wait that long .
let him go for sake of fuck and crap .
so we can song sing now .
okay , democracy has spoken .
go , poul .
go take a crap .
but you can' t come back in .
that' s okay .
you have to use the hospital loo because you can' t use ours .
why not ?
it' s locked during the service .
why ?
for security reasons .
let' s continue if it' s okay with poul .
we' il sing 634 " you know my heart " .
there' s fried pork .
it was a good sermon today .
at least it was shorter than usual .
too bad for old poul nordkap .
ivan is always on his case .
he leaves during the sermon .
it' s not nice of him .
he always does that .
it' s because he was in a concentration camp during the war .
he' s become restless in his old age .
he' s 86 .
it won' t be any fun when that age comes .
don' t worry about lvan .
he' s okay .
just don' t venture into an argument with him .
what the hell are you doing ?
me ?
my phone !
i thought you were sleeping .
and my wallet !
are you stealing my stuff ?
have you gone insane ?
i' m sorry .
piss off , fatso !
sleep tight .
piss off !
book of job
they' re not moving .
they cheeky for sake of fuck !
fly home bird for sake of fuck !
what are we going to do ?
there won' t be any apples left for your cake .
let the paki monkey climb up and shoo them away .
i' m not talking to you .
i don' t know anything about birds .
what do we do in a case like this ?
you leave them alone , i think .
can' t we let them eat the apples ?
they' re adam' s apples for the cake .
for sake of fuck , he can' t bake .
you don' t know that .
if adam wants to bake us a cake it' s our job to support him .
he can' t bake bread .
shut up !
i can tell .
what the fuck do you know , paki ?
that' s the right attitude .
that kind of attitude will get us some cake .
there' s more of them coming .
that' s just plain rude .
that' s good .
very authentic .
no bird will come back now .
reverend fjeldsted ?
yes ?
call me lvan .
i' m sarah svendsen .
hi .
this is my assistant adam .
i' m not from around here .
i wanted to come to the service but i couldn' t .
don' t apologise .
you only cheat yourself .
what' s this ?
you' re in a bad way .
let' s go inside and talk .
i met this guy .
the milk has gone bad .
fine .
i was thinking about her .
me too .
no , you didn' t .
are you saying i didn' t ?
are you ?
let' s take that discussion right now .
this may be the right time and place .
he came to canaan after having turned water into wine .
a boy was sick .
do to others as you want them to do to you .
don' t call me inconsiderate .
it' s okay .
i don' t take milk .
maybe we have some cookies .
adam , could you go see if there' s a few cookies for sarah and me ?
maybe i shouldn' t have come .
sure .
so you met a guy ?
i have been in indonesia working for the world wide fund for nature .
i made love to a man and got pregnant .
i used to drink a lot before .
now i' m in aa and i' ve been sober for 341 days .
now they' re saying that the baby may be handicapped .
i don' t know where the dad is ...
just a second , sarah .
why do i get three cookies and sarah only two ?
don' t you find that odd ?
there were five left .
hers looked bigger .
i don' t think so .
have you measured the cookies ?
he never does that .
let' s stop this discussion .
you would like to get rid of it ?
yes ...
no !
there' s a 60 % chance that the baby is handicapped .
i have to decide within a week before it' s too late .
i can' t handle a handicapped child .
60 per cent is a lot , right ?
it' s just statistics .
let me tell you something .
when we were expecting our son we were told that he could be disabled .
we could have been intimidated by statistics and reason
but we chose to look at the bright side , and now ...
when i see him run around in the garden or doing his homework
we' re happy that we chose to have him .
you won' t find anyone to say otherwise .
the devil is testing us all the time .
we have to make the right choices .
if we all listened to reason the world would be a gloomy place to live .
you need to follow you heart and have the baby .
fuck !
good morning .
fuck , that hurt !
why the hell haven' t you turned the cooker off ?
this looks bad .
what did reverend fjeldsted say ?
he' s a frigging idiot .
he may be weird , but he' s a good boy .
his life sure as shit hasn' t been easy .
everything went wrong from the start .
his mother died giving birth to him .
he lived with his father and sister .
until they took him away .
ivan ?
they took lvan away ?
no , nobody took lvan away .
the father was taken away .
henning .
why ?
he was fucking those kids black and blue .
they could hardly walk .
shut up and fix this .
pardon my forthrightness .
i' ve learned it' s best to tell it like it is .
you' re best served by being told the truth .
what' s this i hear ?
the cooker bit you ?
gunnar forgot to turn it of .
take a seat .
i' d like to talk to you .
do you know why all this is happening ?
why are all these birds in the tree ?
and the cooker .
why did you burn yourself all of the sudden ?
i think someone is trying to tell you that you shouldn' t go near the cooker .
you can' t bake a cake without a cooker .
i think satan is testing us .
by not letting me bake the cake ?
he' s trying to fight us .
he' s testing your strength to withstand him .
he' s always doing it to me .
look at your hand .
you' re a complete moron .
nobody is doing anything .
gunnar just forgot to turn it off .
he always makes sure to turn it off .
that fat pig is hammered !
hey , fat and drunk !
so many accusations , but there may be an explanation .
you should know that he was the best danish tennis player in his youth .
he won all his matches but then a ball was mistakenly called to be out .
gunnar lost and everything went downhill .
what about khalid ?
this was in his coat pocket .
what are you saying ?
those two haven' t changed .
you' re a joke .
let' s forbid people to wear hats .
it' s a balaclava during summer .
khalid is from a hot climate .
here' s fucking 17, 000 in cash .
you' re reaching , adam .
khalid is saving to buy new clothes .
you didn' t know .
give me my phone and my wallet or i' il smash your face in .
that' s not fucking mine !
stay away from my stuff .
do you understand ?
you' re lucky that i' m going back in because i would beat you every day .
i' m going to the casualty room , will you pass the market ?
i could .
could you get my cough syrup ?
sure , what' s it called ?
von osten .
right .
think about what we can do about the birds , if you have time .
here you go .
it can' t be traced but throw it away anyway .
can you shoot with that hand ?
are you going to whack the priest ?
he' s fucked up .
he got it in the ass as a kid .
now he' s all turn the other cheek .
but you' re getting out in 11 weeks .
we' re waiting for you .
espen can' t control them .
i' m not going to shoot him .
i just want to understand .
i need to break him .
all that goodness shit .
does it involve the pear pie ?
espen says you talk about a pie .
it' s an apple cake , okay ?
it doesn' t matter .
i said that i would bake a cake and the idiot won' t let up .
he says that the devil is testing us because birds are eating the apples .
do you need help ?
who the fuck do you think you' re talking to ?
see you .
go on .
get them !
don' t be afraid .
go on .
get them .
he' s making them nervous .
they care fucking not about the cat .
all can see .
yes .
lambert is not working .
my granddad had a cherry tree .
it was attacked by birds , so he shot a few in the morning and evening .
shot them ?
with a gun ?
no , a waffle iron .
of course it was a gun .
what gun ?
one like this .
you know what ?
i think that we should try it .
can you take them from there ?
can we guns use ?
for sake of fuck , why you not said ?
well ...
lambert ?
lambert , are you okay ?
what just happened ?
he' s dead .
it was a shit cat anyhow .
he shot my cat .
let' s stop with the accusations .
it was an old cat .
he just happened to fall down while we were shooting .
if you want to discuss it now we can .
okay .
we talked about your grandfather .
do you know what i think ?
i think it' s going to be a good day .
it' s too bad that khalid won' t come in when we' re making his favourite food .
he' s embarrassed about lambert .
where did he get the gun ?
is he a terrorist ?
he wants to return to saudi arabia .
you should see his dream house .
it' s really nice .
with a bit more statoil money he can go home .
why not just rob a bank khalid is very committed to politics .
he only robs multinational companies .
that' s why he robs statoil .
statoil stole his father' s land for the oil .
khalid is taking back his property .
statoil is norwegian .
no , i don' t think so .
statoil is norwegian !
remember to tell khalid that .
so lvan knows what he' s doing ?
yes .
ivan just want him to be calm .
ivan is not exactly normal .
the anniversary of his wife' s death is coming up .
he had a wife ?
yes , linda .
she ate some pills and killed herself because they got a handicapped son .
he' s got cerebral palsy .
he can' t move at all .
she couldn' t take that .
can i come in ?
adam , there sure is no shortage of recipes for apple cake in this world .
it looks like we' ve won round one .
what a handsome man .
your father ?
that' s hitler .
no , hitler had a beard .
you' re right .
i' m thinking of that russian guy .
i' il leave you to it .
hitler' s enemies didn' t take him seriously either .
don' t you think that i do ?
that' s just plain rude .
old paul nordkap who' s in the hospital with no will to live
he was a bigger nazi than anyone .
why do you think they ask me to cheer him up ?
wasn' t he in a camp ?
sure .
he was working there .
he met goblins and all those folks .
goebbels ?
he was probably also there .
come with me to visit .
then we can see who takes who seriously .
deal ?
book of job
hello !
i' m glad that you could make it .
he' s dying .
he won' t last through the night .
i broke it to him gently .
well , let' s give him a good sendoff .
how' s the hand ?
okay .
what about the honker , lvan ?
it took quite a beating .
you don' t have to waste money on perfume anymore , lvan .
you won' t smell anything again .
yes .
come on , adam .
what' s up with you , poul ?
have you lost your appetite ?
i' ve brought a guest for you .
hello .
adam pedersen .
are you feeling a bit low ?
i' m scared .
relax .
what have you been up to ?
have the nurses been nicer to you ?
don' t make them .
i don' t deserve it .
they have been nagging poul because of this past but we put a stop to that .
didn' t we , poul ?
has miriam been nicer to you ?
yes , she made me hot chocolate yesterday and tucked me in .
they are all so nice to me .
that' s good .
don' t be upset .
i don' t deserve it .
let it be .
everybody deserves to be tucked in .
did she fluff your duvet and pillow ?
yes .
there , there .
i apologise for trying to cheat .
i just don' t like being inside the church .
that' s all forgotten now .
i know that' s what you always say .
i' m scared , lvan .
i dare not sleep .
i' m so afraid .
fiddlesticks !
you have nothing to worry about .
let' s focus on the people who cares for you and all your lovely memories .
oh god !
poul , don' t cry anymore .
don' t be so hard on yourself .
all has been forgiven .
if you only knew what we did ...
all those poor people .
it can' t be forgiven .
stop it .
nobody remembers anymore .
oh god !
stop your whinging .
it' s not as bad as all that .
we all make mistakes but we don' t let it bring us down .
you' re crazy , man .
why do you say that ?
why spoil the mood by being plain rude ?
i' d be happy to discuss it , but this is not the place .
let' s focus on the word of god .
god forgives all , poul .
god forgives all .
it' s difficult .
even though you seen it before it' s still difficult every time .
did you discuss your wife' s death ?
yes , i talked to lots .
a wife' s suicide must be painful .
yes , that can' t be nice .
linda didn' t take her own life .
but she took pills ?
yes , but it was an accident .
accident how ?
christoffer had been playing with her pills and had put them in a candy dish .
linda always had a sweet tooth and she thought they were yellow m& ms.
your son christoffer ?
so he' s actually able to move ?
why wouldn' t he be ?
i thought he was paralysed .
no , i wish .
there' s no stopping him .
just yesterday he was playing rounders .
i don' t believe you , lvan .
i just don' t .
i' ve never heard anything that crazy .
has gunnar told tall stories and played fast and loose with the truth ?
if it is that' s just plain rude .
why don' t you bring him tomorrow ?
he' s already coming .
he' s been pestering me all week to come .
good .
then you can see for yourself .
good morning .
good morning .
christoffer , this is adam .
adam , christoffer .
maybe you could go say hello .
yum , eggs .
small mouthfuls .
he' s paralysed .
what did you say ?
i have to go in tower .
you two stay here .
i need shoot black bird .
sit down .
he' s paralysed .
christoffer , go into daddy' s office .
now !
this will not be pleasant to watch .
what did you say ?
he' s paralysed .
isn' t he paralysed , lvan ?
is he really , adam ?
yes , he has cerebral palsy .
that is just crazy .
khalid , what do you have to say ?
khalid ?
him is it .
ivan , he' s spastic paralysed .
your son' s a spastic .
your wife killed herself .
your mother died giving birth to you .
your dad raped you .
look at me , lvan .
look at me .
you bleeding from an ear .
you bleeding from an ear , for sake of fuck !
the other way .
ivan was bleeding from an ear .
that has happened to me .
just drink milk .
plenty of milk .
just give up , lvan .
there' s something you should know .
christoffer is recovering from a very nasty bout of the flu .
i' m the first to admit that he' s been a bit sluggish lately .
shut the fuck up !
if he hurts you turn the other cheek .
god is on my side .
what is his problem ?
he needs to be locked up !
i' m not one to gossip
but he' s always been considered a phenomenon .
i don' t know if you know ?
how the hell should i know ?
he' s sick .
very sick .
i bloody well know that .
no , not like that .
well , he is that too
but he' s terminally ill .
what' s wrong with him ?
cancer .
he has a brain tumour the size of a volleyball .
i' ve never seen anyone with such a large brain tumour .
i' il bash your face in if you call him a walking miracle .
have you heard about the ravashi syndrome ?
ravashi was an indian footballer
who lost both his feet in a go kart accident in 1957 .
in a state of shock over the accident he ran home on the stumps of his legs .
his brain blocked the fact that he had no feet .
for two months he came to practice .
he kept his midfield position .
without feet ?
they were a bad team .
they were maybe in the fifth league .
ivan has experienced so much hardship
that he needs to find an explanation in order to live with it .
that' s why he thinks that the devil has it in for him .
ivan would say that everything is a test .
you' re a test , his cancer is a test , his son' s handicap is a test .
in lvan' s mind he' s locked in fierce battle with the devil himself .
ivan has no mind to lose and he blocks out everything like ravashi .
he' s in denial about all the bad stuff .
death , mutilation , hardship , evil .
that simply doesn' t exist in lvan' s world .
why does he bleed from his ears ?
we have asked ourselves that .
i think it' s when something comes too close .
someone once got through to him .
he bled from his ears once before .
that was three years ago .
what happened ?
you don' t know his sister katinka .
a total slapper .
she fucked everybody .
i even fucked her when she was here to have her adenoids removed .
when she died lvan almost fell to pieces .
he bled from his ears and got sick .
what happened then ?
you know lvan .
a few days later he was jolly as ever .
you could kill him by making him understand ?
yes , in theory .
give up , adam .
god is on my side .
never forget that .
hi .
the cooker is broken .
i wanted to make christoffer a pizza .
let' s fix it .
i don' t know how .
we' il get by .
where did christoffer go ?
he' s in your office with a woman .
she' s quite upset .
her name is sarah and she' s a real hottie .
when she saw christoffer she started screaming .
she didn' t want coffee .
well , we' d better ...
so nice of you to visit again .
has he been good ?
tell me he isn' t yours .
i can' t because this is christoffer .
have you two been introduced ?
how can you say the things you did ?
say what kind of things ?
you said that nothing was wrong with him .
that he could do math .
yes , he can .
even the complicated kind .
adam , maybe you should go get some of the cookies that sarah likes .
i' il come too .
is anyone hungry ?
you can hook up the new cooker now .
we' il see if this one lasts a bit longer .
what are you doing ?
playing with coins .
gunnar is good .
but you' re pregnant .
it' s a bit late for that .
we' re rewriting an article .
about what ?
the tigers in the orient .
here they write that there' s only 400 left .
that' s a sure way to make them extinct .
like last round at the pub .
what do you do then , gunnar ?
you buy a pint an a chaser .
the fuck you do !
gunnar is right .
we have to do something .
shut up , man !
stay out of it .
yes , adam , stop disturbing us because we' re busy .
five tigers is dying every day .
six !
six tigers a day , adam .
they can really jump high those tigers .
i' il come right out and say it .
you better come with me .
there' s a new apple problem .
shall we say in five minutes by the tree ?
i come and no understand .
i look fruit and see worm .
no , i actually discovered it , but i don' t need any credit .
for sake of fuck , is on all fruit .
that' s just plain rude .
yes , adam , it never stops .
let' s do something about it .
take down the sick fruit and spray the rest .
gunnar , come with me .
we have to arrange poul' s return to god .
book of job
poul bkel hermann , known to friend and foe as poul nordkap
lived a long and full life .
in his life poul learned that to know god you must dance with the devil .
if any poul nordkap surely did that .
poul learned that it' s futile to fight good because
despite all the cruelty , screaming and tears he had caused in his youth
he realised in the end that this was just a mere moment .
the ocean heaved but it was a wasted effort .
the world continued and good prevailed as always .
that' s why poul can return to god with peace of mind .
adam and i were by his side when he passed quietly away .
i' m not afraid .
i' m ready .
but this is not all about poul
because today christoffer turns nine .
before we gorge ourselves on cake
let' s honour poul with a hymn .
kaj munk' s number 634 .
you know my heart " .
there you are .
i thought you had gone to bed .
i' d like to talk to you .
can' t it wait ?
it has been a long day for christoffer with all this attention .
i' d like to talk to you now .
okay then .
go into dad' s office and cuddle up under a blanket .
what' s up with you ?
is the business with the birthday cake ?
what if the devil isn' t testing you ?
what do you mean ?
what if it isn' t him who' s been dogging you ?
i see .
you' re reaching again .
if not the devil then who ?
a little elf ?
maybe all the birds , the cooker and the worms are just a coincidence ?
is that what you' re telling people ?
god .
pardon ?
god .
i don' t understand .
what if god is on your case ?
why would he do that ?
because he hates you .
i' ve read this book .
book of job .
yes .
you' ve read it , right ?
no .
it' s about a crocodile .
that' s what i' ve heard .
yes , it' s about a crocodile , but it' s also about much more .
remember god killed job' s cattle ?
his seven camels and his ten kids ?
he takes everything away from him and makes him a leper .
does that remind you of anything ?
i never had a camel .
look at me .
look at me , lvan !
you know that god is behind this , right ?
god is not on your side , lvan .
yes , he is .
i don' t believe any of this shit .
i just want you to know that it' s god .
the devil hasn' t wasted any time on you .
god wants to kill you .
you' re just so dense that you don' t get it .
why are you doing this to me ?
because i' m evil .
you can' t change that .
there fire in sky .
him lvan gone ?
he forgot moron kid .
for sake of fuck , it was all fresh !
every night we now go to bed hungry .
he' s done for .
you could use him as a crapper .
have you had coffee ?
no .
is he going to ...
die ?
you bet your ass he is .
why do you think that the bloke began bleeding from all orifices in his skull ?
i give him four weeks , five tops .
from a medical point of view it doesn' t matter .
he' s come to his senses .
somehow you' ve managed to take away his faith .
that' s why i want to buy you coffee .
it doesn' t matter .
well excuse me .
are you ready ?
get up , lvan , we need the room .
go with adam .
are you coming ?
call me when he gets to weak .
we' il give him a room and a shot of morphine .
god hates us , christoffer .
he' s always hated us .
it doesn' t look too good .
gather the others .
well , the fact is ...
adam already knows but ...
i' m dying .
die how ?
i' il sleep with the worms .
are you not going to stay ?
no , that would be difficult .
what are we to do ?
well , i hope that you ...
i don' t know .
i don' t know what you should do .
i don' t know anything anymore .
if i said anything that you can use then do that or don' t .
i don' t care .
that' s all .
where you' re going ?
i feel like a drink .
i' ve earned that .
gunnar ...
leave me alone .
you idiot !
gunnar , that' s stupid .
you had a hair .
here' s one more .
we have three .
ivan deserve good cake .
what the fuck are you doing ?
i' m picking apples .

what happened ?

what' s wrong with you ?
are you fucking kidding us ?
