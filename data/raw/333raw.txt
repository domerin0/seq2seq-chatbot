not bad .
but not good enough to live .
mind if i sit down ?
i don' t have your energy .
fight with your head .
not your heart .
straight .
better , einon .
but you' re still dead .
purpose , not passion .
no one ever found victory in the dirt .
the peasants are revolting .
they' ve always been revoltin ' , prince .
but now they' re rebellin ' .
king freyne wants his son to witness his noble victory .
there' s nothing noble about crushing desperate men .
they' re traitorous scum !
the king commands !
bring him !
you can come , too , nursemaid .
die , you dog !
i wish we were down there .
no , you don' t .
yes , i do .
just to see you in action , bowen .
yours would be the finest blade on the field .
my blade was not made for your father' s slaughter .
he is my father , bowen , and he is the king .
yes .
but when you are king , remember today ... and the difference between battle and butchery .
and remember the old code .
then you' il be a greater king than your father .
i promise , knight ...
i will be greater .
freyne !
now , hewe , now !
he' s trapped !
einon !
einon !
einon , no !
enough !
enough !
the battle' s out there !
father ?
die !
it' s mine !
einon !
einon !
i' m here , einon !
i' m here , my king .
dead , madam .
king freyne , your husband , slain .
in here !
in here , on the bed .
get out !
out !
out !
brok , out !
you stay , bowen .
forgive me , queen aislinn .
there' s nothing to forgive .
his father' s tyranny brought him to this end .
he' s beyond all help .
not all .
a knight is sworn to valor .
sworn to valor .
his heart knows only virtue .
virtue .
his blade defends the helpless .
his might upholds the weak .
you must stay awake , my son !
you must stay awake .
repeat the code .
the code .
his might upholds the weak .
h his word speaks only truth .
his wrath
undoes the wicked .
brok , stay there .
lord !
great one !
your song is sad !
are the stars shining tonight ?
no .
no bright souls glitter in this darkness .
leave us .
go .
aislinn , daughter of the celts .
whose people loved your kind and called you friend .
ah , the king' s son ... cruel and full of trickery .
is this why you' ve come , dragonslayer' s wife ?
dragonslayer' s widow !
this boy is not his father .
this knight here is his mentor .
he has taught him the old code .
i need your help .
the wound is deep .
you know what you ask .
i will teach him your ways .
he will grow in your grace .
he will grow just and good .
i swear .
no !
the boy must swear .
give me your sword , knight .
your sword !
do not be afraid .
he can save you .
now listen to me , boy .
swear that your father' s blood lust and tyranny died with him .
swear that you will live and rule with mercy .
come to me and learn the once ways .
now swear !
i swear .
he' s dead !
peace , knight of the old code .
witness the wonders of an ancient glory .
half my heart to make you whole .
its strength to purify your weakness .
live , and remember your oath .
i served the father only for the sake of the son .
all my hopes rest on him .
forgive a doubting fool .
call when you need of me .
ask what you will of me .
my sword , my service are yours .
only remind him always of his vow ...
knight of the old code .
brok .
your majesty ?
the romans built this great fortress .
i will rebuild it , and mine will be greater .
it will take many men , my lord , to rebuild this ruin .
yes .
yes , it will .
not so rebellious now .
you should thank me , boy .
it was my stroke made you king .
no , brok , i want no martyrs .
death should be a release , not a punishment .
look good , dog .
i' m the last thing you' il ever see .
burn the insolence out of his eyes .
no !
no !
not my eyes !
no !
father !
run !
how dare you defy me !
einon , you' re unwell .
you' ve been bewitched .
look at this !
it' s madness !
remember the code !
the king is above the code !
have you forgotten everything i taught you ?
no one is above the code ... especially the king .
dragon , i loved that boy , and you changed him !
you tricked me , dragon !
no matter where you fly ... no matter where you go , i will find you !
today i make a new vow !
i will spend the rest of my life hunting you down !
avalon , oh , avalon .
for you i quest each day ... the resting place of arthur ... and the old code of his way .
and when i find those holy stones ...
i' il pray , i' il pray , i' il pray .
oh , avalon , bright avalon ... think me not a fool .
my quest is not for vanity , my quest is spiritual .
spiritual !
merlin , spiritual !
whoa !
merlin !
merlin !
ow !
everyone' s a critic !
dragon , dragon .
yes , i know .
where ?
there , there .
get back here , horse .
you coward .
marvelous !
heroics befitting the days of arthur and the round table !
never have i seen such skill !
then you must have lived the sheltered life ... of a mon monk .
why , yes .
a scribe , scholar , historian and poet .
your servant , sir , brother gilbert of glockenspur .
my humble life is in debt to your exalted prowess ... your dauntless courage , and your superb , swift sword .
you have the poet' s gift of exaggeration .
sir , you should read my histories .
but you belittle your talent .
modesty as well as valor .
the code of ancient camelot still lives .
hardly worthy of camelot .
still , it' s one less dragon .
well done , knight !
congratulations .
our gratitude , mine and king einon' s .
uh , you can keep your gratitude .
i' il take the gold .
yours or the king' s .
gold , knight ?
we made a bargain , remember ?
one dragon put down , one bag of gold .
your honor has a price , sir knight ?
it has expenses .
honor won' t feed my belly nor shoe my horse .
the priest is right .
it is your duty to protect king einon' s vassals as a knight of the realm .
not of this realm .
i bend no knee to einon .
i should have known .
foreign riffraff !
well , begone , vagabond , before i arrest you !
back to work , you scum !
if king einon' s wheat isn' t cut before the rain ...
i' il do a little cutting of my own !
sir knight !
sir knight , wait !
sir knight !
hear me out !
i' m on a pilgrimage .
might we travel together ?
the road' s still free , unless einon' s taxed it .
a road tax , king einon .
hmm ?
a road tax .
they are your roads , after all .
people really ought to pay for the privilege of using them .
and those that can' t pay will have to work it off .
lngenious , felton .
only you could keep such a good brain under such a bad hat .
that' s very good , " bad hat .
out of my way , peacock .
brok , some are good at hunting men , some are good at hunting money .
both have value for me .
kara ?
kara , i told you
i told you not to come here anymore .
i' m a disobedient child .
go on .
take a drink .
go on .
magnificent shot , your highness !
care to double the wager ?
ah , yes , happily .
shall we say the water bucket ?
stand still .
stand still .
superb !
double again ?
double again .
why not ?
i say .
a moving target .
peasant scum .
you' ve got a nerve , interfering with the king' s sport !
there' s no sport in tormenting a sick , old man .
i beg your majesty , let him go .
it' s been 12 years .
your castle is built .
he can do you no more harm .
for god' s sake , release him .
father !
i' ve always said death is a release , not a punishment .
go .
kara .
yoo hoo !
yoo hoo !
i' ve decided to compose " the ballad of bowen " !
how do you prefer i should write this ?
far away !
oh , don' t concern yourself with my safety !
i mean verse , meter .
shall i spice it up with a poetical flourish ... or just the cold , hard facts ?
if you do not be quiet ... you and i shall be the only things that are cold and hard around here .
i mean , it' s all very well to go hacking and whacking at dragons .
but if a dragon falls in the forest and nobody gets to hear about it , does it make a thud ?
brother gilbert .
what ?
the quill is mightier than the s
ooh .
the quill is mightier than the
that' s all that' s left of the last dragonslayer ... who tangled with me !
if i were you , i' d quit while i was ahead .
is that the best you can do ?
catch !
you know , i' ve got quite a collection of victims in here .
i won' t be added to it !
i' ve given you my final warning .
into the mouth of death he strode .
into the gringy gloom .
into the pit of fear unknown ... perhaps to court his doom .
that was good .
what did i say ?
what did i say ?
a little damp for fire , isn' t it ?
why must you knight errands out to make a name for yourselves ... always pick on us dragons ?
i don' t need a name !
and i have a collection of my own !
yeah ?
you' re one who kills dragons for money .
it' s honest enough work .
one must earn a living .
oh , yes , one must live .
well , since you seek a profit , we might as well begin .
oh , don' t flatter yourself .
it' s not the profit .
it' s the pleasure .
perhaps less pleasurable and more costly than you think !
bowen !
bowen , take care !
he went that way !
take care , bowen !
you can' t fly forever !
neither can you !
slow down !
come , visit the woods !
whoa !
look out !
well done !
ow !
pity .
that must have hurt .
yeah !
again ?
ow !
and again ?
how do you like the ride so far ?
we' re earning our money now , aren' t we ?
now , is there somewhere you would like me to drop you off ?
yikes !
the sword against the fang and claw .
the flame against the shield .
blah , blah , blah , which one would win ?
blah , blah , field , shield , wield .
whose flesh from bones be peeled .
oh , no .
whose fate would soon be sealed .
whose fate would soon be sealed ?
whose fate would soon be sealed !
oh , you' re good .
haven' t had this sort of challenge in some time .
nor likely to again !
drat !
a little overconfident , aren' t we ?
hardly .
but if you win , you' il be out of work .
i will not stop until i' ve rid the world of every last one of you .
i am the last one !
you' re just trying to save your scaly hide with tricks .
haven' t you noticed the pickings are rather slim these days ?
i got me one just the other day .
so it was you who killed the scarred one .
she and i were the last .
must' ve been a proud kill , warrior .
how much gold did her tattered carcass put in your purse ?
that' s none of your business .
couldn' t have been very much .
and you' il kill me for sport ?
and when there are no more dragons to slay ... how will you make a living , knight ?
shut up !
whoa !
if your teeth come down , my sword goes up , right into your brain !
if your sword goes up , my teeth come down !
into the moonlit night the titans dueled ... in mortal combat bound .
oh , who' d the fatal false step make ?
whose blood would stain the ground ?
oh , good lord .
sir eglamore .
oh , thank you very much .
it' s been stuck down there for months .
can you get your buttocks off my tongue ?
why should you be comfortable ?
my armor is rusting in your drool , and your breath is absolutely foul .
well , what do you expect ... with old knights rotting between my molars ?
oh , god , my mouth is so dry .
no , no , no , stop !
no , stop !
sorry about that .
it seems we' re in a bit of a stalemate , wouldn' t you say ?
yuck !
but i can go three days without sleep .
i can go three weeks .
ooh !
i' il stab you before i nod off .
and i' il chomp you .
marvelous , we' il kill each other .
what do you suggest ?
a truce .
get out of my mouth and let' s talk face to face .
how do i know i can trust you ?
i give you my word .
the word of a dragon .
it' s worthless .
stubborn lout !
i should have known !
go on .
kill me !
i don' t want to kill you !
i never did !
and i don' t want you to kill me !
how do we gain ?
if you win , you lose a trade .
if i win , i wait around for the next sword slinger ... thirsting to carve a reputation out of my hide .
and i' m tired of lurking in holes ... and skulking in darkness .
i' m gonna let you up now .
and if you insist ... we can pursue this fracas to its final stupidity .
or you can listen to my alternative .
hmm ?
what' s the alternative ?
father , father , look !
dragon !
out of the way !
out of the way !
out of the way !
pesky critters , dragons .
you !
like big rats .
you never seem to get rid of them .
unless you pay me two bags of gold , in advance .
come on , dragon .
come on , dragon .
yes !
ow !
hmm .
hello .
twenty eight , twenty nine .
most profitable , dragon .
i should have met you a long time ago .
there is much gold in the world .
perhaps when you' ve had your fill of it , you' il no longer need me .
i am a knight of the old code .
my word is my bond .
no compunctions then ?
about what ?
well , such deception hardly befits a knight of the old code .
fleecing einon' s lackeys .
that' s a service to mankind .
is it ?
when you squeeze the nobility , it' s the peasants who feel the pinch .
that' s not my concern .
why should i stick my neck out for people afraid to risk their own ?
don' t clutter up a clever scheme with morality .
mmm , so be it ...
knight of the old code .
if i wanted my conscience pricked , i would have stayed with the priest !
huh !
and what does a dragon know of the old code , anyway ?
his blade defends the helpless .
his might upholds the weak .
his word speaks only truth .
shut up !
i remember .
that' s all it is , a memory .
nothing can bring it back .
you sound like one who tried .
and failed .
so i no longer try to change the world , dragon .
i just try to get by in it .
yes , it' s better than death , i suppose .
oh , is it ?
i should think you' d welcome death .
you know , the last of your kind , all your friends dead , hunted wherever you go .
do you delight in reminding me ?
yes , knight , i do long for death .
but fear it .
why ?
aside from your misery , what' s to lose ?
my soul .
finish him , brok !
well , are you a man ?
should he continue , mother ?
oh , the field belongs to the apparently inexhaustible sir brok , my son .
the quarry !
first you beg mercy for your father' s fate .
then you try to avenge it .
now , you' il share it .
in your kingdom , einon , there are worse fates than death .
i' il think one up for you .
take her away .
no !
no !
he killed my father !
he killed my father !
he killed my father !
i remember you now .
i remember you .
your hair , like fire .
you gave me this scar .
didn' t you ?
i ... owe ... you .
i can , uh
i really can .
sorry , bowen .
i hope you like it well done .
you must have hated us very much .
i hated one of you .
these i killed because i wanted to kill him .
but i never found him .
i never will .
if you' re the last , he must be dead .
oh , yes .
tell me , what was he like ... this , uh , dragon that you hated ?
he only had half a heart .
but even that was enough to pollute an innocent boy .
einon was no innocent !
he polluted the heart !
how do you know that ?
how do you know that , dragon ?
all dragons know that story .
what was to be their hope became their doom .
a spoiled , ungrateful child was given a great gift and destroyed it !
no !
i knew einon .
i was his teacher .
i taught him the ways of honor , of right .
then he betrayed you ... just as he betrayed the dragon whose heart he broke .
that' s a lie , dragon !
stop calling me " dragon " !
i have a name .
well , what is it ?
you couldn' t possibly pronounce it in your tongue .
try me .
it' s
next time stab more flesh , less cloth .
i' il pierce your heart !
you already did .
a very special heart , like no other .
a black , withered thing without pity .
then teach me .
pity me .
i' il give you everything .
even power .
you' re so beautiful .
even power .
even a throne .
oh , dear .
thank you .
it' s passed now .
what was it ?
an old complaint that acts up now and again .
forgive me if anything i said , if i upset you .
it wasn' t you , not you .
don' t be afraid .
i won' t let you suffer the same fate as me .
i' ve come to help you .
this will bring you out well below the castle walls .
thank
you .
have you been watching over me all night ?
i' ve been thinking .
yes ?
about what ?
many things .
mostly about what to call you .
i think i' ve found you a name .
you say that as though you reached up and plucked it from the sky .
i did .
up there .
do you see that group of stars ?
i know those stars very well .
do you see the shape that they make ?
mm hmm , a dragon .
yes .
they call it " draco .
it means " dragon " in the scholars ' speech .
so instead of calling me " dragon " in your tongue ... you' il call me " dragon " in some other tongue .
you' re right .
it' s silly .
no .
no , i would be honored to be named after those stars .
i i truly would .
thank you , bowen .
draco .
throw off the yoke of einon' s oppression !
we must start to fight back !
your father sang that sour tune once , and we did fight back .
and once was enough !
we' il not dance to it again !
no , hewe , just cringe like a dog under einon' s boot .
at least a cringing dog' s a live one !
hey !
why waste good food on bad rhetoric ?
i speak the truth .
truth ?
it' s rarely inspiring , lass .
and it never wins rebellions ... but it will stretch necks , if there is a neck ... underneath that little mud pie .
ready or not , here i come !
dragon !
it' s draco !
about time .
mmm !
it seems you people are in need of a dragonslayer .
where is the lord responsible for this village ?
brok lives in a big house about six miles away .
but he' il only blame any damage on us and pluck our pockets to pay for it .
i won' t pluck them as deeply .
i' il make you a fair offer .
take it , or leave him !
it' s enough you people grovel to einon .
will you be bullied by some broken down , blackmailing knight as well ?
that' s right , you don' t need me .
settle it yourself .
of course , there are other ways .
perhaps you' il part with ... one of your precious daughters , instead of gold .
dragons are partial to maiden sacrifices , i hear .
