the toccoa men , that' s the ones that was there at the very beginning .
they are very close .
they accept people coming in , like myself , as a replacement ... ... but you also had to prove yourself .
most of them were qualified parachutists .
they had to be .
a lot of them were awfully green , and we knew that .
we hoped they could keep alive .
a lot of them didn' t .
but after a while , they eventually blend right in .
i think maybe they were trying ... ... to impress the older guys , people like me or shifty .
i don' t know why , but i got to where ... ... i didn' t wanna be friendly with replacements coming in ... ... because , god , i didn' t like seeing them get killed .
it just tore me up .
we were in awe of them .
they were wearing infantry badges .
they had a star on their jump wings .
they were heroes to us .
that' s how we saw them .
and they were good .
they were good .
we had good officers , but we had excellent ncos .
they looked after you .
all right , now , lieutenant , nice and easy .
we still got a shot .
tough break .
you' re having a tough night .
sorry , george .
it' s all right .
nice shot , sir .
thank you , bull .
thank you .
heffron , finish me up .
what does he need ?
double seven .
there it is !
you' re embarrassing the lieutenant .
drink .
don' t mind if i do .
better start winning money , your pals miss you .
yeah , they do look kind of sad .
they' re just serious fighting men .
i' il introduce myself .
be careful .
don' t take much to set my guys off .
you got some wild eyed killers there .
good thing we weren' t gambling .
we' d have gotten killed .
you wanna bet ?
a pack of smokes .
i don' t know .
come on .
first one to hit the bull' s eye ?
one shot .
why not ?
make it two .
two packs .
yeah , two packs .
all right , two packs .
one shot .
hey , fellas .
what do you hear ?
what do you say ?
that' s babe' s seat .
private heffron' s .
is that right ?
i don' t care if it' s fucking eisenhower' s .
who are you ?
private miller .
james miller .
i' m in randleman' s squad .
us too .
i' m les hashey .
tony ...
garcia .
i know .
old gonorrhea don' t miss nothing .
lieutenant , you gonna shoot lefty all night ?
come on .
because he' s right handed .
what would i do without george luz ?
goodness gracious !
two packs , gentlemen .
pay up .
so heffron tell you about doris yet ?
no .
well , then i' m gonna educate you .
we' re ready to get on the plane for the first jump .
all of a sudden , heffron stops .
boom .
everybody banging into each other .
heffron' s staring at the airplane' s nose , because on it ... ... is painted this beautiful pinup .
darling doris .
doris just happens to be the name of the skirt who just that day ... ... sent babe one of them letters .
you know them ...
web , what do you call them letters ?
dear john letter .
that' s it .
a " dear babe " letter .
anyway , lucky for babe , patton overruns our drop zone .
mission canceled .
babe don' t have to risk getting inside doris again .
bull , your squad listens good .
they' re being polite , like whenever bull opens his mouth .
they' re just humoring him ?
yeah , like whenever he gives out some of his folksy farm wisdom .
probably think he' s a fucking hayseed .
ain' t that right ?
what are you laughing at ?
you new boys , you pay attention to sergeant randleman .
got that ?
that' s the smartest man in the company .
where' d you get that ?
it' s the presidential distinguished unit citation .
for what the regiment did in normandy .
right .
for what the regiment did .
you weren' t there .
ease up , cobb .
it' s a unit citation .
shit , cobb .
you didn' t fight in normandy , neither .
i got hit in the plane before i got a chance to jump .
hey , you all !
listen up !
i got us an announcement to make .
this is carwood lipton .
he' s already married , smokey .
this here is carwood lipton , the new easy company first sergeant !
as befitting his position , he says he has to make an announcement .
well , i hate to break the mood here , boys , but we' re moving out again .
as you can see ... ... this is called operation market garden .
for airborne divisions , this one' s bigger than normandy .
we' re dropping deep into occupied holland .
the allied objective is to take this road between eindhoven and arnhem ... ... so the two british armored divisions can move up it .
our job is gonna be to liberate eindhoven ... ... stay there , wait for the tanks .
the entire european advance has been put on hold for this operation .
it' s montgomery' s plan , we' il be under british command .
the good news is , if this works , these tanks will be heading into germany .
that could end the war and get us home by christmas .
intelligence doesn' t expect much opposition .
they think the krauts there are mostly kids and old men .
we should surprise them .
say goodbye to england , i don' t think they' re gonna call this one off .
what are you doing ?
look at cobb , man .
watch and learn , kids .
you wanna live , jump ready to fight .
who let you out of the hospital like that ?
they didn' t let me out .
i busted out .
i didn' t wanna get reassigned .
can you make the jump ?
sure i can , lip .
i just can' t sit .
welcome back , popeye .
thanks .
popeye went awol just in time to jump .
what' s he doing here ?
who , sobel ?
well , he' s the newly appointed regimental s 4 .
supply officer ?
yeah , you got it .
he picked me up in aldbourne .
he know you went awol ?
he knows .
he said i was lucky .
i could sit out this jump if i wanted .
i didn' t want to .
so he says , " hop in .
" hop in " ?
yeah , i couldn' t believe it .
maybe he' il court martial me later .
let' s get you some gear .
hey , mal , over there .
son of a bitch .
malarkey .
sergeant malarkey .
sir .
you thought you' d get away with it ?
what do you mean , sir ?
that motorcycle is u. s. army property .
that may not mean anything to you , but it does to me .
where' d you find it ?
that' s him , all right .
who is he , sarge ?
he was our first c. o. what happened ?
he got promoted .
just tap my leg , sergeant .
lieutenant , you' il be in the doorway .
yeah , i know .
but , look , sergeant ... ... you' il be behind me .
when the green light comes on , just tap me , all right ?
the light will be next to you .
do it .
that' s an order .
come here .
when you land , the end will hit your knee and break your jaw .
lose your reserve .
you won' t need it , we' re jumping low .
you' re fine .

grab your rifle , let' s go .
where' d you get that from , hoobler ?
