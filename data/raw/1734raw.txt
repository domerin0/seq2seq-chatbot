he just loved the lifestyle .

you' ve just fucked us !
and fucked ' em , he had .
everyone knew it was the peckham four .
there was a national witch hunt for them .
but the police were too busy nicking fare dodgers and junkie bag snatchers , while charlie and the gunman slipped across the drink towards spain .

the geezer was so hard , even his nightmares were scared of him .
what you do that for , you lunatic ?
you' ve fucked us !
we' ve gotta go on our fucking toes now .
well , good .
i hate this fucking weather , anyway .
sammy had been in gibraltar helping a flamenco singer called carlos , who was being bullied by some dutch drug smugglers that were using his house by the sea as a lookout to bring marijuana in from morocco .
everything' s gonna be all right .
if charlie was the playboy , sammy was the businessman .
and he knew if he had carlos in his pocket , he could smuggle drugs from africa himself .
carry on , charlie .
hey , i said sorry .
now leave it .
and drugs , unlike the waiter , were the future .
and that was sammy , the partner .
he was a bit like robin hood , apart from the fact he robbed anyone and gave to himself , and probably killed their familiesjust for fun .
nice fellow , eh ?
charming , don' t you think ?
and from the moment he met me , he fucking hated me .
he was only trying to serve me lunch on a dirty plate .
you know what i' m like .
you will eat in low end places , won' t you ?
low end ?
they charge an absolute fucking fortune in there .
i should have glassed every one of ' em .
sammy , this is the kid frankie .
he drives us now .
did you miss me ?
terribly .
how was gibraltar ?
ream , charl .
i' ve got this singer carlos in our pocket .
he' s even coming down the club tonight .
this little dutch firm , they' re finished .
carlos is ours .
do me a favour , go and sort yourself out and tell me about it when we get home .
you' re bleeding over the fucking deck .
darling , it' s horizontal strokes .
let me finish .
i like that bit .
what was it ?
horizontal strokes .
sorry .
listen , charl .
what ?
i really appreciate what you' ve done for me .
but ... ... maybe i should go now .
i don' t wanna get in the way here .
it' s all right , son .
you' re with me .
i told you , don' t worry about sammy .
he' s wild , but he' s got a good heart .
anyway , fuck all that bollocks .
there' s a party down at the club tonight .
i need you to drive us .
that dutch firm might show up .
wanna come for a swim , frankie ?
i' m carlos and i' m pleased to meet you .
and you , carlos .
sammy tells me you' ve got a little problem we might be able to help you with .
i' m hoping so , please .
you' re with us now , son .
you ain' t gotta worry about them fucking dutch mugs any more .
we' il take care of that for you .
i' ve gotta tell you , you look better on the lp covers than you do in the flesh .
what happened ?
you look fucked .
ah , los banderos ingleses .
what' s he say ?
he said you are criminals from england .
tell him to fuck off .
no , no , no , whoa .
no .
offer him some champagne .
from us .
go on .
that' s the mayor .
looks like a fucking iron .
he probably is .
ingleses , muchas gracias .
you' re welcome .
oh !
sammy , the dutch are in the club .
danny , the dutch are here .
let' s go !
ronnie , they' re here !
come on .
move it !
go and sit in the corner .
we' ve got aggro , charles .
the dutch .
charles , cop for it .
no .
not in here .
i wasn' t that stupid .
i knew the difference between right and wrong and i knew i should have gone , right there and then .
but as much as i was out of my depth , something kept pulling me back .
give us a kiss .
give us a kiss !
come here , boy .
put that out .
right , here are the rules .
you take her shopping , you let her get what she wants .
you take her to lunch , you let her eat what she wants .
but you take her to a bar drinking and that' s when we fall out .
i get back from gibraltar and i find she' s drunk , i' m gonna fucking kill you .
we understand each other ?
and one last thing , you even think about trying to get hold of her ...
sammy , i' d never do that .
she' s your lady .
all right .
we' il be back just before sunset .
ok .
good luck with the dutch .
shut your mouth about the dutch .
it' s nothing to do with you .
while sammy and charlie went to make a deal with the dutch ,
i had to look after the snake .
the way she fucked with people' s heads , i should have stayed in bed .
would you like to see the menu ?
a bottle of bollinger , please .
no .
please .
no .
one glass .
no .
i' il tell sammy you raped me .
one glass .
a bottle , please .
fuck !

shut up a minute .
they' re back .
how are you supposed to drive me in that ?
are you sober ?
can i smell your breath ?
it' s all right .
remember , you haven' t had a drink .
maybe .
dirty fucking dutch !
liberty taking ...
hi , darling .
hey , charlie .
you seen what they' ve done to the merc ?
what' s happened to you ?
they' ve fucking shot the car to pieces , that' s what they' ve done .
get danny and ronnie and tell them we need them at the club tonight .
oi !
i said , get danny and ronnie and get yourself back here .
we need to check this lot' s working .
you' re bleeding everywhere .
you' d better get up the hospital .
five is a prime number , innit , charl ?
don' t fucking drive me mad , sam .
it' s half down to you that i' ve got this .
i asked you , what about the dutch firm ?
are they heavy ?
do we do business with them ?
no , not you .
not sammy brooks .
he wants to run around fucking killing people .
what do you reckon , boys ?
nice , eh ?
not the espadrilles .
you need heels , babe .
i' m obviously not gonna wear it with fucking espadrilles .
i was just showing you .
sweet ?
amazing .
ain' t nothing getting through these vests .
good .
try it on me .
yeah ?
how far ?
from about where you was .

sammy ?
sammy ?

might start wearing one of these all the time , charl .
you should do .
it' il help you sleep better .
it' s like a kick up the bollocks , charl .
it' s a blinder .
here you are .
you try it .
what ?
put the vest on .
sammy , what are you doing ?
what ?
fuck .
this is fucking madness .
i don' t want to ...
oh , shut up !
here , are you all right ?
kid ?
are you all right , son ?
come on .
are you all right ?

he' s all right .

don' t worry , son .
you' il live .
what' s the matter ?
you' re off , ain' t you ?
it' s just that ...
i' m just ...
it' s all right , don' t worry .
you ain' t gotta explain nothing to me .
it' s just , it ain' t a bit of me , charl .
i ain' t one of yous .
here , look , come here .
here , take it .
any time you want a holiday , you come and see me , all right ?
don' t , don' t worry about it .
don' t worry about it .
you just make sure you come and see me again .
you' il be all right , you know that , don' t you ?
am i ?
course you fucking are .
you' ve got character .
anyway , look , i' ve gotta go and sort out these dutch cunts .
i' il see you later .
take care .
ta ta .
the way i saw it , it was go back to london and wank my life away playing donkey kong in the kebab house or sign up to a life of crime , women and drugs .
what else was i gonna fucking do ?
it' s eight miles straight across from morocco to gibraltar .
every night , we had one chance when the navy patrol boats were far enough apart for us to sneak our dinghies full of drugs through the middle .
and it weren' t easy , our line of work .
cos you had to get up around five , have some paella , if you' re lucky , a bit of shrimp , then wait for night .
we prayed for clouds so they could give us that extra bit of cover .
even then , sammy was the only one that made the call .
sometimes we misjudged the timings of the patrol boats .
and as i wiped moroccan kids' brains off me , i questioned my morals .
but with the amount of money at stake and sammy breathing down my neck , there was no time for regret .
it ain' t good news .
we' ve lost a few of ' em .
oh , well , you live and learn .
unless you' re a dead kid .
it was danny and ronnie' sjob to get the puff from the dealers ,
load up the boats with the barrels and make sure the mules headed in the right direction .
unless it was ramadan .
fucking holy month costs us fortunes , because parents wouldn' t let their kids go , even when we doubled their carry money .
but we got round it .
we went to the orphanages .
sammy was the eye in the sky and everything went on his order .
he was the only one that could give the green light .
me and charlie were on beach patrol .
it was ourjob to make sure the kids didn' t run off with our drugs .
they' re thieving cunts , moroccans , it' s in their blood .
so we' d grab ' em out the dinghies , sling ' em in the back of our van before they could run off , then we' d drive into the linea , switch lorries and send the puff off to madrid to be sealed .
the bath is empty .
i repeat , the bath is empty .
go !
go !
come on , then , you little fucking pikeys !
come on !
come on , venga !
venga !
with the dutch out the way , we changed the way drugs were smuggled into england .
we slashed the prices and drove them through the continent .
our operation grew so big , i was bringing my mates down to help .
i lived to regret it cos , like moroccans , south londoners are thieving cunts and couldn' t keep their hands to themselves .
fuck frankie !
and the ginger cunt .
he looks like ronald mc fucking donald .
you shoot your mate in the foot , you can go .
if not , ronnie' il shoot you in the foot .
sam , please , i can' t shoot him , he' s my fucking pal .
ronnie !
all right , all right .
leave it out , dan .
i' ve known you since i was five .
fucking hell .
i' m sorry , mate , i' ve gotta do it or i' m gonna get fucking shot .
look what you made me do .
sorry , mate .
argh !
fuck !
oh , fuck .
ronnie !
leave it out , sam .
they' re kids .
argh !
fucking hell !
and you , you' d get one right through the fucking nut if you wasn' t charlie' s boy .
the funny thing was , as my life got bigger , my world got smaller .
the more money we made , the less time we spent enjoying it .
sammy cut away anyone he didn' t need .
every day above ground was a result around him .
no one was safe .
i' m telling you , fucking no one .
sam , there' s a geezer out front wants to see you .
who is it ?
one of the mayor' s lot .
hello , english .
how are you ?
what do you fucking want ?
the mayor is having a dinner party at his residence this evening .
he has requested your company .
what for ?
that' s between you and him .
a party , eh ?
we expect you at six .
it' s glamorous casual .
tell your man we' il be there .
ok .
i tell my man you' il be there .
whatever .
come on .
listen , we can' t exactly blank him .
we' il make a night of it .
what' s fucking glamorous casuals , anyway ?
i' d better dust my tux off , eh ?
what for ?
for the party .
no need to bother , dan .
oh , yeah , sam ?
why' s that ?
what do you think , ron ?
what' s that mean ?
you dropping us ?
no one' s dropping anyone .
but some things are for us only .
all right ?
i thought we were all partners .
well , we fucking well ain' t partners , ron .
you and your pal are on the payroll .
so don' t start getting fucking lemon .
there was never talk of partnerships .
you both fucking knew the deal and we' ve looked after you .
sammy , are you fucking winding us up ?
no , i' m not winding you up , ron .
ronnie , come on .
let' s go .
what do you reckon ?
fuck ' em .
they' re gonna have to swallow .
listen , frank , this ain' t like the real world .
every cunt on this coast is your pal when you' re looking after ' em .
the next day , they wanna fuck you , and the day after that , they wanna be your pal again .
it' s a fucking dog business .
what about you ?
me ?
i' m different .
fucking hell , kid .
this is where you wanna be .
three years , this' il be mine .
nice gun .
tell the mayor he' s got a fantastic place here .
ask him if we can rent one of the wings .
le gusta tu casa .
dice que , " es posible arrendar un ala aqu ?
lo primero que me interesa saber es qu es lo que estn trayendo en los botes aquellos ?
what' s he say ?
he said , " thank you .
and ?
he would like to know what are you bringing on the boats ?
what boats ?
dice , " qu botes ?
dile que , en este mundo , todo se puede arreglar si uno conoce la gente clave .
he say anything is possible if you know the right people .
amigos ?
amigos .
ok .
una cosa ms .
y es muy importante .
con la coca , no .
marijuana , ningn problema .
siguen trayendola , bueno .
pero , si con la coca , hay problema .
there is one thing you must know .
the cocaine .
you must never bring it onto his coast .
the marijuana is ok .
but if you sell the cocaine , it is a problem .
and if there is a problem , you lose .
buenos amigos , eh ?
amigos .
ese chico me lo sientan al lado para la cena ?
he' s saying he would like to sit next to you for dinner .
tell him it' s ok .
what do you reckon ?
i think we should knock down that wall .
whatever you want .
get rid of all that spanishified shit .
i want red , black and chrome everywhere .
see that terracotta ?
it' s gotta go .
i want marble throughout .
my gun cabinet ?
can' t you put them under the bed ?
that should take care of it .
now fuck off out of my house .
he means it .
now , be careful , there' s a day' s money in there .
go on .
and keep the change , you toby .
i think that was out , charl .
sammy , it was in .
no , that' s ...
carl ?
ace .
no , it was out , charl .
it was in .
it was fucking out !
don' t fucking cheat !
cunt .
sammy , it was in !
i ain' t playing , charl .
i ain' t playing no more , charlie .
and you .
you sad fuck .
come on , mate .
with the mayor on our side , we fucking smashed it .
as long as we wet his beak and stayed away from cocaine , he loved us .
while the english police sat around scratching their canisters wondering how we did it , we opened the club for sunday lunch , sat back and enjoyed our roast . ihola !
magazine .
leave off , sam , please .
we only wanna have a bit of roast dinner .
we don' t know what we' re supposed to have done .
sammy , come on , it' s sunday .
fuck ' em , charl , they' re not welcome .
come on , sammy , sit down .
come on .
it' s all right , lads .
sit down , enjoy your dinner .
don' t worry about him .
come on , sit down .
come on .
oh , here we go .
oh , look at it .
cunt .
ain' t got a bit of class .
thinks it' s the bollocks cos its old man' s warm .
i think she' s lovely .
you' re just jealous .
fuck off !
shut up .
what do you know ?
it' s just a brass .
that' s rich .
charlie , frankie , come here .
come here .
i' d give a grand to fuck you , boy .
if you thought that was bad , it was nothing compared to what the chef said .
we' ve run out of lamb .
you' re joking ?
come here .
charl .
what ?
see the state of these feet .
come here .
go on , girls !
wahay !
come on , ronnie !
here , you wanna sort your old woman out !
go on , love , give it the old ...
hi , charlie .
how is he ?
please don' t blow him out .
you all right , mate ?
yeah .
you ?
like my pool ?
yeah , it' s lovely .
what are we gonna do , charl ?
can we just wipe our mouth and move on ?
no .
i can' t just wipe my mouth .
listen , sam , you got carly , you got your place up here .
we' re moving in different directions now .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
it means i wanna do my own thing for a while , see how it goes .
just cos i nicked your watch for a fucking laugh ?
it' s not a fucking laugh , sam .
you planted it on frankie and he' s my mate .
well , you' ve only known that cunt five minutes .
i' ve known you all my fucking life , charl .
don' t make this difficult , sam .
i' il still be about .
i just wanna do my own thing for a bit .
don' t give me them eyes .
the good thing about drugs is they make you feel good .
the bad thing about drugs is they make you greedy .
what is it ?
the future .
cocaine .
pure .
what about the mayor ?
fuck the mayor .
what do you reckon , kid ?
good buzz ?
fantastic .
my cock' s shrunk and i can' t feel my neck .
what' s the plan ?
well , i' ve got the colombians sweet , i' ve got the pilots sweet ,
i' ve got the drop zone sweet .
now all we need to do is get the fucking mayor sweet .
come on , kid , think .
this is worth fortunes .
how about we stick someone into the mayor ?
a sacrifice .
who' s gonna do that ?
think about it .
he likes boys .
my mate sonny , a right skaghead in london , right , absolute fucking heroin addict .
you know what they' re like when they' re clucking .
they' il do anything for a fix .
exactly .
can he be got ?
what a fucking amazing plan , eh ?
cocaine junkie rent boys and a corrupt mayor .
and this is how it was gonna work .
flying the white from colombia straight to london was too hot by now .
so the south americans had more produce than they could shift .
that' s where we came in .
they' d fly it as far as morocco and , from there , we' d switch planes and run it across the gibraltar straits like before .
but it weren' t like marijuana .
we couldn' t afford to lose one package .
it was worth too much .
but if our sacrifice worked and we kept the mayor sweet ... ... we' d wind up with more money than we could dream of .
ah , i' m so pleased you invited me down here , frankie .
i don' t know how i' il be able to repay you .
i' m sure you' il find a way .
so , what was it you said you wanted me to do ?

we had more coke than we could handle .
the more we sent back home , the more they wanted it .
and by 1987 , london was covered in a white blanket .
every fucking one was at it .
from city boys to rent boys , yuppie girls to call girls .
there were even stories of the royals getting stuck in , banging it up their fucking noses .
maybe that' s why she called her son charlie .
and how do you think she survived on four hours' sleep a night ?
in our own little way , we were shaping the future of our country .
after cocaine , it would never be the same .
it brought us together , pulled us apart , made us sell our souls as well as our mates .
it was a glorious time .
and as long as we kept this old bastard happy and sonny did hisjob , it was never gonna end .
he say you have the face of a film star .
well , tell him , i said thanks .
and i' ve actually been thinking about getting into acting when i get home .
dice que gustara ser un actor .

it sounds like a load of bollocks to me , sitting around , waiting for fucking algerian sailors with green hats , bags of gear in run down ports .
leave me out .
qu gillipollas .
cerveza .
a funny thing .
it' s a lot quieter on the way down than the journey up .
no one wants you around when you' ve got nothing left .
i wanted out so badly but i couldn' t just walk away with nothing .
freeze !
jesus !
charl .
what' s happened to you ?
you all right , sonny ?
you look like you' ve gone right to the front .
i took your old bar on , charl .

where' s frankie ?
he' s on his way back from cdiz .

i don' t see anyone .
not after what happened .
what about my sammy ?
you hear things , but no , i ain' t seen him in years .
i just keep my nut down .
if it weren' t so hot , i' d say come down there for a drink .
yeah ?
maybe i will .
they still want you here .
i' d give it a wide .
tell you what .
we' il have a reunion party .
what for ?
what do you mean , what for ?
i can pull a crowd like you' ve never seen before , son .
i' m not saying that .
i don' t know , charl .
it' s just ...
i don' t know , charlie .
yeah , yeah .
that' s what we' il do .
we' il get the old firm back for a night .
be fucking blinding .
it' s changed down there , charl .
i don' t mean no offence , but you can' t just steam in .
no offence ?
i ain' t just fucking steaming in , boy .
that club' s still mine .
well , legally it' s mine , actually .
hark at him , all the long words now .
come on , son , it' il be blinding .
one little night .
for old times ' sake .
listen , you go and sort out the balloons , and i' m gonna put the word out that i' m back .
who to ?
fucking everyone !
just like the old days , eh ?
yeah , like the old days .
i nearly got my throat cut in cdiz , charl .
don' t that tell you anything ?
listen ...
get loads of balloons , pink ones .
i like them fucking massive ones with " party " written on them .
don' t buy the kiddy ones , they' re a waste of money .
oh , and er ... find out where sammy lives .
i want to surprise him .
the good thing about losing everything was there was nothing else to lose .
i had one last plan , one last person who could help me .
whether she liked it or not ... we had unfinished business .
so it' s not just a rumour .
what ?
you do look like shit .
thanks .
how would you know ?
i always ask after you .
if that' s true , why did you fuck me over ?
you didn' t need me to fuck your life , frankie .
you did that yourself .
frankie ...
i can' t work you out .
i' ve got to go .
sammy' il be wondering where i am .
is that it ?
read it .
right , let' s have a look at you .
fucking hell , look at the state of you .
come here .
that' s it .
that' s better .
right .
you look terrific .
what about me ?
ream , charl .
you look ream .
yeah .
have a look at this .
look at that .
got it ?
we' re still the bollocks .
come on , let' s get out there .
listen , have you got the gun sorted out ?
just make sure it' s empty , all right ?
all right .
maybe i should have driven across the border there and then .
gone through the slips while i still could .
but there was one thing left i had to take care of .
and if the plan was right , i was going to enjoy it more than the first time i got high .
did someone order a cunt ?
cos one' s just showed up .
listen , i' ve got a bit of work .
do you want in ?
why shouldn' t i just kill you ?
cos i' ve got a drop lined up .
what sort of drop ?
a large one .
white .
why come to me ?
you' re the only one that knows what they' re doing .
go and wait by the gate .
carly , get me a pistol .
something i can hide .
it' s got a full clip .
what do you want it for ?
never mind .
give us a kiss .
frankie , listen .
i know we ain' t got along too well over the years , had our ups and downs , but i really appreciate the fact that we can do a bit of business together now .
to be honest , you was the first person i thought of .
you' re the only one i can trust .
i really appreciate that .
you' re a good kid .
i hope this is the start of something new for us .
how much did you say there was ?
lt' il be worth the walk .
we ain' t got to get in there , have we ?
that' s where it' s coming .
it' s other people' s shit and piss .
they won' t mind .
here you are , get ready for them .
they' re coming .
look .
there must be more .
i don' t believe it , sam , this is it .
is this what it' s come to ?
i' ve sniffed more than this in one day .
we had it all once , sam , and it' s come to this .
we really fucked it !
not me , boy .
you fucked it .
bitch !
get out of the water .
drop your weapons .
give yourselves up .
hands in the air .
the maddest thing about crime is it' s like a drug .
you never know when to stop .
as much as i wanted the fairy tale ending with her ... ... i wanted it all for myself as well .
you might want to check that , what with my track record .
i just did .
what for ?
you can' t kill me .
you' re a fucking loser like the rest of them .
trust me , if you don' t pull the trigger , i' il be seeing you again .
you wish , bitch .
remember that letter my old man wrote from prison , about staying away from crime , women and drugs ?
what a load of bollocks that turned out to be .
i tried the lot and won , and drove off into the sunset .
