oh , boy .

townsville will not stand for this .

city being destroyed ?
where are you going ?
oh , boy .
mayor , where are you going ?
we' re in a serious pickle .
exactly .
girls , no !
hello .
hello .
the usual , cucor .
i have a fine vintage for you here .
picked fresh today .
oh , boy !
girls , girls , are you okay ?
tag !
you' re it , professor !
okay , girls .
girls , it' s almost bedtime , okay ?
girls ?
come on , professor , you' re it .
you gotta catch us .
yes , i suppose i do , don' t i ?
got you , you little bunny .
help !
i got caughted !
blossom , watch out !
you' re the sole survivor !
no way , professor !
you can' t catch me .
yes , i can because the game' s over , and it' s your bedtime .
now come up here so we can catch you .
well now , three little girls had a very busy day today , didn' t they ?
yeah , it was fun .
we met lots of kids .
and we learned things .
and we played tag !
i' m glad you had so much fun because tomorrow will be busy too .
put your nighties on and get in bed .
we need to talk about something .
okay , everybody in ?
yep , what' s up , daddy o ?
well , it' s your super powers .
i' m not sure how to say this ... ... but i don' t think you should use them in public anymore .
why ?
well , your powers are very special and unique ... ... and although we have a lot of fun doing things in the house ... ... out in townsville , people don' t understand how special you girls are .
and unfortunately , people often get scared or angry ... ... when they don' t understand something special or unique .
that' s silly .
i think so too , but nonetheless , take it easy with the powers tomorrow .
just give townsville a little time to understand your specialness , okay ?
okay .
okay .
yeah .
people are nice .
things will be fine .
so i' il be waiting here to pick you up when school gets out , okay ?
okay , but don' t worry , professor .
things are gonna be fine .
girls , we didn' t know if you' d be joining us today .
take your seats .
i' m sorry to say there won' t be any recess for a while ... ... due to all the reconstruction .
secondly , i' m afraid we won' t have any lights or water for a while .
and a broken refrigerator means snack time is out ... ... so let' s try to ignore all the workmen and noise and such ... ... and get right to work , shall we ?
girls , can you recite the alphabet for us ?
girls ?
abcs ?
a , b , c , d ....
e !
hey , galldang it !
you done darn broke my board .
flamdanggling consarglers .
f ....
almost time to pick up the girls .
better motor .
that' s him , boys !
he' s in cahoots with the evil pickle cart killers ... ... cucumber crushers , vinegar varlets , dill stroyers !
why , it' s not kosher !
it' s
let it go , mayor .
let it go .
are these your babies ?
yes , but they were just playing .
they' re really very good little girls .
and i need to pick them up from school .
i understand , sir ... ... but we want you to come downtown with us to ask you a few questions .
you guys , my kids .
i really ought to pick them up .
i can' t just leave them there ... ... alone .
he' s not coming .
he hates us .
he totally hates us .
no , he probably just got held up , or maybe the car broke ... ... or maybe he forgot ... ... or maybe he hates us .
come on , let' s try and find our way home .
we' re not supposed to use our powers .
come on , girls .
the cause ?
three super powered little girls .
should manufacturing super powered children be illegal ?
a great travesty has befallen our beloved city .
i was easing the seat back when this atomic punk flies in with no warning .
the devastation ?
devastating .
it should be illegal .
used to be a time when you could buy an honest pickle .
they were lighting up the sky .
estimated dollars in damages ?
a whopping 25 million .
i' m offended just looking at them .
the kind that you can only find at a pickle cart .
now jamie' s crying .
well , it seems that  hatred is running rampant for
those mutant , bug eyed  pickle cart killing
freaks .
back to you , linda .
they are little freaks , aren' t they ?
with more on this subject is
get them out .
we don' t need them .
we don' t need them .
we interrupt this program for a news flash .
arrested in connection with the tag incident ... ... was the scientist responsible for creating the girls , professor utonium .
please , just let me go .
my girls , they need me .
they don' t know i' m in jail .
what if they try to go home themselves ?
they can' t find their way if they don' t fly .
please , they' re only little girls who are probably cold , scared ... ... and maybe even lost .
well , it' s official .
i have no idea where we are .
well , i can' t say it' s been the best day .
but it probably couldn' t get much worse .
hey , it' s okay .
maybe there' s a box we can get in around back .
come on .
see , there' s a whole bunch of boxes .
what' s the matter ?
did somebody get lost ?
wow , thanks !
hey , wait !
come back .
hey , guys , over here .
hi .
what' s your name ?
i' m blossom .
buttercup .
and i' m bubbles .
go away , please .
do not look at me .
we just wanted to thank you for saving us from those gangsters .
that was amazing with the trashcan lid .
it was all : swoosh , bang , splash , bam , boom .
yeah , you rock .
no , please .
i dare not listen ... ... for i have been lashed by harsh tongues for too long .
alas , my little ones , i do not rock .
for i , jojo , am a monster .
you' re not a monster .
monsters are evil .
anybody who would save us like you did is so not evil .
you' re no monster , mister .
you' re just really dirty .
please .
you' re just trying to make me feel better .
but my pain is not for you to understand .
besides , how could you ?
for you are pure and innocent and , most certainly , loved .
how could you know what it is to be cast out ... ... into a world that only offers misery ?
how could you know what it' s like for people to fear and despise you ... ... for the very things that make you special ... ... because you don' t fit in , because you are ... ... a freak ? !
because ... ... we' re freaks too .
what amazing powers !
no , they' re terrible .
i bet everyone hates them .
yeah .
and they hate you too .
yes .
i am in the same boat .
this brain is full of brilliant ideas .
but will anyone listen ?
no .
nothing in this gray matters .
so , what' s the point ?
jojo , don' t be sad .
our dad says people get angry when they don' t understand ... ... something special or unique .
if you just give people time , they' il start to understand your specialness .
yeah .
you just gotta believe in yourself .
if i construct my help the town and make it a better place machine ... ... people will come to understand my specialness ?
i' il do it , but i' il need your help .
jump in , take this device into the volcano .
we need to harness the energy of the earth' s core for power .
what are you talking about ?
the plan .
what plan ?
our plan .
to do what ?
to make the town better .
what ?
you know .
we will build the help the town and make it a better place machine .
everyone will see our special abilities are good .
they will love us .
remember ?
it was your idea .
oh , yeah .
but use our powers ?
yes .
no way .
come on .
no .
we' re never using our powers again .
girls , don' t be sad .
your powers are great .
you just gotta believe in yourself .
yes !
yes !
yes !
we did good ?
you did very good .
very good indeed .
now what do we do ?
we construct the superstructure .
look .
can' t you see our plan is working ?
our work is proceeding as planned .
at last , our lives will be better .
at last , we will be accepted .
at last , our greatest work is comple
oops .
what' s wrong ?
well ... ... there is one last teeny tiny , itsy bitsy thing we still need .
yes !
yes !
yes !
we did good ?
you did very good .
very good indeed .
now what do we do ?
well , because you' ve done so good ... ... i' ve got a special surprise .
worthless .
lame .

okay .

i mean , time to go .
but , jojo ....
we haven' t seen the gazelles .
or the crocodiles .
or the unicorns .
just one unic
excuse me , ma' am .
i think you dropped this .
i thought the zoo kept all the animals in cages .
yeah , well , you' re welcome , lady .
don' t listen , bubbles .
that' s right , bubbles , do not listen .
all of you , deafen yourselves to their heartless words .
they do not know it is their saviors they are speaking to .
they are unaware your actions will have helped change their world forever .
because we have helped the town and made it a better place .
you think they' il be surprised ?
oh , yeah .
will they still be mad at us for playing tag ?
no , they' il have forgotten all about that .
will they love us ?
yes .
really ?
would i lie to you ?
i' m so excited !
we' il show them !
hey , where' s ?
professor !
girls , thank goodness you' re okay .
i' m so sorry .
i' m a terrible , terrible parent .
you must hate me for not picking you up from school , but it' s not my fault .
it' s this town .
they' ve gone crazy .
it' s like they' ve never seen kids playing before .
i knew your powers would take some getting used to .
but jail ?
lawsuits ?
angry mobs ?
what' s next ?
don' t worry , professor .
things are gonna get better .
we promise .
today' s the day .
today' s the day !

what ?
we' re gonna show townsville just what our powers can really do .
we did something really good .
that' s gonna really
help !
well , we met this guy .
with powers like us .
who was also hated by everybody .
but he had this great idea .
to help the town .
and make it a better place .
that way the town would accept us .
we did something to help .
so we used all our powers .
and abilities .
and his ideas .
to help everybody .
city of townsville ...
it' s gonna be so cool . ... i' d like to take this moment ...
you' re gonna be so proud . ... to thank the little people ...
everyone' s gonna love us . ... who helped to make this day a smashing success .
we did really goo
blossom , bubbles and buttercup , i couldn' t have done it without you .
it' s their fault !
i knew they were no good !
what happened ?
this isn' t making the town a better place .
yes , it is , for me .
the hobo formerly known as " jojo " is no more .
mojo jojo !
for too long , apes and monkeys have been under the thumb of man .
the world !
professor , we didn' t want this .
liars .
fibbers .
you' ve doomed us all .

i don' t know who to believe .
i thought you were good .

i rock !
i rock so hard .
for i , mojo jojo , have succeeded ... ... in my first , greatest and most brilliant plan ever .
and i , mojo jojo , shall be ... ... king of the planet of the apes !
you shall be king ?
preposterous .
what ?
how dare you .
for it is i who is the one most suited to be ruler .
those are my clothes .
i , ojo tango , shall be simian supreme .
no ojo .
mojo .
as i unleash the offensive omnipotence of the oppressive orango tank .
hold on .
oh , no !
i shall get a grip on the situation .
you better not .
as i , rocko socko , seize control and rule .
wait !
i , baboon kaboom ... ... with my baboom bot , will be the bomb .
and if you don' t like it ... ... you can sniff my baboom bot bombs .
that' s classy .

for we , the gogo po trol ... ... form a chain of command that will take hold of your world .
i , hota wata , am boiling mad , for you are all wet behind the ears .
so i shall unleash a scalding torrent to drown you out , for i don' t give a

that jerk , that big , fat , dumb jerk .
he duped us .
he planned it all along , and we fell for it .
and now , everybody hates us even more .

i' m building a house because now we have to live here .
live here ?
yeah , don' t you see ?
this can be the bedroom , and this is my bed .
that can be your bed over there .
i don' t wanna sleep on a rock !
maybe if someone hadn' t pushed bubbles into the school ....
look , she speaks .
maybe if somebody hadn' t insisted on walking home ... ... so we could run into the biggest liar in the universe !
we weren' t allowed to use our powers , and you know it !
look , it' s miss goody goody .
we weren' t gonna get people to stop hating us by breaking rules .
yeah .
and using our super powers ... ... to make a help the town and make it a better place machine ... ... was following rules ? !
i didn' t see you putting up a fight .

this is hopeless !
i know .

i didn' t mean it !
it was an accident !
he wouldn' t let go !
and the dog .
that stupid dog , and then the monkeys , and he
i couldn' t he couldn' t oh , man !
buttercup !
you' re a genius !
i am ?
she is ?
yeah .
the one way to stop the monkeys , save the town and find the professor ... ... is to use our powers to
better yet , watch !
wow !
that was amaz hey !
gross !
cut it out .
come on , girls .
let' s put an end to this gorilla warfare .
good one , bubbles .
girls  shut up !
i was afraid of this .
they' ve returned and found out what their powers can really do .
come .
you will make a good " power proof " vest .
none of those monkeys had professor !
where could he be ?
take a good guess !
come on , girls !
we' ve got one last monkey to get off our backs !
not so fast ... ... mojo jojo !
look at the little heroes here to save their daddy !
no , girls !
save yourselves !
sorry , professor !
we can take this chump chimp down !
nothing he can do can stop us !
that' s better .
it' s good you little freaks know when you' re beaten .
now if you' il excuse me , i , mojo jojo , have a town to take over !
i have a world to rule !
i have to seize control of an area ... ... and force its inhabitants to follow my way of thinking !
even if it means ... ... taking extreme measures !
you wouldn' t !
i would !
professor !
now i am more mojo than before !
now , as i was saying before i was so rudely interrupted ... ... i , mojo jojo , have succeeded ... ... in my first , greatest and most brilliant plan ever !
and i , mojo jojo ... ... shall be king !
girls , thank goodness you' re okay .
now let' s get out of this town !
it' s no use .
we already tried running away .
we have to fix the problem we helped start .
you said to give everyone time to understand our specialness .
well , now it' s time for everyone to understand .
especially mojo !
surrender now , and we' il go easy on you !
down here !
oh , my !
you' re actually trying to stop me ?
that' s so cute !
try , nothing !
we will stop you !
who are you calling " cute " ?
okay , let' s play !
buttercup !
good job , girls !
that more mojo is no more !
girls !
somebody' s mad .
look out !
oh , no , look !
mojo' s got blossom pinned down !
i have an idea .
come on !
do you think he' s finished ?
no , but you are !
fools !
you dare to challenge me ?
attempt to defeat me ?
try to destroy me ? !
i , who saved you from certain death ?
after all i' ve done for you , you betray me ?
and why ?
for them ?
the ones who hated you ....
have forsaken you ?
can' t you see ?
none of them will ever understand you as i can .
for we are kindred spirits , whose powers spring from the same source .
so , girls , do not make me destroy you .
for we are smarter , we are stronger !
we are invincible !
we have the power !
we are superior to them !
and we shall rule !
all we have to do is work together .
girls , join me .
no !
we' d never join you , and it' s because we are stronger .
because we are invincible .
because we have the power !
we have to protect them from you !
it' s you who has to be feared .
because you are a monster !
you are evil !
and you are ... ... it !
curses !
girls , you were right !
we should stop mojo , and i know how !
i whipped up an antidote to chemical x !
it' il do away with his powers !
i' m so sorry for doubting you .
you are good little girls , and i love you !
we love you too !
and we' re really sorry .
we messed up really bad .
but we' re ready , professor .
ready ?
to take the antidote x to get rid of our powers .
if it wasn' t for them , none of this would have happened .
and maybe everyone would like us more if we were just normal little girls .
no !
don' t do that ... ... because that was pretty cool , with the ....
girls , i think what the mayor is trying to say is ... ... we' re sorry , and thank you .
yes , that was super , just super !
amazing !
fantastic !
wonderful !
stupendous !
you rock !
thank you .
that was awesome !
you were all flying and running !
and then , laser eyes !
then , bam !
and then and then , bam , you punched that guy !
remember ?
yeah , that was great .
you know , this town stinks .
and i was wondering if , maybe sometime ... ... we could , like , call you to save the day or whatever .
can we , professor ?
well , i don' t know ....
okay , but only if it' s before your bedtime .
help !
sugar , spice and everything nice .
these were the ingredients chosen to create the perfect little girl .
chemical x.
thus blossom , bubbles and buttercup were born !
using their ultra super powers , they' ve dedicated their lives ... ... to fighting crime and the forces of evil .
the powerpuff girls !
hey , that' s a good name for them .
powerpuff girls , yeah !
i like that .
wonder if they will .
i' il run it by them .
powerpuff girls !
