and this guy was drinking this beer ... and i remember it was in a blue bottle .
and i was real mad at kurt because ... he blew me offagain to hang out with his friends .
so i had a few beers .
i had more than a few .
this guy , you know , he seemed he seemed real nice ... cause when i couldnt walk , he offered to drive me home .
its no big deal , luce .
it happens to girls all the time .
did you go to the police ?
no .
im from a trailer park .
i got drunk and got in his car .

oh , my god .
its okay , iil go .
im sorry .
god !
be careful , lucy .

ive been in a car full ofchicks .
do you have any idea what its like being surrounded by girls ?
being a girl yourself , i know , stupid question .
but im a guy , okay ?
im a guy . just a guy .
and i have been listening to girl talk and watching you do ... your girl things for days .
im not complaining , cause , lets face it , im outnumbered .
but thats my car .
its my car , and itsjust
its the one thing that hasnt been taken over by chicks .
okay ?
okay .
ben ?
yeah ?
were you really in jail ?
yeah , i was .
so you killed a guy ?
what ?
who said i killed a guy ?
everybody back home .
oh , man .
no , i didnt kill a guy .
what did you do then ?
i was in college , and i get this call from my stepsister .
she wants me to come get her cause my stepdad is beating her up .
my mom cant stop him , so ...
i drive home in the middle ofthe night ... and she throws her things out the window and climbs out ... and then i drive her back to school in ohio with me .
and you went tojail for that ?
thats the thing .
theres this law ... against driving a child thats not a relative across state lines ... and my stepdad ofcourse pressed charges .
but , you know , its okay .
i only got six months ... and i had to stay in ohio for a years probation .
my sister got to go live with her mom .
you all really thought i killed a guy ?
yeah .
what were you thinking getting into a car with a homicidal maniac ?
why are we stopping ?
youil see .
mimi , you okay ?
oh , yeah , im fine .
look .
its like you have to whisper .
hello !
man .
we gotta make time .
the next hotel is still an hour away .
ben , do you have enough sleeping bags for all of us ?
you serious ?
you really want to camp here ?
yeah .
it sounds like fun .
you gotta keep your thumb on the outside like this .
right .
now , the trick is ... you dont want to let him know that youre gonna hit him .
maybe like look away first .
and then , when he least expects it , you throw your whole body into it .
what are you doing to her ?
im teaching her how to fight because every girl ... should know how to throw a decent punch .
that was decent .
im gonna go to bed .
im gonna go to the ladies room .
where is it again ?
third bush after the rock over there .
this one ?
that one , yeah .
what are you always writing in there ?
poems , mostly .
can i hear one ?
okay .
one .
but you cant laugh .
i used to think i had the answers to everything ... but now i know that life doesnt always go my way .
it feels like im caught in the middle , and thats when i realize ... that im not a girl , and not yet a woman .
all i need is time , just a moment thats mine .
and while im in between , im not a girl .
i liked it .
really ?
yeah , really , i like it .
what ?
you got ash on your face .
where ?
iil get it .
there .
whats wrong ?
what happened ?
something bit my ass .
let me see .
its a snake bite .
no , mimi , thats a mosquito bite .
