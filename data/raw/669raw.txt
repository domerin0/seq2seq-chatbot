of course it' s the chemicai process .
weil .
weil , you have some iate memories ?
why' d i have these memories ?
brother , i don' t know .
but there' s some questions you should be asking yourself .
now , the question you should be asking yourself first , why did you give our pai that money ?
90 miilion doilars .
nobody ... in three years .
okay , forget about it .
think backward .
they told me that i was working ... by someone named decker .
decker ?
yeah .
wiiliam decker ?
i think so .
what i heard was he was working on something ievei 5 ... shut him down .
what was it ? ... a iaser .
what reason ?
90 miilion doilars just ...
what ?
it' s no way i get escaped from the room without the cigarettes and the glasses .
i' d never have got another bus without the bus ticket , and ... ... if i don' t have the diamond ring ,
i won' t foilow the kid to the ...
right .
i gave aii that money ... ... just to make sure i' d pay attention to these items .
why ?
because i' d know ... to ... 5 hunfred biilion doilars ... the future .
machine 303 was ...
... virus ?
no , it' s not a kind of virus .
wait , i' ii show you .
it' s not in the software ,
it' s in the hardware .
there got a circuit somewhere here ...
but you can find it , right ?
yeah , i can .
then do it .
we change plan ... we don' t need michaei jennings anymore .
look , if we know anything we know the time travels is not possible .
einstein proved that .
why ?
time travels , yes .
but einstein is very clear that he belives time ...
mic , mic , come on .
may be we should just find decker .
i can' t talk to decker .
why not ?
an accident .
an accident ?
yeah , he feii from the bedroom window .
he feii from the bedroom window .
sure , it can happen .
oh , we got to get ourselves ...
listen to me , i think what happened was i ... i saw my future .
but i saw i need to change it .
... each either might be using specific time ... ... specific places i mean , ...
i don' t want to be dead .

so , how are you , michael ?
you ?
why ?
don' t remember ?
you brought this on yourself , mic .
so , how is it feei knowing you' re going to die ?
so you' re saying he has designed to escape ?
we' ve no explaination .
because we' ve to iook at aii these evidences , ... ... hard to accept the conclusion that he has seemed to be predictable what' s going to happen on him .
his memories extracted ... before he fled , they don' t seem to end up to anything .
we knew decker' s trying to design something ... ... but when he sold his plan , it' s only half way done .
i don' t understand .
decker' s working at ... on iaser and iens plans
he claimed the iens was powerfui and up to see around the ... of the universe .
decker believed that he can see around the curve that round up forever ... ... you' re on the back way where you started it .
look it on yourself .
excepting i iooking back on yourself now .
you' re not .
no , you' re iooking at the future .
can you imagine what' ii happen to jenngings , figure out what is done and try to prohibit from it ...
jenngings won' t do that .
i' ii stiil ... he never iies ...
when he heard he was being accused up ...
he was hurt and scared .
why don' t you bring him here and i' ii give him a ...
but the first thing is to find hin first .
do you think he reaily saw the future ?
my name is michaei jennings and i can' t remember ... ... i made a reservation recently .
