grandfather' s here .
mom , can' t you tell him that i' m sick ?
you' re sick , that' s why he' s here .
he' il pinch my cheek .
i hate that .
maybe he won' t .
hey !
how' s the sickie ?
heh ?
i think i' il leave you two pals alone .
i brought you a special present .
what is it ?
open it up .
a book ? !
that' s right .
when i was your age , television was called books .
and this is a special book .
it was the book my father used to read to me when i was sick , and i used to read it to your father .
and today , i' m gonna read it to you .
has it got any sports in it ?
are you kidding ?
fencing .
fighting .
torture .
revenge .
giants .
monsters .
chases .
escapes .
true love .
miracles .
it doesn' t sound too bad .
i' il try and stay awake .
oh .
well , thank you very much .
very nice of you .
your vote of confidence is overwhelming .
all right .
the princess bride " , by s. morgenstern .
chapter one .
buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of florin .
her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there .
his name was westley , but she never called him that .
isn' t that a wonderful beginning ?
yeah .
it' s really good .
nothing gave buttercup as much pleasure as ordering westley around .
farm boy .
polish my horse' s saddle .
i want to see my face shining in it by morning .
as you wish .
as you wish " was all he ever said to her .
farm boy .
fill these with water please .
as you wish .
that day , she was amazed to discover that when he was saying , " as you wish , " what he meant was , " i love you .
and even more amazing was the day she realized she truly loved him back .
farm boy , fetch me that pitcher .
as you wish .
hold it , hold it .
what is this ?
are you trying to trick me ?
where' s the sports ?
is this a kissing book ?
wait , just wait .
when it gets good ?
keep your shirt on .
let me read .
westley had no money for marriage .
so he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea .
it was a very emotional time for buttercup .
i don' t believe this .
i fear i' il never see you again .
of course you will .
but what if something happens to you ?
i will always come for you .
but how can you be sure ?
this is true love .
you think this happens every day ?
westley didn' t reach his destination .
his ship was attacked by the dread pirate roberts , who never left captives alive .
when buttercup got the news that westley was murdered ,
murdered by pirates is good .
she went into her room and shut the door .
and for days , she neither slept nor ate .
i will never love again .
five years later , the main square of florin city was filled as never before to hear the announcement of the great prince humperdinck' s bride to be .
my people !
a month from now , our country will have its 500th anniversary .
on that sundown , i shall marry a lady who was once a commoner like yourselves , but perhaps you will not find her common now .
would you like to meet her ?
yes !
my people the princess buttercup !
buttercup' s emptiness consumed her .
although the law of the land gave humperdinck the right to choose his bride , she did not love him .
despite humperdinck' s reassurance that she would grow to love him , the only joy she found was in her daily ride .
a word , my lady ?
we are but poor , lost circus performers .
is there a village nearby ?
there is nothing nearby .
not for miles .
then there will be no one to hear you scream .
what is that you' re ripping ?
it' s fabric from the uniform of an army officer of guilder .
who' s guilder ?
the country across the sea .
the sworn enemy of florin .
go !
once the horse reaches the castle , the fabric will make the prince suspect the guilderians have abducted his love .
when he finds her body dead on the guilder frontier , his suspicions will be totally confirmed .
you never said anything about killing anyone .
i' ve hired you to help me start a war .
it' s a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition .
i just don' t think it' s right , killing an innocent girl .
am i going mad or did the word " think " escape your lips ?
you were not hired for your brains , you hippopotamic land mass .
i agree with fezzik .
oh !
the sot has spoken .
what happens to her is not truly your concern .
i will kill her .
and remember this never forget this when i found you , you were so slobbering drunk you couldn' t buy brandy .
and you friendless , brainless , helpless , hopeless ,
do you want me to send you back to where you were , unemployed in greenland ?
that vizzini , he can fuss .
fuss ... fuss ...
i think he likes to scream at us .
probably he means no harm .
he' s really very short on charm .
oh , you' ve a great gift for rhyme .
yes , some of the time .
enough of that !
fezzik , are there rocks ahead ?
if there are , we' il all be dead .
no more rhymes now , i mean it .
anybody want a peanut ?
we' il reach the cliffs by dawn .
why are you doing that ?
making sure nobody' s following us .
that would be inconceivable .
despite what you think , you will be caught .
of all the necks on this boat , highness , the one you should be worrying about is your own .
stop doing that .
we can all relax , it' s almost over .
you' re sure nobody' s following us ?
as i told you , it would be absolutely , totally , and in all other ways , inconceivable .
no one in guilder knows what we' ve done .
and no one in florin could have gotten here so fast .
out of curiosity , why do you ask ?
no reason .
it' s only , i just happened to look behind us , and something is there .
what ? !
probably some local fisherman out for a pleasure cruise at night , through eel infested waters ...
go in , get after her !
i don' t swim .
i only dog paddle .
veer left .
left .
left !
do you know what that sound is , highness ?
those are the shrieking eels .
if you doubt me , just wait .
they always grow louder when they' re about to feed on human flesh .
if you swim back now , i promise , no harm will come to you .
i doubt you will get such an offer from the eels .
she doesn' t get eaten by the eels at this time .
what ?
the eel doesn' t get her .
i' m explaining to you because you look nervous .
i wasn' t nervous .
well , maybe i was a little bit concerned .
but that' s not the same thing .
because i can stop now if you want .
no .
you could read a little bit more ... if you want .
do you know what that sound is , highness ?
those are the shrieking eels .
we' re past that , grandpa .
you read it already .
oh .
oh my goodness , i did .
i' m sorry .
beg your pardon .
all right , let' s see .
she was in the water , the eel was coming after her .
she was frightened .
the eel started to charge her .
and then
put her down .
just put her down .
i think he' s getting closer .
he' s no concern of ours .
sail on !
i suppose you think you' re brave , don' t you ?
only compared to some .
look !
he' s right on top of us .
i wonder if he is using the same wind we are using .
whoever he is , he' s too late see ?
the cliffs of insanity .
hurry up .
move the thing ... that other thing .
move it !
we' re safe .
only fezzik is strong enough to go up our way , he' il have to sail around for hours ' til he finds a harbor .
he' s climbing the rope .
and he' s gaining on us .
inconceivable !
faster !
i thought i was going faster .
you were supposed to be this colossus .
you were this great , legendary thing .
and yet he gains .
well , i' m carrying three people .
and he got only himself .
i do not accept excuses ,
i' m just going to have to find myself a new giant , that' s all .
don' t say that , vizzini .
please .
did i make it clear that your job is at stake ?
he has very good arms .
he didn' t fall ?
inconceivable !
you keep using that word .
i do not think it means what you think it means .
my god !
he' s climbing .
whoever he is , he' s obviously seen us with the princess , and must therefore die .
you , carry her .
we' il head straight for the guilder frontier .
catch up when he' s dead .
if he falls fine .
if not the sword .
i' m going to duel him left handed .
you know what a hurry we' re in !
it' s the only way i can be satisfied .
if i use my right , it' il be over too quickly .
oh , have it your way .
you be careful .
people in masks cannot be trusted .
i' m waiting !
hello there .
slow going ?
look , i don' t mean to be rude , but this is not as easy as it looks ,
so i' d appreciate it if you wouldn' t distract me .
sorry .
thank you .
i do not suppose you could speed things up ?
if you' re in such a hurry , you could lower a rope , or a tree branch , or find something useful to do .
i could do that .
in fact , i' ve got some rope up here .
but i do not think that you will accept my help , since i am only waiting around to kill you .
that does put a damper on our relationship .
but i promise i will not kill you until you reach the top .
that' s very comforting .
but i' m afraid you' il just have to wait .
i hate waiting .
i could give you my word as a spaniard .
no good .
i' ve known too many spaniards .
you don' t know any way you' il trust me ?
nothing comes to mind .
i swear on the soul of my father , domingo montoya ,
you will reach the top alive .
throw me the rope .
thank you .
we' il wait until you' re ready .
again .
thank you .
i do not mean to pry , but you don' t by any chance happen to have six fingers on your right hand ?
do you always begin conversations this way ?
my father was slaughtered by a six fingered man .
he was a great swordmaker , my father .
and when the six fingered man appeared and requested a special sword , my father took the job .
he slaved a year before he was done .
i have never seen its equal .
the six fingered man returned and demanded it , but at one tenth his promised price .
my father refused .
without a word , the six fingered man slashed him through the heart .
i loved my father , so , naturally , i challenged his murderer to a duel ...
i failed .
the six fingered man did leave me alive , but he gave me these .
how old were you ?
i was eleven years old .
when i was strong enough , i dedicated my life to the study of fencing .
so the next time we meet , i will not fail .
i will go up to the six fingered man and say ,
hello , my name is inigo montoya .
you killed my father .
prepare to die .
you' ve done nothing but study swordplay ?
more pursuit than study lately .
you see , i cannot find him .
it' s been twenty years now .
i am starting to lose confidence .
i just work for vizzini to pay the bills .
there' s not a lot of money in revenge .
well , i certainly hope you find him , someday .
you are ready , then ?
whether i am or not , you' ve been more than fair .
you seem a decent fellow .
i hate to kill you .
you seem a decent fellow .
i hate to die .
begin !
you' re using bonetti' s defense against me , ah ?
i thought it fitting , considering the rocky terrain .
naturally , you must expect me to attack with capo ferro .
naturally , but i find thibault cancels out capo ferro , don' t you ?
unless the enemy has studied his agrippa , which i have .
you are wonderful !
thank you , i' ve worked hard to become so .
i admit it , you are better than i am .
then why are you smiling ?
because i know something you don' t know .
and what is that ?
i am not left handed .
you' re amazing !
i ought to be after twenty years .
there' s something i ought to tell you .
tell me .
i am not left handed either .
who are you ? !
no one of consequence .
i must know .
get used to disappointment .
okay .
kill me quickly .
i would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself .
however , since i can' t have you following me either ...
please understand , i hold you in the highest respect .
inconceivable !
give her to me .
catch up with us quickly .
what do i do ?
finish him , finish him .
your way .
oh , good , my way .
thank you , vizzini .
which way is my way ?
pick up one of those rocks , get behind the boulder , in a few minutes , the man in black will come running around the bend .
the minute his head is in view , hit it with the rock !
my way' s not very sportsmanlike .
i did that on purpose .
i don' t have to miss .
i believe you .
so what happens now ?
sportsmanlike .
no tricks , no weapons , skill against skill alone .
you mean , you' il put down your rock and i' il put down my sword , and we' il try to kill each other like civilized people ?
i could kill you now .
frankly , i think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting .
it' s not my fault being the biggest and the strongest .
i don' t even exercise .
look , are you just fiddling around with me or what ?
i just want you to feel you' re doing well .
i hate for people to die embarrassed .
you' re quick .
and a good thing too .
why do you wear a mask ?
were you burned by acid , or something like that ?
oh no .
it' s just that they' re terribly comfortable .
i think everyone will be wearing them in the future .
i just figured out why you give me so much trouble .
why is that , do you think ?
well , i haven' t fought just one person for so long .
i' ve been specializing in groups .
battling gangs for local charities , that kind of thing .
why should that make such a difference ?
well , you see , you use different moves when you' re fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one .
i don' t envy you the headache you will have when you awake .
but , in the meantime , rest well ... and dream of large women .
there was a mighty duel .
it ranged all over .
they were both masters .
who won ?
how did it end ?
the loser ran off alone .
the winner followed those footprints toward guilder !
shall we track them both ?
the loser is nothing .
only the princess matters .
clearly this was all planned by warriors of guilder .
we must be ready for whatever lies ahead .
could this be a trap ?
i always think everything could be a trap , which is why i' m still alive .
so , it is down to you .
and it is down to me .
if you wish her dead , by all means keep moving forward .
let me explain there' s nothing to explain .
you' re trying to kidnap what i' ve rightfully stolen .
perhaps an arrangement can be reached ?
there will be no arrangement and you' re killing her !
but if there can be no arrangement , then we are at an impasse .
i' m afraid so .
i can' t compete with you physically .
and you' re no match for my brains .
you' re that smart ?
let me put it this way : have you ever heard of plato , aristotle , socrates ?
yes .
morons .
really ?
in that case , i challenge you to a battle of wits .
for the princess ?
to the death ?
i accept !
good .
then pour the wine .
inhale this , but do not touch .
i smell nothing .
what you do not smell is called iocane powder .
it is odorless , tasteless , dissolves instantly in liquid , and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man .
all right : where is the poison ?
the battle of wits has begun .
it ends when you decide and we both drink , and find out who is right and who is dead .
but it' s so simple .
all i have to do is divine from what i know of you .
are you the sort of man who would put the poison into his own goblet , or his enemy' s ?
now , a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet , because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given .
i' m not a great fool , so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you .
but you must have known i was not a great fool . you would have counted on it , so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me .
you' ve made your decision then ?
not remotely .
because iocane comes from australia , as everyone knows .
and australia is entirely peopled with criminals .
and criminals are used to having people not trust them , as you are not trusted by me .
so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you .
truly , you have a dizzying intellect .
wait till i get going !
where was i ?
australia .
yes , australia .
and you must have suspected i would have known the powder' s origin , so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me .
you' re just stalling now .
you' d like to think that , wouldn' t you ?
you' ve beaten my giant , which means you' re exceptionally strong .
so , you could have put the poison in your own goblet , trusting on your strength to save you .
so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you .
but , you' ve also bested my spaniard , which means you must have studied .
and in studying , you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible , so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me .
you' re trying to trick me into giving away something it won' t work .
it has worked you' ve given everything away i know where the poison is .
then make your choice .
i will .
and i choose ...
what in the world can that be ?
what ?
where ?
i don' t see anything .
oh , i could have sworn i saw something .
no matter .
what' s so funny ?
i' il tell you in a minute .
first , let' s drink : me from my glass , and you from yours .
you guessed wrong .
you only think i guessed wrong that' s what' s so funny !
i switched glasses when your back was turned .
you fool !
you fell victim to one of the classic blunders .
never get involved in a land war in asia .
never go in against a sicilian when death is on the line .
who are you ?
i am no one to be trifled with , that is all you ever need know .
to think , all that time it was your cup that was poisoned .
they were both poisoned .
i spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder .
someone has beaten a giant .
there will be great suffering in guilder if she dies .
catch your breath .
if you' il release me ... whatever you ask for ransom you' il get it , i promise you ...
and what is that worth , the promise of a woman ?
you' re very funny , highness .
i was giving you a chance .
no matter where you take me ... there' s no greater hunter than prince humperdinck .
he could track a falcon on a cloudy day .
he can find you .
you think your dearest love will save you ?
i never said he was my dearest love .
and yes , he will save me .
that i know .
you admit me you do not love your fiance ?
he knows i do not love him .
are not capable of love is what you mean .
i have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream .
that was a warning , highness .
the next time , my hand flies on its own .
for where i come from , there are penalties when a woman lies .
iocane .
i' d bet my life on it .
and there are the princess' s footprints .
she is alive ... or was , an hour ago .
if she is otherwise when i find her , i shall be very put out .
rest , highness .
i know who you are , your cruelty reveals everything .
you' re the dread pirate roberts .
admit it !
with pride .
what can i do for you ?
you can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces .
hardly complimentary , your highness .
why loose your venom on me ?
you killed my love .
it' s possible .
i kill a lot of people .
who was this love of yours ?
another prince , like this one , ugly , rich , and scabby ?
no .
a farm boy .
poor .
poor and perfect .
with eyes like the sea after a storm .
on the high seas , your ship attacked , and the dread pirate roberts never takes prisoners .
i can' t afford to make exceptions .
i mean once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft , people begin to disobey you , and then it' s nothing but work , work , work , all the time .
you mock my pain !
life is pain , highness .
anyone who says differently is selling something .
i remember this farm boy of yours , i think .
this would be , what , five years ago ?
does it bother you to hear ?
nothing you can say will upset me .
he died well , that should please you .
no bribe attempts or blubbering .
please .
please , i need to live .
it was the " please " that caught my memory .
i asked him what was so important for him .
true love , he replied .
and then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness .
i can only assume he meant you .
you should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are .
and what am i ?
faithfulness he talked of , madam .
your enduring faithfulness .
now , tell me truly .
when you found out he was gone , did you get engaged to your prince that same hour , or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead ?
you mocked me once , never do it again !
i died that day !
you can die too , for all i care !
as ... you ... wish ...
oh , my sweet westley !
what have i done ?
he disappeared .
he must have seen us closing in , which might account for his panicking in the error .
unless i' m wrong , and i am never wrong , they are headed dead into the fire swamp .
can you move at all ?
move ? !
you' re alive .
if you want , i can fly .
i told you , i would always come for you .
why didn' t you wait for me ?
well , you were dead .
death cannot stop true love .
all it can do is delay it for a while .
i will never doubt again .
there will never be a need .
oh no .
no , please .
what is it ?
what' s the matter ?
they' re kissing again .
do we have to hear the kissing part ?
someday , you may not mind so much ...
skip on to the fire swamp , that sounded good .
oh .
you' re sick i' il humor you .
so now , where were we here ?
yeah , yeah , yeah .
okay .
westley and buttercup raced along the ravine floor .
ha !
your pig fiance is too late .
a few more steps and we' il be safe in the fire swamp .
we' il never survive .
nonsense .
you' re only saying that because no one ever has .
it' s not that bad .
well , i' m not saying i' d like to build a summer home here , but the trees are actually quite lovely .
well now , that was an adventure .
singed a bit , were you ?
you ?
well , one thing i will say .
the fire swamp certainly does keep you on your toes .
this will all soon be but a happy memory , because roberts ' ship " revenge " is anchored at the far end
and i , as you know , am roberts .
but how is that possible ?
since he' s been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago ?
i myself am often surprised at life' s little quirks .
you see , what i told you before about saying " please " was true .
it intrigued roberts , as did my descriptions of your beauty .
finally , roberts decided something .
all right , westley , i' ve never had a valet .
you can try it for tonight .
i' il most likely kill you in the morning .
good night , westley .
good work .
sleep well .
i' il most likely kill you in the morning .
it was a fine time for me .
i was learning to fence , to fight , anything anyone would teach me .
and roberts and i eventually became friends .
and then it happened .
what ?
go on .
roberts had grown so rich , he wanted to retire .
so he took me to his cabin and told me his secret .
i am not the dread pirate roberts " , he said , " my name is ryan .
i inherited this ship from the previous dread pirate roberts " ,
just as you will inherit it from me .
the man i inherited it from was not the real dread pirate roberts , either .
his name was cummerbund .
the real roberts has been retired fifteen years
and living like a king in patagonia .
then he explained the name was the important thing for inspiring the necessary fear .
you see , no one would surrender to the dread pirate westley .
so we sailed ashore , took on an entirely new crew and he stayed aboard for awhile as first mate , all the time calling me roberts .
once the crew believed , he left the ship and i have been roberts ever since .
except , now that we' re together , i shall retire and hand the name over to someone else .
is everything clear to you ?
we' il never succeed , we may as well die here .
no , no .
we have already succeeded .
i mean , what are the three terrors of the fire swamp ?
one : the flame spurts .
no problem .
there' s a popping sound preceding each , we can avoid that .
two : the lightning sand .
but you were clever enough to discover what that looks like , so in the future we can avoid that too .
westley , what about the r. o. u. s. ' s ?
rodents of unusual size ?
i don' t think they exist ...
westley !
we did it .
now , was that so terrible ?
surrender !
you mean you wish to surrender to me ?
very well , i accept .
i give you full marks for bravery , don' t make yourself a fool .
ah , but how will you capture us ?
we know the secrets of the fire swamp .
we can live there quite happily for some time , so , whenever you feel like dying , feel free to visit .
i tell you once again : surrender !
it will not happen !
for the last time : surrender !
death first !
will you promise not to hurt him ?
what was that ?
what was that ?
if we surrender , and i return with you , will you promise not to hurt this man ?
may i live a thousand years and never hunt again .
he is a sailor on the pirate ship " revenge .
promise to return him to his ship .
i swear it will be done .
once we' re out of sight , take him back to florin and throw him in the pit of despair .
i swear it will be done .
i thought you were dead once , and it almost destroyed me .
i could not bear it if you died again , not when i could save you .
come , sir .
we must get you to your ship .
we are men of action .
lies do not become us .
well spoken , sir
what is it ?
you have six fingers on your right hand , someone was looking for you ...
where am i ?
the pit of despair .
don' t even think ...
don' t even think about trying to escape .
the chains are far too thick .
and don' t dream of being rescued either .
the only way in is secret .
and only the prince , the count and i know how to get in and out .
then i' m here till i die ?
till they kill you , yeah .
then why bother curing me ?
the prince and the count always insist on everyone being healthy before they' re broken .
so it' s to be torture .
i can cope with torture .
you don' t believe me ?
you survived the fire swamp .
you must be very brave ... but nobody withstands ... the machine .
she' s been like that ever since the fire swamp .
it' s my father' s failing health that' s upsetting her .
of course .
the king died that very night , and before the following dawn , buttercup and humperdinck were married .
and at noon , she met her subjects again .
this time as their queen .
my father' s final words were ...
hold it .
hold it , grandpa .
you read that wrong .
she doesn' t marry humperdinck , she marries westley .
i' m just sure of it .
after all that westley did for her , if she does not marry him , it wouldn' t be fair .
well , who says life is fair ?
where is that written ?
life isn' t always fair .
i' m telling you you' re messing up the story , now get it right !
do you want me to go on with this ?
yes .
all right , then .
no more interruptions .
at noon , she met her subjects again .
this time as their queen .
love her as i loved her , and there will be joy .
queen buttercup .
why do you do this ?
because you had love in your hands , and you gave it up .
but they would have killed westley if i hadn' t done it .
your true love lives and you marry another .
true love saved her in the fire swamp , and she treated it like garbage .
and that' s what she is , the queen of refuse !
so , bow down to her if you want .
bow to her .
bow to the queen of slime , the queen of filth , the queen of putrescence .
boo !
boo !
rubbish !
filth !
slime !
muck !
boo !
boo !
it was ten days till the wedding .
the king still lived , but buttercup' s nightmares were growing steadily worse .
see ?
didn' t i tell you she' d never marry that rotten humperdinck ?
yes , you' re very smart .
shut up .
i love westley .
i always have .
i know now i always will .
if you tell me i must marry you in ten days , please believe i will be dead by morning .
i could never cause you grief .
consider our wedding off .
you returned this westley to his ship ?
yes .
then we will simply alert him .
beloved , are you certain he still wants you ?
after all , it was you who did the leaving in the fire swamp .
not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words .
my westley will always come for me .
i suggest a deal .
you write four copies of a letter .
i' il send my four fastest ships .
one in each direction .
the dread pirate roberts is always close to florin this time of year .
we' il run up the white flag and deliver your message .
if westley wants you , bless you both .
if not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide .
are we agreed ?
your princess is really a winning creature .
a trifle simple , perhaps , but her appeal is undeniable .
oh , i know .
the people are quite taken with her .
it' s odd , but when i hired vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day ,
i thought that was clever .
but it' s going to be so much more moving when i strangle her on our wedding night .
once guilder is blamed , the nation will be truly outraged .
they' il demand we go to war .
now , where is that secret knot ?
it' s impossible to find .
are you coming down into the pit ?
westley' s got his strength back .
i am starting him on the machine tonight .
tyrone , you know how much i love watching you work , but i' ve got my country' s 500th anniversary to plan , my wedding to arrange , my wife to murder , and guilder to frame for it .
i' m swamped .
get some rest , if you haven' t got your health , you haven' t got anything .
beautiful , isn' t it ?
it took me half a lifetime to invent it .
i' m sure you' ve discovered my deep and abiding interest in pain .
at present i' m writing the definitive work on the subject .
so i want you to be totally honest with me on how the machine makes you feel .
this being our first try , i' il use the lowest setting .
as you know , the concept of the suction pump is centuries old .
well , really , that' s all this is .
except that instead of sucking water , i' m sucking life .
i' ve just sucked one year of your life away .
i might one day go as high as five , but i really don' t know what that would do to you .
so , let' s just start with what we have .
what did this do to you ?
tell me .
and remember , this is for posterity , so be honest , how do you feel ?
interesting .
yellin .
sire .
as chief enforcer of all florin , i trust you with this secret : killers from guilder are infiltrating the thieves ' forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night .
my spy network has heard no such news .
any word from westley ?
too soon , my angel .
patience .
he will come for me .
of course .
she will not be murdered .
on the day of the wedding , i want the thieves ' forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested .
many of the thieves will resist .
my regular enforcers will be inadequate .
form a brute squad then .
i want the thieves ' forest emptied before i wed .
it won' t be easy , sire .
try ruling the world sometime .
the day of the wedding arrived .
the brute squad had their hands full carrying out humperdinck' s orders .
is everybody out ?
almost .
there' s a spaniard giving us some trouble .
well , you give him some trouble .
move !
i am waiting for you , vizzini .
you told me to go back to the beginning .
so i have .
this is where i am , and this is where i' il stay .
i will not be moved .
ho there .
i do not budge .
keep your " ho there .
but the prince gave orders .
so did vizzini .
when a job went wrong , you went back to the beginning .
and this is where we got the job .
so it' s the beginning , and i' m staying till vizzini comes .
you !
brute !
come here .
i am waiting for vizzini .
you surely are a meanie .
hello .
it' s you .
true !
you don' t look so good .
you don' t smell so good either .
perhaps not .
i feel fine .
fezzik and inigo were reunited .
and as fezzik nursed his inebriated friend back to health , he told inigo of vizzini' s death and the existence of count rugen , the six fingered man .
considering inigo' s lifelong search , he handled the news surprisingly well .
fezzik took great care in reviving inigo .
that' s enough .
that' s enough !
where is this rugen so i may kill him ?
he' s with the prince in the castle .
but the castle gate is guarded by thirty men .
how many could you handle ?
i don' t think more than ten .
leaveing twenty for me .
at my best , i could never defeat that many .
i need vizzini to plan .
i have no gift for strategy .
but vizzini' s dead .
no , not vizzini .
i need the man in black .
what ?
look , he bested you with strength , your greatness .
he bested me with steel .
he must have out thought vizzini , and a man who can do that can plan my castle' s onslaught any day .
let' s go .
where ?
to find the man in black , obviously .
but you don' t know where he is .
don' t bother me with trifles , after twenty years , at last , my father' s soul will be at peace .
there will be blood tonight !
rise and report .
the thieves ' forest is emptied .
thirty men guard the castle gate .
double it .
my princess must be safe .
the gate has but one key and i carry that .
ah !
my dulcet darling .
tonight we marry .
tomorrow morning , your men will escort us to florin channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon .
every ship but your four fastest , you mean .
every ship but the four you sent .
yes .
yes , of course .
naturally , not those four .
your majesties .
you never sent the ships .
don' t bother lying .
it doesn' t matter .
westley will come for me anyway .
you' re a silly girl .
yes , i am a silly girl , for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear .
i would not say such things if i were you .
why not ?
you can' t hurt me .
westley and i are joined by the bonds of love .
and you cannot track that .
not with a thousand bloodhounds .
and you cannot break it .
not with a thousand swords .
and when i say you are a coward , that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth .
i would not say such things if i were you !
you truly love each other and so you might have been truly happy .
not one couple in a century has that chance , no matter what the storybooks say .
and so i think no man in a century will suffer as greatly as you will .
not to fifty !
fezzik , fezzik , listen , do you hear ?
that is the sound of ultimate suffering .
my heart made that sound when rugen slaughtered my father .
the man in black makes it now .
the man in black ?
his true love is marrying another tonight , so who else has cause for ultimate suffering ?
excuse me , pardon me , it' s important .
fezzik , please .
everybody ... move !
thank you .
where is the man in black ?
you get there from this grove , yes ?
fezzik , jog his memory .
i' m sorry , inigo .
i didn' t mean to jog him so hard .
inigo ?
father , i have failed you for twenty years .
now our misery can end .
somewhere ... somewhere close by is a man who can help us .
i cannot find him alone .
i need you .
i need you to guide my sword .
please .
guide my sword .
he' s dead .
it just is not fair .
grandpa , grandpa .
wait , wait .
what did fezzik mean , " he' s dead ?
i mean , he didn' t mean " dead " ...
westley' s only faking , right ?
you want me to read this or not ?
who gets humperdinck ?
i don' t understand .
who kills prince humperdinck ?
at the end , somebody' s got to do it .
is it inigo ?
who ?
nobody .
nobody kills him .
he lives .
you mean he wins ?
jesus , grandpa !
what did you read me this thing for ?
you know , you' ve been very sick and you' re taking this story very seriously .
i think we better stop now .
no !
i' m okay .
i' m okay .
sit down .
all right ?
okay , all right , now , let' s see .
where were we ?
oh yes .
in the pit of despair .
well , we montoyas have never taken defeat easily .
come along , fezzik , bring the body .
the body ?
have you any money ?
i have a little .
i just hope your savings are enough to buy us a miracle thats all
go away !
are you the miracle max who worked for the king all those years ?
the king' s stinking son fired me .
and thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject .
while you' re at it , why don' t you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it ?
we' re closed !
beat it or i' il call the brute squad .
i' m on the brute squad .
you are the brute squad .
we need a miracle , it' s very important .
look , i' m retired .
besides , why would you want someone the king' s stinking son fired ?
i might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle .
he' s already dead .
he is , eh ?
i' il take a look .
bring him in .
i' ve seen worse .
sir , sir !
we' re really in a terrible rush .
don' t rush me , sonny .
you rush a miracle man , you get rotten miracles .
you got money ?
65 .
i never worked for so little , except once , and that was a very noble cause .
this is noble , sir .
his wife is crippled , his children are on the brink of starvation .
are you a rotten liar .
i need him to help avenge my father , murdered these twenty years .
your first story was better .
where' s that bellows ?
he probably owes you money , huh ?
well , i' il ask him .
he' s dead .
he can' t talk .
look who knows so much .
well , it just so happens that your friend here is only " mostly dead " .
there' s a big difference between " mostly dead " and " all dead " .
please open his mouth .
now , mostly dead is slightly alive .
now , all dead ... well , with all dead , there' s usually only one thing that you can do .
what' s that ?
go through his clothes and look for loose change .
hey !
hello in there .
hey !
what' s so important ?
what you got here that' s worth living for ?
true ... love ...
true love .
you heard him .
you could not ask for a more noble cause than that .
sonny , true love is the greatest thing in the world .
except for a nice mlt , a mutton , lettuce and tomato sandwich , where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe .
they' re so perky , i love that .
but that' s not what he said .
he distinctly said " to blave " .
and , as we all know , " to blave " means " to bluff " .
so you' re probably playing cards , and he cheated ...
liar !
liar !
get back , witch !
i' m not a witch , i' m your wife .
but after what you just said , i' m not even sure i want to be that anymore .
you never had it so good .
true love " , he said .
true love , max .
my god !
don' t say another word , valerie .
he' s afraid .
ever since prince humperdinck fired him , his confidence is shattered .
why' d you say that name ?
you promised me that you would never say that name .
what , humperdinck ?
humperdinck .
humperdinck !
humperdinck .
humperdinck .
i' m not listening .
a life expiring and you don' t have the decency to say why you won' t help .
nobody' s hearing nothing !
humperdinck !
humperdinck !
this is buttercup' s true love .
if you heal him , he will stop humperdinck' s wedding .
shut up !
wait .
i make him better , humperdinck suffers ?
humiliations galore !
that is a noble cause .
give me the sixty five , i' m on the job .
that' s a miracle pill ?
the chocolate coating makes it go down easier .
but you have to wait 15 minutes for full potency .
and you shouldn' t go swimming after , for at least , what ?
an hour .
yeah , an hour .
a good hour .
thank you for everything .
okay .
bye bye , boys .
have fun storming the castle .
think it' il work ?
it would take a miracle .
bye !
bye !
inigo , there' s more than thirty ...
what' s the difference ?
we' ve got him .
help me here .
we' il have to force feed him .
has it been fifteen minutes ?
we can' t wait the wedding' s in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand .
tilt his head back .
open his mouth .
how long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works ?
your guess is as good as mine ...
i' il beat you both apart .
i' il take you both together ! ... i guess not very long .
why won' t my arms move ?
you' ve been mostly dead all day .
we had miracle max make a pill to bring you back .
who are you ?
are we enemies ?
why am i on this wall ?
where' s buttercup ?
let me explain ...
no , there is too much .
let me sum up .
buttercup is marrying humperdinck in a little less than half an hour ,
so all we have to do is get in , break up the wedding , steal the princess , make our escape .
after i kill count rugen .
that doesn' t leave much time for dilly dallying .
you' ve just wiggled your finger .
that' s wonderful .
i' ve always been a quick healer .
what are our liabilities ?
there is but one working castle gate ...
... and it is guarded by sixty men .
and our assets ?
your brains , fezzik' s strength , my steel .
that' s it ?
impossible .
if i had a month to plan , maybe i could come up with something .
but this ...
you just shook your head that doesn' t make you happy ?
my brains , his steel , and your strength against sixty men , and you think a little head jiggle is supposed to make me happy ?
i mean , if we only had a wheelbarrow , that would be something .
where did we put that wheelbarrow the albino had ?
over the albino , i think .
well , why didn' t you list that among our assets in the first place ?
what i wouldn' t give for a holocaust cloak .
there we cannot help you .
will this do ?
where did you get that ?
at miracle max' s .
it fit so nice , he said i could keep it .
all right , all right .
come on , help me up .
now , i' il need a sword eventually .
why ?
you can' t even lift one .
true , but that' s hardly common knowledge , is it ?
thank you .
now , there may be problems once we' re inside .
i' il say !
how do i find the count ?
once i do , how do i find you again ?
once i find you again , how do we escape ?
don' t pester him , he' s had a hard day .
right , right , sorry .
inigo .
what ?
i hope we win ...
you don' t seem excited , my little muffin .
should i be ?
brides often are , i' m told .
i do not marry tonight .
my westley will save me .
marriage .
marriage is what brings us together today .
marriage , that blessed arrangement , that dream within a dream ...
stand your ground , men !
stand your ground !
i am the dread pirate roberts !
there will be no survivors .
now ?
not yet .
my men are here , and i am here , but soon you will not be here .
now ?
light him .
the dread pirate roberts takes no survivors .
all your worst nightmares are about to come true .
and love , true love , will follow you forever ...
the dread pirate roberts is here for your souls !
stay where you are .
i said stay where you are !
so treasure your love ...
skip to the end .
have you the ring ?
here comes my westley now .
fezzik , the portcullis .
your westley is dead .
i killed him myself .
then why is there fear behind your eyes ?
give us the gate key .
i have no gate key .
fezzik , tear his arms off .
oh , you mean this gate key .
and do you , princess buttercup ...
man and wife " , say " man and wife " !
man and wife .
escort the bride to the honeymoon suite , i' il be there shortly .
he didn' t come .
kill the dark one and the giant , but leave the third for questioning .
hello .
my name is inigo montoya .
you killed my father .
prepare to die .
fezzik !
i need you !
i can' t leave him alone .
he' s getting away from me !
fezzik .
please !
i' il be right back .
thank you
strange wedding .
yes .
a very strange wedding .
come along .
what was that for ?
because you' ve always been so kind to me .
and i won' t be seeing you again since i' m killing myself once we reach the honeymoon suite .
won' t that be nice ?
she kissed me !
sorry , father .
i tried .
i tried ...
you must be that little spanish brat i taught a lesson to all those years ago .
it' s simply incredible .
have you been chasing me your whole life only to fail now ?
i think that' s the worst thing i ever heard .
how marvelous .
there' s a shortage of perfect breasts in this world .
it would be a pity to damage yours .
oh , westley , darling !
westley , why won' t you hold me ?
gently .
at a time like this that' s all you can think to say ?
gently " ?
gently !
good heavens .
are you still trying to win ?
you' ve got an overdeveloped sense of vengeance .
it' s going to get you into trouble some day .
hello .
my name is inigo montoya .
you killed my father .
prepare to die .
hello .
my name is inigo montoya .
you killed my father .
prepare to die .
hello .
my name is inigo montoya .
you killed my father .
prepare to die .
stop saying that !
hello .
my name is inigo montoya .
you killed my father !
prepare to die !
power too , promise me that .
all that i have and more .
please ...
offer me everything i ask for .
anything you want .
i want my father back , you son of a bitch !
oh , westley , will you ever forgive me ?
what hideous sin have you committed lately ?
i got married .
i didn' t want to .
it all happened so fast .
it never happened .
what ?
it never happened .
but it did .
i was there .
this old man said , " man and wife .
did you say , " i do " ?
well , no , we sort of skipped that part .
then you' re not married .
if you didn' t say it , you didn' t do it
wouldn' t you agree , your highness ?
a technicality that will shortly be remedied .
but first things first ...
to the death !
no .
to the pain !
i don' t think i' m quite familiar with that phrase .
i' il explain .
and i' il use small words so that you' il be sure to understand , you wart hog faced buffoon .
that may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me .
it won' t be the last .
to the pain means the first thing you lose will be your feet , below the ankles , then your hands at the wrists , next your nose . and then my tongue , i suppose .
i killed you too quickly the last time , a mistake i don' t mean to duplicate tonight .
i wasn' t finished !
the next thing you lose will be your left eye , followed by your right ... and then my ears , i understand .
let' s get on with it
wrong !
dear god , what is that thing ? " , will echo in your perfect ears .
that is what " to the pain " means .
it means i leave you in anguish , wallowing in freakish misery forever .
i think you' re bluffing .
it' s possible , pig , i might be bluffing .
it' s conceivable , you miserable vomitous mass , that i' m only lying here because i lack the strength to stand , then again , perhaps i have the strength after all .
drop your sword !
have a seat !
tie him up .
make it as tight as you like .
where' s fezzik ?
i thought he was with you .
no .
in that case ...
help him .
why does westley need helping ?
because he has no strength .
i knew it !
i knew you were bluffing !
i knew he was bluffing .
shall i dispatch him for you ?
thank you , but no .
whatever happens to us ,
i want him to live a long life alone with his cowardice .
inigo !
inigo , where are you ?
ah , there you are .
inigo , i saw the prince' s stables , and there they were , four white horses .
and i thought , there are four of us , if we ever find the lady
hello , lady ! so i took them with me , in case we ever bumped into each other .
i guess we just did .
fezzik , you did something right .
don' t worry .
i won' t let it go to my head .
you know , it' s very strange ,
i have been in the revenge business so long , now that it' s over , i don' t know what to do with the rest of my life .
have you ever considered piracy ?
you' d make a wonderful dread pirate roberts .
they rode to freedom .
and as dawn arose , westley and buttercup knew they were safe .
a wave of love swept over them .
and as they reached for each other ...
what ?
what ?
no , it' s kissing again .
you don' t want to hear it .
i don' t mind so much ...
okay .
since the invention of the kiss , there have been 5 kisses that were rated the most passionate , the most pure .
this one left them all behind .
the end .
now i think you ought to go to sleep .
okay .
okay .
okay .
all right .
shalom !
grandpa ?
maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow .
as you wish ...
