the flight of the bumblebee " performed by harry james )
once upon a time , many years ago , ... .. two burglars broke into our neighbours ' house in rockaway .
mr and mrs needleman had gone to a movie .
the following events occurred .
you think we should answer the phone ?
are you crazy ?
you wanna wake up the whole neighbourhood ?
hello ?
you , mr marty needleman , have been chosen from the telephone book to ... .. guess that tune !
jesus .
can you tell us what is the tune the orchestra is playing ?
i can' t hear it .
find the radio and turn it on !
what' s goin ' on ?
shh .
i can' t hear .
what are you doin ' ?
i think i know it .

" dancing in the dark " .

and now for question two on the way to the grand jackpot .
here' s the tune .
?
are you all mine ...

" chinatown , my chinatown " .
that' s correct !
and now the chance for the grand jackpot with all the prizes !
this one is not so easy , so get ready .
( ?
the sailor' s hornpipe " )
it sounds familiar .
i don' t ...
i know that one .
i know it from my father .

" the sailor' s hornpipe " .
the sailor' s hornpipe " ?
that' s right !
mr marty needleman , you' ve won the grand jackpot !
i' m rich !
ah ha ha ha !
we won !
the needlemans returned home and were shocked to find a ransacked apartment ... .. with $50 and silverware missing .
but the following morning a truck arrived .
( ?
the sailor' s hornpipe " )
?
let' s all sing like the birdies sing ?
tweet , tweet tweet , tweet tweet ...
now i love old radio stories , and i know a million of ' em .
l' ve collected ' em down the years , like a hobby .
anecdotes and gossip , and inside stories about the stars .
l recall so many personal experiences from when i grew up ... .. and listened to one show after another .
this girl singing used to be a favourite at my house one of many .
now it' s all gone .
except for the memories .
the scene is rockaway .
the time is my childhood .
lt' s my old neighbourhood , and forgive me if i tend to romanticise the past .
l mean , it wasn' t always as stormy and rain swept as this .
but i remember it that way because that was it at its most beautiful .
ln those days the radio was constantly playing at our house .
my mother , for instance , never missed her favourite show , ... ..
breakfast with lrene and roger " .
good morning , darling .
pass the orange juice .
there you go .
quite an opening night we attended last night , wasn' t it ?
yes , wasn' t it divine ?
everyone was there , from rodgers and hart to cole porter .
two completely different worlds .
while my mother stood over the dirty plates , ... .. lrene and roger ate an elegant breakfast in their chic manhattan town house ... .. while they chatted charmingly about people and places we only dreamt of .
tomorrow morning we' il tell you all about it , ... .. and also about the new moss hart play , which i hear is just divine .
this is lrene draper ...
.. and roger daly , saying ... .. have us for breakfast tomorrow and every morning ... .. and have a wonderful day .
my own personal favourite show was called " the masked avenger " , ... .. who i fantasised was a cross between superman and cary grant .
little did i know .
it' s the masked avenger !
it' s off to jail for you .
i hope you' il enjoy making licence plates .
l' d like to tell you about the masked avenger secret compartment ring , ... .. and how it turned me to crime .
but first you have to meet me .
and my family .
there i am in my masked avenger hat and goggles , ... .. which i got off my friend in a trade .
then there were my father and mother , ... .. two people who could find an argument in any subject .
wait , you think the atlantic is a greater ocean than the pacific ? !
no .
have it your way .
the pacific is greater .
l mean , how many people fight over oceans ?
then there was my uncle abe .
he got fish from his friends at sheepshead bay .
ceil , i' m home !
ceil , i got fish .
i got great fish today .
what do we need more fish for ?
and my aunt ceil , ... .. who dreamed of a more exciting life than having to fillet his flounder .
they' re fresh fish !
he has friends at oscar' s dock , ... .. so he can' t spend one day there where they don' t load him up with fish !
you don' t like it , take the gas pipe !
next there was grandpa and grandma .
every morning he spent a half hour packing her into her corset .
i' m pulling , i' m pulling !
a woman in her seventies , and her bosom is still growing !
abe and ceil' s daughter was cousin ruthie , ... .. who entertained herself by listening to the neighbours on the party line .
mrs waldbaum' s having her ovaries out !
both , or one ?
get off the line , ok ?
stop listening in on my phone !
stop snooping on us !
all right , all right !
don' t get your bowels in an uproar !
nobody' s snooping .
oh , yeah ?
my wife hears her breathing .
and she giggles !
hey , waldbaum !
you think we care what goes on in your house ?
let them take her ovaries out !
what' s it our business ?
mrs waldbaum had a steel plate in her head .
lt was said she couldn' t walk near magnets .
finally , there was aunt bea , who only wanted to get married .
this is a lindy .
my dancing teacher gave me this great new step for it .
hey , tess ?
tess , i can' t decide if i should take my vacation ... .. on a cruise or go to the mountains .
i mean , the men are richer on a cruise , but there' s more of them in the resorts .
well , i met my husband at a mountain resort , so i advise you to go on a cruise .
that' s very funny .
can we get back to my idea ?
we buy cultured pearls .
we box ' em here in velvet , and we sell them mail order .
you were in jewellery .
it didn' t work .
we got stuck with the rhinestone earrings .
you don' t have a business head .
we got stuck with mail order parts , ... .. you tried seeds , then you lost money selling greeting cards ...
we have 6, 000 " get well " cards in the closet !
there aren' t 6, 000 sick people in america !
forget it .
i' il spend the rest of my life at the job i do .
what do you do , dad ?
none of your business .
all my friends know what their dads do .
don' t you have homework ?
got 1 5 cents for a masked avenger ring ?
what am i , made of money ?
pay attention to your school work , not the radio !
you always listen to the radio .
it' s different .
our lives are ruined already .
you still have a chance to be somebody .
think i want you doin ' the job i do ?
i don' t know what your job is .
you gotta get an education .
while i' m getting it , can i get the ring ?
we don' t have money to waste .
you think we all like living together ?
we' d like to save up , maybe have another child .
your father works like a horse supporting everybody ...
at what ?
he' s a big butter and egg man .
what do you mean , our lives are ruined ?
i didn' t mean ruined ruined .
we' re poor but happy .
but definitely poor .
lsn' t this a beautiful sea bass ?
who wants to join me , hm ?
by now you' ve probably guessed that the masked avenger ring meant a lot to me .
well , it did .
because they were gold and mysterious , and they fit any finger .
the box top i already had , but the 1 5 cents was hard to come by in those days .
l tried not thinking about it , but it was very hard to keep off my mind . .. and the masts and the sail .
you even have to work with the tweezers to get some of the small stuff in .
i' il pass it around .
that was lovely , evelyn .
arnold , why don' t you show the class what you have ?
stand right over there .
i found this on my parents ' night table .
that will be enough !
sit down !
put that thing in your pocket and sit down !
ross , you have something suitable to show the class , don' t you ?
very good .
stand right here .
this is my masked avenger secret compartment ring .
it' s very special to me ...
now , basically i was an honest kid .
but there are some things in life that are just too compelling .
that afternoon at hebrew school , a scheme occurred to me .
next week , we are going to issue collection boxes .
and each of you will be asked to go out in the street ... .. and collect funds for the promotion of a new state in palestine .
can you give to the jewish national fund to help us build a homeland in palestine ?
how about you ?
can you give to the jewish national fund ?
can you ...
no ?
hey , can you ...
excuse me , can you ...
give it to me .
please .
thank you .
guys , we got enough to get the masked avenger rings and an ice cream soda .
we gotta leave some for palestine .
why ?
it' s all the way over in egypt .
it' s a sin .
what if the rabbi catches us ?
he won' t .
besides , i can handle him .
you sure ?
positive .
dimes !
i got four dimes !
monies for a jewish homeland used to buy this masked avenger ring ? !
my heart is full of grief .
it swells with anguish !
he' il pay back every cent .
yep .
shut up .
i don' t know what to do , rabbi .
every night he listens to the radio .
i say " go to the beach , play in the sun , get some fresh air .
no .
the lone ranger , the shadow , the masked avenger ...
this is no good .
this boy needs discipline .
radio ...
tsk tsk ...
it' s all right once in a while .
otherwise it tends to induce bad values , false dreams , lazy habits .
listening to these stories of foolishness and violence , ... .. this is no way for a boy to grow up .
you speak the truth , my faithful lndian companion .
to a rabbi you say " my faithful lndian companion " ? !
hey , don' t hit my son .
what kind of upbringing is this ? !
look , i' il hit him , but you don' t hit him !
i said i' il hit him !
you leave him alone !
no , i' il hit him !
you' re too lenient !
oh , i' m lenient ?
what , that' s lenient ?
i am a faithful lndian ?
such an impertinence !
rabbi , i will teach him some manners .
you and that radio !
think that' s lenient ? !
enough , enough .
you' il hurt the boy .
and so that ended my career in crime .
and i never did get the masked avenger ring .
but to this day i still get chills when i recall his famous sign off .
beware , evildoers , wherever you are !
tess , did you see my yellow bag ?
i didn' t touch it .
ooh , what is that ?
turn it up .
what' s the fuss ?
mr manulis finally asked her out .
what' d he do , go blind ?
him with the insults , right ?
hey !
tell her she looks nice .
i' il tell her , i' il tell her .
mrs waldbaum found a pocketbook ... .. and she doesn' t think she' s gonna give it back .
tess , can i borrow your anchor pin ?
sure , sure .
oh , god , he' s so handsome !
i waited so long !
i never thought he' d ask me !
where' d you meet ?
ln the catskills .
he rides horseback , he dances , he' s some tennis player !
sounds a perfect victim .
what' s he do ?
his firm imports coffee .
what do you do , dad ?
hey , get my cigarettes .
this could be the answer to my prayers .
lsn' t it time you compromised ?
i don' t know the meaning of that word .
so stay single .
can you smell my perfume ?
oh , gosh .
oh , gosh .
ok ...
ceil , get it .
i don' t want to appear too anxious .
i' ve been cleaning fish all afternoon .
i' il get it .
oh , my gosh , my glasses .
almost forgot my glasses .
oh , well , hello !
come on in .
would you come in , please ?
i' m bea' s sister , tess .
how do you do ? ls bea ready ?
oh , she' il only be a minute .
this is , uh , most of my family .
oh , hello .
and this is my husband .
oh , pleased , pleased !
that' s , uh , a firm handshake you got .
well , sure .
i hate when somebody shakes your hand , they put a dead paw in it .
sidney .
ahh !
have you been waiting long ?
oh , not at all , sugar .
well , have a nice time .
yeah , come on , sugar .
lnto the old jalopy .
we' re gonna paint the town red !
aw , gosh , didn' t bea look lovely ?
did she fall into a vat of perfume ?
when we were young , of the three sisters , she was considered the pretty one .
some contest .
oh , what do you know ?
you' re lucky i love you , you old douche bag .
aunt bea and mr manulis were having a wonderful time .
he took her out to coney lsland , where they went roller skating .
although she had never roller skated in her life , ... .. in his capable hands , she did her best .
he took her for oysters and beer .
as she later told the story , she was shy about having to wear glasses , ... .. and kept trying to hide the fact that she needed them .
aunt bea was really developing a crush on mr manulis .
as they ate and joked , it would have been impossible to guess ... .. that their evening together would soon end in total disaster .
oh , did i have a wonderful time !
i' m still a little tipsy from that beer .
oh , really ?
cos you only had one .
i know , but alcohol affects me strongly .
and you , how can you even drive ?
you must have had five beers !
oh , i' m a big boy .
i could have ten !
oh , and it' s so foggy .
yeah .
i love the fog .
it' s very romantic .
what' s that ?
you won' t believe this , but we' re out of gas .
oh , gosh .
wouldn' t you know it ?
right out here on the tip of breezy point , too .
looks like we' re stuck here .
at least till the fog lifts .
oh , well , what' s a girl to do ?
oh , sidney !
sidney , this is our first date together .
aw , bea , you know how i feel about ya .
we interrupt with a special news bulletin .
a state of emergency has been declared by the president of the us .
we go live to wilson' s glen , new jersey , ... .. where the landing of hundreds of spacecraft ... .. has now been officially confirmed as a full scale invasion by martians .
people are dying and being trampled in their efforts to escape .
the power lines are down everywhere .
we could be cut off at any minute .
oh , my gosh !
there' s another group of spaceships , of alien ships , coming out of the sky ... despite his bravado , ... .. mr manulis panicked and bolted out of the car .
he was so frightened by the reports of interplanetary invasion that he ran off , ... .. leaving aunt bea to contend with the green monsters ... .. he expected to drop from the sky at any moment .
she walked home .
six miles .
when mr manulis called for a date the next week , ... .. she told my mother to say she couldn' t see him .
she had married a martian .
now earlier , i promised some inside stories about the stars .
here' s a little something that actually happened one night with roger and lrene .
everyone' s here tonight , sweetheart .
lsn' t that richard ?
oh , richard ?
we saw that show at the morosco .
you' re right , it' s terrific .
thank you .
i thought i saw ernest hemingway at the bar .
well , i heard he was in town , angel , yes .
cigars ?
cigarettes ?
i' il have some camels .
oh , hello , mr daly .
where have you been ? !
i can never get hold of you .
i told you it was over .
please don' t say that !
listen , you call me all hours !
i meet ...
i meet you in hotel rooms , in the back of cars , in stalled elevators ...
you' re gonna lose your respect for me .
please , don' t be unreasonable .
cigars ?
cigarettes ?
cigar , please .
thank you very much .
sally , you can' t break it off now .
i' m in love with you .
yeah . lf you loved me , you' d leave your wife and marry me .
i can' t .
our ratings are too high .
hi , roger .
lucky strikes , please .
tico , tico !
brrrrrrrr !
i look at you and i' m aflame with longing .
oh , what am i gonna do ?
i' m a single girl .
i want you , sally .
i ...
i crave you .
i spoke to the head of the agency about you .
he wants to meet you .
really ?
i told him you were the most promising young actress i' d seen in years .
but you' ve never even seen me act .
i' ve got great intuition .
i care so much about you .
i' ve just got to have you , sally .
i' m ...
i' m exploding with desire .
well , i ...
we can' t do it now .
i' m working my shift .
there must be somewhere we can be alone for a few minutes .
i' d be takin ' a real chance .
i told my wife i was going to have a drink with richard rodgers .
you know , we always table hop for a long time .
let me think .
so , as the story goes , roger and sally set out to find a secluded trysting place , ... .. while roger' s wife lrene spent her time drinking and hobnobbing ... .. with society' s most interesting and exotic latin playboy .
i ...
i think it' s probably pretty safe up here .
?
and under the stars ?
an orchestra' s playing ...
listen , i only got a ten minute break .
come here , baby .
he wants to meet me ?
who ?
the head of the agency .
yeah , yeah , definitely .
yeah .
oh , wait ...
can you take this off ?
yeah , sure .
you tell him i could sing ?
sure .
like a ... like a nightingale .
you told him that ?
yeah .
promise ?
oh , yeah !
yeah !
boy , that was fast !
it probably helped i had the hiccups .
i' ve got to get back to the table .
sally , this door' s locked .
it is ?
it' s locked from the inside !
oh , no ...
what are we gonna do ?
the trick is not to panic .
there' s no other way down !
well , we' il have to climb down .
i can' t climb down the building !
what do you think i am ? !
didn' t you know it locks from the inside ?
no !
i never actually came up here with anybody but you .
oh , my god !
what a predicament !
and that' s exactly how it happened .
no matter how hard they tried , roger and sally could not get back in .
legend has it an electrical storm broke out , ... .. and that he was struck by lightning and had to miss his show for a month .
another version of the story i heard said that lrene came up to the roof ... .. with the same intention as her husband , and that sally got fired .
the other three were so sophisticated ... .. they all spent the weekend in the same hotel suite in havana .
it' s terrible .
they have no respect !
they should be thrown out .
it' s a disgrace !
my nerves are on edge from hunger .
you think they fast ?
they don' t care about the high holidays .
grandma can' t stand the radio next door .
oh , it' s awful !
it' s just awful !
wait , i don' t understand .
i thought you' re allowed to turn it on .
no .
for 24 hours you' re supposed to do nothing .
not even turn on a light switch .
just sit and fast and pray and atone for your sins .
well , how come they' re not ?
they' re communists !
they don' t believe in religion .
abe , go speak to them .
me ? !
i' d like to burn their house down , but i' m not allowed to light matches today .
at least they should do it out of respect for the neighbours .
they' re jewish , but they don' t believe in god , just stalin !
well , i' m just gonna go tell ' em a few things , that' s all .
hey !
what the hell are you doin ' ? !
can you turn that off ?
we' re praying .
praying ?
you should be working .
working for the benefit of your fellow man !
it is a sin to work today !
it' s a sin not to work !
oh , please !
today is the most holy day .
can' t you please turn off the radio ?
he' s been there over an hour .
yeah .
meanwhile the radio' s still on .
be careful .
the daughter believes in free love .
why do you say that ?
hear what happened to mrs silverman ?
she couldn' t sleep .
she was up one night taking a cup of tea , ... .. and she heard a car pull up at three in the morning .
so , you know mrs silverman .
she always likes to know what' s going on .
so she' s peeking out her front door , and there' s the girl across the street ... .. coming back from a folk singing thing with a tall coloured man .
you' re not gonna believe this , ceil .
she gives the guy a big , long kiss !
well , you can imagine how rose silverman reacted .
she had a stroke on the spot .
her arteries hardened .
the woman remained frozen , the teacup on the way to her mouth .
they never saw anything like it at the hospital .
i' m telling you , ceil , she was as stiff as a board .
i' m home .
abe , they' re still carryin ' on !
what' d you do there for over an hour ?
i talked .
or rather i listened .
hey , you didn' t eat ? !
i did eat .
abe , we' re fasting !
they' re right !
it' s silly !
oh , my god , abe !
i should fast to atone for my sins ?
what are my sins ?
who did i bother ?
the only sin is the exploitation of the worker by the bosses .
did the daughter get hold of you ?
see , the problem is not between man and some imaginary superbeing , ... .. it' s between man and the owners of 90 % of the world' s wealth .
what do you mean , " some imaginary superbeing " ?
you don' t believe in god ?
religion is the opium of the masses .
abe , god will punish you !
no .
god is not interested in ... in me .
he ...
what' s the matter ?
uh ...
abe ?
chest pains .
abe , really ?
abe , are you all right ?
i can' t breathe .
just relax .
just relax .
breathe out slowly .
abe , i told you god would punish you .
i' il get the doctor' s number .
maybe it' s indigestion .
what did you eat there ?
uh , some pork chops ...
pork chops ? !
and some clams .
and chocolate pudding .
abe , how could you do this ? !
and french fries .
you won' t eat my french fries , but you eat the commies ' french fries ? !
i' m gonna get him some bicarbonate .
he deserves an enema !
oh , ceil !
yeah , right !
hello , sports fans , and welcome to bill kern' s favourite sports legends .
now in my family , each person had his own favourite show .
for instance , my uncle abe was a great sports fan , ... .. and he always listened to bill kern .
today' s story is about a baseball player .
his name was kirby kyle , a lean southpaw from tennessee .
he played for the old st louis cardinals .
he threw fast , and he had a good curve ball , and all the hitters knew it .
he was a kid with a great future .
but one day he went hunting .
he loved to hunt , just like his father and his father' s father .
chasing a rabbit , he stumbled and his rifle went off .
the bullet entered his leg .
two days later , it was amputated .
they said he would never pitch again .
but the next season he was back .
he had one leg , but he had something more important .
he had ... heart .
the following winter , another accident cost kirby kyle an arm .
fortunately , not his pitching arm .
he had one leg and one arm , ... .. but more than that ... he had heart .
the next winter , going after duck , his gun misfired .
he was blind .
but he had instinct as to where to throw the baseball . lnstinct ... and heart .
the following year , kirby kyle was run over by a truck and killed .
the following season , ... .. he won 18 games in the big league in the sky .
this has been bill kern with another favourite sports legend .
while uncle abe loved the bill kern sports show , ... .. his wife ceil adored a very prominent ventriloquist , ... .. and this always used to drive abe crazy .
he' s a ventriloquist on the radio !
how do you know he' s not movin ' his lips ?
who cares ?
leave me alone .
ceil and abe' s daughter ruthie had her own favourite programme .
naturally it was one of those romantic boy crooners .
she and her girlfriends used to sit and swoon endlessly ... .. over the sentimental lyrics and velvety voice .
the local boys , of course , were all a little jealous , ... .. and they used to look on disgustedly , thinking the girls were real jerks . ?
then i' d rather have nothing at all
and now , ladies and gentlemen , the makers of general sparkplugs ... .. bring you the court of human emotions , ... .. with world famous counsellor on affairs of the human heart thomas abercrombie .
and now , my friends ...
my mother and father loved the show ... .. where people were helped with personal problems .
six years ago his mother came to live with us , and he won' t throw her out !
how can i throw my own mother out ? !
grab her by the throat and throw her out !
oh , just like that ?
yes !
she has to go out in the street !
why don' t you just stick a knife in here ? !
i' m not sticking a knife anywhere !
throw my mother out !
you take a knife !
l found the show silly .
l' d imagine my parents on it , airing their standard complaints .
he never finishes what he starts .
we' re forced to live with my relatives thank god for them !
and i could have married sam slotkin .
sam slotkin' s dead .
but while he was alive he was working !
she' d be lost without her family .
and you should see ' em .
they' re like the huns !
lf i' d married a more encouraging woman ...
so who do you think is right ?
i think you both deserve each other .
what does that mean ?
we didn' t come here to be insulted .
i love him , but what did i do to deserve him ?
naturally , my folks never were on the mr abercrombie programme .
ln fact , the only radio celebrity any of us ever really met in person ... .. was the 1 4 year old mathematical genius of a quiz show my father loved ... .. called " the whiz kids " .
hey , tess .
that' s one of the kids from the radio .
it' s a whiz kid .
hey , joe , it' s one of the whiz kids from the radio .
hey , excuse me ?
uh , pardon me ?
we really enjoy your son on the radio .
you' re a real genius .
yes .
i have a 160 lq , and that is extraordinary , by any standards .
and this is our son .
say hello .
hi .
charmed to make your acquaintance .
although perhaps " charmed " is really overstating it .
your son is a whiz at math .
quick , what' s 1 754 into 1 3 million ?
martin !
this palooka can' t even pass a simple arithmetic exam !
and now , if you' il excuse us ...
boy , what a kid .
so well spoken .
why can' t you be like that ?
why can' t you be a genius ? !
i' il tell you why : because you' re too busy listening to the radio !
put your hat on !
put his hat on .
honest to goodness !
?
there' s a song in the air ?
but the fair seorita ?
doesn' t seem to care ?
for the song in the air
aunt bea listened almost exclusively to music .
because of her , i grew up hearing the most wonderful songs . ?
she won' t think that i am just a fool ?
serenading a mule
there are certain songs that , no matter where i am , ... .. the minute i hear them l get instant memory flashes .
( ?
you and l " by tommy dorsey )
for instance , every time i hear this song i think of evelyn goorwitz , ... .. who i had a crush on , but who didn' t like me .
l remember her pretty girlfriend treated me like i had the plague .
but eventually persistence won out and i did break down her resistance .
? l' m gonna buy a paper doll ?
that i can call my own ...
l can never hear this song without recalling my parents ' anniversary .
lt was the only time i ever saw them kiss .
lt was a very wonderful memory . ?
with their flirty flirty eyes ?
will have to flirt with dollies that are real ?
when i come home at night ?
she will be waiting ?
she' il be the truest doll in all this world ... ?
lay that pistol down , babe , lay that pistol down ...
now when this song was popular , l remember a strange little event .
my friend andrew and i built a snowman outside the school .
he supplemented its anatomy with a particular vegetable . ?
until one night she caught me right ?
and now i' m on the run ?
oh , lay that pistol down , babe , lay that pistol down ?
pistol packin ' mama , lay that pistol down
another song we listened to was by carmen miranda .
l can only think of my cousin ruthie and how much she loved it .

mairzy doats " )
mairzy doats " .
i remember when i first heard that song .
l always associate its popularity with a bizarre incident , ... .. when mr zipsky , normally a very quiet man , ... .. had a nervous breakdown and ran amok through the shopping district . ?
a little bit jumbled and jivey ?
sing " mares eat oats and does eat oats and little lambs eat ivy " ?
oh , mairzy doats and dozy doats and liddle lamzy divey ?
a kiddley divey too , wouldn' t you ? ?
a kiddley divey too , wouldn' t you ?
my most vivid memory connected with an old radio song ... .. l associate with the time aunt bea and her then boyfriend chester ... .. took me into new york to the movies .
lt was the first time i' d ever seen the radio city music hall , ... .. and it was like entering heaven .
l just never saw anything so beautiful in my life . ? l hope i never waken ? lt' s more than i could bear ?
to find that i' m forsaken ? lf you' re a fantasy ?
then i' m content to be ? ln love with loving you ?
and pray my dream comes true ? l long to kiss you ?
but i would not dare ? l' m so afraid ?
that you may vanish ? ln the air ?
so , darling ? lf our romance should break up ? l hope i never wake up ? lf you are but ... ?
a dream
ahh !
lightning !
now remember sally the cigarette girl ?
well , i wanna come back to her now , ... .. because there are some great radio stories associated with sally .
she was one of those characters that are always around when things happen .
plus , she eventually became the star of aunt ceil' s favourite show .
but that' s later .
right now we find her struggling , ... .. a coat check girl in a nightclub run by a mobster .
lt' s after hours .
? lf i didn' t care ?
would i feel this way ? ? lf this isn' t love ?
then why do i thrill ? ?
and what makes my head go round and round ?
while my heart stands still ? ? lf i didn' t care ?
would it be the same ?
oh , my god !
you killed mr davis !
i saw you shoot him !
help !
oh , my god !
help !
where are you taking me ?
shut up .
you' re gettin ' yours .
it' s nothin ' personal .
it' s just bad luck you were a witness .
my whole life , i had bad luck .
me too .
where are you from ?
brooklyn .
yeah ?
me too .
whereabouts ?
canarsie .
me too !
yeah ?
85th street .
i was 86th street .
no kiddin ' ?
you must know joey' s clam house .
i ate there all the time .
this is a coincidence .
i meet nobody from the old neighbourhood in years , ... .. l finally do , and i gotta kill her .
you were freddie white' s daughter , huh ?
i remember you when you had little pigtails and braces on your teeth .
you were the cutest little girl in the neighbourhood .
here you are .
you need bullets too ?
here .
grazie , mamma , grazie .
honey , you said you enjoyed the peppers .
yeah .
they' re delicious .
eat some more of these , because you said you enjoyed them very , very much .
thank you .
where you gonna dump her body ?
ln jersey , mama .
four in the morning , you wanna dump her body in jersey ? !
dump her in red hook !
sweetheart , look , these shrimps are nice and fresh .
i made them today .
listen , i ain' t gonna squeal , honest !
i can keep a secret .
i know everything about everybody on broadway !
really .
places i work , i got secrets on everybody .
think i go around talkin ' ?
but what do you do ?
she sings , mama .
oh , yeah ?
that' s nice .
i can act too .
i' d just do anything to get on radio .
i' d be happy to give the weather report , or interview people ...
i think i' m a natural .
i' m a great dancer .
but you can' t dance on radio .
i know .
cos they can' t see you !
oh , madonna mia !
wait .
come here , rocco .
i got to tell you something .
you come over here with me .
viene , viene , rocco .
listen to me .
you don' t have to worry about that girl .
she' s not too fast up here .
she wouldn' t make no trouble .
i feel sorry for her .
she wants to get into radio so badly .
i think some men take advantage .
she' s so pretty .
listen to me .
then your cousin angelo could help her .
yes , because he knows everybody on radio .
he could get her any little part , because they owe him this favour .
all right , now they not only decide not to bump sally off , ... .. but they get a relative to ask an unrefusable favour on her behalf .
l don' t know if people were bribed or threatened , ... .. but she suddenly found herself with a big acting part ... .. on a very serious dramatic radio show that was doing chekhov .
now the payoff to the story .
the country never got to hear her act .
at the last minute fate stepped in .
the japanese have bombed pearl harbor .
this morning a surprise attack was made , with enormous casualties to the us .
we are pre empting this show to bring you a special report ... .. and a statement from the president of the united states .
aren' t we gonna do the show ?
what do we do , come back monday ?
who is pearl harbor ?
ln one terrible moment , world events came between the public and sally white .
and suddenly the nation was at war .
and lives changed .
and sally , like everyone else , found herself doing her bit . ?
i don' t wanna walk without you ?
baby ?
walk without my arm about you ?
baby ?
i thought the day you left me behind
?
i' d take a stroll ?
and get you right off my mind ?
but now i find that ?
i don' t wanna walk without the sunshine ?
why' d you have to turn off all that ... ?
sunshine ?
?
oh , baby , please come back ?
or you' il break my heart for me ?
cos i ... ?
don' t wanna walk without you ?
no ... sirree ?
let' s remember pearl harbor ...
my friends and i , acting on advice from the radio g man biff baxter , ... .. collected scrap iron every day after school .
our local soda jerk , rita , joined the wacs and looked good in uniform .
and mrs riley had a victory garden in her flowerpots .
on the radio , stories changed .
now the japanese and germans were the villains .
ok , you axis rats !
i know you got submarines sneaking around our coast !
ve have no submarines .
yes , you do !
u boats and airplanes !
but we americans are always on the lookout , always alert !
take that !
ok , i think you' ve learned your lesson .
one american with courage is worth 20 of you !
come along .
uncle sam knows what to do with axis rats .
my friends and i hung on biff baxter' s every word .
when he said to watch for enemy planes and submarines lurking off the coast , ... .. our parents laughed .
but we took it seriously .
remember , if we see any german planes , i do have a number to call , ok ?
oh , look at that .
hey , look , there' s one !
no , no , that' s one of ours .
i don' t think the germans can get over here so easy .
they can !
the masked avenger says they' re working on rockets !
hey , look , a japanese bomber !
let me see !
get off .
hey , wow !
look in that window !
let me see !
let me see !
what do you see ?
jesus , what legs !
hey , it' s my turn !
?
jungle drums were madly beating ? ln the glare of eerie light ?
while the natives kept repeating ?
ancient jungle rites ?
all at once the dusky warriors began to raise their arms to skies above ...
oh , god , i can hardly breathe ! ?
and the native then stepped forward to chant to ?
his voodoo goddess of love ?
ah , great babalu ? l' m so lost and forsaken ...
later that afternoon we all walked down to the water' s edge .
the talk had shifted away from nazis to more important matters .
boy , she was pretty .
she was nothin ' special .
she was all right .
but my favourite is rita hayworth .
i like betty grable .
i like dana andrews .
you kidding ?
dana andrews is a man .
she is ?
didn' t you ever see crash dive ?
with a name like dana ?
say , guys , wanna look for planes ?
i' m going home .
i' il come with you .
let' s go listen to the radio .
l didn' t care if the guys went home .
l was in a funny mood that afternoon .
l just stood there , looking out at the atlantic .
my mind was thinking about life , and women , and a million different things .
and then suddenly i saw it .
lt was just like biff baxter described it .
lt came up and went under so mysteriously and silently ... .. that i couldn' t believe my eyes .
l never told anyone about it afterward because i doubted my own experience .
besides , i knew that no one would believe me .
no one except ...
biff baxter .
?
they' re either too young or too old ?
they' re either too grey or too grassy green ?
the pickin' s are poor and the crop is lean ?
what' s good is in the army ?
what' s left will never harm me ?
they' re either too old or too young ?
so , darling , you' il never get stung ?
tomorrow i' il go hiking with that eagle scout unless ?
i get a call from grandpa for a snappy game of chess
what are you doin ' ?
i' m outta nylons .
but lots of girls paint them on now .
better hope it doesn' t rain .
oh , right .
oh , i really think this could be the one .
i hope so .
he' s so good looking , he' s good natured , he has his own business ...
and his fiance died last year , so he' s obviously marriage minded .
how come he' s not in the army ?
he has flat feet .
but that' s his only drawback .
you really think you could love a man with fallen arches ?
i know , you think i' m too demanding .
i do .
you have these qualities you demand , ... .. and when you meet a nice man you disqualify him for the smallest fault .
that' s not true .
so what was wrong with nat bernstein ?
he wore white socks with a tuxedo .
that' s not a good enough reason .
then when you fall in love there' s always something wrong with him .
you know , they all seem fine .
i don' t know .
you got this sixth sense for picking losers .
sometimes i wonder , do you really wanna get married ?
more than anything .
don' t you think i wanna have a child before it' s too late ?
god , how i envy you .
i just want it to be perfect .
it' s never perfect . lf you wait for perfect , you don' t get pregnant , ... .. you wind up with your teeth in a glass of water .
easy for you to say .
i compromised when i picked martin .
i mean , i wanted someone tall and handsome and rich ...
three out of three , i gave up .
i think you did right to compromise .
why ?
you don' t think i could' ve done better than martin ?
i know .
you could' ve married sam slotkin .
so why didn' t you ?
oh , sam slotkin was a mortician .
he always smelled from formaldehyde .
and don' t think that martin didn' t compromise with me .
he always dreamed of being a business tycoon , having a beautiful blonde wife ...
i tell him the day he becomes a tycoon i' il dye my hair .
well , at least you have each other .
that' s all i want , someone .
so you have to lower your standards a little .
you know , marrying for love is a very recent idea .
ln the old country , they didn' t marry for love .
a man married a woman because he needed an extra mule .
but you' re the one that listens to all the romantic soap operas .
well , i like to daydream .
but i have my two feet firmly planted on my husband .
first we' il go to the movie , then eat , then maybe i' il ask him back here .
although i don' t wanna seem too forward .
hey , you really like this guy , huh ?
oh , i like him so much .
we' il say a prayer for you .
and then maybe this time next year you' il look like me .
you know what i was thinkin ' , tess ?
i could learn engraving , buy a machine .
not another get rich scheme !
i could make a few dollars engraving .
let me tell you the beauty part .
when you engrave gold rings and lockets , ... .. what you cut out when you make the letters falls on the table .
it' s gold dust .
forget it .
it' il be like all the other ideas .
gold dust , and the engraver owns it !
hold my wool .
lf it' s a girl , we could name it lola .
lola ?
you want her to be a stripper ?
and if it' s a boy , lionel ?
no son of mine will be named lionel .
i want an l name , after my uncle louie .
your uncle louie .
how about " louse " ?
the news is not good tonight .
reports are that nazi tank divisions ... .. are pushing american infantrymen back in furious armoured warfare .
meanwhile , japanese have taken control of two more islands in the philippines ... .. and are advancing on american ... .. john jenkins broadcasting from london .
the bombs are falling even as we speak .
the morale of the boys is good here at guadalcanal , despite heavy losses .
what do you think , martin ?
you think hitler' s gonna win ?
i wonder about the wisdom of bringing new life into the world .
come on , lights out .
blackout .
oh , god , another air raid drill !
between the nazis and the communists , give me those reds !
stick to your fish .
what do they want , those nazis ?
to slaughter everyone on the planet ?
the nazis , the communists ...
the world would be better off without any of ' em .
you know what wc fields said ?
to settle a war , the leaders involved should meet in a stadium ... .. and fight it out with socks filled with horse manure .
hey , put that light out .
wake him up to see the searchlights .
no , no .
let him sleep .
he' s got school .
it' s so beautiful .
what a world .
it could be so wonderful if it wasn' t for certain people .
later that night l was awakened .
by the sound of our radio in the kitchen .
i had a very nice time .
yes , it was wonderful .
it was such a clear night out .
you could see all the stars .
i think i should be going .
oh , don' t go .
it' s not late .
i have to drive back to the bronx .
fred ... you must know i have a little crush on you .
please , bea .
what is it ?
what' s wrong ?
nothing .
it' s just that i ...
i ...
what' s wrong ?
ls it still your fiance ?
it' s been such a long period of grief .
it' s not fair to you .
i know .
i know .
it' s just that every time i hear that song on the radio ... .. my memory goes back to leonard .
that was our song .
leonard ?
my beloved .
you never said your fianc' s name was leonard .
how could l ?
i see .
well ... just calm yourself .
would you like a drink ?
no .
just relax .
it' s a nice song .
you guys , shut up !
the principal' s coming !
sit down !
good morning , class .
i' d like you to know that your regular teacher mrs nash is ill today ... .. and you will have a substitute teacher .
now , now .
children , children , please , be quiet .
no noise .
i want you to be very good today .
i want you to be on your very best behaviour .
miss gordon , would you please come in ?
?
babalu ...
they' re all yours .
?
ba ba ba ba ba babalu ...
ok , class , we' re going to begin today ...
well , first let me tell you what my name is .
i' m miss gordon .
oh , god , we' re all goin ' straight to hell .
l conclude the miss gordon episode with just one observation .
for some miraculous reason , it' s a wonderful feeling having a teacher ... .. you' ve seen dance naked in front of a mirror .
but that' s how it happened .
l want to take a minute to tell you how sally wound up .
because it' s one of the radio legends of the time . ?
get regular with re lax ?
start every day the re lax way ?
your system will feel so great ?
you' il want to relax on the top of the empire state ?
get regular with re lax ?
start every day the re lax way ?
when your tummy' s not so hot ?
remember x marks the spot ?
get regular with re lax ?
the re lax way
no , no , more feeling !
it has no inner life .
we need the name of the product to be enunciated a little more clearly .
i' il deal with the performers .
cut the phrase " x marks the spot " .
people will be reminded of ex lax .
you' re being too touchy .
why take the chance ?
let' s run it again , sally .
three , four ... ?
get regular with re lax ?
start every day the re lax way
?
your system will feel so great ...
no , no !
like this : ?
re lax , re lax ...
well , what ...
what should i be thinking inside ?
think laxative .
think soothing relief .
please , i' il give her her motivation .
laxative , darling .
you crave one .
try again .
three , four ... ?
get regular with re lax ?
start every day the re lax way ?
your system will feel so great ?
you' il want to relax on the top of the empire state ...
it' s not the commercial .
it' s the girl .
she has no flair for it .
she' s the best to audition .
what do you think , mr monroe ?
i think she' s correct to represent my laxative .
she' s fresh , her voice is natural , and she does it simply .
definitely .
what do you think , doris ?
i don' t like her .
get rid of her .
sally hung around broadway and tried to break into broadcasting .
but the only roles she ever seemed to get were in the bedroom .
then one day , as she' d later tell her biographer , ... .. the voice of god told her to take diction lessons , and her whole life changed .
hark .
i hear the cannons roar .
ls it the king approaching ?
hark , i hear the cannons roar . ls it the king approaching ?
hark , i hear the cannons roar . ls it the king approaching ?
hark , i heat the cannons roar .
ls it the king approaching ?
no , no , no .
the cannons roar .
the cannons roar .
the cannons roar .
hark , i hear the cannons roar .
ls it the king approaching ?
sally practised faithfully every day for many months .
her natural speech was a great obstacle to get over .
yet through diligence and perseverance , ... .. plus a special , intimate knowledge of many broadway personalities , ... .. it was only a question of time before she emerged a full blown star .
ahh ...
and now , the makers of lady lydia facial cream ... .. bring you sally white and her gay white way .
good evening , and cheers to you all out there .
my first exclusive .
clark gable was in town this week , in uniform .
and where did he go ?
to el morocco , naturally .
that brunette on his arm was lolly hayes , an up and coming starlet .
hope you had fun , clark .
and didn' t rita hayworth look stunning last night at the copacabana ?
oh , abe , how come you never take me to the copacabana or el morocco ?
take the gas pipe .
you' d be happier with rita hayworth ?
you gotta ask ?
those show business celebrities get divorced every six weeks .
but we' re together for ever .
l may take the gas pipe .
just once i' d like to eat at the stork club .
they don' t take jews in the stork club .
no jews , no coloured .
abe , this is the united states of america .
yeah ?
try taking minnie' s maid cleopatra to the stork club you' d get kerb service .
don' t hit it , abe .
you' il break it .
i know what i' m doing !
naturally , he did break it .
he sent it out to be repaired , and a week later i was sent to pick it up .
my parents told me that , since it was so heavy , i could take it home by taxi .
but i had a brilliant plan .
l figured if i carried it , l could keep the cab fare .
the first half mile was barely manageable .
pretty soon i realised i' d have to give in and that i was not gonna save any money .
thanks .
you ? !
i' m helpin ' out a friend , you know .
come on , get in .
that' s how i found out what my father did for a living .
for some strange reason , he was ashamed of it .
even then he didn' t admit it .
lt didn' t bother me one bit though .
l loved him .
ln fact , i gave him the biggest tip he got all day .
jimson' s coffee is having a slogan contest .
you write it in to their radio show and win a refrigerator .
fraud !
what' s a good slogan ?
wait , i got one .
how about " a coffee with oomph " ?
that' s terrible .
oh , yeah ?
what' s your idea , big shot ?
good to the last drop " ?
that' s maxwell house .

i knew i' d heard it .

now put your arm around me .
put your arm around me .
nice and easy .
ceil , this is it .
this is it .
i' m so excited !
a baby !
i can' t wait !
i want a girl .
you should get a girl .
abe , isn' t this wonderful ?
you want another baby ?
slow .
slow .
slow .
you got the bag ?
the suitcase is in the closet .
there you go , honey .
you did a good job .
you did a good job too , martin .
i did a great job .
tess , you haven' t met sy yet .
pleased to meet you , sy .
my pleasure .
congratulations .
oh , and this is my brother in law abe .
and ceil .
we better be going .
we' re taking your son into manhattan .
oh , great .
that' il be fun .
sy has a new car , and we' il do some driving ...
don' t lose him , huh ?
we' il take good care of him .
i' il be good , don' t worry .
have a good time .
that' s nice , bea .
thanks a lot .
don' t give ' em any trouble , all right ?
bye , now .
bye .
he' s nice .
nice lookin ' .
he' s not bad .
i like him .
why is she wasting her time with him ?
he' s married .
really ?
he' s supposed to be getting out of it , ... .. but you know how tight some women hold on .
tell me about it !
well , i hope she knows what she' s doin ' .
martin , are you sure you wanna call the baby ellen ?
sure , why not ?
ln memory of your cousin eddie .
ln memory ?
he' s not dead yet .
he should be .
aunt bea and her boyfriend gave me one of the best days i ever had .
they took me to my first radio show .
and if that wasn' t thrill enough , aunt bea was chosen as a contestant .
you' re from rockaway , huh ?
yes .
and what do you do , bea ?
i' m a book keeper .
oh .
for a minute i thought you said " beekeeper " .
i' d hate to get stung .
now , you chose as your topic " fish " .
how' d you get to know about fish ?
well , my brother in law brings home fish from sheepshead bay all the time , ... .. and after a while you get to identify them .
ah , that' s great .
i get it .
well , can you tell me what this is ?
aunt bea had no trouble .
years of living with uncle abe had turned us all into ichthyologists .
and finally , how about this one ?
that' s a ... a flounder .
no , no , no .
that' s a fluke .
you' re sure ?
that' s a fluke .
well , this is no fluke !
you' ve won 50 silver dollars !
boy , a chemistry set !
i can' t believe it !
i' ve always wanted one of these !
i can' t wait to get home and open this !
this is fantastic !
bea ?
it was a lovely afternoon .
a lovely afternoon .
gosh , i almost forgot what a fluke looked like .
good thing i remembered .
this time next week we won' t have anything hanging over our heads .
i' il be free of all my obligations .
are you sure , sy ?
i' ve only stayed because of the children .
i' m telling you , bea .
mark my words .
this time next week i' il be a free man .
and the most expensive one in the store , too !
i can' t believe this !
so what are we gonna do with the rest of the money ?
what aunt bea did with the rest of the money ... .. was treat us all to a broadway dance palace .
she and sy seemed very much in love , and she seemed happy .
but it was not to be .
because after a week , sy did not leave his wife and children .
nor did he after two weeks , nor ever .
and as the year came to a close , ... .. aunt bea would soon be back to her old dreams of finding a true love .
still , on this night no one had any thoughts ... .. except what a wonderful time we were all having .
ohh !
oh , my god !
did you do this ?
i' il kill you !
when i catch you , i' il kill you !
come here !
don' t you run away from me !
what happened ?
look what he did to my good coat !
what ?
he made purple dye and dyed it purple !
that' s the coat i gave you for our anniversary ? !
you don' t hit him !
i' il hit him !
i can hit him !
you' re too easy with him .
i' il hit him !
abe ?
have you seen mama' s teeth ?
she left ' em in a glass of water and she can' t find them .
the kids were playin ' hockey with ' em .
playing hockey with mama' s teeth ? !
they' re about the same size as a puck .
oh , listen !
listen , that' s the conga !
my teacher said you could meet very interesting men in a conga line .
come on , ruthie !
come on , ceil !
i can do this !
one , two , three , conga !
one , two , three , conga !
come here !
you' re making it worse on yourself !
come here !
you can meet men doing this ?
that' s what she said .
you' re gonna pay for it this time !
we interrupt this programme with a special bulletin .
emergency workers outside stroudsberg , pennsylvania , ... .. are working to remove an eight year old girl who has fallen down a well .
polly phelps fell down the well while playing with friends , ... .. and has been lodged at the bottom since twelve noon .
reports will be coming to you live on the spot where this tense drama is unfolding .
we don' t know if the girl is still living , ... .. although authorities are predicting they will rescue the child within moments .
it' s been seven hours , and still workers have not been able ... .. to contact or free eight year old polly phelps .
can you hear me ?
polly ?
can you hear anything ?
meanwhile , members of the press are here in abundance .
this field is illuminated by the eerie incandescence ... .. of searchlights and flashbulbs .
the anxious parents , mr and mrs phelps , stand by waiting , ... .. hoping for some word , some sign .
we' il continue to broadcast live and bring you details as they unfold .
l' m sure all americans listening to their radios everywhere ... .. are praying for polly phelps and the phelps family .
please , god , don' t let her die !
oh , god ...
the fire department and local emergency squads ... .. have been on the job for many hours .
the difficulty seems to be that the well is quite narrow , and the surrounding ...
no , wait ...
wait ...
it looks like he has something .
he' s tugging the rope .
they' re raising the rope very , very slowly .
they seem to be close to a rescue .
police have her .
stand by .
we' re coming to you live .
don ?
don , is ...
don ?
oh , god , this is terrible , ladies and gentlemen .
the child ... is not alive .
polly phelps is dead .
after all the efforts and prayers , the little girl is dead .
this is tragic ... just tragic .
we are going to end our broadcast , ladies and gentlemen .
l know that all america shares the grief of the phelps family .
this has been a sudden , unexpected human tragedy .
good evening , and happy new year .
we' re broadcasting live from the king cole room , ... .. where everyone is here to welcome in 1 944 .
i used to work in this place .
now i' m here with , of all people , the masked avenger !
beware , evildoers , wherever you are !
now where are they ?
do you see them ?
they' re there .
hello , everybody !
listen to that .
doesn' t it sound wonderful at that nightclub ?
yeah .
why aren' t we there , abe ?
cos we' re here .
don' t you wanna hit the hot spots and drink champagne from my slipper ?
i can' t take that much liquid .
besides , only creeps and crazy people go out on new year' s eve .
then you should definitely go out .
there are those who drink champagne at clubs , ... .. and us , who listen to them drink champagne .
i heard breakfast with lrene and roger this morning .
they said they were going to the king cole room tonight .
roger and lrene are rich and famous .
they have a radio show .
they wear fancy clothes , they hobnob with their celebrity friends , ... .. they go to all the nightclubs .
what , you think they' re happier than us ?

it has the most marvellous view of the city .

oh , it' s freezing up here .
it' s just amazing .
amazing , but it' s freezing up here !

it' s gotten so overcast .
and all the lights .
what a city this is !
another year is passing .
i hope 1 944 turns out well .
they pass so quickly .
where do they all go ?
so quickly .
and then we get old .
and we never knew what any of it was about .
that' s right .
i wonder if future generations will ever even hear about us .
it' s not likely .
after enough time ... everything passes .
i don' t care how big we are , or how important in their lives .
six , five , four , ... .. three , two , one !
happy new year !

i have a feeling in my bones .

a little red snapper !

happy new year , martin .
happy new year , tess .
hey , pop , happy new year .

l never forgot that new year' s eve , ... .. when aunt bea awakened me to watch 1 944 come in .
and i' ve never forgotten any of those people , ... .. or any of the voices we used to hear on the radio .
although the truth is , with the passing of each new year' s eve , ... .. those voices do seem to grow dimmer and dimmer .
