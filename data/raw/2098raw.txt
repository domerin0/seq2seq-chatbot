you must be the new boxer .

not bad for an old fart .
how areyou doing ? .
happy birthday .
thankyou .
i was just talking aboutyou .
i' ve come to defend myself .
hey , rememberwhen i told you that girls can' t be boxers ? .
yeah , i remember .
girls excuse me
women have a lower center of gravity .
maybe they' re more grounded once they build strength .
it makes ' em a different kind ofboxer .
are you serious ? .
it' s just a theory .
the way to prove it is to get more women in that ring .
one twenty six .
must be all that muscle you' re building .
what division ? .
you' re a featherweight .
you' re not mingling .
huh ? .
this is a party .
you should be dancin ' .
i' m not much of a dancer .
sureyou are .
i mean , you dance , right ? .
hector says my footwork gets sloppy .
looks okay to me .
let' s box .
come on .
no , bro , not in hector' s kitchen .
but you' re all serious and shit .
come on .

hector , i gotta go .
butyou just got here .
sureyou can' t stay longer ? .
no .
it was betterwith the ice cream .
howyou feel ? .
tired .
this is a waste oftime .
look , adrian' s got a bout coming up .
i don' t mean to insultyou
what' s the big deal ? .
there' s no one near adrian' s weight to sparwith today .
might as well give my gal a chance .
i don' t like it , hector .
tell him to think ofher as a warm up .
this equality crap has gone too far .
should we just forget about it ? .
no .
just get rough on her in the first round and hectorwill stop it real early .
go ahead .
come on .
what' d i tell you ? .
hit me !

i' m not gonna fight him ifhe doesn' t hit me .
both ofyou , enough bullshit !

a gender blindamateur boxing proposal ... is a statewide initiative that responds to the ongoing demands ... for officially sanctioned amateur matches ... while also addressing the expanding presence offemales in the sport .
male and female amateurs within the same weight class ... are allowed to compete with each other in the ring .
now that they' re m ixi ng up the guys with the girls ... you could have a lot more opponents .
they got you fighting this girl from buffalo next week .
and you can have a fight everyweek ifyou want .
hey , vince .
long time no see .
let me get this straight .
she' s had three amateur matches and she' s already turning pro ? .
that' s a little premature , don' tyou think ? .
damn it !
trainer says kid' s got a high fever .
dead on his feet with strep throat .
i' d fight thatyellow kid with one arm .
missy from buffalo' s 33 years old and she can make some money as a pro .
the fight' s totally called off ? .
why botherwith small fry stuff when she can be on tv ? .
calm down .
there' il be other matches .
not soon enough .
it' s a pathetic turnout , but i' ve gotta give these people their $1 0 worth .
and half of my fighters haven' t showed up .
come on , ira .
let' s just see this thing in action .
all right .
ifit turns ugly , you can' t say i didn' t warn you .
nervous ? .
no .
all right .
remember , you' re judged on points .
be aggressive and make legal punches .
nervous ? .
no .

this athletic shit makes you , like , a class achiever .
you think so ? .
yeah .
well , now that i got school all covered ...
i only have the world outside ofthese walls to fuck up .
damn , girl , that' s grim .
it' s the truth .
holy shit .
what ? .
ex hundred percent man is toyour left .
stop being so obvious .
damn , girl .
that' s him with the forearms ? .
yeah .
well , ifhe' s such an ex , what' s he doing here ? .
i don' t know .
maybe he' s a glutton for punishment or something .
a glutton for punishment , loca ?
yeah .
shit , you better go over there .
i heard you fought ray .
you' re right .
he' s a fucking case .
i feel pretty fucking stupid out here , waiting for school to be let out .
then don' t .
right .
so , where' s yourwoman when she doesn' t have her tongue in your ear ? .
or doyou only bring her out for special occasions ? .
i came here to say i' m sorry .
sorry forwhat , adrian ? .
proving toyour friends you can still snag the pretty girl ? .
you gotyourself a fuckin ' trophy now .
bet it makes you feel real big inside , huh ? .
i don' t feel too big right now .
as a matter offact , i feel pretty fucking small around you .
must be nice .
yeah , well , it' s not .
you and me , we just met each other , right ? .
we barely know each other .
no problem .
so , then leave .
maybe i don' t wanna leave .
why ? .
you' re offthe hook now , free to do whatever .
that' s not all i wanted to say .
i told karina it wasn' t gonna work out with her .
i told her i finally met somebody that ... makes something happen for me .
just ' cause it' s true doesn' t mean i know what to do about it , okay ? .
you got anything to say to that ? .
so i' m someone , huh ? .
yeah , you are .
i was wrong .
there' s more than one ofyou out there .
and i hear she' s good .
she' s a southpaw , and she' s won most ofher matches ' cause ofit .
these next couple ofweeks i' m gonna trainyou so hard ... you' il be wired like a machine .
there' s all kinds offighters out there .
the more versatile you are , the better preparedyou are .
you gotta learn how to manage your power , ' cause you got more ofit ... than people realize .
howyou gonna do that ?
first , you' re gonna strengthen yourjab .
feels funny , ri ght ? .
southpaw now .
okay ? .
i ' m ricky .
i ' m ricky .
come on .
good .
j ab , jab .
very nice .
very clever .
girls , i want a good , clean fight .
it' s my decision if one ofyou needs a standing eight count .
ifyou score a knockdown , go to the farthest neutral corner ... and stay there .
don' t come out until i tell you to resume fighting .
got it ? .
let' s go .
the key to this is not losing your cool .
the judges are gonna give that to stiles ' cause they see her hands moving .
remind them you' re in there with her .
that was nice .
okay , your punches are making contact .
your defense is strong .
butyou gotta stagger her .
these judges won' t giveyou any points ifthey can' t seeyou slowing her down .
stop .
ladies andgentlemen , we have a split decision .
hilljudges 29 27 for guzman .
ferrarajudges 29 27 for stiles .
andersonjudges 28 27 for guzman .
and the bout goes to guzman .
based on the results ofthe preliminary matches ... you' ve been advanced to the fi nals .
even though the first fight was stopped ? .
yep .
you scored better than a lot of the kids in your division .
that' s great .
so , uh , who' s next ? .
come on , cal .
you saw herwith stiles .
what' s going on here ? .
i' il tell you what .
this rinky dink operation excuse my candor , ira
iet this goddamn gender blind program get out ofhand .
you signed him up for it .
boys are different from girls .
what' s so wrong about saying it out loud ? .
boys are different from girls .
no girl has what it takes to be a boxer .
neither do most boys .
i' m gonna petition the fight .
oh , come on , you' re the one always complaining ... you can' t get enough matches foryour guys .
adrian' s young .
he works hard .
he' s a good looking kid .
ayear from now i want him grooming for the pros .
then you' re pushing him .
you can' t humiliate my guy like this !
ira , i need your support .
fileyour protest , but don' t ask me to get involved .
i will saythis .
let the boxers box , and that' il speak for itself .
unbelievable .
hector , ifthis happens ...
i' m telling adrian no mercy .
you understand ? .
yeah .
so will she .
this is crazy .
and cal' s right .
this fucks with my record .
it' s your amateur record .
we know each other' s habits .
fuck !
come on .
stiles makes fights , right ? .
you said ityourself .
you have lostyour mind .
i got it .
i won' t make myweight .
what ? .
i' il eat for a fucking change .
i won' t fightyou , and that' s it .
who says you' re the only one fighting ? .
i' m sorry , diana .
i haven' t trained all this time to be stuck in a ring with a girl .
stuckwith a girl .
okay .
stuckwith you .
you' re afraid i mightwin .
no .
you' re gonna play it all manly and protective on me now .
look , i' m just being honest .
you' re just like any other guy .
oh , yeah ? .
what kind ofa guy goes around beating up a girl that
that he what ? .
what ? .
just forget it .
it' s not right .
fine .
all i know ... is ifyou don' t fight me in this match ... you' re less ofa man than you thinkyou are .
what is it that you want from me anyway ? .
you want me to takeyou a little more seriously , huh ? .
is that whatyou want ? .
is thatyour idea of prince charming ? .
you need to takeyourself a little more seriously .
who' s the one who said it was all about the challenge ? .
who' s the one who said that they love to win ? .
well , i' m not gonna love winning this one .
then maybeyou shouldn' t be a boxer .
oh , saycanyousee
bythe dawn' s earlylight
whatsoproudly we hailed
at the twilight' s last gleaming
whose broadstripes and bright stars
through the perilous fight
o' er the ramparts we watched
were so gallantly streaming
and the rockets ' red glare
the bombs bursting in air

this seat is saved for someone .
that our flag was still there
