how are you doing , keaton ?
i can' t feel my legs ... ... keyser .
ready ?
what time is it ?
twelve thirty .
it all started in new york six weeks ago .
a truck loaded with stripped gun parts got jacked outside of queens .
the driver didn' t see anybody but somebody fucked up .
he heard a voice .
sometimes , that' s all you need .
mr. mcmanus ?
christ !
don' t you fucking guys ever sleep ?
we have a warrant for your arrest .
fuck you !
todd hockney ?
who wants to know ?
new york police department .
shit .
freeze !
sure you brought enough guys ?
it' s quite simple , really .
a restaurant that changes with the taste ... without losing the overall aesthetic .
in other words , the atmosphere will not be painted on the walls .
well , let me give you an example ...
this i had to see for myself .
david .
i' m in a meeting .
time for another one .
everyone , this is david kujan .
special agent kujan .
u. s. customs .
these gentlemen are from the new york police department .
you look good , keaton .
better that i would have thought .
you have a problem , mr. keaton ?
small matter of a stolen truck loaded with guns .
mr. keaton ?
would you excuse us for a moment ?
we have some questions to ask you downtown .
no , no , please ... sit down .
this is ...
this is a small problem .
enjoy the meal .
it didn' t make sense that i' d be there .
i mean , these guys were hardcore hijackers ... ... but there i was .
at that point i wasn' t scared .
i knew i hadn' t done anything they could do me for .
besides , it was fun .
i got to make like i was notorious .
allright , you all know the drill .
when your number is called , step forward and repeat the phrase ... ... you' ve been given .
understand ?
number 1 ... ... step forward .
hand me the keys , you fucking cocksucker .
number 2 , step forward .
gimme the fucking keys , you fucking cocksucker motherfucker !
knock it off !
get back !
number 3 , step forward .
hand me the keys , you cocksucker .
in english , please .
excuse me ?
in english .
hand me the fucking keys , you cocksucker , what the fuck ...
number 4 , step forward .
it was bullshit .
the whole wrap was a set up .
hand me the keys , you fucking cocksucker .
it was all the cops ' fault .
you don' t put guys like that into a room together .
who knows what can happen .
hand me the keys , you fucking cocksucker .
this has really got to be ... ... embarrassing for you guys .
they drilled us all night .
somebody was pissed about that truck getting hijacked , and the cops had nothing .
they were hoping somebody would slip up and give them something to go on .
they knew we wouldn' t fight it because they knew how to lean on us .
they' d been doing it forever .
i mean , our rights went out the window .
it was a violation .
i mean , disgraceful .
they went after mcmanus first .
top notch entry man .
what truck ?
the truck with the guns , fucko .
fucko ?
brrr ...
he was a good guy .
crazy , though .
wanna know what your buddy fenster told us ?
who ?
mcmanus .
he told us another story altogether .
oh , that one about the hooker with dysentery .
fenster always worked with mcmanus .
he was a real tight ass ... ... but when it came to the job , he was right on .
a smart man .
what are you saying ?
i say he' il flip you .
he what ?
flip you .
flip you for real .
yeah , i' m shaking .
c' mon .
answer my question .
can you hear me in the back ?
hello ?
i want ... ... my lawyer .
i' m gonna have your fucking badge , cocksucker .
todd hockney .
good with explosives .
without a doubt , a one guy who didn' t give a fuck about anybody .
you guys don' t have a fucking leg to stand on .
you think so , tough guy ?
i could put you in queens on the night of the hijacking .
really ?
i live in queens .
did you ... put that together yourself , einstein ?
what' ve you got , a team of monkeys working around the clock on this ?
you know what happens if you do another turn in the joint ?
fuck your father in the shower and then have a snack .
you gonna charge me , dickhead ?
i' il charge you when i' m ready .
with what ?
you know damn well , dead man .
but keaton ...
keaton was the real prize for them , for obvious reasons .
it was your mistake , not mine .
did you ever stop to ask me ?
i mean , i' ve been working around with the same face , the same name .
i' m a businessman .
yeah , what' s that ?
the restaurant business ?
no , from now on , you' re in the " getting fucked by us " business .
i' m gonna make you famous , cocksucker .
like i said ... ... it was your mistake .
not mine .
now you charge me with this shit ... ... and i' il beat it .
ok ?
let' s get back to that truck , asshole .
so i did a little time ... ... does that mean i get railed every time ... ... a truck finds its way off the planet ?
fuck them !
fenster , will you relax ?
these guys don' t have any probable cause .
you' re fucking a right .
no p. c. ...
no goddamn right .
you do some time , they never let you go .
you know , treat me like a criminal ... ... i' il end up a criminal .
you are a criminal !
hey , why you gotta go and do that ?
i' m trying to make a point .
oh , why don' t you make your point .
you' re making me tired all over .
oh , fuck it then .
i heard you were dead .
oh yeah ?
well , you heard right .
the word i got is you hung up your spurs , man .
what' s that all about ?
what' s this ?
rumor has it , keaton' s gone straight .
i hear he' s tapping edie finneran .
who is that ?
she' s a heavy weight criminal lawyer from uptown .
i hear she' s keaton' s meal ticket .
how ' bout it , keaton ?
you a lawyer' s wife ?
what kind of " retainer " you giving her ?
hey , fenster .
do your friend a favor ...
tell him to keep quiet .
dean keaton ... ... gone clean , huh ?
say it ain' t so .
was it you that hit that truck ?
forget him .
you got to talk to your lawyer ?
this whole thing was a shakedown .
what makes you say that ?
how many times have you been to a line up ?
it' s always you and four dummies .
p. d. are paying homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time .
and there' s no way they' d line five felons in the same row .
no way !
and what' s a voice line up ?
a public defender could get you out of that one .
so why the hell was i strip searched ?
it was the feds .
a truckload of guns gets snagged ... ... customs comes down to n. y. p. d. looking for answers they come up with us .
they are clutching at straws .
ah , the guys fingered my asshole tonight .
is it friday already ?
yeah , lover boy .
you want a piece ?
something , i love you .
so who in the goddamn place ... ... stole the fucking truck ?
what did you say ?
who stole the fucking truck !
i don' t want to know .
who asked you , working man ?
fuck who did it .
what i want to know is who' s the gimp .
he' s ok .
says you .
how do i know that ?
what about it , pretzel man ?
what' s your story ?
his name is verbal .
verbal kint .
yeah , i was just going to tell you to shut up .
we' ve met before once or twice .
in county .
i was in for fraud .
you were in the line up then , too .
what happened ?
i walked .
ninety days , suspended .
so you did it !
all right , now look ...
we' ve all been put out by this whole thing , right ?
so i figure we owe it to ourselves to salvage a little dignity
now ... ... me and fenster heard about a little job .
why don' t you just calm down ?
why do you care what he has to say ?
i' m just talking here .
and it seems to me like mr. hockney wants to hear what i got to say ... ... and i know fenster' s down .
what about you guy ?
i' m interested , sure .
there , see ?
so now i' d like to exercise my right to free assembly .
why don' t you just shut up ?
you' re missing the point .
no ...
you' re missing the point .
i don' t want to hear anything from you .
i don' t care about your job .
and ...
i want nothing to do with any of you .
i beg your pardon ... ... but you can all go to hell .
dean keaton ... ... gone the high road .
what is the world coming to ?
fuck him .
and that was how it started .
the five of us being brought in on a trumped up charge to be leaned on by half wits .
ok , now i really can' t talk about it much here ...
what the cops never figured out , and what i know now ... ... was that these men would never break , never lie down ... ... never bend over for anybody ... ... anybody .
who are you ?
agent jack baer , fbl .
how many dead ?
15 so far .
they' re still pulling some bodies out of the water , though .
any survivors ?
yeah , there' s two .
one guy is in county hospital , but he' s in a coma .
the d. a. has the second guy ... ... a cripple from new york , i think .
listen , the chief wants this place sealed off .
if you have any questions , give him a call
this is dave kujan .
i' il be in los angeles until tuesday .
if you need to reach me , contact ... ... jeff rabin at the san pedro p. d. , at extension 112 .
have a nice day .
why can' t i see him ?
dave , i told you ... ... the d. a. came down here last night ... ... ready to arraign even before they moved him to county .
ok ?
kint' s lawer shows up five minutes later ... ... d. a. comes out of the office looking like the boogey man smacked him around .
allright ?
they take the statement and they cut him a deal .
what ?
did they charge him with anything ?
yeah , weapons .
misdemeanor two .
what is that ?
listen , i give the d. a. credit for getting that much , you understand ?
excuse me .
this whole thing has turned political .
the major was here last night .
the chief .
this morning ... ... the governor called , ok ?
i' m telling you this guy is protected from up on high by the prince of darkness .
take my word for it .
when does he post bail ?
maybe two hours , tops .
i want to see him .
no , dave .
i gotta see him , jeffrey .
dave , no !
i can not do this for you .
i came a long way for this .
dave , please .
even if i let you talk to him , he won' t talk to you .
he' s paranoid about being recorded .
he knows the interrogation rooms are wired .
this won' t be an interrogation ... ... just a friendly chat to kill some time .
he will not go into the interrogation room .
just someplace else , then .
where ?
if this was a dope deal , where' s the dope ?
if it was a hit , who called it in ?
i' m sure you have a host of wild theories to answer all these questions .
you know damn well what i think .
that' s crazy .
and besides , it doesn' t even matter ... ... the guy' s got total immunity .
his story checks out .
he doesn' t know what you want to know .
i don' t think he does .
not exactly .
but there' s a lot more to his story , believe me .
jeffrey , look ...
i want to know why 27 men died on that pier ... ... for what looks to be 91 million dollars worth of dope that wasn' t there .
and above all ... ... i want to be sure dean keaton is dead .
he' s dead .
c' mon , two hours .
just ' till he makes bail .
they' re all dead .
i don' t care how tough a guy you say this keaton was ... ... nobody on that boat could have come out alive .
is he talking ?
he regained consciousness less than an hour ago ... ... he spoke , not english ... then he lapsed .
hungarian ?
i don' t know .
i think that may have been what it was .
yeah , most of them were hungarians .
you' ve got to put on these .
burn victims are very succeptible to infections .
and , of course , there is no smoking .
keep your mask up .
please don' t touch him .
is he gonna die ?
he has burns over 60 % of his body , a number of his ribs are broken
call hospital security .
get a man .
put him on the door until the police get here .
is he dangerous ?
yes !
do it !
do it now !
joel ?
yeah , baer , down at l. a. county .
look , the guy they pulled out of the harbor is arkosh kovash .
yes !
yes , i' m sure .
no , no , he' s all fucked up .
what ?
i can' t hear you .
shut up !
i' m on the phone !
yes .
well , no .
not
just send me someone who can speak hungarian .
yeah !
he' s awake and talking like a thai hooker .
no , just somebody who
what ?
no shit !
joel .
yeah , call dan metzheiser over at justice ... ... and find dave kujan from customs .
verbal , this is agent kujan , from customs .
nice to meet you .
he wants to ask you a few questions before you go .
what about ?
about dean keaton mostly .
but i' d like to start at the line up back in new york .
can i get some coffee ?
i a while .
let' s talk about the line up .
i' m really thirsty .
i used to dehydrate as a kid .
one time i got so bad , my piss came out like snot ... ... i' m not kidding
i' il get your fucking coffee .
get me one too while you' re at it .
that guy is tense .
tension is a killer .
i used to be in a barber shop quartet in skokie , illinois ... ... the bariton was this guy named kip diskin .
big , fat guy .
i mean , like orca fat .
he was so stressed in the morning
verbal , you know we' re trying to help you .
sure .
and i appreciate that .
and i want to help you , agent kujan .
i like cops .
i would have liked to be a fed myself , but my c. p. always
verbal , you' re not telling us everything .
i know you know something .
i told the d. a. everything i know .
verbal ... ... i know you like keaton .
i know you think he' s a good man .
i know he was good .
he was a corrupt cop .
sure , 15 years ago .
but he was a good thief .
anyway , the cops wouldn' t let him go legit .
dean keaton was a piece of shit .
are you trying to get a rise out of me , agent kujan ?
i just want to hear your story .
it' s all there .
may i have a cigarette ?
according to your statement  i need a light .
according to your statement , you' re a short con operator .
according to your statement , you' re a short con operator .
run of the mill scams .
that' s been suppressed .
anything in there is inadmissible .
oh , i know .
sweet deal you have here .
total immunity .
well , i do have the weapons charge .
i' m looking at six whole months hard time .
you know a dealer named ruby deemer , verbal ?
you know a religious guy named john paul ?
you know ruby is in attica ?
he didn' t have my lawyer .
i know ruby .
he' s big on respect .
he' s good friend of mine .
likes me very much .
now , i know your testimony is sealed .
ruby' s well connected .
he' s got a lot of friends inside ... ... do a lot of favors for him .
what do you think he would say if he found out you dropped his name to the d. a. ?
there' s nothing in there about ruby .
i' il be sure to mention that to him .
first thing on the job , you know what i learned ?
how to spot a murderer .
let' s say you arrest 3 guys ... ... for the same killing .
you put them all in jail overnight .
the next morning , whoever is sleeping is your man .
you see , if you' re guilty and you know you' re caught , you get some rest ... ... you let your guard down .
you follow me ?
no .
let me get right to the point .
i' m smarter than you .
and i' m gonna find out what i wanna know .
and i' m gonna get it from you wether you like it or not .
i' m not a rat .
thanks .
back when i was picking beans in guatemala , we used to make fresh coffee .
right off the trees , i mean .
that was good .
this is shit .
but , hey , i' m in a police station
can we get started again ?
now , what happened after the line up ?
... the desk sergeant is actually trying to tell me that they he couldn' t release you .
can you believe that ?
you weren' t even charged !
new york police !
you know , i want to have pictures taken of your face ... ... take them to the d. a. ' s office first thing tomorrow morning .
just forget about it .
absolutely not !
i' m gonna have this thing in front of the grand jury by monday .
look , i don' t want to talk about it , edie .
ok ?
so what did fortier and renault say ?
they asked for some more time to think about the restaurant .
they just want more time !
it' s ok ...
more time for what , edie ?
no matter how you cover my tracks , they' re still going to find out about me .
give me some credit .
i got you this far .
let' s go to the grand jury .
you know , this isn' t going to stop if we
it' s never going to stop .
period .
by next week , every investor in this city is going to be walking away from us .
it' s finished .
i' m finished .
don' t give up on me now , dean .
it' s never going to stop .
i love you .
they ruined me in there tonight .
i love you .
do you hear me ?
what ?
all right .
let' s just go to my place .
we' il worry about this tomorrow .
fenster and mcmanus had a cagey proposition .
a fast jump .
high risk .
long money .
we all knew it could be done .
the way i figured , to do it wrong meant killing .
to do it right took five men .
five men meant keaton .
keaton took convincing .
new york finest taxi service .
bullshit !
they don' t operate anymore .
mcmanus has a friend in the 14th precinct .
they' re coming out for one job thursday .
they are picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of south america .
mcmanus already has a fence set to take the stuff .
a fence ?
who ?
some guy in california .
his name is redfoot .
i never heard of him .
you have to come .
what' s it to you wether i do it not ?
they they don' t know me .
you do .
they won' t take me unless you go .
look at me .
i need this .
oh , are you telling me you don' t need this ?
is this your place ?
i' m not knocking you , you look like you' ve got a good little scam going on with this lawyer
sorry .
it' s ok .
you say it' s the real thing ?
that' s cool .
you' re ok ?
i was out of line .
but they' re never going to stop with us , you know that .
as clean as you could ever get , they' il never let you go now .
this way we hit the cops where it hurts and we get well in the mean time .
you sure you' re ok ?
i' il be all right .
look , i ...
... sometimes get  forget it .
i probably shit blood tonight .
so , how do they want to do it ?
mcmanus wants to go in shooting .
i say no .
fenster ?
hockney ?
they' re pretty pissed off .
they' il do anything .
now , i' ve got a way of doing it without killing anyone .
but , as i said , they won' t let me in without you .
three million ?
maybe more .
no killing .
not if we do it my way .
new york' s finest taxi service was not your normal taxi service .
it was a ring of corrupt cops in the n. y. p. d. that ran a high profit racket ... ... driving smugglers and drug dealers all over the city .
for a few hundred dollars a mile , you got your own blue and white ... ... and a police escort .
they even had their own business cards .
after a while , somebody started asking ... ... questions and the taxi service shut down .
ever since then , internal affairs had been waiting to catch them in the act .
and that' s where we came in .
so , how was the flight ?
fucking great .
will this get me to staten island ?
kidding me ?
this will get you to cape cod .
mcmanus came to us with the job , fenster got the vans ... ... hockney supplied the hardware .
i came through with how to do it so no one got killed .
but keaton ...
keaton put on the finishing touch .
a little " fuck you " from the five of us to the n. y. p. d. .
all right , watch this .
careful !
asshole !
don' t move , you fucker !
who the  drop it !
now , motherfucker !
drop the fucking gun !
don' t you fucking touch those fucking things !
what the fuck d' you guys want ?
stupid asshole !
watch it !
you want a buckshot shampoo , chubby ?
afternoon , my little pork chops .
now gimme the shit .
give him the fucking shit !
give him the fucking shit !
hurry up !
c' mon !
now the money !
there' s no money !
gimme the money !
right now !
there' s no fucking money !
give him the money !
the money !
give me the fucking money !
do it !
give him the money !
hurry up !
do you peolpe know who the fuck i am ?
we do now , jerk off .
what' s that ?
what the fuck ?
holy shit !
keaton made an anonymous phone call ... ... the press was on the scene before the police were .
strausz and rizzi were indicted three days later .
within a few weeks , 50 more cops went down with them .
everybody got it right in the ass , from the chief on down .
it was beautiful .
i owe you $2 . 50 .
there' s more here than i thought .
when does the fence come ?
redfoot never comes to see me , i always go to see him .
in california ?
yes , verbal , in california .
fenster and i will
wait , wait ...
hold the fucking phone ... ... you and fenster ?
no , no , no ...
you fuckin ' kiddin ' me ?
ok .
so ... ... who' s gonna go ?
we all go !
what' s your fucking problem , man ?
my fucking problem , man , is that you and fenster are off honeymooning in california ... ... while the rest of us are sitting here holding our dicks .
hey !
the job' s over .
cool it .
l. a. is a good place to lay low for a while .
wanna dance ?
ladies ...
i would like to propose a toast ...
there you go .
... to mr. verbal ... ... the man with the plan .
we' re gonna miss the flight .
don' t do this .
send her a note something .
i said we' il make it .
we' re gonna miss the plane .
she' il understand .
that' s heartwarming .
really .
i' m weepy .
jeff , you wanna wait outside ?
you guys wanted to know what happened after the line up .
i' m telling you .
come on , verbal .
who do you think you' re talking to ?
you expect me to believe that he retired ?
for a woman ?
bullshit !
keaton was using her .
he loved her .
sure .
i' m supposed to believe that hitting the taxi service wasn' t his idea either ?
it was all fenster and mcmanus .
c' mon , keaton was a cop for 4 years !
who else would know the taxi service better ?
that job had his name written all over it .
but edie had him all turned around .
let me tell you something .
i know dean keaton .
i' ve been investigating him for the past 3 years .
the guy i know was a cold blooded bastard .
i. a. d. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force .
so don' t sell me the hooker with the heart of gold .
you got him all wrong .
do i ?
dean keaton was under indictment a total of 7 times while he was on the force .
in every case the witnesses either reversed their testimony to the grand jury ... ... or died before they could testify .
when they finally nailed him for fraud he spent five years in sing sing .
he killed three prisioners inside .
of course i can' t prove this .
dean keaton was dead .
did you know that ?
he died in a fire two years ago ... ... during an investigation into the murder of a witness ... ... who was going to testify against him .
two people saw dean keaton walk into a warehouse he owned ... ... just before it blew up .
they said he went in to check a leaking gas main .
it blew up , and took all of dean keaton with it .
within three months of the explosion ... ... the two witnesses , they were dead .
one killed himself in his car ... ... the other fell down an open elevator shaft .
agent baer .
this is not what we discussed .
there are far too many people in this room
look , doctor , i promise we' il be out of here before he blows his porcelain .
ok ?
i have a noon meeting , baer .
agent baer , five minutes .
look , everyone just calm down .
all right ?
i want you to ask this man about the shoot out in the harbor .
he says they were buying
dope , we know .
he doesn' t know what they were buying , but not dope ... people .
what ?
he needs guarantees ...
what is he talking about ?
he says his life' s in danger .
he saw the devil .
looked him in the eye .
i' m on my way .
no , no .
wait a minute .
ask him to tell him what he told me .
about the devil .
who' s the devil .
keyser soze .
he was in the harbor ... ... killing many men .
he saw keyser soze ?
he saw his face .
tell him to tell her what he looks like .
describe him .
six weeks ago i get an anonymous phone call telling me ... ... i could find keaton eating at mondino' s with his attourney .
and there he is .
now , because he never profited from his alleged death ... ... and because we convicted someone else of the murder we tried to pin on him ... ... we had to let him go .
he was dead just long enough for the murder rap to blow over .
and then he had lunch .
i don' t know about that .
oh , i don' t think you do .
but you say you saw keaton die .
i think you' re covering his ass ... ... and he' s still out there somewhere .
i think he' s behind that whole circus at the harbor .
my bet is he' s using you because your' re stupid and you think he' s your friend .
you tell me he' s dead ?
so be it .
i want to be sure he' s dead before i go back to new york .
he wasn' t behind anything .
it was the lawyer .
what lawyer .
what lawyer , verbal ?
you know , back when i was with that barber shop quartet in skokie , illinois , i
you don' t think i know you held out on the d. a. ?
what did you leave out on that testimony ?
i can be on the phone to ruby deemer in ten minutes .
the d. a. gave me immunity .
nos from me .
you get no immunity from me , you piece of shit .
every criminal i have put in prison , every cop that owes me a favor ... ... every creeping scumbag that works the street for a living will know the name of verbal kint .
now you talk to me ... ... or that precious immunity they seem so fit to grant you ... ... won' t be worth the paper the contract put out on your life is printed on .
there was a lawyer .
kobayashi .
is he the one that killed keaton ?
no .
but i' m sure keaton is dead .
convince me .
tell me every last detail .
we arrived in los angeles and met mcmanus ' friends , redfoot .
he had a good reputation .
seemed like a good guy .
still , we should have known better .
how' re you doing ?
good .
you ?
not bad .
how' s it going , fenster ?
no need to open it , right ?
you must be keaton .
redfoot , dean keaton .
todd hockney and verbal kint .
verbal .
the man with the plan , huh ?
you guys interested in any more work ?
we' re always looking for extra work .
we' re on vacation .
oh well ... that' s too bad .
i have a ton of work and i don' t have any good people .
not like you guys .
what' s the job .
there' s this jeweler out of texas named saul .
he rents a suite in some downtown hotel ... ... does free appraisals for people .
sometimes he buys , sometimes he doesn' t .
anyway , the word is he carries around a lot of cash .
so i figure , i keep the merchandise , you keep the green .
it' s simple .
what about security ?
a couple of bodyguards .
nothing you couldn' t handle .
give me time to check it out .
i' d expect nothing less from you , man .
good to see you .
we' il call you .
good to see you too .
enjoy l. a. , huh ?
get yourself laid .
a friend of mine in new york tells me that you know spook hollis .
the way i hear it ... ... you did time with old spook .
good man , wasn' t he ?
i used to run dope for him .
too bad he got shivved .
yeah .
i shivved him .
better you hear it from me now than somebody else later .
i appreciate that .
just out of curiosity ... ... was it business or personal ?
a bit of both .
well , like i said , you give me a call if you' re interested .
is there a problem ?
one job .
that was the deal .
one job ?
one job !
that' s a good one , keaton .
keaton followed the best he could , but a man can' t change what he is .
he can convince anyone he' s someone else , but never himself .
it took one day with mcmanus nagging and we went back to work .
give me the case !
give me the fucking case !
give me the fucking case !
i' m telling you for the last time ... ... give me the fucking case !
now just hand over the case .
hand over the fucking case !
bad day .
fuck it .
looks like a lot of china to me .
shit .
guys , c' mon .
what are you doing ?
what does it look that i' m doing .
i' m gonna kill him .
look , we did it your way .
now we' re gonna do it my way .
are you gonna kill him ?
i' m going to deal with him .
you better deal with him
shut up .
what i am supposed to do with that ?
i don' t know .
feed it to the gimp .
eases pain .
i don' t know what that is .
what do you mean you don ' know ?
shut up .
i don' t know .
i got thrown this job by some lawyer .
yeah , who ?
i don' t know .
some limey .
he' s a middle man for somebody .
he doesn' t say .
i don' t ask .
you' re fucking full of shit .
fuck you !
listen to me .
we want to meet him , ok ?
that' s funny .
called me last night ... ... he says he wants to meet you guys .
ok .
we' il meet him .
i' il call you .
good .
do that .
no problem .
i don' t like the deal .
one more thing , tough guy .
any more surprises , and i' m gonna kill you .
you' re such a top guy mcmanus .
but do me a favor , right ?
get the fuck off my dick !
put a leash on that puppy .
it' s an awful shame about saul getting waxed .
cops are gonna be looking for the guys who did it .
sooner or later they' re gonna come ' round asking me .
you have a sweet night , ladies .
so this lawyer ...
kobayashi . ... came from redfoot .
right .
and why leave this out when you talked to the d. a. ?
dave .
someone to see you .
jack .
i' ve been looking all over for you .
you still after that coke that took a walk out of that blood bath in the harbor yesterday ?
yeah .
well , you can stop looking .
it was no coke .
i' ve been in l. a. county talking to a guy they pulled out ... ... of a drainpipe in san pedro yesterday after the shoot out .
he came to this morning .
he started talking .
he was part of a hungarian mob there to do a deal with a bunch of goats from argentina ... ... and he says it was definitely not a dope deal .
but the 91 mill  yeah , we know .
our man says no way on the dope .
this hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for turkey the next day .
they had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it .
what' s the money for ?
he didn' t know .
no one doing the deal knew , except for a few key people .
they all were very hush about it , he says .
whatever it was , it' s very sensitive .
i don' t get it .
they tell me you got that cripple there from new york .
did he mention keyser soze ?
who ?
just bear with me here .
who' s keyser soze ?
oh , fuck !
we' ve been going over this for an hour and a half .
what we need to do is find redfoot and get the hell out of here now .
what we need to do is think .
think back .
somebody ... ... with power .
somebody who was capable of tracking us from new york to los angeles .
come on , dean .
what the hell are we doing here ?
we' re waiting .
bye now .
sit down .
no , i' m fucking bored
mr. hockney , do stay .
mr. keaton ... ... mr. fenster i recognize from his mug shots , as well as mr. mcmanus .
i can only assume that you are mr. kint , the gentleman who disposed of saul berg .
my employer sends his gratitude .
a most unexpected benefit .
i am mr. kobayashi .
i have been asked by my employer to bring a proposal ... ... to you gentlemen .
what do you want ?
my employer requires your services gentlemen .
one job .
one day' s work .
very dangerous .
he does not expect all of you to live .
but those of you who do ... ... will have 91 million dollars to divide between you ...
... in any way you see fit .
who' s your boss ?
i work for keyser soze .
who' s keyser soze ?
judging by the sudden change in mood , mr. kint ... ... i feel sure the rest of your associates can tell you .
i come with an offer directly from mr. soze .
an order , actually .
what do you mean , an order ?
in 1981 , mr. keaton , ... ... you participated in the hijacking of a truck in buffalo , new york .
the cargo was raw steel .
steel which belonged to mr. soze ... ... and which was destined for pakistan , to be used in a nuclear reactor .
a most profitable violation of u. n. regulations .
you had no way of knowing this , mr. keaton ... ... because the fellow shipping the steel was working for mr. soze ... ... without his knowledge .
earlier this year ... ... mr. fenster and mr. mcmanus hijacked a two prop cargo flight out of newark airport .
the plane was carrying gold and platinum wiring .
also set for pakistan .
two months ago , mr. hockney stole a truck carrying gun parts ... ... through queens ... ... gun parts which where set to be destroyed by the state of new york .
they would be " lost " in a weigh station and rerouted to belfast .
again , mr. soze , using pawns who had no knowledge .
which brings us to mr. kint .
nine months ago ... ... one of mr. soze' s less than intelligent couriers ... ... was taken in a complicated confidence scan ... by a cripple .
he was relieved of 62, 000 dollars .
now , it has taken us some time to find you .
our intention was to approach you after your apprehension in new york .
you set up the line up ...
yes .
you were not to be released until i had come to see you .
it seems mr. keatons attourney , ms. finneran ... ... was a little too effective in expediting his release .
holding the rest of you became a moot point .
what about redfoot ?
mr. redfoot knew nothing .
mr. soze rarely works with the same people ... ... for very long , and they never know who they' re working for .
one cannot be betrayed if one has no people .
so ... why telling us ?
because you have stolen from mr. soze , mr. fenster .
all of you .
that you did not know you stole from him ... ... is the only reason you' re still alive .
he feels you owe him .
you will repay your debt .
all right , fuck the debt !
and fuck you !
how do we know you work for soze ?
i don' t think that is very relevant , mr. hockney .
all five of you are responsible for the murder of saul berg and his bodyguards .
mr. redfoot can testify to your involvement , and we can see to it that he will .
what' s your point ?
the offer is this , gentlemen .
mr. soze' s primary interest ... ... is narcotics .
he has been " competing " , shall we say , with a group of argentinians ... ... for several years now .
competing with mr. soze has taken its toll .
these argentinians are negotiating the sale ... ... of 91 million dollars in cocaine in 3 days time .
needless to say , this purchase will revitalize ... ... the diminishing strength of their organization .
mr. soze would like you to stop the deal .
if you choose , you may wait until after the buy .
whatever money changes hands is yours .
mr. soze would like you to get to the boat and destroy the cocaine onboard .
and then you will be free of your obligations to mr. soze .
you give me one good reason why i shouldn' t kill you right now .
a gift ... ... from mr. soze .
good day , gentlemen .
they' ve got my whole life in here !
everything i' ve ever done since i was 18 !
they fucking know everything !
everybody i' ve ever worked with or did time with .
no ... this isn' t right .
i don' t know .
who was that guy who used to talk about soze in new york ?
bricks marlin .
yeah , he did jobs for him .
indirect stuff .
he said he always made 5 times more money than the job was worth .
this guy' s a pipe dream .
kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
i don' t know .
this is bad .
that' s bullshit !
this guy could be l. a. p. d. ...
it' s a fucking setup !
ah , the way i hear it , soze ... is some kind of butcher .
a fearless psycho ... fucked up butcher .
there is no keyser soze !
who is keyser soze ?
he' s supposed to be turkish .
some say his father was german .
nobody ever believed he was real .
nobody ever knew him or saw anybody that ever worked directly for him ... ... but to hear kobayashi tell it , anybody could have worked for soze .
you never knew .
that was his power .
the greatest trick the devil ever pulled ... ... was convincing the world he didn' t exist .
one story the guys told me the story i believe ... ... was from his days in turkey .
there was a gang of hungarians that wanted their own mob .
they realized that to be in power ... ... you didn' t need guns , or money , or even numbers .
you just needed the will to do what the other guy wouldn' t .
after a while , they come into power and then they come after soze .
he was small time then , just running dope they say .
they come to his home ... ... in the afternoon ... ... looking for his business .
they find his wife and kids in the house ... ... and decide to wait for soze .
he comes home ... ... to find his wife raped and children screaming .
the hungarians knew soze was tough .
not to be trifled with .
so they let him know they meant business .
they tell him they want his territory .
all of his business .
soze looks over the faces of his family ... ... then he showed these men of will what will really was .
he tells him he would rather see his family dead ... ... than live another day after this .
he lets the last hungarian go .
he waits until his wife and kids are in the ground and then he goes after the rest of the mob .
he kills their kids .
he kills their wives .
he kills their parents ... ... and their parents friends .
he burns down the houses they live in ... ... and the stores they work in .
he kills people that owe them money .
and like that ... ... he' s gone .
underground .
nobody has ever seen him since .
he becomes a myth .
a spook story that criminals tell their kids at night .
rat on your pop and keyser soze will get you .
no one ever really believes .
do you believe in him , verbal ?
i don' t believe in god , but i' m afraid of him .
well , i believe in god .
and the only thing that scares me is keyser soze .
you give any weight to this ?
i can introduce you to dan metzheiser from justice .
he' s got a file on soze in d. c. .
i' ts been a hobby of his for a couple of years .
a lot of guys equate him to that reporter on the incredible hulk .
you' ve heard of him ?
what , on the street ?
a few times .
outside stuff .
somebody working for a guy who works for a guy ... ... who got some money from keyser soze .
y' know , shit like that .
could be an old badge .
a hex sign to keep people from fucking with you ... ... back when a name was to mean something .
but you' re here .
shit , yeah .
i got a guy trying to walk out of the hospital on a fried drumstick ... ... because he' s afraid of soze .
i' il run up the flagpole .
i came clean .
i told it like it happened on the boat .
so what if i left out how i got there ?
it' s so full of holes , the d. a. would have told me to blow amnesty up my ass .
so you got what you wanted out of me , so big fucking deal .
so that' s why you never told the d. a. .
well , you tell me , agent kujan ... if i told you the loch ness monster ... hired me to hit the harbor , what would you say ?
turn state' s evidence .
we' il put you on the stand , we' il hear it out .
i' ve got immunity now .
what can you possibly offer me ?
if there really is a keyser soze , he' s gonna come looking for you .
where' s your head , agent kujan ?
where do you think the pressure' s coming from ?
keyser soze , or whatever you want to call him ... ... he knows where i am right now .
he' s got the front burner under your ass to let me go ... ... so he can scoop me up 10 minutes later .
immunity was just a deal with you assholes .
i' ve got a whole new problem when i post bail .
so why play into his hands ?
we can protect you .
oh , gee , thanks dave .
bang up job so far ... ... extortion , coersion ... ... you probably pardon me if i ask you to kiss my pucker .
the same fuckers that rounded this up and sank us into this mess ... ... are now bailing me out ?
fuck you !
you think you can catch keyser soze ?
you think a guy like that comes this close to getting caught ... ... and sticks his head out ?
if he comes up for anything , it will be to get rid of me .
and after that ... ... my guess is you' il never hear from him again .
what happened next ?
we woke up next morning and fenster was gone .
he couldn' t handle the idea of slumming for soze .
he left us a note wishing us good luck ... ... and took a chunk of the money we' d scraped together .
then what ?
mcmanus was furious .
he was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out ... ... and all sorts of shit .
that night we got the call .
what call ?
kobayashi told us where we could find fenster .
all right , let' s get the fuck out of here .
we' ve got to bury him .
with what ?
with our hands .
oh , this is nuts !
it' s dry fucking sand , mcmanus .
when he rots ... ... the surfers are gonna smell him a mile away .
dig , you fucker !
hey , what are we going to do ?
this fucking guy is gonna kill us .
i don' t know you , peg leg , but i can run .
i got no problem with that .
kobayashi doesn' t seem to have a problem with that either .
you run ?
i won' t be digging a hole for you .
you got that ?
this ain' t my boy we' re burying .
i don' t owe anybody !
fuck you !
he was my partner for 5 years .
we did more jobs , and i saw more money , than you can ever count .
so fuck you !
' cause now it' s payback !
it' s not payback .
it' s precaution .
you want payback ?
you wanna run ?
i don' t care .
i' m not doing this for fenster .
i' m not doing it for you .
i' m doing this for me .
i' m going to finish this thing .
this kobayashi bastard is not going to stand on me .
and after they killed fenster , nobody would run ?
i wanted to .
i thought we could make it .
why didn' t you say anything ?
believe me , i tried .
but keaton wouldn' t have it .
it was too far fetched for him .
keaton was a grounded guy , an ex cop .
to a cop the explanation is never that complicated .
it' s always simple .
there' s no mistery to the street , no arch criminal behind it all .
if you got a dead body and you think his brother did it ... ... you' re going to find out you' re right .
nobody argued with keaton .
they just set their minds to whacking kobayashi .
they' re coming up .
you hear me ?
he' s coming up .
he' s on his way down .
don' t move .
press twenty .
do it now .
move .
the answer is no .
mr. soze will be most up
listen , you cocksucker , there is no keyser soze .
you mention his name again , i' il kill you right now .
strange threat , mr. keaton .
i can only assume you' ve come here to kill me anyway .
we know that you can get to us .
but now you know that we can get to you .
i' m giving you one last chance to call this off .
mr. so
my employer has made up his mind .
he does not change it .
neither do we .
you got fenster .
but you won' t get all of us .
not before one of us gets through to you .
i believe you , mr. mcmanus .
i most sincerely do .
you would not have been chosen were you not so suitable .
but i cannot make this decision .
whatever you threaten me with is ... ludicrous ... ... in comparsion to what will be done to me if i do not carry out my orders in full .
i' m the guy that' s going to get you .
i just wanted you to know that .
i' m so sorry , mr. mcmanus .
i implore you , mr. keaton , believe me .
mr. soze is very real and very determined .
we' il see .
before you ... ... do me in , mr. mcmanus ... ... you' il let me finish my business ... ... with ms. finneran first , won' t you ?
what did you say ?
edie finneran .
she' s upstairs in my office .
for an extradition deposition .
i requested she be put on the case personally .
she flew in yesterday .
no matter .
kill away , mr. mcmanus .
you' re lying .
am i ?
ms. finneran' s escort while she' s here in los angeles .
never leaves her side for a moment .
i thought you' d be glad to know she' s in good hands .
now get some rest .
the boat will be ready for you on friday .
if i see you or any of your friends before then ...
ms. finneran will find herself the victim ... ... of a most gruesome violation before she dies .
as , indeed , your father , mr. hockney ... ... and your uncle randall in arizona , mr. kint .
i might only castrate ... ... mr. mcmanus ' nephew , david .
do i make myself clear ?
we will take care of the two bodies downstairs .
we' il add them to the cost of mr. fenster .
now if you' il excuse me , gentlemen .
geez .
it' s a logistical nightmare .
close quarters .
ten , maybe twenty men .
there' s no telling how many more are gonna be below deck .
can we stealth these guys ?
no .
with all that coke , they are going to be ready .
which brings me to sunny point number two .
even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat , we still get nothing .
what if we wait for the money ?
ten more men at least .
look , in my opinion it can' t be done .
anybody who goes in there is not coming out alive .
i' m gonna wait for the money .
me too .
did you hear what he just said ?
if i' m going in , i want a cut .
me too .
there' s nothing that can' t be done .
i just can' t believe we' re just gonna walk into certain death .
news said it' s raining in new york .
what language is that ?
i don' t know .
russian , i think .
hungarian ?
package has arrived .
you kids are ready ?
i would be if i wouldn' t have to stop and answer you .
i' m ready .
mcmanus , you better be set up in ten seconds .
i' m ready .
i want you to stay here .
but i' m supposed to cover
listen , if we don' t get out of this i want you to take the money and go .
find edie , tell her what happened .
tell her everything .
she knows people .
she knows what to do .
if i don' t get kobayashi my way , she' il get him her way .
just do what i say .
please .
tell her that ...
tell her i tried .
mcmanus .
he' s on his way .
i' m there .
huh .
oswald was a fag .
hi .
how are you doing ?
is there ... a problem ?
now ...
old mcdonald ... ... had a farm ... ... ee aye , ee aye , oh .
and on that farm he shot some guys ... ... ba da boom , ba da bing , bang boom .
elvis has left the building .
why didn' t you run ?
i froze up .
i thought about fenster and how he looked when we buried him .
and i thought about keaton .
it looked like he might pull it off .
a boy came across a body on the beach this morning .
thrown clear when the boat burned ... ... shot twice in the head .
two guys from the bureau just identified him .
what else ?
his name was arturo marquez , a petty smuggler from argentina .
he was arrested last year in new york for trafficking .
he escaped to california .
they picked him up in long beach ... ... they' re setting up extradition he escapes again .
now , get this ...
edie finneran is brought in to advice in the proceedings .
kobayashi .
new york faxed me a copy of his testimony .
he was a rat .
a big fucking rat .
arturo was very opposed to returning to prison .
so much so that he named close to 50 people .
guess who he named in finale ?
keyser soze .
there' s more .
i' il tell you what i know .
stop me when this sounds familiar .
there was no dope on that boat .
stay quiet !
he' s here !
i know he' s here !
that' s him !
i' m telling you that' s him !
i know he' s here !
you don' t understand .
that' s him ...
shut up !
that' s him , you hear me ?
i' m telling you it' s keyser soze !
where' s hockney ?
i don' t know .
there' s no coke !
what ?
you heard me , you dumb fuck .
there' s no coke !
i checked the entire ship !
i' ve been in every fucking room !
there' s gotta be coke !
there is nothing !
nothing !
you' re fucking me !
there is ... no ... fucking ... coke !
i' m outta here .
i told them nothing .
i swear .
i told them nothing .
please !
mcmanus ?
what the fuck is going on ?
strangest thing ...
a man in a suit with a slim build .
wait a minute .
i don' t have a minute .
are you saying you saw keyser soze ?
you told the d. a. you didn' t know who it was !
i know there was dope on that boat .
stop stalling , verbal !
i' m not stalling !
you know what i' m getting at .
get out of my face .
i' ve got immunity , i don' t have to take that shit .
you know ... what i' m getting at , verbal .
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
yes you do ... the truth !
try to tell me you saw someone kill keaton .
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
i did !
you' re lying to me !
you know .
you' ve known this whole fucking time !
i don' t know what you' re saying .
i did see keaton get shot , i swear to you .
then why didn' t you help him ?
you had a gun !
why didn' t you help him ?
he was your friend !
because i was afraid .
ok ?
afraid !
afraid of what ?
i know it was keyser soze !
it was keyser soze .
i mean , agent kujan , the devil himself .
how do you shoot the devil in the back ?
what if you miss ?
all right .
let' s get back to the pier .
arturo marquez .
ever hear of him ?
what ?
no .
he was a stool pigeon for the justice department .
he swore out a statement to federal marshals saying that he had seen ... ... and could positively identify one keyser soze .
it says right here in the report .
he had intimate knowledge of his businesses ... ... including , but not exclusive to ... ... drug trafficking and murder .
i never heard of him .
his own people were selling him ... ... to a gang of hungarians .
most likely the same hungarians that soze all but wiped out back in turkey .
the money wasn' t there for dope .
the hungarians were going to buy the one guy ... ... that could incriminate keyser soze .
i said i never heard of him .
but keaton did .
edie finneran was ... ... marquez ' extradition advisor .
she knew who he was and what he knew .
i don' t und  there were no drugs on that boat .
it was a hit .
a suicide mission to whack out the one guy ... ... that could finger keyser soze .
so soze put some thiefs to it .
men he knew he could march into certain death .
you say soze sent us to kill someone ?
i' m saying keaton did .
verbal , he left you behind for a reason .
just do what i tell you .
if you all knew that soze could find you anywhere ... ... why did he give you the money to run ?
he could have used you on the boat .
he wanted me to live .
a one time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world ... ... finds it that it' s hard to save ... ... a worthless rat cripple
no , sir !
why ?
edie !
i don' t buy that reform story for a minute !
even if i did , i certainly don' t believe ... ... he would send you to protect her .
so why ?
because he was my friend !
no , verbal .
he wasn' t your friend .
keaton didn' t have friends !
what are you doing here ?
he saved you ... ... because he wanted it that way !
it was his will .
keaton was keyser soze !
no !
the kind of man who could wrangle the wills of men ... ... like hockney and mcmanus .
the kind of man ... ... who could engineer a police line up ... ... from all his years of contacts in n. y. p. d. .
the kind of man that could have killed edie finneran !
she was found yesterday at a hotel in pennsylvania .
shot twice in the head .
what do you think about keaton now , verbal ?
edie ...
he used all of you ... ... to get him on that boat .
he couldn' t get on alone ... ... he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man .
the one man that could identify him .
this is all bullshit ...
you said you saw him die ?
or did you ?
you had to hide when you first heard the police cars .
you said you heard the shot before the fire .
but you didn' t see him die .
i knew him .
he would never
he programmed you !
he programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to !
he knew we were close , you said it yourself .
where was the political pressure coming from ?
why were you being protected ?
it was keaton !
immunity was your reward !
why me ?
why not fenster or mcmanus or hockney ?
why me ?
i' m stupid , i' m a cripple !
why me ?
because you' re a cripple , verbal .
because you' re stupid .
because you' re weaker than them .
if he' s dead ... ... if what you say is true , then it won' t matter .
it was his idea to hit the taxi service in new york , wasn' t it ?
come on , tell me the truth .
it was all keaton !
we followed him from the beginning .
i didn' t know .
i saw him die .
i believe he' s dead .
oh , christ !
you' re not safe on your own .
you think he' s
keyser soze ?
i don' t know , verbal .
keyser soze is a shield .
like you said , a spook story .
but i know keaton .
and someone is out there pulling strings for you .
stay here and let us protect you .
no way .
i' m not bait .
i post today .
you posted 20 minutes ago .
capt. leo wants you out of here a. s. a. p. ...
... unless you turn state' s .
i' il take my chances , thank you .
if someone wants to get you ... they' re gonna get you out there .
turn states evidence .
you might never see trial .
may be so .
but i' m not a rat , agent kujan .
fucking cops .
excuse me .
can i use your fax machine ?
you have to sign for these .
one watch , gold .
one cigarette lighter , gold .
and a pack of cigarettes .
thank you .
you still got nothing , dave .
i know what i wanted to know about keaton .
just nothing .
no matter .
he' il have to know how close we came .
keyser soze or no keyser soze ... ... if keaton is alive , he' s not coming up again .
i' il find him .
waste of time .
a rumor is not a rumor that doesn' t die .
what ?
nothing .
man , you' re a slob .
yeah , but all has a system , dave .
it all makes sense when you look at it right .
you' ve got to stand back from it , you know ?
you want to see a real horror show ?
you should see my garage .
convince me .
and tell me every last detail ...
you know , back when i was in that barber shop quartet in skokie , illinois ...
where' s your head , agent kujan ?
what we need to do is think .
think back .
i' m sure you' ve heard many tall tales ...
bricks marlin .
this isn' t right .
i just want to hear your story .
tell me every last detail .
it' s all there .
and i' m telling it all straight , i swear .
some guy in california .
his name is redfoot .
a gift ...
... from mr. soze .
talk to me , verbal .
what about redfoot ?
mr. redfoot knew nothing . ... using pawns ...
big , fat guy .
i mean , like orca fat .
back when i was picking beans in guatemala , we used to make fresh coffee ... ... he was a good man ...
i know he was good .
tell me every last detail .
strangest thing .
how do you shoot the devil in the back ? ... this guy is protected from up on high ... ... by the prince of darkness .
what about it , pretzel man ?
what' s your story .
there was a lawyer ...
what lawyer , verbal ?
i am mr. kobayashi .
tell me every last detail .
i work for keyser soze .
convince me .
every creeping scumbag that works the street for a living will know the name of verbal kint .
the cripple !
did you see him ?
the cripple !
which way did he go ?
oh , he went out that way .
i know you know something .
i' m smarter than you , and i' m gonna find out what i want to know ... ... wether you like it or not .
to a cop the explanation is never that complicated .
it' s always simple .
there' s no mistery to the street , no arch criminal behind it all .
somebody with power ...
keyser soze !
you think a guy like that comes this close to getting caught and sticks his head out ?
because you' re stupid , verbal !
because you' re a cripple !
what i want to know is who' s the gimp .
you know .
you' ve known the whole fucking time !
if he comes up for anything , it will be to get rid of me .
i can' t feel my legs ...
keyser .
first thing i learned on the job , you know what it was ?
he mentioned keyser soze ?
who ?
after that ... ... my guess is you' il never hear from him again .
the greatest trick the devil ever pulled ... ... was convincing the world he didn' t exist .
and like that ... ... he' s gone .
