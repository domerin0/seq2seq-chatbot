i don' t need to .
i do need to know who supplied you .
do you know why i' m asking you ?
in case somebody else muscles in .
is that the case ?
i stole it from stan .
stan irvine ?

he' s going out with my ma .
i knew he stashed it with the dogs , so i stole it , and my granddad' s teeth .
could be true .
he' s blaming a bent cop .
it is true .
i set him up .
i only phoned the polis to cover me .
stan' s not the sharpest .
so you thought we' d tell him ?
you' d take a tanking ?
he doesnae bother me , but he might take it out on my mam .
you took some chance , wee man .
