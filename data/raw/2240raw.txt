ready to go faster ?
all right .
no , no , no !
you' re gonna slide off .
you all right ?
are you sliding ?
yes .
no , if you' re sliding , i' m going to stop .
no , no , no .
you okay ?
okay .
more ?
yes !
that' s funny .
i could' ve sworn i saw a little girl by the name of emily come in here .
come out , come out , wherever you are ...
could she be hiding in the closet ?
i wonder where she could be .
maybe my eyes have deceived me .
i' m invisible , mommy .
well , if you' re invisible ... ... then how could i ... do this ? !
did you know where i was ?
not a clue .
you want alex ?
what is it ?
i love you more than anything else in the world .
you know that , don' t you ?
i love you , too .
good night , sweetheart .
make the face .
please .
now , go to sleep .
okay .
mommy !
sorry .
good night .
you coming to bed ?
in a little while .
something you want to talk about ?
some things are beyond therapy , david .
honey ?
i should' ve seen it coming .
all the signs were there .
the ones closest to you are the hardest to judge .
no , but i ...
i could' ve prevented it .
david , it' s not your fault .
how long have we known each other ?
trust me when i tell you this .
as difficult as it may seem , you' re ... you' re gonna have to try and start over .
we' re gonna move .
upstate .
the country .
that' s not exactly what i meant by " starting over .
what about emily ?
this is a traumatic time for her .
i think it' s important she stays here and works through this .
no , here , she' s flooded with memories .
i need to expose her to a new environment , new things to do ...
she' d be losing another person she depends on .
it' s only an hour away .
and ... you' re always welcome to come and see her .
and right now , i need to do what' s right for emily .
i need to be a full time dad .
i have a surprise for you .
when i was your age , my mom gave me one just like that .
and whenever i was feeling sad ,
i would open the lid , and all my sorrows went away .
do you like it ?
give me a hug .
you' re going to like it there .
all right , let' s go .
come on .
let' s take a look .
right on time .
dr. callaway ...
mr. haskins .
hello .
this is sheriff hafferty .
sheriff .
he routinely checks on the houses up here to make sure things run smoothly .
i see .
well , this is my daughter , emily .
this is sheriff hafferty .
emily .
how are you ?
this is mr. haskins .
he found us the house .
well , hello there , emily .
think your dad did a good job picking the house ?
she' s still deciding .
well , she sure is pretty .
thank you .
as i mentioned ,
woodland estates is mainly a summer community .
may be a little quiet up here till then .
hope that' s not a problem .
not at all .
great .
let me show you around the back .
you ever spent much time in the country ?
not much .
i used to camp when i was little , but i was always scared of the woods .
nothing to be scared of in these woods .
picked a nice spot .
biggest house on the lake .
let dr. callaway into his new home .
figure out which key ...
did you see where my daughter went ?
emily !
emily !
emily !
honey ?
you okay ?
come on .
let' s go back .
come on .
come on .
mr. haskins , sheriff ... we' il take it from here .
spaghetti and meatballs is your favorite dish .
you' re not hungry ?
i' d like to go to bed now .
i' il come up and kiss you good night .
oh , that' s funny .
i could have sworn i saw a little girl by the name of emily come in here .
i wonder ... where she' s hiding .
could she be ... could she be ... under the bed ? !
no .
could she be ... hiding ...
let' s see , where could she be hiding ?
could she be hiding in the ... closet !
okay ... since it' s the first night in a new house ,
i thought it would be a good time to start a new diary .
each day you can write down your feelings and thoughts , and then , one day , you can look back and see how much they' ve changed .
i love you more than anything else in the world , sweetheart .
you know that .
that' s what mommy said .
before she killed herself .
sweetheart , she meant what she said .
and so do i.
you want me to put this over here ?
okay .
all right .
good night .
good night , alex .
emily ?
emily !
em ?
emily ?
oh , there you are .
come on , sweetheart .
we' re going into town .
we have some errands to do .
hello .
hi ...
hi , there .
l i' m laura .
i live next door .
oh , i' m david .
how are you ?
uh , here .
these are for you .
oh , thank you very much .
my husband and i made the preserves ourselves .
oh , well ...
i didn' t even realize anyone else lived up here .
well , it does get pretty quiet in the off season .
oh , this is my daughter , emily .
emily , say hello to laura .
she' s our neighbor .
isn' t she adorable ?
you going to say hi ?
well , she gets a little shy around new faces .
i understand .
it' s going to be a real treat having both of you here .
oh , you' re on your way out .
i won' t keep you .
um , if you need anything , don' t hesitate to stop by .
same here .
and thank you for all the preserves .
the peach and apricot preserves .
enjoy .
thank you .
i' m gonna put this inside .
amy , don' t swing so high .
i' m going to tell your mom .
would you listen to me ?
hi .
hi .
i have , uh , a daughter the same age .
she' s in the car .
i' m elizabeth .
elizabeth young .
hi .
david callaway .
how are you ?
good .
nice to meet you .
are you visiting ?
just moved up from the city .
oh , usually it' s the other way around .
i know .
she your kid ?
oh , no .
no .
she' s my sister' s kid .
i' m the honorary baby sitter .
watch .
amy , be careful .
amy ...
amy .
she all right ?
amy , jesus , are you all right ?
that' s very funny .
oh , my god , you' re going to make me nuts , you know that ?
is your daughter this crazy ?
where' s alex ?
i don' t like her anymore .
did i just hear what i think i heard ?
are you mad , daddy ?
no , i' m not mad at all , honey .
i think it' s great .
you do ?
yeah .
good .
because i have a new friend .
a new friend ?
okay .
let me guess .
is it , um ...
veronica ?
no .
uh , is it , uh , patty ?
is it ...
he' s not a doll .
he' s ...
not a doll .
he .
okay , well , if he' s not a doll , then who is he ?
he doesn' t want me to talk about him .
doesn' t want you to talk about him ?
no .
well , what if i promise to keep it a secret , could you tell me then ?
so , what' s his name ?
he told me to call him charlie .
charlie ?
oh , that' s an interesting name .
charlie .
when did you meet charlie ?
today .
when we went to town ?
it was before that .
before that .
huh .
is he ... here right now ?
i think he' s sleeping .
okay .
well , in that case , we better not wake him , hmm ?
it' s not unusual for a traumatized child to create imaginary friends .
i know , i just wish she' d confide in me instead of using fantasy .
trauma causes pain .
eventually the mind will find a way to release it .
no kidding .
i' m the one who taught you that stuff .
as a matter of fact , you did , yes .
just have fun with her , david .
play with her .
that' s what she needs .
these are beginner rods .
let' s see ... two rods , $41 . 50 each ...
plus bait and tackle ...
sheriff .
you parked in a handicap zone .
oh , i didn' t even realize .
could you give me a break ?
i didn' t realize .
enjoy your day .
eh , so much for small town hospitality , honey .
shut the door .
we broke the law .
i know we broke the law .
shut the door .
the loch ness monster .
what ?
you know what that is ?
it' s in scotland .
this is a good spot , huh ?
honey , what are you doing ?
you think that' s a good idea ?
emily , we have bait .
see ?
all right .
did you have a nice time today ?
it was okay .
just okay ?
well , then , what could we have done to make it better ?
what if charlie was there ?
would he have made it better ?
he' s a lot of fun .
fun like how ?
fun like mommy .
it' s a little stuffy in here .
it' s stuck .
it' s okay , daddy .
it just ...
... three , two , one ...
happy new year !
emily , why would you do this ?
i didn' t do it .
what do you mean , you didn' t do it ?
there' s nobody here but us .
it wasn' t me .
this is your writing , and these are your crayons , honey .
it' s all right .
just tell me .
you don' t have to lie to me .
i' m not lying .
okay , well , if you didn' t do it , then who did ?
it was charlie .
she thinks i' m responsible
she thinks i' m responsible for alison' s death .
it' s charlie that holds you responsible .
use him , david .
use him to get through to her .
he' s the key .
l i have to go , i ...
i think i found her a real friend .
really ?
that' s great .
call me if you need me , okay ?

must be hard on emily .
have you ever been married ?
actually , i just got divorced .
i' m living with my sister and her husband till i can figure out my next move .
best way to get over the past is to start something new .

what' s so funny ?

he just left .
where' d he go ?

i thought you did .
i want to talk to charlie .
what would you like to talk about ?
i' d like to talk to him about all sorts of things .
like what ?
like , uh ... well , what makes him happy ... what makes him sad ...
so , what do you say ?
you think you can introduce us ?
i don' t think that' s going to work .

thank you .
thank you .
i wanted to apologize for my husband .
he said he had a ... awkward moment yesterday with you and emily .
that' s all right .
don' t worry about it .
he' s harmless , really .
he wouldn' t hurt a fly .
that' s fine .
it' s just that ... we lost a child recently a girl ... and in some ways , emily reminds us of her .
i see .
he was just ... reaching out .
hmm ?
there is nothing worse in this world than losing a child .
here , taste this .
i think it may be too salty .
oh .
okay .
not bad .
really ?
not bad .
oh , good .
really good .
wow !
you look so pretty .
you didn' t have to get all dressed up for me .
honey , would you go upstairs and change into something else , please ?
don' t you like it ?
not for dinner , no .
why not ?
you know why .
she looks so pretty .
let' s just eat .
i think you look really beautiful .
did daddy tell you that my mommy died ?
yes , he did .
and i' m very sorry .
did he tell you how she died ?
honey , i don' t think elizabeth really wants to hear how that happened , okay ?
she killed herself in our bathtub .
emily ...
slit her wrists with a razor .
emily .
that' s enough .
emily , i brought you something .
your dad asked me to bring over some of amy' s books .
these were some of my favorites when i was your age .
oh , that' s great .
give you a chance to see what the other kids are reading before you get started .
you gonna say thanks ?
emily ...
emily ...
emily , stop it .
that' s enough .
do you like her , daddy ?
stop this .
charlie says you do .
go to your room .
he says you like her
as much as mommy .
go to your room .
to your room .
if you' re going to behave this way , go to your room .
let' s hope you don' t wind up like her .
i' m sorry .
who' s charlie ?
oh , he' s her imaginary friend .
her only friend .
i always wanted her to have a better childhood than i had .
now look .
drive safely .
attention , please !
maybe after a few more martinis ...
charlie did it .
you do believe me , don' t you , daddy ?
why are you looking at me like that ?
mr. callaway .
i didn' t mean to disturb you .
thought you might be needing these .
those are the keys for the , uh , different rooms in the house .
i forgot to give them to you earlier .
i apologize .
it' s a little late to be delivering keys , isn' t it ?
well , i thought i could slip them under the door .
wife and i are going to canada first thing in the morning .
we' ve got a little cabin tucked away in the woods .
good place to clear the mind .
everything all right ?
well , enjoy .
what' s for breakfast ?
honey , why would charlie do such a horrible thing ?
is it because of elizabeth ?
charlie needs to understand something , honey .
elizabeth is not trying to take mommy' s place .
does he understand that ?
honey , i can' t help you if you don' t talk to me .
why doesn' t he like elizabeth ?
because she likes you .
and ?
he doesn' t want you to be happy .
honey ... you know this has nothing to do with charlie .
you do know that .
it' s about you , honey .
and that' s okay .
charlie doesn' t exist .
you shouldn' t say that .
why not ?
you' re going to make him mad .
oh , well , so what ?
i' il get him mad .
let him come out and yell at me .
good .
i want to see him .
where is he ?
you want to see him ?
who' s that supposed to be ?
charlie and mommy .
she would have liked him .
no , trust me , honey .
mommy wouldn' t like charlie .
that' s not what he says .
what do you mean ?
what do you mean ?
what does he say ?
what does he say ?
what does charlie say ?
talk to me .
what does he say ?
he says he would have satisfied her .
who told you to say that ?
charlie did .
no , who ... who told you that ?
charlie did .
there is no charlie .
who said it ?
charlie did !
he did not .
who said it ?
charlie !
charlie !
charlie !
charlie !
charlie !
charlie !
charlie !
charlie !
hey , sweetheart .
i' m so happy you came .
it' s so good to see you .

hey , david .
how are you ?
good .
good to see you .
good to see you , too .
glad you could come .
do you like it here ?
i' m having a lot of fun .
you are ?
tell me about your friend charlie .
he doesn' t like me to talk about him .
i' m sure he wouldn' t mind if you told me .
tell me , what do you guys do together ?
play games .
what kind of games ?
hide and seek .
that' s our favorite .
sounds like charlie' s a lot of fun .
so what do you guys talk about ?
i don' t know .
bunch of things .
sometimes he even talks about you .
really .
and what does he say ?
you can tell me .
he' s afraid you' re going to get in the way .
in the ...
in the way of what ?
our game .
what game is that ?
upsetting daddy .
isn' t she pretty ?
david , i' d like to bring emily back with me .
at least for a little while , so she can be evaluated .
i' m just worried bringing her back will make her worse .
she' s not well .
i know that .
and she' s not your patient .
i know that , too .
she thinks it' s a game .
she' s using charlie to get to you .
i know things haven' t gone as well as we hoped , but ... do you really think bringing her back to new york is going to make that much of a difference ?
it' s worth a try .
all right , look .
i' il give it two more weeks , and if there' s no improvement , i' il bring her back .
what are you doing , daddy ?
nothing .
what were you looking at ?
no , i was just getting ready to tuck you in .
good night .
daddy ?
yeah , sweetheart ?
can you close the door ?
you don' t want the light ?
i don' t need it anymore .
okay .
hi .
hello .
david .
i thought i' d return the favor .
oh , thank you .
mmm !
apple !
my favorite !
you can make yourself at home .
i' il be back in a second .
thank you .
you must think we' re pretty crazy keeping all these toys around .
it' s , um ...
it' s hard to find the right place for them , you know ?
i' m sorry .
no , you have nothing to be sorry about .
it' s just , i ...
i' ve had no one to talk to .
you know that i am a psychologist .
i' ve dealt with many people in similar circumstances , and if you and your husband would like to talk about this , it might help .
he' s ... been having ... a tough time this past couple of weeks .
in ln ... wh what sense ?
you have no idea how painful it can be .
how painful he can make it .
i' m sorry .
i' ve already said too much .
please , i can ...
listen to me .
please , i can help you .
no , he' il be back any moment .

thanks .
emily , i' m really sorry about what happened the other night .
i want you to know that i' m not trying to come between you and your dad .
do you think maybe we could start over ?
we could be friends ?
do you like games ?
i love games .
