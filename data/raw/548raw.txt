brother ignacio ?
what are you doing ?
five rings , padre .
to summon zorro in case there' s trouble .
if i know zorro , he' s already here .
aren' t you supposed to be in school ?
padre , what if zorro comes ?
i' il make sure he carves a z on your backside .
how' s that sound ?
really ?
a landslide in favor of statehood .
let' s hope the rest of california voted the same , huh ?
take this to the governor .
hermano , be careful .
our future' s in your hands .
i pray that the other provinces have been as peaceful as ours .
the latest model in heavy artillery , the henry repeater .
if god didn' t hurl lightning , he' d surely carry one of these .
state your business , mcgivens .
i haven' t voted yet .
i' m sorry , you' re too late .
the polls have already closed .
now , that doesn' t seem equitable .
i have rights too .
now , if you' d be kind enough , hand me that box , i' il be on my way .
you' d only force the people to vote again .
well , you remember that babylon was condemned to ashes ... ... for extending its empire to inferior races !
i come to deliver the lord' s work against this vote .
time to do the lord' s work .
zorro !
zorro !
zorro !
move it .
move it .
get out of the way !
get out of the way !
get him !
over the hill to the governor' s mansion .
i said , over the hill to the governor' s mansion !
we really have to work on your english .
zorro !
zorro !
zorro !
what happened ?
where are my men ?
they were held up , governor .
i offered my help .
citizens of san mateo !
today we have voted to join the union as a free state !
but this is only the beginning .
in three months ... ... every vote of every pueblo around california will be counted !
and it is my hope that we will finally call ourselves ... ... americans !
good boy .
your saddle is getting a little too tight , amigo .
tell me we won .
tell me we are free .
we' re free .
to statehood .
to us .
i wish i was there today .
you were .
i cannot believe it .
we have our lives back .
now we can take joaquin to a trip to spain .
i cannot imagine how it has changed .
elena ...
and new york .
you should see new york , alejandro .
it' s as if the whole world has moved onto one tiny island .
elena , i' ve been thinking and ...
never a good sign .
listen , california won' t really be a state for another three months .
yes ?
the federal marshals may need help keeping things under control until then .
look , i know what you' re thinking ...
elena .
elena , listen , listen .
no , here is me , here is quitting .
we' re this far apart .
elena .
i cannot believe it .
i cannot believe i fell for it .
husband promises to quit , gullible wife believes him .
how could i be so stupid ?
oh , elena , you' re overreacting .
i' m overreacting ?
you made a promise .
we made a promise .
i know .
you are missing your son' s entire life .
no , no , no .
no , no , no .
i am not missing anything .
oh , really ?
really .
what is his teacher' s name ?
that' s an easy one .
mister ...
brother ...
father kin ...
jin ...
hoofer ?
so i have a bad memory .
what does that prove ?
that you do not know your own son .
and even worse , he does not know you .
what would you rather have me do ?
live my life as a wealthy don ?
order servants around all day ?
is that what you think i do , huh ?
order servants around all day ?
no , no , don' t twist my words .
people still need zorro .
no , no , no .
you need zorro .
look me in the eyes and tell me that is not true .
you remember what you said the day joaquin was born ?
my family is my life .
do you know how lucky you are to have made it this far ?
alive ?
that your enemies have not discovered who we are ?
for 10 years , you have fought to give california its freedom .
why can' t you give us ours ?
they are calling you .
it' s who i am , elena .
it' s who i am .
what happened to the man i married ?
what happened to the woman who used to fight by my side ?
she had a son .
so he' il grow up to be a nice little aristocrat ... ... who has no idea where he came from ... ... and doesn' t care about anyone but himself .
beautiful .
if you walk out that door , you are not sleeping here tonight .
maybe i' il just take my suitcase .
i hope you and tornado are very happy together .
we will be .
i love you .
i spy with my little eye ... ... something beginning with h.
why wasn' t papi at breakfast ?
i told you .
he left early on business .
he always goes on business .
yes , he does .
what exactly does he do ?
well , he is a don .
and he meets with other dons ... ... and they discuss land and investments ... ... and it' s all very important work .
so he sits around with friends counting money .
oh , joaquin .
you should not be so hard on your father .
you are more like him than you think .
we can talk more about this later , all right ?
i love you .
who are you ?
the real question , seora de la vega , is who are you ?
the devoted wife of a wealthy don ?
or an independent woman held captive by her husband' s secrets ?
what do you want ?
your help .
one ?
i tell you , de la vega , women say they want one thing ... ... but what they really want is everything else .
think of this as a vacation from the shackles of matrimony .
isn' t it possible our wives marry us ... ... because they want to spend some time with their husbands ?
so let me understand this .
if i take your advice ... ... i can look forward to spending my days pruning in a tub of naked men ?
thanks for the advice .
but no .
where are you going ?
to beg elena' s forgiveness .
goodness me .
might one of you be don alejandro de la vega ?
yes .
phineas gendler , attorney at law .
i' m here on behalf of your wife .
if you should have any questions , my address is on the letterhead .
good day , sir .
gentlemen .
i' m sorry , seor .
but you told me to make sure you didn' t sleep past 2 today .
what' s today ?
wednesday .
of course .
i have to pick up joaquin .
what happened to my clothes ?
i removed them last night so you wouldn' t catch pneumonia .
you removed them ?
after you came back from the cantina , you went for a swim .
in my clothes ?
this hotel doesn' t have a pool .
we have a fountain .
i see .
well , thank you , lupe .
perhaps you just can turn around , eh ?
i' il see you at confession , my child .
don' t look at me like that .
i know what you' re gonna say .
no .
no , i came here to lift your spirits , not to dampen them .
who said my spirit needed lifting ?
alejandro , you are being a pig headed fool .
why don' t you just tell elena you were wrong .
she' s the one who wanted me to live a lie .
to stop being myself .
as if california could live without me .
wake up .
i haven' t had to ring that bell in three months .
you should be rejoicing .
i am rejoicing !
all right .
you cannot rot in this room forever .
a vineyard is opening tonight .
you' re coming to the party with me .
my whole life is a party .
thank you , no .
be at the lobby at 8 .
and don' t bother coming to confession , because i' il never forgive you .
you' d blackmail my soul , eh ?
hell , yes .
now ... ... would anyone else like to interrupt my lecture ... ... by asking to go to the bathroom ?
no .
who can tell me what this word means ?
joaquin ?
joaquin de la vega !
perhaps you can tell the class what statehood means to you .
no more exploitation of the peasants by the rich ... ... who oppress us with a flaming poker of injustice .
and how exactly does a flaming poker fit into your little theory ?
it fits ... ... in your butt .
now i will give you something to laugh about .
come here .
no ?
joaquin !
joaquin !
joaquin !
get back inside !
joaquin .
so , what' s with you , huh ?
you' re lucky father quintero didn' t throw you out for good .
stop making excuses .
why do you keep picking fights ?
you don' t understand .
sometimes you have to fight .
oh , really ?
says who ?
says him .
listen , if zorro were here , he' d tell you fighting isn' t always the answer .
how do you know what he' d say ?
trust me , i know him a lot better than you think .
no , you don' t .
you never been in a fight in your life .
you didn' t even fight to keep mom .
i am your father , little man .
don' t talk to me like that .
there' s nothing on earth i wouldn' t do for you or your mother .
understand ?
don alejandro .
don alejandro .
guillermo .
blanca .
hello .
look at little jos .
poor thing .
he' s as ugly as his mother .
look at joaquin .
you' re growing up so fast .
if business keeps up , we' il be able to pay you back sooner than we thought .
i told you , it was a gift .
to celebrate your son' s birth .
hey , seor .
that knife is only 2 dollars .
well , i' il give you 500 for it .
and for that , i' il take the deed to your rancho , with the lord' s gratitude .
we' ve already told you , we' il never sell .
family man like you might wanna keep his woman on a shorter leash .
they said they are not selling , sir .
have we met before , sir ?
i would remember a man with wooden teeth .
and i' d remember a mex breed dressed like a white man .
you think your pappy' s gonna crow , little man ?
or is he gonna cluck ?
leave him out of ...
seor , as a gentleman , i am obliged to teach my son to turn the o ...
you mean that cheek ?
is everything all right , boys ?
respects to you , officer .
respects , respects .
think about my offer , or i' il be obliged to do the lord' s work .
ten minutes , then i' m going .
effervescent , yet tenacious .
i thought you were forbidden to drink .
what the ... ?
i need at least one vice to keep in touch with sinners .
whatever .
who owns this vineyard anyway ?
a count recently in from france .
i' m told he purchased it from don gallo' s widow .
french count , you say ?
he' s probably still in his parlor putting on makeup .
or his perfume , perhaps .
rumor has it they invented it to avoid bathing .
and you are ... ?
de la vega .
alejandro de la vega .
you' re de la vega .
what an honor .
i' ve heard so much about you .
really ?
from whom ?
you know , i' d love to continue this conversation ... ... but i' m wanted elsewhere .
please excuse me .
i just met the most charming fellow .
and who might that be ?
ladies and gentlemen !
welcome .
i still don' t know why they call it a winetasting .
after two glasses you can' t taste anything .
friends , californians .
this vineyard represents what i hope will become an industry ... ... that depends on the people for its success .
involving them instead of exploiting them .
that' s what america means to me .
the promise of a country by the people , for the people !
a country blessed with limitless beauty .
but none more stunning than my escort for the evening .
ladies and gentlemen ... ... seora elena de la vega !
well , i' m pooped .
come on , let' s go .
go ?
i don' t wanna go .
i' m having so much fun .
monsieur and madame lupon .
pleasure , madame .
thank you .
very nice to meet you .
alejandro .
elena .
armand .
de la vega .
count .
you know each other ?
we shared a giggle at the buffet table .
it seems that' s not all we have shared .
allow me to defuse an awkward situation .
elena has portrayed you as a man of impeccable character .
i am honored to be mentioned at all .
why , i nearly forgot we were still married only three months ago .
a blessing on your vineyard , count .
thank you for inviting us , but we have a mass ...
don' t be rude , felipe .
i' m just dying to know how the lovebirds met .
another time .
we have many guests to greet .
armand , good evening .
governor riley .
you honor us with your presence .
may i present my wife , mary .
your speech was incredibly moving , count .
i' m glad you' re not running for office against my husband .
i wouldn' t challenge the man who' s going to lead california into the union .
i fear there may not be much of a union left to join , governor .
everyone , may i introduce ... ... colonel r. s. beauregard , of the 1 st alabama infantry .
what brings you here , colonel ?
the threat of civil war , my dear .
once california joins the union , the confederate states' il be outnumbered .
my countrymen find that troubling .
all this talk of politics , you know how it bores me , armand .
shall we dance ?
of course .
excuse us , gentlemen .
ladies and gentlemen , the imperial quadrille .
perhaps you shouldn' t drink on an empty stomach .
perhaps you should wear lipstick if you' re gonna act like my mother .
say the word and i' il escort you home .
and leave your guests ?
in a heartbeat .
i care for you too much to subject you to an evening of forced smiles , elena .
you .
you are the one not acting like yourself .
since when do politics bore you ?
since when did you start caring what i think ?
you .
if you wish , i' il have him escorted out .
i can handle him .
for the love of god , let' s get out of this place .
i can handle her !
you must tell me how you met .
years ago , in spain .
we were at finishing school together .
oh , how nice .
you were reunited so he could finish .
don' t force me to embarrass you .
sorry , too late !
so tell me , count , what does your title rank among noblemen ?
it is higher than , say , a duke ?
oh , it' s rather common , actually .
much like a don .
oh , he' s a delight .
rich , good looking and royalty .
is there anything i can say to make you leave ?
you can fall to your knees and beg me to take you back .
i would not want to ruin my dress .
good .
i' m enjoying single life .
is that supposed to make me jealous ?
does it ?
never !
who' s looking after joaquin while his mother spends her nights out ?
i have not spent my nights out .
i haven' t even told joaquin !
now , i think you should go !
you know ...
let me go !
i finally understand why you left me .
it was beneath you to marry a peasant like me .
you' re drunk .
your stepfather would be so proud ... ... to see you take your rightful place on the arms of royalty !
keep your voice down !
congratulations , your highness !
if you didn' t know me better than that , then you never knew me at all .
no .
thank you ... ... for your hospitality , count .
could you ... ?
could you ... ?
could you ... ?
could you give me that back ?
hey , hey !
cut it out !
you had enough .
stinky ...
aren' t you forgetting something , estpido ? !
count armand ... ... with his fancy wine and the froufrou accent .
how could elena choose a man like that ?
i' il make her want me back so badly , she will be weeping with desire .
nobody leaves my tequila worm dangling in the wind !
oh , my god .
thank you .
god bless you , seor .
how kind of you .
i was trying to impress you .
if you truly want to impress me , invite me over for dinner tonight .
cook me something sinful .
why not dine at your hacienda ?
i' d really like to meet your son .
please try and understand , armand .
he' s not ready for another man in my life just yet .
of course .
i understand .
what is it ?
oh , this hat .
it' s breathtaking .
shall i purchase it for you ?
on second thought , who needs another hat ?
what i need is ... ... a pipe !
a pipe ?
a pipe .
like my father used to smoke .
i hope i do not repulse you with my unladylike habit .
no , no .
on the contrary , you fascinate me .
oh , there' s a vendor .
wait here , won' t you ?
what are you doing here ?
when did you start smoking a pipe ?
i don' t smoke .
i said that to get rid of him so i can get rid of you .
i have to talk to you about last night .
i forgive you .
goodbye .
no , no , no , not that .
after .
i saw something in the forest .
what are you talking about ?
yes , what are you talking about ?
an explosion .
close to your chateau , in fact .
like nothing i have ever seen .
i simply wanted to make sure you were both safe .
as much as you had to drink last night , i' m sure your vision was impaired .
yet somehow it' s all becoming clear .
if you have any respect for the relationship you shared with elena ... ... let it die with dignity .
i have to know i am losing her to a better man .
i can assure you of that .
all right , that is enough .
alejandro , time to go .
elena , please .
alejandro has come for peace of mind .
i am obliged to give it to him .
perhaps we can settle this like gentlemen .
you do play polo , i take it ?
doesn' t everyone ?
i suggest we play as they do in slovenia .
a fine city .
country .
naturally .
may i offer you something to drink ?
double tequila , no salt .
perhaps a game of croquet would be less hazardous to your health .
did you drop something ?
or you just resting ?
you know , i think i like this game .
promise me when you lose you will leave us alone .
what makes you think i will lose ?
woman' s intuition .
to the victor go the spoils .
now keep your promise and go .
you cheated , so i take it back .
goodbye , alejandro .
what do you really know about this man ?
we were never meant to be together .
you don' t love him .
after 10 years of marriage , you cannot hide the truth from me .
de la cruz is the bartender who works at the saloon across the street .
he says he overheard mcgivens gathering his men to go see cortez .
your father asked me to pick ...
cortez !
the deed , if you please .
bring it here .
no , guillermo , don' t !
please , seor .
this land is all we have .
and the lord shall expel them before you ... ... and ye shall possess their land !
salvation ... ... damnation .
got one thing in common .
you gotta die to find either one .
how true .
drop your guns .
all of you !
guillermo , blanca , get in the house .
you are one blind mexican .
you don' t know what you' re getting yourself into .
neither do you .
shoot him !
let him be !
come on !
let' s move !
don' t let them hurt you .
i won' t .
i promise .
go on !
break it down !
blanca .
blanca .
no !
guillermo !
guillermo !
guillermo .
guillermo .
guillermo , please talk to me .
talk to me !
please !
what are you trying to tell me , huh ?
no matter what choice i make , it' s always the wrong one !
i have failed everyone i ever loved .
my wife , my son and now the people too !
what do you want from me ? !
help me .
i have always listened to my heart .
and it speaks to me now of a great darkness .
i fear guillermo cortez was only the beginning ... ... and that elena is in great danger too .
so i beg you ... ... give me the courage , the strength ... ... to wear the mask a little longer .
allow zorro one last ride .
come here .
she' s going to the vineyard .
we can post men near the gate in case we have to pull her out .
if she' s compromised , she' s of no further use .
consider her an acceptable loss .
master , a word ?
please , excuse me a moment .
the shipment arrives at maderas cove .
the carving is beautiful .
and what is through that door ?
private chapel .
piety is a long standing tradition in my family .
i' d show it to you , but dinner' s waiting .
that was absolutely delicious .
and now ...
oh , no , i' m sorry , marie , i do not smoke .
unless it is my pipe , of course .
oh , you remembered .
how thoughtful .
but i think i should let my stomach settle first .
elena .
i want to ask you something .
something i should' ve asked you many years ago .
before you do , my love , answer me one question .
whatever your heart desires .
where is the bathroom ?
i would like to powder my cheeks .
of course .
down the hall .
excuse me .
excuse me , sir .
a gentleman is here to see you .
he says it' s important .
he' s building a track to the vineyard .
i presume you have the deed ... ... since you deemed it necessary to interrupt my dinner .
right here .
but it seems we have a fly in the ointment .
or should i say a fox .
zorro .
i' ve heard the name among the locals .
he' s a peasant masquerading as a folk hero .
men like that usually find their way to the guillotine .
i' ve been informed one of my shipping vessels is arriving tomorrow .
they' il anchor off maderas cove .
the cargo must be brought here safely .
i want no mistakes .
now that we have the deed , will the track be completed on time ?
it' il take my boys two days to cover the quarter mile .
i' il hold you to that , mr. mcgivens .
otherwise you get nothing .
listen to me , you backwards ass frog ... ... you hedge on my money , you won' t ever see me co ...
this dagger , mr. mcgivens ... ... jake ... ... has been in my family for generations .
if you ever talk to me like that again ... ... i will cut out your tongue and i' il feed it to my dogs .
understood ?
your men have two days , mr. mcgivens ... ... then the future begins .
i trust you can find your own way out .
orbis unum .
alejandro !
for god' s sake , why can' t you leave me alone ?
elena , i was right .
armand is not who you think he is .
you have no idea who i think he is .
i think i know .
no , because you do not think .
get out before somebody sees you .
elena , listen to me .
guillermo cortez is dead .
what ?
armand needed his land to build a railroad .
he' s planning something .
how do you know this ?
oh , no .
i won' t tell you what i know until you tell me what you know .
if you wanna know , i need to know why you are living in sin with an evil count !
elena ?
elena ?
there you are .
forgive me , armand .
i just had the sudden urge to step out for a puff .
are you all right ?
fine .
my god , you' re turning green .
it' s just your presence takes my breath away .
good , because i have a little something for you .
a customary spanish offering ... ... for when a man asks a woman for her hand in marriage .
let me do this on one knee so i can look up into your eyes .
oh , no , don' t look up .
is that a yes ?
it' s a definite maybe .
i know it' s sudden , given what you' ve just been through ... ... but i want to give you everything your former husband couldn' t .
you don' t have to answer now ... ... but whatever you decide , the necklace is yours .
thank you .
but i have to go .
i must put joaquin to bed .
of course .
your children require attention .
pearls .
welcome , children , to bear point .
it was on this desolate spot ... ... that our state flag was raised for the first time .
tomorrow our governor will be hosting a celebration here ... ... to honor california' s statehood .
joaquin de la vega !
are you paying attention ?
take out your notebooks ...
hold up .
scorcher of a day , ain' t it , kids ?
is there something i can help you with , seor ?
don' t let me interrupt the lesson , father .
i' m just on my way to do the lord' s work .
mount up , boys .
come on .
grab that there , will you ?
let' s get to work , boys .
all right !
what are you doing here kid ?
looking at two of the ugliest guys i' ve ever seen .
come on .
do you want a piece of me ?
carajo !!
zorro nos salvaste
stay there !
orbis unum .
i can' t believe it' s you .
you' re really zorro .
and that' s tornado , right ?
i mean , whoa .
look at him .
he' s huge .
it' s just a scratch .
so you gonna say something or what ?
let' s speak in spanish , the language of our fathers .
my mother won' t believe this !
no , it would be better if you didn' t tell your mother about this .
why not ?
i' m the one asking the questions .
now , why aren' t you in school ?
the man with the scar on his face .
i knew he was up to something .
you really showed that son of a bitch .
watch your mouth .
those men are killers .
whatever they had in those crates was very dangerous ... ... and now i don' t know what it was , as i was too busy getting you out of trouble .
you mean this ?
soap ? !
that' s all there was ?
lots and lots of it .
are you sure ?
would i lie to you ?
spanish , nio , spanish , and this isn' t a game .
your father would have a heart attack if he knew what you did .
no , he wouldn' t , he doesn' t care .
yesterday he forgot about me .
no , i don' t think he forgot .
what you have to understand is ...
no .
your father should have been there .
next time he will be .
how do you know ?
i know .
i promise .
thank , zorro
a serpent circling the globe .
are you sure that this is the symbol you saw on the crate ?
orbis unum . " yeah .
it' s latin .
it means " one world .
it represents the knights of aragon ... ... an ancient brotherhood that ruled europe in secrecy after the crusades .
wait , wait , wait .
armand is a knight ?
some believe they are the masters behind all the kings in europe ... ... even today .
here is a prophecy they wrote nearly 1000 years ago .
there shall be a land in the west of great power ... ... that shall rise to threaten the serpent .
only by turning the power onto itself shall the serpent survive .
a land in the west .
america .
they want to destroy it .
with the soap ?
with the soap ?
thank you .
i had a wonderful time .
unfortunate that it has to end .
it does ?
some colleagues of mine are arriving from europe this evening .
the meeting may run late .
perhaps we could meet for breakfast ?
i cannot wait that long .
i want to be your wife , armand .
if i am going to be the lady of the house ... ... i want to start making myself at home .
i suppose we could have a late supper .
i will wait for you after your meeting .
then perhaps i can stay .
excuse me .
sir !
sir !
hotel vista grande .
what the ... ?
who are you ?
i' m agent pike .
this is agent harrigan .
we' re the pinkertons .
operatives of the united states government .
so you are the good guys ?
we live in perilous times , mr. de la vega .
america' s gates have been thrown wide open ... ... to people from foreign lands .
which is why , on occasion , we require certain individuals ... ... to aid in our country' s defense .
people like your ex wife .
elena ?
works for you ?
as a spy ?
until california' s statehood becomes official ... ... we don' t have jurisdiction to serve armand with a search warrant .
so we needed someone who could gain his trust .
and who more suited to the task than the woman he never forgot ?
before he arrived , we intercepted a telegram ... ... he' d dispatched to his associates throughout europe .
in that telegram , he claimed to be on the verge of producing a new weapon ... ... with a single target in mind .
the united states of america .
what kind of weapon could do that ?
your ex wife may be on the verge to answer that question .
and every time you interfere , you jeopardize her cover .
understand ?
the divorce was your idea , wasn' t it ?
you blackmailed elena to lure in the count ...
we prefer to think of it as a mutual understanding .
she agrees to help us ... ... and we promise to keep the name of zorro secret from his enemies .
a name you share with your wife and son .
i know something that might help you .
i will send you both to hell for this !
our country must be protected , de la vega , without apology .
zorro is a relic of the past .
this belongs in a museum .
so do you .
soon we will both be free .
hasta pronto mi amor
bonsoir , marie .
armand is expecting me .
you are early , madame .
the count is still indisposed .
well , perhaps i can wait in the parlor .
thank you so much , marie .
joaquin ?
joaquin !
hey !
hey !
come here .
dad ?
what are you doing in a bar ?
what are you doing in jail ?
i asked you first .
i went looking everywhere for you .
it' s about mom .
is she okay ?
no .
i mean , yes , but no .
a man came to the house .
he asked her to marry him .
she said yes .
i know you still love her .
you said you' d do anything for her .
you can' t be in jail !
how can you be in jail ? !
you gotta stop her .

joaquin .
joaquin .
you are a genius , a genius .
but i don' t want to catch you breaking anyone out of jail again .
without my permission , i mean .

or i break the kid' s neck !
help me !
i' m too young to die !
i got my whole life ahead of me !
kill him .
where did you learn to do that ?
prison changes a man , son .
let' s go .
listen , joaquin .
i have to go alone .
what ?
i just got you out of jail !
what if he puts up a fight ?
i' m not going there to fight .
i am going to reason with him .
you can' t reason with him .
joaquin , the world is a little more complicated than you think .
no , it isn' t .
there' s right and wrong .
i don' t have the time to argue with you .
i' m sorry .
come , joaquincito .
you don' t deserve mom .
armand went through there .
we have to hurry .
i know about the pinkertons .
how ?
it doesn' t matter .
they told me everything .
it' s all right , i forgive you .
you forgive me ?
no , no .
i forgive you .
you !
for what ?
everything you put me through .
you ?
i would not be in this mess if you had kept your mask on .
really ?
then why are you still wearing his necklace ?
i' m undercover .
besides , these are pearls .
you never gave me pearls .
you said you didn' t care about that .
i lied .
every woman loves pearls .
well , now you have them , princess .
when i said that we were never meant to be together , i meant it .
finally we agree on something .
this changes nothing .
absolutely not .
follow me .
always .
orbis unum .
orbis unum .
fellow knights of aragon ... ... soon the power of the united states will be so great ... ... it will overshadow us .
lts people .
they are divided by north and south .
a civil war is inevitable .
the only question is , who will claim victory ?
we will determine the outcome ...
an average bar of soap .
quite harmless in its current form .
but science has shown us how to extract the glycerin ... ... and transform it into a compound ... ... 13 times more powerful than gunpowder .
nitroglycerin .
for months , this vineyard has been a cover for its manufacture .
tomorrow , a shipment of nitro will depart by train .
it will be met at the state line by colonel beauregard ... ... who will take possession of the shipment ... ... and distribute it throughout the confederate army .
as we speak ... ... they' re preparing to launch ... ... a preemptive strike against washington ... ... forever tearing this country apart .
gentlemen , the knights of aragon ... ... will soon be restored to our former glory ... ... as we stand in shadow and watch america destroy itself !
i' ve heard enough .
brothers , you know my spirit is with you .
but we risk antagonizing a sleeping giant if we fail .
i' il see myself out .
lord dillingham .
would a demonstration put your mind at ease ?
unless you come to confess ... ... you have no business here , mcgivens .
funny you should mention confession , padre ... ... seeing that you' re obliged to keep the secrets of your flock .
joaquincito , go back inside !
who' s zorro ?
you know , zorro could be anyone at all .
come on , now .
we' re both men of god .
you can tell me .
hey , boss .
lord hates a liar .
all right , i' il tell you .
run !
felipe !
you killed felipe !
gentlemen ... ... the future .
this facility will provide a continuous supply of nitro ... ... to the southern battlefront .
i' il be returning to europe shortly ... ... but ferroq will remain to oversee the operation .
the nitro has been concealed in these bottles ... ... to circumvent any prying northern patrol .
an urgent matter requires your attention at the hacienda .
he' s going back to the hacienda .
i have to get back before he does .
i' il keep the train from leaving .
go .
elena .
be careful .
armand .
my goodness , i must have dozed off and your dogs startled me .
perhaps they thought you were someone you' re not .
i' m told you arrived early .
i could not wait .
i' m having a special meal prepared .
i hope you' re hungry .
i' m famished .
thank you , marie .
you are not hungry ?
tasty , is it ?
it' s unusual .
is it quail ?
pigeon .
as you said , elena ... ... we see the people we love as we wish them to be ... ... not as who they really are .
did you actually think ... ... that i would be swept off my feet by a sadistic coward like you ?
i thought you were a woman of vision .
vision . " i could barely stomach the sight of you , armand .
the only way i could bear your touch was to imagine you were alejandro .
your stepfather would be ashamed .
you' ve become nothing more than a common woman ... ... devoted to a common man .
i take that as a compliment .
mama !
oh , joaquin !
padre' s dead and the kid' s a witness .
no , no , no .
we' il need the next batch of it .
put some more here now .
we' il rendezvous at clanton' s pass .
you and your men can assume control of the train there .
zorro !
zorro !
no !
if you please .
remove his mask .
you . papi !!!
you' ve lost it all .
your wife .
your son .
and for what ?
for this ?
no matter where you go , armand ... ... whatever you do ... ... the world isn' t big enough to hide from me .
goodbye , de la vega .
no !
armand , no !
papi ! no
please .
not in front of joaquin .
please .
as soon as we' re gone .
elena .
my family is my life .
shame about your friend the padre .
but he died with god' s name on his lips ... ... and a bullet in his heart .
and now i send you out , a sheep amongst wolves .
thank god ... ... you' re alive .
i already did .
listen , go to the marshal' s office ... ... and tell them what armand is doing here .
where are you going ?
to catch a train .
can i get you something to drink ?
you can lock me in a tower forever ... ... and i will never stop hating you .
you may feel differently when you see how joaquin enjoys ... ... the life of an aristocrat .
i can' t wait till my papi kicks your ...
joaquin !
zorro !
zorro , zorro !
don' t touch him !
guards !
good boy .
well done .
let' s see how much your father truly loves you .
get the boy !
joaquin , quick .
keep going .
what are you doing ?
when the car stops , get off and follow the tracks back to town .
you are the son of zorro .
you can do it .
now , go .
how did you get in here ?
so the devil will know who sent you .
the drinks are on me .
my fellow californians ... ... we have gathered here at historic bear point ... ... to make official our entrance into the united states of america !
bravo !
vamos tornado !!
welcome to the union , governor .
look at you .
a real heartbreaker , huh ?
dad ?
yeah ?
why didn' t you tell me who you are ?
come here .
joaquin ... ... when you were born , i vowed i would give my life to keep you safe .
i thought i could protect you by hiding the truth .
but your mother was right .
it wasn' t my secret to keep .
it belongs to all of us .
so i promise i will never lie to you again .
never .
i bless these rings in the name of the father , the son and the holy spirit .
elena ... ... receive this ring as a sign of my love and fidelity .
alejandro ... ... receive this ring as a sign of my love and fidelity .
today you join in the fullness of time for all eternity .
yea , seeketh tolerance when easily provoked .
love endureth , for it keeps no score of wrongs .
love bears all things and believes all things .
love endures day by day ... ... hour by hour ... ... minute by minute .
padre .
love is patient ...
padre .
can you hurry it up a little ?
the people are calling .
it' s who we are .
do you want her back ?
of course i do .
and you take him ?
lf i must .
you may now kiss the bride .
again .
don' t wait up .
never .
