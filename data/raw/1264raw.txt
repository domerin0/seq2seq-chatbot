i was the one that wanted to get married .
he didn' t really want it . . . . . . but he did it .
i don' t know why .
why did you want to get married ?
i thought it would help me .
but it didn' t .
i was so confused .
i was doing . . . . . . insane things .
what sort of things , leon ?
after the wedding . . . . . . i ran off for 1 0 days to atlantic city .
sonny was frantic .
he knew i' d been drinking .
he didn' t know where i was , who i was with .
i couldn' t explain the things i did .
so i went to a psychiatrist . . . . . . who told me . . . . . . that i was a woman trapped in a man' s body .
so right away he wanted to give me money for the sex change operation .
but where was he going to get it ? $2, 500 ?
my god , he was in hock up to his ears already .
he needed the money for your operation ?
it drove him crazy .
he would fly into these rages .
and i got more depressed than ever .
i knew i' d never get my operation .
so i tried to kill myself .
i took about a half a pound of pills .
blues , yellows , screamers , uppers , downers , you name it .
and i wound up in the hospital .
and sonny comes there . . . . . . and he just looks at me .
and he says . . . . . .
why , leon ?
when things were going so good ?
don' t you think . . .
. . . he did it for you ?
yeah , i guess so .
don' t you think you owe it to him to try to get him out ?
i can' t talk to him .
you' re up to your neck in it .
you' re an accessory .
they can' t hold me responsible .
wait , you could help us a little .
i' m afraid .
just talk to him for a minute .
how can he hurt you on the phone ?
i can' t .
i don' t know what to . . . .
just talk with him on the phone .
you think about it .
he won' t talk to you .
what do you mean he won' t talk to me ?
i' il work on it .
i thought you were doing that .
he won' t talk to me .
