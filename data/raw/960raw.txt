and why the hell did we get married ... when we had loving each other so completely nailed ?
i don' t know .
ten seconds .
well , why does anyone get married ?
does it make sense to be with one person ... for your entire life ?
people change .
they grow .
you' re on , tom .
maybe we' d still be together ... if i' d gotten the proposal right ... but nope ...
the proposal is critical , and i blew it .
tom !
this is tom leezak ... with knr traffic at 2 : 06 a . m .
at this hour , there are approximately seven vehicles ... on all southland freeways .
so if you feel like skateboarding down the 405 ... she' s wide open .

yeah .

he has a low tolerance ... for those kinds of annoyances .
but then it turned into this , like , shrill ... c caw ...

i love sarah .
that' s all i need to know .
well , you really missed the boat ... didn' t you , prentiss ?
yes , i did , dan .
you bet your ass you did .
i should' ve been courting sarah ... instead of putting in 19 hour days at the office .
anyway ... congratulations , to both of you .
seriously , from ... from my heart .
thank you , peter .
you' re a lucky man .
hey , i know that .
grab a flute ofbubbly and rise .
everybody ready ?
why is peter prentiss here ?
dad' s doing a business deal with him .
all right .
health , wealth , happiness !
health , wealth , happiness !
all right .
peewee , 10 yard out .
leezak , gimme a five yard slant .
you got this , man .
don' t worry about it .
calm down .
what do you mean , calm down ?
hey , why do bad things happen to good people ?
that' s what i want to know .
where' s that in your book ?
she' s very determined , you know .
are you kidding ?
look , he' s a polack .
no , he' s a ...
he' s a polack .
i know that .
i warned you .
let' s see what leezak' s packing .
ready ?
all right .
and break !
break !
on one .
ready ?
break !
you girls ready for this ?

set !
unh !
oh .
gee .
that was a hard one .
that was a tough one .
yeah !
that' s what i' m talkin ' about .
what are you doing , willie ?
hey , i slipped .
i still got my flag .
i' m good .
i' m good .
oh , my peewee .
always moving so fast .
you move in together after a month ...
live together for nine months , and now you' re engaged .
oh , i know you love him , but you know ... sometimes it takes more than love ... to sustain a marriage .
you need to be old enough to know who you are ... and what you want and who he is .
oh , mom , mom , he' s wild and spontaneous ... and hysterical and offbeat ... and on top of all that ... he' s centered , and he' s down to earth .
he' s everything i want ... and we have this passion for each other ... that' s just ... oh !
i' m jealous .
ha ha ha !
all right .
first thing tomorrow ... we' re gonna plan this wedding !
hey , you .
so i guess everyone thinks that we' re crazy ... for doing this .
now , when did we start caring about what other people think ?
well , are you sure that ... you don' t want to marry a guy like peter ?
if i wanted to know exactly what my life would be ... from here on out ...
i would marry a guy like peter .
but i love not knowing .
i love our messy loft .
your beater car .
ha ha .
i want to start a life with you .
sarah ?
go .
hi , daddy .
peewee ... marriage is like a business investment .
its ...
its long term viability ... is best established unemotionally .
bottom line , daddy ?
we love each other .
that is all that matters , tsk .
leezak .
good night , sir .
congratulations , mr. leezak .
big daddy leezak' s in the house . !
oh , i hope she doesn' t spook on you , man .
what do you mean ?
i love sarah .
don' t get me wrong , but ... rich chicks spook .
a powerful daddy plus family money ... equals expectations .
expectations are like a fungal rot on a marriage .
my marriage is not gonna have a fungal rot .
we' re gonna be happily married every day ... for the rest of our lives .
unless she finds out that you slaughtered her dog .
oh , don' t worry .
i' il take that to my grave .
okay .
if you change your mind at the altar ... just pass out .
i' m not going to change my mind .
okay .
i' m just saying if you do ... just hit the floor .
thank you , but it' s not gonna happen .
so , you' re sure you' re ready ... to give up your grazing rights ?
i' m not a grazer , kyle .
well , what if you became one later in life ?
i mean , over the next 10 years ... you' re giving up five hayrides per year .
so i can either be happily married to sarah ... or have 50 one night stands .
minimum .
that' s not even a choice .
okay , okay .
let' s move on .
are there any chicks you didn' t have ... that you wish you had ?
you are , like , the worst best man ever .
hey , peter . !
over here , prentiss .
i can' t believe she invited prentiss .
glad you made it , buddy .
hey , man .
what' s going on ?
did she ever hook up with that yahoo ?
they went backpacking in europe once .
it was after high school .
i don' t think anything happened .
whoa .
you' re getting married ... and she didn' t share the roster ?
she shared the roster .
merrick and bruce .
what about prentiss ?
and you never asked again ?
i won .
it' s irrelevant .
oh .
okay .
as long as you' re okay with a bogus roster .
it' s not a bogus roster .
is he on , or is he off ?
he' s ...
shut up .
huh ?
huh ?
and you could' ve had peter .
i did have peter .
it wasn' t that hot , okay ?
excuse me ?
i was in seattle ... helping on an appraisal ... ran into peter ...
we went out .
i drank way too much ... and before i knew it we ... tussled .
you bad girl .
i wanted to tell tom so many times ... but he gets so jealous , you know ?
listen , it doesn' t matter that he doesn' t know .
it' s not like you guys were married ... and even if you were ...
no , no , no .
it matters to me .
it' s like living a lie .
i cannot live a lie .
there will always be this big , fat elephant ... in the room with us .
listen , peewee .
never tell him .
it' s time to go , sarah .
come on .
got everything ?
yes .
how you holding up ?
pussy' s a mess .
i' m just telling you right now .

we' re tired .
it' s fine .
it' s just that this is our wedding day ... and it' s something i fantasized about ... my whole life . [ organ plays " wedding march " ]
and now it' s over .

kinda .
oh , honey .
oh , my god .
tomorrow , my parents are gonna know ...

fredo ...
i need to know where that little signora is ... at all times .

grazie .
dodgers won . !
dodgers won . !
the dodgers won , honey .
see ...
i knew you were going to make me pay ... for watching the game .
no .
no , it' s not that .
we need to talk .
about what ?
have you always told me the truth ?
yeah .
except the time i told you ...
i liked your brother willie .
this is serious .
i am serious .
i really don' t like him .
marriage is built on honesty and trust .
i totally agree .
okay .
then did you ever do something ... that you wanted to tell me about ... but you couldn' t because you felt bad about it ?
and the more time went on ... the harder it got for you to tell me ?
and then it turned into this big , fat lie ... so you kept not telling me about it ...
did you talk to kyle ?
no .
why ?
no reason .
does kyle know something that i should know ?
no .
you covered your nose .
i had an itch .
you were hiding flared nostrils .
what do you have to tell ?
okay .
it' s just ... when bags died ... he didn' t exactly die ... the way that i described it .
him chasing those squawking pigeons off the balcony ?
yeah , that .
what happened ?
well ...
okay .
i' m reading my magazine ... and i' m really ...
i' m focusing ... and i' m really into it ... and along comes bags , you know ?
he comes trucking over ... and he starts tugging on my ankle .
and i was like , " bags . !
i' m ...
i' m ...
i was like ...
i think i even said , " i' m trying to focus .
like , don' t ...
and he looked up at me ... and he was giving me the look like ...
hey , are you gonna play with me or not ?
and i was like ...
i reallyjust want to read though , bags .
and ...
i' m ... and ... he started pulling on my ankle again .
so , i grabbed the ball ... and i was like , " go get it , buddy .
and i threw the ball over my shoulder ... and it went out the window ... and bags dove , and he died .
you killed bags ?
it was an accident .
and you lied about it all this time ?
actually , it was more of an omission .
no , it was more like a lie !
where are you going ?
i have to figure out what to do with this .
what does that mean ?
i can deal with you being cheap ... and i can deal with you being a shitty driver .
i cannot not deal with you being a liar !
whoa .
wait a second .
this whole thing started ... with you wanting to talk about something .
well , i don' t want to talk about it right now .
so you' re feeling guilty about something too .
yes , there is something i " omitted " that i don' t want to talk about right now .
you want a marriage based on trust and honesty ?
well , here' s your chance .
come on !
yeah , yeah , you got it . !
i can see it . !
bring it !
i slept with peter prentiss .

my parents were pressuring me to .

i was confused .
i' m in seattle .
he asked me out to dinner .
the champagne is flowing ...
please try not to break into song .
my feelings for you ... were very , very strong ... and i needed to know that they were real .
i wasn' t brought up ... to manage feelings like that very well .
yeah ... you had a real tough upbringing .
i need some air .
yeah ?

i couldn' t find you in the crowd .
that' s cool .
are you ready to go ?
uh ... yeah .

you were just doing the same thing with wendy .
you have no right to be angry .
you slut !
excuse me ?
you had your tongue down his throat .
i saw it out the window !
did you see me slap him , then ?
oh , don' t give me that .
some part of you wants him .
just say it !
fine .
i' m not gonna lie anymore .
certain things would be easier given his background ... and a small part of me thought ... that i wanted that once ...
a very small part .
why would you invite him on our honeymoon ?
i didn' t invite him .
i don' t know how he found us .
oh , yeah ?
oh , well , maybe it was magic .
no , peter must be a warlock .
that' s yours .
yeah , sure .
it matches perfect with my red leather panties !
okay .
i met a woman at a bar .
nothing happened .
you picked up a total stranger at a bar ... brought her back to our honeymoon suite ... and took off her disgusting red bra .
nothing happened .
i swear .
no , no , no .
the bra just jumped off her bare naked breasts .
no , no , no .
the bra just jumped off her bare naked breasts .
sarah ...
you sit there and make me feel guilty for a kiss ...
a kiss that i didn' t even want in the first place .
don' t tell me you didn' t want it .
you wanted it !
i could see from the balcony ... that you wanted it . !
i' m sorry !
oh , my god !
son of a beeyatch !
oh !
my skull is on fire !
oh !
okay !

what are you doing , tom ?
i think it' s time for peter and i to tangle !
see !
you have no future with this lunatic !
shut up , peter !
tom , you' re acting like a crazy person .
maybe it' s ' cause i just got hit in the head ... with a 10 pound ashtray !
i gotta warn you , leezak .
i studied karate with a chinese grand master .
yeah ?
well , i hope he showed you ... how to pull a fire poker outta your ass !
tom , put the poker down .
fredo , call the police !

you stay away from my wife !
wait .
wait .
stop .
that' s my husband .
please .
maybe they were right .
who ?
everyone .
they said that we were too young ... and that we needed to get to know each other better .
maybe they were right .
maybe love isn' t enough .
what' d he say ?
peter just bailed us out .
that' s ...
that' s just jim dandy .
forget it .
i' m going home .
yeah , me too !
passports , please .

i just don' t know if love is enough anymore .
what do you mean , " enough " ?
i mean ... even if sarah and i do love each other ... maybe we did need more time to get to know each other .
so ...
what you' re saying here is ... you had a couple of bad days in europe ... and ... it' s over .
time to grow up , tommy .
some days your mother and me loved each other .
other days we had to work at it .
you never see the hard days in a photo album ... but those are the ones ... that get you from one happy snapshot to the next .
i' m sorry your honeymoon stunk ... but that' s what you got dealt .
now you gotta work through it .
sarah doesn' t need a guy with a fat wallet ... to make her happy .
i saw how you love this girl .
how you two lit each other up .
she doesn' t need any more security than that .
thanks , dad .
