long ago in the reign of the king' s richard the lionheart .
there was a legend known to all .
that' s a man who stole from the rich to feed the poor
he was known throught out the reign .
as robin hood .
it is known that he and his band of merry men
played the evil share of nottingham .
and he romanced one heart of maid , marion .
there was more to their story .
a tale kept secret then forgotten .
lost in the maze of time and shifting memory .
for robin and marion , had a child .
what ?
you gave me the orders to inform you moment the child is born .
my lord ,
shall it be a price on the infant' s head my lord ?
equal to the price set on its father .
robin hood shall not have a son .
to play the nottingham .
oh , the child is female ...
not a son ?
are you sure is a daughter ?
shall it be a price on the infant' s head my lord ?
a girl ...
gwyneth ,

she' il be safe here , i' il promise .
how can i choose to you if you don' t study ?

i' m only stable because each cruises he said it could be his last
would you have your father refuses his king .

i do love him but he' s like my brother but ...
uncle , i have to let him win at the archer just to spare him .
how can i think of him as a husband ?
lf he pleases your father ?
i can' t get his pleasure or its opposite .

but how do we measure it ?
i can count his visits from one hand ,

tuck said i should be beg pardon to my father for the way i' ve spoke .
we shouldn' t be fighting each together ...
but fighting together .
side by side against king john , why can' t he see !
i must do something , i will die before i' ve lives .
do you ever feel that ?
yes ...
what stops you ? ... i' m a coward .
he said that life is like a wild horse .
you ride it or its ride you .
suppose the wild horse doesn' t want to be ridden .
are you after your destiny or slate your fear ?
a man who doen' t afraid of the wild creature is probably a fool .
i don' t want to be afraid of anything ...
it is all arranged madam .
prince john' s army will be waiting at harwich .
philip will be murder the minute he comes to shore .
prince john promised to pay my travel expenses .

wear it for my sake .
alright .
lf you were ill , who will look after me ?
i don' t feel the cold .
i don' t feel much of anything right now .
not cold ... not hunger ... ... not even fear .
as if i' m dreaming .
or in my grave i wish to see my father before i die .
what could he tell me ?
look at you conrad ,
victory rules .
controls the surrounding , fields and woods .
for all we know , let me be here ready for hiding .
will we find him .
any signs of robin ?
all the main roads are being watched .
he doesn' t travel on main road !

like one of his arrows .
look at the cabbages ...
the eggs ...
i should see you in prison !
how dare you ?
i am sick of you !
your wife is baron .
a man who punished a hundred child has none of own .
tell the god , the boy is a thief .

for the benedict has arranged a meeting at the back gate of harwich .
but how do we know is robin hood ?
mortal loves is but licking honey from the thorns
then he must replied ,
it is insolitude that marry is cumulated .
pretty thoughts , but i can' t agree .
licking love honey no matter the danger ?
ls more then a emtpy bed on a cold night .
you are a philosopher conrad .
no sir , i' m a lover .
i would trade food for love even if i was starving .
i have known a lots of women .

froderick stop it !
sorry .
these are good ...
but you shouldn' t steal .
oh i see ,
your moral rises but your stomach failed .
no shame leaving it for the bird .
they taxes the poor until they can' t feed their own children
and jailed them for stealing .
john' s a thief , not them .
not me .
you could have ended up in prison .
my father stole from the rich and gave to the poor .
no prisons can' t hold him .
you can never be like your father .
i didn' t expected .
lf i were , would you like me better ?

we split up , so i can get away .
i don' t understand , why are you running from those men ?

and altogether he was too fat and the children were hungrey .
a thief ?
many thanks girl .
you took the guards from their post and gave us ...
well ... there' s no help now .

the different of look of richard around the mouth
oh god ... the thing i forced to do ...

do i have to spelt it out to you ?
do i have to write it down ?
i' m surrounding by idiots !
i made one simple request !
kill one prince !
possible !
must i have to do everything ?
i when to nottingham for myself
where is philip ?
does he mean the young philip or the old philip ...
i haven' t seen it either .
i' il have your heads on the steak !
maybe ... he means philip the map maker .
philip the map maker ... no ...
that' s not the one you meant it is ?
i mean philip the son of my brother !
what does he look like ?
prepare the rag .
yes .
he' s still alive ,
i' m in nottingham ls best we part here
i' m on the king buisness .
the king employed you to steal horses ?
he employed a man to protect his son philip .
i' m afraid that man is in prison .
lf you are talking about robin hood , let him be there .
he has betrayed his king and plotted philip' s death .
may god strike you down for repeated such a lie !
he let the prince into a trap this very day !
not robin hood !
you might believe me !
not with my own eyes .
i watched with my eyes
i saw robin hood taken prisoner !
and who are you pretending to know philip !
conrad , i was the prince' s valet .
what ?
no !
john will act as a king will hang robin hood and scarlett .
we have to get them out of prison .
conrad say you help me please !
a woman dressed as a man ?
and me ...
prince' s valet against john' s army ?
you are frighten ?
better alive coward than a dead fool !
you don' t understand .
robin hood is my father .
he won' t kill us yet until he found the boy .
or john is wearing the crown .
the only way is wait for news of king richard death .
it wasn' t gwyn' s fault rob .
we walked into it .
she' s a good girl .
i know .
we should have brought her along .
i should have say yes .
she was right .
i should have told her that .
i ordered philip dead !
did i get philip dead ?
i did not !
that was my honest mistake my lord .
honest mistake ?
honest mistake ?
my life is in danger and you took a honest mistake ?

what did i wanted ?
philip sir .

philip .
philip good !
ride to nottingham , inform your sheriff .
lf he doesn' t send me philip' s head .
i' il have his .
and yours ... on a plate !
well , two heads are better than one .
philip' s death will be a great blown for his people .
the people don' t love john .
he' s move by greed and treat the subject like sheets of slaughter
surely one king is as good as a mix .
philip care nothing for the fair of state .
he only thought of wine and dancing .
believe me , england is better off .
you know nothing of life here you would' t say that .
i rather have a fool than john .
don' t mistake me , philip was not a fool .
ln fact he was quite the opposite .
he was a quick wit according to some .
he find favour with women and he was a fine sword man .
not average or not a bad fellow .
but no desire for a public life .
a child can prefer ...
a prince has no obligation to serve the people .
here archer ,
lf you don' t hurry you won' t make the tournament .
look at you , a woman and you preferred to be a man .
why shouldn' t a prince take your part ...
archery tournament .

gwyn you must eat .

philip was chosen by richard , who was a good ruler .
lf he was alive he would have brought peace to england .
i know it .
why do you stare ?
do you always wear men' s clothes ?
no , of course not .
it just i wanted to ride with my father .
keeping me safe .
he was alway at war .
as i child i hated it .
i think it' s because i longed for him .
where is he now ?
he' s dying .
conrad i' m so sorry .
philip was very lucky to have a friend like you .
gwyn what did he say ?
nothing .
i don' t trust him .

i come here trying to makes friend .
straight him until he talks .
philip is alive .
philip lives , tell everyone .

they must double the guard around the tower .
a girl and a handful of monks , my lord ?
you don' t trap for a bear when catching a mouse
you didn' t see this mouse .
spliting image of her father .
his skills ... and the disrespect of the lord .
she will know fear and death .
i' il teach her both !
but first philip must die .

i can' t bear it when we are not friend .
i am sorry , i was wrong .
you were hurt , conrad is right ?
conrad ?
yes ?
now don' t pretend , i know you like him .
stop it ?
what ?
you like him don' t deny it .
i know you better than you know yourself .
you say so .
it doen' t matter .
i told him not to think of me as a woman and he obey me very well .
so let' s that be the end of it .
i' ve seen the way he looks at you and believe me ...
he sees you as a woman .
what ?
maybe he believes that you also in love of someone esle .
i didn' t exactly told him the truth .
oh froderick , i' m sorry .
i' m always apologising to you .
maybe that' s the problem .
would you like me better if i just grab you ?
threw you down and kiss you from head to toe ?

i' m your best friend aren' t we ?
are you afraid ?
aren' t you ?
their army are well trained and we aren' t .
my father said there' re no courage about fear .
these people are the ones with courage .
to rise each morning to face the lost of their land .
to see the children hungrey .
their lives stock stolen .
and they don' t give up .

lf conrad say philip dead , he' s dead
and everything else is a lie !

philip thought if people believes he was dead ,

my lord , 50 pieces the bull eye should be easy for you .
and an end for robin hood .

i am philip , son of richard the lionheart .
i was chosen by him as the successer .
as prove ,
here is the ring given to me by my father .
your father the absented king richard' s son ?
i will wear the crown .
i am rightful air by blood .
i am the rightful king !
by lord !
there are higher lord for men like you .
you could never be king .
i have seen what your army and your tax men has done to the villages
they are suffering from your production of greed and your fear .
how dare you !
you draw a sword against your king .
arrest this man !
arrest him !
step forward and defend your king .
i command it !
why aren' t you move ?
you define me for him !

it' s over !
the people won' t do what you asked .
cos they won' t fight for you anymore .
your days is at and end .
give me my father' s crown sir .
this is ridiculous .
history will ignore you .
i' m at your service , your majesty .
did froderick tell you ,
that i' ve made him a member at my castle ?
he' s off learning spanish to improve foreign relation .
he' s very happy .
winfred of lancaster , i hardly know you .
you will be king and i am a commoner .
i will not take the throne .
they will despite you if you did .
i would despite myself .
your highness ,
come , before they speak lattin and pour oil on my head ...
let' s us be it once more .
even if it only for an hour .
or a minute .
one minute .
ls not fair .
the king should have everything he wants .
that' s what i used to say when my father goes off the war .
ls not fair ,
why does he loves richard more than his own daughter .
i didn' t understand ,
it wasn' t richard he loves , it was something much bigger ...
something held inside himself , like a priest carrying its faith .
what i decided , i don' t want to be a cause on another man pain
which is why ...
i will serve you like my father served your father .
from this day forward and forever ...
yes , your majesty .
say it , please ...
from this day forward and forever .
good day , miss lockely .
good day , yours highness .
i was wondered where you were .
froderick said i' il find you in here .
ls a quite place to think .
never had much quite in my life .
you mother fell in love with a robber and a thief .
princess just as bad if not wrost .
look at me gwyn ,
look at me .
i did what i thought was right .
i kept away , and i let you grow up alone
because i want to protect you from the life that i lead .
ls nothing wrong with the life you lead .
no there isn' t ... for me .
i wanted something better for you .
ln the end it didn' t makes any different did it ?
you grew up to be just like me anyway .
so i' m not saying we' il start again but just ..
start ... partners .
you know father umm ... ... daughter .
on condition though , you' il take orders from me .
i promise .
we' il serve the king together .
i know .
history may have forgotten the reign of philip
and the richard of lionheart .
but this much is known , that philip never marry .
he pledged his heart to a woman of no birth right .
the daughter of a thief and a lady ...
a common woman of uncommon value ...
she was called gwyn .
