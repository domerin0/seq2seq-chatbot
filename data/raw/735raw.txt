everyone , please take your seats .
you heard the bell .
you know what it means .
last week , the assignment was to write an essay about your family .
who they ...
are !
and what they ... mean to us !
excellent droning .
so i want everyone to take out their essays .
we' re going to read them aloud to the class right up here .
my mom says that me and my dad have very healthy appetites .
my mom and dad are very religious .
when they' re in their bedroom at night , i always hear them yelling , " jesus !
my mom says my dad' s eyes are brown because he is so full of sh ... brian !
my brother jack is in eighth grade .
he told me to ask my dad who he voted for ... for ... for president .
i did and my dad said he' s a total bush man .
that made my brother laugh really hard .
whenever my uncle stu comes over to play pool with my dad , my mom says the basement smells like a cheech and chong movie .
well ... it' s like this .
my dog ate my paper .
i checked , but he didn' t poop it out .
what a lovely sentiment , mr. etheridge .
maybe your dog can eat the zero you' il be receiving too .
aw , man !
harsh .
miss trinke ?
it' s your turn now .
new jersey ... and new york .
my dad was a jersey boy who became the youngest and most successful music publicist in new york city .
by the time he was 27 , he had 100 people working for him .
and even though they all loved him , he loved them even more .
my fellow flacks and spin doctors .
salud .
daddy loved his job , but not as much as he loved my mom .
mommy was a book editor in new york city when her and daddy met .
daddy said theirjobs were kind of the same ... they made slight corrections for their clients .
because george michael is a pimp who is all about the ladies , my friend .
come on , " i want your sex " ?
that sound like he' s singing to a guy ?
daddy worked so much that sometimes mommy could only see him late at night .
daddy says that' s why they both loved the city so much it never went to sleep .
and neither did him and mommy .
but after a year of romance in new york city ,
daddy said it was time to show mommy where he came from .
introducing her to my pop .
hey , how are ya ?
how' re ya doin ' ?
how' re ya doin ' yourself ?
this is gertrude .
hi .
merry christmas .
and what do you do , mr. trinke ?
easy on the " mr. trinke " .
it' s bart.
i work for the borough , for 30 years now .
he' s the only man in highlands licensed to operate the street sweeper .
oh , man , i always wanted to ride in one of those things .
well , you continue seeing my son , i can probably get you a turn at the wheel .
i was only gonna sleep with him a few more times and then dump him , but now , after an offer like that ...
holy shit .
listen to the mouth on this one !
oh , yeah , they don' t make ' em like mom anymore , do they , dad ?
now , listen , i' m goin ' to the bar .
what a shock .
lf you guys are gonna do anything while i' m gone , stay the hell off of my bed .
you' re going to a bar ?
didn' t he tell ya ?
i' m an alcoholic .
well , i wanna go to the bar too .
no , you don' t wanna go to this bar .
it' s a bunch of old guys talkin ' about how good they had it under kennedy .
the man was a goddamn saint .
i' m goin ' to the bar with your dad .
you can come if you want .
no , that' s ok .
i' il stay here and do the dishes .
i only cooked .
why shouldn' t i clean ?
suit yourself .
but don' t wash that pan .
i got a layer of juice built up for the pork roll , and i don' t want you scrubbin ' it off .
that " juice " is called grease , dad .
it' s bad for you .
it clogs your arteries .
it' s called juice .
and it greases a father' s insides so that he can better swallow the shit his son feeds him twice a year when he can be bothered coming to visit him .
so that night , daddy took mommy to pop' s bar , where she got to meet pop' s other children , his best friends greenie and block .
hey , your kid' s cuttin ' a rug .
who are you , connie chung ?
daddy said , because mommy survived her first trip to jersey , he knew she was a keeper .
he said they celebrated their engagement by going out for pizza .
and that' s how i got here .
do we have enough of these at home , or should i steal some ?
lf you' re gonna steal something , steal some rubber gloves .
thank you !
you' re welcome !
and with that , everyone lived happily ever after .
almost .
look , you' ve got two minutes , and then we have to go , ok ?
or i' m gonna leave .
would you stop rushing me ?
i don' t understand how somebody who had all day sitting around to get ready waits till 20 minutes before we have to leave !
you try getting anything accomplished with this big gut in your way !
this is one of the few days of the year that i can be fired for being late !
anytime that you wanna carry this baby , ollie , you let me know !
ok ?
i would be glad to go back to wearing regular dresses instead of this tent !
the dress looks fine .
it' s gorgeous , ok ?
it' s beautiful .
yeah , until i' m standing next to janet jackson or sheryl crow .
then you' il see how not fine it looks .
gertie , i asked you , please , to use your own brush , ok ?
can you just not use my brush ?
don' t start .
it' s just that every time i wanna comb my hair
i spend 1 5 minutes taking these long , bushy hairs out of my brush .
and i mean , you ask me to ...
i' m sorry .
baby , i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
you don' t understand what it' s like to be this fat !
i' ve always been thin , and now i' m a disgusting pig !
and it' s my first time going to the video music awards and all the other girls are gonna be skinny , and i' m gonna look like a whale !
baby , baby , they' re just skinny ' cause they' re all coked out whores .
i wanna be a coked out whore !
ok , you can be a coked out whore too .
you can be a coked out , coked out whore .
i' m sorry .
i should be more sensitive .
i' m sorry .
i should be more sensitive , honey .
i know .
yes .
i know .
baby , we have to go now , ok ?
ok .
i love you .
we have to go now .
ok .
i love you too .
all right , let' s go .
ok ?
just give me two minutes .
what time is it ?
20 after .
she' s gonna kill me !
i need the quote for the madonna release .
ok .
madonna trusts the public will judge for itself that ... this latest in a long line of breakthrough music videos is not the tasteless sexploitation it' s accused of being .
" it' s artistic expression .
of what ?
of one woman' s constant need to show the world ... her labia .
hey , can i use the word " labia " in a press release ?
see you next week .
one of these days , i' il get me one of those husbands that show up for lamaze .
i' m sorry , babe .
it was madonna .
so you were late because of another woman .
that' s nice .
come on .
i still gotta do my job .
and i still gotta do mine too .
but i was at lamaze on time .
look , all i' m saying is that guy who used to spend all night at the office and barely live in his apartment ?
that' s not you anymore .
now you have to be the guy who' s done by six and comes home and hangs out with his family .
that' s the only way we' re gonna work .
ok ?
ok .

first of all , take your hands off my uniform .
and second , i' m gonna need a patient here .

i' m calm .
we think gertie had an aneurysm .
ls she ok ?
we lost her , ollie .
the strain of the contractions and the pushing caused the aneurysm to rupture .
there are rarely symptoms for aneurysms ... _ i drew a picture of you _ you and your anchor tattoo
_ and saw the face that i knew _ covered in shame
_ you drew the bird that was here
_ the kind of sweet chanticleer
_ but with a terrible fear _ that the cage couldn' t tame
_ that' s how i knew the story would break my heart _ when you' re older _ that' s how i knew the story would break my heart
you sure you' re ok with this , dad ?
what , ok ?
she' s my granddaughter .
yeah , you can stay with me anytime , can' t you ?
yes , you can .
until you' re a teenager , with the boys and a reefer .
then i don' t wanna know about you .
i wouldn' t impose on you , you know .
i just got a lot of work ... piled up from before and ...
i' il be back late tonight , ok ?
yeah , take your time .
your daddy really misses your mommy , kid .

we won' t be here too long , dad .
we' il be out of your hair as soon as i get another job .
i have some feelers out to the other firms right now .
as soon as this whole thing blows over ...
it' s ok to stay here as long as you need to , till you get back on your feet .
i appreciate that .
on one condition .
here we go .
you put the kid to bed every night .
that' s it ?
for starters .
and no whores .
i don' t want no whores in my house .
i' m not really a whoremonger , dad .
here , the kid gets this .
that' s cute .
8 : 00 , you both get a bottle .
just shut the hell up and go be a father , would ya , please ?
no ?
yeah , this is only temporary , us ... you know ...
living with your grandfather here .
so ... how about that fresh prince thing , huh ?
it was quite a show .
your dad' s one big horse' s ass .
daddy' s ex bosses said the guys who did pr for hitler have a better chance of working in this business again than daddy does .
so , ok ...
how' re you doin ' ?
yeah ...
you know , you kinda look like your mom .
like a squishier , balder version of your mom .
man ...
i just wish you could' ve gotten to meet your mom .
i know she wanted to meet you ... in a big , bad way .
ln a big , bad way .
sometimes , daddy wishes he' d have died instead of mommy .
because mommy never would' ve ...
let work get in the way of ... getting to know you ,
like daddy has for the last ... month or so .
it' s just that daddy ... he didn' t expect mommy ...
to leave the way she did .
it' s just really hard on daddy , who' s been trying to fill up his days with work , so he wouldn' t have to think about mommy never being around again .
i just loved your mom so much .
you know ?
she really lit my world on fire .
when that happens ... you kinda think it' il go on like that until one of you dies .
you know ?
you just don' t expect ...
i miss her so much .
so , so much .
and you' re a little piece of mommy .
and that makes you really special to daddy .
just don' t go anywhere .
' cause you' re the next best thing to mommy , and i love you so much .
and i' il always be here for you .
and i' m sorry about the way i' ve been acting .
i promise you ...
i' il be better now .
i' m gonna be the best daddy in the world .
' cause that' s what mommy wanted .
and that' s what you deserve .
and that' s all i am now .
i' m just your dad .
your dad likes to run off at the mouth sometimes , i know .
your mother wasn' t a fan , either .
you wanna see a picture of your mom ?
i have one .
this was your mommy .
she was really pretty .
ok .
you can keep it .
daddy' s got a bunch .
there you go .
goodnight , gertie .
_ worlds ... _ they rise and fall
gertie ! _ within her eyes
your chariot awaits , princess .
let' s go !
we gotta go !
argh ! _ to fly in the sky
how was school , good ?
mm hm .

yep .
remember to put your seat belt on ?
know where to find it ?
yep .
lock and load .
comin ' around .
get ready .
ready ?
punch it , chewy !
can we go see cats ?
absolutely not .
why ?
cats was the second worst thing that ever happened to new york city .
besides , cats closed three years ago .
we never do anything cool .
you' re ridin ' in the batmobile , aren' t ya ?
how cool is that ?
oh , my god .
look , no one' s more depressed than me that driving the street sweeper is considered the height of excitement in my life .
i used to live in new york city .
i could' ve gone to see cats three times a day .
it' s not like i ever ask for anything .
oh ho ho !
and the oscar goes to gertie trinke , for her performance in laying it on thick for my old man .
what is it with you and cats all of a sudden ?
i wanna sing a cats song in the big show , like everybody else .
what big show ?
there' s gonna be this big show at school .
all the people have to sing a song with people from their family .
are you inviting me to this big show ?
duh !
yeah , you and pop too .
oh ho !
i' m sure that' il go over huge with your pop .
can uncle greenie and uncle block be in it too ?
those men are not your uncles .
they' re barely even your peers .
pee ers ?
when is this big show ?
right before thanksgiving break .
does it have to be something from the bible ?
i don' t think so .
ls cats in the bible ?
the satanic bible , yes .
what ?
when you taking her to see the cats ?
jesus , you too ?
gertie !
do you even know what cats is , dad ?
what , i don' t read the papers ?
you don' t read that paper .
what are you doing with a new york times ?
they ran out of the ledger .
they don' t have the jumble in the times , dad .
shit .
where were you ?
i was in the bathroom .
why didn' t i hear the toilet flush ?
oh .
i forgot .
ok , march your butt back upstairs and flush that toilet .
and when i say no about something ,
like , i don' t know , cats , maybe , i mean no .
ok ?
pop , you were supposed to be subtle !
why do you teach her words like that ?
you' re gonna have to mow the park for me tomorrow .
i can' t do it .
why the hell not ?
i have an appointment in the city at 1 1 : 00 .
jesus , kid , why do you keep doin ' it to yourself ?
how many of these interviews you gotta go on before you get it through your thick head they don' t want you in that business anymore ?
for christ' s sakes , you made fun of that prince charles guy .
thank you .
first of all , dad , i didn' t " make fun " of anybody .
i made one remark about will smith , the fresh prince .
sooner or later , everyone' s gonna forget about that and i' m gonna go back to doing what i' m really good at , instead of sweeping streets and plowing snow and picking up garbage .
ok ?
lf you' re going into the city anyway , at least take the kid to see the cats .
oh , god ...
i' il tell you what , since there is no more cats ,
gertie , why don' t you come over here and pick out another play that you wanna see ?
look through here .
anything you want .
go nuts .
cats is a show ?
yeah , you read the papers .
you think you' re slick , don' t ya , young lady ?
next time you' re lookin ' for a partner in crime , you' re gonna have to aim higher than your grandfather .
he' s soft in the head .
i heard that !
here .
can we go see this show ?
sweeney todd ?
do you know that this has a lot of singing ?
it' s still a play .
ok .
i' m just checking .
your dad one time lost a bet with someone at his work , and he had to go see a singing play , done by people on roller skates .
cool !
your dad didn' t think so .
i handled primarily recording artists but when i initially trained , i trained in film pr , so i can do that too .
i , uh ... took the last six or seven years off .
i was raising my daughter in new jersey .
but i kept abreast , so ...
i' m pretty comfortable jumping back in .
what else can i tell you guys ?
uh ...
that' s it .
i can start , you know , right away .
you guys all right ?
are you the ollie trinke ?
the one who used to work at mandellkirschner ?
yeah .
son of a bitch !
yes !
i told you , reynolds !
pay up !
i got it .
am i missin ' somethin ' ?
nah , nah , he just bet me you were the ollie trinke , the one who pulled " the fresh prince " .
they named it ?
of course !
are you kidding ?
you' re a legend , man !
you did what every flack only dreams about doing !
which was what ?
you went apeshit !
you trashed your client back to the stone age .
yeah .
we bow to you , man .
you' re like a god around here .
yep , exactly .

so they wouldn' t give you a job , huh ?
no .
but apparently , daddy' s a legend .
you don' t need that job anyway .
you already got a job .
yes , well , daddy used to have a job where a nightly shower was an option , not a necessity .
you know what job you should do ?
what' s that ?
you should be a dance teacher , like johnny in dirty dancing .
i should ?
should i say , " nobody puts baby in a corner " ?
oh , can we rent dirty dancing again ?
ohh ...
dirty dancing ranks one notch below cats in my book .
can you pick out something else ?
can we rent this ?
absolutely not .
go pick out something from the children' s section .
all those movies suck .
watch your language .
nah , that' s ...
no , i guess that' s it .
yep , yep , that' s it .
i' il just take this and whatever the kid' s getting .
just go ahead and put it in the bag .
i' m all set .
it' s good .
bi bi guys , featuring curious jordie " ?
lnteresting choice .
does the wife know you' re looking into your options ?
it' s ...
i got the ...
i got the wrong box by accident .
oh , right .
would you mind , uh ... exchanging that for me for something ... anything you can get your hands on that' s , you know ...
so , then you want something ...
... that' s non bi .
can i have your membership card , please ?
yeah , sure .
do you mind if i asked you a few questions about your renting practices ?
uh ... sure .
really ?
uh ...
do you always rent adult titles with your daughter in tow , or is this the first time ?
excuse me ?
when you rent porn , do you usually do it with family around , or is this like a , you know , special occasion ?
do i have to answer this ?
i' m a grad student , writing a thesis paper .
the family man and the pornographic fixation " .
ok .
i would rather not take part .
really ?
frank , is bi bi guys a one or a two night rental ?
what are you getting , daddy ?
yeah , daddy .
let' s just take a look ...
let' s not , ok ?
would you mind not asking me those questions when my daughter' s with me ?
how about when you bring these back ?
that' s ...
yeah .
ln an effort to get honest feedback , leave the kid and the wife at home .
my mom' s dead .
she died when i was born .
oh , jesus .
man , i' m sorry .
i didn' t ...
no , you didn' t .
let' s go .
i' m sorry .
do i have to ?
major damage didn' t have to go to bed when he fought the tiki terrors !
melvin !
and do they ...
i' il get it .
you will not .
you' re not even supposed to be up this late .
watch your video .
but , mom !
say , " ok , mom .
ahh !
say , " ok , mom .
hi .
hey !
you' re the lady from the video store .
let' s not use that term too loosely , ok ?
go back and watch your video .
yes ?
i just wanted to come here and tell you that i' m really sorry about earlier tonight .
i feel like shit about what i said and your daughter and everything .
well ... you should .
you know that kid was crying in the car the whole way home ?
oh , no ...
no , i wasn' t .
get back inside and watch your video !
nice !
real nice .
see , now you have to let me interview you for my paper .
ls that why you' re here ?
i just think you' d make one hell of an interesting case study .
the sympathetic widower who doesn' t have time to date ' cause he' s raising a kid , so he rents porn instead .
i mean , i think that' s very interesting stuff .
jesus christ !
you' ve got some nerve , lady .
and besides , i' d really like to make it up to you .
for what i said , and for embarrassing you before that .
you' re really having a banner evening .
you' re batting a thousand tonight .
you' re ollie , right ?
i' m maya harding .
hi , maya .
nice to meet you .
hi .
come on , why don' t you let me take you out one day this week ?
you do eat lunch when you' re not knee deep in adult movies , right ?
i appreciate it , but , uh ... no thanks .
ollie , come on , you' re ruining my karma level here .
what , buying me one lunch is gonna square you with krishna ?
hare hare !
ls monday ok ?
sound good ?
i mean , i was thinking nothing fancy .
i was thinking maybe , like , the diner .
around noon ?
no !
noon it is !
oh ...
see you there .
bye !
an incredibly strange woman .
i did not hear the toilet flush .
thank you .
can we get popcorn ?
this isn' t the movies , sweetheart .
they don' t sell popcorn here .
this is broadway .
this is class . _ and if you' re beautiful _ what then ? _ with yellow hair like wheat _ i think we shall not meet again , my little dove _ my sweet johanna
_ goodbye , johanna _ you' re gone and yet you' re mine _ i' m fine , johanna _ i' m fine ok .
you see that floor .
now look three windows in from the right .
see that window ?
that' s where we used to live before we lived with pop .
we' d still live there if we lived in the city .
lf mommy was still alive ?
yep .
dad ...
yes ?
do you miss mommy ?
i do .
every day .
what was she like ?
i' ve told you a million times .
i know , but i forget .
no , i don' t think you forget .
i think you just like to hear me tell you .
which is ok .
it' s all right .
you can ask about your mommy as much as you want .
so tell me already .
well , she was pushy , like you were right there .
she was beautiful , like you are right now .
and she was ... smart ... and strong , like you' il grow up to be one day .
i' m smart now .
i know .
i wasn' t impugning your intelligence or anything .
what' s " impugning " mean ?
oh , not so smart now , are you ?
that' s a big word .
yes , you' re right , it is .
let' s see .
to impugn means to criticize .
so ...
pop' s always impugning you , right ?
well , he thinks he is .
but he' s just talking to make sure he' s still alive .
pop is a very , very old man .
what do you think ?
you like the city ?
it' s ok .
but i like highlands better .
you do ?
yeah .
my school' s there , and my friends ...
and we can rent movies there .
well , if memory serves , you can rent movies here too .
yeah , but not from that pretty lady at the video store .
oh , you think she' s pretty , do you ?
don' t you ?
lsn' t that why you' re taking her on a date ?
it' s not a date .
the only girl i take on dates is you , ok ?
this is a date .
we' re on a date .
we are ?
mm hm .
it doesn' t feel like a date .
it doesn' t ?
well , i can fix that .
sir !
how often do you rent adult movies ?
do i really have to do this ?
you have nothing to be ashamed about .
lnterest in adult film can be healthy , as long as it' s not habitual .
so come on , how often ?
three or four times a week .
ok , maybe i was wrong .
you should be ashamed .
you have a real talent for making the subject feel open and comfortable in a safe environment .
so you' re renting it presumably to masturbate to , right ?
good god !
come on , don' t be such a tight ass .
we' re all adults here .
i know i' m an adult .
how old are you , exactly ?
i' il be 26 in march .
26 ?
you still haven' t learned some things aren' t polite to talk about in public ?
lf it makes you feel any better , i do it , like , twice a day .
good god !
what can i tell ya ?
i get bored easily .
you' re gonna get carpal tunnel syndrome .
don' t get all judgmental with me .
you' re no slouch yourself .
well , no , i ...
i just have a healthy sexual appetite .
why don' t you go out and get yourself a boyfriend ?
why don' t you just go out and get yourself a girlfriend ?
i work all day , i hang out with my kid all night .
so you' d rather hang out with your kid than get laid ?
yeah .
aw ... that' s kinda sweet .
i' m kinda crushin ' on you right now , trinke .
ok .
can i go home now ?
no .
when was the last time you had sex ?
i would rather not disclose that information .
oh , come on , don' t clam up on me now .
you' re gonna remain anonymous in my paper .
ha !
anonymity doesn' t concern me .
embarrassment does .
why would you be embarrassed ?
because it' s been a long time .
how long ?
a long time .
come on , champ .
own it .
just put it out there .
i swear i won' t make any editorial cracks about it .
not in front of you , at least .
seven years .
seven years ?
since my wife died , yeah .
you know , a dumbfounded , mouth agape look of shock might be construed by some as an editorial crack too .
i' m sorry .
it' s ok .
it' s fine .
no , it' s not .
i mean , it' s not at all .
with all due respect to your wife , you' ve gotta get back on the horse , man .
no , i don' t , actually .
yes , you do .
no , i don' t .
yes , you ...
get up .
are we done ?
with this , for now .
but come with me .
lord have mercy .
where are we going ?
to your place .
we' re gonna have some sex .
what , did you forget something ?
no .
look , i appreciate the offer .
i' m very flattered .
but i can' t do this .
what' s the matter ?
don' t you think i' m cute ?
of course i think you' re cute .
well , then ?
look , i' m not just celibate because of my daughter .
there are a lot of emotional issues in it too .
i mean , my wife may be dead .
i' m still very much in love with her .
hey , i respect that .
i' m not telling you to fall in love with me here , and i' m not trying to replace your wife .
i' m just talking about two consenting adults having some casual sex .
probably some really short casual sex , with you being a little out of practice .
i can' t do it , i' m sorry .
what are you , a monk ?
god !
let' s look at this logically , ok ?
you rent porn and touch yourself , right ?
would you lower your voice ?
lf you' re not sweating how your wife would feel about you and porn , then you shouldn' t sweat what i' m proposing ' cause it' s the same thing .
only somebody else is doing the touching and you' re saving a $2 rental fee .
come on , stud .
man cannot live on porn alone .
oh , god ...
i' m home !
pop ? !
oh , my god ...
what do i do ?
get in the bathroom !
pop ?
uh , no , honey , it' s me .
daddy ?
why aren' t you at work ?
uh , because i had to come home and do ...
i had to ... come home and take a shower .
can we rent a movie ?
yeah , sure , sure , sure .
as soon as i get done up here and dry off , i' il come down .
ok .
oh , my god .
that was so close .
what do we do now ?
i' m wet .
sorry , dad , i forgot again .
shh !
hi , honey .
you remember maya .
from the video store .
what are your intentions ?
excuse me ?
what are your intentions with my father ?
like , do you plan on marrying him ?
uh ...
i don' t ...
because i was taught that only married girls show their girl parts to boys .
right , daddy ?
uh ... right .
yes .
mm hm .
can we rent all the movies we want for free ?
what ?
can we rent all the movies we want for free ?
yes !
yes , yes .
for god' s sake , yes .
lf it means we' re not , you know , that we' re not in trouble anymore .
and ...
right , maya ?
yes !
uh ... whatever you want .
it' s on the house .
even dirty dancing ?
yeah .
and we can do sweeney todd for the show at school ?
what ?
we can do sweeney todd for the show at school ?
no , honey , that' s too grown up .
really ?
oh man , what am i gonna tell pop about you guys ?
fine .
we can do sweeney todd for the show at school .
ok !
would you shut the hell up already ?
christ , greenie , you' re always ...
oh , jesus .
oh !
christ almighty .
you wearin ' a ... wearin ' a towel ?
just as long as you didn' t do it on my bed .
oh , jesus christ , it was one time in high school !
you wanna let it go already ?
i banged a broad in my parents ' bed once .
it was nice .
terrific .
just so you know , we didn' t " bang " .
what , did ya get to third base ?
no !
not that it' s any of your business , but we didn' t do anything .
we lost our heads for a second , then cooler heads prevailed and we stopped before we did anything we' d both regret .
the kid busted in on ' em .
oh .
let' s talk about something else for a second , like this water main .
how bad is it ?
definitely needs to be replaced .
jesus christ . lf we gotta shut down bay avenue for that , this town is gonna throw a shit fit .
i' m sure .
hey , kid , you haven' t had to inconvenience the taxpayers on the job yet .
they get like animals .
remember back in ' 88 ?
south peak street .
holy shit , i thought they were gonna crucify us upside down .
like st peter .
who are you , the holy father ?
everybody knows i meant st peter .
you don' t have to explain my shit .
i' m just saying ...
when i was down there , how many cars did you wave around ?
three or four .
three or four cars for the whole half hour i was down there ?
well , it was rush hour .
yeah , i don' t think the legion of commuters in the highlands of new jersey are gonna object to us closing down a small portion of bay avenue for a few days .
one at a time , please !
one at a time !
we' re doing the best we can .
you were saying ?
why doesn' t somebody just go up there and explain to them what' s happening ?
why don' t you do it , daddy ?
wasn' t that your old job ?
making people like singers by saying nice things about ' em ?
yes , baby , but ...
no , the kid' s got a point there .
as a guy who used to sling bullshit for a living ,
i nominate you to go up there and say something .
oh , you do , huh ?
yeah .
it can' t hurt .
go ahead .
thanks , pop .
control yourselves !
he' s goin ' up there .
folks , one second .
please .
folks .
my name' s oliver trinke and i' m with the borough .
so i guess that makes me the least popular guy in the room .
i want to assure you that , uh ... this bay avenue job will be a very minimal inconvenience .
it' il only take three days at the most .
bullshit !
bullshit !
folks , a little decorum !
a little decorum !
folks , one second .
i just have one more thing that i just want to add .
i live in this town .
i see you guys headin ' to work every day .
i' m telling you , it was amazing !
and i get up there and i weave this web of bullshit so profoundly mesmerizing ,
i turn the entire place around !
you silver tongued devil , you .
everything i was saying was just right on the money , you know ?
maybe that' s ' cause you weren' t actually slinging as much bullshit as you thought .
get out there and play in the dirt " ?
i mean , what ...
i made that up !
sounds pretty good to me .
hey , gert .
the sad thing is , i had a greater sense of accomplishment from the water main thing than anything else i' ve done in the past seven years .
i get it .
i mean , you set out to do something and you did it .
so you feel drunk with power now .
makes sense .
that' s just it .
i was the youngest flack ever put in charge of its entire division ... ... in the history of mandellkirschner .
i know .
that' s an accomplishment .
convincing a town to approve something that' s already in their best interest ?
that' s just delayed common sense .
yeah , but that' s your life now .
i mean , being the youngest flack in the history of blah , blah , blah ... that' s not you anymore .
i mean , that might never have been you .
oh , it was me .
it was me with my own apartment , me richer , me with more self respect .
like it or not , this is you .
i mean , forget about what you thought you were and just accept who you are .
i guess i' il just get this .
gert , what are you doing ?
i distinctly remember your father telling you you could get dirty dancing .
oh , yeah !
he did !
yeah .
thanks for that , by the way .
lncidentally , she' s been asking me when she' s gonna grow boobies like yours .
oh , my god !
she' s seven , ok ?
lf you want , i can give her the old " boobie " talk my mom gave me when i was a kid .
does that talk include using the word " knockers " ?
i' m glad there' s no , you know , awkwardness between us .
after the ... well , the thing that happened last week with ...
ollie , i was gonna give you a mercy jump .
the moment passed .
it' s no big deal .
just friends , right ?
yeah , friends .
mercy jump .
stay away from my kid .
no , that' s too round .
shut up .
shut up !
shut up !
just make it ...
would you shut the hell up ? !
all right !
there' s people gettin ' their throats cut in this thing .
yep .
and your father said you could do this for the show ?
yep .
why the hell would he ok you singing this shit ?
because i saw him and maya naked in the shower .
oh , yeah .
heh heh !
that' il do it .
can i speak with an arthur brickman , please ?
ollie .
arthur .
hey , man .
how' re you doin ' ?
good .
how are you ?
good .
good to see you .
you know , the town voted unanimously , approved the water main , so ...
you were always great with a crowd .
well , except that ... that once , of course .
but that' s it .
it was the polar opposite of the fresh prince incident .
it was like i was on the top of my game .
which is why i wanted to see ya .
uh , i wanna ask you a favor .
anything , man .
what ?
ls there any way that you could get me an interview with your firm ?
you' re serious ?
i thought it was weird that you wanted to eat here .
oh , i know it' s gonna be tough ...
tough ?
ollie , you called a roomful of press a bunch of jerk offs , and trashed a client who' s one of the biggest movie stars on the planet .
he wasn' t big then .
no , but he is now .
you wanna know how big ?
when i left mandellkirschner , there were some firms that wouldn' t even look at my resume because i ...
no offense , but because i worked under you .
i' ve only been at angellotti a year now ...
you know what , man ?
forget i asked .
don' t worry about it .
seriously .
it was stupid .
i got carried away ...
no , let me finish .
what i was gonna say was ...
i' ve been waiting years to be in a position to be able to help you out , and now i am .
it' s not gonna be an easy sell , but ...
i think i can get you in a room with angellotti himself .
thank you so much .
of course .
you know , you' re a lot more affectionate than i remember .
ah , it' s just ...
i miss it so much , you know ?
it' s the only thing i was ever any good at .
oh , this is great .
i can move back here ...
i can put gertie in a really good , expensive private school ...
i can get her a nanny , you know ?
it' il be like that whole fresh prince thing never even happened .
i' il work on the old man when i get back to the office and call you tonight if it' s a go .
oh , great .
_ excuse me
_ psst _ dear , see to the customers
_ psst _ guess what' s the ...
_ quick now ! _ my heart' s a flutter
_ when i pound the floor _ it' s a signal to show that i' m ready to go _ when i pound the floor ...
i have to get the phone .
come on , pop !
do dad' s part .
me ?
yeah .
yeah , go do that .
hello ?
hey , arthur .
you' re kidding ?
_ i' il pound three times three times ...
why do i have to sing your dad' s part ?
i' m supposed to be the guy who gets clipped .
you are , but you' re dad' s understudy too .
what the hell is that ?
it means if daddy breaks a leg , then you do his part for him .
so , come on , try it again .
you' re doin ' good . _ i' il pound three times ... _ three times !
wait , wait , wait !
i' m supposed to be the understudy now .
i cannot work like this .
i' m sorry .
this is no way to run a show .
you were good .
you can go back to waiting in the wings , tommy tune .
i' il be doin ' my own singing henceforth .
who' s tommy tune ?
tommy tune is a man that you can get a chance to see live and on broadway when we move back to new york city !
what ?
what ?
what ?
what ?
yeah , what ?
i was just on the phone with an old friend that i worked with at mandellkirschner .
i had lunch with him and i asked him if he' d get me an interview with his new firm .
jesus , another interview , ollie ?
come on , when are you gonna learn ?
well , smart guy , he just called me , said he sat down with his boss , sold me to his boss like i was the cure for cancer .
it just so happens that a little spot has opened up in their music department .
boom !
after six years of being a pariah ,
i' m gonna get back in !
i' m talkin ' about no more street sweeper , no more picking up garbage , and no more water main !
i' m talking press lines , i' m talking about parties !
i' m talking about a westside address ,
i' m talkin ' about a good school for gertie !
but i already go to a good school .
yes , honey , but you' re gonna go to a way , way better school in new york city .
you' re gonna be able to take the subway to school .
won' t that be fun ?
but the subway' s full of junkies and mole men .
well , they are .
don' t listen to pop .
what do i tell you ?
he makes things up !
you' il see .
the subways are great .
i don' t wanna see .
i don' t wanna go to a school up in the city .
i wanna go to my school .
honey , it' s gonna be too far of a drive for me to come back down here to take you to school in new jersey every morning .
so let' s not move to the city .
let' s stay here with pop .
sweetheart , i' m too old to be living with my father .
i need to get my own place .
and pop ...
i mean , look at him , he' s a mad dog .
he doesn' t want us around here getting in his way , crampin ' his style ...
do you , pop ?
that' s all horseshit .
you know ... thanks , pop .
i don' t wanna move to the city .
i like it here .
pop says you can live here as long as you want .
baby , remember when i took you to see sweeney todd ?
how much fun was that ?
we had a good time , right ?
i mean , if we move to new york city , we can do that every night !
except for the nights you' re working , of course .
you know what ?
why don' t you shut up for a second , ok ?
i' m trying to talk to my daughter .
you love new york city .
you told me you loved the city .
no , i didn' t .
oh !
i said it was ok .
jesus christ !
i said i like highlands better .
why would you want some other job anyway , dad ?
you get to ride the batmobile !
baby , daddy doesn' t wanna drive the batmobile !
daddy wants to eat sushi !
daddy wants to hail cabs !
daddy wants to have a doorman !
daddy wants to lord it over magazine editors !
daddy loved his old job , and he' s missed it every day since he' s been gone .
daddy wants to do that job .
daddy doesn' t wanna pick up garbage forever !
but you told everybody at the meeting that your job' s good because you don' t have to wear a suit .
yes , but daddy was just saying that to get them to say yes to a water main .
so you were just lying to everybody ?
look , ok , i' il tell you what .
i' il go to the meeting , all right ?
lf i don' t like what the man says , then i won' t take the job .
now you' re lying to me !
all right , look , young lady !
i' m gonna go to this job interview on monday , whether you like it or not .
wait , this monday ?
yes .
ollie , you can' t go on monday .
why ?
because that' s the day of my show !
oh , shit .
it is , isn' t it ?
well , it' s at four , so i can , you know , make it back in time .
but my show' s at five !
on what planet are you gonna get back here by five if you' ve got a meeting in the city at four ?
just lay off me for a second !
i forgot about the show .
how could you forget ?
what , are you stupid ?
gertie , this job is very important to daddy .
what about my show ?
lsn' t that important to you ?
yes , honey , that' s even more important to me .
then don' t go to your stupid meeting about your stupid new job in the stupid city !
that' s enough , young lady !
i don' t even want you in the show !
you' re not even a good sweeney todd anyway .
pop' s way better .
even uncle greenie and uncle block are better than you .
those men are not your uncles !
oh , no , but we' re good enough to build sets for her show , right ?
sorry , i didn' t mean that .
where are you going ?
i don' t wanna be around you !
i don' t even want you to come to the show to watch it .
oh , come on !
i don' t !
i don' t even like you anymore !
get back here , young lady !
hey !
i' m talkin ' to you !
hey , young lady !
get back here , young lady !
no !
you can' t tell me what to do !
i don' t have to do anything you say !
yes , you do !
why ?
because i' m your father , that' s why !
so what ?
don' t you yell at me , gertrude !
i' il yell at you all i want !
blah , blah , blah !
i' m not moving to the stupid city !
all right , that' s it !
you are moving to the city and you' re gonna like it , and that' s the end .
i hate you !
i wish you' d died , not mommy !
i hate you right back , you little shit !
you and your mother took my life away and i just want it back !
god , i' m sorry .
i' m sorry , sweetheart .
i didn' t mean ...
get off me !
i' m sorry ...
get off of me !
what the hell' s the matter with you ?
huh ? !
_ i took my love and i took it down _ i climbed a mountain and i turned around _ and i saw my reflection in the snow covered hills _ till the landslide brought me down _ oh , mirror in the sky what is love ?
_ can the child within my heart rise above ? _ can i sail through the changing ocean tides ? _ can i handle the seasons of my life ?
_ mm mm ...
i don' t know
_ well , i' ve been afraid of changing _ ' cause i' ve built my life around you _ but time makes you bolder _ children get older _ and i' m getting older too
hey .
hey .
what happened to you the other night ?
you just sort of took off .
it looked to me like you guys needed a little privacy .
what i really needed was a little backup .
she' s a kid , ollie .
kids don' t weather change well .
i mean , in a few years , you won' t be able to keep her out of manhattan .
but for now , she just wants what she knows .
so do l .
yeah , but is that even what you know anymore ?
oh , jesus .
you too ?
you want your old life back .
big money job , out of your old man' s house ...
it' s not like it doesn' t make any sense .
yeah .
so ?
that' s your life that you want back , not theirs .
i mean , this is their life .
what you' re sort of saying to everybody who loves you is that what we have isn' t good enough for you .
so it' s just upsetting everybody , you know ?
everybody ?
oh ...
what , me ?
i mean , it' s not like we' ve got some big romance going on or anything .
we' re just friends , right ?
did you ever wonder if ... maybe someday it might ... be more than that ?
for about two seconds , before you had me hiding in the shower from your kid .
look , ollie , i like you , but ...
i' m not gonna be all heartbroken ' cause you' re leaving town .
i know .
even if i took this job in the city ,
i' d still come back down here and visit my old man .
and you .
why ?
i mean , you think i' m gonna stick around here for much longer ?
maya ...
ollie ...
i gotta get back to work .
lf ... if i don' t ... if i don' t see you at the show , give me a call sometime when you get all settled up in the big city .
come on ...
shit .
_ now there' s tears on the pillow _ darling where we slept _ and you took my heart when you left _ without your sweet kiss my soul is lost , my friend _ tell me , how do i begin again ?
_ my city' s in ruins _ my city' s in ruins
_ now with these hands _ with these hands _ with these hands _ with these hands _ i pray , lord _ with these hands
_ with these hands _ i pray for the strength , lord _ with these hands with these hands _ i pray for the faith , lord

i' m sorry .
i didn' t mean to wake you up .
it' s ok .
listen .
i' m sorry for yelling at you the other night .
i was wrong .
and i didn' t mean any of the things that i said .
i know .
neither did l .
daddy ?
yeah ?
did mommy like living in the city ?
yeah , she did .
she loved it .
then i guess i' il love it too .
thanks , sweetheart .
thanks .
you know , i still might make it to your show tomorrow , if the traffic' s not too bad .
i won' t be mad if you miss it .
i understand .

george clooney' s office for tony on line one .
the angellotti company .
one moment , please .
can i help you ?
yes .
my name' s oliver trinke and i' m here to see arthur brickman and mr. angellotti .
ok .
mr. trinke is here .
ok , i will .
they' il be about ten more minutes .
ok .
you can have a seat .
right , right ...
hello .
oh , my god ...
hi !
i' m here to see brad .
yes !
he' s expecting you , sir .
he apologizes , but he' s stuck in traffic he' s just a few blocks away .
why don' t you just have a seat and i' il let him know that you' ve arrived .
thank you very much .
they love to keep you waiting , don' t they ?
excuse me ?
they love to keep you waiting .
right .
yeah , yeah , they do .
i think they think it gives them a psychological edge , you know ?
well , it' s about to give ' em the edge of my ass ,
' cause that' s all they' re gonna see when i' m walkin ' out that door .
you know anything about these guys ?
only that they' re the fastest growing ...
... firm in the business .
yes , i read that article too .
all right , well ...
you know as much as i do .
i guess that means they know what they' re doing .
i suppose .
unless these publicists hire other publicists to get the word out for ' em .
right .
and then those publicists hire their own publicists to help spin the good publicity they created for these publicists .
of course , knowing publicists , they probably hire publicists to promote the fact that they spun the publicity that they hired the other publicists to spin .
so ...
oh man !
so what do you do ?
i' m a publicist .
i didn' t realize i was sitting here talking to an angellotti man .
well , to tell you the truth , i' m not an angellotti man .
at least not yet .
i' m here trying to get a job .
these guys have been tryin ' to steal me from my publicist since my last flick .
oh , the robot movie , right ?
oh , yeah , you saw it ?
i haven' t gotten around to it yet .
i' m gonna ...
oh , yeah .
thanks a lot for the support though , man .
i wanna see it ...
you know what ?
it' s not that good .
i have a kid .
i don' t get a chance to get out and see movies unless they have singing crabs in ' em .
singing crabs ?
i saw that one .
that means you have a girl .
that' s right .
how old is she ?
she' s seven .
yeah ?
cool .
i got a girl and two boys .
three kids ?
god .
how do you find time to make all those blockbusters ?
shoot , if i didn' t have all them damn kids ,
i wouldn' t have to make these blockbusters .
right .
oh , man .
it' s cool , though , isn' t it ?
making blockbusters ?
you tell me .
bein ' a parent , funny man .
it has its moments .
what' s your daughter' s name ?
gertrude .
damn !
why' d you do that to that girl , man ?
did you lose a bet ?
no .
no , it was my wife' s name .
" was " ?
ok , let me guess .
she took you for half after she saddled the kid with the name gert ?
i can' t blame it on her .
i saddled the kid with the name gert .
she died in childbirth .
so ...
no , no , no , it' s ...
i feel like an asshole , man .
don' t worry about it .
no , listen , i' m really sorry about that .
i didn' t see your movie , so we' re even .
trust me .
this is exactly why people don' t talk to each other in waiting rooms , right ?
probably .
although , i gotta tell ya ... the fact that the guy who wrote " parents just don' t understand " is now a parent completely makes up for it .
oh , man .
we don' t though , do we ?
what' s that ?
understand .
i mean , these kids today .
from the door , man , they got it all over us .
my daughter has it all over me , i can tell you that .
yeah , my middle one , my son ?
every time i walk out of the house in the morning he says , " daddy , how far you love me ?
i always pick somewhere close .
i love you to that table , man .
no , you don' t .
you love me all the way to the moon and back down to the dirt .
that' s great .
it take everything i got to walk out of that house .
you get to spend time with them on the set though , right ?
oh , yeah .
but if i was a smart man , i wouldn' t be sittin ' here right now .
i' d be at home playing in the dirt with my kids .
but we all know that i' m not famous ' cause of my brains .
it' s ' cause i' m , like , strikingly handsome , crazy sexy .
and i' m , like , hung like it' s ridiculous .
oh , man !
but i' m definitely not the sharpest spoon in the shed .
you know ...
it was really nice talking to you .
oh , hey , you too , man .
you out ?
i' m out .
hey , you recommend these guys ?
uh ... only guy i can recommend is named arthur brickman .
other than that , i can' t vouch for anybody .
whoa , whoa , hold on .

no .
i' m just a guy who' d rather play in the dirt with his kid .
