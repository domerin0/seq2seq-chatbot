casey ?
something wrong , mr. bast ?
no , not at all .
i was curious if you' d started weighing college options .
options ?
uh ...
heard of the helen stoller physics scholarship ?
no .
it' s given to a student from this state who shows most promise in science .
wouldn' t that be ann or ...
wyatt ?
no , it' s you .
you have a calling , casey .
i do ?
what is it ?
physics .
toast ?
uh ... sure .
you' re very lucky .
most people search their whole lives for their calling .
how do you know you have a calling ?
your brilliant teacher tells you .
and of course your 1 1 straight a pluses on exams is a hint .
you' il need a letter from me for the scholarship and think about a special physics project over the summer .
something unusual but personal .
let them know you a little .
he says it' s my calling .
qed .
how is this " quite easily demonstrated " ?
you' re as good in physics as i am .
not even close .
i grind , you glide .
event horizon .
one day that guy will wake up and realize he needs a math tutor .
and that tutor will be me .
figure out how to get us invited to even one party and you win the nobel .
hey , you' re casey , right ?
uh huh .
here' s an invite to my boyfriend' s party .
wow .
you' re in chem lab with julian wilson , right ?
mm hm .
can you give that to him ?
thanks .
that was way inconsiderate .
i love mr. bast .
lf he uncovered a scholarship i didn' t know about , he' s a genius .
and to think they pay him almost nothing .
the devaluation of teachers in our society , it just ...
it blows my mind .
mom .
i' m back .
sorry .
i have to figure out what he wants from me .
i mean , what is a personal science project ?
lsn' t the nature of science supposed to be completely unbiased and factual ?
now he wants the inner me , too ?
the whole secret of the study of nature lies in learning how to use one' s eyes .
you know who said that ?
i' m guessing it was a woman .
that was written by george sand , a woman forced to use a man' s name because she couldn' t get published .
mom .
okay .
anyway , i always tell my students ,
you' il know your topic when you learn how to use your eyes .
oh !
oh , no ...
she had it locked up .
i need to eat ice cream and all your mother has is leftover tofu .
can we go ?
sh !
sh !
look at that recovery !
amazing .
she' il still place .
she' s so precise .
i mean , down to the last ...
you know ...
i bet there is an exact aerodynamic formula .

# we are
# what everyone wants to be
# we are young and carefree
# life' s a breeze for people like you and me
# if you look
# life lays out just like a road
# it' s for us to grab a hold
# there' s no one can tell us no
# we' re alive

# doin ' fine #
what do you think you' re doing ?
l i' m ...
why are you filming skaters ?
for a physics project .
you' re scoping her triple loop .
why ?
no , i' m analyzing her movement .
who are you working for ?
nobody .
teddy , will you come over here ?
i' m gonna call the cops .
no , i didn' t think it would be a problem .
i thought this was a public rink ...
private practice only from six to ten .
these girls are training for the regional championships , which i think you perfectly well know .
no , i' m a student .
i have an ld .
i have a notebook .
whoa , yeah .
definitely spy code .
what are you doing here ?
you know her ?
she' s a science geek .
look , i' m sorry , but when the c. l . a. wants to learn new dirty tricks , they observe skaters and their moms .
tina , can i have a word ?
frank , not now .
i want to digitize some images into my computer to see if any kind of unified theory emerges .
okay , if gen knows you and you wanna press your nose up against the glass and take a few notes ,
i don' t really care .
but you' il have a hard sell with the parents .
absolutely not .
but no one outside of the scholarship committee will ever see this program .
here' s the letter from my teacher explaining the assignment .
and my driver' s license .
um ...
i' ve also got some letters of references from people i baby sat for .
let' s keep it moving , girls .
it' s possible .
we' il have the team nikki legal team check this out .
beautiful , sweetie .
thanks , mom !
no talking to my daughter .
she' s training .
no distraction .
not a word .
no .
look , i don' t care if you' re here .
lf you post me on the school website falling on my butt , you' d better transfer to another school .
okay , nikki .
let' s try that again .
keep it moving .
a little wider , that' s it .
hey !
no street shoes on the ice !
i' m sorry ...
sorry .
gen !
hello , hon .
gen !
gen !
brian , she' s training .
you know the rules .
i brought her a burger , mrs. h. gen can' t eat that .
come on , i' m burning tons of calories .
not enough .
a half hour ?
not if you wanna win .
you should coach our basketball team .
we could use a kick in the butt .
lf you don' t leave this instant , that' s exactly what you' il get .
bye .
i do not want him coming here during practice .
but i never get to see him .
every other girl i know ...
you' re not like the other girls .
winners make sacrifices .
maybe they just cheat .
turn that off !
sorry .
take it from the layback .
the conclusion' s too simplistic .
the kinetic energy in a jump equals half the skater' s mass times velocity squared , minus ...
no , i could barely understand it .
but ... ?
i don' t know if they' il care but it' s just a little bit ... ... dry .
mr. bast said i have to make it personal .
how do i do that ?
i don' t know .
put more you in it .
oh , excuse me , tina .
ls there any way that i could take a few lessons ?
i think i might be able to write better about the physics principles if i' m the one actually applying them .
lf there' s any way i could ...
fine .
we' re starting a novice class for the summer .
three afternoons a week . $800 . $800 ?
popcorn !
i want popcorn !
where are my gummi bears ?
i gave them to you .
four hot dogs !
oh , i' m sorry ...
you touched that with your fingers .
oh , fine .
you don' t want it ?
i' il eat it .
oh , you breathed on it !
you shouldn' t work here .
you' re here again ?
um ...
i' m working .
it' s for my science project .
aren' t you going overboard with this project ?
no , i' m totally committed to it , like you' re committed to skating .
whatever .
i' m starving .
b. l. t. here .
hold the b , heavy on the l.
um ... sure .
beef patty .
squish it till it' s dry .
no bun .
salad for me .
coming up .
just iceberg lettuce , half a cup of garbanzos and a lemon wedge .
oh , and a quarter cup of cheese .
ooh , cheese !
it' s saturday .
i can pig out if i want to .
i don' t know what' s wrong .
i' m popping my lutz .
it' s all that cheese .
would you shut up ?
i' ve gotta focus .
i heard zoey bloch' s been sticking a quad .
that is a rumor .
which she probably started herself .
early in the season for stupid head games .
not for zoey .
food' s ready !
that is way more than a quarter cup .
um ...
it' s $1 . 65 , $2 . 35 and $3 . 35 .
that' s $ 7 . 30 .
or if you split it the other way , it' s $1 . 75 and $5 . 55 .
whoa .
you can keep it all if you just stop doing that .
you' re welcome .
all right , everybody .
welcome to our snowplow sam class .
let' s line up .
lookin ' good .
class , can you tell our assistant the most important rule for this class ?
mom ...
never be late .
right .
we have a lot to do if we are going to be ready for our recital in august .
we are going to work on our toe loop .
our lutz .
but first , all of you have to get comfortable with throwing your bodies into the air .
casey , you' re the physics whiz .
what' s that rule about what goes up ?
technically , it' s that every particle attracts ...
casey .
must come down .
this ... is your new best friend .
oh !
oh ...
look , could you try not to , like , squish me ?
i' m sorry .
casey .
pull your arms in tighter .
they' re throwing you off balance .
arms in .
okay .
now try that about 5, 000 more times .
right .
push over on your right leg .
don' t look at your feet .
look straight ahead .
jeremy !
that toe pick is there for a reason !
you dig it in .
or no friends over for a week .
this is a lot of pressure for a recital .
it' s not only a recital .
it' s a u. s. f. s. a. j. s. t.
earth speak , please ?
it' s the first step in qualifying for the regionals .
i mean for us kids .
oh .
you don' t have to do it .
that' s good .
because it' s not humanly possible .
you set me free ]
# can' t you see
# there' s a feeling that' s come over me
# close my eyes
# you' re the only one that leaves me
# completely breathless
# no need to wonder why
# sometimes a gift like this you can' t deny
# oh , ' cause i wanted to fly
# so you gave me your wings
# and time held its breath
# so i could see , yeah
# and you set me free #
are you out of your mind ? !
hey , don' t you know anything ?
no skating when the zamboni' s out .
i' m fine .
i' m fine .
thank you .
oh , you' re fine ?
okay .
i' m sorry .
look , you wanna tell me what was in your head ?
i' ve never skated on such a smooth surface before .
i wanted to see what it was like .
lake skater ?
pond .
near my house .
look , you need a hand .
no !
i' m good to go .
oh !
you must really want that a.
wow , that' s a lot of styrofoam .
it' s not for an a.
it' s for a physics scholarship .
what , like , uh ... inertia and drag and velocity and all that ?
how do you know about that ?
i' m into cars .
get this baby out on the road , i can open her up to ... ... seven miles an hour .
blow the doors off any street sweeper in town .
um ...
i should get home .
yeah , you should .
can' t do the ice until you' re off .
right .
sure .
well ...
how' s it coming ?
it' s coming .
it takes incredible training and effort and there' s artistry involved but i' m sorry ,
i just can' t get past the twinky little outfits .
mom , they' re actually very aerodynamically sound .
it sets us back 50 years .
lf i ever saw you squeezed into one of those things , i' d probably start crying .
believe me , you never will .
will you get some sleep ?
please ?
hello .
this is my video presentation .
hi .
i' m casey carlyle .
cut a second .
i sound like a driver' s ed movie .
relax .
do it like you' re talking to me .
hey , there .
i' m casey .
oh , my god .
i forgot my last name .
can i start over ?
hi .
i' m casey carlyle .
i decided to see if i could make myself prove my own hypothesis on the application of physics to the required elements of competitive figure skating .
now , i' m going to increase the centripetal force by tucking in my arms .
this will increase my moment of inertia , so i will spin ... ... faster .
i' il increase the height of my jump by applying more force to my toe pick .
you know , you look kinda hot .
shut up .
i' m gonna start off with a bad one .
for the before shot .
yeah , that pretty much blew .
okay .
now you' re making me mad .
good .
when you sign with nike , remember i wear size six and a half .
i want to do the recital .
for science .
be here tonight , 5 : 30 .
okay .
mm !
tina ...
i have this harvard alumni tea thing at three .
then , what are we talking about ?
no , it' s okay .
i' il make it .
um ...
you have nothing to wear .
come by my house at noon .
maybe one of my old things will work for you .
wow .
okay .
what ?
thanks !
sweetie ?
just a second !
hold on !
almost ready ?
uh huh .
i have a surprise for you .
that does it .
perfect .
i think the whole effect is very grown up , with a nod to femininity .
we' ve evolved past flaunting it , but we don' t have to deny it .
i mean , you are going to be mingling with your future prospective classmates and professors , and i really wanted the look to say , " we are serious .
well , it definitely succeeds .
mom , we don' t have to stay at this thing for more than an hour , right ?
um , because ... there' s something i have to tell you .
oh ...
oh , honey .
what was that ?
i' ve been so worried .
you' ve been living at that rink , but you' re here , now .
and you' re excited , because you understand what' s really important .
look , i' ve got goose bumps .
i' m sorry , that was so type a of me .
mom disease .
just relax .
just be yourself .
your normal , poised , charming , articulate ...
mom ...
do you wanna go over it one more time ?
hi .
i' m casey carlyle , and i' m attracted to the physics program because ...
physics rocks .
ln sophomore year , you can join the quantum club and that rocks because we compete against cal tech , mlt and stanford .
last year , our ion particle accelerator took first place .
it rocked .
sounds really , um ... rockin ' .
it is , it really is .
do you know what i think is great ?
lf casey' s scholarship works out ,
i' m sensing that you two will be spending scads of time together .
hors d' oeuvre ?
oh , how wonderful , bruschetta .
lf you have some time right now ,
i' il take you through the entire physical sciences syilabus .
we have got nothing but time !
don' t we , case ?
great !
i know i' m late .
i' m sorry .
that' s the first rule .
all right , let' s get ready .
come on .
that' s what she said ...
i have to do two turns ...
really ?
yeah .
we' re supposed to go round the side , remember ?
oh ...
it' s right there .
right there , is that better ?
yeah ...
deep breath .
and then you let it out .
it didn' t work .
come on .
okay , everybody .
i' il take that .
good luck .
thanks .
nice and slow .
lily , no talking .
hi .
it' s oh so quiet ]

bravo !
yes !
whoo !
what' s my score ?
how did i do ?
how did i do ?
novice pass . " yes !
casey , how did you do ?
fine , i guess .
it says ... " junior pass .
what ?
you skipped two levels .
why didn' t i skip two levels ?
because you' re six , lily .
junior level is where gen and nikki and tiff are at .
ls that true , tina ?
that i' m on a junior level ?
yes , it' s true .
okay , everybody , let' s get changed .
come on , everybody .
let' s go .
so , if i ...
lf i wanted to compete ?
you can' t .
why not ?
what happened was , the judges saw the same thing i' ve been seeing all summer .
you got some raw talent .
that' s not enough for a shot at the regionals .
you need a coach , a valet , a choreographer , private ice time .
nikki' s parents took out a second mortgage to do this .
and tiffany' s dad works two jobs .
oh .
where d' you get those skates ?
garage sale .
they' re falling off your feet .
you need custom boots , $600 minimum , and the blades need to be sharpened every six weeks .
you get it ?
i' m sorry .
it is what it is .
you have to want it .
you have to want it more than anything else .
it' s not something you do on a whim .
you know what i was thinking , miss senior ?
this is the last first day of school .
because the next first day , you' il be in a dorm .
so i went a little nuts .
i made pancakes with white flour .
can you believe summer' s over ?
we' re wasting our lives here .
heard you landed a double .
tiff !
well ?
that took me two years .
really ?
so i guess we' il see you then ?
no , you won' t .
not at the rink .
i can' t train with you guys .
why not ?
um , i can' t afford it .
oh !
yeah .
but , um , it' s been fun .
look , casey .
i' il tell you something , all right .
you don' t know how lucky you are .
for what ?
to have a life .
you think i have a life ?
i know you do .
you have tv time , and friend time ...
but you get to skate all you want .
more than i want .
i' d love to be you .
have a saturday night , see your boyfriend ...
yeah ...
eat what you want .
like bread .
buckets and buckets of bread .
oh , boo hoo hoo !
who cares ?
who cares about all that stuff ?
don' t you just wanna skate all the time ?
no .
no .
what' s the matter with you people ?
are you insane ?
the jumping shrimp is a skating machine .
" the jumping shrimp " ?
my mom copyrighted it .
see ya .
scary .
we must learn from her .
this is exactly what the scholarship committee is looking for .
your enthusiasm for the project just leaps off the page .
ln fact , it' s so good , you could probably sell it .
thanks .
tiffany .
hey .
what if i told you i could fix your spread eagle ?
would you like to learn how to stop traveling on your sit spin ?
i don' t !
well , maybe i do .
you could land your double axel .
clean .
fly ]
# i needed some wings to make it right
# i had to fly away
# i busted out and headed straight
# now i' m lovin ' life
# ' cause nothin ' can get in my way
# i' m the prettiest thing in the sky
# break me , break me
# you think you can take me , take me ...
and she' s back !
how' d you score the rink time ?
physics !
i' m trading my science project .
look , you carved up my nice smooth ice .
but , you know , it wasn' t so hard watching you do it .
casey !
mom ?
what are you doing here ?
orthodontist .
new nightguard fitting .
remember ?
here .
what' s ...
what' s going on here ?
who' s this ?
uh ...
teddy .
right .
teddy .
teddy drives the zamboni .
teddy the zamboni driver .
i thought you were working on your project .
she was .
your daughter' s very talented .
and ... and you are ... ?
tina .
tina harwood ?
yes .
the skater .
yes .
with all the trophies and the little outfits .
yes .
well , don' t let me interrupt .
carry on with all your fun here .
thank you .
i will .
come on , mom .
yes .
yes , of course .
bye .
okay .
you need to keep your knees in tighter , point your foot , so you' il spin faster .
okay , easy enough .
get up ]
# i' m not afraid to fall
# it means i climbed up high
# to fall is not to fail
# you fail when you don' t try
# not afraid to fall i might just ...
better ?
perfect .
# if i get up i might fall back down again
# so let' s get up , come on
# if i get up i might fall back down again
# we get up anyway
# if i get up i might fall back down again
# so let' s get up , come on
# if i get up i might fall back down again
# and i might fall back down again #
it worked !
just like you said it would .
the computer doesn' t make the jumps .
that was all you .
come on , mom , just this one time .
i' il be back by eleven .
come on , mom , just this one time .
i' il be back by eleven .
you have a 5 : 30a . m . practice tomorrow .
think you' re gonna be all sparkly for that if i let you stay out all hours ?
mom , i landed my axel .
can' t i just have one saturday night , please ?
who are you going with ?
hi , um ...
d' you wanna hang out tonight ?
with you ?
yeah , you know , get something to eat .
maybe do a movie or something .
um ... yeah .
but ...
here we are ...
this doesn' t look like a movie .
gen !
gen !
gen !
gen !
i , um ...
i' m not dressed for a party .
shake it .
your hair .
now , no one will notice .
work the hair .
hi .
hi .
i don' t know any of these people .
sure , you do .
they' re all in your class .
there' s ...
jason , football .
and luke , soccer .
i know them but i ...
i don' t actually talk to them .
i don' t talk to guys or ... people .
well , now would be the perfect time to start .
hey , kyle .
hey .
casey .
casey , kyle .
kyle plays hockey .
casey skates .
hey .
you guys have a lot in common .
have fun .
but ...
i ...
brian !
so you skate , huh ?
figure , uh ... skate .
figure skate .
oh .
i wouldn' t let the rest of the team hear this but you guys could probably skate circles around us .
but not pushing a puck .
why don' t you come to our next game ?
whoo hoo !
go !
go !
go !
uh oh .
what ?
well , assuming his weight to be about 1 50lbs , at that rate of descent , his estimated trajectory would bring him ... ... directly through the window .
oooh !
i mean , it' s a simple v times m equals a miscalculation .
you know , velocity times momentum equals acceleration .
physics .
yeah , i have to , um ...
yeah , later .
do you know who that was ?
that was kyle dayton .
way hot .
word of advice .
don' t ever speak again .
when i get nervous , i kind of babble a little .
it' s like this gear gets loose in my head .
like those planck diagrams , where ...
you' re doing that babbling thing again .
i think babbling is cool .
come on , casey .
thanks .
get your shine on ]
# get your , get your shine on get your , get your shine on
# too hot too hot ... #
so you' re gen' s cover tonight , huh ?
it' s usually my job .
she could' ve warned me we were going to a party .
you know , my sister has her own problems .
your sister ?
yeah .
you' re tina' s son ?
ls that so hard to believe ?
no , no , wow , i just , um ...
i just thought ...
i was the help ?
i mean , i kinda am .
gen skates and i fix stuff .
well , most stuff .
an object is only as strong as its weakest point .
physics .
thanks .
right , so ...
tell me about , um ... ... fixing stuff .
well , i mean the rink was a pit when my mom bought it .
mostly with her divorce money .
i helped bring it back .
i did the repair work , the painting ...
the zamboni .
that was my favorite part .
so , um , for you it' s the science stuff ?
um ... right .
sorry .
yeah , nice one !
klutz !
dork .
just can' t keep off the ice , can you ?

hi .
where have you been ?
stayed late at school .
no , where have you been all week ?
this tutoring thing has got me totally stretched out .
why are you doing this ?
this kid is the dumbest ninth grader on the planet .
mom , it looks good on my application .
ann' s doing it too .
ann was with you just now ?
yeah .
five minutes ago .
ann just phoned for you .
what' s going on ?
nothing .
and since when do you get a c on a test ?
i saw it in your room .
i was not snooping .
i mean , you and as are like peanut butter and jelly .
ls it belated rebellion ?
what ?
ls it ... ... a boy ?
mom , no !
i' m sorry .
you do realize what is at stake with your grades right now ?
i know .
i know .
i' m sorry .
i feel bad about the c , okay ?
can you just give it a rest ?
sweetie !
mom , i just want to compete at regionals .
why ?
what do you have to gain by this ?
i' m good .
so , what are you saying ?
you wanna just blow off our whole plan for you , chuck the scholarship and become a professional athlete ?
case , what is the shelf life on an ice skater ?
eight years ?
and then a few years touring with has beens on lce .
and that' s it ?
that' s the end of your life ?
i love it , mom .
case , there' s no shelf life on your mind .
lf i' d learned to use mine a little sooner , if i' d gone to college when i was your age , maybe we wouldn' t be living like this .
there' s nothing wrong with the way we live .
i' ve not been able to give you a quarter of the things i' ve wanted to .
you' ve given me everything .
then you need to give me something now .
attention , skaters !
we will be playing classical music the entire ride .
oh , mom !
unless , of course , someone wins a trophy .
and then its outkast for you .
yeah !
and earplugs for me .
so , we' re picking up a stray .
hey .
lsn' t your mom coming ?
she' s not really into skating .
guess what ?
slonski toyota sponsorship , it' s a done deal .
we' re way behind on marketing .
i' m working two jobs for you because you' re worth it .
and you' il be even more worth it when you win .
trs harsh .
you think ?
hey , watch this .
hey , nik .
everyone says you and i are gonna take first and second today .
nice try .
what was that about ?
classic psych out .
softens up the competition so they don' t go all out to win .
don' t ever fall for it .
got it .
no matter what happens in the short program , even if you tank , just tell yourself it' s only one third of the score .
never freak till after the long .
freak after the long .
okay .
hey , slowpoke !
you' re coming too ?
well , i don' t have to if you don' t want me to .
well , i guess if the van breaks down or something .
rock and roll ]
rock and roll ]
hey , that' s zoey bloch , a. k. a. skate thief .
well , well .
lf it isn' t the leaping dwarf .
it' s the jumping shrimp , actually .
like that' s a step up ?
don' t talk to her , nikki .
and don' t get any closer .
you don' t wanna lose your skates .
like i' d need to steal her skates to win this ?
or a lame computer program ?
how' d she know about that ?
she' s got eyes in the back of her horns .
beat it , harwood .
make me , bloch .
don' t engage , gennifer .
you should know better than that .
zoey , come on .
lmagine you are in ...
a bubble .
i know , mom .
remember , don' t ...
deviate from my program .
even if you do nothing but fall , it' s not ...
even an option .
i know , mom .
look at me .
so you' re the one trying to make it without a coach .
i just wanted to wish you luck .
it' s not easy going out there your first time .
thanks .
you just gotta keep focused .
and be impressive .
set the groundwork for next year .
next year ?
no way are you gonna place this year .
the judges have already ranked this thing in their minds .
nice skates .
hey , come on .
it' s just another classic psych out .
it' s the old , " you' ve already lost so why bother trying ?
come on .
don' t get offended .
just one little question .
what ?
haven' t you heard of eyeliner ?
not yet .
casey !
stop .
not yet .
i really appreciate the effort , but i don' t think there' s a lot to work with .
i' m ...
you' re hot .
but stay away from brian .
he' s mine .
teddy ...
teddy you can have .
oh , um , but i don' t ...
you know , i may not be as smart as you are , but i' m not an idiot .
ladies and gentlemen , welcome to the 54th annual
new england regional figure skating competition .
our first skater for the short program is zoey bloch from worcester , massachusetts .
can can ]
we love skating and we love gold !
yes !
okay , we' re in .
definitely top four .
you' re going to the sectionals !
unless sasha cohen makes a guest appearance .
good job .
good luck .
our final skater is casey carlyle from millbrook , connecticut .
some numbers ...

mom , she' s got the crowd .
# quicker than a ray of light
# quicker than a ray of light [ crowd roars ]
did you know she had a triple ?
she came to win .
she figured that out on her computer .
mom , the computer doesn' t make the jumps for you .
# and i feel like i just got home
# and i feel

number one !
yes !
yeah !
you crushed , baby !
it' s only the short , shorty .
fourth .
we' il take it .
fifth , that' s great !
yeah , but fifth doesn' t go to sectionals .
skate a clean program tonight , you can move up .
knock me out of fourth .
casey , you almost lost a boot out there .
i know , it' s giving out .
i think you' d better come with me .
how do they feel ?
i really can' t accept these .
just show me you deserve them .
and we' il need a pair of blades .
i' il have them sharpened for you right away .
tina , i can' t believe that you would help ...
no fawning .
no .
just ...
thank you .
and the next performer in the junior ladies free skate is casey carlyle from millbrook , connecticut .
oh !
who is it ?
and that' s how it' s done , dwarf .
shut up , pincushion .
come on , sweetie .
excuse me .
i' m going to sectionals !
good girl !
congratulations !
are those new ?
yeah .
are you crazy ?
you can' t compete on new skates .
they take , like , a minimum of ten days to break in .
everybody knows that .
but tina didn' t tell me .
you mean tina , whose robot daughter almost didn' t make sectionals because of you ?
typical tina harwood .
just like sarajevo .
you don' t know anything , do you ?
they kicked her out .
you might wanna reconsider that no coach thing .
bye , new girl .
meet at the van in 40 minutes .
okay , sure thing .
there she is .
congratulations .
thanks .
you were awesome .
i am so happy that it' s over .
are you happy about my feet ?
what ?
i' m sorry , casey , but your old skates were a mess .
you bought her new skates ?
please , like you didn' t know .
casey , i didn' t !
how can you lie to my face ?
you' re just as bad as she is .
hey , ease up , casey .
oh , just defend her !
like you weren' t part of it .
how could you think that ?
because it' s true .
you set me up .
all of you .
what kind of people are you ?
come on , let' s go .
mom ?
can you come and get me ?
i' m at the skating rink at westerly .
i want to come home .
honey , get in the car .
just get in the car , honey .
how dare you ?
just hang on , kids .
you think you can just waltz away after injuring my daughter ?
it' s joan , right ?
pulling her away from her studies behind my back ?
filling her head with a fantasy that she can skate and sabotaging her chances ?
i did you a favor .
you didn' t want this for casey and you' re right .
she' s not cut out for it .
ls she gifted ?
i' il give her that .
but casey won' t fight for it .
she' s too polite to do what you have to .
to push past everyone and everything and just take it .
so that' s the example you set for your daughter .
to lie and to sneak around and to cheat .
i made my daughter strong , and you made casey at home in a lecture hall .
and she' il do very well there .
so you see , we agree .
my daughter' s brilliant and will succeed at whatever she does .
but she will do it the right way despite people like you trying to convince her otherwise .
casey !
i' m in shape .
i can keep up with you .
go away .
casey , i didn' t know !
right !
where have you been ?
you are aware you had practice half an hour ago ?
yes , i' m aware .
and ?
and i' m done .
done ?
i' m quitting .
you' ve got to be kidding .
that' s ridiculous .
no , i was ridiculous for putting myself through this for so long .
we both know i don' t have the talent .
perseverance is nine tenths of mastering any sport .
do you know what i want ?
no , you don' t know what i want .
because you never cared .
lf you have any sense of self preservation , you' il scatter .
i' m listening .
i wanna stop missing school .
i like school .
you know , it' s stupid and the band will probably be horrible , but i wanna go to the homecoming dance .
and i wanna go with brian .
i want to stop feeling an idiot for flunking math because i don' t have time to learn it .
and i want ...
all right .
all right .
i can see maybe we' ve overdone it .
overdone it ?
just a little .
casey' s skates , mom .
we' il continue this discussion at home .
you heard the whole thing ?
yeah .
are you okay ?
it' s your slot , casey .
lf i drop out , you' re next .
you' il go to sectionals .
no .
thanks .
tomorrow' s my harvard interview .
that' s my slot .
that' s what i should be doing .
you sure about that ?
it' s a nice little experiment .
how does a triple loop jump entitle you to a physics scholarship ?
the proof of the experiment isn' t in the mumbo jumbo of the calculations .
it' s in the improvement in the skating of three junior champions .
i also applied the findings to my own skating and ...
... and actually managed to implement the experiment in a very rewarding and entirely personal way .
well , good , because passion is a key component of what we look for in students .
passion makes people go on to do exceptional things .
so , casey , why are you passionate about harvard ?
dr. healey , my mom and i have been imagining harvard practically my whole life .
i can' t believe i' m saying this , but what i need to be doing ,
i can' t do here .
i' m sorry i' ve wasted your time .
i' m so sorry .
miss carlyle , we won' t reschedule .
i know .
you can' t do this , case .
you' re giving up your dream .
no , mom , i' m giving up your dream .
i' m going after mine .
how did you know ?
didn' t think you' d give up .
which meant you' d be out here bumping it out .
teddy , i' ve been trying to find some way to apologize .
i' ve got some ideas about that .
medium smooth or glassy ?
i can' t have a conversation with anybody i haven' t known since kindergarten , so how come i can do that in front of you ?
because you let people see you when you skate .
but , casey , you can' t win going it alone .
you' re gonna need some help .
what do you want ?
five minutes .
you owe me that much .
lf you' re here for an apology , you won' t get one .
i' m not here for an apology .
tell me what happened in sarajevo .
why didn' t you win ?
i had an unfortunate warm up before my short program .
i collided with another skater and she got hurt .
are you sorry ?
look , i paid my dues .
i was suspended .
by the time they considered reinstating me , i was 26 and it was too late .
but there isn' t a day goes by that i don' t wish i could relive that moment and do it differently .
i want you to coach me for sectionals .
why on earth would i do that ?
because you don' t have a skater and i don' t have a coach .
we' re a perfect match .
i don' t think you have what it takes .
tina , i have to do this .
i want this more than i' ve ever wanted anything .
i said no to harvard .
i will work harder than any skater you have ever trained .
and if i fail , i fail , but because i wasn' t good enough , not because i didn' t have the guts .
i want to know what i can do in this sport , and i' m going to find out .
the rink .
tomorrow , 5 : 30a . m . , and get a good night' s sleep .
you' re gonna need it .
that you' d even consider letting that woman back into your head !
i don' t have to like her or trust her .
no , you just wanna spend all your time with her .
i' m not gonna turn into her .
she' s already rubbed off on you .
that' s not true .
where did this hair come from ?
and the make up and shirt ?
i did not buy you that shirt .
that has nothing to do with it .
i think you wanna be exactly like her , and if you happen to lie now and again , well , hey , at least you' il be glamorous .
you think this is about glamour ?
it is a sport , mom .
it is a thrilling and beautiful sport .
are you sure it doesn' t just make you feel beautiful ?
so what if it does ?
what is so horrible about that ?
about feeling strong and graceful and beautiful for once in my life ?
why are you jealous of her ?
well , i guess no matter how old we get , the rest of us will still always hate the prom queen .
you know it' il always be the casey and mom show .
do l ?
but if you could just come to the rink and see me .
don' t ask me !
i can' t !
come with me right now .
mom .
just come watch me skate , and then tell me that i should stop .
you know what , i have a class , all right ?
welcome to espn at the eastern sectional junior ladies ' short program .
i have to say , from the practice sessions i' ve seen , these ladies are fired up .
that' s right .
every skater has worked unbelievably hard to get here .
and every one of them is ready to compete .
so , are you a science geek too ?
math geek .
really ? lf i could pass math , maybe i could get into college .
do you tutor ?
do you know any cute guys ?
first up in the ladies ' short program is zoey bloch .
she skates all out all the time and this crowd is just rocking out .
tiffany is probably the most graceful skater in this competition , and she' s definitely on today .
i thought chantal was showing signs of nerves earlier .
not any more .
she' s in total command out there .
fans call her the jumping shrimp but remember that name because this little dynamo has been landing massive jumps .
can can ]
the word " newcomer " doesn' t even begin to cover casey carlyle .
she' s never performed in a skating competition until this season .
definitely one to keep your eye on .
the standings are
zoey bloch in first place , nikki fletcher in second , followed by chantal degroat and casey carlyle .
4 . 8s to 4 . 9s !
one 5 . 0 !
and one 4 . 6 .
oh , come on !
no " good job " or " way to go " ?
at least i landed the jumps .
you' re in the game , no more .
i' m not seeing much fluidity coming out of your jumps and that hurt you artistically .
remember ...
your next movement is always part of the previous one .
rub your feet for at least five minutes and drink lots of water .
you pulled it out , girl !
only the short .
it' s only the short .
i lied .
you mess up the short , you can never win .
hey , did you work things out with your mum ?
um , we' ve hardly spoken in two months .
i think i broke her heart .
we can trace that plot line from euripides through shakespeare crossing the pond to mark twain , finding contemporary echoes in john cheever or ... ... janet jackson .
don' t you mean shirley jackson ?
you' ve done your reading .
all right .
next week , i want an essay on your candidate for the " less is more feminist writer of the 20th century .
from new york city , new york , emma flanders .
from new york city , new york , emma flanders .
this is it .
you can lose the long program just sitting here if you don' t prepare properly .
put these in .
why ?
believe me , you don' t wanna know .
lf they fall , you' il get cocky , if they bring the crowd to its feet , you' il feel pressure .
no one else exists .
go into the bubble .
toxic ]
forget it .
i just need to hear her voice .
you' ve reached the carlyles .
we' re not here right now ...
it' s not about her .
this is about you .
our final skater is casey carlyle from millbrook , connecticut .
one more thing .
what ?
skate with your heart .
# all my life
# there was just me and my dreams
# and the days went ticking by like the beat of my heart
# spent my nights wondering how it would feel
# when the waiting would end and tomorrow would start
# suddenly i see a light
# out of the darkness i' m coming alive
# so this is how it feels reaching for heaven
and here' s her opening jump , a triple salchow .
# like a phoenix rising from the flames
# i' m reaching for heaven
it' s good for the nerves .
thanks . # all this time
# i never knew i was so strong
# a flame burning bright
# that was there all along
# in your eyes i can see all i can be
# suddenly i want it all
# i know you' il catch me if ever i fall
# so this is how it feels reaching for heaven
# and this is how it feels kissing the sky
triple loop .
perfect landing .
what ?
she just threw in that triple lutz !
threw in' s right , complete improvisation .
she deviated .
and i' il bust her for it .
tomorrow .
who said you could let go ?
# it' s my turn to show you
# this is how it feels
i haven' t seen anyone come back this far from a disaster since midori lto in the ' 92 olympics .
that has to be the rally of the year .
# i' m reaching for heaven
# heaven # [ wild cheering ]
casey carlyle waits for marks .
nikki and zoey first and second in the ordinals , degroat third .
will that fall cost her , or will that rally , not to mention the added technical difficulty push her past the others ?
high !
5 . 1 s and 5 . 2s .
they' re almost dead even with nikki fletcher' s .
that' s my daughter .
that' s my daughter .
here' s her artistic set of marks .
hold on .
hold on .
those are almost even with nikki' s .
did she do it ?
no , it' s not enough .
she' il have to settle for silver .
this takes her to nationals and who knows , maybe the 2006 olympics .
with this skater , anything is possible .
thank you .
case ?
mom ?
lf i' d known .
lf i' d just taken ten minutes and gone to the rink with you ,
i never would have ...
mom .
i' m sorry .
i' m so sorry .
how could i not see ?
you see me better than anybody .
come on .
casey .
congratulations .
and you can drive the zamboni any time you want .
i was this close , this close to losing !
where did those triples come from ? !
sweetheart , you ...
don' t you know what' il happen after six months with tina ?
what ?
she' s gonna whip my butt !
someone is gonna pay big time .
nikki .
can we have a word ?
hello , peter .
just wanted to say congrats .
we look forward to seeing the jumping shrimp at the nationals .
that is so sweet .
i just went out there and skated my best .
and today , i guess my best was good enough .
love you .
you know i can' t afford this .
we' il need to find a sponsor .
i' m on it .
burger blast is interested .
burger blast ?
oh no , i am sorry .
i' m sorry , no .
why not ?
lf she can' t eat it , she can' t endorse it .
we' il need something healthier .
how about grape nuts ?
grape nuts ?
what about cod liver oil ?
guys .
you know , i am her mother .
what i say goes .
she is my daughter .
she is my skater .
well , daughter trumps skater .
well , ask any professional athlete , coach trumps mother every time .
guys !
and that boy , we' il need to nip that in the bud .
i can' t go through all this and a boy too .
that is a huge distraction .
it' s unacceptable .
i don' t believe this !
you will be busy training .
and four college courses .
four ?
are you out of your mind , with everything she' s doing ?
all right , two .
but then four in the fall .
only if she wins sectionals .
oh , she will .
