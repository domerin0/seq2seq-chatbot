wejust so almost[ br ] got our asses kicked[ br ] back there !
i mean , i knew i' d seen[ br ] those routines before .
we usedtoplay[ br ]
east compton[ br ] all the time .
you really had no idea , [ br ] did you ?

my entire[ br ] cheerleading career[ br ] has been a lie .
well , look on the bright side .
it' s only cheerleading .
i am only cheerleading .
do you believe in curses ?
what are you talking about ?
i think i' m cursed .
and why is that ?
this past summer[ br ] at cheer camp , all the new seniors[ br ] had to do a dare .
see , there' s this thing[ br ] calledthespirit stick , andit can never , [ br ] evertouch theground .
torrance shipman , [ br ] your mission , should you[ br ] choose to accept it ... and you better ... is to capture[ br ] the spirit stick ... anddrop it in front[ br ] ofthe entire camp .
doyou wannago my way
doyou wannago my way
the future is clear[ br ]
let' sget intogear
y' all are such[ br ] an inspiration to us .

with the spirit stick .
here .
doyou wannago my way
doyou wannago my way[ br ]
here .
i don' t want it now .
no , it' s okay .
the spirit stick[ br ] doesn' t lose anything .
the person who drops it , [ br ] however ,
i don' t mean to laugh , [ br ] but cheerleading[ br ] urban legends ?
you' re notjinxed .
shit happens .
i have to tell you[ br ] something .
i' m on the phone , creep .
i realize that , [ br ] and normally i' d be[ br ] listening on the other line , but this is important .
okay , what ?
ohh !

thankyou for listening .
yo .

is aaron around ?
do you know when ?
no .
have him call torrance .
it' s urgent .
all right .
big red totally screwed us !
i mean monster screwed us !
i put this to the entire squad .
swearyou guys didn' t know .
big red didn' t exactly[ br ] let any of us help with[ br ] the routines , torrance .
i cannot believe she did this .
i feel awful .
it' s depraved .
i mean , those east compton girls[ br ] wanted to grill our asses .
big redran theshow , man .
we werejust flying ignorami , [ br ] forsobbing out loud .
we can' t go to regionals[ br ] with a stolen routine .
it' s too risky .
changing the routine now ... would be total[ br ] murder suicide .
seriously .
let' s not put[ br ] the " duh " in " dumb .
how are east compton[ br ] gonna prove anything ?
you people are unbelievable .
i mean , we' re talking about[ br ] cheating here .
sorry , new girl , [ br ] but nobody hit your buzzer .
look , lhate to bepredictable , [ br ] but idon' t give a shit .
we learned that routine[ br ] fair and square .
we logged the man hours .
don' t punish the squad[ br ] for big red' s mistake .
this isn' t about cheating .
this is about winning .
everyone in favor ofwinning ?
iget whatyou' re saying , [ br ]
missy , but there' s no time .
lfwe don' t do the routine , [ br ] we' ve got nothing else .
so , you in ?

i keep trying to call you .
yeah , i know .
i' ve been , like , [ br ] totally busy with school[ br ] and practice and stuff .
what' s up ?
oh , it' s bad , aaron .
miss red snaked[ br ] our routines from[ br ] the east compton clovers .
all ofour routines .
what ?
they found out .
they showed up at the game .
gauntlets were thrown .
tell me you didn' t know[ br ] about this .
i don' t know[ br ] what to do here .
ofcourse i didn' t know , [ br ] but you gotta calm down .
this is not that big a deal .
everybody uses[ br ] everybody else' s material .
it' s like this unwritten rule[ br ] or something .
that doesn ' t help me .
we can' t do theirroutine[ br ] at regionals because they' re[ br ] gonna do theirroutine .
come on , tor , [ br ] you need a new routine .
that' s all .
no problem .
just hire a professional[ br ] choreographer .
a choreographer ?
look , just think of it[ br ] as collaboration .
the u. c. a. totally looks[ br ] the other way .
call this guy .
his name is sparky polastri .
pen .
remember nationals last year ?
knows his shit , all right ?
here' s the number .
it' s 555 7219 . [ br ]
thanks , aaron .
you always know[ br ] what to do .
mm hmm .
bye , baby .
who was that ?
my sister .
mmm .
but you' re not[ br ] my sister , are you ?
he says we should hire[ br ] a choreographer .
hello .
hi .
may i please speak[ br ] to sparky polastri ?
he' il need three or four days[ br ] to teach us the routine .
but here' s the thing .
it' s gonna cost us[ br ] $2, 000 .
what , do i have[ br ] the letters a t m[ br ] tattooed on my forehead ?
we were thinking more[ br ] like d a d d y.
maybe i can get 500 .
okay , then we only need[ br ]
1, 500 more by monday .
what' s up , whitney ?
hi .
what' s up , whitney ?

making money from guys[ br ] ogling my goodies .
aw , i didn' t need to hear that .
that was an over share .
hey , torrance .
come here a sec .
we' il just[ br ] get this over with .
my brother wants[ br ] to check out your rack .
you know , [ br ] lbeggedmy mom[ br ] fora brother .

listen , we' re lucky[ br ] he' s even doing this for us .
prepare for total domination !
domination , domination .
y' allready forthis
great .
thanks for coming .
we' re ... [ br ]
don' t speak .
you .
you have weak ankles .
one ofyour calves[ br ] is bigger than the other .
too much makeup .
not enough makeup .
what' s with the skin ?
sunlight " !
male cheerleaders .
enough said .
smile .
don' t smile .
chicken .
good general tone[ br ] and musculature .
report those compliments[ br ] to your ass before[ br ] it gets so big ... it forms its own web site .
and you , i take you[ br ] to be the captain , which means[ br ] you' il probably need[ br ] more work than anyone .
look , you don' t ... [ br ]
but ... [ br ]
shh !
no , no , no .
don' t speak .
don' t think .
listen and learn .
i' m a choreographer .
that' s what i do .
you ... are cheerleaders .
cheerleaders are dancers[ br ] who have gone retarded .
whatyou do is a tiny , [ br ] pathetic subset ofdancing .
i will attempt to transform[ br ] your robotic routines into poetry ... written with the human body .
follow me or perish , [ br ] sweater monkeys .
i wantyou to think[ br ] ofwhatyou ate today .
got it ?
now cut that in half .
this is called a diet .
everyone start one today .
darcy , honey , [ br ] you should stop eating .
you see , when you[ br ] skip a meal , your body[ br ] feeds off its fat stores .
and ifyou skip enough , [ br ] maybe your body[ br ] will eat your ass .
why does everyone[ br ] have togo on a diet ?
because in cheerleading , [ br ] we throw people in the air , and fat people don' t go as high .
come on , come on .
let' sget back to work !
ah !
i want dangerous !
i wanna feellikesomebody' s[ br ] gonna snap theirneck !
spirit fingers !
give mespirit fingers !
spirit fi ngers .
give me spirit !
ouch !
what ?
i told you[ br ]
i' d catch you .
look , i understand[ br ] you have underwear[ br ] up your ass right now , but it beats the hell[ br ] out ofa shattered skull .
think about it .
okay , now , [ br ] spirit fi ngers .
spirit fi ngers !
andspirit fingers !
oh , my god !
these are not[ br ] spirit fi ngers .
these are spirit fi ngers .
and these ... are gold .
one , two , three , four , [ br ] five , six , seven , eight .
one , two , three , four , [ br ] five , six , seven , eight .
screw this .
i did not sign on[ br ] for spirit fi ngers .
come on !
the spirit fi ngers are great !
yeah , whatever .
we are so screwed .
hey .
what' s the matter ?
hey .
you don' t wanna know .
ah .
cheer crisis .
i' vejust gotten[ br ] so bogged down[ br ] in all this ... crap .
well , if it' s crap , [ br ] why do you do it ?
i don' t know .
so quit .
maybe i should .
yeah , i mean , ifyou[ br ] don' t like it anymore .
i didn' t say that .
sounds like it .
i don' t know what i want .
irememberback[ br ] when icheeredat[ br ] myschoolin detroit .
you cheered[ br ] at your other high school ?
no , i never cheered , [ br ] but i know what[ br ] you' re going through .
and regardless[ br ] ofall the politics[ br ] and the doubts ... and the crap , you just have to know[ br ] that you can do it .
and if it helps ,
i know you can .
you do ?
yeah .
allright , allright !
i' m ready to make[ br ] a foolofmyself .
state regionals , [ br ] here we come .

leave me alone !
stop it , courtney !
hi .
you , yes .
your head was down .
your head was down[ br ] during that move .
how are you gonna[ br ] give a proper score ... ifyour head is down[ br ] during a move ?
remember , they give[ br ] extra points for alacrity[ br ] and effulgence .
did we bring those ?
oh , no .
look who' s here .
hi .
we' re in trouble .
andnow , [ br ] making theirfirst appearance[ br ] at the u. c. a. california regionals , the east compton clovers !
yeah , clovers !
i' m standing here[ br ] with five time national[ br ] returning champions , the rancho carne toros .
leading the squad this year[ br ] is senior torrance shipman .
torrance , one ofthe things[ br ] we' ve come to expect ... from the toros over[ br ] the last fewyears is[ br ] a highly originalroutine .
can we expect[ br ] thesame thisyear ?
well ,
i think everyone[ br ] goes out there[ br ] the same way , being as prepared[ br ] as they can be and[ br ] just hoping for the best .
we' rejust glad[ br ] to be back here ... and eager to see[ br ] what other squads[ br ] have come up with .
prepare fortotaldomination !

that was , um , [ br ] interesting .

y' all should' vejust stuck[ br ] with our routines .
yeah .
don' t worry .
we' il send you[ br ] a postcard from nationals .
six , seven , eight .
next up , the fighting beavers[ br ] ofsan bernardino .
torranceshipman ?
yes .
tad freeman , universal cheer[ br ]
association .
we have a problem .
a problem ?
oh , yes , [ br ] a verybigproblem .
hey .
idon' t know[ br ] ifyou can imagine ... [ br ]
hey . the incredible sense ofdeja vu[ br ] lexperiencedasl was watching[ br ] that last routine .
it tends to make me[ br ] suspicious ... [ br ]
i wouldn' tjust now .
what ?
official cheer business .
come on .
it' s me .
hey , torrance !
you see , i ... [ br ]
that was smooth .
real smooth .
i' il see her later .
all righty .
oh , uh , by the way , [ br ] nice spirit fi ngers .
yeah .
well , here' s another .
thanks .
obviously your toros[ br ] aren' t the only squad with[ br ] this particular routine .
does the name[ br ]
sparky polastri[ br ] mean anything to you ?
sparky polastri ?
mm hmm .
apparently he' s been peddling[ br ] this same routine up and down[ br ] the california coast .
six squads total .
we' re holding[ br ] an emergency session[ br ] ofthe discretionary panel .
about what ?
we' ve never had a situation[ br ] like this before .
we really should[ br ] disqualify you and ... [ br ]
no , don' t punish the squad .
it was my choice[ br ] to hire sparky , not theirs .
don' t penalize everyone[ br ] for my bad judgment .
but since there' s[ br ] no precedent for this , there' s nothing[ br ] in the rule books[ br ] that forbids it .
it' s simply frowned upon , and i suppose[ br ] we can' t disqualify you[ br ] on those grounds alone .
as defending champions , [ br ] you are guaranteed[ br ] a bid to florida , but know that we' il[ br ] be watching you .
and don' t expect[ br ] to show up at fi nals[ br ] with that routine .
taking the floornow ...
what areyou doing ?
you' re wrecking[ br ] everything lbuilt !
it' s not totally herfault .
this season should have[ br ] been gravy , okay ?
i handpicked the squad , [ br ]
i delivered[ br ] an idiot proof routine .
platter , nationals , hello !
don' t you mean[ br ] a stolen routine ?
oh .
don' t be[ br ] so naive , torrance .
look , the truth is[ br ]
i was a real leader , okay ?
i did what i had to do[ br ] to win at nationals , and ever since i handed[ br ] the reins over to you , you' ve run[ br ] my squad into the ground !
if i made any mistake[ br ] as a squad leader , [ br ] it wasn' t borrowing cheers .
it was announcing you[ br ] as my successor .
uh uh .
not cool .
hey , tor .
tor .
wait , [ br ] wait , wait , wait , wait .
let me go .
i just[ br ] wanna get out of here .
hey , big red' s a bitch .
we all know that .
even she knows that .
i don' t know[ br ] what to do here , aaron .
look .
i know i haven' t[ br ] always been there foryou[ br ] since i went to college .
it' s been[ br ] a rough transition , [ br ] for both of us .
but i still care about you[ br ] as much as i ever did .
you know that , right ?
you do ?
ofcourse .
which is why i hate[ br ] to see you like this , [ br ] all stressed out .
it' s not good foryou .
you' re a great cheerleader , [ br ]
tor , and you' re cute as hell .
it' sjust that maybe ... [ br ]
maybe ... you' rejust not[ br ] captain material , and there' s nothing[ br ] wrong with that .
maybe you should consider[ br ] letting courtney and whitney[ br ] take over the squad .
they' rejust like big red .
you want me[ br ] to give up captain ?
hey , let them deal[ br ] with the politics .
you just do[ br ] what you do best , tor .
you cheer .
cheer , tor .
okay ?
i just wanna see you happy .
bye .
mm .
mmm .
sleep tight , sweetie .
friend ofyours ?
he' s my boyfriend .
look , cliff , [ br ]
i can explain .
no .
it' s cool .
here , um , [ br ]
i made you a tape too .
cliff ...
hey , torrance , uh , [ br ] it' s me , cliff .
um , here' s , uh ...
i wrotesomething , uh , [ br ] foryou , so here it is .
oh , torrance
can' t stand[ br ] yourcheerleading squad
but ilove[ br ] yourpom poms
i' dfeedyou bonbons[ br ] allnight
one , two , three , four !
yeah , yougot me to feel[ br ] all those butterflies inside
inyourlockerl wouldhide[ br ]

it' s onlyyou isee
andyou' rejust[ br ] what ineed

just to rollyou[ br ] in the hay

' causeyou' rejust[ br ] what ineed
andyou' rejust[ br ] what ineed
not everything[ br ] works asit seems
is thatso hard[ br ] to believe
yeah
aaron called us[ br ] last night .
he told us[ br ] you' re turning[ br ] the squad over to us .
just because you bit[ br ] the big one as captain , does not mean[ br ] we' re gonna be[ br ] super hard on you .
oh .
we' il treat you[ br ] as ifyou ... didn' t screw us[ br ] into the ground .
gee , thanks .
everyone .
torrance is not[ br ] to be harmed .
we' ve already decided[ br ] on a course ofaction .
we' re gonna forego[ br ] nationals this year .
everyone' s[ br ] already agreedto it .
uh , except me .
and me !
both ofyou can be replaced .
the onlyperson who can[ br ] officially resign thepost[ br ] ofcaptain is the captain , and i' m not[ br ] going anywhere .
then we' il have[ br ] to overthrow you .
which we will !
enough !
our whole cheering career , [ br ] we' ve stakedourreputation[ br ] on being the best , the most inventive .
now we fi nally have a chance[ br ] to truly be original , [ br ] and you' re all running scared .
she' s crazy .
you' re gonna have[ br ] to kill me fi rst .
that can be arranged .
shut it , whitney !
let her talk !
look , lknowl' ve screwedup[ br ] royally as captain , but lbelieve in this squad , [ br ] andlknow we can[ br ] bounce backfrom this .
i' m not saying[ br ] it' s gonna be easy .
it' s gonna be hard work .
we need a new routine , [ br ] something amazing and fresh , and we' ve got less than[ br ] three weeks till nationals , but ifwe can do it , [ br ] ifwe can pull this off , then we can really[ br ] call ourselves original .
now who' s with me ?
all right !
yeah .
yeah !
yeah !
how ' bout it , girls ?
it' s gonna be hard[ br ] without you two .
fine .
sure .
whatever .
okay .
let' s do this .
we' re gonna devote[ br ] every waking hourtopractice ... before school , [ br ] in between classes[ br ] andafterschool .
afternoonpractices[ br ] willhave to be twice aslong .
we' ve gotta do[ br ] whateverit takes to be[ br ] in perfectphysicalshape .
yeah .
you can go[ br ] a little harder .
yeah , that feelsgood .
maybe we should[ br ] join the squad .
push .
oh , yeah .
fag !
andsince[ br ] the football team sucks[ br ] no matterhowhard we cheer , we' il use nightgames[ br ] topractice too .
but that' s not all .
we' re gonna study[ br ] othertypes ofmovement , [ br ] from swing dance ... to interpretive dance , [ br ] ... you grow and you[ br ] grow and you bloom ! even mime .
we' ildrawinspiration[ br ] from martialarts , [ br ]
hah ! musicals , everything .
youguys know[ br ] we' ve got the talent .
we' vejustgotta work ourasses[ br ] offandtrust ourinstincts ... [ br ] all ofourinstincts .
clattering ]
tor !
wha ...
wow !
what are you doing here ?
just wanted to[ br ] come by and see you .
is this a bad time ?
yeah .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
i' m super busy .
i' m workin ' [ br ] on this project ...
yeah , you sound super busy .
i guess that' s it .
you were too busy[ br ] to believe in me .
oh .
no , no , but wait .
you weren' t too busy[ br ] to sell me out to courtney[ br ] and whitney , were you ?
gee , now i' m confused .
well , i hope you' re not[ br ] too busy to hear this .
kiss my ass , aaron !
it' s over !
you' re a great[ br ] cheerleader , aaron .
it' sjust that ... maybe you' re not exactly[ br ] boyfriend material .
bye bye .
you' re a cheerleader ?
u. c. a. just posted the nationals[ br ] list on the internet .
east compton isn' t on it .
they couldn ' t raise[ br ] the money in time .
they' re not going .
what do you mean , [ br ]
they' re not going " ?
torrance , [ br ] that' sgoodnews .
they cannot not go .
that' s not good news .
what are you talking about ?
they don' t go , we win .
once again we' re the best .
i defi ne best as competing[ br ] against the best there is[ br ] out there and beating them .
they have to go .
it' s so unfair .
the fi rst[ br ] inner city squad to get a bid , [ br ] and they can' t afford to go ?
look , mom .
her head is spinning[ br ] off into another dimension .
justin !
the company gets hit up[ br ] for money all the time , honey .
i just can' t .
it' s not that much money , [ br ]
mr. level playing field .
tell them the deal .
maybe they' il wanna help .
yeah ?
okay , [ br ]
i' il make the call , but they' il probably[ br ] say no .
don' t let them .
think of how much[ br ] it' il mean to east compton .
they deserve to go .
do the right thing , dad !
did that[ br ] just happen ?
yeah .
where we come from , [ br ] ' cheer ' is not a word[ br ] we hear very often .
they should call us[ br ] ' inspiration leaders ' [ br ] instead .
oh , that' s deep .
i like that .
i don' t know why[ br ] we writin ' to some[ br ] talk show host .
it' s like we beggin ' [ br ] for charity .
it' s not charity .
pauletta patton' s[ br ] from our neighborhood .
she' il understand[ br ] why we need the money .
tell her we need to buy donuts .
her big butt[ br ] will understand that .
ha ha !
stop being[ br ] counterproductive , all right ?
lava , please ... stop teaching her[ br ] these big words[ br ] before she choke on one .
no , better i choke you , lafred .
look , jenelope ... [ br ]
you guys , stop !
please .
damn !
well , tell her about[ br ] the late night practices[ br ] we been having .
there you go .
that' s the kind ofstuff[ br ] she wants to hear about .
now we' re talkin ' .
you guys have to go[ br ] to nationals .
did you come up here[ br ] just to tell me that ?
here .
i got my dad' s company[ br ] to sponsoryou guys .
what is this , hush money ?
no .
oh , right .
it' sguilt money .
you pay our way in[ br ] and you sleep better[ br ] at night ... knowing how your whole world[ br ] is based on one[ br ] big , old fat lie .
well , you know what ?
we don' t need you .
why do you have to be so mean ?
i' m just trying to do[ br ] the right thing here .
i' m trying to be strong[ br ] for my squad , okay ?
that' s what a captain does .
well , i' m a captain too , [ br ] you know , and i' m trying[ br ] to make it right .
you wanna[ br ] make it right ?
then when you go to nationals , [ br ] bring it .
don' t slack off because[ br ] you feel sorry for us .
that way , when we beat you , [ br ] we' il know it' s because[ br ] we' re better .
i' il bring it .
don' t worry .
i never do .
yeah , your parents[ br ] just have to sign it .
i didn' t do[ br ] anything !
bye .
bye , tor .
i listened to your tape .
i loved it .
great .
can i talk to you ?
i was upset that night .
aaron gave me a ride home .
it wasjust[ br ] a good night kiss .
it meant nothing .
oh .
i' m sorry .
and i wanted you[ br ] to know that ... [ br ]
i broke up with him .
congratulations .
he didn' t[ br ] believe in me .

torrance likes you .
