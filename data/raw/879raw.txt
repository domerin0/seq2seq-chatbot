i would like , if i may ... ... to take you on a strange journey .
it seemed a fairly ordinary night ... ... when brad majors and his fiance , janet weiss ... ... two young , ordinary , healthy kids ... ... left denton that late november evening ... ... to visit a dr. everett scott ... ... ex tutor and now friend to both of them .
it' s true there were dark storm clouds ... ... heavy , black and pendulous ... ... toward which they were driving .
it' s true also that the spare tire they carried ... ... was badly in need of some air .
but they , being normal kids and ... ... on a night out ... ... they were not going to let a storm spoil the events of their evening .
on a night out .
it was a night out ... ... they were going to remember ... ... for a very long time .
<i>i have never been a</ i> q<i>uitter , </ i>
<i>to leave office before my term</ i> <i>is completed is abhorrent ... </ i> <i> ... to every instinct in my body , </ i>
<i>but as president ... </ i> <i> ...
i must put the interests</ i> <i>of america first , </ i>
<i>america needs a full time president ... </ i> <i> ... and a full time congress ... </ i> <i> ... particularly at this time ... , </ i>
gosh , that' s the third motorcyclist that' s passed us .
they sure do take their lives in their hands .
yes , janet .
life' s pretty cheap to that type .
what' s the matter , brad , darling ?
we took the wrong fork a few miles back .
oh .
where did that motorcyclist come from ?
i guess we' il just have to turn back .
what was that bang ?
we must have a blowout .
damn it !
i knew i should' ve gotten that spare tire fixed .
you stay here and i' il go for help .
we' re in the middle of nowhere .
didn' t we pass a castle a few miles back ?
maybe they have a telephone i could use .
i' m going too .
both of us don' t need to get wet .
i' m coming with you .
besides , the owner of that phone might be a beautiful woman ... ... and you might never come back again .
<i>in the velvet darkness</ i>
<i>of the blackest night</ i>
<i>burning bright</ i>
<i>there' s a guiding star</ i>
<i>no matter what</ i>
<i>or ... </ i> <i> ... who you are</ i>
<i>there' s a light</ i>
<i>over at the frankenstein place</ i>
<i>there' s a light</ i>
<i>burning in the fireplace</ i>
<i>there' s a light , light</ i>
<i>in the darkness</ i>
<i>of everybody' s life</ i>
<i>the darkness must go</ i>
<i>down the river</ i>

and so ... ... it seemed that fortune had smiled on brad and janet ... ... and they had found the assistance that their plight required .
or had they ?
brad , let' s go back .
i' m cold and i' m frightened .
just a moment , janet .
they may have a phone .
hello .
hi !
my name' s brad majors .
this is my fiance , janet weiss .
i wondered if you might help us .
our car broke down up the road .
do you have a phone we might use ?
you' re wet .
yes , it' s raining .
yes .
oh .
i think , perhaps , you better both come inside .
you' re too kind .
i' m frightened .
what kind of place is this ?
it' s probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos .
this way .
are you having a party ?
you' ve arrived on a rather special night .
it' s one of the master' s affairs .
oh .
lucky him .
you' re lucky .
he' s lucky , i' m lucky , we' re all lucky !

mercy !
how did it happen ?
i understood you were to be watching .
i was only away for a minute , master .
well , see if you can find him on the monitor .
master .
master , we have a visitor .
hey , scotty !
dr. everett scott .
you know this earthling ... ... this person ?
i most certainly do .
he happens to be an old friend of mine .
i see .
so this wasn' t simply a chance meeting .
you came here with a purpose .
i told you , my car broke down .
i was telling the truth .
i know what you told me , brad .
but this dr. everett scott , his name is not unknown to me .
he was a science teacher at denton high .
and now he works for your government .
he' s attached to the bureau of investigation ... ... of that which you call u<i>f</ i>os !
isn' t that right , brad ?
he might be .
i don' t know .
the intruder is entering the building , master .
he' il probably be in the zen room .
shall we inquire of him in person ?
great scott !
<i>f</ i>rank n. <i>f</ i>urter .
we meet at last .
dr. scott !
brad !
what are you doing here ?
don' t play games , dr. scott .
you know perfectly well what brad majors is doing here .
it was part of your plan , was it not ?
that he and his female should check the layout for you ?
well , unfortunately for you all , the plans are to be changed .
i hope you' re adaptable , dr. scott .
i know brad is .
i assure you , brad' s presence comes as a complete surprise to me .
i came here to find eddie .
eddie ?
i' ve seen him .
he' s ...
eddie ?
what do you know of eddie ?
i know a great deal about a lot of things .
you see , eddie happens to be my nephew .
dr. scott .
janet !
dr. scott !
janet !
brad !
rocky !
janet !
dr. scott !
janet !
brad !
rocky !
listen !
i made you ... ... and i can break you just as easily .
master , dinner is prepared !
excellent .
under the circumstances , formal dress is to be optional .
the breaking of bread , the last meal of the condemned man ... ... and now this meal .
<i>however informal it might appear ... </ i> <i> ... you can be sure there was to be</ i> <i>very little bonhomie , </ i>
a toast .
to absent friends .
to absent friends .
and rocky .
<i>happy birthday to you</ i>
<i>happy birthday to you</ i>
<i>happy birthday , dear rocky</ i>
<i> happy birthday ... </ i>
shall we ?
we came here to discuss eddie .
eddie !
it' s a rather tender subject .
another slice , anyone ?
excuse me .
i knew he was in with a bad crowd , but it was worse than i imagined .
aliens !
dr. scott !
go on , dr. scott .
or should i say dr. von scott ?
just what exactly are you implying ?
it' s all right !
that' s all right , brad .
<i>from the day he was born</ i>
<i>he was trouble</ i>
<i>he was the thorn</ i>
<i>in his mother' s side</ i>
<i>she tried in vain</ i>
<i>but he never caused her</ i> <i>nothing but shame</ i>
<i>he left home ... </ i> <i> ... the day she died</ i>
<i>from the day she was gone</ i>
<i>all he wanted</ i>
<i>was rock ' n ' roll porn</ i>
und <i>a motorbike</ i>
<i>shooting up junk</ i>
<i>he was a low down , cheap little punk</ i>
<i>taking everyone for a ride</ i>
<i>when eddie said</ i> <i>he didn ' t like his teddy</ i>

<i>but when he threatened your life</ i> <i>with a switchblade knife</ i>
<i> what a guy</ i> <i> makes you cry</ i>
und <i>i did</ i>
<i>everybody shoved him</ i>
<i>i very nearly loved him</ i>
<i>i said , hey , listen to me</ i>
<i>stay sane inside insanity</ i>
<i>but he locked the door</ i> <i>and threw away the key</ i>
<i>but he must' ve been drawn</ i>
<i>into something</ i>
<i>making him warn me</ i>
<i>in a note which reads : </ i>
<i>what' s it say ?

<i>" i' m out of my head</ i>
<i>oh , hurry , or i may be dead</ i>

shut up !
<i>i' il tell you once</ i> <i>i won ' t tell you twice</ i>
<i>you' d better wise up</ i> <i>janet weiss</ i>

<i>i' ve laid the seed</ i> <i>it should be all you need</ i>

<i>you got a block</ i> <i>well , take my advice</ i>
<i>you' d better wise up</ i> <i>janet weiss</ i>
<i>the transducer</ i> <i>will seduce ya</ i>
my feet !
i can' t move my feet !
my wheels !
my god , i can' t move my wheels .
it' s as if we were glued to the spot .
you are .
so quake with fear , you tiny fools .
we' re trapped .
<i>it' s something you' il get used to</ i> <i>a mental mind fuck can be nice</ i>
no !
you won' t find earth people the easy mark you imagine .
this sonic transducer ... ... it is some kind of audio vibratory , physiomolecular transport device ?
you mean ... ?
yes , brad .
it' s something we ourselves have been working on for a while .
but it seems our friend here has found a means of perfecting it .
a device capable of breaking down solid matter ... ... and then projecting it through space , and who knows ... ... perhaps even time itself !
he' s gonna send us to another planet ?
planet schmanet , janet .
<i>you' d better wise up</ i> <i>janet weiss</ i>

my god !
i can' t stand any more of this .
<i>f</ i>irst , you spurn me for eddie , then you toss him like an old coat for rocky .
you chew people up and then you spit them out again .
i loved you .
do you hear me ?
i loved you .
and what did it get me ?
i' il tell you , a big nothing .
you' re like a sponge .
you drain others of their love and emotion .
well , i' ve had enough !
choose between me and rocky , so named because of the rocks in his head .
it' s not easy , having a good time .
even smiling makes my face ache .
and my children turn on me .
rocky' s behaving just the way that eddie did .
maybe i made a mistake ... ... splitting his brain between the two of them .
i grow weary of this world !
when shall we return to transylvania ? !
magenta ... ... i am indeed grateful to both you and your brother , riff raff .
you have both served me well .
loyalty such as yours shall not go unrewarded .
you' il discover that when the mood takes me , i can be quite generous .
i ask for nothing , master .
and you shall receive it in abundance !
come .
we are ready for the floorshow .
<i>and so , by some extraordinary</ i> <i>coincidence ... </ i> ... fate , it seemed , had decided that brad and janet ... ... should keep that appointment with their friend dr. everett scott .
but it was to be in a situation ... ... which none of them could have possibly foreseen .
and just a few hours after announcing their engagement ... ... brad and janet had both tasted ... ... forbidden fruit .
this in itself was proof ... ... that their host was a man of little morals ... ... and some persuasion .
what further indignities were they to be subjected to ?
and what of the floorshow that had been spoken of ?
in an empty house ... ... in the middle of the night ?
what diabolical plan ... ... had seized <i>f</ i>rank' s crazed imagination ?
what indeed ?
<i>f</ i>rom what had gone before , it was clear ... ... that this was to be no picnic .

how sentimental .
and also presumptuous of you .
you see , when i said " we " ... ... were to return to transylvania ... ... i referred only to magenta and myself .
i' m sorry , however , if you found my words misleading ... ... but you see ... ... you are to remain here .
in spirit anyway .
good heavens , that' s a laser .
yes , dr. scott .
a laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti matter .
you' re going to kill him ?
what' s his crime ?
you saw what became of eddie .
society must be protected .
exactly , dr. scott .

no .

you killed them .

they liked you .
they didn' t like me !
they never liked me !
you did right .
a decision had to be made .
you' re okay by me .
dr. scott ... ... i' m sorry about your nephew .
eddie ?
yes , well , perhaps it was for the best .
you should leave now , dr. scott , while it is still possible .
we are about to beam the entire house ... ... back to the planet of transsexual ... ... in the galaxy of transylvania .

our noble mission is almost completed ... ... my most beautiful sister .
