my name is turkish .
funny name for an englishman , i know .
my parents were on the same plane when it crashed .
that' s how they met .
they named me after the plane .
not many people are named after a plane crash .
that' s tommy .
he tells people he was named after a gun .
but i know he was really named after a famous 19th century ballet dancer .
known him for as long as i can remember .
he' s my partner .
doesn' t mean we hold hands or take walks .
it means i try to keep him out of as much trouble as he inflicts on me .
i give him a hard time .
keeps him in check .
but really , he' s like my brother .
what do i know about diamonds ?
i' m a boxing promoter .
what do i know about diamonds ?
don' t they come from antwerp ?
himy , would you listen to this ?
do we have a choice ?
it wasn' t meant to be taken literally .
it' s a nice story , adam and eve .
it' s bound with moral fibre ... ... but asking a grown man to believe it ?
what is it ?
well , what is it ?
what you want i should do , drop my pants ?
okay , go through .
it' s a nice story .
it' s just that .
just a story .
catholic religion is based on a mistranslation .
enough already .
ruben , say something .
listen .
are you busy ?
i' il tell you the whole story .
the septuagint scholars mistranslated the hebrew word for " young woman " ... ... into the greek word for " virgin .
it was an easy mistake to make ... ... because there was only a subtle difference in the spelling .
behold , the virgin shall conceive and bear us a son .
you understand ?
it was " virgin " that caught people' s attention .
it' s not everyday a virgin conceives and bears a son .
but leave that for a couple of hundred years to stew ... ... and next thing you know you have the holy catholic church .
oy vay , what are you saying ?
i' m saying , just because it' s written ... ... doesn' t make it so .
gives them hope .
it' s not important whether it' s fact or fiction .
people like to believe .
i don' t want to hear anymore .
anyway , who is it that we' re seeing ?
michael .
hello ?
mutti .
rudy !
rud , rud , let them in , please .
rud , it' s okay , let them through .
michael .
mutti .
you' ve kept us waiting for half an hour .
are you trying to give me heartburn ?
lie down on the floor .
get on the floor !
lie on the floor !
get on the fucking floor !
get down !
get fucking down !
down on the floor !
get down !
on the ground !
get down , i say !
time .
seven minutes !
where is the stone ?
where is the stone ?
where is the stone ?
michael , where is the stone ?
when does your plane leave ?
twenty minutes .
give me your gun .
when you get to london ... ... if you want a gun ... ... call this number .
boris .
boris .
he can get you anything you need .
ls he allowed to do that ?
it' s an unlicensed boxing match .
it' s not a tickling competition .
these lads are out to hurt each other .
what' s with those sausages , charlie ?
two minutes , turkish .
look at it .
how am i supposed to run this thing from that ?
we' il need a proper office .
i want a new one .
you' re going to buy it for me .
why me ?
well , you know about caravans .
how' s that ?
you spent a summer in one .
which means you know more than me .
and i don' t want to have me pants pulled down over the price .
what' s wrong with this one ?
oh , nothing , tommy .
it' s tiptop .
i' m just not sure about the colour .
it' s all arranged .
you just got to pick it up .
here' s an address .
it' s a campsite .
you' ve got 10 grand , and it would be nice to see change .
what' s happening with them sausages ?
five minutes .
it was two minutes five minutes ago .
they ain' t pikeys , are they ?
i fucking hate pikeys .
you' re a sensitive boy , tommy .
fuck me .
hold tight .
what' s that ?
it' s me belt .
no , tommy .
there' s a gun in your trousers .
what' s a gun doing in your trousers ?
it' s for protection .
protection from what ?
zee " germans ?
what' s to stop it blowing your bollocks off when you sit ?
where did you get it ?
boris the blade .
you mean boris the sneaky , fucking russian .
heavy , isn' t it ?
heavy is good .
heavy is reliable .
lf it doesn' t work , you can always hit him with it .
boris the blade , or boris the bullet dodger .
bent as the soviet sickle and hard as the hammer that crosses it .
apparently , it' s just impossible to kill the bastard .
back to my partner , tommy .
tommy runs the other business ... ... the slot machines ... ... which keeps rain off our heads and gloves on gorgeous ' hands .
however , tommy' s a little preoccupied with protection at present .
all right , i' il take it .
there' s a reason for tommy' s newfound enthusiasm for firearms .
brick top .
lf that' s not worth a bet , i don' t know what is .
he doesn' t look bad , does he ?
no , he looks great .
he' il do you proud .
you reckon that' s what people should do for me , gary ?
do me proud ?
it' s what you deserve .
pull your tongue out of my arsehole .
dogs do that .
you' re not a dog , are you ?
no .
no , i' m not .
however ... ... you do have all the characteristics of a dog , gary .
all except loyalty .
it' s rumoured that his favourite means of dispatch involves a stun gun ... ... a plastic bag , a roll of tape and a pack of hungry pigs .
you' re a ruthless little cunt , liam .
i' il give you that .
but i got no time for grouses .
feed him to the pigs , errol .
what the fuck are you two looking at ?
if you got to deal with him , just make sure you don' t end up owing him .
then you' re in his debt .
which means , you' re in his pocket .
and once you' re in that , you ain' t ever coming out .
i hear he' s a good fighter , so i' il use him .
i' il be doing you a favour , boy .
what he means is , i' m doing him a favour .
because everybody knows nobody takes a dive in my fights .
unlike his .
here , errol , i don' t think he likes me .
you don' t like me , do you ?
don' t know what you mean .
i do know i can' t wait to get out of here .
it stinks .
my fights finish prompt so we can get out before the authorities find out .
play your cards right and i' il sort you out .
you can sort me out by showing me out .
it' s hard to make a living in boxing , so now and then ... ... you do something against your principles .
basically , you have to forget you got any .
are they lancashire pigs ?
who' s talking to you ?
oh , yeah , tommy .
brick top loves tommy .
don' t let me down .
you don' t want to let me down , do you ?
see you ringside .
boris , franky fucking four fingers ... ... has a diamond the size of a fist .
i have told you it' s in the briefcase connected to his arm .
i sent him to you to buy a gun .
what more do you want me to do , hit him for you ?
but don' t you hit him either .
americans can' t know it was russian .
it will come back to me .
you' re my brother , so think like it .
get somebody else to steal that stone !
i don' t want it getting back to me .
and don' t have him killed .
it will raise suspicion .
so don' t use idiots for the job .
he' il stay in london a couple of days before he goes to new york ... ... so move quick .
okay ?
one more thing .
it might help .
he loves to gamble .
eighty six carats ?
brilliant cut , beautiful make .
a beautiful stone .
you' re a good boy , franky .
and you did a real good job .
now when do you get back ?
i got to move the two grainers here , get a better price .
couple of days .
talk to my cousin dougie .
doug the head ?
and franky ....
and what ?
stay out of those casinos .
you did a goodjob , bubbe .
don' t go screwing it up , all right ?
i hear you , avi .
i' il see you , avi .

london ?
london .
london ?
yes , london .
you know , fish , chips , cup of tea ... ... bad food , worse weather , mary fucking poppins .
london !
not for me .
that' s doug the head .
everybody knows doug the head .
if it' s stones and it' s stolen , he' s the man to speak to .
pretends he' s jewish .
wishes he was jewish .
even tells his family they' re jewish ... ... but he' s about as jewish as he is a fucking monkey .
he thinks it' s good for business .
and in the diamond business ...
... it is good for business .
avi !
he' il be there today .
take care of him .
avi , you know i won' t buy schtrops .
he isn' t selling schtrops .
make it smaller .
who do you take me for ?
this is england .
we play by the rules .
listen to me .
lf the stones are kosher , then i' il buy them , won' t l ?
now , if you' il excuse me , it' s my lunchtime .
bye .
what are you doing here ?
it' s a free country , isn' t it ?
well , it ain' t a free shop , is it ?
so fuck off .
i want to see you two girls up in my office .
i had cousin avi on the phone .

the weight is sign of reliability .
i always go for reliability .
i' il take it .
how much do you want for it ?
nothing .

i want you to do something for me .
there is a fight in couple of days .
what kind of a fight ?
unlicensed boxing .
there is a bookies i know that will take bets .
lf you place one down for me ... ... we will call it quits .
why don' t you put it down yourself ?
well ... ... there is not too many bookies that takes those kind of bets .
and i already have an outstanding debt with the house .
i know something most don' t .
so , nu ?
what do you know ?
it' s a campsite .
a pikey campsite .
ten points .
what are we doing here ?
we' re buying a caravan .

what' s wrong with you ?
this will get messy .

mr. o' neil .

that' s a good lad .
piss off .
are you going to go get him for me ?
yeah .
what are you waiting for ?
the five quid you' il pay me .
fuck off , i' il find him meself .
two fifty .
you can have a quid .
you' re a real tight fucker .
there was a problem with gypsies .
what' re you doing ?
get out of the way , man .
you can' t understand what' s being said .
you tommy ?
come about the caravan ?
mr. o' neil .
fuck , man .
call me mickey .
not irish , not english .
how are you ?
weather' s been kind .
it' s just pikey .
would you look at the size of him ?
how big are you ?
kids , how big is he ?
big , for sure .
hey , mam , come and look at the size of this fella .
bet you box a little , can' t you , sir ?
you look like a boxer .
get out of the way .
see if they' d like a drink .
i could murder one .
be no murdering done around here , i don' t mind telling you .
get your hands out of there .
cup of tea for the big fella ?
don' t be silly , mickey .
offer the man a proper drink .
you little bugger .
ls the big fella not coming with us ?
he' s minding the car .
what does he think we are , thieves ?
no , nothing like that .
he just likes looking after cars .
good dags .
do you like dags ?
dags ?
what ?
yeah , dags .
dags .
you like dags ?
oh , dogs .
sure , i like dags .
i like caravans more .
you' re very welcome .
pikeys are well known for their skills of negotiation in business .
it' s probably why they talk like that ... ... so you can' t follow what' s being said .
but if tommy can get the caravan for less than the price asked ... ... on his return there will be ice cream .
good dog , good family .
he' il get a little homesick , but he' il get over it .
see you later , lads .
see you , boss .
all right , mickey .
laters .
i don' t see what the fuss is about .
they aren' t bad fellas .
the deal was , you bought it how you saw it .
look , i' ve helped you as much as i' m going to help you .
see that car ?
use it .
you should fuck off now while you still got the legs to carry you .
nobody brings you ... ... unless they' re trying to say something without talking .
just give our money back and you can keep your caravan .
why do i want a caravan that' s got no wheels ?
you want to settle this with a fight ?
over my dead body .
now , go on !
go on !
i' il not have you fighting !
you know what happens when you fight !
get her to sit down .
for fuck' s sake !
want the money ?
i ain' t fucked you .
i' il fight you for it .
you and me .
so that' s the kind of fight it' il be .
you want to stay down .
you want to stay down !
get back down and fucking stay down .
i promise you , you want to stay down .
deadly kick for a fat fucker , you know that ?
cheeky bastard .
okay , lads .
get him on his feet .
get back down ... ... or you will not be coming up next time .
bollocks to you .
this is sick .
i' m out of here .
you' re not going anywhere , you thick lump .
you stay until the job' s done .
it turned out that the sweet talking , tattoo sporting pikey ... ... was a gypsy bare knuckle boxing champion .
which makes him harder than a coffin nail .
right now that' s the last thing on tommy' s mind .
if gorgeous doesn' t wake up in the next few minutes ... ... tommy knows he' il be buried with him .
why would the gypsies want to explain ... ... why a man died in their campsite ?
not when they can bury the pair of them and just move camp .
it' s not like they got social security numbers , is it ?
tommy , " the tit " ... ... is praying .
and if he isn' t ... ... he fucking should be .
bad boy .
sol .
easy .
no , it' s a moissanite .
a what ?
a moissanite is an artificial diamond , lincoln .
it' s mickey mouse .
spurious .
not genuine .
and it' s worth ... ... fuck all .
bad boy , i keep telling you , stick to being a gangster .
leave this game to me and sol .
laters .
what is that , vince ?
this is a dog , sol .
you are not bringing that thing in here .
it' s only a fucking dog .
where' d you get it ?
the gyppos .
here .
they threw it in with the moody gold .
you know gyppos , sol .
they' re always throwing dogs in with deals .
it better not be dangerous .
what do you think you' re doing now ?
i want him to get used to the shop , don' t l ?
stop the dog !
come back !
all right , boris ?
don' t worry about the dog .
i' m not .
what can i do for you ?
i have a job for you .
i already have a job .
fifty grand for half a day' s work .

of course i am .
tyrone' il drive for us .
he' s done a rally driving course .
of course i have .
i don' t want that dog dribbling on my seats .

tyrone , this is a stolen car , mate .
while i' m at the wheel , it' s my car ... ... so stop that dog dribbling on my seats .
all right ?
i can' t believe you found it .
where' d it go ?
it went back to the gyppos .
shut up .
and how could it find them ?
well , i don' t know .
i' m not a dog , sol .
ask him .
it' s like he' s a fucking homing beacon .
steady on the brakes .
i thought you said he could drive , sol .
don' t worry about me .
just worry about that dog on my seats .
all right ?
what ?
you said he was a getaway driver .
what the fuck can he get away from ?
don' t worry about tyrone .
he can move when he has to .
worry about getting us a gun .
what' s that ?
this is a shotgun , sol .
it' s a fucking anti aircraft gun , vincent .
i want to raise pulses , don' t l ?
you' il raise hell , never mind pulses .
that does not look like a bookies .
why' d we stop here ?
what' s the matter with that space over there ?
it' s too tight .
too tight ?
you could land a jumbo fucking jet in there .
leave him alone .
he' s a natural .
ain' t you , tyrone ?
of course i am .
a natural fucking idiot .
tyrone , what' ve you done ?
yeah , tyrone , what have you done ?
look , you hassle me , you see what happens .
it' s all right .
no , don' t move it now .
people' il see the damage .
why' d you do that ?
i didn' t see it .
it' s a four ton truck .
it' s not like it' s a packet of fucking peanuts .
it was at a funny angle .
it' s behind you , tyrone .
whenever you reverse , things come from behind you .
control that dog as well .
get that dog off him .
get it off me .
give me that squeaky toy .
it shut him up last time .
don' t snatch .
he can' t swallow the whole ball .
yeah .
why the fuck ... ... did you put gorgeous george ... ... into a bare knuckle boxing match ... ... two days before he had to fight the bomber ?
he was half his size .
i didn' t expect him to get hurt .
you put the man into a bare knuckle boxing match .
what the fuck did you expect ?
a grease down and a shiatsu ?
who took the jam out of your doughnut ?
you took the fucking jam out of my doughnut .
you did .
you said get a good deal .
i fail to recognize the correlation ... ... between losing 10 grand , hospitalizing gorgeous ... ... and a good deal .
how' il we explain this to brick top ?
that his fight won' t happen ?
we replace the fighter .
oh , and hope he doesn' t notice ?
who the fuck will we replace him with ?
what about john the gun ?
or mad fist willy ?
you' re not mr. current affairs , are you ?
mad fist went mad ... ... and the gun shot himself .
jesus .

brick top runs an illegal bookies .
they take bets on anything that involves blood and pain .
now i' m changing fighters ... ... and brick top' s gonna exploit the situation .
he' s gonna pull my pants down , grease me up ... ... and aim for penetration .
if i didn' t have the replacement pikey ... ... he' d want to split me in half .
they could charm the paint off walls , these fellas .
look mean now , you hairy fucker , won' t you ?

we' ve lost gorgeous george .
well , where' d you lose him ?
he ain' t a set of fucking car keys , is he ?
and it' s not as if he' s incon fucking spicuous , is it ?
we' re not backing out .
you bet your bollocks to a barn dance you' re not .
we' re changing the fighter .

who are you changing him to , sweetheart ?
you won' t know him , but he' s mustard .

yes , he had a case .
and this schmuck is gambling ?

avi , i' m not telepathic .
you' re plenty stupid , i' il give you that .
do you know why they call him franky four fingers ?
i have no idea .
because he makes stupid bets with dangerous people .
when he doesn' t pay up , they give him the chop .
and i' m not talking about his fucking foreskin .
i' m sure he can pay .
not with my goods .
got a toothbrush ?
we' re going to london .
do you hear that ?

i hope you can appreciate the concern i have for my friend franky .
i' il find him , and you' il help me find him .
and we' il start at that fight .
how am i gonna get it out ?
it will probably cough it up .
will he be all right ?
i hope not .
are we gonna rob this bookies ?
yes , big man .
why are we waiting ?
we are waiting for a man with four fingers , carrying a briefcase .
and why' s that ?
because the deal is , the russian gets the case , we get the money .
what' s in the case ?
for fuck' s sake , tyrone , just concentrate on the steering wheel .

stop me again whilst i' m walking and i' il cut your fucking jacobs off .
he' s here .
well , you explain it to him .

the case was attached to his arm .
so why didn' t you chop it off ?
we ain' t fucking butchers , boris .
but he has the case .
look , we well , you have a problem .
there weren' t much cash at the bookies .
okay .
here is the 10 grand .
no .
keep it .
we want this .
well , at least half of this .
what was in the case was mine .
what was in the bookies was yours .
okay ?
it wasn' t much , but here is the 10 large to help the situation .
no , i' m afraid it' s too late for that .
we want half of this , and that' s because we' re being generous .
we could , by all rights , keep the whole fucking stone , boris .
watch out !
drop the gun , fat boy .
you fucking idiots .
he could not know my name .
give me the stone .
it' s in the case .
what ?
it' s in the case .
you put the stone in the case ?
open it and give me the stone .
the only man who knew the combination , you just shot .
now , it' s not too clever to hang about after mickey' s performance .
brick top , in short , will be looking to kill tommy , mickey and myself .
i know he' s looking for us , but i don' t have a choice .
i' m happy to leave the country , but i need money to do so .
but any money i have is in the safe , which is in the office .
once i have that , it' s
oink , oink .
shit .
so that' s where you keep the sugar .
what brings you two here ?
run out of pants to sniff ?
that sounds like hostility , doesn' t it ?
and we don' t like hostility , do we , errol ?
no , we don' t , john .
i just had them polished .
go and put the kettle on .
you take sugar ?
no , thank you , turkish .
i' m sweet enough .
he' s now your problem .
okay ?
you can keep the 10 grand , along with the body ... ... but if i see you again , you motherfuckers ....
well , look at him .
i' ve got a bare knuckle fight in a couple of days .
i want to use the pikey .
all right .
of course .
of course , fucking of course .
i wasn' t asking , i was telling .
but this time ... ... l do want him to go down in the fourth .
and i do mean it , this time .
now , i know you come back here to open your safe .
so now you can open it .
turkish has been a busy little bastard .
i think he' s got away with enough .
thinking can get you into trouble , errol .
i shouldn' t do so much of it .
that takes care of one little piggy .
now find me the silly sods who blagged the bookies .
find them today .
top of the morning to you , mrs. o' neil .
tommy .
you' re a snake in the grass , ain' t you ?
where' d they come from ?
you' re looking for my boy , are you ?
do you know where i can find him ?
yeah .
would you like to share that information ?
i don' t want you getting my boy into trouble .
he' s my only boy .
and he' s a good boy .
he' s coursing .
what' s coursing ?
hare coursing .
they set two lurchers they' re dogs , before you ask .
on a hare .
and the hare has to outrun the dogs .
so , what if it doesn' t ?
well , the big rabbit gets fucked , doesn' t it ?
proper fucked ?
yeah , tommy .
before " zee " germans get there .
do you know these tits , errol ?
i know a lot of tits ... ... but i don' t know any as fucking stupid as these two .
john ?
i can' t help , guv .
tyrone .
you silly , fat bastard .
do you want to do it ?
that depends .
on what ?
on you buying this caravan .
not the rouge one .
the rose .
it' s not the same caravan .
not the same fight .
it' s twice the size of the last one .
the fight is twice the size .
and me ma needs a caravan .
i like to look after me ma .
it' s a fair deal .
take it .
you' re lucky we aren' t worm food after your last performance .
buying a tart' s mobile palace is a little fucking rich .
i wasn' t calling your mum a tart .
i just meant ....
save your breath for cooling your porridge .
right .
and she' s terrible partial to the periwinkle blue .
have i made myself clear ?
yeah , that' s perfectly clear , mickey .
just give me one minute to confer with my colleague .
did you understand a word of what he said ?
i' il tell you what .
fucker .
i' il bet you for it .
you' il what ?
he' il bet you for it .
what , like tommy did last time ?
do me a favour ?
i' il do you a favour .
you have first bet .
lf i win , i get a caravan ... ... and the boys get a pair of them shoes .
lf i lose ... ... fuck it , i' il do the fight for free .
the last thing i really want to do is bet a pikey .
however , i don' t really have much of a choice .
somehow i' ve got to get him to fight , but if i lose ....
well , i don' t even want to think about losing .
okay .
i reckon the hare gets fucked .
what ?
proper fucked ?
you got that , london ?
we' re on !
i' il fucking tell you !
get those off me .
i' il tell you who robbed your bookies .
periwinkle blue .
bye , boys .
who' s proper fucked now , then ?
there' s something very wrong with this .
it was us that wanted to buy a caravan off of him .
well , why didn' t you " bust a cap in his ass " then , tommy ?
mind you , you' d do more damage if you threw it at him .
what ?
you saying i can' t shoot ?
oh , no , tommy .
i wasn' t saying you can' t shoot .
i know you can' t shoot .
what we' re saying is , that piece of shit stuck in your trousers ... ... would do more damage if you fed it to him .
you saying the gun don' t work ?
you tried it ?
whoops .
i want to see that sneaky fucking russian .
why' s he got a tea cosy on his head ?
to keep his head warm .
what happened to him ?
he got shot in the face .
i thought that was obvious .
what' d you do that for ?
you mistake him for a rabbit ?
what do you want me to do ?
sort it out .
i' m not a witch doctor .
but you are a bad boy yardie ... ... and bad boy yardies should know how to get rid of bodies .
i create the bodies , i don' t erase the bodies .
we' re in , governor .
goody gumdrops .
get us a cup of tea , would you , errol ?
grab hold of his legs .
what do you think i' m gonna grab him by , his ears ?
hope this is not a bad moment .
do you know who i am ?
i do .
good .
that will save me some time , then .
well , i don' t .
you' re always gonna have problems lifting a body in one piece .
apparently , the best thing to do ... ... is cut up a corpse into six pieces and pile it all together .
would someone mind telling me , who are you ?
when you got your six pieces , you gotta get rid of them .
it' s no good leaving it in the freezer for your mum to discover .
then i hear the best thing to do is feed them to pigs .
you gotta starve the pigs for a few days ... ... then the chopped up body will look like curry to a pisshead .
you gotta shave the heads of your victims and pull the teeth out ... ... for the piggies ' digestion .
you could do this afterwards , of course ... ... but you don' t want to sieve through pigshit , do you ?
they will go through bone like butter .
you need at least 16 pigs to finish the job in one sitting ... ... so be wary of any man who keeps a pig farm .
they will go through a body that weighs 200 pounds ... ... in about eight minutes .
that means that a single pig ... ... can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh ... ... every minute .
hence the expression ... ... " as greedy as a pig .
well , thank you for that .
that' s a great weight off me mind .
now , if you wouldn' t mind telling me who the fuck you are ... ... apart from someone who feeds people to pigs , of course .
do you know what " nemesis " means ?
a righteous infliction of retribution ... ... manifested by an appropriate agent .
me .
gentlemen ....
why can' t you find me franky , doug ?
avi , what do you want me to do ?
i' m not a bounty hunter .
what about tony ?
bullet tooth tony .
who' s bullet tooth
tony !
you silly fuck .
he' s a liability .
he' d find moses and the burning bush .
you are gonna die , tony !
he got shot six times , had the bullets moulded into gold .
i shoot you , you go down !
he has two in his teeth that dad did , so he loves dad .
why don' t you fucking die ?
he' s the best chance you got .
six times ?
ln one sitting .
you' re in trouble now .
sounds promising .
what are we waiting for ?
bonjour .
what' s so fucking important ?
why do you think we' ve got a dead man ...
... missing an arm in our office ?
talk to me , tell me .
you give us four days ... ... l' il get you a stone the size of a fucking home .
i kid you not .
what do you think , errol ?
i think we should drip dry them , while we got the chance .
it was a rhetorical question , errol .
what have i told you about thinking ?
you got 48 hours .
yeah .
you can keep that silly , fat wanker .
the lads can' t lift him .
forty eight hours .
after that it' s your family ... ... and the pigs finish what the dogs don' t do .
so , what should i call you ?
should i call you " bullet " ?
tooth " ?
call me " susan " if it makes you happy .
tony , there is a man i' d like you to find .
that depends on all the elements in the equation .
how many are there ?
forty thousand .
where was he last seen ?
at a bookies .
bookies ?
pass us the blower , susi .
bookies got blagged last night .
blagged ?
speak english .
this country spawned the language , and nobody seems to speak it .
blagged , robbed .
we' il see a man that may know something .
i need a gun .
you don' t , rosebud , me old son .
you need me .
i got fucking black ink all over fuck boy .
he' s stained for fucking life .
that and the golden teeth as well .
fucking hell
all right , mullet ?
how you doing ?
you all right , mate ?
nice tie .
i heard you weren' t about that much .
still warm , the blood that courses through my veins .
unlike yours , mullet .
who blagged brick top' s bookies ?
do me a favour , tone .
i will do you a favour , mullet .
i' il not bash the fuck out of you in front of all your girlfriends .
gonna make it worth my while , mate ?
jesus , you know how it is , man .
comfortable , mullet ?
it' s sadly ironic it' s that tie that' s got you into this pickle .
now , you take all the time you want , mate .
what the fuck you doing , tone ?
driving down the street with your head in my window .
what you think i' m doing ?
well , don' t , tone .
you been using dog shit for toothpaste ?
slow down , tone .
slow down , tony !
i don' t think so .
i think i' il speed up .
play some music if you like .
i love this track .
i want to know who blagged brick top' s bookies .
yes , mullet ?
i think it' s two black guys that work from a pawn shop in smith street .
better not be telling me porky pies .
i tell you , it' s two black guys work out of a pawnshop on smith street .
it' s very effective , tony .
it' s not too subtle , but effective .
are we taking him with us ?
it' s the russian .
a russian ?
to be technical he' s an uzbekistanian .
uzbekistanian ?
i' ve been dealing with those sneaky russian dogs .
give me a name .
yurinov .
boris .
boris the blade ?
yeah .
as in boris the bullet dodger ?
why do they call him the bullet dodger ?
because he dodges bullets , avi .
he won' t fight unless we buy his mum a caravan ... ... and you nicked all our savings .
ln the quiet words of the virgin mary , come again ?
he' s a stubborn bastard .
he said he' s got to look after his mum .
are you taking the piss ?
what can i do ?
i can' t make him do it , can l ?
you' re not much good to me alive are you , turkish ?
he' s a useless shite , that boy .
punish him for me , errol .
i want that pikey to fight .
brick top thought smashing up our arcade ... ... might help me to persuade mickey to fight .
and if that wasn' t enough ... ... he thought it would be a good idea ... ... to burn mickey' s mum' s caravan .
while she was asleep in it .
turkish , get your arse up .
you lot ... ... follow me and i' il fucking shoot you .
calm down , son .
behave yourself .
i' ve got the gun , son .
i think it' s you who should behave .
what ?
you want to see if i' ve got the minerals ?
jesus .
sorry , mickey .
did you do it ?
then what are you sorry for ?
what are you two doing here ?
come back !
you got some tars on you .
fuck off , darren .
fuck off !
how silly do i feel ?
his mum is still smoking next to us ... ... and i' m asking him to fight .
i' il do the fight before he causes any more carnage .
and if he' d said no ... ... it could' ve been a shite sight worse .
russians .
russians .
i should' ve known .
anti semite , slippery cossack sluts .
what do you know about this goyim ?
ex kgb cancer .
he was a highly trained undercover agent .
he' il be impossible to track down .
yeah .
there' s a strange man who wants to sell us an 84 carat stone .
where' s he from ?
i don' t know .
hard to tell .
he' s got a thick russian accent .
well , what was i supposed to do ?
he set the dogs on me .
look .
that sneaky fucking russian !
no wonder he didn' t want to do it .
first things first .
one of us ... ... tyrone , you go to the russian' s .
the second you see him , call us .
now .
he' s a right handful , this fella , so watch out .
i hate russians .
i' il take care of him .
all yours , rosebud , old son .
not a problem .
get me to a doctor .
shoot that fuck !
then , get me to a doctor .
okay , but first we get the stone .
first the stone .
then a doctor .
and not just any doctor , boychik .
a nice jewish doctor .
find my friend a nice jewish doctor !
get his keys and find out where the stone is .
i think you got something to tell us .
take it easy , rosebud .
do you want him to be able to talk or not ?
what the fuck do you mean , replicas ?
they look the shit , don' t they ?
and nobody is gonna argue .
i' ve got extra loud blanks , just in case .
ln case we have to deafen them to death ?
yeah .
boris is here .
we' re coming over .
hold him there .
hold on !
he' s not on his own !
we' re off .
very industrious for a cossack .
sneaky fucking russian .
so , where is he ?
it' s not just he .
three fellas went in the house .
they locked boris in the car .
why didn' t you tell us that ?
did they look hard ?
they looked messy .
let' s get out of here .
what about the russian ?
i want you to bury him .
all right .
i think we should get you a new gun .
but this time , try it .
how far to the russian' s ?
be there in a minute .
come on , then .
no , no , not so fast , vinny .
we can' t take them now .
we' re gonna have to follow them .
you shouldn' t drink that stuff , anyway .
why ?
what' s wrong with it ?
it' s not in sync with evolution .
shut up .
how do we get rid of him ?
do you want to shoot him ?
it' s a little noisy .
do you want to stab him ?
that' s a little cold blooded .
do you want to kill him or not ?
i' il cut him .
i got a blade .
that' s the spirit .
do they fire ?
of course they fire .
but how do you know ?
they' re replicas .
what do you know about replicas ?
what the fuck are you doing , solomon ?
you wanted to know whether they worked .
i didn' t mean try it in the car , sol , you arsehole !
what are you gonna do with that , pick his teeth ?
wipe the butter off and put it away .
there' s a proper blade back there .
cows have only been domesticated in the last 8000 years .
before , they were running around mad as lorries .
the human digestive system hasn' t got used to any dairy products yet .
well , fuck me , tommy .
what have you been reading ?
let me do you a favour .
whoops .
you .
want a knife ?
no , not me .
i wouldn' t know what to do .
it' s a knife , for god' s sake .
what' s kept your fork company all these years ?
the sharp side , the blunt side .
what do you want , a lesson ?
ls that boris ?
oh , tyrone , what have you done ?
what about rosebud ?
well , you can bring him with you if you like .
but which bit would you like ?
they' re getting out .
get down and follow them .
cover yourself up , avi .
you' re making a scene .
i' m sorry for causing a scene , tony .
whoa , you are not taking that dog with you , vince .
i can' t leave him in here , can l ?
pint of the black stuff , landlord .
i thought you wanted to get cleaned up .
bathroom' s back there .
he' s left the door open .
shouldn' t think that' s a good idea .
should we go in ?
i don' t want to go in there .
he' s a dangerous bastard .
taken too many disco biscuits in the heat of russian disputations .
he' s got as many of these nuts as he has those nuts .
i don' t care if he' s got fucking hazelnuts .
i want a gun that works , and i' m gonna tell him .
my god , tommy , you certainly got those minerals .
well , come on , then before " zee " germans get here .
you just tell him who' s in charge .
boris
you certainly told him .
the drowning trout .
come and pick us up .
and doug ... ... sharpish .
i don' t want a fuss or to put a bullet in your face ... ... but unless you give me what i want there will be fucking murders .
what' s your name ?
shoot him .
let go of the gun !
so , you' re obviously the big dick ... ... and that , on either side of you , are your balls .
there are big brave balls , and there are little faggot balls .
these are your last words so make them a prayer .
dicks have drive and clarity of vision ... ... but they' re not clever .
they smell pussy and they want a piece of the action .
and you thought you smelled some good old pussy ... ... and have brought your two little faggot balls along ... ... for a good old time .
but you' ve got your parties muddled up .
there' s no pussy here ... ... just a dose that' il make you wish you were born a woman .
like a prick ... ... you' re having second thoughts .
you' re shrinking .
and your two little balls are shrinking with you .
the fact that you' ve got " replica " written on the side of your gun ...
... and the fact that i' ve got " desert eagle . 50 " ... ... written on the side of mine ...
... should precipitate ... ... your balls into shrinking , along with your presence .
now ... ... fuck off .
lock the door .
lock it !
give me the case .
fuck you .
shoot me .
i will .
i' il shoot you .
pass me case or i shoot you .
you know what ?
fuck you too .
go ahead and shoot me .
you' d be doing me a favour , you russian fuck .
you !
drop guns .
fuck you !
you drop your gun !
okay .
avi ... ... pull your socks up !
tyrone ?
fuck it .
we' re out of here .
give me case .
avi ...
... where' s the case ?
put the gun away .
what' s boris doing here ?
boris , what are you doing here ?
fuck you !
where' s the case ?
you piece of crap .
don' t take the piss , boris .
i' il show you .
fuck you !
almost had it .
for fuck' s sake .
fuck you and all .
you lucky bastard .
jeez , it' s flawless .
don' t get attached to it .
it' s going to brick top .
leave the dog here .
sol , why don' t we just leave ?
because life' s too short , vincent ... ... and it' il get a lot shorter if brick top wishes .
now leave that dog here .
i' m gonna leave the dog here .
don' t worry about it !
and if that pikey mutt does any damage , you' re gonna pay .
it' s okay .
sit down .
down .
i don' t want to go in there .
you' il never see me again .
well , we won' t if you don' t .
all right , you give me the stone ... ... and i will give it to brick top .
yeah ?
all right .
give me a minute .
it' s a bit fiddly .
why is it down there ?
well , i put it down there in case we got mugged .
you ain' t from this planet , are you ?
who is gonna mug two black fellas holding pistols ... ... sat in a car that' s worth less than your shirt ?
bullet tooth tony and his friend , desert eagle . 50 .
what have they got to do with anything ?
they' re both staring straight at me .
you should never underestimate the predictability of stupidity .
now , out of the car .
and leave your water pistols behind .
look , just tell him the stone' s back at the office .
i' il think of something .
why' s he sweating ?
oh , never mind .
tommy , why is your skin leaking ?
i' m a little worried , actually .
worried about what ?
what happens if the gypsy knocks the other man out ?
i mean , he' s done it before , hasn' t he ?
we get murdered before we leave the building , and we get fed to the pigs .
i' m glad to see you' re climbing the walls in fucking anxiety .
pardon my cynicism , but i don' t exactly trust the pikey .
don' t think i haven' t thunk about that one .
it' s his mum' s funeral tonight .
god bless her .
you know those gypsies like a drink at a wake .
i' m not worried about whether mickey knocks the other man out .
i' m worried about whether he makes it to the fourth round .
what ifhe doesn' t make it to the fourth round ?
we get murdered before leaving the building ... ... and i imagine we get fed to the pigs .
so why are you so calm ?
i said  i heard what you said , tommy !
it' s not as though we' ve got a choice , now , is it ?
you show me how to control a wild fucking gypsy ... ... and i' il show you how to control an unhinged , pig feeding gangster .
bollocks !
i' m going for a walk .
oh , that fucking dog !
go on , get the dog .
it' s a bit funky in here , isn' t it ?
open a window .
you people live like animals .
now , where' s the stone ?
come on , where is it ?
it' s over here .
where ?
where ?
i left it in a box .
it' s empty .
i' m getting heartburn .
tony , do something terrible .
no , i' m being serious !
the dog .
the dog must have had it .
now then , let' s have a look , shall we ?
tony .
what ?
look in the dog .
you mean , " look in the dog " ?
i mean , open him up .
it' s not a tin of baked beans .
what do you mean , open him up ?
you know what i mean .
that' s a bit strong .
i don' t know about this .
no , you can' t do this .
it' s fucking squeaking !
you never heard a dog squeak before ?
give me that goddamn gun !
i' m shooting the dog !
shoot the fucking dog !
you sneaky fucking bastard .
thank god for that .
i hate fucking dogs !
come on , tony .
tony , come on !
tony ?
anything to declare ?
yeah .
don' t go to england .
that dog is gonna go back to the campsite .
it always does .
how' s the dog gonna find the campsite ?
have you smelled the campsite , sol ?
all right .
but we have to wait until it gets light .
and we have to get rid of these bodies .
that one with the tea cosy on his head' s starting to stink .
right .
let' s stick them in the car , and then go and look for a pig farm .
mickey .
mickey !
you feeling all right , mickey ?
need a drink .
you can' t give him a drink !
it' s not for him .
it' s for me .
ah , mates .
amen .
he' s a hard bastard , this good night anderson , so pay attention .
all right , mickey ?
mickey !
need to have a shite !
lf you see the pikey , turkish or his girlfriend come out before me ... ... shoot the bastards .
well , come on .
we got a fight to go to .
all right , tom .
hope we get a better show this time .
this will make up for it .
mickey' s going down in the fourth .
terry over there is in charge of the bets .
now , you have to forgive me .
i' il forgive you if he goes down this time .
our lads at the campsite ?
they' re over there now .
i fucking hate pikeys .
how long have we gotta stay here ?
as long as it takes .
now , shut up .
fucking hate pikeys .
ls he fucking stoned ?
he' s like that before a fight .
do you know when you' re going down ?
of course he knows when he' s going down .
fuck face , who' s speaking to you ?
he asked him , didn' t he ?
fuck face ?
i like that one , errol .
i' il remember that next time i climb off your mum .
not now .
gonna be a tragedy of a fight .
be a nice one .
hell of a way to be a war .
and there none a yours .
there' s a camp full of pikeys that might not think you' re so funny .
not when they' re putting out flames on their children' s backs .
now get up and have a fucking fight .
three rounds and you' re a vegetable , aren' t you , pikey !
i' m in charge here .
no fucking about , no eye gouging .
do your worst .
let' s get it on !
what the fuck' s going on ?
you gonna finish him or what ?
talk about saved by the bell .
do you understand the consequences of knocking that man out ?
do not knock him out , mickey .
all right , let' s break it up .
what , is he fucking deaf ?
what is he doing ?
come on and sit .
what the fuck are you doing , mickey ?
you' re dancing like a fairy .
they' il hang us if they think it' s rigged .
get out there and hurt him .
but for fuck' s sake , do not knock him out .
all he' s got to do is stay down .
now , we are fucked .
he can' t stand up .
we' re out of here .
stupid pikey knows brick top' s got keen to kill monkeys with shotguns ... ... sitting outside his campsite .
once the campsite' s wiped out , i know it' s gonna be the same for us .
ever cross the road and look the wrong way ?
give me that fucking shooter !
and , hey , presto , there' s a car nearly on you .
so , what do you do ?
something very silly .
you freeze .
and your life doesn' t flash before you ... ... because you' re too scared to think .
youjust freeze and pull a stupid face .
but the pikey didn' t .
why ?
because he had plans on running the car over .
it had previously occurred to me ... ... that he' d taken the demise of his mother rather lightly .
for every action , there is a reaction .
and a pikey reaction ... ... is quite a fucking thing .
pete , talk to me .
lf you want your friend to hear you , talk a lot louder than that .
give me that fucking shooter .
i' il give you your shooter , you cunt .
that is when i thought the pikey had money riding on himself .
that' s why the bastard never goes down when he' s supposed to .
we' ve been tucked up ... ... while he' s been cleaning up .
we' re worse off now than when we started .
the next day we went to the campsite ... ... but the gypsies had disappeared during the night .
which was probably a good thing ... ... considering they' d just buried 12 people somewhere in the area .
where is he ?
he ain' t fucking here , that' s for sure .
we can' t ask a man to fight for us if we can' t find him , can we ?
you won' t find a pikey that doesn' t want to be found .
he could be in a campsite in kampu fucking chea by now .
bollocks !
come on .
what you doing here ?
what' s it got to do with you ?
so , what you doing here ?
i' m taking the dog for a walk .
what' s the problem ?
what' s in the car ?
seats and a steering wheel .
what do you know about gypsies ?
i know they' re not to be trusted .
all right , get your dog .
on your way .
get the dog , tommy .
the dog .
all right , boy .
come on .
come on , daisy .
no , daisy !
he loves that dog .
always playing silly games .
stop messing about and get it in the car .
tommy !
good boy .
good boy .
good boy , daisy , good boy .
could you tell me ... ... why you got a dead man with an arm missing in your boot ?
hey , george ... ... is that a tea cosy on his head ?
oh , you love a dog , don' t you , tommy ?
tommy persuaded me to keep the dog .
i eventually agreed , as long as he took it to a vet .
i couldn' t stand that squeaking anymore .
the vet found halfan undigested shoe , a squeaky toy ... ... and an 84 carat diamond lodged in its stomach .
it' s quite amazing what can happen in a week .
still didn' t shut it up , though .
so , what do you do ?
you go see the man that knows about these sort of things .
so , what do you think ?
do you know anyone who' d be interested ?
i might .
