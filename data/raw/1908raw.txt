i used to imagine that i' d been given to the wrong family at birth and that somewhere in the world my real people longed for me .
from where my father stood my failure to dog paddle was only the first of many failures .
failure to speak clearly .
failure to sit up straight .
failure to make friends every time we moved to another dreary upstate town .
in me , my father recognized a failed life his own .
when i got admitted to the junior college my father figured it was a clerical error .
when i dropped out a year later he wasn' t surprised .
quoyle !
quoyle !

i mean , yes .

the cop said he' s got something to tell me about petal .
i hope she didn' t get in any trouble .
she' s got such a temper on her .
there' s just no telling what she ...
the convertible went over a guardrail in jersey .
fortunately , your daughter was no longer traveling with mrs. quoyle and , uh , and her male companion .
she was mercifully killed on impact
i can promise you .
look , uh , there is something else .
seems she sold your daughter to a black market adoption outfit for $6, 000 .
there was even a receipt , if you can imagine .
that' s how we tracked her .
daddy !
daddy !
hi , sweetheart .
who' s that ?
that' s your great aunt agnis .
where' s petal ?
mommy !
mommy ?
mommy ?
maybe i could stay just a day or two .
your loved one has not left your heart
or your thoughts but is sleeping peacefully .
she' s sleeping ?
yes .
peacefully .
in heaven .
with the angels .
if i was asleep , i' d wake up .
why are you so scared , daddy ?
what do i do ?
it takes a year , nephew a full turn ofthe calendar , to get over losing someone .
that' s a true sayin ' .
the move' il help .
you' il see .
what place on earth could be better than ... the place your people came from ?
smell that clean northern sea ?
i' m not a water person .
at least the girl is .
i hope we' re doing the right thing , aunt .
i thought i' d never come back here .
but the older you get there' s an ache , a pull ... something you' ve got to figure out .
like you' re a piece in a puzzle .
it takes some time to get used to the rock ' neath you .
it' s a place like no other .
the people who came here came by accident .
those that stayed learned strange things can happen omens and restless spirits ... magic .
we quoyles , we left it 50 year ago .
hard times .
we' re nearly there .
quoyle point .
named after us .
you .
well , i don' t understand .
it' s may , there' s so much snow .
up here , forget everything you thought you knew about the weather .
i was born in that house .
empty 44 years
look at that roofline .
straight as a ruler .
look .
i wonder who that is .
it' s your grandfather , sian quoyle .
died before i was born .
died young 12 year old .
twelve ?
then he couldn' t have been my grandfather .
you don' t know newfoundlanders .
who' s this ?
it' s my father and ... and you .
i never did care for that hat .
oh !
my lord , the table !
the blessed table !
there' s no way we can live here .
it' s all fixable .
we' il get a carpenter .
oh , well , it might be cheaper if we just build a whole new house on the riviera .
only i wasn' t born on the riviera .
daddy ?
what ?
why did you wake me up ?
i wanted to see if you were asleep .
are these cables so the house won' t blow away ?
so far so good .
they say it rocked in storms like a big rocking chair .
made the women sick , so they lashed it down .
they' re moaning .
the house is sad .
what ?
you should let it loose .
i' m here to apply for a job .
come on in .
listen here ...
listen here , my son .
i' m going to need clarification on this .
i got doris koontz down as runner up in " cakes and muffins " but her entry is listed as " strawberry rhubarb cobbler " which i believe ought to be under " pies .
name' s tert card managing editor , rewrite man , and snow shoveller .
you' il have to do without the boss .
himself , jack buggit , has called in sick , as per usual .
which is why i am occupying his office , billy pretty and no bones about it .
come in .
name ?
uh , quoyle .
i just got here yesterday from new york ...
ah , you' re a quoyle , are you ?
well , i should' ve seen that right off .
sit down .
prior experience as a journalist ?
washington post ?
london times ?
oh , oh , no , i' m not a journalist .
i' m an ink setter .
i had that position ...
gammy bird .
are you in my office , tert ?
no , no , no , jack .
i' m just conducting a job interview here at my desk .
job interview ?
yeah , there' s a mr. quoyle here .
says he' s an ink setter .
the fella' s a quoyle , you say ?
and no mistake .
hmm .
have him meet me at the dock in , uh one hour .
that bronchitis of yours cleared up already ?
much better .
thanks for your concern .
okay , jack .
quoyle !
over here .
step lively .
uh ... hello there , mr. buggit .
the man at the ...
the name' s jack .
come on , get in .
i' m not a water person .
all quoyles is water people .
boats is in your blood .
that' s why i' m hiring you .
i need somebody to cover the shipping news .
you' il get a list from the harbormaster what ships go in to killick claw ...
but , mr. buggit , i i i' m an ink setter .
pay attention , me old son .
i don' t need no ink setter , i need a reporter .
and you' il do local car wrecks .
take the picture , write the story .
we run a front page photo of a car wreck every week whether or not we actually have a car wreck .
now , there' s a knack for taking photos that make you feel something .
if there' s a dark patch on the ground it reads blood whether it' s motor oil or diet coke .
and you want something human , uh a child' s mitten , a purse a baseball cap lying in the road .
see , that' s what makes it human .
that' s what makes the reader feel .
jack , i' m , i' m no reporter .
jesus sweet christ .
you think any of them tomcods knew how to write when i hired them ?
i get a feeling about people that' s all .
welcome home , guy .
i can' t do it .
i mean , even if i knew the first thing about writing , which i don' t , i ...
car crashes i can' t cover those .
why not ?
you know why not .
we face up to the things we' re afraid of because we can' t go around them .
car wrecks are a fact of life up here .
come winter , a drive into town' il be damn near impossible .
we' il buy us a boat .
look , i already told you , i' m not a water person .
they dragged it here .
what , honey ?
the house .
they dragged it here .
you must' ve had a dream , sweetheart .
who told you about that ?
a long time ago , on gaze island the old quoyles couldn' t make a go of it there so they lashed the house with ropes and they dragged it .
yeah , they dragged it .
across the ice , clear to the mainland .
right here .
this is from the " news of your neighbors " column .
the pole on the corner of main and west streets
has a sign on it that says
it' s illegal to place anything on that pole .
we see the postman has landed in the clink
for throwing the mail in killick claw harbor .
he said he had too much to deliver
and the folks could just take a dip and help themselves .
guess it helps if you can swim .
this is professional stuff .
how am i supposed to write this ?
you can' t .
you' il get it wrong .
here now , miss !
don' t you talk to your father like that !
course he can do it .
petal says dad never gets anything right .
yeah , well , it' il work out .
hello .
you must be quoyle .
b. beaufield nutbeem .
i head up the foreign news department .
steals every story off that goddamn shortwave .
which tert takes the liberty of rewriting in his own mystical tongue .
only to save you from charges of plagiarism , nutbeem .
ah , mr. billy pretty an old fish dog and local landmark .
edits the home news page poems , baby photos , household tips .
there' s your desk , quoyle .
is there , um , a computer ?
well , do you see one ?
no , i just ...
i see everyone else ...
keen powers of observation .
i can see why jack snatched you off the job market .
gammy bird .
uh huh .
right on to it .
well , quoyle , you lead a charmed life .
two minutes on the job and you got your first car wreck .
as far as i can tell , the site is really fresh about 10 , 15 minutes , uh , at the most .
you got two victims one male , one female .
not one vital sign between them so we' re gonna wait till the police come now .
uh , the rate of speed we estimate at 65 so there' s nothing unlawful here .
there' s not a whole lot you can do , right when a moose decides to get in your way .
that' s for sure .
uh ... the driver most likely had his chest crushed before the car hit the water , so at least that' s a mercy .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
well , there' s that , and the and the moose you know , which is a gift really when you think about it out of season
like that a moose that size .
oh , lord , yes .
billy , i suppose we could split it four ways , right ?
how much could you fit in the station wagon there ?
i' il take the hind quarter .
i know we' re gonna want to use some of those recipes from the " home page , " you know ?
yeah , yeah , yeah .
he' s new , is he ?
new fella .
there you go .
it' s wrecks like that that sells papers .
oh , jack knows his readers .
now , mind you , there' s more people down under these waters than are killed on the roads .
you' il want to get yourself a nice little boat before long .
something that fits the water .
i just don' t want to think about a boat right ...
wh who' s that ?
why ?
oh , i ...
i was just curious .
i' ve seen her around .
she' s very tall .
i ...
i mean she ... she' s got good posture .
she seems very ... her stride is different .
it was grief that caused her boy to be not right .
she was carrying him when her husband was drowned at sea .
like i was saying , there' s more life
lost that way .
how' s your car wreck coming , quoyle ?
if i wanted war and peace
i would have hired william bloody shakespeare .
the policeman ate breakfast at the codcake diner before he arrived at the accident scene " ?
yes ?
your spelling is fine and i' ve seen plenty worse grammar .
but but finding the center of your story the beating heart of it that' s what makes a reporter .
now , you' il have to start by making up some headlines .
you know ?
short , punchy , dramatic headlines .
now , have a look .
what do you see ?
tell me the headline .
horizon fills with dark clouds .
imminent storm threatens village .
but what if no storm comes ?
village spared from deadly storm .
how was your first day ?
what' s all this ?
nephew , we can' t fix up the house proper on a journalist' s wages , so i' ve un retired .
from what ?
boat upholstery .
all us quoyles have a feeling for boats .
who who' s this ?
that' s dennis buggit , master carpenter .
ah , only till i gets me lobster license .
i' m a fisherman in me soul .
buggit , huh ?
you you wouldn' t be related to my boss down at the gammy bird ?
mm hmm .
yeah , yeah .
my dad .
tomorrow i' il run two by fours under your second story .
oh , and , uh , i was you
i wouldn' t sleep in your upstairs tonight unless you want to wake up downstairs with a thud .
yeah .
yes , boy .
what ?
what ?
what is it ?
what is it ?
a ghost .
the window .
a skinny ghost , and a white dog .
i i didn' t dream it .
don' t say i did .
i won' t , i won' t , sweetheart , okay .
there' s a ghost there ...
okay , okay , shh , okay .
okay , shh ...
okay ...
okay .
shh .
oh , excuse me ?
this is our first day at school .
i don' t like these kids .
bunny .
um , she' s in the after school  they' re boring !
boring , boring , boring !
bunny , that' s enough .
i' m sorry .
she' s she' s not usually like this .
not usually like what ?
i hate going to new places where i don' t know anybody .
i don' t know anybody .
what' s wrong with him ?
bunny , that is ...
there is nothing wrong with him , all right ?
this is herry .
when he was being born he didn' t get enough air to breathe and that makes him a little slower than most people .
what' s your name ?
bunny .
a bunny rabbit .
that' s what my mother calls me .
is mommy at work now ?
no , she' s asleep with the angels .
i am a bunny rabbit .
oh , you certainly are .
boing , boing , boing , boing ...
whi which of those women are in charge here ?
neither of them .
they' re just moms .
oh , ' cause somebody really ought to be paying more attention to them .
i mean , look at that .
there' s scissors on the ground .
i mean , somebody really ought to be supervising them , don' t you think ?
yeah .
better get back to work .
supervising and all .
i' m wavey prowse .
i run the place .
they are having entirely too much fun aren' t they ?
it' s a constant problem around here .
bumbling dad
humiliated at day care .
quoyle !
c' mon over , quoyle !
order' s up now .
come and get it .
aye , sir .
hey .
hmm .
you' ve been to the harbormaster' s .
yeah , boats in , boats out .
not exactly the stuff of legends .
sometimes there' s a story behind the story .
what can i do you for then ?
oh , um , i' il have , uh , what whatever they' re having .
what are you having ?
squid burger .
it' s good .
all right , then .
you want some fries with that ?
okay .
all right , then , be back .
have you got yourself a boat yet , quoyle ?
no .
you ought to get alvin yark to build you one .
or you could buy nutbeem' s .
i built a chinese junk .
sailed it up from brazil .
unfortunately , i missed manhattan by a mile or two and got stranded here when i shipwrecked by gaze island .
i' ve almost finished my repairs .
i' il be sailing away soon .
she' s ugly , and ... the only thing i' ve ever loved .
eh , your story tugs at me bladder .
excuse me .
um , what is it between those two ?
first thing : you' il have to understand about the curse .
jack buggit' s father , his grandfather his great grandfather all died at sea .
jack is ... sensitive .
especially about the sea .
sensitive .
it' s what they call people around here who , um , " know " things .
so , dennis is forbidden the sea .
but being free
newfie and 21 , he goes , anyway .
what ?
and that' s enough ... ?
death storm .
a massive wave cracks her steel hull amidships a one inch crack from starboard to port .
men go in the water .
dennis is lost .
after about a week they come to jack and tell him the search is to be called off .
jack stands like a stone .
then he turns quick , the way he does and says ...
he' s alive ... and i know where .
so , off he goes , out to sea on his own , in just a skiff and finds dennis .
can you imagine the odds ?
finds him .
finds him .
both arms broken , 99 % dead .
the boy comes to .
and jack says to him , " if you ever step foot in a boat again , i' il drown you myself .
and do you know what dennis said ?
say it fast .
he said ...
all fishing licenses are spoken for .
i' d appreciate it if you gave me yours .
jack looked in his eyes and they never spoke again .
quoyle ... you got the " shipping news " written up yet ?
oh , yes .
there' s nothing here .
boats in , boats out .
what else is there ?
if i knew , i' d write it myself .
i took a chance on you , quoyle .
don' t let me down .
go get the aspirin now !
oh , shut up !
i had as much to drink last night as you did !
excuse me .
do i know you ?
i' m a ...
i i work for the local paper .
i do the the " shipping news .
i was just ...
is this your boat ?
that' s a boat .
this is a botterjacht .
she was built for hitler .
he was the original owner .
really ?
i i just wanted to ask you a a couple of questions .
the finest botterjacht ever built in holland .
tell him what happened in hurricane bob .
and she' s incredibly heavy .
40 tons of solid oak .
tell him !
she broke free of her moorings and pounded six boats expensive ones to rubble .
wham !
now tell him who let our insurance lapse .
wham !
oh , it took six very expensive lawyers to weasel us out of it .
jesus !
an inch from bankruptcy .
moral of the story ?
when you marry a tour guide confine his authority to mixing the drinks .
did i come at a bad time ?
yeah .
ten years ago would' ve been better .
wife fires artillery on hitler' s boat .
hello .
hi .
hi .
you guys need a ride ?
thanks , but , uh , herry likes to walk .
oh .
well , it' s a nice day for a walk .
mr. quoyle ...
about the other day ?
i' m sorry we got off on the wrong foot .
no , that' s , that' s all right .
i i was way off base .
i i admire anybody that works with kids .
that' s the hardest job in the world , you know ?
i' m i' m a journalist , myself .
really ?
have you seen our local paper ?
strictly fish wrap .
what ?
i' m the new reporter there .
oy ... uh ... oh ... no , i' m i' m sure ... that' il be , uh ...

let me know when you' re serious .
i' il take you down to see
alvin yark .
he' il make you up a sweet little rodney .
you don' t have the sense god gave a doughnut , do you ?
i' m going home .
the best you can do is bury it some dark night .
what in hell a name' s this ?
hitler' s barge .
uh , that' s , uh , a vessel in port .
it goes with the " shipping news .
so , what about the motorcycle accident ?
oh , i' m still working on that but i think this is a better story .
what do you mean ?
you didn' t do the one that jack wanted you to do ?
you did one that he don' t know you did ?
well , this is worse than your boat .
jack even sniffs this he' il cut you up for lobster bait .
i think i' il run it .
... and he crawled off the grass onto a branch and he made a cocoon , which is like a house except it' s for a caterpillar ...
hey , bunny .

he thinks i know how .
oh , oh ... no , no ...
go on , get the pig .

i i i don' t know what to say .
did i not tell you ?
my name is jack .
jack .
ibm , please .
get back to your work , quoyle .
i ...
b ...
m.
lumbering idiot stuns crowd ... for a change .
herry prowse !
look how well your kite is doing .
are you making it dance with your thoughts ?
your kite is doing so much better than mr. quoyle' s .
do you think bunny' s strange
i mean , mentally ?
the skinny ghost with the white dog ?
she told you about that ?
maybe she' s sensitive .
the way some folks are around here .
and what about the necklaces ?
do you know how many of those she makes ?
i mean ... and i found her bashing her baby doll' s brains out with a hammer .
a baby doll doesn' t have brains .
it' s a toy .
do you know she' s ... saving a room for her mother ?
did she tell you that ?
yeah .
is she strange , that' s all ?
is she okay ?
if if you had to take a guess .
that little girl' s the only friend my son ever had .
so she' s strange , you bet .
it crashed !
all right .
there you go .
do you know how he died ?
my husband ?
it was a calm night when herold took the boat out .
there was no sign of any storm .
storms can be sudden around here .
he wasn' t the only one whose boat went down .
it was four years ago ... and it' s yesterday .
look how high we' re up .
uh huh .
beat you to the car .
did i blow it or can you still be my friend ?
your friend ?
sure .
is this yours ?
the ghost brought it .
then he ran away .
the skinny ghost with the white dog ?
don' t say i dreamt it .
ah , you' re getting the hang of it .
now , coax her a wee bit to starboard .
attaboy .
you' re a quoyle there' s seawater in your veins .
how are things with your girl ?
oh , bunny' s just still adjusting , i think .
oh , i was talking about wavey prowse .
sorry ... sorry !
whoa !
jesus !
sorry .
i ...
wavey and i are just friends .
fine .
don' t have to drown me over it .
this is where i grew up .
that' s my poor old father there .
and that' s where your house stood .
before they dragged it across the ice .
yes , sir .
before they was driven away .
driven away by what ?
you never knew ?
ah , well .
it' s neither here nor there , right ?
the point is , they made a new place for theirselves .
no , by what ?
driven away by what ?
oh , that' s old stuff , boy .
it' s in my blood .
you ought to be able to tell me .
well , they come to gaze island centuries ago , they did .
the old quoyles was rackers .
they were , they were pirates , sort of like .
you see them cairns ?
fires used to burn in them to guide the ships at sea , like lighthouses .
now , the quoyles would move the fires to fool the ships .
they' d lure them into the rocks so the quoyles could grab their loot .
oh , they was a savage lot , the old quoyles .
then they went too far one day , they ... nailed a man to a tree and they cut off his nose to draw the nippers and the flies that that ate him alive .
and that' s when the quoyles was given their walking papers .
jesus .
now , there' s still an old quoyle down in one of these coves somewhere .
they say he slept with his wife after she was dead .
anything else i should know ?
that about covers it .
when the knitting pins , you is abreast
hold the tiller to the west ...
behind the pins you must steer ... [ m ]
till the old man' s shoe ... does appear .
pull , pull !
show me that necklace .
see , if you make the loops bigger you don' t have to make so many .
okay .
good morning .
can i talk to you for a minute ?
where' s that chair from ?
excuse me ?
the chair that you' re sitting in .
where' s it from ; where' d you get it ?
it' s not from around here , right ?
it' s foreign , it' s exotic .
i don' t want pirate' s loot in this home .
billy pretty told me all about it .
it' s a good thing somebody finally did .
i don' t believe in dwelling in the past .
no ?
then what are we doing here ?
making a future .
well , well , well if it ain' t the second coming of the quoyles .
taking a long and hearty meal break
i can' t help but noticing .
hope you' ve got a good idea for your next story , quoyle .
i' d hate for jack to think that it was just beginner' s luck .
let the man digest , tert .
mind you , if i was the esteemed author of the " shipping news " column
i' d pick up the mcgonigle oil field story .
petro dollars ; a golden flood of jobs .
you write a story about that
i' il put it right there on the front page .
thank you for stopping by , tert .
yeah , thanks , tert .
aw , gee ...
what was that all about ?
oh , uh , he owns mobil oil .
ten shares .
what about your column ?
what about it ?
you said you' d read it to me .
yeah , i will , once the game is done .
there' s a 1904 photo hung in the killick claw library ...
eight schooners heading out to the fishing grounds
their sails are white and beautiful .
but nowadays you' re just as likely to see
a big black shape of an oil tanker
like the ruptured golden goose .
last week it leaked 14, 000 tons of crude
onto the seabirds , fish and boats at cape despot .
there will be more and more tankers .
they will get old and corroded and their tanks will split .
and there will be less fish , and less fishermen .
nobody hangs a picture of an oil tanker on their wall , do they ?
what do you think ?
i think when tert card sees it , he' il stay up nights thinking of cheap shots to pay you back .
i think he won' t stop until you' re fired .
i think i haven' t been so proud of a friend ... since i don' t know when .
uh , what do you think ?
pretty impressive , huh ?
like i said , nobody hangs one of those .
well ... your column' s front page stuff .
only now it' s more a caption , is all .
more than 3, 000 tankers proudly ride ... the world' s seas .
even the biggest take advantage of newfoundland' s deep water ports and refineries .
spelled it all perfect so as not to embarrass you .
oil and newfoundland go together
like ham and eggs and like ham and eggs , they' il nourish us in the coming years .
even put your name on it .
let' s all hang a picture of an oil tanker on our wall .
man of your principles ...
i understand the only honorable course is resignation .
and if you' re off to see jack buggit you' re going to have to swim .
for i runs the gammy bird , every inch of it which he' d have to do without me .
and if you think he' s going to choose you over fishing then you' re dumber than a doughnut .
if that' s possible .
jack ?
for christ sakes , quoyle cut your motor !
all right , what' s the emergency ?
can' t it wait till i' m done fishing ?
it' s about my column .
card , he printed it not the way i wrote it .
well , so ?
you disapprove how card runs my newspaper enough to lose your job ?
yes or no ?
yes .
so , this is what jack and i think : we want to run quoyle' s wrong headed oil spills story because controversy sells papers and papers sells ads .
but the oil tanker picture stays .
you should have seen tert' s face .
yeah ?
oh , it was a beautiful thing .
that' s all right , i' ve seen it .
oh , it' s great .
mm hmm .
let' s see what the special is .
how do you feel about ordering to go ?
you ever had that before ?
no , what is it ?
seal flipper pie .
yeah , it' s made from , like the knuckle part of the flipper .
the slimy cartilage part .
yeah , it' s good , though .
i mean , it' s a good choice if you like that sort of thing .
i ... you know , i' m really not all that hungry .
i just wanted , you know , to come and sit .
i had a big lunch today .
yeah .
they say you' re not a real newfoundlander till you' ve had a piece of seal flipper pie .
that' s what they say ?
yeah , that' s right .
mmm , good .
that' s surprising .
i never eat it , myself .
you never eat this ?
this is horrible .
here , i got you some real food look .
christ .
i knew somebody was out here .
oh , for christ' s sake .
he' s still burning off the fever .
any feeling yet ?
little tingles .
you' re lucky .
i' m fine .
i' il be ready to get right back in that water in another 20 , 30 years .
do you know how close you were to dying ?
i' il get my uncle , alvin yark , to build you a proper boat and learn how to use it , okay ?
okay .
good .
were the eyes open or closed ?
i don' t know .
just said it was an disembodied head .
what' d the police have to say about it ?
still working on it .
a little late to return the head to its owner , though .
hello , nephew .
mrs. silver melville was arrested early today
in lanai , hawaii , for the murder of her husband socialite and raconteur mr. bayonet melville .
' he pushed me once too often , ' mrs. melville confessed
' so i finally pushed back . " '
good for you , my dear .
well , he probably deserved it .
hey .
hey .
don' t get your hopes up .
you' re the first man who ever cooked for me .
you got a lot of leeway .
how are they ?
they' re both asleep in bunny' s bed .
should we trust them ?
i can do this .
you just don' t think ...
oh , no .
no , i know .
here ...
let me do that , all right ?
there you go .
can you feel that ...
yeah . through your bandage ?
what ?
your husband , he never ... he never cooked you a meal ?
why are we talking about my husband ?
because i understand .
you said " it' s four years ago and it' s yesterday .
i understand that .
my husband' s not who we' re talking about , right ?
i' il go get herry .
he wouldn' t like waking up in a strange bed .
hey !
huh ? !
who are you ?
i tied magic in these knots to protect you from the house .
no good ever come from the old place .
never , never ... never .
you ... you have no ... business in the quoyle house .
i get you out of there .
but i am a quoyle .
a quoyle ? !
i was a quoyle before you was anything .
leave the house .
tell , uh ...
agnis hello from ...
cousin nolan .
you know why agnis come back ?
to show she ain' t afraid of the place no more .
' cause i know what she' s done .
i know .
she got rid of the baby she was carrying .
what could she do ?
what ?
she was only 12 and it was her own brother that done it to her .
no ...
no !
no !
no !
please !
no !
no !
please !
does that belong to you ?
sorry .
there' s still hot water in the kettle if you want some tea .
i' ve started looking for a place for me and bunny .
you sure you' re going to be okay at your shop ?
i said i would , didn' t i ?
i think silver melville was right to chop her husband' s head off .
he probably deserved it .
i think more women should do what she did .
maybe some should have done it to their own brother ...
my father .
cousin nolan dropped by last night .
i always thought if anyone knew , i' d be turned to stone .
shit !
here .
tea' s a good drink .
it' il keep you going .
when someone hurts you that much ... how do you ... ?
does it ever go away ?
is it possible ?
her name was irene .
the love of my life .
you look happy .
so , yeah , it is possible .
agnis tells me we got to move for the winter .
it' il be a three hour drive from here to the point .
all the ice ...
me and bunny , we' re going to have to find a room in town somewhere .
i' il have the usual , please , annie .
thank you .
well , if it' s a place to stay you need you can have my trailer .
timing' s perfect .
what are you talking about ?
my boat' s ready .
if i stay here any longer
i might begin to like the place .
i' m throwing myself a farewell party on saturday .
departure to follow sunday .
the rootless traitor .
regrets soon after , no doubt .
quoyle of the north !
quoyle of the north .
have you and wavey done the dirty yet ?
shh !
she' s the grieving widow .
grieving for herold prowse .
oh , that' s a good one .
let me tell you something about old herold prowse .
it' s like a party game in town to look at babies and see if they look like herold .
hey ...
hey !
everyone !
to nutbeem !
to nutbeem !
we all loves our fucking nutbeem , huh ? !
lets us keep him here then !
got your chainsaw , neddie ?
nutbeem !
hoh oh oh !
what' s wrong ?
i' m a quoyle .
i' m one of the quoyles pirates and looters and murderers .
my father raped his little sister and then he taught me how to swim .
stop that .
jesus , you smell like a brewery .
stop it .
go on , herry .
go on .
stop it !
herry .
sorry , herry .
i' m sorry , petal .
i' m so sorry .
i meant wavey .
good .
i feel much better .
when were you going to tell me about your fucked up marriage ?
i' m scrambling eggs .
are you going to be able to eat ?
no .
listen , i' m ...
maybe i should just go .
you forget where the door is ?
he ran off to winnipeg with some little bitch .
she was barely out of high school .
is that fucked up enough for you ?
herold ... my husband , he didn' t die .
not that he didn' t deserve to .
he left me when i was eight months pregnant ; no good to him in bed .
so i took his 15 footer out into the bay cracked the hull with a hatchet and sunk her and pretended he was drowned and played the grieving widow and packed my bags to leave town .
but then a funny thing happened .
all these folk i grew up with they put their hearts around me and herry so we wouldn' t be alone .
and i just couldn' t leave .
i' m sorry , wavey .
you' re always sorry .
you' re looking dishy , quoyle .
i' m afraid my offer to let you stay in my trailer will have to be retracted .
sorry about that .
and your boat .
i' m some disgusted with the human race .
i never would have made it anyway .
storms would have blown me to bits .
you boys saved my life , i imagine .
i' ve gathered up my savings , and i' m flying back to brazil where the water is swimming pool green .
you and bunny can stay with the wife and me .
to brazil .
brazil .
brazil .
brazil .
we can stay with aunt agnis over at her shop .
barely enough room there for myself .

would you write something for the gammy bird about jack ?
yes , i' il try .
jack is ...
jack is all right now .
you all know ... we are only passing by .
we walk over these stones a few times .
our boats ... sail for a little while on the waves and then they have to sink .
jack knew that better than anyone .

yes , boy .
he' s awake !
jack ...

oh , jack ... oh , jack ...

the fishing license is yours .
sweetheart , you ready ?
i want to have a wake for petal .
why didn' t we have a wake ?
why didn' t we wake her up ?
it worked for him .
honey , mr. buggit wasn' t really ...
it' s more like he was in a coma .
from the cold water .
it' s like he was sleeping .
petal was asleep .
no , honey ...
you said she was asleep with the angels .
i know .
honey , i know what i said , honey .
you said !
you said !
i know , but she' s not sleeping .
you said !
you said !
honey , honey , listen to me .
you said !
i know what i said .
listen to me .
listen to me .
i just ...
i was too scared to tell you the truth .
petal is dead .
and you know that .
i know you know it .
it' s okay .
is it because of me ?
what ?
that she drove away .
well , why would you say that ?
because ... because i' m boring .
oh ...
no , honey , it' s not because of you .
and you are anything but boring .
come here .
you just come here .
hon ...
you believe me , don' t you ?
you still don' t believe me , do you ?
about the house .
i told you so .
it' s all right .
worse things have happened .
to both of us .
maybe one day we' il build a summerhouse out here .
summer ...
do they have summer here ?
oh , you' il know it' s summer when the partridge berries are out .
and we can make partridge berry duff and sweet berry okie .
will you show me how ?
i will , yeah .
i will .
there are still so many things i don' t know .
if a piece ofknotted string can unleash the wind and if a drowned man can awaken ... then i believe a broken man can heal .
deadly storm takes house .
leaves ...
excellent view .
