so , if you got somebody on the side , you need to tell me .
baby , listen to what you just say .
mapquest said it takes six minutes to get here .

if i was cheating on you , dont you think id need more than two minutes ?
you know what ?
i aint going to deal with this .
im tired , okay ?
i had a long day at work .
i got shot at .
see , that is exactly what lm talking about .
we dont communicate .

lets start with last week .
last week .
you and i were supposed to go shopping together .
we get to the mall .
i buy this beautiful dress , i get my hair done .
you dont say anything .
i dont know , maybe you just dont want to ...
did you hear me just now ?
tell me what i said .
i heard everything .
you was communicating .
dont play with me right now .
i am not in the mood .
i cannot believe you came home late and then you start ...
marcus !
you are falling asleep again .
i am talking to you .
i wasnt asleep , i was closing my eyes and visualizing your words .
oh , really ?
visualizing ?
why dont you paint me a picture of what i just said ?
hold on .
you know why ?
because you are falling asleep again .
marcus !
we received this from mr. andrew wilson , ceo of wilson cruise lines .
it was delivered to his home .
the girls in the photo are his daughters ... and heiresses to the wilson fortune .
we believe they are the kidnappers next victims .
mr. wilson has given us permission to shadow his daughters .
were going to set up surveillance ... and if the kidnapper strikes ... this time we will be ready .
now , the wilson sisters will be flying into jfk this morning .
so whos going to pick them up ?
obviously , everyone has read the profile on the girls .
still , somebodys got to do it .
i dont think this is a good idea .
i dont care .
we deserve to be on this case just as much as gomez and harper .
i know , but we dont want to interrupt the man in a briefing .
well , somebody got to stand up to him .
chief .
what ?
marcus has something he want to tell you .
what ?
chief , we just want to know if we could get on the case .
youre on .
the boys over at intel seem to think that the kidnappers a guy ... named ted burton .
it says burton was a partner of wilsons ... and some other associates in some business venture that failed .
says he spent time in the federal pen and lost his fortune .
guys been mla since his release and those dates coincide with the first kidnappings .
what do you think ?
i think this babysitting gig sucks .
dude , relax .
look , man .
all we got to do is pick these chicks up ... drop their ass off in the hamptons , then we back in the chiefs good graces .
i didnt join the fbi to become a nanny .
i want to be on the street where the action is .

look , i spent all night talking about myself .
sometimes its good for a man to just sit back and listen .
well , since you put it that way .
i did this piece on warren vandergeld .
him and his partners tried to swindle a guy .
you talking about ted burton ?
yeah , how did you know that ?
it was in the paper .
i read about it .
but what they didnt report in the paper ... was that burton was 10 times smarter than all of them .
he embezzled millions and stashed it in an offshore account .
when vandergeld heard the story was going to break ... he didnt want to be embarrassed .
well , there goes my job .
you know , youre a good listener .
it seems like you have the whole package .
man !
hello ?
kev , you got to go .
