a long , long time ago , nosferatu , the undead , the race of the vampire , were driven from egypt .
most fled to the mountains of transylvania but others of better taste , including myself , travelled south through africa and over the atlantic to a beautiful island in the bermuda triangle .
there we lived for happy centuries feasting on the blood of travellers , until discovered by the hunters once again .
then , the blood that spilled was our own .
i alone escaped but a vampire alone is a vampire doomed .
my only chance was to find the one known offspring of our tribe that had been born in a foreign land a woman somewhere in this place called brooklyn .

nobody' s gonna miss you .

i wouldn' t do that .
you might miss the heart .
you aim between the eyes , that way you get a nice , even spray .
what the hell ?
who the fuck are you ?
i' m maximillian , a connoisseur of death , you might say .
no one takes pride in the art , it' s so rare you come across a clean kill nowadays .
you got two seconds to beat it or you' re gonna share a coffin with carl lewis .
i already have a coffin of my own .
come on .
he' s no fun .
he fell right over .
some fuckin ' wackos in this town .
let' s get back to you , julius .
i guess you' re out of bullets , huh , man ?
no , i kept one special just for you .
lnteresting .
i' ve been stabbed and i' ve been hanged and i' ve been burned , even broken on the rack once , but i' ve never been shot before .
it kind of itches a little .
you have quite decent aim , though .
but next time ...
put a little heart into it .
oh , shit !
don' t go away .
he' s gonna get it with the gun !
no , don' t !
holy shit !
he ain' t gonna get me !
i' ve seen it all .
i' m getting my ass the hell out of brooklyn .
i' m going to the islands , somewhere peaceful .
coney lsland .
ryker' s lsland .
devil' s lsland .
let me light that for you .
oh , shit !
hey , yo , i don' t know how you know me but ... everything is everything , i ain' t seen nothing .
so you jump back through the window cos i ain' t really seen you , i' m blind !
i got cataracts , i mean contacts .
i got astigmatism , man .
i' m blind .
where you at ?
see ?
where you at ?
i saw you at the docks .
you' re a liar , a thief and a cheat .
no , that' s my brother miles .
i' m honest .
well , that' s unfortunate because that' s what i liked about you .
hey , easy , bro .
you ain' t got to pull that blacula shit with me .
lf you' re hungry , i' il run you down the kfc and get you a two piece .
i already had ltalian .
you' re going to make me think you don' t like me .
wouldn' t want to do that , now , would we ?
i got nothing but love for you , baby .
hey , what the fuck are you doing ?
welcome to the party , julius .
oh , shit !
it hurts , doesn' t it ?
pain is an underrated experience but it happens to be my speciality and like it or not , you belong to me now .
h hey , bro , why you do that ?
it feels kinda ... kinda right .
because i need your eyes in the day and your services at night .
but first i need my coffin .
come !
wait !
where you going ?
what' s up ?
you ain' t gonna be sucking my neck ?
why ?
you' re my ghoul now .
i need you to help me find a woman .
a woman ?
you came to the right spot .
brooklyn' s full of hos .
i' m not interested in your hos .
i' m looking for a special woman , one of my kind , the only one like her in the world .
as i' ve come to her , she' il soon come to me like a moth to a flame .
so you' re checking for a vampster bitch ?
half vampire and she' s ignorant of it .
the other half sleepwalks in humanity but i can cure that if i find her before the next full moon .
here ?
yes , here .
somewhere in brooklyn .
this night shift is kicking my ass .
how come you never get tired ?
i' ve always been more of a night person myself .
this is a good one , listen up now .
your faith will be tested as a loved one dances with death .
beware the dark stranger
and when all' s lost , look to your soul for the answers .
i wouldn' t wanna be you this week .
this is your horoscope , not mine .
that' s my horoscope ?
oh , shit .
we have no information on the cause of death but all bodies so far seem drained of blood .
what the hell is this , captain ?
love boat came in a few hours ago .
there was 18 that we know of .
whole gang' s doa .
aw , jeez .
ship' s log ?
sort of half rotten and it' s in a strange language .
sent it to nyu to see if they could figure it out .
witnesses ?
night watchman , silas green .
let him tell you what he thinks he saw .
all right .
hey , rita .
hey .
how' s your new partner holding up ?
she' s cool , she just needs time .
she' s had three months already .
i know her mother just died in a nuthouse but she' s got a job to do .
she' s a good cop .
she' il surprise you .
that' s what i' m afraid of .
i got it .
kinda narrow here .
watch your step , lady .
excuse me .
my back is killing me .
how many more we got ?
15 of them left .
careful there .
give me your light .
you need a cast iron stomach .
so you say you saw a ... a what ?
it was a wolf , goddammit !
big , black ass wolf !
motherfucker jumped off the boat , ran over there and the son of a bitch turned into a man !
did the flip flop shit on me !
just like a whore i knew in detroit in ' 62 , ' 63 .
i' d go over her house saturday night ,
i come through the door , she' s a man !
flip floppin ' and shit !
you ever had a motherfucker flip flop on you , going crazy and shit ?
so the wolf you saw looked something like that ?

you people belong behind the line !
hey , b , where' s your coffin at ?
it' s on the boat .

shit , we can' t get it now , look at all these cops .
and you people , you people better keep back .
killer loves to bite .

there' s a coffin .
ln here , come on .
right in there .
look .
what ?
i don' t see anything .
l i could' ve sworn ...
rita , are you ok ?
i' m fine .
absolutely fine !
good , cos that' s exactly what i told captain dewey absolutely fine .
right .
you all right ?
let me out of here .
what is that ?
it' s an ear .
a rotted off human ear .
yeah , but my ear ?
look !
my fucking ear done fell off !
you' ve another on the other side .
besides , the benefits of being a ghoul outweigh the drawbacks .
what benefits ?
benefit my fucking ear back on !
you put me in the monster union ?
i' m on blue cross ?
i meant blue shield , brother .
i have taken refuge in some sorry places ...
this is a bargain .
my uncle silas is the landlord ...
what the hell is all this damn noise ?
julius , is that you ?
it' s me .
you little scared piece of shit .
i ought to whoop your ass for booking out on me .
you wouldn' t believe what i saw .
oh , i bet you i would .
nobody believes me .
i know a big ass wolf when i see one !
what the hell' s going on ? !
just ...
who' s that ?
that' s my boss .
you got a job ?
what do you mean ?
of course i got a job !
i got a good job , too .
he just need a place to lay low .
rent' s double .
no , what ?
triple .
you know you missing an ear ?
that' s just a trick i' m working on .
you can' t triple the rent .
you got ...
night started off like shit but ... end up pretty good .
i don' t turn nothing down but my collar .
howdy do .
welcome .
trash man comes on tuesdays .
god loves you , god loves me , bye .
good thing you ran into me .
i' il hook you up .
i' il make sure everything we do is gonna be right .
first , we in brooklyn now , man .
you gotta get rid of this thing .
you ever heard of a futon ?
lighter , comfortabler , better for your back , good to fuck on .
you gonna scratch your ass fucking on this .
a couple of things to know .
one , never sit on my coffin .
two , i want to find the girl tonight !
sounds good , yeah . ls there a three ?
i don' t like mirrors !
got it .
maybe i am going crazy .
what' s happening to me ?
justice , it' s not just the bodies or the ear , i got a feeling .
you got a feeling about everything and what do i say ?
everything by the book .
but if it ain' t in the book , going by the book won' t solve it .
all i' m saying is give something to intuition .
we' ve got a development in that boat people mess .
a couple of stiffs on bates street .
one guy was ripped to pieces .
what about the other guy ?
he' s in one piece
except he' s missing a heart .
two blocks from the docks .
very good .
what about the ship' s log ?
the university couldn' t make sense of it so they sent it to this dr ...
zeko .
apparently , some sort of specialist .
zeko .
what' s the address ?
315 south rockaway .
that' s a tough neighbourhood .
what kind of doctor is he ?
i don' t know , maybe he' s a heart specialist .
let' s check it out .
i didn' t finish my coffee .
take it with you .
go .
come on .
captain , here' s the latest figures on the boat .
zeko' s , huh ?
yeah , i got me the 41 1 .
i got the info and a happy meal .
good !
things were progressing well .
rita' s vision of herself dead in my coffin was a certain sign she was destined to be my mate .
even my ghoul was performing well those duties only a ghoul can do when the cursed sun drives a vampire to the shelter of his coffin .
ln return , he would enjoy all the perks of ghouldom , maybe someday make vampire himself , all with only minor side effects .
shit !
what ...
what are you ...
what are you doing sitting there ?
you got the dropsies , i think .
got no dropsies .
so , tell me , uh ... tell me what you think of these wheels .
i say lucky it' s an automatic cos you don' t have enough hands to shift and drive at the same damn time .
a wedding ?
a funeral .
very nice touch .
i knew you' d like it .
i used to look like that in ' 62 .
same hair .
same clothes .
stop harassing the man .
lf i was you , i' d take a dick check quick .
it' s all there .
it' s all there .
thank god for small favours , and i do mean small .
see that ?
young punk .
max , why didn' t you bite this bitch when you had the chance ?
she has to give herself to me voluntarily .
hey , this is brooklyn , baby .
don' t nobody give up shit unless you got some cold cash or a hot slug .
ln this case , i know more about her than she knows about herself .
one dance with me , one dance , and she' il be mine .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
now you' re talking , player .
i bet you dance that hammer shit .
show me what you gonna do when you get in there .
show me that old hammer shit you gonna do .
that' s some good shit , man .
am i gonna be able to disappear in the mirror too ?
i' m warning you .
drive the limo and shut your fucking mouth .
shut up !
hey , man , not while i' m driving !
shut the fuck up !
shit !
i' m driving ...
goddammit ! .. and you give me a brain aneurysm ?
you put somebody eye out !
i had the lab do a check on that seaweed that was all over the boat .
seems that type only grows in an isolated area of the caribbean .
caribbean ?
my mother did her studies down there before she had me .
how come you don' t talk about your mother ?
the paper said she was incredible .
there' s nothing to talk about .
i never really knew her .
she flipped .
they stuck her in the institution , me in a foster home .
how' d your father handle it ?
he didn' t .
he was murdered down in the islands before i was born .
i wish i had known him , at least something about him but ...
wait a minute .
what ?
lf we' re right , that' s dr zeko' s .
that' s one funky doctor' s office .
so where is this guy ?
i don' t know .
closer than you think .
dr zeko , i' m ...
i know who you are and why you' re here .
you know where this ship came from ?
any one of 100 isles in the swells of the sargasso sea , in an area you call the bermuda triangle .
sit down .
the bermuda triangle ?
dr zeko , what does the log say ?
it spoke of a voyage filled with sickness and nightmares .
they believed an evil was aboard .
an evil ?
i thought they killed the last of them but these men warn us from beyond he is here .
he ?
nosferatu .
the undead .
the vampire .
look , nothing personal , my man , but this is a murder investigation , not a witch hunt .
now , that boat' s crew are sleeping at the morgue , they are not ... cruising the boulevard sucking necks .
the world is full of false notions , detective .
vampires are a race , not a club you join by being bitten .
yeah , yeah , a race , not a club .
of course
beware , detective .
this is more deadly than anything your job has shown you .
a vampire has no mercy , no regrets .
he can change shapes .
he could be sitting next to us now and we wouldn' t even know it .
yeah , well , i would know it .
rita , i' m gonna call in .
all right .
dr zeko , how do you know so much about this ?
on my island ...
i faced one over a woman .
i lost .
she was taken .
here' s my best advice and please listen carefully .
keep your faith , rita .
lf i know one thing , it' s this you' il need it .
do you have a problem , pal ?
there' s a killer on the loose .
you don' t say .
and what might you know about him ?
well , he' s very smart , very quick
and quite deadly .
do you know where this killer is ?
he' s right behind you .
it' s all right .
oh , i' m gonna die .
no , not quite yet .
they' re very much like us , you see ... misunderstood .
sorry .
this never happened before .
that' s unbelievable .
thank god you were here .
god had nothing to do with it .
i' m max .
rita .
rita veder .
i think ...
you know , i know this is gonna sound like a line but i really feel like i' ve seen you somewhere before .
do you believe in the supernatural ?
i might .
well , i had this dream ...
what kind of dream ?
there was a beautiful woman ... a woman with a smile so lovely it could brighten the darkest night .
but she was trapped .
she was trapped in a prison where the moon never shined .
she couldn' t escape because she didn' t know how .
and then i came and i set her free .
did you ?
the woman was you , rita .
i recognise you .
well ...
how did you set me free ?
i set you free with a dance .
let me show you .
come .
what am i thinking ?
i can' t .
i' m on duty .
on duty ?
sounds like a personal problem .
do you know who this is ?
this ain' t nick ashford , this is maximillian , all right ?
this mofo' s got a pussy surplus .
solid as a rock !
all right , fuck it , then .
he want to get it on with you , see ?
so just be nice and show my man some respect cos he' il put it on with you .
she' s straightened out , boss .
i' m sorry .
no .
who knew you were so popular ?
but it' s a good thing , cos i wouldn' t dance with you if you were the last man on earth .
you ready ?
yeah .
more than .
i' il see you again , rita .
ln your dreams , max .
she' s one of a kind .
she is .
not your kind , though .
fuck them .
i got these two ...
this tongue of yours has complicated a very simple plan .
lf it happens again , i' il hang you with it , understand ?
i' il have to take drastic measures , time is short .
hey , you the boss ...
gimme a break .
you saying some kind of evil spirit stowed away on board ?
what if i am , huh ?
you want cream ?
no .
dewey heard you , she' d have you in a straitjacket .
sometimes i feel things , all right ?
now , i didn' t ask for it , i don' t understand it but you can' t explain it all by the book .
you finally get a man back here and you' re gonna kick his ass .
lnteresting approach .
uh , justice , this is my roommate , nikki .
nikki , my partner , justice .
from the way y' all was arguing , i' d swear you was in love .
no .
good .
look , i' m gonna go on back to the crib , cos , um ...
it' s getting a little late and ...
wait a minute .
you don' t want the coffee ?
no , you can buy me some tomorrow .
i' ve had my fill of superstition .
next we' il be seeing little green men .
right .
sure , whatever , ok .
you can find your way out , right ?
you sure you don' t want coffee ?
no , i' m breaking out .
who painted this ?
that' s rita' s .
she paints things she sees in her nightmares .
rita' s got weird taste in art but good taste in men .
it' s real late .
gotta go .
bye .
freud would say that if you leave something this important behind , it means you really don' t want to go .
two words cold shower .
thank you .
now , he' s obviously a man of poor taste .
my sentiments exactly .
you sure ain' t from around here .
yes , you could say i' m a long way from home .
mine' s upstairs .
would you like to warm up with some coffee or ... some other refreshment ?
but i wouldn' t want to keep you up .
oh !
fuck me !
fuck me !
oh , baby .
say my name , baby .
keep it coming !
i feel ... l feel like ...
damn you , justice .
goddamn you .
i' m coming !
i' m coming !
i do not believe you .
let me see your face .
let me see your face !
this part of the seduction is quite simple , really .
just take away everything she has , then give her everything she needs .
rita .
girl , i finally found a man who can make the room spin .
moving out to find a place of my own , cos we' re gonna need the room to roam .
ciao baby , nikki .
right .
oh yeah , you , like , figure out what she' s into and then fuck her head up with it ?
ln a manner of speaking , yes .
but church .
she had to go to a church .
my pops said the quickest way to a woman' s heart is through the church !
it' s through the rib cage but that' s messy .
no , there are much more interesting ways to her heart .
through her fears , for instance , or through her faith .
excuse me .
just a second , son .
preacher ... pauley ?
and if you' ve been misbehavin ' , preacher pauley' s here for savin ' .
well ...
i think that i' m beyond saving .
going to church ?
i just wanna catch preacher first , is he still in the parking lot ?
preacher .
i' m preacher pauley .
yes , how are you tonight ?
rita veder , how are you tonight , girl ?
i' ve been tossing about this case i' m on .
tossin ' , right .
i' ve been having these ... really strange feelings .
i felt i needed to talk to someone that i could trust .
you come to the right place .
tossin ' and havin ' strange feelings .
and then i heard the voices .
you heard voices .
yes , like they were inside my head .
ln your head ?
really .
does this make sense ?
ls it possible ?
you' d be surprised what' s possible .
i' m just afraid of ending up like my mother , afraid i' m losing my mind .
afraid you' re going crazy , that' s good .
it' s good to get that out .
you fear you' re going crazy , tell people .
you need an outlet .
i get it out in my paintings .
you paint ?
yes .
it' s good to paint .
you know , when i was young , i used to paint ...
preacher pauley !
come on .
everybody' s waitin ' .
i don' t know if right now' s ...
go ahead .
the lord waits for no one .
get your butt in here .
right now is not a good time !
goddamn !
what did he say ?
god damns anybody who doesn' t glorify in his work !
it' s a hell of a night outside .
let' s do the sermon on the lawn .
come on , sister .
goddamn !
shit .
excuse me .
can we bring it down just a little , please ?
brothers and sisters , please quiet down .
thank you .
we come here time after time and we talk about the same old same old .
hey , quiet down .
we talk about jesus .
that' s right .
jesus said and jesus wept .
jesus heard and jesus walked over .
i don' t wanna talk about jesus .
cos as the big man teaches us , there' s two sides to every story .
not one but two .
a story is not one sided .
a story has duality .
there' s two sides to every story .
which brings to mind the phrase " necessary evil " .
i know many of you hear that phrase and say ,
that don' t even make no sense to me .
can' t be no such thing as necessary how' s evil necessary ?
that don' t match .
that' s plaids and stripes , evil and necessary .
you see , because without bad , there is no good .
without light , there is no dark , you need both these things .
you hear what i' m saying ?
lf every day is a sunny day , well , then , what' s a sunny day ?
well , the bottom line , what i' m trying to tell you tonight , is that evil ... eeeevil ... is necessary .
evil is necessary , thereby , if it' s necessary , evil ...
evil ...
.. must be good .
evil is good .
that' s what i think .
evil must be good , must be good .
let me hear y' all say it ...
evil is good .
evil is good .
take brother brown , one of our strongest deacons , pillar of stability .
brother brown was on bushwick avenue last night with a two dollar whore .
i didn' t know she was no whore !
you lyin ' dog ,
you said you was at your mother' s .
now , that' s evil .
when you tell your wife , " i' m going to see mama , " then you go get you a two dollar ho , that' s evil .
but brother brown had a good time with that two dollar ho .
you can push a two dollar ho and she don' t have no limits !
evil and good walk hand in hand .
evil is as evil does .
i thought i' d find you here .
what are you doing here ?
the captain has something for us , info on those stiffs in the dumpster .
what' s wrong ?
remember nikki .
you fucked her , didn' t you ?
we got us another one !
fucked who ?
you know damn well who .
nikki .
you know damn well !
what ?
nikki !
the whore of babylon .
that' s what she was .
the whore of babylon .
i never touched that girl .
then you should change your shirts more often .
her lipstick' s on your collar !
lipstick on his collar !
what kind of man are you ?
it' s a shame and a shock !
it didn' t happen like that .
tell her .
don' t be ashamed of yourself , boy .
don' t be ashamed cos you went out and got you a little ass !
ass is good !
that' s right !
i know many of y' all may be saying , " how can he say ass is good ?
how y' all think y' all got here ?
ass is good !
evil' s good and ass is good .
and if you get you a piece of evil ass ...
rita , where are you going ?
rita , you buggin ' .
this is ridiculous !
then forget it .
no .
i left after you went to bed !
you don' t have to explain .
no , she bumped into me .
i was at the station .
five guys' il swear it .
hey , she borrows everything else of mine ...
of yours ?
did you say yours ?
that came out wrong .
no , you said yours .
forget it .
you got your own rules , you play by your own game .

numbers runner for kitty caprisi .
julius ?

come on in .
i feel as if you know me .
we do have a lot in common , don' t we ?
some things , yes , but you' ve been to so many places , you' ve seen so much , you' ve had such an exciting life .
you might say that i' ve had several .
sometimes i wonder what' s out there , beyond the skyline , beyond brooklyn , past everything i' ve ever known .
there' s no place you can' t go .
no place the subway doesn' t run .
but what about your dreams , rita ?
your dreams of another life ?
and another world ?
another you ?
everyone has those dreams .
you' ve a hunger never satisfied and a need never fulfilled .
god only knows what i need .
and i know .
you need to give me this drink ... and give me your hand ...
and come dance with me .
oh , no .
i' m not a good dancer .
come , please .
just one dance .
come , come .
oh , max .
this is crazy .
there' s nothing wrong with being just a little crazy .
i' ve never danced like this before .
and now , you' il never stop .
i haven' t felt like this since ...
i' ve never felt like this .
how would you like to feel like this every night ?
ls that a trick question ?
to go to places you' ve never been ?
yes .
drink the wine you' ve never tasted ?
i can give it to you , rita .
a world where no one laughs at you for what you feel , what you see , what you are .
all you have to do is just ... say ...
say the word , say it .
looking for the girl ?
the girl ?
what girl ?
you' re a cop , you' re supposed to remember faces .
the night watchman down at the dock ?
right .
i' m also the proud landlord of this residential type place , so i do know who comes and i do know who goes .
i' m looking for a brother named julius .
julius jones .
jones , jones ...
i knew a latoya jones once .
called her mrs butterworth cos she had a ass flat like a pancake .
i haven' t seen her around lately but i have seen your partner , yes i have .
you seen my partner ?
musta done some serious bumpin ' last night with that cat .
what cat ?
some suave motherfucker .
new tenant .
he' s been tapping that top shelf booty !
i' m talking bang bang bang !
when she walked out this morning , she was bow legged .
so you know where she went ?
i' d say she went home to sleep .
course , she didn' t get none last night .
bang bang ... 1 3 fox , come in , over .
shit .
justice , where are you ?
1 3 fox , what' s up ?
a doa at brooklyn city hall .
female , late twenties , captain requests you on the site .
hey , connie .
hey .
god knows who or what got her up there .
let me see that thing .
looks like a bed sheet or something she' s wrapped up in .
shit !
damn .
nikki .
lf there' s one thing a vampire has , it is patience , especially with those of his own kind .
but even that , in time , runs out and then in the family of darkness , blood will prove thicker than water can ever be .
rita , wake up !
rita , wake up !
damn , girl !
i musta called here 50 times !
did you sleep all day ?
i' m thirsty .
what' s going on ?
what are you doing here ?
it' s about nikki .
whatever happened between you ...
she' s dead , rita .
what ?
but it' s more than that .
the way she was hanging was exactly the way you painted it .
no , it was just a dream .
no , it' s real .
everything that you believed in and i didn' t is real .
justice , you saw her ?
then somehow i' m not crazy .
no .
no crazier than the rest of us .
why me ?
why is this happening to me ?
i don' t know ... but we' il figure this out , together .
now , we make mistakes and we have differences but ...
that' s ok , we' re only human , right ?
you know what you' re doin ' ?
no .
i' il make it up as i go .
i want this but ...
damn !
oh , damn !
ldiot !
easy .
honey lamb , now ain' t a good time to fuck with the man ...
oh , shit , he got you too ?
i' il handle this .
i' il be in the kitchen .
want a cappuccino ?
welcome home .
do you still take red ?
after last night , you' il want something with a little more bite .
what have you done to me ?
only what you asked .
i didn' t ask for this !
no , but you wanted it .
you needed it and now you can feel it , look at you .
you feel more alive than you' ve ever been , stop fighting it .
death becomes you .
it was you , wasn' t it ?
all the murders , the alley , the boat , nikki .
it' s a gift but you have it too , i just unwrapped it for you .
gift ? !
of what , death ?
of life !
i have given you eternal life !
this isn' t happening .
it' s happening as we speak .
can you feel it ?
come here !
listen .
listen to me !
do you hear that ?
do you hear it ?
that is the sound of the night and it' s calling .
not to me .
not to me !
women .
frightening , isn' t it ?
yes , you are .
i meant freedom to do anything you want , any time , anywhere .
i know it' s terrifying at first .
i passed terrified about half an hour ago .
all your life you wondered why you felt things that no one else felt , why you never caught a cold , never broke a bone .
this is just a dream , right ?
soon i' m gonna wake up and ...
and i will be there .
i' m not going to be alone again .
i' d perish without you .
i gotta go back , go back to my life , you can' t stop me .
you can' t .
then go .
go back to your little shoe box apartment filled with those empty dreams .
go back to church and don' t forget the collection , the preacher' s whisky is running low .
go back to your job !
where they laugh and call you crazy !
or you face the truth that you have no place left to go but to me .
what do you know about truth ?
you lied to me from the beginning .
your father sent me to you .
what ?
that' s the truth .
your father .
lf i had told you that when i first met you , if i had told you what you were , would you believe me if i told you that you were the daughter of a vampire ?
you' re lying !
you' d have loved your father .
your mother did before they killed him .
who ?
who killed him ?
who ?
humans !
humans fear what they don' t understand and hate what they fear .
he sacrificed himself so your mother could live .
it drove her insane .
but what if i don' t want this ?
what if you do ?
what if you do ?
who' s there ?
step into the light .
detective justice .
you were expecting me ?
you or the dark one , could have gone either way .
personally , i' m glad it' s you .
i need your help .
things have changed .
sit down .
rita has changed .
she' s seeing things in her dreams .
now she' s missing .
what kind of dreams ?
nightmares .
she paints them .
a girl was murdered and it was exactly the way rita painted it .
and then ... then i saw this .
this is the last one she did .
then it' s true there was a child .
i knew rita' s mother .
i was in love with her years ago .
she studied the vampires of my island .
i was her guide .
i saw her succumb to the powers of the dark one and rita is the result .
it' s like , just clean my house , i don' t care if your kid' s sick ...
please don' t .
we must .
besides , she deserves it .
we must feed , rita , or we die .
well , here' s my shortcut .
bye bye .
this one is the last .
he needs her .
he has to move very , very quickly .
i' il kill him if he hurts her .
you have to .
to save her , you must kill him before she abandons her humanity and feeds .
much as she is human , she is now also a predator .
what' s a nice girl like you doing in a place like this ?
i have pepper spray and i' il use it !
but i want you to know i understand the negro people .
you' ve been chained by the oppression of white capitalist society .
yes , well ... then you' il understand this !
your turn , rita .
taste her .
taste her and quench the hunger .
i won' t do it !
you don' t have a choice !
no deposit , no return , no going back .
help me .
i' m not going forward !
you can' t run from your hunger !
there' s no place you can hide !
forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us .
and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil !
help me !
where are you taking me ?
you need rest .
we have a long journey ahead .
where we going , boss ?
home !
while she rests , you pack .
we try to leave by dawn .
can i talk to you about my head ?
drive !
ready my coffin .
she don' t look ready , she need a nap .
i' m readyin ' the coffin cos we gettin ' the fuck out of here .
