hiya , bruce .
how ya feelin ' ?
grub okay in here for ya ?
what do you want ?
that' s a good question .
see , i need your cells to trigger some chemical distress signals .
you know , so you can turn a little green for me again ... and i can carve off a piece of the real you , analyze it , patent it , make a fortune .
do you mind ?
i' il never let you .
i' m not sure you' ve got much of a choice .
come on , bruce .
aren' t you feeling a little angry ?
after all , you' ve only got me to play with now that betty' s dumped you and gone back to berkeley .
you' re lying .
you know , for me this is a win win situation .
you turn green , and all these guys come in and kill you ... and i perform the autopsy .
you don' t ...
and i mop the floor with you ... and maybe by accident go too far and break your neck .
bad science , maybe ... but personally gratifying .
come on , bruce !
let' s see what you got .
never .
you know , consciously you may control it , but subconsciously , i bet that' s another story .
all right , let' s jump start those brain waves .
bruce .
my dear miss ross .
welcome back .
there are two guards right outside .
you don' t have to worry .
i' m not angry with you .
not anymore .
what do you want ?
it' s over for me now .
i know that .
and soon it' il be over for bruce .
that' s why i' ve come to you ... to ask you if you could persuade your father , as a man , as a father himself , that if i turn myself in now , peacefully ... and before he puts me away forever , that he would let me see my son ... for one last time .
could you do that for me ?
it' s out of my father' s hands now .
i understand .
he' s a puppet now .
i don' t blame him .
you shouldn' t .
you should blame yourself for what you' ve done to your son .
and what have i done to my son , miss ross ?
nothing .
i tried to improve on the limits in myself .
myself !
not him !
can you understand ?
to improve on nature .
my nature !
knowledge of oneself !
it' s the only path to the truth ... that give men the power to go beyond god' s boundaries !
you know what' s beyond your boundaries ?
other people .
all you' ve given bruce is fear .
fear of life .
fear ?
perhaps , miss ross .
and loneliness too .
yes ...
i feel them both .
but i have lived ... completely once .
i was so much in love , and she so much wanted a baby .
my baby .
i could tell from the moment she conceived ... that it wasn' t a son i had given her ... but something else .
a monster , maybe .
i should have put a stop to it right then , but i was curious and that was my downfall .
and as i watched this tiny life unfold ,
i began to imagine the horror of it , and my curiosity was replaced ... with compassion .
but they took away my chance to cure him .
your father threw me out .
what are you doing ?
i remember that day so well ... every moment , every sensation ... walking into the house , the feeling of the handle of the knife in my hand .
i knew i was doing a father' s work , fulfilling a father' s mercy .
david , please stop it . !
no . !
david , no . !
talk to me . !
listen . !
but then she surprised me .
no . !
no . !
david , no !
it was as if ... she and the knife ... merged .
no !
you cannot imagine ... the unbearable finality of it .
and in that one moment ...
i took everything that was dear to me ... and transformed it into nothing more ... than a memory .
bingo !
that must be some jumbo nightmare he just had .
okay , do it now .
start the enzyme extraction .
sir , negative on drill penetration .
damn it , drill him harder !
give him full rpms .
come on , holeman !
come on !

it' s you he' s coming for .

let' s take a walk .
that' s the deal , gentlemen .
he stays on this base ... until we get the final word from c 3 on how to dispose of him .
in the meantime , ifhe does anything but sit there in that chair , we' re gonna turn on the juice and he' il be incinerated immediately .
we' ve established a 200 yard perimeter , sir .
if we deploy the electromagnetic array , there should be no collateral damage .
here they come . !
i' m doin ' this for you , betty .
but one way or another , we' re gonna have to prepare for the worst .
i should have killed you .
and i should have killed you .
i wish you had .
i saw her last night .
saw her face .
brown hair .
brown eyes .
she smiled at me .
she reached down and kissed my cheek .
i can almost remember a smell .
almost like desert flowers .
her favorite perfume .
it' s my mother , and i don' t even know her name .
it' s all right , son .
you go ahead and cry .
go ahead and cry .
cry .
crying will do you good .
don' t touch me !
maybe once you were my father , but you' re not now and you never will be .
oh , is that so ?
well , i got news for you .
i didn' t come here to see you .
i came here to see my son .
my real son .
the one inside of you .
you' re nothing but a superficial shell , a husk of flimsy consciousness ... ready to be torn off at a moment' s notice .
you can think what you like .
i don' t care .
just go !
no , son .
listen to me .
i found a cure .
for me .
my cells can transform too , absorb enormous amounts of energy .
but , unlike you , they' re unstable .
son , i need your strength .
i gave you life .
now you must give it back to me !
only a million times more radiant , more powerful !
stop it .
stop ?
stop what ?
stop what ?
think about all those men out there in their uniforms ... barking and swallowing orders , inflicting their petty rule over the entire globe !
think of all the harm they' ve done !
to you !
to me !
to humanity !
and know this ... that we can make them ... and their flags and their anthems and their governments ... disappear in a flash !
you in me .
i' d rather die .
oh , that' s your answer ?
then indeed you shall die ... and be reborn ... a hero ... of the kind that walked the earth ...
long before the pale religions of civilization ... infected humanity' s soul !
go !
stop your bawling , you weak little speck of human trash .
all right ...
i' il go !
you just watch me go !
hit it .
hit it again !
we can' t , sir .
there' s no power .
some kind of counter electromagnetic field .
move in and assault the target .
move in . !
move , move , move !
sir , i' ve located them on radar .
pear lake .
call up the task force .
yes !
that' s right .
keep fighting .
the more you fight , the more of you i take .
strange .
we' re reading a phenomenal drop in temperatures there .
but simultaneous radiological activity .
they' re absorbing all the ambient energy .
sleep now , bruce , and forget forever .
struggle no more ... and give me all of your power .
you think you can live with it ?
take it !
take it all !
oh , yes !
yes !
take it back !
it' s not stopping !
take it back !
gentlemen ... release .
gamma charge away .
mwah !
sweet dreams .
hello ?
betty , is that you ?
hi , dad .
i' m glad i caught you .
i' m glad you called .
thanks .
look , betty ... you and i ... well , we both know that bruce couldn' t have survived that blast .
but ... well , you know ...
what is it ?
well , you know .
the usual loonies .
seein ' things .
only now everything' s green .
right .
look , uh ... if by some chance he did survive ... and he should try to contact you , try to get in touch , you' d tell me , wouldn' t you ?
no ...
i wouldn' t .
but you know as well as i do , i wouldn' t have to .
i mean , my phones are bugged , my computer' s tapped .
i' m under surveillance .
i' il tell you , though , that if he were alive ,
i' m the last person i would want him to come to ... because ... as much as i miss him ,
i ...
i ... loved him .
i , um ...
yeah .
i' m sorry , betty .
i am so sorry .
i know you are .
si .
let' s take a walk .
