of course for a sushi master you need the best tools
if you stand aimlessly at a phone booth on a rainy day and meet a man whose face is covered by a violet umbrella ,
i' d suggest that you get close to the tv
the television is both a clock and calendar
it' s your school , home church , friend and lover
but ...
but , my lover' s song is too short
this morning around 7 : 30 the top 50m of the sungsoo bridge in seoul suddenly collapsed in the middle ...
i wrote down all the people whom i fought with , bothered , and hurt
this was both my prison journal and autobiography of my evil deeds
i thought i had lived an average life but i' ve sinned too much
all i thought about at that moment was that the guy next door probably ate with one chopstick
but ...
but
who would' ve imprisoned me ?
was it yoo heung sam ?
lee so young or kang changsuk ?
whoever it was , just wait
wait a bit more

even if i fall to my death i' m still getting out
i' m getting out i' m getting out in one month , i' m getting out
right now you' re lying on a plain

mister

that fever remedy really works

the bathroom door is broken and doesn' t lock

or else i' il slice you like sushi

ristedal solution

who' s mido ?
this girl who cries over nothing
joo hwan
did i really talk too much ?
my friend ,
i' d like for you to find that criminal among people you' re close to
congratulations
your case was automatically dismissed yesterday
but remember this by all means
open quote
like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter ...
like a bird from the snare of the fowler ...
free yourself
close quote who are you ?
what about you you rotten bastard ?
i made up my mind when i was imprisoned
that i won' t trust anyone if i get out
if there' s anyone who i find suspicious then i' il create a secret that person and i will only know
that id , monster , is a trap that i made to catch you
you lead a stranger to your place who the hell are you ?
who' s evergreen ?
i tracked down that evergreen id and found the owner' s name
ready to jot it down ?
it' s su daeoh , that' s a strange rare surname
address ?
in eungam
saewoon apartments building 7 , room 407
i' m not doing fine within life in a bigger prison ...
evergreen
who are you ?
you meant to ask this , right ?
you must find out on your own come on , it' s a game
first , who ?
then , why ?
if you figure it out come see me anytime
i' il raise your score you have until july 5th
oh no , only five days left
too short ?
hang in there if you succeed i' il kill myself and not mido
that' s right , mido
i' m going to kill every woman you love until you die
well , you' re notorious for not protecting your women
wow , you' re strong mr. monster
yes , you are the very monster i created
but you won' t find out the " why ? " if you do this 15 years of being curious would go to waste so is that okay with you ?
sit down there
oh , the famous teeth torture
you won' t have enough time to torture me
since i have a weak heart i have a pacemaker in my chest
when it was put in know what i asked the doctor ?
doctor hopkins give me a remote control to turn that motor off
pardon ?
why ?
so that i can kill myself easily at anytime
i' il give you $100, 000 more
oh , what will you do ?
you want to kill me right away but you won' t know why you were imprisoned
you want to torture me but i say i' il kill myself first
do you seek revenge or do you find the truth ?
oh , you' re in a tough spot
i' ve been watching over you for 15 years
i faired well thanks to you
i wasn' t bored or lonely
seeking revenge is the best cure for someone who got hurt
try it
the loss of 15 years the pain of losing your wife and child you can forget all this
once again revenge is good for your health
but ...
what happens after you' ve revenged yourself ?
i bet that hidden pain will probably come back again
are you there , daesu ?
daesu ,
long time no see
hasn' t she been tied up for too long ?
i think you also left the door open
please save me
but i could die first rudolph the red nosed reindeer had a very shiny nose
this dentist is really good
don' t move
don' t move
what' s with you ?
now ...
here we go
you see they say that people shrivel up because they have an imagination
so do not imagine
you' il become brave as hell
now , here comes the real thing
yes ?
you know i' m glad you told me about this place but i haven' t even started
what ?
