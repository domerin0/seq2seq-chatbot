the news traveled quickly .
there was land to be had , and lots of it .
the reports made western new york sound like paradise , at least to my brother and father , two vermont rock farmers .
87 1/ 2 acres northwest corner of plat 1 3 , palmyra township .
congratulations , mr. steed .
you own one of the finest tracts of land in upstate new york .
congratulations , sir !
thank you .
no , i' m not going !
melissa , this is so
how can father do this ?
we don' t even know anyone in new york .
you mean you don' t know anyone like john connelly .
joshua !
this is very hard on her .
this is hard on all of us .
we do as we' re told , right ?
let' s get on with it !
hyah !
giddyup !
so on the eve of my 1 6th birthday father announced we would move .
he and nathan went ahead , and we would follow in time for spring planting .
we had never heard of palmyra , new york or of a man named joseph smith .
and we had no way of knowing that for the steed family our journey was just beginning .
ben ?
ben !
what ?
who knows you' re here ?
no one .
mr. steed !
except my family .
ho !
pa !
pa !

let me see if , uh , i got this right .
joshua' s the old one .

i hear you' re quite the worker .
get more work done than most men times two .
then again , nathan also says that only happens about once a year and only if a young lady is watchin ' .
martin' s been the best of neighbors .
he helped us survey the property lines .
thank you , mr. harris .
not at all .
i' m just glad you' re finally here .
ben' s been antsier than a bear in a beehive .

ah , nothin ' will be happenin ' without a decent chain .
josh !
saddle one of the mules and ... and take this in to the blacksmith .
do you hear me , son ?
we' ve been working on this stump all afternoon , and it hasn' t budged an inch .
i say we do what everyone else does and leave it and get on with clearing some land .
there will be no stumps on my farm .
now take the chain in and get it fixed .
pa , you was nearly killed .
i say it stays .
ho , ben .
just heading into town .
can i pick up something for you ?
no , thank you , martin .
josh is just on his way .
hickory , huh ?
hickory is vermont stubborn .
thought we' d never get our place cleared .
it' s coming fine .
but if we don' t get enough wheat and corn in ... we' re gonna have a tough winter .
ever thought of hirin ' help ?
spring' s comin ' on hard now .
you' re going to want to be plantin ' within the month .
got that money left over from the farm sale , pa .
i know a family a mile or two south of town , they got two boys that hire out .
i used them myself and right pleased with their work .
what' s their names ?
smith .
love this place .
best part of town .
that' s why i work here .
my ma and sisters won' t come anywhere near here .
yeah , you don' t want to bring your ma around here .
hey , this is it .
whoa !
much obliged , steed .
any time , caleb .
sure you don' t want to come in and meet the boys ?
no , i got to run over to main street .
pick up some help that pa' s hired .
and i got a stop to make before that , so ...
a stop ?
yeah !
i saw you two at the dance .
careful , steed .
yee ah !
what can i get you ?
i got a list of things .
i just need to check out some tools first .
over there .
thanks .
oh , mr. mcbride ?
do you know the smiths down on stafford road ?
why ?
well , my pa has hired two of their sons , hyrum and joseph .
i' m supposed to meet them .
you' re new around here .
yeah .
none of my business , but you might want to tell your pa to think about that .
i need some help down here !
mr. steed .
hello , lydia .
how may i help you , mr. steed ?
my mother needs a few things .
of course .
it' s always a pleasure to help your mother .
you look right pretty today , lydia .
right pretty .
if you' il follow me , sir , um , i' il help you get those things together .
do you know those men ?
why ?
what do you want with them ?
my pa has hired them to clear some land .
i' m supposed to take them up to our place .
hyrum smith .
my brother , joseph .
joshua steed .
joshua , good to meet you .
day labor eating with us ?
you know how i feel about that .
we' ve worked a long day , mary ann .
remember the ones in rutland ?
foul mouthed , lazy riffraff .
they' re not like that , ma .
you should have seen them .
cleared near a full acre .
could hardly get ' em to stop for supper .
well , becca' s smitten .
and matthew adores them .
pull , matthew .
you got me again .
this boy' s an ox , mr. steed .
one more ?
no , you go help your sister .
you plum wrestled him out , matthew .
he' s got nothing left ... for a real man' s game .
might be good to show the smith boys here what vermont stubborn really means .
joshua is the champion stick puller in rutland .
never seen anyone stand him up .
you leave joseph and hyrum be .
they worked hard today .
yeah , ma' s right .
big slice of humble pie .
doesn' t sit well with a good meal .
i like pie .
i' il wager joseph can throw you over three times straight .
loser has to pull out that old hickory stump .
that work must have shook your brains loose .
i thought you were smarter , being older and all .
hey , what do you say , joseph , are you going to stand by your brother ?
always .
i don' t like this , ben .
well , let' s get on with it so the smiths can start digging .
somebody' s going to get hurt .
are you just going to sit there and let them do this ?
need plenty of room .
don' t want anyone having an advantage .
now ...
here' s how it works .
three pulls .
first time joshua throws joseph , over .
draw ... for hand position .
you know what ?
you can take the outside .
i don' t want you to have any excuses when you lose .
okay .
alright , nathan , you might want to move that barrel .
that' s exactly where joseph' s going to land .
alright , good clean pull .
ready ?
ready .
pull !
that' s one .
watch your grip , son .
watch your grip .
ready ?
pull !
pull , joshua .
that' s two .
one more and we' re done .
don' t let me down , son .
don' t let me down .
come on , joseph !
put him in his place , joseph !
ready ?
pull !
tomorrow we' il just hook you up to that hickory stump .
spare the mules .
well done , joshua .
it' s been a long time since i came that close to being beaten .
yeah .
whoa .
alright , no sense in us all going in .
ah , sure there is .
i can sit on her pa .
joseph can hog tie her ma .
and you can say hello to miss lydia .
go on , get out of here .
we' il be back .
yes ?
why , mr. steed .
i didn' t know you were in town .
lydia .
good afternoon .
joshua steed .
these are my very best friends in the whole world .
abby pierce .
rilda jane freeman .
ladies .
blast .
you coming to the barn raising saturday ?
i' il watch for you .
my brother nathan .
miss lydia mcbride .
pleased to meet you .
i can tell you are a steed .
you look very much like your mother .
i' d better go .
saturday .
yeah !
pleasure to meet you , miss .
well , if it ain' t joe smith .
it is old joe himself .
let' s go pay our respects .
afternoon , miss lydia .
mr. murdock .
out here learning more about them angels , are ya ?
no , just came from a recital .
will murdock .
you must be the new family out by the harris place ?
this is my brother , david .
cousin , mark .
joshua .
my brother , nathan .
and joseph , who you seem to already know .
oh , yeah .
we know all about old joe , don' t we ?
how are you today , sir ?
fine , will .
you got that gold bible yet ?
ain' t joe told you about his gold bible ?
shame , joe .
people around here just love that story , especially the part about them angels flying around your house .
heard tell the waiting time is over this fall .
that true ?
think your pa will take gold in payment for supplies , miss lydia ?
oh , i imagine we' il be buying our things same as other folks .
joe , what does an angel look like ?
was it a boy angel or a girl angel ?
yeah , why don' t you send one of those angels to tell us where to find some buried treasure ?
we' il be waitin ' ... for the gold .
alright , so what' s all this about a gold bible and angels ?
you really think angels go around showing people where to find buried treasure ?
uh uh .
good .
neither do l .
they said something about a gold bible .
when a donkey brays do you think he is always saying something important ?
alright !
go !
go !
go !
hyah !
come on !
hyah !
come on !
hyrum !
come on , push .
come on !
hyah !
now ... where' s the hard one ?
i' il go help unhook it .
watch out for hornets .
so , hyrum .
in town yesterday , some men stopped joseph , said something about a gold bible .
the murdocks .
they also said something about angels .
josh .
it is not our place to pry .
well ?
anyone who wants to know about that ... would have to ask joseph .
do you ask this for yourself ?
or is it just because of the things you' ve heard ?
the only thing i' ve heard is what will murdock said .
you mean you haven' t heard that joe smith is a lazy , no account drunkard immoral , untrustworthy , utterly unattractive .
well , there may be some truth to that .
maybe you' ve heard of our family .
how we' re all grave robbers , devil worshippers , and the like ?
i don' t believe any of that .
neither does my family .
thank you .
why would anyone say that ?
if we talk , you' il be late for supper .
it' s not for an hour .
i' il not ask you to believe what i tell you , nathan .
but i' d appreciate it if you' d hear me through to the end .
you ever been to a camp meeting ?
revival ?
heard of them , but we never went .
pa says they' re organized madness .
that' s not far off .
i was about 1 4 when they came to this area .
the bible says god has already decided on who will be saved .
so i admonish each of you to search your hearts to see if god has elected you .
that' s false doctrine , reverend !
and we won' t stay a minute longer !
so many different faiths .
so many opinions .
so much anger .
i wondered who , of all these parties , are right .
or are they all wrong together ?
if any one of them be right , which is it ?
and how can i know it ?
thank you , dear .
let patience have her perfect work ,
that ye may be perfect and entire , wanting nothing .
if any of you lack wisdom ,
iet him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally
and upbraideth not , and it shall be given him .
but let him ask in faith , nothing wavering .
father ... in heaven .
as i was praying , i saw ... a pillar of light .
it was exactly over my head .
it gradually descended .
when the light rested upon me , i saw two personages .
personages ?
yes , two beings .
their brightness and glory defy all description .
one of them spoke to me and called me by name and said ,
this is my beloved son .
hear him .
i saw god , nathan .
and i saw his son , jesus christ .
i know how ... that must sound to you .
but i say again , i saw god the father and i saw his son .
nathan ?
what did they look like ?
glorious .
beyond description .
the light from them was so brilliant
i thought the leaves would catch fire .
when i finally gathered my senses , you can imagine how i felt .
this is not what i expected .
anyway , i asked which of the churches i should join .
and ?
i was told to join none of them .
i' ve got to get back .
nathan .
i know what you' re thinking .
trust your heart on this .
evening .
steed .
joshua .
remember mr. steed ?
drink ?
good , ain' t it ?
he holds the shine better than you do , coop .
have a seat , steed .
so ...
why you taking on with joe smith ?
i ain' t taking on with him .
pa hired him and his brother to clear land .
if it was me , i' d send him packin ' .
them smiths is daft lunatics .
people are talking about your family .
wondering if you' re taking up with them .
what was that stuff you boys were saying about angels , gold bible ?
you ain' t heard ?
what ?
smith says some angel came to him in his room one night and told him where some old book is buried .
joe says it' s like the bible .
and it' s written on gold plates .
you believe that ?
not about the angel .
but suppose there is gold .
and suppose we follow joe when he goes to get it .
there is a lot of treasure buried in these parts .
spanish brought a lot of gold up here .
so if there' s gold , then where is it ?
buried in a hill down by the smiths ' .
the angel said joe needed to wait some before he could get it .
the angel said .
listen , the word is , time' s up this fall .
me and the boys , we plan on being there when smith takes out the gold .
ma .
it' s early .
it' s easter sunday .
couldn' t just stay in bed .
pa could .
he had a lot to drink last night .
if you believe miss sloan , so did joshua .
she saw him ?
with the murdocks .
oh , that' s why he never came home .
your father' s gonna have a problem with that .
what are you reading ?
john , last part .
remember our new year' s resolutions ?
mine was to read the four gospels again by easter .
i' m almost there .
mary' s just come to the empty tomb .
good place to be reading this morning .
i could have finished yesterday , but i wanted to save it .
if jesus was resurrected , is he still alive ?
of course .
as a real being ?
a person ?
thomas felt his hands and feet .
that' s pretty real .
but that was 2, 000 years ago .
so ?
could he appear to someone now ?
well , he appeared to mary , to paul .
i suppose he could now , why ?
nathan ?
joshua told you what happened in town the other day , with joseph ?
we don' t hold with gossip , nathan .
i know , but ... when i walked home with them ...
i asked joseph why people were saying those things about him .
it' s none of our affair .
ma , i wanted to know .
he said when he was 1 4 , he was confused about which church to join .
and he read in james ,
i think it was the first chapter , and it said ,
if you lack wisdom , ask of god .
becca , help your sister with the bowls .
happy easter , papa .
well , happy easter to you , matthew .
what time did joshua come in last night ?
he' s not here .
i' il be back .
ben !
we don' t even know where he is .
he' s probably on his way home now .
you know , he don' t need you stickin ' up for him .
ben !
it' s easter morning .
come and eat .
he' il be along .
what are you doing here ?
i was looking for you all night .
you looked pretty busy to me .
i was hoping you' d come over .
lydia , we' re late !
i have to go .
wednesday , father and mother are going to waterloo .
i' il be staying with my aunt on canandaigua road .
my aunt isn' t nearly as strict as father .
will you come ?
lydia !
i' il come .
now , upon the first day of the week , very early in the morning , they came unto the se
sepulcher .
sepulcher .
sorry i didn' t come home last night , ma .
i was with some friends .
friends ?
would that be the murdocks ?
matthew , becca , we need eggs .
look at me .
i asked if you thought those two rum soaked pieces of river trash were your friends .
you don' t even know them .
everybody else in town seems to know them .
they' re tavern rats .
you' d know all about tavern rats , wouldn' t you , pa ?
we only had to wait but an hour while you and your friends
iifted a few mugs of your own .
joshua !
what did you say ?
beg your pardon .
so the little mcbride girl wouldn' t give you the time of day , so you go off with your so called friends and get drunk .
you leave lydia out of this .
she' s a spoiled daughter of a high minded storekeeper who thinks that farmers like us are no better than stray livestock .
and if you think that you' re going to impress her with your patched up trousers and your manure covered boots , then you' re a bigger fool than i thought !
ben , that is uncalled for !
how do you know what i did last night ?
you chose to be with trash and now people are wondering whether or not joshua steed is trash too .
who cares what people think ?
you better care !
you' re just worried if joshua steed stinks , someone might think his revered father stinks too !
you' d better watch your mouth , boy .
if you' re so worried about what people think , you might want to fire the smiths .
the smiths ?
go to town , pa .
listen to what people are saying about joe smith and about you for hiring them .
what are they saying about joseph ?
joe says an angel brought him a gold bible and it' s buried in some hill somewhere and he' s gonna translate it and save the world .
who i hire is my business .
no , pa , you' re worried about stink .
well , joe smith and his angels , they stink to high heaven .
and if you don' t care about that , then you can stop caring about who my friends are ,
' cause i decide who my friends are , and who they are not , and i do not need your permission .
as long as you live in this house , and you eat at this table , you need my permission .
then i' il get my things .
joshua , no .
i' il come and help out with the farm , but from now on , i' il be staying in town .
don' t do us any favors .
i won' t be comin ' for you , pa .
i' il be comin ' for them .
it' s alright , ma .
it' s alright .
it' s alright .
it' s time .
it' s alright .
let him go .
mr. steed .
won' t you come in ?
mr. steed .
i finished up the work that i had for you .
i won' t be needing you anymore .
you' re gonna have to stop beating everyone at stick pull .
afternoon .
are you mrs. gates ?
last i checked .
i' m nathan steed .
i heard your niece , lydia , might be staying with you .
maybe .
maybe not .
what' s your name again ?
nathan steed .
we live north of town .
ah , steed .
i never met one of you ' til yesterday .
now my house is run over with steed boys .
you' ve seen my brother .
joshua .
here last night .
stayed way too long .
guests and salmon , you know , after four hours they stink .
would lydia know where he is now ?
likely .
she' s probably in the library .
tie your horse .
you can go in through the back .
thank you .
miss lydia .
your aunt said you were here .
i' m sorry , i should have made more noise .
no .
you play beautifully .
verdinae .
you know verdinae ?
the queen' s symphony .
you surprised me , nathan .
hello , once again .
i' m looking for joshua .
he told me about what happened with your father .
i' m sorry .
ma' s worried about him .
sent me with some things .
i told him he should talk to your father .
he won' t .
well , do you know where he' s staying ?
will murdock' s .
you knew he got work at the dock , at a warehouse .
is he there now ?
probably .
but he' il be along after work .
just wait .
may l ?
of course .
let' s go out back .
it' s cooler there .
your aunt' s garden is beautiful .
it' s a very old place .
i used to play here with my cousins .
the flowers match your dress .
thank you .
joshua .
hello , little brother .
ma sent some bread and things .
melissa sent your jacket .
thanks .
i was hoping you' d come .
i told you i would .
how' s ma ?
worried .
melissa said you can have her warming stone if you decide to come back .
i' m not coming back .
i know .
ma wants you to come for supper sunday .
it' d be good , joshua .
listen , here' s some of my wages .
give them to pa to hire some help with .
pa fired joseph and hyrum .
well , good for him .
josh .
it is .
people in town are talking .
joseph and hyrum are good workers .
those wild stories
they aren' t wild stories .
my friend' s parents heard it straight from joseph' s father about him going in the woods and seeing angels .
he never said he saw angels .
it doesn' t matter what he said .
stuff you' d hear in an asylum and pa' s smart to be rid of them .
tell ma and melissa thank you .
you comin ' sunday ?
i don' t know .
take care , josh .
i' il leave your things .
thank you .
i wonder what a certain father will say when he finds a dock worker' s been calling on his only daughter .
but you kind of like that , don' t you ?
no .
be honest , child .
i wasn' t thinking
sometimes the forbidden fruit seems the sweetest , but you have to ask yourself , will the fruit get sweeter with age or just go bland ?
good night , aunt edie .
did you know the brother is your age ?
who ?
the brother , nathan .
they' re different .
he knew about verdinae .
good night , dear .
hello there , missy .
you gonna need some company tonight ?
i' ve seen you walking by here !
lydia !
joshua !
come on !
in here .
i thought you weren' t coming .
this is a horrible place .
out there , not in here .
i can' t stay long .
what' s this ?
regressing from man to ape .
that' s what the foreman wants around here is apes .
just keep those bales moving onto the barges , you animals .
steward croft is looking for a store clerk .
yeah , at half the pay i' m making here .
but twice the working conditions .
lydia !
in a year , maybe year and a half ,
i' il have enough money to buy my own team and wagon .
is that what you want ?
you should move back home .
you could still work here , but it would save you room and board .
four dollars a month is worth it not to have to live under pa' s thumb .
it isn' t right being separated from your family .
i' m not going back .
let' s talk about something else .
i' ve gotta go , joshua .
i shouldn' t be here .
no , no , listen , listen , i' m sorry .
i' m really glad you came .
steed !
it' s will and david .
the murdocks ?
yeah , they' re bringing my supper .
joshua , they can' t know i was here .
don' t worry , they won' t say anything .
no !
is there another way out ?
yeah , let me walk you out .
no !
don' t tell them i was here .
steed , open up !
nathan !
hello , lydia .
it' s been a while .
been helping mr. harris get his corn in .
oh , here , let me .
where would you like it ?
over there .
thank you .
i was in town and thought i' d get some candy for the kids .
oh , alright .
uh , four of these .
what else ?
five of these .
have you seen joshua ?
not often .
he works a lot .
we were hopin ' he' d come for ma' s birthday .
i stopped at the warehouse , he wasn' t there .
he' s with the murdocks a lot , at the tavern .
i left a note at the boarding house , but if you see him , could you give him that message ?
what message ?
hello , lydia .
spendin ' an awful lot of time in town lately , aren' t you ?
ma' s birthday' s sunday .
i know .
she' d like you to come to dinner .
i don' t know if i can .
don' t know if you can , or don' t know if you will ?
i said i don' t know if i can .
suit yourself .
but i think you owe it to ma .
thanks .
tell your mother happy birthday for me .
good afternoon , mr. steed .
emma smith .
oh .
you' re nathan , aren' t you ?
you' re joseph' s wife .
last week at the blacksmith' s .
i don' t expect you to remember me .
oh , i do , though .
how is joseph ?
he was just speaking of you the other day .
he was wondering how the crops turned out with your family .
we did well , thanks to him and hyrum .
do you mind if we cross the street ?
of course .
hey .
i hate this .
mrs. joe smith .
excuse us , please .
what' s your hurry ?
where' s joe nowadays ?
heard he fled the country .
mrs. smith has an appointment .
excuse us .
oh , look at this , luke .
mrs. smith' s got herself an escort .
please let us pass .
he even says please .
move .
are you alright ?
yes .
nathan helped me .
thank you , nathan .
where you been , joe ?
been lookin ' for more treasure down there in pennsylvania ?
you got that gold bible yet ?
hey , joe , them angels letting you and the missus sleep at night ?
the wagon is down by the barn .
make way .
make way for what ?
we' re coming through , will .
come on , nate .
we just want to ask joe some questions .
ain' t nobody gonna get hurt .
get out of the way , will .
now that ain' t no way to talk to an old friend ,
mister high and mighty nathan steed .
this a relative of yours , josh ?
yeah ... after a manner of speaking .
hello , joshua .
joseph .
so you' re a part of this too ?
want answers just like everyone else .
no answers today , josh .
emma and i were just leaving .
i asked you that last spring .
you didn' t answer me then , either .
so what about this gold bible , joe ?
does it even exist ?
that' s enough .
you' ve shamed the family enough .
now , what about those plates ?
where are they ?
them spirits tell you when you' re going to get ' em ?
you boys should know all about spirits .
all that time you' re spending down at phelps tavern .
all you fine christian people !
is this what you teach on sunday ?
bigotry !
a decent woman gets accosted on our streets and there' s not a man here with the courage to say a thing !
think of that sunday while you' re on your knees saying your prayers !
you , too ?
i didn' t say anything .
yeah , i noticed .
nathan .
what a nice surprise !
please , come in !
no , i can' t .
i just wanted to talk to joseph .
mother smith , this is nathan steed who helped us in town today .
joseph , it' s nathan steed .
oh , please .
come in and sit down .
we' ve got pie in the kitchen .
oh , i really can' t .
nathan .
emma , fetch father and the children .
mama , who is it ?
really , mrs. smith .
i' ve got to get back .
nathan , give up .
no one refuses mother .
i' m surprised i can walk .
mother' s pie is legend .
joseph ?
you can ask , nathan .
it' s probably none of my affair and if it isn' t , just say so .
i think it may be very much your affair .
everyone talks about you seeing angels and having a gold bible .
is there any truth to all this ?
do you have gold plates or a gold bible ?
no .
can i ask you a question ?
have you thought about what i told you before ?
yes .
a lot .
i don' t know .
part of me wants to believe it .
i mean , i know you' re not a liar , joseph .
but part of me says , this is incredible .
god appearing to a 1 4 year old ?
i' m sorry .
no , no , don' t be .
i feel the same .
sometimes i wonder , why did this happen to me ?
i don' t know .
i just know that it did .
mother believes you .
she does ?
she' s prayed about it , for months .
says she just knows .
that means a great deal to me , nathan .
will you tell her that ?
now about these gold plates ...
you said there weren' t any .
i said i don' t have them ... and i don' t ... yet .
that' s the biggest cartload of nonsense i' ve ever heard .
there is no need to be insulting , ben .
i just can' t believe that a son of mine would , would sit there and listen to talk of angels and buried gold plates without even so much as lifting an eyebrow .
what' s the lying fool going to say next ?
do you believe this tripe ?
i know how you feel , ben .
but think about it .
what if it' s true ?
the heavens opened again ,
god speaking to his children like in bible times .
ben , what if it is true ?
it' s not !
the boy' s a raving lunatic straight out of an asylum .
pa , we know joseph .
he worked with us all that time .
i don' t i don' t think he' s a liar .
he doesn' t have to be lyin ' .
have you ever heard of being deceived ?
it' s the devil' s work , mary ann .
and you talk about it , you talk about it out of my presence .
pa !
no !
it' s crazy talk .
and god help the fool who listens to it .
is this it ?
got to be !
mr. harris said it was the next road up , just across the creek .
it' s hard for me to see you in so much pain , dear .
oh , aunt edie !
it looks so forward of me coming to his home .
you' re right !
we' il just turn around and go back home .
no one will be the wiser .
on the other hand , if you' il just go on in and get this over with , maybe we can get back to life as we know it .
he should be out here .
he' s been working on the fence for hours .
i' d love to watch his face when he sees you .
but i' il be back at the house .
thank you .
you' ve come because of what happened in town , with joseph and his wife .
did he tell you ?
he was so angry with the people .
but you being there ...
i think that bothered him most of all .
i just saw a crowd and came to see what was going on .
i wasn' t part of it .
that' s what i told him .
how did you know ?
i guessed .
i' m so glad you' ve come to talk to him .
i hope he' il listen .
it' il be fine .
go ahead .
thank you , melissa .
hello , nathan .
well ?
well ...
did you talk to him ?
we talked .
come on , girl .
the whole story or i' m dropping you off right here .
we had a very nice talk .
how nice ?
did you touch his hand ?
did he touch yours ?
did you take his arm ?
was there a hug with the good bye ?
none of your business .
so what about the brother ?
joshua ?
mmm .
what about him ?
are you going to make a choice , dear ?
or just tear this poor family to shreds by driving both of them out of their minds ?
tonight .
for sure .
we' ve been watching his place .
he has them now , hidden in the woods .
but tonight he' s bringing ' em home .
how do you know ?
joe' s paid a cabinet maker in town to make him a chest .
told gilson it had to be a strong one , with a lock on it .
hyrum smith picked up the chest this morning .
well , then , will , get the boys together .
tonight' s the night .
lydia , what are you doing out ?
how did you know where i was ?
someone at the dock said you were here .
we need to talk , joshua .
we will , later .
waiting for some friends .
we' re going out to the smiths ' .
what friends ?
why ?
lydia , joe' s getting the gold tonight .
everyone in town has been buzzing about these plates for years .
we' re going to be the first ones to see them .
steed !
just ... just wait here .
one hour .
then we can talk .
joshua .
saddle up , steed .
murdock ?
just wait inside .
i' il be back .
willard chase has been watching from his place , says joe' s fixing to leave any time .
you have guns .
lydia , lydia , nobody' s going to get hurt , okay ?
the guns are just to make sure joe doesn' t get away .
lydia !
you' re talking about robbery !
not robbery !
that gold ain' t smith' s .
it' s buried treasure , and it belongs to all of us !
woman getting skittish ?
shut up !
lydia , i' m just asking for one hour .
no , joshua .
you' re asking for a lot more than that .
he' s headed up the hill .
will , you and me are following .
you two head up armington road , hide where it meets stafford .
how are you going to get it down there ?
joe' s coming back this way .
if we miss him , you' ve got to get him .
let' s go !
stick it right in here .
and just be careful that you don' t stick your finger here .
just pull this real tight here .
see this hole here ?
yep .
and pull .
pa .
who on earth ?
mr. steed , may i speak with you and nathan ?
it' s very urgent .
he' s left the road .
we' re going to lose him .
this is it .
he' s in those trees .
stay here in case i miss him .
you stupid mule .
i told you to stay here .
we could have had him .
now , come on .
has he got the gold ?
oh , yeah .
come on , let' s cut him off .
alright , get behind that tree and don' t move till i say .
he' s going to come right between us .
don' t shoot .
you could hit me , too .
get him , will !
alright , let' s get this over with .
nathan !
mrs. smith , i am deeply sorry if my son had anything to do with this .
you may rest assured that before the night is through , it will be taken care of .
thank you , mr. steed .
i appreciate your coming .
do you have any idea where joseph is ?
we' d like to find him and make sure everything is al
joseph !
mother , can you get some water .
where' s father ?
he' s in the barn .
samuel .
go fetch father .
tell him i was attacked by some men out on armington road .
they may still be there .
then go to hyrum' s and get the chest .
attacked ?
twice .
joseph , did they get the record ?
they tried .
i hid it just outside .
what are you doing here , nathan ?
my brother may have been one of those who attacked you .
he and will murdock .
are you sure ?
it was dark , but ...
i could tell by his voice .
i' m sure .
i' m sorry .
i don' t hold you in any way accountable .
joseph .
pa and i are going up to armington .
it' s probably too late .
we' re going .
nathan and i will join you .
i' il tell you what , those maston boys , they don' t come into town anymore
' cause i beat ' em every stinkin ' time .
well , well .
evening , pa .
nathan .
care for a drink ?
it' s a cold night out .
i' d like a word outside .
ah , come on , pa .
have a drink , then we' il talk .
i said outside .
now , mr. steed , l
shut your mouth .
pa .
you got something to say , you can say it here .
oh , that' s good .
we' il shame the steed family once again in public .
let' s wake the town so everybody can come and see what my son here has done .
and just what have i done ?
gone after joe smith and his gold plates .
the mcbride girl came for us .
she told us what you and these mongrel dogs were doing .
i told you she was trouble .
shut up .
so was it you that hid in the woods and jumped joe from behind ...
iike a man ?
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
joseph heard your voice call for will .
why don' t you be man enough to admit it ?
i don' t see what the problem is .
he made it home alright .
joshua !
it' s plain robbery !
those plates aren' t his .
he found them .
ben , we got a problem here ?
no problem .
i just came to get my son .
joshua !
no !
don' t you ever touch me again !
ever !
get back !
don' t !
josh .
hello , martin !
ls that you ?
ben , good to see you .
you' ve been away .
indeed i was .
come on , let' s get out of the heat .
heard you were down in pennsylvania .
yeah , i just got back day before yesterday .
business ?
yes .
i was helping joseph smith translate ... the sacred record .
it' s called the book of mormon .
for six days i wrote and he translated .
how can he translate anything ?
he' s got so little schooling .
that' s the miracle .
so you' ve seen them .
you' ve seen the plates ?
joseph wishes that he could show them to people , but the angel has forbidden it .
but this has been very , very difficult for him to bear alone .
i can imagine .
i know what you are thinking , ben , and believe me ,
i had my doubts , too .
joseph' s a good boy and all , but , i mean , i was getting a lot of pressure from my wife , from other people .
why , they thought i was crazy .
so what i did was i asked joseph if he' d copy down some of the characters from the plates for me .
here , take a look .
who' s to say what these are or what they mean ?
that' s exactly what i thought .
so i took them to new york city .
what ?
new york .
went to columbia college .
i found a professor of ancient languages there ,
professor anthon , and he examined them for me , and he told me they were true ancient characters .
i best be getting on , martin .
thank you for the wine .
ben .
you can think what you will , but joseph does have a sacred record , and he is translating it through the power of god .
when it' s published i' il get you a copy .
you can see for yourself .
wanted in lndiana for pulling a gun on a lawman , he had fled to missouri , the edge of the frontier .
and in a place almost without law , had become a law unto himself .
raise you five .
you playin ' or what , steed ?
hold your horses , friend .
see your five .
and raise you fifteen .
i' m out .
me , too .
so , steed ...
i think you' re bluffing .
i' il see your twenty .
raise you twenty more .
must be a powerful hand .
why don' t we make things interesting ?
i got a freight business , not as big as yours .
two wagons , six ox , eight head of horse flesh .
what are you saying , steed ?
my company ... and everything on the table against your stock and wagons .
that greed' s going to bring you down .
i' il see you .
i' il raise you my entire outfit .
winner take all .
full house .
queens over 1 0s .
four kings .
drinks on me , boys .
for a moment i thought you were going to close your eyes and offer a prayer of thanks when papa told us to go for a walk ...
with joshua gone , it became easy for nathan and lydia to fall in love .
but we all knew the matter was far from over .
there would be the devil to pay when joshua found out .
can we walk through here ?
of course .
my friends think it' s spooky , but i love this place , it' s peaceful .
and ?
very private .
lydia , you know that i love you .
yes .
i want to ask your father' s permission to marry you .
he' il say no .
mother' s sister runs a girl' s school in boston .
they want me to go there and spend a year with her .
a year ?
mother says if i accept , she' il not stand in our way when i get back .
you should go .
i' il work while you' re gone .
a mr. knight , down by pennsylvania , wants me to hire on .
by next fall we could pay off our land free and clear .
in twelve months you' il change .
i won' t .
i can' t .
lydia , upstairs , at the end of the hall , room six .
dearest lydia , an item of great concern has come to our attention .
nathan steed has returned to palmyra from colesville a few days ago .
he says he has returned to help his father .
but sources say it is really because joseph smith has returned to the area .
when nathan came in the store yesterday ,
i confronted him and he openly admitted he has been baptized and joined smith and his followers .
stay away from my daughter !
lydia , to this point i have largely stayed out of this decision you have made , but i can be silent no longer .
these events only confirm our deep concerns about your choice of nathan steed , and i must forbid you from pursuing this relationship further .
dinner' s not quite ready .
i' m not having dinner , aunt helen .
i' m leaving for home as soon as possible .
joshua !
pa said i had some mail .
is this it ?
yes .
when did these come ?
they came back together about two weeks ago .
i asked you to mail these months ago , and they just came back ?
they came two weeks ago .
you never even mailed them .
i mailed them , joshua , but no one paid the postage when it got there .
liar !
look at the envelopes .
your precious lydia never opened them .
she sent them back without reading them .
i' ve got to go .
pa' s waitin ' .
hey !
come spring i' m going to be heading east for awhile .
it' s time to see my family .
you mean it' s time to see lydia .
i' ve got to go .
hey !
steed , you' re not welcome here .
i' il be taking your daughter out for awhile , mr. mcbride .
you' il be doing nothing of the sort !
she' il be back ... sometime .
he wouldn' t let me come see you .
that' s why i had to make a good impression .
this has been the longest ten months of my life .
why didn' t you say anything about this obsession you have with joseph smith ?
i wrote a letter .
after you' d been baptized ?
what is this fixation you have with joseph ?
does it take priority over everything we' ve planned ?
over us ?
this is not about joseph .
joseph' s been called of god .
it' s god i' m following .
then what comes first , nathan , me or this religion ?
do i come first before your parents ?
you have no idea how deeply my parents feel about this joseph smith madness .
you continue on this way and i marry you ,
i will be completely rejected by my parents .
i won' t be welcome in their home .
my name won' t be spoken in their presence again !
you' re their only daughter , they wouldn' t .
they would !
they would , nathan .
would you ask that of me ?
lydia .
i love you !
i want to marry you .
i love you .
don' t you know that ?
i love you , nathan .
i' m ready to tell my parents if they can' t accept you , then they will lose me .
but i will not do that for joseph .
he' s a fraud .
i can' t believe you' ve allowed yourself to be deceived .
lydia , l
i' m willing to choose you over my parents , nathan .
are you willing to choose me over joseph ?
is that your answer ?
lydia ... don' t do this .
good bye , nathan .
i was in fayette yesterday .
joseph finished translating the book of mormon .
e. b. grandin in town said he' d print it if joseph can come up with some kind of security .
what kind of security ?
three thousand dollars .
i' m going to mortgage my farm .
i' m going in tomorrow with a lawyer and draw up the papers .
that' s a lot of money , martin .
oh , i know .
are you certain you want to do this ?
don' t let joseph talk you into it unless you' re sure .
ben , do you feel i' m an honest man ?
of course .
i am sure .
do you think he' s lying ?
martin harris is one of the finest men that i' ve ever met , and he' s no liar .
he' s been deluded .
deluded ?
i don' t know how joseph has done this , but it' s evil and i want no part of it .
do you know that martin has mortgaged his farm and that he' s given joseph three thousand dollars ?
he hasn' t given it to joseph .
he' s given it to the printers to print the book of mormon .
joseph won' t see one penny .
well , three thousand dollars is nonsense .
if you would just come and listen to joseph , even once .
enough !
this has gone far enough here .
you' re bringing the children into this , and i' m not having this destroy our family .
what are you saying , ben ?
i' m saying there will be no mentioning joseph smith' s name in this house again .
not by you or nathan .
and if nathan won' t accept that , will you put your fist into his face too ?
i can' t speak for nathan .
nathan has his own property now .
but so help me , you are my wife , and i will speak for you , and that' s the end of it .
bring this man another .
much obliged , steed .
what brings you out this far west , caleb ?
well , i hear there' s money to be made .
weren' t in palmyra .
you you done alright , haven' t you ?
yeah , i done alright .
how are things back home ?
well , same pack of dopes sweating on the docks .
ever see the storekeeper' s daughter lydia mcbride ?
oh , yeah .
ooh , what a looker !
you mean , you ain' t heard ?
heard what ?
she and your brother ?
what about them ?
what about them ? !
they' re engaged to be married .
matthew , is your arithmetic finished ?
i' m working on it .
nathan !
hello , beautiful !
hello , son .
morning , ma .
it' s done , ma .
what is it , nathan ?
book of mormon .
really !
it' s finished ?
does it have any pictures ?
no , no pictures .
matthew , a book doesn' t have to have pictures to be wonderful .
where did you get it ?
grandin' s bookstore .
first copies went on sale yesterday .
went straight there and bought three .
this copy' s yours , ma .
i can' t .
i bought it for you .
i can' t take it , nathan .
ma , it' s my gift .
pa can' t forbid that .
your father and i have
matthew , we need eggs .
i know .
your father and i had a talk the other night .
he' s absolutely against it , nathan .
he' s forbidden me to talk about it or to read the book of mormon .
he has no right to do that !
i won' t go behind his back , nathan .
i can' t keep it .
i can .
melissa .
he hasn' t told me that i can' t have it .
both of you believe joseph .
i want to read this and find out for myself .
i don' t think this is wise .
why is pa this way ?
so hard .
that' s how he was raised , nathan .
he' s no harder on us than he is on himself .
your father' s a good man .
i pray every day that the lord will soften his heart .
but even if he doesn' t , i' m still married to him .
nathan .
good morning , pa .
i heard you were putting your floor in .
thought you might could use some help .
ma tell you i came over this morning ?
no .
did you ask for some help ?
no .
i brought her a book of mormon .
i went into town yesterday and bought her one .
don' t worry , pa .
she wouldn' t take it .
said you had already threatened her .
it' s a good thing .
no , pa .
it' s not a good thing .
it' s wrong .
you' d better watch your mouth , boy .
what right do you have to tell us what we will or won' t believe ?
you can believe what you like , but you stay away from joseph smith and his devil work .
you and your ma want to go out and join some regular church and thump the bible and say your prayers , that' s up to you .
when you start taking on with evil , i draw the line .
so just call it evil .
then bigotry' s alright ?
you' re out of line , boy .
what did grandpa steed give his life for at valley forge ?
freedom .
freedom from kings .
freedom to own your own land .
freedom to worship however you choose .
grandpa must be real proud right now .
i came over here to help you .
i don' t want your help .
i used to be proud to be a steed .
i thought it meant something .
not anymore .
my dearest lydia ,
i write you with the heaviest of hearts , for i know the distance that separates us .
this little homestead over which i labor once filled me with joy .
now the labor is drudgery .
i can hardly bear the prospect that the light of your smile will never brighten these walls .
what stands between us ?
i believe joseph smith is a man called of god to bring about a great work in our time .
you believe he is a fraud , the devil' s own servant .
the savior said , " by their fruits ye shall know them .
i enclose the fruit of joseph' s labors .
lydia , i ask no more than that .
test the lord .
there is a verse in the bible that expresses the deepest feelings of my heart for you .
please give this to lydia .
if you would truly know how i feel , read the words of john in his second epistle , first chapter , fifth verse .
yours with a love beyond measure , nathan steed .
is miss lydia here ?
she' s gone to her aunt and won' t be back until tonight .
something i can help you with ?
for lydia ?
could you see that she gets this ?
' course .
any message to go with it ?
no .
thank you , if you could just get it to her .
that i will .
got all ready ?
no , just fetching some fabric .
what did the steed girl want ?
steed ?
oh , the wagon' s leaving .
i' il be back to cook supper .
evening , little brother .
i understand you' ve been messing around in my personal life .
see , i' m not going to be a dirt farmer
iike you and pa , nathan .
i got plans .
lydia' s part of those plans .
lydia doesn' t want you .
no , but she will .
no , i won' t .
i know how to use this .
the sheriff knows you' re here .
he has a warrant out for you .
run , lydia !
josh .
this is insane .
we' re brothers .
i don' t hold any malice .
i do .
you tell pa supper' s ready ?
told him twice .
what did he say , matthew ?
nothing just kept looking out the barn door .
i asked what he was doing when i went out to feed the chickens .
this afternoon when i asked him if i could go to the village , it was like he didn' t even hear me .
set the table , melissa .
ben , what happened at nathan' s ?
remember , ben , he' s still very upset about lydia .
he said he brought you a book of mormon .
i told him i couldn' t take it .
he said that .
i' il not be going against your will , ben .
i told you that .
then i' il not be saying any more about it .
if you want my permission to read the book , you have it .
ben ?
my feelings of joseph haven' t changed .
but i' il not be tellin ' ya what to believe .
ben , joseph is going to start a church a week from tuesday down in fayette .
he' s invited nathan , melissa , and me .
melissa , too ?
she' s not sure she accepts it , and i' il not be pushing her ,
i promise you that .
but i think she' d like to go .
if i were to be baptized ?
i' il not tell you what to do .
if that' s what you want .
nathan !
hey , matthew !
can you do something important for me ?
you need eggs .
no .
can you watch the team while i load ma' s stuff in the wagon ?
you bet !
hold , mules !
hello , pa .
there' s no trace .
we' ve searched .
i think he' s gone back to missouri .
pa .
the other morning , what i said .
i' m sorry .
needed to be said .
fields are drying out .
i thought maybe next week we could work together on the plowing .
whoa !
we' re going to have to build a fence around you two just to keep the riffraff off .
thank you , ben .
we' il be home end of the week .
bye , pa .
rest the mules every few miles .
haw !
bye , pa .
bye , pa .
thank you , papa .
i love you .
i love you , papa .
i love you .
can i go , too , melissa ?
no nathan , just drive slowly .
i' il catch up .
why do you need to go into town now ?
we have to be in fayette before dark , melissa .
it will only take a minute .
i' il catch up .
have you found everything you need ?
thank you .
melissa .
don' t you look pretty .
thank you .
how are you , lydia ?
alright .
how' s nathan ?
that' s why i came .
he doesn' t know i' m here .
it' s been over a week , lydia .
i know how you feel , but nathan deserves an answer .
an answer ?
to what ?
if you would truly know how i feel , read the words of john .
now i beseech thee , lady ,
not as though i wrote a new commandment unto thee ,
but that which we had from the beginning , that we love one another .
so you threw out my package ?
we' il not have that evil thing in our house , lydia .
nathan sent it to us all wrapped up and hidden so we wouldn' t know what it was .
he didn' t send it to us , mama , he sent it to me .
did you read the letter , too ?
when i saw it was a book of mormon
i threw it in the trash where it belongs .
i want to know , did you read my letter , too , papa ?
it' s going back in the trash where it belongs .
give me that book !
lydia !
you sent me to boston to learn something .
well , i did .
i saw a different life , where different ideas are respected , examined , not feared .
you are ready to destroy this book without even looking at it .
it' s blind intolerance .
that' s not what you' ve taught me .
amen .
brothers and sisters , we are met for the purpose of organizing
the church of jesus christ again upon the earth .
mary ann morgan steed .
having been ...
entreat me not to leave thee , for whither thou goest ,
i will go , and where thou lodgest , i will lodge .
thy people shall be my people ...
and thy god , my god .
this book is not evil .
i want to believe , nathan .
i love you , nathan steed .
oh , yes !
i remember how right , how beautiful everything looked to me that day .
for the first time in months there was hope hope for me when it came my turn , hope for healing in my family , and perhaps , with tolerance , hope for us all .
