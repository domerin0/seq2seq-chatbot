you' re drunk and we' re gonna fight .
and you have that look of yours .

let' s talk about you and edith .
the little trips you take .
these damn errands .
somebody runs out of something ... ... some goddamn egg rolls , and off you go , you and edith .
egg rolls ?

egg rolls ?
what are you talking about ?
you know , you shouldn' t leave me with hank ... ... and put me in that position .
what position ?
jack , listen to me .
what ?
something' s going on .
i mean , either you want it to , or it is .
that is such a lot of horseshit .
okay ?
what is wrong with me and edith going off to get a goddamn six pack of beer ?
what are you really worried about ?
it' s you and hank being left alone together .
i see you two .
you' re horny for hank .
oh , please .
i' m supposed to feel guilty because of that ?
i' m horny for my husband .

terry !
i am not going anywhere !
the kids' il be fine .
if you' re suffering ... ... if this is such a disappointment .

what do you care ?
i don' t .
as long as you tell me the truth .
the truth ?
jack , you won' t even admit the truth .

maybe you should ask your husband to babysit our kids while we fuck .
he' d be glad to .
yeah .
well , she wouldn' t .
i think he wants to have sex with her .
why ?
why ?
yeah .
because he likes her and she' s pretty .
he hasn' t had any strange pussy since that french cunt .
i mean , why do you think he wants to ?
the way he looks at her , the way he looked at us ... ... when we came back from buying beer .
oh , yeah ?
and how was that ?
sheepish .
does that bother you ?
me ?
no .
good .
we can all babysit for each other .
she blooms , she blooms .

well , if he does , it' il be a miracle .
oh , come on , jack .

i don' t want to go to space unless daddy goes and you too .
of course daddy and i' d go with you .

i definitely agree with this .
houston , i think we got a satellite .
it' s quite a sight .
that looks good , thanks .
the alignment key is obviously in place .
go for rotate .
you can' t write , you old fuck .
let' s go for a run .

let' s run .
take it you quit .
goddamn right , goddamn it .
what' s this ?
the eighth , ninth time ?

they' re pissing me off .
they' re trying to kill me .
cigarettes don' t have souls , jack .
they don' t mean you any harm .
easy , sailor .
you all right there , princess ?
yeah , i' m fine , you competitive prick .
you sure ?
you' re a little screwed up this summer .
oh , yeah ?
can you tell ?
yep .
i should' ve worked this summer , man .
yeah .
maybe , maybe not .
i could use the money .
work more .
a man should be able to live ... ... idly for a couple of months without losing his mind .
try writing .
i have .
i' m a reader , not a writer .
pussy , not a fighter .
jesus , man .
just smoke it .
you' re hopeless .
you' il smell like an ashtray to terry .
does edith to you ?
no .
not everywhere .
i haven' t touched one since jeanne .
yes .
jeanne .
got me smoking fucking french cigarettes .
make anybody wanna quit .
did you end up seeing her before she left ?
yeah , i saw her .
remember when i went to new york to see my agent ?
i was in portland .
oh , man .
airport .
tears .
that was very romantic .
i think about running into her in paris in 10 years .
jesus , man .
what can i say ?
i' m dedicated .
i refuse to let anyone go unloved .
betty !
mom !
what ?
mom !
don' t hit her with that bat !
so why didn' t you leave her , hank ?
who ?
edith .
why would i ?
you' re in love with another woman .
jesus , this isn' t the middle ages .
what ?
it' s happened .
men have left their wives for other women and been happy .
until they start cheating on their new wife .
sure , whatever .
it' s no use talking to you .
why ?
you' re too nice to fuck somebody without feeling love .
right ?
right .
so doing it with love in the mix ... ... you' d use as proof you didn' t love terry ?
what , you been talking to my mistress ?
look , just love everybody you can .
love your kids , love your wife , keep the peace .
then once , just once ... ... try fucking somebody else just because it feels good .
your wife , you know ... ... may be living exactly according to these principles .
that' s her business , hank .
brave words .
but true .
what brought all this on , anyway ?
i don' t know .
nothing , i guess .
just see you' re unhappy and i want you to be happy .
i have a girl , so terry gets a lobster .
we get a bottle of wine and the kids get this shit .
shit .
go on , take it .
come in for a quick one .
no , i' m late .
come on .
shouldn' t .
dad !
brought home a present .
drink ?
okay , we' re going to 10 .
that' s two .
no .
that' s three !
okay , three .
four .
dad , when is it my turn ?
never .
you don' t know how to pitch .
little while , natasha .
hey , gang !
let' s go for a bike ride .
no , we' re playing catch .
please .
come on !
come on , natasha .
it' s late .
oh , come on , jack .

let' s go up the river !
yeah !

let' s ride bikes .
come on , mom .
honey , go with daddy .
i got stuff to do .
sean , get your helmet on !
what' s the name of this dance ?
" the angry housewife .
what is that ?
the death of ivan ilyich .
i' m thinking of teaching it this fall .
i was crazy the other night .
i' m sorry .
it' s okay .
i shouldn' t have gotten drunk .
forget it .
no , i gotta grow up .
what , grownups aren' t violent ?
not with their husbands .
read the newspapers .
women murder their husbands every day .
not people like us .
the other night , did hank make a pass ?
yeah .
but he was drinking .
and what ?
you' re pretty .
hank likes pretty women .
do you know how much i love you ?
yes .
it' s not just that .
it' s more than that .
it' s what ?
it' s how far you' ve come ...
... strong you' ve gotten .
do you know what i mean ?
well ?
well , what ?
well , what did he do ?
none of your business .
all right , then what did you do ?
nothing .
come on .
he tried to kiss me on the porch , so i went inside .
where ?
here ?
in the kitchen to get a glass of wine .
so he followed you into the kitchen and ...
and he told me he loved me ... ... he kissed me and said he didn' t love edith .
and i felt dirty and we went outside and sat on the front steps .
dirty because ... ... what he said about edith or because ... ?
yeah .
edith' s my friend .
she' s sweet .
she doesn' t deserve that bullshit .
i don' t wanna be any part of it .
but before that you were all right .
i wanna know what you did .
hey , can we stop this ?
or do you wanna know if his nose was to the left or to the right of mine ... ... when he kissed me ?
you remember ?
we were lying on the floor and he was on my right , so his nose was to the left .
you were lying on the floor .
goodness gracious .
i was squatting down to get my gla ...
shut up .
what ?
i' m just kidding .
no , you' re not , jack .
you' re glad he kissed me .
let' s just say i' m not disturbed by it .
well , i am !
okay .
jack .
jack .
look at me .
look at me .
it occurred to him that what had seemed impossible before ... ... that he had not spent his life as he should have , might after all be true .
hey , let' s go .
wake up .
you want some pancakes ?
i want three pancakes .
ready ?
get your plate ready .
ready .
table one .
hey , let' s go .
it' s mine !
mommy !
you guys , have a great time .
his professional duties and the whole arrangement of his life and family ... ... might all have been false .
he tried to defend all those things to himself ... ... and suddenly felt the weakness of what he was defending .
there was nothing to defend .
boring .
jim .
everything in his life turns out false ?
doesn' t do much about it .
doesn' t do much ?
he finds god .
that tiny bit at the end ?
seeing a light and there being no more pain ?
is that it ?
well , the guy does do one major thing .
what' s that ?
he dies .
and maybe tolstoy didn' t have it in his head to write some big , uplifting story ... ... about the way we' re supposed to live our lives .
maybe he just wanted to show us what it was like to die .
this is traumatic .
reading your stuff , i see little things wrong here and there , easy to fix .
and i am noticing , all of a sudden ... ... that most of you can write just as well as me .
it' s very depressing .
what happened ?
what ?
you gonna tell me you ran out of things to write about ?
i won' t believe you .
i lost focus towards the end .
my boyfriend just moved in ...
your boyfriend ?
i just mean that ...
i just wanna talk about what' s on the page .
sorry .
are you kidding ?
all right .
just this stuff .
fuck .

yeah .
i think she' s fantastic .
she is fantastic .
she just shouldn' t be married to me .
hey , you want some coffee or anything ?
no , i' m great .
thanks .
i went to the zoo last week with sharon .
that' s a depressing place .
yeah , i know .
but ... ... we were watching this gorilla .
he took a crap in his hand and then he licked it .
it' s a bit more interesting than the flamingos , i guess .
made me cry .
i told you it' s a depressing place .
he just seemed so human , you know ?
like he knew how trapped he was .
do you realize how sad it is , watching you guys ?
what do you think the difference is between you and us ?
terry loves you .
so you married ?
thirty years .
wow .
got kids ?
two .
they' re married now .
does your wife take an interest in your job , i mean ... ... does she know everything about plumbing ?
no , not at all .
nothing .
what does she do ?
she likes to garden .
it makes her happy .
did i say something wrong ?
you make me a good wife .
if i didn' t love you , i' d have to love somebody else .
see , hank needs us , but ... ... he can' t really love anyone , only his work , the rest is surface .
i don' t believe that .
i don' t mean his friendship with you .
he' d give you a kidney if you needed one .
yeah , and he' d give you one too .
of course he would ... ... but he wouldn' t go to a marriage counselor .
you know , you' re a funny girl .
after a long carnivorous fuck , you talk about a marriage counselor ?
who are you ?
you know what i wanted .
i wanted to know where we were .
now i know .
and ?
you love the person you' re having the affair with .
he' il be busting out soon .
trust me .
i know the routine .
he' s been hibernating with that novel so long .
next thing you know , he' il look around and blink ... ... and fuck the first thing that walks into his office .
i hope someone goes in there before i do .
well , he screws his wife once in a while .
why not another man ?
and your husband making passes at my wife , how do you feel about that ?
well , everybody deserves to be happy , right ?
hey .
hey .
hey .
hey .
how' d the work go ?
burned my novel , wrote a shitty poem .
how' d the shopping go ?

yep .
hank and edith are coming over to watch an old movie on cable tonight .
great .
that' s good .
hank called ?
yeah .
he called .
what ?
lobsters ?
oh , she' s beautiful .
there' s no denying that .
but you know she does nothing all day but eat , sleep , walk about ... ... fascinate us all by her beauty .
nothing more .
and an idle life cannot be ... ... pure .
hello ?
hey .
hey !
hello .
hey .

we' re celebrating .
well , i can see that .
hank ?

i haven' t had a chance to tell edith .
she' s out shopping .
you don' t seem very excited .
i am .
yeah , what do you know ?
hank , people who know you like your work .
you' re being published .
it doesn' t get much better than that .
it' s a poem , terry .
it' s really not that important .
no , hank , it isn' t .
you want important , work in a cancer ward with people puking from chemo .
or teach math to a kid who' s brain damaged from fetal alcohol syndrome .
no , those people generally aren' t that much fun to be around .
okay .
all right .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
pulling my head out of my butt .
how about a spoonful of this ... ... " dream come true " jumbo split ?
i' d rather eat vomit .
gotta fly .
hey .
do me a favor and don' t tell jack , all right ?
allow me the joy of gloating .
you' il see him before i will .
you guys are running , right ?
are we ?
oh , yeah , yeah .
we are indeed .
okay .
bye , honey .
see you .
hi .
terry' s turning over leaves .
she said her life had reached a turning point .
she said she would work .
she would start right now by paying for being a slob .
for three days after , she made the beds as soon as we got up in the morning .
she folded the laundry by 10 .
she vacuumed by noon .
she wrote lists of chores for the rest of us .
then on the fourth day ... ... her momentum suddenly stopped .
so ?
so then i checked his gym bag , and the clothes were folded and clean .
he didn' t even go running , he fucking lied to me .
so confront him .
can' t you ask hank ?
do you want me to ask hank ?
yes .
shit .
i don' t even know .
i don' t know if i wanna know .
hey .
hey .
how was your run ?
great .
lobsters .
fuck you .
mom !
dad !
what' s the matter ?
still wet .
lay down .
i' il be back in a second .
what else , terry ?
what else ?
what ?
relax .
i' il do them as soon as i finish this .
it' s not what you didn' t do , it' s why .
why do we live in the foulest house i know ?
why is it that you say you love our children and they go unbathed for days ?
right now sean is upstairs sleeping in last night' s piss .
i forgot .
goddamn it !
goddamn it , terry .
fucking lazy .
it' s okay , baby .
it' s okay .
stay here and i' il be back .
i' il take the sheets .
it' s just a little bit wet , that' s okay .
it' s okay , honey .
i love you .
go back to sleep .
love you .
all right .
i wanna talk to you .
i' m gonna do the dishes .
no .
now .
talk to me while i' m doing the dishes .
terry ...
sit down .
don' t you take anything .
listen to me .
i am tired of being judged .
who are you to judge me ?
now , i forgot that sean wet his bed ... ... but if you got them up one morning out of every thousand ... ... if you loved them the way you say you do ...
oh , that was shitty .
accusing me of not loving my own children ?
that' s just the way you fight , like a catty , bitchy woman .
and you know what ?
if you ever got them up in the last four or five nights ... ... you would' ve known he hadn' t wet his bed .
come on .
he wet his bed three nights ago and i know that because he told me .
so what ?
so ?
you never get the facts right .
you always get it wrong , terry .
wrong !
you never , ever , ever get it right .
it' s the same thing with the sheets , the bills ...
you always find a way to blow it .
you always have an excuse ... ... and you' re always wrong .
so , what do you want me to do ?
do ?
there' s something you can do ?
you son of a bitch !
terry !
son of a bitch !
you son of a bitch !
goddamn it .
goddamn it , jack .
goddamn it !
oh , fuck .
it was the day after payday , and i gave hank $50 i had owed him .
oh , my god , i can' t believe this .
he paid me !
he made a big deal about not needing the money .
thank you so much .
then , later that night , he fucked my wife in the front seat of my car .
where were you ?
woke up , couldn' t get to sleep , so i went for a walk .
you don' t have to tell me that .
i' ve been up since 1 : 30 .
you' re such a bastard .
did you ever go to sleep ?
yes .
sure you did .
what , i was tired .
yes .
why didn' t you just bring me to bed ?
why didn' t you come to bed ?
because i need to be made love to .
you don' t make love to me anymore .
you fuck me .
i sat on those steps with hank and he held my hand and he listened to me .
he listened to me while i talked about this shitty marriage .
and he told me he felt close to me .
and i was happy when he said it .
and i was happy when i made love to him .
i was so goddamn happy for a minute , and then i thought of you .
i just wanted to be here with you and get us back .
and be in this fucking bed , in this house ... ... with my husband and my kids where i belong .
that' s a really admirable sentiment , terry .
fuck .
jack ... ... right now i love you ... ... maybe more than i have for years .
but i am angry .
i am so fucking angry , jack , way down , because you set this fucking thing up .
you set it up and it happened .
and i don' t know what else is gonna happen .
why ?
you gonna see him again ?
god .
jesus christ , jack .
i don' t know .
what ?
then it' s over .
is that what you' re saying ?
what' s wrong with you ?
think making love is like smoking ?
it' s ...
it' s what ?
it' s a promise .
you promised him you' il see him again .
i didn' t say anything .
opening my legs is a promise .
and he didn' t say anything , either ?
he must have said something .
oh , my god , you like this .
you want details , huh ?
fine .
we drove around for a while .
he put his hand on my tit ... ... and i practically got off just from him touching me .
you know what happened then ?
we parked and we fucked like crazy .
and you know what , jack ?
i came before he did .
and the second time , i was on top .
and i looked in his face , i looked right in his eyes ... ... and i told him i loved him .
that' s enough , all right ?
enough .
you should be knocking my teeth out , but not you , huh ?
not you .
because you like it .
wanna watch us , jack ?
this comes to you ...
fuck who you want , when you want ... ... but don' t give me half assed insights into the soul of a man you have never understood .
your insights suck .
oh , jesus christ .
my " half assed insights .
into the soul of a man i don' t understand .
you poor baby .
oh , my god .
you poor little baby .
you talk and talk .
you think you know yourself , but you know what ?
you' re a pervert .
i' m gonna go to sleep .
we got a couple of kids that are getting up soon .
you' re not known for getting breakfast .
i' il do it .
forget it .
thanks .
it' s one thing you can help with .
unfortunately , you can' t help me with my other problem .
see , jack , i' m not sure what to do .
i mean , tomorrow .
what do i say ?
gee , hank , that was last night ... ... and this is now , and i just don' t know if i wanna fuck anymore .
you gotta admit , even adultery has morality to it .
so i got some things to figure out .
you do what you can .
thanks , jack .
good night .
i' il do what i can .
hello .
they did it last night .

okay .
oh , god .
come on back here !
come on .
take the gold !
get the gold !
he' s gonna hit that guy soon .
which guy ?
the big fat mean guy .
how do you know ?
because if he doesn' t hit him , he won' t feel good about himself .
go to sleep .
tanya , we' il be back at 12 : 30 .
don' t talk to boys .
tanya , can you put two shirts on them ?
they get cold at night .
thanks .

new yorker .

hey .

be careful what you ask for , you just might get it .
so cheers to hank .
hank .
good night .
of course .
terry' s tired .
i' m gonna run her home .
take your car , okay ?
have fun .
enjoyed it .
nice .
he' s giving her a lift home .
among other things .
i think you should tell him now .
i can' t .
why not ?
i don' t know .
why not ?
i don' t know .
don' t .
what ?
i' d like to just concentrate on hating his guts right now .
not this way , not after 10 fucking years .
i just spent the last three hours at willie' s .
you know , the bar all the bag ladies drink in ?
alone in a bar for the first time in my life .
alone in a bar .
what happened ?
never mind what happened .
all right .
that' s why you have strikes against me .
i drink more than any woman we know .
i' m the only woman who keeps up with the men at parties .
i' m drinking in the afternoon .
you' il get rid of me that way .
so ...
yeah .
i drink a lot .
especially on nights when my husband sends me off to fuck his friend .
don' t you wanna stop that , terry ?
give me a reason , jack .
i was ... ... thinking tonight about ...
... when i was 10 , my dad taught me how to fish .
and i was just praying , " please , god , let me catch one fish .
just one , you know ?
as if the luck of catching a fish would make me more lovable .
but then it would follow that to be unlucky is to be unlovable .
and luck isn' t an element in my life now .
it just isn' t .
and for some reason , you hate me for this house of mine ... ... because it' s filthy sometimes .
i don' t hate you , terry .
jack , how would you know if you hated me ?
you don' t even know me .
i know you , terry .
no , you don' t , jack .
i do know you .
no .
you say , " you are what you do " ?
who really believes that ?
i mean , what does that mean ?
does that mean i' m a cook ... ... an errand runner , a fucker , a goddamn cleaning lady ?
because if you , you bastard , lost all discipline and folded up ... ... and turned drunk and got bald and lost everything , i' d love you .
i love you .
you , jack .
but if you love me for what i do instead of for what i am ... ... and there' s a difference , i know there is ... ... then what are you loving when i fuck hank ?
what is it in you that lets me do that ?
or is that just another one of the tricks i do for you ?
screw hank , shake hands , sit , roll over , play dead , fetch ... ... love me like a dog .
i love edith .
what ?
i love edith .
jack .
don' t do this , please .
terry ...
please , please .
terry ...
please .
terry , no !
just take it .
jesus christ .
just take it .
so when are you leaving ?
i don' t know .
maybe you should go today .
why don' t you come to bed ?
i wanna clean my house .
you should see the house .
what' s she doing ?
she' s doing everything .
are you talking to daddy ?
hey , come here .
is it true that you don' t love mom ?
who said that ?
i heard mom last night .
wait a second .
are you getting divorced ?
natasha said you were leaving .
i wanna live with you .
i' m not going to choose .
now , you guys , that' s just mama and daddy fighting at night .
mom says you' re leaving and you love edith and you screwed her .
you know what that means ?
yes .
you do ?
what ?
what what means ?
now listen to me .
listening ?
that' s just adult foolishness , okay ?
understand ?
come here .
let' s go on our bikes .
yeah .

yeah , i do .
uranus , pluto , mercury .
venus , mars , moon .

jupiter .
did you know the universe is so big that nobody can even count how big ...
how many feet it is ?
so people say " googol . " " it' s googol .
see these rocks ?
guess how old they are .
hundred years old ?
nope .
these rocks have been here from the very first cells .
the first cells were the first thing on the earth .
then maybe these rocks were ...
who were the first people on the planet ?
if you believe in god , it' s adam and eve ... ... and if you don' t , apes .
did you know that they just found things that said that god had a wife ?
it' s true .
in real life they did .
what if they don' t believe in god ?
no , i mean , people that look for him thought that .
was it awful ?
was what awful ?
what' s this ?
what are you doing ?
i thought that' s where you went to tell the kids .
unpack it , please .
why ?
couldn' t you tell them ?
i don' t want to .
okay , i' il ... ... call them in and we' il both tell them .
i mean i don' t wanna leave , terry .
jack , i know it' s the kids .
no .
is it just the kids ?
you can see them whenever you want .
i won' t make a big deal out of it .
you know i wouldn' t put us through that .
and if it' s just telling them , we can do it and get it over with .
it' s not the kids , terry .
it' s not the kids .
just unpack my bags , okay ?
we can do this .
it' il be okay .

somebody was mean to her at school .
it' s okay , honey .
it' s okay .
