wake up , wake up , wake up , los angeles .
... last night , police were called to the pier ...
it is 8 : 32 a. m. here in the los angeles area .
and it is hot out there , people .
it' s hotter than a bowl of fuck !
transportation has a lot to do with it .
if america is the great melting pot ...
hey , you' re in my seat . ... then la' s public transportation is the gooey shit baked on the bottom .
don' t get me wrong ,
i' m no snob , just being honest .
i' ve never been one to judge a book by its cover .
unless of course the cover of the book reads ... the guy sitting next to me just shit himself .
but considering 24 hours ago
i was out there with everything , and now i' m in here with nothing ,
i' m in no position to pass judgment .
he seems okay sitting in his own shit .
maybe he knows something i don' t .
the buddha says you achieve total enlightenment when you realize everything in your life is an illusion .
everything !
embracing that kind of thinking definitely make sitting in your own shit more bearable .
i am what i am but a fucker .
and i am what i am ...
one of these guys you see on the 6 : 00 news wakes up , heads off to work , grabs a cup of coffee and goes on a sick rampage .
one of those guys whose friends and neighbors all say ...
who knew ?
he seemed all right to me .
he was the last person you' d ever expect to do something like this .
something in his head must have just snapped .
i just snapped .
that' s too easy .
people see what they want .
and everyone loves a good lie , even me .
call me crazy .
everyone else would .
but they don' t know what i know ... that everything i am is an illusion .
everything !
david !
eh ?
seriously , raise our glasses to david and sara .
may your wedding day be as bright , as beautiful as the two of you .
cheers !
thank you , carl .
thanks .
we just want to thank all of you for really ... for sharing this amazing moment with us .
i know that you have heard the saying that opposites attract .
well , it' s not true .
even though david and i are from very different worlds ,
i know that in our hearts we' re the same person .
and i would like to make a toast and a promise to david .
david , i promise that in our next lifetime together
i will look for you harder and find you sooner .
and i will not waste so much time with all the others .
cheers !
carl .
dave oh !
fucking shit .
what are you doing here ?
the ... the engagement party !
how come you didn' t invite me ?
because i didn' t think you' d come .
i wouldn' t have .
then why are you here ?
' cause you didn' t invite me .
if i know you' re not gonna come
why would i bother sending an invitation ?
an engagement party ? !
what , are you out of your mind ?
i' ve seen you pull some shit from left field , but this takes the cake , man .
could you just act like you' re happy for me ?
no i can' t .
you' re fucking up .
relax , i know what i' m doing .
there' s a reason why i am your oldest friend in the world ...
and i can' t seem to remember what it is right now .
i tell the truth .
remember the truth ?
i' m not like these assholes here .
i' m not gonna pat you on the back and say " mazel tov .
i know what you' re all about , man .
and this isn' t it .
she isn' t it .
shh .
this is not your life , man .
look at you , you can' t even smoke in your own house .
things change , jack .
sometimes , you' ve got to change with them .
okay , look ... there are three things that i know to be true .
love me tender " ... greatest song of all time .
the abominable " doctor phibes , " that is the scariest movie ever made .
and uh ... oh , you' re playing with fire ...
okay , that' s enough , that' s it , what is this ...
hey , honey .
hey , that was awesome .
i remember that .
that was great .
jack , hi , jack , i' m so glad you made it .
i wouldn' t have missed it .
i bet .
you look good .
hey , sara , you redid your bedroom and you didn' t tell me .
isn' t it great ?
uh huh .
hey , david , so are you getting nervous yet ?
no , you ?
i' m just a maid of honor .
i' m not the one taking a bullet .
that' s very funny .
wendy , i' d like you to meet an old friend of mine .
wendy , jack .
jack , say hi to wendy .
hi .
hello .
hey , i wanna show you something real quick .
oh , sweetheart , could you throw another tray of brie puffs in the oven ?

hello , david .

such a beautiful day out there .
i ordered it especially for you .
beautiful day , beautiful lady .
oh ooh , you are the sweetest .
no , i believe that' s your job .
how do you make it look so easy ?
morning , mr. walsh .
morning , ken .
how are you doing ?
good , and i told you to call me david .
how' re you doing ?
super duper , mr ... uh , david .
thanks for showing me the proper cash flow procedures yesterday .
not a problem .
let me know if you have any other questions .
a little late , aren' t you , david ?
not by my watch , kyle .
maybe you want to lose this sundial and get yourself a rolex .
well , as soon as my father in law is president of a bank
i' m gonna ask him to buy me one .
it' s funny .
i' m glad you think so .
hi , kyle .
good morning .
hey , good morning , david .
ah , the lovely martha .
thanks again for catching our transfer mistake .
please , we all make mistakes .
sorry i missed your party last night .
you don' t need to be at a party .
in three weeks you' re a mom .
i know .
i' m starting to get a little nervous .
you' il be fine .
just don' t work too hard .
don' t overdo it .
when you pick something up use your legs .
okay .
oh , hey , how did your big review go ?
no , no , that' s this morning .
oh , it' il go great .
i won' t be surprised if you get employee of the month .
well , i got my fingers crossed .
good luck .
thanks , martha .
good morning .
hey , lady .
hey , how is it going ?
good .
how about you ?
it' s awful .
it' s been the most stressful week of my life .
but as soon as the weekend gets here , i' il be as good as gold .
tell me about it .
you' ve got your meeting with gartin this morning .
you ready ?
well , as ready as i can be .
are you nervous ?
a little bit .
i just hope that my review shows that i' ve been slacking off and this is why i should be fired .
that way when i snap and threaten to kill the old fucker ...
...
i' il have a good reason .
i' m just kidding .
it' s a joke .
joke .
just kidding !
get it ?
anyway , like you said , when the weekend gets here ,
i' il be as good as gold .
well , good luck .
yeah , better get going .
i don' t want to be late .
are we still on for tomorrow ?
absolutely .
i' m buying .
uh , mr. gartin ?
ah , please , come in .
take a seat .
how long have you been with us now ?
next week will be two years , sir .
wow !
you get on the other side of monday , your benefits kick in .
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
you know why you' re here , right ?
my interoffice review .
report card day at the bank .
yeah ...
david !
this bank is only as strong as its weakest link .
that' s one of the reasons i wanted to work here , sir .
it says here you' ve never been late .
and you' ve never left early .
that' s a plus .
well ...
but according to your file you haven' t met your quota this quarter .
really ?
i think that must be a mistake .
you' ve okayed two commercial properties to start building before the leases were finalized .
that' s sloppy work .
those leases were finalized yesterday , sir .
yeah .
i do a pretty good job here , you know .
i give 100 % , 150 % every day .
you can ask anybody .
no need .
i ask my interoffice monitors and they put it in your review .
simple .
you see how it works ?
is it possible that your interoffice monitor might have a personal problem with me ?
is your interoffice monitor kyle ?
be careful .
that idiot son in law of mine has been employee of the month four times in the last two years .
and believe it or not , he deserved it .
my grandfather built this bank on sweat and steel , not bullshit and nepotism .
he put this bank first and i do too .
now today' s thursday .
consider friday your last day .
you' re fired .
that means no bonus , no benefits ?
no shit .
i' il say i was sorry , but i' m not .
look , please , sir , give me a second chance .
i' il work weekends .
sara , my fianc , she quit her job .
i told her i' il take care of her .
i need this , sir .
we' re getting married .
we' re building a nest egg .
that' s great .
good luck to you .
thanks for coming .
i can' t believe you' re gonna do this .
you know this review process that you have ...
i bet it' s illegal .
i could sue you .
go ahead .
you' il lose .
because the best lawyer wins and mine are the best .
they' re ivy league assholes and they' il wrap a lamp cord around a newborn baby' s neck rather than lose to a schmuck like you .
and i' ve got deep pockets and all the time in the world .
and i never lose .
ask anyone who' s tried me .
ask my old man .
by the time i' m done with you you' il be in some alley giving blow jobs to cab drivers for pocket change to get a cup of coffee .
because you' re a loser and that' s what happens to losers .
you' re fired , period .
deal with it .
mr. gartin , ed wheeler , line two .
ed , you old son of a bitch .
how the hell are you ?
what' s the matter , sunshine , stepped in some shit ?
you' re an asshole , kyle .
you think ?
how do you sleep at night ?
usually naked on one of the newer younger employees .
oh , that explains the smile on bob' s face .
go easy on him .
he' s just a janitor .
watch your mouth .
why ?
you' il put that in my review too ?
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
i' m sure you don' t .
i better get back to work .
if you get caught talking to me they might take away your employee of the month paper hat and stupid smile .
i earned that on my own merit .
yeah right .
how did it go ?
oh , it went great , really , really good .
in fact it couldn' t have gone better .
great .
i got fired .
what ? !
that stupid review said that i wasn' t carrying my share of the workload .
so tomorrow is my last day .
i hate to break up the pity party but , wendy , could you give joanie a hand ?
she needs some help closing a transfer .
yeah , i' il be right over .
looking forward to it .
great .
god , i hate that guy !
gives me the creeps .
you are an assistant manager .
is kyle the one who sandbagged me ?
what other asshole would do that ?
what are you gonna tell sara ?
i don' t know .
you know her as well as i do .
you' ve got any advice ?
yeah , if it was my fianc , i would tell her everything .
hello ?
hello ?
hel ...
david , honey , i know it' s you .
i can see it on the caller id .
oh , hey , babe , i' m sorry , i ... sorry about that .
no , i was just looking for a file and i ...
i set the phone down for a second , sorry .
it' s okay .
what' s going on ?
sara ,
i ...
i think i left my house keys in my other jacket .
when you get a chance , could you check and see if they' re there ?
yeah , sure .
listen , before i forget , my parents called and they' re in town and they want to have dinner with us tonight .
i said we' d go to du ays .
how' s that sound ?
yeah , perfect , perfect .
great , what time ?
7 : 30 .
i' il just see you guys there .
oh and listen , sweetheart , could you just not order any alcohol ?
it just makes my dad feel uncomfortable , you know .
it just brings up all that old stuff about my mom , okay ?
not to worry .
so 7 : 30 , du ays .
oh hey , hey , how did the review go ?
well , uh ...
sweetheart , that' s the other line , i gotta go .
i want to hear about it tonight .
okay .
hey ,
i love you .
you believe me ?
i believe you .
bye .
i' m gonna go outside and get some fresh air to clear my head .
not that anybody gives a shit .
i' ve got a three vehicle collision here .
one on fire , repeat , one on fire .
i got ...
i need jaws of life .
we have a truck flipped over .
i got ...
i got pedestrians injured .
it' s a fucking mess .
jackpot !
what ?
yeah , it' s me .
i know .
why are you calling a sleazebag like me ?
isn' t that what your fucking fianc called me ?
what did you expect ?
you ruined our engagement party .
like you' ve never peed in a pool before ?
it was a fountain and it was a gift from her mother .
you know that i have a bladder the size of a chipmunk .
look , what do you need ?
i got fired today .
congratu fucking lations , it' s about time .
i mean , that is a reason to throw a party .
i don' t know how you stood it in there this long .
i mean , i ...
i would have bludgeoned somebody to death with a goddamn have a nice day paperweight after two days in that " stepford wives " freak show bank box in their brooks brothers suits
hey yeah !
dangling people by their balls sucking back mocha lattes , walking around like they are better than the working man like me , whispering behind my back .
who needs that , man ?
they don' t deserve the steam of your piss .
are you smoking crack ?
no , not right now , why ?
do i sound all over the place ?
we' ve got four doas , two more criticals .
fucking a , man , when it rains it pours .
hello ?
yeah , okay .
you got fired , great .
when' s your last day ?
tomorrow .
how did the skank take it when you told her ?
don' t call her a skank .
yeah , but you knew who i was talking about , didn' t you ?
wow , wow !
lady on fire !
we' ve got a lady on fire .
huh ... running just feeds the flames .
all right , look , i gotta go , man .
look , if you wanna continue whining
let' s meet at the schvitz on beverly at 6 : 00 .
now , hang up the phone .
go tell that fuckstick boss of yours to take tomorrow' s workday and shove it up his dick !
i have no idea what that means .
he' il fucking know what it means .
this whole thing reminds me of that big crash up on the grapevine ... schoolbus and girl scouts , car carrier , ba bam !
hey , pretty nasty shit , huh ?
yeah .
some truck blows a light , driver' s tripping his brains out , broadsides a minivan full of old people coming home from church .
fucking hiroshima .
something funny ?
no .
i just ...
i laugh so i don' t cry , you know .
you better start tagging and bagging .
all right .
when your wagon' s full , more to come .
okay .
it reminds me of a couple of summers ago up on the grapevine ... schoolbus and girl scouts .
49 bottles of beer on the wall , they didn' t get to 48 .
i gotta go to work .
10 4 !
hey , ooh !
oh , that' s okay .
i' m not driving .
and it' s not like i' m gonna kill someone , you know .

today , jethro .
before any more of your teeth fall out .
you banjo strumming deliverance reject .

i' m thinking about getting engaged .
oh , yeah ?

she told me to give you this .
freak , fucker !
where are you going ?
see that girl on the back of big pumpkins ?
i' m gonna comb her hair , make her look real pretty .
yeah , that' s not creepy at all .
i' m sorry , mrs. crabtree , but the bank won' t approve it .
how can they not approve my loan ?
i' ve never missed a payment in my life , mr. walsh .
unfortunately , your husband' s bad credit makes you a loan risk .
and this bank' s policy states that the spouse of the deceased is responsible for the payments of the loan .
now , off the record ,
i think that policy is s h i t.
i tell you what , mrs. crabtree ,
i' il download your files again and see if i can come up with some way to get around it .
oh , i really appreciate this , mr. walsh .
what' s wrong with your face ?
jacob .
i got burned .
did it hurt ?
you bet it did .
that' s what happens when you play with matches , jacob .
i can' t thank you enough for this , mr. walsh .
thanks , mister .
no problem .
i tell you what , martha , there is part of this job i am not gonna miss .
how can you help that woman ?
tomorrow is your last day .
i' il think of something .
hey , david .
you wanna grab a drink later and talk about all this ?
that' s really sweet , wendy , but grabbing a drink didn' t make my list of things to do for tonight .
okay ?
thanks though .
am i on the list for tomorrow ?
i' m sorry , yeah .
when was the last time you flossed ?
like a month ago .
was it a month ago or like a month ago ?
huh ... like a month ago .
all right , next time you come to the office we' il do a cap and clean .
when can you do that ?
as soon as you get your license back .
they took away my license , not my abilities as a dentist .
that' s just a piece of paper .
' cause you know , i was looking at those x rays , and you need a root canal very seriously .
you want ...
yeah .
you mind keeping it down ?
i don' t want the entire world to know that i' ve got a dental plan with an unlicensed dentist .
hell , god !
marianne , hey , good luck with the back acne .
hey , woo ooh !
is it hot here or is it just me ?
you know we' ve got lockers here .
you could ...
yeah and you know what else they have ?
thieves .
say , d' you think i' m freeballing it on these meat slabs after half of la' s open ass cracks have been sitting in here self basting ?
not on my clock , neat freak .
hi , you' re writing a book about my cock ?
if not , you wanna quit with your eyeballing , boitano .
don' t start , please .
you' re an asshole .
yes and i' m sure that' s all i' il ever be to you .
guys are touchier than chicks .
jack , you know eric' s gay .
yeah , he is here , he' s queer .
i' m used to it .
i have no problem with queers .
well , the community is gonna be so thrilled to hear that , jack .
i mean it .
i mean , sucking dicks when chicks do it , i not only applaud , i wanna watch it .
i got ...
i got three hour pornos with nothing but wall to wall balls to jaws .
but when i think about chowing down on some other guy' s wrinkled mr. lincoln ...
jack , are you a cartoon character ?
i mean , does someone come to your house every morning and draw you on an easel ?
don' t encourage him .
is that how ?
explain this to me ...
don' t encourage him ...
i ...
hey , sleek .
i got you a watch .
wow !
this is nice .
do you get it from me ?
get what ?
exactly !
here' s to unemployment !
you' re done tomorrow , eh ?
iceman' s a cracker .
that is not a lot of notice .
i was planning on telling sara tonight .
her parents came to town .
we' re having dinner .
agh .
not exactly the best time to tell her i' m out of a job .
what ?
that' s the perfect time !
out in public with her parents ?
you couldn' t have planned that better , man .
wow !
when you tell her , she' s gonna snap and want to get all up in your shit .
but she won' t be able to .
she' il implode , man !
i say , light the fuse , step back and watch the fireworks .
fuck , i wish i could see that .
hey , how many of those have you had ?
wha ... wait , wait ,
you might want to think about cutting back .
he sucks dicks , you ribbing me about a few beers ?
okay , that' s it , all right ?
that' s enough , i have to go .
sorry , gotta go .
i just cannot sit here listening to this putdown man any longer .
as much as i would love to stay ,
i just ... you know i think i need to go and get something in my stomach .
yeah , i bet with all this ball talk you' ve worked up quite an appetite .
ass face !
hell .
oh , just remember what we talked about , all right ?
i' ve got your x rays and you can pay me when you can pay me , all right ?
good luck tomorrow .
thanks .
you wanna talk about this whole sara bank situation ?
no , i just want to relax .
you' ve ever watched figure skating , man ?
please , don' t talk .
i' ve got a lot on my mind
i mean i didn' t do the sushi , but michelle kwan ...
what are you doing ?
can' t we just sit here and not talk ?
could we do that ?
let' s try and do that .
i' d suck sake out of her ass in front of my grandmother .
reverend goodwin , good to see you , sir .
how are you ?
i' m doing all right .
wonderful .
mrs. goodwin , you look lovely as usual .
thank you , david .
hi , babe .
hi , david .
excuse me , could we get somebody over here to clear this table for us , please ?
absolutely , one minute .
i was excited to hear that you were in town .
how long are you gonna be here ?
through the weekend .
the weekend ... right .
where are you staying ?
at the house .
at the house ?
yeah , i thought that they would take our bed and i would sleep on the couch .
that won' t be enough room for both of us on that couch .
that' s what i' d like to talk to you about , david .
okay .
here you go , sir .
thank you , paulo .
thank you , sir , have a wonderful evening .
thank you .
did you guys already eat ?
yeah , we had reservation for 6 : 00 .
oh , i' m sorry , sweetheart , i thought you said 7 : 30 .
i did .
david , we have to talk .
okay , there are a few things that i need to say to you .
do you mind if we do it after your parents leave ?
i mean , they drove all day , they' ve already eaten .
no point of their sticking around while the two of us yam it up .
baby ...
am i missing something here ?
sara has something to tell you .
go ahead , sara , read the letter .
what letter ?
this letter .
because i get so emotional when i talk about my feelings , my parents suggested that i put my feelings down on paper .
dear david ,
when i first met you , i felt like all my prayers had been answered .
you showed up in my life at a time when i really needed someone .
it was as if the lord our savior himself parted the clouds , placed us together .
you are my knight in shining armor .
sexually , you spread me open in a way that had been closed for so long .
you' re sure you can' t wait till later for this ?
read your letter , darling .
when you asked me to marry you , my world was complete .
from our first night together , all i could think about was making love to you .
here , sweetie .
thank you , mom .
i' d be walking down the aisle of a grocery store , and just start fantasizing about making love , always waiting for the next time that you would be inside of me .
but all of that changed in one moment .
that' s fine , that' s fine .
so you' re here for the weekend ?
that' s great .
uh ... who wants dessert ?
dessert would be good .
uh , can we smoke in here ?
david , i found these in your jacket' s pocket and they' re not mine .
are you sure ?
they look ... they look like yours .
you know good and damn well they' re not mine .
i don' t like anything riding up my ass .
well , we know they' re not mine .
whose are they , david ?
who is she ?
you don' t honestly think that i ...
look , sara ... we' il talk about this later .
but i am not gonna sit here , in this restaurant and have this absurd conversation after the day i' ve had .
not to change the subject or anything , but i was fired today .
oh , poor you .
what a big fucking surprise .
you evil little prick .
i' m sure you deserved it .
can i have a vodka tonic ?
absolutely .
thanks .
lime ?
please .
what ?
she is the one with the booze jones .
david .
look , sara , can we talk about this later ?
no , we can' t just discuss this , david , because everything that you said is a lie .
everything !
that' s not true .
i really thought that you were different , david .
but you' re not .
you' re not .
you' re just a lying piece of shit .
and i never , ever , want to see your face again .
women !
you can lie to sara .
and you can lie to me .
but you can' t lie to him .
he sees everything .
may you burn in hell for what you' ve done to my daughter .
if i were a man of the cloth , i' d torch you in your bed while you sleep .
here we go , sir .
thank you .
sir ?
take it .
where are you ?
thomas jefferson , monticello , little mountain .
god damn it !
god damn it !
let' s go , man , " i' m tired of this .
chicken , wait !
chicken !
wait , wait .
wait !
i' il see your 50 and i raise you 50 .
you' re on .
all right
what tv show broke ground by having a mongoloid in the lead role ?
life goes on , " corky thatcher .
your retard with a dream .
fuck !
fuck , man , fuck !
what , you' ve been watching " mexican jeopardy " ?
hey , we' re guatemalans , homie , guatemalans .
yeah , chicken , there' s a difference .
when are you gonna learn , otto ?
huh ?
can' t you see this dumbfuck ruben is like a walking encyclopedia of useless knowledge ?
huh ?
i make money with this guy everywhere i go .
you' re too easy , doc .
man , hey , by the way , you still owe us big cash .
don' t keep us waiting , we hate that .
all right ?
ciudate , cabron !
yeah , you know where you can find me .
vaya con dios , fagamos .
so you got family here ?
my mom .
she' s in chowchilla prison up north .
ah .
when i was eight , she stabbed my dad with a butcher knife .
wow !
she caught him in the basement going down on the babysitter .
uh oh !
it was christmas eve 1982 .
blood was all over the tree and the presents .
just totally ruined everything .
oh , boy !
she stabbed him 43 times .
almost all in the face .
oh , ouch !
he died when i was 16 .
he had prostate cancer .
you know , up in his butt ?
sorry about that .
my mom said that the cancer was his karma for diddling our babysitter .
she was 14 .
you know , i think it was worse because she was his niece , my cousin darlene .
darlene ?
it' s not like he raped her or anything .
i mean , she was high like 24/ 7 .
plus she probably sucked off half the dads in bakersfield .
yeah , probably .
i mean , it' s strange because i love my dad .
but i seriously think it' s fucked up the way i interact with men .
so you' re dating anyone ?
you wanna go again ?
it gets better .
better than a christmas homicide with a kitchen knife ?
i don' t think so .
eh , eh , here ... here' s a tip for a good girl .
oh , my god , it' s gorgeous .
yeah , right here .
now , run along to recess .
ow !
holy shit !
you made it .
my god , the fart locker on that little princess is killing me .
sara found one of wendy' s thongs in my jacket pocket .
oh , that' s beautiful .
was it ugly ?
it' s over .
the wedding' s off .
you have had the perfect bad day .
you should have seen the look on her face .
she was really hurt .
of course , she' s hurt , dr. jekyil .
mr. hyde' s been power spanking the blonde from the bank .
wendy doesn' t mean anything to me .
yet sara does ?
why is it so impossible for you to realize that i might be in love ?
because , uh ... love is like bigfoot .
it' s a myth people like to believe in .
it turns out to be bullshit when held up to scientific scrutiny .
this gonna be one of your long ones ?
love is a con women came up with trying to explain the chemical reaction in men' s brains that make us physiologically unable to stay with them forever .
men and women' s brains are different .
perfect example ...
i' m banging a chick ,
i deliver the payload .
that' s all right .
what happens ?
roll over and fall asleep .
why ?
bourbon and quaaludes ?
wrong .
see , man' s brain shoots him a natural tranquilizer when he gets off .
tryptophan .
sedative .
you can' t help but roll over and fall asleep .
chicks hate us for it anyway , because they' re the exact opposite .
when they come ...
shh .
they wanna chit chat , cuddle .
feng shui the goddamn living room , why ?
oxytocin .
oxytocin ?
oxytocin .
it' s a bonding chemical .
it' s a natural stimulant .
gets them high as a japanese kite .
you know what the fucked up part is ?
the longer they stay with the same guy , the more secure they feel .
the more secure , the more the brain squirts .
the more the brain squirts , the more of a habit they have .
it' s nature' s way of getting chicks hooked on their own snatch smack .
when did hustler add a science section ?
love is just a chick' s menstrual hallucination brought on by tragic side effects from natural selection .
ant that is why you are not now , nor will you ever be in love .
it' s bigfoot .
bigfoot , uh ?
thanks , i' il keep it in mind .
dude .
hey , i take my hat off to you .
you' re a big picture guy .
there' s no doubt about that .
i mean , you get the bank job .
you move to galleriaville .
you get the house , the suit , the slick car .
the beauty of an angle .
it' s total bullshit .
it' s still beautiful .
i guess it' s just , just one glitch ... you just had to have a full time broad .
i mean , wake up , man .
you are not in love with sara .
will you stop fucking saying that ?
stop fucking wendy .
you think about it .
you wanted her to find that thong , so that she' d break up with you before you had to break up with her .
you' re just pissed off because you know that everything i say is true .
it was at first .
yeah .
the day sara moved in , i wondered how long it' d be until i moved out .
i didn' t give us a month .
living the same deal over and over again , that' s not me .
i can' t just fuck one girl .
so i screwed wendy right in queue .
first time in my life i feel guilty about it .
i' m in love with sara .
dude , you are all over the place .
i don' t know if you' re lying to me , yourself , or the both of us .
god !
i' ve never felt anything close to this good .
one morning , i woke up and she' s lying there next to me smiling , watching me while i sleep .
and it hit me .
it' s not the house , the money , the job .
it' s me .
she loves me .
how much of her kool aid did you drink ?
do you think she would look twice at you and that fucked up face if you were flipping jumbo jacks ?
oh eh , who' s the hot guy with the burn scars working the french fry machine ?
give me a break , man .
oh yeah , did you forget about the freak show , uh ?
right here .
forget about that ?
huh ?
you have no idea who i am .
god !
okay ,
hey , let' s say you patch everything up , okay ?
she forgives you .
forget about wendy , forget about me , forget about the bank bullshit , forget everything , okay ?
it' s just you and her and everything is right in fucking whoville .
if you marry her and you don' t dance exactly the tune she' s playing , she will trade you in for a better model .
trust me .
you fucked her before she could fuck you .
you did what you had to do .
it' s over .
god !
accept the fact that you are dead to her .
promise me that you will not go home .
i couldn' t , even if i wanted to .
dude .
all right , look , just get a room at the paradise , a 12 pack , call it a night .
tomorrow morning , you' re gonna get up , you' re gonna walk into that ass wipe bank , take your pay .
tomorrow night you and i will be celebrating .
you' il have your life back again .
is that what you call what you' ve got ?
you just gave a dead woman' s bracelet to an 18 year old stripper who' s gonna fuck you in the parking lot while you snort crank off a hunting knife .
and your point is ?
do not go home !
out of my office ...
what are you looking at ?
yeah , pretend like you didn' t hear us , buddy .
excuse me ?
excuse me ? " i' il fucking excuse you .
excuse my foot up your ass .
david , i promise that in our next lifetime together that i will look for you harder and find you sooner and i will not waste so much time with all the others .
uh ?
how is it going ?
good .
you ?
okay , i guess .
good .
now that we' ve got that out of the way , what can i do for you ?
jack thought you might like some company .
he did , huh ?
how thoughtful .
i' m whisper .
hi , i' m david .
i' m already paid for and i' m really clean .
aren' t we all ?
and she and her mom storm out of the restaurant
leaving me sitting there with her dad .
what a nightmare !
you' re having a bad day .
i can' t believe her parents were there when she did that .
that' s so weird .
it is , isn' t it ?
do you want a blow job or something ?
i' m good , thanks .
do you wanna fuck ?
that' s really sweet , but i don' t think it' s a good idea .
you can jerk off on my tits if you want .
you know , as much as i' d love to ,
i think i' m gonna pass .
whisper ?
do you have a boyfriend ?
yeah .
what would you do if you ... what would you do if he was having sex with another girl ?
play with her tits ?
and you' re not there .
oh .
yeah , you found out that he was cheating on you with another woman .
would you want him to explain to you why he did it ?
or would you ... would you even care ?
well , is he in love with the girl ?
does it matter ?
i think so .
i mean , i' d rather my boyfriend fuck some girl behind my back and be in love with me because if he' s fucking me and is in love with her , then that' s almost worse .
fucking is something you do , but loving is something you feel .
to me , that' s totally different .
know what i mean ?
yeah .
what' s your boyfriend' s name ?
dennis trent .
so he has two first names .
so ?
it was just an observation .
are you in love with dennis trent ?
absolutely .
are you in love with sara ?
yeah , i think i am .
so how' d you get burned ?
i was about 16 years old and i was ...
i was helping a buddy of mine siphon gas out of my old man' s car .
and he put the hose in too far , the gasoline shot up into his mouth and he spit it out all over me .
and i' m standing there with a cigarette in one hand and a gas can in the other .
me and that car went up like that .
woke up the whole neighborhood .
next thing you know , my old man comes running out of the house screaming .
oh , my god !
your poor dad .
poor dad !
yeah , he beat my ass until the ambulance came .
yeah .
that was the last time i saw him .
by the time i got out of the hospital i was almost 18 years old .
so you didn' t finish high school ?
i didn' t finish much of anything for about 10 years or so .
i just floated through life pissed off at the world , just getting by , getting high , just making it up as i went .
and then one day ,
i saw this guy walking down the street in the sharpest suit i' d ever seen .
this guy was going somewhere , you know .
and i thought to myself what does he do for a living ?
i bet he' s got a great job , he' s got a nice car , a beautiful wife , nice house .
and i remembered something my mom told me .
she said " choose your destiny .
decide what you want to be in life and start being it .
and so i figured if i could look like that guy , if i could act like that guy , then maybe i could become that guy and get everything i ever wanted .
so i bought the suit and i made up this resume and i walked into north & wells bank and basically lied my way into a job .
and it worked .
and in less than two years , i had the car .
i had the house .
i had it all .
i had become that guy i had seen walking down the street .
so you did it ?
yeah , i did it .
but i always knew in the back of my mind ... that it wouldn' t last , because i' m not that guy .
and if i was that guy ,
i was just pretending to be that guy .
i' m the guy with the fucked up face .
that' s who i am .
you must really hate the guy that spit the gas on you .
you' re damn right i do .
but he' s the only guy that came to visit me when i was in the hospital .
what' s he doing now ?
there' s no telling .
yeah !
otto !
oh !
yeah !
what the ...
leave us alone this fucking time !
ow !
man , what are you doing here ?
she ain' t got no hair down there at all , does she ?
she' s all smooth like a fucking candy .
man , you' re scaring the poor girl .
please .
sorry .
didn' t mean to scare you .
yeah , i bet you say that to all the girls just before you throw their lifeless bodies into the lake .
will you ...
otto ?
what do you want ?
dead man derby .
dead man derby .
you want to make some fucking money tonight or what ?
are you kidding me ?
this sills guy' s got brain cancer .
he' s got a metal tube poked in his head .
in his fucking head , man .
i' il give you jimmy riggs .
i' il throw in sills .
that' s a two to one shot .
puking up blood like he' s old faithful .
he ain' t going to make it , so place your fucking bets .
bet money on terminal cases ?
even manson would call bullshit on this freak show !
get out of here !
god !
free country .
love it or leave it .
freak !
hello ?
hey .
david , it' s late .
what do you want ?
i just want to apologize .
i fucked up .
is that it ?
i just want you to know , if i never see you again ... that every time i said i loved you ...
i meant it .
i' ve got to go .
david , don' t hang up .
david .
why is he doing this ?
you asshole .
how dare you call me and give me that shit and then hang up ?
oh good .
good , you' ve got a gun .
i' m sorry , sara .
i really do love you ...
do not say you love me , david .
don' t !
okay ?
hell , you disgust me .
because i loved you , david .
i did .
i don' t know why i did , but yeah , i did .
so what , you had a shitty fucking day ?
guess what ?
so did i !
today i found out that my fianc was fucking my maid of honor !
did you want to fuck wendy last night at our engagement party ?
huh ?
did you want to fuck her on our bed ?
would that turn you on ?
how did you know it was wendy ?
come on .
you' d have to be blind not to know what was going on .
i know everything .
i messed up .
yeah , you did .
you don' t even know how bad .
what do you want me to say ?
did you think i wouldn' t find out ?
did you think i' m that fucking stupid ?
i never thought you were stupid .
if you want to sit in this room and put a gun in your mouth and get all dramatic , go ahead .
you and i both know you won' t kill yourself .
you know what ?
i don' t feel sorry for you or feel guilty about your feelings , because i fucking hate you .
i fucking hate you for what you' ve done to me !
you believe me ?
i hope you get what you deserve .
hello ?
hey .
where are you ?
right now i' m just sitting in my car .
why ?
well , for what it' s worth , she knows about us .
she knows it was you .
dear sara ...
oh no , she took my goddamn car .
whisper , i guess you fucked me after all .
every day , some faceless knob walks out in front of a bus and buys it .
they call it fate , god' s will .
that particular john doe spent his whole life eating his peas , studying his algebra , saving for his 401k , blah blah blah .
all that to wind up a brown stain on the windshield of a 10 ton city bus , to be remembered as the poor schmuck that got hit by a bus .
god kills true believers and kind souls every day and gets a free pass from the entire world , all because people think his murder and mayhem is part of some divine plan .
well , fuck that !
i' ve got a divine plan and it' s just as good as god' s .
nobody has the first clue why god wastes people .
but today , everyone is going to know why i did .
good morning , david .
not really , hank .
i' ve seen better .
hi , dave .
good morning , david .
mrs. chapman .
could i talk to you for a second ?
of course , david .
i always have time for a sweet young man like you .
dial it down on the makeup a bit .
when you sweat , you look like a cheap , nasty whore .
freaks us out !
have a good one !
morning , dave .
how are you doing today ?
i' m hanging over the abyss by a fucking thread , kenny .
but other than that , everything is super duper !
rough night , david ?
go home , martha .
what ?
go home .
you' re nine months pregnant , for god' s sake .
it' s bullshit that they won' t give you time off .
i' d really love to , but i don' t want to lose my job .
the safety of your job or the safety of your unborn child ?
interesting question to ponder .
let me see if i can help you with this one .
your water pops , you snap into a quick fit of labor and pass out , falling on your stomach , crushing your child right here in this break room with nobody around !
you' il be lying here like a goddamn squash .
listen to me , martha .
you really don' t need to be here .
go home .
nice suit .
it' s a good look for you .
how come i can' t access my files ?
well ... only bank employees can access bank files .
judy !
conference room , now !
marilyn , excuse me .
quick question for you .
think about it ,
' cause how grateful would you be if this was your desk ?
oh , uh .
i know what you' re saying .
all right .
good morning , mrs. crabtree .
that' s not good .
there was an old woman who lived in a shoe .
she had so much money ...
she didn' t know what to do .
thank you for banking at north & wells .
have a nice life .
hey .
have you seen david this morning ?
yeah .
he looks awful .
he was acting really weird , too .
what do you mean ?
where is he ?
i don' t know .
it was scary .
what in the hell is going on in here ? !
bill !
good of you to drop by .
i was just pissing on your grandfather .
please come in .
have a seat .
i don' t want to cause a scene .
tits on a taco .
it' s hot out there .
my grandmother ... she loved the heat of summer .
i personally don' t care much for it .
and i fucking hated her .
don' t get me going .
give me a cool breeze , a nip in the air , a hot cup of cocoa , and i' m happy as a dog licking a nut .
you know my first name ?
huh ?
it' s charles .
charles david walsh .
but you know what ?
why don' t you call me chuck ?
allen' s your first name , right ?
but why don' t i go ahead and call you al ?
i' ve been working here for two years , and you don' t even know my first name .
am i supposed to be scared ?
let me finish !
don' t be rude !
i sat here yesterday and listened to all the bullshit dribbling out of your fucking pie hole !
so , come on !
give a girl a break .
where was i ?
oh yeah !
names .
lee harvey oswald , james earl ray , john wilkes booth .
what do they all have in common , al ?
two things .
they all killed people .
and they all went by their full name .
mark david chapman shot john lennon right outside his front door .
no yoko .
john .
tell me the world' s a fair place .
it' s not .
and try to remember that while your ass bleeds as you' re being passed from nigger to wop in the showers at san quentin .
go on .
you don' t have the balls .
you know , you' re dancing on my last nerve , and i hate dancing .
you sure i don' t have the balls , i' m a loser and i don' t have what it takes ?
all i got to do is pull the trigger and blow the brains out of the back of your fucking head !
simple .
see how that works ?
you' re ready to be the weakest link in this bank chain .
you' re dead .
period .
deal with it !
just like i said , a gutless loser .
gartin and i agree on one thing ...
life isn' t fair .
if it was , he' d be dead .
some people would say it wasn' t his time , that i was here with a gun for some other reason , that i was the instrument of some greater good .
you want to believe that ?
be my guest .
i say the only cosmic truth proven by this fucked up trip is , just when you think things can' t get any weirder , they do .
i' m not gonna say it again !
everyone on the floor now !
i' m not gonna say it again !
everyone on the floor now !

make it look like you like each other .
oh , that' s ...
we have confirmation from the lab on david' s remains , ms. goodwin .
it' s a positive id .
i hate to be so forward , but i have a couple more questions .
no , i understand .
so he never came home from the motel after the last night , right ?
yes , um ...
i left him at the hotel around 3 : 00 in the morning .
was he drinking or ... ?
no .
did he give you any indication that he intended to ...
i broke off our engagement .
i didn' t know that he had gotten fired that day .
i guess it just ... it was just too much for him to handle .
call us if you need anything , okay ?
he saved the life of a fellow bank employee .
those of us that knew david ... it' s just ... you would never ever expect him to do something like this .
and we don' t really know what happened , but i do know that he saved lives today .
metro police received a major break in the case when firefighters responding to a blaze at this chemical storage warehouse in west covina discovered a burned out van .
at this hour , the la county medical examiner has positively identified the human remains discovered in that vehicle as those of unlikely hero charles david walsh .
while a massive investiga ...
what the fuck !
this is ...
i can' t believe this .
this is ... every station ...
it' s hero , hero , hero .
there' s nothing about the robbery .
this is such bullshit .
you' ve been harping on that for three days .
when are you gonna quit bitching ?
two years you' ve been busting my balls on every detail of this plan .
and everything i said would happen happened ... right down to that stupid newswoman calling me a hero .
and i wrapped it up with a nice bow for the cops too .
i' m dead , you' re invisible .
we got $9 million and nobody' s even looking for us .
so for the last time , shut the fuck up .
and so say all of us .
you know what ?
i' ve had enough of your shit too .
i' ve had it with both of you .
finish loading your shit and get out .
you need to keep it down .
i can hear you in the other room .
why don' t you put it in my bank review ?
oh , well , maybe i will .
ah , not so hard .
i' m still sore .
that' s bullshit , honey .
i thought bulletproof vests were supposed to be bulletproof .
why didn' t you use blanks ?
that' s what i told him .
here .
we all got to relax , pack up and go our separate ways .
oh , chicken does such good work .
i look so thin .
hey , jack ?
yes , eric .
is chicken still breathing ?
uh , chicken , are you still breathing ?
not anymore .
i liked him .
why did you kill him ?
it was part of the plan .
you knew that .
mm hmm , well , thanks for thinking of me .
if you need anymore dental work done in the future ...
hey , " crying game , " a root canal is dental work .
all you did was x ray the teeth of a corpse .
well , jack , let' s review what i did .
i provided the police with fake dental records for our hero that matched the poor schmuck we burnt up in the van .
the van that i drove .
and , i feigned mental retardation .
oh , no , that was you , wasn' t it ?
oh , god , you were feigning , weren' t you ?
i' m sorry , i didn' t know .
i had no idea .
oh , nice bag .
oh , that ?
oh , thanks , that was a gift .
so where are you headed , miss thang ?
oh , well , uh ... my office is still closed today so i thought i would go over there and stash my winnings .
aah .
this is the part i hate , the goodbyes .
oh , i feel just like dorothy leaving oz .
you know , i' m gonna miss you the most , scarecrow .
all right .
you take care of yourself , okay ?
i will .
you do the same .
right .
oh , uh ...
jack !
i' m thinking of a number between one and 10 .
uh ... six .
oh , so close .
it was go fuck yourself .
thank you , my lady .
god !
well , i gotta get going .
i gotta get back to my place , take a shower .
we reopen today and i have to see a grief counselor .
let' s go through this one more time , make sure we' re all on the same page .
so you' re gonna go back to work for two more months , and then ...
right , um ...
i just ...
i can' t work here anymore .
i need to get away .
i need to ... just go someplace else .
i' ve had nightmares every night since the robbery .
and i just want to put this all behind me .
i just want to start a new life .
something like that .
that' s good .
she' s good .
she' s great .
all right .
well , listen , i won' t see you guys for a while , so ... try to stay out of trouble .
and jack , will you keep an eye on him for me ?
i will .
okay .
hey , i don' t want to get all sappy and shit .
but you did a good job .
thanks , jack .
uh , my real name is wyatt , so you can call me that .
okay .
thanks , wyatt .
hey , take care of yourself , sweetheart .

i' il see you when i see you .
yeah .
god damn !
the ass on that girl .
you know i hate to see her go , but i love to watch her leave .
let' s split up her share and get the fuck out of here .
we got a plane to catch .
you have ice cold piss running through your veins .
what ... how can you walk away from a woman like that ?
easily .
all right , big time , i' m gonna pull my car around .
you finish packing here .
something wrong ?
we did it .
you and me , man , we pulled it off .
fucking a !
listen , i' m sorry about freaking out there toward the end .
you know , i hate to admit it , but you were right .
i got caught up .
i thought i was in love .
whatever .
here .
fuck sara , and fuck wendy !
i couldn' t have done it without you .
hey .
thanks , wyatt .
you were a little stupid there for a while .

i mean , i feel like ... fuck !
you' re the only real friend i' ve got ...
oh ... now you' re quiet .

no big speech about how you didn' t see this coming ?
you burned me .

well , the sooner we get out of here , the better .
hey , wyatt , how is it hanging ?
how much do you think housekeeping gets to clean a room like this ?

i guess i should be disappointed with the way things turned out .
but what' re you gonna do ?
if you want to play the game and someone plays it better than you , you' ve got to give it up to them .
live and learn .
or not .
at least now i know that everything in my life was an illusion .
i just didn' t know how deep it ran .
the good news is ,
i guess i finally achieved total enlightenment .
the bad news ?
i had to take a bullet in the brain to get it .
as for fate and cosmic justice ?
well , maybe in the end we do get exactly what we deserve .
maybe god does have a divine plan .
if he does , good luck trying to figure it out .
i guess buddha had it figured right .
life is the biggest con of them all .
just when you think you got every angle figured , every one played , the truth is revealed .
and the truth is , everything you thought you knew was an illusion .
everything .
i hate going to the dentist .
i' ve missed you .
believe me ?
i believe you .
