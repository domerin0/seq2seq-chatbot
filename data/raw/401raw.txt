news has come from vienna !
leopold of austria has seized king richard on his return from the crusades .
our king is being held prisoner .
nothing further is known .
his highness prince john will make further public pronouncement tomorrow .
and how are the dear saxons taking the news , sir guy ?
they' re even more worried than longchamps , your highness .
they' il be more than worried when i squeeze the fat out of their pampered hides .
you intend to act on your plans ?
what better moment than this , sir guy ?
whoever would have thought my dear brother would be so considerate as to get captured ... ... and leave all of england to my tender care ?
he may disapprove when he returns , your highness .
lf he returns .
and i' il see to it that he doesn' t .
we must drink to this moment , sir guy .
golden days are ahead .
i' il assign tax districts to you tomorrow .
tomorrow , your highness .
but who' s gonna pay me ?
pay !
pay !
that' s all you saxons think about .
didn' t i tell you it was for prince john , who' s just come up from london ?
stop !
stop !
this man is freeborn !
he' s a landowner .
you can' t make a slave of him !
didn' t he refuse to send his men to work in guy of gisbourne' s field ?
but i protest !
dickon , follow me !
the rest remain here .
what' s your name , you saxon dog ?
a better one than yours .
look to your manners !
this is sir guy of gisbourne .
sir guy or the devil !
there' s little to choose between them .
what' s your name ?
much , the miller' s son .
you know it' s death to kill the king' s deer ?
and death from hunger if i don' t .
thanks to you and the rest of you norman cutthroats at nottingham castle .
be quiet , you .
i won' t be quiet !
you can kill me if you like , but not until i' ve had my say .
you can beat and starve us saxons now ... ... but when king richard escapes , he' il take you by the scruff of the neck ... ... and fling you into the sea !
what the devil ?
come now , sir guy .
you' d not kill a man for telling the truth ?
lf it amused me , yes .
be thankful my humor' s of a different sort .
by what right do you interfere with justice ?
by a better right than you have to misuse it .
that goes for your master , prince john .
i' il give him that message at the baron' s meeting in nottingham tonight .
thank you .
he does need a bit of a talking to .
eh , will ?
yes , he has been getting rather out of hand .
fetch him along .
hold there .
what' s his fault ?
he' s killed a royal deer .
you' re wrong .
i killed that deer .
this man' s my servant .
i suppose you realize the penalty for killing the king' s deer is death .
whether for serf or noble .
really ?
are there no exceptions ?
thanks , good master .
better look before you shoot next time .
from this day , i follow only you .
there isn' t a poor saxon in nottingham shire ... ... that doesn' t know and bless sir robin of locksley .
take me as your servant .
why , in all the forest , there isn' t a hunter as good as me .
i ask no pay .
just to follow you .
fetch the deer , then .
while richard is bent on adventure in foreign lands ... ... it is our duty as normans to preserve the realm ... ... by giving loyal support to prince john , the only true defender of the norman spirit .
hail to prince john .
my lords , i thank you .
good food , good company , and a beautiful woman to flatter me , eh , lady marian ?
was it worthwhile coming with me from london ... ... to see what stout fellows our nottingham friends are ?
take sir guy of gisbourne , now .
one of our most renowned defenders of the realm .
must i take him , your highness ?
why , you like him , don' t you ?
well , he' s a norman , of course .
ls that the only reason for liking him ?
lsn' t that reason enough for a royal ward who must obey her guardian ?
oh , nay , i' d not force you , my lady .
but he' s our most powerful friend in these shires and he' s already in love with you .
lf i could promise him marriage to a royal ward , it might help my plans .
perhaps when i know him better .
of course .
you' re a very wise young woman .
any more objections to the new tax from our saxon friends ?
objections , your highness ?
with a saxon dangling from every gallows tree between here and charnwood ?
well said , sir knight .
but not too many , mind .
else we' il have nobody left to till our land or pay the tax .
there' s one exception i' d make , your highness .
a certain saxon noble .
who is that ?
sir robin of locksley .
sir rob sir robin of locksley ?
why , i' ve heard precious little else since i' ve been here .
what' s his latest outrage ?
oh , nothing less than killing a royal deer in sherwood forest today .
and you didn' t take him ?
that would have been a problem , your highness .
a saxon a problem ?
he' s a notorious troublemaker , my lady .
aye .
an impudent , reckless rogue ... ... who goes around the shire stirring up the saxons against authority .
and he has the insolence to set himself up as a protector of the people .
i could have captured him long ago , but ....
but what ?
well , he' s the deadliest archer in england , and ....
and my brave high sheriff of nottingham is afraid of him .
i want him taken and hanged .
at once , do you hear ?
i' il not tolerate
open the door !
who is this , this ... ?
sir robin of locksley , your highness .
let him approach .
greetings , your highness .
you should teach gisbourne hospitality .
i no sooner enter his castle doors with a piece of meat ... ... than his starving servants try to snatch it from me .
you should feed them , gisbourne .
they' il work better .
with the compliments of your royal brother , king richard , god bless him !
by my faith , but you' re a bold rascal .
robin , i like you .
i' m gratified , your highness .
i don' t think gisbourne shares that sentiment , however .
he does look sour .
what' s the matter , gisbourne ?
run out of hangings ?
i know a ripe subject for one .
lf you' il excuse me
sit down !
sit down , my dear .
he' il not harm you .
sir robin , this is the lady marian fitzwalter .
i hope my lady had a pleasant journey from london ?
what you hope can hardly be important .
what a pity her manners don' t match her looks , your highness .
you hear that , gentlemen ?
here' s gisbourne so in love with marian he daren' t say " boo " to her ... ... and this saucy fellow gives her better than she sends .
my lords and ladies , i would like to present to you sir robin of locksley .
sir robin , permit me to present to you your host , sir guy of gisbourne ...
... and our noble guests .
i' m deeply honored , your highness .
have you had meat ?
none but what i brought .
well , sit down .
sit down there opposite me .
get up , sir lvor , and give him your place .
your highness !
get up !
get up , sir knight !
come , sir lvor .
out with you .
bring sir robin food at once , do you hear ?
such impudence must support a mighty appetite .
true enough , your highness .
we saxons have little to fatten on by the time your tax gatherers are through .
be seated , gentlemen .
no need to stand on ceremony on my account .
so you think you' re overtaxed , eh ?
overtaxed , overworked and paid off with a knife , a club or a rope .
why , you speak treason .
fluently .
i advise you to curb that wagging tongue of yours !
it' s a habit i' ve never formed .
you know , we saxons aren' t going to put up with these oppressions much longer .
oh , you' re not ?
as you may know , my brother is a prisoner of leopold of austria .
and from leopold , i have received a ransom demand of 1 50, 000 gold marks .
that means that you , my friends ... ... must collect in taxes not 2 gold marks in the pound , but 3 !
and the money' s to be turned over to me .
why to you , your highness ?
king richard appointed longchamps regent .
i' ve kicked longchamps out .
from now on , i am regent of england .
well , confound it , what are you goggling at ?
ls it so strange that i decide to rule when my brother' s a prisoner ?
who' s to say i shouldn' t ?
you , sir mortimer of leeds ?
not i , your highness .
you , sir boron ?
nor i , your highness .
you , sir ralf of durham ?
my sword is yours , your highness .
and what about our young saxon cockerel here ?
what' s the matter ?
have you no stomach for honest meat ?
for honest meat , yes .
but i' ve no stomach for traitors .
you call me traitor ?
you ?
yes .
and every man here who offers you allegiance .
your highness .
what do you call a man who takes advantage of a king' s misfortune ... ... to seize his power ?
and now , with the help of this sweet band of cutthroats ... ... you' il try to grind a ransom for him out of every helpless saxon .
a ransom that' il be used not to release richard , but to buy your way to the throne .
let me ram those words down his throat , your highness !
oh , no .
later .
let him spout for the moment .
and what do you propose to do ?
i' il organize revolt .
exact a death for a death .
and i' il never rest until every saxon in this shire can stand up , free men ... ... and strike a blow for richard and england .
have you finished ?
i' m only just beginning .
from this night on , i use every means in my power to fight you .
dickon !
such impudence , your highness .
lf i could only reach him .
stand back !
stand back !
open the door !
quick , guards , quick !
there' s a traitor inside trying to escape !
shut the door , quick !
traitor , sir ?
you infernal idiot !
which way did he go ?
there , through the gate .
after him !
guards !
horses !
dickon , follow mansfield !
to your troop !
up you go , quick .
the gallows oaks in sherwood tomorrow .
yes , master .
off you go , and good luck .
have it proclaimed in every village that this saxon locksley' s an outlaw .
hang anybody that gives him shelter or aid .
yes , your highness .
his possessions are forfeit to the crown .
seize his castle and his lands .
everything he owns .
and just to let the people know how the wind has changed ...
... the sooner you begin collecting the  the ransom , your highness ?
yes , yes , of course .
the ransom .
there' s a death sentence for your robin of locksley !
i' il have him dangling in a week .
i' m tired .
what ?
after a refreshing sleep in the greenwood ?
i' ve pulled seven acorns out of my ribs .
lovely fresh air .
my teeth ache with chattering .
nightingales singing .
an owl hooting in my ear all night .
hooting ?
he was singing you to sleep .
there' s a lusty infant .
he' d be a good one to reason into joining us .
by the look of him , his quarterstaff does his reasoning for him .
let' s see what he' s made of .
it' s your skull , not mine .
give way , little man .
only to a better man than myself .
he stands before you .
let him pass , robin .
it' s much too warm to brawl with such a windbag .
when i' ve brushed this fly off , i' il give you a dusting for good measure .
this fly has a mighty sting , friend .
i' ve only a staff and you threaten me with a longbow and a goose shaft .
aren' t you man enough ?
wait !
i' il get myself a staff .
ready ?
yes .
hey , pretty fellow , play a livelier tune that i can make this puny rascal dance to .
you need a merrier tune ?
well , how' s this ?
lf you want a lesson , you came to the right man !
where is he ?
who ?
this quarterstaff master .
here .
give my compliments to him .
my friend , i should ask payment for what i' m teaching you here today .
there' s something on account .
there' s your change .
my head hums like a swarm of bees .
what' s your name , friend ?
john little .
what' s yours ?
robin .
not robin of locksley ?
aye .
then i' m right glad i fell in with you .
' twas he who did the falling in .
i wanted to see what you were made of .
and i did .
i hope you' il not hold it against me .
on the contrary .
i love a man that can best me .
i' d like to join your company .
you shall . lf you can hold a breach like you held that bridge , you' re one of us .
welcome .
this is will of gamwell .
yeah .
he took good care not to wet his feathers .
just brain over brawn , friend .
you heard robin' s orders .
look nippy now and spread the word .
by royal decree , robin of locksley is declared an outlaw , condemned to death .
meet robin in sherwood at gallows oaks .
" any person aiding him will be hanged .
meet robin in sherwood at gallows oaks .
robin in sherwood .
at the gallows oak .
robin in sherwood .
robin .
gallows oak .
gallows oak .
i' ve called you here as freeborn englishmen , loyal to our king .
while he reigned over us we lived in peace .
but since prince john has seized the regency ... ... guy of gisbourne and his traitors have murdered and pillaged .
you' ve all suffered from their cruelty .
the ear loppings , the beatings ... ... the blindings with hot irons , the burning of our homes ... ... the mistreatment of our women .
it' s time we put an end to this !
robin' s right .
aye !
now , this forest is wide .
it can shelter , clothe and feed a band of good , determined men ... ... good swordsmen , good archers , good fighters !
men , if you' re willing to fight for our people , i want you .
are you with me ?
aye !
aye !
then kneel and swear this oath .
that you , the freemen of this forest , swear to despoil the rich only to give to the poor .
to shelter the old and helpless , to protect all women , rich or poor , norman or saxon .
swear to fight for a free england .
to protect her loyally until the return of our king and sovereign , richard the lion heart .
and swear to fight to the death against our oppressors !
we do !
we do solemnly swear !
string him up again !
he' il die if we lash him again , my lord .
oh , he' il die , will he ?
another one of their saxon impudences .
they' il do anything to trick us .
continue !
mercy , good master !
have mercy !
start him dancing !
this will teach you to defy prince john !
father !
father !
stop !
five men dead .
murdered .
sir lvor , nigel , baldwin , norbert .
you don' t have to name them .
our men can' t lay a hot iron ... ... in the eyes of a tax dodger without getting an arrow in the throat .
it' s an outrage !
he' s got to be stopped !
have you tried to stop him ?
yes , but i couldn' t find him .
what chance has anyone of finding him ?
every villager and woodcutter' s his friend .
every runaway serf and saxon thief in the shire is joining him .
i' ve sent spies in the forest to find out his hiding place ...
... but he strikes , and gone like a flash .
while you stay safely at home .
do you question my valor ?
am i not personally commanding the force ... ... that goes with sir guy and lady marian to kenworth castle ... ... to guard the tax money he is bringing back , with my sword and my life ?
i only hope this murderer does come out of his hiding place .
you hope !
enough of this wrangling !
i' il lay this outlaw by the heels when i get back .
well , well .
a curtal friar , and a mighty fat one at that .
he' s the man we need .
i' il enlist him .
be careful , robin .
that' s the friar of fountain' s abbey .
he' s noted
yeah , that' s right .
noted for his piety .
a humble soul , he is , with a heart as gentle as a lamb .
be easy with him , master .
oh , i won' t harm him .
you stay here lest you frighten him .
don' t interfere .
but that friar' s one of the most dangerous swordsmen
bless my soul , a miracle !
robber !
thief !
give me back my mutton joint !
lf you' re a robber you' il get nothing from me .
i' m a curtal friar and vowed to poverty .
lf this is poverty , i' il gladly share it with you .
that' s what you are doing .
give me back my mutton joint !
not so close , my ponderous one .
i' d have a word with you .
well ?
i live in the forest with good fellows who' ve everything in life save spiritual guidance .
and no merit but one .
and what' s that ?
we' re outlaws .
since we' re newborn to the greenwood , we need someone to do our christenings .
so we' ve chosen you .
not l .
they' ve probably all got your taking ways .
of course .
but you' il love them , one and all .
now , friar , let' s waste no more time .
we' il take the shortcut across the stream .
come .
i' il not .
i' m happy here .
you will come .
now then , since i don' t care to get my feet wet , you' il carry me across on your back .
on my back ?
bend !
you must learn obedience .
come on , bend .
on , now !
come on !
on !
on !
faster !
i' il have a gallop from you yet .
come now , fat one .
why don' t you give up ?
you can see i' m a better swordsman .
after i let a little air into your bellows you' il whistle a different tune .
by our lady , you' re the fairest swordsman i ever met .
must we go on , then ?
i think we' re even now , friar .
even ?
nay .
you' re still ahead of me by half a leg of mutton .
so  no .
hold there , friar .
enough .
come with me and i' il promise you the finest venison pasty , and the biggest you ever ate .
beef , boar' s head , casks of ale .
lf you' d said that before , you' d have saved us both a wetting .
come along .
you' il join us ?
aye .
lf only to convert you from your thieving ways .
you' re robin hood , aren' t you ?
the holy henchman !
hail , doubting friar !
robin .
aye ?
he' s well named friar tuck .
it would take half the deer in sherwood forest to fill that cavern .
and twice that to fill your empty head .
whoa , will !
what news , will ?
i' ve got word  it' s all right .
he' s one of us .
one of us ?
he looks like three of us .
aye .
and equal to a full dozen .
now , now , now , now .
friar tuck , will scarlett .
what' s it , will ?
sir guy of gisbourne is stopping by the way tonight .
has he got the tax money ?
a fortune !
when does he enter sherwood ?
tomorrow .
we' il have to postpone that stuffing match i promised , but it' il be double tomorrow !
come !
back to camp , men !
here , curb your appetite with that .
are you ready , men ?
aye .
see anything of them ?
not yet .
ls everything ready ?
they' il think they' ve got into a blooming hornet' s nest .
there they come .
hadn' t we better send out flanking guards ?
what for ?
well , this is sherwood , you know , and robin hood
afraid of that gallows face ?
afraid ?
certainly not , sir .
but it' s here that he' s boldest .
don' t worry .
we' re more than enough to take care of him .
outlaws have no face to show themselves against armed troops .
are you sure ?
i seem to remember
oh , yes , he jumps out of ambush at small parties , but he wouldn' t dare to attack us .
well , you old rooster , what do you see ?
make ready .
they' re in two sections .
do you see sir guy ?
he' s leading the second .
the treasure wagon is with him .
sir guy and the sheriff are watering their horses .
the advance guard' s far ahead .
good .
little john !
take your men and cut off the first section .
you surround the advance guard .
personally !
ready , men ?
aye , robin !
then stand ready for the signal .
come , will .
come on , let' s welcome sir guy .
look !
the guard !
quick !
welcome to sherwood , my lady .
what , sir guy , no greeting from you ?
why , that' s curious .
i' ve often heard that you' d give me a warm welcome if ever we met again .
you' re permitting this insolence without ?
fighting ?
i' m afraid he has no choice , my lady .
well , i have , you impudent rascal !
you' re not going to harm my lamb , my honeysuckle .
be still , bess .
we' ve nothing but peaceful intentions .
have we , men ?
we only want to stroke his pretty neck .
we won' t harm him much .
you see ?
well , let' s away .
don' t bother to mark the way .
it' il take keener men than you' ve got ...
... to find our camp again .
you' il hang for this , all of you .
a small price to pay for the company of such a charming lady .
what can a saxon hedge robber know of charm ?
or ladies ?
she means you .
me ?
a hedge robber ?
you must tell me more about myself .
you may have been misinformed .
perhaps , but i don' t find it interesting enough to bother about .
you just harm one hair of my lady' s head ... ... and that ugly face of yours will walk about with no neck under it .
now , mind !
what are you staring at ?
i ain' t never been out walking ...
... with a female before .
what female ?
you .
well , of all the impudence !
i suppose you say that to all women that tickle your fancy .
i' ve never tickled a woman' s fancy before .
no , i' ve never had a sweetheart .
do you mean to say you never had one single sweetheart in all your life ?
you don' t know what you missed , my lad .
i' ve had the bands on five times .
my lord !
your robes for the feast .
hurry up , put them on .
i won' t !
you will !
i will !
i will !
to them , this is heaven .
silks for rags , kindness instead of riches , limitless food instead of hunger .
why , they' re actually happy .
are they ?
aren' t you even a little pleased to see them enjoying themselves ?
i think it' s revolting .
your life' s been very sheltered , hasn' t it , my lady ?
too sheltered , perhaps .
but if you could know these people as i know them .
their patience , loyalty , goodness .
friar tuck !
these should fit sir guy .
me lord .
here is your raiment for the banquet .
when you' ve done with them , give them to prince john .
to the tables , everybody , and stuff yourselves !
may i serve you , my lady ?
i' m afraid the company has spoiled my appetite .
misfortune .
now , mine is excellent .
a little mutton , my lady ?
i said i' m not hungry .
why , so you did .
i' d forgotten .
well , you will let me know if you regain your appetite , won' t you ?
friends !
friends !
i' d supposed , with you , that this sir guy of gisbourne was a scurvy fellow ... ... and a bitter enemy of ours .
and yet , look !
he provides us with this tasty supper .
and is this the end of his beneficence ?
why , no !
for in his train today he' s brought us half a score of boxes full of jewels and silks ... ... and more , about 30, 000 golden marks wrested from the northern shires .
you wouldn' t dare .
sit down !
some of you might think our host intended this treasure for the coffers of prince john ... ... instead of to ransom the king .
and you would be right .
but a strange thing happened .
a change of heart overtook him in the forest , and there it is , safe and sound !
you speak of loyalty .
yes .
why not ?
i suppose you and your cutthroats intend to send this treasure to richard ?
you wouldn' t dream of keeping it yourselves .
friends !
what shall we do with this treasure ?
divide it amongst ourselves ?
hold it for richard !
it belongs to the king !
convinced ?
i may have been hasty ....
but why you , a knight , should live here like an animal , robbing , killing , outlawed ... ?
are you really interested in learning why i turned outlaw ?
or are you afraid of the truth ?
or of me , perhaps ?
i' m afraid of nothing .
least of all of you .
good .
then come with me .
oh , so you are afraid .
well , men .
hi !
hardly an inspiring sight for such pretty eyes as yours , i' m sure .
but these poor devils have all had their homes burned .
their families beaten and starved to death by your tax gatherers .
bless you , robin .
we' il never forget you .
our humble thanks , master .
may we be worthy , robin .
you are , mother , you are .
have you eaten well , friend ?
yes , thank you , robin hood .
we humbly thank you , master .
i' m sorry to have to show you that .
but once these poor people were happy and contented .
just simple villagers who never harmed a soul .
and now ....
tortured , eyes put out , tongues slit , ears hacked off .
they come to me for protection against your norman friends .
but you' ve taken norman lives .
yes , those that deserved it .
the cruel and unjust .
you' re a strange man .
strange ?
because i can feel for beaten , helpless people ?
no , you' re strange because you want to do something about it .
you' re willing to defy sir guy , even prince john himself .
to risk your own life .
and one of those men was a norman .
norman or saxon .
what' s that matter ?
it' s injustice i hate , not the normans .
but it' s lost you your rank , your lands .
it' s made you a hunted outlaw , when you might have lived in comfort and security .
what' s your reward for all this ?
reward ?
you just don' t understand , do you ?
i' m sorry .
i do begin to see a little now .
lf you do , then that' s reward enough .
now that you' ve robbed us and had your fill of insulting us , we wish to leave .
come , lady marian .
my men will escort my lady .
but before you take leave , it might be well if you thanked her for saving your life .
my life ?
do you think you would have left this forest alive if it hadn' t been for her presence here ?
peter !
harold !
yes , master ?
take six men and guide our loyal host and his nervous friend to the nottingham road .
but our horses , our clothes .
you' il return to nottingham as you are , on foot .
this , sir guy , will at least be a lesson to you in humility , if not in mercy .
your people will be returned tomorrow .
but the lady marian .
you' d best be started before i have a change of mind .
i think we' d better go .
now , my lady .
friar tuck !
little john !
take the lady to the abbey of the black canons ... ... so tomorrow the bishop can give her escort the rest of the way .
may i go too ?
with your permission , my lady ?
goodbye , my lady .
goodbye .
he took everything you had collected ?
every silver penny .
and you two nincompoops sat there and let him do it .
oh , we resisted as well as we could .
where are your wounds ?
your bruises ?
and where are your men ?
what did your highness expect ?
with the lady marian in our company and locksley' s men outnumbering us .
and not an arrow wound to divide among them , i suppose .
and more than 30, 000 marks in the hands of that wolf' s head .
that fellow' s got to be taken .
understand ?
and how does your highness suggest that he be taken ?
lf i may be so bold as to inquire ?
mind your words , gisbourne .
you' re fortunate not to be paying for this with your head .
your highness , sir , i could muster an army and surround sherwood .
you couldn' t capture him ...
you mind your words . ... if he sat in your lap shooting arrows at a crow .
arrows !
he said shooting arrows at a crow .
take that silly looking bonnet off .
that stirs something in my mind .
perhaps we can' t take him by force .
he' s too well protected .
knows sherwood' s hidden paths well .
but
but what ?
we' il outwit him .
we' il hold an archery tournament !
archery tour
and have him fly in on the end of one of his own arrows ?
that' s marvelous .
he' s the finest archer in the north .
think he' d forgo shooting ... ... against the archers of all england ?
we' il give a prize .
say , a golden arrow .
and ask him to risk his neck for that ?
that won' t be the only bait , with the lady marian presenting the arrow herself .
what do you mean ?
when they came out of the forest , she seemed very friendly .
and didn' t you notice how his eyes never left her ?
yes , yes , i noticed .
well , then !
well , then , how do we get word to him ?
get word to robin ... ... who has an eye in every bush and ears in every wall ?
but even if he comes , won' t he be disguised ?
whether he be dressed as priest , beggar , knight , palmer , what disguise can conceal ... ... the finest archer in england ?
the man who wins the golden arrow will be robin hood .
will you take that bonnet off ?
i hope our little golden hook will catch the fish .
you hope ?
oh , it will if he' s here .
lf he' s not , we' il stick your head upon the target and shoot at that .
are your men sure of their orders ?
yes .
they' re stationed all around the field .
even a worm couldn' t get through .
you talk as if this were a trap .
oh , no , my dear .
just a precaution in case the saxons create a disturbance .
by orders of his highness prince john , the champions of sir guy and the knights ... ... will be limited to three flights of arrows for the eliminations .
the winning team will meet all comers .
you know it' s a trap .
a golden arrow , from the lady herself .
they' ve cooked up this thing to take you .
well , what of it ?
you know what' il happen if they do .
where' s your sporting blood ?
sir guy accepted our invitation .
we' d be rude not to accept his .
it' d be ruder to get your neck stretched .
there , my band getting fat and overfed .
where' s your love of fights , risk , adventure ?
well , since our friend seems to have gone a little mad , i' il have to see him through .
we' il have to see him through .
prepare final flight .
does my lady find it interesting ?
lady marian ?
oh , i' m sorry .
i asked if you found it interesting .
yes , very .
they' re splendid archers .
you' il find it much more interesting later on .
the winning team will compete as individuals .
captain phillip of arras .
elwyn the welshman .
matt of sleaford .
they now challenge all comers .
the men who' d shoot against that lot have to have the eyes of a falcon .
they' re far too good for me .
i' m not shooting today .
remaining archers will use center target .
matt of sleaford , out !
elwyn the welshman , out !
the tall tinker .
now is the time .
not so hasty , sir guy .
i' m enjoying myself .
let them finish the match .
but he could  have your men close in if you wish .
look .
yeah , they' re closing in .
i hope robin sees them .
i must commend your highness for the subtlety of your scheme .
very good .
would you say you' d seen that tall fellow before ?
and if i had , what interest could a tinker have for me ?
phillip of arras shoots next .
tie !
you will be allowed another flight .
target' s a deal too close .
can we have it removed to a fit distance to shoot at ?
another 20 paces !
lf your archer captain wins at that distance , i' il give you 1 000 gold marks for him .
win or lose , i' il give him to your highness for a favor .
provided you let me deal with this wolf' s head in my own way .
done .
i' m leaving for norwich immediately after the tournament anyway ... ... so you may do what you please with him .
why , he can' t win now .
no living man could beat that shot .
i' il wager 1 00 marks on phillip of arras !
he split phillip' s arrow .
the tinker wins !
he wins !
what is your name , archer ?
godfrey of sherwood , your highness .
how is it that a tinker learned so well the use of arms ?
even a peaceful tinker must protect himself these days from treachery and other things .
it' s earned you more than you bargained for today .
i pronounce you champion archer of england .
and from the gracious hand of lady marian fitzwalter , you' il receive your reward .
advance .
i ....
here is your prize , sir archer .
it' s indeed an honor to receive it from the hands of so beautiful a lady .
how is it that you didn' t use a black arrow ?
that' s my court of last resort , sir guy .
lts verdict is always final .
arrest this man !
that' s a good idea .
you' re a very rash young man .
and i' m sorry i can' t be in nottingham to see what gisbourne has in store for you .
it' il be something special , i' m sure .
i' m sure .
sorry i underestimated you .
next time perhaps
there' il be no next time .
take him away !
robin of locksley .
known to some as the outlaw robin hood .
after trial , in which you did not produce one witness in your behalf ... ... you' ve been found guilty of outlawry , theft , murder , abduction ... ... false pretenses , contempt of the crown , poaching in royal forests and high treason .
haven' t you forgotten a count or two ?
surely it' s a crime under the noble prince john to love one' s country .
to protect serfs from injustice and be loyal to one' s king .
lf i could add anything to the charges against you , i would most gladly do so .
it is the sentence of this tribunal , on the morrow at high noon you be taken ... ... to the square in nottingham and there hanged by the neck until you are dead .
there may be some who will regret that a man of your peculiar talents ... ... should be cut off so early in life .
but personally
you think the sentence extremely lenient .
thank you .
what' s troubling you , my lady ?
ls it the outlaw ?
yes .
i hate to see a human being trapped ....
bess , you know where his men may be found , don' t you ?
why , my lady , how should i know ?
don' t put me off .
that little man who liked you .
you' ve been seeing him ?
yes , my lady .
tell me where .
do you want to send a message ?
to his men , yes .
well , my lady , i have had a nip of ale of a night , just now and again ... ... at a place in the town and i won' t deny as some of the others were there .
where was it ?
oh , bess , please tell me !
it was a tavern , my lady .
the saracen' s head in pilgrim court .
the landlord' s name is humility prin .
humility prin .
knock at the door and say , " a locksley .
" a locksley .
yes , but  get me a cloak , quickly !
yes , madame .
oh , dear ....
but there must be some way  lf we had to , couldn' t we storm the place ?
why , you' d need an army with a battering ram to even dent it .
aye , he' il be hanged for sure .
maybe little john' s right .
perhaps we should
a locksley .
what is it , prin ?
a lady , sir .
the lady marian .
what ?
it' s a trap , will .
watch those windows .
she has the password , all right .
ls she alone ?
yes , sir .
fetch her in .
what do you want , my lady ?
i want to help him .
how did you find us here ?
never mind that now .
please don' t stand there staring .
tell me what i can do .
don' t trust her .
it' s a norman trick .
would i come here alone if it were a trap ?
what' s to prevent your killing me if ? ls there no one here with sense enough to see ?
one moment .
we have to make sure , my child .
you' re a good daughter of the church ?
you swear by our lady that you want to help robin ?
i swear , good father .
have you thought of a way ?
yes .
can you get us in the castle ?
that' s no good .
he' s heavily guarded .
but i thought of another way .
listen .
this is a rare treat , isn' t it , my lady ?
yes , isn' t it ?
with locksley out of the way , we' il stamp out the rest .
won' t it be a pleasant surprise for prince john when he returns ?
and to think that i was once foolish enough to believe that you rather liked him .
why , your hand is trembling .
take him to the gallows .
take him up there .
he' il not be so insolent when they' ve stretched his neck .
get ready .
stop him !
stop !
guards !
friar tuck !
much !
here we are , sir !
here we are , safe and sound !
back to camp !
robin !
where are you ?
here i am .
stand by !
he is different from anyone i' ve ever known .
he' s , well , he' s brave and he' s reckless , and yet he' s gentle and kind .
he' s not brutal like ....
tell me , when you are in love , is it ... ... well , is it hard to think of anybody but one person ?
yes , indeed , and sometimes there' s a bit of trouble sleeping .
i know , but it' s a nice kind of not sleeping .
yes , and it affects your appetite too .
not that i' ve noticed it' s done that to you , except when he was waiting to be hanged .
does it make you want to be with him all the time ?
yes .
and when he' s with you , your legs are weak as water .
tell me , my lady , when he looks at you , do you feel a kind of prickly feeling ... ... like goosy pimples running all up and down your spine ?
then there' s not a doubt of it .
doubt of what ?
that you' re in love !
what do you want ?
robin !
i must say .
i must say !
keep quiet , bess .
are you completely mad ?
why did you come here ?
to see you .
but don' t you realize that ?
my men told me what you did for me , so i' ve come to thank you .
and after what i couldn' t help overhearing about that prickly feeling ... ... l' m very glad i did come .
that was a game .
now , you' ve got to go at once !
a game ?
well , couldn' t i join in ?
of course , i probably wouldn' t be as good at it as this pretty young girl .
but i could do my best .
bess , will you leave us ?
please !
now , let' s see , where does this game begin ?
oh , i know .
it' s simple .
we' il start where you' re in love with me .
you are , aren' t you ?
because i am with you , terribly .
that' s why i came .
i had to see you again .
you must go at once .
and i don' t love you .
oh !
are you sure ?
yes .
very well then , i' il go .
you know , this is rather unfriendly of you , exposing me to my enemies like this .
now , let me see .
there' s a fat old captain of the guard down there with bow legs .
lf i drop on him that' il bend them out worse .
an archer !
he' s too thin .
i might miss him altogether .
robin !
the very thing .
five men at arms in a group .
they' il break the fall beautifully .
goodbye , my lady !
robin !
yes ?
please .
then you do love me ?
don' t you ?
don' t you ?
you know i do .
well , that' s different .
do you know you' re very impudent ?
me ?
you are !
when my guardian , king richard , finds out about your being in love with me
i know , he' il make me court jester .
he won' t !
he' il stick your funny head on london gate .
and a fine decoration it will be , my bold norman beauty .
i' m not bold .
well , you' re norman .
well , i don' t hold that against you .
and you are a beauty .
you' re the most beautiful  you' re leaving at once .
please , darling , every minute you' re here you' re in danger .
i' il go .
marian , will you come with me ?
to sherwood ?
i' ve nothing to offer you but a life of hardship and danger , but we' d be together .
but , robin , dear  i know .
it' s asking a lot , but who knows ... ... how long it' il be before richard returns .
friar tuck could marry us .
will you ?
because i love you , robin , i' d come .
even the danger would mean nothing if you were with me .
then you will ?
no .
listen to me , darling .
you remember that day in sherwood forest ?
i realized then for the first time that what you were doing was right ... ... and that we were wrong .
no , let me finish .
you taught me england is bigger than normans and saxons ... ... fighting and hating each other .
that it belongs to all of us , to live peacefully together ... ... loyal only to richard and to england .
but , darling , you could help .
i could help much more by watching for treachery here ... ... and leaving you free to protect richard' s people until he returns .
now do you see why you have to go back to your men alone ?
go now , quickly , dearest .
goodbye , darling .
goodbye .
goodbye , my love .
goodbye .
you gentlemen have traveled far ?
yes , quite a distance .
i' m sorry i can' t give you better food .
there is little left to us these days .
this will be enough .
the inn at luton was well supplied .
how is that ?
that' s a norman inn .
but it' s an outrage !
i' il complain to prince john .
i' il have this rascal' s ears , no matter how .
dares to rob me !
strip my person of jewels !
what' s this country coming to when a high churchman can' t travel the forest in safety ?
who' s he ?
the bishop of the black canons .
do you wish to go on after dinner ?
no .
we can' t reach the abbey tonight .
i' il stay .
tend to the horses .
yes , your grace .
bring food to us !
yes , your grace , at once !
it' s no longer safe to journey anywhere .
robbers at every turn of the road .
what happened , your grace ?
i told you !
we' ve been robbed .
not a chance to defend ourselves .
they burst on us from ambush .
who did ?
why , robin hood , of course .
there' s no other with impudence enough .
robin hood again , sire .
you' ve heard of him , then ?
oh , he seems well known hereabouts .
oh , then you' re strange to this shire ?
more or less .
what might be your names , gentlemen ?
they' re hardly important enough to deserve your interest .
landlord , where' s our ale ?
coming , sirs .
will you gentlemen be remaining here tonight ?
we hadn' t decided , your grace .
what would you advise ?
well , there' s so much danger on the road , you' d be far safer here .
we will then , since we' il have the added pleasure of your company .
well , i should really like to stay , but i recollected some urgent affairs at my abbey .
some other time , or perhaps you would break your journey and sup with me tomorrow .
your grace is too kind .
then i bid you good evening , gentlemen , and god speed you in the morning .
thank you .
good night .
the window !
are there beds prepared , landlord ?
let' s to sleep , then .
i' m tired .
i' m afraid he suspects , sire .
i fear so .
his grace is a norman .
did you see the fear on the landlord' s face when he came in ?
i' ve seen it in the faces of thousands since we returned .
i ought never to have left england .
i noticed when robin hood' s name is mentioned
the mysterious outlaw whom we have sought .
ln vain .
however , the bishop didn' t have any difficulty meeting him .
which gives me an idea .
and you' re sure it was richard ?
no doubt of it .
how like my dear brother this is !
he couldn' t rot in durnstein like any decent man .
but richard has no army .
no , your highness .
lf he had , we should have heard of it .
lf my brother happened to be killed
england would have a new king .
that would be murder !
i' il have no part
you' il do as you' re told !
that' s very simple .
keep your mouth closed .
your highness , i beg of you !
how long will you retain your abbey if richard survives to find out ... ... what you' ve been up to these years he' s been away ?
go on , gisbourne .
who' s to ... ?
dickon was a knight before your brother hacked off his spurs ... ... over some little mischance .
there' s nothing he wouldn' t do for a king who' d restore him to rank .
you don' t love my brother , i hear .
i have little reason to , your highness .
you know this tavern ?
yes .
lf richard dies  dickon returns to the roll of english knights .
am i not right ?
with the manor and estate of robin of locksley to support his rank .
when shall i start ?
lmmediately .
how many men will you need ?
i shall do it better alone , your highness .
the sooner you' re crowned king
the better for my friends ?
you' re a clever fellow , gisbourne .
thank you , your majesty .
return to your abbey and make preparations to proclaim me king ... ... here in nottingham , the day after tomorrow .
do you suppose she heard ?
i don' t know .
and now you know why robin' s got to find king richard at once and warn him .
take this note to much at saracen' s head .
my lady' s hearing is a little defective tonight .
when you knock at a lady' s door as if it were a tavern , you deserve to wait .
you seem upset .
upset ?
why should i be ?
oh , come now , my dear lady marian .
you' ve played the innocent long enough .
let' s be frank with one another .
i don' t see the need .
you' re charming , lady marian , but not exactly clever .
you couldn' t have failed ... ... to overhear what prince john and i were talking about .
oh , no , no , no .
please don' t trouble to deny it .
and your first thought , as richard' s loyal ward , was to warn him .
am i not right ?
why , how could i warn richard ?
how did locksley and his men arrange his escape ... ... from hanging after the archery match ?
someone here in the castle must have got word to him .
that' s ridiculous !
when richard' s in danger , what more natural ... ... than that you should try to warn him through locksley ?
and you do intend to warn him , don' t you ?
don' t you ?
no !
lf that' s true , perhaps you' d explain before prince john ... ... and the court of execution the meaning of this .
guard !
escort my lady marian to the great hall .
not only has she consorted with this saxon rebel ... ... found guilty of outlawry , theft , murder , abduction and high treason ... ... but she has betrayed her own norman people .
are you not ashamed , my lady marian ?
yes , i am .
bitterly .
but it' s a shame that i' m a norman ... ... after seeing the things my fellow countrymen have done to england .
at first i wouldn' t believe .
because i was a norman i wouldn' t let myself believe ... ... that the horrors you inflicted on the saxons weren' t just .
i know now why you tried so hard to kill this outlaw whom you despised .
it' s because he was the one man in england who protected the helpless ... ... against beasts who were drunk on human blood !
and now you intend to murder your own brother !
you' il be sorry you interfered .
sorry ?
i' d do it again if you kill me for it .
a prophetic speech , my lady , for that is exactly what is going to happen to you .
you wouldn' t dare .
i' m the royal ward of king richard and no one but the king himself ... ... has the right to condemn me to death .
you are quite right , my dear .
and it shall be a king who will order your execution for high treason ... ... exactly 48 hours from now .
take her away .
have you got it all in your stupid head now ?
of course i have .
well , give robin the whole message exactly like i told it to you .
bess , where was dickon supposed to find king richard ?
oh , never mind him !
what do i care about your kings and thrones and such ?
robin has gotta do something to save my baby !
come on , old girl .
robin will look after her , all right .
where' s dickon heading for ?
kent road tavern .
kent road tavern ?
you can save three miles and cut him off through low wood .
come on , lass , give us a kiss and wish me luck .
hurry up and take your ugly face out of here .
oh , much .
oh , you will be careful , won' t you ?
of course i will .
greetings , sir abbot !
you' ve traveled far this morning ?
too far to be patient with delay now .
perhaps it' s the weight of your purse that wearies you .
now , i can remedy that .
lf it weighs more than a just amount i' il share it with those who have less .
come .
you think i hand my purse to every rough lout who asks for it ?
you see , sir abbot ?
we' re poor outlaws , with nothing to eat but the king' s deer ... ... while you have property , rents , and silver .
so your purse !
i' ve traveled far on the king' s business and the silver i have left ... ... equals no more than 60 marks .
what ?
are you friendly to our good king richard ?
i love no man better .
by that speech you save half your money .
give me 30 marks for the poor and the rest you may keep .
then i can go free ?
any friend of richard' s is free of this forest .
would you honor us by sharing meat with us ?
gladly .
then come .
well , sir rascal , tell me , who are you ?
i' m called robin hood .
it seems i' ve heard of you .
nothing good , i hope .
oh , now i remember !
how does your loyalty to richard set on a killer of knights ... ... a poacher of the king' s deer and an outlaw ?
those i kill died from misusing the trust that richard left them .
and the worst rogue of these is the king' s own brother .
oh , then you blame prince john .
no , i blame richard .
his task was defending his people instead of deserting them to fight in foreign lands .
what ?
you' d condemn holy crusades ?
i' il condemn anything that leaves the task of holding england to outlaws like me .
much !
much , what' s happened to you ?
take me to robin , quick !
much , what' s happened ?
king richard' s in england . ln sherwood !
what ?
prince john sent dickon to kent road tavern last night to kill the king .
will , take 50 men to the kent road tavern  no need , master , no need .
i headed dickon off .
he ain' t gonna murder no one no more .
but the king ?
where is he ?
i don' t know , master .
men , richard must be found .
he must be brought here for safety .
little john , take a party and scour the country .
friar tuck , into the town .
will , search every inn and cottage .
don' t rest , day or night , until he' s found .
understand ?
you don' t need to search for richard , robin .
he' s in good hands .
the best in england .
what do you mean ?
where is he ?
here !
sire .
all these have remained loyal .
rise , sir robin .
rise , men of sherwood .
sire , prince john' s calling bishop of the black canons ... ... to proclaim him king in nottingham tomorrow .
how' d you learn this ?
lady marian .
she overheard .
they' ve taken her for treason .
she' s been condemned to the block for warning us .
he wouldn' t dare execute the king' s ward .
you underestimate him . lf we' re to save her and your throne , we' ve got to act now !
by attacking nottingham castle ?
without an army it' il be much too strong .
your men will be killed .
lf the bishop of the black canons is performing the ceremony tomorrow ... ... suppose we visit him at his abbey tonight and persuade him to suggest a way .
brace up .
smile !
wider !
still sure it wasn' t you who warned my brother i was in england ?
why , sire , believe me , l
your grace , smile !
you' il sweat the lard off that fat carcass of yours ... ... before this day' s over , my pudgy friend .
and i hope some norman sword whittles you down to size !
oh , lord , we beseech thee .
sanctify this thy servant , our royal prince john .
enrich his noble heart and bestow upon him all princely virtues .
amen .
no news of richard .
no .
none , your highness .
then dickon must have
sir dickon , your highness .
of course .
of course .
we are ready for the ceremony , your majesty .
remember .
by what authority do you , john lackland , prince of england ... ... claim to be crowned this day , sovereign of the realm ... ... and as defender of the holy sepulcher , to receive the blessing of the church ?
by right of blood succession .
according to the law of the realm .
ls it of your own free will that you thus depose your brother ... ... richard the lion heart of england ?
richard no longer exists !
from this moment forward , i , john , am king of england !
aren' t you a little premature , brother ?
richard !
the lion heart !
he' s lying !
he' s an imposter !
the king lives !
men of sherwood !
robin hood !
it' s a trick of the outlaws !
kill him !
seize him !
did i upset your plans ?
you' ve come to nottingham once too often !
when this is over , there' il be no need for me to come again .
your sword , gisbourne .
know any prayers , my friend ?
i' il say one for you !
save yourself , robin !
the door , quick !
quick , or i' il trim that beard for you !
but , richard , richard !
i thought
you thought i was murdered !
oh , no , no .
i didn' t mean to ....
after all , richard , i am your brother .
yes , sire , he is your brother .
yes , my brother .
i could forgive you if your treachery were against me and not my subjects .
i banish you and your followers from england for the remainder of my lifetime .
take them away .
see that they leave england .
i further banish from my realm all injustices and oppressions ... ... which have burdened my people .
and i pray that under my rule ... ... normans and saxons alike will share the rights of englishmen .
long live richard the lion heart !
what about you , robin ?
my sword is yours , sire , now and always .
ls there nothing the king can grant the outlaw ... ... who showed him his duty to his country ?
yes , your majesty , a pardon for the men of sherwood .
granted with all my heart .
long live richard the lion heart !
but is there nothing for yourself ?
there' s but one thing else , sire .
and do you too wish ... ?
more than anything in the world , sire .
kneel , robin hood .
arise , robin , baron of locksley , earl of sherwood and nottingham ... ... and lord of all the lands and manors appertaining thereto .
my first command to you , my lord earl ... ... is to take in marriage the hand of the lady marian .
long live robin hood !
long live robin hood !
long live lady marian !
and what say you to that , baron of locksley ?
may i obey all your commands with equal pleasure , sire !
