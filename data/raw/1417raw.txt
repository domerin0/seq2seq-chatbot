29 . 970
once upon a time in a faraway land a young prince lived in a shining castle .
although he had everything his heart desired the prince was spoiled , selfish and unkind .
but then , one winter' s night an old beggar woman came to the castle and offered him a single rose in return for shelter from the bitter cold .
repulsed by her haggard appearance the prince sneered at the gift and turned the old woman away but she warned him not to be deceived by appearances for beauty is found within and when he dismissed her again the old woman' s ugliness melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress .
the prince tried to apologize , but it was too late for she had seen that there was no love in his heart and as punishment , she transformed him into a hideous beast and placed a powerful spell on the castle and all who lived there .
ashamed of his monstrous form the beast concealed himself inside his castle with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world .
the rose she had offered was truly an enchanted rose which would bloom until his 21st year .
lf he could learn to love another and earn her love in return by the time the last petal fell then the spell would be broken .
lf not , he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time .
as the years passed , he fell into despair and lost all hope for who could ever learn to love a beast ?
little town , it' s a quiet village
every day lile the one before
little town , full of little people
waking up ... to ... say ...
bonjour !
bonjour !
bonjour !
bonjour !
bonjour !
there goes the baker
with his tray like always
the same old bread and rolls to sell
every morning just the same
since the morning that we came
to this poor provincial town ...
good morning , belle .
good morning , monsieur .
where are you off to ?
the bookshop .
i just finished the most wonderful story about a beanstalk and an ogre , and ...
that' s nice .
marie !
the baguettes .
hurry up !
look , there she goes
the girl is strange , no question
dazed and distracted , can' t you tell ?
never part of any crowd
' cause her head' s up on some cloud
no denying she' s a funny girl , that belle
bonjour
good day
how is your family ?
bonjour
good day
how is your wife ?
i need six eggs
that' s too expensive
there must be more than this provincial life ...
ah , belle .
good morning .
i' ve come to return the book i borrowed .
finished already ?
oh , i couldn' t put it down .
have you got anything new ?
not since yesterday .
that' s all right .
i' il borrow ... this one .
that one ?
but you' ve read it twice .
well , it' s my favorite far off places daring sword fights magic spells , a prince in disguise .
lf you like it all that much , it' s yours .
but , sir ...
i insist .
well , thank you .
thank you very much .
look , there she goes
that girl is so peculiar
i wonder if she' s feeling well
with a dreamy , far off look
and her nose stuck in a book
what a puzzle to the rest of us is belle
oh , isn' t this amazing ?
it' s my favorite part because you' il see
here' s where she meets prince charming
but she won' t discover that it' s him
till chapter three
hey !
hey !
hey !
hey !
hey !
now , it' s no wonder that her name means beauty
her looks have got no parallel
but behind that fair facade
i' m afraid she' s rather odd
very different from the rest of us
she' s nothing like the rest of us
yes , different from the rest of us is belle
wow , you didn' t miss a shot , gaston .
you' re the greatest hunter in the whole world .
i know .
no beast alive stands a chance against you and no girl , for that matter .
it' s true , lefou and i' ve got my sights set on that one .
the inventor' s daughter ?
she' s the one the lucky girl i' m going to marry .
but , she ...
the most beautiful girl in town .
i know , but ...
that makes her the best and don' t i deserve the best ?
well , of course .
i mean , you do , but ...
right from the moment when i met her , saw her
i said , " she' s gorgeous , " and i fell
i said , " she' s gorgeous , " and i fell
here in town there' s only she who is beautiful as me
so , i' m making plans to woo and marry belle
look , there he goes , isn' t he dreamy ?
monsieur gaston , oh , he' s so cute
be still , my heart , i' m hardly breathing
he' s such a tall , dark , strong and handsome brute
bonjour pardon good day mais oui

what lovely grapes
ten yards some cheese ' scuse me one pound

it' s stale they smell
madame' s mistaken
there must be more
than this provincial life
just watch , i' m going to make belle my wife
look , there she goes
a girl who' s strange but special
a most peculiar mademoiselle
it' s a pity and a sin
she doesn' t quite fit in
' cause she really is a funny girl
a beauty but a funny girl
she really is a funny girl
that belle ...
bonjour , bonjour .
hello , belle .
bonjour , gaston .
gaston , may i have my book , please ?
how can you read this ?
there' s no pictures .
well , some people use their imagination .
belle , it' s about time you got your head out of those books and paid attention to more important things ...
like me .
the whole town' s talking about it .
it' s not right for a woman to read .
soon she starts getting ideas , and thinking ...
gaston , you are positively primeval .
why , thank you , belle .
what do you say you and me take a walk over to the tavern and take a look at my trophies ?
maybe some other time .
what' s wrong with her ?
she' s crazy .
he' s gorgeous .

he' s a genius .

where would you get an idea like that ?
oh , i don' t know .
it' s just that i' m not sure i fit in here .
there' s no one i can really talk to .
what about that gaston ?
he' s a handsome fellow .
he' s handsome , all right , and rude , and conceited , and ...
oh , papa , he' s not for me .
well , don' t you worry
' cause this invention' s going to be the start of a new life for us .
i think that' s done it .

since the girl is going to be with us for quite some time
i was thinking that you might want to offer her a more comfortable room .
then again , maybe not .
you didn' t even let me say good bye .
i' il never see him again .
i didn' t get to say good bye .
i' il show you to your room .
my room ?
but i thought ...
you want to stay in the tower ?
no .
then follow me .

huh ?
oh .
i , uh , hope you like it here .
the castle is your home now , so you can go anywhere you like except the west wing .
what' s in the west ... ?
it' s forbidden !
now , if you need anything my servants will attend you .
dinner .
lnvite her to dinner .
you will join me for dinner .
that' s not a request !
who does she think she is ?
that girl has tangled with the wrong man .
no one says no to gaston .
darn right .
dismissed , rejected ... publicly humiliated .
why , it' s more than i can bear .
more beer ?
what for ?
nothing helps .
i' m disgraced .
who , you ?
never !
gaston , you' ve got to pull yourself together .
gosh , it disturbs me to see you , gaston
looking so down in the dumps
every guy here' d love to be you , gaston
even when taking your lumps
there' s no man in town as admired as you
you' re everyone' s favorite guy
everyone' s awed and inspired by you
and it' s not very hard to see why
no ... one' s ...
slick as gaston
no one' s quick as gaston
no one' s neck' s as incredibly thick as gaston
for there' s no man in town half as manly
perfect , a pure paragon
you can ask any tom , dick or stanley
and they' il tell you whose team
they prefer to be on
ooh !
no ... one' s ... been like gaston
a kingpin like gaston
no one' s got a full cleft
ln his chin like gaston
as a specimen , yes , i' m intimidating
my , what a guy , that gaston
give five " hurrahs !
give 12 " hip hips !
gaston is the best and the rest is all drips
no ... one ...
fights like gaston
douses lights like gaston
ln a wrestling match , nobody bites like gaston
for there' s no one as burly and brawny
as you see , i' ve got biceps to spare
not a bit of him scraggly or scrawny
that' s right
and every last inch of me' s covered with hair
no one hits like gaston
matches wits like gaston
ln a spitting match , nobody spits like gaston
i' m especially good at expectorating
ptooey !
ten points for gaston !
when i was a lad
i ate four dozen eggs
every morning to help me get large
and now that i' m grown
i eat five dozen eggs
so i' m roughly the size of a barge
no ... one ...
shoots like gaston
makes those beauts like gaston
then goes tromping around wearing boots like gaston
i use antlers in all of my decorating
my , what a guy
gaston !
help !
help !
someone help me !
maurice ?
please , please !
i need your help .
he' s got her ...
he' s got her locked in the dungeon .

whoa !

who' s got belle locked in a dungeon ?
a beast !
a horrible , monstrous beast .
ls it a big beast ?
huge !
with a long ugly snout ?
hideously ugly .
and sharp , cruel fangs ?
yes , yes .
will you help me ?
all right , old man .
we' il help you out .

oh , thank you .
thank you .
thank you !
oh !
oh !
crazy old maurice .
he' s always good for a laugh .
crazy old maurice , hmm ?
crazy old maurice ... hmm .
lefou , i' m afraid i' ve been thinking
a dangerous pastime ...
i know
but that wacky old coot is belle' s father
and his sanity' s only so so
now the wheels in my head have been turning
since i looked at that loony old man
see , i promised myself
i' d be married to belle
and right now , i' m evolving a plan
lf i ...
yes ?
then we ...
no !
would she ... ?
guess !
now i get it !
let' s go !
no ... one ...
plots like gaston
takes cheap shots like gaston
plans to persecute harmless crackpots like gaston
so his marriage we soon will be celebrating
my , what a guy !
gaston !
will no one help me ?
who is it ?
mrs. potts , dear .
i thought you might like a spot of tea .
but you' re ... you' re a ...
ooh !
careful .
this is impossible .
i know it is .
but here we are .
i told you she was pretty , mama , didn' t l ?
all right , chip , now , that' il do .
slowly now .
don' t spill .
thank you .
want to see me do a trick ?
chip !
oops .
sorry .
that was a very brave thing you did , my dear .
we all think so .
but i' ve lost my father , my dreams ... everything .
cheer up , child .
it' il turn out all right in the end .
you' il see .
oh , listen to me .
jabbering on while there' s a supper to get on the table .
chip !
bye .
well , now , what shall we dress you in for dinner ?
oh , let' s see what i got in my drawers .
ooh !
how embarrassing .
ah , here we are .
you' il look ravishing in this one .
that' s very kind of you , but ...
i' m not going to dinner .
oh , but you must .
dinner is served .
what' s taking so long ?
i told her to come down .
why isn' t she here yet ?
oh , try to be patient , sir .
the girl has lost her father and her freedom , all in one day .
master , have you thought that perhaps this girl could be the one to break the spell ?
of course i have .
i' m not a fool .
good !
so , you fall in love with her , she falls in love with you and poof ! the spell is broken .
we' il be human again by midnight .
ooh , it' s not that easy , lumiere .
these things take time .
but the rose has already begun to wilt .
oh , it' s no use .
she' s so beautiful , and i' m ...
well , look at me !
oh , you must help her to see past all that .
i don' t know how .
well , you can start by making yourself more presentable .
straighten up .
try to act like a gentleman .
ah , yes .
when she comes in give her a dashing , debonair smile .
come , come , show me the smile .
but don' t frighten the poor girl .
lmpress her with your rapier wit .
but be gentle .
shower her with compliments .
but be sincere .
and above all ...
you must control your temper !
here she is !
good evening .
well , where is she ?
who ?
oh .
the girl , yes .
the ... girl .
well , actually , she' s in the process of ...
circumstances being what they are ...
she' s not coming .
what ? !
but , your grace ... !
your eminence !
i thought i told you to come down to dinner !
i' m not hungry .
you come out , or i' il ...
i' il ...
i' il break down the door !
master ...
i could be wrong , but that may not be the best way to win the girl' s affections .
please attempt to be a gentleman .
but she is being so difficult .
gently , gently .
will you come down to dinner ?
no .
hmm ?
ah , ah , ah !
suave , genteel .
it would give me great pleasure if you would join me for dinner .
we say please .
please .
no , thank you !
you can' t stay in there forever !
yes , i can .
fine .
then go ahead and starve !
lf she doesn' t eat with me , then she doesn' t eat at all .
oh , dear .
that didn' t go very well at all , did it ?
lumiere , stand watch at the door and inform me at once if there is the slightest change .
you can count on me , mon capitan .
well , we might as well go downstairs and start cleaning up .
i ask nicely , but she refuses .
well , what does she want me to do ... beg ?
show me the girl .
well , the master' s really not so bad once you get to know him .
why don' t you give him a chance ?
i don' t want to get to know him .
i don' t want to have anything to do with him !
i don' t want to have anything to do with him !
i' m just fooling myself .
she' il never see me as anything ... but a monster .
it' s hopeless .
oh , no !
oh , yes !
oh , no !
oh , yes , yes , yes !
i' ve been burned by you before .
zut , alors !
she has emerged !
come on , chip , into the cupboard with your brothers and sisters .
come on , chip , into the cupboard with your brothers and sisters .
but i' m not sleepy .
yes , you are .
no , i' m not .
i work and i slave all day long and for what ?
a culinary masterpiece gone to waste .
oh , stop your grousing .
it' s been a long night for all of us .
well , if you ask me , she was just being stubborn .
after all , he did say please .
but if the master doesn' t learn to control that temper he' il never break ...

it' s my first time in an enchanted castle .
enchanted !
who said anything about the castle being enchanted ?
it was you , wasn' t it ?
i figured it out for myself .
i' d like to look around , if that' s all right .
oh , would you like a tour ?
wait a second , wait a second .
i' m not sure that' s such a good idea .
we can' t let her go poking around in certain places , if you know what i mean .
perhaps you' d like to take me .
i' m sure you know everything there is to know about the castle .
oh , well , actually , i , uh ...
yes , i do .
as you can see the pseudo facade was stripped away to reveal a minimalist rococo design .
note the unusual inverted vaulted ceilings .
this is yet another example of the late neoclassic baroque period . and , as i always say if it' s not baroque , don' t fix it .
uh , where was l ?
as you were .
now , then , if i may draw your attention to the flying buttresses above the ...
uh , mademoiselle ?
what' s up there ?
where ?
there ?
oh , nothing .
absolutely nothing of interest at all in the west wing .
dusty , dull , very boring .
ah , so that' s the west wing .
nice going .
i wonder what he' s hiding up there ?
hiding ?
the master is hiding nothing .
then it wouldn' t be forbidden .
perhaps , uh , mademoiselle would like to uh uh , uh ... see something else .
we have exquisite tapestries dating all the way back to ... maybe later .
th the gardens or or the the the the library , perhaps .
you have a library ?
yes , oh , indeed .
with books .
scads of books !
mountains of books !
forests of books !
cascades !
longboats !
swamps of books !
more books than you' il ever be able to read in a lifetime .
books on every subject ever studied , by every author who ever set pen to paper .
oh !
why did you come here ?
i' m ...
i' m sorry .
i warned you never to come here .
i didn' t mean any harm .
do you realize what you could have done ? !
please , stop .
get out !
no !
get ... out !
where are you going ?
promise or no promise
i can' t stay here another minute .
oh , no , wait , please .
please wait .
oh !
oh !
here now .
oh , don' t do that .
just hold still .
that hurts !
lf you' d hold still , it wouldn' t hurt as much !
well , if you hadn' t have run away this wouldn' t have happened !
lf you hadn' t frightened me , i wouldn' t have run away !
well , you shouldn' t have been in the west wing !
well , you should learn to control your temper !
now hold still .
this might sting a little .
hmm ?
by the way , thank you .
for saving my life .
you' re welcome .
i don' t usually leave the asylum in the middle of the night but he said you' d make it worth my while .
ah .
i' m listening .
it' s like this .
i' ve got my heart set on marrying belle but she needs a little ... persuasion .
turned him down flat .
everyone knows her father' s a lunatic .
he was in here tonight raving about a beast in a castle .
maurice is harmless .
the point is , belle would do anything to keep him from being locked up .
yeah .
even marry him .
so you want me to throw her father into the asylum unless she agrees to marry you .
oh , that is despicable .
i love it !
lf no one will help me then i' il go back alone .
yes , is that everything ?
i don' t care what it takes .
i' il find that castle , and somehow
i' il get her out of there .
belle ?
maurice ?
oh , well .
i guess it' s not going to work after all .
they have to come back sometime .
and when they do , we' il be ready for them .
lefou ... don' t move from that spot until belle and her father come home .
but , but , i ...
aw , nuts .
i' ve never felt this way about anyone .
i want to do something for her .
but what ?
well , there' s the usual things .
flowers , chocolates .
promises you don' t intend to keep .
ah , no , no .
it has to be something very special .
something that sparks her interest .
wait a minute !
belle , there' s something i want to show you .
but first , you have to close your eyes .
it' s a surprise .
can i open them ?
no , no .
not yet .
wait here .
now can i open them ?
all right .
now .
i can' t believe it !
i' ve never seen so many books in all my life !
you you like it ?
it' s wonderful !
then it' s yours .
oh , thank you so much .
oh , would you look at that !
i knew it would work .
what ?
what worked ?
it' s very encouraging .
lsn' t this exciting ?
i didn' t see anything .
come along , chip .
there' s chores to be done in the kitchen .
but what are they talking about ?
what' s going on ?
come on , mom .
there' s something sweet
and almost kind
but he was mean , and he was coarse and unrefined
and now he' s dear , and so unsure
i wonder why i didn' t see it there before
she glanced this way
i thought i saw
and when we touched , she didn' t shudder at my paw
no , it can' t be
i' il just ignore
but then she' s never looked at me that way before
new and a bit alarming
who' d have ever thought that this could be ?
true that he' s no prince charming
but there' s something in him
that i simply didn' t see ...
well , who' d have thought ?
well , bless my soul
well , who' d have known ?
well , who indeed ?
and who' d have guessed
they' d come together on their own ?
it' s so peculiar
we' il wait and see
a few days more
there may be something there that wasn' t there before ...
you know , perhaps there is
something there that wasn' t there before
what ?
there may be something there that wasn' t there before .
what' s there , mama ?
shh !
i' il tell you when you' re older .
tonight is the night .
i' m not sure i can do this .
you don' t have time to be timid .
you must be bold , daring .
bold , daring .
there will be music ... romantic candlelight ... provided by myself .
and when the moment is right you confess your love .
yes , i can ...
l i ...
no , i can' t .
you care for the girl , don' t you ?
more than anything .
well , then , you must tell her .
voila !
oh , you look so ... so ...
stupid .
not quite the word i was looking for .
perhaps a little more off the top ?
your lady awaits .
tale as old as time
true as it can be
barely even friends
then somebody bends
unexpectedly
just a little change
small , to say the least
both a little scared
neither one prepared
beauty and the beast
ever just the same
ever a surprise
huh ?
huh ?
huh ?
ever as before
ever just as sure
as the sun will rise
tale as old as time
tune as old as song
bittersweet and strange
finding you can change
learning you were wrong
certain as the sun
rising in the east
tale as old as time
song as old as rhyme
beauty and the beast
shh !
tale as old as time
song as old as rhyme
beauty and the beast .
off to the cupboard with you now , chip .
it' s past your bedtime .
good night , love .
belle ?
are you ... happy here with me ?
yes .
what is it ?
lf only i could see my father again just for a moment .
i miss him so much .
there is a way .
this mirror will show you anything ... anything you wish to see .
i' d like to see my father , please .
papa ?
oh , no .
he' s sick .
he may be dying and he' s all alone .
then , you must go to him .
what did you say ?
i release you .
you are no longer my prisoner .
you mean ...
i' m free ?
yes .
oh , thank you .
hold on , papa .
i' m on my way .
take it with you so you' il always have a way to look back and remember me .
thank you for understanding how much he needs me .
well , your highness , i must say everything is going just swimmingly .
i knew you had it in you .
i let her go .
yes , yes .
splen ...
you what ?
how could you do that ?
i had to .
yes , but ...
why ?
because ...
i love her .
he did what ?
yes .
i' m afraid it' s true .
she' s going away ?
but he was so close .
after all this time , he' s finally learned to love .
that' s it , then .
that should break the spell .
but it' s not enough .
she has to love him in return .
now it' s too late .
papa !
papa !
ooh .
they' re back .
belle ?
shh .
it' s all right , papa .
i' m home .
i thought i' d never see you again .
i missed you so much .
but the beast ?
did you ... how did you escape ?
i didn' t escape , papa .
he let me go .
that horrible beast ?
but he' s different now , papa .
he' s changed somehow .
hi .
oh .
a stowaway .
why , hello there , little fella .
didn' t think i' d see you again .
belle , why' d you go away ?
don' t you like us anymore ?
oh , chip , of course i do .
it' s just ...
may i help you ?
i' ve come to collect your father .
my father ?
don' t worry , mademoiselle .
we' il take good care of him .
my father' s not crazy .
he was raving like a lunatic .
we all heard him , didn' t we ?
no , i won' t let you .
belle ?
maurice , tell us again , old man .
just how big was the beast ?
he was ...
i mean , he was ... he was ... enormous .
l i' d say at least eight ...
no , more like ten feet .
well , you don' t get much crazier than that .
it' s true , i tell you .
get him out of here .
let go of me .
no !
you can' t do this .
poor belle .
it' s a shame about your father .
you know he' s not crazy , gaston .
hmm , i might be able to clear up this ...
little misunderstanding .
lf ...
lf what ?
lf you marry me .
what ?
one little word , belle .
that' s all it takes .
never .
have it your way .
belle .
let go of me .
my father' s not crazy and i can prove it .
show me the beast .
ls it dangerous ?
oh , no , no , he' d never hurt anyone .
please , i know he looks vicious , but he' s really kind and gentle .
he' s my friend .
lf i didn' t know better
i' d think you had feelings for this monster .
he' s no monster , gaston .
you are .
she' s as crazy as the old man .
the beast will make off with your children .
he' il come after them in the night .
no !
we' re not safe till his head is mounted on my wall .
i say we kill the beast !
we' re not safe until he' s dead
he' il come stalking us at night
set to sacrifice our children
to his monstrous appetite
he' il wreak havoc on our village
lf we let him wander free
so it' s time to take some action , boys
it' s time to follow me
through the mist , through the woods
through the darkness and the shadows
it' s a nightmare , but it' s one exciting ride
say a prayer , then we' re there at the drawbridge of a castle
and there' s something truly terrible inside
it' s a beast , he' s got fangs , razor sharp ones
massive paws , killer claws for the feast
hear him roar , see him foam
but we' re not coming home
till he' s dead
good and dead
kill the beast !
no , i won' t let you do this .
lf you' re not with us , you' re against us .
bring the old man .
get your hands off me .
we can' t have them running off to warn the creature .
let us out !
we' il rid the village of this beast .
who' s with me ?
raise your torch , mount your horse
screw your courage to the sticking place
we' re counting on gaston to lead the way
through the mist , through the wood
where , within a haunted castle
something' s lurking that you don' t see every day
it' s a beast , one as tall as a mountain
we won' t rest till he' s good and deceased
sally forth , tally ho
grab your sword , grab your bow
praise the lord , and here we go .
we' il lay siege to the castle and bring back his head !
i have to warn the beast .
this is all my fault .
oh , papa , what are we going to do ?
now , now .
we' il think of something .
ah !
we don' t like what we don' t understand
ln fact , it scares us
and this monster is mysterious at least
bring your guns , bring your knives
save your children and your wives
we' il save our village and our lives
we' il kill the beast !
i knew it .
i knew it was foolish to get our hopes up .
maybe it would have been better if she' d never come at all .
could it be ?
ls it she ?
sacre bleu !
lnvaders .
encroachers .
and they have the mirror .
warn the master .
lf it' s a fight they want , we' il be ready for them .
who' s with me ?
ah !
take whatever booty you can find but remember , the beast is mine !
lights ablaze , banners high
we go marching into battle
unafraid , although the danger just increased
raise the flag , sing the song
here we come , we' re 50 strong
and 50 frenchmen can' t be wrong
let' s kill the beast !
pardon me , master ?
leave me in peace .
but , sir , the castle is under attack .
kill the beast !
kill the beast !
this isn' t working .
oh , lumiere , we must do something .
wait , i know .
what shall we do , master ?
it doesn' t matter now .
just let them come .
kill the beast !
kill the beast !
kill the beast !
now !
yes !
here we go .
what the devil ?
belle , look out !
you guys got to try this thing .
up here you scurvy scum !
now !
oh !
and stay out !
eww !
get up .
get up !
what' s the matter , beast ?
too kind and gentle to fight back ?
no !
belle ...
no !
gaston , don' t !
let' s go , philippe .
come on out and fight !
were you in love with her , beast ?
did you honestly think she' d want you when she had someone like me ?
it' s over , beast .
belle is mine !
let me go .
let me go .
please , don' t hurt me .
i' il do anything .
anything !
get out .
beast !
belle ?
belle ?
you came back .
you ...
you came back .
of course i came back .
i couldn' t let them ...
oh , this is all my fault .
lf only i' d gotten here sooner .
maybe ... it' s better ... it' s better this way .
don' t talk like that .
you' il be all right .
we' re together now .
everything' s going to be fine .
you' il see .
and ... at least ...
i got to see you ... one last time .
no .
no .
please ...
please ...
please , don' t leave me .
i love you .
belle .
it' s me .
it is you .
lumiere .
cogsworth !
mrs. potts !
look at us .
mama , mama .
my goodness .
it is a miracle .
l' amour .
well , lumiere , old friend .
shall we let bygones be bygones ?
of course , mon ami .
i told you she would break the spell .
i beg your pardon , old friend but i believe i told you .
no , you didn' t i told you .
you most certainly did not you pompous , paraffin headed peabrain .
en garde , you you overgrown pocket watch .
take that .
are they going to live happily ever after , mama ?
of course , my dear .
of course .
do i still have to sleep in the cupboard ?
