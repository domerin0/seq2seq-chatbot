yes .
very cute .
five ?
four , when that picture was taken .
oh .
six now .
it was unfortunate about ...
aguilar .
but tough decisions do go with the job .
burden of command , correct ?
look .
these salutes , i' ve given them some thought .
technically , they are not a violation of regulations .
so , if the inmates can confine themselves to a simple ... hand movement through the hair ,
i see no problem with it .
and if the men want to call you chief , well , that' s fine .
free speech and all that .
okay , then .
no , not okay .
it' s too late , colonel .
it' s too late for what ?
for your offer .
the men don' t want to salute .
they don' t want to use rank .
they don' t want better food .
they don' t want more tv .
they just want your resignation .
so do i.
my resignation ?
you' re a disgrace , colonel .
a disgrace to the uniform .
you should not be allowed to retain your command .
well , then i' d better go pack .
i think you should .
oh ?
tell me , mr. irwin , what' s to stop me from just ... placing you in the hole ... for , say , six months ?
nothing .
if that' s the way you want to win .
sir , if i can make a suggestion ,
maybe we should isolate prisoner irwin  get me general wheeler .
yes , sir .
two weeks ago , i watched as he marched a man up and down the yard .
a minor eccentricity .
fine .
since then , he' s been acting as though ... he still has a command in some fantasy army .
and yesterday  i don' t think you' d want to make general .
now , you wouldn' t want to give up all these perks , would you ?
sorry .
go on .
yesterday , mr. irwin ... told me he required my resignation .
frankly , i think he' s started to lose the plot .
you saying he' s delusional ?
i' m saying he needs professional psychiatric help .
he' s sick and becoming pathetic .
uh , you might want to be a little more careful in your word choice .
that sick , pathetic man put this star on my shoulder .
yes , sir .
i know .
and i also know that you sat in on his court martial .
and don' t talk about things that are above your pay grade .
hmm ?
yes , sir .
general wheeler , i admire the man as much as you do .
so i want to see that he gets the best care possible .
and i' m not sure that this is the right place for that .
all right .
well , let me see him .
do we read the rules , sir ?
read ' em .
well , sir , normally for a contact visit , folks are limited to one embrace in the beginning and one at the end .
and , uh , hands must be visible at all times , also .
i guess that rules out the hand job .
thank you , gentlemen .
permission to be seated , sir .
permission granted .
what are you doing here , jim ?
i' m here to see if you ve lost your mind .
uh , he should be available later .
i can take a mes just a second .
good morning , miss kelly .
jim jim , yeah hold on  miss kelly ?
miss kelly , i got everything here but ...
the athletic gear .
i found that
i found that top one laying on the floor out in the hallway .
hold on one second .
what , danny ?
i found that top one ...
laying on the floor in the hallway .
fine .
thanks , danny .
uh , yeah .
we just needed you to send him up here as soon as possible .
he' s saying you' re delusional , that you' re acting as if you' re still in command of an army .
he' s saying i' m delusional because he wants me gone .
now , if you had ironclad evidence ... of winter killing a man in cold blood for no good reason , then i could do something , maybe .
outside of that , the man' s been investigated three times .
he' s been exonerated three times .
and as far as washington is concerned ,
he' s doin ' a superb job .
yeah , and you' re a convicted criminal .
you could get another investigation .
yes , i could .
but without any new evidence , what would be the point ?
and besides that , gene , honestly ,
i don' t give a rat' s ass .
i don' t care .
what i care about is you and getting you out of here .
now , haven' t you punished yourself enough ?
what i did was wrong , jim .
all teams .
all teams , this is a full s. o. r. t. alert .
all teams , this is a full s. o. r. t. alert .
i cannot let this continue .
now , you will get out of here , and you will go spend some time ... with your daughter and your grandson .
i can have my staff write up a compassionate release on medical grounds .
it can say whatever you want it to say .
there' s nothing wrong with me .
for christ' s sake , will you work with me ?
there is nothing wrong with me .
i see no indication of anything , sir .
of course not .
he' il keep it hidden until the last possible second .
red team , go .
go , go , go !
gene , what the hell is this about ?
is this about control ?
because , you know , no castle can have two kings .
go , go , go , go , go !
get down !
on the floor , now !
general , you must come with us .
what are you doing ?
all inmates remain on the ground in the prone position .
all inmates remain on the ground
let' s go !
what is this !
what is this for christ' s sake ?
go !
let' s go !
go , go , go , go !
all right !
sir ?
tear gas ?
return to hangar .
nothing is happening .
it was a bluff .
you can take her home .
return to hangar .
you thought he was gonna try to take me hostage ?
yes , it was a precautionary move .
what the hell kind of ... grab ass unit are you running here , colonel ?
sir , at 1 1 : 58 this morning , i received a letter ... stating a group of inmates were planning on taking you hostage at 1 2 : 1 0 .
i thought it prudent to act immediately to ensure your safety .
i' ve been hearing some disturbing things about what goes on in here .
and now i' m hearing it from a man i trust and whose opinion i respect .
may i speak freely , sir ?
yes , you may .
with all due respect , general ,
i don' t know what you may have been hearing .
but until you' ve spent some time in the yard with those animals , you have no idea what happens in there .
point taken , colonel .
nevertheless , if i hear ... one more story about a man dying under your command , you are through here .
do you understand me ?
yes , sir .
all right .
as far as gene irwin is concerned , it is my judgment he is as sane as you or i.
i wish he wasn' t .
he is .
frankly , i' d like nothing more than an excuse to get him out of here .
but i see the only way that' s gonna happen is if you request it .
that is true , sir .
so you just you tell me you can' t handle him .
he' s gone .
oh , i think i can handle him , sir .
you watch yourself , colonel .
eugene r. irwin , lieutenant general , united states army , in direct contravention of an order to evacuate burundi ... by his commander in chief
that is the president , for those of you who do not know . ... selected a platoon of men to extractjackson ngwe , a local warlord . disregarding reliable intelligence , general irwin' s reconnaissance team entered the ville at 0300 .
eight men were captured and executed .
disregarding ... reliable intelligence ... eight men ... were executed .
what i want you men to understand ... is what the consequences can be ... when you choose to follow a man who is motivated ... solely by his pride .
a man who will do anything for one more victory notch on his belt , no matter what the cost , before he fades away .
start the extractions .
over here !
come here !
let' s go .
get out !
get out !
hi , doc .
let' s go for a little walk .
get the fuck back !
open 355 !
open it up !
look at you .
relax , ladies .
hold him down , men !
i had nothing to do with this !
no !
uhh !
why don' t you just execute me ?
no reason for that !
turn him around .
don' t put me in the hole !
oh , don' t don' t put me in the hole !
no !
you want that ?
no .
thanks , man .
you bet .
what do we do now ?
jimmy , wait up !
attention , inmates .
all visitation requests must be submitted ... to thes 3by 1 100 today .
all visitation requests  so , you really did you really did bluff winter .
the problem is his flush beat your straight .
i don' t play poker , mr. yates .
i play chess .
and in chess , you play with somebody long enough , you come to realize that their first three moves are usually the same .
chess , huh ?
what was his first move ?
what was the first move ?
first , uh , two teams ,
20 men apiece .
like i was saying , the inside teams only have batons .
second ?
second ?
water cannon .
third ?
what kind of chopper ?
chopper .
sir , are you sure we should be having this discussion this man standing
you know he can' t be trusted , right ?
i don' t know .
is that how you use the burden of command ?
to make men into into , uh , chess pieces ?
yes .
hey , yates .
why don t you do yourself a favor and run along .
pawns .
that prisoner walking away , who is that ?
uh , that' s that' s yates .
he was an apache pilot , but now he' s a lowlife a hustler .
he takes bets .
on what ?
anything .
fights , the weather .
he even took bets on whether irwin was gonna kill himself .
classical ]
ahhh .
this highly effective officer seems to have no moral grounding whatsoever .
is that so ?
well , that' s what men better than me seem to think , sir .
why are you here , yates ?
i would like your version .
i was involved in a drug smuggling operation from juarez to el paso ... including several of my subordinates , sir .
you were involved .
you ran it , did you not ?
correct .
says here that you wore a wire on your men .
is that correct ?
yeah .
and how many years ... did they take off your sentence for ... that ?
four years , sir .
and now you' re the prison bookie .
tell me , yates , how does a man like you ... get into west point ?
my father was a winner of the congressional medal of honor , sir .
oh , right .
well , sometimes the apple does fall far from the tree .
your father
your father was a pow with mr. irwin , was he not ?
yes , that is correct .
and yet , you haven' t seen fit to join mr. irwin' s
crusade ?
crusade .
why is that ?
it' s not my fight .
mr. irwin is in a fight ?
it says here you have three years ...
left with us .
correct ?
that' s what it says .
that' s what it says .
does three months sound better ?
i need to resolve this situation ... quickly ... before someone else gets hurt ... or killed .
do you agree ?
i guess .
and the way i need to do that is with information .
so , you might want to rethink ... your joining mr. irwin' s ... crusade .
you asking me to be your snitch , sir ?
isn' t it a little late in the game to be self righteous ?
dude , why i got to get my ass kicked ?
how many times you gonna ask ?
stop your sniveling .
i' m only gonna hit you once .
well , when ?
now !
fight !
fight !
fight !
sit your tray down !
hey , fucker !
back off now !
i said back off now !
on your cans !
let' s get on !
sit your asses down , now !
let' s go !
you guys , we don' t have much time .
we can no longer wear the uniform of a soldier .
we forfeited that right .
and that includes me .
i disobeyed an executive order .
i violated my duty as a commanding officer .
and eight men paid a catastrophic price .
it' s a mistake not easy to live with .
so , here lam , just like you , a convicted criminal .
the only difference between you and me is i know i' m guilty .
so we' re packed away here as prisoners .
and one thing is certain .
our captors have the power .
they can try to humiliate us .
they can beat us .
they can lock us away in a dark hole for days on end .
but there' s one thing they cannot do .
they cannot take away from us who we are .
and we are soldiers .
yeah , that' s right .
it is the one thing it is the one thing that gives us a chance in here .
and that nobody can ever take away .
yeah , that' s right .
the uniform code of military justice .
grounds for removal of a stockade or disciplinary barracks commander :  one .
dereliction of duty .
that' s right .
yeah .  two .
criminal malfeasance .
noncompliance with procedural rules .
yeah . four .
making false official statements . five .
conduct unbecoming to an officer and gentleman .
yeah ! six .
cruelty and maltreatment of persons under his command .
seven .
command failure resulting in loss of control of facility .
gentlemen , i propose that we seize control of this facility .
take a look at a castle , any castle .
now , break down the elements that make it a castle .
location .
protection .
garrison .
flag .
the only difference between this castle and all the rest ...
is they were built to keep people out .
forward .
ho .
this castle was built to keep people in .
but it' s still a castle .
and any castle can be taken , whether you' re fighting in the 14th century or the 21 st .
to succeed in a castle war , you have to overcome the garrison , take the high ground ... and ultimately capture the flag .
okay ?
enriquez .
all right .
you set up a command post , okay ?
and here , you have the guard well , here .
first of all , this is admin building ,
winter' s office , guards .
okay ?
phase one , neutralize winter' s guards .
phase two , towers .
control the towers , you control the yard .
tower one , tower two , tower three , tower four .
tower four is zamorro guy to watch .
phase three , water cannon .
four , helicopter .
helicopter' s the high ground .
takin ' the helicopter' s gonna be a bitch .
but it' s doable .
finally , the flag .
capture the flag .
when we capture the flag , it' s raised upside down .
distress .
right .
right .
upside down means , send help .
the fort has fallen .
we raise it upside down , and keep it that way until wheeler arrives and sees it .
then , we' ve won .
yates , shut the fu you see what i mean about him ?
hey , yates , what are you doin ' here , huh ?
i don' t know .
ask him .
he invited me .
general , i know , uh , his father served with you in vietnam , but do we really need him around ?
yeah .
he stays .
duffy ?
are you in maintenance ?
yes , sir .
yates .
got a minute ?
how am i doin ' ?
five to two , in the colonel' s favor .
well , you don' t think i can win .
he knows too
he knows too much .
he' s prepared .
he' s ready .
he may be prepared , but he' s not ready .
you know , we can use you .
hey , look , i just want to survive this and go home .
you make a deal with him ?
what ?
that' s what i would do .
go to you .
he knows what you re capable of .
listen , man .
but so do i.
oh , yeah ?
well , i know what you' re capable of .
i know your type very well .
is that right ?
is that from your infinite years of experience on the battlefield ?
why do you think i should help you ?
can you get me out of here ?
no .
then what are you going to do for me ?
oh , you' re going to make me a soldier again ?
is that what you re doing ?
i get to be all i can be ?
you gonna teach me to salute ?
you know what ?
this is about the time i would be giving you my internal soldier speech .
but the truth is , you probably never should have been a soldier .
your father was .
that' s how i saw him .
you saw him as a disappointment .
okay .
get past it .
that was then .
the only thing that matters here is ... what we are now and what we do now .
this man is going to you because he sees the worst in you .
he' s going to play for the worst .
i want to see the best .
that means there' s no middle .
now , these men need you .
and i need you .
now , it' s your choice .
and don' t tell me you' re surviving here , yates .
you' re hiding .
how' s it going this evening , sir ?
fine , sergeant .
how are you ?
sir ?
prisoner yates wishes to have a word .
give me five minutes , captain .
hi .
hi .
colonel winter' s office .
yeah .
yeah , go ahead and just send it up .
sir .
sir ?
yes .
prisoner yates .
you want me to do this thing for you ?
this 30 days this three months , it' s not gonna cut it .
i got to get out of here immediately .
i got to get out of here tomorrow .
i' m afraid that' s not possible .
look , when this thing explodes , everyone' s gonna know it' s me who yakked .
and then my life' s worth nothing .
so , either you get me out of here immediately ... or you find another guy who knows as much as i do ... and who' s willing to spill it .
good luck .
the soonest i can get you out is one week .
sir , i' m not gonna last
i won' t last seven seconds let alone seven days .
well , you can ride the week out in the hole .
no one will get you there .
so what does mr. irwin have planned for us ?
he' s planning to take over the prison .
really .
well , that information won' t get you released .
that information won' t even get you extra potatoes at lunch .
i know the details .
i know how he plans to neutralize your men , how he plans to take over the tower , weapons and tools he' s building .
do you know when ?
yates , i know you' re in there !

a great general once said , you tell your men , ' you' re soldiers . that' s our flag . ' you tell them , ' nobody takes our flag . ' raise your flag so it flies high where everyone can see it .
now you' ve got yourself a castle .
where the years have gone i have years to go
workin ' for the man to pay the debt i owe
well , the time may pass but the truth will stand
when the good lord shakes this calloused hand
you can call my name it' s time to go
but i' il never be free till it' s chiseled in stone
ain' t no man gonna carry my load
i gotta be a man and do it on my own
devil' s in my path and the hound' s on my heel
have to walk in my shoes just to know how i feel
the devil' s callin ' my name he' s the one who knows
that i' il never be free till it' s chiseled in stone
chiseled in stone
well , i keep ongoin ' though there' s no way out
every stone in my path is a brick in my house
a man' s life is built all along the way
by the things that he' s done and the choices he' s made
someday they' il call my name i' il have a place of my own
but i' il never be free till it' s chiseled in stone
on the final day when the whistle blows
i can rest my body i can rest my soul
i built my castle in the promised land
it' s made of rocks and stone and like the shifting sands
when they mention my name after i' m long gone
well , they' il know i' m free ' cause it' s chiseled in stone
chiseled in stone .
