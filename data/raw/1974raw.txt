they called it the car for everyman .
henry ford himself called it a car for the " great multitude .
it was functional and simple , like your sewing machine or your cast iron stove .
you could learn to drive it in less than a day , and you could get any color you wanted , so long as it was black .
when ford first conceived the model t , it took 13 hours to assemble .
within five years , he was turning out a vehicle every 90 seconds .
of course , the real invention wasn' t the car , it was the assembly line that built it .
pretty soon , other businesses had borrowed the same techniques .
seamstresses became button sewers .
furniture makers became knob turners .
it was the beginning and the end of imagination ... all at the same time .
howard ?
charles , i' m talking to you .
hmm ?
they need spokes , same as the others .
they oughta make a better spoke .
yeah ?
then what would you do ?
it was a land of opportunity .
the country was shrinking , and there was life to be made out west ... for any man with drive and ambition .
if your dream was big enough and you had the guts to follow it , there was truly a fortune to be made .
how are you , sir ?
damn thing blew on me .
what ?
it' s a stanley steamer .
the boiler blew .
oh ?
can you fix it ?
uh ...
sure .
sure , i can fix it .
this is an amazing machine .
it' s got a two stroke boiler system ... that' s heated by this huge fire grate .
i mean , it' s ...
well , it' s basically a very small locomotive .
thank you .
now , i made some improvements .
it wasn' t your boiler that was blowing ; it was your bleed valve .
so , with increased pressure , i can see you getting up to 40 miles an hour .
really ?
oh , yeah .
and if you superheat the excess , i can see you reaching ...
fifty , maybe 60 miles an hour .
is that right ?
easily .
and the thing of it is , mr. coughlin , you don' t feed it , you don' t stable it , and unless you hit a lamppost , the thing' s not gonna get sick and die on ya .
that' s funny .
to tell you the truth ,
i wouldn' t spend more than five dollars on the best horse in america .
this is not the finish line , my friends .
this is the start of the race .
the future is the finish line !
and the new buick white streak is just the car to take us there !
four in line cylinders , 421/ 2 horsepower ,
wonderful .
this is the same car you can buy at any of our five showrooms across the bay area .
" the age of the automobile is here , " boasted howard . " the future has arrived .
oh , my .
read the part about the future again .
oh , i' m kind of dealing with it right now .
oh , sorry .
here .
i' il take him .
come here , big guy .
come here .
come here .
oh , are you the future , huh ?
are you the future ?
are you gonna ...
are you going to the moon ?
the moon !
whee !
i' il take it .
do we really need all this ?
no .
no .
we don' t need it ...
there' s also a caretaker' s house , a paddock , a barn , some very nice stables .
how big are the stables ?
got it .
settle down .
settle down .
quit .
quit .
whoa .
whoa .
whoa .
whoa .
come on , dad .
whoa .
there you go .
you' re not getting him a horse .
why not ?
he' s great at it .
because he' s 16 years old .
so ?
so ... he should earn it .
all right .
all ...
all right .
quiet .
everybody knows it .
nobody knows longfellow .
dickinson .
ooh !
we never know how high we are ...
oh , i know that .
yeah .
i know .
i know it .
well ?
we never know how high we are till we are called to rise .
good .
very good , john .
and then , if we are true to plan , our statures touch the skies .
excellent .
yes !
that' s really good .
uh oh .
" the heroism ...
right .
right . " the heroism ...
the heroism we recite ...
would be a daily thing ,
that' s it .
did not ourselves the cubits warp , for fear to be a king .
you should be riding it .
you knew the poem .
yeah .
but he looks so perfect out there , doesn' t he ?
yeah .
he does .
that' s the poetry right there , agnes .
that' s the poetry .
thank you .
thank you for coming .
i came here 15 years ago with 21 cents in my pocket .
i know a lot of us at the table have a story like that .
and , you know , i can' t help thinking ... that if we can start out there and end up here , where can' t we go in america ?
hmm ?
so , as corny as it sounds , i' d like to propose a toast to the future .
because out here , my friends , the sky is literally the limit .
to the future !
to the future !
to the future !
there were no suicides on wall street that day .
it was a myth that would grow over time .
the real effect of october 29 took a little longer to sink in .
by noon , all the gains of the previous year had been obliterated .
by 4 : 00 p .
m. , nearly $10 billion of market value was gone .
over the next two weeks , the hemorrhage continued .
and before long , 25 % of the workforce was unemployed .
a great national migration began .
their automobile .
and all at once , millions of americans ... had a new definition of home .
i made two dollars today .
what ?
i made two dollars .
here .
where did you get these ?
yeah , your boy combed ' em out , changed all the tack .

at a time when the world really needed a drink , you couldn' t get one in the united states of america .
liquor was illegal .
diversions were scarce , and there' s just so much a human being can do without .
soon , the border town was born , providing everything to the south that their neighbor to the north would not .
food , companionship , decent gin , and with gambling outlawed as well ,
the chance to turn bad luck into good .
relax !
you got it !
you got it !
you got it !
go !
that jockey was ridin ' like he' s got an anvil in his pocket .

yeah .
i thought he came down here for a ...

it was in the palace of the great sultan .
sultan of where ?
the sultan of araby .
i' d been living there for almost a year , racing his arabians across the desert by day ... and finishing my personal history of the region by night .
then one day , the sultan summons me into his throne room .
he looks at me and says ,
" john pollard ...
" john pollard , you are my greatest jockey .
it is you i have chosen to ride my hundred mile race from kusmat to tripoli .
200 mile .
all right .
200 mile .
excuse me , sahib .
you didn' t need to wreck it , georgie .
when you started tellin ' that story , it was only 50 miles .
yeah , well , everything gets longer in the retellin ' .
just ask your friend wanda over there .
you know , if you start ridin ' a little more and talkin ' a little less , you might start winnin ' some races .
i got two bucks says i beat you in this one .

i' m fine , george .
i don' t need your help , and i sure as shit don' t need your charity .
leave me alone , all right ?
it' s been 20 years since i' ve been on a horse .
don' t worry .
it' s the kind of thing that comes right back .
let' s go .
come on !
what ?
she got you back up on a horse , and now you wanna buy ' em ?
yeah .
maybe .
maybe a couple .
you wanna win or just own ' em ?
i wanna win .
what sort of question is that ?
well , you' re gonna need a trainer before you buy horses .
no .
you need two .
so you can fire one , eh ?
randy thatcher' s barn .
trains about 50 or 60 ponies .
good fella too .
real horse person .
a real horse shitter .
scusa .
now , now .
i don' t know .
maybe you want a smaller barn , somebody who can take the time to ...
who' s that ?
huh ?
oh , he' s a crackpot .
lives alone in the bushes .
what' s he do ?
i don' t know .
he used to be a trainer , farrier .
now he just looks after that horse .
come on .
let' s look at another barn .
howdy .
hello .
wh ...
you hungry ?
no .
no , thanks .
i' m fine .
charles howard .
tom ...
smith .
nice to meet you , tom .
what' s ...
what' s in his bandage ?
oh , that' s hawthorn root .
it increases circulation .
you wanna sit down ?
oh .
all right .
thank you .
will he get better ?
already is ... a little .
will he race ?
no .
not that one .
so why are you fixing him ?
' cause i can .
every horse is good for somethin ' .
he could be a cart horse or a lead pony .
and he' s still nice to look at .
you know , you don' t throw a whole life away ... just ' cause he' s banged up a little .
is that coffee ?
yeah .
it' s bad , though .
you always tell the truth ?
well , i try to .
it ain' t just the speed .
it' s the heart .
you want something that' s not afraid to compete .
half these horses are just show ponies .
you want something that' s not gonna run from a fight .
how do you find that ?
look , i won the robles handicap .
i was second in the tijuana derby .
i won the manzanita oaks .
you know , that used to be a stakes race .
i know .
i would' ve won t. j. , but the piece of shit lugged out on me .
sounds great .
we' il let ya know .
look .
i can work ' em out in the morning .
or even hot walk ' em if you need me to .
really ?
you' il hot walk ' em ?
this is somethin ' else .
a dream come true , walkin ' you around .
hook you up to a plow , pull me around for a little while .
come on .
you ever run in the money ?
huh ?
hey .
hey .
you ever run in the money ?
i don' t think so .
couldn' t beat a human being , let alone another horse .
you goddamn sack of crap old plater .
probably the fastest you' re gonna run in your entire life , you piece of shit old glue pot .
that' s right .
the first time he saw seabiscuit , the colt was walking through the fog at 5 : 00 in the morning .
smith would say later that the horse looked right through him ... as if to say , " what the hell are you looking at ?
who do you think you are ?
he was a small horse , barely 15 hands .
he was hurting too .
there was a limp in his walk , a wheezing when he breathed .
smith didn' t pay attention to that .
he was looking the horse in the eye .
god ... damn .
he was the son of hard tack , sired by the mighty man o ' war .
but the breeding did little to impress anyone at claiborne farms .
get rid of him .
at six months , he was shipped off to train with the legendary trainer sunny fitzsimmons , who , over time , developed a similar opinion of the colt .
is that a racehorse or a lead pony ?
the judgment wasn' t helped by his gentle nature .
where his sire had been a fierce , almost violent competitor ,
seabiscuit took to sleeping for huge chunks of the day ... and enjoyed lolling for hours under the boughs of the juniper trees .
his other great talent was eating .
though half the size of other colts , seabiscuit could frequently eat twice as much .
fitzsimmons decided the horse was lazy ... and felt sure he could train the obstinance out of him .
i want you to hit him as many times as you can over a quarter of a mile .
when he didn' t improve , they decided the colt was incorrigible .
they made him a training partner to better horses , forcing him to lose head to head duels ... to boost the confidence of the other animal .
by the time he was three years old ,
seabiscuit was struggling in two cheap claiming races a week .
soon he grew as bitter and angry as his sire hard tack had been .
he was sold for the rock bottom price of $2, 000 .
and , of course , it all made sense .
champions were large , they were sleek , they were without imperfection .
when they finally did race him , he did just what they had trained him to do .
he lost .
what exactly is it you like ?
he' s got spirit .
i' il say .
can ...
can he be ridden ?
oh , sure .
eventually .
he can be a little touchy .
yeah , i got it .
no .
really .
i' m fine .
jesus christ !
that horse is nuts !
come on !
come on !
come on !
let' s go !
come on , you sons of bitches !
let' s go !
come on !
let' s go !
come on , you sons of bitches !
i' il take all of you !
come on !
come on !
it' s okay .
i' m not afraid of you .
sure .
i know .
i know what you' re all about .
you hungry ?
huh ?
yeah .
bet you are .
huh ?
come on .
come on , boy .
yeah .
why don' t you just breeze him around one turn .
give the folks a look .
right .
red pollard , mr. and mrs. howard .
yeah .
hi .
hello .
well , we' il just be movin ' on .
does he breeze ?
well , we' il find out .
seems pretty fast .
yeah .
in every direction .
hell , he' s so beat up , it' s hard to tell what he' s like .
i just can' t help feelin ' they got him ... so screwed up runnin' in a circle , he' s forgotten what he was born to do .
he just needs to learn how to be a horse again .
well , how do you do that ?
how far do you want me to take him ?
till he stops .
okay .
that seems like a pretty good ride .
hope so .
that' s it , boy .
you' re all right .
let' s see what you got , boy .
ha !
ha !
ha !
ha !
whoo !
that' s it , boy .
that' s it !
yeah !
whoo !
whoo hoo !
well , at least he wasn' t expensive .
no .
that' s true .
whoo !
goddamn it !
you' re an amazing animal !
whoo !
you can come inside , you know .
i' m fine .
thank you .
yeah , you look it .
no , really , i' m fine .
okay .
suit yourself .
welcome .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
it' s okay .
oh , i' m not that hungry .
mmm .
sure you' re not .
it' s just a lot of food .
it' s okay .
rather have you strong than thin .
they called it " relief , " but it was a lot more than that .
n. r. a. , w. p. a. , the c. c. c.
but it really came down to just one thing .
for the first time in a long time , someone cared .
for the first time in a long time , you were no longer alone .
goat racing ?
oh , no .
just trying to calm him down a little .
smart ones hate being alone all the time .
oh .
and sometimes another animal , it just ... just soothes them a bit .
pretty quiet in there .
what' d you do ?
go take a look .
oh .
# rock of ages , cleft for me #
# i am hid and safe in thee #
# for the water and the blood #
# from thy riven ... #
okay .
you don' t break him or anything , but we gotta see what he' s got .
you take him to the 5 pole ... and turn him loose .
turn him loose ?
yeah , son .
he' s a racehorse .
ha !
ha !
come on !
come on !
ha !
come on !
i know you got more than this !
let' s show ' em , boy !
how' s he look ?
asleep .
come on !
let' s show ' em , pops !
come on !
whoo !
there it is !
yeah !
whoo !
oh , my .
yeah , you and me !
let' s go !
whoo !
whoo hoo !
boy .
fast ?
oh .
yeah .
how fast ?
your horse just broke the track record at tanforan .
sometimes they ... they just , uh , hanker for a little competition .
as long as we' re talkin ' long shots , i got a real doozy for you , folks .
we got a horse that' s going off at 70 to 1 , and that' s a short price , my friends .
this horse couldn' t win a church raffle , let alone a $2, 000 allowance .
yeah , talk about a jump in class .
this is the skunk of the garden party .
yes , he' s the surprise in the punch bowl .
as a matter of fact , i' il lay even money that this nag , seabiscuit , couldn' t even finish six furlongs .
this is tick tock mcglaughlin live at clockers ' corner .
wow .
i wanted maroon .
they only had bright red .
oh , it looks great .
you don' t think the " h " is too big ?
you seen the size of our jockey ?
come on .
okay .
favorite' s that gray over there .
he' s got a big late charge , so lock in early with him and stay right off his flank .
okay .
once our boy sees who the competition is , he' il do most of the work .
but don' t move till that gray does .
what if it' s late ?
let' s go .
twelve minutes to post .
i don' t think it' s gonna matter much .
honestly .
come on in .
number 3 , pollard on seabiscuit .
hey , sahib .
kinda small , isn' t he ?
gonna look a lot smaller in a second , georgie .
i got five bucks says he doesn' t .
starter' s poised .
the flag is up .
and there they go .
pirate' s gold breaks first , followed by geronimo on the outside .
silver treasure is third , followed by seabiscuit .
they' re coming by the five furlong pole .
it' s pirate' s gold , geronimo , hill' s army and agua dulce .
whoa !
son of a bitch !
ha !
ha !
piece of shit bastard !
what the hell is he doing ? ... opening up a 3 ... a 4 length lead ...
let' s go !
what are you doing ?
i' m gonna put you on the rail , you piece of shit !
get off of me !
how do you like that , you son of a bitch ?
you' re gonna drop me , man !
the two horses are flying down ...
you like the rail ?
here comes the cavalry charge !
knock me off my horse !
it' s silver treasure on the inside .
silver treasure on the inside .
silver treasure and pirate' s gold .
and at the wire it' s silver treasure .
aw , damn it .
what the hell were you thinkin ' ?
he fouled me .
what am i supposed to do , let him get away with that ?
well , yeah , when he' s 40 to 1 .
he almost put me in the rail !
well , did he ?
look , we had a plan .
he fouled me , tom !
what am i supposed to do ?
he cut me off !
he fouled me !
son ?
son .
what are you so mad at ?
there' s a phone next door .
we' il call you .
every couple of weeks , we' il call you and tell you where we are .
no .
we' re just gonna go home .
all right ?
you have a gift .
you have a gift .
i need to borrow some money .
all right .
i , uh ,
i haven' t been to a dentist , and m ...
well , l i need to borrow some money .
that' s fine .
i don' t know when i can pay you back .
i mean , when we win .
when we win , i can pay you back .
that is if you still want me to ride .
of course i want you to ride .
how much do you need ?
uh , ten dollars .
here .
than ...
uh ...
it' s fine .
thank you .
i really appreciate it .
that' s it , pops .
we' re okay now .
it' s all right , boy .
yeah , we' re okay .
nothing to worry about .
all the time in the world , boy .
that' s it , pops .
nice lead .
just like that , boy .
just like that .
what do you think , boy ?
you ready to go ?
you and me .
let' s go , boy .
let' s go .
ha !
ha !
ha !
ha !
whoo !
in the end , it wasn' t the dams ... or the roads or the bridges or the parks .
or the tunnels or the thousands of other public projects ... that were built in those years .
it was more invisible than that .
men who were broken only a year before ... suddenly felt restored .
men who' d been shattered suddenly found their voice .
well , i just think this horse has a lot of heart .
he may have been down , but he wasn' t out .
he may have lost a few , but he didn' t let it get to him .
we could all learn a lick or two from this little guy .
oh , and by the way , he doesn' t know he' s little .
he thinks he' s the biggest horse out there .
so you got big plans for this little horse ?
oh , yeah .
see , sometimes when the little guy , he doesn' t know he' s a little guy , he can do great big things .
can we get a shot here ?
see , this isn' t the finish line .
the future is the finish line , and the biscuit is just the horse to get us there .
just the horse to get us there .
you certainly made a believer out of me , mr. howard .
it' s time for this old tout to eat some crow .
four and 20 blackbirds , to be exact , all baked up in some humble pie , and i' il take mine la mode .
oh .
and one more thing , mr. howard .
i just wanna say ...
thanks for the champagne .
don' t mention it .
did you see the infield ?
no , not yet .
take a look .
your little horse is sellin ' out the cheap seats .
