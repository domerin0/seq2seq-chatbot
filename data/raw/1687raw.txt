around 500 metres .
and , first he thinks it' s a truck or a semi trailer or something coz the light' s really bright , like glowing orange and shit .
yeah .
but as he gets closer he realizes the lights about 10 metres off the ground , it' s hanging in mid air .
so he' s scared .
he' s freaking out .
and then he hears this crack .
like an explosion .
that was supposed to scare us .
i know , it' s not scary .
alright , but he did .
he heard this crack .
like an explosion , of a jet .
and it just took off into the sky .
straight up like a rocket .
and then as soon as it was gone , his car just stopped in the middle of the road .
and it was totally silent , and he was just sitting there .
staring up at the stars .
in the middle of nowhere .
hey !
for no reason , just stopped .
is that a true story ?
absolutely !
he' s got something ..
you' ve got something dripping off the side of your lip there .
