matayan !
matayan !
in september 1600 , the tragic battle of sekigahara ended with ...
matayan !
matayan !
matazo !
takeyan !
matazo !
takeyan !
i' m still alive !
i won' t die !
i won' t die !
matayan !
don' t die in vain !
where are you hurt ?
where are you hurt ?
my thigh .
a spear got me .
bear it !
it' s not that bad .
bear it !
matayan !
can you stand ?
i can do it !
what are you doing ?
you must be one of the scavengers who search soldiers corpses for valuables .
akemi , let' s go .
akemi , let' s go .
okay .
mother , is it alright ?
what is ?
what is ?
hiding them here .
we have nothing to worry about .
they' re still greenhorns .
but , what if during our absence ...
afraid they will come looking for defeated soldiers ?
we will worry about it when the time comes .
takeyan !
you' re so fortunate .
you' re so fortunate .
why ?
you didn' t get hurt .
i might get a limp .
you fool !
all who sided with the toyotomi are social outcasts now !
it is the tokugawa' s world from now .
who got me into this ... ?
takeyan , you' re to blame !
you' re right .
you' re right .
that' s right !
if you hadn' t asked me , i wouldn' t have come here .
you said even a squire' s son could prosper if he could just take the head of a captain .
you fooled me !
i was fooled into coming with you !
look what happened !
such a hopeless battle !
you are to blame for everything !
stop brooding .
it was just a dream ...
like a dream , it ended !
we were just unlucky .
i don' t think that we' il see another great battle .
we were born too late .
i left home without telling anyone .
and otsu ...
i think i' m losing my mind !
otsu !
i wonder what otsu' s doing now .
otsu !
otsu !
they might hear us .
you' re not alone .
i have an elder sister waiting for my return , too ...
sister ...
shinmen takezo hon' iden matahachi
otsu san ...
do you dream of matahachi ?
yes , many times .
then , he' s dead ...
i also dream of my younger brother .
granny !
this is bad luck !
how foolish !!
your takezo tricked my son into going off to battle !
ogin , listen to me .
takezo might be satisfied !
but my matahachi was a very , very precious heir for the hon' iden !
i can' t afford for matahachi to die !
he won' t die !
he can' t die !
right , otsu ?
takezo is the god of ill fortune for the hon' iden family !
matayan , get a hold of yourself .
and get well soon .
we have no choice .
let' s go home and be farm squires again .
how will we face them ?
i' il apologize to granny and to otsu .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
washing it with alcohol .
go help out akemi .
this is awful .
listen .
you must bear the pain .
missus !
bear it !
missus !
what are you looking at , takezo san ?
the coming winter .
winter ?
it' s depressing .
when mount ibuki turns white , we live like bagworms .
we just wait till spring .
i don' t get it ?
i don' t get it ?
what ?
akemi chan , why do you and your mother live so dangerously ?
we can' t make a living by selling moxa only .
besides , mother is a widow to the chief of the bandits .
the top one in ibuki shichigo .
so , akemi chan is one of them ?
i' m just a child of the wilderness .
i was just raised by them .
then , you have to find a good husband .
hey , you know what ?
what ?
what ?
who my husband is ?
how would i know ?
don' t worry !
it' s not you , takezo san !
akemi chan .
akemi chan .
what ?
why do you have that bell on your sleeve ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
don' t know ?
funny , you have it on .
but i didn' t put it on .
my mother did .
i' ve had it on as long as i can remember .
i grew up listening to the bell .
doesn' t it sound beautiful ?
i sewed these for you .
which print do you like better ?
what' s wrong ?
what' s wrong ?
i hate my mother !
i hate matahachi san , too !
i hate all of you !
where are you going , takeyan ?
where are you going , takeyan ?
never mind .
let' s walk .
never mind ?
you' re acting so strange .
matayan , let' s go home .
go home ?
go home ?
right now .
without telling the family ?
i think it' s best .
no way .
i have my conveniences .
they did so much for me .
they did so much for me .
i' m getting scared .
matayan , otsu san is waiting .
your granny is also waiting .
you are fully recovered now .
matayan , let' s go home !
okay !
takeyan .
you go home first .
i' il leave later on .
takezo san !
matahachi san !
my mother will be killed !
damn you !
she used her daughter to steal valuables off the corpses at sekigahara !
she kept all the profits !
i heard all about it !
everyone !
search the house !
everyone !
search the house !
okay !
search carefully !
see , i told you !
according to bandit rules , take it all !
she' il serve as an example !
go strangle her !
an intruder !
he must be a straggler from sekigahara !
get him !
wait !
wait !
mata san !
let' s run away !
run ?
run ?
yes !
they won' t give up so easy .
he always wanted to get me anyway .
that man ?
that man ?
now is our chance to run !
we will live in another province !
okay !
we' il live together !
okay ?
but ...
what' s takeyan doing ?
takeyan !
takeyan !
never mind !
i don' t care about him !
i don' t like him !
akemi , you feel the same , don' t you ?
hurry !
get ready !
hurry !
i won' t let you go !
matayan , i did it !
matahachi !
i did it !
matayan !
matahachi !
oh , no !
matahachi !
matahachi !
matahachi !
you fool !
what will you do about otsu ?
priest takuan !
oh , otsu san ?
getting ready for the festival tomorrow ?
yes .
what are you doing there ?
we are celebrating buddha' s birth tomorrow .
it' s a very auspicious holiday .
i am washing off the lice into the river , because tomorrow i intend to be a bit of a dandy !
you' re so funny , takuan san !
if you spot a straggler from the battle of sekigahara , you must report it immediately .
hey .
hey !
wait !
damn it !
rifles , fire !
to worshipers ... we are just a poor temple .
please be generous with your offerings .
you can never donate too much .
takuan san .
takuan san .
yes .
please don' t demand offerings .
i' m directing my preachings to the wealthy .
lightening their load is part of piety .
hey !
hey !
young lad !
you can' t be popular with women like that .
you can' t be popular with women like that .
fool .
takuan san , please stop that or i' il really get angry .
oh , granny hon' iden .
what is it ?
what is it ?
have you paid your respects ?
to who ?
to who ?
your son , matahachi .
he will never die !
takezo can die , but not our matahachi !
right , otsu ?
move !
everyone gather around !
move !
hey !
be silent !
attention villagers !
i' m a vassal from himeji castle .
aoki tanzaemon is my name .
a few days ago ... a man of this village named shinmen takezo ... slipped past our checkpoint !
he is an offspring of shinmen munisai !
in the sekigahara battle ... he sided with the toyotomi .
i' m wondering where he' s hiding ?
we' ve yet to find any trace of him .
therefore , an investigative team will be established .
we must find him at all costs !
all villagers must cooperate with us .
and anyone who aids him shall be severely punished .
understood ?
otsu , did you hear that ?
if takezo has returned ... then matahachi might also have returned .
okay , let' s go .
gon san !
gon san !
gonroku !
gonroku !
did matahachi return ?
did matahachi return ?
what ?
i don' t know .
granny ...
granny ...
what ?
maybe we should go to ogin san' s ...
they are siblings !
she might know !
ogin dono ...
i heard the devil is back .
call him here .
you know who i mean .
it' s takezo !
you' re hiding him somewhere !
no .
no .
it' s obvious !
you must be hiding him somewhere !
you must be hiding him somewhere !
that' s not true !
he hasn' t returned !
if he had returned , he would come to see me .
you had an old woman come all the way here !
yet you have the gall to deny it !
he' s there !
takezo !
so , he was here after all .
ogin !
remember this !
hey otsu !
we don' t want to get involved .
let' s go .
let' s go .
but ...
i see .
you keep watch here .
granny , i' il get a lantern .
no need !
i' m the granny of hon' iden !
i am not so senile that i need a lantern !
old woman !
wait a moment !
did you just leave the shinmen residence ?
yes , that' s right .
are you a shinmen ?
are you a shinmen ?
hardly !
i' m a squire retiree from across the river !
i see .
then , you' re the famous hon' iden granny ?
that' s right .
you poor thing !
why do you say that ?
why do you say that ?
i heard matahachi died at sekigahara .
but don' t worry .
i' il take your revenge for sure .
sir , i know a good way of capturing takezo .
lend me your ears .
which one is takezo' s sister ?
which one is takezo' s sister ?
don' t be rude as i' m a woman living alone .
it' s this one .
seize her !
it' s this one .

what are you doing ?
so rough !
otsu san !
take her !
take her !
yes , sir !
just remain quiet , okay !
oh !
otsu san .
excuse me ?
where' s the bath ?

we found takezo !
priest , did you see takezo ?
priest , did you see takezo ?
i know nothing !
hey !
hey !
he' s over this way !
hurry !
let' s go !
dear ancestors ... people say matahachi is dead .
but i cannot believe that .
unlike the cowardly takezo ...
he has lost in battle and is too ashamed to face us .
my son , otsu ...
is waiting to give you these clothes that she made .
return home soon ... and show granny your cheerful face .
granny ...
who is it ?
you' re ... ?
granny , i came to see you .
what ?
why did you return alone ?
what happened to matahachi ?
what happened to matahachi ?
granny , matahachi is alive .
he' s not dead .
he' s living with a woman in another province .
matahachi !
with another woman !
please tell otsu san .
granny , please tell her !
now i feel better .
since i told you this , i have no other business in this village .
takezo .
where are you going now ?
first , i plan to ... see my sister and then i intend to leave miyamoto village .
granny , i won' t see you again .
wait !
takezo ...
aren' t you hungry ?
haven' t eaten for days .
poor soul ...
i have dinner almost ready .
don' t hesitate .
your family and mine have been friends since the days of the akamatsu clan .
parting will be hard .
please go ahead .
hurry !
hurry around the back .
someone may see you .
i' il check the bath .
granny !
gon !
gon !
takezo' s back .
takezo' s back .
takezo !
quiet !
go tell the officers .
takezo ?
how' s the water temperature ?
it' s a good bath , granny .
i feel like i' m alive again .
i feel like crying .
thank you .
i should have come here earlier if this was the case .
i thought you were angry with me .
she tricked me !
you dare to decieve me !
remember this !
you cowards !
you' re not going to get me !
takezo !
be silent !
we' ve captured your sister ...
and are holding her in your place ! and are holding her in your place !
what ?
my sister !
my sister !
come down !
if you surrender , we' il let her go free .
my sister' s done no wrong !
it' s not fair !
it' s not fair !
want to see her ?
then , come down and surrender yourself !
damn you !
who would fall for that ? !
i' il come for her for sure !
what are you waiting for ?
after him !
yes , sir !
yes , sir !
dammit !
what are you going to do ?
damn you !
takezo is here !
villagers !
why are you afraid of me ?
i' m not a beast !
i' m not a beast !
wait !
wait !
why run ?
you know who i am ?
okay .
then answer me !
okay !
i' il do anything !
please spare me !
who said i would kill you ?
do you know where my sister is ?
well ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know anything .
wait !
wait !
ok !
i' il tell you .
where is my sister ?
which jail ?
hinagura stockade !
the rumors say she' s there .
what !
hinagura stockade ?
damn them !
be gone !
he' s been murdered !
uh , otsu san ?
you look pale .
you look pale .
i saw a dead body on the roadside .
he' il be killed if he doesn' t .
it' s a vicious circle !
but , no one will attack you , so you don' t need to worry about dying in vain .
oh , a letter was delivered for you .
for me ?
to otsu , miyamoto village
from matahachi and oko
from oko ...
seems like he had someone write this .
you may have heard this news from others .
however , i am writing this to formally notify you ... that we have established a relationship with matahachi .
we have adopted him into our family .
you may have been worried .
from now on , you should forget about him .
these are the reasons i have written to you .
sincerely .
from oko to otsu san ...
he couldn' t bring himself to write to his granny ... so he wants you to relay to her that he' s living elsewhere .
that fool !
hey , otsu san ...
this is fortunate for you .
why ?
if you became his wife ... and he sent this letter , what would you do then ?
if i were you , i would be happy .
but , a woman cannot think like that .
then , how would you handle it ?
i want to find matahachi san ... and scold him !
takuan san !
otsu !
otsu , are you in ?
there you are .
oh , hello there .
otsu , the officer is demanding to see you .
he' s doesn' t want to drink alone .
he wants the usual hostess .
please !
suppress your feelings ... and please go entertain him .
okay ?
please go .
okay ?
okay ?
hey there !
priest !
oh !
there you are !
here !
come closer !
oh !
you sure are playing hard to get !
come sit here and relax .
can you pour me a drink ?
hey priest !
go away !
i don' t want you around .
no , i like it here .
i can' t relax with you reading here .
very well .
i' il close my book .
it' s not the book !
it' s you !
go away !
otsu san , this man wants to be left alone .
you love loneliness ...
such a noble trait .
okay .
we should not get in his way .
okay .
we should not get in his way .
fool !
who said that you could take otsu ? !
i just want you to leave .
how insulting !
are you angry ?
it' s been twenty days and you still can' t capture takezo .
do you think you can cut takuan' s head off ?
you' ve asked for it !
you' ve asked for it !
you will ?
how interesting .
when you do ... bring my head to your lord , ikeda terumasa of himeji castle .
he' il say , " takuan , why is only your head here ?
what ?
what ?
you' re his retainer , but you haven' t heard ?
terumasa and i are very good friends .
even studied zen together .
please !
you compelled the farmers to help you . the more selfish you become !
now you' re after otsu ...
if terumasa hears of this , you must commit seppuku .
please don' t tell !
aoki dono ...
i' il feel sorry if i leave you depressed .
i' il get takezo for you within three days .
what ?
you think i' m kidding ?
no , but ...
but what ?
including officers , footsoldiers and farmers ...
about 200 men search the mountain daily . about 200 men search the mountain daily .
how touching !
it' s spring .
the mountains are filled with food .
for takezo , it is most convenient .
well , do you want to wait for snow ?
we can' t do that !
we can' t do that !
you can' t ?
which is why i am offering to capture takezo for you .
i don' t need help .
i can manage alone .
otsu and i will suffice .
you' re joking !
however ...
i have a condition !
what' s the condition ?
what' s the condition ?
about takezo' s treatment after i capture him ...
takuan will handle it .
i can' t do that ...
i can' t do that ...
you can' t ?
very well .
if you capture him , you can decide takezo' s punishment .
however ...
if you can' t capture him within three days ...
what will you do ?
what will you do ?
i will hang myself on the 1, 000 year old cedar .
what ?
hang yourself ?
otsu san ...
watch out for the thorns .
they placed these here to trap takezo san , didn' t they ?
yes .
takuan san ...
why do the villagers despise takezo so much ?
some force must make them that way .
it' s something no one can see .
is it inside a man' s heart ?
but takezo is also at fault .
unless he kills one after another ... he can' t safeguard his life .
no one brought this misfortune to him .
his ignorance is to blame .
takuan san , do you also hate takezo san ?
of course !
i can' t ignore a man who treats life so lightly .
is that why ...
that' s why i took on this responsibility .
leaving a man like takezo on the loose ... means lives may be lost daily .
would you not agree , otsu san ?
i wish to know why he chose to return here ... despite all the danger .
that is all ?
that is all ?
also , what kind of woman matahachi is with ?
i want to hear that from takezo san .
i see ...
that may help you give him up ...
but it may work otherwise , too .
listen , otsu san ...
i thought you would be the one person who would not know the darkness of humanity .
you would grow up ... get married ... but always live a life as beautiful as a flower .
it' s getting late .
it' s getting late .
yes , it is .
it' s nearly time .
what are you looking at ?
he should be appearing soon .
you mean takezo san ?
yes .
yes .
who would come to get captured ?
no , no ...
you' re wrong .
men' s hearts are very weak .
they cannot bear to be alone .
watch what happens .
takezo may be ...
however , he can' t decide ...
poor soul , he can' t even call out .
feeling suspicous , his mean eyes may be glaring at us .
takuan san ...
what is it ?
today is the third day ...
if we cannot capture takezo san tonight ...
i know .
if it goes wrong ...
i' il just have to hang myself .
don' t worry .
i don' t intend to die yet .
then , why don' t you go looking for him ?
i wouldn' t be able to find him ... not in these hills .
hey , otsu san ... that flute you keep in your sash .
will you play that for me ?
my flute ?
any tune will do .
any tune will do .
but ...
no one is around .
don' t feel restrained .
okay , let me hear it .
takuan san , only for you ...
thank you .
you there ...
it must be cold out there in the fog .
takuan san ... why are you talking to yourself ?
can' t you tell , otsu san ?
look , takezo is there .
wait !
why do you run ?
come !
come here .
we have sake and food here .
i am neither friend nor foe .
come near the fire and warm up .
sit here .
serve takezo , too .
this is delicious .
takezo ... stop after the second bowl .
eating all at once may kill you .
otsu san ...
yes ?
why are you here ?
actually , we' re here to capture you .
i know that .
i know that .
did you ?
you came knowing that ?
very well .
takezo , if you must face the law ...
wouldn' t you rather be subjected to the law of buddha ?
huh ?
there is the law of the clan .
but buddha' s teachings are also law .
both are valid laws ... but my law is more humane in treatment .
no thanks !
no thanks !
listen !
i can understand ... why you are fighting until the end .
but can you win ?
huh ?
huh ?
win ?
win what ?
win what ?
i mean win over yourself .
worse comes to worse ...
i' il kill myself .
that granny hon' iden ...
i will kill them all !
what about your sister ?
the one who' s been imprisoned ?
fool !
takezo !
you may escape if you want ... but what will happen to your sister .
how will you face your ancestors ?
and how far do you think you can run ?
it' s takezo !
hey !
takezo' s been captured !
who did it !
who did it ?
takuan sama and otsu did it !
his luck ran out !
his luck ran out !
murderer !
you killed villagers !
we' ve captured takezo !
we' ve captured takezo !
takezo !
you killed my brother !
hey !
return my brother alive !
that' s right !
kill him !
kill him !
wait !
wait !
don' t be hasty !
takezo' s tied up and can' t get away .
now , starting today ... you can forget hunting and return to farming .
now , i have to ask you for advice .
what ?
what shall we do with takezo ?
should we kill him or let him go ?
what good would it do letting a man like him go free ?
villagers !
let me speak !
let me speak !
i can' t be satisfied with just killing him !
takuan dono , matahachi' s future ... was ruined by him !
the hon' iden family lost their precious heir .
matahachi ...
he was already good for nothing .
it might be better that you adopt a son in law .
what a thing to say !
he is the enemy of the son whom i bore !
please leave it to me how to handle takezo !
no !
no !
no !
takezo is a straggler from sekigahara .
the government should have the final say !
that' s not right ...
you made a promise .
takuan dono , the government will reward you for this .
but i will take custody of takezo .
what' s so funny ?
what' s so funny ?
mustache man ... you intend to break your promise as a samurai ?
very well .
takuan captured takezo ... and i' il release him ...
wait !
afraid ?
no sense in letting a captured man free .
i' il let you kill that man ... but hand over his head to me .
what ?
his head ?
what ?
his head ?
that' s right !
you must be kidding ?
priests tend to funerals .
if you take his body ...
i will lose my livelyhood .
besides , this granny here ... doesn' t want him dead so fast .
i know .
why don' t we hang takezo from this tree and expose him to the wind and and the rain ... and let the crows feed on his eyes ?
that' s great !
takuan dono , it' s a wonderful idea .
after that , i will finish him off with the final blow .
okay , it' s decided !
bring the ropes !
remember this !
takuan , it' s unfair !
remember !
remember !
villagers !
remember !
takuan !
unfair !
takuan , it' s unfair !
good for him !
good for him !
otsu , for capturing takezo ...
i thank you !
sir , a messenger is here .
what is it ?
what is it ?
aoki dono , it' s a message from the lord .
thank you .
hey !
guard , keep a close watch .
yes , sir !
yes , sir !
very well .
otsu , are you one of them ?
otsu ... you must be tired .
well , let me think ...
since i hear this from takezo ...
i hear matahachi is ...
living in another province .
in any case , you are matahachi' s fiancee .
the temple priest ... has blessed this union for the hon' iden family .
whatever happens ...
yes .
yes .
you' re sure ?
yes .
yes .
i' m relieved to hear that .
however , society is critical ...
if matahachi doesn' t return for a while ... it' s inconvenient for me .
why don' t you leave the temple ... and move to the hon' iden residence ?
well ...
you want me ?
who else will marry matahachi .
you are the one .
as for takezo' s case ...
i somehow cannot understand priest takuan' s true motives .
fortunately , you are here at the temple .
until takezo is dead ...
please stay here and keep an eye on him .
then ...
i don' t have to leave the temple as of yet ?
you can' t do two jobs at once .
you will come to the hon' iden house the very same day ... that takezo' s head ... is separated from his body .
understood ?
this is an order .
granny , where did you go ?
show your face !
villagers , remember this !
granny , how dare you trick me !
remember this !
remember this !
i will !
no way could i forget this !
i' il remember it for seven lives .
return matahachi !
like he was before !
shut up !
matahachi is alive !
he' s not dead !
otsu dono ?
otsu dono ?
aoki dono ?
aoki dono ?
hello , otsu dono .
i received a directive from the lord .
but , i can guess the reason .
he wants an explanation about the recent trouble .
if i have takezo' s head , i could make excuses ... but i am no match for that priest takuan !
alright , otsu !
you must be my ally now .
understand ?
i' il give you this letter .
he' s gone ...
that fool !
it' s heavy .
it' s money .
that' s a large sum .
tear up the letter and throw it away .
it' s okay .
takuan just got the buddha' s permission .
take it with you .
go on .
it' s raining .
damn you !
listen to him !
takuan !
takuan !
i want to talk to you !
come out !
come out , takuan !
takuan , come out !
it' s not like you to give up .
what is it , takezo ?
what is it , takezo ?
listen !
if i only i had known this would happen !
it' s too late now !
i surrendered myself ... because you tricked me .
i didn' t think such a thing would happen !
if i die , i want to be killed by a priest !
it was a mistake to surrender myself to you !
was that your only mistake ?
it' s more like everything was a mistake .
shut up !
i' m not ashamed of what i did !
i knew granny loved matahachi very much !
that' s why i risked my life to return and give granny that message !
just because i lost in battle , is this the treatment i get ? !
never mind those trivial things .
damn you !
look at the vastness of the world from up there .
no , you may not have enough time ?
when you go to the next world , your parents will be ... overjoyed that takuan taught you a good lesson .
takuan san , you' re being too cruel !
so cruel !
so cruel !
sympathizing with him ?
mercy !
please have mercy !
it' s started raining hard .
this looks like a big storm .
otsu , because you cried , the sky is also crying .
i better leave now .
i never thought i would end like this !
i wanted to die in a fair fight !
i don' t even know my sister' s whereabouts !
father ...
mother ...
i am so vexed !
is takezo still alive ?
oh , granny .
wasn' t that a terrible storm last night ?
wasn' t that a terrible storm last night ?
but such a good storm .
even a hard rain ... would take more than a day or two to kill a man .
look at him !
he' s hanging there like a rag !
since i see no crows pecking at his face ...
i assume that his body is still warm .
i' m alive !
no way i' m dying !
no way i' m dying !
you devil !
you' re a stubborn one !
you' re all beasts disguised as humans !
otsu san !
i' m going crazy !
i' m going crazy !
takezo san !
takezo san !
takezo san !
takezo .
takezo !
takuan !
takuan !
you corrupt priest !
from that voice , i assume you will live another five or six days .
damn priest !
hurry up and behead me !
no , i can' t behead you so easily . but you would still attack us knowing your personality .
i' il break these ropes ... and kill you soon !
just wait !
how promising !
i will wait for you then .
but maybe your life might end before that .
damn you !
you can move the tree !
but you can' t affect the ground below ...
or the heaven above .
being ignorant , you can' t even shake loose a cedar leaf .
damn you !
takezo .
why didn' t you use your strength and youth more constructively ?
you were born a human ... yet you live like the lions and the wolves .
you' ve never seen the light of your intellect .
now , that light may die here .
shut up !
listen to me , takezo .
i' il bet ... you thought no one was stronger than you .
but look at you now !
how miserable !
i never lose when it comes to strength !
whether you lose in strength or wits , you still lost .
as proof , i am the victor sitting on this rock ... and you are suffering miserably ... hanging above my head !
what is the difference ?
you' re lecturing me ? !
how shameless !
however strong , a beast is still a beast ...
less than human .
how pitiful .
you know not the light of wisdom .
a man' s true strength is not what you possess .
takezo !
give it good thought one more night .
i' il cut your head off anytime you want .
wait !
wait !
what ?
what ?
let me down !
what did you say ?
i want to live again .
i want to start all over .
i don' t want to die yet .
i beg you !
no !
in life , you can' t start all over .
now you shed tears of repentance like a human .
so as to not make your dead face unsightly ...
pray to amida buddha and enjoy your last moments of life .
save me !
takezo san !
otsu san ?
otsu san ?
i' il come up to save you .
please wait .
run away , takezo san .
you' re saving me ?
you' re saving me ?
yes , i will .
please wait .
otsu san , it' s dangerous .
otsu san , cut the rope !
just go ahead !
cut it !
cut it !
cut it !
hurry !
hurry !
i' m still alive !
i' m still alive !
otsu san !
are you all right ?
are you all right ?
please cut the ropes !
hold on to me !
otsu san .
otsu san .
the hinagura stockade is in this mountain range .
i hear my sister is being held there .
ogin sama ?
ogin sama ?
yes !
unless i go , her life will be endangered .
otsu san , wait here !
okay ?
here ?
where are we ?
the top of mount nagayama .
over there is mount harima ... and on the left is mount himeji .
with each day that passes , it becomes more dangerour for her .
let me go .
please .
let me go to save my sister !
please !
takezo san , please go and save ogin .
you will let me go ?
thank you !
don' t worry about the rest .
i will go ahead to himeji castle town and wait for you .
yes , wait for me .
that' s right !
please wait by hanada bridge where you can see the castle .
yes , i will wait for a hundred or even a thousand days .
a hundred or a thousand days ...
otsu san !
i will be sure to return to you .
by all means !
sister !
sister !
slster !
slster !
slster !
slster !
slster !
slster !
slster !
it' s as you see .
priest takuan and otsu are gone .
what ?
takuan , too ?
then it must be their doing !
it must be them !
pursuit is not necessary !
i' il find them and punish the bad " bride to be " for this .
hanada bridge
what is wrong ?
are you okay ?
you don' t feel well ?
my goodness !
what a fever !
okay , come to my home .
you needn' t hesitate .
grandma !
grandma !
hurry !
bring some water !
hurry !
hurry !
gon , before leaving home , i put on my ancestoral sash ... and before i left our gate , i vowed to our ancestors ... that i will punish my unfaithful daughter in law ... and determine if matahachi if dead or alive .
if he' s alive , i will bring him home by the neck ... and get a better bride than otsu .
that will regain our family honor in the village .
here , have some cold water .
to hanada brldge
wait !
takuan !
takezo .
you scum priest !
how dare you trick me , you coward !
don' t be so upset .
that was the only way i could save you from aoki tanzaemon .
making excuses !
i see ... but you' il see soon .
using the same tactics again to trick me !
don' t get mad .
takezo ... about your sister ogin ...
what ?
is my sister safe ?
that' s right .
takezo , follow me ...
where ?
to my sister ?
never mind where .
you' il let me see her ?
yes , there is someone i would like you to meet .
what a dauntless expression !
the shinmen family were once vassals of the akamatsu clan .
the akamatsu clan were once the lords of this castle .
it must be fate that you were brought here .
takuan ...
aoki tanzaemon insists this man is trouble .
no .
if you investigate , you' il find the truth .
yes , i already have and i' ve learned of tanzaemon' s viciousness .
then , will you allow me to handle him ?
granted .
how will you handle him ?
i heard that ghosts dwell within the attic of this castle .
i' m thinking of borrowing that room ... to confine takezo .
very well .
takezo ... these black lacquer like stains ... are all human blood .
your ancestors that lost this castle ...
the sad final blood of the akamatsu clan .
what ?
you mean the same blood that flows through my body ?
that' s right .
the very same , takezo .
though it may be good blood ... unless it is polished , it rots and becomes the blood of a beast .
in the old days , great priests ... would isolate themselves and submerse themselves in literature . and gradually open up their mind' s eye .
think of this room as your mother' s womb ... and nurture your link to the past .
alright , takezo ?
over there , you will find the writings of japanese and chinese scholars .
these scholars have greatly contributed to our culture .
it' s up to you to make this a place of darkness ... or an enlightened place of learning .
alright ...
takezo !
takezo !
what will be the future of the akamatsu clan that led the great uprising ?
look at the blood on the beam and look at the blood on the floor !
we have only faced defeat !
takezo !
that blood is still flowing within your body !
it' s the akamatsu blood .
what do you want me to do ?
the battle' s over !
without a war to fight ... how do i live on ?
takezo !
you know the answer !
make the most out of our remorses .
the dream of victory at sekigahara is over !
you' re telling me to dream again ? !
there are no more battles !
anywhere !
this is a nightmare !
we , the spirits condemed to hell , can never rest in peace .
the blood of akamatsu !
takezo !
takezo !
please purify it with the light of wisdom ...
the light of wisdom !
a tea scoo`p cannot be too thick or too thin .
it must endure heat and moisture , but remain graceful .
that' s right .
bend it slowly .
give the handle a slight curve ... and create a deep roundness at the tip .
be slow .
be patient .
and don' t force it .
too much at once makes a ladle brittle .
yes , that' s right .
that' s the way .
if only people' s hearts were like this ladle ...
otsu san , if this takezo san is still alive ... he will come for you for sure .
yes .
a hundred or a thousand days ...
otsu san !
i will be sure to return to you .
takuan san !
how is your condition ?
much better .
welcome .
otsu san is a great help to the business .
thank you for looking after her .
this is well made .
this is well made .
i can' t do it very well yet .
oh !
you can clearly see the top of the castle today .
the birds are circling around ... and around ... and flying slowly ...
see anything else ?
no , nothing .
you will see in time .
if you wait , you' il find out .
if you wait , you' il find out .
what will i find ?
before today , my courage ...
the strength of a warrior is nothing like that .
one must be aware of the fearful ... and yearn to live ...
he must care about his life .
