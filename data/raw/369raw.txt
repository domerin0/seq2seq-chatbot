my technician is set up in your office .
these forms are standard except what ?
it has a nondisclosure clause .
during the flight ... ... you may overhear mr. drucker' s phone calls .
anything from big mergers ... ... to inside information on his sports teams .
we have a legal obligation to protect that stuff .
this guy think he' s the president ?
he considers her to be the world' s second most important person .
that' s big stuff .
all for a day of snowboarding ?
the blood test was agony .
seriously , i was screaming .
she' s kidding .

it doesn' t hurt .
press your thumb here .

just like that .
all done .
didn' t feel a thing .

pilots , drivers , security , assistants .
basically , anyone who comes in contact with mr. drucker .
i press here ?
and here .
perfect , both of you .
after this , i' m going to town to test a chef and two waiters .
the pink copy of the charter contract is yours .
i' il take the rest .

i know , but once you see it , you' il say yes .
deep down inside , you' re a softy .
they specifically asked for adam by name .
i know .
i also know that the bodyguards can' t tell the difference .
they never got our names .
that' s true .
adam , i know i screw around a lot , but when it comes to flying ... ... you know i' m serious .
i could do it .

i want the speaker of the house .

i' m michael drucker .
you must be adam gibson .

pete hume says you know the mountains like nobody else .

welcome to woodland mall , over 1200 retail outlets to serve you ,
food court , ground level , megaplex theater , 15th level ,
stop the cloning .
say no to repet .
stop the cloning .
god doesn' t want you to go in there .
then god shouldn' t have killed my dog .
atheist .
we can clone your four legged loved one in a few hours ,
how can we do it ?
it begins with growing " blanks " ,,, ,,, animal drones stripped of characteristic dna ,,, ,,, in embryonic tanks at the repet factory ,
ln stage two , yourpet' s dna ,,, ,,, is extracted from a lock of fur ora drop ofblood ,,, ,,, then infused on a cellularlevel into the blank ,
ln the final stage , using repet' s cerebral syncording process ,,, ,,, all yourpets thoughts , memories and instincts ,,, ,,, are transplanted via the optic nerve ,
still can' t make up your mind , huh ?
you lost a dog , right ?
yes , my daughter' s .
what a heartbreak .
what did you say was his name again ?
oliver .
oliver' s in luck ... ... because we' re having a special this week , 20 percent off .
when did oliver die ?
this morning .
perfect .
we can do a post mortem syncording ... ... but act fast because there' s a 1 2 hour window on deceased brains .
i have a problem with the whole idea .
suppose the clones have no soul or they' re dangerous ?
clone pets are every bit as safe as real pets .
plus ... ... they' re insured .
lf it' s so safe ... ... then why is it against the law to clone humans ?
because the human brain is too complicated to syncord .
you remember the experiment they did ?
that' s why it didn' t work .
now it' s illegal to even try .
but with pets , it' s a totally proven technology .
your repet oliver will be exactly the same dog .
he' il know the tricks you taught him ... ... where the bones are buried he won' t even know he' s a clone .
and did i mention ... ... they' re insured .
i don' t care about insurance .
i care if i can trust my daughter with an animal with sharp teeth .
we can make him smaller .
with softer teeth .
you can ?
we can even color coordinate him to match your decorating scheme .
sim pals , the best friend money can buy ,
let me think about that . who' s fun to be with , treatyourkids
look , i might be back .
you' il be back .
your daughter will think you' re the best .
my sister has two and loves them .
good .
come , let' s fix the collar .
there you are .
it' s amazing how real this is .
i know .
my daughter will be so excited .
come , let' s go home .
you have called hank morgan ,
hi , i' m not here , so leave a message ,
hank , it' s me again .
what happened to you ?
i waited at kelly' s for half an hour .

son of a bitch .
hold my belt .
okay .

little more .
get some people to look for this guy !
pick up wiley and talia' s bodies and get them to the lab .
i' m dr , griffin weir , welcome to the new weir organ transplant facility ,
thanks for visiting replacement technologies ,
doctor , protesters claim that cloning human organs ,,, ,,, will lead to cloning whole humans ,
that' s not only illegal , we' re years from the technology to do it .
a human was cloned over 1 0 years ago .
and we know the outcome of that bizarre experiment .
lf you recall , the supreme court ordered the clone be destroyed ... ... and i think that was the humane thing to do .
it led to laws against human cloning ... ... and set back the course of legitimate research by years .
mr. drucker !
you gave
this is dr. weir' s night , okay ?
ls it true you want to get the 6th day laws repealed ?
dr. weir is interested in medicine , not politics .
mr. drucker , the protesters claim you run repet at a loss ... ... to soften people up to human cloning .
you know , we shouldn' t forget that not long ago ... ... there were almost no more fish left in the ocean ... ... and half the world' s population faced the threat of hunger .
cloning technology turned that around .
extremists won' t admit they' d rather people went hungry ... ... than eat cloned fish , so they yell about human cloning .
do you think human cloning laws should be changed ?
suppose a 1 0 year old boy is in the hospital , dying of liver cancer .
thanks to dr. weir' s work ... ... we can save that boy .
ln the next bed lies another 1 0 year old boy ... ... whose parents love him just as much ... ... only he has an inoperable brain tumor .
you cannot clone a brain .
the only way to save him would be to clone the whole person .
how do you tell that boy' s parents that we can save the first boy ... ... but the research that would have saved their son wasn' t done ... ... because of a law passed by frightened politicians a decade ago ?
so , what does that mean ?
enjoy the party .
looks like you needed rescuing .
yes , i did .
thank you .
weir clinic , stay away !
no research on dna !
weir clinic , stay away !
no research on dna !
hey , boss !
johnny .
how' s my star quarterback ?
i' d say i felt like a million bucks , but i' d hate to take a pay cut .
don' t remind me , all right ?
that was one nasty hit you took last week .
be careful .
we don' t want you getting killed .
katherine ?
are you all right ?
i' m just feeling like i don' t quite belong .
but i' m fine .
really .
no , you' re not .
should i call dr. stevens ?
no , no , no .
i just overdid it , that' s all .
i' il get a car to take you home .
thank you .
mr. speaker ?
thank you so much for coming .
champagne ?
that was quite a speech .
you heard that ?
sorry i got carried away .
your words meant a great deal to me .
as it happens , i have a son with an inoperable tumor of the brain .
oh , my god .
i' m so sorry , sir .
it must have been in my subconscious , knowing you were here .
no , no , it' s all right .
gave me a lot to think about .
it gave me a different view of the subject .
mr. speaker ... ... could i offer you a glass of brandy in my office upstairs ?
i was 0 when billy was born .
i didn' t know if i wanted another kid so late .
but now i love him so damn much .
lf there were something we could do for billy ... ,,, only it was highly illegal ,,, ... would you consider it ?
of course i would .
that' s the same hypothetical
no , no .
don' t answer so fast .
you' d face a minimum sentence of 40 years if it ever came out .
but he' d be cured ?
he' d be exactly the same .
perfect health ,
never even have to know .
but if the secret came out ,,, ... with the law now ... ,,, he' d be put to sleep like a rabid dog ,
he' d be destroyed , like a horse with a broken leg .
and ifit never came out ?
or if the laws were changed one day ?
billy wouldn' t have anything to worry about .
i beg you .
i beg you .
go to my house and pick up my wife and daughter .
lf i go there , they' il kill them both .
you made a different report an hour ago .
no , i didn' t .
according to this , you did .
that must have been the clone .
look , i know it sounds crazy .
i can hardly believe it myself .
was your car stolen or not ?
yes .
so you did report it ?
no , i took it .
you stole your own car ?
i' m a court appointed virtual attorney .
you don' t have to answer .
ls my client being charged with auto theft ?
i didn' t steal it !
it' s mine !
he claims it was filed by his clone .
i see .
loading virtual psychiatrist .
mr. gibson , what seems to be the trouble ?

son of a bitch !
piece of shit wiley .
i' m gonna kill him .
where is he ?
he' s still cooking .
son of a bitch .
i look like crap .
do you have any idea how much my hair treatments cost ?
how much does gibson know ?
that he' s been cloned and we' il kill anyone who sees them together .
what' s that ?
what ?
does drucker know you' re talking about killing innocent people ?
relax .
it' s just a threat .
of course , we' d never actually do it .
try to have a good night .
you do your hair .
i' il take wiley and vincent .
i' ve got to pierce my damn ears again .
officials blame the latest strike by majorleague players ,,, ,,, entering its 4th year and a lack ,,, ,,, of fan identification with teams in the series for the dismal ratings ,
shit .
oh , no .
now what ?
it feels tight all across here ... ... where the tires ran over me .
you were run over by two cars and your chest was crushed .
exactly .
i mean , no wonder , right ?
it' s in your mind .
completely crushed .
as in dead .
as in you have a totally new chest now .
then why is it hard to breathe ?
tell you what .
why don' t you just stay out here ?
relax .
the fresh air will do you good .
state and government officials in washington , d, c ,,, ,,, are openly dismissive of the microsoftproposal ,
this amounts to an attempt by microsoft to buy a state of the union ,
nothing in our constitution orhistory ,,, ,,, offers the remotest legal theory ,,, ,,, by which a corporation can , in effect , own a state ,
but if he goes off his medication , the paranoid delusions come back .
very sad .
because at other times , he seems almost rational .
gibson !
gibson !
you' re dead .
no .
you' re dead .
try to stay dead this time .
hank , it' s me again ,

it took me 1 7 generations to get this right .

i felt fingers going for my zipper .
that' s disgusting .
that' s disgusting ?
i had to look away when you and natalie were

hank morgan was an abomination to god .
he was a clone .
he was no clone .
the real hank morgan died this afternoon .
i killed him .
so i could ... ... so i could kill drucker .
drucker isn' t dead .
it would be all over the news .
open your eyes .
drucker' s a clone .
dr. weir cloned drucker .
dr. weir cloned your friend .
dr. weir cloned you .

what about her dna scan ?
came up with cystic fibrosis .
cystic fibrosis ?
which is impossible , considering it' s a childhood disease ... ... and she would have been dead 30 years ago .
we' re running the scan again .
no , i' il do it at the clinic .
lf you could give us a moment , please .

weir clinic , stay away !
no research on dna !
weir clinic , stay away !
no research on dna !
thanks for visiting replacement technologies ,
we' re in the business oflife ,
welcome to the new home of the weir organ transplant facility ,,, ,,, here at replacement technologies ,
excuse me , sir .
i' ve got to check that .
sure .
help yourself .
but ... ... you might want to use these .
what' s in here ?
lower intestines for dr. weir .
he' s doing a study on the flesh eating virus .
you can open it .
just try not to breathe .
that' s okay .
you' re cleared .
thanks .
what about herdna scan ?
came up with cystic fibrosis ,
which is impossible considering it' s a childhood disease
dead 30 years ago ,
so we' re running a new scan ,
no , i' il do it at the clinic ,
we' ve had 5 extra years since you cloned me ,
i treasure that ,
katherine , please , no ,
please ,
i' m not afraid .
i want to die .
my time has already passed .
can i help you ?
no .
i just dropped my pen .
i' m all thumbs today .
thank you .
will you cut that out ?
it' s driving me crazy .
excuse me , but i nearly had my head ripped off and it hurts .
it' s only psychological .
your neck doesn' t really hurt .
you' d know better about that ?
yes , he would .
it was your old neck that got broken .
this is your new neck .
get it ?
i got killed twice in two hours .
knock it off .
we' ve all been killed .
you know what really bothers me ?
that i' ve never even seen a white light .
never seen angels .
nothing .
give me a break .
i have you logged in .
what ?
when ?
twenty minutes ago .
you' ve entered a restricted area .
son of a bitch has got my thumb .
deactivate talia , put out a security alert ... ... and seal off drucker' s office , now !
let' s go !
shit .
can i help you ?
yeah .
you can stick your thumb on that .
thank god .
what ?
more fundamentalists ?
no .
adam gibson .
we think he' s in the building .
why wasn' t he taken care of already ?
there are four of you and one of him !
two of him , but you see what i mean .
he has a wife and kid , right ?
get them .
we may need the leverage .
it costs me $1 . 2 million each time i clone you people .
try to be worth the money .
they' il kill you for seeing this .
they' re doing their best already .
where' s dr. weir ?
his lab' s over there .
dr. weir .
dr. weir .
i know about the intruder .
your office called .
everything' s under control .
it' s not under control .
you had me cloned .
yes .
well , you cloned the wrong man .
how did you do it ?
you had to have my what do you call it ?
your syncording .
we had it .
give it to me .
i want my life back .
here .
it' s your syncording .
how did you get this ?
i haven' t been  here .
the vision test .
it didn' t test vision .
it took your syncording .
an exact picture of your mind .
and it took sample of dna .
with those we can clone a person in 2 hours .
we had you so we could act quickly when we were told you were killed .
told i was killed ?
please don' t drink and drive ,
gibson family schedule ,
clara' s recital at school ,
this is michael drucker' s .
a syncording contains everything in a person' s memory ... ... and this is what drucker saw and heard just before he died .
you don' t become a rich man without making enemies ... ... so we back up his mind religiously .
you own the roadrunners , right ?
among other things ,
you a fan ?
i' m a fan ofboth those teams ,
i' il have to getyou some tickets ,
promise , right ?
sure , i' il do it right now ,
sally , remind me to get roadrunner tickets foradam gibson ,
he' s mypilot today ,
on the sixth day , god created man ,
i' m about to get on my snowboard hey , he' s got a gun !
shit , it' s a fundamentalist ,
hejust shot them both , call marshall , you hearme ?
sally ?
oh , shit ,
no , you don' t have to sally !
help !
an anti cloning fundamentalist killed everyone on board .
it should have been me .
we thought it was you .
drucker even mentioned your name .
so , we used your dna and syncording to clone you .
to resurrect him , we had to cover it up .
keep talking .
we cloned everyone .
we realized you switched places too late .
access denied , lnvalid thumbprint ,
they' re trying to kill me .
there are two adam gibsons .
that' s proof humans are being cloned ... ... which makes you very dangerous to drucker .
accessing security , tell me why i' m a threat .
drucker was killed 3 years ago .
we cloned him then ...
... and we cloned him yesterday .
so ?
lf that came out , he' d be destroyed in every way .
a clone has no rights , a clone can' t own anything ,
drucker would lose all this ... ... because drucker would be ... ... legally dead .
look at all the cameras you got in this place .
you can' t find one guy ?
there .
there .
we don' t need where he' s been .
we need to find where he is .
let' s go .
hit the alarm .
what' s up ?
what area' s so sensitive ... ... we don' t allow cameras ?
drucker will do anything
anything to destroy the evidence .
and you' re the evidence .
this is evidence too .
move !
clear the way !
let' s go .
i have to go to the bathroom .
okay , clara .
anyone else need to go ?
why do you think i' m telling you ?
because i can do nothing to stop them .
there he is !
zone six .
engineering .
move !
clear the way !
or what they' il do to your family .
my family ?
drucker has to kill one of you . lf he can' t kill you , he' il kill the other .
they could get killed in the process .
get out !
destination " get out " not understood ,
morgan randall elementary school !
i' m very sorry , sir .
daddy !
she' s supposed to be up there now , right ?
this is the ....
that' s odd .
i' m gonna go check and make sure everything' s okay .
excuse me .
of course .
clara ?
oh , my god .
mommy !
mommy , i' m scared .
i' m here .
i got you .
could you help us ?
what are you doing ?
this is the only thing keeping the dogs ... ... from tearing her apart .
so be quiet and come with us .
let' s go !
daddy !
adam !
natalie !
you have reached 911 emergency ,
your call is important to us , i know .
your " yes " or " no " answers ,,, ,,, will help us in directing police services to assistyou ,
are you reporting a felony ?
yes .
thank you forreporting a felony , come on .
ls the felony in progress now ?
yes !
thank you ,
ls there a danger ofbodily harm to you or others ?
yes !
are suspects orinjured victims ,,,,
forget about talking to the police .
i tried that already .
who the hell are you ?
i know this sounds insane , but ... ... l' m adam gibson .
we don' t have time for you to be shocked .
they have natalie and clara .
i need your help to get my family .
they' re my family .
that' s for sleeping with my wife ... ... in the damn minivan .
yourreport has been canceled atyourrequest ,
thanks for visiting replacement technologies ,
it' s him .
i believe you have something of mine .
no , i have everything ofyours ,
i have the syncording thatproves you' re a clone ,
your family in the palm of my hand .
shall we trade ?
you read my mind ,
just the highlights .
all right , i' il bring the disk ,,, ,,, to the double x charter office at 10; 00 tonight ,
be there with my family ,
did you have to hit me that hard ?
i had to stop you from talking to the police .
that' s a good one .
that should do it .
what are you doing ?
testing it .
i don' t think you have enough aluminum .
are you kidding ?
that' s the same amount i used in the rain forest war .
you shouldn' t be talking .
the mess you left trying to fix your garage ....
you saw me working in the garage ?
saw you ?
i nearly shot you .
let' s try it .
cool .
cool .
you better be miles away when this goes off .
i' m worried about getting inside to find natalie and clara .
i' il take my chances getting out .
griffin .
here .
what are you doing ?
yours .
yours .
griffin , what' s the matter ?
my wife , katherine , is dead .
oh , jesus christ .
griffin , i don' t know
i' m so sorry .
don' t start with " sorry " with me .
don' t start !
don' t start with " sorry " !
i know about the congenital defects you' ve been imbedding ... ... into the clone dna .
there' s my wife , johnny phoenix and the others .
but , michael , why my wife ?
why ?
you' re right , griffin .
it' s a security protocol i implemented .
i knew you wouldn' t understand .
what should i understand ?
the only thing i understand is that ... ... you gave my wife cystic fibrosis !
calm down .
someone made a mistake .
this wasn' t meant to hurt her .
it didn' t hurt her .
it killed her .
suppose we clone a senator who agrees to support us , then doesn' t .
or johnny phoenix wants more money .
shorter life spans gives us leverage .
what' s the point ?
the point is , if they betray us they' re dead .
lf they stay on the team , we clone them again .
exactly what we' il do with katherine .
i' m sure she' s being cloned now .
no , she' s not .
no .
she' s
griffin , it was a mistake .
lf you' re concerned about her dna , go through it yourself .
obviously there' s no charge for the cloning .
no charge .
thank you very much .
what you don' t understand is , she doesn' t want to be cloned .
so , do it anyway .
do it anyway .
i see .
let me explain something to you .
i loved my wife very much .
so much so , i promised i' d never bring her back again .
and i won' t .
and if i can' t bring her back , i' il never bring back anyone , ever .
that' s how much i loved her .
so , it' s over , it' s finished ... ... and i quit .
well , i can' t let you quit .
i' ve looked the other way too often .
i' ve justified too much , so ...
... l' m finished .
it' s over .
know what i' m going to do for you ?
what are you going to do for me ?
i' m going to give you ... ... the greatest gift you can imagine .
a gift ?
i' m gonna save your life .
i' m gonna save katherine' s life .
i' m gonna save our friendship .
and i' m gonna save your marriage .
what are you talking about ?
i' m gonna kill you now ... ... and i' m going to clone you using your latest syncording .
then i' il clone katherine using her last syncording .
you understand ?
do you see what i' m doing for you ?
you' il be together , neither of you will remember you promised not to clone her .
or that she even died .
obviously you won' t remember this conversation .
you' re welcome .
all right , now show me my family ,
bastards .
i knew it .
yoursyncording isn' t here ,
it was being flown by remote .
both of you , get back here now .
come on .
this is a private pad .
you can' t land that here .
i' m here to pick up mr. drucker .
it' s my charter contract .
everything' s normal , mr. drucker , but we' il stay alert .
what time are you taking off ?
take off ?
i didn' t order
yourpilot' s on his way to reception ,
now you listen to me .
seal the building , full security alert ,
find this pilot , he is armed and dangerous ,
and get wiley and some men up to my office now ,
freeze the elevators .
shut down level 2 and 3 parking garages .
zone 6 , engineering corridor .
there .
sector 3 .
he' s headed right towards you , dan .
turn around !
don' t try it .
get people up the stairwell !
teams 3 and 4 , close off on him !
let' s go !
he shot out a power box .
he' s trashing the whole system .
we got him trapped .
west stairwell between 1 3 and 14 .
let' s go !
cover the stairwell doors !
fire in front of him !
okay !
you did pretty good !
fooled us at the airport !
managed to turn this place into shambles !
you' re the greatest , dad !
mr. drucker would like to talk to you .
and , of course , we do have your family !
all right .
go get him .
well , well .
adam gibson .
i wish i could say , " the one and only .
looks like we both went back on our word .
you' il find we have more in common  where' s my family ?
right to business .
an admirable trait .
there they are .
all safe and sound .
for the moment .
your syncording is not on him ... ... it' s not in his whisper craft .
i knew you' d double cross me , so i gave it to my clone .
anything happens to me or my family ... ... the next time you see it will be at your murder trial .
dr. weir didn' t tell you .
tell me what ?
adam , adam , adam .
he' s not the clone .
you are .
ask yourself something .
you remember anything after being scanned by my bodyguard ?
i need to check your vision , place your chin here ,
changing places with your friend ?
buddy , wake up , we' re here , woodland mall ,
the salesman at repet thought it was ... ... odd you came in twice .
asked the same questions ... ... twice .
still can' t make up yourmind , huh ?
you lost a dog , right ?
let me see your chin ,
you cutyourselfshaving ,
your shaving cut ?
easily reproduced .
so is the scar from your old war wound .
i know who i am .
i know you do .
talia ?
how many times have you been cloned ?
i' ve lost count .
there' s one way to tell .
show him .
it' s the only way to track what generation a clone is .
see ?
four dots means ... ... she' s been cloned four times .
come on .
let' s take a look at yours .
take a look in the mirror .
let' s find out if you are who you think you are .
just under your left eye .
kind of takes the fun out of being alive , doesn' t it ?
so , you see ... ... your family isn' t really your family .
they' re his .
and you , my friend , are in exactly the same boat as all of us .
lf adam gibson gets that syncording to the authorities ... ... we' il all be destroyed .
lf you really love your wife and kid ... ... you' il tell me where adam gibson is .
we' il get my syncording back , we' il get rid of him .
you' il tell me where adam gibson is .
we' il get my syncording back , we' il get rid of him .
they' il never know you' re the clone .
that , or lose them forever .
adam , i' m not making this offer because i have to .
i can get everything from your memories .
the fact is , i' d like you to understand ... ... you' d be serving a higher purpose .
ln two years , three tops , i' il control enough votes to get the laws changed .
then we won' t have to lose our best people .
our mozarts ... ... our martin luther kings .
we will finally be able to conquer death .
we will finally be able to conquer death .
and who gets to decide ... ... who lives and who dies ?
you ?
you have a better idea ?
yeah .
what about god ?
you' re one of those .
i suppose you think science is inherently evil .
no , i don' t think science is inherently evil .
but i think you are .
lf you believe god created man in his own image ... ... you believe he gave man power to understand evolution ... ... to exploit science , to manipulate the genetic code .
to do exactly what i' m doing .
i' m just taking over where god left off .
lf you really believe that , then you should clone yourself ... ... while you' re still alive .
why' s that ?
so i can understand your unique perspective ?
no .
so you can go fuck yourself .
now you' il tell us where you put mr. drucker' s syncording !
you won' t find it in my head .
i told him to hide it so i wouldn' t know where it is .
we' il see about that .
yeah , we will .
let' s go .
get in here .
come on !
come on !
come on !
fine !
have it your way !
that didn' t hurt so bad .
asshole .
let' s go back a few minutes .
here' s drucker' s syncording ,
there' s the other one .
keep this ,
lfl' m not back in an hour , you know what to do ,
don' t worry , lfanything happens to you ormy family ,,, ... l' m gonna destroy that son of a bitch .
you got the location ?
the airport .
i was just there .
he' il be dead in 20 minutes .
let' s go .
betrayed by your own mind .
wait !
wait !
what ?
they staged that scene for us .
the other one sat behind him so we couldn' t see him .
the bastard faked his own syncording .
one hid and this one avoided looking at him so he wouldn' t be in his memory .
you mean the other one' s here too ?
yes , that' s correct .
now put out another alert .
this one is the diversion !
he smashes the cameras , gets captured ... ... meanwhile , the other one strolls in and takes his wife and kid .
ldiot !
natalie , clara .
oh , my god .
what' s going on ?
daddy ?
don' t worry , sir .
get him up .
i' m scared , dad .
what' s going on ?
this isn' t because of the cigar ?
no .
i' il explain to you later .
don' t worry .
he' s not going anywhere .
we' il get him .
wait .
talia , you go .
you two stay here .
have them block all the exits .
henderson ... ... seal off the tank area , levels 6 and 7 .
i' m trying .
give me a minute .
and get us some power up here .
don' t move .
my daughter is right inside that door .
i don' t want to expose her to any graphic violence .
she already gets enough of that from the media .
put your weapons down .
nice and easy .
good .
now , when you go inside ... ... you say ....
have a nice flight , little girl .
they' re friends of daddy' s .
all right , let' s go .
we' il have a little midnight flight with daddy and mommy .
there we are .
all right ?
there you go , sir .
wiley .
go .
wiley , just wait one second .
not again .
and don' t bring him back .
stupid bastard blew a hole through my stomach .
god .
i' il be dead in 20 minutes , tops .
but what better place , right ?
henderson ?
where' s my power ?
coming on line now , sir .
get all exits blocked , all exits !
shit .
go start warming up a blank .
do a fresh syncording .
i want my mind up to the minute .
here it is .
this is a fresh one .
this will be a complete syncording .
ls that talia ?
go help her .
we' il find them .
what have you got ?
tanks 3 and 4 , nothing .
okay , go .
take the back walk .
no .
oh , god .
oh , no .
take her to your mother' s ... ... and stay there until i come .
come with us , daddy .
i have to help a friend , okay ?
bye .
i love you .
wiley , you shot me !
oh , right .
that was you .
i' ve got to get dressed .
you' re not even going to wait ... ... until i die ?
would you ?
come on .
get it off .
you got blood on the jacket .
jesus christ .
what ?
what ?
what ?
look ... ... we can make a deal .
i didn' t do anything to you .
it was all him .
listen to me .
i can rebuild all this in a very short time .
i can still save you , adam .
save me ?
we put defects in the clone dna to give them short life spans .
want to know what you' il die of ?
how long you' ve got to live ?
we can go right upstairs and look it up .
we all have to die someday .
we don' t have to die .
i' m offering you the chance to live forever .
never aging .
perfect in every way .
perfect ?
like you ?
look .
here is your " perfection .
oh , god .
there' s no need to panic .
i can fix this .
you won' t fix anything .
it' s over .
it' s finished .
it' s finished .
when i said you should screw yourself ... ... l didn' t mean for you to take it literally .
go after him .
get him .
check the roof !
you !
up top !
come on !
can you fly this ?
better than you can .
good .
because your shooting sucks .
let' s get out of here .
shit .
come on !
try to climb over me !
come on !
hurry up !
come on !
shit !
you know , i keep wondering ... ... am i really human ?
do i have a soul ?
well , your dna scan came back normal , didn' t it ?
yeah .
zero defects .
just like a repet commercial .
lf you' re not human , they would have mentioned it .
all right , enough philosophy .
i better get going .
i' ve got 3 weeks at sea to figure it out .
hurry if you want to see clara .
thanks for letting me say goodbye to your family .
now , wait .
this is your family too .
you were willing to die to save them .
think about that while you' re at sea ... ... wondering if you' re really human or not .
because if that' s not being human ... ... l don' t know what is .
thanks .
hello , everybody .
look what i brought .
a kitty !
oh , sadie .
i thought that ... ... hank' s cat was a
she is .
but you hate repets .
well , i changed my mind .
you old softie .
can we keep her ?
please ?
of course .
that' s why i brought her home .
put her down .
good .
thank you so much .
