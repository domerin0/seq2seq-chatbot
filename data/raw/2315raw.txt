please help me !
i can' t move !
help me !
i can' t move !
oh my god !
sarah , save what you' re doing and log out .
i need you on something now .
what is it ?
i just heard from one of our sources .
there' s a high probability that someone from our fbi watchlist was spotted in l. a. yesterday .
thomas sharek .
who is he ?
he' s done work with several terrorist cells outside istanbul . coordinating several suicide bombings last summer .
istanbul ...
there was some chatter this morning about a possible attack by a group out of turkey .
here it is .
from ankarah .
what was the target ?
east coast .
new york or d. c.
but the time window passed .
passed ?
the targetted time was for 8 a. m. it' s already past 10 on the east coast .
what if they got the target wrong and it' s west coast time ?
then it' s gonna go down within the hour .
tell curtis , i' il take this to driscoll .
i can take it to her .
why ?
i thought you wanted to keep working it up .
you know , you' re really transparent , sarah .
stop trying to be driscoll ' pet , she doesn' t like it .
have you had voice confirmation from anyone on the train ?
no , the signal has just confirmed a bomb .
we' re trying to get in contact now .
it' s in a remote area but local police are heading to the scene .
alright .
we have discretionary authority out of point magoo .
have them direct one of their patrol aircraft over the area .
put the pilot in contact with our people .
should we monitor emergency services ?
no , county will cover that .
a truck loaded with c4 just derailed a train in santa clarita .
free up some of your people .
division' s gonne send over data .
that could be realted to what we just found downstairs .
what did you found ?
two things .
first , there was intelligence indicating the possibility of an attack at 8 o' clock this morning .
bombing was at 7 .
that' s within an hour of the time .
what' s the second thing ?
a turkish national ont the fbi watchlist by the name of thomas sharek was last seen in the city . he could be related to the bombing .
okay .
open up channels with divison .
start investigating this bombing .
and work up what you have on sharek .
we' il brief in a few minutes .
what about the defence department meeting ?
it' s in a half hour .
who' s secretary heller sending ?
jack bauer .
jack ...
you sure ?
yeah , he hasn' t been back ... well , since you fired him .
is it gonna be uncomfortable ?
what ?
going back to ctu .
seeing driscoll again .
i don' t blampe her for her decision .
how can that be ?
she forced you out of ctu .
she didn' t want a junky on her staff .
that' s not unreasonable .
you weren' t a junky .
you were doing youre job .
i was addicted to heroin .
it didn' t matter why .
do you miss your old job ?
i could have joined other agencies if i still wanted to do field work .
but i didn' t .
i wanted something different for my life .
it might not seem like a lot to you .
but for me , to be able to have this kind of connections .
i couldn' t do that before .
i' m glad you can now .
we' d better go .
yeah .
secretary heller is gonna be in the lobby in 5 minutes .
secretary heller ?
yeah , i called him dad once in a press conference so i decided then to use his title all the time .
audrey .
your father is a very perceptive man .
i would like to tell him about us before he finds out on his own .
look ...
my dad is kind of old fashioned .
even though paul and i are separated , he ... he still considers us married .
i understand that .
and i don' t want your father to draw the wrong conclusion and think that i had anything to do with the break up between you and paul .
yeah , but you didn' t .
please jack .
let' s just give it a little more time .
i' m gonna tell you something and i don' t want you to pannick .
i' m falling in love with you .
look , i dont want you to say anything .
and i don' t need you to feel the same way .
i just wanted you to know .
i will see you downstairs .
alright .
here is what we have : a known terrorist named thomas sharek managed through the country undetected .
we believe there' s a likelyhood sharek helped organized the train attack in santa clarita .
if he did , he' s gonna get out of the country as fast as he can .
which means we have a small window of opportunity here .
who' s covering airport and costumes ?
i am .
i' ve issued a mandate to lax , long beach and ontario .
as usual , we can' t hear you .
also , where' s your labtop in case you need to pull data ?
i' m sorry i' m speak up and
i don' t need my labtop , i have everything memorized .
what i was saying is that i have contacted all the airports and security .
do we have any local contacts with sharek ?
we' re looking into those now .
alright .
promote everything we receive up to division .
let' s find sharek before he leaves the city .
let' s go .
excuse me , mrs driscoll .
don' t you think it' s a mistake to assume that sharek is on his way out of l. a. ?
no .
but the timing on the intel doesn' t quite match .
it said 8 a. m. and the train bombing happened around 7 .
just focus on finding sharek .
yes ?
it' s thomas .
did dar get the briefcase ?
yes .
he' s on his radio now .
good .
you did well thomas .
what about maris ?
he' s waiting for you .
he has everything you need .
berous , are you eating with us ?
i' il be right down , mum .
i' m concerned about him .
concerned ?
why ?
i think he' s still seeing this american girl , debbie .
you said you talked to him .
i did .
i told him he was no longer allowed to have contact with her .
and he agreed , right ?
yes , but i think he' s still seeing her behind our backs .
i' il speak to him .
no .
i' il take care of it .
berous , we' re sitting down to eat .
berous ?
i' m on the phone .
get off and come down now .
who was he talking to ?
i don' t know .
sorry .
who were you on the phone with ?
my pal , scott .
you were talking to that american girl .
no , i told you i don' t see her anymore .
don' t lie to me , berous .
i hear your phone calls at night .
i read your e mails .
you read my e mails ?
that' s my business !
don' t you raise your voice to your father !
while you live under my roof , there' s no such thing as your business .
no more communications with that girl .
do you understand me ?
don' t look at her you' re talking to me .
yes , sir . ... horrible tragedy occured a short time ago .
an early morning communer train collided with a pickup truck that was apparently crossing the track .
most of the passengers were severely injured .
30
ntsp have arrived at the scene and are investigating the cause .
at this time , the authorities are not saying whether this was an accident or a targetted attack but as you can there has been a ...
so far , everything is on schedule .
have yo spoken to thomas ?
yes , the briefcase is on its way to us now .
when it gets here , you' il take it to the warehouse .
why doesn' t omar take it directly ?
he doesn' t need to know where our people are working .
that' s the safest way .
berous , if your father seem sevre , it' s because our job here is a difficult one .
if we are to succeed , it' s important that we are of a single mind .
i understand .
what we will accomplish today will change the world .
we' re fortunate that our family has been chosen to do this .
we cannot fail .
yes , father .
morning , jennifer .
morning .
what are you doing here so early ?
i' m not here early .
been here all night ?
yeah .
what are you working on ?
nothing right now .
i' m just stealing some software from adobe and microsoft .
you' re gonna get caught one day .
hey , mel !
don' t tell anybody or i' d have to kill you .
what the hell is this ?
wow !
melany , come look at his !
looks like someone' s trying corrupt the internet .
yeah , but it hasn' t start propagating yet .
they' re just placing the nodes .
look at this !
this thing could tank every system in the world !
you' ve gotta tell somebody .
if i call the feds from here , they' il trace the call , they' il know i was stealing code .
then do it from a payphone .
yeah .
no , i' m up to speed on the train bombing .
how many confirmed dead ?
i didn' t know that .
i will .
thanks , sal .
32 dead .
what' s the initial assessment ?
an act of terrorism .
when you get to ctu , i want you to find out all the details and call me .
yes , sir .
and listen ,
i don' t want anyone except the two of you to know about this meeting with richard .
of course .
i tried to get ahold of you last night .
where were you ?
i had dinner with a friend .
anyone i know ?
no .
jack .
sir .
i' il call you when i get to ctu .
yeah , i' il get it .
hold on .
o' brian .
chlo , it' s edgar stiles .
edgar , you don" t need to use your last name .
you' ve been here over a month .
what is it ?
okay ...
i' ve got someone on the other line who says he' s a friend of yours and needs to talk to you .
who , edgar ?
his name is andrew page .
fine .
put him through .
okay .
hello ?
andrew , you know i can' t take personal calls here .
it' s not personal .
i found something on the net i think you should know about .
what ?
there' s a fake nat table and several large burped routers .
it was loaded this morning .
how would you know that ?
i was trying to download some software and i noticed it .
and by download i assume you mean steal .
otherwise you wouldn' t even see the nat table .
okay , fine .
but i hacked deeper and i found all kinds of stuff .
what kind of stuff ?
i think someone' s positioning code for a major internet attack .
the thing is that not all the code remarks are in english .
what language were they in ?
i don' t know .
looked middle eastern .
like arabic or turkish maybe .
you find something ?
yeah , cyril' s working on the list of known contacts of sharek .
this is maris landstraf .
he owns a drycleaners in studio city .
we dug into the records and found his business is owned by an holding company based ou t of ankarah , turkey .
alright .
give this to ronnie , tell him to get over there and see what he can find .
excuse me , mrs. driscoll .
what is it , chlo ?
i just got a call from an old classmate , andrew page .
he noticed that a number of high profile internet nodes were compromized .
i think this could be related to our present threat .
what makes you say that ?
a computer network virus was launched this morning from a server somewhere in turkey .
that' s where sharek is from ?
should i start working it up ?
no .
the bombing and sharek are all we should be dealing with now .
but pass it to the fbl .
excuse me , sir .
can i help you ?
yes i have a scheduled meeting with erin driscoll .
jack !
it' s okay , sarah .
this is jack bauer .
oh !
m. bauer .
i' m sorry .
no , that' s fine .
chlo , how have you been ?
not perfect but okay , i guess .
how are kim and chase ?
good .
they just got a house in valencia .
kim is taking care of angela .
chase is working for a private security company .
that' s interesting .
i mean , i' m interested , i just have to set up a protocol .
yeah ...
jack .
curtis !
is erin ready for our meeting ?
almost .
but i should tell you , you' re prbably gonna get cut short today .
the train bombing in santa clarita .
among other things .
what other things ?
i wouldn' t worry with it .
we' re out .
okay , we' il have you in voice 3 , data 4 .
alright .
ronnie , this is jack bauer .
jack , ronnie mabel .
nice to meet you .
hey , jack .
ronnie' s got your old job , head of field ops .
yeah , i know .
how' s it going ?
it' s busy .
nice meeting you .
look , would you rather reschedule this ?
no , it won' t be necessary .
erin will be free in a couple minutes .
i' il tell you what .
what don' t you use the station ?
make any calls .
it won' t be long .
okay .
thank you .
i don' t know , max .
let me find out .
i' m on with a representant from vandemburg .
he wants to know how long he' il be pushed back today .
don' t change anything with vandemburg .
we' il stick to the original schedule .
okay , max , yeah .
we' il see you then .
have you spoken with your brother ?
no , i don' t think he even knows i' m coming with you today .
that' s probably best that he doesn' t .
alright , i' il stay in the car .
dad , look ... even if richard does go to this protest .
it' s not the end of the world .
it' s not a page 1 story .
that' s not the point .
it' s an embarassment to me an to the president .
what are you gonna say to him ?
i have no idea .
the thing that gets to me is that he doesn' t know the first thing about the politics of all this .
he' s just doing it to rebel against you .
when did i become the enemy ?
what did i do ?
nothing !
richard' s acting like a spoiled child .
he' s gonna have to grow up some day .
audrey raines .
the president is calling for secretary heller .
yeah .
it' s the president' s office .
hello .
please hold for the president .
james .
yes , mr. president .
james , i' m thinkiong about raising the terror alert level .
because of the train bombing out here ?
no , not just that .
langley has picked up some chatter .
we also have intel on some watchlisted individuals who' ve gotten into the country .
well , my insttinct is to wait until the ntsp waves in on the bombing .
in the meantime , we can increase our state of readiness .
alright , i' il take that into consideration .
i' m meeting with the secretary of state and director shay in a few minutes .
i' il see if they feel the same about it .
yes , mr. president .
thank you .
hello , erin .
hello , jack .
i' m sorry secretary heller couldn' t be here today .
it' s just as well .
as i' m sure you were told , we have a protocol in progress .
so , why don' t we just go down the items and get it over with ?
that' s fine with me .
i' il be direct with you , jack .
i didn' t like the budget your boss proposed .
what' s the problem ?
well , the department of defence is asking for 85 % of all inter agency moneys which is very little for ctu .
if you want a bigger piece of the pie , you' re gonna have to justify it .
i have a proposal for you .
you want to use satellite surveillance for all the traffic at the harbor ?
yes .
problem ?
yes , it' s insufficient .
you need to maintain bodies on the ground .
too expensive .
not if you utilize intelligence from the other agencies .
i' m not gonna have secretary heller sign off on a budget taht doesn' t make sense .
i' il talk to heller about it myself .
no , you' il talk to me .
we' re not doing this twice .
erin , ronnie has arrived at landshaff' s drycleaners .
where' s the feed ?
it' il be on channel one as soon as he sets the hidden camera .
excuse me , jack .
okay , here we go .
stand down until i give you order .
aaron , go round the back .
sean , you go take the side .
hello ?
can i help you ?
you must be mr. landstraf .
do i know you ?
my name is ronnie labell .
i' m with los angeles ctu .
i need to ask you a few questions .
what do you know about a man named thomas sharek ?
i don' t know this man .
really ?
it' s in your records that you contacted him in the last few days .
it wasn' t me .
i run a legitimate business here .
i never said you business wasn' t legitimate , sir .
you can' t just walk in here and harrass me .
he' s hiding something .
it' s beeing handled , jack .
erin , listen to me .
this store is open for business but the blinds are closed .
there' s no other employees .
this guys is way too nervous .
trust me .
he' s hiding something .
turn back a little momment , please .
says here you open at 6 a. m. have you been here the entire time ?
yes .
what' s this about ?
right there .
did you see that ?
yeah .
tell him to look for something on his right .
ronnie .
on his right , see if someone could be hiding .
do you mind i i take a look behind that counter ?
yes , i do mind .
look , this is my store and i want you to walk ou now .
sir , i' m not walking out of there until i take a look ...
jerk !
got him !
great job .
remember , dad , we' re on a tight schedule today .
richard .
dad .
hello .
hey , it' s me .
hey .
aren' t you supposed to be in your meeting with driscoll ?
yeah .
she had to step away .
listen , ctu' s just picked up a prime suspect in the train bombing .
they' re bringing him in for questioning now .
my father' s still in with richard .
that' s all right .
i' il brief him later .
i just wanted to let you know .
all right .
that' s good news .
yeah .
yeah , i think so .
all right ... um , i' il talk to you later .
wait .
wait .
what is it ?
look , about earlier ...
i don' t want you to think that that made me uncomfortable .
it' s just that since teri died , i never thought i' d ...
jack , it' s all right .
i understand .
no .
no , you don' t .
i just want you to know that ...
i' m falling in love with you , too .
wow .
um , you caught me off guard .
yeah .
sorry about that .
look , driscoll' s coming back .
i gotta go .
then go .
okay .
i' il talk to you when i get a break .
all right .
what' s happening with the suspect ?
ronnie' s bringing him in .
who is he ?
fortunately , for you , jack , it' s our problem , not yours .
right .
i' m going , dad .
and there' s nothing you can to do stop me .
how many cars do you need to get places ?
i didn' t come here to argue about the environment , richard .
i didn' t ask you to come at all .
i do not want you to attend or to speak at that rally at lockheed this afternoon .
you don' t have any leverage over what i do anymore .
you haven' t since i stopped taking your money .
can' t you ever think of anything besides yourself ?
if you do this , it will humiliate the president , and it will be dangerous to national security .
what could be more dangerous than 2, 500 missile delivery systems ?
oh , spare me your sixth grade michael moore logic .
the world is a little bit more complicated than that , richard .
we do not live in a utopia .
america has enemies .
enemies who were our friends a year ago .
and in another year , it' il change again , unless people stop supporting your psychotic need to control the world .
psychotic need ? !
we serve our country !
we serve the cause of freedom !
what do you do ? !
why don' t you just go back to your little motorcade and drive somewhere where people actually buy the lies you' re selling ?
okay , look , look , we don' t have to do this , okay ?
we do not have to .
fine , dad .
what do you want to do ?
do not disrespect me .
i am your father .
nothing .
it was my friend , not me .
what' s his name ?
andrew .
andrew what ?
andrew paige .
who did you tell ?
i swear , we didn' t tell anyone .
i don' t know .
don' t lie to me .
i don' t know !
he just stumbled on the site and logged out !
don' t lie to me !
where is andrew paige now ?
i was just doing my work i don' t ...
you can use station five .
chloe' s opened up a socket for you .
you' il be able to access the records volume to look at those budget numbers .
okay , fine .
i know this guy .
who , sherek ?
we were tracking him when i was here .
we knew him as jann bolek .
we linked him to over a dozen complicated bombings in europe in the late ' 90s .
unfortunately , we weren' t able to stop him from today' s attack .
but we did catch him .
and , jack , i' m sorry i was abrupt before .
you helped us with the takedown .
thank you .
erin , listen to me .
this doesn' t make sense .
i know this guy' s file .
he' s a major handler .
he wouldn' t risk exposing himself here in the united states for a train bombing .
it' s not big enough .
we' il take that into consideration when we interrogate him .
give my best to secretary heller .
chloe .
what ?
the original data that you pulled up on sherek , was there any indication of a secondary strike ?
no .
everything supports that he was here for the train bombing .
but there was a time discrepancy .
what do you mean ?
there was some high probability chatter indicating an attack at 8 : 00 a . m .
the train bombing happened at 7 : 00 .
they didn' t give a window ?
they actually called for a specific time ?
yeah , but the intel was off by an hour .
driscoll thought it was close enough .
you can' t do that .
what' s your log on i. d. for interpol overnights ?
i' m not comfortable doing this .
chloe , please .
you' re in .
is this the source ?
yes .
that' s the decipher .
calls for an 8 : 00 strike
... unless target deviates . " that doesn' t make sense .
trains don' t deviate , they' re on a fixed course and schedule .
sometimes when interpol' s breaking codes and communiques , it won' t use the exact wording .
what are you thinking , jack ?
sherek didn' t come here for a train bombing .
something' s going to happen at 8 : 00 .
that' s ten minutes from now .
no , paul , i don' t want to wait .
i' m going to call my lawyer as soon as we get back to d. c. and we' re going to get this divorce process moving .
well , what' s the hurry ?
we said we' d take a year apart and see what happened .
yeah , but it' s almost been a year .
i don' t want to wait any longer .
hang on .
look , i got to take this call .
we' il talk when i back to d. c.
yeah , fine .
all right , bye .
jack .
hey , i need to speak with your father .
he' s still in with richard .
he doesn' t want to be interrupted .
this is urgent .
i need him to get me clearance so i can interrogate the suspect in the train bombing .
driscoll won' t let me anywhere near him .
i believe he' s got information about a secondary hit , a larger one .
supposed to take place this morning at 8 : 00 .
well , it' s almost 8 : 00 now .
i know , that' s why i need to speak with him .
all right , hang on .
i' m going to speak at that rally this afternoon , dad .
and it' s not because i hate you .
it' s ' cause it' s something i believe in .
did it ever occur to you that these people are using you ?
don' t you realize they' re letting you speak for one reason and one reason only , because you are my son !
well , i wish i weren' t .
what is it , audrey ?
i' m sorry , it' s jack .
it' s urgent .
excuse me , richard .
what could be more important than intimidating me ?
i didn' t know you were hiding in the car .
richie , why are you doing this to dad ?
can' t you just back off ?
i' m not doing anything to him .
you know if you go to that protest at lockheed it' s going to hurt him .
whatever it takes to stop what he' s doing .
jack , if i step on driscoll' s toes and it doesn' t pay off , all of a sudden , i have ton of political fallout to deal with .
sir , i understand that .
but i wouldn' t be asking you this if i didn' t believe there was an imminent threat to national security that i could help avert .
share your concerns with driscoll .
let ctu handle it .
sir , there isn' t time .
it' s the president .
jack , it' s the president .
i' ve got to go .
yes , sir .
damn .
how long you been in los angeles ?
who are you working with ?
we don' t have time for this .
okay , you listen to me .
unless you start giving me some answers right now , you' re going to end up in a hole for the next 30 years .
who are you working with ? !
why did you bomb that train ? !
how far can i push this guy ?
we have to find out who he' s working with .
should go as far as we have to .
maybe we should bring johnson in .
sorry , sir , this area' s off limits .
oh , i' m looking for erin driscoll .
jack !
jack , what are you doing ?
call security now .
what is happening at 8 : 00 ?
son of a bitch , he' s jammed the codes .
i am not messing with you .
you are going to tell me ... what is happening at 8 : 00 ? !
jack , holster your weapon !
jack !
i said holster your weapon !
call medical .
what is your primary objective ? !
i' il order security to shoot you if i have to .
get that door open .
what is your primary objective ? !
secretary of defense !
heller .
secretary heller ?
yes .
secretary heller' s the target .
call secret service now .
call now .
get a team on the way .
yeah , i' il hold .
the president wants us back in d. c. tonight .
what meetings can we eject ?
not vandenberg .
the media' s expecting you there .
maybe we skip paradigm , and handle that with a teleconference next week .
come on , pick up the phone !
tell the president we' il we rearrange our schedule and fly back this afternoon .
yeah .
audrey , it' s jack .
are you still at richard' s ?
yeah .
you need to get your father out of there now !
the bombing this morning was diversiory !
your father is the real target !
you' ve got to get out of there now !
target ? !
audrey !
oh , my god .
audrey !
