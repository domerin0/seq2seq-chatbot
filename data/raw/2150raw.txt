you' re back already .
the mailman left money for you .

i' il let you run around .
but don' t run away .
you promise ?

excuse me .
my dog ran away .
call her .
she' s yours .
was it you ?
for the vet .
you found my address ?
that was easy .
you don' t know the prices .
it cost 130 francs .
you sent me 600 .
wait .
i' il get the change .
what about rita ?
she' s a very intelligent dog .
take her .
you don' t want her ?
i want nothing .
then stop breathing .
good idea .
you don' t breathe anymore ?
if you don' t come , you' il never see me again .
but today is sunday .
yesterday was saturday and we were together .
i' m sorry , sir .
we' re about to have lunch .
i ask one thing of you : don' t call me " sir " .
talk to me like yesterday .
call me pierrot .
call me " my love " .
say " my love " ...
sir , let me change rooms .
pierre , i' m alone now .
so am i.
far from you .
i want you to come .
i can' t be alone ...
i saw you yesterday .
i miss you too .
understand that .
i don' t want to .
i' m thinking of you .
you' re naked in front of the mirror .
but for someone else , not for me .
i want to kiss you .
i lean forward ,
i touch your lips ...
what are you doing ?
i' m spying .
what ?
i' m listening to my neighbors ' phone calls .
you cut it off just as it was getting interesting .
you don' t find it entertaining ?
it' s disgusting .
yes .
what' s more , it' s illegal .
your 30 francs .
one minute , miss .
you' re persuaded you are right .
yes .
then why don' t you do anything ?
what ?
can' t i touch your scar ,
like yesterday ?
go see this man .
tell him someone listens to his conversations .
while you' re at it , tell him it' s me .
i will .
it' s that house .
may i see your husband ?
he' s upstairs on the phone .
let me shut off the gas .
come in , please .
have a seat .
he' il be right down .
caroline , don' t play ... ... with the phone .
daddy' s talking .
excuse me .
i' m at the wrong address .
this is number 22 .
i' m very sorry .
no problem .
have a nice day .
goodbye .
i' il call you later .
you lost this .
so ?
did you tell him ?
would you like something to drink ?
no , i wouldn' t .
i came back ...
i came back to ask you something .
don' t do this any more .
i' ve done it all my life .
what were you ?
a cop ?
worse .
a judge .
a judge ?
you' ve never seen one for real ?
would you like to try ?
it makes ... a lovely sound .
i don' t know whether i was on the good or the bad side .
here , at least , i know where the truth is .
my point of view is better than in a courtroom .
no .
everyone deserves a private life .
of course .
why did you stop short ?
why didn' t you tell him ?
because he has a sweet wife , devoted to him ?
and a little daughter who loves him ?
so you couldn' t .
did you feel remorse ... or were you afraid to do harm ?
maybe both .
let me tell you .
it matters little whether i spy or you tell them .
sooner or later , he' il jump out a window , or she' il find out everything .
someone will tell their daughter and it will be living hell .
what can we do about it ?
why are you so quiet ?
does this remind you of something ?
yes .
what ?
say it .
a boy i know .
a boy you know who ... found out his mother was a whore ?
who learned ... he' s not his father' s son .
he was fifteen .
that man' s daughter ... she knows too .
stay a minute .
why ?
the light is beautiful .
personal weather reports .
i' m driving to turin tomorrow .
i checked .
the weather will be fine to chamonix .
from chamonix to the tunnel , it may snow .
and after the tunnel ... one minute ...
i know the weather all over europe .
up to turin , the weather will be fine .
leave early to avoid the snow .
this service is a great idea .
thank you .
goodbye .
personal weather reports .
it' s me .
did you get any sleep ?
a little .
i didn' t tell you .
by telephone it may be easier .
it was really great .
we' d never made love so well , so long .
we learned something .
me from you .
you from me .
when i woke up , you were still sleeping .
like a child .
i' m older than you .
one year !
no , two .
okay .
two .
when i saw you , i got scared .
what is this leading to ?
you sound a little down .
are you nervous about your exams ?
about what i' m going to do .
will it be enough for you ?
why not go bowling ?
i opened all my books .
maybe .
do you have a coin ?
yes .
flip it .
tails is bowling .
heads is penal code .
tails .
bowling .
i' il work for an hour , then i' il call you .
or i will .
i' il wait .
if i go out , it' s just to buy cigarettes .
you didn' t listen ?
what a shame .
it was romantic .
i heard the beginning .
they' re in love .
yes .
he hasn' t met the right woman yet .
how do you know ?
i watch them from my window .
you think i' m a bastard ?
yes .
come look .
he bought a telephone in japan that uses another wavelength .
my radio can' t pick it up .
too bad .
i think he' s responsible for most of the heroin trade in geneva .
we have nothing on him .
he never takes risks .
do you like him ?
very much .
i' il call him .
you have his phone number ?
you deserve to die .
what did i do ?
here' s his phone number .
if you feel like saying mean things to him , don' t hesitate .
at 10 o' clock , i turned off the lights .
i couldn' t sleep .
next program .
not very interesting .
i kept tossing and turning .
it kept hurting .
it still does .
i haven' t done the errands .
i' m sorry , mother .
i have no milk or bread .
i bought you some .
i put it in the freezer .
i ate it all .
you didn' t eat 7 loaves ... ... in 4 days .
i' m sick of this .
go do her errands .
maybe you' d feel better .
maybe she' s the one ... ... who' d feel better .
why did you pick up rita ?
because i' d run over her .
she was bleeding .
otherwise , you' d have felt guilty .
you' d have dreamt of a dog with a crushed skull .
yes .
so who did you do it for ?
don' t bother doing that lady' s errands .
she has everything she needs .
she wants to see her daughter .
she already came 5 times , when her mother faked a heart attack .
after she dies , i' il have to call the daughter .
she doesn' t believe her any more .
you' re mistaken .
about what ?
about everything .
everything .
people aren' t bad .
it' s not true .
yes .
they may be weak sometimes ...
the boy who learned his father wasn' t his father ... your boyfriend or your brother ?
my brother .
how old is he ?
16 .
how long has he been shooting up ?
how do you know ?
it wasn' t hard to guess .
i can only feel pity for you .
maybe you don' t know .
your dog is pregnant .
it' s valentine .
hello , darling .
mom , did marc come ?
two days ago .
with his girlfriend .
do you know her ?
yes .
marie .

marc !
he' s coming .
call me , mom .
i love you .
hi , valentine .
thanks for going there .
we' re leaving tomorrow .
i can' t stand it .

you should go home .
bye .

please , call me .
dld you see the picture ?
the picture ?

you didn' t see it ?
i forgot .
i' ve had a hard day .

it' il relax you .
where ?
not bad !
i' m sorry to bother you ...
someone played a stupid prank .
i can' t get in .
those kids ...
turks .
always trouble .
i don' t know .
they stuck chewing gum in my lock .
tweezers .
it' s me .
michel ...
i just called .
there was no answer .
someone stuck chewing gum in my lock .
i heard the phone .
chewing gum ?
i did an ad for chewing gum .
that must be why .
i told you not to .
they take advantage of you .
forget it .
there was no answering machine .
all i want is peace .
a life of peace and quiet .
life won' t be peaceful with me .
did you meet someone ?
no .
i' m waiting for you .
why didn' t you answer before ?
i told you .
i couldn' t get inside .
i understand .
how are you ?
i' m going to hungary next week .

i' m going to bed .
go ahead !
go on !

michel , are you there ?
it' s starting again ...
are you asleep ?
no , i' m not .
get into bed .
are you in bed ?
i' m taking a shower .
i was getting undressed .
no one is helping you ?
valentine , are you there ?
no .
goodnight .
i knew you' d make it .
did they ask the question ?
from the book you dropped in the street .
you don' t like it ?
yes .
very much .
what will be the first judgement i sign ?
civil hearing .
the inhabitants of pinchat against joseph kern .
please enter .
i' d like number 432 .
van den budenmayer .
did i pronounce it right ?
yes .
this one ?
i just sold the last one .
i' il have others this afternoon .
i can set one aside .
whose paper is this ?
yours .
i came ...
i saw the newspaper ...
i want you to know i didn' t tell a soul .
i know .
no one .
not the police .
no one .
i know .
i know who it was .
who ?
it was me .
you asked me to .
won' t you come in ?
let me show you something .
one , two , three , four , five , six .
seven ?
seven .
won' t you have some pear brandy ?
i' ve had it for ages , but i' ve never had an occasion .
to my health .
why did you do it ?
why did i turn myself in ?
yes .
to see what you' d do once you saw it in your paper .
you thought ... ... i would come ?
after our last conversation , i thought so .
why ?
do you expect something from me ?
yes .
before you left , you mentioned pity .
afterwards , i realized it was disgust .
will you sit down for a moment ?
will you smile for me ?
the day you left , you cried .
i cried .
and i shut off my radio .
i sat down at my desk .
the fountain pen i' d used all my life was out of ink , so i took a pencil and wrote letters to my neighbors and to the police .
i mailed them that evening .
while you were sleeping soundly .
i wasn' t sleeping .
i had gone bowling .
do you remember that couple' s conversation ?
the boy and the girl ?
i remember .
they wanted to go too .
that same evening .
maybe you were right next to them .
maybe .
you didn' t like her .
it' s almost over .
i was right .
you seem happy about it .
did you provoke it ?
yes or no ?
because of my eavesdropping and my trial , the girl met another man .
good day .
since then , she' s been alone .
i asked my brother to go see her .
he stayed three days .
in one week i' m going to england .
i' m abandoning my mother and my brother .
every day he gets a little worse .
i shouldn' t leave .
leave .
it' s your destiny .
you can' t live your brother' s life for him .
i love him .
if only i could help .
you can .
be .
what do you mean ?
that' s all : be .
do you like flying ?
then take the ferry .
i' ve never taken one .
it' s less expensive and healthier .
that' s a good idea .
do you like it ?
today is my birthday .
i didn' t know .
35 years ago today , at about the same time , 5 o' clock ,
i acquitted a man .
a sailor .
one of my first big cases .
it was a tough time in my life .
i have since realized i made a mistake .
he was guilty .
i' m all out of bulbs .
what happened to him ?
i did my own investigation .
he' s married with three children .
a grandson .
he is living in peace .
so you did what was necessary .
and you did it well .
don' t you understand ?
you saved him .
perhaps .
but how many others could i have acquitted ?
even guilty ?
deciding what is true and what isn' t now seems to me ... ... a lack of modesty .
vanity ?
vanity .
can i have a drop ?
to you !
if i had to go to court ... are there still judges like you ?
you won' t go to court .
justice doesn' t deal with the innocent .
see that ?
it' s the sixth window they' ve broken .
the wavelength has been changed .
i can no longer eavesdrop .
where is the broom ?
in the kitchen closet .
put the stone on the piano .
you' re not afraid ?
i wonder what i' d do in their place .
the same thing .
you' d throw stones ?
in their place ?
of course .
and that goes for everyone i judged .
given their lives , i would steal ,
i' d kill , i' d lie .
of course i would .
all that because i wasn' t ... ... in their shoes , but mine .
is there someone you love ?
have you ever loved ?
yesterday i dreamt ...
i dreamt of you .
you were 40 or 50 years old , and you were happy .
do your dreams come true ?
it' s been years since i dreamt something nice .
stay there !
i bought a ticket for the ferry .
i arrive in england next wednesday .
at 7 : 30 a . m .
why the ferry ?
so i can visit my mother near calais .
i' il meet you at 8 : 00 .
i' m happy you' re coming .
michel , tell me ... do you love me ?
i think so .
you love me or you think so ?
it' s the same thing .
the battery .
auguste !
personal weather reports .
i' ve tried calling for a few days .
i was sick .
i' m sorry .
what will the weather be on the english channel next week ?
wonderful .
sunny , a slight breeze , chilly in the morning .
why are you laughing ?
i intend to go there .
even farther .
for your work ?
no , for pleasure .
on a yacht .
it' s a nice sail .
yes , very .
you' il be closing ?
i' il have to .
that' s too bad .
it was a good idea .
goodbye .
we told you not to smile !
be serious !
can you send an invitation to this address ?
just one person ?
are you okay ?
so long .
have a good time .
there' s no make up remover ?
here .
everyone noticed ... ... that guy .
during the entire show i kept staring at him .
you came .
you knew the invitation came from me ?
i' d hoped so .
did you look for me ?
during the entire show .
i' m leaving tomorrow .
i wanted to say goodbye .
goodbye .
i' d like you to tell me in detail ... ... the dream you had .
you were 50 years old and you were happy .
in this dream ... was there someone else ?
there was .
who ?
you woke up and you smiled at someone next to you .
i don' t know who .
that' s what will happen ?
in 20 or 25 years ?
yes .
what else do you know ?
who are you ?
a retired judge .
i feel something important is happening around me .
and it scares me .
is that better ?
i used to come here often .
where did you usually sit ?
where i sat today .
that' s why you couldn' t see me .
one day , during the intermission , the elastic holding my books broke .
one of them , a big one , fell down ... somewhere around here .
it was just before my exams .
i ran down immediately .
the book had opened to a certain page .
i read a few sentences .
it was the question they asked during my exam .
getting out of the house did you good .
i had to recharge the battery .
it was dead .
the storm .
lousy coffee .
i was wondering ... ... why you mentioned that sailor .
do you know why ?
yes .
because ... ... you didn' t want to tell me something more important .
about the woman that you loved .
she betrayed you .
she betrayed you , and you never understood why .
and you kept on loving her .
how do you know all this ?
it wasn' t hard to guess .
what was she like ?
she graduated two years before me .
she was blond , delicate , radiant , with a long neck .
her clothing and her furniture were all light colored .
in the foyer there was a mirror in a white frame .
it was in that mirror , one night , that i saw her white legs spread , with a man between them .
why ... ... did that happen ?
do you know ?
this man , whose name was hugo holbling ,
could offer her what she wanted .
they left .
i followed them .
i crossed france , the channel ...
i was ... humiliated .
until the day she died in an accident .
since then , i' ve never loved another woman .
yes .
i stopped believing .
maybe i never met the woman ...
maybe you' re the woman i never met .
the story doesn' t end there .
no .
a while ago ,
i was given a difficult case .
hugo holbling .
the same man .
he' d come back here .
i' m closing up .
did you see a woman with a bucket ?
the storm flooded the wardrobe .
if you see her , tell her i' m upstairs .
you shouldn' t have taken the case .
i didn' t want to .
at first , i wanted to kill him .
i would have , if it would have changed something .
now , he was waiting for my verdict .
he was building a covered market which caved in .
several people died .
i said he was guilty .
it was a legal sentence .
afterwards , i asked for early retirement .
did you see her ?
i' m always running after her !
milana !
there you are !
give me the buckets .
they' re heavy .
you seemed to like my pear brandy .
i have another favor to ask you .
i' il be gone two or three weeks .
i' il come see you afterwards .
please give me one of the puppies .
will the fashion show be on tv ?
probably .
i better buy a tv .
i have one i never use .
my brother can bring it to you .
his name is marc .
i' d like to meet him .
i' il see you soon .
goodbye .
do you have your ticket ?
where do i go ?
this deck .
that corridor .
excuse me , i' m lost .
f38 ?
