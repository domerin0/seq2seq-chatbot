they were screaming at each other for 2 hours .
nothing new .
then they heard the gun go off .
both barrels .
a crime of passion .
yeah .
just look at all the passion on that wall .
this is a done deal .
all but the paperwork .
did the kid see it ?
what ?
the kid .
what kind of question' s that ?
we' il be glad to get rid of you , somerset .
always these questions .
did the kid see it ?
who gives a fuck ?
he' s dead .
his wife killed him .
the rest is nothing to do with us .
detective somerset ?
i' m detective mills .
i get in town 20 minutes ago , they dump me here .
look ...
mills ?
let' s find a bar , sit and talk ...
i' d like to get to the precinct .
not much time for this transition thing .
i had a question , when we spoke on the phone .
yeah ?
why here ?
i don' t follow .
all this effort to get transferred .
it' s the first question that popped into my head .
same reasons as you , or the reasons you had before you decided to quit .
you just met me .
maybe i don' t understand the question .
it' s very simple .
you actually fought to get reassigned here .
i never saw it done that way .
thought i' d do some good .
be great if we didn' t start out kicking each other in the balls .
you' re calling the shots .
yes .
i want you to look and listen , okay ?
i wasn' t guarding a taco bell .
i worked homicide 5 years .
not here .
i understand .
over the next 7 days , do me a favor and remember that .
yeah .
okay .
say it again ?
i thought we moved here to get away from tractor pulls .
serpico' s got to go .
you might want to get rid of ... this crusty .
this eye , serpico .
did you get it ?
got it .
good .
coffee ?
no ?
nothing' s been touched .
it' s all like i found it .
what time was death established ?
like i said ,
i didn' t touch anything , but he' s had his face in spaghetti for 45 minutes .
no one bothers with vital signs ?
did i stutter ?
he ain' t breathing unless he' s breathing spaghetti sauce .
that' s how it' s done around here ?
i beg your pardon , detective , but the guy' s sitting in a pile of his own piss and shit .
if he wasn' t dead , he would have stood up by now .
alright .
thank you , officer .
thank you .
i wonder ... what was the point of that conversation ?
i don' t know .
how many times barney five found dead bodies that weren' t dead ?
drop it .
phone guinness .
i think we got a record here .
better homes and gardens .
who said this was murder ?
no one .
guy' s heart must be the size of a canned ham .
if this isn' t a coronary , well ,
i don' t know .
whoops .
how about that ?
we had this case once , guy dead on the ground , knife in his back .
murder , right ?
fuck .
big insurance policy involved .
guy took the tip of the blade , stuck it in his own shoulder blades .
he must have screwed up because there were ... ... multiples back there .
please be quiet .
wait a minute .
what ?
we got a bucket here .
what' s in it ?
my god !
fucking vomit !
any blood in it ?
i didn' t see any .
help yourself .
are you thinking it' s poison ?
oh , wonderful .
very moody .
think it' s poison , somerset ?
you girls have got forensics waiting outside .
we might not fit .
there' s room .
light' s the problem .
how are you ?
detective mills , go help the officers question the neighbors .
what ?
and send in forensics .
he' s dead .
thank you , doctor .
you saw my files , the things i' ve done ?
nope .
i did door to doors , walked the beat , all that shit ... a long time .
and ?
my badge says ...
detective " , same as yours .
look , i made a decision .
i had to consider the integrity of the crime scene , not whether you were getting enough time in the field .
hey , man ...
just don' t jerk me off .
that' s all i ask .
he' s been dead ... a long time , and not from poison .
oh , man .
how can you let yourself go like this ?
it took four orderlies just to get him on the table .
how' d the fat fuck fit out his door ?
it' s obvious he was a shut in .
see how big this stomach is ?
strange thing is , it stretches .
look , the size of the cardiac orifice , where the food ...
i see that , but it means nothing to me .
he' s got lines of distention across the duodenum .
the interior wall' s ripped open .
this man ate till he burst ?
no , he didn' t burst all the way .
he was hemorrhaging internally .
there was a hematoma in the rectus and ... ... the abdominal muscles .
he did die by eating ?
yes and no .
what about these bruises here ?
i haven' t figured that out yet .
gun pressed against his head ?
pressed hard enough .
fuck , yeah .
on the front , flush with the muzzle .
ladies and gentlemen , we have a homicide .
killer put a bucket under him .
took his time , too .
coroner said it could' ve lasted 12 hours .
victim' s throat was swollen , probably from the effort , and there was a point when he passed out .
that' s when the killer kicked him , ... and he burst .
sadistic fucker .
when you want somebody dead , you drive by and shoot .
you don' t risk the time it takes for this , unless the act itself has meaning .
somebody had a problem with a fat boy and tortured him .
simple .
in the grocer bags , we found two receipts .
so the killer went back ... to the supermarket .
so ?
it' s his thing .
i' ve been out in the rain .
this is a beginning .
we' ve got ... one dead guy , not three .
no motive .
don' t start that big brain of yours ... cooking on this , alright ?
i' d like to be reassigned .
whoa !
what are you talking about ?
this can' t be my last duty .
it' il go on and on .
you' re retiring in 6 days .
you' ve left unfinished business before .
the cases were taken as close as possible to conclusion .
may i speak freely ?
we' re friends here .
it shouldn' t be his first case .
i knew it .
it' s not my first assignment , you dick .
it' s too soon for him .
you can say that shit to my face .
captain ?
it' s too soon for you .
captain , can we talk in private ?
this is a personal thing ...
just shut up , mills .
i don' t have anyone else to put on this .
this is metro .
you don' t just get to swap .
give it to me .
what ?
he wants out , fuck him .
see you , have a nice time .
give it to me .
i' il put you on something else .
go on , mills , just go on .
i' m sorry , old buddy , but it looks like you' re stuck cleaning up the fat man .
quiet down .
alright , calm down , calm down .
quiet down .
i' il answer questions for 10 minutes only .
ask those questions in a calm , orderly fashion , or i will leave .
detective ?
can i have a moment ?
no .
i won' t discuss the details of this investigation , so don' t bother asking .
what you got for me ?
nothing yet , boss .
why don' t you guys go get a coffee ?
we have this breaking story .
let' s go downtown , where attorney ,
eli gould , was found murdered today .
da martin talbot is taking questions from reporters .
that' s ridiculous and offensive .
there is no conflict , and any claim there could be is irresponsible .
now hold on .
i just met with law enforcement officials , and they have their very best men on this .
this will be the definition of swift justice .
pardon me , george .
somerset ...
come in .
you heard the news ?
nope , haven' t heard .
eli gould was found murdered this morning .
someone broke into his law firm and bled him to death .
wrote the word " greed " on the floor .
greed ?
yeah , in blood .
mills is heading the investigation .
excuse me .
don' t do that , please ?
good for him .
what will you do ... with yourself out there , somerset ?
i' il work maybe on a farm .
fix my house .
don' t you feel it ?
don' t you feel that feeling ?
you won' t be a cop anymore .
that' s the whole idea .
i don' t think you' il leave .
you can' t leave all this .
guy' s out walking his dog .
gets attacked .
his watch is taken , his wallet .
and while he' s lying on the sidewalk , helpless , his attacker stabs him in both eyes .
this happened last night , four blocks from here .
i read about it .
i don' t understand anymore .
it' s the way it' s always been .
maybe you' re right .
you were made for this work .
you can' t deny that .
maybe i' m wrong .
coroner sent this for you .
found them in the fat boy' s stomach , mixed in with the food .
looks like little pieces ... ... of plastic .
set them on that desk .
they were ... fed to him .
lord .
this was found behind the fridge in the obesity murder scene .
long is the way , and hard , that out of hell leads up to the light .
it' s from milton .
paradise lost
alright ,
i' m confused .
it means that this is a beginning .
this was behind the fridge , written in grease .
there are 7 deadly sins , captain .
gluttony ,
greed , sloth , wrath , pride , lust , and envy .
seven .
hold on .
this is not even my desk .
you can expect 5 more of these .
wait a minute .
i can' t get involved in this .
somerset .
he wanted it .
damn !
i' m all over it .
where to ?
far away from here .
a few things to look up .
okay .
sit where you like .
how' s everybody ?
hiya , smiley .
george , cards are getting cold .
duty calls .
gentlemen .
i' il never understand .
all these books , a world of knowledge , and what do you do ?
play poker all night .
we got culture .
we got culture coming out our asses .
how' s this for culture ?
you know , smiley ... you' il really miss us .
i just might .
fucking dante .
goddamn poetry writing faggot piece of shit .
fucker .
good work , officer .
thank you , lord .
oh , sorry .
i' il move in a second .
you want your chair ?
no , you go ahead .
yeah ?
phone .
package deal .
comes with the office .
mills .
honey .

something wrong ?
dingleberry .
i told you not to call when i' m at work .
yeah .
why ?
why ?
why ?
okay .
it' s my wife .
sorry ?
she' d like to speak to you .
this is detective somerset .
yes , it' s nice to talk to you too .
i appreciate the offer , but ...
in that case , i' d be delighted .
yes , thank you very much .
bye .
honey , what ... ?
well ?
sorry ?
what ?
i' m invited to late supper at your apartment .
i accepted .
at my ... how' s that ?
tonight .
hello , men .
hi , loser .
hi , idiot .
that' s tracy .
hello .
happy to meet you .
i' ve heard a lot about you .
except your first name .
it' s william .
well , it' s a good name .
william .
i' d like you to meet david .
david , this is william .
alright , i' il be right back .
how are the kids ?
good , they' re in the room .
good dogs .
good dogs .
how are you , pretty ?
smells good .
what ?
yeah .
i mean , thanks .
please have a seat , if you like .
would you like a drink ?
no , thanks .
i' il wait .
throw that anywhere .
excuse all this mess .
we' re still unpacking .
i hear you were high school sweethearts .
pretty hokey , huh ?
you know something ?
from the first date , i knew he was ... ... the guy i' d marry .
really ?
he was the funniest guy i' d ever met .
really .
it' s kind of rare nowadays .
i mean , that level ... of commitment .
don' t worry .
i won' t wear it to the table .
you know , no matter how often i see guns ,
i can' t get used to them .
same here .
why aren' t you married , william ?
tracy ...
what the hell ... ?
i was close once .
it just didn' t happen .
it surprises me .
it really does .
well ... anyone who spends much time with me finds me disagreeable .
just ask your husband .
very true .
very , very true .
how long have you lived here ?
too long .
how do you like it ?
you know , takes time .
settle in , it' il be good .
you get numb after a while .
there are things to any city .
subway .
it' il go away in a minute .
real estate guy .
fucking piece of ... sorry honey .
shows us the place a few times , i think he' s good .
he' s efficient .
trace really likes it .
then we wonder why he only brings us here for 5 minutes .
we found out the first night .
the soothing , relaxing ... vibrating home .
i' m sorry .
yeah , alright , laugh it up .
i don' t know why you' re laughing .
alright , already .
he had to get into the building before the office closed .
gould would' ve been working late .
i' m certain .
the biggest defense lawyer in town .
infamous , really .
the body was found on tuesday morning .
the office was closed monday .
he could' ve gotten in friday ,
laid low till the cleaners left , then had his way with gould saturday , sunday , maybe monday .
look .
gould was bound , right arm free .
he was handed a butcher' s knife .
check out the scale .
a pound of flesh .
one pound of flesh , no more , no less .
no cartilage , no bone , only flesh .
merchant of venice
didn' t see it .
this task done , and he would go free .
that chair was ... ... soaked with sweat .
of course .
the killer wanted gould to take his time , deciding which cut to make first .
imagine it .
there' s a gun in your face .
which part of your body is expendable ?
the love handle .
cut along the side of his own stomach .
let' s take a fresh look .
the corpse is there , but ...
iook through it .
edit out your initial shock .
the trick is to find one item , one detail ... and focus on it ... till it' s an exhausted possibility .
i' il get another beer .
beer ?
wine , please .
he' s preaching .
punishing .
the sins were used in medieval sermons .
7 cardinal virtues , 7 deadly sins , ... used as teaching tools .
yeah , like in ...
" the parson' s tale " and dante .
you read them ?
yeah .
parts .
remember in " purgatory
dante and his buddy climb up ... the hill and check out the sinners ?
the 7 terraces of purgation .
yeah , right .
but there , pride comes first , not gluttony .
let' s consider the books as the killer' s inspiration .
the sermons were about atonement for sin .
these murders are like forced attrition .
forced what ?
attrition' s when you regret your sins ... ... but not for love of god .
because of a gun in your face .
no fingerprints .
no .
totally unrelated victims .
and no witnesses .
which i don' t get ... because the fucker had to get back out .
in a major city , minding your business is a science .
in rape prevention , they tell you never to cry for help .
always yell " fire !
nobody answers " help " .
holler " fire " , they' il come .
that' s fucked up .
he must have left another puzzle piece .
thanks for talking this out , but i got to sleep .
i got to walk the dogs .
this is just to satisfy my curiosity .
i' m leaving the end of the week .
shit .
no , wait .
gould' s wife was out of town .
so this means she saw something .
what if it' s a threat ?
i put her in a safehouse .
she wasn' t happy about it .
what if it isn' t what she' s seen , but what she' s supposed to and hasn' t yet ?
yeah , okay .
what ?
i don' t know .
but that' s the one thing .
i' il sign us in .
gotta see mrs. gould .
mrs. gould ?
mrs. gould , i' m sorry .
i truly am .
i don' t understand .
i need you to look at each photo very carefully .
see if anything' s strange , out of place , anything at all .
i don' t see anything .
you' re sure ?
please , i can' t do this right now .
okay .
it' s got to be now .
maybe we missed something .
wait .
what ?
here .
this painting , it' s upside down .
your men didn' t move this ?
no .
those shots were taken before forensics .
nothing .
there' s got to be something .
he moved the screws to re hang it .
what the fuck is that ?
switchblade .
goddamn it .
there must be something .
he didn' t paint the fucking thing .
no , he' s fucking with us .
see this , this is us .
just wait a minute .
somerset' s climbing furniture .
wait a minute .
you' re kidding me .
call the print lab .
oh , man .
honestly ... have you ever seen anything like this ?
no .
the swell pattern tells me they' re not ... the victim' s prints .
i say he' s whacked enough .
it doesn' t fit .
he doesn' t want to stop .
who knows .
freaks doing their evil deeds they don' t want to .
voices made me do it .
my dog made me do it .
jodie foster told me to do it .
it can take ... 3 days to make a match , so maybe you guys want to ... cross your fingers somewhere else .
you meant what you said to mrs. gould , didn' t you ?
about catching this guy .
yeah .
wish i still thought the way you do .
what the hell do you think we' re doing ?
picking up the pieces .
collecting evidence , taking pictures and samples , writing everything down , noting the times things happened .
that' s all ?
that' s all .
putting everything into neat piles ... and filing it , on the off chance it' il be needed in a courtroom .
picking up diamonds on a desert island , saving them in case we get rescued .
bullshit .
even the most promising clues only lead to others .
so many corpses roll away , unrevenged .
don' t tell me you didn' t get that rush tonight .
i saw you .
we' re getting somewhere .
wake up , glimmer twins .
we got a winner .
he uses the name victor .
theodore allen .
homicide found his prints at the scene .
he' s got a long history of serious mental illness .
he got a very strict , southern baptist upbringing .
somewhere along the line , they fell short .
victor dabbled in drugs , armed robbery and assault .
spent time in prison for attempted rape of a minor .
his lawyer made sure that didn' t last long .
by the way , the lawyer was eli gould , the " greed " victim .
we' re finishing this today , ladies and germs .
victor' s been out of circulation , but we have a residence for him .
you' re not buying this .
doesn' t seem like ... ... our guy , does it ?
you tell me .
our killer seems to have more purpose .
you ever take a bullet ?
never in my 34 years .
knock wood .
i' ve only taken my gun out three times , intending to use it .
never pulled the trigger .
not once .
you ?
no , i never took a bullet , but ...
i pulled my gun once .
shot it once .
really ?
it was my first one of these .
we were a secondary unit .
i was shaky going in .
i was a rookie .
we bust open a door , looking for this junkie , and he opened fire on us .
one cop got hit in the arm .
what was his name ?
it spun him like a top .
well , more like slow motion .
i remember riding in that ambulance ... and well ... he died right there .
right there .
what was his fucking name ?
swat goes before dicks .
they love this .
police !
clear !
good morning , sweetheart .
get up now motherfucker , now !
get up , you sack of shit !
fuck me !
dicks !
you' il want to look at this .
dicks !
jesus .
victor ?
what the hell ?
it' s just victor .
call an ambulance .
hearse , i' d say .
call for forensics .
get your people out .
no on touches anything .
it' s like a wax sculpture .
sloth .
aw , man .
goddamn .
the pictures were dated 3 days ago .
this must be the first .
look .
it' s dated one year ago today .
i got a hair sample .
i got a stool sample , piss , fingernails .
he' s laughing at us .
you got what you deserved .
he' s alive !
cocksucker' s alive !
guns down !
emergency on that ambulance !
he' s playing games .
no shit .
we have to divorce our emotions .
we must focus on details .
i feed off my emotions , how' s that ?
are you listening to me ?
yes , i can hear you .
excuse me .
what are you doing ?
closed crime scene .
out !
i got a right to be here .
i' m a upi photographer .
i got a right to be here .
get out !
jesus !
fucking jerk !
i got your picture , man .
i got your picture .
detective mills , m i l l s .
fuck off .
you can spell .
fuck you .
how do they get here so quick ?
the pay police for information .
they pay well .
hey , man , i' m sorry .
they piss me off .
okay .
it' s impressive to see a man feeding off his emotions .
one year of immobility , judging by ... muscle and spine deterioration .
blood tests show a smorgasbord of drugs in his system .
even an antibiotic , probably to prevent the bedsores from infecting .
has he tried to speak , or communicate in any way ?
even if his brain were not mush , which it is , he chewed off his tongue long ago .
doc ... is there no chance he might survive ?
he' d die of shock now if you shined a flashlight in his eyes .
he' s had as much pain and suffering as anyone , and he still has hell to look forward to .
good night .
hello , william .
it' s tracy .
tracy ?
everything okay ?
yeah .
yes , everything' s fine .
where' s david ?
in the other room , in the shower .
sorry to call you like this .
it' s all right .
what can i do for you ?
i need someone to talk to .
do you think you could meet me somewhere , maybe tomorrow morning ?
i don' t understand .
i feel stupid calling , but you' re the only person i know here .
there' s no on else .
if you can , give me a call , okay ?
i have to go now .
good night .
good night .
i mean ... you know this city so well .
you' ve been here ... so long .
it can be a hard place .
i don' t know why i asked you to come .
why don' t you talk to him ?
tell him how you feel .
i can' t be a burden .
especially now .
i' il get used to things , you know ?
i wanted to talk to someone who' s lived here a long time .
upstate , it' s a completely different environment .
did david tell you i teach 5th grade ?
i did .
he mentioned it .
i' ve been going around , looking at schools , but here the conditions here are horrible .
what about private schools ?
i don' t know .
tell me what' s really bothering you .
david and i are going to have a baby .
tracy , i ...
i don' t think i' m ... the one to talk to ... ... about this .
i hate this city .
i had a relationship once .
it was like a marriage .
we got pregnant .
this was a long time ago .
i remember getting up and going to work .
a day like any other , but the first day after i knew about the pregnancy .
and i felt this fear , for the first time ever .
how can i bring a child into a world like this ?
how can a person grow up with all this around them ?
i told her i didn' t want it .
over the next few weeks ,
i wore her down .
i want to have children .
i can tell you now that ...
i know , i mean ,
i' m positive that
i made the right decision .
but not a day passes that i don' t wish that i' d made a different choice .
if you don' t ... keep the baby ... if that' s your decision , don' t ever tell him you were pregnant .
but if you choose to have this baby , then spoil that kid , every chance you get .
that' s about ... all the advice
i can give you , tracy .
i got to go .
william ,
thank you .
victor' s landlord said there was cash in the mailbox , first of every month .
i never heard a single complaint from the tenant ... in apartment 306 , and nobody complained about him .
best tenant i' ve ever had .
a landlord' s dream .
a paralyzed tenant with no tongue .
who pays the rent on time .
i' m sick of this waiting .
this is the job .
why aren' t we out there ?
why sit here rotting , waiting till the lunatic does it again ?
lunatic " is dismissive .
don' t make that mistake .
come on .
he' s insane .
look .
right now he' s dancing in his grandma' s panties .
rubbing himself in peanut butter .
how' s that ?
i don' t think so .
his luck will run out .
he' s not depending on luck .
we walk in exactly one year after victor' s tied to the bed .
one year to the day .
he wanted us to .
don' t know that for sure .
oh , yes we do .
long is the way and hard that out of hell
leads up to light .
fuck him .
so what ?
he' s right so far .
imagine the will to keep a man bound for a year .
to sever his hand and to use it ... to plant fingerprints .
to insert tubes into his genitals .
the guy' s methodical , exacting and worst of all , patient .
he' s a nutbag .
because he' s got a library card doesn' t make him yoda .
you got money ?
i got 50 bucks .
i propose a field trip .
come on .
we' il make a list .
at the top we put " purgatory " ,
canterbury tales " anything on the 7 deadly sins .
ask yourself .
wait .
what would he study to do things he' s done ?
what are his interests now ?
jack the ripper , for instance .
where are we going ?
library .
coupons !
free coupons !
discount coupons !
they must have had about 50 health violations during the last inspection .
sit across from me .
i don' t want people thinking we' re dating .
give me your money .
i' il give you this , but i must know what we' re doing .
somerset .
how you doing ?
didn' t expect a mnage trois .
it' s not a problem .
sit down .
only for you do i do this .
it' s a big risk .
we' re just fair and square .
it' s a deal .
about an hour .
yeah .
help yourself .
that was money well spent .
yeah .
alright .
telling you this , i' m trusting you more than i trust most people .
good , i' m about ready to punch you .
it' s probably nothing , but it' s no skin off our teeth .
the pizza parlor guy is a friend from the fbl .
who , stinky man ?
for years , the fbl' s been hooked into the library system .
keeping records .
assessing fines ?
no , monitoring reading habits .
certain books are flagged .
books on , say , nuclear weapons ,
mein kampf " .
anyone checks out a flagged book , his library records go to the fbl .
wait .
how is this legal ?
legal , illegal .
these terms don' t apply .
you can' t use the information directly .
it' s a guide .
sounds silly , but you can' t get a library card without an id card and current phone bill .
so they run a list .
precisely .
if you want to know who' s reading
purgatory " , " paradise lost " and " helter skelter " , the fbl' s computers will tell us .
it could give us a name .
of a college kid writing a term paper on 20th century crime .
at least you' re out of the office .
get a haircut .
how do you know this ?
i don' t .
neither do you .
exactly .
divine comedy " ,
history of catholicism " , one called " murderers and madmen " .
modern homicide investigation " , " in cold blood " .
of human bondage " .
bondage ?
it' s not what you think .
marquis de sha day .
marquis de sade .
whatever .
writings of saint thomas aqua something .
saint thomas aquinas .
there .
he wrote about the 7 deadly sins .
is that it ?
yep .
let' s try it .
jonathan doe ?
whatever .
we' re sure about that name ?
you were , you saw it .
john doe .
you want to go back , i' il go back .

you can' t go in .
we need a warrant .
we got probable cause .

i can' t tell about the fbl .
get out of the way .
we have no reason to be here .
listen to me .
get the fuck off me .
alright .
i' m sorry .
just pay attention a minute .
with a hole like this , we won' t be able to prosecute .
the guy will walk .
that' s what you want ?
by the time we clear a warrant ...
fuck that !
we need a reason to knock on this door .
think about it .
okay ?
okay .
you' re right .
i' m all fucked up .
when you' re right , you' re right .
well ... no point in arguing anymore .
unless you can fix that .
you stupid son of a ...
how much money we got left ?
so , i noticed this guy going out a lot , when the murders was happening , so i ...
so you called detective somerset ?
right .
she called somerset .
' cause this guy ... was creepy and shit and one of the murders ... happened over there .
i told you the rest .
got everything ?
i got your story .

you gotta sign .
good .
you did good .
i did what you said .
here .
you get something to eat .
everybody stay outside .
victor .

somerset .
what ?
we had him .
what are you saying ?
fucking photographer ... on the stairs .
we had him and we let him go .
you sure this is him ?
yep .
good .
get it out .
we' ve got nothing to go on .
no pay stubs , appointment books .
just this receipt .
keep looking .
wait , look at this .
this was under the bed .
his only source of funds ?
we got his money .
i like it .
you won' t believe this .
we haven' t found a fingerprint .
not one .
right .
i don' t believe you .
keep looking .
we could us some more men .
i' m doing my best .
what are you getting ?
there are 2, 000 notebooks here .
each one has about 250 pages .
what about the killings ?
we' re sick , ridiculous puppets .
what gross stage we dance on .
what fun , dancing and fucking .
not a care in the world .
not knowing that we' re nothing .
we are not what was intended .
wait , there' s a lot more .
on the subway today , a man started a conversation .
small talk , a lonely man talking about the weather and things .
i tried to be pleasant , but my head began to hurt from his banality .
i almost didn' t notice , but i suddenly threw up all over him .
he was not pleased , and i couldn' t stop laughing .
no dates .
placed on the shelves in no discernable order .
his mind poured out on paper .
looks like a life' s work .
with 50 men , reading 24 hour shifts , ... it' d take 2 months .
i know .
phone ?
phone ?
people , quiet !
i admire you .
i don' t know how you found me .
imagine my surprise .
i respect you officers more every day .
i appreciate that , john .
i tell you ...
no , listen .
i' m readjusting my schedule in light of today' s setback .
i just had to call to express my admiration .
sorry i had to hurt ... one of you , but i had no choice , did i ?
accept my apology ?
i' d like to say more , but that' d ruin the surprise .
got it .
everybody back to work .
you were right .
he' s preaching .
these murders are his sermons to us .
look , we know him .
we know him .
who' s the blonde ?
looks like a ' pro ' .
maybe .
she caught john doe' s eye .
he collected it last night .
last night ?
yeah .
this man ?
yeah , john doe .
easy name to remember .
had a limp .
and the job you did for him ?
i' ve got a picture .
one sweet piece , actually .
i thought he was a performance artist .
the sort of guy that pisses in a cup on stage and then drinks it .
performance art .
right .
i think i undercharged him .
you made this for him ?
yeah , i' ve made ... weirder shit than that .
they found the blonde .
the picture !
the picture !
fucking pigs !
i need you to move .
i' il come out , but you guys ...
get out of the booth !
i' ve been in this cage the whole time .
come on , this way .
can you stop this music ?
we' re looking for the guy .
you from homicide ?
you better ... see this .
get this thing off me !
god , get it off me !
get him out of here , now !
i want to hear it again .
tell me again .
you heard nothing strange , saw nothing strange .
no .
no ?
he ask me if i was married .
i saw a gun in his hand .
where was the girl ?
the what ?
the prostitute .
where was she ?
someone comes to your establishment ... they want to go downstairs , get some ooh la la .
whatever .
they got to come to you .
yeah .
you didn' t see anyone ?
with a package ?
a knapsack ?
something under their arm ?
everybody comes in with a package under their arm .
some guys carry suitcases full of stuff .
she was just sitting on the bed .
who tied her down ?
you or him ?
do you like what you do ?
these things you see ?
no .
no , i don' t .
but that' s life , isn' t it ?
he had a gun .
and he made it happen .
he made me do it .
he put me that thing on me .
he made me wear it .
then he ... told me to fuck her .
and i did .
i fucked her .
oh , god !
oh , god !
he had a gun in my mouth .
the fucking gun was in my throat .
fuck .
oh , god .
god .
god , help me .
please , help me .
this won' t have a happy ending .
it' s not possible .
we catch him , i' il be happy .
if we catch john doe and he' s the devil , if he' s satan himself , that might meet our expectations .
but he' s not the devil .
he' s just a man .
you know ?
you bitch and you complain and you tell me these things .
if you think you' re preparing me for hard times , thanks but ...
but you got to be a hero .
you want to be a champion .
people don' t want a champion .
they want cheeseburgers ...
play lotto and watch tv .
how did you get like this ?
i want to know .
it wasn' t one thing , i' il tell you that .
go on .
i don' t think i can continue to live in a place ... that embraces , nurtures apathy as if it was a virtue .
you aren' t different or better .
i didn' t say i was .
i' m not .
hell , i sympathize .
i sympathize completely .
apathy is a solution .
it' s easier to lose yourself in drugs ... than it is to cope with life .
it' s easier to steal what you want than earn it .
it' s easier ... to beat a child than to raise it .
love costs .
it takes work .
we' re talking about mentally ill people .
we' re talking about crazies .
no , we' re not .
yes .
today .
no , we' re talking about everyday life here .
you can' t afford to be this naive .
fuck off .
you should listen to yourself .
yeah .
you say that ... the problem is people don' t care .
so , i don' t care about people .
nonsense .
you know why ?
you care ?
want to know ?
damn right .
you' il make a difference .
whatever .
the point is that ... you' re not quitting because you believe ... these things you say .
you want to believe them ... because you' re quitting .
and you want me to agree with you and say ,
you' re right , it' s a fucking mess .
we should all go live in a fucking log cabin .
but i won' t .
i won' t say that .
i don' t agree with you .
i do not .
i can' t .
i' m going home .
thank you , though .
i love you .
so much .
i know .
911 , what' s your emergency ?
could you repeat that ?
i' ve done it again .
what have we got ?
sleeping pills .
glued to one hand .
telephoned glued to the other .
you see what he did ?
he sliced her up .
then he bandaged her .
call for help and you' il live .
but you' il be disfigured .
or put yourself out of your own misery .
come on .
he cut off her nose .
to spite her face .
he did it very recently .
listen ,
i' ve decided to stay on till this is done .
one of two things will happen .
we' il get john doe , or he' il kill 7 and this case will never end .
don' t do me any favors .
thanks , but i got it .
i' m asking to be your partner a few days more .
you' d be doing me a favor .
you knew i' d say yes .
we' re here !
your wife called .
get an answer machine .
detective ?
after this , i' m gone .
no big surprise .
detective !
you' re looking for me .
don' t fucking move .
on the floor !
stay back !
on the fucking floor !
i know you .
now , get down !
get down on your stomach .
you piece of shit .
now !
all the way !
all the way , fucker !
down !
faster .
faster , fucker .
now .
nose on the ground .
jesus christ .
what the fuck is this ?
i' d like to speak to my lawyer , please .
godamnit !
he cuts the skin off his fingertips .
that' s why ... we found no prints in his apartment .
he' s been doing it for a while .
the bank accounts ?
the guns ?
so far it' s a dead end .
no credit history , no employment records .
a 5 year old bank account opened with cash .
we tried tracing his furniture .
all we know about him ... is he' s independently wealthy , well educated , and totally insane .
because he' s john doe by choice .
when can we question him ?
you don' t .
he goes to court now .
no way he' d turn himself in .
it makes no sense .
there he sits .
it' s not supposed to make any sense .
he' s not finished .
he' s pissing in our faces and we' re taking it .
you know what i' m saying .
for the first time , you and i are in agreement .
he wouldn' t just stop .
so what the fuck , man ?
he' s two murders away from completing his masterpiece .
we' il wait for his plea .
my client says there are two more bodies hidden away .
he will only take detectives mills and somerset to these bodies , only at 6 o' clock today .
why us ?
he says he admires you .
part of the game .
if they don' t accept the offer , the bodies won' t be found .
frankly , i' d let them rot .
we' ve got him .
downstairs , locked up .
he' il get ... free room and board , cable tv .
my wife doesn' t even have cable !
something stinks .
and this one , you , in your $3 . 000 suit , smug smile on your face , dealing for that piece of shit .
mills !
the law requires me to serve ... my clients ' interest as best i can .
we don' t make deals here , mr. swarr .
my client informs you that if you don' t accept , he' il plead insanity .
let him try it .
i' d like to see it .
with the extreme nature of these crimes , i' d get him off with such a plea .
i won' t let this conviction slide .
if you accept his conditions , he' il sign a confession , plead guilty right now .
it' s your case .
make a decision .
full confession .
i' m in .
has to be both of you .
if he claims insanity , this conversation is inadmissible .
blackmailing with his plea .
my client wants to remind you , two more are dead .
the press' d love to find out the police weren' t concerned about finding and burying them .
if there are two more dead .
the lab report came .
they did a quickie on doe' s clothes and fingernails .
they found blood from doe' s fingers , blood from the woman whose face he cut off , and a third party , as yet unidentified .
you' d be escorting an unarmed man .
let' s finish it .
if john doe' s head splits open and a ufo flies out ,
i want you to expect it .
i will .
if i accidentally shave off a nipple , would it be covered by worker' s comp ?
i suppose so .
if you were man enough to file a claim ,
i' d buy you one myself .
i keep coming home late , my wife' il think something' s up .
you know ... ?
yeah .
what ?
will this wind hurt us ?
who are you , john ?
who are you really ?
what do you mean ?
at this stage , there' s no harm telling us about yourself ?
doesn' t matter who i am .
it means absolutely nothing .
stay on your left up here .
where are we heading ?
you' il see .
we' re not just picking up two more bodies , are we ?
that wouldn' t be shocking enough .
you' ve got the papers to think about , yeah ?
wanting people to listen , you can' t just ... tap them on the shoulder anymore .
you have to use a sledgehammer .
then you' il get their strict attention .
why are you so special that people should listen ?
i' m not special .
i' ve never been exceptional .
this is , though .
what i' m doing .
my work .
your work , john ?
yes .
i don' t see anything special about it , john .
that' s not true .
no , it is .
funny thing is , after all this work , in 2 months no one' il care , give a shit , or remember .
you can' t see the complete act yet .
but when this is done , when it' s finished , it' s going to be ...
people will barely be able to comprehend .
but they won' t be able to deny .
could the freak be more vague ?
as far as master plans go ...
i can' t wait for you to see .
it' s going to be something .
know what ?
i' il be standing next to you .
so when this thing happens , be sure and let me know .
i don' t want to miss it .
don' t worry .
you won' t .
you won' t miss a thing .
what' s so exciting ?
it' s not too far now .
i tried to figure out something .
maybe you can help me ?
when a person is insane , as you clearly are , do you know you' re insane ?
wow , it' s amazing how fucking crazy i really am " ?
yeah ?
you guys do that ?
it' s more comfortable for you to label me insane .
it' s very comfortable .
it' s not something i' d expect you to accept .
but i did not choose .
i was chosen .
whatever .
i don' t doubt that you believe that .
but it seems that you' re ... overlooking a contradiction .
meaning what ?
glad you asked .
if you were chosen , by a higher power , if your hand was forced , it seems strange you' d get such enjoyment .
you enjoyed torturing those people .
that doesn' t seem to fit with martyrdom , does it ?
john ?
i doubt i enjoyed it any more than mills would enjoy time with me in a room without windows .
isn' t that true ?
how' d you like to ...
hurt me with impunity ?
that hurts my feelings .
i would never .
only because there' s consequences .
it' s in your eyes , though .
nothing wrong with a man talking pleasure in his work .
i won' t deny my own personal desire ... to turn each sin against the sinner .
wait , i thought all you did was kill innocent people .
innocent ?
is that supposed to be funny ?
an obese man .
a disgusting man who could barely stand , who you' d point out so your friends would join you mocking him .
if you saw him while you ate , you couldn' t finish your meal .
then the lawyer .
you had to secretly thank me for that .
a man dedicated to making money by lying with every breath he could muster to keep murderers and rapists ... ... on the streets .
murderers ?
murderers , like yourself .
a woman so ugly inside , she couldn' t go on living if she wasn' t beautiful outside ?
a drug dealer .
a pederast , actually .
let' s not forget the disease spreading whore .
only in a world this shitty ... could you say they were innocent and keep a straight face .
but that' s the point .
we see a deadly sin on every street corner , in every home , and we tolerate it .
we tolerate it because it' s common .
it' s trivial .
we tolerate it morning , noon and night .
well , not anymore .
i' m setting the example .
and what i' ve done will be puzzled over and studied and followed ... forever .
yeah .
delusions of grandeur .
you should be thanking me .
why' s that , john ?
because you' il be remembered after this .
realize , the only reason that i' m here now ... is that i wanted to be .
no , we would have got you .
really ?
were you biding your time ?
toying with me ?
allowing 5 " innocent " people to die ... until you sprang your trap ?
what was the evidence ... you were going to use on me ... right before i walked up and put my hands in the air ?
john .
calm down .
i remember us knocking on your door .
that' s right .
and i remember breaking your face .
you' re alive because i didn' t kill you .
okay , sit back .
i spared you .
sit back .
remember that when you look in the mirror ... for the rest of your life .
or i should say the rest of the life ...
i allow you to have .
sit back , you fucking freak !
shut your fucking mouth .
you' re no messiah .
you' re a t shirt , at best .
don' t ask me to pity those people .
i mourn them as much as the thousands at sodom and gomorrah .
you' re saying you were doing god' s good work ?
the lord works in mysterious ways .
see those high tension towers ?
that' s where we' re headed .
i see it .
9 o' clock , and follow that road .
there sure as shit ain' t no ambush out here .
no fucking nothing out here .
they' il come behind us in about two minutes .
i want you to go way up .
in 30 seconds , bank east on my mark .
i' il get him out .
get out .
slowly .
stop .
stay .
what do you got ?
a dead dog .
i didn' t do that .
what time is it ?
why ?
i' d like to know .
7 : 01 .
it' s close .
let' s go take a look .
it' s this way .
down .
down .
down .
watch him .
there he goes .
it' s good we have some time to talk .
the guy in red .
keep the crosshairs on him .
a van' s coming down the road .
from the north .
be ready for anything .
wait for my signal .
get out !
out !
jesus christ , man .
don' t shoot .
step away .
turn around .
hands on your head .
what' s going on ?
why are you here ?
i' m delivering a package to this guy , david .
detective ...
david mills .
get it .
slowly .
a guy paid me $500 to bring it .
he wanted it here at exactly 7 o' clock .
put it down .
we got a box .
we got a box .
call the bomb squad .
bomb squad , we got a box .
face the van .
hands up .
turn around .
okay , go .
off you go .
go .
i sent the driver out on foot .
he' s headed north .
have him picked up .
i don' t know .
i' m going to open it .
when i said i admired you , i meant what i said .
it' s blood .
you' ve made yourself quite a life .
you should be very proud .
shut up , you piece of shit .
california , stay away .
stay away .
don' t come in here .
whatever you hear , stay away .
john doe has the upper hand .
mills !
here he comes .
throw your gun down .
what ?
i wish i could' ve lived like you .
shut up .
what are you saying ?
do you hear me , detective ?
i' m trying to tell you ... how i admire you and your pretty wife .
what ?
tracy .
what did you fucking say ?
it' s disturbing ... how easily a member of the press can get ... information from your precinct .
what the fuck ?
throw your gun down !
i visited your home this morning , after you left .
i tried to play husband .
i tried to taste the life of a simple man .
throw it away !
it didn' t work out .
so ...
i took a souvenir .
her pretty head .
what' s he talking about ?
give me your gun .
what' s going on ?
put the gun down .
what was in the box ?
i envy your normal life .
drop the gun .
it seems envy is my sin .
what' s in the box ?
give me the gun .
what' s in the fucking box ?
he just told you .
you lie !
you' re a fucking liar !
shut up !
that' s what he wants .
he wants you to shoot him .
say it' s not true .
that' s not true .
become vengeance .
she' s all right .
become ... wrath .
she' s okay .
if you murder a suspect , you throw it all away .
he knows that .
she begged for her life .
shut up .
she begged for her life , and for the baby inside her .
he didn' t know .
give me the gun , david .
if you kill him , he will win .
oh , god !
oh , god !
we' il take care of him .
whatever he needs .
where are you going to be ?
around .
i' il be around .
the world is a fine place , and worth fighting for " .
i agree about the second part .
