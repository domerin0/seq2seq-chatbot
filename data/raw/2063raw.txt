tle me up , tle me down !
when you' re finished , see the director .
sure .
come in .
hi .
you wanted to see me ?
yes .
sit down .
the judge sees no reason for you to remain here .
he says you may re enter society as of today .
great !
no need to run away again .
you' re free , ricky .
being free also means being alone .
i won' t be able to protect you anymore .
like any other citizen , you will be responsible for your own actions .
don' t worry .
i' il manage .
what are your plans ?
find work and raise a family .
like normal people do .
you' re not a normal person .
the judge says i am .
what does he know !
there' s 50, 000 pesetas there .
it' s for the drawings , and the moments of pleasure and ecstasy you gave me .
thanks .
i promise not to spend it .
don' t be silly .
you' il need money until you find a job .
i' ve listed some places where you can apply .
now go , and don' t ever come back .
i told you to leave .
first , let me thank you for everything .
you' re running away , huh ?
this time the judge released me .
i' m allowed to join society .
society ! once i belonged to society , too .
it was a gourmet society .
but one day , they poisoned me .
i wouldn' t trust them if i were you .
come here .
take this .
it' s free .
what is it ?
the membership card for the society .
cards come in handy .
do you have any credit cards ?
no .
i' m fresh out .
i' m expecting a delivery .
great .
see you later .
how much is the nougat ?
600 pelas , kid .
mom , what are pelas ?
pesetas , darling .
hi .
hi .
i' il be right with you .
here' s your change .
goodbye .
what would you like ?
the heart in the window .
how much is it ?
500 .
my bus !
shouldn' t i wrap it ?
barajas studios .
therapeutic filming .
marina osorio .
marina !
i' il take my panties off .
they show .
what' s worse , showing your panties or showing your pussy ?
which reminds me , we' re supposed to do a number at the party tonight .
i promised .
like what ?
something sexy but simple , from our old act .
i don' t know if i can remember them .
sure you can .
show them a bit of flesh , and we can kill two birds with a stone .
maximo will be thrilled .
so will the producer . ok .
whatever you say , boss .
marina , i didn' t say anything before , but i' m so proud of you .
don' t be silly .
keep it up , huh ?
you put a lot of make up on .
i have to put something on .
i' il have to keep after them so we ...
hey , we could sing that one .
here' s something for you , too .
cool !
after my stroke , half of my body was paralyzed .
so i thought , if i wanted to make another film ,
i' d better hurry before the other half went . of course .
so here i am , doing my posthumous work .
don' t say that .
you look so alive in your electric chair .
i like that idea an electric chair .
i just meant ...
no , you' re right .
since i' ve been condemned to this chair ,
i feel hornier than ever .
my wife says i' ve regressed into childhood .
she may be right .
after a stroke , you have to learn to everything over again .
how to speak , how to read and write , how to dance .
but above all , you learn that you want to keep on living .
which , in my case , means making movies .
that was beautiful .
the knives .
that' s the fake one .
even she' s not fooled .
i was !
you weren' t .
fix that one .
it looks phoney .
about the couch ...
later .
later when ?
later !
have you seen marina ?
no .
how would you classify your film midnight phantom ?
a second rate horror film .
are you worried about making your comeback with a second rate film ?
i' ve always wanted to do one .
marina !
but i' m afraid it' s turning out to be quite personal .
a personal second rate film .
how does that work ?
when you put your heart and genitals into something , it always becomes personal .
you' re known as an actress ' director .
so genitals remind you of actresses ?
no .
i just wondered why , with so many actresses , you chose a porn actress who' s a junkie ?
if you want to leave here alive , don' t mention the words " porn " or " junkie " again .
hi , maximo .
hi .
so , when do we start ?
let' s see if they' ve finished your room .
how' s your toothache ?
hurts a bit .
haven' t they brought you an aspirin yet ?
carlos !
careful !
you' il wreck the set .
go around it .
jump .
be careful , you' re on the heavy side .
thanks .
you' re welcome .
i promise not to mention " porno " or " junkie " again .
good .
that' s better .
who' s she ?
a journalist .
what' s the next scene ?
my death .
how will you play that ?
good question .
maximo , when i' m stabbed , how should i play it ?
osvaldo .
look at her .
just like her .
osvaldo .
without saying " osvaldo " !
osvaldo .
don' t say osvaldo .
like that ?
she' s pissed .
maximo , what scene do we shoot ?
the telephone one .
it' s worse than a circus
how can you concentrate ?
when i was a kid , i worked in a real circus .
i trained horses , rodeo style .
i' d enter the ring with a lasso .
some supposedly wild horses would come out .
i' d round them up and tame them ...
are you listening ?
yeah , i' m listening .
what did i say ?
you rounded them up , tamed them and rode them .
when i had them all tamed , i' d line them up and , while they trotted ,
i' d jump from one to the other , striking poses and ...
tell me about it , dear .
i ran around in a short little tasseled skirt , and a ponytail that came down to my ass .
if only i' d been there .
osvaldo .
don' t you recognize me ?
i' m montse .
montse ?
you' ve changed !
since we split up , i' ve gained some weight .
you' re a bit heftier , too .
yeah .
mind if i interview you ?
so you' re a journalist now ?
and you' re an actor ?
kids , i have to talk to you .
ok , what' s next ?
wait a minute .
maximo , i have to talk to you .
excuse me .
watch my boots !
the producer' s wife likes the couch and wants it after the shoot .
so ?
in the final scene , it might get bloodstained and slashed .
some drops of blood will spill .
you can' t stab a girl without spilling blood .
i told him that .
you talk to him .
he doesn' t want any blood ?
he wants lots of it .
but not on the couch .
i' il change it .
you' il change nothing .
i never liked it .
you adore the ending !
i want to change it .
you have script changes ?
right away .
i just want you to make your movie .
just cos the producer' s wife has the hots for the couch , you shouldn' t compromise .
it' s no compromise .
i have a much better ending .
marina , you won' t die .
i' il save you .
i' m not gonna get stabbed ?
no .
too bad .
i got used to the idea .
now what ?
can you stand the toothache a bit longer ?
no .
why ?
because the expression it gives you is perfect for the scene .
well , since it' s there ...
thanks , sweetheart .
that man will be the end of my career .
he' s the nicest director i ever had .
unfortunately , he' d like to be even nicer .
you knew that , but you still took off your panties .
so what ?
so plenty !
looking at you inspires him .
he saves you , and changes everything on me .
yes ?
oh , it' s you .
no , i feel much better now .
yes , thank the police for me .
not today !
i' il see them tomorrow .
i' d rather sleep tonight .
darling , we' ve got our whole future ahead of us . of course i adore you .
tomorrow you can fill me in on the gory details , ok ?
i do !
i adore you .
goodbye , darling .
goodbye .
come out from there .
i knew you' d come .
you were waiting for me , even though they told you i had died .
i knew you wouldn' t die without saying goodbye to me .
i' m not here to say goodbye to you .
i' m here to take you away with me .
where to ?
to a quiet place , where we can be happy .
no .
first , take off your mask , and show me your face .
i don' t have a face .
you must have something .
if you' re taking me away with you , i might as well get used to it .
you really want to see it ?
yes .
i can' t .
look at my body .
it' s full of life .
but my face ... is the face of a corpse .
you can only offer me death , and death rarely brings happiness .
cut !
that' s a wrap .
help the actress .
stop .
nobody leave .
someone stole my walkman . osvaldo is missing 10, 000 pesetas .
and the handcuffs .
some props are missing .
i' m also missing 10, 000 pesetas .
i took yours .
i' il give it right back .
return everything and there' il be no repercussions .
i' m responsible for all this stuff .
i' d also like to take things , but i don' t .
you were wonderful , marina .
who was it ?
relax , lola .
you won' t lose your job .
the movie' s done .
you' re right .
let' s celebrate .
who was it ?
let' s have some champagne .
yes !
alcohol might loosen some tongues .
don' t stare at me like that .
i' m not staring .
i' m admiring .
well , don' t admire me like that .
what' s the hurry ?
i' m soaked .
what do you want ?
nothing .
you wouldn' t like it .
then don' t tell me .
will i see you at the party ?
sure .
hi .
sorry .
can i talk to you for a second ?
sorry , not now .
some other time .
marina !
look , marina !
look !
i' m not eating them .
lola , do you have my spare keys ?
sure .
you locked yourself out again ?
i don' t know .
i can' t find mine .
jeez , get your act together .
see you .
bye
you really should come to the party tonight .
i can' t .
and i don' t want to .
now let' s close the subject .
yes ?
my pay .
where' s the car ?
over there .
i' il bring it over .
what' s its name ?
paquita .
that' s my niece' s name .
show me your hoof .
poor thing .
she' s got a corn .
what' s that ?
a bruise on her heel .
you' d better unshoe her .
who' il pull the cart ?
if you don' t , gangrene will set in .
make a bran and vinegar poultice .
stick it in some sacking and wrap her hoof in it .
after 24 hours , take it off and clean it with iodine .
when it dries , she' s cured .
paquita , tell them not to abuse you .
i mean it .
she could die .
thank you , miss .
bye , paquita .
the young lady' s right .
hazlenut chocolates .
it' s from maximo .
it' s pepe , your neighbor .
hi .
where are you off to ?
on vacation .
see if i can forget that nightmare of a movie .
if any important mail comes , give it to lola .
she has my address .
marina , i don' t know how you did it , but you were marvelous .
really ?
you bet !
i just did what maximo told me to do , even if i didn' t understand .
when i get back , you can explain your secret to me .
when are you due back ?
in two or three weeks . ok .
have a good time .
and i hope you get laid .
if i do , i won' t come back .
you have a one track mind !
what is it , pepe ?
what' s up ?
relax .
what' s going on ?
don' t scream .
i said , don' t scream !
i warned her .
hi .
who are you ?
the guy that attacked you .
does it hurt ?
damn .
get out or i' il call the cops .
i had to hit you to stop you screaming , but i didn' t mean to hurt you .
i told you to get out .
god , this looks like a drugstore .
you bastard .
you broke my tooth .
i said i was sorry .
sure .
you want to fuck me , right ?
then get it over with .
relax .
we' il fuck when the time is right .
so what do you want ?
i' il tell you .
let' s go to bed .
we' il be more comfortable .
watch out for the glass .
i tried speaking to you , but you wouldn' t let me .
so i had to kidnap you so you could get to know me .
i' m sure you' il fall in love with me , just like i' m in love with you .
i' m 23 , and i have 50, 000 pesetas .
i' m alone in the world .
i' il try to be a good husband to you and a good father to your children .
you' re the thief .
i tried to talk to you but you ignored me .
you' re the one who did the handstand .
sometimes i show off .
that' s why you look familiar .
we' ve met before .
last year , at a bar called lulu .
don' t you remember ?
i' d just run away from the hospital .
we met at lulu' s .
we went to your place and fucked .
remember ?
i promised to come back and protect you .
many men have promised me that .
but i' m here to prove it .
and stop throwing things .
did you like the heart ?
nice touch , eh ?
she' s a sweetheart .
i don' t get it .
you' ve taken four pills .
regular painkillers don' t work for me .
why not ?
i was hooked on smack .
when you' re used to heroin , painkillers don' t do shit .
god , i didn' t know . only something like morphine would help .
morphine ?
where would i find that ?
the doctor who detoxed me might prescribe something .
we can' t go to a doctor !
what would you say ?
meet a pal who just kidnapped me " ?
no .
so what would you say ?
nothing .
i swear .
and she lives three blocks from here .
please !
i can' t stand it anymore .
and besides , this is your fault .
all right .
but if you try to trick me ,
i swear i' il do us both in !
go on , get dressed .
you' ve got a great body .
don' t look for blades or scissors .
i hid them .
put some make up on your bumps and bruises .
i like being in the bathroom with you .
it' s like a married couple getting ready to go out .
marina , it' s lola .
pick up the phone .
you' ve gone too far .
i had to sing alone .
we' il hold hands and hide the handcuffs .
everyone asked where you were ...
who' s that ?
my sister .
what does she want ?
i don' t know .
wait .
if you' ve done something silly , don' t worry .
you were doing so well .
see you tomorrow , darling .
give me a drink .
what' il you have ?
a beer .
i may not like your face , but you have a great ass .
max , please !
give me a drink .
you' ve had enough .
forgive him , lola .
i drink plenty too , but i don' t bug him about his stroke .
your ass and my stroke are part and parcel of our culture .
that' s true .
you were great , lola .
thanks .
we' d have liked to hear marina .
why isn' t she here yet ?
i just spoke to her .
the rain in the last scene made her toothache worse .
he told me the last scene was great .
great .
imagine hanging like a man called horse for four hours in the rain .
lola , forgive my frankness it' s the alcohol .
i forgive you .
although you' ve got an ugly face , you have a great pair of tits .
it' s true .
we shouldn' t have come .
don' t say that now .
she may have company .
she lives alone .
she might have a visitor !
come on , i' il ask her .
who is it ?
berta , it' s marina .
come on in .
are you alone ?
very much alone .
come on up .
all right .
how dare you ?
marina , don' t try anything .
what is it ?
you scared me .
i have an awful toothache .
yeah .
it' s horribly swollen .
i' m glad that' s all it is .
hi , i' m berta .
please to meet you .
ricky .
come on in .
i' ve already taken four fiorinals .
they didn' t work .
i told you before , the first few months ...
careful !
the table has a mind of its own .
in the first few months , painkillers won' t help after everything you' ve taken .
give me something strong .
i' il prescribe ...
sosegon .
there' s nothing worse than toothache .
or an earache or colic .
i never had colic .
i have .
marina , take this for two or three days .
no longer .
you can get hooked on this , too .
and i know you .
you' re such a hog .
isn' t she ?
did she hit you ?
no .
i bumped into something .
you' re quite a pair .
would you like a joint ?
no , thanks .
no , thanks .
marina , you look uptight .
calm down .
why are you so agitated ?
i can' t stand it .
give me something now .
a shot ?
yes .
i' il give you a dolantin .
girl , you' re a born dope fiend .
the babies have woken up .
i' il go rock them .
don' t .
why ?
don' t bother .
i' il go .
you don' t mind , ricky ?
i really like your guy .
you haven' t taken anything ?
you' re acting so weird .
let me see .
your pupils are enormous .
he kidnapped me .
call the cops .
the cops ?
why ?
my babies .
why did you pick them up ?
i couldn' t resist holding them .
look at them !
mama !
don' t worry .
the pain will be gone soon .
look , marina .
let' s go , ricky .
what are you looking for ?
i' m here .
don' t fuck around now .
don' t hold my hand .
the handcuffs will show .
the street is empty .
how come ?
it' s a holiday weekend and it' s august .
your pain' s gone , right ?
i can tell by your face .
shall we get the medicine ?
yes .
then give me your hand .
and shut up !
someone' s ringing .
let them .
i can hear moaning .
it might be an emergency .
probably a junkie .
goddamn bastards .
be careful .
say no to rheumatism .
ma' am .
what is it ?
we need some sosegon .
i haven' t got any .
lady , this isn' t a holdup .
just in case .
we have a legal prescription .
call the doctor to check .
i don' t have any .
anything else ?
yes , a roll of sticking plaster .
what for ?
be quiet .
you can get sosegon in chueca , in the square .
the drugstore' s open there ?
drugstore ?
buy it on the street . on the black market , you' il find all the pills you want .
wait , there' s no rush .
don' t push your luck .
what' s up ?
i don' t want to go inside .
what do you want ?
let me go .
that' s impossible .
marina , be sensible .
you want me to break another tooth ?
we' re going home .
come on .
come on .
now what ?
i' il take off the handcuffs and you can get comfortable .
what for ?
i' m going to get your pills .
lie down and wait for me .
turn around .
i don' t want you to see me naked .
sure .
sorry .
you wouldn' t have some rope , or something you hang washing from ?
why ?
this will do .
too short .
a rope .
anything .
what are you gonna do ?
you need anything ?
you want to write or chat ?
shall we play a game ?
fine .
call me if you need me .
sure .
years ago , when a bullfighter got top honors , his fans would carry him home .
then he' d go out onto the balcony to receive the final ovation .
i don' t know why i' m telling you this .
i guess it' s because i' m near the balcony and i wish i could see you coming down the street , coming to talk to me .
marina , it' s maximo .
marina !
i don' t know if your tooth hurts or what !
you don' t want to talk ?
fine .
but if you' re avoiding me , i' d like to know why .
marina !
ok .
call me tomorrow .
i' il either be in editing or at home .
so long .
my mustache will fall off .
you got any sosegon ?
no .
i got hash and scag .
the girl on the bike' s got pills .
thanks .
hey !
you on the bike !
got any sosegon ?
don' t yell , asshole .
take it easy .
i just asked if you had any .
how many ?
i don' t know ... a few .
my girlfriend' s got a toothache .
you got any cash ?

i have more .
wait here .
i' il be right back .
i said to wait .
now that i' m here ...
how many ?
gimme all you' ve got .
what' s going on ?
son of bitch .
what' s in here ?
what do you think ?
if i see you again , i' il kill you .
it' s me .
look what i brought you .
you' il like it .
she' s dead to the world .
all right .
i' il untie you so you won' t think i enjoy making you suffer .
she' il wake up .
she' il wake up .
no , she won' t .
careful not to touch her pussy .
don' t wake up .
the gag .
better leave it on .
she' s kinda mouthy .
well , let' s rest a little .
it' s been some night .
the nights i' ve dreamed of lying here with you .
christ .
what a hard on .
i' il jerk off .
sort of embarrassing with her here , though .
better just go to sleep .
yes .
what' s going on ?
the pain is back .
and you thought the keys might help , right ?
i took the stuff you brought me .
and that' s how you thank me ?
you dumb shit .
can' t you see i was testing you ?
it was a trap .
you think i' m an idiot ?
how long before you fall in love with me ?
when will you realize nobody' il love you like i do ?
poor thing .
it' s more of a love story than a horror story .
sometimes they' re indistinguishable .
we' ve got a hit , maximo .
what' s wrong , lola ?
nothing .
just a hangover .
have a bloody mary .
i might . order one for me , too .
ok .
i will .
one for me , too . ok .
anything else ?
i' m about to leave .
bring the mag tracks .
have marina call me .
why ?
i have to talk to her .
i' m going to her place now .
should i come with you ?
better not .
have her call me .
i miss her .
i' il tell her .
bye .
the washer' s rotted .
ok .
here' s breakfast .
what are you doing ?
wait a minute .
sorry .
i have to go to the bathroom .
when you have to go , just tell me .
and if you' re gagged , make a signal .
do you like my drawing ?
turn off the faucet .
i thought it would help .
listen to me .
what ?
i' il never fall in love you !
never !
don' t say that yet .
i' il never love you , you' re pathetic !
who asked you to care for me ?
who asked you to protect me ? or to be my husband or father to my kids ?
who ?
who asked for your 50, 000 pesetas ?
keep them .
spend them on someone else .
it hurts ?
yes .
i' m going out to buy some antibiotics , and a washer .
a washer ?
yeah , for the kitchen faucet .
i' il have to tie you up a little .
lie down , please .
please .
come on .
sit up , please .
i don' t like doing this .
so don' t .
shut up .
should i bring you anything ?
different tape .
this one skins me alive .
i' m very upset .
just think a little .
i know you' ve got problems , but put yourself in my shoes .
imagine how i feel about what you said in the bathroom .
after all i did for you .
i' ve been mistreated , but never that badly .
anyway .
if you could only ... think less about yourself , and think a little about others .
nobody has ever called me pathetic .
nobody !
i' il never fall in love with you !
never !
we' il see .
oh , great .
i' il deal with you later .
marina !
are you there ?
it' s lola .
marina , please !
paper tape .
non allergic tape .
silk tape to go with formalwear .
what do you want it for ?
for the face .
something easy to peel off .
this one with holes sells pretty well .
let' s see .
it' s for your scratch ?
no , it' s for a girl .
it' s very soft .
this one' s fine .
i' il take it .
anything else ?
yes .
antibiotics for a toothache .
an infection ?
marina , how can you disappear without a word ?
i' m worried to death .
if you don' t show up , i may have to call the cops , and we wouldn' t want that .
whatever you' ve done , there' s always some solution .
you' re what' s important .
call me , please .
don' t try to fix it by yourself .
if you need to go cold turkey , i' il be there for you .
but say something , darling .
lola .
i have a surprise for you .
i' il take the gag off later .
first , the surprise .
don' t worry .
it' s a nice surprise .
well ?
do you like the place ?
i' ve been here before .
careful , careful ...
that' s it .
aren' t you afraid someone will find us ?
that' s why we moved .
who' d look for us here ?
i' m not as ionely as you are .
i have my family , my work .
someone will miss me .
sooner or later , they' il look for me .
then we' d better leave soon .
your sister was just here .
i didn' t want to tell you , but i almost ran into her .
i know what .
call your sister and say you' ve left town with some friends .
then she won' t bother us , and it' il calm her down , too .
you' il let me call her ?
yes .
but just to calm her down .
one wrong word ...
i' il cut your throat , and then my own .
marina , i have nothing .
so i' ve nothing to lose .
don' t touch .
leave the pepper alone .
don' t mess with it .
give it to me .
careful with the ...
mom .
it' s me , marina .
marina , how are you ?
fine .
how are you ?
as always .
no , leave me alone !
what' s that ?
your niece wants to know who i' m talking to .
mom , i' m not in madrid .
tell lola .
i' il tell her .
i came to the country to rest , with friends .
good idea .
what' s for lunch ?
stop it !
what a brat .
i can' t wait until her mother takes her home .
lunch ?
ratatouille .
oh , ratatouille .
it' s delicious .
and i' il miss it .
don' t worry .
i' il put some in the fridge for when you' re back .
i have no phone , but i' il call you .
call whenever you want .
i want to hear from you .
don' t forget me .
i won' t forget you , mom .
mom ?
what ?
i love you a lot .
and i love you .
take care .
yes , i will .
big hug .
goodbye , mom .
why do retired germans spend their summers in benidorm , while the poor spanish pensioners have to beg at the subway entrances ?
because the german pensioners think about their future when they' re 18 , and the spaniards ...
the spaniards ...
the spaniards only think about their pensions when it' s already too late .

i didn' t want to wake you .
what are you doing ?
drawing a map of my life .
show me .
look .
imagine my life is a subway line .
first stop : orphaned at the age of three . orphanage .
escaped at the age of eight .
reform school , more escapes .
mental home at sixteen .
what a career !
at the hospital , i learned lots of trades .
locksmith is my favorite , breaking in , breaking out .
so i could escape occasionally , but i always came back .
why ?
i had nowhere to go .
and the director liked me .
so that' s why you screw so well .
with them , it was different .
the directors ?
no .
there was just one director .
the others were nurses .
now i understand .
continue .
last year , i escaped and met you .
that stop changed my life .
since then , i can only think of you .
since i spent my time thinking , i stopped acting crazy and became normal .
a judge came and tested me .
he said i was fine .
they released me .
end of the line .
marina .
you .
me .
i can' t leave her hanging there .
i need another scene .
or two .
find marina , please .
if it' s a question of money , i' il pay for it .
with what ?
it' s not only the money .
there' s a limit to everything .
perfection is my only limit .
maximo , must i remind you of your duty as the director ?
it' s my duty to warn you the film has no ending .
just add " the end " .
end of discussion .
you really are going too far .
we must talk .
come to the bar .
ok .
can you grab the mags ?
thanks .
what' s with your sister ?
why doesn' t she phone ?
who knows ?
i' il see what antonio wants .
sure , hurry .
or you won' t work on his next picture .
if you' re directing it , i' d rather be a policewoman !
that' s enough , maximo .
lola !
lola !
what' s he got against me ?
it' s not you .
he doesn' t want to finish the film because he knows it' s his last .
i know he' s unbearable ...
i' il say .
it' s his way of fighting death .
but ...
tell marina to call him at least once .
marina' s disappeared .
what ?
i haven' t seen her since the last day of shooting .
at the party you said you spoke with her .
i lied .
have you told the police ?
no .
see , the police and us ...
no , i didn' t .
do something .
set the table . ok .
look .

between plasencia and hervas .
tonight , i' il steal a car and we' il go .
what , with your face like that ?
so ?
i' ve got balls .
don' t you wanna go ?

so we' il go by train , or bus .
but we' il go .
the pain' s gone , hasn' t it ?
my whole body hurts .
we' il go tomorrow .
is that your doorbell ?

you knew !
that' s why you didn' t want to leave .
i didn' t know .

i' il burn it .
i can think of something better to burn .

what were you up to up there ?
i won' t say what i think .
we' il leave now .
we can' t wait .
whatever you say .
i' il try and steal a car .
i have a little money .
we' il need it .
we' il also need a car . ok .

the guy who kidnapped you ?
you' re crazy .
come on .
how can you fall in love with a kidnapper who ties you up ?

we' il go over the roof and out through the other building .
come on !
hurry .
quick , get in .
the line from granadilla to marina .
how do you feel ?
fine .
i brought you a sleeping pill .
thanks , lola .
all right .
now tell me all about it .
you don' t trust your sis ?
it' s not easy to explain .
then tell me how he kidnapped you ?
it was the night of the party .
i was at the door , saying goodbye to pepe .
the bell rang again and i opened the door .
i thought it was pepe .
you shouldn' t have opened the door .
but i did .
i screamed and ricky hit me .
that' s terrible .
he didn' t mean to hurt me , just to shut me up . oh , yeah .
right .
when i came to , he said that he had kidnapped me so that i could get to know him .
he said " i' m 23 and i have 50, 000 pesetas .
i' m alone in the world .
i' il be a good husband to you , and a good father to your kids .
what a mess .
