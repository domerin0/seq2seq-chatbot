when it comes to kids , i know self esteem is important .
but are we really doing them a favor with all this " touchy feely everyone wins a trophy even if they lost " stuff ?
and we' re so afraid to hurt their feelings that we can' t even discipline them anymore .
i am really disappointed in you .
now clean up that mass murder , go straight to your room , and think about what you' ve done .
and no dessert .
okay , maybe one cookie .
you' re busted .
oh , my god !
dad you scared me .
good .
now you know how i felt for the last hour and a half .
you didn' t call .
you didn' t answer your cell .
you could' ve been dead or worse .
what' s worse than dead ?
believe me , there' s worse .
so , uh , what' s your excuse this time ?
i went to see my friend keith' s band , and they didn' t go on until 10 : 00 .
and it just would' ve been rude if i left in the middle .
your friend keith' s band ?
who the hell is keith ?
he' s this guy that i really , really like , and it was really important for me to be there so i could get on his radar .
look , i don' t want you on his radar .
okay ?
i don' t want you on any of his equipment .
>from now on , during the week , you have to be home by 10 : 00 .
10 : 00 ? !
are you crazy ? !
and don' t talk back .
i can' t even ...
get to bed , you have school in the morning .
fine .
what the hell are you doing up ?
it' s after midnight .
i' m just chatting online with my friend in japan , shigetoshi takanowa .
what ?
he just got back from school .
look , we talked about this .
okay ?
if you stay up all night , you can' t get up in the morning , and you can' t afford to be late for school anymore .
okay , now go to bed .
but i didn' t get to ...
and don' t talk back .
whatever .
huh ?
what ?
i' m sleeping .
hillary was late again .
if you' re not talking about her period , i' m going back to sleep .
ah , she just doesn' t care , you know ?
it' s like talking to a brick wall that every guy in town wants to feel up .
and mike , he stays up all night talking to his friend , mitsubishi , then he can' t even wake up .
can this please wait until morning ?
fine .
it' s like they don' t even hear what i tell them .
or or they just don' t care .
and you know what ?
i' m tired of it .
you know , when i was a kid , i wouldn' t dare talk back to my dad .
you know why ?
' cause i was afraid of him .
but we' re so concerned with the kids liking us , now they see me as their best friend instead of the authority figure that i am .
um , dave ?
i' m pretty sure if you asked them , they wouldn' t consider you their best friend .
in fact , not even a " top five " friend .
i' m just so sick of them talking back with their fresh mouths .
what ?
you think i like that they talk back ?
no .
am i glad they feel comfortable enough to tell us how they really feel ?
no .
nah , nah , you know what the problem is ?
they have no fear .
okay ?
they' re not afraid of us .
they' re not afraid of their teachers .
they' re not even afraid of god .
that' s our fault .
we never took the to temple or to church .
hey , maybe that' s a good punishment make them sit through sunday mass .
you know what ?
i' m jewish , the jets are playing you take ' em .
hey , dad , i need you to sign this math test .
you failed ?
no my teacher just wants your autograph .
he' s a big fan of mid level insurance salesmen .
hey , this isn' t a joke .
how could you fail after all that money we spent on a tutor ?
it' s first period and i guess i might' ve missed some classes .
okay , then you can forget about the father son ski trip next month .
sweet .
i' ve been trying to think of a way to get out of that .
you see what i' m talking about ?
i i hope you didn' t go to school dressed like that .
of course not .
i wore my hair down .
is that a tattoo ?
a what ?
no , it' s just a henna .
it' il come off ... eventually .
i think .
it' s no big deal .
no big deal ?
it says " crack whore .
that' s keith' s band .
okay , you know what ?
you' re not seeing that guy again until i meet him .
and i' m guessing after i meet him you' re still not seeing him .
fine .
then i guess you don' t want me going to school because i see him there every day .
i could just drop out .
you know what ?
are you going to sign this test , or should i just forge it ?
do you not see me having ...
you know , you' re at work all day .
i can see who i want , when i want .
all right , all right , all right , that' s is it !
okay ?
okay ?
apparently , you kids have forgotten that we are the parents .
okay ?
so to remind you of this , we are instituting a " zero tolerance " policy , effective immediately .
if anybody misses their curfew , or doesn' t do their homework , or talks back , or just looks at us wrong , they are getting a spanking .
oh , my god .
are you serious ?
you think this is some kind of joke ?
do you ?
just try me and see what happens .
yeah .
yeah .
eh .
now who wants to mess with me first ?
yeah .
that' s right .
that' s what i thought .
remember , i' m the stallion .
okay ?
you' re nothing but ponies .
what the hell was that about ?
pretty good , huh ?
it just came out of me .
just put it back in .
you don' t understand .
see , i' m taking back control .
honey , in case you haven' t noticed , the kids are big , and they outnumber us .
i think the spanking ship has sailed .
has it ?
oh , my god , are you were serious ?
you' d actually spank them ?
no .
of course not .
oh , thank god .
but they don' t have to know that .
come on , sweetie , i supported your stupid swear jar idea .
what ?
we put a dollar in a jar .
we didn' t hit them over the head with it .
i' m not going to hit them .
it was just a threat .
see ?
this is just what we need .
i created a total climate of fear .
yeah , you' re sure as hell scaring me .
hey , guys .
hey , dad .
how' s that project going , larry ?
it' s good .
i' m making an rna molecule .
if i can get the covalent bonds between the nucleotides to ...
yeah , yeah .
knock yourself out .
are you actually studying on a saturday ?
yeah , just trying to catch up on some of this math .
guess what , dad ?
keith finally asked me out , but i told him that you had to meet him first .
all right .
good attitude .
bring him by later .
yeah .
order yours now and i' il show you how to threaten your way to a happy home .
call 516 507 2370 .
that' s 516 507 2370 .
now .
who the hell broke my putter and tried to superglue it back together ?
it wasn' t me .
i didn' t touch it .
me neither .
superglue .
interesting .
isn' t that interesting , larry ?
you want to tell me what happened ?
huh ?
okay .
kenny and i were playing gladiator , and i sort of used your putter as a sword .
but the good news is , i did vanquish the enemy and cast off the shackles of servitude .
a a are you nuts ?
do you have any idea how much this cost me ?
i am so pissed right now , i i don' t even know what to do .
hey , here' s an idea .
why don' t you spank him ?
what ?
that is the new policy , right ?
i mean , larry used something of yours without asking .
yeah , well ...
and he lied by telling you he didn' t break it , so technically , that should be two beatings .
that' s true .
dad , i' m really sorry ,
i' il buy you a new putter ... somehow .
you' re damn right you will .
whoa .
whoa , whoa , whoa .
dad .
you' re not going to hit him ?
i knew it !
i knew you would never hit us .
you' re all talk .
hey , hillary , maybe he' s just afraid that larry is such a fierce warrior , he' s going to vanquish him .
why are they doing this to me ?
i i don' t want to spank them .
i don' t want to spank anyone .
i i just want them to listen to me .
okay , larry , stand up .
you' re getting a spanking .
what ?
oh , come on !
i said get up right now .
but ...
but i said i was sorry , and i never do anything wrong !
you knew the rules when you broke them .
what ... what ...
dad , what are you doing ? !
stop it .
yeah .
all right , get ready , larry .
wait , wait !
i know ... what if i just use a big backswing , and a little follow through ?
it' il look painful , but it won' t really hurt , you know ?
like in pro wrestling .
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
i can' t believe you just hit me .
what the hell is wrong with you ? !
hi .
what happened ?
what happened ?
nothing happened .
what , do you think you leave the house and everything falls apart ?
nothing happened .
dad just beat the crap out of larry .
you beat the crap out of larry ?
no .
of course not ; don' t be ridiculous .
it was just a spanking .
hey , did you get those tofutti cuties i like ?
i cannot believe you hit our kids .
what is wrong with you ?
they called my bluff .
what was i supposed to do ?
oh , yeah , dave , that makes sense .
anytime anybody calls your bluff , you should just beat the crap out of them .
come on , it was just a tap .
i wouldn' t ever actually hurt him .
i barely even touched him .
sweetie , where are you going ?
dad beat me up , so i' m moving to kenny' s .
beat you up .
i' m not going to live in a house where i have to sleep with one eye open .
i barely even touched you .
it was nothing .
come on , tell her .
honey , honey , can' t ...
you .
what ?
he did what ?
he hit me .
three times , really hard !
okay , it didn' t really hurt , but it was humiliating .
he just thinks he can get away with this ' cause he thinks i' m a wuss .
well , i showed him .
i packed my bags and walked right out of there .
that is very unsettling .
so can i stay here with you guys for a while ?
you can stay as long as you want , right , mom ?
of course .
now , kenny , do your homework and your chores , then you can watch 15 minutes of tv .
thanks , mom .
15 minutes of tv ?
it' s not so bad .
so , which half of that ' 70s show do you want to watch ?
mr. gold ?
yeah ?
i' m eartha marshall .
i work at child services .
no , thanks , i already have three .
i' m told there' s been an incident .
and then he said he didn' t care if he even went on the father son ski trip .
and then hillary , she comes in with this henna tattoo .
and i had to do something to get back control .
why aren' t you writing that down ?
when you hit larry , was it open fist , closed fist , with a belt ?
it was with remorse .
there was no fist at all .
it was a love tap , really .
i just gave him a little swat on the butt .
that she writes down .
look , nothing happened .
this is totally being blown out of proportion .
so you witnessed the incident ?
no , no , i wasn' t around .
mother not around .
it' s you .
is larry here ?
maybe he is , maybe he isn' t .
just get him .
what do you want ?
i' m here for larry .
larry , quickly lock yourself in the bathroom !
i will call nine hundred and eleven .
what' s the matter with you ?
larry , come on , okay ?
let' s go home .
this is my home now .
oh , you' re being ridiculous , okay ?
i want you to come home , right now .
or what ?
you' il cut off his feet and put them up on sticks , huh ?
barbarian .
oh , i barely touched him .
and i know it was you who called child services , you whack job .
dad ?
okay , so you wanted to meet keith , here he is .
it' s a pleasure to meet you , mr. gold .
you' re keith ?
uh , yeah .
yeah ?
crack whore keith ?
uh , you know , actually we changed our name .
it turns out there was another band named crack whore , so now we' re calling ourselves the grateful dead .
isn' t he great ?
yeah , yeah .
you' re , uh ... you' re not all that i pictured .
your hair' s not that long .
you smell okay .
your pants aren' t hanging below your ass .
you know , sir , i understand why you' d have that impression , but that' s not me .
i' m a straight a student .
i' m going to princeton in the fall .
ah .
princeton , huh ?
yes .
and , hey , don' t worry , i' il treat hillary with the respect she deserves .
ah .
well , you better treat her better than that .
oh , i' m just teasing you , sweetie .
oh , it' s just a joke .
and , hey , i promise you , if her curfew is 10 : 00 ,
i' m gonna make sure she' s homeat 9 : 58 , all right ?
keith , will you marry my daughter and make me the happiest man on earth ?
what do you mean you' re coming home ?
you can' t ; it' il ruin everything .
but i hate it at kenny' s .
his parents make me do chores , and they don' t let me eat candy or drink soda .
i' d rather be hit .
larry , you can' t let dad win .
our futures depend on this .
actually ...
dad really isn' t that bad , especially compared to most of my friends ' fathers .
i mean , how horrible must we have been lately to make him hit us ?
me .
make him hit me .
maybe we should just cut dad some slack you know , not give him such a hard time .
do not go soft on me !
okay ?
larry getting his ass beat is the best thing that' s ever happened to us .
it' s not the best thing that' s ever happened to me .
this isn' t about you .
look , now that child services has a file on mom and dad , they' re totally powerless against us .
and if larry gets dad to apologize , he' il be a completely broken man .
we' il have total free rein .
but i want to come home .
i want soda .
i want to watch the o. c.
are you forgetting what dad did to you ?
are you going to be a wuss and let him get away with that ?
hey , don' t call me a wuss !
you' re right , i hate dad .
that' s right , you hate him , all right .
he ruined your life .
so go back there , stay there , and stay angry .
i will .
yeah , you will .
i mean , who decided all of a sudden that giving your kid a little swat on the behind was child abuse ?
it' s crazy .
tell me about it .
your father spanked you when you were a kid , right ?
many times .
and it didn' t " permanently damage " you , did it ?
not at all .
exactly .
and you' ve spanked your kids , haven' t you ?
but you did threaten to spank them , right ?
no , dave .
i love my kids .
i' d never hit them or threaten them with violence .
i did spank my wife once , though .
but in all fairness , that was her idea .
look , you didn' t deserve to get spanked .
you' re a good kid , and it won' t happen anymore , okay ?
so i want you to come home now .
i don' t think so .
come on , larry , i apologized , all right ?
i want to go home , and i want to go home right now .
why should i care ?
because i' m your father , and i said so .
not good enough .
larry , look , i' m going to count to three , okay ?
and if you don' t go inside and get your stuff ...
what , you' re gonna hit me ?
just do it , okay ?
one ... two ...
back off !
that' s it larry , you' re gonna do what i tell you to do , and you' re going to do it now .
get out of my face !
larry , i' m not playing around ...
what the ...
i' m bleeding ?
well , i apologized to larry .
hope you' re happy .
thank you .
okay , honey , i want you to come home now .
i i can' t .
he hates me now .
dad must get mad at you sometimes .
what do you do to make him forgive you ?
yeah , that' s not going to work for you , larry .
can' t you at least talk to him for me ?
well , this is something you' re going to have to do yourself .
i think this is one of those man to man things .
great , not only do i have to talk to him , i have to be a man , too ?
honey , you can' t stay here forever .
i don' t know about that .
that better be a can of goat milk .
all right , let' s go .
dad ?
yeah .
about before , um ...
well , i ...
i didn' t mean to ...
i didn' t know what to ...
forget it .
what ?
don' t worry about it , okay ?
we' re good .
really ?
yeah .
oh , okay .
dad ?
yeah .
thanks .
to be honest , i' m proud of him .
when he punched me , he became a man .
if you overlook the running away and squealing like a little girl part .
mom .
i thought you guys were going to the movies .
yeah , we were going to , but then your dad found out it was subtitled , and suddenly , he was too tired .
ah !
who' s this little angel ?
hey , hey , keith .
hey , who do we have here ?
who is this little oh , my goodness gracious .
look at this little baby .
you are so sweet .
yes , you are .
is this your little sister ?
she' s so cute .
oh , actually , she' s not my sister .
oh , really ?
she your little niece ?
no , um ...
you know , she' s actually ... uh , well , she' s kind of ... you know , my daughter .
he has a baby ?
did i not mention that ?
