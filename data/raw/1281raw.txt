god bless you , penis .
she' s going to be okay .
what a relief .
brian , would you excuse us ?
i want to talk to larry for a minute .
okay ?
you' il be all right in the car ?
yeah .
okay , good .
i just ...
i got to tell you , i' m not up for this thumb deal .
i say we don' t do it .
you trying to test me ?
is that it ?
you wanna see if i' m gonna do what i' m supposed to do ?
no .
so , what are you , a contractor with a conscience ?
look , i' ve done some bad things ... but i didn' t sign on to this to be a brutal street thug .
because , as far as i' m concerned , that' s not the job i took .
how would you get around it ?
i' d work it out .
but first i got to know , are you with me ?
sure .
sure or yes ?
that' s the same thing .
no , it' s not the same thing .
see , if i were to ask you to move my couch for me you' d probably say , " sure .
but if i were to ask you to look deep into my eyes ... and tell me from the bottom of your heart ... if it would give you great pleasure if i were to suck your cock for 12 hours ... if i may be presumptuous , you' d probably say , " yes .
see , it just implies a different level of commitment .
ask me the question again .
okay .
are you with me ?
yes .
yeah ?
good .
isn' t this b level ?
isn' t this b level ?
this is d level .
you shouldn' t be here .
i' m looking for b level .
this is a d level and no one is allowed here .
you need to go back to b level .
hold on .
because you' re confusing me , okay ?
you' re confusing me .
let' s just start from the beginning .
if this isn' t b ...
oh , my god .
i am so sorry .
that' s okay .
just soak that in cold water and it' il come right out , okay ?
i promise you .
yes .
no , it will .
the thing is , the reason i' m here is they told me to go around the corner ...
close your eyes .
what ?
close your eyes .
follow me .
just walk in .
don' t look .
come on .
go .
you' re fine .
can i open them ?
no .
stand right here .
it' s cold in here .
don' t look at nothing .
all right ?
can i open them ?
no .
stay turned around .
smells like my grandmother' s .
what was that ?
it' s nothing .
i like big butts and i cannot lie the other brothers can' t deny when the girls walk in with an itty bitty waist and round things in your face you get sprung , wanna pull up tough ' cause you notice that butt was stuffed ' cause i' m long , and i' m strong and i' m down to get the friction on so , ladies , yeah ladies , yeah if you wanna roll in my mercedes yeah so turn around !
stick it out !
even white boys got to shout baby got back !
baby got back !
that' s an old school song .
you' re old school , too , larry .
we got an item that we want to package ourselves and , you know ...
mail out .
okay .
could we just get an envelope from you ?
what size would you like ?
just the top , right ...
6 by 9 .
so all right .
we' re done , right ?
that' s it .
thanks .
would you like your parcel insured ?
no , that' s all right .
i' il be right back .
friend of yours ?
close , personal .
you know something ?
you' re right .
it is sadness .
i' m fucking sad .
you got me .
you' re a genius .
you know why i' m fucking sad ?
because i got this fucking ... beautiful , sexy , gorgeous ... heartthrob o rama , fucking smart , amazing bombshell ... 17 on a fucking 10 scale girl ... sleeping in a bed , right next to me .
and you know what ?
she' s a stone cold dyke .
a fucking untouchable ... unhaveable , unattainable brick wall ... fucking dykeasaurus rexi .
so it' s sad , okay ?
what do you want me to do ?
i feel fucking sadness about that .
there' s nothing i can fucking do .
and not only is she a major babe ... but i really like this girl a lot .
a lot .
she' s not like anybody else i ever knew before ... and that' s a completely fucking new one on me .
i don' t even know her real fucking name .
so there you go .
and in case you' re interested , my life sucks .
all right ?
stick a fork in me , i' m done .
clean the bar all you like .
i' m just going to puke on it again .
oh , you got me .
oh !
i got you !
do you think your fingernails need trimming ?
they' re fine .
what ?
you don' t like my fingernails now ?
look , i have no idea if this is true or not , but i' ve heard it said ... that those who are balanced more toward the masculine of either sex ... check their fingernails this way .
and those balanced more toward the feminine check them that way .
i had a feeling that even though you have this tough guy thing going on ... that you are wrestling with some very strong feminine leanings .
that' s fucking bullshit .
i can' t see .
i' m farsighted .
nearsighted , whatever it is .
so i hold them out here but i can' t see them up close .
to find out how somebody' s balanced toward a masculine , look at me .
i can' t see .
that' s why i hold them far away .
all right .
yeah , it is all right .
no , all right .
i was gonna do this .
that' s what i wanna do .
but i know i can' t see so i hold them out there to look at them .
all right .
don' t give me that look .
i see you looking at me .
are you gay ?
what the fuck .
no .
i' m not gay !
why do you look at me and think i' m gay ?
i' m not fucking gay !
are you sure ?
yeah , i' m fucking sure .
you know what , i bet you' re right .
thank you .
it wasn' t a compliment .
ricki , whatever your real name is , all right , this is my eyes .
look how i' m acting .
you' re driving me crazy .
you give me a fucking headache .
i don' t even know why i had a crush on you , back a long time ago when i first met you ... that you really cured me of .
i don' t know .
maybe it' s because you know i can kick your ass .
maybe that turns you on .
you cannot kick my ass .
what ?
you need a woman .
i got one .
stop .
kiss me again .
i thought you wanted to be my bitch .
this is so fucked up .
where you going ?
it' s turkey time .
gobble , gobble .
what ?
now , you talk the talk ... you know i' m expecting you to walk the walk .
come on .
show me what i' ve been missing my whole life .
lay some of that sweet " heterolingus " on me .
i think ... to be serious ...
i just ...
you know , i think ...
i was thinking , you know , and you were right ... when you said probably , actually a woman might know more ... about what feels better to another woman .
she' s a woman herself .
a guy might be at a certain disadvantage .
you know , like ...
it' s like , you need a handicap .
you know , like golf .
shut up and get over here .
god bless you , penis .
what' d you say ?
nothing .
every relationship has a bull and a cow ?
that' s right .
just to be up front about all this ... when this gig is over ...
i want you to know that i' m going to be leaving .
listen ... you and trixie over there , meet me at beverly and lomitas .
louis , what' s going on ?
and don' t bring the thing .
the what ?
the thing .
don' t bring it .
what thing ?
the thing .
don' t bring ...
don' t bring it .
you mean the ...  yeah .
don' t bring it .
you leave it somewhere safe for the time being .
all right .
you understand ?
yeah , i understand .
and hurry up , jackass .
what ?
it' s louis .
fucking pissed .
see this ?
some cookies in there .
be back .
when are you coming back ?
soon .
just relax , eat your breakfast .
okay ?
i' m not hungry , though .
well , you can' t skip breakfast .
it' s a very important meal .
all right ?
don' t go nowhere .
don' t touch nothing .
don' t make phone calls .
i' m not kidding .
all right , larry .
all right .
see you later .
bye , ricki .
bye , brian .
what ?
nothing .
you know , i got this fantasy .
about making it with a guy ?
no .
that' s not it .
going somewhere , you know , like , somewhere really ...
clean .
clean ?
yeah .
no scumbags telling you what to do .
nobody yelling at you all the time .
someplace you could just be .
be yourself .
no bad stuff .
that sounds good .
what' s up ?
we have a visitor from new york .
follow me .
hello .
welcome .
nice to meet you .
hello , sir .
finally .
nice to meet you , too .
come .
look at you .
beautiful .
come on in .
here .
grab a couch .
sit , sit .
i say everything twice .
in , in .
sit , sit .
i' m so glad you could come ... on such a short notice , too .
thank you , i really appreciate it .
i really ...
i thank you .
i appreciate it .
here , i' ve got some stuff .
i' m sorry if i' m a bit of a mess , but i just got in a few hours ago .
i' m sure louis told you , you know , i' m having ... some little legal problems out here right now .
what are you gonna do ?
it' s a nuisance , but what are you going to do ?
i got to fight it , right ?
i mean , i can' t go to jail .
that just can' t happen .
i' m used to the finer things .
louis , am i right ?
you are right .
it can' t be .
so i think we can say ... beyond a shadow of a doubt , that it' s not gonna happen .
somewhere a mistake has been made .
did you know ... that apparently some people ... do not regard the thumb , technically , to be a finger ?
curious for myself , i turned to louis here ... who with his newfound dictionary skills looked it up for me .
you know what it said ?
no .
tell him what it said , louis .
the short , thick , inner digit of the hand next to the forefinger . " unquote .
now it said , " digit , " not " finger .
so i still don' t really know , technically , if it' s considered a finger or not .
right ?
right .
right .
look at him .
i love him .
i love this guy .
he eats no matter what .
i love you , louis .
what' s this ?
what is this ?
louis .
i' ve been subpoenaed .
i can' t be consorting with armed felons .
a little consideration , please .
besides , you think something like this is necessary ... anyway , to intimidate people ?
i say intimidation comes from within .
there are a multitude of qualities an individual can possess ... that make them intimidating .
not only this , this is the outside .
then there' s the inside .
but you know what' s the most intimidating quality ?
not that you asked .
but the absolutely most intimidating in my opinion ?
when an individual just doesn' t give a shit .
louis , you want to go to medical school ?
medical school ?
yes !
students there can always use something to learn on .
i feel like i' m floating .
i feel ... released .
i don' t give a shit .
i don' t .
i have no compunctions ... none whatsoever .
and i am very concerned ... about the way things have turned out here .
how was the bleeding ?
the bleeding ?
no , not him .
the retard , when you cut his thumb off .
louis told me you were concerned .
bleeding was fine .
fine ?
it was all right .
okay .
good .
i didn' t need your help , you know .
i could have beaten these charges .
what were you thinking ?
you were gonna extort a federal prosecutor .
kidnapped your little brother , drop all charges , " and the guy' d roll over ?
you didn' t think all hell wouldn' t break loose ?
you didn' t think every fucking fed ... wouldn' t drop what they were doing ... and dive in to protect one of their own ?
what do you morons think ... this is little italy ?
wake up !
this is the twenty fucking first century !
so now ...
things are bad .
and whether you wanna call a thumb ... a finger or a digit ... for the sake of this discussion , it doesn' t really matter .
you know why ?
because whatever you choose to call it ... a thumb ... has a fingerprint ... and the one you sent ... had the wrong fucking one .
mr. starkman ...
i know my fucking name ... you piece of shit !
you don' t try to extort ... a federal fucking prosecutor !
and if you do ... you don' t fuck around !
fuck this .
cutting off his thumb was a stupid order .
we would have been derelict in our responsibilities if we had followed it .
hello .
how long could we have kept below radar ... with a thumbless , bleeding half wit ?
you see , sometimes ... one has to use their professional prerogative ... to override a dumb request .
with all due respect ... even at this point if you were to ask us ... to pursue a course of action that would be ...
let' s say , contrary to your best interests ... then as awkward as it might be ... we would have to take exception .
aside from those of us in this room ... there' s only one person , really , that can link you to this fuckup .
and i feel that we should ... rectify that problem as soon as we can .
i think i' d much prefer just to ... you know ... end it right here .
and that would be your professional prerogative .
if you think that having that kid picked up by the authorities ... and telling them all about being kidnapped in an attempt to save your ass makes sense .
if you think that' s the best tactic to keep you out of jail .
if you think that' s any less dumb than asking to have his finger cut off ... well , then that would be the thing that you should do .
but if you don' t ... then let us take the thorn out of your side .
let us make sure that kid will never be able to testify against anybody .
and if after that you' re still not happy ... then we can all talk again .
you were kidding , right ?
what do you think ?
we' il take brian back to where you found him and get out of here .
are we going to the baywatch now ?
no , we can' t go to the baywatch now .
take you later .
maybe this is it .
maybe this is the thing .
maybe this is a sign coming from nowhere , from out of the blue ... just telling me it' s time .
it' s time to get out .
it' s time to do it .
when i' m alone in my room sometimes i stare at the wall and in the back of my mind i hear my conscience call telling me i need a girl who' s as sweet as a dove for the first time in my life i see i need love so if you know who you are why don' t you make yourself seen take a chance with my love you' il find out what i mean i need love
i need love
let me ask you something .
you got a girlfriend ?
no , i don' t .
let me do something for you .
you know , make up for all the problems i caused you .
because i see you' re a little nervous around women .
right ?
let me tell you something .
you got no reason to be shy .
there' s no magic to it .
let me tell you this thing that i heard , and i' m starting to believe that it' s true .
you know ?
it' s that the thing you' re most afraid of in life ... if you do it , if you step up , good things will happen .
you see a girl that you like that you' re scared to talk to ... bro , step up .
hi , how are you today ?
nice weather we' re having .
take it from there , wherever the conversation goes .
you try it .
try it with me .
practice .
go ahead .
hello , how are you today ?
try it with me .
go ahead .
just say it .
hello , how are you today ?
come on , brian .
hello .
how are you today ?
how are you today ?
nice weather we' re having .
nice weather we' re having .
there you go .
you see how he did it ?
it' s because you stepped up , brian .
if you' re afraid , step up and good things start to happen .
am i right ?
i stepped up .
step it up , pimp .
that' s how you move .
step it up .
so , now that we' re partners in crime ... how about telling me your real name .
the reason that i ask that ... is because i don' t know if you gave it any thought since last night ... but i' ve been thinking about it .
and seeing ...
you know , looks like now we' re both going to be leaving .
so i thought , you know ...
all right , look .
i' m gonna lay it all out there for you right now .
i' m just gonna say it , because , you know , here i am .
i think ...
larry .
you know i haven' t done this kind of thing hardly ever .
the whole man thing ... doesn' t really hold that much for me , usually .
i know .
but somehow you got through .
somehow .
but in the end ...
i don' t think i could ever be what you really want .
so where do you think you' il go ?
i don' t know .
somewhere clean .
you know , northern california ...
oregon maybe .
you could just drop me off near the pacific coast highway ...
and i' il figure it out from there .
okay .
after that , brian , i think it' s gonna be time to go home .
we just left there a little while ago , though .
i don' t mean my apartment .
i mean , you know , the place where you live .
where i got you .
what , you mean to stay ?
yeah , buddy .
to stay .
oh , my god .
it' s open .
oh , my god .
what are you doing ?
sit down .
oh , my god .
i' m gonna go .
brian , what ?
what' s he talking about ?
they' re open .
they' re open .
oh , my god .
the baywatch .
they' re open !
cowabunga !
oh , my god .
that' s the baywatch ?
it' s open .
it' s the baywatch .
hello there !
i can' t believe this .
i can' t believe .
stop .
we can' t stop now .
no , we have to stop !
no , larry , no !
they' re here .
we' re here .
i know .
we can' t , though .
i' m sorry .
we can' t stop .
we' re here .
come on .
we' re here .
we' re right here .
brian .
wait .
that' s it .
we' re right here .
wait a second .
wait .
so turn around now , okay ?
all right .
what do you think ?
can i go down there ?
brian , you can' t go down there , no .
i mean , we' re not allowed down there .
plus , we got to go soon .
please ?
please , can i go down there ?
you know , brian , i don' t even think ...
this might not even be the baywatch .
i think this is probably something else .
larry , you promised me .
you promised me .
it' s right there .
i know .
just for five minutes ?
brian , what' s your brother' s name ?
my brother' s name is stinky jimmy dorf .
want to know why ?
yeah , some other time , i do .
yeah , los angeles .
the u. s. courthouse .
the office of a james dorf .
because ...
do you want to know why ?
yeah .
because sometimes he smells like fish .
no , i don' t think so .
yeah , i' il give you my name .
give me a minute .
hold on .
i forgot it .
brian , look at me .
i think your brother and his friends are gonna be here soon to pick you up .
okay ?
i want you to know something .
you' re a good kid .
i' m sorry about all the ...
i' m sorry for being ...
i' m sorry .
i think you' re wrong .
i think that is the baywatch right there .
who knows .
maybe it is .
i' m a genius , man .
i knew it .
you take good care of yourself , brian .
you take good care of yourself , larry .
i' il do that .
brian , let me ask you something .
how do your fingernails look ?

don' t say nothing .
they look very good .
i got a plus nails .
i give an a plus for fingernails .
never mind .
okay .

i don' t know how you' re thinking about getting out of here or whatever ... what your plans are ...
but i think you should take my car .
go ahead , take it .
take it .
i couldn' t do that , larry .
i' d rather ...
you know , i' d prefer if you had it .
it' s a good car , and i want you to be all right .
and i know that it' il get you wherever you need to go .
so just , you know , take it .
i was thinking about getting rid of it anyway .
i' m trying to change my image .

fair enough .
what ?
you know , i bet you' d look awesome in some mascara .
i' m not sure how to take that .
it' s a compliment .
