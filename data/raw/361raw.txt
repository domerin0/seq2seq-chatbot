13 meters .
you should see it .

seeing her coming out of the darkness like a ghost ship still gets me every time ...
to see the sad ruin of the great ship sitting here where she landed at 2 : 30 in the morning of april 15 , 1912 after her long fall from the world above .
you are so full of shit , boss .
dive six ...
here we are again on the deck of titanic 21/ 2 miles down 3, 821 meters .
the pressure outside is 31/ 2 tons per square inch .
these windows are nine inches thick and if they go it' s sayonara in two microseconds .
all right , enough of that bullshit .

hell yes !
floor debris in the suite , the mother' s room , purser' s safe on c deck .
jimmy hoffa' s briefcase .
a dozen other places .
guys , look , you' ve just got to trust my instincts .
i know we' re close .
we just got to go through a little process of elimination .
hang on a second .
let me see that .
we might have something here , guys .
where' s the photograph of the necklace ?
we' il call you right back .
i' il be goddamned .
treasure hunter brock lovett is best known for finding spanish gold .
it' s okay .
i' il feed you in a minute .
the titanic .
he is with us live via satellite from the research ship keldysh in the north atlantic .
hello , brock .
hello , tracy .
everyone knows the familiar stories of titanic ... the nobility , the band playing till the very end and all that .
but what i' m interested in are the untold stories the secrets locked deep inside the hull of titanic .
we' re out here using robot technology to go further into the wreck than anybody' s ever done before .
your expedition is at the center of a storm of controversy over salvage rights and even ethics .
many are calling you a grave robber .
nobody called the recovery of artifacts of king tut' s tomb " grave robbing .
what is it ?
turn that up , dear .
i have museum trained experts out here making sure that these relics are preserved and catalogued properly .
a piece of paper that' s been underwater for 84 years and my team were able to preserve it intact .
should this have remained unseen at the bottom of the ocean for eternity ?
i' il be goddamned .
vnimanye , vnimanye ...
brock !
there' s a satellite call for you .
bobby , we' re launching .
you see these submersibles going in the water ?
trust me , buddy .
you want to take this call .
this better be good .
you got to speak up .
she' s kind of old .
great .
this brock lovett .
how can i help you , mrs ...
calvert .
rose calvert .
mrs. calvert ?
i was just wondering if you had found the heart of the ocean yet , mr. lovett .
told you you wanted to take the call .
all right , you have my attention , rose .
can you tell us who the woman in the picture is ?
oh , yes .
the woman in the picture is me .
she' s a goddamned liar ...
some nut case seeking money or publicity .
god only knows why , like that russian babe , anesthesia .
they' re inbound !
rose dewitt bukater died on the titanic when she was 17 , right ?
that' s right .
if she had lived , she' d be over 100 .
101 next month .
okay , so she' s a very old goddamned liar .
look , i' ve already done the background on this woman all the way back to the ' 20s when she was working as an actress .
an actress !
there' s your first clue , sherlock .
her name was rose dawson back then .
then she marries this guy named calvert .
they move to cedar rapids and she punches out a couple of kids .
now , calvert' s dead , and from what i hear , cedar rapids is dead .
and everybody who knows about the diamond is supposed to be dead or on this boat , but she knows .
doesn' t exactly travel light , does she ?
mrs. calvert , i' m brock lovett .
welcome to the keldysh .
okay , let' s get her inside there .
hi , ms. calvert .
hi .
welcome to the keldysh .
hey .
hey !
yes ?
are your staterooms all right ?
oh , yes , very nice .
have you met my granddaughter lizzie ?
she takes care of me .
we met just a few minutes ago .
remember , nana , up on deck ?
there , that' s nice .
have to have my pictures when i travel .
can i get you anything ?
is there anything you' d like ?
yes .
i would like to see my drawing .
louis xvi wore a fabulous stone that was called the blue diamond of the crown which disappeared in 1792 about the same time old louis lost everything from the neck up .
the theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped , too recut into a heart like shape that became known as " heart of the ocean .
today it would be worth more than the hope diamond .
it was a dreadful , heavy thing .
i only wore it this once .
you actually think this is you , nana ?
it is me , dear .
wasn' t i a dish ?
i tracked it down through insurance records ...
an old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy .
can you tell me who the claimant was , rose ?
i should imagine someone named hockley .
nathan hockley , that' s right .
pittsburgh steel tycoon .
claim was for a diamond necklace his son caledon bought his fiancee ... you a week before he sailed on titanic .
it was filed right after the sinking so the diamond had to have gone down with the ship .
you see the date ?
april 14 , 1912 .
which means if your grandmother is who she says she is she was wearing the diamond the day the titanicsank .
and that makes you my new best friend .
these are some of the things we recovered from your stateroom .
this was mine .
how extraordinary !
and it looks the same as it did the last time i saw it .
the reflection has changed a bit .
are you ready to go back to titanic ?
okay , here we go .
she hits the berg on the starboard side , right ?
she kind of bumps along punching holes like morse code ... dit dit dit ... along the side , below the waterline .
then the forward compartments start to flood .
now as the water level rises , it spills over the watertight bulkheads which unfortunately don' t go any higher than e deck .
so now as the bow goes down , the stern rises up slow at first , then faster and faster until finally she' s got her whole ass is sticking up in the air and that' s a big ass .
we' re talking 20, 000 , 30, 000 tons , okay ?
and the hull' s not designed to deal with that pressure , so what happens ?
she splits , right down to the keel and the stern falls back level .
then as the bow sinks , it pulls the stern vertical and finally detaches .
now , the stern section just kind of bobs there like a cork for a couple of minutes , floods and finally goes under about 2 : 20 a . m .
two hours and 40 minutes after the collision .
the bow section planes away landing about a half a mile away going 20 , 30 knots when it hits the ocean floor .
pretty cool , huh ?
thank you for that fine forensic analysis , mr. bodine .
of course , the experience of it was somewhat different .
will you share it with us ?
i' m taking her to rest .
no .
come on , nana .
no !
tape recorder .
tell us , rose .
it' s been 84 years .
it' s okay .
just try to remember anything ... anything at all .
do you want to hear this or not , mr. lovett ?
it' s been 84 years ... and i can still smell the fresh paint .
the china had never been used .
the sheets had never been slept in .
titanicwas called " the ship of dreams " and it was , it really was .
all third class passengers with a forward berth this way , please , this queue .
right here .
big boat , huh ?
daddy , it' s a ship .
you' re right .
i don' t see what all the fuss is about .
it doesn' t look any bigger than the mauritania .
you can be blase about some things , rose , but not about titanic .
it' s over 100 feet longer than mauritania and far more luxurious .
your daughter is far too difficult to impress , ruth .
so this is the ship they say is unsinkable .
it is unsinkable .
god himself could not sink this ship .
sir , you have to check your baggage through the main terminal .
it' s round that way , sir .
i put my faith in you , good sir .
now , kindly see my man .
yes , sir , my pleasure , sir .
if i can do anything at all .
oh , yes , right .
all the trunks from that car there 12 from here , and the safe ... to the parlor suite , rooms b 52 , 54 , 56 .
ladies ... better hurry .
my coat ?
i have it .
all third class passengers due here for a health inspection .
all third class passengers due here for health inspection .
head up .
welcome aboard , ma' am .
welcome to titanic .
it was the ship of dreams to everyone else .
to me it was a slave ship taking me back to america in chains .
outwardly , i was everything a well brought up girl should be .
inside , i was screaming .
jack , you are pazzo .
you bet everything we have .
when you got nothing you got nothing to lose .
sven ?
all right , moment of truth .
somebody' s life' s about to change .
fabrizio ?
niente .
niente .
olaf ?
nothing .
sven ?
uh oh .
two pair .
i' m sorry , fabrizio .
che" sorry ? " ma vaffanculo !
you bet all the money .
i' m sorry , you' re not going to see your mom again for a long time because we' re going to america .
full house , boys .

yeah !
dio mio , grazie !

figlio di puttana !
i' m going home !
i' m going home .
i go to america .
no , mate .
titanic go to america in five minutes .
come on .
come on .
here .
andiamo .
we' re riding in high style now .
we' re a couple of regular swells .
we' re practically goddamn royalty , ragazzo mio .
you see , it' s my destino !
like i told you , i go to america to be milionario .
whoa , whoa !
bastardo !
you' re pazzo !
maybe , but i' ve got the tickets .
come on , i thought you were fast .
aspetta !
wait , wait !
hey , wait !
we' re passengers .
passengers .
have you been through the inspection queue ?
of course .
anyway , we don' t have any lice .
we' re americans , both of us .
right , come aboard .
we' re the luckiest sons of bitches in the world , you know that ?
good bye !
you know somebody ?
of course not .
that' s not the point .
good bye !
i' il miss you !
good bye !
i' m going to never forget you .
all the way , darling .
360 , 360 .
excuse me , ma' am .
oh , right here .
hey , how you doing ?
jack .
nice to meet you .
i' m jack dawson .
nice to meet you .
how you doing ?
who says you get the top bunk ?
this is your private promenade deck , sir .
would you be requiring anything ?
hmm .
excuse me .
this one ?
no .
it had a lot of faces on it .
this is the one .
would you like all of them out , miss ?
yes , we need a little color in this room .
put it in there , in the wardrobe .
god , not those finger paintings again .
they certainly were a waste of money .
the difference between cal' s taste in art and mine is that i have some .
they' re fascinating , like being inside a dream or something .
there' s truth , but no logic .
what' s the artist' s name ?
something picasso .
" something picasso .
he won' t amount to a thing .
he won' t , trust me .
put the degas in the bedroom .
at least they were cheap .
ah , put it in the wardrobe .
at cherbourg , a woman came aboard named margaret brown .
we all called her molly .
history would call her " the unsinkable molly brown .
well , i wasn' t about to wait all day for you , sonny .
here , you think you can manage ?
her husband had struck gold someplace out west and she was what mother called " new money .
by the next afternoon , we were steaming west from the coast of ireland with nothing out ahead of us but ocean .
take her to sea , mr. murdoch .
let' s stretch her legs .
yes , sir .
all ahead full , mr. moody .
very good , sir .
all ahead full .
all ahead full !
come on , lads .
get moving .
what' s the reading ?
all right , let' s stoke them right up !
we' re going full ahead !
21 knots , sir .
hey , look , look , look !
look , look !
see it ?
there' s another one .
see him ?
look at that one .
look at him jump !
whoo hoo !
whoo !
i can see the statue of liberty already !
very small , of course .
i' m the king of the world !
she' s the largest moving object ever made by the hand of man in all history .
and our master shipbuilder , mr. andrews here designed her from the keel plates up .
well , i may have knocked her together but the idea was mr. ismay' s .
he envisioned a steamer so grand in scale and so luxurious in its appointments that its supremacy would never be challenged .
and here she is willed into solid reality .
hear , hear .
you know i don' t like that , rose .
she knows .
we' il both have the lamb , rare , with very little mint sauce .
hmm , you like lamb , right , sweet pea ?
are you going to cut her meat for her , too , there , cal ?
hey , uh , who thought of the name " titanic " ?
was it you , bruce ?
well , yes , actually .
i wanted to convey sheer size and the size means stability
luxury , and above all , strength .
do you know of dr. freud , mr. ismay ?
his ideas about the male preoccupation with size might be of particular interest to you .
what' s gotten into you ?
excuse me .
i do apologize .
she' s a pistol , cal .
hope you can handle her .
well , i may have to start minding ... what she reads from now on , won' t i , mrs. brown ?
freud ...
who is he ?
is he a passenger ?
it makes these waves , makes them spin .
the ship is nice , huh ?
yeah , it' s an irish ship .
is english , no ?
no , it was built in ireland .
15, 000 irishmen built this ship .
solid as a rock .
big irish hands .
that' s typical .
first class dogs come down here to take a shit .
uh , it lets us know where we rank in the scheme of things .
like we could forget ?
i' m tommy ryan .
jack dawson .
hello .
fabrizio .
hi .
do you make any money with your drawings ?
oh , forget it , boyo .
you' d as like have angels fly out your arse as get next to the likes of her .
do you mind ?
i hope you' re proud of this .
i saw my whole life as if i' d already lived it ... an endless parade of parties and cotillions yachts and polo matches always the same narrow people , the same mindless chatter .
i felt like i was standing at a great precipice with no one to pull me back no one who cared or even noticed .
don' t do it .
stay back .
don' t come any closer .
come on .
just give me your hand .
i' il pull you back over .
no !
stay where you are .
i mean it .
i' il let go .
no , you won' t .
what do you mean , no , i won' t ?
don' t presume to tell me what i will and will not do .
you don' t know me .
well , you would have done it already .
you' re distracting me .
go away .
i can' t .
i' m involved now .
you let go and i' m going to have to jump in there after you .
don' t be absurd .
you' il be killed .
i' m a good swimmer .
the fall alone would kill you .
it would hurt .
i' m not saying it wouldn' t .
to tell you the truth i' m a lot more concerned about that water being so cold .
how cold ?
freezing .
maybe a couple degrees over .
you ever , uh ... ever been to wisconsin ?
what ?
well , they have some of the coldest winters around .
i grew up there near chippewa falls .
i remember when i was a kid , me and my father , we went ice fishing out on lake wissota .
i know what ice fishing is !
sorry .
you just seem like , you know , kind of an indoor girl .
anyway , i , uh ...
i fell through some thin ice and i' m telling you ... water that cold , like right down there it hits you like a thousand knives stabbing you all over your body .
you can' t breathe , you can' t think ... at least not about anything but the pain .
which is why i' m not looking forward to jumping in there after you .
like i said ...
i don' t have a choice .
i guess i' m kind of hoping you' il come back over the rail and get me off the hook here .
you' re crazy .
that' s what everybody says , but with all due respect , miss
i' m not the one hanging off the back of a ship here .
come on .
come on , give me your hand .
you don' t want to do this .
whew !
i' m jack dawson .
rose dewitt bukater .
i' m going to have to get you to write that one down .
come on .
i got you !
come on .
come on !
help !
please !
help !
please !
please get me !
listen .
listen to me .
i' ve got you .
i won' t let go .
now pull yourself up .
come on .
come on .
that' s right .
you can do it .
i got you .
what' s all this ?
you stand back !
and don' t move an inch !
fetch the master at arms !
care for a brandy ?
this is completely unacceptable !
what made you think that you could put your hands on my fiancee ?
look at me , you filth !
cal ...
what do you think you were doing ?
cal , stop .
it was an accident .
an accident ?
it was .
stupid really .
i was leaning over , and i slipped .
i was leaning far over to see the , uh ... uh ... uh ... the , uh ... uh ...
propellers ?
propellers and i slipped .
and i would have gone overboard but mr. dawson here saved me and almost went over himself .
you wanted to see ...
she wanted to see the propellers .
like i said , women and machinery do not mix .
was that the way of it ?
yeah .
yeah , that was pretty much it .
well , the boy' s a hero then .
good for you , son .
well done .
so it' s all' s well and back to our brandy , eh ?
look at you .
you must be freezing .
let' s get you inside .
perhaps a little something for the boy .
of course .
mr. lovejoy , i think a 20 should do it .
is that the going rate for saving the woman you love ?
rose is displeased .
what to do ?
i know .
perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow evening to regale our group with ... your heroic tale .
sure , count me in .
good .
settled then .
this should be interesting .
mmm .
can i , uh ... bum a smoke ?
you' il want to tie those .
it' s interesting .
the young lady slips so suddenly and you still had time to remove your jacket and your shoes .
i know you' ve been melancholy .
i don' t pretend to know why .
i intended to save this until the engagement gala next week .
but i thought tonight .
good gracious .
perhaps as a reminder of my feelings for you .
is it a ...
diamond ?
yes .
56 carats to be exact .
it was worn by louis xvi and they called it " le coeur de la mer .
the heart of the ocean .
yes .
it' s overwhelming .
well , it' s for royalty .
we areroyalty , rose .
you know , there' s nothing i couldn' t give you .
there' s nothing i' d deny you if you would not deny me .
now open your heart to me , rose .
well , i' ve been on my own since i was 15 since my folks died .
and i had no brothers or sisters or close kin in that part of the country .
so i lit on out of there and i haven' t been back since .
you could just call me a tumbleweed blowing in the wind .
well , rose ... we' ve walked about a mile around this boat deck and chewed over how great the weather' s been and how i grew up but i reckon that' s not why you came to talk to me , is it ?
mr. dawson , i ...
jack .
jack ...
i want to thank you for what you did .
not just for ... for pulling me back but for your discretion .
you' re welcome .
look , i know what you must be thinking .
poor little rich girl .
what does she know about misery ?
no .
no , that' s not what i was thinking .
what i was thinking was what could have happened to this girl to make her think she had no way out ?
well , i ...
it was everything .
it was my whole world and all the people in it and the inertia of my life plunging ahead and me , powerless to stop it .
god !
look at that thing .
you would have gone straight to the bottom .
500 invitations have gone out .
all of philadelphia society will be there and all the while i feel i' m ... standing in the middle of a crowded room screaming at the top of my lungs and no one even looks up .
do you love him ?
pardon me ?
do you love him ?
you' re being very rude .
you shouldn' t be asking me this .
well , it' s a simple question .
do you love the guy or not ?
this is not a suitable conversation .
why can' t you just answer the question ?
this is absurd .
you don' t know me , and i don' t know you and we are not having this conversation at all .
you are rude and uncouth and presumptuous and i am leaving now .
jack .
mr. dawson , it' s been a pleasure .
i sought you out to thank you and now i have thanked you ...
and you' ve insulted me .
well , you deserved it .
right .
right .
i thought you were leaving .
i am .
you are so annoying .
wait .
i don' t have to leave .
this is my part of the ship .
you leave .
oh ho ho , well , well , well .
now who' s being rude ?
what is this stupid thing you' re carrying around ?
so what are you , an artist or something ?
well , these are rather good .
they' re , uh ...
they' re very good actually .
jack , this is exquisite work .
they didn' t think too much of them in old paree .
paris !
you do get around for a poor ...
well , uh , uh , a person of limited means .
go on , a poor guy , you can say it .
well , well , well .
and these were drawn from life ?
well , that' s one of the good things about paris ...
lots of girls willing to take their clothes off .
you liked this woman .
you used her several times .
well , she had beautiful hands , you see ?
i think you must have had a love affair with her .
no , no , no , no , no .
just with her hands .
she was a one legged prostitute .
see ?
oh !
ah , she had a good sense of humor , though .
oh , and this lady ... she used to sit at this bar every night wearing every piece of jewelry she owned just waiting for her long lost love .
called her madame bijou .
see how her clothes are all moth eaten ?
well , you have a gift , jack .
you do .
you see people .
i see you .
and ?
you wouldn' t have jumped .
but the purpose of university is to find a suitable husband .
rose has already done that .
look , here comes that vulgar brown woman .
quickly , get up before she sits with us .
hello , girls .
i was hoping i' d catch you at tea .
we' re awfully sorry you missed it .
the countess and i were just off to take the air on the boat deck .
what a lovely idea .
i need to catch up on my gossip .
countess .
so you' ve not yet lit the last four boilers ?
no , i don' t see the need .
we are making excellent time .
the press knows the size of titanic .
now i want them to marvel at her speed .
we must give them something new to print .
this maiden voyage of titanic must make headlines .
mr. ismay , i would prefer not to push the engines until they' ve been properly run in .
of course i' m just a passenger .
i leave it to your good offices to decide what' s best .
but what a glorious end to your final crossing if we were to get into new york on tuesday night and surprise them all .
make the morning papers .
retire with a bang , eh , e. j. ?
good man .
well , after that i worked on a squid boat in monterey .
then i went down to los angeles to the pier in santa monica and started doing portraits there for ten cents apiece .
why can' t i be like you , jack ... just head out for the horizon whenever i feel like it ?
say we' il go there sometime to that pier even if we only ever just talk about it .
no , we' il do it .
we' il drink cheap beer .
we' il ride on the roller coaster till we throw up .
then we' il ride horses on the beach right in the surf .
but you' il have to do it like a real cowboy .
none of that sidesaddle stuff .
you mean , one leg on each side ?
yeah .
can you show me ?
sure ... if you like .
teach me to ride like a man .
and chew tobacco like a man .
and spit like a man .
they didn' t teach you that in finishing school ?
no .
well , come on , i' il show you .
let' s do it .
i' il show you how .
come on .
jack , no !
jack , no !
wait , jack .
no , jack .
i couldn' t possibly , jack .
watch closely .
that' s disgusting !
all right , your turn .
that was pitiful !
come on , you really got to hawk it back , you know ?
get some leverage to it .
use your arms , arc your neck .
see the range on that thing ?
mm hmm .
okay , go .
that was better .
you got to work on it .
really ?
really try and hawk it up and get some body to it , you know ?
you got to ...
mother .
may i introducejack dawson ?
charmed , i' m sure .
the others were gracious and curious about the man who had saved my life but my mother looked at him like an insect ... a dangerous insect which must be squashed quickly .
well , jack , sounds like you' re a good man to have around in a sticky spot .
why do they always insist on announcing dinner like a damn cavalry charge ?
shall we go to dress , mother ?
see you at dinner , jack .
uh , son ?
son !
do you have the slightest comprehension what you' re doing ?
not really .
well , you' re about to go into the snake pit .
what are you planning to wear ?
i figured .
come on .
i was right .
you and my son are just about the same size .
pretty close .
you shine up like a new penny .
good evening , sir .
good evening .
hello .
do you know that there are several thousand tons of hockley steel in this very ship ?
hmm .
which part ?
all the right ones , of course .
then we' il know who to hold accountable if there' s a problem .
where' s my daughter ?
oh , she' il be along .
there is the countess .
hello , my dear .
good evening , cal .
so good to see you .
i saw that in a nickelodeon once and i always wanted to do it .
i' il see you at dinner .
darling ?
surely you remember mr. dawson .
dawson ?
well , it' s amazing .
you could almost pass for a gentleman .
almost .
extraordinary .
my dear , it' s delightful to see you .
what a remarkable voyage this is .
it' s mad , isn' t it ?
i love your perfume .
there' s the countess of rothes .
and , um , that' sjohn jacob astor ... the richest man on the ship .
his little wifey there , madeleine , is my age and in delicate condition .
see how she' s trying to hide it ?
quite the scandal .
hmm .
and that' s benjamin guggenheim and his mistress madame aubert .
mrs. guggenheim is at home with the children , of course .
and over here we have sir cosmo and lucille lady duff gordon .
she designs naughty lingerie , among her many talents .
very popular with the royals .
congratulations , hockley .
she' s splendid .
why , thank you .
care to escort a lady to dinner ?
certainly .
sweat pea ?
sweet pea .
ain' t nothin ' to it , is there , jack ?
remember , they love money , so just pretend like you own a gold mine ... and you' re in the club .
hey , astor !
well , hello , molly .
nice to see you .
j. j. madeleine , i' d like you to meetjack dawson .
how do you do ?
pleasure .
hello , jack .
are you of the boston dawsons ?
no ... the chippewa falls dawsons , actually .
oh , yes .
yes .
he must have been nervous , but he never faltered .
they assumed he was one of them ...
heir to a railroad fortune , perhaps .
new money , obviously , but still a member of the club .
mother , of course , could always be counted upon .
tell us of the accommodations in steerage , mr. dawson .
i hear they' re quite good on this ship .
the best i' ve seen , ma' am .
hardly any rats .
mr. dawson is joining us from the third class .
he was of some assistance to my fiancee last night .
it turns out that mr. dawson is quite a fine artist .
he was kind enough to show me some of his work today .
rose and i differ somewhat in our definition of fine art .
not to impugn your work , sir .
she may be mine on paper but in the eyes of god , she belongs to thomas andrews .
are these all for me ?
just start from the outside and work your way in .
he knows every rivet in her , don' t you , thomas ?
your ship is a wonder , truly .
thank you , rose .
and how do you take your caviar , sir ?
no caviar for me , thanks .
never did like it much .
and where , exactly , do you live , mr. dawson ?
well , right now , my address is the r. m. s. titanic .
after that , i' m on god' s good humor .
and how is it you have means to travel ?
i work my way from place to place ...
you know , tramp steamers and such .
but i won my ticket on titanichere at a lucky hand at poker .
a very lucky hand .
all life is a game of luck .
mmm .
a real man makes his own luck , archie .
right , dawson ?
mmm .
and you find that sort of rootless existence appealing , do you ?
well , yes , ma' am , i do .
i mean , got everything i need right here with me .
got air in my lungs and a few blank sheets of paper .
i mean , i love waking up in the morning not knowing what' s going to happen or who i' m going to meet , where i' m going to wind up .
just the other night , i was sleeping under a bridge , and now here i am on the grandest ship in the world having champagne with you fine people .
i' il take some more of that .
i figure life' s a gift , and i don' t intend on wasting it .
you never know what hand you' re going to get dealt next .
you learn to take life as it comes at you .
here you go , cal .
to make each day count .
well said , jack .
hear , hear !
to making it count .
to making it count .
bravo .
mr. brown had no idea i' d hidden the money in the stove .
so he comes home drunk as a pig , celebrating and he lights a fire .
next it' il be brandies in the smoking room .
well , join me in a brandy , gentlemen ?
now they retreat into a cloud of smoke and congratulate each other on being masters of the universe .
ladies , thank you for the pleasure of your company .
rose , may i escort you back to the cabin ?
no , i' il stay here .
here you go , molly .
joining us , dawson ?
you don' t want to stay out here with the women , do you ?
no , thanks .
i' ve got to be heading back .
ah .
probably best .
it' il be all business and politics , that sort of thing ...
wouldn' t interest you .
but dawson , good of you to come .
jack , must you go ?
time for me to go row with the other slaves .
good night , rose .
so you want to go to a real party ?
is okay i put my hand here ?
okay .
talla frikken svenska ?
what ?
i can' t understand you .
hey !
bravo , bravo !
thank you .
come on , guys .
let' s go !
i' m going to dance with her now , all right ?
come on .
what ?
come with me .
what ?
jack ...
jack , wait !
i can' t do this .
we' re going to have to get a little bit closer .
like this .
you' re still my best girl , cora .
i don' t know the steps .
neither do i.
just go with it .
don' t think .
hey .
wait , jack , jack !
wait !
stop , jack !
ba ba ba .
wait !
hey !
hey !
yeah !
jack , no !
whaaa !
... jurisdiction of the sherman act so my lawyers will argue .
that' s what rockefeller said , but the supreme court is not swallowing it .
what ?
you think a first class girl can' t drink ?
get out of here .
you all right ?
i' m fine .
two out of three , two out of three .
so ... you think you' re big , tough men ?
let' s see you do this .
hold this for me , jack .
hold it up .
ow !
jesus , mary and joseph !
you all right ?
i haven' t done that in years .
go see maggie , lads .
give her the holley !
let' s go !
ho !
coffee , sir ?
i had hoped you would come to me last night .
i was tired .
your exertions below decks were no doubt exhausting .
i see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me .
how typical .
you will never behave like that again , rose .
do you understand ?
i' m not a foreman in one of your mills that you can command .
i' m your fiancee .
my fiancee ?
my fiancee ? !!
yes , you are , and my wife !
my wife in practice if not yet by law , so you will honor me .
you will honor me the way a wife is required to honor a husband .
because i will not be made out a fool , rose .
is this in any way unclear ?
no .
good .
excuse me .
miss rose !
we had a little ... accident .
that' s all right , miss rose .
that' s all right .
i' m sorry , trudy .
let me help you .
it' s all right , miss .
it' s all right , miss .
tea , trudy .
yes , ma' am .
you' re not to see that boy again , do you understand me ?
rose , i forbid it .
oh , stop it , mother .
you' il give yourself a nosebleed .
this is not a game .
our situation is precarious .
you know the money' s gone .
of course i know it' s gone .
you remind me every day .
your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name .
that name is the only card we have to play .
i don' t understand you .
it is a fine match with hockley .
it will ensure our survival .
how can you put this on my shoulders ?
why are you being so selfish ?
i' m being selfish ?
do you want to see me working as a seamstress ?
is that what you want ?
to see our fine things sold at auction ?
our memories scattered to the winds ?
it' s so unfair .
of course it' s unfair .
we' re women .
our choices are never easy .
hmm ?
congregation : & protect them by thy guardian hand & & from every peril on the land . & & o spirit , whom the father sent & & to spread across the firmament & & o wind of heaven , by thy might & & save all who dare the eagle' s flight & & and keep them by thy watchful ... &
hello , mr. andrews .
hello , jack .
sir .
i need to talk to somebody for a sec .
you' re not supposed to be in here . & ... fire and foe protect them ... &
i was just here last night .
you don' t remember me ?
no , i' m afraid i don' t .
now you' re going to have to turn around .
he' il tell you .
i just ...
i just need ...
mr. hockley and mrs. dewitt bukater continue to be appreciative of your assistance .
they asked me to , uh ... give you this in gratitude .
i don' t want your money .
please , i ...
and also to remind you ... that you hold a third class ticket and that your presence here is no longer appropriate .
please , i just want to speak to rose for ...
gentlemen , will you please see that mr. dawson gets to where he belongs and that he stays there ?
yes , sir .
come along , you .
& oh , hear us when we cry to thee & & for those in peril on the sea . &
and why do you have two steering wheels ?
we really only use this near shore .
excuse me , sir .
another ice warning .
this one' s from the noordam .
thank you , sparks .
oh , not to worry .
quite normal for this time of year .
in fact , we' re speeding up .
i' ve just ordered the last boilers lit .
okay , son , wind it up tight like i showed you .
okay , now , let it go .
was good , wasn' t it ?
quite nice .
that' s excellent , son .
mr. andrews , forgive me ...
i did the sum in my head and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned forgive me , but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard .
about half , actually .
rose , you miss nothing , do you ?
in fact , i put in these new type davits which can take an extra row of boats inside this one but it was thought by some that the deck would look too cluttered so i was overruled .
waste of deck space as it is on an unsinkable ship .
sleep soundly , young rose .
i have built you a good ship , strong and true .
she' s all the lifeboat you need .
just keep heading aft .
the next stop will be the engine room .
come on .
jack , this is impossible .
i can' t see you .
i need to talk to you .
no , jack , no .
jack , i' m engaged .
i' m marrying cal .
i love cal .
rose , you' re no picnic .
all right , you' re a spoiled little brat , even but under that you' re the most amazingly astounding wonderful girl ... woman ... that i' ve ever known and ...
jack , i ...
no , let me try and get this out .
you' re , you' re ama ...
i' m not an idiot .
i know how the world works .
i' ve got ten bucks in my pocket .
i have nothing to offer you and i know that .
i understand .
but i' m too involved now .
you jump , i jump , remember ?
i can' t turn away without knowing you' il be all right .
that' s all that i want .
well , i' m fine .
i' il be fine , really .
really ?
i don' t think so .
they' ve got you trapped , rose and you' re going to die if you don' t break free ...
maybe not right away because you' re strong , but sooner or later that fire that i love about you , rose ... that fire is going to burn out .
it' s not up to you to save me , jack .
you' re right .
only you can do that .
i' m going back .
leave me alone .
tell lucille about the disaster you had with the stationer' s .
well , of course , the invitations had to be sent back twice .
oh , my dear !
and the dreadful bridesmaid' s gowns ...
let me tell you what an odyssey that has been .
rose decided she wanted lavender .
she knows i detest the color , so she did it only to spite me .
if only you' d come to me sooner .
ruth saw some of my designs in " la mode illustree .
they were for trousseau of the duchess of malborough' s youngest daughter .
they were quite charming , but i think you' il agree , my dear , that together we' ve created something of a phoenix from the ashes .
hello , jack .
i changed my mind .
they said you might be ...
shh .
give me your hand .
now close your eyes .
go on .
step up .
now hold on to the railing .
keep your eyes closed , don' t peek .
i' m not .
step up onto the rail .
hold on .
hold on .
keep your eyes closed .
do you trust me ?
i trust you .
all right , open your eyes .
i' m flying !
jack !
: & come , josephine , my flying machine & & going up , she goes & & up , she goes ... &
that was the last time titanic ever saw daylight .
so we' re up to dusk the night of the sinking .
six hours to go .
incredible .
there' s smith and he' s standing there and he' s got the iceberg warning ... in his fucking hand ... excuse me ... his hand , and he' s ordering more speed .
26 years of experience working against him .
he figures anything big enough to sink the ship they' re going to see in time to turn but the ship' s too big with too small a rudder .
doesn' t corner worth a damn .
everything he knows is wrong .
it' s quite proper , i assure you .
this is the sitting room .
will this light do ?
what ?
don' t artists need good light ?
that is true but i' m not used to working in such horrible conditions .
monet !
do you know his work ?
of course .
look at his use of color here .
isn' t he great ?
i know , it' s extraordinary .
cal insists on carting this hideous thing everywhere .
should we be expecting him anytime soon ?
not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out .
that' s nice .
what is it , a sapphire ?
a diamond , a very rare diamond .
jack , i want you to draw me like one of your french girls ... wearing this .
all right .
wearing onlythis .
the last thing i need is another picture of me
looking like a porcelain doll .
as a paying customer ...
i expect to get what i want .
over on the bed ... the couch .
go ... lie down .
tell me when it looks right .
put your arm back the way it was .
right .
put that other arm up , that hand right by your face there .
right .
now , head down .
eyes to me , keep them on me .
and try to stay still .
so serious .
i believe you are blushing , mr. big artiste .
i can' t imagine monsieur monet blushing .
he does landscapes .
just relax your face .
sorry .
no laughing .
my heart was pounding the whole time .
it was the most erotic moment of my life .
up until then , at least .
so what happened next ?
you mean , did we do it ?
sorry , to disappoint you , mr. bodine .
jack was very professional .
thank you .
what you doing ?
will you put this back in the safe for me ?
mm hmm .
would you excuse me ?
none of the stewards have seen her .
this is absurd .
it' s a ship , there' s only so many places she could be .
lovejoy , find her .
clear .
yes .
i don' t think i' ve ever seen such a flat calm .
like a mill pond .
not a breath of wind .
it will make the bergs harder to see with no breaking water at the base .
hmm .
well , i' m off .
maintain speed and heading , mr. lightoller .
yes , sir .
it' s getting cold .
you look nice .
miss rose ?
my drawings !
come on !
no , wait , wait !
wait , wait , wait !
go , go !
down , down !
quickly , quickly !
bye !
sorry !
it' s all right !
pretty tough for a valet , this fellow .
seems more like a cop .
i think he was .
oh , shit .
no , over here !
quick !
now what ? !
what ? !
hold up !
what' re you two doing down here ?
you shouldn' t be down here !
it could be dangerous !
carry on !
don' t mind us .
you' re doing a great job !
keep up the good work !
ah , look what we have here , huh ?
thank you .
where to , miss ?
to the stars .
you nervous ?
no .
put your hands on me , jack .
god , it' s bloody cold .
you know , i can smell ice , you know , when it' s near .
bollocks .
but i can , all right !
did you ever find those binoculars for the lookouts ?
haven' t seen them since southampton .
well , i' il be on my rounds .
cheerio .
you' re trembling .
don' t worry .
i' il be all right .
they ran down there .
right .
anything missing ?
i' ve got a better idea .
gotcha !
did you see those guys ' faces ?
did you see the ...
when the ship docks ...
i' m getting off with you .
this is crazy .
i know .
it doesn' t make any sense .
that' s why i trust it .
oh , yes .
here , look at this .
oh , look at that , would you ?
they' re a bit warmer than we are .
well , if that' s what it takes for us to get warmer i' d rather not , if it' s all the same to you .
bugger me !
pick up , you bastards !
is there anyone there ?
yes , what do you see ?
iceberg !
right ahead !
thank you .
iceberg !
right ahead !
hard to starboard !
hard to starboard !
turn , turn !
steady !
full astern !
hard over .
helm' s hard over , sir .
go , lads !
go !
shut all the dampers !
shut them !
hold it .
hold it !
now , engage the reversing engine !
why aren' t they turning ? !
is it hard over ? !
it is , yes , sir , hard over !
come on , come on , come on .
turn .
yes .
it' s going to hit !
jesus christ .
jesus .
hard to port !
hard to port !
get back !
come on , let' s go !
get out the door !
they' re closing the doors !
get out !
get out !
get out !
get out !
get out the door !
go on !
go on !
come on , lads !
go , lads , go !
get out !
oh , my god .
that was a close shave , weren' t it ?
smell ice , can you ?
bleeding christ .
note the time and enter it in the log .
what was that , mr. murdoch ?
an iceberg , sir .
i put her hard to starboard and ran the engines full astern but it was too close .
i tried to port round it but she hit and the ...
close the watertight doors .
the doors are closed , sir .
all stop .
aye , sir !
find the carpenter .
get him to sound the ship .
yes , sir !
porca puttana !
che cazzo e ?
come on , let' s get the hell out of here !
come on , hurry up .
excuse me .
why have the engines stopped ?
i felt a shudder .
i shouldn' t worry , madam .
we' ve likely thrown a propeller blade .
that' s the shudder you felt .
may i bring you anything ?
no , thank you .
did you see anything ?
i don' t see anything now , do you ?
if this is the direction the rats are going that' s good enough for me .
please , sir , please .
everything' s under control .
you there .
sir , there is no emergency .
yes , there is , i have been robbed .
get the master at arms .
now , you moron !
yes , sir .
hey , you' re going to miss the fun .
did you see what happened ?
no , i missed it .
apparently , it hit over there .
boiler room six is flooded eight feet above the plate .
and the mail hold is worse .
she' s all buckled in in the forward hold .
can you shore up ?
not unless the pumps get ahead .
have you seen the damage in the mail hold ?
no , she' s already underwater .
this is bad .
we should tell mother and cal .
i think they' re very good , sir .
don' t touch anything .
i want the entire room photographed .
just keep holding my hand .
we' ve been looking for you , miss .
well , here we go .
something serious has happened .
yes , it has .
indeed .
two things dear to me have disappeared this evening .
now that one is back i have a pretty good idea where to find the other .
search him .
take your coat off , sir .
now what ?
come on .
cal , what are you doing ?
we' re in the middle of an emergency .
what' s going on ?
is this it ?
that' s it .
this is horseshit !
don' t you believe it , rose .
don' t !
he couldn' t have .
of course he could .
it' s easy enough for a professional .
but i was with him the whole time .
this is absurd .
perhaps he did it while you were putting your clothes back on , dear .
real slick , cal .
rose , they put it in my pocket .
shut up .
it isn' t even your pocket , is it , son ?
property of a. l. ryerson .
that was reported stolen today .
i just borrowed it .
i was going to return it .
we have an honest thief here , do we ?
you know i didn' t do this , rose .
you know it .
don' t you believe them , rose .
you know i didn' t do it .
come on , let' s go .
you know i didn' t do it , rose .
rose !
come on , son .
there' s a good lad .
come on .
you know i didn' t do it !
you know me !
most unfortunate , captain .
water ... 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes ...
in the forepeak , in all three holds and in the boiler room six .
that' s right , sir .
when can we get under way , damn it ?
that' s five compartments .
she can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached but not five ... not five .
as she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of bulkheads at e deck from one to the next .
back and back .
there' s no stopping it .
the pumps ...
if we opened the doors ...
the pumps buy you time , but minutes only .
from this moment , no matter what we do
titanicwill founder .
but this ship can' t sink .
she' s made of iron , sir .
i assure you , she can ... and she will .
it is a mathematical certainty .
how much time ?
an hour .
two at most .
and how many aboard , mr. murdoch ?
2, 200 souls on board , sir .
well , i believe you may get your headlines , mr. ismay .
oh , it is a little slut , isn' t it ?
will you look at me when i' m talking to you .
mr. hockley ?
not now , we' re busy .
sir , i' ve been told to ask you to please put on your lifebelts and come up to ...
i said not now .
i' m sorry to inconvenience you , mr. hockley , but it' s captain' s orders .
now , please , dress warmly .
it' s quite cold out tonight .
now , may i suggest topcoats and hats .
this is ridiculous .
not to worry , miss .
i am sure it' s just a precaution .
everybody up !
lifebelts on !
what' s he yelling about ?
everybody up !
put your lifebelts on !
what' s the ruckus ?
just put your lifebelts on !
c. qd . ?
sir ?
that' s right ...
c. qd .
the distress call .
that' s our position .
tell whoever responds that we' re going down by the head .
we need immediate assistance .
blimey .
keep lowering !
keep lowering !
mr. wilde !
mr. wilde , where are the passengers ?
we moved them back inside .
it' s too damn cold and noisy for them .
you there !
get down here and help with these lines .
care for a drink , sir ?
please put your lifebelts on .
hey , sonny , what' s doing ?
you got us all trussed up here and now we' re cooling our heels .
sorry , ma' am .
let me go and find out .
i don' t think anybody knows what the hell' s going on around here .
it' s the goddamned english doing everything by the book .
there' s no need for language , mr. hockley .
go back and turn the heaters on in our rooms .
i' d like a cup of tea when i return .
yes , ma' am .
mr. andrews .
i saw the iceberg and i see it in your eyes .
please tell me the truth .
the ship will sink .
you' re certain .
yes , in an hour or so ... all this will be at the bottom of the atlantic .
what ?
please , tell only who you must ?
i don' t want to be responsible for a panic and get to a boat quickly , don' t wait .
you remember what i told you about the boats ?
yes .
i understand .
over here , sir .
sir , they need you up in the second class purser' s office .
there' s a big mob up there .
go on , i' il keep an eye on him .
aye , right .
sir !
carpathiasays they' re making 17 knots .
full steam for them , sir .
she' s the only one responding ?
the only one close , sir .
she says they can be here in four hours .
four hours ?
thank you , bride .
my god .
sir !
we are swung out and ready , sir .
hadn' t we better get the women and children into the boat , sir ?
yes , we do .
sir ?
women and children first .
yes .
yes , sir .
ladies and gentlemen , your attention please !
step this way , please .
that' s right .
come towards me .
thank you .
good .
for the time being , i shall require only women and children .
right here .
all right , boys , like the captain said nice and cheery so there' s no panic .
wedding dance .
lifebelts on !
here , put your lifebelts on .
put your lifebelts on .
here , put your lifebelt on .
here , come on , here .
it isn' t time to go up to the boats yet .
please stay calm .
look , please , make sure , everybody , you' ve got your lifebelts on and gentlemen , allow the women and children through to the front .
what are we doing , mommy ?
we' re just waiting , dear .
when they' re finished putting the first class people in the boats ... they' il start with us and we' il want to be all ready , won' t we ?
go and get some help .
lower away !
left and right together !
steady !
both sides together .
steady !
steady !
steady !
stop !
stop !
hold the left side !
right side only !
right side only !
right side only !
hold the left side !
right side down !
lower away together !
steady , lads !
you know , i do believe this ship may sink .
i' ve been asked to give you this small token of our appreciation .
compliments of mr. caledon hockley .
come on , sister , you heard the man ... into the boat .
any room for a gentleman , gentlemen ?
only women at this time , sir .
will the lifeboats be seated according to class ?
i hope they' re not too crowded .
oh , mother , shut up !
don' t you understand ?
the water is freezing and there aren' t enough boats .
not enough by half .
half the people on this ship are going to die .
not the better half .
come on , ruth , get in the boat .
first class seats are right up here .
you know , it' s a pity i didn' t keep that drawing .
it' il be worth a lot more by morning .
you unimaginable bastard .
come on , rose , darling .
there' s plenty of room for you .
come on , rose .
you' re next , darling .
come into the boat , rose .
come .
rose , get into the boat .
rose .
good bye , mother .
rose !
rose , come back here !
where are you going ?
to him ?
to be a whore to a gutter rat ?
i' d rather be his whore than your wife .
no .
no !
i said no !
rose !
please stop !
and lower away !
rose !
man the tiller !
no , wait !
lower away !
rose !
lower together !
help !
can anybody hear me ?
hello , help me !
