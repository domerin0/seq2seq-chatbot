iil turn him into a flea , a harmless little flea ... and then iil put that flea in a box and then iil put that box inside of another box ... and then iil mail that box to myself , and when it arrives ...
iil smash it with a hammer !
its brilliant , brilliant , brilliant , i tell you !

kuzcos poison .
that poison ?
yes !
that poison .

a few drops in his drink , and then iil propose a toast ... and he will be dead before dessert .
which is a real shame , because its gonna be delicious .

so , no hard feelings about being let go ?
none whatsoever .
kronk , get the emperor a drink .

i mean , it might be difficult for someone of your age ... adjusting to life in the private sector .
hey , kronk , can you top me off , pal ?
be a friend ?
now , about you finding new work , thats thats gonna be tough .
hit him on the head .

what ?
a llama ?
hes supposed to be dead !
yeah , weird .
let me see that vial .
this isnt poison .

kronk , this is kind of important .
how about dessert ?
well , i suppose theres time for dessert .
and coffee ?
all right .

you killer jaguars
whoa !
dont worry , your highness .
i got ya .
youre safe now .
maybe im just new to this whole rescuing thing , but this , to me ... might be considered kind of a step backwards , wouldnt you say ?
no , no , no .
its its okay .
this this is all right .
we can figure this out .
i hate you .
no !
ow !
ow !
ow !
ow !
i dont know about you , but im getting all funned out .
uh oh .

most likely .
bring it on .
your highness .
your highness , can you hear me ?
oh , boy .
come on , breathe .
breathe !
oh .
why me ?
all right .
for the last time , it was not a kiss .
well , whatever you call it , it was disgusting .
and if you wouldve done what i ordered you to do in the first place ... we all couldve been spared your little kiss of life .
but now that youre here , you will take me back to the palace .
iil have yzma change me back , and then iil start construction on kuzcotopia .
oh , yeah .
okay , now look ...
i think we got off on the wrong foot here .
i just think if you really thought about it ... youd decide to build your home on a different hilltop .
and why would i do that ?
because ... deep down , i think youil realize that youre forcing an entire village ... out of their homes just for you .
and thats bad ?
well , yeah .
uh , nobodys that heartless .
now take me back .
what ?
wait , wait .
how can you be this way ?
all you care about is building your summer home and filling it with stuff for you .
uh , yeah .
doy .
me .
everyone else in the kingdom gets it .
youre the only one that doesnt seem to be with the programme , eh , pacha ?
you know what ?
someday , youre gonna wind up all alone ... and youil have no one to blame but yourself .
thanks for that .
iil log that away .
now , for the final time ...
i order you to take me back to the palace .
looks to me like youre stuck out here ... because unless you change your mind , im not taking you back .
because unless you change your mind , im not taking you back .
me , me , me .
huh ?
what ?
i didnt do anything .
i didnt
somebodys throwing stuff .
you gonna build a fire or what ?
whats going on ?
hes never gonna change his mind .
how am i ever gonna get out of here ?
and so , it is with great sadness ... that we mourn the sudden departure of our beloved prince ... taken from us so tragically ... on the very eve of his 1 8th birthday .
poor little guy .
his legacy will live on in our hearts ...
he never had a chance . for all eternity .
well , he aint gettin any deader .
back to work .
kronk , darlin , i must admit you had me worried ... when you mixed up those poisons .
but now that kuzco is dead , all is forgiven .
ah .
oh , yeah , yeah .
hes hes dead , all right .
i mean , you cant get much deader than he than he is right now .
unless , of course , we killed him again .
i suppose .
hey , look , the royal dressers here .
kronk .
i should tell you right now im kind of hard to fit .
kronk .
i wear a 66 long and a 31 waist .
kuzco is dead , right ?
tell me kuzcos dead .
i need to hear these words .
do you need to hear all those words exactly ?
hes still alive ?
well , hes not as dead as we wouldve hoped .
kronk .
i just thought id give you the heads up in case kuzco ever came back .
he cant come back !
yeah .
that would be kind of awkward especially after that lovely eulogy .
you think ?
you and i are going out to find him .
if he talks , we are through !
now lets move .
dad , look out !
tipo , what is it ?
i had a dream that dad was tied to a log and was careening out of control ... down a raging river of death !
all right , all right , its okay .
shh .
it was awful !
its okay , its okay .
tipo , calm down .
it was just a dream .
your dads fine .
he just went back to see the emperor .
oh .
like you told him to , cause youre always right .
thats right .
well , in my dream , dad had to kiss a llama .
yeah , like that would ever happen .
it could .

so all of it was a lie ?
well , yeah .

please continue .
why me ?

hey , it doesnt always have to be about you .
this poor little guy has had it rough .
seems a talking llama gave him a hard time the other day .

i need two heartburns ... and a deep fried doorstop on table 1 2 !
okay , so iil admit this was a good idea .
when will you learn that all my ideas are good ones ?
thats funny , because i thought that you going into the jungle by yourself ... being chased by jaguars , lying to me to take you back to the palace were all really bad ideas .
oh , yeah .
anything sounds bad when you say it with that attitude .
hot and crispy pillbug for the happy couple .

their whole world revolves around me .

all you care about is your your stupid hilltop !
what ?
you dont care about me .
now , just get out of here .
go !
but but  go on !
get out of here !

oh , this entire mess is all your fault .
whatd i do ?
if you hadnt mixed up those poisons , kuzco would be dead now !
thereil be no more diversions until we track that llama down and kill him !
said i was sorry .
cant just let it go , not even on your birthday .
kuzco must be eliminated .
the empire will finally be rid of that useless slug .
well , you got a point .
nobody really seems to care that hes gone , do they ?
pacha !
pacha ?
so this is where you came in .
see , just like i said , im the victim here .
i didnt do anything , and they ruined my life and took everything i had .
hey , give it a rest up there , will you ?
what ?
im just telling them what happened .
who you kidding , pal ?
they saw the whole thing .
they know what happened .
well , yeah , but but  just leave me alone .
the peasant at the diner !
he didnt pay his check .
hes the peasant who i saw leaving the city who disappeared into the crowd with kuzco on the back of his cart .
he must have taken him back to his village , so if we find the village , we find him ... and if we find him , we find kuzco .
oh , yeah , its all comin together .
yzma !
what ?
this had better be good !
so there we were standing on the cliff , and the ground started to rumble .
and just as it started to go , he grabbed me before i fell .
do you believe that ?
you know , call me crazy for following this guy all the way out here ... but as much as he tries to deny it , i know theres some good in him .
besides , i couldnt just leave him out here all alone .
hes a lousy llama .
i mean , a really lousy llama .
hey , listen , pacha , you know ... what i said to you back at the diner , that that
i i didnt really
so , you tired of being a llama ?
yes !
okay , were just gonna stop at the house and get some supplies .
then weil be on our way , right ?
right .
hey there , pacha .
hey , you know , you just missed your relatives .
my relatives ?
yeah .
we just sent em up to your house .
what did they look like ?
well , you see , there was this big guy ... and this older woman who was , uh
how would you describe her ?
scary beyond all reason .
yeah , thats it .
so remind me again how youre related to pacha ?
why , im his third cousins brothers wifes step nieces great aunt .
twice removed .
uh huh .
isnt that right , kronk ?
ninety nine monkeys jumpinon the bed
one fell off and bumped his head
you know , i am so sorry that you had to come all this way ... but as i said to you before , you may recall , pacha is not here .
iil be sure and tell him you came by .
oh , would you , please ?
that would be just great .
oops .
silly me .
no , no .
allow me .
shes hiding something .
when i give the word , we search the house .
okay , but i still have 94 monkeys to go .
so while were waiting for paca  pacha .
yeah , i oh , yes .
um , perhaps we can have a tour of your lovely home .
you know , why dont you just come back when pacha gets home ?
im sure hed love to show you the
uh , excuse me , wont you ?
i think i left something in the oven .
this is my variation of double dutch .
on the signal , we switch places .
kronk , its time !

so we have to get back to the palace , find the lab and change him back .
hi there !
um , that was him .
whoops .

oh , dont worry .
they can handle themselves .
what do you mean , the door is stuck ?
try jiggling the handle .
there is no handle in here .
theres not ?
are you sure ?
all right , ive had enough of this .
tell us where the talking llama is , and weil burn your house to the ground .
uh , dont you mean " or " ?

that seems like a pretty crucial conjunction .
thats it , kronk !

by all accounts , it doesnt make sense .
oh , well , back to business .
okay , i admit it .
maybe i wasnt as nice as i should have been .
but , yzma , do you really want to kill me ?
just think of it as youre being let go ... that your lifes going in a different direction ... that your bodys part of a permanent outplacement .
hey , thats kind of like what he said to you when you got fired .
i know .
its called a cruel irony ...
like my dependence on you .

you d be the coolest dude in the nation
or the hippest cat in creation
but if you aint got friends then nothings worth the fuss

when everybody here can see
that a perfect world begins and ends
a perfect world begins and ends
a perfect world begins and ends with us
" my acorn is missing .
squeak , squeakin , squeak , squeakity .
" did you eat the acorn ?
squeaker , squeak , squeak , squeakin ?
" you owe me a new acorn .
squeak , squeak , squeak , squeak , squeaker
squeakin .
im so proud of you guys .
in the quiet time of evening
when the stars assume their patterns
and the day has made his journey
and we wondered just what happened
to the life we knew
before the world changed
when not a thing i had
was true
but you were kind to me
and you reminded me
that the world is not my playground
there are other things that matter
and what is simple needs protecting
or my illusions all would shatter
but you stayed
in my corner
the only world i know was upside down
and now the world and me
we know you carry me
you see the patterns in the big sky
those constellations look like you and i
just like the patterns in the big sky
we could be lost we could refuse to try
but we made it through
in the dark night
who would those lucky guys turn out to be
but that unusual blend
of my funny friend and me
im not as clever as i thought i was
im not the boy i used to be because
you show me somethin different
you show me somethinpure
i always seemed so certain but i was really never sure
but you stayed
and you called my name
when others would have walked out on a lousy game
and look who made it through
but your funny friend and me
you see the patterns in the big sky yeah , yeah , yeah
those constellations look like you and i
that tiny planet and the bigger guy
i dont know whether i should laugh or cry
just like the patterns in the big sky weil be together
weil be together till the end this time
you dont know you dont know
d ont know the answer or the reason why weil stick together
weil stick together till the day we die
if i had to do this all a second time
i wont complain or make a fuss
who would the angels send
but that unlikely blend
of those two funny friends
thats us
