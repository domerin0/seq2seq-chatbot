first time giving blood ?
yes .
they pay cash here .
and there' s no limit to how many times you give .
they even buy it in the jar .
jared nomak , we' re ready for you .
in the past 1 2 months , have you gotten a tattoo , or undergone any ear , skin , or body piercings ?
no .
where did you get that scar on your chin ?
childhood accident .
you say you don' t have any immediate next of kin ,
is that right ?
not that i' m in contact with .
nobody to call in case of an emergency ?
no one .
no family ?
i told you , no .
are you telling me i can' t be a donor ?
it depends .
we came up with some unusual results on your blood test .
what ?
how unusual ?
let me explain .
your blood has a very rare phenotype , one we haven' t encountered before .
what ?
what are you talking about ?
who are you ?
no .
sit down , please .
what is this ?
this is a good news bad news scenario , jared .
good news for us ... bad news ... ... for you .
forget what you think you know ... vampires exist .
my name is blade .
i was born half human , half vampire .
they call me " the daywalker .
i have all their strengths , none of their weaknesses .
except for the thirst .
20 years ago i met a man that changed that .
whistler .
he taught me how to hold the thirst at bay .
taught me the rules .
gave me the weapons to hunt with .
silver , garlic , sunlight .
two years ago he was attacked .
they took him , and turned him into the thing i hate most .
i should have finished him off .
now i' m hunting him .
i will find him .
and nothing will stand in my way .
daywalker' s here !
stop him !
where is he ?
hey !
no , no .
take me to him , and i' il consider you a loose end .
catch you later .
old man ... look at what they' ve done to you .
let' s go home .
lock up your daughters , boys and girls , the dark knight returns .
need a toke of the smokage , b ?
later .
cut the lights .
you found him .
you didn' t kill him .
give me a hand .
i got a bad feeling about this , b.
listen to his breathing .
he' s already dying .
he' s in pain .
why don' t you just put him out of his misery right now ?
they had him on stasis in a halfway house .
i' m giving him an accelerated retro viral detox .
like a heroin addict .
make him go cold turkey in one night .
shit ain' t going to work , man .
i say you kill the motherfucker right now .
get out .
if there' s anything left of you in there , whistler ,
listen up .
in the morning those blinds are going to open whether you' re cured ... or not .
hey , man , i didn' t mean to call him ...
listen to me , blade .
you' re going to have to finish me off .
no .
give me that damn gun .
now walk away .
stubborn son of a bitch .
how do you feel ?
like hammered shit .
how' d you find me ?
i started out in moscow .
then romania .
they kept moving you around .
how long was i gone ?
months ?
too long .
years .
they tortured me almost to death .
and then let me heal in a vat of blood so they could go at it again .
sorry sons of bitches could have at least fixed my goddamn leg while they were at it .
where' s my arc welder ?
what' s up ?
nice to meet you .
i heard a lot about you .
i' m josh .
you can call me " scud .
everybody does .
tell me something , skid ...
no , man , it' s " scud , " like " stud .
whatever .
what are you doing here ?
the pimpmobile ?
just a little aftermarket modification .
nitrous oxide and shit like that .
oh , yeah .
you gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping .
the whole package will crank that betty up , maybe 300 horsepower .
you' il burn the thing out before your next oil change .
where did you dig up this shitbird , anyway ?
what the fuck is your problem , poppy ?
my problem is i' ve been sucking blood clots for two years .
i get out to find some jerkoff fucking with my life' s work .
we jeopardized our whole operation to save your ass !
our operation ?
yeah .
our operation ?
i built this operation , you ass wipe !
motion sensors !
it' s on three , gentlemen .
human ?
body temperature , 50 .
i' d guess suckhead .
fried .
they' re using magnesium flares .
they' ve got your security system scoped out .
whoa , whoa , whoa .
i don' t trust you ...
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa .
cool outfit .
guard lights !
we represent the ruling body of the vampire nation .
they are offering you a truce .
they want to meet with you .
scud .
take off your mask .
my name is asad .
this is nyssa .
you have been our most feared enemy .
but now there' s something else loose on the streets .
something worse than you .
what' s so funny ?
they tell stories about blade as the bogeyman .
frankly , i' m disappointed .
you hear that , b ?
she' s disappointed .
he agreed to come along so easily .
come on , b , show her .
pretty please ?
semtex .
enough explosives to level a city block .
you still disappointed ?
the guards look human .
they' re probably familiars .
you sure about this ?
well , if i' m not ...
the true power of the vampire nation lies here .
father ?
blade , this is overlord eli damaskinos .
it has been said , " be proud of your enemy and enjoy his success .
in that regard , i should thank you .
for what ?
eliminating deacon frost .
you did us a favor .
karel kounen .
you' re human .
barely .
i' m a lawyer .
european health consortium .
as you may know , vampirism is ... a horrible virus , carried in the saliva of predators .
in 7 2 hours , it spreads through the human bloodstream , creating new parasitic organs .
like cancer .
cancer with a purpose .
unfortunately , viruses evolve , too .
we' ve encountered a new one .
we dubbed it the reaper strain .
and like any good pathogen , it appears to have found a carrier .
there ...
jared nomak .
born a vampire , but an anomaly like you .
unlike the rest of us , however , he feeds on not just humans , but vampires as well .
looks like he was doing me a favor .
you' re missing the point .
their vampire victims don' t die ... they turn .
they become carriers .
you' ve got to understand .
these things are like crack addicts .
they need to feed daily .
nomak' s been up for 7 2 hours .
by our estimates , there are already a dozen reapers .
there' il be hundreds before the week is out .
thousands within a matter of months .
do the math .
wait .
let me get this right .
you want me to hunt them ... for you ?
when they are finished with us , who do you think they' il turn on next ?
your precious humans .
not one of them will be left .
we spent two years training a small tactical unit ...
the bloodpack .
we want you to lead them .
two years ?
we' ve been training to hunt you .
so , b man , what do you think ?
sounds like a plan .
what do you really think ?
they' re going to fuck us the first chance they get .
so , we ain' t gonna do this , right ?
we' il play along for now .
they' il take us in deeper than we' ve ever been .
get a chance to see how their world really ticks .
i had enough of their world .
they' re just shitting bricks because they' re no longer top of the food chain .
damn , man , i' m really worried about him .
i know he' s your friend and all , but i think you should watch him .
nobody goes cold turkey from the thirst in just one night .
looking to get hooked up ?
maybe .
what do you have ?
no problem .
horse , hawaiian ice , whatever you need .
whatever i need .
i like that .
what if i need you ?
so , so sweet .
they are ready whenever you are , daywalker .
blade , meet the bloodpack .
lighthammer , verlaine ,
priest , snowman ,
chupa , and reinhardt .
hey , um ... me and the gang were wondering ...
what was that ?
can you blush ?
here we go .
oh , i get it .
i see now .
you' ve been training for two years to take me out .
and now , here i am .
ooh , so exciting , isn' t it ?
okay , here' s your chance .
come on .
what are you waiting for ?
here i am .
right here in front of you .
adolf here gets the first shot .
come on .
what are you looking at her for ?
you need permission ?
maybe you need a little bit of incentive .
okay , i can help with that .
what' s the matter ?
missed that ?
it' s okay , i can do it again .
come on .
what , do you need a manual ?
do it !
kill the bastard !
now you' ve got an explosive device stuck to the back of your head .
silver nitrate .
rigged to go off if anybody tampers with it .
i' il have the detonator with me .
and you ... if you so much as look at me wrong ...
from now on we work as a unit .
you' il be taking orders from me .
any questions ?
good .
you want to catch the hunter ?
you start with the prey .
we' il target all the night places where vampires congregate .
blood banks , safe houses .
the bigger the better .
so ... what' s first ?
the house of pain .
where' s the entrance ?
i don' t see any signs .
no vampire glyphs .
no , because of you , we' ve had to rethink our habits , tighten our security .
have a closer look .
nice . . 38 , . 45 and 9mm caliber .
all with foil capsules at the tip filled with silver nitrate , and garlic extract .
this hyper velocity stake gun spits out a silver stake at 6, 000 feet per second .
since you suckers don' t like sunlight , we' ve modified the gun' s entry light with a uv filter .
pop it open ... instant uv light .
filter' s on , no problem .
yo , b , check this out .
it' s got an pneumatic syringe delivery system .
the vials are filled with an anti coagulant called edta .
one punch with this , you' il blow your target up like a balloon .
the cartridge ejects .
automatic reload .
nice .
let' s go .
you won' t pass for one of us .
like i give a shit .
no , he' s right .
why don' t you post up on the roof over there ?
cover our backs .
so the bloodpack' s calling the shots now , huh ?
great .
better curb that dog of yours or we' il do it for you .
keep pushing , asshole .
i ya , i against i  flesh of my flesh and mind of my mind  two of a kind , but one won' t survive  my images reflect in the enemy' s eye  and his images reflect in mine the same time  i ya , i ya , i against i  flesh of my flesh and mind of my mind  two of a kind , but one won' t survive  survive , survive , survive .
we' re in .
you' re about to enter our world .
you will see things ... feeding .
just remember why you' re here .
i haven' t forgotten .
what exactly are we looking for in here ?
anything that looks suspicious .
you got to be kidding me .
scud , do you read me ?
scud , you reading me ?
reading you loud and clear .
the whole place is a safe house .
the windows are painted black , one access door .
200 , 300 suckheads in here .
that sounds cool .
hey , w , you got me ?
w ?
tell me something , how' s the weather up there ?
walkin ' on sunshine , toad boy .
look at them .
half of these bastards , they' re not even pure bloods .
i tell you what , why don' t we just fucking kill everyone ?
just to make sure .
god , it would be so easy .
he' s got you .
daywalker .
mother' s milk .
i say we got about half an hour till sunrise , cinderella .
hurry up .
i spotted one , but lost it .
be on the lookout .
fuck .
whistler , they' re on the roof .
i got them on the roof of my bus .
shhh .
nomak .
daywalker .
what am i to you ?
is the enemy of my enemy my friend ... or my enemy ?
we' re under attack !
there' s three of them .
probably more .
daylight .
silver don' t do jack shit .
don' t waste the bullets !
motherfucker .
you hear me , chupa ?
say , " cheese .
come on .
how about some daylight , motherfucker ?
fuck !
listen to me .
if you' re under attack , use your uv lights .
use your uv lights .
they can' t take the light .
priest ?
we' re not dying here .
come on .
priest is down .
daylight' s coming .
you' re on your own , blade .
you want me so bad , blade ?
here i am .
why kill me ?
you and i , we have the same enemy .
we want the same thing .
we need the same thing , blade .
what happened ?
why didn' t you tell me these things
were immune to silver and garlic ?
i didn' t know .
