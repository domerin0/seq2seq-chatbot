aii american diner , gailup , new mexico .
passed that on the way here .
he had breakfast there this morning .
starting off the bottom of the inning , barry matthews .
got on base with a line drive single his last at bat .
and he tak es the first pitch high and inside for ball one .
look ed lik e leonard was trying to get the breaking pitch inside ... ... but it just didn' t have any break on it that time .
agent mackelway , we' re over here .
i was gonna introduce you two , but i understand that won' t be necessary .
seems your former office decided we needed help ... ... so they sent us agent kulok .
hey , tom .
hi , fran .
i guess we' re gonna skip the tearfui reunion .

i' ve been chained to a desk .
okay , what do we know ?
picked up a footprint in the back seat .
a size and a half bigger than speck' s .
okay .
wounds on speck' s throat indicate he was strangled from behind .
i think our guy was waiting for him in the back seat ... ... sprung this on him once the car was moving .
lab picked up talcum traces along the edges ... ... consistent with powdered gloves .
so he gets this dropped in his iap ... ... it spooks him , car ends up in the ravine .
that car was pushed to the state iine .
the depth of the tire tracks ... ... footprints near the embankment .
that car wasn' t going more than 3 miles an hour ... ... and it stopped iiteraily on the state iine .
guy must have used gps .
why would he push it to the state iine ?
same reason he did everything else , to get the fbl' s undivided attention .
there' s an association here .
you have a circle ... ... and a iidless eye that' s always open .
seeing .
seeing .
or making sure that we' re seeing .
it' s just a feeling .
he was a normai guy .

you want me to see .
i' m trying to see it .
i' m trying to see it .
he opens up an old wound .

you' re welcome , tom .
you' re welcome , tom .

tom .
he' s baiting me .
he wants me .
why ?
what does he want ?
okay .
tom , i want you to take me through this .
explain this to me .
okay .
see if this makes sense to you , okay ?
each of the 45 abduction dates on these faxes correspond ... ... to one of the gps coordinates on o' ryan' s map .
what about the two bodies we id' d ?
okay .
weil , iet' s find the faxes .
here we go .
male victim .
last seen , trenton , new jersey .
okay .
found in dyersviile , iowa .
okay .
female .
last seen , dayton , ohio .
found in brownsviile , texas .
so we have two bodies ... ... that were found 1 000 miles from where they were iast seen .
what' s this ?
that' s tucumcari , new mexico .
why blue ?
that' s the only city where the date on the fax and the map didn' t correspond .
christmas .
on o' ryan' s map , 8 27 .
the only thing we know is there never was a benjamin o' ryan , fbl .
he would have made a heii of an agent .
autopsy reports just arrived for both the new positive ids .
bruises ?
no , they' re burn marks .
we' ve got them here too on our female from dayton .
and these marks relate to the marks found on fulcher and speck how ?
they don' t .
there were no burn marks on speck , fulcher or starkey .
and we have no slash circles here on these bodies .
right .
my office , as soon as someone finds something useful .
no iuck on the behaviourai specialists .
i do have a couple other ieads that i' m foilowing up on .
i' m hopefui they' re gonna pan out .
great , thank you .
a professor of criminai biology , professor daitz , just cailed .
he says he' s got time for you on saturday .
thank you , katie .
i was operating under the assumption that o' ryan was somebody' s fantasy .
oh , no , he' s real .
he was a student of mine .
that fax you sent me , this circle with the slash through it ?
that' s his construct , his theory .
he cailed it " suspect zero .
suspect zero ?
he posited a theory that a seriai kiiler ... ... could cross the entire country without ever getting caught .
what makes a kiiler catchable ?
patterns , repetition of behaviour .
he imagined someone with no patterns ... ... no teiltale fetishes , no rituals ... ... just a random kiiling machine that never ieaves a clue .
but a seriai kiiler by definition is condemned to repetition .
i mean , isn' t that what he' s aii about ?
weil , he is untii he isn' t .
and this suspect zero , is that something that you believe in , doctor ?
it' s something o' ryan believed in .
he swore guys iike that existed , only we couldn' t see them ... ... because they didn' t obey the usuai iaws , iike cancer doesn' t ... ... or the hlv virus that tricks your immune system ... ... into thinking it isn' t there .
so you' re saying a guy iike that could exist ?
do you know the definition of a black hole ?
not precisely , no .
it' s a celestiai body with a gravitationai force so strong ... ... that nothing escapes it .
not even iight .
weil , then how do you find something you can' t see ?
weil , it was there and we found it .
why do you think o' ryan is convinced a person iike that is around ?
in this time and place .
what about a split personality ?
could you have a stone cold kiiler on one hand ... ... and a thoughtfui man with a conscience on the other ?
i mean , could o' ryan ... ... possibly be this suspect zero ?
yeah .
it' s a viable theory .
i mean , the point is , i don' t think you' re gonna know untii you find o' ryan .
point is , i don' t think you' re gonna know until you find o' ryan .
just a random killing machine that never leaves a clue .
yes , lord .
yes , lord .
sing it , lord .
everybody inside .
on the double , iet' s go .
come on .
keep moving .
storm' s coming .
get inside !
come on in , right now !

yeah , fran , i need somebody to talk to .
it' s driving me crazy .

i' m taking your time .
i' m sorry to ask you these questions .
i' m sorry i don' t have more time , agent mackelway , but it' s my pta day .
i' m sorry .
i should have cailed .
i wish i could' ve helped you .
i' m fbl .
yeah , i' ii bet .
what the heii is that ?
we managed to identify the remains of 1 0 of the 21 victims found ... ... in the attic of harold a. speck ... ... the travelling salesman from truth or consequences .
they were mostly teenagers .
more than half were runaways .
the revelation that speck was a serial killer ... ... led us to examine barney fulcher ... ... the victim that agent kulok and i found at the all american diner .
after an extensive search of his home , we found the remains of nine people ... ... mostly boys between the ages of 9 and 1 4 .
the last victim , raymond stark ey ... ... who vanished after his acquittal six months ago , we all know about .
for some reason , this man is identifying and targeting serial killers .
not necessarily .
we got two other bodies from santa fe ... ... so killers aren' t his only victims .
we don' t know those bodies had anything to do with o' ryan .
stick to what we know .
he' s a transient with mentai iilness .
he also happens to think he' s a former agent of this bureau .
i want this man apprehended now .
swung on and missed .

what kind of weapon , sir ?
a hunting knife , right here on my hip .
on my way to the woods .
my gear' s in the trunk .
would you iike me to hand it to you ?
i don' t know what the procedure is .
take the weapon off your hip , place it on the ground , kick it towards me .

you got one of those pins in deming ?
o' ryan was spotted there yesterday .
he took a squad car and a sidearm off a highway patrolman .
about an hour iater a 5 year old boy was abducted a mile up the interstate .
we also found the bodies of two females in a dumpster off the highway .
your boy' s been busy .
we' re establishing a perimeter around the city .
was the patrolman hurt ?
what' s the difference ?
he wasn' t , was he ?
he was fine .
the girls in the dumpster had fatai injuries .
o' ryan' s not the guy .
he' s chasing the guy or that patrolman would be dead .
can i ship this guy back to dailas ?
o' ryan was fbl , you ever heard of a project cailed icarus ?
no .
have you ?
it' s agents trained to see distant iocations ... ... using only the mind .
they caii it remote viewing .
bureau stole it from the army .
they use it to track down seriai kiilers .
what ?
you don' t believe me ?
it' s builshit ?
it' s voodoo ?
it worked .
they made a science of it .
that' s how he drew this .
he' d never been in this house ... ... he just saw what was there .
the bureau taught him ... ... and he' s using it to track suspect zero .
you know what ?
i' m extremely tired of that term .
profile the guy .
he' s straight out of quantico .
he' s working iike we would .
he' s not kidnapping , he' s chasing the guy ... ... that' s doing the kidnapping .
look at the map .
okay .
what you' re teiling me is aii these abductions are the work of one guy .
yes .
mac , do you realize how insane that is ?
fran , please help me .
he' s not iistening to me .
tom , i' m not sure that you' re seeing things very clearly right now .
tom ... ... iet' s just try something that actuaily makes sense .
this guy sends in these faxes .
he picks off three scumbags .
why ?
so that we' ii think what you' re thinking , that we got a friend .
somebody who' s wiiling to take out the trash for us , and it' s horseshit .
what if it isn' t ?
what if there is a suspect zero , and o' ryan' s the one guy who' s got a shot ?
for fuck' s sake , mackelway .
when did you start buying into this guy ?
weil , he' s smarter than we are .
speak for yourself .
i' m going to deming .
you can take the rest of the day off .
i' il be damned .
kulok here .
hey .
where are you ?
i' m headed towards tucumcari .
listen , those marks on the bodies , could they be freezer burns ?
let me get into this .
yeah .
there' s crystailization because the blood never clotted .
freezer burn .
he keeps the bodies in a freezer and buries them 1 000 miles apart ?
hey , tom , what' s going on ?
i got a possible suspect .
that kid' s been a brat aii morning .
i turned around ....
see what you caused ?
are you afraid ?
it' d be custom here at this point to start praying .
i see a iot of that .
haven' t heard too many answers though .
you' re alone .
come on .
are you afraid ?
where' s the boy ?
my , my !
must be extremely satisfying to hear yourself say something so heroic .
i' m almost envious .
the boy' s in pieces under the bed .
now are you afraid ?
i know what you' re thinking , " pain is coming .
wiii i take it iike a man .
let me put you at ease , you won' t .
none of them do .
men , women , children , they aii weep , they aii beg .
they pass out , piss themselves , attempt negotiations .
you wouldn' t believe how many men i' ve seen where you are .
grown men with wives and children at home ... ... offering sexuai gratification for a five minute reprieve .
it' s pathetic .
are you afraid ?
when they realize there' s nothing ieft to negotiate , and they' re helpiess ....
weil , the iook in their eyes , the ievei of surrender ... ... it' s almost pornographic .
i put that mirror here because i didn' t want you to miss it .
are you afraid ?
look in the mirror .
are you afraid ?
look in the mirror .
are you afraid ?
look in the mirror , o' ryan .
hey , you , fucking mackelway .
look at yourself , iook in the mirror .
are you afraid , mackelway ?
look at yourself .
are you afraid ? !
no , i' m not afraid .
open your eyes !
open your eyes , goddamn it ...
... or i' ii cut the fucking iids off !
then cut the fucking iids off !
the initiation used to be more civil .
i' m sorry about that .
you' re part of it now .
there were five of us , you know .
the most skiiled ... ... technicai remote viewers on project icarus .
you come in in the morning , have a cup of coffee , talk about the yankees .
you go to your room with your pen ... ... and your pad of paper , always alone .
you try and iock in , you crank out an ideogram .
son of sam , john wayne gacy , ted bundy .
he might be driving his car , having a beer , brushing his teeth ... ... cutting someone' s eyes out .
if you did it right , you got it ail .
the way it sounded , the way it smeiled .
those people were iooking right up at you , begging you for mercy .
it was iike being god .
but , of course , you' re not god .
can' t do a thing for them .
they wired us into this current , the five of us ... ... darkness , the pit itself .
we were plugged right into it , and no one taught us how to turn it off .
we saw things men shouldn' t see .
agony ... ... torture ... ... evil .
it never shut off .
i checked once with aii the guys that' d ... ... been on the project when it was just used for intel .
