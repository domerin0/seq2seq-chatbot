when i was born my parents felt they had won the lottery .
but they didn' t know me yet .
they weren' t as pleased later on .
especially not dad .
he likes me , but i think he' d rather have a more normal boy .
the kind that plays soccer instead of the piano .
then he might not have left , and mom wouldn' t be so lonely .
martin !
mom says dad' s taking a time out .
it might be cold up north .
i guess he' s trying to figure out what to do about us .
i could stay home ...
or maybe dad could come here , so you could see him too .
no ...
sometimes i wish i was someone else , someone more outspoken .
i' m julia .
from day one l knew i had a lousy deal .
they weren' t were wild about me either , though mom pretended to be .
a kaleidoscope !
then she met this new guy , who had a daughter , so she didn' t need me .
but who cares , i don' t need her either .
julia !
no way i' m going to visit that bitch !
this weekend is special for your mother ... and that peter guy .
even though things were rough last christmas , you can' t just give up .
and that daughter of his , what' s her name ... ?
my , that' s it .
you' il practically be sisters .
i don' t want to have a sister !
i want to have a dog !
that' s nasty ...
i don' t like traveling but until dad' s made his mind up , what can i do ?
go figure ...
mom gets herself a new family but i get passed around like some kind of parcel !
i should go get myself a whole new family too .
a whole new family ...
here , take this mobile phone .
how can parents let their kids use mobile phones and fry their brains ?
it' s not like i enjoy sending my only child off to a strange man' s house .
i do it for you , so you can interact with both your parents even if one is ... absent .
will you tape robert wells tonight ?
sure .
but doesn' t your dad have a tv set too ?
it' s time to go !
i really don' t want to do this .
have a good time ...
i' m not going , and that' s final .
let go !
can' t you come along ?
you know i can' t .
i' il see you soon , honey .
here we are .
you' re martin , right ?
i' il come and get you when it' s time to board the plane .
thank you ...
why did you say thank you ?
you thanked that lady .
it' s their job to take care of us .
you don' t need to thank them .
where are you going ?
up north , to see my dad .
he lives close to the norwegian border .
what about you ?
i' m going south , to see my mom .
do you go there a lot ?
i' ve only been there once since ... ... since she ... moved out .
she' s got a new boyfriend .
what about you ?
my mother' s not ready for a new relationship .
i meant , how often do you visit your dad ?
every four weeks and every other holiday , only ...
you don' t want to .
i wish dad would come back home .
so mom wouldn' t be sad all the time .
want one ?
no , i' m a vegetarian .
i don' t eat dead animals .
got any money ?
160 kronor .
and ten norwegian kronor .
why do norwegians water flag poles ?
don' t know .
they want the bulb on top to bloom .
want to go buy something ?
i' m not supposed to go anywhere .
do you have a best friend ?
nah , that' s just silly .
i agree .
check it out !
come on in !
that' s london .
robert wells played there , at the royal albert hall .
who ?
robert wells .
some day i' m going to play there too .
maybe we' re twins .
we don' t have the same parents .
we' re cosmic twins .
what' s that ?
pieces of the same whole , like broken bits of glass that fit together .
broken bits of glass ?
just something i heard somewhere .
let me try these ...
wow , what a trip ...
give them back ...
try this on .
want to trade places ?
if we trade places we get out of seeing our parents .
martin , where did you go off to ?
your flight' s ready for take off , we don' t wait for little kids you know .
excuse me ...
could you help me out ?
julia , it' s time to go .
julia ?
welcome aboard .
hurry up , honey .
this isn' t the right plane , i' m going to see my dad .
i' m supposed to go to norrland .
may we have your attention please as we demonstrate our safety procedures .
this information is also available in the folder in your seat pocket .
emergency exits are located in the back , over the wings , and up front .
a light strip along the floor will direct you to the way out .
please check which exit is the closest to your seat .
come on , martin !
how about some adventure ?
i don' t know ...
is it true that you' re a wimp ?
well , are you a wimp ?
no .
then go for it !
discover new frontiers .
show people what you' re made of !
good , it' s about time you showed some spunk .
let' s hear it for martin !
we would like to remind you that smoking is prohibited .
and we' d like to wish you a pleasant trip .
where could that dad of yours be ?
i don' t know .
i hope your mother told your dad when your flight would be in .
what' s his phone number ?
i don' t know .
you don' t know ?
i' ve forgotten it .
is that your dad ?
well ?
martin !
i' m so sorry ...
thank you , i apologize for the delay .
i was busy breeding .
bye .
look at you ...
does robert wells have a new hairdresser ?
wow , muscles ...
have you been working out ?
how' s school ?
fine .
and your classmates ?
everything' s fine .
great .
good .
sverker will be surprised .
he thinks all you do is sit still and play the piano .
i can' t sit still , and i don' t play the piano either .
have you quit playing ?
not really ...
but i' m trying to cut back .
i see ...
but you will play for us at the party , won' t you ?
gran' s birthday party .
oh , that party ...
gran' s really looking forward to it .
as you can see , it' s still a bit cold up here .
but down south in malm they' re already wearing swim trunks .
julia !
kicki wanted me to pick you up .
i know you' re a tough cookie ... ... but you' il find i' m a worthy opponent .
good , then we won' t have a repeat of the christmas incident .
you' ve changed .
yeah , my hair is nicer .
what do your friends say ?
tell me .
they don' t say much ...
your stepfather is a world famous gladiator , of course you' ve bragged about it .
be like pollux : big , bad and beautiful !
the gladiators , on tv .
don' t you watch the show ?
no , mom ...
mom doesn' t like shows like that .
are you nuts ?
she yells her head off cheering .
you' il see , tonight .
listen , don' t give my a hard time .
get in the back .
hi ...
my !
hop in .
i don' t usually sit in the front seat .
funny ...
i' m so glad you' re here .
i' ve missed you like crazy .
you have ?
of course i have .
pop upstairs and say hi to your gran , i' il start cooking dinner .
i' il take your jacket .
martin ... is that nail polish ?
isn' t it neat ?
it might not go down well here ...
i' il take it off if you want me to .
long hair is one thing ...
but some folks might think nail polish is strange .
all the guys wear nail polish in stockholm .
people would think it was strange if you didn' t .
i see ...
i don' t want you to get in trouble .
why would l ?
martin , is that you ?
wait here in the car .
knock it off .
what ?
you are so busted .
it wasn' t my idea ...
it' s not my fault your parents got divorced .
i know that .
you do ?
you told me you' d still have a mom if it wasn' t for me .
did i say that ?
and you said you' d cut my hair off when i was asleep .
oh ... that was a rotten thing to say .
you should have seen the way the shop girls stared at me .
their eyes were like this .
excuse me !
i knew it .
right , do you have a pen ?
i can' t sign autographs without a pen .
you forgot your change .
oh ...
thanks .
people are always asking dad for his autograph .
and he came to my school and showed everyone his muscles .
why ?
everyone wanted to see them .
hi ...
you' ve changed .
thanks .
come on in .
what do you think ?
pretty .
but the shoes are a pain , i can barely walk in them .
they set off your legs , kicki .
and no one' s got legs like yours !
go and unpack , you can try on your dresses later .
stay out of my room !
sorry , i' il go to my room ...
i need to freshen up .
flying leaves you all grimy .
those pigs are the cutest !
i wish i could have one as a pet .
what' s that ?
a cream sauce .
it' s very rich , so don' t tell your mom i' m feeding you stuff like that .
about your mom ...
does anyone come around to see her ?
in the evenings ...
guys that come to date ...
she' s not ready for a new relationship .
i' m sorry , i shouldn' t have asked you that .
but that' s just what she says .
some people meet someone when they walk into a 7 eleven store .
has your mom ... ?
no , not her .
other people .
oh ...
could you tell gran that dinner' s ready ?
gran ...
dinner' s ready .
who are you ?
where' s martin ?
are you coming ?
who is this little girl , torkel ?
mother ....
it' s martin .
that is not martin .
stop it , mother .
dinner' s ready , come down when you' re ready .
i don' t eat meat .
since when ?
since ...
thursday .
i told you it' s not martin .
stop it , mother .
may i come in ?
have you seen ... the room ?
we weren' t sure ...
after what happened at christmas we weren' t sure you' d be here much , and peter needed some space .
so we packed away your things .
but they' re in the boxes .
we really want to see you , and you do have a room at your dad' s place .
is his computer still in there ?
you should tell him to throw it out .
your room isn' t a junkyard , you tell him i said that .
take your time and unpack your things .
you can try your dress on later .
right ...
i' m just going to work out a little .
your mother is lucky in love , that' s for sure .
let' s speed things up ...
no ... that was a little too fast .
set it for ten .
aren' t they gorgeous ?
this one' s yours , julia .
this is what we' il look like .
i don' t usually wear dresses .
i know ...
that' s why i was so happy that you agreed to wear one on this special and wonderful day .
what' s this ?
strange ...
you seem to have gotten smaller .
doesn' t your dad feed you ?
sure , he serves lots of pork .
you don' t eat meat .
that' s right , i forgot that she ... ... that i' m a vegrarian .
maybe i should wear something else ?
no , i can fix it .
i really appreciate that you' ve started combing your hair again .
here they come , martin .
who ?
hello , torkel .
good to see you .
how was the trip ?
a bloody nightmare !
where' s ma ?
i' m worried about her .
she didn' t recognize martin .
she didn' t ?
hi there , you poor little thing .
mother' s resting .
well if it isn' t martin , the piano mistress .
are they still mean to you at school ?
i' ve got even more super powers .
i can move myself with my mind .
it' s true , i' il show you later .
joakim could teach those stockholmers a thing or two .
he never says no to a fight .
hello , joakim .
show uncle torkel how good you are .
up with the left ...
come on , show him .
not bad .
he' s good .
what are you doing with that ?
are you going to sleep in here ?
got something against it ?
it sounds like fun .
you like norwegian jokes ?
you know , the kind that poke fun at norwegians .
i know loads .
that' s news to me .
want to hear one ?
know why jesus wasn' t born in norway ?
they couldn' t find three wise men .
want to hear another one ?
know any dirty jokes ?
do you know the difference between a mailbox and a horse' s ass ?
then we can' t send you to mail letters .
you' ve grown up .
you think so ?
you used to be like a girl .
excuse me , is it all right if i turn on the tv ?
go ahead .
oh my god , it' s eight !
peter !
my !
are you coming ?
welcome to the gladiators !
featuring pollux !
what a cool dude !
pollux he' s big , bad and beautiful !
he really cleaned up last week ...
what am i doing here ?
i don' t want to be here .
why don' t you do something about it ?
aren' t you on tv ?
take charge of your life , martin .
it' s not easy .
sometimes you have to do hard stuff .
follow your heart , martin .
i don' t know what that means , or what to listen for .
well , you can hear me .
are you the voice of my heart ?
now you see me , but before you know it , i will be transported ...
... without moving a muscle .
fat chance !
are you still here ?
how are you , ma ?
hello .
hello ...
martin ... it' s martin !
it' s for me ...
i have this friend in malm called martin .
are you out of your mind ?
you can' t call me here .
i' ve decided to follow my heart and tell the truth .
what ?
speak up , closer to the phone .
these people are nuts and they' re making me wear a dress .
say no , i would .
then come here and say it .
i' m not staying .
we agreed to trade places .
i didn' t agree .
you said you didn' t want to go .
i said i wanted my dad to come home .
i might be able to help you .
torkel' s been asking if your mother is seeing someone .
that means he' s jealous .
he might be thinking about coming home .
let' s wait until tomorrow and i' il find out what he' s up to .
i don' t want to spend the night here !
how are you ever going to reach london if you can' t even go to malm ?
by the way , your cousin' s cute .
jonathan ?
oh no , not joakim ...
if he tries to take grandpa' s moped again , you' ve got to stop him .
okay , it' s your turn .
i didn' t know you could drive .
you don' t know me very well .
want to go into town and check out the chicks ?
don' t you know what chicks are ?
or would you rather practice piano ?
then hop on .
hold on .
maybe there aren' t any chicks around here .
look !
now don' t make a fool of yourself .
hi there .
don' t you recognize us ?
unfortunately , we do .
is it all right if i pet your dog ?
go ahead .
what' s his name ?
rhonda , she' s a girl .
it' s hard to tell the difference .
i know .
what' s up ?
want to have a ride ?
on that ?
is it fun to have a dog ?
not if you have to walk it a lot .
we could come along .
or we could walk rhonda .
wait !
what a cutie !
well , i think you' re cute .
really cute .
are you going to bed ?
yeah .
me too .
oh ...
you' re so different .
compared to what you were like last christmas .
i never thought you' d wear a dress .
neither did i.
you looked nice in it .
really ?
it was a little big , though .
yeah ...
you know what ?
as of tomorrow , we' il be family .
is that good or bad ?
i just wanted to say goodnight .
the kaleidoscope ...
i thought you threw it away ?
why did you say you threw it away ?
i don' t know .
funny how broken bits of glass can be so pretty ...
and if two pieces of glass fit together ...
then maybe they' re ...
... cosmic twins !
you still remember that nonsense , do you ?
it' s not nonsense , it' s true !
julia ...
my julia .
i love you so much .
good night .
good night .
listen ... about the dress ...
i know you don' t really like dresses .
it' s actually kind of pretty .
will you wear it ?
29 ...
and one for ma ... ... and one for pa .
good morning .
two more , and that' s it .
it' s awful , but i haven' t been able to sleep .
i' m so darned nervous .
but a tough cookie like you wouldn' t understand that .
i would too ...
i know i shouldn' t worry .
but i have this funny feeling something will go wrong .
gran says that a troubled soul is a living soul .
right ...
want to try some ?
it' s an energy drink .
sometimes you need a boost ...
want to give it a go ?
no ...
come on , girlie .
give it a whirl .
you sit there and put your feet up there .
whoops , that was too much ...
i' il lose a couple more .
good .
good job , one more ...
come on !
come meet ...
rosa ... ... and linda .
we work together at salon rosalinda !
on monday they leave for the barrier reef , their honeymoon .
that' s in australia , you know .
won' t that be fun ?
they' re not taking me .
don' t you know what grown ups do on a honeymoon ?
they mess around !
no peeking !
i need to take a leak .
go outside , this place is a ladies ' room only today .
but it' s my regular week to be with mom anyway .
actually , this week was mom' s week , only they switched .
it makes you wonder if they would do the same for us , move around , i mean .
i think my mother would like to have me all the time .
now it' s your turn , girls .
exciting , isn' t it ?
that your mom is getting married ?
i don' t think so , i think she misses dad too much .
oh ...
has she told you that ?
no , mom always says everything' s fine even when it isn' t .
let' s see what we can do ...
oh , not ...
martin' s wearing girlie underwear !
check it out !
yuck !
i knew there was something wrong with him !
dad !
could i do my vanishing trick at the party ?
what a nut you are .
something' s wrong with martin .
to say the least ...
if my son wore floral panties , i' d send him to military school .
he' d have no say in the matter , and how fair would that be ?
well if it isn' t the piano mistress .
i' m not a mistress ...
that' s not what i hear .
i hear you' re pretty girlie girlie .
what the hell are you doing ?
let' s go fix dinner , martin .
does it hurt ?
of course not ...
i dislike violence , but it was about time someone taught him a lesson .
why haven' t you done it ?
he' s always been like that .
listen , there' s something i' ve got to tell you .
you see , i' m going to move out at the end of the month .
was that why you asked about mom ?
i want her to be okay with this .
i' m sure she' il be glad .
i want you to be glad too .
see ...
i' ve met someone i like .
dinner , coming up !
her name is eva karin ...
martin !
i should have told you ...
it' s disgusting !
all you think of is your own pleasure even if means death !
does it seem that bad to you ?
i never wanted to hurt anyone ...
what do you use for brains ? !
i want you to be okay with this , that' s the most important thing .
i' il never do something like this again without talking to you first .
promise ?
i promise .
what about the dinner ?
it' s too late to make any changes at this point , but if you give me the chance
i' il tell eva karin how you feel .
eva karin ?
what about the pigs ?
the pigs ?
what are you doing here in the dark ?
the guests are arriving .
don' t be afraid , he' s promised to talk to me beforehand .
and i' il never , ever let you die !
welcome !
please have a drink .
everyone at twilight cottage wishes you a happy birthday !
for me ?
evert and anna mrta chipped in .
but not ke and mrs. lsaksson .
you can have two sets of china .
is my hearing aid ringing ?
this is martin and eva karin .
all the grandchildren are here .
it would have been nice if martin were here .
he promised to play for us .
martin will play for you .
i can assure you he will .
let' s go inside .
is it hard to walk with those sticks ?
yes , it' s very difficult .
i can carry them for you , i' m really strong !
we will be hearing ...
what ?
i think i' il improvise .
the boy' s improved .
don' t waste our time ...
he might not feel like playing .
considering ...
this family loves music .
right ?
we love music .
i wish i could play .
so , go ahead .
do this .
and you do this .
any more music lovers ?
how is everything ?
your dad is moving back in .
really ?
at the end of the month .
thanks for helping me out .
you' re helping me .
go , you' re free !
what are you , stupid ?
you can' t trust a guy like that !
save yourselves , run !
all right ...
if you' d rather be christmas dinner , suit yourselves !
i certainly do ...
i do ...
i do .
i do .
oh , kicki !
i don' t have the words ...
your waist is like a wasp .
your hair is like a wedding cake .
and those legs ... ... are divine !
you look good too .
so do you .
could you pull over ?
i need to pee .
why didn' t you go before we left ?
well she didn' t , so stop the car .
i don' t get it , she spent all day in the ladies ' room , and all ...
i' ve got to go too .
again ?
see ...
wait , julia ... ... or whatever your name is , wait !
where is julia ?
in renvattnet .
up north , by the norwegian border .
everything fine ?
yeah .
need to make a call ?
you can borrow my phone .
but only if you look after rhonda for a while .
the bride' s a knock out .
welcome to the church .
i' m peter .
aren' t you ... ?
you' re pollux , right ?
i always root for you .
thank you .
come along , kids .
how are you doing ?
i' m fine .
you know ...
a troubled soul is a living soul .
i guess we won' t be related after all .
is that good or bad ?
what do you think ?
let' s go upstairs to the gallery .
hello !
come here .
look at all those people .
i don' t see well at a distance .
i usually wear glasses .
i' il help you out .
here come our neighbors .
dad says they' re filthy rich .
and those guys work with dad .
rosa and linda are over there .
hello !
forget everything i told you , he' s just like the rest .
what do you mean ?
he' s met someone !
but what about mom ?
all he cares about is himself .
just like my mom , who doesn' t care about me or anyone else .
that' s not true , kicki loves you .
when did she say that ?
yesterday .
she said it to you .
yes ...
then it' s you she loves .
she thought i was you .
but it wasn' t me .
this just isn' t working out !
i' ve looked all over for you .
how long were you on the phone ?
i' il pay for it .
that' s all right , he took care of rhonda for me .
bye , martin !
you can watch rhonda anytime .
what did she say ?
she told me ... that things weren' t the way i thought they were .
dad' s met someone .
so ?
you didn' t expect him to move back in with your mom , did you ?
are you going to tell kicki ?
i have to .
it' s your call , just listen to your heart .
robert ... ?
robert wells .
how could you be so careless ?
you know it' s a rare antique .
i thought it was a moped .
rare means valuable and special ...
just like you .
i wish you would tell me what' s wrong .
then maybe we could start trusting each other again .
where' s my old martin ?
doesn' t that look scrumptious !
no , i think it looks tasty .
i' m not martin .
i already know that .
i' m julia .
it' s time .
you look great .
are you ready , my ?
go get julia .
hurry up .
give me a kiss .
come on .
come on , julia .
hurry up .
we make our entrance when the bells stop ringing .
what' s the matter ?
i have to talk to you , kicki .
it' s not a good time .
right now .
let go of me ...
what is it , julia ?
i' m not julia .
that' s not funny !
she' s got cold feet , she' s going back to her ex .
i can sense it .
no , kicki would never do that .
i know it' s hard to understand ...
but it' s like those pieces of glass in a kaleidoscope , two identical pieces lock into place .
that' s impossible .
that' s what happened .
but ...
why ?
she traded me and my dad for a new guy and a new kid .
a kid with pretty hair .
your hair is pretty too , but it wouldn' t hurt to comb it .
may l ?
mom said she wanted to live on her own .
but then she met this new guy right away at a 7 eleven store .
he has a daughter , so she doesn' t need me anymore .
and now they' re getting married .
i told you so .
peter " pollux " bergvall ... ... and kristina linnea lindstrm .
we are gathered here to bless this union ...
i' m sorry ...
i can' t go through with this .
not without julia .
well ?
what are you doing ?
what' s your dad' s number ?
what' s going on ?
peter , please .
does this have anything to do with anders ?
what' s this , peas ?
don' t you want to be big and strong ?
peas are good for you .
is pig farming profitable ?
how are you doing ?
i' m worried about martin .
if he was my son , i' d send ...
that' s it , i' ve had enough !
i' m sick and tired of being bullied by you all my life !
i' il have you know that i' m proud of martin just the way he is !
i was going to say i' d send him to a music academy .
could you put julia on ?
who is this ?
put julia on !
what are you talking about ?
let my daughter go !
i don' t have your daughter .
dad , it' s me , martin .
i' m sorry .
but ...
it' s all my fault .
no , it isn' t , martin .
and it' s not julia' s fault either .
it' s all my fault .
but i' ve realized one thing ...
you can' t run away from who you are .
you taught me that , martin .
we might as well get used to it .
goodbye .
it was fun , wasn' t it , ma ?
goodbye , bodil .
take care .
i was wondering ...
would you like to be my girlfriend ?
you wouldn' t even talk to me a few hours ago .
now you' re a girl .
i' m still the same person .
bye , joakim .
look at me !
where did you come from ?
bye , jonathan .
i' ve booked the first flight out to stockholm tomorrow , and so have they .
do you think she' il want to see me ?
i can assure you she will .
how about it , toots ?
want to go fishing ?
you' re not like other guys .
that' s what they tell me .
you' re so brave .
i' m not exactly a gladiator .
no , but you speak your mind .
you' re brave for real .
how did it go , martin ?
did you have an adventure ?
good .
here ...
hi , dad .
hi , martin .
i' m so happy ...
me too .
boy , you' ve changed !
don' t say that .
no , you haven' t changed a bit .
so you' re a newlywed , i guess .
no ...
i couldn' t go through with it .
not without julia .
so it' s up to me ?
yeah ...
if i do it , what' s in it for me ?
you can ...
you can have a ...
a dog ?
don' t worry , dad , i don' t need a dog , but then again ...
come , let' s play together .
you' re doing fine without me .
please , just for the heck of it ?
so , you' re going to renvattnet .
and then to malm .
i' il be back .
uh ...
thanks .
