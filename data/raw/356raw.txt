mr stamper ?
phase 2 is underway .
i have the videotape .
i haven' t seen it , but i' m told it' s excellent .
there were 17 survivors for your headlines .
good work , stamper .
thank you .
don' t mention it .
keep it in a safe place .
gentlemen and ladies , hold the presses .
this just in .
by a curious quirk of fate , we have the perfect story with which to launch our satellite news network tonight .
a small crisis is brewing in the south china seas .
i want full newspaper coverage .
i want magazine stories , books , films , tv , radio !
i want us on air 24 hours a day !
this is our moment !
and a billion people around this planet will watch it , hear it and read about it from the carver media group .
there' s no news ...
like bad news .
am pleased with your progress , mr bond .
i' ve always enjoyed studying a new tongue , professor .
one might say you have a natural ability .
but practice makes perfect .
hmm .
who' s that ?
how do you say " i' m not here " in danish ?
ignore it .
words they don' t have in their vocabulary .
bond here .
go to a secure line , 007 .
going to scrambler , channel ... 4 .
it was in international waters .
we can' t be certain .
james , where are you ?
oh , moneypenny .
um ... i' m just up here at oxford , brushing up on a little danish .
little ?
you' il have to kiss off your lesson , james .
we' ve got a situation here .
we' re sending the fleet to china .
uh huh .
i' il be there in , uh ... in an hour .
30 minutes .
goodbye , my sweet .
you always were a cunning linguist , james .
don' t ask .
don' t tell .
we know exactly where that ship was !
the global positioning satellites do not lie !
our singapore station picked up a mysterious gps signal .
it could have sent that ship off course .
i have a missing frigate ...
i' m aware of that !
all you want to do ...
is prevent world war ill !
i don' t think sending an armada is the way to do it .
where did this signal come from ?
we' re still investigating .
investigating !
m , sometimes i don' t think you have the balls for this job .
at least i don' t have to think with them all the time .
that' s enough .
where do we stand ?
it was an unprovoked attack on a ship in international waters .
we send in the fleet and prepare for full retaliation .
moderation .
we investigate rather than send the entire british navy within 10 minutes of the world' s largest air force .
when will our ships get there ?
48 hours , sir .
christ !
the press are already screaming for blood .
we don' t want to escalate the situation .
i' m afraid it may be too late .
17 british sailors murdered " ?
according to vietnamese officials , the victims were riddled with ammunition used by the chinese air force .
did you leak this ?
no !
it' s the first i' ve heard of it .
well , this settles it .
we send in the fleet .
m , you have 48 hours to investigate .
there is one strange thing .
the vietnamese only found our sailors three hours ago .
how' d they get the paper out so fast ?
tomorrow " knew before the vietnamese government did .
how much do you know about elliot carver , 007 ?
world wide media baron , able to topple governments .
carver owns that newspaper " tomorrow " .
that mysterious signal came from one of carver' s satellites .
the pm would have my head if he knew you were investigating him .
i' m sending you to hamburg .
there' s a party tonight at carver' s media centre .
they' ve launched a new satellite .
he can now reach every human being on earth .
except the chinese , who' ve refused broadcast rights .
james , your ticket , cover story and car reservation .
sign here , please .
you had a relationship with carver' s wife , paris .
that was a long time ago , m , before she married .
i didn' t realise it was public knowledge .
queen and country , james .
find out whether carver sent that ship off course and why .
use your relationship with mrs carver .
i doubt if she' il remember me .
remind her .
then pump her for information .
you just have to decide how much pumping is needed , james .
if only that were true of you and i , moneypenny .
passengers are asked not to leave baggage unattended .
if you just sign here , mr bond .
it' s the insurance damage waiver for your beautiful new car .
will you need collision coverage ?
yes .
fire ?
probably .
property destruction ?
definitely .
personal injury ?
i hope not , but accidents happen .
they frequently do with you .
well , that takes care of the normal wear and tear .
do i need any other protection ?
only from me , 007 , unless you bring that car back in pristine order .
shall we ?
shall we ?
your new bmw 750 .
all the usual refinements machine guns , rockets and a gps tracking system .
welcome .
please fasten seat belt and obey all instructions .
thought you' d pay more attention to a female .
i think we' ve met .
i am not interested in your sordid escapades .
your new telephone .
talk here , listen here .
so that' s what i' ve been doing wrong .
look .
it also includes a fingerprint scanner and a 20, 000 volt security system
and this i' m particularly proud of the remote control for your car .
tap twice .
1 , 2 .
draw your finger very slowly across the pad to drive the car .
it' s difficult to drive , but with practice ...
let' s see how she responds to my touch .
think we understand each other .
grow up , 007 .
engine running .
please shut door .
engine running .
please shut door .
don' t let her push you around .
there' s absolutely no truth in this malicious rumour that i ran mad cow disease stories simply because angus black , the british beef baron ,
lost 10, 000 to me at poker and refused to pay .
nor did i take 100 million francs from the french to keep the stories running .
excuse me , mr carver .
yes ?
this is the new banker , mr ...
bond .
james bond .
i seem to collect bankers .
mr bond , how is the market reacting to the crisis ?
currencies are off .
your stock is soaring .
i don' t believe we' ve met .
elliot carver .
wai lin , from the new china news agency .
i don' t recall seeing your name on the guest list .
it' s not .
i snuck in .
why , my dear ?
i wanted to meet you .
outstanding .
i admire a woman who takes the initiative .
you should work in my beijing bureau .
mr carver , you don' t have a bureau in beijing .
call me elliot .
i always wondered how i' d feel if i saw you again .
now i know .
was it something i said ?
how about the words " i' il be right back " ?
something came up .
something always came up .
and how are you , paris ?
much better now .
we' re even .
drink , mrs carver ?
mr bond will have a vodka martini , shaken , not stirred .
mrs carver will have a tequila .
straight shot .
no .
mrs carver will have a glass of mr carver' s champagne .
you' ve moved up in the world , paris .
and tonight , you' re a banker .
i saw the guest list .
do you still sleep with a gun under your pillow ?
to you .
no .
to the gun .
i take it this isn' t a social visit .
your husband may be in trouble .
if you' re going after him , you' re the one in trouble .
it' s either him or someone in his organisation .
and you figured you could charm the dirt out of me .
no .
that wasn' t my plan .
good .
because i' ve made my bed .
you don' t sleep in it anymore .
there you are .
darling .
i' ve been looking for you .
meet wai lin , new china news agency .
hello , mrs carver .
it' s a pleasure .
and this is james bond .
you know each other ?
oh , we' re old friends .
he dated my roommate in zurich .
i' m thinking of getting wai lin behind a news desk .
i' m sure she won' t resist ... too much .
ahem .
elliot , i was wondering about your satellites , your global position .
they' re merely tools for information , mr bond .
or disinformation .
if you wanted to manipulate the course of governments or people ... or even a ship .
that' s very interesting , mr bond .
you have a vivid imagination ... for a banker .
you should write a novel .
heavens , no .
i' d be lost at sea .
adrift .
mr carver .
hmm ?
ah .
it' s time to begin the festivities .
excuse me .
darling ?
how do you really know him ?
he' s a banker .
i met him in zurich .
you' re a terrible liar , dear .
i have a problem with a banker .
could i see you a moment ?
ladies and gentlemen .
mr carver' s broadcast will be starting in 10 minutes .
what kind of banking do you specialise in , mr bond ?
hostile take overs .
shall we ?
carver must feel at home in a room like this .
it' s nice to talk to the world .
looks like there' s someone who wants to talk to you .
mr bond , you have an urgent phone call .
ladies and gentlemen , we are live in 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 ...
good evening .
tonight' s broadcast was supposed to celebrate the completion of the carver global satellite network .
but , as you' re well aware , terrible conflict looms tonight in the south china sea , which has the potential to destroy every human being on earth .
i want to assure my viewers that i , elliot carver , have spoken with the prime minister in london and the chairman in beijing ...
it' s a soundproof room , mr bond .
nobody hears you scream .
we have made contact .
make him uncomfortable .
i' il be there in a few moments . .. with its printing presses and its satellite facilities linking every ...
you seem very concerned about mr carver' s business .
he wants to know why .
why did i do it , you ask .
the answer is simple : power .
the power to illuminate the far corners of the globe , for higher understanding between the people of this great planet .
maybe we play a number on his head .
what do i expect in return ?
world wide domination .
complete , utter , total world wide domination , but not over government or religion or ideology .
over tyranny and isolation and news .
the carver network has the ability . to reach ...
herr stamper !
but do not fear me , for tonight i reveal my declaration of principles , a promise to the men and women of this planet whom i so humbly serve .
i promise to report the news without fear or favour .
i promise to be a force for good in this world .
fighting injustice , crushing intolerance , battling inhumanity ...
it' s time ... .. for a station break . .. that is the goal of the carver ...
what' s happened ?
we' ve lost power .
what ? !
ladies and gentlemen , please stay calm .
we will go on in a few minutes time .
you don' t know ?
you' re fired !
and in a rather embarrassing note , media mogul elliot carver was cut off the air tonight during the inaugural broadcast of his satellite network .
sorry , elliot , we didn' t do it .
glorious evening , wasn' t it ?
ignore those people .
these things happen .
not to me .
not to me !
when i was 16 , i went to work for a newspaper in hong kong .
it was a rag , but the editor taught me one important lesson .
the key to a great story is not who or what or when ... but why .
your friend , mr bond , made a mess tonight .
i want to know why .
i told you , i barely know him .
barely ?
i was curious who carver would send .
he' s on to you .
well , we know where you stand .
you' ve made your bed .
i' m standing in your doorway .
then turn around and go home .
tell him you didn' t get anything out of me .
that' s it ?
go home ?
i didn' t ask you to get involved in this .
it' s too late for that .
why did you marry him ?
he told me he loved me .
that always sounds good .
i used to look in the papers every day for your obituary .
i' m sorry .
i keep disappointing you .
what was it , james ?
did i get too close ?
did i get too close for comfort ?
yes .
i missed you .
what did you find ?
i hacked into the bank .
they' re using ss l2 , 128 ...
spare me the techno babble .
bond' s got a perfect employment record .
he' s crossed every t , he' s dotted every i.
which means ?
government agent .
if it sounds too good to be true , it always is .
do you think my wife knows ?
if you dial down the ambient noise ...
james , do you still sleep with a gun under your pillow ?
play it again .
do you still sleep with a gun under your pillow ?
i think we should set an appointment for my wife with the doctor .
do you still sleep with a gun under your pillow ?
i have to go .
no , you don' t .
i can get you out of the country .
no one can protect me from him , not even you .
you have a choice .
only if you let him go .
i can' t do that .
he has a secret lab on the top floor .
paris , you don' t have to do this .
don' t argue with me , james .
you know ... this job of yours ...
it' s murder on relationships .
until i get back next week ,
i want two guards 24 hours a day .
nobody gets in .
we' il take care of it .
what do we do with the satellite ?
send this thing off to the launch site .
and be careful .
it' s worth $300 million .
looking for a news story ?
they' il print anything these days .
yes ?
good morning , mr bond .
elliot carver .
i believe you' ve got two items that belong to me .
what are you talking about ?
the red box , mr bond .
and my wife in your hotel room .
he' s coming .
fingerprint i. d. accepted .
select security system level .
tell me if you find the encoder .
call me immediately .
ja .
the president said he can " feel their pain .
some late news it is with great sadness that we announce the death of paris carver , the wife of elliot carver , chairman of this network .
according to police in hamburg , germany ,
mrs carver was found dead in a hotel suite in that city in unusual circumstances on which police have refused to elaborate .
oh , paris !
her body was discovered along with the body of an unidentified man , the victim of a self inflicted gun wound .
i have a clear shot , mr bond .
stand up ... slowly .
drop your gun und kick it toward me , ja ?
good .
now lie down on the bed next to mrs carver . .. we extend our deepest sympathies to mr carver .
it will be on the news in an hour .
tomorrow' s news today .
just so .
my name is dr kaufman .
i am an outstanding pistol marksman .
take my word for it , ja ?
get the sledgehammers .
she struggled terribly , mr bond .
it' s a pity you got her involved her in this .
it won' t look like suicide if you shoot me from there .
i am a professor of forensic medicine .
i could shoot you from stuttgart , und still create the proper effect .
ow !
herr stamper .
my art is in great demand all over the world , mr bond .
i am especially good at the celebrity overdose .
now , i am afraid our little ...
stamper , stop yelling in my ear .
sir , they can' t get into the car .
you can' t be serious .
did you call the auto club ?
make him tell you how to open it .
ok , i' il ask .
this is very embarrassing .
there is a red box in your car .
they want me to make you unlock the car .
i feel like an idiot .
i don' t know what to say .
i am to torture you if you don' t do it .
you have a doctorate in that , too ?
no , this is more like a hobby .
but i am very gifted .
oh , i believe you .
my cell phone opens the car ...
no , mr bond !
i do it .
recall , 3 , send .
wait .
i' m just a professional doing a job .
me too .
dr kaufman .
welcome .
please fasten seat belt .
reduce speed .
pedestrians in roadway .
obstruction ahead .
reduce speed now .
unsafe driving will void warranty . .
congratulations on a safe journey .
u. s. airbase south china sea
u. s. airbase south china sea
yo , jimbo !
wade , what are you doing here ?
the world' s my office .
this way .
did q bring you up to speed ?
yeah .
i brought the gps unit .
officially , uncle sam is neutral in this turkey shoot .
and unofficially ?
we don' t want world war ill unless we start it .
dr greenwalt is the air force gps expert .
the gps encoder is one of the most closely guarded secrets in the u. s. military .
show him what you got !
the missing encoder !
how did you get that ?
picked it up in hamburg yesterday .
could somebody use this to send a ship off course ?
like the devonshire ?
did anyone mention devonshire ?
no ...
good !
so answer the man' s question .
in theory , you could send a ship off course .
like putting a magnet beside a compass .
exactly .
then check this out .
those two circles should line up on top of each other .
somebody' s tampered with this .
if we knew where the devonshire thought she was , could you figure out where she sank ?
sure .
wade .
yeah ?
i have a small favour to ask .
the high altitude , low opening jump is where we get the most fatalities .
for five miles use your oxygen , or you' il die of asphyxiation .
like my first marriage .
pop the chute at 200 feet below the chinese radar .
you' il be travelling over 200 mph .
be careful not to crack your skull open .
i' il keep that in mind .
when you hit the water , don' t forget to cut away your chute .
90 %%% of the people killed get tangled up and drown .
seems a lot to save the world .
i have to prove that ship was deliberately set off course .
one minute !
the pick up set ?
the extraction team will pick you up after dark .
buddha bless .
i just noticed something .
this is where the ship thought it was .
this is where it really is .
but see that island there ?
where he' s jumping is not technically chinese waters .
they belong to vietnam .
vietnam ? !
vietnam ? !
he have any u. s. government markings on him ?
the parachute , the wetsuit , the fins !
jesus , if the vietnamese catch him !
he didn' t say good bye .
still interested in hostile take overs ?
it' s the opportunities to travel that i like about banking .
bring the boat over .
bring the boat over .
what are you looking for ?
get them out of the water .
if i didn' t know better , i' d say you were following me .
we seem to have developed an attachment to each other .
hopefully , not for long .
another carver building .
i' d say he' s developed an edifice complex .
general chang .
friend of yours ?
mr bond .
miss lin .
welcome to saigon .
nice to see you , elliot .
i hadn' t intended opening this centre until tomorrow , but you can help me write the inaugural story your obituaries .
i hope you extended the same courtesy to paris .
actually , mr bond , you wrote her obituary when you asked her to betray me .
still , let' s see .
british secret service agent james bond and his collaborator wai lin of the chinese external security force were found ... dead this morning in vietnam .
lacks punch , don' t you think ?
it' s old news .
we' ve been working together for months .
we know what you and chang are up to .
i don' t think so .
you may have seen the general just now , but perhaps you' ve not had chance to peruse today' s headlines .
i like the last one .
it isn' t even mine .
i never believe the press anyway .
therein lies your problem , mr bond .
we' re men of action , but your era is passing .
words are the new weapons , satellites the new artillery .
and you become the new supreme allied ... commander ?
exactly .
caesar had his legions , napoleon his armies ,
i have my divisions tv , news , magazines .
and by midnight tonight , i' il have influenced more people than anyone in history save god himself .
and the best he managed was a sermon on the mount .
you are insane .
the distance between insanity and genius is measured only by success .
general chang is waiting .
if you' il forgive me .
your appearance has forced me
your appearance has forced me to move up my timetable slightly .
i' il leave you with mr stamper and his toys .
perhaps you' d like to see them .
sir , the helicopter .
mr stamper is a protege of the late dr kaufman , who was schooling him in the ancient art of chakra torture .
he was like a father to me .
interesting role model .
the body has seven chakra points energy centres like the heart or genitals .
these implements probe those organs , inflicting maximum pain whilst keeping the victim alive as long as possible .
dr kaufman' s record was 52 hours .
i' m hoping to break it .
watching your tv shows is torture enough .
save this one till last .
when you remove mr bond' s heart , there should be enough time for him to watch it stop beating .
we can use the banner .
hope it holds .
get after them !
ready ?
go !
oh , sheesh .
next time , i' il take the elevator .
get a car !
no !
a bike is quicker .
keys .
someone always forgets them .
i' m driving .
get off !
get on the back .
i' m slipping .
stop fidgeting !
what are you ...
give me that !
clutch , clutch , clutch !
right .
no , left .
who' s driving ?
clutch !
left !
left !
how many back there ?
i can' t see .
hold on .
what are you ...
don' t get any ideas .
i' d never dream of it .
one .
no , two .
go for the barrels .
very good .
hold on !
let' s take the highway .
helicopter !
keep your shirt on .
get on the back .
are you trying to protect me ?
no , i need to balance the bike .
you ready ?
go !
pop the clutch .
it' s behind us .
get out of the way !
get down !
get down !
you see the chopper ?
i can' t see .
hold on .
trapped .
never .
would you pass the soap ?
over there .
you were pretty good with that hook .
i grew up in a rough neighbourhood .
you were pretty good on the bike .
well , i didn' t grow up at all .
here .
allow me .
don' t get any ideas , mr bond .
just off the cuff , i thought we might link up .
walk hand in hand ?
stick closely to each other .
maybe we' il go after general chang together .
thanks for washing my hair .
i work alone .
lucky for you i stopped by .
i could' ve taken care of him .
hmm , but you didn' t .
give me the earring .
copy of a macro 59 .
standard issue , chinese army .
looks like general chang wants you dead .
still think you can do this alone ?
is your mission peace or revenge ?
this is about stopping a war .
last year , stealth material went missing from one of chang' s bases .
i followed a lead to carver in hamburg .
stealth material ?
we thought he was building a stealth plane .
no .
stealth boat .
that' s how they got close to the devonshire , to drill inside the missile room .
they stole a cruise missile .
he' s moving the timetable to midnight .
he' il position the stealth boat near the british fleet and fire the missile into china .
and we will retaliate .
and carver provides the pictures .
i have to warn beijing .
no .
let' s get our governments talking .
we' il find the boat .
stand up .
stand up .
just like home .
you get the equipment , i' il send the messages .
on second thoughts , you type .
first we have to find the boat .
of all the harbours and inlets controlled by chang , 22 are in highly populated areas .
that leaves 14 to hide the boat in .
it' s invisible to radar but not the human eye .
very novel .
he' d have to sail to the devonshire and back in a night .
this looks familiar .
we made some improvements .
did you , indeed ?
ok , 4 hours out and 4 hours back .
assume the boat is travelling at 30 knots .
i' m a fan of chinese technology .
there are four places where he could harbour the boat .
on your left .
check those areas .
ah , a new walther .
i asked q to get me one .
i' ve got it .
look .
four missing boats , three unexplained drownings .
ha long bay .
he knows the island .
he says it' s dangerous for boats there at sunset .
but for $5, 000 , he' il take us .
good .
maybe he' il take a cheque .
it' s mostly dull routine , but every now and then , you get to work with a decadent agent of a corrupt western power .
and they say communists can' t have fun .
i hate to disappoint you , but i don' t even have a little red book .
if anything happens to me , the fuses for the mines are in here .
we' re gonna finish this together .
and if i may say so , you' ve found the right decadent western agent as a partner .
see the stealth ?
no .
it' s getting late and this is the last cove .
yeah , that' s it .
set your timers for 10 minutes .
time to get out before it explodes .
if it doesn' t sink , our fleets will finish it .
if they got our message .
ok , you , up and over .
we' re in position between the fleets .
we' re in position between the fleets .
fire one missile at each flagship .
the chinese will think the british are rattling the sabre .
the british will think the chinese are being belligerent .
and the media will provide cool , objective coverage .
let the mayhem begin .
tms bedford .
british fleet .
tms bedford .
british fleet .
missile lock on .
signal to admiralty .
missile lock on .
signal to admiralty .
task crew under missile attack .
two waves of land based mig 21s inbound .
should be on our screens in 2 minutes .
how long before the migs are within firing range ?
12 minutes .
what the hell do i pay you for ?
if she' s there , bond is there .
stamper , find them !
wai lin , wai lin , camera !
if she blinks , kill her .
you , come with me .
stamper to bridge .
bond is dead .
delicious .
bring the girl up to me .
are you sure you want her up here ?
it' s my business , mr gupta .
i like an audience .
ah , ms lin .
your countrymen are so predictably eager to save face .
they know you are here .
they' re looking for you .
not according to our radar .
it seems your migs will attack the british fleet in ... ?
nine minutes to firing range .
even if they were looking for me , they can' t see me on a stealth boat .
or you .
or your friend , the late commander bond , who is on his way to the bottom of the south china sea .
he' s my new anchorman .
pathetic .
what on earth' s going on ?
a message from 007 , confirmed by my opposite number in china .
search for a ship that' s almost invisible to radar .
the chinese aren' t the enemy .
carver' s been playing both sides for fools .
message from the admiralty .
look at this .
is there anything on the radar that looks very small ?
lifeboat , periscope ?
no , sir .
a stealth boat they' ve gone mad .
what you' re about to witness , ms lin , is not so much a missile attack but the launch of a new world order .
in 5 minutes , once your countrymen attack the british ,
i shall retaliate for dear old england by sending this missile into beijing , where general chang has just called an emergency meeting of the chinese high command .
unfortunately ...
general chang ... will be delayed in traffic , arriving just after the missile has killed your leaders .
too late to stop the air force from sinking the entire british fleet .
but he will be just in time to take over the government , negotiate a truce , and emerge as a world leader with the nobel peace prize .
and what do you get ?
me ?
oh ... nothing .
just exclusive broadcasting rights in china for 100 years .
ready to rock and ruin .
excuse me , my dear .
i have a deadline to meet .
prepare for the missile launch .
mr gupta .
hello , elliot .
interesting plan .
i have something here that belongs to you .
so much for german efficiency .
mr stamper .
don' t shoot him yet .
hold your fire .
welcome to my world crisis , mr bond .
even trade , elliot .
gupta for wai lin .
you can' t fire the missile without him .
and it seems you can' t resist any woman in my possession .
what are you waiting for ?
shoot him !
i told you .
we' re gonna finish this together .
how romantic .
do you realise how absurd your position is ?
no more absurd than starting a war for ratings .
great men manipulate the media to save the world .
look at william randolph hearst , who told his photographers , " you provide the pictures , and i' il provide the war .
i' m just taking it one step further .
sorry about that .
i , er ... tuned out there for a moment , elliot .
touche .
mr gupta , is the missile ready to fire ?
press the magic button , beijing disappears .
then it seems you' ve outlived your contract .
you see , mr bond , i have a back up plan .
uh huh , so do i.
he' s breached the hull .
they' il see us on radar .
sir , we have a small intermittent contact on the surface plot , bearing 1 1 2 degrees .
can' t get the range , but it wasn' t there a second ago .
tell all ships do not fire on the chinese for any reason whatsoever .
have sighted unknown ship ...
get those fires out !
go and protect the missile .
oh , and , mr stamper , would you please kill those bastards ? !
nice work .
they' re speeding up .
we have to stop the boat .
take care of the engine room and get off the ship .
i' il stop the missile .
captain , a signal from the chinese fleet commander .
to royal navy task group .
we also have the unknown ship on our screens .
we will not fire unless it turns towards china .
until then she' s yours .
captain , whatever the hell that thing is , sink it .
right , sir .
is that echo too weak for missile lock ?
yes , sir .
right .
we' il do it the old fashioned way .
bond turned us into the target .
bond turned us into the target .
along with himself .
take evasive action .
prepare the missile countdown immediately .
initialising launch sequence .
t minus 5 minutes and counting .
t minus 5 minutes and counting .
sir , they' re making 48 knots .
they' il be out of visual range within 2 minutes .
keep firing .
slow them down .
the engines are out .
we' re sitting ducks here .
follow me !
t minus 4 minutes and counting .
ok .
well done .
officer watch , increase max .
keep firing !
all hands , abandon ship .
abandon ship .
abandon ship .
abandon ship .
mr stamper , what are you doing about the girl ?
perhaps you' d consider looking in the engine room .
t minus 3 minutes and counting .
you' re too late again , mr bond .
it' s a bad habit of yours .
there' s nothing you can do .
t minus 2 minutes and counting .
the missile' s fully programmed .
it can' t restart .
in a matter of minutes , my plan will succeed .
and thanks largely to your efforts , the british navy will destroy the evidence .
and i' il be out of here in a carver news helicopter covering the event .
it' s going to be a fantastic show !
i may have some breaking news for you .
you forgot the first rule of mass media !
give the people what they want !
t minus one minute and counting .
drop it , mr bond ... or i' il drop your friend .
it' s over , stamper .
let her go .
not between you and me .
james , try to detonate it .
the missile will set them off .
never argue with a woman .
they' re always right .
t minus 40 seconds .
for carver !
and kaufman !
i owe you an unpleasant death , mr bond .
nein !
t minus 20 seconds .
we die together , mr bond .
t minus 10 seconds .
two ...
one ...
m , bedford reports that carver went down with his ship .
it seems that bond made it .
moneypenny , take this release .
elliot carver is missing , presumed drowned while on a cruise aboard his luxury yacht in the south china sea .
at present , the local authorities believe the media mogul committed suicide .
commander bond ,
colonel lin , this is the hms bedford .
are you there ?
they' re looking for us , james .
let' s stay undercover .
