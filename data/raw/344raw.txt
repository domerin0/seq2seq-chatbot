you should stay in your seat until the plane reaches the terminal .
no frequent flier mileage for you .
who are you ?
a cop .
a cop ?
yeah , one of the good guys .
you' re one of the bad guys .
now i' ve got your sorry ass , i' m going to trade it for my wife .
sit down !
go in !
where did he go ?
in there .
i don' t believe this .
two months of planning , ... .. and you can' t anticipate one pendejo of a cop .
come on , general .
where is colonel stuart ?
general !
i' m all right .
he said he was a policeman .
i thought you had this place secured .
he went in the cockpit .
he' s going to hell !
mcclane !
i assume it' s you , mcclane .
you' re quite a little soldier .
you can consider this a military funeral !
aaagh !
how many grenades we got ?
three each !
use them !
oh , fuck .
go !
aaagh !
oh , shit !
you lucky fuck .
fire trucks , sir .
fall back to the church .
now !
where' s the fucking door ?
they' re getting a little nervous back there .
in fact , so am l .
we' re over washington .
see if you can get any tv to settle them down .
works for me .
i' il ...
writing your acceptance speech for the video sleaze awards ?
try pulitzer .
ladies and gentlemen , ... .. while waiting to land , we are turning on local washington tv .
the sound is on channel three .
ok .
ok , ok .
please , sir , we may land at any moment .
if you' il take your seat ...
i' m going to be sick .
i' m going to be sick .
sir , the seat belt light is on .
moron .
wzdc .
this is richard thornberg .
put me through to ruben in the newsroom .
he' s about to go live .
i know he is .
that' s why i need him .
you' il have to hold on ...
put me through , celia , or start typing your resume .
esperanza' s down , ... .. but he' s hurt .
he took a round in his shoulder .
i got one more of their guys .
that' s six they lost altogether .
if we knew how many they had to start with , we could get excited , ... .. but if they got 50 guys , it' s a little early to open the champagne !
we appreciate your effort , but we don' t need a loose cannon here !
what if they crash another plane in retaliation for your stunt ?
they can' t do that now , right , barnes ?
besides , if i grabbed esperanza , this would be over now .
maybe they' re more creative than you think !
well , at least i' m thinking , goddammit !
we' re here to jerk off that cocksucker until he tries to take off .
period !
you' re the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time !
the story of my life .
major !
pentagon situation room , sir !
pentagon .
i' il take it in here .
thank you , telford .
you men come with me .
mcclane .
yeah , barnes .
you said those guys showed up right away ?
yeah .
that means they' re on the field or close .
and i think i know where .
let me show you something .
these are the old plans with the longer runways .
that' s 12 years ago .
looks like they' ve modified the site , ... .. moved tra con phones , ils , all the underground stuff ... .. so they could handle drainage .
if i' m right , ... .. it would run along the airport property ... .. and go right past this neighbourhood .
we should have landed two hours ago !
i understand , but if you just relax ...
it' s hopeless .
somebody ought to get their ass kicked for this mess .
unfortunately , there isn' t anyone we can blame for the weather .
oh , yeah ?
what about that porker , willard scott ?
i should have taken the bus .
at least they can pull over for food and gas .
excuse me .
yes ?
i was just wondering .
this flight originally was supposed to be 5 hours , right ?
mm hmm .
do we have enough fuel to keep circling like this ?
oh , of course .
they anticipate little problems like this .
we looked at 12 fucking houses , and we' re nowhere .
this is our last possibility .
over here there' s an old church .
let' s go .
wait .
there' s the church over there .
could be a sentry .
he could just be out for a walk .
then why is he going over his own footsteps ?
come on .
all right .
stay here and get ready to call the marines .
i thought they were the army .
who gives a fuck ?
just be ready .
oh , shit .
lorenzo , it' s barnes .
where the hell didyou go ?
where' s mcclane ?
with me , at the hidey lake church , to the west of the airport .
where ?
goddammit !
you crazy idiot , why didn' t ...
this must be their operations base .
shut up and getyour ass here !
code red !
sitrep .
we got positive id on stuart' s location .
let' s move .
yo !
our escape plane will be ready within 30 minutes , general .
if there are no more surprises .
gentlemen , we have a situation here .
aagh !
ugh !
over here .
jeez , mcclane , you all right ?
you want a medic ?
what the hell you think you' re doing , playing john wayne ?
how would you like to spend the night in a cell ?
lorenzo , shut the fuck up and do something useful .
go seal off the street .
hey , you can' t talk to me like that .
oh , no , carmine ?
sergeant , get this bureaucrat out of mr mcclane' s face now .
with pleasure , sir .
major , the men are in position , sir .
close up the back .
then we go in .
fire only on my order .
roger that , sir .
guess i was wrong about you .
you' re not such an asshole after all .
no , you were right .
i' m just your kind of asshole .
garber , sitrep !
army special forces on three sides , closing in fast around the back !
another problem , colonel ?
no problem , general .
gentlemen , you know what to do .
down !
get down !
get down !
general , ... .. it' s time .
come on , let' s move it !
they' re pulling out ... at the back !
what ?
move it !
albertson , take your men around the back .
aagh !
aagh !
this equipment could land our planes .
there are trip wires .
they could have booby trapped ...
they did .

looks like c 4 .
the motherfucker is armed .
clear the area !
everybody , now !
they booby trapped all the equipment .
seal off the building !
shit !
post sentries .
no civilians allowed .
hey , where the fuck is mcclane ?
miller , take him !
i' il cover you !
aagh !

let' s move out .
i had the bastard in my sights .
i know i did .
oh , jesus christ .
attention .
attention , dulles tower .
this is colonel stuart .
is ourplane prepared ?
it is .
it' s in hangar 11 .
it' s the most remote building we' ve got .
we' re on our way .
have a ground crew there to confiirm the condition ofthe plane .
do you believe the balls on this son of a bitch ?
colonel , you' re quite capable of confiirming ityourself .
don' t ask us to gift wrap potential hostages foryou .
major grant , isn' t it ?
ifyou remember me , colonel , ... .. then you remember i know the drill as well as you do .
check out your own fucking plane .
we move out in five minutes .
flak jackets for everybody .
body armour for the assault team .
night scopes for the snipers .
we will take them in the hangar , and i will pull that detonator ... .. out of stuart' s dead fucking hand myself .
lorenzo , take all your men back to the airport .
seal off every exit , ... .. in case they try to slip past us to break out onto the ground .
you got it .
all right , here we go .
this is nuts !
every station has people at the airport , ... .. and no one has heard a whisper ofthis shit !
none of them is me .
you want proof , try this .
repeat .
terrorists have murdered civilians ... .. and cut offthe two systems that can allowyou to land .
a special us army unit is here , preparing to take out the terrorists .
jesus christ .
i wantyou to go live now .
get me in from the fiiles .
a publicity shot .
the maps , steal one from weather .
we' re on it .
we' re cutting in five minutes !
tell the affiliates if they want in , they got three minutes to shout .
let' s do this .
network , here i come .
telford , what was your chicken shit outfit doing ... .. while we were taking grenada ?
grenada .
five minutes of fire fight , five weeks of surfing .
i wish i was with you guys for that .
yeah .
me , too , kid .
really , sir ?
sure .
then we wouldn' t have to do this .
eagle nest , this is hatchling .
on schedule ... and in position .
roger , hatchling .
we are secure here .
you have a green light .
i repeat , a green light .
ugh !
jesus , officer , where did you come from , ... .. pearl harbour ?
all right , let' s clear it out , please .
stand by .
five , four , three ...
this is a special bulletin from wzdc news .
there has been a plane crash at dulles , where other aircraft still circle , ... .. with no explanation from airport or faa offiicials .
and now , with an exclusive wzdc report , ... .. here' s dick thornberg reporting from the skies over washington .
i' m one ofthe thousandpeople who has been circling our capital ... .. under the assumption that whatever problem there was below was a normal one .
but the truth is far from normal .
the truth is terrifying .
look out !
lady , look out !
look out !
look out !
look out !
look out !
get out of the way !
get out of the way !
get out of the way , lady !
go , go !
hey , hey , look out !
this is a recording of a conversation ... .. between dulles tower and a captive aircraft overhead .
get out of the way !
lorenzo !
are you out of your fucking mind ?
where' s the blue light team ?
stuart' s rigged explosives to a remote .
where' s grant ?
they' re going to kill that son of a bitch and get it from them !
no , they' re going to take off on that plane with him !
get the fuck out of here !
when the army canned stuart , he loaded that unit with his men !
are you nuts ?
that fire fight ...
sideshow to buy him some time .
mcclane , you are completely around the fucking bend .
you' re under arrest , motherfucker .
these are the bullets they used out there tonight !
blanks !
jesus christ .
this is chief lorenzo .
i want every officer recalled and in body armour and full weaponry ... .. in the motor pool in five minutes .
it' s time to kick ass .
just like lwo jima !
we have learned that the terrorists have control ofthe airport , ... .. a fact that the authorities have repressed .
the terrorists promise more bloodshed unless their demands are met .
now that the special army commandos have arrived at the airport , ... .. the likelihood of a full scale battle is dangerously close .
that stupid , arrogant son of a bitch .
it' s all over the airport .
300 people have died ...
when are we going to land ? .. and unfortunately , they may not be the last .
the horrifying fact is that no one is safe , ... .. either in the planes above dulles or in the terminal below .
the threat ofa new and higher body count at the airport ... .. hangs over the heads ofeveryone , ... .. and the holiday season ofpeace and love has become a nightmare .
all right , listen up !
all units , i want you to converge on hangar 11 , ... .. all sides !
this car , mcclane !
get in !
when the city blue show up with their backup , ... .. they' il pick up the pieces !
now , move out !
mcclane , say hi to my brother vito .
merry christmas .
hi .
goddammit to hell !
move that piece of shit !
will you move that goddamn piece of shit ... .. out of here ?
vito , get the fuck out of the car !
get your ass in gear and help me !
will you get ... ?
move that car right now !
right there .
get that .
hey , coleman !
sam !
sam coleman !
hey , coleman !
hi !
coleman !
.. but at least the truth is not among the hostages ... .. because i , richard thornberg , just happened to be here ... .. to put his life and talent on the line for humanity and country .
if this should be my final broadcast ...
amen to that , ...
