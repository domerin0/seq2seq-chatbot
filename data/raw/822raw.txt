all i' m saying is that cats are known ... to be very territorial animals ... and it' s likely that it did attack ... but that doesn' t mean it was possessed .
maybe you two should sleep together .
what are you getting at , professor ?
i' m just saying that if indeed this cat did attack ... it' s less likely to come back if the two of you were ...
let' s say ... together .
oh , come on , it' s college .
it' s time for you two to experiment .
i don' t think we' re gonna be getting much help here .
oh , on the contrary , actually ...
i' d be more than happy to walk you through it .

there' s a whole lot of freaky shit ... going on in this house .
there' s more to this story than the professor told us .
last night , i found a secret room ... and i found all these newspaper clippings ... about hugh kane .
he was a really evil man .
and i found a picture of his wife .
oh , my god !
she looks just like you .
you think ?
she doesn' t have as many split ends ... and her skin' s not as oily as yours .
oh , yeah .
yeah .
sometimes you do this little squinty thing with your eyes .
it looks like you got down syndrome or something .
oh , yeah , y' all look just alike ... except she got some perfect boobs ... and yours look like them old orangutan titties .
ha , ha , ha , ha , ha !

i don' t need your help .
i can do it myself .
aah !

i think you should consider ... cutting the experiment short .
what ?
this poltergeist is growing increasingly more violent .
i think we' re all in danger here ... and i' ve got to put my foot down ... and stand up for what i believe in ... and say that we' ve got to pull the plug .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , dwight .
i say when we pull the plug .
we are on the verge of greatness ... and i am this close to getting laid .
now , the bus arrives on monday .
no one leaves till then .
here are the keys to the gate .
no one gets access to them .
yes , sir .
guys , i think the professor' s up to something .
i heard dwight tell the professor ... there could be a poltergeist in the house ... and that we could all be in danger !
oh , no , son !
not a poltergeist !
what' s a poltergeist ?
i' m getting out of here .
no .
we can' t go anywhere .
the gates are locked .
dwight' s the only one who has the keys .
baby , get my vaseline .

we' il shave off our pubic hairs ... and wear the shampoo for two weeks !

we' re gonna use these guns .
they emit a bolt of concentrated energy ... which can damage the ectoplasmic cells ... and destroy the ghost .

ha , ha , ha , ha !
hey !
hey !
hey !
conserve your ammunition .
my bad .
all right .
now , the only way ... we' re gonna be able to track these ghosts ... is if we' re all wearing one of these .
these are thermo goggles .
they work on the principle of body heat .
they' re so powerful , they can detect ... where any bodily fluids have been ... even if they' ve been wiped clean .
what ?
ew .
are my glasses crooked ?
now listen , that ghost may be invisible ... but we have the advantage of being armed ... with the most sophisticated high tech equipment ... known to man .
how do we stay in touch with each other ?
do we have some walkie talkies ?
no .
we have these .
those is dixie cups .
well , we kind of ran short of funds ... after the guns and the goggles .
all right .
now let' s split up .
uh uh !
uh uh !
uh uh !
now wait a minute !
hold up !
how come every time some scary shit happens ... that we need to stick together ... you white people always say , " let' s split up " ?
