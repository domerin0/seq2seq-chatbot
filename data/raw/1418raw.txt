hyper metal sonic , the only thing left is to capture his essential life data .
then you will be complete .
when you awaken , it will be time !
sonic !
it' s finally done !
see , isn' t it great ?
it' s a jet propelled body board !
come on , sonic .
don' t you want to try it too ?
no thanks .
all right , i' il try it myself !
i guess tails is still just a little kid .
come on , sonic !
it' s okay if you can' t swim !
you should give it a try !
just don' t get cocky and run into something .
i must be hearing things .
sonic !
help me !
wake up , sonic !
come on , sonic !
shut up , tails !
sonic .
are you all right , sonic ?
i' m fine , but who was that ?
sonic , how have you been ?
oh no , not that old man again !
i' il pass on this one .
sonic , we' ve got to hurry up and do something !
you' re the one who can fly , why don' t you go do something ?
sonic , you idiot !
fine , i can take care of this all by myself !
mister !
mister !
tails , it' s you !
it' s nice to see you again .
i have some urgent business with sonic .
that' s why i' m here .
mister , this isn' t the time to worry about that .
your rocket' s on fire !
what ?
no wonder it' s getting so warm in here !
just hold on !
i' il fix it somehow !
i' m not finished yet !
hey , you' re pretty good at this , tails !
i got some practice in earlier on my body board .
that' s amazing !
mister , up ahead !
look out !
what are you talking about ?
let' s see .
sonic !
thank you , sonic !
old man !
hey , old man !
ouch !
old man , you should stop flying those dangerous things .
what are you talking about , sonic ?
i know i' m a little older now , but back in my heyday i won the speed races on planet freedom all the time .
believe me , i was pretty popular with the ladies back then too .
mister , didn' t you say you had some urgent business ?
oh , right .
it' s a real emergency .
it' s the president .
he wanted ...
he wants us to come to the presidential palace right away ?
right , that was it !
please hurry !
old man , you could have just called to tell us that .
oh , yeah , i guess i could' ve done that .
old man , take care of the place while we' re gone !
i understand !
i don' t think so .
let' s go , tails !
bon voyage !
mr. president , what' s the urgent business ?
right , the business .
it' s been a long time , hasn' t it , sonic , tails .
it' s eggman !
please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way .
that' s a funny way to show your gratitude .
don' t do it , please !
sonic , for the sake of my daughter and everyone else , listen to him !
that' s a dirty trick , eggman .
eggman !
you kidnaped them so you could take over south island , didn' t you ?
do you think really think i would do something that underhanded ?
of course !
listen , sonic .
this concerns all of planet freedom , so you' d better listen to everything i have to say .
no way .
don' t you care what happens to pretty , young sarah ?
help me , papa !
sarah !
sonic , please listen to what eggman has to say !
i guess i don' t have a choice .
go ahead and talk , eggman .
really , sonic ?
as both of you are aware , planet freedom is made up of two separate dimensions .
the outer world , the one you live in , is known as the land of the sky .
we already know all that .
quiet !
just shut up !
and the inner dimension is known as the land of darkness .
i live peacefully in the inner dimension , where i have created a high tech city called eggmanland .
black eggman .
i don' t know where he came from , but he attacked my city with a battalion of robots .
they completely conquered us .
now , there is no place down there for me to live .
black eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored .
he jammed the robot generator , causing it to run wild .
according to my calculations , if the robot generator isn' t stopped by sunrise tomorrow , there will be a giant explosion !
fine !
but don' t blame me when this happens !
what can we do to stop this , eggman ?
someone has to get through all of black eggman' s traps .
then he has to get into eggmanland and stop that generator !
and it' s the fastest one here that should do it !
forget about it .
you' re the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place .
why should i have to clean up after you ?
sonic !
please do it !
south island ...
no , the entire planet is depending on you !
sonic , i don' t care what happens to eggman or papa , but please do this for both of us !
when eggman speaks , 99 times out of 100 he' s lying .
but what if this is that one other time ?
sonic !
sonic !
fine , i' il do it .
sonic ...
tails , take this with you .
what is it ?
it' s a navigator .
it will guide you to eggmanland using the shortest route , as long as you keep it with you .
thank you , eggman .
come on , tails .
tails , do you really trust that weird , little gadget that eggman gave you ?
knowing him , he might' ve put a bomb in there .
eggman is the only one that knows how to get to eggmanland .
we don' t have any other choice but to trust this thing .
guess you' re right .
even more importantly , i hope that the president and sarah are all right .
no , no , no , i don' t like it when you win every time !
all right , one more time !
that' s enough !
give up !
we' ve played a hundred times !
i' il stop being your hostage .
all right , we' il keep playing .
no , no , no , you won again !
fine !
i quit .
i want to go for a drive .
absolutely not !
no , no !
i want to go for a drive !
how did this get here ?
you rock , eggman !
i get to drive first !
don' t touch that !
no , wait !
don' t play with that !
stop it , sarah !
no , stop that !
sarah !
that must be the entrance to the land of darkness !
we' re getting some bad turbulence here , so hang on , sonic !
all right , here we go !
hang on , sonic !
we' re almost out of here !
tails !
tails , are you all right ?
i' m fine , but i' m worried about that tornado !
so this is the land of darkness !
eggmanland should be straight ahead !
all right !
let' s hurry !
tails , doesn' t something seem a little strange ?
i think eggman purposely picked the route with the most traps !
but this really is the quickest way to the generator !
there' s even be a warp zone right up ahead !
let' s get moving !
what is this place ?
let me check .
we just exited the warp zone , so this should be ...
it says these are ancient ruins .
ancient ruins ?
these ?
i never knew the land of darkness had any of this .
but eggmanland is supposed to be really near .
let' s go somewhere high and see if we can see it from there .
let' s go !
the ruins are sinking right into the ocean !
sonic , i bet it' s because the robot generator is out of control and causing reactions under the ground !
right !
we should hurry !
i' m afraid of lightning !
tails , we just have to go straight ahead , right ?
that' s what it says .
that has to be black eggman !
that is correct .
i am black eggman .
i congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here .
we don' t have time to play your little games !
get out of our way !
i don' t think so !
hold still !
ouch !
you fool , this armor is made of a super polymer alloy !
ouch !
ouch !
you ...
where are you little brats hiding ?
come out here !
we don' t have time to mess around with this guy !
which way to eggmanland ?
let me check ...
that way !
it' s past that highway !
good !
let' s go , tails !
okay , sonic !
black eggman , you slowpoke !
what ?
we know you can' t keep up right now , so we' il just have to finish this game later .
no way !
this is bad !
i didn' t know that thing could fly !
sonic !
tails , grab onto me !
we' re safe !
don' t think you' re safe yet .
neither one of you can swim , so you' il both drown in the ocean below .
i can' t swim !
gurgle , gurgle , gurgle ...
i' ve finally gotten those two out of the way !
that worked pretty well .
yeah , let' s go .
why me ?
crash !
crack !
boom !
oops !
you fools !
did you really think i' d fall for a stupid trick like that ?
take this !
what is this stuff ?
sonic !
tails !
now , it' s time for this !
now , i just have to finish you off .
there' s no way those missiles could' ve gotten rid of sonic so easily .
i told you !
it' s coming back at you , black eggman !
sonic !
oh no !
darn !
you might have the fastest feet in the world , but it you can' t run , you' re just a normal hedgehog .
you will never make it to eggmanland !
try to run away from this !
sonic , i' il save you !
knuckles !
hurry and save sonic !
oh no !
if my tails are stuck together , i can' t fly !
i' ve got it !
sonic , grab onto this !
who are you ?
sonic , you can do it !
oh no !
i' m out of ammo !
you are lucky , aren' t you !
however ...
not lucky enough !
i owe you one , knuckles .
right back at you .
it doesn' t matter .
you' re running away ?
i' m not going to let you go , black eggman !
don' t worry , we' il meet again soon !
grab onto me , sonic !
sonic' s ruined things again !
he' d better enjoy this feeling now , because once he gets to eggmanland , he' il have to fight something even worse than black eggman !
what do you mean , worse than black eggman ?
you' re talking about yourself !
you' d better keep your hands off my sonic , or i' il never forgive you !
thanks for saving us there , knuckles .
yeah , that' s one more job that i' m not going to get paid for .
oh well , we' ve been friends for long enough .
i guess i can just put this on your tab .
so will you return to treasure hunting ?
of course !
after all , that' s what i live for !
the sun' s already setting !
we' ve got to hurry !
what is that thing ?
that' s eggmanland !
incredible !
i hope we see you again , knuckles !
see you .
see you later !
knuckles !
hey , i' d worry about you two if i sent you in alone !
see you !
what are you waiting for ?
if you don' t hurry , that thing' s going to explode !
wait up , knuckles !
so this must be the entrance to eggmanland .
i never expected eggman to live in such an awesome place !
this is no time to be blown away .
you' re right .
come on , let' s go !
it' s this way .
keep going straight ahead !
got it !
i' m really starting to get excited about this , sonic .
just don' t let your guard down or you' il seriously regret it , knuckles .
i' il be fine .
sonic , leave these guys to me and go on ahead !
all right !
good luck !
tails , fly !
you have to fly !
yeah , right !
it' s too heavy for me to move !
hang on !
i' il stop this thing !
sonic !
i' il have you out of there in no time !
oh no !
gotcha !
sonic , are you all right ?
something' s moving !
it' s a robot that looks exactly like sonic !
what does all this mean ?
what is that ?
it' s pretty !
black eggman' s ghost !
it' s broken .
watch where you' re putting your hands !
i' m sorry , i didn' t mean to !
ow !
stop it , sarah !
please stop , sarah !
sarah !
why are sarah and eggman here together ?
i get it , you' re black eggman !
it wasn' t my fault !
look at that , now you' ve made her cry .
black eggman and the haywire robot generator were all part of his scheme .
he planned the whole thing to trap you !
what does all this mean , eggman ?
i don' t believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here .
now this will be your burial place !
good job , sonic !
what did you say ?
you' re kidding me !
this is the greatest invention of eggman , scientist extraordinaire !
i call it the hyper metal sonic .
pretty good , don' t you think ?
you might have made a robot that looks like him , but he' s no match for the real sonic !
tails , it should be apparent to you .
sonic wasn' t being electrocuted earlier .
instead , i was transferring all his data to the robot .
he is the fastest , most powerful battle machine every to walk planet freedom !
what are you planning on doing with that thing ?
isn' t it obvious ?
i' m going to use metal to destroy the real sonic , and then i' m going to destroy the land of the sky .
what did you say ?
there' s no way you' il get away with this !
let sarah go , eggman !
tell me that after you' ve defeated him .
go get him , hyper metal sonic !
tails , knuckles , don' t try to help me .
i want to take him out on my own !
man , he' s fast !
this is the first time i' ve ever seen sonic like this !
incredible !
absolutely incredible !
that is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever !
he' s in trouble !
sonic !
keep going , metal sonic !
sonic !
wait , tails !
sonic !
hold up , tails !
but if we don' t hurry then sonic ...
calm down , tails !
there' s no way that either one of us can catch up with them .
we' ve got to think of another way !
what ?
that' s right .
he did say something about destroying the land of the sky , didn' t he ?
i' m sorry , was that uncomfortable , sarah ?
come on , don' t be mad .
just stay with me a little bit longer .
no , i want to go home now !
if you just wait a few more minutes ,
i' il show you something really spectacular .
where did he go ?
that' s it !
perfect !
perfect !
sonic has finally been defeated !
tails !
hey , tails , what' s wrong with you ?
that' s a warp zone right in front of us !
we' re catching the tornado , and we' re going home !
hey , hey , what about sonic ?
what a nice , peaceful night .
sonic , you' re back already ?
sonic , what' s the matter ?
please stop it !
where am i ?
tails ...
i remember leaving eggmanland .
impossible !
i' ve got to stop metal !
is this all part of black eggman' s plan , too ?
oh man !
the only one that would do something like this is eggman !
it' s a lucky thing no one was staying here .
that old man was watching the house for us !
old man !
old man !
it doesn' t look like anyone touched the inside of this place .
old man , where are you ?
tails , is that you ?
are you back already ?
those are sonic' s favorite clothes !
don' t blame me if he gets mad at you !
don' t worry about it .
sonic came back last night .
he forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away .
he flew away ?
it' s metal !
metal is really wreaking havoc here .
at the rate he' s going , the land of the sky won' t last more than a few hours .
now i can take my plan to the next stage .
here you go , sarah .
this is a present for you .
yahoo !
you rock !
tails , stop tinkering with that thing !
let' s hurry up and find sonic !
hold on a second .
this machine that eggman gave me and metal sonic are built out of the same kinds of parts .
i think i can use that .
really ?
you might be able to find metal sonic ?
but what if metal sonic and sonic aren' t in the same place any more ?
don' t worry .
sonic and metal will definitely be together .
i don' t get it .
how come ?
well , all of sonic' s data was input into metal' s memory .
his personality , his likes , his dislikes , even all his thoughts .
that' s why he knew to come here .
he even gave the old man his favorite clothes .
i understand that , but metal' s still a robot .
even if he is a robot ,
metal is operating on sonic' s thoughts and motivations .
he knows everything that sonic' s ever seen or felt .
the same goes for sonic .
in other words , it' s just like they' re twins .
they' re twins , huh ?
green lake city has been flooded !
forest town is currently on fire !
we' ve discovered the source of the disturbances .
we' il patch it through to the monitors .
sonic !
lmpossible !
get sonic' s house on the line immediately .
yes , sir .
shut up already , i' m busy !
isn' t somebody going to pick that up ?
hey , tails !
isn' t anyone there ?
oh no , not that idiot !
what' s he doing now ?
hey , it' s me !
listen to me right now !
shut up !
who is this ?
who are you ?
i' m knuckles , sonic' s best friend .
i see .
is sonic there ?
is sarah safe ?
what happened to black eggman ?
did you stop the generator ?
you sure are an annoying old man .
i' m busy here !
mr. president !
look , eggman , don' t i look cute ?
yes , it suits you very well , sarah .
but why did you give me a wedding dress ?
what do you mean ?
once metal has destroyed the land of the sky , it' il just be the two of us .
then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together , sarah !
go to sleep , go to sleep , close your eyes ...
are you crazy ?
who told you i wanted to marry you anyway ?
i won' t do it !
never !
so that' s what really happened .
but i still don' t think it will enough to destroy the land of the sky .
it' s possible .
i' ve traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet , and i' ve seen it .
at the northernmost tip of this continent , all the continents in the land of the sky are linked by a huge glacier .
many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents .
they' re shaped like blood vessels under the glacier .
if the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion , the magma would pour directly into the glacier , melting all the ice .
what do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support ?
due to the centrifugal force of the planet , they' il be thrown into outer space .
this is impossible !
mr. president , please don' t tell sonic a word about any of this !
i know that !
why am i not supposed to be told about this , tails ?
sonic , you' re safe !
it' s too late .
i heard all of it .
sonic , you don' t understand !
let me explain !
metal sonic has turned northward and is moving at top speed .
what did you say ?
metal is planning to melt the glaciers to the north !
we must stop him at any cost !
roger !
sonic .
tails , sonic just disappeared .
he must have gone after metal .
he went north !
we' il have to do our best too .
we have to stop metal no matter what !
he' s headed to the north pole .
that means metal has finally found the point of destruction .
here we go , sarah !
no , no !
i don' t want to get married at the north pole !
why me ?
hold on tight , we' re about to hit a warp zone .
no !
i told you to stop !
stop !
all right !
now we have to access metal' s memory banks and adjust them .
then maybe we can awaken sonic' s personality in him !
tails , are you sure we can trust that thing ?
after all , it used to be eggman' s .
don' t worry about it .
just keep your eyes open for sonic .
i know what to do !
oh no , i' m too late .
where' d he go ?
he' s got to be around here somewhere !
what ?
then this will be the real fight .
we' il fight until only one of us is left standing , all right , metal ?
what ?
this world isn' t big enough for the both of us , you say ?
well , the feeling' s mutual .
you might know everything i' m going to do , but i know everything you' re going to do too !
it' s a strange feeling !
sonic , you' re still alive ?
sonic , what' s wrong with you ?
you pervert !
get away , you little piece of tin !
i get it , you synchronized yourself with metal .
this is my chance !
sarah !
sonic !
oh no , my sarah !
that was close !
knuckles !
sonic !
you' re a perfect target for me now , fox !
ready , aim ...
fire eggman missiles !
gotcha !
oh no , another design failure !
that' s all right .
more importantly , what happened to sarah ?
oh man , i can' t stop !
you saved me !
thank you , mr. mole !
somebody stop me please !
i have more power than i thought i did !
there you are sarah .
it' s time for you to come with me now .
look out !
tails !
sorry !
tails , i didn' t think you' d stoop that low .
look , it' s metal !
sonic !
stop it , metal !
if that ice bridge is destroyed , then that' s it for all of us !
knuckles , see what you can do about the magma !
well ...
come on , you' re a real man , aren' t you ?
right !
here we go !
you' re totally cool , mr. mole !
good job , knuckles !
you stopped it !
my hat' s on fire !
hot !
hot !
sonic !
what do you think you' re doing ?
why is this stupid thing that looks like sonic causing so much trouble ?
oh , that' s right !
i hope this works !
no !
if you destroy the land of the sky , then i' il have to marry eggman !
take that !
and that !
and that !
come on !
got it !
now , sonic !
sonic !
good work , tails !
you saved us !
who is that ?
it doesn' t look like eggman .
that' s papa' s rocket !
what did you say ?
what ?
is the door stuck ?
we' re in trouble !
the heat from the lava could cause it to explode !
sarah , you wait here .
come on , let' s go !
papa !
of all the pointless stunts ...
i know .
if that thing explodes right there , we' il all be in trouble .
sonic !
get out of my way , metal !
darn !
sonic !
i' il take care of eggman , and you get the president out of there !
eggman !
trying to overload him by making him assimilate sonic' s personality ?
lmpressive , tails .
but you' re too late .
metal , destroy sonic !
hurry !
hurry !
i know !
shut up !
oh no !
papa !
mr. president !
old man !
sonic !
sonic , are you all right ?
metal ?
don' t do it , sonic !
what are you doing ?
sonic !
grab onto my hand !
don' t do it , sonic !
he' il drag you under with him !
there is only one sonic ...
metal !
don' t do it , sonic !
metal !
come on , don' t look so sad , sonic .
it' s not like you at all .
she' s right !
it was thanks to you that the planet was saved !
eggman !
you' re all fools !
i still have all of sonic' s data !
next time , i' il build a stronger metal that won' t have sonic' s personality .
and then i , eggman , will finally take over the entire planet !
it must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as eggman !
what are you doing ?
stop !
it' s finally over .
thank goodness everything' s all right !
almost , but not quite .
what did you do that for ?
so now we' re finally even , sonic .
what do you mean ?
come back , knuckles !
hey , sonic , wait up !
why' d you hit me ?
i was getting you back for stepping on my head !
i don' t remember doing that !
you did !
i don' t remember !
not so fast !
you' re not going to get away from me !
i' il get your data again , sonic !
what ?
what ?
what are you doing , eggman ?
hurry up and catch sonic !
of course i will !
hang on !
wait , come back !
marry me !
sonic !
sonic , i' il get your data again !
i' m getting out of here !
i' il see you later , knuckles !
hey , wait up , sonic !
