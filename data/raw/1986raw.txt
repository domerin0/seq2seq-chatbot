the dickersons are going .
brake can' t spare you .
ma .
not tomorrow with the cows calving .
the fosters too .
got all the future you need right here .
riding all day with this cramping and all .
don' t you ever act helpless and pitiable to win favor with a man .
some people shouldn' t give advice on how to act with men .
and it' s " pitiful " in english .
you heard what i said .
that pail' s half empty .
i didn' t do it .
it' s that old lndian' s dumb old mule .
what lndian ?
some drifter looking for doctoring .
lf you' re gonna eat barefoot ... ... why not take supper with the animals in the barn .
my boots don' t fit no more .
cut off my blood circulation .
it' s your birthday soon .
i' il have gangrene by then .
your mother may have to saw off your feet , then .
like poor old mr. swenson .
mr. jones .
maggie , this is the visiting gentleman i mentioned .
i' il bet a warm meal sounds pretty good to you .
magdalena .
i' m afraid we have just enough food for family .
we can' t be offering our hospitality tonight .
i' m sure we can all do with less .
i' m sure we can' t !
i have two growing girls to feed .
maggie ?
maggie .
lilly , why don' t you say grace .
who is he ?
called you magdalena .
your hair bristles when you lay eyes on him .
he scares me , is all .
nobody scares you .
can' t trust him .
maggie , who is he ?
he' s my father .
i thought your father was dead .
he is .
to me , he is .
i want him gone , brake .
gone ?
he' s your kin .
you just can' t
he ran off when i wasn' t dot' s age .
went lndian .
turn your back , he' il eat your horses and dogs .
he' s being chased ... ... or running from something , i don' t know what .
but he' s bad , brake .
i swear .
i do not want him near my children .
we' re lndians , lilly .
we' re lndians .
does he do that all night ?
oh , he' s just getting started .
you come here for the healing ?
ln a manner of speaking .
thought you might be hungry .
it' s rabbit stew .
i can' t eat rabbits .
i was bitten by a rattlesnake .
all right .
when there' s company , you sleep in there . ls that right ?
that' s right .
you' re not her husband ?
no , sir .
not for lack of asking .
they your children ?
no .
what happened to their father ?
you don' t know this ?
i can' t say what all happened between you two ... ... but you ain' t welcome here .
but she' s a good christian .
she won' t turn away any man in need .
tomorrow , she' il give you what doctoring she can ... ... then you' re on your way .
there' s places where a father would kill a man ... ... for doing what you' re doing , you know that , don' t you ?
lf you have something to say , say it .
are you really a lndian ?
brake said you rode with the chiricahua .
that' s right .
so that means i' m part lndian , right ?
no .
not at all .
you look stupid trying to work in those fancy clothes , you know .
i am leaving here as soon as i can .
i' m moving to the city .
but grandpa' s visiting .
did you see him ?
he' s a savage .
they' re gut eaters , you know .
i was born into the wrong family , i swear to god i was .
i appreciate this .
take off your shirt .
magdalena  don' t call me that .
it' s not my name .
where' s it hurt ?
hurts when i breathe .
mostly around here .
yeah .
your muscles are torn just under your ribs .
you need to put a cottonwood plaster to it .
you' il live .
i never thought you' d turn out to be a healer .
i remember you had that yellow cat one time .
you cried because a badger bit its tail off .
your mother came running  don' t remember .
not in front of me .
because i remember my mother .
my mother died scrubbing a man' s floor .
and you killed her .
didn' t shoot her or stab her , but what you did ....
you broke her !
and i remember my brother too .
he lasted six years .
i bet you never even knew his name .
and i remember praying hard every night that you' d come home .
on the day i put him in the ground ... ... l remember praying even harder you were dead .
so you don' t want to reminisce with me , that i promise you .
i earned this money in large part ... ... killing mountain lions for ranchers like you .
i want you to have it .
lf i were destitute and drawing my last breath
this is good money .
take it for your children .
take it for your funeral .
magdalena .
i' ve done my duty as a christian .
you get the hell off my ranch !
i' d stop now .
maggie asked you to leave .
i think it' s time you did so , sir .
right about now .
so long .
nice making your acquaintance .
what' s done is done , i guess .
i know you would have done different .
i appreciate your regard , brake .
i do .
well , night , then .
did they see you come in ?
we can' t make a sound .
figure we can get them all branded in a day ?
you want dot to stay for company ?
brake , you said i could go .
you promised .
mama , you promised too .
oh , i' m fine .
he won' t be coming back .
this will help the cramping .
the calves are more important ... ... than hearing your voice come out of a machine .
well , i guess you never had anything but this .
so why should l ?
come on , let' s get going .
you sure look frilly to be working cattle .
i' il keep an eye on them .
just be home before dark .
all right .
all right .
easy now .
that' s right .
dot ?
dot ?
darling ?
get !
get !
dot ?
no !
no !
dot !
oh , lord .
darling .
mama , i' m cold .
i' m here , darling .
are you all right ?
i' m cold .
i' m cold .
mama , i' m cold .
darling , where' s lilly ?
emiliano .
yeah , i know .
darling , where' s lilly ?
emiliano and me ... ... we was in the arroyo .
we heard shots from where brake and lilly was .
he told me , " stay down " ... ... emiliano did .
don' t move .
stay down .
he went to see ... ... but he didn' t come back .
i waited like he said , but he didn' t come back .
brake was screaming , mama .
he screamed so long i wanted him to stop .
i know .
i know it .
i know it .
then he did .
then someone rode away with lilly .
i wanted him to stop !
i know it .
i know it .
darling , did you see who ?
who took your sister ?
he wore a hood .
he was lndian .
i' m sorry for your loss , ma' am , but i' m afraid you got the wrong fella in mind .
i' ve had the man you' re describing in jail since last night .
sold himself a lion' s hide and got quite a drunk on .
unacceptable drunk .
he did say he was staying out by your place , though .
there' s been raids like this on people here lately ... ... in arizona and new mexico .
some apaches jumped the reservation at san carlos middle of last month .
we' ve been getting communications about them near every day .
to fort bowie .
from me .
possible your hostiles attacked local ranch .
two dead , one girl missing .
named ....
lilly gilkeson .
lilly gilkeson .
stop .
this takes just a moment .
the device is truly a miracle .
and now you' il hear your voice back as clear as day .
ladies .
my name' s louise dewey .
my name' s louise dewey .
to sheriff purdy ... ... of chloride .
believe hostiles ... ... headed northwest ... ... toward colorado river .
fourth cavalry ... ... will pursue ... ... in due course .
well , there you have it .
i' il send the undertaker out ...
... for the remains .
you' re not going after them ?
not under the present circumstances , ma' am .
with the fair in town , i need all the men i have right here .
lf you don' t follow now , their trail will get cold .
the army is handling the situation .
they have apache scouts .
takes an apache to catch an apache .
lf someone doesn' t go now , my daughter may be dead .
ma' am , i am elected to keep vigil over this town of ours .
just one or two men , sir , that' s all i' m asking .
ma' am , i am sorry .
seth , i need a word with you .
it was the lndians did it .
now , ladies , i will not authorize fireworks until a water wagon is here .
ma' am , that' s the drunkard from last night .
what would you like me to do with him ?
let him go .
i don' t care .
mama ?
darling .
i want you to ride to the handys ' ...
no .
no , i won' t . ... and stay there till i get back .
i won' t stay behind .
i' il follow you as soon as you' re gone , you know i will .
darling  i' m not you can' t leave me , ma .
i' m going with you , mama , please , i am .
now , you hear me , dot  i' m not staying behind .
wherever you put me , i' m coming after you , ma .
you know i' m not gonna stay put .
i swear to god , i won' t stay put .
hush , hush .
hush , now .
it' s all right .
hush .
the army' s headed in the wrong direction .
seventeen horse tracks .
three shod , one outrider , two cavalry horses .
six horses were tied together ... ... carrying light loads .
probably young women , children .
and their captives ... ... those are being led along ... ... like packhorses .
they' re headed south .
not north .
probably trying to make it to the mexican border .
the apaches sell a lot of girls over there .
top dollar .
can you track them ?
you can track them .
but if you catch them , you' il wish you' d stayed home .
i don' t wanna catch them .
keep me on the trail till i get the army down to fort selden to catch them .
you wanted to give me money .
do this instead .
taking this child out there is foolish .
i know my daughter .
leave her behind , she' il just follow .
no way to care for a girl .
what would you know about any of it ?
i' il be just fine , thank you .
come on , now .
pretty moon , anne .
old bob hadley was supposed to stop by tonight .
god .
mama , i' m afraid in my room .
it' s just your fever giving you bad dreams , honey .
you want mama to sing you a song ?
your man didn' t keep his rifle very clean .
lf he wanted to marry you , though , i guess that' s something .
he' s not all bad .
did you ever marry ?
dot' s father was my husband .
he built the ranch with me .
the notion of it was better than the doing , i guess .
what about the other one' s father ?
didn' t get much of a look at him .
maggie ?
what you' re doing , you' re doing for your own soul .
because what you' ve done , you can' t undo .
you can all move now .
sir ... ... do you suppose it' s safe for me to be on my way now ?
mister , i don' t suppose nothing .
you' re theirs now .
they captured you .
could you help me , please ?
go into the cave .
bring picture maker .
go !
take them .
you' re heartless .
i see you gentlemen are engaging in a little frontier recreation out here .
no , these girls are going to market .
we ain' t supposed to sully the merchandise .
i can smell him from here .
i see you share a fondness for the photographic arts like myself .
where did you find this squashed penis ?
we captured him as a gift for you .
sir , may i have the honor of posing you with your captives , please ?
he wants to take your picture .
please , please .
that' s perfect .
now ...
... very still .
help us .
help .
please help us .
look your best .
lord , protect us .
stay behind me .
lndians .
yeah .
but not the way you' re thinking .
ls there time enough to give these men a proper christian burial ?
dead' s dead , one way or the other .
i asked if there was time .
yeah .
there' s time .
get in .
you must be the pride of your people .
and you of yours .
prepare to dismount !
dismount !
the two on the porch have expired , lieutenant .
ask him why he murdered those men .
i didn' t murder anybody .
they were dead when i got here .
what are you doing in here ?
my granddaughter was stolen two days ago .
i trailed her to this place .
what' s her name ?
you don' t know your granddaughter' s name ?
well , her sister' s name is dot .
we found two horses with a bunch of women' s property in them .
hang him .
other side !
there he goes !
i didn' t kill anyone !
i said , i didn' t kill anyone !
come out and show your hands !
i am looking for my granddaughter !
then you tell me her damn name !
i don' t know her damn name !
lilly !
lilly gilkeson .
you know this lndian ?
he' s no lndian .
damn well looks lndian to me .
no , he' s a ....
that' s my father .
i' ve been hoping we' d find you , sir .
we need your help .
we tracked my daughter south from chloride .
they' re heading toward mexico .
near as we can figure ... ... they' ve hit six or seven homesteads so far , including this one .
army should' ve killed the heathens when they had a chance .
they are army , ma' am .
deserters .
why , i thought they were apache .
apache scouts .
formerly on uncle sam' s payroll .
like happy jim here .
we use them to hunt other apaches .
the lndians were american soldiers ?
then a couple of months ago , some of them turned ... ... shot some white officers and jumped the reservation in san carlos .
the 4th cavalry started all this by hanging their chief .
don' t know what they were thinking .
what makes you think they were thinking ?
this whole territory' s gone topsy turvy .
you got lndians running with whites , whites running with lndians .
get those prisoners moving !
come on , squaw man .
get on the way here .
happy jim .
you think because you' re wearing that coat they won' t put you on the prison train to florida with chains on your legs ?
i don' t know of florida .
it' s a real swell shit hole of a swamp .
you' il see .
white man , you don' t look like someone who gives good advice .
break it up !
what' s going on here ?
i said , break it up .
i found it first , lieutenant .
lying bastard !
looks like god intended you two to share .
any man found looting ... ... will have the value of their property deducted from his pay .
they' re enlisted men .
post two men over there .
i' m going to camp down by the river .
lf i stay here long , i might misbehave . right over there .
somebody might have to kill me .
lieutenant ?
i imagine you plan to ride first thing .
would it be all right if my daughter and i rode along with you ?
naturally , i' m quite concerned .
ma' am , capturing those renegades is the army' s highest priority .
yes , of course .
butcher a couple goats for supper !
and i' m grateful .
but that' s the assignment of the 4th .
but the 4th is going in the wrong direction .
i assure you , they' il be redirected as soon as we reach fort stanton .
stanton' s three days away .
my daughter will be in mexico by then .
i grieve for your situation , i truly do .
but my assignment is to return these hostiles in my capture to stanton ... ... for their prompt and immediate deportation .
you like fish ?
go water the horses .
i watered them back at the  i' m not asking .
don' t make them too raw , please .
very well , ma' am .
lilly , she' s ... ... not the same as dot .
she' s not strong .
she gets hurt so easy .
sage ?
what ?
for the fish .
i know i asked you to get us to the army
i asked you if you wanted some sage put on your fish .
yeah .
all right .
none for dot .
we' il ride at first light in the morning .
lf we can catch up to them , i might have enough money to buy her back .
lf they make it to mexico ... ... your child is lost .
hey , that stuff will make you sick , but i like it .
no , no , no , no .
whoa .
that flash behind her head bother you ?
it' s just
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa .
there' s no magic .
it' s an optical defect .
a flaw .
a flaw .
flaw .
wait , wait .
hey , wait .
look at these .
look at these .
see ?
i know where all the prettiest girls live , from arizona to texas .
you pick the ones you want , and i' il take you right to them .
look !
all the pretty girls , see ?
all of them !
i' il take you look !
take your bad luck to your grave .
what was that ?
what did you just do ?
i' il get it done .
who of you can skin a deer ?
hey !
who of you can skin a deer ?

i can' t see .
what is happening to me ?
somebody tell me .
what is happening ?
i can' t see .
i can' t see .

where' s clubfoot going ?
i thought we was dropping back down into mexico .
seven' s an unlucky number for him .
he wants eight girls .

my grandmother ?
no .
mama !
mama !
dot ?
you all right ?
you get bit ?
did those snakes bite you ?
no .
mama , a dead man' s in there .
don' t worry about that child .
go on now .
mama , look at his eyes .
what happened to him ?
he lost control of his wagon .
maybe he had a heart seizure .
he didn' t have a heart seizure .
his heart' s in that hole .
what' s behind her head ?
some people would think it' s a sign .
a good sign or bad sign ?
it wasn' t a very good sign for him .
come here .
what are you doing ?
these are for protection .
the man who did this is a brujo .
a what ?
it' s a witch .
you need to wear one too .
you can believe in your witchcraft and your impiety all you want .
i believe in what i' ve seen , girl .
snakes belong on the ground .
this one hangs them in the air .
a man' s heart holds his spirit .
this one digs it out and throws it in the dirt .
don' t you start this .
i know a brujo who' d put an arrow in you a mile away .
i know a brujo who laid his hand on a child one time .
one time .
the child cramped up , fell down and spit up bees till she died .
you stop this .
you' re scaring her .
she needs to be scared .
so do you .
mama , please .
please .
just on her .
we gotta get through that canyon before the storm hits .
you go on and i' il follow .
give me some of the medical stuff they stole , the laudanum .
you like that stuff .
you know , i drink enough of this stuff , i swear ...
... you start to look good to me .
hey .
they give this to my grandma when she was fixing to croak .
mama !
mama !
i' il get her !
get those horses to higher ground !
i' ve got her !
dot , you hold on to me !
my foot' s caught !
hold your breath !
right now !
gotta piss .
sit up .
i can get us out of here .
do you hear that ?
you mustn' t speak .
my baby' s calling me .
no .
i' m sorry .
i' m so sorry .
your baby' s passed on .
no .
that' s just how she sleeps .
there' s nothing you can do , so please just
there , there .
my baby .
here .
watch out while i get the horses .
hey .
just going to get those berries i promised you .
don' t wander off .
lord , forgive me .
stop squirming .
goddamn you !

get up !
no !

tie her legs !
shut up !
shut up !
why ?
now we' re gonna be back to seven , and seven' s an unlucky number .
whore !
stop !
thank you .
crawl .
you' re better than them , but you' re not better than me .
can she have the moccasins now ?
yeah .
can i just ?
i' m glad you were here .
i was bitten by a rattlesnake .
what ?
a good shaman gave me two amulets .
told me not to eat rabbit meat for a year ... ... to say my prayers every morning ... ... take care of my family , and i might get well .
you' re telling me the only reason you came back ... ... was because you were following the say so of some ... ... medicine man . ls that right ?
yes .
absolutely .
a rattlesnake can make your soul ...
... very sick .
that' s likely not what you want to hear .
but it is the truth .
we have eight girls .
now , we can go .
