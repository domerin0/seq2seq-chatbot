claudia , calm down ...
i am calm , but in a while i' il start to snore .
snore , it' s a sign of inner peace .
are we making a commercial for sheets or sedatives ?
for sedative sheets .
very nice , now i want you to touch yourself .
very nice ...

we are making love ...

mum !
mum !
where is mum ?
in the bathroom .
it' s her' s now .
my wife killed herself .
i tried to stop her and she shot me in the arm ...
hurry up , please .
she is on the 20th kilometer , make a right , at the villa " gioukali " .
the name is in honor of curt vail , a musician .
it doesn t matter though .
please hurry up .
she left this note for you .
my dear ramon , i am leaving ...
you will never understand me , and i hope you never do ... " " because it would mean that you are as desperate as i am
help me stop the bleeding .
i am still alive .
after three years
nice , anna .
lower your head , open your eyes ...
we took out one eyelash so you can see the difference .
eyelashes make the eyes look bigger make them expressive .
you can not compare a woman with shiny eyes ... with one with her eyes down .
even with an ugly one , with eyelashes she shines .
let' s hear it for the eyelashes , girls !
the marchioness called you have to do her mother' s makeup .
you mean the diseased ?
she wants the corps to look beautiful for the funeral .
i can' t .
i have the stepfather of ramon today .
you live in your little world send one of the other girls .
please someone should go .
i promised .
good bye
i don' t understand why you give promises before we have agreed .
bye
paka , can you do the marchioness' s mother makeup ?
mari should go .
why me ?
they are sending you .
i can' t .
i am scared i am trembling from fear .
you should go together .
i don' t do dead people' s makeup
i once had done a dead man' s makeup and i had made him gorgeous .
two years ago , i was working for the television , with abaro .
i had taken over nicholas , an american writer .
we are ready .
a little powder ...
do you want anything else ?
no thank you .
will you sign an autograph for me ?
my name is kika .
you need to study more
with us today , we have nicholas peers , an american writer ... that just released his first novel in spanish .
it is entitled " i fell in love with a crook " .
did i read it correctly ?
peers .
i don' t do well with foreign names .
take a sausage .
no thanks .
they taste really good .
how long have you lived in spain ?
four years .
i came to do a hunting documentary .
i work with american magazines .
i write about traveling .
but i liked your country and mainly my wife .
you won' t find another place like spain .
in the book' s prologue you respond to malicious voices that it' s not an autobiography .
i accept , though , there are many elements from my life .
that' s what i meant .
your wife , for instance , died the same way the one in your book did .
and her husband is a writer as you .
many writers have killed their wives .
i didn' t know .
barrows , for instance , shot her . and altuser strangled her .
horrible !
fortunately i don' t know them .
they are not from spain , right ?
but would you kill your wife ?
they suspected me though ...
people are nasty .
exactly these suspicions gave me the reason for this book .
i wondered if i had killed my wife ... how would i deceive the law ?
the result of this is this book .
i am not going to read this book . because i don' t see well .
i have a problem with my eyesight .
but i will give it as a gift to my grand children .
thank you
so ending , what are your plans about the future ?
i will soon go to south america i have to write some articles there .
have a nice trip , and good luck ... find a woman to marry .. because you are still young .
i will follow your advice .
i am a widow too .
you can not imagine how bad it feels to be alone .
the dark days , the never ending nights ...
that' s why i am here .
it' s my son s program .
he invited me and because i don' t see him much , i came .
ms pakita is a great person .
i wish my mother were like her .
i would like to have him over there as a father .
even though abaro was chasing him , finally it was me that got him .
we hit it off ... and we arranged to meet some other day .
it was cold and i was wearing a coat , an acrylic orange one .
hi nicholas .
thanks for coming .
aren' t you glad to see me ?
my son died yesterday night .
i am so sorry .
i didn' t know you had a son .
he was my wife' s son .
a stepson .
i invited you to do his makeup before he begins to disintegrate .
i thought you called me for another reason .
how could i imagine i would do a dead man' s make up ?
you will do great .
does he have any wounds ? cause if he does i can' t stand it .
he died of a heart attack .
he had to die during christmas !
poor guy ...
what is this ?
my son is a photographer .
he is great with collage .
what a beautiful corpse !
what is his name ?
ramon
he is frozen .
i will freeze too .
soon he will start to turn green .
try to make him not to look so pale for the funeral .
don' t worry .
i will give him his natural colour .
good , i am leaving .
i see you like women .
i wish i had met you .
you would have fallen in love with me .
and i would have definitely fallen in love with you .
you can not imagine what i' ve been through , ramon .
all the crazy people want me .
and i fall in love with them , because that' s how i am .
if they have a good soul and a nice " tool " i fall in love with them .
your stepfather is a fine type too he is weird though .
very strange , but in bed he is really the best .
today he called me and i thought we were going to have sex .
and now i am doing makeup on a dead guy but never mind because i like you .
i just want to know if i am going to have sex today or not .
i don' t see you having a funeral here .
where is the family ?
i don' t see a funeral aura .
these are too american ...
he is warm !
what is going on ?
he blushed .
this isn' t possible .
he is allergic to makeup .
dead people don' t have allergies .
i swear he changed color .
do you see his color ?
it' s because of the make up .
i just did this spot .
continue , i' il be here , next to you .
he is alive !
are you feeling better ?
much better .
what happened ?
how are you doing ?
fine , you ?
let me help you .
what have you been doing all this time ?
i had some business .
can you lend me some money ?
i don' t even have for the hotel
i could stay in the gioukali villa , but i need a car .
the villa is a mess .
i will give you money
i will give it back .
what are you doing in madrid ?
i' il work , what else ?
i will write a novel about latin america .
how is your heart ?
are you taking it slow ?
i am fine .
i am glad .
i am sorry i' m late what happened ?
you are amazing .
i have no worries .
that' s why i look like this .
a woman shot herself because they denied her of a loan .
a court member of seville is accused of embezzlements .
huana t. was a victim of sexual harassment .
a famous politician kills his wife and then kills himself .
they had an argument about their daughter s grades .
his neighbors said he was a great man .
a young girl rapist committed suicide in prison out of shame because he had been raped in jail .
mogia was convicted for prostitution of mentally handicapped people .
five anarchists killed two people from morocco and one form dominica .
a porno gang was arrested today at the children' s care station , prosperity
they were forcing six year olds to film hard core porn .
the police is searching for the child killer x. garthia also known as portuguese .
good evening ladies and gentlemen .
with you ms a scarred .
presenting you the worst of the day .
now i would like to show you some footage i like .
be careful though cause they can upset sensitive people , if any still exist .
why did your daughter kill herself ?
leave me alone .
how was the environment ?
it was a living hell , and my husband is to blame .
he assaulted her sexually .
did you go to the police ?
we just want our peace .
we are separated now ..
what are you doing here ?
although all the efforts done by the police ...
huakin still runs free ...
our sponsor , " la real " milk ... offers 10 million pesetas to whoever helps to his whereabouts .
please do not call in unless you are sure .
and since we can' t talk with huakin ...
let' s talk with the one that raised him , his mother .
she deserves it .
good evening .
are you nervous ?
your son killed his wife and raped his daughter .
when he was little did he want to kill you or rape you ?
he was just a little naughty .
but i never expected him to end like this .
he hasn' t done this .
but it has been confirmed .
i don' t believe it .
your dead daughter in law wouldn' t agree with you .
my dear ramon , i am leaving ...
you will never understand me , and i hope you never do ... " " because it would mean that you are as desperate as i am
it' s not nicholas ' fault .
my life with him was unbearable , but i deserved it " .
forgive me for not giving you the time i wanted ... " " but pain makes you selfish " .
i wonder if mum wanted me to support nicholas .
definitely she wouldn' t want you to hold a grudge at him .
he can not even afford the hotel .
would you mind if he stayed at the loft for a little while ?
why would i mind ?
what will happen with your laboratory ?
i will rent a room .
that' s a good idea .
what' s this ?
if it bothers you , i' il take it .
i like it .
this is your room .
it' s not much .
i' ve seen worse .
we have to talk about the villa .
it' s all i got .
half of it you mean .
you don' t need it , right ?
do you agree to sell it ?
let me think about it .
if you only knew what' s worth ....
for me this house reminds me of other things .
not money .
i don' t have the luxury to be sentimental .
i' m not rich .
what do you want ?
it' s andrea .
i took you for an alien .
it doesn' t surprise me .
come in .
what are you doing here ?
i came for the ad .
are you going to buy the house ?
i can' t afford it .
i am looking for a similar house to do some takes .
i am not a psychologist any more .
i am doing a show in tv now .
even now i have to deal with crazy people .
can i film a little ?
do whatever you like but does ramon agree about this ?
have you seen him again ?
the only thing left of him is this scar .
we are doing a film about a couple that buried 10 people in their garden .
there is enough space here .
do you want to see the first episode ?
i have it with me .
read it .
it' s fantastic .
i' il take a look .
the place is perfect .
what did you think of the script ?
it s awful .
do you want to write it ?
i' ve never written for tv .
but you are a writer .
my spanish is not so good .
we will translate it .
don' t tell ramon anything .
don' t worry .
what are you doing here ?
i want to rent the house .
it' s for sale , not for rent .
i thought that until you sell it you would somehow take advantage of it .
you were wrong ...
good bye andrea .
will you escort me ?
i want to talk to you .
you know the way .
bye nicholas .
it was nice to see you .
when is she going to leave me alone ?
you shouldn' t have behaved like that .
i never treated her badly .
i just avoided her .
she says you did that scar on her .
she did it herself .
she was cutting herself so that i wouldn' t leave .
interesting girl .
ramon it' s a quarter past .
you won' t make it .
did you see my top ?
i can' t go out like this .
i am easy , but not that easy .
it' s here , i found it .
your pills .
i have to leave immediately .
i have three shows .
the top models want me .
i have a gift for you .
how nice !
you shouldn' t have .
today it' s our second year anniversary .
i am sorry , i don' t even know what day it is .
i want us to get married .
don' t you ?
it' s not that .
ain' t i a bit old for you ?
i like older women .
and immature for my age ?
i like immature women .
then go on .
i liked it .
can we have dinner tonight ?
and anything else you fancy !
abaro , what are you doing here ?
i came to have breakfast with you .
is that why you dressed up like this ?
do you find me provocative ?
if they ask you what' s the going rate don' t be surprised .
i am not getting angry , cause you don' t mean any harm .
you are just jealous .
i came to see you cause i' m worried about you .
i can tell .
i know you .
i think ramon suspects something .
he asked me to marry him .
this is amazing !
it' s strange though , cause we are presently going through a crisis .
it' s fantastic .
do you know many people getting married after having lived together for two years ?
it' s sweet , but is he perhaps suspecting something ?
it' s better this way .
you should listen to me i know better .
if you have a problem with ramon the stepfather is not a solution .
but you said nicholas fucks better .
for your information , ramon performs equally well .
then what' s the problem ?
just stop the bullshit and marry him .
it' s all so simple for you .
he is rich too .
i think he is going to nick' s apartment .
suzanna , what are you doing here ?
i thought it was the postman .
won' t you invite me in ?
i' ve been looking for you for months .
how did you find me ?
sheer luck .
i saw you in a show .
i didn t even know your name .
i only knew a few things about you .
you owe me some explanations .
as you wish .
come on in .
thank you .
did ramon come by ?
then i m going upstairs don' t look at me this way .
huana , it' s not right i can' t help it .
it' s not a shame to like men .
huana , why don' t you shave the moustache ?
why ?
is the moustache a man only privilege ?
men with a moustache are either gay fascists or both .
i tell you this as a professional you would look a lot better without a moustache .
one day i will do your makeup and you' il see .
well i am going upstairs ...
she is really out of it .
but she is so coquettish .
it' s kika .
are you there ?
i am calling because your son asked me to marry him .
i want us to talk about it .
so you are not there ?
see you tomorrow then .
we are done .
look huana you look great .
do you like me better this way ?
there is no comparison .
if you weren' t so skinny you could be a model .
i don' t like the catwalk .
i wish i were a prison governor .
to be able to watch women all day .
you are really something .
what' s going on ?
you are driving me crazy .
i' il throw some water on me to calm down ...
have you ever been with a man ?
just with my brother .
my brother is retarded , poor kid .
all weirdoes like to fuck .
when he was little he used to fuck cows , goats and sheep .
then he raped the women neighbors so i let him have his way .
this is awful !
you have been sentimentally traumatized .
no big deal !
there is always a way .
you are really something !
i am unique , mum .
pay her a compliment .
you look great .
my lady changed me .
in a few days nicholas will go to the villa .
it will be better for him there the place is ideal for writing .
but he' il be all alone .
tell me the truth .
do you want to drive him away ?
since you ask , yes .
i can' t forgive him .
about your mother ?
you shouldn' t suffer like this .
i stayed an orphan too , but i don' t think about it all the time .
it' s not the same .
thanks a lot .
you were little when they died .
isn' t that enough ?
you don' t understand me .
i am trying , but you are not talking to me .
couples after a while start to act alike .
we on the contrary do not .
you are shutting yourself more and more .
i read somewhere that people that shut themselves , are oppressed .
they hide their desires and eventually die of cancer .
do you know what cancer means ?
enough !
so you are not letting me speak any more ?
you are not letting me .
so speak .
what should i say ?
there are things i don' t talk about like sarajevo or somalia .
speak about us .
didn' t i come so that we could celebrate ?
i forgot about it . somebody should stop me .
you have to stop me .
it' s good luck .
put a little behind your ear .
to us !
we will love each other no matter what happens .
it' s better that nothing happens .
this week the popular series " the bloody customs " ... presents the famous religious ceremony " people in love " .
this must hurt .
horrible .
even huana was impressed .
among the disguised is pablo mendez . also known as paul batho .
you remember " rambo therapy " ... and " make love , not filth " ?
this is the notorious paul batho , fugitive porn star .
he took a leave of absence from the prison authorities ... to pay a tribute to holy mary .
and he escaped disguised .
we hope that the freedom of the famous porn star .. doesn' t last long .
let' s do it the way i like it .
forget about it .
do it as a gift to me !
i gave you one .
i' ve spoiled you .
you know i don' t care ... but we should do it once in a while and in a normal manner .
look at me .
should i continue ?
shoot while i do my thing .
again , but try not to shake it .
you should stay still then so i can shoot !
you don' t look natural like this ..
what' s wrong ?
you don' t like it ?
i am not into photos .
focus .
no more photos .
i am focusing ...
the lamp is shaking !
if you want we can stop .
don' t you mind ?
don' t be angry .
we made so many photos .
if you never return to the beloved woods ... that are sad and cold .
at least don' t forget to shed a light ... to my mist .
because with your loss , the moonlight has vanished .
because with your loss ... the moonlight vanished !
are you there nicholas ?
it' s andrea .
pick up .
i know you' re there .
i hate people that say " i know you' re there
me too .
am i bothering you ?
yes , what do you want ?
instead of sending me the first three episodes ... you sent me something else entitled " the lesbian killer
i mixed up the envelopes .
wait .
i have yours .
will you send it to me tomorrow ?
if you want i can send it now .
tomorrow i have to move to gioukali .
so should i come now ?
in half an hour .
is it ok ?
lets make it in one hour .
ok , bye .
to kill is like cutting your toenails .
in the beginning you are bored and you postpone it but once you start ... you discover it can be done a lot faster than you thought .
and although you believe it will be a while till you cut them again ... without you realizing it , they have grown long again .
i don' t think you can describe better the passion to kill someone .
but these are said by a woman .
all women take care of themselves .
you are right .
you shouldn' t delay any further .
you have to finish it .
we have to translate it .
i promise i will work hard in the cottage house .
are they real facts ?
they are cases that haven' t been solved .
their only common element is the lack of motive .
i bet it' s not the same killer .
i wrote it this way .
i wanted it to be interesting .
it' s an amazing story .
today a gorgeous woman came by asking about you .
you should know her .
she came later by my house .
you should be more discrete and not give my home address .
she was beautiful and i thought that you would like her .
if i want to find a woman i can do it on my own .
i am sorry .
did she give you a hard time ?
no but it took me an hour to get rid of her .
he took advantage of the opportunity to escape .
who are you and what do you want ?
it' s me , pablo .
i escaped .
why did you come here ?
you are my sister , aren' t you ?
i told you not to escape .
i can' t stand the prison .
and what do you want from me ?
can i stay with you ?
are you mad ?
they will turn us in to the police .
give me some money .
i haven t got any more .
steal something .
the chair ?
what would you do with it ?
you told me to .
don' t be stupid .
gag me and tie me to the office .
take whatever you can .
there is a vcr , and cameras .
what did i just tell you ?
to steal something .
from the studio on the right !
stupid !
put them in this bag i will send them later .
you will go to our cousin .
she will hide you for a few days .
stop eating !
but i haven' t eaten anything all day .
if you were in prison you would eat .
there is no better place .
it has no women .
it has gays though .
is it the same ?
you want everything your way .
tie me up .
and hit me .
hit you ?
do you fancy it ?
what an ass !
so that they don' t suspect you , moron !
you are brilliant .
and you are a jackass .
tie me up .
gag me with the towel !
don' t make so much noise my lady is sleeping inside the other room .
is there a woman here ?
you are horny .
then fuck me one time to calm down .
two times .
and one time with the cousin and her little one .
leave her alone . or i' il call the police .
gag me with the towel and punch me .
haven' t you learned anything in prison ?
shut up juanita .
for christ sake , hit me !
ready ?
nice ...
look .
do you like it ?
this hurts .
i was nice to her .
i didn' t rape her .
you promised two times .
don' t play around .
have it your way .
that' s me !
what are you doing ?
i am fucking you .
don' t yell !
she won' t answer !
did you kill her ?
she is tied up , gagged and unconscious in the kitchen .
stay still !
what do you prefer ?
me to fuck you or slit your throat ?
open your legs !
mind the knife !
are you paul batho ?
the famous porn star .
i am kika .
mind the knife what you are doing is not nice .
what do you mean ?
i am the best !
everyone said so !
we are not making a movie though !
this is real rape .
i suspect you have problems .
no problem .
but you are a fugitive .
i know !
can' t we put this aside and talk about your problems ?
i am understanding .
discrete .
i won' t tell a soul .
you are drooling all over me !
i am talking to you !
let me go !
police ...

he is probably lying .
why don' t we go for a ride then and we' il see tomorrow morning .
i am not in the mood today .
time goes by so fast .
have you noticed ?
should i put collagen in my lips ?
i' ve done everything else .

in america this dimple is priceless .
i didn' t leave it like this though .
me and mr. douglas have it .
you are giving me a headache .
let' s go get us a rapist .
two orgasms are not enough for you ?
my record is four .
today i am going to break it .
and you have to do it with me ?
it' s one thing to be a rapist and another to do this .
we have been here all day and i can not even go to the toilet .
let go of the knife .
behave yourself .
i hope you won' t pass me any disease from jail .
you don' t even use a condom although you should .
i have gotten bored of your dick , you know that ?
you beast , let go of my lady !
go back to the kitchen !
don' t go to the kitchen .
i see you !
do you want me to kill you ?
there is nothing we can do !
just let him cum .
he' s done that already twice and he didn' t even take it out .
it' s paul batho the porn star .
i see !
we got ourselves a professional her !
are you listening paul ?
she is talking to you are you going to have us like this all day ?
you cum one more time and then you leave we are not going to say anything .
you cum and you leave .
did you hear me ?
cum ....
cum !
that' s all we needed .
who is it ?
don' t open whoever it is .
how can i open tied up like this ?
call for help .
i am gagged too .
do something !
as if this wasn t enough do you want people to see us as well ?
cum , for god sake !
there is no one here .
wait .
i hear something .
something is wrong !
open up , police !
open this door immediately !
don' t shoot , mario !
don' t go in !
you don' t know who can be inside !
cover me !
was it you they raped ?
i don' t know , maybe .
i took a punch and i fainted .
how many were there ?
i only opened the door to one .
don' t you know that you should only open the door for the police ?
he was disguised .
what could i do ?
should i call for backup ?
i am going in .
cover me !
what if they' re armed ?
we are armed too .
in the bedroom !
it could be a trap .
i am sorry , but i can' t wait for you to cum .
this is suicide !
i don' t care about anything anymore .
police !
let this woman go now !
can' t you see i' m pointing a gun at you , you imbecile ?
do as he says .
he is crazy !
if i pull the trigger i am going to paint this room with your brains !
he doesn' t move .
don' t you think you' re taking it too far paul ?
one ...
two ...
three ...
where are you going punk ?
come here !
do you want me to drive you somewhere with my bike ?
quickly , give me the keys !
stupid !
how could you let him go ?
we thought that he would kill himself .
you are not getting paid to think , but to be sure .
who called you ?
i called myself .
if i would wait for you ...
i thought it was a prank .
how did you know ?
a voyeur called in .
what was paul doing upstairs ?
nothing .
he was raping a woman .
so that' s nothing for you ?
you pig ?
this girl could need me .
so you open the door to a disguised man and you can' t describe him .
then you are in the kitchen .
what happened from the door till the kitchen ?
i suppose he was dragging me . by the hair !
your hair looks intact .
i was unconscious .
what a pleasant surprise !
where is the victim ?
in the bathroom .
who are you ?
the maid .
find me the motorbike and paul alive !
did he rape you ?
he hit me and i fainted .
she is hiding something .
you have scars .
he tied me up and gagged me .
we will talk later doll .
mustard color .
light brown .
where is the bathroom ?
there .
shall i take you ?
what are you doing here ?
my job .
we were told you were raped .
how can i not mind ?
show the lady out , constable .
you hurt , i am sorry .
as a psychologist i may be able to help so tell me .
if she doesn' t leave i am going to sue you for trespassing on private property .
you are being unfair .
he just saved you .
that' s true .
don' t be like that .
you are intolerable .
leave us alone .
i feel uncomfortable too .
how can you explain that he came straight to you after his escape ?
did you know him ?
how did he treat you during the rape ?
did he threaten you ?
how many time did he cum ?
did you have an orgasm ?
will you be able to get over it ?
is it the judge s fault ?
was the escape perhaps a political plan of the opposition ?
your behavior is against freedom of expression .
i hate this room .
the voyeur s address ?
mario has it .
it s fake .
you are an obstacle to my divine plans but you won t get away with it pretty .
don' t feel guilty huana .
it' s my fault for opening the door .
it' s not your fault .
have a drink and calm down .
and one for me too .
i would give my life for you .
i know .
i' il be upstairs for a while .
nice protection he gave us from upstairs !
how dare you ?
you didn' t do a great job either .
don' t say an other word .
we came for the door .
what happened ?
shooting ?
you know the police ...
they can' t aim .
what are you doing here ?
i came to see nicholas , but he won' t open .
he is probably not inside .
what do you want him for , so late ?
i have a confession to make .
nicholas and me are seeing each other .
i wanted to tell you , but i couldn' t find the right moment .
but we see each other every day !
don' t shout , he' s going to hear us .
let him hear us !
yesterday that you were half naked , you were coming out of there , weren' t you ?
you lied to your kika ?
don' t speak to me about lies cause you don' t tell the truth to ramon either .
ramon is a man , but you are my best friend .
you are right .
at least when you go at it , close the windows .
what do you mean ?
yesterday you were screaming like mad .
from what i can remember , nobody touched me yesterday .
but i could hear you from the terrace .
it must have been someone else .
yesterday when i called him he said he was busy .
he is cheating on us .
you mean cheating on you .
i can' t compete anymore .
you tell him that !
how are you doing ambaro ?
hi ramon .
goodbye ramon .
what' s wrong ?
nothing .
we were fighting .
what' s going on here ?
we are changing the door .
the police broke it down .
why didn' t they ring the bell instead of breaking doors down ?
do you want a drink ?
you are going to need it .
i don' t want .
police did ring the bell but we didn' t answer ...
huana was tied up in the kitchen ... and i was being raped .
it was awful but it' s over now .
i' d rather forget about it .
i don' t understand .
these things happen .
bad luck .
who was the rapist ?
do you remember paul batho that escaped yesterday during a religious ceremony ?
he came here disguised and she let him in .
i was asleep .
how could i imagine ?
when i woke up he was already inside .
inside the kitchen ?
no , inside me .
are you wondering about the police ?
in such times ...
it was strange for me too .
a voyeur called them !
so are they spying on us too ?
can you imagine who it is ?
these are strange people !
they don' t want to reveal themselves .
did they steal my cameras ?
he meant to take them , but with the rape he forgot about them .
he raped me three times and all you can think is your cameras !
how come he raped you three times ?
the cops would have raped me three more if i had been absent minded .
i had a fight with huana and ambaro .
forget about it .
worst of the day
can we change the channel ?
it' s not a good day for any more disasters .
i want to see her .
she learned about the rape and came here to get an interview .
andrea ?
yes , you know her ?
she used to be a psychologist .
who , this mad woman ?
i used to be her patient .
my mother wanted me to .
it was the worst .
how come you never told me ?
it just didn' t happen .
did you give her an interview ?
i sent her away .
so you know her ?
i ve still got a lot to learn about you .
some other time ...
huana , bring some ice .
stop drinking !
we are not celebrating !
of course we are .
good evening , ladies and gentlemen .
with you, it s a. scarred .
the ice .
i am sorry about before .
have a seat .
today we have an exclusive story .
paul batho , the escape porn star . raped a girl .
out of respect we won' t reveal her identity .
listen ...
be optimistic .
there are worse things ...
it s a memo form our sponsor , children' s milk " real " .
i' il show her .
i' il give her something to remember .
we just helped so that she could have her rates up .
she made a fool of me in public .
i don' t get you ramon .
it' s reme .
did you watch the tv ?
what a disgrace !
what ever did you think when you sent him over ?
don' t worry .
i am coming .
did you watch the tv ?
it' s you we didn' t see all day .
i was busy .
me too , but i came by your house .
why don' t we talk when ramon is away ?
we have nothing more to say .
enough !
aren' t you even curious about the gunshots fired ?
why did you let her drink ?
i don' t need permission .
so the issue is me being drunk ?
you are not solving anything this way .
don' t drink any more .
mind your business , i am a saint .
i am not in the mood !
enough !
i am sorry .
i am falling apart .
what do you take me for ?
lie down and forgive me .
don' t touch me .
i' il sue her for this .
we should better forget all about it .
i don' t forget anything .
i can' t be raped so that more milk can be sold !
have it your way .
i am going to show nicholas off and i' il be back .
we have had sex many times with nicholas .
don' t you have anything to say ?
what do you want me to say ?
at least now you know .
the police say they were notified by a voyeur .
who called andrea ?
how would i know ?
go to your room .
you can pack tomorrow .
are they spying on us ?
it seems so .
don' t you care at all ?
no i don' t .
you are all asking me the same thing !
andrea ...
it' s nicholas .
i just watched your show .
i hope you weren' t bothered .
that wasn' t my intention .
did you want to get back at ramon ?
as a journalist you shouldn' t be discrete .
i don' t understand you .
check the rates tomorrow .
how did you know about the rape ?
from the voyeur .
where does he live ?
i can' t reveal my sources .
many people give me information .
you can' t imagine how many people are interested in other peoples ' affairs .
how did you learn immediately about the rape without knowing him ?
he called the police , and they called me .
don' t tell anyone though .
i live upstairs too .
i am in danger from him too .
i demand to know who it is .
don' t insist .
i don' t know him !
i am warning you , you are not the only one with the ability of revenge .
are you threatening me ?
take it anyway you want .
and you can forget our cooperation i don' t want anything to do with you .
have it your way .
i am warning you .
if you show any picture of us ... you will regret it .
are you working for her ?
i am a writer .
it' s how i make a living .
it' s you she wants to avenge .
from the moment i left her she threatens me constantly .
she should already be in jail .
call the police .
we have to find everything he recorded .
but will the police help ?
threaten them !
there is no reason for that ...
the police don t know him .
and how do you know that ?
because i am the voyeur .
i like to watch kika from my new studio .
was you that told andrea ?
i didn' t say that .
what are you saying then ?
i was watching kika and when she was in danger i called .
the video is elsewhere .
maybe in andrea s or her' s
show me everything you recorded .
what have you got here ?
souvenirs from mum .
is it her diary ?
so it' s you that had it .
i didn' t want it to fall in wrong hands .
have you read it ?
i can' t stand to read it .
can i take a look ?
don' t even think about it .
this is all .
i should have known .
you were watching us when i was making love to your mother .
look at that !
mr. prowler
where you spying on me yesterday ?
i was here .
but now , we know everything .
better off .
i am sick of hiding .
why did you move ?
it was supposed to take place in three days .
you are in no position to interrogate me !
very well .
go !
i don' t want to see you again !
tomorrow i am coming to collect my things .
remember ... you owe me half the house .
i' il give you an address to find me at the villa .
are you leaving ?
what have you got there ?
you didn' t pay me so i stole .
you did well .
let' s go get a cab .
i don' t feel like going up .
where are you going ?
to my cousin .
and you ?
don' t talk to me formally i don' t know , maybe to a motel .
where does she live ?
i' il take you .
i' il go alone ...
i could go anywhere with you .
don' t make such propositions .
i am sorry .
i wish everyone could be so honest .
give me a kiss .
i lied to you too .
you too ?
pablo is my brother .
pablo who ?
paul batho is my brother .
i am going to him now .
he went wherever he could .
what could i do ?
i had to help the poor boy .
wait up !
no please .
goodbuy .
to kill is like cutting your toenails .
in the beginning you are bored just of the idea but finally ... it' s done quicker than you expected .
you believe it' il take you a long time to get over it . but you get over it a lot faster than you thought .
what the hell are they saying ?
the pot ...
where is the pot ?
it' s there ...
it that you nicholas ?
and these stains ?
what stains ?
it' s like blood you are not well .
why did you come ?
you look awful .
i didn' t sleep much .
i feel awful too .
go home and we' il speak tomorrow .
we will never talk again .
i brought mama' s things .
and the diary you wanted .
why this change ?
except this note you own all the rest .
yesterday you had a different opinion .
i hadn' t read it .
did you manage to read it ?
kika left .
i was desperate .
and i thought of mum .
i thing that for the first time i really understood her . after i read it all .
you know how much i love mum .
i believed that someday she would respond to my love .
i was wrong though .
she did nothing .
she doesn' t even mention my name .
the only one that existed for her was you her executioner !
she wasn' t interested at all in me all she cared about was you ...
your mother couldn' t accept the fact that we were through .
and i' m no executioner .
you killed her !
you' re dreaming .
you killed her , but it doesn' t matter !
her life belonged to you !
you could do whatever you wanted with it !
your mother killed herself .
she had tried that again .
you know that .
you killed her .
i have the proof right here .
20th of april .
mum died in june .
this letter was written months before she died .
i would be in time for her to be alive to take her to the hospital .
but you found the letter , and kept it .
you gave it to me afterwards , to make it look as a suicide .
my dear kika ...
something really serious happened
i tried to find you
i have to talk to nicholas before he leaves i won' t see him again
i am not asking for another chance .
i know i don' t deserve it .
i wanted to die today , but don' t you mind about me
you gave me a lot more than what i was worth
wickedly , silently , i loved you and i still do .
forgive me , ramon
what do you want ?
i brought you the money .
how did you know i was here ?
i guessed .
may i come in ?
stop filming .
i brought you cash , so you don' t have to go to a bank .
very well ...
goodbye .
you have to sign the receipt .
i want to talk to ramon .
he isn' t here .
and his car outside ?
i brought it .
i know he is here .
i heard you talking .
i want you too , though .
i want an interview .
i want to interview you .
i know you haven' t got time .
i' il make it short .
i' il show it when you leave .
don' t toy with me .
i know everything .
all the trips were an excuse for you to kill .
you killed ramon' s mother , but i don' t care about the others .
like the blonde the day before yesterday .
i will cut your tongue !
you would if you could .
someone who kills a woman that sings to him ... is capable of a lot worse .
i am talking about the blonde .
you say she only stayed for an hour whereas she spent the night there . shortly before i called you .
isn' t that the truth ?
i am coming in , nicholas !
do you need more proof of what i can do to get an interview ?
it' s the first time i am talking to a killer and you think i am going to lose him like this ?
give me the knife !
sit down .
let' s talk like civilized people .
from the facts i have collected all this time ...
i bet you' ve committed a lot of murders .
i can analyze it for you but you are not going to stand in my way .
we don' t have time .
i need a doctor .
you need a lot more .
i' il make you a deal .
i' il find you a doctor and help you escape .
and in exchange you will do this interview .
i' il show it only after you' ve gone away from madrid .
you would like me to have the cash with me i' il send it to you though .
what' s your answer ?
do i have another choice ?
let' s begin .
you got rid of the blonde during the moving .
what' s her part in the novel ?
i am losing blood .
so let us not waste anytime !
why did you kill her ?
is she the last victim ?
why don' t you tell me once and for all that you are the lesbian killer ?
i' il explain everything .
when ?
help me to stop the bleeding first .
take the shirt and tie your knee .
don' t forget i am aiming at you though .
watch it .
why did you do that ?
we have little time .
nod to me , yes or no ?
after that i promise i' il take you to a hospital .
the crimes you write about it s you who did them , isn' t it ?
tell me ...
tell me ...
tell me it was you !
say " yes " !
what can i do now ?
what happened ?
this crazy woman ...
ramon ?
upstairs , in the room .
is he dead ?
nobody knows .
with this boy , you never know .
listen to me kika .
i don' t have much time .
take this .
i am giving it to you .
if you publish it , it will be a big hit .
just change the title and the leading role s name .
in it s place put my name . and you' il have my autobiography .
you are delirious .
hold me .
i want to die in the arms of a woman .
god !
we had met here .
why didn t i bring my makeup tools with me ?
it' s me kika !
it' s kika !
what happened ?
i don' t know .
i think you were apparently dead again .
my leg hurts .
i electroshocked you .
are you hurt ?
it' s not my blood .
something terrible happened .
are you strong enough to listen to me ?
don' t have another crisis .
are you going to leave me like this ?
we will talk about that later ...
i found nicholas and andrea dead in the living room .
i' ve never seen so much blood !
they must have killed each other .
when is this evil going to end ?
i am not superstitious , but since i took the ring , something always happens .
who' s was it ?
my mothers ' .
she wasn' t lucky either .
who had given it to her ?
my father .
i don' t know anything about you .
i never asked .
he died in a car accident .
christ !
i am going to call an ambulance and the police .
i will follow you in my car .
my car broke down and my sister is getting married .
i am sorry but i am going to a different direction ?
just somewhere i can find a cab ?
let' s go , hurry up ...
make yourself comfortable anyway you can .
we are leaving now .
do you want a towel for your hands ?
i would take you to the village , but i' m really busy .
