there was no reason to .
his mother was a stewardess , swedish .
crazy bitch .

lf he' s in jail , we can' t ...
of course you can .
visiting hours are over .
you' re smoking ?

it' s not anormal prison .
it' s for prisoners with life sentences .
they can' t just give us a cookie .
i' m about to die of hunger .
it' s impregnable . we' ve got to tell harald that we can' t get him out .
stop kicking , you loser .
brat .
i' m sorry , butyou can' t be here .
ls that lobster ?
wouldyou go back to your seat ?
how hadyou imagined we were going to get him out ?
drive abulldozer through the wall .
but there are three walls .
real silverware and cloth napkins .
what the hell are you doing ?
don' t eat my crab .
go back to your seat .
what did he do ?
he' s in sweden' s most heavily guarded prison .
it must have been parking tickets .
wouldyou go back to your seat ?
i' m sorry , butyou can' t be here .
stop it and go back to your seat .
lf you think about it ...
it might be that it' s not completely impossible .
lf you kick me one more time ...
here comes another cake .
hi .
can i help you ?
peter called and had some rooms set aside .
do you speak english ?
martin , doesn' t she speak danish ?
we have made areservation for two rooms for mr. blixen .
ask if they have a conference room .
a conference room ?
yes .
one with ablackboard .
why ?
ask . lf he' s had an idea , he' il tell us .
don' t we have to land first ?
then i' il ask .
just sign here for the rooms .
bitch .
come on .
come on , martin .
the keys ...
come on .
" meet room " ...
that' s what it' s called .
it' s not called a " meet room " .
that' s damn bad service .
peter is right .
she was abitch .
he just had amullet .
we' il meet in the conference room in two minutes !
tight security at the prison means the prisoners walk freely in the yard .
we' re going to use that .
let' s say you' re the pear .
you come in here ...
let' s back up alittle bit .
harald , this is you .
you walk into the yard and meet ludvig .
meanwhile martin and i are on the bridge , which is300 meters away .
lf we pretend this is the bridge , then that' s martin and this is me .
we' re standing looking into the prison yard .
we shoot awire300 meters down .
you click onto the wire .
you put on arappelling seat .
firstyou connect to the wire , and then to this basketball post .
then martin drives the truck down to the end of the bridge .
the truck is carrying a 1, 000 liter water deadweight .
so the wire is completely taut .
at the center of the wire is 7 1/ 2 meters of bungy cord .
release the wire , andyou' il fly over the wall and land under the bridge .
and martin and i will pick you up .
you don' t really mean this , do you ?
it' s completely safe .
people pay 500 kroner to do it by the harbor .
get whatyou need and put the bottles back in the mini bar .
here .
martin , put it on .
can you see him ?
there are alot of dogs .
they' re crazy about dogs over here .
hold this a second .
it' s the bungy .
ls he there ?
no .
there he is .
the guy by the bench ?
thank you very much .
hi .
i' ve come to getyou out .
leave me alone .
i think he' s got him .
then you get this .
your father would like to see you .
i don' t have a father .

guard !
what' s happening , martin ?
what' s happening ?
it' s those dogs .

pull !
how was i to know the dogs would hold on ?
let' s get him up .
do we have to ?
it' s not my fault the dogs held on so tightly .
we go left next time .
are you sure ?
it' s anon stop train .
it arrives in 11 minutes .
how much does a doberman actually weigh ?
ludvig !
hurry up .
come down here !
ln case someone sees you .
get lost !
what did he say ?
he doesn' t want to come down .
you' ve got to come home to denmark .
we' re taking the bridge .
you haven' t driven on ityet , have you ?
come down .
show it to him .
it' s apicture of your father , the monk .
you' re father' s really sick .
come on .
let me handle this .
that will give you abladder infection .

they' ve lied to you all these years .
come on .
we' ve brought a change of clothes for you .
ls it true ?
ls it my father ?
yes , it' s your father .

shit , man .
ludvig , stop it !
that' s not necessary .
i won' t run away .

harald , there' s somethingwrong with him .
can' tyou tell ?
look at his eyes , he' s crazy .
he' s a great guy .
35sveteas for apiece of pastry .
where are we now ?
a few hours ago , ludvig petterson , serving alife sentence , escaped .
he has been convicted of the murders of five women .
he is extremely dangerous .
lf you see this man  inform the police immediately .
what did they say ?
he killed five women .
damn , harald .
they were probably really irritating .
sister , how long can it take ?
harald ...
i don' t want to talk about it .
let us eat in peace .
ludvig ?
what are you doing ?
she was talking on the phone and there was this gust of wind .
and then she fell .
get into the car !
sorry .
you' ve got so much hair and i' ve got so little .
it feels so strange .
i' ve so wished ...
well , that i had a father .
we kids always thought
that we had a father who was apilot or amillionaire .
i was apilot once .
and millions rolled in once .
so theoretically , i could have been a great father .
damn !
i didn' t know that .
lf i had known that , you wouldn' t have gotten ...
i wasn' t what i should have been , but then i took care of harald .
can we go now ?
let them get to know each other .

1 million .
that' s alot of money .

there will be an accident .
the ambulance enters the apron .

some rent a guards .
what the hell are you doing , vuk ?
he' s stillwired !
it' s just a shoe !

the hercules flies so low that they won' t find us on radar .
you throw the money in the sea and jump after it .
vuk' s uncles on a ship pick us up .
the hercules crashes .
have you ever had your noses licked ?
the containers will sink . we can' t jump out of aplane , can we peter ?
yeah , well ...
can' t we jump out of aplane ?
there' s plenty of air in the containers .

i don' t know if it' s necessary .
you shouldn' t see apsychologist .
