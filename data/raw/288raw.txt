who is she ?
a " nightmare

henri

what do you mean by that ?
9 seconds slower than the job recorded .
that is the same as 9 light years .
you must try hard to win
currently it' s hard to win
idiot !
maybe it' s because of the car
listen !
we have a contract ...

you could wait for me at office
i am too curious .
i had to see the studio .
david has spoken about it a lot ...
come on

i' d like to have my husband' s place .
i wanna drive for le mans !

julie wood
not bad at all !
she said she want to replace david in le mans !
have you said yes to her ?
i said no
i' ve already tested 2 persons who can replace david
why shall we let her in ?
just want her to test
to see her ability is limited

julie , this is laura , the daughter of jean pierre .
you are great , laura .
henri vaillant , the grandfather of the child who commands me
before learning to drive i want you to learn to obey !
i can drive already
well !
then then only thing you need to learn is to obey !
the insurance company understands but don' t know what causes the explosion
we have carry the wreck here to let jos have a look
jos , what do you think ?
proteus crystals .
which let the vehicle lose control
basically there is no danger if it' s in the gasonline tank
only when the vehicle runs in the match , the crystal reach the electric circuits
then .... bang
so how does this crystal get in his gasoline tank ?
i don' t know
who put it ?
this id gabrielle steve , this is you
this is giulio
he brakes at the 85 meters in the front
that imprint is the mark
if it' s downwind , 85 meters is too short
so he go straight ahead
and where are you ?
here
you see the forest ?
this time of the year there are many falling leaves and keep the air cool .
the temperature is thus lower here , the air is more density
so it' s easy to brake
zig and zag ?
so it does
then what about other circuits ?
it' s from ancestors ' ... wisdom
how is the currently tyre imprint ?
good
le mans will start tomorrow what do we need now ?
hamburgers !
my treat
what do you say ?
great !
let' s go !
go !
taste like my hometown ...
turn right at the 6th crossing straight 200 sign , then turn left
you' ve been in the curcuit for over one hundred times you should know it well
entrance of the stadium .
sturdy right , in 2 .
brake softly , turn left
rush
yes ! understand !
i know it by heart !
that means with the eyes closed .
it' s impossible .
why must you say that ?
where is he going ?
just follow him
where to go ?
cover my eyes with your hands
are you sure ?
just told me at the 100 signs
ready ?
go
sign !
michel !

you may count on me .
michel
i want to say thank you for david and for me as well
see you later
the green flag waved ...
the cars startup then ... for a complete round in the order ...
that they acquired during the qualified positions .... and then the 70th 24 hourse of le mans begins !
we are going to watch a fierce battle !
vaillants doesn' t attack
seems there is a problem
that' s ...
vaillants is overdriving ?
no , not yet !
keep eyes on the situations !
what' s going on ?
we really try our best from the first rounds ?
i wish i knew
michel , is there any problem ?
everything is cool .
so what' s up with the hero ?
take a photo of " the leader " also !
okay . stand aside !
it' s strange !
the 2 cars put on their seeds at the same moment
it' s rare
it' s rare that 2 cars put on their seeds at the same moment
what' s happened ?
i hit bricks on the track
vaillants and cramer ...
cooperate with each other
change tyre !
change tyre !
vaillants is still in the seed
change !
come on !
when would you change the tyre ?
move the tyre in it !
cramer leaves the seed ...
oddly enough michel vaillant makes no use of this advantage .
we let him win seconds and he forfeits it
wait for me outside !
well then , henri ?
how do you like the show ?
i know you love your son
why do you do that ?
for my father
i watch him suffer the whole life because of you
as a child , i suffered from seeing my father like that
now michel and you will precisely feel what we have felt for years
for your childhood , i' m sorry
but the truth is that your father is a cheater .
he always a cheater .
and i think you are more despicable than he is
don' t be your father , just be be yourself !
let me go home , i' il forget those unhappy things
impossible !
steve , waht' s up ?
why do you stay behind " the leader " ?
are you afraid of speeding ?
of course not .
everything is okay .
