mom , why do you refer to weekly world news ... ... as " the paper " ?
the paper contains facts .
this paper contains facts .
and this paper has the eighth highest circulation in the whole wide world .
plenty of facts . " pregnant man gives birth .

she marries men under fake identities and then she murders them .
she' s murdered three men already .
victim number one was a lounge singer .

are you working on the forms for the vendor ?
yes , captain .
tony ?
tony ?
i don' t want to intrude , but you seem a little down .
well , captain , it' s about my job .
i' m having doubts about being a cop .
it' s not like how it is on tv .
i fill out forms and paperwork all day .
point well taken , but even though it' s not exciting ... ... it' s very important .
yeah , but of all my times as a cop , i' ve never ....
i never chased a guy across a crowded square .
i' ve never hung onto that part of the helicopter .
you know that part ?
you know ?
i know it .
i' ve never hung onto that or even commandeered a vehicle .
that sounds like a lot of fun .
that' s the other thing .
you' re too nice .
i' m too nice ?
yes , you' re too nice .
why not be like a starsky and hutch captain ?
where you haul me in your office and bawl me out ... ... because you' re tired of defending me from the commissioner .
the truth is , i report to a committee .
some are appointed , elected , or co opted biannually .
it' s a quorum , so to speak .
a quorum ?
i thought i was gonna be serpico ... ... but instead i' m like fish from barney miller .
hey , somebody needs a hug .
captain .
okay , coming up .
hi .
haggis , right ?
yeah , i' m the guy who ordered the haggis .
can i ask you a question ?
sure .
do you like haggis ?
no , it' s repellent .
i think scottish cuisine is based on a dare .
i' m next .
you' re next .
yes , can i help you ?
i' il tell you how you can help me .
all i want is one new york steak ... ... a quarter inch thick .
that' s all .
no more , no less .
get it and let me out .
i' m really busy .
be right back .
it' s busy , hey ?
it' s insane today .
my dad' s a butcher , and i used to work at his shop .
i can help you .
i' d love some help .

thanks for helping me out at the butcher shop .
you were really nice .
oh , i was nice ? " nice . " evidently you think of me as a woman friend .
and what is wrong with being nice ?
nothing .
charlie ?
yes ?
name a bad thing you' ve done .
i' ve done bad things .
tell me one bad thing you' ve done , and it better be evil .
how evil ?
really evil .
so evil that you would say it was " e vil .
like it' s " the fruits of the de vil . " " e vil .
for example , how many people have you brutally murdered ?
brutal " is a very subjective word .
what' s brutal to one person might be reasonable to somebody else .
excuse me .
do you know russian ?
yeah .
oh , this hurts .
no , this is hard .
not only are you extremely good looking ... ... but you' re also very smart and that' s no fair .
that' s hard .
bright women intimidate you ?
no , no .
not at all .
but it' s a shame i' m going to have to destroy you .
charlie , come here !
nadia ... ... l am coming .
expand , contract , expand .
what do you look for in a woman you date ?
i know everyone always says sense of humour ... ... but i have to go with breast size .

here we are .
wow !
what a great place .

what' s this ?
oh !
i had a friend who was a martial arts expert and ....
oh , you had a friend ?
it' s a martial arts thing .
i thought it would look good on the wall .
it does .
you know , scotland has its own martial arts .
it' s called " fuck you !
it' s mostly head butting and kicking people on the ground .
it' s late .
not for me .
who for , then ?
who for , then , what ?
if not for you , i wonder who it is late for .
not me , no .
i like the nightlife .
i like to boogie .
i' il make the tea , then .
you know ...
... maybe it is late .
i' il be honest with you .
i had a great time tonight ... ... and i' d really love to kiss you .
but if i kiss you , we' il end up on the couch , and if we end up there ... ... chances are we' il kiss in the bedroom ... ... and that' s the part i always rush into .
it' s not a good idea to rush into spending the night together .
i want to .
i have no problem with that .
you' re it .

i' d love to , but i' m running late .
how do silver dollar pancakes ... ... fresh orange juice , bacon and kona coffee sound ?
it sounds great .
sorry .
i didn' t have those other things .

that other stuff will kill you .
whereas froot loops are light and reasonably high in fibre .
i care for apple jacks a great deal .

so , is this your place ?
no , this is our place .
harriet' s and mine .
she sort of comes and goes but always ends up here .
she didn' t speak of me ?
no , she didn' t " speak of you .
she mentioned a martial arts guy , and there was discussion about ralph ?
oh , really ?

she talked about the martial arts guy and kind of shouted ralph .
well , you know harriet .
actually , i don' t .
but you did have sex with her .
hello !

just be careful .
just be careful .
i had the greatest night of my life last night .
sounds like you really like her .
i' m smitten .
i' m in deep smit .
she is wonderful .
but we shouldn' t talk about it .
i' il start analysing it , and that' s no good .
that is good .
you should just let it happen .
relax .
i am a park ranger , and i will lead you on the tour .
all the rangers at alcatraz were once guards , myself included .
my name is john johnson , but everyone calls me vickie .
please follow me .
i love vickie .
he' s great .
he' s the best .
this is the main cellblock area .
home to such famous criminals as ai capone ... ... mickey cohen , joseph " dutch " cretzer ... ... and robert stroud , the famous birdman of alcatraz .
this time will be different .
if something happens , i' il let it go .
it' s not my business .
for example , " ralph .
she says " ralph " in her sleep .
so what ?
ralph ?
this cell' s for solitary confinement ... ... that' s come to be known as " times square .
make sure everyone gets a look .
so who' s ralph ?
i don' t know .
more importantly , i don' t want to know .
that' s good .
did you and harriet , you know , last night ?
okay , dirtbag .
all you have to know is that harriet' s a sweet and loving person .
well , that' s good .
that' s nice .
and yes , we did .
all right !
close it up , close it up , close it up .
this is something the other tour guides won' t tell you .
in this cellblock , machine gun kelly ... ... had what we call in the prison system , a " bitch .
one night , in a jealous rage , kelly took a makeshift knife , or " shiv " ... ... and cut out the bitch' s eyes .
another thing about harriet i love  no , no .
and as if this wasn' t enough retribution for kelly ... ... the next day he and four other inmates took turns pissing ... ... into the bitch' s ocular cavities .
this way to the cafeteria .
tony , i' m really happy .
please , don' t let me screw this one up .
i' il try .
alrighty .
that ocular cavity thing was  when he mentioned pissing into ....

hello !
hello !

your family' s really great , charlie .
when your mother took out  was that before atlantic city ?
it' s a period in my life that i really don' t like talking about .

i hated atlantic city , charlie .
it' s a town full of gamblers and lounge singers .
ralph ?
no .

she murders her husbands , then changes her identity and marries again .
i never heard of it .

she told me she dated a martial arts expert .
it says that one of the victims was a martial arts expert .
last night , she put a move on my dad and tried to break his neck .
about 1 000 people have tried to break his neck .
if they also say " ralph " in their sleep , it' s a good start .
look here , " ralph elliot .
plumber from dallas .
missing since his honeymoon .
charlie , you' re just getting scared .

for me , just read it ?
" larry leonard , the croner ...
crooner . " ... made a name for himself ... ... being able to sing , in six languages , ' only you . " '
does harriet know the words to " only you " ?
we haven' t reached that critical ... ... " do you know the words to ' only you " ' phase .
