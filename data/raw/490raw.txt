if you have any questions you' il find all the answers in there .
and , if i were you , i' d get rid of the mildew on the chin .
my soul patch ?
uh , yeah .
you like working for this devlin guy ?
i don' t work for him .
i' m not a professional driver , but i' d always believed that thing you' re staring into is designed for the monitoring of traffic , not passengers .
am i wrong ?
while i' m really enjoying our time together shall we try moving ?
wallace has been my partner for years .
something' s happened to him .
he wouldn' tjust disappear .
now , you get yourjob done and find my partner .
so tell me how .
you' re the head of an intelligence agency .
why don' t you be intelligent ?
i don' t understand what you' re talking about .
well , why don' t you call me back when you do understand what i' m talking about .
did we just take the balsam road exit ?
of course .
you have to take the surface street .
sorry .
did you get a copy of the rules ?
did you read them ?
jimmy , let me tell you something , my friend ...
i hate the rules .

yes , sir .
c. s. a. headquarters
deputy director chalmers , ladies , gentlemen
i present to you special agent wallace .
deceased two days , 14 hours , five minutes ... approximately .
pretty interesting .
now , why don' t you , uh , tell me a little about him ?
well , in simplest terms , he drowned in his bathtub .
contusion here suggests he hit his head fell prone , unconscious .
the man infiltrated a serbian death squad with not even a scratch .
he goes down in a bathtub ?
life' s a bitch .
you want to put him back in the fridge ?
wo he didn' t drown , sir .
he was murdered .
does that make life a little less bitchy ?
and and you would be ?
that' s del blaine , sir .
she' s having a filter installed between her brain and mouth next week .
so you don' t think he drowned ?
well , sir , there was water in his lungs but the pulmonary vein was filled with collapsed platelets indicative of dehydration .
he died of thirst .
thirst .
and it wasn' t just city tap water .
the mineral profile fit a high end bottled water but what was really weird is that it contained a strain of bacteria that i , so far haven' t been able to culture .
anyway , uh ... didn' t mean to interrupt .
ooh , the woman seems to know a lot about water .
yeah .
she thinks she knows a lot about a lot of things .
you know , we have a special situation in the field .
i think we could use your talents .
you interested ?
when do i start ?
you ever hear of clark devlin ?
rumors and innuendo .
del , i could tell you a thing or two about clark devlin .
uh , you think we could keep our minds out of the gutter for about a second ?
meet me upstairs in an hour .
you mightjust become
clark devlin' s next partner .
i' m going to need that gerris marginalis as soon as possible .
wo yes .
my contacts in guatemala have what you' re looking for , i' m sure .

and , meanwhile ...
i' il take one of these beautiful uticella marginalis .
just gorgeous .
now , you' re going to call me ?
is your phone number on file ?
i' m having a bit of trouble with the phones at the moment .
it might be better if you dropped it off yourself .
it may take a while .
well , why don' t you familiarize yourself with the route ?
there' s a little gathering at my house tonight a fund raiser for the natural history museum .
i would so love to have you .
should i send a car ?
i drive myself .
admirable .
eight o' clock .
and , uh , be sure not to wear anything too distracting , or no one will get their checkbooks out .
how did you learn to be so smooth ?
i' ve seen the way you drive .
you have the same instincts i do .
you lack confidence .
the girl in the art gallery' s not beyond you , you know .
you know about her ?
every time we leave the house we go by the art gallery and slow down .
you just need a little polish .
i' il never be a clark devlin .
don' t tell anyone this , jimmy , but there' s a lot less to clark devlin than meets the eye .
i' ve got a couple of good lines and a couple of very expensive suits .
apart from that , we' re exactly the same .
how about a couple hundred million ?
trust me ... 90/ o of it is clothes .
the other ten percent ?
the other ten percent' s in there .
you' ve got plenty of it .
oh , mr. devlin , can i ask you a big favor ?
yeah ?
can i stop wearing my hat ?

i' il tell you , i' m pretty excited .
i mean , nervous , but i' m excited .
i' m pumped , you know .
i knew i was doing good work for banning lnternational but i didn' t know mr. banning would be taking so much notice of me so soon .
i' il say this , though , when i' m ceo of this place
i won' t be having my headquarters in the bottom of a boat , you know what i mean ?
why did you choose mr. lundeen ?
he questioned my growth projections .
no , that' s not it .
i don' t like his hair .
mr. banning .
so , word filtered down to me that you don' t share my optimism about our company' s future .
oh , no .
actually , i just ...
drink ?
oh , yes , thank you .
i just felt that to meet your projections , pretty much every person on earth would have to drink only banning springs water .
yes , indeed .
water , mr. lundeen , comprises 60/ o of your body .
don' t you find it incredible that two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom can combine to create something so beautiful so useful , so essential ?
i find water to be miraculous .
do you think i' m silly ?
not at all .
feeling thirsty ?
yes .
you' re helping me out by being a guinea pig for a new product .
oh , i see .
what a brilliant idea .
water that makes you thirsty .
what' s in it ?
salt ?
there' s no profundity in salt .
bacteria .
once ingested its dna will instruct your cells ' cytoplasm to spill electrolytes into your bloodstream causing dehydration .
it' s virulent but , unfortunately , it' s too fast .
way too fast .
as we speak , your internal organs are shriveling .
you' re becoming as dry as ...
well , as dry as your limited imagination .
gentlemen , fetch the vacuum , won' t you ?
thank you .
schiffer , schwartzkopf , sondheim , springsteen ...

you' re the senior officer .
i' il play it however you want .
deitrich banning is holding a meeting with water ceos .
the agency wants us to find out what he' s planning .
wh what about walter strider ?

i don' t know .

okay .
so , we will meet tomorrow .
v 1 5 , 1 0 : 00 .
i' il be wearing a gray suit .

uh , yeah .
nice rack .
hello .
mr. devlin , there' s been a change of plans .

clark devlin ?
i' m del blaine .
have we met before ?
no .
good .
okay , del blaine , let' s do what we' ve come here to do .
i' il follow you .
ladies first .
okay .
a couple of details changed from what was in the file .
you read it ?
the files are crap .
give me the short version .
deitrich banning' s holding a meeting of international water company ceos .
we think he' s trying to force them into selling their companies to him .
where are you going ?
huh ?
i' m thinking .
we had agent wallace working undercover at his bottled water factory .
that is , until last week .
wallace calls us on his cell phone to tell us that the operation had reached critical mass and , suddenly , wham !
dead .
as you requested , a klineholtz bolt action nine millimeter titanium folding stock with 20 time infrared sniper scope and counterweighted micro rifled barrel .
my favorite gun .
but i don' t kill people anymore .
killing ?
you' re planting a bug .
it was all in that " crap " file .
go look through your binoculars .
they' re arriving .
ready ?
it' s critical we get a listening device in banning' s meeting .
range 962 feet .
aim for the briefcase .
should be a piece of cake for you , sir .
you kind of missed .
in the year 2001 $35 billion worth of bottled water was consumed worldwide .
today , bottled water costs more per gallon than gasoline .
we , my friends , are the new oil barons .
we at banning springs have developed a new filtration process that would protect your assets against the biological holocaust that' s coming .
looks like we got company .
csa would be my bet .
you' ve heard what i have to say .
now i' d like to hear you .
how much is this plan going to cost us ?
it won' t cost you a penny , out of pocket .
all i ask is to become your slightly more than equal partner .
banning says he' s got the only process to make their water safe .
but to use it , they' ve got to give him half of their companies ?
he' s trying to muscle these guys into selling their companies to him .
banning says that their water sources are in danger .
something about everyone being defenseless against more deadly forms of bacteria .
i can barely make out what he' s saying .
do you want to listen to this ?
what do you think that means , sir ?
del blaine !
yeah , i' il be there in a minute .
yeah , i' d really like some help up here , sir .
del blaine !
do you hear me , sir ?
i know this is not near as exciting as most of your missions , but could you humor me with just a little professionalism ?
i would really love some help ...
what are you doing ?
what' s with the jumpy jumpy ?
take off your headphones !
what ?
your headphones !
okay , chapter six of the training manual .
unarmed assailant frontal attack .
begin !
stomach , head !

del ...
nice of you , moron .
not in the manual .
creep !
del blaine !
stop !
get off of me !
why didn' t you stop ?
god , what the hell is wrong with you ? !
how do you ... fall off a building and end up ... uh ...
would you stop that ?
it' s okay .
i am in the car with a psychopath .
we are not safe .
are you upset ?
why would i be upset ?
i' ve always wanted to begin and end my career with a big fat failure !
thank you very much , mr. devlin .
it' s my first time .
i mean ... every mission is like my first time .
it' s so difficult being clark devlin .
oh .
sorry .
aah !
i didn' t do that .
what ... i is wrong with you ? !
i' m not who you think i am .
stay away !
i' m a little over amped myself right now .
let' s just call it a day .
get some rest and medication .
what ?
we' il be in communication .
oh .
i don' t have your phone number !
c. s. a. target range
who am i kidding ?
i have no idea what i' m doing or why i' m doing it .
i felt the same way when i took my first field assignment .
then i met clark devlin and life just got a whole lot better ... and a little more complicated .
let' s , uh , can we get a close can we ... ?
how do we pan down ...
yeah .
just hit the second button there .
everybody warned me , he was unorthodox but he' s way irrational , bordering on nutso .
we' il just get , uh ...
that' s it .
there , yeah .
that' s it , there .
look at that .
move it over , over just a bit .
he' s getting under your skin , isn' t he ?
he got under my skin once and i' m still feeling it .
yeah , you told me .
what about his english ?
oh , i can never understand half of what he says but don' t you just love his accent ?
she can' t hear anything from here ... ?
no , i don' t think ...
whoa !
god , i wish i was still back in the field .
how do you like me now ?
she' s got issues , man .
holy ...
can your , uh , can your girlfriend shoot , uh ...
a groin out of a target ?
let' s go .
let' s get our nails done .

constipated .
creepy .
horny .

this is why you don' t have a boyfriend .
no wonder you didn' t get anything from banning .
oh ... right , i didn' t get anything from banning except where his friggin ' lab is .
where ?
let' s see if the great master " agent " can figure it out .
banning said he sometimes has trouble sleeping .
big secret .
all men have trouble sleeping .
sometimes at night , he goes down and works in his lab .
he sleeps in his lab ?
he sleeps in his bedroom .
his lab' s in his bedroom ?
no .
get your facts straight .
his lab is at his house his casa , where he lives get it ?
excellent .
you passed the test .
i put in a good word with the boss .
well , let' s go see chalmers tonight .
no .
keep him out of this .
just you and me .
you know , if you' re so good at this why why don' t you tell me something about me ?
okay .
you have big crush on me and i know your name is del blaine .
first of all , you wish , and ... my real name is delilah .

why don' t you offer him five bucks ?
i have them somewhere .
birds of a feather ...
nice party , huh ?
so , you' re the strong , silent type , huh ?
that' s the whole bouncer package .
i didn' t mean your package .
thank you ...
dr. schwartz .
shalom .
come , darling .
product launch , my ass .
let' s go find banning' s lab .
let' s go .
are you trying to get me alone ?
where' d they go ?
don' t tell me the great clark devlin can' t come up with an answer .
although he can walk on water .
it' s a trick , right ?
come on .
wow !
mr. devlin likes insects , too .
what ?
oh , uh , uh , i mean sometime i speak of myself in the third person .
hmm , del blaine thinks you' re a freak .
have you cleaned the tanks ?
what are they doing down there ?
i don' t know .
when you' re done here you can go and sweep the tunnels .
don' t use the blower !
i can tell the difference .
and don' t touch the tequila for me and mr. banning .
whatever you say there , dr. simms .
yes , dr. simms .
louder !
yes , dr. simms .
we better hope the little ones follow the queen .
well , if they don' t the stock is going to be worthless .
follow the queen " ?
huh ?
have you seen cheryl ?
maybe he' s gay .
cheryl ?
no .
man , let' s get out of here .
let' s go have a smoke .
it still stinks .
hey .
how did you ... ?
whatever .
look at this .
he' s pinpointed the national reservoirs .
he' s going to poison the water ?
not with that stuff .
it' s too detectable and there' s government safeguards .
let' s check out the computer .
now you' re thinking .
who are they ?
they shouldn' t be in the lab .
let' s go .
oh , my god .
oh , your god what ?
dna recombinant microbes carrying a t 4 genome .
english .
genetically induced hydrogen oxygen barrier .
normal person' s english .
dehydrating water .
drink it , you' il shrivel up and die but the big question is , how is he possibly going to introduce it into the water supply ?
i think we better go .
huh ?
go .
quick , over there by the wall .
nobody here .
let' s check the hatchery .
you' re on my foot .
what was that about ?
shh !
go !
how did they miss us ?
what , are they blind ?
don' t look up my skirt .
set adrift on memory bliss of you
the camera pans the cocktail glass
behind a blind of plastic plants
i found the lady with the fat diamond ring
then you know i can' t remember a damn thing
i think it' s one ...
banning' s got the bacteria but he has to transport it from his lab to the water .
there' s no way he can .
maybe with airplanes .
not possible .
besides , even if he could get it to a reservoir undetected an alarm would trigger the second the surface of the water' s broken .
you' re really smart .
it' s an act .
i' m an inexperienced girl who' s trying to bluff her way through .
you are ?
come on , stop humoring me .
just be honest . ... assuming that there are some out there ...
honest ?
all right .
you think i' m the great clark devlin .
... gonna say i look lovely ...
yeah , hello ?
steena , i can' t talk right now . ... i can' t lie
she' s just one of those corners in my mind
and i just put her right back ...
yeah .
yeah , i can handle it .
bad news ?
can we go somewhere and be ... alone ?
sure .
i didn' t know you were so strong .
take off your clothes .
let' s not do anything we' il regret .
take off your clothes .
what' s happening ?
look , i knew the second i met you you weren' t clark devlin .
now take off the tuxedo .
it doesn' t belong to you .
i wanted to tell you , but i just didn' t know how .
take off your clothes .
what is that ?
hey !
whoa !
you , out here !
okay .
take the clothes .
okay .
slow down .
my name is jimmy tong .
i' m mr. devlin' s driver .
he asked me to find walter strider .
i don' t want to hear any more of your lies .
now , give me the watch and the shoes .
now , where' s clark devlin and how did you think you were going to get away with this ?
things happened .
i decided to go with the flow .
what about the underwear ?
they' re mine .
i i mean , my roommate .
jimmy .
suits you .
these are my roommate' s , too .
go finish your business .
have you seen the emperor ?
no .
impolite to leave without saying good bye to the host .
i was just looking for deitrich .
i' il take you to him , then .
like a big terrier with a little rat .
i think she was down in the lab .
well , at least your interest in water was genuine .
look , i' m here because of you .
you wanted to know if i could be trusted ?
i bet this tux is just your size .
thank you .
we got a positive location on blaine , sir .
how long till we get to her ?
20 minutes .
i' ve transmitted the coordinates .
dear mr. devlin
i did the best i could , but it wasn' t good enough .
i did not find walter strider for you .
i also lost your tuxedo .
i' m sure you will get it back .
i guess i will go back to being what i was before i met you .
oh !
water strider .
water strider .
water strider !
stupid !
my beautiful little darlings .
gerris maginatus .
species native to southeast asia .
commonly known as the water strider .
walter strider .
yes , the water strider .
very good .
very good .
well , it' s brilliant .
they touch down on the reservoirs .
their little feet transfer a deadly bacteria without breaking the surface of the water so no alarms sound , and it looks like a nasty little trick of nature .
fortunately there is one drinkable water source .
yours .
deitrich , you' re a genius .
too bad it won' t work .
oh ... you so wrong .
wrong !
wrong !
wrong .
it will work because my plan is perfect .
sorry , mr. banning , it' s your plan ... and mine .
um ... it' s ours .
shut up .
explain .
oh , all righty .
the life cycle of the gerris maginatus begins with mating something dr. simms is not personally familiar with .
anyhoo , the insects swarm to freshwater where fertilized eggs are then deposited on the underside of lotus leaves and hatch into larvae .
spare me the discovery channel blather .
tell me why it won' t work .
yes , tell us .
why it won' t work ?
this is the northern hemisphere , correct ?
you incubated insects native to the southern hemisphere .
so , simply , it is too cold for them to mature sexually much like simms here .
therefore ... they won' t mate .
therefore , they won' t seek out water .
is this true ?
no , i knew a girl once , in college , quite well .
very well .
and then you remember cousin doris ?
no , simms , the bugs .
the bugs .
oh , you' re not going to believe this hootchie are you , mr. banning ?
oh , yeah ?
ask him if i lied about the tuxedo .
this tuxedo is ... it' s all right .
it' s ...
all right " ?
that is the most incredible piece of technology on the planet .
and i am laying it in your big , hot hands .
mr. banning , release the bugs .
go ahead .
do what he tells you .
you might have a chance at second prize at a junior high school science fair but you can forget your dreams of world domination .
slip into it , deitrich .
see how it feels .
the other ten percent' s in there .
you' ve got plenty of it .
hey , dr. schwartz .
tell your boss clark devlin is back .
drapes nicely .
well , it certainly puts a spring in one' s step .
happy to have lightened your loafers , deitrich .
one question .
why are you doing this ?
hey , what the hell is this ?
this is the moment where 50 csa commandos storm in take you , your pretentious accent your jackass sideburns to the federal pen where , guess what ?
all they serve is highly chlorinated tap water .
presenting clark devlin .
have i told you how amazing you look in this tuxedo ?
simms , prepare for release .
with pleasure , sir .
hatchery doors opening .
water sources targeted .
pods will begin releasing striders in five minutes .
85/ o .
why are you here ?
i' ve come to save you .
that' s great .
what about the big guys with the big guns ?
for years , i' ve heard about you .
now we finally meet , i find that the great clark devlin is nothing more than an ordinary man who' s about to die an extraordinary death .
you' re right except for one thing .
my name' s tong .
james tong .
you okay ?
uh , jimmy , is there something you want to tell me ?
later .
oh , you' ve got a good suit as well .
all right !
let go !

no !
she' s ruining everything .

uh huh , they did .
mr. banning , you must open the hatch manually .

manual hatch release required .

clark !
i mean , jimmy , help me !
i' m busy .

bacteria laced microbes fully activated .
his head' s about to explode .
look at him .
look at him !
you might know a few tricks but you' re just a sad , pathetic man .
smoking is bad for your health .
you okay ?
yeah , duh .
by the way , nice going .
now millions of people are going to die of dehydration .
you left the hatch open .
they' re not flying away .
yeah , what are they waiting for ?
they are waiting ... to follow the queen .
airborne striders awaiting queen release .
oh , my god .
for once , you' re right .
the queen is going to lead the striders to freshwater sites all over north america .
quick , grab it before it' s released .
queen strider disengaged .
alert !
queen strider disengaged .
let' s go .
he' s got the queen !

winton chalmers , csa .
i spearheaded the operation that took down deitrich banning .
i bet you' re jimmy tong .
here' s your tuxedo .
you happy now ?
well , i will be when i get it safely back to headquarters .
by the way , blaine , not a bad job for your first time in the field .
well , i didn' t do it alone .
she always says nice things about me .
when you finally do something right , you deserve the credit .
well , sir it' s an honor to help the united states of america .
i feel exactly the same way , soldier .
you don' t think you' re going to be able to get away with a bureaucratic pat on the butt , do you ?
well , i' m hoping to .
ooh , man down , people .
well ... there is one thing you can do for me .
and that would be ?
all right , tracking systems locked on .
anybody screws up and your ass is mine .
block off this end of the street .
