what ?
i keep thinking about hawaii , right now .
my heart' s in hawaii .
how the hell can your heart be in hawaii when you' ve never been there ?
you mean there' s no place you' d rather be than here ?
i' m just saying i don' t know how you can think about hawaii right now .
if i was in hawaii right now , i wouldn' t think about being here .
see the difference ?
no .
i' m not in hawaii .
i' m here , right ?
i don' t want to be here .
i want to be in hawaii .
but i can' t be in hawaii .
therefore , i think about it so as not to get depressed about being here .
but i' m here .
right .
i don' t want to be here .
right .
but i can' t be anyplace else , ' cause all i see is this shit .
now , how do you get around that ?
that' s what i' m asking you .
focus .
focus .
it' s time .
no more hawaii .
focus on this .
yeah ?
aloha .
aloha my ass , divinci .
left at the corner .
what' s up ?
hope you don' t mind me checking for weapons .
yeah .
i do mind .
yeah .
what the fuck do i want a man' s hands on my body for ?
hold it .
okay , check him .
check good .
there' s a lot of good hiding spots on this body .
watch out .
that' s the loot .
he' s got nothin ' .
so , what you got ?
not bad at all .
any more where this came from ?
maybe .
then maybe we talk again .
maybe .
yeah .
told you there was a lot of good hiding places on this body .
bet you got a lot of good hiding spots on that body , too .
come on , man , hurry up !
let' s go !
let' s go !
joe .
wake up .
get out of the street before you get run over .
other way , joe .
forget it .
i don' t think you' d feel it anyway .
what the fuck ?
keeping some late hours ?
come on , man !
what the fuck are my neighbors gonna think ?
i apologize .
i understand your concerns .
you must also understand that , unlike a bank ... ... i cannot rely on a late fee as sufficient encouragement to repay one' s debts .
therefore , i am forced to hire the likes of mr. cutlass supreme ... ... whom , i might add , contributes significantly to my overhead .
i' m the real loser here , and i' m concerned about your sincerity ... ... in repaying the $27, 942 gambling debt ... ... that is one week past due .
what can you do to reassure me of your good intentions ?
i can make your life fucking miserable , that' s what i can do .
look at me .
do i have a wife and three kids ?
do i have a good job at ibm ?
am i a handsome guy ?
no , no and no .
i loan money at excessively high interest rates ... ... to pricks like you who can' t control their urge ... ... to lose big money playing cards .
then i have to stay up all night ... ... trying to convince them that i have needs , too .
the point of which is , i already have a fucking miserable life ... ... so don' t threaten me , you lousy bag of cat shit .
you fuckin ' ...
all i' m asking is that you be responsible .
is that unreasonable ?
that' s $4, 000 .
that' s all i got .
i' m proportionally reassured .
you purchased yourself an extension .
another day , another body .
where do you want to start ?
a hit ?
yeah .
it looks like it .
could be gang related .
happened some time last night .
2 : 00 , 3 : 00 in the morning .
got an african american male .
looks like he' s in his 30s , but even that' s a guess .
half his head is on the upholstery .
got any witnesses ?
sure .
hundreds .
fucking animals !
shotgun shells , 12 gauge .
three shotgun shells , 12 gauge .
hey , divinci .
heard you got a gang related , you lucky guy .
yeah , one less drugstore on the street .
the world' s a safer place .
thanks .
no problem .
brown ?

no , no , no .
come on .

detectives divinci and rodriguez ... ... this is richard simms .
he' s with the dea .
he wants to ask you some questions about your case .
what' s the occasion ?
you get an id on the victim ?
still waiting on the prints .
car was registered to ...
anchor imports .
' 81 el dorado , black .
lf you got this , what do you want with us ?
the man in the car was lionel hudd .
how does he know that ?
what the hell' s going on here , captain ?
hudd was dea , undercover .
he was working a case on syndicate distribution of narcotics ... ... but every dealer we tagged kept getting killed .
we finally got a lead on a girl .
hudd was a friend of mine , and i' m gonna nail the son of a bitch who killed him .
look ... ... we' re gonna do everything we can to help you .
a cop' s a cop , right ?
that' s right .
shit !
fucking dumb fuck .
what a dumb fuck !
all right , just calm down .
why didn' t you fucking frisk him ?
calm down for a second .
you didn' t think to fuckin ' search him ?
just calm down !
you hear me ?
you killed a fucking cop !
calm the fuck down !
calm the fuck down !
goddamn son of a bitch !
get your fucking hands off me , fucker .
you just calm the fuck down !
you understand me ?
you fucking understand me ?
i want you to shut up and fucking listen to me for a second .
they could be watching us right now , you asshole .
let me go .
get in the fucking car .
now look , there' s no fucking reason to panic .
no fucking reason to panic ?
this ain' t no fucking reason to panic ?
stop being an idiot .
all right ?
we' re the cops on this case .
this is our case .
we' re gonna find the fucking killer .
we are the fucking killers !
since when does that matter ?
all they want is someone to go down for the crime .
right ?
do we care who goes down for the crime ?
fuck , no .
as long as someone goes down for the crime .
it' s a slot that' s gotta be filled .
slot to be filled .
frank , we killed a fucking cop .
that doesn' t bother you ?
of course it bothers me .
what the hell you want me to do ?
turn myself in ?
i' m not gonna do that .
look , this is a risk we take every goddamn day .
somebody might pop us , especially undercover like that .
so somebody got popped .
he got popped .
it happens .
it happens . " he' s a fucking cop !
you don' t get popped by cops when you' re a cop !
i patted him down .
he had no badge .
he had no gun .
what the fuck was i supposed to do ?
how was i supposed to fucking know ?
you patted him down ?
you couldn' t feel a fucking wire ?
no .
he had no badge , nothing .
i' m telling you , he was a fucking idiot .
but we got to start thinking about us here , man .
the important thing is not to lose control of this case .
yeah .
whatever evidence there is , it' s got to go through us .
we lay down a trail , we make it nice and logical .
we' re the teachers and two and two can add up to five if it' s our classroom .
so what are you saying ?
you' re saying we stick this to somebody ?
yeah .
evidence points to wherever the fuck we want it to point .
too fucking weird .
we can provide so much fucking evidence ... ... that even the asshole we pick will think he fucking killed him .
so you got an asshole in mind ?
don' t worry .
don' t worry .
we' il find a killer .
there' s lots of them out there .
come on .
what the fuck did i do now ?
what the fuck is all this for ?
do we look like fucking track stars to you ?
we' re here to fucking run ?

who did i kill ?
where were you last friday night ?
you mean , what' s my alibi , right ?
yeah , yeah , yeah .
i was breaking and entering .
jewelry store on seventh and front about 9 : 00 .
not even close to your jurisdiction .
and i got the rocks to prove it .
sorry i can' t help you guys ... ... but one to five is way better than 10 to life .
you know what i' m saying ?
look , this is our case , not the goddamn dea' s .
it' s been three days .
look , we' re not fucking magicians here .
it' s only three days .
this is a big goddamn murder case .
we need a little time .
when a federal undercover officer goes down ... ... it' s never a fucking murder case .
look , i don' t like the dea on my ass any more than you like them on yours ... ... but this is personal for them , and they want answers .
forget your other cases and get me something , anything i can give to them .
the last thing i want is the goddamn fbi on my back , too .
all right , we got a few leads .
we' il follow up .
i can' t hold them off much longer .
this is bullshit .
and you both know it .
no disrespect ... ... but this is no way to run a fucking investigation !
easy .
let me tell you both something .
if you don' t solve this quick , they' re gonna start asking why .
and they' il want to blame somebody in this department .
get something fuckin ' fast , or turn over what you' ve got and get out of the way .
that' s it , baby !
i think this is breaking and entering , isn' t it ?
i work homicide .
i don' t work that shit .
did you learn anything you didn' t already know ?
yeah .
you surprise me sometimes .
i think you' re just a hard case , and i discover you got a heart of gold .
organ donor ?
that' s really nice .
too bad they' il never use your best parts .
i' il make sure you get them .
thank you .
i appreciate that .
i just think it' s real nice , that' s all .
i' m surprised we got something in common besides ... ... what we got in common .
what' s so interesting out there ?
i' m just thinking , that' s all .
about us ?
no .
good .
what if i was thinking about us ?
don' t waste your time .
what if i was ?
where' s it gonna get us ?
maybe i got plans .
yeah , i don' t want to hear them .
plans just make you think that something' s gonna get better .
i' m fine .
i don' t need to get screwed up waiting for something good to happen .
i want you to know that love is important to me .
me , too .
but more important is ioyalty ... ... ' cause ioyalty is about respect .
and i' m ioyal to you ... ... like i am ioyal to my partner .
we are closer than blood , and i trust him with my life .
why are you telling me ?
' cause when you asked me if i was thinking about us and i said i wasn' t ... ... i want you to know ... ... i do .

yeah .
somebody popped him that night .
probably when he was unloading the stuff .
i don' t know .
look , does anybody think that ...

they can' t connect us .
besides , we got the guy who did it .
you scared the hell out of me .

you look at them , and then you look at the man ... ... and you say , " it' s him .
and i ask you if you' re sure .
and you say , " absolutely .
no question .
and this is all i have to do ?
he confessed .
you id him , he' s going straight to the can .

people who hang around your neighborhood aren' t capable of killing ?
you don' t live in a great neighborhood !
sign the goddamn paper .
what paper ?
when you pick a guy out of a lineup , you gotta sign a paper that says so ... ... or they' il think we made the shit up .
yeah ?
why would they think something like that ?
just sign it .
i thought you said all i had to do was pick him out .
this is just part of it .
you sign it , and you' re finished .
how come you' re so sure he did it ?
jesus fucking christ .
he confessed .
bullshit !
lady , we got the confession on paper .
he didn' t do it !

now just sign the goddamn thing !
fuck .
bring him down here .
warden .
damn , man , you smell him ?

he wouldn' t give us his last name .
he signed a confession , but he wouldn' t give you his last name ?
he couldn' t remember it .
what can i say ?
the guy' s a head case .
you run the prints ?
yeah .
no priors .
ballistics match ?
you know , you guys are funny .
a. 44 was used in commission .
we found a fucking . 44 on him .
it doesn' t take a rocket scientist here , guys .
he did it .
went down pretty quick .
it' s our street .
i think they did a hell of a job .
god damn it !
some goddamn piece of shit blows him away for nothing !
fuck .
i' m sorry .
hudd was too good for this to happen .
i just didn' t think he' d go down this way .
it was good work .
thanks .
sorry .
i appreciate it .
do me a favor .
make sure this one sticks .
i don' t want these dea assholes back in here .
word is he killed a dea undercover .
word is he signed a confession .
word is everyone' s entitled to a defense , no matter how guilty they ...
shit .
okay , judy .
he' s detoxing .
i gave him something to help him through it .
can i talk to him ?
joe , can you hear me ?
joe , i' m elliot goff .
hi .
i' m your attorney .
joe ...
you understand what i' m saying to you ?
joe ...
and it was just two hours later , on that same friday night ... ... when the defendant , clyde dunner ... ... entered the home of george and carol beeman ... ... a . 44 caliber pistol in his hand .
he entered that house with one thing in mind ... ... to kill george and carol .
why ?
because those were the two people ... ... he blamed for the breakup of his marriage to carol' s sister , paula .
george and carol were watching a movie .
they were sitting on their couch watching television ... ... when the defendant entered the living room ... ... and opened fire .
george was killed instantly , hit in the face , and carol died later ... ... three bullet wounds to her chest .
and then the defendant , in an effort to cover up his crime ... ... doused them both with lighter fluid ... ... and set the house on fire .
carol was still alive .
ladies and gentlemen of the jury ... ... we will prove to you beyond any reasonable doubt ... ... that the defendant , clyde david dunner , is guilty of two counts of murder ... ... in the first degree .
the defense may now proceed .
jesus christ !
i don' t know where .
what' s wrong ?
they can' t find the murder weapon .
what are you talking about ?
they can' t find the goddamn gun !
they lost it or something .
misplaced it .
what ?
i don' t have a goddamn case without the goddamn gun !
the fingerprints , the ballistics , everything .
i have to have the fucking gun .
that murdering piece of slime is gonna go free without the . 44 .
how the fuck can they lose it ?
yes .
eden , i want to speak to capt. henderson .
you used the dunner gun ?
i can' t believe it !
this is not my fuck up .
why didn' t you use the fucking gun from the kennedy murder ?
listen , our shooting was supposed to be gang related and unsolved .
only because we popped a goddamn undercover cop ... ... did we need to find a fucking . 44 for evidence .
otherwise , we would' ve never needed it , so don' t point your finger at me .
all right , okay ?
all fuckin ' right .
fine .
but you explain to me how we got the same gun ... ... for two murders by two different fucking killers ?
and it' s supposed to be in police custody .
all right .
don' t explain it .
it' s their fuck up .
they lost the goddamn evidence .
ballistics are already complete in the dunner' s case .
all we need is another gun .
all my merchandise is in top condition .
untraceable .
we' il take the . 44 .
hi , joe .
i' m elliot .
we met the other ...
you weren' t in good shape .
you look better now .
have a seat .
we have to talk .
about what i did ?
yeah .
sit down .
before we get started , i want to go over a couple of things with you first .
now , joe is your first name .
i assume that' s " joseph .
okay .
what about doe ?
is that what you told the officers your last name was ?
i don' t think so .
what did you tell them your last name was ?
i don' t remember .
is doe your last name ?
do you know what your last name is ?
i would tell you if i could remember .
joe smith ?
joe jones ?
joe dimaggio ?
all right .
okay .
do you have any family ?
do you have any friends ?
i don' t know .
joe , you ...
you don' t know very much about yourself , do you ?
but you remember the night you shot the man in the car ?
why ?
because i can .
i' m sorry , i' m not ... ... much help .
when you approached the suspect in his apartment ... ... did you identify yourself as a police officer ?
yes .
and did the suspect respond ?
yes , he did .
in what way ?
he shot through the door .
he fired six times until his gun was empty .
ladies and gentlemen ... ... i would like to show you the weapon that he used .
a smith & wesson . 44 caliber revolver .
the same weapon ... ... he used to viciously murder george and carol beeman .
i would like to enter it into court records at this time .
thank you .
bailiff ?
thank you , mr. divinci .
at this time , the prosecution would like to recall mr. steven j. allen .
call steven j. allen .
could you remind the court as to what you do , please ?
sure .
i' m a lab technician for the police department .
one of my duties is to examine weapons used in violent crimes .
i tested the defendant' s revolver and matched the bullets fired ... ... to those removed from the body of the deceased .
that ain' t my gun !
i must remind the defendant he is not to speak out .
that ain' t my gun !
order in the court !
that ain' t my fucking gun !
they' re trying to fucking frame me !
that ain' t my fucking gun !
we gotta put the right gun back .
we can' t put it back .
without that gun , they won' t convict joe .
without that , they' il let clyde back out !
i don' t give a fuck about clyde !
i give a fuck about us right now !
look , it' s like you said .
he signed a confession , right ?
it' s an open and shut case .
i swear to god , frank ... ... if we let clyde get back on the streets , he' s gonna kill again .
how' d that little piece of fuckin ' puke know that wasn' t his damn gun ?
tell me that !
i don' t think he knows his own mother , but he knows his own fucking gun ?
bullshit !
i don' t think that' s important right now .
i know it' s not important !
open up .
sorry , divinci , can' t do it .
what do you mean you can' t ?
i gotta check something .
you got written permission ?
since fuckin ' when ?
since an hour ago , when he ripped me a new asshole big as a three car garage .
okay , what' s the problem ?
something about missing evidence .
who the hell knows ?
all i know is i want to transfer the hell out of here .
what are we supposed to do ?
how should i know ?
ask the fucking chief , all right ?
policy ain' t my department .
thanks a lot .
whenever you' re ready .
yes , we would like to plead not guilty ... ... to the charge of murder for reason of insanity .
but i did it .
let me handle this .
i signed the confession .
don' t worry , i' m the attorney .
all right ?
let me handle it .
your honor , can we have a moment , please ?
counsel may approach the bench .
my colleague' s client has admitted to the killing .
i don' t see any reason to go through a trial ... ... when it is obvious that the man would like to plead guilty .
i don' t agree .
if he wants to plead guilty , you have to let him .
not if he' s not of sound mind .
come on , elliot !
i think he' s crazy .
sure .
of course he is .
you think he' s putting it on .
that' s da' s standard procedure .
but i don' t think he is .
so i' m standing by the not guilty ... ... because i believe he' s incapable of sound judgment .
have you had a psychiatrist look at him ?
yes , your honor .
i think you' il see that my diagnosis is not without warrant .
i' il review the findings and make my decision tomorrow .
thank you , your honor .
thank you .
besides , i hear there' s a good chance of beating the charges for lack of evidence .
nobody can connect us to the evidence .
we' re clean there .
the most important one is the dea mess , anyway .
once that' s finished , we' re completely in the clear .
you know we can' t do this anymore , frank .
yeah .
i guess .
no .
no fucking " i guess . " that' s it .
no more !
good while it lasted , though . $100, 000 a piece for a few nights ' work ?
that' s not bad .
you know , frank ... ... i think maybe what we did wasn' t right .
i mean ...
come on , man .
think about it .
look , we took out a few scumbags .
that' s it , right ?
nobody' s ever gonna miss those shitheads anyway .
they were all garbage .
none of them had a sheet less than a mile long .
drugs , extortion , assault .
they were all guilty and still on the street , and you know that .
all except the cop .
except the cop .
that' s just part of the job .
it could have easily happened to you or me .
but that' s just fucking it .
we are fucking cops .
we fucked up , man .
we fucked up once .
once out of 10 .
come on , that' s not bad .
all right , i' m sorry , okay ?
i' m sorry .
the guy was in the wrong place at the wrong fuckin ' time .
what do you want me to say ?
i' m not going down for it .
i know .
i mean , all i want in life is a goddamn fishing boat ... ... a couple of drinks , a beach and some hawaiian music .
that' s not much to ask for 20 years putting murdering assholes behind bars , is it ?
it' s just not fair .
that' s all i' m saying .
and for a while , we made it fair .
and quit thinking you' re a bad guy .
you' re not a fucking bad guy .
all right ?
you made one mistake .
let it go .
i guess you' re right .
damn right , i' m right .
i just get worried , that' s all .
worry !
worry .
it' s natural .
you should be worried a little bit .
shit , if you didn' t worry , i' d be worried .
just don' t ever lose your sense of humor .
sense of humor .
they' re all garbage .
nothing wrong with taking out the garbage .
a lot of people don' t know that .
the defendant will stand and face the jury .
what is your verdict ?
we find the defendant , clyde david dunner , not guilty .
yes !
fuckin ' a , man .
thank you !
thank you !
and you haven' t seen him any time since then ?
all right .
we gotta talk .
could you hold on one second , please ?
calm down .
i heard .
clyde walked , right ?
no .
joe' s going to fucking trial .
judge found him mentally unfit to plead .
his lawyer pleads not guilty by reason of insanity .
you' re fuckin ' kidding me .
i love to make people laugh .
that' s my life' s work .
did you hear the one about the two cops who popped a dea agent ?
i' il call you right back .
hello ?
divinci .
it' s gardner .
sorry to call you so late , but ... ... i got a really stressed out woman here .
said she needs to talk to you about a murder .
i told her i couldn' t call you at home , but she insists that it' s very important .
you know , it' s the " life and death " thing .
what' s her name ?
all right .
tell her to wait .
i' il be right there .
shit .
what the hell are you doing ?
i got to go down to the station .

frank , this is no way to repair our marriage , you know ?
yeah , i know .
approximate weight ?

gardner , this her ?
yeah .
how do you do ?
this way .
frank , this guy came ...
not now .
i thought you said all i had to do was pick him out ... ... and that was all .
what are you talking about ?
look !
they want me in court !
this is not what you promised , frank .
i can' t go to court .
i can' t do this , frank .
i cannot go to court .
i can' t do this .
i' m getting out of here .
i gotta go .
you' re not getting out of here .
get in .
shut up .
fuck !
i can' t do this , frank !
calm the fuck down !
no !
i told you i can' t do this !
i warned you about this !
calm the fuck down for a second !
this was not supposed to happen !
just calm down !
let me think for a second !
fine .
think .
think away .
think away .
all right .
here .
they want you to be a witness .
that' s all , okay ?
there' s nothing to worry about .
you saw something happen .
what , frank ?
what did i see ?
i will tell you everything you gotta know .
everything .
i will tell you exactly what to say .
just like another stage .
it' s like dancing .
hi , joe .
you look much better .
jail has been good for me .
trial date is set for thursday .
i just wanted to go over ...
i' ve been thinking about what i did , and i don' t think that it' s right ... ... that i should try getting off .
excuse me ?
i wanna plead guilty .
i killed a man .
i should be punished .
i' m a little surprised .
why ?
nobody ever wants to be punished for what they' ve done .
that is a totally new concept for me , believe me .
but listen , i still think our defense is reasonable .
i don' t believe , under the condition you were in ... ... that you were responsible for your actions .
then why was i carrying a gun ?
i had no right to carry a gun .
if you hadn' t been , you might be dead .
and he might still be alive .
i underst ...
can i think about this , please ?
no .
i' ve made up my mind .
joe ...
no , i didn' t know him .
i used to see him in the neighborhood .
where were you standing ?
what if she takes off ?
then we got no goddamn witness puts him at the scene .
yeah , but what if she testifies and nobody fuckin ' believes her ?
perjury , maybe .
that' s a 50 50 .
they might believe her .
she' s a fucking stripper , for christ' s sake .
nobody' s gonna believe her .
look , she' s got ...
what the fuck ?
i don' t believe her when she tells the truth .
what ?
we got two bodies out here .
so ?
three more in the house .
so ?
i just wondered if you' re gonna be the primary on this .
yeah , we' re coming .
just give us some room .
come on !
look , frank , she could blow this whole thing .
she could tie us in .
that would be it , we' d be fucked .
all right .
if it looks like she' s gonna crumble , we' il take steps .
what steps ?
steps .
one more chalk outline in the city , more or less .
who' s gonna notice ?
shit , frank .
come on , man .
you think i like this ?
you know , you just can' t go around killing everybody .
wait just a second .
look around .
what do we got ?
we got two stiffs on the pavement , shot to shit , three more inside .
that' s five chalk outlines in one day ... ... in one deal , in one neighborhood , in one city .
just let me fill you in on some fuckin ' statistics here , okay ?
we' re not killing everybody !
look , it' s strictly last resort , all right ?
let' s not kid ourselves .
push comes to shove , somebody' s going down .
if you got another candidate , i' m willing to listen .
come on .
let' s do some work .
what ?
there' s a body here .
he' s dead .
there' s the other one .

you know , i wanted to make sure there were no bodies lying around .
sure .

of course .
all right .
i' il see you in court .
right .
all right .
yeah , it' s open .
elliot goff ?

you' re here to see me ?
yes .
william .
yes .
i waited till 3 : 00 , but she never showed .
so what are you telling me ?
that she missed the appointment ?
forgot you were coming ?
what ?
my guess ?
she split .
she split ?
our witness split ?
can' t we keep our evidence and witnesses from disappearing around here ?
i mean , what do i have to do , lock them in the trunk of my car ?
what the fuck is going on ?
i want that bitch back here and on the stand or in jail !

look , i heard what the fuck you said .
now , you want me to find her ?
you need to tell me why the fuck she left , so i know where not to look , all right ?
all right , she' s supposed to testify .
she got scared .
she thinks somebody might try to kill her .
that' s why i want you to find her .
because if someone' s trying to pop her , i don' t want anyone knowing where she is .
so how long i got ?

i always like to help out the fucking police whenever possible .
isn' t that arthur baylor ?

hear ye , hear ye , all rise .
face the flag and recognize the principles for which it stands .
criminal court , department g , is now in session .
the honorable howard w. pine presiding .
please be seated and come to order .
<i>the pe</ i>o<i>ple v. j</ i>o<i>e d</ i>o<i>e</ i> ... ... in case number c9524705 .
before we proceed ... ... i must ask the defense if there' s anything this court should be made aware of .
yes , your honor .
i have joined the defense ... ... in the representation of mr. william daine mccall ... ... otherwise known to this court as joe doe .
i represented the mccall family for several years ... ... before mr. mccall disappeared seven years ago .
it was assumed that he had died ... ... but since he has reappeared under these tragic circumstances ... ... i would ask the court for a continuance to allow the defense to prepare ... ... in the light of his real identity now being known .
how long do you need ?
one week should be sufficient .
any objection to a week' s continuance by the state ?
i don' t ... ... believe so , your honor .
then i grant a one week' s continuance .
we' il start the proceedings next monday morning .

william mccall shunned the business world ...
... and turned his life to medicine ...
... receiving his medical degree from harvard in 1969 .
once again , he turned his back on the established norm ...
... and spent several years in africa ...
... performing organ transplants for the poor .
this is who you picked ?
this is who you fucking picked ?
you picked a surgeon who performs transplants on the poor in africa ?
he was living on the fucking streets !
how was i supposed to know he' s a goddamn doctor ?
he' s not a fucking doctor .
you picked a saint to pin a murder on !
god !
when we pick them , we sure do pick them .
why didn' t you get the pope and pin it on him ?
disappeared seven years ago on september 19th ...
... two weeks after the tragic death of his wife and two young children ...
... in a multiple vehicle accident .
at the same time , it was assumed that he had returned to africa ...
... but that was never confirmed .
what mr. mccall has been doing for seven years ...
... is now the mystery that the court will try to help unravel .
shit .
let' s just think about it for a second .
yeah , let' s .
what' s the worst case scenario ?
what , are you joking me ?
no .
are you playing ?
what' s worse than what we' ve done that could still happen ?
or what' s worse if this doesn' t work out , blows up in our face ... ... we go to jail , sent to the electric chair , then we die , then we go to fucking hell ?
worse than that ?
will you work with me here ?
excuse me , i' m having a bad morning .
maybe you could excuse me .
would you repeat the question ?
all right , doc walks .
there' s nothing to connect us to the evidence .
there' s one person who can connect us to him .
i don' t even want to argue about it anymore .
let' s just fucking kill her .
frank ?
all right , let' s do it .
we need to talk .
man , are you fucking with me ?
i' m not fucking with you .
are you fucking with me ?
hold on .
you don' t know ?
know what ?
this isn' t good .
what ?
you' re a cop , and you don' t even know .
come on , knock it off .
what ?
the cops got her .
ain' t that a bitch ?
you a cop , and you got to come to me to find out ?
this is a crazy fucking world we' re living in , man .
what fucking cops ?
what cops ?
i don' t know what cops !
all i know is my people went to her sister' s house ... ... and she had already left .
her sister said cops took her .
i figured it was you .
fuck !
fuck !
shit .
what an asshole !
you' re a good judge of character .
look , she' s our goddamn witness ... ... and if she' s in custody , somebody better fucking tell me !
try to get at me as soon as you can .
all right .
anything ?
nothing .
nobody knows nothing .
da doesn' t know anything .
the dea doesn' t know shit from shinola .
if she' s being held by the police , we' d know .
unless she said something .
no , she didn' t say anything , or we wouldn' t be sitting here .
it was that piece of shit .

don' t ever lie to me again .

the people v. william mccall ... <i> ...
in case number 9524705 . </ i>
... when he pulled this gun and fired at agent hudd ... ... killing him instantly .
a smith & wesson . 44 caliber handgun .
all these . 44s are starting to look the same to me .
so when you arrested the defendant , did he deny having killed agent hudd ?
no .
can you describe the defendant' s condition at the time of his arrest ?
yes .
he was drunk .
we could smell the booze on him , but we drew blood , and he did not object .
we have the blood test report showing ... ... that he had four times the legal limit to drive .
but you knew that this was the man that you were looking for ?
yes , sir .
based on what ?
based on his description .
and who provided you with that description ?
a miss cynthia ... ... something .
i don' t know .
i' m not sure .
i believe her name is cynthia webb .
cynthia webb .
at least ... ... based on the statement filed the night she picked him out of the lineup .
now , is that name familiar to you ?
yes , that' s her .
and where did you find miss webb ?
on the same street .
same area .
and she agreed to pick the defendant out of the lineup ?
yes .
were you aware that miss webb disappeared ... ... after she was served with a subpoena ?
yes .
my partner and i ... ... tried to contact her about the case ... ... but we were unsuccessful in our attempts .
thank you , detective .
that' s all the questions i have .
i' m gonna tell you right now , you did a great job .
don' t come down on yourself .
here .
to justice in all its forms .
we' re not out of the woods yet , buddy .
without miss webb , there' s no place they can go .
we still got the confession , the gun , the ballistics ... ... and i don' t care about all this african doctor crap .
the man is a fucking drunk .
he' s been a fucking drunk for seven goddamn years .
let' s have a drink for drunks .
to drunks .
i just wish i knew where the fuck she was .
so ... ... i think we' il have to rely on his confession ... ... for a description of what happened , because he' s never gonna take the stand .
da' s office .
what ?
when ?
where ...
they found cynthia webb .
what ?
where ?
i don' t know .
when ?
i don' t know .
who the hell was that ?
i don' t know , i don' t know .
they hung up .
what the hell is going on around here ?
i don' t know .
you don' t need to say nothing , but are you really a doctor ?
i was .
a surgeon .
no shit !
no shit !
really ?
a surgeon ?
i know i' m nobody to judge , but you must' ve been a smart guy .
what the hell are you doing in here ?
i had an affair with another woman .
a nurse at the hospital that i worked at .
it was ... ... something .
i don' t remember much about her , except that my wife found out about it .
we had a fight .
she left the house , she took the kids .
she was hysterical .
i should' ve done something ... ... gone after them , i don' t know .
they died in a car accident about a mile from the house .
i never told anybody that .
your honor , the people would like to call miss cynthia webb to the stand .
the court calls cynthia webb .
raise your right hand .
do you swear to tell the truth , the whole truth ... ... and nothing but the truth , so help you god ?
sure .
i know her .
she' s the woman who identified you .
no , no , i mean , i know her .
how ?
i don' t know .
i think i lived near her .
could you please state your name for the court ?
cynthia webb .
do you recognize the man that you identified in a police lineup ?
yes .
is he anywhere in this courtroom ?
yes .
is it the defendant , mr. mccall ?
yes .
could you please describe for us what you saw on the night of june 14 ?
<i>i was c</ i>o<i>mlng</ i> o<i>ut</ i> o<i>f thls</ i> <i>all nlght mlnl mart . </ i>
how sure are you ... ... that the man you saw with the gun is the defendant ?
i' m sure .
thank you .
no further questions .
miss webb ...
is it " miss " ?
yes .
miss webb ... ... had you ever seen the defendant before that night you just described ?
no .
do you know what perjury is ?
when you lie .
when you lie under oath in a court of law .
do you know what the penalty for that is ?
you go to jail .
yes .
cynthia ... ... did you ever see the defendant before that night ?
objection .
the witness answered that question , your honor .
sustained .
i' m just trying to give the witness the opportunity to remember ... ... if she ever saw mr. mccall ... ... any other time before the night in question .
miss webb , do you understand the consequences of perjury ?
yes .
let' s get on with it then .
what did you buy when you went into the mini mart ?
what did i buy ?
you remembered seeing mr. mccall .
you remembered a gunshot and the car crash .
i just wondered if you remembered what you bought in the mini mart .
shampoo , i think .
that' s all ?
yeah .
where do you live ?
435617th street , no .
4 .
is that close to this mini mart ?
close ?
sort of .
how far would you say ?
i don' t really know .
is it walking distance ?
not really .
did you walk there that night or drive ?
i drove .
you drove ?
but when you left the mini mart , you said you walked along the street .
yes .
how far ?
to the corner .
objection , your honor .
i don' t see the point to this line of reasoning .
is there a point ?
yes , your honor .
since this is the only witness ... ... i' m just trying to establish what the scene was like that night .
try to get there as quickly as possible .
thank you , sir .
how far from the corner was this mini mart ?
i mean , was it in the middle of the block ?
close to the corner ?
in the middle , i think .
so you walked all the way to the corner ?
i assume you were going back to your car ?
yes .
any reason you parked so far away ?
there were a lot of cars on the street that night .
any other people on the street ?
no .
lots of cars , no people .
any traffic ?
i don' t really remember .
so you were the only person who saw joe on the street that night ?
i didn' t see anybody else .
so you heard a gunshot .
you heard a car crash .
you saw joe running past with a gun in his hand .
what did you do then ?
call the police , 911 ?
i went home .
you went home ?
straight home ?
yes .
so you' re sure it was joe you saw that night ?
yes .
when you went home ?
yes .
when you went home , you saw joe ?
no .
objection , your honor .
the defense is trying to confuse the witness .
i' m not trying to confuse the witness .
the witness is trying to confuse this court .
and i have witnesses who will refute her testimony ... ... who were on the corner the night of the shooting ... ... who never saw miss webb , who never heard a gunshot ... ... who never saw joe running past .
now , miss webb saw joe outside of her building that night ... ... because he lives in the alley next door .
isn' t that true ?
objection !
when i referred to the defendant as joe ... ... you knew exactly who i was talking about , didn' t you ?
now , this trial is <i>the pe</ i>o<i>ple v. wililam mccall</ i> ... ... not " joe .
the name joe has never been mentioned in this trial ... ... so how did you know who i was talking about ?
miss webb ?
how do you know the defendant as joe ?
he lived in the alley next to my apartment building .
shit .
why did you lie to this court ?
i don' t know .
are you afraid of somebody ?
i don' t know .
are you trying to protect somebody ?
i don' t know .
answer the questions , miss webb , or i' il be forced to cite you for contempt .
she didn' t talk .
don' t hold your breath .
do you think she' s gonna talk ?
i know she' s gonna talk .
we can make it look gang related .
the problem is , we' re gonna need another gun .
the problem is , she' s in fucking jail .
that' s the goddamn problem .
yeah .
since when is being in jail ever a guarantee of a long life ?
just get another gun .
wake up , manny .
get up .
i didn' t do anything .
everything' s fine , everything' s fine .
i just came to apologize , but i need a little privacy here .
come on , come on , come on .
move !
i need a favor .
i need you to bail somebody out of jail .
bail' s $25, 000 .
you gotta be kidding .
now , look , i want her out tonight .
i do not want you to tell her who .
it' s a surprise .
so how am i supposed to pay for this ?
you know , they don' t take american express .
i know you know how to get rid of this .
there' s a lot more than $25, 000 here .
you keep the change .
but i want her out in two hours .
otherwise , i' il come back and nail you for possession .
how' d you get to be such a prick ?
dna .
asshole .
i got your dna .
did you get the gun ?
yeah , i got it .
what' s with you ?
you all right ?
everything okay ?
what ?
are you kidding me ?
what ?
what ?
we' re going to kill a witness ... ... who' s in jail because we killed a fucking dea agent .
this kind of shit troubles me .
i' m sorry , frank .
take off the fucking dress and get back in the game , will you ?
shake it off .
come on .
we got to do what we got to do .
that' s it .
yeah .
i know .
we got to do what we got to do .
that' s right .
let' s just get it over with .
i don' t understand .
why can' t you tell me who bailed me out ?
the man comes to me and tells me to bail you out .
he gives me cash , i do it .
it' s what i do for a living .
i bail people out of jail , all right ?
you stay with me .
was he a cop ?
right .
cops bail people out all the time .
ain' t there some kind of dichotomy in that shit for you ?
i don' t like this .
look , you can either stay here in jail , or you can come with me .
shit , the choice is yours .
just tell me , what did he look like ?
you are a stripper , right ?
guys fall in love with your type all the time ... ... but they don' t know how to get close .
you know ?
baby , somebody wants you to owe them something .
you take that shit or leave it .
fuck !
this is the last time , frank .
the last time we kill somebody .
yeah .
it' s the last time .
i mean ... ... eleven is enough .
eleven dead bodies is enough .
i get the picture .
damn , man .
why' d you have to go and kill hudd ?
what' s going on here ?
what' s the matter ?

i think you know my client is innocent .
that' s all i care about , my client .
but i understand why you' re scared .
you' re already facing perjury charges , and my guess is that ... ... you' re in this a lot deeper .
but i' m not after you .
i get nothing if you go to jail .
but i think that if i help you ... ... you could help my client .
how ?
sit down , please .
william ...
joe ... ... didn' t really do it , did he ?
no .
no , he didn' t .
no goddamn way .
i' m won' t grant that whore immunity .
she lied on the stand .
she' s protecting somebody .
and she' s involved .
i want them all .
all right .
before i leave , i want to remind you of something .
you have shit for a case .
if you cared about seeing justice for your dead comrade ... ... you wouldn' t blow this deal .
immunity for her testimony is a small price for a bad cop .
and that' s the only way she' s gonna talk .
and william mccall walks right now .
all charges dropped .
if what she says is any good , i' il deal .
if it isn' t , nobody goes anywhere .
cynthia , sit down , please .
how does it feel to be a free man again ?
do you have any comments , sir ?
sorry , no more questions .
no more questions .
thank you .
thank you !
guess you had no choice .
you had to do the right thing .
baby , look at you .
what do you want ?
what do i want ?
you' re asking me what i want ?
are you gonna grant me three wishes ?
let' s see ... ... i don' t know what to ask for .
money would be nice .
love would be better .
but a little fucking ioyalty ... ... you can never get enough of that .
we' il start with money .
that' s all i' ve got .
they' il catch you .
no .
they don' t got a clue , baby .
you know why ?
' cause i' m following my heart ... ... and they don' t know where that is .
what about your plans ?
why don' t you tell me about your fucking plans ?
maybe i' d like to hear them now .
plans .
plans ?
once a ioyalty' s broken , baby , you can never get it back .
you should not have told them .
there are a lot of things in my life that i shouldn' t have done .
but that is not fucking one of them !
move out of my way !
let me tell you something .
the only difference between a witness and a liar ... ... is just one of them knows what he' s doing .
no !
shit !
manny , lock the door .
lock it !
you scared the shit out of me .
shit .
manny .
one more favor .
now , since when did i become such a good fucking friend ?
look , i' m thinking of taking a little time off .
think you can get me a car tonight ?
yeah , man .
i can do that .
but you know you' re hot as hell right now , right ?
and drivers that don' t talk ... ... don' t come cheap .
i got the money .
make it happen .
