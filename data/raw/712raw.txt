after months of speculation analysts expect an announcement this week that globecom lnternational will acquire waterman publishing and its flagship magazine , sports america .
the man at the helm of globecom , billionaire media magnate teddy k. has been on a spending spree recently , acquiring a food service company , a cable operator and two telecommunications providers in deals totaling more than $13 billion .
and how did one lucky ferret owner come to own the largest dog treat manufacturer on the east coast ?

mr. kalb .
dan .
thanks for the lakers tickets .
you bet .
seats were terrific .
but i' m still not going to advertise in the magazine .
my son in law tells me that people don' t read much anymore .
too much effort moving the eyes back and forth .
so we' re gonna put most of our budget into television , radio , lnternet .
okay .
okay " ?
what does that mean ?
l' m not gonna try to sell you .
why the hell not ?
you' re a salesman .
yeah .
just not a very good one , that' s all .
l' il say .
but i am gonna ask you one favor .
oh , yeah ?
l' m gonna leave you an issue of the magazine .
and i' m personally gonna send you a new one every week .
now , i' il call you in a few weeks , and if you want to , we' il talk .
there' s a great article in there comparing today' s quarterbacks with johnny unitas .
unitas would kick their butts .
so , this is your sales pitch ?
l' ve been with the magazine for 20 years .
i believe in it .
well , good for you .
so , are you worried about all these rumors that your parent company is about to be sold ?
no , not really .
l don' t see how it would affect us .
well , hopefully it won' t .
you know , that teddy k. character offered to buy my business a few years ago .
i told him to go screw himself .
my son in law says i' m a dinosaur .
don' t knock dinosaurs .
they ruled the earth for millions of years .
they must' ve been doing something right simply put , we are never gonna be able to reach this significant , untapped market , until we learn to think like them .
ln point of fact ,
less than . 05 percent of all cell phone users are under the age of 5 years old .
that' s why we have the t rex phone and the triceratops phone , and the pterodactyl phone .
' cause it' s gonna change all of that and each one of these phones has its own unique ring .

teddy k. has an ... has a thing that what makes globecom great is the men and women of globecom .
ls it like a thousand degrees in here or is it me ?
it' s like ...
lt' s me .
i have an agenda .
and you' re gonna learn this about me .
i' m a machine .
what was i saying about the ... an agenda .
an agenda , i have an agenda .
which is that i have to immediately , um , increase the ad pages here by 20 percent .
20 percent ?
carter , only a startup magazine can do that .
yeah , well , i think this team can do it , dan .
um , how ?
well , morty , basically what we
god , that' s an awesome question .
how ?
and the answer
is synergy .
we need to team up here .
yeah , we need to synchronize and we need to synergize .
we' re not alone .
we' re not alone .
we' re part of one of the biggest multimedia and brand name companies in the known universe , okay ?
let' s let' s take advantage of that , like , uh ...
like ...
krispity krunch .
did anyone know that , uh , one of our sister companies is krispity krunch ?
so ?
so we talk to our brothers and sisters over at krispity krunch .
we make a deal where we supply sports factoids to their boxes .
so that when joe couch potato is sitting there , he' s , uh , snacking , he looks down , and what does he see ?
sports america krispity krunch sports factoids .
he' s definitely buying more krispity krunch and not krunch ' n krackle which , by the way , looks and tastes exactly the same .
but guess what ?
no sports factoids .
and krispity krunch is so happy they guarantee us 28 pages a year .
besides which , they know if they don' t ,
teddy k. is gonna be pissed .
what is that ?
what am i talking about here , people ?
synergy .
lsn' t that cheating ?
no , no .
hell , no .
and , uh , techline cell phones .
we own techline cell phones .
guess what we put on their browser ?
factoids .
yes !
factoids !
synergy !
and what else ?
uh , box scores .
and ads !
we make a deal like a 100, 000 hits on the lnternet has the equivalent value of one ad page of our hard copy .
are you getting it , people ?
the magazine has become just a portal to a synergized world of cross promotion .
we' re gonna bust things wide open .
we are gonna take things to the next level .
who' s with me ?
who' s with me ?
who who' s psyched ?
lou , are you psyched ?
yeah .
yeah , i' m psyched .
okay .
alicia , are you psyched ?
absolutely .

that' s cool .
hector ...
hector , i know you' re psyched .

my money' s on dan .
he' s prehistoric .

you should try some .
the spicy tuna here is money .
come here .
get that .
get that .
yeah , go fishing , man .
yeah .
yeah .
so i wanted to talk to you , [ grunting ]
because , uh ,
this is raw . ... an increase in ad pages is ...
well , it' s really only part of the equation in terms of achieving the bottom line my bosses want me to hit .
understand , teddy k. is making cuts across the board here .
ln point of fact , i have to cut $300, 000 salary from the sales team immediately .
l don' t make that much money , carter .
i know how much you make , dan .
well ,
l wish you' d told me that i was fired before i ate the goddamn fish .
oh , dan !
dan !
dan !
l' m i' m not letting you go here .
you' re not ?
no .
you are an excellent salesman .
you ran a good team .
i think that you have the potential to be an awesome wingman here .
an awesome wingman ?
b but , carter , i definitely see the benefit for you in having an awesome wingman .
but what is the benefit for me at this point in my career of being an awesome wingman ?
well , one benefit at this point in your career is that you get to keep your job .
that' s a pretty good benefit , don' t you think ?
really ?
really !
are you smiling ?
you' re smiling !
this is funny to you .
guess what ?
you have no idea what a nightmare you' re about to step into , my friend .
a hole !
we' il see how soon this place goes down the poop chute without me .
maybe there is justice in the world .
you enjoying yourselves ?
great .

honestly , i' m ... [ chuckling ]
l' m not .
just around you , for some reason .
people would probably say that i' m an emotionally guarded anal retentive asshole .
you wanna play foosball ?
okay .
cool , i' il just change .
okay .
good .
yeah .
do you think alex could cope with living in the city on her own ?
well , i' m less worried about her coping with it than i am about you .
yeah , well , frankly , i' d rather keep her under house arrest with a homing device around her ankle .
then why did you agree to it without even talking to me ?
and why is your teenage boss here ?
and why am i so nauseous ?
i hardly had any morning sickness the first two times .
hey , hey , hey ! and i' m so sick of it !
calm down .
let me have that .
l' m not really that into tennis anymore .
what i' m really not into is being the jock .
you know , it' s like people don' t even invite me to their parties because they think i' m in training or something .
also , there' s this rumor going around that i' m a lesbian .
man , that sucks .
or not .
i don' t ...
not being a lesbian .
yeah , well , i' m not .
lt' d be one thing if i wanted to go pro and make a ton of money , but i' m not at that level .
l' ve played girls at that level and i' m not .
l mean , not that i' d want that , really .
their lives have peaked by the time they' re like 21 .
oh , nice .
i wonder that about myself sometimes , too .
like maybe my life has peaked at 26 .
maybe it' s all downhill from here .
well , it probably is .
yeah .
here you go .
keep the change .
dinner' s ready !
l' m on an important call !
with who ?
my boyfriend .

lt' s from a wonderful little ltalian restaurant called domino' s .
so , are you really dad' s new boss ?
we' re not , uh , we' re really more colleagues .

he' s the boss man .
i' m the wingman .

you' re wearing a wedding ring .
um , yes , i am , sort of .
um , or ...

and it' s official .
you' re divorced .
okay , two things .
first , steckle is organizing a company basketball league .
l' m gonna be sales team captain .
you are my new power forward .
and second , i heard you' re taking the guys from rums jamaica to the knicks game on wednesday night ?
yeah .
you have to run that stuff by me , man .
run it by you ?
they' re my clients .
no , they' re not , dan .
they' re globecom clients .
that' s why we' re gonna be takin ' ' em to the globecom luxury suite .
well , these aren' t luxury suite type of guys .
dan , everyone' s a luxury suite type of guy .
uh , we can' t go there on wednesday , because teddy k. is hosting bill clinton , jay z , and kofi annan .
we' re gonna do it thursday .
l' il bring them to a concert .
look , i gotta get these guys to up their buy by 18 pages .
we gotta start kicking some ass here .
l' m gonna have to let some people go .
why do you say " let them go " ?
they don' t want to go .
why don' t you just say , " fire them " ?
because it sounds better .
not to the person getting fired , it doesn' t .
# you wanna get with me ? # # put ' em up #
# take long trips with me # # yeah #
this guy was shot 1 2 times and pronounced legally dead .
hence the name .
someone should tell him it' s spelled d e a d.
they' re afraid to .
he' s got the number one hit single right now .
he' s a protege of 50 cent .
why don' t they just call him " nickel " ?
what ?
20 years , your jokes still haven' t improved .
want you guys to meet my colleague .
this is petey from k jam sneakers .
hey , hey .
hmm .
cross promotional idea .
you buy a certain amount of jamaican rum , boom .
you get a discount on running shoes .
done .
yeah , sounds like a great fit .
get a lot of drunk people running around .
dan .
you want to go get some air ?
yeah .
be back in a bit .
word .
hey , not too long .
we got chimichangas on the way .
# you wanna get with me ?
take long trips with me ##
sorry about the concert .
they wouldn' t let me just get regular seats for the knicks game .
no , it' s okay .
look , dan .
i' ve been instructed not to advertise with sports america anymore .
what ?
we were bought out last year by this company called continental brands .
apparently , the company that bought us and the company that bought you are having a feud over wireless communications in europe .
wireless communications ?
what what the hell does that have to do with our business ?
nothing .
but we have this corporate policy now .
look , i' m sorry , dan .
## [ music playing ]
dan , i have to fire louie and morty .
no , you don' t .
i do .
we' re gonna get those ad pages back .
we' il get those ...
oh , my god !
it' s like you don' t get it or something .
that was a huge client .
steckle gave me a bottom line here .
i have to increase pages .
we already got harry , pete , and alicia on the ford account .
morty' s the logical choice .
oh , and the new woman at pepsi thinks that louie' s a sexist .
guess why .
he called her " sugar tits .
he' s an idiot .
come on , you can' t fire these guys .
these are my guys .
they' ve been with me for eight years .
i hired them at the same time .
yeah , i know , dan .
that' s why they have huge , bloated salaries .
and they' re not pulling their weight .
l' m sorry .
well , i' ve been here for 23 years .
my salary' s bigger than theirs .
why don' t you just fire me ?
do you want me to fire you ?
because i could , dan .
you have a family that loves you .
you have a kid on the way .
l look at you sometimes and it' s like ...
you have people who need you .
do you really wanna put them in jeopardy for louie and morty ?

i should be the one to do it .
guys , i feel really terrible about what i' m about to say .
but i' m afraid you' re both being let go .
let go ?
what does that mean ?
lt means you' re being fired , louie .
believe me , if i had any choice in this , i would ...
anyway , i thought you should hear it from me because i' m the one who hired you .
oh .
wait a minute .
are you being fired , too ?
no , no .
uh ... [ clearing throat ]
this isn' t my decision .
oh , so it' s not your decision , so therefore it' s not your fault , right ?
l didn' t say that .
you know , this is bullshit .
louie .
no , no , morty .
you know something ?
i look at you like a brother .
l would' ve stood in front of a bus for you , you piece of shit !
you' ve turned into a real corporate asshole , you know that , dan ?
louie .
do me a favor .
lf you see my friend dan , tell him i' m looking for him .
louie !
dan , what the hell am i gonna tell my wife ?
i mean , she already wears the pants .
now she' s gonna wear the tie and jacket , too .
morty , i am so very sorry .
i know this must have been hard for you , dan .
you were a good boss .
i mean it .
you always treated everyone with respect .
and i ...
look , i appreciate it .
what' s this ?
my 360 evaluation .
uh , you rated yourself , " does not meet expectations .
yeah .
l' m gonna cry .

l' m renting an apartment in tribeca .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .

do you drink coffee ?
no !
uh , normally i just hook up to an lv , actually .
my , you sure can pound back the caffeine , huh ?
ls that why your leg is shaking like that ?
i think it is .
yeah .
you' re not wearing your wedding band .
oh .
yeah .
i' m now officially the first person in my high school class to get divorced .
oh , i' m sorry .
no , it' s okay .
when i think about it honestly , it was pretty much coming since our second date .
how' s ...
how are you ?
how' s school going ?
lt' s pretty good .
lt' s pretty good .
i mean , you know , it' s , it' s , uh ... it' s hard to meet new people as a transfer .
everybody' s got their own little cliques and they' re not sure if they want to admit one more .
but , uh , my creative writing classes are really great .
oh , yeah , creative writing ?
yeah .
i' ve just , uh ...
l' ve always been interested in stories and escaping into other people' s lives .
l guess ' cause mine always seems so boring .
l' m cursed with a functional family .
but writing isn' t exactly practical .
so i think i might double major in business .
oh , no .
don' t do that .
stick with the creative writing .
strange , you know , sometimes you seem sort of bummed out about your career , but you' re so successful .
no , i' m not bummed .
uh ...
god , my career is pretty much what i have in my life .
that and a dented porsche , right ?
your family must be really proud of you .
my mom is .
you know , she' s ...
she' s this kind of hippie .
so she' s not really into the corporate thing .
and my dad left home when i was 4 , so , you know , i never really got to know him .
his family had money , but , uh , he was this kind of artist you know , in quotes , slash druggy .
uh , he was in this cult for a while .
do you , do you ...
let' s get out of here .

well , my oldest daughter , she won' t call me back .
and i feel like going down to nyu and kidnapping her so i can stop worrying about her .
that sounds like a really bad idea .

l don' t think you have to worry about her too much .
she' s a smart , terrific woman .
girl .
or smart young lady .
whatever .
what i' m trying to say is that , uh ,
i think she can probably take care of herself .
dan , you seem to have the perfect marriage .
how do you do it ?
you just pick the right one to be in the foxhole with and then when you' re outside of the foxhole , you keep your dick in your pants .

but i' ve been thinking about it a lot lately , and it' s how i feel .
it' s really important to me
oh , that' s really sweet .
well , i mean it .
i know you probably think you do .
but l i' ve been doing a lot of thinking , too , and i' m taking anthropology classes .
and i' m doing a double major .

and i' m just ...
i' m really busy .
yeah .
uh , i' m just not ...
l' m not ready for a big commitment .
yes , that' s ... [ chuckles ]
that' s what i' m saying .
look , when i said i loved you ,
l didn' t mean that i wanted to interfere in your classes or , you know , whatever .
l' m not talking about marriage or anything yet .
carter .
look .
l' ve had an amazing time with you , and i think you' re a great guy .
but you are on the rebound .
no , i' m not .
carter , you are .
i mean , it was not that long ago that your wife left you .
best thing that ever happened to me .
well , that' s great .
but then that' s a good thing whether you' re with me or not .
i think we should stop seeing each other .
alex .
alex , come on .
i just want you to know
i enjoyed talking to you more than maybe anyone in my entire life .
thank you .
me , too .
dad , where have you been ?
your cell phone was off .
i tried to call you like a thousand times .
what happened ?
where' s your mom ?
there you are .
are you okay ?
l' m fine .
yes , i' m fine .
the baby' s fine .
i had a little scare .
there was some bleeding .
what ?
what is it ?
a placenta previa .
lt sounds bad , but , uh , it' s okay .
i just need some rest .
lf anything ever happened to you , i' d just have to pack it in .
oh , i' m afraid you' re going to be stuck with me for a while .
how' s she doing ?
she' s okay .
you know , i broke up with carter .
because of me ?
no .
because of me .
l' m sorry i lied to you .
but , you know , i think you should know that carter didn' t try to seduce me or anything .
lf anything , it was the other way around .
l really don' t want to hear the details .
i mean , unless you want to tell me , and ...
no .
no , not particularly .
good .
you must think i' m disgusting .
disgusting ?
why on earth would i think that ?
l didn' t know that you took out a second mortgage .
l don' t need to go to nyu .
suny' s fine .
it' s fine .
no , no , you are staying at nyu .
look , alex .

mark steckle .

hi .

how are you ?
good to see you .
thank you .
carter duryea .
oh , yes .
cell phones .
yes .
thank you .
l' m at sports america now .
well , that' s the flagship .
what happened to your eye ?
yeah , what happened there ?
i fell i fell asleep at my computer .
just kind of banged right into the monitor .
those things can be dangerous .
keep up the good work .
l wouldn' t be surprised if he announces another big takeover today .
teddy k. !
great to see you .
thank you .
thank you .
synergy .
what does it mean ?
why does a business swim with it and sink without it , in this new ocean of megabytes , streaming video and satellites ?
every day , the world becomes more complex .
and to survive in a complex world , we need complex bonds to interface with it .
ln this room ,
i see this .
what we' re trying to get to , is this .
this is unbreakable .
this is inevitable .
what are we building here ?
ls it a company ?
or are we building a new country with no national boundaries ?
a new democracy for the consumer .
a new democracy with a new electorate .
24 hour music videos in kuala lumpur .
computers with parts manufactured in japan ,
greenland , ldaho , lndia .
a soft drink ad going out simultaneously to seven different continents .
the dalai llama eating his krispity krunch while uploading prayers onto the net .
woman' s world magazine .
well , why not woman' s world channel across the world ?
computers .
why not a computer section in sports america magazine ?
uh , excuse me .
excuse me .
yes ?
uh , uh ...
uh , my name is , uh , uh , dan foreman .
i ...
l work for sports america and i' m not sure
l i understand what you' re talking about .
w what i mean is is what do computers have to do with sports ?
are you ...
are are you literally saying that there should be a section in the magazine about computers ?
who' s going to want to read that ?
um ... [ clears throat ]
and , uh ... [ sighs ]
l i' m not sure i understand how the way the world is changing is actually going to change how we do business .
we' re still selling a product , right ?
which hopefully someone needs .
we' re human beings with other human beings for customers .
so i don' t see how this company is like its own country .
i mean , just because we sell different kinds of things , that doesn' t mean we should operate by our own laws , does it ?
besides which , countries , at least democratic ones , they have some obligation to their citizens , don' t they ?
so how do layoffs and bottom line thinking fit into that ?
dan foreman .
sports america .
you ask some excellent questions .
excellent , excellent questions .
l' m glad you asked them .
and i' m leaving it to you , to all of you , to answer them .
hmm .
teddy k. !
teddy k. !
teddy k. !
oh , my god , dan .
oh , my god .
good , you' re both in here .
you , i' il talk to in a second .
you , have you lost your frigging mind ?
well , he said they were excellent questions .
okay , you think this is funny .
you think it' s funny to disrespect a great man .
do you know who you were just talking to in there ?
that was teddy k. !
teddy k. , god damn it !
look , we' ve been carrying your fat , bloated salary for way too long .
i want you out of this building within the next 10 minutes .
l' m going to my office .
l' m going to smoke a nice cuban cigar and try to forget that you ever existed .
you , in my office now .
mark , don' t do that .
excuse me ?
look .
the guy busts his ass and
and what ?
nothing .
i' m sorry .
i just ... lf you fire him ,
you' re going to have to fire me , too .
wait .
let me get something straight here .
you' re throwing yourself in with him ?
with this useless , over the hill loser ?
think here .
think about what you' re doing , because if you' re not careful , you could end up like him .
i guess that that would be okay .
all right .
then you' re fired , too , you little shit .
well , that' s too bad ,
' cause , uh , you' re gonna lose a huge account that dan and i' ve been working on .
it was gonna save the year for us .
without it , the magazine' s pretty deep in the red .
really ?
what account is that ?
you think we' d actually tell you ?
you' re bluffing .
l don' t bluff .
l' m not that good of a salesman .
yeah , well , i don' t give a crap .
i think teddy k. will .
see , i' m gonna call him and i' m gonna tell him that you single handedly drove his most profitable magazine , his flagship , right into the ground .
and he' il remember my name .
he likes what i did with cell phones .
you' ve got 24 hours , or you' re both gone .
any ideas ?
one .
you got all your research ?
yep .
follow my lead .
so , um , how are your daughters ?
they' re great .
thanks .
how about your grandkids ?
uh , they' re fine .
my son in law has just enrolled our oldest , ralphy , in a computer camp , whatever the hell that is .
uh , this is my boss , carter duryea .
lt' s a pleasure to meet you , mr. kalb .
you have a really awesome company here .
you ...
it' s a really awesome , awesome
your boss ?
he looks more like your nephew .
well , i' ve , uh , certainly been learning a lot from dan .
so what happened to your eye ?
that' s one of the things he learned from me .
are you saying that you punched him in the eye ?
why ?
well , it' s ...
we don' t have to really go into it here .
no , no , no , please , please .
i' m i' m i' m rather curious .
why did i hit you ?
he called me a dinosaur .
he said i was out of date .
that i' d better step in line .
so you slugged him ?
it was a fair fight .
hmm ?
right .
mr. kalb , we have a sister company , krispity krunch , that i think we could do a really exciting cross promotion with here , all in the globecom family .
carter , carter .
i think that we could achieve
carter , it' s ok .
mr. kalb ,
l don' t want get into facts and figures with you today .
you know them already .
i just want to ask you one question .
what is your hesitation about advertising with sports america magazine ?
my hesitation is that our ad budget is already overextended .
my son in law has put a lot of money into cable and online .
and now he wants to plow even more money back into it .
but ...
but what ?
but he is such an asshole !
i mean , i built this business .
i know more about running this than he ever will .
so , yeah .
i' m gonna make a major ad buy in your magazine .
and then i' m gonna restructure the whole damn ad campaign .
that is great news .
thank you , mr. kalb .
oh .
thank ...
yes .
thank you so much , sir .
you know , i don' t give a shit about krispity krunch .
let' s just stick with the magazine , okay ?
you really slugged him ?
yeah .
carter .
oh , my god .
oh , my god , that was amazing .
that was unbelievable !
god , that was actually fun .
what kalb really needed to see was an old fart who beat the crap out of a young punk half his age .
and you know what the best thing is ?
lt' s the right thing to do .
it will improve his business .
wow , you actually , uh ...
you actually believe in this stuff , huh ?
of course i do .
why else would i do it ?
hmm ?
hey , dan .
where you been ?
los angeles .
we made a huge sale .
congratulations .
so did teddy k.
he sold the company to calcor communications .
mark !
what happened ?
i thought you said teddy k. was buying another company .
that' s what they told me , but he sold us .
l' m out .
wait , you' re out ?
yeah .
they' re reorganizing the whole company .
you' re out , too .
i think you' re in .
l' m in what ?
your old job .
what ?
running the department ?
that' s the rumor .
the whole thing seems so arbitrary .
i feel used .
yeah .
kind of tough to know you' re replaceable , huh ?
i' m i' m sorry you lost your jobs .

yes .
i' m actually jogging outside .
# please # playa del rey .
don' t laugh .
# remember me #
l' m thinking about getting into ...
# happily #
# by the rose bush #
# laughing with roses on my chin #
# the time when # # we counted every black car #
# passing your house beneath the hill # # and up until # # someone caught us in the kitchen #
# with knives #
# a mountain range #
# a piggy bank #
# a vision to removed to mention #
# but , please , remember me # # fondly #
# i heard from someone you' re still pretty #
# and then #
# they went on to say #
# that the pearly gates # # are so eloquently repeated #
# like words i' ve lost and found #
# and don' t look down #
# and someone save temptation #
# and , please #
# remember me silently #
# ln the car behind the corner #
# you hold my hand #
# between your knees #
# you turn from me #
# said the trapeze , it was wonderful #
# but never meant to last #
# the clouds have passed #
# so we just come up with anger #
# and then #
# the circus moved #
# the parking lot #
# hiding out , a hint of danger #
# so , please , remember me # # fondly #
# you' re my uphill crawl , my dear #
# but if i make #
# the pearly gates #
# do my best to make a drawing of god #
# and lucifer #
# a boy and girl #
# an angel kissin ' on a silkscreen of mars #
# the aftermath #
# a marching band #
# all around the fray just trapeze swinging ##
