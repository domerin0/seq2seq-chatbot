this is the captain speaking .
we' re just now passing the arctic circle which means we' re in the land of the midnight sun .
please , sit still .
what about your suitcase ?
probably on its way to murmansk .
what is it like in the winter ?
the opposite , completely dark .
take it easy .
the light was red .
it was green .
yes , of course it was green .
my memory fails me .
ls everything all right ?
what about her clothes ?
she was naked .
nothing else ?
just a necklace and two earrings .
where are they ?
they' ve been checked .
you' il have a preliminary report tomorrow .
where are they ?
you came quickly .
what do you know about the case ?
she left a party in the middle of the night , saturday .
found at the garbage dump 30 hours later .
that' s all .
did she have a record ?
did you know her ?
no ...
but i saw her sometimes .
where ?
she lived in an apartment nearby .
let' s take a look .
we won' t find anything , tom .
he' s even washed her hair .
her hands and nails were scrubbed too .
perfectionist .
even the best makes mistakes .
how did you get here before us ?
vacation ...
i have family here .
the police in stockholm raided an apartment building .
they stormed in fully armed .
he sat up in bed and shouted ...
that' s when they recognized him .
the chief inspector ?
ln a very intimate conversation with the main witness .
take your time .
when did they meet ?
9 months ago .
right after she moved to town .
they were together all the time .
they had an argument that night .
does he have an alibi ?
not for late that night .
where did she get money ?
grants ...
her parents are dead .
dolce & gabbana !
at least 6000 kroners .
she didn' t need this .
maybe it was exactly what she needed .
what do you mean ?
boosts your self confidence .
you need that when you' re 17 .
at least i did .
don' t forget this .
we' il call a press conference when we have something to tell you .
he might have followed her from the party .
an argument lead to a fight .
he panicked .
this murder is no accident .
it' s been carried out with too much knowledge .
you might be right about that ...
what knowledge ?
the way all clues have been removed .
i' m glad you' re here .
i' m told you are good .
when did you last see her ...
eilert ?
it' s in the report .
yes , but i want you to tell me .
at the party .
can you move over a bit ?
these rooms are too small .
what did you do at the party ?
the usual .
drinking ...
dancing ...
partying .
your friends told us different .
what did they say ?
what do you think ?
i don' t know .
they' re not my friends .
oh ... why not ?
because they' re lying .
what ?
they' re lying !
why are they lying ?
were you tanja' s boyfriend ?
yes .
nice girl .
tanja left the party ...
... at a quarter past two .
did you follow her ?
no .
when did you leave then ?
i stayed on for a while , and then i went home .
did tanja like other men to look at her ?
listen ...
i don' t understand fuckin ' swedish .
me neither .
you got jealous .
you argued , and she ran off to someone else .
bullshit .
her clothes ...
do you know how much they cost ?
she couldn' t afford them ... and neither could you .
she saw someone else .
he gave her gifts .
maybe she needed his attention ?
you weren' t enough , eilert .
who did she go to ?
i don' t know .
come on .
let' s get this over with .
she went to some guy .
i don' t know who he is .
how do you know ?
i just found out .
how do you know ?
coffee ?
i' m so fed up with reviving dead people .
it' s what you make of it .
no , it isn' t .
you should' ve seen her clothes .
at least 60 dresses !
i once met a woman with 50 pairs of shoes .
what did she want them for ?
i have no idea .
let' s get this job done quickly , erik .
oh ... are we in a rush ?
i applied for a job in norway .
not north norway .
i' ve been here before .
i know .
you do ?
yes , you told me about it .
a post office robbery in the spring of 1972 .
please don' t knock on the counter .
cld .
and ... ?
engstrom and vik .
i thought maybe i' d done something wrong .
talk to him about that .
you must see a lot of weird things .
working for the police , i mean .
we see a lot of pretty things too .
don' t flirt with me .
i' m on duty .
so are we .
when you' ve been a policeman long enough , nothin' s weird .
your luggage arrived before you .
good .
i' ve nearly been here before .
it reminds me of a hotel on the west cost where we stay when we visit my in laws .
one morning we woke up with a couple standing in our room .
i tried to get rid of them but they insist that it' s their room .
eva got really upset .
yes .
they insist that it' s their room ... ?
room ?
what interests did she have ?
what dreams ?
who did she associate with ?
who did she want to associate with ?
which teachers did she like and dislike ?
which boys did she like ?
or maybe she didn' t like ?
everything is equally important .
it' s absurd that tanja is gone .
it' s hard to understand that she won' t be sitting here tomorrow .
or next week ...
some of you like tanja , and some of you hated her but none of you will ever see her again ...
because she is dead ... murdered .
what did she want ?
who ?
hagen .
what is it with you and hagen ?
nothing .
the body of a 17 year old ...
what did she want ?
they' ve found tanja' s backpack .
when did you find the bag ?
two hours ago .
outside an old shed near the dump .
some kids found it .
why isn' t tom here ?
he' s finished .
he' s already checked it for finger ...
where is he ?
on his way to the shed .
stop him .
find out who she went to the movies with .
astrid , maybe the staff remember something .
the moment .
jon holt ...
pia falls in love with thomas ,
but thinks he' s hiding something from her .
a voice inside pia' s head tells her
how to get rid of the problem .
anyone here read crime novels ?
yes .
nobody goes near the shed .
lf the perpetrator thinks the bag may reveal him , he' il come and get it .
it was the same school bag the murdered tanja lorentzen had with her when she left the party on sunday morning .
it' s not been found .
lf you see or find such a bag , then please contact the police .
it may contain clues which will lead us to tanja' s killer .
maybe he doesn' t watch tv .
oh , yes .
there' s nothing else to do around here .
am i upsetting you ?
you probably hear jokes like that all the time .
no .
he' s here .
wait till he picks up the bag , then we follow him .
quietly .
freeze !
police !
he went into the shed .
let' s get him .
you can' t get anywhere now .
please come out .
zakariassen !
down to the sea , and follow the waterline .
erik , you take the hillside , and when you reach the bay , you go left .
here ... here ... here ...
which way did he go ?
there ...
you said to the right ...
you said to the right .
then i found zakariassen laying between the stones and ...
he pointed .
i ran in the direction he pointed .
then i saw a figure disappear behind a stone ...
then i slipped .
i heard a shot , and saw him running towards me .
first he shoots vik , and then he runs straight towards you .
what ?
after he shot vik ...
did the perpetrator run straight towards you ?
i suppose he didn' t see me .
it was foggy .
and then ?
when he saw me , he turned abruptly and ran back .
i ran after him down towards the sea .
then he turned again .
shot at me missed and ran further .
that' s when i spotted erik and stopped to ... help him .
describe the man you saw .
it' s that fucking map' s fault !
every stone is marked on it , but not the bunker below the shed .
yes , most unfortunate .
lf i' d known about that tunnel , i' d had a man down there .
we should always be armed , like you do in sweden .
when will the autopsy take place ?
tomorrow .
the bullet' s in his spine .
the bullet is no good without the weapon .
don' t worry .
one of your detectives will handle the vik case .
we need a special permit to be armed , and there was no reason in this case as we couldn' t imagine ...
we heard you were the first to arrive at the crime scene .
what did you see ?
it was very foggy .
i was the first person to reach the beach , and found vik lying there .
there was nothing i could do .
how does it feel to lose a colleague like that ?
damn sad .
does it hurt ?
what ?
you' ve been on the tv all night .
did you work together for a long time ?
just over a year .
weird .
what ?
he was standing there yesterday .
i wish i' d been nicer to him .
don' t worry .
you could say anything to him .
he was ...
do you have masking tape ?
masking tape ?
masking tape .
how does it feel ?
well ...
like a horse kicked you ?
i thought you came to turn out the light .
thanks .
it was irresponsible .
what ?
to send you after him .
it was irresponsible .
the guy was armed .
how could we know ?
madman .
waving his arms around before he shot .
did you see him shoot vik ?
no , i didn' t see anything .
it can' t be easy .
he was a nice chap .
have they removed the bullet ?
it went straight through .
just a flesh wound .
good .
we need you .
he knew it might be a trap .
that' s why he was armed .
he' s cold , calculating and thinks he' s more intelligent than the police .
his arrogance will lead him to make a mistake .
tanja' s bag contains something that may convict the killer , or at least the killer thinks so .
we have to check its contents more thoroughly .
we have to confront tanja' s classmates with its contents and knock on all doors between the house of the party and the crime scene .
tom ... your preliminary conclusion .
tanja lorentzen died of a cerebral hemorrhage .
we assume that she didn' t die instantly .
no sexual assaults .
no sperm .
nothing .
he worked with erik for a long time .
i' il be handling the vik case .
good .
we' il just have to do our best .
of course .
we shall remember erik vik as a sociable and proud policeman with one minute' s silence .
something wrong ?
he was lying on his stomach .
not on his back .
was this where you found vik ?
yes .
okay .
mark the spot and take a photo .
we found this next to where zakariassen was .
good .
make sure tom runs a match with the bullet .
reminds me of a hotel where we stay when we visit my in laws ...
then one morning we woke up , and there' s a couple ...
do you have something to drink ?
something strong ?
cognac ?
watch the reception desk .
do you like whiskey ?
yes , sure .
cheers !
i' m not allowed to do this .
talk to strange men in the middle of the night ?
no .
we have to drink in silence ...
how about you ?
don' t you ever ask anybody for permission ?
not to drink with you .
don' t you have a family ?
no .
that' s a pity ...
it' s nice to be alone too .
do you have any sisters or brothers ?
no ...
i once had a brother , but he died when i was 11 .
i don' t know anybody who has a dead brother .
it' s not that strange .
i thought it was embarrassing .
when i came to school , the others didn' t know anything .
i didn' t say anything .
but they must have asked for him ?
yes , but i invented stories about where he was and what had happened to him .
as time went by the stories got more and more unlikely ...
i' d better go upstairs .
your colleague was here looking for you .
who ?
he didn' t introduce himself .
what did he look like ?
a bit older than you .
a bit rough ...
i never remember how people look .
just the impression they make .
what impression did he make ?
a bit nervous .
smiled all the time .
did he leave a message ?
he' d seen something .
he wanted to talk to you ...
ls it important ?
no , i don' t think so .
aren' t you going to finish your whiskey ?
another time .
froya ?
you' re froya selmer .
you' re the cop .
i have to talk to you .
can you come over here ?
you might' ve looked better in a uniform .
you went to that party .
i was wasted .
too wasted to remember what happened ?
nothing happened .
that' s why i got wasted .
was tanja just as " loaded " ?
" loaded " ?
drunk .
nobody understood anything you said .
pardon ?
ln the classroom .
but you understood ?
it' s not the first time i' ve met a swede .
was it tanja' s boyfriend you spoke to ?
why did you ask when you knew the answer ?
will you come for a ride ?
a ride with you ?
don' t you want to ?
may i smoke ?
no .
show me something cool !
something cool " ?
something cool .
i don' t know what' s cool any more .
let me out !
here you go ...
maybe you' d like me to accompany you ?
i think you know .
know what ?
where tanja got all her nice clothes .
how should i know ?
did she have a better friend than you ?
here , you see ...
this is where they found her ... in a garbage bag .
tanja had a relationship with an older man .
older than me .
he paid for her expensive clothes .
you told eilert about him .
he would' ve found out anyway .
but you told him ... at that party .
she didn' t have to go ...
it was her own fault .
what' s his name ?
the man she was with ?
i never spoke to him .
she was really weird about it .
like it was something special ... having an affair with him .
who ?
an old pig .
where did they meet ?
she wrote him a letter .
she had read one of his books .
was completely hooked .
what' s his name ?
the author .
jon holt .
that wasn' t hard was it ?
i' il take you home now .
yes ...
engstrom .
i don' t want any more visits .
jon holt ...
we have to meet .
no , not the two of us together .
i suppose you understand ?
why not ?
keep the police away from me , and you' il sleep much better .
there are two pages missing from the book .
they' ve been torn out .
what was written on those pages ?
i went to tanja' s apartment to check .
did you find the pages ?
i found another copy of the same book .
must be a damn good book then ?
what was written on the pages ?
a description of two young people infatuated with one another .
so tanja buys a new book because two pages are missing .
no .
the other book was signed
to tanja " with holt' s own signature .
well done , arne .
we' il have to ask the author if he remembers her .
engstrom ...
i need a word .
yes , of course .
did vik have any problems ?
problems ?
i just heard his memory failed him .
no , he was a very competent policeman .
i can' t understand your explanation at the reconstruction .
you said you were here when the perpetrator shot at you .
yes , exactly .
and that' s where you saw erik vik .
yes .
i have compared the photos with your statement .
it' s not possible to see erik vik in the water from the distance ...
not in heavy fog .
i might have been a few yards closer ...
you must have been 15 ...
we' re chasing a killer .
would you like to change your statement ?
you do it , if you want to .
hello ...
let me take you to the hospital .
where does bus 27 go ?
pardon ?
bus 27 .
follow it !
thanks for calling .
have we met ?
no ... but i' ve gotten to know someone you used to know .
i know very few .
thin , little girl ... with dark hair .
no , i don' t think so .
don' t pretend .
you were stupid enough to give her signed books .
my colleagues are looking for you .
oh , you mean the young girl at the hotel reception ...
she' s a blond , isn' t she ?
was it wise of you to come to the hotel ?
i needed some support .
but you' re never there during the night ... she said .
she has nothing to do with this .
no , but she' s very cute ...
likes you , and ...
i can tell these things straight away .
what' s her name again ?
i don' t know .
you could have asked .
you look good on tv .
it' s really strange ...
i' ve always had such deep respect for the police .
yet sometimes one has to alter the truth a bit .
an author understands that .
do you suffer from acrophobia ?
no .
i stood right behind you ...
i saw you .
saw you lift the gun and shoot your friend .
but the bullet we have is from your gun ...
you lost your gun .
there' s never been any weapons registered to me .
couldn' t you just have admitted it ?
a short suspension and back to work , everything as it used to be .
nobody is perfect .
you did nearly everything right .
enticed her out to a deserted place .
beat her to death .
cleaned up after yourself .
washed her ...
even washed her hair .
i' ve been doing those things for 20 years .
trying to imagine what happens afterwards ...
when you really cross the line .
what happens here .
the fiction became too boring ...
when you' ve put all the pieces together ... the account balances .
nothing is missing .
you have complete control .
complete control .
it' s all just mathematics ...
but it' s impossible to calculate such a thing .
you realize that afterwards , when you' ve been there yourself .
you know that ...
i know nothing of the sort .
what do you know about her boyfriend ?
who ?
her boyfriend .
eilert ...
what about him ?
we' il have to make up a story about him .
do you think it' s him ?
well , he met tanja several times .
i' m looking for froya selmer .
her parents don' t know where she is .
who ?
you know her , don' t you ?
what does she look like ?
you spoke to her yesterday .
what did she say ?
not much .
she was scared .
why didn' t you tell me ?
i' m telling you now .
that' s not good enough .
we have to cooperate .
i' m sorry ...
shall we go in ?
where were you on the night of may 28th ?
i' m always at home during the night .
that' s when i write .
were you alone ?
yes , i like to be alone at night .
it' s worse during the day .
no alibi ?
i' ve never needed an alibi .
how did you get to know tanja lorentzen ?
she appeared at my door .
strange girl .
she' d read one of my books .
was very engaged in the story .
she thought there was something wrong with my angle .
what was the book about ?
some youngsters who were very co dependent ...
she has fantasies about killing him to ...
to get rid of him ...
read it yourself .
i did .
what kind of relationship did you have ?
she thought it was exciting to meet an author .
did you have sex ?
she was about 15 .
did you have sex ?
no .
why not ?
why not ?
i was like a father to her .
she had a lot of problems .
what kind of problems ?
she didn' t want to talk about them .
so how do you know she had problems ?
she was always covered in bruises ...
on her arms ... on her neck .
everywhere .
did you ever ask her why ?
she fell down when she drank .
you think her boyfriend knocked her around ?
she had a lot of " bad luck " .
you saw her several times .
secret meetings .
became a father to her .
but when she' s murdered , you don' t even go to the police ...
come here ...
i' il show you something .
look here .
he can barely see you .
no ...
i suppose that' s just as well .
so he has something to look forward to , you mean ?
no , i think they' re disgusting .
they' re just a bit helpless .
where is their mother ?
she died .
don' t touch me !
i' m sorry ... sorry .
i just wanted to show you the kittens .
there is someone in the room .
i sit up in bed .
they insist it' s their room .
yes , they insist .
the guy threatens to throw me out .
i ask who the hell he thinks he is .
erik vik " he says .
what ?
erik vik , oslo " .
the reception mixed up the bookings .
hope you' il clean up .
that' s what we' re doing .
here !
that' s not mine !
let me go !
jonas ... is everything okay ?
i' m not sleeping well .
you' re sick .
you' ve already made it all up in your nasty mind .
you are so sick .
don' t make this worse .
we' ve found your weapon .
a bullet from it was found in our colleague' s chest .
what happened ?
how did you get the gun ?
i don' t have a gun , damn you .
do you want an attorney ?
i haven' t done anything ...
i didn' t do anything !
back to oslo' s underworld ?
no , i' m going home .
this was my last job in norway .
how can you take it ?
take what ?
two bodies in one week .
i' ve had it up to here .
it made me think of you seeing this year after year .
you get used to it .
you just have to avoid mixing your job and your personal life .
what the hell do you want ?
ls everything okay ?
of course .
i don' t know if i can trust you .
what do you mean ?
you' re not quite sane .
you don' t even sleep at night .
who told you ?
tanja .
she visits me at night .
doesn' t give in .
what else did she say ?
that you should be careful who you team up with .
i should have known that .
you should be very careful who you team up with .
tanja should have thought of that .
it was an accident .
she called me in the middle of the night .
she was wild .
her boyfriend had dumped her .
do you understand ? !
it was an accident .
don' t worry .
everything' s been taken care of .
she misunderstood .
i just wanted to comfort her .
but then i got so turned on .
she noticed .
only once , and that was too much .
calm down !
she didn' t bleed much .
she was just very tired .
i put her to bed .
afterwards i tried to wake her , but she just wanted to sleep .
she slept and slept and slept ...
calm down now !
that friend of yours ...
did he get too close to you ?
was that why you shot him ?
go away .
there' s nothing you can do .
get lost .
i know about a quiet place ... where i can write .
nice to see you again .
we were worried about you .
your parents didn' t know where you were .
have you come to tell us something ?
she' s going to drive me home .
somebody' s lying in this case .
froya tells me quite a different story about tanja .
like what ?
eilert never hit her .
froya ... when did you last see eilert ?
ls that so important ?
i' m just trying to clarify her relationship with eilert .
you' re in love with him , aren' t you ?
it was that writer .
he could get completely crazy .
relax .
just get into the car and i' il drive you home .
eilert wasn' t nasty .
he never was .
one more thing ...
the fingerprints on the actual gun were wiped clean but tom found one under the barrel that didn' t belong to eilert .
that just proves that someone else touched the gun .
i want holt' s fingerprints .
i' il get a search warrant .
i' ve already got one .
good .
drive froya home and i' il see you at holt' s apartment as soon as possible .
nobody here .
we' il find him .
i' il put out an apb on him .
take his toothbrush to start with .
you' il probably find his fingerprints on it .
get some sleep .
you look tired .
jon !
calm down .
i' ve just come to talk .
i know it was an accident .
she started to laugh ... she just laughed .
i never touched her .
you buy her dresses for 20, 000 kroners and take her to a shed to fuck her .
just once ...
just one single time .
she took my hand ...
she touched my neck , and then ... she touched me above my eyes .
she smelt so strange .
and she was very warm .
too warm .
didn' t you manage ?
i tried .
i don' t want to listen to that crap .
wait !
i' ve rarely come across a more calculated killer .
he planned every detail .
he even washed her hair .
it' s wrong .
holt' s no killer type .
it could' ve been an accident .
he did shoot vik .
panic .
i' m glad you' re the one who was called in .
i have to admit you really lived up to your reputation .
never gives up ...
not until the case is solved .
your spirit has been an inspiration for all of us .
engstrom ...
am i disturbing you ?
no , come in .
what a surprise .
i' ve come to give you something .
what ?
i went back to the crime scene .
found a cartridge case .
a norma .
that' s a swedish make .
the swedish police use them .
yes .
say what you have to say .
