i' m talkin ' about friendship .  i' m talkin ' about character .  i' m talkin ' about hell , leo , i ain' t embarrassed to use the word .
i' m talkin ' about ethics .
you know i' m a sportin ' man .
i like to lay the occasional bet .
but i ain' t that sportin ' .
when i fix a fight say i pay a three to one favorite ... to throw a goddamned fight .
i figure i got the right to expect that fight to go off at three to one .
but every time i lay in bed with this son of a bitch bernie bernbaum , before i know it , the odds is even up .
or worse , i' m bettin ' on the short money .
the sheeny knows i like sure things .
he' s sellin ' the information i fixed the fight .
out of town money comes pouring in .
the odds go straight to hell .
i don' t know who he' s sellin ' to maybe the los angeles combine .
i don' t know .
the point is ,  bernie ain' t satisfied with the honest dollar he can make off the vig .
he ain' t satisfied with the business i do on his book .
he is sellin ' tips on how i bet .
and that means part of the payoff that should be riding on my hip ... is riding on someone else' s .
so , back we go to these questions friendship , character , ethics .
so , it' s clear what i' m saying ?
as mud .
it' s gettin ' so a businessman can' t expect no return from a fixed fight .
now , if you can' t trust a fix , what can you trust ?
for a good return , you gotta go bettin ' on chance ,  and then you' re back with anarchy .  right back in the jungle .  that' s why ethics is important what separates us from the animals ,
the beasts of burden , the beasts of prey .
ethics .
where as , uh , bernie bernbaum is a horse of a different color , ethics wise , as in he ain' t got any .
you sure it' s bernie selling you out ?
it ain' t elves .
no one else knows about the fix ?
no one that ain' t got ethics .
what about the fighters you pay to tank out ?
we only pick fighters we know we can put the fear of god in .
any other bookies know ?
you play anyone else' s book ?
i i lay an occasional bet with mink larouie .
but it ain' t mink .
i' il vouch for that .
how do you know ?
it ain' t mink .
mink is eddie dane' s boy .
of course the dane always knows about the fix .
and what the hell is that supposed to mean ?
let it drift .
all it means is a lot of people know .
i guess you ain' t been listenin ' .
sure , other people know .
that' s why we gotta go to this question of character ... to determine just who , exactly , is chiselin ' in on my fix .
and that' s how we know that it' s bernie bernbaum , the shmatte kid
' cause ethically , he' s kinda shaky .
so you want to kill him .
for starters .
sorry , caspar .
bernie pays for protection .
listen , leo , i ain' t askin ' you for permission .
i' m tellin ' you as a courtesy .
i need to do this thing , so it' s gonna get done .
and i' m tellin ' you , as a courtesy , you' il have trouble .
you came here to see if i' d kick if you killed bernie .
well , there' s your answer .
i pay off to you every month like a greengrocer a lot more than the shmatte , and i' m sick of gettin ' the high hat .
you pay off for protection just like everyone else .
as far as i know , and what i don' t know in this town ain' t worth knowing , the cops haven' t closed any of your dives ... and the d. a. hasn' t touched any of your rackets .
you haven' t bought any license to kill bookies ,  and today i ain' t sellin ' any .
so take your funky and dangle .
you think i' m some guinea fresh off the boat , and you can kick me .
but i' m too big for that now .
i' m sick of takin ' the strap from you , leo .
i' m sick of marching into this goddamn office ... to kiss your irish ass , and i' m sick of the high hat !
you' s fancy pants , all of youse .
johnny ?
you' re exactly as big as i let you be and no bigger , and don' t forget it , ever .
that' s right , leo .
you' re the big shot around here , and i' m just some schnook likes to get slapped around .
twist a pig' s ear , watch him squeal .
bad play , leo .
who got up the wrong side , huh ?
same side as always .  that' s what i mean .
still owe money to
who is your bookie , lazarre ?
i could put it right for you .
thanks , leo .
i don' t need it .
in a pig' s eye .
you haven' t played a winner in six weeks .
people will speak ill of me if i let him break your legs .
people will say i had it coming .
and they' il be right , but that ain' t the point .
call me a bighearted slob , but i' m gonna square it for you , yeah .
i think i' il do that this very same night .
lookin ' at you mopin ' around takes away all my
what do you call it ?
joy de veever " ?
joie de vivre .  well , if you' re gonna laugh at me , the hell with ya .
the hell with you .
i' il square myself with lazarre , if you don' t mind .
that' s why god invented cards .
there is one thing you can do for me .
name it .
think about what protecting bernie gets us .
think about what offending caspar loses us .
oh , come on , tommy .
you know i don' t like to think .
yeah .
well , think about whether you should start .
wake up , tommy .
i am awake .
your eyes are shut .
who you gonna believe ?
how' d i do ?
what do you think ?
you are a millionaire .
you gonna remember your friends ?
where' s me hat ?
you bet it , mug .
good thing the game broke up before you bet your trousers .
who made off with me hat ?
verna .
verna and mink .
who ?  mink and verna .
is thunderclap running tonight ?
thunderclap ?
yeah .
what' s she leaving at ?
three to one , more than likely .
lay off , tom .
you shouldn' t go deeper in the hole .
tell lazarre ... i want 500 on the nose .
you would have it .
i want me hat .
is that all you came for ?
yeah .
i want me hat .
it' s mine .
i won it .
what are you gonna do with it ?
drop dead .
i need a drink .
why didn' t you say so ?
hello , tommy .
sorry about the hour .
i' il live .
what' s the rumpus ?
can i come in ?
sure .
drink ?
i wouldn' t mind .
i tried callin ' earlier .
i got home late .
well , uh , i' m sorry about the hour .
uh huh .
not bad .
better than the paint we sell at the club .
that it is .
that it is .
you thought about cutting bernie loose ?
can' t do it , tommy .
can' t do it .
that' s sort of why i' m , uh
tommy , i don' t know where verna is .
uh huh .
i know what you re thinkin ' , what else is new ?
but the situation now i' m worried .
verna can take care of herself , maybe better than you can .
what does that mean ?
want another one ?
no .
what does that mean ?
how far she got her hooks into you ?
that' s a hell of a question .
it' s a grift .
if she didn' t need you to protect her brother from johnny caspar , you think she' d still be going on slow carriage rides with you through the park ?
that' s the deal , isn t it ?
you keep bernie under wraps till caspar cools down ?
jesus , you' re a prickly pear .
what' s wrong with her wanting her brother taken care of ?
nothing .
i don' t blame her .
she sees the angle , which is you , she plays it .
she' s a grifter , just like her brother .
probably had grifter parents and grifter grandparents ... and someday they' re each gonna spawn little grifter kids .
stop it , tommy .
i don' t like to hear my friends run down , even by other friends .
friendship' s got nothing to do with it .
the hell you say .
you' d do anything to help your friends , like you' d do anything to kick your enemies .
wrong , leo .
you do things for a reason .
okay , tom .
you know all the angles , christ , better than anybody .
but may be you' re wrong about this .
you don' t know what' s in verna' s heart .
leo , if she' s such an angel , why are you looking for her at 4 : 00 in the morning ?
i put a tail on her this afternoon .
uh huh .
i asked rug daniels to follow her around , just , you know , to keep her out of trouble .
i was worried .
after that meeting with caspar , you can' t be too careful .
so what did rug say that has you scurrying over here ?
that' s just it .
nothing .
he' s disappeared .
so you lost your lady friend and the tail you put on her ?
i guess it does sound pretty sorry at that .
help me out , tom .
i wouldn' t know where to start lookin ' .
you know rug' s crowd .
you know the people verna runs with .
it' s just i' m worried now with things the way they are between me and caspar .
you shouldn' t be confronting johnny caspar .
that' s what i' ve been trying to tell you .
you can' t trade body blows with him .
he' s gotten too strong .
i reckon i can still trade body blows with any man in this town .
except you , tom .
and verna .
okay .
give me the needle .
i am a sap .
i deserve it .
thanks for the drink .
let me know if you hear anything .
who was that ?
leo .
he' s lookin ' for you .
did you tell him i was here ?
no .
did you put in a good word for my brother ?
no .
you said you would .
i said i' d think about it .
what did you tell him ?
did you see rug daniels last night ?
no .
what did you tell leo ?
i told him you were a tramp and he should dump you .
you' re a son of a bitch , tom .
hello , tom .
what' s the rumpus ?
mink .
i see you got your hat back .
yeah , what of it ?
not a thing .
look , if it ain' t my business , i got not a thing to say .
listen , bernie wants to see you .
it' s important .
yeah , well , i' m right here .
i' m not made of glass .
he' s nervous walkin ' around in public .
he' s a right guy , but he' s very nervous .
i mean , who wouldn' t be ?
in the spot he' s in , who wouldn' t be ?
he asked me to ask you to ask leo to take care of him .
leo listens to you .
not that leo wouldn' t help a shmatte anyway .
a guy like bernie ?
a straight shooter like him ?
i don' t get it , mink .
what' s to get ?
it' s as plain as the nose on your face .
i thought you were eddie dane' s sycophant .
yeah , tom , that' s right , but a guy can have more than one friend , can' t he ?
not that i want the dane to know about it , but the shmatte , he' s a right guy , tommy .
he' s got a mixed reputation , but for a sheeny , he' s got a lot of good qualities .
what' s goin ' on between you and bernie ?
nothin ' , tom .
we re just ... friends , you know , amigos .
you' re a fickle boy , mink .
if eddie dane finds out that you got another " amigo "
well , i don' t peg him for the understanding type .
find out ?
how' s he gonna find out ?
damn it , you and me ain' t even been talkin ' !
jesus , tom !
damn it !
jesus !
hello , tommy .
you know o' doole and the mayor ?
i oughta .
voted for him six times last may .
and that ain' t the record , either .
oh , verna turned up .
she' s downstairs .
she say where she' d been ?
no .
i didn t want to press her .
you hear about rug ?
yeah .
r. i. p.
they took his hair , tommy .
jesus , that' s strange .
why would they do that ?
maybe it was injuns .  eye ties , more like it .
giovanni gasparo .
so you figure caspar bumped rug .
well , it' s pretty obvious , ain' t it ?
yeah ?
so what' s the plan ?
well , we' il jump on the guinea hard with both feet .
give him the low down , dale .
yes .
well , um ,
leo here just reminded us that mr. caspar operates ... several clubs in our city , wherein the patrons imbibe of rum and play at games of chance .
and we' re supposed to stop the party .
they don' t look to happy about it , leo .
oh , no , it ain' t that , tom .
jesus , tom , we do as we' re told .
maybe they' re right not to like it .
stirring up this hornet' s nest won' t be good for anyone , and it' il mean killing .
i' m not thrilled about it either , but i can' t just lay down to caspar .
you could do worse .
you might not like it , but giving up bernie bernbaum ... is a pretty small price to pay for peace .
business is business , and a war is going to hurt everybody .
bernie plays with fire , he s got to deal with the consequences . even if that means he gets bumped off .
sweet jesus , tom , that ain' t even the point anymore .
caspar pooped rug .
the day i back down from a fight , caspar' s welcome to the rackets , this town and my place at the table .
i didn' t start this thing , but  you did start it .
you and verna .
we can dangle , leo , if you d prefer .
sit down , dale !
we' re all friends here .
and caspar hasn' t broken the rules , bernie has , and you , too , by helping him .
and if that isn' t enough , consider that if you make this a war , you have more to lose than caspar .
okay , but more to beat him with .
jesus , tom , the two of us have faced worse odds .
never without reason .
it helps to have one .
well , it' s your call .
my opinion used to count for something around here .
but it' s always yours to take or leave .
come on , tommy .
it' s not like that .
goddamn it !
goddamn kid' s just like a twist .
get me a stiff one .
no small talk , huh ?
they shoot your horse ?
if there' s any justice .
verna around ?
she stepped into the ladies ' room .
you got lazarre' s 500 ?
you' il have to carry me for a few days .
he ain' t gonna like that .
couldn' t you get it from leo ?
it' s not leo' s debt .
i' il pay me own way .
i admire a man of principle .
does this go on the tab ?
close your eyes , ladies .
i' m coming through .
who' s the war paint for ?
go home and dry out .
you don' t need it for leo , believe me .
he already thinks you' re the original miss jesus .
what the hell' s the matter with you ?
what' s the matter with you ?
afraid people might get the right idea ?
leo' s got the right idea .
i like him .
he' s honest and he' s got a heart .
then it' s true what they say opposites attract .
do me a favor .
mind your own business .
this is my business .
intimidating helpless women is part of what i do .
then find one and intimidate her .
leo' s upstairs ... getting ready to shoot himself in the foot on your account .
i don' t know what you re talkin ' about .
he' s gonna go to the mat ... for your brother , and it' s gonna hurt him .
i don' t know leo' s business , but he' s a big boy .
he used to be .
look , what do you want , tom ?
you want me to pretend i don' t care what happens to bernie ?
well , i do .
he' s my brother .
i don' t want to see him get hurt .
if leo wants to help out , i il step out with him , show him a good time in return .
there' s no harm in that .
there' s a name for that kind of business arrangement .
look , i' il do what i have to do to protect bernie .
there' s no reason for you to try and queer that .
regardless of what you think about me , bernie' s a decent guy .
a straight shooter , huh ?
a square " g.
yeah .
sneer at him like everyone else , just because he' s different .
people think he' s a degenerate .
people think he' s scum .
well , he' s not .
poor misunderstood bernie .
what is this about , tom ?
you want me to stop seeing leo ?
why don' t you just say so ?
i want you to quit spinning leo in circles and pointing him where to go .
i forgot .
that' s your job .
i' il do what i have to do to protect leo .
i' m asking you politely .
leave him alone .
i don' t have to ask .
if i told him about our little dance last night , your pool would pretty soon dry up .
so would yours .
i don' t like being threatened .
i don' t like being taken for a sucker .
that might work with leo , but it don' t work with me .
do you think last night was just more campaigning for my brother ?
i can see the angles .
you know , if there was a market for little old ladies , you' d have grandma bernbaum first in line .
you' re a pathetic rum head .
and i love you , angel .
i suppose you think you raised hell .
sister , when i' ve raised hell , you' il know it .
yeah .
lazarre wants his money .
he wants it now .
i need a couple of days .
yeah ?
how come is that ?
because i don' t have it .
all right , welsher , how do i know you ain' t got it ?
because i say so .
that ain' t gonna be good enough .
what would be good enough ?
lazarre ain' t gonna like it one bit .
tell lazarre if he s not happy , he can send someone over to break my legs .
i won' t squawk .
hello , bernie .
hello , tom .
what' s the rumpus ?
come on in .
make your self at home .
yeah , you weren' t here , so i thought i' d do that .
i didn' t want to answer the phone , though .
i figured ... it wasn' t for me .
i get it .
get to the point , huh ?
okay .
the point is , i' m a good guy .
i' ve heard that from a lot of people today .
good guy , lots of friends .
that' s the way it works .
maybe if you appreciated me a little more , you wouldn' t be making waves with leo .
it' s a bad time to be doing that .
right now , we' re both in a jam .
i hear you re on a bad streak .
short of funds .
well , i got that crazy dago mad at me .
don' t ask me why .
i' m just a small timer ... trying to get by like everyone else .
i need help from my friends like leo and you .
leo gets your sister .
what are you sellin ' me ?
come on , tom .
it' s not like that at all .
it wasn' t my idea .
she' il sleep with anyone .
you know that .
she even tried to teach me a thing or two about bed artistry .
can you believe that ?
my own sister .
some crackpot idea about saving me from my friends .
she' s a sick twist , all right .
she speaks highly of you .
yeah , well , you stick by your family .
the point is , i can help you with your debts if that would make us friends .
my motto is , a guy can' t have too many .
big payday saturday , tom .
you could be in on it .
another fix ?
which fight ?
that' s confidential at the moment .
but it doesn' t have to stay that way .
how come you know so much about it ?
caspar isn' t laying any more bets with you .
you really must have mink jumping through hoops .
like i say , you can' t have too many .
we got a deal ?
i' il think about it .
i wouldn' t want it any other way .
hey , adolph .
my credit still good with you ?
mmm .
give me a hundred across on tailor made in the third tonight .
lazarre won' t like it .
try 50 across .
i' il try .
it' s another 1 50 you' il owe him .
only if i lose , adolph .
tommy , the way you re goin '
hey , horses got knees ?
i don' t know .
fetlocks .
well , if i was a horse , i' d be down on my fetlocks praying you don' t bet on me .
drift , small guy .
drop dead , ape .
come on , tom .
boss wants to see ya .
he didn' t have time to engrave nothin ' formal .
what you mean , he' s eatin ' too much ?
what' s the goddamn doctor know ?
what you eat for lunch ?
a hot dog .
just a hot dog ?
a hot dog and mustard .
a hot dog and mustard .
a hot dog and mustard !
you hear that , dane ?
my kid is as smart as a whip .
even uncle eddie thinks that' s funny .
okay .
go ahead .
which hand is the penny in ?
choose again .
okay .
here you go .
take the penny .
shiny new penny .
take the kid , wait in the car .
give him a penny , boys !
i ain' t got a penny , boss .
that' s a penny you owe him .
hello , tom .
what' s the rumpus ?
you like kids ?
no .
have a seat .
go ahead .
well , you' re missin ' out on a complete life .
i know , kids , big deal .
still , i' m telling you .
anyways , thanks for comin ' by .
i just wrote this check out to your bookmaker lazarre .
it' s for an even 1 , 500 , which is more than i hear you owe him , but i figured you could always use some money on the cuff , a high roller such as yourself .
what do you say ?
thanks .
always they apper , huh ?
well , you' re welcome .
you wanna know why i' m puttin ' you square with lazarre ?
not particularly .
i want everybody to be friends .
i do this , you' re friends with lazarre , he' s friends with you , you' re friends with me .
all you gotta do to show you re a friend is give me bernie bernbaum .
you know it' s the right thing anyway .
the shmatte steals from me .
i can' t have leo giving him a shiny new penny .
so the deal is , i give you bernie , smooth it over with leo and you bail me out with lazarre .
yeah .
then we re all friends again .
you , me , leo , the dane .
we can maybe have tea sometime .
come on , eddie .
friends is a mental state .
what do you say , kid ?
i' il think about it .
you' il think about it .
you hear that , dane ?
the kid' s a thinker .
that' s terrific .
does he want a pillow for his head ?
okay , kid .
think about it .
it' s a mental state .
if it' il help you think , you should know that if you don' t do this thing , you' re not gonna be in any shape to walk out of here .
would that be physically , or just a mental state ?
that ain' t friendly , kid .
i make you a nice offer , you give me the high hat .
hold it .
jesus , tom .
just in the nick of time , huh ?
well , no harm done .
unless your friend broke his foot .
where am i ?
where are you ?
johnny caspar' s pleasure dome .
same as when you left us about ten seconds ago .
hello , tom .
how are ya ?
care to scrape a knuckle on your playmate here ?
no .
thanks though , andy .
well , if you change your mind , we' il be interrogating for a while .
what was that party about , anyway ?
we do this every weekend .
jesus , what is the matter with you people ?
well , they said make it hurt , so we make it hurt .
drink , o' doole ?
i' m on duty .
to volstead .
any news about rug ?
still dead , far as i know .
get a slug out of him ?
yeah , . 22 .
listen , tom , i' m just the chief around here , so don' t bother tellin ' me if you don' t happen to feel like it , but what the hell is leo doin ' ?
make him listen to you , tom .
it ain' t right , all this fuss over one sheeny .
let caspar have bernie .
what' s one hebrew more or less ?
we' re burnin ' our meal ticket here .
leo will do what suits him , and you' il do what he tells you .
last i heard , leo was still running this town .
yeah , well , he won' t be for long if this keeps up .
it' s no good for anyone .
you said as much yourself .
first off , o' doole , i can say what i please to leo and about him .
you can t .
second , once leo decides , that' s that .
if that sticks going down , there are plenty of coppers i know ... who wouldn' t mind bein ' chief and could swallow it clean .
jesus , tom , i was just speculatin ' about a hypothesis .
i know i don' t know nothin ' .
it s just a just a damn mess , is all .
hello , officer .
i d like to report an intruder ... at 346 west lewis
who' s this ?
hello , shad .
tom reagan here .
you need the booze ?
no , we won' t be needing any today .
false alarm , huh ?
yeah .
my mother .
she didn' t recognize me .
let me talk to mulveany .
miss me ?
drop dead .
mulveany here .
sean ?
tell o' doole to get a car over to leo' s tonight .
if we re banging away at caspar , we oughta be ready for him to bang back .
what do you want ?
i was in the neighborhood , feeling a bit daffy , so i thought i' d drop in for an aperitif .
rug daniels is dead .
gee , that' s tough .
don' t get hysterical .
i' ve had enough excitement for one night without a dame going all weepy on me .
i barely knew the gentleman .
rug ?
a bit of a shakedown artist , not above the occasional grift .
bet you d understand that .
all in all , not a bad guy , if looks , brains and personality don' t count .
you better hope they don' t .
yeah , well
we' re none of us the saint i hear your brother is .
who killed him ?
leo thinks caspar did .
but you know better .
i do now .
you see , caspar just tried to buy me into fixing his tiff with leo , which he' d hardly do if he was waging war .
so i figure you killed him , angel .
you or st. bernard .
why would i or my brother kill rug daniels or anybody else ?
rug was following you .
he knew about you and me , and that wouldn' t help your play with leo , would it ?
you think i murdered someone ?
come on , tom .
you know me a little .
nobody knows anybody .
not that well .
you know , or you wouldn' t be here .
not at all , sugar .
i came to hear your side of the story .
how horrible rug was , how he goaded you into it , how he tried to shake you down .
that' s not why you came either .
tell me why i came .
the oldest reason there is .
there are friendlier places to drink .
why can' t you admit it ?
admit what ?
that you don' t like me seeing leo ' cause you' re jealous .
admit that you' ve got a heart , even though it may be small and feeble ... and you can' t remember the last time you used it .
if i d known we were gonna cast our feelings into words ,
i' d have memorized the song of solomon .
maybe that' s why i like you , tom .
i never knew anybody that made being a son of a bitch ... such a point of pride .
though one day you il pay the price for it .
okay , verna .
but until then , let' s get stinko .
let' s do something else first .
yeah .
let' s do plenty .
** oh , danny boy **
** the pipes , the pipes are calling **
** from glen to glen **
** and down the mountainside **
** the summer' s gone **

who' s winning ?

last night , four to one .
dana cudahy went up with the house .
and theirs ?
one burned .
the other three ?
lead .

leo' s .
the old man' s still an artist with a thompson .
yeah , do that .
well , find him , god damn it !
go and see if he fell in the john .
son of a bitch .
no chief .
who' s mindin ' the goddamn store ?
can t raise o' doole ?
no , nor the mayor either .
that' s not good .
they' re running .
they wouldn t dare !
i don' t know , leo .
i warned you not to hit caspar' s club .
i' m still here , ain' t i ?
caspar' s play hurt you anyway .
that sorry son of a bitch just slit his own throat .
listen to me , leo .
last night made you look vulnerable .
you don' t hold elected office in this town .
you run it because people think you run it .
once they stop thinking it , you stop running it .
jesus , tom .
it sounds like a bad break for me i wasn' t killed !
i mean it , leo .
start taking caspar seriously .
i know , i know .
retreat to win , give up bernie .
that' il solve all our problems .
won t anymore , i' il grant you that .
but going toe to toe with a psychopath will get you no where .
it' il force people to choose sides just when you' re looking shaky .
the hell i do !
then where' s the mayor ?
why aren' t there any police here ?
why weren' t there any police at your place last night ?
i didn' t ask for any .
i did .
mother hen , huh ?
what' s the matter , tommy ?
don t you think i can take care of myself ?
i know you can' t .
here' s the smart play , leo .
you lay back , you give bernie up , you let caspar think he' s made his point .
then you wait for him to show a weakness .
please , tom .
you' re sticking on bernie .
you' re sticking your neck out ... for a guy who' d chop you off at the heels if there was two bits in it .
tom , things aren' t as , uh , clear cut as you make it .
bernie' s well , hell , you know about me and verna .
things now are , uh
not that i haven' t been a gentleman , but
i plan to ask her to marry me , tom .
i guess you think that' s a bonehead play .
you think she wants you to ?
how the hell do i know ?
i think she does .
yeah , of course she does .
i know you think different , but , well , we just , uh
we just differ on that .
leo , caspar didn' t kill rug .
course he did .
no .
think about it just this one time .
who was rug following ?
huh ?
it needn' t have been that sinister .
strange man follows her down a dark alleyway .
i told you she can look after herself .
verna wouldn t panic , shoot someone just because he was following her .
nah , it wouldn' t have happened like that , and if it had she would have told me .
they pulled a . 22 slug out of him .
a pop gun , leo , a woman' s gun .
i know you don' t like her , tom , but i trust verna as much as i trust you .
okay , leo .
maybe it wasn' t that innocent .
maybe rug knew something she didn' t like him knowing and wouldn' t want you to know .
rug was following her .
maybe he knew where she was sleeping , and who with .
maybes don' t make it so .
there' s more than maybes .
you' ve trusted me before , you' ve never lost anything by it .
trust me on this .
this is too important .
i don' t ask much , and i don' t ask often .
trust me on this .
tommy .
trust me on this , or to hell with you .
you don' t mean that .
she was with me ... the night rug was following her , the night you dropped by .
oh .
**** [ irish tenor , indistinct ]
okay , leo .
okay .
i' il throw him out .
yeah , do that .
it' s the kiss off .
if i never see him again , it' il be soon enough .
hello ?
hello , frankie .
it' s tom .
how' s the funky business ?
i' ve had worse .
your ventilator mending ?
tell caspar it' s forgotten .
i' d like to see him .
ah .
all right , let me know .
it worked , whatever you did .
leo says we' re quits .
but you know i didn' t have anything to do with rug .
maybe not .
anyway , that isn' t what soured him on you .
oh , you and me , huh ?
you always take the long way around to get what you want , don t you , tom ?
you could have just asked .
what did i want ?
me .
yeah ?
yeah , yeah .
when ?
okay .
you still up ?
yeah .
what are you chewin ' over ?
dream i had once .
i was walking in the woods .
i don' t know why .
wind came whippin ' .
blew me hat off .
and you chased it , right ?
you ran and ran .
you finally caught up to it .
and you picked it up , but it wasn' t a hat anymore .
it had changed into something else , something wonderful .
no , it stayed a hat .
and no , i didn' t chase it .
nothing more foolish than a man chasin ' his hat .
where are you going ?
just have to do a few things .
you and leo might still be able to patch things up .
me and leo are finished .
nothing' s gonna change that .
you never know .
he' s got a big heart .
we' re quits as far as i' m concerned , never mind him .
and if leo did want me back , he' s an even bigger sap than i thought .
then why don' t we just pick up and leave town ?
there' s nothing keeping you here .
i know there' s nothing keeping me .
what about bernie ?
he could go with us .
you , me and bernie ?
where would we go , verna ?
niagara falls ?
why do you hate him ?
i don' t hate anyone .
or like any one .
where is bernie ?
why ?
leo can' t protect him anymore .
i oughta tell him to skip .
the royale , room 302 .
i guess we both double crossed leo , huh ?
there' s no gettin ' around that .
i guess he' s well rid of both of us .
the two of us , we' re about bad enough to deserve each other .
are we ?
we' re a couple of heels , tom .
yes , we are .
so he says , screw him .
give him a dollar .
this was my idea .
hello , tom .
uh , you know o' doole and the mayor .
hello , boys .
tom' s a big booster .
always has been .
that' s fine , that' s fine .
well , tom and i got the proverbial fat to chew .
just let us know if you need anything .
yeah .
happy days .
have a seat , kid .
yeah , that' s it .
so , you had enough time to think about things ?
yeah , well , uh , circumstances have changed .
don' t i know it .
last night i know the dane was disappointed the bulls showed up ... before frankie and tic tac really pinned your ears back , but i said , relax , eddie .
i got a feeling about this kid .
the kid and leo are gonna go bust o .
matter of time .
i said , the kid is too smart for leo . that' s what i said .
like a psychic .
ask the dane if i did .
like a goddamn psychic .
go ahead , ask him .
you vouch for that psychic business ?
that' s right , smart guy .
i know you knew ... protecting the shmatte was a dumb idea .
i know you' ve been wise to all of leo' s dumb ideas lately .
only a matter of time bust o .
that' s why last night we didn t put the arm on you , only leo .
seeing how you squiffed your play on leo , i can only be so grateful .
oh , that' s real brave coming from little miss punching bag .
okay , eddie .
friends now , huh ?
nuts .
so , i guess you' il be looking for a job , eh , kid ?
i might be .
you got references ?
you been to college ?
we only take eggs what' s been to college .
ain' t that right , dane ?
i' m joking , of course .
we all know you could be useful to us , a smart kid such as yourself .
the man who walks behind the man , who whispers in his ear .
i guess you could be useful in spades .
yeah , i can do plenty for you .
can you get leo off me ?
i' m tellin ' you not to worry about leo .
we got plans for him .
oh , yeah ?
like what ?
not so fast there , kaputnik .
i i think what the dane is trying to say is , there' il be time to talk about that .
we can table that for a later date .
see , last time we jawed , you gave me the high hat .
i guess i' m sayin ' ... you gotta put something on the table first .
ante up .
fair enough .
where do we start ?
hear that , dane ?
all business .
i told you he was a good kid . where do we start ? all business .
well , we can start , for instance , with the shmatte .
like , where' s the shmatte ?
you could may be tell us that .
the royale , room 302 .
and you might find mink with him .
the hell you say .
sure .
bernie and mink are cozy as lice .
and it ain' t just business .
this guy is lying .
why would i ?
this guy is wrong .
this guy is all wrong .
mink is clean and this clown is a smart guy .
it' s easy enough to find out , ain' t it ?
you find mink , you bring him back here .
go to the car .
i' m gonna send frankie and tic tac with you to the royale .
if bernie s there ,
frankie and tic tac' il take care of him .
and if he s not there ?
i' il sit facing the corner in a funny hat .

it' s my nature , tom .
i can' t help it .

i' m just a grifter .

god bless you .

anyone sees you , you really are dead .
you' re not my problem anymore .
of course not .
you' ve done your share .
thank you .
don' t worry .
i understand .
shut up .
shut up .
thank you .

god bless you .
put one in his brain ?
yeah .
atta boy .
mink ?
tom reagan .
where you been ?
will you look ?
eddie dane' s been looking for you .
bernie' s dead .
jesus christ !
stop wailing and listen to me .
caspar knows you were in on selling out his fix .
who the hell gave him that idea ?
heh !
i guess i gave him that idea .
sorry .
it just slipped out .
what are you trying to do ?
shut up and let me talk .
you lay low till caspar cools off .
then tell him the dane was in on the sellout , and i' il make caspar go easy on you .
you got me into this mess .
that' s right , i got you into this .
just remember , mink , i' m the only one who can get you out .
wait a minute , tom .
waah !
uuh !
hello , terry .
getting out the vote ?
a message from leo .
leo says if you re smart you' il sit this one out , not that he cares one way or the other .
leo says if you re on the wrong side you take your chances like anybody else .
leo says he gives no special favors , that' s all .
tell leo he' s not god on the throne .
he s just a cheap political boss with more hair tonic than brains .
uhh !
did leo say that as well ?
no , i said that .
cross leo , next time i' il say plenty .
when you re right , you' re right .
but you never say , i told you so .
so what am i right about ?
well , i' il tell you .
but first you gotta promise not to say i told you so .
i never say that , and i don' t like people who do .
mink was robbing me right along with the shmatte .
what convinced you of that ?
mink took a powder .
we can' t find him .
the dane , he s making excuses for him .
but personally , i think you was right .
i think that mink and bernie was in it together .
i think mink heard that you bumped the shmatte and lit out .
lousy son of a bitch .
i told you so .
what ?
you got a lip on you .
that' s all right .
i don' t generally care for it , but that' s all right .
you was a good sport to bump the shmatte .
how do you know mink skipped ?
because the dane can' t find him .
so he says .
meaning what exactly ?
maybe nothing .
i didn' t give it much thought , ' cause a guy' il say anything when his number is up .
but , uh, just before i bumped bernie , he swore tome that eddie dane and mink were setting him up that they were the ones who sold out your fix .
well , uh
well , like you say , uh , a guy' il say anything .
so why isn' t eddie dane here ?
well , he don' t care for you , kid .
maybe it' s only fair to tell you .
after you left us , he tried to sell me on a double cross .
he says tome , why don' t we double cross you and give you the bump ... after we get the shmatte .
well , i figure a deal' s a deal .
you' re square with me .
you bump the shmatte , i hold up my end .
it' s a question of ethics .
everything above board so everybody knows who' s a friend , who s an enemy .
so the dane doesn' t like you , but he wouldn' t cross me .
we go back .
of course there' s always that wild card when , uh , love is involved .
i know mink is eddie dane' s boy .
still , i i don' t make it that way .
then there' s nothing to worry about .
yeah .
papa , papa , i got a prize from the sister !
papa , papa , i got a prize from the sister !
papa , papa , i got a prize from the sister !
yeah .
just a minute .
of course , then , there' s no reason shut up !
papa , papa , i got
you take a page out of this guy' s book .
a little less you talk , a little more you think !
kids .
you gotta be firm .
anyways , there' s no reason not to check things out .
if mink is around , i want you to find him .
he can tell us what' s what .
what' s the matter ?
somebody hit you ?
what' s the matter ?
aren' t we friends anymore ?
if you find him , i wanna talk to him alone .
that' s the way you get the straight dope man to man .
just me , mink ... and my friend roscoe .
you understand what i' m saying ?
it ain' t complicated .
you should leave town for a few days .
things are gonna heat up around here .
go to the palisades .
i' il join you soon as i' m done .
i can' t find bernie .
did you find him ?
yeah .
is he leaving ?
he , uh he left .
he say where to ?
he didn' t say .
you  thanks .
what' s that potato eater up to ?
beats me .
that' s bernie' s sister , ain' t it ?
beats me .
what' s he seeing her for ?
beats me .
maybe
shut up .
get lost .
i' il see where the twist fops .
you know who i am ?
yeah , johnny caspar' s shadow .
what , did he stay in bed today ?
jesus .
i open my mouth , the whole world turns smart .
you' re leo' s twist , right ?
me and leo are through .
yeah ?
so you re sluttin ' around with tom now , huh ?
you get outta here .
okay .
see you later .
before i go , what' s your boyfriend up to ?
nothing i know about .
yeah ?
that doesn' t figure for me you dumpin ' leo for the guy who put a bullet in your brother .
he didn' t tell you .
aww .
spin her , eddie .
ooh !
you leo' s ?
yeah .
he wanted her looked out for .
well , you did a bang up job .
i' il be sure to tell him .
where' s leo ?
if i tell you , how do i know you won' t kill me ?
because if you told me and i killed you and you were lying , i wouldn' t get to kill you then .
where' s leo ?
he' s moving around .
he' s getting his mob together tomorrow at whiskey nick' s .
you sure ?
check it .
it' s gold .
you know what , yegg ?
i believe you .
go ahead and run , sweetie .
i' il track down all of you whores .
hello , bernie .
come on in .
make your self at home .
hello , tom .
i thought i' d do that , since you didn' t seem to be in .
figured it was a bad idea to wait in the hall , seeing as i' m supposed to be dead .
how' d you know it was me ?
you' re the only one i know who' d knock and then break in .
your other friends wouldn' t break in ?
my other friends want to kill me , so they wouldn' t knock .
what' s on your mind .
bernie ?
things .
i guess you must be angry .
i' m supposed to be gone far away .
i guess it seems sort of irresponsible , my being here .
and i was gonna leave .
honest , i was .
but then i started thinking ... if i stuck around , that would not be good for you .
then i started thinking that that might not be bad for me .
you didn' t see the play you gave me .
i mean , what am i gonna do ?
if i leave , i got nothing .
no money , no friends , nothing .
if i stay , i got you .
anyone finds out i' m alive , you' re dead , so ...
i got i got you , tommy .
what' s the matter ?
you got nothing to crack wise about ?
bernie ain' t so funny anymore ?
i guess i made kind of a fool of my self out there ... bawling away like a twist .
i guess
i guess i turned yellow .
you didn' t tell anyone about that ?
no .
of course , you know about it .
it' s a painful memory ... and i can' t help remembering that you put the finger on me , and you took me out there to whack me .
i know ... you didn' t .
i know .
you didn' t shoot me , but  but what have i done for you lately ?
don' t smart me .
see , i want to watch you squirm .
i want to see you sweat a little .
and when you smart me ... it ruins it .
there' s one other thing i want .
i want to see johnny caspar cold and stiff .
that' s what you il do for your friend bernie .
in the meantime , i' il stay out of sight .
but if caspar ain' t stiff in a couple of days ...
i start eating in restaurants .
oof ! .
uuh !
you make me laugh , tommy .
you' re gonna catch cold .
then you' re no good to me .
what were you gonna do if you caught me ?
i d just squirt a few , and then you' d let me go again .
hello , tad .
how' s the club holding up ?
we' re managing to squeak by without you .
got lazarre' s money ?
no .
you' re not supposed to be here since you turned rat .
relax , tad .
leo isn' t around , is he ?
last couple of days you booked any heavy bets on a long shot at saturday' s fights ?
why the hell should i tell you ?
the truth is , tad , no reason on earth .
saturday' s fights ?
drop johnson put two grand on one yesterday on sailor reese , an under card bum .
drop johnson .
he play your book much ?
are you kidding ?
i didn' t even know he could count .
jesus .
you bring them with you ?
hello , brian .
still fighting the good fight ?
hello , tom .
neither rain nor wind nor snow .
that' s the mailman .
o' doole here ?
hello , o' doole .
you don' t look happy .
look at this mess .
guttin ' the golden calf again .
i don' t know whether to laugh or cry .
yeah , it' s awful confusing .
you know a yegg named drop johnson ?
we spanked him a couple of times .
where does he flop ?
terminal hotel , bay street .
jesus !
look , don' t nobody ask me since i' m just the chief around here , but i' il tell you my opinion .
caspar is just as crazy as leo , and an eye tie into the bargain .
what' s the matter , o' doole ?
doesn' t anything ever suit you ?
hop in , tom .
we been lookin ' for you .
i' m busy .
hop in anyway .
you can' t hijack me , tic tac .
we' re on the same side now .
or didn t you get that far in school ?
how' d you get the fat lip ?
old war wound .
acts up around morons .
very smart .
what were you doing at the club , talking things over with leo ?
don' t think so hard , eddie .
you might sprain something .
you are so goddamn smart .
except you ain' t .
i get you , smart guy .
i know what you are .
straight as a corkscrew .
mr. inside out ski ,
like some goddamn bolshevik picking up his orders from yegg central .
you think you re so goddamn smart .
you join up johnny caspar , you bump bernie bernbaum .
up is down .
black is white .
well , i think you re half smart .
i think you were straight with your frail ,
i think you were queer with johnny caspar ... and i think you d sooner join a ladies ' league than gun a guy down .
then i hear from these two geniuses they never even saw this rub out take place .
boss said to have him do it .
he didn' t say nothing about  shut up !
or maybe you still got too many teeth .
everyone is so goddamn smart .
well , we' il go out to miller' s crossing ... and we' il see who' s smart .
**** [ frankie singing in italian ]
you understand if we don' t find a stiff out here , we leave a fresh one .
where are your friends when you need ' em , huh ?
where' s leo now ?
hey , tic tac !
you ever notice how the snappy dialogue dries up ... once a guy starts soiling his union suit ?
**** [ continues ]
** [ stops ]
** [ resumes ]
okay .
there' s nothing out here .
**** [ stops ]
**** [ resumes ]
think about this ... smart guy .
it' s hanky time .
** [ stops ]
birds have been at him .
jesus christ .
told you to put one in his brain , not in his stinkin ' face !
i told you , dane .
we heard two shots .
hello , drop .
how are the katzen jammers ?
hello , tom .
what' s the rumpus ?
had any visitors ?
uhh , no .
not ever , drop ?
not lately .
then you must be happy to see me .
so , uh ... you didn' t see bernie bernbaum before he was shown across .
uh , no .
seen him since ?
one last question , drop .
you got a lot of money on tomorrow' s fight .
that your bet , or , uh ... you placing it for a friend ?
no , no , no , it' s my bet .
i just have a good feeling about that fight .
a good feeling , huh ?
when did a feeling return to your head ?
you' ve outgrown that one .
must be all the thinking you been doing .
tell bernie something' s come up , he has to get in touch .
there' il be nothing stirring till i talk to him .
**** [ male irish tenor , indistinct ]
**** [ male irish tenor , indistinct ]
all right , anyone left in there , come on out grabbing air .
you know the drill .
aah !
hello , tom .
where you been hiding ?
hither and yon .
is the mayor in ?
he' s with mr. caspar .
that' s who i' m looking for .
scare me up some gargle , will you ?
sure .
i' il announce you .
don' t bother .
i' m well liked .
i can' t do it .
i' il look ridiculous .
it simply isn' t done .
assistants , maybe .
for a mayor , you don' t hear so hot .
i said head .
head of the assessor' s office .
but there are two of them .
i can count .
co heads .
johnny , needless to say , this office will do anything in its power ... to assist you and your cousins .
we did it for leo , of course , on countless occasions .
damn right .
had every potato eater from county cork on the public tit .
but there' s a way we do things , hallowed by usage and consecrated by time .
when we put people on the pad when leo was running things  leo ain' t runnin ' things !
i ain' t interested in ancient history !
i' m runnin ' things now !
nobody can appreciate it more than i.
i can give them jobs .
i can give them good jobs .
i can even give them jobs where they won t have to perform any work , where their lack of english will be no impediment , but i can' t
what is this , the high hat ?
tom , can you explain it to him ?
i can put them in public works , but i can' t
you can do whatever the hell caspar tells you .
i don' t remember all this double talk when leo gave you an order .
tom .
jesus !
stop whimpering and do as you' re told .
you can start by gettin ' out of here .
johnny , it' s my office .
get out of here !
take it on the heel and toe before i whack you one !
you two beat it .
yeah , go and keep the mayor company .
i' il take care of ya' s later .
runnin ' things it ain' t all gravy .
what' s the fireworks ?
knocking over one of leo' s clubs .
son of a bitch won' t go belly up .
i' m sorry , kid .
i heard about your little ride this morning .
yeah , well , sorry don' t fix things .
we could just as easily have missed bernie' s corpse , and i' d be dead now .
i know , i know , but that don' t mean the dane' s up to anything .
so he hears a rumor that bernie ain' t dead .
these stories pop up .
any stories about bernie being alive the dane' s made up himself .
you don' t know that .
it don' t make sense .
why would he ?
there could be a damn good reason ... if you got a fixed fight coming up .
do you ?
maybe .
okay , yeah , sure .
tomorrow night .
the fix is in .
what of it ?
the dane know about it ?
yeah .
okay , i get it .
if the dane' s been selling you out on these fights and means to again ,
he' s gonna have to have somebody else to point the finger at .
yeah , i get it .
with bernie dead , there ain' t a hell of a lot of people he can point to .
yeah , the dane sells me out , makes pretend bernie' s still doing it .
that' s real pretty .
bernie leaked the fix , and you take the fall for not killing him .
but i don' t know .
why would eddie cross me like that ?
money ?
okay , everybody likes money , but somehow it just don' t seem like him .
and i know the dane .
nobody knows anybody .
not that well .
money don' t mean that much to him .
then it' s not just the money he' s after .
he' s got a wart on his fanny .
huh ?
a warton his fanny giving him the fidgets .
maybe he' s sick of sitting on the couch .
maybe behind your desk don' t look like a bad place to move to .
kid , you got a lip on you .
but you re honest .
that' s something we can' t get enough of in this business .
i' il admit since last we jawed ... my stomach' s been seizing up on me .
if the dane' s saying we should double cross you
you double cross once , where' s it all end ?
an interesting ethical question .
i' il find the dane , talk to him , straighten things out .
sure , talk to him .
have a chat .
i' il take care of it .
ask him if he s selling you out .
i' m sure he' il come clean .
i' il take care of it .
you' re swimmin ' in it .
i said i' d take care of it !
johnny .
my chin' s hanging out right alongside yours .
i' d worry a lot less if i thought you were worrying enough .
but i am , kid .
christ .
running things .
yeah ?
i got your message .
oh , bernie .
i had a dream about you the other day .
yeah ?
a nightmare ?
on the contrary .
very sweet .
i dreamt you were lying out at miller' s crossing with your face blown off .
you get a kick out of that ?
i was in stitches .
it' s mink , isn' t it ?
i came back .
he wasn' t happy to see me .
can you beat that ?
some friend .
yeah .
you know what a nervous boy he was .
i figured you' re a friend , maybe you could use some insurance .
did mink have a . 22 ?
he already ditched it .
why ?
after he shot rug ?
yeah .
how' d you know ?
doesn' t matter .
i' ve been thinking about our deal .
you can stick it in your ear .
huh ?
you don' t have anything on me that i don' t have on you , so i' m calling your bluff .
wait a minute .
i' m pulling out tomorrow morning .
you only have to decide whether or not i leave behind a message for caspar ... that you re still around .
if you want me to keep my mouth shut , it' s gonna cost you some dough .
i figure a thousand bucks is reasonable , so i want two .
in a pig' s eye !
i' m going out .
i' il be back at 4 : 00 this morning .
if you re not here at my place , 4 : 00 , with the dough ,
caspar' s gonna be looking for you tomorrow .
wait , wait , wait !
got any money ?
no .
okay .
third race tonight .
by the finish , tailor made had a view of the field .
you oughta lay off the ponies , tom .
okay .
lazarre said he' s sorry about this .
it s just getting out of hand .
yeah .
he likes you , tom .
he said we didn' t have to break anything .
it' s okay .
tell him there' s no hard feelings .
heh !
christ , tom ... he knows that .
take care now .
tom reagan .
yes , sir .
mr. caspar' s in the great room .
swell .
can you hold these ?
kid , what' s the rumpus ?
i got news .
yeah .
news at this end too .
my stomach' s been seizing up on me .
mink just told me that he  eh ?
you talked to mink ?
yeah , on the phone .
the dane wants you to think that he' s disappeared so you can' t talk to him ,
but he' s been here in town .
you sure it was mink ?
yeah .
see for yourself .
he' s coming to my place , 4 : 00 this morning .
he' s afraid of a crossing with dane .
he told me about the fix .
he says he' il sing for a couple of grand skip money , tell us everyone involved .
but you d better take care of the dane tonight .
mink says he' s coming after us tonight .
leo' s holed up at whiskey nick' s dump .
what ?
how do you know ?
that ain' t all we know , smart guy .
recognize your playmate ?
you thought i' d quit , huh ?
uh uh .
i followed you this afternoon , and i wondered why einstein would wanna talk to a gorilla .
so i grabbed the gorilla , and i beat it out of him .
you give me a big guy every time .
they break easy .
not like you .
is there a point , or are you just brushing up on your small talk ?
i like that .
cool under fire .
i' m impressed .
the gorilla didn' t know whose stiff we found , but i can fill that in .
you killed mink , you son of a bitch !
it was mink , you son of a bitch .
it was mink , and by god , i' il hear you say it .
is this how you told drop his story ?
come here , bum .
i am gonna send you to a deep , dark place , and i am gonna have fun doing it .
oof ! .
you son of a bitch !
son of a bitch !
you lousy son of a bitch !
if there s one thing i can' t stand , it' s a double cross artist !
i had a theory about this son of a bitch !
shut up , you lousy son of a bitch , or i' il give you something to holler about !
johnny , it' s okay .
the dane made him do it .
it' s not important .
then make him shut it !
and we do the same to mink this very same night !
we can' t double cross mink .
he wants to spill the whole setup .
i' ve never let a son of a bitch walk .
you' ve never crossed anyone .
4 : 00 , my place .
mink' s coming in on his own hook , so i promised him the money .
don' t make me out to be a liar .
look at this , kid .
something i try to teach all my boys .
always put one in the brain .
what' s the rumpus ?
i was just in the neighborhood feeling a little daffy .
what are you doing ?
walking .
don' t let on more than you have to .
in the rain .
bernie' s dead , isn' t he ?
what makes you think that ?
that' s no answer .
i can' t tell you anything yet .
no one really cares , do they ?
his friends didn' t really like him .
he didn' t like his friends .
you' re someone to talk .
you' re a son of a bitch , tom .
you got me to tell you where he was , and then you killed him .
i want to know why .
what was in it for you ?
nothing for me .
giving up bernie was the only way i could see to straighten things out for leo .
i thought you said you didn' t care about leo .
i said we were through .
it' s not the same thing .
i don' t understand .
i don' t care .
i don' t care what reasons you had or you thought you had .
he' s still alive .
you expect me to believe you ?
no .
that' s you all over , tom .
a lie and no heart .
oh
it isn' t easy , is it , verna ?
but before you even think about doing that , you gotta towel down .
so you towel down first with a hot towel , as hot as you can stand .
put the razor in cold water , not hot , because metal does what in cold ?
i don' t know , johnny .
that' s why i m telling you !
it contracts .
that way you get a first class shave every time .
okay , johnny .
ain' t it the life though ?
hello , sal .
you can dangle .
hello , tom .
you sure ?
you don' t look so hot .
i' m okay .
i' il drive him home .
mr. reagan , there were shots .
go down to the drug store and call the police .
you' d better stay there till the officers arrive .
will my cats be all right ?
yeah , they' il be fine .
i get it .
you set me up .
anything to avoid a little dirty work yourself , huh ?
how' d you know he' d get it and not me ?
or didn t you care ?
i figured you' d come early looking for blood .
he wouldn' t , so you d likely have the drop on him .
you' re right .
the chump never knew what hit him .
but if you knew i d come to kill you , how do you know i won' t still ?
there s nothing init for you now .
with him dead , you and me got nothing on each other .
let me have the gun .
why ?
pin this on the dane .
neither of us want him walking around after this .
the cops' il be leo' s now .
they won t care what they hang the dane for .
i guess that' s true , if you don' t mind keeping the gun that killed caspar and mink .
why did mink shoot rug anyway ?
i don' t know .
it was just a mix up .
here .
so you re gonna say the dane did this ?
sure .
mink thought rug was tailing him .
you know mink .
hysterical .
skin full of hop , head full of boogey men .
comes home crying one day , saying he had to pop one of the dane' s spies .
rug was tailing verna , not mink .
mink just happened to be with her .
funny , ain' t it ?
mink was terrified the dane' d find out me and him were jungle dup together .
i bet you kept him worried about that to keep him under your thumb .
yeah , so what ?
scratch , huh ?
a little bonus .
why did mink take rug' s hair ?
beats me .
the kid was dizzy .
fifty fifty on the dough ?
or maybe i should get more , since i did the deed .
okay , you keep it .
i want you to have it .
bernie ... we can' t pin this on the dane .
why not ?
because the dane' s already dead halfway across town .
what the hell are you talking about ?
eddie dane is dead .
it' s gotta be you .
i mean , it was your gun .
what is this ?
what the hell are you talking about ?
you
you took my gun .
it' s just your word against mine .
not necessarily .
are you crazy ?
we' re square .
you said it yourself .
we got nothing on each other .
yep .
so what' s in it for you ?
there' s no angle .
you can t just shoot me like that .
jesus christ , it don' t make sense .
tommy
tommy !
look in your heart .
look in your heart .
what heart ?
tad ?
it' s tom .
tell lazarre i got his money .
yeah , all of it .
i wanna place a bet on tonight' s fight .
they set you up downstairs ?
how' s that ?
a little hooch , whatever ?
thanks for coming , tom .
leo' s real anxious to see you .
yeah , i happened to be near .
well , uh , actually this might not be the best time .
who' s he got in there ?
o' doole and the mayor .
i' il try again .
they' re planting the sheeny tomorrow .
you could stop by .
big turnout .
drop dead .
she' s under a lot of strain .
yeah , well , at least she didn' t hit me .
glad you came , tommy .
i guess , uh huh ?
she' s taking the car .
i guess we' re walkin ' .
guess we are .
we' re , uh we' re getting married .
congratulations .
funny thing is , she asked me to tie the knot .
i guess you' re not supposed to say that .
it doesn' t matter .
congratulations .
thanks .
hell , tom , why didn t you tell me what you were up to ?
i thought you d really gone over .
not that i didn' t deserve it , but you could' ve told me .
telling you would only have queered things if it
there just wasn' t any point .
i can see that .
it was a smart play all around .
i guess you know i' m grateful .
no need .
heh !
i guess you picked that fight with me ... just to check yourself in with caspar .
i don' t know .
do you always know why you do things , leo ?
sure i do .
it was a smart play .
fine .
jesus , tom , i' d do anything if you d work for me again .
i know i' ve made some bonehead plays , i know i can be pigheaded , but , damn it , so can you .
i need you .
things can be the way they were .
i know it .
i just know it .
as for you and verna , well , i understand .
you' re both young .
damn it , tom , i forgive you .
i didn' t ask for that , and i don' t want it .
good bye , leo .
