wonderful .
kathryn is president of the student body .
and president of the french club .
oui .
i live for extracurricular activities .
student president ?
i thought you were a sophomore .
i am .
i believe one shouldn' t be hampered in one' s goals ... ... simply by the paltriness of one' s years .
you mean " dearth .
excuse me ?
paltriness " implies insignificance .
but it' s lack of age that shouldn' t hamper you from achieving your goals .
careful with those sat words .
they can be deadly .
thank you .
isn' t kathryn just the best , son ?
yeah , she' s a real peach , dad .
i love you , stepdaddy .
i' m a little tired from travelling .
do you mind if i turn in ?
not at all .
i know you have a big day ahead of you tomorrow .
i' il show you to your room .
you little asshole , what do you think you' re doing ?
what ?
do you hear me ?
do not fuck with
so he outdoes you at piano .
he outdoes you at vocabulary .
i guess i overestimated you .
and don' t sulk .
it' s a sign of weakness .
yes , mother .
everything' s fine .
i was just checking up on you , mom .
look , i promised i' d take care of you , right ?
i' il talk to dad and get you into a better facility .
it' s the least he can do .
i love you too .

let' s get something straight !
i' ve got a great thing going with the rentals .
no curfew , not bothered about homework and a five figure allowance .
no one , and i mean no one , is about to threaten my cushy lifestyle .
especially not some two bit hick loser .
but  i don' t want to hear it .
now , as for school , stay out of my face and we' il get along just fine .
but if you cross me once , i' il bury your sorry ass .
understood ?
all right .
i' m glad we could have this little discussion .
not bad .
what' s the matter ?
this collar' s too tight .
i guess you' re only used to wearing mesh shirts where you come from .
more sat vocabulary builders ?
for your information , this happens to be my orientation speech .
who are you orienting ?
please , be more stupid .
i am the student body president .
ivy league schools eat extracurricular crap up .
you do know what an lvy league school is ?
stop !
gordon anderson .
looking good .
do me a favour .
pretend you don' t know me .
my god , you' re beautiful .
excuse me ?
i said you were beautiful .
thank you .
excuse me , but what did you mean by that remark ?
what remark ?
that i' m beautiful .
aren' t you ?
well , yeah .
no , no .
that' s
never mind .
you' re very strange .
i know .
are you here to see the headmaster ?
yeah .
i heard he' s a total joke .
i wouldn' t know .
the headmaster will see you now .
in all my years of education i' ve never seen a file quite like this .
4 . 0 gpa .
president of several clubs .
all star snowboarding for your county .
and several glowing letters from your teachers and your former principal .
we were very close , he and i , sir .
yes , it' s most impressive .
thank you .
perhaps ... ... a little too impressive .
thank you .
that aside , i' m sure an enterprising young man like yourself ... ... would be a welcome addition here at manchester .
thank you , sir .
come in .
you have a few grammaticals , but nothing reprehensible .
thank you , honey .
meet my daughter , danielle .
you' re both in the same class .
you look familiar .
have we met ?
no , i don' t think so .
are you sure ?
must' ve been someone else .
i' d better get going .
it was nice meeting you , sir .
ma' am .
good luck , sebastian .
thank you , sir .
he seems nice , don' t you think ?
we' il see .
hail to thee , o stars so bright
hail to thee , manchester
be seated .
we' il now hear from your new student body president ... ... kathryn merteuil .
fellow students , faculty ... ... administrators and custodians ... ... l would personally like to welcome each and every one of you ... ... to what i think will be manchester' s proudest year .
she' s such an inspiration .
i consider each and every one of you ... ... members of my manchester prep family .
with that said , i feel it is our responsibility ... ... to reach out and accept all new students ... ... as members of ....
and accept all new students as ....
settle down , people .
as i was saying ... ... l consider each and every one of you ... ... members of my manchester prep are you all right ?
sorry .
happens when i get nervous .
guess i need a bubble gum fix .
keep going .
you' re doing great .
thanks .
once again , as i was saying ... ... l consider each and every one of you ... ... members of my manchester prep family .
with that said , i feel it is our responsibility ... ... to reach out and accept all new students
somebody do something !
good going , danielle .
danielle !
danielle !
danielle !
bravo !
terrific .
right .
sparing me the cliff notes synopsis ... ... who can tell me what this means ?
mr. winkler .
jekyil is a doctor who developed this potion that transformed him ... ... into edward hyde , his evil side .
my gosh ... ... did that answer suck !
come on , i know you' ve got it in you .
what themes ... ... can be discussed here ?
ms. sherman .
i think he' s talking about the duality of man .
man has both good and evil in him .
if man cannot suppress his evil instincts , he is inevitably doomed .
wrong !
care to elaborate ?
nowhere in the novel does he mention good over evil .
just the opposite .
jekyil loved hyde so much that he protected him .
yes , so he wouldn' t hurt people .
please !
he loved hurting people .
why does he kill himself ?
where does it say that ?
at the end .
utterson found his body .
utterson was idiotic .
your point' s idiotic !
all right , all right , break it up , you two .
wow !
am i losing my mind , or did we witness an intellectual debate ?
although i disagree with your conclusions , mr. valmont ... ... l appreciate your warped point of view .
as for you , ms. sherman ... ... l think you could be more tolerant of other people' s opinions .
hey , fellas , welcome back .
hey , good to see you .
assistant headmaster muller !
assistant headmaster muller !
steve .
i told you not to call me by my first name .
we need to talk .
i' m a little busy right now .
stop that !
i said , we need to talk .
what is it ?
do you see something wrong ?
i have gym .
you know i loathe gym .
we merteuils don' t perspire .
what is this " we merteuils " ?
you' re a student .
try acting like one .
excuse me ?
look , rules are rules .
i' m sorry , but you' re going to gym .
i understand .
you do ?
yes .
but ... ... it' s a bit strange , because isn' t it against the rules ... ... for someone of your age to seduce a minor like you did to me this summer ?
now you know that' s not entirely true .
it was you who seduced me .
you know ... ... you' re right .
it was me who seduced you .
but who will the school board believe ?
it' s my word against yours .
think about it .
this could ruin your career .
not to mention your marriage .
but i guess if you can bend the rules a little ... ... then so can l .
i' il see what i can do .
you' re the best .
the manchester tribunal will come to order .
kathryn merteuil presiding .
thank you , blaine .
fellow students of affluence and popularity ... ... welcome to this year' s first meeting of the tribunal .
as your new leader , i promise to do my best to weed out the geeks ... ... losers and underprivileged ... ... and toss their fat asses out of our school .
here' s the shipment , mrs. gagin .
thank you .
could you reshelf these for me ?
thanks .
oh , my god !
it' s like a cartoon cock .
hi .
are you all right ?
you scared me to death .
you dropped this .
i didn' t drop it .
yes , you did .
but it' s okay .
sexual curiosity' s nothing to be ashamed of .
i' m not ashamed and i have a very healthy sexual curiosity .
really ?
what are you doing here ?
i work here .
could you take a break and join me for coffee ?
i' d love to , but unfortunately i have a lot of work to do here .
mrs. gagin , do you mind if danielle joins me for a coffee break ?
please , go right ahead .
there' s nothing to do right now .
thank you .
you don' t quit , do you ?
what happened to " be nice to the new kid " ?

this girl is a walking teletubbie just begging to be made an example of .
i think i' il oversee this one personally .
when i get through with her , she' il be the premiere slut at manchester .
next order of business , grievances .
yes , lauren ?
it appears we' re having a bit of trouble with the new school chef .
mr. washington seems to think that sushi ... ... is an inappropriate meal for growing girls and boys .
all those in favour of sending him back to his hot dog stand , say " aye .
aye !
okay , bye bye , mr. washington .
hello , mr. yakamoto .
so , what' s a nice girl like you doing at a snobbish school like manchester ?
it' s called free tuition .
besides , it' s not as bad as it seems .
my dad took over a year after my mom passed away .
i' m sorry .
your turn .
okay .
folks split up 1 0 years ago .
mom has a drug problem .
everyone thought it' d be best if i moved in with my dad .
you get along with him ?
i don' t really know him .
he' s on his fourth marriage .
to kathryn' s mom ?
yeah .
i know this is rude , but what' s it like growing up with all that money ?
i' il let you know .
i' m only one day into it .
sorry to disappoint you , but richie rich i' m not .
and i thought i was the only one at manchester .
you ever get the feeling you' re being watched ?
yours ?
hers .
there you are , silly goose .
i' ve been looking for you .
hi , danielle .
how' s the used book store ?
don' t let her get to you .
she doesn' t .
maybe it makes me uncool , but i don' t care what she thinks of me .
actually , i think that makes you very cool .
i better go before she makes me hitch a ride home .
thanks for coffee .
i' il call you .
you don' t have my number .
don' t underestimate me .

each lapse , each oversight will be reported .

the perfect windsor is an art .

i can' t do this from a phone .
but it' s a good phone .
digital .

i' il look silly .
close them now .
danielle , wait !
it' s like they say , the best laid plans ... ... sometimes suck .
miss merteuil .
but i' m excused from gym .
gym , yes .
ballet , no .
there must be something i can do to change your mind .
i think you' ve got the wrong guy .
now , get your ass to ballet .
mr. erwick .
if it was to continue between us , you had to keep me out of gym and ballet .
i can' t do anything , all right ?
hargrove called me into his office .
he' s suspicious .
and why do you think that is ?
well , i' m not sure .
the disciplinary committee , of course .
you stammered like a whipped fool .
it was obvious you voted the way i wanted you to .
but that' s how you did want me to vote .
oh , my god , i' m a mess .
you' re always one step ahead of me .
i don' t know what to do .
it' s a dirty old man' s catch 22 .
shut up , steve .
get control of yourself .
i can' t !
i' m falling apart .
my wife doesn' t turn me on anymore .
my kids hate me .
i should just quit .
stop blubbering .
i' il go back to gym and ballet .
you will ?
the excuse slips were just a test .
a day will come when i' il need you for a favor , a big favor .
and you' il do it without question .
capiche ?
of course .
i worship you , kathryn .
worship works best on your knees .
oh , kathryn .
be quiet .
i' m trying to imagine i' m with someone attractive .
sorry .
hello !
anybody ?
oh , my god , she is terrible !
if it' s so bad , why don' t you guys just quit ?
it' s steady employment , sir .
it' s a good address .
we could be down in the 50s .
or worse .
scarsdale .
ladies there make me crazy !
all the time sending me to the market , looking for gefilte .
my father , fisherman for 20 years .
he never caught one gefilte .
what is a gefilte ?
three kings .
man !
beats my two pairs .
i got crap .
full house , jacks over threes .
you win again , master sebastian .
i really wish you' d quit with the " master " thing .
but , sir , it' s your title .
it shows privilege .
what has it gotten me ?
i bought gifts but didn' t get the girl .
danielle hates my wealth or resents it or something .
perhaps it' s not my place to speak .
please .
i' m desperate here .
she doesn' t want to feel like she' s being bought .
is that it ?
i don' t know .
women are complicated creatures .
it' s been my experience that women are more interested ... ... in the soul of a man than in his trappings .
what is going on around here ?
i had to ring and ring .
and where were you , frederick ?
i paged you four times .
i had to take a cab .
a cab !
i' m sorry .
we were
get out of here , all of you .
you can be sure my mother will hear about this .
no , she won' t .
what did you say ?
you' re not telling anybody about this .
i ordered them to play cards .
and to drink mother' s prized 1 939 neuf du pape ?
great year .
blitzkrieg , wasn' t it ?
don' t get smart .
whether you realize it or not , you' re still a guest here .
you treat them like dirt .
no wonder they don' t respect you .
we pay them for service , not respect .
maybe someday you' il learn that .
and one day you' il realize that they' re human beings .
just give me a second .
party' s over .
you know , i don' t get it .
if you hate your mother so much ... ... why work so hard to be just like her ?
is that what you think ?
you' re obviously trying to prove something to someone .
no one' s this mean , unless ... ... there' s pain and suffering behind it .
you think it' s tough having to come to this house with strange people ?
try growing up here .
try spending every moment of your life just making up for just being here .
that doesn' t make any sense .
no , it doesn' t .
you feel out of place , sebastian ?
you want to fit in ?
guess what ?
so do l .
what a mess .
hello ?
sebastian ?
it' s cherie .
danielle is totally , madly in love with you .
madly in love ?
she hates me .
every move i make is the wrong move .
but she told me stuff .
every time she thinks about you and sees you , she gets all moist .
moist ?
her eyes .
she gets tears in them .
but time' s running out .
you gotta move now .
she' il be in the city .
dinner with her aunt at the riverside cafe .
i figure if you go there , bare your soul ....
no gifts , though .
she hates that money thing .
hello ?
closet street performer .
now you know all my secrets .
how' d you know i was here ?
nope .
already know .
cherie the blabbermouth .
weird girl , but beyond the " totallys " and " oh , my gods , " there' s truth there .
i have to catch my train .
i' il make sure you get home all right .
you can come to the station , only if you do it without talking .
not another word .
that' s my condition .
condition accepted .
all right .
stop !
i give up , okay ?
we can talk .
stop playing that thing .
you know , i think this is the most romantic city on earth .
millions of strangers meeting in restaurants , parks , sidewalks .
a romance born every five seconds .
every heartbeat .
god , is this a great city or what ? !
this is exactly what i' m talking about .
you spout b. s. on a continuous basis .
i can' t say what i really want to .
say it !
okay .
i want to know what happened at school , in the courtyard .
i kissed you and you just ran off .
i' m crazy about you .
i' m trying all i can to make you like me .
be yourself .
be honest .
why is that so difficult ?
i don' t know .
maybe i' m scared .
you know , i' m new here , right ?
new to this city ... ... new at school ... ... living in a house full of certifiable wackos .
i don' t have any friends .
at least any i can trust .
and i' m confused .
god' s honest truth , i' m in a state of perpetual confusion .
what are you scared of ?
missing my train .
see you at school .
bye .
as you know , your mother gets home tonight .
and you want me to keep quiet about the poker game .
i don' t like the ideas sebastian' s putting in your head .
i mean no disrespect .
well , i' m offended .
leave .
i' il finish alone .
min lin , wait .
let' s get to know each other like you did with sebastian .
do i have to ?
come on , it' il be fun .
here .
i' il jump right in .
where are you from ?
china ?
japan ?
cambodia , actually .
cambodia , wonderful country .
when did you come to our united states ?
my family fled through vietnam .
ultimately , we were 1 20 crammed into a boat the size of your pantry .
that reminds me of a time in denver .
we were coming home from aspen .
first class was packed .
we almost had to fly coach .
anyway , so your family fled the khmer rouge ?
nothing subtle about that shade of rouge .
see , we do have a lot in common .
will there be anything else ?
no , that' s all .
i' m glad we did this , aren' t you ?
oh , yes .
very enlightening .
bitch .
you got all your pronouns mixed up .
nous is " we , " vous is " you .
unless it' s someone you' re crazy , madly in love with .
in which case it' s tu , as in you and sebastian .
that thing with the phone , so cool .
if it had been me , i would' ve piddled right there .
did i show you my doodle ?
excuse me ?
my doodle , my sketch .
you' ve got some talent , cherie .
just tell me , do you really like him ?
ls it the real thing ?
like i even know what that is .
knees go weak , mouth goes dry ... ... you get that tingling feeling in that special place .
he' s just so slick , so sure of himself .
i have trouble trusting him .
he can' t just talk to me , say what he' s really feeling .
neither can l .
okay .
chapter three .
read the translation of the first passage .
love is the sublime melting pot in which ... ... man and woman are fused together .
the lover is a priest ... ... the ravished virgin , a trembling sacrifice .
a priest and a virgin ?
oh , that' s sick !
move .
move .
move .
hi , mr. nago .
hello , ladies .
i make a special eel and cuke roll today .
it' s so sad about mr. washington .
the fact that they found a dead rat in that student' s sloppy joe .
he' il never work again .
you never told us how it went with cherie .
did you bury her ?
let' s just say she' s on her way to ruin .
everything' s set for this weekend .
what are you talking about ?
i told my mom how much fun we had , and she invited you and your mom over .
your mom told my mom you can sleep over .
i got the new hanson album !
i gotta go .
gordon anderson promised to show me his one eyed snake .
whatever that is .
okay , see you .
maria , hola .
ay , caramba !
wow , kathryn , you really showed her .
don' t talk .
don' t say a word .
it' s my turn to explain .
all i' ve done is hound you about being honest ... ... when i couldn' t do it myself .
that kiss in the courtyard , sebastian ... ... it was more than just a kiss .
i' il say .
let me finish .
you see ... ... it was my first kiss .
i wanted it to be perfect and with the right boy .
while you might be the right boy , the rest was not right .
god , i embarrassed you .
i embarrassed myself .
i know you' re used to girls with experience ... ... and you' ve been kissing girls forever .
that' s what i was afraid to say .
i happen to think this is wonderful .
so you weren' t exactly up front and honest .
join the club .
i wanted it to be perfect ... ... not the tail end of some prank .
does that make any sense ?
yeah .
you know , some things can' t be orchestrated .
some things have to be spontaneous .
like a kiss .
like the kiss we' re about to have right now .
say something .
quick .
i can' t .
i have to go .
last bell .
okay , but ... ... just back away so i know you' re not running away .
that was wonderful .
just precious .
how long were you there ? " i' ve never kissed a boy before , the right boy ... ... and you' ve probably been kissing girls forever .
you must feel like a terrible dope , leading on that lovesick girl .
what are you talking about ?
here' s a prediction .
a few weeks of hand holding and smooching ... ... and you' il be so horny you' il mess it up .
i could wipe her off the map tomorrow ... ... but i think i' il let this romance flicker out on its own .
i like her .
do anything to screw it up , and i' il screw you up .
nobody ever threatens me .
i just did , or weren' t you listening ?
you do realize this means war .
then war it is .
lovely .
i feel badly for you ... ... but byron needs to be groomed every day at 3 .
just reschedule your daughter' s birthday .
i want him saddled and ready to ride when i arrive .
don' t make me wait .
idiot .
there' s a new student , cherie clayman .
did she die ?
i take it you don' t like her .
i can' t stand her .
she' s actually very sweet , so i' m turning her into the school slut .
she' s now your new best friend .
why ?
don' t tell me you' re hitting up the claymans for a donation .
sorry , mother .
i think it' s an excellent idea .
the claymans will be joining us at 7 .
you invited them here ?
mother , they' re from california .
kathryn , i need this .
20 million more and we can break ground on the tiffany merteuil library .
well , you ladies seem to be enjoying yourselves .
you must be tense , sebastian .
you' d be too if you were failing gym .
who ever heard of fencing as a sport ?
perhaps a massage would help .
i' ve never had a massage before .
you can have my table .
i' m suddenly not in the mood .
tack sa myckesh .
mycket , " not " myckesh .
if you don' t say it correctly , don' t say it at all .
it just makes you look foolish .
thank you for the correction , mother .
if you' il excuse me .
i think i could get used to this .
dead puppies , dead puppies , dead puppies .
old nuns in their underwear .
i thought you' d left .
is that sonia or lngrid ?
it' s tiffany .
i hope you enjoyed your massage .
i think i' il go take a shower .
we' ve had so little time together , sebastian .
can' t be a happy family if we don' t get to know each other better .
you' re right , " mom .
we should talk more , mom .
with your father working on the yacht so much , i have time .
some nights , he doesn' t even come home .
he loves that yacht .
i' m glad he found something he' s so committed to .
the right woman will do that .
you think i' m the right woman ?
definitely .
he' s a changed man .
of course he' s changed .
without me , he' d still be giving charters to geriatrics .
it' s not the money , it' s you .
he loves you .
you' re a smart boy .
you seem to understand your father very well .
i hope so .
so do l .
because if you' re wrong , you' il both end up on the street .
she spanked me .
oh , baby , that feels so good !
you like that ?
dad , you here ?
fuck !
fuck !
hey , son , how' s it going ?
in bed already ?
just a catnap .
what are you doing ?
i' m just looking for the cat .
here , puss , puss , puss .
i hope you' re not suggesting i' m having an affair .
i' m not suggesting anything .
i' m your father and i will not be treated like a criminal !
a criminal ?
you could' ve fooled me .
and behind door number three we have ....
hello .
sebastian , i' d like you to meet lilly ... ... my first mate .
lilly , i' m sebastian , edward' s son .
oh , my god , you have your father' s eyes .
are you a libra ?
let' s just cut right to the chase .
he offered to sail you around the world , didn' t he ?
how' d you know ?
leave right now , or you' re grounded for a week .
did he tell you he was married ?
i was waiting for the right time .
you lied to me ?
more an error of omission .
you see , she' s very sick .
i may be single any day now .
go to hell !
sebastian , you think you could help me out here ?
okay , okay .
i know we talked about this .
but you' re a man and you have to understand
no , you have to understand .
it' s not just your life , it' s mine too .
don' t screw it up for me .
absolutely .
you can count on me , son .
the keys , please ?
you know , you made your bed .
now lie in it .
well ... ... this sucks .
i can' t believe i was so stupid .
i really thought your dad liked me .
it' s not your fault .
he' s the master of deceit .
he should be in the liars ' hall of fame .
he was in the hall of fame ?
never mind .
can i ask you something ?
why are men such jerks ?
is it genetic or something ?
they promise you the world , that you' re the one for them ... ... and that their wives don' t understand them anymore .
and i fall for it every time !
i' m like a doormat !
they' re always coming and going and coming and going and coming ....
my life sucks .
lilly , you don' t need a man to be happy .
if you' re not happy alone , you won' t be happy with someone else .
you' re an attractive woman .
you can have anyone you want .
you just have to wait for the right guy to come along .
you think i' m attractive ?
i think you' re beautiful .
you' re so sincere .
you' re not like your father at all .
glad you were paying attention .
want to come back to my place ?
i' d love to , but i have an oral report due in the morning .
i' m great at orals .
try me .
no , thank you .
i' m gonna split .
will you be okay ?
i' il be fine .
psycho .
i lived in fresno my whole life .
les too .
but we wanted more for cherie .
when les sold the biz , we moved to the big apple .
and how are you finding manchester ?
it' s no problem .
our driver , he takes me right there .
she' s asking you if you like it .
oh , yeah , it' s the best .
and kathryn' s been so super nice .
they told me to stay away from her ... ... like she had permanent pms or something .
gross !
but she' s been totally awesome .
she' il be very popular .
not as popular as you .
popular is such a bore .
school spirit is important ... ... and nobody has as much as my mother .
i do some work for the fundraising committee .
you are so modest .
mother' s already raised half the money needed for the new library .
how much have you raised ?
she barely does anything .
the parents practically throw it at her .
why do they throw money at you ?
because charity is smiled upon by the ladies who lunch .
society , cherie .
you know , the social ladder .
my mom said now that we' re rich , we gotta start climbing that thing .
what ?
isn' t she precious ?
will you excuse me ?
certainly .
pardon me .
so , how much money do you need ?
i didn' t invite you over here to discuss fundraising , bunny .
but if you' d make a donation , we' d certainly consider it .
really ?
why , thank you .
my pleasure .
hi , honey .
how was your day ?
i can explain this .
there' s no need to explain .
i know you love my mother very much .
yes , exactly .
and sebastian and i are just getting close .
i know you' d never do anything to break up our happy home .
no , never .
so let' s make sure it stays happy .
i want you to take mother to au troquet for dinner tomorrow at 8 .
an accordion player will pass your table .
request " under my thumb " by the rolling stones .
mick jagger makes her hot .
got it .
while she' s listening , slip this on her finger ... ... then kiss her .
eight seconds , no tongue .
you getting this ?
after dinner , grappa , one glass .
bring her home , make love to her .
two viagra .
any questions ?
just in case , i' ve written it down for you .
who' s your favourite daughter ?
you are ?
what a shame .
morning !
great day , isn' t it ?
bite me , rich boy !
new york .
what a wonderful town .
you look fabulous .
thank you .
you got everything ?
you all set ?
you better take some money just in case you need a cab , miss the train .
don' t worry .
i' il be fine .
come on , this is my job to worry .
you know ?
what' s wrong ?
nothing .
i just thought about your mom .
go on , have a good time .
okay .
bye .
sebastian thought you' d like it better than the train .
i am so excited !
but i' m nervous .
i' ve never been on a horse .
don' t worry .
i won' t let anything bad happen to you .
if i like it , dad will buy me a horse .
we can spend every weekend together .
you' il love it .
i promise .
very good , cherie .
back on the horse .
i think we' re ready to try advanced jumping .
i don' t know .
he keeps throwing me off .
all right , if you' re going to be a scaredy cat ... ... l guess we' d better go back to the basics .
manuela !
nice horsey .
using the stirrups , i want you to push up and down in the saddle .
that' s called " posting .
now add the back and forth motion .
when you hit the saddle , push backward , then forward .
up and down , back and forth .
faster , faster .
up and down , back and forth .
faster , faster .
good .
this time i want you to really grind into the saddle .
how does that feel ?
i think i' m getting it .
posting is fun .
faster .
faster .
faster .
really fun !
are you okay ?
i' ve never felt better .
now i know why girls like horses .
wait .
i don' t know if i' m ready for this .
it' s cool .
i' m sorry .
it' s just that yesterday was my first kiss .
and now you' re practically touching my breast .
at this rate , your dick will be in my mouth by lunch .
anyone for lunch ?
i' m kidding .
listen , we can take this as slow as you want .
i like you .
i have no need to rush things .
that' s not my problem .
i want to rush things .
i' m tired of being the only virgin in the sophomore class .
are you telling me that everyone in the sophomore class has done it ?
well , it sure feels like it .
i don' t know .
ever feel like you' re at war with yourself ?
constantly .
one side of me wants you to throw me down ... ... right here and rip my clothes off .
and then another side of me thinks ... ... l should wait till i' m married .
which side should i choose ?
you really want me to answer that ?
come on , be my friend .
listen , danielle , i know exactly what you' re going through .
we have two sides .
i struggle with my dark side every day .
but that was the old me .
believe it or not , i have you to thank for it .
you showed me that it was okay to be a decent person .
how dark was your past ?
pitch black .
i' m thinking ....
i think i' m falling in love with you .
but i' m afraid to take the chance to get hurt .
i' m afraid of getting hurt too .
listen , let' s make a pact .
we' il take it slow and we won' t hurt each other .
god , we sound like a cancelled television series .
you don' t have to do this .
i want to .
hello ?
hi , daddy .
yeah , i know .
i' m running late .
tell aunt gloria we can still make the 2 : 00 mass .
i' il call you when i get there .
i love you too .
you gotta go ?
sorry .
it' s okay .
call me later ?
toodles .
bye bye .
oh , my balls !
here' s something you might like .
dolce .
how ' 98 of you .
carry any real fur ?
no .
all of our fur is faux .
of course , the animals .
how silly of me .
i figured you' d be here .
what' s up ?
it' s about sebastian .
give me the dirt .
he has quite a checkered past .
he was able to pay off that overnight delivery guy ... ... and switch his school file .
that' s impressive by my standards .
that' s the tip of the iceberg .
well done .
cash or charge ?
be there in an hour .
the new van der beek film' s playing in town .
you sure your dad won' t mind ?
no , he' s out of town .
it' s just me and mr. whiskers .
mr. whiskers ?
my pussy , silly .
okay .
i' il see you soon .
all right , bye .
the virgin' s alone with her pussy , and i' m taking her to see dawson .
god , i' ve become a total fag .
i guess i misjudged you .
what are you talking about ?
how' d you get this ?
i have my ways .
kathryn , i' m trying to start over  blah , blah , blah .
please .
spare me any sob stories .
oh , dear .
something like this could destroy your clean reputation at manchester .
and that psychologist' s report about your mom .
how will she pay for rehab when i tell mommy where her money' s going ?
you' re playing with fire .
poor sebastian' s mom will be homeless .
eating leftovers out of the garbage .
you don' t know what i' m capable of .
yes , i do .
i read your file .
it turns me on .
fuck off .
going to see danielle ?
leave her out of it .
looks like we' ve hit a sensitive spot .
do you really think you can change , sebastian ?
face it .
you and i are two of a kind .
we' re just not cut out for good deeds .
i know the drill .
you' il date danielle .
probably sleep with her after what , you think eight months ?
and then you' il get bored , and you' il break her heart .
why don' t you just spare her the pain ?
and do what , date you ?
we could make a good team .
what do you plan on doing with my file ?
do i sense a merger in the air ?
perhaps .
you do realize you' re my stepsister .
you know what they say about incest .
is there any line you won' t cross ?
only one .
never in the butt .
that' s a good line .
the bradys never had it so good .
i can' t do this .
not with your pants on .
i gotta go .
you fucking pussy .
i gotta get out of this house .
is this about danielle ?
you don' t understand .
i love her .
you have a funny way of showing it .
i won' t let you corrupt me .
don' t you see ?
you can' t change .
i can try .
you' re gonna die trying .
hello ?
hello , danielle .
danielle ?
danielle !
sebastian , you' re soaking .
we have to talk .
come inside before you give yourself pneumonia .
thanks .
what' s wrong ?
i don' t know .
it' s okay .
you can talk to me .
go slow .
i feel like i' m losing it .
i gotta get out of new york .
it' s kathryn , isn' t it ?
i don' t think i can beat her .
sebastian , do you believe in a higher power ?
do you believe love conquers all ?
yes .
do you believe in our love ?
it' s all that' s keeping me together .
so you believe in our love ?
yes , i believe in our love .
because i sure as hell don' t .
what ?
fucking idiot .
bravo .
i told you i could do it .
never doubted you .
don' t tell me you bought that virgin bullshit ?
no , i saw you .
you were with your dad .
what he doesn' t know can' t hurt him .
i' m the headmaster' s daughter .
daddy' s little angel must keep up appearances .
holy fuck !
oh , don' t be such a baby .
you didn' t really think you' d win ?
you' re welcome to join us .
you know what they say .
two' s company .
three' s a fuckload of fun .
if you can' t beat them ....
who says you can' t beat them ?
share and share alike .
sebastian , now you' il have something to write about .
danielle .
oh , shit !
are you okay ?
i' m fine .
you really should try to be more careful .
thank you .
my bike !
could we offer you a ride ?
sorry , my mom said i' m not allowed to take rides from strangers .
it' s you !
i was just going to danielle' s house .
i' il take care of the bike .
oh , my god , thank you .
i owe you huge .
no problem .
it' s debbie , right ?
no , cherie .
whatever .
has anyone told you you could be a model ?

too bad you' re not sexy .
