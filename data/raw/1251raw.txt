new year' s eve , 1999 .
it' s being called the party of the century ... but it may be the biggest ever .
no one' s seen preparations like this ... but preparations require care and insurance ... and the lapd is one insurance company ... that doesn' t want accidents .
put you on a reservation
black nation
die underyour step and fetch a military lie
the bodies of two men found under the hollywood freeway ... have been identified as rap starjeriko one ... and band memberjames polton , known to fans as replay .
both were shot in what police are characterizing ... as an execution style killing .
the body of an unidentified woman ... was found with them , also shot numerous times .
police said the killings appearto be gang related .
with his band , prophets of light ...
jeriko one' s outspoken political stance and violent lyrics ... have stirred nationwide controversy .
meanwhile , astrologers have been busy ... making predictions for the coming century .
some of their fortune telling is indeed incredible
muammar qaddafi will be awarded the nobel peace prize .
turkey will make reparations to armenia .
by 2025, there will be a second woman president ...
hey , lenny .

tassel shoes .
entertainment law would be my guess .

a virgin brain .
we' re gonna start you off right .
just save us some time , tell me what you know .
just what i' ve read .
that the technology was developed for the feds ... to replace the body wire , and now it' s gone black market .
that' s right , so ... this conversation' s not taking place , ok ?

i' il get you a deck at my cost .
my thing is the software .
clips , right ?
clips .
right .
listen , i want you to know what we' re talking about here .
this is not " like tv , only better .
this is life .
it' s a piece of somebody' s life .
it' s pure and uncut , straight from the cerebral cortex .
you' re there .
you' re doing it .
you' re seeing it , hearing it .
you' re feeling it .
you' re feeling it .
what kind of things , exactly ?
anything .
whatever you want , whoever you wanna be .
want to go skiing without leaving your den, you can ... but i' m assuming that a guy like you ... you want to ski , you fly to aspen .
that' s not what you' re interested in .
it' s ...
it' s about the stuff that you can' t have , right ?
the forbidden fruit , hmm ?
running into a liquor store with a . 357 magnum in your hand ... feeling the adrenaline pumping through yourveins , huh ?
or see that guy with the drop dead filipino girlfriend ?
wouldn' tyou like to be that guy fortwenty minutes ?
the right twenty minutes .
i can make it happen ... and you won' t even tarnish your wedding ring .
sounds good .
i can get you what you want .
i can get you anything .
just talk to me .
you have to trust me , ok ?
' cause i' m your priest .
i' m your shrink .
i am your main connection to the switch board of souls .
i' m the magic man .
the santa claus of the subconscious .
you say it , you think it, you can have it .
you want a girl ?
you want two girls ?
i don' t know what your thing is , what you' re curious about .
you want a guy ?
maybe you want to be a girl .
hey, think of that .
be a girl .
see what that feels like .
maybe you want a nun to tie you up .
it' s all doable .

prick .

you always got to dress like a fucking pimp ?
this tie cost more than your entire wardrobe .
that' s not saying much .
it' s the one thing ... that stands between me and the fucking jungle .
to the jungle ... where some shit bird can cap you in the head ... and that' il ruin your whole day .
you were lucky , max .
so darned lucky , i wake up with a twenty two in my brainpan ... and a cop pension i can' t live off of .
damn !
it' s a good thing i wasn' t luckier .
bobby , hit me again .
you seen faith lately ?
she won' t call me .
just as well .
sure , faith was the most outstanding woman ... a guy like you could ever hope to get ... and it' s completely humiliating that she' s gone ... but you got to face that it' s over .
thanks , chaplain .
i' m touched by your concern .
i just hate to see you pining away , man .
you' re myfriend .
it makes me want to vomit .

it' s a rolex .
i' il be right back .
two minutes .
two minutes ?
son of a bitch .
what happened to your car this time ?
see , lenny , if you packed your piece ... you could make the guy see sense .
bobby, turn this up .
you watch us take it all
and then you' il understand our pain
we' il make you the rat
that crawled through the cracks
you love that red, white , and blue
but you hate the black , black , black
and you tryin ' to make me think
i did this to myself
when the drugs i smoke
and the guns i tote
both came from your shelf
but i never had a dream , ' cause
my life is a nightmare
america' s been my boogieman
for four hundred years
are you asking me how i feel ?
we felt jeriko .
we listened to him .
the lapd is a military force ... turned against its own people .
we live in a police state ...
hey , macey .
shh . ... with their social programs that don' twork .
they' re rearranging deck chairs on the titanic .
but a new day is coming .
two k is coming .
the day of reckoning is upon us .
history ... ends and begins again ... right here ... right now !
right on !
to the end of all things .
you know how i know it' s the end of the world ?
no .
tell me .
' cause everything' s already been done, you know ?
every kind of music' s been tried ... every government' s been tried , every fucking hairstyle ... bubble gum flavors , cereal , every type of fucking .
what are we going to do ?
how are we going to make another thousand years ?
i' m telling you , it' s over .
we used it all up .
what' s this week' s sad story ?
they jerked my wheels .
it' s outrageous the computer errors the banks make .
have you noticed ?
no , i haven' t , because i make my payments .
so , max peltier , how' s the p. i. business ?
sucks .
but when i get this new logo
i want to hear this scumbag .
do you have any leads ?
why wasn' t jeriko one provided adequate security ?
he always had adequate security available to him .
he chose not to have those encumbrances in his life .
why' s he a scumbag ?
you know who left lenny for him .
faith left lenny for him ?
don' t say faith .
use the " f " word around lenny , it triggers a maudlin display ... and you gotta tranquilize him .
shh .
i' ve lost afriend , a man of great courage ... which is more than i can say for most of us .
if you' re riding  let' s go .
fuck you, you pig !
driving mr. lenny .
it' s going to be a big night .
can' t you feel it ?
the energy in the air .
there' s money to be made , dreams to sell .
sleaze to peddle .
that is so unenlightened .
i sell experiences .
the way i see it , i' m performing a humanitarian service .
i probably save lives .
i wanna hear this part .
everybody needs to walk to the dark end of the street .
it' s what we are .
now the risks are out of line .
the streets are a war zone .
sex can kill you .
you slip on the ' trodes and get what you need ... almost as good as the real thing and a lot safer .
porno .
face it , you sell porno to wireheads .
harsh and untrue .
my clients are professionals .
they' re people with taste .
some are even celebrities .
what celebrities ?
the guy from the news .
he does the weather .
that counts .
you passed la cienega .
i' m not taking it .
it' s the quickestway to the club .
i' ve got business there .
i' m meeting people .
mace, you' re myfriend .
plus i' il give you twenty five percent of what i make tonight .
this may be a hard concept for you ... but friends don' t have to pay their friends .
faith is singing .
i should have known .
look ...
i pulled twelve hours .
i gotta get some sleep .
i got one last pickup at the st. james club .
they got a taxi stand .
you can catch a cab .
a taxi ?
well , someone might see me .
hold it right there , ma' am .
whoa .
hold it right there .
damn it , lenny , you made me late .
what' s your pickup' s name ?
i' il find him .
fumitsu .
fumitsu ?
fumitsu .
fumitsu .
you can leave the car right there .
oh, fuck .
nero .
strickland .
commissioner strickland .
since you shit canned my career , i don' t have to call you " sir .
it' s one of life' s small pleasures .
aren' t you peddling a little far from your usual gutter ?
i was invited here by a close friend mr. fumitsu .
he' s right over there .
i don' t like disappointments , nero .
you know what disappoints me very much ?
your sex life ?
excuse me .
mr. fumitsu .
leonard nero , bls limousine and security service .
i' ve arranged for one of our finest drivers ...
lornette mason , to take care of you .
she' s a security specialist trained in defensive combat .
of course, the car' s bullet proof and fully armored .
i' il be coming along to complete our periodic driver evaluation .
with your permission , of course .
we do it to ensure that our vlp clients ... are always treated as honored guests .
good evening , mr. fumitsu .
sir , please watch your head .
excuse me , mr. nero .
excuse me , sir !
what the fuck are you doing ?
coming with you .
you will not live to see the morning .
drive on .
are you a cop ?
no .
good .
have you ever been wired ?
wired ?
the latest technology .
oh .
that is so beautiful .
you got to take a look at this , ok ?
yeah .
you' re going to love it .
you have more ?
i have more .
believe me , i have more .
ha ha ha .
hey !
careful on the jacket .
it' s armani .
are you angry ?
i told you no wirehead shit in my car .
you' re on foot !
in l. a. ?
are you crazy ?
can i come in ?
i' m having a hard time hearing the stereo !
i need my case .
it' s still in the back .
can we talk a little bit like two rational adults ?
can we talk a little bit like two rational adults ?
uhh !
that' d be no .
ok, you got my attention .
this is cutting off the circulation to my head .
do you mind ?
macey .
it' s cool .
it' s nothing .
two seconds .
this is uncharacteristic , miss ice water in her veins .
you push me too far !
you made me lose it infront of a client !
i could get fired !
are we still friends ?
i don' t know .
friendship is more than one person ... constantly doing favors for an other .
i don' t hustle my friends .
but you just suck people along with scams and your slick act .
we' re still buddies ?
don' t use the time that i' m talking ... to think about what you' il say next .
you listening ?
yeah .
lenny, your ass is always broke , you go from score to score ... and you' re getting strung out .
you don' t even see it .
it' s your brain , so do whatever you want with it .
but not on my watch , you understand me ?
i got a child , i got rent ... and an ex husband doing hard time ... who doesn' t send me a dime of support .
i' m just trying to hold on here .
i know you wouldn' t say this if you didn' t care about me .
thanks , mace .
really .
you' re getting out with fumitsu , and that' s the end .
i' il get you to the templars in ten minutes .
i' m sorry for the inconvenience .
i' m changing my plans .
your supervisor has recommended an excellent club ... called the retinal fetish .
it' s on la cienega .
yes , sir .
enjoy your evening , mr. fumitsu .
i appreciate it .
thank you .
ok , come on .
excuse us .
excuse us .
excuse us .
hi , lenny .
this is a friend of mine , mr. fumitsu .
can you take care of him ?
he' s clean .
he' s fine .
could you take care of this gentleman ?
thank you .
ok .
bye .
hey , lenny .
how ya doing ?
who' s the new side of beef in gant' s posse ?
wade beemer , running back for the rams , ' 96 , ' 97 .
like a fucking freighttrain .
rams .
that' s football , right ?
no , ping pong .
iris was looking for you !
hello , lenny .
it' s ok, wade .
he' s an old friend of mine .
lenny nero .
come to peddle me some clips for old time' s sake ... or just making a few extra bucks for the holidays ?
you' re not a client anymore .
i wouldn' t sell you the sweat off a dead dog' s balls .
i' ve got everything i need from you .
thanks .
cut it out , philo .
too bad about your guy jeriko .
you' ve lost your golden goose .
show some respect .
he was an important artist .
important for your label , so you' re in mourning .
his records will sell out now , and you' il make out .
always do .
faith , can i talk to you for one second ?
it' s not a good idea right now .
i just gotta talk to you for one second .
about what ?
that' d be between me and faith .
funny , i don' t feel anything between you and faith .
you see , that' s your problem , lenny ... you assume too much .
you assume there' s something where there' s nothing .
you assume that you have a life ... when , infact, you peddle pieces of other people' s lives ... and the broken parts of your own .
faith .
get him to his car .
call me , ok ?
faith !
call me !
lenny the loser .
leave him alone , philo , ok ?
you shouldn' t talk to him or anybody ... not with everything that' s going on .
you are too goddamn paranoid .
you know that , philo ?
paranoia' s just ... reality on afiner scale .
thank you .
awoo !
ow !
ow !
ow !
ow !
hey .
what' s up, tex ?
what' s up , my brother ?
those rascals still haven' t grown back ?
no .

lenny, you have to leave .
i mean it .
iris said you were in trouble .
you talked to lris ?
when ?
tonight .
i haven' t seen her in months .
what the fuck would she know ?
who knows what' s going on in that whore' s head ?
she used to be your best friend .
you' re really running out of excuses ... to come around , aren' t you ?
i know you , faith .
you' re afraid of something .
what' s going on ?
just let it alone , lenny .
it' il take care of itself .
it' s gant , isn' t it ?
this guy is poison .
he' s got you walled in .
he uses the wire too much .
he gets off on tape , not on you .
that' s a good one coming from you .
why don' t you just split ?
i don' t want to .
do you love him ?
i don' t think so .
to him, you' re some kind of possession .
you' re like a ferrari .
you' re just something to show the other guys .
yeah ?
he has his uses, too, you know .
what ?
he gonna record you on his label ?
he might .
you never know , right ?
faith ...
faith , listen to me .
i' ve watched you create yourself out of nothing .
you' re like a goddamn cruise missile ... targeted on making it , and you will .
i know i will .
it' s you up on that stage , not him .
you don' t need him .
you have to get out of here .
if philo catches you , he' s gonna hurt you .
i' m already hurting .
no , i' m serious .
he' s acting crazy .
he' s doing way too much playback .
he' s gotten completely paranoid .
he' s such a controlfreak now ... he' s even paying max to follow me around .
max ?
you' re kidding .
yeah, for about a month now .
jesus .
look , lenny , just stay away from philo ... and stay away from me .
stop trying to rescue me .
those days are over .
i' m a big girl now .
i' ve changed .
stop trying to save me .
i don' t need saving .
just give up on me !
i just wanted to make sure you were all right .
you know why movies are still better than playback ?
' cause the music comes up , there' s credits ... and you always know when it' s over .
it' s over !
you were great .
hey , man .
i know what you' re thinking .
she told me about your new gig .
it' s just a job .
i feel like shit about it .
you should feel like shit .
i do .
you introduced me to that prick gant .
i introduced him to faith, too .
i don' t cherish the moment .
questionable move , given the historical perspective .
i figured i could take the prick' s money you wouldn' t believe what i' m charging him and make sure faith is ok atthe same time .
keep an eye on her .
for you , ok ?
which you can' t do ... without getting your fingers bent the wrong way back .
i need the money .
this does us both some good .
fairly twisted logic , max , even for you .
hey, you got a job .
i got a job .
ok .
i' m sorry .
you got a job .
that' s great .
listen, you got to stay on her .
watch her for me , please .
i' m on her .
ok .
stay cool .
take it easy , all right ?
you, too .
come on .
here , chicky , chicky , chicky ...
wait a minute .
i recognize you .
you' re wade beemer , right ?
running back for the rams , ' 96 , ' 97 , right ?
yeah .
that' s right .
i saw you play , man .
i mean, you were good .
i mean , like a fuckin ' freighttrain .
so, what happened ?
injuries or what ?
bullshit politics , man .
it' s always politics .
like this thing we' re in here .
he' s paying you to tune me up .
i' il pay you more not to .
i' il write a check right now .
i got to go .
ok .
cash !
here' s everything i have on me .
what do you say ?
how about a rolex ?
i got a real one .
come on .
it won' t hurt too bad .
it' s nothing personal .
just one second , please .
it' s my jacket .
it' s really expensive .
and just not not the eyes .
you' re bleeding .
some jerk puked on the stairs , and i slipped .
i should sue .
you came back for me .
i came back to pick up my client .
no .
you came back for me .
i got to lie down , macey , please , in the back ?
some piece of work , lenny nero .
you' re calmly back stroking along in the big toilet bowl ... and somehow , you never let it touch you .
i mean , between working vice ... and your current so called occupation ... you must have seen every kind of perversion .
but you' re just like some teflon man .
you still come out this ... goofball romantic .
it' s my sword and my shield , macey .
all right .
a little b & e action .
what did you say ?
nothing .
aah !
shit .
no , no .
please .
please .
please .
you can let me go , please .
i haven' t seen yourface .
please .
let me go .
let me go , please .
oh , my ... holy ...
aah !
lenny .
lenny !

go !
go !
oh , christ .
he' s jacking her into his own output .
she' s seeing what he' s seeing .
she' s she' s seeing herself !
aah !
no ...
oh ...
oh , my god .
god !
uhh !
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
lenny, what is it ?
a black jack .
black jack ?
a snuff clip .
it was lris .
the sickfucker killed her .
are you sure it' s real ?
oh , shit .
well , i lost my appetite ... for about a year .
want to take a look ?
hell , no .
i don' t fool with that .
you all right ?
yeah .
you ok ?
no .
not really .
here .
all right .
let' s work it .
no , i i can' t .
come on , lenny, you used to be good at this shit .
let' s play it down .
what' s the perp doing ?
i can' t .
you used to be a fuckin ' cop , ok ?
that is a fucking murder .
what' s he doing ?
he stalks her ... and ... he rapes her ... and he does her .
and he records it .
he' s a thrill killer .
he wants to see it again .
he records himself raping and killing her .
but he sends a signal to her .
so she feels what he feels while he' s inside her .
the thrill while he' s killing her ... sent to her ... heightening her fear ... which heightens the turn onfor him .
i' ve seen a lot .
so have i. too much .
it' s a bad one .
yeah .
he makes her see her own death , feeds off the reaction .
he records it all .
everything .
and gives it to you .
he wants to share it .
of course he wants to share , man .
that' s his deal .
he needs an audience .
this is a sick puppy .
why me ?
' cause you' re the magic man , lenny .
you make dreams happen , don' t you ?
if it' s got something to do with the wire ... sooner or later , it washes up on your beach .
i' ve never dealt in black jacks .
everybody knows that .
he' s just skull fucking you .
he just wants a reaction from you .
he wants to make you do something you do not want to do .
maybe he just figures lenny will appreciate it .
it' s the dark end of the street .
how do you like it now ?
jesus , mace , back off .
no .
this guy' s one of your squld head contacts .
he' s somebody that you know .
the problem with that is lenny knows everybody .
take the tape to the cops .
no .
no .
they' il crucify me .
so this wire freak gets to keep running around , huh ?
lenny' s right .
the police will think he' s the perp ... or they' il go through his client list and ruin his life ... such as it is .
i' il call my buddies at homicide .
i' il tell them lris was a friend of mine ... and that' il put me in the loop .
i' il get the forensics and all that shit .
get some sleep .
i' il call you when i get something .
relax !
lenny !
keep moving , man .
somebody' s thinking about you a whole lot .
leave me alone .
don' t come to my house .
are you trying to ruin my life ?
iris is dead .
she was murdered .
who did it ?
i don' t know , but this guy' s real damaged goods .
iris knew someone was after her .
she said you were in danger, too .
i' m not in any danger .
no more games .
whatever you' re hiding , whatever' s going on ... you have to get out of here now .
then what ?
are you gonna protect me ?
are you a big tough guy ?
you' re a fucking talker .
you don' t even own a gun .
i have a gun .
it' s under my bed .
you don' t know whatyou' re fucking with .
tell me .
tell him , faith .
go on .
lenny just stopped by to give me some bad news .
an oldfriend of mine' s been murdered .
remember lris ?
how the fuck did you get up here ?
charm .
tell you what , lenny .
just for you , hmm ?
make you a deal .
why don' t you just take her ?
if she' s so unhappy and wants to leave , she can go .
i' il let her decide .
faith always knows what she wants .
don' t you , baby ?
see ?
hands off .
i' il tell you something else .
i' il tell you this, you fuck .
if she says she stays, you go .
you crawl back in your cockroach hole ... and you never cross my vision again .
faith ...
come on .
come on .
i' ve made my choice , lenny .
get him out .
get him out !
you' re fucking crazy , faith !
come with me !
faith !
i don' t love you anymore !
do you understand that ?
you mean nothing to me !
leave me alone , lenny , please .
you said you were gonna get lris out of this .
now you understand the danger we' re in .
that was so sweet what you said out there .
so touching .
i almost believed it .
i don' t think he understands you did it for him .
he doesn' t even know what' s going on .
leave him alone !
i' d leave him alone if he' d stop coming around ... and you would just stop talking to him !
the only time a whore should open her mouth ... is when she' s giving head .
shit !
mace !
help !
shit !
mace !
help !
don' t be shy , lenny .
this is yourfloor .
let' s go .
lenny , guess who' s going to the hospital ?
can we be smart here ?
i can make itworth yourwhile .
i' m not saying i mind a couple of shots .
just go light is all i' m saying .

that one had to hurt .
safety' s on .
uhh !
come on .
let' s go .
hey, wait !
ohh !
that' sfucked up .
i need a drink .
get some rest .
the cops know they' il never nail this guy ... the second they walk in the room .
it' s all about whatthey see walking in dead hooker , handcuffs , penetration .
cops are lazy .
they know nobody gives a shit about a dead hooker .
they' re road kill , right ?
they' il take some pictures , make some jokes ... and just shrug it off like it' s a random kill .
it' s a trick gone wrong .
it' s the kind you never solve .
that doesn' t add , does it ?
because lris said she knew somebody was after her .
that is not random .
if they get me [ siren ]
she said " they .
if they get me .
this whole random sex killerthing is bullshit .
somebody whacked her for a reason .
so this guy' s not a psycho ?
no , he' s a psycho .
to do what' s on thattape ... he' s not a well adjusted human being .
i gotta get some sleep .
ok , lenny .
putthat down ... and i' il check on you tomorrow .
hey, you wantto rub my neck ?
my shoulder' s real sore .
ok .
all right .
come here .

oh, yeah .

that guy isfucked up .
we know that .
no .
the killer' s got some kind of distortion ... in the visual cortex .
the color and gray scale values are all messed up .
like color blindness .
see the peak period ratios ?
there could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion .
whoever' s doing this is using a box to splitthe signal
you ever make a box like that ?
yeah , but i can' t see the gear well enough to see if it' s mine .
i don' t like this .
this is not good .
what ?
it' s cutting close to me .
she was just here , man .
who was ?
iris !
pay attention !
iris was here ?
the other night , shaking like a junkie ... saying she wanted me to copy some clip .
whatwas it ?
she wouldn' t let me see .
she was going to give it to you to holdfor her ...
iike insurance or something .
she never gave me a tape .
think backto what she said .
she came in crying .
she wanted to go to my car .

that' s right , and you gonna be in my next song .
it' s gonna be called " robo steckler .
it' s all about a cop who met his worst nightmare ... a nigger with enough political juice ... to scrunch his ass like a stink bug .

peoplefinding out ... seeing ... thatthe lapd justflat out executed jeriko one .
jesus .
jesus .
maybe they oughtto see .
maybe ... buttonight' s probably notthe best night .
mace .
come on .
we' re rolling .
i don' tthink those cops did lris .
whoever lris was wearingfor killed her .
why ?
lenny : lf those cops had gotten hold of her ... they' d have beat it out of her who she was wearingfor ... and gone afterthem, too .
our killer is running as scared as we are ... which makes him really dangerous ... judging by how scared i am .
hold it up .
let her go .
sounds like tick' s already celebrating .
you seem overdressed forthis party .
i wanted to look niceforyou .
hey, tick , i gotto talkto you .
shit !
he' s been cooked off .
mace : ls he dead ?
no , but hisfrontal lobes are like two runny eggs .
they put an amplifier in line to boostthe signal ... and itfries his brain .
tick !
it' s lenny !
hey , hey, tick , come on !
tick , it' s me .
lenny .
come on .
wake up !
tick !
come on !
come on, tick , come on !
he' s totally cut off from the outside world .
how long does it last ?
forever .
those two psycho cops are on a slash and burn ... tofind the tape and covertheirtracks .
tick is a known duplicator .
they wanttofind outwhat he knows , if copies were made ... orwho might' ve wired up lris .
it doesn' t even get investigated as a homicide ... since he' s technically alive . since he' s technically alive .
yeah .
that' s right .
he' s technically alive .
seems sophisticatedforthem .
these are not subtle guys .
there' s more to this than you think .
what do you mean ?
all i' m saying is ... you don' t know how high up thefood chain this thing goes .
i heard stuff .
what stuff ?
i heard stuff , smoke , rumors .
i' ve heard stuff .
i' ve heard stuff about a death squad .
they' re a group of guys , cops , loyal to the hard line school .
guys who' ve had too many years of city hall , review boards ... and the goddamn media pissing down their necks ... suspending cops right and left , tying their hands ... while these same people are squealing ...
save us !
save us !
do something, you morons .
crime is totally out of control .
bullshit , max .
it' s conspiracy paranoia .
the issue isn' twhether you' re paranoid .
the issue is whether you' re paranoid enough .
christ .
exactly .
get religion , man .
i love you like my own blood , lenny ... but don' twalk near me in public right now , ok ?
the only card we gotto play is the tape .
get itto the media .
that' s right .
blow it open .
run that on the eleven o' clock news ... by midnight, you' ve got the biggest riot in history .
they' il see the smoke in canada .
whatthe hell are you saying pretend it didn' t happen ?
i didn' t say that .
it happened .
the lapd executed ... one of the most important black men in america .
who thefuck are you to try to bury it ?
trying to rake the lapd over a cheese grater ?
you want blood running in the storm drains , go do it .
two hundred thousand gangbangers will spread through this city ... and burn it to thefucking ground , mace .
once thefire starts ... the cops will cap off anything that moves .
it' il be an all outwar .
i don' tthink so .
maybe it' s timefor a war .
you really wantthat on your head , mace , huh ?
really ?
whoever did lris did tick .
it' s the same sick wirehead shit .
it' s the same reason to burn the trail .
if faith knows anything aboutthis , and she does
somebody' s going to kill faith ?
yeah, you' re not rid of me
no, you' re not rid of me
i' il make you lick my injuries
i' m gonna twistyour head off , see ?

he' s a total wiretripjunkie .
he' s such a controlfreak , he' s been having peoplefollowed .
he' s recording his business partners ' phone calls .
he' s wiring up people left and right .
philo and jeriko weren' t getting along .
he was afraid jeriko was gonna dump him ... but he wasn' t sure , so he starts with the surveillance .
a couple of nights ago , he wires up lris ... and he sends her and the other girl , diamanda ... overto jeriko' s table .
hi , baby .
hi .
my name is lris .
hey .
i got a presentforyou .
you are so beautiful .
so that night , lris calls up crying .
she' sfreaking out .
she comes over , and she plays the tape .
philo loses it .
he can' t believe the disaster she' s gotten him into .
he' s afraid the cops will beat it out of her ... who she' s been workingfor and then come lookingfor him .
why didn' t he just go public with the tape ?
save himself thatway ?
falth : lf it got out he spied on his own artists ... he' d lose all his other acts , and it' d be overfor him .
shh .
so he gives lris some money .
he tells herto check into a hotel under an assumed name ... until he canfigure out whatto do .
hefigured outwhatto do .
you think he killed her ?
the killer knew where she was because he put herthere .
what a nightmare .
i don' t know where thefuck she is , butwe' re late .
let' s go .
philo , how do you want me to work it atthe bonaventure ?

no problem .

see you upthere in a bit , helpyou ring in the new year .
i liveforthe moment .
pussy whipped , sorry ass motherfucker .
oww !
take it easy .
where are they now ?
he' s got her up in the room , under guard .
he' s still working the party ... acting smooth like nothing' s nothing .
i say we work a trade .
what do you mean ?
give him the clip .
it' sfucking brilliant .
the tapefor faith .
i know he' il gofor it , and i can set it up .
this is whatwe laughingly referto as a plan , right ?
just getyour butt down here .
if i' m not downstairs , go to the room .
it' s twenty two oh three .
you writing ?
two two zero three .
if he gives us any shit ... we kill them all .
what do you say ?
really scatterthe pigeons .
we gotto get overthere .
can you borrow a dress from cecile or something ?
i' m not going .
gant' s going to do her rightthere .
shut up .
lenny , parkyour mouth and listen .
it' s a setup .
think about it .
why' s he sending tapes to you ?
to getyou to rush in ... put a bullet in you , one in her , and the gun in your hand .
yeah, that sounds right .
i' m going .
you gonna getyourself killedforthis ?
forthis toxic waste bitch ?
whatthefuck are you doing ?
this is your life !
right here !
right now !
it' s real time, you hear me ?
real time !
time to get real , not playback .
you understand me ?
she doesn' t love you anymore .
maybe she did once , but she doesn' t now .
these are used emotions .
it' s time to trade them in .
memories were meanttofade .
they' re designed thatway for a reason .
have you ever been in love with ... someone who didn' t return that love ?
yeah , lenny ...
i have .
didn' t stopyou from loving them , right ?
or being able to understand them ... orforgive them ?
i guess .
didn' t stopyou from wanting to protectthem ... did it ?
when i met faith , she was just another ... another runaway ... giving twenty dollar blow jobs to buy crank .
just another lost soul .
and she had this voice thatwas ...
well , itwas scary .
like she could take all the hurt and rage ... of the entire world ... and lift it upto heaven in one voice .
i helped her .
and i promised herthat i' il always just be there ... to protect her .
see , it' s not about what' s in her head .
it' s aboutwhat' s in mine .
i can' t let go of the promise .
it' s like it' s all i have left .
no , it' s not .
come on .
let' s go to a party .
the end of the world, yeah !
shit !
let' s bail .
hey , mace .
you look great in that dress .
i mean , betterthan i would .
thankyou , i think .
come on , let' s go .
hold it rightthere !
what' s your plan ... for getting into the most sold out party in history ?
relax , mace .
this is what i do .
you see gant ?
uh uh .
oh , shit .
come on , max .
come on , buddy .
come on , buddy .
the customeryou have called is unavailable ... or has traveled
all right .
i still got one ace to play .
gant' s gotwhat i want .
i' ve gotwhat he wants .
this is the original .
there are no copies .
that' s why it' s a makeable deal .
this tape is a lightning bolt from god .
it' s worth more than you , more than me ... and more than faith .
you understand ?
it can change things that need changing ... before we all go off the end of the road .
you do not have the right to use itfor currency .
so if you go ... you go alone .
i care aboutyou , lenny ... a lot more than you know ... which makes us both pretty stupid , huh ?
but if you pawn this tape ... you mean nothing to me .
excuse me .
excuse me .
you see that guy overthere ?
that' s deputy commissioner palmer strickland ... the sanctimonious prick who busted me out .
his ass is so tight ... when hefarts only dogs can hear it .
if there' s one cop who' s not dirty , it' s him .
take itto him .
you want me to trust a cop ?
no .
trust me .
here .
what if you' re wrong ?
go .
excuse me .
commissioner ... there' s a clip in here thatyou need to see right now .
if itweren' t new year' s eve , i' d have you arrested ... for possession of illegal equipment .
just look atthe clip .
you wantto know who killed jeriko ... go into that stall right now and hit " play .
cop : ls there a problem ?
damn it , i knew it .
let' s go .
let go of me !
sir ?
wade , can we talk here like two human beings ?
it' s nothing personal .
remember me, youfucking bitch ?
come on !
come on !
what are you looking at ?
god damn it !
enjoy the party .
steckler ... steckler !

i can' t believe this is happening .

don' t make any assumptions about ourfriendship , lenny .
i didn' t know you were color blind , max .
only way i could stand yourties .
manos arriba , amigo .
ooh .
glocktwenty three .
nice .
where' s faith ?
i sent herto the party .
ifigured i' d wait up here until you killed gant .
what makes you think i' m gonna kill gant ?
you just did .
jesus !
statistically, that' s the second most common word people say ... right before they die ...
shit " being number one .
so , uh ...
i killed gant , then you ran in ... and being on his payroll , you shot me .
that' s the way it happened .
now i' m remembering .
i killed lris, too , didn' t l ?
they' ilfind the original of her snuff clip ... in your apartment .
the one i left atthe club was a copy .
was i a really busy guy ?
did i do tick, too ?
you bet .
did you like it ?
so, why , max ?
why did you have to do lris ?
ifeel like i gotta share this with somebody ...
' cause it' s justtoo perfect .
i won' t say anything .
oh , i know .
so , i' m working forthis puke , right ?
and he says he' il pay me quite large to do the hooker ... but i also gotto do his bitch girlfriend ...
' cause she knows the score , and she' s out of control .
only he doesn' t know about me and faith .
so i say to myself , if i turn the job down ... he' il get somebody else , and i lose faith ... to coin a phrase .
to buy time , i do the skank ... but i still got to deal with gant .
it' s him or me ... but i can' t cap him without some chump ... to take thefall .
and who better ... than his girlfriend' s loser ex boyfriend known criminal ... and who has been seen hassling them in public ?
who is , regrettably , also your bestfuckingfriend .
no plan is perfect , lenny .
cheer up .
the world' s ending in ten minutes , anyway .
you must be so pleased .
i mean , lfollowed your jellybean trail right here ...
iike a good little chump .
you gotfoggy on me a couple times .
rememberthat riff aboutthe death squad ?
i had to keepyou from going to the cops .
i' ve heard stuff about a death squad .
the issue isn' twhether you' re paranoid , lenny .
the issue' s whether you' re paranoid enough .
there neverwas a death squad ?
no .
justtwo loose cannon cops covering their butts .
pretty zany , huh ?
all this caused by a random traffic stop .
nothing means nothing , man .
you know that .
the whole planet' s in totalfucking chaos .
the day of reckoning is upon us !
you gotta getwhatyou can while you can ...
' cause some shitbird can come put a twenty two ... in the back of your head ... any second .
aah !
how' d you hook upwith faith ?
hmm ...
thisfuck hires me about a month ago to eyeball her ... only faith knows mefrom you .
so she comes upto me and says , " max, why are youfollowing me ?
and i say , " i' il buy you a drink .
i' il explain .
and she says
do you enjoy watching me ?
you' re supposed to go downstairs , baby .
i know .
i don' t always do what i' m told .
you know that .
so i said , " do you enjoy watching me ?
come on , max .
play with me .
and then what' d you say ?
i said , " yeah , i' d even do itforfree .
uh huh .
and i said , " that' s good ...
because i like thefeeling of someone watching me .
i acquired the taste from lenny .
and then she said ...
since we' re going to spend so much time together ...
why don' twe make the best of it ?
the very best .
you know all aboutthat , don' tyou , lenny ?
faith and me , wefound a place ... you could never reach , max .
