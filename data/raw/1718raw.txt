titi ...
that' s titi !
i work , say ... for the government .
we' ve decided to give you another chance .
what do i do ?
learn .
learn to read , walk , talk , smile and even fight .
learn to do everything .
what for ?
to serve your country .
what if i don' t want to ?
row 8 , plot 30 .
can i sleep a bit before i decide ?
i' il be back in an hour .
motherfucker !
where' s the way out ?
straight ahead .
who' re these shits ?
employees .
nobody move !
it' s ok !
the hell it is !
nothing' s ok !
open the door !
i can' t open it .
tell them to open the door !
they won' t .
i' il blow your brains out .
it' s not loaded .
forget it .
get off me !
cool it .
right , get back to your desks .
rule 1 , the first bullet' s not for you .
that' il clip your wings .
made your mind up ?
that' s good .
fill that out .
if i don' t make it ?
you' il make it .
we' il start with an easy program .
it' s like a typewriter keyboard letters and figures .
that' s the mouse .
there' s a roller under it to move the arrow .
if you press here , you can make drawings .
go on then .
there .
gently .
that' s good .
gently .
gently !
bring the arrow back now .
back up to the corner .
bring the arrow back here .

these are the firearms we use .
first , the simplest of all ... the beretta 93r , 9mm automatic , 20 shots maximum .
the barrel towards the target .
before learning the correct stance , get to know the tool .
target at 10 m .
used one before ?
never on paper .
nice and round .

my leg hurts .
never mind .
we' il try a reflex exercise .
an easy one .
get ready .
now i' ve taken up my guard .
i want you to try to hit my face .
next class .
sit down there .
my dear girl ... you don' t look much now chewing gum ... but if we work hard together and if fortune smiles on us ... we' il be able to make you into a human being .
an intermediary but necessary step ... before becoming man' s perfect complement ... a woman .
do you like it ?
can you give me a definition of grace ?
i' m not smart .
smile then .
that' il be a good start .
smile when you don' t know something .
you won' t be any smarter but it' s nice for others .
allow yourself to be taken over by the faint fragility ... which will make your face beautiful .
a smile .
a smile ... is surface sweetness .
gentleness .
almost a mood .
shall we fix the wig ?
how' s it going ?
i wish it had gone .
a sense of humor .
that' s a good start .
made friends ?
i get on well with my mouse .
when do we go for a drink ?
not just yet .
no rest in this factory ?
never .
that suits you .
i' m going to be 20 next week .

how' s it going ?
i' ve a great program to try out .

i' il give you 2 weeks .
after that , she' s out .
who are you ?
i don' t know .
but ...
you are ...
yes ...
what are you doing in my arms ?
i don' t know .
but now we' ve got this far ...
maybe it' s just a dream .
oh my darling .
you' ve made progress , especially in dance .
in art too .
but in all the other subjects ...
nix , zilch ... zero .
i' il be right back .
happy birthday .
blow them out .
they' ve given us 2 weeks .
i can' t do any more after .
not a thing .
are you looking at my hands ?
they were beautiful once .
now , they give me away .
did you go through this ?
let your pleasure be your guide .
your pleasure as a woman .
and don' t forget ...
there are two things that have no limit : femininity and the means of taking advantage of it .
i don' t believe it !
not ready yet ?
you' re uptight , amande .
it' s five to and i hate unpunctuality .
waiting sharpens the appetite .
