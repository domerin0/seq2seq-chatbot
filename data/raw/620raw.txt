she' s got your number .
i wanted to write a poem for all of them , but i didn' t have time .

something you want more than anything .

father found some pipe tobacco in the pocket of his coat , and we made them .
rather , father did .
look at that .

there' s a little fluff in it , but not much .

that' s right .
you wouldn' t want to sell that , mrs. frank , would you ?
never .
this is the most precious gift i' ve ever had .
for father .
annele , i wasn' t supposed to have a present .
look at that .
it' s a muffler .
oh , i know .
to wear around your neck like an ascot , you know .
i knitted it in the dark each night .
i' m afraid it looks better in the dark .

thank you , anne .
for mouschi .
he' il like it .

aren' t you going to open it ?
come on , show us what it is .
it' s a safety razor .
what ?
it' s not new .
miep got it , secondhand .
but you really do need a razor now .
what for ?
look at his upper lip .
see ?
he wants to get rid of that ?
put some milk on it and let the cat lick it off .
you think you' re funny , don' t you ?
look , he can' t wait .
he' s going in to try it now .
i' m going to give mouschi his present .
mouschi , mouschi , mouschi .
enough !
and last , but never least , my roommate , mr. dussel .
something for me ?
capsules .
they' re earplugs .
to put in your ears so you won' t hear me when i thrash around at night .
i made them myself .

that' s a real hannukah .
lsn' t she cute ?
a real hannukah .
now let' s sing the song , father .
wait till you hear the hannukah song , mr. dussel .
annele .
i' m afraid we shouldn' t sing the song .
it' s a song of jubilation and of rejoicing .
one is apt to become too enthusiastic about it .
please , let' s sing it .
i promise not to shout .
very well , but quietly , annie .
i' il keep my eye on you .
if you get
oh .
oh !
i told you not to come in with that cat .
get out of here !
what' s the matter with you ?
haven' t you any sense ?
get that cat out of here .
cat ?
you heard me , get it out of here !
i have no cat .
mr. dussel .
it doesn' t have to be the cat .
just the hairs on his clothing ... ... from the cat is enough when he comes in the room .
you won' t be bothered anymore .
we' re getting rid of it .
at last , you listen to me .
and i' m not doing it for you .
that' s all in your mind , all of it .
i' m doing it because i' m sick of seeing that cat eat all our food .
that' s not true .
i only give him scraps .
don' t tell me .
he gets fatter every day .
damn cat looks better than any of us .
out he goes tonight .
no !
mr. van daan , you can' t do that .
that' s peter' s cat .
peter loves that cat .
annie .
if he goes , i go .
go .
go .
he' s not going and the cat' s not going .
what' s wrong with you ?
it' s hannukah .
look , please , annie , sing .
annele .
annele .
i think we should first blow out the candles .
then we' il have something for tomorrow night .
father , you' re supposed to let it burn itself out .
i' m sure that god understands shortages .
praised be thou , lord , who has permitted us ... ... to celebrate this joyous festival .
amen .
amen .
amen .
i think they' ve gone .
they' ve found us .
if they had , they would be up here by now .
i know it was the green police .
they' ve gone to get help .
maybe the gestapo looking for papers .
or another thief looking for money .
i' m going down .
they may still be there .
annele , this is saturday .
we won' t know what happened until miep or mr. kraler come here on monday .
we cannot live with this uncertainty .
now , please .
please .
get our money .
they say you can buy them off .
quick , go get the money .
keep still !
you want to be dragged off to a concentration camp ?
you gonna stand there till they come get you ?
will you keep still ?
someone go and make father come back .
haven' t you done enough ?
please , mr. van daan .
annie !
i lift up mine eyes unto the mountains , from whence cometh my help .
my help cometh from the lord , who made heaven and earth .
he that keepeth thee will not slumber .
he that keepeth lsrael doth neither slumber nor sleep .
the lord is thy keeper .
the lord is thy shade upon thy right hand .
over here .
i better go and look and make sure .
yeah .
the lord shall keep thee from all evil .
he shall keep thy soul .
hear me , o , lsrael .
the lord shall guide thy going out and thy coming in .
took the typewriter and ran away .
he didn' t shut the street door .
it was swinging wide open .
the watchman was passing .
we had a burglar .
he got out as he heard me coming .
i will lock the door and report it .
they' ve gone and locked the door .
oh , thank god , they' ve gone .
i' d just as soon they take us than to continue with this agony .
i can' t think .
it' s all right .
the danger has passed .
who says the danger has passed ?
don' t you realize that we' re in greater danger than ever ?
please , will you keep still ?
thanks to this clumsy fool , someone now knows we' re up here .
someone knows we' re hiding .
it' s a thief !
you think ... ... he' il go to the green police and say , " i was robbing a place ... ... and i heard a noise above my head " ?
would he do that ?
i think he will .
you' re crazy .
i think that someday that the thief will be caught ... ... and he' il make a bargain with the gestapo .
he' il say to the gestapo , " lf you let me off ... ... i' il show you where some jews are hiding .
that' s what i think .
oh .
he' s right .
oh , mother , let' s get out of here .
we can' t stay here now .
please , let' s go .
go ?
where ?
yes , where ?
have we lost all faith ?
all courage ?
a few moments ago , we thought they had come for us , didn' t we ?
we thought it was the end .
well , it wasn' t the end .
we' re alive .
we' re safe .
we thank thee , o , lord , our god , that in thy infinite mercy ... ... thou hast again seen fit to spare us .
amen .
amen .
annele .
the song .
how about the song ?
happy hannukah .
happy hannukah .
saturday , the 1st of january , 1944 .
another new year has begun ... ... and we find ourselves still in our hiding place .
we have been here now ... ... for one year , five months and 25 days .
one of our family has left us .
mouschi ran away .
we ' re all a little thinner .
the van daans ' discussions are as violent as ever .
mother still doesn ' t understand me .
but then , i don ' t understand her either .
there is one great change , however ... ... a change in myself .
i read somewhere that girls of my age don ' t feel quite certain of themselves .
that they become quiet within ... ... and begin to think of the miracle that is taking place in their bodies .
i think that what is happening to me is so wonderful .
not only what can be seen ... ... but what is taking place inside .
each time it has happened , i feel i have a sweet secret ... ... and i long for the time when i shall feel that secret within me again .
annele !
peter !
a wonderful surprise , mr. kraler and miep are here .
thank you .
you shouldn' t have come .
you should have at least one day to yourselves .
don' t say that .
it' s so wonderful to see them .
what is it ?
what is it ?
mr. kraler .
happy new year , mr. dussel .
happy new year .
how are you , margot ?
feeling any better ?
i' m all right .
we filled her full of every kind of pill ... ... so she won' t cough and make a noise .
look what miep has brought us .
a cake !
ooh .
a cake .
well .
i' il get some plates .
thank you , miep .
thank you .
you must have used all of your sugar rations for weeks .
it' s beautiful , isn' t it ?
it' s ages since i' ve even seen a cake .
not since you brought the one last year .
remember ?
it had " peace in 1 943 " written on it .
peace in 1 944 .
peace has to come sometime , you know .
here you are , liefje .
now ...
... how many of us are there ?
none for me .
oh , you must .
please , miep .
good .
that leaves one , two , three ....
seven of us .
eight .
the same as it always is .
i left margot out .
i take it for granted margot won' t eat .
why wouldn' t she ?
i think it won' t harm her .
all right , all right .
i just didn' t want her to start coughing again , that' s all .
and please , mrs. frank should cut the cake .
what do you mean ?
well , mrs. frank divides things better .
just what are you trying to say ?
forget it , we' re wasting time .
don' t i always give everybody exactly the same ?
don' t l ?
forget it .
no , i want an answer .
don' t l ?
yes , yes , yes .
everybody gets exactly the same ... ... except mr. van daan gets a little bit more .
that' s a lie !
she always cuts the same
mr. van daan , please .
you see , miep , what a little sugar cake does to us ?
it goes right to our heads .
here you are , mrs. frank .
thank you .
you' re sure you won' t have any ?
very sure .
miep .
no , thank you , really .
cut the cake .
thank you .
that' s yours , peter .
maybe mouschi went back to our house .
you ever get over there ?
do you think that you could ?
i' m afraid with him gone a week , peter ....
make up your mind .
already someone has had a big nice meal from that cat .
it' s delicious , miep .
delicious .
well , i must run .
there' s a party tonight .
how heavenly !
remember what everyone' s wearing ... ... and what you eat and everything so you can tell us .
i' il give you a full report .
goodbye , everyone .
goodbye , miep .
just a minute .
there' s something i' d like you to do for me .
where are you going ?
what are you going to do ?
no .
don' t you dare take that coat .
what is wrong ?
father is going to sell her fur coat .
she' s crazy about that old fur coat .
it' s mine , you hear me ?
my father gave me that coat .
no !
you have no right !
is it possible that anyone can ... ... be silly enough to worry about a fur coat at a time like this ?
it' s none of your darn business .
peter .
just ... ... a little discussion on the advisability of selling this coat .
as i have often reminded mrs. van daan ... ... it' s selfish of her to keep it when people outside ... ... are in desperate need of clothing .
so if you please , sell it for us ?
it should fetch a good price .
and by the way ... ... would you get me cigarettes ?
i don' t care what kind , get all you can .
it is very difficult to get them , mr. van daan , but i' il try .
goodbye .
goodbye .
mr. frank , could i talk to you ?
something' s happened , hasn' t it , mr. kraler ?
what' s happened ?
if it is something that concerns us here , we' d better all hear it .
the children  what they' d imagine ... ... would be worse than any reality .
it is a man in the storeroom .
his name is karl .
you knew him .
one day , he came to the office .
what do you hear from your friend mr. frank ?
i said there' s a rumor you were in switzerland .
he said he had heard that rumor too , but he thought i knew something more .
i did not pay much attention .
i tried to forget it .
and then yesterday , we were coming out of the storeroom , out there .
i had started down to the office .
i looked back .
he was standing , staring at the bookcase .
he said , " i thought i remembered a door up here .
was not there a door here leading to the loft ?
then he asked me for more money .
20 guilders more a week .
blackmail .
20 guilders ?
very modest blackmail .
that' s just the beginning .
you know what i think ?
he' s the thief who was down there that night .
that' s how he knows we' re here .
how was it left ?
what did you tell him ?
i told him i had to think about it .
what shall i do , pay him the money ?
take a chance on firing him , or what ?
i do not know .
for heaven sakes , don' t fire him .
pay him what he asks .
keep him here , where you can keep your eye on him .
is it much that he' s asking ?
what are they paying nowadays ?
he could get it in a war plant .
but this is not a war plant .
mind you , i do not know if he knows or not .
offer him half , then we' il soon know if it is blackmail or not .
and if it is ?
we' ve got to pay , haven' t we ?
whatever he asks , we' ve got to pay .
let us decide when the time comes .
this may be all my imagination .
you get to a point , these days ... ... where you suspect everyone and everything .
what does that mean , the telephone ringing on a holiday ?
that' s my wife .
i told her i had to go over some papers in my office ... ... to call me here when she got out of church .
goodbye .
happy new year .
goodbye .
goodbye , mr. kraler .
i will offer him half , then .
thank you , mr. kraler .
you can thank your son for this .
him and his damn cat !
that night , there .
i tell you , it' s just a question of time now .
sometimes i wish the end would come , whatever it is .
margot !
at least we' d know where we were .
you should be ashamed of yourself , talking that way .
think how lucky we are .
think of the thousands dying in the war every day .
think of the people in concentration camps .
what' s the good of that ?
what' s the good of thinking of misery when you' re already miserable ?
that' s stupid !
we' re young , margot and peter and l .
you grownups have had your chance .
but look at us .
if we begin thinking of all the horror in the world , we' re lost .
we' re trying to hold on to some kind of ideals when everything
ideals , hope , everything is being destroyed .
it isn' t our fault the world is in such a mess .
we weren' t around when this started .
you listen to me !
so don' t try to take it out on us !
she talks as if we started the war .
did we start the war ?
you left this .
thanks .
i thought you were fine just now .
you know how to talk to them .
i can' t think when i' m mad .
i say too much .
i hurt people' s feelings .
i think you' re just fine .
thank you , peter .
dussel , what he said about mouschi , about somebody eating him ... ... all i could think is i wanted to hit him .
that' s what i used to do at school .
but here a fight starts , i duck in my room .
you' re lucky , having a room to go to .
his lordship is always in mine .
when they start in on me , i have to stand and take it .
you gave some of it back to them just now .
i get so mad .
they' ve formed their opinions ... ... about everything .
but we' re still trying to find out .
we have problems here that no other people our age have ever had .
and just as you think you' ve solved them ... ... something comes along and bang !
you have to start all over again .
i think your father' s fine .
oh , he is , peter .
he is .
he' s the only one who' s ever given me the feeling that i have any sense .
isn' t it funny , you and l ?
here we' ve been together all this time ... ... and this is the first time we' ve ever really talked .
it helps a lot to have someone to talk to , doesn' t it ?
it helps you let off steam .
anytime that you want to let off steam ... ... you can come into my room .
i can get up an awful lot of steam .
it' s all right with me .
do you mean that ?
i said it , didn' t l ?
good night .
good night .
good night .
may i come in ?
no , i' m not dressed yet .
margot .
tell me , am i terribly ugly ?
oh , stop fishing .
no , tell me .
of course you' re not .
you' ve got nice eyes ... ... and a lot of animation and ....
may i come in ?
come in , mother .
mr. dussel is impatient to get in .
he takes the room all day .
you' re not going in again tonight to see peter ?
that is my intention .
aren' t you afraid you' re disturbing him ?
mother , i have some intuition .
then may i ask this much , annie ?
don' t shut the door when you go in .
you sound like mrs. van daan .
no , no .
i don' t mean to suggest anything is wrong .
i only wish you wouldn' t expose yourself to criticism .
i' m sorry , mother .
i' m going to peter' s room .
i' m not going to let petronella van daan spoil our friendship .
just a moment , mr. dussel .
in my day , the boys called on the girls .
you know how young people are .
peter' s room ...
... is the only place where they can talk .
talk ?
that' s not what they called it when i was a girl .
i' m sorry , margot , that you have to be the one left out .
i feel so guilty about you .
why ?
i mean , every time i go into peter' s room ... ... i have the feeling that i' m hurting you .
i know if it were me , i' d be desperately jealous .
i am jealous , a little , but not of you and peter .
i' m ....
i' m only feeling sorry that i haven' t anyone ... ... with whom to discuss my feelings .
margot , i won' t even  listen , you' ve found a companionship ... ... and i want you to enjoy it .
only , in my heart , i feel i' ve got a right to share feelings with someone too .
but i' m sure that peter , that that boy , he could never be that person for me .
maybe there' s nothing to be jealous about .
maybe i' m just taking the place of his cat .
will you please let me in my room ?
just a minute , dear mr. dussel .
well , here i go , to run the gauntlet .
thank you so much .
look at her .
a lot of good it did me to have a son .
i never see him .
just a minute , dear .
i' d like to say a few words to my son .
do you mind ?
peter , i do not want you staying up till all hours tonight .
you need sleep .
you' re a growing boy .
annie won' t stay late .
she' s going to bed promptly at 9 .
aren' t you , annie ?
yes , mother .
may we go now ?
listen for the chimes , dear .
aren' t they impossible ?
treating us as if we' re still in the nursery .
don' t let it bother you .
it doesn' t bother me .
i suppose you can' t really blame them .
they think back to what they were like at our age .
they don' t realize how much more advanced we are .
already i know what i want to do , don' t you ?
i want to be a journalist or something .
i love to write .
what do you want to do ?
i know what i' d like right now .
i' d like to go to england and get with the free dutch forces .
peter , you wouldn' t try a thing like that .
you' d never make it .
i' d make it .
only a few of the hundreds that try do .
i know , but i' d like to get in it and hit back .
to just sit here , it' s not for me .
you like margot , don' t you ?
right from the start , you liked her .
liked her better than me .
i don' t know .
it' s all right .
everyone feels that way .
margot' s so good .
she' s sweet and bright and beautiful , and i' m not .
i wouldn' t say that .
oh , no , i' m not .
i know that .
i know quite well that i' m not a beauty .
i never have been and never shall be .
i don' t agree at all .
i think you' re pretty .
that' s not true .
and another thing .
you' ve changed .
from the first , i mean .
i have ?
i used to think that you were awful noisy .
and what do you think now , peter ?
how have i changed ?
well ... ... you' re quieter .
i' m glad you don' t just hate me .
i never said that .
i bet when you get out of here , you' il never think of me again .
that' s crazy .
now , what did i ever see in that miss quack quack ?
i haven' t got any friends .
peter , of course you have .
everyone has friends .
not me .
i don' t want any .
i get along fine without them .
does that mean you can get along without me too ?
i think of myself as your friend .
no .
if they were all like you ... ... it' d be different .
peter ... ... did you ever kiss a girl ?
yes .
once .
was she pretty ?
the girl you kissed ?
i don' t know .
i was blindfolded .
it was at a party .
one of those kissing games .
i don' t suppose that really counts , does it ?
it didn' t with me .
i' ve been kissed twice .
once , a man i' d never seen before kissed me on the cheek ... ... when he picked me up off the ice .
i was crying .
and the other was a friend of father' s who kissed my hand .
you wouldn' t say those counted , would you ?
i wouldn' t say so .
i know , almost for certain , margot would never kiss anyone ... ... unless she was engaged to them .
and i' m sure , too , that mother never touched a man before father .
but i don' t know .
things are so different now .
what do you think ?
do you think a girl shouldn' t kiss anyone except if she' s engaged or something ?
it' s so hard to try to think what to do .
here we are with the whole world falling around our ears ... ... and you think ... ... well , you don' t know what' s going to happen tomorrow .
what do you think ?
i suppose it depends on the girl .
with some , no matter what they do , it' s wrong .
but others ... ... it wouldn' t necessarily be wrong with them .
i always thought that
i think i should go now .
that' s right .
good night .
you won' t let them stop you from coming ?
no .
i might bring my diary .
there are so many things in it i want to talk over with you .
there' s a lot about you .
what kind of things ?
well ... ... i wouldn' t want you to see some of it .
i thought you were nothing .
just the way you thought about me .
did you change your mind ?
i changed my mind about you .
you' il see .
good night , annele .
good night , anne .
good night .
mm hmm .
outside , there' s a quiet excitement .
invasion fever is mounting from day to day .
and people talk nothing else but the hope of liberation .
it had best come soon .
we here have had bad news .
the people from whom miep got our ration cards have been arrested .
mr. kraler is in the hospital .
it seems he has ulcers .
i' m afraid we are his ulcers .
miep has to run the business and us too .
how very fortunate we are , when you think of what is happening outside .
i feel that spring is coming .
i feel it in my whole body and soul .
i' m utterly confused .
i' m longing ... ... so longing for everything .
otto !
otto , quick !
he' s stealing the food !
mr. van daan has been stealing !
what is it ?
mr. van daan !
let me !
what happened ?
mr. van daan .
look , the bread !
dirty thief !
you good for nothing !
mr. dussel !
help me , peter !
let him go .
peter , help me !
let him go .
let him go !
putti , what is it ?
he was stealing the bread !
it was you .
and all the time we thought it was the rats .
mr. van daan , how could you ?
i' m hungry .
we' re all of us hungry .
i see the children getting thinner and thinner .
your own son , i' ve heard him moan in his sleep , he' s so hungry .
and you come down in the night and steal food that should go to the children !
he needs more food than the rest of us .
he' s used to more .
he' s a big man .
and you !
you' re worse than he is !
you' re a mother !
and yet you sacrifice your son to this man !
this
edith .
don' t think i haven' t seen you .
always saving the choicest bits for him .
i' ve watched you day after day , and i' ve held my tongue .
but not any longer .
not after this !
now , i want him to go .
i want him to get out of here !
edith .
get out of here ?
what do you mean ?
just that .
take your things and get out !
you' re speaking in anger .
you can' t mean it .
i mean exactly that .
for two years , we have lived here side by side .
we' ve respected each other' s rights .
we have managed to live in peace .
are we now going to throw it all away ?
mr. van daan , i know this is never going to happen again , is it ?
no , no .
he steals once , he' il steal again .
i want them to leave .
you go now !
mother ... ... you' re not putting peter out .
peter hasn' t done anything .
i don' t mean peter .
peter can stay .
i have to go if he goes .
he' s my father .
he' s no father to you , that man .
he doesn' t know what it is to be a father !
i wouldn' t feel right .
i couldn' t stay .
very well , then .
peter .
no .
mrs. frank , you would put us out on the street ?
you can find another hiding place .
where would we even find a cellar ?
a closet ?
mr. frank ...
... you told putti ... ... you would never forget what he did for you when you first came to holland .
that you' d never be able to repay
if my husband had any obligations to you , he has paid it .
edith , i don' t know you .
i' ve never seen you like this .
i should have spoken out long ago .
you can' t be nice to some people .
there would be plenty if you hadn' t come .
no , mrs. van daan .
please !
we don' t need the nazis to destroy us .

wednesday , the 2nd of july , 1944 .
the invasion seems temporarily bogged down .
mr. kraler is back in the hospital .
he has to have an operation .
it seems d day was too much for him .
thank you .
ha , ha .
the joke is on us .
miep says the warehouse man doesn ' t know a thing ... ... and we ' re paying him all that money .
our dear vegetable man is on his way to a concentration camp .
he was picked up today for hiding two jews in his house .
there' s not much .
it was mr. hauk , our greengrocer , they arrested .
the other news is , the gestapo have found our typewriter that was stolen .
no !
they' il trace it back and back until it gets to us .
you watch , you !
everyone is low .
even father can ' t raise their spirits .
i have often been downcast myself , but never in despair .
i can shake off everything if i write , but ... ... and that is the great question , will i ever be able to write well ?
i want to so much .
i want to go on living even after my death .
there it goes again .
mr. frank , do you hear ?
yes , i hear .
this is the third time .
third time in quick successions .
it' s a signal .
i tell you , it' s miep , trying to get us .
for some reason , she can' t get to us .
she' s trying to warn us of something .
please , mr. dussel .
please .
you' re wasting your breath .
something' s happened , mr. frank .
it' s been three days now that miep hasn' t been to see us .
and today , not a man has come to work .
there hasn' t been a sound in the building .
perhaps it' s sunday .
we may have lost track of the days .
you with the diary there , what day is it ?
i don' t lose track of the days .
i know exactly what day it is .
it' s friday , the 4th of august .
it' s friday and not a man at work .
i tell you , mr. kraler' s dead .
that' s the only explanation .
he' s dead .
they' ve closed down the building , and miep' s trying to tell us .
she' d never telephone us .
please , i beg of you , answer the phone .
no .
just pick it up and listen .
you don' t have to speak .
just listen and see if it' s miep .
for god' s sake , answer the telephone !
i' ve told you , no .
i' il do nothing that might let anyone know that we' re in this building .
mr. frank' s right .
no need to tell us what side you' re on .
lf we wait here quietly and patiently ... ... i believe that help will come .
mr. dussel .
mr. dussel .
mr. dussel !
too late .
so we just wait here ...
... until we die .
i can' t stand it .
i' il kill myself .
for heaven' s sake , stop it !
i think you would be glad if i did .
you want me to die .
whose fault is it we' re here ?
we could' ve been safe in america or switzerland .
but no , no .
you wouldn' t leave when i wanted to .
you couldn' t leave your precious things .
your furniture !
that' s right , blame it all on me .
it' s all my fault .
your hats , shoes , dishes !
i never had anything i really wanted .
everything was for your pleasure !
look , peter .
look at the sky .
aren' t the clouds beautiful ?
what a lovely , lovely day .
you know what i do ... ... when i think i can' t stand another minute of being cooped up ?
i think myself outside .
i think i' m on a walk in the park where i used to go with father ... ... where crocus and jonquils and the violets grow along the slopes .
you know ... ... the most wonderful part of thinking yourself outside ?
you can have it any way you like .
you can have roses and violets and tulips all blooming in the same season .
isn' t that wonderful ?
when i was outside , i used to take it all for granted .
and now in here , i' ve just gone crazy about nature .
i' ve just gone crazy .
i think if something doesn' t happen soon ... ... if we don' t get out of here ... ... i can' t stand much more of this .
i wish you had a religion , peter .
no , thanks .
not me .
i don' t mean you have to be orthodox ... ... or believe in heaven and hell and purgatory and things .
i just mean some religion .
it doesn' t matter what .
just to believe in something .
when i think of all that' s out there ... ... trees and flowers ... ... and those sea gulls ....
when i think of the dearness of you , peter ...
... and the goodness of the people we know ... ... mr. kraler and miep , the vegetable man ... ... all of them risking their lives for us every day ... ... when i think of these good things , i' m not afraid anymore .
i find myself .
and god , and l  that' s fine .
but ....
when i begin to think ... ... i get mad .
look at us .
hiding out here for two years .
not able to move .
caught like
waiting for them to come and get us .
we' re not the only people that have had to suffer .
there have always been people that have had to .
sometimes one race , sometimes another .
and yet  that doesn' t make me feel any better .
i know it' s terrible , trying to have any faith ... ... when people are doing such horrible ....
but you know what i sometimes think ?
i think the world may be going through a phase ... ... the way i was with mother .
it' il pass .
maybe not for hundreds of years ... ... but someday .
i still believe ... ... in spite of everything ... ... that people are really good at heart .
i wanna see something now .
not a thousand years from now .
but , peter ... ... if you' d only look at it as part of a great pattern ... ... that we' re just a little minute in life .
listen to us .
going at each other like a couple of stupid grownups .
look at the sky .
isn' t it lovely ?
someday , when we get outside again ... ... i' m going to
open !
open !
open !
open !
for the past two years , we have lived in fear .
now we can live in hope .
and so it seems our stay here is over .
they' ve given us just a moment to get our things .
we can each take a bag and whatever it will hold of clothing .
nothing else .
so , dear diary ... ... that means i must leave you behind .
goodbye for a while .
p. s. , please , please , anyone ... ... if you should find this diary , will you please keep it safe for me ?
because someday i hope that
no more .
i had gone to the country to try to find food .
when i got back , the police were in the building .
we made it our business to learn how they knew .
it was the thief who told them .
we knew the thief .
he was
it seems strange to me now .
but we were all full of hope in the camp here in holland , where they first took us .
the news of the war was good .
the allies were sweeping through france .
we felt sure they would get to us in time to
but ....
in september , we were shipped to poland .
men to one camp , women to another .
from there , they were sent to belsen .
i stayed in auschwitz .
in january , we were freed , the few of us who were left .
the war was not yet over , no .
t ook us a long time to get home .
each time the train would stop ... ... we' d all get out at a siding or a crossing ... ... and walk from group to group .
where were you ?
were you at belsen ?
at buchenwald ?
at mauthausen ?
where ?
ls it possible that you ever knew my wife ?
did you ever see my husband ?
my son ?
my daughter ?
that' s how i found out about my wife' s death .
margot' s .
van daans ' .
peter .
dussel .
but ... ... anne ....
i still hoped ....
yesterday , i was in rotterdam .
i met a woman there .
she' d been in belsen with anne .
i know now .
in spite of everything ... ... i still believe that people are really good at heart .
she puts me to shame .
