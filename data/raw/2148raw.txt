police raid !
after the war , tokyo was a jungle
the weak went to the wall
every day was a fight for life
kill or be killed
watch out !
there' s a body coming through !
mr abe ...
what ?
starved to death ?
yup .
times are tough
a drink for luck !
two , since morning
the japanese have really lost heart
well , keep eating my sweet potatoes and you won' t go hungry !
and that' s the truth , not the lies they told you in the army !
these are kintoki brand from saitama
eat all you want , little sister !
hey !
stop her !
you really that hungry ?
eat all you want 100 yen .
you buy ?
ok ?
she' s pretty , no ?
very , very pretty .
you buy ?
come back !
i' m from yoshino gang
i can sort this out
if i do ... ... can i have a fuck ?
all right
move !
out of the way !
excuse me !
know where i can find work ?
ever been with a man ?
who' s she ?
wants to join us
your name ?
it' s maya
i' m miyo
i' m o roku the idiot ...
at your service , madam !
it' s hard work at first
watch us and learn
find a man and sell yourself
it' s as simple as that
and there' s no pimps to take your money afterwards
you know those signs you see on fish shops ? ...
direct from seller to buyer " it' s the best way ...
makes sense
and remember nobody' il protect you but us
don' t forget that .
ok ?
and obey our rules
like from yuraku cho to kachidoki bridge ...
if you see a new girl , tell us ...
that' s our territory !
it' s self protection
it' s our right !
the yoshino gang help us out with things like that ...
come over here
intruder !
another thing we never do is give it for free .
understand ?
selling our bodies is our business
bad for business to give it away
we' il hurt you if you do
torture you till you' re half dead !
get me ?
hold on !
wait till i undress
go on .
i' il watch .
it il wake me up
you come in without being asked then leave ... ... without a goodbye ?
let me go !
leave your stuff and i will !
not even enough dough to pay her !
arsehole !
hang on !
you made me lose business !
okay ?
that' s for your trouble
fine
where you back from ?
pacific ?
north
your boyfriend go south ?
my brother
he was in borneo
a brother , huh ?
hey , you want business ?
i' m no cradle snatcher ... !
bastard !
they' re eager !
got to eat properly once in a while , huh ?
o sen , how about that fuck ?
all right , but no discount
what ?
going to charge me ?
of course
is it ?
it sure isn' t
o fuku broke our rule
went with a student ... ... who was selling raffle tickets under the bridge
she did it for free
i feel sorry for her
sorry ?
why ?
her hair ...
cutting off all her hair ...
you' re getting soft ...
eh ?
o machi ? !
that o machi is such a bitch !
thinks she' s better than us
makes me sick
she came about a month before you
you want it ?
i saw her trying to pull a customer so i scared her off
then she started to cry ... ... and , like a fool , ... ...
i fell for her sob story
but i hate her .
she' s so stuck up ...
must you go now ?
early start tomorrow morning
your wife' s lucky
going all the way to fukushima to see her
have to .
her father would bawl me out ...
a kept man ...
it' s nice to be a wife
i wish i was one ...
your husband was a teacher ?
yes .
on the reserve list but sent to iwojima
i sometimes wonder ... ... how he died
it was awful !
that last guy really stank !
now i feel like i do !
smell , o roku
no thank you !
wash well , maya .
disease and babies are our enemies !
don' t remind me !
my mother ... ... she drowned in the river
with my little brother
at daichi .
he was only 7 years old
where were you ?
i was working at the factory
everyone who jumped into the river or got on boats died
a sumo man died hanging onto the side of the boat
his wrists above the water were burned all black
that' s enough !
we' re all victims of the war !
that' s what we call ... ...
persecution complex !
if my brother hadn' t died in borneo ...
here we go again maya and borneo
let' s call her borneo maya
that' s not a bad name ...
o roku , what was that thing you used to say ?
my curse ?
to spit in the eye of the world and his wife !
stuff them !
a curse ?
yes , a curse !
curse everything !
waifs , tramps , babies , workers , wives ...
parents , grown ups ...
buildings , trains , trucks ...
realizing nobody would help us ... ... made us know what to expect
in order to survive , we stuck close together
it was the will to live ... ... that kept us going
listen , bitch , don' t push me too far !
this is our territory !
territory ! ?
that' s what made us lose the war !
we' re a democracy now !
democracy means fucking foreigners ... ?
i don' t think so !
there' s a difference between democracy and collaboration
hey , come on !
come on !
look here , o sen !
you' il get us into trouble if you fight here
so what ?
why should we care ?
you men are soft !
like these stupid whores !
what' s that ?
you heard me !
i' il show you who i am !
llon heart
you' ve a nice body
you' d look good tattooed all over
i once saw a geisha with a spider tattooed on her thigh
stood out in relief ... ... whenever she drank or got excited
that tattoo made me want to take up this work
power !
that' s what i want !
a power that' il make me invincible !
i know ...
like those people way back ... ... who got tattooed to fight wild beasts
what' s up ?
an ex soldier stabbed a gl !
scared the shit out of me , i can tell you !
a fight ?
it was so quick .
i don' t know ...
seems the japanese spirit lives on !
why don' t you show some then ?
it' s not so easy now .
democracy .
everything' s democracy
over here , maya !
no business ?
i hate it when it' s slow like this
a bowl of noodles
women should be wives , don' t you think ?
i remember my own childhood
my parents loved each other and it was a peaceful home
then father strayed and left home
but he came back
it wasn' t because of me
but father couldn' t forget her
he couldn' t forget her body
you don' t know what happens ... ... do you , little maya ?
when a man and a woman ... ... have passed ... ... through the gate of flesh
you don' t know the secrets of the flesh , do you little maya ?
don' t call me little maya !
maya' s enough !
feeling lonely ?
come on , let' s go
got the money ?
don' t worry !
let' s get it over with
it' s hot
japanese women are such sluts now !
so ?
you men are to blame !
you lost the war !
what ?
want to fuck me or not ?
eh ?
money first !
later , baby ...
he' s gone
there he goes !
come on !
he escape ... !
he escape ... !
o machi' s acting strange
never here these days
seems restless when she does come back
not her usual self
maya , what do you think ?
well ...
she said she hated the work
she can quit any time !
same as us and acting the lady !
her regular .
he had to move out to the country
what' s that ... ?
someone get me some sake !
you' re hurt ?
a scratch .
the cops are after me
you' re safe here .
maya go buy some
we meet again
you stabbed that gi in the market ?
i had my reasons
not found him yet ?
it hurts ?
' course not !
good as new in 20 days
we' re made that way
you' re a lucky man
the rain' s washed the blood away
the cops have lost the trail
you can rest up here !
can t he , sen ?
what' s your name ?
ibuki shintaro , a former corporal !
unemployed !
this place is just like a field hospital ...
your work' s nobi ?
katsuage ?
haikuru , i reckon
what you talking about ?
you don' t know ?
our words for housebreaking , blackmail or thief ...
idiots !
talking tough ...
and you' re only kids !
acting like grown ups
makes me laugh !
you know nothing of life !
you' re a burglar !
that' s the coolest !
i' m tired
this is our place !
i' il decide who goes !
just eats , so he has enough strength to fight
i respected him
in primitive life , the strongest becomes leader
soon ibuki became the centre of our lives
say , is that rice ready ?
i lived through all the horrors of war !
you lot think this is hard .
that' s a laugh !
you' re having a whale of a time , enjoying life !
can t tell who' s the parasite now
he' s wild been cooped up too long .
right ?
be quiet !
i' m off !
before we' re shouted at again ...
be a good boy !
look after the house for us
still here ?
get to work !
here ...
this is for you
you like pineapples ?
sure glad to have these in the north china mountains
nothing tasted better
promised i' d stuff myself on them one day
you like a treat ?
sure .
what' s life besides food and sex ?
the noblest words mean nothing without them
yes , that' s why we lost the war
but the big shots still talk big !
i' il never trust them again !
now i live for food and sex !
shin' s touchy , but a real man
laughs like a little boy
just like my brother
be great if he stays with us
got any canned stuff ?
pineapples ?
american
yes , how much 20 yen
don' t get caught
hey you !
you scared me !
sorry .
i want to talk to her
have you seen him again ?
who ?
the guy who stabbed the gl ?
you were with him when the mp' s came ...
haven' t seen him .
don' t know him
listen , sen ...
help me
he scares me .
he' s got guts
he stole a load of stuff from yokohama px warehouse
got some buddies and a gi to help him
must have been that gi he stabbed
guess they quarrelled
and if i find him ?
i just want to talk to him
do a deal with him
you want the stuff
we' il pay , of course it il be a good deal
if i see him , i' il tell him
you do that

what' s that ?

it' s pineapples !!! ?
excuse me ... ... but who are you ?
i' m staying here
you one of them ?
yes
you' re different
oh ...
hello
i can' t stay ...
say hello to the others for me
she makes me sick !
with ibuki around ... ... someone' s bound to break the rule
that' s going to cause problems
it' s time to remind ourselves ... ... how horrible the punishment can be
o machi went and did it , sen
she broke our rule
she did it for free !
i never trusted her .
i knew she' d betray us !
can we punish her , sen ?
yes , if there' s proof !
we' il do it !
there' s proof all right .
last night , in the hotel ...
here , this is for you
no , please
i don' t want your money
but that' s ...
when we' re together , i pretend i' m your wife
when i' m with other men ... ...
i think only that i will soon be with you
then i feel better
what' s going on ?
just wait and see
what is it ?
you' il soon find out
hide !
are you alone ?
what' s up ?
o machi !
take off your clothes !
we' il punish you !
what ?
i didn' t ... !
shut up !
strip , or it' il hurt !
o roku heard it all !
that' s right !
now get them off !
god !
she' s well stacked !
dirty slut !
i don' t even care if i kill her !
on her backside !
sounds better !
come on !
you' ve never loved a man !
you' re jealous ... ...
because i know the secrets of the flesh !
see , o machi !
we sell ourselves for money !
doing it for free !
you' re a traitor !
it' s still not enough
i' ve got it !
wait !
i' il show you
what' il you do ?
just guess
what a great idea !
now she won' t flaunt her body !
stand up machiko
careful or you' il get hurt
what' re you going to do ?
if i die , i' il come back !
i' il haunt you !
haunt us ?
you don' t scare us ...
alright .
stop this nonsense and let her go
she' s had enough
this american stew' s good !
and cheap too
what you smiling at ?
you remind me of someone
when i went to grade school ... ... my third year ... ... a boy played a red demon in a play
a cooper' s son
dark skinned boy
he looked cute ... ... in the red paper demon' s mask
so i' m like a red demon ?
not really ...
more like my brother
the hero was a sumo wrestler' s son
really stuck up .
i hated him
the red demon was bad ... ... but i felt i would like to be eaten by him
you fancied him ?
guess so
after he moved away , i couldn' t eat for a week
how old are you ?
a wounded beast wants to return to his wild life when he' s well
ibuki went out from time to time
when you didn' t come , i thought you' d left tokyo
i almost did
look after my gear for me
i' il come back for it
what is it ?
not hot gear ?
' course not .
i wouldn' t put a friend' s father in danger
don' t do anything too silly
you survived , remember
maybe you think it wasn' t worth it
but still ... ... just think of those who didn' t make it
the problem' s money .
you can' t do anything without it
shin , you know you can' t go on like this ...
you might get caught
i' il be gone before then
that' s not what i meant !
if you want money now , how about that yoshino deal ?
the occupation stuff !
you hid it ?
why not ?
ah , yes ! ...
the deal ...
don' t do it !
you' re better off as a thief .
it' s safer !
mr ishii the boss !
pleased to meet you
i hear you got some ... ... hot stuff ?
penicillin .
only 200 left .
you want it ?
can you guarantee it' s ... ... not fake ?
if you don' t want it , others will
these amateurs are touchy !
all right ...
pay him now
i' il keep some ...
for my clothes
want a receipt ?
don' t be stupid
if you cheat us , we' il find you
where' s the stuff ?
when can you get it ?
out past matsudo
day after tomorrow , same time ?
ok !
so what do you say ?
could you really take a woman like me ... ... as a wife ?
you ask that now ?
but it seems like a dream
my father in law' s slave at 40 .
i' m ashamed
i want to be independent .
start again ; you and me , huh ?
wonderful
you' re really sweet , you know ?
i' m so happy
having fun ?
it' s not like that
how are the girls ?
those pests ?
who cares !
eating , sleeping in the dark !
they' re filth
aren' t you ... ... on their side ?
you joking ?
i hate them !
i get sick watching them act big !
i could kill them !
listen ... ... are you free tonight ?
all right
wherever you want
you don' t know how i feel
machiko' s a witch , making shin her slave !
i' il become a witch too !
it' s strange ...
what ?
for so long i' ve dreamed ... ... of just being a wife again
why do i hesitate ... ... now i have the chance to be one ?
somehow , i don' t know ...
it just doesn' t seem important now
you just have to go the whole way
no use thinking and wavering
japan must go all the way too
if she sinks , suffers , and starts over ... ... she' il find a way to survive
who are you saying this for ?
me ...
or yourself ?
i' m just saying rely on your own instincts
listen , want to live with me ?
be serious !
it was just a bit of fun
so , shin still hasn' t come back
he' s never coming back !
o machi did it out of spite
his fault too !
o roku , shin' s not to blame !
it' s shin !
what you gonna do with that ?
eat it !
i was a butcher in the army
you lot need feeding up
how' il we eat it ?
kill it , of course
kill it ? !!
that took time
o miyo you go shikiten
give me a smoke
shikiten ?
keep watch
wipe yourself
what' s up ?
my cow' s gone
what ?
cow ?
gone
it' s not here ...
stinks !
what' s up ?
ibuki was here yesterday
o roku !
go now ...
now they want to close the market
is there any way ... ?
any way what ?
i have a problem ...
it was all my idea
i can' t cause the gang trouble
what' re you trying to say ?
come on !
can the deal be dropped ?
will he give back the money ?
what ?
don' t talk like a kid !
silly boy !
it may be wood alcohol , but don' t be scared !
i' il drink it !
don' t blame me if you die
i' il haunt you if i do !
well , i drank the most of it !
so i' il be dead too !
i don' t mind dying !
me neither !
meat costs 40 yen per pound ?
so do we .
same price !
it' s true
human flesh same price as meat !
that' s funny !
don' t you think so ?
eat 40 yen meat , sell ourselves for 40 yen what' s the diff ?
do we eat to sell or sell to eat ?
so what are we living for ?
search me
stop this crap !
we' re alive , and we' re eating ...
what more could we want ?
nothing !
watching you getting that cow down those narrow steps
amazing !
in the army i used to take donkeys over cliff roads , down ravines
i' m an expert donkey trainer
must have been really tough ...
what would you know !
i don' t want your sympathy !
oongratulatlons on your oall up
good luok on the way
my brother took this with him
any donkeys in borneo ?
in borneo ?
i don' t know
your brother died there ?
congratulations on your call up
seems so sad ...
they all marched off to die
look lively , girls !
i' il show you " the heroic landing " !
brother ...
suicide ?
so they say ...
look at you useless lot !
shin ...
have a drink with me !
can t take any more
did you really sleep with o machi ?
yeah .
so what ?
what a fool !
with that slut ...
she' s no slut .
she' s a real woman
i' m a real woman too !
aren' t i , shin !
aren' t i ? ...
stay what you are .
a tough , tattooed girl ...
oh , shin ...
now go away !
i' m sleepy
you slob !
useless filthy crook !
get the fuck out of here !
stop it !
what do you want ?
to kill you and die !
please ...
take me now
i love you !
i love you !
where you going ?
to sell the meat
we can' t eat it all
i heard sen last night ... ... told you to get out
what you going to do ?
it' s time to go , anyway
shin !
explain something for me ...
for the first time i love a man , but i' il be thrown out
the instant i become a woman ... ...
i' m rejected
i' m cursed ...
i' il starve to death
being a woman means i can' t live here
i' m an outcast
this is too deep for me !
listen ...
want to get the hell out of here ?
meet me at hinode bridge at 9 ,
gotta clear up some business
i' il be there
i promise
understand ?
o roku , you tell mr abe
shin made us do it !
got to show him !
he mustn t think we' re in it with him
let' s give o machi' s treatment to maya !
him and maya , both just as bad !
you' re joking ! ...
aren' t you ?
why would i lie !
hurry !
he' il skip with the penicillin !
quick !
somebody tell mr ishii !
have him call the mp' s !
damned ibuki !
i wasn' t happy keeping it for you
afraid it might get lost
i wish it had
what is it ?
a friend' s .
all that' s left of him now
be a shame to burn it
keep it to remind you
sorry i came so early
take care now
going ?
all right ...
you take care , too
be sure to write
marry a nice girl and settle down
wait
for luck
one !
two !
three !
pull !!
shin ...
come on !
quickly !
pull him out !
shit !
this isn' t penicillin !
i' m an outcast
and i' il live my life as an outcast
even if it takes me straight to hell !
the end
