you don' t know the half of it .
what ?
last night we seen gig' s car parked in front of nancy' s .
listen to this .
so we decided we' d move it , hide it on him .
so we' re moving it down the center of the street ... when along comes sgt. bert .
so mooch tells him we can' t get it started , you know ?
he says , " i don' t care .
you' re blocking traffic .
move it out of the way .
so then he gets out of the car , comes over to us ... and he' s helping us move gig' s car .
just then , gig comes out of the house ... and he' s yelling , " who' s stealing my car ?
i thought bertie would drop his teeth .
i bet he did .
if gig didn' t cover for us , we would' ve been in trouble .
yeah , you know , i' d sure hate to cross bertie again tonight .
hey , what happened with you and dave ?
i got a lecture .
promised to be a good boy .
you know , dave' s a good guy .
i think we have been steaming him up a little too much .
there' s about two inches of rubber on the street outside doc' s house .
hey , i almost forgot .
i gotta do something for the doc .
what ?
i gotta go up and check on some people .
you wanna come with me ?
oh , no , man .

there' s a man here with some sort of a parasite on his arm .
it' s assimilating his flesh at a frightening speed .
i may have to get ahead of it and amputate .
no , l i don' t know what it is or where it came from .
man , look at that , will you ?
what is it ?
wow , i don' t know .
tony , look .
hey , what landed here ?
we must be getting close to the front line .
hey , why would anybody leave a lantern here ?
i don' t know .
what is it , steve ?
it' s hot .
watch it .
a shooting star ?
hey , we saw that too !
a real big one , like a skyrocket .
oh , yeah , about an hour ago .
you think this is it ?
i don' t know .
let me see .
wow , a real piece of sky .
here , mooch .
you mean that this little pebble has been out there hot roddin ' around the universe ?
probably big as the moon when it started .
no kiddin ' !
let me see it , mooch .
and this is all that' s left ?
well , it' s all that' s here .
i' il bet there is a house close by .
doesn' t sound like a house .
it sounds like a dog .
come on , steve .
let' s go look .
yeah , sure .
hey , wait a minute .
hey , there' s a house .
hey , real nice .
you think anybody' s here ?
hello ?
hello ?

okay .
come on .
come on .
come on .
come on .
come on .
come on , pal .
come on .
ohhh .

i guess it' s the old man' s dog .
don' t you worry , baby .
you' il be all right .
think this is the place ?
it sure looks like it .
this is a cozy spot .
no neighbors , no cars , no roads , no lights .
yeah , and no movies .
come on , you guys , let' s get outta here .
let' s go , mooch .
i guess there' s nothing else you can find out here , steve .
no , no , i guess not .
why don' t you come with us to the spooky show , huh ?
you' d like it .
no , no thanks .
ah , you gotta stop takin ' everything so serious like .

what about the dog ?
i don' t know .
i mean , we can' t just leave him here .
he' d starve to death .
yeah , that' s right .
couldn' t we take him with us ?
sure .
i guess that' s the least we could do for the old man .
come on , let' s go .
oh , hello , kate .
thanks for coming back .
it' s okay .
what do you want me to do ?
you better take his pulse .
but don' t touch that material on his right hand .
it absorbs flesh on contact , like an acid .
doctor , where is he ?
what do you mean ?
kate , stand still .
don' t move .
it must have absorbed the old man completely .
i don' t know what this is , but it' s got to be killed before it gets any bigger .
oh , doctor , i' m afraid .
try to stay as far away from it as you can .
kate , be calm !
now do as i say .
behind you .
the trichloroacetic acid .
throw it !
throw it ?
yes , but for heaven' s sake , don' t get any of it on your hands .
doctor , nothing will stop it .
a gun .
in my den .
i' ve got to go for it , kate .
now try to stay absolutely still .
don' t go .
don' t leave me .
i' il be right back .
doctor , come back !
come back !
kate , what' s the matter ?
kate !
kate , what is it ?
kate !
kate !
listen , you stay there , and i' il go in and tell the doc .
it doesn' t look like there' s anybody here .
yeah .
well , maybe he took the old man to the hospital .
anyway , i' il check .
okay .
listen , i' m gonna check in the garage and see if the doc' s car is there .
oh , okay .
steve .
steve , what' s the matter ?
steve , tell me what happened .
i can' t .
well , what happened ?
it was so  steve , what is it ?
it' s got the doc .
it' s got  what' s the matter with him ?
just like the thing on the old man' s hand , only it was bigger .
then it was on his whole head , and then in just a second he disappeared .
he disappeared ?
he was all gone .
he was all gone .
you know , he just disappeared .
steve , what are you talking about ?
i' m sorry .
get in the car , jane .
well , what are you gonna do , steve ?
we' re gonna go to the police .
they' il know what to do .
well , we can get someone over there tomorrow .
yeah .
we' il have someone over there first thing in the morning .
well , what' s this ?
hey , watch it , dave .
don' t mix up the pieces .
ritchie , you old buzzard .
i didn' t know you were a chess player .
it' s like i' ve been telling you , dave .
you' re not the only thinker around here .
it' s nothing .
just a hobby , you know ?
well , wait .
wait a minute .
i think this is interesting .
who do you play with ?
well , late at night when i' m here by myself and things are pretty slow , l
well , you gotta do something .
you oughta take up chess .
loosen up your gray matter a little .
i guess i' d better .
you' il have to teach me , ritchie .
sure , dave .
anytime .
dave , doc hallen' s been killed .
doc hallen ?
what happened ?
you gotta come now !
wait a minute , steve .
tell us what happened .
i' m trying to tell you .
now this thing , it killed the doc .
what was it ?
out with it , kid .
well , it' s kind of like a ma
it' s kind of like a mass that keeps getting bigger and bigger .
come on , steve , make sense .
i know , i know .
look , dave , you gotta see this thing to believe what i' m telling you .
maybe the thing you saw was a ... monster ?
yeah , maybe it was .
i don' t know .
hold on , jim .
now , what is it , steve ?
a little while ago it was driving backwards , and now it' s monsters .
look , he' s not making it up , dave .
honest .
dave , i' m not kidding .
come on over to the doc' s .
you can see it for yourself .
you' re crazy if you go .
can' t you see it' s a gag ?
he says doc hallen' s dead , jim .
we' ve got to check it out .
let' s go .
ritchie , you mind the store .
dave , listen
east cornwall , downingtown h. q
downingtown , east cornwall h. q.
q to k 2 .
do i read you right ?
q to k 2 ?
roger .
k 9 to kb 5 .
shucks .
this office will be closed all day saturday .
dr. hallen .
wait a minute .
what' s the matter ?
the thing might be in there waiting for you .
well , we' il have to take that chance , won' t we ?
i' m not kidding .
dr. hallen ?
dr. hallen ?
hmm .
seems to be a short circuit in here .
you got your light ?
everything looks okay .
there .
i think this is the room i saw him in .
it' s locked .
i' il see if i can find a key that' il work .
no , the key' s already here .
it' s been locked from the inside .
hello ?
who' s in there ?
better go around and see if the window' s unlocked .
if it isn' t , break the glass , come in and unlock the door .
all right .
you' re not gonna let him do that .
now , don' t worry , steve .
sergeant bert knows how to handle himself .
and this is the only way to get to the bottom of this .
i' il see if i can find the fuse box .
okay .
steve , i wonder where the little dog is .
yeah .
what do you think happened to him ?
i don' t know .
well , that' s more like it .
this must have been what blew the fuse .
jim ?
wait till you get a load of this mess !
ohh .
what about this , steve ?
i don' t know , dave .
but i know i saw the doc .
all right , kid , cut the act .
what really happened here ?
i don' t know .
all of a sudden , your mind is a blank ?
no .
steve , are you sure this is the room ?
yes , i' m sure of it .
this has been fired .
but i haven' t seen any shot marks around anyplace .
let me tell you what happened , kid .
you and whoever else was in on this thought you' d put one over on the police .
so you break in here , you mess the place up  wait a minute , jim .
the kids couldn' t have done this .
you saw for yourself .
the window was locked from the inside , and so was the door .
they rigged it with string .
it' s part of their plan to make us look silly .
i think you' re doing that pretty well by yourself , sergeant .
steve , was there anybody else with you ?
no .
how about when i stopped you over on morgan street ?
those kids had nothing to do with this .
who were they ?
why , it was tony and mooch .
those kids ?
well , there' s your answer right there !
they' re just the kind of kids to pull a trick like this .
but this time they' ve gone too far .
what goes on out here ?
land' s sakes !
what are you doing here , mrs. porter ?
boy oh boy oh boy !
wait till doctor gets back and sees this !
back from where ?
lieutenant , was it burglars ?
we don' t know yet .
where is dr. hallen ?
johnsonville .
a medical convention .
you know , i told him this would happen one of these days , the way he leaves everything unlocked .
of course , it was my fault too .
he asked me to keep an eye on the place .
but that' s not true , dave .
he never left .
i don' t think i' ve had the pleasure .
this is steve andrews , mrs. porter .
he seems to think the doctor got into some trouble here tonight .
no , sir !
the doctor don' t know anything about this .
he called me just before he left .
he didn' t leave .
look , dave , i' il bet his car is still in the garage .
might be .
doctor sometimes goes in somebody else' s car .
dr. gilpen from over in groverton .
jim , call dr. gilpen .
right .
he won' t be home .
just checking .
mrs. porter , did you hear any gunshots tonight ?
i sure did !
tonight and every other night .
the people downstairs have those old movies on their television .
there' s always some shooting or screaming .
whoever this thief was , he didn' t have to tear up the place like this .
i feel terrible .
wait a minute , mrs. porter .
i don' t want this touched .
well , i don' t want the doctor to come back tomorrow and find the place like this .
it' s bad enough the window' s broke and all .
but , mrs. porter
now , you boys have your work to do , and i have mine .
there' s a criminal walking around out there free as a bird .
you go get him .
let me clean up here .
mrs. porter , you don' t understand .
we may want to check here for fingerprints later .
dr. gilpen' s on his way to johnsonville .
did he pick up dr. hallen ?
i spoke with mrs. gilpen , and she said that dr. hallen had called around 11 : 00 , just after her husband left , but she thought they were going together .
where can we reach them in johnsonville ?
i didn' t ask her that .
st. john' s hotel .
that' s where the doctor usually stays .
well , they should be there in a couple of hours .
we' il leave word to have him call us when he checks in .
can' t i just dust around the fingerprints ?
tomorrow .
well , let' s go , kids .
dave , this is all wrong .
all right , kid , the show' s over .
it was a cute act , but this time it didn' t work .
this locked door business really hung you .
if everything happened like you said , where' s the doctor ?
and where is this old man ?
and where is the big , bad monster ?
i don' t know .
hand me that small hammer , will ya ?
why don' t you finish that tomorrow ?
i ain' t gonna be here .
i' m goin ' on a huntin ' trip .
i didn' t know you was a hunter .
neither did i.
we got a little cabin up in the south woods , the boys and me .
and i' m tellin ' you , marty boy , we' re goin ' up there this weekend , and i' m gonna get so roarin ' , stinkin ' , no good drunk ...
i won' t be able to see .
hey , why don' t you come with us ?
it' il do you some good .
oh , i don' t think martha would figure it that way .
do you have to tell your old woman everything ?
tell her your uncle died .
tell her you' re going away so you can love her more when you get back .
good night .
boy , i' m so tired of lookin ' at the guts of secondhand cars ...
i could spit grease .
you know , marty , if i didn' t get away once in a while , i' d blow a gasket .
when i come in on monday , if mr. johnson looks at me funny just once just once you know what i' m gonna do to him , marty ?
hey , marty !
look , you keep telling me about a monster .
all i want to do is clear this thing up .
all right , i agree .
but i still don' t see why you had to call our folks .
dave , it' s for you .
what else could i do ?
well , give us a chance to find out what happened .
you know we didn' t tear up doc' s house .
how long have you known me ?
all right , i believe you !
but i still don' t think you' re telling me all you know .
oh , dave .
hello ?
yeah .
well , young lady , do you mind telling me where you' ve been spending the evening ?
daddy , it' s all right .
oh , yes , everything' s fine .
i always stop by the police station to pick up my daughter .
don' t you realize what this could do to me ?
by morning , it will be all over town .
we were just trying to warn people .
after all , i am principal of the high school .
young man , this is the last time you' re ever going to take my daughter out !
steve didn' t do anything wrong !
mr. andrews , can you make anything out of all this ?
i can' t .
take it easy , mr. martin .
we' il straighten everything out .
hello , son .
dad , i saw something terrible tonight .
and nobody' il believe us .
mr. martin , mr. andrews , uh , apparently doc hallen' s office was broken into by vandals tonight .
and steve and jane seem to know something about it .
vandals ?
my daughter ?
well , you don' t think our kids were mixed up in it , do you ?
all we know is that they told us something had happened over at dr. hallen' s house .
we' re not accusing anyone of what we found .
we can' t be more definite until we contact dr. hallen in johnsonville .
dad , it isn' t vandalism !
dr. hallen is dead , and he was killed by some sort of a monster .
now , i know because i saw it , dad .
lieutenant , i want you to know that steve is not in the habit of telling lies .
if he says he' s not mixed up in this vandalism , you can be sure it' s the truth .
did you see this thing too , jane ?
well ...
no , not exactly .
well , look , folks , we' il all know more in the morning after we' ve called johnsonville .
i think the best thing now is for all of us to go home and get some sleep .
maybe it' s a good idea , son .
we can talk about this some more at home .
sure , pop .
get out of the house as fast as you can .
i' il be over .
maybe bertie' s right .
maybe this is just a gag like those school fraternities were throwing last year .
remember how they stitched that bathing suit to the statue of general hayes ?
i don' t think this is a gag .
why didn' t you book the kids then ?
why make a big thing of it tonight if we can clear the whole thing up tomorrow ?
boy , if it was bertie , he' d have them strung up by the thumbs by now .
maybe he would .
police department .
hold on .
it' s bertie .
hello ?
dave ?
yep .
a couple of people thought they heard shots , but weren' t sure .
okay , jim .
doc' s place locked up ?
yeah .
check back in , then .
right .
we' il get the truth out of those kids if it takes all night .
i sent the kids home .
home ?
are you crazy ?
jim , we' il take care of this whole thing tomorrow .
yes , sir .
is that all ?
yes , that' s all .
bertie got some idea what this is ?
i don' t care what bertie' s ideas are !
he acts like we' re still fighting the war .
just because some kid smacks into his wife on the turnpike ... doesn' t make it a crime to be 17 years old !
okay , so i don' t know what the kids are up to tonight .
but i' m not gonna throw them into a cell like a couple of vagrants .
we' il put this puzzle together in the morning .
in the meantime , at least we know where the kids are .
hey , where are you going ?
oh , shhh , danny .
shhh .
where are you going ?
i' ve got something very important to do , danny , but it' s got to be a secret .
i won' t tell anybody .
i' il go with you .
no , honey , i have to go by myself .
will you be back pretty soon ?
well , i don' t know .
aren' t you afraid to go out by yourself ?
yes , i guess i am , danny .
i' m not afraid .
i' il guard you .
oh , no , danny .
you' ve got a bigger job to do .
you' ve got to stay here and guard mommy and daddy .
oh , they don' t need guarding .
oh , look , danny , go on to beddie .
look , if you go to bed , i might bring you a little dog all your very own .
a dog !
honest ?
honest .
i cross my heart .
oh , boy !
now go on up to bed .
what' s his name ?
oh , any name you want , danny .
can i name him william ?
oh , that' s a fine name , danny .
now you better run on up to bed .
go on .
oh , i don' t like william .
you run on to bed , honey .
steve ?
steve ?
was he asleep ?
yeah .
do you think he did something wrong ?
i don' t know .
i don' t think so .
the police don' t either , or they wouldn' t have sent him home .
i felt that he was keeping something from us .
he did seem more willing to talk when we were at the station .
well , i think tomorrow he might talk and we' il be able to straighten this out .
maybe , after a good night' s sleep .
yeah .
good night .
' night , dear .
you scared me to death .
what are you doing here ?
listen , jane , i told you to wait over there .
the folks went to bed , so i thought i should just come on over .
all right , come on .
let' s go around the corner .
steve ?
huh ?
oh , i' m sorry .
at least i could' ve thanked you for coming out tonight .
you didn' t need to .
i never needed to talk to anyone before , not as much as i do now .
well , we' re in this together , aren' t we , steve ?
you know , i wish that we
i must be getting confused .
i know we saw the old man , i know we took him to the doc' s ... and i know the doc sent us out to see if we could find out what happened .
so ?
and i know the old man had something on his hand , something he couldn' t get off , something that kept getting larger .
i saw that .
and then l i think i saw the doc .
he was standing by the window , and he he was trying to get out ... and that thing was all over him ... and then ... just dissolved while i stood there .
i think i saw this .
i believe you did .
you know , plenty of people in their right mind thought they saw things that didn' t exist , you know , like flying saucers .
the light was just right , and the angle and the imagination .
boy , if that' s what it is , then this is just an ordinary night .
you and i are gonna go to sleep , and tomorrow when we get up ... that sun' s gonna shine , just like yesterday .
good old yesterday .
steve , well , you believe you did see it , don' t you ?
i don' t know . l l
that' s not true , steve .
well , maybe , maybe now you don' t want to believe it .
maybe you' d like to tell yourself it didn' t happen .
but , steve , you' re not the kind of person who can turn your back ... on something you know is true .
i don' t know .
well , you actually did see what happened to dr. hallen .
how do you know i did ?
because i know you .
okay .
now what do we do ?
how do you get people to protect themselves from something they don' t believe in ?
well , you keep trying and hoping you can find ... some sort of proof that' il convince them .
okay .
i don' t like it much , but i guess the only way you can find that is to go out and look for it .
i' il go get the car .
you sure you want to go with me ?
yes .
i wouldn' t give much for our chances ... wandering around in the middle of the night trying to find something ... that if we found it , it might kill us .
if we could only find a couple of people to help us .
hmm .
who ?
well , your friends , tony , mooch and al .
hey , you know , that that' s worth a try .
yes , i am here , the demon who possesses your soul .
wait a bit .
i am coming for you .
i have so much to show you .
tony , listen , i wanna see you outside .
hey , what gives ?
i thought you cats didn' t dig spooky shows .
this is important .
outside .
hey , what' s up ?
shhh .
i' il explain outside .
this is important .
you missed most of the picture .
you' re not gonna get your money' s worth .
none of us are , unless somebody keeps quiet .
you' re gotta come with us .
there' s nobody else we can go to .
okay , you kids , knock it off .
come on !
what ?
walk out of the movie ?
let' s cut out .
you cats gonna make it ?
not me .
i' m part of this chair , and i can' t move .
tsk .
hold up , mooch !
hey , all right , steve , you made us waste our 80 cents .
now , what gives ?
yeah , what' s the scoop ?
what' s the big idea , steve ?
would you believe me if i told you there was something inside of that rock we found , something that could wipe out this whole town ?
knock it off !
go ahead , steve .
i saw this thing kill dr. hallen tonight .
kill dr. hallen ?
that' s right .
well , what is it ?
i don' t know .
but one thing' s for sure , if it can kill dr. hallen , it can kill somebody else .
what do you want us to do , steve ?
all right , we' re gonna find this thing , and we' re gonna make people believe us .
let' s try johnsonville again , ritchie .
okay .
i just saw a strange one .
what do you mean ?
on my way back here , i ran into mr. connors coming outta that bar ... in the building he owns over on second street .
he' d just stopped in , and there was nobody there .
queerest thing i' ve ever seen .
tv was playin ' away .
the cash register was there with the money still in it .
nobody around .
no bartender , nobody .
i' il look in there on the way home .
forget it .
the place is all locked up now .
why don' t you go home and get some shut eye ?
you can' t run our shift and yours too , you know ?
yeah , i know .
i wish i knew where those two doctors were , though .
any luck , ritchie ?
nope , they' re not there .
want me to call the other hotels ?
there' s a lot of them between here and johnsonville .
no .
i guess you' re right .
i guess there' s nothing here that won' t wait till morning .
well , i' il see you guys .
good night .

it' s one thing to make a fool out of yourself , but it' s another thing to make a fool out of the police department and the town .
he' s right , lieutenant .
you' ve been wrong before .
maybe i have !
but as long as i' m in charge of this town' s police force ,

watch out !
i don' t think it can be killed .
we' ve gotta try one more thing .
okay .
is everybody all right ?
okay , but not for long .
we can drop a power line on it .
do you understand ?
there should be enough juice in that line to burn the thing to a crisp .
yeah , get everyone down in the cellar .
we' il do it in 60 seconds , steve .
cellar !
okay .
jim , here' s a rifle .
take the phone , ritchie .
all right .
dave , this baby should do the trick .
it' s all set to go .
try not to miss , jim .
okay , let' s have those lights !
fifteen seconds .
it' s quiet now .
i think the upstairs is clear .
good .
keep your ear to that phone , ritchie .
okay , jim .
it didn' t work .
why don' t you do something ?
do something !
elizabeth .
the diner' s on fire .
can' t we put it out ?
any suggestions how ?
anyway , not enough oxygen in there to keep a fire going for ten minutes .
there' s something burning .
listen , is there any other way out of here ?
the windows .
hey , now you be quiet .
shhh .
i' m not afraid .
well , i know you' re not .
hey , listen , jane

honey , lay your head down and try to go to sleep .
everything will be all right , danny .
hey , there' s the fire !
i' il stop it !
wait a minute .
let me have that a minute .
co2 !
hey , that' s it !
it' s cold !
that' s why it didn' t come in the ice box after us .
it can' t stand cold .
you got any more of these things ?
huh ?
no .
this thing' s running out .
the phone .
hey , dave !
hey , dave !
hey , da anybody on the phone ?
hey , dave !
dave , can you hear me ?
co2 !
dave !
what did he say ?
al , what' s up ?
shhh .
quiet .
co2 ?
phil !
phil , do you got any co2 extinguishers ?
not many .
some soda acid .
well , get the co2s out here and start hitting around those cellar windows .
what ?
just do it , phil !
and check these buildings for fire extinguishers .
but only the co2 kind .
bring back every one you can get your hands on .
all right .
okay .
hey , maybe we can help .
let' s get some guys together .
lieutenant , i know where there are 20 extinguishers good .
where ?
at the high school .
who can go with me ?
hey , right here , mr. martin .
well , what are we waiting for ?
let' s go .
okay , let' s go .
over here , mr. martin .
this thing' s running out !
hey , dave !
dave ?
dave , co2 fire extinguishers !
dave , can you hear me ?
co2 !
okay , come on .
oh , it' s locked .
of course it' s locked .
here comes mr. martin .
here comes the principal .
we could only find four or five of these things , dave .
how many of them do you need ?
a lot more than that .
keep looking .
it' s all we can do .
okay .
dave , colonel spaulding got me through to washington .
they thought i was crazy at first , but they' re getting someone now .
hey , here come the kids !
our power' s still out , so we can' t do much in the way of refrigeration .
we think we' ve got it under control , but we won' t rest easy until it' s frozen solid .
now
no , it' s too big for that , and it' s impossible to cut it .
no , sir , a bomb would spread it all over the country .
look , this thing has killed probably 40 or 50 people since last night .
in a few hours , we' re gonna have the sun overhead .
i think you should send us the biggest transport plane you have ... and take this thing up to the arctic or somewhere where it' il never thaw out .
oh , daddy !
oh , daddy !
let me see you , son .
let me see my boy .
nice work , steve .
you okay ?
yeah , i' m okay .
dave , listen , i wanna
well , i wanna thank you for getting us out of there .
you know , for a while , i didn' t think we were gonna make it .
that makes two of us .
what are they gonna do with that thing , dave ?
well , the air force is sending a globemaster in .
they' re flying it to the arctic .
it' s not dead , is it ?
no , it' s not .
just frozen .
i don' t think it can be killed .
but at least we' ve got it stopped .
yeah , as long as the arctic stays cold .
