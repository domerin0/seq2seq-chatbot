polite thing to do .

ister gay ?
yeah , it' s a mystery .
we need you to solve it .
dreamcatcher .

i didn' t say anything .

sir ?
i see it .

we' re dying .
there is no infection here .
whose radio is that ?
it' s not the radio .
they' re putting it into our heads .
we are helpless .
there it is , gentlemen .
there' s no infection here .
directly into our heads .
this gives you an idea what we' re up against .
if anybody' s thinking , " those poor , helpless little folk ... ... all naked and unarmed beside their crashed intergalactic winnebago ... ... what kind of a dog , what kind of a monster ... ... could hear that heartbreak and go in just the same ?
well , i' m that dog .
i' m that monster .
we are helpless .
we are dying .
these mothers are as harmless as a fox in a henhouse .
and i' m here to kick some ass !
are you with me ?
yes , boss !
roger that , boss .
right on , boss .
don' t hurt us .
i have a visual .

blue boy group , this is blue boy leader .

don' t hurt us .
please , don' t hurt us .
there is no infection here .
we are helpless .
fire at will !

owen , get them out of there !

blue boy group , withdraw at once .
i repeat , cease firing and back off !

blue boy group , get out of there !
we' re on top of it !
owen , pull out now !
pull out !

pull out !
jonesy , i' ve been thinking about our friend .
our scooby doo buddy .
for a long time i thought he was sent to us to warn us about something .
i could never figure what it was .
don' t talk about him .
not till today .
it was this , right now .
he wanted to warn us .
go ahead , pete .
tell me about your friend .
did he show you that nifty trick ?
no .
jonesy' s right .
come on , pete .
let' s talk .
bite my bag , motherfucker !
all right , pete , i' il bite .
your bag and everything else .
no , no !
you bastard !
no !
pete .
don' t talk to him !
get out of there !
what' s up ?
thank god you came by , governor .
i' m broke down here and fearing for my life .
that' s a good looking dog .
where you headed ?
gosselin' s .
any chance you' re going near there ?
that' s where i' m going .
well , i believe your tailgate has come open .
let' s take a look .
i see you have some cargo you' re taking to blue base .
got a treat for you , ike .
all you can eat .
eat all the red stuff .
good doggy .
yes .
good boy .
have your fill .
tasty , tasty .
eat all you want ...
jonesy .
what are you up to ?
jonesy !
oh , god !
halt or we' il fire !
you cannot leave the quarantine zone !
halt !
i think i just about halted here .
come with me , owen .
i' il show you things you' il wish you' d never seen .
how long we gotta be here ?
it' il be all right .
i demand to see my lawyer !
there must be something they can do .
don' t worry , you' il be fine .
when do we get out ?
within hours .
you can' t do this to people in america !
i told you to stay over there !
my wife ...
government' s doing everything they can ... ... to get you out of here .
please don' t worry .
it' s all right .
we' re doing everything to make sure you' re safe .
we' il get you back to your homes within hours .
all clear .
can i help you , sir ?
what' s your name ?
henry .
dr. henry devlin .
a doctor ?
good .
we need doctors in there .
come on , laddie , i' il buy you a cup .
you , sir , where you from ?
boston .
beantown ?
great city .
we' il have you back there in no time .
maybe by morning .
hurry up , bucko .
you see that crud on the faces of children ... ... you know why i relish a turn in the country like we had today .
you were excellent out there , o.
it made me feel very proud to ...
abe ?
abe , you okay ?
abe ?
yeah , i' m fine .
i' m fine .
i must be getting too old for this shit .
i don' t know what the hell that was about .
it' s the only way , owen .
we' ve got to cauterize the site .
they' ve all got to die .
it' s the only way .
but we don' t know that .
the studies point to the strong possibility of recovery for many exposed subjects .
the studies show squat , that' s what they show .
if matheson had been in my spot for the last quarter century ... ... you' d have never made it to your first jerk off .
those gray bastards would have had you for lunch back in armpit , kentucky .
some get better .
at least half will be over it in a few days ... which ones , mother teresa ?
can you guarantee they won' t take it home like a present for the family ?
i' il tell you what you should be worried about .
what should be on your mind .
not these few unfortunates .
what you should be worried about is a hitchhiker .
what ?
a hitchhiker .
our greatest fear is that a grayboy would catch a ride ... ... with somebody and would carry them out of here , without being consumed .
to scatter the infection , like johnny fucking appleseed .
are you sure there isn' t such a person ?
no .
but i am sure that if there is one he won' t get out .
not with the net my boys put up around the blue zone .
and if we do a thorough job on the ones we' ve got .
if we don' t get gooey about the little picture when our job is taking care of the big one .
capisce ?
owen , if you think this is easy for me , you' re crazier than my mother was .
those poor schmucks .
they drive chevrolets , shop at wal mart ... ... never miss an episode of friends .
these are americans .
the idea of slaughtering americans ... ... it just turns my stomach .
but i' il do it .
i' il do it because it needs to be done .
so if we start at 2 , we can be done by 2 : 30 .
and it' s all behind us .
except for the dreams .
yeah , except for them .
what are you gonna tell rita about what you did here ?
what are you gonna tell katrina when she' s old enough to ask ?
you know me , don' t you ?
i don' t remember when we met , but you know me .
we don' t have time to screw around .
you' ve got two problems .
one you know about , one you don' t .
go ahead .
your mentor , colonel curtis , he' s gone insane from hunting aliens for 25 years .
now he wants you to help him kill hundreds of innocent people .
who are you ?
me ?
talk about that later , once we get out of here .
you' re predictable .
you won' t let me burn on this fence ... ... any more than you' il help curtis kill those people .
what you' re thinking now is whether that digital sat scan transmitter ... ... in your duffle bag will let you get through to somebody .
somebody named general matheson .
sometimes we have to kill , but our real job is to save lives .
your father was a great soldier .
those were his last words .
you carry his picture with you always .
tell me everything .
you' il save these people .
when we' re done talking , get on the transmitter , contact matheson .
cavalry rides in .
that takes care of problem number one .
now comes the hard part .
you think the infection' s been contained , that there' s no hitchhiker .
you' re wrong .
he' s riding with my best friend on earth .
a guy named gary jones .
and he' s out there .
you and i don' t get after him right away , he' il get out of my range ... ... and some kind of shit is gonna hit the planetary fan .
our nightmare hitchhiker .
and all dr. mystery wants is a free pass so he can catch his friend .
very convenient .
i' m saying you ought to hear his story .
okay .
where is he ?
had him taken to the tractor shed .
okay .
i' il check him out and we can compare notes .
whatever you say , boss .
come on , come on .
time' s a wasting .
all right , lad , open up .
dr. boston ?
are you in here ?
i' m here .
where i' ve been put .
a prisoner on my own damn property .
let' s go !
come on , let' s go .
get in !
you almost ran me down .
figured you' d read my mind and get out of the way .
blue unit , stand down .
you are under regular army command .
put down your weapons at once .
your mission is rescinded .
this is no longer a blue unit operation .
put down your arms .
repeat , put down your arms .
general matheson has assumed command .
okay , owen .
okay .
you just drove over the curtis line .
where we going ?
south .
all i know right now .
just get me in range of jonesy ... ... we' il know everything we need to know .
that' s some gun .
can i have a look ?
kind of flashy for a guy like you , isn' t it ?
it' s a gift .
i know .
where are you , jonesy ?
pick up the phone .
call 1 800 henry .
hello ?
jonesy !
jesus christ , i knew it was you .
where' s he taking you ?
massachusetts ?
he is ?
duddits ?
okay , i will .
you hang in there , jonesy .
jonesy ?
he hung up .
give me back my gun .
we gotta go to derry .
that where they' re going ?
no , they' re going towards massachusetts .
we need duddits .
jonesy says mr. gray is afraid of duddits .
your buddy , he' s still alive after all this time with mr. gray ?
yeah , he' s immune .
i think it' s because he died .
he got hit by a car and his heart stopped .
twice .
i don' t think he even knows it .
he came back from the dead .
must have changed him somehow .
it' s almost like duddits saw this whole thing coming .
is that it ?
jonesy told me it was duddits who drew him into the accident .
if we catch him , we' re gonna have to kill him .
you know we have to do it .
it' s the only way to stop mr. gray ... ... assuming we can catch him .
when was the last time you saw duddits ?
long time ago .
years .
what makes you so sure he can help ?
duddits can do anything .
i didn' t understand that then , but i think it' s always been true .
he' s the one who made us like this .
like what ?
you know , weird .
he' s been waiting for you .
blizzard slowed us up .
henny , henny .
henny .
i miss you , henny .
i miss you .
henny .
long time , henny .
my god , roberta , what is it ?
lymphocytic leukemia .
i' m gonna let you take him , but i have to tell you why .
just now , when he was getting ready ... ... henry he was so excited .
like he hasn' t been in such a long time .
i think ... ... that if he' s with you , he might die happy ... ... instead of in this awful room .
be sure the parka stays on tight .
cold devastates him .
the medication and instructions are in here .
bye , mom .
goodbye , duddie .
be a good boy .
now , go save the world .
i' m all right , laddie .
they haven' t got enough courage to take my trailer .
not yet , anyway .
what' ve we got ?
they' re leaving derry , maine , heading south on 95 .
toward massachusetts .
massachusetts ?
stay with it , bucko .
general matheson .
come in , please .
this is very nice , abe .
been home through some rough times .
was there something we hadn' t covered ?
i don' t think i got to say before how much i respect the work you' ve done .
it was with sincere regret ...
herman ...
may i call you herman ?
i' m past it .
burned out .
just needed a push , that' s all .
should have quit after that mess in montana .
even i don' t trust my judgment anymore .
oh , yeah ...
my techies tell me we' re getting some electronics reading hot from in here .
yes , i' ve been talking to the wife on my sat phone .
i don' t know if you' ve ever met barbara .
she' s been after me for years to retire .
she' s very happy , i can tell you that .
i' il have everything shut down in an hour .
if that' s soon enough .
that will be fine .
how do you turn off the goddamn lights ?
maybe you shouldn' t have been so fast to kill that trooper .
you' re making yourself at home .
you have no idea , jonesy .
maybe you shouldn' t have been so fast to kill that trooper . " not bad ?
oh , don' t like that , gary , do you ?
ownzy .
he' s in a police car now .
he' s in a police car now .
can you see where they are , duds ?
ownzy .
he' s in ister gay .
mr. gray .
that' s right , duds , he is in mr. gray .
ister gay " is mr. gray .
we gotta save this girl .
save the world ?
not the world , duds , a girl .
we' il save the world some other time .
ister gay ?
you already knew .
where' s he going , duds ?
where is mr. gray taking jonesy ?
ister gay , he want war .
war ?
not war , water .
mr. gray wants water .
i know where he' s going .
he' s going to the quabbin reservoir .
what' s quabbin ?
it supplies drinking water for all of boston .
what ?
one worm kills the world .
one worm kills the world ?
oh , my god .
one worm .
back at our cabin , i saw the worms that come out of these weasels .
mr. gray must want to get one into the boston drinking supply .
just one worm infects the whole world ?
are we going right ?
yes .
take the 495 to the mass pike .
it' s not far .
you' re doing great , buddy .
now , are you ready to try something hard ?
i want to ask you something hard .
yes , henny .
good .
can you talk to jonesy ?
can you make him hear you ?
ownzy ... ... and ister gay .
duddits .
i knew it .
i knew it .
he' s been here all along .
waiting .
jonesy ?
it appears we didn' t meet by accident .
we owe it to our friend , duddits .
i don' t know what you mean .
no ?
maybe not .
maybe your clever friend didn' t want you to know what he was up to .
that' s why you had nothing in the warehouse about me .
duddits didn' t bother to tell you what job he had in mind for you .
it doesn' t matter .
his little scheme didn' t work .
did it , ike ?
no , no .
we' re almost there .
what was it your poetry file had to say ?
i have promises to keep and miles to go before i sleep
and miles to go before i sleep
stop that chopper !
punch it , dude .
don' t be a pussy .
thank you , gary jones .
go up around the reservoir .
aqueduct to boston starts in shaft 12 .
patience , bambino .
just up ahead .
stay here and take care of your friend .
no matter what you hear .
so long , doctor .
good doggy .
good girl .
shit !
you son of a bitch !
wait .
wait .
go back to car , duddie .
you' il be safer there .
look out , jonesy .
i knew you' d come , henry .
i knew you wouldn' t let me die .
who the fuck are you ?
don' t you know me , h ?
i don' t know .
i think i' m gonna have to shoot you .
just to be sure .
well , maybe you' re right , my friend .
i don' t know myself if mr. gray is gone .
he could be hiding in here somewhere ... ... waiting for his chance .
tell me something mr. gray couldn' t possibly know .
tell me something only we would know .
ssdd .
not good enough .
well , you decide .
ask me anything .
at tracker brothers , day we met duddits ... ... what was painted on the wall by the window ?
no ...
... bounce ...
no play .
hello ... ... ister gay .
you .
ooby ooby doo ... ... we got some work to do now .
ister gay ... ... go away .
no !
i duddits .
h ?
jonesy .
jonesy , if that really is your name ...
that' il be 50 small .
bullshit .
i duddits .

we' re all best friends .
here' s to duddits , our dreamcatcher .
