with plenty of money and you may i help you ?

two years in the joint i waited for you .
and what did i get for it ?

denny' s kickin ' in six , tommy' s kickin ' in six , and i gotta put in my six .
where are those bums gonna get that kind of stake ?
they' re not bums .
maybe they didn' t go to harvard .

they never completed kindergarten because they were drafted .
you' re such a snob , frenchy .
for god' s sakes !
denny' s not stupid ' cause he drives a truck .

she' s got an answer for everything .

i' m not spending our last few bucks !
i got my end .
i told you i could match you .
you overmatched him .
he can' t get his end .
frenchy , i' ve gotta have that money !
for a heist ?
pass .
maybe if you needed a quadruple bypass .
this is a brilliant thing !
no , ray really is a genius !
compared to you this chair is a genius .
this is a plan of a great mind .
this is precise , mathematical .
it' s hard to believe you' re just a dishwasher .
thank you .
i don' t get your " agreeance " on this , i count to three , there' s gonna be trouble .
you can count to 53 !
i did a lot of nails for that money , and it' s all we got .
that' s what you want to do all your life ?
nails ?
take a hike , okay ?
i' m telling you , i' m countin ' .
oh , yeah ?
if i lose it , you' re gone .
oh , i' m quaking in my panty hose .
you' re embarrassing me in front of my friends .

i can' t have a cookie ?
what' s up ?
did you get your share ?
my share of what ?
yeah , i got it .
i sold some stuff .
what' d you sell ?
a rented car .
he can' t get his end .
she won' t give it to him .
i can get my end !
the candy didn' t work ?
you said you' d have her eatin ' out of your hand .
will you shut up ?
all that' s missing from this guy is a piece of velvet and a pet mouse .
frenchy , gimme the money .
i wouldn' t invest our last six thou if you had a legit idea ... much less something that' s gonna land the three of you jerks back in stir .
you said you called the shots around here .
will you knock it off !
frenchy , that money' s mine .
it' s mine .
i earned it , and i' m saving it for an emergency .
but i' m your husband .
oh , take a hike .
frenchy , i' m gonna get violent !
please !
with your hernia ?
fellas , i can' t do it .
it' s over .
forget it .
you said you' re the boss .
stop telling me what i said , for crying out loud !
it' s over .
let the bank lay there .
let someone else do it .
i gotta get some air .
i' m going up on the roof .
don' t jump !
you' re too valuable as a dishwasher .
ah , knock it off !
frenchy , can i have another cookie ?
no !
i want one .
all right , tell me your idea .
i told you my idea .
you shot it down .
you gonna tell me , or are you gonna have a tantrum ?
for god' s sakes !
for some reason you' re always shooting down my dreams .
because you get the kind of dreams people get ... after putting opium in their brownies .
can i for one minute tell you about this bank ?
you' re not a bank robber .
you got a two year mandatory vacation that proved that .
what i' m not is a stickup man .
that' s all we proved .
when i hit that bank that time , we were inexperienced .
the whole group of us put on rubber masks .
they were all ronald reagan masks .
it was confusing .
i didn' t know who was who .
you' re lucky your lawyer knew the judge .
can i please tell you my idea , frenchy ?
i noticed a few weeks ago , a couple doors down from the bank , there' s a pizza joint that folded .
a little hole in the wall .
and it' s for rent , frenchy .
it' s for rent .
then it hits me .
and , believe me , i' m no genius .
you don' t have to sell me .
what i figure is , we tunnel under .
we take the pizza joint , tunnel under , we come up under the vault of the bank .
i know the layout ' cause i used to know a guard .
i got diagrams !
we clean out the vault , we go to florida .
ray , we' re poor but we' re happy , ain' t we ?
we' re not happy .
you' re always complaining .
are you happy doing cuticles ?
is that the way you want to spend your life ?
my mother told me .
she said , " don' t get involved with a guy from the rackets .
what' s wrong with you ?
we had dreams .
i don' t know what' s gotten into you .
did we not have dreams when i first met you ?
yeah .
yes , granted , i was in the rackets .
i was running numbers .
you were an exotic dancer .
we fell in love , your parents didn' t approve .
i tried to go legit .
i couldn' t make a go of the pet cemetery .
what do you want me to do ?
but , but
frenchy , this pizza place is just waiting for us .
it' s gonna look suspicious , a group of guys drilling in an empty store .
that' s where you come in .
you front the place .
what ?
you front it .
you make pizzas .
with what ?
i can' t cook pizzas .
cook cookies !
what' s the difference ?
or you tell fortunes .
you look like a gypsy .
or make it a travel agency .
you work there , and we' il tunnel under into the bank .
god .
frenchy , come here , come here .
see this ?
see how beautiful this is ?
yeah .
see what you' re seeing there ?
it' s not just new jersey .
when we first met , there was a sunset just like this .
remember that ?
yeah .
in new jersey .
but in columbia there was an earthquake .
sorry , but the location was taken by someone else .
what ?
they made a deal yesterday .
i told you , if you waited too long
who did ?
who took the place ?
gimme you got the name ?
mrs. nettie goldberg .
jesus !
for what ?
i believe a flower shop .
a flower shop !
it' s a little old lady .
her husband died , and she wants to make the joint into a flower shop .
that don' t make no difference .
somebody' s got to get to her .
to get to her and what ?
beg her , con her , trick her .
i' m gonna go to her shop and threaten her .
you can' t threaten her .
that' s all we need  don' t do that .
i gotta figure a way to talk to her .
and say what ?
if her husband just died , what are you gonna say ?
you need a plan .
right .
i gotta figure something .
i' il charm her .
what are you gonna use for charm ?
knock it off .
we' re serious .
some master plan .
you don' t even have the lease .
i' m gonna get the lease .
that' s what this is about .
you guys are gonna rob a bank , and some old lady has the joint first .
what a hoot .
that' s very funny .
i' m gonna slam your head off .
jesus !
hey !
the bank isn' t even next to the pizza joint .
i told you that before .
that' s what' s great about it .
why ?
' cause there' s nothing suspicious .
the only thing suspicious is your sanity .
when did any of you guys dig a tunnel ?
it' s no big deal .
you really underestimate ray' s personality .
he' s one of the most likable dishwashers i' ve ever met .
don' t pay any attention to her .
we' re gonna proceed .

what do you mean ?
you' ve got your hat on backwards .
so ?

what about frenchy ?
what about frenchy ?
she' s just a front .
but without frenchy we' re dead .
we can get any broad to sell cookies .
jeez .
i say she gets a share , but not a full share .
i' d go for that .
what if we each get a fourth and she gets like a third ?
are you nuts ?
then she' d be getting more than us .
how do you figure ?
where you gonna get four fourths and a third ?
can' t you add ?
i don' t do fractions .
let' s not get greedy .
remember that movie with humphrey bogart ... when they' re diggin ' for gold in the mountains ?
they find the gold and they all get rich .
then this guy goes nuts and he turns on his friends .
let' s not let that happen here .
then he gets killed by hispanics .
what is it ?
the treasure of  treasure island .
treasure island !
that' s right .
that was a good movie .

i gotta put on help .
help ?
yeah .
i can' t handle the volume .
a second person you wanna put on ?
i can' t help it , ray .
the cookies are selling .
gee , i never counted on that .
you know , you gotta manage it somehow .
what about my cousin may ?
we can trust her .
may' s a dodo .
i' m gonna bring a dodo into a master plan ?
she' s not a squealer .
she' s not a squealer , but then we' d have to cut her in .
meanwhile , the pot' s getting smaller and smaller .
i can' t cook and sell at the same time .
it' s a madhouse .
we' il get caught .
hey , wait a minute .
you know what we could do ?
we could hire may and not tell her what we' re doin ' .
' cause she' il never catch on .
she' s got , you know and , and
we' re making enough dough from the cookies to pay her .
absolutely !
we give her a small salary .
she' il never figure out or catch wise to anything .
because if you think denny and tommy are slow , your cousin may is dumb like a horse , or dog or something .
well , maybe it' s not such a great idea .
no , i think we could do it .
where are we ?
right here ?
we' re supposed to be here .
excuse me .
where' s the sugar ?
frenchy wants more sugar .
may , stop bothering us .
we' re busy .
i just don' t understand about the drilling .
i told you .
business is good .
we' re expanding .
we' re expanding a little restaurant and tea shop ... so people could eat the cookies and drink tea .
ah .
where are they gonna drink the tea ?
in the tunnel ?
i' d explain it to you , but you gotta understand engineering .
what' s engineering ?
may , do me a favor , will you ?
business is good , we' re expanding .
that' s all you gotta know .
how can you expand ?
there' s a nail shop next door .
we made a deal with them .
so you' re expanding into the nail shop .
may , get your stuff .
you want the sugar ?
take a hike .
get the sugar and go .
we' il call you .
this broad' s big trouble .
i' m tellin ' you .
you think it' s safe having that strange broad here ?
don' t worry , she' s harmless .
i think we made a wrong turn .
i don' t think we' re still headed to the bank .
please .
gimme the map .
what are you talking about ?
for god' s sakes .
this is fine .
i don' t know what you' re all in a dither about .

we were just talking about what an instant success this place is .
yes .
i was telling him about the restaurant .
what restaurant ?
the tea room .
you know , the guys in the back tunneling for the tea room ...
under the nail shop ?
what are you talking about ?
the tea room in the back .
may , come and serve these people !
we' re at the sunset bake shop where the lines wait patiently ... for what some people are calling the most fabulous cookie treat in new york .
what the hell is goin ' on here ?
and you are the heart and soul of sunset cookies .
miss , uh  frenchy winkler .
my real name' s frances but everybody calls me frenchy .
as one stands here , one can inhale the aroma ...
my god ! of hot chocolate , cinnamon , fresh cherries and a dozen other mouthwatering taste treats .
is it true customers wait on line for half an hour for a single cookie ?
that you' ve had to ration sales ?
yeah , it happened like once .
but what' re you making all the fuss about ?
tell us .
where did you learn the rare secret of your baking ?
well , i don' t know .
it' s the only thing i can cook .
that and linguini with turkey meatballs .
sir , how would you describe your cookie ?
oh , i don' t know .
it' s baked with nutmeg or something .
i just know it' s great .
and i just want to say that we' re expanding .
there are men in the back now tunneling  no , no , may !
get back
i can' t take this , frenchy .
we don' t want this kind of attention .
don' t look at me !
i didn' t hire a publicity agent .
they just showed up !
i know , but it' s really putting us in the toilet .
i can' t concentrate .
there' s people up there . demanding cookies every day .
and today denny got bit by a rat .
we had to give him rabies shots .
who , the rat ?
very funny .
you should be on tv .
i am !
open your eyes !
frenchy , i don' t like this .
come on !
you' ve been digging for weeks !
when you gonna get somewhere ?
how much longer is it gonna take ?
it' s complicated !
we keep getting lost .
the other day i was deep in the tunnel , my hat went out .
that stupid coal miner' s hat ?
that' s right .
it' s a lifesaver , that hat .
that bulb .
we' d have done better just with a cookie store .
we' re making good dough . " making good dough . " it' s a cookie store , but we' re making dough .
that' s very it' s a cookie store .
we' re making dough
i get it , i get it .
i knew we were going the wrong way .
i knew it !
what the hell we doin ' in a dress shop ?
your fault , you got the maps .
at least it' s a sunday .
we can patch this up and get out of here .
how we gonna patch it up ?
we tile it and we get out .
hello !
i' m not a tiler .
we don' t have any tiles .
where do you get cement in the middle of a dress shop ?
besides , brain , how are we going to close the hole and tile it ?
we' re inside the store .
how do we get out ?
well , you tile he' s got a point .
you can' t tile this from the other side .
no kidding .
no , you can' t .
this is very discouraging , guys .
i' m ready to pack this in .
everybody freeze !
hey , ray , your wife' s cousin talks too much .
sorry to spoil your expansion plans , fellas .
officer , listen to me .
we didn' t do anything yet .
yes , it' s true , we were gonna rob the bank .
but we screwed up everything , except for the cookie shop .
the cookie shop' s doing great for some reason .
you like the cookies .
let us forget everything we were gonna do and concentrate on the cookie store .
look , i' m not here trying to ruin anybody' s life , okay ?
then give us a break .
think i could get a little piece of the action ?
yeah .
i' m not opposed to paying off the cops .
it' s a standard business expense .
that' s the thing .
i don' t want you to think of it as a payoff .
i think i' m qualified to make what i believe ... is a major contribution to this enterprise .
my brother in law majored in business .
let us hear this contribution , all right ?
one word .
yeah ?
and that word is ?
franchise .
we got about 600 trucks .
and , you know , we' re all over the country , and canada .
we make a lot of different cookies .
whatever you want .
we got pistachio , pretzels .
we make chicken chip cookies , tuna mint .
virtually overnight , the winklers and their associates ... have gone from a small , modest mom and pop cookie shop ... to something approaching a baking empire .
this is where we package everything .
and what we do is
the cookies have a wonderful smell , a fresh smell .
and that' s all put on with a chemical spray .
we do that over here .
there' s no denying that he' s refreshingly down to earth ... for a corporate executive .
so offbeat , in fact , that sunset farms ... has captured the imagination of the public and the industry .
we wanted to find out what the competition thinks .
so we went to paul milton of american cookies .
the bottom line is , they make a really great product .
you have what the public wants , and everything else takes care of itself .
this is your office ?
this is pretty much where i operate .
frenchy decorated this place .
you can tell .
she' s got , uh , all her stuff here .
this is an antique , you know .
she says it' s , like , louis xlv or louis xv .
it' s , uh i don' t know how high the louises go , actually .
but it' s a top louis .
it' s one of the
frenchy stuck a tv in it , you know , because she' s got a creative
she' s a creative decorator .
it' s very original .
um , how much are you worth ?
oh , plenty , plenty .
i mean , how much ?
just between you and me .
a lot .
we' re worth a lot of dough .
whatever you see is antiques .
this thing here .
this if from
i don' t remember exactly .
it think it' s the renaissance or the magna carta or something .
but that' s where it' s from .
why did you decide to go into baking so late in life ?
well , frenchy , we found out , can make cookies .
the frenchy they' re talking about ,
and reigning culinary genius of sunset , hello . is frances fox , who happens to be the wife of the c. e. o.
so you made cookies your whole life , and everybody told you how delicious they were .
yeah .
i thought they were " b. s. ing " me , you know ?
really ?
yeah .
somebody gives you something they cooked , you always say you enjoyed it ... even if it makes you throw up afterwards , so , you know
in a day and age where everyone seems to have public relations handlers , it' s hard to imagine a corporate brain trust ... that is more direct and less image conscious than the group here at sunset farms .
in fact , each person we met seemed to be more eccentric than the last .
like tommy walker , the chairman of the board .
frenchy makes the best cookies in the world .
we' re very proud of her cookies .
what are your duties as chairman of the board ?
the board meets once or twice a week , and we take up important issues .
issues ?
yeah .
facts , problems .
things like that .
normal stuff .
what kind of problems does an overnight success like sunset farms face ?
what kind of problems ?
last week the toilet on the fourth floor wouldn' t flush .
it flushed , but the water kept coming to the top .
so the board voted on getting a plumber .
one of the architects of sunset farms ' unorthodox marketing strategy ... is the head of advertising , denny doyle , a former truck driver .
was it you who came up with the idea to advertise baked goods ... in playboy , penthouse and hustler magazine ?
i figured if a guy' s staring at a naked piece of tail , and he sees the breasts and legs , he' s gonna start to salivate .
it' s human nature .
so if he' s salivating , he turns the page and comes across a picture of , say , our pistachio cream cookies .
he thinks maybe that' s why he' s drooling .
you understand ?
it' s psychology .
it' s science .
it' s like pablo' s theory , you know , with the dog when he feeds him ?
pablo ?
pablo , with the dogs .
then there' s ex police officer ken deloach , vice president in charge of distribution .
and benjamin borkowski , vice president in charge of plant safety .
first thing i did was make sure the building was fireproof .
and lest they be accused of being a mostly male club ,
may sloan is in charge of public relations and also physical therapy .
i understand public relations .
but physical therapy ?
all the chocolate chips are put in the cookies by hand .
and that' s really hard on the back and leg muscles .
i do deep massage .
by the way , she' s also a vice president .
so there you have it .
a brief glimpse into a corporate culture ... that has industry leaders and management analysts all over the country ... scratching their heads , trying to figure out what sunset farms might try next .
if you' ve got something the american public wants , everything else falls into place .
or as we in television might say ,
there' s no accounting for the public' s taste .
okay , keep coming through with this stuff .
it' s better the way i had it .
darling , could you put the doll by the ceramic zebra ?
mrs. winkler ?
excuse me .
yes ?
you wanted to check the menu .
right .
stevens , could you bring that piece downstairs that mr. winkler hates ?
try it again next to the fireplace .
i want a lot of nuts and " crude ites .
what did we say for openers ?
oh , yes .
snails .
escargots , yes .
then the potato and truffle salad .
yes .
truffles , by all means .
but i hate those thin pieces .
when you shave it , go , go .
lay it on big time .
truffles are always shaved really finely .
naturally , i didn' t mean to suggest anything overdone .
right .
then we have poached sea bass in phyilo .
and spinach souffle , and salad , and dessert .
oh , and finger bowls .
there' s nothing being served that requires finger bowls .
well have ' em , ' cause you can never predict whose fingers will need a washing .
okay ?
did you rearrange this place again ?
all right , hold your water .
don' t tell me to hold my water .
every night it' s like walking into a strange house .
what is this thing ?
did i tell you to get rid of this ?
it' s a harp .
you got no flair , ray .
don' t tell me i got no flair .
nobody plays the harp .
what' s it doing in the middle of the living room ?
i like the visual sweep .
i don' t know what' s gotten into your head .
you' re so hoity toity all of a sudden .
my cookies pay for this , so turn it off .
what' s for dinner ?
and don' t tell me it' s sparrows on a bed of lettuce again .
' cause i wouldn' t care if i had anything on a bed of lettuce anymore .
they' re pheasants , and you ate ' em last week .
and i got bb' s .
remember i got bb' s in the mouth ?
i almost choked on a bb .
can i get a cheeseburger ?
is that possible ?
it' s the dinner party tonight !
oh !
great !
just when i got a lot on my mind .
your mind don' t hold a lot .
get dressed .
and don' t forget , it' s tuxedo .
i' m hungry .
i don' t wanna get dressed now .
you want a snail ?
you nuts ?
i' m gonna have a snail ?
come on !
you eat steamers .
a snail leaves a trail of scum in the yard when it walks .
not in france they don' t .
oh , jesus .
what happened to the turkey meatballs and spaghetti ?
that' s what i like .
have a potato and truffle thing .
that' il hold you till the company comes .
i don' t want truffles .
truffles got no flavor !
they' re subtle .
only pigs can find them .
you' re thinking of pearls .
they come in oysters .
that' s what that is .
take a hike .
you' re such an ignoramus .
that' s what i love about you .
pearls come in oysters .
ray , ray , ray .
please , don' t spoil my big night .
what' s so big about tonight ?
there' s important people coming from the arts , and i want to get on some of those boards .
hey , we donate , you' il be on the boards .
but i wanna be a patron .
what you wanna be is a socialite .
so what ?
is that so terrible ?
you know , when we talked about making it , we were gonna hit it big , move to florida , we were gonna swim , eat stone crabs .
well , we can get a place at palm beach .
palm beach is ritzy .
i wanna go to miami .
i wanna be at the dog track every day .
i just know i wanna be as far away from frenchy fox , the topless wonder , as i can be .
hey , you were beautiful as frenchy fox .
you' d come out .
remember " night train " ?
you' d give it a little of this , a little of that .
those days are over , ray .
our accountants want us to expand .
we' re gonna be twice as big next year .
what good is being twice as big if i can' t get a cheeseburger ?
what' s it all mean ?
ray , please , be charming tonight .
i' ve seen you when you want to turn on the charm .

i gotta go take a shower .

tony gwynne , the outfielder with the padres ?
our goal is to raise 2 million by april .
then the company can tour the west coast and include the new opera ,
which has gotten such good notices .
right .
count me in .
i love serious music .
ray , on the other hand , opera freaks him .
have you tried your finger bowl ?
the guy says to him , " what do you do for a living ?
he says , " i' m a momback .
what' s a momback ?
he says , " i stand behind a truck .
i say , momback , momback .
he stands behind the truck and goes , " momback , momback .
he says i think it' s too fast for her . " momback .
he says , " momback .
i' m afraid i do think they overpaid for the picasso .
for me it was unusually mediocre , don' t you think ?
i agree completely .
banal .
excuse me .
i have to find my wife .
i saw a beautiful painting of fruit at the , uh , met or the whitney .
it might have been the holocaust .
are you affiliated with any of the museums ?
no , i' m a private dealer .
oh .
we have one or two paintings , but i haven' t really gotten around to building a collection yet .
uh huh .
so what are you interested in ?
what' s your
rembrandt .
picasso .
michelangelo .
you know , the boys .
yeah , yeah .
i might be out of michelangelos at the moment .
but i did recently come into possession of an incredible damon dexter ... that someone' s trying to sell .
i don' t think i' m aware of him .
no .
well , he' s new , you know .
i have to say , your wine is absolutely delicious .
really .
it was chosen by the same chef who did the finger bowls .
have you rinsed ?
david used to be part owner of a vineyard , so he' s a tough audience .
did you study art at school ?
no , i didn' t .
i often think i should have .
i studied literature .
then inevitably wound up as a stockbroker .
then i dropped out , went to japan , became a buddhist , blah , blah , blah .
and then , yeah , i did teach art at amherst for a bit .
and then the vineyard .
my god , what a life !
and you' re still so young .
yes , well don' t let the face fool you .
somewhere in a closet there' s a portrait of me aging .
in the closet ?
why would it be in
oh !
how droll .
you hear about the polish car pool ?
every day they' d meet at work .
i can' t believe this room .
i don' t know
this takes bad taste to new heights .
this is excruciating .
can you believe the two of them ?
i can' t keep a straight face .
and what she' s done with this apartment ?
the sheer flawless vulgarity of it all !
she must' ve been frightened by a leopard .
don' t knock it .
they plan on being very generous , and for that we must be thankful .
really ?
and what about the harp ?
not to mention the way she wears her clothes .
the definition of bad taste .
oh , i' d say so .
i never saw so much jewelry .
it makes me sad , frenchy , that i don' t have to steal anymore .
really .
what' s the matter ?
you' ve been quiet all night .
what is bothering you ?
what' s bothering me is we got no class .
speak for yourself .
i was very charming tonight .
i was killin ' them with jokes .
i got a little drunk from the wine , so i went to sit down in the bar .
some of them were in there talking about us .
you should' ve heard ' em .
and they were right .
stop it !
we got more dough than all of ' em put together .
well , it ain' t dough .
it' s knowing the finer things .
like what ?
opera ?
like food and wine , and painting , and books .
stop it , will ya ?
i' m unimpressed .
all my life i' ve been ignorant .
i could never afford to learn anything .
there was always some emergency , and i was a good student .
i was a lousy student and i always hated school .
and i don' t care about it .
if i could find my school principal today , now that i got some dough ,
i' d put a contract out on her .
class is something you can' t fake and you can' t buy .
i got more class in my little finger than they all got combined .
no .
we came into a couple of bucks , but we' re phonies .
we' re trying to act like big shots .
not me !
well , me .
but it' s over .
the time has come to use our dough to amount to something .
like what ?
to change our lives .
i' m too busy to change my life .
doin ' what ?
playing pinball ?
i don' t wanna wear a tux anymore .
i don' t like it .
i wanna go to florida and swim .
i wanna be the real thing !
and you better wise up , ' cause if i grow and you stay as stupid as you are , we' re gonna have big problems , ray .
smarten you up .
is that what you said ?
yeah .
you said you were a teacher .
you know art , opera , books , wine .
we wanna learn it all , don' t we , ray ?
i' m incredibly flattered that you' d think i was capable of
turning two slugs like us into classy items ?
no homework .
i' m not doing any .
i never did homework when i was young .
i' m not doing anything that' s got homework to it .
naturally , we would make it very worth your while , david .
no , it' s absolutely not about money .
i suppose it' s just
i don' t know .
i' ve never been asked to do anything like this before , and i' m not sure i' d know where to start .
i know i gotta get a better vocabulary .
have you ever thought about enrolling in college ?
college ?
i didn' t go to high school .
what the hell am i gonna go to college for ?
that takes four years .
we want a private crash course .
lessons in life .
right , ray ?
am i crazy ?
she' s nuts .
tell her she' s nuts .
what ?
i' m gonna learn about life suddenly ?
i must say , frenchy , ray has a point .
he could probably teach me a lot more about life than i could ever teach you .
what the hell is he gonna teach you ?
i can figure the point spread .
i know how to count cards at a blackjack table .
would you close your bazoo ?
i can count four jacks  close your bazoo !
i don' t want to be discouraging because what you' re proposing is admirable .
it' s amazing .
the one thing i would like .
i would like to learn how to spell connecticut .
don' t ask me why .
i never knew how to spell connecticut .
fair enough .
great !
you could teach him that , right ?
yeah .
i heard you telling somebody this is a very slow period in the art market .
and we would take very good care of you , right ?
like i say ,
i absolutely don' t want to discourage you .
i suppose i just have to think about it a bit .
i haven' t
if i could envisage a plan , some kind of starting point
we could start by building our art collection .
that way you' d make a few bucks , and we can learn something .
but no museums .
i' m not goin ' to museums .
the pictures ... spook me out .
the virgins
what are you laughin ' at ?
spooked by the virgins .
i' m sorry .
work on the laugh , frenchy .
so , you can see the difference between this tintoretto ... and the earlier byzantine painting we looked at .
what would you say is the most significant difference ?
me ?
i would say that the frame' s bigger here .
mm hmm .
well , it is bigger .
but there' s also a difference in the paintings themselves , isn' t there ?
and it' s an important difference because it characterizes ... the great technical leap from the ancient into the modern world .
you remember how those saints had very flat faces ... and the background was on the same plane as the foreground ?
perspective .
right , perspective .
that' s it .
let me show you another very good example of that .
the frame on this one is bigger " ?
boy , you are a dummy .
don' t give me " perspective .
take a hike .
take a hike .
twenty eight .
four .
fifty one .
levoxyl .
u ni ty con .
eighty seven .
ninety ... four .
darvocet .
red du tem puh .
i' m hungry .
can we get outta here ?
you' re always hungry .
why don' t you try and learn something ?
there' s nothing to learn .
interesting fact .
this is where henry james lived .
who ?
the bandleader , stupid .
married to betty grable ?
i knew that .
no , you' re thinking of harry james the trumpeter .
henry james married to grable .
henry james , the author .
yeah ?
oh .
this is where he lived and where he worked , and
where did he eat ?
i' m hungry .
i don' t care where he lived .
i remember .
the hair ess , right ?
the " h " is silent .
oh , did he write that too ?
oh , gee .
frenchy , i' m still sick .
i' m weak .
i' m weak .
i can' t go .
you' re gonna miss a very interesting " great books " discussion .
i know .
it kills me .
it just kills me .
but i' m just gonna lay here .
i' il see you when you come back .
how are you ?
hello .
ray' s got a cold .
i bet 500 .
five hundred ?
see your five , raise you 500 .
i' m outta here .
i see the five ... and a thou .
what' d you think of the book ?
well , i thought it was very romantic .
i mean , he loved her but their backgrounds were so different .
right .
so , what ?
you thought he was doomed from the start ?
i guess , ' cause he wound up dead .
but , uh , i think that two people from different backgrounds can make it ... if , uh , the juice is there .
right .
sorry .
juice is  you know , the hots .
right .
wine .
would you like some wine ?
i brought over a bottle of chateau margaux .
ah , that' s brilliant , because we can compare that to my clos de la roche ... and you can see the difference between a bordeaux and a burgundy .
i' ve got two other burgundies of the same vintage ... that i thought might be fun for us to try .
i' il see your five and raise you a thou .
i' il see it and raise you a thousand more .
and a thousand .
and a thousand .
okay .
call .
read ' em and weep .
a pair of threes .
oh , good .
i thought you were bluffing .
what do you want to play now ?
what about indian poker ?
seven cards .
you hold your cards over your head .
nobody sees their hand .
we bet on each other' s hand .
high low , maybe some wild cards .
all the reds .
wanna sit down , may ?
how about old maid ?
do you play old maid ?
so , um ... try this one .
okay .
nice nose .
yeah .
the bouquet is very special .
no , no .
i mean you got a nice nose .
me ?
yeah .
i don' t know how to describe it .
it' s like , kinda
it' s just any old nose , i think .
aquiline .
um , talking of which , how is your vocabulary coming along ?
oh , very good .
i' m almost through all the " a " words in the dictionary .
right , right .
the thing is , i' m not 100 percent convinced ... that memorizing the dictionary is the best way to improve your vocabulary .
hmm .
i can' t believe you found a buyer for the damon dexter so fast .
and at such a good price .
it' il really take a bite out of our debts .
oliver , it' s dawning on me that the opportunity has arisen ... for me to become quite obscenely rich .
how serious are they about building an art collection ?
that would be peanuts .
what , then ?
well , i think that she might be falling for me .
frenchy winkler ?
how much do you think she' s worth , roughly ?
her husband you mean .
no , it' s all in her name .
she' s the cookie mogul .
what are you saying ?
i don' t know .
i suppose i' m saying ... people grow and marriages sadly break up .
and women remarry , you know ?
fortunes , they change hands .
what is this ?
it' s a damon dexter , a discovery of david' s .
i say it' s depressing .
knock it off .
you wouldn' t know a masterpiece if it bit you in the ass .
i refuse to look at this , frenchy .
what is that supposed to mean ?
it means as long as this is on that wall , i don' t look at that wall .
you' re a head case !
i' il bet david made a big profit on this .
hey , whose cookies pay the rent , huh ?
i think he' s making a fool outta you .
stevens , come here .
tell me what time it is .
i no longer look at this wall .
11 : 00 a . m . , sir .
thank you very much .
david , what' s this ?
oh , well , that' s a citrine necklace .
you know about citrines ?
no .
they' re not one of the precious stones .
but the luster' s always been considered very special and unique .
and that ?
look !
ah , yeah .
well , if we' re talking about luster , this is something very special and i' d imagine very , very expensive .
it' s a cigarette case encrusted with diamonds that belonged to the duke of windsor .
i know the duke of windsor !
yeah ?
he also married beneath his station , right ?
he did , like our friend henry higgins .
yeah , yeah .
oh , my god , the duke and duchess .
it was such a romantic story .
i saw it on television .
uh huh ?
ray ?
ray !
what are you doin ' here ?
i' m havin ' chinese food .
that' s what they serve in a chinese restaurant .
you want some company ?
who ?
what do you mean ?
me .
who' s talkin ' to you ?
well , where' s frenchy ?
frenchy' s at some piano concert with a guy .
oh .
well , they
they have takeout here , but i don' t think they' il deliver to a concert .
don' t worry about it , may .
frenchy' il eat .
dinner was so great !
you know ?
all that m. s. g. and the grease .
it was what a treat !
i' m so sick of continental food every night .
frenchy eats frogs ' legs !
it' s supposed to taste like chicken .
rabbit .
rabbit tastes like frogs ' legs ?
no .
forget it .
are you happy being rich ?
it' s okay .
i got a lot of charge accounts and a really nice apartment .
i got a maid .
i' m still a little lonely , though .
yeah ?
how come ?
that guy i was seeing left me ... because he just was so embarrassed about being poor .
and he hated that i' d pay for everything .
so then i stopped paying .
and actually , that' s when he left me .
i can understand your  you enjoy being rich ?
i hate it !
you' re kidding ?
no , i hate it .
i' m telling you .
i hate the life .
and it' s causin ' me to lose frenchy .
what do you mean ?
i mean , she' s outgrowing me .
that' s just what she said .
she' s like a different person now .
i think she' s developing a crush on her teacher david .
yeah .
well , you know , he' s very good looking , and he' s bright and very charming and very elegant .
okay , may , i got the picture .
it' s all right .
you know , my god , you really know how to make a guy feel good .
well , when you' re right , you' re right .
thank you .
what did you think of her playing ?
i just gotta tell ya , i thought the whole evening was apocalyptic .
apocalyptic ?
really ?
yes !
i really was agog .
well , me too .
i mean , she' s fabulous .
she' s fabulous and i have to asseverate , she deserves accolades .
frances , you' ve been memorizing the dictionary .
yeah , i got the " a' s .
next week the " b' s .
right ?
how do i look ?
i have to say that that dress is just ... gorgeous on you .
see ?
your influence .
low key , right ?
that' s a very flattering thing to say .
ray thinks it' s dullsville .
david ?
page !
wasn' t her choice of the rachmaninoff inspired ?
wasn' t it ?
we loved it .
at first i thought it might incur my animadversion .
but soon i realized it was apposite .
aha , i think i see drinks .
good to see you , david .
nice meeting you .
thank you very much .
i love your friends , david .
they' re so bright and cultured and refined .
it' s another world .
well , it' s a world i know you' d love to belong to .
ah , this looks a lot more civilized .
beautiful .
let' s take a seat over here .
anything we get , cody' s in for his full share .
that' s how it is .
you know why i respect cody jarrett ?
why ?
because he loves his mother .
i can understand that , may .
because even though he' s a vicious , coldblooded , psychopathic killer , and she encourages him , still it' s sweet .
yeah , has a sweetness .
i wish i had a mother like that .
more pepsi ?
yeah , please .
and this is the best part , isn' t it ?
i love this part .
will you pass me the cracker jack ?
what is it ?
what are you looking at ?
i happen to be noticing you .
i was looking at you a couple of times tonight ,
' cause for the first time i had the thought ... that in a very strange way , you got a sweet face .
it' s offbeat , you know , in a kind of bizarre , you know
it' s i don' t know how to explain it exactly , but it' s right up there .
what do you mean ?
i mean it as a compliment .
i' m sayin ' a nice thing to you .
' cause you being a relative of frenchy ,
i never before classified you as a , you know , a human type female , so
i was married .
i know , i know .
this was a long time ago , right ?
it was a really tragic story .
my husband , otto , was dyslexic , and the only thing he could spell correctly was his name .
oh !
that is that' s
there' s no doubt about it .
the burgundy really goes to my head .
yeah .
what did you want to talk to me about ?
i' ve , um , i' ve got a little present for you .
for me ?
yeah .
here .
ohh !
pretty !
i love leather books .
oh , pygmalion !
i love that story , david .
there' s , um you see a little inscription there ?
to my favorite eliza , from your professor higgins .
love , david .
gee , i got a confession to make .
what ?
i got you a present too .
oh , no .
oh , no .
no , you didn' t have to do that .
it' s in appreciation of all the stuff you' ve been doin ' for me ,
' cause i know it' s a hard job .
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
frenchy !
this is
frances !
frances , this is
it must' ve cost you a fortune .
what good' s having dough unless you spend it , huh ?
well , i know , but this is so extravagant .
i' m embarrassed .
i' m not suggesting you take up smoking , but i figured , you know , what' s good enough for the duke of windsor , right ?
well , i' m really overwhelmed .
and i feel , you know , my little pathetic bernard shaw ...
is so insignificant by comparison to this .
no !
but you see , i just wanted you to know ...
how unbelievably proud i am of you .
this is not insignificant .
maybe i' m talking out of turn here , but ... you' ve just developed so much , and i just feel , you know , you belong in a world of society and high culture now .
it' s frustrating , because you should continue growing , you know .
you should be branching out , you should be traveling .
there' s paris and rome and the great opera houses and the museums , you know .
you should be in a position to cultivate the right kinds of friends .
anyway , i' m , you know , bif .
it' s hard , you know , ' cause ray' s not like that .
he likes to watch tv in his underwear , suckin ' a bud .
yeah .
well , that i don' t know what to say .
i can' t comment on that .
can i be frank , david ?
mm hmm .
sometimes i think i' ve outgrown him .
pretty late .
yeah , you too .
what did you do ?
i , you know , i worked late ... and then may and me had some chinese food .
you and may !
what' d you talk about over dinner ?
cartoons ?
are you kiddin ' ?
we went up to her apartment .
we watched white heat on television .
till 3 : 00 a . m . ?
no .
then we went out and we got a pizza .
chinese food and a pizza ?
with your stomach , i' m surprised you weren' t shot ... breaking into the pepto bismol factory .
no , frenchy , i had fun .
it was the first time in a long time i had a good time .
i want to talk to you , ray .
now ?
david' s going over to europe for a month .
i thought we might go along , see some sights .
what kind of sights ?
you know , churches , opera houses , ruins .
what are you , a stroke victim ?
i' m gonna fly 3, 000 miles to see opera houses and ruins ?
well , i wanna go .
what do you mean , you wanna go ?
it' s part of my cultural development .
will you knock it off ?
you' re frenchy fox from new jersey .
stop puttin ' on airs .
david thinks that it would be good for me to travel through europe .
i get a bad vibe about this guy .
because you' re a crook , so you think everybody is .
i wish i still was a crook , then i' d feel like an actual person again .
i warned you that this would happen if you didn' t grow along with me .
the only thing that' s grown about you is your rear end from too much french food .
i' m sorry , ray , but i wanna go to europe .
what do you mean ?
we' re married .
you can' t just go to europe with david .
i asked you to come .
' cause you knew i' d say no .
that' s why you asked me .
my idea of fun is not goin ' to operas and ruins .
i get enough sleep at home .
i never thought i' d be saying this to you , ray , but maybe the time has come to reevaluate our marriage .
if you go to europe with david , you' re gonna have to reevaluate it big time .
i' m going !
i won' t be held back mentally ... by some overaged juvenile delinquent .
then you better go get yourself a lawyer .
we don' t need lawyers .
i' il go fifty fifty with you even though it' s all in my name .
you' re right .
we don' t need lawyers .
exactly right , because
you don' t have to go fifty fifty .
i don' t want anything .
you can have the house , the business , custody of all the chocolate chips .
i just want out .
you know , may , it was on a boat that i first proposed to frenchy .
yeah , i know .
all of a sudden , i' m not her type after all these years .
may i tell you something ?
what ?
you' re not my type either .
what does that mean ?
what the hell does that mean ?
it means that maybe frenchy ... wasn' t so wrong to try and make something out of herself .
frenchy was nuts !
frenchy overdid everything .
you underdo everything !
you know , there' s more to life than turkey meatballs .
i don' t know what to say , may .
i get a bad vibe about this guy , david .
it' s my street instinct , but i just don' t trust him .
yeah , i know why .
because he' s younger than you are , handsomer than you are , he' s much taller than you are , he' s smarter than you are , he' s much more exciting than you are
may , don' t feel obligated to pull any punches with me .
i can take it .
you know , women like a little elegance .
it' s more romantic .
so if i had it to do over again , i would do some things differently .
maybe i' d sit through a couple of more operas with frenchy , especially now since they got the new sony walkmans .
now that you split up with frenchy , you don' t even work .
no , i don' t work , may , but i got an idea for something , and i wanna talk to you about it .
really ?
wow !
what a place !
that' s the home of chi chi potter , the socialite .
chi chi valezquez potter .
now , chi chi' s got a necklace .
it' s all emeralds with diamonds around it .
it' s a very famous necklace .
maybe you saw it in a magazine .
they photograph it all the time .
would it have been on television ?
l i don' t know .
but it' s been in magazines .
it' s a famous necklace .
i wanna go in there .
i could live off that necklace if i fence it for the rest of my life .
but you gotta remember what happened when you tunneled into the bank .
but that' s the beauty part .
we don' t have to tunnel anymore .
now , frenchy and i , we' re patrons of the arts .
so chi chi invited us to a big party there in a couple of weeks .
frenchy' s out of town .
you come with me , we get the necklace .
oh , uh , see , i never heisted anything before .
there' s nothing to it .
i know where the safe is .
because this has been on my mind for a while .
i had dinner over there one night , and i excused myself .
i was very crafty .
i went upstairs , and i checked out the place .
i scoped it all out , and i found the safe .
i got the whole layout in my mind up there , so i know we can do this .
i don' t wanna wind up in jail .
if this is wait .
if this is such a big item , then they' re gonna be turning the town upside down looking for it .
no .
that' s why you' re dealing with a particularly shrewd mentality .
i got a connection in chinatown .
i bring in a picture that i got from a magazine of the necklace .
he makes me an exact duplicate .
i switch .
she never knows what happened .
she' s , you know
chi chi' s a dumb , flighty society dame .
she' s crazy .
by the time she figures out there' s a switch , two years from now or something ,
i' il be in florida or the cayman islands .
hello ?
what ?
i can' t hear you .
what ?
shh .
i' m in a crypt !
i can' t  please .
what do you mean ?
what are you talking about ?
how ?
would you gimme a break , sister ?
okay ?
what ?
today ?
look , what do you mean it' s an emergency ?
oh , hi .
mrs. winkler ?
we' re so sorry to bring you back from your vacation .
what the hell' s goin ' on , fellas ?
i have terrible news .
something' s happened to ray ?
sunset enterprises is bankrupt .
how ?
fraud .
fraud ?
who ?
your accountants .
my accountants .
i don' t even know who they are .
what ?
you should' ve looked .
we let them handle everything .
what the hell do i know about running a corporation ?
did you ever read anything you signed ?
no , but they assured us everything was okay .
may i get you a drink ?
i' d like a 1961 romanee st. vivant if we have it .
i' d have a whiskey if i were you .
well , i don' t understand .
i mean , sunset' s gone ?
can' t we do anything ?
you might be able to put a few people in jail if we could find them .
oh !
this is the worst news .
oh , no , no .
mrs. winkler , it' s not .
no ?
well , it is to me !
no , no , no .
the worst news is coming up .
oh .
all right .
all right .
you better tell me .
let me sit down .
they spoke to you about expanding sunset .
that' s right .
we' ve been planning it for months .
yeah .
in order to do that , you needed a bank loan .
are you aware of that ?
quite a substantial loan .
get to the point .
they asked you to sign a promissory note to the bank .
you' re speaking to the wrong person .
this is what i got accountants for .
yes , but unfortunately your accountants are in venezuela .
wh this is all so confusing .
frances , you put up your home and savings as a note for a monster loan .
could you put a touch of cyanide in here ?
it needs to be stronger .
you' ve lost it all , frenchy .
or should i say , you' ve been swindled out of it all ?
you mean , i got  nothing .
mrs. winkler , you have nothing .
no house , no bank account .
just a couple of large , outstanding loans ... which we feel you can best deal with by filing for bankruptcy .
bankruptcy ?
bankruptcy ?
i' m not up to the " b " words yet .
sorry .
does ray know about this ?
what difference does it make to ray ?
he' s gone .
what did you say ?
i' m bankrupt .
sunset' s gone .
worse .
all my personal dough is gone .
the whole ride' s over .
well , how
i mean , how could that possibly happen ?
fraud .
my accountants .
oh , ray said not to trust them because the whole firm had mustaches .
i' m , i' m gonna get myself a little valium .
david , i' m not gonna be able to give you that loan i promised you .
what did you say ?
suddenly it turns out i got people i owe .
i know , but you did say that i could borrow400, 000 .
i was using it to cement a deal .
i know , and it kills me !
it kills me to cop out on you like this , but i' m busted .
i' m flat .
what an idiot .
i guess i am .
yeah .
how could you be so stupid and irresponsible ... as to allow some patently cheap , thieving accountants ... to defraud you out of a future ?
i just don' t understand how anyone could be that stupid .
aren' t you a little out of line ?
well , you know i' ve made plans .
i' ve made commitments to people .
wow .
you' ve got a strange look in your eye like the guy from the book .
dr. jekyil or mr. hyde or ted bundy .
i can never remember .
think of the time i' ve put in nurturing an idea that' s not gonna happen .
is that what it was ?
the money ?
i , i need i need my prescription .
i need my little blue pills .
so i' m gonna go and get them , and i would very , very much appreciate it if when i came back , you were gone .
thank you .
david , if you wouldn' t mind ,
i' d like the cigarette case back .
i don' t think so , my love .
wow .
i asked you for lessons in life .
i guess i really got one , right ?
oh , we' re so glad you could come !
how are you ?
good .
langston wants to talk to you about a theater project in aspen .
do you ski ?
me ?
no , never .
never .
do either of you play miniature golf ?
oh , there' s binky !
oh , hello !
oh , for heaven' s sake .
mingle .
i don' t think you should speak .
i don' t think you should say anything .
but you said make conversation .
i was just making it .
i know .
make conversation , but don' t talk .
don' t bring up anything .
maybe about the weather or something , but don' t you know .
now , i' m gonna get in the flow of things here and then i' m gonna glide upstairs .
should i glide with you ?
no , no .
i' il contact you .
can i get you some champagne ?
sure .
ray ?
i was ju i was gonna make a phone call .
have you seen edgar ?
edgar ?
where that man gets off to !
i was gonna make a phone
i' ve looked back here , and downstairs .
try back there .
i' il try that .
thank you .
oh , winkler ?
do you play golf ?
golf ?
no .
i was just gonna make a phone call upstairs .
i guess i was misdirected .
yes , well , i was gonna use the phone .
i' m sorry .
i wanted a match on sunday , but i' il get somebody else .
i would' ve looked forward to it .
there' il be rain over the tristate area and increasing fog .
temperatures will hover in the low 60s till tuesday .
i must say , you are most amusing .
would you like a canape ?
those are shrimp .
these are quail eggs .
i don' t have any idea what they are .
thank you .
i hate anything with a toothpick .
they lodge in your throat .
i' m george blint , mutual funds .
and you ?
may sloan .
i' m a lookout .
i noticed the way you walked and carried yourself from across the room .
you remind me of my wonderful , departed wife .
you can' t carry yourself across the room .
that' s physically impossible .
you' re charming .
you' re the first woman i' ve met since helen died that i could say that about .
was helen your wife , or just a woman who died ?
hi .
where' s mr. winkler ?
i want to talk to him .
oh , he' s around mingling .
cloudy today , wasn' t it ?
with a chance of light sprinkles followed by sunshine .
right .
chi chi , would you get those photographs from the bedroom ?
i wanna show mr. winkler the property in aspen where we' re gonna build the theater .
yes .
i just wanna talk to dr. henske .
he would be perfect to do beth kramer' s face work ... after the unbelievable job he did on mrs. morton' s buttocks .
oh , i' m gonna be right back .
will you just
ray ?
jesus !
you scared me .
for god' s sakes !
i came to warn you .
mrs. potter' s gonna come up here ... to get some pictures that mr. potter wants you to see .
she' s lookin ' for you .
now , i closed the safe !
this is a tough safe !
i' m outta practice .
i can' t
did they see you come up here ?
i , i don' t think so .
get out there and stand watch .
i' m gonna do this again .
are you okay ?
i' m fine , i' m fine .
get out !
get out !
if you could fit it into your schedule , it would mean so much to beth .
she' s been so down since the divorce .
and don' t you think ... he got custody of the polo ponies .
chi chi , don' t forget those photographs for mr. winkler .
where' d he go ?
i' il get them .
so , you will try ?
i' il do my best .
kiss , kiss .
whoops !
mrs. potter is coming .
she' s gone .
shh , not so loud .
but she' s gone .
she' s gone .
thank you , dear .
i want to show those to mr. winkler .
he wouldn' t leave without saying good bye , would he ?
i don' t know , he' s not upstairs .
jesus .
i met a wonderful man downstairs .
he seemed to like me .
he said i reminded him of his wife who' s dead .
but i assume he meant when she was alive .
may , can you stop talking to me while i' m doing this ?
little short fellow .
bright yellow shirt , unbelievable tie .
oh , yes .
i think i know the gentleman you mean .
he was going up the stairs before .
are you sure ?
yes .
mr. winkler .
ray , i hear something .
oh !
she' s not feeling well .
i took her up here .
yes , she' s had one of her spells .
spells ?
yes , she gets spells .
how extraordinary .
we have a doctor right here .
no , not necessary .
she gets these spells .
i' m a hemophiliac .
oh , dear god !
are you bleeding ?
why would i be bleeding ?
no , she her neck .
wasn' t your neck
it is , but my nasal passages are clearing up now .
i handle all this .
on weekends , i do this for a little hobby .
she had champagne .
poor darling .
i' il go get dr. henske .
really , i' m ray , you have my cortisone pills .
me ?
my medication ?
i will feel a whole lot better if i let dr. henske take a look at her .
no , no , you just relax , put your feet up , and i' il go get dr. henske .
a hemophiliac ?
cortisone ?
where did you come up with these things ?
it' s on tv .
the weather' s on tv .
i said stay with the weather .
i thought i did some really quick thinking .
yes , very quick .
meanwhile , you' re gonna be examined now .
why ?
i just had a checkup .
jesus !
i got no time to work here .
they' il be back in seconds .
i can' t tell the difference between these .
god !
then you better take ' em both .
i can' t take ' em both .
if they come back and don' t find any necklace here , we' ve been suspiciously seen in the bedroom .
i' il go right to jail .
especially with your d. n. a.
what does my d. n. a. got to do with it ?
you better make a choice , ' cause they' re gonna be back any minute .
ray , let' s go !
all i know is what i told you , doctor .
she' s right in here .
come along .
here' s dr. henske .
now , what seems to be the trouble ?
false alarm .
it was a hot flash .
i think it was a menopausal thing .
i' ve seen it before .
i' m given to occasional spells .
spells ?
well , not spells , but , you know , she was drinkin ' booze
no , no , sometimes for no good reason i get hot and cold flashes .
the room will begin to spin , then spots before my eyes , a ringing in my ears .
you' re making too much of it .
we should go .
little pinpoints of light and my tongue turns black , and i can' t swallow .
really ?
they diagnosed it as parkinson' s .
but they think it could be the ebola virus or mad cow disease .
we gotta get her out of here because , you know , it' s a false positive .
come , sweetheart , we' re due , we' re due .
i do hope you feel better .
and not to worry , mr. winkler , the theater in aspen will just have to wait .
the ebola virus or mad cow .
i just said the first thing that came into my mouth .
great .
i tried to do my best  hello again !
george !
do i still remind you of your wife ?
you kill me .
you' re great .
you' re not feeling well .
i' m taking her home .
she' s not feeling well .
i' m in the book .
may sloan .
i' il , i' il be better .
oh !
well , i' il call you .
ray , i just got the news about frenchy .
frenchy ?
didn' t you hear ?
sunset' s gone under .
she was defrauded out of every penny she owns and then some .
and i know you' re out of there , but i figured you' d know .
yeah , sure , i do know .
i , l , l
i came as soon as i heard .
i got exactly what i deserved .
i really missed you , frenchy .
i' m sorry i blew our cookie company , but i' m even more sorry i blew our marriage , ray .
what do you do ?
everybody makes mistakes , you know what i mean ?
the important thing is i still love you .
i don' t deserve it .
i behaved badly .
you behaved like an ass , but that' s one of those " a " words you used to practice .
ass .
but i' m not the easiest guy to get along with .
i' m not mr. sensitive .
there' s a lot of things i could' ve done differently , maybe .
we stayed in separate rooms the whole trip , ray .
that' s the truth .
so where' s david now ?
he split the second i went bust .
no !
i don' t believe it .
he was hustling me for the dough .
sure .
oh , jeez .
so now we gotta all begin again , you know .
and in more ways than one .
you still want me ?
still want you ?
i' m
frenchy , you gotta ask a question like that ?
i' m crazy about you .
i' m crazy about you too .
you' re a goddess to me .
i' m nuts for you .
you got of course i want you .
but we' re broke , you know .
we haven' t got a dime .
we don' t even own a stick of this furniture we' re sittin ' on .
can i show you something ?
will you sit here ?
may i show you one thing ?
can i show you just let me show you something .
okay .
i think you' re gonna be very , very proud of me .
what ?
that' s chi chi potter' s .
was .
was chi chi was .
keyword .
was .
i' m tellin ' you , i never felt so great .
i was back in action again .
i felt alive , you know .
' cause i always felt that you were keeping me with this whole cookie thing .
hey , this is glass .
what are you talking about , glass ?
how' s it glass ?
it' s fake .
what do you mean , fake ?
how the hell would you know ?
i can tell fake from real .
this ain' t even good fake .
what are you talking about ?
what do you mean , it' s fake ?
you know , it might fool some idiot with no eye or no brains , but it' d never pass with a normal person .
what are you you' re telling me that i got the phony one ?
i came away with the wrong thing ?
that sounds like your m. o.
you' re nuts !
i was in the room .
yeah .
and i was gonna substitute the glass one for the real one .
then everything got confusing .
it' s good to see you got the same great instincts .
you' re so wrong .
it really is .
you take all those lessons , you think you got taste .
wait a minute .
i' m gonna show you something .
you think you learn class and taste , but you know nothing about jewelry .
we take this and fence it .
we go to florida .
it' s the goods .
that ain' t gonna get us on the subway , much less to florida .
what ?
you know , you' re such a know everything .
you don' t have to be a rocket scientist to spot a clinker like this .
whoever made it for you , you overpaid .
what can i do if you' re wrong ?
what can i do ?
can i take your nose and twist it till you turn blue ?
sure .
gee , you broke it .
it' s glass , ray .
i know , but it' s
well , frenchy , i' m not cleaning it up .
you broke it .
you got glass over everything .
it' s dangerous .
you jesus , i' m
i don' t know what you see in me .
i' m such a screwup .
it' s glass !
don' t you understand ?
i got the glass one .
all that matters is that we have each other .
we didn' t there for a while and it made me realize how much i need you .
yeah , but you' re married to such a loser , frenchy .
no .
it' s glass !
i' m the luckiest woman in the world .
and the brokest .
i' m topped out .
we got nothing .
as usual , i come up empty .
we could pawn this .
what is this ?
what is this thing ?
who ?
who who ?
i don' t understand .
who' s the duke of windsor ?
actually , we could probably auction it .
where' d you get this ?
it looks  from david .
david gave you this ?
well , he doesn' t know it yet .
i don' t get it .
what do you mean ?
hey , it was you who taught me how to open a safe .
l that was one of my fondest memories of our time together .
what are you saying ?
you boosted this from david' s safe ?
that frenchy , that' s stealing .
not exactly .
look , it' s a long story , ray .
let' s sell it , and i' il fill you in on the flight to miami .
sweetheart , you are the greatest .
yeah .
oh , baby , what i couldn' t do
oh , baby , what i couldn' t do
with plenty of money and you
in spite of the worry that money brings
just a little filthy lucre buys a lot of things
and i could take you to places you' d like to go
but outside of that i' ve no use for dough
it' s the root of all evil of strife and upheaval
but i' m certain , honey that life could be sunny
with plenty of money and you
tequila
