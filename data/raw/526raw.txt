rachel , let me see .
can i see ?
finders keepers .
and i found it .
in my garden .
finders keepers .
bruce ?
bruce ?
mom !
mr. alfred !
did you have dream ?
nightmare .
worse than this place ?
they are going to fight you .
again ?
until they kill you .
can they kill me before breakfast ?
you are in hell , little man .
and i am the devil .
you' re not the devil .
you' re practice .
solitary .
why ?
for protection .
i don' t need protection .
protection for them .
get in .
are you so desperate to fight criminals ... ... that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time ?
actually , there were seven of them .
i counted six , mr. wayne .
how do you know my name ?
the world is too small for someone like bruce wayne to disappear ... ... no matter how deep he chooses to sink .
who are you ?
my name is merely ducard , but i speak for ra' s al ghul ... ... a man greatly feared by the criminal underworld .
a man who can offer you a path .
what makes you think i need a path ?
someone like you is only here by choice .
you have been exploring the criminal fraternity ... ... but whatever your original intentions ... ... you have become truly lost .
and what path can ra' s al ghul offer ?
the path of a man who shares his hatred of evil ... ... and wishes to serve true justice .
the path of the league of shadows .
you' re vigilantes .
no , no , no .
a vigilante is just a man lost in the scramble for his own gratification .
he can be destroyed or locked up .
but if you make yourself more than just a man ... ... if you devote yourself to an ideal ... ... and if they can' t stop you ... ... then you become something else entirely .
which is ?
legend , mr. wayne .
tomorrow , you will be released .
if you are bored of brawling with thieves and want to achieve something ... ... there is a rare blue flower that grows on the eastern slopes .
pick one of these flowers .
if you can carry it to the top of the mountain ... ... you may find what you were looking for in the first place .
and what was i looking for ?
only you can know that .
you turn back .
you go back .
ra' s al ghul ?
wait .
what are you seeking ?
i seek ... ... the means to fight injustice .
to turn fear ... ... against those who prey on the fearful .
ducard to manipulate the fears in others ... ... you must first master your own .
are you ready to begin ?
i can ...
i can barely stand .
death does not wait for you to be ready !
death is not considerate or fair !
and make no mistake , here you face death .
tiger .
jujitsu .
panther .
you' re skilled .
but this is not a dance .
and you are afraid .
but not of me .
tell us , mr. wayne ...
... what do you fear ?
bruce ?
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
you' il be okay .
will we be needing an ambulance , master wayne ?
no , i' il set the bone and take him for an x ray later .
very good , sir .
i' m very sorry , sir .
i' ve told don' t worry .
it' s fine .
took quite a fall , didn' t we , master bruce ?
and why do we fall ?
so we can learn to pick ourselves up .
just a little fall .
it' s just a small fracture .
the bats again ?
you know why they attacked you , don' t you ?
they were afraid of you .
afraid of me ?
all creatures feel fear .
even the scary ones ?
especially the scary ones .
i got something to show you .
you think your mother will like them ?
yeah .
i think it' s time to get up .
maybe .
no going back to bed .
did you build this train , dad ?
gotham' s been good to our family , but the city' s been suffering .
people less fortunate than us have been enduring very hard times .
so we built a new , cheap , public transportation system to unite the city .
and at the center ... ... wayne t ower .
is that where you work ?
no , i work at the hospital .
i leave the running of our company to much better men .
better ?
well ... ... more interested men .
can we go ?
please .
okay .
let' s go .
what' s wrong , bruce ?
no , no .
it was me .
i just needed some fresh air .
a little bit of opera goes a long way .
right , bruce ?
come on .
let' s go .
wallets , jewelry .
come on , fast .
that' s fine .
fast .
take it easy .
take it easy .
here you go .
it' s fine .
it' s fine .
now just take it and go .
i said , jewelry .
hey
thomas !
bruce .
it' s okay .
don' t be afraid .
is this your father' s ?
it' s okay .
come here .
there you go .
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
gordon .
hey .
good news .
we got him , son .
you' re in excellent hands .
we' il be watching the empire .
when you grow up , it' il be waiting for you .
i thought i might prepare a little supper .
very well .
alfred ?
yes , master bruce ?
it was my fault , alfred .
i made them leave the theater .
no .
if i hadn' t gotten scared ...
it was nothing that you did .
it was him , and him alone .
do you understand ?
i miss them , alfred .
i miss them so much .
so do i , master bruce .
so do i.
and do you still feel responsible for your parents ' death ?
my anger outweighs my guilt .
come .
you have learned to bury your guilt with anger .
i will teach you to confront it and to face the truth .
you know how to fight six men .
we can teach you how to engage 600 .
you know how to disappear .
we can teach you to become truly invisible .
invisible ?
the ninja understands that invisibility is a matter of patience and agility .
always mind your surroundings .
ninjitsu employs explosive powders .
as weapons ?
or distractions .
theatricality and deception are powerful agents .
you must become more than just a man in the mind of your opponent .
who is he ?
he was a farmer .
then he tried to take his neighbor' s land and became a murderer .
now he is a prisoner .
what' il happen to him ?
justice .
crime cannot be tolerated .
criminals thrive on the indulgence of society' s understanding .
your parents ' death was not your fault .
it was your father' s .
anger does not change the fact that your father failed to act .
the man had a gun .
would that stop you ?
i' ve had training .
the training is nothing !
will is everything !
the will to act .
yield .
you haven' t beaten me .
you have sacrificed sure footing for a killing stroke .
rub your chest .
your arms will take care of themselves .
you are stronger than your father .
you didn' t know my father .
but i know the rage that drives you .
that impossible anger strangling the grief ... ... until the memory of your loved one is just ... ... poison in your veins .
and one day , you catch yourself wishing the person you loved had never existed ... ... so you' d be spared your pain .
i wasn' t always here in the mountains .
once , i had a wife .
my great love .
she was taken from me .
like you , i was forced to learn there are those without decency ... ... who must be fought without hesitation , without pity .
your anger gives you great power .
but if you let it , it will destroy you ... ... as it almost did me .
what stopped it ?
vengeance .
that' s no help to me .
why , bruce ?
why could you not avenge your parents ?
will you be heading back to princeton after the hearing , sir ... ... or can i persuade you to stay on for a day or two ?
i' m not heading back at all .
you don' t like it there ?
i like it fine .
they just don' t feel the same way .
i' ve prepared the master bedroom .
no .
my room will be fine .
with all due respect , sir , wayne manor is your house .
no , alfred , it' s my father' s house .
your father is dead .
this place is a mausoleum .
if i have my way , i' il pull the damn thing down brick by brick .
this house , master wayne , has sheltered six generations of your family .
why do you give a damn , alfred ?
it' s not your family .
i give a damn because a good man once made me responsible ... ... for what was most precious to him ... ... in the whole world .
miss dawes has offered to drive you to the hearing .
she probably hopes to talk you out of going .
should i just bury the past out there with my parents , alfred ?
i wouldn' t presume to tell you what to do with your past , sir .
just know that there are those of us who care about what you do with your future .
haven' t given up on me yet ?
never .
alfred still keeps the condensed milk on the top shelf .
hasn' t he noticed you' re tall enough to reach now ?
old habits die hard , i guess .
never used to stop us anyway .
no , it didn' t .
how' s your mom ?
she misses this place .
so do i.
yeah .
but it' s nothing without the people who made it what it was .
now there' s only alfred .
and you .
i' m not staying , rachel .
you' re just back for the hearing .
bruce , i don' t suppose there' s any way to convince you not to come .
someone at this proceeding ... ... should stand for my parents .
we all loved your parents , bruce .
what chill did is unforgivable .
then why is your boss letting him go ?
in prison , he shared a cell with carmine falcone .
he learned things , and he will testify in exchange for early parole .
rachel , this man killed my parents .
i cannot let that pass .
and i need you to understand that , please .
okay .
the depression hit working people , like mr. chill , hardest of all .
his crime was appalling , yes , but it was motivated not by greed ... ... but by desperation .
given the 14 years served , as well as his extraordinary level of cooperation ... ... with one of this office' s most important investigations ... ... we strongly endorse his petition for early release .
mr. chill ?
your honor ... ... not a day goes by that i don' t wish i could take back what i did .
sure , i was desperate , like a lot of people back then ... ... but that don' t change what i did .
i gather there is a member of the wayne family here today .
has he got anything to say ?
he' s coming out the side !
he' s coming out the side , guys !
bruce wayne !
joe !
hey , joe !
falcone says hi .
come on , bruce .
we don' t need to see this .
i do .
the da couldn' t understand why judge faden insisted ... ... on making the hearing public .
falcone paid him off to get chill out in the open .
maybe i should thank them .
you don' t mean that .
what if i do , rachel ?
my parents deserved justice .
you' re not talking about justice .
you' re talking about revenge .
sometimes , they' re the same .
no , they' re never the same .
justice is about harmony .
revenge is about you making yourself feel better .
it' s why we have an impartial system .
your system is broken .
you care about justice ?
look beyond your own pain , bruce .
this city is rotting .
they talk about the depression as if it' s history .
it' s not .
things are worse than ever here .
falcone floods our streets with crime and drugs ... ... preying on the desperate , creating new joe chills every day .
falcone may not have killed your parents , bruce ... ... but he' s destroying everything that they stood for .
you wanna thank him for that ?
here you go .
we all know where to find him .
as long as he keeps the bad people rich ... ... and the good people scared , no one' il touch him .
good people like your parents , who' il stand against injustice , they' re gone .
what chance does gotham have when the good people do nothing ?
i' m not one of your good people , rachel .
what do you mean ?
all these years , i wanted to kill him .
now i can' t .
your father would be ashamed of you .
you' re taller than you look in the tabloids , mr. wayne .
no gun ?
i' m insulted .
you could' ve just sent a thank you note .
i didn' t come here to thank you .
i came to show you that not everyone in gotham' s afraid of you .
only those who know me , kid .
look around you .
you' il see two councilmen ... ... a union official , couple off duty cops ... ... and a judge .
i wouldn' t have a second' s hesitation of blowing your head off in front of them .
now , that' s power you can' t buy .
that' s the power of fear .
i' m not afraid of you .
because you think you got nothing to lose .
but you haven' t thought it through .
you haven' t thought about your lady friend in the da' s office .
you haven' t thought about your old butler .
bang !
people from your world ... ... have so much to lose .
now , you think because your mommy and your daddy got shot ... ... you know about the ugly side of life , but you don' t .
you' ve never tasted desperate .
you' re ...
you' re bruce wayne , the prince of gotham .
you' d have to go 1000 miles to meet someone who didn' t know your name .
so don' t come here with your anger , trying to prove something to yourself .
this is a world you' il never understand .
and you always fear ... ... what you don' t understand .
all right .
yeah , you got spirit , kid .
i' il give you that .
more than your old man anyway .
in the joint , chill told me about the night he killed your parents .
he said your father begged for mercy .
begged .
like a dog .
should' ve tipped better .
for what ?
your jacket .
okay .
hey , hey , hey .
let me have it .
it' s a nice coat .
be careful who sees you with that .
they' re gonna come looking for me .
who ?
everyone .
it' s ...
it' s a nice coat .
when you lived among the criminals , did you start to pity them ?
the first time i stole so that i wouldn' t starve , yes .
i lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong .
and when i traveled ... ... i learned the fear before a crime ... ... and the thrill of success .
but i never became one of them .
fool .
what do i care what your name is ?
you' re a criminal .
i' m not a criminal
tell that to the guy who owned these .
you' ve traveled the world to understand the criminal mind ... ... and conquer your fears .
but a criminal is not complicated .
and what you really fear is inside yourself .
you fear your own power .
you fear your anger ... ... the drive to do great or terrible things .
now you must journey inwards .
you are ready .
breathe .
breathe .
breathe in your fears .
face them .
t o conquer fear , you must become fear .
you must bask in the fear of other men .
and men fear most what they cannot see .
you have to become a terrible thought .
a wraith .
you have to become an idea !
feel terror cloud your senses .
feel its power to distort .
t o control .
and know that this power can be yours .
embrace your worst fear .
become one with the darkness .
focus .
concentrate .
master your senses .
you cannot leave any sign .
i haven' t .
impressive .
we have purged your fear .
you are ready to lead these men .
you are ready to become a member of the league of shadows .
but first , you must demonstrate your commitment to justice .
no .
i' m no executioner .
your compassion is a weakness your enemies will not share .
that' s why it' s so important .
it separates us from them .
you want to fight criminals .
this man is a murderer .
this man should be tried .
by whom ?
corrupt bureaucrats ?
criminals mock society' s laws .
you know this better than most .
you cannot lead these men ... ... unless you are prepared to do what is necessary to defeat evil .
and where would i be leading these men ?
gotham .
as gotham' s favored son ... ... you will be ideally placed to strike at the heart of criminality .
how ?
gotham' s time has come .
like constantinople or rome before it ... ... the city has become a breeding ground for suffering and injustice .
it is beyond saving and must be allowed to die .
this is the most important function of the league of shadows .
it is one we' ve performed for centuries .
gotham ... ... must be destroyed .
you can' t believe in this .
ra' s al ghul rescued us from the darkest corners of our own hearts .
what he asks in return is the courage to do what is necessary .
i will go back to gotham and i will fight men like this ... ... but i will not become an executioner .
bruce , please .
for your own sake , there is no turning back .
what are you doing ?
what' s necessary , my friend .
i will tell him you saved his life .
master wayne , you' ve been gone a long time .
yes , i have .
you look very fashionable .
apart from the mud .
are you coming back to gotham for long , sir ?
as long as it takes .
i want to show the people ... ... their city doesn' t belong to the criminals and the corrupt .
in the depression , your father nearly bankrupted wayne enterprises ... ... combating poverty .
he believed his example could inspire the wealthy of gotham to save their city .
did it ?
in a way .
their murder shocked the wealthy and the powerful into action .
people need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy .
i can' t do that as bruce wayne .
as a man ... ... i' m flesh and blood , i can be ignored , destroyed .
but as a symbol ...
as a symbol , i can be incorruptible .
i can be everlasting .
what symbol ?
something elemental ... ... something terrifying .
i assume that as you take on the underworld ... ... this symbol is a persona to protect those you care about from reprisals ?
you' re thinking about rachel ?
actually , sir , i was thinking of myself .
have you told anyone i' m coming back ?
i couldn' t figure the legal ramifications of bringing you back from the dead .
dead ?
you' ve been gone seven years .
you had me declared dead ?
actually , it was mr. earle .
he' s taking the company public .
he wanted to liquidate your majority shareholding .
those shares are worth quite a bit of money .
well , it' s a good thing i left everything to you , then .
quite so , sir .
and you can borrow the rolls , if you like .
just bring it back with a full tank .
in my opinion , mr. zsaz is as much a danger to himself as to others ... ... and prison is probably not the best environment for his rehabilitation .
dr. crane .
miss dawes .
you think a man who butchers people for the mob doesn' t belong in jail ?
i would hardly have testified to that otherwise , would i ?
this is the third of falcone' s thugs you' ve had declared insane ... ... and moved into your asylum .
the work offered by organized crime must have an attraction to the insane .
or the corrupt .
mr. finch .
you should check with miss dawes here ... ... just what implications your office has authorized her to make .
if any .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing , carl ?
looking out for you .
falcone has half the city bought and paid for .
drop it .
how can you say that ?
because as much as i care about getting falcone , i care more about you .
that' s sweet .
we' ve been through all that .
blessed bat again , sir .
they nest somewhere in the grounds .
no more favors .
someone is sniffing around .
hey , i scratch your back , you scratch mine , doc .
i' m bringing in the shipments .
we are paying you for that .
maybe money isn' t as interesting to me as favors .
i am more than aware that you are not intimidated by me , mr. falcone .
but you know who i' m working for , and when he gets here
he he' s coming to gotham ?
yes , he is .
and when he gets here , he' s not going to wanna hear ... ... that you' ve endangered our operation just to get your thugs out of jail time .
who' s bothering you ?
there' s a girl at the da' s office .
we' il buy her off .
not this one .
idealist , huh ?
well , there' s an answer to that too .
i don' t want to know .
yes , you do .
no , we are showing very healthy growth in these sectors .
i don' t think thomas wayne would have viewed heavy arms manufacture ... ... as a suitable cornerstone for our business .
well , that' s 20 years ago , fredericks .
i think after 20 years we can allow ourselves ... ... to stop thinking about what thomas wayne would have done .
good morning , mr. earle' s office .
yes , he' s confirmed for the dinner tomorrow evening .
good morning .
i' m here to see mr. earle .
name ?
bruce wayne .
thomas would probably not have taken the company public .
but that is what we , as responsible managers , are going to do .
jessica ?
jessica ?
where are you ?
eye on the ball , and ...
why is no one answering the phone ?
it' s wayne enterprises , mr. earle .
i' m sure they' il call back .
bruce ?
you' re supposed to be dead .
i' m sorry to disappoint .
i need you to take a look at this .
have you seen him yet ?
who ?
wayne .
it' s been all over the news .
he' s back .
i' m sure you realize i can' t stop the big machine .
too many wheels turning .
we' re going public .
i understand .
and i' il be handsomely rewarded for my shares .
i' m not looking to interfere .
i am looking for a job .
oh ?
i just want to get to know the company that my family built .
any ideas where you would start ?
applied sciences caught my eye .
fox' s department .
i' il let him know you' re coming .
you look like him .
your dad .
you' re the only one left of the wayne family .
this is where you belong .
welcome home .
environmental procedures , defense projects , consumer products .
all prototypes .
none in production .
on any level whatsoever .
none ?
what did they tell you this place was ?
they didn' t tell me anything .
earle told me exactly what it was when he sent me down here .
dead end .
place to keep me from causing the board any more trouble .
come on .
you were on the board ?
when your father ran things .
you knew my father ?
oh , yeah .
helped him build his train .
here we are .
kevlar utility harness .
gas powered , magnetic grapple gun .
the 350 pound test monofilament .
wonderful project , your dad' s train .
routed it right into wayne t ower , along with the water and power utilities .
kind of made wayne t ower the unofficial center of gotham city .
of course , earle let it go to rot .
here we are .
nomex survival suit for advanced infantry .
kevlar biweave , reinforced joints .
t ear resistant ?
this sucker will stop a knife .
bulletproof ?
anything but a straight shot .
why didn' t they put it into production ?
bean counters didn' t think ... ... a soldier' s life was worth 300 grand .
so , what' s your interest in it , mr. wayne ?
i want to borrow it .
for spelunking .
spelunking ?
yeah , you know , cave diving ?
you expecting to run into much gunfire in these caves ?
look , i' d rather mr. earle didn' t know about me borrowing
mr. wayne ... ... the way i see it ... ... all this stuff is yours anyway .
okay .
give it a try .
charming .
at least you' il have company .
this must be the lowest foundation of the southeast wing .
your great great grandfather was involved in the underground railroad ... ... secretly transporting freed slaves to the north ... ... and i suspect these caverns came in handy .
alfred !
come up here !
i can see everything all right from down here , sir , thank you .
we order the main part of this cowl from singapore .
via a dummy corporation .
indeed .
and then , quite separately ... ... we place an order to a chinese company for these .
put it together ourselves .
precisely .
they' il have to be large orders , to avoid suspicion .
how large ?
say 10, 000 .
well , at least we' il have spares .
yes .
don' t suppose you want a taste .
i just keep offering , thinking maybe someday you' il get wise .
there' s nothing wise in what you do , flass .
well , jimbo , you don' t take the taste , makes us guys nervous .
i' m no rat .
in a town this bent , who' s there to rat to anyway ?
don' t turn around .
you' re a good cop .
one of the few .
what do you want ?
carmine falcone brings in shipments of drugs every week .
nobody takes him down .
why ?
he' s paid up with the right people .
what will it take to bring him down ?
leverage on judge faden ... ... and a da brave enough to prosecute .
rachel dawes .
who are you ?
watch for my sign .
you' re just one man ?
now we' re two .
we ?
freeze !
what the hell was that ?
just some nut .
well , what is it today ?
more spelunking ?
no .
today it' s base jumping .
base jumping .
that like parachuting ?
kind of .
do you have any lightweight fabrics ?
you know , i think i have just the thing .
it' s called memory cloth .
notice anything ?
regularly flexible ... ... but put a current through it ... ... molecules realign , it becomes rigid .
what kind of shapes can you make ?
can be tailored to fit any structure based on a rigid skeleton .
t oo expensive for the army ?
i don' t think they tried to market it to the billionaire , base jumping crowd .
look , mr. fox .
yes , sir ?
if you' re uncomfortable
mr. wayne , if you don' t want to tell me exactly what you' re doing ... ... when i' m asked , i don' t have to lie .
but don' t think of me as an idiot .
fair enough .
what' s that ?
the tumbler ?
oh , you wouldn' t be interested in that .
she was built as a bridging vehicle .
during combat , two of these would jump over a river , towing cables .
over here on the throttle , flip that open and throttle up .
this will boost you into a rampless jump not now !
not not now , sir .
afterburner disengaged .
we never could get the damn bridge to work ... ... but this baby works just fine .
so , what do you think ?
does it come in black ?
i need you at the docks thursday .
problems ?
i don' t want any trouble ...
... with the last shipment .
sure .
word on the street is you got a beef with somebody in the da' s office .
is that right ?
and that there' s a fat prize ... ... waiting for anybody willing to do anything about it .
so , what' s your point , mr. flass ?
have you seen the girl ?
flass it' s a cute little assistant da .
don' t you think that' s a little too much heat to bring down , maybe ?
even for this town .
never underestimate gotham city .
people get mugged coming home from work every day of the week .
sometimes sometimes things just go bad .
it' s a problem with the graphite , sir .
the next 10, 000 will be up to specifications .
at least they gave us a discount .
quite .
in the meantime , sir , may i suggest you try to avoid landing on your head ?
why bats , master wayne ?
bats frighten me .
it' s time my enemies shared my dread .
what is this ?
continue .
looks fine out there .
the bears go straight to the dealers .
y eah , and the rabbits go to the man in the narrows .
what' s the difference ?
ignorance is bliss , my friend .
don' t burden yourself with the secrets of scary people .
hey .
steiss .
steiss ?
what ?
what the ... ?
i better check it .
there' s a problem out here .
you better bail .
where are you ? !
here .
take a ride .
oh , shit .
what the hell are you ?
i' m batman .
nice coat .
thanks .
hold it .
that' s right , you better run .
falcone sent them to kill you .
why ?
you rattled his cage .
what' s this ?
leverage .
for what ?
t o get things moving .
who are you ?
someone like you .
someone who' il rattle the cages .
ma' am ?
everything okay ?
falcone' s men ?
does it matter ?
we' il never tie him to it anyway .
i wouldn' t be too sure of that .
what the hell is that ?
cut him down .
unacceptable .
now , i don' t care if it' s rival gangs , guardian angels ... ... or the goddamn salvation army ... ... get them off the street and off the front page .
they say it was just one guy .
or a creature .
it was some asshole in a costume .
yeah ?
this guy did deliver us ... ... one of the city' s biggest crime lords .
no one takes the law into their own hands in my city .
understand ?
no way to bury it now .
there' s still judge faden .
i' ve got faden covered .
what about this bat they babble about ?
even if these guys will swear to being thrashed by a giant bat ... ... we' ve got falcone at the scene .
drugs , prints , cargo manifests .
this bat character gave us everything .
okay .
let' s do it .
bats are nocturnal .
bats may be .
but even for billionaire playboys , 3 : 00 is pushing it .
the price for leading a double life , i fear .
your theatrics made an impression .
theatricality and deception ... ... are powerful weapons , alfred .
this is a good start .
if those are to be the first of many injuries to come ... ... it would be wise to find a suitable excuse .
polo , for instance .
i' m not learning polo , alfred .
strange injuries , a nonexistent social life .
these things beg the question ... ... as to what exactly does bruce wayne do with his time and his money .
what does someone like me do ?
drive sports cars , date movie stars .
buy things that are not for sale .
who knows , master wayne , you start pretending to have fun ... ... you might even have a little by accident .
sir .
we have a situation .
all right .
the coast guard picked up one of our cargo ships last night ... ... heavily damaged , all crew missing , probably dead .
the ship was carrying a prototype weapon .
it' s a microwave emitter .
it' s designed for desert warfare , but it
it looks like somebody ...
... turned it on .
it uses focused microwaves to vaporize the enemy' s water supply .
the damage to the ship was catastrophic .
the weapon itself is ...
missing ?
yeah .
mr. wayne .
nice car .
you should see my other one .
he' s done something the police never have .
you can' t take the law into your own hands .
well , at least he' s getting something done .
bruce , help me out here .
huh ?
well , a guy who dresses up like a bat clearly has issues .
but he' s put falcone behind bars .
now the cops want him .
what does that tell you ?
they' re jealous .
sir , the pool is for decoration ... ... and your friends do not have swimwear .
well , they' re european .
i' m going to have to ask you to leave .
it is not a question of money .
well , you see ... ... i' m buying this hotel ... ... and setting some new rules about the pool area .
i think the batman deserves a medal .
and a straitjacket to pin it on .
thank you .
bruce ?
rachel ?
i' d heard you were back .
what are you doing ?
just swimming here .
wow , it is good to see you .
you were gone a long time .
i know .
how are things ?
the same .
job' s getting worse .
can' t change the world on your own .
what choice do i have ... ... when you' re too busy swimming ?
rachel , all of
all this ...
it' s it' s not me .
it' s ...
inside , i am ...
i am more .
come on , bruce .
come on .
bruce , we have some more hotels for you to buy .
bruce ... ... deep down you may still be that same great kid you used to be .
but it' s not who you are underneath ... ... it' s what you do that defines you .
dr. crane , thanks for coming .
not at all .
he cut his wrists ?
probably looking for the insanity plea .
but if anything should happen ...
of course , better safe than sorry .
yeah , dr. crane , i can' t take it anymore .
it' s all too much .
the walls are closing in .
blah , blah , blah .
a couple of days of this food , it' il be true .
what do you want ?
i wanna know ... ... how you' re gonna convince me to keep my mouth shut .
about what ?
you don' t know anything .
i know you don' t want the cops to take a closer look at the drugs they seized .
