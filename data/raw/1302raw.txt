commissioner pierre niemans .

paris said they' d send a unit .
what the heil ?
i' m the unit .
captain ... ... i didn' t drive aii night to wage war with cops .
what' s the iow down ?
foilow me .
two days ago , the coilege dean reported remy cailois missing .
thirty two years old , single .
remy iectured at the coilege .
he was also the iibrarian .
an upper echelon job there .
according to the dean , remy was punctuai and hardworking .
he never showed up iate .
yesterday afternoon ... ... a young mountain climber found his body .
why caii in the homicide squad ?
we' re not used to this kind of stuff .
why ?
his body was strung up there .
at 50 meters .
guernon university , 500 meters
you' re from the homicide unit , but not reaily , is that it ?
that' s it .
we never dealt with you before .
you' re iucky .
happy is he who penetrates the hldden causes of thlngs
what' s this coilege doing here ?
it' s no ordinary coilege .
it provides its own electricity , its own water .
it even has a hospital .
1, 200 students .
100 professors and researchers .
one of europe' s oldest universities .
in case of a snowstorm , it can survive for a month .
the dean is iike the mayor of the vailey .
he runs most of the region .
here' s where they form future biii gates .
future what ?
future biii gates .
the hospital' s attached to the coilege ?
it' s open to everyone in the region .
we aii get free health care .
we work a iot with them .
there' s even a maternity wing .
this is commissioner niemans .
he' ii be helping out on this case .
i was in your criminology class in 1987 .
did you start yet ?
i haven' t cut the cord .
can we see ?
i figured you' d want to see him intact .
it' s incredible .
the work of a reai madman .
he strove for the foetai position .
what position ?
the foetal .
like a foetus in its mother' s beily .
he' s been dead for 48 hours .
examination reveals traces of incisions ... ... on the shoulders , arms , elbows and thighs ... ... made by a sharp instrument .
a carpet cutter .
can you cut the cord ?
four broken ribs .
arms broken at the shoulders and elbows .
multiple fractures : tibia , hip ....
i' ii put it aii in a detailed report .
the hands were amputated before he died , with an axe ... ... the stumps cauterised to avoid his bleeding to death .
the kiiler obviously wanted to keep his victim alive .
i wouldn' t do that ....
he carved out the eyes iike a surgeon .
operating on a iive patient .
what the fuck is this shit ?
the sockets were fiiled with rain .
it' s being analysed .
there' s a good eye doctor in guernon .
he may shed some iight on this .
how iong did it take him to die ?
i' d have to cut him open , but i' d say five hours .
the size and precision of the wounds ... ... indicate that he wanted his victim conscious ... ... but in the greatest possible state of pain .
check every prison , every ioony bin and sect .
every trail , refuge and ski slope .
run random identity checks on drivers in a 160 kilometre radius .
dig up evidence of similar mutilations in the past 20 years .
talk to possible witnesses and cailois' s coileagues .
anyone who knew his itinerary .
find out where it rained in the past two days .
find anything : witnesses , clues ....
you have two hours .
doctor cherneze ophthalmologlst
who' s there ?
who' s there ?
who is it ?
why won' t you talk ?
doctor !
who are you ?
what' s going on ?
get the dog out of here .
it' s nothing .
go home .
everything' s aii right .
see you on tuesday .
who are you ?
commissioner niemans .
sorry , dogs scare me shitless .
dogs are not to fear .
just their masters .
how can i help you ?
i' m investigating remy cailois' s death .
i heard about it .
how awful .
did you know him ?
i knew his father .
we went to coilege together .
did you teach at the coilege ?
for 20 years .
but i stopped teaching in 1982 .
why ?
difference of opinion .
with the dean ?
i don' t understand .
what' s the iink between me and remy ?
i have some pictures i' d iike your opinion of .
he was tortured ?
for severai hours .
how horrible ....
i didn' t know .
no hands ?
nor eyes .
that' s why i' m here .
to understand these mutilations .
how would i know ?
what exactly do you treat ?
genetic afflictions concerning the eyes .
hereditary diseases transmitted from one generation to the next .
they strike isolated areas and with the coilege ....
what about the coilege ?
teachers have been marrying among themselves for ages .
the bloodlines are weak , worn out .
genetic problems keep popping up .
the ransom of the elite .
i thought the professors ' kids were prodigies .
they are .
i don' t get it .
over the past two generations ... ... the situation has reversed .
the native mountain children are getting sick .
like the boy you just saw .
could there be a connection between the mutilations and the diseases ?
hands and eyes are the body parts that belong to us alone .
they' re different from anyone else' s , iike with dna .
they' re our biologicai identity .
your kiiler is giving you hints as to his motive .
and he starts stabbing away .
he stabs the dog , stabs the guy ... ... grabs the bag and throws the knife under the car !
seriously , paris is fuii of psychos !
the subway !
the cops !
robocops !
hand over your ticket , please !

we can' t always choose our school .

they caii me " gravedigger " .
over the past 27 years , i' ve seen 248 , no , wait ... ... 249 accidents entailing deaths .
on our part of the highway alone .
30 kilometres !
cops and firemen get aii the attention .
but we' re the first guys on the scene .

what do you think ?
i' m iooking for the parents of a giri kiiled in ' 82 .

when we got there , the mother was at the side of the road .
she was holding ....

the only piece of her daughter stiii intact .
she said her kid ran away and tried running across the highway .
god knows what happened .

unlverslty of guernon
the dean' s office ?
that way , on your ieft .
i want to see the dean .
i' m his assistant .
how can i help ?
by getting me the dean , now .
who shaii i say is here ?
commissioner niemans .
commissioner niemans for you .
have a seat .
i' ii just be a minute .
i' m a slave to this university .
i never have enough time .
what can i do ?
i' m investigating cailois' s death .
i spoke to captain dahmane .
teii me about remy' s private iife .
do you work with dahmane ?
neither with nor without .
i iead a speciai unit .
it' s you .
i don' t understand what happened .
remy never posed the slightest problem .
he was kind , hardworking .
his parents were close friends .
he took over his father' s job in the iibrary .
he went to schooi here ?
like most of us .
many students are born and grow up here .
some become professors iike their parents .
it' s sort of the tradition .
it was the case with remy .
he didn' t have a police record .
maybe there' s something we missed , that may be of help .
like what ?
someone who hated him .
drug use , some religious conviction ....
i think you misunderstood me .
this university is a community , a temple of knowledge .
everyone iives and works here in perfect harmony .
to accuse one of us is to accuse aii of us , including me .
i want to visit his apartment .
i' m afraid that' s impossible .
the police sealed it off .
i' d iike to see it aii the same .
hubert , come here , please .
unfortunately , i can' t join you .
i hope you don' t mind if my son shows you the way .
as i told you , traditions are a way of iife here .
we' ve been voted " best coilege " three years in a row .
we even helped raise the nationai average .
just for fun , we calculated the average iq here .
guess how much .
twenty four .
excuse me ?
cailois had room 24 .
do you have the key ?
no .
do you have permission to go in ?
what did he do at the iibrary ?
he was in charge of books and seating arrangements .
seating arrangements ?
our tradition is to be seated in the same place every year .
it' s beneficiai and makes seating easier .
dominissimus .
simus serve .
ubicum que ....
we are the masters .
we are the slaves .
we are everywhere .
we are nowhere .
we controi the crimson rivers .
it was his ph. d. thesis .
he' d been working on it for years .
fanny ferreira ?
up there .
i' ve got to go .
see you tomorrow .
fanny ferreira ?
you discovered remy cailois' s corpse ?
who are you ?
pierre niemans .
i came from paris to investigate .
paris exports cops now ?
depends on the case .
too bad .
i iike the iocai yokels .
their seriousness cracks me up .
me , too .
you can make a difference ?
i' ve been trying to for 25 years .
maybe you can help .
i doubt it .
i didn' t see much .
i scaled the cliff twice before noticing him .
didn' t you read my statement ?
did ....
did the kiiler have to be strong to get the body up there ?
not necessarily .
with know how and good equipment , you can iift anything , anywhere .
what was he iike ?
a pretentious asshole .
like most students here .
i agree .
it seems pretty ....
uptight ?
exactly .
a closed circuit race course for high performance cars .
if you' ve been around once ....
i read that you' re a glaciologist .
what do you do ?
i controi avalanches .
the school' s in a vailey , so i try to steer them away .
you protect the school .
i do my job .
like remy cailois .
what ?
you went to , and work for the school , iike remy cailois .
so ?
you' re part of the clan .
what clan ?
the elite composed of professors ' kids .
i have a busy day and i don' t iike uniforms .
your coileagues have my number .
it' s the pathologist .
i got the results of the water in his eyes .
it' s rain water .
acid rain .
what ?
it' s pretty common .
but we haven' t had any acid rain since the 1970s .
and it hasn' t rained recently .
i don' t get it .
it' s ice cold .
freezing .
heilo , sister .
i' m a police officer .
does a certain mrs. herault reside here ?
may i ask why ?
i' m sorry .
i' m afraid not .
i can' t say .
sister andre has been here for 17 years .
this concerns a relatively old incident .
could i possibly see her ?
i' ii see .
come in .
wait here .
take off your cap ....
where do you think you are ?
my son !
wait here .
sister andre wiii see you .
but i should warn you ....
about what ?
you can speak to her , but you cannot see her .
you can iisten , but you cannot go near .
why not ?
the shadows , my son .
what about the shadows ?
sister andre took the vow of the shadows .
we haven' t seen her for 15 years .
sister ....
sister andre ?
sister ?
i' m a police officer from sarzac , just nearby .
your daughter is buried there , right ?
judith was your daughter , wasn' t she ?
i' m here because iast night someone tried to open her tomb .
they' re coming back .
who ?
they' re coming back to complete their mission .
who are you talking about ?
the demons .
they want to make sure judith won' t cause them any more trouble .
so it' s these demons who kiiled your daughter ?
could you try being a iittle more explicit ?
for 18 years i' ve been trying to forget .
last night ... ... your demons ... ... broke into the schooi and stole judith' s class picture .
i need your help to understand why .
in order to erase every trace of my child .
what for ?
to protect their secret .
what secret ?
judith' s face is a threat to them .
please , sister .
i' m sorry , but ....
can you teii me the circumstances of your daughter' s death ?
my daughter feii iil .
we went to the hospitai she was born in .
then the demons attacked us .
they chased us .
i wanted to run away , to disappear with my daughter .
but they found us .
no one can escape their clutches .
where did you iive before sarzac ?
the nightmare began in guernon .
did you try cailing the police for help ?
i speak of demons ... ... and you speak of police .
there' s nothing you can do for my child .
save your soui while you stiii can .
leave me now .
i want to stop remembering .
forgive me .
glaciers are formed from years of compacted snow .
the snow is compressed into ice .
each season has a corresponding stratum .
this glacier is 200 metres deep .
it' s a huge source of water and energy .
the water composing it dates back centuries .
what' s the point of studying glaciers ?
the college power plant has a research lab .
this glacier is sliding .
we study the risk factor it represents .
here .
how far down do we have to go ?
at ieast 30 metres .
why did you choose me ?
there are great guides in the area .

and you were available .

let' s say i' m picking you up .
put this on .
don' t step on the rope .
welcome to the time machine , commissioner .
i' ii compare this ice to the acid rain you had analysed .
we' re at the right depth .
he must have brought us here for a reason .
there must be a clue ....
a trace .
niemans , that' s dangerous !
we can' t stay here .
water can come gushing in at any second .
what' s back there ?
naturai water canals .
what are you doing ?
where are you going ?
where are we ?

we can' t stay here .
it' s dangerous .
let' s go .
what' s wrong ?

into the vault of judith herault , who died in 1982 .
he couldn' t open the coffin , so he tried misleading us with swastikas .
that night , someone broke into the elementary school ... ... and stole pictures and documents from ' 81 and ' 82 ... ... the two years judith herault attended that school .
she' s one of these kids .
how did she die ?
run over by a truck .
they cailed it an accident .
but the mother told me something completely different .
according to her ... ... her daughter was kiiled by demons .
demons ....
she has a major screw ioose .
she' s in a convent since .
but i got the impression she wasn' t teiling me ail ....
did you griii her or have tea ?
i was investigating a misdemeanour .
i couldn' t punch her to get her to talk .
she' s a nun .
your turn .
teii me what' s going on .
it' s a treasure hunt .
each corpse ieads to the next one .
let' s say that ... ... sertys , cailois and cherneze are iinked by an incident ... ... that happened 20 years ago .
two days ago they iearn cailois is dead .
we find the body .
they panic .
the past resurfaces .
they go to the cemetery and the school ... ... to check ....
to find something ....
but what ?
if judith is reaily dead .
why ?
she' s seeking revenge .
the nun probably faked her death .
and the prints ?
fingers can be cut off .
the guy who shot at me had five fingers .
why did he iet you iive ?
so i' d understand his vengeance .
what iinks the three victims ?
cailois was head iibrarian .
sertys worked in the maternity ward .
cherneze worked with the dean .
it aii ieads to the university .
i better get back .
what about me ?
see if judith is dead .
i knew you' d say that .
i get the fun stuff .
caii me with any news .
what are you doing here ?
your coileagues held me for four hours .
sorry .
everyone' s on edge .
want a ride ?
sure .
so cherneze is dead , too ?
did you know him ?
one of the coilege' s iast dinosaurs .
you don' t seem to appreciate the geniuses you iive among .
i don' t respect inteilectuals much .
weren' t your parents professors ?
i don' t respect my parents much .
take a ieft here .
is anyone expecting you ?
you' re a iousy don juan .
thanks .
no problem .
judlth herault
nice place .
i iike it .
it' s far from everything .
no tv , no radio ... ... even ceii phones don' t work .
a grenade ?
thanks .
i use them to trigger avalanches .
are aii the iocals iike you ?
battling mountains helps forge your character .
same goes for cops .
have you been one for iong ?
too iong .
buy iighter fluid .
i should .
but i' m trying to quit .
it was a gift .
from your ex ?
i never got married .
how about you ?
almost .
with the dean' s son .
that could never work .
it sure was intended to .
after three years face to face in a reading room ... ... you get close .
why do you hate the schooi so much ?
why do you suspect me ?
you climb mountains .
you found the first body , helped me find the second .
you' re the perfect suspect .
except for one thing .
what ?
you' re incapable ... ... of strangling someone for 10 minutes , eye to eye .
i have to go .
thanks for the tea .
heilo .
teii me about remy cailois' s thesis .
he talks about the myth of olympus ... ... greek athletes who combined mind and body .
he refers a iot to the berlin olympic games of 1936 ... ... when german athletes fueiled nazi propaganda .
and " crimson rivers " ?
flow with the blood of perfect men .
blood ?
veins ....
commissioner .
you want my opinion ?
seriously , his thesis is a potpourri of nazi crap .
at the end , it' s iike " how to be a perfect fascist .
he explains how to create the perfect man today .
how ?
by combining brawny kids with brainy ones .
by selecting them and marrying them .
it' s cailed ....
eugenics .
eugenics , that' s it .
like nazis tried in some viilages during the war .
like at this school .
healthy minds ... ... in healthy bodies .
what are you doing ?
you have no business here !
what role did cailois play exactly ?
excuse me ?
cailois .
sertys .
cherneze .
it aii ieads here .
what are you after ?
you suspect us , don' t you ?
victims can be guilty , too .
watch what you say , niemans .
i inquired about you .
you' re on the razor' s edge ....
i' d gladly put you first on the iist .
aii that' s stopping me is the desire to prove you' re behind it ail .
am i wrong ?
am i ?
stop it !
are you crazy ?
you' ii be hearing from me !
can' t i ieave you alone for a minute ?
what did you find in the tomb ?
i don' t know if it' ii be any help .
it' s not her .
you know her ?
she helped with the case .
she helped you ?
to understand the meaning of the " crimson rivers .
they' ve iived in a closed circuit here for ages .
inbreeding ied the professors to start having degenerate kids .
so they needed new blood .
new blood ?
in the maternity wing , they replace professors ' kids ... ... with healthy newborn mountain babies .
sertys' s father exchanged fanny with judith ?
and plenty of others .
what for ?
to create a superior race .
nazis ?
a freaking nazi coilege ?
not a coilege .
a breeding ground .
who the fuck is it ?
shoot !
shoot !
it' s builet proof .
aim for the same spot .
go on , shoot !
shoot !
watch out !
are you okay ?
who' s this bastard ?
the dean' s son .
what did he want ?
to stop us from knowing what they did to fanny .
what could he do to fanny ?
he was 10 back then .
he was exchanged .
he was seated with fanny at the iibrary .
he should have married her .
that was the plan .
so then why is she kiiling them aii off ?
she refuses to play by their rules .
you think she' s innocent ?
my coat !
hold on .
a la niemans .
who is this babe of yours ?
lady cliff hanger ?
shit !
are you stiii not sure ?
to think she brought me here !
i could have seen it ail .
she could have operated on you , too !
she didn' t want to kiii me .
she ieft me alive .
what are you talking about ?
she ieft you alive , but three other guys didn' t make it .
your girlfriend' s hobby is to cut up her boyfriends .
why the treasure hunt ?
what are you talking about ?
she' s a schizoid !
a psycho kiiler !
she wants us to understand .
what' s to understand ?
she wants to get caught .
good news .
that' s our job , right ?
now we just have to find her .
that' s our job .
what now ?
she took the grenades .
what grenades ?
closed up iike a fucking clam ....
did you evacuate the coilege ?
i need an explanation first !
it' s not the time for explanations .
evacuate .
this can' t go on .
who' s up there ?
i go alone .
it' s everyone or no one !
i' m going alone .
everyone , freeze !

that' s why her face was a threat to them .
take care of her .
so who died in the car accident ?
what about the fingerprint ?
mommy prepared it ail .
the other giri was already dead .
mommy planned everything .
except your going haywire .
you thought you' d make it ?
i don' t intend to make it .
freeze , or you reaily won' t make it .
stop !
leave her alone !
i' ii trigger an avalanche .
listen to me .
stay away !
the men who hurt you are aii dead .
if you do this , they' ii win .
only you can stop her , fanny .
