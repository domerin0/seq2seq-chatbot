how much action ?
cosimo says 300 grand .
holy shit .
yeah .
i know .
i don' t know .
look .
how much money did you wake up with in your pocket this morning ?
fifty five cents .

he' s a nut case , but he always needs dough .
i can' t do it .
my sister' s engaged to be married .
jesus .
this will pay for the wedding .
this is 10 grand we' re talking about .
fianc' s a snob from the suburbs .
if i go to the pen , there' d be no wedding .
this is crazy .
how hard can it be to find a mullinski ?
you gotta know somebody that could use the dough .
friends who' d be better off in jail .
what the fuck does that mean ?
it means what it means .
screw cosimo .
why give a shit ?
he' s the biggest asshole in collinwood .
yeah , but he' s got a bellini .
what are you doing to me ?
you wanna find a mullinski ?
every sucker' s got a bellini .
this one' s legit .
a lifer gave it up to him .
anybody who helps can get a piece of the action .
why didn' t the lifer pull it ?
because he' s a lifer .
he went to the pen before he could .
a genuine bellini ?
you swear on your mother ?
i swear on my mother .

my wife' s in the pen .
i had to sell my cameras to buy diapers and baby food .

it' s impossible .
i got the kid , for chrissake .

seneca .
they gave her a year for fraud .
even with a newborn .
they set her fine at 1000 bucks .
christ .
we' re so broke , she had to do the time .
a year for 1000 bucks .
i know .
you know , they' ve got a fabulous nursery at seneca .
i was born there .
we' re in a real pickle .
we need a mullinski .
we need one fast .
you' re not gonna ...
you' re not gonna get an ex con for grand theft auto .
you need somebody with a clean record so the judge' il go easy on him .
jesus , it' s not like the old days anymore .
you guys know pero ?
baby coming through .
baby coming through .
baby coming through .
baby fucking coming through .
here , let' s put this on you .

cosimo won' t share his job with them .
it was an accident .
i was talking , my mouth slipped .
he' s gonna kill me for this .
he' s gonna kill me .
i' m not going to prison for that fool .
not even for 15 grand ?
you told us 10 .
my boxing career' s about to take off .

this jackass is our last chance .
maybe sweeten the deal .
he' s this close .
i say we go equal parts on another 1000 .
a thousand dollars would get my wife out .
what is it with you guys ?
you gotta spend money to make money .
man , she' s right .
if we don' t spring cosimo , there' s no job .
we' il go 16, 000 on the deal .
i don' t need it .
when my career takes off , i' m spinning on this neighborhood .
mahlovic , you' re up !

order .
order .
hold on !
hear me out .
hear me out .
remove him .
please , your honor , i' m here to confess .
that man is innocent .
your honor , i can no longer live with the guilt .
it was me who was stealing that car .
i confess .
my brother cosimo , saint cosimo , as he' s known on the streets ... ... was only trying to stop me .
cosimo , i mean to steal this car .
i am a car thief .
i steal cars .
by myself .
i' m gonna kill you !
wait .
hold on .
you' re the worst mullinski ever .
not only that , you added six months .
six months to my sentence .
six months .
six months .
who cares about six months ?
i just got three fucking years , man !
i want my money back .
otherwise , you' re gonna die in this prison .
get out .
fine .
i don' t care .
i don' t care about anything anymore .
what' s the matter with you ?
come on .
prison is easy , you puss .
no .
you don' t understand .
i betrayed my brother .
maybe he deserved it .
he' s dying , you jackass !
my real brother , bleeko , is dying .
now he' il have to die alone .
just last week he said to me ...
he said , " pero , be there for me in the final moments ... ... when death has me in its deadly grip .
don' t let me go it alone .
i swore to him i wouldn' t , but i betrayed him .
for a lousy 16 grand .
you' re a sick bastard .
no , i' m not laughing at you .
i' m laughing at ...
you wanna hear something gonna cheer you up ?
you know that old building on chester avenue ?
there' s a million old buildings .
the factory with the gold brick .
what about it ?
it' s not a flour factory anymore .
half became apartments .
guess what' s on the other half ?
i don' t care .
a jewelry shylock .
so what ?
so my cellmate , the bricklayer , he split the building .
he pulled a krazner .
what ?
you know , a krazner .
he mortared the wall between the apartment and the shylock ... ... with sand and water .
you can push through it .
shylock' s a big shot .
the bricklayer said he has a fortune in that safe .
you still have to break into the apartment .
that' s the beauty of it .
nobody lives there .
it' s vacant .
you can walk in .
you' re a bigger jackass than everyone says .
what are you talking about ?
lf this job is so good ... ... why didn' t the old man pull it himself .
two days before the job , he fights with his wife .
shoots her dead .
he' s a lifer now , so he gave me the job .
you were to spring me so i could pull it .
now we' re in the can together .
funny shit , huh ?
yeah , it is .
i mean , really funny , right ?
you have no idea .
you' re free to go .
thanks .
where' s he going ?
you told me you had three years .
you know , i did , but the judge suspended the sentence .
i' m gonna fucking kill you !
you son of a bitch .
your mother' s a whore .
my mother' s a what ?
a whore !
your mother' s a whore !
goddamn !
shit .
come to see me home ?
i want the money back .
i did my job , baby .
it' s not my fault the judge didn' t buy it .
i' m dead if i don' t get that money .
look who flew the coop .
if it isn' t a $ 16, 000 man .
we don' t care what went wrong .
we just want our stake in the money back .
what' s the fuck' s the matter with you people ?
that money' s mine .
we don' t want trouble .
you want me to take it out of your ass ?
fuck you !
you want more , funny boy ?
christ .
where' s the money ?
i don' t have it .
well , you better find it .
jesus christ !
just give us the money .
i gave the money to my debtors .
all 16, 000 ?
i still owe another 5 to leo the lip .
he' s lying .
wait , wait .
i got the bellini .
i got cosimo' s bellini .
bullshit .
stick him again .
i swear to god !
i told him i got three years , and he gave it up to me .
so what ?
so i' il cut you in on it .
equal shares .
all of you .
it' s the greatest job i ever heard of .
a jewelry shylock .
let' s hear it then .
i can' t breathe .
let him up .
let him up .
you watch yourself , fucker .
fuck .
i feel weak .
shit .
jesus , we killed him .
the safe' s on the second floor of the pawnshop .
the apartment next to the pawnshop is empty .
we break into the apartment , smash a hole in the wall ... ... climb into the shylock' s and crack the safe .
that' s the easy part .
trouble is that building' s like a fortress .
the front door' s alarmed .
the best way is through the coal chute next door .
take the back fire escape to the roof .
then we drop to the apartment window , and we cut it open .
anybody know a safecracker ?
jerzy antwerp is the only one i know .
wait a minute .
hold him , would you ?
i got an idea .
i was thinking , with a camera , i could shoot the shylock opening the safe .
we could get the combination .
brilliant .
where we gonna get a camera ?
we could pay a little visit to a guy i know at the flea market .
so , what are you hocking today , riley ?
your kid ?
treat me with more respect .
it just so happens i came into some money .
i' m a buyer today .
it' s nice .
i like the browns .
yes , but what about the reds ?
what do you think ?
it' s for my sister .
is there too much red ?
she' s been institutionalized , and the color red makes her bark like a dog .
yes , after all , i believe there is too much red .
i' m sorry , oswald , but your paintings are crap .
let' s go to sears .
okay .
here we go .
what is this ?
sorry .
i shot some footage of him for his mom .
he' s a cute baby .
that' s his new food .
he' s not taking to it too well .
i like it .
riley , come on .
it' s good food .
you' re killing me .
here we go .
the hassenfeffer 622 .
is that good or bad ?
neither .
okay , okay , watch this .
seventy eight .
seventy seven .
eight .
seventy eight .
eight .
whoa .
jesus christ .
seventy seven .
what' s that number ?
seventy eight .
what is the number ?
it' s an eight .
seventy eight , eight .
that' s great .
we did nine takes .
every time , on the last number , he does this .
he' s like a gimp .
sorry .
so , what do you think ?
well , as a film , it' s a disaster .
it' s a documentary .
it' s supposed to look like that .
the good news is , the safe is crackable .
so how do we ... ?
what do we ... ?
how do we do this ?
do i carry you on my back ?
this may be a shock , but i don' t go out in the field anymore .
see .
what the hell' s he doing here ?
i teach .
for 500 bucks , i show you how to do it .
500 bucks ?
500 bucks ?
be quiet .
the baby .
we' re all tapped out here .
that' s why we' re doing this job in the first place .
we' il cut you in .
i don' t take back end money .
there' s a fortune in that safe .
five hundred bucks , that' s a deal .
my time is valuable .
all right .
hold on .
hold your horses .
can you get us through a krazner wall ?
well , who do you think krazner called ?
all right .
so then it' s a deal .
good .
be at my place saturday afternoon .
if you' il excuse me , i have a class to teach in youngstown .
five hundred bucks ?
did i mention i' m trying to get my wife out of the clink ?
where can we get that kind of money ?
we could mug someone .
there' s gotta be something .
i think i can get the money .
how much do you need ?
just a small loan for a new suit .
i met a nice girl .
i' m gonna ask her to marry me .
you' re getting married ?
lf she says yes .
so how much ?
five hundred dollars .
five hundred dollars ?
it must be some suit .
it' s beautiful .
with buttons and shoes .
well , i hope she can make an honest man out of you .
at the usual interest ?
at the usual interest .
we' re still better than leo the lip .
there are many methods to cracking a safe .
each method has an inverse relationship between quickness and cleanness .
the quickest is lipchiski method , named for its originator , theodore lipchiski .
the lipchiski method requires a stick of dynamite and a match .
very quick .
but as we learned when lipchiski blew himself up in toledo , it' s not clean .
hence , i teach the circular saw method .
not the quickest , but the cleanest .
you and your loot will emerge unharmed .
this is the method that i was taught .
it is what i believe in .
you want lipchiski , go somewhere else .
the police are here !
they' re coming !
they were just here .
hide the safe .
where ?
hide the fucking safe .
throw it off .
we can' t move it .
the cops are here .
you think that' s funny ?

i' m gonna fuck you up .
i hate that fucking kid .

you would' ve been so proud of me .
i never told you this before , but they were really terrible to me .
the things they would make me do .
they' re incontinent , for god' s sakes .
but then i met you , and you made me feel like i was worth something .
i thought , " i have pero .
i don' t have to take this crap no more .
so i called them " spoiled babies , " and they fired me .
they were so upset by it ... ... they canceled their stupid trip to steubenville tonight .
what ?
what ?

and i kept the keys .
we should go back and wreck the place .
my , my , my .
she didn' t turn the keys in .

if anything were to happen while they were away ... ... those old crows , they would blame me .
how could they blame you ?
you' re a small girl .
that' s nonsense .
could you do me a huge favor ?

could you take the keys on your way home ... ... and drop them off with the janitor ?
i would just sleep so much better .

you' re a small girl .
that' s ...

now let' s just shut up and get out the antwerp .

i need a breather , man .
so how much do you really think is in that safe ?

goddamn .
that' s a lot of money .
a person could live several lives with that kind of money .
i' m gonna buy a big loft with my share of the loot .
and one for my boy .
i' il pay them off so he never has to work a day in his life .
i' m gonna move to the country .
houses there are so far apart you can sit on your porch ... ... and read the newspaper in your underwear .
i' m gonna buy my wife a new gravestone .
you know , one that stands up .
with little angels carved .
in marble .
so , what are you gonna do ?
i think i' m gonna build a gym .
i know everybody thinks i' m not much of a fighter ... ... but i think i' d be a good teacher , you know , for the kids .
man , i can' t wait another minute .

i wooed the girl .
i paid off babitch .
i did everything .
i gave everything i had for this !

you gave us hope with your fucking bellini .
and then you ripped our hearts out , and you smashed them .
what is that ?

christ , i' m more broke now than when i started this fucking thing !
i wish i' d never met you .
any of you !
jesus , i think i' m gonna be sick .
i' m sorry .

sweet jesus .
hey , guys , take a look at this .
it' s a cookie jar stash .
there must be 1000 bucks here .
not a bad consolation prize , huh ?

the girl must have made it before they fired her .
i' m gonna heat this up .
at least we' il eat good before we go .
the pilot light must be out .
got a match ?
wait a minute .

i think it' s probably a good idea if we don' t see each other anymore .
wait a second .
i gotta give you your cut of the take .
it' s for your wife .
get her home .
thanks .
what are you gonna do ?
it just wasn' t our night .
i better get home and apologize to my sister .

if you get any more bellinis ... ... just give me a call .

i don' t know .
get cleaned up , and maybe i' il go see carmela .
that' s a good idea .
she' s a nice girl .
yeah .
i' il see ...
hey , this safe ... ... this job , it' s nothing .
it' s just money .
money comes , money goes .
i' m an old man , i know .
but to have someone ... ... somebody to walk with ... ... at your side ... ... is everything .
she' s a nice girl .
yeah .
yeah , she is .
