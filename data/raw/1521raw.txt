no , i meant , when we first got together , i said a lotta stuff about what i was gonna be , ... .. and i just wanted you to know that , uh ...
i wasn' t giving you some kinda line , ... .. that i meant it .
i didn' t marry you because i thought you were gonna be famous .
i just liked the way your ass looked in jeans .
i never wanted to be famous .
i just , uh ...
i didn' t expect to be ... so ...
what ?
i don' t know .
ordinary .
shhh .
hang on !
hang on !
you know , i hope it' s a girl .
i' m kinda sick of all these balls around the house .
except for yours , babe .
what are the odds on an educated single man being at this thing ?
and i don' t mean a ged !
does it matter if he' s on the boner pill ?
i wouldn' t look a gift boner in the mouth .

hey !

hey , tom , tom , tommy !

harry .
tom .
taking care of the place for me ?
we' re drilling holes all over your floors
i hope you don' t mind .
tom , you know my squaw sheila .
bobby , vanessa .
thanks for having me .
drink up !
take your medicine .
tom , how do you like the neighbourhood ?
i grew up in bridgeport , so it' s not like it' s a foreign country .
you' re goddamn right .
this is the best neighbourhood in chicago .
we all look out for each other .
that' s saying a lot as we approach the year 2000 .
are you running for mayor
hey , did any of you guys ...
.. see them crank dealers ...
what is lenny doing here ?
bobby , did you tell him you had a party ?
vanessa made me .
we invited everybody .
to actually invite this jack off ... !
oh , yeah , laugh it up
when you wake up dead with your throat cut , don' t come crying to me !
not attracted to .
not drunk enough for .
frightened by !
argh !
don' t touch me .
i' m fine .
haven' t you heard about people being operated on when they' re under hypnosis ?
yeah , but i don' t believe in any of that .
people who say they were hypnotised were just playing along .
right .
really ?
then how could they have a scalpel stuck into their throat without even bleeding ?
bullshit !
you never saw that happen !
that' s bullshit !
learn another word !
yeah , what about " narrow minded " ?
i saw a guy in my class get a two inch needle stuck into his arm by my instructor ...
.. when he was under hypnosis .
horseshit !
that better , honey ?
i saw a picture of it the next day .
it left a mark .
what i don' t understand is how a person that' s been to college ... .. can believe all that superstitious crap .
it isn' t superstitious !
come on !
i' m practically a licensed hypnotherapist .
" practically " ?
isn' t that like saying " i don' t have a licence " ?
ow !
my arm !
this may come as a surprise to you , but just because you lived here for your whole life ... .. doesn' t mean that there isn' t a whole larger world out there , ... .. doorways you haven' t even opened , things you wouldn' t have any understanding of .
doorways ...
ok , ok .
all right , kreskin , prove it hypnotise somebody .
yeah !
do me .
no .
why not ?
for one , you' re hostile .
i' m not hostile !
do i seem hostile to anybody ?
uh ... yeah .
thanks for having us .
it was a great party .
nah , nah , this is just getting good .
come on , lisa .
hypnotise me .
come on !
no .
you' re drunk .
i' m not drunk !
you' re not supposed to mesmerise somebody who' s been drinking !
mesmerise !
no !
stop !
oh , please !
i' m begging you .
educate the savages .
it won' t work with that kind of uncooperative attitude .
i swear to you , i' il follow every instruction to the letter .
it still won' t work .
come on .
what' s the worst that can happen ?
somebody turn out the lights .
oh , yeah !
whoo !
all right , just relax .
put your arm down .
just rest it comfortably .
just lean back .
just be very comfortable and relaxed .
trust me .
ok ?
close your eyes .
certainly , lisa .
now ... just listen for a moment .
listen to the sounds of the room around you .
i don' t know why , but i' m scared .
now i want you to pretend you' re in a theatre .
a movie theatre ,
you' re the only one there .
it' s one of those great old movie palaces .
when you look around , it' s a huge , empty theatre .
you notice that the walls of the theatre are painted in black .
the seats ... are covered in black .
and in the whole pitch black theatre , ... .. there' s only one thing you can see , and that' s the white screen .
you' il notice there are letters on the screen tall , thick , black letters .
but they' re out of focus , so you drift closer to them in your chair , trying to read them .
you' re very comfortable now .
it' s your favourite chair .
you' re drifting closer and closer , staring at the letters .
very relaxed now .
your legs are relaxed .
your arms are limp and heavy .
you' re almost close enough to read the letters now .
they start to come into focus .
the letters spell " sleep " .
sleep .
no !
what the hell was that ?
what ?
what ?
what ?
are you ok ?
you had to be faking it .
that was the weirdest goddamn thing i' ve seen in my life !
congratulations , tom !
you' re one of the lucky eight percent !
you still have tears on your cheeks .
what the hell did she do to me ?
christ , i' m thirsty .
whaddaya mean ?
what eight percent ?
there' s only eight percent of the population that' s , like , highly hypnotisable .
almost anybody can go under a little , ... .. but not way under not freaky under , like he did .
how' s your hand ?
whaddaya mean ?
i stuck a safety pin in your hand and asked you to bleed on one side , but not the other .
which i can' t believe you did !
you were very cooperative .
it was a side of you i hadn' t seen before .
that happened ?
you said it didn' t hurt .
to hell with the pin !
i wanna know more about your joey luca .
yeah , right !
who ?
joey luca is the kid who ... .. used to pound the shit out of you when you were 12 .
you told us all about it .
you were crying .
it was hysterical !
shut up .
it was very moving , tom .
joey luca !
jesus christ , i haven' t thought about him ...
hey .
can we go home ?
i ...
i feel kinda strange .
yeah .
yeah , sure .
close your eyes .
uh !
what' s the matter ?
don' t stop .
don' t stop .
ok .
ugh !
jesus christ !
oh , my god !
what ?
i i ...
i' m seeing things .
what do you mean ?
oh , no , no , no .
wait , wait , wait .
i i can' t right now .
then you were faking it extremely well .
ohh ...
wait .
stop , stop , stop !
it' s too weird .
baby , that wasn' t weird .
i could show you weird .
i felt like i was being attacked .
thanks
i' m sorry , i didn' t ...
i didn' t ...
i i ...
i' il be right back .
what the fuck ... ? !
ah ...
agh ...
agh !
arghhh ...
argh !
agh !
agh !
hey , jake .
you' re awake now , daddy .
are you ok ?
yeah .
yeah , i guess .
i just don' t feel so good right now .
don' t be afraid of it , daddy .
what was it , then ?
an hallucination ?
yeah , a bunch of ' em .
it' s like all these thoughts just kept coming .
you believe this ?
i got seven calls .
well , if it never happened before , it had to be the hypnosis .
i had this headache and i was thirsty as hell .
jake !
i know you' re not watching that monster tape again
who was the woman ?
i don' t know .
maybe somebody i was just remembering .
she didn' t look familiar .
did you fuck her ?
you gotta be kidding .
no .
i mean , was she someone you used to go out with ?
you' re jealous of my hallucination ?
hmm , you are pregnant !
you should call lisa .
no , she' s the one that fucked up my brain .
then she has to unfuck it .
ooh !
agh !
fuck !
fuck !
don' t swear so much !
hang on , hang on !
let me get my bearings here .
i have ...
i have absolutely no caffeine in my system , you know .
ok .
you' re asking me if i gave you a post ... .. posthypnotic suggestion .
did you leave anything else behind when you were inside my brain ?
nothing !
tell the truth , lisa .
tom !
please , this is insulting .
you know , i have done this before .
ok , good .
i i was ...
i was just making sure .
it was just a harmless one anyway .
what ?
did it actually work ?
what did you say ?
i don' t wanna tell you .
you' re grouchy .
lisa , i swear to god ... !
well , you know i' ve always said i think you need to be a little more open minded ?
yeah ...
so i just said that .
after you wake up , your mind will be completely open , like an open door , ... .. open to receive everything around you .
what' s that supposed to do ?
fuck if i know !
i never said it before .
why ?
did something happen ?
jesus christ !
relax .
ok ?
i opened a door , that' s all .
you know , therapists do it all the time .
it releases repressed memories , whatever you got back there .
for you , it was probably old mannixreruns .
i gotta get back to work .
ok .
alrighty , then
no !
no more calls for lisa !
hey , lise , it' s me .
call me when you wake up .
is there any way you could baby sit for us on friday ?
i did !
i told him !

huh ?
i said , call vanessa and ask her about debbie .
anyway , call me back .

his room' s upstairs , kitchen' s back there .

i think that damon kid is doing a great job and everything , ... .. and yeah , the kid' s got a decent arm , but high school football is about ... .. power , it' s about running the goddamn football it always has been .
what did you play in high school ?
piano , mostly .
oh , jesus !
sorry .
here , you want some ?
anyway , adam ... and i admit that i am biased , ... .. but my kid is having a helluva season and it' s like nobody even notices .
if they gave him the ball , he could break a thousand yards !
and that' s in an eight game season .
jesus christ !

frank says the average guy carries around a hard on two hours out of every day .
three for him .

i need to find a way to make her come back .
maybe if i hang out here long enough , ...
i' m talking to you ! .. maybe she' il come back .
maybe you could talk to her .
help me out here .
hey , come on !
hey !
what' s the problem ?
knock it off !
i don' t wanna talk about this because it scares mommy .
turn it up , man .
what ?

tom is looking especially together today .
he grunted a very pleasant greeting at me , actually .
he' s becoming sort of monosyilabic .
nothing wrong with that guy .
nothing a little lithium couldn' t cure !
i' m a jerk .
i' m sorry .
no ...
are you ok ?
over there !
in the door !
if you live on the base , your room and board' s covered .
you still gotta get up early .
i' il retire , make a coupla down payments .
when i take off the uniform , i' m a landlord already .
five years later , i got three houses .
hey .
hey , har .

samantha kozak .

brownish hair , 16 or 17 years old .

samantha .
oh , you mean the retard .

yeah , that' s right .
i remember that .
so , what about her ?
oh , i ...
i just been thinking about her a lot .
why ?
her sister baby sat for us .
oh .
this is the first time he' s been out in a week .
he hasn' t gone to work .
he sleeps 12 hours a night .
he' s used up all his sick days .
if he doesn' t show up on monday , they' il dock him .
i ...
i can' t get him more than six feet from the couch .
why ?
that' s where she appeared to him .
ah .
i' m not shocked that there' s another woman .
of course , the fact that she' s dead gives one pause .
we are talking about a ghost here , aren' t we , maggie ?
she took off , uh ... last march .
with a black guy , i think .
hey , harry .
did she ever live in our house ?
no , no , no .
i just ...
i just bought that one .
you' re the first tenants .
tom and jake , it' s like they have this private club or something .
they sit in the living room and whisper , and , as soon as i walk in , they both shut up .
you know what you need to do ?
find a young priest with smouldering good looks ... .. who can guide you through this .
i' m kidding , but i' m not .
look , i give tom a lotta shit , but the truth is , you guys are the best couple on earth .
this is on you now , maggie .
get some help .
find out why this is happening .
there is a reason .
you won' t be the first woman who' s had to hold an insane family together .
tom' s not crazy .
oh , yes he is .
but at least he' s getting interesting .
sports flash !
sports flash !
211 yards rushing on friday night .
that' s a total of 894 yards , with two games to go .
the kid needs 106 yards .
that' s 53 a game .
he could walk through the next two games and still break a thousand !
frank , what about you ?
do you know her ?

tom was asking about that kozak girl from over by baldwin .
you remember : the one who ran away ?
the retard .

look , man , this ain' t no freak show in here !
close the damn door !
look , you just gotta get outta here .
my husband is losing his mind .
i don' t know why , but i think you do .
you can tell me what you know , but you can' t tell me to go away because i' m not moving .
how long has he had it ?
just a few days .
what happened ?
a car wreck ?
no .
a child die ?
no !
did he kill someone ?
he was hypnotised .
is that what started it ?
it comes and it goes .
some people have it for five seconds .
some , their whole lives .
he' s a receiver now .
everything' s coming in .
he can' t stop it .
he can' t slow it down .
he can' t even figure it out .
it' s like he' s in a tunnel with a flashlight , but the light only comes on once in a while .
he gets a glimpse of something , but not enough to know what it is .
just enough to know it' s there .
jake , too .
your son ?
much better flashlight .
does he know what it wants yet ?
what who wants ?
he saw a ghost , didn' t he ?
what did it ask him to do ?
she didn' t ask anything .
maybe he wasn' t listening .
she' s asked for something , and now she' s waiting , ... .. getting more and more pissed off that he' s not doing it .
if he doesn' t do her thing , she' il never go away .
agh !
kill her !
kill her !
kill her !
agh !
agh !
hey !
absolutely not !
oh , please , please , please !

" the mummy " gives you nightmares .

i know .
i' m gonna take a bath .

how do i know this song ?
i know i know this song .
i know it .
i know it .
agh !

.. en este barrio de mierda a buscar un taxi .
i know .
i ...
well , gracias .
de nada .
ok , you gotta , uh ... slow down .
ok ?
you gotta be a little patient with me here cos i got a confession to make .
y' see , we ... we just smoked this great big fatty a few minutes before you walked in , ...
.. so this is blowing my mind a bit extra .
listen to me .
listen to me !
yeah ?
whatever ... door you opened in my brain , ... .. l want you to shut it .
now !
ok .
i' il do it .
ok .
i can do that .
close your eyes .
ok .
just like last time , i want you to just focus and concentrate .
listen to the sounds of the room , listen to the sounds of your breathing .
look at the back of your eyelids .
do you see anything there ?
could you just get to it , please ?
all right .
all right .
i want you to pretend you' re back in the movie theatre .
it' s very dark , ... .. and in the whole pitch black theatre , the only thing you can see is the white screen .
as you focus on the screen , you begin to drift closer to it in your chair .
you' il notice that there are letters on the screen tall , thick , black letters .
but they' re out of focus , so you begin to drift closer to them .
someone' s here .
no , it' s empty .
but there' s someone else in here .
no , you' re alone in the theatre , tom .
no .
no , i' m not .
your feet and your ankles are relaxed .
no .
hard to breathe .
your hands are limp and heavy .
your ... your arms ...
no air !
no air !
tom , i want you to look at the screen .
look at the screen .
hey .
you can read the letters now .
you' re right up next to them .
tom !
look at the screen !
no !
wow !
what ... what happened ?
are you ok ?
you need to sit down .
what was happening there was very next level .
you should have seen your face .
d' you want a beer ?
are you feeling better ?
what happened ?
i' m supposed to dig .
hi !
hello ? !
anybody home ?
wow !
look what i' m not cleaning up .

what are you doing ?
i' m supposed to dig .
whaddaya mean ?
i' m supposed to dig .
who says ?
i see .
and what' s jake doing ?
jake ... is helping .
why are you doing this ?
the water softens up the dirt .
no .
i mean ...
could you just stop for a second ?
tom !
can you turn around and look at me ?
what ... exactly don' t you understand ?
i' m supposed to dig .
why are you digging ?
i' m searching .
what are you searching for ?
the question is not what .
we both know very well what , even though we don' t wanna admit it .
the question , maggie , which you can plainly see i am very busy trying to answer ...
the question is where .
don' t worry , he' s ok .
it' s not over there .
we' re calling the police .
and tell them what , exactly ?
huh ?
practise it !
run it by me once .
i wanna see how it sounds out loud .
anything else ?
tom , why don' t you come inside with me ?
i wanna talk to you .
you' re not yourself right now .
this is just fucking typical !
now , what do you want me to do , maggie , huh ?
you want me to go inside and just , uh ... sit down on the couch in front of the tv ... .. and drink beer until i fall asleep , and maybe repeat the whole thing again tomorrow ?
be quiet !
and the day after and the day after ?
oh , just stop !
until ... until ...
until i ...
i grab my chest and die ?
i mean , this ... this is the most important thing that' s ever happened to me .
i mean , this is ... this is the most ... important thing ... .. that i have ever done in my whole life , in my whole stupid life !
and you want me to just stop ? !
no !
no , i won' t stop !
i won' t stop !
i won' t stop !
eight years , i' ve known you .
not once have you talked to me like this .
not once .
and if you do it again , i swear to god ...
and you know what ?
when you talk about how ordinary you are and your stupid life , ... .. you' re saying " our stupid life , " which i don' t think is particularly stupid .
so how the fuck am i supposed to feel about that ?
are you gonna drink that ?
i' m sorry .
ok , i' m not sorry .
who' s that from ?

my grandma' s going back in the hospital .
