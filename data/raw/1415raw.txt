yeah .
but , dude , how do you know when they' re ready ?
well , you never really know .

it' s the jellyman !

wait , wait , wait !
are you funny ?
where' s your shell ?
i need to breathe !
are you running away ?
did you really cross the jellyfish forest ?
did they sting you ?
one at a time !
mr. fish , did you die ?
sorry , i was a little vague on the details .
so , where are you going ?
you see , my son was taken .
my son was taken away from me .
no way .
what happened ?
no , no , kids .
i don' t want to talk about it .
aww !
please ?
please ?
well , ok .
i live on this reef a long , long way from here .
this is gonna be good .
i can tell .
and my son nemo ...
see , he was mad at me .
and maybe he wouldn' t have done it ... if i hadn' t been so tough on him .
i don' t know .
anyway , he swam out in the open water to this boat ... and when he was out there , these divers appeared ... and i tried to stop them , but the boat was too fast .
so , we swam out in the ocean to follow them ...
they couldn' t stop ' em .
and then nemo' s dad ... he swims out to the ocean , and they bump into ... ... three ferocious sharks .
he scares away the sharks by blowing ' em up !
golly , that' s amazing .
and then dives thousands of feet ... ... straight down into the dark .
it' s wicked dark down there .
you can' t see a thing .
how' s it going , bob ?
and the only thing they can see down there ... ... is the light from this big , horrible creature ... with razor sharp teeth .
nice parry , old man .
and then he has to blast his way ...
so , these two little fish have been ... searching the ocean for days on the east australian current .
which means that he may be on his way here right now .
that should put him in sydney harbor ... ... in a matter of days .
i mean , it sounds like ... this guy is gonna stop at nothing ... ... till he finds his son .
i sure hope he makes it .
that' s one dedicated father , if you ask me .

where' s nemo ?
i' ve got to speak with him .
what is it ?
your dad' s been fighting the entire ocean ...
looking for you .
my father ?
really ?
he' s traveled hundreds of miles , battling sharks and jellyfish ...
sharks ?
that can' t be him .
what was his name ?
some sort of sport fish .
tuna ?
trout ?
marlin ?
marlin !
the little clownfish from the reef .
it' s my dad !
he took on a shark !
i heard he took on three .
three sharks ?
that' s 4, 800 teeth !
after you were taken by diver dan over there ... your dad followed the boat like a maniac .
really ?
he' s swimming , giving it all he' s got ... and then three gigantic sharks capture him ... and he blows them up and dives thousands of feet ... and gets chased by a monster with huge teeth !
he ties this demon to a rock , and what' s his reward ?
he gets to battle an entire jellyfish forest !
now he' s with a bunch of sea turtles on the e. a. c ... and the word is he' s headed this way right now ... to sydney !
wow !
what a good daddy !
he was looking for you after all , sharkbait .
he' s swimming to the filter !
sharkbait !

good afternoon !
we' il have a great jump today !
ok , crank a hard cutback as you hit the wall .
there' s a screaming bottom turn , so watch out !
remember ... rip it , roll it , and punch it !
he' s trying to speak to me , i know it !
you' re really cute , but i don' t know what you' re saying !
say the first thing again .

dory , dory , dory !
now it' s my turn .
i' m thinking of something dark and mysterious .
it' s a fish we don' t know .
if we ask it directions ... it could ingest us and spit out our bones !
what is it with men and asking for directions ?
i don' t want to play the gender card right now .
let' s play the " let' s not die " card .
you want to get out of here ?
of course i do .
how are we gonna do that unless we give it a shot ?
dory , you don' t fully understand ...
