n urs e !
i put up with my mother in law for three months .
she finally croaks and her associate giv es her 500, 000 pes etas .
but my wife los es the che ck .
she said it was all my fault , that i was bad luck .
i blew up that fuck up was suddenly my fault .
do you hav e a picture of her ?
i' il find one .
i kicked her out of the hous e .
she slammed the door and all the papers went flying up in the air .
suddenly , a che ck for 500, 000 pes etas comes landing on my lap .
what do you think of that , federico ?
am i lucky or what ?
are you going to keep it ?
what ?
the che ck .
what do you think ?
horacio caparros , you are a lucky man .
no .
giv e it to me later .
it' s claudia .
pick up the phone .
i found fresh meat in that plane crash .
well , too bad .
since you' re on v acation , the y pass ed the file on to me .
tough luck , huh ?
this time , it' il cost you double
the y' re not all dead ?
all that for a measly 50 million pes etas .
or half if he surviv es .
if he had signed up for our life insurance plan , he' d get fiv e or six times as much .
that is 200 or e v en 300 million .
that' s mone y .
thank you .
claudia !
h i , old man .
h ello .
is that enough ?
it' s purely routine .
h e' s under arrest for theft .
i know .
will he get some mone y ?
h e surviv ed a horrific experience .
that mone y is his .
wait until he' s made his statement .
pleas e ...
i just need to make sure he signs it .
how much ?
what ?
how much will he get ?
25 million .
do you think that will make up for such trauma ?
that' s what he was awarded .
still a bargain for the airline .
two minutes ...
good e v ening .
good e v ening .
i' m with the insurance company .
i need to frisk you .
thanks .
i hav e the che ck .

she' s beautiful .
what will you do with the mone y ?
excus e me ?
how will you spend it ?
you' il cash the che ck in two days .
yes .
it won' t be of much us e where you' re going .
when i' m worried , i take out my cards .
it kills time and helps me clear my mind .
sometimes , just shuffling them makes my troubles go away .
if you draw an ace , i' il get you out of here .
we' re not betting anything .
tomas sanz , you are a lucky man .
sure .
don' t doub t it .
there' s one chance in a million for a plane to crash .
and for it to crash , leaving you the only survivor out of how many 23 7 pass engers ?
one chance in 23 7 million .
one more time .
no bets either ?
you play for me and you' re a free man .
play ?
play what ?
sorry , your time' s up .
we' re almost done .
so , will you sign it or not ?
we' il place our first bet with your compensation .
then we' il play with our gains .
in the end , we' il split e v erything 50 50 .
what if i los e ?
that won' t happen .
and what if it happens ?
you' re free to walk away .
how long will that last ?
two weeks at the most .
i don' t know how to play .
don' t you worry , you don' t need any talent .
just remember two things don' t e v er touch me
why not ?
just a thing i hav e .
and ne v er take my picture .
we don' t need any souv enirs .
remember it .
good e v ening .
hav e the y started y et ?
no .
do you want to s ee his i d ?
yes .
i don' t know him .
the plane lost contact with the control tower 1 2 minutes after takeoff .
the black box , which was re cently retrie v ed , should shed some light on the e v ents pre ceding the accident .
the casualty figures stand at 23 1 pass engers and six members of the crew .
the only person aliv e , tomas sanz , was arrested ...
are you here of your own free will ?
... accus ed of robbing a bank two months ago .
what does it feel like when a plane is going down ?
i was asleep .
come on .
you' re pulling my leg .
what' s this ?
what' s that smell ?
molass es .
that' s his favorite .
right .
place your bets , pleas e .
i' m sorry .
federico , you can' t be here .
h e' s new .
get him started and go .
h ere .
what' s this ?
no mone y bets .
it' s not mone y .
it' s a jewel .
the indemnity of the only survivor of the plane crash .
that' s right ...
i knew i' d s een you before .
i won' t play against him .
e v en this won' t do .
one of your fingers would be a nice trophy .
if he agrees , we' re game .
good idea .
so , federico ?
let' s play .
wait !
forget it !
come on , wait !
what about my finger ?
you won' t los e it .
right .
get lost .
thos e guys ... the y' re fucking amateurs who won a bingo game or fell from the s e cond floor .
the y hav e no chance against you .
i won' t do it .

you surviv ed a plane crash , i helped you get out of the hospital .
isn' t that luck ?
and so what ?
all you need in there is luck .
but i' m not stupid .
you are lucky and you can control that luck .
you' re fucking insane .
let me go or i' il touch you .
let me go .
why do you think you' re the only survivor ?
there were good people on that plane .
what sav ed you a thief ?
god ?
chance .
that doesn' t exist for you .
your gift is to steal other people' s luck .
otherwis e , you' d be dead .
right .
i belie v e in you .
but if you don' t , there' s nothing els e to say .
you can keep the mone y .
you mess ed up be caus e of a finger i would hav e wagered with you .

with a bug on my head ,
i made more in one night than in a lifetime of risking my ass !
you could hav e lost a finger .
so could you .
no .

yes .
wasn' t she going with you ?
she miss ed the plane .
how lucky .
how did she miss it ?
we need a phone .
we hav e to tell the bullfighter .
only fear makes for a great fight .
for a real bullfighter , it' s not the fear of losing , but the fear of suffering your own suffering and that of thos e around you .
it is that fear that driv es you to really fight .
why quit ?
you were ne v er injured .
i lost my fear of the bull .
you can' t fight the bull without fear .

let' s start from the beginning .
why didn' t you take that plane ?
it didn' t do you any good to leav e him and es cape the accident .
h e surviv ed too , and look where that led you .
your bad luck is tomas ' fault .
h e can go to hell .
i don' t belie v e you .
h e pre v ented me from taking that plane .
at the airport , he said ,
i don' t lov e you anymore .
h e sav ed my life .
what did you say ?
i don' t lov e you anymore .
is something wrong ?
why do we hav e a copy of caparros ' file ?
the court required one .

h is ex wife filed a complaint .
h e committed suicide , but she wants the insurance mone y .
and van kuipp life refus es to pay .

no one has surviv ed u canca in 30 y ears .
you bastard !
that' s where you were taking me !
you shouldn' t hav e lost .
that' s why i wagered ana .
what' s the game ?
you' re giv en a gun loaded with fiv e bullets .

if you kill him , you win .
if not ... the jew shoots .
fiv e to one ... could be wors e .
the guy who got luckier than you , died .
i make the de cisions .
who will you wager ?
the y took a plane to u canca .
why are you bringing me a los er ?
don' t play .
g rard told me you us ed his girlfriend without his knowledge .
nobody' s e v er come here out of lov e .
your boy des erv es to play .
i don' t usually talk to the people who come to play .
but this time ...
i want to make an exception .
look at this .
e v ery morning , the door of the barrack got opened , and the y took a few out .
first , the oldest ... then our parents , then the brothers and sisters .
in a couple of weeks , there were only about 50 of us left all children .
suddenly , the y just stopped coming .
then ... one day ... a man appeared .
h e was not a guard .
h e was wearing ... a sand colored suit .
spotless it was .
and he held a black handkerchief to his nos e .
we didn' t smell too good , you s ee .
and one by one , he took us by the arm and ... jolted our numbers down in his notebook .
we would be called and reunited with our parents .
and then he left and ne v er came back .
but the guards returned .
the y lined us up and shouted a number .
i looked at my arm ... it wasn' t me .
it was one of the others .
and as he walked through the door , he turned and looked at us all , thrilled to bits that he had won ... and disappeared .
and so on .
e v ery day , another number .
or two .
or none .
sometimes the y would just stand , looking at us , and then leav e .
in the end , only daniel and i were left ... for four days alone .
and we talked .
we talked a lot .
daniel knew things .
h e us ed to help his father at the watchmaker' s shop .
did you know that ... if you stare at the minute hand hard enough , you can s ee it mov e ?
that photo is of h elena , his sister .
daniel knew that it wasn' t our parents who would wait for us outside .
and the day the door opened again ,
i took my friend' s hand ... and i clos ed my e y es , willing it not to be my number .
when daniel let go of me , i couldn' t open my e y es again .
i didn' t want to look at him face to face .
h e just said to me , " it' s yours , " and walked off .
and ... he left the photo in my hand .
the next time the door opened ... the uniforms had changed .
well , if you' re ready , i think it' s time to play .
i found an ele v ator leading to the bas ement .
roberto ?
carlos , javier , can you hear me ?
federico , you hav e to go .
hav e faith .
remember that you came out intact .
i don' t lov e you anymore .
let' s get out of here !
your work is done .
leav e now .
god damn it , federico , our work is done .
come on .
we won .
no , you won .
take care of yours elf .
sara ?
