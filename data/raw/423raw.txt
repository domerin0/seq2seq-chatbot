people once believed that when someone dies ... a crow carries their soul to the land of the dead .
but sometimes , something so bad happens ... that a terrible sadness is carried with it and the soul can' t rest .
then sometimes , just sometimes ... the crow can bring that soul back to put the wrong things right .
over here .
there' s a piece of glass .
hey , sarge !

you must be awfully disappointed .
i got trouble .
one of my crew got himself perished .

you' re working for me tomorrow night , right ?
whatever you say , i can do .
good .
that' s very reassuring .
i still ain' t heard why gideon' s burned down .
ls that a natural catastrophe or act of god or something ?

nah .
you didn' t even slow down , you dickhead !
he couldn' t have stopped .
he was a buttface .
i could have made it .

i wish the rain would stop , just once .
it can' t rain all the time .

i kept asking questions and ... finally got busted for sticking my nose where it wasn' t wanted .
this your wife ?
yeah , we , uh well , not anymore , we' re getting a divorce .

last year over 200 blazes were reported , and 11 people lost their lives .
tonight may become the biggest and deadliest devil' s night ever .

that' s no reason to quit .
wrong .
best reason to quit .
only reason to quit .
a man has an idea .
the idea attracts others ...
like minded .
the idea expands .
the idea becomes an institution .
what was the idea ?
see , that' s what' s been bothering me , boys .
but i' il tell ya , when i used to think about the idea itself ... it' d put a big old smile on my face .
you see , gentlemen ... greed is for amateurs .
disorder , chaos , anarchy ... now that' s fun !
what about devil' s night ?

i started the first fires in this goddamn city .
before i knew it , every charlatan and shitheel was imitating me .
do you know what they got now ?
devil' s night greeting cards .

the idea has become the institution , boys .
time to move along .
you don' t want us to do " light my fire " time for the whole city ?
no .
no , i want you to set a fire so goddamn big ... the gods will notice us again .
that' s what i' m saying .
i want all of you boys to be able to look me straight in the eye ... one more time and say , " are we having fun or what ?
hey , you !
what' s your name ?
huh ?
skank !
you don' t feel that ?
i feel like a little worm on a big fuckin ' hook .

the whole city oughta be in flames by now .
sky oughta be red .
so that , i take it , is the late , great eric draven .
he has power , but it is power you can take from him .
i like him already .
the crow ... is his link between the land of the living ... and the realm of the dead .
so , kill the crow and destroy the man .
hmm .
i' m coming home , shelly .
you' re gonna say i shouldn' t be in the cemetery ... in the middle of the night , right ?
safest place in the world to be .
it' s ' cause everybody' s dead .
i knew you' d come here .
it' s really late , sarah .
you didn' t say good bye .
you' re just gonna have to forgive me for that .
and you' re never coming back .
i gave this to shelly once .
i think she' d like you to have it .

well , well .
why don' t you just give me a minute to think about that , huh ?
nah .
fuck it .
aw , fuck .
well , well , well .
it does seem to me that our little life has undergone ... a rather significant change in the past few minutes now .
wouldn' t you agree ?
well , for a ghost , you bleed just fine .
it' s still alive .
well , then kill it !
bye bye , birdie .
ah , shit .
well , just came by to pay my respects ... and here you are getting all shot up again .
they' ve taken sarah .
how many ?
two more .
i can handle it .
don' t worry .
i' m not worried .
look , here' s the plan .
you stay in front , and when they run out of ammo , i' il arrest ' em .
that sounds like a great plan .
there' s just one problem .
oh , shit .
you' re bleeding all over the place .
i thought , you know , you were invincible .
i was .
i' m not anymore .
well , i guess you really will need my help , won' t you ?
come on .
you take that .
you were supposed to stay behind me .
i think i messed up .
this is all the power you ever had .
now it is mine .
pity there' s not more time ...
... for us .
help , eric !
i' m scared !
let me go !
let her go !
you can have me .
i won' t fight you .
you can have me .
i won' t fight you .
all right .
no !
eric !
sarah ?
look out !
eric !
you know , my daddy used to say ...
every man' s got a devil ... and you can' t rest till you find him .
what happened back there with you and your girlfriend
i cleared that building .
hell , nothing in this town happens without my say so .
so i' m sorry if i spoiled your wedding plans , friend .
but if it' s any consolation to you ... you have put a smile on my face .
you got a lot of spirit , son .
i am going to miss you .
i have something to give you .
i don' t want it anymore .
thirty hours of pain !
all at once !
all for you .
yeah .
go help him .
are you alive ?
god , i need a cigarette .
everybody else dead ?
you helped me .
what you kept in here saved me .
thanks .
don' t mention it .
i' ve been meaning to come to church anyway .
oh , yuck .

stay with him until help comes .
he' il be okay , right ?

multiple homicides .
at least it stopped raining , huh ?
