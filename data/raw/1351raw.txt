do you know who shakeapeare was , sonny ?
he was the fellow who wrote the king james ' bible .
mr. , i don' t know what you are talking about ...
because you' re an ignorant irish welp !
just like your father .
that' s it .
tear my head off and destruct the world .
just like the other stupid irish in this country !
that' s why i never ran with your dad .
get off me you crazy bastard !
it means if you' re not strong , you' d better be smart .
i don' t know if your being too clever or too dumb .
but whatever it is , remember this much .
for all his faults , your father was a man who loved his people .
amsterdam .
amsterdam .
new york is calling you .
look at that .
what in christ' s name is that ?
rythms of the dark continent , thrown into the kettle ... ... with an irish shindig .
stir it around a few times .
poured out as a fine american mess .
a jig , doing a jig !
a little keep sake .
good on ya , sir .
come upstairs with me bill .
have i ever had you before ?
so you don' t call me by my christian name .
bill .
my god you' re alright !
i heard the news and came over as quick as i could .
as timely as the angel of death .
you' re not suggesting that i would stoop to what your suggesting ?
stop slabbering .
if i thought it was you ... ... you' d be in a wooden coat .
i' ve got a hole in my shoulder and it hurts ... ... so have a drink and shut up .
or shut up and get out .
i believe i' il have a drink .
carefull , tweedy the morts are frenchified !
no , i' m clean . go
jenny .
bill .
i' il wrap you up .
it' s gotta be tight .
loves to make me cry .
you can take it !
there' s my boy .
it' s alright .
to the butcher !
we' re all much obliged .
forever .
to the butcher !
why don' t you get out of here , johnny ?
go on .
go !
is there anyone in the five points you haven' t fucked ?
yes !
you !
belt down !
try it and i' il bite ya .
you were gonna bite me .
i dont think you want me .
find out .
oh , jenny !
i can' t sleep .
i hope you don' t mind us laying here , sir ?
whatever takes your fancy , young friend .
is your shoulder keeping you up ?
i don' t sleep too much .
i sleep with one eye open .
i only got one eye .
how old are you amsterdam ?
not too sure .
never did figure it .
i' m 47 .
47 years old .
you know how i stayed alive this long ?
all these years .
fear !
the spectacle of fearsome acts .
somebody steals from me , i cut off his hands .
he offends me , i cut out his tongue .
he rises against me , i cut off his head , stick it on a pike !
raise it high up , so all in the streets can see .
that' s what preserves the order of things .
fear .
that one tonight .
who was he ?
a nobody .
a coward .
what an end that would have been .
i killed the last honourable man 15 years ago .
since then ...
you' ve seen his portrait downstairs ?
has your mouth been glued up with juice ?
i asked you a question !
i said i' ve seen it , sir ...
you got a murderous rage in you .
i like it .
so much life boiling up in you .
that' s good !
the priest and me lived by the same principles .
only faith divided us .
he gave me this you know ?
that was the finest beating i ever took .
my face was pulp .
my guts pierced .
my ribs all messed up .
when he came to finish me ...
... i couldn' t look him in the eye .
he spared me because ... .... he wanted me to live in shame .
this was a great man .
a great man .
so i cut out the eye that looked away .
sent it to him wrapped in blue paper .
i would' ve cut them both out if i could afford being blind .
i rose up again with a full heart ... ... and buried him in his own blood .
well done !
he was the only man i killed worth remembering .
i never had a son .
civilisation is crumbling .
god bless you !
if you' ve got anything to say ... ... now is the time to say it .
who is he to you , jenny ?
i was 12 years old .
my mother was dead .
i was living in a doorway .
he took me in .
took care of me in his own way .
after they cut out the baby ...
he doesn' t fancy girls that scared up .
you should know , in your own mind ... ... that he never laid a hand on me till i asked him too .
who are you ?
who are you ?
gentlemen , you are most welcome to this palace of enchantment ... ... with visions to rival the tales of sheherazade and the arabian nights !
flex your head to the teutonic beauty !
feast you eyes on the magnificent blue ... ?
... of these creatures .
gentlemen , you see our caged birds well !
how would you like to make them sing ?
they could be singing for you .
may god put the spirit of the holy steel in my spine ... ... and the love of the blessed virgin in my heart .
amen .
easy now .
what did you say ?
he' s not who he says he is .
he' s not who he says he is ?
count you blessings he considers you a friend !
the only thing he considers every day and night is how to kill you !
those eyes want me to take them out for you !
i' il bury it up you fundunem where it belongs !
i can read right through them !
they' re empty ...
his name is vallon .
don' t do it bill !
his name is vallon !
curious people these celestials .
you know why they use short sleeves ?
so everyone can see he' s got nothing stashed .
i hope it doesn' t become a fashion .
johnny ?
get up !
ladies and gentlemen , if i may have your kind attention .
as some of you have surely noticed ... ... our friend and benifactor , mr cutting ... .. is tonight wearing a waistcoat of certain distinction !
may we appeal to him , to favour us ... ... with another exciting exhibition .
of skill .
courage .
daring and drama !
what' s gonna happen ?
the spider' s kiss !
the wheel of death !
william tell !
the butterfly !
the spider' s kiss !
the butcher' s apprentice !
the butcher' s apprentice !
a command performance !
where have you been ?
a command performance indeed .
i want you to get out of here !
and for this , i must beg the indulgence ... ... of my former ... ... assistent in matters of impailment ... ... the butcher' s original apprentice .
what do you say , jen ?
one more time for the sweet souvenir .
come on !
don' t do it !
she' il be alright .
remember this ?
of course !
you may feel more comfortable without that garment , miss everdeane !
you' il have to filch me a new one , bill !
anything in your pockets tonight ?
i ain' t started working yet .
what about that locket i gave you ?
apologies my dear .
pick it up .
whoopsie daisy !
now its good and broke !
i can' t seem to get anything right tonight .
you got the sand to give' m a grand finale ?
maybe when you' re aiming a little straighter .
enough of this heathen music .
get rid of these goddamn monkeys .
strike up boys !
this is a night for americans !
jenny !
hats off !
we hold in our hearts the memory of our fallen brothers ... ... whose blood stains the very streets ... ... we walk today ..
also on this night , we pay tribute to the leader of our enemies .
an honourable man ... ... who crossed over bravely .
fighting for what he believed in .
to defeat my enemy , i extinguish his life ... ... and consume him as i consume these flames .
in honour of priest vallon .
in honour of priest vallon !
that' s a wound !
i want you all to meet the son of priest vallon .
i took him under my wing ... ... and see how i' m repaid .
he saved my life one day so he could kill me the next ... ... like a sneak thief .
instead of fighting like a man .
a base defiler .
unworthy of a noble name .
that' il do mcgloin .
spread him out .
i hate blackies .
you .. you get to watch .
this is fresh meat !
we need to tenderise this meat a bit .
alright , lets kiss goodnight to that pretty face of yours !
no ....... !
what' il it be then .
rib or chop .
loin or shank .
the liver !
the spleen !
the kidney !
the lung !
the liver !
the tongue !
the heart !
the heart !
the heart ?
this boy has no heart .
then kill him !
he ain' t earned the death !
he ain' t earned the death of my hands !
he' il walk amongst you marked with shame .
a freak .
worthy of barnum' s museum of wonders .
god' s only man , speared by the butcher .
here .
here .
this way .
come on .
i want to show you something .
my mother' s bones share this grave .
i' ve saved 20 cents out of every dollar i' ve ever earned since .... ... i was thirteen .
that' s 215 dollars .
for bludgeoning and the rest .
this is what i wanted to show you .
this is where we' re going to go , as soon as you get better .... ... san fransisco , california .
you can have anything you want out there .
these men are pulling gold right out of the river .
with their own hands .
we' re here and need to get there .
start here .
go down ' round here .
up to san francisco .
the shortest way to go .
will you go with me ?
no need to fire that , miss .
or even aim it .
an audience with yor mangled friend is all i want .
i' ve 44 notches on my club .
do you know what they are for ?
to remind me of what i owe god when i die .
my father was killed in battle too .
in ireland , in the streets .
fighting those who were taking their privilege .
what only could be got and held ... ... by the decimation of a race .
that war is a thousand years old and more .
we never expected it to follow us here .
it didn' t .
it was waiting for us when we landed .
your father tried to carve out a corner in this country for his tribe .
that was him .
that was his dead rabbits .
i often wondered , if he' d lived a bit longer ... ... would he have wanted it to be more .
why did you rifle through his pockets then ?
for safekeeping .
i thought maybe you could do with it .
blood stays on the blade .
that' s a sorry looking pelt .
and it' s been so nice and quiet for the last three months .
tell me , this charge .
does it sit on easy with you ?
no .
not uneasy , bill .
i wouldn' t say that .
but ..... my allegiance is to the law .
i' m paid to uphold the law .
what in heaven' s name are you talking about ?
you may have misgivings , but don' t go believing that , jack .
that way lies damnation .
i' m in no danger of damnation , bill .
here' s the thing .
i don' t give a fuck about your moral conflicts ... .. you meatheaded shit sack .
that' s more or less the thing .
i want you to go out there .
you and nobody else .
none of your little minions ..
i want you to go out there ... ... and i want you ... ... to punish , the person ... ... who' s responsible ... ... for murdering this poor little rabbit .
is that understood ?
right !
help yourself to some decent meat on the way out .
damn it !
is that you , boy ?
i didn' t mean nothing by that shot you know ?
you scared me is all .
you know i' d never do you harm .
come out now , lad .
remember your father and me ?
are you to young to remember your uncle jack ?
the times we had .
you know i won' t hurt you .
this is bad for everybody .
what' s next , dead politicians ?
i could spare half a dozen of you ... ... easier than i can spare him .
still , i think it shows dash .
give the boy some time , we' il settle with a good dust up .
the lads !
there are more of us coming off the ships each day .
i heard 15, 000 irish a week .
and we' re afraid of the natives !
get all of us together ... .... we ain' t got a gang .. ... we got an army .
and all we need is a spark .
one spark , to wake us all up .
it was me who played you false .
i' d take it back if i could .
take it back ?
johnny , i ought to kill you !
get out of the points and don' t come back ..
where are you going , boil ?
come along .
come on .
tell us john , what' s the trouble ?
no trouble , bill .
still hiding out with your friends ?
you always were a native , as far as i' m interested , john .
till you became a stag .
you tell me you' re a native ?
do you want to know what a native is ?
a native is a man , who' s willing to give his life ... ... for his country .
like my father done .
are you willing to do that , my young friend ?
john ?
johnny ?
johnny ?
i' il get you off .
it hurts too much .
just kill me .
just kill me .
please .
please .
please .
please .
please .
i' m sorry , johnny .
oh , mary mother of god , pray for us sinners ... ... on the day of our death ... amen .
rest in peace , ma .
what are you doing here , boil ?
what' s that nigger doing in this church ?
what' s a dead rabbit doing with the natives, huh ?
no niggers among the natives .
niggers as robbers is one thing ... ... but niggers in a church , that' s something else !
you run with the natives , you go pray with the natives !
you' re going to wind up on a stake like your man did !
mcgloin ?
father !
jezus , do you know there' s a nigger in your church ?
jezus !
the earth turns ... ... but we don' t feel it move .
and one night you look up ... ... one spark and the skie' s on fire .
it' s a touching spectacle .
we' il come back when you' re ready for us .
the past is the torch that lights our way .
where our fathers have shown us the path .
we shall follow ..
our faith is the weapon most feared by our enemies ... ... for thereby shall we lift our people up ... ... against those who will destroy us .
our name is called the dead rabbits , to remind all of our suffering ... ... and as a call to those who suffer still ... ... to join our ranks .
however so far they may have strayed from our common home across the sea .
for with great numbers , must come great strength .
for the salvation of our people .
we don' t want your business .
how many other men live here ?
you all have to register .
you can' t force me to join no army .
have you got 300 dollars ?
of course not !
who the hell' s got 300 dollars ?
if you are drafted , release from militairy service can only be secured ... ... for 300 dollars , according to the conscription act .
300 dollars ?
otherwise you have to serve !
who the hell' s got 300 dollars ?
you have to serve , sir !
you tell me !
boys !
i was born here , sir .
you immigrated here ! .
sweet jezus .
war does terrible things to men .
get back up town , where you belong ! .
300 dollars .
it' s another rich man' s war !
sir , i request an audience with this man .
don' t they speak english in new york anymore !
don' t understand .
you do speak english !
i wonder if miss everdeane can angle her rifle in another direction ?
i wonder mr. vallon , if you understand the value of this sort of publicity ?
the archbishop himself , shoulder to shoulder with half the irish in the five points .
i' m offering my boy , to form an alliance with you ... ... against bill cutting and his slate of native candidates .
i' il negotiate a handsome fee , for every irish vote ... ... you send tammany' s way , in the coming elections .
i need a new friend in the five points , son .
i' d like that friend to be you .
now just a moment , mr. tweed .
suppose we do get you those votes .
would you back an irish candidate of my chosing ..
i don' t think so .
what if we get you all the irish votes ?
mr. vallon , that will only happen in the reign of queen dick !
beg your pardon ?
that means it will never happen .
now i might be persuaded to back an irish candidate ... ... for , let' s say alderman .
alderman ?
we' ve already got an irish alderman .
so we have , that' s why ...
what' s bigger than an alderman ?
sheriff !
sheriff !
alright , mr tweed , you back an irishman for sheriff ... ... of the city and county of new york .... ... and we' il get him elected .
i love the irish , son ... .. but higher than alderman you shall never climb .
why not ?
for one thing , no man living can consolidate the irish vote .
i can !
and for another , i mean no offence ... ... no one' s yet found an irish candidate ... ... for sheriff worth voting for .
monk !
here .
got me looking as sober as me own grandfather !
he was a great man , i' m sure .
he was a drunken bastard .
can i say what i want ?
that' s why i wanted you .
our elected representatives are a gang of thieves !
who swear to better our lot ... ... while dipping their hands deep into our pockets .
i stand shoulder to shoulder with community leaders like bill cutting ... .... against any , an all in roads in our democracy .
i' il see to it , that no one takes away ... ... what you earned by pluck and application .
to invading hordes of hibernians .
go to the polls and put your mark ... ... next to the name walter mcginn .
against the potatoes weeders , like them over there ... ... thieving our jobs .
why should so many irish die down south ... ... when the first war to win ... ... is not down in dixie , but right here ... ... in these streets !
who' s the finest streetfighter in the five points ?
monk !
that' s right and let the whole damn city hear it !
that man was right born for this .
he' s killed 44 men and laid low a couple of hundred more .
is that right ?
right .
i should have run him for mayor !
alright , line ' m up .
it' s election day !
come on , you bastard .
we need your vote .
bastard ?
i fought for you nigger ... ... i lost an arm for you !
well , that' s a start .
come on .
rise and shine , rise and shine .
this great country of ours , even hop fiends get their vote .
less heart and more haste , darling .
where are you going ?
i already voted today .
cast for monk and tammany , by god !
twice .
twice ?
only twice ?
you call that doing your civic duty ?
come with me .
oh no , you don' t .
get back and sit down .
here' s another one !
clean him up good .
shave the beards off boys and send them back to vote again .
what our great city needs is a new court house .
now i propose it should be a modest , economical structure .
excuse me one moment .
what is it ?
monk' s already won by 3, 000 more votes , then there are voters .
only 3 ?
make it 20 , 30 .
we don' t need a victory , we need a roman triumph .
we don' t have anymore ballots .
remember the first rule of politics ... ... ballots don' t make the results ... .. the counters do .
keep counting ..
it' s from bill .
monk ?
citizens of the five points !
mr. cutting is attempting to draw me ... ... into an argument ... ... that would no doubt end in bloodshed ... ... and the compromising of my office .
what do you think ?
shall i engage in silence , this relic of the ancient law ... ... or , shall i be your chosen voice ... ... in a new testament , in a new world ?
there you are , bill .
the people have spoken
the very notion of violent reprisal benumbs them .
come on up .
let' s see if we can resolve our ... ... grievances the democratic way ..
that my friends , is the minority vote .
now you tasted my mutton , how do you like it ?
notch 45 , you irish bug bastard .
why don' t you burn him ?
see if his ashes turn green .
fortune favours them all !
you killed an elected official ?
who elected him ?
you don' t know what you' ve done to yourself .
i know your works .
you' re neither cold nor hot .
so because you are luke warm ... ? ... i will spew you out of my mouth .
you can build your filthy world without me .
i took the father , now i' il take the son . me
you tell young vallon , i' m going to paint ... ... paradise square with his blood .
two coats !
i' il festoon my sleeping chamber with his guts .
as for you mr. tammany fucking hall ... ... you come down to the points once more ... ... and you' il be dispatched by my own hand !
now get back to your celebration ... ... and let me eat in peace .
i paid you fair .
down !
raise !
you son of a bitch !
challenge .
challenge accepted .
and then it came ... ... the first day of the draft .
thomas o' neill .
andrew lewis .
joseph flynn

j. b. gleeson .

rip' m apart .
kill the rich bastards .
hotel !
they' re not getting my son !
uptown town at the draft office ... ... the cops broke a few skulls .
and everybody ran away .
but the word was spreading ... ... in the dark .
up on fifth avenue , the schermerhorns and their mob ... ... breathed a little easy .
just a brief blist of anger , over mr. lincoln' s draft .
entirely justifiable in my view .
there are two sides to that question .
ther are several sides to that question , mr. schermerhorn .
but only one right side .
as with any question , it holds the abuse ... ... of any executive power .
in any case , mr. greely ... ... we can all be thankful , it wasn' t any worse .
it may be worse yet , sir .
i saw them .
i don' t know what to think ...
what is it you are so fond of saying , mr. tweed ?
mr. greely , you won' t like this ... ... but what is it ?
i don' t remember .
you can always hire one half of the poor ... ... to kill the other half .
i' ve come to say goodbye .
i' ve booked passage for california . see
jenny , give me one more day and i' il go with you .
you' il be dead by then .
what would you have me do ?
i don' t know .
this will all be finished tomorrow .
no it won' t .
this whole place is going to burn anyway .
i' ve heard of the poor are going from door to door ... ... in the five points , asking those supporters for further riots ... ... to place a candle in the window .
irish , poles , germans .
ah , mr. greely , the city is not mad ... ... i prophesise a dark night .
nobody goes to work today .
we' re shutting the factories down !
when the sun rose next ... ... the city had split in half .
from all over new york they came ... ... ironworkers , factory boys , street cleaners !
irish , polish , german ... ... anyone who never cared about slavery in the union .
anyone who couldn' t buy his way out .
let the sons of the rich ... .... go and die they cried .
let the sons of the poor ... ... stay home .
the earth was shaking now .
but i was about my father' s business .
oh , mighty lord ... ... you are the dagger in my hand .
guide my hand on this day of vengeance .
we give thanks to the lord .... ... for he is good .
with you , the swift cannot flee .
nor the strong escape .
let my sword devour , till its thirst is quenched with blood .... ... and my enemy sleeps forever .
for you and the god of retribution .
for the lord crushes the wicked .
the lord is merciful .
and his love endures forever .

we never knew how many new yorkers died ... ... that week , before the city was finally delivered .
my father told me we was all born of blood and tribulation .
and so then too , was our great city .
but for those of us who ... ... lived and died in them furious days ... ... it was like everything we knew ... ... was mildly swept away .
and no matter what they did to build this city up again ... ... for the rest of time ... ... would be like no one ever knew we were here .
