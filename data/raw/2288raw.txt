after fifty years of bitter warfare the eastern federation has beaten europa' s armies and taken control of the eurasian continent .
but pockets of resistance fighting the oppressive new regime , remain in eurasian zone seven .
the military mobilizes once again .
again , families must lose their sons .
i' m honored to present my findings to this forum of the health ministry .
gentlemen , as you know , we' ve beaten eurasia and brought it under control .
but the speed of our victory mustn' t stop us looking within .
our nation' s health is in crisis .
radioactivity ... industrial waste ... chemical weapons have poisoned us .
environmental diseases are epidemic and a threat to our future .
genetic mutations are rampant .
beyond the reach of current medicine .
allow me to present my findings .
these are " neo cells " , the fruit of my years of study .
i found them in the genome of a primitive ethnic group .
they can be converted into any cell to regenerate human tissue .
all of the internal organs , nerves , bone , skin , hair ... everything can be cultured and harvested at our convenience .
simply put .
spare parts " for the human machine .
with no risk of tissue rejection the medical technology of our dreams is finally at hand .
can we use it now ?
with funding , it' s a matter of time .
our clone work is years ahead of you !
it' s just a theory !
father , must you listen further ?
yes , it' s theoretical but if i get funding and the facilities i need , we can save our people .
think of your children ... your parents ... and your wives .
luna ...
when the war ends , let' s get married .
sure .
is this what we fought for ?
fifty years of struggle to end up too exhausted to rebuild our society ?
i read your paper .
human regeneration technology
a dream come true ... ... if it' s possible .
it' s definitely possible .
with more research , right ?
professor azuma , those fools won' t recognize your work .
in fact they daren' t .
it' s taboo to suggest , our original genes need improving .
pardon me .
i' m kaoru naito of nikko hairal inc .
we' ve already built a lab to host your research .
how come ?
the military' s taken an interest .
general kamijo ?
the defense ministry is at your disposal .
sorry to hear your wife is unwell .
what' re you getting at ?
work with us ...
let all our dreams come true .
azuma residence
azuma residence dr. kozuki , move to the right .
dr. kozuki , move to the right .
that' s it .
maybe place a hand on your daughter' s shoulder ?
okay , that' s wonderful .
smile , please .
is your mind made up ?
yes .
with your mother ill ?
and what about luna ?
i can' t stay here while my friends are fighting .
you hate being a doctor that much ?
it' s my duty to my country .
you' ve no idea what war is like .
it can' t be worse than cowardice .
darling ...
let' s not fight today ...
forget it , mother .
go ahead , please .
luna ,
congratulations on your engagement .
thank you .
kozuki , excuse me .
my new lab opened last week .
one year later
eurasia , zone seven
shoot , shoot !
kill her .
do it or you' re next .
understand ?
midori ...
be patient .
i' m going to find a cure .
grenade !
eastern federation , defense ministry
eastern federation , defense ministry culture lab .
one moment , please .
dr. kozuki is downstairs .
bring him up .
up here ?
that' s right .
right away .
impressive security .
sorry for the sudden invite .
is luna with you ?
she' s in the lobby .
midori wanted to see you both .
a nice idea after so long .
she must get lonely .
has it been a year already ?
thanks to my son ...
luna must be suffering .
still no word ?
not to me , at least .
he went to war to spite me .
sons always defy their fathers .
he despises me .
i put my work before family but can' t even cure my own wife .
isn' t the neo cell treatment nearly ready ?
it' s incredible what you' ve done ...
usable ?
no .
fixing wounded men with new organs ... makes my armor research redundant .
it' s far from complete .
and i' m out of time .
is she that ill ?
she' s almost blind .
still doing research , though ...
there' s selective leaf decay and darkening overall .
poor nutrition , perhaps ?
how about the others ?
here they are .
did you hear something ?
no , i didn' t .
i think someone just arrived .
i' m sorry .
would you go check ?
certainly .
mother .
i' m home .
can you find a cure ?
then , shouldn' t you be with her ?
i mustn' t give up .
yes ?
no ...
tetsuya .
i' m so glad you' re home safely .
we must be thankful .
did you see luna , yet ?
i' il see her soon .
you must .
she waited so long .
i know ...
i' m so forgetful .
they' re coming for dinner tonight .
it' il be such a surprise .
ikegami san , ikegami san !
professor !
what' s wrong ?
my son ... he' s dead ...
september 16th , sergeant azuma , made the final sacrifice ,
losing his life in duty for god and country .
a most ... a most noble and heroic end .
after posthumous promotion , he' il be buried tomorrow .
tetsuya !
a state funeral with full military honors .
you may view the body tonight .
please get ready .
luna ...
i messed up ; now you' re alone .
we had all the time in the world , so i took you for granted .
i know it' s too late , now ... but i' il never leave your side again .
his body' s on the way here .
the funeral' s tomorrow .
did you tell midori ?
she already knows .
warning
malfunction !
pressure overload .
cause unknown !
osmosis tank failure !
shut down the vacuum feed .
what' s going on ?
what the hell' s that ?
culture fluid' s transforming .
what the ...
the neo cells ...
it' s the neo cells .
organs are recombining .
professor , what' s going on ?
what the ... ?
what is it ?
code 206 , code 206 !
it' s me , naito !
get in here , now !
professor , let' s go !
open up !
we' re still in here !
they' re coming ...
go secure the overflow !
hold up !
set up an outside perimeter .
who said we take orders from you ?
the whole project' s my responsibility .
grunts shut up and do as they' re told .
all of you , outside !
get me h. q.
luna ...
what happened ?
naito here .
i' m inbound .
i' il report when i get in .
mother ...
tetsuya ...
they' re escaping by vehicle .
with a hostage .
seal off eurasian zone three .
where' s my wife ?
hold on , my dear .
azuma .
what' s going on ?
are you out of your mind ?
your son is dead .
i don' t want to come back .
please .
stop !
give me a hand .
how on earth can this be ?
you can escape through that door .
look after tetsuya .
you mustn' t die .
hold on !
don' t die .
don' t die .
dear god ...
what have you done ?
what ?
foreign agitators are still at large .
heavily contaminated with infection , please report their presence .
let' s see i. d.
please proceed .
it seems they' re heading for zone seven .
kozuki residence .
this is the body armor i developed .
it completely shields the soldier and lets him move like lightning .
tetsuya' s muscle is so over developed he may tear himself apart .
we must contain the internal pressure .
sekiguchi !
hold on !
sekiguchi , don' t die !
mother ... ... you so hated the war .
wondered when it would end ...
how many would have to die ...
if peace would ever come ...
we live !
against all odds , we survived .
did men recognize our right to life ?
no .
they murdered our brothers .
as if they had the right to judge .
as if they deserved such power .
we have equal right to life .
it can' t be rationed .
nor denied at birth .
no way .
of course it can' t !
but man presumed to judge us .
if they claim this right , then so can we ...
we' il have our revenge .
we' il build a kingdom here .
live our lives to the full and do what we must .
let us be called " neo sapiens
we hereby vow
to eliminate mankind .
we are the neo sapiens .
bow down before us .
are we ready for the next offensive ?
yes .
two divisions are standing by .
intelligence reports eleven scientists in the target area .
roboticians , nuclear physicists and an armor specialist .
perfect for our new factory .
is it ready ?
bring me those scientists .
let them contribute to our power .
forget it .
reports indicate military scientists being abducted to work in robot factories .
our military is strengthening defense of civilian installations .
that' s as much as i can do .
it' s not perfect but it' il stop him bursting apart .
father ?
dr. kozuki , armor specialist .
he' s ours now .
puny human .
tetsuya ?
my boy ...
my boy ...
fate has something in store for you .
it' s going to be tough .
but ...
there' s got be a reason for it .
there must be ...
you must seek out your destiny .
luna .
i' m sorry .
never look back .
father !
tetsuya , get up .
come on .
tetsuya , wake up !
where is she ? !
who the hell are you ?
where is my mother ? !
you' re supposed to be dead .
tetsuya ...
stop .
stop !
get lost !
move !
go away , freaks !
are your " neo cells " ready ?
i can' t afford to wait .
what use are you , if you can' t deliver ?
no more excuses , naito .
as selfish as ever .
all you think about is yourselves .
how dare you !
old farts saving their own skins .
even for the general' s son , this is unforgivable .
our nation faces the neo sapien threat yet your only worry is your health ?
that' s unforgivable .
son .
you know this is treason ?
of course .
the eastern federation is now mine .
sorry .
the era of brain dead idiots is over .
son !
satisfied , now ?
commander kamijo .
let me introduce
professor azuma .
father of the neo sapiens ?
why did you lie to him ?
that' s strange .
i thought you' d be pleased .
i didn' t create them .
i don' t know how they came to life .
it' s too late to claim ignorance .
they grow stronger by the day .
if we don' t find their weakness , learn how to fight them ... our own lives may be in danger .
keep up your research .
in return , the army will find your wife .
stick to the story , old chap .
don' t rock the boat .
your time has come at last .
why must people always fight ?
who did this ?
we' re hurt , so we hurt in turn ...
we' re killed , so we kill in turn ...
endless repetition .
i can see it .
what must i do ?
what can you see ?
a vision ... of how it might' ve been ...
and now ... my own father killed ...
what should i do ?
what would be best ?
of peace ...
shall i get a gun and kill ?
if it' d taken away the pain .
should i fight , too ?
stop talking nonsense .
but you fought ?
it' s my duty .
you wanted to go to war .
you' ve no idea what war is like ...
you' ve no idea what war is like .
you' ve no idea what war is like .
