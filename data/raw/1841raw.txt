i' m listening to the news .
i' m on my way .
arsinoe , i have to go .
see you tonight .
i may be a little late .
not too late , i hope .
good morning .
has general dobrinsky arrived ?
yes , general .
morning , sergei mikhailovitch .
morning , fyodor alexandrovitch .
you' ve seen the election results ?
bad news for us .
it depends .
the communists are refusing to share power on stalin' s orders .
remember dimitrov' s speech to the 6th congress of the international ?
the masses in the democracies aren' t ready to rise up .
not ready to rise up .
nothing' s changed .
you' re sure ?
i' m more than positive .
believe it or not , moscow thinks a revolution would weaken france and swing the right towards hitler .
they' re no fools .
they' ve got their feet back on the ground , in any case .
they' ve put world revolution ...
on the back burner .
on the back burner .
in that case , long live stalin !
no french revolution for him .
so i needn' t fear too much unrest in my factory ?
trust him .
he' s very well informed .
he' s never made a false prediction yet .
strike action
the strike has spread to many trades and changed the face of paris .
we will fight to the last for our demands in peace and dignity !
agreed , comrades ?
for our demands !
coming !
hello .
i live upstairs .
won' t you come in ?
the concierge gave me this by mistake .
it' s for ...
mr voronin ?
thank you !
yes .
she can see the pictures .
very pretty .
which market is it ?
it doesn' t exist .
i invented it .
i don' t like painting outdoors .
i make sketches and then paint at home .
i' d never dare set up my easel in the street .
parisians are nice people but they stare and it bothers me .
so , dearie ... what' s that lady doing ?
she' s shopping .
and this one ?
she' s the stallholder .
what' s your name ?
we call her dani .
she' s feeling shy .
it' s natural .
i must say she' s adorable .
i hardly dare ask you ... could i paint her ?
she might not feel comfortable here .
there' s no school today , thursday .
could you come upstairs ?
gladly .
i prefer to draw people in their usual setting .
can i say that ?
we' d probably say " in their natural habitat .
are you russian ?
not me .
i' m greek .
my husband' s the russian .
we met in a sanatorium in greece .
he was recovering from a war wound .
now he works for the russian army veterans association .
we' ve been married twelve years but we have no children , much to my sorrow .
he has a son in russia , living with an uncle since his mother disappeared .
fyodor , my husband , gets letters to him but he can' t visit him and sasha can' t come here .
so that' s my life story .
is she being good ?
good as gold .
i' ve finished for today .
may i see ?
fernande ?
if you see any new carrots , please buy me a pound .
yes , ma' am .
amazing !
you have such a talent for likeness .
my memory is mainly ... visual .
come into the parlour .
i' d like to sketch her a few times in various poses and do the painting down at my place .
if you need her there , we can find a time .
no need .
i' d rather not bother you .
i have plenty of free time .
my husband , andre , and i are both schoolteachers .
he teaches history at lycee pasteur , i' m at victor duruy .
guess what i teach .
classics .
that means latin and greek .
ancient greek , though .
it' s very far from modern greek .
not that far .
some words are the same .
for example , to vima .
i' m lost .
it means " tribune " or " step " .
it' s the name of a prestigious newspaper .
i pronounce it bema .
now i' m lost !
who is she ?
the girl from upstairs .
i met her mother today .
she' s very nice .
she let me sketch her daughter .
do you like it ?
guess what she does .
she teaches greek .
ancient greek ?
her french pronunciation baffles me .
i understand russian better .
did you meet the husband ?
he was at a meeting .
a party meeting , probably .
he' s a communist .
who says ?
i saw him in the street reading i' humanite .
it' s my job to know everything , anyway .
is it awkward ?
that he' s communist ?
bear it in mind .
did she ask you about me ?
come to think of it , yes .
i told her you were in the white army .
shouldn' t i ?
i don' t hide it .
he' s a teacher too ?
history .
intellectuals !
they' re the most dangerous .
are you scared ?
are you spying on them ?
this is for you .
keep it .
how can we thank you ?
let me use the spare sketches for another painting .
if you like .
a painting of what ?
i don' t know yet .
have you finished your previous one ?
why not come down and see it ?
now ?
why not ?
but i doubt it' s your kind of painting .
a russian !
n. goncharova .
you know her ?
but i can read russian .
this etching' s by picasso .
unsigned , of course , or we couldn' t afford it .
not your taste ?
it' s not that .
i just don' t understand it .
you' il understand mine but not like them .
it' s not quite finished , but still ... it' s very lifelike .
this man is exactly the same as that man , there .
i always do sketches .
don' t look at that old stuff .
on the other hand ... this one ... is newer .
interesting composition .
this one' s older but ... i like it a lot .
delightful .
yes .
and there' s this .
dani loves it .
is your art for yourself or to sell ?
i' ve sold some to friends , but even that is hard .
i' d like to exhibit but the costs are huge .
there are more next door .
come .
the colours are beautiful .
you feel it' s winter .
your paintings focus on people .
in france , landscapes are the thing .
the french don' t care for genre painting .
you' re right .
here' s my husband .
have you met ?
fyodor , our new neighbours , mr and mme passard .
my wife tells me you' re teachers .
i' m a soldier .
i work for the russian veterans association .
i run their external affairs .
strangely , the russians would like this more than the french .
true .
the french don' t care for everyday scenes .
and russians care even less for cerebral art .
you mean abstract art ?
what about malevich , kandinsky , pevsner ?
aren' t they russian ?
i' ve heard of them but they left russia .
monsieur likes cubists .
picasso , braque , juan gris ... horrible !
i don' t know the others .
cubism , i don' t understand and don' t want to .
you sound like stalin .
i may be a white but the reds aren' t all bad .
as a red myself , i' d say russia' s all good except that .
for an artist or intellectual living in a bourgeois society , to shun academic art is a revolutionary act which may be superseded in an already socialist country .
your marxist dialectic doesn' t sound very orthodox !
june
it' s true .
it' s a nice change from bolshevik art .
all those avant gardists , cubists , and other " ists " .
the soviets can' t stand them !
for once , they' re right .
my husband says many modern artists in france are russians , who even fought in the revolution .
our communist neighbours upstairs have a picasso .
how do you know ?
did you visit ?
yes .
they' re very nice .
i' m painting their little girl .
here she is .
be careful .
they could spy on you .
spy on what ?
every red in france and russia must have a file on fyodor .
i presume he' s on his guard .
i don' t know .
he doesn' t seem afraid .
which one shall i take ?
i love this one .
you can smell the grass !
but i prefer this one .
i painted it by the sea with fyodor .
those swimsuits are passe !
i' il take it and hang it in my salon to drum up business for you .
interesting art is hard to find since painting went over to the bolsheviks ... pardon me , to picasso and his ilk !
how much do i owe you ?
i don' t know ... that' s far too much .
change of cabinet premier albert sarraut and his ministers present their resignation to the president .
soon after , mr leon blum is invited by president lebrun to form a new cabinet .
within hours , mr blum announces his cabinet , including , for the first time , three women .
amazing .
the reds have turned tricolour !
tricolour flag flies over republic !
homage to rouget de lisle .
see ?
i was right .
the revolution' s nowhere near .
we consider impossible
any policy that , given the nazi threat , could jeopardize france' s security .
says who ?
l' humanite .
bravo , gentlemen patriots !
and how about this ?
this is no time to take power .
every strike must have its end .
bravo , comrade thorez !
uncle joe taught you well .
how do you know ?
believe me .
i' m well informed .
soviet policy' s shifting .
it doesn' t bother us whites , but ... i wonder how our neighbours upstairs explain this u turn .
what about the strikes ?
what do i think ?
my party has no hand in them .
they' re a gut reaction by the workers .
but do you approve ?
that' s beside the point .
they' re a fact .
the party must take note of it .
an embarrassing fact ?
like any unforeseen event , but politicians have to adapt .
i quite agree .
but as a citizen yourself , don' t you have a gut reaction ?
of course .
i react with surprise and expectation .
no hostility ?
no true communist opposes the will of the oppressed .
still , i was quite alarmed to see trotskyists and pivertists proclaiming the french revolution .
why do you communists oppose revolution ?
we oppose an abortive revolution that would surely end in repression , snuffing out the fresh hope lit by the popular front .
when trotsky says that to ally with the radicals against fascism is " criminal and idiotic " , i realize his mental faculties have dimmed .
he' s the idiot , blind to the changes wrought by fascism and nazism .
we communists will link arms not only with radicals and socialists but with all democrats .
petit bourgeois , catholics ... orthodox ?
and protestants , of course , muslims in the colonies ... even white russians .
even generals ?
yes , now they' ve disarmed .
forgive me , but did you serve as a general ?
in the civil war .
i was 22 .
a general at 20 ?
that beats napoleon .
but my career was shorter than his .
had i turned red , i might be commander in chief by now ,
like my classmate , mikhail nicolayevitch tukhachevsky .
but i' m in exile , a pen pusher despite my bombastic title .
i was , and still am , at war with the reds .
we disagree but life often throws us together .
tukhachevsky , commander in chief of the enemy army , is a old friend of mine .
my own brother served under him .
and fate has dealt you a red neighbour in france .
i won' t conceal that part of my job is to prevent soviet agents from infiltrating us .
it' s no secret to anyone , least of all to your party .
but nothing happens , anyway .
we no longer interest the soviets .
you know what dimitrov said last year ?
to us , the white army is like a flea jumping 1, 000 miles from an elephant .
our main concern is to prevent a repeat of 6 years ago , when the soviets kidnapped ... general kutyepov , yes .
but there' s no proof that the ussr ...
let' s not get into that .
the fact is , kutyepov disappeared .
he was popular and determined , therefore dangerous , which i can' t say of our incumbent chairman , the innocuous general dobrinsky .
july the spanish rebellion
everywhere , workers , youngsters and women join forces to quell the rebellion .
in the sierra de guadarrama , carlists and republicans fight mercilessly .
the rebels try to take madrid , attacking from north and south to strangle it into submission , but workers ' militias foil the enemy and control the key points of access to the capital .
have you spotted dani ?
it' s typically her , pensive among playing children .
i' il show you something .
magnificent !
i' m not sure it' s very like her .
it' s her exact expression .
a bit sad ... not sad , pensive .
she' s a very introverted child .
you know that word ?
in greek , esostrephis .
i understand .
eso , inward .
strepho , turned .
for once i understand modern greek !
it' s yours if you like it .
but i' m not sure it' il fit among your picassos ... it will !
i' m delighted .
i' il put it in her bedroom .
come and see .
i thought i' d hang it here .
the colours go well with the room .
i' il pay you for it .
certainly not .
a price between friends .
it' s a present .
you had to buy materials .
you can buy the frame .
let' s have a drink .
... to save the spanish republic .
it' s now or never .
shirking it now means war in two years .
it' s sad , us leftists quarrelling over spain .
i hope your russian friends aren' t for intervening ... on franco' s side .
i' ve no idea .
i' ve been too wrapped up in my painting to read the papers .
hasn' t your husband said anything ?
him ?
he' s very discreet .
we seldom talk politics .
also , he' s been away a lot lately .
peace rally the peace rally unites hundreds of thousands in their hatred for war and faith in peace .
premier leon blum speaks .
to desire peace is not only , on the brink of a great international crisis , to cling stiffly on in desperation to prevent mankind from rolling into an abyss !
it is something more .
it is to pose as prerequisites all the means and all the conditions of peace .
goodbye .
till thursday .
send me a postcard ?
love , fyodor .
january 1937
alexei !
good to see you !
you' re in paris ?
yes , i work as a taxi driver .
arsinoe , meet my cousin , prince alexei trofimovitch cherepnin .
pleased to meet you .
you' re not getting away without lunch .
see , i make a decent living but i' d rather be doing something more ... prestigious .
can' t you take me on the white army staff ?
i' m afraid not .
our association' s very poor .
we live mainly on treasure we brought out of russia , but poor dobrinsky made some dire investments and we' re almost broke .
cheer up !
driving a taxi is as honourable and less dull than pushing a pencil .
maybe i should follow some of my friends and join franco' s army .
i advise you not to .
he wants to fight for franco .
why not ?
have you gone communist ?
i live in a communist country , or almost .
i' m responsible for our association .
our host government opposes the spanish nationalists , without officially helping the reds .
i know , some of our association disagree with me .
dobrinsky wanted me to second franco at salamanca .
i refused .
he gave in .
i' m gaining power over him .
they say he' il retire soon and you' il replace him .
if i do , i' il give our venerable association a thorough shake up .
in what way ?
by flushing out nostalgic and revanchist sentiments .
must we abandon our motherland to its fate ?
what can we do ?
but don' t worry , i still think communism' s a utopia , bound to collapse from within .
the bolsheviks won' t go until it does .
they seem to be running out of steam , or else wising up .
world revolution is off their agenda .
do you swallow what they say ?
the thing is , they don' t actually say it .
did you read last week' s i' echo de paris ?
those bogus party orders to murder all officers on the big night ?
big night , " my foot !
you fell for it ?
it' s a fake , planted by ultra militarists and corvignolles agents .
the cagoule' s military wing , to be precise .
heard of it ?
you seem well informed .
who told you ?
i never name my sources .
and how do you know i' m not a cagoule member ?
if you were , you wouldn' t say .
don' t bet on it .
sometimes it' s wiser to be truthful than lie , so you won' t be believed .
don' t you believe me ?
you' re right there !
i have to go .
back to work .
taxi work .
thank you very much for lunch .
see you soon .
very soon .
your cousin seems very curious .
it' s normal .
he' s briefing himself .
i have an exaggerated reputation for omniscience .
i like to lay the odd " red herring " , as they say .
but not with him .
he' s too nice .
i pity him .
he seems happy enough .
he has dignity .
he' s not cut out for exile .
he' s lucky he can drive a car .
it' s humiliating work for a prince but russians have a yen for humility .
not me , though .
thank god , i don' t humiliate myself .
nor do i give orders , at least not openly .
i pull strings .
what strings ?
i know what you mean , but how ?
that ... is a trade secret .
a state secret , even .
can' t you decide ?
what is it ?
no , nothing .
i was thinking about what i said at lunch .
your cousin wasn' t all that curious .
it was you who seemed ... talkative .
i could have been shorter with him .
he' s no humourist but he' s a good fellow .
it' s not about him .
in company , i learn things about you that you never told me .
what things ?
for example , you wouldn' t attend that conference in spain .
didn' t i tell you ?
perhaps not .
i didn' t think you' d care .
i don' t tell you everything .
you tell others more .
even our communist neighbours .
naturally .
whites , reds , they live for politics .
you have your art .
i care about politics too , you know !
which is why , when we speak russian , i translate for you .
thank you .
you discuss politics with me but not your politics .
i don' t go in for politics .
so you have no state secrets ?
some .
but as for the other ... non secrets ?
you don' t tell me either !
i have to learn about them second hand .
such as ?
your refusal to go to spain .
i didn' t think you' d be especially interested .
i said it before and i' il say it again .
excuse me , but it' s not up to you to decide what interests me .
you confide more in strangers than in your own wife !
of course .
would you want me to tell you everything ?
everything i can ?
no , fedya .
i' m exaggerating .
but today i' il tell you something i' ve never said before .
it may upset you .
we' ve never said a word against each other before .
you know how i love you the way you are , with your qualities and foibles , which everyone has .
the one thing that bothers me about you and could slightly put me off you is the way you try to justify your ... reticence ?
i think that' s the word .
they' re not lies , not even of omission , but ... with me , you treat state secrets the same as common knowledge .
maybe , but only because i don' t mind lying to others .
to you , i mind .
you said just now you never lie .
i was joking .
in my job , called euphemistically ...
you know that word ?
of course .
it' s greek .
to embellish verbally " .
in my job , called euphemistically " intelligence " , not to say " espionage " , it' s very hard to tell what' s secret and what isn' t , so i can' t always be frank about harmless things , although i was frank with alexei today .
you' il say i' m being tortuous again .
i' m listening .
how can i put it more plainly ?
i' m sworn to secrecy .
on some specific subjects , i don' t speak so i can' t lie .
but on others , where i' m not so tied , i can' t help telling little fibs .
to other people , i don' t mind .
but to you , i always want and always try to be completely honest .
april why close it ?
let the spring air in !
not now .
i' m cold .
you' ve got your cardigan .
i think i' ve picked up a fever .
i' il take my temperature .
i think you' ve lost weight .
as always , in spring .
more than usual .
you should see the doctor .
i can' t see much wrong with you but ... still , that fever worries me .
you should take some precautions .
what precautions ?
what did the doctor say ?
i' m better , but still fragile and prone to infection .
we must watch you .
did he give you a tonic ?
he says ideally we' d live in the country .
somewhere sunny near paris would do .
the suburbs ?
they' re either lower class and grim or expensive .
come to think of it , boris has an empty house in maisons laffitte .
he wants to do it up but hasn' t the time or maybe the money .
you think it' s habitable ?
for us ?
maybe , yes .
hello , darling !
good journey ?
fine .
nice conservatory !
a bit decrepit .
the glass won' t fall out !
please , come in .
there are some leaks , hence the basins .
but they' re only a few drops .
a place to paint ...
bedrooms are upstairs .
the shutters are closed .
we' il go up later .
here' s the kitchen .
the gas and running water just need turning on .
so ?
do you like it ?
it' s too beautiful !
it' s unreal .
a fairy tale .
but i' m not sure we can accept .
do you like it ?
like it ?
of course , but ... no buts .
accept or we' il be upset .
you can stay for two years , three if you like .
i have plans to turn the place into a horse stud , but not right away .
so , we move out of paris .
the rent we pay now will go to you , but it' s paltry .
so paltry that you needn' t bother .
i' d feel embarrassed otherwise .
don' t .
you' re doing me a favour .
your being here is worth more to me than rent .
never leave a house empty , right ?
you' re well set up !
i love how you' ve arranged the furniture .
don' t you feel cut off and bored ?
people will visit us .
not everyone has a car like me .
the train station is nearby .
besides , i' m completely wrapped up in my painting .
very pretty !
i' ve found lots of pretty places in the country around here .
fyodor !
that' s him to a t .
you see , i don' t miss other people except a few good friends like you , but fedya' s away too much these days .
he was seen in berlin .
when ?
some time ago .
november .
i don' t see ... you' re sure it was berlin ?
my brother in law lgor saw him .
he lives there .
yes , but did he speak to him ?
he saw him through a cafe window .
it wasn' t him .
he was talking to someone in the street and stopped outside the cafe .
igor recognized him .
maybe not .
fedya took a trip in november , but it was to brussels .
he even sent me a card !
brussels is on the way to berlin .
i' m sorry .
i talk too much .
i' ve upset you .
look , lgor could have been wrong .
fedya' s entitled to go to berlin without telling me .
he' s discreet about his work and that' s fine .
he has to keep things quiet .
i' d rather not know .
well , he was doing nothing unusual .
that pleads in his favour .
in his favour ?
what do you mean ?
i didn' t want to say it , but you should be prepared for certain rumours .
what rumours ?
some say he' s a communist sympathizer .
it' s only a rumour .
absurd !
he sees reds to get information .
i know you' re right .
but white russian circles are so prone to spy fever !
when fyodor' s seen entering a ministry in berlin ... what ministry ?
some official building with an endless german name .
but you know , it could actually help to dispel the rumours .
especially as some officers were angry that he didn' t go to salamanca .
i know , but only to avoid offending the french government , which barely tolerates us .
i understand , but although boris is in industry now , he still sees old comrades who can' t hold their tongues .
they say dobrinsky' s retiring soon and fyodor is tipped to succeed him .
there' s bound to be jealousy .
june arsinoe , have you seen my bag ?
there it is .
i' m going to belgium for a few days .
like in november ?
yes , to brussels .
and then ?
then i' il come home .
via berlin ?
who said that ?
maguy , the other day .
what a gossip !
who told her ?
only dobrinsky and i knew .
her brother in law saw you .
true , he lives in berlin .
he could' ve said hello .
you were with someone .
then you went into a ministry .
which one ?
she doesn' t know .
is that all ?
you look upset .
it was a top secret job !
too secret to tell your little wife ?
let alone others !
they already know .
not the wrong people , i hope .
i' il get boris to make his wife pipe down !
if it' s not too late .
this time , don' t say i' m not confiding in you .
i' il explain .
no , don' t if it' s a secret .
i won' t tell you everything .
the association needs money .
our treasury' s half gone .
some german firms helped us but now all money movements are subject to nazi state approval .
i was seeking it when i was seen , regrettably .
we mustn' t appear to be close to the nazis .
that' s rich !
rich ?
i think not .
the left' s in power here .
maguy told me something else .
you' re a suspected communist spy .
now it' s my turn to laugh .
call me a double agent , even a triple one !
everything i do is to support white army veterans .
it' s not easy work .
having to act friendly with both sides takes cunning .
i' m a soldier .
i learned cunning in the field .
i play it like a chess game , where you have to hide your moves .
it' s less noble than soldiering but not subservient .
i' m not a lackey like a taxi driver , salesman or clerk .
i don' t strut on the world stage but i' m well placed behind the scenes .
i get a better view into the hearts of governments than journalists whose job it is .
like them , or even more so , i don' t just observe .
i act .
indirectly , but the information i exchange with people who directly influence events can be decisive .
you think i' m delirious ?
i' m not , but the thought of having all this ... power yes , my power , makes my head spin .
i have much more responsibility than dear general dobrinsky imagines .
i have to take decisions affecting the balance of power in europe and even the world !
you think i' m exaggerating ?
hardly .
listen to this .
the other day , while conversing ... politely with a top official from a nearby country , i instinctively evaded a seemingly harmless question , sensing that my reply was of vital interest to his government .
what interest , i don' t know , but i felt i was being manoeuvred and i balked , at the risk of endangering my mission .
i' il stop .
i' ve never seen you so elated .
talk , if it relieves you .
will you forgive me ?
i was only half listening .
i prefer not to know too much .
i know your work is dangerous .
i fear for you , but ... i prefer not to think about it .
you could be in danger too , if you knew too much .
who' d know that i knew ?
it would get around .
someone could ask you an innocent question .
you' d answer in all innocence , but unwittingly give away some less innocent detail .
who would be asking me ?
anyone .
your communist friends , for instance .
they' re not spies !
not as such , but they could pass the word to less naive listeners .
i shan' t tell them about berlin .
i should hope not !
or that you stayed away from franco .
you can .
everybody knows .
and i' il carry on seeing them .
i want to ask jeanine to lunch on thursday .
on the train , i read an interview with maurice thorez .
we love france .
we staunchly support peace and concord .
given the events in spain , we reject
the prospect of two blocs implacably opposed to each other .
the communist party initiated the popular front
to combine the forces of the proletariat and the middle classes .
see ?
it' s clear .
it' s the fascists who want war and strife , not us .
don' t you agree ?
yes , i believe you .
does your husband ?
he thinks ... well , i don' t know .
we don' t talk politics much .
he doesn' t seem to believe in the red peril .
because he thinks stalin no longer wants to export the revolution , and the french communists obey his every word .
nonsense !
that' s right wing talk .
in a blindfolded world , stalin sees clearly and so do we .
we believe the revolution can wait .
the priority now is to combat fascism and we need everyone' s help .
you look distracted .
do you really disagree ?
sorry .
i was listening , but ... your words reminded me of something irrelevant .
go on , i' m listening .
i' m interested .
andre' s overjoyed .
picasso has decorated the spanish pavilion at the world' s fair with a big mural showing the german bombing of a spanish village .
he' s thrilled to see a great modern artist committing himself to the fight against fascism .
the world' s fair paris expo ' 37 gathers speed .
the german pavilion is inaugurated by dr schacht , the development minister .
i hope this exhibition , with germany' s participation , will help to strengthen the ties between our peoples .
the ussr pavilion is inaugurated by mr hirschfeld , the soviet charge d' affaires , attended by mr dormoy , interior minister , mr zay , education minister , and mr chautemps , minister of state .
the spanish pavilion displays a work by the cubist artist , pablo picasso , inspired by the bombing of guernica .
moscow , june 12th .
tukhachevsky and seven generals to be executed tonight you knew marshal tukhachevsky well .
we were army cadets together but the revolution parted us .
he joined the enemy .
still , i respect him .
he' s very upright , almost too uncompromising .
you think the charges were all trumped up ?
of course .
such a man would never consort with the nazis .
quite the opposite .
he wasn' t eliminated just for personal reasons .
i knew him as a so called hawk , eager to attack hitler before he rebuilt the german army .
so stalin' s a dove ?
just now , yes .
i doubt he' il start the hostilities .
are you sure ?
positive .
he doesn' t feel strong enough yet .
so why are the french communists so violently against pacifists such as emery and bergery ?
because the views from paris and moscow are different .
stalin doesn' t want war but he' d happily push others into it .
he' il help the west if the west goes first but i' il bet my boots he won' t start it himself .
so why' s he sending volunteers and aircraft to spain ?
first , because the fascists and nazis went in first .
but second , for the italians , germans and soviets , spain isn' t so much a battlefield as a training ground where you size up your opponent and you don' t care who wins .
i' d even say these interventions are a sham , designed to hoodwink western opinion .
hoodwink ?
why ?
to hide what he' s up to .
which is ?
that , i wish i knew !
bravo !
you got me .
in fact , you know no more than i .
i do .
i' m telling the naked truth .
you complicate things at will .
i hope you like this .
i' m sure you' il love it .
what' s it called ?
exactly .
aren' t you hungry ?
not very .
i think i should see the doctor again .
he' il say nothing new .
i think your condition needs specialist care .
i' il make inquiries .
i don' t really trust french doctors .
france is way behind in medicine .
you' re not suggesting we go to america ?
no , another country .
can' t you guess ?
not germany ?
no , russia .
the ussr , if you prefer .
russian medicine is even ahead of the usa .
my son told me .
he' s studying it there .
even so , how would i get to russia ?
why would they take me ?
i' il go with you .
they' d accept us even less .
what is this wild idea ?
not so wild .
politics have changed .
not for you .
stalin' s executing all the generals .
dead men need replacing .
i don' t like your joking , especially about that .
i' m not joking .
would you want me to ?
i' m deadly serious .
then you' re crazy .
everybody is , starting with the soviets .
that' s why they' il accept me .
i' ve been told about it .
told what ?
specific things that will soon be more specific .
but even if they accept you , you won' t accept them .
if there' s war , you won' t change sides .
yes , i will .
if there' s war , i' m bound to be on france' s side , which russia will join , as it can' t stay neutral .
you don' t think i' d fight for mr hitler , do you ?
i don' t like the germans .
i' ve never relied on them .
unlike dobrinsky , who expects them to help us .
they don' t give a damn about us .
they like us as little as the soviets fear us , which is not a jot .
at a pinch , they' d have given us some sorely needed funding if we' d agreed to do them some menial favours in the spying department at its vilest level , but we refused , at least i refused .
you remember i went to berlin to see the german spymaster , heydrich ?
what did i refuse to tell him ?
things about my classmate tukhachevsky , whom i' d met secretly in paris on his way to the king of england' s funeral .
of course he wasn' t candid but his guarded remarks led me to a few conclusions .
the gestapo must have heard we met , since heydrich casually probed me about it .
i answered evasively , he bestowed a look of ice on me , and we left it at that .
we won' t be seeing those funds in a hurry !
but why did mr heydrich want such information ?
presumably , the germans were keen to compromise the red army chief , knowing stalin was down on him .
but i' m only guessing .
i disliked the man' s arrogance .
i don' t like nazis .
i don' t like their grubby , grasping vulgarity .
if i have to choose sides , i won' t choose the huns for anything .
i' m a russian first .
if i have to fight abroad , i' il serve only my country .
what is it , arsinushka ?
are you crying ?
i' m not crying .
you' ve no idea how happy i am .
i was so scared you were a nazi .
that was my worst fear !
have your red friends converted you ?
i love you !
if i had to choose , i wouldn' t hesitate either .
they haven' t converted me .
but i' ve realized from living next to them that they' re well meaning people who sincerely want peace .
sincere , i agree , but gullible .
aren' t you ?
aren' t you gullible too ?
isn' t it all too good to be true ?
maybe i' m gullible too , but ... i' il risk it .
in all modesty , i think i' ve always had a flair , a skill for sniffing out and separating true from false .
here' s what i' ve been offered , and i think it' s perfectly plausible .
i' ve been offered ... and not by some low ranking operative ... i have every reason to believe it comes from high authority , indeed the highest of all .
you' re smiling ?
you don' t have to believe me .
never mind .
what is this offer ?
to be reinstated in the army with my rank of general , no less !
you see ?
my remark about the purges wasn' t a tasteless joke .
the red army is short of experienced officers .
with none left in russia , they have to look elsewhere .
they' re inviting me to run an army staff college .
if it' s true , it' s wonderful .
the only thing that could stop me accepting is ... yes ?
yes , it' s you .
i' m still dazed .
let me think .
i' m not against the offer , if it' s genuine .
i hope to have proof of it soon .
but also , life in russia will upset your habits .
i haven' t got any .
my habits are you .
as long as i' m with you ...
life won' t be too bad .
we' il be better off than we were in paris .
wealthier , anyway .
under the soviets , it' s shocking but true , there are privileged people , which will include us .
i' il have a big salary and a decent sized house on the black sea , where the climate' s as mild as the riviera .
sound good ?
i don' t know .
giving ourselves trussed and tied to the soviets is very risky .
it scares me .
but can' t you see the risks in france ?
the real risk to your health and others , more nebulous but very possible ?
i' m a fly in the ointment .
i' m at risk ... from soviets , nazis , all kinds of fascists and soon , i' m afraid above all , the french government .
i could be arrested , kidnapped like kutyepov , assassinated at any time .
quite frankly , i' d feel rather safer in russia .
poor tukhachevsky , rest his soul , got what he deserved .
he tried to thwart his boss and came unstuck .
it' s natural .
i' il simply be an executive , serving my motherland against external threats .
bomb blasts in paris the employers federation building on rue de presbourg was partially wrecked by a time bomb .
a few hundred metres away , on rue boissiere , a similar device exploded almost simultaneously at the allied metal industries hq .
two police officers died in the blasts .
i think i can wear this on sunday evening .
it' s perfect .
and for wednesday' s cocktail party ?
i' ve got nothing .
have one made .
no time .
yes !
order it on saturday , it' il be ready for wednesday .
we' d have to spend four days in paris .
would you mind ?
i have shopping to do and people to see .
who' d plant those bombs except the communists ?
rightist provocation ?
too far fetched .
maurras says it' s the government , smearing the fascists and its communist pals in one go .
too duplicitous !
it' s too machiavellian .
i don' t like blum but i can' t see him doing a thing like that .
what do you think , general ?
nothing .
i' m neither a policeman nor a prophet .
but let me say that journalists tend to put their own ideas before the facts , which often belie them .
i' m a journalist .
i know .
with candide .
jean rochereau .
pleased to meet you .
these facts .
where and how can they be found ?
do you have a hunch ?
none .
i' m just curious .
off the record .
i know , but as i said , i don' t read the stars or coffee grounds .
my wife and i are delighted to join the party .
it hurts !
it doesn' t look swollen .
does it hurt when i press ?
it' s deeper .
a shooting pain .
you may have pinched a nerve .
i' il get you an aspirin .
a good night' s sleep will do it .
my dress isn' t ready ?
you said late morning .
two o' clock , then .
two o' clock is too late !
i have important phone calls to make after lunch .
let' s eat now , then i' il drop you off and you can wait .
i' m sorry we' re early , but ... i was in the area .
my wife has a painful foot and can' t walk far alone .
we' il wait .
it will take a good hour .
no matter .
i' il make my phone calls from the local post office and be back in an hour , or rather ...
a good hour .
see you later .
so , is the dress ready ?
i' m still waiting .
it' s ready for fitting .
ravishing .
i' il keep it on , then .
we' il remove the threads .
the hat goes well .
how about some shoes ?
i like these .
they' re getting worn .
my foot still hurts .
i' d rather not change now .
at the hotel , you' il have time to rest .
the cocktail party' s at 5 but i want to be there early , as i' m representing our division .
the other generals are all abroad .
won' t dobrinsky be there ?
no , i doubt it .
he' s got a very busy day today .
the officers from brussels are here .
i' m touched .
you came specially from brussels .
we' re honoured .
may we pay our respects to general dobrinsky ?
i' m afraid he may not be able to come and even if he does , it won' t be before 8 .
that' s a pity .
we have to catch the train .
but he lives nearby .
we can call on his wife .
coming to call on mme dobrinsky ?
will it take long ?
we' il just look in .
the men from brussels have a train to catch .
then i' d rather stay here .
i hope i wasn' t gone too long .
ready to go home ?
yes , if you don' t mind .
i' il come too .
my aide will see to the remaining guests .
what' s up ?
i think i' ve got myself into a mess .
when ?
this afternoon .
but we were together .
what could you have done ?
i shouldn' t be telling you , but ... i' m afraid you might be questioned unprepared .
questioned about what ?
how we spent the day .
i know very well how we spent it .
it' s ages since i had a whole day out with you .
it was a marvellous day .
i don' t want anything to spoil it .
unfortunately ... what is it ?
i' m afraid dobrinsky' s disappeared .
what do you mean ?
plain disappeared .
i don' t know where he is .
wasn' t he at home ?
no , but he was out late , anyway .
so ?
i' m afraid he' s been kidnapped .
who told you ?
how do you know ?
we didn' t see him all day .
while i was at the dressmaker ... did you meet him ?
where ?
near here .
didn' t he come ?
did he come ?
he was kidnapped from under your eyes ?
like kutyepov ?
exactly .
he got in a car which sped off .
you let it go ?
i wasn' t going to chase it !
but you let him get in ?
you , wary and shrewd as you are ?
who was in the car ?
two germans .
i thought you fell out with them .
they were fake germans .
so they were russians ?
soviets ?
your new masters !
and poor general dobrinsky , who trusted you , fell in the trap .
me too .
i was fooled !
do you swear ?
i swear .
on your son' s life ?
leave him out .
i refuse to swear on an innocent person .
listen !
why , if you' re innocent ?
on principle .
and i' m not completely innocent .
i was careless .
i' il explain .
don' t bother .
it' s between you and your conscience .
i' m not your confessor .
but i' il tell you this .
you say you broke off with the nazis but i' m not accepting any favours from the bolsheviks who mounted such a dirty trick .
i refuse to buy that favour with the life of the leader you ignobly betrayed !
i' d rather die here ... and watch my lungs and bones rot ...
than be cured there , at that price , if i could .
i can believe you were fooled , for all your cleverness .
i can understand but not forgive it , if you betrayed him for me .
as i said , that' s between you and your conscience .
but i refuse , at any price , to profit from these crimes .
don' t expect me to set foot in russia now , ever !
our dream' s dead , anyway .
i have no illusions .
i' il explain .
don' t bother .
tell me one thing .
while you waited for your dress , did anyone enter the room ?
no , from the moment you left until you returned .
except the seamstress , who came through to fetch something or other .
but she didn' t look .
i won' t say you went out .
is that the idea ?
but what ?
i don' t fully understand .
you left , saying you' d be back at once .
not at once .
you had an hour to wait .
an hour' s not long .
it' s ample .
i' il explain .
dobrinsky had to meet a man covertly to pick up an envelope .
he wanted me to accompany him .
as you' d be at the dressmaker' s , i suggested ranelagh gardens , halfway between there and the dobrinskys ' .
you didn' t have to come with me .
i' d promised .
the rendezvous was set yesterday .
for such important business , i' d have understood ... it wasn' t meant to be important .
i didn' t mind .
no , it suited you .
it gave you a good alibi .
why should i have needed one ?
believe me !
let me explain !
explain .
i won' t say another word .
i took the metro .
we met at la muette station .
we walked to the gardens in barely five minutes .
on rue d' andigne , we found our contact waiting in a comfortable chauffeur driven panhard .
the german said the man with the envelope had moved the rendezvous to the bois de boulogne , three minutes ' drive away .
i couldn' t show any suspicion or the deal would be off .
besides , dobrinsky had no hesitation in trusting this polite german with his aristocratic elegance , and got into the front seat .
i reached for the back door handle .
it was locked .
the german said " wait , i' il open it from inside .
by now , the driver had the engine running , but that was normal .
the german walks round the car and gets in at the back , slamming the far door shut .
as he pretends to lean over to open the near door , the car roars off down the empty street .
who had the envelope ?
didn' t i tell you ?
the agent of a right wing anti nazi german industrialist was to leave it on a bench .
we' d arrive , he' d stand up , we' d take it and go .
all done in what , five minutes ?
ten at the most .
add it up .
the metro there and back , 30 40 minutes .
the walk to the gardens , say 12 minutes plus 10 to collect the envelope , makes ... 40 plus 12 , 52 , plus 10 , 62 .
just over an hour at the most .
and the fake german ?
where did he come from ?
strictly speaking , he wasn' t a fake .
he was ... col .
werner von nussdorf , a former military attache at the embassy , disgraced for political reasons .
he can' t possibly be working for the nazis .
and what would they gain from it ?
what would the russians gain ?
i can' t see that either .
that' s why i wasn' t suspicious .
do another kutyepov ?
too idiotic !
it' s like chess .
the stupidest moves are the hardest to beat .
anyone can lose to a beginner .
like me , remember ?
but they' re not beginners .
what threat could poor dobrinsky pose ?
then maybe it wasn' t a kidnapping .
dobrinsky wanted you out of his way and gave you the slip .
it' s not his style .
it was the soviets .
but why , for god' s sake ?
it makes no sense .
parade him in russia , saying he retired to the soviet paradise ?
he' d never say it , even under torture .
replace him with a lookalike ?
create a fake general , photograph and film him ?
easy !
we russians have good actors .
summon the press , hey presto !
and you laugh .
because it' s grotesque !
as grotesque as the kidnapping itself .
do you think i' d lend myself to such a farrago ?
it' s so gross , i never imagined it possible .
any faint doubts i may have had on the way , i quickly dismissed .
i wasn' t particularly wary .
no more wary than usual .
well , a tiny bit more .
i admit i made an unforgivable mistake .
i thought " whatever will be , will be .
i should never say that .
dobrinsky' s been irritating me with his pro german sympathies , among other things .
i often think to myself , with shame , but still ...
to hell with him .
let him fall sick .
let him die , so we can finally be rid of him .
they' re disgraceful thoughts but only thoughts .
i suppose everyone has them .
except you maybe , saint that you are .
don' t you believe it .
i sometimes have thoughts that ... i had one today , coming out of the metro with dobrinsky .
crossing the street , he was almost run over .
i held him back but the thought flashed through my mind ,
that was close .
almost good riddance !
are you appalled ?
i understand you .
that' s not the point .
but there is no point .
i can' t see any point in kidnapping dobrinsky .
my megalomania isn' t all in the mind .
i was much more dangerous than him .
is it me they want to compromise ?
i know things they wish i didn' t .
who do i mean by " they " ?
call me paranoid , but it' s no underling .
it' s someone very high up .
the more i consider it , the more i think this lunatic stunt must be the work of the cleverest , most highly placed , far sighted people .
it' s no minor affair .
it' s part of soviet global strategy and probably nazi , too .
we can' t see the wood for the trees .
you mean hitler and stalin ... it' s insane !
why ?
what for ?
your mind' s been twisted by consorting with spies and plotters .
europe' s two strongest leaders are old hands at plots and very twisted ones !
who is it ?
tchernov .
one moment .
piotr pavlovitch , what' s going on ?
sorry to bother you .
gen. dobrinsky' s disappeared .
disappeared ?
what do you mean ?
he didn' t come home .
his wife called galinin , who' s waiting for you at the office .
no need for your car .
i have a taxi .
very well .
i' il get dressed .
wait for me in the taxi .
are they suspicious ?
no , but ... i' m his deputy .
they' d naturally tell me first .
we' re sorry to get you up in the dead of night , but do you know where general dobrinsky is ?
i' ve no idea .
i gather his wife is looking for him .
he told me he' d be very busy today .
when did he tell you that ?
yesterday .
you haven' t seen him today ?
not today .
i haven' t been to the office .
nevertheless , didn' t you arrange to meet him outside ?
at one o' clock ?
at one , i was with my wife at her dressmaker' s .
i repeat , did you arrange to meet him at 1 : 00 at la muette metro station ?
what makes you think that ?
this !
dobrinsky left this note on his desk .
today at one p . m .
i have an appointment with voronin
at la muette station .
we are to meet a german officer named werner ,
attached to the german embassy .
this meeting " was voronin' s idea .
it may conceivably be a trap .
i am leaving this note , just in case .
do you recognize his handwriting ?
i think it' s a forgery .
and there' s a spelling mistake here .
see ?
it can' t be dobrinsky .
it' s clearly a forgery .
forgery or not , it will have to be shown to the police .
i agree .
i' il come with you .
vladimir petrovitch , please .
what is it ?
you saw how he flinched when you said one o' clock ?
keep a close eye on him .
he may be less cocky towards the police .
we' il see .
where' s voronin ?
he just left .
waiting downstairs , presumably .
presumably ?
idiot !
why is there no light ?
strange .
it was working just now .
let' s use our lighters .
i' il go first .
he' s not anywhere on the street .
he could be as far as the champs elysees !
see ?
i was suspicious for good reason !
if you hadn' t kept me back we' d have caught him !
perhaps he' s gone back to the hotel .
i' il get a taxi .
fedya ?
is that you ?
captain tchernov .
one moment , please .
fyodor alexandrovitch ?
is he back ?
we' re looking for him .
he went with you .
yes , to the office , but then he disappeared .
he wasn' t on the stairs or the street .
so you suspect him .
otherwise he wouldn' t have fled .
be careful .
he could shoot himself !
but he' s done nothing !
we were together all day .
even at 1 p . m . ?
i was at my dressmaker' s .
we' il check .
it' s the truth !
the seamstress said fyodor didn' t stay in the waiting room . ... but he wasn' t there .
he went out and came back a full hour later . ... a full hour later .
i even heard him come in .
i can testify to it .
no trace of voronin or dobrinsky was ever found .
arsinoe muddled up her alibis .
a czech passport in the couple' s name was found in their house .
defendant , rise .
charged with complicity despite flimsy evidence , she received a heavy prison sentence . ... guilty of complicity in the kidnapping of general dobrinsky .
in prison , her bone tuberculosis grew worse .
on september 9th 1940 her left foot was amputated and she died a month later .
the startling news of a pact between nazi germany and soviet russia leaves the democracies stunned and appalled at the signatories ' duplicity .
war
defeat
evacuation
come in , please .
good morning , general .
we have arrested mr semenov , your landlord , for black marketeering .
in our search , we also discovered that he was spying for the soviets .
we found these two plans , of your offices and his apartment below .
see these marks ?
they show the location of ... the microphones .
leutnant , stop working for a moment .
will you follow me downstairs ?
you too , commissaire .
leutnant !
can you hear me ?
yes .
say a few words to your men .
yes sir !
can you hear ?
semenov confessed .
every word spoken upstairs was reported to the soviet embassy at least until the war , when our man switched to black marketeering .
his big mistake !
that explains it all .
remember the voronin case ?
the spy who kidnapped gen .
dobrinsky ?
you think he hid here ?
most probably .
semenov was listening in and let him in to hide .
or voronin knocked on his door .
possibly .
let' s check something .
come here .
see ?
it cuts off the electricity in the stairs .
i see .
the lights were out when we came down to hinder our pursuit .
i' d never have suspected mr semenov .
he was very discreet .
in his business , they usually are .
when we went to report to the police , he must have run to the soviet embassy for refuge .
and from then on ... from then on , it' s a big mystery but i have my pet theory .
the soviets took him to marseilles and shipped him with a group of international brigades to barcelona .
there , he was held in the ogpu detention centre where andreas nin , the anti stalin communist , was murdered .
voronin must have met the same fate .
liquidated .
a blown agent , he was no more use to anyone .
unless he was taken to moscow and killed there .
or simply in the embassy cellars .
whatever , it' s a sad story .
such a brilliant man .
dead or alive , i feel sorry for him and sorrier still for his charming wife , arsinoe .
she was jailed in all innocence , i believe .
is she still in prison ?
no , she died .
