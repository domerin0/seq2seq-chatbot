slugs
six , six , six .
six , six , six , six ...
that counts .
johann , i' ve been thinking .
where you work ... they spend tons on pr , right ?
so let' s do a commercial for the post .
it' s not called post anymore , now it' s called telekom .
wrong , the post is ... still in charge of mail & phone calls .
who still calls from the post ?
the commercial is done , but we say ... we' re a creative young team ... with a great idea .
give us an office for 3 months ... with internet and everything else , and we' il design ... a revolutionary new ad concept .
if you' re not happy , pay nothing .
sure , they do it all the time .
they' re not risking a thing .
that' s 3 months of ... surfing , games , and free phone calls .
plus they' il want our commercial too .
' cause it' s brilliant .
rats .
wanna know how it goes ?
i rolled a six .
black background .
3 seconds long .
coming from left ... midway down the screen , you see in yellow the word " post , " and right afterwards ... the same word again , and again ,
post , " " post , " " post " ...
the text runs from left to right ... across the screen .
and you hear a male voice , sonorous but young , saying , " post , post , post " ...
blows your mind , doesn' t it ?
it' il be the start of a whole new craze .
on the streets people will wink at each other and say : " post , post , post .
you could at least mention it to your pr manager .
sure thing .
i' il talk to him first thing tomorrow .
yeah , i mean , it doesn' t hurt to ask .
it' s a terrific idea .
yeah , but you said you' d talk to the pr manager .
y' know , about the commercial .
yeah .
post , post , post , yeah .
it' il work for sure .
yeah .
post , post , post ...
i imagine how you look still half asleep ... as you drink your coffee at the breakfast table .
how you bend forward and reach for the butter , and your bathrobe slips .
i imagine my hand between your legs , how nice and warm it is here ... in your little nest .
has anyone ever written back ?
leave me alone , i' ve got a headache .
wildbach .
funny .
gerhard married a girl from there .
oh yeah ?
he was my best friend in grade school .
we sat next to each other for 4 years .
julia loibnegger .
bet she' s dying to move in with you guys .
ok , put it back now .
we are but tiny stars born of a cosmic bang .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
here , look .
it was singing so pretty just now .
i got a few 100 grams sausage .
i need you to come pick it up , make cold cuts ...
answer the phone .
hi .
it' s 60 for the house sausage .
i' m out of caramel , but i' m getting some fresh raider next week .
i' il let you know next time .
and i' m not the bank , ok ?
you know how much you owe me ?
you' il get your money , don' t worry .
seppi ?
are you jerking off ?
don' t call me seppi .
you do know that that' s not the answer .
i don' t care .
what are you thinking about ?
could it be ... that you wrote another letter ?
what ?
i imagine you in the morning ... as you drink your coffee .
thanks a lot .
i lost it .
you really turn me on the way you butter your roll .
hello .
hello .
do you take credit cards ?
you want a receipt too ?
very funny .
come in .
forget it .
smart girl .
a true professional , i like that .
honey , i' il be right back .
i don' t need any dope at the moment , turns your brain to mush .
but i hear you' re ... interested in films and whatnot , and that you know that scene .
where' d you hear that ?
not important .
i might have something for you .
a video , see ?
fuck off .
with boy and girl students .
with sex and whatnot .
amateurish is ok , like a home movie , just let the camera run .
i' d be the producer .
what did you have in mind ?
well like with intellectuals , you know , who get together and say smart stuff ... and screw each other .
but nothing lame .
with blow jobs ... and bare asses and juicy stuff like that .
that' s what folks wanna see .
forget it .
let' s have your 100 .
is that ganja ?
normally i' m the ganja man .
i can' t believe you don' t know a couple of guys ... who just think about porkin ' all day .
hey , isn' t that martha over there ?
didn' t you make out with her at mao' s party ?
yeah , a little .
who' s that geeky teaching major behind her ?
beats me .
old becomes new .
now that can' t be .
new becomes old , marie .
warm becomes cold .
and now should cyberspace replace your dear grandson ?
a keyboard wet with tears of woe .
where did all the people go ?
go on , she' s just playing hard to get .
i could sure use some pussy again .
i' ve been thinking the same thing .
we don' t get the kind of regular sex we deserve .
i don' t know .
why does some geeky 30 year old think i' m sexy ... and not the 20 year old babe ?
teaching major chick would have gone to bed with you .
i' m not that hard up .
i was a teaching major too for a while , but the way she was dancing ...
yeah , no way .
i mean , so wild and uninhibited , but at the same time totally uncool .
we' ve got more important things on our minds .
like how to make sure that in our next life ... we don' t get reborn as ourselves .
you wanna split a kebab ?
business is going good ?
it' s ok .
how' s it going with you two ?
i play soccer every once in a while ...
i' ve seriously been thinking ... about quitting my job at the post office .
changing shifts so much ... makes my head spin in the afternoon .
so what' s your plan ?
i' d like to do something creative .
dance instructor maybe , huh ?
lambada classes for swinger couples .
there' s an untapped market .
or we could make a porn flick with you as stars .
very funny .
that' d be something creative .
it' s what you men always dream about .
you can count me out .
did someone buy box wine ?
mr. cheapskate strikes again .
i think we should have a good story ... with credible characters and real emotions and entanglements .
and what i like are the mix ups .
you know like someone slams the door of a hotel room ... and the nine turns into a six .
i don' t know .
we' re making a sex film not a jerry lewis comedy .
i think the intellectual side has to ...
it' s gotta be realistic , y' know ,
like in the george michael video at the ski lodge ... where they have a blast and everyone screws everyone .
except for with us it' s summertime .
i think the best stories are like real life .
students go to the countryside to study for an exam ... hoping it' il improve their concentration , and then ... everyone fucks everyone .
in between they drill each other and quote aristotle and stuff .
where' s the story ?
they flunk the test .
oh , real life , just more intense ...
and more stimulating : " friction fiction .
we may call it fiction , but that doesn' t mean we can' t really do it in the film ... just so the people watching can lean back and say ,
it' s just a movie .
like the gorgeous female character ... who appears in the male character' s ... fantasy sex scene ... that turns out to be just his dream .
but she really was naked in the movie .
and in reality too .
during the dream sequence shoot .
i think we should cheetah some alcohol .
what ?
i think we should cheetah some alcohol .
i see , meaning what ?
i' d like to cheetah a little alcohol tonight .
it doesn' t mean anything .
it does so .
then where does this come from , to cheetah alcohol ?
obviously from cheetah .
the animal ?
akin to leoparding .
i don' t know , i think she' s lion to us .
you' re using it as a verb .
that' s crap .
it really does exist .
i swear .
she' s leopardizing our friendship .
that' s a verb .
there you have it .
of course .
i assume this works with every animal .
i mean why not giraffe a pint or camel a six pack ?
or we could apple or orange ourselves silly .
you get 3000 up front , i' il throw in some ganja , that' il take care of expenses .
you get the rest when you deliver .
how do i do a whole porn flick on 3000 ?
that' s just for starters .
look , if things work out ... and it sells well ,
i' il give you a cut .
you let me down , though , you got a problem .
there' s some milk left ...
roger .
and thanks .
have a safe trip .
the bike isn' t too sturdy , i' d rather ...
let' s go , reini .
first vienna wet pussy raffle .
hey , an orgy where you wear paper bags with faces drawn on them .
incredible .
you want this one too ?
who are we balling anyway ?
we' il be casting the female roles .
and i' il be directing , as non playing captain .
now i get it .
you wanna play director .
directrice .
max , leave the dildos alone .
c' mon we' re outta here .
ciao .
bye .
see you later .
max , let' s go .
listen to this dialogue .
mashed potatoes still good ?
mao is absolutely right .
if these idiots can earn money like this , so can we .
look , what' s so hard about that ?
and you don' t care if mao' s making all the decisions ?
the main thing is to get the job done and collect .
and mao' s the right person for that .
with my share of the money i' m going to mallorca .
i' il learn how to kite surf and get drunk every night .
and when i come home , i' m gonna start a new life .
say what you want about porn flicks , but they kick ass when it comes to names .
see , gina wild , for instance .
teresa orlowski , that' s hot , man .
shouldn' t we be thinking of male names ?
oh brother .
i mean , for example , clit eastwood ...
he sounds like a hermaphrodite .
what about boris pecker ?
he' s got enough problems .
but the beat all of names is ...
phil mydick .
he' s for real .
it comes from feel my dick .
you get it ?
i know what you mean , but seriously , what about joe meat ?
joe because my name' s johann ...
i like joe meathead better .
give us a call and stop by .
politeness . " ok .
check moaning skills .
suitability .
i' m not sure about that one .
what ?
that' s a key point , you dork .
we have to see if they really want to do it .
alright ok .
if you want , we can scratch " politeness " ... and replace it with " cleanliness .
hey , it' s important to me .
and how did you want to monitor that ?
yes ?
sabi .
what ?
sabine .
and this is johann , my partner , or joe .
i thought i' d try anyway .
can' t you read , we' re only casting women .
do i have a chance ?
my parents are so fuckin ' stingy , it drives me crazy .
i don' t know how i' il get through the summer .
be in our film .
i' il cancel your debts and you can earn some spending money .
shit , i should be studying for my entrance exam .
it' s your call .
well , mara .
what makes you think you' re right for this job ?
i just know it .
is this really so important ?
i had group sex on my high school graduation trip .
no problem .
i' m very generously endowed .
it' s her .
i know .
it' s her , i' m positive .
should we go over our lines ?
what ?
were we supposed to learn them ?
the scene where i drill you .
i' m at the kitchen table holding the philosophy book .
watch the road .
wow look !
it' s an old pub turned into a whorehouse .
stop , i think i need a drink .
nothin ' doin ' .
that feels so good .
sometimes i need to work up a sweat .
sitting at the desk all day makes my muscles and bones ache .
then we cut to the stationary bicycle , right ?
gimme that letter .
i imagine how you look ... still half asleep ... ... drink your coffee .
... butter , and your bathrobe slips .
i imagine my hand between your legs , how nice and warm it is in your little nest .
what does that mean little nest ?
we are but tiny stars born of a cosmic bang .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
this crap turns you on ?
turn right .
are you kidding , it' s on the left .
no , the right .
i ought to know where my parents live .
drive carefully .
people have died on this road .
calm down , there' s nothing wrong with the way i' m driving .
there it is .
there .
i' m allergic to schnbrunn yellow .
yuck , all over my car ...
roll down your windows .
i don' t believe this .
why didn' t you say something .
gross .
turn off the windshield wipers , fat lot a good they' re doing .
hold on , mara .
i' il deal with it later .
are you still nauseous ?
you know how much this call is costing ...
hi , can you hear me ?
hi sweetheart .
when did you get there ?
the weather' s lousy , tomorrow should to be nicer .
it' s already clearing up a bit .
remember to lock the door to papa' s room .
you know how he is .
and also ...
i have to tend to things , ok ?
motorized windows .
they' re worthless , always broken .
where' d you get this place ?
reini' s been working on it for years .
where' s the tv ?
locked up .
that' s off limits .
this door stays shut .
shit .
they' re only slugs .
garden slugs .
yuck , you guys are so gross .
this is so disgusting .
they' re all over the whole lawn .
how can i act here ?
i' m not lying down ... until it' s cleaned up , is that clear ?
it' s not a lawn it' s a yard ...
get a bucket and collect the slugs .
normally you pour beer on them , huh ?
what a waste though .
or you use ducks .
just the indian runner ducks that go upright .
they can' t fly , huh ?
yeah , selective breeding .
now all they do is eat slugs .
up to 150 a day .
i' d like my own room .
tough luck .
i don' t bite .
you think they' re a delicacy ?
if there' s this many , they can' t be a delicacy .
a delicacy is uncommon & special .
in that case i' m a delicacy too .
per day we need at least an indoor ... and an outdoor fuck or oral sex scene , plus one lesbian scene , and we' il be done by saturday .
i' m marika , an exchange student from serbia .
i' m so unexperienced in studying ,
i can' t wait to bone up with the boys .
whether from the front or the back ...
i read every book from cover to cover .
was that ok ?
i study law .
this is my 18th semester .
i' ve invited a few friends to my house .
we' il be studying for a mighty tough exam .
i wonder ... how this twitching in my testicles ... will affect my studying .
my name is joe .
i study philosophy and this is my 12th semester .
our young study mates ... are eager to learn ... and simply dying to start cramming with us .
i' m sure we' il be delving deeply ... into some very stimulating subjects .
i' ve been thinking about our parts .
and the sports student ...
the sports student still isn' t clear to me .
i can' t relate to her .
what do you mean ?
well , to me she' s this introverted character ...
for being introverted she sure goes all out in aerobics .
it suits you though .
that' s totally irrelevant here , ok ?
my character gives head too , but if you suck dick the way you drive , you' re gonna make everybody puke .
is this girl mental or something ?
let' s talk about this like adults .
i bet she' s never given a real blow job .
my god , she' s so crude .
i wish i' d known this before .
in the next couple of days you have the chance to earn 2000 each .
i think that' s reason enough to get along .
who wants some more goulash ?
i bet condoms look lame on film .
are you crazy ?
you can catch something so easily doing porn .
they said they' re clean .
they' re young .
i believe them .
really ?
hi mara .
graduation trip .
group sex .
herpes , syphilis , alds .
you' re insane .
chancroid .
gonorrhea .
who do you like better ?
martha or mara ?
that' s something professional porn stars never ask themselves .
you just take things as they come .
this feels so good .
sometimes i need to work up a sweat .
sitting at the desk all day makes my muscles and bones ache .
sitting at the desk all day makes my muscles and bones ache .
our bones are aching too .
i' il show you a workout that will really pump you up .
i' m burning to start , on fire like an olympic torch .
well maybe after all this studying we should have a little fun .
what do you think , marika ?
what kind of car is this , georgie ?
a corvette .
it' s not just a corvette , it' s a philosophy .
i' m a philosopher myself .
and you wouldn' t want to lose it ?
harry , i need this car .
in my business , image is everything .
i can' t drive a micra mouse .
you don' t pay , you don' t drive anything .
harry , i give you my word of honor : in 2 weeks you' il get the rest of your money , or i' il return the car myself .
you knew the conditions .
your corvette is history .
you can' t do that .
cause and effect .
it' s like the flap of a butterfly' s wing .
what' s with the flap of a butterfly' s wing ?
can honor produce an effect ?
listen .
i am listening .
tell me what your concept is .
i' ve got something killer in the works .
nothing half baked .
it' s tight .
tight ?
yeah , it' il work out .
whatever .
i need a partner .
i can feel it in my bones .
i' m talking wampum .
what' s in your bones ?
y' know , loot .
moolah .
dough .
silver .
a treasure trove .
let me swallow your torch .
don' t look at the camera .
and besides that' s my line , and it goes ...
let me swallow your fire .
can we get on with it ?
no , i can' t work if she doesn' t know her lines .
redo the lines afterwards .
no , we' re not post dubbing this .
smarty pants .
i have to agree with mara .
john doe from smalltown ... won' t go into a porn shop ... asking for titfuck parade instead of ...
thirsty ladies in negligs for the soundtrack .
is that an erection ?
hi george .
no , you' re not disturbing , we' re doing a shoot .
what ?
3 days ?
that wasn' t the plan .
unexpected complications .
whatever .
you' re not cutting corners , are you ?
don' t worry , it' s under control .
it' s choppy , too many holes in the dialogue .
bad timing .
i gotta go .
it' s not that hard .
max says " torch , " you strip , and he fucks your big dialogue hole shut .
i' m not fucking next to you , you slut .
is she whacked ?
get off there , you brats .
i' il blow you away .
i' il blow a hole in your heads ... so the blood shoots out the front and the back .
all day and not a single scene we can use .
too stupid to fuck .
then do it yourself , if you' re so smart .
i don' t need porn to fuck .
or friends either .
i can do it myself .
she doesn' t need friends ?
c' mon , mao , hansi , stop being silly .
don' t call me hansi .
see ,
i told you it was a harebrained plan from the start .
shut the fuck up , you spoiled bitch .
hey max .
great party .
now she' s really snapped , the retard .
are you crazy ?
say that one more time , say it .
say it again .
retard , retard ...
stupid bitch .
if it' s embarrassing or you don' t want to do it , then we' il stop , ok ?
i promise .
i have the feeling i' m about to get my period .
then you don' t have to fuck .
it' s like in gym class at school .
let me just go fix my makeup , ok ?
way to go .
excellent .
fantastic .
keep it up .
fuckin ' ay , man .
great closeup .
good , martha .
you' re both doing great .
do you know this one ?
i know a magic trick .
the woman says , " alright , let' s see .
the man says , " it' s easy .
get down on your knees and suck my dick ,
and afterwards vanish into thin air .
i am so thirsty .
get her a drink and then we' il get started .
great job .
bring the chocolate too .
i' ve got one too .
a princess comes up to a pond , sees a little frog , and thinks ,
how cute . " so she says ,
if i give you a kiss ,
will you turn into a prince ?
frog says ,
no , that' s my brother , me you gotta give head .
this round' s on the house .
cheers .
it won' t make us blind , will it ?
it' s only good if it burns .
how do you make a woman scream twice ?
first you fuck her in the ass ... then you wipe your dick on her curtains .
that was a good one .
totally stupid .
let' s get back to work , ok ?
martha blow job .
i feel sick .
i need to lie down on the sofa .
what' s wrong ?
you stoners , see what happens ?
she' s snoring .
sound asleep .
let' s carry her inside .
i told you to go easy on the hash .
are you kidding .
this is the alcohol .
hash doesn' t get you sick ' cause it makes you eat .
mao is a strange name .
my real name' s maria .
but reini thought that ... as a baby i looked like mao tse tung , and it stuck .
what do we do with her now ?
we fuck on the sofa .
anita , come down , this is wild .
no reini , please .
you come upstairs .
it' s so far out .
here' s to a wonderful vacation .
cheers .
same to you .
does mao have a boyfriend ?
there' s probably someone .
i hope it' s not one of those two turkeys .
definitely not .
i think she prefers women .
nonsense .
she' s never brought a boyfriend home .
me either .
crappy music .
we should have brought our own .
i think it rocks .
my old man and his records .
what' s wrong ?
don' t you like your dad ?
he fights the system from the inside out .
subversive to the core .
and we allegedly ruined his revolution .
he has a fit if mom talks on the phone too long .
where did they go for vacation anyway ?
a communist castle .
run down , but cool .
and no tv .
his way of punishing himself ... for earning too much and building this place .
you' re not serious .
sweetie .
i love you .
i have a hard time fucking just anyone .
i don' t mean that as an excuse because ... the girls are really sweet ...
but with you and me , we' re already a team .
or how should i put it ?
you and me , we could be something magical .
you know ?
i mean , it' s already there .
i like you a lot , really , but i' m going to sleep now .
can i spend the night here anyway ?
max , please .
we were pretty drunk .
your normal graduation trip .
and do you do this ...
i mean , have you done this a lot ?
shit , i should use a condom .
it' s too tight .
you have to wait till you' re hard .
yeah , i know that , but it' s not easy with you on top ...
then i' il be on the bottom .
did you know we made out once ?
of course .
well ?
well what ?
yeah well , didn' t it mean anything to you ?
i don' t know , i guess it was ok .
i mean i was pretty drunk .
and now ?
actually , i' m pretty drunk now too .
hey ...
what ?
i' m not sure if we' re on camera .
don' t worry .
we' re fine .
it' s close enough .
you can' t see us .
sure you can .
it' s fine .
i want to stop .
stop .
stop .
stop .
stop , you asshole .
hey , mara , i' m sorry .
it' s been 2 years since i had a girlfriend ... and half a year since i had sex .
please forgive me .
you know what ?
we' il erase it , ok ?
i' m really sorry .
shit .
i don' t believe it .
the bitch .
i should have known .
maybe she just went to the next farmhouse .
to get milk .
should we go look for her ?
it' s a 3/ 4 hour walk at least to the next town .
and she stole my makeup case too .
what ?
what a lousy , rotten thing to do .
can you lend me your kajal ?
mara , i' m sorry about last night , honest .
i just wanted ...
it still happened , didn' t it ?
want some ?
about last night ...
i dunno ...
it' s ok , but now let me think .
you gotta help me .
or this won' t work .
please .
see if i care .
we' ve got a deadline , and we still haven' t filmed anything remotely usable .
much less a closeup or a cum shot .
we haven' t filmed absolutely nothing .
what did we film ?
the lesbian scene won' t be a problem anymore .
why not ?
i' il be back in an hour .
where are you going ?
what' s going on ?
c' mon george , pick up the phone .
look a butterfly .
i don' t see anything .
there , a butterfly .
a butterfly has 12, 000 eyes .
you know , butterfly comes from flutterby , so it means to flutter by ... and not a fly that likes butter .
life insurance is another funny word , or earwig .
i mean , it doesn' t come from ear or wig .
this might sound silly now , but ...
i liked you from the first time i saw you during casting .
i thought it would pass , but it didn' t .
funny .
we' ve slept with each other , but this is the first time we' re really talking .
good morning .
is the boss around ?
no thanks , we' ve got enough girls .
no , it' s not that .
we need a girl .
miss , we' re not open yet .
sometimes i write letters ... with no return address , to women .
and i image them opening them ... and reading , and their jaws dropping , not literally , of course .
it' s kind of like hide and seek , except they can' t find me .
i' ve never told anybody that .
not even max .
once some guy called me for three weeks ... every single day ... and babbled nonsense .
he didn' t tell me his name either .
mostly he didn' t say anything .
and besides , how should i put it ?
what do you mean by we ?
we need ?
all of us .
all of you .
or someone else ... who needs something , if you know what i mean .
we want to borrow a girl for a movie ...
we might not get her back .
i' ve got money .
so do i. good day .
bye .
george , can you help us find a new girl ?
what ?
what' s wrong ?
martha ran away .
the specific identity of their renegade cunts ... doesn' t mean beans to me .
the exact names of your bitches ... don' t mean a fart to me .
what ?
you aren' t making sense .
listen , by saturday i need the video ... with what you' ve filmed so far .
do they understand ?
i' m afraid that' s not possible .
or they won' t get a cent .
or you won' t get your dough .
it can' t be that hard .
others have gotten the job done .
i agree , it can' t be that hard .
end of discussion .
julia ,
i imagine you reaching across the counter ... and handing the no .
2 wrench to me on the ladder , still sweaty after tearing the plastic packaging ... off our new wall to wall bookshelf .
and then i imagine your skirt slipping open ... and i ... work your hot nest with my plane iron until sparks fly .
you can read it yourself .
hello , mrs. schreiber .
good morning , mrs. loibnegger .
then you are from our village ?
you wrote me the letter .
loibnegger , julia .
oh .
how funny .
i always imagined you completely different .
i' m just passing through .
breakfast in my bathrobe .
the warm nest .
yeah , yeah , i know .
why do you do this ?
i didn' t know it was you ?
it was a coincidence .
no reason .
it' s always the same letter .
but i don' t know that .
i thought the letter was for me .
that' s mean .
really mean .
it wasn' t anything personal .
look at me .
i' m not disappointed .
i just pictured you different .
i always compared you to gerhard , and i just thought ... you were somehow special , that' s all .
sorry .
you need more confidence , it was a nice letter .
really nice .
you' re so beautiful .
i love you .
you' re my wife .
we are but tiny stars born of a cosmic bang .
a cosmic bang .
what' s going on here ?
he' s really getting into it .
that' s the best you can come up with ?
i think this is cool .
yeah well .
at least he' s putting up a fight .
other people just know how to talk big .
oh .
and yourself ?
you just know how to spread bad vibes , right captain ?
get changed .
wait .
i' m about to come .
you look great .
what are you thinking about ?
c' mon , don' t make it more complicated than it is .
i' ve imagined sleeping with you so many times ... but somehow ...
then think about something that turns you on .
what are you thinking about ?
a phat slimy frog .
can you two try not saying anything ?
you' re a little too heavy .
ok , turn on the camera .
give it to me .
do you feel me ?
i feel you , this is so sexy .
just do it .
i can' t .
have you ever noticed ... that all your names begin with " m " ?
martha started with " m " too .
really weird , huh ?
hey , what' s the big idea ?
how does it feel ?
it sucks .
georgi , what' s all this ?
tickets .
you' ve speeded through every radar in town .
i' ve got a fast car .
how would it look if i drove like a dead snail ?
are you really as stupid as you look ?
the corvette is mine .
you' re 10 installments behind , tickets out your ears .
i bet you don' t even drive anywhere .
oh yeah , well that' s a dirty lie .
where do you drive when you' re out driving ?
places , y' know .
appointments .
yesterday i bought me this jacket .
with fringe .
killer , huh ?
jacqueline says i look like a young johnny winter .
that' s not the problem , georgi .
you' re a sweetie , but you gotta learn to manage your money .
last chance : drive to the house ... where they' re shooting and get that treasure trove .
you' re the producer , think of your image .
you can do it .
sometimes , georgi , sometimes everything works out in the end .
hello .
i behaved like a total jerk , and i swear i didn' t want to ruin everything .
i' m really sorry that we lost a whole day because of me ...
really .
do you have my kajal ?
and now what ?
i dunno , we have to try a different approach , totally different .
i think i know how .
is anybody scared to do this ?
yeah , me .
ok , but why if we all want it ?
i' m not completely sure , inside .
then why are you here ?
well ...
not because of the sex .
then what ?
because of the money .
it' s for the money , so ... if we fuck , we get money ; if not , nothing .
so you' re saying , we have to think differently ... and say , " money equals fucking , " is that it ?
if money equals fucking , then we just fuck .
no more thinking .
we do it and get paid .
we have to get out of this thinking mode ... and into the action mode instead .
that' s what i think .
i don' t see what the problem is .
you' re making things more complicated than they are .
it' s so strange , if you say it' s no problem for you ,
i can totally see doing it with you .
i mean doing this with you .
because it' s like ... you' re scared the other person might have a problem with it ... and you become the problem yourself .
take dogs , for instance , with them it happens twice a year : in the spring and in the fall it' s mating season .
the dog knows he' s got a job to do and that' s that .
and that' s why it' s so hard to shoot doggie porn , they' re only horny twice a year .
on the contrary , doggie porn would be easier ... because you know come spring , come fall , when it' s time to do it , they can do it .
i think it makes a difference ... if you' re an animal or a human being .
humans think about their drives constantly and animals don' t .
i wish i could turn off my brain for once and just go all out .
you mean with a woman ?
if one person is having fun , if he' s totally into it and he completely lets go , the whole group starts to believe in it too .
an awesome feeling .
and that can be ... so intense you forget everything .
look , what are we fighting against here ?
we all want it more or less , right ?
yeah .
well , yeah .
yes .
yes we do .
we just have to get rid of the " more or less , " right ?
in other words , our problem is that we' re humans ... and not primitive animals and we' re uptight about fucking .
what we yearn for is a state ... where we don' t care .
back to a ... primordial herd fuck state , the sexual primal soup .
look , if we could just forget everything , and regress to a primitive animalistic ... throbbing mass of bodies ...
i' m not filming .
why are you doing this , huh ?
why are you fucking him ?
do you need it ?
i thought you liked women .
what' s your problem ?
everyone just slept with everyone .
but that was for the movie .
i thought that was something special .
you want me to film you ?
this is what we all yearn for , the primal state where nothing matters .
and nothing matters .
you said so yourself .
stop it , max , get lost .
shut up , i' m not talking to you .
ok , then fuck .
i' il get it on film and we' il sell it .
we won' t get rich , but we had fun .
go on , go ahead and fuck .
fuck .
what don' t you understand ?
that we' re fucking without you ?
that we didn' t ask your permission ?
what' s wrong ?
move in with us so you can cook for him .
stop it , ok .
we can go shopping again like a family .
stop it , you idiot .
johann doesn' t really mean anything to me .
oh yeah ?
and if he did , would that be so bad ?
i' m in love with you .
come on , you don' t believe that yourself .
seeing you two was too much for me ...
you were too much for me .
i fished it out .
come back you little chicken shit .
shit .
i can' t understand you .
this can' t be happening .
don' t scream at me .
that son of a bitch .
you' re not getting anything from me .
who' s she talking to ?
listen , we' ve got a minor crisis ...
don' t tell me to listen , you listen to me ,
i' ve had it up to here with your crisises .
i' m coming by to look at the tapes .
calm down , george .
calm down .
i' m the producer and i want a screening .
it' s bad timing .
bad timing ?
you know what i' m doing with your bad timing ?
look .
you see this ?
is he dangerous ?
i have no idea .
i' il blow your bad timing out your ears .
beaver ranch

this can' t be happening .
from da front ...

what am i gonna tell harry ?
what am i gonna tell harry ?
sorry about the movie .
what movie ?
and about mara too .
yeah , alright already .
hey mao ,
i realized something else .
oh yeah ?
there really are cheetahs .
i saw it too .
what does mao do for a living anyway ?
' cause she' s spending a few days vacation at home .
she just said they wanted to relax ... and then study for an exam .
hope we don' t disturb their study session .
don' t worry , i get along with young people .
johann , i was thinking ...
max , back off , ok .
for once just leave me alone .
i don' t care how many cheetahs you guys see .
ok , it' s all the same to me .
it' s just too bad we blew our chance .
yeah , no kite surfing in mallorca ...
no , i mean the movie itself .
lots of people have made porn flicks , but there are lots more who haven' t .
did you want to show it to your grandchildren ?
see what a stud grandpa was ?
but look , that' s not grandma .
no , i' m serious , max .
you and i are two vain peacocks coming home empty handed .
when the peacock spreads its tail , the asshole comes out .
once an asshole , always an asshole .
the porn industry reflects our neoliberal ...
do you two mind shutting up for once ?
just until we get home , ok ?
don' t you understand ?
it was a ' 68 corvette ... with more extras than you can imagine .
you' d never see them on a factory model .
tires out to here , spoiler , a heated driver' s seat ...
let' s go .
my kidneys get cold really easily , y' know ?
and ... double shock absorbers .
and i tell you it purred ...
like a keith richards solo .
then it was high time .
what do you mean by that ?
c' mon , get in .
it' s not funny .
some things you don' t joke about , ok ?
but johann , i' m totally convinced ...
i don' t care how many pigs you see .
i told you guys to shut up .
no way .
hey , what about me ?
six .
yes .
six .
no way .
the 6 is gone .
we could take a train .
you got money ?
no .
six .
me either .
we could hitchhike .
it' s your turn .
six , six , six ...
no .
nobody' s ever stopped to give me ride .
screw you .
i' il explain it once more , ok ?
nice and slow .
i always say , " don' t think small , think tall .
you gotta think big .
small investments don' t pay off .
you' re always the idiot .
are you saying i' m an idiot ?
no , i mean in general , you' re always an idiot if you think small .
so you did call me an idiot ?
no , you' re not listening .
you' re right , i am an idiot .
you' re not an idiot .
yes sir , i' m a complete idiot .
you' re not a complete idiot , ok ?
a regular idiot .
not a regular idiot , you' re not an idiot at all .
what an idiot .
good morning .
are you folks done ?
i' m george , i' m the producer .
good morning , pusterhofer .
morning .
i own the beaver ranch .
meet glory and bessie ...
say hello .
last night while i was walking i had a great idea .
key word : alternative healing .
no matter what , people are always going to be sick .
sick people are the biggest target group .
and those are precisely the people ... my commercial is aimed at .
live long and prosper .
did someone just stop ?
no idea .
all is quiet in tense anticipation .
a huge audience stares up at an empty balcony .
out comes spock .
he gazes out at a crowd of earthlings ... in the middle of the 21 st century .
chi gong and prosper .
the crowd cheers and applauds wildly .
i mean , it' s absolutely brilliant .
or think : retro .
play pong and prosper .
give bong and prosper .
it' s brilliant , isn' t it ?
