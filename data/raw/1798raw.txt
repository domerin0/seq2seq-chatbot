gregorio .
gregorio !
they' re all dead !
oh , god , they' re all dead !
massacred !
the alamo has fallen !
they' re dead , all of them !
they' re all dead at the alamo !
did you hear what he said ?
the alamo !
take the oath for militia duty , and you will receive 640 acres ... 640 acres of your own ... of your own choosing .
640 acres of your own choosing .
that' s better .
smooth .
if it doesn' t burn going down , how can you be sure it' s bad for you ?
i' il be interested to see you gentlemen when you arrive in texas and have your first taste of mescal .
is it true that men and women imbathe together out in the open ?
cleanliness is next to godliness .
yes , well ... excuse us .
invest now , gentlemen , or lament later .
i' m a screamer .
i got the roughest racehorse , the prettiest sister , the surest rifle and the ugliest dog in the district .
my old man could lick anybody in tennessee , and i could lick my old man .
i can outgrin a panther and ride on a lightnin ' bolt , tote a steamboat on my back and whip my weight in wildcats .
whip my weight in wildcats .
whip my weight in wildcats .
whip ...
what is it ?
he' s here .
who' s here ?
he is here !
five minutes !
i' il tell you , these old bones could sure use a respite .
' course , the good citizens of tennessee may grant me that wish come next election .
no !
excuse me one moment .
yes .
yes , of course .
sam houston .
makin ' friends wherever you go .
to tennessee .
oh , to hell with tennessee .
to texas .
it' s sad , isn' t it ?
a year ago , we' d be looking at two men with their caps set for the white house .
now ...
what you peddlin ' , sam ?
somethin ' a certain congressman might need before long .
are you sellin ' rockin ' chairs ?
i' m sellin ' texas .
andwhatwould iwantwithnortemexico ?
david , you remember what tennessee was ?
you come to texas .
timber , water , game , cattle , more land than you can possibly imagine .
you take the oath for militia duty , you will receive 640 acres of your own choosing .
my own choosing ?
mm hmm .
sam !
you figure this new republic' s gonna need a president ?
before we begin tonight' s performance ,
i should like to acknowledge the presence of the man whose life inspired our humble play .
good evening , mr. crockett .
good evening , mr. crockett .
you want to call me an opportunist ?
hell , yes , call me an opportunist .
but taking the alamo changed everything .
we' re in control now .
yes !
we swore allegiance to mexico under the federalist constitution of 1824 .
santa anna tore that document up personally , did he not ?
named himself supreme dictator ?
well , i , for one , ain' t swearin ' allegiance to no son of a bitch dictator .
yeah !
neither am l .
time to go , general .
they are talking crazy .
drunk back sober .
it' s a miracle of the first order .
seguin , why' d they put me in charge of the army if they won' t listen to me ?
we need to muster and train troops here , not send soldiers all over texas .
idiots .
they think santa anna' s just gonna hand over part of mexico without a fight ?
they are gonna want you humble , general .
i humble myself before god , and there the list ends .
to march an expedition between here and matamoros
is lunacy !
you do not split an army into vagabond militias that march off on the slightest pretext like bloodthirsty rabble .
do you really believe this war is over ?
you opposed bexar , but victory was ours !
yeah !
and now you oppose matamoros , where victory will be as sweet .
no .
perhaps , sir , you simply oppose fighting .
fighters shall lead the new country of texas , sir .
the council will now consider the removal of general houston from command of the regular army .
all in favor , show of hands .
aye !
the late , great sam houston , former governor of tennessee and now former general of the texian army .
scottish catamite .
what did you say ?
i called you a scottish catamite , grant .
one step down from associate pederast .
all right .
remain clothed !
come for me !
come !
come !
any excuse to start removin ' your clothes , is that right , houston ?
this is not your concern , mr. bowie .
indeed .
this is between me and the scottish catamite .
wanna borrow mine , grant ?
' cause i' il surely give it to ya .
buy you a drink ?
i didn' t know you drank .
you marked the coat as single breasted , with a four inch stand collar ?
as you desired , mr. travis .
lieutenant colonel .
and the epaulets are gold bullion ?
should be quite a sight .
where would you like the uniform sent ?
san antonio de bexar .
i' il be there defending the alamo .
defend against what ?
the mexican army left there with their tail between their legs .
mr. william ... she here .
in your office , waitin ' .
your wife .
mr. bowie !
colonel .
buck .
drunken hottentot .
two bit dandy .
well , the choices are abandonment , adultery , or cruel and barbarous treatment .
i think abandonment' s most accurate .
any of the choices would be appropriate .
you sure you want to do this ?
well , we we signed the papers .
i meant charlie .
i don' t intend this harshly , but he should have a male example in his life .
i' ve already made arrangements for him to stay with a fine family while i' m away .
well , we have a long way to travel .
your father' s becoming a rich man , and he' il be able to see to your education .
you' re makin ' a jackass outta yourself , sam .
vindictive sons of bitches .
texas ... wasted on the texians .
they' il come back .
the mexicans .
a well trained army , against all this handful of amateurs .
only chance we have is to fight ' em out in the open .
forts , they' re useless , useless to us .
what is it about that damn place , anyway ?
what place ?
the alamo .
every time a sour wind blows through , everybody runs there and hides inside .
ain' tnothin ' butmud .
acaved inchurch .
andcannon .
cannon .
protects my home , sam .
you don' t have no home , any more than i have .
it' s a damn shame about your wife , jim .
am i still your general ?
you know you are .
i want you to return to the alamo , fetch the cannon back .
will you do that for me ?
will you promise that you' il do that for me ?
yeah .
now , you mind mr. and mrs. ayers .
don' t go causing any fuss .
when i return , we' il get a home of our own .
i promise .
one crowded hour of glorious life is worth an age without a name .
jim bowie' s here !
know which one he is ?
right there .
welcome to san antonio , bowie !
welcome home , jim .
welcome home , mr. bowie .
welcome home , jim .
you all right , mr. james ?
i have a home .
sir ?
we know you guys from somewhere ?
whoo , that one' s pretty dandy , that one .
halt !
have the quartermaster secure billeting .
yes , sir .
where you going , sir ?
i' d like to see what i' m fightin ' for .
dismount !
it was founded as a mission 100 years ago .
the bexarenos called it the alamo , after alamo de parras , a spanish cavalry unit that moved in 30 years ago .
as you can see , it is not designed with military intentions .
she' s well armed .
most cannon of any fort west of the mississippi .
i placed our largest , the 1 8 pounder , on the southwest corner , so it fronts the town .
the north wall is in ruins , so i have two batteries with five cannon to defend it .
what was the original convento is now barracks and a makeshift infirmary .
major jameson , our engineer , is emplacing a palisade between the main gate and the church .
what was here before ?
nothing .
an indefensible flank .
it still appears indefensible .
good riflemen and a 12 pounder should hold it .
the church itselfwasn' t built till 1 756 .
it has no roof .
was it destroyed in battle ?
the catholics never quite finished it .
saints dominic and francis .
francis had two gifts : prophecy , and the ability to inspire passionate devotion .
this fort is the only thing that stands between santa anna' s army and our settlements .
as goes the alamo ...
so goes texas .
if the need arises , i recommend you take my personal quarters on the west wall .
they' re isolated , yet near the primary defenses .
i' m afraid i don' t understand , sir .
i have personal matters to attend to in mina .
i' m leaving you in command .
i know you fought this posting , travis .
forting up is not exactly a cavalryman' s dream .
i' il defend it with my life , sir .
your biggest task will be keeping the volunteers and the regulars from killin ' one another out of boredom .
the mexican army would have to cover 300 miles in the dead of winter to get here before i return .
i got one guy around my neck , i got another guy takin ' off half my ear
with his one good tooth .
the two that i knocked out are now wakin ' up , realizin ' who knocked ' em out .
but i' m fine .
i' m fine .
' cause i know i got my trusty , loyal ward right next to me .
so i turn over my shoulder , and who do i find ?
tortilla lady and her 1 3 year old hound dog .
where were ya ?
i hate to tell you this , jim , but you were in the wrong .
exactly .
that' s when i need you the most .
oh , god .
i love this place .
i love it , too .
colonel ?
you look terrible , almost yellow right around the cheeks and forehead .
you a doctor now , along with everything else ?
i' ve heard rumor that you plan to destroy the mission and remove the cannon .
where' d you hear that ?
men tend to prattle on when they drink .
your men tend to drink .
it would be a great mistake .
i agree .
and any further discussion on this will be between myself and colonel neill .
colonel neill left bexar this morning on personal business .
it' s my command now .
well , my , my , my .
that is a swift rise , billy .
might as well break out those long britches .
your men exhibit no discipline .
if matters don' t change , it will become my duty , as colonel of this post ...
lieutenant colonel .
restrain your men ... or i will .
? habla ingles . muchachos ?
we got ' em , david .
it appears to me that we' re all on the same side here .
what you doin ' out here ?
my name is david crockett .
crockett of tennessee ?
davy crockett ?
he prefers " david .
now , there was this little detail of a re election back home .
aww !
it' s all right .
it' s all right .
' cause you know what i told them folks ?
what' d you tell ' em ?
i said , " you all can go to hell .
" i' m goin ' to texas !
yeah !
welcome to texas , davy .
thank you , sir .
put your mark on it , mr. crockett ?
look out .
let me through here .
absolutely .
i' m half alligator , half snappin ' turtle .
i can slide off a rainbow and jump the mississippi in a single leap .
tell ' em , davy , how you can whup your weight in wildcats .
i seen you onstage .
well , that wasn' t me .
why ...
why , sure it was .
no , sir , that was just an actor in a play .
he was performin ' a character .
aw , come on , davy .
say the lines .
davy crockett , the lion of the west .
i dare san tanna to show his face now you' re here .
well , i understood the fightin ' was over .
ain' tit ?
! alto !
! fuego !
well done .
you don' t have the sand to even talk to two of my men , much less arrest them .
i told you i intended to restore order .
you' ve got no command over my volunteers .
none .
i have absolute command .
break ' em out , boys .
yeah .
' cause it' s gonna be a cold day in hell anybody takes orders from a debtor who leaves his pregnant wife in the middle of the night .
how about a land swindler who marries a girl , god rest her soul , for her father' s money ?
whoa , whoa , fellers !
hey , hey , hey , fellers , now , listen .
just ' cause we ain' t got nobody to fight don' t mean we need to fight one another .
congressman crockett has a point .
we should do this democratically .
a vote .
what about colonel crockett leadin ' us ?
no , i' m with you fellers , not above you .
all for the lieutenant colonel , raise your hand .
now , come on , men .
no repercussions .
all infavorofmecommanding .
andallforme ?
all right .
you can command the militia only .
regulars can' t be led by a volunteer .
it' s illegal .
you don' t like the outcome , you change the rule ?
is that it , buck ?
aw , don' t fret about it , jim .
we all know who' s in charge .
you know , i don' t know why we had to tent up outside of town when there are so many fine houses with big corn husk beds just sittin ' empty .
why are they empty ?
apparently some of the folks hereabouts seem to think the mexicans is comin ' back .
most of the boys think they wouldn' t be here till late spring if they come at all .
figure they know something we don' t ?
mijito . cierre la puerta y ven para aca .
tell me what is going on !
we' il never be able to defend the town .
orderly withdrawal into the alamo .
greys fall in !
close up !
shoulder arms !
forward !
forward !
orderly withdrawal !
please proceed to the alamo in an orderly manner .
don' t run .
you' re fine .
almeron !
one , two , one , two .
almeronl susanna !
let' s go , men !
come on !
follow me !
come on !
colonel ?
i' m sorry to disturb you , but we got quite a mare' s nest out here .
i have to get couriers out while there' s still time .
you and your men will defend the palisade .
the palisade ?
you talkin ' about that little old bunch of sticks over there ?
you prefer a different assignment ?
no , that' s the one
i was gonna put in for .
if you could oversee manning the walls , it would be a help .
we should have six men to a cannon , 18 tubes , which works out to ...
108 men .
and we should have a man with a musket every four feet of wall .
we' re gonna need more men .
! viva santa anna !! viva mexico !
to gonzales , and to colonel fannin at goliad .
godspeed .
sir .
colonel , you should see this .
we' re gonna need a lot more men .
what is colonel bowie doing on the bridge ?
tryin ' to talk us out of the spot we' re in .
fire the 1 8 pounder .
sir ?
you heard me .
fire the cannon .
prime the gun .
fire !
lo siento .
manuel .
i had nothing to do with this .
you out of your mind ?
i' m trying to get us a truce !
a truce ?
if we broker a cessation , we will do so from a position of strength , not weakness .
goddamn !
we don' t turn belly up and beg .
otherwise , we have said nothing , and this conflict means nothing .
dyin' for nothin ' means shit to me .
their response ?
shit !
david .
surrender at discretion ...
buck .
perhaps , colonel , they' il only execute the officers .
i think we all just got promoted .
looky here .
within a few days all of texas will know our situation .
tell me , buck , in alabama , precisely how many is " a few " ?
no .
excelencia .
ah .
crockett ?
si .
alteza . ! excelente !
you know , personally , david ,
i' d just as soon take my chances fightin ' out in the open .
hell , i don' t like being hemmed in any more than you do , but here we sit .
avoid cluster at all times .
keep your eyes set for crossfire .
pack plenty of grease wrap balls , put ' em in your blocks .
you may be a firin ' fast , but not yet .
load all your muskets and stack ' em , but don' t powder ' em .
ten minutes in this , they' il be nothin ' but sticks , understand ?
oh ...
and nomoreofthis , byanybody .
go to it , boys .
here we go , sir .
come on , let me help you .
that' s right .
take it in .
it burns .
but , sir ...
that' s it .
i smell like a skunk' s ass .
jim , what ails you , exactly ?
consumption .
typhoid .
pneumonia .
one or all .
exactly .
she' s a dandy , all right .
that knife fight you got into , sand bar over in natchez ...
it was the one that got you written up .
that all true ?
you believe everything you read now ?
i didn' t read it , i heard it .
and the way i heard it , he put a sword cane and two shots in you .
i don' t remember .
figure ol ' sam will be down here pretty soon .
when he gets here , we' il have a good ol ' time .
itwas three shots .
sword came through my lung and went through my hand , and then i cut his heart out .
those ain' t bears out there .
do you understand that ...
davy ?
why in the hell do you suppose they don' t just attack us ?
i seen vaqueros spend all day long just killin ' one bull .
you bring a band , you' re countin ' on havin ' something to celebrate .
mighty nice of ' em to serenade us like this .
it' s a cavalry march , but i' m told santa anna fancies it for other uses .
he borrowed it from the spaniards , the spaniards from the moors .
it' s called " deguello . " kinda pretty .
deguello means " slit throat .
now , ain' t that pretty .
get down !
get down !
! fuego !
! fuego !! fuego !
fire !
watch the north wall !
! fuego !! fuego !
keep your heads down , boys ! ! fuego !
! fuego !
! fuego ! ! fuego !
mornin ' .
mornin ' .
yes , sir .
lieutenant , check the main gate for me .
i need a head count for jim bowie .
yes , sir .
notice how you can' t really hear it until it stops ?
until they decide to attack , i suspect we' il be bombarded on a nightly basis .
deprive us of sleep .
they want you to start seeing ghosts everywhere .
colonel , i became a little heated with you in front of your men .
it was ill advised and not terribly professional .
don' t worry about it .
most of my men didn' t even understand the words you were usin ' .
it' s important that you and i agree .
for me , though we are poorly supplied , surrender is not an option .
i submit that we engage and delay until reinforcements arrive .
sometimes , it' s just the way you say things , travis , that' s all .
i swear to god .
bring it down !
down !
down !
down !
down !
down !
down !
to the left .
to the left .
in .
do you notice anything different about them cannon ?
they moved ' em closer last night .
this will be the spot .
as our well is dryin ' , anytime you find yourselves not busy with other matters ,
i need you to be diggin ' a new one here .
ain' t bad enough we got to fetch ' em the water .
now we got to find it for ' em , too .
david , you said you wanted to see him .
there he is , the napoleon of the west .
which one ?
that' s santa anna ?
yeah .
he' s quite the peacock , isn' t he ?
wind kicked up .
! infanteria !
saquen sus canones .
! fuego !
go back !
take cover !
take that ball to captain dickinson .
we can reuse it .
you' il be pickin ' that up yourself .
well , i' il be .
cut it to shot and send it back to ' em .
yes , sir .
fire the cannon .
fire !
fire once from each cannon !
you heard the colonel .
lieutenant colonel , colonel .
you heard the man .
let' s give ' em a taste !
let' s give ' em hell !
come on , get up here !
andfire !
fire !
fire !
fire !
at this very moment our soldiers are held in the alamo against a force of thousands .
they put their hopes in colonel fannin . who . despite his pedigree . has proven himself ill equipped to lead . much less march . an army .
this is from colonel travis .
i call on you in the name of liberty to come to our aid with all dispatch .
lf this call is neglected ,
i am determined to sustain myself as long as possible and die like a soldier , who never forgets what is due to his own honor and that of his country : victory or death .
gentlemen ...
i will raise an army .
we will relieve the alamo .
but only after we have declared independence and created a government that can be legally recognized by all the nations of the world .
that ... is what every besieged man in the alamo is fighting for .
we have no idea if any of our couriers made it out .
you know the land and the language .
you are asking me to leave my men .
i' m asking you to deliver a message to houston and return with a response .
i' m ordering it .
don' t give him too much water .
he' s just like me .
he drinks too much , he ain' t worth a damn .
i' il bring him back to you , santiago .
you bring yourself back .
captain ... go with god .
makes a man ponder the possibilities , don' t it ?
what happened to your cap ?
crawl away ?
no .
i only wear it when it' s extra cold .
the truth is ,
i only started wearing that thing ... because of that feller in that play they did about me .
people expect things .
ain' titso
can i ask you something ?
all right .
now , which was tougher , jumping the mississippi or riding that lightning bolt ?
can you catch a cannonball ?
if it was just me , simple old david from tennessee ,
i might drop over that wall some night and take my chances .
but that davy crockett feller , they' re all watchin ' him .
he' s been on these walls every day of his life .
he' s burning with fever .
try to get him to drink something not whiskey .
sam , get me some sheets and cold mud .
i have issued orders for colonel fannin to retreat from goliad .
john forbes is mustering more men throughout south texas and bringing them to gonzales .
i expect 1 500 men to be there when i arrive .
we will march out , circumventing santa anna' s army , and relieve the alamo from the west , withdrawing back to the colorado and establishing on a line southeast from beason' s crossing to brazoria .
you will have command of the regular army .
the militias will have their own command .
no .
i will command all or none .
you do your calling , and i shall do mine .
i will lead an army .
you will birth a nation .
gentlemen , to texas !
to texas !
here they come !
here they come !
position the cannon !
muster !
move back !
move back !
they' re measuring our strength .
prepare yourselves .
fire at will , gentlemen !
captain dickinson !
aiml fire
run , you rabbits , run !
them jacales out there offer pretty good cover .
i wouldn' t mind stretching my legs .
burn ' em down .
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
get that first one , right there .
aghl
arrghl
what' s your name , boy ?
oh , yeah , davy .
thatta boy !
fine shootin ' , boy .
muy bien .
muy bien .
muy bien .
watch the north wall !
over there .
what are they working at ?
when they come over those walls ,
i want you to throw up your hands and holler ,
soy negro .
no disparo .
what' s that ?
mexican law said there ain' t no slaves , right ?
yeah .
and contract or no , that' s what you is .
now , the mexicans see your color , you tell ' em , " don' t shoot . " they pass you by .
but mr. william , he gonna give me a gun , and i' il ...
you clean up their shit , you take care of their horses , you wash ' em , you feed ' em .
damn if you ain' t gonna die for ' em , too .
where is everybody ?
30 men from here in gonzales have already left for the alamo .
assemblethementhatwehave .
we need more men .
if they arrive every day , soon we will have enough .
but for now , we wait .
if we can' t run , we walk .
if we can' t walk , we crawl .
but we gotta go to the aid of those boys .
it' s only right .
general , i' m the man who left travis there .
i do not enjoy waiting any more than the next man , but i will not sacrifice texas .
these 1 24 men cannot pierce an army of thousands .
colonel fannin is en route from goliad with 400 men .
these troops need training .
i suggest that you commence with it .
