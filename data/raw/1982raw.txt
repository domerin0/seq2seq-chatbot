carlo , i wanted to ask you for something , because if i ask nicola he won' t reply to me .
do you know matteo well ?
of course .
tell me then , what' s wrong with him ?
what do you mean ?
i mean he' s always angry .
come on , let' s go study !
we were talking !
you' re always talking ...
oh , wait a minute , i' ve got something for you .
i' ve had it in the car for a week .
where did you get it ?
i traded for it .
what should i do with it ?
you' re a student in medicine , maybe you' il need it .
how are you , mate ?
quite well .
but in case of a turning point in the situation , so to speak , can i use your holiday home ?
the holiday home is a great idea !
don' t even think about it !
what ?
that house is perfect !
perfect ?
last time you used it you made such a mess that my mother' s still crying !
not again please !
yes again please .
enough !
by the way , i spoke with my father .
and ?
and he' il lend us the car !
great !
this is good news !
did you tell him we' re going to cape north ?
i told him it' s an educational journey around europe .
so we' il leave after the exams ?
yes , only we can' t push the engine over 4, 000 revolutions .
so ?
are you coming to carlo' s holiday home ?
you and i ?
yes .
alone ?
of course .
it' s beautiful , the sand is golden , it' s full of " tamarix aphilla " , and flying dolphins ...
it' s beautiful , and i love you .
you' re always kidding nicola .
no , i' m serious !
i love you , i swear .
come on , let' s dance .
did you ask your dad about that job ?
you must be at the clinic on monday morning .
do you have the address ?
it' s called " speech therapy
you only have to take our patient for a walk , and chat with her to help her feel " normal " .
you don' t have to make friends with her , it' s just a therapy .
giorgia has been well for a while now , so we need you only twice a week .
follow me .
there she is .
you' il see it' s easier than walking a dog .
what' s your name ?
what' s your name ?
what' s your name ?
giorgia , don' t speak to people you don' t know .
what' s your name ?
matteo .
mad matteo , madly mad matteo ...
watch out !
don' t touch me !
i won' t touch you , but watch out .
look left then right .
go .
do you like it here ?
i come here often .
it soothes my nerves .
and there are no cars ...
there' s a beautiful place here .
would you like to see it ?
would you ?
when i' ve had enough of studying at home i come here .
i like it here .
at this hour it' s almost desert too .
shall we read something ?
yes .
trains .
trains ?
trains what ?
what time they leave or arrive ...
oh , the timetable .
there' s no timetable here , sorry .
but there' s a book i' d like to read to you , a book of poems .
wait , where' s ... ... american literature ?
it' s not easy to cover the percentage of life ..
she deals the cards to catch you in weakness , not in full strength .
she gives you 70 years to play .
if you can' t in 70 years , you can no more .
leave the room if you lose .
leave when your time' s over .
only cowards stay and hang on to the cards .
hey , look out !
mind the cars !
oh my god !
hey , careful !
what are you doing ?
don' t touch me !
i' m not touching you .
fuck you !
i won' t touch you but you want to be run over !
idiot , cockhead , shitface !
listen , do you know what death is ?
asshole !
no , you' re an asshole !
fuck you !
no fuck you !
are you crazy ?
okay let' s go now .
to the clinic .
you don' t like me ?
you can stay there .
you only have to say it .
here you are .
come on !
so it' s normal , but what am i supposed to do ?
nothing , you don' t have to react .
if you stay quiet she' il calm down .
but , professor ...
call me by name , please ...
alright .
but maybe i did something wrong ?
no , you didn' t , my dear .
it' s her disease' s fault , not yours .
but that' s what we' re for .
hey , is it ready ?
did you wash it ?
i never ask them to wash my car .
they like it .
it' s their pastime .
but you can' t mortgage this house !
this is your children' s house ...
to mortgage a house is a normal thing .
the problem is that you' re from milan .
you are extraordinary people ,
you' re intelligent ...
what' s that supposed to mean ?
and so you lack imagination . ability to dream .
sure , imagination ...
chicca ?
what are you doing still up ?
come here .
how long have they been fighting ?
since the film ended .
and did it and well ?
yes .
he was a king and he didn' t know , then he knew it and married the princess .
that' s bad .
why ?
because then they' il fight like mom and dad .
you must promise me that when you grow old you' il never get married .
i want to marry you .
and nicola too .
you can' t marry your brothers , especially two of them together .
so ...
let' s put alice to bed and make them stop . ... if you have a head on your shoulders .
hey people ...
will you stop it please ?
hey , will you stop it ?
what are you doing here ?
poor thing , you' re still up .
how could she sleep with all that noise ?
tell me , what should i do ?
leave matteo be , don' t involve him in this .
you and nicola must defend me against your father .
what ?
matteo , am i a bad father ?
yes , wanna know what the good father did ?
he mortgaged his house .
you mortgaged this house ?
no , the palace of caserta .
of course , i own this house here !
did you understand ?
if his job ends badly we' il go to sleep under a bridge .
under a bridge !
matteo , that' s cool !
oh , finally someone who loves adventure !
sure , we' il live like tramps under a bridge .
but who cares of how his job ends ?
you' re insane too !
he' s right , not insane !
leave it all to me .
i' m the head of the family .
what does that mean ?
it means i know when i can invest money .
you have to beat competition , understand ?
and then , i can smell a good deal .
you smell good deals ?
i thought that you could smell a fart !
go , go ...
what a pity i can' t ask for divorce in this country .
divorce ?
like the american ladies ?
yes like that .
well , see you .
you' re going out again ?
yes , nicola and the others are waiting for me .
where are you going ?
around .
girls ?
who knows ...
where is she ?
with a client , i think .
shall we wait here ?
yes this is her fire .
it' s a bit embarrassing .
it' s not .
she' il be here soon .
is that her ?
yes .
what' s happening ?
hi cati .
hi matteo .
who was that ?
who are those ?
my brother and two friends .
hi .
hi .
so , shall we go to your place ?
come in .
can i leave the light on ?
so the hens think it' s day and they' il eat .
it' s okay .
don' t you get undressed ?
are you ashamed ?
understood .
i' il turn around .
look , maybe it' s better if we do nothing .
but i' il pay you all the same .
are you sick ?
no , i' m not , but ...
i don' t know .
maybe ...
come on .
listen , are you matteo' s brother ?
yes , why ?
because you two are different .
you aren' t like him .
really ?
why , what' s he like ?
he' s weird .
well , anyway ...
let' s do it quick or you' il make me waste too much time .
no .
don' t kiss my lips .
hi giorgia .
why are you staying here in the dark ?
don' t you want to go out ?
everyone' s in the garden .
can i take some pictures of you ?
the light is perfect .
come on , look at me .
well ?
alright , i' il photograph your hands .
your hands are pretty , did you know that ?
what' s that ?
what did they do to you ?
please read and comment on this page .
it' s a poem by sennuccio del bene .
i know , but what does it suggest to you ?
nothing .
nothing ?
why ?
because it' s empty .
sennuccio del bene is empty too .
then give me an example of a religious poet you like in particular .
il beccaio .
are you kidding me ?
il beccaio , is a modest imitator of cecco angiolieri , and can' t be considered as one of the religious rhymers .
he curses his father and his mother .
is that a religious poet ?
i think so .
well , i don' t , and i know a little more than you .
what are you doing ?
i got annoyed .
yes those marks were left by electrical discharges .
she was electroshocked .
where did you take the picture ?
isn' t the electroshock forbidden ?
unfortunately no .
who' s that girl ?
i' il tell you later .
go study now .
isn' t your exam tomorrow ?
yes .
wish me good luck .
the teacher is a tough one .
i wish i got full marks like you .
full marks ...
are you coming with carlo and berto tomorrow ?
so we can leave as soon as i' ve failed ?
no , come and take me from " the hole " .
i' m going to sleep there .
with whom ?
hi antonio .
hey , most illustrious one , why here so late ?
sorry , i forgot a book in the hall upstairs .
i can' t move from here .
don' t worry , i' il go get it .
if you wake them up , you' il entertain them .
esposti giorgia , pietracamela " .
giorgia ?
giorgia , wake up .
wake up , giorgia .
don' t be afraid , it' s matteo .
listen to me carefully .
now you take all your stuff and we' il leave .
i' il take you away .
you deserved 28 or 29 , but i' m giving you 30 because of what i call
sympathy quotient
it' s not much , but it' s enough to make you get 30 .
someone disagrees with this quotient thing of mine , but i think that sympathy , from the greek word " sympazein " which means " share the pathos " , or other people' s sufferings , is very important for a doctor .
to others i apply the " antipathy quotient " .
it means i lower their marks .
antipathy is the worst thing for a doctor .
i think you are praiseworthy , congratulations .
but don' t get big headed .
you have to do two more exams with me ,
i can still tear you to pieces .
who are those ?
friends of yours ?
did you take the claque with you ?
no .
well ... we have to leave together , so ...
they came here to ...
are they in my class ?
i can' t remember them ..
ahem , no .
carlo studies economics , berto philosophy .
don' t tell me the story of their lives .
i' m just happy to know they' il cause damage somewhere else .
economics , philosophy .
wow !
as i said , you' re promising .
and i may be wrong , but i want to give you a piece of advice .
if you' re you somehow ambitious , leave .
leave italy .
leave italy as quickly as you can .
do you want to be a surgeon ?
i still don' t know .
whatever you decide , go to study in london or paris .
go to america if you can , but leave this country .
italy should be destroyed .
it' s a beautiful and useless place , destined to die .
you mean the doomsday is about to come ?
i wish .
we would be forced to rebuild all if it did , while everything remains motionless instead , in the hands of the dinosaurs .
listen to me , go away .
why are you staying though ?
me ?
my dear , because i' m one of the dinosaurs .
move aside please .
aside , aside , we' re leaving !
i had thirty !
how can you have 30 at your first exam !
you' re sick !
so , matteo' s in " the hole " ?
yes .
drive faster !
i can' t .
4, 000 revolutions , remember ?
yes but 4, 000 ...
come on , 4, 000 !
4, 000 my foot !
weeeeee !
faster !
giorgia ?
giorgia !
wake up , it' s time to go .
i made you some coffee .
sugar ?
one , two ?
no sugar ?
... i understand if he was referring to your specialisation ,
but i don' t think that going abroad to find a job can ...
so you think we' il all find a job in italy ?
yes , our yearly growth is at 7 % and unemployment is at 3 % .
what does it mean ?
it means things are going well because unemployment increases when growth goes below 4 % .
you mean that will be begged to work ?
no , that' s a bit too much , also because within the next few years plenty of people will graduate .
inflation should increase a little .
so to speak , natural selection will take place .
let' s say that out of 3 graduated people , one won' t find any job .
basically the dumbest of the three .
hey now , why don' t you all go to ...
i think we should take the " statale appenninica " .
sure , so we' il need 20 days to reach turin .
okay but girls don' t hitchhike on the highway .
he fixed his mind on that !
on what ?
but where' s matteo ?
i have no idea .
you should go and check .
okay , i' il get the keys and ...
oh , there he is , finally .
who' s that ?
i don' t know her .
he was supposed to come alone ?
i don' t know anything .
wait here , please .
we said no girlfriends !
let' s hear what he has to say before .
maybe she isn' t coming with us .
that girl looks strange .
there' s something about her .
who' s she ?
the girl in the pictures ?
but what' s the problem ?
nothing , it' s a delicate matter .
and ?
see you at the brennero .
did you go crazy ?
are you joking ?
we were supposed to be at the brennero by night .
we' il be a day behind now .
calm down .
we' il never get to hamburg .
calm down .
see you at the customs in two days .
it' s because of her ?
yes , because of her .
did she run away from home ?
kind of .
where are you going ?
we' il take you there .
no , we' il take care of it .
okay then , good trip !
you too .
good trip .
see you .
good trip .
don' t go too fast , okay ?
i won' t .
i don' t know , when i saw how bad she felt i thought ...
you did the right thing .
and that matter of the electroshock too ...
you' re right , it' s horrible .
but we have to take her somewhere now .
her mom is dead .
her dad lives in a place called pietracamela .
pietracamela ?
where is it ?
i don' t know , maybe in the appennino .
we could take her there , then leave .
alright .
giorgia ?
come here .
see how strange she acts ?
yes , but why ?
she' s nuts !
no she isn' t .
she looks intelligent .
giorgia !
do you remember me ?
how are you , giorgia ?
my bishop forgets me , while you still love don vito , don' t you ?
look at you !
you' re so pretty ...
who are those ?
hello .
hello .
nicola .
vito .
matteo , nice to meet you .
what' s the matter ?
we' re looking for giorgia' s father .
he moved a few years ago .
he lives in ravenna now .
in ravenna ?
yes , he moved there three or four years ago .
are you from the institute ?
yes , from villa quieta .
and so young ...
good boys .
and how come you brought her here ?
for summer holidays .
for summer .
she was confirmed like all the others , because children are all the same for me .
aren' t they , giorgi ' ?
do you remember ...
lord , i' m not worthy of you , but just say a word and my soul will be saved .
she' s so pretty .
very good !
as a child she knew the angel' s prayer .
but the word of god was nothing serious for her .
so it is for many other people .
you' re right .
what' s your name again ?
matteo .
and yours ?
nicola .
good boy , nico '
maybe it was her mother' s death .
she died when giorgia was a child , and she kind of became obsessed .
she cleaned everything , over an over again .
she cleaned her room , the kitchen , the stable ...
who knows why .
what time is the next bus to ravenna ?
it' s just left !
if you only said it earlier ..
there' s another one at 7 a . m . which arrives in the afternoon .
tomorrow morning ?
we must leave immediately .
immediately ?
that cannot be .
it' s impossible .
what are we going to do now ?
you could stay at my place .
i have a kind of ... not a stable , a depot .
better than a poke in the eye , or a kick in the face !
isn' t it ?
for you madam , here' s the royal suite .
you can lay down on this wonderful bed .
there' s also a fantastic spar so you can have your privacy , separated from the two heroes , ajax and achilles .
there' s also a beautiful blanket , by kind concession of the clergy .
so if you' re cold you can put it on .
but i' m not getting undressed .
i' m not .
that' s fine .
you know what ?
i won' t get undressed too .
okay , let' s get some sleep now .
giorgia ...
tomorrow you' il sleep in a real bed in your father' s house .
i don' t have a father .
i don' t .
give me that !
thief !
give me that , bastard asshole !
you' re a thief !
a thief !
let go of it !
it' s mine !
giorgia !
come inside !
leave me be !
leave you be ?
leave me be !
leave me be !
leave me be !
thief !
thief !
look ...
i' m not a thief !
you are !
sorry , i didn' t know it was yours .
you' re a thief !
i found it on the floor !
enough !
what' s wrong ?
nothing , i took a noteb
but i didn' t know it was hers !
go away !
you have to go away !
leave it to me .
giorgia , let' s go inside , it' s raining .
enough !
come on , we' re getting wet here .
let' s go back inside , please .
maybe you better wear something dry .
i' il give you something mine .
do you like it ?
put it on .
are you ashamed ?
you can go behind the curtain .
come on .
next time you want to shower , just let me know , and i' il book you a room at the grand hotel .
done ?
how long does it take ?
the buttons ...
may i ?
yes .
i' il help you .
buttons are the hardest thing .
shoelaces too , but buttons are really complicated .
imagine if don vito comes in now .
he would curse us and we' d go to hell .
you have a beautiful smile .
you' re good , see ?
let' s sleep now .
let' s go to beddy byes .
shall i turn off the light ?
no .
no no .
alright , lights on .
good night .
what happened ?
nothing .
good morning madam .
excuse me ...
good morning .
do you know where mr. saro lives ?
he lives here , he' s my husband .
where is he now ?
what' s wrong ?
nothing , it' s a personal matter .
aren' t you giorgia ?
you should have been in the institute .
and who are those ?
fatty ...
giorgia ...
what are you doing here ?
what happened ?
we don' t think the institute is the right place for her .
what ?
she is ill treated there .
and when she has a crisis they electroshock her .
electroshock ?
yes .
and what' s that ?
electric discharges .
aren' t they painful ?
they are .
i pay a lot of money to the institute so she can recover and be well ...
why don' t you keep her with you instead ?
i can' t , i have other children .
then keep her in the family with her siblings .
they aren' t her siblings , they' re rosa' s kids .
rosa loves you , and they do as well , but you don' t get along with them .
in fact
i put you in that clinic hoping for you to feel well , and recover your health .
giorgia , now these people will take you back to the clinic .
why don' t you try to take her with you ?
they' il take you back so you' il be fine .
giorgia doesn' t need a doctor .
she needs a father .
i am a father !
i love you giorgia , you know that .
then show her you do .
take her to your house .
i cannot do that !
life' s expensive nowadays ,
i already spend a lot for the clinic ...
money' s nothing to do with her .
she needs love .
we love her !
but ...
she feels awful , i know that !
hey i' m not forced to speak about my family
with two strangers !
what kind of father are you ?
and who the hell are you ?
she' s your daughter !
she' s my daughter so she' s none of your business !
none of my business ?
hey calm down !
calm down !
stop it now !
damn you !
where are we going now ?
i don' t know .
you should think twice before hitting her father !
she can come with us .
with us where ?
to the appointment with carlo and berto .
and what about the customs ?
where' s her passport ?
you should use your head sometimes !
are you hungry ?
no .
you don' t eat or drink .
do you live on air ?
and stop that  leave her alone !
she cut herself .
come on , get a towel !
what if she cut her vein ?
come on ...
maybe we should take her to the er .
there' s no need for that .
get a towel please .
this is the cheyenne method .
drooling dew
what happened ?
nothing , we broke a glass .
korea scored .
who cares ?
in fact we couldn' t care less .
less than nothing .
on the contrary , i' m a fan of korea .
ko re a !
ko re a !
bye .
bye .
wait for me here then .
what will you tell giovanna ?
i' il tell her that we got a problem after leaving .
but what if she asks why carlo and berto aren' t with us ?
trust me , okay ?
i don' t trust my sister .
she could send us to jail .
that' s why i' m going alone .
what about us ?
think of something .
there' s a bar , have something to drink ...
i' il leave my bags here , okay ?
see you .
bye .
do you want something to drink ?
okay , you' re mad at me .
you don' t speak to me ...
give me a sign then .
say " yes " or " no " .
was that " yes " ?
hello .
hello , can i help you ?
what would you like ?
hey !
giorgia ?
you want to listen to something ?
what' s your favourite ?
elvis ?
sandy show ?
what' s " achi " ?
oh , " a chi " , fausto leali .
let me see ...
here .
b 3 .
your friend berto did something serious .
she is under her father' s jurisdiction and he decides for her .
there' s nothing i can do .
it' s the law .
but berto thought she would be killed in that clinic .
then he could have filed a complaint .
that' s what the magistracy' s for .
he seized a person , not a knick knack .
do you ever deal with such cases ?
no , i' m dealing with that .
you won' t believe me , but thousands of people work there .
so lots of problems ?
the usual job suits , dismissals , diseases , accidents ...
i' ve an embarrassing wide choice .
plants never stop here .
they' re on 24/ 7 , all year .
that' s why the sea and the sky changed colour .
the leadership says it' s all under control , but last week they distributed this .
toothpaste ?
yes , but they advised for teeth to be brushed before meals , not after .
understand ?
not really .
it means that the powder on their teeth and gums is toxic .
and it causes cancer in the long run .
listen , it' s not berto' s problem but yours , right ?
no , it' s matteo' s instead .
he always gets in trouble .
no , i promise you it' s berto' s .
why don' t you call the psychiatric hospital in gorizia ?
there are wonderful doctors there .
they may be wonderful , but it' s still an asylum .
but their patients aren' t tied up or electroshocked .
what if we take her here ?
i am forced to report you to the local attorney .
they come here , get the girl , and take her back to her father .
clear ?
how long till the train leaves ?
half an hour .
listen , why don' t you go and buy three " zatterini " ?
me ?
yes , you .
no , i can' t .
why ?
you' ve got legs , haven' t you ?
i' il do it .
no , she will .
come on , three " zatterini " .
i can' t do it .
you can , it' s easy .
hi miss .
three " zatterini " .
three " zatterini " .
do you think we should really take her to gorizia ?
i think so .
giovanna said it' s a good hospital .
and if we don' t like the doctors , she' il spend the holidays with us .
in sicily .
here you are .
your change .
wait , miss .
your change .
hello .
hello guys .
two coffees please .
sure .
miss , you left your change .
take it .
he' s asking you to take your change ...
do you know her ?
no , i' ve never seen her before .
is anything wrong ?
i don' t know , she left her change here .
i called her , but ...
i see .
are you with someone ?
no , i' m alone .
do you carry any documents ?
she isn' t answering .
let' s take her with us .
come with us .
what about her bag ?
i don' t know ..
what' s going to happen to her ?
i don' t know .
maybe she' il be taken back to the institute .
is it possible that there' s nothing we can do ?
look , let' s catch our train tomorrow .
let' s go on with our journey .
alright .
let' s have some rest now .
matteo , what are you doing ?
my journey' s over .
over ?
what do you mean ?
i' m going to rome .
to rome ?
why ?

dear matteo ,
i' m sending this letter to mom and dad so that they can give it to you .
where are you ?
did you hear from carlo and berto ?
i never met them ,
i travelled alone .
by the way here i am .
norway is a wonderful place .
people are particularly striking .
martin , for example , is american , and he' s a deserter .
he left america because he didn' t want to go to vietnam ,
holy ...
the world is holy .
the soul is holy .
the tongue , the cock , and hand
and asshole are holy .
who wrote that ?
a genius .
what' s their name ?
allen ginsberg .
savages ...
i left my companions and i' m heading north .
you won' t believe me , but i am in front of a small wooden church a few steps from a stone which says that the polar arctic circle line passes through here .
right now my fellow students are having lesson with the old dinosaur , but i don' t feel guilty ,
i don' t feel like i' m wasting my time .
dear beast ,
i' ve something important to tell you .
i' il never shave or a have a haircut again .
i' m sending you a picture to show you how i look .

he' s a weirdo .
he' s crazy !
how are you ?
he hurt me .
my money' s gone , so i' il look for a job in some local sawmill .

i don' t want to go out !
fine .
you won' t go out tomorrow and the day after tomorrow too !
the confined ones stay here .

sometimes i think of giorgia . ... of the fact we couldn' t protect her .
maybe when i' m back i' il become a psychiatrist .
we must do something for people like her .
they mustn' t be electroshocked .
you' re great , matteo .
you made fun of the lieutenant .
but you' re strange .
you had him confine you for three days .
and you could have found a better excuse .
that' s the truth .
i am unemployed , i want to make a military career .
didn' t you say you' re the only one with a job ?
that' s the only lie i told .
you should make a career here too .
are you nuts ?
you can become a general .

i' m not going back to rome .
and what about university ?
i' il enroll somewhere else .
after what i saw around europe
i can' t keep on living with mom and dad .

our house is on the hills , so it wasn' t damaged .
and so the marquis sent his daughters ... to say thank you all .
how nice of him !
him ?
i' m the one who' s carrying the cart !
just kidding .
i' ve played the piano since i was 10 .
now i' m a maths ' student in turin .
what' s maths got to do with the piano ?
my mother chose the piano , i chose maths .
but why maths ?
because i wanted to solve the famous problem of the jealous husbands .
what' s that ?
you don' t know it ?
no .
there are three married couples .
married ?
yes .
how boring ...
they have to cross a river .
they only have a boat which can carry two people .
the jealous husbands don' t want their wives to remain with the other men .
of course .
where' s the riddle ?
how do they cross the river ?
it' s easy .
so ...
two wives go first .
one gets back and takes her husband ... ... to the other side .
mind your own business .
she leaves him there , gets back and ...
no .
she leaves him there .
no .
two husbands go first ...
it' s the same , isn' t it ?
i give up .
it' s easy you said ?
no , i' il solve it .
maybe another time .
okay .
once you' ve graduated , ... will you be a teacher or a pianist ?
not a teacher .
not even a pianist , i think .
you know your business !
you must do both things .

let' s start over .
hi matteo .
how are you ?

i' il show you the house .
what do you need to get out of here ?
gotta ask for 70 permissions to the minister of the interior ?
gotta lick the floor where the head of police walked ?

i only need to sign some papers .

tota " means " miss " in dialect .

ay , my good sire ?
light of my life !
you always forget the keys .
sorry love .
he' s matteo .
hi .
hi .
come in .
thanks .
gigi is paralysed .
you met him during the flood in firenze .
remember ?
of course .
we look like the same in our uniforms .
is he a friend of yours ?
we' re all friends .
that' s bad !
really why ?
because you' re on the wrong side .
are you sure ?
yes .
and which one' s the right side ?
the side of the poor ?
exactly .
luigi knows what to be poor means .
he is poor !
those who hit him aren' t .
are you ?
that' s nonsense !
i don' t hit innocents !
but he' s on the wheelchair , not you !
i can' t stay here anymore .
giulia , please .
nice woman ...
i see you made friends .
we' re celebrating our child' s birth in september .
a child ?
did you choose its name ?
sara !
what if it' s a boy ?
giulia says it' s a girl .
i trust her .
it' s a nice name , from the bible .
is she playing ?
yes .
she doesn' t seem mean when she' s playing .
she isn' t mean .
she thinks she' s always right .
exactly like you ...
sleep .
nicola !
does the baby have to sleep with us ?
that' s not good .
hush ...
sara , please go to the other room , will you ?
cause daddy has a little thing to do with mommy .
go !
he could have come to pick us at least !
try to be kind , and don' t say that to have kids when you have no job is crazy .
also because nicola has one .
only for six more months .
she works too .
yes , in a rubbish shop .
how can they buy clothes and miniskirts for sara ?
isn' t it early for miniskirts ?
and don' t mention the fact they aren' t married .
no one gets married anymore !
why , you wouldn' t marry me today ?
you don' t think it' s good enough ?
what are you saying !
ladder a
hi !
how are you ?
fine .
the journey ?
it was good .
open up please ?
what' s that ?
an english baby carriage .
thanks !
it' s beautiful !
here' s the rest .
put it there .
hi .
this house is big .
we were lucky to find it .
was it so coloured ?
no , i painted it .
congratulations !
she' s sleeping .
hi ... she' s so cute !
i' m grandma , and he' s grandpa .
such a cute face ...
she' s got my eyes and my chin .
you wish !
let her grow and we' il see .
she' s bigger than the last time .
she is .
if someone told me i' d become grandpa ...
sara are you happy to have such a young grandad ?
she' s looking at me !
you conquered her .
where' s nicola ?
at the court .
what happened ?
there' s a trial against a sick psychiatrist .
nicola' s there to help .
he must testify ?
no , the patients will .
they were accepted as witnesses .
let' s hope that the judge trusts them .
it would be the first time in italy .
no , in the world !
marino , when they say " swear to tell the truth " ...
you all listen , because you all will be asked for that .
i do " .
marino , repeat please .
i do .
good . otherwise they won' t listen to you .
when did you first enter the mental hospital ?
i was four ...
no you were 8 .
you must say that , okay ?
yes , i was 8 , i liked to dress like a girl .
and they weren' t supposed to shut you in .
when i see the " electrician " ,
i' il break his bones !
calm down !
you won' t do that because you' re good .
nicola !
you' il calm down .
promise me , aldo .
look me in the eye .
nicola ?
will you stay calm ?
nicola !
nicola !
yes , mario ?
it looks like my cousin ignazio .
that' s true !
where did you find those ?
behind the statue .
don' t pick up anything , please .
you all don' t .
who brought them in ?
swear to tell the truth .
they made us enter together .
they had us lay down on the lined up beds .
no !
you must say " i do " first .
i do .
eight years old .
10 times in the hospital .
10 times in the hospital .
the witness is playing a part someone taught him !
of course he needs to calm down a little .
mr. president ...
mr. levi , please say " i do " .
i do .
please go ahead .
when the electric doctor came into the room ...
i closed my eyes , but i could hear those besides me screaming .
four nurses blocked my hands and feet .
i felt a hand putting some rubber stuff inside my mouth .
then the first shock came .
once i escaped from the hospital , but they found me again .
they hit me hard then tied me up to the bed again .
and then the electrician with his machine came in .
while he shocked me , he shouted
tell me who helped you escape !
i didn' t want to tell him .
so i pressed my jaws together ... so hard that i broke all my upper teeth .
giovanbattista , are you listening ?
here' s the record of your last deposition .
please repeat what you know here .
look at him .
is that the man you referred to ?
can you speak ?
you said ...
the doctor gave me electromassages because i drank .
did you say that ?
i had 5 in 5 days
is that true ?
five of them is normal for alcoholics .
shut up !
shut up !
you won' t kill people anymore !
calm down .
if something like that happens again i' il clear the courtroom .
i apologise for aldo and for all the others .
they' re upset , it' s not easy for them to speak in tranquillity .
giovanbattista can' t speak at all .
i know silence is no evidence , but it' s all he has to give .
i hope he gets eight life sentences .
i' d be happy if he got a day .
it' s a matter of principle .
why did dad come to turin ?
he has a project and is looking for a sponsor .
he says we should pass from typing machines to don' t know what , processors , computers ...
i don' t know .
i have to tell you something .
he doesn' t know i found them .
he won' t tell me about it .
but he seems worried .
i never searched his drawers before .
you' re a doctor .
can you do something ?
no mom .
but the course of illness can be slackened by some medicine .
it could take years before ...
i know , i read everything i could find .
i read the same thing you said , that nothing can be done .
what are you doing ?
i' m writing some notes for the trial .
you' re a disaster , you type with two fingers !
let me type .
no , there' s no need to .
please !
i want to help .
the lawyer said that the treatments weren' t a punishment and also stated that homosexuality is a disease which needs curing .
why , isn' t it a disease ?
no dad , it isn' t .
are you sure ?
i am .
okay then i believe you .
what a piece of crap !
change the carriage at least !
it' s good for me .
cut it out .
but it' s out of fashion , a general change is needed .
i have an idea , i' m looking for a sponsor .
as a matter of fact , if you don' t mind ,
i' d like to stay in turin for a while , to look for this sponsor .
there are many experts in mechanics here .
of course dad , it' s good for you to get busy .
i thought you' d say i' m crazy as you mom does ...
no you aren' t crazy , you look ahead , you already live in the future .
you aren' t fit for this world .
and what about mom ?
is she staying too ?
no , she' s leaving .
it' s already strange that she left francesca alone for 4 days .
look , one of these days i' d like to go and see giovanna in milan .
i' il take a train .
no , i' il take you there .
don' t bother , i can  it' s fine , so i can also see carlo .
do you remember carlo ?
of course i do .
isn' t he teaching in england ?
yes , he' s only passing by .
so i can say hi to him .
i could tell him about my project .
in england there are business banks .
it' s not like in italy .
maybe he knows someone .
okay , dictate .
what , are you playing ?
you can' t play with two six of flowers .
take them back .
sorry .
but i scored 40 points all the same .
you didn' t .
count them .
come on .
3 times 6 makes 18 , 20 , 22 ...
see , you didn' t reach 40 .
i didn' t .
sorry .
adriana , listen .
yes ?
as regards that thing that nowadays no one gets married ,
i think that nowadays
i would marry you .
my little thing .
did you find a house ?
no .
there' s a dormitory here , but no one wants to sleep in it .
it' s fine with me .
i don' t like houses .
why did you come here from the scientific section in bologna ?
i didn' t choose to .
they said you need people here .
but you could say " no " .
i never say " no " to orders .
what are you doing ?
drop it , won' t you ?
what have you got in there ?
books .
books ?
yes , books .
you' re a strange type .
i read your characteristic signs and what did i find there ?
nothing
i found .
apart from some mess .
hot blooded , aren' t you ?
you' re a fighter , right ?
why did you join the police ?
what were you looking for ?
rules .
and what do you make of them ?
i follow them .
do you ?
yes .
i do what i' m told to .
then i mind my own business .
then you fit this place .
sicily is the home of those who mind their own business .
what ?
he was shot in the head .
and there' s a hole in his brain .
you live nearby .
commissary , we' re done .
wait a minute , please .
so you found the body ?
yes .
early morning ?
yes .
what were you doing here so early ?
i was pasturing the donkey .
oh , the donkey .
yes .
but the donkey found the body , or you did ?
i did .
oh , you did .
and you touched it ?
no .
good boy , you didn' t have to .
but you looked at him .
who' s that ?
does he live here ?
yes .
so you knew him ?
did you know him or not ?
i didn' t .
you didn' t ?
if he lived here , you had to know him .
tell me the truth , come on .
did you recognise him ?
did you know him ?
i did .
good boy .
you knew him then .
and tell me , was he a good man ?
he was .
those who knew him knew he was good .
a good man ...
but why do you say he was good , when others say he wasn' t ?
how do i know ?
i know nothing of nothing .
right .
after a certain point you don' t know anything anymore .
may the rats eat that bastard !
bastard ...
may he rest in peace .
bastard .
may he rest in peace , yes .
okay , i got it .
did you see ?
please everyone show the due respect to the court .
whatever the verdict is ,
i don' t want to hear any noise or comment .
the court , according to articles 483 and 488 of the code of criminal procedure , finds the defendant guilty of the crime he' s accused of , and sentences him to 5 years ' imprisonment , and the payment of legal costs .
order !
order !
i must say i like these colours after getting used to them .
and these drawings are really nice .
congratulations .
listen ...
can i ask you for something ?
sure .
there' s a piano in the other room , why don' t you ever play it ?
i never play it because
i' m not good enough .
one can' t be only a little good , so i decided to stop playing .
i didn' t ask you why you don' t play in front of an audience .
i meant why don' t you play it here ?
at home , for yourself .
for myself ?
what' s wrong ?
i' m done .
why ?
because i made lots of mistakes .
i didn' t notice them .
you didn' t , but i did .
but you' re playing for me so they don' t count .
ahead with this ravel , come on .
i like ravel .
do you ever ask her to play ?
no .
why ?
because i know she doesn' t want to .
that' s not true , she played the other day .
she did it for you .
it was a special thing .
you don' t understand .
you' re so smart and yet you don' t get it .
women must be told they' re good , that they' re beautiful , that they' re the best thing we have .
giulia play for me " .
play for the two of us " .
you should behave as i did with your mother .
what ?
you fight all the time !
fights are good ,
they' re good to keep fit .
the 26 principles and the 109 recommendations of the un approved in stockholm 2 years ago , are constantly disregarded in italy .
above all by people like those who are to be judged today , and for whom i ask for the maximum of the penalty .
i also ask for them to be charged of the legal costs and of the damage costs .
because they willingly discharged waste products to a river damaging the environment and the health of the citizens .
think of this : in the last ten years 1 . 870 billion dollars a year were spent for military purposes .
a year , understand ?
now , 50 % of this money was spent for bribes , also in italy .
wouldn' t you put them under arrest ?
give me the names .
tell her about public enterprises .
what are you , a prompter ?
no , she knows about those , as the names are in the papers too .
but she has to read them .
dad ?
what ...
look .
old chopsticks .
dad ?
" folk " .
okay , okay ...
don' t listen to him .
this is the crab' s technique .
sure , it' s the calamari' s .

he wants to sign the banknotes .
let' s drink to the future governor .

i know it sounds absurd , but if you want him to think he can make it , you must believe it too .
not just pretend .
but he doesn' t know we know .
it doesn' t matter .

he can feel you all .

i talked nonsense .
try not to behave like an asshole in england .
try not to behave like an asshole here .
i didn' t tell anyone .
not even nicola .
he would have started with psychology , with the fact that you need to react , all that bullshit , you know .
i told you ... because i told you .
this is our secret .
you must promise me , because i don' t want anyone' s pity .
but you must promise me you' il have yourself cured , and tested and so on .
i' il do everything .
be patient with matteo .
i don' t know why , but i' ve never understood him .
and i' m sorry for that .
then there' s francesca ... and mom , and nicola .
nicola is strong .
he isn' t all the time .
he' s like everyone else .
and last but not least you have to take care of yourself .
you have to smile .
be cheerful , have fun .
where' s your husband ?
out for work ?
we haven' t seen each other for a while .
there are some problems .
another woman ?
not at all .
there are just some problems .
i think we' il ask for separation .
separation ?
and you weren' t telling me ?
i' m sorry .
i' m not .
it' s better this way .
it is !
we' il find another one .
are you looking for mystery ?
are you talking to me ?
you must find the soul .
how can i find it ?
you have to search for it , look inside people .
palermo , summer of 1977
can you look inside ?
i can .
see that child ?
look at his hand .
he' s confident .
he has a cockade on his shirt , he' s top of the form .
maybe .
see that old lady ?
two wedding rings , she' s a widow .
and she feels lonely .
you aren' t sicilian .
are you making fun of me ?
did you see the film " stromboli " ?
the one with ingrid bergman ?
yes .
that' s where i live .
but i' il leave soon .
i applied for a job as a librarian in palermo .
i want to leave the island .
what about that ?
it' s a professional camera .
are you an expert ?
i' m an expert in libraries too .
are you ?
i am .
so if i got the job , what library should i choose ?
in palermo i don' t know , but in rome there' s a beautiful one in villa celli montana .
can i look for mystery ?
come on ...
sorry i have to go .

nicola .
mirella .

bye nicola .
what happened ?
someone was killed .
the commissary wants you to take some photos .
i don' t have the camera .
i do .
wow , you never forget anything , do you ?
where did you find it ?
look at me !
that' s too easy .
look at daddy .
look at me .
i hurt myself .
how many times must i say sara must be in bed at this hour ?
did the doctor prescribe that ?
daddy' s a doctor !
he can decide !
what' s wrong ?
i' m tired .
i fought with stefania .
i told her i' m done with the shop .
i' ve had enough of arguing all the time .
you used to like arguing .
i did once .
maybe it' s better this way , so you can go back to play the piano .
i sold it .
someone will take it away tomorrow .
are you crazy ?
maybe i am .
where have you been ?
do you control me ?
i went to a meeting of the collective .
anything against that ?
those are really good people ...
what do you mean ?
there' s nothing decent in this country .
everything sucks .
and we do nothing about it .
did you hear of that boy who was killed in bologna ?
yes , i did .
and when are we going to make them cry too ?
when are we going to make them cry too ?
take off that thing !
you' re ridiculous !
listen ...
let go of me .
you can' t even stand me now ?
no !
i can' t even stand you .
you only care for your hospital .
everything' s on my shoulders .
i don' t agree .
i hate arguments !
i hate fighting couples !
ladies and gentlemen ?
ladies and gentlemen ?
bobby can' t sleep with this noise .
you' re right , love .
we' il all stay quiet now .
dear carlo ,
i' m happy to hear of your success in cambridge .
here things are the same as usual .
it' s not easy to work inside the institutions , trying to change them little by little .
giulia and i have got problems .
she became aggressive and hostile .
she' s unsatisfied with something i can' t understand .
we' ve slept like brother and sister for 6 months now .

who sends these inspectors , i wonder ...
the minister of health , madam .

and who are you ?

a judge ?
please open up .
i' m a psychiatrist .

here' s the dormitory .
as you see it' s clean everything' s tidy .
where are the patients ?
i sent them to a trip to the sanctuary of europa , because i care for them .
i want them to feel well , to have fun .
to feel like normal people .
where are you going ?

there' s just a basement .
what' s inside here ?

you must have a search warrant first !
i want to call my lawyer first !

... water ... water ...

untie them and cover them .
please marshal ...
giorgia ?

it' s okay , i' il manage it .
thanks .
how are you ?
did you eat ?
do you want some ?
remember the journey we took together ?
don vito' s village ?
that time we slept in a hayloft .
do you remember the soccer match ?
italy were losing and we laughed and laughed ...
do you remember matteo ?
the orange .
it must drink or it' il die .
you' re right .
i always forget it .
sorry , i won' t touch you .
but i' d like you to come here every day ,
to water the plant , or it' il die .
the judge ?
did you call him ?
yes .

first the judge comes and then we move it .
always the same questions .
our shift' s over .
the shift you said ?
there' s a dead man here !
enzo , what did i say ?

there' s a child here !

who do you think you are ?
how dare you ?
do you think it' s a nice show ?
there' s a dead man here !
it' s not a film .
where were you when he was shot ?
i don' t know !
i don' t remember , i wasn' t here !
he doesn' t know !
like the rest of you , nobody knows !
he died by himself !
and then show him to children too , so they can learn .
go away .
don' t touch my son !
what are you teaching him ?
you won' t touch him !
here' s an extraordinary permit .
i don' t want to see you for 2 weeks .
go on holiday , go home , do as you please , but get lost .
i already have too many problems here .
what do you want to prove ?
out of my sight !
get lost !
carati , what happened ?
all' s well .
but will you be transferred ?
nah .
special leave .
that' s how it works .
it could have been worse .
oh , here you are .
it arrived this morning .
dear matteo ,
i have good news .
i found giorgia .
i think she suffered a lot , but it seems as if time stopped for her .
i was very excited when i found her .
i remembered that summer of many years ago , when my life , yours , and many others ' changed .
and i thought why don' t you leave the headquarter for a few days and come to see her in turin ?
what took place in april wasn' t an isolated phenomenon , it wasn' t just an outbreak of violence , because it followed 50 days of fights at the flat , fights which involved a huge number of workers and blocked the whole production cycle , showing how much power the workers have on a political and organizational level .
i don' t like it .
too bureaucratic .
there' s a difference between desires and needs .
needs are a serious matter .
needs lead us to bring it all up for discussion , to risk everything , to die and fight , if necessary .
for example the need for communism ...
hi .
hi .
excuse me .
you came home earlier today .
yes , i did .
hi sara .
hi .
are you drawing ?
yes .
let' s go for a walk .
hurray !
enclosed space is not good for a child .
and for people' s brains .
the need for communism ...
i need to drink , to eat ...
sara , when you hear this bullshit ...
you said a swearword !
sometimes one has to .
when someone lies to you at the kindergarten ,
what do you tell them ?
shitty liar !
good !
now let' s go out for a nice walk .
see ya' il !
see ya' il !
it' s cold outside , so we take your coat with us .
let' s go take a breath of air .
out , out ...
listen giulia ...
i know , it' s a problem i have to solve .
hello .
luigi pezzuco please .
thanks .
i was lucky too , doctors always tell me that a few more millimetres and i would have lost my arms too .
everything works instead .
almost everything .
i even met a woman .
patrizia .
let me show you ...
i have a picture of us which someone took at a party .
it has to be here ...
here it is !
she' s beautiful .
congratulations !
we' il get married in september .
we also want to have children .
you wanna know how we do it ?
slowly , patiently .
she likes it all the same , she says .
of course .
but this was only possible thanks to your mother .
my mother ?
matteo ...
i have a few notebooks like this one .
without your mother , this hand wouldn' t have recovered .
did she come here ?
once in every week .
you didn' t know ?
i did .
and not only my hand recovered .
also my brain .
i had never read poems before .
ettore , you' il be honoured with tears
shed where the holy blood you poured for your country lies ...
what did i write here ?
till the sun shines on human misfortunes " .
doctor carati ?
what a surprise !
how are you ?
fine .
you ?
fine .
the beard ?
sara says it stings .
it stings ?
yes so i shaved it .
i have a present for her .
thanks .
what' s that ?
a doll , so you can play too .
how nice !
did you pass through rome ?
yes , but didn' t stop at home .
what are those pictures ?
my patients made them .
i' m organising an exposition .
are you ?
yes .
did you know that mom went to help luigi ,
my colleague on the chair ?
yes , i knew it .
who' s that ?
my master , franco basaglia .
the one who wants to set all the nuts free ?
he has this strange feeling that mentally ill people aren' t prisoners but human beings , and that mental illness isn' t a crime to pay for .
weird guy , isn' t he ?
how is dad ?
you should go see him .
i will .
i will .
i already made up my mind .
let' s go see giorgia .
sure .
how is she ?
better .
maybe we' il discharge her .
we do it as soon as possible , and place them in small houses .
what' s wrong with them ?
once they were all " schizophrenics
which means nothing .
it means they' re like split in two ..
who isn' t ?
are you completely a policeman ?
am i completely a doctor ?
the truth is we don' t know enough about the matter .
but one thing for sure they suffer from the " mental hospital disease " .
how do you cure them ?
we open the departments .
i' il wait in my study .
you' re leaving me ?
what can i tell her ?
maybe she' il tell you something .
hi giorgia .
it' s very good to see you again .
are you well ?
you' re right , it' s a stupid question .
what does it mean ?
nicola said you can go out .
shall we go for an ice cream ?
we' il look for a juke box too .
you used to like music .
i was also told you read .
you like books .
what do you read ?
which words can reach your brain ?
you can' t hear me .

what was i like ?
madly mad matteo ...
giorgia !

she will , you' il see .
she reminded me ...

yes ?
we listened to the juke box .
she turned around and looked at me .
you were a bit in love with her ...
you were !
we both were .
what song was it ?
" a chi " by fausto leali .
a chi !
a chi !
nicola !
your father ...
could you slow down ?
slow down , no one' s after us .

i just said to slow down .

nicola says you' il be minister of treasure in 10 years .

i' m currently working for the bank of italy .
to be a minister i should change career .
you mean ?
it means ministers are politicians .
i' m only a technician .
you' re modest .
nicola says you' re smarter than him .

nicola is crazier than his patients .
that' s true .
you' re so clumsy !

i' il study literature .
i want to be an archaeologist and see the world too .

industries are being re organised .
they cut the expenses to become competitive .
who cares !

should we pay for their incapacity ?
who cares if the system blows up ?

if it did , it should be replaced by something else .

just for precaution .
" the car has been found near there .
it was stolen 10 days ago .
it' s sticky !

" his 20 year old daughter has heard the shooting .
the attorney has died before reaching the hospital .

i don' t .
you changed my life and you don' t remember ...

i was so nervous !
a few days ago nicola took her to watch " the party " .
suddenly she asked him what " a girl' s period " is , in a loud voice .
and what did he do ?
he explained it to her in front of everyone .
nicola cannot see differences .
young , old , crazy , sane are all the same to him .
listen ,
tell carlo to ask for a transfer .
he must leave italy .

he' s in danger .
the kids are small ... ... and there' s the house , and his job ...
and i know him , he' il never leave .
i have to go now .
wait !
now you listen to me .
i' il try to speak to carlo and convince him , but he' il say no .
he is your friend before being the father of my children .
you must do something .
i can' t .

then help me wear it .
i' il do your shift .

you' re a good friend !
i' m not sure this car could have made it on the highway .
hey now !
when will you change it ?
why should i ?
it' s perfect !
it' s old and it sucks .
no , it' s beautiful and perfect .
why don' t you buy a new one ?
my child' s a consumerist ...
are we poor ?
why ?
do you miss anything ?
i wish we left for christmas .
we' d have exchanged presents .
we will on new year' s eve .
who' s coming ?
granny , aunt giovanna ...
francesca ?
aunt francesca , carlo , the kids ...
they had another kid .
what' s his name ?
asdrubale teofrasto callimaco .
callimaco ?
no , nabuccodonosor .
you' re making fun of me !
his name' s michele .
michele ?
the journey started well .
the ship was good ... " " ... to cross the ocean .
the crew was good too ... " " ... and the captain was skilled .
everything was going well .
then , one night gino was getting to his cabin ... " " and he suddenly felt hungry .
let' s not show ourselves .
look at them .
yes .
they won' t sleep tonight .
who cares , they' re happy .
you' re right .
lucky you !
why ?
you have a daughter .
and ?
we' re much better than you all .
stop it ...
if you had a son you' d be wilder .
really ?
yes , but she tamed you .
you have white hair !
only a couple !
you' re a charming 40 year old man .
i' m only 37 !
but women like mature men ...
lend me your finger ...
how can you make it with 3 kids ?
one' s already too much for me ...
i' m devastated but i love it .
why is carlo escorted ?
these are hard times .
nicola ?
yes ?
nothing .
michele woke up .
can you open the door ?
why are you escorted ?
it was the winter of our discontent ...
" the accountant climbed up the stairs .
" i was forced to wait for him ...
there was also the crazy doctor !
how are you ?
fine .
yourself ?
i was thinking of places like denmark , sweden or holland .
those countries look like glass boxes .
citizens can look through them .
i dream of transparent banks , and stock exchange .
this way politics and economics would be transparent too .
cute little thing ...
did he fall asleep ?
have a look ?
not yet .
what' s wrong tonight , honey ?
he' s too excited , we arrived , he saw new faces ...
give him to me .
no , he' s about to fall asleep .
is he sleeping ?
careful .
give him to me .
mind the duck .
francesca ?
she' s sleeping .
she' s exhausted .
holidays are tiring for her .
as regards transparency ...
do you think it' s possible ?
of course , in other countries it is .
but do you think italians like transparency ?
i think it' s an illusion .
shall we put him into his cradle ?
yes .
give him to me .
don' t whisper or he won' t fall asleep .
kids like noise , they' re afraid of silence .
he' s sleeping .
he' il wake up in half an hour .
daddy' s cute baby ...
how cute you are ...
you' ve always been good with kids .
are you good with women too ?
of course .
do you have anyone ?
not a regular one .
do you have many women ?
are you jealous ?
i' il tell you a secret .
i married your sister to stay close to you .
indeed you look like a " queer " .
you too .
of course !
who are your girlfriends ?
you have a circle of nurses and anaesthetists ?
it' s none of your business !
where do you see them ?
outside .
what about sara ?
she doesn' t know .
and none of them is somehow ...
of course .
but after a while everything' s over .
you didn' t answer before .
why are you escorted ?
did you speak with francesca ?
no .
want some whisky ?
so ?
looks like i' m a target .
that' s why i' m escorted .
but why you ?
not only judges are targets , or politicians and policemen .
the other day one of my university fellow students was shot .
they say " hit one to educate 100 " they want to educate us !
they want to terrify us .
and so you' re forced to live in an armour ?
any suggestions ?
ask for a transfer abroad .
the governor wanted to send me to new york .
and ?
drink that whisky and tell me if you like it .
why didn' t you accept ?
if we all leave they' il win .
how did you find out you' re a target ?
giulia met francesca .
giulia contacted us .
she also said she wants to see the kid .
31st december 1983
there' s no room here .
i' il let francesca get off then i' il follow you .
okay .
he' s worked for me for a week .
six months ago another man who was carrying cocaine was arrested in your nightclub .

i asked some guy at the bowling .
you go there often .
he said you' re a policeman .
i should be the detective here , while everyone investigates me , instead .
you , my sister ...
everyone wants to mind my own business .
what do you want ?
i wanted to see you .
i thought we were happy together .
so what ?
nothing .
but ...
what ?
what ?
i' m busy .
why do you act like that ?
i' m on duty .
i don' t understand .
why did you lie to me ?
you' ve always lied to me !
why did you say your name' s nicola ?
i' il tell you , but not here .
fine .
i' m leaving .
fine .
you like books cause you can close them whenever you want .
life is different , you can' t decide that .
you' re wrong .
i' ve always decided .
also not to see you anymore .
that' s not a choice .
good girl , you got it !
i' m an asshole , i suck .
you better lose me .
now leave .
you aren' t like that .
what the hell ... ... do you want from me ?
nicola ...

yes !
no !
it' s a good game .
you' re snobbish !

you will , as you' re impartial .
no .
you' re a judge !
who plays the bidder ?
carlo , he' s into trade !
no !

you' re a penniless wretch .

this morning when the ambulance and the police arrived a beautiful girl came .
her hair was dark .
her eyes ...
i don' t know .
it doesn' t matter .
it was strange because your brother never brought any girl in .
such a good looking man with no girlfriends !
go ahead .
the girl asked me about your brother .
i told her what happened and she ran away .
maybe you know her .
no .
he was so good , so kind , a real gentleman !
thank you .
i' m sorry .
look , you' il think i' m crazy , but i think your brother was pushed .
nonsense !
sorry .
take this lady downstairs .
officer please .
doctor , is your brother identifying the body for the report ?

i' il do it tomorrow .
only a few of them , please .
okay .
mom !
mom !
please , stop !
mom !
enough !
enough !
calm down !
i was supposed to understand
but i didn' t .
no , maybe i understood , but ...
it was like with giulia .
i could have stopped her .
he was in front of me as well
he turned around , looked at me and i ... closed the door and deleted everything .
there' s nothing left in my mind .
the stairs of his house , the saw dust on the ground ...
nothing .
the books on the floor , the porter ...
i should have stopped them .
i loved them both , but i couldn' t chain them to that love of mine .
that was my idea of freedom .
i thought that everyone should be free to live as they wished .
what freedom is in death ?
but did it happen ?
did it really happen ?
cause i don' t believe it .
i realise what happened only when i look at mom .
i' m glad you can stay with her .
i have to leave soon though .
i asked for a transfer to sicily .
sicily ?
yes , they need people and no one wants to go there .
i still have a postcard you sent me from cape north in 1966 .
it was in norwegian , and it said : ... " everything is beautiful " with three exclamation marks .
do you still believe that ?
not to the exclamation marks .
listen giovanna .
giulia is in rome .
i' il meet her tomorrow .
she told francesca she wants to see sara .
i will go in her place .
i don' t want to listen .
giulia wants to see sara .
shut up !
this time i won' t !
the date is at the coliseum , tomorrow at 10 .
and what am i supposed to do ?
do you think it' s easy for me to ask you to arrest her and bury her in a prison ?
should i wait for her to kill someone ?
should i wait for her to be killed ?
now !
doctor carati , giorgia wants to speak with you .
tell her i can' t .
francesca !
bring her here , please .
i' il wait .
how shall i tell her ?
how can i ?
cheer up !
come on !
giorgia , i must tell you something .
a bad thing happened .
i had giulia arrested .
i thought that it was the best thing to do .
she made a bad choice , so i think it' s better this way .
then there' s another bad thing i have to tell you .
matteo ...
matteo ...
matteo is ...
matteo !
you force my thought to wander on the paths leading to the eternal void .
and all the while these evil times fleet by , bearing away the horde of cares ... " " consuming time and me .
and as i contemplate your peace ... " " ... the soul of the warrior roaring within me sleeps . " shall i comment on it ?
shall i comment on it ?
the sonnet " to the evening " is one of foscolo' s most inspired ones .
it includes an alliterated line ,
... the soul of the warrior roaring within me ... " . which is full of " rs " ...
... the soul of the warrior roaring within me
you can almost hear the poet roar .
back to your seat .
go .
adriana .
how are your french lessons going ?
well .
thanks .
your wife was told you' re here .
she isn' t my wife .
but she wants to stay in her cell .

and that i' m waiting for her .

where' s sara ?
with giovanna .
i' il call her in a minute .
but i wanted to tell you something before .
i won' t leave you alone .
you' re here but ...
i can' t hear you .
remember when we argued before sara was born ?
we said it was a mere formality , but it isn' t .
giulia ... will you marry me ?
did you hear ?
i want to marry you .
giulia , please .
i want you to marry me .
i' m asking for your hand !
giulia , please !
look , i don' t want you to come here anymore ...
... and don' t bring sara here .
i' il call her now .
i can' t see her .

i won this medal in a swimming race in 1964 .
take it , so you' il have one too now .
are you kidding me ?
i wanted my own medal .
i was supposed to win .
i always beat that girl before .
come on , eat your food .
tomorrow i' m going to milan .
will you go to sleep at alessia' s ?
what are you going there for ?
a psychiatric examination to a prison inmate .
who' s that ?
the manager of a public enterprise .
the defence asked for his release for health' s problems .
he said he' s going crazy inside there .
first they steal then they cry .
how do you know ?
i think he deserved it .
he should have thought twice before .
why are you so mad at him ?
because i hate those who make others pay for their own mistakes .
why don' t you ask me what i' m thinking of ?
because i always know when you' re thinking about your mother .
the others had no children , they were free .
she wasn' t !
she knows that and she feels guilty .
that' s good !
she didn' t kill anyone .
only because you stopped her in time .
she doesn' t want to see me , or she can' t ...
that' s fine , but what about you ?
you write and she doesn' t answer , you go there and she doesn' t want to see you .
this makes me angry !
and what should i do ?
find another woman !
my friends are crazy for you .
don' t you like alessia , for example ?
come on !
well you' re quite old after all , you gained weight too ...
you should be careful .
you' re still in love with her .
i' m not .
you are , i read the last letter you sent her .
you shouldn' t have .
i didn' t do it on purpose , it was on the table .
but you still love her , and i don' t want you to .
i would like to be able to take my own decisions .
you' re right , sorry .
tell me , was that a fight ?
no , you and i cannot fight .
why ?
because i love you too much .
you don' t say it often .
i don' t say many other things .
like ?
i want to go to rome and become a restorer .
i' il live with francesca and carlo .
you should ask them , before .
i already have .
will you be sad if i go there ?
yes .
i know , but i' il leave all the same .
idiot .
you cannot speak or you don' t want to ?
the court asked me to examine you and your lawyer agrees .
do you agree too ?
just say " yes " or " no " .
i know you have a daughter .
i have one too .
when one is in prison they feel like their children are ashamed of them .
but our children are stronger than us .
they' re too full of life and curiosity ... to get depressed because of their fathers ' misfortunes ... or their mothers ' .
are you here to check if i' m crazy ?
you lawyer would love that .
my wife and daughter don' t know the truth .
i found out myself yesterday .
you didn' t know you were doing illegal things ?
you work in a hospital ... ... hospitals are paid commissions too , it' s normal .
yet you never noticed anything , did you ?
maybe you suspected it , but pretended not to see , as millions of italians do .
then , one day a judge arrives and says that commissions are bribes , and that political parties can' t be financed secretly and that i am a thief .
wow ...
now prisons aren' t only full of unlucky apple thieves .
now justice is done !
but they forget they queued to give us money ... ... in change for favours and contracts .
now they play the part of those who wanna change the world .
doctor , nothing' s actually happening .
they arrested a bunch of idiots like me who were caught stealing , while all the others keep stealing undisturbed .
i didn' t make italy .
well , you didn' t as well , our fathers made this italy here .
my father didn' t .
believe me .
i' m sure your father was an honest man , and you like to feel honest too , don' t you ?
excuse me , can i have your catalogue ?
of course .
here you are .
thanks .
are the photos for sale ?
almost all of them .
almost " ?
yes , the one in the poster isn' t , for example .
where was he ?
what was he doing ?
did you ask them ?
no , those who took the picture weren' t there .
here' s her name .
" mirella utano " .
maybe they were for her .
what ?
his eyes , maybe they were for her .
who is she ?
when did she meet matteo ?
what does she know about him ?
i don' t know .
maybe he saw him in the street and took his picture .
no .
she spoke to him .
you can keep the book .
thanks .
but i want you to go and meet her .
who ?
mirella .
i want you to talk to her .
why should i ?
because i' m asking you .
i just do what' s right , and this isn' t .
did you get offended ?
maybe you do everything i ask you ?
i' ve asked you to get out of here for a long time but you don' t .
i asked you to go and live with elda and gino .
did you do it ?
i' m fine here .
no , you only think you are , but you aren' t .
you have to go out to understand that .
we' re discharging everyone but you .
you aren' t a good man .
you aren' t even skilled .
you used to be , now you aren' t .
you were a good man , now you aren' t .
the famous european law to abolish customs wasn' t understood by us italians .
" people ... " " won' t be able to pay taxes .
it' s not that they don' t want to ...
they already paid too many !
where' s the police station please ?
turn right at the end of the corridor .
where did you want to go ?
to the woman who took the picture .
why ?
to speak with her .
i spoke to the police , everything' s settled .
we can leave .

but i won' t take you back to the institute .
nicola , please ...
i can' t .
you can , instead .
no .

you took marcello' s jacket .
he' s still wondering where it is ...
you took a streetcar and came here all alone .
i won' t take you back there .
that' s the house .
are the others awake ?
i think so .
a bus will take a few of them to work in a while .
do you think i can make it ?
you' ve already made it .
thank you then .
don' t thank me .
matteo made you leave the hospital .
he gave us this present .
will you come to see me often ?
not too often , but i will .
smile , this is an important day .
aren' t you happy ?

you must tell them the lord will punish them ... " " ... and they' il burn in hell !
" let' s hope for them to change .
you must tell them !
you said they' il change too , they' il repent ... " " ... then they' il be forgiven .
i haven' t lost my hope , father .
people outside can see the coffins now .
they' re all pressing to pay tribute to them ...
... to giovanni falcone , francesca morvillo ... " " ... antonio montinaro , vito schifani , and rocco di cillo .

we shall never ask kindly for our rights to be respected !
we shall fight against the mafia !
we shall remember giovanni falcone !
we shall remember all the victims of the mafia !
we shall remember them as our siblings !
we shall love them like our siblings !
we shall defend that love being a good example for others !
sorry to make you wait , but i must develop them now .
we' il speak when i' m done .
won' t you get bored ?
thanks .
i took that picture here .
right in this place .
it was different ...
the towels were orange .
how long had you met him ?
five minutes .
he said his name was nicola .
he never told me his real name ,
i found out by myself .
i found out on the day ... ... when ...
i left the morning after , i went back home .
i needed to stay all alone for a while .
so you met him again in rome ?
yes .
a few hours before he ...
sorry .
it' s too hard ..
for me too .
i still can' t speak about him with anyone .
i' m sorry .
i' m about to leave .
how can you live on an island and be a reporter ?
i only work as much as i need .
when i' m needed , as when important things happen , like today .
are you going to turin ?
yes , returning home to my daughter .
do you have a daughter ?
yes , sara .
she' s 18 .
she wants to be a restorer .
she' s a grown up !
yes , she is !
do you have children ?
yes , one .
he' s about 8 and will be in the third grade this year .
his name' s andrea and he' s as handsome as matteo .
hello , can i help you ?
thanks , sir .
don' t bother ...
" sir " ?
nicola !
mom , you look like a poor oldie !
because i am !
what' s this darkness ?
i can' t stand the light .
it looks like a catacomb here .
giovanna used to draw the curtains .
i' il do it .
let the light in .
don' t make such a row .
it' s a beautiful day .
please don' t .
look at the sun .
mom i have something beautiful to tell you .
something about matteo .
one of those unpredictable things he used to do .
when he was in palermo he met a woman , mirella , and they had an affair .
an affair ?
yes , a love affair .
mirella had a baby , he was born after matteo left us .
his name' s andrea .
he' d love to meet his granny .
a baby ?
yes mom .
we' il catch the train to naples and then the ferryboat to sicily .
we' il be there tomorrow morning .
wait a minute .
what' s wrong mom ?
want some water ?
i can' t ...
i' m not ready .
what does that mean ?
how do you know it' s true ?
it is .
i met the child .
why didn' t she tell us before ?
why didn' t she write ?
why do you always have problems when something good happens ?
let' s leave , mom .
i can' t .
come on !
sara wants to move to carlo and francesca' s place .
i know , we spoke about it .
everybody knew it but me !
are you disappointed ?
no .
sara needs to live in a house where a mother is .
francesca is a good mother .
thanks honey .
for what ?
for never being jealous of your siblings .
in fact i was jealous of someone else .
of whom ?
your students .
my students ?
yes .
you took them to see museums and to our house , and checked their homework ...
i thought you loved them more than us .
they lacked real families .
no one paid attention to them , their parents never spoke to them .
and so you did that ...
yes , but maybe i should have spoken with you more .
come on mom , cheer up !
don' t speak milanese , you' re so bad at it ...
how did you get used to rome ?
it was love at first sight .
it looks so decayed and ruined ...
rotten and mephitic ...
and its inhabitants seem cynical and impolite , but they' re just full of irony .
do you know where i met your dad ?
no .
in campo de ' fiori , at the market .
he was a costermonger .
he bought fruit and greens in naples .
you know , one of his deals .
on his cart there was a notice saying " spanish oranges " .
so i asked him if they were really spanish .
miss , can' t you hear the castanets ?
and what did you do ?
i bought the oranges and married him !
andrea , they' re here .
hi .
" hi " and ?
hi granny .
hi !
granny said " hi " .
if you cry i' il hit you !
i think they like each other .
so do i.
by the way i wanted to thank you .
for what ?
for letting us come .
i did nothing special .
you could have said " no " .
come on ...
where' s your school ?
over there .
will you attend middle school there too ?
no , in lipari .
where' s lipari ?
there , but there' s no volcano .
are you scared of volcanoes ?
no .
what scares you ?
nothing .
you' re lucky .
i' m afraid of many things .
for example i was afraid of coming here .
did the sea scare you ?
yes .
why ?
you can' t swim ?
no .
it' s easy .
i can teach you .
he spoke about faith , which never abandoned him ... " " not even when he was on the verge of desperation .
of faith , which comes from the knowledge of men and things .
he spoke a long time , as if he were speaking to himself ... " " ... about his own courage and energy under any circumstances .
go ahead !
his thoughts were so clear that he never even changed his tone of voice .
these are pictures of matteo .
i haven' t been able to look at them since ...
i tried , sometimes .
my hands started shaking .
i want you to have them .
one day andrea could be curious to know what his father looked like when he was a child .
shall we look at them together ?
bye .
thanks for everything .
see you soon .
let' s go mom .
okay .
i' il miss your eyes .
if you cry i' il hit you !
i' il hit you , you' re annoying !

there' s a lot of room here , and i' d love it .
andrea would as well , wouldn' t you ?

yes , stay .
i don' t have suitable clothes ...
you can buy some .
and i' il have francesca send you what you need .
should i stay then ?
of course .
mom , can' t you hear the castanets ?
granny , can' t you hear the castanets ?
the accelerator is on the right !
there are so many hats , what should i do with them ?
alright , i' il keep them .
no , i didn' t pack the flowered dress .
because ...
wait a minute .
you tell her .
thanks .
hello ?
yes granny .
i' m learning the roman dialect !
how are you ?
listen granny , as regards the flowered dress ...
do you really need it ?
you know , it' s back in fashion ...
you' il look like an oldie wearing it .
viper !
why do you want to look older ?
it' s perfect on me , instead .
francesca says it too .
it' s true , mom .
she looks ...
remember that picture of you and dad in capri ?
are you ready ?
yes .
do i really look good ?
you look great !
i should wear high heels too , but i can' t walk in them .

so , i need two or three good ideas here .
which ideas ?
look at those cracks !
it needs new foundations .
there are cracks in the frame !
that' s why i called you , micavi enterprises !

i want sloping red bricks here .

you' re always complaining !
why ?
you' re rich now !
you' re the owner !
i' m rich in debts !
owners always complain .

aluminium window frames ?
here i want the kitchen .
look at this wonder !
francesca wants it big .
look at that fireplace .
simply great !
here i want a bathroom .
here will be the nursery .
every room must have a bath .
i count on that .
here i want another studio , or even ...
i don' t know .
we' il think about it .
my only problem is i don' t know what to do with these pools .
shall i keep them ?
they aren' t important .
but the floors need loose stone foundations .
i want hand made terracotta tiles for the floors .
do you know how much it' il cost you ?
he wants it hand made !

micavi ...
i' m asking you officially .
micavi enterprises ...

he already speaks like a owner .
there' s a boy who likes sara ...
i know , francesca told me .

you don' t have to stop his gestures , or he' il think they make no sense , while they make sense to him .
i' il try , even if that seems impossible to me .
nothing is impossible .
i don' t know what else i could do .
try to understand that sense .
that' s all .
but it' s like decrypting hieroglyphics !
in fact we did that little by little .
let' s have the usual meeting .
can you call the others ?
shall we wait for you inside ?
no , under that tree .
okay kids .
you have to guess the animals .
my assistant giacomo will mime .
it' s not easy ...
it' s a particular animal .
giacomo is a great mime .
it' s a lizard !
it isn' t a lizard , it crawls .
it' s a cobra !
no .
it' s long !
so it' s a cobra !
it crawls but it' s not a cobra .
it' s a snail !
no .
it isn' t poisonous .
let' s say it has rings .
a worm !
no , it has rings so it' s a ?
ring snake !

giacomo is very good .
after becoming popular in munich , paris and london , our giacomo will perform as a mime again now .

that' s true .
i' il bring him here , i promise .
how was he ?
he ?
he was like achilles .
did granny tell you about achilles ?
yes .
he was as brave and sad as him .
he knew the gods would take him .
you know how the gods are .
they send their favourite ones here , then take them back .
but before that , they make them leave a trace , so we can' t forget them .
that trace is you .
this morning when you were checking the atlas , you looked like him when he was your age .
we checked an atlas too a long time ago .
we wanted to have a journey .
we wanted to go to a far away place where there' s only the sea .
that place' s name is cape north .
where is it ?
over there .
did you reach it ?
i tried but i couldn' t .
your father wanted to , but in the end he didn' t .
the gods were calling him .
yes , they were .
why don' t you stay a few more days ?
i can' t , i have to leave tonight .
i need to check up the kids tomorrow .

we had to insist !
look at that orchard !

yes , there are palm trees too .
he put them in front of the house .
but they' re still small .
you got rich with this project .

you never get rich with your friends ' money .
i meant rich inside .

giving without receiving ...
they' re making me crazy .
your sister is worse than him .

i don' t want to bother anyone with my presence .
i received it two days ago .

everything' s really beautiful !
