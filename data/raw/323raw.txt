police have announced the name ofthe victim in the second oftwo murders which took place today .
lncredibly , the names ofthe two victims are virtually identical .
two hours ago , 35 year old sarah ann connor was pronounced dead ...
can we change this ?
sarah louise ...
don' t touch it .
police are refusing to speculate on the similarity between the shooting deaths and no other connection between the two victims has been established yet .
we' il have more on this late breaking story as it comes in .

this is one l 19 .
i got a hit and run felony .
suspect vehicle late model grey ford headed westbound on seven .
he' s really moving punching lights .
i' m gonna need an ambulance at seventh and broadway right now .
hold it .
hold on .
are you injured ?
are you shot ?
do exactly what i say .
exactly .
don' t move unless i say .
don' t make a sound unless i say .
do you understand ?
do you understand ?
yes .
please don' t hurt me .
i' m here to help you .
i' m reese .
sergeant tech com .
dn38416 .
assigned to protect you .
you' ve been targeted for termination .
this is one l 19 .
westbound on olympic .
approaching overland .
this is a mistake .
i didn' t do anything .
no , but you will .
it' s very important that you live .
this isn' t true .
how could that man just get up after you ...
it' s not a man .
a machine .
a terminator .
cyberdyne systems model 101 .
a machine ?
like a robot ?
not a robot .
a cyborg cybernetic organism .
no .
he was bleeding .
just a second .
get your head down .
listen .
the terminator' s an infiltration unit .
part man , part machine .
underneath it' s a hyper alloy combat chassis .
microprocessor controlled .
fully armoured , very tough .
outside it' s living human tissue .
flesh , skin , hair , blood grown for the cyborgs .
look , reese , i don' t know ...
pay attention .
i gotta ditch this car .
the 600 series had rubber skin .
we spotted them easy .
but these are new .
they look human .
sweat , bad breath , everything .
very hard to spot .
i had to wait till he moved on you before i could zero him .
look , i am not stupid .
they cannot make things like that yet .
not yet .
not for about forty years .
are you saying it' s from the future ?
one possible future ... from your point of view .
i don' t know tech stuff .
then you' re from the future , too .
ls that right ?
right .
right .
cyborgs don' t feel pain .
i do .
don' t do that again .
just let me go .
listen and understand .
that terminator is out there .
it can' t be bargained with , it can' t be reasoned with .
it doesn' t feel pity or remorse or fear and it absolutely will not stop , ever , until you are dead .
can you stop it ?
i don' t know .
with these weapons , i don' t know .
all units .
ford suspect vehicle has been found in a parking structure ...
reese , why me ?
why does it want me ?
there was a nuclear war .
a few years from now , all this , this whole place , everything , it' s gone , just gone .
there were survivors .
here , there .
nobody even knew who started it .
it was the machines , sarah .
i don' t understand .
defence network computers .
new , powerful , hooked into everything , trusted to run it all .
they say it got smart a new order of intelligence .
then it saw all people as a threat .
not just the ones on the other side .
it decided our fate in a microsecond .
extermination .
did you see this war ?
no .
i grew up after . ln the ruins .
starving .
hiding from the h ks .
h ks ?
hunter killers .
patrol machines built in automated factories .
most of us were rounded up .
put in camps for orderly disposal .
this was burned in by laser scanner .
some of us were kept alive .
to work .
loading bodies .
the disposal units ran night and day .
we were that close to going out for ever .
but there was one man who taught us to fight .
to storm the wire of the camps .
to smash those metal motherfuckers into junk .
he turned it around .
he brought us back from the brink .
his name was connor .
john connor .
your son , sarah .
your unborn son .
drive .
reese !
no , reese .
no , no , no .
they' il kill you .
you in the cadillac , let me see your hands now .
get out of the car .
drop to your knees .
out of the car .
drop to the ground .
sarah .
sarah , try to drink some of this .
listen , are you sure it' s them ?
i mean , maybe i should look at the bodies .
no .
they' ve been identified and there' s no doubt .
ginger .
kiddo .
sarah , this is dr silberman .
hi , sarah .
tell him everything reese told you , sarah .
do you feel up to that ?
yeah , i guess so .
you' re a doctor ?
criminal psychologist .
ls reese crazy ?
that' s what we' re gonna find out .
so you' re a soldier .
fighting for whom ?
with the 1 32nd under perry .
from ' 21 to ' 27 .
that' s the year 2027 ?
that' s right .
then i was assigned ...
this is fucking great . .. under john connor .
who was the enemy ?
a computer defence system ...
goddamn !
sorry . .. built for sac norad by cyberdyne systems .
i see .
and this computer thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy .
killing him , in effect , before he' s even conceived .
a sort of retroactive abortion ?
silberman cracks me up .
last week , a guy burned his afghan .
he screwed it first ...
ed , shut up .
why didn' t the computer just kill connor then ?
why this elaborate scheme with the terminator ?
it had no choice .
their defence grid was smashed .
we' d won .
taking out connor then would make no difference .
skynet had to wipe out his entire existence .
ls that when you captured the lab complex and found ...
what is it called ?
the time displacement equipment ?
that' s right .
the terminator had already gone through .
connor sent me to intercept and they blew the whole place .
well , how are you supposed to get back ?
i can' t .
nobody goes home .
nobody else comes through .
it' s just him and me .
it' s just him and me .
why didn' t you bring any weapons ?
something more advanced .
don' t you have ray guns ?
ray guns .
show me a piece of future technology .
you go naked .
something about the field generated by a living organism .
nothing dead will go .
i didn' t build the fucking thing .
ok , ok .
but this cyborg , ifit' s metal ... ?
surrounded by living tissue .
oh , right .
great stuff .
i could make a career out of this guy .
see how clever it is ?
it doesn' t require a shred of proof .
most paranoid delusions are intricate , but this is brilliant .
why were the other women killed ?
records were lost in the war .
skynet knew almost nothing about connor' s mother .
her full name , where she lived .
theyjust knew the city .
the terminator was just being systematic .
let' s go back ...
look , you have heard enough .
i have answered your questions .
i have to see sarah connor .
i' m afraid that' s not up to me .
then why am i talking to you ?
who is in authority here ?
please ...
shut up !
you still don' t get it , do you ?
he' il find her .
that' s what he does .
that' s all he does .
you can' t stop him .
he' il reach down her throat and pull her fucking heart out !
doc .
let go ofme !
sorry .
he' s crazy ?
ln technical terminology , he' s a loon .
sarah , this is what they call body armour .
our tac guys wear these .
it' il stop a 1 2 gauge round .
this other man must' ve been wearing one under his coat .
feel that .
he punched through the windshield .
he was probably on pcp .
broke every bone in his hand .
he wouldn' t feel it .
there was this guy once ...
you see this scar ?
thank you .
there' s a couch in this other room .
stretch out and get some sleep .
be at least an hour before your mother gets here .
i can' t sleep .
try .
it may not look it , but that couch is very comfortable .
you' il be perfectly safe .
we got 30 cops in this building .
thank you .
good night .
good night .
i' m a friend of sarah connor .
i was told she' s here .
could i see her ?
no .
can' t see her .
she' s making a statement .
where is she ?
it make take a while . lf you wanna wait , there' s a bench over there .
i' il be back .
stay here .
watch him .
ed ...
sarah !
reese .
this way .
kflb news time .
4 . 36 .
top story the largest single law enforcement mobilisation in california history is currently underway .
police in five counties are engaged in a massive manhunt for ...
take this .
all right .
let' s get this off the road .
you cold ?
freezing .
reese ?
you got a first name ?
kyle .
kyle , what' s it like when you go through time ?
white light .
pain .
it' s like being born maybe .
my god .
i caught one back there .
you mean you got shot ?
it' s not bad .
we gotta get you to a doctor .
it' s ok .
forget it .
what do you mean , forget it ?
are you crazy ?
take this off .
jesus .
see ?
it passed right through the meat .
this is gonna make me puke .
would you just talk about something ?
what ?
i don' t know .
anything .
just talk .
tell me about my son .
he' s about my height .
he has your eyes .
what' s he like ?
you trust him .
he' s got a strength .
i' d die for john connor .
well , at least now i know what to name him .
don' t suppose you know who the father is so i won' t tell him to get lost ?
john never said much about him .
i know he dies before the war ...
wait .
i don' t wanna know .
so was it john that sent you here ?
i volunteered .
why ?
it was a chance to meet the legend .
sarah connor , who taught her son to fight , organise , prepare from when he was a kid .
when you were in hiding before the war .
you' re talking about things i haven' t done yet in the past tense .
it' s driving me crazy .
are you sure you have the right person ?
i' m sure .
come on !
do i look like the mother of the future ?
i mean , am i tough ?
organised ?
i can' t even balance my chequebook .
look , reese , i didn' t ask for this honour and i don' t want it .
any of it .
your son gave me a message to give to you .
made me memorise it .
thank you , sarah , for your courage through the dark years .
i can' t help you with what you must soon face .
the future is not set .
you must be stronger than you imagine you can be .
you must survive or i will never exist .
that' s all .
it' s a good field dressing .
you like it ?
it' s my first .
get some sleep .
it' il be light soon .
ok .
talk to me some more .
about what ?
tell me about where you' re from .
all right .
you stay down by day , but at night you can move around .
you still have to be careful because the h ks use infrared .
but they' re not too bright .
john taught us ways to dust them .
that' s when the infiltrators started to appear .
the terminators were the newest .
the worst .
traversing your sector in search mode .
750 metres north ofyour position .
let' s go .
reese .
dn384 ...
right .
let him in .
terminator !
i was dreaming about dogs .
we use ' em to spot terminators .
your world is pretty terrifying .
hey , buddy , you got a dead cat in there or what ?
fuck you , asshole .
god damn .
thank you .
ls this enough ?
yeah , it' s enough .
i don' t wanna ask where you got it .
i' m coming .
we need a room .
with a kitchen .
do you have one with a kitchen ?
i am dying for a shower .
we should check your bandage , too .
later .
i' m going out for supplies .
keep this .
no , i can' t tell you where i am , mom .
i was told not to say .
i need to know where to reach you .
you tell me to hide out at the cabin and you won' t tell me what' s going on ?
i am worried sick here .
ok .
ok , here' s the number .
you ready ?
yes .
go ahead .
it' s 408 555 1439 .
room nine .
got it ?
i' ve got it .
i gotta go .
i' m sorry i can' t tell you more right now .
i love you , mom .
i love you , too , sweetheart .
tiki motel .
give me your address there .
what have we got ?
mothballs ... corn syrup ... ammonia .
what' s for dinner ?
plastique .
that sounds good .
what is it ?
it' s a nitroglycerin base .
it' s a bit more stable .
i learned to make it when i was a kid .
make sure there' s none on the threads .
like this .
screw the end cap on .
very gently .
you must' ve had a fun childhood .
that' s good .
all right .
six more like that and i' il get started on the fuses .
he' il find us , won' t he ?
probably .
it' il never be over , will it ?
look at me .
i' m shaking .
some legend .
you must be pretty disappointed .
no , i' m not .
kyle , the women in your time , what are they like ?
good fighters .
that' s not what i meant .
was there someone special ?
someone ... ?
a girl , you know .
no .
never .
never ?
i' m sorry .
i' m so sorry .
so much pain .
pain can be controlled .
you just disconnect it .
so you feel nothing ?
john connor gave me a picture of you once .
i didn' t know why at the time .
it was very old , torn , faded .
you were young like you are now .
you seemed just a little sad .
i used to always wonder what you were thinking at that moment .
i memorised every line , every curve .
i came across time for you , sarah .
i love you .
i always have .
i shouldn' t have said that .
think fast .
trade places .
faster .
drive faster .
kyle .
oh , my god .
you stay here .
let' s get outta here .
get out .
kyle .
come on .
get up .
come on .
help me .
get out .
get out .
don' t stop .
run .
sarah .
kyle .
we did it , kyle .
we got him .
no .
wait .
what are you doing ?
cover , so he can' t track us .
come on .
no .
kyle .
come on .
come on .
leave me here .
move it , reese .
on your feet , soldier .
on your feet .
move it .

go back .
run , sarah .

kyle .
seven .
november 10 .
where was l ?
what' s difficult is trying to decide what to tell you and what not to .
but i guess i have a while before you' re old enough to understand these tapes .
they' re more for me at this point just so that i can get it straight .
fill her up .
should i tell you about your father ?
boy , that' s a tough one .
will it effect your decision to send him here , knowing that he is your father ?
lf you don' t send kyle , you can never be .
god , a person could go crazy thinking about this .
i suppose i will tell you .
i owe him that .
maybe it' il help if ... you know that in the few hours that we had together , we loved a lifetime' s worth .
what did he just say ?
he says you' re very beautiful .
he is ashamed to ask you for five dollars for this picture .
but if he doesn' t , his father will beat him .
pretty good hustle , kid .
what did he just say ?
he said there' s a storm coming in .
i know .
