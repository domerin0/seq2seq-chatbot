you start out with a little bit of oil .
then you fry some garlic .
then you throw in some tomatoes , some tomato paste .
you fry it .
you make sure it doesn' t stick .
when you got it to a boil , shove in all your sausage and meatballs .
and a little bit of wine .
and a little bit of sugar .
and that' s my trick .

i don' t know .
what are you doing here ?
you' re not supposed to be here now .

there' s nobody here .
what happened to the guards ?
your father just had too many visitors .
they interfered with hospital service .
the police made them leave about ten minutes ago .

nurse , wait a minute .

sonny , michael .

pop is all alone .

we' il send somebody .
i won' t panic .
i' m sorry , but you will have to leave .
you and i are gonna move my father to another room .
can you disconnect those tubes so we can move the bed out ?
that' s out of the question .
do you know my father ?
men are coming here to kill him .
you understand ?
now , help me , please .
who are you ?
i am enzo the baker .
you remember me ?
enzo ?
yes , enzo .
you better get out of here , enzo .
there' s gonna be trouble .

for your father .
all right , listen .
wait for me outside , in front of the hospital .

just lie here , pop .
i' il take care of you now .
i' m with you now .
i' m with you .

come here .
put your hand in your pocket like you have a gun .
you' il be all right .
you' il be okay .
you did good .
here he is .
all right , hold still .
i thought i got all you guinea hoods locked up .
what are you doing here ?
what happened to the men who were guarding my father , captain ?
why , you little punk .
what the hell are you doing , telling me my business ?
i pulled them guys off of here .
you get out of here and stay away from this hospital .
i' m not moving until you put some guards around my father' s room .
phil , take him in .
the kid' s clean , captain .
he' s a war hero .
he' s never been busted  goddamn it , i said take him in .
what' s the turk paying you to set up my father , captain ?
take ahold of him .
stand him up .
stand him up straight .
i' m the attorney for the corleone family .
these men are private detectives hired to protect vito corleone .
they' re licensed to carry firearms .
if you interfere , you' il have to appear before a judge ... in the morning and show cause .
all right , let him go .
come on .
what' s with all the new faces ?
gonna need ' em now .
after the hospital thing , sonny got mad .
we hit bruno tattaglia at 4 : 00 this morning .
jesus christ .
looks like a fortress around here .
a hundred button men on the street , 24 hours a day .
that turk shows one hair on his ass , he' s dead .
believe me .
hey , michael , come here .
let me look at you .
you look beautiful .
just beautiful .
you' re gorgeous .
hey , listen to this .
the turk , he wants to talk .
imagine the nerve on this son of a bitch .
craps out last night , he wants a meeting today .
what' d he say ?
what did he say ?
he wants us to send michael to hear the proposition .
and the promise is that the deal is so good that we can' t refuse .
what about bruno tattaglia ?
that' s part of the deal .
bruno cancels out what they did to my father .
sonny , we ought to hear what they have to say .
no more .
not this time , consigliere .
no more meetings , no discussions , no more sollozzo tricks .
you give them one message i want sollozzo .
if not , it' s all out war .
we go to the mattresses .
some of the other families won' t sit still for a war .
then they hand me sollozzo .
your father wouldn' t like this .
this is business , not personal .
they shot my father .
even shooting your father was business , not personal , sonny .
well , then business will have to suffer .
and do me a favor , tom
no more advice on how to patch things up .
just help me win , please .
all right ?
i found out about this mccluskey who broke mike' s jaw .
what about him ?
he' s definitely on sollozzo' s payroll , and for big money .
mccluskey has agreed to be the turk' s bodyguard .
what you have to understand , sonny ... is that while sollozzo' s being guarded like this ... he is invulnerable .
nobody has ever gunned down a new york police captain .
never .
it would be disastrous .
all the five families would come after you .
the corleone family would be outcast .
even the old man' s political protection would run for cover .
so do me a favor .
take this into consideration .
all right , we' il wait .
we can' t wait .
can' t wait .
i don' t care what sollozzo says about a deal .
he' s gonna kill pop .
that' s it .
that' s the key for him .
got to get sollozzo .
mike is right .
let me ask you something first .
what about this mccluskey ?
what do we do with this cop ?
they want to have a meeting with me , right ?
it will be me ...
mccluskey and sollozzo .
let' s set the meeting .
get our informers to find out where it' s going to be held .
we insist it' s a public place a bar , a restaurant .
someplace where there' s people , so i feel safe .
they' re gonna search me when i first meet them , right ?
so i can' t have a weapon on me then .
but if clemenza can figure a way ... to have a weapon planted there for me ...
then i' il kill them both .
what are you gonna do ?
nice college boy , huh ?
didn' t want to get mixed up in the family business .
now you want to gun down a police captain ?
why ?
' cause he slapped you in the face a little bit ?
do you think this is the army , where you shoot them a mile away ?
you gotta get up close , like this and
you blow their brains all over your nice ivy league suit .
come here .
you' re taking this very personal .
tom , this is business , and this man is taking it very , very personal .
where does it say you can' t kill a cop ?
come on , mikey .
tom , wait a minute .
i' m talking about a cop that' s mixed up in drugs .
i' m talking about a dishonest cop , a crooked cop ... who got mixed up in the rackets and got what was coming to him .
that' s a terrific story .
we have newspaper people on the payroll , don' t we , tom ?
they might like a story like that .
they might .
they just might .
it' s not personal , sonny .
it' s strictly business .
it' s as cold as they come .
impossible to trace , so you don' t worry about prints , mike .
i put a special tape on the trigger and the butt .
here .
try it .
what' s the matter , the trigger too tight ?
my ears .
i left it noisy .
that way it scares pain in the ass innocent bystanders away .
all right , you shot them both .
now what do you do ?
sit down , finish my dinner .
come on , kid .
don' t fool around .
just let your hand drop to your side and let the gun slip out .
everybody will still think you got it .
they' re gonna be staring at your face , mike ... so walk out of the place real fast , but you don' t run .
don' t look nobody directly in the eye , but don' t look away , either .
they' re gonna be scared stiff of you , believe me ... so don' t worry about nothing .
you know , you' re gonna turn out all right .
you take a long vacation , nobody knows where ... and we' re gonna catch the hell .
how bad do you think it' s gonna be ?
pretty goddamn bad .
probably all the other families will line up against us .
that' s all right .
these things gotta happen every five years or so .
ten years .
helps to get rid of the bad blood .
been ten years since the last one .
you gotta stop them at the beginning ...
like they should have stopped hitler at munich .
they should have never let him get away with that .
they was just asking for big trouble .
you know , mike , we was all proud of you ... being a hero and all .
your father too .
nothing .
not a hint .
absolutely nothing .
even sollozzo' s people don' t know where the meeting will be held .
how much time do we have ?
gonna pick you up in front of jack dempsey' s joint ... in an hour and a half exactly an hour and a half .
we could put a tail on them , see how it turns out .
sollozzo' il lose our ass going around the block .
what about the negotiator ?
he' s over at my place playing pinochle with a couple of my men .
he' s happy .
they' re letting him win .
it' s too much of a risk for mike .
maybe we ought to call it off .
the negotiator keeps playing cards until mike' s back safe and sound .
why doesn' t he blast who' s ever in the goddamn car ?
too dangerous .
they' il be looking for that .
sollozzo might not even be in the car , sonny .
i got it .
yeah .
louis restaurant in the bronx .
is it reliable ?
that' s my man in mccluskey' s precinct .
a police captain' s got to be on call 24 hours a day .
he signed out at that number between 8 : 00 and 1 0 : 00 .
anybody know this joint ?
yeah , sure .
i do .
it' s perfect for us .
a small family place , good food .
everyone minds his business .
it' s perfect .
pete , they got an old fashioned toilet
you know , the box and the chain thing .
we might be able to tape the gun behind it .
all right .
mike , you go to the restaurant .
you eat , you talk for a while , you relax .
you make them relax .
then you get up and go take a leak .
no , better still , you ask for permission to go .
and when you come back , you come out blasting .
and don' t take any chances .
two shots in the head apiece .
now , listen .
i want somebody good and i mean very good to plant that gun .
i don' t want him coming out with just his dick in his hands .
the gun will be there .
all right , listen .
you drive him and you pick him up after the job .
come on .
let' s move .
thank you , tom .
did he tell you to drop the gun right away ?
yeah , a million times .
don' t forget two shots apiece in the head ... as soon as you come out the door .
let' s go .
how long do you think it' il be before i can come back ?
at least a year , mike .
listen , i' il square with mom you not seeing her before you leave ... and i' il get a message to that girlfriend ... when i think the time is right .
take care .
see you , mike .
okay , tom .
i' m glad you came , mike .
i hope we can straighten everything out .
this is terrible .
it' s not the way i wanted things to go at all .
it should have never happened .
i want to straighten everything out tonight .
i don' t want my father bothered anymore .
he won' t be , mike .
i swear on my children he won' t be .
but you got to keep an open mind when we talk .
i hope you' re not a hothead like your brother sonny .
you can' t talk business with him .
he' s a good kid .
i' m sorry about the other night , mike .
i gotta frisk you , so turn around , huh ?
on your knees , facing me .
i guess i' m getting too old for my job .
too grouchy .
can' t stand the aggravation .
you know how it is .
he' s clean .
we' re going to jersey ?
maybe .
nice work , lou .
how' s the italian food in this restaurant ?
good .
try the veal .
it' s the best in the city .
i' il have it .
i' m gonna speak italian to mike .
go ahead .
what i want what' s most important to me is that i have a guarantee : no more attempts on my father' s life .
what guarantees could i give you ?
i am the hunted one .
i missed my chance .
you think too much of me , kid .
i' m not that clever .
all i want is a truce .
i have to go to the bathroom .
is that all right ?
you gotta go , you gotta go .
i frisked him .
he' s clean .
don' t take too long .
i' ve frisked a thousand young punks .
hey , come on .
come on .
let' s go .
joe , you take over .
hi , grandpa .
i love you , grandpa .
i' m sorry , pa .
he doesn' t know you yet .
here you are , big guy .
give it to grandpa .
i hope you get well , grandpa ... and i wish i would see you soon .
love , your grandson , frank .
go with your mother .
go ahead .
take ' em downstairs .
go on , carlo .
you too .
go on .
i got chicken cacciatore for you , sweetheart .
that' s enough bread .
i love bread .
but how much can you eat ?
what' s the matter with you , carlo ?
shut up and set the table .
since mccluskey' s killing ... the police have been cracking down on most of our operations .
and also the other families ' .
been a lot of bad blood .
they hit us , so we hit them back .
through our contacts in the newspapers ... we' ve been able to put out a lot of material ... about mccluskey being linked with sollozzo in the drug rackets .
see , things are starting to loosen up .
dad , i' m sending fredo to las vegas ... under the protection of don francesco of l. a.
i want him to rest .
i' m going to learn the casino business .
yeah .
where is michael ?
it was michael who killed sollozzo .
but he' s safe .
we' re starting to work to bring him back now .
i want you to find out where that little pimp tattaglia is hiding .
i want his ass now right now .
hey , sonny .
what ?
things are starting to loosen up a little bit .
if you go after tattaglia , all hell' s going to break loose .
let the smoke clear .
pop can negotiate .
no , pop can' t do nothing till he' s better .
i' m gonna decide
all right , but your war' s costing us a lot of money .
nothing' s coming in .
we can' t do business .
neither can they .
don' t worry about it .
we can' t afford a stalemate .
then there ain' t no more stalemate .
i' m gonna end it by killing that old bastard .
you' re getting a great reputation .
i hope you' re enjoying it .
do what i tell you to do !
goddamn it , if i had a wartime consigliere a sicilian
i wouldn' t be in this shape !
pop had genco .
look what i got .
i' m sorry .
i didn' t mean that .
mom made a little dinner .
it' s sunday .
niggers are having a good time ... with our policy banks up there in harlem .
driving them new cadillacs , paying 50 % on a bet .
i knew that was gonna happen as soon as they started making big money .
papa never talked business at the table in front of the kids .
shut up , connie .
don' t you ever tell her to shut up .
you got that ?
santino , don' t interfere .
sonny , tom , i' d like to talk to you , maybe after dinner .
i could be doing more for the family .
we don' t discuss business at the table .
corleone .
hey , american !
take me to america !
g. i. !
take me to america , g. i. clark gable .
i apologize if i offended you .
i' m a stranger in this country ... and i meant no disrespect to you or your daughter .
i' m an american hiding in sicily .
my name is michael corleone .
there are people who would pay a lot of money for that information .
but then your daughter would lose a father ... instead of gaining a husband .
i want to meet your daughter ... with your permission ... and under the supervision of your family ... with all respect .
apollonia .
hey !
i' m gonna knock you dizzy .
save it for the library .
