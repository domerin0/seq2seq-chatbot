your food is still there , isn' t it ?

i am saving this for my mother
your mother has passed away
she will not need this anymore
but qingcheng must not die , she must go on living

any happiness they bring will be fleeting
are you willing to accept this ?
yes i am
once you have agreed this will become your destiny for life
it can never be changed
unless time flows backwards winter falls in the spring and the dead come back to life
remember , all the riches of the world will be yours in return for this promise ...
commander yeli , what was that noise ?
barbarians
barbarians ?
where ?
they are hiding from us
how many are they ?
twenty thousand
twenty thousand ?
twenty thousand against three thousand ?
you should say three thousand against twenty thousand
be proud to be one of the three thousand
our enemies are the ones to quake in terror as they are about to face our great general
how many slaves have you brought ?
132 !
great general
i' il take them all
for this price you can' t even buy dead bodies !
i am buying dead bodies
none of them will survive the battle
but commander you said ...
here are 1330 pieces of silver .
count it !
thank you for the extra 10
there is no extra , 132 slaves plus you is 133
tell them to stand up
sir , slaves do not know how to stand
they only know how to kneel or crawl
i shouldn' t really give you this piece of meat
i earned it , not you
the alarm !
where are we going ?
into the valley , to lure the enemy towards us
when they think they have destroyed our army
we shall ride down and attack
what is it ?
listen ...
run !
flee ?
they have bought our lives .
they' il kill us if we turn back !
remember , kunlun
i am still your master and you have to protect me with your life
yes , master
kunlun , up the hill !
shoot
these slaves have been ordered to deflect the first attack
don' t let them escape !
great general
those stupid barbarians don' t know this valley is shaped like a horseshoe !
that slave is overtaking them and guiding them straight back !
charge !
to the death !
do not look back !
keep going !
look , one of them is still alive !
it' s our bull !!
run !
long live the general !
long live the general !
victory !
victory !
he is long dead , why did you bother to carry him all this way ?
he was my master
what is your name ?
the slave kunlun
where are you from ?
i don' t know
family ?
no family
how long have you been a slave ?
for as long as i can remember
i want you to be my slave ?
i want that too
why ?
if i serve you , i get to eat every day
from now on i am your master
yes , master
from today
i don' t want you to kneel
i want you to run for me
the duke of the north , wuhuan , has invaded the imperial city
where is the king ?
he is trapped inside the palace
his majesty commands you to come to his rescue at once !
we shall go on ahead .
follow with the rest of the men
there' s that blasted tree again !
we are lost
let' s split up
whoever finds the way out will light a flare
yes , master
don' t be frightened
general guangming never kills the innocent
you lie
how did your slaves die ?
and you say you do not kill the innocent !
if you killed me , who is going to show you the way ?
who said i was going anywhere ?
it is best if you are not
it would have been a wasted journey
oh really ?
listen !
there is no battle i cannot win
nobody i cannot rescue
i heard about what happened at horseshoe valley 3, 000 men destroyed 20, 000 .
a handsome victory !
but without that slave , would you have had the same success ?
i am afraid you cannot win forever unless you accept a wager
if you win this
i shall grant you victory in every battle you shall ever fight
what is the wager ?
let us bet on the outcome of your race to save the king
then you have already lost
the moment i show my face at the imperial city that weakling wuhuan will submit without question
let me show you what will happen to the king and his princess qingcheng
would anyone like to know what i am wearing under this garment ?
you have shamed me , i shall kill you !
you ?
your majesty !
are you saying i am going to kill the king ?
the king will be killed by the master of the crimson armor
that is his destiny , which nobody can change
say you are right and i lose the bet ?
what will you want from me ?
a bitter tear shed because of your broken heart
hadn' t you better ask for something i possess ?
one day your heart will be shattered and bitter tears will be shed
remember
when you find love ... you will also find death
and if i rescue the king and win the bet ?
you won' t
the battle of horseshoe valley was your last success
by the way the road to the imperial city lies to the east
my master , the duke of the north , has commanded me to kill you .
he also requests your armor .
take it off !
master !
master !
i have found the way out !
what happened to you ?
who are you ?
give me the helmet
don' t give it to him !
you move fast
did you once live in the land of snow ?
i will not kill you
what lightning speed he had !
you saved my life and served me well
kunlun , i want you to go to the imperial city and rescue the king
wear my armor
as long as you keep silent nobody will dare block your way
how will i recognize the king ?
he will be the only one without a weapon
your majesty !
may i ask where princess qingcheng is ?
wuhuan , i thought you wanted my throne
but you only wanted my woman
need you have gone to such lengths ?
gathering an entire army ?
surrounding the imperial city ?
all you had to do was ask !
wuhuan , you underestimate me
did you think i would choose a woman over my throne ?
it is no wonder that compared to general guangming you are always second rate in the eyes of the people
don' t you have anything new to say ?
did i forget to tell you ?
the general is on his way and will be arriving any minute
someone told you guangming is coming ?
if he were about to arrive would i still be sitting here exchanging pleasantries with you ?
i sacrificed my cherished desire to kill your favorite general myself and sent the swiftest assassin in the world
were you hoping to be rescued ?
the people' s hero is a dead man as we speak !
let me through !
would anyone like to know what i am wearing underneath this garment ?
if so , put down your weapons
it' s working !
strip !
keep stripping !
would you like to know what is underneath this layer ?
if so , pick up your weapons again and aim them at that heartless man !
what are you all doing ?
you betray me ?
my rescuer comes !
my great general guangming is here !
you have shamed me , i shall kill you !
i shall kill you !
you ?
he has killed the king !
keep going !
general guangming
don' t think that because you saved my life
i shall be obliged to stay with you
from the moment the king turned against me
my mind was made up
i shall never again let a man possess me
i have had enough
if you take one more step i shall jump
you must not die , you must go on living
you must not die , you must go on living
great general , i do admire you
it took me a year' s planning to get to the princess
yet you managed to abduct her in a matter of minutes !
it never occurred to me to kill the king
but you did it without batting an eyelid
what imagination , great general !
the king' s favorite becomes his murderer !
you have always known how to reach for the stars
you are utterly ruthless
as long as you are alive
i can only be second best not just on the battlefield , but in the hearts of the people
what will they think of you now . the king' s assassin ?
here' s a proposal if you are willing to jump off the cliff
i shall let qingcheng live
not that you would ever die for another
because you ...
you are even more ruthless than i am
keep your word and i' il jump
i , wuhuan , am not usually a man of my word but i' il make an exception this once
general !
remember qingcheng , every man you ever love you will lose ...
welcome !
welcome !
how do you like my golden birdcage ?
is this where we are going to spend the night ?
did you think i brought you here to be my consort ?
you cannot seduce me
no ?
i thought you would be grateful
if it weren' t for me you would never have tasted such true and exquisite love
pity it was only for an instant
where is your beloved now ?
because of you , " he is dead !
put it on , my caged bird !
traitor !
assassin !
let' s go !
hang him up , let him die here !
think you could hide from us in the forest ?
if you hadn' t been our general we would have killed you ten times over !
leave him here to feed the wolves
general
in order to claim victory , you sacrificed 133 innocent slaves
this , i understand
but to kill the king for a woman ?
this , i cannot fathom
yeli , it wasn' t me who killed the king
you are the only man in the world who would dare do such a thing
if this is your opinion just deliver me to wuhuan ?
go ahead !
you have lost everything because of your recklessness
who says i have lost everything ?
i have lost nothing !
you have lost your bet it wasn' t me who killed the king
i never said it was you
all i said was
the master of the crimson armor would kill the king
i am the master of the crimson armor
not anymore
you don' t have to believe me but your destiny will not be altered
you are innocent yet you have been forced to bear the blame for the king' s death
fate works in mysterious ways
there are more losses to come and there is nothing you can do to stop them
soon you will lose even your cherished armor and be left with nothing
there will be a new master of the crimson armor
he alone will be the authentic god of war
and he alone will be loved by qingcheng , beauty of beauties
when the blossoms of the cherry tree all have fallen
when sun and moon appear side by side
qingcheng' s true love will come to her
i want to have another wager with you
i say i will retain my armor
and win the love of this qingcheng !
general , i love your confidence
such a shame ...
master , it was me who killed the king
why did you do it ?
i saw a man with a sword about to kill a woman
because of a woman
you disobeyed my order ?
you deserve to die but not just yet
go find this qingcheng and bring her to me
i will find her , master
give me back my armor
yes , master
kunlun !
what are you waiting for ?
through that door and we' il be free !
who is he ?
i also want to know
he must be from the land of snow ...
wait !
he is mad !
are you saying that guangming deceived me with nothing more than a switch of armor ?
and the one who pretended to be him was his slave ?
and i was outwitted by this slave ?
so you are the true assassin !
what is that in your hand ?
my lord , please examine this
the feather is mine !
yours ?
as a slave , even your life is not your own
they have stained my fan
take him away !
you do understand why they had to die don' t you ?
now that they are gone
nobody will know who really killed the king
still , you had better deal with the slave as well
when he is dead the people will condemn guangming as the assassin
you were the only one who could have killed the general
but you failed me in that mission
if now you refuse to kill your countryman
i shall have to take back my cloak and you will simply vanish into thin air
yes , master
i managed to untie myself but there is no exit
will you help me find a way out ?
come back up here and i will show you the way
you said i came from the land of snow
you said you would not kill me
if i don' t kill you , i will be killed !
