jeremiah ecks ?
no , sorry .
that' s you , isn' t it ?
what happened to your head ?
bad haircut .
look , we' ve been instructed to bring you in .
i' m not the man you want .
forget this .
we' il do it the hard way .
that' s not a healthy attitude .
neither is yours .
relax , addis .
yeah , relax .
listen to your partner .
this guy' s nothing .
who sent you ?
fbi assistant director julio martin .
julio .
hello , ecks .
we need to talk .
the answer is no .
i' il need a car here at 3 : 00 .
no , make it 2 : 30 .
i don' t want to get stuck in this holiday traffic .
vinn is alive .
you' re lying .
taken off a cellular sweep .
i saw her die .
you saw an explosion .
i went to her funeral .
you saw a closed casket .
you waited seven years to tell me ?
i' d have told you if i' d known .
where is she ?
i don' t know .
then why are you here ?
i need you to do a job for me .
where is my wife ?
i' m sorry .
i need you to do it ...
where is she ?
when the job is done , i' il give you what i got .
no , you don' t want to do this .
i don' t have a choice .
i have a situation and you' re my only option .
i tell you what i know right now , and you' re gone .
i' m gone anyway .
sit in the corner .
you' il provoke him when he returns .
you' il be joining an fbi transnational special task force .
make it 2 : 30 .
i don' t want to get stuck in this holiday traffic .
you were supposed to protect my son .
she took us by surprise .
how do i explain that to my wife ?
in more noble times ... ... when a knight failed his king ... ... he fell on his sword .
sir ?
do the honorable thing , agent curtis .
take the gun .
put it against your head .
pull the trigger .
now .
how much time do we have ?
based on our tests , we have 28 hours left .
then my son dies .
do whatever it takes , ross .
get me michael .
you know who we' re up against .
you know what she wants .
well , i can' t give it to her , now can i ?
on the left is a. j. ross .
his team arrived in vancouver five hours ago .
prince of darkness .
lf you know so much , just pick him up .
i don' t want him .
i want the man he works for , robert gant .
robert gant ?
intel is purposely limited .
but a shadow government ... ... in the name of national security is still a shadow government .
this is gant' s latest acquisition .
code name " softkill .
he' s been trying to build a perfect assassin .
but he' s never been able to lick the one thing that got in his way .
the human factor .
for gant , emotions are a liability .
a machine would solve that problem .
he could give a head of state a heart attack or an aneurysm .
totally undetectable .
it' s the future of his business .
looks like he licked the problem .
more like he stole it .
a prototype was developed at a facility in berlin .
last week , the place was torched .
the media called it an accident .
ross just happened to be there .
and the prototype ?
we thermoscanned ross and his men before they boarded their plane .
all clean .
no sign of the prototype .
thank you , louise .
it all checked out until last night .
ecks , this is special agent harry lee .
we pulled that from a traffic cam .
this woman single handedly took out an armed dla escort detail ... ... and kidnapped a young boy .
gant' s son .
based on ross being here , yes , we think so .
obviously a professional .
is she ours or theirs ?
no idea .
my money pegs her as disaffected dla .
profiles , photos , anything ?
just that .
if she' s dla , she' s orphan class , out of china .
orphan class ?
one child per family .
all families want a boy .
the dla secretly adopts some of these girls .
they' re weaned on violence .
trained to do nothing ... ... but kill in a thousand ways .
no fear .
no conscience .
no morality .
exactly what gant wants in an employee .
whoever she is , she' s obviously pissed off at him .
that' s why i need you to find her .
of course you do .
is that why they call you " x " ?
i' m on a diet .
that' s my wife and my daughter .
her name' s mali .
do you love her ?
of course .
then get out of this business .
gun team , disable target on my command .
don' t cancel .
we need her alive .
acknowledge .
roger that .
affirmative .
is the target aware ?
no , sir .
is her back to you ?
affirmative .
positive visual .
we got her too .
freeze .
she' s got a gun !
get down !
close one is not responding .
i' ve lost her .
too much motion .
you have her ?
negative .
please advise .
call in the local p. d. we' il use them for cover .
target clear .
why is she standing there ?
she knows you won' t kill her .
pin her down !
the local p. d. has been alerted .
they' re coming in .
move !
move !
gun team , do you see her ?
negative .
do not let her breach the perimeter .
jesus !
do not cancel target .
keep her contained .
where' s my tactical team ?
run .
don' t shoot !
sniper one , what are you waiting for ?
disable target !
all units , shots fired .
suspect is female . vancouver library .
that' s her .
julio ?
we heard .
we' re on it .
tracking target .
all right , let' s move it !
get her !
we lost contact with our tactical unit .
who' s manning the assault vehicle ?
shit !
get out of here !
get down !
cover me !
cover me !
stay back please , sir .
you shouldn' t be here .
somebody get too much foam in their latte ?
i' m in no mood .
that makes two of us .
i know about that job you pulled in berlin .
you' re getting sloppy .
enjoy your stay in vancouver .
who' s the woman ?
somebody your boss pushed too far ?
stay out of this .
this is an issue of national security .
you mean job security ?
wouldn' t want to be you when gant sees this mess .
you' re sweating .
it' s been raining .
be smart .
walk away .
julio ?
yeah .
take your people out of here .
what is it ?
a feeling .
get them out .
now .
what the hell are you talking about ?
she will retaliate .
we' re covered .
a curtain call here would be suicide .
you' re wrong .
how can you be sure ?
trust me .
she' s not done yet .
down !
get down !
julio !
she knows .
she knows where your wife is .
martin is down !
paramedic !
paramedic !
over here !
come on , baby .
come on .
yeah .
hey , beautiful !
what ...
my nose !
i think it' s broken .
let me see .
where is she ?
i didn' t touch her .
mobile unit one on site .
situation out of hand .
suggest the locals take this one .
bitch .
head for the highest vantage point .
they' re on foot .
they can' t be hard to spot .
drop your weapon !
you kill me , you kill gant' s son .
i don' t work for gant .
i just want my wife .
shit !
i' m okay .
the bullet hit my vest .
ross , do you have my son yet ?
we' ve sighted our target .
no word on the package .
we may have another problem .
where is my wife ?
where is she ?
what' s your hurry ?
chase one , we have your hot target locked .
our new player might do the job for us .
advise .
don' t let them cancel each other .
roger that .
going green for a quarantine .
target' s on the move , over north side of building .
it' s not polite to stare .
i see you' ve met mali .
come here , sweetie .
how you doing ?
what' s up ?
go find mom .
so my daughter wanted to know why you look so sad .
i told her it' s because you just got beat up by a girl .
you know , ecks , martin didn' t want to do it .
use your wife as bait to get you back in the game .
but he had no choice .
how is he ?
not bad , considering .
bullet missed his heart by about a centimeter .
she doesn' t miss .
what are you saying ?
nothing .
could you give me a laptop ...
... and julio' s notes on this case ?
i thought you might say that .
let me see your hand .
who' s running the task force now ?
nobody .
we' re suspended pending an inquiry .
which means i probably shouldn' t watch you do this .
you' re not even here .
right .
sever .
freeze !
get your hands above your head !
oh , man .
you' re under arrest for the shooting of agent julio martin .
we have her online , sir .
put her through .
where' s my son , sever ?
maybe the same place my son is .
don' t blame me .
you broke profile .
is that what you call having a child ?
they weren' t supposed to be there .
sever ?
sever ?
how' s michael ?
fine .
he' s a good boy .
but he misses his mother .
i want him back .
you mean you want what he' s carrying .
he could die if we don' t get it out .
i didn' t put it in him .
you did .
tell that to your wife .
what do you want ?
your life for michael' s .
it didn' t have to come to this , sever .
well , now it has .
you pulled his file ?
yes , sir .
here' s the printout .
sever still has gant' s kid .
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
you better pay attention because she won' t stop until she gets him .
i can find her ... ... bring back the kid .
sever is dla .
she knows all your tricks .
she doesn' t know mine .
we can handle this .
you' re certainly doing a great job of it .
why do you care ?
that' s my business .
yes .
the local p. d. has our man .
id ?
former fbi agent named jeremiah ecks .
get rid of him .
sorry , ecks , you' re a local matter .
we' re done here .
you' re making a mistake .
she' s gonna kill you .
captain , this isn' t my jurisdiction ... ... but i suggest you take him away before i make it my jurisdiction .
good luck .
is he alive ?
yes , i' m sure of it .
why do they want michael ?
i don' t know .
you' re lying .
i swear .
do they want money ?
i don' t know .
this should have never happened .
michael should have been home with me .
i' m doing everything i can to find him .
what are you doing exactly ?
you know i can' t divulge details .
of course .
i' m sorry .
you promised me this wouldn' t happen .
you think i haven' t tried to keep that promise ?
just find him .
mobile two has visual of target .
shit !
you wanted your wife ?
you' il find her with gant .
we need to talk .
we' re running out of options .
ecks is mobile .
sever helped him escape .
what the hell does she want with him ?
can i ask why this man is so dangerous ?
no .
what did you find out ?
they' re still looking .
you needed to lock yourself in the study for that ?
you know how it works .
i' il take care of it .
why is this person trying to hurt us ?
what did you do to him ?
her .
she used to work for me .
oh , god .
god , no .
she won' t hurt michael .
how can you be so sure ?
trust me .
i need you to be strong .
then leave .
where are you going ?
out .
how much time do we have ?
less than 1 2 hours .
thank you .
hello , vinn .
jeremy ?
what' s going on , jeremy ?
i am taking a deep cover assignment .
baby ... ... please don' t take this one .
i wish i didn' t have to .
then don' t .
quit .
this is my job .
this is what i do .
why did this have to happen to us ?
it' s a means to an end .
gant had an agenda .
me , he had to get rid of , and you ...
well , you he wanted .
and so he took you .
i know , i know .
i' m late .
i know he loved me ... ... but i only became his wife ... ... in name .
you' re the one that i love .
i never stopped loving you .
you had a son with him .
no .
not with him .
michael ?
i knew that day in the restaurant .
i wanted to tell you .
i wanted you to stay , but i didn' t want you to worry about me ... ... about us .
he' s our son .
yours and mine .
he was the only piece of you i had left .
oh , god , no !
jeremy !
i thought that staying with gant ... ... was the only way to protect michael .
but i was wrong .
michael .
hey , listen to me .
i found you .
we' il find him .
what do we do now ?
run .
is that the bitch who stole our son ?
i see you found your wife .
where is michael ?
your son ?
yes , my son .

and by the way ... ... l' m the bitch protecting him .
air one to command , we have target in sight .
how do you know about michael ?
prison bus .
i could have been killed .
but you weren' t .
you do know we have company .
of course .
of course .
air one to command .
target' s destination is the south end of victoria park .
he' s up there .
michael ?
mommy !
sweetie .
where were you , mom ?
are you okay ?
thank god .
i was so worried about you .
i missed you so much .
i missed you too , mommy .
i wasn' t even scared .

hello .
i am jeremy .
you' re michael , right ?

you' il be safer up there until this is over .
where do you get all this ordnance ?
some women buy shoes .
sweet .
all teams are in position .
they move on my order .
what about your wife and son ?
ecks will protect them .
and sever ?
she' s been mourning her family long enough .
let' s reunite them .
sir , with all due respect , that' s an unacceptable level of exposure .
let' s see .
you lost my son .
you just lost my wife .
you think i' ve lost my mind too ?
i didn' t set this in play .
you did .
i warned you of the risks .
your job is to fix my messes .
it should never have gotten this far .
let' s get this over with .
gant .
sever .
this doesn' t have to get messy .
i just want you .
i make you the same offer .
send out what belongs to me .
then we can discuss your reinsertion .
it' s a little late for that .
it' s never too late .
tell that to vinn .
i can upgrade your status .
allow you the luxury of a family .
i had a family .
you know who we are , sever .
targets and objectives come first .
this is the way our world is .
they were innocent .
there are no innocent people .
you know that .
only killers and victims .
take her out .
yes , sir .
go .
my turn .
get down !
go .
move out !
go !
moving in !
go , go , go !
give me that .
let' s finish this .
shit .
hello , jeremiah .
agent clark .
it' s been a long time .
why ?
come on .
you should know by now .
we had to get rid of agent clark ... ... so there could be a robert gant .
so you rise from the ashes with a license to do whatever you want .
power and profit .
it' s what we do .
where are my wife and son ?
last time i checked , they were not yours .
come on , jeremiah .
i' d hate for either of them to get hurt in the middle of this .
you' re standing pretty close ... ... gant .
what if i decided to lift my foot right now ?
i guarantee you won' t walk away from this one .
run !
make sure he' s dead .
yes , sir .
ross .
sever .
just like old times .
one big happy family .
right , sever ?
hello , my love .
robert .
are you okay ?
what do you want ?
i' ve come for my family .
just stay away from us , okay ?
why would i ever stay away from you ?
are you okay , michael ?
have you been taking care of mommy ?
yes .
look at this .
look what i got for you .
what are you doing ?
give me your hand .
robert , no .
gant .
you' re still here .
he was about to do something to michael .
no .
it was never about michael .
of course it' s about michael .
what are you talking about ?
a piece of hardware gant wants .
he stole it in berlin .
used michael to carry it across the border .
you used my son ?
you sick son of a bitch .
come here , michael .
it' s okay .
give me your hand .
that' s a good boy .
it' s not here .
come here , sweetie .
where is it ?
where is it ?
ask her .
she' s gonna kill you .
good luck .
all that training .
is that the best you can do ?
no .
this is .
let' s go , let' s go .
move it .
get that fire knocked down !
they weren' t kidding about you .
i can' t take credit for this .
where' s our mysterious killer ?
she' s not a killer .
then what is she ?
a mother .
okay , then where is she ?
thank you .
take care of your family .
i will .
