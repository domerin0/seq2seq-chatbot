the jungle to the untrained eye looks the same as in our first movie , but things have changed , and it' s not just because we' re using a different set , domestic bliss has broken out over the bukuvu , parenthood has found that defender of the innocent , and all around good guy , george of the jungle .
george , george , george of the jungle
watch out for that tree
and as our story begins , our popular potent potentate has produced a prince .
huh ?
wait a minute !
who the heck are you ? !
me , new george .
studio too cheap to pay brendan fraser .
let' s go , dad .
how did you get the part ?
new george just lucky , i guess .
hey , dad , check it out .
let' s play fetch with shep .
shep !
here we go , boy .
fetch !
fetch stick , shep .
come on , shep .
now that the prince is turning five ,
george is grooming his son to be the heir to the throne .
george , that' s grooming him to be heir , not grooming his hair .
oh .
oh , yeah .
while george was preparing his son ,
ursula the love of his life , and the heiress who gave up everything to be his jungle queen , was wondering why george wasn' t home for lunch .
why isn' t george home for lunch ?
but george couldn' t go home for lunch because he had to attend to a very important matter .
george pretty good at coconut ball .
ok .
ok .
hit me !
but suddenly the game was interrupted by an urgent bongo gram .
i said , an urgent bongo gram .
george really late for lunch .
george , george , george of the jungle
strong as he can be
watch out for that ... tree
sorry george late , but george had important royal duty to attend to .
in other words , you were playing coconut ball .
george score winning goal .
ursula come and try out for cheerleader ?
i tried , but the gorillas turned me down because i wasn' t pretty enough .
you look pretty to me .
you should tell the gorillas .
george promise tonight spend whole night with ursula .
ok ?
ok .
can george give junior vine swinging lesson ?
vine swinging' s a little dangerous .
must be from your side of family .
vine surfing is much cooler .
what dangerous about swinging ?
swinging fun .
george show you .
maybe that' s not such a good idea .
why ?
it easy .
george , watch out for that ...
for the first time in history ,
george didn' t hit the tree he was aiming at , but that didn' t stop him from hitting ... the second tree .
and , in case you were worried , the new george takes a tree as well as brendan fraser .
while george was sliding down the tree ,
ape has been in las vegas becoming a different sort of swinger .
but while pursuing his singing career , the lure of the cards has proven too much for our travelling troubadour .
you got to learn to play it right
you got to know when to hold ' em
know when to fold ' em
if you wouldn' t mind , could you stop singing ?
sorry .
cut the cards .
welcome to las vegas , baby .
and they say humans are more evolved .
meanwhile , back in the jungle ,
george was taking care of some serious jungle business .
george , the sink' s stuffed again .
well , kind of serious .
don' t worry , george fix .
ok .
george , you better answer the bird .
hello .
animals in big fight .
george know he promise ursula he see her tonight ,
ok if george go to help animals ?
if george can come home early , would ursula still go out with george ?
george , george , george of the jungle
george , george , george of the jungle
watch out for that ...
stop the movie !
that' s how animals usually sound , right ?
in our movie the animals are all going to talk ,
so you humans don' t miss a thing .
where' s your team now ?
anyone know how to fix sink ?
for the convenience of you animals we' ve added subtitles , so you can follow along too .
this is all their fault .
the birds keep dropping their zug zug on us .
incoming .
it' s disgusting !
i gotta wear a hat !
why not make zug zug treaty ?
zug zug treaty ?
yes , zug zug treaty .
this is disney , if we' re gonna do a zug zug joke , we' re gonna make it educational .
we make treaty and get everyone to go zug zug in separate areas .
that' s a good idea .
now you can play coconut ball .
george can' t stay .
and why not , george ?
have evening planned with ursula .
when lions ruled the jungle , we never neglected our subjects , why are you neglecting us ?
george in love .
you' ve gotta be kidding me .
get outta here .
run home to your family .
never trust anyone without fangs .
george didn' t impress his bachelor pals , but he did manage to impress his wife .
george lucky man .
he' s got ursula and junior ... .. and really strong head .
honey , i wouldn' t worry about junior swinging .
he' s the son of the greatest swinger of all time , how could he not learn how to swing ?
that make george happy .
sorry about sink .
it' s not your fault , it' s just the way things are sometimes .
sure ursula like being here with george ?
how can you say that ?
then ursula think things be ok , right ?
cos george rather not be king than lose ursula .
oh , don' t be silly , everything' s fine .
george hope so , cos he love ursula more than there are stars in sky .
and george have special surprise to cheer ursula up .
ursula , dance with george .
like a simple question looking for an answer
now i am , now i am , listening to some inner call
swimming blindly to pull myself upon your shore
what if i don' t find you when i have landed ?
would you leave me here to die on your shores flat dead ?
i think i know why the dog howls at the moon
i think i know why the dog howls at the moon
i said
when i' m with you ...
george and ursula were in love .
little did they know that someone was approaching , who was going to change their lives for ever , someone so malevolent , so machiavellian , so ...
well , for you kids , let' s just say really , really mean .
stay still , i don' t want to fall off .
yes , it was beatrice stanhope , ursula' s mother .
hello .
it' s the man who would be your son in law .
yes , that' s ursula' s foppish former fianc , lyle van de groot .
you remember the graceful van de groot from the first movie .
was it really necessary to show that scene ?
it seems the vengeful , venal van de groot had bought the casino ape was gambling in .
lyle had finally come up with the perfect plan to destroy george by stealing the deed to ape mountain .
are you sure ape has the deed ?
it is , after all , called ape mountain .
and as soon as i have cheated the ape out of the deed , and driven that half wit george off of his land , bulldozers roll , driving ursula right back into my waiting arms .
when they see my gifts , they' il miss civilisation so much they' il beg me to take them back .
i' ve gotta go .
what did he say ?
he said hold on .
i' m going to ...
oh , i' ve had it !
are you sure we' re going in the right direction ?
why , yes .
we remember from the first movie .
it' s very important i get to ape mountain today .
it' s my grandson' s fifth birthday .
i' m taking him and ursula back to civilisation .
what did he say ?
he was admiring your luggage .
oh , well , whatever .
and he wondered why you want to take your grandson out of the jungle .
i' m not having him grow up here an illiterate savage .
someone help !
put me down !
help !
sorry , we can' t kill beatrice .
if she dies , we have no story .
and if we have no story , george couldn' t disappoint his wife again by being late for his own son' s birthday party .
i wonder what' s keeping your father .
guess we may as well get started .
now remember , sweetie , you can wish for anything you want .
except your grandmother , because she' s already here .
grandma !
mother !
darling .
hello , junior .
well , where' s that husband of yours ?
shouldn' t he be at his own son' s birthday party ?
he' s running late .
how could he possibly be running late ?
this is the jungle .
traffic back up on the bukuvu expressway ?
dad !
george sorry he' s late , but zug zug treaty broke down and had to step in .
hello , old mrs ursula .
beatrice cunningly connived to tempt ursula and junior back home using a ploy that has worked since the beginning of time .
i have gifts for you .
mother , you shouldn' t have .
george also make present .
cool !
thanks , dad .
whoa !
cool , a spear !
that' s nice .
yeah .
how' d you like to play with this ?
wow !
you just flip the switch and it can do anything you want .
that not look so hard .
beatrice put in motion her gift giving gambit to get ursula to come home .
meanwhile , george demonstrated why he was no william tell .
and neither was his aimless son .
stay there .
ok .
good .
ok .
ok , aim .
good .
see gorilla ?
ok .
now throw .
throw .
throw !
good .
huh ?
but a coconut wasn' t enough to nullify the muddled mind of our hero ,
george continued to be torn by the conflict between home and throne .
come on , george .
ya have to supervise the oo oo feather picking .
sorry , george can' t .
promise ursula he stay home .
but no king has ever missed oo oo feather picking .
at least not when lions ruled .
face it .
he doesn' t care about us anymore .
george .
old mrs ursula .
come talk .
george , do you love your wife and your son ?
george love ursula and junior very much .
and george sorry george late for junior' s birthday party .
i understand perfectly .
you don' t have enough time for your subjects or family
which is why you can see how much happier ursula and junior would be if they came back to san francisco .
ursula' s lonely .
she misses her friends and someplace to wear lovely dresses .
junior needs to live in civilisation and go to school with other children .
what do you think george should do ?
george should let them go .
as much as she tried to resist , the once opulent ursula was tempted by the bangles and baubles .
feeling dazed and confused , or more dazed and confused than normal ,
george sought professional help .
george know tookie trying , but need talk to brother ape .
maybe tookie fly to get brother ape ?
then george just talk more .
while tookie was winging his way to las vegas , he ...
i said las vegas !
ape found himself with problems of his own .
if you' re gonna play the game , boy
you got to learn to play it right
you got to know when to hold ' em
know when to fold ...
i' ve had more pleasure listening to alligators sing than you , ya stupid bum !
while ape was busy strangling his pestering poker partner ,
tookie' s tuckered mind began to wander .
another mimosa , mr tookie tookie ?
oh , tookie , you cad .
as ourjungle jet setter flew to visit his primate pal ,
ursula confronted beatrice for befuddling her handsome hubby .
mother .
i' d appreciate it if you wouldn' t play with george' s mind .
well , there really isn' t much to play with , but alright .
ursula , i know you' re unhappy here .
you can' t fool your mother .
i' il admit there are certain things i miss about home , but i love george and i am staying here .
so deal with it .
ok ?
hello .
ursula' s definitely weakening .
if i can just get her back to civilisation and to you
that is , if you' ve got your obsession with her under control ?
of course i have it under control .
obsession , ... a strong word .
have you got the deed from ape yet ?
no , but i' il have it tonight .
and when i do , bulldozers will roll .
roll !
i have a foolproof plan .
he did .
because in a demonstration of despicable dishonesty ,
lyle had entered the poker game .
see if you can figure out which one he is .
you foolish fowl .
what are you doing here ?
george is suffering deep psychological damage over whether ursula' s happy and if he' s a good husband and king , and he' s in need of my immediate advice and counsel ?
in a moment !
i' m sitting on a great hand here !
yes , the gambling bug had bit our normally guarded gorilla .
i' il take three .
maybe my luck will change .
but luck wasn' t in the cards for our poker playing primate .
as the game progressed , there was a strange sense in the room that ape was about to be cheated out of the deed .
i' d like to stay in , but i have nothing left to bet .
i' m broke .
maybe you have something of value ?
stocks , bonds , real estate ... in africa ?
i' m afraid not .
don' t you own ...
oh , what' s it called , ape mountain ?
no , the deed belongs to the legendary george of the jungle .
perhaps you' ve heard of him ?
vaguely .
so , what are you holding , nostril damus ?
there .
just four queens .
well , i' m holding four lyles .
but don' t you worry your pretty little hairy head about it .
you can work off the debt performing in my club ... for the next 17 years .
what ?
hello .
it turns out the big ape didn' t have the deed .
how could ape not own ape mountain ?
that' s like saying the rockefellers don' t own rockefeller center .
they don' t !
oh .
it turns out your idiot son in law has it .
but where does he keep it ?
let me ask him .
george , where do you keep the deed to ape mountain ?
george hide in butt flap .
enchanting .
he keeps it in his underwear .
how do we get him and his underwear back here ... so i can take it ?
tookie .
ape can' t come talk to george because broke ?
in big trouble ?
george must go vegas to help .
thrilled that george was leaving , beatrice beamed like a cheshire cat .
george is coming .
what' s he doing with all that luggage ?
hey , he' s leaving .
it' s comments like that which justify why i eat you .
now i know why they call you really mean lion .
oh , yeah .
last time he left , the jungle nearly fell apart .
it' s so obvious , george only wants to be with his own kind now .
but don' t worry , i' il take care of you .
unaware of the threat home and abroad ,
george and his extended jungle family took off on their first trip .
look .
look .
las vegas !
anxious to speak to his brethren , ape , but not wanting to stand out like a simian from the sticks ,
george made a stop .
new george look pretty good in armani , too .
farklempt at finally finding each other again ,
george and his brother , ape , had a big emotional reunion .
hi .
hello .
oh , come on , you can do better than that .
oh , george !
please !
let it off .
george so happy to see brother , ape .
me , too .
what are you doing here ?
george here to help .
tookie say ape in trouble .
broke .
busted .
no benjamins .
broke ?
it' s all a big misunderstanding .
i' m perfectly fine .
that' s ... why i' m giving away all my furniture .
george happy ape perfectly fine .
only wish george perfectly fine .
what' s the matter ?
ursula and animals think george spend too much time with other .
george so upset , think about taking off neck crown .
look , i understand your concern .
and if i return ...
when i return , i' il coordinate your schedule to everyone' s satisfaction .
it' s just a question of balance .
george good at balance .
george worried about ursula .
she' s lonely and she worried she not cook or clean as well as ape .
well , she might have a point there .
george worried she miss civilisation more than she miss george .
don' t be ridiculous !
ursula adores you .
she' s probably just suffering from the five year itch .
what george do ?
what any husband would do .
get her a nice present to help scratch it .
a ... backscratcher .
to help with itch .
as the jungle king demonstrated the many uses of his gift , his arch animal enemy was back in the jungle trying to take over his throne .
george of the jungle has deserted you .
if you elect me your king ,
i promise to make every tuesday " meatless tuesday .
but if you don' t make me king ...
oh , i' m scared ! .. you have no idea what a mean lion i can really be .
as the mean lion schemed against him , his perfidious plotters in las vegas put the finishing touches on their perspicacious plan .
better turn off the alarm .
the old witch says he keeps the deed in his underwear .
that' s disgusting .
at least it' il be easy to find .
these look familiar .
obviously he was planning to stay for a while .
you would think at some point , ursula would recommend a zebra pattern .
unaware of the deadly denizens determined to destroy him ...
well , that' s a change of pace . .. our accidental tourist took his family backstage at circus circus .
as george gleefully greeted his performing pals , ... .. ursula wondered if she' d ever come first .
george , this is rocky .
he' s very honoured to meet you .
why do they call him rocky ?
because when he gets nervous , he does that .
george ... honoured ... to ... meet ...
rocky ... too .
he says he was born in a cage , but he wants to return home with you and learn to become a real jungle kangaroo .
cage is not good for animals .
george , kangaroos live in australia , we can' t bring rocky back to the bukuvu .
tell him we' re really sorry .
don' t worry , george , he won' t bother you again .
while our simple simian was being stalked by a star struck kangaroo ,
lyle and the women were still searching our simple simian' s shorts .
what now ?
it' il take us years to go through the rest of these .
and it would have , too , had the precise , practical , pragmatic ursula not labelled them .
oo oo feathers .
hyena burger .
wait a second .
deed .
lyle immediately dispatched a dastardly disciple to the jungle , who enjoyed evicting the animals .
in every other story the king of the jungle is a lion not a human .
and so , as is my birthright ,
i now declare myself king of the jungle !
this is really bad !
tuesdays are still meatless , right ?
you can' t be king without the amulet .
then i' il just have to get it back , won' t i ?
we need george .
where' s george ?
george' s friends were worried .
while lyle celebrated getting the deed in a typically mature fashion .
i have the deed
i have the deed
this is the deed i have
i have the deed
getting the deed is only half the battle .
it means nothing unless you get ursula to fall in love with you .
are you prepared for tonight ?
i' m prepared .
and so was ape , because they had all come to see the swinging songster perform .
eat !
now , when i count to three , you will awaken and feel refreshed , and remember nothing .
one .
two .
three .
lce cream ?
but i' m lactose intolerant !
oops .
sorry .
remember , i am armando , and i can hypnotise anyone to do anything !
good night !
the conrad jupiter' s hotel and casino is proud to present the selected song stylings of the one and only ape !
here he comes
walking down the street
he gets the funniest looks from everyone he meets
hey , hey , i' m a monkey
and people say i monkey around
well , i' m too busy singing to put anybody down
i' m just trying to be friendly
come and watch me sing and play
i' m the young generation
and i' ve got something to say
hey , hey i' m the monkey
hey , hey , i' m a monkey
hey , hey , i' m a monkey
hey , hey i' m the monkey
yeah !
hey !
yeah !
hey , hey , i' m a monkey
yeah !
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
girls .
you were wonderful
ape will be back in a few minutes with his tribute to tony orlando .
it' s from the gentleman over there .
lyle .
beatrice , you' re looking lovely .
ursula , what a small world .
you remember my son in law , george .
i do .
george .
clearly the best man won .
but no hard feelings .
shake .
what are you doing here ?
last time we saw you , you tried to have george killed ,
ape captured , and dragged me off to marry you .
that actually wasn' t me , kitten , that was the altitude sickness .
it just so happens , i have my doctor here , dr kerner .
in my opinion lyle was not responsible for his actions due to the lack of oxygen in the bukuvu mountains .
you knew i was gonna be here ?
you' re fired .
i didn' t know that you were gonna be here .
i ran into the lords of oompah practising your favourite song , i wanna know what love is .
what' s that ?
wait a minute .
that not ursula' s favourite song .
this ursula' s favourite song .
one banana , two banana .
no !
we' re dead meat .
i thought i was making progress .
that ape has a better chance with her than you do .
he does ?
what have you heard ?
it' s time we brought in some reinforcements .
here' s your towels , angels .
thanks , charlie .
hey , don' t hog the choco blast .
mmm .
i' il give you it if courtney gives up the funky monkey .
haven' t you seen enough funky monkeys ?
i' ve missed you guys .
and we' ve missed you .
speaking of things you' ve missed , lyle' s looking amazing .
you' re right .
he' s such a catch .
he' s charming , rich , sensitive .
and is equally at home with small animals and children .
are you reading that ?
i can' t believe my mother flew you here just to tell me about lyle .
your mother didn' t send us here .
we' re worried about you .
yeah , i mean , a fling any of us could understand .
and would gladly have traded places with you .
yeah .
we' re concerned you' il change .
come on .
i haven' t changed a bit .
i can' t believe i just did that .
i guess i have changed .
you belong here .
your whole identity will get swallowed up by george , and the ursula we know and love will disappear .
you deserve a husband who' d rather spend time with you than a gorilla .
but i love george .
doesn' t mean he' s right for you .
you and lyle have more in common .
she' s right .
you should be with someone who' s refined , polished , someone who cares about your feelings .
george doesn' t know how to make you happy .
look , what' s this great present he gets you ?
a backscratcher .
and where did he take you on your first day back in civilisation ?
backstage at circus circus .
can you believe his lack of feeling ?
you' ve been isolated from all your friends , hungry for human companionship , and he brings you to an animal show .
how selfish .
this man doesn' t love you , darling , he hardly knows you .
it' il be so wonderful when you' re finally home .
the opera opens next month .
and we can go to the canyon ranch to have some kind of total makeover .
and there' s that wonderful charity cruise for some kind of poor people .
oh , yeah .
wait a second .
what ?
i ... am the luckiest woman in the whole world .
so he isn' t the greatest retail shopper .
i have a man i love and a child i adore , and he gives me what all of you pray for .
i want my george .
what do we do now ?
i don' t know .
oh , look to your left .
i think i have an idea .
yes , in a brilliantly desperate attempt to bring ursula and lyle together ,
our masterminding major domo mother in law has hired armando to hypnotise ursula into forgetting george .
when you awaken , the name george of the jungle will forever be stricken from your memory .
hey .
sorry i' m late .
there was a fat lady in a wheelchair hogging the handicap spot .
his face will be blank .
you will not recognise him .
he will mean absolutely nothing to you .
oh , yes .
ursula , your husband is lyle van de groot .
one .
two .
three .
pumpkin !
it took two movies and a crooked hypnotist , but the lecherous lyle van de groot had finally gotten his wish .
ursula was , in a manner of speaking , his wife .
hello ?
hello ?
hello ?
turn the phone around , you idiot !
this george , george looking for ursula .
oh , she' s here with junior .
she doesn' t love you anymore .
she' s left you for lyle .
ursula leave george ?
yes .
she' s with lyle now .
george want to tell her that george stop being king if she take him back .
too late .
you should have thought of that when you had no time for her .
the people she misses are here .
she lives here now .
face it , george , your experiment with having a family has been a failure .
you' re not fit to be a husband or a father .
go back to the animals where you belong .
junior .
goodbye , ursula .
junior .
come on , dear , we don' t wanna miss our flight .
everything' s so foggy .
lyle' s my husband ?
yes , darling .
you' ve been under a lot of stress lately .
hold your father' s hand .
you' re not my father !
not polite kick daddy !
having heedlessly hewn our hero' s heavy heart into hittle hieces ...
i mean , little pieces , the vengeful van de groot tried to impress his pilfered princess ursula with a dazzling display of animal magnetism .
come here .
see , honey , horses are my friends .
kind of .
maybe " friend " is too strong .
are you sure lyle' s my husband ?
see , honey , horses love me .
come here .
horses ... love ... me !
horses love me !
you guys ready to go for a ride ?
how' d you ever let me marry that guy ?
while they tried to figure out why ursula was married to an idiot ,
lyle' s bulldozers were arriving to clear the animals out of the bukuvu .
locked up by the mean lion to keep him from contacting his former king , the tactile tookie tookie had been plotting his escape .
george can' t live without ursula , so george going to get her back .
tookie !
mean lion crown himself king ?
animals kicked off land ?
need george to save animals ? !
have two days ? !
ape !
we have to go right away .
i should' ve told you earlier , but i have some gambling debts that i have to work off for a little while .
how little ?
17 years .
george think maybe that might be too late .
when we get home , ape can take out loan from bukuvu credit union .
george , these aren' t nice people .
george won' t go without ape .
future of jungle and george depends on it .
alright , george .
yeah !
yes .
yes .
must get wife and son , who don' t want me , and amulet to lead troops .
then the question is , how to get the two of us up to san francisco ?
better make that three of us .
come on !
come on !
jungle boogie .
go , go , go !
going somewhere ?
who are you , xena , princess of vegas ?
we' il see how funny you are in a cage at the van de groot zoo .
in case you' ve forgotten , you still owe us 17 years of employment .
get moving .
run !
rocky , get hopping .
come on .
let' s get ' em .
excuse me .
george sorry .
thank you .
excuse me .
outta the way !
move !
nice .
look out !

let' s go .
watch out , george !
yeah , that way .
i' il get backup !
quick !
watch out for that ... !
hey , you !
stop !
call the police !
and animal control !
what now , ape ?
oh , dear .
back away from the edge of the building .
come on , guys .
up here .
there they are .
don' t move .
you' re surrounded .
you have no choice but to surrender .
we' il send a man down to cut off any escape .
i' m sorry , old chum , we did everything we could .
george have idea .
just do like george !
ape !
jump !
come on !
go !
george , i' ve been away from the jungle a very long time !
george catch you !
don' t make any sudden moves !
don' t you think that' s beneath us ?
ape !
good kick , rocky !
don' t do it !
here goes !
what are they doing ?
whoo !
do not swing on the ladder !
we' re going to find a safe place to land .
do not swing .
you' re destabilising the helicopter .
we gotta land .
oh , this is lovely .
this best swing george ever had !
because george and his jungle buddy are swinging together ?
no , because not possible for george to hit ...
yes fans , we' ve also included the empire state building .
at least the las vegas version .
watch out for that ... !
you didn' t think we were gonna pass up this parody .
george !
come on !
you can do it !
come on !
reach !
now !
again !
swing over !
thanks forjoining us .
in a bizarre case of life imitating art , tonight' s drama over las vegas has reached the very heights of the empire state building .
our correspondent ...
something about that ape feels really familiar .
it' s king kong .
i thought king kong was in black and white .
would you believe hollywood ?
they colourised it .
reach !
reach !
grab me !
come on !
got you !
pull !
units are arriving on the scene to get you down .
so got any other ideas ?
follow george .
brilliant .
meanwhile , that dastardly duo of damsels , sally and kowalski , were searching every nook and cranny .
that' s cranny , not granny !
as halfway around the world , an advancing army prepared to invade the bukuvu .
and in san francisco , ursula pondered her present predicament .
i always had the fantasy that when i kissed the man i love ,
i' d hear church bells ringing .
church bells ringing ?
and fireworks .
fireworks .
loud , spectacular , take your breath away , fourth of july fireworks .
with lyle , there' s just ...
.. lyle .
yeah .
so much for fantasy .
i can' t help feeling that something' s missing .
that somewhere out there , something' s waiting for me .
sorry to surprise ursula .
george can' t live without ursula .
george madly in love .
look , ...
i don' t know who you are , but i' m married , ... unfortunately .
right .
george ursula' s husband .
ursula more confused than george .
but no time to talk .
bukuvu in trouble .
must get back .
george put ursula first then jungle .
listen .
i' ve never heard of the bukuvu and lyle' s my husband .
though i have to admit , you are quite attractive .
and have the sinewy arms of a god !
but i' m old fashioned and take my marriage vows very seriously .
then can i have him ?
sorry , george love ursula more than anything in the world .
ursula mean everything to george .
do you have any brothers at home ?
i have brother ape .
oooh , ... an ape .
can you give him my phone number ?
having deposited his dipsy darling with ape ,
george nervously swung in to see if his son still remembered him .
junior ?
daddy !
i missed you so much .
george realise something .
if junior want to surf and not swing it' s ok with george , because george love junior so much , nothing else matters .
come here .
i love you too , dad .
but i think you better talk to mom , because she' s been acting strange .
yeah .
come on !
i' il take the stairs .
ok .
so with his devoted son and dormant wife ,
george headed back to his homeland .
after a tip from brendan fraser , who was cramped during the first picture , this time he made sure to get a bigger crate .
dad , i' m afraid .
hmm .
what are we gonna do about mom ?
george not know .
but ursula not recognise george even before george level her .
what ape think ?
either we should check the crate for pods , or she' s in some sort of hypnotic trance .
she doesn' t know who you are .
upon arrival , george whistled for shep to take them home .
hey , boy !
over here , boy !
come on !
come on , shep !
come on , shep !
come on , boy !
come on !
that' s a good boy .
shep !
see if you can spot our discreet product placement .
that' s my shep .
the elephant' s wearing new balance .
go , shep !
go !
go , boy !
that' s it !
i tell you , george , it' s good to be home .
maybe tookie wrong and mean lion not king .
jungle not look different .
not different ?
look at the signs , george !
the signs !
but george missed the signs .
signs even an illiterate warthog would' ve noticed .
because there was a big problem .
lyle' s maniacal machinery was moving ever closer to ape mountain .
meanwhile , the cowardly constituents scampered , as our fearless hero ran after them beseeching them to stand and fight .
don' t run !
if we work together , we can win .
george still king .
i' m the king !
you know you' re not the king .
you' ve had a narcissistic personality since you were a cub .
and there' s no reason that the rest of us should have to suffer for it .
if you really care about bukuvu , then better idea we have a bone crushing fight for kingdom afterwards .
when we still have kingdom .
what mean lion think ?
eat fur , jungle boy !
yes !
get him !
and they would' ve had their big , bone crushing fight for the kingdom had it not been for the trick ape taught him as kids .
the ear , george !
cool !
there .
see .
george wish life always this easy .
yeah , dad !
well done , george .
alright , who' s with george ?
why should we follow you ?
you care more about your family than us .
sure george care about family .
even half of family sleeping through best part of movie .
but you' ve always been george' s brothers and sisters .
don' t you remember ?
we took first steps together .
and you taught me how to swim .
and you were with me first time we read playape magazine .
so george beg you , not as king , but as brother , to join him and save homeland .
george ...
ok ?
ok , george try something completely different .
we few .
we happy few .
we band of brothers .
for he today that sheds his fur with george , shall be george' s brother .
and other animals shall think themselves cursed they were not here .
and when we get old , ye will remember with great pride what feats ye did today .
land all we have .
george king .
and king ask animals to join him and save homeland !
then , george fight alone .
feeling more alone than siegfried without roy , our dauntless , daring , defiant jungle gunslinger went out to save the bukuvu .
but soon his friends joined him .
like the magnificent seven , if they hadn' t been magnificent , and had consisted of a dim king , an elephant who thought he was a dog , an ape , a bird , a little monkey and a kangaroo .
they marched , flew and hopped out to meet the enemy .
and , just between you and me , ... it didn' t look good .
guess just us .
but luckily for george , after a delayed reaction to his insouciant iambic pentameter , the jungle' s vacillating varmints joined the fight with their potent potentate .
for those without a thesaurus ...
after a delayed reaction to his speech , the other animals joined the brouhaha with their king .
lmagining the cold steel of the deleterious ' dozers separating his upper half from his lower , he ordered his troops back in a slow and orderly retreat .
let' s go !
george realised the only way to win was to fight fire with ... coconuts ? !
so he called in the heavy artillery .
yes !
nice shooting !
oh , no !
not elephant zug zug !
good shot !
yeah !
with shep down , george felt the need to rally his troops .
don' t worry !
george not know meaning of word defeat !
not know meaning of most words , but especially defeat !
and george will stand here just as long as george' s name is ...
herb .
but herb , i mean george , quickly realised that a deadly ' dozer was heading to destroy the tree house and his still dozing wife .
george not hit women , so appreciate it if women not hit george .
george realise that to save tree house ,
bukuvu and entire jungle lifestyle , george now have to hit woman .
but , in name of sportsmanship , george give woman fighting chance .
note to george , rethink sportsmanship .
having finally defeated the pugnacious pair ,
indiana george found himself with an even bigger bugaboo , how to turn off the bulldozer ?
what this do ?
didn' t stop .
tree house .
not good .
move , animals !
junior ? !
george son swung !
we did it , dad .
we saved the jungle .
yeah !
can we join your little celebration ?
yes , it was ursula' s meddling , mendacious , mock mate , who , along with beatrice , had tracked her back to the bukuvu .
mom ?
lyle ?
ursula .
we' ve come to take my daughter and grandson home .
you' re not my father !
i was expecting that , that' s why i wore shin guards .
lngrowing toenail !
now , george , you may think you' ve won the war , but there' il be more bulldozers .
you give me back ursula and junior and i' il give you back the deed .
george love ursula and junior .
george , i' m sorry , it' s no use .
lyle' s my husband , junior and i should be with him .
i' m sorry .
that' s right .
take it easy , jungle head .
come along .
let' s go .
no !
don' t let lyle take me , dad .
i wanna stay with you .
alright .
ok !
tell ' em to back off , or mighty joe old gets it here .
george appreciate what gorillas do for george , but george not want anyone to die for him .
sound advice , doofus .
you' ve used your head for more than just cracking coconuts .
tell ' em to back off .
way off !
i want you to have this .
somehow , i think it belongs to you in this world .
oh , really .
must i be forced to endure this drivel ?
take ursula and junior and let' s get on with it .
no problem .
i' il get right on it .
ok .
thanks for watching my family for me .
what george do ?
george love animals and jungle , but more than anything , george love ursula and junior .
so what are you waiting for ?
get after them !
go on !
hey !
classic moment of western movie , where hero holds bad guy up in air , then humiliates with tree wedgie .
george !
george !
un wedgie me .
that was so nice .
george .
ursula know george ?
well , of course .
you' re my husband .
she know george !
as it turned out a kiss from george was stronger than any hypnotic spell .
hard to resist kiss from george .
would you take your hands off of my wife , please , whom you have unhypnotised .
i haven' t been this disappointed since sixth grade when my sister stole my shaun cassidy lunch box .
george confused .
shaun cassidy was a popular tv character in the late ' 70s along with parker stevenson .
i followed both their careers .
not confused about shaun cassidy .
george confused about unhypnotising .
would you like me to explain ?
sure .
that' s what i' m here for .
we' ve all been wondering about that .
let' s not start in , ok ?
i speak for everyone including the audience when i say this constant stream of annoying alliteration is annoying !
what are you gonna do about that ?
come on !
that hurts !
wait !
anyone else have any critiques or comments ?
good .
but before we can end our movie with the traditional jungle wedding scene ,
george still had one more official duty .
george !
helping ursula bring her friends out of their hypnotic trance .
george !
but i still don' t recognise him !
stan ?
stan ?
stan ?
is that you ?
stan ?
hello .
and you' re a big hairy ape .
yes !
so domestic bliss has once again returned to the bukuvu .
and with beatrice' s full blessing ,
george and ursula decided to renew their vows .
george want everyone to know , george no longer available all hours .
from nine to five , george belong to animals .
from five to nine , george belong to junior .
but at all times , george belong to ursula .
and ursula will wear neck crown .
because without his queen , george could not be king , or anything else .
jolly good .
so all' s well that ends well for that defender of the innocent , protector of the weak , and all around good guy , george of the jungle .
and now that george has learned to balance his time , he has vowed never to be late for lunch again .
lunchtime !
coming through !
go , dad !
hi , mom .

that' s my boy !
jungle surfing not so hard .
