i feel like saying it , so i do .
will i get a fever ?
maybe .
to be ...
to be ...
in other words ...
mr. godard' s room ? ... in order to abolish ignorance and crime , must i rage like a storm and sow evil at random ?

don' t you remember me ?
carmen .
you' re elizabeth' s daughter ?

young people are crazy !
they have great memories , but they forget anything !
they' re in a black hole .

what for ?
it' s quite empty , you know .
some friends and i are making a movie .

i don' t know .
so , is it yes ?
i' il lend you my new camera .
it makes music , i built it here ... ... with the kitchen staff .
don' t you want to go back to making movies , uncle jean ?

there' s tons of money to be made .
shall i ask my friend ?
let' s wait and see .
but can i borrow the apartment ?
who' il give me the keys ?
the gardener or his wife .
she does the cleaning .
you said it was empty .
so ?
i' il keep you posted .
he' s agreed .
it' s not a good idea .
it is .
we wanted perfect timing .
right .
but we' re improvising !
clara makes too many mistakes .
i' m aware of it .
i realize it , fully .
life isn' t the greatest good .
of all evils , mistakes are the worst .
hi claire .

hurry !
see you in the hall .
out of my way !
it must be more violent .
once more .
the tempo was a bit slack .
don' t fade so soon ...
the phrase on which you fade is very long ...
right .
act , don' t ask .
perform miracles , before you reveal them .
it' s the only way to fulfill your destiny .
let' s get out of here .
let' s leave .
i' il tie you up , it' il look more real .
the keys !

then i' il explain ...
there' s no rush .

you won' t go .
nothing' s lost .
wou' il write to me ?
and you ?
me ... ... actually i have no friends , male or female .
i know one girl , but she' s too special .
loneliness forced me to be my own best friend .
i really thought you wouldn' t untie me .
i haven' t had that kind of scare in ages .
you went to college ?
not really .
were your parents too poor , or didn' t you want to ?
they were too poor , and i didn' t want to go .
why ?
telling you why would take all day .
i have to figure myself out , first .

i get it .
jacques only hires college kids .
but i' il try ...
but then ... you' ve been a cop .
how else would we have met ?
that' s just it ...
you have a young girl' s behind ...
a woman' s too .

such violence is a kind of peace ...
ok , i' il tell you ... we' re going to kidnap a guy .
kidnap ?
yes , a wealthy businessman .
on fridays and saturdays he gambles here at the casino .
it' s either him , or his daughter .
why not both ?

then i thought of my uncle .
he' s a famous film director .
he' s all washed up now , he' s sick ...
i don' t know what' s wrong with him .
i visited him at the hospital .
i said we' d finance a movie for him .
he was in love with me when i was a kid ...

i think ...
i was his favourite relative .
he wanted me to be in his films .
but i didn' t want to .
lunch time .

if the bail' s high enough ...
you judges are a drag !
we bust our asses to find the guilty ones ...
they' il get him off .
where are you ?
to be or not to be ...
that' s not really a question .
does that woman really matter to you ?
something really strange ... almost taboo ...
a force propels me towards her ...
like the tide rushing in ...
it also goes out .
i' il help you .
will you let me ?
he will .
you can stay with us a few days .
