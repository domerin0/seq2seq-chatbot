our palaces are quite small .

didn' t we ?
you can' t remember whether you had lunch or not ?
anyway , let' s have something .
let' s go .
you should start painting again .
what ?
you should start painting again .
and what about you ?
i have a studio and i go there once a week .
and your brother , why doesn' t he trust you ?
he thinks there' s only one way to live , just his way .
nobody can get through to him .
i think i know what you mean .
no , you don' t , youngsoo .
no one can get through to him .
even though you know he' s wrong , it' s no use , no use .
i know what you mean .
excuse me , the toilet .
what' s the matter ?
it' s probably his stomach .
are you two close ?
i' ve known him for about 5 years .
we don' t get together often but we' re fond of each other .
he' s a very gentle person , this kid .
the way you talk about him , you seem very close .
what did i say ?
i' ve never seen you be nice to someone for this long .
what are you trying to say ?
what is her name ?
soojung .
her last name ?
yang .
can you please move ?
we' re shooting here .

hello .
what a coincidence !
hello .
you must be here with the crew .
yes .
can i see those gloves ?
these gloves ?
these gloves are really mine .
how did you get them ?
these gloves are yours ?
i found them on that bench .
i came back but ...
i didn' t think i would find them ...
i must have left them on the bench during lunch .
well , how lucky .
i can' t believe that you , soojung , brought them to me .
you remember my name .
of course .
do you remember my name by any chance ?
yes , of course .
i have a pretty good memory .
i have good memory , too .
well , i have to go .
it was nice meeting you again .
it was nice meeting you , too .
oh , i' m seeing youngsoo later on .
i see .
well , so long .
good bye .
and thank you for the gloves .
that' s alright .
the independent way is the way to make the best films .
the industry way isn' t right for me .
i' m ready to struggle .
then i can help out .
yes , of course .
but this is a bit embarrassing for me to talk about , isn' t it ?
you shouldn' t be .
it would be good if you could help .
it would be great if i help out , right ?
can you really ?
just direct as well as you paint , okay ?
it' il be great for me , too .
is this codfish ?
no way .
codfish wouldn' t be this cheap .
but isn' t this place called cod house ?
this is crayfish .
i have to go to the bathroom .
codfish isn' t so cheap .
new chopsticks , please !
they' re right here .
oh , there they are .
where did you get the chopsticks before ?
from there .
let me pour for you .
do you drink a lot ?
what ?
drinking ... do you drink a lot ?
yes .
i used to drink up to 5 bottles of soju , and 3 bottles of whiskey .
really ?
you drink that much ?
not anymore .
youngsoo , are you okay ?
are you going to sadang dong ?
youngsoo , get in .

i know it' s really cold , but it' il be fun .
what is it i' il enjoy ?
there' s this strange guy who lives with this girl ... it' s really funny .
come on .
they' re not here .
you' re really funny .
soojung ...
stop !
stop it !
i' m sorry .
are you hurt ?
no ...
i don' t know how you think about me , but i would really like to start a serious relationship .
but , we don' t know each other well .
i' m really serious .
i' m not just saying this .
if you can trust me , maybe you could start a relationship with me .
i' m asking for the last time .
no .
i see .
then , i should apologize .
i' m sorry .
please forgive me .
i will .
thank you .
i' il return this right after i' m back from location scouting .
sure .
are you sure i can borrow this ?
of course .
very nice ...
i should get one of these .
they' re not available in korea .
i bought this in japan .
you go to japan , right youngsoo ?
why would i go to japan ?
hey , park !
if you' re not going to shoot , why did we have to come so early in the morning and wait ?
if you think editing will take more time , you should have at least given us a call .
we' ve been here waiting from the break of done .
i thought the editing would be over by then .
we have to leave early if we want to save a day .
you should know that .
you always end up spending 3 days to edit , and you know it .
and you still make us come so bloody early in the morning .
come on , tell me when you' ve taken less than 3 days , huh ?
okay .
at least , buy us some lunch .
the crew have been waiting all day , you know .
let' s do it next time .
i have visitors today .
it' s 16 to 9 .
it' s my serve .
oh , don' t we have to check on the staff before they leave ?
okay .
we can do that now .
let' s quit playing .
you' re good .
why did you say you' re not good ?
i' m not good .
this isn' t funny .
why do you say you' re not good when you are ?
hello ?
hello , is this park ?
oh , kwon .
you didn' t come back so i left .
i told your assistant before i left ...
i don' t want to hear any of that .
so , are you coming tomorrow , or not ?
i waited the whole day today .
besides , something' s come up and i' m out of town tomorrow .
i don' t care what your plans are .
are you coming tomorrow , or not ?
we' re shooting tomorrow .
are you gonna be here , or not ?
what about driver kim ?
why should he come ?
he' s the boss ' driver , not the driver for the crew .
why would he come ?
you' re really not up to this job .
why don' t you just quit ?
okay .
you' re fired .
now you won' t have to come tomorrow .
satisfied ?
what ?
you , son of a bitch .
what' s that ?
bastard .
you better not move an inch .
stay right there , you bastard .
i' m sorry .
i' m really sorry .
you know how it is .
we' re always behind schedule .
so i was a bit tense , and i said some things i shouldn' t have .
i' m really sorry .
let' s shake hands and make up .
i' m sorry .
we don' t have to shake hands ...
i' m really sorry , park .
my mistake .
i shouldn' t have .
come on .
give me your hand .
is everything okay ?
are you okay ?
you know , one can' t do everything one wants in life .
this is pretty heavy .
you carry the camera in your pocket ?
i just put it in here a while ago .
how did it go with park ?
well , you know ...
i was too thoughtless .
it' s his job we' re talking about .
it was my temper , but it was my mistake .
my fault .
so is he coming tomorrow ?
oh , i forgot about that .
by the way , youngsoo , it only takes 30 minutes to recharge .
to sadang dong !
to sungbook dong .
yeah , you go .
soojung , get in .
i' il drop you off .
me ?
no , i' m fine .
it' s the opposite direction .
it' s okay .
it' il only be a slight detour .
bye youngsoo .
get in .
get in .
bye .
bye , youngsoo .
how about if i be your girlfriend only when you drink ?
would you ?
i liked that .
did you like it ?
i' il show you something .
when i was young , i used to stick my head out .
back then , my parents and i drove to the airport almost everyday .
on the way to the airport , my brother and i used to fool around ...
our car was a foreign car , too .
i guess we were well off , back then .
please , make yourself at home .
would you like something to drink ?
no thank you .
are you sure ?
yes .
excuse me while i take a shower .
would you like to take a shower ?
no , thank you .
just a second .
this is my first time .
what ?
i' ve never done this before .
really ?
yes .
i' ve never done this before .
really ?
i' m a virgin .
quite funny , isn' t it ?
no .
not at all .
isn' t it funny ?
you don' t like to wear a bra ?
i don' t like to in the winter , because it' s uncomfortable .
i see .
i guess in the winter , it doesn' t show .
excuse me .
can i get you anything else ?
i think we' re okay .
so it seems you come often these days .
that' s your car out there , right ?
yes .
it' s a very nice car .
well .
have a nice time .
it' s just a fork .
i would if i had a girlfriend .
i think you' re being too picky .
yeah , you' re too picky .
it' s not easy .
what' s not easy ?
well , you know .
i thought you were the simple type , but i guess not .
i guess i' m kind of chicken .
i think it' s in our family blood .
then how did your older brother manage ?
he and my sister in law go way back .
they met when she was in high school .
they went to the same church , and when she was in high school , he decided that she' s the one .
so we can say that he raised a child , then gobbled her up .
what ?
well , i think it' s fate and ...
i' il take her .
come on .
i think she might have been offended .
what do you mean ?
she also met her husband when she was in high school , remember ?
oh , right .
and i said that he raised a child , then gobbled her up .
she must really be offended .
oh , no .
anyway , happy birthday .
thanks for coming .
come on .
we' re in public .
to be frank , the type of woman that' s attracted to you , would probably be half crazy or decadent .
but , what you need is a woman that' s disciplined and secure .
that' s why it is very hard to find a right woman for you .
that' s enough .
no .
i mean it .
see , you wife here ...
someone' s at the door .
i' il get it .
okay .
long time no see .
jaehoon , you' re here .
hi .
the numbers of the apartment buildings are so mixed up .
come in .
come in .
she' s a writer and works with me .
hello .
come on in .
how come it' s so dark ?
where are the lights ?
in the back .
please sit down .
i' ve brought some baked sweet potatoes .
thank you .
so , it seems you' ve had quite a few drinks , already .
how have you been ?
fine .
what about dinner ?
this will do .
can you hand me the chopsticks .
try some of this .
youngsoo , how' s your movie coming along ?
going well ?
fuck .
why do you always have to call me by my name , youngsoo , when you never call their names when you talk to them ?
have you ever really cared about me ?
soojung , come here .
come over here .
move over , damn it .
come on .
get over here .
pour a drink for your boss , the producer .
come on .
youngsoo !
i' m just kidding .
get away .
soojung .
loosen up .
just enjoy yourself .
you don' t have to act so innocent .
drink up .
go with the flow .
drink up .
drink up .
drink up .
are you saying i didn' t drink ?
i did drink a lot .
you did ?
okay , then i' il drink this .
this is for me ?
he' s a thief .
how can he steal his own friend' s camera ?
you don' t know if he stole it ?
he said he lost it .
what do you mean he lost it ?
it' s so obvious .
just because there' s no proof , we can' t just forget about it .
it' s not obvious .
how funny .
how really funny .
soojung , so are you saying that he' s not a thief ?
we don' t know .
how can you ... okay .
producer kwon made a mistake .
he drank too much tonight , and he was out of line .
let' s just leave it at that .
are you saying that i' m accusing a completely innocent person ?
i' m not talking about him being drunk tonight .
i' m talking about his integrity .
his integrity .
you know !
he was out of line because he doesn' t know about us .
him not knowing has nothing to do with it .
what about him touching you , like your legs ?
is that also because he didn' t know about us ?
stop it !
we didn' t tell him , so it' s our fault , too .
funny .
very funny .
an innocent mistake because he didn' t know , huh !
soojung , are you in love with him or something ?
how very funny , mister !
was it so wrong for me to ask you to keep our relationship a secret ?
were you that offended ?
how can you not know how i feel about you ?
okay .
no , its not okay .
i don' t want our relationship to be taken as a fling .
i don' t want other people gossiping about us , either .
or him staring at us with a knowing eye .
this is really important to me .
you know ?
our relationship is .
alright , okay .
let' s just keep it between us .
soojung , you don' t know what i really want .
i really want our relationship to be really meaningful .
i' ve never felt like this before .
i was even considering marriage .
even marriage ...
how can you not know how i feel ?
me , to consider marriage .
do you know how hard it is for me to consider marriage ?
for me to consider ...
don' t make it difficult , then .
make your life easier .
let' s stop seeing each other , then .
why should we see each other if it has to be so difficult ?
am i wrong ?
soojung !
come here .
come here .
come here .
enjoy your meal .
can i see you today ?
i have to go somewhere today .
i see .
how are you ?
okay .
are you going somewhere far ?
no .
a friend has just moved to ansan , and invited some friends .
ansan ?
where' s ansan ?
it' s close if you take the subway .
she moved to kojan , which is right before ansan .
kojan ?
do you know how to get to kojan ?
look for yourself .
you look very nice in a skirt .
what is this ?
beethoven' s 6th symphony , " pastoral " .
oh , and thanks for this cd player .
not at all .
do you like it ?
my mother asked me who gave this to me .
is that so ?
i told her it was a gift , and she said it must be from someone who' s very generous .
is that so ?
is that how you hold your chopsticks ?
why ?
you' re supposed to hold one still so it doesn' t move .
then , hold the other one at the end of the three fingers .
like this ?
you move them back and forth with these two fingers .
very good .
if you' re not used to it yet , just do it your way , for now .
i should correct something if it' s wrong .
no .
why not ?
let' s do it next time .
again ?
i' m really getting tired of this .
let' s do it next time .
next time , when ?
this is all you want to do .
you got my breasts , didn' t you ?
i really want to do it .
let' s do it next time .
not today .
i' m having my period .
period ?
it doesn' t matter .
i don' t mind .
i do !
let' s do it when i' m clean .
are you really having your period ?
of course .
show me , then .
it' s true !
let' s go somewhere nice .

yes .
let' s go to cheju island .
