an eight year old boy from manhattan ... was delivered dead|on arrival today
the centers for disease control .
are we dealing with an epidemic ?
whatever the carrier, |we know that it' s not the water .
we don' t believe|that it' s airborne .
one , two , three , four
strickler' s disease|was first diagnosed two years ago .
we' re no better off now .
i needed you|to see this for yourself , dr. tyler .
it' s the same|at every hospital in the city .
for the lucky ones, |it' s a lifetime in leg braces .
most of these kids|won' t make it .
we need your help .
strickler' s disease|came to new york ...
like a thief in the night, |threatening to steal ... an entire generation of our children|from before our eyes .
dr. peter mann , deputy director|of the centers for disease control
the killer was cunning . |it was deadly .
neither a cure|nor a vaccine could be found .
we at the cdc|had to contain it ... before it could spread|beyond manhattan island .
so we went after its carrier, |the common cockroach .
or rather she did .
dr. susan tyler is the reason|that there hasn' t been ... a new case of strickler' s|in this city for six months .
dr. susan tyler .
dr. susan tyler, |professor of entomology ... at the new york state university .
thank you , peter .
i don' t think i need to tell you|new yorkers just how resilient ... the common cockroach is .
since it has proven to be|virtually immune to chemical control , we had to find|a new avenue of attack .
so , with the aid of genetics labs|across the country , we recombined termite and mantis dna|to create a biological counteragent , a new species to be|our six legged ally ... in wiping out|the roach population .
we call it|the " judas " breed .
once in contact with|the judas ' secretions , the common roaches|were infected with an enzyme ... which caused their metabolism|to go into overdrive . | come on , susan !
you' re missing it . | no matter how much|the common roaches ate , every last member|of the nest ... starved to death|within a matter of hours .
i hope someone' s taping this .
this announcement' s been|a long time coming ,
ladies and gentlemen . | coming home .
the strickler' s outbreak|has officially been contained .
the epidemic is over .
hey , susan . |honey .
any other questions ? | dr. mann , what did this victory|mean to you personally ?
it means that i can|move on to other projects with the , uh
our 15 minutes are gone .
and personally , um, |it' s where i met my wife .
what is this ?
is this|some kind of catholic guilt thing ?
we don' t even know|what the impact is of what we did .
the impact is that ... a lot of kids will be running around|next year because of you .
a lot of kids .
maybe we get lucky .
maybe a couple|of them' il be ours someday .
oh , a couple , huh ? | mm hmm .
oh , okay . |we' re not rushing things .
i didn' t want to overtax you . |it' s been a hard year .
it' s been a great year .
oxfords . |seven and a half .
black . |leather soles .
funny , funny shoes .
funny , funny shoes .
funny , funny shoes .
funny , funny shoes .
funny
cdc .
cdc .
hey , boss, |welcome to disease land .
tuck it in . | all right .
all right .
are you sure this is yellow fever ?
what , are you ignoring your pages now ? | listen , l
okay , these two cops|saw the broken scaffold, |and then the paint mess here .
and then they looked|through that cellar window .
go ahead . |take a look .
pleasant , isn' t it ?
couldn' t let ' em out|until you gave me the okay , so
roughly , there were|three dozen people trapped in here .
we got bacterial samples reading off|the scale , though nothing' s airborne .
we got a reverend harry ping .
preacher , if you can imagine that . |he ran this place .
well , there' s|no sign of him .
oh , have you had lunch ? | uh huh .
try to keep it down|when you see this , okay ?
piece of shit|on the ceiling .
hmm ?
figure that one out . | here you go , josh .
the subway ?
you know what ? l l |this is what i love about my job .
i get to travel, |see the world ... and meet new exotic cultures .
it' s it' s all bacterial, |but hey , what the fuck , right ?
thanks a lot , miguel . | board up every exit .
if this leads to the subways, |i don' t want anything to spread .
quarantine everything .
what' s going on , remy ?
oh , i' m just ... commemorating|my sad moments .
so , we' re at this|great restaurant .
i' m thinking , finally, |a fucking gentleman .
i go to the ladies ' room . |i come back .
i catch the schmuck slipping|a half ounce of sedatives into my drink .
what a pervert .
this city is full of perverts .
you don' t know who|anybody is anymore .
jesus , i look like shit . | hey , guys .
you the bug lady , right ?
we' re here to deal .
when you pick them up, |you should pick ' em up by|this front vein on the wing ,
' cause it' s the strongest part|of the wing .
see , that way|you don' t break it .
now , let' s see what else|you have in here .
oh , look .
what do we have here ? | swallowtail ?
excellent . | how come you like bugs so much ?
just imagine that|you' re one of them .
what , eating furniture and stuff ? |that' s gotta suck .
no , no , no . |now , don' t judge them too quickly .
these guys were building castles|while dinosaurs were still|wimpy little lizards .
now , say you' re him .
he' s what we call a soldier .
now , there is no way|that you would ever quit fighting , no matter how badly injured|you were .
it would be|a battle to the death .
but most insects don' t kill ... unless their territory is invaded .
you' d just stun|your prey up here .
and then you drag it|all the way down through here to there , into what is kind|of like a pantry .
will he eat it alive ?
yeah .
they' re not really squeamish|about those kind of things .
this is the nest . |it' s the heart of the colony .
the big enchilada .
why ? | well , if anything were|to happen to the nest , the entire colony|would die out .
i' d just bail and start my own .
well , you couldn' t do that .
see ... that big guy there ? |next to the queen ?
wait .
look over there .
he' s the king .
and out of all the nest, |he' s the only fertile male .
he got a good deal .
yeah .
it' s a simple structure|designed for their survival .
it' s perfectly balanced, |and it' s very beautiful .
whatever peels|your banana , lady .
so , you wanna buy|the butterflies , or what ?
you know what ?
you guys have done a really good job . |so , how about five bucks ?
that' s your best ?
i' m gonna show her the weird bug . | costs a dollar just to look .
it' s a really great bug . |got it on the subway .
we kind of broke it a little . | okay .
my best offer .
ten bucks for everything, |plus a specimen jar, |some tweezers and some mounts .
deal .
are you crazy ?
this is the best . |this is our meal ticket .
come on . |bug' s almost dead anyway .
it' s yours .
you gave ' em ten bucks . | they' re from alphabet city .
there' s much worse things|they could be selling .
oh , no .
your papers . |help me get the window .
susan .
push . h , come on . | oh , i hate this window .
okay , on three . |one , two , three .
who the hell do you think you are , putting my two officers|on quarantine ?
listen to me , captain . |those two , they go home , they kiss their wives, |they kiss their kids , and i' m the one with|a full blown epidemic
come on , chuy .
we have to make dinner .
dinner . |i don' t care .
i do care ! |jesus , god , i hate cops .
they make the worst coffee .
shiny wire . |still giving you a hard time ?
as always . | don' t stare . |people look back if you stare .
it' s not polite .
i can' t believe this . | what ?
i spend an hour in the field . |i get a weekend' s worth of crap .
oh , speaking of that . |that turd that i took to the lab ?
i found these in it .
what are they ?
buttons . | buttons ?
maybe they needed fiber .
sorry .
wow .
oh , my god . |you' re just a baby .
oh , my god .
the transfer|of recombinant genetic material ... from termites and mantis|into judas breed will allow|rapid enzymatic change ... insuring 100 % sterility|in all judas females ... utilization|of a suicide gene ... leading to a life expectancy|of 120 to 180 days .
hmm .
not too little ... and not too much .
you rub it in .
around and around .
like this , huh ?
let the leather take it .
funny shoes .
aieee . |mr .
funny shoes .
no one is there .
it' s empty .
chuy , listen to me .
they have jesus|on the cross , but that is not|a holy place .
can you call me back tonight ?
thanks , officer .
cops are on it .
good .
well , they said
can you do me a favor and hold off|working at night for awhile ?
i can' t do that .
i was actually|thinking i had to get back
susan , someone broke into|your office , okay ?
i' m sorry about you losing a specimen , but let' s try and get|our priorities straight . | this is not just a specimen .
i did a ph test, |and there are only two species ... that match what i found .
now , one of them|is a leaf cutter ant in the amazon .
the other one|we released here three years ago .
you said
y y you said the ones we released|only had a life span of six months .
we engineered them|to be sterile adults .
the judases were not supposed to last|past one generation .
so what happened ? | the one i examined today was a baby .
they were designed to die . |they are breeding .
i shine them good .
chuy , black lincoln . |chuy ?
black lincoln . |this one .
chuy , pay attention , please .
this is where|you found the bug ?
yeah , man . |but they changed the lock .
you sure you haven' t|seen one of those ?
no .
what is it ?
it' s an ootheca .
it' s kind of|a fancy name for an egg case .
there' s probably more, |like , weird bugs inside of it .
no way . |i see one of those , i puke .
here you go .
here . | hold on .
is there money to be made|on this egg thing ?
sorry . | dealing days are over .
vamonos .
these egg things look nasty .
thought you liked|finding nasty things .
well , what if we go find these things . |she' il pay us , right ?
is that all you think about ?
come on .
this bug . |what does it look like ?
did you hear that ?
how deep does this go ? | let' s see .
let' s take a look .
you see anything ? | not yet .
shit .
i dropped it .
i can' t reach it .
let me try . |my hands are smaller .
just leave it . | well , no .
wait . |i think i' m almost there .
how much you think the bug lady' il|give us for this egg thing ?
at least a 20 spot .
jesus !
fucking moles !
hey !
got any change ? | get a job , scag .
hey , kid ! |get the hell off the tracks !
hey , how about a quarter ? | get off my tracks ! |that' s where he is .
long john . |that' s where he is .
long john .
don' t be talking to the moles .
they messed up . | hey , moles !
eat my long john !
look , i already told you|this is cdc business .
and i' m telling you that|those lockers are mta business .
okay , we' il we' il pay for the lock|that we broke , officer .
i mean , whatever we can do | lady , who am i talking to now ?
you or him ? | you' re talking to me , okay ? |you' re talking to me .
all we wanna see is
see what ?
that' s|the old maintenance bridge , buddy .
this insect|that we are looking for
look , man .
your lady want a bug ... or it' s eggs , or whatever she wants, |that' s fine by me .
but it' s like|swiss cheese down there .
tunnels in , tunnels out, |old tracks .
you go messing around , break your neck, |and it' s my ass on the line .
lace up shoes .
black .
nine west .
chuy , finish your sandwich .
it' s good . |it' s chicken .
penny loafers .
eleven .
double e.

he doesn' t need school .
he' s special .
what you making there ? |is that a superhero ?
mr. funny shoes .

uptown .

napoleon is alive and well|and working for the mta .
we have to get down there .
he wants a permit ? |i' il give him a real special one .
ah , what' s that ?
is that the egg thing ?
give me a hand .
oh , man , that smells .
i can hear the bugs inside .

i think there' s|a guy down there .
oh , shit .
oh , shit ! |it' s got me !

oh , god , please ! |please , help me !
alex !
a philosopher named hobbes|once wrote that ,
life , by its very nature, |is nasty , brutish and short .
can i eat it|or will it eat me ?
it' s this kind of simplicity ... that governs the phylum insecta .
hello ?
it' s me .
i got the permits . | you did ?
we' re going down|first thing tomorrow . | okay , that' s great .
listen , honey , i i gotta go right now . |i' il call you later . ... or of cellular phones, | okay . as my distinguished colleague|can tell you .
so , you think your little frankenstein|has got the better of you ?
i was hoping|you could tell me .
i really need to find|some answers , walter .
dear susan , is it answers you want from me, |or is it absolution ?
you still think|making the judases was wrong ?
three years ago, |i would' ve called it unforgivable .
but i have two grandchildren who are|alive today probably because of you .
it would be a tad hypocritical ... for me to pass judgement .
that' s not an answer , walter .
it' s not an easy question .
but as to the judases ,
i think it' s likely|some survived .
evolution has a way|of keeping things alive .
but they all died in the lab .
yes , susan . |but you let them out ... into the world .
the world' s a much bigger lab .
funny shoes .
yeah . | hi , peter .
it' s remy .
yeah , hi . | is susan there ?
i need to talk to her .
how you doin ' ? | fine .
huh ? | it' s really important .
yeah , sure .
what are you doing ?
what do you got there ?
where ? | right down there .
in your hand .
nothing . | oh , are we testing it ?
maybe . | mm hmm .
are we testing it ? | uh huh , maybe . |i don' t know .
could be .
it' s remy . | oh , good .
okay .
so give me the phone .
come on .
come here .
give me the phone .
are we testing it ? |can you hold on , remy ? | yes .
hey .
what' s up ?
they found what ? | at the water filtration plant .
what' s going on ? | okay , i' il be there in, |in about 20 minutes .
okay .
bye . | okay .
bye .
how long you got ?
patience .
we' il just try again .
try again .
you know , sometimes these things|can be wrong .
that' s okay . |i gotta go , okay ?
bye , babe .
susan , we got|the subway thing today .
yeah , i know .
i i' m just gonna have|to meet you there when i' m done .
wait .
when you' re done from what ?
uh , boots , toys , uh , beer bottles , body parts, |cocaine filled condoms , uh , little baby alligators .
shit , you wouldn' t believe|the stuff i' d seen .
yep .
they flush ' em down . |we fish ' em out .
but this thing . |we didn' t know what this was .
we were thinking about throwing it away, |but then i remembered remy .
jeremy plays bass in my band .
ah . | anyway .
so , uh
yep .
i remember|remy says to me ,
if it' s got more than four legs, |it' s not a mammal .
it' s a lobster , right ?
my father saw me stay in bed , he' d go get the pitcher|of cold water , and whoosh !
i tell you, |that' s some alarm clock .
wow .
how big did you say these bugs are ? | come on .
hurry up .
you know , my shift' s almost over . |i need my beauty sleep .
man , if i' m blowing off|my saturday , then so are you .
yeah .
it looks like somebody|requested you for overtime .
come on .
hurry up . |let' s find these things .
we' ve got a long way to go .
all right . |watch your step there .
we' ve got burrows going|down seven stories here .
no shit ? | oh , yeah .
it' s five stories down , partner .
you fall , i don' t wanna|come back and pick you up .
okay , it' s all yours . |go ahead .
it' s 48 hours anyway . |i can' t wait that long .
it' s 48 hours .
now listen, |you got something to write with ?
yes , yes .
i write it . | you gotta write this down .
come on .
here' s the case number . |it' s two seven
wait a sec .
two , seven . |yes , two seven
eight three . | eight three .
all right .

yeah , man . |the mole people .
this section was pretty popular|all the way to fulton street .
tweeked out crackheads, |dopeheads , shitheads , mental cases .
then suddenly , poof ! |all gone .
rumors got started . |someone found a couple of stiffs .
yeah , they make up|some crap about a killer .
overcoat slim , long john .
now , down here is the land of talk .
the wildest version|goes the farthest .
hold it right here . |you got it ?
i see
what' s this ?
look !
the organs are ... |perfectly formed .
they were functional .
i' m guessing here, |and , of course , they don' t have a , uh, |a complete specimen , but
what do you think it is ?
this thing ... |is not just some random mutation .
it' s a highly evolved|soldier caste , formidable killer .
it couldn' t have developed|in a vacuum .
it' s part of a colony .
this way , this way .
should have stayed|at the office .
how much longer do we have to go ? | keep looking around .
it' s the size of your palm .
aw , man .
take a whiff .
god , it smells like acid . | no .
it' s ammonia .
hey , guys .
huh ?
there' s some weird shit here .
what kind of weird shit ?
lots of it .
god !
man !
go ahead and ask him .
ask .
what the you seen anything|like this before ?
why' re you asking me if i' ve ever seen|some shit like this before ?
do i look like i' ve seen|some shit like this before ?
hell , no , i ain' t never seen|no shit like this before !
who the fuck would wanna climb up|these walls and hang one of these ?
must' ve been a big|elephant ass motherfucker . |i don' t know who the fuck

i' m not gonna spend my life|looking into people' s open mouths .
what could be worse|than that , right ?
oh , man, |i' ve never been this deep .
this is the old|armory station .
hey , they built it|around the turn of the century .
it' s been closed for decades .
yeah , i guess we covered everything . | hey , look .
you got your shit . |i' m happy for you .
let' s get the hell|outta here , huh ?

wait a second . |i can' t find my way back alone .
look , look , look . |just go back the same way we came .

close the door !
close the fuckin ' door !
what the fuck was that ?
come on .
here .
here , here , here ! | just wait a minute !
fuck it !
you wait a minute ! |i wanna make sure ! | it' s not dead .
yeah , well , it' s gonna be ! |very soon , lady !
there it is . |drag it out .

everything' s gonna be okay .
ah , christ .
josh will be here soon . |he' il bring us some help . | you' re dreamin ' , man .
if your boy was comin ' back, |he' d have been here by now .
they got his ass , man . |they ate his ass , man . | we don' t know that .
and if you think there' s not|another one of those things out there , what has been puttin' |that shit all over the walls ?
listen , leonard . |if you keep on screaming like that , we' re gonna meet|the rest of its family .
manny ? |manny , be careful .
it it' s dead . | no , no , no .
i emptied two clips|into that thing and it kept comin ' .
wait , wait a second . |help me turn it over .
peter , these are lungs .
what the hell is she talkin ' about ?
biology 101 .
you know, |insects don' t have lungs .
that' s what limits their size . | the secretions are the same .
oh , god
when i increased|the judas' s metabolism , i must|have sped up its breeding cycle .
i mean , we' re talking tens, |hundreds of thousands of generations .
i mean , who knows how many mutations . | listen , l
i just don' t fuckin ' get this . |how could the
how could the judas|evolve into this ?
think generations , not years , okay ?
it took only 40, 000 generations|for apes to turn into humans . | so ?
we changed its dna , peter . |i mean , we don' t know what we did !
wait a minute !
wait a minute ! |wait a minute !
hold on !
if that thing has|been around , how come |how come nobody' s ever seen it ?
i think we have .
sometimes an insect will evolve|to mimic its predator .
a fly can look like a spider .
a caterpillar|can look like a snake .
the judas evolved|to mimic its predator .
us .
nobody up there knows about this ?
nobody would . |not until it' s too late .
these things can imitate us .
they can infiltrate us|and breed a legion before|anyone would even notice .
how |how could you do this ?
how |how could you do this ?
you you take something|and you you make it like a man .
a man who' s not a man , he' s a | manny !
he' s a thing ! | manny !
that steals my child !
manny , you tell her, |' cause she don' t give a goddamn . | hey , hey , hey .
your kid' s gone . | hey , shut up .
my leg' s chewed up all over ! | shut up , will ya ?
shut the fuck up !
and they' re both talkin' |about insects with lungs ! | shut up !
oh , shit ! |they' re everywhere !
manny , get over here !
it' s the blood !
the smell of the blood|is driving them crazy ! | oh , shit !
we have to cover the scent !
manny , give me your razor . |give me your razor !
here .
take it . |rub it on the windows .
anywhere where there' s cracks . | wha
just do it ! | what ?
oh !
what the |ah !
what is it ?
scent glands .
insects use them|to identify themselves .
here .
rub it|all over yourself .
they won' t attack you|if they think you' re one of them .
manny !
it worked .
do you mind if
go ahead .
manny , give me your lighter .
look . |this is where we are .
now , these tunnels|may lead to the surface .
yes . | if we can get ... this car moving, |we might be able to make it .
what
what do you mean , might ?
i mean , probably .
but even if they do , th this thing' s been down here|rotting for half a century .
how do you know it' il move ? | listen to me .
listen .
this car is a cr 17|from coney island .
believe me , it was made to last .
now , manny , there' s a track relay switch|in this room here .
you switch the tracks . |that' il get us going . | yes , i' il try .
i' il try . | do .
there' s a fuse box|down the tracks .
if i can rewire it, |i can juice up the whole system .
leonard , man .
look at yourself , l | i' il do it .
hey , if you talk me through it, |i' il go out there . | all you' ve gotta do is
no , no , no , no . |i' il go .
i' il go .
why ?
i know much more about|what' s out there than you do .
you' re right .
you understand the creature , and , uh ,
leonard knows the subway , so so this is the way|it' s gotta be .
whatever happens , it' s manny and me . | why ?
you two have gotta stay on this car .
you gotta get back up .
you gotta undo this .
so , i' il go .
we' il go .
