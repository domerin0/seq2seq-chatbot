in the year 2026
archaeologists working in the nevada desert discovered a portal to an ancient city on mars
they called this portal the arc
20 years later we are still struggling to understand why it was built
and what happened to the civilization that built it .

why we gotta come all this way ?
why can' t the hire the cops to do this bullshit ?
is it that always that rough ?
believe me , it used to be a lot rougher .
there was a time when ark travel was susceptible to , let s say , major turbulence .
what does he mean ?
he means , he went to one galaxy , his ass went to another .
call it a scientific miscalculation .
unbelievable as it may seem ...
uac does make the odd tiny mistake .
marcus pinzerowsky , you call me pinky .
follow me .
where are the personnel who aren t locked down in the lab ?
in the atrium .
pinky , put us up .
activating remote personal surveillance .
circle up , men .

men on me , let' s move out .
open the doors .
who call in the military ?
dad , look !
where the fuck are we over here ?
couple of million light years from breakfast .
when can i start evacuating people out through the ark ?
we re at level 5 quarantine , nobody goes anywhere .
ladies ...
we re under a level 5 quarantine so i m just gonna have to strip searching girls .

portman !
sargent , this is doctor samantha grimm .
the uac science officer assigned to retrieve data from the lab .
sargent .
dr. grimm .
hello john .
hello samantha .
hello samantha !
sarge , this operation is a code red .
we really don t have room for passengers .
excuse me , but i have orders to retrieve data from three service .
anthropology , forensic arkhaeology and genetics .
this is a military operation , doctor .
we re really not here to retrieve your science homework .
ok , i ve got and idea .
why don t you ask your co what your orders are ?
to contain and neutralize the threats , to protect the civilians and retrieve ... retrieve uac property .
we' re finally done here ?
because i ve got a job to do .
if you follow me
you chose this reaper .
is this going to spoil my day ?
no , sir .
please tell me you didn' t let a fine piece of ass like that get away from you , reaper .
she s my sister .
no shit !
don' t do this again , man .
do what ?
there s three sections to carmack s lab complex .
arkhaeology , genetics and weapons research .
you test weapons out here ?
well , it s a dead planet .
you can test it here where is safe or in your own backyard .
we are primarily an arkheological operation , weapons research is in it' s own separate facility ... ... it has nothing to do with dr. carmack s work .
how many inside when the lab shut down ?
only doctor carmack s team , that' s 6 people .
in one of the carbon dating labs there was an internal phone left off the hook .
did you get any information from there ?
open the door .
portman , goat , lead on .
magnesium , chromium , lead , it s all normal .
all clear !
pinky , give us a schematic .
uploading to you now .
<i>carmack s lab is isolated from the rest of the facility . </ i>
<i>the airlock is the only way in or out . </ i>
goat , portman genetics .
kid , destroyer carmack s office where they sent the mayday from .
reaper keep doctor grimm safe on her salvage job .
duke and i il take the weapons lab and make sure that all hardware is secured .
be safe , gentlemen .

clear right .
five bucks this shit ain' t nothing but a scrambled employed with a gun .

they re on the move .
you don t look like a mac .
katsuhiko kumanosuke takahashi .
so , mac .
what the fuck ?
<i> pinky , how are getting us ?
jesus , very cool . </ i>
cleared .
where the hell is everybody ?
hey !
lock it .
it s clear .
how much time you re gonna need ?
30 minutes , tops .
<i>goat , portman ... there' s another room to the north .
past genetics . </ i>
copy that .
what the hell is that ?
you never did time , portman ?
what ?
this is a holding cell .
bullshit .
what makes you think that ?
touch it .
cause the walls are electrified .
you asshole .
geez !
if they left shit like this going around ?
i want to see what they lock up .
bfg
hey , sarge what s the deal with the sister ?
reaper s parents are the first team of arkhaeologists to olduvai .
they died on some accident when he was a kid .
she followed in their footsteps and he didn t .
no , what i meant was is she single ?
<i>please provide dna verification . </ i>
<i>access denied . </ i>
so , reaper , as in grimm .
are marines sam , not poets .
holly shit !
oh , yeah meet lucy .
lucy , this is my brother john another creature from the long lost past .
you found human remains humanoid .
lucy and her child are our first major find .
we re bringing up more everyday .
you reopened the dig .
i know i should ve told you .
i didn t figure this is a thing i can judge down on a yearly birthday card .
it s been stabilized .
bullshit !
you wanna talk about safe , like you took a desk job ?
i m a forensic arkheologist , john , i go where the work is .
is that the only reason you are up here ?
wanna know why i m up here ?
i il show you , come here .
this is lucy s chromosome profile .
notice anything ?
my molecular genetics is a little rusty .
what' s the first thing dad taught us to look for ?
she' s got 24 pairs of chromosomes .
humans only have 23 .
what the other extra pair do ?
makes her superhuman .
the extra pair makes her super strong , super fit , super intelligent .
her cells divide 50 times faster meaning she heals almost instantly .
fosile records indicates these people haven' t conquered diseases .
we found no genetic disorders , no viruses , no cancers .
so , what ?
they re just naturally superiors .
no , no naturally .
see , the earliest remains we found only had 23 .
we suspect this extra chromosome maybe is synthetic .
bioengineered .
it s a long word for a marine .
has it ever bothered you , you could ve spent your life with a microscope instead of a sniper scope ?
if they were so smart , how come are so dead ?
we don t know .
maybe there' s one with time .
you don t shield a baby from time .
<i>we have movement up ahead . </ i>
you stay here , ok ?
lock the door .
the fucking door has been ripped open .
there s something in carmack s office .
there !
contact !
move in to carmack s office !
fast !
contact !
moving fast !
hold your fire !
if you have a weapon , drop it .
don' t move !
sam , i told you to  he knows me , john .
dr. carmack it s me , samantha .

where are they ?
steve , hillary i m not gonna hurt you .
i m not gonna hurt you .
oh , jesus christ .
oh , damn !
get a medkit .
oh , nice .
i m not gonna hurt you .
duke , get him to the infirmary with dr. grimm .
portman , kid ... go to the airlock and dig in .
anything trying to get away from us will get driven straight to you .
now , let s see if we can find the body that goes with that arm .
he' s messed up , huh ?
a guy like carmack is trained to put logic before emotions ?
he' s so freaked , uh ?
he tears off his own ear ?
i tell you ... it' s shit like that gets to you , kiddo .
do you have ... ?
do you have any ?
do i have any ?
yeah .
what ?
you know .
i m just a little shocked about it .
i need something to get my focus .

oh , god .
have you found anything like this in your archealogical digs ?
no .
is there any way this thing came from the outside , from the surface ?
the planet is completely dead .
it came from somewhere , lady !
portman , shut up .
the atmosphere on the surface can' t support life .
maybe it doesn' t need air .
it could have come from another planet or something .
what ?
like an alien ?
look at that thing !
portman , you need to shut the fuck up !
that' s not what we saw .
that' s not what goat and i shot at in genetics .
you are telling me there are more of these fucking things ?
where are the surface entry points ?
there' s a pressure door at the end of the north corridor .
destroyer , you , kid and portman get there in a double .
give me an update .
yes , sir .
whatever this thing is ... ... i cannot get back to the ark !
mac , i want you to arm pinky with a weapon ... ... with some st grenades and seal the ark door .
there' s one other door .
where ?

goat' s .
he killed himself .
what you mean he killed himself ?
he was already dead !
it' s true .
he' s dod .
was turning into one of these motherfuckes and killed himself !
we found two more scientists at the dig .
thurman and a baldy guy with glasses .
dr. clay .
did you check their necks ?
were there open wounds on their necks ?
we were conducting a firefight not an autopsy .
we came up here ... ... to find 6 scientists .
four are known dead ... ... and dr. willits is probably kai somewhere down in that sewer .
the only one missing is dr. carmack .
has dr. carmack showed up yet ?
i wish he' d not , allright ?
look at the left ear .
son of a bitch !
i think this other one is steve willits .
and i ran the dna to check it against his med records .
what are you people working on up here ?
we' re analyzing bones ... ... artifacts .
we' re not doing anything like this !
then , what the fuck is that ? !
must be a genecit mutation .
something enviromental or viral .
i don' t know .
and may even be reversible .
it' s irreversible .
not necessarily .
dr. carmack' s condition is irreversible .
because dr. carmack' s condition is that !
he' s dead .
kid , you and duke get back to the dig and you make sure those other dead scientists ... ... are really dead .
i' ve lost four soldiers .
what are you people experimenting with up here ?
i' m not gonna ask you again .
i told you .
it' s an arkheologycal research center .
you think i' m lying to you .
is that what you' re saying ?
you think i' m hidding something ?
i' m telling the truth .
what were you downloading ?
what were you sent to protect ?
the research data !
research into what ?
<i>subject was injected with study agent at 003 . </ i>
<i>vitals normal ... </ i> <i> ... elevated heart rate , attributable to subject anxiety . </ i>
<i>c24 sucessfully grafted to subject' s macro cells at 009 . </ i>

jesus christ , dont you get it ?

why did it take goat and not destroyer ?
why carmack and not dr. thurman ?
what ?
lucy had the 24th chromosome , but she wasn' t a monster .
she died protecting her child , not devoring it .
why did the same chromosome that made her superhuman turned stall into a monster ?

then give me 10 seconds .
this is its tongue .
this , is brain matter from portman .

it' s choosing who to infect .
choosing ?
how is it choosing ?
there genetic are markers for psychotic and violent behavior .
it could be a specific neurotransmitter is picking up on .
a ganglion , latching on to numbers in the dna code link .
a link to what ?
evil ?
10 percent of the human genoma still unmapped .
some say is the genetic blueprint for the soul .
maybe c24 is what destroyed the population .
it would explain why someone had to build the ark to escape to a new beginning .
some may made superhuman ... ... others monsters .
oh , my god .
we gotta get out of here .
now !
come on !
let' s go !
people quarantined at the other side of the ark , they won' t be all infected .
what' s going on ?
sarge is gonna kill' em all .
come on !
we' re pulling quarantine , nothing gets to the elevator back on earth .
we cannot let them get to the surface .
if it breaths , kill it .

put the hand in the air ?
why do you stand there , you dumb son of a bitch .
help me up !
it' s okay .
please , help us .
you don' t have to kill all of them .
i don' t think everyone is infected or even capable of being infected .
we' ve orders to contain this threat by any means necessary .
so , let' s evacuate the uninfected and blow this place to hell .
and we have orders to protect this facility .
i don' t have orders to kill innocent people .
we have to stop anything from getting to the surface .
by any means necessary .
found this little chickenshit hidden in a pile of dead bodies .
and i' m glad to see you , guys .
that thing came right through the door .
i tried to use the grenade but it came at me too fast .
followed me through the ark and started kill everybody .
it' s horrible .
there' s no wound on his neck .
he' s clean .
i' il say who is clean ... ... and who is not .
it wasn' t my fault !
hey , i' m not a soldier !
you shouldn' t left me there .
sarge !
there' s a storeroom to the south .
it' s got like 20 people hold up inside of it .
we gotta do something .
your orders were to clear that sector .
is it cleared ?
no , i told' em to stay put .
they' re okay .
they' re just scared shedders .
we kill' em all .
let god sort' em out .
this is wrong ...
son , you don' t think !
that' s an order .
we' re in the field , soldier !
sarge , if nothing' s found  you will ... ... obbey the direct order ... ... of your commanding officer .
no .
now !
go to hell .
no !
holy shit !
minus insurrection is punishable ... by death .
it was his first mission !
it' s not gonna be my last !
i need soldiers !
i don' t need anybody else but soldiers !
throw your weapons !
i mean it !
i have no intentions of being killed by a madman .
drop your weapons !
there' s something behind me , isn' t it ?
