end of transmission .
that' s the best show i ever did .
major dallas has the five elements on board ... and the priest is guiding them to the temple .
we' re saved .
the diva said i should take care of you .
humans act so strange .
what do you mean ?
everything you created ... is used to destroy .
we call it human nature .
you learn that on your screen ?
i' m not finished yet .
i' m up to " v.
v " is good .
some good words in " v.
like what ?
valiant .
vulnerable .
very beautiful .
oh , of course , munro !
mr. president ?
now what ?
we have a problem .
it' s advancing ?
it' s not only advancing , it' s moving at incredible speed .
and do you have any idea where it' s heading ?
korben , there' s a general on the phone .
i' il give you the president .
major dallas , i first would like to salute a warrior .
you' re a shining example of this army .
in the name of the federation
any idea when you' il get to the point ?
a ball of fire 1 , 200 miles in diameter heading straight for earth ... and we have no idea how to stop it .
that' s the problem .
how much time do we have ?
if its speed remains constant , in an hour and 57 minutes .
i' il call you back in two hours .
hello ?
they just landed in the desert .
good job , david .
put her in the center .
where ?
here ?
you got it figured out , father ?
this one should be fire .
you know how this works ?
theoretically .
the four stones should go around .
the fifth element should be in the middle ... and then the weapon against evil should work .
you' ve never seen this work ?
give me that .
every weapon has a manual .
i' m sure this has one too .
that' s it .
that' s it .
match up the symbols .
go !
go !
wind .
my man , what you doing ?
what ?
what you doing ?
trying to keep you in the d. j. business .
fire .
done .
what happens ?
so , now , we have to open them .
and you know how to do that .
right ?
theoretically ...
no .
leeloo , honey , wake up .
you have to help us .
how do you open the stones ?
wind blows .
fire burns .
yes , i know all that .
but how do you open these stones ?
rain ...
falls .
what does it mean ?
i think that
maybe it' s a charade .
a game or something .
if we don' t get these stones open in five minutes , we' re dead .
dead ?
yes , dead .
too late .
we' ve lost contact with them .
three minutes .
i think mine is broken .
why i gotta get the broke one ?
we' re never gonna make it .
it moved .
show me what you did .
nothing .
shut up , shut up !
show me what you did , step by step .
i was standing here .
quickly .
i put my hands on the top like this , and i said ...
we' re not going to make it .
and that' s it ?
korben , my man .
wind .
she said , " wind blows .
everyone take a stone .
water for water .
fire for fire .
earth for earth .
go !
earth .
open the other one .
korben , my man , i have no fire .
i have no matches .
do you have any ?
i stopped smoking .
father , you smoke ?
got some matches ?
we need some fire .
we' re going to die .
don' t breathe .
fire .
one minute .
let' s go , leeloo .
wake up .
wake up .
it' s time for you to work now .
protect life ... until death .
listen to me !
listen to me .
listen , i know you' re very tired .
i' il take you on vacation .
a real vacation, just you and me .
but if you don' t do something right now ... we' il all die .
what' s the use of saving life when you see what you do with it ?
it' il enter the atmosphere in 40 seconds .
you' re right .
you' re right .
there are some things ... very nice things worth saving ; beautiful things .
beautiful things .
like love ?
yes , love .
that' s good .
that' s good .
that' s a good example .
love is worth saving .
i don' t know love .
i don' t know love .
i was built to protect , not love .
so there' s no use for me other than this .
you' re wrong .
you' re wrong .
you' re wrong .
i need you .
i need you , very much .
why ?
because ... because ...
tell her , korben .
tell me .
please .
why you need me ?
because ...
tell me .
tell me .
because i
because i love you .
i love you .
1 0 ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 , 5 ... 4 , 3 ... 2 ... 1 .

i' il throw myself in traffic .
i' il saran wrap myself to the bed .
