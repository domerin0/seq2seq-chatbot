i think she' s my girlfriend but what she thinks ...
here you go
you and i seem to have a lot in common
lemon peel angel , kurt cobain , too .

so i decided to give him just one more chance .

dongsuk , what was your childhood dream ?
a magician huh ?
a beautiful woman is trapped in a big aquarium , and i rescue her with a scarf .

one second
what is it ?
oh , it' s nothing
what ?
a friend sent me a message
let me see
congrats on your ancient 29th birthday
eat well , live well .
jjung
today' s your birthday ?
yes
then you should be getting presents , not me .
your magic is more than enough
on a day like today you should be with someone you love , not me ...
don' t you have a boyfriend , aeryun ?
no
that' s strange .
a woman like you ...
men have their eyes on backwards
swoosh , he' il be at my side .
this is practically a jail
did the owner go somewhere ?
yes , she did
i wanted to see a good movie ...
congratulations thank you
can i keep this ?
of course
what you want for a present ?
come close to me take my hand
don' t leave me alone anymore
another me trapped inside myself
today , i wait ... for you again
though i am happier waiting for you than being with you , watch me , i am getting tired .
take my hand
if i could love you , as if we' ve met for the first time ,
i want to say i love you , as if for the last time .
hold out your hand and capture me
comfort my weary soul
the other me inside myself cannot withstand , day by day .
waiting for the warm touch of your hand .
your song is really great when does the album come out ?
well ...
when the time is right
for a while it seemed like it would happen , but it didn' t .
then it really seemed likely , but it fell through .
i have high hopes this time , but i don' t know .
someone out there will discover your music .
hang in there
it' s always hard to be true to yourself .
come close to me take my hand
don' t leave me alone anymore
another me trapped inside myself
today , i wait for you again .
though i am happier waiting for you ...
i' m so touched .
what' s the occasion ?
you' ve grown soft to be touched by so little
why the watch ?
oh , it was a present
guess you' il be keeping time now
there' s nothing recent
aeryun picked some tapes to help me work .
aeryun ?
i said before ,
lemon peel angel .
oh , lemon peel angel .
good work sure
let' s go to my office
the songs ... did you sing all of them ?
yes
the songs are quite usable
thank you
these days i manage a young entertainer .
ah , he sings well .
and ... his looks aren' t bad
excuse me ?
nowadays you need more than just a good voice .
well , i' m packaging him as a songwriter and performer ...
so what you' re trying to say is ... the fellow you' re managing , let him have my songs ?
well , in other words , yes .
the client' s chest is a bit dry , so moisturize it with breast cream .
use suction and concentrate it there
okay
hello ?
thank you .
olivia elfoulage .
how' s that ?
comfortable ?
yes
excuse me , telephone for you
don' t be too dejected you' ve held on this far
easygoing , enjoyable , if it' s beautiful , better still ...
that' s how i see my music
but i keep hitting a wall
don' t grow weak on me i believe in you
of course , you' re stubborn .
and when you fix onto something ,
you don' t let go
you get hurt by little things
maybe that' s why i like you
let' s get married first
i' d like for you to focus on your music in a stable environment .
i don' t like you seeing this side of me .
i don' t want to say thanks or sorry anymore .
i' ve no shame left
i wish you' d consider me as important as your music .
rather ... if you hadn' t met me ...
what ?
if i hadn' t met you ?
how could you say that ?
you' re a burden on me , so you' d rather be alone to suffer ?
is that it ?
heesoo , it' s not ...
whenever i talk about us , you end up talking about music .
it may be different from your worries but it hurts me too .
breathing together , worrying together , making compromises , comforting each other .
i want that life now .
heesoo
don' t second guess me or i end up second guessing you
dongsuk
hello
where did you drink so much ?
i drank a little , a little .
is something wrong ?
no it' s nothing
it' s just that ...
oh , because of me ...
no i was just about to close up
wait a minute
here
thank you
if you ... really want something , they say it' il happen , right ?
then if something doesn' t happen , it' s because you didn' t want it enough .
if what you wish for doesn' t happen , there' s something wrong with you .
i thought i knew about these things
i desperately wanted it
there' s something wrong with me i know all this ...
i ... fell asleep here ?
i couldn' t wake you
did i do anything wrong ?
no have some hot tea
dongsuk
i have something to say to you .
yes ?
i
i like you , dongsuk
aeryun ...
it was hard for me to express my feelings .
but i have a ...
you have a girlfriend i know
hello ?
it' s aeryun ...
oh , yes aeryun
i haven' t seen you at the store ...
i' ve been a little busy with my work
i' m not sure if i' m bothering you
no
don' t work too hard
come by the store if you get a chance .
then i' il see you later
sure
hello , thank you , this is sad movie
the prince of egypt ?
one second
ryu dongsuk
sure i' il bring it right over
who is it ?
have you been well ?
yes , but ...
if you finished the prince of egypt , i' il take it .
oh , yes who is it ?
i told you before the video store owner
oh , i see
hello hello
wait one moment
aeryun , right ?
huh ?
dongsuk told me a lot about you
i see
let' s have dinner sometime i hear you helped a lot
yes ...
you' re not driving me home ?
oh
that girl ... she' s prettier than i thought .
uh huh ...
i' il wait for you
you' il find someone special , too .
i really like you , dongsuk .
aeryun ...
i like you , too .
but not in that way
i love you just how you are
i' il wait
you know i already have someone i love
loving someone just because you met her first is stubbornness .
you' re the stubborn one , aeryun .
who is it ?
it' s a rare music video i had a hard time getting it
i thought it might help you work
if i need anything , i' il stop by .
then will you invite me in for tea ?
i' ve something to tell you
i have nothing to say to you
it' il just take a minute
how can you just barge in ?
what kind of person are you ?
you' re making me into a strange person
i just want to say something
i have nothing else to say to you
i don' t need to hear anymore he' s already been here
what ?
seemed to be in his own world i remember ...
too weak
things must be hard for him to get a manager ...
ryu dongsuk
who is it ?
a customer from here ?
no
oh , her .
the one you came with .
she was here a few days ago , alone .
what ?
by the way , she looked familiar .
i think i' ve seen her around
how' d you know her ?
the video shop across the road
we just became friends
she misunderstood
she even knows about heesoo
then tell her you don' t like her
how can i say that to her face ?
with women , you gotta be clear to save confusion .
this is the place
when you come here alone , use my name .
this looks good
why are you doing this ?
if you think about it a little , your heart ...
there was nothing between us there' il be nothing in the future
if you call or come one more time ,
i won' t stand for it .
dongsuk , one second don' t hang up , dongsuk
always , before i can finish , you close the door , hang up , or turn away to leave .
if you heard me out once , you wouldn' t look at me that way .
dongsuk i know work is stressful
someday you' il meet someone who understands your music .
you need to be strong
this is min jihae , the manager at loudness .
i saw you sing at a taehakno cafe .
i' d like to meet you
please call 539 6778 when you get this message
you should watch good movies
films are like food
junk food' s tasty but it will give you a stomachache .

yes that' s me
happy birthday will you sign here , please ?

i' il wait at the place we met for my birthday at 8 : 00
i ... wanted to do the same for you
you were there for me on my birthday
what the hell have i done wrong ?
you don' t seem to be hearing me
i' il be honest
i never once thought of you as a woman
you got it ?
if i' ve done anything wrong , it was getting to know you .
and my only fault was loving you
we' ve been looking for this kind of music .
i' m so lucky
i don' t know if i' m lucky or if you' re the lucky one but please do your best .
i will thank you

dongsuk , the emotion' s missing .
try again
are you the new owner ?
you and i seem to have a lot in common
lemon peel angel ,
kurt cobain , too ...
they say if you really want something , it will happen .
so if something doesn' t happen , it' s because you didn' t want it enough .
if what you wish for doesn' t happen ,
there' s something wrong with you .
take your time there' s no rush
oh , you' re a playboy .
what ?
if you drink that way , they say you' re a playboy .
right i' ve heard that a lot
a friend of mine told me
a friend ?
is she by any chance ...
you wouldn' t know her
you said you saw me sing where was that ?
where ?
actually , when aeryun brought me the tape ,
i didn' t expect much
i promised to keep it a secret
what the hell did you do ?
what are you talking about ?
do i look so pathetic ?
you wanted me to know , huh ?
if i make an album due to you , did you think i' d come crawling to you ?
that was just a coincidence
what gives you the right to do this ?
i just wanted to be a help to you
why do i need your help ?
the thought makes me gag !
you ... were happy when you got the deal
you' re sick in the head
you' re completely insane
yeah , you' re right .
i' m insane .
but you know what ?
people who fall in love , they all go crazy .
go
was it you ?
why give love ... to someone who won' t return it ?
go you shouldn' t be here
dongsuk ?
who ...
who ... ?
why won' t dongsuk come to me ?
if it weren' t for you ...
we truly ... could have been happy
i beg you please leave
i can' t leave dongsuk
please ...
let' s talk later
this pain , it' s not even pain
do you know of my love ?
for dongsuk ...
i can endure any pain
please ...
please stop
you' il be fine , even without dongsuk
without dongsuk , i ...
without dongsuk ...
i' m tired
i also ... want to end it now
but ...
i can' t help myself
i thought i knew what love was
but i' m not sure anymore
that a person could be so devoted to another ...
i' d like us to ... take a break for a while .
would that be a good idea ?
can we be ...
like the way we were ?
heesoo said she wants to break up
i said okay
you' re one hell of a woman
you say you love me ?
then leave me
i' m begging you
was having to leave , was it all a coincidence ?
looking at the rainy road , you' re leaving me again .
still together , all those moments ...
my name is aeryun jung aeryun
ryu dongsuk that' s you ?
i can find a copy for you
hello you must work in this area
i like you , dongsuk

do you know where she went ?
what do you want to know for ?
as long as she' s gone , what do you care ?
