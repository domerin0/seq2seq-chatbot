our cavalry will ride them down like grass .
send the horse .
full attack .
steady !
hold !
hold !
hold !
hold !
now !
send the infantry .
you lead them !
retreat !
bastard !
all right .
wallace !
wallace !
i knight thee sir william wallace .
sir william , in the name of god , we declare and appoint thee guardian and high protector of scotland and thy captains as aides de camp .
stand and be recognized .
does anyone know his politics ?
no , but his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything .
the balliols will kiss his ass , and so we must .
sir william .
sir william ... in as much as you and your captains hail from a region
long known to support the balliol clan , may we invite you to continue your support and uphold our rightful claim .
damn the balliol clan !
they' re all longshanks ' men !
gentlemen .
gentlemen .
now is the time to declare a king .
you' re prepared to recognize our legitimate succession ?
you' re the ones who won' t support the rightful
those were lies
oh , no .
that' s the truth .
i demand recognition of these documents !
these documents were lies when you wrote them !
gentlemen , please !
gentlemen !
please , gentlemen !
wait sir william , where are you going ?
we have beaten the english , but they' il come back because you won' t stand together .
what will you do ?
i will invade england and defeat the english on their own ground .
ha ha ha invade ?
that' s impossible .
why ?
why is that impossible ?
you' re so concerned with squabbling for the scraps from longshanks ' table that you' ve missed your god given right to something better .
there' s a difference between us .
you think the people of this country exist to provide you with position .
i think your position exists to provide those people with freedom , and i go to make sure that they have it .
wait
i respect what you said , but remember that these men have lands and castles .
it' s much to risk .
the common man that bleeds on the battlefield does he risk less ?
no ... but from top to bottom , this country has got no sense of itself .
its nobles share allegiance with england .
its clans war with each other .
aye . if you make enemies on both sides of the border , you' il end up dead .
we all end up dead .
it' s just a question of how and why .
i want what you want , but we need the nobles .
we need them ?
aye .
nobles .
tell me , what does that mean to be noble ?
your title gives you claim to the throne of our country , but men don' t follow titles , they follow courage .
now , our people know you .
noble and common they respect you , and if you would just lead them to freedom ... they' d follow you .
and so would i.
damn it !
my sodomite cousin the prince tells me he has no troops to lend , and every town in northern england is begging for help .
he advances !
to which town ?
to here , my lord .
bring the provisions inside !
double the wall guards !
seal the gate !
now !
hyah !
bring in the provisions !
sir , we can get you out if you leave now .
i' m not about to tell my uncle
i' ve lost him the greatest city in northern england .
come on !
make way for the king !
it' s not your fault .
stand up to him !
i will stand up to him and more .
what news of the north ?
nothing new , your majesty .
we' ve sent riders to speed any word .
i heard the word in france , where i was fighting to expand your future kingdom .
the word , my son , is that our entire northern army is annihilated ... and you have done nothing .
i i have ordered conscriptions .
they' re assembled and ready to depart .
excuse me , sire , but there' s a very urgent message from york .
come .
leave us .
thank you , sire .
uh , w wallace has sacked york .
what ?
wallace has sacked york .
sire ... thy own nephew .
what beast could do such a thing ?
if he can sack york ... he can invade lower england .
we would stop him !
who is this person who speaks to me as though i needed his advice ?
i have declared phillip my high counselor .
is he qualified ?
i am skilled in the arts of war and military tactics , sire .
are you ?
then tell me ... what advice would you offer on the , uh , present , uh , situation ?
i shall offer a truce ... and buy him off .
but who will go to him ?
not i.
if i fell under the sword of that murderer , it might be my head in a basket .
and not my gentle son .
the mere sight of him would only encourage an enemy to take over the whole country .
so whom do i send ?
whom do i send ?
i' m dreaming .
yes , you are .
and you must wake .
uh ...
i don' t want to wake .
i want to stay here with you .
and i with you ... but you must wake now .
wake up , william .
wake up .
william , wake up , wake up .
william
a royal entourage comes !
flying banners of truce !
and the standards of longshanks himself !
i am the princess of wales .
i come as the king' s servant and with his authority .
to do what ?
to discuss the king' s proposals .
will you speak with a woman ?
i understand you have recently been given the rank of knight .
i have been given nothing .
god makes men what they are .
did god make you the sacker of peaceful cities ?
the executioner of the king' s nephew , my husband' s own cousin ?
york was the staging point for every invasion of my country , and that royal cousin hanged innocent scots , even women and children from the city walls .
well , longshanks did far worse the last time he took a scottish city .
you ask your king to his face .
ask him .
you see if his eyes can convince you of the truth .
hamilton , leave us .
milady
leave us .
now .
let us talk plainly .
you invade england , but you cannot complete the conquest so far from your shelter and supply .
the king desires peace .
longshanks desires peace ?
he declares it to me .
i swear it .
he proposes that you withdraw your attack .
in return , he grants you title , estates , and this chest of gold , which i am to pay to you personally .
a lordship and titles ... gold ... that i should become judas ?
peace is made in such ways .
slaves are made in such ways !
the last time longshanks spoke of peace ,
i was a boy , and many scottish nobles , who would not be slaves , were lured by him , under a flag of truce , to a barn ... where he had them hanged .
i was very young , but i remember longshanks ' notion of peace .
i understand you have suffered .
i know ... about your woman .
she was my wife .
we married in secret because i would not share her with an english lord .
they killed her ... to get to me .
i have never spoken of it .
i don' t know why i tell you now , except ...
i see her strength in you .
one day , you' il be a queen ... and you must open your eyes .
you tell your king that william wallace will not be ruled ... and nor will any scot while i live .
ah , my son' s loyal wife returns unkilled by the heathen .
so he accepted our bribe ?
no , he did not .
then why does he stay ?
my scouts tell me that he has not advanced .
he waits for you at york .
he says he will attack no more towns or cities if you are man enough to come and face him .
did he ?
the welsh bowmen will not be detected arriving so far around his flank .
the main force of our armies from france will land here to the north of edinburgh .
conscripts from ireland will approach from the southwest ... to here .
welsh bowmen ?
troops from france ?
irish conscripts ?
even if you dispatch them today , they' d take weeks to assemble .
i dispatched them before i sent your wife .
so our little ruse succeeded .
thank you .
and while this upstart awaits my arrival in york , my forces will have arrived in edinburgh behind him .
you spoke with this , uh , wallace in private .
tell me ... what kind of man is he ?
a mindless barbarian .
not a king like you , my lord .
you may return to your embroidery .
humbly , my lord .
you brought back the money , of course .
no .
i gave it to ease the suffering of the children of this war .
that' s what happens when you send a woman .
forgive me , sire .
i thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule .
ahem .
my greatness will be better demonstrated when wallace returns to scotland and finds his country in ashes .
william !
there' s riders approaching
personal escort of the princess .
aye .
must have made an impression .
aye .
i didn' t think you were in the tent that long .
mademoiselle .
un message de ma maitresse .
merci .
it' s true !
english ships are moving up from the south !
i don' t know about the welsh yet , but the irish have landed !
i had to see it before i could believe it .
why are the irish fighting with the english ?
i wouldn' t worry about them .
didn' t i tell you before ?
it' s my island .
hamish , ride ahead to edinburgh and assemble the council .
order it .
aye .
hup !
hyah !
your island ?
my island !
yup !
you want to negotiate ?
no , please , gentlemen !
lords , craig is right !
this time our only option is to negotiate .
unless you want to see edinburgh razed to the ground
my army has marched for more days than i can remember , and we still have preparations to make , so i' il make this plain .
we require every soldier you can summon your personal escorts , even yourselves and we need them now .
with such a force arrayed against us , it' s time to discuss other options .
other options ?
don' t you wish at least to lead your men onto the field and barter a better deal with longshanks before you tuck tail and run ?
sir william
we can' t defeat this army !
we can !
and we will !
we won at stirling ... and still you quibble !
we won at york , and you would not support us . if you' il not stand up with us now , then i say you' re cowards .
and if you' re scotsmen ,
i' m ashamed to call myself one .
please , sir william , speak with me alone .
i beg you .
now , you' ve achieved more than anyone ever dreamed , but fighting these odds , it looks like rage , not courage .
it' s well beyond rage .
help me .
in the name of christ , help yourselves !
now is our chance .
now .
if we join , we can win .
if we win , we' il have what none of us ever had before a country of our own .
you' re the rightful leader .
and there is strength in you , i see it .
unite us .
unite us !
unite the clans .
all right .
right .
this cannot be the way .
you said yourself  the nobles will not support wallace .
so how did it help us to join the side that is slaughtered ?
i gave him my word .
i know it is hard .
being a leader is .
but , son ... son ...
look at me .
i cannot be king .
you and you alone can rule scotland .
what i tell you , you must do .
not for me , not for yourself , for your country .
eh , lads , make way .
coming through here .
make way , lads .
make
the bruce is not coming , william .
he' il come .
mornay and lochlan have come .
so will the bruce .
quite the lovely ... gathering .
wouldn' t you agree ?
the archers are ready , sire .
not the archers .
my scouts tell me their archers are miles away and no threat to us .
arrows cost money .
use up the irish .
the dead cost nothing .
and send in the infantry and cavalry .
infantry !
infantry !
cavalry !
cavalry !
cavalry !
cavalry !
advance !
advance !
ah , good to see you this morning .
irish .
glad to have you with us .
watch this .
mornay ?
lochlan ?
i gave mornay double his lands in scotland and matching estates in england .
lochlan turned for much less .
archers .
i beg pardon , sire .
won' t we hit our own troops ?
yes ... but we' il hit theirs as well .
we have reserves .
attack .
archers !
archers ... attack !
loose !
loose !
send in our reinforcements .
send in the rest
bring me wallace .
alive , if possible .
dead ... just as good .
send us news of our victory .
shall we retire ?
protect the king .
get up !
get up !
up !
get up !
get him out of here !
go !
i' m dying .
let me be .
no .
you' re going to live .
i' ve lived long enough to live free .
proud to see you become the man you are .
i' m a happy man .
i' m the one who' s rotting , but i think your face looks graver than mine .
son ...
we must have alliance with england to prevail here .
you achieved that .
you saved your family , increased your land .
in time , you will have all the power in scotland .
lands , titles , men , power nothing .
nothing ?
i have nothing .
men fight for me ... because if they do not , i throw them off my land and i starve their wives and their children .
those men who bled the ground red at falkirk ... they fought for william wallace , and he fights for something that i' ve never had .
and i took it from him when i betrayed him , and i saw it in his face on the battlefield , and it' s tearing me apart !
well , all men betray , all lose heart .
i don' t want to lose heart !
i want to believe ... as he does .
i will never be on the wrong side again .
no !
there he is !
after him !
lord craig , is it true about mornay ?
aye .
wallace rode into his bed chamber and killed him .
more a liability now than ever he was .
and there' s no telling who' il be next .
maybe you .
maybe me .
it doesn' t matter .
i' m serious , robert .
so am i !
christ shit !
search the place !
lochlan .
william wallace killed 50 men .
50 if it was one .
1 00 men ... with his own sword .
cut through them like ...
moses through the red sea .
his legend grows .
it will be worse than before .
he rallies new volunteers in every scottish town , and when he replenishes his numbers
they' re sheep !
mere sheep !
easily dispersed if we strike the shepherd .
very well .
pick a flock of your finest assassins and set a meeting .
my lord , wallace is renowned for his ability to smell an ambush .
if what lord hamilton tells me is correct , he warmed to our future queen .
he would trust her .
so we' il dispatch her with the notion that she comes in peace .
my lord , the princess might be taken hostage or her life be put in jeopardy .
oh , my son would be most distressed by that .
uh , but in truth , if she were to be killed , we would soon find the king of france a useful ally against the scots .
you see , as king , you must find the good in any situation .
it' s william wallace , sure .
he' s giving up his sword .
be ready .
milady ...
i received your message .
oh .
this is ... the second time you' ve warned me of danger .
why ?
there will be a new shipment of supplies coming north next month foods and weapons .
no , stop .
why do you help me ?
why do you help me ?
because of the way you are looking at me now .
just when we thought all hope was lost , our noble saviors have arrived .
off with their ... hoods .
sir william , we' ve come to seek a meeting .
well , what' s the point ?
you' ve all sworn loyalty to longshanks .
an oath to a liar is no oath at all .
every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you .
so let the council swear publicly .
we cannot .
some scarcely believe you' re alive .
others think you' il pay them mornay' s wages .
so we bid you to edinburgh .
meet us two days from now .
pledge us your pardon , and we' il unite behind you .
scotland will be one .
one ?
you mean us and you .
no .
i mean this .
it' s the pledge of robert the bruce .
you do know it' s a trap .
tell him .
if the bruce wanted to kill you , he' d have done it at falkirk .
aye .
i know .
i saw .
leave him aside .
what about the others ?
nest of scheming bastards !
they couldn' t agree on the color of shite !
it' s a trap .
are you blind ?
look at us .
we' ve got to try .
we can' t do this alone .
joining the nobles is the only hope for our people .
you know what happens if we don' t take that chance ?
what ?
nothing .
i don' t want to be a martyr .
nor i. i want to live .
i want a home and children and peace .
do you ?
aye , i do .
i' ve asked god for those things .
it' s all for nothing if you don' t have freedom .
that' s just a dream , william .
a dream ?
just a ...
well , then what have we been doing all this time ?
we' ve lived that dream .
your dream isn' t about freedom .
it' s about murron .
your dream is to be a hero ' cause you think she sees you .
i don' t think she sees me .
i know she does .
and your father sees you , too .
ohh !
ah .
jesus .
get up .
give us your hand .
shall i come with you ?
no .
i' il go alone .
i' il see you after .
right .
sooner rather than later , i hope .
he won' t come .
he will .
i know he will .
my lord , he approaches !
no !
stay out of it , robert !
aah !
you lied !
you lied !
bruce is not to be hurt !
that' s the arrangement !
father !
you rotting bastard
why ?
why ?
longshanks acquired wallace .
so did our nobles .
that was the price of your crown .
die !
i want you to die !
soon enough i' il be dead , and you' il be king .
i don' t want anything from you .
you' re not a man !
you' re not my father .
you' re my son , and you' ve always known my mind .
you deceived me .
you let yourself be deceived .
in your heart , you always knew what had to happen here .
thus , you know what it means to hate .
now you' re ready to be a king .
my hate will die ... with you .
william wallace , you stand in taint of high treason .
against whom ?
against your king .
have you anything to say ?
never in my whole life ... did i swear allegiance to him .
it matters not .
he is your king .
confess , and you may receive a quick death .
deny , and you must be purified by pain .
do you confess ?
do you confess ?
then on the morrow , you shall receive your purification .
your highness .
i will see the prisoner .
we' ve got orders from the king
the king will be dead in a month .
his son is a weakling .
who do you think will rule this kingdom ?
now open this door .
majesty .
come on , filth .
up on your feet .
stop it !
leave me .
i said , leave me !
milady .
sir , i come to beg you ... to confess all and swear allegiance to the king that he might show you mercy .
will he show mercy to my country ?
mercy is to die quickly , perhaps even live in a tower .
in time , who knows what can happen ... if you can only live ?
if i swear to him , then all that i am is dead already .
you will die .
it will be awful .
every man dies .
not every man really lives .
drink this .
it will dull your pain .
no .
it will numb my wits .
i must have them all .
for if i' m senseless , or if i wail , then longshanks will have broken me .
i can' t bear the thought of your torture .
take it .
all right .
i have come to beg for the life of william wallace .
you' re quite taken with him , aren' t you ?
i respect him .
at worst , he was a worthy enemy .
show mercy , o thou great king , and win the respect of your own people .
even now ... you are incapable of mercy .
and you ...
to you , that word is as unfamiliar as love .
before he lost his powers of speech , he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know wallace was dead .
you see ... death comes to us all .
but before it comes to you , know this
your blood dies with you .
a child who is not of your line grows in my belly .
your son will not sit long on the throne , i swear it .
i' m so afraid .
give me the strength ... to die well .
here he comes
now behold the awful price of treason
you will fall to your knees now .
declare yourself the king' s loyal subject and beg his mercy .
and you shall have it .
rope !
stretch him
that' s it stretch him
shame shame
pleasant ... yes ?
rise to your knees , kiss the royal emblem on my cloak , and you will feel no more .
rack him
enough ?
ohh .
it can all end right now .
peace .
just say it .
cry out mercy .
mercy
mercy mercy
cry out .
mercy mercy
just say it mercy .
mercy mercy
mercy , william .
mercy .
jesus , now say it .
the prisoner wishes to say a word .
mercy mercy
mercy
freeeedoooom
after the beheading ,
william wallace' s body was torn to pieces .
his head was set on london bridge , his arms and legs sent to the four corners of britain as a warning .
it did not have the effect that longshanks planned .
andl  robert the bruce rode out to pay homage to the armies of the english king and accept his end or segment of my crown .
i hope you' ve washed your ass this morning .
it' s about to be kissed by a king .
come .
let' s get it over with .
stop !
you have bled with wallace !
now bleed with me .
oh ...
wallace !
wallace !
wallace !
wallace !
wallace !
wallace !
in the year of our lord , 1314 , patriots of scotland , starving and out numbered , charged the fields of bannockburn .
they fought like warrior poets , they fought like scots men ... and won their freedom .
