what do you mean , " everybody' s dead " ?
a guy come running into the bar and says ... ... his mother and father are shot .
i' ve been to a lot of crime scenes , never seen one like this .
six members of the family were found last night ... ... in bed , shot ... ... and killed .
killed were car dealer ronald defeo , his wife and four of their children .
the sole survivor of the family ... ... 23 year old ronald " butch " defeo jr ... ... is said to have discovered the bodies .
the police state that for his own safety ... ... they' re holding him in protective custody .
five of the victims were found shot facedown on their beds .
the sixth was found in a closet .
no one seemed to stir in their sleep .
it' s strange .
suffolk county police have charged 23 year old ronald defeo jr .
the accused told police he heard voices ... ... coming from within the house , telling him to murder his family .
oh , god !

it' s gotta be a misprint .
i' m a contractor ... ... and i know what a place like this should cost .
and , you know , if this is
well , if this is true , then this is a the deal of a lifetime .
and what is wrong with that ?
come on .
i love it .
there' s a vibrant history here .
vibrant history , george .
ln fact , the house was built in 1 692 , at least the basement .
the rest of the house was added from that foundation .
it' s one of the oldest dutch colonials in long lsland .
wow , that' s impressive .
this room would be perfect for children , if you have any .
and the view' s well , have a look for yourselves .
there' s a boathouse .
oh , all you need now is a boat , right ?
actually , george has a speedboat .
this place sounds like it' s made for you .
and this is your basement .
as you can see , it' s very spacious .
it can be a game room , a playroom .
well , let' s let' s have a look .
i' il just wait up here .
yep , looks like a basement .
so , what do you guys think ?
i think you look foxy in that skirt .
will you stop it ?
come on .
yes , yes , okay ?
it' s a value .
it' s a value for people with money .

we deserve this , george .
you deserve this .
how many times you tell me how hard you work for so little .
kathy  maybe today is the day it all pays off .
we' il make sacrifices .
huge sacrifices .

there' s always a catch .
there was a tragedy , a crime ...

i' m sorry , what ?
ln the house ?
several people , a family .
but , you know , we' ve moved on , the whole town .
it is a distant memory now .
and the house is fine .
really .
doesn' t it seem kind of strange to buy this house , honey ?
well , houses don' t kill people .
people kill people .
just excuse us .
do you think we can make it work ?
you know what ?
you want it , then we' re gonna make it work .
really ?
i' il work out of the basement ... ... and you can , well ...

billy , look at me .
i need you to give george a chance , okay ?

you are way too young to hear this .
so cover your ears .
and don' t listen .

i read about how he slit his throat ... ... so that his presence would live forever .
do you believe this could be true ?
ronnie defeo came to me weeks before the murders ... ... and he spoke about hearing voices and seeing things in the house .
