my life is meaningless as long as you' re still alive .
what am i while you exist ?
a shadow ?
an echo ?
if your issues are with me , then deal with me .
this has nothing to do with my ship ... nothing to do with the federation .
oh , but it does .
we will no longer bow before anyone as slaves not the romulans and not your mighty federation .
we are a race bred for war and conquest .
are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons ?
it amazes me how little you know yourself .
i' m incapable of such an act !
you are me .
the same noble picard blood runs through our veins .
had you lived my life , you' d be doing exactly as i am .
so look in the mirror .
see yourself .
consider that , captain .
i can think of no greater torment for you .
shinzon .
i' m a mirror for you as well .
not for long , captain .
i' m afraid you won' t survive to witness the victory of the echo over the voice .
his cloak is perfect .
no tachyon emissions , no residual antiprotons .
keep at it , geordi .
find a way in .
praetor shinzon needs the prisoner .
about time , mr. data .
my mission was a success , sir .
i have located the source of the radiation .
this entire ship is essentially a thalaron generator .
its power relays lead to an activation matrix on the bridge .
it' s a weapon .
it would appear so .
what about the download ?
shinzon believes he has our communication protocols but they will give him inaccurate locations for all starfleet vessels .
good work .
sir .
geordi supplied me with a prototype of the emergency transport unit .
i recommend you use this , sir , to return to the enterprise .
it will only work for one of us .
yes , sir .
we' il find a way off together .
it is time for the procedure .
move , puny human animal .
a bit less florid , data .
kill him .
this way , sir .
there is a shuttlebay 94 meters from our current position .
there it is , sir .
go !
data !
it appears to have an encrypted security system .
alacrity will be appreciated , commander !
reman is a most complex language , with pictographs representing certain verb roots ...
while i find that fascinating ,
data , we really need that door open !
according to the ship' s manifest they are scorpion class attack flyers .
data , what do you imagine this is ?
port thruster , sir .
would you like me to drive , sir ?
data , can you open the shuttlebay doors ?
negative , sir .
they have erected a force field around the external portals .
well , then , only one way to go .
do you think this is a wise course of action , sir ?
we' re about to find out , data .
power up the disruptors .
ready , captain .
fire .
tractor beam , now !
worf , lock on transporters .
i have them , sir .
this has gone far enough .
i thought we discussed patience , commander .
mine is wearing thin .
we supported you because you promised action , and yet , you delay .
the enterprise is immaterial .
it won' t even make it out of the neutral zone .
and in two days , the federation will be crippled beyond repair .
does that satisfy you ?
for the moment .
and when i return , you and i shall have a little talk about showing proper respect .
what' s happening to his face ?
commander , a moment .
are you truly prepared to have your hands drenched in blood ?
he' s not planning to defeat earth .
he' s planning its annihilation .
and his sins will mark us and our children for generations .
the more i studied his dna , the more confusing it got .
finally , i could come to only one conclusion .
shinzon was created with temporal rna sequencing .
he was designed so that , at a certain point , his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly .
he was engineered to skip 30 years of his life .
but when the temporal sequencing wasn' t activated , his cellular structure started breaking down .
he' s dying .
dying ?
can anything be done for him ?
nothing except a complete transfusion from the only donor with compatible dna ... you .
how long does he have ?
i can' t say for sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating .
then he' il come for me .
brother , i ... cannot move .
no .
i have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines .
why ?
because you are dangerous .
why ?
you have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship .
i ... do not understand .
i know .
do you know anything about shinzon' s plans against the federation ?
no .
do you have any knowledge of the tactical abilities of his ship ?
no .
can i move now ?
no .
what are you doing ?
i must deactivate you .
for how long ?
indefinitely .
how long is tha ... ?
a long time , brother .
it' s called a cascading biogenic pulse .
the unique properties of thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limit .
depending on its radiant intensity , it could encompass a ship ... or a planet .
he would only have built a weapon of such scope for one reason .
he' s going after earth .
how can you be certain ?
i know how he thinks .
destroy humanity , you cripple the federation .
the romulans invade .
no way of penetrating his cloak ?
no .
so he could pass within ten meters of every ship in starfleet and they' d never know .
we do have one advantage , though .
he needs your blood to live .
he might come after you first .
i' m counting on it .
we' ve been ordered to sector 1045 .
our fleet has been diverted to meet us there .
strength in numbers .
yes .
at least , that' s what we hope .
he must not be allowed to use that weapon .
all other concerns are secondary .
you understand me ?
yes , sir .
all hands ... battle stations .
initiate the force field .
captain' s personal log , supplemental .
we' re heading toward federation space at maximum warp .
the crew has responded with the dedication
i' ve come to expect of them .
and like a thousand other commanders on a thousand other battlefields ,
i wait for the dawn .
how long ?
a matter of hours .
we must begin the procedure now .
how long until we reach the rift ?
seven minutes .
data , what' s our current position ?
how soon until we reach the fleet ?
at our current velocity , we will arrive at sector 1045 in approximately 40 minutes , sir .
for now we see but through a glass darkly .
sir ?
he said he is a mirror .
of you , sir ?
yes .
i do not agree .
although you share the same genetic structure , the events of your life have created a unique individual .
if i had lived his life , is it possible that i would' ve rejected my humanity ?
the b 4 is physically identical to me , although his neural pathways are not as advanced .
but even if they were , he would not be me .
how can you be sure ?
i aspire , sir , to be better than i am .
b 4 does not ... nor does shinzon .
we are passing through the bassen rift , sir .
the projection will return when we have cleared it .
it' s interfering with our uplink from starfleet cartography ?
the rift affects all long range communica ...
commander riker , evasive maneuvers .
target weapon systems and shields .
i don' t want the enterprise destroyed .
can you learn to see in the dark , captain ?
report .
he' s firing through the cloak .
we can' t get a lock .
he disabled our warp drive with his first shot .
we only have impulse , captain .
mr. worf , prepare a full phaser spread .
zero elevation .
all banks on my mark .
scan for shield impact .
stand by , photon torpedoes .
aye , sir .
fire .
you' re too slow , old man .
attack pattern shinzon theta .
we are losing dorsal shields !
full axis rotation to port .
fire all ventral phasers .
minimal damage to the scimitar .
defensive pattern kirk epsilon .
get the shields on line , geordi .
i' m already on it .
counselor troi , report to the bridge .
captain ... we are being hailed .
on screen .
captain picard ... will you join me in your ready room ?
you can' t trace my holographic emitters , captain , so don' t bother .
and you can' t contact starfleet .
it' s just the two of us now , jean luc .
as it should be .
why are you here ?
to accept your surrender .
i can clearly destroy you at any time .
lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship .
and the enterprise ?
i have little interest in your quaint vessel , captain .
look at me , shinzon .
your heart , your hands ... your eyes are the same as mine .
the blood pumping within you ... the raw material is the same .
we have the same potential .
that' s the past , captain .
it can be the future .
buried deep within you , beneath all the years of pain and anger , there is something that has never been nurtured .
the potential to make yourself a better man .
and that is what it is to be human .
to make yourself more than you are .
oh , yes .
i know you .
there was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be .
childish dreams , captain ,
iost in the dilithium mines of remus .
i am what you see now .
i see more than that .
i see what you could be .
the man who is shinzon of remus and jean luc picard could never exterminate the population of an entire planet .
he' s better than that .
he is what his life has made him .
then , what will you do with that life ?
waste it in a blaze of hatred ?
there is a better way .
it' s too late .
never , never .
you still have a choice .
make the right one now .
i can' t fight what i am .
yes , you can .
i' il show you my true nature .
our nature .
and as earth dies , remember , i will always forever be shinzon of remus .
and my voice shall echo through time
long after yours has faded to a dim memory .
two ships de cloaking , sir .
romulan .
captain .
just when i thought this couldn' t get any worse .
we are being hailed .
on screen .
captain picard , commander donatra of the warbird valdore .
might we be of assistance ?
assistance ?
the empire considers this a matter of internal security .
we regret you' ve become involved .
commander , when this is over , i owe you a drink .
romulan ale , captain .
let' s get to work .
you heard the lady .
let' s go to work .
mr. worf , coordinate our attack with the valdore tactical officer .
triangulate all fire on any shield impact .
aye , sir .
aft shields down to 40 percent .
keep our bow on the scimitar .
auxiliary power to forward shields .
aye , sir .
target the flanking warbird .
all forward disruptor banks on my mark .
forward shields down to 10 percent .
bring us about .
drop cloak on the aft port quadrant .
prepare for full emergency stop .
what ?
you heard me .
he' s losing his cloak .
stand by all forward disruptor banks .
she' s almost on us .
not yet .
praetor !
full stop !
fire !
restore the aft cloak and bring us about .
i' m afraid that drink will have to wait , captain .
do you have life support ?
for the moment .
but we' re dead in the water .
understood .
we are losing structural integrity on decks 12 through 17 , sections four through ten .
emergency force fields are holding .
evacuate those decks and reroute field power to forward shields .
captain ...
i think i may have a way to find them .
prepare for a lateral run .
all starboard disruptors .
what is it ?
what is it ?
she' s here .
he' s resisting me .
no !
remember me .
now !
fire at will .
prepare a boarding party .
bring me picard .
you .
get the cloak back !
target all shield coordinates , beta three .
all disruptors , fire .
captain , we' ve lost central shielding on deck 29 .
divert all power and compensate .
intruder alert .
number one .
let' s go .
security detail to deck 29 .
the romulans fought with honor .
yes , they did , mr. worf .
worf , cover me .
medical team to the bridge .
... functioning on reserve power only .
did you check the system status ?
report .
we have exhausted our complement of photon torpedoes .
phaser banks are down to four percent , sir .
what if we targeted all our phasers in a concentrated pattern ?
the scimitar' s shields are still at 70 percent .
it would make no difference , captain .
we have damage on all decks .
what' s he doing ?
he wants to look me in the eye .
we' ve got him .
he thinks he knows exactly what i am going to do .
geordi , divert all power to the engines .
take it from life support , if you have to .
give me everything you' ve got .
ready , captain .
we are being hailed , sir .
deanna , stand by .
open a channel .
i hope you' re still alive , jean luc .
oh , yes , i am .
don' t you think it' s time to surrender ?
why should the rest of your crew have to die ?
shinzon , i don' t think i ever told you ... about my first academy evaluation .
in particular , i was thought to be extremely ... ... overconfident .
captain , as much as i enjoy listening to you talk ,
i really think ...
on my mark , deanna .
all hands , brace for impact .
engage .
hard to port !
divert all power to the engines .
full reverse .
no !
reconfiguring now .
computer , stand by auto destruct sequence omega .
recognize voice pattern jean luc picard .
alpha alpha 3 0 5 .
auto destruct is off line .
disruptors are not functional , sir .
deploy the weapon .
kill everything on that ship .
then set a course for earth .
we must complete our mission .
matrix initiated .
sequencing procedure for thalaron radiation transfer ... activated .
some ideals are worth dying for , aren' t they , jean luc ?
thalaron intermix procedure initiated .
deployment of targeting arms commencing .
how long until he can fire ?
the targeting sequence should take about seven minutes , captain .
when the targeting arms are fully deployed , the matrix on the bridge will relay the thalaron radiation to the firing points at their tips .
no one on the enterprise will survive .
how can he ?
he' il kill you .
it' s not about me anymore .
prepare for a site to site transport .
captain , i don' t think that the transpor ...
that' s an order , commander .
sir , allow me to go .
data , this is something i have to do .
sir ...
data .
you have the bridge , commander .
try and put some distance between you and the scimitar .
now , mr. la forge .
aye , sir .
that' s it .
transporters are down .
the system is fused .
counselor troi , please assume command .
geordi , come with me .
thalaron intermix level ... 30 percent .
four minutes to firing sequence .
thalaron intermix level , 50 percent .
three minutes to firing sequence .
thalaron intermix level , 60 percent .
two minutes to firing sequence .
thalaron intermix level , 80 percent .
i' m glad we' re together now .
our destiny' s complete .
one minute to firing sequence .
thalaron intermix level completed .
30 seconds to firing sequence .
good bye .
ten , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three ...
data ?
captain ...
it' s data .
captain , we' re being hailed .
on screen .
open a channel .
this is commander donatra of the valdore .
we' re dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies .
thank you , commander .
you' ve earned a friend in the romulan empire today , captain .
i hope the first of many .
valdore out .
geordi , prepare the shuttlebay for arrivals .
they , uh , they don' t know our procedures .
just open the doors .
i' il take care of it , captain .
you have the bridge , number one .
thank you .
to absent friends .
to family .
first time i saw data , he was leaning against a tree in the holodeck trying to whistle .
funniest thing i ever saw .
no matter what he did , he couldn' t get the tune right .
what was that song ?
can' t remember the song .
come .
will .
permission to disembark , sir .
granted .
so ... where' s the titan off to ?
the neutral zone .
we' re heading up the new task force .
apparently the romulans are interested in talking .
well , i can' t think of a better man for the job .
if i may , just a word of advice about your first command ?
anything .
when your first officer insists that you can' t go on away missions ...
ignore him .
i intend to .
serving with you has been an honor .
the honor was mine , captain .
i don' t know if all this has made any sense , but i wanted you to know what kind of man he was .
in his quest to be more like us he helped us to see what it means to be human .
my ... my brother was not human ?
no , he wasn' t .
but his wonder , his curiosity about every facet of human nature allowed all of us to see the best parts of ourselves .
he evolved .
he embraced change because he always wanted to be better than he was .
i ...
i do not understand .
well , i hope someday you will .
captain , the warp engines are ready to go on line .
i' m on my way .
please inform commander la forge .
we' il talk later .
never saw the sun
never saw the sun
never saw the sun
shining so bright ...
shining so bright
never saw things ...
going so right .
going so right ...
