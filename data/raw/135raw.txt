my lord , it' s time , you have to leave .
they will have you arrested .
bring me some candles , i' m working late tonight .
but , my lord ..
and a glass of wine , as usual .
the world had no choice but to change ... .. but the revolution has become terror and me myself will be taken with away .
the certainties make people blind and mad .
they can tear their hearts apart and make a beast of themselves .
in the year 1764 ... ... the beast appeared on our grounds and made it his .
one year later it was known far beyond our region ... ... and people began to think nobody could ever defeat it .
by his attacks the gevaudan sunk deeper and deeper into the darkness .
stop ...
who are you ?
what did he do ?
he' s a thief .
and she ?
his daughter .
a witch .
i healed their horses and they refuse to pay .
do not listen .
a word has no meaning here .
are the horses healed ?
yes .
go on .
welcome in the land of the beast .
and watch out for wolf traps .
knight gregoire de fronsac ... ... en the man called mani were hunters nor soldiers .
as taxidermist of the king .. ... the knight in paris the reputation of a free minded and ... intellectual person .
the one who was following him .. ... as his shadow was a stranger nobody knew of .
when evening fell ... ... they offered themselves to the castle of marquis apcher ... ... who gave them shelter as long as their mission in gevaudan would last .
our people are not afraid of an ordinary wolf .
the beast is different .
it flees from men like it knows it has to .. but it spares neither women nor children .
have you seen it ?
no .
how do you know it' s an animal then ?
those who survived gave that description .
it' s much bigger then a wolf and it doesn' t fear bullets .
i understand your scepticism .
i don' t believe in monsters either ... ... but i had a report made for you .. ... of the crimes of the beast .
you can judge yourself .
grandfather said you were fighting the english in canada ...
yes .
i went there to study the animals and nature . ... but i came back hurt and with the grade of captain .
i arranged a hospital for the victims of the beast .
in an old abbey .
a women from lorciere .
she came back from a party ... when the beast attacked her .
help came .
the beast vanished ... ... but it deformed her face ...
tell me , knight , how is mr buffon ?
and how are things in paris ?
and the innocent one ?
read about it already ?
it is kind of late for philosophy .
you' re right .
how about the theatre ?
do you know actresses ?
what are they performing this winter ?
put it right there .
people say she is courteous .
i' m not sure if it' s true , but they offered their charms .
tell me .
with this your curiosity will be satisfied .
mercurius of france .
we only have the post of avignon .
i will show you the sleeping room .
he is sleeping over here .
good .
good night , knight .
it' s not versailles , but the wine is good .
fat as a pig ...
jacques has seen many wolves .
what attacked him , was not a wolf .
the snout was longer and the teeth were like knifes .
if it' s not a wolf , what is it then ?
a devil .
knight .
the beast attacked a women in saint alban .
there .
don' t worry knight , nobody is here .
stop .
what are they doing here ?
son of a whore .
good day , captain .
sir marquis .
i greet you .
but be careful .
there are traps everywhere .
this is gregoire de fronsac , of the garden of the king .
he wants to see the body of this unlucky soul .
with your permission of course .
you treated my men merciless
i did not know they were acting in your command .
they were not .
you did good and i apologize .
my soldiers are made for war , not for hunting .
the intestines were emptied and now there is poison in it .
what kind of gardener are you ?
when the beast is dead , the king wants it examined ... ... and save it in paris .
i have to stuff it after the hunt .
now i try getting familiar with it .
with such jaws the animal should weigh 250 kilos .
this time i will catch it .
before the first snow i will have it .
if everybody helps , it can' t escape .
did you see it already ?
once now .
in 13 months .
i shot it and hit it .
it collapsed but got up instantly again .
we lost it south of the mouchet .
did it look like this ?
it had some sort of black bar ... with stings do you understand ?
friends , let me introduce you the maker of the drawings .
knight gregoire de fronsac ... ... the man comes from paris to .. catch the beast .
his eminence , the bishop of mende .
his eminence , the duke of moncan
his eminence , the count of morangias ... .. and mrs. count and their son jean francois ... ... who has traveled a lot too ...
good , my lord .
thank you , my lord .
my lord laffond , our intendant .. .. and the priest of saint alban , henrie sardis .
tell us , my lord ...
are people talking a lot about the beast in paris ?
people even sang about it .
they should prey .
would captain duhamel need gods help ?
who can without god' s help ?
duhamel disguises his soldiers in women .
to get the beast .
what a strategy .
duhamel does all he can .
i think you' re obliging .
duhamel is incapable .
they destroy a lot .
but the beast is still there .
like taxes are meant to be for paying duhamel ... ... i rather give it to my servants .
what do you think ?
my lord duke likes carp at , but he is a good christian .
when you arrived , they were boring me ... ... with the good god and all that holy talk .
the pope would even have sent a spy ... ... to see if the beast has anything to do with the devil .
excuse me .
marianne de morangias .
difficult , very difficult .
everybody was breaking their minds about it .
who is next ?
maxime des forets .
actor .
that will be easy .
be careful .
he' s a morangias ...
mrs ..
hello , my lord , we were talking ..
are you maxime des forets ?
what a pleasure .
good actors are rare .
the marquis was talking about you .
the marquis ?
he wants to have a chronicle written about his family .
he' s thinking about you .
is he ?
he is in a good mood .
it' s now or never .
but act like you don' t know and let him start talking about it .
mrs. excuse me ....
aren' t you ashamed ?
my god .
no .
so , mr. stuffer ... do you like our region ?
until now i only saw beauties .
or at least one of them .
do people talk about girls this way in the court ?
no ...
something like this you should save for the innocent farmers .
i would go to the court if there were women like you .
food is being served , knight .
let' s eat .
i' il follow you .
we were in saint laurent for 12 days already when we found the most ..
.. bizarre animal in our nets i ever saw
the indians told me about holy fish ... ... but i was convinced it was a legend .
i saw a fish with the looks and size of a trout . ... but it' s body was completely covered with a hairy skin as black as poison .
a hairy trout ?
you' re joking .
no , my lord .
salmo truta dermopilla , from canada .
that is really strange .
as soft as fur .
nature is extraordinary .
the water will be cold ...
it proves the impossible is possible sometimes .
with this discovery you earned a lot of respect .
i doubt he deserves that .
but i admit , knight , you got talent as an actor .
if i would have two hands , i would give an applause .
jean francois .
please excuse him , my lord .
your son is right , sr. earl , that animal doesn' t exist .
my embalmer in the garden of the king is very handy .
so you say the beast does not exist ... .. and we are idiots ?
i only say that ... people only used dragons or squirrels in books or poems .
lies are sometimes true if they are being told correctly .
watch out , my lord .
we might not understand you anymore now .
by the way , are you a philosopher ?
or worse ... an actor ?
i think the knight is mainly someone from paris .
enough about that beast .
shall we do some riddles ?
i just made a poem .
if mrs. earl allows ...
if it' s not immoral .
immoral ?
no , no .
it' s very chaste and sober .
it' s not far fetched .
just popped into my head .
it' s called " the wolf " .
i didn' t pay any attention to it .
without thinking of evil , i look at you
your secret glance strikes me .
the wolf , the wolf , the wolf
will i see you again soon ?
do you have any other mystical animals ?
u have an indisputable idea about me .
allow me to change that .
try it .
will you be attending duhamel' s battue ?
yes .
i forbid you .
it' s far too dangerous .
obedience is the first virtue of young women .
that young man is right .
it was on that day the biggest battle ever to be held in gevaudan took place .
the king promised 6 . 000 pound to the one who killed the beast .
thousands of peasants and soldiers joined the hunters .
during a few hours we forgot we were hunting the beast .
everyone got a map and a place to assemble .
we start at 7 .
go ahead .
my people have other things to do .
your generosity matches your courage and ...
enough .
i hope for your sake that we catch it this time .
that' s a certainty , sir duke .
what kind of racket is that ?
a beautiful weapon , not ?
i had it made by a weapons blacksmith in mende .
you understand that i wanted it custom made .
look ... ... even in paris you can' t find such bullets .
i mold them myself .
silver ?
you fear werewolves ?
no , but i want to leave a signature .
i' m a hunter .
its a passion that has cost me a lot .
what happened to you ?
i' ve learned that some predators need more then a bullet .
there' s more to curing gangrene then a prayer .
has a bear wounded you ?
a lion .
2 years in the marine made me travel a lot .
you don' t know africa , fronsac .
gentlemen ... my daughter is to blame .
i' il bring her here .
punish her accordingly .
a witch .
the daughter of the devil .
look at her , a demon .
she' s sick , she' s not possessed .
she' s not possessed .
the evil .
the sign of the devil .
bewitched .
make sure she doesn' t swallow here tongue .
she will suffocate .
she' s not possessed .
she' s not possessed i know
taxidermist , philosopher ...
and even a healer .
congratulations .
she didn' t come .
marquis .
and the people ?
superstitious .
nothing different than this place .
the indians eat the heart of their prey , for its strength .
is that why they are savages ?
in africa they eat the heart of their enemies .
sir duke , jean francois , move your people eastwards .
there you are .
your mother will be worried .
if i had listened to her , i wouldn' t be in the convent .
i know you don' t believe me , you' re a free thinker .
not when one is in love .
are you in love ?
ridiculous .
we hardly know each other .
you think that its about you ?
marianne .
she has to learn to ride like a woman .
practice never hurt anyone .
my father never sees any evil .
my son sees evil in everything .
people died here .
how do you know that ?
i hear their screams .
mani , stop that .
he' s right .
there was an army camp here .
when it was torched , 25 heretics died .
is he psychic ?
that' s not needed .
to observe is sufficient .
when i was little , i came to play here with my brother .
weren' t you afraid ?
he would protect me against the ghosts .
don' t you like the hunt ?
is that a crime around here ?
according to indian custom , you steal someone' s soul if you draw them .
does my soul interest you ?
why on foot ?
do you want to get mutilated ?
it' s my fault .
i ask nothing of you .
what was that ?
only a wolf .
and what if it was the beast ?
i don' t think it was , marianne .
thanks .
i hope the beast is one of the wolves .
they wont be eating anyone .
what a special person .
where did you find him ?
in canada .
it' s ...
how does one say it .
an acad ?
an indian .
an irok , from the tribe of the mohawks .
an indian ?
a real one ?
he doesn' t look like an indian .
make sure that you' re in saint alban tonight .
we' il entertain ourselves with your servant .
he' s not my servant .
what is he then , cursed ?
my brother .
how can you mix your blood with that of a savage ?
he who shares my discomfort , is no savage .
because of mani i was able to escape from the english .
i thought those animals were cannibals .
as you can see , sir intendant , mani is no animal .
would you be able to procreate with a woman of our race ?
all women are equal once the candles are extinguished .
yes , they' re clear of mind .
the indians slept with white men and had children .
we are equals .
that' s said hasty .
it' s a bit like with black men ...
what do you think of it , sardis ?
your blood brother must be a child of god .
you had him baptized ?
he didn' t ask me .
good .
you follow times closely .
mani has his own believe .
he was some sort of priest in his tribe .
do indians have priests ?
they are lost .
what is their believe ?
every human has a congenial with the animals .
a totem
nice , but i don' t understand .
would you mind ?
don' t be afraid .
it won' t hurt .
u ...
caribou ... thats some kind of deer .
yes , a deer .
what do you think ?
am i a deer by the horns or by somebody else ?
and my dear thomas ?
what is his .. ... totem ?
worm .
a book worm .
a snake ?
snake ?
with the indians , snakes stand for wisdom
wise snake .
and you , my lord intendant ?
a pig .
away with those wrinkles .
with those barbarians the pigs may represent nobility .
who is next ?
sardis ?
no .
no
and me ?
what am i ?
half a lion , half an eagle ?
change me in a lizard , so my arm will grow back on .
jean francois .
enough .
what' s wrong ?
am i going too far ?
let me , let me .
mrs. , would you ?
excuse me , but your tricks bore me .
i choose to withdraw , before you start dancing on a ball .
good evening .
that will relax you .
it' s not paris , but it' s the best mende offers .
and it sleeps better than in an inn .
they are all for you , gentlemen .
and we have a new ...
my dear marquis , come .
i' m expensive , gregoire de fronsac .
do we know each other ?
from here gevaudan looks small .
italian ?
a passage in this beautiful country .
i got some money .
thats not the only issue .
and ?
who did that ?
an irokese arrow .
your heart was not far away ..
maybe i am .. a man with luck .
and that ?
a bear .
and he didn' t love me .
you haven' t seen anything yet .
i have a dangerous job .
not all men have manners like you .
that' s a recollection on me .
that is a scandal in my house .
valentine .
what is this ?
i don' t sleep with wizards .
what does it mean ?
he got snakes on his body .
our reputation is at risk .
it' s nothing , it is an indian .
not a wizard .
i don' t want indians .
you hookers are difficult .
and , girls ?
who' s going with the redskin ?
i double the price .
i like his sketches ...
well , everything is gonna be alright ...
are you a wizard ?
are you going to sketch me ?
if your not honest .
several weeks passed ... ... and the soldiers couldn' t find the beast .
it was the 3th winter under his lordship ... ... and we knew the snow and the cold ... ... just like our weapons , would not make it stop .
think about the threatens god announced through moses ' mouth ..
i will come to you like a bear lost her whelps
i shall tear your children like a lion .. and send the beast that will consume you .. and your cattle , and will make ... deserts of your roads .
how long will you stay angry , lord ?
one candle per victim .
do you really think we live in a rational time ?
mercy .
i ask forgiveness .
mercy .
bless me .
what is it , my son ?
god punished me .
my children are gone .
i' m doomed .
we' re all doomed .
gather your men , we leave at once .
warn mani , i see you on the way .
good evening , friend of the wolves .
i' ve got something for you .
i would like to speak with you , marianne .
alone .
in 10 days my mother and father will both go away .
10 days ?
i am not as free as you are .
bring me the torch .
bring the torch .
the storm starts and they are tired .
we' d better go home .
no .
let' s find the girl .
i found the child .
captain , those traps you set catch more farmers than wolves .
your men are leaded by misuse of power .
and since your chase the wolf has killed 12 times .
i don' t understand .
it shouldn' t have escaped .
what ?
it shouldn' t have escaped .
and you , knight , do you know what kind of wolf it is ?
gentlemen ...
the only certainty i have , is that it' s not a wolf .
a wolf does not attack people .
i observed them in canada .
maybe there the wolves are different .
a wild wolf would attack anybody .
if it gets frantic , it will die in 2 weeks .
and still it' s running around here for 2 years now .
by the way , i saw wounds a wolf could never have made .
and i found , in a body of a victim , a piece of iron .
and ?
and ?
no animal has iron teeth .
is the beast not an animal then ?
well , how do we catch it ?
as we are talking , it kills people .
i think we should listen carefully to fronsac .
so , knight , you think the beast is not an ordinary animal .
i' m glad you admit its something extraordinary .
i don' t admit anything sir .
i only have my doubts .
knight , do you have something left to say ?
no gentlemen .
gentlemen , i received this from paris .
captain duhamel , his majesty was informed about your mistakes .. ... and i was asked to get you off this case .
you and your men leave at once to your regiment in langogne .
sir beauterne is already on his way to langogne .
his majesty gave orders to kill the wolf . ... and he is the only one who is allowed to hunt in the district .
gentlemen .
have you forgiven me ?
i would like to know my totem ?
do i say that properly ?
i would say ... ... a mermaid .
you are never serious .
i will ask your red skinned man .
and the beast ?
did you see it ?
no .
don' t you want to talk about it ?
i could only make some absurd suppositions .
when i say the beast is made of flesh and iron ... ... that it can think and disappear when it wants to .
what would you think ?
that our air would make you talk nonsense .
people would think that it hides for me .
you haven' t been long here and you already want to be finished .
did you think the beast would surrender that easily ?
maybe it' s scared of you .
am i so scary then ?
you enjoy a lot more from a difficult victory .
jean francois said you wanted to go to africa .
it' s a dream of a taxidermist who is fed up with the winter .
and you ?
don' t you want to discover other regions ?
the women have more duties then desires .
do you see sardis on the walls ?
does he keep an eye on you ?
no
it watches me .
alone with you in the park .
who knows what will happen .
come , the priest will catch a cold .
good night , knight .
good night , knight .
you' re in love .
i don' t know .
i know .
the maps ?
i didn' t need them for you .
let us drink .
to mrs. morangias .
why ?
her brother was there too that night .
did you sleep with him ?
with him ?
he is not to be touched .
he looks , he drinks ... ... and when he' s drunk , he talks in his sleep .
like all men .
do i talk in my sleep ?
what do i say then ?
do you know how florentine women keep their men at home ?
they give their husbands slowly working poison each morning . ... and each night an antidote .
men who sleep elsewhere will have a bad night because of that .
a women like you doesn' t need that .
and by the way , we' re not married .
make room for antoine de beauterne .. ... carrier of his majesty , who will release the region .. ... of the beast .
my lord , i am gregoire de fronsac .
oh i remember .
the servant of buffon .
the taxidermist and embalmer .
he sleeps with the intendant .
we have an appointment at 2 exactly .
his majesty asked me your opinion about your report .
complicated fables ...
i think the beast is a wolf .
tomorrow i will leave to investigate .
i don' t want you to join me .
why not ?
the king wants me to do it .. ... and me alone ..
i don' t need you to complete this .
you' il find a letter signed by buffon on the table .. ... and our beloved king .
i am inferior to him .
but believe me , it' s not ...
i read your report .
don' t waste energy for the beast anymore .
i will take care of it .
you can go .
come , come , come .
come .
a women from lorciere .
she came back from a party .
we lost it south of the mouchet .
it just disappeared .
knight , the beast attacked a women in saint alban .
god punished me , my children are gone .
no more than you i believe in monsters .
his snout was longer and the teeth are like knifes .
the only certainty is that it' s not a wolf .
it' s not an animal ?
a frantic wolf attacks everyone .
how do we catch it ?
no animal has iron teeth .
knight , you have to come at once .
i saw it .
he poured poison and said satanic words .
god knows how long this has been going on .
let him be .
it' s an indian remedy .
only our prayers can save her
but ....
she was not ...
a miracle .
tell me .
what happened to your brother ?
a man with the beast .
she doesn' t know what she is saying .
yes , my lord .
the beast is dead .
ten bullets .
it didn' t survive .
we brought the necessary .
start at once .
that' s not the beast .
start .
mr. beauterne is coming .
ridiculous .
this is not the beast .
like i said , mr. beauterne is coming .
i don' t like the way you work .
bye , knight .
leave us .
and , fronsac ?
don' t you like my beast ?
what' s the meaning of this ?
you know this is not the beast .
his jaws are twice as big as these .
you got everything to fix that .
i must bring the beast to paris , and i got this wolf .
you should make a beast for me .
do you want the king to believe ..
no , fronsac .
i carry out his will .
you should too .
that would be wise .
are you threatening me , my lord ?
on my age ?
you know who i am .
541 01 : 02 : 43, 760 > 01 : 02 : 46, 718 ... and you' re too intelligent to have yourself threatened .
if you do your job , the king will be grateful .
if you don' t do your job he will be very disappointed .
do you have everything you need ?
i' m counting on you .
see you soon .
