i didn' t want this to happen to you .
tell me .
ask i ching .
is this it ?
have a look .
is this what this is all about ?
no .
is this it ?
i make my own decisions .
you' re not even a good clown .
right .
this is all fake .
i' m not buying any of this .
you' re fucking nuts .
i don' t even know you anymore .
i' m just happy .
you' re fucking nuts .
don' t you understand ?
they' re taking you for a ride .
this is all fake .
nobody will buy this .
nobody can ... fuck .
don' t you understand what she' s like ?
you don' t even understand what she' s like , do you ?
i' m telling you i' ve seen many of them .
a soft goddam fairy .
soft chocolate on top and ...
goddammit ...
it' s not even your kid .
you don' t owe them anything .
no .
no .
you just happened to be around and that' s it .
somebody else fucks her , god knows who and you walk in and take care of things .
a nice boy like you .
how could you be a dad ?
you' re just a kid yourself .
how could you know anything about it ?
you know nothing about it .
you' il parade around here all summer , barefoot and then what ?
turn it off .
what did you say in helsinki ?
that you love her .
yes ?
what did you mean by it ?
that i love her , of course .
yeah , but what does it mean ?
i can' t explain it .
try .
i' ve tried .
i don' t have to .
it doesn' t go like that , joni .
i' ve seen it so many times , been involved ...
all the people i' ve seen ...
it just comes and goes , starts and dies out .
that' s it .
it' s all fake .
people say that they' re happy and doing good when they just don' t have the guts to break up .
would that make them happy ?
why would you be a goddam exception ?
at least they' d be independent , you know .
that' s all you have , yourself .
that' s all you' ve got .
figure out what you want and what you really think or feel about things .
that' s all you' ve got .
that' s what you' ve got to live with .
it' s just bullshit the full package they' re offering .
and you' re not buying ?
no .
and you shouldn' t either .
i' m not buying any packages .
don' t bet your entire life on such a card .
no thanks .
are you my brother ?
yes .
prove it .
i' m telling you : there is no secret around the corner .
that' s a fact .
you can find peace by denying everything .
nothing means anything , you have no will or dreams .
but you must know that it' s a dangerous road .
you' il share dad' s fate .
what fate ?
he went nuts .
he went crazy from the same stuff .
the same goddam i ching and other bullshit .
not true .
of course it is , ask mom when she gets here .
is she coming here ?
yes .
did you ask mom here ?
of course i did .
idiot !
this is not good , not at all ...
i think i figured something out .
yeah .
i don' t really care what happens to us , sanna .
i went to spain with a friend of mine .
we had been there for some weeks and ended up in san sebastian .
for some reason , i don' t remember why
i decided to spend a day alone and went to the beach .
i' d been there for a while when i noticed
leaning against the fence a really beautiful spanish girl .
she was eating an orange without using her fingers .
i can' t explain it any better .
anyhow ...
i started thinking what to do
and went for the old trick of asking for a light although i had some matches in my pocket .
we talked some german and some french and i felt really good around her .
then she told me that a friend of hers was having a birthday party in some mountain village and invited me there .
she kissed me lightly and left .
i went straight back to where we were staying and told my friend what had happened .
we started planning the future and how many kids i would have and where we' d live and what car we' d drive .
then we went to buy me a new shirt .
then the bus comes and it stops .
the doors open and some people get off .
i' m standing there and i realize that my feet are not moving .
i can' t move , i' m just standing there .
then i take off
go downtown and get drunk .
fuck ...
i' ve thought about it every week ever since .
i still don' t know if this was my chance of a lifetime .
or is this just some stupid longing
i can' t get rid of .
perhaps you' il understand what i mean by this .
bye , joni .
do what you used to do when we were kids .
what ?
the thing with your head .
no way !
no fucking way !
start the engine .
no , from here ...
is that what you meant ?
but check this ...
your turn .
thanks .
it' s joni' s .
i' m sorry if i messed things up for you here .
thanks .
this is sami moldakoff .
sorry , i know you' re busy but i have a question .
is it at all possible to recover from this illness without treatment ?
is it possible that such a miracle would happen ?
yeah ...
joni asked me not to tell you but i have to tell you before i go back home .
joni is ill .
he has leukemia and it has returned .
he should be in helsinki for treatments .
his doctor called me and told me to bring him back .
that' s why i' m here .
understand ?
the doctors say that without treatment his chances of survival are one in a hundred thousand .
i really don' t know what to do .
hey ...
joni keeps saying he' s fine and refuses to leave .
why are you sitting here ?
and sulking .
is rimma upstairs ?
no .
where is she then ?
i told her everything .
i don' t know where she went .
i had to tell her , dammit !
don' t you understand ?
joni !
did you find her ?
yeah .
well ?
why are you still here ?
i wanted to see you .
i' m leaving tomorrow morning .
sami .
sami !
sami !
i want out of here , now .
what' s wrong ?
joni ...
are you in pain ?
no .
sami moldakoff , we' re here to get a passport .
apply for one , i mean .
