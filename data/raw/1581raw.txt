the spirit of the plants can teach you the secrets of life
broken nose
if one day you decide to know yourself you' il have to choose the warrior' s path
you' il reach the darkness of your spirit
then , if you overcome your fears you will know who you are
broken nose " !

broken nose
are you joining us ?
i met a white psychic
he steals people' s souls
i must heal her i must do it right away
then she' il be free
would you leave us now ?
we will talk later
your demons are stronger than ever
they will soon reappear
now is not the time
i haven' t come here to listen to your sermons
i know what you wish to speak to me about
the sacred mountains
there' s an expedition they' re looking for gold from the sacred mountains
they have a map
no
there is another man
the one she met
he is not seeking gold
what are you worried about ?
what' s he seeking ?
the sacred power
our secret is threatened
he knows
i didn' t kill him he' s a victim of a vengeance
a white man says he was attacked
on his way to riata
it' s the scalp of the black man
he was headed for the sacred mountains
i' m taking him to runi
runi is not one of us the body belongs to us
i' m taking him to runi
i' m not your enemy
i' m not your enemy
go ahead !
chiricahua , kill me !
go ahead !
