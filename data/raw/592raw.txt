this is me .
or her .
that' s what we look like .
she' s different .
i' m different .
one day i realized i could no longer tell my dream world ... from my real world .
it felt to me that i was no longer one person ... but two .
i don' t know who i am anymore .
hey , you actually got it .
hey , wait !
wait !
mommy , look . raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens  bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens  brown paper packages tied up with string  these are a few of my favorite things
oh , that was so great .

and keep my daddy safe with you and love him .
mommy ... c could you lay in bed with me until i fall asleep ?
sure , honey .
i' d love to .
get your stuff out .
let' s put your goodies away .
july has brought the onset ofstorm season ... as hurricanejulie pounded the eastern seaboard .
hardest hit was the town of new halifax on the coast of maine .
normally a quiet vacation community ... it is now an endless sea ofdebris , broken homes and broken dreams .
with winds in excess of 1 00 miles per hour ... the storm hammered boats and homes for hours .
hello ?
oh , hey .
no , i can' t bring you .
because ex boyfriends are very awkward for business ... and especially for the clients .
yeah , even almost exes .
thursday , uh , i think i' m in chicago .
but you know what ?
i don' t have my book in front of me .
if i had a sister i' d set you up with her , but you know ... that' s what you get for going out with an only child .
i' il call you later , okay ?
okay .
you' re late .
yes , i know .
thankyou .
i' il do throzen after chicago , okay ?
onjonathan' s cover i think the design isn' t half bad .
i think the problem is in the color .
but i' il call mcmillan .
that' s okay .
what' s this ?
aaron riley ?
mr. riley , it' s good to meet you .
we can get to the mr. riley stuff later .
let' s start out as aaron and marty .
please .
you' re here to ream me , marty .
we both have full schedules .
let' s get to it .
well , i don' t usually interfere with a client' s business manager ... particularly one as new to the client as you are .
but i' ve been unusually irresponsible ?
oh , no !
not at all .
i mean , considering you' ve only known ed ... six weeks ?
four and a half .
lucy schaefer lived with ed ... for three years less , actually .
during which time she was doing the deed behind his back .
hmm .
not a nice lady .
even he knows that now .
marty , it' s his money .
but ifwe give her that much of it ... how is this poor girl ever going to start building some character ?
what do you think , i represent this woman ?
i never saw the bitch in my life .
we talked it through , marty slow , careful and really complete .
it' s what he wants to do .
mr. riley ... don' t you believe in saving someone you care about from himself ?
no , ma' am , i sure don' t .
i' m not that smart .
thanks .
what are you doing in here ?
how did you get in here ?
i stole the key fromjennifer .
she told me to .
are you mad ?
no !
no , baby , i' m not mad .
you didn' t wake me up .
but your sister' s gonna be in big trouble .
yea !
no , no , no !
got you !
look at her, jessie .
god , she' s stubborn .
why won' t she ask anybody for help ?
i wonder .
help is on the way .
go , go , go !
whee !
you having a problem ?
no , mom .
i' m fii ne .
what' s funny ?
nothing' s funny .
nothing .
i
i like when you try hard .
especially at , uh , things you don' t thinkyou' re very good at .
mom , it' s not that .
okay , okay !
you know , sometimes when things come really easy to someone ... they think they have to be perfect at everything .
but we' re not perfect , are we ?
no .
do you know anything that' s perfect ?
so why would you want to be no one and nothing ?
do you think that' s me ?
yeah , i do .
' cause you' rejust like me .
nanny , nanny , boo boo !
you can' t catch me !
yes i can !
ohh , ouch !
damn it !
twenty minutes now .
we' ve discussed the rain and the roses and the hot cakes .
why do i feel you' re avoiding something ?
i' m so obvious .
god , i hate that .
mmm .
how' s the dream ?
no , i said that awkwardly .
how is new york today ?
new york was , uh , fii ne .
i' m not your shrink , baby .
i' m just the old girl who comes and drinks your whisky ... plays in your garden .
i don' t want to see him, jessie .
i don' t i don' t want to see any dr. langer .
we had a deal .
ayear ago , we said ... ifthis was still going on , i wanted you to see someone .
we said ?
you said .
and he' s actually viennese .
isn' t that perfect ?
you' re not giving up on me , are you ?
no .
as long as you still want me here .
no , until you tell me good bye , there' s hope .
and so , my good friend jessica tells me ... ofan interesting case of multiple personality .
martha ?
marie ?
here , it' s marie .
marie .
when you fall asleep at night ... in that instant you fii nd yourself waking in another world .
in another life , where your name is ?
marty .
hmm .
and what do you call this situation ?
a full life .
my goodness , yes .
one is tempted to ask , could it be too full ?
i have a psychiatrist in new york .
he thinks that i' m a manhattan career woman ... who dreams of being a mother in france .
see , that' s the problem with all ofyou guys .
you all thinkyou' re real , and i i don' t blame you .
well , we can' t all be real , can we ?
that would be impossible .
one world is real , the other a dream .
yes .
i know that .
but you do not know which .
why is that , i wonder ?
because if i ... realized which ...
life wasn' t real , then
well , um , the dream wouldn' t work .
it ... wouldn' t give me the satisfaction ofthat life .
i suppose it wouldn' t .
very ingenious ... but not without its dangers .
do you realize how deliberate you make this sound ... as ifyou could turn it on and off ?
you' re riding two horses ... and the mind is not built to do that ... without breaking apart .
i don' t i don' t know ... how to get back to the way i used to be .
viennese , no less .
yourjessie is really wheeling in the heavy artillery .
perfect , isn' t it ?
so , what did , uh
dr. peters , i really need to smoke today .
you don' t need to smoke .
do you mind if i have a cigarette ?
i could really usejust one .
no .
ah , you' re so great .
marty .
marty .
come on .
just one more puff .
please .
marty .
okay .
it' s going out .
so , dr. freud told you what ?
you should realize , he says , that new york has to be the dream world .
i mean , who would fantasize ... being a house bound mother and a widow at that ?
no romance .
that has to be real .
but new york ah .
glamorous career .
power .
self expression .
endless line of men wanting to date you .
every minute spent at your own whim .
now , ifthat' s not a dream , huh ?
he said it with less drama .
so , you say to dr. freud ?
please stop calling him that .
it' s dr. langer , and he' s as real as you are .
so , you told dr. langer what ?
my new york shrink ... thinks my life in manhattan is hard work hostile , adversary work ... with long , grinding hours .
that yes , there are a lot of men ... but no real , uh , romance ... no one to love me .
and i' m alone , and who would dream that ?
what about the loneliness ?
jessie said that ... a woman still grieving for her late husband ... isn' t ready to love anyone yet ... not even in their dreams .
okay .
i need to put you down so i can pay .
goodness !
sarah ?
sarah ?
sarah ?
seraphine ?
sarah ?
sarah ?
no , it isn' t .
why , sure it is .
we should go look foryour mommy .
she' il be worried .

i told you not to run off like that .
oh , goodness .
you scared me .
you know her ?
my mommy .
oh .

you like my hat ?
yes , honey , i do .
i like your hat very much .
but you should give it back now , okay ?
oh , it' s clean .
i made it for her .
well , then i guess you' ve got yourselfa new hat .

the butcher pointed you out .
and i realized you were the one who gave me that fantastic review .
figures .
you know what this guy really is ?
what ?
he' s the chance to love again .
see , you' re starting to come out ofyour coma ... and it terrifiies you .
in new york , you sleep with men you don' t love and feel safe .
now along comes william , you feel a pull ... and you react ... in your dream by creating this accountant .

oh yeah ?
oh , yeah .
i' m not interested in dating you .
you' re not .
i don' t enjoy rejection enough to wait in line for it .
and i' m not the kind of guy who attracts you .
and what kind of guy is that ?
handsome , but with enough edge to make it a little dangerous .
someone powerful who can sweep you offyour feet .
who you can control ... only by leaving ... which is , ofcourse , the safest control ofall .
ofcourse .
my turn ?
sure .
so , what are you interested in ?
you .
just who you are .

worry' s very , very constructive .
y yeah .
yeah .
yeah , but um
i want you to read it .
god , what an awful line .
i want you to read it .
i want you to be crazy about it .
ifyou could manage that without actually reading it ...
i' d do anything foryou .
is it good ?
well , no , not entirely ... but there are things in it that are are very good .
christ , i just want you to read it .
and i want you to have this ... this look ... this , uh , this flushed look ... ifyou can imagine that .
and i want you to think ...
what a guy .
a guy who can ... can feel like that , i wonder how he' d
make love ?
yeah .
and even more serious stuff .
i' d like to come home with you .
i' d like to say yes .

it' s a deal .
so , usually wednesday lunch .

because i like you too much , and we both know it .
well , it doesn' t mean we have to wear it .
but on you ... it looks good .
i have something foryou .
it' s a it' s not technically an heirloom , but ... it' s very precious to me .
no , no , no .

you can' t open it till you' re all alone .
oh , this guy .

yes , hold the fennel .
hold the fennel , hold the zinc .
so , what else did your mommy tell you about me ?
she says you write stories .
uh huh .
do you live in new york ?
no .
why new york ?
she knows a writer in new york ... and i want her to show him all her stories .
her stories ?
your mommy reviews other peoples ' stories in the new york times .
she doesn' t write her own stories .
counsel leading the witness .
that' s overruled .
she has her stories .
in a box in a closet .
don' t you want to see them ?
in a box ?
how about this weather ?
look at these cumulus clouds .
boy , are theyjust something .
are you sure there' s clouds up there ?
because i don' t see any .
get real .
how about what' s in the closet ?
in the box .
gonna let me see them ?
wish i could .
it' s the wrong way around .
i hate to break up this beautiful romance ... but it' s time for bed .
mom , it' s too early .
oh , no .
i think it' s quite late .
all right , you .
night night , mama .
don' t forget about me .
not hardly .
there' s something about your girls , about being with them .
i guess children make you a real person .
do they ?
i think so .
they have to be real .
they see .
yeah .
you okay ?
yeah .
sometimes i wish you didn' t look like you do .
why ?
because people who look like you have learned not to trust .
i can' t .
i can' t .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
don' t explain it .
while you feel like that , even if it' s forever , don' t fii ght it .
i want to make love to you .
i think about it all the time .
but in a way , in a real way ...
i' m afraid .
all my life , sex never really brought me closer to
usually it was the beginning ofthe end .
and i don' t want this to end .
this house , those children , your warmth .
everything about you .
don' t let me do anything to lose that , okay ?
now , walk me to my car .
are you gonna come back in the morning and make me breakfast ?
why ?
i' m going somewhere ?
afraid the kids will see me ?
i could say that .
or i could say it' s ... because of my husband .
but it' s something else .
ifsomeone was to be with me ... and woke me up , something bad might happen .
it' s it' s very crazy , and ...
i can' t tell you about it .
can i have that much mystery ?
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
i' il leave .
mmm .
well , you i could maybe stay awake another hour or so .
ifyou played your cards right ...
i could almost even make it three .
hello !
um , hey .

and ifyou do , and you want to go ...
i' il completely understand .
i have a whole other life , in france .
and that' s not even the bad part .
the bad part is , um ... that both lives are so ... equal ... and so real to me that ... well , i don' t know which one is the dream and which one is real .
i don' t even know ifyou' re real .
are you sitting there saying , " shit .
how fast can i get to the door ?

i like that .
i can say , " marie , you seem happy .
i like that even better .
but ifyou' il forgive an intrusion from the real world for a moment ... why did you tell aaron about your condition ?
i had to tell someone .
maybe we could let aaron be your analyst , and i' il do your taxes .
that was a very distancing thing to do .
look , marty , aaron seems like a nice man .
you like him .
maybe not romantically , but you seem close .
ofcourse , telling someone you' re mad as a hatter ... doesn' t usually bring them any closer .
mad as a hatter " ?
it' s a medical term i like to use .
listen .
why don' t you keep william in your dreams and in this offiice ... and away from everybody else ?
i' m funny about birthdays too .

she wasjust in the weirdest mood .
stories .
from a box in the closet .
jennifer gave them to me after dinner .
she said they were beautiful , and i should read them .
it should be our secret .
i didn' t read them , ofcourse .
she' s very proud ofyou .
what she did taught me something ... about what your dream really is .
you said whatjen did taught you .
in your dream , marty can do what she wants .
she can work with what she loves ... and give herselfto it , and it' s okay .
she doesn' t have to ... hide it ... in a box ... in a closet .
every night i go back to a room ... and i lie there ... and i think about you .
when i dream , i dream about you .
i know what you' re saying .
no , you don' t .
i do .
i do .
the hell you do .
it' s all built around you .
those people in new york they' re all you .
you' re analyzing yourself .
you' re courting yourself .
you' re making love to yourself .
it' s all my fault .
i' m sorry .
i said more than that .
i heard everything you said .
all of it and it' s right .
how long did he give you ?
he didn' t say .
now .
you don' t have to lose the whole dream . just the man .
why do i have to lose anything at all ?
i don' t want to give up either ofthem .
you don' t have that choice .
you' re not playing alone anymore .
the real one will leave .
and when he does , you' il know the other one is the dream which means you' ve lost him too .
this is your moment .
you' ve got to go for it .
i don' t know i don' t know if i can .
yes , you can .
i can' t let you be safe anymore .
choose .

so , what did you dream last night ?
what does he look like ?
is he dark ?
strong ?

please don' t do that .
how does he make love to you ?
where ?
how do his hands feel ?
his lips ?
does he get to stay the night ?
well , tonight he can .
what is it , uh , sarah says ?
don' t forget about me .

i just don' t .
why tonight ?
what' s back there ?
nothing , nothing , nothing .
you can' t stay awake forever .
jesus .
it' s one goddamn pill .
you know , you don' t have to go there tonight .
you could go someplace else .
tahiti , maybe .
maybe you could
maybe you could take me along .
' cause i' ve never been there , and maybe we' d have a hell ofa time ... and you could you could tell me all about it over breakfast .
and maybe i want to be alone .
and i don' t want to be alone .
i don' t .
and i' m afraid not to be alone .
and i want you to stay .
why ?
why do you ever have to go back there again ?
because my babies need me .
look at this .
wow !
what a sweetie .
thankyou .
i' m really good , aren' t i ?
you are good .
uh huh .
what' s this ?
where did you get this ?
just looking around on the bookshelf ... for whatever snooping , basically .
i noticed that tin box on one ofthe shelves ... so i peeked inside .
you found this here ?
yeah .
right on the shelf .
you know last night , before i came in ?
i lay there , on that incredibly comfortable bed ... and i tried to hearyou breathing .
couldn' t .
started thinking about how close you were .
figured i' d just come over to the bed .
i' d see you .
and you know , i was
at fii rst i was afraid .
like , ifyou woke up , i' d disappear .
i actually thought that .
i really did .
well , i guess it worked out .
you' re here .
yeah .
wherever that is .
these were , um ... my mother' s .
and , um , these are hers too .
she , uh , wore them together .
nice pictures .
this is when i was fiive ... and this one' s when i was about ... ten , eleven , i think .
you haven' t changed much .
i' m gonna be late .
i gotta go .
why ?
just thinking about my best friend .
she sounds pretty high maintenance .
i don' t know .
could be quite a loser .
you might want to dump her .
no , she' s not a loser , just ... someone who needs to run when things aren' t perfect ... and love is never perfect , is it ?
and ifyou really care about someone ... really care , then you have to respect who they really are .
i know who you are .
you' re the little girl whose mama died in france ... when she was 1 1 .
one time you said
you said , don' t i believe in saving someone ...
i care about from himself , and i said , " no , ma' am .
i sure don' t .
i' m not that smart .
i would rather be your best friend than the guy ... that made you give up any part ofyourself .
i really would .
that' s what i aspire to be when i grow up your best friend .
so , ifyou need to run ... you should .
mommy ?
mommy ?
mommy ?
mom ?
mommy , what' s the matter ?

it' s okay .
why did you bring me back ?
i had to see you one more time .
i had to say good bye .
oh , i love you .
i know .
who knows what dreams are made of ?
the kiss ofa childhood friend ... the roar ofa stranger' s car on a gravel road ... the absolute calm of my father' s voice ... the warmth of my mother' s arms .
you' re not drinking tonight ?
no , i' m ... talking tonight .
confessing , actually .
you go ahead .
i can keep a secret .
remember ... how you said you wouldn' t give up on me ?
uh huh .
you won' t , will you ?
promise me you won' t , ' cause i couldn' t do it without you .
so i guess my big secret ... is that i love you like crazy , mom ... and i always will ...
