i didn' t think god would let a miss work on sunday .
i have to be open for business before the casino is .
i' m trying to identify this gal .
you haven' t seen her , have you ?

i guess you wouldn' t know her , would you ?

i' m trying to find out .
so how' s school , honey ?

can i get a tattoo ?
a tattoo of what ?
gaia . what' s gaia ?
gaia , the earth goddess .
when i was a kid , the girls who had a tattoo worked in tit shows .
don' t walk around like trash .
thanks .
c. b. to big t one .
you copy ?
we' re over at the doc' s .
you got to see this .

damn , squeegee .
wait until you see this !
you ain' t supposed to be in here .
you just wait .
what' s going on ?
she' s got a pecker .
and teeties .
don' t say that , c. b. jesus !
she' s got a bigger dick than i do .
squeegee , i' il have to take your word on that .
oh , lord !
you call it a" transvestite " .
technically ... because of the hormone induced breasts , she' s a" transsexual " .
a transvestite just likes to dress up .
an accident ?
no .
this is the copper that killed her , or him .
22 caliber , shot to the back and lodged in the chest cavity .
feet are cut up , so ...
i feel she ran a long way with this in her .
the actual time of death probably just 45 minutes ago .
asphyxiation .
lungs slowly filled up with the blood .
damn , darl .
she was alive while we were unloading those shoes .
jesus as a tattoo ... but this here , that' s a stamp , like you' d get in a nightclub .
homicide .
you should' ve called investigators before moving her .
excuse me , mrs. district attorney , i was called for the accident .
i didn' t have any idea ...
wow !
that ' s cool !
what ?
get back in the car !
she' s riding back with me .
come .
what ?
i wish to hell she hadn' t proposed to me .
it would' ve been easier .
it ' s my fault you' re miserable . that' s what i said .
you' re getting any alimony ?
i should .
put her through school .
doc , won' t you put some over this .
i always love this bit .
those goodies look so real .
they are real .
what do you think ?
they' re not exactly real .
they' re weren' t real .
they' re real now .
they sure are pretty .
hey , cut that out .
seems you know a lot about this .
i' ve read a lot .
i' m sorry .
i just read a lot .
i don' t know what the deal is .
we don' t want to know what' s going on ...
behind closed doors .
stop that .
i' m going back to the desk .
want me to call the state forensics ?
why ?
carla said we should' ve done it .
i don' t give a rat ' s ass .
call in the state boys on a sunday ... to investigate a" homocide " ?
they don' t give a shit .
have you seen my sunglasses ?
no .
shit !
good morning , lana , how you doing ? ls the judge home ?
he' s out back .
take the baby bear .
mr. grandpa bear .
he' s got a tie on .
you' ve got your hands full .
daughter thinks i' m a babysitter .
i have done nothing to dissuade her of that notion .
we have a policy problem with darl i should let you know about .
that d. o. a.
darl doesn' t want to call in the state investigation unit .
darl can be mule headed .
he should' ve checked with me before stealing those shoes .
i mean it' s been years since darl has handled a murder case .
the first 48 hours are crucial .
some crime investigations don' t deserve the tax payer' s money .
this is one of them .
i beg your pardon ?
having the wrong kind of publicity in le salle at the wrong time .
with the casino pendent ?
i know we shot it ... but , right now , darl just might be the best man for the job .
pretty precious !
i missed you .
i was just gone for a minute and i missed you .
good grief !
darlene , this milk stinks !
there' s creamer in the cupboard .
i don' t like that powder shit .
this lady ...
she would like to speak to a sheriff or a deputy .
hi .
my name is darl .
pleased to meet you .
are you the sheriff ?
yeah .
except i don' t use my gun unless the charm fails , you know ?
i' m worried about a friend of mine .
you' re not from here , are you ?
why do you say that ?
because you look better than the people around here .
no .
i drove up from new orleans .
how' s everything down there ?
it ' s fine .
you get down there much ?
lf i got a good reason , i go down there every now and then .
yeah , i' m worried about my girlfriend .
she called me ...
saturday from le salle .
i haven' t heard from her since .
this might not have anything to do with it , i don' t know ... but did she happen to have a ...
a what ?
it ' s ...
a jesus tattoo ?
where are we going ?
across the street .
full name ?
mona .
mona what ?
she just had one name .
i felt something was wrong .
what happened ?
got shot .
we found her at a swamp .
who did it ?
i don' t have a clue .
do you ?
listen , this sex question over here is a little problem .
what box should i check ?
however you like .
alright , both boxes .
next keen ?

are you like her sister or something like that ?
i' m her wife .
legal ?
legal .
i' m sorry , i just ...
i never really ...
hey !
i' m sorry , but it' s strange for me .
i don' t see it every day .
ma' am , this is a murder case .
i' il have to ask you some more questions , so ...
ask !
what was she , or he ...
she !
alright , what was she doing in le salle ?
mona called our house on saturday night and left a message ... around 3 .
she said ... she was working in a christmas party in le salle and ...
her ride left her stranded and in the morning she would catch a bus .
sunday came and she didn' t come home .
monday i started to worry .
i called everybody ...
nobody heard from her .
last night , i drove up here .
that' s it .
that' s all i know .
where was this party at ?
i don' t know .
she' s an entertainer , she performs a lot of parties .
what was she driving ?
doesn' t have a license nor a car .
where did she call you from ?
i don' t know .
how about this jesus tattoo she had on her ? what' s that about ?
a few years ago , she went through this religious phase ....
she got this tattoo .
jesus over her heart .
what about that stamp on her hand , that j. a. ? what' s that ?
johnny angels " , a nightclub in new orleans where we work .
both of you work there ?
are you the same as she is , you know ?
what does that have to do with my husband being murdered ?
c. b. , what do you want ?
sorry , but we got an emergency .
there' s a protest at the casino site and ...
your daddy' s got a shotgun .
of course he has .
would you mind waiting in my office ?
i got to take care of this .
get back here !
this was to a be a nice protest .
nobody invited him to show up .
you hear me ?
he won' t let me near him .
he' s going to kill somebody .
hey , it' s me !
put the gun down !
i' ve seen better sheriffs in saturday morning cartoons !
there he is , god himself .
mr. own it , mr. buy lt .
well , these raisins ain' t for sale !
bull , you stupid drunk , put that gun down !
stay back !
he' s crazy !
all bark and no bite !
flatter than yesterday' s beer .
you are gone .
there' s nothing left .
i' m a dangerous man .
i' m a killer !
lf you were to kill me , you' d have killed me a long time ago .
give me that gun .
get him out of my site .
come on , daddy .
get up .
get off this hill , damn it .
what are you doing shooting at things ?
i don' t believe it would do any good to lock him up .
do you ?
how are you coming with that freak murder ?
we made an l . d. she came from new orleans .
i figured .
all shit that floats ends up in new orleans .
that' s for sure .
darl , i don' t want you to make too much noise with that case .
i' d hate to have the newspapers stick the words le salle parish ... and transsexual murder in the same headline .
i hear you .
see if you can talk some sense into that alcohol soaked head .
all right .
that son of a bitch !
that judge' s a tad wacker , that' s what !
he' s brought up every land this side of the lake , except mine .
and i' il fry in hell before i sell out to that son of a bitch !
no , sir , not for fort knox !
when he asked for my badge , i thought " how bad can that be " ?
it ' s only a piece of tin .
i didn' t realize that that badge ... was my skin .
it held me together .
don' t let him do that to you .
don' t have to worry about me .
i don' t .
your brother took the wrong turn .
took after your momma .
but you are me .
big chief to station 1 .
station 1 .
tell that scarlet person to go back to new orleans .
i' m tied up .
she' s left already .
but she wasn' t going back to new orleans .
she said she was going by the bus station ... see if anybody had seen her husband .
over .
all right .
i use 2 sticks of butter .
no more , or it doesn' t taste right .
plus , it puts pounds on you .
i think i could use a few pounds .
sheriff ?
can i help you ?
how you doing ?
all right .
i was looking for somebody .
she was looking for somebody too .
then we got to discussing shortbread recipes ...
sorry i couldn' t help you with your friend .
i' il keep an eye out .
thank you .
sure .
who are you looking for ?
i think i know where to find them .
all right .
i thought i told you to wait for me at the office ...
thought i could help .
it turns out mona never bought a bus ticket .
yeah , well ...
okay ...
that' s you right there ? what' s your sign ?
your astrological sign ?
capricorn .
stubborn .
selfish and stubborn .
i' il handle everything from here .
just go back to new orleans ...
look , you think that mona belongs in a petri dish ... but you' re wrong .
mona was the best person i ever met .
the gentlest person .
never put on errors , kind to everyone .
you think that' s easy , the choice that she made in her life ?
it isn' t .
she' s the bravest person i' ve ever met .
so , you put your prejudice aside ... and swear to me you' re going to find out who did this .
okay , we' il handle that , right off the bat .
that ' s what we' il do .
ho , ho , paradise casino has got to go !
i want 3 of whatever those deals are .

how you doing ?
this must be the husband you' re always running down .
hey , i told you to behave .
let ' s hear it for the governor !
thanks .
i want to talk a couple of minutes about le salle parish .
not like my opponent , hart burnson , or as i call him ...
heartburn , son !
he' s marching marionettes right outside that door .
paradise casino has got to go !
you know me ?
no , i don' t think so .
you tried to fuck me .
i own a picking pan in shreeport .
this is a shipping invoice .
you stole us$ 2o, ooo worth in my shoes .
i don' t know anything about it .
my driver says you were there .
well , your driver ought to be a better driver , you know what ?
my brother in law is the attorney general .
he' il rip you a new one .
i don' t know who you think you are , but this ain' t shreeport .
so you' d better keep your finger out of my face !
burnson doesn' t want jobs for you .
you know what ?
they' re going to vote you off the ticket .
did they tell you yet ?
good party , judge .
darl , how are you doing ?
you' re cutting me off the ticket ?
where did you get that idea ?
don' t bullshit me .
easy , darl .
you easy !
get your fucking hands off of me !
you' re embarrassing yourself .
don' t fuck with me in my parish !
you need to calm down , hear me ?
get your nose out of his ass !
always good to see you , darl .

thanks for coming .
merry xmas .
merry christmas to all of you .
what is everybody looking at ?
just enjoy yourselves .

some girls are spitters , but i' m a swallower .
i guess i' il carry you .
where are you going to take me ?
where are we going ?
take off my boots .
hello ?
sheriff ?
who is this ?
scarlet .

i got the number mona called from .
it ' s on my new phone bill .
you got a pencil ?
yeah , i got one .
okay, it' s 294 367 2 .
got it ?
i called there a bunch of times .
nobody ever answers .
this is kind of late .
i don' t know what to do with her things .
have you ever lost anybody close ?
yeah .
i' m sorry .
so , good night .
good night .
hey , carla .
listen ...
i said some pretty ugly things last night .
i made a fool out of myself .
yes , we all remember very well .
i remember pretty well .
i' m very sorry .
she' s watching us , so let ' s be civil with each other .
what are you doing for christmas ?
drive up to your momma' s ?
no , because i only get a day off .
it ' s too far to drive .
she won' t speak to you .
at least try to do that .
yeah , i guess not .
darl , there were a lot of phone calls made about you last night .
phone calls don' t scare me .
lf you heard them , you' d be .
watch your back .
let me make a deal with you : invite me over for christmas .
i' il bring a tree , a turkey and fruit cake .
we' il have a big ...
you think you can act like an ass , show up and everything be fine ?
you don' t get off for free .
you' re a cop , you should know .
lf you want to come over in the afternoon to see ashley , fine .
there' s a party in baton rouge i' m going to .
ls that right ?
i bet the governor will be there .
move your car .
hey , judge .
let ' s just get right to the point .
lf you' re taking some heat , i' il call the governor right now .
last week i visited an elementary school and i saw this girl ... on a computer talking to kazakhstan .
i' m not smart to know where it is , but i know things are changing .
what was good enough for le salle parish 1o , 2o years ago ...
i don' t have a clue what you' re talking about !
not a fucking clue !
well , there it is , in a nutshell .
the party is running jackson for sheriff .
ls that right ?
that ' s right .
well , i' m running . lf i have to run against you and the party .
your father tried that once with very little success .
don' t talk about my father , okay ?
you and him both can kiss my ass !
that ' s exactly it .
excuse me , it' s real quick .
lucy , i need that voter petition for elective office .
all right .
thanks , honey .
sure , darl , i' il sign .
you' re a good man .
i' il tell that to everybody .
always good to see you , darl .
you told all sorts of lies to get elected .
they' il all catch you " .
what do you say , goose ?
i' ve already signed for jackson .
i understand .
sorry , darl .
keep trash of my parking lot .
you got it , henry .
i really appreciate it .
ornelle ... you' re going to go blind looking at that nookie .
i' m looking for my car catalogue .
he' s been looking for it for half an hour .
i need you to sign something for me . what' s wrong with him ?
hey , sister , are you going to sign for me ?
well , what are your views about the state supporting gambling ?
what does it have to do with it ?
well , our governor ... who coverts with harlots on the sabbath , our sheriff steals shoes .
come to think of it , i think jackson might be the better man .
know what i' m beginning to think ?
that i liked you a lot better ... when you smoked all that reefer and went fucking in your pinto .
the lord' s arms are big enough to embrace all who' ve fallen down .
i think you' d better get with it .
so you' re not going to sign it ?
there were a lot of phone calls made about you last night .
watch your back .
red light usually means " stop " !
goddamnit !
you little shits stay out of the road , you understand me ?
i don' t think i can keep my shoes .
scarlet called 3 times .
did you know jackson is running this year ?
well ?
yeah , i heard .
c. b. , i gave him his job .
and you know damn well that he' s going to get all the black vote .
i don' t know what he said , but his deputy will come from swamp town .
c. b ...
i need you on my side .
i found your sunglasses , darl , on the back seat of my wife' s car .
hello ?
sheriff' s office .
i' ve done everything you' ve ever asked of me ... haven' t l ?
darl , it' s that scarlet person again .
pulled a fast one , did he ?
i told you .
it was just a matter of time .
he did it , you know ?
who did what ?
killed that freak .
you mean the judge ?
who else ?
nobody squeezes a shit without his thumb prints in it .
he' s running the nigger to fill your slot .
what will you do ?
i didn' t raise you to roll over , buddy boy .
why don' t i just bitch and moan and soak myself to death ?
let the record show i never missed one day at work .
not one , no sir !
go ahead , run , you son of a bitch !
come on , boy !
come on !
come here , buddy !
all right .
feeding the little doggies ?
how' s it going , cletus ?
good .
ls it about 8 days till hunter season ?
yes .
it ' il be in about 8 days .
was that dog at the wreck ?
yes , sir .
that ' s buster there .
he must have heard the breaks squealing .
busted loose .
hey , darl !
you look lost .
i walked in from the highway .
how are you all guys doing ?
hey , sheriff , what you got there ?
it ' s a shoe i found in the woods .
it might belong to that freak .
i thought you weren' t so interested in that case .
well , i' m getting more interested in it .
you have a party saturday ?
why are you asking ?
i don' t know .
i guess i thought i might get invited to it .
you' re not a member .
hey , sheriff ... when you catch him , you' il lock him up or give him a medal ?
i don' t know .
i haven' t decided it yet .
good seeing you .
don' t be bitten by snakes walking in the woods .
i' il try .
hey , marcus !
what are you doing in my car ?
darl hardwick , move over to the car , place your hands on the roof .
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
for what ?
taking shoes ?
statutory rape .
what are you talking about ?
the girl you brought to the party was fifteen .
i didn' t touch her .
that ' s not what she said .
i don' t give a shit to what ...
darl !
let me see your gun and up with your hands .
here' s my hands up .
what are you going to do ?
right .
excellent .
you marginal piece of shit !
up against the car !
what are you looking at , marcus ?
you' re some kind of friend , huh ?
i can get in the fucking car .
get in there !
hey !
hey !
it smells like shit in here !
oh , man !
here goes this up .
i' m recusing myself from the case .
we' re bringing in another prosecutor .
carla , i didn' t do anything to that little girl .
they must ' ve paid her off to lie about me .
that ' s all i ...
i read her deposition .
you' il need a really good lawyer .
i' m happy to make some recommendations .
they' re trying to push me out , that' s all this is about .
the freak case can hurt them .
i read her birth certificate .
she was fifteen .
everybody saw you leaving with her .
she' s ashley' s age .
you just live in your own play pen with your own rules , don' t you ?
i can' t shop without people looking at me like i' m pathetic .
i' m not pathetic , you' re pathetic !
i married a good man ... but these last several years i' ve been miserable .
where did you go ?
it was a set up .
i can prove it .
we dropped to a lessercharge , attributed to delinquency .
throw out the statutory rape .
and you get out on 12 months probation .
darl , i' m trying to keep you out of jail .
for a cop , it' s a felony offense .
i' il piss away my law enforcement career .
i saw you serve that girl drinks .
that ' s against the law .
the condition is you can' t leave the parish without permission .
howdy .
need a ride ?
a ride with who ?
gizmo .
i play a zodiacal accordion on an anti gambling website ... and i' m a good friend of your good friend sister felicia .
this is mark , my unpaid intern .
that party at tidewater .
i heard a rumor the governor was there .
they say in louisiana politics the only way you can get reelected ... if you get caught with a dead girl or a live boy .
our governor' s done the combo .
you work for burnson ?
who i work for is not as important as getting out the truth .
you know the state police moved your d. o. a. to baton rouge ?
records on the case were sealed .
i' ve been kind out of the loop .
i heard .
you possess a special gift , darl .
i' m talking about the ability to bring politicians to their knees .
i can help you get even .
i don' t need any help .
it ' s a rough league , bubba .
sooner or later ... at this level , everybody needs help .
can you tell me where a bar named johnny angels is ?
you wouldn' t know where a place called johnny angels is .
us$ 5 .
only us$ 5 .
i' il read your tarot .
so , is he dead ?
no .
not officially , no .
have you come in to do a little christmas shopping ?
i' m on a case .
i thought you might know where johnny angels is .
you' re a little out of your jurisdiction , aren' t you , sheriff ?
nice place you' ve got , though .
this is luna , my partner .
this is darl .
my , my , the sheriff !
oh , we' ve heard about you .
well , i' m not a sheriff anymore .
there' s a story right there .
any freak on the street can tell you where johnny angels is .
why did you come in here , darl ?
well , it is christmas , you know ?
so i thought i' d just come by and say ...
maybe say you' re sorry ?
see if you were alive .
y' all got a lot of diseases .
how considerate of you .
good to know you haven' t changed a bit .
canal and belvedere street .
green door behind a warehouse .
merry christmas , darl .
yeah , merry christmas .
hey , gorgeous , look at you .
watch the nails .
what' s in the bag ?
it ' s a shoe .
let ' s see .
nice .
a stamp , like you' d get in a nightclub .
hello , cowboy .
you' re my little flower
flower , flower
i remember when
you were in my hands
time falls like a shower
when i see you , flower
there' s a place where grace
will take me to you
i' il breathe
through you
flower , fly
nice job , sugar .
thank you so much .
that was great , darling .
thanks .
hey , sheriff .
i' m not a sheriff anymore .
why ?
they caught you with your fingers in the cookie jar ?
i' m being set up for investigating the murder of your husband .
that ' s funny .
i can' t even get you to return my phone calls .
watch it ! what' s your problem , faggot ?
say you made a mistake !
relax , buddy !
listen , i' m breaking my parole to talk to you .
what do you want ?
a star on your forehead ?
a round of applause ?
did this belong to mona ?
no .
are you sure ?
i' m sure .
get the fuck out of the way !
stop !
stop !
what ?
i found out where the party was .
tidewater .
two years ago , a girl who worked in here was beaten to death ... with a tire iron , right here , on the side of this wall .
and the cops told me to my face that she deserved it !
lf i help you , will you go all the way with this ?
this is about real justice for mona .
so that' s her shoe back there ?
it ' s mine .
we wore the same size .
darl , could you hold my lipstick ?
my pocket ' s got a hole .
what' s happening , little momma ?
good to see you .
haven' t been here for a while .
we' re going to hop in and out .
this is my friend darl . what' s happening , darl ?
you think you could comp him ?
comp ?
it will cost you sugar .
it ' s okay .
just tell him what you told me .
i got friendly with a guy in baton rouge .
i won' t tell you who .
it ' s not in my best interest .
once a month he pays us to put on a lingerie show in le salle .
it ' s a deal .
you ain' t got to do nothing you don' t want to .
some girls make dates to make extra cash .
i' m not that greedy .
at the tidewater ?
it ' s okay .
he needs to know .
i' il never say this in court .
we finished up our show , counted up our tips and we' re leaving .
it ' s 2 : 15 .
i always check to see how long the ride back takes .
we almost ran over her .
she was walking away from the club .
i really didn' t even know it was mona until you told me , sweetie ... that it was in le salle that she was found .
and the governor was there ?
we' re well paid to say " no " to that question .
well , i hate to see a pretty woman standing all alone .
you didn' t answer my question .
what question was that ? what' s the deal with darl ?
you know more about his situation than i do .
it is a local matter .
somebody paid that girl .
lf it wasn' t her , it ' d be the next .
or the drinking or the graft .
you know he wouldn' t have done anything that hadn' t been done .
are you telling me you want me to turn the clock back ?
18 . 5 % of my appointments have been to women and minorities .
nowadays , a smart , qualified woman like you ... has a place in louisiana public service .
but not darl .
so how could mona model lingerie ?
you saw her , brownie .
she had the body for it .
no , i don' t mean that .
i mean ...
when the big cadillac bump in the road there you might notice .
here' s how you do it , darl : you tuck it in between your legs ... and put on a little g string .
all right ...
so what' s next , inspector ?
the phone number mona called you from , do you have that ?
did you lose it ?
it ' s in a file at the office .
well , i know it by heart .
i memorized it .
maybe you' il have better luck .
are all the girls here lesbians ?
well , some of them .
now , you see the worst side of men working here .
so you worked here ?
yeah .
tips are good , money is good .
so do you have to do that tuck in job yourself , i mean ...
darl , it' s eating you up , isn' t it ?
hello ? ls this tidewater ?
no, l don' t think so .
this is darl hardwick .
who am i speaking to ?
darl , it' s me .
me who ?
you got the phone booth out front my place .
darl , i have never been paid for that shoe truck job .
i am not the sheriff anymore .
i can' t do anything about it .
i ain' t got no shoes either .
everybody got new shoes ...
i don' t got no new shoes .
we' il talk later about it . lwant to ask you something important : do you know that d. o. a we found at the swamp ?
she made a call from your phone booth at 3 am .
did you see her ?
sundays i don' t open till 8 .
excuse me , i need to run your credit card .
ornelle , listen , i' ve got to get going .
bye bye .
i ain' t getting no new shoes .
tell me something personal .
you don' t want to hear that .
no ...
no ...
my daddy is a crazy drunk .
well , like father , like son .
i' m not either .
i drink like everybody else does , you know ?
what about your momma ?
i never really knew her .
she died when i was pretty young .
my daddy didn' t know how to take care of kids really so ... me and my brother pretty much were raised by my grandparents .
well , what' s your brother like ?
he' s ...
he' s different .
i don' t know .
my mother' s death kind of affected him differently .
probably more , really .
how so ?
he turned out ... just a little off somewhere , i don' t know .
problematic kid , really .
he' s ...
i' il put it this way : when they asked me to run for sheriff ... they said they' d badge me only under one condition : that i' d run my brother out of the parish .
so ...
who' s they ?
the people who sign my checks .
so i ran him out of the parish .
but that' s not helping us connect the governor to mona , is it ?
i' m going to try to do something .
you can' t drive home like that .
look , i' ve got a couch , okay ?
it ' s got " darl " all over it .
flower
come to me
winter is almost here
lf you drink water before you go to bed , the room won' t spin .
thanks .
are you sure you don' t want a pillow ?
no , i' m alright .
frankly , i' m just glad to have a couch .
sweet dreams .
you too .
good night .
i just ...
darl ...
i just ...
it ' s too soon .
i can' t .
no , i know .
i was just ...
i was thinking about not being able to sleep or something .
wake up !
darl !
i thought you' d gone .
i forgot my keys .
you left them inside .
go inside and warm up .
i' il go fetch some coffee .
hello ?
hello ?
anybody home ?
oh ! ls mona here ?
i had an appointment at 9 .
are you running over ?
running over what ?
i' m going to come back later .
so you know , some old shit came by saying he had an appointment .
shoot !
it ' s one of mona' s monthly' s .
whatever operation it is , it' s disgusting .
did you see my keys ?
his name is mr. prestman , and he isn' t a freak !
he misses his wife , okay ?
they were married for 5o years .
she dies , so he misses her , so he likes to wear her dresses .
ls that so fucking horrible ?
that ' s perfectly normal .
your keys are on the mantel .
darl , what are you so afraid of ?
i think the whole damn situation here is a little odd .
really ?
you ran your own brother out of town . ls that normal ?
you don' t know my family !
girls get fucked by their dads !
you' re a stripper that lives with a freak !
call that normal ?
don' t talk about someone i love !
i talk about who i want to !
you wanted to fuck me and didn' t even know if i had a dick or not !
somebody who couldn' t deal with their sexual impulses killed mona .
shut up !
you shut up !
fucking freak !
get out of my fuckingway before i slap the shit out of you !
shut up !
mona , the d. o. a. , was sent here as a lingerie model .
i' ve got a witness that puts him at your gate at 2 : 15 ... and a phone record that puts him at a phone booth at ornelle' s ... a mile that away .
and ... there' s this little deal here .
i found this bloody shoe in your backyard .
that ' s it ?
no .
there' s a matter of your dog .
buster was found at the body .
nothing that would stick .
stand up .
ls that fun ?
oh , yeah .
you' re a sweetie .
he' s clean .
you know what an " imbroglio " is ?
no , i don' t .
that was one of my favorite words in college .
it means ...
" complicated situation " .
we had a party .
the kind that you don' t bring your wife to .
that freak could' ve passed for miss america .
maybe she was here , and maybe she wasn' t .
whatever , bottom line we did not kill her .
him .
cletus can tell you .
we were locked and cleared out by 2 : 3o .
when that truck driver saw that woman on the highway ... we were home with our wives .
burnson' s people are on my ass to go public .
lf the press gets a worth of that ... our governor partying with a transsexual who ends up dead .
he' s going to drop like a rock .
and your casino project too .
burnson probably set the whole thing up himself .
the members of this club are honorable men , darl .
you want that kind of enemies ?
i always wondered what it was like in here .
it smells like shit !
you threw a spit ball on my head .
wait a minute , darl .
i' m getting this thing overturned and my job back , i promise you .
you think you know what you' re doing , but you don' t .
really ? ls that right ?
lf by tomorrow the appeal board doesn' t reconsider my case ...
i' m going to press .
i' il call burnson quicker than shit .
sleep good .
what the hell do we do now ?
something they didn' t teach you at the kennedy business school .
darl , wait up there !
hold on , son !
we thought about it ... and we generally accept your demands .
we' il work in good faith to get your job back .
but there' s a loose end .
that scarlet person , does she know you know ?
she gave a false address on the death certificate .
you know how we can contact her ?
she' s in new orleans .
we know that .
i' il get you an address .
i' il give you a call .
the sooner , the better .
what' s wrong with you ?
so when you lost your badge , that' s it , you lost everything .
you got that right .
so whatever it takes ...
i mean , to get it back , that' s what i got to do , that' s about it ?
i never missed a day of work , i had a perfect record .
even after you cleaned her off the floor ?
what ?
who ?
that wasn' t my fault .
david always said you shot her .
that faggot is every bit as crazy as she was .
myself , i never believed you had the guts .
she pulled my chrome handled smith & wesson with a 6 inch barrel ... and was waving it at me , screaming her hysterical shit !
she was crazy !
she puts it right there to the side of her head .
that ' s when i said these last words : " go ahead , bitch , do it !
i made it into work the next day ...
i pulled a full shift ...
i had a perfect record .
here you go , sugar .
howdy , ma' am .
well , hello , cowboy .
i' m looking for scarlet .
she ain' t here .
she' s over that strip joint ?
maybe .
she said you' re the one trying to find the bastard who killed mona .
any luck ?
we' re making a little progress .
girls like me got a free shot bull' s eye on our backs .
lf you solve this one , it ' d be a first .
and you are so fine that i might give you that purple heart myself .
i' d appreciate that .
have a good day .
yeah , we' re here now .
i' il call you later .
all right .
she gave a false address on the death certificate .
you know how we can contact her ?
what' s happening , man ?
ls scarlet around ?
yeah , she' s here .
that' s us$ 1o .
scarlet is doing it foryou , working hard for appreciation .
show it by stepping up there and tipping that sexy lady .
hi , baby .
can i get you something to drink , baby ?
it ' s a 2 drink minimum .
everybody in the house put those hands together, make some noise !
forscarlet .
we' ve got to get out of here .
i' m not going anywhere with you .
the governor' s after you .
how do they know about me ?
don' t worry about that .
you can' t be back here !
i' m talking to her , all right ?
i don' t care what you' re doing !
i said i' m talking to her !
okay , i know him !
gitter , it' s me .
i know him .
i don' t give a fuck if he' s your dad !
we' ve got rules !
you can leave on a stretcher or you can leave like a gentleman .
come on , man .
hey , stop it !
fucker !
i told your mother fucking ass !
darl !
darl !
i' m going to call an ambulance .
oh , my god , you think you ...
look who we found !
stop it !
get up !
stop it !
come on !
let go , damn it !
just get in the car !
come on !
get off !
no !
get in there !
let go of her !
let her go right now !
get your hand away from your pocket !
right now !
take the keys !
go to the truck !
calm down , buddy !
i' m a cop !
i said get your hand away !
calm down , buddy !
hand out of the pocket !
come on !
hurry up !
we' ve got to get them !
pull over !
what ?
they' re going to kill me !
let me in !
let me in !
the fucking door !
hurry !
hurry up !
where are we going ?
to the tv .
everybody needs help .
see if you can read that ?
gizmo hebert republican party headquarter " .
shit !
they' ve i . d . ' d the truck .
where' s david ?
what happened to you ?
we almost got caught .
don' t worry , i' il tell you later .
david !
i know you knew mona .
the guys who killed her are after us .
i need to borrow your car .
i really need your help out here .
please ?
david , come on .
do you have the keys ?
yes .
what does it look like ?
it' s out front .
it' s a volvo .
lf anybody comes around asking ...
i don' t know anything .
take these .
you might need a disguise .
being kicked out of le salle was the best that happened to me .
i wonder what makes people turn out the way they turn out .
i don' t know .
mona said she always liked her barbies from the gecko .
okay , so we tell them that you want to talk to the press .
don' t be afraid to tell them everything you know about mona ...
tidewater and the whole shooting match .
when your story gets out , that' s your protection .
are you all right ?
i can' t believe i' m depending on republicans to save me .
where' s gizmo ?
hey , darl .
darl misread our intentions .
we weren' t going to hurt you .
we wanted to give you a paid trip to cancun till after the election .
your little elves put a bullet through my truck .
that was a mistake .
a mistake ?
darl , what' s going on ?
hell if i know .
a truce .
more like a mexican stand off .
sister felicia confessed .
the anti casino folks ... planned to pick up a transsexual from a new orleans club .
sister felicia was in all this ?
partially .
she would tip gizmo ... when the governor showed up at tidewater .
gizmo picked mona up from the bar and invited to work a party .
drove her out with a premeditated purpose of taking a few photos ... of a transgender person socializing with the governor .
you killed mona ?
no .
i' il pass a polygraph .
but you drove her to tidewater .
okay .
but when our telephoto lens came out , freaks got offended ... we had an m. o. thought it was for money .
she was hysterical .
it got iffy , so we kicked her out of the car and george jetson .
you just left her ?
yeah , bubba .
we just left her .
then who killed mona ?
i can tell you with certainty ... that nobody in this room committed a capital crime .
both parties committed failures of judgment only .
now we should negotiate a binding and good faith settlement ... to keep this story in this room .
let the campaign decide the issues .
it' s what the people want .
lf you can' t tell me who killed mona , you have nothing for me .
there it is .
a fly in the ketchup .
somebody like mona or scarlet here might have a conscience .
this place stinks worse than tidewater .
let' s get out of here .
you' re the last person to be lecturing anybody on ethics .
you' re right , judge .
you' re always right .
darl !
darl , hold up .
you' re a parole violator who' s fired on police .
don' t be stupid .
that' s what i do best .
i won' t go to the press .
i don' t give a shit who wins the election .
i' il find out who killed mona .
lf anybody tries to stop me , i' il go kicking and screaming .
are you going to let him leave ?
i' m out of my jurisdiction .
you' re out of your job .
daril .
there' s a woman out here .
it' s about real justice for mona .
this is darl hardwick .
who am i speaking to ?
it' s me .
you got the phone booth out front of my place .
she made a call from your phone booth at 3 am .
did you see her ?
no , i didn' t .
ornelle says he was asleep .
he didn' t see anything .
something about this place really feels weird .
ls that it ?
o. 65 + o, 4o .
us$ 1 . o5 .
with tax , us$ 1 . 6o .
well , you got it down , don' t you , ornelle ?
i still haven' t been paid .
take that out of your judge .
you have a ladies room i could use ?
ladies room is closed .
it' s unclean .
well , do you have a man' s bathroom ?
i don' t believe in that , ma' am .
there' s a dixie burger up ahead .
she doesn' t want to go there , she wants to use the bathroom .
you' re not one of them ?
one of who ?
them who use the bathroom they ain' t supposed to use ?
where' s the key , ornelle ?
lost it .
who' s going to pay for this ?
what is it , darl ?
who do i bill for that ?
you can' t go in there !
that' s employees only !
darl ?
oh , my god !
you sat there and watched that girl through that peephole ?
lf this gun matches that bullet that killed her , it' s all over .
why ?
i want you to tell me .
fuck !
tell me you want me !
fuck me !
fuck me !
fuck you !
bitch , bitch ...
get out you freak !
freak !
oh , my god !
you tricked me , you bitch !
you tricked me , you whore !
stay away from me , you son of a bitch !
help me !
please !
you ain' t telling nobody on me !
i' il kill you !
i' il kill you !
bitch !
he never should have went in the ladies ' .
that' s not right .
that' s for ladies .
that' s all i' m going to say about it .
oh , my god .
i got it .
hello ?
hi .
how are things ?
fine .
that' s good .
look , you want mom ?
yeah .
tell her it' s important .
she might be needed here .
hold on .
hey , wait .
what ?
i just want to tell you i love you both .
hold on ...
i' il get mom .
mom !
ln a baton rouge press conference , the governor stated ... that yesterday' s loss is not the end of his political career .
and although i am conceding this race, l am not defeated .
not when there' s work left to do for the people of louisiana .
well , look how beautiful we are .
mona is smiling down on us .
i know that all of us have lost people .
and every time i think about her being face down that swamp ... it breaks my heart .
but we' re not going to talk about that today .
she was beautiful and she' d like to be remembered beautiful .
and she' d be so happy that all of you are here .
thank you so much .
i was hoping you' d come .
i' m giving things away .
i didn' t want to go through it alone .
i knew who you were before going to your office .
david told me you were brothers , and that you were a real dick .
we both thought it best that i not tell you we knew each other .
cause you might hold it against us .
i probably would have .
i' m sorry for lying about it .
i think i' m going to thank somebody for a car .
it' s about time .
are you going to be here ?
yeah , i' il be right here .
all right .
