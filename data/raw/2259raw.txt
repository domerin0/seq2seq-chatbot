good to see you , sir .
i was really happy to see you in the stands tonight .
i have to tell you , sir , i haven' t made up my mind yet .
as i' ve told you , it' s time for me to step down .
last few years have been really tough .
well , losing' s hard , sir .
this isn' t about losing games , kenny .
i can' t get them to show up for school , for practice .
i can' t get parents involved , and i' m done chasing kids in the streets and pulling them into the gym .
yeah , it' s a tough job .
richmond is a tough little city .
when i saw you here tonight , i thought , " i got him .
he' s in .
well , actually , i was here for another reason .
my son plays for st. francis .

don' t even discuss it again .
i can' t quite do that .
coach officially offered me the job tonight .
the clock' s ticking .
and when you say " offering job , " there' s usually money involved .
yeah , there might be a thousand bucks in it for me .
for five months of work ?
oh , well , you can' t say no to that .
and the team , it' s so bad .
those boys , they' re so angry and undisciplined .
and besides , you know , you don' t have the time .
you' re trying to open up a second store .

you still gonna come to my games ?
i' il probably miss most of your games , damien .
i' m sorry .

dad , you' ve always been my coach .
this is a great school , damien .

the state only requires that they have a 2 . 0 average to play .
now , you got in here they need a 2 . 3 .
if you have a 2 . 0 , you have to score at least 1050 on the sat to be eligible for an athletic scholarship .
if you have a 2 . 3 , you only need 950 .
now , 2 . 3 is just a c plus .
it shouldn' t be that hard to maintain a c plus .
these boys are student athletes .
student " comes first .
it says they gotta wear coat and ties on game days .
they don' t own ties !
you gonna supply the ties ?
there' s a goodwill and a salvation army store
less than two blocks from here .
they got a box full of ties for 50 cents apiece .
yo , man , what you trying to say , huh ?
oh , we too good to shop at the goodwill and salvation army , is that it ?
yeah , i ain' t that broke .
this is crazy !
a dress code and they have to sit in the front row in class ?
this is basketball , man !
and basketball is a privilege , ma' am .
if you want to play basketball on this team , these are the simple rules you have to follow if you want to enjoy that privilege .
now , if you decide to follow these simple rules ,
i need you and the boys to sign this contract .
they can bring the contracts to practice tomorrow .
if you come to practice .
i wanna thank you all for coming out and showing your support , and i hope i have your support the rest of the season .
good night .
get up and leave like that ?
look , i have a hard enough time getting my nephew to ...
how you gonna make them wear ties ?
i want the other coach back !
it' s one of your contracts , sir .
i' ve amended that contract .
you require your players to maintain a 2 . 3 grade point average .
i' ve committed to maintaining a 3 . 5 .
you require ten hours of community service , and i' ve committed to 50 .
any unexcused absences , any other disciplinary issues at school , you can nullify this agreement and send me to any school you want .
and how many days do i have to consider this offer ?
none .
the second page is a letter you need to sign that confirms my withdrawal from st. francis .
they know i' m leaving .

you withdrew from st. francis ?
i called richmond .
they expect me there in the morning .
you called richmond ?
you should have spoken to me about this .
it was a personal choice for me .
well , i can fix all that in the morning .
sir , please listen .
all i wanna do is play for you .
if i' m one of the top students at richmond ,
i mean one of the top in the whole school , and i have great sats ,
i can go to any college in the country .
i' m asking you to trust me .
you really wanna do this , huh ?
okay .
part of growing up is making your own decisions and living with the consequences .
3 . 7 .
and you will earn every minute of playing time .
open it , please .

now we have delilah .
she was my childhood sweetheart .
sir , was she hot ?
oh , yes , sir .

i remember once she tricked me into stealing brownies from christ the king first baptist church bake sale .
she smiled and got her way out of it , while i damn near had to wear a pillow on my butt for a month before i could sit down .
delilah , gentlemen .
she' s our trap defense .

well , i had my boys sign contracts requiring them to meet certain academic standards .
yes , i believe one of the faculty members mentioned that .
very interesting scare tactic .
well , in order for that to be successful ,
i need their teachers to fill out weekly progress reports so i' il know how the boys are doing in their classrooms .
okay .
well , i haven' t received anything from their teachers .
i don' t see how this ties in to your job as the basketball coach , mr. carter .
well , i took this job with the understanding i could do it my way .
and you can .
our next faculty meeting is in two weeks .
i' il remember to bring it up .

let me get some .
are you crazy ?
what is wrong with you ?
what' s wrong with all of you ?
since when is winning not enough ?
playing hard not enough ?
no , you have to humiliate your opponent .
taunt him after every score .
you won four games last season .
four .
what gives you the right to taint the game that i love with trash talk and taunting ?
what gives you the right to wear richmond on your chests and act like punks ?
coach , they were jawing too .
so ?
you can' t show some class ?
act like a champion ?
you owe me 500 push ups apiece .
on the line .
now .
damn .
oh , man , come on .
listen , shorty , i' m just gonna be real with you , okay ?
you' re my girl .
i get out on that court and everything is just getting crazy , all i gotta do is just think about you .
mr. lyle .
why aren' t you in ... ... geometry ?
i' m going there right now , sir .
sir , this is betty .
bella .
bella .
bella .
this is bella , sir .
go to class .
don' t forget that these projects are due at the end of this week .
so if any of you need extra time ...
excuse me , sir .
are you mr. gesek ?
yes .
i ... ... don' t see junior battle in this class .
junior battle is like a solar eclipse .
we rarely see him , but when we do , it' s always special .
thank you .
surprise arrival to the poll is richmond high at 19th .
top 20 , baby .
we' re 19th , dog .
the oilers have posted a perfect 9 0 mark , winning on the road against perennial powerhouses
xavier and baxter union .
junior , you should read the rest of this .
they blowing you up in this paper .
come on , man , read it .
man , you know he can' t read .
man , shut up .
shut up , maddux .
richmond center has been big as the oilers are ' boyed . " '
buoyed .
the word is " buoyed .
buoyed by junior battle' s 19 . 8 rebound a night numbers .
see , that' s my big nigga right there , son .
hey .
if you was any bigger , you' d be my bigger nigga .
sit down .
sit down !
nigger " is a derogatory term used to insult our ancestors .
see , if a white man used it , you' d be ready to fight .
your using it teaches him to use it .
you' re saying it' s cool .
well , it' s not cool .
and when you' re around me , i don' t wanna hear that shit .
we clear ?
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
mr. worm , what is it you want out of this basketball season ?
to win that state championship , sir .
well , who won the state basketball championship last season , lyle ?
hell if i know , sir .
does anybody know ?
okay .
what' s your father do for a living , mr. lyle ?
my father' s in jail , sir .
well , i' m sorry to hear that , sir .
but that doesn' t have to be your life .
i have four seniors on this team ,
junior , lyle , kenyon and worm .
all of whom i think can play basketball at the college level .
college .
that' s a viable option for all of you .
but you have to perform in the classroom to have that chance .
you have to have a vision .
tell me , how do you see yourselves ?
espn , baby .
that reminds me , mr. battle .
mr. gesek tells me he doesn' t see you in his classroom very often .
yeah , we cool , though , me and him .
mr. gesek is a big basketball fan .
well , as of now , you' re suspended .
oh , you can practice , but you can' t play until mr. gesek tells me you' re caught up in his class .
and that' s a shout out to the rest of you .
you signed a contract .
you made a commitment .
now , i have your schedules and i' il be getting reports from your teachers .
if you don' t perform in the classroom , you will not play .
what' s up with that ?
sit down , mr. battle .
all right , that' s 500 push ups .
man , this is bullshit !
we won those games , not you .
that' s 1, 000 push ups for mr. battle , clyde .
you wanna try for 2, 000 ?
young man , think about the choice you' re making if you walk out that door .
to the baseline .
all right .
how about laquisha , if it' s a girl .
laquisha ?
okay , yeah , the ghetto called and they want they name back .
girl , laquisha ?
be for real .
you might as well call the baby food stamp .
you' re stupid .
all right , i was thinking i could call her harmony .
i like harmony .
harmony , oh , that' s good .
i like that .
what did kenyon say ?
please , he want a boy .
figures .
speaking of michael jordan ...
yo , what' s wrong with a girl ?
yeah , dog , boys grow into men , and men ain' t worth the trouble .
don' t you have someplace to go ?
something to do ?
guess he wants me all to himself .
see you later .
don' t forget , i need your notes for history .
all right , i got you .
yeah .
see you later .
i bought us tickets to the dance .
why you telling these loudmouth girls about the baby ?
now everybody' s gonna know .
people are gonna know , kenyon .
it' s not people' s business , kyra .
why you jumping down my throat ?
what' s wrong with you ?
look , me and coach been talking , and he thinks i can play college ball .
all right , so ?
so how am i gonna do that and raise a baby ?
i don' t know .
i mean , i' m not saying it won' t be hard .
hard ?
it' s already hard .
the kid ain' t even here yet and i' m worried about how i' m gonna feed it , how i' m gonna pay for this and that .
everything .
i' m not ready .
so , what are you saying ?
you want out ?
is that what you' re saying ?
go ahead and say it .
look , if i wanted to be out , i would' ve been out by now , kyra .
that' s not it at all .
i love you .
i wanna be with you .
yeah , as long as it' s convenient .
i' m thinking about what' s best for us .
you' re not trying to think about what' s best for both of us , you' re thinking about what' s best for you .
you don' t want me to have this baby .
you wanna leave richmond .
you wanna go play college ball .
so guess what ?
we ain' t got to be ready enough for nothing , all right ?
i' m ready enough to do what i gotta do all by my damn self .
so you can take these and go to the dance yourself .
progress reports ?
you' re the basketball coach .
look , ma' am , we talked about this .
i don' t see what the problem is .
do you know what the api is , mr. carter ?
no , i don' t .
the academic performance index .
they judge schools on a scale of one to ten , ten being the best .
do you have any idea where richmond falls on that scale ?
no , ma' am , i have no idea .
we' re a one , mr. carter , and have been for the last seven years .
the state rewards schools for their performance .
so every year i have less money to pay faculty and staff .
look , ma' am ...
can i ask what it is you want ?
i want my boys to go to college .
college ?
mr. carter , richmond graduates 50 percent of its students , the higher percentage being girls .
now , in my very educated opinion , you have 15 players on your team , you' il be lucky to graduate five of them .
i' m sorry , ma' am , but i don' t agree with you .
look , these boys signed contracts .
maybe if you' d read one of them ...
your job is to win basketball games , mr. carter .
i suggest you start doing your job .
and your job is to educate these kids .
i suggest you start doing yours .
well ... ... we had another good week .
yeah , business is very good , kenny .
but i' m on my own .
you' re never here .
it gets crazy .
look , i appreciate everything you do .
and i promise you ...
we' re closed .
as soon as the season is over , i will be here for you .
mr. carter ?
i' m ...
junior battle' s mother .
yes , ma' am , i remember you .
willa .
willa battle .
how may i help you , ma' am ?
mr. carter , i got a phone call today from a coach at a junior college in sacramento .
now , they wanna see junior play this friday .
well , that' s great , ma' am , but junior broke some rules ...
and i agree with them .
i' m not here to argue with your rules .
i' m not .
almost two years ago now ,
junior' s older brother , anton , was ... ... killed , and it' s been confusing and hard for me and for junior .
after you lose a son ... ... every time the phone rings , your heart stops .
now , i' m not asking for special attention .
i agree he needs to get straight with his classes .
but the idea of junior college had never even occurred to my son .
now , i could move to the hercules school district , and he could play there .
but moving is not gonna solve ...
but i want him to play for you .
look , i' m not gonna stand here and say i know how it feels to lose a son , because i don' t .
and i do appreciate you putting your trust in me .
but i need to hear that from junior .
he in the car .
junior !
go on .
i' m sorry for what i said and did at practice , and i promise to get caught up with my classes , sir .
look me in the eye , sir .
everything inside me tells me if i take you back ,
i' d be making a mistake and you' il make a fool of me .
no , sir .
you owe me 1, 000 push ups and 1, 000 suicides before you can play .
i' il see you at practice tomorrow .
thank you , sir .
and you gonna do every last one of them .
quitting basketball like you pay rent .
i don' t know who you think you are .
the next time you make a decision , you better ask me first .
yo , junior , you did your thing tonight , man .
good looking out , yo .
yeah , good shot , junior .
yeah , no doubt .
gentlemen , listen up .
i just received a call from the director of the bayhill holiday tournament .
you have been invited .
yeah !
yeah , baby !
now , i have more good news .
i spoke to principal garrison today .
she informs me that your teachers will have your academic progress reports prepared by the end of holiday break .
sir , our grades are tight , yo .
yo , not only are our grades all right , coach ,
but we undefeated , homeboy .
yeah !
<i>we undefeated we undefeated</ i>

whatever .
you shouldn' t be here .
if you' re serious about this , you need to check this bullshit .
because if not ...
if not , what , kenyon ?
you wanna hold my hand through an abortion ?
is that what you want ?
i don' t know what i want .
you so damn sure you wanna have this baby , why don' t you tell me how it' s gonna be .
everything' s great , right ?
your cousin is 19 with two kids already , kyra .
it' s great ?
it was great when we was getting down .
you ain' t having no second thoughts about that .
you loved me when it came to that .
look , kyra , i can' t tell you what to do , but i look around and i see exactly how i don' t wanna live .
paycheck to paycheck ?
dead end job ?
you make it seem like everything' s gonna be all good ,
like everything' s so wonderful .
you don' t care about me .
you just wanna go to college , play ball and forget about me .
kyra , that' s not even how it is .
i don' t care what you say .
i' m having this baby .
and then what ?
you got everything figured out , right ?
so tell me what comes next .
