3 years have past
since noriko and i escaped from that island .
many students died from the br act , and noone could stop mine and noriko' s fight .
the world is now in the age of terrorism .
the anti br act organization ' wild seven ' leader nanahara shuya is wanted for his acts .
the adults started a new game , for ' justice ' .
' new century terrorist counter measure alternative ' a. k. a brii
the sign has been triggered .
we will never forget the adults who made us kill each other .
let us stand , and fight together .
we are declaring war to all adults .

battle royale ii
requiem
3 years ago , my father , who was a teacher , was shot by his own student .
the picture my father finished had a drawing of a girl .
when i found out that it wasnt me ,
i could never face school again
now , i' ve decided to join the game ,
to confront my feelings about him
wanted for murder and accessory nanahara shuya , nakagawa noriko
brii bright , cheerful , fun
thank you for registering
and so i enrolled at shikanotoride middle school , a ragtag collection of losers and delinquents from across japan .
we' d all been written off by adults
buncha jocks
none of us had any future .
for me , the only thing that felt real was my pain
shit !
friends shintaro
you too , taku
not me
why not ?
sign it , you graduated
nothing' s finished yet
hey , hey !
shintaro !
hey !
what the hell !
to you , the 10 million fans of the br act .
look !
the bus has just arrived under extreme tight security .
this time , class b in 9th grade at shikanotoride middle school has been chosen .
look !
you can see the students !
go in closer !
go in closer !
get a good look folks .
this is a specially selected bunch of losers .
they' re the first students to play under the revised br rules !
as the whole world watches , what battles can we expect this time ?
thanks to our sponsors , their getting combat uniforms and watches .
imagine the stirring sight of 42 youthful ,
passionate deaths !
be seated !
teacher !
teacher !
teacher !
what the hell !
all yours , sir
merry christmas !
i' m takeuchi riki , in charge of your class
by the way , you guys do understand what' s happening ?
we' re clueless
you' ve gotta explain
this necklace hurts , teacher
japan ,
china ,
north korea ...
what' s that shit !
load of crap
let' s split
time to go
move !
out of the way
cuba ,
congo ,
peru ,
laos ,
vietnam ,
cambodia ,
grenada ,
libya ,
el salvador ,
nicaragua ,
panama , iraq , somalia ,
bosnia , sudan ,
yugoslavia , and ...
afghanistan
what do they all have in common ?
in the past 60 years , america has bombed every one of them
some 8 million dead among 22 nations
equality ?
that' s a lie
there' s no such thing as equality
it' s been one year now , since that disastrous act of terrorism last christmas
the terrorists who destroyed so many lives in an instant have barricaded themselves on an island
as he claimed responsibility for the terrorism their leader , nanahara shuya said
we declare war against all adults
go right ahead
by the way , in this county , you' re not an adult until you' re 20
anyone else is a child !
have you ever considered just how much money it takes to raise a child to adulthood !
huh !
what the ... the hell ?
save your weapons for later
somewhere between 30 and 40 million yen
that' s what your lives are worth right now
this impoverished country can no longer afford to support expensive worthless kids like you !
so the adults discussed it with the bigwigs
and decided to reject his decleration of war
sorry to have kept you waiting
br il !!
today you guys go to war
not so fast
brii is a whole new war game , based on the br act , with simple rules
track down and kill the evil leader , nanahara shuya and you win
you' ve got 72 hours
got that ?
no way !
see that white line on the floor ?
there are only two sides in life , the winners and the losers .
anyone who crosses that line ... has the guts to be the winner .
players to the right and ... the unfortunate losers to the left .
this is the line that divides good from evil .
it' s black or white .
there' s nothing in between .
i' il call your names in order .

get to your fucking point
ever seen this weapon ?
the ak47 , automat kalashnikioff
the international symbol of guerilla resistance
3 years ago i survived a former game , with another girl
after we went back to the normal world .
we went to a world where there was 20 years of war .
there was inflation and millions of refugees .
other countries tried to ignore
it as if it was already over .
but even under those hellish conditions their smiles were always those of pride
the open smiles of the children
so what ?
what the hell' s that got to do with us ?
what are you fighting for now ?
listen , kill me and the game' s over
but would your struggle end ?
can you forget all this and resume your old lives ?
they all died because of you !
we' il keep on fighting
we' il keep on fighting , even if we have to fight every last adult in the world
until the day that we can smile the open smile of the children we once saw
shuya , special forces , approaching our perimeter
here we go
back to our hideout
all of us here either survived a game or lost family
we' re not your enemies
we' re going
you , too
wait , jin
hey !
taku !
you kids stay back !
hide !
i didn' t have a clue what the hell your point was
how does it feel ?
to murder others
to survive alone ?
how does it feel ?
you aim a gun , you shoot it
this is what it takes to survive
yuuma !
yuuma !
yuuma !
yuuma !
yuuma !
down !
hq !
this is mamiya the students have gone over to the terrorists
we' re being slaughtered !
send reinforcements
sir !
sir ?
shit !
you' re just a bunch of brats !
shit , you got me !
i have ... a family too ...
christmas the rain kept falling
nozomi ...
hang on nozomi
with only the moans of the dying echoing heavily in our minds
nozomi !
sagaisawa !
sagaisawa
i' m sorry sasaisgawa
i ...
i ...
survive ...
all of you , survive ...
don' t forget ... about me
don' t for ... get ...
nozomi !
sagaisawa !
girls # 6 sagaisawa nozomi dead 10 to go
we lost another friend
now what are we supposed to do ?
answer me !
there is no answer .
you' ve got to search for one
taku !
we never had anywhere we could go
i knew that all along
or any place to go home to !
this is war , right ?
you' re all fighting for your lives
but die , and you' re just one more candle
even those poor little kids
you' re all the same .
you' re no better than the adults
how i wish this war would end
i keep on asking myself
how can i answer all those who have died
i don' t know
but inevitably , we all grow up to be adults
the best we survivors can do ,
is to keep remembering the ones who died
always and forever , even after we grow up
hello ?
hello ...
hello
what are you doing ?
i told you to knock
you stink .
don' t come in here
listen , today' s your birthday , right ?
thought you and mum and i could go out
you' re the worst
what ?
my birthday was yesterday
it' s today ?
it was yesterday
just get out
listen shiori
still got more to say .
what ?
i guess i should do this right ?
what an idiot
the thing people fear most , isn' t death , it' s being forgotten
we' re all here , now .
we all wanted someone to know .
you' il be just fine
you don' t keep losing you' re temper because you' re sick
if you make friends at this school , you' il get better
because all the kids here are just like you
i promise i' il come and get you
please , let' s go
one day , they' il all disappear
family , friends ...
but i' il always be by your side
i can' t do anything for you , but i' il be there for you
i promise ...
nobu ,
kawada , all you guys
i' m not wrong , am i ?
i' m fighting along ... with the best of you , right ?
you ok ?
mimura !
run !
shit !
blowing a couple of guys away won' t change a thing in this country
but i don' t know any other way
survive this !
and don' t look back !
and then , finally the rain let up
how much blood has been shed ?
how many tears spilled ?
all of our friends who fought beside us are dead , killed in the last 3 years
but even as justice can never be vanquished we terrorists will never vanish , however evil they deem us
because we know
that a handful of adults , a handful of nations selfishly define the nature of peace and freedom in this world
but our world is so much more complex than that
this world has 6 billion people living their own lives in 6 billion different ways ,
6 billion kinds of peace , 6 billion kinds of freedom
6 billion kinds of war and evil
no one has achieved peace without fighting for it
behind every peace , there' s a river of blood , sweat and tears
it' s going live to global host computers worldwide
but if we avert our eyes from that history and abandon it , then peace might as well be dog shit
dog shit , huh ?
japan , china ,
north korea ,
guatemala , indonesia ,
cuba , congo ,
peru , laos ,
vietnam , cambodia ,
grenada , libya ,
el salvador ,
nicaragua ,
panama ,
iraq ,
somalia ,
bosnia , sudan ,
yugoslavia ,
afghanistan .
you may be lonely , but it' s time to stop being afraid
to all the abandoned children of earth
let' s rise up together and fight together
we' re throwing away the old rules taking off to a world far , far away
tonight , i send this message to all the adults who stole
our freedom and pinned us down
merry christmas
nanahara shuya , wild seven
evacuate !
are you ok ?
look after the baby , the children
who fired the missiles !
we' re still investigating
sir , a call for you
it' s ... the prime minister
put him through
yes , sir
hey , teacher , what a mess , huh ?
who do you think fired those missiles ?
we finally pissed that country off
i got a call from their president they' re going to attack in 12 hours
what the hell' s going on with your class ?
what are you waiting for !
so what if a dozen kids die , it doesn' t matter
fire a missile and blow up the whole damned island
you really mean that ?
you suprise me
i thought you were a full fledged adult who' d crossed the line a long time ago
you do understand
there are only two sides , the winners or the losers
which side are you on ?
fight with that country for justice and freedom
cut the crap , you murderer !
what ?
half a century ago , that country compared ours to a 12 year old
how old does that make that country now !
if any country pisses it off , it just bombs them
you call that adult behavoir !
listen , the whole world' s rallied behind that country
and who made that choice ?
so what the hell are you doing there ?
i see .
too bad .
i had hopes for you
exercising my full power as prime minister , i call upon the armed forces
prepare for battle immediately .
before that country launches its missiles
i want every last terrorist and nanahara shuya
dead
attention !
salute !
taku !

we have a future , as long as we desire to have one .
