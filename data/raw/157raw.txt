don' t get cute with me , son .
no , sir , i don' t mean to be disrespectful .
i justthinkthat well , l
it is reckless and irresponsible ... if you' re just doing it to be a show off .

he ... he told me he' d been assigned .
he was always trying to protect me .
butyou know what ?
i look at myself in the mirror in this uniform ... and i still don' t know who i am .

the hawaiians called this harbor waimomi .
it means " water of pearls .
it' s so beautiful .
my dadtookme up a couple oftimes .
just don' t do what he did .
what do you call it when youflip over ?
danny : a barrelroll ?
yeah .
i won' t .
aah !
oh !
ha ha ha ha !
oh , god .

man : hey !
thatplane was supposed to be backhere anhourago !
quick , hide in the parachute hangar .
my heart is pounding .
danny , last night ...
no, that' s terrible .
danny, we need to talk aboutthis .
sir .
evelyn !
danny .
hey .
hi .
hi .
i didn' t sleep a wink last night .
i had to see you .
last nightwas crazy , i know , but ...
i' m not sorry .
are you ?
i don' t know .
danny , i had a wonderful time last night .
i
it' s just all toofast .
listen , evelyn , i was just down atthe beach this morning ... and i watched the sun rise ... and i knew that everything was gonna be different .
thatthis was the start of something new .
in this place , in this moment .
and i don' t care what anybody else says, you know ?
how can i notfeel this way ?
i kinda like you .
oh, you do ?
you have yourtie on crooked .
everything' s gonna be all right , ok ?
everything' s gonna be all right .
do you have any airtours going through the valley of oahu ?
you do ?
maleradlohost : aloha .
this is kgmb inhonolulu ... on anotherbeautiful fall dayhere inparadise .
we have enough information .
we are returninghome .
evelyn : do you everwonder ... ifthis war' s gonna catch up with us ?
nota whole lot .
every momentwe' re nottogether , you' re upthere trainingfor it .
yeah, well , i' m training for moments like these ...
' cause i have no idea ... how i' m gonna getthis car out of the sand .
evelyn , can you please come out of the bathroom ?
you' ve been therefor an hour .
evelyn !
what are you trying to do , look like me ?
barbara : are you ok ?
yeah .
what' s the matter ?
no, you
d' oy .
they call itthe vacant sea .
none of the major sea lanes go through it ... and you can bury the entire land mass of asia there ... andnobody wouldknow .
from there , they could attack anywhere .
our last signals intercept ... indicate thatthe japanese taskforce is heading south ... towards the philippines orsoutheastasia .
but captain thurman of naval lntelligence here ... has his own theory aboutthe missing ships .
sir , i believe they' il try to hit us ... where it' il hurt us the most pearl harbor .
it' s over4, 000 nautical miles from japan to pearl .
that' s alongdistance to steam anavy , captain .
yourtheory is based on what ?
well , it' s what i would do .
that' s notexactly hardevidence , captain thurman .
well, admiral , if i had hard evidence ... we' d already be atwar .
sir, we can read their diplomatic codes ... fasterthan they can type them .
but captain thurman' s cryptology team ... is still trying to crackthe naval codes .
the intercepts have missing words and garbled lines ... so to explain the decrypts , we have to try to interpret ... whatwe think they' re trying to do .
interpret ?
you mean guess .
they use their informed intuition , sir .
we guess .
it' s like playing chess in the dark .
any rumor, troop movement , ship movement ... spine tingle , goose bump , we pay attention to it .
when i was in the asiatic fleet ... the locals used to try to get outside of a problem ... to try to see the inside .
well, lsee astrike onpearl .
it' s the worstthing that could happen .
a blow to pearl would devastate ... the pacific fleet' s ability to make war .
so , sir, you would have us mobilize the entirefleet ... atthe cost of millions of dollars ... based on this spine tingling feeling of yours ?
no , sir .
my job is to gather and interpret material .
makingdifficult decisions ... based on incomplete information ... from my limited decoding ability ... is yourjob , sir .
then breakthe damn naval code , captain ... so i can make a better decision .
aye , sir .
we are trying .
i wonder if we shouldn' t put the pacific fleet onfull alert .
ln case the optimism ... ofthe " honoluluadvertiser " proves unfounded, gentlemen ... what are general short and the army ... going to do about protecting my ships ?
within a ten mile radius of your harbor ... we have fighterplanes here at wheeler ... bombers athickam , and a trainingstrip athaleiwa .
we' ve recently established a radar station here ... thatcan detectplanes 125miles out .
which is a month old, admiral , and untested .
i' ve seen these new radar screens , major .
there' s no way of telling whetherthey' re ours, theirs ... or aflock of damn birds .
llstener : l' m intercepting a callfrom tokyo ... to somewhere close bypearl .
there' s a callfrom tokyo .
they say they don' t know you .
hello ?
hai .
it' s alocaldentist .
he cansee pearlharbor from his office .
are there many sailors around ?
uh , the dentist says thatthe flatships ... are not in port .
they' re talkingabout the weather .
he doesn' tseem to know who he' s talkingto .
hello ?
hello ?
moshi moshi .
hello ?
thatwas a strange call .
admiral , may i speakto you in private ?
why wouldaspy use aphone ?
they know we tap all international lines .
our listenersfeel it' s probably not code talk .
it sounds like someone in japan is sneaking around ... asking a local citizen the location of our carriers .
well, that makes mefeel all warm inside .
getthe fbi on it immediately .
have wefound the goddamn japanese fleetyet ?
no, admiral .
the bases are looking all overthe pacific .
so the entirefleet could be rounding diamond head ... and we wouldn' t know a thing about it .
get on it .
rafe : l' m alive .
this is the first lcouldgetwordout .
jepense gu' ilestmort !
ilestencore en vie .
i told you i' d come back .

and herface was the lastthing thatwentthrough my mind ... so don' t stand there and tell me to act like it' s all right !
yeah , rafe, well , i stayed .
i stayed , and you made sure of that ... and some things changed .
and i hope you can get used to that .
oh , i have to get used to it ?
