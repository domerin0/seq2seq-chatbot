emergency .
which serice do you require , please ?
help ...
behind me is brabourne school , ... .. where news is just in that the missing teenagers have been found after 18 days .
now the waiting is finally over .
the four teenagers attend brabourne school , ... .. where fees are in excess of $30, 000 a year .
unconfirmed reports say they have been taken to a local hospital , ... .. where their families have been anxiously waiting .
michael steel , son of rock guitarist stevie steel , was one of the missing .
liz .
liz !
see you inside .
he' s going to kill us !
no !
liz ...
no !
stop !
hi .
i' m dr horwood .
i' m here to help you .
thanks .
don' t put me on prozac or lithium .
i' m not crazy .
it' s just my mum , she won' t listen .
i' il listen .
do i have to talk about it today ?
you make it sound so terrible .
if you trust me and you work with me , ... .. l really think i can help you feel better .
so we do this at your speed , yeah ?
we can stop at any time .
i won' t lie to you : this is going to be difficult , ... .. but i know that you' re brave enough to get through it .
let' s try a breathing exercise .
it might seem really ... stupid , but let' s just give it a bash , ok ?
take a nice deep breath .
feel your lungs fill up with air .
good .
drop your shoulders .
and when you exhale , tell all the muscles in your body to relax .
and whenever you feel ready , just start to speak .
ok ?
this is how it works at brabourne .
if you want to exist , you have to be pretty .
you have to be thin .
everyone else is wallpaper .
foryears i was a nobody .
i watched the world from the edges and learned not to dream .
oh , is he ?
my best friend , martin , didn' t care .
take everything you can from them .
he said that theirgreed makes them easy to control .
it made him powerful .
but then the world changed .
get ready , girls .
mike steel is single again .
oh , my god !
mike steel .
american .
the son ofa rock star .
the missing part ofmy soul .
get up !
please get up .
please , please be ok .
get up .
sorry , mate .
i see why this lot need to wear body armour .
it' s a homoerotic thing .
all that aggression out here , ... .. then all that steam and soap in the showers .
that' s disgusting .
right , you two !
off !
maybe geoff will be mike' s new bride .
for your information , martin , he' s dating a supermodel called amber .
for yours , he' s not .
you lie .
don' t you live here ?
haven' t you noticed that suddenly everyone' s a blonde with cherry lip gloss ?
there' s been an invasion of amber clones .
it' s passed you by , thank god .
you' re the last woman with a brain in brabourne .
he' s single ?
half a brain .
yes .
oh , not you , too , liz .
please don' t lose it .
i didn' t know .
but he' s just a guy like me .
you wouldn' t think he was so perfect if you knew him .
he shits and farts like the rest of us .
he' s just a fuck of a lot less interesting !
i can' t help it .
it' s an egg thing .
when i look at mike , i see the face of an angel ... .. and the soul of a poet .
i need him .
no , no , no .
no , you love me .
it' s a martin taylor fact .
has there been a day in the last five years that we haven' t talked ?
but you' re more like a gay friend than a boyfriend .
but i' m not gay !
yeah , right
it' s the end of term , i' ve got some grateful exes to call ... .. and most importantly , i am out of here .
hello there is the small matter of the geography field trip .

well , she saw martin taylor .
you know what i want show me the money
frankie ?
frankie ?

my coursework doesn' t write itself , you know .
what is it ?
intensive conditioner .
it should have you sorted in 20 minutes .
what did you use ?
peroxide .
where from ?
the lab .
oh , lizzie .
i just thought if i was a blonde like amber , then ...
i don' t mean to be rude , but i don' t think doing stuff to yourself ... .. will make any difference to mike .
no , ...
i know .
oh , don' t worry about it .
trust me , he' s not that wonderful .
frankie ?
thanks .
i know you don' t have to be nice to me .
don' t worry about it .
my life has no meaning .

i love him and he doesn' t even know i exist .
i hate seeing you like this .
hey , i can cheer you up .

you' ve never had the pain .
god , i feel like i' m dying .

welcome to my office .
now , this is a need to know operation .
can you do it or not ?
no field trip , ... .. no parents , no paparazzi ?
i can do anything .
and , er ... .. l' m adding one to your number .
a kindred spirit .
martin knew that the school and ourparents always believed each other .
he called it the unholy alliance .
if ourparents thought we were in wales and the school thought we were at home , ... .. they' d never question it .
baby

you seem cold , oh

ln love bye !

my friend was driving his girlfriend in his ferrari ...
who do you know with a ferrari ?
bob and sally .
you don' t know them .
bob and who ?
mike , don' t !
fuck off .
really , relax .
bob and sally went for a drive , but they ran out of petrol in the middle of nowhere .
so bob went to find some .
sally was left in the car .
she switched on the radio ... .. and they said there was like this crazy madman on the loose .
but she was really tired ...
man with a hook .
on the roof of the car .
with bob' s head on a stick .
on a hook !
no , this really happened !
oh , yeah , yeah , yeah , frankie
ok , i' ve got one for you .
make you cack your pants .
what ? !
shut up , man .
something happens to martin .
doesn' t come back for us .
told you .
that' s sick .
possible .
don' t be stupid .
geoff , you shouldn' t say that .
what if you make it happen ?
how can i make anything happen when i' m here with you ?
you' il jinx us .
how ?
it' s tempting fate !
oh , please how does that work ?
lizzie ?
i' m a scientist .
i don' t believe in fate .
mike ?
i' m a scientologist .
i' m with liz .
oh , yes !
fine !
but if anything happens to martin , it' s geoff' s fault , ok ?
if that' s what it takes to get you to shut up about it , fine .
fine .
fine .
is my story the best , or what ?
ole , ole ole ole !
liz .
bingham , bingham liz .
what happened on the third day ?
don' t you want to know what we did ?
martin was supposed to let you out , wasn' t he ?
liz ?
liz .
i don' t know !
what don' t you know ?
i don' t know what happened .
come on , you' re quite safe here .
deep breaths .
look at me .
it' s the third day .
you' re packed and ready to go .
what' s the time now ?
same as when you asked two minutes ago .
well , it can' t be the same time if two minutes have passed , can it ?
it' s 3 . 32 , then .
so where is he ?
the field trip' s supposed to be back in 30 minutes .
i have a driver waiting .
this is so ...
what if he' s been hit by a bus , is in a coma and can' t tell anyone where we are ?
oh , please .
oh , my god .
what if he' s dead ?
he' s not dead !
i' il call him .
what' s his number ?
they don' t work down here !
here , give me your phone .
let me try .
you get anything ?
no , nothing .
maybe give it a shot up by the door .
does it work ?
no , nothing .
you' ve jinxed us .
i knew you would .
this is a wind up .
no , this is your fault !
you never should have said those things !
hey !
you guys !
have you thought that maybe the traffic' s heavy ?
it' s cool , i' m not worried .
help !
help !
geoff !
open the door !
everyone just calm ...
he' s just trying to help !
what do you think i' m trying to do ?
please !
shut up and let me get on with it !
you' re stinking mad .
hey !
hey .
we' re nowhere closer !
hit it with the pipe , then .
i' il tell you what .
why don' t you have a go , darling ?
go on !
ok , so they know we never went to wales .
as far as they know , we have a three day head start , ... .. which means they could be covering a three day radius of the school .
that covers ... .. like , the whole world .
so what do we do ?
we' re being held to ransom until martin says so .
we can' t do anything .
don' t say that !
i mean , he could just be ill .
isn' t that right , lizzie ?
i don' t know .
why would he do this ?
we' re his friends !
are we ?
is he really your friend , frankie ?
he' s not mine .
think about it .
i don' t know a thing about him .
he has no morals , no ethics .
everything' s just a game to him .
oh , so this is a game ?
oh , that' s great !
that' s fucking wonderful
oh , my god , i paid for this .
yeah , but he' s careful .
nothing' s left to chance .
right now , we' re trapped because he wants us trapped .
why ?
well , i guess we' re gonna find out .
liz .
look at me .
he didn' t come back .
martin didn' t come back .
you' ve cracked it !
i knew you would .
i told the lads .
this fucking great cheer went up .
a bloody schoolboy , i said .
little lord bloody fauntleroy !
good job , doctor .
thanks , detective .
the hunt for the kidnapper of the brabourne teenagers ... .. took an unexpected turn today , ... .. as it was announced that police have arrested a pupil from the school .
the boy , who cannot be named for legal reasons , ... .. was located in the dominican republic , ... .. where it is believed he was on holiday with his family .
i' ve put together a rough character sketch based on the information we have .
locking the children in suggests a sociopathic personality .
he doesn' t think what he' s done is wrong .
he probably thinks he' s above the law .
right now he' s probably creating a very strong alibi .
so the longer he has to conjure up this fiction , the harder it' il be to crack .
if you want a confession , you' il have to act quickly .
so , ... .. when the police arrest martin , will they put him in a cell ?
i presume so .
good .
i hope they do .
let' s see how he likes it .
all right , let' s start .
er ... hang on .
ok , i' m ready .
can we talk ?
sure .
shall i come over there ?
ok .
can i get in ?
what' s up ?
can' t sleep ?
it ... it' s about martin .
i think he' s watching us .
i saw ... a shadow pass the slat .
it could be nothing , i ...
i could be wrong ... .. but i think it might have been him checking up on us .
it probably is him .
it' s so funny .
y' know , stevie sent me here to protect me from the nut jobs at home .
i think i know what martin' s doing .
go on .
martin wants me to see that ... .. it was stupid of me to like you when i don' t even know you .
he wants me to hate you .
we' re still down here because he was wrong .
he hates being wrong , ... .. so we' re stuck down here till he' s right .
hold on .
you knew this would happen even before we came down here ?
no , of course not .
but it' s the only explanation i can think of .
but what difference does it make ?
he likes you , doesn' t he ?
yeah .
since we were eleven .
one of those .
yeah .
but you ... .. like me ?
yeah .
sorry .
don' t worry about it .
but ... how does he know you don' t hate me ?
i mean ...
i don' t ...
how could he work that out from a split second at the door ?
i don' t know .
what is it ?
what ?
is that what i think it is ?
yeah .
are there more ?
whoa .
try that one over there .
which one ?
this one .
he' s covered the whole place .
jesus christ !
what' s going on ?
what is it ?
liz , it' s the middle of the night !
what ?
i' m really worried about her .
she needs a doctor .
that' s obvious i thought you were supposed to be smart .
i bet it' s that dirty toilet water that' s making her ill .
it' s not my fault !
yes , it is !
this is shit !
this is the worst time i' ve ever had !
i hope i never see you again .
it' s not that bad !
no !
things are very bad !
i mean , am i the only one who can smell the toilet ?
who left the monster log that we can' t fucking flush ?
we' re fucked , and it' s all your fucking fault !
why me ?
because he' s your best friend !
yeah !
i should' ve never came down here .
as soon as i saw you , ... .. you fucking geeky little fucking bitch , ... .. l should' ve turned the other fucking way !
just stay the fuck away from me , you fucking loser !
you' re not so great yourself , you know .
you' re full of shit !
what are you , anyway ?
you' re just a face ... and hair !
oh , shut up , you ... .. fuckin ' ... .. comebag !
we waited and waited , and nothing happened .
but it worked .
the next morning mike woke me up and the door was open .
we were so happy .
we were out .
we all grabbed each other andjust stood in the light .
it was over .
we' d beaten him .
we' d won .
what martin didn' t realise was that i' d even won mike .
we ran up as quickly as we could .
mike gave me a great big hug and he said " you saved us .
" you saved us all .
you saved us all .
here we are .
right .
well done .
i told you you' d get through it .
how do you feel ?
lighter .
last night i even closed the door all the way and i didn' t panic .
excellent .
you' ve made a lot of progress .
we' ve still got a lot of work to do .
oh ?
yeah , but you' il get there .
it' s ... it' s really good .
i' il see you later .
ok ?
bye .
bye .
yeah , tom here .
tom , it' s philippa .
what can i do foryou ?
listen , she thinks she spent the last week in fucking disneyland !
oh , yeah ?
i' m sorry .
i didn' t see it coming .
doesn' t matter , i' il get a confession out ofmartin , no problem .
i mean , how delusional can she be ?
so i suppose you' ve got fingerprints ?
dna ?
cctv footage of me creeping around or a stack of witnesses with 20/ 20
do you even have a motive ?
a bloody good reason why i should lock up a bunch of socialites ... .. and throw away the key , however tempting that might be ?
what did you do on the last day of term ?
is she deaf ?
is she thick ?
i mean , can they really keep asking the same question hour after hour ?
please .
just so we' re clear .
i got up at 7am as usual .
i cleaned my teeth and had a shit .
i was down at breakfast by 7 . 20am , as usual .
the matron ticked me off the list , ... .. l had two slices of cold toast with warm butter and sweet tea as usual .
i returned to my study and carried my bags to the school minibus at 8am ... .. and was sat on the minibus by 8 . 05 .
i sat beside the driver because i wanted to sit on my own .
we left for the station at 8 . 30am and arrived at a not unreasonable 8 . 45am .
i bought a telegraph and a kit kat ... .. and then caught my train promptly at 9 . 05 from platform two .
i was alone until charing cross , where i was met by my mother , ... .. who parked the car in the wrong area and got a ticket as usual .
martin .
we know why you did it , how you did it , the whole fucking lot .
elizabeth has told us everything .
hey ?
well , i knew she was fucked in the head , but i didn' t realise she was this vicious .
well , you ... you know liz hates me .
you do know that , don' t you ?
thanks for taking me home .
i can' t wait to get into my own bed .
you' il feel better once you get back into your old routine .
now , if you need anything , day or night , just call me , all right ?
you can go back any time you want .
i have to get back to the real world .
you said so yourself .
you really don' t know anything , do you ?
liz and frankie are best friends !
they' re thick as thieves !
you' re sure ?
they' re practically the same person !
boring , vain , shallow enough to paddle in .
but liz is the really nasty one .
do you have a pen ?
this is how it is at brabourne .
to exist , you eitherhave to be a bitch ora complete slut .
what is it ?
amber dumped mike half an hour ago .
oh , fuck .
come on .
it' s the big chance you' ve been waiting for !
oh , my god , i' m going to be sick .
move quick , girl , or you' il be auditioning with every peekaboo slut from london up .
i don' t just want him .
i really want him , frankie .
i' ve got a plan .
let' s hear it .
we go to the beach again like last year .
but this time we camp out .
it' il be perfect .
the sea air , the stars ...
i hate beaches .
all that sand up your crack and nowhere to pee apart from the ocean .
and it dries out the complexion .
i' il look 40 after ten minutes and you want me to go for a week ?
remember that place we found and said it' d be great for a party ?
the s& m dungeon martin tried to take you to ?
precisely .
what if we did that ?
i could get mike pretty much on his own for a few days ... .. and we could even ask geoff ... for you .
the four of us ?
yeah .
a private party , the end of term .
me , you , mike and geoff .
oi , oi , frankie !
.. up his arse with a rampant penis
wahey !
dangerous place for a lady .
if you say so .
whooo !
out .
neil , out !
she' s not here for you .
see you , geoff .
couldn' t have come at a better time .
i' m ready if you are .
how would you like to go to the best private party of your life ?
are you going ?
it' s my party .
how private ?
you , me , ... .. mike and liz .
mike never mentioned it .
that' s cos you' re inviting him .
i don' t know if i could do that .
it' s for three days .
absolutely extracurricular .
your parents don' t know and the school doesn' t know .
what we do would be our own business .
but if you' re too pussy , then i' il ask someone else .
i never said i wasn' t interested .
in or out ?
in .
but you have to bring mike .
i' il have a word with his highness .
anything else ?
put your knob away .
go .
did you do it ?
yeah .
done .
it will be great .
oh , please
man , i' m telling you , this is different .
this is ten out of ten .
frankie and liz .
real ten out of ten
so you' re going home to an empty house and fuck the maid again ?
you haven' t seen the maid .
plus ... .. amber won' t know where you are .
won' t be able to find you .
she' il assume you' re having a more exciting time with more famous people .
it' il drive her nuts .
all right .
i' m in .
when you' re convinced ofyoursuperiority , ... .. you don' t need help from mere mortals like me .
you can fuck things up all byyourself .
so there you have it .
i thank you .
what time did you lock them in the hole ?
because i know you did it .
how dare you be this wrong and this fucking pig headed !
how dare you put my mother through this !
how do you know it was me ?
i' m dying to know !
come on !
one of them is lying .
i have to talk to her .
she can tell me what i need to know .
i understand .
but if you start demanding things , ... .. she could go back to that stony silence bullshit .
that' s a risk i have to take .
i' ve nothing on martin .
in 12 hours , he walks .
tom , if you say one word to her , i will fucking kill you !
just let me go .
i' il get the answers .
he' s going to get away with it , isn' t he ?
no .
you mustn' t think like that .
did he ever keep a diary or journal , or anything like that ?
i don' t think so .
did he have a secret hiding place ?
no , i don' t know .
why ?
what' s wrong ?
you' re not going to let him out , are you ?
i' m afraid that' s not my decision .
he' s going to come after me !
he won' t , liz .
you' re perfectly safe .
is he out now ?
no , but he will be in a couple of hours .
hours ? !
that' s why i really need you to remember .
you said i' d be safe .
you are safe .
i trusted you !
i thought we were friends !
i told you everything !
you' ve been pretending the whole time because you' re paid to !
that' s not true .
leave me alone !
i can help you .
nice one .
you don' t want to be found , do you ?
shave yourhead )
sweeties !
geoff , pass it up !
give it here !
you want it , you got it , baby !
we' re watching you )
we' re watching you

and why would there be sex ?
i mean , what have you done for me ?
no , i don' t think so .

what did she do ?
oh , go on , give us a look , franks .
what did she do ?
nothing .
oh , come on , do it again !
forget it , it' s supposed to be a party .
it' s a shit party , but it' s a party nonetheless .
you always get to see everything .
why' s it always you ?
i never get to see the good bits .
can' t we have the light on ?
no !
i can' t sleep if it' s light .
well , it' s too dark to sleep !
how can it be ?
shut your eyes .
well , i can' t tell when my eyes are open or closed , it' s so fucking dark !
oh , shit !
shh !
it' s only me .
never fear , geoff' s here .
what ?
can we get some sleep , please !
will you shut up !
what are you doing ?
mm ...
turn the light off .
she must have spent days picking the lock , but she did it .
she beat him and i' il beat him too .
little shit ofa schoolboy .
his website , " disciples of chaos , " ... .. is anarchist bullshit about disrupting stock exchanges , air traffic control , ... .. the web itself .
i' m gonna nail him .
i don' t think he' s angry enough to have done it .
hi .
thanks for meeting me .
no problem .
shall we go straight there ?
sure .
it' s not far , it' s just up the hill .
i' m not great with small spaces .
neither am l .
i can' t stand them .
but that will be the least of your worries when you get down there .
what were they doing here ?
trying to have a good time .
they had plenty of booze , they' d wired up some party lights .
the prime suspect has been released without charge .
the police have yet to make any formal statement ... .. and it is understood that investigations are proceeding satisfactorily .
the families have requested that the press res ...
god .
you can' t go !
the trip doesn' t get back for two days !
mate , you said you' d do this .
fuck the trip .
ok , yeah , fuck things up for the rest of us .
do something !
get him to stay !
i don' t know what to do !
i won' t tell anyone , ok ?
please don' t go .
you' il ruin everything .
look , i' m not gonna stay down here and listen to you fuck each other' s brains out .
i' m trying .
i' m leaving too !
not you as well
i' m not playing gooseberry .
i' m not staying down here .
are you going straight home ?
we could stop by the station and get a pizza .
i' m starving .
no .
thanks , though .
c' mon , trains go to london all the time .
yeah , no .
i ...
i know .
i' m gonna go by amber' s , see if we can patch things up .
things have been awful .
amber ?
but she humiliated you .
how the fuck would you know anything about that ?
enjoy yourselves .
i' m outta here .
hey , mikey ?
your weed , mate .
mate , you said you' d do this .
you said it' d be fun .

you' il have a great weekend .

please .
you' re gonna get laid .

you' re gonna have a great time .
you' il be here completely by yourselves .

i hate him .
what' s up , liz ?
something' s wrong !
i can' t open the door !
can you move out of the way ?
watch this .
fuck !
it won' t open .
well , push it , you twat .
the handle' s stuck .
you are such a donkey , mate .
oi , liz !
down .
let me sort it out .
you are such a cretin .
look , i' m not fucking retarded , ok ?
the fucking door won' t open !
get out of the way !
who was the last one down ?
it was geoff .
how fucking hard did you slam it ?
it wasn' t me , it was liz !
it' s a heavy door !
it slammed itself .
doors don' t just slam themselves locked .
hello !
sorry !
i didn' t know we' d get stuck , did l ?
this is bullshit !
you' re sorry ? !
that' s just fucking great
what do we do ?
do we just fucking rot ?
i guess ... we just wait to be found .
in two days , my parents are going to be up there waiting for me .
if i' m not there , they' il know i told a pack of lies and i' il be up to my arse in shit !
good point .
my parents' il go berserk !
good fucking job , asshole !
how long before we' re found ?
i don' t know !
shit !
i am in so much trouble !
perfect
help !
anyone !

somebody try the glass .
we have to do something that might open the fucking door !
well , what' il we fucking do ?
fucking bitch !
you fucking bitch !
you all right ?
why don' t we sit down ?
thanks .
it' s been a nightmare for forensics .
they can barely lift a usable print .
it' il take us six months to sift through all the hair and fibre we lifted .
what about the listening devices ?
the kids probably mistook the small air vents for microphones .
lack of food and water would have made them confused and paranoid .
so do you have anything to tie martin taylor to the scene ?
not yet .
but he will have left something somewhere .
and we' il find it .
right .
thanks .
open the door !
you bitch !
open the door !
liz !
liz !
liz !
sorry !
sorry !
i' m sorry !
bullshit !
bullshit !
i' m sorry !
how could you do this to me , lizzie ?
you fucking betrayed me !
no !
they let you go !
i knew they would !
they' ve tapped my phone , they tried to follow me here !
they want me for the whole thing !
they can' t prove anything !
if they could , they would have by now !
you grassed me up , you bitch !
hello ?
hello ?
what happened ?
you' ve got to get me out of here !
please .
i don' t feel safe .
i don' t want to be alone .
i don' t feel safe .
all right .
all right .
liz ...
please .
please !
liz , come on .
calm down .
take a deep breath .
come on .
calm down .
listen , i can help you , but you' ve got to stop playing games .
some people need to know what happened .
they don' t care how terrible your story is .
they want to know the truth .
i want to know the truth too !
i want to go back to the hole .
absolutely not !
no way .
i keep getting glimpses of what happened .
i' il be doing something like tying my laces and i' il turn around ... and i' il see frankie .
but when i try to remember , i can' t .
there' s nothing .
nothing at all .
and i don' t know what happened .
i want to know , but i can' t remember .
do you want to be re admitted ?
and we can work through this .
no .
i need to go back to the hole .
there' s no escape , tom .
mrs dunn called again , ... .. pissing and moaning dr horwood' s run away with her child .
saying she' il call the press , the complaints commission , if we don' t find her !
all right .
but i bet you they' re having a bloody pizza somewhere .
d' you want the rest ?
go on .
amaze me .
i will .
it' s about martin taylor .
come on .
come on !
looks different .
i don' t even feel like i' ve been here before .
liz .
liz .
hey , mikey ?
your weed , mate .
you are the cretin .
dude , you' re getting laid .
it' s gonna be a great time .
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah !
we weren' t locked in from the outside .
shit !
i am in so much trouble !
fuck !
shit , i don' t believe it !
the stupid ...
did you try the glass ?
what could i do ?
i couldn' t let him leave .
carry on .
guys , guys !
the water' s gone off .
are you sure ?
i just went for a drink .
there' s no water .
what ?
what ?
what ?
what' s happened ?
after you start to feel thirsty , ... .. you find yourself feeling impatient .
maybe even a little sick .
then your pulse starts to go up .
then there' s the headaches , dizziness ...
when it gets bad , your vision will blur and you' il find it hard to walk and talk .
your tongue swells up .
your skin shrivels .
you twitch .
you go deaf .
and then you die .
how long does this take ?
from when we run out of water , about three or four days .
how do you know all this ?
army cadets .
liz !
lizzie !
lizzie , it' s gonna be fine !
it' s gonna be ok , liz !
we' re bound to get rescued !
they' il find us .
they will !
next week we' il be down the pub having a laugh .
i promise you .
and i' m buying , all right ?
it' s gonna be all right .
we' il go out and buy lots of new things .
and there' s all those exciting exams to look forward to .
can we look on the positive side ?
no , i' ve got a hard on for those exams .
they' re great .
you' ve got a hard on for everything .
not for you , mate .
i' m ok .
have you ever loved someone so much ... .. you didn' t care what happened to yourself ?
you just had to be with them .
if they look atyou , ... .. yourheart stops .
ifyou feel theirbreath on yourskin , ... .. youjust ache .
have you ever craved someone so much ... .. that you didn' t exist any more ?
no .

jezebel )

frankie' s sick .
look , i' m serious .
she' s very , very sick .
it just keeps coming out of her .
so you' re fucking her now ?
he really doesn' t kiss the way i thought he would .
i always thought he' d kiss me really soft , ....
.. but he kisses really hard .
you know , you could have told me about you and mike .
but i suppose it doesn' t matter any more .
we' re getting on so well !
it' s like we' ve been together for ages .
i think he' s falling in love with me .
he is .
yeah , he is , i can feel it .
we' il probably sleep together tonight .
i bet we' il get out tomorrow .
i have a really strong feeling we' il get out .

i' m sorry , frankie ...
frankie ...
don' t fucking look at me like that !
i hate it when people look at me like that .
it' s not my fault if you don' t like what i have to say .
frances was bulimic .
we know that from the lack of enamel on her teeth .
the dramatic bleeding came from a tear in her oesophagus .
she died on the tenth day from heart failure .
carry on .
do you think she' il haunt us ?
she' il haunt you .
why me ?
why you ?
why you ? !
you fucking bitch !
because it' s your mistake !
your idea , your fault !
you !
does that help at all it' s shit in here .
you !
she' s sorry ! lsn' t it obvious ?
she didn' t do it on purpose !
just fucking leave it !
you didn' t care about fucking frankie !
you' re right .
i didn' t give a fuck about frankie .
we' re just a pair of assholes .
i keep thinking about her mum and her dad ... .. and how they' re going to feel when they find out .
i' ve killed all of you !
i killed ...
no , you didn' t .
i did , it' s my fault !
i' m sorry !
look , ok ?
it' s not your fault , ok ?
it' s not your fault .
i don' t know what happened to frankie , but it wasn' t you , ok ?
really ?
really .
ok ?
so what we' ve got to do is try our best to keep strong .
i don' t really blame you , liz .
i' m just going nuts .
i keep thinking i can smell the body .
i think i' d rather tear my face off ... .. than smell her rot .
i' ve got such a terrible headache .
everything' s blurry .
i know what that means .
it' s all right , geoff .
don' t think about it .
take it .

thank you .

no , stop !
geoffrey bingham .
severe head injuries .
this one was murdered .
oh , my god .
look .
we could go together .
fuck , no .
i can' t do this any more .
this food will keep us going a little longer .
we could still be found .
we' re not going to be found .
they would have found us by now .
look .
mike , it' d be really quick , right ?
we' il just fade away and it' il be over ...
you' re stronger than that !
we' ve kept going this long , we can hold out .
please !
it' s worth it .
lizzie , i can' t do this without you .
you' ve kept me going .
if you go , i' il have nothing .
i need you .
i love you , liz .
i ...
i love you .
how the fuck did you do that ?
the key .
i always had it .
but i couldn' t tell you .
how could l ?
but it ... it was all for you .
for me ?
because i love you .
all this was for you .
for me ?
i killed my best friend .
you let me think i was going to die , and you watched me kill my best friend .
i killed him for a fucking coke !
you let frankie die !
you fucking held her hand ... .. and you let her die , you fucking bitch !
fuckin ' whore !
no , mike ...
you fucking bitch !
you don' t understand !
i didn' t mean ...
mike , no !
what are you doing ?
you don' t understand !
what are you doing ?
stop it !
no , mike !
no !
he was the reason i breathed .
i stayed there , ... .. felt my heart die , ... .. my soul wither .
i wanted to be with him so much ... .. that i couldjust feel myself stepping into the air .
then i thought , at least this way , ... .. he never grows old , he never cheats on me .
he never leaves .
this way hejust ... stays perfect .
you need to say what you' ve just said to me on tape , ... .. with a solicitor and your parents present .
why ?
your statement needs to be official .
i' m not making a statement .
you have to .
that' s what the families and everybody the police have been waiting for .
i just told you : they' re not going to understand .
look , even you don' t understand .
i don' t see why i should be punished .
it was an accident !
you' re still responsible .
i' m not ruining my life for this !
it' s out of your hands .
martin will corroborate what you' ve told me .
everyone is dead , and you told them that i locked you in !
i was away !
i had no idea you couldn' t get out !
it' s too late .
no !
philippa !
what the fuck are you doing ?
help !
help !
thank god .
thank god .
what' s wrong ?
help !

it' s ok .
i thought she was going to hurt me .
it' s over .

yeah .
suicide .
guilty as hell .
