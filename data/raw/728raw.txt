sat .
suck ass test .
that' s what that stands for .
this is the sat i examination .
for the first section , you have 30 minutes .
last year , 2 million kids took the suck ass test in order to get into college .
scores range from 500 , you' re going to community college , riding a bus , to 1 600 , you' re ivy league , driving a porsche .
it' s a standardized test .
standardized , meaning they see us all the same .
a kid ... ... is a kid ... ... is a kid !
take this kid , for instance .
kyle .
he' s a good guy , who knows where he wants to go in life .
but for now , the sat is standing in the way of kyle' s dream .
it' s telling him , " you' re just ...
time .
then there' s anna , the overachiever .
you know the type .
a future ph. d. with a nice a s s.
good deeds , good grades .
but the sat doesn' t care about that .
you could be the class brain , a kid in the middle or dumb as a post .
when you walk into this room , it' s not about who you are .
the sat is about who you' il be .
well , i' ve seen worse .
i need a 1430 .
i' ve applied to cornell .
and what are your fallback schools ?
i don' t have any .
that' s kind of risky , isn' t it ?
i mean , i' m looking at your file here , and while your gpa is strong , your psat score wasn' t so great .
don' t you think that 1430 is ... ?
is a little bit ... ?
when i was 7 , i built a log cabin out of popsicle sticks .
you can go in the halls , and five out of six kids are not gonna have a clue what they wanna do the rest of their lives .
but mr. dooling ... i' ve known since i was 7 .
i want to be an architect .
as soon as i was old enough to realize there' s one school that turns out the greatest architects of our time ,
i' ve wanted to go there .
cornell university .
cornell .
you know the guy who designed our bus barn ?
he attended a community college just down the street .
dooling said you couldn' t do it ?
that' s matty , kyle' s right hand man .
they say misery loves company .
well , it really loves matty .
dooling said the standardized testing says i can' t do it .
you' re down to a 1 020 ?
jesus , that' s almost as bad as me , man .
what' d you tell your parents ?
what do you think ?
we' ve never been so proud , son .
it' s good .
look it .
hundred and forty three .
that' s what i scored .
remember , mom ?
well , look at the positives .
at least one of us is going to college .
hello , maryland .
matty' s girlfriend , sandy , is a freshman at maryland .
and he was now moments away from hooking up with her in the fall .
open the letter , matty .
yeah , you' re right .
why should the fact that you' re screwed ruin my big day , huh ?
oh , shit !
sat score insufficient .
this shit ain' t fair !
sandy' s gonna be crushed .
you even know what sat stands for ?
suck ass test ?
scholastic aptitude test .
then they got rid of that altogether .
you know what it stands for now ?
sat .
what ?
sat stands for sat .
that' s it .
that' s fucked up .
yeah , i know .
sever all ties , sat .
i may as well sever all ties with sandy .
there must be somebody we can talk to .
there' s no one we can talk to ?
do you know how many kids wanna go up and complain about their sats ?
i mean , if one goes up , they all go up .
what about her ?
unless your father owns the building ...
so we' il take the test again .
retest is in two weeks .
there' s no time to get ready .
and even if there was , what' s gonna change ?
i better call sandy .
she' s gonna love this .
yeah , sandy' s room .
some guy answered .
roommate' s boyfriend .
he said , " sandy' s room .
so ?
so her roommate' s pam .
he' d say , " pam' s room " , not " sandy' s room .
pam' s room !
pam !
all right .
all right , matty .
you' re wired .
it' s the red bull .
no !
no !
no !
the sat did this !
the sat is pimping out my girlfriend !
damn it !
we gotta do something , man .
they' re messing with the rest of our lives .
matty , the college board made millions of dollars last year .
you think they give a shit about us ?
just hear me out .
because i' m not a dumb guy , all right ?
i know things .
ask me ...
ask me who' s got the best pitching staff in baseball .
or ask me ...
ask me how to rebuild a carburetor on a ' 71 buick .
ask me ...
ask me what icing is , for chrissakes .
make the point , matty .
the point is , where the hell' s that on the test ?
because you learn the rest in college .
i show up for a job interview , there' s a science geek , there' s a math nerd .
who' s gonna get the job ?
the guy who can throw down at the water cooler , who' s heard the new ataris disk .
the guy who yakked in your cutlass after the radiohead show .
me !
me !
that' s me .
i get the job .
i' m still seeing no point .
the point is that they are not playing fair .
why should we ?
we know where the answers are .
ets .
maybe we should borrow them .
you want to steal the answers to the sat ?
you have a talent , kyle .
what you do with a pencil and paper , i can' t learn that .
they have a test you' re never gonna pass .
kids struggle with the sat .
that doesn' t justify thievery .
no ?
did you see my dad' s truck when you drove up ?
it' s the one with the large crapper on top of it .
it doesn' t say " matthews ' septic " on it , kyle .
it says " matthews and son' s septic " on it .
look , if i don' t get into maryland , my life is shit .
literally .
and it' s not even my own shit .
kyle .
dude , check this out .
listen , listen .
ready ?
ready ?
watch this .
thank you , princeton , new jersey !
think i did " smoke on the water .
you hear that ?
i' m worried about you , kyle .
one day , you' re gonna try to regain this lost youth of yours , you' re gonna go into a shit pit .
is that what you' re doing , living at home , jamming with the dryer ?
i don' t live at home .
i live above the garage .
it' s a whole separate dwelling !
i' ve got my own phone line .
hey , honey .
you wanna help grade assignments ?
we' re teaching kids to bubble in .
first graders ?
mom , most of these kids can' t even read yet .
well , i hate to say it , but there' s more money for the school in bubbling in than reading these days .
now he gets it .
just follow the money .
standardized testing is taking over .
and it starts long before high school .
test scores go up , the schools get more cash .
in some cases , even teachers get paid .
it' s enough to piss you off .
i mean , when you get the feeling that everything' s slipping away , that you' re gonna be left behind , desperate times call for desperate measures .
hey , matty , if you wanted to borrow the answers ... ... how would you do it ?
the girl at ets .
the one the guard let pass .
you recognize her ?
francesca curtis .
the web page girl ?
francesca curtis .
talk about your forbidden fruit .
do you guys know the name of that kid with the percocet addiction ?
no ?
no ?
no ?
i don' t know .
ok .
if you have something for my page , you have to write it down and slip it in my locker .
i' il get back to you .
no , we' re not ...
if you don' t know where my locker is , you' re in over your heads .
actually ... ... we had something else in mind .
so you guys are gonna steal the sat answers ?
you should .
you should .
i mean , it' s anti girl , it' s anti ... a lot of shit , but it definitely has girl issues .
it under scores us on the math and verbal .
on top of that , the college board settled a complaint that the psat had a testicle bias for national merit scholarships .
so you' il help us , then ?
no .
why not ?
pacey , i don' t think you and dawson can pull it off .
do you have a plan ?
we' re working on it .
oh , ok .
you' re wasting my time .
wait .
don' t you find it ridiculous that from day one , they tell us to be unique , to be individuals , then they give us a standardized test that makes us all one faceless herd ?
desmond rhodes , superstar !
wait , wait , wait .
hold on .
a hundred million dollars a year , 60 million of that from girls .
for what ?
to pick up a few stones to throw at a bully that doesn' t fight fair ?
look around this place .
how many of these girls are gonna get screwed by this test ?
what' s that gonna do to their self esteem ?
on top of everything else they deal with .
you' re preaching to the converted .
i know i am .
that' s why we approached you .
we need your help .
what the hell .
it sounds like fun .
i told you .
desmond rhodes , superstar !
desmond rhodes , all city .
but his grades are shitty .
what do you think ?
i look good in red .
i was thinking more of a philadelphia 76er red , though .
is that why you haven' t taken the sats yet ?
the pros ?
maybe .
may i speak honestly ?
please , i wish you would .
des , i want you to come to st. john' s .
because the fact of the matter is , your game is not ready .
if you come with me ,
i' il do everything in my power to get you to the nba .
but if , god forbid , you don' t make it , you' re gonna have a degree in one hand , and you' re gonna be prepared for life after basketball .
now , you see , that' s what i' m talking about .
so where do we go from here ?
well , that' s up to you .
you know , your grade point average is a little bit on the low end for us at st. john' s , but we can work with that .
what you need is , you need 900 or better on the sats .
hey , matty , don' t freak out , ok ?
about what ?
just don' t .
i won' t .
what' s up ?
what are you doing ?
remember the photographer at the basketball game ?
the girl on the base line ?
you told anna ?
you said you wouldn' t freak out .
that was before i knew you told the class brain .
well , i' m sorry , matty .
you ever think maybe we' re not the only ones in this boat ?
what boat ?
it' s anna ross .
i know .
what do you ... ?
what ... ?
what ... ?
well , what' d she say anyway ?
you know , i don' t even know you , but even if i did , what you' re talking about is wrong .
it' s cheating .
it' s a victimless crime .
ok .
you' re driving , it' s late , you get to a red light in the middle of nowhere .
do you run the light ?
you see ?
you don' t .
you wait .
because a victimless crime is still a crime .
it isn' t worth it .
maybe it is .
maybe i run it .
it depends .
on what ?
am i trying to get somewhere important ?
so she' s in ?
she said no .
yeah , but she knows about it .
oh , you like this girl ?
matty ...
no , no , no .
if you' re trying to get into her pants ...
matt , it wasn' t like that .
i just got the feeling ...
something tells me she needs this as bad as we do .
oh , ok , something tells you .
something tells you just to walk up to anna ross and invite her to break into ets to steal the answers to the sat ?
some inner voice signed off on this ?
yeah , it did , all right , matt ?
that is great , kyle .
hey , that' s me .
just because they keep getting younger doesn' t mean you will .
oh , here she is !
the game run late ?
anna' s the yearbook photographer .
yeah , yes .
a little .
this is tom hackett , a friend who might be able to help us with brown .
hi , anna .
it' s a pleasure to meet you .
hi .
well , come on , honey , sit down .
let me get that .
it' s just her camera gear .
here , sweetheart .
so , great , great .
so , anna , what types of things are you interested in besides photography ?
tell him about the pledge drive you coordinated .
so wonderful .
tell him about the pledge drive you coordinated .
so wonderful .
we asked students to sign a pledge to refrain from drug use and ...
yeah , it was very successful .
that' s great .
she' s also involved in several other community related projects ...
hey , kiddo .
i think that went well .
oh , guess we won .
yep , they did .
your father and i have noticed the effort you' ve put into this retest .
what if i mess it up again ?
you won' t .
you' re gonna do great .
we' re really proud of you , honey .
hi , who' s this ?
cleo ?
i think i dialed the wrong number , but you sound familiar .
what' s your thursday morning class ?
m. e. lecture ?
mine too .
yeah .
well , listen , i won' t keep you any longer , but before you go , my roommates and i are having this discussion .
maybe you can help .
yeah , what' s the lowest sat score you ever heard of anyone who' s gotten into brown ?
thanks .
ets has the entire top floor .
can you get us up there ?
well , probably , but then what ?
i don' t know .
we' re not talking about a big heist .
it' s as easy as getting in , finding the answers , making a copy and getting out .
we just gotta think of the easiest way to do it .
you' ve assembled a crack team , chief .
well , what was i supposed to do ?
he knows everything .
he threatened to bust us .
so does anna ross , but she' s not here .
you told anna ross ?
yeah .
he had a feeling about her .
hey , was it anywhere near your crotch ?
hey , guys .
i have an idea .
the mailroom services the entire building .
they hire a lot of guys straight out of high school .
they won' t know you .
just act like you own the place .
yeah , easy for you to say .
you do .
you want to know what we' re up against or not ?
you' il be fine .
cornell still worth it ?
yeah .
sandy ?
yeah .
good .
good .
because we' re in it now .
can i help you ?
these are the new mailroom slaves .
you guys forgot your badges .
losers !
let' s go .
pay attention .
roy , what the hell are you doing here ?
other than bailing you out ?
how did you get in here ?
i' m the ghost , man .
by the way , just so you know , mail pickup was this morning .
waiting till the last minute , huh ?
hey .
hi .
take a look at that .
nice .
thanks , eh .
you think you can help me with that ?
photography ?
no , that .
no .
i can' t .
come on , anna .
for me ?
you ever heard of the term " stereotype vulnerability " ?
it means that some students do badly on the sat only because they know they' re expected to .
i' il tell you about stereotype vulnerability .
you mess up on the sat , you gotta live with it .
your parents , maybe .
but if i do , i gotta read about it in " usa today " .
desmond rhodes is a dumb ass .
you know , just because i play ball , teachers have been letting me slide through forever .
i' m not trying to say it' s their fault , because it' s not .
i did what i did .
if there' s some way i could just get around this one thing ...
it all means more to me now .
that' s all i' m trying to say .
excuse me .
who are you ?
who am l ?
who are you ?
this is my office .
yeah .
i' m from the mailroom .
well , do you have something for me ?
yeah .
well , could you give it to me ?
yes , i can .
my bad .
let me get that for you .
anything else i can do for you while i' m down here ?
hey , hey .
you .
yeah , copy room , right ?
right , right .
great .
i need two copies of this on rush .
one comes to me , one goes to ann clark , and the master goes to 51 0 , got it ?
sure .
great .
hey !
what are you doing ?
i' m casing the joint .
oh , thank you !
here .
we take it , they might get suspicious .
they can change it by next saturday .
copy it .
copy it .
say hello to your future , matty .
septic and toilets , sat .
come on , man , it was a good run .
what run ?
there was no run .
what run ?
there was no run .
yeah , well , whatever it was , it' s over .
francesca was right .
we were screwed .
well , at least she didn' t bring the cops .
or maybe not .
if i wanted to do what we talked about ... ... will you need to know why ?
no , but i don' t think that' s gonna be possible now .
hey , can i ask you something ?
why' d you bail on your exam ?
i didn' t .
i saw your answer sheet .
it was practically blank .
i was doing fine at first .
then i came to a story question .
a woman boards a train in new york at midnight .
three hours later , a man also boards .
for some reason , i couldn' t get past it .
where was this woman going ?
why was she alone ?
time .
i know it probably sounds crazy , but it just hit home for me , and i ...
i wanted to be on that train and just be ... ... gone , somewhere .
i guess i just froze .
when i got home ,
i realized how disappointed my parents would be .
i need to do great on this test .
yeah .
well , like i said , it' s ...
if it' s money you want , we can pay you .
no , it' s not money , it' s ...
we " ?
yeah , there' s someone else besides me .
please .
don' t say no .
yes !
yes !
no !
come on , matt .
what is wrong with you ?
it' s one more person .
it' s desmond rhodes .
besides , i heard he was going pro .
no , man .
he' s not strong enough to be a four , not quick enough to be a three .
besides , he' s got no left hand , and his midrange game , it needs work .
i don' t see it .
i mean , anna ross , that' s bad enough .
but do you know how high profile desmond rhodes is ?
he knows about it , and he wants in .
anna says he needs it and we can trust him .
anna says he needs it .
what are we , a fricking soup kitchen ?
which brings me to point number two .
last i heard , we had no way of doing this .
i' ve been thinking about that .
hey .
hey .
was your father suspicious ?
oh , no , to be suspicious , he' d have to be interested .
there are security codes too .
they' ve got to supply the building owner with a copy , in case of an emergency .
yeah , i can get them .
ok .
ok .
ok .
i will see you tuesday .
ok , i' il see you tuesday .
francesca .
yeah ?
that bad , huh ?
my father ?
no , whatever .
i mean , you know , poor little rich girl thing is played out .
it' s like the oldest story in the world , isn' t it ?
not if it' s your story .
all right , i' il see you on tuesday .
i will see you tuesday .
bye .
and sometimes , it' s that easy .
shit happens .
people join the cause .
and you find yourself moving towards something you didn' t plan on approaching .
only , by the time you' re aware of it , the plans of one become the plans of six .
and the plans of six become one .
we' re eating .
yeah .
bro , what' s up ?
who is this ?
it' s roy , from the sat thing .
how did you get this number ?
i' m the ghost , man .
give it to me .
who' s calling , please ?
what ?
it' s ...
roy .
well , roy , this is our dinnertime .
we don' t interrupt your dinnertime , do we ?
i don' t have dinnertime .
well , that' s a shame .
now , do you have some business with my son ?
well , i am , at this time , assisting him in his sat exam preparation .
and i was wondering if he could possibly pick me up this evening , as i am currently without transportation .
oh , sat .
well , there' s hope for you yet , roy .
why don' t you give me that address .
i appreciate that , ma' am .
and ... ... may i say that you have an attractive voice ?
it' s ... ... very pleasant .
young sounding .
the address , please .
4207 triumph street .
with a t.
triumph .
all right .
he' il be there .
thanks .
thank you , roy .
oh , god .
be on time .
francesca , tiffany .
tiffany , my daughter , francesca .
hi .
peace .
peace .
oh , no .
p l e c e. you .
no .
she was just kidding .
dog , cool .
socks .
sweet .
what school gave you this ?
it' s my uncle' s ride , man .
what school gave it to your uncle ?
why do you call yourself " the ghost " ?
at school , man , i hear things and i see things , but nobody hears or sees me .
you think ?
i got your cell number , didn' t l ?
so ?
you got mine ?
this fool is crazy .
don' t touch my shit .
eight o' clock .
you' re positive your brother' s not there ?
we got the place to ourselves .
he promised .
you' re sure ?
yeah .
oh , shit !
oh , that' s my brother .
hey .
what' s going on ?
salute .
salute .
sorry , bro .
hope it comes out .
what' s up ?
what the hell is this ?
you said we could have the place tonight .
was that supposed to be tonight ?
because tonight is wine tasting ...
wine tasting tuesday .
what' s up ?
oh , yeah .
wow , what' s this ?
wine tasting tuesday .
nice .
look , larry , larry ...
you promised .
yeah , i know .
but maybe we can do it next tuesday .
all right , this is ets .
this is so cute , this whole thing going ...
i' m sorry .
it was a misunderstanding .
man , what the hell is she typing ?
i' m just taking notes .
all right , this is ets .
who took that photo ?
anna took it .
i' m not sure i' m comfortable with this .
you look comfortable in your old navy cotton pullover .
you gotta get this look .
did i do something ?
yeah .
you did , you got a 4 . 0 gpa .
francesca , just stop it , all right ?
do you know what the fatal flaw is for most heists ?
it' s trusting the team .
so excuse me for being a bitch , but why is the valedictorian here ?
i' m not the valedictorian .
i' m second .
that explains everything .
everyone has reasons .
we don' t need to know them .
really ?
i think we do .
it' s like " the breakfast club " , where they get stoned and make confessions .
oh , sweet .
maybe we should .
maybe we should say why we' re here .
kyle said we wouldn' t have to , so ...
i think we do .
so i' il start .
i' m here to make new friends .
and for the wine , of course .
how about you , superstar ?
i' m here because the sat is racist .
well , that didn' t take long , now , did it ?
you don' t think so ?
who created the test ?
rich white guys .
who has the highest scores ?
asian chicks .
middle class asian girls who watch less than an hour of television a day .
they can' t drive , but they can take the shit out of the sat .
whatever .
why you here ?
because i' m not smart enough to get the score i need , as opposed to being a genius
who' s screwed by the man .
matty ...
it is .
it' s unfair to certain groups .
like kiss ass valedictorians .
i' m not the valedictorian .
right , you' re second .
all right !
enough , ok ?
this is the floor plan for the regional ets office tower .
here' s the hardware schedule with security camera specs that are here , here , here and here .
it' s fruity , and yet , woody .
roy !
pay attention .
please .
francesca has the lock codes , and we know where the test answers are filed .
shit .
if you guys think we can somehow ...
yeah .
yo !
this thing hemp ?
this is never gonna work .
it' il be ok .
yeah , we' re gonna be great .
i mean , all state' s phone is ringing off the hook here , and
roy' s trying to smoke larry' s comforter .
hey , roy !
roy !
i' m serious , you' re about out of here !
shit .
shit .
need some help with that ?
no , not unless you can code visual basic .
yeah .
what did you do ?
i don' t know .
some shit with the dynamic variables .
so are we gonna do this , or what ?
yeah , we are .
can you turn off the phone ?
you got a problem with me ?
i got a problem with anybody putting us at risk .
so you think it' s me ?
fine .
i don' t need this shit , no way .
anna , you down with this ?
you guys see desmond on tv this weekend ?
playing for st. john' s .
he took 25 and 10 off north carolina .
matty , you saw it , right ?
you were at your apartment with sandy in maryland .
i missed it .
i had a date .
but my roommate at brown is a big sports fan ,
and she said it was great .
you know what ?
it was .
i saw the whole thing from my cornell dorm room .
roy , you had money on it .
well , i hope you covered the spread .
we can do this .
we can all get where each one of us wants to go , but we have got to trust each other .
you talk a good game , but i think your mom' s gonna come in with snacks .
this is serious .
some of us got a lot to lose .
i think that we all have a lot to lose .
all right , fair enough .
just hear me out .
anyone who doesn' t like the plan can walk .
ok .
all right .
friday afternoon , francesca will enter through the lobby .
the same as any other friday .
then she' il make appointments for me and matty with her dad' s firm .
what if he recognizes you ?
he won' t recognize me .
oh , he might .
hey , get down !
freeze !
hands up !
he won' t recognize me .
once i' m up and in , matty' s gonna sign in and join us in francesca' s father' s office .
where am i gonna be ?
you' re waiting in the woods nearby .
with that big ass crow ?
alone ?
no , with desmond and anna .
oh , roy .
yeah , baby , you feel that ?
give it to me .
who' s your daddy now ?
come on .
maybe we should all go together .
we need you on the outside for when the night guard makes his rounds .
their rotation isn' t really precise , and we' re gonna have flashlights .
so we' il watch out for the guards to make sure you cut them off .
right .
exactly , exactly .
now , inside , francesca' s gonna ask the guard to disconnect the alarm on the rear door , saying she has boxes to unload from her car , something she' s done before .
hold it right there .
matty and i have 20 seconds to get inside the stairwell before the guard returns to his desk and his security monitors .
we' il take the stairs to the roof and wait for francesca' s keycard .
from here , we' re almost home .
we get in , we get the answers , and we get out .
shortly after midnight , this is me .
twenty five minutes into saturday morning , and a whole lot closer to the rest of my life .
who' s gonna join me ?
all right .
you smoke ?
it makes kissing kind of nasty .
then we won' t be kissing , huh ?
i know .
i was just ...
why are you here ?
i need the answers .
to join sandy at maryland .
what' s so great about her , i mean , aside from being smoke free ?
you wouldn' t get it .
try me .
all right .
i mean , it' s like , i don' t get the best grades .
i' m not really great at ... anything .
but here was something that i was finally great at .
i was great at being with sandy .
i could make her laugh , i could ... ... guess what she was thinking .
and it was just ... ... great .
it was great .
and ?

when i was a kid ,
i used to play this video game for hours , " street fighter 2 " .
and i remember thinking , " you know , people get paid to do this .
to think up the game and to create the characters .
like there' s this one character , blanka .
he' s , like , half human and half lizard , who eats his opponents .
well , i mean , you know , he either zaps them with lightning or he ... ... bites their faces off .
it' s pretty cool , huh ?
so you' d design video games .
no .
i' d kind of like to be blanka .
i was thinking someday i might wanna be an actor .
as opposed to solving world hunger or curing a terminal disease ?
see what i mean ?
i would run a no kill animal shelter .
or ...
i' d just be a mom .
not just a mother .
i would be a real mom .
you know , one who cared more about the title of " parent " than the one on her business card .
or porn .
hey , guys , he' s here .
dave' s here .
she opens up the door , you haul ass .

" verification master " .
mercer county sat exam to be administered fall 2004 " .

you need three other passwords and three other people to print .
can' t you figure it out ?
sure .
just give me six months and a cla mainframe .
well , that was fun .
the exam' s right here .
yeah , you just need the answers .
exactly .
oh , i get it .
come on , team .
makes perfect sense .
we' il take the test now so we can steal our own answers .
then we' il take the real test with the stolen answers we were afraid would be wrong in the first place .
it' s nice .
it' s really nice .
so who wants pancakes ?
wait .
guys , the exam' s right here .
maybe it was bigger than us one on one , but it can' t beat us all together .
kyle , come on , man .
matty , just try this , ok ?
lf it takes 1 5 people eight hours to make 100 items ,
how many hours will it take six people ,
working at the same rate , to make half as many items ?
ten .
ten hours .
d. ten .
she' s second in the class .
all right , all right , let' s see .
a ten quart mixture consists of one part juice to nine parts water ...
jesus , what lightweight' s making this drink ?
lf x quarts of juice and y quarts of water are added to make
a 27 quart mixture that consists of one part juice to two parts water ,
what is the value of x ?
nine .
c is nine .
no .
it says , if x quarts of juice are added , what is the value of x ?
we already have one part juice .
so nine minus one equals x.
eight .
yeah .
d is eight .
he' s right .
sorry .
no .
guys , don' t be sorry .
that' s two down .
we can walk away right now , but what are we walking away to ?
i say we trust each other and try as a group .
he' s right .
we can do this .
unless we run out of time .
so we split it up .
can you access this from another computer ?
as long as it' s in this office .
done .
all right .
someone' s gotta take a crack at verbal .
francesca ?
no , no .
me and words are not so goodly .
ok , anna , you and i will do verbal .
someone' s gotta do math .
i' il do it .
you sure ?
it could be a little ...
have you ever heard of the term , " kiss my ass " ?
math doesn' t scare me .
you just take care of the verbal .
ok , who' s helping des ?
well , i guess i can .
but only with quadratic equations , coordinate geometry and algebraic visualizations .
well , if you want ...
yeah .
yeah .
hey .
well , hasselhoff , it looks like you and me .
we' il watch the lobby .
you don' t have to wait there .
guard' s not due for a couple hours .
you know , sandy liked this blue color .
true berry blue .
not anymore .
you said , " liked " .
you said , " sandy liked " .
likes .
whatever .
what' s wrong , she doesn' t call anymore ?
no , she calls .
she calls .
yeah , but not like before .
she' s busy .
matty , it' s over .
it' s never gonna be like the way it was .
don' t ...
look , you don' t know anything about it , ok ?
well , i know it' s not healthy .
yeah , and folding yourself up into a web page because daddy doesn' t love you enough is , huh ?
i' m sorry , i didn' t mean that .
then why' d you say it ?
because she doesn' t call anymore .
remember when you said that you were great at being sandy' s boyfriend ?
well , you weren' t .
that' s nice , francesca .
why don' t you just rub it in a little ...
you weren' t great at being some girl' s boyfriend , matty .
you just found someone who let you be ok with yourself .
" x is to y ...
as this shit is to boring .
what score do you need on the test anyway ?
a 900 .
and you' re taking the math for us ?
i was afraid of the verbal , roy .
i can ace the math and still not get a 900 .
so why don' t you go pro ?
you don' t know my mom , man .
she all about college degrees .
she worked three jobs .
if i blow my knee out in college , all i got is credits .
if i blow my knee out in the nba , i got a four year guaranteed contract .
millions .
so , what does she say when you tell her that ?
i can' t .
you just don' t know my mom , man .
all this because you can' t talk to your mom ?
can you talk to yours ?
my mom' s dead .
but if she wasn' t ...
yeah .
i think i could talk to her .
let me get in there , huh ?
you know , a lot of people think these questions are difficult .
not me .
no ?
no .
these questions all have answers .
we good ?
yeah .
all right , let' s get out of here .
roy , what' s in your bag ?
nothing .
i needed some school supplies .
roy , you can' t take this stuff .
why not ?
if anything' s missing , francesca gets busted .
so ?
why did you take the guy' s photo ?
dude , his wife is hot .
look .
come on , i' il help him take it back .
we' il wait here .
anna and i will be on the roof .
i can' t believe it .
this is so awesome .
you got your answers .
yeah , that too , you know , but it' s all of it .
we did it .
we haven' t done anything yet .
what' s going on with you ?
i don' t know .
i' m having fun , i guess .
i mean , i know how people see me .
like , one of those perfect girls that everything always works out for .
i just always wanted to punch one of them in the face .
i' m not a robot , you know ?
i just haven' t done very much .
yet .
if it helps , there' s a lot of stuff i haven' t done too .
yeah , but i' ve never really done anything .
i mean , i' ve never broken curfew , and i' ve never cut class , and i' ve never ... ... made out on a rooftop .
shit .
what' s going on ?
what happened ?
someone' s here .

we gotta go .
this shit' s wrong .
we' re not gonna leave her .
we don' t have a choice .
hell , no .
i' il go .
if you don' t get through the skylight , we all get screwed .
francesca knew the risk , so did you .

we' re gonna use the keycard to get out .
desmond and roy go right .
we go left .

i' il bring copies of this in the morning .
come on .
so how' d it go ?
don' t you sleep ?
not tonight .
happened to you , kid ?
what happened to me ?
what happened to you , larry ?
you were supposed to be my big brother .
what am i now , the walking dead ?
well , yeah , pretty much .
i mean , how do you think mom and dad feel ?
i don' t know .
how do you think they feel ?
well , i don' t know , larry .
not good , probably .
let me ask you a question .
a son who lives above the garage , or a son who cheats his way into college ?
next time you pull a heist , don' t leave your plans on my bed , idiot .
matty got arrested .
so , what do you think , fair trade ?
i think that' s a shitty thing to ask .
at least you' re starting to sound like my little brother .
maybe he' s actually in there somewhere .
is there anything you don' t know , larry ?
there is plenty i don' t know .
but i' il tell you something you don' t know .
did you know that every christmas after you go to bed , dad , mom and i always sit up , and we talk about how proud we are of you ?
how great it is to see this kid , right , his whole future in front of him .
and how he deserves that ... ... because he' s a good guy and he does the right thing .
every christmas for how long ?
i don' t know , ten years or something .
you don' t think i would like to sit up with my family on christmas ?
yeah , but you' d just stress us out .
good night , little brother .
word of advice .
why not ?
never take advice from anyone who lives above a garage .
how long since your mother passed , baby ?
nine years ago .
i was 8 .
that' s a shame .
my son tells me you encouraged him to talk to me .
you' re a smart boy , roy .
so why are you doing a stupid thing like drugs ?
something to do .
something to do ?
you know how they say , " thank god my mother' s not alive to see this " ?
no .
well , somebody' s mother is , roy , and i am not happy with this .
i' m sorry ?
you get yourself a shower and some clean clothes .
we' il wait .
fix you some breakfast before the exam .
ok ?
i' ve been thinking about that , mrs ...
desmond' s mom .
i' m not taking that exam .
i mean , you know , let' s face it , i' m not going to college .
see , and even if i did ,
i' d just be taking the place of someone that really wanted to be there more than me .
you' re a smart boy , roy .
but there' s a whole lot of dumb dribbling out of your mouth right now .
now , did you hear what i said about a shower and clean clothes ?
yes .
yes , ma' am .
you' il find i don' t like to repeat myself .
get your ass up !
yes , ma' am .
fool .
damn .
not everybody can pull it off , but the dashing criminal thing
looks good on you .
yeah ?
wait until you smell it .
you know what i was thinking in there ?
i need to work on being alone .
or not .
anyone ever tell you you' re a hell of a kisser ?
yeah .
not as good as my cellmate , ramn .
but it' s not bad .
what about the exam ?
well , here' s the thing .
after a night in jail with the worst version of who you can be someday , the sat ain' t nothing .
how about you ?
you gonna be all right ?
yeah .
i think it' s gonna be a nice day .
sick and twisted , sat .
secretly a tease .
i completely have lost touch with who you are .
unacceptable , anna .
you' re out all night doing god knows what with god knows whom .
you' re jeopardizing everything that we' ve worked for on the eve of the biggest day of your life .
this is the real world .
you remember that .
you feel pressured , deal with it .
feel stressed , deal with it .
you do not stay out all night .
do you hear me ?
this is your last chance to get into brown .
oh , you know what ?
that reminds me , i' m not going to brown .
now you deal with it .
wow .
check you out .
i just told my mom i' m not going to brown .
the guys at brown will be disappointed .
hell , the girls at brown are gonna be disappointed .
if not brown , where you gonna go ?
i don' t know .
europe , maybe , then college .
what' s up ?
no .
really ?
i already nailed the math , and plus , you don' t know my mom .
roy ?
shit , man , you don' t know d' s mom .
i wanted to go back and get you , but kyle said screw y' all .
oh , yeah ?
you look like a slut .
i like it .
thank you .
i' m sorry , man .
shut up , don' t be .
besides ... ... it' s not that bad .
no , i don' t need them .
come on , man , take them .
i' m serious .
take them .
no , i' m not taking the test again .
matt , you got arrested .
hey !
unbelievable .
francesca ?
no .
all right , guys , what is this ?
what ?
i wasn' t in it for the answers .
besides , i got a 1460 last semester .
you didn' t tell us that .
you didn' t ask .
wait .
does this mean you' re out , too , now ?
do i look like i need answers ?
you look like you need a pimp .
wait , wait .
are you telling me that after all of this , nobody' s gonna even use these answers ?
you are , aren' t you ?
no .
kyle , this is your dream , man .
yeah , it is , but if they want to put a number on that , then to hell with them .
i know who i am .
yeah ?
yeah .
when did you have this little moment of clarity ?
about the same time my jackass best friend got arrested .
so all of this was for nothing ?
i wouldn' t call this nothing .
man , screw this .
you have 30 minutes .
ok , so i didn' t cheat on the test .
but no way was i gonna let those answers go to waste .
next year at harvard , sat stands for stoned and toasted .
speaking of college , desmond kicked ass on the retest and decided to play ball at st. john' s university .
his mom was happy .
and trust me , you want d' s mom happy .
matty survived probation and some serious community service .
he once told me that he might like to be an actor .
if not , then just happy .
he' s working on both .
francesca sold her first novel .
it' s about six kids who conspire to steal the sat answers .
if they make a movie out of it , i wonder who' il play me ?
he better be hung like a horse .
kyle did fine on his exam .
anna crushed him .
he' s in syracuse , where his dream of becoming an architect is still alive .
anna went off to europe and eventually found her way to college on her own terms .
now , every other weekend in new york , when a woman boards a train at midnight and a man boards that same train , now we know what happens .
life happens .
romance .
adventure .
the stuff you won' t find on a test .
i had the highest test score in the county , but that didn' t exactly offset my 0 . 0 gpa .
eventually , i was forced , i mean , encouraged , to get my ged .
i still spend most of my time at home on video games .
in fact , the number one selling game last year was created by me .
that' s right , baby .
standardize this .
