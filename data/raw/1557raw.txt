hello , matthew , what are you doing here so late ?
i came to get the books .
i want to study our accounts .
we' ve been doing very well lately .
over 200 paid admissions today .
you call that good saturday business ?
if you weren' t so stubborn , we' d be turning them away from here .
who cares a hang about history in wax ?
there are people in the world who love beauty .
but more who want sensation , shock !
morbidly curious !
i won' t cater to them .
their money is as good as anybody else' s .
you should have seen them turning them away at that wax museum ... on 23rd street tonight : the eden muse .
the story' s the same at madame tussaud' s in london .
if you' d only listened to me  i know , matthew .
i' d put in a chamber of horrors : murder , torture , executions ... scare the life out of people .
i don' t care for that kind of patronage !
you' re a great artist , a genius sculptor .
i' m an ordinary businessman who wants a quick return on his investment .
i' ve put $20, 000 in this historic peep show of yours .
i could use that to better advantage .
all right , matthew .
i' ve known for some time you wanted to dissolve our partnership .
i may be able to accommodate you .
how ?
a friend is bringing sidney wallace , the art critic , to see my work tonight .
wallace is rich , and i think i might persuade him to buy you out .
that sounds interesting .
i' il want a profit on my investment .
yes , matthew .
i understand .
you leave everything to me , and i promise you it will be
that should be they , now .
i' il wait in the office .
i' ve heard of wallace .
he has a pot of money .
if he likes your stuff , put a stiff price on it .
does jarrod live here ?
yes , he has a room upstairs .
you' il like him , sidney .
he speaks your language .
please come in .
i' m happy to see you , bruce .
i thought you wouldn' t come on such a bad night .
we were delayed .
he had to be at a gallery .
mr. sidney wallace .
professor jarrod .
a pleasure .
for me also , professor .
that title was bestowed on me when i became an exhibitor .
it has little to do with my real work .
if you come , i will show you what that work is .
the visit of such a distinguished critic ... may cause my children to become conceited .
to you , they' re wax .
but to me , their creator , they live and breathe .
here we have two great lovers from the past .
cleopatra , queen of egypt , and mark antony .
their last meeting .
you' il recall , antony , believing cleopatra to be dead ... killed himself with his own sword .
when cleopatra found out what happened , she quickly followed her lover .
you noticed how cleverly the hair is mounted on the scalp ?
yes .
how do you do that ?
real hair of the proper color and texture ... is pressed into the slightly warmed wax with a scalpel ... one hair at a time .
each wave and curl of the subject' s own hair is reproduced .
here' s president lincoln and his assassin , john wilkes booth ... one of my few concessions to the macabre .
that' s the best figure of booth i' ve ever seen .
you almost expect him to speak .
i wonder what he' d say .
i' m sure he' d rant a bit .
even after he shot lincoln and jumped from the president' s box onto the stage ... he couldn' t resist turning to the audience and taking a bow .
i found him a very stubborn person .
stubborn ?
unbelievably .
for days i argued with this fellow before he posed the way i wanted him to .
you mean , he talked back to you ?
of course .
it' s not easy to shut an actor' s mouth .
these groups are like dimensional paintings of the old masters .
this is not only a great show , it' s an art exhibit .
that' s what i told you .
here we have joan of arc , a favorite subject of mine .
i understand that .
it' s beautifully done .
thank you .
i' ve done her over a dozen times , and still she doesn' t complain .
what was wrong with her ?
there are no authentic portraits available ... so sculptors and painters have to work from models .
i' ve never found the right one , but i will someday .
it' s a shame to race through this exhibit .
these figures should be studied .
you' re very kind .
my creations have some merit , i suspect ... but in bringing back to life the lovely marie antoinette ...
i feel i' ve done my best work .
i' ve never seen anything so exquisite .
people say they can see my marie antoinette breathe ... that her breast rises and falls .
look at her eyes , they follow you wherever you go .
she is very real to me .
you know , her eyes do follow you .
they' re made of glass , more' s the pity .
the exact size and color of the original .
they' re inserted into the sockets from inside ... by way of the hollow neck , before the head is attached to the body .
forgive me , my dear , for discussing your intimate secrets .
i' m sorry .
i lose myself at times .
if people knew what you have inside these walls ... you couldn' t accommodate the crowds .
what you need here is exploitation , more advertising .
that' s what i' ve been telling him .
my partner wouldn' t agree .
he' s not happy here .
he wants to invest in something else .
would you become a partner in this venture ?
would you buy him out ?
i might be interested if my lawyers approve and the price is right .
with your support , i' d do wonders .
i' d make any sacrifice .
unfortunately , i' m leaving for egypt .
i' m financing some excavations there .
i' il be back in three months , then we can discuss
you make me very happy .
you intrigue me , professor .
i believe we' d get along together .
good night .
good night .
and i' m grateful to you  it' s all right .
thank you for your visit and your encouragement .
i' il see you in three months .
good night .
good night .
mr. wallace is a great art critic , darling .
you heard what he said .
does he make you happy ?
of course you' d say that .
but i don' t care about success .
the world will acknowledge your beauty .
and you , my friends ...
cleopatra , mark antony , lincoln , joan of arc , all of you .
how would it suit you to be famous again ?
i know it' il please you , you conceited devil .
it was like you to get yourself shot down in a burning barn .
couldn' t do it without a spotlight , could you ?
do you really hear what they say ?
of course .
a man has to be a little nuts to be a good showman .
the sooner i' m out of it , the better .
you' il be out soon , matthew .
mr. wallace returns from egypt in three months .
he' il be ready to talk business then .
i heard him .
that' s no good for me .
but , surely
i want to buy something .
it' il pay off in a big way and three months is too late .
what guarantee do i have that he won' t go cold on the deal ?
sorry .
it' s the best i could do .
i can do better .
how would you like to split $25, 000 with me ?
and you call me crazy ?
you ever thought of what would happen if we had a fire here ?
in the cellar , there are six barrels of wax .
wax is paraffin based .
it' s highly inflammable .
this place would go up like a paint factory .
burn ?
burn all my people ?
do you think i' m a murderer ?
stop dreaming .
these dummies are insured for $25, 000 .
that' s $12, 500 for each of us .
you' d have money to begin again .
i' d rather die myself than see my friends destroyed .
i won' t let you do it , and i' il kill you if you try .
don' t be stupid .
all you have to do is to strike a match and the thing is done .
yes , my friend was a genius .
a great artist .
only i could understand him .
we were like that , cathy .
just like that .
couldn' t they ever find him after the fire ?
not a sign of him .
the place burned like a paint factory .
like a volcano .
he was such an impractical fellow .
but i still loved him .
had i been there , i might have saved him .
you might have gotten burned yourself .
yes .
such is life .
no matter how much we lose , we must still go on living .
was there any insurance on the wax museum ?
yes .
i had a little difficulty about that .
according to the partnership agreement ... the money was to go to the survivor of the others .
the insurance company insists upon proof of my partner' s death .
they always want a corpse .
but they settled finally .
this afternoon , in fact .
certified check .
i got it cashed .
the money is in my safe .
you know what that means , baby ?
no , what ?
that little trip i was talking to you about ....
you' re such a card !
how much did you get ? $25, 000 .
where would you like to go ?
atlantic city ?
niagara falls .
we can get the license in buffalo .
license ?
yes .
you know .
legitimate .
why not ?
it might be fun .
waiter , my check .
pull it tighter , sue .
i want a waist like anna held .
if i pull it any tighter , you' re not going to be able to breathe .
that' s all right .
i don' t need much breath , anyway .
if a girl don' t watch her figure , the men won' t .
wasn' t that the man you were to marry ?
yes , but he hung himself instead .
matty was such a card .
where is your new friend gonna take you tonight ?
the hoffman house for dinner , and then to a vaudeville show .
that sounds like fun .
he' s a free spender , all right .
little bit older than i like ' em , but very distinguished looking .
is he nice ?
awfully nice .
a real gentleman , except when he has had a couple of drinks .
that' s to be expected .
i' m moving up .
i' m moving up in the world , honey .
no girl ever hits the jackpot till after she passes 14th street .
is that how it goes ?
sure .
look at me .
not too long ago , i was down on delancey street .
and tonight i' il be right up there among the bright lights on 23rd .
now , when you get up there tonight , don' t drink too much .
don' t worry , i won' t .
he keeps trying to pour the liquor into me , but i always manage to keep my head .
after all , now that i' m going regular with a swell ...
i got social obligations .
you know how it is when a fella ....
no , of course you don' t know .
you' re not like me .
you never could be .
you got all the brains and all i' ve got is what i' ve got .
you know , i' m surprised you even talk to me .
what nonsense .
you' ve been so good to me .
why not ?
a girl needs a friend when she is down on her luck .
holy smoke !
look at the time .
i' ve got to hurry .
did you find a job yet ?
no , but they need a hat check girl at the silver slipper ... and i' ve got an appointment with the manager .
i know that fellow .
watch out for him .
but why ?
what' s the matter with him ?
nothing much .
long as you know how to duck .
that kind ?
yes .
did you eat today ?
i had everything i needed .
to hear you tell it .
besides , you' re behind in your room rent .
mrs. flannigan will wait for me .
don' t count on that .
the old buzzard almost locked me out once .
there .
if i don' t sizzle him tonight , i might as well give up .
he' s picking me up in a hansom cab .
no trolley for him .
he is real society .
all i' ve got is 50 cents .
buy some dinner with it .
no , cathy .
come on .
my friend will give me some money tonight and then i' il stake you .
i don' t need any mad money .
i never get mad .
good luck tonight at the silver slipper .
and don' t forget to duck .
just a moment , miss allen .
what are you coming in so quietly for ?
i didn' t want to disturb anybody .
did you get the job ?
no .
why not ?
i had trouble with the boss .
you' il get your money .
cathy promised to lend me some tonight when she comes home .
you better get right up there , then .
because she' s home now .
couldn' t it wait until tomorrow ?
no , it could not .
if you want to sleep in this house tonight , you get that money .
all right , i' il try .
cathy , it' s sue .
are you there ?
i tell you , the scream came from up there .
let' s look into it .
usually there' s a policeman at the corner .
that' s why i' m blowing the whistle .
cabbie !
what is it , mother ?
it' s sue .
this is a surprise .
i was just thinking about ....
what happened to you , dear ?
what' s wrong ?
wait a minute .
what happened ?
wait a minute .
what is it ?
cathy gray , the girl in my rooming house , was murdered tonight .
what ?
i found her .
the man who killed her was there in the room .
i tried to get away from him .
but he followed me into the street .
no , scott , please don' t go out there .
it' s all right , darling .
don' t be frightened .
it' s all right now , dear .
you' re safe .
who found the body ?
one of my roomers .
a friend of cathy' s .
sue allen .
which one is miss allen ?
she isn' t here .
where is she ?
i don' t know .
we heard her scream .
when we went looking for her , she was gone .
are all your roomers in ?
all but miss allen .
lt. brennan will want a statement from each one of you .
see that nobody leaves the house .
when i arrived at the rooming house , this girl had been dead for several hours .
the immediate cause of death was strangulation .
the mark of a cord is still on her throat .
my examination indicated she' d probably been given a drug .
you were right .
what was it ?
something to make her sleep .
veronal , perhaps .
i' il know as soon as we hear from the laboratory .
how long would it take for such a drug to work ?
that would depend upon how much it was diluted .
it was probably given to her in a drink .
that' s how it' s usually done .
business is slow tonight .
what ?
three suicides and two murders ....
and a traffic case since 9 : 00 .
the fellow got hit by an automobile .
i didn' t think they go fast enough to hurt anybody .
give them time .
they' re getting better every day .
i hope you like it here , honey .
it' s the best we' ve got .
what' s the matter with this one ?
you' il get used to that .
the embalming fluid makes them jump .
one of the suicides .
just like a woman .
they always have to have the last word .
why didn' t you tell the police ?
she' s doing that .
last night was the time to do it .
she was in no condition to come here .
this is murder , mrs. andrews .
the body of cathy gray was stolen from the morgue last night .
no .
why would anyone want to take cathy' s body ?
we are as much in the dark as you are .
we had a similar case before .
matthew burke .
i read about that .
and patterson , a deputy city attorney disappeared .
we found no trace of him .
we could' ve laid our hands on that man that you saw last night .
that' s the strangest description i' ve ever heard .
no human being can look like that .
sure you didn' t imagine it ?
i did see him .
just as i described him to you .
he was incredible , but very real .
could he be the man who took miss gray to dinner ?
that' s impossible .
she told me that he was very good looking .
that' s what the landlady said , it' s a man with gray hair .
we have no suspects fitting your description .
if we did , we' d have him in the crazy house .
don' t leave town .
where can we find you ?
27 lafayette street .
miss allen will stay in our home .
make sure of that .
she' s our only witness .
that' s all .
thank you .
how do you do ?
i received a letter giving this address and signed professor jarrod .
but i know the professor' s dead .
can you tell me who wrote this letter ?
my name is sidney wallace .
it' s so good ....
forgive me .
shaking hands with me is an unpleasant experience .
my hands are no longer hands .
sit down , please .
this is igor .
he' s a deaf mute .
he is one of my assistants .
i' m going to open another wax museum under a different name .
it startled you , seeing me here ?
i thought you were dead .
jarrod is dead .
i am a reincarnation .
when i saw your signature , i thought somebody was fooling me .
i don' t understand how you escaped the fire .
it' s a mystery to me , too .
all i can remember is that i tried to get out of my studio .
i failed at first , but here i am .
what a frightful experience .
somehow i made my way to the house of a doctor .
i still have my limbs but they won' t bear the weight of my body .
as for my hands , they are no use to me now .
as a sculptor , i can' t control them .
but they serve for ordinary functions .
but you' re beginning again ?
with the help of my pupils , yes .
i' m rebuilding my exhibition from the ground up .
i' m going to give the people what they want : sensation , horror , shock .
send them out in the streets to tell their friends ... how wonderful it is to be scared to death .
i' il show you one of my subjects .
do you recall the case of kemmler , the first man to die in the electric chair ?
yes .
igor is working on a model of his head .
he has a strange obsession , this mute of mine .
every head he models takes on the shape of his own face .
but in this case i humor him , for he somewhat resembles kemmler .
crimes of violence will be reproduced in wax ... and exhibited while they are still fresh in the public mind .
what do you think of my scheme ?
it will succeed , commercially , though it doesn' t sound like you .
have you turned your back on beauty ?
no .
but i can no longer create it .
i never forgot your marie antoinette .
nor have l .
she will be the leading lady of my new exhibition .
but i must find her first .
find her ?
a model , i mean .
yes , there will be beauty , for contrast , if nothing else .
but each subject must be taken from life .
how can i convince my audience they' re alive , if i don' t believe it myself ?
i have something i think will interest you .
you follow igor down into the basement .
i have to go my own way .
here we are .
interesting , isn' t it ?
one of my pupils is about to dip a body into a bath of wax .
body ?
yes .
the bodies are constructed separately ... to exact specifications , of reinforced plaster of paris .
this is leon , another one of my pupils .
mr. wallace .
how do you do ?
the wax is melted in the cauldron you see above the vat ...
liquefied and brought to a boiling point ... so that it will distribute itself evenly over the body .
the head and hands , tinted by my own secret process ... are attached to the body after it is covered with its skin of wax .
now watch .
i wondered how it was done .
it' s a method of my own .
crude but adequate .
have you found a home for your museum ?
this is it , the building upstairs .
we' il continue to use the cellar as the workshop ... it' s an excellent location , and the building can be leased at the right price .
i have some capital , but i need more . $30, 000 , at least .
that' s why i' ve asked you to come here .
i' il think it over .
good .
she is about right , now .
leon , drain out the surplus , and let her cool .
leon , open up number 27 .
come this way , please .
i told you that i intend to exhibit scenes of violence .
here is an interesting subject .
a mystery they are still talking about .
all right , leon .
i saw his picture in the papers .
this is a remarkable likeness .
but it can' t be a death mask .
no , it' s from memory .
he hanged himself in an elevator shaft .
come in , ladies and gentlemen .
see the house of wax .
see the chamber of horrors .
here' s three lovely ladies right over here .
would you like to see little egypt ?
here she is , ladies and gentlemen , little egypt , queen of the harem ... who danced at the colombian exposition in chicago in 1893 .
is she wax , or is she flesh and blood ?
see the world in wax , the hall of fame .
the chamber of horrors .
a cultural exhibition that' il enlighten you , amaze you ....
i think i could do that .
no , you couldn' t .
i could , too , if i took my stays off .
don' t do that .
don' t talk that way .
watch it , young lady .
careful , sir .
keep your head down or i' il tap you on the chin .
look out .
that' s a becoming hat you' re wearing .
i wonder if i could clip a flower off it .
hold steady , now .
don' t move your head .
or you' il lose the powder off your nose .
there is someone with a bag of popcorn .
close your mouth , it' s the bag i' m aiming at .
not your tonsil .
here she comes .
look at that , it' s in the bag .
see the lovely centers of ancient times , ladies and gentlemen .
beauties who died and tortured out on the block .
visit our chamber of horrors .
and pass the time of day with notorious murderers ... who killed with the rope , the knife , and the axe .
thrills , chills , a lot of dirt for a price within the reach of all .
i hope you don' t think i' ve gone too far hiring this fellow to bring people in .
he makes it sound like a sideshow .
try him for a week or two .
once we' re established , we won' t need that sort of thing .
he looks like a real man .
you' d be surprised .
it' s a real man .
sorry .
the historic figures i' m about to show you will be more interesting ... when i tell you that their faces were molded from the original death masks ... now in the possession of certain european governments .
first , we have anne boleyn ... second wife of henry the vill , and the mother of queen elizabeth .
with the executioner henry borrowed from the french king ... so that anne' s head would be cleaved from her body without too much pain .
he was a thoughtful husband , henry .
it was he who invented the short cut to divorce .
a very bad pun , i' m afraid .
here is another scene of historic violence .
charlotte corday and marat ... one of the leaders of the french revolution .
the lady found him taking a bath , and plunged the knife into his heart .
quelle femme terrible !
what a shocking thing .
yes , wasn' t it ?
the poor man was dreadfully embarrassed .
the exhibits in this room will be added to ... from time to time as various crimes are committed .
you' il read about them in your newspaper ... and see them enacted here in waxen tableaux .
by the way , ladies ... this is how your ancestor carried his bride across the threshold .
during the french revolution ... a certain doctor invented a labor saving device ... to take the place of a headmen' s ax .
so successful was this machine ... at cutting off the heads of the french aristocrats ... they named it after its creator .
here it is , the bloody guillotine .
i don' t think i can stand it .
pull yourself together .
twelve years ago , the electric chair was first used in new york state .
here we have an authentic reproduction ... of the execution of william kemmler on august 3 , in 1890 .
kemmler killed without mercy and 2, 000 volts sent him to a higher court .
the torture of the rack .
in this case ...
lady anne askew , an english noblewoman accused of treason ... is being put to the question .
needless to say , she admitted she was a traitor .
who wouldn' t , under that sort of pressure ?
is it your corset ?
it' s my stomach .
it turned over .
mine turned over , too .
now , my friends ... we have that jolly old gentleman known as the modern bluebeard .
like his namesake , he killed not wisely , but too well ... and did away with eight wives .
smelling salts , ladies ?
help yourself .
thank you very much .
next door to him , we have a mystery of more recent date .
matthew burke , the stockbroker .
he was found hanged in the elevator shaft of the building where he had his offices .
was it murder or suicide ?
only time will tell .
foul deeds will rise , though all the world o' erwhelm them , to men' s eyes .
thank you .
you like him ?
he looks exactly like my uncle rufus .
they ought to have a policeman like this in the eden muse .
haven' t you been there ?
no .
from what i see in the papers , this museum is even better .
we' il soon find out .
meet my good friend , mr. sidney wallace .
miss sue allen .
a pleasure .
i heard you were in town .
you should have looked me up .
i expect great things of scott .
he' s one of our most promising sculptors .
has he been working hard ?
he never knows when to stop .
sue' s been posing for me .
lndeed , lovely subject .
she' s not a professional model .
she' s a guest .
our mothers were great friends .
have you been inside ?
is it exciting ?
if anything , too much so .
but i' m sure it' il catch on .
jarrod , the owner , is a good friend of mine .
you' il be interested in him .
let' s go in , shall we ?
these figures are excellent .
i thought you' d agree with me .
they' re not only well done but they' re good theater .
what do you think ?
i know they are only wax ... but they seem so real , just looking at her makes my neck hurt .
wait till you see the chamber of horrors .
i told jarrod he should have a nurse on duty there .
he lost the use of his hands .
who did these figures ?
his pupils , but he supervised the work .
his is the mastermind .
surely knows his anatomy .
sue , what is it ?
are you crying ?
what' s wrong , miss allen ?
a dear friend of mine was murdered and i found her .
she means cathy gray , the girl whose body was stolen from the morgue .
what made you think of her now ?
that' s her face .
i know every line of it .
i wake up at night and i see it .
i can' t get it out of my mind .
perhaps that' s the reason you see a resemblance .
it' s more than a resemblance .
it' s wax , my dear .
i know , but ....
but why should it be so like cathy ?
i think i can explain that .
this is a pleasure .
you see , miss allen
i heard what the young lady said .
the figure of joan of arc is a traditional exhibit in wax museums .
it was completed just in time for our opening tonight .
you' re right , my dear .
it is more than a chance resemblance .
when i create an important figure , i can' t take just any face .
i saw pictures of your cathy gray in the newspaper .
her face fascinated me .
and here she is .
immortalized as the victim of an earlier event .
do you really think she' d mind ?
no , i don' t think she' d mind .
cathy loved to " dress up " as she called it .
she used to take fancy dresses ... and imitate the actresses she saw in the theater .
i don' t think she' d mind .
then i' m forgiven ?
there' s nothing to forgive .
i just don' t understand how it can seem so real .
that' s the finest compliment i have ever received .
thank you , my dear .
did i hear your name correctly , scott andrews ?
yes , mr. jarrod .
the sculptor i' ve been telling you about .
sidney showed me photographs of your work .
he was right .
you have great promise .
what are you doing now ?
i' m doing a head of miss allen .
let me see your hands .
mine were once like that .
how i envy you .
would you be interested in some modeling for me , some originals i have in mind ?
yes .
i' d be honored .
good .
come here tomorrow morning , we' il make the arrangements .
i think you' il like it .
i want you to look at this girl .
with pleasure .
who does she remind you of ?
i' ve been wondering about that .
i haven' t known her more than 10 minutes ... but there' s something about her face
that haunts you as the face of my marie antoinette has haunted me .
of course .
i should have seen it at once .
a figure in wax .
mr. jarrod' s greatest work .
more than wax .
she lived .
you mean i look like she did ?
exactly as she did .
once in his lifetime , every artist feels the hand of god ... and creates something that comes alive .
so it was with my marie antoinette .
and i loved her .
but she is gone now .
horribly destroyed .
perhaps you would help me to bring her back .
you will come to see me ?
soon ?
i' d be glad to .
you' il be welcome at any time , no matter what i' m doing .
and you , mr. andrews , in the morning ....
i' il be here , very eager to begin .
it has been a very exciting day for me and i' m a little tired .
so if you' il forgive me , i' il say good night .
sidney , one moment , please .
excuse me , i' il be right back .
forget about it .
you heard what mr. jarrod said .
cathy' s face was inspiration .
it' s a portrait in wax .
why should it seem so real ?
i hate to drag you away .
that' s fine .
i' m going to work here .
we' il see it all another time .
yes , another time .
still time to see the entire exhibition , ladies and gentlemen .
get your tickets from the fine little lady in the box office and go right in .
see the world in wax and improve your mind .
see the chamber of horrors and scare yourself out of a year' s growth .
not again .
what happened ?
why did you scream ?
i saw cathy again .
and the man who killed her was right here in this room .
i must have been dreaming .
of course you were , dear .
a lager for the gentleman .
sarsaparilla for the lady .
and two knockwurst on rye .
thank you .
enjoying yourself ?
it' s exciting .
do nice people come here ?
of course .
these sunday matinees are very popular .
i don' t know .
it doesn' t seem proper , all those girls showing their talents .
you never saw a show like this in provincetown ?
don' t worry , your reputation is safe .
you' ve been worrying too much ... about wax figures and seeing monsters in your dreams .
you need something like this to bring you back to normalcy .
prosit !
remember mr. jarrod said he first saw cathy' s picture in the newspaper .
yes .
what' s wrong with that ?
i knew her so well .
i knew every little expression and they are all there .
they would be .
the man' s an artist .
there' s something else i saw that night in the museum .
cathy had a habit of wearing an earring in her right ear .
she had the lobe of her right ear only pierced for that .
but that' s there , too .
how could he see that in a photograph ?
how can he make it so real unless ....
what ?
unless it is cathy .
i' m going to take you to lt. brennan' s office tomorrow .
tell him exactly what you told me here .
he' s a policeman , he knows .
he' il convince you once and for all that no such thing could happen .
now relax , honey , and enjoy the show .
i know it sounds fantastic , but you asked me to tell you everything .
you can see this idea is an obsession , an unhealthy one , if you ask me .
you say jarrod is a cripple ?
he uses a wheelchair .
he can walk with crutches , but not very well .
such a man came and asked to see police photographs of cathy gray .
that' s how it' s done .
every detail is studied to make the features true to life .
but why should joan of arc have her right ear pierced ?
why not ?
they wore them then .
two , not one .
lieutenant , it' s not a suspicion .
it' s more a kind of fear , an intuition .
intuition isn' t much help in police work .
facts are what we need .
suppose you forget about it , and let us do the worrying .
you mean you' il investigate it ?
of course he does .
yes , that' s what i mean .
you both think i' m crazy .
we think nothing of the kind .
it was very good of you to listen and be so patient .
thank you .
goodbye .
goodbye .
thanks .
this is brennan speaking .
give me shane .
hello .
i want you to go to the city license bureau ... and check up on a man named henry jarrod .
yes , he opened a museum on 29th street , near broadway .
yes , the house of wax .
dig up all you can .
get a list of his employees and check with me here .
that' s a copy of her face , all right .
but she didn' t look like that when i saw her .
not so composed .
poor kid .
you know , this fellow jarrod' s good .
you think miss allen' s fears are justified ?
heck , no .
do you ?
that' s wax , how could it be anything else ?
leave it to a skirt to dream up a crazy idea like that .
so you did you come to see me , my marie antoinette ?
or was it that you came to see ?
mr. jarrod , i' m so sorry .
i know i' m not supposed to touch the figures .
you couldn' t help yourself .
don' t let it trouble you .
i beg your pardon , this is leon averill and igor .
how do you do ?
igor isn' t impolite .
he simply can' t talk .
leon is an artist in his own right .
it was he who did the waxwork on the figure of joan of arc .
does she still seem real to you ?
as life itself .
of course , her hair is different , but that doesn' t change her face .
what puzzles me is how you can get such detail from a photo .
was cathy wearing her earrings when the police photographed her ?
earrings ?
i don' t remember .
was she , leon ?
no .
i don' t think so .
the police would remove the jewelry from the body , wouldn' t they ?
yet you were careful to show that both her ears had been pierced for them .
yes , of course .
if i missed a detail of that sort , mr. jarrod would be most displeased .
he insists on reality .
i can understand that .
just a moment , leon .
there' s something in this box i think would interest you .
open it , leon .
your mr. andrews permitted us to make a cast of the head he did of you .
leon has just finished it in wax .
do you like it ?
it' s sort of a shock to see your head detached that way .
i guess it' s a very good likeness .
yes , and no .
andrews is clever , but like all modern sculptors ... he has too much imagination .
he would improve on nature .
what i need for my marie antoinette is you .
the real you .
nothing less will satisfy me .
will you come to see me again , my dear ?
you know this fellow jarrod' s quicker at finding these guys than we are ?
that' s what he says in his advertising .
look at that .
even the twist in the neck .
that' s a case that gets me .
where is burke ?
who got him ?
who' d want him ?
we better find out pretty quick .
did you read the blast in today' s world ?
yeah , it' s dynamite .
the chief had me in his office this morning .
if i' m not careful , i' il be pounding a beat in the bronx .
come here , jim .
do you remember patterson , the deputy city attorney who disappeared ?
sure .
does booth look like wilbur , or am i crazy ?
he does a tad with the brush off his lip .
the hair is different , of course , but the features are like patterson' s .
maybe he looked like booth .
i' ve seen dummies that look like people i know .
the caveman is a spitting image of the new commissioner .
please .
don' t touch the exhibits .
can' t you read the sign ?
i' m sorry .
look , where' d you get the face for this guy that shot lincoln ?
from photographs .
they take them at that time ?
if you go to the city library ... you' il find the volume of mathew brady' s photos taken during the civil war .
do you work here ?
yeah .
you make these things ?
some of them .
what' s your name ?
leon averill .
what' s yours ?
jim shane .
i' m an engineer on the 9th avenue el .
it was nice meeting you .
you know me .
i' m no good at names , but i don' t forget faces .
if i can take the muff off of that one i might be able to place it .
it was a long time ago .
mr. wallace , i' m lt. brennan .
sgt. shane .
glad to know you .
won' t you sit down ?
sorry i kept you waiting .
that' s all right .
this is the first time i' ve been asked to come to police headquarters .
what am i suspected of ?
nothing .
we thought perhaps you might be able to help us .
we heard that your partner is the same professor jarrod ... whose museum on 24th street burned down some time ago .
that' s true .
this professor jarrod was supposed to have been killed in the fire .
apparently , a slight mistake .
you suspect him of some criminal act ?
we haven' t a thing on him .
we' re curious .
so is the insurance company .
what do you know about his employees ?
there' s scott andrews , a protg of mine .
yes , we know of him .
then there' s igor , deaf mute , and leon averill , who does the wax work .
averill' s an odd character .
periodical drunkard , but a fine artist .
i' ve seen some of his sketches .
one of the savior with his disciples .
beautiful work .
i' m afraid i haven' t been much help .
you never can tell .
thank you .
please don' t mention this to your partner .
i won' t .
you know , i gamble on jarrod .
he' s strange , unpredictable , but i think he' s a man of integrity .
i' m sure of it .
thank you very much .
not at all .
good day , gentlemen .
remember i told you i knew the man with the whiskers ?
do you remember that artist in sing sing who painted the last supper on his cell ?
hendricks .
they called him a genius and gave him a parole .
but when they turned him loose , he became a drunk .
he broke parole a year ago .
we' ve had him on the wanted list since .
carl hendricks ?
that' s him .
alias , leon averill .
bring him in .
can do .
a little more bitterness in that face , my boy .
remember , this fellow has been badly used by the world ... and he despises all the people in it .
deepen those lines around the corner of the mouth .
not too much .
there .
that' s better .
what i wouldn' t give to have those fingers of yours .
thank you , mr. jarrod .
i' m sorry i kept you so late tonight , scott .
that' s all right .
miss allen is meeting me here .
it' s her birthday .
we' re going to celebrate at chiles ' .
charming creature .
i was worried .
the shock of finding that murdered girl gave her strange ideas .
i know .
i took her to lt. brennan , he set her right .
that' s very good now .
excellent .
before you go , would you mind running over to metzgers for me ?
metzgers ?
where they make the artificial flowers .
they' re doing a background for this new group .
take a look at it .
you know what i want .
advise them on the color scheme .
i' d go myself , but it' s so hard for me to get about .
i know .
i' il be glad to do it .
i' il go right now .
thank you very much .
i followed him through his bender .
sometimes , he gets the shakes so bad , you expect to see his teeth fall off .
is this all he had on him ?
yes .
no money ?
gold .
to wilbur patterson ....
with affection and admiration .
city attorney' s office .
december 25 , 1900 .
where did you get this ?
i found it .
where ?
on the el .
what line ?
third avenue , downtown .
when ?
i don' t remember , it was months ago .
book him on suspicion of murder .
no .
i found that .
i never knew the man who owned it .
i never saw him .
lock him up .
please don' t put me in a cell .
i' m sick .
can' t you see my nerves are all shattered ?
look , please give me one little ....
can i have one little drink
you' re not going to get anything until you tell us where you got this watch .
take him out .
let' s go .
you shouldn' t have done that , my dear .
it is cathy .
it' s cathy' s body under the wax .
i knew it .
i knew it all the time .
everything i ever loved has been taken away from me .
not you , my marie antoinette , for i will give you eternal life .
this is where i recreated my joan of arc .
it' s an interesting process .
if you have patience with me , my dear , i' il show you how it' s done .
i can' t stand it .
all right .
all right , i' il tell you what i know .
patterson was killed because he looked like booth .
you killed him .
no , not l .
jarrod , at the waxworks .
his hands were no good .
he had to take subjects from life .
you helped him ?
no , they were already dead .
what about burke ?
he' s there , too .
in wax .
he was the one who set fire to the old museum .
jarrod came out of it alive , but insane .
cathy gray ?
joan of arc .
that' s cathy .
she' s there with all the rest of them .
the whole place is a morgue .
he' il do the same to sue allen , if he gets his hands on her .
you' ve got to stop him before he does any more killing .
that look of horror spoils your lovely face .
what if it should show , even through the wax ?
are you in there ?
where' s sue ?
where is she ?
the end will come quickly , my love .
there' s a pain beyond pain , an agony so intense ... it shocks the mind into instant oblivion .
we' il find immortality together ... for they' il remember me through you .
where' s jarrod ?
andrews , where' s jarrod ?
in the cellar .
he' s got sue .
take care of him .
the people' s exhibit number one .
you almost lost your head .
would you care to keep that one as a spare ?
no , thank you .
we' il never forget you and your men .
thanks to you , we' re still alive .
but every time i shave , i can still feel that guillotine blade .
please , let' s not talk about it anymore .
yes , you' re right .
mr. brennan , thank you for the use of your coat .
that was nothing .
it meant a lot to me .
when i found you weren' t dressed too warmly ...
i didn' t want you to catch a cold .
goodbye , mr. brennan , and thanks for everything .
bless you , mr. shane .
thank you , miss allen .
by the time this guy gets out of sing sing ... this head will grow a long beard .
