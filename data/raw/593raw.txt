i told you , it' s not ready !
a rice cooker !

it' s mrs chan' s .
my husband brought it from japan .
i wanted to show mrs koo how good it is .
now it' s ready !
mrs chan ...
could mr chan get me one next time ?
no problem !
mr chow , you should get one too !
your wife' s so often late home .
i couldn' t trouble mr chan .
it' s just neighborly , isn' t it ?
it' s no trouble !
i' il ask him to buy another next time .
thank you !
let' s try the rice .
mr chan , sorry to trouble you about the rice cooker .
it was really no trouble .
how much do i owe you ?
your wife has already paid me .
really ?
she didn' t tell you ?
she' s been working late shifts .
often i' m asleep when she gets back .
it must be hard for her .
yes .
mrs chan isn' t back yet ?
she' il be back soon ...
you need to talk to her ?
a friend needs to go to singapore .
i wonder if she could get a cheap ticket for him .
i' il ask when she gets back .
i' m bothering you too much .
don' t mention it , we' re neighbors !
i' il leave you in peace .
looking for me ?
damn right , where' ve you been ?
what' s up ?
mrs chan called , you left a hat at her office .
i meant to !
i wanted an excuse to go back .
i know your tricks !
she' s married .
i know , that' s why i left .
otherwise i' d move in next door .
if your wife wasn' t so attractive , she' d be a worried woman !
i' m not like you .
please call mrs chan for me .
i' il pick up the hat tomorrow .
and take her to lunch !
dream on !
she' il take the hat home .
i' il bring it in tomorrow .
you' re kidding !
some buddy you are !
tell you what , let' s go pick her up now !
she should be off work by now .
we can go together !
i don' t have time for this .
chow !
yes !
get out of here , i' m busy .
then i' il wait at your place .
ping !
mr chow , is mr koo in ?
he' s out ...
forgot to buy the paper again ?
that' s right , i' il stop by later .
maybe i can find it for you .
thank you .
this one ?
yes .
i always loved those serials , hated to miss an episode .
really ?
you liked them too ?
i even thought of writing one !
why didn' t you ?
i couldn' t get started , so i gave up .
i wasn' t born to write martial arts stories !
but you can borrow from my collection anytime .
not now , maybe another time .
thanks .
you' re welcome !
what is it ?
mrs chan !
i just want to return these to mr chow .
is he in ?
he' s been away for a few days .
why ?
they had a quarrel .
leave them with me , i' il pass them back to him .
thank you .
forget it !
i' m on a replacement shift tonight .
talk to you later .
no need to pick me up !
she' s already left .
really ?
i was going to take her out for supper .
didn' t she tell you she was off early today ?
she never remembers to tell me .
maybe she' s home by now .
i' il be off , then .
okay , bye !
hello !
you' re out of hospital !
don' t mention hospital !
lend me $30 !
what for ?
you gotta help me save face !
what' s the big deal ?
it' s ah hoi' s fault .
he gave me a racing tip , said it was a sure thing .
before they' d taken out the stitches ...
i bet everything i had .
and i lost my shirt !
what did you expect ?
i thought it was my lucky day .
anyhow , i had only $2 left .
so i went to the whorehouse .
you were in no shape for sex !
i thought it would improve my luck .
what would $2 buy you ?
i' m kwai fei' s regular , she gives me credit .
you can have it on credit ?
i left my id card and said i' d be back to redeem it .
i thought a few dollars would be easy to rustle up .
but so far nothing i' m way overdue .
so ?
four eyes was there yesterday .
saw her waving my id around in front of everyone .
so embarrassing !
anyway , lend me $30 !
this is all i can spare .
i need $1 0 for myself .
pay you back next month .
let' s have a late snack .
what ?
all i' ve had today is some won ton noodles .
let me finish writing this first .
i' m not sure i should tell you this ...
what ?
i saw your wife in the street yesterday .
so what ?
she was with some guy .
probably a friend .
just thought you should know .
miss yu ?
this is me .
mr ho' s still in a meeting .
he says he can' t manage dinner .
yes , we' re very busy now .
i will .
i' il ask mr ho to call .
have you called miss yu ?
yes , i have .
what did she say ?
asks you to call her later .
and mrs ho says she' s ready to cut her birthday cake .
she wants you to hurry home .
did you get me a present for her ?
yes , this .
what is it ?
a scarf .
i think mrs ho will like it .
thank you .
and here' s your change .
i' m always troubling you , use it for bus fare .
why don' t you dine with us tonight ?
thank you , i' ve already planned to see a film tonight .
then i won' t keep you .
tomorrow will be quiet , take the morning off .
are you going out tonight ?
don' t forget your keys .
all the neighbors are dining out tonight .
i have a lot to do here , i' il be late .
what is it , mrs chan ?
i heard voices ,
i thought mr and mrs koo were back .
not yet , anything i can help with ?
no , i just wanted a chat .
are you alone ?
yes , i am .
you' re back early today !
i came back to rest .
i' m not feeling well ...
what is it ?
i have some medicines ...
don' t trouble yourself , i' il sleep it off .
in that case , i' il leave you in peace .
it was your wife .
have you spoken to your wife yet ?
then we shouldn' t meet any more .
any news from the philippines ?
yes , a telex .
there' s a typhoon , so the ship' s still docked .
please inform chan that the shipment may be delayed .
ask if that' s a problem .
your wife rang .
you don' t need to pick her up .
she' s playing mahjong with mrs lau .
she' il meet you at the restaurant at 5 . 30 .
and there' s a gift from miss yu .
she was here ?
no , she had it sent over .
she says she' il dine alone since it' s your birthday .
please phone her when you have a moment .
i' il get you another coffee .
thank you .
thank you .
that tie looks good on you .
you noticed ?
it' s much like the old one .
you notice things if you pay attention .
i' il be off now .
if chan has a problem , let me know at the restaurant .
i will .
why did you change your tie ?
the new one was too showy .
i should stick with my own .
don' t forget to lock up .
by the way , haven' t seen your husband lately .
he' s abroad now , on company business .
that' s why i see you at the noodle stall .
i don' t like cooking for myself .
haven' t seen your wife lately either .
her mother' s ill , she' s at home with her .
that explains it .
good night !
good night !
mrs chan , i' m glad you' re back !
it' s raining so hard !
i was going to look for you with an umbrella .
you' re too kind .
amah , who is it ?
it' s mrs chan .
mrs suen !
caught in the rain ?
i said you could eat with us !
next time ...
enjoy your game .
her husband' s always away .
it' s sad to see her so lonely .
she dresses up like that to go out for noodles ?
mr chow !
what are you doing here ?
just calling mrs koo to the phone .
you' re late back .
i went to the pictures .
i' il be going .
hello ?
yes , please hold on .
who is it ?
it' s for mrs chan .
it must seem odd to ask you out , but i want to ask something .
that handbag i saw you with this evening ...
where did you buy it ?
why do you ask ?
it looked so elegant .
i want to get one for my wife .
mr chow , you' re so good to your wife !
not really !
my wife is so fussy .
her birthday is some days away .
i don' t know what to get her .
could you buy one for me to give her ?
maybe she wouldn' t want one just exactly the same .
you' re right , i didn' t think of that .
a woman would mind .
yes , especially since we' re neighbors .
do they come in other colors ?
i' d have to ask my husband .
why ?
he bought it for me on a business trip abroad .
they aren' t on sale here .
then never mind .
actually ...
i want to ask you something too .
what ?
where did you buy your tie ?
i don' t know where it came from .
my wife buys all my ties .
really ?
she bought this one on a business trip abroad .
it' s not on sale here .
what a coincidence !
yes .
actually ...
my husband has one just like it .
he said it was a gift from his boss .
so he wears it every day .
and my wife has a bag just like yours .
i know ,
i' ve seen it .
what are you getting at , actually ?
i thought i was the only one who knew .
i wonder how it began ...
it' s late ... won' t your wife complain ?
she' s used to it , she doesn' t care .
and your husband ?
he must be asleep by now .
shall we stay out tonight ?
my husband would never say that .
what would he say ?
anyhow , he wouldn' t say that .
someone must have made the first move .
who else could it be ?
it' s late ... won' t your wife complain ?
she' s used to it , she doesn' t care .
and your husband ?
he must be asleep by now .
i can' t say it .
i understand .
after all , it' s already happened .
it doesn' t matter who made the first move .
do you really know your wife ?
you order for me .
why ?
i' ve no idea what your wife likes .
what about your husband ?
like it hot ?
your wife likes hot dishes .
why did you call me at the office today ?
i had nothing to do .
i wanted to hear your voice .
you have my husband down pat .
he' s a real sweet talker .
why didn' t you call me today ?
i was afraid you won' t like it .
then don' t call me again .
mrs chan !
a letter from your husband .
it' s not for me , it' s for mr chow next door .
the japanese stamp made me think it was your husband .
so i was wrong .
your wife' s in japan ?
how did you know ?
what did she say in her letter ?
nothing special .
anything about when she' d be back ?
no .
what do you think they' re doing right now ?
are you alright ?
i' m fine .
please pull up here !
why ?
i' il get off first .
no , let me .
mrs chan !
ah ping !
you' re back ?
visiting mr chow ?
yes , i thought we' d have lunch .
but he isn' t well .
what' s wrong with him ?
he' s got a fever .
he' s all alone .
so i' m gonna buy him something to eat .
the congee downstairs is quite good .
he doesn' t want congee .
what does he want ?
can' t taste anything , so he wants sesame syrup .
damned troublesome !
amah !
mrs suen , she' s hanging the washing on the roof .
oh , you' re back .
yes .
you' ve been out ?
my mother' s birthday is coming up .
so i took her to buy some fabric .
it took all day , i' m half dead !
and i had my hair done ...
is it nice ?
very nice !
what are you cooking ?
i had a sudden craving for sesame syrup .
that whole pot is for you ?
i thought i might as well make a potful .
you' re so thoughtful !
please try it .
i will .
what a coincidence !
going out ?
i' il buy some noodles , i' m starving .
hungry ?
will you join me ?
no thanks .
just off work ?
you must be very busy .
actually , i' ve been to see a picture .
really ?
how was it ?
so so .
i used to like going to the pictures .
you had many hobbies before .
on your own , you are free to do lots of things .
everything changes when you marry .
it must be decided together ...
right ?
i sometimes wonder what i' d be if i hadn' t married .
have you ever thought of that ?
maybe happier !
i didn' t know married life would be so complicated !
when you' re single , you are only responsible to yourself .
once you' re married , doing well on your own is not enough .
don' t brood on it , maybe he' il be back soon .
what about you ?
actually , we' re in the same boat .
but i don' t brood on it .
it' s not my fault .
i can' t waste time wondering if i made mistakes .
life' s too short for that .
something must change .
so what' s your plan ?
i want to write a martial arts serial .
actually , i' ve started one .
i' il show it to you .
great !
you like them too , so why not help me write it ?
i wouldn' t know how , i only read them !
we could discuss it together .
alright , i' il try my best .
i never thanked you for the sesame syrup .
there' s no need , i was making it anyway .
amazing !
i was craving for some sesame syrup that day .
really ?
what a coincidence !
it really was !
i' il go for those noodles .
again !
halfway through dinner , he' s drunk !
disgusting !
i told you to stop !
what can you do ?
it' s me !
you scared me .
how' s mr koo ?
drunk , as usual .
i didn' t expect them back so early !
since you' re trapped here , finish the noodles .
they' il probably go soon .
want some soup ?
want some soup ?
mrs suen !
playing here tonight !
yes , mrs koo is dealing with her husband .
i could do that .
no , we should not trouble you .
think you' il play all night ?
no , we' il just play eight rounds .
they' il play till morning ?
mrs suen says only eight rounds .
you believe that ?
you get some rest , i' il wake you when they leave .
and you ?
i have a chapter to finish .
where have you got to ?
the drunken master just showed up .
when did he get written in ?
just now !
mr chow , home so early ?
i went out to buy some food .
no work today ?
i don' t feel so good , i' m staying home .
a sick man shouldn' t eat all that sticky rice .
some of it is for later .
don' t stuff yourself !
good morning !
good morning , finished your game ?
no yet , but mr yang has to work .
mr tsai is coming to replace him .
did you call the office for me ?
yes .
what did you tell them ?
that you weren' t feeling well .
did they ask who you were ?
no .
probably took me for your husband .
mr ho knows that he' s away .
pretend he' s come back .
maybe we' re being too cautious ?
i' m always round anyway .
we shouldn' t have panicked .
well , they did turn up without warning .
what would they assume ?
one can' t put a foot wrong .
you can go !
amah !
mrs chan !
you' re back very late !
i had a lot of work today .
i didn' t see you leave this morning .
i had breakfast with my mother .
you weren' t here when i left .
where' s mrs suen ?
asleep , she played mahjong all day .
be quiet , don' t wake her .
alright !
mrs chan , is your leg alright ?
it' s these new shoes .
why a special dinner tonight ?
since you won' t take your share of the writing fee ...
all i did was give you some thoughts .
someone else is asking for a serial too .
there' il be more work soon .
really ?
so quickly ?
isn' t the workload too much ?
that' s why i' m looking for a new place .
what for ?
to write in !
it' il be more convenient .
there' s nothing between us , but i don' t want gossip .
what do you think ?
why waste money ?
you don' t need me , you can write on your own .
who do you want ?
chow mo wan ?
he hasn' t been in for several days .
we' re looking for him too .
may i know who' s calling ?
any message ?
it' s no trouble , goodbye .
please get this to accounts .
and have the air conditioner serviced tomorrow .
mr ho !
no need to stay if everything' s done .
i' il lock up .
yes .
hello ?
where are you ?
i' il come again tomorrow .
no need , i' il be alright after some rest .
it' s no trouble .
i' il bring you some food ...
what would you like ?
whatever .
then i' il leave now .
get some rest .
call me when you get home .
let it ring three times , then hang up .
alright .
i didn' t think you' d come .
we won' t be like them .
see you tomorrow .
tell me honestly ...
do you have a mistress ?
you' re crazy !
who told you i had ?
never mind who .
do you or don' t you ?
no .
don' t lie !
look at me ...
i' m asking you , do you have a mistress ?
yes !
that' s no reaction !
if he admits it outright , let him have it !
i wasn' t expecting he would admit it so easily .
i didn' t know how to react !
one more time , alright ?
tell me frankly ...
do you have a mistress ?
you' re crazy !
who told you that ?
never mind that , do you or don' t you ?
no .
don' t lie !
tell me !
look at me , do you have a mistress ?
yes !
are you alright ?
i didn' t expect it to hurt so much .
this is just a rehearsal .
he won' t really admit it so readily .
it' s alright , don' t take it so hard .
you' ve been out a lot lately .
yes .
it' s right to enjoy yourself while you' re young .
but don' t overdo it .
when will your husband be back ?
soon !
in future , don' t let him travel so much .
a couple should spend time together .
don' t you agree ?
good night .
will you come over tonight ?
what for ?
the editor' s hounding me , he says i' m too slow .
i need your help , when can you come ?
not anytime soon .
why not ?
mrs suen lectured me last night .
what did she say ?
rather not say .
we shouldn' t see so much of each other .
mrs chan , going out for noodles again ?
not tonight , i' il make myself something .
join us , we' re having vegetable won tons !
alright .
no lunch today , mr ho ?
no .
a mr chow just called for you .
he wants you to call him back .
thank you .
back from work ?
yes .
strange weather !
isn' t it ?
been here long ?
just a while .
i don' t think it' il stop soon .
wait for me .
i' il see you home .
we' d better not be seen together .
then you go first .
if they see your umbrella , they' il know i was with you .
i wasn' t thinking .
you go first , i' il wait a while .
i' il keep you company .
did you try to call me ?
i wasn' t sure you got the message .
could you get me a boat ticket ?
to where ?
ah ping wrote from singapore .
they' re short of staff , he' d like me to go and help .
how long will you stay ?
don' t know , i' il play it by ear .
why rush off to singapore ?
a change of scene ...
i' ve had enough of the gossip .
we know it' s not true , so why worry ?
i used to think that too , and it didn' t worry me .
i thought we wouldn' t be like them .
but i was wrong .
you won' t leave your husband .
so i' d rather go away .
i didn' t think you' d fall in love with me .
i didn' t either .
i was only curious to know how it started .
now i know .
feelings can creep up just like that .
i thought i was in control .
but i hate to think of your husband coming home .
i wish he' d stay away !
i' m so bad !
will you do me one favor ?
what ?
i want to be prepared ...
you' d better not see me again .
is your husband back ?
yes ...
am i hopeless ?
not really .
i won' t see you again .
keep a closer eye on your husband .
please ...
don' t be serious , it' s only a rehearsal .
don' t cry !
this isn' t real ...
i don' t want to go home tonight .
mei yi wants to dedicate a song to her honeymooning friends .
and mrs cheung wishes the best to her neighbors .
and mr chan , now in business in japan , wants to wish his wife a happy birthday .
so let' s all enjoy zhou xuan singing in " full bloom " .
it' s me .
if there' s an extra ticket ... would you go with me ?
it' s me .
if there' s an extra ticket ... would you go with me ?
slngapore , 1963
mr chow has gone to work .
any message ?
you' re welcome !
has anyone been in my room ?
no .
something' s missing .
what ?
in the old days , if someone had a secret they didn' t want to share ...
you know what they did ?
have no idea .
they went up a mountain , found a tree ...
carved a hole in it ...
and whispered the secret into the hole .
then they covered it with mud .
and leave the secret there forever .
what a pain !
i' d just go to get laid .
not everyone' s like you !
i' m just an average guy , i don' t have secrets like you .
you bottle things up !
tell me something !
i don' t have secrets .
come off it , buddy !
i won' t tell anyone .
hello , singapore daily .
hold on .
mr chow , call for you .
thanks !
hello ?
hello ?
hong kong , 1 966
who is it ?
it' s me .
mrs chan , long time no see !
yes .
amah , who' s there ?
mrs suen !
what brings you here ?
it' s been a while .
i was nearby so i thought i' d bring your boat ticket .
and a small gift .
you shouldn' t have , it' s nice just to see you .
the place is in such a mess !
already started packing ?
it' s hopeless , i can' t bear to throw things away !
let' s find you a seat .
have some tea !
thank you !
eat with us , mrs chan !
i' m going to the market .
i can' t , i have work waiting .
don' t rush off !
mrs suen will be upset if you don' t eat here .
amah , pour me some tea too .
how' s your husband ?
he' s fine , thank you .
how long will you be away ?
i don' t know .
if i like it , i might stay !
why ?
my daughter worries about the situation in hong kong .
i don' t want to leave .
since the koos left , i don' t have my mahjong partners anymore .
and my daughter needs help with her kids in the us .
what about this place ?
i' m not sure ...
i don' t want to sell it .
so i might rent it out .
how much would you want ?
you' re interested ?
you could have it at a discount .
i' il think about it .
mrs suen , your tea !
who lives next door now ?
i don' t really know them .
the koos were almost like family !
it was so nice then , wasn' t it ?
yes .
let' s sit over here .
yes ?
is mr koo in ?
he moved long ago .
do you know where he is ?
you know him well ?
i used to live here .
is mrs suen still next door ?
she' s gone !
it' s too chaotic , everyone' s running away .
so who lives there now ?
a woman and her son .
the kid is cute .
no address in the philippines ...
just his son' s phone number .
i can' t accept this !
please , you must .
thank you , then .
that era has passed .
nothing that belonged to it exists any more .
are you ready ?
okay !
let' s go !
cambodla , 1966
the presidential corps waits at pochentong airport ...
prince norodom sihanouk and queen sisowath kossamak come forward to greet general de gaulle .
it' s ten kilometers from pochentong to phnom penh .
200, 000 people line the route .
a welcome unprecedented in the history of the kingdom .
he remembers those vanished years .
as though looking through a dusty window pane , the past is something he could see , but not touch .
and everything he sees is blurred and indistinct .
