i just want to dunk him in my coffee .

i don' t know .
there' s something about that one with the crazy hairdo that i find suspicious .
nonsense , maurice .
come on , everybody .
let' s go and meet the pansies !
presenting your royal highness , our illustrious king julien xill , self proclaimed lord of the lemurs , et cetera .
hooray , everybody .
he' s got style .
what is he , like , king of the guinea pigs ?
i think it' s a squirrel .
welcome , giant pansies .
please feel free to bask in my glow .
definitely a squirrel .
yep .
squirrel .
we thank you with enormous gratitude for chasing away the fossa .
the " whossa " ?
the fossa .
they annoy us by trespassing , interrupting our parties
and ripping our limbs off .
good .
we' re just trying to find out where the people are , so ...
what big teeth you have .
man !
shame on you , maurice .
can you not see that you have insulted the freak ?
you must tell me , who the heck are you ?
i' m alex .
the alex .
and this is gloria , marty and melman .
and just where are you giants from ?
we' re from new york and ...
all hail the new york giants !
new york giants !
ls this some sort of inbreeding program ?
i say we just got to ask these bozos where the people are .
excuse me .
we bozos have the people , of course .
hey , the bozos have the people .
oh , well , great .
good .
phew .
they' re up there .
don' t you love the people ?
not a very lively bunch , though .
wow .
so do you have any live people ?
no .
only dead ones .
i mean , if we had a lot of live people here , it wouldn' t be called the wild , would it ?
the wild ?
whoa .
hold up there a second , fuzzbucket .
you mean , like , the " live in a mud hut , wipe yourself with a leaf " type wild ?
who wipes ?
oy vey .
oy vey !
oy vey , everybody !
oy vey !
could you excuse me for a moment ?
get me out of here !
we got to get out of here !
help !
what are you doing ? !
i' m swimming back to new york .
i know my chances are slim , but i have to try !
you can' t swim !
i said my chances are slim !
nature !
it' s all over me !
get it off !
i can' t see !
i can' t see !
i can see !
look .
there' s obviously just been a little mistake .
the people didn' t dump us here on purpose .
as soon as they realize what happened , they' il come looking for us , right ?
yeah , right .
i don' t know the words but we' re born free
you know something ?
i bet they' re already on their way .
well , boys , it' s going to be ice cold sushi for breakfast .
rico .
well , since i' m doomed to die on this forsaken island ,
i , melman mankiewicz , being of sound mind and unsound body , have divided my estate equally among the three of you .
sorry , alex .
hey !
a latrine .
nice work , melman .
outdoor plumbing .
no , it' s not a latrine .
it' s a grave .
you sent melman to his grave .
are you happy ?
aw , come on .
this isn' t the end .
this is a whole new beginning .
this could be the best that' s happened .
no .
no .
no .
no .
no .
no .
no .
no .
no .
no .
this is not the best thing that' s happened to us .
you abused the power of the birthday wish and brought bad luck on all of us .
why' d you tell your wish ?
you' re not supposed to .
i didn' t want to tell you .
remember ?
you guys made me tell you .
oh , okay .
besides , this isn' t bad luck .
this is good luck .
look around .
there' s no fences , no schedules .
this place is beautiful .
baby , we were born ...
okay .
okay .
i' ve had enough of this .
this is your side of the island , and this is our side of the island .
that is the bad side , where you can prance and skip
like a magical pixie horse and do whatever the heck you want .
this is the good side for those who love new york and care about going home .
come on .
no , no .
back !
back !
you know what ?
this isn' t good .
okay !
you all have your side , and i' il have mine .
and if you need me , i' il be over here , on the fun side of the island , having a good old time .
this is the fun side , where we' il have a great time surviving until we go home .
a yabbadabbado old time !
this side' s the best .
that side stinks !
you' re on the jersey side of this cesspool !
wilma !
now what do we do ?
don' t worry .
i have a plan to get us rescued .
can' t wait to see the look on marty' s face when he sees this .
just look at him .
he' s helpless without us .
shut up , spalding .
i' ve been standing here for hours , man .
how long do i have to pose like this ?
she is finito .
i defy any rescue boat within a million miles to miss this baby .
when the moment is right , we will ignite the beacon of liberty and be rescued from this awful nightmare !
what do you think ?
pretty cool , huh ?
how' s the liberty fire going , melman ?
great . ldiot .
i heard that .
why can' t we just borrow some of marty' s fire ?
that' s wild fire .
we' re not using wild fire on lady liberty .
now , rub , melman .
i' ve been doing ...
i can' t .
i can' t .
i can' t do it .
i ju ...
i can' t do it !
fire .
fire .
fire !
fire !
oh , my
fire !
not yet !
no , no !
no !
fire !
melman , hold still !
jump !
alex , jump !
don' t worry , cats always land on their ...
face ?
man , what kind of cat are you ?
you maniac !
you burned it up !
darn you !
darn you all to heck !
can we go to the fun side now ?
everybody , calm down .
come on . lnto your chairs .
everybody , calm down .
let go of his tail .
separate those two , would you , please ?
you here , you there .
everyone ...
calm down , people , okay ?
now , presenting your royal highness , the illustrious blah , blah , blah .
you know , et cetera , et cetera .
hooray .
let' s go .
now , everybody , we all have great curiosity about our guests , the new york giants .
yes , willie ?
i like them .
i like them .
i liked them first .
before i even met them i liked them .
i liked them right away .
you hate them compared to how much i like them .
oh , shut up .
you' re so annoying !
now , for as long as we can remember , we have been attacked and eaten by the dreaded fossa .
the fossa !
the fossa are attacking !
it' s a cookbook !
it' s a cookbook !
please .
maurice .
quiet !
come on , y' all .
they' re not attacking us this very instant .
we will make the new york giants our friends and keep them close .
then , with mr. alex protecting us , we will be safe and never have to worry about the dreaded fossa ever again .
i thought of that .
i thought of that .
yes .
me .
i did .
hold on , everybody .
hold on .
i' m just thinking now .
i mean , does anyone wonder why the fossa were so scared of mr. alex ?
i mean , maybe we should be scared too .
what if mr. alex is even worse than the fossa ?
i tell you , that dude just gives me the heebiedabajeebies .
maurice , you did not raise your hand .
therefore , your heinous comment will be stricken from the record .
does anyone else have the heebie jeebies ?
no ?
good .
so shut up .
when the new york giants wake up , we will make sure that they wake up in paradise .
now , who would like a cookie ?
yo , al .
melman and gloria are over there having a good time .
there' s room on the fun side for one more .
no , thanks .
look , i' ve been thinking .
maybe if you gave this place a chance ,
i don' t know , you might even enjoy yourself .
marty , i' m tired .
i' m hungry .
i just want to go home .
could you just give it a chance ?
think about it .
it really isn' t the fun side without you .
i know .
and then ...
it' s him .
who is it ?
it' s the pizza man .
who the heck do you think it is ?
yes ?
can i help you ?
can i come to the fun side ?
beg your pardon ?
you know , i' ve been kind of a jerk .
but i' ve been thinking about what you said , and i' m sorry .
welcome to casa del wild .
take a load off .
hey , hey , wipe your feet .
alex !
mi casa is su casa .
very impressive .
hey , have a drink .
it' s on the house .
this is seawater .
oh , you don' t swallow it .
it' s just temporary till the plumbing' s done .
hey , y' all look hungry .
how would you like some of nature' s goodness ?
you have food ?
the fun side special , coming up .
seaweed on a stick .
seaweed ?
on a stick .
don' t love it till you try it .
that' s unbelievable .
so good .
well , thanks .
it does kind of hit the spot , doesn' t it ?
well , maybe it could use a little lemon .
no , it' s great .
it' s really great .
doesn' t get any better than this .
oh , but it does .
check this out .
wow .
would you look at that .
it' s like billions and billions of helicopters .
it' s a shooting star .
make a wish .
quick !
ooh !
how about a thick , juicy steak ?
you know what , alex ?
i promise you i' m going to find you a steak tomorrow if it kills me .
thanks , marty .
it is getting late .
i guess i' m going to ...
i think i' m going to hit the sack too .
sweet dreams , everyone .
alex .
what are you doing ?
twenty seven , 28 , 29 .
thirty black and only 29 white .
looks like you' re black with white stripes after all .
dilemma solved .
good night .
you see , maurice , mr. alex was grooming his friend .
he is clearly a tender , loving thing .
how can you have the heebie jeebies for mr. alex ?
look at him .
he' s so cute and plushy .
i don' t think he was grooming him .
look more like he was tasting him to me .
suit yourself , no matter .
i don' t care .
soon we will put my excellent plan to action .
all we have to do is wait until they are deep in their sleep .
how long is this going to take ? !
well , this sucks !
wake up , mr. alex .
wake up , mr. alex .
rise and shining .
wakey waking , mr. alex !
wake up !
alex !
you suck your thumb ?
where are we ?
what the heck is going on ?
where' s the beach ?
take it easy .
who built a forest ?
don' t be alarmed , giant freaks .
while you were asleep , we simply took you to our little corner of heaven .
welcome to madagascar .
mada who ah ?
what ?
no , not whooha .
ascar .
marty .
it' s ...
just like my mural back at the zoo .
oh , no , fella , that is the real deal right there .
look at that , that' s not a bad view .
that' s the thing that you were always looking at , but it' s actually there .
that' s the real version of ...
how about once around the park ?
let' s get our blood pumping , lungs breathing this fresh air .
who' s with me ? !
naw .
i don' t think i could ...
you' re it !
hey !

hey , stop that !
hey , you' re crazy !
okay , marty , i' m it .
i' m it .
i' m it .
you win .
come on , alex , get in the groove .
i haven' t eaten in two days .
my blood sugar' s real low .
i just don' t have the energy .
i don' t think that' s your problem .
first of all , that' s not how you run in the wild .
let' s go .
put the rubber to the road !
you just have to let out that inner lion .
now , who' s the cat ?
marty , i really don' t ...

come on !
here we go !
that' s it .
let' s build up some steam !

noogie , noogie , noogie .

like you said , baby , it' s ...
crackalacking .
ain' t that right , melman ?
oh , yeah .
oh , yeah .
i' m in heaven .
you see , maurice , alex is now our friend and the fossas are nowhere to be seen .
it could be said that my plan is working in a very good working kind of way .
alex .
you got to try some of this .
i feel good .
feel like a king again .
king ?
you should see his act .
come on , alex , why don' t you show him some of your act .
oh .
no , i really don' t think i could ...
okay .
ladies and gentlemen .
primates of all ages .
the king .
alex the lion !
e flat , fellas .
yeah !
the king is in the house !

i' ve got a crown .

that' s dumb .
come , come , maurice .
what is a simple bite on the buttocks among friends ?
here , give me a nibble .
the party is over , julien .
your brilliant plan has failed .
what are you talking about ?
your friend here is what we call a deluxe model hunting and eating machine .
and he eats steak ... ... which is you .
get out of here .
okey dokey , maurice , i admit it .
the plan failed .
all is lost !
we' re all doomed .
the fossas will come back and gobble us with their mouths because ... ... we are all steak .
i' m steak !
me , me , me !
mr. alex cannot stay here .
he belongs with his own kind on the fossa side of the island .
by the power vested in me , by the law of the jungle , blah , blah , blah , blah ...
be gone !
what ?
come on , do i look like a steak to you ?
yeah !
see , i told you i don' t look like a ...
wait .

oh , yeah !
he' s going savage .
run for your lives .

oh , no .
what have i done ?
it' s true .
i' m a monster .
i got to get out of here .
what have i done ?
this is a nightmare .
and it' s all my fault .
now , because of me , we' ve lost alex .
well , what are we going to do ?
we' il find a way to help him .
that' s what we' il do .
okay .
come on , we are new yorkers , right ?
we' re tough .
