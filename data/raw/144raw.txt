ditomasso is in the adjacent structure .
captain steele and about 40 men , rangers , are here , a couple blocks away .
they' re banged up pretty bad .
he set up a casualty collection point , i don' t think they' il be able to move .
sergeant sanderson and a small delta team ... ... are moving from steele' s position to the crash site as we speak .

a crowd is advancing six , seven blocks from the crash .
shughart and gordon again requestpermission ... ... to secure until convoy arrives .
over .

from where they are , they can see things clearer than any of us .
they know what they' re asking .
let me talk to them .
this is garrison .
i want to make sure thatyou understand whatyou' re asking , so say it outloud .
we' re asking to go in and set up a perimeter until ground support arrives .

we need to come back to base , rearm and regroup and then we can go back out .

we' re going home !
let' s go .

what' s up ?
they' re sending them back .
the convoy' s headed back to base camp .
oh , now that makes sense , don' t it ?
we need to exfil the wounded now and get out of here before it' s too late !
if colonel mcknight went back to base , then he had a good reason .
it changes nothing .
all right , listen up .
we' re going to hold the perimeter and we' re going to hold the strongpoint .
conserve your ammo .
only shoot at what you can hit .
the convoy is going to come .
we' re going to get home .

lieutenant colonel cribbs for you , sir .
cribbs ?
they' re still debating the route .

at least a couple of hours .
we haven' t got that long , joe .
pakistani general says , since we didn' t deign to inform him of the raid ... ... it' il take some time to mobilize the 10th mountain and 100 vehicles .
i understand , but it is my duty to remind him ... ... that my men are surrounded by thousands of armed somali militia .
it' s imperative that we move them out of the hostile area and into the safe zone .
i need his help now .
yes , sir .
durant .
michael durant .
yes .
you are the ranger who kills my people ?
i' m not a ranger .
i' m a pilot .
that' s right .
none of you americans smoke anymore .
you all live long , dull , uninteresting lives .
what do you want with me ?
you have taken hostages .
we have you .
my government will never negotiate for me .
then perhaps you and i can negotiate , huh ?
soldier to soldier .
i' m not in charge .
course not .
you have the power to kill , but not negotiate .
in somalia , killing is negotiation .
do you really think if you get general aidid ... ... we will simply put down our weapons ... ... and adopt american democracy ?
that the killing will stop ?
without victory , there can be no peace .
there will always be killing , you see ?
this is how things are in our world .
mike durant , we won' tleave you behind .
mike durant , we won' tleave you behind .
you got to take over from me .
both hands .
it' s the femoral artery , but i can' t see it .
which means that it' s retracted up into the pelvis .
i have to find it and clamp it .
it' s the only way to stop the bleeding .
i got no more ivs .
so , i' m going to need you to assist .
okay ?
yeah , yeah .
now listen , jamie .
i got to do something , it' s going to hurt .
i got to cause you more pain , but i have to do it to help you .
all right , you understand ?

it' il lower your heart rate too far .
i' m sorry .
twombly , why don' t you take his hands ?

they should' ve sent a medivac .

more men would get torn up .
maybe .
see , you' re thinking .
don' t .
because , sergeant , you can' t control who gets hit or who doesn' t .
who falls out of a chopper or why .
it ain' t up to you .
it' s just war .
yeah , well , smith' s still dead .
this all happened because blackburn fell .
should have , could have , don' t matter .
you' il get plenty of time to think about all that later .
believe me .
sergeant , you got your men this far .

you need to start thinking about getting these men out of here .

they won' t understand it' s about the men next to you .
and that' s it .
that' s all it is .
don' t even think about it , all right ?
i' m better on my own .
we started a whole new week .
it' s monday .
i was talking to blackburn the other day ... ... and he asked me , " what changed ?
why are we going home ?
and i said , " nothing .
but that' s not true , you know .
i think everything' s changed .
i know i' ve changed .
a friend of mine asked me before i got here ....
it was when we were all shipping out .
why are you going to fight somebody else' s war ?
what , do y' all think you' re heroes ?
i didn' t know what to say at the time ... ... but if he asked me again , i' d say no .
i' d say there' s no way in hell .
nobody asks to be a hero .
it just sometimes turns out that way .
i' il talk to your ma and pa when i get home , okay ?
my love , you are strong and you will do well in life .
i love you and my children deeply .
today and tomorrow , let each day grow and grow .
keep smiling and never give up , even when things get you down .
so , in closing , my love ... ... tonight , tuck my children in bed warmly .
tell them i love them .
then hug them for me ... ... and give them both a kiss good night for daddy
