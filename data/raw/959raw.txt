let' s go .
shut up .
i still can' t believe it .
bam just walks in and greg tosses him a handful of his decks .
i can' t wait to get my own deck .
i did the math .
there' s 53 guys who make a living skating and about a million wannabes like us .
and ?
and nothing .
but until a sponsor backs a tour bus into my driveway ... ... l have to work all summer to pay for school .
i don' t believe you .
you' re still gonna bail on me .
you know what ?
matt listened to your crap , and look where that got him .
the guy is a complete stain .
matt deceives you .
i don' t
he does because he , in actuality , really knows which end is up .
what' s up , man ?
so dustin' s bailing on us again .
really ?
i' m gonna alert the press , man .
dustin' s always bailing .
i' il always skate .
i just won' t be homeless with you .
you say that , but i know you mean something else .
before you know it , you' il be a fat , middle aged male with a nice beer gut ... ... divorced about 20 times , wishing you were skating again .
dudes .
get the moron out of the pool .
matt .
when is the moron gonna release his death grip on our premises ?
have you smelled it lately ?
it' s like an open sewer .
good to see you too , pops .
we need to talk about your future .
yeah , you know , i' d love to , but we' re heading out to this ....
sugarplum .
i hate when he calls me that .
listen , remember our deal .
dad , l  don' t " dad " me .
we had a deal .
you' re either in school , or you' re at rivers hardware working next to your old man .
sniffing a little of that lacquer while you' re mixing the paint .
come on !
obvious perks there .
it' s a good living .
it' s a good future .
it' s a good life .
i' il tell you that much .

i' d like what i ordered .
sorry , sir .
hello ?
i didn' t get that , sir .
could you ?
could you repeat that ?
open your ears , jackass !
yeah , i see that you already ate the gut bomb , though .
yeah , but i can' t help it that i didn' t figure it out until i' d swallowed it all .
you really think you need another ?
what ?
mr. knight , let me handle this .
sir , our policy clearly states every customer will be served to his satisfaction .
customer may receive a replacement excuse me , i' il be right with you .
a replacement will be given as long as he has a receipt .
you have one ?
all right , that' s good .
give him one of these .
you' re late , eric .
you' re just a little bit late .
and late is not great .
do you wanna go to the restroom before i reload you ?
you want me to call the grownup back ?
you' re probably leaking beans .
one big scoop .
that' s two , but two is enough .
two is plenty .
now , let' s go over here and do the cheddar .
two scoops of cheddar , one scoop of onion .
that' s very good , son .
you know , eric , you' ve got great potential .
just go to it .
you go to it , deputy .

two hours till the demo .
let' s get this place cleaned up and get out .
i can' t .
i need the overtime .
oh , boy !

someone really abused the men' s room .
it' s like a doody bomb exploded .
was he a tall guy with glasses maybe ?
just a hunch .

no , i don' t .
show a little team spirit .
go in there and make it sparkle .
here you go .
it' il be my pleasure .
thank you , sir .
hey , listen .

i' m a professional skater , baby .
yeah , right .
i' m telling you the truth .
i' m not skating today , because i thrashed my arm .

you think it' s more like pepperoni or ass crack ?
i got 5 bucks on pepperoni .
you' re so gross , man .

i represent the release the twins foundation .
you guys wanna make a little donation ?
what are you talking about ?
about releasing those twins .
they look uncomfortable in their little cages .
come out !
it' s no wonder why you can' t get a date .
it was working .
i' m in a dry spell , man .
to be in a dry spell ...
... you' ve had to have been in a wet spell .
i' ve had sex .
yeah , with a human , though .
who' s making these rules , man ?
product toss .
i love it when these little freaks tear each other' s skin off for a sticker .
what is he doing ?
i had to skin a 9 year old for that , man .
you needed a board .

that' s a big " no " on jimmy .
good .
thank you .
what are you looking at , pinhead ?
no .
what' s up ?
actually , we' re here to see jimmy .
he told me to drop this tape by for him .
i think he wants to sponsor us .
that' s cool .
i' m stoked .
that' s great , guys .
hang on just a minute .
all right .
let' s see .
cool .
there you go .
yeah .
this is just today' s haul .
excuse me , that' s all from today ?
yeah .
" sponsor me . " two very popular words .
how does he have time to watch all those ?
well , he' s worked out this technique where he doesn' t watch any of them .
it' s working out really well for him .
yeah .
should i bounce these nerds out of here ?
no , they' re cool .
you guys are cool , right ?
yeah , we' re straight .
i' m cool .
it' s okay .
all right .
so i' m here to help you .
i don' t want you to get in trouble .
because the truth is , jimmy did want us to come by and say what' s up , you know ?
and if you could just get us in for two minutes ....
i can do that .
you can do that .
but i' m not going to do that , because i don' t want to .
and i just can' t seem to find my way around that .
i' m sorry .
i really wish you guys all the best in the world , sincerely .
you know , but you know , hey .

the whole thing sort of sounds sketchy .
i' m sorry .
i never heard of this super duper skates .
yeah , i know .
that' s because i just made it up .
wake up and smell the desperation .
we needed a company name to give us credibility on tour .
on tour ?

we' re hitting the road as a team .
we skate better than half of those guys .
yeah , i can .
it' s weird .
there you go .
jimmy' s a man , right ?
once we' re on the road , we follow him around .
we get in front of him one time , he' il see we' re the real deal .
that does sound super duper .
but i really don' t i mean , i' m just saying , if you think about it
no , it' s cool .
it' s cool .
you two can sit here and touch yourselves ... ... for the rest of your lives , or you can try getting off your asses and making it happen .
that' s about a nine on the richter scale , man .
i think he' s saying we got a nest egg here , and we' re extraordinarily comfortable .

at least there' s no way in hell that this could get any worse .
ln the name of all things holy .
are you kidding me , man ?
i' m sorry .

and with that money , i happened to buy a little food for myself ?
it' s bread .

god , stop !
damn it !
at least she left our stuff .

we' re gonna die out here .
we have no food and no car .
seriously , anyone , what are we gonna do ?
i thought she was a sweet girl .
that' s her ass you' re thinking about , not her depraved criminal mind .
wham , bam , steal the van .
we just need something .
some kind of sign to tell us to keep going .
do we ?
i' m sure we' re gonna get a sign .
look , jimmy wilson is coming over the hill right now to give us a big deal .
there he is .
look , there' s his bus , and he' s got a scholarship for me .
oh , no , wait .
that' s a mirage because we' re in the middle of the desert !
tucson , that' s where we' re headed ?
yeah .
that' s good .
no one' s food here !
i just had the wildest dream , man .
what are you doing ?

bam !

what' s up ?
what' s going on ?
remember me from ... ?
the skate shop , right ?
skate shop .
exactly .
he' s with me .
i' m with him .
so how' s everything going ?
yeah , really good .
so this is crazy , huh ?
yeah , it is pretty insane .
i know your schedule and everything like that has gotta be pretty nuts ... ... but if you have five minutes , could you just check this out ?
it' s a tape we put together .
could you pass it on to jimmy ?
i got so much shit on my plate , the last thing i need now ... ... is looking at some random " sponsor me " tape .
sorry about that .
that' s cool .
i figured i' d give it a shot .
give me the tape .
of course i' il watch it .
i' m not that big of a dick .
thanks .
that' s great .
cool .
you talking shit about me ?
jamie , do you really wanna do this now ?
have the balls to say it to my face .
okay , i' m saying it to your face .
i don' t want you here .
okay ?
the last thing i need on this tour ... ... is some haggard ass chick lurking around .
just take it easy , man .
what ?
you serious ?
yeah , relax .
i mean , she doesn' t need you insulting her .
lf you wanted me to watch your tape , you pretty much ruined that .
so ....
thanks .
hey , so , that was pretty harsh , huh ?
i think i can take care of myself .
no , i figured that .
i mean , i can tell , but ....
you know , everybody could use a little backup once in a while .
wanna get out of here ?
you serious ?
i don' t think anybody is home .
let' s just get in and out real fast , okay ?
hello ?
anybody home ?
hey , matt , don' t touch anything , okay ?
mirrored ceilings .
we got this place to ourselves , man .
oh , black leather .
that' s just how snoop would do it .
oh , come on .
good .
hey , ladies ... ... l' m jimmy wilson .
tonight you' re gonna be my love slaves .
there it is .
stop it for five seconds .
all right , jimbo , just gonna bust a little switcheroo .
you hit play , you' re gonna enjoy the super duper team demo .
i' ve been holding it for two days .
it' s about to go downtown .
good idea .
take a crap on his bus .
he would appreciate that .
i got it .
let' s go .
all right , dude , let' s go .
i did it .
let' s go .
dude .
i might not get a piece of jimmy wilson , but he got a piece of me .
that smells like hermit craps .
that was amazing , jimmy !
i' ve been waiting two years to pull that trick .
we got it on footage , check it out .
let' s see it .
oh , no .
what the hell ?
tell me that' s not your only copy of the tape .
somebody broke the tour rule .
i' il fix this .
let' s get out of here .
who did number two on the bus , man ?
how many times do i have to tell them ?
no going number two on my bus !
so basically ... ... we' ve been following the jimmy wilson tour all over the country .
that' s insane .
yeah .
it sucks .
i had this whole thing planned out .
all we had to do , get in front of him , and it was so easy .
he just had to see us skate , and he' d pick us up .
but ... ... of course , we found a way to screw everything up ... ... and the whole thing has turned into a disaster .
you can' t argue with talent .
so ... ... just keep skating , and someone will find you .
i know about these things .
you must .
i guess , by the way things went down , you guys have been hooking up for a while .
you think i' m into bam because he' s on tour ?
i don' t know .
i thought that' s how things went around here .
everyone hung out with the pros and did their thing .
tour slut at your service .
no !
i didn' t i really didn' t mean it like that .
i ....
it' s just , you know , you' re super cute .
i' d throw myself under the wheels of jimmy' s bus ... ... to get a chance to be with a girl like you .
you' re sick !
you' re sick !
that' s sick !
i know you .
we got on jimmy wilson' s bus , and matt took a big crap on it .
i don' t know if it was the stroganoff or what , but i was like
stop .
wonderful .
these are my friends by default and not by choice , and we' re leaving right now .
all right .
see you .
bye , friends .
sometimes eric looks like he man .
so , what' s up ?
let' s go .
excuse me , sorry .
i got a code brown to wrestle down to the ground .
oh , my god !
there she is , boys .
what do we do now , man ?
i don' t know , dude .
look at this guy .
ls this guy gonna stop ?

come on , come on !
go , go , go , go , go !
come on !

hey , you all right ?
they didn' t see it .
but i sure did .
i' m sick and tired of you punks thinking you can skate wherever the hell you feel like .
sir , we' re at a skate demo .
smart ass .
you know , i could have you guys arrested .
come here .
but for once , i' m gonna have you skaters take care of your own mess .
sweet lou cleans no man' s poop .
have fun , girls .
so to recap ... ... we smell like turds , we have no car , no jimmy wilson ... ... and i' m broke .
call me stupid .
hey , stupid .
what ?
don' t worry about it , man .
this is the part where eric rivers jumps up ... ... and angels descend from heaven , sustaining one long note ...
... and he says , " team meeting .
does he have a plan ?
i bet he does .
this is our last shot .
it' s over .
what ?
wait , he' s giving up ?
what the hell else you want me to do ?
i' m fricking one step away from being somebody' s stalker .
you guys should have just stayed home , not listened to a word i said .
my fault .
let' s get one thing straight here .
i followed you here because you got balls .
and because sandy' s dad was about to rip mine off , but ....
seriously . lf it wasn' t for you , we' d still be at home .
i' d still be on your couch .
don' t push me !
hey , man , i' m trying to tell you we' re having fun , bro .
for real , man .
we' re on an adventure .
no .
no , we' re on a train wreck .
this is a revolving nightmare .
no , a revolving nightmare is us still in chicago ... ... not trying to do anything with our lives .
let me tell you something .
the $ 736 . 1 8 i' ve spent since i' ve been here ... ... worth it .
you have that down to an exact ?
yes , worth it .
every penny .
look at us , man .
we' re not losers anymore , man .
we' re a team .
we' re super duper .
fucking assholes .
come on , don' t be sad .
hey !
hey , what' s going on ?
you might want to stand back about 40 feet .
yeah , look , i' m a little ripe right now .
so listen , are you guys going up to santa monica ?
no , we weren' t going to .
what' s going on there ?
it' s the pro jam . lf you' re pro or sponsored , you can skate .

ln the name of all things holy , please .
you feel this vibe ?
you feel the pulse ?
how we' re all sharing one heartbeat , like a herd of elk ?
we finally accumulated something of a team vibe over there .
do not ruin it .
you don' t wanna bring a girl ?
no , man !
where' s the van , dude ?
they' re all cute , and ... ... the horns come out .
