why else would i ask you here ?
then i can be honest .
i have a bad feeling about this .
daddy will stop the wedding ?
how would he find out ?
why does daddy dislike him ?
but i' m marrying him anyway .
forget about your father .
where' s your groom ?
we spoke on the phone three nights ago .
he asked if i liked his gift .
he has to fix up our new home in hong kong .
before a big event like this .
you haven' t called him in days ?
but i did .
i only reached his voicemail .
voicemail ?
relax , he set the wedding up .
maybe his fight is late .
macy , i checked with the airline .
his flight arrived 4 hours ago .
maybe he took another flight .
i' ve checked with all airlines .
maybe he got sick of flying .
the chapel can' t wait any more .
so ?
cancel it then .
thank you .
hello !

wedding ?
today ?

i received my final payment cheque . $2, 837, 695
your beau signed it .
that' s weird .
it bounced like mad .

time to pay up .
no more tricks .
maybe you' re conning me .
you two make a great couple .
one vanished , the other ...
leave me alone .
air ticket !
honeymoon ?
but you won' t pay up .
so irresponsible !
what ?
you' re so damn selfish .
lucky you' re not a man .
or ?
with one punch i' il knock you down .
then a kick to send you flying .
lf you fight so well .
be a hitman , not a decorator .
none of your business .
please give me back my cheque .
a gentleman like me .
never argues with mean women .
thank you .
we' re together .

your passports and boarding passes .
you may board now .
thank you .
we' re not together .
she' s joking .
give them back .
why are you following me ?
going to japan to find your husband ?
swindlers !
what do you want ?
to get paid .
out of order .
bad luck never comes alone .
the lift is not working .
let me .
this is so heavy .
you' re moving here ?
lf so , one suitcase won' t do .
green doesn' t suit you .
you like green ?
a handle !
now that' s much better .
well ...
why don' t you shut up ?
not a bad idea .
that' s it .
takahashi yuji .
finally .
no violence please !
don' t worry .
come out and pay me !
ls this the right place ?
it' s empty .
has he moved ?
he' s your husband .
you should know .
i don' t .
he didn' t come to our wedding .
sorry !
takahashi ?
do you know them ?
i don' t !
get them !
what did he say ?
get us " !
tell them they' re mistaken .
you got it wrong .
are you after him ?
didn' t you tell them to stop ?
i did !
so stop it !
you did not .
did too .
after them !
thank you .
you' re welcome , macy .
you know me ?
did takahashi send you ?
where is he ?
you' il find out .
you know her ?
good thing she showed up .
those men know kung fu .
and they' re good .
thank her for me .
he' s very annoying .
done !
really ?
she said , " shut up " .
she didn' t even move her lips .
i' il talk to her .
you' re beautiful .
shut up !
sit tight , here they come .
closed .
welcome ...
come with me .
macy , welcome to tokyo .
watch those men for me .
yes , sir .
we' il talk upstairs .
please sit !
all of you can speak chinese .
who are you ?
they learned because they fancy the boss .
so did you .
go now !
yes , sir !
i' m lin , i' m chinese .
that' s arisa and sayuri !
naomi rescued you earlier .
they' re my assistants .
all japanese .
so is lady owner here .
we' re the good guys .
this is my name card .
you' re a private detective ?
listen up !
your attackers work for kobe gang leader lto .
their motive involves your fiance takahashi .
you are in great danger .
must we believe you ?
that' s up to you .
they were going to hong kong .
to look for macy .
mister .
how do you know so much ?
i also know you fight well .
really ?
why do they want me ?
why are you spying on us ?
both questions have the same answer .
to find takahashi through you .
ls he in trouble ?
lady owner .
yes .
the story began two weeks ago .
game over .
it' s my turn now .
i get 5 more tries .
stop that !
answer the door .
it' s business , hurry !
what a cheat !
hurry !
what' s the big rush ?
wait ...
do you know who i am ?
i can' t see .
boss of the kobe gang , japan' s biggest .
lto takeshi .
mr. lto to you .
whatever .
a private eye who speaks bad japanese .
but i like him .
what one needs is brains .
exactly why i' m here .
check this woman up .
it' s top secret .
why would a gang leader ask for my help ?
but it made perfect sense .
his woman was unfaithful .
how embarrassing if his men knew .
using a chinese who speaks bad japanese .
even if word got out .
no one would believe me .
there .
takahashi !
i missed you .
get these developed now .
yes !
may i see your work today ?
sure !
i soon found out .
takahashi heads a u. s. investment firm .
commuting around asia .
many japanese gang bosses are his clients .
lncluding lto and miyuki .
great work .
let' s have fun tonight .
thank you .
i' m a private eye .
i' m very flexible .
and greedy too .
life' s too short .
first time here ?
hi !
may i present ...
chinatown' s best private eye .
and my partner .
lndulge him .
he' s handsome .
cute too !
it was weird .
he told people i was his buddy .
and his partner .
two days later .
lto came .
i planned to sell the photos again .
why are you so late ?
my woman eloped with takahashi .
you saw him last .
i hear you' re his buddy .
where did they go ?
i don' t know .
you don' t ?
you don' t ? !
miyamoto .
i finally found out .
lto loves his wife miyuki dearly .
she managed finance for the gang .
so she knows everything .
she eloped with a lot of money .
and something important to the gang .
i haven' t found out what it is .
they' re gone , and i' m in trouble .
everyone is looking for them .
and their pals .
we' re in trouble until takahashi shows up .
so call the police .
who are you ?
yung , an interior designer .
no wonder you' re naive .
i called the police long ago .
but it' s no major crime .
they did zip .
what' s your plan then ?
macy , find takahashi for you .
why should i believe you ?
you decide .
that' s horrible .
such poor taste .
macy' s far better .
lucky you didn' t marry him .
you' re out of line .
i' m comforting her .
shut up !
let' s find you a safe place to rest .
takahashi , japanese .
raised in usa .
i know all this .
what does his company do ?
i don' t know .
i met him in tokyo .
he' s very secretive .
what about family and friends ?
he has few friends .
and no family here .
he earned everything by himself .
he mentioned any problems lately ?
a capable man like him .
can take care of his problems .
come off this adoration .
what do you talk about ?
that' s none of your business .
but he is never rude .
you know so little of him .
how can you marry him ?
none of your business .
so you don' t know he deals with gangs .
much less his affair with miyuki .
of course not .
perhaps his taste changed .
all right .
i' m after his money .
you like that answer ?
i' il go home tomorrow .
and forget about him .
sorry , i can' t help you .
big mouth .
i' m trying to help you .
your words stink .
and yours hurt .
sir ... yes , sir ...
i' il settle my debt .
yes , i know .
i will pay you back , honest .
i was conned .
no lies .
don' t shout at me .
that girl is helpless too .
good morning .
you' ve changed .
found your suitcase ?
i' m fine now .
i bought these this morning .
nice ?
yes !
i' il buy you breakfast .
delicious ?
yes .
are you feeding your grief ?
you should go to the airport now .
i' il take a later flight .
i can' t leave you alone .
i' ve already decided .
don' t worry !
i' m fine .
it' s your life .
why should i be worried ?
here !
for the bill ?
it' s for you .
for me ?
the code is 332335 .
i have about $200, 000 in my account .
what' s this ?
are you paying for takahashi ?
you' re an innocent victim .
take it as partial payment .
i don' t have the rest .
i' il call you if i find him .
332335 .
that' s 33 , 23 , 35 .
nice figure .
you are truly annoying .
the hips need work .
anyway , thanks .
you have yens ?
yes !
narita airport !
yes !
i' ve sent him away .
now what ?
okay !
can' t fool me !
mr. akagawa has been waiting .
thanks .
can i help you ?
just looking around .
now visitors .
please leave .
macy , my dear .
hi !
you may go home
have a seat .
takahashi said you can help me .
what happened to him ?
i don' t know .
he missed his own wedding .
i' m so worried .
think !
did he leave anything special ... in your care recently ?
thank you .
goodbye !
nothing special .
think carefully .
a key to a safe ?
a disk , or a notebook ?
hey , you .
please leave .
okay , sorry .
please leave !
okay .
bye .
nothing !
you want some coffee ?
sure !
what are you doing ?
tired ?
answer my questions now , understand ?
yes !
you drugged her .
who are you ?
come !
7th floor .
they both went up .
akagawa lnc .
you' re good .
hang in there .
yes , sir !
i' m mr. akagawa' s friend .
piece of cake .
save climbing stairs .
over here .
you know me ?
get in !
you rescued macy ?
when ?
you were too busy fighting .
you didn' t see me .
why didn' t you help me ?
you didn' t need help .
you had the easy job .
i' m the hero .
the hero always saves the beauty .
right !
the crook gave her something to drink .
are you macy ?
yes !
why are you looking for takahashi ?
he promised to marry me .
she sound like she' s been hypnotized .
she must have taken ttttt .
what' s that ?
till ... they tell the truth .
a drug ?
yes !
till they tell the truth is cla' s .
it' s a hypnotic drug .
it neutralizes your will power .
very effective on normal people .
but for trained spies .
or those with strong will power .
it' s useless .
did takahashi give you anything ?
yes , many things .
wedding gown designs .
weight loss menus ...
she' s babbling ...
and sweating .
wedding ring .
she won' t know where ... he stashes things .
it wouldn' t be banks .
does he have any lockers ?
yes , at a club .
name ?
i don' t know .
address ?
i forgot .
that' s no help .
i can go .
how ?
i remember the way .
then you can lead us there .
macy , wake up !
stop manhandling her .
she won' t talk after the drug wears off .
are you after takahashi' s money ?
or his girlfriend ?
don' t you want the truth ?
of course i do .
but she' s in pain .
you' re too nice .
now she' s fainted .
i can' t stand you .
i want to beat you up .
really ?
using your spinning kicks ?
no , fists will do .
you' re dead meat .
i am ?
i' il smash your face .
let' s find a place .
shut up .
fine .
how did i get here ?
you can' t remember anything ?
akagawa gave me some coffee .
then asked many questions .
macy !
let go .
she' s so ungrateful .
akagawa drugged you .
we didn' t .
we saved you .
whatever takahashi has on the gang .
i thought he might have given it to you .
so he can bargain if they catch him .
not the things you mentioned though .
maybe it' s in his club looker .
macy , wise up .
enough mystery cracking .
it' s getting dangerous .
we' il return to hong kong .
think you' il be safe there ?
that thing is important to akagawa and lto .
they' il find macy in hong kong .
let her decide .
the club .
we' il go tomorrow .
macy !
macy' s gone !
i checked on her every 10 minutes .
you were showering .
you sure took your time .
she' s waiting for us at the bar .
hurry .
you' ve had enough .
no problem .
3 more , please .
yes , miss .
she' s drunk .
how come ?
she' s heartbroken .
come drink with me .
go , drink with her .
aren' t you crazy about her ?
that' s enough .
drink .
no .
she' s classy .
beautiful and nice .
you fancy her .
no , just stating facts .
men are disposable .
like this can of grass .
don' t be silly .
yes , don' t be sad .
he' s not worth it .
you' ve lost a man , that' s all .
i know , i' ve lost a man .
but not only that .
i' ve lost my self respect , but ...
i' ve gained one thing .
a promise that can' t be fulfilled .
it' s not fair ?
it' s not ...
i turned against my dad .
went to marry him .
you think i went his money ?
i really love him .
was i drunk last night ?
we should turn right .
how would you know ?
trust me !
did i embarrass myself ?
take a right turn .
cut it out .
only macy knows .
left or right , macy ?
left !
i told you !
left' s what i meant .
you moron .
it' s upstairs .
you overacted .
what ?
it became phony .
i tried .
not good enough .
welcome .
this way , please .
welcome ...
member' s name ?
takahashi yuji .
pass code please .
this way .
he uses this code a lot .
saori , check club a for me .
yes , sir .
takahashi brought me here twice .
wait , on second , thought .
lf the thing is here .
our fate may worsen .
you leave then .
but everyone knows we' re together .
it' s empty .
the club is owned by lto .
let' s go !
why ?
welcome to my club .
i am lto .
these two have met my men .
who are you ?
you opened the looker .
so you know much about takahashi .
i can' t let any of you leave .
i' il see senator aoshima off .
capture them .
run !
sorry !
my purse and passport .
get the car !
what did he say ?
i couldn' t hear him .
let' s pick him up ahead .
wait for me !
he' s ahead .
sit tight .
jump !
what are you doing ?
payback time !
you look so handsome when you' re holding a gun .
let me see your gun .
this one ?
yes !
no way !
why not ?
what' s that for ?
guns are scarce in japan .
you' ve got one .
who are you ?
stop it .
it may backfire .
you said lto hired you .
but be didn' t recognize you .
you made things up .
the photos are fake ?
i can' t tell you .
then get out .
believe me , you can' t handle this .
he' s a liar .
get out .
lin !
everything ... you said is false ?
the photos are real !
so is takahashi' s elopement .
get out ...
let' s quit investigating .
we should return to hong kong .
we' ve go friends there .
i' m staying .
takahashi' s missing .
i' m going to the cops .
didn' t he tell you ?
it' s useless .
the cops will do nothing .
lin' s a liar .
take me to the cops .
please !
okay !
look over there .
$6, 920 , thank you .
and a telephone card .
boss , it' s me .
i' ve done what you asked .

i' il get her back .
safely to hong kong .

well done .
thank you .
how' s he doing ?
ask him .

you' re no private eye .
who are you ?
find out yourself .
private eye yung .
yung , hong konger , age 29 .
fascinated with martial arts .
attended the academy of martial arts at 17 .
champion 4 years in a row .
wrong file ?
no !
turned private eye and bodyguard .
back in 1994 .
you' re good .
of course !
we' re not done yet .
3 months ago ,
tai lee bank' s chairman hired you .
to pose as an interior designer .
to research takahashi' s motive for pursuing ... his daughter macy .
but you found nothing .
then ran into this mess .
now you lost macy .
ls she correct ?
how did you find out ?
my assistants are good .
they bribed ... your employees .
saori , find macy .
yes , sir !
lmpressive !
i' ve researched you .
you' re not private eye .
you came to japan at 12 .
were educated here .
the rest is classified .
how strange .
are you an undercover cop ?
why should i tell you ?
that' s true .
we are friends now .
i don' t want to see you helpless .
this thing' s too complicated .
you' re out of your league .
go back to hong kong .
i' il find macy .
i was going to the airport .
we shouldn' t have brought you back .
exactly .
we screwed up .
we' il take you to the airport .
no tricks now .

i' ve had enough .
but please tell me who you are .

thanks .
it' s good to be free .
i' ve had it with you !

thanks !
i' m half japanese , a defense ministry staff .
lnternal affairs ,
external division .
want it in english ?
yes .
i' m a spy .
no wonder it' s classified .
your ld ?
right here , take a good look .
a real spy .
what do you want to know ?
here' s the first question .
who is takahashi ?
akagawa drugged macy .
he and takahashi are cla agents .
their investment firm is a front .
they used lto and his gang .
to circulate counterfeit yens .
to devalue the yen .
the cla sent takahashi to marry macy .
to get to her dad .
but he fell for lto' s woman .
he kept evidence on cla' s dealings ... with the gang and the senate as protection .
ln case lto found out about him and miyuki .
ten days ago , lto discovered the affair . so they eloped with the evidence .
the cla and the gang couldn' t find them .
their only clue was macy .
last night , the cla transferred akagawa out .
now you know .
macy' s in great danger .
exactly .
then i can' t leave .
let me help you .
how can i refuse ?
you might beat me up .
she needs help .
yes ?
come over .
you too , suzuki .
sorry , please wait .
senator aoshima reported an assault , by 2 men and a woman , at club a today .
their graphic impressions .
are being faxed over .
yes , sir !
miss , you want a job ?
posing for a video .
no .
but it pays well .
hold it !
left her coat .
may i borrow 10 yen ?
bye , lady .
this is macy .
i lost everything .
send someone for me .
what do you want ?
my bodyguard is coming .
he' s very tough .
and big .
a savage man .
hairy !
like ... a gorilla .
he' il beat you up .
you' d better go .
my dear macy .
it' s you who sent for me .
i did not .
you called your dad .
he sent me .
i am that hairy bodyguard of yours .
he' s the private eye your dad hired .
i don' t believe you .

i' il strip you naked .

thanks !
you' re welcome .

freeze or i' il shoot !
how did you find us ?
you took the tissues .
before entering the noodle shop .
we control the tissue givers ... in this area .
it' s all your fault .
why ?
hie men give out the tissues .
where' s takahashi ?
spit it out .
or you will die .
don' t kill me .
i can lead you to takahashi .
i agreed to be his smoke screen .
what' s she saying ?
she' s takahashi' s smoke screen .
to distract the cla and lto .
we' re meeting 3 pm tomorrow .
they' il meet at the rainbow club .
she conned us .
vice versa .
that' s true .
i' ve given up on him .
i can lure him out for you .
miyamoto .

yes !
they' il kill you once they get him .
shut up !

get near her , see if takahashi ...
left the evidence with her .
yes , sir !
he woke up yesterday .
we flew him here .
but he' d say nothing .
the cla found out .
either we turn him in within 24 hours .
or it becomes a diplomatic conflict .
so macy was innocent .
she was stalling .
we revealed our identities .
she knew we could save her .
use that ttttt on him .
he' s trained cla agent .
it won' t work .
why didn' t you tell us ?
we wanted you to leave .
it' s getting dangerous for you two .
what' s next ?
i have a plan .

uncuff yourself !
you did come .
run , lto' s here .
i' il kill you now .
you' il disappear with the evidence .
i' ve left copies with friends .
lf i don' t call every 10 days .
they' il send their copies to the media .
and the japanese police .
you' d better wish me a long life .
macy' s in danger .
but this may incriminate them .
drop your guns !
help me leave .
we' il bargain later .
