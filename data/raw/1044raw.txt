one pair of bloomers , two pairs of stockings ...
just a moment .
one slip .
sorry i couldn' t get them to you sooner .
goodbye lieutenant gates .
what a stinker you are .
did i forget something ?
dirty stinker , get right back in there and explain to them how you got my laundry by mistake and forgot to give it back to me .
it' s such a dull story .
who would care ?
you know what they think .
i don' t understand ...
oh , no ...
you mean you and me ?
i' il explain that the idea is revolting .
oh , no you don' t .
never mind .
i' d be delighted to explain that i think you' re repulsive .
never mind .
forget it .
you' ve had your joke , now beat it .
i' m here on official business .
don' t tell me .
another mission ?
don' t get your hopes up .
you' re not coming with me .
thank heavens .
who is your victim ?
my interpreter and aide is lieutenant eloise billings , who i' m reliably informed is intelligent , pretty and , as you americans say , stacked .
that she is .
you haven' t met her ?
no , that will occur in major prendergast' s office in 30 seconds .
goodbye again , lieutenant gates .
where are you going ?
major prendergast' s office .
there' s nothing for you to do there .
wait ...
i' m in a hurry .
hello , eloise .
hi , honey .
capt. rochard , lieutenant billings .
you' il work together .
enchanted .
how do you do ...
we have a mutual friend , alex brissac .
sure , i remember him .
as i was on previous missions with capt. rochard , he just returned some of my things .
perhaps i can help .
i can explain .
don' t you have somewhere to go ?
no , i' m free until 2 . 30 .
about this mission ...
it' s simple .
we have to go to bad nauheim , a pleasant village ...
till you get there .
i can explain better when we' re alone .
better wear side arms .
he uses maps instead of etchings .
i' ve so looked forward to going to bad nauheim .
the french army shoe is slightly different .
hold the foot , junior .
yes , yes .
as shown by the captain' s foot and my thigh .
for goodness sake !
that was purely accidental .
the mark on my chin ...
may i have my foot ?
thank you .
the mark under my chin was an accident .
my fault entirely .
i tripped while he was chasing me .
will you shut up ?
see ?
something i' d never have mentioned , his temperament .
but he' s not to blame , more like a form of epilepsy .
will you shut up ?
i tell you ...
will you sh ... ?
henri , i' m talking .
yes , you are .
i tell you because we' re members of the same army and the same sex .
it' s only fair to warn you that jack the ripper is up that alley .
in case anything happens , would you give me your mother' s address ?
i' ve been trying to tell you , i' m not going on this mission .
i' m going to frankfurt with colonel bliven .
but who ?
you' re going with him .
who is jack the ... ?
honey , maybe you better leave me your mother' s address .
hello , captain rochard .
i was going to send for you , gates .
come in .
you too , captain .
this shouldn' t take long .
gates , billings is needed elsewhere .
you' il go with captain rochard .
thank you , no .
if i may suggest , lieutenant perry has almost finished her assignment ...
no experience .
the captain wants our best , don' t you ?
well , major , this is not an important mission .
my government request for an officer is only a technicality ...
your orders call for our full co operation , i' il see you get it .
here' s your identity card , security pass and ration card .
gates , captain rochard will brief you on the mission .
yes , major .
major , this lieutenant perry , she ought to do .
you' re very kind , but we' re used to being short handed .
besides , if i remember , you' ve had assignments with gates before , and very successfully .
recovered art treasures stolen by the nazis from the lille museum " .
located hidden documents relating to rocket research .
received legion of merit ...
she' s your man .
wish she were .
pardon ?
nothing .
is there anything else ?
no , thank you .
you' ve done more than you realise .
good luck then .
goodbye , major .
jack the ripper was a famous ...
thank you .
thank you , captain .
i wonder what the army would do if i deserted ?
they' d shoot you .
the thought makes my mouth water .
i' d almost prefer it myself .
which way do we go ?
well , let' s get the briefing over .
what' s the job ?
you don' t need to know .
come on , what' s the job ?
to keep your mouth shut and do as i tell you .
i need to know what equipment to draw from the quartermaster .
see if they have a spare head .
i warn you , bubble mouth , i' il carry a revolver and a trench knife .
if you touch me , you' il go back minus a lot of parts you value .
there you go again , you idiot .
i didn' t touch you .
i' m sorry , but we' re stuck together .
why not make the best of it ?
there is no best .
i' il go crazy if you ...
we turn here .
i' il go crazy if you keep losing your maniac temper .
let' s grow up .
i' m sorry about the wine cellar .
i have no temper .
no one ever accused me of that !
they didn' t ?
do you remember the last time i saw you ?
you were chasing me around dsseldorf swearing you' d tear my head off and make me eat it .
and what colour was i ?
i was a lovely robin' s egg blue .
you looked so funny .
on account of being pushed into a vat of dye by you !
i didn' t know , i thought it was water .
water ...
blue , all over , blue .
it' s your own fault .
drinking free wine and turning into an octopus ...
you misunderstood .
i was trying to be friendly .
i' m sorry , i misunderstood .
let' s forget it , the dye has come off .
no , it hasn' t .
it hasn' t ?
no .
i' m sorry .
that' s all right , there' s an advantage in being an oddity .
in here , henri .
hello , jack .
hello .
what' s so funny ?
it' s difficult to describe .
captain rumsey , captain rochard of the french economic mission .
je suis enchant de faire votre connaissance .
hiya .
have you some orders for me ?
all ready , burns ...
cathy , this means no dance for me saturday night .
don' t be silly , take kitty .
i' d rather sit in my room and think of you .
wouldn' t you , captain ?
alone , in my room .
take good care of her .
i' il watch her every moment .
that' s fine .
we better be going .
bye , jack .
how about dinner the night you get back ?
it' s a deal .
alors , mon capitaine ...
avez ...
avez de bonne chance .
see you in church .
sure .
so long .
so long .
that linguist is stuck on you .
what' s the matter with him ?
it' s only natural that you wouldn' t understand .
it certainly is .
you chase after anything in skirts .
they' re all the same to you .
but lots of men can tell them apart .
sometimes they find one they like more than the others .
that' s called love .
you probably haven' t experienced it , but you must' ve read about it .
where are we going ?
i go that way , i have to get my stuff .
where do i go ?
i have to pay off my cab .
i' il meet you at the motor pool in twenty minutes .
before you go .
why did you say i run after everything in skirts ?
i didn' t .
i said anything .
that' s different , then .
american women ...
for weeks , you' ve been talking about the man as if he had jaundice .
he did .
now you' re over the moon because you' il be alone with him three days .
you can do a lot in three days .
if you work at it .
what about the dye ?
is he still blue ?
he' s still mad , but he' s fun to fight with .
bring that , will you ?
sure .
are you ready , captain ?
quite ready , lieutenant .
morning , sergeant .
we need transportation to bad nauheim .
sorry , you' re all out of luck .
we' il settle for a jeep .
all we' ve got are motorcycles and side cars .
come on , sergeant .
did you look at your orders ?
what about those cars ?
you' ve got priority 4 .
that' s bottom .
well , captain , what do we do ?
we' il have to take a motorcycle .
are you checked out on motorcycles ?
i can drive one .
if you ain' t checked out , you can' t .
i have a motorcycle licence .
well , i guess that fixes you up .
we' il wait for a car .
i can drive one .
i' m sure .
i' m good on a motorcycle .
my brother had one , we went hill climbing .
i can even ride standing up .
what for ?
i can still ride a motorcycle .
or are you afraid ?
we' il take it , sergeant .
and i am afraid .
any one of these ?
sure , take your pick .
remember , she has to drive .
that' s regulations .
thank you .
sergeant , can we have a helmet and goggles ?
in the toolbox , lieutenant .
yes .
thanks .
what are you laughing at ?
begging your pardon , how do you intend to ride ?
side saddle ?
no .
begging your pardon , astride .
it' s a shame .
excuse me .
how far is it to bad nauheim ?
about 120 kilometres .
do you know the way ?
i' ve got a map .
of germany ?
yes , captain , of germany .
you' il be all right .
lieutenant !
you forgot something !
never mind , let her go .
sorry , i took it off for oiling and forgot to hook it up .
take this one , it' s all in one piece .
it would be better , don' t you agree ?
i don' t know .
you don' t ?
yes , i don' t know .
you know how silly you look sitting there ?
is it still so funny ?
no , i was just thinking how nice it' d be if this one came off while we were driving .
oh , i dropped my lipstick .
it rolled over there .
get it , will you ?
it' s a pleasure to get out of this portable bathtub .
i can' t reach it .
it' s over there .
climb over the top .
let me down !
let me down !
henri , what are you doing up there ?
what' s the deal ?
the area' s sealed off from here to battenberg .
what for ?
rounding up a gang of black market dealers .
i have a pass .
sorry , it' s no good .
i' ve got a general pass .
keep it .
all passes are suspended .
for how long ?
8 to 12 hours , maybe 24 .
i' m sorry .
well ?
i might' ve known .
don' t blame me .
it' s not my fault .
what' il we do ?
i can' t wait here .
i' ve got to be in bad nauheim at 3 pm tomorrow .
if this thing had wings , we could ...
what' s wrong with that ?
what ?
that boat .
it should say u. s. navy on it .
why not put the motorcycle on it and row down past battenberg ?
it' s not far .
we can pick up the road there .
do you think they' il let us ?
we can try .
lieutenant , can we take that boat and row past battenberg ?
so long as you don' t row on the road , it' s none of my business .
can we have some help ?
thanks .
sergeant christian !
yes ?
bring some men over here .
watch your feet .
put it in gear .
thanks .
lieutenant , tell the o. i. c we' il return the boat or telegraph him where to pick it up .
will you help us to shove off ?
thanks .
have a nice trip .
thanks .
grab an oar .
me ?
yes , you .
an oar .
pull , pull .
pull .
what' s that ahead ?
a bridge .
it' s not on the map , though .
where are we ?
a couple of miles should do it .
what' s that noise ?
sounds like a c 47 .
it' s bigger than that , must be a c 54 .
must be a lot of c 47s .
c 54s !
whatever kind of planes the are , they make a lot of noise .
it doesn' t ...
henri , row for shore , quick !
why ?
don' t argue , row !
let me tell you something .
i' m going straight down this river .
you sure are , but you' re going over a waterfall first .
that' s different ...
henri , stop playing ostrich !
hold this !
let' s try to pull ourselves free !
all right .
come on , pull , pull hard !
i' m pulling !
now we' re getting it !
danke !
now row .
i' m rowing .
come on , henri , pull .
row hard .
i am !
now , turn it around .
i' il turn it .
you' re so clumsy !
have you got it ?
a bit more .
that' s awfully wet ground you' re sitting on .
at the moment , i can' t feel anything , but , when i do , i' m going to kick you bowlegged .
for what ?
for saving your life ?
oh , yes .
you did catch that rope .
i did .
convenient , wasn' t it ?
they always are .
i suppose i owe you something .
i' il call it square if you explain the mission .
come on , henri .
there' s a man there who grinds lenses .
his name is ...
what' s the matter ?
charley horse .
roll over , i can fix that .
never mind .
go ahead with the story .
his name' s schindler .
a lens grinder .
i have to persuade him that we' il pay more than the black market .
that' s sore .
roll over , i' m good at that .
all right .
what' s our problem ?
no problem .
a few well chosen words , a contract , a passport and then home .
that' s the whole plot .
simple , isn' t it ?
i don' t see why they assigned me to this mission .
they didn' t want to make it too easy .
how is my leg ?
not bad , better than i remembered .
perhaps the other ...
no , never mind .
that' il do .
help me up .
i was just being friendly .
but you' re never friendly from a distance .
henri , one move , and it won' t be a vat of dye , it' il be the river .
you wouldn' t .
yes , i would .
i think you would .
catherine , your lack of co operation is amazing !
i' il co operate by finding out where we are .
who put us on the river ?
i knew you' d say that .
you' re tiresome .
you' re subnormal .
i don' t propose to argue any further .
that darn road doesn' t come within 10 kilometres of here .
across open country in that thing ?
it' il be a little bumpy , but we' il make it by 3 o' clock .
we won' t get there before dark , if we get there at all .
this motorcycle will go anywhere , if you help me get it out of the boat .
we' il be on the road in no time .
pitch dark .
we' re lost , absolutely lost .
is there a difference ?
haven' t you got a bump of direction ?
it' s the only kind i haven' t got .
come on , you drive .
my back hurts .
you' re the one who checked out on the motorcycle .
stop being so cute .
i hate you when you ...
what' s that ?
listen .
we must' ve been driving alongside that road for the last hour .
perhaps they just moved it there .
oh , shut up .
there' s a sign back there .
see what it says .
i don' t suppose you have a flashlight ?
no , i haven' t .
what does it say ?
i can' t see !
well , climb up , silly .
hurry up , it' s starting to rain .
what does it say ?
i can' t tell .
it' s in german .
well , move your arm !
you can come down now , henri .
what does it say ?
never mind , get in .
what does it say ?
" wet paint " .
how many miles ... ?
no , henri .
no , no .
you' il get wet .
get in the sidecar .
i know .
hurry up .
all right , we' re in bad nauheim .
you can come out .
are you sure ?
yes , i' m sure .
and bring my bag .
good evening , come in .
do you have any free rooms for this evening ?
of course .
do you want a one or two rooms ?
two , please .
what are you talking about ?
he wanted to know if we want one room or two .
you told him ?
i told him .
come this way .
what' s the matter ?
my back , i think it' s broken .
and it' s all your fault .
if you' d got that cow out of the way , we needn' t have taken that detour .
it was a bull .
cow .
you said you couldn' t tell at 20 yards away .
i know , but it couldn' t be a bull , he would' ve had horns .
who is it ?
cinderella .
what do you want ?
my slipper .
well , open the door .
what do you want ?
you just said that .
how' s your back ?
awful .
it hurts .
get into bed .
i will not get into bed .
what are you doing ?
what' s that ?
i brought you a drink .
i thought so .
i knew you' d get up to your ...
and some liniment to rub your back .
get into bed .
we' il need some water .
take your shirt off too .
i am not going to take my shirt off .
how am i going to rub your back through it ?
you won' t rub my back through anything , including my foolishness .
here , drink this .
want some water ?
no .
it' s good .
my back ...
do you want it rubbed or not ?
is that stuff any good ?
turn over .
wait a minute .
stop bawling .
i don' t want them to think we smuggled in a cow .
it stings .
it' s supposed to .
let it soak in for a while .
relax .
you' re dislocating everything .
relax .
i hurt further up .
how can you relax if you won' t co operate ?
i said i hurt further up .
that' s better .
makes me feel sleepy .
good .
that' s nice , henri .
i' m sorry i thought when you came in you were behaving like a stinker .
you' ve been a stinker for so long , i just didn' t ...
i know .
go to sleep .
with you in the room ?
i can' t rub you from the hallway .
if i go to sleep , will you promise to leave .
i' il go now .
no ...
feels good .
go to sleep , i' il be gone in a minute .
henri , about this mission ...
never mind .
i just want to ask you a question .
what ?
is this mission so important ?
it is to me .
it' s my last assignment for the army .
i' m getting out next week .
i didn' t know that .
then , it is important , isn' t it ?
henri , i ...
i' m so sleepy ...
good night .
she' il never believe me .
what happened ?
what happened ?
you unspeakable weasel , i knew you' d be up to your old tricks .
that' s ridiculous .
get out .
i said get out .
i can' t .
why not ?
the door handle came off .
what an excuse .
couldn' t you think of a better one ?
i don' t believe you .
you try to open the door .
all right , i will .
try to open the door .
how did you do that ?
you liar , you ...
you' re worse than i thought .
put on your shoes and get out .
don' t speak to me .
do you understand ?
don' t speak to me again .
ever !
i don' t want to talk to you .
don' t speak to me .
stop banging on that door !
you can' t come in !
i' m in .
magic .
henri , i told you not to speak to me .
someone' s out there .
perhaps they' il let me out .
who is it ?
wer ist da ?
it' s me , the innkeeper' s wife .
ein moment .
we must do something .
i know , get out that window .
you can' t be found here .
don' t argue .
american women ...
but ...
come in .
guten morgen .
morgen , fraulein .
the door handle came off .
it' s happened before .
i put it back .
i' m very sorry .
climbing in the nice young lady' s room ?
raus hier !
raus hier !
henri !
come in .
excuse me , i was looking for captain ...
henri .
no ...
what do you want ?
you look like an organ grinder .
excuse me .
sorry .
excuse me .
what was that ?
the innkeeper .
i' ve borrowed his clothes .
why ?
i came here to find herr schindler .
i' m going to the black market hangouts to see what i can find out .
if i' m in uniform , no one will tell me anything .
is that reasonable ?
see you later .
don' t you want any help ?
no .
oh , now , henri ...
i' m sorry about the door handle .
you were telling the truth .
nice of you to apologise .
that fixes everything .
what more can i do ?
i often wonder .
henri , stop being like that .
you' re behaving like a little boy .
i know it .
you said it was important , i just want to help .
never mind .
can i try to find schlindler on my own ?
i could do something ...
don' t do anything .
you make me so mad , you don' t want my help .
don' t do anything .
if you see me , don' t speak to me , you don' t know me .
why not ?
you' re in uniform .
they' il think i' m a stool pigeon .
can' t i go out by myself ?
just take orders .
remember , you don' t know me .
all right .
you can' t speak to me .
okay .
i' m transparent , you can' t see me .
i never could , not for sour apples .
you stubborn ...
he makes me so mad , i could ...
catherine .
catherine gates .
jowitt , how are you ?
good to see you .
what are you doing here ?
i' m on a mission .
i' il tell you about it .
shall we get breakfast ?
i know where we can get real coffee .
come on .
will you be here long ?
just for a couple of days .
fine .
here we are .
bill trumble , catherine gates .
hello .
how are you ?
sit down .
catherine just got in .
guten morgen .
want anything besides coffee ?
jam rolls , anything .
make it for two .
jawohl .
how long will you be here ?
just a couple of days .
you haven' t said why you' re here .
it' s not much of a story ...
isn' t that the fellow you were talking to at the inn ?
yes , that' s him .
he' s going into the wrong place .
that' s a black market hangout .
bill has a friend in the mps .
the german police are going to raid that place this morning .
the place he just went into ?
that' s why we' re here for breakfast .
get a floor show for free .
you couldn' t have chosen a better spot .
here they are now .
watch them operate .
she can identify me , an officer of the u. s. army .
come here .
catherine , tell these men who i am .
identify me , please .
is something wrong , officer ?
lieutenant , he says he' s a french officer and you know him .
i never saw him before in my life .
that' s what i thought !
you shouldn' t have done this .
i' il get even !
i' il get even !
i' il get even , traitor !
i' il get even !
what is going on here ?
i' il tell you later .
could you help me find a german lens grinder named schindler ?
sure .
we ought to be able to help .
think so ?
is this the man ?
yes , that' s captain rochard .
good morning , henri .
i trust you understand .
there was nothing else we could do .
no identity card ...
it was not really our fault .
don' t worry , i' m entirely aware of whose fault it was .
henri , i did exactly as you told me .
thank you , captain .
one question .
why have you no beds here ?
didn' t you have a bed ?
you see , when we had beds , everyone wished to be arrested .
it was terrible .
people did anything , just so they could have a bed .
i know how they felt .
poor dear , you haven' t had a wink ...
shut up .
may i go now ?
of course .
thank you very much .
i' d like a word with you , outside .
of course , i want to talk to you , too .
i want you to meet this ...
i' il get even , i swear .
even if it takes years , if it takes forever .
go away , i' m busy .
i' il break you ...
like a dry twig , i' il turn you into a shaky old woman ...
i said i was busy . ... with tin cup .
this is the man ...
i understand you can be a rat , but there' s one thing that baffles me ...
there' s no pleasing some people .
it' s your job .
the army gave you an assignment .
you took an oath as an officer , the oath of duty .
i followed your orders .
we' il never find schindler .
where is he now ?
he' il have heard i' m looking for him and gone underground .
i know how those fellows work .
what do you want ?
who are you ? .
schindler .
fine .
will you please stop ... ?
you' re schindler ?
why didn' t you say so ?
you wouldn' t give anyone a chance to say a word .
button your big lip so he can talk .
he hasn' t much time before his train .
i just wanted to say i' m so glad , so grateful , so full of happiness .
thank you .
well , goodbye .
wait , i want to talk to you .
he' il miss his train .
i' m going to paris , french economic bureau .
i have my passport , documents and contract .
i took them out of your briefcase .
this wonderful lady gave and told me everything .
so , i leave germany now .
i never wanted to be in the black market .
i' m a scientist .
now , i' il work for science and for france .
no more like a thief in the night .
thank you .
thank you .
goodbye .
thank you again .
goodbye .
nice little guy .
so , you found him ...
i ran into him .
someone i knew , knew him .
he was very anxious to go , as you heard .
it was easy .
yeah , easy .
easy .
go ahead , start hollering , calling me names ...
guten morgen .
was darf sein , bitte ?
bitte , haben sie kaffee ?
zwei , bitte .
just a minute , do you speak english ?
sure .
you know , there' s nothing i' ve ever really wanted in life .
fame , money , position .
nothing , until now .
there' s just one thing : never to see you again as long as i live .
that was a rotten thing to say ...
will you get the coffee , please ?
that was mean rotten .
maybe , but it wasn' t accidental .
fortunately , i' m leaving the army .
i' il be a civilian .
never again can they order me to work with you .
i' m going back to heidelberg by train .
get some other chump to torture in that sidecar .
i know why you' re mad .
i don' t blame you , i would be too .
i knew it was your last job .
i didn' t think , i spoiled it for you .
i' d give anything if i hadn' t .
i' d cut off my arm , almost .
i like you , henri .
i can' t help it .
you' re stubborn and you don' t know anything , but i don' t want you to disappear without saying you' il write , or kick me , or use my toothbrush .
i wouldn' t put it past you .
after all we' ve been to each other .
and all we haven' t been .
after all we' ve done together .
and all we haven' t .
i know that' s not your fault .
it' s mine and i feel ...
i' m making a fool of myself .
now , get out or say something nice .
i don' t know , catherine ...
that was nice , henri .
please , say more .
if we' re going to get back before dark , we better be going .
henri ...
but , catherine , just one thing .
pay for the coffee .
yes , henri .
what happened ?
you went to sleep so i pulled over .
i thought this would be better .
thank you .
i' ve been thinking .
why do we fight all the time ?
you tell me .
sex antagonism , i guess .
what does that mean ?
i think it means just the opposite of what it sounds like .
i can' t even think what it sounds like .
henri , i think it means we like each other , but won' t admit it .
i' d like it distinctly understood ...
if i weren' t so sleepy ...
don' t do it .
go to sleep .
i will .
are you all right ?
go back to sleep .
why are we stopping ?
i want to see a man about a road .
i' il be back in a minute .
take your time .
aufwiedersehen !
henri !
henri !
i like you very much .
in fact , i' d miss you if you weren' t here .
henri , stop !
come back !
henri !
oh , no ...
catherine , now that i' ve told you how i feel ...
my , this is terribly bumpy .
look out !
catherine !
catherine !
darling , are you all right ?
where are you ?
yes , i' m here .
i' m coming .
i can hear you , but i can' t find you .
darling , are you all right ?
where are you ?
here i am , over here .
there you are .
darling , thank goodness you' re safe .
how did you get out there ?
wait a minute .
i' m all out of breath from chasing you .
chasing me ?
you weren' t on the motorcycle ?
you were by yourself .
you got off and left me .
henri , what' s all this " darling " business you were mumbling about ?
darling ?
did i say that ?
i heard you .
probably fright , it' s natural .
did you mean me ?
i think i was stunned momentarily .
maybe , but you looked like you were going to kiss me when you saw me .
i what ?
i wish you had .
i' ve never been kissed by a frenchman .
what' s so strange about that ?
you know what people say .
that' s nonsense .
you hear people talk ...
we' re no different than anybody else .
i don' t know , i' ve just heard talk .
that' s silly .
why don' t you try it and let me see ?
catherine ...
it' s the only way to find out .
but it' s so silly .
no harm in trying , is there ?
i suppose not .
all right , go ahead .
are you ready ?
sure .
that was no good , that wasn' t different at all .
i told you it wouldn' t be .
i thought it' d be better than that .
you didn' t give me much of a chance .
that wasn' t fair .
of course it wasn' t .
i ought to give you another chance .
yes , you ought .
go ahead , try again .
all right .
come here .
well , that was a little better .
see ?
could' ve been even better if i' d had some co operation .
if i' d had a french girl here ...
what do you mean by that remark ?
you haven' t been giving me much help .
you think a french girl could do better ?
yes , i do .
do you want to try again ?
yes .
so do i.
wait a minute .
lean back .
comfortable ?
yes .
major , we want to get married .
when did you reach that decision ?
this afternoon , about 2 : 30 .
in a haystack , henri was on the motorcycle ...
i don' t think the major will be interested in the details .
and you two didn' t want to go away together .
it would seem your mission was very successful .
thank you .
congratulations .
you' re the first to know .
i guessed as much .
as to getting married , there' s one hitch .
itch ?
it' s probably the haystack ...
i don' t ...
hitch .
marriages between american military personnel and aliens , and you come under that heading , must be approved by the general .
there' s a set procedure .
it' s only red tape .
do you itch , catherine ?
she said " hitch " .
we' ve got to get things approved .
here are the forms .
fill them out in quadruplicate .
when completed , send them to the colonel' s office .
and good luck .
goodbye , captain .
yes .
is she always so confusing ?
no , but this will be .
look at all this stuff we' ve got to fill in .
she said there were only four .
you misheard .
she said four of each .
let' s go to my room to work .
fine .
wait a minute .
souvenir .
you' il end up with a pocketful .
this is impossible .
don' t give up now , we' re half way through .
my uncle' s politics , my aunt' s religion , any warts ...
by the way , my aunt' s name is fanny .
put that down .
any identifying scars on my second cousin' s clavicle ...
we' il never get this done .
name your father' s gender " .
no ...
it says so .
no , father' s birthplace .
gender belongs to this question .
i thought there was something wrong .
idiot .
were you ever captured by peruvian indians ?
no , why ?
i understand they do a good job of shrinking heads .
come on , let' s take time out .
there are a lot of things i' d rather do than answer questions .
this , for instance ?
maybe i better go back and see another double feature .
no , come on in .
we' re still filling out forms .
if anyone wants to do that with me , let me know .
i' m going to sleep .
good night .
we' ve got to get busy .
why do we have to go through all this ?
it' s the army' s way of finding out if you really want to get married .
i know a much better way .
mayor prendergast .
yes .
at ease , gates .
that' il be all right .
well , gates ?
i' m sorry to bother you , but we haven' t heard a word in over a week .
your papers must' ve bogged down .
isn' t there something you can do ?
he' s getting nervous , and so am i.
i' il see what i can do .
i' il let you know .
thank you , major .
gates ...
yes ?
he is worth waiting for , isn' t he ?
he is now .
i don' t know what he' il be like by the time i get him .
i can' t understand her marrying a foreigner she hardly knows .
it' s ridiculous and disgraceful .
i can' t see why she wants to .
you better get glasses .
why are you women such pushovers for this parlez vous hand kissing ?
hand kissing ?
he does more than that .
catherine told me he was plum crazy , chasing her and beating her up .
he left marks all over her , i saw them .
he could leave marks on me any time .
i' d bring the stick .
it wasn' t a stick .
he kicked her right in the ...
what ?
he did .
hi , catherine .
we were just talking about you .
i bet you were .
well , say something .
did you see her ?
don' t lose your temper .
the papers are stuck somewhere .
stuck how ?
bogged down , lying on someone' s desk .
what for ?
henri , please .
i don' t know .
they let other people get married .
what' ve they got against you ?
me ?
it' il be you they' re investigating .
nonsense .
why should they ?
please .
there are other people here .
why should they investigate me ?
because the american army is very careful .
they better be , or they won' t have any american children .
will you lower your voice ?
i' il do better .
i' il take it somewhere else .
do that .
and while you' re about it , go bag your oars .
bag your oars ?
what' s that ?
more army talk ?
navy .
naval talk .
charming .
you make me sick .
good .
henri ...
excuse me .
catherine , let me ask you something like a brother .
do you really want to marry that phoney joker ?
certainly not .
you' re kidding ?
i hope he chokes , slowly .
very slowly .
that' s what i said .
a girl like you couldn' t make a mistake like that .
thank heavens for army red tape .
don' t thank the army .
thank me , personally .
you ?
why ?
i hid the papers .
i knew you' d change your mind .
you hid the papers ?
i knew i was doing you a favour .
you hid the papers ...
i filed them .
i don' t mind going out on a limb for a friend .
it was taking a chance , sure ...
now , your marriage .
catherine , you want me to marry you in my church .
and you , henri , promised the pastor of your parish he' d do the job .
yes .
you better have both marriages .
i think he' s right , henri .
let' s get started .
just a moment .
there' s more to it .
under german law , recognised by the occupying army , you have to go through a civil ceremony before the church ceremony .
so you have to be married by the burgermeister in heidelberg and then , come to me , and then go to henri' s pastor .
that makes three times .
three ?
in china , the bride and groom drink tea out of the same bowl , that' s it .
are you chinese ?
of course not .
i thought not .
i' m not .
what brought that up ?
you mentioned drinking tea .
i was telling the chaplain ...
i' il drink tea with you .
stop it .
perhaps i shouldn' t go through with this .
you can still say no .
we' il go to the burgermeister and come back .
i' il be ready , any time .
thank you .
don' t pay any attention to her .
goodbye .
goodbye .
captain henri rochard , catherine gates ...
you' ve decided to live your future life together .
... and forsaking all others , keep thee only unto him , so long as you both shall live ?
i will .
please join right hands .
henri , will you repeat after me ,
i , henri ... take thee , catherine ... to be my wedded wife ...
he wants the ring .
i haven' t got it .
here .
je t' pouse avec cet anneau .
well , like it ?
i like it .
it' s been quite a day .
we' re a lot married , three times .
it was worth it .
i don' t see how we could ever get a divorce .
it would be like unwinding the inside of a golf ball .
want some more coffee ?
i just had four cups .
besides , it keeps me awake .
what' s the matter ?
i' m just thinking about a friend on his wedding night .
what happened ?
you see , he was ...
pardon , monsieur .
il y a quelque chose que vous voulez ?
non , non , non .
bon soir .
tell me about it .
what ?
your friend , on his wedding night .
i' m not so sure i can tell you .
of course you can .
that' s right , i can now , can' t i ?
well , here' s what happened ...
this is just like my friend' s story .
now what ?
can i come in ?
you' re in .
i didn' t want to come , but ...
then go away .
kitty , why are you here ?
i thought you' d gone back .
of all the times ...
what do you want , anyway ?
i certainly didn' t want to come here .
then go away .
i' ve got something to tell you and you' re not going to like it .
what ?
the colonel gave orders you' re to leave for heidelberg in 20 minutes .
you' re kidding !
the whole outfit' s going back to america .
america ?
well , not right away .
we don' t have to leave tonight .
maybe you don' t , but catherine does .
those are orders .
when do i have to report ?
not until morning .
then we stay here , fly back and report in the morning .
tell the colonel you couldn' t find us .
he said if i tried to pull that one , we' d both be sorry .
i' m in a spot , so are you .
get working on henri' s passport , or he won' t be able to sail with you .
henri , we' re dead .
this is a fine wedding night !
find a place to stay in heidelberg , it' s better than nothing .
what do you mean , nothing ?
start packing .
you' ve only got 20 minutes .
how do we get back from here ?
plane to frankfurt , there' il be a jeep there .
see you later .
orders are i' m to stick with you till you get back to heidelberg .
orders ...
orders ?
orders ...
they wouldn' t do this in the french army .
poor henri ...
want me to wait for you ?
what do you mean ?
all night ?
i don' t think it' il be that long .
what trouble are you dreaming up now ?
bachelor officers ' quarters .
i don' t care .
that' s where i live and where i' il take my wife .
it' s against regulations .
who cares about regulations at a time like this ?
besides , i know the sergeant and he always looks the other ...
he' s a very nice fellow from tulsa , oklahoma .
please take the lieutenant home .
goodnight , kitty .
goodnight .
come along .
but ...
please .
goodnight , kitty .
goodnight .
hope it works .
leave it to me .
it' s just us .
b. o. q means .
bachelor officers ' quarters .
we went to six hotels , and they' re all against regulations ...
what' s the matter ?
billings is on the couch .
thompson and kay are in the bedroom .
what are they doing here ?
sleeping .
come on .
where ?
since time began , man has always found a place for his mate , even if it was a cave .
tonight , mankind' s a flop .
you haven' t a cave or even a bed ...
it' s 3 am and it' s my wedding night ...
my feet hurt , i couldn' t walk another step ...
yes , darling , yes .
do you want to sleep here ?
no .
i mean yes , but i want you to sleep here too .
you can bunk up with me and he can sleep in the bathroom .
sitting up ?
it' s not so bad .
i slept in a bathtub once .
on your wedding night ?
no .
i' il get you some blankets and a pillow .
come along , dear .
how could it turn out like this ?
i always planned a wonderful ...
i know , i know .
come on .
the bathroom' s there .
goodnight , henri .
good night , dear .
oh , everything' s wrong .
i can' t wear my new nightgown , there isn' t any rice ...
maybe kitty has some mothballs .
i don' t think it' s funny .
me , in one room and you , in a bathtub ...
yes , dear , but never mind .
goodnight , darling .
don' t cry , i' il be all right .
i' il be quite comfortable .
i' il just turn on the cold water .
come on , henri , hurry up .
we' ve a lot to do .
i am hurrying .
this is as fast as i can go .
straighten up , you look like a question mark .
thank you .
that' s better .
what a place to put a faucet , in the middle of my back .
it is unusual .
cheer up , tonight you' il have a bed to sleep on .
that' s just it .
i don' t mean to sound cranky , but this is so unnatural ...
i' il be at b. o. q and you' il be miles away .
all because the army ...
we haven' t time to look for somewhere else , we have to see the consul .
come on .
what are you doing in the gutter ?
where else would i be ?
i know it' s very important and you' re in a hurry , but it won' t be easy .
captain , have you any money in the us ?
no .
and the laws of your country only allow you to take a nominal amount .
yes , that' s right .
a visitor' s visa is no good , you couldn' t take a job .
and unless your wife can prove she' s able to support you , you couldn' t get a permanent visa .
catherine isn' t going to support me .
is there any other kind of visa ?
what about the french quota ?
it' s filled up for this year and next .
what' il we do ?
i was wondering if public law 271 would apply .
that' s the one regulating immigration of war brides .
catherine doesn' t have to immigrate , she' s an american citizen .
i was thinking of you as the bride .
that' s a good imagination you have there .
it says " spouses " , it doesn' t mention sex .
i' m convinced the american army doesn' t believe in it .
this is going to work .
yes , i think this will work .
sure it will .
this is wonderful .
what ?
spouses means mates .
it doesn' t say male or female .
we' re mates , right ?
i really wouldn' t know ...
you' re a spouse of a member of the american expedition .
therefore , you' re eligible to travel under section 271 , as her bride .
as her bride ?
henri ...
your bride ?
it' il be fun .
i know it' s ridiculous , but it' il work .
it' s the only way .
here' s the application .
i' m not going to travel as her bride .
besides , her name' s rochard .
excuse me , but officially , it' s still gates .
no , officially , it is rochard .
i have 3 certificates to prove it .
henri ...
i don' t care .
rochard .
rochard .
pay no attention .
what do we have to do ?
fill out your name , rank , organisation , wife' s maiden name ...
she hasn' t got a wife .
just for the time being .
have you got a wife ?
no , but it' s only a piece of paper .
obviously , these applications are intended for the husband .
i can write .
we know , dear .
you can write .
no , this doesn' t apply to you .
just make the proper adjustments .
what ?
on these papers .
you want to go , don' t you ?
well , it' s the only way .
hand them over to the immigration officer when you' ve filled them out .
thank you .
catherine ...
it' il be simple , you' il see .
on the contrary , turning a man into a woman is enormously complicated .
but , i' il do my best .
thank you , good day .
goodbye .
goodbye .
just a moment .
brides first .
i beg your pardon .
that' s all right .
hello , henri .
well , nothing happened .
hasn' t it come yet ?
i wonder if it even arrived .
i handed it to the immigration officer myself .
henri , brace yourself .
i' m leaving .
our whole outfit leaves tonight .
tonight ?
that does it .
we' re cooked .
the application will come this afternoon .
it won' t .
you' il go and i' il sit here , wondering which sex i am .
a marriage of solitary confinement .
i' ve never been so lonely .
if i have to leave you , i' il shoot myself .
shoot me too .
i think this is it .
it came to the office .
thank you , kitty .
at last ...
dear madam ...
that' s me .
following application of your husband ... " that' s you . " ... permission to enter the us as a war bride has been granted " .
i' ve got to go , see you later .
i' m so happy .
kiss me .
we' ve time , that can wait .
or maybe not .
no , henri , the letter .
please fill in a test form and bring to this office ...
another form .
will they ever run out ?
i won' t .
i won' t answer those questions .
this isn' t so bad .
i won' t answer those questions !
you' ve got to .
you don' t want to stay , do you ?
no .
then you' ve got to answer .
how can i ?
you can .
perhaps the man at the office will help you .
impossible .
control yourself and be nice .
everything will be all right .
read it on the way .
goodbye and good luck .
i tell you , there isn' t another form .
i told you first .
this form is for a woman .
on the other hand , if you don' t fill it out , you can' t go .
that' s right .
i' ve got to use this form .
i felt the same way , but if it' s the only form , let' s fill it out .
well , let' s see .
age and birth place , we' ve got .
are you an expectant mother ?
yes ...
how many months ?
20 .
20 ?
20 months ...
any female trouble ?
nothing but , sergeant .
have you had children before ?
my aching back ...
you know that awful feeling before breakfast ?
no , i don' t .
you' re lucky .
this doesn' t make any sense .
i know , but we' ve got to fill it out .
ask another , there are some good ones .
attention , please .
attention , please .
will mrs milton come to the desk , please ?
take seat 18 in bus number 3 .
mrs. rochard .
take seat 19 in bus number 3 .
thank you .
wait a minute .
you' re not mrs. rochard .
i' m mr. rochard .
it' s your wife who must report for transportation to bremerhaven .
according to the war department , i am my wife .
you can' t be your wife .
if the american army says i can be , who am i to dispute that ?
this is all wrong .
major , for your information , i am a war bride .
a war bride ?
i' m slightly confused .
i am a alien spouse of female personnel , en route to the us under public law 271 of the congress " .
this is a strange situation , but i suppose it' s legal .
yes , it is .
well , mrs ...
mr. rochard , it won' t be necessary for you to stop at the nurse' s desk .
no ?
attention , please .
all passengers must have their baggage checked before boarding .
all passengers must have their baggage checked before boarding .
mrs. turner , please come to the desk .
mrs. turner , please come to the desk .
he' s crying , the baby .
is that what he' s doing ?
he wants water , yes ?
i wouldn' t know .
when i want water , i ask for it differently .
he' s a baby .
you are a man .
thanks .
i' il get him some water .
you hold the baby .
i ...
i' il only be a minute .
i don' t know anything ...
oh , my god .
yes , yes ...
yes , yes ...
attention , please .
ladies , please stop moving and stay where you are till i finish .
this is the first leg of your journey to the us as guests of the army .
arrangements have been made for your comfort at the dependents hotel .
you' il be able to get all you need at the px there , such as lipstick , hairnets , garter belts , foundation garments ...
a lot of you have asked about the latest styles in the us .
hair is being worn shorter , close to the head .
skirts are long and rather hippy , the full blown look .
the trend is to the natural bust line .
between us , girls , looking around , i don' t think any of you need worry .
now , if you' il move out in order , the buses are ready .
happy journey , ladies .
he has to be here somewhere .
look .
henri , you look so maternal ...
what is that ?
a human fire extinguisher .
want to try ?
come on ...
he' s cute .
what' s his name ?
nigara .
henri , what a thing to do .
where' s the mother ?
she went to get more water .
she ought to get a plumber .
you' ve got to get out .
how can we ... ?
there' s the mother .
i' m sorry .
oh , darling ...
mr. rochard .
your seat on the bus has been changed .
you' re sitting with the driver .
i thought i could sit with you .
you can' t , kitty and i are flying .
the whole outfit' s going .
come on .
no !
i' il be there to meet you .
will we be together in bremenhaven ?
i hope so .
i' il try .
if not , i won' t sit with the driver .
do you want me to carry that ?
no , thank you ...
darling , was it bad ?
30 women .
with the exception of you , i may never talk with another .
poor henri ...
let' s get away .
where do we go ?
you don' t , henri .
i don' t ?
you couldn' t fix it ?
they wouldn' t hear of it .
i' m in building 11 and you stay here .
isn' t there any chance ?
i' ve argued for an hour .
i' m learning what it is to be a soldier' s wife .
i know , dear .
i feel the same way .
tomorrow on the boat , it' il be different .
i' ve got to go now .
come on , kitty .
i' il meet you on the dock tomorrow .
get a good night' s sleep .
that' s all i' il be getting .
hello and goodbye .
hello and goodbye , hello and goodbye ...
... your name on the list , you understand there' il be a wait , because we' ve a lot of people to attend to .
fill out the form and bring it back , and i' il see what i can do .
i' m sorry , visiting hours are over .
you can see your wife tomorrow .
my wife will have to visit me , i' m billeted here .
you are ?
but you can' t ...
lieutenant .
there must be some mistake .
no mistake .
i' m an alien spouse of female military personnel en route to the us , under public law 271 of the congress .
good grief .
the record shows 139 war brides , 126 children of war brides , 9 dogs , 3 cats , 2 canaries , one parrot ...
oh , yes .
here you are .
then , me .
you must' ve been added later .
one war bride , male " .
is that you ?
that' s me .
there' s a problem .
why ?
you can' t stay here .
i have to , i' m billeted here .
if you insist .
we already have 3 to 10 women in every room .
to say nothing of the dogs and cats .
i mean , you can' t stay here .
i can' t stay here .
the place for you is the officers ' billet in the staging area .
it won' t be half as interesting .
it' s just down the street , the third building on the left .
thank you very much .
thank you .
hello .
hello .
i suppose you wonder what i want here .
i will , if you want me to ...
i' m an alien spouse of female military personnel en route to the us , under public law 271 of the congress .
i' m a war bride .
no kidding ?
that' s interesting .
would it interest you enough to give me a bed ?
you can' t sleep here , mack .
why not ?
are you an american officer ?
no .
you can' t sleep here .
go to the dependents hotel .
i have just come from the dependents hotel .
the one in bremerhaven ?
i mean the one down at the staging area .
i' m too tired to walk all that distance .
suit yourself , mack , but you can' t sleep here .
there must be a bed that' s free .
you must have one , where is it ?
across the street .
my wife' s in it .
and you can' t ...
of course not .
quite right .
naturally .
well ...
oh , brother .
down this way .
this is awfully kind of you , sergeant .
i' m a private , but you' ve got to sleep somewhere .
you won' t get in trouble , will you ?
what can they do ?
bust me to civilian ?
it ain' t the ritz , but it should do .
it' s fine .
i' m grateful to find a friend like you .
where do you live ?
brooklyn .
i' il look you up when i get there .
get a good sleep .
no , thank you .
wake up .
no , thank you .
what are you doing here ?
i had a feeling .
i' m an alien spouse of female military personnel en route to the us , under public law 271 of the congress .
why aren' t you at the dependents hotel ?
i am writing a book about that .
you see , i' m not a woman .
that' s too bad .
but i tell you one thing : you can' t sleep here .
note i have not taken off my clothes in anticipation .
where will i go ?
i don' t know , but you ... ... can' t sleep here .
we' re agreed .
where will i go ?
the only place left is a german hotel , but you' re a dependent .
you come under military law and german hotels are out of bounds .
where will i go ?
i don' t know .
i' m sorry , but there' s an army rule and you ... ... can' t sleep here .
i beg your pardon .
where will you go ?
i don' t know .
it' s a shame .
if we was in brooklyn , you could' ve slept with the old man .
hiya .
oh , hi .
what can i do for you ?
i' m looking for a place to sleep .
can you help me ?
afraid not .
nothing but women sleeping in there .
i know , building 11 .
my wife' s in there .
a lot of people' s wives are in there .
have you ever noticed women always get a place to sleep .
why is that ?
i suppose it' s because they' re the weaker sex .
i believe they' re stronger .
do you know why ?
because they get enough sleep .
i' m sorry i can' t help you .
very kind of you , corporal .
good night .
are you from brooklyn ?
yonkers .
what are those ?
good night , buddy .
i' m am an alien spouse of female military personnel en route to the us , under public law 271 .
i' ve been all over looking for a place to sleep .
you poor man .
you can' t stay here .
this is a female building .
it is ?
another women' s building .
i' ve come to the conclusion that american men don' t sleep .
well , not in this building .
would there be any objection to me sitting here for a while ?
imagine i' m waiting for something .
it depends on what you imagine you' re waiting for .
i don' t want to send you out on a night like this .
very kind .
that' s nice .

boston , massachusetts .

i know .
my name is rochard .
you' il think i' m a bride , but actually i' m a husband .
there' il be some confusion , but if we keep our heads , it' il be fine .
i don' t think it will .
i' ve got a mrs. rochad on my list .
rochard .
she' s in a88 , with two brides and three children .
that will have to be altered .
not by me .
i' ve just explained to the army , they understood and passed you .
the army passed you .

i left something on the bus .
i' il have someone put it in the mess hall .

you' re not going to ... ?
i won' t do it .
it' il make a perfect wig .
and we' ve got the clothes .
i will not do it .
you said you loved me .
i' m not so sure .
you promised .
give me your knife .
come on , there' s not much time .
this is ridiculous .
can' t you at least cut it off the mane ?
you' re taking this too personally .
stand so no one can see .
it' s a little thick .
it won' t be so bad when i get your bangs rolled .
want to see ?
horrible .
i don' t think i' il have to defend my honour .
i doubt it .
a pity .
i wonder if some lipstick would help .
no .
why not ?
i' m the outdoor type .
seabiscuit , bangtail , you know .
silly .
hold still .
let me roll these .
wait , i forgot something .
can you talk like a woman ?
like this ?
awful .
can' t you do any better ?
no .
all right , then not a word , leave everything to me .
and keep your head down .
would you put this in the mess hall for me , please .
thank you .
wait a moment .
did you hear that ?
i must look pretty good .
don' t be silly , that was for me .
i ought to punch him in the nose .
remember , you' re a lady .
oh , yeah ...
we have our boarding cards .
we' ve been up before .
go ahead .
i don' t remember the tall one .
it' s hard to forget a face like that .
yeah .
lieutenant gates , b14 .
i was up before .
yes .
your orders , please .
this is funny .
rochard ...
why aren' t you listed among military personnel ?
save your voice , dear .
excuse her , she has laryngitis .
what was that ?
why isn' t she listed among the military personnel ?
she was just married .
that may be , but ...
red , come here .
what' s the trouble ?
this lieutenant' s listed as a mrs.
why did they put you down as ... ?
how do you do ?
why did they put you down as mrs instead of lieutenant ?
she has laryngitis , she can' t talk .
maybe it was because of her husband .
who did she marry ?
admiral rochard .
who ?
admiral rochard .
the name' s familiar , but i don' t remember an admiral .
you never heard of her husband ?
he won' t like that .
florence , if i were you , i wouldn' t say a word .
you heard him , red , admiral rochard .
yeah , maybe i have .
all right .
room a88 , lieutenant .
get your instructions in the mess hall .
thanks .
come , florence .
first time i ever felt sorry for an admiral .
cams aren' t bad .
now , i' m beginning to feel sorry for you .
in here , please .
we were ...
please , your instructions first .
come on , florence .
i don' t like that name .
shut up .
kitty ...
no ...
stand on the other side so they can' t see .
they wouldn' t let him on ...
henri , duck down .
i can hear .
you' re too tall .
duck down .
he looks awful .
i didn' t have much to work with .
have you got a room ?
yes , but they wouldn' t let a thing like that in .
we' ve got to hide him somewhere till the boat sails .
we better not stand here .
someone' s spotted him .
we need a nurse .
it' s an emergency .
will you come with me ?
i' m a nurse .
come along .
i hadn' t counted on this .
very lucky to find a nurse .
what' s the matter ?
my wife' s expecting a baby .
what ?
oh , no ...
it isn' t very convenient , is it ?
you can say that again .
it isn' t very convenient , is it ?
no , no it isn' t .
i wonder if it' il be a girl .
i' il be grateful if it' s a baby .
you will ?
you' re very kind .
i wish i knew what was going on .
you won' t have long to wait .
i won' t ?
gee whiz , i don' t think i can stand this .
you' ve got a bigger shock coming .
i have ?
she got dizzy .
thank you , i' il take care of her .
i' il get you some water .
pardon me .
this is the father .
how do you do .
is it a boy , or a girl ?
what happened to him ... ?
well , if it isn' t florence ...
arrest that man .
it' s all right , henri .
the ship has sailed .
come on , flo .
florence ...
may we come in ?
i don' t see how i can stop you , the key' s on the outside .
henri , this is lieutenant perkins and commander willis , the chaplain .
chaplain ?
oh , no ...
no , nothing doing .
i' m sorry , chaplain .
nothing doing what ?
no more marriages .
i won' t marry her again .
that won' t be necessary , mr. rochard .
everything' s straightened out .
sorry about the mix up , but your case was unusual .
you' re an alien spouse of female personnel en route to the us , under public law 271 of the congress .
am i now ?
under the circumstances , the captain would like to forget the whole thing .
don' t you understand ?
you' re free to go .
where ?
anywhere on the ship .
you' re bunked in with an officer .
he doesn' t mind .
i think he would mind .
he won' t like that .
i snore terribly .
you don' t snore .
how would you know ?
couldn' t we do something simple ?
couldn' t i just stay here ?
i suppose ...
i don' t see why not .
thank you , that' s very nice .
you' ve been a great help .
good night .
thank you very much .
you wouldn' t .
yes , i would .
i believe you would .
how will we ever get out of here ?
i' m not going to worry about that until i see the statue of liberty .
