greetings , my friend .
you are interested in the unknown ... the mysterious , the unexplainable .
that is why you are here .
and now , for the first time ... we are bringing you the full story ofwhat happened .
we are giving you all the evidence ... based only on the secret testimony of the miserable souls ... who survived this terrifying ordeal .
the incidents , places
my friend , we cannot keep this a secret any longer .
can your heart stand the shocking facts ... of the true story ... of edward d. wood , jr . ? .
1 5 .
we can' t hold the curtain any longer .
cripes , what am i gonna tell the cast ? .
it' s press night and there' s no press !
do you believe in ghosts ? .
nah , tommy .
that' s just kiddie spook stories .
onceyou' re dead , you stay dead .
i don' t kknow , bill .
out on that battlefield today , i saw this woman dressed in white ... floating above the dunes .
maybe it was just fatigue or maybe it' s the indignities ofwar .
ormaybe it' s somethin' else .
hey , i think i see somethin ' .
i offeryou mortals the bird of peace ... so that you may change your ways ... and end this destruction .
what a show !
evetyone was terrifiic .
paul , your second act monologue actually gave me the chills .
oh , thanks , eddie .
i got the early edition , hot off the presses !
this is the big moment .
oh , what does that old queen know ? .
she didn' t even show .
sent her copy boy to do the dirty work .
sc rew you , miss crowley .
do i really have a face like a horse ? .
what does " ostentatious " mean ? .
hey , it' s not that bad .
you can' t concentrate on the negative .
look , he' s got some nice things to say here .
the soldiers ' costumes are very realistic . " that' s positive !
rave of the century .
well , i' ve seen a lot worse reviews .
i' ve seen reviews where they didn' t even mention the costumes .
like that last francis the mule picture .
it got terrible notices .
huge hit !
lines around the block .
that' s right .
don' t take it too seriously .
we' re all doing great work .
do you really think so ? .
absolutely .
honey , what if i' m wrong ? .
what if i just don' t got it ? .
ed , it was only one review .
orson welles was only 26 when he made citizen kane .
i' m already 30 .
ed , you' re still young .
this is the time in your life when you' re supposed to be struggling .
i know .
but i' m scared it' s not going to get any better than this .
oh , i hate having to wake up this early .
gosh , where' s my pink sweater ? .
i can never seem to find my clothes any more .
hey , big shot !
get offyour ass and get this over to the executive building .
sure thing , mr kravitz .
hey , charlie , come here .
what did i tell ya about watering these plants , eh ? .
i want some water on ' em !
don' t sprinkle the damn things !
soak ' em !
hi .
all right , people , settle .
and ... action !
wow !
look at these camels !
these are real camels !
gosh , where' d they get real camels ? .
hey , you !
move it outta here , huh ? .
hey , eddie !
come in here .
i got some great new stuff to show you .
this is fantastic .
what are you gonna do with it ? .
probably file it away and never see it again .
ah , it' s such a waste .
why , if i had half the chance , i could make an entire movie using this stock footage .
the story opens on these mysterious explosions .
nobody knows what' s causing them , but it' s upsetting all the buffalo .
so the military are called in to solve the mystery .
you forgot the octopus .
no , no .
i' m saving that for my big underwater climax .
hello .
they say he was a girl trapped in a man' s body .
i bet it hurt when they cut his thing off .
ugh !
what are you ladies gabbin ' about ? .
you know that christine jorgensen freak ? .
he she it' s in variety .
some producer' s makin ' a biopic .
really ? .
i didn' t read that story .
yes , i' ve got mr edward wood on the line .
could you please hold ? .
mr weiss ? .
ed wood here .
listen , i heard about your new project and i was curious ifyou' d signed a directoryet .
oh , you haven' t !
well , ifwe could get together , i could explain to you ... why i' m more qualified to direct this than anyone else in town .
well , i' d rather not go into that over the phone .
all right .
great !
i' il see you then .
bye !
eddie , i don' t understand .
why are you the most qualified director for the christine jorgensen story ? .
oh , it' s just hogwash , hon .
i had to get into the door somehow .
no , i loveyou likke a brother .
no , no , no .
no , no , no .
that' s a fialsehood !
come in !
look , when i said you could have the western territories , i didn' t mean all 1 1 states !
i meant california , oregon , and what' s that one on top ? .
washington , yeah , yeah !
w oh , really ? .
well , screw you !
hi .
can i help you ? .
yes .
i' m ed wood .
i' m here about directing the christine jorgensen picture .
well , a couple of things have changed .
it ain' t gonna be the christine jorgensen story no more .
goddam variety had to print the story before i got the rights .
now that bitch is asking for the sky .
ah , you' re not gonna make the movie .
no , of course i' m gonna make the picture .
i already presold alabama and oklahoma .
those repressed okies , they go for that twisted , perverted stuff .
we' il just do it without the she male .
we' il fictionalize it .
is there a script ? .
fuck no .
but , there' s a poster .
it opens in nine weeks in tulsa .
well , mr weiss , look no further .
i' m your man .
i work fast and i' m a deal .
i write and direct .
and i' m good .
i just did a play in hollywood and victor crowley himself praised its realism .
there' s about 500 guys in this town that can say the same thing .
on the phone you said you had some special qualifications ? .
mr weiss ...
i have never told anyone ... what i' m about to tell you .
but i really want this job .
i like to dress in women' s clothing .
you' re a fruit ? .
no , not at all .
i love women .
wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them .
you' re not a fruit .
no , i' m all man .
i even fought in w. w ..
two .
of course , i was wearing women' s undergarments under my uniform .
ya got to be kidding me .
confidentially , i even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties .
i tell ya , i wasn' t scared of being killed , but i was terrified of getting wounded ... and having the medics discover my secret .
so you think this qualifies you to make my movie ? .
yes !
i know what it' s like to live with a secret ... and worry about what people are gonna think ofya .
my girlfriend still doesn' t know why her sweaters are always stretched out .
ed , you seem like a nice kid .
look around you .
i don' t hire directors with burning desires to tell their stories .
i make movies like chained girls .
i need someone with experience who can shoot a film in four days and make me a profit .
i' m sorty .
that' s all that matters .
can i get you anything else , kid ? .
too constrictive !
i can' t even fold my arms .
gee , mr lugosi , i' ve never had any complaints .
this is the most uncomfortable coffin i' ve ever been in .
your selection is quite shoddy .
you' re wasting my time !
mr lugosi ? .
i told you i don' t want any ofyour goddam coffins !
no , no !
i don' t work here .
then who are you ? .
what do you want ? .
i don' t want anything .
i' m just a really big , big fan .
i' ve seen all your movies .
mr lugosi , why are you buying a coffin ? .
i' m planning on dying soon .
no !
yes !
i' m embarking on another bus and truck tour of dracula .
twelve cities in ten days , if that' s conceivable .
do you know that i saw you perform dracula in poughkeepsie in 1 938 ? .
that was a terrible production .
renfield was a drunk !
i thought it was great .
you know , you' re much scarier in real life than you are in the movie .
thankyou .
i even waited outside to get your autograph , but you never came out .
well , i apologize .
when i play dracula , i put myself into a trance .
it takes me much time to reemerge .
oh , there' s my bus .
shit , where is my transfer ? .
say , don' t you have a car ? .
i refuse to drive in this country .
too many madmen .
i' ve got a car .
boy , mr lugosi , you must lead such an exciting life .
when is your next picture coming out ? .
i have no next picture .
you gotta be jokin ' .
a great star like you , you must have dozens of' em lined up .
back in the old days , yes .
but now , no one gives two fucks for bela .
but you' re a big star .
no more .
i haven' t worked in four years .
this business , this town , it chews you up , then spits you out .
i' m just an ex bogeyman .
make a right .
they don' t want the classic horror films any more .
today , it' s all giant bugs .
giant spiders , giant grasshoppers .
who would believe such nonsense ? .
the old ones were much spookier ; they had castles and full moons .
they were mythic .
they had a poetry to them .
yes .
and you know what else ? .
the women
the women prefer the traditional monsters .
the women .
huh .
the pure horror , it both repels and attracts them .
because in their collective unconsciousness ... they have the agony of childbirth .
the blood the blood is horror .
you know , i never thought of that .
take my word for it .
ifyou want to make out with a young lady ... you take her to see dracula .
eh , what a mess .
my wife of 20 years left me last month .
i' m not much of a housekeeper .
all right , i' m coming .
i' il feed you , my darlings .
i' d better get going .
but perhaps we could get together again some time , mr lugosi .
certainly .
but now , the children of the night are calling me .
uh [ nervous chuckle ]
good day .
good day .
sweetie , you won' t believe it .
i' ve got incredible news .
you got the job !
no , i didn' t get the job .
but something better happened .
better than not getting the job .
yes !
i met a movie star .
somebody really big .
who ? .
robert taylor ? .
no .
a horror movie star .
boris karloff ? .
close .
the other one .
you met ...
basil rathbone !
oh , to heck with you .
i met bela lugosi .
why , i thought he was dead .
no , he' s very much alive .
well ... sort of .
he' s old and frail , but he' s still bela lugosi and he' s really nice .
i can' t even remember the last time i saw him in a picture .
it' s a shame .
he' s such a great actor and no one uses him any more .
so , did you get his autograph ? .
no , it wasn' t like that at all .
it was just the two of us and we were talking .
he treated me like a friend .
yeah , well , he' s a bum .
no , he' s not .
do you have any idea how much money he made for this studio ? .
dracula , the blackk cat , the raven .
yeah ? .
well , now he' s a junkie .
he don' t deserve to work .
that is not true !
he' s so great , you hire him .
yeah , well , i would if i could .
trickk ortreat !
the house lookks likke they have lots ofikkids .
ooh , those eyes .
he gives me the willies .
uh , i hate it when she interrupts the picture .
she doesn' t show ' em the proper respect .
i think she' s a honey .
look at those jugs .
but he stood me up at the restaurant .
i guess i shouldn' t have picked a steakk house .
and then i went out with the wolfiman .
ugh !
what an evening .
i didn' t kknow whether to kkiss him good night  vampira ... you will come under my spell .
you will be my slave of love .
my gosh , bela !
how do you do that ? .
you must be double jointed .
and you must be hungarian .
vampira , look at me .
look into my eyes .
you' re watching our halloween movie , white zombie ... starring bela lugosi , john harron , madge bellamy ... and a bunch of other people i' ve never heard of .
i' m very tired .
i need to take my medicine .
do you want me to get it foryou ? .
no .
thankyou , eddie .
i' il be all right .
oh , shit .
i feel much better !
children !
i love children !
trick or treat !
aren' t you scared , little boy ? .
i' m going to drink your blood .
you' re not a real vampire .
those teeth don' t firighten me .
how about these ? .
hey , how' d you do that ? .
dentures .
lost my pearlies in the war .
so , what was the important newsyou couldn' t tell me on the phone , again ?
i started thinking about what you were saying about how your movies need to make a profit .
what is the one thing , ifyou put it in a movie , it' il be successful ? .
tits .
no , better than that .
a star .
kid , you must have me confused with david selznick .
i don' t make major motion pictures ; i make crap .
yes !
but ifyou take that crap and put a star in it , then you' ve got something .
yeah .
crap with a star .
no , something better !
something impressive .
maybe the biggest money maker you' ve ever had .
fine , all right .
you may be right , but it doesn' t frickin ' matter .
i can' t afford a star , so what are we even talkin ' about ? .
all right .
what if i told you you could have a star for $1, 000 ? .
who ? .
lugosi ?
yes !
lugosi !
isn' t he dead ? .
no , he' s not dead .
he lives in baldwin hills .
i met him recently and he really wants to be in our movie .
why would lugosi want to do a sex change flick ? .
because he' s my friend !
all right , fine !
you can direct it .
i want a script in three days .
we start shooting a weekk firom monday .
mr weiss , thank you so much .
you won' t regret it .
i won' t let you down .
but bunny , you' re perfect for this job .
you know these people .
i need all the transsexuals and transvestites i can get .
no , i don' t care if they' re not actors .
i want realism !
i want this film to tell the truth .
coming !
i' ve waited all my life for this shot , and i' m not gonna blow it .
eddie , you got a new movie for me , eh ? .
yes !
it' s gonna be a great picture and you' il love your character .
have a seat .
listen , bunny ? .
bela' s here .
i gotta go .
listen , hit the bars , work some parties , and get me transvestites !
i need transvestites !
all right .
bye .
eddie , what kind of a movie is this ? .
well , it' s about how people have two personalities : the side they show to the world , and then the secret person they hide inside .
like jekyil and hyde .
i' ve always wanted to play jekyil and hyde .
i' m looking forward to this production .
well , your part' s a little different .
you' re like the god that looks over all the characters and oversees everything .
i don' t understand .
you control everyone' s fate .
you' re like the puppetmaster .
ah , so i pull the strings !
yes , you pull the strings .
pull the strings .
i like that !
honey !
i got a little surprise foryou .
wipe offyour hands .
i finished my script .
oh !
ed , i' m so proud ofyou !
i' il read it as soon as i get home .
well , i' d really like to know what you think .
why don' t you go in the bedroom and take a look ? .
i' il wait .
go ahead .
take your time .
so that' s where my sweater' s been .
how long have you been doing this ? .
since i was a kid .
my mom wanted a girl , so she used to dress me in girlie clothing .
just became a habit .
jesus christ !
and you never told me ? .
well , this is my way of telling you .
what , by putting it in a fucking script for everyone to see ? .
what kind of sick mind operates like that ? .
and what about this , this so called barbara character ... that' s obviously me ? .
i mean , this is our life .
it' s so embarrassing !
of course it is .
that' s why you should play the part .
oh , you got nerve , buddy .
it' s a darn good role .
that' s not the issue !
god , how can you act so casual when you' re dressed like that ? .
it makes me feel comfortable .
oh , just like in the script .
exactly .
so , what do you say ? .
do we break up ? .
or do you want to make the movie with me ? .
they make you tall , and you' re flashy .
they want that .
okay .
but they want professionalism , so nix on the nelly ... without losing naivete , okay ? .
now , the good news isyou' re probably going to get hired becauseyou lookk likke peggy lee .
but i don' t want anybody else to resent that , okay ? .
please ? .
' cause there' s enough for everybody , exotics too .
all right , because ifyou' re not going to smile , please don' t bother .
you' il embarrass me .
this is george weiss .
he' s done some very important things ; he' s a nice person to know .
an important person to know .
i thought you were gonna make a sex change film !
it' s still a sex change film .
yeah !
five pages before it ends !
the rest is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters !
i don' t think he' s a schmuck .
what about this title ? .
my poster says , i changed my sex ..
so change the poster .
trust me , you' il be better off .
this story' s gonna grab people .
it' s about this guy , he' s crazy about this girl , but he likes to wear dresses .
should he tell her ? .
should he not tell her ? .
he' s torn .
this is drama !
fine !

just make sure it' s seven reels long .
testing .

but when it' s over , we' il have a picture that' il entertain , enlighten ... and maybe even move millions ofipeople .

ifyou look good and you talk well , people will swallow anything .
we are going to have the most terrifying monster ever seen on film .
a ghastly creature created from an atomic mutation !
i don' t like scary movies .
i like the ones with love stories .
that' s just what this movie is : a heartbreaking romance .
you' re quite a specimen .
and you' re going to be in the picture ? .
yeah .
i play lobo .
i predict bride ofitheatom will be the biggest moneymaker of all time .
and this is lovely starlet dolores fuller , who will playjanet lawton .
my pleasure , ma' am .
now , how much will this picture cost ? .
well , in a normal studio it' d be about a million bucks ... with all their wasteful overhead and fancy offices .
but we' re more efficient , so we could bring it in at about 70 grand .
oh .
well , i shall certainly consider it .
well , goodbye .
good night , ed .
keep in touch .
goodbye .
well , eddie , how' d we do ? .
we didn' t make a nickel .

i' m a producer .
really ? .
wow !
i would love to be involved in that .
is that right ? .
well , maybe i can help you out .
have you ever thought about investing in a motion picture ? .
perhaps a small amount of money .
how much do your motion pictures cost ? .
well , my new one , i think , would be about $60, 000 .
that' s all ? .
that seems very reasonable for an entire picture .
would you would you like to , uh ...
have a look at the at the photoplay ? .
oh , sure .
oh , my .
this is very interesting .
say , do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts ? .
oh , you want to be an actress too .
well , of course .
there' s a couple of parts i can think of right now that you might be perfect for .
there' s , uh , the secretary in the newspaper office , the file clerk , um
hmm .
those sound kind of small .
here' s one that looks good janet lawton .
i' d sure likke to play her .
janet lawton .
yes .
janet lawton is clearly the part to play .
can' t you just see me in the part ? .
yes !
you' d be perfect .
you bastard !
you two timing , dress wearing son of a bitch !
honey , it was the only way i could get the movie made !
who do you think' s been paying the rent ? .
who' s been helping you type your scripts and do all your grunt work ? .
i am sorry !
what did you want me to say ? .
you were supposed to say ...
no .
i wrote that part for my girlfriend dolores !
snowball , there are plenty of other parts .
like what ? .
the secretary , the file clerk .
aaaaah !
you ... asshole !
this is gonna be bela' s laboratory , so it should be real impressive ... just like one of those " mad scientist " movies .
i want test tubes , beakers and one of those electrical things that buzzes .
you mean a tesla coil ? .
fine .
whatever .
hop to it !
right !
right .
eddie ? .
yes ?
which dress do you like better ? .
hmm .
i don' t know .

which one is the red one ? .
what do you mean ? .
i mean , i can' t see the difference ; i' m colour blind .

at universal , we used to shoot one ortwo scenes a day .

loretta , tor , i wanna explain this scene ; it' s a little complicated , but
bela , you' il be sitting there .

one of them burned me on the return ofichandu .
all right .
then you' il be sitting there .

great .
all right , gang , here' s the scene .
loretta , you' re in a trance ; you glide in and get on the operating table .
now , tor , you' re supposed to tie her down , but you have an angora fetish ... and when you rub that swatch of angora , it makes you refuse .
so then bela has to discipline you .
all right ? .

i' il teach you to disobey me !
aaaargh !

i am terribly sorry to bother you while you' re shooting ... but the guy that owns the stage needs his money .
well , then , you should pay him , shouldn' t you ? .
yes .
exactly .
i kind of need it now .
w what are you looking at me like that for ? .
i already gave you my three hundred .
right .
and now i need the other sixty thousand .
what other sixty thousand ? .
the other sixty thousand you said you' d give to me .
you misunderstood , eddie .
i gave you everything i have in the world three hundred dollars .
well , here we go again .
let me tell ya , ya can' t lose .
it' s scary .
and ifyou don' t like that , it' s romantic .
bela lugosi will portray dr eric vornoff .
and lovely , lovely , lovely ingenue loretta king ... is reporter janet lawton .
i don' t know .
lugosi looks pretty old .
huh ? .

i don' t want you to show the movie , i want you to be in it .
let me explain .
we started shooting , but after three days we got shut down .

so i thought perhaps you' d like to come over just to say " howdy " to some of the backers .
look , i' m with some friends and we' re about to eat .

it would just take one second .
come over and meet the backkers .
there is a really nice dentist firom ox . nard .

i' m getting a bad feeling about this .
let' s get out of here .

now , that was a premiere .
eddie ...
last night was quite a romp .
did you see that kid grab vampira' s boobies ? .
i envied him .
hell , i envied you too .
a girlfriend who would jump in front of a car like that .
yes , she is quite something .
none of my wives would have .
eddie , i want to thankyou .
these last few days have been ... a good time .
you know , i just
i just wish you coulda seen the movie .
ahh .
no problem .
i know it by heart .

i have no home .

despised .
living like an animal .

why , that was that was incredible .
i mean , you' re just as great as you ever were .

when the brain is young ... the spirit is still ... vigorous ...
iike like a young man .
and left the planet mars ... never to return again .
the end .
mmm .
wood productions .
hey , who' s crazy idea was it to bury him in the cape ? .
i heard it was in the will ; it was how he wanted to be remembered .
could you run it again ? .
mr wood .
huh ?
uh , mr wood , this is mr reynolds , your landlord .
could you please open up ? .
one minute .
yes ? .
uh , mr wood , you have bounced your third and final rent cheque .
i' m terribly sorry .
my my stockbroker must' ve transferred the wrong account .
come on in .
i' il write you another cheque .
ahh .
i see you' re in the picture business .
yes .
i' m interested in the picture business .
my associates and i , we wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films ... about the apostles .
but unfortunately , we don' t have enough money .
well , raising money' s tough .
no , our church has enough money for one film .
we just don' t have enough for all twelve .
well , you know what you do ? .
you produce a film in a commercially proven genre ... and then after it' s a hit , you take the profits from that and make the 1 2 apostles movies .
would that work ? .
absolutely .
let me show you something .
you see this script ? .
grave robbers from outerspace .
money in the bank .
grave robbers from what ? .
from outer space .
it' s science fiction .
very big with the kids .
ifyou make this picture , you' il have enough money to finance a hundred religious films ... and pay my back rent with the profits .
i don' t know .
this is , um , all a lot to absorb .
it' s a guaranteed blockbuster .
mmm .
i understand this science fiction is very popular , but , um ... don' t the big hits always have big stars ? .
well , we have a big star bela lugosi .
bela lugosi
oh , i thought he passed on .
yes .
yes , he did .
but ...
i' ve got the last footage he ever shot .
doesn' t look like very much .
mr reynolds , this is the acorn that will grow a great oak .
i' il just get a double to finish his scenes ... and we' il release it as bela lugosi' s final film .
bunny ? .
we' re makin ' another movie .
yes , i got the baptist church of beverly hills to put up the cash .
ed , i got the lugosi doubles outside .
bunny , i gotta go .
he' s too short .
he' s too tall .
he' s just not going to work .
well , ed , i was thinkin ' like when bela played fu manchu .
paul , that was karloff .
oh .
you' re gonna have to try harder .
okay .
try to be a cut above .
go get ' em .
okay .
right .
keep sunday open ; the producers want us to get baptised .
okay .
you know , hon , when you rewrite a script , it just gets better and better .
this is the ultimate ed wood movie .
no compromises .
oh , my .
eddie , lookk at this .
hmm ?
what ? .
poor girl' s out of a job .
i brought the script .
you' il be portraying the ghoul' s wife .
the ghoul' s wife ? .
yes .
you should feel lucky .
eddie' s the only fella in town who doesn' t pass judgement on people .
that' s right .
if i did , i wouldn' t have any friends .
look , would it be possible to make the ghoul' s wife a little less prominent ...
so people wouldn' t really notice me in the movie ? .
you don' t want to be noticed ? .
yeah .
how about this ? .
what if i don' t have any lines ? .
i' il play the part mute .
mute ? .
hey , it' s dr tom .
dr tom !
hiya !
who' s dr tom ? .
he' s my chiropractor .
hey , kathy .
how are you ? .
fine , thanks .
well , look at you .
you' re looking in alignment today .
well , actually , my neck is a little funny .
now , here , let me fix that .
ooh !
my gosh !
don' t move .
it' s uncanny .
look at his head !
it' s uncanny !
lift up your voice
and let us sing
alleluia , alleluia
he look nothin ' like bela .
he' s kinda got his ears .
oh , look .
coveryour face with this .
oh .
now i can see it .
i want to suck your blood .
i want to suck your blood !
let' s hearyou call boris karloff a cocksucker .
shh !
we want these baptists to like us .
please .
alleluia
brothers and sisters ... we reach now in the service a joyous point ... because we are going to bear witness to the baptism of our new members .
why couldn' t we do this in the church ? .
because brother tor couldn' t fit in the sacred tub .
welcome to the fold , brother .
do you accept jesus christ as your personal saviour ? .
yes !
in the name of the father , the son and the holy ghost .
amen .
welcome to the fold , brother .
welcome .
praise the lord , brother .
do you reject satan and all his evils ? .
sure .
in the name of the father , the son and the holy ghost .
praise the lord , firiends !
do you repent fior allyour sins ?
i do .
how do you do it ? .
how do you get all your friends to get baptised ...
just so you can make a monster movie ? .
it' s not a monster movie .
it' s a supernatural thriller .
come tojesus , brother !
i can' t believe this .
ed , what am i gonna do here ? .
what do you mean ? .
he has no hair .
gee , i never noticed that .
put a wig on him !
before we start shooting , mr wood , we have a few questions .
yes .
the script contains numerous references to grave robbing .
now , we find the concept of digging up consecrated ground to be highly offensive .
it is blasphemy .
what are you talking about ? .
it' s the premise of the movie .
it' s the title of the movie , for christ' s sakes !
mr wood !
yes , about that title .
it strikes us as very inflammatory .
why don' t we change it to plan 9 from outerspace ?
ha !
that' s ridiculous .
all right .
and , action !
medical examiner been around yet ? .
just left .
the morgue wagon oughta be along most any time .
you get their statement ? .
yeah , but they' re pretty scared .
fine mess like this will frighten anyone .
you have one ofithe boys , uh ... takke the guy and the girl backk to town ; you takke charge .
what' d you give him all the lines for ? .
he' s unintelligible .
lugosi' s dead and vampira won' t talk ; i had to give somebody the dialogue !
that is no answer !
what about glitter ? .
when i was a headliner in paris , audiences always liked it when i sparkled .
no !
cat' s eyes !
no !
well , i' m going to need some antennae .
no !
you' re the ruler of the galaxy !
show a little taste !
see ?
no talking .
isn' t he good ?
cue dr tom .
n now ?
yes , now .
lurk him .
be sure and keep your face covered .
isn' t it wonderful ? .
bela lives .
doesn' t it strike you as a bit morbid ? .
no .
he would' ve loved it .
bela' s returned from the grave .
just like dracula .
cue vampira .
cut !
let' s go down and fiind out whose grave it is .
oh , why do i always get hooked up with these spook details ? .
monsters , graves , bodies !
cue flying saucer .
and cut !
print .
we' re moving on .
that was perfect .
perfect ? .
mr wood ... do you know anything about the art of film production ? .
well , i like to think so .
that cardboard headstone tipped over .
this graveyard is obviously phoney .
nobody will ever notice that .
filmmaking is not about the tiny details .
it' s about the big picture .
the big picture ?
yes .
how about when the policemen arrived in daylight , but now it' s suddenly night ? .
what do you know ? .
haven' t you heard of suspension of disbelief ? .
reverend , i' m here .
oh .
who is he ? .
this is our choir director .
he' s gonna play the young hero .
are you people insane ? .
i' m the director !
i make the casting decisions around here !
i thought this was a group effort .
no !
no ? .
they' re driving me crazy !
these baptists are ... stupid , stupid , stupid !
okay .
i gotta calm down .
gotta calm down .
gotta calm down .
take a deep breath .
relax .
all right , everybody .
let' s get set up for scene 1 1 2 .
move the crypt stage left , and let' s get tor' s make up effect ready .
mr wood !
what do you think you' re doing ? .
i' m directing .
not like that you' re not !
remove that get up immediately !
you shame our lord .
that' s it !
i can' t take it !
take me to the nearest bar , and make it snappy !
imperial whisky .
oh , my gosh .
orson welles .
excuse me , sir ? .
yes ? .
um well , i' m a young filmmaker and a real big fan .
i i just wanted to meet you .
my pleasure .
i' m orson welles .
i' m , uh , edward d. wood, jr .
what you working on ? .
well , the financing just fell through for the third time on don quix . ote .
you know , i can' t believe it .
that sounds just exactly like my problems .
it' s the damn money men .
they never know who' s a windbag and who' s got the goods .
then they all think they' re directors .
ain' t that the truth ? .
do you know that i' ve even had producers re cut my movies ? .
i hate when that happens .
and they' re always ttying to cast their buddies .
it doesn' t even matter if they' re right for the part .
tell me about it .
i' m supposed to do a thriller at universal ... but they want charlton heston to play a mexican .
ah , mr welles .
is it all worth it ? .
it is when it works .
you know , the one film of mine where i had total control , kane ? .
the studio hated it ... but they didn' t get to touch a firame .
ed .
yes ? .
visions are worth fiighting fior .
why spendyour lifie making someone else' s dreams ?
thank you ...
orson .
mr reynolds .
yes .
we are gonna finish this picture just the way i want it ... because you cannot compromise an artist' s vision .
but it' s our money .
and you' re gonna make a bundle ... but only ifyou shut up and let me do things my way .
all right , gang .
actors in positions .
let' s finish this picture .
action .
wanna give him a hand ? .
keep rolling .
now that' s an alien .
action .
what plan will you follow now ? .
plan 9 .
plan 9 ? .
ah , yes .
plan 9 deals with the resurrection of the dead .
long distance electrodes shot into the pineal and pituitary glands ... of the recent dead .
you know , maybe you guys were right .
plan 9 " is a good title .
i want that lightning , i want those two explosions ...
and i' ve got to have more shots of the military !
right .
and cut .
all right , friends .
prepare for scene 32 .
m mr. wood ? .
yeah ? .
where' s the cockpit set ? .
you' re standing in it .
places !
but what ifwe develop this solenite bomb ? .
then we' d be a stronger nation too .
stronger .
you see ? .
you see ? .
your stupid minds .
stupid .
stupid !
that' s all i' m gonna take outta you !
oh !
cut !
action .
greetings , my friend .
we are all interested in the future ... for that is where you and i are going to spend the rest of our lives .
future events such as these will effect you in the future .
and ... cut !
that' s a wrap .
oh !
i can' t get it up .
it' s stuck .
eddie , you' re gonna be late for your own premiere .
all right , forget it .
ladies and gentlemen .
you are about to see an extraordinary motion picture .
but befiore it begins , i thinkk we should all give a hand to the man ... without whom we wouldn' t be here tonight .
eddie , take a bow !
thank you .
i just wanna say that this film ... is for bela .
the griefiofihis wifie' s death ... became greater and greater agony .
the home they had so long shared together ... became a tomb a sweet memoty ofiherjoyous living .
the skky to which he had once lookked ... was now only a covering fior her dead body .
the ever beautifiul filowers she had planted ... with her own hands ... became nothing more than the lost roses ofiher cheekks .
confiused by his great loss ... the old man left that home ... never to return again .
this is the one .
this is the one i' il be remembered for .
aw , gee , honey , i' m so happy for ya !
say , let' s get married .
huh ? .
right now .
let' s go to vegas .
but , eddie , it' s pouring , and the car top is stuck .
phooey !
it' s only a five hour drive ... and it' il probably stop by the time we get to the desert .
heck , it' il probably stop by the time we get around the corner .
let' s go .
oh !
