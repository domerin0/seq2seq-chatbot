mozart !
forgive your assassin !
i confess , i killed you !
s , i killed you , mozart .
piet !
mozart , piet !
forgive your assassin !
forgive me , mozart !
signore salieri , open the door , be good now !
signore , we have something special for you .
something you' re going to love .
is that good !
signore , believe me ... ... this is the most delicious thing i ever ate in my life !
really , you don' t know what you' re miss
all right , that' s enough , open the door .
signore , if you don' t open this door ... ... we' re going to eat everything and leave nothing for you .
and i' m never going to come and see you again !
good morning , father .
herr salieri ?
leave me alone .
i can' t leave alone a soul in pain .
do you know who i am ?
that makes no difference .
all are equal in god' s eyes .
are they ?
offer me your confession .
i can offer you god' s forgiveness .
how well are you trained in music ?
i know a little .
i studied it in my youth .
where ?
here in vienna .
then , you must know this .
i can' t say that i do .
what is it ?
it was a very popular tune in its day .
i wrote it .
here , how about this ?
this one brought down the house .
i regret it is not too familiar .
can you recall no melody of mine ?
i was the most famous composer in europe .
i wrote forty operas alone .
here !
what about this one ?
yes , i know that !
that' s charming !
i' m sorry , i didn' t know you wrote that .
i didn' t .
that was mozart .
wolfgang ... ... amadeus mozart .
the man you accuse yourself of killing .
you' ve heard that ?
is it true ?
for god' s sake , my son ... ... if you have something to confess ... ... do it now .
give yourself some peace .
he ... ... was my idol .
mozart .
i can' t think of a time when i didn' t know his name .
i was playing childish games ... ... when he was playing music for kings and emperors .
even the pope in rome .
i admit , i was jealous ... ... when i heard the tales they told about him .
not of the brilliant little prodigy ... ... but of his father , who had taught him everything .
my father , he did not care for music .
when i told him ... ... how i wished i could be like mozart ... ... he would say , " why ?
do you want to be a trained monkey ?
you' d like me to drag you around europe , doing tricks like a circus freak ?
how could i tell him ... ... what music meant to me ?
while my father prayed earnestly to god ... ... to protect commerce ... ... i would offer up ... ... secretly ... ... the proudest prayer a boy could think of .
lord ... ... make me a great composer .
let me celebrate your glory through music ... ... and be celebrated myself .
make me famous through the world , dear god .
make me immortal .
after i die ... ... let people speak my name with a love for what i wrote .
in return ... ... i will give you my chastity ... ... my industry ... ... my deepest humility , every hour of my life .
amen .
and do you know what happened ?
a miracle !
my life changed forever .
of course i knew god had arranged it all .
that was obvious .
one minute i was a frustrated boy ... ... in an obscure little town ... ... the next i was here ... ... in vienna , city of musicians ... ... and emperor joseph , the musical king .
in a few years , i was his court composer .
isn' t that incredible ?
every night i sat right next to the emperor of austria ... ... playing duets with him ... ... correcting the royal sight reading .
actually , the man had no ear at all .
but what did it matter ?
he adored my music .
everybody liked me .
i liked myself .
until he came .
he came to vienna to play some of his music ... ... at the residence of his employer , the prince archbishop of salzburg .
eagerly , i went there to seek him out .
that night ... ... changed my life .
as i wandered through the salon ... ... i played a little game with myself .
this man had written his first concerto at the age of 4 ... ... his first symphony at 7 ... ... a full scale opera at 12 !
did it show ?
is talent like that ... ... written on the face ?
which one of them ... ... could he be ?
mozart is not here .
stop it !
i am .
i am stopping it .
i' m stopping it .
slowly .
there .
you see ?
i' ve stopped .
now we' re going back .
no !
you don' t know where you are .
here , everything goes backwards .
people walk and dance and sing backwards ... ... and even talk backwards .
that' s stupid .
why , people fart backwards .
say i' m sick !
say i' m sick !
yes , you are .
you are very sick .
say it backwards , shit wit !
saa i' m sick ....
sick ... kiss .
i' m ... my saa .
kiss my ass .
eem iram !
eem iram !
i' m not playing this game !
say it , it' s serious .
it' s very serious .
iram .
marry eem ... marry me .
i' m not going to marry you .
you' re a fiend .
ooy vol l tub ....
tub ... ... but i ....
volv ... love .
but i love you ?
tish i' m tee .
what ?
tee ... eat .
eat .
i' m .
my .
tish .
eat my shit .
you filthy fiend !
my music .
they' ve started without me .
that ... ... was mozart !
that giggling , dirty minded creature i' d just seen ... ... crawling on the floor ....
i think that went off remarkably well .
don' t you ?
these viennese know good music when they hear it , don' t you think ?
certainly .
your grace .
why ?
why what , sir ?
why must i be humiliated ... ... in front of my guests , by one of my own servants ?
the more license i allow you , the more you take .
if his grace is not satisfied with me , he can dismiss me .
i wish you to return immediately to salzburg .
your father is waiting for you there .
no , your grace !
with all humility , i prefer you dismiss me .
obviously , i don' t satisfy .
i have no intention of dismissing you .
you will remain in my service and learn your place .
on the page it looked ... ... nothing !
the beginning , simple ... ... almost comic .
just a pulse .
bassoons , basset horns ... ... like a rusty squeezebox .
and then , suddenly ... ... high above it ... ... an oboe .
a single note , hanging there , unwavering .
until ... ... a clarinet took it over ...
... sweetened it into a phrase of such delight .
this was no composition by a performing monkey .
this was a music i had never heard .
filled with such longing , such unfulfillable longing .
it seemed to me that i was hearing the voice of god .
excuse me .
but why ?
why would god choose an obscene child to be his instrument ?
he' s remarkable , majesty .
i heard an extraordinary opera of his last month .
idomoneo , king of crete .
that ?
a most tiresome piece .
i heard it too .
tiresome ?
a young man trying to impress beyond his abilities .
too much spice .
too many notes .
majesty ... ... i thought it the most promising work i' ve heard in years .
well then , we should make some effort to acquire him .
we could use a good german composer in vienna , surely ?
i' m sure he could be tempted with the right offer .
say , an opera in german for our national theatre .
excellent , sire !
but not german .
i beg your majesty .
italian is the proper language for opera .
all educated people agree on that .
what do you think , chamberlain ?
in my opinion , sir , it' s time we had a piece in our own language .
plain german for plain people .
kapellmeister ?
majesty ... ... i must agree with herr direktor .
german is ...
... too brute for singing .
court composer ... ... what do you think ?
i think it' s an interesting notion to keep mozart in vienna .
it should infuriate the archbishop beyond measure ... ... if that is your majesty' s intention .
you are cattivo , court composer .
i want to meet this young man .
chamberlain , arrange a welcome for him .
well ... there it is !
this is a beautiful wig for you .
it looks so marvelous ... ... and i love it .
the other one .
here is the other one .
i think you will love it .
here' s the third one .
so ?
here we go .
how do you like it ?
they' re all so beautiful .
why don' t i have three heads ?
this is funny !
three heads !
gentlemen ... ... good morning .
what do you have for me today ?
your majesty , herr mozart .
yes , what about him ?
he' s here .
well , there it is .
good !
your majesty , i hope you won' t find it improper ... ... but i' ve written a little march of welcome in his honor .
what a charming idea , court composer .
may i see ?
just a trifle .
may i try it ?
let' s have some fun .
delightful , court composer !
may i play it when he enters ?
you do me too much honor .
bring in herr mozart .
but slowly , slowly .
i need a minute to practice .
good .
continue .
g , " majesty .
excellent !
very good .
very good , majesty .
tempo !
up !
lightly , then strongly !
the march , majesty .
again .
bravo , majesty !
gentlemen , please .
a little less enthusiasm , i beg you .
no , please .
please !
it' s not a holy relic .
you know , we have met before .
in this very room .
perhaps you don' t recall .
you were only 6 .
he was giving a most delightful concert !
as he got off the stool , he slipped and fell .
my own sister antoinette helped him up .
and do you know what he did ?
he jumped into her arms and said , " will you marry me ?
yes or no ?
you know all these gentlemen , i' m sure .
the baron van swieten .
i' m a great admirer of yours .
thank you .
kapellmeister bonno .
the director of opera , count orsini rosenberg .
sir , yes .
the honor is mine , absolutely !
here is our illustrious court composer ... ... maestro salieri .
at last , such immense joy !
diletto straordinario !
i know your work well , signore .
you know , i actually composed some variations on a melody of yours .
really ?
which one ?
mio caro adone .
i' m flattered .
a funny little tune , but it yielded some good things .
and now he has returned the compliment .
herr salieri composed this little march of welcome for you .
really ?
well , there it is .
down to business .
young man ... ... we' re going to commission an opera from you .
what do you say ?
did we vote in the end for german or italian ?
actually , sire , if you remember , we did finally incline to italian .
did we ?
i don' t think it was really decided , your majesty .
please let it be german !
why so ?
because i' ve already found the most wonderful libretto .
have i seen it ?
i don' t think you have , herr direktor .
not yet .
it' s quite new .
i' il show it to you immediately , of course .
i think you' d better .
tell us about it .
tell us the story .
it' s quite amusing .
the whole thing is set in a ....
yes ?
where ?
in a harem , majesty .
in a seraglio .
you mean in turkey ?
yes , exactly .
then why especially does it have to be in german ?
it doesn' t , especially .
it could be in turkish if you really want .
no , dear fellow ... ... the language is not finally the point .
do you really think that subject is appropriate for a national theatre ?
why not ?
it' s charming .
i won' t actually show concubines exposing their ....
it' s not indecent .
it' s highly moral , majesty .
it' s full of proper german virtues !
excuse me , majesty , but what do you think these could be ?
as a foreigner , i' d love to learn .
tell him , mozart .
name us a german virtue .
love , sire .
love !
of course , in italy we know nothing about love .
no , i don' t think you do .
i mean , watching italian opera , all those male sopranos screeching ... ... fat couples rolling their eyes about .
that' s not love .
it' s rubbish !
majesty , you choose the language .
it will be my task to set it to the finest music ... ... ever offered a monarch .
well , there it is .
let it be german .
this is yours .
keep it , if you want .
it' s already here in my head .
what ?
on one hearing only ?
i think so , sire .
show us .
the rest is just the same , isn' t it ?
doesn' t really work , does it ?
did you try ... ?
shouldn' t it be a bit more ... ?
or this ?
yes .
better ?
what do you think ?
all i ever wanted ... ... was to sing to god .
he gave me that longing ... ... and then made me mute .
why ?
tell me that .
if he didn' t want me to praise him with music ... ... why implant the desire ... ... like a lust in my body ?
and then deny me the talent ?
madame cavalieri is here for her lesson .
maestro !
how do you like it ?
it' s turkish .
my hairdresser said that everything this year' s going to be turkish .
does he ?
what else did he tell you today ?
come , come !
give me some gossip .
i heard you met herr mozart .
news travels fast in vienna .
and he' s been commissioned to write an opera .
is it true ?
yes .
is there a part in it for me ?
no .
how do you know ?
do you know where it' s set , my dear ?
where ?
in a harem .
what' s that ?
a brothel .
come !
let' s begin .
what does he look like ?
mozart ?
you might be disappointed .
why ?
looks and talent don' t always go together , caterina .
looks don' t concern me , maestro .
only talent interests a woman of taste .
shall we continue ?
there she was !
i don' t know where they met or how .
there she stood !
on stage , for all to see .
showing off like the greedy songbird she was .
ten minutes of ghastly scales .
arpeggios !
whizzing up and down like fireworks at a fairground .
understand , i was in love with the girl .
or at least in lust .
i swear , i never ... ... laid a finger on her .
all the same ... ... i couldn' t bear to think of anyone else touching her ... ... least of all , the creature .
brava , madame !
you are an ornament to our stage .
your majesty .
well , herr mozart !
a good effort .
well , decidedly that !
an excellent effort .
you have shown us something ... ... quite new tonight .
it is new .
it is , isn' t it , sire ?
yes , indeed .
so then , you liked it ?
you really liked it , sire ?
well , of course i did !
it' s very good !
of course , now and then ... just now and then ... ... it seemed a touch ....
what do you mean ?
well , i mean , occasionally , it seems to have ...
how shall one say ....
how shall one say , direktor ?
too many notes , your majesty ?
exactly .
very well put .
too many notes .
i don' t understand .
there are just as many notes as are required , neither more nor less .
my dear fellow , there are in fact ... ... only so many notes one can hear in an evening .
i' m right in saying that , aren' t i , court composer ?
yes .
on the whole , yes , majesty .
this is absurd !
my dear young man , don' t take it too hard .
your work is ingenious .
it' s quality work .
there are simply too many notes .
just cut a few and it' il be perfect .
which few did you have in mind , majesty ?
wolfgang , my dear !
majesty , this is frau weber .
she is my landlady .
enchanted , madame .
sire ... such an honor !
this is my dear daughter , constanze .
she is the fiance of herr mozart .
how charming .
please .
when do you marry ?
we haven' t exactly received my father' s consent yet .
not entirely .
not altogether .
excuse me ... ... but how old are you ?
26 .
my advice is for you to marry this charming young lady ... ... and stay with us in vienna .
you see !
i told him that , majesty , but he won' t listen to me .
your majesty , you give such wonderful ... ... such royal advice .
may i ....
well ... ... there it is .
get some water !
will you get some water , please ?
at that moment i knew ... ... he' d had her .
the creature had had my darling girl .
it was incomprehensible !
what was god up to ?
my heart was filling up ... ... with such hatred for that little man .
for the first time in my life ... ... i began to know ... ... really violent thoughts .
i won' t have him back .
your son is an unprincipled , spoiled , conceited brat !
yes sir ... that is the truth .
but don' t blame him .
the fault is mine entirely .
i was too indulgent with him .
please ... ... your grace ?
one more chance ?
you have leave to try .
god bless , your grace !
i thank your grace .
i thank you .
i write to you with urgent news .
i' m coming to vienna .
take no further steps towards marriage until we meet .
as you honor the father who has devoted his entire life to yours ... ... do as i bid , and await my coming .
i now join you ... ... in the holy bonds of matrimony .
those whom god hath joined together ... ... let no man put asunder ....
most beloved father .
remember how you told me vienna is the city of musicians ?
to conquer here is to conquer europe ?
with my wife i can do it .
and one day soon , when i' m wealthy ... ... you' il come and live with us and we' il be so happy .
good morning .
this is my niece , princess elizabeth .
your highness .
she has asked me to advise her on a suitable musical instructor .
i think i' ve come up with an excellent idea .
your majesty !
it would be a tremendous honor !
i was thinking of mozart .
what is your view ?
it' s an interesting idea , majesty .
but my concern ... ... is to protect you ... ... from any hint of favoritism .
favoritism .
what is this ?
what is what ?
why must i submit samples of work to a committee to teach a 13 year old girl ?
his majesty wishes it .
is he angry with me ?
quite the contrary .
then why not appoint me to the post ?
you' re not the only composer in vienna .
no .
but i' m the best .
some modesty might suit you better .
who is on this committee ?
kapellmeister bonno , count orsini rosenberg ... ... and of course , court composer salieri .
naturally the italians !
of course , always the italians !
musical idiots !
and you want them to judge my music .
young man ... ... the issue is quite simple .
if you want this position ... ... you must submit your stuff along with all your colleagues .
must i ?
well , i won' t .
how can i help you ?
frau mozart ?
i' ve come on behalf of my husband .
i brought samples of his work so he can be considered for the appointment .
how charming , but ... why did he not come himself ?
he' s terribly busy , sir .
i understand .
i will look at them , of course , the moment i can .
it will be an honor .
please ... ... give him my warmest regards .
would it be too much trouble to ask you to look at them now ?
while i wait .
i' m afraid i' m not at leisure ... ... at this precise moment .
leave them .
i assure you , they will be safe .
i really cannot do that .
he doesn' t know i' m here .
then he didn' t send you ?
no , sir .
this was my own idea .
i see .
sir , we' re desperate .
we really need this job .
my husband spends far more than he can ever earn .
i don' t mean he' s lazy , because he works all day long ....
it' s just that ... ... he' s not practical .
money simply slips through his fingers .
it' s ridiculous .
let me offer you some refreshment .
do you know what these are ?
capezzoli di venere !
nipples of venus .
they' re roman chestnuts in brandied sugar .
try one .
go on , try one !
they' re quite surprising .
they' re wonderful !
thank you , your excellency .
don' t call me that !
keeps me at a distance .
i wasn' t born a court composer , you know .
i' m from a small town .
just like your husband .
are you sure you can' t ... ... leave this and come back again ?
it' s very tempting , sir .
but it' s impossible , i' m afraid .
wolfgang would be frantic if he knew those were missing .
you see , they' re all originals .
originals ?
yes , sir .
he doesn' t make copies .
these ... ... are originals ?
astounding !
it was actually beyond belief .
these were first and only ... ... drafts of music ....
but they showed no corrections of any kind .
not one .
he had simply ... ... written down music ... ... already finished in his head .
page after page of it ... ... as if he were just taking dictation .
and music ... ... finished as no music is ever finished .
displace one note ... ... and there would be diminishment .
displace one phrase and the structure would fall .
it was clear to me ... ... that sound i had heard in the archbishop' s palace ... ... had been no accident .
here again ... ... was the very voice of god .
i was staring through the cage ... ... of those meticulous ink strokes ... ... at an absolute beauty .
it' s not good ?
it' s miraculous !
he' s very proud of his work .
you will help us ?
from now on we are enemies ... ... you and i.
because you choose for your instrument , a boastful ... ... lustful , smutty , infantile boy ... ... and give me for reward only the ability ... ... to recognize the incarnation .
because you are unjust ... ... unfair ... ... unkind ... ... i will block you .
i swear it .
i will hinder and harm your creature on earth ... ... as far as i am able .
i will ruin ... ... your incarnation .
you' re thin .
doesn' t that wife of yours feed you ?
feed !
of course she feeds me .
she stuffs me like a goose , all day !
is she not here ?
no , she had to help her mother .
she' s like that .
her mother' s a very sweet woman .
i didn' t know you were home .
my father .
we' il wait .
why don' t you get up now ?
she' s very tired , poor creature .
you know me .
i' m such a pig .
it' s not easy cleaning up after me .
no maid ?
no .
we could if we wanted ... ... but stanzi wouldn' t hear of it .
she insists on doing everything .
how is your ... ... financial situation ?
couldn' t be better .
that' s not what i hear .
what do you mean ?
it' s wonderful .
really , it' s marvelous !
people love me here .
they say you have debts .
who ?
who says that ?
a malicious lie !
you have pupils ?
i don' t want pupils !
they get in the way .
i have to have time for composition .
composition doesn' t pay .
you know that .
that one will .
what' s that ?
it' s a secret .
you don' t have secrets from me .
no !
no !
please !
i don' t want you to see it .
i don' t want anyone to .
but you' il be so proud of me , papa .
it' s going to be the best thing that i' ve ever done .
there she is !
look at her !
isn' t she beautiful ?
confess it .
could you want a prettier daughter ?
stop it , wolfie !
i look dreadful .
are you expecting ?
yes , i am .
isn' t it marvelous ?
we' re delighted .
may i offer you some tea ?
who wants tea ?
let' s go out !
this calls for a feast .
you don' t want tea , do you ?
i know !
let' s go dancing .
papa loves parties , don' t you ?
how can you be so boring ?
tea !
i name the penalty !
and the penalty is ....
give her a good one !
show your legs !
come on , come on !
it' s just a game .
herr mozart !
name your son' s penalty !
yes , papa .
name it .
i' il do anything you say .
anything .
i want you to come back to salzburg with me , my son .
you can only give a penalty that can be performed in the room !
i' m tired of this game .
but my penalty !
i' ve got to have a penalty !
i name a penalty !
the penalty is ... ... you can play our little tune in the manner of johann sebastian bach !
turn him over !
now you play it backwards !
another one !
give me another one !
play like gluck !
boring !
another !
handel !
i don' t like him !
another one !
salieri .
a challenge !
that is a challenge .
please !
please !
go on !
mock me !
laugh !
that was not mozart laughing , father .
that was god .
that was god laughing at me through that obscene giggle .
go on , signore , laugh .
show my mediocrity for all to see .
one day i will laugh at you .
before i leave this earth ... ... i will laugh at you .
there' s a young girl here to see you .
what' s she want ?
she won' t talk to me .
she says she has to speak to you .
are you herr mozart ?
that' s right .
my name is lorl , sir .
i' m a maidservant .
i was asked to come here and offer my services to you .
they' il be paid for ... ... by a great admirer of yours who wishes to remain ... ... anonymous .
is this your idea , papa ?
mine ?
are you playing a trick on me ?
i' ve never seen her .
this a joke ?
not at all !
young woman , this won' t do .
my son can' t possibly accept ... ... such an offer , no matter how generous ... ... unless he knows who' s behind it .
i really can' t tell you that , sir .
this is ridiculous !
what is ridiculous ?
wolfie has many admirers in vienna .
they love him here .
people send us gifts all the time .
but you cannot possibly accept her without references .
this is none of your business .
whoever sent you is going to pay ?
that' s right , ma' am .
splendid !
so , now we' re going to let a stranger into our house .
who is we ?
who is letting who ?
could you wait outside ?
yes , ma' am .
look , old man !
we spend a fortune on you , and you just criticize , morning to night .
no !
it' s right that he should hear !
i' m sick to death of it .
we can' t do anything right for you , can we ?
you won' t have to do anything for me ever again .
i' m leaving .
i won' t stay and be a burden to anyone .
no one calls you that .
she says i sleep all day .
and so you do !
the only time you come out is to eat .
but what do you expect ?
do you expect anyone to walk out into a mess like this every day ?
so , now i' m a bad housekeeper !
so you are !
the place is like a pigsty all the time .
parties every night .
parties all night !
thank you , sir .
do any pupils come to the house ?
not that i' ve seen .
then how does he pay for all this ?
does he work at all ?
yes , sir .
all day long .
he never leaves the house until evening .
he just sits there writing and writing .
really !
what is he writing ?
i wouldn' t know that , sir .
of course not .
you' re a good girl .
you' re kind to do it .
next time they' re out of the house ... ... let me know .
thank you , sir .
i think i found out about the money .
yes ?
what ?
he kept seven snuff boxes in here .
i could swear they were all gold .
and now look .
there' s only one left .
where does he work ?
i have just heard some news that may be of interest to you .
what ?
mozart is writing a new opera .
an italian opera .
italian ?
that' s not all .
he has chosen for his subject , figaro .
the marriage of figaro .
he is setting that play to music ?
yes .
what is this marriage of figaro ?
it' s a french play , kapellmeister .
it has been banned by the emperor .
you' re absolutely sure ?
gentlemen , sit down .
are you aware that i have declared the french play of figaro ... ... unsuitable for our theatre ?
yes , sire .
yet we hear you' re making an opera from it .
is this true ?
who told you ?
it is not your place to ask questions .
is it true ?
yes .
i admit it is .
would you tell me why ?
majesty , it is only a comedy .
what you think ... ... is scarcely the point .
it' s what his majesty thinks that counts .
i am a tolerant man .
i do not censor things lightly .
when i do , i have good reason .
figaro ... ... is a bad play .
it stirs up hatred between classes .
in france it has caused nothing but bitterness .
my sister antoinette writes me that she is beginning ... ... to be frightened of her own people .
sire , i swear to you , there' s nothing like that in the piece .
i took out everything that could give offense .
i hate politics .
i' m afraid you' re rather innocent , my friend .
in these dangerous times ... ... i cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people ... ... simply over a theatre piece .
majesty , this is just a frolic .
a piece about love .
love .
again !
and it' s new !
it' s entirely new .
it' s so new that people will go mad for it .
i have scenes ....
the end of the second act , for example ....
it' s a simple duet ... ... just a husband and a wife quarreling .
suddenly ... ... the wife' s scheming little maid comes in .
it' s a very funny situation .
duet turns into trio .
the valet enters .
he' s plotting with the maid .
trio turns into quartet .
then a gardener comes in .
quartet becomes quintet , and so on and on ... ... sextet , septet , octet .
how long do you think i can sustain that ?
i have no idea .
guess .
guess , your majesty .
imagine the longest it could be sustained ... ... then double it .
well ... ... 6 ?
7 minutes .
8 minutes ?
20 , sire !
20 minutes !
20 minutes of continuous music .
no recitatives !
only opera can do this .
in a play , if more than one person speaks at once ... ... it' s just noise .
no one can understand a word .
but with opera , with music ....
with music you can have 20 individuals all talking at the same time .
and it' s not noise .
it' s a perfect harmony !
music is not the issue .
no one doubts your talent .
it' s your literary judgment that' s in question .
even with the politics taken out of it , it would still remain a vulgar farce .
why waste your spirit on such rubbish ?
surely ... ... you can choose more elevated themes .
elevated !
what does that mean , elevated ?
i am fed ... ... to the teeth with these ... ... elevated things .
old dead legends .
why must we go on forever ... ... writing only about gods and legends ?
because they do .
they go on forever .
at least what they represent : the eternal in us .
opera is here to ennoble us , mozart .
you and me , just the same as his majesty .
come on now , be honest !
who wouldn' t rather listen to a hairdresser than hercules ?
or horatius or orpheus .
so lofty , they sound as if they shit marble !
what !
govern your tongue , mozart , how dare you !
forgive me , majesty .
i' m a vulgar man .
but , i assure you , my music is not .
you are passionate , mozart ... ... but you do not persuade .
sire , the whole opera is finished .
you know how much work i did ?
his majesty has been ... ... more than patient .
how can i persuade you if i can' t show it ?
that will do .
let me tell how it begins .
may i just do that ?
show how it begins ?
please .
there' s a servant down on his knees .
and do you know why ?
not from any oppression , no .
because he' s measuring a space .
do you know what for ?
his bed .
his wedding bed .
to see if it will fit !
late !
on the beat .
good !
yes !
early !
mozart is already rehearsing .
in that case , gentlemen , i think ...
... we should help him all we can .
and do our best to protect him against the emperor' s anger .
what anger ?
about the ballet .
what ballet ?
excuse me ... ... but didn' t his majesty specifically ... ... forbid the ballet at his opera ?
a word with you .
certainly , herr direktor .
now , herr mozart !
five minutes , please .
do you not know that his majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in operas ?
it' s not a ballet , it' s a dance at figaro' s wedding .
exactly .
a dance .
surely , his majesty didn' t mean no dancing when it' s in the story .
it is dangerous to interpret his edicts .
give me your score , please .
thank you .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
taking out what you should never have put in .
please .
i have no one else to turn to .
what is it ?
it' s unbelievable .
the direktor has actually torn up a huge section of my music .
they say i have to rewrite the opera .
but it' s perfect as it is .
i can' t ... ... rewrite what' s perfect .
please .
can' t you talk to him ?
why bother with rosenberg ?
he' s no friend of yours .
i could kill him .
i mean , really !
kill him !
i threw the entire score into the fire , he made me so angry .
you burned the score ?
no , my wife took it out in time .
thank god .
it' s unfair that a man like that should have power over our work .
but others have power over him .
i think i' il take this up with the emperor .
excellency ... ... would you ?
with all my heart , mozart .
thank you .
please , herr mozart .
please , it' s not a holy relic .
i don' t need to tell you i said nothing whatever to the emperor .
i went to the theatre to tell mozart something , anything ... ... when suddenly ... ... in the middle of the third act ... ... to my astonishment , the emperor ... ... who never attended rehearsals ... ... suddenly appeared .
what is this ?
i don' t understand .
is it modern ?
the herr direktor ... ... he has removed un balletto ... ... that would have occurred at this place .
why ?
it' s your regulation .
no ballet in your opera .
do you like this ?
it' s not a question of liking .
your own law decrees it , i' m afraid .
look at them !
this is nonsense !
let me see the scene with the music .
oblige me !
can we see the scene with the music , please ?
certainly !
certainly , herr direktor .
bring the palace set back in , please .
the restored third act ... ... was bold , brilliant .
the fourth ... ... was astounding .
i saw a woman ... ... disguised in her maid' s clothes ... ... hear her husband speak the first tender words he' d offered her in years .
simply because he thinks she is someone else .
i heard the music of true forgiveness filling the theatre ... ... conferring on all who sat there perfect absolution .
god was singing through this little man ... ... to all the world .
unstoppable .
making my defeat more bitter with every passing bar .
and then ... do you know what happened ?
a miracle !
with that yawn ... ... i saw my defeat turn ... ... into a victory .
mozart was lucky the emperor yawned only once .
three yawns ... ... and the opera would fail the same night .
two yawns ... ... within a week at most .
with one yawn ... ... the composer could still get .... nine performances !
nine , that' s all it' s had ... and withdrawn .
i know , i know .
it' s outrageous .
still , if the public doesn' t like one' s work ... ... one has to accept the fact gracefully .
but what is it they don' t like ?
i can speak for the emperor .
you make too many demands on the royal ear .
he can' t concentrate over an hour .
you gave him four .
what did you think of it ?
did you like it at all ?
i thought it was marvelous .
of course .
it' s the best opera yet written !
i know it .
why didn' t they come ?
i think you overestimate our dear viennese , my friend .
you didn' t even give them a good bang at the end of songs ... ... to tell them when to clap .
i know .
you should give me lessons in that .
i wouldn' t presume .
nevertheless , at the risk of imposing ... ... i' d like you to see my new piece .
it would be a tremendous honor for me .
no , the honor would be all mine .
i believe ... ... i believe ... ... it is the best opera ... ... yet written , my friends .
you are the brightest star ... ... in the musical firmament .
you do honor to vienna ... ... and to me .
it was good of you to come .
how could i not ?
bravo , maestro .
did my work please you ?
i never knew that music like that was possible .
you flatter me .
one hears such sounds ... ... and what can one say but ... ... salieri !
everybody' s here and we' ve got guests .
i' ve got some more .
you remember my good friend schikaneder .
come in !
don' t be shy .
this is ... ... a very nice girl , and this is too ....
yes , my love ?
these gentlemen are from salzburg .
we were just talking about salzburg .
your father is dead .
so rose ... ... the dreadful ghost , from his next ... ... and blackest opera .
there , on the stage , stood the figure of a dead commander .
and i knew ... ... only i understood ... ... that the horrifying apparition was leopold ... ... raised from the dead !
wolfgang had summoned up his own father ... ... to accuse his son before all the world !
it was ... ... terrifying and wonderful to watch .
and now ...
... the madness began in me .
the madness of a man splitting in half .
through my influence , i saw to it ... ... don giovanni was played only five times in vienna .
but , in secret , i went to every one of those five .
worshipping sound ... ... i alone seemed to hear .
as i stood there , understanding ... ... how that bitter old man still possessed his poor son ... ... even from beyond the grave ... ... i began to see a way ... ... a terrible way ... ... i could finally triumph ... ... over god .
i have come to commission work from you .
what work ?
a mass for the dead .
what dead ?
who' s dead ?
a man who deserved a requiem mass ... ... and never got one .
who are you ?
i am only a messenger .
do you accept ?
you' il be well paid .
do you accept ?
work fast .
and be sure to tell no one what you do .
you will see me again soon .
my plan was so simple ... ... that it terrified me .
first , i must get the death mass , and then ... ... i must achieve his death .
what ?
his funeral !
imagine it !
the cathedral ... ... all vienna sitting there .
his coffin ... ... mozart' s little coffin in the middle .
and then ... ... in that silence ... ... music !
a divine music bursts out over them all .
a great mass of death .
requiem mass for wolfgang mozart .
composed by his devoted friend ... ... antonio salieri .
what sublimity !
what depth !
what passion in the music !
salieri has been touched by god at last ... ... and god forced to listen .
powerless to stop it !
i , for once , in the end , laughing at him !
the only thing that worried me ... ... was the actual killing .
how does one do that ?
how does one kill a man ?
it' s one thing ... ... to dream about it .
very different when you ...
... when you have to do it ... ... with your own hands .
come in !
i' ve come to dinner .
dinner !
are you mad ?
i' m a nobleman .
i only ever dine with people of my own height .
stop it !
be careful !
be careful !
hold tight !
i' m a famous ... ... horseman
and we' re a famous horsie
give me a hoof , my darling
and i' il give you my heart
take me to your stable
and never more we' il part
kill me !
kill me !
we' re going to make a soprano stew
and when you make a soprano stew
shut up !
i' m sick to death of that tune !
give him some hay , my darling
and i' il give you my heart
leporello !
some hay !
we hope you' re contented
with what we' ve presented
and love our dove of peace
what did you think ?
wonderful !
he liked the little people .
it' s all in good fun .
i liked the horse .
i tell you , if you played don giovanni here ... ... you would have had a wonderful success .
you belong here !
not at the snobby court .
you could do anything you like .
the more fantastic , the better .
that' s what people want : fantasy !
you write a proper part for me and a couple of catchy songs ... ... i guarantee you a triumph deluxe !
what do you say ?
how much will you pay him ?
i see you brought your manager with you .
well , madame ... ... how about ... ... half the receipts ?
half the receipts !
i' m talking about now .
how much will you pay him now ?
down payment .
down payment ?
who do you think i am , the emperor ?
i have to go .
stay , you' il enjoy this .
you won' t do this .
why not ?
half the house !
when ?
we need money now !
either he pays you now , or you don' t do it .
i don' t trust that man .
and i don' t like what he did with your opera .
it was common .
you liked it .
monkey , punky , flunky !
half the house !
you' il never see a penny .
i want it here in my hand .
i' il put it here in your hand .
you won' t put a thing in my hand until i see some money !
don' t answer it .
why ?
tell him i' m not here .
tell him i' m working on it .
come back later .
am i interrupting something ?
no .
good .
where' s our friend ?
he' s not here .
but he said he' s working on it .
is that it ?
is he happy with it ?
what' s this ?
requiem mass ?
you think i' m in the funeral business ?
put it down !
put it down !
put it down , it' s nothing for you !
i' m sorry .
what have you got for me ?
finished ?
what ?
the vaudeville , what do you think ?
yes .
can i see it ?
no .
why not ?
because there' s nothing to see .
i asked you if we could start rehearsals next week and you said yes .
we can .
so let me see it .
where is it ?
here .
it' s all right here in my noodle .
the rest is just scribbling .
scribbling and bibbling , bibbling and scribbling .
want a drink ?
do you know how many people i' ve hired for you ?
leave him alone !
i' m paying these people !
he' s doing his best .
i' m paying them to wait for you .
it' s ridiculous !
you know what' s ridiculous ?
your libretto' s ridiculous !
only an idiot would ask wolfie to work on that !
12 foot snakes , magic flutes ?
what' s so intelligent about a requiem ?
money .
you' re mad .
she' s mad .
wolfie , write it down .
just write it down .
on paper .
it' s no use to anybody in your head .
to hell with your death mass !
calm yourself .
what' s the matter with you ?
i' m not working there anymore .
what has happened ?
you don' t know what it' s like .
herr mozart frightens me .
he drinks all day ... ... then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse .
is he working ?
i' m frightened , sir , really !
when he speaks he makes no sense .
is he working ?
i suppose so .
he sits there all the time , doing some silly opera .
please , don' t ask me to go back again .
i' m frightened .
i' m very , very frightened !
are you sure it' s an opera ?
i don' t have it yet .
are you neglecting my request ?
i promise you .
i' il give you the best piece i ever
this is my wife .
i' ve been sick but i' m all right now , aren' t i ?
yes , sir .
he' s all right .
and he' s working on it very hard .
two more weeks .
please .
the sooner you finish , the greater your reward .
work !
i think you really are going mad .
you work like a slave for that idiot actor who won' t give you a penny !
and here ....
this is not a ghost !
this is a real man who puts down real money .
why on earth won' t you finish it ?
can you give me one reason i can understand ?
it' s killing me .
you' re drunk , aren' t you ?
be honest , tell me .
you' ve been drinking .
it' s not fair .
i worry about you all the time .
i do everything i can to help you .
and all you do is drink and talk nonsense , and frighten me .
go to bed !
please .
let me sit here .
let me stay here with you .
i did it !
and i was proud to do it .
leave , i said !
right away !
and take the child with you !
here' s the money !
go to the spa ... ... and get your health back .
i was shocked ... ... shocked to my foundation when i saw her .
i couldn' t believe my eyes , poor little thing .
you monster !
no one exists but you , do they ?
you and your music .
i warned her .
choose a man , not a baby , " i said .
you marry him , you won' t have a pot to piss in .
you selfish thing !
selfish , that' s what you are .
selfish .
simply selfish !
do you hear me ?

is it over ?
yes , it' s over .
it' s over .

she went to the spa .
you are so good to me .
truly .
thank you .
please !
no , i mean , to come to my opera .
you are the only colleague of mine who came .
i would never miss anything you had written .
it' s just a vaudeville .
it' s a sublime piece .
the grandest operone !
i tell you ... ... you are the greatest composer known to me .
do you mean it ?
it' s him !
who ?
the man .
he' s here .
tell him to go away .
tell him i' m still working on it .
don' t let him in .
wait !
ask him if he would give me some money now .
tell him it will help me finish .
can we come in ?

he' s sleeping .
he' s all right ?
yes , he' s just exhausted .
he became dizzy .
that' s all .

and now good night to you all .

it' s making him ill .
good night .
i regret we have no servants to show you out , herr salieri .
respect my wish and go .
i will respect his .
your merciful god .
he destroyed his own beloved ... ... rather than let a mediocrity ... ... share in the smallest part of his glory .
he killed mozart .
and kept me alive to torture .
32 years of torture .
32 years ... ... of slowly watching myself become extinct !
my music ... ... growing fainter .
all the time fainter ... ... till no one plays it at all .
and his ....
good morning !
time for the water closet .
then we have your favorite breakfast .
sugar rolls !
he loves those .
fresh sugar rolls .
i will speak for you , father .
i speak for all mediocrities in the world .
i am their champion .
i am their patron saint .
mediocrities everywhere ... ... i absolve you .
i absolve you .
i absolve you all .
