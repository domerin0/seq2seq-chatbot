karl ruprecht kroenen .
born in munich , 1897 .
suffered from a masochistic compulsion ...
... commonly known as surgical addiction .
both eyelids surgically removed ... ... along with his upper ... ... and lower lip .
the blood in his veins dried up decades ago .
only dust remains .
what horrible will ...
... could keep such a creature as this alive ?
and one of those cookies .
do you have any doughnuts ?
sorry , pal .
how about a bear claw ?
no .
he' s determined , unstoppable .
some people would call that cocky .
he' s just strong .
yeah .
that he is .
hey , i' ve got yours .
my uncle , he used to say we like people for their qualities ... ... but love them for their defects .
he loves you , you know .
what about you ?
i don' t know .
i grew up with him .
but now every time i see him , i get confused .
there' s hardly a day that goes by that he' s not in my mind .
even now ... ... i feel like he' s here .
hey , wait up .
you like doughnuts ?
i got two .
thanks .
that was nice .
i got a cookie , as well .
sugar ?

she took his picture .
she took his picture .

newark , new jersey , entertainment capital of the world .
you sound like a game show host .
hi .

sebastian plackba , number 16 .
moscow .
who wants us in moscow ?
my mom baked them .
she' s laughing .
she' s sitting on a park bench , and she' s laughing .
that' s it .
i' m done .
they don' t look like spies .
are you kidding me ?
look at this guy .
those shady little eyes , that phony grin .
are you going to eat that ?
no .
hey , he' s yawning .
he' s bored .
yeah , the old yawning trick .
watch his arm .
first he wants my job , then he wants my girl .

sebastian plackba , number 16 .
it' s rasputin' s mausoleum .
it' s rasputin' s mausoleum .
i see the puppet .
but where is ... ... the puppeteer ?
very good , professor broom .
it was you .
the scraps of paper ... ... liz' s sudden relapse and return .
bread crumbs on the trail .
like in a fable .
they both distract him ... ... and guide him exactly where i need him .
moscow .
his destiny .
and the last clue ... ... will be left by the late professor broom .
you raised the child .
nurtured him .
so in return ... ... i will permit you ...
... a brief , brief glimpse of the future .
he will open the portal ... ... and bring about the end of the world .
if only you had had him destroyed 60 years ago ... ... none of this would have come to pass .
but then , how could you have known ?
your god chooses to remain silent .
mine lives within me .
every time i died and crossed over ... ... a little more of the master ... ... came back with me .
he disclosed to me the child' s true name .
would you like to know it ?
i know what to call him .
i call him ...
... son .
i' m ready .
it' il be quick .
just go there and tell her how you feel .
my mom says that ...
look , it' s not ...
it' s not that easy , okay ?
plus , you' re 9 .
you' re not old enough to be giving me advice .
all right , stand by .
who are those guys ?
liz , i' m sorry .
it' s broom .
let' s go .
we need to find him .
no !
wait , what happened ?
no !
it' s okay .
no , not him .
would you take her ?
something' s wrong .
he hasn' t spoken to anybody in three days .
not a word .
he won' t eat , he won' t sleep .
i' ve never seen him like this .
never .
should i stay ?
with him , i mean ?
listen , i' m not much of a problem solver .
three decades , i' ve only completed two sides .
but i do know this much .
if there' s trouble ... ... all us freaks have is each other .
and i' m stuck here .
so ...
... take care of the big monkey for me , will you ?
volokolamsk fields , 50 miles from moscow , that' s where we' re going .
sebastian plackba , number 16 .
that' s the only clue we have .
we' ve collected and destroyed thousands of eggs ... ... but we have no trace of this sammael or this rasputin character .
we leave as soon as we get clearance and equipment .
hellboy' s coming .
i' m not pleased about that , but i' il be in charge this time .
we either wrap this up or i' m closing this freak show for good .
hi .
hi .
i' il ... ... come to moscow ... ... if you' re still going .
i am .
but i have something to say .
i understand what you don' t like about me .
i do .
what i am ... ... makes you feel a little out of place ... ... out there .
red , i don' t ...
listen .
i' m not like myers .
he makes you feel like you belong ...
... which is good , really .
i wish i could do something about this .
i can' t .
one , i' il always look this good .
and two ... ... i' il never give up on you .
ever .
i like that .
one falls , two shall arise .
sammael .
we' il have to nail them all at once , and the eggs .
and when we do , no mumbo jumbo .
double core vulcan 65 grenades .
we' ve installed a handy little timer .
you set it , you walk away .
cable pulls the safety pins .
kaboom .
easy to clean , easy to use .
sparky to big red .
do you read me ?
come in .
sparky " ?
who came up with that ?
myers ?
yeah , we' re leaving the main road , so hang on .
this better be the place or i' il puke .
you better come out and see .
sebastian plackba , number 16 .
forget it .
we' re never gonna find rasputin' s mausoleum .
now , what we do here is we make up a grid .
we go in by quadrants .
maybe satellite photography .
let me ask for directions .
what' d he say ?
come on , baby , find me a talker .
hi there .

ivan says there' s a whole network of tunnels down here .
goes on for miles .

anybody sees anything ...
i' il say " marco .
polo .

she' s a tough one .
come on .
ask your buddy how far this thing goes .
how you doing up there , ivan ?

he is so negative .

hey , what' s wrong with you ? !
you killed my father .
your ass is mine .
what are you laughing at , you nazi son of a ... ?
don' t even think about it .
that' s all for you , pinhead .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
having a ...
you never light a cigar that way .
you use a wooden match .
preserves the flavor .
you see ?
thank you .
thank you .
so he thinks you and i ...
that' s why he' s mad at me .
but it' s not true , right ?
what ?
well , that , you know , you feel that way about me .
you want to know that here ?
now ?
yeah .
red , white , whatever .
guys are all the same .
hey , wait up .

i got them right below me .
it' s a matter of minutes .
okay , good .
could you hurry up ?
because it' s a little spooky in here .
liz , wait .

let' s back out real slow .
myers , ready your grenades .

what do you want me to do ?
hit me .
what ?
hit me .
now !
you should be running .
they are all here .
all of them .
just the way it was promised .
this one' s awake .
thank you for this .
and i looked ... ... and beheld an angel .
and in his right hand , the key to the bottomless pit .
these were the words i heard as a peasant boy in tobolsk .
and now , the door .
sent by the ogdru jahad ...
... so that they might at long last enter our world .
you are the key , the right hand of doom .
your stone hand .
what did you think it was made for ?
open the locks .
don' t do it , red !
don' t do it !
silence .
imagine it .
an eden ... ... for you and her .
no .
no ?
in exchange for her soul , then ?
open the door .
no .
as you wish .
no !
liz !
her soul awaits on the other side .
if you want her back ...
... open the door and claim her .
your true name is inscribed around the locks that hold you .
you cannot break them ... ... no matter how strong you are .
the eclipse has begun .
your true name ...
... say it !
become the key .
for her .
anung un rama .
repeat it .
anung un rama .
open the final lock .
remember who you are !
believe me , i have lived long enough to know ... ... not a tear will be shed for this world !
you have a choice .
your father gave you that .
no , you don' t !
open it !
do it !
what have you done ?
i chose .
you will never fulfill your destiny .
you will never understand the power inside you .
i' il just have to find a way to live with that .
child .
look what you' ve done .
you' ve killed me ... ... an insignificant man .
but you have brought forth ...
... a god .
myers , let' s go .
hell will hold no surprises for us .
i took a grenade belt .
the damn thing' s broken .
keep her safe , will you ?
whatever happens , don' t leave her alone .
i won' t .
you' re okay , myers .
stick around .
hey , red .
just pull the cable .
i didn' t get you anything .
are you going to be okay alone ?
how big can it be ?
damn !
damn .
oh , this is gonna hurt .
gonna be sore in the morning .
she' s got no pulse .
she' s not breathing .
liz ?
i was so foolish .
red .
in the dark ...
... i heard your voice .
what did you say ?
i said , " hey ... ... you on the other side ... ... let her go .
because for ...
for her i' il cross over .
and then you' il be sorry .
what makes a man a man ?
a friend of mine once wondered .
is it his origins ?
the way he comes to life ?
i don' t think so .
it' s the choices he makes .
not how he starts things ...
... but how he decides to end them .
hey , guys ?
i' m still here .
hello ?
