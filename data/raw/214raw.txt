madeleine , can we buy some milk from you ?
one quart .
take it off the top so there' s lots of cream .
thanks .
the same , but with more cream .
thanks .
it' s a shame .
such a nice girl .
imagine not being able to talk .
completely mute .
no wonder , after what happened .
such a sweet , young girl .
it must be 15 years ago by now .
and the old man who raped her got off scot free .
they said he was insane .
not responsible for his actions .
but it sure is strange the girl can' t talk .
the doctor said it was because of the trauma .
some kind of mental block .
madeleine .
you better hurry if you want to catch the 4 : 00 bus .
you haven' t had any time off for a month .
can you give me a single reason not to come to town with me ?
hi , my name is tony .
got this car today .
isn' t she a beauty ?
a 3000 gto .
157 horses .
goes from zero to 100 in 8 1/ 2 seconds .
max speed just over 200 .
you buy the hottest car in town , but still the best is missing .
a chick to drive around with .
would you like something to eat ?
it' s on the company .
we' il start with cheese and herring ... followed by the pepper steak flamb .
figs in cognac flamb .
red wine , and akvavit with the herring ... and some champagne to start .
i like women who don' t talk too much ... but you set a new record .
welcome .
may i take your coat ?
thanks .
won' t you sit down ?
i' il get something to drink .
cheers .
you aren' t drinking .
it won' t kill you .
just good stuff .
cheers .
hello , nurse ?
it' s tony .
is the doctor in ?
thanks , that' s kind of you .
hi , it' s tony .
a new prospect .
110 pounds .
a real beginner .
how much will we need ?
can you bring the shots immediately ?
she' s sound asleep now .
sure , great .
see you .
hi , it' s tony .
in ten days i' il have a fine new chick ready .
how about that ?
the fifth this year .
soon we can close up and retire to switzerland .
that' s great .
so long .
good to see you , sam .
here' s our patient .
she needs a little stimulation .
just sign your name .
sign the duplicate too .
no need to read it .
just sign it .
where the hell are you going ?
there you are ... my love .
now , here' s the situation .
you have become hooked on heroin ... which isn' t like your ordinary amphetamines .
it' s the toughest narcotic in existence .
you' re hooked both physically and psychologically ... and you' il die in 48 hours if you don' t get a fix .
but we' re not going to have any trouble , are we ?
do as i say and you' il get your two shots a day .
" i never want ... to see you again .
because you never understood .
you never understood how much i hated that terrible farm .
how your protective instincts suffocated me .
i have found a wonderful man who has given my life meaning .
i' m doing everything to forget my horrible time with you .
i hope you' il forget about me quickly .
you' il never see me again ... because i never want to see you again .
signed , madeleine .
well , my little friend , now life really begins .
you' il get two of these a day if you do as i say .
your first visitor arrives at 1 : 00 .
no mistakes , or you' il go without .
now , let' s have a look at your room .
the accountant is arriving soon .
be nice to him .
hi , sweetheart .
take off your clothes .
tony !
what the hell ?
goddamn it !
what kind of bitches do you have here ?
how can i go home to my wife with my face looking like this ?
damn it !
i' m gonna scar her for life .
i' m doing great .
how about you ?
what ?
the pirate ?
let me check .
tuesday ?
the pirate is available between 2 : 00 and 4 : 00 .
but the price has gone up .
yeah , she' s more than sally .
is that okay ?
great .
my pleasure .
thank you .
this is how it is from now on .
you' re on your own .
every morning at 9 : 00 , you' il get a list from me with names of customers and times they' il arrive .
you' il get two packets so you can make it through the day .
monday' s your day off .
on sunday you' il get four packets so you can make it through tuesday .
if you behave , you' il get a percentage of the profits .
that' s fair , isn' t it ?
here' s today' s list .
in half an hour you start with mr. andersson .
what ?
that' s right .
i almost forgot .
get undressed .
my name' s sally .
you poor thing .
the beginning' s the worst .
you feel so sick you wanna die .
the only thing that keeps you going is the dependency on dope .
if you go without for too long , then you really start feeling things .
goddamn !
i tried to leave here once .
i ran back to my little town .
to mom .
but i fell apart .
i thought i' d die .
tony sent two thugs to get me .
horrible bastards .
they' il do anything for a couple of grand .
after those guys , being back here seemed all right .
at the most you' il last 30 36 hours without getting a new hit .
after that , it' s over .
you get paranoid .
then you die , unless you get another hit .
but i' ve got a plan of my own to fall back on .
i hit up all the johns for additional loot .
for a bit of extra service .
in a year i' il have enough to take off for switzerland .
there' s a rehab clinic there for drug addicts .
it takes four months before you' re cured .
but it takes dough .
around 60, 000 for the entire treatment .
i should be able to leave in about a year .
i get this way sometimes .
i can' t help it .
hey , i saw tony had a letter for you .
i took it when he wasn' t looking .
what a terrible letter we received today .
how can our little madeleine ... be so full of hate ?
what did we do wrong ?
what we did wrong you could have set right .
now we have nothing to live for .
we are tormented by the fact that our little madeleine ... is so full of hate .
after all these terrible disappointments ... your father and i only want to tell you ... not to worry .
you will never see us again .
madeleine ... you were our everything .
the sunshine of our lives .
good bye .
the doctor said it was poison ... but i wonder where it came from .
it seems awfully strange they were the only ones poisoned .
a lot of people bought milk that day .
well , i wonder .
you don' t pour poison in your milk by mistake .
i still wonder if it wasn' t ...
sure , after those terrible letters the girl wrote her parents .
terrible letters .
i read the last one .
they took it really hard .
so , you want to learn how to drive faster than the average guy .
half of this will do .
this is a model 96 rifle , also called a mauser .
it was used in both world wars .
if you lie down ... a little further back .
there .
hold it against your shoulder , because it has a good kick .
hold it steady .
to load , lower the weapon .
pull the bolt up , then back , and then insert the cartridge .
push down and move the bolt forward .
then bring the gun up against your shoulder .
make sure you keep it steady against your shoulder .
place your finger on the trigger and gently squeeze off a shot .
reload .
check your shoulder .
now aim and squeeze .
you' il have a visitor today who' s never been here before .
take good care of
this is tony .
oh , hi there .
good , as usual .
sorry , what did you say ?
the 2 4th ?
let' s have a look .
she' s just great , as usual .
step back .
you' re striking too quickly .
sink down and strike hard .
that' s better .
step back .
now look .
if you' re coming into a curve like this ... and you start to skid ... you have to steer into the skid .
steer into it like this until you come out of it here .
then you floor it .
wait here .
i have a present for you .
an extra hit .
by the way , sally' s gone .
she won' t be back .
got another job in beirut .
that' s her business .
hope it works out well for her .
i can' t teach you anymore .
i' il be damned !
all bull' s eyes .
hell , you want that much ?
you want a powerful one ?
i need two more bills .
you got a car too .
three beers .
we' ve got trouble .
madeleine shot a customer .
she may be after you too .
i got you two tickets to spain .
get lost until things cool off .
yeah , it' s me .
come over right away .
i have a rush job for you .
what ?
right , 10, 000 a head .
hurry up , damn it !
great .
bye .
hello ?
what ?
axelsson ?
you' re scared ?
think how i feel !
hell , no !
she' s gone nuts .
completely mad .
no , of course i' ve closed the shop .
she has to return soon to get a fix .
take my advice and go out to the country until this is over .
what ?
no problem .
someone' s just come in .
bye .
i' m glad you got here so fast .
madeleine shot two of her customers .
set a trap for her and then take her for a drive .
she is not to be found again .
i' m out .
there' s nothing left .
i' m completely cleaned out .
i know somebody .
the hot dog man in the harbor .
go there .
car 411 .
this is 411 , over .
we have shots fired in the harbor .
warehouse three .
over .
41 1 , i read you .
over and out .
drop your weapon .
she' s totally nuts .
she' s challenged me to a duel .
i get to choose the weapons .
she should be in a nuthouse .
now she' s gonna get what' s coming to her .
i' il get her once and for all .
madeleine , what the hell are you doing ?
put down the gun , and let' s talk about this .
it' s just a misunderstanding .
what kind of nonsense is this ?
put down the rifle .
madeleine , please .
you fucking whore !
thought you could fool me , huh ?
damn slut !
which knee should i blow away first ?
fucking whore !
