welcome to gattaca .
you keep your workstation so clean , jerome .
it' s next to godliness , isn' t that what they say ?
godliness . . .
i reviewed your flight plan .
not one error in a million keystrokes .
phenomenal .
it' s right that someone like you is taking us to titan .
has the committee approved the mission ?
there' s been talk of delay .
you shouldn' t listen to talk .
you leave in a week .
you' ve got a substance test .
jerome .
never shy .
pisses on command .
a beautiful piece of equipment there , jerome .
have i ever told you that ?
only every time i' m in here .
occupational hazard .
i see a great many on the course of any given day .
yours just happens to be an exceptional example .
i wonder why my folks didn' t order one like that for me ?
by the way , have i ever told you about my son ?
no , you haven' t .
remind me to , sometime .
so you' re about to go up .
one week left .
please tell me you' re the least bit excited .
i' il tell you at the end of the week .
congratulations , jerome .
thank you .
how many launches are there in a day ?
a dozen ?
sometimes more .
you' re the only one that watches every one of them .
if you' re going to pretend like you don' t care , don' t look up .
the most unremarkable of events .
jerome morrow , navigator 1st class , is about to embark
on a one year manned mission to titan , the 14th moon of saturn .
a highly prestigious assignment , although for jerome selection was virtually guaranteed at birth .
he' s blessed with all the gifts required for such an undertaking .
a genetic quotient second to none .
no , there' s truly nothing remarkable about the progress of jerome morrow .
except that i am not jerome morrow .
i was conceived in the riviera .
not the french riviera .
the detroit variety .
they used to say that a child conceived in love has a greater chance of happiness .
they don' t say that any more .
i' il never understand what posessed my mother to put her faith in god' s hands
rather than those of her local geneticist .
ten fingers , ten toes , that' s all that used to matter ...
not now .
now , only seconds old , the exact time and cause of my death was already known .
neurological condition , 60 % probability , manic depression , 42 % probability .
attention deficit disorder , 89 % probability .
heart disorder . . .
. . .
99 % probability .
early fatal potential .
30 . 2 years .
30 years ?
the name for the certificate ?
anton .
no , vincent anton .
that' s a good name .
i know he' il do something .
you' il do something .
from an early age i came to think of myself as others thought of me .
chronically ill .
every skinned knee and runny nose was treated as if it were life threatening .
i' m sorry , the insurance won' t cover it .
if he fell . . .
but i was told ...
i really wish there were smth i could do .
like most other parents of their day , they were determined that their next child
will be brought into the world in what has become the natural way .
your extracted eggs , marie ,
have been fertilized with antonio' s sperm .
after screening , we' re left , as you see , with 2 healthy boys and 2 very healthy girls .
naturally no critical predispositions to any major inheritable diseases .
all that remains is to select the most compatible candidate .
first , you may want us to decide on a gender .
have you given it any thought ?
we would want vincent to have a brother , you know , to play with .
of course you would .
hello vincent !
you have specified hazel eyes , dark hair and . . . fair skin .
premature baldness , miopia , alcoholism , addictiveness to susceptibility ,
propensity for violence , obesity ...
we didn' t want . . .
i mean , diseases , yes , but . . .
we were just wandering if it' s good to just leave a few things to chance .
we want to give your child the best possible start .
believe me , we have enough imperfection built in already .
your child doesn' t need any additional burdens .
and keep in mind , this child is still you .
simply the best of you .
you could conceive naturally a 1 , 000 times and never get such a result .
that' s how my brother anton came into the world .
a son my father considered worthy of his name .
i' m proud of you , son .
what' d i tell you .
see how much he' s grown ?
by the time we were playing at blood brothers
i understood that there was smth very different flowing through my veins .
and i' d need an awful lot more than a drop if i was going to get anywhere .
our favourite game was chicken .
when our parents weren' t watching
we used to swim as far out as we dared .
it was about who' d get scared and turn back first .
come on , you coward !
of course it was always me .
anton was by far the stronger swimmer and he had no excuse to fail .
300 million , 350 million , 400 million .
maybe it was the love of the planets , maybe it was just my growing dislike for this one ,
but for as long as i can remember i' ve dreamed of going into space .
750 million , 800 million , 850 million .
how many astronauts are there anyway ?
i bet i could be one if i wanted .
hey don' t eat that .
it' s pluto .
my goals didn' t change a lot in the intervening years .
much to my parents ' dismay .
vincent . . .
you have to be realistic .
with a heart condition like yours . . .
mom , there' s a chance there' s nothing even wrong about it .
one chance in a 100 .
well , i' il take it , allright ?
the trouble is they won' t .
listen , for god' s sake , you' ve got to understand something .
the only way that you' il see the inside of a spaceship is if you were cleaning it .
my father was right .
it didn' t matter how much i lied on my resum .
my real resum was in my cells .
why should anybody invest all that money to train me
when there are a 1, 000 other applicants with a far cleaner profile ?
of course , it' s illegal to discriminate .
genoism " , it' s called .
but no one takes the law seriously .
if you refuse to disclose , they can always take a sample from a door handle
or a handshake .
even the saliva on your application form .
if in doubt , a legal drug test can just as easily become
an illegal peek at your future in the company .
you' re sure you wanna do this ?
you know you' re gonna lose .
it was the last time we swam together .
out into the open sea .
like always , knowing each stroke to the horizon was one we' d have to make back to the shore .
but something was very different about that day .
everytime anton tried to pull away
he found me right beside him .
until finally ... the impossible happened .
vincent !
it was the one moment in our lives that my brother was not as strong as he believed
and i was not as weak .
it was the moment that made everything else possible .
like many others in my situation
i moved around a lot next few years , getting work where i could .
i must' ve cleaned half the toilets in the state .
i belonged to a new underclass ,
no longer determined by social status or the colour of your skin .
welcome to gattaca , gentlemen .
now , we now have discrimination downto a science .
allright , there' s your cleaning material .
start from the front and clean all the way back .
and i want to see my smiling face on that floor .
what about you , your majesty ?
dreaming of space ?
come here .
start by cleaning this space right here .
i was never more certain of how far away i was from my goal
then when i was standing right beside it .
when you clean the glass , vincent , don' t clean it too well .
what do you mean ?
you might get ideas .
yeah , but if the glass is clean ,
it' il be easier for you to see me when i' m on the other side of it .
poor my brave talk .
i knew it was just that .
no matter how much i trained or how much i studied ,
the best test score in the world wasn' t gonna matter unless i had a blood test to go with it .
i' ve made up my mind to resort to more extreme measures .
the man who showed up at my doorstep didn' t exactly advertise in the yellow pages .
stand straight .
how did you hear about me ?
people .
any distinguishing marks ?
tattoos , scars , birth marks ?
no .
i don' t think so .
are you serious about this ?
i hope you' re not wasting my time .
i' d give 100 % .
that' il get you halfway there .
that' s an old edition , but i know it all by heart .
you realise the commitment is binding .
you have somebody in mind ?
for the genetically superior , success is easier to attain , but is by no means not guaranteed .
after all , there is no gene for fate .
and when for one reason or another , a member of the elite falls on hard times
their genetic identity becomes a valued commodity for the unscrupulous .
one man' s loss is another' s gain .
his credentials are impeccable .
an expiration date you wouldn' t believe .
the guy' s practically gonna live forever .
he' s got an iq off the register .
better than 20/ 20 in both eyes .
and the heart of an ox .
he could run through a wall .
if he could still run .
actually , he was a big time swimming star .
vincent , you could go anywhere with this guy' s dna tucked under your arm .
what did i tell you , you look so right together i wanna double my fee .
we don' t look anything alike .
it' s close enough .
when was the last time anybody looked at your photograph ?
you could have my face on your name tag , for christ ' sake .
but how do i explain the accident ?
that' s the beautiful thing , it happened out of the country .
there' s no record he ever broke his back .
as far as anybody' s concerned , he' s still a walkin ' talkin ' fully productive member of society .
you just have to get him clean , fill in the last year of his life .
you' re a foreigner .
they don' t care where you were born .
just how .
blood has no nationality .
as long as it' s got what they' re looking for , it' s the only passport you' il need .
who lives up there ?
well , i certainly don' t .
so began the process of becoming jerome .
myopia is one of the most obvious signs of a disadvantaged birth .
isn' t there any other way ?
surgery is no good , they' il see the scars .
it' s contact lenses or a white cane .
besides , the colour doesn' t match .
he' s right .
my eyes are prettier .
you understand i take 25 % of everything you make .
if it for some reason it doesn' t work out , all this equipment must be returned within 7 days .
and you don' t get your deposit back .
wait , wait !
i thought you said 20 % .
it' s only 5 % .
20 % .
it' s not negotiable .
i guess that' s it .
not quite .
why , why ?
there' s still the matter of the height .
why , how tall are you ?
4 foot 6 .
how tall were you before the accident ?
unfortunately , his profile says he' s 6 ' 1 " .
so , i can wear lifts .
even with lifts you' re not that tall .
so what ?
no . . .
no .
no, we never discussed that .
oh , i thought you were serious , vincent .
i am serious .
i' m not doing that .
i won' t do that .
jerome never questioned my committment again .
i took my mind off the pain by reminding myself that when i eventually did stand up
i' d be exactly two inches closer to the stars .
are you all right ?
yeah .
do you want to go dancing ?
you had to be a right hander .
no one orders southpaws any more .
jerome morrow .
it' s a nice name .
it' s my name .
i can' t be you without it .
what makes you think you can be me at all ?
look at this .
look at it .
it' s nice .
i' m impressed , is it real ?
are you colour blind , too , vincent ?
it' s silver .
jerome morrow was never meant to be one step down on the podium .
with all i had going for me , i was still second best .
me !
so how do you expect to pull this off ?
i don' t know , exactly .
your signature needs work .
soon came time to put our preparations to the test .
jerome had been engineered with everything he needed to get into gattaca , except the desire to do so .
do you really want to be in there ?
i don' t wanna be in there , i wanna be up there .
what' s up there ?
that' s want i want to find out , jerome .
call me eugene .
my middle name .
if you' re going to be jerome , you' d better start getting used to it .
i gotta get going .
where' s my sample ?
in the refrigerator .
door on the left .
which pouch ?
oh , any of them .
you think i should test it ?
if you like .
my god , what' s wrong with the machine ?
it' s nothing wrong with the machine .
it' s a hot sample .
you' ve been drinking again !
i haven' t .
oh christ eugene , it' s 8 o' clock in the morning !
i haven' t !
this is no joke .
my interview is in an hour !
there' s more vodka in this piss than there is piss !
i' m sorry .
i had half a glass to celebrate .
try friday' s , that one will be ok .
there' s only wednesday left .
wednesday .
that' s the one .
listen , it' s not too late to back out .
this is the last day that you' re gonna be you and i' m gonna be me .
well ?
congratulations .
what about the interview ?
that was it .
i got it .
of course you got it .
and that' s the way it was .
each day i' d dispose of as much loose skin , fingernails and hair as possible .
to limit how much of my in valid self i' d leave in the valid world .
at the same time , eugene prepared samples of his own superior body matter so that i might pass for him .
customized urine patches for the frequent substance tests .
fingertips blood sachees for security checks and vials filled with other traces .
while eugene supplied me with a new identity , i paid the rent
and kept him in the style to which he' d become accustomed .
eugene never suffered from a routine discrimination of a " utero " , " faith birth " , " in valid " as we would call it .
a " valid " , a " vitro " , a " made man " , he suffered under a different burden .
the burden of perfection .
i was now a member of a relatively new and particulary detested segment of society .
one of those that refuses to play the hand that he' s dealt .
almost commonly known as a " borrowed ladder " .
or ... a " de gene erate " .
in the guise of jerome morrow i' ve risen quickly for the ranks of gattaca .
only one of the mission directors has ever come close to discovering my true identity .
strange to think , he may have more success exposing me in death than he ever did in life .
i think we can rule out suicide .
excuse me , sir ?
nothing .
thank you .
this will take a while .
we may have to push things back .
irene , i want you to assist the investigators .
my work , director , that would put me behind .
i appreciate your sacrifice , irene .
will you seek to that i don' t lose my place in line ?
your place is assured .
so kindly inform the authorities that we will cooperate in any way ,
although we can' t tolerate a major disruption .
director ?
thank you , irene .
thank you , director .
director , how will this affect the mission ?
oh , we' re still going ahead as planned .
the launch window is only opened until week' s end .
tragic though this event may be , it hasn' t stopped the planets turning .
what happened ?
i' m going up .
when ?
end of the week .
end of the week , that soon ?
what about the mission director ?
he' s dead .
are you serious ?
they found him in his office this morning , beaten so badly they had to check his name tag .
you are serious .
so that' s it , there' s nothing between us and ignition .
i' m going up .
the man was murdered ?
so ?
i didn' t do it .
i didn' t say you did but if the man was murdered , the place is gonna be crawling with hoovers .
i' il take my chances with the j. edgars over the mission director .
besides , what if they do find something ?
i' m gonna be slightly out of their jurisdiction .
we have to get drunk immediately .
good evening , gentlemen .
i hear you' re leaving us , mr. morrow .
looks that way .
we' re going to miss you .
you' ve opened the wine , i hope ?
of course , sir .
pour yourself a glass , cavendish .
how old ?
me ?
the specimen ?
i kissed him five minutes ago .
a real good one .
i' il see what i can do .
you want the full sequence ?
yes .
thank you .
good luck .
9 . 3 .
quite a catch .
yes .
quite a catch .
god , how many times i' ve told cavendish . . .
this' s gotta be open more than five minutes ago !
a wine like this needs to breathe .
remember that .
you know , they say when you' re weightless is the closest thing to being in the womb .
i can' t believe you pulled this off .
they' re sending you up there .
up there , for christ sake !
you , of all people .
i hate to think of you alone in that room for a year .
well better think about it .
anyway , the room i' m stuck in is bigger than your tin cans .
you know what i' m saying .
what are you gonna do ?
i have my books .
i go places in my head .
that' d be help if you had some company .
i have visitors .
yeah well , none that you don' t pay .
i wouldn' t have it any other way .
seriously , what are you going to do ?
i' m going to finish this .
what' s titan like this time of year ?
what' s titan like ?
titan is exactly like this .
all the time , it' s got a cloud around that' s so thick , noone can tell what' s underneath .
maybe there' s nothing there .
there' s something there .
you should be going , instead of me .
why is that ?
' cause up there your legs wouldn' t matter .
i' m scared of heights .
i' m sorry .
do you want this ?
i' il save some for you , shall l ?
i' m so sorry .
i' m really , really sorry .
don' t give me a hard time .
give me a break .
come on !
help !
i' m sorry .
no , i wasn' t drunk . . .
what do you mean you' re not drunk ? . . . when i walked in front of that car .
what car ?
i stepped right out in front of it .
i' ve never been more sober in my life .
go to sleep .
i couldn' t even get that right , could i ?
if at first you don' t succeed , try , try again .
go to sleep .
i' m proud of you , vincent .
you must be drunk to call me vincent .
how much do you need ?
20 minutes .
you can go .
it' s all right , irene .
you' re excused .
we found our man .
it' s the only specimen in the entire place that can' t be accounted for .
every 10 years or so things go our way .
the eyelash , what do you know about it ?
it' s an unregistered in valid .
he was a janitor here untill a few years back , when he dissappeared out of sight .
what kind of specimen could last so many years since then .
well , take a look at the floor .
sir , i don' t think anything lies around here for very long .
it' s also the matter of loading .
is a janitor gonna come back here after all this time to kill a man he never knew ?
well , his profile does suggest a violent temperament .
if i' m not mistaken , his profile also suggests he' s a sick man .
there' s a 90 % chance the owner of this eylash has already died himself of natural causes .
that means there' s a 10 % chance he' s still alive .
it' s a lost and found case , sir .
all we have to do is find the man who' s minus an eylash and we have the murderer .
i' il do a cross check , i' il find out about his family . . .
already run it .
there' s no record of any living relative .
that' s a damn shame , sir .
i want you to check the entry log .
alibis , grudges .
i look around , i see a lot of dry eyes .
the mission director was not universally loved .
he was leading cutbacks in the programme .
with all due respect , sir . . .
whatever you say .
jerome the metronome .
i could play the piano by that heartbeat of his .
mr. director , you' d be pleased to know that we have a suspect .
that is a relief .
who is he ?
we found an unaccounted for specimen in the south wing .
here' s his picture .
an in valid .
we' re still following other leads .
be there as it may , i' m having this posted immediately .
i' m curious , director .
an advantage , i should imagine , in your line of work .
your hiring practices . . .
our " recruitment philosophy " .
who do you have to be , to be here ?
naturally , our standard is beyond that of the common citizen .
but amongst all that people you must have various levels of excellence .
occasionally we' ve had to accept candidates with minor shortcomings .
but nothing that would prohibit someone from working in a field such as law enforcement , for example .
now , there are enough of the right kind of people to warrant a new measuring stick .
bodies with minds to match .
essential , as we push out further and further .
yet you still constantly monitor performance .
you have to ensure the people are meeting their potential .
and exceeding it ?
no one exceeds his potential .
if he did ?
it would mean we did not accurately gauge his potential in the first place .
are you all right , jerome ?
terrific .
the entry log for the last 7 days .
what about you , irene ?
do you have an alibi ?
i was alone .
i find that hard to believe .
excuse me .
i' il take care of that for you , mr. morrow .
i see i' m not the only one who looks up every time there' s a launch .
hello jerome .
it' s awful about the director .
awful it didn' t happen sooner .
didn' t he threaten to cancel your mission more than once ?
somebody did you a favour .
do they have any idea whose hand i should be shaking ?
they found an eyelash in the s wing .
does it have a name ?
just some in valid .
jerome . . .
i had you sequenced .
i read your profile .
i' m sorry .
seems you' re everything they say you are and more .
what about you , irene ?
you' re engineered just like the rest of us .
not quite .
unacceptable likelihood of heart failure . " i think that' s what the manual says .
the only trip i' il take in space is around the sun on this satellite , right here .
if there' s anything wrong with you , i can' t see it from where i' m standing .
if you don' t believe me . . .
here .
take it .
if you' re still interested , let me know .
i' m sorry .
the wind caught it .
please check the latest gattaca bulletin .
jerome .
is this the approach path we discussed ?
absolutely , director .
quite right .
listen to what i' m saying to you , i want what i ordered .
it' s a completely different colour .
no .
i' m bored of talking to you .
i' m bored .
i' il call you back .
that was the company that sell us your hair dye .
they' ve sent me " summer wheat " instead of " honey dawn " .
any full tone is two shades light .
why don' t you try a change ?
i don' t want to change !
we can' t use a change !
now i' il probably gonna have to pay for the 5 boxes they' ve sent me .
we can' t stay here .
the idiots i have to deal with , you wouldn' t believe !
they think i killed the mission director .
what makes them think that ?
they found my eyelash .
where ?
in the corridor .
well , that could be worse .
they could have found it in your eye .
they' ve got my picture posted up all over the place .
i can' t turn around without seeing my own face .
they' il recognize me .
they won' t recognize you .
they will recognize me !
i don' t recognize you .
they won' t marry the eyelash to you ,
they won' t believe that one of their elite could' ve suckered them all this time .
no , we change nothing we do as we planned .
you' re jerome morrow , navigator 1st class .
i' m not jerome morrow .
i' m a murder suspect .
what are you doing ?
that' s more than a day' s worth !
wait .
we can' t stay here .
stop that !
oh fine , fine !
you leave if you want .
but you' re not taking that stuff .
that stuff is mine !
i could' ve rented myself somebody with a spine
if i' d known you' d go belly up on me at the last fuckin ' gasp .
you can' t quit on me now .
i' ve put too much into this .
what do you want me to do ?
wheel in there and finish the job myself ?
eugene , they are going to find me .
you still don' t understand , do you ?
when they look at you , they don' t see you any more .
they only see me .
keep your lashes on your lids where they belong .
how could you be so careless ?
i' m going out .
where are you going ?
well if i' m gonna get arrested tomorrow , i' m gonna go out tonight .
are you sure that' s a good idea to go out ?
that was your idea not to change anything .
who' s going ?
i' d say everybody .
if i don' t go it' il look suspicious .
you don' t want to look suspicious , do you ?
thanks .
who ordered this ?
what are we doing here ?
i' m following a lead .
forgive me , sir but that' s what i do .
i' m a detective .
i follow leads .
why makes you think the owner of the eyelash is here ?
he' s an in valid , sir .
this is where the in valids are .
he' s an in valid .
he' s an in valid clever enough to go unregistered all these years .
you think he' s likely to lie down for us now ?
what do you suggest , sir ?
move the inquiry back to the scene .
draw 5 mile radius around gattaca , sweep again .
random stops .
you' re a navigator ?
at gattaca ?
that' s what it says , doesn' t it ?
it doesn' t say you' re crippled .
i' m not crippled .
i hurt my leg training , you moron .
how dare you question me ?
what' s your number ?
no , what' s your number , you fucking flatfoot !
i said forget it .
what do you want ?
an apology ?
it gets to you , doesn' t it .
it gets to you that i can be where you can only dream of .
i' m getting off this ball of dirt !
how dare you question me !
that' s harassment .
my mistake .
what' s your number ?
may i remind you that this is a crime scene .
what' s this man doing here ?
what are you doing , old man ?
doing my job , sir .
this is evidence .
but it' s just trash .
you didn' t know ?
oh yes , yeah .
wonderful , wasn' t it ?
12 fingers or 1 , it' s how you play .
that piece can only be played with 12 .
what' s all this about ?
it' s probably nothing .
no , you better not .
i don' t want to give you a contaminated specimen .
get my meaning ?
thanks .
you never know where those swabs have been .
i want to show you something .
come on , we' il miss it .
come on .
we' il miss it .
what did i tell you ?
strange .
your eyes look different .
i guess it must be the light .
must be .
positive match .
i' m impressed .
the cup was definitely used since the original sweep ?
two samples , two days .
either the suspect went back to the scene of the crime to get a drink of water and i don' t know anybody that thirsty .
or he still works there .
i thought we checked all the service staff .
i don' t think he cleans up the place any more .
i have a feeling he might be there on a false pretense , playing somebody else' s hair .
a borrowed ladder at gattaca ?
that' s far fetched , but is not out of a possibility .
i find it hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers .
even if he got past their security system , he wouldn' t have the mental faculty or the physical stamina .
maybe you' re underestimating .
maybe he is an imposter and maybe the director found out about it .
that could be his motive .
i say we sample every employee within the parameters intravenously .
2/ 3 of their workforce fall in that category .
we' d be closing them down for days .
no , a fingertip sample or a urine should be sufficient .
i suggest blood from the vein .
i hope i' m not out of line .
it' s only a matter of time , sir .
what' s with the plungers , lamar ?
you' re openin ' up a blood bank ?
only the gentlemen from the law enforcement are concerned that my testing methods have been compromised .
goddamn !
i' m sorry .
are you out of practice , lamar ?
let me look at that .
it' s all right .
luckily , it looks as though we have enough .
well if you need any more , you can always get it off his shoes .
irene .
so you didn' t do it after all ?
i guess someone beat me to it .
i guess .
i leave in two days .
i guess you know that .
but . . .
that' s the last .
something' s not right .
he' s not here .
no , we miss something
i say we test again .
test ?
i cannot allow you to disrupt our operations any further .
you' re not at all concerned about having amurderer in your midst ?
now , your presence is creating more of a threat .
the window for our latest launch is open for seven days once every 70 years .
so it' s rather crucial we leave on time .
mission means a great deal to you , doesn' t it ?
your late colleague opposed it .
take another look at my profile .
you won' t find a violent bone in my body .
my apologies , director .
he won' t trouble you any further .
this is not the only place we can look .
ok , let' s start making the rounds .
i' m luckier than most .
not as lucky as some .
i know something about that .
you , jerome ?
what heart problem did you ever have ?
did you get yours broken once ?
i had this crazy idea that you were more interested in the murder case than me .
you' re right .
that' s a crazy idea .
would you like to dance ?
it' s funny .
you work so hard , you do everything you can to get away from a place . . .
and when you finally get your chance to leave , you find a reason to stay .
a year is a long time .
not so long .
just once around the sun .
hello , everyone , nice to see you , i' m your detective for the evening .
please don' t leave the premises .
i said nobody leave !
am i speaking in some kinda strange foreign language ?
check the hands , lenses , dentures , napkins , i want cigarette butts , the saliva off tea cups .
that' s a familiar face .
check him out .
i thought you wanted to dance .
where are you going ?
oh yeah ...
jerome !
are you insane ?
come on !
where did they go ?
come on .
don' t you understand , i can' t do that !
shh , you just did .
don' t touch your face . don' t swallow .
don' t spit .
let' s clean his teeth .
vincent !
vincent !
who' s vincent ?
i. . .
don' t say anything .
don' t say anything .
what happened ?
the scars on your legs ?
remember the ' 99 chrysler lebaron ?
this is the exact height of the front fender .
looked left instead of right .
did you just make that up or do you use all the time ?
i use it all the time .
i know you had something to do with the director' s death .
that' s not true , irene .
isn' t that the man from last night ?
he' s nobody .
he' s one of our best .
i' m certain he has nothing to do with this business .
jerome morrow .
you don' t look well , jerome .
why don' t you go home ?
can i help you ?
i' m looking for jerome morrow .
i' m sorry , he' s ill .
a little nausea .
it' s quite common before a mission .
i oughta pay him a visit .
i understand you can show me the way ?
you don' t know who he is , do you , irene ?
hello ?
eugene , i need you to be yourself for the day .
i was never very good at it , remember ?
the investigators are coming by .
i' m supposed to be sick .
so you keep telling me ?
how long have i got ?
not long .
i guess he' s not home .
i' m here to see jerome morrow .
that' s me .
come up .
i guess he' s home .
come in .
come in .
come in .
hello , sweetheart .
where' s my kiss ?
good to see you' re feeling better .
of course , now that you' re here .
who' s your friend ?
how can i help ?
it' s about the director .
again ?
i hope it' s no trouble .
no , no , no trouble .
forgive me for not giving your guided tour .
can' t we do this another time ?
this won' t take a moment .
maybe he can tell me why i' m ill .
who were you expecting ?
yes ?
we have our man , sir .
you have him ?
we have him in custody .
i' il come right away .
how are you , jerome ?
not bad , jerome .
how the hell did you get up here ?
i can always walk .
i' ve been faking it .
irene . . .
don' t touch me !
listen to me , irene !
i don' t even know who you are .
i' m the same person i was yesterday .
i can' t hear anymore of your lies , jerome .
my name is vincent anton freeman .
and i' m a faith birth or a de gene erate or whatever you wanna call it .
but i' m not a murderer .
you' re a god child ?
well we do have one thing in common .
only i don' t have 20 30 years left in mine .
mine is already 10, 000 beats overdue .
it' s not possible .
you are the authority on what is not possible ,
aren' t you , irene ?
they' ve got you looking so hard for any flaw , that after a while that' s all that you see .
for whatever it' s worth , i' m here to tell you that it is possible .
it is possible .
congratulations , sir .
we did it .
his spit was found in the dead director' s eye .
an unaccounted specimen .
while i was busy obsessing about an eyelash , your instincts took us in the right direction .
so the in valid had nothing to do with this ?
no , our friend here acted alone .
this mission meant everything to him , didn' t it ?
he knows that if they miss this launch window he wouldn' t live to see the next one .
and since nothing can stop the launch now , he' s being very , very cooperative .
so , i imagin you' il be celebrating tonight , sir ?
of course .
i think she likes us .
yeah , sure , just give her a little time and she' il get used to the idea .
what was he like ?
who , the cop ?
yeah .
he was just a cop .
did you catch his name ?
actually my name was the topic of conversation .
yeah well , he' il be back .
you heard what he said , they have their man .
it' s over .
no , it' s not over .
i have to meet him .
vincent ?
my god , you have changed .
has it been so long , you don' t recognize your own brother ?
are we brothers ?
our parents both died thinking they' d outlived ya .
i had my doubts .
what are you doing here , anton ?
i should ask you that question .
i have a right to be here .
you don' t .
you almost sound as if you believe that .
i committed no murder .
you must be disappointed .
you committed fraud .
listen , you' re in a lot of trouble , vincent .
i can get you out of here .
do you have any idea what it took to get in here ?
you' ve gone as far as you can go .
you come with me now !
there' s still a few million miles left to go .
it' s over .
is that the only way you can succeed , is to see me fail ?
i' m telling you ...
god !
even you are going to tell me what i can and can' t do now ?
in case you haven' t noticed , i don' t need any rescuing .
but you did , once .
you' ve got all the answers , how do you explain that ?
you didn' t beat me that day .
i beat myself .
who are you trying to convince ?
do you want me to prove it to you ?
it' s not important , anton .
it' s forgotten .
i' il prove it to you .
do you want me to prove it to you ?
i' il prove it to you !
i do .
vincent !
vincent !
where' s the shore ?
we' re too far out !
do you wannna quit ?
we' repbr too far out !
do you wanna quit ?
no .
vincent !
how are you doing this , vincent ?
how have you done any of this ?
we have to go back .
no .
it' s too late for that .
we' re close to the other side .
what other side ?
do you want to drown us both ?
you want to know how i did it ?
this is how i did it , anton .
i never saved anything for the swim back .
you couldn' t see , could you ?
that night , crossing the street .
you crossed anyway .
if you' re still interested , let me know .
sorry . . .
the wind caught it .
you' re flying today , aren' t you ?
look at what a mess you' re in .
come on , i have your samples ready .
i don' t need any samples where i' m going .
you might when you get back .
everything you need to last you two lifetimes .
why have you done all this ?
so jerome will always be here when you need him .
where are you going ?
i' m travelling , too .
i don' t know how to thank you .
no , no . . .
i got the better end of the deal .
i only lent you my body .
you lent me your dream .
not until you' re upstairs .
what is this ?
new policy .
flight got you nervous ?
there' s a problem , lamar .
i never did tell you about my son , did i ?
he' s a big fan of yours .
just remember that i was as good as any and better than most .
he wants to apply here .
i could have gone up and back and nobody wouldn' t have been the wiser .
unfortunately , my son' s not all that they promised .
but then , who knows what he could do ?
right ?
for future reference , right handed men don' t hold it with their left .
just one of those things .
you' re going to miss your flight , vincent .
for someone who was never meant for this world ,
i must confess , i' m suddenly having a hard time leaving it .
of course , they say every atom in our bodies was once part of a star .
maybe i' m not leaving .
maybe i' m going home .
