robert , i' m home !
sweetie ... where are you ?
i made the delivery for the saenz lady .
i got soaked .
all for nothing .
she didn' t pay .
she told me her husband has also been fired .
he' s useless .
she says she' il manage to pay me next week .
roca didn' t pay either .
she made me show her three different creams and then she tried all the mascaras and rouge .
when i left , she was made up like a clown and she didn' t even buy a little brush .
we have so many shampoos and little soaps .
i don' t know who' s gonna buy them .
i spent the whole day working and i got no orders .
have you eaten ?
you' re staining the spread .
come on !
come to bed !
come to bed !
i don' t like it when you smell of wine .
honestly , sandra , you can do better .
tonight you only opened your mouth to say " i' m sleepy " .
you could' ve been nicer to the mexican guy .
and you didn' t have to be so friendly to his wife .
she' s not his wife .
she' s a girl i got him .
i' m working for you .
i always work for you .
you' re always on my mind .
are you jealous ?
i' m negotiating a deal with telemundo for a 300 episode soap opera and you can' t stand the guy who' s gonna pay 1 million dollars so that you can do what you want .
you know what that means ?
yes , i know .
the slobbering star will go on slicking his tongue in my mouth in every love scene .
who the hell asked you to do anything ?
don' t fuck with me .
do you know what it means to get into the latino market ?
it' s the most important production company in la .
they want to make a movie with you as a star .
you instead of sandra bullock .
ever heard of her ?
well , they prefer a latin american actress .
did you imagine this when you lived in villa adela ?
and they wanna sell a doll with your face and your own perfume .
i' il tell you who' s working in the film they want to make .
my dad was the director of the william shakespeare
theater company in arroyo seco .
he loved classics .
he named my eldest brother mark anthony , the other brother
romeo , and me , cleopatra .
my younger sister was going to be
electra , but she was dead when she born .
i know i have to live up to my name and i could be disappointed , but i' m not .
i still hope to be able to do wonderful things .
and learn more than i do now .
my dad used to say that i would be a good actress .
i wanted to be an actress , to be somebody else .
but i was already roberto' s girlfriend and he didn' t let me .
so i became a teacher .
which is similar in a way .
you say something and other people listen to you .
my daugher , nancy , got married , lives in the us and has two kids .
and my son robertito , who lives in spain and sells handicraft on the beach .
he made this .
i' ve been married for 37 years .
2 and a half years ago roberto was fired from the factory the same month i retired .
he didn' t expect that .
at first he looked for a job .
with roberto' s severance pay we opened a grocery store .
but soon a supermarket opened opposite our store .
with the little money we still had , we bought a taxi which was stolen before we could insure it .
since i retired i worked as a private teacher ,
i sewed , i made home made cakes , flower arrangements .
i' m selling make up door to door .
i can separate my fingers by one , by two ;
i can also move my eyes to the side , this one or this one , or both , and move my head without moving my body .
that' s why i started to care for children and old people .
but the children grew up , and the old people ...
my friend used to say that i was born to be a clown .
poor thing , she died .
but that' s another story .
a gigolo .
that' s what i am .
an old gigolo .
i' m useless .
i can' t even get a job as a laborer .
if i had known at this age i' d be supported by a woman .
i' m not any woman .
i' m your wife .
you' il throw that in my face one day .
it always happens .
you' re already doing that so ...
robert , think of only one thing : ... everything we have .
we have each other , the kids , our grandchildren .
we did so many wonderful things .
we have loved each other so much .
promise me you' re gonna go on fighting .
come on , robert .
look at a half full glass , not at a half empty one .
it' s empty now .
hi .
nancy , baby !
nancy !
what a surprise , darling !
yes !
how are you ?
how are the kids ?
billy ?
a tooth ?
and elenita ?
dad' s ok .
yes , dad' s working too .
because they changed his shift .
yes , with overtime .
he' s quite happy .
very happy .
yes , yes .
yes .
okay , okay ...
i' il tell him you called .
did robertito call you ?
he didn' t call me this month .
i' m not worried .
if he calls you , tell him to call me .
all right .
can i talk to elenita ?
i' m dying to hear her voice .
hello ?
elenita !
yes , helen , helen .
how are you ?
the school ?
how is the school ?
the blackboard , the pupil ...
yes .
the " gran padre " is very good .
very good .
yes , dear .
he call you , he call you .
i' il tell him .
me too .
kiss , kiss , kiss .
it seems mrs. saenz will get me a role in this soap opera .
she knows deep inside i' m an actress .
she told me to go to audition .
it' s easy .
i have to study a text .
i know a lot of poems .
if things are transparent and clean , this time i think i' il get it .
me , on tv ...
i' m a bit scared .
i haven' t acted for a long time !
well , i never acted , actually ...
i need a push .
who knows ?
maybe i end up being famous and we can move .
i told you not to leave food there ...
the roaches ...
terrible things happen in life !
terrible things happen in life !
i don' t know ...
terrible things .
terrible things ...
terrible things happen in life ...
i don' t know .
terrible things happen in life ...

who sent this dork ?
i don' t know .

it doesn' t matter if you don' t remember the text .

here it says she was classically trained .
that' s a relief .
please , turn around .
the other way .
dinner is ready " .
thanks .
we might call you .
ma' am .
she came to audition and she was so scared she peed .
and who was she ?
an old woman .
she' il never forget it .
don' t worry , nobody can tell .
don' t pay attention to them .
don' t make their day .
don' t cry .
don' t cry .
they' re waiting for you .
let them wait .
i have to go .
lf you ever need anything , come and see me .
thanks .
do you know who i am ?
you have a nice look in your eyes .
how much longer ?
when will you realize you' re with a man who' s worthless ?
why did you have to beat the guy ?
they came to cut the power .
and they did .
i know , mecha told me .
the money was inside the sewing case .
lf i had known ...
lf i " had known " ...
what ?
had known .
fuck me !
did you hear ?
fuck me !
so many sacrifices ...
and for what ?
we have a daughter who left us .
and a son ...
please !
you can' t stand the truth .
please .
ma' am , could you come in ?
i' il go .
robert , where are you ?
robert !
robert ?
why are you talking like that ?
sometimes you make me laugh .
where are you ?
enough , robert !
you' ve drunken enough .
let' s go to bed .
you' ve drunk enough ...
you talk to me as if i were a piece of shit .
i can' t find the candles .
where did i put them ?
leave me alone .
please .
you don' t like me anymore ?
not when you' re drunk .
who' s drunk ?
you !
come here !
let me go .
let go of me !
don' t do this to me !
don' t , robert !
not like this !
not like this !
it' s a wonderful time for my career .
i have many projects and great possibilities .
are you making a movie in the us ?
that' s what my producer says .
you can interview him .
he' s here .
you' il easily persuade him .
bye boys , thanks .
sandrita , just one minute .
i' m tired , francis .
i was telling mercedes you have great news for her .
just two minutes for latino entertainment network .
ready ?
sandra , instead of talking about your projects , why don' t you tell us about your most intimate dreams ?
i love it .
they always ask me the same .
you aren' t original at all .
now it' s latino entertainment network' s turn .
i honestly don' t know what they expect me to say .
my dream is like anybody' s dream .
my life maybe different , but my real dream is similar to anybody' s .
my assistant , the make up lady , the cleaning lady , my classmates at school in villa adela , soap opera characters , my mum ...
we all dream the same .
that somebody will love us .
but not all of them dream of working for telemundo or shooting a movie with andy garcia .
you' re right .
me neither .
you have the most important latin american tv channel and you say such nonsense .
you' re crazy !
who are you to tell me what to do ?
who am i ?
who brougth you here from that boring town and made you a star ?
a star , my ass !
in a week you' il be in miami ... ... to sign the contract to work with andy garcia .
what is it with you ?
that' s new .
what' s wrong , honey ?
why don' t you tell me what you want ?
do you really wanna know ?
i don' t want to sign squatt .
i wanna get rid of the mexican , andy garcia .
fuck miami , the doll , the perfume and all the fake guys like you !
i' m tired !
i can' t stand this anymore .
sandra ...
i' il get the car and we' il talk .
sandra ...
it' s you , isn' t it ?
i think so .
you told me if i ever needed anything ... yes , hop on .
what was your name ?
cleopatra .
cleopatra ?
my dad was the director of the william shakespeare theater ...
company in arroyo seco .
he loved classics .
he named my elder brother ...
what are you gonna do ?
i have two options : do what i want or what i have to .
and do you know what you want ?
then you' d better don' t do anything .
eat an " empanada " .
thank you .
cleopatra ...
excuse me .
what do you call me for ?
no , i' m not home .
really ?
ask the mexican whore to sign that .
get it ?
now he' s desperate to make me sign .
he' s realized he can' t control me .
francis ?
can you hear me ... ?
my battery needs recharging .
the call will be cut off .
it was cut off .
well , i' m leaving .
no , why ?
do you know what it is ?
no .
me neither .
francis brought it from south africa and put it here .
if i touch it , he' il kill me .
everything is his ...
the apartment , the furniture ... ... my haircut , my eyes , my clothes ...
my famous cleavage ...
i' m a trademark .
i' m his possession .
didn' t you like the " empanadas " ?
yes !
i' il be right back .
i love massages .
i know how to massage .
i used to do that .
my daughter nancy liked me to massage her feet while she read her university notes in a loud voice and then recite them to me .
does she live with you ?
no .
she moved to the states with her husband .
he couldn' t find a job here .
what does your son do ?
robertito ?
he also left .
he left .
but he' s different .
he' s been different since he was a child .
a very good person and a bit sad .
his dad forced him to play rough games , " male games " , he' d say .
he never understood him .
though he says it' s not true , he stopped loving him .
i can understand him better than anybody else , just by looking at him .
once he had an argument with my husband and he left .
i helped him with some money i had saved .
he left with a friend who had found a job in spain .
now he writes to me , calls me whenever he can .
when i can , i call him too .
he sounds good .
but i miss him a lot , more and more every day .
do you like ice cream ?
yes .
hi , guido .
hi .
thanks .
that' s ok .
can you sign this ?
i already did .
it' s for romina , my girlfriend .
turn around .
romina ?
yes .
and this one' s for amelia , the baker .
she doesn' t believe i know you .
the ice cream' s gonna melt .
bye .
thanks .
i can' t really say he' s a bad guy , but he doesn' t know how to treat women .
he doesn' t do it on purpose , he' s just a bit brutish .
you' re talking about francis ?
my dad .
and her ?
his wife ?
we don' t get along at all .
she smokes , drinks gin ...
and she has an obsession : my dad .
they started dating before my parents got divorced .
nobody told me but i saw them together in the car .
dad loves cars .
son of a bitch !
your dad ?
francis .
you' il think i' m mixing everything , but i can' t separate things .
i' m like that , a bit nuts .
crazy " sounds better .
some things i do better than others .
don' t worry , me too .
but nobody realizes .
the same happens to me .
good morning ...
hi .
may i use your phone ?
sure .
did you sleep well ?
yes .
are you going on a trip ?
yes .
use that one .
you have some messages .
yes , but don' t touch them .
are you calling your husband ?
tell him to give you a break .
a break ?
yes , maternity leave .
what a mess !
would you like me to pack your backpack ?
first , the heavy stuff ...
how nice !
and fold it well or everything will be wrinkled .
look what you' ve done to your hair !
don' t you like it ?
yes ...
but you' re crazy !
well , take care .
promise you' il take care .
you too .
next time you pee on the floor , call me .
stop here , please .
bye .
bye .
what is it ?
i forgot my glasses at your place , my purse , everything .
hop on .
you must want to kill me .
i' m sorry .
relax .
we' il buy another pair .
buy another pair ?
we' il leave now .
where ?
to hell .
where ?
anywhere .
don' t you dare ?
no , you don' t .
forget it .
maybe you' re right ...
it must be difficult for you to forget about everything .
even for two days .
your home , your husband ...
the same clothes , no glasses ... no purse ...
what ?
may i use your cell phone ?
thanks .
hi , robert .
how are you ?
did you sleep well ?
no , i' m in the street .
no , from a cell phone .
it doesn' t matter who it belongs to .
what' s the problem ?
ok ...
ok ... let me talk .
i' m very glad there was no power .
now you' il get away from that tv set .
only soccer and awful soap operas .
you watch so much tv your head is square .
i don' t know what you can do .
if you' re bored , go take a bath , go for a walk ,
look for a job .
ok , robert ...
ok .
robert ...
i can' t hear you .
can you hear me ?
i can' t hear you .
it' s going to cut off .
my battery needs recharching .
it' s going to be cut off .
it cut off .
well ... here we go !
just two women alone in the world .
do you like this music ?
not at all , but don' t worry .
if you like it ...
hi !
good morning .
good afternoon .
is there anything to eat ?
ask him if there are any free tables .
even if nobody believes it , i love francis .
but he' s been so bad to me .
he' s the producer , he' s made me famous , i' m supposed to be tolerant .
i introduced him to my dad .
they got along from the very beginning .
they' re both seductive , fake guys .
let me try .
yes , didn' t know you smoked .
me neither .
so ?
so nothing .
i wanted to have a producer , get out of my town , appear in magazines .
you' re lucky you' re an actress .
you can get into de soul of your characters .
you can be somebody else .
i didn' t want to be an actress .
i wanted to be famous and i wanted my mom to see me .
two coffees and the check .
i' il be right back .
there' s no coffee .
what does it say here ?
sallads : two .
does it say " sallads " ?
who wrote this ?
barvecue " .
i' ve never seen that .
no offense was meant .
tell me , how do you spell " vomit " ?
your daughter' s vomiting in the restroom .
what is it ?
sandra , what is it ?
look , lady ,
let' s be clear .
it' s not the girl' s fault but the mother' s .
mother' s and commercials ' .
adults have to be careful .
you must be careful .
but i ...
excuse me ?
yes , i' il be careful .
are you feeling better ?
can i tell you something ?
no .
what a mess i got you in .
no .
you' re in a mess .
you shouldn' t do that .
you know what i mean .
it' s dangerous .
where are we ?
i' d like to know .
i don' t know .
at least we' re far from that horrible place .
that waiter , " barvecue " ...
so bitter ...
we' il never come back there .
i forgot my cell in the restroom .
and it' s the first time i' ve driven .
roberto never let me .
in arroyo seco , my dad used to sit me on his lap and i' d practise .
but i never drove again .
the taxi lasted us a day .
my dad said i was a very good driver but that i just got a bit distracted .
and you were going to be careful .
this time nothing serious happened .
but young lady , remember that at certain age , children stop being children and become their own parents ' parents .
such is life .
did you understand , darling ?
your mom isn' t young anymore ...
i' m not young anymore but i' m not old either .
and i don' t like when people say " darling " or " love " if it' s not true .
those words should be said when you mean them .
bye , darling , take care .
anybody comes now and kisses you .
it' s a bit disgusting .
how are we gonna go back now ?
where ?
that' s what i' m wondering .
where ?
to go back or not to go back .
that is the question .
what are you going to do ?
come with me .
and the van ?
i left it at the mechanic' s .
it' s francis problem .
was it his ?
what are you doing ?
let the old creep wear it .
he' s exaggerating .
it was nothing .
darling , darling " .
go kiss yourself !
what ?
i think that crash helped me .
you' re nuts !
do you still think they' d stop as soon as they saw you ?
let me do it .
with short hair , i' m nobody .
nobody recognizes me .
who knows how long we' il be here .
come , sandrita !
this boy is humanitarian and will give us a lift .
so you were in a crash ...
what happened ?
i don' t want to remember .
who was driving ?
i don' t want to remember , i told you .
hitchhiking is dangerous .
there' s nobody out there .
when somebody sees two women alone , they say " be careful , it' s dangerous " .
can you turn that down ?
well , he' s right , in a way .
the driver could be a murderer .
not a murderer .
a rapist .
ma' am , i was just joking .
sure , joking !
i don' t need a funny guy !
put yourself in her shoes .
you scared her .
can' t you see she' s an old lady ?
she could' ve died .

i raise horses .
it was my father' s job .
is it a nice place ?
i haven' t been there .
you' d get bored .
what do you know ?
did you recognize me ?
what ?
i don' t know anything about you but i can imagine by looking at you .
and what can you imagine ?
nothing .
i don' t want to put my foot in my mouth again .
come on .
no , i' m not good at that .
you said you could imagine .
i thought that since you' re from the capital city ...
besides , you' re a bit wild for town life .
you' re wrong .
what did you say ?
wild " .
that' s what we call the mares that rear ...
with all due respect .
you' re comparing me to a mare .
i want to sleep .

because i can .
only i get distracted .

milagros is a nice name .
francis never liked it .

cleopatra ...

everybody knows me here , and if they get a hold of me ...

thanks .
like a forest path that disappears in the distance my life is fading away while i keep searching .
i' ve searched in the wilderness , i' ve searched blindly .
i' ve been searching for a way out all my life without realizing .
i' ve been searching for a way out .

the male star was the surgeon , typical ...
and at the end ...

those geese aren' t mine , they' re aitor' s .

let' s go for a walk .
tell me something .
like what ?
i don' t know .
anything .
something from your childhood .
look ...
that is where my brother was shot .
it was an accident .
they had been hunting and were cleaning the rifles .
his name was cesarito , he was 14 .
my mom went crazy .
dad didn' t know what to do , how to comfort her .
we left overnight , as if we had all died .
i don' t know what' s wrong with the truck .
wait .
i' m sorry .
i thought it' d be good for you to stay here .
you think you have a right to everything .
you' re right .
i have no rights .
next week i have to go to miami .
anyway , your face has changed since we got here .
those little horses ...
when i was a child , i used to play with them .
i hadn' t seen them in a long time .
do you like this music ?
it' s what my grandpa used to listen to .
do you wanna know what it says ?
on this rough land ... my mother gave me life .
and the land didn' t give me the woman i love .
i' m going to the garden .
my beloved one is there
among birds who sing so beautifully .
all my love calls her from my heart .
calls her
like the birds who sing so beautifully .
calls her like the birds who sing so beautifully .
on this rough land where i was born .
nice , isn' t it ?
they were two cousins , pocho and toto .
pocho was a saint , toto , a bastard .
pocho studied to be a lathe operator and works very hard .
toto does odd jobs , he' s so lazy .
pocho bought a motor bike ,
toto doesn' t even have money to buy condoms .
don' t tell me , you chose toto .
and i' m 3 months pregnant .
if you let him beat you now , you' il end up in hospital .
you have to do something !
that' s easy to say , but when toto gets mad ...
i' m not saying it' s easy but you can' t let him beat you .
look at your face .
he could hurt the baby ...
what should i do ?
what should i do ?
pay attention .
you have to tell him ...
toto !
toto !
yes , what is it ?
do you know what the police do te men who beat women ?
no .
i' m a doctor .
i got my degree many years ago , in cordoba .
that' s where i met the owner of this house .
he came to the mountains , and so did i.
he burned his bridges and so did i.
he got married but was never happy .
me neither .
actually , i' m not being fair .
i shouldn' t be talking like that .
i realized i hadn' t been happy when i got the chance to be happy .
you' re surprised , aren' t you ?
i made you think .
don' t worry .
my dad used to tell me to think more often .
think " , he said , " use your head , think of what you want .
but i was always busy and i didn' t pay attention to him .
i never thought what i wanted to do or what i felt .
no , no ...
it all started four years ago , in new york .
i had been married for many years .
my wife , carmen , had always been sick .
then i met viviana at a medical conference .
she was married and she was working as a translator .
it was love at first sight and we lived ten days full of intensity and anxiety .
we didn' t know we would see each other two more times .
i sent viviana a plane ticket to new york
to see her .
we had a date at the same hotel and room we had the first time .
when the day arrived ,
i said goodbye to carmen and told her i was going to another congress .
and i left .
i went to the airport and i sat at the departure lounge to wait for my flight to new york to be announced .
i listened to each of the five announcements , until they finally called me personally .
when the plane took off ,
i went home and had dinner with carmen , as usual .
i never knew if she had guessed it .
some months later , my wife died in her sleep , without suffering more than having to deal with her secrets and mine .
after a year
i couldn' t help myself , picked up the phone and called viviana , but the number was no longer hers .
things were like that and ended like that .
at least i was with carmen and accompanied her until the end in those painful critical moments of suspecting compassion .
i' m sorry , but did you love your wife or the other one ?
love ?
i did what was expected of me .
i have a clean conscience .
i don' t know if i did what was right or what was wrong .
i will go on living with that doubt .
what about you ?
what about me ?
are you married ?
your husband is lucky .
do you think so ?
yes , he' s happy because i love him , but i used to love him more .
i' il tell you something .
i lied to you .
i' m not an actress .
my dad was the director of the william shakespeare theater company in arroyo seco , where i was born .
i remember some excerpts from plays by heart .
little texts .
terrible things happen in life .
i don' t know ...
as if they were the wrath of god , as if before them everything one has suffered would get hold of your soul .
there are not many , but they exist .
they open dark marks in the rudest face and on the strongest back .
maybe they are the horses of attilas , or the black heralds sent to us by death .
those bloody things hitting us are the crepitations of some bread burning in an oven .
and man ... poor , poor man turns his eyes , as when somebody laps your shoulder ; he turns his crazy eyes and everything he has lived gets hold of his soul ,
like a guilt pond in his eyes .
terrible things happen in life ...
i don' t know .
i said it !
like a forest path that disappears in the distance .
my life is fading away while i keep searching .
i' ve searched among the trees i' ve searched blindly .
i' ve been searching for a way out all my life without realizing .
i' ve been searching for a way out , i' ve searched for my destiny .
i' ve searched blindly .
dreaming of an open forest and an immense sky that dazzies me .
deep inside , a woman' s waiting .
it' s myself , a heart awaits .
it' s my own heart and i' m filled with joy .
so full of joy .
so full of joy .
oh , what a moment .
oh , what a moment for my feelings to come out freely .
oh , what a moment .
oh , what a moment for my feelings to come out freely .
yes , robert , yes .
and the kids ?
did the kids call ?
no , i' m still here .
yes .
yes , robert , i heard you .
i heard what you said .
that everything will be like it was before .
before when ?
what are you doing , sweetie ?
what is it ?
nothing .
what are you going to do ?
i' m going back .
i' m leavin for buenos aires in an hour .
and i think ...
i' m going back alone , right ?
i would' ve liked you to be my mom .
these are for your husband .
thank you !
bye .
you taught me a lot in these days .
i don' t like farewells .
let' s go .
now i have three choices : do what i must do , do what i want or do nothing and sit down to think .
like a forest path that disappears in the distance , my life is fading away while i keep searching .
i' ve searched among the trees , i' ve searched blindly .
i' ve been searching for a way out all my life without realizing .
i' ve been searching for a way out my destiny ...
i' ve searched blindly
dreaming of an open forest and an immense sky that dazzies me .
deep inside , another woman' s waiting .
it' s myself , a heart awaits .
it' s my own heart and i' m filled with joy .
so full of joy .
so full of joy .
oh , what a moment .
oh , what a moment for my feelings to come out freely .
oh , what a moment .
oh , what a moment for my feelings to come out freely .
i' ve been searching for a way out withing my soul i' ve searched blindly .
i want life to knock me off my feet .
i' ve searched among the trees i' ve searched blindly .
i' ve been searching for a way out all my life without realizing .
so full of joy .
so full of joy .
oh , what a moment .
oh , what a moment for my feelings to come out freely .
oh , what a moment .
oh , what a moment for my feelings to come out freely .
so full of joy .
so full of joy .
oh , what a moment .
oh , what a moment for my feelings to come out freely .
so full of joy .
so full of joy .
oh , what a moment .
oh , what a moment for my feelings to come out freely .
