thank you , mrs. helperman .
it' s just the thing ... to compliment my math medal , history medal ... and science medal .

fourth grade , principal strickler .
but soon to be fifth grade !
that' s why i' m glad i' m a principal .
none of this messy student/ teacher involvement .
they grow , they leave good riddance .
but i suppose it is just that sort of ... bushy gushy loving teacher stuff ... that leads to this announcement .
hmph !
mrs. mary lou helperman , you have been selected ... as a finalist for the teacher of the year award !
neato !
that' s right , it' s the n. e. a. t. o. the national excellent american teacher organization award !

they' re the only eyes i got , leonard .
the eyes of a dog a dog who' s not going anywhere .
just staying home ...
by himself ... here ... alone !
the dog .
but you' re not going to be alone .
you' ve got pretty boy and jolly ... and mrs. boogin' s the nicest pet sitter in the whole world .
and besides , it' s only for two weeks .
yeah , in boy time , two weeks ... but everything in dog time is seven times longer ... so for me it' s fourteen weeks .
it might as well be forever .
man , this really stinks .
you should smell it from down here .
ok , just two weeks , then i' m back ... and it' s you and me , best friends ... together , all summer long .

it' s so simple , and yet so utterly brilliant !

you' re not a boy , scott .
you' re a man .
i' m a man ?
i don' t understand .
how could i be a man ?
great balls of kibble !
i forgot all about dog time !
that' s right !
one human year equals seven dog years .
that would make you ...
don' t do the math .
uh , it' s not exactly what i had planned , but i' m human ... and that' s nothing to shake your tail at .
how can i thank you ?
oh , it will be thanks enough ... that you spend the rest of your life ... traveling around the world with me ... as living proof of my genius !
ah .
well , uh , gee , fun as that sounds for me ...
i' m afraid i' m gonna have to pass .
i can' t spend the rest of my life with you .
l l i live with this guy ... at his house , in his room .
i sleep on the bottom bunk .
heh .
although , now that i' m a big , grown man ... with knuckle hair and uhh lower back pain ... that may present a slight problem .
but we' il cross that bridge when we come to it .
let' s go , leonard !

um , all i' ve got is this , uh ... slimy old dog chew toy and a shiny new nickel .
mm hmm .
ohh ... holding out on me , huh ?
hey , give me that chew toy !
ok , let' s see now .
decode secret password , override security check ... bypass concealed alarm cookie , and ... bingo !
wow !
how did you do that ?
oh , come on .
this was easy .
reprogramming the queen' s toilets ... for a 21 flush salute now , that was hard .
thanks , lan .
thank you , stranger .
you' re welcome , stranger .
well , as long as i' m here ...
hee hee hee .

oh , don' t blame them , uncle lvan .
i let ' em go .
ah ! lan !
ahh !
lan , my darling nephew ... the only one who ever truly believed in me .

however , now that you' ve ruined everything ...
i must ground you for the rest of the summer .
so go to your room .
don' t come out till labor day !
yes , uncle lvan .

jeez , i could' ve saved a bus ride .
what was i so afraid of all these years ?

# put a shirt on your back and a shine on your shoe #
# when the cash shows up , i don' t say " boo " #

# when the money shows up , baby , don' t say " boo " #
# just take the money and run , oh , yeah #
# take the money and run #

after all the trouble mr. manly manning has gone to ... the least we can do is invite him in for a cup of coffee .
coffee ?
i' ve always wanted to try coffee .
boy , it' s true what they say !
what a beverage !
who' d believe that little brown bean from brazil ... could pack such mellow , rich roasting ... good to the last drop flavor ?
by the way ... were you aware that it was our 26th president
theodore " teddy " roosevelt who originally coined the phrase " good to the last drop " ?
little known fact , but true .
yes , i think one of my students mentioned that once .
i can' t remember which one .
you can' t remember which one ?
for cryin ' out loud , it' s obviously
time for you to go now .
what a shame .
thanks for stopping by .
see you later .
hey !

we can stop worrying how i' m gonna live ... and where i' m gonna sleep ... and how we' re gonna stay together .
i' ve stumbled upon the answer , and it doesn' t even matter ... that i' m a hairy knuckled grownup with back pain .
ooch !
ln fact , it works to our advantage !
you' re kidding !
of course , i won' t be sleeping at the bottom bunk anymore ... but i promise i' il tuck you in and tell you a bedtime story ... before i settle in to watch the 9 : 00 news with ...

# though money may be #
# the root of all evil #
# money , it might not buy you love #
# money won' t bring you happiness #
# or grow new hair or cure your stress #
# won' t get you to the pearly gates above #
# but there' s a bunch of things that money can do #
# put a shirt on your back and a shine on your shoe #
# when the cash shows up , i don' t say " boo " #
# i take the money and run #
# ' cause love can' t buy a fancy car #
# or fill your tank #
# lf you want the finer things #
# you' d better break the bank #
# ' cause if there' s one sure thing that money can do #
# put the pedal to the metal when the rent comes due #
# when the money shows up , baby , don' t say " boo " #
# just take the money and run #
# oh , yeah , take the money and run #
# go , man , grab your stash , get your cash #
# we' re gonna have a bash #
# take the money and run #
