i' m so tired .
just a little .
don' t drink too much .
i don' t want you drinking any more .
i don' t want you cramping up .
you' re humping too much stuff , troop .
you don' t need half this shit .
i' il haul it for you , but next time you check with me first , all right ?

two two , this is six .

damn , you dumb !
it don' t make no difference .

she don' t read too good nohow !

hey , white boy ... what you waiting for ?
that hole ain' t gonna dig itself .
come on , get your dick skin on that thing !
dig !
you ain' t got all day !
dig !
dig !
hell is the impossibility of reason .
that' s what this place feels like hell .
i hate it already and it' s only been a week .
some goddamn week , grandma .
the hardest thing i' ve ever done is go on point .
three times this week .
i don' t know what i' m doing .
a gook could be three feet in front of me and i wouldn' t know it .
i' m so tired .
we get up at 5am , hump all day , camp around four or five , dig a foxhole , eat , then put out an all night ambush or a three man listening post .
it' s scary cos nobody tells me how to do anything , cos i' m new .
nobody cares about new guys .
they don' t even wanna know your name .
a new guy' s life isn' t worth as much cos he hasn' t put his time in yet .
they say if you' re gonna get killed , it' s better to get it in the first few weeks .
the logic being you don' t suffer that much .
if you' re lucky , you stay in the perimeter , then you pull a three hour guard shift .
maybe you sleep three , four hours a night ...
but you don' t really sleep .
i don' t think i can keep this up for a year , grandma .
i think i' ve made a big mistake coming here .
we got boo coo movement .
third battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here .
charlie had claymores in the trees , blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces .
bad shit .
yeah .
they got two lieutenants and a captain .
all right , sergeant , who do you want on ambush ?
elias ... you take your squad out .
warren , you stay in , but i' il need tex and junior from your squad .
roger that .
ok , move out in two zero mikes .
i thought it was o' neill' s turn .
no !
tubbs and morehouse are short .
fu sheng' s on an r and r tomorrow , and you wanna send them out on an ambush ?
you got the fresh meat , buddy .
they don' t know shit , and chances are we' re gonna run into something .
what do you want me to do ?
send one of my guys to get zapped , so some lame ass can get his beauty sleep ?
o' neill ...
take a break !
you don' t have to be a prick every day of your life !
elias , get your men ready .
he' s in three years and thinks he' s jesus fucking christ !
o' neill , your short timers stay in , but you go out .
i need veterans out there .
sergeant barnes .
i think , in front of the men , it' s necessary for me to give the orders .
yes , sir .
shit , looks like it' s gonna rain .
it' s gonna piss on us all night .
i' m gonna put a serious case of crotch rot on that ugly face of yours , junior .
goddamn , man !
you break your ass for the white man !
no justice around here !
what' s o' neill got ?
a nose up the lieutenant' s ass already ?
how come we always get fucking ambush ?
cos it' s politics , man , politics .
chris , show you a picture of lucy jean ?
no , you didn' t .
she' s the one for me all right , that lucy jean .
she' s waiting for me .
real pretty .
you' re a lucky guy , gardner .
hey , you got a picture of your girl ?
i guess that leaves some unlucky girl back at home , don' t it ?
tuck this in .
shitcan this .
don' t need this .
turn around .
come on .
tex , you got junior and taylor here on your position .
goddamn it , elias , don' t mess with my pig !
i ain' t getting greased , so you keep this sorry cheese dick off my ass !
you got taylor .
gardner , you' re with me .
look , case anything happens , you get lost or separated , don' t yell out , ok ?
just sit tight and we' il get to you .
saddle up !
lock and load !
mom and dad didn' t want me to come here .
they wanted me to be like them . : respectable , hard working , a family .
they drove me crazy with their goddamn world , grandma .
you know mom .
i' ve always been sheltered .
i just wanna be anonymous like everybody else , do my share for my country .
live up to what grandpa did in the first war , and dad did in the second .
well , here i am , anonymous , with guys nobody really cares about .
most come from the end of the line , small towns you never heard of .
pulaski , tennessee .
brandon , mississippi .
pork bend , utah .
wampum , pennsylvania .
two years ' high school' s about it .
if they' re lucky , a job waiting for them back in a factory .
most have got nothing .
they' re poor .
they' re the unwanted .
yet they' re fighting for our society and our freedom .
it' s weird , isn' t it ?
at the bottom of the barrel , and they know it .
maybe that' s why they' re called " grunts " , cos a grunt can take it , can take anything .
they' re the best i' ve ever seen , grandma .
the heart and soul .
taylor ...
cheese dick , you' re up .
what ?
you' re up .
sure you know how to work the claymores , dude ?
flick the safety off and bang on that sucker three times .
i got it .
don' t catch any zs on me , buddy , or i' il sling your sorry ass .
you hear me ?
maybe i' ve finally found it way down here in the mud .
maybe from here i can start up again .
be something i can be proud of without having to be a fake human being .
maybe i can see something i don' t yet see , or learn something i don' t yet know .
i miss you .
i miss you very much .

just no fucking way .
get it going now !
new year' s day , 1968 .
just another day .
staying alive .
there' s been a lot of movement near the cambodian border .
a lot of little firefights , ambushes .
we drop bombs , then we walk through the jungle like ghosts in a landscape .
bunker .

bravo six , bravo two .

let' s move !
hey , where' s manny ?
yo , washington !
manny , where you at ?
we had to get to the village before dark , so we left elias with some men to keep looking .
but it was king who found him , about a thousand yards downriver , not far from the village .
it was the end of the mystery .
the motherfuckers !
the village which had stood for maybe 1, 000 years didn' t know we were coming that day .
if they had , they would' ve run .
barnes was at the eye of our rage and , through him , our captain ahab .
he would set things right again .
that day we loved him .
there he goes , sarge !
check him out .
yeah , you got it , sarge .

get out of here , tubbs .
where' d he get these wounds ?
says he was hit in a bombing raid .
he' s a dink for sure !
ask him why these weapons were here .
they had no choice .
the nva killed the old honcho when he said no .
all the rice is theirs .
bullshit , lerner !
who the hell was the gook we nailed on the riverbank ?
he doesn' t know .
he says nva ain' t been around in a couple of months .
maybe it was a scout or something .
yeah , sure , a scout !
what about the fucking rice and the weapons ?
who are they for ?
that cocksucker knows what i' m saying .
goddamn right he does !
he' s lying through his teeth !

where the hell' s the vc ?
he swears he doesn' t know anything .
he hates the nva , but ...

taylor , she' s a fucking dink !
she' s a fucking human being , man !
fuck you !
you' re a fucking cherry , taylor !
fucking animal !
all of you , you' re fucking animals !
fucking lame fuck !
you don' t belong in nam , man !
ain' t your place at all !
you don' t fucking get it , do you , man ?
you just don' t fucking get it .
it' s ok .
get outta there !
police up your dicks and let' s get outta here .
i didn' t see anything , sir .
i did .
that dink was reported to me as nva .
my report will include lieutenant wolfe as being witness to the shooting .
all right , elias .
staff sergeant barnes .
i want a full report on this when we get back to the cp .
you got it , and i can throw in plenty of eyewitnesses if you want , sir .
not now , goddamn it , not now !
we' il get into this when we get to camp .
if i find out there was an illegal killing , there will be a court martial .
right now i need every man in the field .
and you two will cease fire .
staff sergeant barnes , sergeant elias ...
you hear me ?
we' re back in that nva bunker complex tomorrow .
this time from the east .
you people get some rest and be back here at the cp at 1900 for a briefing .
come on , man .
you think these chucks give a fuck about us ?
it could just as well have been you , harold , if you got in barnes ' way .
and that bunny ?
that motherfucker' s crazy !
i mean , he scares me , man .
he just scares me .
you bloods are getting too hung up on all this shit .
these gooks are smarter than you think .
barnes knows his shit , man .
they was nva , every last one of ' em .
he' s taken us this far , right ?
he' il take us the rest of the way .
a christian don' t go around a village cutting off heads and shit .
this shit is really getting outta hand , man .
you don' t seem to know the difference , the way you shoot up that shit all the time .
i don' t know , brothers , but i' m hurting real bad inside .
don' t worry about it .
elias won' t be able to prove a thing .
he' s a troublemaker .
elias is a water walker .
like them politicians trying to fight this war with one hand tied around their balls .
ain' t no need or time for a courtroom out here .
sarge .
thanks , bun .
how' d it go there , bob ?
yeah , that away , sarge .
fucking elias , man .
he' s a fucking rat , that' s what he is .
he' s gonna get everybody in deep shit .
somebody oughta frag his ass .
so whaddaya think , bob ?
gonna be an investigation or what ?
o' neill , man , you worry too much .
sarge' il take care of it .
it' s a beautiful night .
yeah .
i love this place at night .
the stars ...
there' s no right or wrong in ' em .
they' re just there .
that' s a nice way of putting it .
barnes has got it in for you , doesn' t he ?
barnes believes in what he' s doing .
and you ?
do you believe ?
in ' 65 ... yeah .
now ... no .
what happened today is just the beginning .
we' re gonna lose this war .
come on !
you really think so ?
us ?
we' ve been kicking other people' s asses for so long , it' s time we got ours kicked .
day by day , i struggle to maintain not only my strength , but my sanity .
it' s all a blur .
i have no energy to write .
i don' t know what' s right and what' s wrong any more .
the morale of the men is low .
there' s civil war in the platoon .
half the men with elias , half with barnes .
there' s a lot of suspicion and hate .
i can' t believe we' re fighting each other when we should be fighting them .
counting days , and the six inches in front of my face .
not much else .
hope things are well , grandma .
tell mom and dad i ...
well ... just tell them .
chris .
hey , big boy , i know you thought you had that laundry gig all laid out .

they sent us back into the valley the next day , about 2000 meters from cambodia , into a battalion perimeter .
it felt like we were returning to the scene of a crime .
alpha company had been hit hard by a sizeable force and charlie company had been probed that night .
there were other battalions in the valley , but we knew we were gonna be the bait to lure them out .
somewhere out there was the entire 141st nva regiment .
caught those motherfuckers trying to pull some shit on charlie company .
they found maps on ' em , man .
a friend at battalion says they had every fucking foxhole fixed on it .
distances ... tree lines ... our claymores ...
everything .
this is bad , man .

i also heard we' re in fucking cambodia now .
cambodia ?

looks like you got elias' s squad now .
i didn' t know we were still referring to this platoon in terms of squads .
take those two holes there and there .
you' re tying it off with barnes up here , king down there .

i didn' t ask for this job .
i don' t wanna hear it .

how many days are you short ?
nah , it' s not just me .
it' s the way the whole thing works .
people like elias get wasted .
people like barnes go on making up the rules any way they want .
so what do we do ?
sit in the middle and suck on it .
we just don' t add up to dry shit , king .

we gonna get high , high !
sergeant o' neill !
how are you doing ?
just fine , sir .
that' s good , cos you got second platoon .
yes , sir .
ready ?
you bet .
i think now , looking back , we did not fight the enemy , we fought ourselves , and the enemy ... was in us .
the war is over for me now , but it will always be there , for the rest of my days , as i' m sure elias will be , fighting with barnes for what rhah called possession of my soul .
there are times since
i' ve felt like the child born of those two fathers .
but be that as it may , those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again , to teach to others what we know , and to try with what' s left of our lives to find a goodness , and meaning , to this life .
