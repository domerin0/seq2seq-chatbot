how have you been looking out for me ?
are you insane ?

i' ve been trying to help you from the minute we left .
lot of good that' s done .
where are you going ?
i' m not finished .
yeah , well , i am .
why don' t you run along and have fun .
that' s what you' re good at .
as opposed to you , which is walking away whenever we have a real conversation ?
i don' t have time for a real conversation .
i' m too busy taking care of things .
so who asked you to ?
you did .
the minute you stopped taking responsibility for anything since mom died .
that doesn' t mean you get to be her replacement .
you know what i miss most about mom ?
is that she loved that we were different .
and you punish me for it .
from the day mom died ... ... you' ve done nothing but push me out of your life .
i have not .
oh , come on , jane .
the biggest day of your academic career , and you didn' t even bother to invite me .
well , forgive me for wanting the day to be about me for a change .
i make honor roll , dad doesn' t notice because you' re in detention .
i' m captain of the cheerleading squad , and dad can' t come to one game .
one game , because he' s busy going to your parent/ counselor meetings .
you wanna know why i want this fellowship abroad ?
it' s because it' s 3000 miles away from you .
well , i really hope you get it , then .
roxy .
don' t you worry .
i' m not going to let the mean little man hurt you .
hey , i don' t know who you are or what your game is ... ... but you' ve caused me a great deal of inconvenience today .

i just got in a huge fight with my sister .
she was gonna give a speech today .

mother .

i' m honorary chair of the mcgill fellowship .
what are you doing here ?
i wanted to see you present the award .

it' s okay .
oh , my god .
you may proceed ... ... miss ryan .
please .
right .
oh , man .
well ... ... as many of you all know ... ... the economy is ... ... very , very important to all of us .
take the word " economy .
you have " eco , " which stands for environment .
you know , which we' re all real big supporters of .
and we have " onomy , " which ... ... is pig latin for " money .
money , economy .
right .
go , go , go .
good luck .
okay .
are you coming ?
come on .
yeah .
why' d you have to go and make things so complicated ?
i see the way you' re acting , like you' re somebody else , gets me frustrated .
you fall , and you crawl ... ... and you break , and you take what you can get .
you turn it into honesty ... ... and promise me i' m never gonna find you fake it .
no .
no .
no .
oh , thank god .
roxy ?
well , ladies and gentlemen , that' s all the time i have for ...
so ... ... will the real jane ryan please stand up ?
reinaldo !
trey , what is going on ?

what are you doing here ?
well , aside from completely humiliating myself ...
i' m sorry .
i wanted to read the speech for you ...
no .
please .
here .
i can take it from here .
are you sure ?
ladies and gentlemen , my name is jane ryan .
roxy , behind you !
nassau county department of truancy .
this girl , roxanne ryan , is now in my custody .
and that girl , jane ryan , is an accomplice in her criminal activities !
and she stole my stupid ugly mutt too .
i don' t know what is going on here , but that " mutt " is mine .
come here , ugly doggy .
and i order you to give him back .
yeah , you and what army , lady ?
officer !
me ?
arrest that man !
yes , ma' am .
oh , my baby .
fly .
every time .
hey , that' s my mom' s dog !
i think it started .
it doesn' t look like cats .
everybody , freeze .
someone please explain to me what is going on .
i think i can do that .
see , this guy over here ... ... that man who thinks he' s chinese ...
you' re not .
and his mother are criminals dealing in pirated music , movies ... ... and probably gucci handbags .
i don' t know .
probably .
the guy with the eyebrows .
we know him .
he drove us over here .
he didn' t tell us he was in the play .
a cop and an actor .
and how , may i ask , did you two get involved in this ?
i think i can shed some light on that .
you see ... ... senator , it was this crime fighter here , officer lomax ... ... who tracked down the bang family and wouldn' t rest until justice was served .
so really , we' re just witnesses to his sting operation .
yeah !
what she said .
is that true , officer lomax ?
did you engineer this collar ?
well , i don' t want to gloat , senator , but i think " mastermind " ... ... might be a more appropriate choice of words .
i love you .
just a second .
i assume that wasn' t the speech you intended to give this afternoon .
not exactly , but ...
no .
no .
it wasn' t .
but you should have heard the real one .
it was amazing , and i know this , because i heard her practice it 1000 times .
and trust me , she would have won this thing hands down .
i' m sorry today didn' t work out the way you planned .
see , i thought today was about the speech , the fellowship ... ... my academic future .
but instead , it was about something much more important .
it just took me a few wrong turns to see it .
that was something else , wasn' t it ?
honey , i loved it .
i loved it !
yes .
you gotta ...
come on .
gotta give it up for the cats !
who let the cats out ?
get your hands where i can see them .
who let the cats out ?
you' re not even a real cop .
zip it , odd job .
thanks to you , that' s all gonna change .
let me do it .
so you' re not mad ?
are you kidding ?
i can' t believe what you did for me today .
listen ...
i want to apologize ... ... for saying the things i said earlier .
it' s just ... ... i was having a meltdown .
everything was going wrong .
that' s because every time i tried to fix it , it got worse .
the point is ... ... we haven' t spent the day together in a really long time ... ... and i' ve really missed you .
i' ve missed you too .
and i' m so , so sorry if i ever made you feel ... ... like you had to take mom' s place .
she would have been really proud .
both of us .
it was really great bumping into you today .
maybe we could bump again .
did i just say that ?
yeah .
yeah .
and i' m glad you did .
so how about you just give me a call ?
okay .
yeah .
jane ryan ?
bye .
bye .
allow me to introduce myself .
my name is hudson mcgill .
listen , i am so sorry about everything that happened today ...
you know what ?
i think you handled yourself really well today , considering everything .
the mcgill foundation would be really honored ... ... if you would represent us at oxford university next year .
but ...
i don' t understand .
i found these .
this would have been an amazing speech .
it' s not just that you wanted to win ... ... it' s that you absolutely refused to fail .
and you didn' t .
you deserve this fellowship , jane .
you really do .
congratulations and good luck .
thank you .
can you believe it ?
i' m so happy .
i don' t ...
thank you .
no , thank you .
one , two , three , four !
hey .
hi .

yeah .
yeah , i' m not gonna be able to visit you .

i mean , your whole life' s here .
i get it .
jane , i' m playing .
i' m moving .
i' m actually transferring schools there next year .
really ?
seriously ?
are you excited ?
yeah .
i' ve got this great idea for the video .
it' s , like , roxy , and she' s dressed as a cucumber , and ...

agreed .

sorry to break up the party here , kids .
but you see , i got this little vw bug parked out there in a loading zone .
license number 2 quilted laxative 4 santa kansas limerick .
where' s roxanne ryan ?
you' ve got to be kidding me .
i am .
i just stopped by to wish you bon voyage ... ... and maybe get an autograph .
of course you may , officer lomax .
thank you , ma' am .
hey , lggy pop , crank the juice on that half stack , and let' s hear what this band can do !
