i' m a transfer student .
bates .
right .
welcome to prestridge .
you have a condition of some sort .
i' ve caught a cough .
well , you heard what they said .
you' re in a one room double .
a moment of silence for his roommate .
isn' t there someone else i can talk to ?
can i talk to your supervisor ?
follow me .
excuse me .
excused .
you' re evil , cass .
took you how long to figure this out ?
we met in this very line last year .
this year they let me reserve a room .
daddy bought a wing .
miss merteuil , your suite is ready .
wonderful .
how was your summer ?
short .
see you tonight .
need to get a driver .
hi .
patrick , right ?
i saw you checking out that girl in line .
what do you mean ?
cassidy merteuil .
forget her .
she' s a black widow .
comes from a long line of black widows .
you wouldn' t last five minutes .
let me guess , you' ve never lasted five minutes .
i' m kidding , man .
just leave cassidy to me , all right ?
if you' re gonna cough , can you take that outside ?
i' m sorry , i can' t help it , but i shouldn' t bother you at night ... ... because i have sleeping pills .
that' s a relief .
how do i look ?
seriously .
not as good as ...
christopher " limey " ?
i prefer " englishman .
he descended from the house of lancaster .
yeah , so did his teeth .
why fuck with guys like him when you could be fucking with guys like me ?
because guys like you don' t dine with the queen .
dream on .
i' m sure he prefers a real princess .
we' il see .
you know , you' re just like your cousin .
she ruins the family name ... ... forces you to california to flee her rep , and yet ... ... she' s still your role model .
if you want to be kathryn that badly , at least let me be your sebastian .
kathryn .
sebastian .
where are they now ?
oh , yeah , methadone clinic and dead .
we can do better .
you' re no challenge whatsoever .
not to mention a little deficient when it comes to ...
what ?
the sexiest organ of all .
you know , the bigger the better .
the brain .
this school .
if you don' t look good , we don' t look good .
we ?
a girl can hope .
yeah .
excuse us .
sorry .
jesus christ , people ... ... pop a prozac or three .
summer' s finished .
get over it .
saint tropez .
hunting in scotland .
summer session at la sorbonne .
miami beach .
miami beach ?
new money .
none of those are any more of a playground than our santa barbara .
i speak for myself and my girlfriend ... ... when i say we never came here to play .
except for maybe with each other .
didn' t cassidy turn you on to this place ?
she must have warned you about guys like me .
by name , actually .
so michael and sheila have come for the right reasons .
how about you , alison ?
i came for the education .
seriously .
christopher ?
this is america .
you hear the rumors , but i am here in spite of them .
patrick .
now , here is a guy that came to play .
patrick ?
sorry ?
think he' il make the cover of the prestridge catalog ?
now , that' s the cassie i know .
right .
well , i should probably be off .
you' il be around later ?
perhaps .
i' il hunt you down .
i have something to show you .
oh , my gosh , let' s see .
so christopher has taken an interest in me .
so christopher has taken an interest in me .
he should take an interest in flossing .
quit it .
he' s royalty .
my father always stressed the value of good foreign relations .
i' m surprised it' s taken you this long .
i' m playing it cool .
i want to meet an entire new society .
i wonder , is it possible ?
what ?
that you' ve overestimated yourself .
right .
i' il bet you $5000 ... ... you can' t sleep with christopher by the end of this weekend .
five thousand dollars wouldn' t even cover a weekend at the spa .
fine .
ten thousand dollars .
done .
doesn' t seem fair , though .
why ?
i would have bet on someone easier than christopher .
really ?
i' m not so sure that you could even sleep with someone like patrick ... ... by the end of this weekend .
patrick .
i could have patrick in an hour , freak .
another $ 10, 000 says that you can' t .
and because i' m a gentleman ... ... gonna give you 48 hours instead of one .
forty eight .
it' s enough time to get rid of that not so fresh feeling .
nice .
i' il need some physical proof .
so let' s see , that gives me 47 hours ... ... for my disgust for you ... ... to overcome my disgust for patrick .
have a nice time .
here , try another one .
let' s see .
all right .
alison , never forget the key to a cultured man' s heart .
golf .
golf and blowjobs .
jason .
and you' ve been working on your etiquette .
i want a kiss .
no .
meaning no .
one ?
finished ?
yeah .
good .
now , never touch me again .
ever .
friends ?
women .
is this taken ?
no .
it' s beautiful out .
yeah .
patrick , can i be honest ?
sure .
you interest me .
i' m sorry ?
you interest me .
i interest you ?
sounds funny even to me , but yeah .
thanks .
you see them ?
i didn' t think there' d come a time when guys like that didn' t interest me .
but i was wrong .
lately ... ... l' ve been thinking about guys like you .
can i show you something ?
sure .
sure .
nice room .
thanks .
you' re gonna be surprised ... ... but i' ve been writing .
what is it ?
a short story .
you' re the first person i' ve shown it to .
you' re an english major , so i respect your opinion .
would you look at it ?
you want my feedback ?
i' m gonna go read it .
i' il be right here .
how can you be so insecure ?
how can you be so insecure ?
i love it .
i' m blown away .
the writing and the dialogue ...
oh , i' m so excited .
i' il get it .
cassidy .
please .
i don' t understand .
what is it ?
nothing , patrick .
what is it ?
oh , jesus , you turn me on .
oh , my god .
what ?
what ?
what is it ?
nothing , patrick .
oh , god .
jesus , you turn me ...
ten thousand dollars .
you could' ve faked that .
the orgasm ?
of course .
no , the tape .
please .
sad , you could' ve used this to make a little life for yourself .
you know you' re only halfway home .
christopher' s coming over later .
i' il be home by midnight .
i' il be in touch .
so the key to a good polo pony is one that is small and agile .
fifteen hands is quite perfect .
really ?
that' s ... ... fascinating .
yeah .
the ponies i had at eton were between 15 and 16 hands ... ... and we never lost a match .
eton ?
so you know prince william .
yeah , wills was in my house with me .
he' s an excellent player , you know .
do you know him ?
we' ve only met a few times , mostly at charity functions .
you know , i think his grandmama makes him go to those .
yes , we both love to give money away .
i' m so glad you' re here , christopher .
i' m not used to young ladies being quite so forward .
i' m not complaining .
i' m sure it' s no one .
so are you liking the states ?
excuse me .
hi .
i brought you some ...
what' s going on ?
excuse me ?
what does it look like ?
a date .
forgive me ...
patrick , is it ?
what ?
i barely know you .
what are you doing in my room ?
what' s wrong with you ?
what' s wrong with me ?
i have spoken two words to you in my entire life .
what ?
this must be some sort of mistake , christopher .
yes , evidently .
cassidy .
i' d like you to leave .
christopher , i don' t know why you' re here ... ... or what cassidy has told you ... ... but cassidy and i just made love a few hours ago .
well , i should probably go .
no .
not until you' ve had a chance to judge her for yourself .
to judge her ?
look ... ... it' s cassidy' s purse .
you' ve seen her wearing it .
open it and look for a tape recorder and cassidy' s wallet .
i' m not going to investigate her .
what do you know ?
i think christopher will be interested in this .
good god !
look , it' s the $ 10, 000 that cassidy took to do what you just heard .
this is extraordinary .
christopher , i can explain .
not the time .
so how does it feel to be used ?
you know better than anyone .
so we' re even .
well , we' re even all right .
gosh , you' re a disgusting little shit .
well , well , well .
what' s wrong with you ?
look at you with your tight ass and your perfect little tits .
you still don' t get it , do you ?
get what ?
you wouldn' t give a guy like me the fucking time of day .
but you sure gave it to me this afternoon .
jason told you to do this .
no , jason didn' t tell me to do this .
i told jason to do this .
what ?
it looks like you lost your bet on christopher .
he sure isn' t sleeping with you now , but you know what ?
don' t give jason the money , give it to me .
it wasn' t jason' s money to begin with , it was mine .
okay , i' il slow down .
i arranged the whole thing .
the nerd act , the challenge , the two bets .
the bet on me gave me the chance to bang you .
the bet on christopher gave me the chance to win $ 10, 000 back .
all i needed was a partner .
someone who knows what it' s like to feel rejected .
hey , toots .
you fuckers .
honestly , from experience , i' m not sure you' re worth $ 10, 000 ... ... but you' re a hell of a freebie .
i should' ve known you couldn' t afford that .
so , what did you get out of this ?
one look at the expression on your face .
you believe i found someone as awful as you ?
i mean , come on ... ... what are the chances ?
oh , by the way , your story ... ... it sucked .
you know , it occurred to me , we go to a school where they actually play polo .
fucking sick .
do you think we hurt her ?
who' s ever had sex where someone didn' t get hurt ?
you' re bitter .
i remember lots of times when no one got hurt .
sex is about hurting people .
where' d you get the nerd act ?
well , i spent a long time trying to hide the homely .
and then i realized , don' t conceal it , play it up .
don' t make it better , make it worse .
they never see me coming .
yeah , well ... ... l' m too proud to play a nerd .
well , you' ve seen the last of the nerd .
so , what' s next ?
we' il see .
i want to take you home .
i said , i want to take you home .
i like a guy with goals .
michael , we came to look at the art .
i am looking at art .
there' s something about art .
i find it ... ... inspirational ... ... erotic ...
baby .
hey , alison , want a drink ?
i have a fianc back home .
one drink is hardly an infidelity .
i' m a gentleman .
i don' t know .
come on , the bartender makes a killer martini .
all right .
okay , what do you want , vodka or gin ?
vodka or gin ?
oh , vodka .
two vodka martinis , please .
cheers .
cheers .
do you have a favorite painting ?
i like this one over here .
yeah ?
has a little bit of a basquiat feeling .
yeah , yeah .
you look really pretty .
you know , i should really get back to my friend , but thank you so much .
okay .
he' s kind of cute .
you know , i' m kind of engaged .
but what about you ?
there , you took me home .
talk soon .
20 16 .
soccer service .
game !
you' re dead .
oh , what ?
what ?
what ?
what ?
sorry .
next game , you' re mine .
bring it on .
lf i didn' t know better ...
alison ?
never .
good .
she' s engaged , since the age of 2 ... ... at least in the eyes of her family and his .
it' s part of a larger merger .
old money .
i have a question .
does sex always satisfy you ?
what do you mean ?
i can' t remember the last time i was satisfied by sex .
is something wrong ?
you bored ?
i guess so .
nothing' s wrong .
i get bored by sex too , if i don' t use it .
as what ?
a weapon .
sick motherfucker .
how you feeling ?
strangely attracted to you .
bad boys and all .
nice .
i learned my lesson , but you' re done fucking with me .
i told you i loved her .
you two are plotting something .
what about it ?
i came to tell you it' s pathetic .
why ?
if you had me , you could have anyone .
where' s the challenge ?
you' re forgetting i haven' t had you yet .
no , you' re giving us too much credit .
there' s no limit to what two people can do .
you taught me that .
but it' s too easy .
so why don' t you quit cooperating and start competing ... ... for some eligible bachelorettes .
it' s only fair .
after all , i can' t stand to see you two look bored .
she' s right , you know .
i have had my eye on her .
cassidy ?
i do love her , but no .
sheila .
she' s devoted to ...
michael .
i hadn' t noticed .
someone that sexy has no right to be faithful to such an idiot .
or to anyone .
i don' t know if i' d pick sheila , though .
why not ?
i like alison .
you said you' d leave ...
until you' re married , you' re not married .
besides , alison' s perfect .
virtuous and loyal .
she' d gasp at all the right moments .
fine .
i steal sheila from michael , you steal alison from her fianc .
first one to cross home plate wins our dorm room .
the loser ?
fends for himself .
i could use some privacy .
i' m gonna get started .
happy hunting .
i got next .
you got next ?
this is some fundraiser you helped organize .
thanks .
i think the pier' s preservation is really important .
oh , sorry .
i got it .
i' m a total klutz .
that' s okay .
here .
i saw that .
what ?
patrick .
it' s nothing .
it' s sweet .
my parents have always been really supportive of me .
we have a great relationship .
i had trouble getting my folks to pay attention .
so are you ready to watch the master at work ?
what was that ?
nothing .
let' s go for a walk .
hey , what' s up ?
how you doing ?
you gonna be at the game on saturday ?
yeah , of course .
see you there , buddy .
take care .
yeah .
yeah , i agree .
he' s a great guy .
awesome polo player .
okay , what' s wrong ?
oh , just thinking of david .
what ?
there' s nothing wrong with missing sex .
alison , it' s completely natural .
okay , i do miss sex , but that' s not the point .
you know , i miss david .
we' ve known each other since preschool .
how romantic .
the blankets , the blocks , the cookies and milk .
you know what i mean .
it' s just sometimes you sound more like brother and sister .
yeah , well , we care about each other very much .
i know .
these shots are of the altarpiece ... ... from mission san carlos borromo de carmelo .
look at the detail .
absolutely exquisite .
well , that' s it for today .
the department field trip to carmel is a go for this weekend .
i checked the sign up sheet .
we' ve full capacity .
those of you attending will receive extra credit upon your return .
i' il have somebody take my place .
i' m sorry , professor eldridge ... ... the carmel trip is full ?
yes .
i was wondering if you' d make an exception .
i normally wouldn' t ask , but i started my paper on junpero serra ... ... and i was wondering ...
jason ... ... you should' ve thought about this earlier .
take it up with someone else on the list .
yeah , i know ...
lf there are any cancellations ... ... l' il let you know .
yeah .
weak .
really ?
sheila and michael are such a cute couple ... ... and you , trying to come between them .
you' re just jealous .
jealous ?
sheila' s going to love my big , bulging brain .
let' s see it then .
fucking hate california .
jason , what is it ?
what' s wrong ?
i was supposed to go visit my grandmother near carmel ... ... but i missed the sign up for eldridge' s trip .
why don' t you fly ?
kind of on a tight budget .
mamaw , she just had both hips replaced .
she could use some cheering up , but eldridge is being a hard ass .
sheila and i signed up for that trip .
yeah ?
yeah , she' s dragging me .
says i could use a little culture .
a little culture never killed anyone .
hey , would you guys be willing to visit her for me ?
i have some things you could give her .
sure , yeah , but i got a better idea .
why don' t you just take my place on the trip ?
michael , you and sheila planned this .
really , we' re mature enough to spend a weekend apart .
you sure ?
you' ve been looking forward to this trip .
i was only going to carmel to be with you .
why don' t we give jason a chance to see his grandmother ?
wow , i' m speechless , but i wouldn' t even consider it ... ... unless it' s okay with sheila .
sure .
you guys are saints , really .
i mean , i can just see her face now .
it' s the least we can do .
thanks , you guys .
careful i don' t try and steal her .
yeah .
come on , we' il go tell eldridge .
mamaw " ?
you never wanted to fuck me more than right now .
it' il pass .
come in .
what' s wrong ?
alison ... ... i love you .
what ?
i love you .
please say something .
i can' t believe you just said that .
i' m sorry .
i can' t help it .
i don' t know what to say .
david , your fianc , are you in love with him ?
we' re engaged .
but are you in love with him ?
because if you aren' t ...
i can' t talk to you when you' re like this .
no , not until you can talk to me rationally .
i am rational , i promise ... ... so let me say my piece .
please ?
i love you .
and i think you might love me .
i' d never ask you to compromise your relationship for a one night stand .
don' t mistake any of the feelings that i' ve shown you for love .
we' re friends .
just because the person i love ... ... isn' t here now doesn' t mean you can take advantage .
you' re not in love with david .
stop it .
don' t tell me who i' m in love with .
but you' re spending four years apart .
if you' re in love , you' d never do that .
just because you can' t imagine a relationship ... ... that' s based on maturity and trust ...
maturity and trust ?
you sound like a bank .
if you felt any love for david , any passion , you wouldn' t be here .
you' re wrong .
i' m right .
i want you to go .
alison ...
go !
how' s it going ?
right on schedule .
yeah ?
well , i' m ahead of schedule .
where are you going ?
carmel .
with michael and sheila ?
nope .
just sheila .
what ?
you look surprised .
no .
look , is it really that crazy that i' m better at this than you are ?
no , he just said , " i love you " out of nowhere .
god , what was he thinking ?
i know .
you' re practically married .
it' s so important to our family and the two businesses .
it' s like a legacy .
i mean , david and i have been meant for each other since ... ... forever .
you sound disappointed by that .
when i first brought up going to school out here to david ... ... you know what he said ?
go .
and i wanted him to say that , but then when he did , i just ...
i got this weird feeling , and i found myself wishing that he' d said ...
no .
it' s awful , isn' t it ?
i mean , he' s so great about it ... ... but i just found myself wishing that he' d be protective ... ... love me too much to let me go .
and he didn' t ... ... and it made me wonder .
now i don' t know .
what about patrick ?
patrick ?
i care about patrick , i' m just ...
i' m not attracted to him .
i understand .
even if i were , it' s just like ...
it' s like i' m waiting for something or someone .
it all sounds terrible , doesn' t it ?
no , not at all .
one sec .
i probably shouldn' t tell you this , but you' re closer than you think .
excuse me ?
that fianc of alison' s isn' t a lock .
really ?
don' t lube up yet .
she wants to trade up , not down .
maybe if you looked more like ... ... brent .
let' s see , what were her exact words ?
oh , yeah .
patrick ?
i care about him ... ... l' m just ...
i' m just not attracted to him .
what , doesn' t seem fair ?
life' s not fair .
hi .
i came to say i' m sorry .
it wasn' t until now that i realized what your friendship means to me , and ...
what' s that ?
the world .
i respect your relationship with david .
i do .
if all i can have is your friendship , that' s fine .
just please don' t shut me out .
so you' re okay with just being friends ?
best friends .
good night .
thanks , patrick .
okay .
bye .
i better go .
i' il miss you .
have fun .
i love you .
take pictures .
i' il call you tonight .
cool .
i' il keep a close eye on him .
you stopped kissing first .
i can' t believe she told you about us .
yeah .
i can' t make her love me if she doesn' t .
it isn' t you , patrick .
you' re right .
god , if she only knew how many guys her fianc scared off .
really ?
yeah .
how many ?
who ?
come on , tell me .
well ...
brent patterson ?
brent , and josh sloane ...
wait , i thought brent patterson had a crush on cassidy .
he' s tired of her leading him on , or so i heard .
what' s your brent patterson fantasy ?
cop .
personal trainer .
you know , he has a little fantasy about you .
all right ...
come on , you said ...
no .
i know what i said , but no .
no .
native americans helped to complete ... ... the construction of the carmel mission in 1771 .
this is the stone that commemorates the life of the founder of this mission .
okay , everybody , let' s move on .
take this .
come with me .
yeah , it' s ...
it' s definitely beautiful .
never thought i' d be cold in california .
thanks .
yeah .
is that better ?
yeah .
i ...
i gotta go .
where ?
my grandmother' s , remember ?
right .
right , okay .
i' il be back .
we have to talk .
what do you mean we have to talk ?
this isn' t working out .
i' m sick of feeling like your boy toy .
fine .
i wouldn' t have slept with you anyway .
seriously ?
seriously .
go blow dry your hair or lift heavy stuff or whatever it is guys like you do .
yeah , i know .
okay .
cheers , mate .
hello .
hey .
brent .
alison .
i was just leaving .
you mind ?
no .
hi .
she' s a tough old gal .
she gave me this ... ... for good luck .
i' m glad you came .
me too .
are you a risk taker ?
it depends ... ... on the risk .
how about a coin toss ?
it' s the simplest of risks .
heads , tails , win or lose .
first , for this dollar here .
heads or tails ?
heads .
heads .
it' s yours .
now for the relationship .
what ?
our relationship .
we flip to see what it is .
i mean , you' re confused , right ?
so am i. are we buddy buddy or ...
i got it ... ... master slave .
quit it .
whoever wins the flip decides who' s master ... ... and who' s slave , just for the night .
slave is slave , and master' s master .
so , what' s this all about ?
what do you mean ?
dinner , flowers ... ... it' s all just a little ... ... sudden .
look at all the stars tonight .
you know , they say that you can see the crab nebula .
wow , look ...

no , i don' t .

david doesn' t have to know .

brent .
did you keep something to remember him by ?
you know ?
open it .
i don' t understand .
you will .
these are ...
a little out of focus .
i' m not really much of a photographer , but i' d say they turned out okay .
how did you ...
quiet .
what are you doing ?
patrick !
i said , quiet .
now , you listen to me , and you listen good .
somewhere , there' s an envelope addressed to david crestwood ... ... at 7348 ram place , newport , rhode island .
in that envelope are more pictures , so if you don' t keep your mouth shut ... ... that envelope' s gonna find a mailbox .
you understand me ?
do you understand ?
yes .
good , because if you don' t ... ... your fianc won' t be the only one who sees these .
i' ve got some for his family , for your family ...
oh , stop crying .
they' re not gonna go anywhere if you just show me the respect i deserve .
i ...
how ?
how ?
put brent up to it ?
i paid him 500 bucks to forget about cassidy and sleep with you .
don' t tell anyone .
he asked for 1000 , can you believe that ?
he must have student loans to pay off .
either that , or you just aren' t his type .
oh , you are sick !
who' s sick ?
i cared for you , and you rejected me for david crestwood ... ... who you just betrayed for a fucking piece of ass .
david was good enough for you , brent was good enough for you ... ... and now i' m good enough for you .
patrick , please don' t do this .
please .
yeah , of course i called her back , but there' s no fucking answer .
shit !
maybe i' m wrong , but it sounded like they were ...
i mean , am i crazy ?
i could see it between them .
you don' t know jason .
he can' t control himself .
oh , i am gonna kill him .
you do , and the whole campus will hear the story .
what am i supposed to do ?
well , there is one thing .
thank you .
it' s been my pleasure .
so where' s michael ?
off , thinking of me .
why , is something wrong ?
i mean , other than with mamaw' s hips .
you' ve been meddling .
why does it matter to you what i do with michael ?
you' re jealous .
you are .
you said you didn' t want to fuck me .
i never said i didn' t want to fuck you .
admit it , you care about me .
all this and brains too ?
i think it' s you who' s jealous .
you might be right .
jason , i can' t believe you don' t want to see the pictures .
not interested .
so it' s a tie .
we' re still roommates .
i didn' t know you had it in you .
yeah ?
how' s alison ?
after this , they either gain or lose weight .
guessing she' il lose weight .
what ?
she needs to drop the freshman 15 .
what you did was wrong .
what about you and sheila ?
we both had a good time .
what did alison ever do to you ?
you have no fucking idea .
i' m out .
too late .
this is weird .
what is ?
well , patrick and i don' t have anything going on , and i' m not bored .
how do you feel ?
happy .
me too .
one truth ?
one ?
after you saw me mind fuck michael into replacing him on that trip ... ... did you ever fantasize about me ?
maybe .
do you believe in second chances ?
if i died and i got the chance to come back for one day , any day ... ... l' d choose this one .
that is so pathetic .
seriously , that' s your best material ?
it' s not material .
it' s how i feel .
here .
now , does that feel like a guy who' s using material ?
god , cassidy , when i look at you , i can barely put two words together .
then don' t .
slow .
slow works for me .
there' s something i need to tell you .
i' m having dinner with patrick tomorrow .
i' m sorry ?
we set it up a while back .
he insisted .
i have to get rid of him .
yes , well , you try and keep your food down .
this better be good .
do you ever wonder why we are the way we are ?
what do you mean ?
morally out there ?
i' m not quite so far out there , but i was born with certain qualities .
i wanted to take advantage of them .
i was born without those qualities .
when people met me ... ... they were unimpressed , so i had to impress myself on them .
i admire you , cassidy , and i want you .
i already gave you that .
if i had satisfied you , then you would' ve been suspicious .
but let me satisfy you now .
tie you to the bedpost .
i' m a master at two things : causing girls pain and pleasure .
i' ve already caused you pain .
that leaves one thing .
you and i are alike .
sleeping with you now would just seem incestuous .
we didn' t even make it past sake .
tell me .
patrick said something about how we' re alike .
no , we' re different from him .
see , we' re fucked up , but he' s ...
well , he' s fucked up .
pay less attention to patrick and more to me .
why so protective ?
because .
because ?
just because .
just because ?
because i care about you .
do i have to spell it out for you ?
if i don' t want you eating with patrick , it' s because , yes ... ... l' m jealous , and i' m worried .
what do you want ?
and that' s not all .
my dad' s talking about expanding his property holdings out west .
yeah ?
i' m thinking about staying in southern california .
we need to talk .
maybe later .
now .
i know a good exterminator .
this will take a second .
what' s up ?
i have a proposition for you .
i told you , i' m out .
you telling me you' re satisfied ?
weren' t alison and sheila enough ?
they were nothing .
fish so small we threw them back ... ... while the big one got away .
the big one ?
there' s only one girl worth competing for now .
first we cooperated and fucked her ... ... then she suggested our competition .
what' s left except competing for cassidy ?
no , i' m not competing for cassidy .
fuck you .
you' re practically in her pants already .
no , we' re taking things slow .
so you' il be pissed if i get up her first ?
this began with cassidy and us , this has to end with cassidy and us .
you two suddenly have feelings .
what are you afraid of ?
not you .
what' s wrong ?
you' re trying to win her anyway .
beat me .
rub my nose in it .
you know you want to .
don' t be a fucking pussy .
what do i win ?
to make it official ?
one dollar .
good luck .
you got my note .
pretty serious stuff .
so let me get this straight , you' re in love with me ?
sucks to be me .
so did you ...
did you change your mind ?
i' ve come to say that i' ve figured you out .
you' ve noticed that jason and i are in love , and you' re trying to break us up .
what ?
you know i don' t fall that easy .
you and jason always had a thing .
but we only just fell in love .
so you only just started caring .
cass , i' ve always cared .
do you care that no one' s ever gonna fall in love with you ?
i don' t know if you can love ... ... but you like hating more anyway .
are you uglier on the outside or on the inside ?
when you' ve been ignored as long as i , we' il see what you do to get noticed .
take it from me , you would rather get fucked than ignored .
i guess so .
you can' t sweep me under the rug ... ... any more than my parents , my school or this fucking world .
you sweep too much under the rug ... ... suddenly the rug' s not big enough to cover it all .
you really love jason .
yes .
and he really loves you ?
yes .
you sound so sure ... ... but love is blind .
it' s too late to change my mind .
i' m meeting jason at 8 .
jason doesn' t love you .
what if i said , not once , but twice now ... ... you' ve been the prize in one of our little contests ?
what if i said jason and i made a bet ... ... to see who could make you forget what we did to you ... ... and fuck with your mind and body all over again ?
did you hear what i said , cassidy ?
jason doesn' t love you .
he just wants to fuck you so he can win the bet .
that' s not true .
you know it is .
jason wouldn' t do that to me .
you know jason .
it was as much your bet as it was his .
yeah , but i' m telling you about it .
do you think jason was going to tell you about it ?
trust the truth .
i want you , cassidy .
i don' t want you under false pretenses .
i want you here and now .
i can' t .
i' ve never met anyone like you ... ... and you' ve never met anyone like me .
i am the only guy on the face of the earth ... ... who' s worthy to be in the same room with you .
for once , i' m telling it like it is .
trust me .
you can tie me down .
for you .
jesus .
what happened ?
you had to choose between me and patrick ... ... and you chose patrick .
if it' s patrick you want ...
jason , jason , jason .
i crossed the finish line a half hour ago .
but don' t feel bad , i' ve never won by less .
how could you ?
i really loved you .
i loved you too .
there' s no such thing .
now i' d like you both to leave me alone .
first i want jason to tell me what it' s like to be a victim .
fuck you .
actually , you' re both my victims .
why ?
because you were in love ... ... and now you' re not .
see what happens ... ... when you underestimate ?
we underestimated the evil in you ?
you underestimated the evil in yourselves .
so you don' t know what it feels like to be a victim ?
no .
i' d love to teach you .
sorry , i' ve got plans .
i' m sorry too .
but once you' ve been convicted of my rape ... ... you won' t be making any plans .
i thought we weren' t going to tell him .
sorry , i just had to see his face .
you know , she' s gonna charge you with sexual assault .
i' m sure the authorities will be sympathetic .
semen samples , fingerprints ... ... wrist abrasions ... ... torn clothes ... ... plus one of your sleeping pills ... ... in my bloodstream .
recognize ?
jason swiped them .
i just took one myself ... ... but the doctor won' t know the difference .
patrick came over to talk ... ... but he must have slipped something into the wine ... ... because i started to feel sleepy .
and then ... ... he locked the door .
and then he grabbed me ... ... and tried to tie me down .
i tried to struggle , but the knots were so tight .
and then ... ... he raped me .
if only i had arrived in time .
i mean , i could' ve helped .
see what happens when you underestimate ?
you took me so lightly .
so i suggested the sheila alison thing ... ... because i knew a competition for them ... ... would lead to a competition for me .
alison was a tough nut until i dangled brent in front of you .
that' s when you got the idea ... ... that maybe brent could go places you couldn' t .
and what do you know ... ... your little game with sheila and alison ended in a photo finish ... ... which led you right back to you know who .
only you weren' t competing for me ... ... you were competing against me .
and this time , jason and i got to each other first .
after what you did to alison , i was happy to help .
so ... ... here' s your dollar .
i' m looking forward to having my own room .
and you' re off to prison ... ... where the sex is never boring .
the police should be out front right about now .
they were called 20 minutes ago .
you' re a fucking bitch !
they will never believe you .
right the first time .
open up .
would you tell me what this is all about , please ?
we' il let you know down at the station .
i' m ...
i' m not sure exactly .
i think he slipped something into my drink .
this is ridiculous .
it' s her word against mine .
she' s lying .
i don' t have to say anything ...
we know . ... but i want to clear my name from the lies of a jilted person .
i think you should know , mr. bates , another victim has come forward .
watch your head , now .
come on guys , back up .
tell me how this ends .
ends ?
you and me .
it' s still kind of soon .
if it means anything , i' m done playing games .
what you did , it wasn' t easy ... ... but i know why you did it .
why ?
because after everything ... ... that we put you through , you finally wanted out .
wrong .
i wanted back in .
see , patrick' s out of the way , prince christopher' s had time to heal ...
ten thousand bucks says i can be down those swim trunks by midnight .
what about us ?
i mean ...
the only problem fucking with someone as twisted as yourself ... ... is you' re fucking with someone as twisted as yourself .
well ?
i knew you' d understand .
did you have a nice swim ?
yes , thank you .
let' s go get a drink .
why the hell not ?
