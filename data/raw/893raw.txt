don' t take one before they' re done .
shit !
relax !
there are only three small ones for each .
you know that .
now you' ve mixed them .
that' s not very bright .
hi , bjarne .
this is beate .
she' s a teacher at tina' s school .
i thought it would only be us .
she just dropped by .
come on over and sit down , bjarne .
bjarne is shy .
i know what that' s like .
so opening your own shop , huh ?
it' s a big challenge .
svend is really bad with problems .
what ?
i am too .
what do you mean ?
when you don' t get attention ...
then what ?
what ?
whatever .
and why shouldn' t it work ?
if holger can succeed , so can we .
he has his deersausage .
you say " sausage " all the time .
what do you have ?
my marinade .
give bjarne a steak .
isn' t it tough to be a butcher ?
isn' t it a mess of blood and stuff ?
no .
it must be exciting too .
how many pigs could you slaughter in one day ?
1, 100 .
1, 100 ?
have you always wanted to be a butcher ?
it must be lonely in that kitchen with all that blood and ...
what are you doing ?
did you just kick me ?
shit !
what the fuck are you doing ?
why did you invite me ?
you need professional help .
i' m not up for that shit .
you don' t have to kick her .
that' s just your version .
... and also two deersausages .
they are absolutely marvelous .
what is your secret , if i may ask ?
it' s a long story .
i' ve always been fascinated by sausages .
it' s almost mythological to kill an animal
and then mock it by sticking it in its own intestine .
can you image anything worse than being stuck up your own ass ?
no , i don' t think so .
that' s one of our small pleasures .
he' s doing it again .
no , no , no ...
look ...
he' s doing it again .
you can' t run a business like that .
i don' t get why people come back .
they want the sausage .
don' t say sausage all the time .
i can make a sausage way better that this bunch of junk .
what did you say , asshole ?
nothing .
delusions of grandeur , huh ?
svend is just talking .
it' s nothing .
you are an embarresment to me .
what do you mean by that ?
i can' t sell bjarne' s pate .
it tastes like jockstrap
and your marinade and meatballs aren' t flying over the counter .
my marinade may need some work , but don' t disparage my meatballs .
they are so fucking tough that you could blow them up like balloons .
let me stand behind the counter .
why should we be hidden away ?
you' il never stand behind the counter , and do you know why ?
because you sweat , and you' re too disgusting .
this isn' t working .
can' t you see it ?
we need to open our own shop .
svend , you have sausage on your head again .
hello again .
hello .
this is my partner bjarne .
hello .
just call me house hans .
you can just ponder why for a moment .
yeees ...
isn' t it because you sell houses ?
yes .
yes ...
bjarne , come on out here and have look .
there you have it .
look here .
here we have a bone crusher .
look at these tiles .
they' re almost intact .
come on .
we just need a bit of beef here , some pig there and some chickens here .
svend , relax .
what do you say ?
it' s fine , but it' s a lot of money .
what do you mean ?
two million is a lot of money .
that' s a strange number to throw around .
he said one million each .
yes , and that makes two million .
i don' t want to discuss that .
i' m planning to mortgage my house all the way .
i don' t have a house .
what am i supposed to do ?
then it just stops here .
what do you want me to do ?
fjeldsted sanatorlum
sanatorlum
if we had known you were coming , we would have cut his hair .
it' s okay .
the resemblance is uncanny .
it is with many twins i think it' s pretty common .
yes , so ...
he' s in here .
you' ve never been here before , have you ?
no .
i haven' t seen him for seven years .
he' il never wake up again , will he ?
no .
he' s completely brain dead .
then turn him off .
why , all of a sudden ?
it' s the best decision .
his organs will benefit others .
but you never answered our letters .
i don' t open all my mail .
i wrote you a letter every month .
really ?
can' t you just turn it off ?
of course .
but may i ask ...
i need money .
he has one million from our parents that i' il get as his only heir .
when he' s just lying there ...
of course .
it' s best for everybody .
fine .
what was he like ?
when you look at someone each day , you wonder what they were like .
no .
it' s crooked again .
are you really unable to see that ?
give me a break .
it looks fine .
fine ?
is fine okay ?
i don' t think so .
let me tell you , you can' t drink 19 beers
and then judge whether something is straight .
it' s nice and straight now , huh ?
it looks fine .
now it' s okay .
secure it properly .
exactly .
just like that .
don' t we need light in here ?
yes , when we find an electrician .
what happened to the one we had ?
i fired him .
he was yakking constantly , and that doesn' t fix the light .
come .
please close the door .
our business cards have arrived .
they' re just right .
with gold print and everything .
just hand them out to people you meet .
who am i going to meet ?
you' il sort it out .
i bought 5, 000 , so just get busy .
hi .
hello .
isn' t it nice ?
i' ve cleaned up a bit .
oh ...
people come on the anniversary .
i noticed that it was seven years ago today .
you don' t come here often ?
no .
it' s my first time .
i thought that they were down there .
is it your parents ?
yes .
and your sister ?
no .
she was my wife .
oh , okay .
was it a car accident ?
how did you know ?
it almost always is when they' ve died on the same day .
i don' t want to disturb you .
i always ask too many questions .
it' s okay .
thank you fortidying up .
you' re welcome .
excuse me .
do you want to open a butcher shop with me ?
what ?
we' re opening a shop tomorrow .
and ...
let me give you a card .
we' ve had these cards made .
oops ...
oh , well ...
i have to give them to people .
do you want to come ?
astrid , are you coming or what ?
we don' t have all day .
no , sorry .
i can' t come .
oh ...
i' ve got two cremations tomorrow .
i know what that' s like .
what was that ?
what did you just do with that meatball ?
if we eat them all , there won' t be any for the customers .
i shouldn' t have to waste half my opening hours telling you that .
and what is that ?
napkins for the customers .
no , it certainly isn' t !
it will ruin the entire presentation .
could you just glance at the color of the counter ?
it' s green , isn' t it ?
and the balloons ?
they' re green .
stop it , svend !
or i' il leave and there won' t be any fucking wedding .
i' m not keeping any people away .
excuse me .
we' ve been playing for two hours .
the drum has a ferry to catch ...
is that so ?
then just get the fuck out of here .
take your fucking music and get lost .
fuck off with your shitty music .
you can' t treat them like that .
oh yes , i can .
you' re an asshole .
relax .
it isn' t svend' s fault that you bought the wrong napkins .
that' s what i' ve been saying , but you don' t listen to me , tina .
i had a point , didn' t i ?
and then you just run out .
i had a point , didn' t i ?
what am i doing wrong ?
i thought i did everything right .
we have offers and decorations .
why don' t we have any customers ?
i have to take a dump .
yes , do that .
it' s damn cold in there .
it' s a meat locker .
i' il just get my coat .
it' s going to take some time .
the wiring is a mess .
taste this marinade .
no .
smell this marinade .
smell this marinade .
it smells good , doesn' t it ?
i smoke 20 joints a day .
i wouldn' t be able to smell it if my hair was on fire .
are you just going to sit there ?
how about doing something productive ?
have you given out your card ?
yes .
yes ?
how many ?
i don' t know .
a few .
go on in , svend .
promise you' il be there tonight .
no , i won' t be .
go on .
it' s absurd to break up now .
i' m on the verge of breaking through to an enormous number of customers .
it' s barbecue season .
it' s no time to break up .
people want steaks and ...
don' t talk about steaks !
why do you say that ?
i haven' t mentioned steaks .
this isn' t about steaks or other meat dishes .
we' re just not right for each other .
you' re just like everybody else .
you don' t like me either .
i lost my parents , when i was very young .
enough with the parents .
i' il make sure to get my stuff out before you come home .
if you really feel like that , then why haven' t you left ?
why are you still sitting here ?
just get out of the car .
don' t count on seeing me tonight .
no .
i' il get out of the car .
but i know you .
you can' t manage without the sweet life .
just sit there and be a martyr .
let' s see you drive off , or is it just empty threats ?
leave , tina .
leave .
holger ...
so this is where you live .
no expense spared , huh ?
i' il just force my way through this swarm of well paying customers .
we' re not open .
bjarne isn' t here yet .
we don' t open until he' s here .
stop it , svend .
so how is business ?
do you have many customers ?
yes , i think so .
great .
then you don' t have to stand there sweating like a pig .
please leave , holger .
i would like that .
it' s my right to be here .
i need to buy something .
no , you don' t .
please leave .
show me what you can do .
the rotary board of directors are coming to dinner at my house .
we' il be 12 plus me .
can you manage that
or is this just mahogany and gleaming tiles ?
svend sweat .
hello ?
what ?
fuck !
shit !
there , there .
let' s pull ourselves together .
yes .
it was an accident .
we' il just have to report it .
this isn' t good .
this isn' t good at all .
listen , we' il just tell it like it is .
it' il be okay .
it' il be okay .
there should be a handle on the inside .
this isn' t good .
where is his leg ?
i don' t know .
listen to me .
why does he have one leg missing ?
it was because holger came .
tina has left me , because she says that i talk too much about steaks .
what have you done ?
i panicked .
holger provoked me .
and what did you do ?
i cut 13 fillets of his thigh and put them in marinade .
rotary were coming for a barbecue .
are you insane ?
are you completely insane ?
i panicked , okay ?
done is done .
can' t we still report it ?
it was an accident .
i didn' t mean to kill him .
you just sold his thigh , dumbass .
you may have killed him by accident , but then you chose to carve him up .
it' s over .
we' re through , svend .
i know .
i shouldn' t have done that last part .
i' m sorry .
what do we do now ?
what do we do with him ?
i don' t know .
throw him in the bone crusher .
nobody knows he was here .
what ?
he did the work off the books .
do you want to use the bone crusher ?
no , i' m trying to help .
you think of something then .
what about holger' s guests ?
what should we tell them ?
okay .
put him in the bone crusher .
let him hang until he' s frozen , otherwise it' il be too disgusting .
i' m glad you came .
they' re crazy .
what' s happening ?
holger had his dinner last night , and now everybody wants more .
they heard about it last night .
about what ?
the fillets .
they love them .
what are you doing now ?
i don' t want to disappoint them , so i' m selling a bit more ofhim .
i' il kill you .
stop it !
it doesn' t matter whether we use the bone crusher or sell him .
it' s the best way to get rid ofhim .
you said it yourself .
i never said that .
let' s say you didn' t .
they want this .
we' re not forcing them .
i don' t have time forthis .
has tina left ?
yes .
why should she stay when i have left her ?
can' t you see that you need help ?
that may be the case .
can' t you ?
yes .
i don' t know what i' m doing .
i don' t know what i was thinking .
he was hanging there , and i just wanted him gone .
i didn' t care how .
pull yourself together .
pull yourself together .
how ?
he' s out there in pieces .
he' s out there , in the meat locker and on the table .
it' s a mess .
i' m going home now no .
svend , no !
you' re not going home .
get out there and get it overwith .
yes , you will .
yes , you will .
get it overwith now .
where were we ?
two chicky wickies ?
yes , please .
allrighty .
anything else ?
two meatballs and one pate .
and 200 grams of roast beef .
happy to oblige .
he' s going at it out back .
is he cutting down a tree ?
no , just working , as we say .
a small one like this ?
there you go .
we' il never talk about this again .
tomorrow we just say that there are no more chicken fillets ...
chicky wickies .
that' s what i call them .
svend' s chicky wickies .
svend , stop it .
yes , of course .
that' s that .
that' s that .
i nevertold you this
but my parents died when i was very young .
yes , you have .
many times .
and i wasn' t popular at school so i got beaten every day .
the other kids were free to pick on me
because i didn' t have any parents .
yes sirree .
they hit me and stole my lunch money .
that' s why i' m so skinny .
i didn' t get anything to eat before i began training as a butcher .
sometimes they' d hit me with stuff .
with wood ...
and with flashlights ...
and with a green bicycle pump ...
and with belts ...
enough with the examples .
it doesn' t matter .
what are you trying to say ?
i' m very well aware that i' m not a charming person .
people have always treated me rough .
they' ve called me names .
they called me ... you know ...
svend sweat ?
yes , let me tell you ...
i was always afraid .
i was afraid to go to school .
i was afraid to die .
i was afraid of girls .
i was afraid of people
and to some extent i still am , let me tell you .
but then i met tina
and i thought that things would get a lot better , but they didn' t .
that was when i decided to open my own shop .
how the fuck did you work that out ?
perhaps i didn' t say it right ...
no .
i' m tired and confused .
we' il see each other tomorrow .
but , bjarne , i would like ...
i can rephrase it .
i can put it more bluntly .
i' ve never been loved .
the cat is out of the bag .
that' s it .
and ?
and today ... here ...
what i had here today behind the counter , bjarne ...
it was fantastic .
it was great .
people spoke to me differently .
they smiled at me .
suddenly i was someone else and i really liked that .
don' t be angry , bjarne
but we can' t open tomorrow without more meat .
we can' t .
it stops here .
it' s sick and i don' t want to hear anymore about it .
that really hurt .
you' re insane .
it' s only a problem to be insane and not know it .
see you tomorrow .
i' m not here right now .
leave a message .
it' s ingrid grith .
i know how you feel
but i have to tell you that we' il turn off your brother tomorrow . his organs will be used for transplants .
we' re very grateful . have a nice evening .
hi .
hi .
i was just passing by .
do you always sit in there alone ?
yes .
sometimes .
the undertaker leaves at four .
he doesn' t have time for it all .
in the winter there' s a lot to do .
many give up at christmas
so i help out .
it' s more fun than feeding chickens .
i hear the shop is doing well .
oh , did you hear that ?
everybody is talking about you .
well ...
yes , business is very good .
i thought ... when the chickens have been fed ... have you eaten ?
no .
do you want to ?
i know a place .
hello ?
house hans ?
yes ...
that' s actually why i' m here .
you should just call me hans from now on .
it sounds silly anyway .
i guess you know that .
you shouldn' t make your job your identity .
oh ... yes ...
is that why you' re here ?
i was in the neighborhood so i thought i would drop by
and see how you were .
everything is fine .
does anyone know you' re here ?
no .
why do you ask ?
no reason , let me tell you ...
it' s been a long day .
lots of customers ...
let' s look at the shop then .
let' s start with the meat locker .
it' s really great .
let me tell you ...
dark and cold , huh ?
isn' t there any light ?
sure .
over in the corner .
i' m really impressed .
you' ve done a great job .
hello ?
hello , what happened ?
i think the door closed .
hello ?
let me out .
this isn' t funny .
hello .
i' m sorry i haven' t cleaned the place .
i had a break in ...
when ?
i don' t know .
a few years ago .
it' s okay .
all these skeletons .
have you killed them all ?
yes , except the whale .
i know it' s a bit morbid , but it' s been sort of a hobby .
like collecting coins .
you collect skeletons .
it sounds stupid , right ?
my colleague svend says that it' s sick .
how did you kill this one ?
that one i killed with a piece of cloth .
i don' t have any tea .
i have lots of weed .
will that do ?
yes , if you have milk and sugar .
why are you so chipper ?
what' s up with you ?
nothing .
yes , what' s up with you ?
i' ve met a girl .
really ?
i' ve met a girl .
it' s nothing .
nothing ?
let me tell you , it' s something .
we' re on our way now .
can' t you feel it ?
what the fuck are you wearing ?
come with me .
these are our new uniforms .
they' re great , don' t you think ?
yes , they' re very ...
come on .
there' s a hat too .
yes .
jesus fucking christ !
svend , you psycho .
you' ve gone completely insane .
i should like to explain .
thank you .
last night i went outside and he was lying in the street .
bjarne , it' s him .
it' s our realtor .
is that house hans ?
he just wants to be called hans .
let me finish .
there he was .
dead as a doornail .
i just took him inside .
we have to report it .
he was already dead .
that' s all .
that' s all .
i' m not lying .
he was dead .
i' m leaving .
i want out .
do we have to do this again ?
you haven' t got a clue , do you ?
what do you mean ?
he was already dead .
do you think that it' s a coincidence that you' ve met a nice girl ?
astrid ?
don' t you think that it' s strange that you meet a girl all of a sudden ?
hasn' t she asked about the shop ?
that' s how it works , bjarne .
you' re a success , and i' m a success .
that' s why anita wants you .
because we' re a success .
her name is astrid .
exactly .
could you carve him up ?
let' s set up over here .
okay .
anything else ?
no .
what time will that air ?
at four in the morning .
one dollar .
turn off the ventilator .
go ahead .
wait a minute .
what ?
his pulse is stable .
that can' t be true .
hi .
hi .
i' m sorry i' m late .
i' ve been out all night .
sure .
i' ve taken care of the shop .
i' ve been out all night .
do you know who called me ?
someone who found your brain ?
beate did .
beate ?
yes .
you know , the one you met at the barbecue .
she saw me on tv .
we went to that new club .
we got in for free , because they had also seen me on tv .
tonight we' re going bowling .
bowling ?
you' re going bowling ?
would you like to see a new car ?
have you bought a new car ?
yes , let me tell you ...
it' s almost entirely green .
what' s that ?
a small swede from the park .
svend , i can' t do this anymore .
you know the power lines behind the sawmill , right ?
everybody knows that they are dangerous ...
bjarne , what' s happening ?
make him leave .
make him disappear now !
take it easy .
hello .
i could like to talk to bjarne .
is he here ?
no comment .
anything else ?
no !
is bjarne coming ?
please don' t yell at me .
i can' t help it .
brain damage .
but eigil should still be treated like everybody else in this house .
is bjarne coming ?
no .
you shouldn' t be here .
please leave .
don' t you understand danish ?
i' m not going into this with you now .
leave .
but i' m the little eigil sweetie .
you may be , but not in here .
yes !
no .
yes !
no .
yes !
let me tell you something .
don' t threaten me with that giraffe .
please point it somewhere else , so that we may discuss this calmly .
would you ...
if you see bjarne , then say hello from me .
give him this .
it' s a small chipmunk .
from eigil .
there' s a dog .
closed
bjarne ?
bjarne , don' t worry .
he has left .
i don' t understand how that can happen .
it' s a miracle .
i didn' t believe it myself .
give him a shot or something .
we had a deal .
you saved him .
on the ventilator he never would have woken up .
then lock him up or keep him here .
is it because you' ve taken out a loan against his inheritance ?
no , the shop is doing fine .
eigil is a retard .
yes , no doubt , but he misses you .
no .
his head is just messed up .
i think you' re projecting .
maybe you have some issues .
have you tried eating a drumstick in front of him ?
i know that he' s a vegetarian .
he told the kitchen .
he' s obsessed with animals .
and you became a butcher .
can' t you see the problem ?
no .
i think you have to forgive eigil .
shut the fuck up .
what happened in the accident ?
keep him away from me .
lock him up .
i don' t give a fuck .
you need help and if you won' t let us help , i have to speak to svend .
how do you know svend ?
from tv .
he' s the only sane person that you' il listen to .
then go down to the shop and have a chat with him .
just keep eigil away from me .
we need more pate .
everything is selling like crazy .
the chickens have gone bad .
throw them out .
chop chop , we have ...
wow , her hands are big .
i haven' t begun on her yet .
what did she say ?
what do you say in a situation like that ?
she cried .
she yelled " let me out " .
i meant before that .
some nonsense about you and your brother and you needing a shrink .
i don' t want to talk about it .
four chickies .
no , chicky wickies .
chicky wickies .
that' s right .
yes , you .
out .
we don' t want anymore .
we' re trying to run a business .
give it to bjarne .
it' s for bjarne .
it' s a little dog .
if you don' t understand me , then let' s do it like this .
goodbye .
i know that you are there behind the bricks .
it' s me eigil , bjarne .
eigil the little funster is here .
no !
no , no , no ...
do you often come here ?
yes , sometimes .
you should come to the church tower and see shooting stars .
along with the weird priest ?
yes .
is it true that he was in a plane crash and had to eat his own wife ?
yes .
they were on their honeymoon .
they crashed into a mountain .
everybody died but him .
he was almost frozen when they found him .
he survived because he ate her .
why didn' t he eat someone else ?
i have no idea .
do you live with him ?
i have my own room .
when my parents died he was really sweet .
he helped with all the arrangements and had them sent home .
how did they die ?
like yours .
in germany between karlsruhe and stuttgart .
don' t you want to run away ?
run away ?
no , why do you want to do that ?
i don' t want to do this anymore .
a lot has happened since we opened the shop .
is it me ?
no , you' re the only good thing .
what is it then ?
everything .
svend has gone crazy .
and my ...
no , it doesn' t matter .
it' s boring to talk about .
if you don' t run away , i would like to help you .
no matter what it is .
hi , astrid .
you know holger from rotary , don' t you ?
yes .
i' m going to bed .
where have you been ?
out with bjarne .
goodnight .
my bjarne ?
yes , i think they' re dating .
i must say that they are doing fucking great .
but there' s something wrong .
what do you mean ?
those idiots forget to unzip before taking a piss .
and now they' re a big success .
people are standing in line .
i don' t understand it either .
with all due respect for your otherwise excellent dinner
i didn' t care for your chicken .
why not ?
it had a peculiar aftertaste .
the others loved it .
if only i hadn' t held that dinner , nobody would' ve heard about them .
what didn' t you like ?
it' s probably just me .
but it made me think of grethe .
i actually thought it tasted like grethe .
like grethe ?
fly away up to god and ask for fair weather .
hi .
what are you doing ?
i' m playing hide and seek .
you have to find little eigil .
come on .
i won' t hurt you .
all right .
i' m coming .
what are they doing here ?
it' s a chicken family .
they have been murdered by knife .
why did you do that ?
no reason .
that' s weird .
what' s your name ?
eigil per amager , but i only use eigil .
you' re bjarne' s brother .
yes .
yes , i am .
there , there .
you can' t bury animals here .
i can .
no .
yes , eigil can do everything .
have you seen bjarne ?
no .
no , i said .
he' s hiding in his shop .
look at the chicken .
it' s dead .
would you like to see some live chickens ?
i have seen that plenty of times
but i may be persuaded if they are big .
it' s a giraffe .
it' s my giraffe .
this is my dog skip .
this is skip .
it bit bjarne all the time .
it bit him ?
he kicked it sometimes .
he' s allergic to dogs .
but they let me , because i love dogs .
are dogs your favorite animal ?
no , all animals are .
this is eigil .
what' s this one called ?
it' s eigil .
do you know what this one is called ?
eigil ?
yes , exactly .
are we going out to the chickens ?
no , enough with the chickens .
bjarne , wait .
bjarne !
stay away from me .
it' s eigil , bjarne .
yes , it' s eigil , bjarne .
we are looking at the chickens .
stay away from me .
stay away from me .
stay away from me .
what are you doing ?
why did you do that ?
leave me alone .
what' s wrong ?
you can' t kick him like that .
why are you being an asshole ?
you don' t know what you' re talking about .
tina ...
what are you doing here ?
i just wanted to say hello .
how are you ?
i' m just fine .
i saw you on tv .
comes with the territory .
have you read my interviews ?
no .
i talked to the local paper .
i haven' t read that .
i say some excellent things .
at least , that' s what people tell me .
why haven' t you seen that ?
i just haven' t seen that .
i get to see movies for free .
and i can also go bowling .
but you don' t know how to bowl .
yes , i do .
i' ve seen it .
you can' t .
i beg to differ .
people say i' m good .
don' t you remember when you slipped in your own sweat ?
we had to go to the er on the way home .
don' t you remember ?
house hans petersen was a realtor .
he was probably fed up .
our children can be annoying .
he often talked about starting over .
so ... now he' s left .
we follow his trail to thailand where he was last seen .
yes , i saw him yesterday .
220 danes disappear every year .
we try to figure out why .
watch " missing danes " tonight .
it' s sausage holger .
you have to excuse my late call .
you deliver meat to svend and bjarne , right ?
they are my boys , so i would like to know how much they sell .
how many chickens ?
how much poultry a week ?
bjarne , i' m afraid i' ve done something stupid .
i don' t care .
listen to me .
i think i' ve crossed the line this time .
i don' t care .
give me the knife and open the shop .
yes , you' re right .
i' m probably just being hyper sensitive .
the bird is flying .
astrid , would you come in here ?
sure .
no , can' t he stay outside ?
okay .
if you can catch the black one , you' re the greatest .
you should listen to holger .
it' s about bjarne .
you should sit down .
well , astrid , the problem is that svend and bjarne ...
we are fairly certain that they are killing all my customers .
what are you talking about ?
they butcher them like cattle .
and they sell the meat in their shop .
it' s true .
they haven' t killed anyone .
i' m saying this for your own sake .
you should get out while you can .
thank you .
they have only bought 8 chickens .
why does their meat taste like grethe ?
i don' t know , but they haven' t done anything .
astrid , haven' t you noticed
that eigil isn' t the kind of guy you ask for help with the crosswords ?
those boys have problems .
eigil came out 7 minutes later than bjarne .
his brain didn' t get any oxygen .
those minutes are the problem .
how do you mean ?
the parents ruined everything .
they let eigil decide everything .
just until one day in june when it went too far .
you know about the accident , yes ?
no .
a giraffe was born in stockholm zoo
and eigil wanted to see it .
the family made a trip out of it .
eigil wanted to drive , and they let him .
even though bjarne objected .
eigil is eager to get there , so he drives fast .
very fast .
bjarne begged him to slow down .
he had his new wife with him .
but eigil wanted to go to stockholm and get a gander at the giraffe .
excuse the expression .
quite all right , holger .
they get to the coast , and then everything goes wrong .
ironically , it' s a deer that jumps out in front of the car
and eigil swerves to avoid it .
it' s a blood bath .
a halal butchering of olympic dimensions .
the parents and the wife die and eigil ends up in a coma .
bjarne breaks an arm and a leg
but the deer gets away scot free
because eigil chose to swerve .
afterwards bjarne snaps .
he roams around at night killing animals
until the police hands him over to me
and i , by the grace of god , take him in .
bjarne is sick .
stay away from him .
but it' s not until you put him together with that insane svend sweat
that it goes wrong .
i know that they' ve done this .
you' ve gone mad .
stay away from him .
hi , astrid .
look at me .
i' m playing with the little birds .
i' m flying .
eigil , let me show you what happens to chickens .
i' m going home .
okay .
are you going out tonight ?
no , i have a stomachache .
i don' t want to see any people .
then don' t go into the meat locker .
how about you ?
are you going over to astrid ?
no .
we can talk about it if you want .
no .
bjarne ...
please stay and talk .
svend , i can' t do it anymore .
see you .
hi .
is bjarne here ?
no .
you shouldn' t be here .
he shouldn' t be here .
you have to leave .
it' s dangerous to be here .
eigil will behave .
we have killed chickens for bjarne .
no , you have to respect me .
you have to leave now .
you don' t understand .
you can' t be here with me .
i don' t feel well .
i don' t want to talk about it .
go away .
he' il be good .
he' il be good .
we just want to talk to bjarne .
do you know where he is ?
why can' t you just leave ?
we want to talk to him .
he' s out in the meat locker .
come on .
i forgot that there are two of you .
yes .
is astrid around ?
come on inside .
they' re pretty .
do you like plants ?
sure .
mine usually die .
how do you get them to grow like that ?
light and warmth .
a bright and warm room creates life .
you have to praise them and tell them that they' re pretty .
all these plants have helped me
to fill out the void after grethe .
you know what it' s like .
i couldn' t let her go for a long time .
where is astrid ?
grethe seemed to be in me .
she was in a way .
how do you mean ?
didn' t you eat her ?
yes , i did .
i' m glad i did to this day .
is astrid coming soon ?
she probably is .
the good thing about astrid is that she lives in this life .
you should do the same .
or at least try to .
you can' t turn a turtle into a racehorse .
but you can turn it into a fast turtle .
okay .
how long will astrid be ?
she actually went to your shop .
weren' t you tired ?
has astrid been here ?
no .
why ?
it' s just that ...
what , bjarne ?
i' m sorry .
i thought ...
it doesn' t matter .
see you tomorrow .
you said you didn' t want to see her .
what the fuck are you doing ?
are you crazy ?
stay away from me .
it was just a joke .
a joke ?
it' s not funny to lock people up .
psychos !
i ...
don' t !
stay away from me .
you' re all crazy .
you and you and your crazy brother .
fuck you !
please don' t leave .
stay away from me .
don' t !
well , that' s up to her .
take it easy .
bjarne , i' m leaving .
i' m leaving .
i didn' t know that she ...
can i hold your hand ?
no .
just a little bit ?
no .
brother bjarne ...
don' t you even have two for me ?
there are no more chicky wickies until svend comes back .
we were looking forward to it .
maybe i can do something , but the meat will be different .
what kind of meat ?
chicken .
some other chicken .
as long as the marinade is the same .
sure .
it' s svend' s marinade .
i have to ask you all to leave .
the shop is closed .
we' re from the fda .
thank you .
i' il take over from here .
i have to ask you all to leave .
the shop is closed .
we' re from the fda .
okay , chicky wickies for everybody .
what' s happening ?
you' re through .
where is the sweating swine ?
i don' t know .
what do you want ?
leif larsen from fda .
we' ve received a report
that you sell unauthorised meat .
where' s the queue ?
why is there no queue ?
the fda is here .
svend , wait .
what' s going on ?
you found a new victim , didn' t you ?
you' re out to get me .
you may succeed .
i may be guilty .
done is done .
so just take the meat .
take my meat and run out if you have any use for it .
do you ?
this is bjarne .
i would like to stress that he is not involved .
i' m guilty .
if you can talk about guilt .
but i would like to ask if any of you can look me in the eye and say
that i don' t deserve my success ?
wait ...
no , you can' t .
you all want to make something that people will love .
i may have ...
don' t mind them .
they do that sometimes .
bjarne , that really hurt .
this is just chicken in marinade .
that can' t be .
i can' t find anything .
there are some joint butts , but you find that everywhere .
oh ...
then we checked the place .
that' s surely always a good thing .
if there' s no more meat , what did you sell ?
chicken .
then it' s over , bjarne .
people don' t want that .
then it' s over .
i don' t think so .
yes , i think so
and that' s good .
i tasted your marinade .
yes ...
it' s good .
it' s the best i' ve ever tasted .
it' s good .
i don' t think the meat is all that good .
i think the marinade did it .
are you saying that my marinade is good ?
yes , your marinade is good .
everybody thinks so .
one wasn' t allowed on the bus under any circumstances .
they were afraid of the pig .
we' il work it out , eigil .
come on .
what an outrage .
that' s what they said on the bus .
throw the ball , eigil .
no , svend will take it .
no , i won' t , idiot .
i have my own .
yes .
you have to throw them in order to play .
then throw yours , svend .
i' il throw it , when he does .
you' re kidding ?
my ball is bigger than yours .
i beg to differ .
it is .
i' m not discussing this .
mine is bigger .
i can even blow it up more .
can i sit here for a while ?
sure .
astrid !
isn' t my ball bigger than his ?
yes , yours is much bigger , eigil .
stop that nonsense .
come on down and measure them , or i' il go home , let me tell you !
my ball is the biggest .
everybody loves eigil .
shut up .
svend sweats , but eigil is sweet .
i would rather sweat than be you , four eyes .
we don' t say four eyes !
retard four eyes .
everybody prefers eigil .
really ?
should we ask people if they prefer you or me ?
no , because you don' t dare .
yes !
