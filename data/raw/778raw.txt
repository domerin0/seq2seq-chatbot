the d. c. sniper is like the jackie robinson of crime .

tell them , eddie .
he broke into the white leagues with that crime .
that crime took planning .
not only planning , it took math .
you know , it took math to figure out all them trajectories to shoot from the back of an automobile .
that' s white folk shit right there .
with the problems we got , black folks used to could say ,

she ain' t weavin ' it up like most of y' all in here .

raised you like you was my own son .
okay .
i gotta go , miss emma .
when you get back here , you better tell me why jesus wept .

' cause they wouldn' t let him put jelly on his biscuit before he left .
i ain' t seen you in two days .
and why you look so damn tired ?
ricky , just be a man and let me know .
i' m being a man .

if i was like mike , would you like me ?
brad pitt .
mel gibson .
bill clinton .
bill clinton ?
he' s a freak , and i likes me a freaky man .

dan quayle couldn' t spell " potato .
you know what ?
you right about that , checkers .
you know what ?
you can be a stupid white man and get elected president .
twice !
all i' m saying is if you' re gonna have oral relations with an ugly , fat white girl with low self esteem , lock the door .
lock the door !
click .
handle your business .
there it is .
calvin , come look .
they' re gonna lock your ass up for talkin ' like that .
when did they put that up ?
guess it ain' t no titty bar .
hold up .
i can' t believe this .
quentin !
hey , calvin .
you like our sign ?
not too flashy , i hope .
i don' t want it to fight the funk of the neighborhood .
i thought this was a club .
what is nappy cutz ?
you never heard of us ?
it' s a franchise , the black man' s answer to supercuts .
got ten locations nationwide .
this' il be the first one in chicago .
ten chairs with every amenity the african american male desires .
on my block ?
it' s just an alternative .
you the man .
your shop is legendary .
only business on the block to survive the riots of ' 68 .
we can' t compete with you .
i gotta go .
listen , when 24/ 7 opens , i' d love to buy you a latte .
i can buy my own damn latte .
i know what this is .
you' re tryin ' to compete with us .
it' s not a competition .
it' s a rout .
your business will be closed in six months , seven at the most .
when the bank forecloses , i' m gonna buy your shop and turn it into a more viable cash cow ,
like a bally' s or a jamba juice .
we could bypass all the stress if you would sell it to me now .
but of course you wouldn' t do that ... too much pride .
and i respect that .
i respect that , too .
you be safe out there .
i was gonna say the same thing to you .
what did slick head negro want ?
these guys fittin ' to open a shop on our block ?
they' re gonna take all our customers .
quality land development buyin ' up everything .
we just gotta step up our game .
hey , rick , you handled that deposit for me ?
you gonna have to cool it on these extra activities .
i don' t care about your vampire hours as long as you do what i ask .
it' s not what you think .
i had some ...
some bullshit to do .
you should' ve asked me , someone more dependable .
both of you can kiss my ass .
hold up , don' t fall apart .
don' t fall apart .
not right now , okay ?
we got competition on the block .
and i guess change , that' s a good thing , right ?
well , it' s free enterprise .
this is america .
shut up , dinka .
survival of the fittest .
says the privileged white boy .
the privileged white boy do a better job on that fade .
you' re starting to cross the line .
relax yourself .
quit it .
quit it .
don' t sweat it , cal .
we got your back no matter what .
come on , everybody , let' s go back .
this ain' t nothin ' .
i' ve seen this many times .
they come and they go .
we gonna be all right .
we gonna be fine .
man , why you trippin ' back there ?
why you frontin ' , man ?
i know you' re supposed to be the superstar , but don' t you ever roll up on my customers .
what was you thinkin ' ?
you' re right , man .
okay , it' s my bad .
it' s my bad .
his fade was a little crooked , though .
it' s hard being that good , ain' t it ?
look , cal , it' s nappy cutz .
com .
it' s the professionalism that is bestowed upon me
when i come into nappy cutz that i appreciate .
did that boy say " bestowed upon me " ?
that' s what it sounded like .
it' s the bikini waxes that i love ...
look at the couches , man , and the lighting .
look at that .
last week i had me a milk bath .
what ?
oh , baby .
they dippin ' sisters in milk over there ?
give me some cookies .
i' il go over there myself .
was that ...
that was him !
it looked like him .
that' s a look alike .
how can they get him ?
turn that mess off .
that little girl is nasty !
back to work .
checker fred , back to checkers .
my boys up in memphis go to nappy cut .
they said it' s off the chain .
they got honeys in bikinis , be serving wine when they walk through the door .
that ain' t nothin ' .
i heard they got fish in the floor , swimming .
you standin ' on top of them .
you could pick a fish out , get it baked , broiled , fried , grilled , fondued , souffld ,
sauted , sushied , all that .
fondued ?
i like that whole massage thing .
that' s tight .
let me tell you all somethin ' .
that' s not a real barbershop .
that' s a fake , franchise , corporate version of a barbershop .
that' s why they got gimmicks .
they ain' t got no real character up in there .
a real barbershop got real people , real conversation , and most of all , real barbers , and that' s what we got here .
calvin , my man !
oh , god .
kenard .
hold up .
dude , look ...
i love you , cuz .

yeah , it' s herbal .
you must be a lot like me .
you lactose intolerant .
yeah , i' m lactose intolerant .
i go near a cow , and my behind blow up like dizzy gillespie .
downright flatulent .
and the smell .
man , the smell that come out of there , it' s so bad , sometimes i have to set myself outside .
i' m not lactose intolerant , all right ?
i have a very healthy metabolism .
i tried to have some of them little , bitty milky ways ... the small one .
i ate two of them at a party one night , and , man , it just got ...
i just couldn' t control it .
it was the lactose intoleration .
listen , i' m not lactose intolerant .
look , man , all that' s fine .
i' m trying to help you .
it' s just not fair for your date .
you gotta think about if you on a date and you up here sneakin ' ' em off , and she' s trying to wonder ,
he seem like he dressed nice , he seems clean , but what is that smell ?
and you tryin ' to act like you ain' t got no ...
take care of yourself .
sir , i am very nice to black people , okay ?
nice to black people ?
you better be , especially me .
i keep my stuff with me , okay ?
i cut you .

your precious love
your precious love
heaven must have sent you from above
must have sent you , baby

eddie , where you goin ' ?

you wanna know my name , right ?
yeah .
loretta .
yeah .
i' m not saying we made out of money .
i' m just saying we need to step it up a little bit .
we' re about to get punked by nappy cutz .
if you don' t think big , you' il never be big .
calvin , you run a family operation .
you do not need to step it up .
them clowns at nappy cutz , they' re not about to take away your business .
your shop is a neighborhood institution .
come on .
people don' t care about institutions .
they got fish in the floor .
just swimmin ' around .
you can get it fried , baked , sauted , sushi ...
who told you that ?
little rodney at the shop .
little rodney told you he sawfish in the floor .
well , he actually didn' t see the fish in the floor , but his cousin in atlanta sawfish .
you know that' s ridiculous .
little rodney probably heard it from somebody who heard it from somebody else who was at nappy cutz when they dropped their filet o fish on the floor .
that' s ridiculous .
i can' t believe you said that .
sun salutation , ladies .
feet together , bringing it to prayer pose .
and reach !
butterfly , butterfly .
bringing it back to prayer pose .
deep ujjayi breath .
breathing in radiance , beauty , light .
breathing out any heavy burdens .
the key to enlightenment is to work through your anger , not have your anger work through you .
first position .
one , two , three .
he ain' t shit !
he ain' t shit !
jimmy !
what' s the deal ?
what' s up ?
lookin ' good , baby boy !
always , always .

just a little while ago , he was cuttin ' hair .
good morning .
good morning .
alderman brown' s office .
good morning , maggie .
good morning , sir .
any messages ?
yes , sir .
a whole stack .
good morning , alderman .
good morning .
good morning , sir .
good morning , jimmy .
i' d like a moment if you have it .
i don' t .
this faithful constituent is in need of counsel , and i have to provide it .
reach one , teach one .
remember that .
it' s an issue of vital importance and it' il only take a minute .
you have 59 seconds .
thank you .
have a seat .
thank you , sir .
not you .
i wanted to bring to your attention a particular concern of mine .
are you familiar with calvin' s barbershop on 79th and exchange ?
yeah , i' m aware of it .
they' re opening a nappy cutz across the street .
yeah , i know all about it .
shouldn' t we do something about that ?
why should we ?
competition is a cornerstone of democracy .
the future is not what it used to be .
remember that .
but you did say you wanted to keep that particular area fertile for small business interests .
fertile .
i did say that , didn' t i ?
this boy is gonna be the governor of the state of illinois one day if he learns to do what i say when i say it .
now , i' m not one for explanations , explanatory things explained .
write a report and have it on my desk by the end of the month .
sir , i think we should move faster than that .
think need , not speed .
it' s better to measure a thing ten times and cut once than to measure once and cut ten times .
your minute is up , son .
this is gonna be great for the neighborhood .
we' il see .
here he comes .
what' s up , samir ?
not much .
how are you doing ?
all right .
very nice shirt on you .
we need to talk to you , calvin .
what' s going on ?
we' ve been approached by quality land development .
they' re building a cineplex there and they' re making us an offer .
we' re thinking about taking that offer .
the money isn' t bad .
plus , the money isn' t bad .
stew sold him his cleaners and took his viagra popping ass to miami .
i ain' t mad at the brother .
what' s that got to do with me ?
you got your mind made up .
no , we haven' t .
but i bet if you came on board and sold them the barbershop , they' d probably pay us double .
that would change my mind .
absolutely .
y' all know i can' t do that .
why not ?
we' ve been there since ' 58 .
so if y' all wanna sell and go down to florida with them funky ass voting booths , you can go ahead .
but i' ve gotta keep mine .
you' re making a mistake , bro .
no , my friend , you' re thinking about this all the wrong way .
calvin , there' s a lot of money to be made here , son .
go talk to your boy .
come on , babies .
today is the day .
we came a long road to get here .
pay attention .
lighten up .
you come in here some days
looking like joe frazier in jamaica .
people don' t like that .
you' re too pretty .
learn how to cook .
i know how to cook .
make him hush puppies or a spanish omelet .
hey there , calvin .
hey , calvin .
what' s up , cal ?
yo , isaac .
what' s up , boss man ?
you all know why i called this meeting .
nappy necks , whatever they want to call theyself across the street , is openin ' up in three weeks , and they' re tryin ' to get our ass out of here ,
like it or not , and we ain' t havin ' it .
you know what i mean ?
damn straight .
so my plan is this .
fire up the barbecue in the back , have a little customer appreciation cookout .
that' s smart .
that' s good thinking .
just burgers and dogs , free haircuts for the kids .
show the people we care about ' em .
show them that whatever they goin ' through , we down with them .
you feel me ?
i feel you , calvin .
definitely .
man , i feel all of that .
it all makes sense .
that' s why i got to raise your booth rent .
what ?
you can' t do that .
it' s my first day .
why , calvin ?
we got to pay for this somehow .
forget about it .
we in a crisis , and you can double my rent .
you don' t even pay no rent .
what ?
in that case , triple it , then .
not to throw salt , but why you don' t pay no booth rent ?
i don' t pay rent ' cause i don' t pay rent .
okay ?
so pour out your cup of haterade and sop it up off the floor and get some business .
also , i want to institute a couple of new rules .
you comin ' at me with too much .
that' s all for one day .
take baby steps .
rule number one ... no more profanity .
i know you about to say something .
don' t even say it .
i ain' t sayin ' nothin ' .
i' m thinkin ' it .
rule number two ... don' t be late .
who was it that said , " be on time for something other than ...
" ... before 11 : 00 at the club . " that' s what it was .
y' all got jokes .
my bad .
kenard , them jet beauties , they got to go , man .
good .
they' re my inspiration , my muses .
he made me take down my picture of lola falana .
i can' t cut without the butt .
that' s perfect for me ' cause maybe you' il quit .
that' s what i thought .
we' re going to be more family friendly around here , and i want everybody to start greeting the customers by name .
how are we supposed to know everybody' s name ?
that' s ridiculous .
he' s not even showing up .
yap !
yap !
yap !
yap !
all that yapping leads me to rule number three ... no more loud talking .
what ? !
watch it .
thank you , calvin .
horace , thanks , man .
i appreciate your coming through .
all right , calvin .
take care , man .
no problem .
appreciate your business .
all right , calvin .
god bless .
all right , calvin .
bye , horace .
you' re next .
what' s up , cal ?
thanks for what you' re doing .
we appreciate it .
hi , jimmy !
hey , everybody .
this is not happening .
we got an appointment .
you gotta get out of the chair .
eight mile gave me this time exactly .
we' re almost done .
i' il be right with you .
i' m terribly sorry about the inconvenience .
calvin , this is why black business does not succeed .
we' re never on time .
you' re always coming in late .
you leave early .
giving to the needy and the greedy instead of the deserving .
and double booking our clients !
why do you have a schedule if you ain' t gonna use it ?
it is 11 : 02 .
that means your man has to get out of the chair .
that means it' s my time , and i' m not havin ' it .
come on , man , you gotta bounce .
this is ridiculous .
vamoose .
come on , let' s go .
get him .
sit your ass down !
come on , have a seat .
enough of it already .
sit on down , west wing .
up in here like you' re from lifestyles of the rich and famous .
only reason you' re in here is ' cause your daddy didn' t use a life style .
i' il tell y' all one thing ... all y' all are doomed to fail .
it was nice and quiet in here , the way i like it .
just hush .
everything was hush .
free barbecue ... food , fun , and free haircuts for the kids .
bring ' em on down .
bring all the kids .
here you go , girl .

i should' ve known you was out here actin ' a fool .
i' m tryin ' to teach little sister souljah here some discipline .

raised ?
maybe if you stopped raising your hand to your mouth , you wouldn' t look like shamu of the south side .
okay .
i see where you' re trying to go with it .
what kind of man treat a little girl that way ?
i wouldn' t expect you to know what a man is .
but i' m gonna give you a clue .

you can play ball up in here , man .

top of the line .
this is what a barbershop' s supposed to look like .
this is leather .
word ?
that' s pleather .
it' s leather .
it' s ugly .
lookin ' around , it' s a nice shop , but it don' t have no character .

we got character , we got conversation , and we got ...
we ain' t got one of these .
lord have mercy !

i' m looking to get high end stuff at low end prices .
you know i can .
legally .
you mean like with a receipt legally ?
like i ain' t steal it .
if the police walk up , do i gotta drop it and run ?
i can get anything you need .
nappy cutz won' t know what hit ' em .
this is not about nappy cutz .
this is about personal enhancement , personal growth .
expansion .
not nappy cutz .
right .
they won' t know what hit ' em .
come on over here and get your hair cut .
i' m working at calvin jr' s .
come be my first customer .
what you mean , " uh uh " ?
can you hook me up with isaac ?
the one with the " i " cut in the back ?
you got a ' fro !
you can' t be gettin ' the " i " cut in the back .
condoleezza .
with all that white house money she makin ' , you' d think she could afford herself a makeover .
if i was in the white house , i' d be fly all the time .
if you was in the white house , you' d be ghetto as hell .
she' d have the president all corn rowed out , talking about , " u. s. , fool .
u. s. , fool .
the president would be a thug .
she think a head of state' s a sexual position .
i' m inviting heads of state today .

the alderman' s taking a walking tour of the block before friday' s city council meeting to let the constituency know that he' s concerned .
concerned ?
about november , right ?
i talked him into talking to you ... good publicity .
you could' ve asked me first .
i know .
but it was a spur of the moment thing .
we don' t do politics in here .
it' s a place of business .
this ain' t no community center .
you know what ?
you sound just like your daddy right now .
we will not be silenced .
when the fbi gassed the black panthers out , we found a place to be today .
thank you , brother calvin .
brother calvin !
we will continue to provide books and classes , food and clothing through our outreach program .
that' s right , brother .
and when the pigs show up , they' re gonna show up with guns .
we ain' t gonna do nothin ' but show up with our guns !
then they gonna start shootin ' .
then we gonna start shootin ' !
that' s right , brother !
i' m tellin ' you , every last one of them' s gonna get shot !
that' s right .
then all of us is gonna get shot !
and all of us is gonna die together !
let' s make it happen !
black power !
black power !
black power !
yeah !
black power !
that' s us !
black power !

look what we got ... we got a lady barber .
we didn' t have this back in the day .
what' s your name ?
terri .
sarah ?
terri .
lalowe' s gonna have to come back and let you give me a little trim .
trim ?
a haircut .
terri , if you wanna be down , vote lalowe brown .
you remember that .
this is calvin' s barbershop .
this is a cornerstone of the black community for some 40 odd years .
i' ve been coming down here many a saturday afternoon , get myself straight for sunday morning .
but i wanna introduce you to the man himself , the man who quantifies and epitomizes the institutional possibilities of black hair .
he is a potentiating progenitor in all kinds of fine ways .
he' s my fine friend , this brother right here , calvin .
how you doin ' ?
calvin palmer .
how you doin ' , son ?
all right .
calvin , you are a pillar of this fine community .
how is everything going for you with all this social change happening down here ?
well , mr. brown , as you know , there is a lot of change ...
there is a lot of change , and change is hard sometimes , right ?
but if we want to stand together as a community ,
we will find a way to survive .
tell it !
tell it , lo .
that' s right .
you let lalowe lay it down for you .
if you wanna stay afloat , we got to ... ... you gonna have to rock the boat .
because if they want to send us packin ' , baby , it' s on and crackin ' !
and if they try to mess with this brother , then it' s gonna be on like a mother !
that' s a little rough .
if you want to stay around , y' all know what you gotta do .
vote for lalowe brown !
hey , calvin , why don' t you get me a little shape up ?
' cause i' ve been running around .
you got a chair for me ?
yeah , right here .
of course we got one for you .
kenard !
kenard !
let kenard cut your hair .
hold on , hold on .
wait a minute .
no .
get on over there , get low .
sit right on down , so low .
nice to meet you .
how you doin ' ?
wait a minute .
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
kenard here is one of our prima donna barbers .
front chair .
you ain' t had your hair cut till ...
kenard .
yeah .
yeah .
let' s take a picture .
thank you , brother .
yeah , okay .
all right .
enjoy yourself , low below .
you just relax , down low .
we on tv , man .
i know .
this is must see tv .
it' s gonna be good .
this is why i love this community ,
' cause there' s a historical context for every action that takes place here .
i plan to die here .
we' re running short on time .
if we could speed this up ?
you can' t rush the best , jimmy .
he ain' t the best .
he ain' t ask you , man .
well , who' s the best , then , youngblood ?
you the best ?
no doubt .
isaac rosenberg .
the best barber in the state of illinois .
the best barber on this rock we call earth .
come on down to cal' s .
our rainbow coalition right here .
yeah , this is integration right here .
what' s up , ma ?
richie ?
you' re feelin ' yourself way too much .
don' t sweat the technique .
what technique ?
you cut like a bitch .
carvin ' i' s in the back of people' s head ?
your skills is limited .
my skills are limited ?
where your skills at ?
this ain' t the time .
ain' t in cuttin ' hair .
must be slobbin ' terri in the locker room .
what ?
no .
you ain' t supposed to air our dirty laundry like that .
we on tv .
what is he talking about ?
dinka , it wasn' t like that . ... of populist politics .
thug love !
thug love !
it was not like that .
everybody' s hatin ' on me .
' cause i' m competent ?
you don' t make this shop .
i have lately .
i will confront all of those forces that are trying to change , that are trying to make things happen .
they don' t treat barbers like this at nappy cutz .
why don' t you go find out ?
you on that bullshit .
go find out .
we don' t need you around here if you don' t wanna be here .
fine , man .
all right .
get out of the chair , man .
no , you stay here .
in november , i plan to establish this barbershop as my headquarters .
at calvin' s barbershop , we' re gonna make this institution one of the leading institutions , like a torpedo moving towards the future .
yes , indeed .
all right .
kenard , just a little off the top .
i really think it' s time for us to move along .
come on , jimmy , just two seconds .
my bad , brother .
i skipped you .
why don' t you just let me fade you up ?
how about a nice quo vadis ?
what' d you do to my head ?
don' t even look at that .
is that my head ?
i' m gonna kill you !
i' m gonna kill you !
you a grown man !
you don' t do that to kenard !
get out of here !
and far from its roots as a family establishment , this was the scene today at 79th and exchange at calvin' s barbershop when alderman lalowe brown stopped by for a photo opportunity and haircut .
or shall i say scalping ?
needless to say , i doubt very seriously if the alderman will be frequenting calvin' s barbershop anytime soon .
nice .
who is it ?
it' s rick .
what do you want ?
i wanna talk to you .
i feel bad .
good .
i' m busy .
open the door .
we gotta talk about this .
there' s nothing to discuss .
dinka , i messed up .
what happened between me and terri was foul .
it should have never happened .
i didn' t mean to hurt you .
i' m sorry .
apology accepted .
can we discuss this tomorrow ?
you remember shawna , right ?
hi .
what' s up , shawna ?
handle that .
i' il get at you tomorrow .
maybe the day after .
you should see her when i' m drinkin ' .
' cause i know her .
exactly right , exactly right .
what are you doing here ?
the question is , what you doin ' here ?
look a little shady to me .
you come up to my shop today and got the nerve to be huddled up with this shark .
don' t come in here accusing me of some malicious and egregious act when what you should be doin ' is apologizing for making me look like a goddamn fool today .
that' s what you should be doing .
lalowe .
ease up .
it' s cool .
all right there , youngblood .
ain' t nothin ' going on in here , just business .
i' il bet .
it' s true .
in fact , the alderman and i were just talking about you .
well , about your business .
i undervalued the importance of your shop to this community .
that' s my bad .
it' d be a shame to see it all go away for naught .
man , i' m from the south side .
don' t try to hustle me .
no hustle .
a hustle implies one side wins , the other side loses .
i' m proposing a win win .
i' m proposing that nappy cutz never sees the light of day .
is that right ?
i' il turn it into a nightclub .
your barbershop will continue to thrive without any interference from me or from anyone else .
and this miracle happens if i do what ?
not tell people what i saw here tonight ?
what' d you see tonight ?
what' d you see in here tonight , calvin ?
nothing .
nothing .
have a seat .
no , i' d rather stand .
all you have to do is talk .
the city council meeting is tomorrow .
we need those other business owners on your block to sell .
if you were to express to them and to the governing board that you believe in quality land' s proposal , your voice could be the determining factor .
at least , i think so .
this could be a shitload of money for the whole district .
not to mention , it could be a nice little windfall for calvin .
a $200, 000 windfall .
now , that' s a nice piece of pocket change .
you could take your wife on down to jamaica .
the real one , not that one in queens .
it' d be a nice kick start to your kid' s college fund .
you have a son , don' t you ?
yeah , i got a son .
all you gotta do is talk .
$200, 000 .
i' m not asking you for a whole lot , just to ... come on down and ... ... just talk .
just talk .
all right .
see you tomorrow .
win win .
you stalking me ?
just wanna talk .
ain' t nothin ' to say .
let me drive you to work .
how am i gonna look rollin ' up in your freak mobile ?
terri , we work together .
we need to have a conversation .
listen to what i got to say .
after that , you ain' t got to speak to me ever again .
i' il drop you off around the corner .
get in the car .
please .
terri , i really ain' t been myself lately .
ricky , before you even say anything , i need you to know that thug gangta player bullshit is over for me .
i' m done with that in my life .
but you don' t even know me , what i' m about .
i see you every day ...
late , sleepin ' in the locker room , runnin ' ho' s day and night .
how is that not knowing you ?
boy !
i' m just gettin ' my backpack .
relax .
what is this , a warrant ?
why didn' t you say anything ?
i couldn' t tell nobody i was studying for the fuckin ' ged .
it' s embarrassing .
but you passed .
yeah .
yeah , but honestly , though , now that i got it ,
i don' t even know what it means .
it means you give a damn about your life .
you should be proud .
i' m proud of you .
don' t start paying me compliments and stuff ,
' cause then i gotta give one back to you .
we' d be all over each other again , and don' t nobody want that .
i don' t want it .
for the record ...
i kind of liked the old terri before all the changes .
loud and angry all the time ?
real .
all the time .
man , i hope you hittin ' that !
miss emma , is somethin ' wrong ?
nothing a little prayer can' t handle , or my pistol .
what' s the matter ?
they wanna make this funky little place into a co op .
what ?
i can' t afford that down payment .
i' m gonna have to move .
don' t you own this place ?
just because i don' t own it don' t mean it' s not mine .
you' ve been livin ' here , like , what ?
a long time , long enough to wipe your nasty little butt .
and a whole lot of others , too .
but it' s been worth it , though .
we can' t lose you , miss emma .
it' s about time for me to retire anyway .
my brother has a nice place out in arizona .
you ever been to arizona ?
hot as hell , but i got some nice hats .
how can you leave chicago ?
on the bus .
same way i got here .
good morning there , youngblood .
you up early .
they fumigating your crib again ?
i thought it' d be a good day to walk and see the trees and dew .
yeah , they fumigating .
i had a cockroach in my house so big , i thought it was shaq .
you' re crazy .
let me ask you something .
what ?
you done worked and lived around here for what , 34 , 35 years ?
yeah , i guess 30 and some change .
i ain' t tryin ' to clown , but ...
i hope not .
you know i got jokes .
don' t you start nothin ' .
let me ask you ... is this the life you wanted ?
or did you ever think you could do better ?
what the hell keeps you comin ' back here every day ?
well , calvin , you know , if i was a bettin ' man ,
i' d say the reason i come back in day in and day out is the free chair .
get real .
hold it !
get off him , pig !
... some very sad news for all of you , and that is that martin luther king was shot and was killed tonight in memphis , tennessee .
in this difficult day , in this difficult time for the united states , it' s perhaps well to ask what kind of a nation we are ...
this ain' t right .
we should be honoring the man' s memory , we shouldn' t be doing this .
yeah .
yeah , you' re right .
i' m gonna get on out of here .
i need to go check on loretta .
she' s talking about moving back to georgia .
i would only say that i can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling .
i had a member of my family killed .
but he was killed by a white man .
what we need in the united states ...
you be safe out there .
yeah , i will , man .
don' t worry about me .
i' il probably stop by montgomery ward' s , pick up a tv , washer and dryer , lamps .
you need anything ?
move , eddie !
no !
eddie , get out of there !
no !
no !
i' il stay a little while longer , man .
yeah , so after all that quieted down , your daddy told me i ain' t never have to pay for my chair again .
that' s the kind of man your father was .
he was a man' s man .
he used to always call me a hero .
the funny thing is i never saw it that way .
i didn' t save the shop , calvin .
the shop saved me .
a lot like it did for ricky .
i ain' t have no life before this .
as far as i' m concerned , my life began on july 4 , 1967 , when i came through that back door and your father gave my black ass a break .
so i' d be sad if somethin ' was to ever happen to this place .
but i' d be all right , though .
oh , yeah , eddie be fine .
hey , what' s up , y' all ?
calvin , can i have a word with you for a second ?
what you want , man ?
well , i know these are tough times for you , cuz .
it' s times like these when men must rise up and make the right choice .
is that right ?
yeah .
it' s about the truth .
each and every one of us has our own truth , a truth that we must live with for the rest of our lives .
is there a point to this ?
my truth is across the street .
i appreciate the job , cuz .
i' il always love you for it .
but i gotta bounce .
y' all goin ' broke around this mug .
boy , i swear .
all right , all right .
and if anybody wanna come over anytime and hoop it up , ring a player , you know ?
all this silence got my gut grumblin ' .
i' m gonna run down to berry' s , get me a pastrami and fries .
eddie , a man at your age should be watching what he eats .
if you don' t knock the fork out of my hand ,
i won' t knock the spear out of yours , okay , somalia ?
eddie , get me that chicken tamale and strawberry shake special .
get old checkers a ham and cheese on some honky bread , mustard , hold the mayo .
get me a mountain dew and chopped salad .
i' il take some chili fries , onion rings , and a pot pie with egg on it .
okay , that' s gonna be three orders of " hell , no " and two sides of " ask your mama " and a large cup of " negro , please .
grumpy old man .
hey , big c , where you headed ?
nowhere .
just got a little business to handle .
i' il be back .
and when they build all this stuff , they make it totally unaffordable for the people who live here to stay here .
now , we' re south side people with south side money , and that ain' t much .
so i' m against the proposed quality land development project on 79th and exchange .
you tell it , sister !
that' s right !
very good !
that' s right !
quiet .
okay .
before we adjourn and make our decision , is there anyone else who' d like to be heard on this matter ?
let' s get this thing over with .
i' d like to say somethin ' .
sir .
what' s he gonna say ?
shut up .
shut up .
a little nervous .
i haven' t felt like this since i met my wife' s pops .
my name is calvin palmer .
i own calvin' s barbershop over on 79th .
been there since 1958 .
and all i' d like to say is that all change isn' t bad .
who can argue with progress ?
better schools , cleaner streets ... something we need on the south side .
and i want the best for my son just like my parents wanted the best for me .
so some change on 79th is well needed and well deserved .
oh , yeah .
also , i' m happy that people outside our community are starting to find the value in our neighborhoods .
but ... if that means selling our soul just to make a quick buck ,
i ain' t with that shit .
it' s not worth it .
that' s why i' m not sellin ' out ... ... like some people i know .
sir , do you know why jesus wept ?
no .
no , i don' t .
well , when lazarus died ,
martha and mary , they cried over his body .
when jesus sawtheir pain , he couldn' t help but cry , too .
so that' s why jesus wept .
that' s how i feel when i look at people like hank tolliver and gertrude rose and miss emma bein ' driven out ... ... ' cause they don' t fit the plan of the new developers .
we gotta realize that people make this community , not $5 coffees and $20 mugs .
it' s the people .
and once you lose the people , you lose the neighborhood .
so if i had to say , i would deny
quality land development' s proposal to tear up 79th because it just ain' t worth it .
thank you .
that' s my friend !
that' s my friend !
thank you .
thank you , mr. palmer .
we' il take a brief recess and we' il come back with our decision .
you' re through .
you know that , don' t you ?
that was beautiful , man .
thanks .
how much they offer you ?
not enough .
we have reached a unanimous decision .
the proposal from quality land development has been approved .
this meeting is over .
