for those regarded as warriors ...
when engaged in combat ... the vanquishing of thine enemy can be the warrior' s only concern .
suppress all human emotion and compassion ...
... kill whoever stands in thy way , even if that be lord god , or buddha himself .
this truth lies at the heart of the art of combat .
