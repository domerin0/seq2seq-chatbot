i am there .
yes , i am there
i see ...
i see
there' s the contact .
he' s just entered .
the contact has entered the contact ...
the dead ... i see the dead the city of the dead
hold the link , don' t break it hold the link it' s critical for mary .
don' t break the link , don' t break it
mary mary ...
the soul that pines for eternity ... shall outspan death .
you dweller of the twilight void come dunwich .
i' m afraid mary' s dead .
no ...
alright , maybe i' ve got no imagination , but your story is a little tough to swallow .
james mclewin , busted twice for peddling and possession .
that' s right .
so ?
and you expect me to believe that mary woodhouse died out of sheer fright while you were having a seance ?
ok fellas .
you help us and we' il help you .
what were you on ?
coke ?
grass ?
where' s the stash ?
down the toilet ?
you don' t deserve any help you' re a comic book version , sergeant .
you look better in your mugshot , you know .
the great theresa .
the master medium .
yeah , for you it' s all in the book your book of ... what' s it again ?
enoch .
yeah , enoch .
according to you this poor girl is dead because of a book that was written 4000 years ago .
correct ?
that' s right .
i' d find such an unusual paradox of tremendous appeal terribly stimulating if i were a sleuth .
the explanation in every detail of a crime before it' s been committed .
lady , you' re either on grass or you' re pulling my leg .
no ... the problem is in your mind .
it can' t accept the truth , but i' il help you just same .
in the book of enoch the killer is ... sergeant ... come here and look
who' s playing games here ?
come out of the floor , out of nowhere .
who lives downstairs ?
it' s vacant , has been for 26 years .
but how the heck did ... ?
don' t you start acting up too .
it' s only a prank and i' il find out what' s behind it even if i have to tear the whole building apart .
keep refusing the truth .
at this very precise moment , in some other distant town , horrendously awful things are happening .
things that would shatter your imagination .
hi officer .
i' m looking for sergeant clay .
and who are you ?
i' m peter .
you see , i' m with the ...
don' t tell me you' re a newspaper reporter , right ?
i can smell you guys a mile away .
you' re right , i' m a journalist .
look , there' s a rumor down a the station house that someone kind of died mysteriously and i wanna talk to the sergeant about it .
it' s not going to be any mystery how the next guy dies if i let any unauthorized people in that house .
look ... isn' t there a way that maybe you and i could come to a sort of gentleman' s agreement ?
you' re talking into deaf ear , pal .
now take my advice and beat it before the sergeant comes out .
ok , i' il take your advice .
it' s like we' re in the wrong season suddenly .
damn dusty all these high winds , pretty unusual .
by the way , i hear cindy heran never went home last night .
so ?
it sure wouldn' t be the first time .
i remember once she was sitting in ...
you know something ?
ever since father thomas hanged himself dunwich ain' t been the same .
kind of scary a few beers and you fellas start seeing ghouls and devils all over the place .
well , you saw what happened , didn' t you ?
sure , but that doesn' t mean that there isn' t any explanation .
it could have been a truck passing by the vibration anyway , i' ve lost my mirror .
you forget who our ancestors were ?
no .
i' ve forgot how many beers you have drunk .
so let' s have another .
house buys .
i' ve gotta go but wait , what about ...
see you me too wait up , mike .
i' il see you around wait , guys ... guys ...
brand new building ... new construction .
i tell you ,
more garbage like this ... i' m gonna loose all of my customers .
the language is scary , i admit it .
but the overall message couldn' t have been more puritanical .
then why did you choose the topic of incest ?
when i was 8 years old i wanted to marry my father .
i guess all girls that age want to marry their fathers .
anyway , i got over it pretty quickly he was a drunk .
one day he just picked up and left my mother and me .
did this leave any particular emotional feeling in you at the time ?
emptiness .
that and pity for my mother .
i began to hate all men and i ... excuse me jerry .
hi , sandra .
how are you ?
hello emily .
how come so early ?
i mean i thought we made it for eight .
that' s the trouble .
i can' t make it tonight .
i have to see bob .
bob ?
you' re not upset are you ?
no , i' m not upset .
maybe a little worried perhaps .
you' ve been seeing an awful lot of him , haven' t you , lately ?
poor bob .
he' s a sick and ionely kid .
i don' t see why people hate him so .
his mother was what you call a woman of easy virtue .
no husband .
no morals .
here in dunwich , anybody like that is also branded a witch .
look sandra .
i don' t believe those idiots who tell me that our ancestors were salem witch burners alright ?
okay , okay jerry , i' m sorry .
don' t worry i' il see you tomorrow .
around 9 ?
sure thing .
bye .
so long sandra .
bye bye and take it easy .
jerry , bye .
bye
okay sandra , where were we ?
on the same old problem , men .
why do they have to make life so difficult ?
sandra sandra ... did he hurt you ?
did he claw you ?
he must have been frightened .
strange .
it' s the first time he ever acted up like that .
he loves to have you pet him .
he always comes to you when you' re here .
something must have frightened him .
... give me the dirtiest thoughts ... i' m telling you , you' re gonna end up a dirty old man .
a pervert .
peeping tom .
talk about box lunches man saw a porno flick once , where this guy got so carried away he humped himself to death .
too much of good thing but what a way to go
what' s the matter ?
never seen a body in the earth before ?
any law against looking ?
yeah okay , i' m leaving .
what time you got ?
let' s flip to see who goes in the hole alright .
call it .
heads .
tails .
in the hole , sucker .
shit ...
what are you still doing here , pal ?
come on fellas .
what do you want from us ?
nothing i' m just curious about this girl here , that' s all .
look , why don' t you guys go ahead with your work and just pretend i' m not around .
well move , cause we' re almost finished .
it' s 5 o' clock .
we' ve busted our balls enough , let' s go .
you' re not going to leave her like that , are you ?
union hours .
anyway , what does she care ?
she' s not in any hurry .
is she ?
oh , my god ...
but for you , mary would have suffered a terrible death .
i was just lucky .
no it was written .
are you acquainted with the book of enoch ?
a text which dates back to more than 4000 years ago .
it contains man' s first recorded description of his boundless mortal fear in the face of malice itself the demanding implacable enemy who' s search for blood is never satiated .
mary , tell your experience .
everything you' ve witnessed during our last seance .
the city of the dead ... the living dead .
a cursed city where the gates of hell have been opened .
where exactly is this city ?
i don' t know where it is .
all i know is that it is called dunwich .
i' ve never heard of it .
how do you know ?
i mean how can you be so sure ?
i read the name on a tombstone mr .
bell , if those gates are left open it may be the end of humanity .
we gotta try to get them shut again .
at midnight on monday we go into all saints day .
the night of the dead begins then .
and if the portals of hell don' t get shut before then , no dead body will ever be able to rest in peace again .
and so the dead will rise up and take over the earth .
you' ve got to get to dunwich .
you must re close those gates
bob ?
bob , are you here ?
bob ?
bob ?
bob ... ?
bob bob ... what happened ?
did you hurt yourself ?
bob bob ... bob bob ... don' t leave me alone i' m afraid ...
hello ?
it' s you , mr .
robbins .
no , emily' s not here , i' m afraid .
what' s that ?
she' s usually home this hour of the night .
i hope that nothing' s happened to her .
there' s been a lot of strange talk circulating .
come on now mr .
robbins .
ignore it .
people here in this town thrive on that stuff .
you should know it by now .
she' il be home in another couple of minutes .
if you need me for any reason though , feel free to call .
i should be at the studio for at least another hour or so , okay ?
goodbye mr .
robbins .
goodbye
no , no ... come on tommy , please .
no please , tommy what the devil' s the matter honey ?
you treat me like i was a stranger .
what have i done ?
tell me .
how come you picked out here to park ?
this place gives me the willies .
oh , rose .
come on .
you' re not a little child now .
you don' t really believe in that stupid salem witch stuff , do you ?
of course not .
now what' s wrong ?
sorry tommy , but ... but i keep thinking that someone' s out there spying on us .
come on .
there isn' t anyone out there watch .
i' il turn on the headlights .
you know this dunwich it' s not even on the map .
so , you don' t believe me , do you ?
that' s not the point .
it' s just going to be harder to find , that' s all .
we don' t even know where to start , do we ?
you know i get my inner visions too .
you know .
just let me meditate over a bottle of scotch ... and ?
and i' il take you anywhere .
well , she certainly wasn' t strangled .
doesn' t seem to have been any kind of physical abuse .
what was the cause of her death then ?
some kind of cardiac arrest .
only that expression on her face looks like pure fear
like something scared her to death .
scared her ?
excuse me , mr .
robbins do you know if your daughter had a heart condition ?
no ... oh god ... well , what' s our procedure ?
sit tight .
everything depends on the autopsy .
i' il sit tight you' il get your order after that from the d . a .
okay , but let me hear from you , joe what' s your opinion , jerry ?
what' s there to say .
i' m at a total loss .
it was bob ... that pervert ?
you can bet on it they should have put him away for life after what he tried to do with poor little anne ross
listen , i' il call all three cars out after that boy and i wouldn' t be surprised if he could tell us what happened to rosy kellman and frank' s kid , too sheriff russell ... sheriff what the dickens is this ?
good lord ... that kid is gonna fry ... mark my word .
so , your newspaper editor wouldn' t believe you ?
listen .
when adrian deniro told me about 2 years ago that i' d meet a girl who would be buried alive , i didn' t believe him either .
i mean , i laughed right in his face .
deniro was aware of many things .
he knew all about the city of the dead .
okay , okay .
say i believe you .
did you see ... when you were in this trance did you see anything besides that tombstone ?
oh yes .
i saw a priest
who by hanging himself opened the gates of hell .
he must be destroyed ...
... amen .
the lord is my shepherd ... this way please .
where is she ?
where is my emily ?
she' s in heaven now , mrs .
robbins
mrs .
holden ?
yes .
mrs. holden died last night and according to dr .
thompson , was frightened to death .
frightened to death ?
that' s what she said , fear .
of what ?
damned if i know , doc .
it' s the strangest thing i' ve ever heard of .
fear ?
there' s been talk that rose calvin and tommy fisher disappeared too .
they went to the movies last night and nobody has seen them since .
that makes five people that have disappeared in the last 48 hours .
i think it' s bob .
i don' t believe in this superstitious nonsense .
yeah , maybe you' re right sure , remember two years ago when bob took little anne into the woods ?
it was a miracle we found him in time .
yeah , and i say it' s him he' s the one causing all the trouble around here .
god only knows what he did to poor emily .
all i know is that the air in dunwich is getting awful thick ... soon as i can find somebody to buy my shop and my house i' m vamoosing .
you can bet your ass .
calm down , dear .
take it easy .
calm down .
my baby , my poor baby you better take john john out .
yes , of course .
john john come on .
let' s go outside .
let' s take a walk .
you have to be strong now .
you have to find courage to face reality .
you have to be a man .
do you know what i mean ?
i' m hungry good .
there' s a lollipop in the glove box
look .
i' m not joking .
i' m starved .
look , you' re the one who got me out here in the armpit of the world chasing your galloping cadavers .
come on .
let' s go have a snack someplace okay .
you want to give up ?
why don' t you get in the car we' il go and check out the local cuisine .
don' t be upset .
upset ?
who' s upset ?
according to your theory we have less than 48 hours before this ... aii saints day .
oh please .
not now .
do you mind ?
come on .
let' s go check out the local cuisine
mommy ... daddy ... mommy ... daddy ... mommy ... what' s the matter , honey ?
emily is back .
i saw her looking in the window .
she wanted to catch me .
emily went away forever , john john she' s in heaven .
i saw her ... i swear , i saw her i really did you better call the doctor .
i' m alright ... i don' t need a doctor .
i don' t want a doctor ... i saw her you had a big day .
you' re upset .
we all are .
off you go now .
go to bed .
i don' t wanna go , mommy i' m scared ... emily' s gonna get me i know it ...
hello ?
it' s me , sandra .
you have to come right away .
no , there' s no time to explain .
you wouldn' t believe me anyway .
just come , please i' m having a nervous breakdown ... yes , okay .
sandra , just calm down and control yourself .
what is it ?
there' s only two possibilities .
either i' m going out of my mind or something very very strange is happening .
look , take it easy .
i' il be there in 10 minutes , honey .
bye .
jerry , is that you ?
yeah , it' s me .
come in ... come in
what do you need that for ?
i don' t know , maybe a crucifix would be better .
a crucifix ?
what the hell are you talking about ?
tell me the truth .
do you consider me a basket case ?
no , not at all .
why ?
your nurturing a pet neurosis , that' s all .
like about 70 % of the female population in this country .
so according to you i' m not stark raving mad , at a least not yet .
don' t be silly .
of course not .
sometimes you may drink a little more than you should , but that' s no reason to be taken away and put into a looney house .
no , i' d rather not right now and you really shouldn' t either .
alright .
you better see for yourself .
it' s in the kitchen .
the kitchen ?
oh , christ
was i just imagining things ?
it can' t be ... it' s her .
mrs. holden .
this morning she was inside a coffin at the funeral home and now she' s here in my kitchen .
how ?
how did she get here ?
i don' t know .
i heard a noise .
i came to look and there she was on my floor .
i called you right after .
i thought i was loosing my mind .
okay .
let' s use our heads and not panic .
calm down .
we' ve gotta find out how she got here , alright ?
i couldn' t give a damn how she got here .
i just want her gone .
let' s get her out of here .
i can' t take the sight of her .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
at this point , a good stiff drink is the only medicine what are you gonna do ?
i don' t believe in the twilight zone so i guess i' il call the the sheriff on this matter .
and what do you tell him ?
i' il tell him exactly what you told me .
that you heard this noise .
that you came running and that you saw her there , and the rest is up to them .
what was that ?
the door is closed but we left it wide open .
someone took her away .
or maybe she just left .
don' t be ridiculous bodies don' t just get up and walk away by themselves .
she' s still here she' s still in the house ... sandra ... sandra ... get a hold of yourself i don' t want to stay here anymore jerry get her out calm down ...
please ... tell her to go ... she' s in here you hear her .
jerry , she' s in here , i can' t take it anymore .
sandra sandra , calm down .
don' t let imagination run away with you .
i don' t know what the hell is going on here either , so were going to take it step by step and search every room in the house , alright ?
and we' il find the reason , alright sandra ?
and you' re going to follow me .
follow me now come on , that' s it .
alright ?
alright .
i' il do whatever you say .
i don' t think i' il manage to sleep here tonight .
if you want to stay at my studio or my house you' re always welcome .
good god ... it' s blood ... blood ...
dunwich ?
yes .
yes .
i know it .
odd that you' re looking for dunwich .
yes , as a matter of fact ... yes , that' s the town where father thomas ... terrible ... terrible you know that dunwich was built on the ruins of the original salem .
that village of witches and heresy .
and evil ... yes , but can you tell us how to get there ?
it' s not easy .
you' il have to go back towards the highway and as you approach it there' s a road going left blocked by a landslide .
that will take you to dunwich .
thanks a lot .
just out of curiousity ... why are you folks going down there ?
we' re just looking up a friend .
i see .
thanks again .
good lord , help us .
bob ... hi ann .
what are you doing in the back seat of my dad' s car ?
i didn' t know where to sleep .
you won' t tell anyone will you ?
no , of course not .
although you get some awfully weird ideas .
come on , smoke only then you better split , okay ?
ann ... it' s him go on ... get out of here what are you doing ?
get in the house ... i can explain everything , mr .
ross shut up you bastard ...
what were you trying to do with my daughter ?
please , let me explain , mr .
ross .
i was only looking for a place to sleep .
i swear
pervert ... murderer ...
i guess there' s nobody in .
that' s strange .
what do you plan on doing ?
i have a feeling this is where the answer is .
we' ve gotta find the undertaker or someone from the funeral parlor .
maybe they have gone to the cemetery .
you go .
i' il wait in your office .
i don' t think i can take a cemetery right now .
fair enough .
dweller of the twilight void ...
well ?
yes ... that' s it that' s the very same tombstone that i saw in my trance .
great .
welcome to the city of the dead .
now what do we do ?
we must find the priest' s grave and uncover him .
there isn' t much time left .
all saints day begins at midnight .
where do we start ?
okay ... it' s gonna be one of these .
good thing he didn' t hang himself in arlington .
yes ?
excuse me .
i wonder if you could give us some information .

well , we' re looking for a tombstone of ... of a priest who hanged himself .
father thomas ?
we don' t know his name .
well , why are you looking for his burial site ?
it' s a long story .
one you might not want to believe .

i' m just about ready to believe anything at this point .
that' s the whole story .
my god in heaven ... the living dead .
and that' s why you' re here in dunwich ?
what do you wanna do ?
what are you hoping to accomplish ?
the death of father thomas gave birth to some ... some evil .
