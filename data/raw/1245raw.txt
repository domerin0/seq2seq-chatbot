i' ve got to take her to ' em . i' ve got to take her to ann' s parents .
all right , you go .
leave baby alice with them . i' il get to work , and i' il meet you later at the ten bells .
mostlyjews live here .
notice something , inspector ?
i paid . i already paid . i' m not after you , emperor .
where is he ?
move it !
hey !
get up .
get up !
hello , darling .
sergeant .
it' s night .
well spotted , inspector abberline . indeed , it is night .
the genius has returned to us .
thank you , gentlemen , and remember ... if you ever wish to escape the dreary confines of your present duties ... this never happened .
cut along , now .
have i lost a day ?
no , inspector . indeed , it' s only four hours since you left here .
oh , deepest apologies for the , uh , rude awakening . i suspect you enjoyed that . i must be cruel only to be kind , as the poet said .
although i would happily wallop you every time you chased the dragon .
well , i had a sneaking suspicion you might interrupt .
you' ve seen something .
what did you see ?
are her petticoats saturated with blood ?
you know , they used to burn men like you alive .
sometime this evening a bang tail was murdered in george yard .
that doesn' t sound much out of the ordinary . it was the way she was done , inspector . it was the way the bang tail was done ... that cries out for a man of your talents .
her name was martha tabram . i don' t know what sort of name tabram is .
it sounds foreign to me .
this is not what i saw .
not the woman of your dreams ?
you sure ?
yeah .
show him .
you show him .
why do i have to be exposed to this degradation over and over again ?
i' ve looked at the mess twice !
before he cut her throat , he removed her livelihood ... as a keepsake .
gentlemen , we are indeed fortunate today ... to be able to observe an entirely new approach ... to the treatment of insanity . it is oh , dr. ferral . i was just saying , we' re here in the hope that you will permit us ... to observe this new treatment of yours .
well , i wasn' t expecting such distinguished visitors , sir william .
but you' re all welcome , of course . i' m ready to begin right now .
who is your patient ?
ann crook .
an unfortunate , sir william ... who' s hysterical and violent ... and has severe delusions of persecution .
oh , poor girl .
uh , do please proceed , dr. ferral .
gentlemen .
we have one tap above ...
and one into the left lobe ...
and ... one on the right ... and this unlucky patient' s dementia ... will no longer take a violent form .
thanks to this simple procedure ... we can now permanently alleviate the poor girl' s suffering .
what could i do ? i had to leave the baby with ann' s parents .
rich man .
thought he was gonna take care of ann .
knew that was too bloody good to be true .
they' re gonna kill every one of us .
who is this albert , anyway ?
who is he ?
oh , for god' s sake , who cares about albert and ann' s troubles ?
what are we gonna do ?
we can' t stay clear of the nichols boys forever .
you know , they say they held poor martha down ... and watched her bleed until she passed out , and then cut her throat .
oh !
shocking .
mcqueen is mad .
he enjoys hurting women .
that' s insane .
they want four pounds .
how we gonna get four pounds ?
not with my old cunny . i' d be lucky to get four pence .
oi , oi , oi !
behave yourselves or bugger off ! .
yeah , you can bugger off .
we work , girls .
we work the streets harder than ever .
right ?
right ?
all right , we can do it here .
but hurry up .
the bobbies are fussing us tonight .
all right .
gotta get the old man off first , right ?
give it here . i' il put it in meself .
oh , that' s ni
ooh !
eh ?
yeah , yeah . is it in ?
of course it is .
come on .
no , it' s not .
you got it stuck between your bleedin ' legs .
no , i haven' t .
come on , get a move on . i knows it when i feels it .
oh !
that' s mine , polly .
that' s my money .
i could pop your eye out .
customers wouldn' t mind .
they don' t mind if a whore can' t see .
what' s that ?
what have i got here ?
what have i got here , constable ?
only a little thing .
only a little thing to you , but a great thing to me .
move , or i' il bash that smart mouth .
you' re a dead woman .
he won' t bother you again tonight .
yeah , that' s right .
look , one for the nichols .
yeah ?
and one for me .
right ?
oh .
come here .
come here .
hey .
shh .
hey , we work the streets together . i' il keep my eye on you , love , eh ?
oh , you pig !
you disgusting pig !
yeah , i' m a pig . i' m what' s wrong with the world .
be on your own , then .
oh , no !
you don' t want the company of a pig !
what the fuck are you lookin ' at ?
i slept with you !
thirsty ?
mmm .
that was the thing that was in my dream .
what' s it called again ?
cleopatra' s needle .
mmm .
cleopatra .
she was a beauty , wasn' t she ? it was carved 1, 500 years before the son of god was born .
mmm .
six men died to bring it here ... from egypt .
may the good lord have mercy .
she was like that when i found her all murdered .
what kind of monster did this ?
woman , i told you .
who was the first to see her ?
you go in .
keep to the streets .
settle back , now .
the boys have made their rounds of the taverns and the delightful domiciles ... that make up this charming little street .
would it surprise you to learn that nobody heard a sound ?
throat was cut , but there' s no arterial spray on the wall .
she was killed somewhere else .
it rained last night , didn' t it ?
mm hmm .
she' s dry .
she was brought here in a carriage or something .
throat must have been cut in the carriage . i imagine they stopped it just over there .
they " ?
they " ?
there' s more than one , then .
most definitely .
this was all in your vision ?
take your missus home .
where were the coppers last night ?
oh, jesus .
so ... definitely more than one person .
has to be a message from the nichols boys .
am i right ?
what the hell ?
that' s grapes , isn' t it ?
what the hell would a bang tail be doing with grapes ?
i' d like to give them an answer .
what are you talking about ?
the nichols boys . i would welcome the opportunity ... to give them an answer to their bloody message .
there is most definitely a message here .
you' re right about that .
and what am i wrong about ?
martha tabram was raped , tortured and killed .
that' s cruel .
but i' ve seen that sort of cruelty in the east end before .
this is methodical .
the butchery' s irrational ... yet meticulous and deliberate .
altogether a different breed of killer .
as soon as possible i' d like to know what he took .
what ?
what do you mean , what he took ?
didn' t you notice ?
what ?
he' s taken at least one of her organs .
oh , no .
i want every veterinarian , butcher ... and furrier in the district interviewed .
furrier ?
what did he do , sir ?
skin her ?
pipe down , withers .
when the inspector is talking , you are listening .
do you understand ?
yes , sergeant .
he disemboweled her .
after he cut her throat , he stabbed her in the chest ... cut open her stomach ... and , uh , took out her intestines .
at least one of her organs was removed . i' m waiting for the police surgeon' s report for more details .
i see .
well , one thing' s for certain : an englishman didn' t do it .
maybe one of these red indians ... wandered into whitechapel and indulged his natural inclinations .
with all due respect , sir ... i believe this was done by someone ... with at least a working knowledge of dissection .
an educated man , such as a doctor  an educated man ?
that' s preposterous .
no well bred man would do this .
probably a tradesman or a butcher .
a tradesman is a possibility , sir , yes .
but there' s a strong indication against it .
there was a sprig of grapes found under her body .
what are you driving at ?
no one in whitechapel , no matter what their trade ... could afford grapes .
obviously they were given to her by the killer .
and it follows that he must be someone with money .
what about thejews ?
ajew butcher .
or a jew tailor might have money .
there are plenty of them in whitechapel .
well , sir , for the sake of public safety in general ... i' d like to be careful about spreading the rumors that it might be a jew .
inspector , i know your reputation ... for making brilliant guesses that turn out to be right .
someone told me you claimed to dream the answers .
frankly , it doesn' t matter to me what your methods are .
but be certain you don' t proceed without proof . is that clear ?
of course , sir .
personally , i don' t care .
the fewer pinch pricks on the streets , the better .
but the sooner you find this butcher or tailor , inspector ... the sooner we can all celebrate your promotion .
keep me informed .
he didn' t know nothin ' !
bloodyjew did it ! it' s gotta be !
murdering kikes !
every cellar !
every stable !
we' il find him out !
some bleedin' jew !
come on !
that' s enough !
let' s burn ' em out !
upbeat ]
i have wonderful news .
tell me .
surely you , of all people , can guess . i don' t want to guess with you .
dr. marbury says ...
dr. marbury says ?
dr. marbury says i' m going to have your child .
aye , to die ... and go we know not where ... but to lie in cold obstruction and to rot .
a simple " rest in peace " would suffice , godley .
yes , sir . in the midst of life we are in death .
of whom may we seek for succor but of thee , o lord ... who , for our sins , are justly displeased ?
yet , o lord , god most holy , o lord most mighty
good afternoon , ladies . i' m inspector abberline .
this is sergeant godley .
we' re investigating the murders of polly nichols and martha tabram .
yes , we understand that they were both friends of you ladies .
close friends .
we' re rather hoping you' d be able to help us out .
don' t know nothing .
me neither .
why you botherin ' us ?
you ought to be botherin ' mcqueen . is he the boss on nichol street ?
he' s the heart and soul of the gang . isn' t it your job to be knowin ' that small detail ?
and what makes you think mcqueen did this to your friends ?
can' t prove nothing by me .
you' re mary kelly . is that right ?
that' s right .
well , mary kelly , unless one of you is willing to testify against mcqueen ... i can' t do nothing .
surely , inspector ... a strong , handsome man like you ... you could do anything you put your brilliant mind to .
i' m a coward and a weakling and i can' t help meself .
what' s your excuse ?
why are you so bloody useless ?
come on , mary .
that won' t help us .
is that you ?
before my mother died , back in ireland . is that when you came here ?
yeah .
when i was eight .
when things was good .
we were starvin ' , but we were starvin ' in fresh air .
i was thinking ... we ain' t ever gonna earn enough to satisfy the nichols boys ... and feed our own mouths .
you said , right you said those men , yeah ?
the ones who took her rich artist man and who took her as well .
you said they was clean shaven and their clothes was neat .
yeah , right .
well , they weren' t no criminals then . i mean , they weren' t the likes of the nichols boys .
they was unusual .
perhaps even official .
what are you gettin ' at , annie ?
maybe we could go with the papers .
get paid for the story , you know .
where is ann crook ?
that sort of thing .
the papers are always desperate for things bad about the government .
and it' s a mystery to boot . it' s not a bad plan .
what do you think , mary ? i' m thinkin ' we should talk to that inspector , the one at polly' s funeral .
oh , fuck me , no ! if we go to the papers they might hurt ann or do something to her baby .
what , worse than what' il happen to her in whitechapel when she sprouts teats ? i don' t know for sure , but i think we' re better off talkin' to that inspector .
lord , you are young after all .
four bitches .
that' s what i thought .
you only paid for one bloody person .
they' re my guests .
guests ?
well , let me welcome your guests .
go on , get out !
go on , get out !
get out of here , you bloody whores !
go on !
when you have four pence ... you can come back with your ladies in waitin ' , your grace .
oh , shut up !
ow !
back to work , then .
well , let' s try and stay together .
you know we can' t .
then stay good and clear of nichol street .
come on !
all right , annie ?
ehh .
bloody bastard .
how' s your head ?
oh , very funny !
hyah !
boo !
i didn' t frighten you , did i ?
i been lookin' for ya . i been lookin ' all over for ya .
you been looking for me ?
not for me .
on behalf of my gentleman .
a very fine gentleman .
he sent me to find ya .
your gentleman sent you to find me ?
oh , get off . i might be unfortunate , but i' m not a blitherin ' idiot . it' s the truth . it' s the god' s truth .
he seen ya .
he likes ya .
and he said tonight only you' il do .
so he said to find ya , take ya to hanover street ... where he' s waitin' for ya .
you' re very pretty .
go on , then , get in . i' il take you there .
oh , i almost forgot .
my gentleman got you a present .
you like grapes ?
yeah .
whoa !
your gentleman , he must be very refined .
very refined indeed .
get in . i' il take you there .
all right .
here we are .
i' m like a lady .
you are a lady .
your gaffer , does he want anything special ?
just the usual , i expect .
now , this alley takes you to a yard .
my gentleman , he' s quiet .
he doesn' t like disturbances .
what i wanna know , right ... is a toff like him , how much is he offerin ' ?
here .
two florin .
that' il do me .
let me see ya .
go on .
down here ?
yeah .
straight down .
straight down to the door at the end .
shh .
shh .
straight down there , yeah ?
oops .
no !
bugger off ! .
you watch your mouth !
any more information ?
my readers wanna know this stuff .
oh , do they ?
found a piece of leather apron in her mouth ?
no , mr. best , but if it' s your fancy ... i' d be delighted to stuff your mouth with a piece of leather .
come on , give us a tip .
put your picture on the front page .
cover up !
you' re supposed to do something about it !
this is ridiculous !
there' s a bleeding murderer on the loose !
what about my wife ?
this is annie .
yes .
another of the circle of friends .
annie chapman .
dark annie , they called her .
you still say this isn' t the nichols boys ?
did the constable show you the leather they found down by the water spout ?
could be part of a butcher' s apron .
leather apron .
dear god .
we could be looking for a butcher after all . i saw her .
this one ?
yeah .
last night .
i saw her face .
don' t trample over this area .
let us see the body !
come on , let us see !
oh , god .
there' s your typical londoner ... imbued with the christian spirit of sympathy for his fellow man .
or fellow whore , in this case .
he' s really outdone himself this time , hasn' t he ?
he not only severed the intestines ... he carefully arranged them around the neck and shoulders . i think he' s taken more organs this time .
grapes again .
why grapes ?
only polly and dark annie were given grapes .
only they were disemboweled in such a meticulous fashion .
this ain' t killing for profit .
this is ritual .
yeah , but why grapes ?
so they' il trust whatever he offers .
i' ve never fully understood that tradition .
they' re for the ferryman ... who takes the body across the river into the land of the dead . if she don' t have the money to pay him ... she' d have to wander forever , lost between the two worlds .
i need to consult a doctor .
are you ill , inspector ?
a surgeon , to be specific .
the killer removed the victim' s uterus and its attachments .
my god .
he' s out of his mind .
that' s very astute of you , sir . i don' t appreciate sarcasm , inspector . i' m sorry , sir . i meant nothing by it .
you already have a surgeon at your disposal . i need a man with a strong stomach and a sober mind .
the police surgeon has neither .
no .
request denied .
why ?
are you questioning my decision ?
no , sir . i simply want to know why .
there' s already too much nonsense and gossip in the press .
you start consulting doctors ... and all sorts of wild notions will be printed .
no one else is to see the bodies .
it is my honor ... to present this ... unique medical phenomenon .
until last week , mr. joseph merrick [ man whispers ]
john merrick . i beg your pardon .
mr. john merrick ... was an attraction at a sideshow .
now he' s being cared for ... at england' s leading hospital ... and with your generosity ... we will be able to continue to do so .
ladies and gentlemen ...
mr. john merrick .
turn around .
oh , please . i can' t stand it .
oh !
he should have been killed at birth !
good health !
that' il be the last one , your royal highness .
these hands are a gift from god .
the psychotic patient is  pardon , sir .
you dr. ferral ? i am , yes . i' m inspector abberline , assigned to whitechapel .
my lord , you' re the ripper case .
am i right ?
yeah .
jolly good .
you' ve come to the perfect place .
we' ve got butchers aplenty here .
i see . i could use the expertise of someone like yourself to help solve this case .
they tell me you' re the best young surgeon in london .
really ? i don' t see how a reputable surgeon could know anything about it .
this country' s overrun with foreigners .
orientals and ...
jews .
socialists trying to stir things up against our monarchy .
that' s who you should be pursuing .
don' t you think ?
excuse me .
you don' t belong here , do you ?
i' m afraid dr. ferral suffers from the surgeon' s malady .
and what' s that , sir ?
want of feeling .
he knows everything about anatomy ... and nothing about the soul .
how may i assist you , inspector ?
well , forgive my ignorance , sir , but , um ... are you a surgeon ? i was .
unfortunately , i suffered a brain seizure six months ago .
sorry to hear that , sir .
these days i limit myself to teaching .
so you see , i' m accustomed to answering questions , inspector .
well , sir ... could you tell me what sort of a knife , uh , would this be ?
i think you mean to draw a liston knife . it' s named for liston , who was a surgeon in the crimean war .
because there was no anesthetic on the battlefield ... he had to carry out these amputations very quickly .
uh ... do you , by any chance , have the police surgeon' s report available ?
yes , i do , sir .
may i ?
we must keep this confidential .
of course .
there it is .
thank you .
hmm .
yes .
wouldn' t someone have heard their screams ?
not if you cut their throats first .
yes .
and how can you be sure they wouldn' t react to seeing the liston knife ?
grapes .
he offers them grapes first .
ah .
grapes are very tempting .
yes , of course .
they' d gobble them up , wouldn' t they ?
and he might offer them a drink to ease them down .
a drink laced with laudanum .
how do you know that ? i found a sprig of grapes on both victims ' bodies ... and i smelled the laudanum on their lips .
laudanum is a derivative of opium .
apart from doctors and addicts , not many would recognize it .
how long have you chased the dragon , inspector ?
well , these should help with the headaches .
and , um ... opium leeches minerals out of the body ... so i' ve also given you a tonic ... that will help to restore your appetite .
thank you very much , sir .
i' m a fool . i don' t think you' re a fool .
far from it . i ought to have known , sir , that you' re physician ordinary to the royal family .
well , yes , it' s certainly an honor ... but it' s an honor bestowed on many doctors .
he cut their throats from left to right , therefore he' s right handed .
excuse me .
he had to slice through four layers of tissue ... and up to an inch of subcutaneous fat .
after that ... he entered the abdominal cavity ... so he would have had to use more than just merely the liston knife .
perhaps he was carrying a portable amputation kit similar to this .
what do you think ?
is it possible , sir , that the killer is an educated man ... perhaps someone who studied medicine ... but who is , in fact , not a surgeon himself ?
the intestines are simple enough .
but , uh , the uterus ?
the liver , especially .
hard to locate , unless you know what you' re doing .
and he was working quickly , in the dark . i had held out hope that this ... monster was a veterinarian ... or a furrier or an ... [ chuckles ]
especially well educated butcher .
no , i must admit , if i were you ... i' d look for someone with a thorough knowledge of human anatomy .
damn him .
do you want me to suck it ? i can suck the thames dry .
don' t be frightened , dearie .
how far advanced is our grandson' s malady ?
uh , no lesions have appeared , ma' am .
there is some neural damage a slight trembling of the right hand .
but i' m hopeful more than hopeful that treatment will arrest the disease .
he seems to us to be suffering greatly in his mind . is the disease affecting his emotions ?
yes , well , of course his mood is depressed ... because of the news of the diagnosis .
but that should improve as he regains his strength .
you are a true physician , sir william . in all ways , you attend to the health of our empire .
we are grateful .
thank you , ma' am .
if this is the beginning ... of a five pointed star
a bloodyjewish star .
withers ! inspector is talking , which means you are what ? i' m listening , sir .
yes .
this area would form a likely point . i want double shifts within these streets until further notice .
and don' t only worry about jews and butchers .
you stop anyone suspicious ... including well dressed gentlemen .
and by the way , withers ... the star of david has six points .
right .
once more into the breach , dear friends .
dismissed !
why have you called me here ?
it' s just it' s just you say three more have to be killed .
i can' t take it , sir . it' s everywhere . it' s in all the papers .
i' m just a simple chap , sir . i' m not a great man like you .
i just don' t know where i am at ... anymore .
there , there , netley . i shall tell you where we are .
we are in the most extreme and utter region ... of the human mind .
a radiant abyss ... where men meet themselves . i don' t understand that . i don' t understand , sir .
hell , netley .
we are in hell .
let me go !
get your hands off me !
pull yourself together .
go on ! in with you !
sorry about that , inspector .
she' s madly in love with me ... although she hides it well .
you said mcqueen killed your two friends .
so what are you doing here ?
oh , i see .
women are butchered right and left , and you can' t do piss about it .
and i' m the fool .
we' re watching them .
can' t arrest them without evidence , so we watch them .
what else can we do ? i' il testify . if you keep meself and me friends alive , i' il testify .
to what , precisely ?
that mcqueen said he' d cut me unless i pay him a pound a week .
no .
what you mean , no ?
you asked me to testify .
are you worried i' il let you down ? i won' t . i promise i won' t .
you testify against mcqueen , maybe he goes in for a year or two .
but his boys , they' il take their revenge on you and your friends . i can' t let you do it .
it' s your round this time .
i confess , i have an appetite .
one day , i' il be a great big round woman ... with a skinny little man for a husband .
and a dozen plump children , i imagine .
you think that' s funny an unfortunate like me being a decent mother ?
no , no , i didn' t mean that . i didn' t mean that at all .
you' il be a wonderful mother someday , mary .
honest . i can see it . i see you in a little cottage by the sea ... surrounded by children . i can see it , mary , clear as day .
i really do have visions , you know .
are you serious ?
sergeant godley calls ' em my intuitions .
as a matter of fact ... i had one about you in this case .
you have visions about me ?
what might those be ?
i want you to think carefully .
besides mcqueen , besides these awful murders ... has anything else happened to you or perhaps to one of your friends ... that' s a bit out of the ordinary ?
ben kidney ?
that' s special branch she' s describing , you know .
what the hell would ben kidney and special branch be doing in whitechapel ?
wait a minute .
she' s irish born , isn' t she ?
there' s your answer .
a secret irish rebel .
that' s why they would be after her , right ?
they were after ann crook ... who was having an affair with a wealthy gentleman .
a man she bore a child .
a child that' s now missing , along with its grandparents .
right .
drive on , please , driver .
you do not fuck with special branch .
they fuck with you .
i don' t know what you' re thinking , and i don' t care to know .
inspector adderly .
mr. kidney wants to see me .
mr. kidney' s gone , sir .
didn' t say where .
could be for the night .
no .
he said he' d be back before 1 1 : 00 , and i should wait .
where are you going , sir ?
he said i should wait in his office .
and what floor is mr. kidney' s office on ?
i don' t know what floor , you bloody idiot ... because i haven' t been to his fucking office yet , have i ?
he told me to have the desk man let me up .
but i' m more than happy to stand here like a knob ... because you disobeyed ben kidney' s order . it' s the second floor on the right .
thanks .
free ireland !
free ireland !
get inside , sir !
just some gunpowder , sir .
that' s all .
little more than a firework .
anyone go in or out ?
yes , sir . i' m sorry , sir .
yes , uh
there' s an inspector adderly in your office .
no , there' s nothing missing here .
the bastards have been in here , sir . i can smell ' em .
no .
yes .
no , not together .
too suspicious .
you wait for me , and if she' s in there you can go and visit her on your own . i' m going with you right now ... or i' m going to the newspapers .
i mean it .
there' s a number of mental disorders for which it is necessary ... to remove the front part of the brain .
her records indicate that she was violent ... threatening to do harm to herself ... and others .
does she have any relations ?
no , she' s a ward of the state .
that' s a lie .
listen to me .
you' re under arrest .
you' re here to assist my investigation .
keep your mouth shut . is that clear ?
sorry , sir .
good .
what else do you know about her ?
all we know is that she was an unfortunate ... who lived in the whitechapel district . i' d like to ask her a few questions .
you won' t get any sense out of her .
i' m used to that .
hello , ann . i brought mary kelly .
do you remember mary kelly ?
ann , you know me . i' m your best friend in all the world .
go away .
go away .
go away .
ann , i' m gonna find baby alice . i' m gonna take care of her .
alice is laughing to me .
laughing to me .
laughing to me all day long . it' s all right . it' s all right , darling .
what about her father ?
have you seen alice' s father , ann ?
he' s a prince .
a prince .
a prince !
a prince !
and i' m a queen . i' m a queen ! i' m a queen !
how do you know he was a painter ?
he hired us to pose as artist models .
and what exactly does that entail ?
artist models .
we stood very still so he could paint us .
what' s the matter ?
you think i was born a whore ?
oh , i' m sorry . i' m an unfortunate , not a whore .
england doesn' t have whores .
just a great mass of very unlucky women .
so , ann crook ... and the painter became lovers is that it ?
he married her ... in a lovely catholic church saint savior' s . i was a witness , as a matter of fact .
he married her in a catholic church .
what do you think they' ve done to baby alice ?
special branch dumped her in bishopsgate ?
yeah , as an unknown .
but why ?
when i find out , i' il tell you .
take me to her .
you have to .
no , not yet . i need to know more first .
look here , i promise ... that i' il help you with baby alice , but not yet .
you gotta trust me on that , at least a little bit .
i do . i do trust you .
good .
do you have little ones , inspector ?
no .
no .
ayear ago no , two years i' m sorry , more than two years my wife , um , passed away ... giving birth to what i' m told was a son . i' m sorry .
thanks .
i wanna show you some paintings on the way out , yeah ?
are you gonna take me into the gallery ?
why not ?
come on .
did you see the look on her face ? i think she stopped breathing .
she' s a fright .
she has cold eyes . i feel like someone' s walking over my grave .
there' s one more painting i want you to see .
you know him , don' t you ?
those whom god has joined together , let no man put asunder . i pronounce ... that they be man and wife . in nomine patris , et filii , et spiritus sancti .
amen .
sir william gull , please .
sir william isn' t receiving visitors .
uh
sir william ? it' s inspector abberline . i need to speak with you , sir .
sir william is ill .
can' t receive any visitors .
i said ... you can' t go in .
have anna bring us some tea , would you , please ?
ah , well , i wish i could tell you , inspector ... that your story was fantastical .
unhappily , i cannot . i know for a fact that the prince has a taste in unfortunate women .
and i suppose it' s more than possible that ... he concocted this elaborate deception ... to have some privacy while he indulged in his secret life .
but i know one reason i have for stating ... that prince edward being jack the ripper is just incomprehensible .
what' s that , sir ?
if you repeat what i' m about to tell you , both our lives are in jeopardy . indeed , i hope for your sake that what i' m about to say ... will steer you clear of the very real danger you' re in . i think i' m well past the point of safe return , sir .
prince edward has syphilis .
not a pleasant state secret , but a vital one .
well , then that proves it . i couldn' t understand why the prince was killing ann crook' s friends ... especially so savagely , but ... he' s not merely killing them .
he' s punishing them .
he wants revenge .
don' t you see , sir ?
no , inspector , i don' t see . i' m afraid your wild speculations about the prince' s mental state ... clever though they may be ... cannot overcome the physical impossibility ... of his committing these crimes .
the disease is far enough along that ... the prince' s hands tremble uncontrollably .
he' s very weak , and the killings ofjack the ripper ... require sure hands and considerable vigor .
and have you forgotten the most telling fact ?
whatever else the prince may be ... he knows little or nothing of human anatomy .
conduct the candidate to the center of the lodge and cause him to kneel ... for the benefit of prayer .
vouchsafe thine aid , almighty father of the universe ... to this , our present convention .
who is this ?
a poor candidate in a state of darkness ... who comes of his own free will ... perfectly prepared , humbly soliciting ... to be admitted into the mysteries and privileges . in all cases of danger and distress ... in whom do you put your trust ? in god .
how did he find out about the unfortunate and her child ?
well , he has that kind of cleverness ... you' il sometimes find in the middle classes .
a cheap sort of intelligence , but effective nevertheless .
hmm .
thank god that' s not something you' re burdened by .
yes , thank god .
recite the solemn oath .
never to reveal our secrets ... under no less a penalty than ... my throat be cut across ... my tongue be torn out by its root ... and that i be buried in sand ... a cable' s length from shore .
you don' t think gull is confiding in him , do you ?
the old fellow isn' t as far gone as all that , is he ?
no .
he' s not that foolish .
let the brother receive the light .
' another beautiful murder will be committed by me . " [ second man' s voice ]
fear me . jack the ripper .
they' re rubbish , you know that .
yes , i agree .
they' re rubbish .
though why you persist in believing that red haired jezebel , i' il never know .
have you considered that she' s the sort of woman who likes to make up stories ... particularly about men ?
she is , after all , a whore .
she' s a woman who
a rose by any other name . " is that it ?
frederick , my dear chum , no one is more delighted than i am ... that you' ve decided to resume your interest in the fairer sex ... but please remember ... a woman like that can make a man feel whatever she wants him to feel .
sergeant godley .
yes , sir .
arrest the nichol street gang .
right away , inspector . i tried to stop them , inspector .
this arrived with this afternoon' s post .
open it up ! " i send you half the kidney i took from one woman , preserved for you .
t' other piece i fried and ate . it was very nice .
we demand something be done , and done tonight . " from hell .
well , at least they got the address right . it can' t be .
are you sure he was the same ? i know him . i posed for him twice meself . i stood there naked as a babe watching him paint me for hours .
and he was with ann for what over a year ?
nearly two .
ah , here you are .
hello , girls .
where have you been ? i told you to wait for me . i can' t stay in a pub and not have a drink .
that' s cruel .
but look who i bumped into .
remember ada ?
she' s from france .
bruxelles .
bruxelles .
yes .
oh , she is pretty , isn' t she ?
not in public , love .
not in public .
would you give us a minute alone ?
we need to speak with liz .
no , ada , you stay where you are .
come , mary .
get a drinksy .
mary .
you don' t have to worry about nichol street for at least a week . i can keep ' em that long .
well , that' s something , anyway .
thank you .
yeah .
baby alice , she' s all right ?
yeah , she' s all right .
we' il get her out after this is over .
we' il get her .
listen . i want you and your friends off the streets until i can sort this thing out .
off the streets ?
for how long ?
a few days , at least .
well , you better throw us in jail then ...
' cause we have no money for food and no money for a doss .
all right .
you take this .
buy some food , get a room and stay there .
don' t tell anyone where you' re going . i don' t want to know . in three days , come to the ten bells . i' il leave a message with the barkeep .
what ? it' s not enough ? i wish i could show you the little village where i was born . it' s so lovely there . it' s by the sea , the way you said you saw me . i used to think it too small to spend a life in ... but now i' m not so sure .
don' t .
don' t .
what ?
do you think i' m paying you back ? i didn' t mean it as business . i' m still a woman .
they haven' t taken that away from me .
not yet , anyways .
enough of that .
now , lad , at least take
sorry , sir .
there , milady .
one more time .
and curtsy .
and we' re done .
oh , don' t be modest , girl .
they don' t care what we do .
i paid for your supper , remember .
stop shaking your head at me , you slag !
leave her alone .
she is my business .
she' s not yours .
liz, just be quiet for one bloody night .
no , i fucking won' t keep my voice down !
calm down !
they' il call the landlord on us .
don' t go out . it' s not safe . i need something to sustain myself . i will be right back .
liz , don' t be so fucking stupid !
do without for a night .
no . i want a fucking drink .
liz !
here we are .
service records .
grenadier guards .
lieutenant benjamin kidney .
there, just as you suspected .
before he joined special branch ...
ben kidney served in the grenadier guards .
part of his duties included assisting the field surgeon .
let me tell you something , inspector , of which i' m absolutely certain .
assisting an expert is different very , very different from doing it oneself .
think about it .
someone' s gotta clean up after the prince .
and whose job is it to take care of the widow' s messes ?
you' ve turned into othello .
do you know that ?
everything is a suspicion .
and like that tragic moor ... all your suspicions will end up in your own demise .
for heaven' s sake , man , these women aren' t just being silenced .
they' re being murdered most brutally .
why would ben kidney do that ?
to scare people .
to keep their mind off the real point .
which is ?
think what' s at stake for special branch .
prince edward married ann crook , a commoner and a catholic .
married her in a catholic church .
they had a baby .
a legitimate baby , who is , in fact , heir to the throne of england .
all these women were there .
all these women were eyewitnesses to an event ... that could rip the empire to pieces .
when she starts drinking , she' il go all night .
you know that .
but she knows how dangerous it is .
she don' t believe you about the prince .
she thinks you' re feeding that copper candies to keep him interested .
hello , sir . is anything wrong , my dear ?
no , sir .
for a moment , i thought you were someone else .
oh .
thirsty ?
always parched , sir .
perhaps there is somewhere nearby that we might go ... while my coachman keeps watch .
oh , yeah .
yeah .
this way .
follow me .
yeah , it' s this way .
follow me .
i dropped my grapes .
oh !
no !
what the fuck are you looking at , lipski ?
shut up !
shut up !
sir !
all right , george , that' s enough .
it' s one of them , isn' t it ?
throat' s cut the same way .
yeah .
he didn' t finish .
well , she' s no less dead for that .
he won' t be satisfied by this .
wilkins ?
fetch the ambulance .
go on , run along .
excuse me , miss .
you could be dead ... right now .
but then there would be too many bloody questions .
ignore the old man' s blathering .
find a scapegoat .
or next time we won' t care who asks ...
whatever happened to inspector abberline ?
we should hurry up , sir . it' s clearin ' up .
do you have a piece of chalk , netley ?
chalk , sir ?
they found another one in mitre square !
bastards !
they did another one !
i heard he cut off her nose this time .
nice work , inspector .
you' ve encouraged him to do two a night now .
out of the fucking way , cunt .
katherine eddowes .
there' s some writing on a wall just down the road there .
you should have a look at it .
the juwes' are the men that will not be blamed for nothing . " it' s hardly shakespeare , but it' il do .
i was busy with the children
madame , slow down .
slow down .
make sure you get the apron as well , yeah ?
it was written by the killer , sir .
and how do you know that ? i was here three quarters of an hour ago .
this building mostlyjews live here , is that right ?
yeah , that' s right .
ready now , sir .
put that away and get out of here immediately .
abberline .
yeah ?
wash that off .
what ?
you heard me . it' s evidence , sir .
listen to me . in another hour , there will be a thousand people poking about in here . if those words are seen , not a jew in london will be safe .
we' il have mayhem on the streets .
so wash it off ! .
that' s an educated hand , sir .
an educated man wrote that .
look for yourself . i don' t have to look . i' ve seen it .
an educated man knows how to spell " jews . " i don' t know what this refers to , but i' m sure it' s got nothing to do ... with the people who live around here .
sergeant , i want two constables to wash that off .
what are you looking to him for ?
wash it off ! .
yes , sir .
half a dozen men have seen it already .
the sergeant has copied it down . i' il remember these words for as long as i live .
so all you' re doing is destroying its value as evidence .
no , all i' m doing is taking charge of an investigation ... that you have bungled to the point of gross inefficiency ... and i' ve had enough .
you are suspended from duty , abberline .
inspector abberline is suspended .
all his privileges are cancelled .
yes , sir .
you' ve not seen her , then ?
well , if she comes around , give her this .
long letter , eh ?
this is for your trouble .
the letter' s private .
you understand ? i understand .
right .
where' s this ?
recite the solemn oath .
never to reveal our secrets [ screaming ]
grapes again .
why grapes ?
this ain' t killing for profit .
he' s not that foolish .
you oughta be botherin' mcqueen .
are you questioning my decision ?
find a scapegoat .
this is ritual .
jubela, jubelo, jubelum .
juwes .
it' s me , ada .
me .
only me .
i bring everything for supper .
you little thief . i need this money . i just take some money and buy food for me and for you . is that bad , marie ? it' s fine , dear .
you' re a good person , but listen .
until i go away from london , it' s not safe for you to go out .
understand ? i stay with marie .
beautiful marie . it' s all right , darling .
you don' t have to pay for your food .
pardon ?
here' s to our feast .
i' m so sorry to greet you like this , inspector , but but i' m rather late for an appointment .
will you excuse me if i finish dressing while we talk ?
no , no .
please , go on .
thank you .
i' d like to speak to you about the freemasons if i might , sir .
the arrangement of the coins at dark annie' s feet ... and also the locations of the bodies ... form a pentacle star .
a pentacle star is a symbol of the freemasons , is it not , sir ?
yes .
and the way that all these women were killed throats cut left to right ... organs removed .
they' re reenactments , aren' t they , sir ?
reenactments of what ?
thejuwes .
the traitors who killed hiram abiff , founder of the masons that' s how they were executed .
ah , yes .
so the great book tells us .
sojack the ripper isn' t just merely killing whores .
he' s executing traitors .
he' s a mason fulfilling a duty .
yes , i' m afraid , inspector ... that you won' t be permitted to arrest him . i don' t want to arrest him .
the ripper has one more traitor yet to kill ... and i will stop him .
did they come to you , sir ... as a loyal mason ?
did they ask you to help them cover up the prince' s secret marriage ?
that' s how it started , yes .
and then you discovered the prince had syphilis .
he' s going to die of it , inspector .
would you like a tour of the syphilis wards ?
you' re a physician ordinary to the queen ... entrusted with the well being of the heir to the throne .
only you ... had reason to believe that these unfortunates ... these whores ... these ... traitors ... destroyed your life' s work .
below the skin of history ... are london' s veins .
these symbols the mitre , the pentacle star even someone as ignorant ... and degenerate as you ... can sense that they course with energy and meaning .
i am that meaning . i am that energy .
one day , men will look back ... and say i gave birth to the 20th century .
you' re not going to see the 20th century .
roll up his sleeve .
don' t struggle .
you' il only make this more painful .
you all right , mate ?
dr. gull .
yes !
you were describing the human heart .
yes .
yes .
the human heart ... is a dense and powerful muscle ... much like the organic equivalent of mahogany .
and notoriously difficult ... to burn .
about the size of a fist ... it provides the motor power for the circulatory system .
the heart contains two atria , two ventricles ... and four valves .
it is , in effect , a single pump ... powering a double circuit .
in the adult the heart rate averages 70 to 80 beats a minute .
such is the force of the heartbeat ... that if the body' s largest artery , the aorta , is severed ...
a six foot jet of blood ... is released .
let the brother receive the light .
for you fear no god , arise .
your faith is well founded .
don' t .
don' t go in there .
there' s no need .
how bad is it ?
she' s she' s in pieces , sir .
sergeant , he can go in .
give him to me !
he' il be taken care of , i swear to it . i want him .
he' s done . i give you my word .
fuck your word ! i' il bring every last one of you fucking cunts down .
you and your fucking brothers !
now , listen to me , abberline .
your situation your difficult situation has been thoroughly discussed .
you are reinstated . indeed , you are promoted .
no !
no .
come on .
this is not helping anything .
come on !
come on .
don' t be a fool , inspector .
you will be very closely watched .
yeah, you' re all there now , ain' t ya ?
where were you when this was happening ? it' s all right for you , standing around there chatting .
what about us ? inspector abberline is in charge .
give him all the assistance he requires .
no !
remember, you' re being watched .
all right , come on , you men .
clear this passage .
come on .
move ' em away .
move back !
back !
shall we proceed , inspector ?
body lies in middle of bed .
shoulders flat , but axis of body inclined toward right .
the left arm is close to the body ... the forearm flexed at a right angle ... resting across the abdomen .
the right arm is slightly abducted from the body . it rests on the mattress with the elbow bent ... and the forearm supine .
the fingers are clenched , indicating a struggle as she died .
notice something , inspector ?
no .
no , go on .
came in not long before dawn .
a bit of a rush .
left this for ya .
i know you asked me to wait . if i' m to be murdered , i' d like at least to die in my village . i' m going to the orphanage to collect baby alice .
here' s an address where you can find us .
we' il wait for you eagerly . i know i know in my heart ... we can be happy living by the sea ... just as you saw . i hope to be with you soon , dearest .
all my love , mary .
we are deeply distressed , lord hallsham .
we are deeply distressed , lord hallsham .
we asked sir william to remove a threat to our family and to our throne ... not to engage in these ghastly rituals .
oh , no , of course not , your majesty .
that was unexpected .
on the other hand , he has fulfilled his duties .
the threat is passed , your majesty . in his way sir william has been loyal ... and we are grateful for that .
the rest is in your hands , lord hallsham .
we wish to hear nothing further of this .
knight of the east ... we are gathered here beneath the god of love ... and before the sight of the great architect to judge this case .
you stand accused of mayhems that have placed our brotherhood in jeopardy .
you stand before your peers masons and doctors both . i have no peers present here .
what ?
no man amongst you is fit to judge ... the mighty art that i have wrought .
your rituals are empty oaths you neither understand ... nor live by .
the great architect speaks to me .
he is the balance where my deeds are weighed and judged ... not you .
knight of the east ... hear our judgement .
well , they' re not watching you anymore .
i' m telling you , it' s safe to go to her .
they think she' s dead . if i disappear or change my routine suddenly ... they might wonder why .
you know who you' re gonna turn into , don' t you ?
that boring old bugger in the pub that nobody wants to sit beside .
' cause as soon as he' s had a few drinks , he goes on and on ... about the girl that got away .
do you want to live the rest of your life like a ghost ?
no .
what i want is to go to her .
but at the slightest hint that she' s alive , they will spare no expense no expense and no trouble .
so i stay ... and watch them .
alice !
alice !
come in , darling .
coming , mother .
get up .
get up !
come on .
good night , sweet prince .
