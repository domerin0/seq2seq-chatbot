1949 , jan .
15th .
after a few years of failure ,
i was certain the worst was yet to come .
it was a boarding school for difficult children .
at least that' s what the ad said .
pond bottom
the school seemed to be named just for me .
good morning .
you are alone ?
what are you doing here ?
i' m waiting for saturday .
why ?
because my father will come and fetch me .
but today is not saturday .
pepinot !
i' m clement mathieu , the new prefect .
is this your first prefect position ?
i once taught in a private school .
what did you teach ?
music .
you will get on well with mr. rachin
the headmaster .
he used to play the trumpet .
really ?
these are his daughters , he lives here .
have you met him before ?
not yet , i got the job through mme boissement .
really ?
that was uncle maxence
he proceeded to explain that he was in charge of ... security , first aid , store room , and window repair .
what is he doing ?
student punished by mr rachin .
15 days of community service ...
maid work
what are the kids like ?
didn' t they tell you ?
no .
this is the infirmary .
later i will show you my little vegetable patch .
with pleasure .
what have they done this time ?
let' s me help you ...
are you clement mathieu ?
the headmaster .
rachin , headmaster .
ah , headmaster , i am sorry .
yes , you are late .
i was given the wrong bus timetable .
keeping on time is a basic principle here .
very well .
headmaster .
very well , headmaster .
ok , follow me .
i first suggest you learn our regulations .
you will supervise study after 4pm .
what' s the matter !
answer !
take this
another trap .
our pupils ' lovely disposition .
let' s sit him down there .
i can' t see .
don' t overdo it , let me take a look .
not so good .
you , go ring the bell , call everyone .
shouldn' t we call a doctor first ?
you know how much they cost ?
what did i tell you , go ring the bell .
where is the bell ?
open the door , you' il see it .
everyone here !
everyone here !
does this kind of incident often happen ?
ring , just ring the bell .
everyone in the yard !
quickly , keep quiet .
egg head !
quiet !
bullet head !
quiet !
keep quiet .
i didn' t say anything !
quiet !
i' ve called you out because uncle maxence has just been wounded in a cowardly attack .
according to our " action reaction " principle , the one responsible shall be severely punished .
if the guilty one does not turn himself in within 3 seconds ,
you will all take turns in jail , 6 hours each .
until he turns himself in or is denounced .
one two three
no one ?
naturally .
come here .
you , mathieu
me ?
come here .
mr. chabert , give me the record book , thank you
mr. mathieu , the new prefect , is fortunate not to know you yet .
egg head !
be quiet .
he will therefore decide impartially who will be punished first .
be quiet !
pick a name .
at random ?
if i may ...
leave him .
go ahead
boniface
unlucky .
chabert , bring boniface out .
but , i didn' t do anything !
shut up !
it' s unfair !
shut your mouth !
let' s go .
i won' t go !
i' il kick your ass if i have to !
quiet !
in addition , as long as the criminal is at large , recess is canceled ,
and visits are forbidden .
i invite you to denounce him as fast as possible .
this only encourages denouncing .
like all new comers , you have generous illusions .
let' s talk again in a week .
until then have mr regent show you your quarters .
you' re taking over from him .
clean sheets .
thanks .
why are you leaving ?
10 stitches
scissors .
all this because i confiscated mouton' s cigarettes .
mouton ?
a kid .
his name is mouton .
is he still here , this mouton ?
for your info , le querrec is the one who set the trap on maxence' s door .
i overheard him talking about it .
why did you keep silent ?
i don' t want to miss the bus .
maxence punished him for breaking some window panes .
it' s a revenge .
just his style .
le querrec , you have remember this name .
and " morange " , yes , " morange
he speaks little , but you have to keep an eye on him .
angel face , but possessed by the devil .
action/ reaction , that' s all they understand .
i' m leaving .
good luck !
thank you .
our benefactor .
this is the class schedule .
classes were split between the headmaster , doing history and french , while the rest was taught by a certain mr langlois .
mr. langlois , let me introduce our new prefect .
my name is clement mathieu
a prefect at your age ?
yes , i was once a teacher .
that is perfect .
he' s the funniest of the lot .
go to the study room now you are late .
no need to show you the way ...
gentlemen .
smoking is forbidden in class , everyone , even you , sir .
give it back to me , quiet !
give it back to me .
good start !
congratulations .
mathieu
be seated .
naturally .
you , always you .
what did he do ?
nothing .
headmaster
what do you mean , nothing .
didn' t you want to punish him just now ?
i was asking him to the blackboard , and requesting silence when you came in .
indeed you needed silence .
don' t let me have to come back .
go to the corner .
all right .
now that you know me better , we need to set a few things straight .
right now , one of your fellow pupils is in jail .
for nothing .
i may not look smart , but i was not born yesterday .
i know who did it .
i give him 15 seconds to confess .
i am waiting .
too bad .
only 5 seconds left .
too late .
le querrec , who is le querrec
me , sir
what a coincidence .
so , it is you who wounded mr. maxence .
no . not me .
i am not asking you .
i am telling you .
i did nothing .
who do you think the headmaster will believe , you or me ?
while i am out , i would like someone serious to watch over the class .
if i believe my trusted intuition , this serious person is mr morange .
be quiet , who is morange ?
me , sir .
so , you are the angel face
go to the blackboard .
you watch the class while i am out .
let' s go !
nice attire .
pull your shirt out further , it' s more proper .
black sheep are said to have authority over their peers .
prove it to me .
let' s go .
to the headmaster .
have mercy , sir .
mercy ?
did you show mercy on the classmate who is in jail instead of you ?
how about uncle maxence ?
i didn' t want to harm him .
it was just a joke .
a joke ?
it' s enough .
do you hear , you' il get a good beating in my office .
who is that ?
it' s leclerc , he ran away for the third time .
he will be sent to jail .
this way you' il have a companion .
let' s go .
no .
listen .
maybe we can make a deal .
you wounded uncle maxence badly .
really bad .
i will not bring you to the headmaster , but i' il punish you .
from now on , during recess , you' il work in the infirmary .
you will look after uncle maxence , until he is recovered .
do you agree ?
not bad , ah ?
i believe i can do better .
show me your profile .
profile .
i give you a little smile for a change .
there you go .
have a look .
ah , i forget .
a little spot of colour .
does it look better ?
go back to you seat .
all right , in order to know you better ,
please write down your name , age and what you want to do when you grow up .
to my surprise , all the pupils did as they were asked .
everybody , expect one .
aren' t you writing ?
how long have you been here ?
a long time ?
i don' t know .
come on , write , little boy .
an exhausting first day .
i don' t know why i am here .
rachin scares me .
this place scares me .
even the kids scare me .
i feel they may run into my room at any time and do me in .
my blanket .
give me a puff .
shut up .
go to sleep .
i read what the pupils wrote .
they were all dreaming of fabulous carreers .
two firemen , three cowboys , one tiger tamer , one fighter pilot two spies , a general under napoleon . one hot air balloon pilot , three soldiers .
no prefect .
it' s very kind to volunteer to take care of me .
see , doctor , the new prefect asked for a volunteer .
and he responded .
spontaneously .
this shows miracles do happen .
please come in .
this is mr. mathieu , our new prefect .
how are you how are you
how is he ?
it' s quite a bad gash .
if now they come after you , hope is lost .
you have such infinite patience towards them .
i' m hard headed .
the poor kids have it way worse than me here .
one of them died here .
one died ?
his name was mouton .
jumped from the rooftop .
fortunately , he was an orphan .
like him , everyone says nothing can be done .
but that' s not true .
he' s a good boy .
you just need to know him .
uncle maxence is kind , isn' t he ?
le querrec , i am talking to you .
uncle maxence is kind , isn' t he ?
yes .
i can' t hear you .
leave him alone .
he is shy , just like me .
yes ?
i need to talk to you .
headmaster .
you already want to leave ?
no , i just want to do an experiment .
about uncle maxence' s accident .
that was no accident .
sure .
i would like you to grant me three things .
what ?
first , lift the collective punishment .
second , allow me to punish the guilty one .
third , please allow me to keep his name to myself .
provided you have the name .
of course , only provided i have it .
you are arrogant , man .
so , you believe you can find him just like that .
alright .
if you succeed , i' il lift the punishment .
you' il never find the guilty party , or i am the king of imbeciles .
i know who did it , sir .
is that so .
who is it ?
you allowed me to keep his name a secret .
good , very good .
but your methods irritate me .
don' t let me find anything wrong with your class .
i feel i already have them well under control .
you speak too soon .
these are not naughty pictures .
i never said they were naughty pictures .
what' s written on yours ?
ave maria , soprano , by clement mathieu
mine says cord quatuor , by clement mathieu
this looks like music sheets .
how do you know ?
maybe it' s morse code ?
secret codes ?
maybe he' s a spy .
yes , possibly a spy disguised as a prefect .
quick !
egghead is coming .
give it back to me .
what is it , sir .
none of your business .
any problem , mathieu ?
no , nothing .
these are music sheets .
what for ?
a choir
in the toilet ...
choir , out you go .
none of this here , mathieu none of what ?
don' t pretend you don' t know what i am talking about .
certainly you don' t believe ...
i' il close one eye this time .
you really see evil everywhere .
here ?
yes .
bullet head you' re finished .
you won' t make the rules here .
you won' t make the rules here .
you won' t make the rules here .
you won' t make the rules here .
hey , guys , are you chicken or what ?

sir , i did nothing .
yes , you are singing .
sir , i swear .
you are singing , besides , off key .
you don' t even know .

maybe you want to sing in the principal' s office .
bullet head you' re finished .
bullet head you' re finished .
you won' t make the rules here .
you won' t make the rules here .
no one ever told you that you sing really bad ...
is it true you have music in your briefcase , sir ?
mind your own business .
which reminds me .
the next one i catch going through my things , it will cost him dearly .
now , silence .
go to sleep .
finished .
sleep .
i have this tune stuck in my head .
they don' t sing very well , but they sing .
i even spotted a few good voices .
is there really nothing we can do with these kids ?
me who swore never to touch my music sheets again .
never say never .
there' s always something to try .
january 23 , one week after the accident . uncle maxence' s takes a turn for the worse .
the doctor has him sent to the hospital .
will he die ?
no , they will save him .
that same day , pepinot got in trouble .
mr. pepinot , you are hopeless .
last question , last one
how did marshall ney die ?
i am waiting .
hunting ?
zero .
marshall ney was executed .
dismissed
boniface
come here boy .
boniface

it' s a reward for your composition
you take this to madam marie , she will give you a biscuit .
you did know that marshall ney was shot ?
yes , sir , just like napoleon .
get out .
wait , mr. morange
i saw you taking notes during my class .
i must say such studiousness surprises me .
bring me your notebook .
charming .
there .
read it .
admire the spelling .
mr. rachin eats shit by the crate .
did he write ' mr. ' ?
err , no
mr. mathieu , action and reaction , put him in jail .
let' s go
gentlemen , good appetite .
are you hungry pepinot ?
there , you can eat now .
pepinot is an orphan .
his parents died during the war .
how did they die ?
don' t know .
the kid got it in his head that his father will come pick him up on saturday .
every saturday , nobody comes .
we tell him it' s for next week , and so on .
wouldn' t it be better to tell him the truth ?
we told him a 100 times that his dad and mum are both dead .
nothing doing .
now , we let him wait by the gate , it makes him happy .
be quiet .
you see ?
action and reaction .
what do you mean ?
action ?
reaction !
someone is asking for the morange boy .
morange ?
he is in jail .
no visit for the punished ones .
you know the rules
you go tell the visitor yourself .
how are you , madam .
how are you .
i am the new prefect .
i am pierre morange' s mother .
clement mathieu
i know it' s not visiting day today , but it' s the only free time ...
that' s not it ...
he is punished again ?
no , no , he is not punished .
but he is not here .
why ?
he was sent to the dentist an hour ago .
tooth ache .
tooth ache .
yes tooth ache .
but nothing serious .
he will be back in the evening .
i can' t wait .

we are from pond bottom .
that is what is bothering us
we are from pond bottom .
that is rather disconcerting
we are from pond bottom .
that is what is bothering us .
not bad .
it was rather basic , but i had their attention .
to move things along , i needed support from my hierarchy .
what ?
a choir ?
yes
poor mathieu , you have gone off your rocker .
a choir ?
they will never sing a note , or i am the king of ...
please sir .
do not tell me king of what .
why ?
because they are already singing .
really ?
a little .
so why do you come ask me for an authorisation since you' ve already gone ahead .
i don' t like your methods , you hear me ?
sir
you are bothering me .
i have other problems to deal with .
all right .
i too want to have a laugh .

thank you for your kind words of encouragement , sir .

rachin is relentless on morange

hey , maid , don' t forget to make my bed !

a visit from dr. dervaux .
he is a psychologist
he brought us a little present .
we decided to bring this boy from st fereol' s juvenile detention centre .
to study his capacity to adapt to a more liberal environment .
unlike most of his classmates , mondain is starting to read and write .
in any case , he can talk
more or less normally .
we submitted his intellect to the binet simon test
ah , the binet simon test !
we also gave him rorchar' s test
good .
the test , as you know , divides children' s intelligent into 7 categories .
normal , adequate , borderline , slightly retarded , medium , severely retarded
and finally , imbeciles
mondain is in the borderline zone .
he is therefore not demented .
i must however warn you .
he exhibit gregarious instinct pervert tendencies .
bad enough .
what exactly does that mean ?
doctor ?
prone to cruelty , parasitism and destruction .
above all ,
mythomania there you have it .
we already have lots like that here .
except here kids have access to maistream teaching .
it will be interesting to see how mondain can integrate
least we can do .
we will all try to meet your scientific expectations .
gentlemen , kindly take charge of this boy .
may i keep you for lunch ?
with pleasure .
as for him , give him all the necessary attention .
action and reaction .
no smoking here .
to start the experiment on a good footing , i first have to establish my authority .
you really look like a jerk .
you better lie low , or there will be trouble .
ok .
there will be trouble .
surely you know at least one song ?
yes , but ...
but what ?
you will not like it .
let' s have it .
come on .
come on
i am listening .
stop enough .
i told you .
not bad , needs practice .
but you have quite a good baritone voice .
what voice ? baritone , it is not an insult .
describes singers with a deep voice .
go to the back , with the basses .
bitch .
let the bitch rest .
the next one who laughs gets my fist in his face .
whenever you wish , mondain
isolation over
i brought pepinot back .
you forgot him by the gate .
pepinot , it' s not saturday today .
by the way , in the letters to your parents
i don' t have any parents .
of course , to those who have parents
remind them that they can visit you on the first or third thursday of the month .
morange , you are already distracted .
what did i just say ?
i don' t know .
i just said , you can write to your mother
to visit you on the first or third thursday every month .
or on both days , got it ?
but punished pupils cannot get visits so be careful .
i don' t feel like seeing my parents .
but morange may want to see his mother .
maybe he' s not the only one .
see , morange , we have a real choir now .
i don' t care .
what do you mean you don' t care ?
what kind of voice do you have ?
do a scale .
do " ...
come on .
do you want to go back to jail ?
come on , quick .
rudeness does not look good on you , my boy .
not everyone can be like mondain .
let' s start again .
where are you going ?
i' ve had enough , i am going to the toilet .
mondain , wait .
come, corbin can i also go to the toilet, sir ?
all right , everybody out .
quiet , quiet
you sing well , pretty girl .
you want some ?
they left you all alone ?
i will protect you .
wait for me .
we are alike .
my parents are assholes .
your mother is the same way .
she leaves you here to have peace .
no , she has to work
ah , so what the others say is true .
what ?
she is a whore
get in !
you' re a dead man !
am i ?
that day , morange was missing at the 3pm roll call .
no one ever knew where he went , but he came back .
that' s what mattered .
why are you here ?
i' m not allowed to go upstairs
what do you mean ?
why ?
because i have no money
you have no money , so you can' t sleep ?
what is this all about ?
it' s mondain .
if i don' t give him money , he won' t let me upstairs .
we must be careful
where i was before i was caught by the prefect .
so i had to let him have it .
how ?
stabbed him with a bayonet .
he bled well .
did you kill him ?
you bet
it' s the same here .
egg head better leave me alone .
mathieu is not the worst .
are you kidding ?
singing you a lullaby ,
then when you sleep he will come and touch you .
this type must all be killed .
good evening , gentlemen
have a good appetite !
i swear i didn' t do anything , sir !
i see you have high class friends , corbin
get out !
this feast i just witnessed will be our secret .
gift to you .
but i warn you ,
don' t speak to pepinot , don' t approach him
don' t even look at him , is that clear ?
a single look towards him and i' il turn your life into a nightmare
what are you doing here , morange ?
nothing , sir
i must have heard voices i must be tired .
article 8 of school regulations : students are not allowed into classrooms alone
if it were mr. rachin , you would have to write it a 100 times for tomorrow .
plus what he would tell your mother .
i don' t care about my mother
what did she do , tell me !
i have nothing to tell you
wait !
i' m not finished .
you won' t get off that easily .
nothing is free here , ask pepinot
your problem , morange , is that you do things that are unlike you .
run away , get into fights , play truant
it may amuse the others , but not me .
i won' t play your little game .
from tomorrow , compulsory choir practice .
and daily music class .
go , go to sleep
go
march 3
he cannot know , but i am sure of it .
his voice is a miracle
the rare promise of an exceptional musical gift .
you can go now , keep quiet
keep quiet !
gradually , as my choir gets better
i domesticate my new student .
ok , take your calculus notebooks
you are the one who makes the children sing ?
yes , isr are you complaining ?
oh , no , on the contrary i love music ,
i sometimes myself croon do you ?
have a nice day !
same to you , my dear colleague
algebra book , page 27
hello , madam
pierre will come soon
what happened ?
everything is fine
how about his tooth ?
it got better
did you tell him i dropped by ?
no why ?
i preferred not to tell him .
as you know , pierre is a sensitive child , and talented . a talent for mischief .
not only that ,
i must talk to you about it
singing ?
nobody taught him ?
he has a gift .
it' s obvious .
something must be done .
hello
i' il leave the two of you .
don' t hesitate to come and see me .
i didn' t tell your mother you were punished , i told here you were at the dentist .
no betrayal .
i' m told that you sing well ?
yes
the gentleman seems happy with you , is he kind to you ?
not bad
i brought you clean clothes , and i made your favourite chocolate cake .
are you happy ?
april , the children inspire me .
i knew the day would come when my music would be played .
i' m clement mathieu , musician , every night , i compose for them .
it was not good , sir ?
yes , good , it was very good .
you bastard !
go !
what did he do ?
he stole my watch .
caught him in my bedroom .
bringing him to see rachin .
action reaction
where are you taking him ?
jail !
15 days !
wait !
wait for what ?
he is my only barytone
mathieu !
what' s the matter , sir ?
i found graffiti in the ...
sorry , sir , just a loose shot
stand aside !
mathieu , chabert ,
with me
as the weeks pass , i score new victories .
leclerc , we are still good friends , ain' t we ?
of course , why do you ask this ?
5 plus 3 ?
53
are you sure ?
of course
thanks !
maybe it' s only an illusion , but
it seems that even our headmaster is changing
look , uncle maxence
attention , don' t move
smile
come on , come out , mondain !
it' s finished , child
come on !
chabert , i just met mr rachin
to tell him that mathieu' s choir is fantastic
i' m tired but you are alawys so tired , alright 29 !
and what was his answer ?
get the hell out is what he told me .
where is mondain ?
didn' t you notice he was missing before the run ?
he was at roll call this morning , headmaster
after that , he ...
good , in this case , i forbid all outside walks until the end of the year .
did he take much money ?
all the money , around 200 thousands francs
how do i pay suppliers now ?
how ?
i should never have accepted him in here .
all this for a damn experiment !
just like you , with your music
i needed coal delivered for hot water , it will be next week .
i call the police .
what' s the matter ?
i observe that singing makes them smarter , mathieu
they make great progress
headmaster , children have had no warm water for three weeks
cold water is good for blood circulation .
by the way , mathieu
no more choir .
but , headmaster thanks , mr. mathieu
police station , please
i don' t know yet about the choir
but for the kids , we can use wood .
we have no firewood at all !
headmaster' s personal storage
chabert , " action " " reaction
chabert surprised me
i thought he was rachin' s clone
he actually is a nice man , who believes sports and music are the cements of our society .
with his help , i organize resistance
our choir becomes a clandestine affair .
no , you always let up at the end of the sentence
i' m asking one last time to detach every note clearly .
it' s late , we' il work on this tomorrow
we are not doing the second part , sir ?
i didn' t teach you the solo part
but i learnt it .
you did ?
ok , let' s begin
come on , come out
may 13th , 3pm , mondain is back
where is the money ?
i don' t know
who stole it ?
i don' t know , not me
what' s happening ?
he is beating him ?
for half an hour
is he mad ?
he is wasting his time , the child won' t say anything at all
ok , let' s start from the beginning
where is the money ?
tell me !
where is the money ?
let go !
let go !
calm down !
calm down !
the child has just confessed , i' il call back the police .
you will get to know another residence , with other wardens and bars .
to avoid depressing the children , we did not tell them about the mondain affair .
we told them he was sent back to his original school .
end of story .
a hen
lays 84 eggs every year
well fed , with good housing ,
ventilation and sanitation ,
it will lay 150 eggs
how many more eggs can a farm girl obtain if she owns 9 hens ?
nice day ?
it' s good to have a bit of sun .
summer days are coming .
you know , pierre surprises me everyday a bit more
anyway , i ..
i wanted to thank you for what you do for him .
i do it for you as well
i mean , if pierre is good , so will you be ...
let me wipe it it' s ok , it' s ok
just ink , nevermind you are too much !
idiot !
what' s the matter ?
oh !
why do you beat him ?
tell me , bebert
because he threw ink at you
can' t you shut up ?
pierre , i' m ashamed of you .
wait !
it' s ok !
you have to understand , it' s because he is proud of you and you are pretty
pretty ?
i mean , you are unusual comparing with other children' s mother
do you mean that i' m alone ?
me too .
but you have no children no
i have sixty
but when they see you , they see the lady of their dreams
i mean , the mother they all dreamt about
it' s not a dream for pierre , you are his mother
like all other children , he doesn' t want to share with others
we must get him out of this boarding school where he' s wasting his time and send him to music school .
i' d like him to have a real job .
music is a true career
provided one has solid grounding .
he could go to lyons institute of music ,
i' d keep an eye on him so he does not stray .
even there , you can get a bad teacher
and then ?
then , he will become whatever he must .
alone we can' t do anything .
pierre is an exception .
i will do everything in my power so that his talent can bloom .
but it need your help , too i see , thanks
no , no !
what' s the matter , today ?
are you all sleepy ?
and you , boniface , how do you stand ?
do you think we can sing like this ?
stand straight !
ok , again , start from " so gentle ...
where is my solo ?
what solo ?
my solo !
ah , yes , your solo , no , no solo any more
you have a decent voice , but no one is indispensible .
you sing or not .
it does not matter to me .
we can do without you .
listen .
listen , we start ...
we start from " oh , night
mathieu !
you' re gonna get a scolding ...
i thought he had gone to town ?
dismissed .
go play outside .
you are a pain , do you know that ?
headmaster , i promise you , homework is finished
our charity committee heard of your choir
the countess herself writes to me
she and her friends are visiting next sunday they want to listen
it' s great !
i mean , it' s good
i already see the scene .
simpering , music , why not petit fours since we' re at it !
you give me extra work with all these silly things of yours !
but , headmaster , you will notice that music has not relaxed discipline .
we have had less problems for quite some time .
coincidence
i don' t believe in coincidences , headmaster
it looks that way .
who apart from you would tell the foundation about the choir ?
it' s me
do you know how to write ?
uncle maxence probably thought he was doing a good thing .
spare me your explanations
i don' t like your ways , mathieu
i think you don' t like much , headmaster
mr. rachin , someone for you in the guest room !
let' s talk about this later
it' s for you
sometimes i think we should have let mondain strangle him .
violette was thanking me for what i was doing for her son .
she wanted to talk to me about it privately
and tell me something important .
rendez vous at square cafe , 20th , 4pm
i wrote a letter to the lyons institute of music
i know the principal there
he kindly answered he would be glad to audition your son , and in case he is admitted ,
he would help him get a scolarship .
things will be easier on that front from now on .
is that so ?
after i met you ,
my ... my life ...
how to say ?
change totally ?
exactly !
it' s all thanks to you
i could not imagine ...
same here .
i had lost hope ...
i' m thinking , maybe i' m wrong to go too fast .
ah , no , trust me , no problem
it' s true that you brought me luck .
luck ?
i met someone ,
he is an eningeer from lyons
i met him at the cafe .
he works around here on a bridge project .
are you ok ?
fine
it' s a great opportunity , for you and pierre .
don' t get upset .
i have to run .
i' m love for the three of us to have lunch together one of these days .
you will tell him about pierre ?
please ?
why not
ok , goodbye
goodbye
thanks for all you' ve done
oh , not a word to pierre for the time being .
sorry , may i take the chair ?
of course thanks
countess , i ... glad ... flowers .
i did not catch everything , but i get the intention .
thank you , my child
countess , please allow me to introduce you to mr. mathieu ,
our prefect , who makes our dear children sing .
countess
please accept my compliments , sir ,
we follow with great interest the humane and sensitive teaching methods of mr rachin .
we thank you for your contribution to these methods .
by the way , who came up with the idea for the choir ? ...
well ...
mine , countess , my idea
it is a great pleasure , countess , to help such an understanding director .
alright .
make them sing .
mr. rachin is modest , he doesn' t like praise that' s right
what will you sing , then ?
la nuit , by rameau , countess
that must be beautiful
excuse me , who is the boy standing aside ?
is he being punished ?
that boy ?
he is an exception
may i begin ?
and in the eyes of morange , who was following my rythm so well ,
i read many things .
pride , happiness to be forgiven but also something new for him , gratefulness .
first day of summer
our choir welcomes a new member
sorry , i missed the link .
my mistake .
go ahead .
come here , it' s important
i was scrubbing the toilet walls to remove graffitis .
i lifted a tile and found this
it' s corbin' s harmonica and this
at least 200 thousands francs inside
no one knew where your cache was .
don' t tell me you don' t know how the money got there .
do you know mondain was expelled because he was accused of the theft ?
i didn' t know
it' s true you did not know .
now i' ve told you
what got into you ?
what were you gonna do with the money ?
if i tell you , you won' t repeat ?
no
i swear
i wanted to buy ...
buy what ?
a hot air balloon
we don' t know who stole the money , but it proves that mondain is innocent
he would never have left without the money .
that' s obvious .
we will look into it in 2 days time , after i come back .
mathieu , don' t worry too much .
if mondain is not guilty this time , he would have been another time anyway .
nothing can be done for such people , nothing .
how about justice ?
he' s in the hands of justice now .
headmaster , wait for me !
wait for me !
are you leaving too ?
i am catching a ride .
i am spending my vacation at my sister' s .
there is a piano there
do you know why rachin goes to lyons ?
i think he needs to discuss the budget with the committee .
doesn' t he ?
yes
but actually , his main purpose is to kiss ass for promotion and a medal .
do you think he will succeed ?
crafty as he is ?
he will present an idyilic picture of the school ,
hide the terrible things you know , and take credit for the choir' s success .
success ?
i' ve heard it , it' s very good .
sir , is it true langlois and the principal left together ?
yes , chabert and carpentier took two weeks , we are masters of the place .
then there is no course today ?
no
what shall we do ?
take a nap
no , i have a better idea
excuse me , you ...
your medal ?
yes
the bird is in the nest , mr. rachin
i don' t know how to thank you
headmaster , call for you ...
excuse me , i ...
the fire started from the roof .
the blaze was eating up the sleeping quarters , where the kids were last seen .
sixty children killed , trapped like rats .
to rachin
his promotion and medal are going up in flames right in front of him .
but suddenly ...
after lunch , we got out by the back door near the vegetable garden .
so that mary and the villagers would not see us , then
we went to the lignon forest
why did you go there ?
we did an orientation game .
the kids loved it .
suffice to say , uncle maxence , i' m extremely disappointed by your behaviour .
headmaster , i assume the entire responsibility for this escapade .
uncle maxence never stopped trying to talk me out of it .
that' s what i call a lack of conviction .
on the other hand , one could say we saved the children' s lives .
well , if you had not left the school unattended , there would have been no fire !
i don' t know why i' m still listening to you .
ok , uncle maxence , considering your seniority , you will only suffer a suspension .
as for you , mr. mathieu , you are fired for breaking the school rules .
if that' s what you want , then fire me too !
it' s not for you to decide .
mr. maxence , thanks for your kindness but i believe children need you very much
think about the children , since this gentleman never does .
this is your due , here you are
you leave immediately by the 6pm bus .
i forbid you to see a single one of you pupils .
what do you mean ?
uncle maxence , make sure of it .
headmaster , before we part , let me tell you what i think of you
i know , mathieu
you are incompetent , cruel .
what about them
they didn' t choose to be here neither did i
i never wanted to be an educator .
and don' t tell me you were dreaming of burying yourself in this god forsaken place .
you had other ambitions .
me too .
you should not take out your failure on the children .
you think i enjoy playing prison warden ?
someone must do it .
but go ahead , go to paris
go knock on the minister' s door
hello !
i' m mathieu , we must use true educators not half wits .
get in , fight , since you have faith !
mathieu !
saint mathieu !
you' re a failed musician , a prefect
just a small prefect ,
what do you do in life , mr mathieu ?
i' m a prefect , prefect , prefect , prefect , prefect !
you are a madman
i' m so tired , go to hell
on the contrary , i' m leaving it
i had hoped some children would brave the interdiction and come say goodbye , but nothing .
these children' s wisdom resembled indifference .
and morange , anyway ...
on the first piece of paper , i see boniface exquisite handwriting
and the one with wrong spelling , should be pepinot' s
and the one with music notes , that' s morange .
and this one , that one
make them stop !
they' ve locked the door
at that time , i felt a surge of happiness and optimism .
i wanted to tell the whole world .
but who would have listened ?
no one knows who i am
the great artist would soon crash back to earth .
i' m clement mathieu , a failed musician , unemployed prefect
i' m clement mathieu , a failed musician , unemployed prefect
after that ?
he never got around to writing it .
but i , i can tell you
and pepinot told me .
the next day , on my road back to school
my childhood memories came back to me .
after mathieu was fired , my mother took me back .
we went to lyons , where i was admitted to the music school .
engineer wanted me to be a boarder again , my mother refused
and he left us
chabert , langlois and uncle maxence united
and denounced rachin' s abusive methods towards the students
children were questioned , rachin fired .
clement mathieu continued to teach music untill he passed away
he never tried to be famous
all he did , he kept to himself .
to him ?
no , not entirely
mr. mathieu !
wait for me
mr. mathieu !
why are you here ?
could you please take me with you ?
oh , i can' t do that
you must go back to school , otherwise you will be punished
please shall we go ?
be right back
i cannot take you away
go back
go
go
pepinot was right to believe in it .
the day mathieu was fired was a saturday
