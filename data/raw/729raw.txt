but i think we should take some time off .
away from each other .
think things through .
for what ?
everything between us is too right .
too easy .
never dramatic .
what are you talking about ?
i' m 25 years old and still waiting for that , you know , grand passion .
i mean , it' s not your fault .
you just don' t do grand .
you don' t do sweeping , romantic gestures .
look , i wanna marry you .
i wanna spend the rest of my life with you .

lord , have mercy .
quincy .
quincy .
what are you doing ?
hey , mr. gascon .
hey .
you got a handle on it ?
a handle on what ?
on the firing .
yeah .
i' ve researched .
got everything together .
okay .
all right .
excellent .
yeah , yeah .
all right , here you go .
okay .
all right .
i see names .
what is ... ?
what is this ?
yeah .
well ... ... it' s just a little hands on experience .
right .
i don' t understand what you' re talking about .
come on .
what ?
don' t go daft on me here .
i' m not .
yeah .
it' s a list of people who need to be ... ... fired .
what ?
you want me to do it ?
of course .
you' re the expert .
no , wait a minute .
i was just doing the research .
i didn' t know you were about to fire people .
yeah .
no , no .
well , see , i thought i was clear .
no , no .
well , then that' s my error .
all right .
sorry .
sorry .
okay .
okay .
well , let me know how it goes .
mr. gascon , listen .
i am not comfortable with this .
well , of course not .
to feel comfortable , you' d have to be a monster .
yeah , yeah .
no , you' re no monster .
neither am i.
right , right .
i just happen to be in the position ... ... to delegate , and you are not .
hey , good luck .
quincy .
what' s happening , man ?
hey , nothing .
you look awful .
thanks .
looks like it was quite a blowout .
yeah , i was blown out .
all right .
so , what' s up ?
this and that .
this and that ?
yeah .
sandra said you wanted to see me .
yeah .
so it' s like that , huh ?
look ...
that' s cool .
shit !
make sure mr. gascon gets this .
sure .
q.
q. come on , open up the door , man .
oh , q. man , what you wearing , q ?
you know , it feels good on my skin .
you gonna let me in ?
what you want ?
that' s for what .
your mother , my auntie' s been calling me ... ... every day early for a week .
she' s worried about you .
you can' t call her ?
been busy .
you been busy ?
i' ve been busy .
move out ...
watch the piss .
what' s that ?
you so in a hurry , you ain' t looking .
oh , no .
no , no , no .
see , this is disturbing , q.
kind of a mess , huh ?
it' s like an outer extension of disease .
where' s your stuff ?
helen , you know , she took some stuff .
took a tv .
left me with the dog and a half naked picture of herself .
just evil .
i gave her everything but my soul .
and i bet they want that too .
just greedy .
don' t give it to them .
all you gotta do is pretend to give it to them .
why do i have to pretend ?
why can' t i just be me ?
nobody finds pathetic charming .
was that cheese ?
okay , look , i' m sorry about helen , okay ?
but you got to pull yourself together , bro .
i been writing .
you been writing ?
letters to helen .
a few letters .
how many letters , q ?
i could not get the right tone .
no , how many letters ?
i just kept obsessing over the way she left me and what she told me .
then it came to me , with my employee termination research ... ... that if helen was my boss , then the way she fired me was bad ... ... bad in every way .
public humiliation , conflicting messages , horrific timing .
oh , yeah , i wrote a letter .
i wrote a letter detailing the disgust i have at her method and technique .
her method and her technique for dumping you ?
exactly .
oh , okay , man .
where is this letter ?
i' m calling your mom .
wait .
no , that is a scream for help .
i' m calling your mother .
it started out as a letter , then it evolved into a manual .
a manual on how to break up with a lover ... ... based on psychological and employee termination research .
you' re telling me you don' t find any of this strange ?
what' s strange , huh ?
what' s strange about it ?
when you break up with somebody , and firing somebody' s the same ... ... you wanna do it the easiest way without producing a stalker .
i call it <i>the plan . </ i>
<i>the plan</ i> ?
<i>the plan</ i> .
it is brilliant .
you got a table of contents ?
i don' t believe him .
committed or committable ?
time to kill .
location , location .
why break up at her place ?
you control the duration of the breakup , leave when you want .
a person can follow you if you' re at a bar , restaurant or hotel .
but ain' t nobody leaving their own apartment .
and the answering machine ?
change the outgoing message ... ... to the mechanical one because a breakup ee will call the breakup er ... ... just to hear their voice and then hang up .
and what that does , it creates a cycle of emotional desperation ... ... especially if the message says , " i' m not here .
i' m in paris ...
you see , to me , falling in love is blissful insanity .
but breaking up , that' s a rational act .
now , how do we improve upon that rational act ?
we do it through science .
what were you planning on doing with this ?
i' m ...
i got a betty i been seeing for three months .
chapter 6 .
yeah .
what' s ... ?
capricorn ?
aries .
oh , yeah .
you wanna take this on a field test .
quincy ?
we' re gonna be rich , bro .
we are gonna be so incredibly rich .
<i>how to dress .
how to act . </ i>
<i>what to wear .
what not to wear . </ i>
<i>all i' ve done is just research</ i> <i>and realize that you can break up ... </ i> <i> ... but improve on it by the science . </ i>
that' s my boyfriend' s cousin there .
who' s that , honey ?
the guy on tv , talking about the book he wrote on how to break up .
not exactly leading us out of the dark ages , is he ?
he' s kind of cute , though .
what' s he like ?
i don' t know .
i never met him .
but i know he is one lonely puppy .
why do you say that ?
what woman would go out with a guy whose expertise is dumping people ?
you got a point .
okay , here we go .
<i>what' s your love life like ? </ i>
<i>are you seeing anyone ? </ i>
<i>give me a second . </ i>
so , what do you want me to do ?
something drastic .
i' ve been seeing evan for three months ... ... and i really like him , but he' s getting a bit twitchy .
you know how the fine ones are .
i think i need to shock him .
i need to shock myself .
i had that dream again .
the one with the straps ?
no .
the one with halle berry .
so ...
dreaming of halle before a haircut ... ... is as clear a sign you' re gonna get in this lifetime .
how does it feel to be in the building as an author and not a slave ?
i can wait by philip' s office .
i don' t want you to be lonely .
lonely ?
you gotta get out more ... ... because it' s depressing seeing you .
a fan wrote me a letter , said i was arrogant .
no , no .
let me tell you something .
you have supplied ... ... a humanitarian service to the world .
no .
no , listen to me .
you should feel good about that .
how is anybody gonna find their one true love ... ... when they' re stuck in a bunch of dead end relationships ?
quincy ... ... you are a love enabler .
i just need somebody normal .
oh , see , there you go .
there are no normal relationships .
you know why ?
because there are no normal women .
you know what ?
a girl came to my crib .
never seen her before .
says that she dug the book .
whoa , whoa , whoa .
wait .
a groupie .
oh , my boy had his first groupie .
groupies are there to please , okay .
they' re there to do whatever , whenever , however you want , kid .
i couldn' t close the deal .
oh , q !
don' t tell me that , man .
do you know what i' d do to get with a groupie ?
if it happens again , you can pretend you' re me .
i' m gonna do that .
i gotta meet up with nicky later .
you wanna check her out ?
nope .
how many weeks she got left ?
technically , her time' s almost up .
but she' s a little freaky .
so ...
you like her .
no .
you gazed into just midair .
no , i ...
when you like people , you gaze .
all right , you know what it is ?
she has this long , black , thick , sexy , sexy hair .
just got the weirdest pain in my nuts .
i don' t want to be staring at that .
anyway , you' d like her , q. she does physical therapy at the hospital .
you know , she' s bright .
mulatto ?
no , no .
a little cinnamon .
okay .
bright like smart .
yeah , bright like smart .
she' s tough .
she has body and that long , long , black hair .
oh , shit , there it is again .
boy , you are too old to be having the crabs .
you been putting that where you ain' t supposed to ?
it' s a very social organ , but ...

sorry .
okay , that' s the wrong name .
excuse me .
quincy .
did you ask me my name ?
no .
you didn' t just ... ?
okay , well , my name is quincy .
okay .
mary .
mary , nice to meet you .
i was actually here because my cousin sent me to find his girlfriend .
she has long hair .
i never realized how many women ... ... in l. a. had long hair .
no other distinguishing characteristics like a scar or a tattoo ... ... dimples or something ?
pretty smile .
no , not to my knowledge .
maybe her description of you is more detailed than yours of her .
she doesn' t know me .
she thinks she' s coming to meet her boyfriend .
but she' s not ?
no , no .
my cousin sent me because ... ... for some reason , he is terrified she' s gonna break up with him .
why would he think that ?
because she wants to talk .
he ever think she' d wanna talk about something else ?
you know women when they just want to talk .
you guys , when y' all wanna talk , y' all talk .
and y' all talking .
just talky talk .
we' re funny like that .
really .
what' d he expect you to do about it ?
he wants me to chat her up ... ... tell her how great of a guy he is .
that' s really high school .
i said the same thing .
and the cold part is i gotta lie .
he ain' t great .
what do you mean ?
he' s a misogynist .
he' s a player , you know ?
and he has a three month commitment clause .
really ?
yeah , yeah .
no , a firm policy .
sounds like a real peach .
even within the three months ... ... he messes with other girls anyway .
so i' m like , " what' s the deal ?
yeah , what is the deal ?
enough .
want a drink ?
yeah , a bloody mary .
can i get a double , please ?
mary likes bloody marys .
that' s cute .
yeah .
so , quincy , what is it that you do ?
i am an editor for <i>spoil</ i> magazine .
really ?
wow .
you know , you remind me of someone .
you remind me of somebody too .
really ?
halle berry .
you got that .
thanks .
yeah .
q.
no show .
damn .
that' s a sign , isn' t it ?
like a flashing red light before a cliff .
wanna go get something to drink , man ?
i can' t , man .
i just met this babe .
we might go get some dinner and a club later .
i didn' t mention that i wrote the book .
is that dishonest ?
you' re on a date .
it' s all dishonest .
all right .
strange .
you were gonna meet your date , i was gonna meet mine .
and we meet each other at the same time .
strange .
that' s not strange .
no ?
no .
you wanna hear strange ?
give me strange .
teratomas .
that' s them little cookies ?
they come in a package ?
that' s tiramisu .
teratomas .
they' re tumors that can grow inside our bodies ... ... formed by all three embryonic precursors .
what does that mean ?
it means that they have hair ... ... and skin and glands , so they sweat like you are now , and brain tissue .
i saw one pulled out of a woman the size of a basketball .
and when they cut it open , she had a full row of teeth .
all the stuff that comes together to form human life are there .
but somehow they dissemble into something hideous .
it' s crazy .
so , what' s the strangest thing that you know ?
can' t bite through your own skin .
what ?
it' s impossible .
first law of nature : self preservation .
you can' t do it , because you' re selfish .
i can' t bite through my own flesh , because i' m too selfish ?
try to .
no .
bite into yourself .
that' s lame .
bite yourself .
all right .
you want some hot sauce ?
i can' t bite into my skin , because i' m sane .
it' s the same thing , biologically speaking .
see , if you' re not selfish ... ... that means you' re crazy and you could do it .
what about if you care about someone more than you care about yourself ?
first , why would you do that ?
second , are you talking about love ?
yeah .
love .
if someone is in love , therefore not selfish , then he or she is crazy ... ... and could bite through his or her own flesh .
so being in love and being crazy are one and the same ?
it' s obvious .
wanna bite your other hand ?
no .
wanna bite me ?
i' m tender .
i' m moist .
i' m loving .
hello .
quincy watson , i presume ?
yeah .
yeah , that' s me .
quincy .
quincy watson .
what' s up ?
come on .
i' m rita monroe .
oh , yes , you are , rita .
that' s his way of saying hello .
oh , god .
hello , rita .
drink ?
you do know why i' m here ?
i do know .
i do .
do ... ?
do i ... ?
do i know why ?
one second .
so you read my book ?
i' m familiar with it .
i' m also familiar with the fact that you plan ... ... on giving my philip breakup pointers .
not a very good idea .
i' m completely ...
everyone has a job , and mine is to become mrs. philip gascon .
i' m sorry .
you were saying ?
i' m saying that i think we need to work some things out .
one professional to another .
professional ?
don' t be under any illusions .
it' s not all love .
it' s not love .
i think i understand now .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
i wasn' t expecting you to be so ...
what ?
so honest ?
straightforward .
there' s no need for us to work against each other on this .
you wanna talk compensation ?
wow .
very direct .
was i too fast for you ?
no .
i' m just used to placating ... ... scared little rabbits , you know ?
i' m not used to doing business with a real man .
i need to find an atm .
oh , what the hell ?
look at the town drunk .
where am i ?
you' re in my living room .
what kind of man corrupts another man' s dog ?
you see a woman around ?
you that freaky ... ... you need help to get a dog drunk ?
what you do to the dog ?
i' m gonna report you .
it' s not your dog , it' s your ex' s .
if helen came home now and saw an alcoholic pug , what would she say ?
you can' t let pugs drink , they' re not rottweilers .
they got little bitty kidneys .
helen' s not coming back .
it ain' t about helen .
no .
and it' s definitely not about the dog .
i don' t know what kind of freaky stuff ...
you got my drawers on ?
mr. lynch , i' ve told you ... ... don' t take your clothes off for therapy .
hold my dick .
okay .
i' il come back when you get dressed .
<i>dr .
jacobs , call 2035 . </ i>
evan called .
one o' clock , your place .
a little afternoon delight ?
oh , he' s so romantic .
you guys are the reason i date .
he thinks i' m breaking up with him .
he' s freaking out .
are you ?
no , or i wasn' t .
then i went on a date with quincy , who thinks i' m mary .
and found out that if true , evan is satan .
not that quincy' s reliable , given he lied about ... ... what he does or did in writing that book .
but he did seem sincere , and there' s the craziest freaking attraction that' s ...
oh , god .
so i guess the answer' s yes .
yes , what ?
i' m dumping evan' s ass for lunch .
hey .
you' re late .
what are we doing way out here ?
spies .
i don' t think you fully realize the seriousness of the situation i' m in .
i got techniques for you so good you will never worry about this girl again .
now , what' s the plan ?
early supper , maybe a dvd back at my place .
can we get the dvd at her place ?
her place .
now , what do i say ?
nothing .
nothing ?
it' s what you do .
well , what do i do ?
you sulk .
pardon ?
and then eventually , she will ask you ...
what' s wrong ?
then you will respond by saying ... ... nothing .
come on , come on .
honey , something must be wrong .
no , nothing .
something is obviously wrong .
no , it' s nothing .
tell me .
please tell me what' s bothering you .
now you got her .
she' s desperate .
hit her right between the eyes .
well , if you must know , i wanna break up .
wait a second .
just like that ?
i call it the passive aggressive bullet to the head .
she feels responsible .
then eventually , she' il squeak out , " but why ?
and then you just look right in her eyes and say , " hey , i don' t love you .
and then you bounce .
wow .
well , it sounds a bit cruel .
it' s less cruel than a bad relationship .
now , i' m gonna give you these .
okay ?
that reminds you who you are .
you' re hard metal .
you' re steel .
i still don' t know why we couldn' t go to your place .
i like the smell of new paint .
drink ?
no , thank you .
you look like you swallowed a spider .
i didn' t just swallow a spider .
a rat ?
no .
wanna know what it is ?
what you swallowed ?
why i am sulking ?
it just looks like you' re constipated .
no .
i explained to you that i was sulking .
because you' re constipated .
when was the last movement ?
it' s not about that .
you want to know what it' s about ?
no .
well , why not ?
because you look so cute .
there' s something on my mind .
something you should know .
philip , rub my leg .
i have a cramp .
don' t you wanna know what' s on my mind ?
rub my leg first .
higher .
higher .
what' s on your mind , big boy ?
let' s go .
it' s open .
you cut your hair .
i know .
no , but i mean , like , you really cut your hair .
i mean , you look like that actress .
halle berry .
no , not halle berry , please .
no .
the actress in that movie about the crack addicts .
that' s who you look like .
like a crackhead ?
it doesn' t matter , because , you know ... ... that' s one hell of a cut .
so , what , you like it ?
no , i hate it .
that' s good .
it makes it so much easier .
i wanna break up .
what ?
yeah .
what ? " i wanna break up .
you can' t break up with me .
i' m supposed to break up with your ass .
well ...
apparently not .
this is so unfair .
this is so completely like you , just totally contrary .
okay , but why you yelling ?
because you wanted to break up with me .
yesterday you wanted to have " the talk . " remember ?
i didn' t want to break up .
you thought i did .
oh , no .
no , no .
okay .
i saw the sulk .
you were sulking when i came in .
that wasn' t a sulk .
it was too a sulk .
your forehead looked like a walnut .
i saw it .
okay , today , i was sulking .
yesterday , total misread .
today , today .
what ?
about the talking .
so why' d you cut the hair ?
to keep you , dumb ass .
this is too confusing .
i' m out .
be gone , nigga .
i don' t care .
who' s keeping you ?
you' re real indignant , considering you stood me up .
i did not .
you stood me up .
it' s good .
i' m leaving .
but you stood me up .
you practically forced me to go out on a date with another guy .
what ?
yeah .
what other guy ?
whoever i was out with , obviously .
where' d you go ?
where we were at .
now you fronting .
you a comedian now ?
it' s good , because i' m up out of here .
how long you been seeing this guy ?
you know what ?
that' s no longer any of your business , now , is it ?
did you do it ?
no , not really .
you' re still together ?
no , he dumped me .
he dumped you ?
wow .
he' s good .
too good .
it doesn' t make sense .
you were perfect .
you should get married .
it makes perfect sense .
his best friend shows up , acts like he doesn' t know who i am .
talks smack about evan to get me all angry , knows all these great lines ... ... and then lies about what he does .
and what does he do ? " you ask .
he masterminds breakups .
it' s obvious .
it is ?
they did the old bait and switch .
i' d slap that ass .
you give it a try .
no .
what are you gonna do about it ?
quincy doesn' t know that i know .
he doesn' t see that i see the connection with evan .
that i know about that stupid book he wrote .
that' s fine and dandy .
i' il keep our little date tonight .
take him down the old romance path .
when he leans in to kiss me , that first awkward kiss of the evening ...
yeah . ... i pull back and laugh .
i' il dump his ass so hard he' il be using a walker .
what ?
it sounds a little childish .
it is not .
okay .
maybe evan will realize how much he' s in love with you ... ... and then you can suggest couple' s counseling or ...
it' s time for my rounds .
we' il talk later .
lay back , mr. lynch .
q.
what you doing here ?
just helping philip .
forget about philip .
your boy got problems .
i know that .
you ready for this ?
i' m in love .
that' s what you said .
no , no .
that was lust .
that was just bump and grinding ... ... talking dirty while i' m spanking that ass lust .
this ...
this is love .
it' s nicky .
right .
i broke up with her today .
strange way to show your love .
i wasn' t in love with her when i did it , okay ?
at least ... ... i didn' t think i was .
was i in love with her when i did it ?
no .
it wasn' t until she told me she was seeing another guy .
that' s what it is .
that' s jealousy .
that ain' t love .
think so ?
of course it' s jealousy , that' s what i' m saying .
why would i be jealous if i wasn' t in love ?
because we trip like that sometimes .
i think i made a big mistake .
i don' t know what to do .
what you think i should do ?
buy her something .
diamond rings , clothes .
here we go .
you' re no help .
credit card .
i need to find the dude , stick my foot up his ass .
he might be big .
might whup your ass .
you know , if it wasn' t for that stupid haircut that she had ...
she cut her hair ?
cut her hair .
can you believe ... ?
women know that' s an aggressive act towards men .
women cut their hair , it' s aggression .
she aggressed me .
no long hair ?
no long hair .
thinks she look like halle berry .
come on .
halle be ...
you know , it' s ...
what' s wrong with you ?
nothing .
i was bubbling .
you know , my stomach is bad .
i ate some of those taquitos ... ... that they had out in the front .
no , i need to go .
where' s a ... ?
i' m gonna go to the bathroom .
nicky ?
so , mary .
is that short for marilyn ?
no .
actually , it' s not .
so why don' t you tell me more about your job as an editor .
actually , you know what i' m trying to do ?
i' m trying to write a book .
like a children' s book .
of course , a book .
it' s called <i>all dogs leave l. a. </ i>
because they can' t get any attention or any love .
where do they go ?
compton .
whatever happened to your sleazy friend and his longhaired girlfriend ?
they broke up .
how' s he taking that ?
feels like he made a big mistake .
does he ?
yeah , they say that honesty is the most important element in love .
oh , i don' t believe that .
i think it' s the most important element in a relationship , but love ... ... doesn' t care about it one way or the other .
what does it care about ?
ltself .
<i>who the hell do you</ i> <i>think you are ? </ i>
we had a deal .
i don' t know what crazy game you think you' re playing ...
<i> ... but you' re out of your league . </ i>
gotta be a wrong number .
safe word : rabbit .
grow up .
listen , mr. watson , if you want more than sex , then damn it , just speak up .
but double dealing ?
totally unacceptable .
you call me back .
these things are pinching me .
i swear , i don' t know who it is .
they gotta have a wrong number .
i don' t know who it is .
i' m out .
some other quincy .
yo , wait , baby .
look , i swear i don' t know who ...
oh , you swear what ?
that you' re honest and forthright ?
is that what you swear ?
mostly , yeah .
get all you need , bro .
get all you need .
she took the day off .
but if there' s anything i could do for you ...
will she be here tomorrow ?
i don' t think so .
i been calling .
she hasn' t called back .
you have the nicest eyes .
thanks .
is there something else i can help you with ?
i like your hat .
i' m so confused .
me too .
what should i do , mr. lynch ?
love me .
and hold your dick , right ?
okay .
is he gone ?
yep .
finally .
i think he' s really , really sorry .
shouldn' t you give him a chance ?
i don' t know .
you two belong together .
how about it ?
if you hate this girl so much , why can' t you break up with her ?
it' s called fear .
don' t get me wrong ... ... she has many fine qualities : beautiful , fun , smart ...
but after a point , you get this feeling of bottomless ruthlessness .
so tell me , you wicked little animal ... ... what is philip offering ?
you tell me .
nothing .
stinko .
zip .
book payback .
book ?
tit for tat .
i can give you tit and tit .
philip gascon ?
but you decide .
you helping philip break up with me , or are you helping me marry him ?
oh , shit .
oh , shit .
what is it ?
i got a cramp .
where ?
it' s in my leg .
well , i' il help you rub it .
here ?
yeah , right there .
that' s where the cramp is .
<i>you' re not even listening to me . </ i>
hello , philip ?
where you at ?
sorry .
look , if something isn' t done soon , i' il be married .
so why you wanna marry philip ?
quincy , quincy , quincy .
i' m a practical girl .
i was brought up dirt poor , wrong side of toledo , by not a very loving family .
i' ve put together a life for myself based on good looks and street savvy .
i figure another five to seven years to cash in .
it' s really all quite simple .
i mean , even the book is theoretical .
just ...
don' t fall in love .
that' s the main thing .
don' t fall in love .
it' s dangerous .
somebody could get hurt .
do you love philip ?
no .
i like him .
he' s nice .
he' s a likable guy .
but women don' t love men they can manipulate .
what about a man that can manipulate you ?
well , if i find one ... ... l' m sure i' il fall in love .
you need to break up with her in public .
do it at the post office , airport .
banks are good .
where there' s security .
but you gotta come on with the come on .
you got to be assertive .
i know , i' ve gotta be assertive here .
yeah .
got to get you ...
i didn' t tell you about the face .
what ?
you know about the face ?
no .
the face of immutability .
see ?
you don' t show emotion , hard for a person to be emotional with you .
this breaks the cycle of facial expressions .
it gives off pain , anger and hurt .
yeah , keep that .
keep that .
keep that .
yeah .
now , when you see her , you act , you don' t wait .
you say , " it' s over .
philip .
what' s wrong with you ?
nothing .
i want to break up .
excuse me ?
yeah , i want to break up .
here ?
yes , here .
why here ?
to avoid violence .
in a post office ?
philip , it' s not you .
i know you .
you' re a fedex man .
yeah , whatever .
well , it' s not possible .
why not ?
because we' re getting engaged .
the hell we are .
look , i thought it all through ... ... and it is the best thing to do .
it is the most generous thing to do .
i don' t want to be generous .
honey , i' m being generous , not you .
listen , let' s face facts , philip .
you are an aging , boring white guy .
without me to define you , you' re invisible .
so in good conscience , the loving person that i am ... ... i could not really just let you go .
i just wanna break up .
of course you do .
listen , we' il get a bottle of wine and you can tell me all about it .
okay ?
come on .
come on .
buck up .
rufus , my darling .
how' s my little baby ?
rufus , it' s me .
helen .
you stop that .
you have something to say to me ?
yeah .
what ?
you ever hear of this game , the question game ?
no .
it' s real simple .
it' s where you ask me a question , i have to answer it truthfully .
i ask you a question , and you have to answer it truthfully .
sounds slightly mean and dangerous .
no .
how about i start it out ?
what' s your name again ?
mary ?
nicky .
your turn .
okay .
what do you do ?
i was an editor at <i>spoil</ i> magazine .
then i wrote this handbook on how to break up with your lover .
how long have you known that ?
first night at the bar .
how long have you known that my name wasn' t mary ?
yesterday .
so you didn' t know that first night ?
hold on .
why' d you go out with me ?
because you thought i looked like halle berry .
who was that woman on the phone ?
i don' t know .
no girlfriend in the shadows with a frying pan ?
nope .
none of that .
do you love evan ?
i thought i did .
once you knew who i was , you planned to stop seeing me ?
i can' t do that .
that' s my cousin .
it' s not right .
but here you are .
here we are .
why is that ?
i' m crazy .
how crazy ?
not a drop of blood .
what' s a girl to think ?
i' m bleeding internally .
wait , wait .
wait , quincy , wait .
wait .
maybe we shouldn' t , quincy .
why ?
you know why .
yeah .
you' re right .
you' re right .
i gotta talk to him .
yeah .
if we have wild sex tonight , it would only complicate things .
yeah , yeah .
it would .
i' m tripping .
i' m gonna go talk to him .
you know what ?
maybe i should just go .
you wanna go ?
you want me to ?
not unless you want to .
i don' t .
don' t go .
then why you bring it up ?
we could play a game .
naked twister .
no , i have a better game .
really ?
the fantasy game .
the fantasy game .
you sit over there .
i' il be over here .
all right .
you tell me one of your favorite fantasies .
and i' il tell you one of mine .
you can go first .
okay .
there' s these baby chickens ... ... and they' re all oiled up .
you go first .
i gotta work mine out .
okay .
i' m asleep ... ... in this ... ... deep , beautiful sleep .
this stranger , he comes into my bedroom .
and his lips ...
and he tastes so sweet ... ... like a now and later .
grape ?
grape .
yeah , grape .
and then his lips are slowly ... ... moving down my body from my neck ... ... to my breasts ... ... to my belly .
i just can barely catch my breath and ...
oh , this ...
it' s like a slow ... ... enormous explosion and ...
get off .
what are you doing ?
what ?
i ...
the dream and the lips .
it was a fantasy .
oh , my ...
god .
you got me excited .
i ...
i was feeling ...
oh , what the hell .
oh , god .
yeah .
didn' t work out , did it ?
somehow it turned into a negotiation .
we started out far apart .
i wanted to break up , she wanted to get engaged .
in the end , we forged a compromise .
what was the compromise ?
we got engaged .
congratulations .
thank you .
so you still want to break up ?
more than ever .
you know i believe in straightforward honesty and direct dealings ?
i have deep respect for your philosophy .
damn all that .
we gonna write a letter .
the letter states you' ve broken up .
hell , i' il even write it .
all right ?
after that , all you do is change your phone numbers , answering machine .
take a vacation for two weeks , somewhere exotic only you know of .
don' t you wanna be somewhere so you can be naked ... ... run on the beach , have fun and frolic ?
frolic all you want , then come back and you change up .
change your habits .
change your schedule for about ... ... six months .
yeah .
yeah ?
well , i can do that .
run naked somewhere , can' t you ?
i' ve got an ass , and i' m gonna show it .
if it' s what you want .

and this is a big gesture .
you think she' s interested ?
i know .
how you know ?
i know .
her friend told me .
no , she didn' t .
she did .
her dude ?
she' s just using some loser to get to me , the real prize .
you think he' s a loser ?
i know he is .
i don' t believe that .
that she' d choose that .

i know nicky , right ?
i see where she' s going with this .
she likes little games , and i play along .
