have you got any biscuits over there ?
here' s some cornbread .
i am cold .
still with us , brett ?
right .
oh , i feel dead .
anybody ever tell you you " look " dead ?
oh , yeah .
right !
i just forgot something , man .
before we dock , i think we ought to discuss the bonus situation .
brett and i , we think we deserve full shares .
mr parker and i feel the bonus situation has never been on an equitable level .
you get what you' re contracted for , like everybody else .
yes , but everybody else gets more than us .
dallas , mother wants to talk to you .
yeah , i saw it .
yellow light' s for my eyes only .
ok , get dressed , huh ?
parker ?
i haven' t finished my coffee .
it' s the only thing good on this ship .
morning , mother .
right ?
ok .
plug us in .
thank you .
where is earth ?
you should know .
it' s not our system .
scan .
i can' t believe this .
contact traffic control .
this is commercial towing vehicle " nostromo " , out of the solomons , registration number 180924609 , calling antarctica traffic control .
do you read me ?
over .
commercial towing vehicle nostromo , out of the solomons .
registration number 180924609 .
nothing .
keep trying .
calling antarctica traffic control .
do you read me , antarctica ?
over .
i' ve found it , just short of zeta ii reticuli .
we haven' t reached the outer rim yet .
that' s hard to believe .
what the hell are we doing out here ?
don' t know .
what the hell are you talking about ?
that' s not our system .
i know that .
do you ever notice how they never come down here ?
this is where the work is , right ?
same reason we get a half share to their one .
our time is their time .
same old shit , man .
i think i know why they don' t come down .
it' s because of you .
you have no personality .
you happen to be in my seat .
can i have it ?
yes .
of course .
sorry .
what' s happening now , baby ?
well , some of you may have figured out we' re not home yet .
we' re only halfway there .
what ?
mother' s interrupted ourjourney course .
why ?
she' s programmed to do that should certain conditions arise .
they have .
it seems she has intercepted a transmission of unknown origin .
she got us up to check it out .
a transmission ?
out here ?
what kind of a transmission ?
acoustical beacon that repeats at intervals of 12 seconds .
sos ?
i don' t know .
human ?
unknown .
so what ?
we are obligated under section ...
i hate to bring this up , but this is a commercial ship , not a rescue ship .
right .
it' s not in my contract , this kind of duty .
and what about the money ?
if you wanna give me some money , i' d be happy to oblige .
let' s go over the bonus situation .
i' m sorry , can i say something ?
there is a clause which states " any systematised transmission indicating intelligent origin must be investigated ...
i wanna go home and party .
parker , will you just listen to the man ?
.. on penalty of total forfeiture of shares .
no money .
well , yeah !
we' re going in .
yeah .
we' re going in .
can we all hear that , lambert ?
good god .
doesn' t sound like any radio signal i know .
maybe it' s a voice .
we' il soon know .
can you home in on that ?
what was the position ?
6550 99 .
all right , it found the quadrant .
ascension : six minutes , 20 seconds .
39 degrees , two seconds .
ok .
put that on the screen for me .
all right .
well , that' s it .
it' s a planetoid .
1200 kilometres .
it' s tiny .
any rotation ?
about two hours .
what about gravity ?
0 . 86 .
you can walk on it .
approaching orbital apogee .
mark .
equatorial orbit nailed .
5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 .
dor' s in line .
status on the lifters ?
give me an ac pressure reading .
48 seconds and counting .
prepare to disengage from platform .
20 seconds .
18 , 17 ... 12 , 11 , 10 , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , lock .
disengage .
clear .
money' s safe .
let' s take her down .
roll 92 degrees , port yaw .
prime the port .
i' m not getting anything .
turbulence .
locked and floating .
you can drop us any time now .
initial damping' s going off .
hold on , people , there' s going to be a little bump .
what the hell was that ?
pressure drop .
must have lost a shield .
let' s go with it .
i' m still not getting anything .
yeah .
dropping off now .
still dropping .
there we are , we' ve got it .
take her down .
navigation lights on .
9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 .
kill drive engines .
what the hell happened ?
somebody give me an answer !
is the hull breached ?
i don' t see anything .
we still have pressure .
push the screen .
why ?
secondary load sharing unit is out .
three of the four cells are gone .
is that it ?
no , hold on .
we can' t fix it out here anyway and we need to reroute a couple of these ducts .
dry dock time .
dry dock .
tell him to dry dock !
we couldn' t fix it out here anyway .
we' ve gotta reroute all these ducts .
in order to do that , we' ve got to dry dock .
what else ?
some fragments caked up .
we' ve got to clean it out and repressurise it .
how long before we' re functional ?
look ...
17 hours , tell her .
at least 25 hours .
get started .
i' il be right down .
what the hell' s she coming down here for ?
she better stay the fuck out of my way .
any response yet ?
no , absolutely nothing , except the same transmission every 12 seconds .
all the other channels are dead .
kick on the floods .
we can' t go anywhere in this .
mother says the sun rises in 20 minutes .
how far to the source of transmission ?
northeast .
just under 2, 000 metres .
walking distance ?
can you give me an atmospheric ?
yes .
it' s almost primordial .
there' s inert nitrogen , high concentration of carbon dioxide crystals , methane ...
i' m working on the trace elements .
anything else ?
yes .
there' s rock , lava base .
deep cold , well below the line .
i' il volunteer to be in the first group to go out .
yeah , that figures .
you , too , lambert .
swell .
you' d better break out the weapons .
i can' t see a goddamn thing !
ash , are you receiving ?
good contact on my board .
clear and free .
keep the line open .
let' s go .
hey , ripley .
hey , ripley , i want to ask you a question .
if they find what they' re looking for , do we get full shares ?
don' t worry , parker , you' il get whatever' s coming to you .
i' m not gonna do any more work until we get this straightened out .
brett , you' re guaranteed by law to get a share .
what ?
why don' t you just fuck off ?
what ?
what did you say , rip ?
if you have any trouble , i' il be on the bridge .
hey , ripley , come back here !
son of a bitch .
what' s the matter ?
can' t see a goddamn thing .
quit griping .
i like griping .
come on , knock it off .
ash , can you see this ?
yes , i can .
i' ve never seen anything like it .
it' s very bizarre .
you said it .
all right .
moving on to second ... position .
what is it ?
let' s get outta here .
we' ve got this far .
we must go on .
we have to go on .
will you say that again ?
shit !
ash , as you can see , it' s hard to describe .
i' m going back to the console .
dallas !
come on down here .
there' s something different here .
i don' t know what it is , but if we can get up that wall , we can find out .
alien life form .
it looks like it' s been dead a long time .
fossilised .
looks like it' s grown out of the chair .
bones are bent outward .
like he exploded from inside .
i wonder what happened to the rest of the crew .
let' s get the hell outta here .
dallas !
lambert !
come on over here !
come on .
what have you got ?
see what you make of this .
it doesn' t look like an sos .
well , i ...
it looks like a warning .
i' m gonna go out after them .
what' s the point ?
i mean , by the time it takes to get there , they' il know if it' s a warning or not .
yes ?
are you ok down there ?
can you see anything ?
i don' t know ...
a cave .
i don' t know , but it' s like the goddamn tropics in here .
what the hell is this ?
the pit is completely enclosed .
and it' s full of leathery objects , like eggs or something .
there' s a layer of mist covering the eggs that reacts when broken .
kane ?
are you all right ?
yeah , i' m ok .
all right .
i' m ok , i just slipped .
it appears to be completely sealed .
wait a minute , there' s movement .
it seems to have life .
organic life .
are you there , ripley ?
i' m right here .
ok , ripley .
i' m at the inner lock hatch .
right .
are you there , ripley ?
we' re clean , let us in .
what happened to kane ?
something attached itself to him .
what kind of thing ?
an organism .
open the hatch !
if we let it in , the ship could be infected .
you know the quarantine procedure .
24 hours for decontamination .
he could die .
open the hatch .
listen to me .
we break quarantine , we could all die .
could you open the goddamn hatch ?
we have to get him inside !
no .
i can' t , and if you were in my position you' d do the same .
ripley , this is an order .
open that hatch , do you hear me ?
yes .
ripley , this is an order !
do you hear me ?
yes .
i read you .
the answer is negative .
inner hatch open .
my god .
what the hell is that ?
jesus christ .
what is that , man ?
hey , how the hell' s he breathing ?
he still alive or what ?
and why don' t you guys freeze him ?
how come they don' t freeze him ?
what' s going on in there ?
what the fuck is going on ?
you bitch !
jesus christ !
hey !
hey !
you were gonna leave us out there !
hey , break it up .
when i give an order , i expect to be obeyed !
even if it' s against the law ?
you' re goddamn right !
she has a point .
who the hell knows what that is ?
how are we gonna get that off of him ?
how are we gonna get it off ?
just a minute !
i' il get some instruments .
right .
now , if i make an incision here to try and remove one of the digits from his face ...
you' re gonna do what ?
finger .
i' il try and get this finger off .
get this cleating on there ...
it' s tearing his scalp !
i know !
it' s not coming off without tearing his face off with it .
we' il have to take a look at him inside .
how come they don' t freeze him ?
how come you guys don' t freeze him ?
you can take your mask off .
what' s it got down his throat ?
i would suggest it' s feeding him oxygen .
paralyses him , puts him in a coma , then keeps him alive .
what the hell is that ?
we' ve got to get it off him .
just a minute .
let' s not be too hasty .
we don' t know anything about ... it .
we' re assuming it' s feeding him oxygen .
if we remove it , it could kill him .
i' il take that chance .
let' s cut it off him now .
you take responsibility ?
yes , yes .
get him out of there .
where do you want to do this ?
we' il make an incision just below the knuckle there .
right here ?
stand by .
good god !
that crap' s gonna eat through the hull .
i think it' s going to eat through the goddamn hull .
come on !
what' s going on ?
this way .
next deck .
there it is .
don' t get under it !
looks like it' s stopping .
take a look at this , man .
brett , give me your pen .
give it to me , quick .
come on , come on !
don' t get any on your arm .
it' s stopped .
i haven' t seen anything like that , except molecular acid .
it must be using it for blood .
it' s got a wonderful defence mechanism .
you don' t dare kill it .
what about kane ?
here' s your pen back .
what do we do now ?
leave kane to ash .
you get back to work .
oh ...
what ... ?
ok .
try it .
damn it .
i felt sure that was it .
try it again .
feel like i' ve been in this place a month .
we shouldn' t have landed here in the first place .
we shouldn' t have landed on this damn ball , i know that .
the sooner we patch this thing up and get outta here , the sooner we can go home .
this place gives me the creeps .
it' s amazing .
what is it ?
i' d say it' s , um ...
i don' t know yet .
do you want something ?
yes , i , uh ...
a little talk .
how' s kane ?
he' s holding .
no changes .
and , uh , our guest ?
well , as i said , i' m still collating , actually .
but i have confirmed that he' s got an outer layer of protein polysaccharides .
he has a funny habit of shedding his cells and replacing them with polarised silicone , which gives him a prolonged resistance to adverse environmental conditions .
is that enough ?
that' s plenty .
what does it mean ?
please don' t do that .
thank you .
i' m sorry .
it' s an interesting combination of elements , making him a ... tough little son of a bitch .
and you let him in .
i was obeying a direct order , remember ?
ash , when dallas and kane are off the ship , i' m senior officer .
oh , yes .
i forgot .
you also forgot the science division' s basic quarantine law .
no , that i didn' t forget .
oh , i see .
you just broke it .
what would you have done with kane ?
hm ?
you knew his only chance of survival was to get him in here .
unfortunately , by breaking quarantine , you risk everybody' s life .
maybe i should have left him outside .
maybe i' ve jeopardised the rest of us , but it was a risk i was willing to take .
it' s a pretty big risk for a science officer .
it' s not exactly out of the manual , is it ?
i do take my responsibilities as seriously as you .
you do yourjob and let me do mine .
yes ?
where' s dallas ?
in the shuttle .
why ?
something' s happened .
serious ?
interesting .
ripley , meet me in the infirmary right away .
where is it ?
well , i don' t know !
we have to try and find it .
let' s check it .
dallas , please be careful .
sorry .
no , not in the corner !
have one of these .
just in case .
kane ?
are you ok ?
i didn' t see it .
was it in the overhead ?
it was up there somewhere .
my god .
cover the damn thing , will you ?
it' s alive .
we' ve got to have a look at this .
excuse me .
it seems dead enough .
good .
let' s get rid of it .
ripley , for god' s sake , this is the first time we' ve encountered a species like this .
it has to go back .
all sorts of tests have to be made .
ash , are you kidding ?
this thing bled acid .
who knows what it will do when it' s dead ?
i think it' s safe to assume it isn' t a zombie .
dallas , it has to go back .
i' d soon as not burn it at the stake , but you' re the science officer .
it' s your decision , ash .
dallas !
you won' t make me change my mind ...
i' m not trying to change your mind .
i just want you to listen ...
will you listen ?
how can you leave that decision to him ?
i just run the ship .
anything scientific , ash has the final word .
how does that happen ?
that' s what the company wants .
since when is that standard procedure ?
standard procedure is to do what they say .
what' s happening with the repairs ?
they' re pretty much finished .
why didn' t you tell me ?
there' s still some things to do .
we' re blind on b and c decks , the reserve power system' s blown ...
that' s horseshit .
we can take off without that .
we can .
you think that' s a good idea ?
look , i just wanna get the hell outta here .
dust in the intakes .
number two' s overheating .
spit on it for two minutes , for christ sake !
we' re hot and we' re getting hotter .
engine room , red clip status .
one kilometre on ascension .
engage artificial gravity .
engaged .
i' m altering the vector ... now .
inhibit cng .
struts retract .
struts retracted .
walk in the park !
when we fix something , it stays fixed .
don' t we , brett , baby ?
right !
we should freeze him .
if he' s got a disease , why don' t we stop it there ?
we can get to a doctor back home .
right .
whenever he says " anything , " you say " right " , brett , you know ?
right .
parker , your staffjust follows you around and says " right " !
just like a parrot .
shape up !
what are you , a parrot ?
right .
come on , knock it off !
kane' s gonna have to go into quarantine .
yes , and so are we .
how about something to lower your spirits ?
thrill me , will you , please ?
according to my calculations , based on time spent ...
give me the short version .
how far to earth ?
ten months .
oh , god .
yes ?
dallas , i think you should see kane .
has his condition changed ?
it' s simpler if you come .
we' re on our way .
right .
how are you feelin ' ?
how are you doing ?
terrific !
next silly question ?
oh , thank you .
do you remember anything about the planet ?
what' s the last thing you do remember ?
i remember some horrible dream about smothering and ...
anyway , where are we ?
right here !
we' re on our way home .
back to the old freezerinos !
i' ve got to have something to eat first .
i need something to eat myself .
one more meal before bedtime .
i' m buying .
hey , that' s a break !
the first thing i' m going to do when i get back is to get some decent food .
i can dig it .
i' ve eaten worse food than this , but then i' ve tasted better .
you pound down the stuff like there' s no tomorrow .
i' d rather be eating something else , but right now , i' m thinking food .
you should know , you know what it' s made of .
i don' t wanna talk about what it' s made of .
i' m eating this !
what' s the matter , man ?
the food ain' t that bad , baby !
what' s wrong ?
what ?
what ?
this is serious .
kane !
get the spoon !
get it into his mouth !
i' m trying !
oh , god !
dallas ?
yeah .
anything ?
no .
you ?
nothing .
did you see anything ?
no .
inner hatch sealed .
anybody want to say anything ?
this is just an ordinary prod , like a cattle prod .
it' s got a portable battery .
it' s insulated from here to here .
just make damn sure nobody puts their hand on the end of it .
it shouldn' t damage the bastard unless its skin is thinner than ours .
but it will give him a little incentive .
now we just have to find him .
i' ve taken care of that .
i' ve designed this tracking device .
you just set it to search for a moving object .
hasn' t got much of a range , but within a certain distance , it gives off a signal .
what does it key on ?
micro changes in air density .
gimme a demo .
see ?
and again ...
gotcha .
two teams .
ash , lambert and i. ripley , you take parker and brett .
catch it , put it in the airlock , get rid of it .
the channels are open on all decks .
i want you to communicate , keep in touch at all times .
let' s go .
i thought you fixed 12 module .
we did .
i don' t understand it .
the circuits must have burned out .
what have we got here ?
damn it , hold your light over here .
yeah , that' s it .
i don' t know if this is going to work .
put this in there .
right .
check the insulation .
shit ...
according to this , it' s within five metres .
micro changes in air density , my ass .
it' s within five metres .
be careful .
hey , don' t creep up on me with that thing .
you guys stick together .
whoa , whoa now ...
what ?
parker , brett , it' s in this locker .
in where ?
here , take it .
i got it , i got it .
wait .
all right , parker ?
when i say .
all right .
now .
easy .
don' t let him go !
what the hell are you doing , man ? !
it' s the cat .
hey , look , now .
we had to bag it .
now we might pick it up on the tracker again .
i' il ...
i' il ...
go and get it , man .
you get him , we' il go on .
here , kitty !
here , kitty , kitty .
kitty crap .
jones !
jonesy ?
here , jonesy !
jonesy ?
here , kitty , kitty , kitty .
here , jonesy !
jonesy ?
here , kitty , kitty .
kitty , kitty , kitty .
jonesy .
kitty , kitty .
kitty , kitty , kitty .
jonesy ?
hey .
hey , come on , jonesy .
come on , baby .
that' s a kitty .
come on , baby .
that' s a kitty .
hey , i' m not gonna hurt you .
come on .
brett !
brett !
brett !
whatever it was , it was big .
no question .
it' s ...
it' s using the air ducts to move around .
could he want brett alive ?
what ?
could brett be alive ?
no .
i mean , i ...
i don' t think so .
now , this air shaft may work to our advantage .
it leads up to and comes out in the main airlock .
there' s only one big opening along the way .
we can cover that up and then we drive it into the airlock and zap it into outer space .
the son of a bitch is " huge !
i mean , it' s like a man .
it' s big !
kane' s son .
come on , ash .
the science department should be able to help .
how can we drive it ?
it' s adapted well to our atmosphere , considering its nutritional needs .
but we don' t know about temperature .
ok , temperature .
what if we change it ?
let' s try it .
most animals retreat from fire .
fire , yeah .
parker , can you rig three or four incinerator units ?
who gets to go into the vent ?
i do .
no .
you and ash , take the main airlock .
parker , lambert , you cover up that maintenance opening , please .
i' m at the firstjunction .
dallas , i' m right here .
parker ?
yeah .
lambert ?
in position .
i' m trying to get a reading .
the airlock is open .
ok , ripley .
ready .
all right , i' ve got a reading on you now .
open the hatch to the third junction .
ok , i' m through .
i' m moving on .
dallas , hold on .
i think i got it .
yes , i' ve got it .
where ?
it' s somewhere around the third junction .
ok .
moving on .
it is right around there .
dallas , you' re gonna have to be careful .
all right .
i' ve reached the third junction and i' m going down .
what the hell' s the matter with that box ?
dallas , hold your position for a minute .
i ...
i' ve lost the signal !
what ?
you sure ?
are you sure it' s not there ?
it' s got to be around there .
check that out , lambert .
you may be getting interference .
dallas , are you sure there' s no sign of it ?
it is there !
it' s gotta be around there !
dallas ?
all right .
am i clear ?
i wanna get the hell outta here .
oh , god !
it' s moving right towards you .
move !
get out of there !
move !
dallas !
move , dallas !
move , dallas .
get out !
no !
not that way !
the other way !
dallas ?
no .
take it easy .
dallas !
we found this laying there .
no blood .
no dallas .
nothing .
i don' t hear anybody sayin ' nothing .
i' m thinking .
unless somebody has got a better idea , we' il proceed with dallas' s plan .
what ? !
and end up like the others ?
oh , no .
you' re out of your mind !
you got a better idea ?
yes .
i say that we abandon the ship .
we get the shuttle and get the hell out of here , and hope somebody picks us up .
lambert , shh .
the shuttle won' t take four .
then why don' t we draw straws ?
i' m not drawing any straws .
i' m for killing it now !
ok .
let' s talk about killing it .
it' s in the air shafts ...
will you listen to me , parker ?
shut up !
let' s hear it .
let' s hear it .
it' s using the air shafts .
we don' t know that ...
that' s the only way !
we' il move in pairs .
we' il go step by step and cut off every bulkhead and vent until we have it cornered , then we' il blow it the fuck out into space .
is that acceptable to you ?
if it means killing it , yeah .
but we have to stick together .
how are our weapons ?
the weapons are fine .
this one needs refuelling .
will you get it , please ?
ash , go with him .
no , i can manage , ash .
don' t follow me .
ash !
any suggestions from you or mother ?
no .
we' re still collating .
you' re what ?
you' re still collating ?
i find that hard to believe .
what would you like me to do ?
just what you' ve been doing , ash .
nothing .
i' ve got access to mother now , and i' il get my own answers , thank you .
all right .
there is an explanation for this , you know .
i don' t wanna hear your goddamn explanation !
parker .
lambert ?
ash !
will you open the door ?
let me by , ash .
what the hell are you doing ?
get her up !
get her up , get her up !
it' s an android !
jesus ...
it' s a robot !
ash is a goddamn robot .
god !
holy shit !
help me get this fucking thing off !
god ...
oh , jesus ...
oh , god .
oh , god .
how come the company sent us a goddamn robot ?
they must have wanted the alien for the weapons division .
he' s been protecting it right along .
parker , will you plug it in ?
um ...
i don' t know ...
because he may know how to kill it .
ash , can you hear me ?
yes , i can hear you .
what was your special order ?
you read it .
i thought it was clear .
what was it ?
bring back life form , priority one .
all other priorities rescinded .
the damn company !
what about our lives , you son of a bitch ? !
i repeat , all other priorities are rescinded .
how do we kill it , ash ?
there' s gotta be a way of killing it .
how do we do it ?
you can' t .
that' s bullshit !
you still don' t understand what you' re dealing with , do you ?
the perfect organism .
its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility .
you admire it .
i admire its purity .
a survivor , unclouded by conscience , remorse , or delusions of morality .
look , i' ve heard enough of this and i' m asking you to pull the plug .
last word .
i can' t lie to you about your chances , but ... you have my sympathies .
we' re gonna blow up the ship .
we' il take our chances in the shuttle .
blow up the ship .
good .
come on .
when we throw the switches , how long do we have ?
ten minutes .
