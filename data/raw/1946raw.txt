forever .
we used to live on the same island in greece when we were kids .
what was he like when he was little ?
little , very little .
that is , compared to me .
i get it , enzo .
you were a superior child .
exactly .
what is it , johana ?
youre so crazy about him , you dont see the truth .
dont think of jacques as a human being .
hes from another world .
and just what world are you from , enzo ?
okay .
and now , my friends , you are invited for a drink around the swimming pool .
today at lunch you asked me ifi had any questions .

no .
it depends .
sometime they are .
what exactly do you want to know ?
everything .
everything about what ?

so between mamma , roberto , and alfredo , we yell and scream all day long .
except with angelica .
she just cries .
and then , finally , we all end up kissing .
can you explain that to me ?
huh ?
because thats what love is all about .
its a pain in the ass ... but it keeps us together .
a large ... and beautiful ...
family .
enzo .
yeah ?
we gotta quit this competition .
why ?
because if we dont im gonna beat you .
do you hear that ?

thats what hes here for .
hes here to lose .
thats what hes here for .
first of all , i am unbeatable .
second ...
how old are you ?
two years younger than you .

youve got tiny lungs .
i still dont understand how you can dive without getting sick .
the size of the lungs has nothing to do with it .

jacques does two hours of yoga before going down !
i can have a five minute nap !
mr. molinari ...
im sorry , but you cannot dive in this state of exhaustion .
what do you know about this ?

i am allowed to be indisposed .

what do those guys do ?
they are paramedics .
they wait at 200 feet .

good dive !
how was it ?
380 feet ... 4 minutes and 50 seconds underwater .
great .
congratulations !
thank you .
thank you very much .
bravo , enzo !
now ...
now ...
im sure youve heard that some people suggest ... it is too dangerous for us to continue .
dangerous because we dont know how to measure ... the physiological consequences of this type of dive .
also because the scuba divers are not used to going down below 300 feet .
but we asked the free divers ... and they all insist that the competition continue .
good luck to you all .
good luck .
sir ...
one minute .
three , two , one .
youre going past here ?
do you see him ?
hey !
do you see him ?

promise .
maybe you shouldnt give up so easily .
heres a present for you .
its your baby .
yeah .

only for the better .
you take care of yourself , johana .
you too .
bye .
thank you .
welcome to greece, jacques .
how are you ?
welcome , johana .
have a good trip ?
okay , let me give you all the information .
come with me .
the smell of fish is making me sick .
why ?
would you get me a glass ofwater ?
are you nervous about the competition ?
whats it feel like when you dive ?
its a feeling of slipping without falling .
the hardest thing is when youre at the bottom .
why ?
cause you have to find a good reason to come back up ... and i have a hard time finding one .
well , we have the same problem .
why ?
because i have a hard time finding a good reason to stay .
i found one .
is he here ?
yeah .
good .
it scares me when you look at the sea like that .
i used to dive here when i was a boy .
i have something i want to talk to you about .
not here .
okay .
can we talk here ?
lets talk about my world .
my world is you .
i love you .
i want to live with you .
i want to have a babywith you .
i want to have a house with you .
a carwith you .
a dog with you .
you know ?
jacques , i think i might be pregnant .
did you hear me ?
god .
tomorrow is going to be a big day .
when i analyzed the data from mayols last dive , it became apparent ... that at the depths these men are diving ... it is a physiological impossibility ... that they can retain enough oxygen in their blood to make it to the surface .
the pressure is so strong ... that it stops the oxygen from circulating through the body .
to attempt to break mayols record now is simple suicide .
do you understand ?
yes , i understand .
but todays just training .
molinaris a 17 time world champion .
three minutes .
do you want to tell him now he cant dive ?
cancel the competition .
two minutes .
get mayol in here .
one minute .
they want to cancel the competition for a while .
why ?
its not safe , they say .
the doctors say ... we cant go deeper and survive .
you say that because you have the title .
no , i would never cheat you .
thats very nice ofyou .
oh , jesus !
i told you to tell him not to go !
its not my fault .
i told him .
no , no , no , no !
and then they die !
wonderful .
get away !
will you get away ?
goddamn it !
get away !
get out !
give him some time .
just leave him alone !
get out !
clear off ! .
you were right .
about what ?
its much better down there .
its a better place .
push me back in the water .
no , i cant .
take me back down .
please .
oh , look !
up with the arms , over the top !
come on , jacques !
lets get a heartbeat .
come on .
come on , jacques !
come on , jacques .
come back , jacques !
come on !
jacques , stay with us !
