nile ,
nile , nile , flowing and swirling river , you are like our queen , the spring of our life .
asterlx and cleopatra
our story begins a long time ago , in alexandria , or at alexandria , both possible ... ... in egypt , the palace from the queen of queens .
the legendary and elegant cleopatra .
enough !
i' m saying that egypt in cultural ways not really ...
i' m not saying there hasn' t been a great period .
i' m just saying your people are nothing special now .
and that egypt is a province of rome .
a " province " !
yes ...
to be clear , o ceasar ... ... it wasn' t the romans that built the pyramids .
those pointy things ?
and the sphinx ?
and the tower of pharaoh' s ?
isn' t that something ?
that' s old stuff .
yesterday ... ... or today , my people are superior .
in fact your people are ... ... greek , and i know better real egyptians than that .
enough !
i can proof , o ceasar ... ... that my people are still genius .
oh ?
how ?
by drawing portrets ?
no , by building a palace .
i already have a palace in rome .
you will get one in alexandria .
if you come to the " province " ... ... you can sleep somewhere .
but it will be bigger ... ... and more luxuary than any other palace .
bigger than " ceasar`s palace " ?
i`d like to see that ...
you will see .
rome wasnt built in one day .
when will it be ready ?
within three centuries ?
three months .
three months ?
three months ?
three ...
... months ?
within three months you will have your palace .
projects are never completed on time .
but ok , i will accept the bet .
if you succeed , i will admit in public ... ... that your empire is the greatest .
but i doubt that will happen .
untill three months ...
hes making me go all the way .
no ... why is the floor done already ?
first the water supply .
now everything will have to be redone .
mr. malococsis , im not an architect .
i only do the tiles .
and whats that door doing there ?
no idea .
ask numrobis , the architect .
architects ...
together with repairmen the biggest frauds .
malococsis !
numrobis ...
im happy to see you .
how are things ?
bad !
wha ... wha ...
whats the problem ?
the door in the ceiling ?
that ?
im anticipating .
if you want a 2nd floor , no problem .
and the tiled floor .
isnt it nice ?
midnightmis , come take a look .
is it beautiful or is it beautiful ?
beautiful .
malococsis ... trust me ... ... im not a repairman .
you are worse .
you are two months behind .
watch it , i know people .
people in high places who can do bad things to you .
regards alexandria ...
architect numrobis ?
no , thats ...
whats it about ?
i was laughing about alexandria ... ... because people in high places make me think about monkeys in trees ...
you dont have to get mad .
my little friend ...
wake up .
breakfast .
kinepolis ...
whats that ?
lovendpis ...
serge ...
amonbofis ... refresh the water .
it smells .
i dont smell anything ...
i made it like we do it always .
thats the problem .
you always do it like that .
yes , we always did it like this .
the floor is weird .
cant touch it .
where is it ?
hello .
numrobis , is egypt the mightiest empire on earth ?
yes .
no one in the world is mightier .
but , ofcourse i dont know everyone .
the romans , especially ceasar , have doubts about that .
iil show him what we are made of .
okay .
i will build the most impressive palace for him .
okay .
and you , numrobis , will be the architect .
okay .
i will be the architect .
that means ?
i will design the whole ...
all my architects are busy .
no , im not busy .
hes not busy .
numrobis , only you are available .
im busy .
i have to finish malococsis building .
only the tiles , but ...
queen , as your architect i offer you my services .
when the crocodiles have fresh water , i can ...
no , you are good , but too classic .
classic ... that means ?
i want something new , something fresh .
but ... help numrobis .
find a piece of land .
land ?
as you wish .
go , numrobis , you have three months .
three months ?
and how much extra time ?
because 3 months , is just enough for the plans ... ... and with the foundations , calculate three times four , nine ...
three months , thats ...
that doesnt seem possible .
numrobis !
you have three months .
exactly !
if you succeed , i will bathe you in gold .
if you fail , i will throw you for the crocodiles .
wheres the sweet little lam ?
did they eat the little lam ?
i had to build that palace .
then cleopatra , the rain ... ... the hail nor the grasshoppers ... ... but i would your worst nightmare of egypt .
17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 ...
474 , 475 , 476 , 477 ...
boss !
boss !
i have been busy a lot ...
i was thinking about some sort of machine ... ... that would help us reach the tip of the pyramids .
otis ... cant this wait ?
what are you counting , boss ?
i am measuring .
cleapatra wants a palace for ceasar .
here .
on this piece of ground .
from there ... to there .
that will get you a huge palace .
it has to be modern and daring .
thats good .
you can stop that ... ... because we have other people for that .
no time , we only have 3 months .
good .
and how many extra time do we get ?
none .
we have 3 months , not a day extra .
weil never make it .
thats right .
but urgent work like this can be interesting .
its not urgent , its suicide .
if i fail , i will be crocodile food .
and i saw them ...
a crocodile is fast .
not good .
now i cant finish my machine .
did you hear me or did you hear me ?
yes , no , but ...
sorry , but i can be eaten .
three months from when ?
from now .
only the gardens will take years .
there is nothing .
totally nothing .
we need magic .
we have to be magicians .
gods .
exactly ...
we need magical powers .
yes , its not good news , but thats it .
when i was little ... ... daddy told me about a druid .
pamo panobemix .
panossonixme ...
something with ix ?
helmutlottix ?
it begins with panob ... and ends with ininekix .
then its pommederainettepommedapix .
a druid .
a druid from gallia with a magic potion .
it gives you enormous powers .
with that potion i will be ready in time and stay alive .
imhotep , i didnt expect it , but i am saved .
boss ... ... magic potions dont exist .
only in papyrus drawings for kids .
take care of the workers .
let them dig the foundations .
there will be a lane with statues .
the " lane with the big statues " .
and over there the garden with olive trees , orange trees , willows , oaks .
yes , and there the palace , luxurious and beautiful .
and a big yard with exotic dancers .
and there a little geranium , yes , it will be nice
it will be very beautiful .
you have to imagine .
yes .
im going .
see you in a month .
a month ?
at the max .
enough time to find panobemix and come back .
ju , cannabis .
ju , cannabis !
go on !
youre standing still , cannabis .
go !
ju , cannabis !
where does that mix live ?
in the north .
he lives in the north .
go , go on , cannabis .
we are in the year 50 before christ .
whole gallia is taken by the romans .
whole gallia ?
no !
an unbeatable village still isnt taken by them .
and life isnt easy for soldiers of the legion .
babaorum , aquarium , laudanum and petibonum .
en garde , gaul .
defend yourself !
im at your service .
what was that ?
are you new here ?
yes , we were just transferred .
i understand .
this drink is a magic potion ... ... made by our druid and it makes us stronger .
look .
panomanix !
panomenixme !
what kind of country is this ?
unbelievable , its minus 8000 here .
i cant drink from it , i fell in it when i was little .
and it gives me unbelievable strength .
look .
isnt it nice ?
hello .
where is the gaul village ?
you should follow them and then its at the end .
im not going with you , ok ?
im staying here .
im going to think for a while .
the romans are good , they fly better than the others .
its because of the helmets .
they are arodynamic .
listen ...
but the landing is kind of hard .
excuse me ?
are you asterixme ?
rix .
asterix . and thats obelix .
and the dogs name is idfix .
do you know panobemix ?
a druid .
panoramix , sorry to disturb you , but you have a visitor .
sir ?
its me !
looks like he doesnt know you .
i , i , i am numrobis .
son of tumris .
what a pleasant surprise .
you must be frozen .
im very happy to see you .
hes from alexandria .
come warm yourself .
is that your magic potion ?
no , chestnut soup .
no .
i cant sell you magic potion .

he never does it .
a little kettle .
no .
a flask .
no .
a little flask .
no .
a bowl .
a little bowl .
a very little bowl , thats it .
its the secret of the druids and we dont trade with it .
a little bowl isnt much .
im sorry numrobis .
its ok .
you were my only hope .
the silk thread my life was hanging on .
but i understand .
you have other stuff to care about .
ceasar , the romans .
who i dont like .
maybe im going to die ...
but im happy i knew you guys .
sir gauls ...
midifix ...
but whats wrong ?
numrobis , wait .
i was planning to ... ... look for manuscripts .
im not promising anything ... ... but i can go with you .
thank you .
thanks a lot , panomanix .
my ship is waiting , enough space for everyone .
we have no time to lose .
come on , idfix .
you wont take him with you ?
why not ?
hes too small for a trip like this .
and egyt is a cat country .
pack your bags and forget about it .
forget it . " " forget it .
with the icy noth wind , on the swordfinfish ... ... the long travel to egypt begins , the land of ra , the son god .
the empire of cleopatra would soon ... ... welcome asterix , obelix and panoramix
and ldfix ?
what ?
im barking .
im not allowed to talk anymore , so i bark .
ok .
get him out , or else he suffocates .
but theres nothing in here .
" nothing in here " .
such a smart dog .
my sweetheart .
hes so sweet .
he wanted to be with me .
he crawled in himself .
we just said ... ... that three months is a little short .
amonbofis is a real hyena .
you know what a hyena is ?
just like him .
he wants me dead and he has a lot of talents .
what can he do ?
no , he is rich .
he has a lot of golden talents .
the egyptian coin .
in gallia the people with the most talents arent rich .
should we fear something ?
no , nothing .
redbeard !
redbeard !
men , we didnt have a lot of luck with those gauls ... ... and their magic potion , and that big guard dog .
they were with so many men , so we couldnt do anything but ...
run .
no , not really .
we had to leave the ship in a hurry .
swimming in thr ice cold water .
no , it was nice water .
it was freezing .
okay .
to get no more trouble , we will stay away from the gauls .
for the others , no mercy !
ship ahead !
ready to board them , daddy .
raise the sails .
take it easy , my child .
besides , you are talking nonsense .
i thought so too .
how many ships , baba ?
one , captain , and it looks small .
egyptian , captain .
egyptian .
egyptian .
that looks good .
with this everything will be fine .
" ipso facto et manu militari " .
woodleg .
on your post .
bosco , floater , frisbee , raise the goats !
skullchicken , rhumsack , hardhead , blow the horns .
ready to board .
i am the king of the world !
pirates !
help , pirates !
look , pirates .
hurry , we have to go .
the pirates .
who are they !
the ga ...
the gau ...
the gua ...
the gauls !
this cant be true .
is there an axe ?
get out of the way .
pardon .
easy down there .
what are they doing ?
cheater !
its not fair .
good .
let your ship go down .
they know who we are .
they are old friends .
we are a lot on the sea together .
see , " one bad thing makes worse things happen " .
ive had enough of your latin proverbs .
whats that in the sky ?
the lights of alexandria .
let the butterflies of my yeuth go down .
i dont know why i said that .
im hungry .
weil be there in the morning .
thats the tower of pharos , a beaken for the ships .
a beaken for ships .
egyptians are crazy .
its a miracle .
the biggest structure made by people .
im more hungry than a barracuda .
bar ra cu da .
you wanted to talk , numrobis .
queen , the palace is going ok but the term is too short .
thats why i asked friends from gallia , a magician and 2 warriors ... ... to help me with my work .
ive come to ask for permission ... ... permission for the help .
help from the verb helping .
i cant decide myself .
surround yourself with anyone you want .
and build the palace within 3 months .
thats all i ask .
ceasar mocks me daily .
i cant afford to lose my status .
hes too arrogant .
too arrogant .
too arrogant .
listen ... ... make sure you will be ready in time and everyone gets gold .
that makes me happy .
or else ... the crocodiles .
that doesnt make me happy .
go now .
mustache is cute .
a bit old .
no , the other one .
no , too fat .
you do it on purpose ?
she has a bad character , but a beautiful nose .
she will feed me to the crocodiles .
very nice .
a little turned up nose , and a pigtail to the side .
iil be crocodile food and hes thinking about her nose .
is crocodile meat nice ?
could you please show some interest in me ?
a big ant .
what a crowd !
it looks like the yearly cattle market in lutetia .
every new breed of cows are shown there .
a big manifestation .
what kind of cows do you have ?
yes , go on .
theres nothing wrong .
yes , there is still a lot to do .
and we only have 2 months left .
about the magic potion , when i was in gallia ... ... you told me you would do would do what was needed .
now id like to know ...
i said i would see what i could do .
why ?
where did all that sand come from ?
it was here already .
all those stones are from the nile and come with the nile express .
hitting slaves is very mean .
they arent slaves .
they are workers ... ... who chose this work and get paid .
and lashes make you pretty ?
no .
yes ... i dont know .
untill now we had no complains .
istou " ?
maybe it means " go on " .
thats the sign for the soup .
no .
they are being relieved .
its a tradition to change hair .
they are hair buddies .
its a different culture .
do you remember the menhir i threw to caius bonus ?
i bet it was as heavy as all those stones .
you should ask him .
i bet he knows .
its a different culture .
another invoice .
i hate those administrative papyrasses .
otis , my writer .
writer , thats a good position ...
in my opinion there are no good or bad positions .
if i have to summarize my life , i begin with the meetings .
with people who helped me , when i was alone .
its funny to say that coincidence determins fate ... ... because when you have the taste of the good ... ... you might not find the right people to talk to .
the mirror that helps you .
thats not my case , because i succeeded .
i thank life ... ... i sing about it , i dance .
i am the love ... ... and if people ask me why i am so humane ... ... i say that i know the taste of love .
and it led me to a mechanical construction .
but maybe tomorrow i will be in service of the community ... ... and give myself .
am myself .
what will we eat today ?
lentils .
iil be back .
the palace of ceasar will be here soon .
58 days .
what are you searching ?
i lost a lentil .
workers .
workers .
comrades .
are we back in the time of the pharaohs ?
are we working hard under lashes again ?
and for whom ?
for caesar ...
that hes constructing his palace in rome .
everyone at his side and the hippos have nothing to worry about .
thats true ...
comrades , you are being exploited .
you are being exhausted ... ... honsetly ...
there .
hes right .
and over there two monumental statues .
but not too munumental 49ft should be enough .
and at the edge of the sphinxes , a big kitchen .
thats next to the chambers , maybe its not ideal .
because of the noise and smell ?
it can be a problem .
i didnt think about that .
what are those big grapes ?
dates , obelix .
they grow on those palm trees .
the middle is crunchy .
thats the seed .
not bad .
end of the break .
time to work !
i didnt say anything .
only that the break was over .
not content !
not content !
excuse me ? yes ...
not content !
not content !
we refuse to work .
not under these conditions .
this is not tolerable .
not content !
calm down please , calm down .
not content !
whos responsible for this ?
okay .
i will be the voice of my comrades .
i am mobilis .
im listening .
you have to new messages .
fistly : we wont work more than 18 hours a day or 36 in 2 days .
we only want 35 hours .
that will never work .
that will lead to problems .
secondly , and sorry for interrupting ... ... we demand a cut of at least 50 % .
an raise you mean .
no .
a cut in the amount of lashes .
we get too many lashes .
some of the workers have a headache of the sound .
their heads are about to burst .
yes ... ... and about the food ...
cant they add some boar to the lentils ?
the less lashes , the slower you work .
and then the palace wont be ready , and i will be crocodile food .
enough , numrobis .
mobilis is right ... ... she cant let them do it .
im sure they would be happy with some wild boar .
ready .
no , you fell in it when you were little .
come , idfix .
give them a demonstration , asterix .
watch it , it might be a bit strong .
its a bit strong .
no , its just right .
idfix , do a trick .
do a trick .
sit !
thats a miracle ...
is there enough for everyone ?
iil make some more .
no , obelix , you ...
fell in the kettle .
yes , alright .
no !
obelix , no .
hohis .
thats his name .
nobis ?
no , hohis .
like saucisse .
nixusis .
how can i be of service ?
an lmhotep .
two .
i have a job for you .
no problem .
who has to die ?
no , were not going to kill anyone .
here you are , two lmhoteps .
the construction of the palace has to stop .
they are waiting for stones from the south .
make sure they wont arrive .
no stones , no construction .
no construction , no palace .
no palace ... ... no palace .
heres some gold to do it .
whats left you will give back .
nice tunic .
i came , i saw , i conquered .
veni , vedi , vici .
the usual formulas .
cezaar " .
cezaar " or " caesar " ?
caesar .
it sounded good , but ...
chisel four blocks .
ave caesar .
respect and power ...
respect and power , caius c+ .
good news ?
i came , i saw , i conquered ?
veni , vedi , thats right .
vici is too soon .
that means ?
in gallia for example ...
whats in gallia ?
in gallia its vici .
totally conquered .
thats not true .
one village unbeatable ... ... and still overpowerd , i know .
i already heard that .
and cleopatra , did the construction stop ?
no , its going good .
its beautiful .
they even have ... on the inside ...
no .
excuse me .
dont touch me .
they will reach their goal .
impossible impossible isnt gallish .
numrobis asked help from three .
one is the druid teachix .
panoramix ?
yes , i knew it sounded like that .
aikix and journalduhix .
or malcomix .
keep your eyes on them and i will see .
si vis pacem , para bellum .
who wants piece , prepares for war .
brucewillix .
meanwhile the ruthless nixusis ... ... sent by amonbofis , finished his assignment .
the stopping of the supply ... ... by bribery of the mean convoy leader .
there the buildings can form a " c " , from cleopatra .
its the palace of ceasar .
thats ok too .
why ?
the stones have arrived .
the leader says there are no more stones in the ridges .
funny language .
he wants his money .
hes lying .
no , he wants to get paid .
no , about the ridges .
there are still stones .
i can make him talk .
may i ?
yes , but dont go too far , he still has to talk .
how do you say " speak " ?
meaning ...
i dont speak egyptian very well " ... ... its " medou ene ere comete " .
if its " speak slower please " , then its " medou ere keteb " .
medou ere keteb " .
no , " ketebece " .
ketebece " .
" keteb " .
ketebece " , when they are with 8 men .
ketebece " .
no , not " ketebece " .
no , sorry .
no one understands you .
keteb " open , " keteb " open handed .
say ...
ouchebe " .
ouchebe " .
no ?
not " ouchebe " ?
no , obelix , not too much .
he says amonbofis paid to throw the stones in the nile .
there are enough stones in the ridges .
ai ...
ai ...
he says ...
yes , ai , i understood that .
he says " ai " because he is in pain .
im in pain .
not the mustache .
not the mustache .
hes done .
weil go with him .
iil stay here at the ship yard .
otis will accompany you for ...
yes , for ...
here .
amulets .
luck bringers that will protect you .
thanks .
amsterisque .
rix .
risque .
yes , rix ...
risque .
the fate of egypt is in your hands .
isnt that a bit too much ?
my fate is in your hands .
better .
go , amsterisque !
rix .
risque .
and then our gallish friends together with otis ... ... went to the ridges to get the stones .
why are you making such weird noises dromedary ?
its my stomach .
while im loading the boat , you can visit the sphinx .
there will also be a lot of restaurants .
you can fill yourself with cookies , pikes ... ... stewed fish and meat with sauce .
i knew it , nothing to eat .
nice , little sphinxes .
i could make little menhirs too .
sphinx !
forget it .
sphinx !
no , thanks .
stranger , a portret with the sphinx ?
a portret in 30 minutes ?
why not ?
nice for on the wall .
do you accept sesterians ?
yes .
and a profile pleae ... ... and the sholders up .
not too much .
we have to be careful .
amonbofis is a snake .
after the transport he migth attack the ship yard .
we should organize some protection .
what do you think , obelix ?
where has he gone now ?
obe ?
obe .

they say its extraordinary .
we have some time .
