it was reaily nice to meet you guys .
do you mind if i take a iittle sliver ?
beauty .
do you want a plate ?
i know what you' re thinking .
where does she put it , right ?
you guys , thanks for the cake .
you didn' t have to do this .
the ieast we could do , seeing as how you worked so hard to become " indispensable " to the company .
is that that new thing cailed sarcasm ?
hal , we aii know you' re about as deep as a puddle .
that used to be part of your charm .
but this just flat out sucks .
what are you talking about ?
if you have one ounce of integrity ieft , you' ii break it off immediately , before you hurt the poor girl .
i gotta give you credit for being more proactive and starting to meet women .
who knows ?
maybe you are on a roii here , but don' t you think it' s time to raise the bar a iittle ?
i mean , at first i thought you were in a slump , you know ?
i could , as a friend , iook the other way while you banged a few fatties and got it out of your system , but there' s iots of good fish out there .
you don' t have to snack on carp any more .
i suppose the girls we partied with a couple weeks ago downtown were a couple of carp ?
no .
laura , the one with the whiskers , she iooked more iike a catfish .
oh , i see .
and what about marie ?
pop some bolts on her neck and the viilagers' ii be chasing her .
and vicki ?
who ?
vicki !
who' s vicki ?
vicki vicki .
with the short brown hair .
vicki ?
i thought that was a guy .
i was cailing her vic !
oh !
you' re out of your mind !
i know i' m being a iittle harsh on you here .
i think reai friends are obligated to be honest with each other .
and this one that you' re dating now jeez .
careful .
hey , aii i' m saying is she' s got cankles , for god' s sake .
what ?
cankles !
she' s got no ankles .
it' s iike the calf merged with the foot , cut out the middleman .
i know what cankles are .
rosemary doesn' t have ' em .
you know what ?
i know what you' re doing here .
you' re scared .
scared ?
yup .
this is exactly what you did with the knockout with the weird toe .
you' re just inventing reasons to dump girls cos you' re afraid .
aii right , iook , i admit rosemary is kind of cool .
but you wouldn' t even be talking to that wooily mammoth if her father wasn' t the president of your company .
what ?
i guarantee you' ve never met anyone iike this guy .
you' re gonna love him .
great .
what' s his girlfriend iike ?
i don' t know .
i haven' t met her .
they just started going out .
oh , there he is .
walt !
at your cervix !
hey , you recognise these panties ?
rosemary , don' t steai my lines .
you two know each other ?
yeah !
gosh , walt' s been volunteering down at the hospitai for years .
oh .
so where' s this mystery girl ?
she should be here any minute .
hey , uh ...
i want you to be honest .
is this outfit too " hey , iook at me " ?
no , no .
it' s ... it' s very subtle .
sorry i' m iate .
tanya .
oh .
what a surprise .
* i' ve spent all summer days drivin '
* i' m tired of holidays ruined
* no more takeaways , expired food ...
i gotta get a map .
i' m going with you .
what are those for ?
you ever walked through a truck stop men' s room on your hands ?
want anything ?
potato chips .
and dip .
cut it out .
so , tanya , i had no idea that you and walt were , you know , seeing each other .
yeah .
you got a iight ?
it' s actuaily a very funny story .
because he had been asking me out for a reaily iong time and i was always kind of unavailable .
and then just when he had given up , i broke up with my boyfriend , and there he was .
so i asked him out .
so he kind of grew on you , huh ?
exactly .
i mean , you gotta admit , when you first meet him , it is kind of jarring .
i mean , you kinda don' t even know what goes where .
but , anyway , the timing couldn' t have been more perfect , because he had just sold his company , and he has aii this time on his hands , and we can plan things and travei and go shopping and ...
weil , i guess timing' s everything .
hope you iike bean dip .
* i' d already picked up all the faces
* and i , l wanna show you all the places
* and i , l wanna take a little ride
* wanna take a little ride , countryside with you
yeah !
that was my girl .
oh , my god .
i' m the biggest nerd .
rosemary !
ralph !
hi .
you remember li' iboy ?
li' iboy .
yeah .
how are you ?
mahalo , rosemary .
how you doing ?
great .
wow .
they stiii got you out in sierra leone ?
no , no .
now they got me nearer my home .
i' m on this island in the south pacific cailed kiribati .
i' m hal .
oh , i' m sorry .
hal .
these are my peace corps buddies .
this is ralph owens and li' iboy .
this is hai larson .
what' s up ?
li' iboy .
so , what are you guys doing up here ?
li' iboy' s been stuck in the office training for 30 days , so i dragged him here and threw him on the slopes .
it wasn' t pretty .
i knew this hawaiian guy in high schooi who went out for the hockey team .
it was funny as shit .
anyway ... it' s great to see you again .
you iook ... happy .
thanks .
i am .
weil , we got a iong drive back , so ...
bye .
bye .
good to meet ya .
you ok ?
uh huh .
it' s just that ...
do you remember how i told you that once i had a boyfriend ?
that was him .
you' re welcome .
what' s your name ?
excuse me , mr robbins .
could i have a word with you , sir ?
sure , but i gotta catch a plane .
it' ii only take a minute .
a few weeks ago , you got trapped in an elevator with a friend of mine .
hal !
he was a great guy .
he was having trouble with his relationships .
how is he ?
weil , that' s a matter of debate .
reaily ?
anyway , apparently , you gave him , iike , a ... pep talk , and now he' s under the impression that he can get any woman he wants .
and you don' t think he can ?
i don' t know .
whatever .
but , see , the point is , iately the only women he wants ... are ugly .
who says they' re ugly ?
bausch & lomb .
and very fat , some of them .
it' s iike hai has iowered his whole ...
jesus , you' ve got a big noggin .
thanks for noticing .
my new book has a chapter on blurting .
you might wanna pick it up .
yeah , i' ii check into that .
anyway , i mean , did something go wrong here ?
or is my friend having a nervous breakdown ?
no .
haven' t you ever heard the phrase " beauty is in the eye of the beholder " ?
yeah .
did you ever hear the song " who let the dogs out " ?
it can' t be that bad .
look , exactly what did you do to him , man ?
i altered his perception a iittle bit .
i knew it .
i knew it !
i knew it !
you messed with his eyesight , right ?
no .
you hypnotised him .
no .
i dehypnotised him .
he' s been hypnotised his whole iife , totaily focused on the outside .
i helped him to see the inner beauty in everyone , including people you think are not physicaily attractive .
how can he see their inner beauty when he doesn' t even know them ?
inner beauty' s easy to see when you' re iooking for it .
but how can he not ... feei them when he' s ... ?
the brain sees what the heart wants it to feel .
aii right , iook .
let' s just cut through the old crapcake here !
ok .
sir , don' t ... don' t you think it' s wrong to brainwash someone ?
don' t you think you' re brainwashed ?
everything you know about beauty is programmed .
tv , magazines , movies .
they' re aii teiling you what' s beautifui and what isn' t .
how' s this any different ?
look , i didn' t come here to debate you !
i just want my friend back !
now , isn' t there some kind of word or phrase or something to take the whammy off him ? !
of course .
but if we do that , he' ii go back to judging everybody by the outside .
is this what he reaily wants ?
i don' t care what he wants !
it' s what i want !
i want my friend back !
i gotta go .
i gotta catch my plane .
i' m reaily sorry .
look , a man' s reputation , dignity and furniture are being trashed here !
perhaps irreparably !
for god' s sakes , his job is in jeopardy !
his job ?
reaily ?
yes .
and it' s a great job .
i just wanted to give him a gift .
i didn' t want him to get hurt .
you seem to know him better than i do , so , um ...
it' s a shame to iet it go .
oh , it' s a tragedy .
so , what did you wanna talk to me about ?
ralph cailed me .
your old boyfriend ralph ?
weil , he was also my division ieader in sierra leone .
anyway , he' s shipping out to kiribati in ten days and he wants me to go with his group .
what ?
you and ralph ?
kiribati ?
they' re in the middle of this economic meltdown .
100, 000 women and children need medicai supplies and food , and they want me to help .
how can you be so selfish ?
sorry ?
i mean , you know what i' m sayin ' .
you bump into pretty boy ralph on friday , the sparks are flying , and now you' re gonna go and save the world in kiribati ?
this has nothing to do with me and ralph .
yeah , right .
he' s obviously crazy about you .
he' s got the heart of a saint .
i could practicaily see the halo around his head .
i can' t compete with that .
ok , first of ail , you' re probably the only person in the free world to ever refer to ralph as a " pretty boy " .
secondly , that halo around his head , it' s cailed psoriasis .
you can' t stand within three feet without getting flaked on .
and thirdly , and fourthly , yes , he' s a great guy and he cares about me , but he had no sense of humour .
and i' m in love with an even greater guy .
weil , then how come i don' t have any say in this thing ?
you do .
that' s why ...
god , are you ok ?
oh , my god .
i am so sorry .
you should be sorry !
this is an outrage !
i' ii go get help .
are you ok , sweetie ?
thank you very much .
i' m so embarrassed .
don' t be .
it' s this flimsy ass four star restaurant .
just sit right here .
i' m gonna go talk to the manager , ok ?
i' ii be right back .
good night .
thank you .
i' m not blaming you , but i need a chair .
my girlfriend' s jinxed when it comes to furniture .
i' m so sorry .
the waiter told me what happened .
just a sec .
mclntosh' s .
heilo ?
shallow hal wants a gal .
what ?
shailow hai wants a gal .
what the heii are you talking about ?
i just saved your iife , baby .
what ?
i' ve been iooking for you aii day .
i' m at mclntosh' s with rosemary .
look , i got kind of a ...
are you iooking right at her ?
no , i' m talking to the hostess .
hal , don' t !
hal ...
look , i got a situation here .
i' ii caii you iater .
look away !
i was just talking to the hostess .
right .
that would be me .
no , no .
it was the other hostess .
sir , i' m the only hostess in the restaurant .
let me apologise about the booth .
we are so sorry .
we' ve replaced your date' s side with a new chair , a strong one , and the meal' s on us .
oh , ok .
weil ... thank you .
you' re welcome .
excuse me .
did you ... did you move us ?
no .
second table on the right .
weil , then maybe you can explain to me why that robust woman is eating my girlfriend' s din ...
hey !
now she' s eating my clams casino !
sweetie , are you ok ?
excuse me .
mclntosh' s .
tiffany .
mm hm .
ok .
we' re two friends walking .
we' re just walking .
and then robbins confirmed exactly what i thought .
which is ?
you weren' t irresistible to women .
he hypnotised you so that reaily ugly girls that you met from then on
would , to you , iook iike supermodels .
what ?
if they had inner beauty or some baloney .
you could get any woman you desired because you were suddenly desiring the undesirable .
you get it ?
no , not exactly .
let me put it this way .
it' s iike he gave you beer goggle iaser surgery .
now wait a second .
so what you' re saying is that aii the pretty girls i' ve met iately are not reaily pretty ?
aii right .
let' s iook at the facts .
they were funny , smart and nice .
pretty girls are not funny !
and they' re certainly not nice .
not to us .
when i found out what robbins was doing , i convinced him to take the trance away .
when i said " shailow hai wants a gal " , you were cured .
you' re out of your mind .
do you know that ?
i' m going back to the restaurant .
hal .
hal , come on .
hey , hal !
you never cailed me back .
what happened to you ?
excuse me ?
oh .
i' ve got my hair back .
it' s me katrina .
we shared the cab together .
i' m in town taking care of my grandma , cos she' s been sick , and ...
oh , wait a minute !
i get it !
nice try , mauricio .
where' d you find this one ?
no , it' s me katrina .
from boston .
the ... the magicai fruit ?
yes , i remember katrina .
but the thing is , you' re not ka ...
i never told you about k ...
katrina !
how the heck are ya ?
give me some sugar .
i didn' t recognise you .
the hair and the ...
you screwed me , man !
i had a beautiful , caring , funny , inteiligent woman , and you made her disappear !
oh , no , i didn' t .
i just made rosemary appear .
there' s a difference .
it' s cailed reality .
hey , if you can see something and hear it and smeii it , what keeps it from being real ?
third party perspective .
other people agreeing that it' s real .
ok , iet me ask you a question .
who' s the ail time love of your iife ?
wonder woman .
ok .
let' s say wonder woman fails in love with you , right ?
would it bother you if the rest of the world didn' t find her attractive ?
not at ail .
cos i know they' d be wrong .
that' s what i had with rosemary !
i saw a knockout !
i don' t care what anybody else saw !
jeez , i never thought about it that way .
hey , i guess i reaily did screw you , huh ?
what am i gonna do ?
hey , hey , don' t panic .
we just get tony robbins back here , he puts the vulcan mind meld on ya and he puts you back under .
good idea .
in the meantime you just avoid rosemary .
why ?
because if you see the reai rosemary , hypnosis is not gonna help you .
you' ii need the jaws of iife to get that image out of your head .
hal , open up .
it' s me .
i hear you in there .
just a sec , rosemary .
what happened to you at the restaurant ?
i got something in my eye .
i had to run back here and flush it out .
yeah , the hostess said that you seemed a iittle cuckoo .
so , come on , open up .
i can' t .
uh ...
let her in .
we' ii club her .
no .
i' m , uh ...
i' m ...
i' m very sick .
i' ve got , uh ... um ...
cc !
you have what ?
contagious conjunctivitis .
i' ii take my chances .
now open up .
aii right .
in a minute .
i told you it was nasty .
are you ok ?
do you need to go to the hospital ?
nah , nah .
i got some drops .
i' ii be fine .
my poor baby .
yeah .
weil , i should probably rack out .
this has taken a iot out of me .
ok .
weil , i' ii caii you in the morning and see how you' re doing .
great , great .
bye bye .
* pop the cork , a champagne glass
* raise to the future , drink to the past
* thank the lord for the friends he cast
* in the play he wrote for you
* and if you love the girl , man , light up a torch
* blaze a trail to her front porch
* kiss her till your lips are scorched
* till the rain comes down on you
* bless your sweet mistakes ...
hal , is everything aii right with you ?
yeah .
yeah , it' s topnotch , sir .
why ?
weil , it' s just that rosemary' s been teiling me that she' s having a bit of trouble getting you on the telephone the iast couple of days .
now , i wouldn' t be working you too hard , would i ?
no .
i mean , i' m working hard , but i guess i' ve just been a iittle preoccupied with things .
but i' ii make sure and touch base with her .
right .
right .
ok , then .
i' m sorry .
apparently tony robbins is a iot tougher to track down than i thought he' d be .
i' ii come through .
i promise .
i can' t keep this up , man .
calm down .
i don' t know , mauricio .
maybe i should just see her .
i mean , i do have ... you know , the heart thing .
maybe that' s enough to overcome her appearance .
it could be iike in that movie the crying game .
when the guy feii in love with a beautifui woman ?
and then when he found out it was a guy , it didn' t matter , cos he already loved her .
hal , if a set of hairy boys was your biggest hurdle here , i' d say go for it .
heilo ?
hey , it' s me .
hey , what' s up , rosemary ?
what happened yesterday ?
hm ?
weil , i stopped by your office to say hi , but you just took off running .
oh , you' re kidding .
no .
what were you doing ?
i was jogging .
in your business suit ?
i had a sweat suit underneath .
oh .
is everything ... ?
what' s going on , hal ?
things haven' t felt the same iately .
no ?
no .
hey , rosemary , don' t worry .
everything ...
i' m just in a iittle funk right now , and everything' s gonna be fine .
yeah .
so , uh ...
i guess i' ii talk to you tomorrow ?
bye .
bye .
* what happened to you ?
* i can t get to you
* cos there' s a wall in your heart
* that no one can get through
* and it s cold and it' s dark
* and you don t have a clue
* but this wall , it will fall
* if it s the last thing i do
* i' il get through
* this wall in your heart
who is it ?
hal , is that you ?
it' s jiil .
comin ' .
hey , what' s up ?
hey .
my girlfriend just bailed on me , and i was wondering if i could take you out to dinner .
i' m sorry .
tonight' s not good .
don' t be such a stiff .
there' s some stuff i wanna talk to you about .
no , reaily , i can' t .
please ?
we' ii go out just as friends .
oh , come on .
you gotta eat , don' t you ?
can i ask you something , jiil ?
yeah .
why the sudden thaw ?
weil , i' ve ...
i' ve been thinking a iot .
hal , i ...
i made a mistake .
i never should have broken it off with you .
weil , you didn' t reaily break it off .
we only had that one date .
besides , you did the right thing .
we didn' t have anything in common , remember ?
but that was my fault .
i shut you out emotionaily .
we could have had more things in common if i' d wanted to .
mr shanahan , how are you this evening ?
how am i ?
tonight i feei iike a thorn amongst a bed of roses .
your table' s ready .
john' ii seat you .
right this way , please .
i' m just gonna go to the iadies ' room .
ok , rosie .
we' ii be at the table .
yeah .
see , why did you shut me out in the first place ?
i' m just curious .
weil , frankly , i guess i ... thought you were shailow .
me ?
yeah .
you struck me as this kind of superficial ... dickwad .
i don' t know .
what do you caii it ?
hal , it' s ok .
i' ve been watching you in the past few weeks .
i' ve seen the women you' ve been out with .
and now i know appearances mean absolutely nothing to you .
if anything , you' re pathologicaily unshailow .
i don' t know about that .
it' s true .
listen , i have an idea .
why don' t we get aii this food to go ?
why ?
because it' ii taste a iot better in bed .
you know , there are a few times in a guy' s iife and i mean two or three , tops when he comes to a crossroads , and he' s gotta decide .
if he goes one way , he can continue what he' s doing and be with any giri who wiii have him , and if he goes the other way , he gets to be with only one woman , maybe for the rest of his iife .
it seems iike by taking the second road , he' s missing out on a iot .
but the truth is , he gets much more in return .
he gets to be happy .
are you wearing panties ?
god !
what am i saying ?
no !
no , i' m sorry .
jiil , this ... this isn' t gonna happen .
i , uh ...
i think i' m gonna go down that other road for once .
hi .
heilo .
heilo ?
hey , hey , hey now .
it' s me , your love bunny .
i miss you and i wanna see you .
what' s the matter ?
you sound upset .
what are you , some kind of psycho ?
heilo ?
rosie ?
just you ieave me daughter alone .
i don' t understand .
the jig is up , and she knows it .
weil , she hasn' t returned my cails .
what' s going on ?
it' s a iittle iate to be worrying about that now , don' t you think ?
besides , she went and accepted that peace corps assignment .
no offence , but i think i have a right to hear this from her .
i' ii give you your rights .
i' ii give you your iast rites , you self righteous iittle shit !
you know , i wanted to iike you .
i truly did .
and aii of that malarkey that you gave me that night at the house .
i bought into it .
in spite of aii me better instincts , i took the hook .
i don' t know .
maybe i share in the blame of it ail .
maybe i just ...
i just wanted to believe that there was stiii a decent guy out there .
a iad that would be right for me daughter .
but , sir ...
don' t speak .
just you iisten !
now , thankfuily , as it turns out , there is a guy out there .
his name is ralph owens .
ral ...
pretty boy ralph ?
don' t be a smart ass .
now you iisten to me .
they' re back together , and me daughter has a chance to be happy .
and you , you' ii be respectin ' that .
* well , i dreamed i saw the knights in armour coming
* saying something about a queen
* there were peasants singin ' and drummers drummin ' ...
excuse me .

um ...
weil , me and rosemary have been having some problems .
i , uh ...
i was reaily stupid .
oh .
weil , why don' t you go buy her a present and then maybe you can make up ?
you were right .
huh ?
in the gym iast week when you said i was scared of women , you were right .
nah , i didn' t mean that .
i was just ...
no , come on , hal .
it' s the truth .
i' m terrified of ' em .
i haven' t been close to a woman ... my whole iife .
i' m a coward , aii right ?
but why ?
i mean , iook at you .
you' re a mountain of a man .
you got more style than mr blackweil .
you' re puiling in what 28 , 29 gs a year ?
29, 500 .
you' re the perfect catch !
i know , i know .
it' s crazy .
i just ... have this thing .
what thing ?
it' s kind of a ... birth defect ... thing .
jeez , man .
i didn' t know .
what is it ?
i have a tail .
huh ?
a tail .
what do you mean , iike a story ?
no , a tail .
it' s iike a waggy tail .
my backbone is ionger than it' s supposed to be .
it' s iike a genetic abnormality .
it' s a vestigiai tail .
you do not .
yeah , i do .
get out !
if i can' t even get my best friend to accept it , how am i supposed to expect a woman to ?
wait a second .
are you for real ?
cos if you are , i gotta see this .
no , you don' t wanna see it .
no , i don' t wanna .
i gotta .
good lord !
aii right , you believe me now ?
oh , man .
it reaily does wag .
only when i' m nervous ... or happy .
wow .
have you ever thought about , you know , maybe getting it cut off ?
cut off ?
i don' t know why i never thought of that ... when i was getting pummeiled in gym class by a bunch of barking seniors !
aii right , calm down , calm down .
god !
the damn thing is wrapped around an artery !
no doctor wiii touch it !
weil ... it' s not so bad .
i guarantee you there are some girls who would think it was adorable .
like a iittle puppy dog .
reaily ?
you think it' s iike a puppy dog ?
it' s cute as a button .
do you wanna ... pet the iittle feila ?
