first fime in history thaf i' d ever missed the bus .
if i had arrived on time , i never would have seen her .
but as it was , i was the first person at huntingfon hills high ... to set eyes on amanda becketf .
it was her first day at school .
then i' m sitting in class , enjoying a late breakfast ... when suddenly , out of all the classrooms in the entire school ... she walks into mine .
and where does the teacher sit her ?
right nexf to me .
now up until now , one could write this off to coincidence ... but then ... she reached into her bag ... and pulled out a strawberry pop tart ... the very same breakfast pastry that i was consuming at that moment .
what was i to do ?
how was i to proceed ?
who would like to volunteer to give amanda a tour of the school ?
i will .

that' s where i lost her .
i had a clear shot , and i hesitated .
but fate' s finally giving me a second chance .

i wonder how william' s doin ' at the party .
i hope he isn' t having any trouble blendin ' in .
wasn' t there somethin ' i was supposed to do tonight ?
i can' t feel my legs .
i have no legs !
can i talk to you for a second , man ?
well , did you do it or what ?
man , we will .
i promise .
but her dad got us all tickets to see pearl jam .
so we' re gonna do it after the concert .
i thought beth can kiss your ass .
come on .
mike , sometimes we say things we don' t mean .
well , when' s the concert ?
august .
you guys suck .
but they' re really good seats .
we' re gonna deal with it eventually !
if you ask me , i never really saw you two together in the first place .
yeah .
you and me both .
what ?
well , i know why i started dating him .
i just don' t know why i did it for so long .
it' s just god , at first , it was all so unbelievable .
and , i mean , at my old junior high school ...
i was always just this little , well , nobody .
and then i came to huntington freshman year ... and mike dexter wanted to date me .
and all of the sudden , i was , like , " little miss popular .
i know it sounds lame , but it felt good .
it' s the first time i' d ever felt cool in my whole life .
please .
it was the first time i' d ever had a boyfriend .
i don' t understand .
i mean , what happened ?
nothing .
see , that' s the problem because mike is the same guy now he was then .
you know , mooning the guy at the drive through window ... giving the underclassmen wedgies .
yeah .
i' ve heard he does that .
so why didn' t you just , you know , break up with him ?
' cause i was , um ... scared of being alone .
mike and i went out for , like , four years .
you know , that' s , like , forever .
and if i' m not mike' s girlfriend , you know , who am l ?
nobody knows me as anything else .
i don' t think i know me as anything else .
look ...
i don' t know about you ... but i really believe ... that there' s one person out there ... for everybody .
that' s what this is about .
it' s not just some sappy love letter telling her ... how my heart stops every time that i see her .
it' s in there , but
it' s not just to tell her how i think she' s more than the homecoming queen ... or mike' s girlfriend or ... how there' s this really amazing person inside of her ... that no one even bothers to see .
it' s in there , too , but ... what it' s really about ... is how she should just give me a chance .
just one chance .
maybe we could find out if there' s a reason for all of this why she' s not with mike tonight ... and after four years , i' m still here with this letter .
maybe we could find out what that reason is .
you know ... it' s time to find out .
i think i' m ready to do this .
finally .
any words of encouragement ?
would you like to touch my penis ?
i am a sex machine .
no one can hear us .
are you satisfied ?
woman , this is all your fault .
bargin ' in here like a freakin ' moose , all
really ?
well , if i' d known you were gonna be in here ... half naked , pleasuring yourself or whatever
don' t touch that .
i definitely would have gone elsewhere .
i was gettin ' my shit ready .
your " shit .
yeah , ' cause for your information ... there is a supermad honey downstairs just waitin ' .
she is dyin ' to have sex with me .
oh , jason , i never should have believed those rumors .
let' s never fight again .
oh , never , baby .
hey , carl .
hey , preston .
what' s up , man ?
how are ya ?
all right .
have you seen amanda beckett ?
yeah .
i just saw her in there .
hey .
did you hear mike dexter broke up with her ?
i' m thinkin ' about askin ' her out .
it' s time to get freaky !
thanks for listening .
god , i got to be prom queen ... and now i want people to feel sorry for me too ?
i should just shut up .
no .
it' s okay .
i mean , you know , you need someone to listen .
thanks .
amanda , i feel really close to you now .
what are you doing ?
oh , well , i care about you .
oh , will you get off ?
come on .
it' s okay , baby !
that is disgusting !
come on .
you were practically begging me for it .
that is not what i was saying .
and you' re my cousin !
through marriage .
whatever !
you' re sick !
shit .

geez .
you' re kenny fisher who got too cool to hang out with me in junior high ...
' cause i was in all the smart classes ... and ' cause my parents didn' t make a lot of money ... and ' cause you desperately needed to sit at the trendy table in the cafeteria .

you' re on the air .
finally .

barry' s listening .
in that song " mandy "
hello ?
why did you do that ?
wait a second .
lady , i was
i was talking to somebody !
no !
you don' t just hang up !
rapid cabs .

i' m at johnny' s on the boulevard .
who are you ?
i was
i' m an angel .
i had so

i think my emergency was just a little bit larger than yours , junior .
how the hell do you know ?
you have no idea how long
this is great .
this is just , just great .
this is officially the worst night of my entire life .
thank you very much .
try having 40 drunk men grabbing your ass ... one groom to be throwin ' up all over you ... and then have your car break down at 2 : 00 a . m .... and then you can talk to me about havin ' a bad night , okay ?
you' re a stripper ?
i' m a dancer .
an angel stripper .
oh , i' m the weirdo .
you' re the one calling barry manilow from a phone booth at 2 : 00 a . m .
you' re right .
i' m a total loser .
no , wait .
i' m sorry .
great .
like i could feel any worse .
that' s the most disgusting thing i' ve ever seen !
what is wrong with you people ?
do you know who preston meyers is ?
duh .
he only sat right next to you in freshman english .
but i guess you wouldn' t remember that .
why would amanda beckett pay attention to a unique spirit like preston ... or even a unique spirit like me , for instance ?
maybe it' s because she' s just a little too busy ... ordering around her little conformist flock of sheep .
sheep !
you are all sheep .
hey , luke doesn' t push vader .
well , he should' ve .
i mean , the guy cut his hand off .
those were our only flashlights .
oh , yeah .
geez .
it' s kinda dark up here .
yeah .
you know what ?
this is just like that scott baio thing .
when i was 16 , i had the biggest thing for scott baio .
you don' t have to sit here and go through scott baio ?
i said i was 16 .
i mean , this went back to the " happy days " years ... not to mention " j oanie loves chachi .
god , i hated her .
joanie .
see , i always knew that somehow ...
i' d meet him .
like if i wanted it bad enough , i could make it happen .
and it did ... right after his first season of " charles ln charge .
he was doing this mall tour , and he came here to our mall .
it was like everything was finally falling into place .
you know , like it was  fate .
yeah !
so i went , you know .
and he had this red bandanna ...
' cause , you know , chachi always wore that red bandanna .
and i waited there outside .
and i was the first person when he pulled up .
he got out of that car
he was so beautiful .
and he looked right at me .
i didn' t know what to do .
i couldn' t say anything .
i couldn' t move .
i never even talked to him , and he was right there .
i still have that red bandanna .
the thing is , you never know .
like , had i at least maybe said something .
you never know .
but anyway , the point is , i totally realized ... you know , fate .
there is fate , but it only takes you so far ... because once you' re there , it' s up to you to make it happen .
you are so definitely right .
i know .
so look .
don' t make the same mistake i did .
if you really want to be with him , get back on that phone ... and call barry manilow and tell him how you feel .
i didn' t want him .
it' s okay .
i don' t think it' s weird .
i mean , come on .
scott baio .
we all have our things .
and i' m ready to fake
a chance again
ready fo put my love on the line
with you

you really want to talk about this while you' re doing that ?
geez , it could' ve been on your mind the last six years .
you might' ve mentioned something .
when ?
when you were ignoring me in the halls ?
when you were writing " denise fleming' s a tampon " on my locker freshman year ?
i did not write " denise fleming is a tampon .
just like you didn' t destroy my cabbage patch kid in second grade .
second grade ?
besides , i admitted that right away .
no , you didn' t .
when i picked her up , her head fell off , you started to cry .
that kind of tipped me off .
i did not cry .
much .
fine .
i told john keiserman to write " denise fleming is a tampon .
i felt really bad afterwards .
it' s all right .
i told ...
diana yellin you were a dendrophiliac .

it' s someone who has sex with trees .
that' s not funny .
