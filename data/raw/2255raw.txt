i am obersturmfuhrer rolf kessel from the ss .
and this is one of my men .
we found him in a ditch with a kitchen knife in his back .
murdered by one of you .
you see the german army retreating , and it makes you feel hope .
it should not .
so who is responsible for this ?
you , priest .
what' s your name ?
i' m father merrin .
father merrin .
these people confess to you ?
yes .
so point out the one who is responsible .
no one here did this , lieutenant .
they aren' t capable of it .
father , you must help me with this .
oh , but how ?
well , i need someone .
do you understand ?
surely there is one among them who beats his wife or his children .
a thief , perhaps .
every town has someone it can do without .
point him out .
there is no murderer here .
i have good news for you .
you are all innocent .
your priest has told me so .
the murderer is no doubt lurking in the countryside ... ... waiting to strike at the next group of german soldiers .
i am going to shoot 10 of you ... ... in the hope that we can demonstrate to this wretch ... ... the responsibility he has incurred .
a worker' s hand .
farmer .
excellent .
no !
we will start with you .
stop !
you have some objection , father ?
in god' s name , you cannot do this .
you choose .
what ?
well , they' re your flock .
you live among them .
so you choose .
i will not .
you give me 10 of them , or i will kill them all .
men , women and children .
shoot me .
you have five seconds .
i can' t .
you can' t what ?
pick who will be sacrificed ?
history is full of priests who did little else .
you begin to irritate me , father .
that was for making me wait .
i still want 10 more names .
what are you doing , father ?
are you praying ?
to god ?
it' s all right , father .
i' il let you pray .
because i know something .
you see ...
... god isn' t here today .
you win .
shoot them all .
no !
wait !
joost harmensz , take him .
too late , father .
you had your chance .
no , please .
take joost .
and jon .
that' s good .
and who shall be next ?
that' s him .
he' s dutch , you say ?
half .
his mother was english .
perhaps he' il be a bit more inclined to see reason then .
i wouldn' t be concerned about reason , major .
he' s a scholar .
we studied his works at the maryknoll center .
oh , yes .
you maryknolls .
cropping up everywhere these days .
it' s a wonder the jesuits don' t get after you for poaching their game .
we all serve in the same cause , major granville .
he' s not one of yours ?
no .
a simple parish priest from holland .
when did he develop this archaeological bent ?
right after the war .
there was an incident .
yes .
yes , i heard .
and his standing in the church now ?
undecided .
the site is right west of lake rudolf , in the turkana district .
it' s early christian , which makes for quite a mystery given its location .
anyway ... ... we won' t know more about it until we get inside the thing .
i' d only uncovered a small portion of the roof before i got ... ... summoned here .
did you feel summoned ?
i am sorry .
it' s a question of status , you see .
my status ?
officially , you' re still listed as a displaced person .
i wonder ... ... why didn' t you take steps ... ... to clear the matter up ?
i' ve been busy .
beautiful , aren' t they ?
yes , very .
are you a lepidopterist ?
a hobby .
from school days .
you have been busy .
six archaeological digs since the war .
this is the longest .
if this is an official matter ... ... then what is he doing here ?
father francis ?
well , for one thing , he' s quite an admirer of yours .
i' m about to begin missionary work in the turkana district .
i thought maybe we could help each other .
you know a lot about the people .
i' d rather not .
thank you .
this is a little awkward .
cardinal jenkins is somewhat concerned ... ... about an exploration of this significance ... ... conducted by a priest who is on sabbatical .
temporary sabbatical .
which comes up for review shortly .
perhaps i should take this up with the governor' s office .
they' d only send you back to me .
why don' t you have a seat , merrin .
you sure you won' t have that drink ?
the cardinal wants to be sure that the site' s religious aspects ... ... are given proper consideration .
part of father francis ' job ... ... will be to see to that .
are you an archaeologist ?
you' re not the sole person with an interest here .
i' ve contacted your sponsors at oxford .
they have no objection .
if you agree as well , i can renew your visa immediately .
we all must make our little deals with the devil , merrin .
before there were the mines , traders came to derati for the water .
they still do ... ... but it is a hard life .
why in god' s name are they tormenting that animal ?
it is a sacrifice .
the new wife of the chief elder ... ... sebituana , will soon give birth .
sebituana does not yet have an heir .
so the people make sacrifices ... ... in the hope that the gods will provide one .
it is a necessary thing .
cruelty is never necessary , chuma .
you think we are savages ?
i think some of you are good people ... ... lost in confusion .
there' s nothing confusing about that ceremony , father .
they' re weakening the bull so that someone can approach it .
and as for some of the turkana being savages , you may want to be careful .
sebituana back there is chuma' s cousin .
welcome back .
did you bring the supplies ?
yes .
they' re in the back of the lorry .
chuma , could you get rachel' s medical supplies ?
here' s a letter for you .
how was nairobi ?
hello .
are you the doctor ?
habari kani , lankester .
it' s good to have you back .
oh , thank you .
your room is prepared .
we' il need another room , emekwi .
this is father francis .
you' re a friend of lankester' s , father ?
oh , hello .
i hope so .
i' ve actually come to open a missionary school .
this is your hotel ?
the finest establishment in derati .
emekwi here , he' s a christian .
maybe he can help you .
in any way i can .
james , joseph .
these are my sons , father .
they shall be your first pupils , if you will have them .
that' s excellent , emekwi .
thank you .
well , then , how far are we from the site ?
merrin .
how old do you think it is ?
well , the architecture seems to date to the fifth century .
the byzantine empire had adopted christianity by then ... ... but they never got this far south .
wanna have a look ?
you' re ?
you' re sure it' s all right ?
well , so long as you don' t touch anything ... ... and keep an open mind .
it must have been an enormous effort to get these materials up here .
up here ?
yes .
the stones come from a quarry near the lake .
which means a distance ...
... of miles .
it' s impossible .
the stones look almost new .
with the wind and sun up here ...
well , they should be badly weathered .
the church must have been deliberately buried right after it was built .
what , they came here and built something only to bury it ?
i don' t know .
chuma , hire some more men .
have them work double shifts .
i want these walls cleared .
i can' t understand it .
who' d reported it ?
except for this .
i cannot thank you enough for your generosity , emekwi .
oh , please , father , the building goes unused .
and besides , it is nothing more than our lord and savior would expect .
if you need anything , anything at all , just ask .
i wish others of our faith felt that way .
oh , but , of course , the town will get the room back soon , since ...
since we have to build a proper school .
oh , please , father .
do not think me a doubting thomas .
but ... ... we may not need that new school right away .
hello , papa .
hello , joseph .
hello , papa .
hello , james .
well ... ... it' s a beginning .
call for the doctor .
it is the heat .
pick him up .
let' s take him down .
i' il get some water .
don' t let him take it all at once .
our friend is back .
cheche .
come for food and water again .
it must be even worse for him in this heat .
i' il try to get him into the tent .
do not let the men see that
don' t be afraid .
you got here quickly .
your man made it sound urgent .
well , is it ?
chuma , try to make him comfortable in the back of my truck .
he needs rest and rehydration .
heat stroke .
you' re working them too hard .
there' s water in the tent if you' d like ...
i would .
thank you .
we had another visit from that boy today .
cheche ?
yes .
any luck ?
couldn' t even get close .
i had to sedate him two weeks ago .
just to treat a beating he took from a villager .
why don' t they help him ?
they think he' s cursed .
what he needs is sustained treatment .
yes ?
nothing .
early this year .
two of the cattle have been killed already .
thank you , chuma .
i must keep you safe for the lady doctor .
cheche .
cheche .
the sores were very infected .
i' ve cleaned and dressed them .
there' s no permanent damage .
the leg and arm are a different matter .
night , mara .
there' s nothing you can do ?
not for the arm .
the leg ...
the leg could be theoretical theoret
theoret ...
theoretically .
theoretically , the leg could be rebroken ... ... and set properly by a surgeon from nairobi .
they fly from ...
do you think he' d allow it ?
it was called chelmno .
that was the polish name .
the germans called it kulmhof .
i was in a processing center for confiscated items .
it' s amazing what you' re capable of when your physical survival is at stake .
things you think you could never endure .
well , nobody knew back then .
everybody ...
we heard stories .
i wish they could fix that generator .
no one wanted to believe .
of course not .
who could believe such things were happening ?
no one wanted to believe .
it' s so much easier to believe evil is random ... ... or an ogre ... ... not that it' s a human condition , something everyone is capable of .
i believed god let us decide between good and evil .
i chose good .
evil happened .
now you travel .
what are you looking for ?
nothing .
sometimes i think the best view of god is from hell .
this boy here ...
you brought something out of that young man .
god is in that boy that doesn' t speak .
until he tried to speak to you .
he' s an unfortunate .
one of god' s afflicted .
i think what you' re looking for , father merrin ... ... is here .
you have been very brave , cheche .
you' re on the mend .
there .
better , eh ?
better .
yes .
better .
merrin was right about you , cheche .
i thought you' d run away .
cheche ... ... if appa and i ...
if we could make your leg better
better .
would you want that ?
we' il have a great deal of news for appa , won' t we ?
merrin , it' s magnificent .
wait till you get inside .
the war in heaven .
st. michael .
it' s so strange .
churches were built to honor god ... ... provide a house of worship , but this ...
this can' t have been a meeting place .
no .
this had to have another purpose .
merrin .
look at the figures .
yes .
church architecture is supposed to reach for the heavens .
but this looks as if as if it were holding something down .
these rocks .
these rocks are like plugs .
what is that ?
like a sarcophagus .
what ?
you hear that ?
yes .
chuma .
bring me some men and the shear legs .
what is it ?
what are you frightened of ?
it' s a temple of some kind .
what idol could inspire a place like this ?
i' d say it' s dedicated to him .
some pagan god of these parts .
chuma ?
the old people would sometimes tell stories ... ... of mountain demons to scare us , but ...
they built the church on top of this .
that' s why they buried it .
to hold this down .
they used st. michael to emphasize ... ... that the old gods had no power before the one .
but i never believed .
these are bloodstains .
people were sacrificed here .
yeah .
it' s almost like a scene out of the inquisition , isn' t it ?
the hyenas must have attacked the cattle .
but the cattle ... ... killed them .
then ate them .
and now they die of it .
he wants you to stop digging .
he thinks the church is evil .
his side of the family ... ... either old ways or nothing .
no argument .
look here .
look how it was done .
the workers who did this were not just not just workers .
they were artists .
the mosaics came from across the world .
here .
the great battle of the angels .
the turquoise from egypt , malachite from namibia ... ... lapis from afghanistan .
extraordinary .
this is st. michael .
it' s his church .
it' s dedicated to him .
but the violence .
it' s the war of heaven .
god' s angels fighting satan and his legion ... ... cast into the underworld .
it' s the sort of find that makes a career .
i thought that at first , but now it seems ...
there is he .
lucifer , source of light .
he was called the most perfect of angels .
it will make you , lankester .
but what will it make you ?
you' re trying to see through me .
are you a head doctor as well ?
it doesn' t take an expert to see you' re suffering .
you' re in guilt .
we' re all in guilt .
what i told you the other night ... ... i never told anyone else .
i told you because of something i saw in you .
merrin .
i' ve got to inform cardinal jenkins .
i hope you understand that if word gets out about what' s in there ... ... the danger of violation and looting which is why we have ... ... to inform major granville as well .
ask him to send a detachment of guards .
because the british have proved so trustworthy .
you haven' t seen the british museum ?
everything was looted from sites like that .
merrin , please .
you' re not the only one involved .
get on , boys .
all right , come on !
come on !
out , out !
welcome , major .
welcome to derati .
fall in on the left , quickly on the right .
fall in and stand easy !
good morning .
good morning .
beloved wherever we go .
sir .
sergeant major , have the men stand to attention .
i have a feeling those good women report to the local aristocracy .
and i don' t want to display even a hint of disrespect ... ... now or at any other time .
am i clear ?
yes , sir .
respect for the godforsaken fuzzies at all times , sir .
that is precisely the sort of comment
squad !
squad , ' tion !
men standing to attention , sir .
thank you .
mix it with blood or water .
it' s for pain .
sebituana' s wife has gone into labor .
she' s in a great deal of pain .
this is dr. lamu .
oh , doctor .
joseph lamu .
rachel lesno .
so good of you to come .
not a problem .
i told them to bring her here , but ...
so i' ve sent some morphine .
what , do you think they count them ?
do you think they count them every night ?
might do .
might do .
you got no more sense than the fuzzies , corporal .
here .
respect the stripes , boy .
oh , " respect the stripes " now , is it ?
i tell you , they got thousands of the things .
just a handful would make us rich for the rest of our lives .
or get us hung .
yeah ?
well , they can' t hang us for having a look , now , can they ?
his wounds are healing well .
i hope we do as well with this .
he' s young .
his bones are strong .
jesus christ !
hundreds of them .
every kind of precious stone .
just a handful is all i need .
all we need , private .
we pool the take .
yeah ?
yeah .
cover them .
sorry , sir ?
they' re british soldiers .
i won' t have them left like that .
of course , sir .
richardson .
avery .
get some blankets and cover those soldiers .
you will keep me informed about cheche ?
yes , of course .
merrin .
merrin .
what' s going on here ?
what do you mean ?
what' s going on here ?
this whole valley .
why don' t you stay a couple of days .
you hardly had any rest .
i' il show you the dig , the church we found .
who' s in charge here ?
military .
major granville .
not you ?
no .
no , not me .
you take care of yourself , lankester merrin .
yes .
thank you .
who , merrin ?
why ?
well , these were on the ground .
they' d been pried out of the mosaics .
maybe they were trying to stop a robbery .
got killed by the thieves .
of course .
bloody savages .
no .
there' s no reason to suspect the turkana , major .
what ?
the style of the killings ... ... the positioning of the bodies .
he' s right .
it' s christian imagery , not pagan .
john the baptist , head on a platter .
peter the apostle crucified a christian is responsible ?
you' re both insane .
merrin .
chuma , get that man out of here .
jomo saw what happened , major .
did he ?
and what was it this jomo saw precisely ?
jomo watches from the hills that lie above this place , and ...
and ?
he says ...
he says he saw the two soldiers argue .
one killed the other and then stabbed himself .
what the devil are you saying ?
they were stealing jewels .
then some sort of madness overtook them
be quiet !
i won' t hear another word !
that is the most ...
