where are his glasses ?
i got it .
are you all right ?
prot ?
you' re okay .
is that apple pie i smell ?
sweetheart , you all right ?
yeah .
he was pushing my daughter on a swing , like he had done a hundred times before .
not like he was some alien from k pax .
i saw him .
he was connecting with something .
some kind of normal life .
that' s not enough .
he' s a violent patient , mark .
he' s not violent .
something violent happened to him .
something in his past .
when he was going after natalie , he wasn' t trying to harm her , he was trying to protect her .
from the sprinklers ?
i' m not sure from what .
i need more than a hunch to go on , otherwise i have to send him upstairs .
we need to regress him take him back into the past , find out what happened and have him confront it .
regress him ?
do you have any idea how risky it is to regress a patient like this one ?
it' s his only chance .
claudia , we have to push him .
there' s no time .
he told me that he' s going back to k pax on july 27 .
that' s in three weeks .
i think that he could become violent on that day .
hurt himself , somebody else .
you know what the problem is , mark .
you' re too close to this patient .
everybody else can see it but you .
i am transferring him to the fourth floor , and that' s final .
i know i' m too close to him .
all right , fine .
i admit it .
why choose this one to save , mark ?
i don' t know .
maybe maybe because i feel ... he chose me .
has anyone seen prot ?
he went up north for a few days .
north " ?
greenland .
iceland .
you know .
he had a few countries left to visit before he could finish his report .
don' t worry , dr. powell .
he' il be back .
how do you know , ernie ?
because he took his glasses with him , darling .
when he returns to k pax , he won' t need them .
patients do not escape from this institution .
they don' t escape .
there has been no evidence of escape , but obviously , i' ve notified the police , social services .
i' m gonna have a great time explaining this to the state board .
i got psychotics on the fourth floor packing up their sneakers ... because they all think they' re going off to k pax .
claudia find him .
well , what about city shelters ?
have you have you checked ?
no .
no , i' m not telling you how to do your job .
uh thank thank you .
dr. powell , i presume .
where the hell have you been ?
newfoundland , greenland , iceland , uh , labrador
all right , cut the crap .
we' ve been looking for you for three days .
i believe i mentioned my taking a trip up north , mark , in this very garden .
taking a trip ?
you' re a patient here .
you don' t leave here without a discharge .
and don' t give me this beam of light shit , because i don' t buy it .
what would you say if i were to tell you ... that i don' t believe you took any trip at all ... to iceland or greenland or anywhere ?
that i don' t believe you' re from k pax ?
i believe you' re as human as i am .
i would say you' re in need of a thorazine drip , doctor .
well , there there is one way ...
you could convince me beyond any doubt .
of course , i would need your consent .
it' s called hypnosis .
i just don' t see the point .
let me tell you what your alternative is .
a trip to a place where they' il stick a needle in your ass every morning , which may or may not leave you with a stupid grin on your face ... for the rest of your days here on earth .
is that what you' d like ?
prot ?
i want to help you .
what we' re going to be doing , prot , is a bit like daydreaming .
i' m gonna count from one to five .
on the count of three , your eyes will close , and you will find yourself in a very nice , deep , comfortable , relaxed state of hypnosis .
one .
your eyes are starting to get very heavy now .
two .
i want you to use your imagination ... and imagine small lead weights on your eyelids ... that are just making them so ... heavy .
pulse rate is 40 b. p. m. three .
keep your eyes closed .
i' d be concerned if he were human .
let yourself go way , way down deep .
four .
let a wave of relaxation move through your body now ... as you go down even deeper .
and five , going way , way down deep .
you are in a relaxed state of hypnosis now .
how do you feel ?
like ... nothing .
i want you to go back in time .
i want you to recall the first experience that you can remember .
what do you see ?
what was that ?
what do you see ?
uh
i see ... casket .
silver ... with a blue lining .
whose casket is it ?
it' s the father of a friend of mine .
what' s your friend' s name ?
i' m not telling .
do you know how your friend' s father died ?
he had an accident at the place that he worked at .
he was killed in an accident ?
he he was hurt and then died later ?
where did he work ?
the place where they kill cows .
where is this place ?
the pulse rate just shot up ten b. p. m. s .
do you know do you know where this place is ?
i i want you to relax .
i want to move forward in time now .
where are you ?
it' s nighttime .
we' re in his house .
at the other boy' s house ?
yeah .
i want him to come outside .
why ?
to look at the stars .
that' s where i come from , you know .
is your name prot ?
wow .
how did you know that ?
where are you from , prot ?
i' m from the planet k pax .
it' s in the constellation lyra .
do you know all the constellations ?
yeah .
most of ' em .
and does your friend know them too ?
yes , he does .
when his dad got sick and had to stay home , they got a telescope , and his dad taught him about all the constellations .
but he' s not interested in those right now .
why not ?
something happened .
that' s why he called me .
he calls me when something bad happens .
like when his father died ?
that' s right .
how do you know to come ?
how does the boy call you ?
i don' t know .
i just come .
i just i just know .
how do you get to earth ?
i wanna go outside .
can i go outside ?
uh , read read his body language , mark .
i i don' t think he wants to talk anymore today .
all right .
prot ?
i want you to just relax now .
think about the stars .
that' s right .
i ' m gonna count backwards now from five to one , and you' il find yourself wide awake and refreshed .
five .
you' re starting to come out of it now .
four .
you' re feeling more alert .
three .
even more alert .
two .
you' re becoming awake now .
and one .
so when do we begin ?
it' s already over .
oh , the old " fastest gun in the west " routine , huh ?
let' s find the locations of all the slaughter houses operating in the united states .
i mean , how many can there be ?
i don' t know .
we eliminate , uh , the ones in or near big cities ... and we concentrate on small towns , rural areas ,
you know , places where you can see the stars .
joyce , we only have six days .
shall i bring the crystal or leave it here ?
i suppose i won' t really need it on k pax .
i don' t even know what they drink .
dream on , sister .
he can only take one of us with him .
why the hell would he take a stinker like you ?
he' s taking me .
how dare you !
i do not stink .
nah , forget it , ho .
i' m the one goin ' .
yeah ?
which one of you ?
okay .
who would like to begin ?
ernie .
uh , i i was i was wondering if it was possible ... for us to have cream of wheat instead of oatmeal .
not again .
howie .
i have a suggestion , because there' s really , really not much time .
i would like to propose an essay contest ... to decide once and for all who will go with prot .
i' ve spoken with him , and he' s agreed to read them all by july 27 .
so if anyone would like to be considered , please state your reasons in a clear , legible hand ... and return them to me .
russell .
yes ?
would i get to take my bible to k pax ?
of course you would .
we can finish the essays later .
now , i want you to go back in time again , but not so far back as last time .
is your friend there ?
is he with you now ?
yeah .
what' s his name ?
i' m not tellin ' .
prot , i would like to know your friend' s name .
well , i ain' t gonna tell ya .
well , we have to call him something .
how about pete ?
well , that' s not his name , but whatever thrills you .
what year is it ?
it' s 1985 .
how old are you ?
one hundred and seventy five .
how old is pete ?
seventeen .
tell me about pete .
what happened ?
is there a problem ?
is that why he called you ?
he' s got a girlfriend .
and the problem is with the girlfriend ?
she' s pregnant .
he can see it all coming right down the road .
you get married , have a bunch of kids , wind up in the same job that killed your dad .
he blames her for this ?
oh , no , no , no .
he doesn' t blame her .
no , he just
he how did he put it ?
he hates the chains that people shackle themselves with .
i mean , we don' t have all that crap on k pax .
all right , prot .
i want you to listen to me carefully .
i want to move forward in time again .
oh , say , two weeks .
you
if you would like to open your eyes or move around , you may .
would you like to ?
i know that .
prot ?
prot , when it' s , uh , 1991 , according to your earth calendar .
and your friend pete called you ?
not for anything in particular .
he just ... sometimes wants to talk things over ... with someone every now and then .
tell me about pete now .
he' s a knocker .
a " knocker " ?
a knocker is the guy that knocks the cow inside of the head ... so it won' t struggle while they slit its throat .
i know .
it' s barbaric , isn' t it ?
does he still live in the same town ?
oh , just outside of town .
he' s got a little place , but he' s fixed it up nice .
it' s got some ... trees and a couple of acres ...
and a river .
it reminds me of k pax , except for the river .
tell me , did he ever marry that pregnant girl ?
wow , what a memory .
yeah , they got married , but she' s no longer pregnant .
why , that was six years ago .
i' ve forgotten her name .
s
i didn' t tell you her name .

he' s fine .
ernie ?
i feel wonderful , dr. powell .

what happened ?
absolutely wonderful .
my good friend howie , he just about strangled me to death .
what ?
son of a bitch , i love him .
ernie , i don' t understand .
you should' ve seen it .
i was asleep .
you know , the way i like my hands tied and everything .
he wrapped something around my neck a handkerchief or something and then tightened it .
there wasn' t a damn thing i could do about it .
well , when i stopped breathing , he lifted me onto the gurney , rushed me up here , and they brought me back as quick as they could .
and when i woke up ,
you know what i realized , dr. powell ?
dying .
dying' s something you have no control over .
why waste your life being afraid of it ?
i' il sleep on my stomach from now on .
i' il eat fish with bones in it .
i' il swallow the biggest pill you can find .
bring it on .
i feel good .
that' s terrific , ernie .
see you at our session tomorrow ?
yes .
i cured him , didn' t i ?
prot says one more task and i' il be cured too .
and then it' s ... bon voyage .

he' s trying to kill himself .
why does he want to kill himself ?
because something terrible has happened .

has he done something he shouldn' t have ?
he doesn' t want to talk about it .
prot , i' m trying to help him .
i can' t help him unless he tells me what happened .
he knows that .
well , then , why won' t he tell me ?
because then you would know ... what even he doesn' t want to know .
then you have to help him , prot .

albuquerque , las cruces , roswell .
wait a minute .

go tojuly27 , 1996 .
' swap meet , livestock sale . '
wait .
go to the 28th .
okay .
there it is !
robert porter .
drowned !
his name ... is robert porter .
robert porter .
ah , here it is .
yeah , i do remember this case .
it was about the biggest thing ever happened around these parts .
he was a quiet type .
as i recall , he was a real smart fella .
kind of brainy .
strong as a horse , though , and worked as a knocker .
lived about 20 miles outside of town with his his wife and child .
sarah .
his wife' s name was sarah .
that' s right .
damn shame what happened .
you got time to take a ride ?
yeah .
well , it' s been empty .
yeah , nobody comes around here much anymore ... since all that happened .
ain' t no livin ' next of kin to give the place to anyway .
i had detectives come down from albuquerque ... to try and piece this one together .
well , accordin ' to the official story ,
porter , he was at work when this , uh , this drifter ,
darryl walker , come by the house .
two time parolee lookin ' for trouble .
you know what i' m sayin ' ?
started out as a robbery .
the wife and the daughter were out back .
sarah ?
sarah ?
from what we can gather from forensics and all , this walker , he , uh he forced the two women into the house .
raped the wife , killed ' em both .
porter , he must' ve come home and found walker still here .
god .
snapped a grown man' s neck like it was a twig .
can' t say i wouldn' t have done the same myself .
uh , the river' s this way .
they found the clothes there .
that' s probably where he jumped in .
and this river can be pretty treacherous .
even in july it' s got a hell of a current .
still , i suppose it might have been a mistake , officially , to declare it a drowning when the body was never found .
doc , if that boy you got back there in new york is really robert porter ,
i' d just as soon not know about it .
know what i mean ?
mark .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
never do that again .
i won' t .
what happened ?
i found what i was looking for .
you sure ?
yeah .
wish i hadn' t .
# and i think it' s gonna be a long , long time #
# till i touch down brings me round again to find #
# i' m not the man they think i am at home #
# oh , no , no , no #
# i' m a rocket man #
if you wouldn' t mind putting mine on top .
# burnin ' out his fuse up here alone #
# and i think it' s gonna be a long , long time #
prot .
have a seat .
you all packed ?
ready to go ?
quite ready .
i travel light .
that' s a joke , mark .
you humans .
there' s just no sense of humour .
i doubt , uh , freud ever tried this , but before someone goes away , we usually like to send them off with a little toast .
scotch okay , or would you prefer something more fruity ?
i will try the scotch .
well , here' s to a ... safe journey .
tell you the truth ,
k pax sounds like a beautiful place .
i' d like to see it sometime .
think there' s a chance of that ?
i think you should see more of your world .
as a matter of fact , i think you should see more of your own family .
invite your son for christmas .
i may just do that , prot .
you know what i' ve learned about your planet ?
there' s enough life on earth to fill 50 planets plants , animals , people , fungi , viruses all jostling to find their place , bouncing off each other , feeding off each other , connected .
you don' t have that kind of connection on k pax ?
nobody wants , nobody needs .
on k pax , when i' m gone , nobody misses me .
there would be no reason to .
and yet i sense that when i leave here ,
i will be missed .
yes .
strange feeling .
you don' t have to leave , prot .
i' m sure there must be some way that i can help you ... to stay as one of us .
i will miss you , dr. powell .
oh .
and i have to finish my report , but ...
i seem to have misplaced my pencil .
take mine .
a much more efficient writing tool .
adios , my friend .
prot ?
i wanna show you something .
that is robert porter .
prot , that' s you .
you and robert porter are the same person .
that' s patently absurd .
i' m not even human .
can' t you at least admit the possibility ?
i will admit the possibility that i am robert porter ... if you will admit the possibility ... that i am from k pax .
now if you' il excuse me ,
i have a beam of light to catch .
oh , mark .
now that you' ve found robert , please take good care of him .
# that nobody can deny #
# that nobody can deny #
# that nobody can deny #
# for he' s a # i can' t stand it .
i i can' t stand this !
i demand to know ... which one of us is goin ' with you .
well , i can tell you this .
there' s extra points for the one who goes to sleep first .
out of my way !
oh , my gosh .
you never gave me my last task .
what' s my last task ?
to stay here .
and be prepared ... for anything .
you look tired , doc .
why don' t you get a few hours of rest ?
he' s not goin ' anywhere .
uh
we got seven hours .
i' il see you in four , hmm ?
get some rest .
you' re gonna eat .
you need some food and you need to sleep .
chow fun .
oh , the place on broadway with the ugly lanterns in the window ?
the mean waiter always shouted at us .
their fortune cookies never had any fortunes in ' em .
we never needed any .
i knew my fortune that night .
he was sitting right in front of me .
hope he still is .
hey .
what' s up , man ?
look , 20 says he goes .
you' re on .
shit !
oh , damn it !
two minutes .
you know where dr. powell is ?
i' il buzz him .
one minute .
here comes dr. powell !
he' s moving .
he' s moving !
what the hell ?
wait for me , you
son of a bitch .
oh , god .
oh , man .
oh , god .
call a code blue .
help me .
let' s get him .
who' s that ?
beats me .
how' d he get in here ?
that' s not prot .
he' s definitely not prot .
certainly not .
prot' s gone .
where' s bess ?
where' s bess ?
bess ?
he chose bess .
bitch !
good bye , bess .
good for you , homegirl .
bess went to k pax .
patient 287 , robert porter .
how i wish i could say that robert sat up one fine day ... and said , " ' i' m hungry .
got any fruit ? '
like most catatonics , he probably hears every word we say ... but refuses or is unable to respond .
nevertheless , i keep him up to date .
let' s see .
i told you about howie .
he got that job at the public library .
and ernie , he' s determined to be a crisis counsellor .
the only one we' re , uh , really concerned about is bess .
you know , we' ve checked halfway houses , shelters , churches , bus stops .
nothing .
uh , we don' t understand .
it' s like ... people don' t just disappear .
july 27th ?
you wouldn' t happen to know anything about that , would you ?
robert ?
no .
well , maybe it' il come to you .
whenever you' re ready , i' il be waiting .
i want to tell you something , mark , something you do not yet know , but we k paxians have been around long enough to have discovered .
the universe will expand , then it will collapse back on itself , and then it will expand again .
it will repeat this process forever .
what you don' t know is that when the universe expands again , everything will be as it is now .
what ever mistakes you make this time around , you will live through on your next pass .
every mistake you make ... you will live through ... again and again , forever .
so my advice to you is to get it right this time around , because this time ... is all you have .
you' re lookin ' great , michael .
think so ?
thanks .
how you doin ' ?
good .
how was your how was your trip ?
was it was it good ?
