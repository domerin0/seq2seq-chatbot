ladies and gentlemen , justice is blind . . . . . . but it can be heard .
and today , the truth wiii come out .
mr. quesada , would you state for the court . . . . . . the sequence of events ieading up to the night of june 30 ?
i stopped off at josie' s bar after work .
i had a few drinks .
angela was there .
she was closing up .
she asked me if i wanted to stick around for some fun .
anything that happened after that was entirely consensual .
are you aware that perjury is a crime , mr. quesada ?
objection .
my client' s a respectable member of the community .
miss sutton has a history of drug  my client' s not on trial .
her testimony is suspect  nor is her testimony suspect .
gentlemen , that' s enough .
the truth is , mr. murdock , is that miss sutton . . . .
miss sutton enjoyed every minute of it .
mr. quesada , for your sake , i hope justice is found here today . . .
. . . before justice finds you .
that' s not right .
another rapist back on the streets .
yeah ?
here' s what i don' t get .
how can a scumbag iike quesada afford an attorney iike hirsh ?
he can' t .
the kingpin' s gotta be footing the biil .
come on .
let' s go get drunk .
not tonight .
i got work to do .
right here .
hey .
what' s up ?
you gotta take that .
big neck , come on .
i can' t believe
what was her name ?
to the justice system , right ?
of course i beat it .
kingpin' s got my back , bro .
how you doing , sweetie ?
boss ?
what' s up ?
what' s up with that ?
is that guy for real ?
yeah , he' s for real .
what do you want ?
justice .
oh , god .
oh , god !
hi .
how you doing ?
didn' t you hear ?
i was acquitted .
not by me .
hey , that iight at the end of the tunnel ?
guess what .
that' s not heaven .
i' ii kiii you !
i' ii kiii you !
that' s the c train .
i' ii kiii you !
oh , god !
hey , you can' t go past there .
caii charlie .
right .
you' re wasting your time , urich .
there' s nothing to see here .
jose quesada .
and the rest of jose quesada .
whole iot of nothing , huh ?
keep running those stories . . . . . . and we' ii end up with copycat vigilantes who' ii get themselves kiiled .
are you here to confirm that daredevii is responsible for this , detective ?
come on , urich .
stop busting my
there is no proof that your so cailed daredevii was involved . . . . . . nor that he even exists .
got it ?
got it .
<i>can one man make a difference ? </ i>

forgive me , father , for i have sinned .
it' s been a week since  what are you playing at , matt ?
you didn' t come here for forgiveness .
you want permission , and i can' t give you that .
justice isn' t a sin , father .
no , but vengeance is .
you see it every day on the streets .
violence just begets more violence .
is that how you want to iive your iife ?
a iawyer during the day . . . . . . and then judge and jury at night .
is that what you want ?
somebody has to do something .
weil , why you ?
because i can .
because i' m not afraid .
weil , i' m afraid for you , matthew .
look , a man without fear is a man without hope .
may god have mercy on you , forgive you and grant you everlasting iife .
amen .
i' m not too crazy about the outfit either .
eyewitnesses say quesada was singled out . . . . . . by the demonic vigilante known as the daredevil .
i don' t know why you read that .
there' s gotta be something to it .
like the ailigators in the sewers ?
there are ailigators in the sewers .
a friend in sanitation has seen them .
fine .
just drop it .
you should see this guy .
they got this picture .
they have a picture ?
it' s a drawing , an artist' s rendering .
it' s just it' s grotesque .
i' d hate to see his therapy biils .
speaking of biils . . . . . . your client , mr. lee , made his first payment .
great .
you should be very happy .
yeah , it' s fantastic .
he paid in fluke .
fluke is a fish .
did you know that ?
i didn' t .
mr. lee is a good man and doesn' t have much money . . . . . . and he fishes on weekends .
i guess it' s
i salsa dance on weekends , but i don' t shake my ass to pay my phone biil .
wiii you pass the honey , please ?
we need better clients .
i' m tired of pro bono cases .
what is your problem with our clients ?
we have good , honorable clients .
what' s your idea of better ?
define " better .
what would be a better client ?
better means rich and guilty , okay ?
law schooi taught us to create a morai vacuum . . . . . . so you can represent people who aren' t innocent .
that was your best course , as i recail .
you don' t have a morai vacuum .
you are completely vacuum iess .

they' re writing about the kingpin .
they' re going back to the beginning .
weil , i' m tired of iooking over my shoulder .

i. . . .
i think i' ii be okay .
i' m not gonna iie and say it doesn' t hurt .
where did you iearn to fight iike that ?
my father .
he had me study with a different sensei every year since i was 5 .
sounds iike he wanted to turn you into some kind of a warrior .
no .
just not a victim .
watch your step .
thank you .
i didn' t even
wait .
how did you do that ?
how did you do the park ?
i don' t know , growing up in the kitchen , a blind kid .
you iearn how to iook out for yourself .
see that ?
he just ran that iight .
i want you to create a paper trail , one that can be traced to natchios .
sir ?
the press want a kingpin .
so i' ii give them a kingpin .
get me builseye .
two out of three .
bloody irish piece of trash .
i said i was sorry .
what do you want ?
details .
you owe me that .
her name' s elektra natchios .
she sounds iike a mexican appetizer .
it' s greek , genius .
her father' s nikolaos natchios .
the biilionaire ?
yeah , see .
yes , the biilionaire .
as your attorney , i advise you to marry her immediately .
i' ii take it under consideration .
susie is my son larry' s daughter by his first marriage .
she eloped with this semi colored feilow from london .
what' s the word for that ?
mulatto .
just iet' s say he had a iittle cream in his coffee .
but he did very weii for himself on the internet .
but don' t ask me how .
no .
you know , they did get me a computer for christmas iast year . . . . . . but i refuse .
i' m afraid it' s going to explode .
but who can afford to fly these days ?
but then my sister marjorie cailed and said she had these frequent flier miles . . . . . . and she couldn' t use them because of her sciatic nerve .
so i said
she' s sleeping .
can i get you anything before we iand ?
more peanuts , please .
yo , taxi !
that' s over on seventh .
you don' t remember me ?
thanks , buddy .
how can you not remember the kingpin ?
no , no , no , no .
please !
no , please , no !
you remember me now ?
what are you , stupid ?
you think you could hold out on the kingpin ?
huh ?
get away from me !
stay out of heil' s kitchen .
this ain' t your neighborhood no more .
kitchen belongs to the kingpin now .
please .
please don' t hurt me .
i' m not the bad guy , kid .
i' m not the bad guy .
i' m not .
i have to caii you back because he just came in .

are you crazy ?
that place is gonna be crawling with rich people .
people who pay iegai fees with money , not with fish .
or with wheels of cheese .
or with sports supplies .
i' m gonna fiii you in on a secret .
this place doesn' t iook iike a iaw office .
it iooks iike the set of <i>sanford and son</ i> .

are you finished ?
we only have an hour to prepare for court .
what' s eating you ?
rough night .
weil , you want to talk about it ?
no .
it' s about elektra , isn' t it ?
no .
natchios owns the grand hotel , and elektra' s the reason you were invited .
she' s out of my ieague , and i' d rather end it before it starts .
that' s gotta be some record .
you just completely bypass the relationship . . . . . . you went right into the breakup .
trying to save some time ?
what happens to that iie detector of yours when it detects your own buil ?
let' s reaily bury the needle , huh ?
swish .
look , matt , seriously , the bail' s in your court .
so does this mean you want a rematch ?
i knew i' d find you .
how did you know i wasn' t a mugger ?
muggers don' t usuaily wear rose oii or high heels .
at ieast this far from chelsea .
come here .
there' s something i wanna show you .
wait a second .
exactly how many women have you brought up here , anyway ?
you' re my first .

this was my favorite view of the city when i was a kid .
i reaily wanted you to see this .
what' s this ?
that' s from my mother .
for good iuck .
it' s beautiful .
it' s a good iuck charm , huh ?
i could use one of those .
do they make them in braiile ?
she gave it to me right before she died .
what happened ?
i should go .
no .
just wait .
no , i' m gonna go  wait , wait , wait .
