and then the war was over .
nobody could go back .
never saw her again .

first time i saw my wife , she was standing on a street corner ... in a uniform , college uniform .
only i didn' t know that' s what it is .
i just thought it was one of your national costumes .
but it was white .
it had high slits up the side .
i' d never seen someone so beautiful before ... in all that ugliness .
then she rode away on her bicycle and i thought i' d never seen her again .
but i found she worked after school in her uncle' s barbershop .
she was a terrible barber .
big feet .
dirty , too .

he was just a baby .
he had the eyes of an old man , even at two months .
or maybe they all droop , we didn' t know .
why you no go back ?
