and that' s why we celebrate thanksgiving ... ... to commemorate the unity between the indians ... ... excuse me ... ... the native americans ... ... and the early english settlers who were called ...
class ?

billboard .

are you steppin ' and he' s fetchit ?
i' m talking about the message .
what it stands for .
it' s called " gentrification .
it' s what happens when property value of a certain area is brought down .
you listening ?
yeah .
they bring the property value down .
they can buy the land cheaper .
then they move the people out , raise the value and sell it at a profit .
what we need to do is keep everything in our neighbourhood , everything , black .
black owned with black money .
just like the jews , the italians , the mexicans and the koreans do .
ain' t nobody from outside bringing down the property value .
it' s these folk !
shooting each other and selling that crack rock and shit .
how you think crack gets into the country ?
we don' t own any planes .
we don' t own no ships .
we are not the people who are flying and floating that shit in here .
every time you turn on a tv , that' s what you see .
black people selling the rock , pushing the rock .
yeah , i know .
it wasn' t a problem when it was here .
wasn' t a problem until it was in iowa ... ... and on wall street where there' s hardly any black people .
if you want to talk about guns ... ... why is it that there' s a gun shop on every corner here ?
why ?
i' il tell you why .
just like there' s a liquor store on every corner in the black community .
why ?
they want us to kill ourselves .
you go out to beverly hills , you don' t see that shit .
they want to us to kill ourselves .
the best way to destroy a people is to take away their ability to reproduce .
who is it that' s dying out here on these streets every night ?
y' all .
yeah .
young brothers like yourselves .
what am i supposed to do ?
fool roll up , try to smoke me ?
i' m gonna shoot the motherfucker if he don' t kill me first .

i ain' t been up this early in a long time .

showed all these foreign places .
how foreigners live and all .
i started thinking , man .
