the world is changed .
i feel it in the water .
i feel it in the earth .
i smell it in the air .
much that once was ... ... is lost .
for none now live who remember it .
it began with the forging of the great rings .
immortal , wisest and fairest of all beings .
great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls .
and nine ... ... nine rings were gifted to the race of men ... ... who , above all else , desire power .
for within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race .
but they were all of them deceived .
for another ring was made .
in the land of mordor , in the fires of mount doom ... ... the dark lord sauron forged in secret a master ring ... ... to control all others .
and into this ring he poured his cruelty , his malice ... ... and his will to dominate all life .
one ring to rule them all .
one by one ... ... the free lands of middle earth fell to the power of the ring .
but there were some who resisted .
a last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of mordor .
and on the slopes of mount doom , they fought for the freedom of middle earth .
victory was near .
but the power of the ring ... ... could not be undone .
it was in this moment ... ... when all hope had faded ... ... that isildur , son of the king , took up his father' s sword .
sauron , the enemy of the free peoples of middle earth , was defeated .
the ring passed to isildur ... ... who had this one chance to destroy evil forever .
but the hearts of men ... ... are easily corrupted .
and the ring of power has a will of its own .
it betrayed isildur to his death .
and some things that should not have been forgotten ... ... were lost .
history became legend ... ... legend became myth .
and for two and a half thousand years ... ... the ring passed out of all knowledge .
until , when chance came ... ... it ensnared a new bearer .
my precious .
the ring came to the creature gollum ... ... who took it deep into the tunnels of the misty mountains .
and there it consumed him .
it came to me .
my own .
my love .
my own .
my precious .
the ring brought to gollum unnatural long life .
for 500 years it poisoned his mind .
and in the gloom of gollum' s cave , it waited .
darkness crept back into the forests of the world .
rumor grew of a shadow in the east ... ... whispers of a nameless fear .
and the ring of power perceived ... ... its time had now come .
it abandoned gollum .
but something happened then the ring did not intend .
it was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable .
what' s this ?
a hobbit .
bilbo baggins of the shire .
a ring .
lost !
my precious is lost !
for the time will soon come ... ... when hobbits will shape the fortunes of all .
the shire ... 60 years later
down from the door where it began
and i must follow if i can
the road goes ever on and on
down from the door where it began
now far ahead the road has gone
and i must follow if i can you' re late .
a wizard is never late , frodo baggins .
nor is he early .
he arrives precisely when he means to .
it' s wonderful to see you , gandalf !
you didn' t think i' d miss your uncle bilbo' s birthday ?
what news of the outside world ?
tell me everything .
everything ?
you' re far too eager and curious for a hobbit .
most unnatural .
well , what can i tell you ?
life in the wide world goes on much as it has this past age .
full of its own comings and goings .
scarcely aware of the existence of hobbits .
for which i am very thankful .
it' s gandalf !
the long expected party .
how is the old rascal ?
i hear it' s going to be a party of special magnificence .
you know bilbo .
he' s got the whole place in an uproar .
well , that should please him .
half the shire' s been invited .
gracious me .
he' s up to something .
oh , really ?
all right , then .
keep your secrets .
before you came along , we bagginses were very well thought of .
indeed .
never had any adventures or did anything unexpected .
if you' re referring to the incident with the dragon , i was barely involved .
all i did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door .
whatever you did , you' ve been officially labeled a disturber of the peace .
oh , really ?
gandalf !
gandalf !
fireworks , gandalf !
gandalf !
fireworks , gandalf !
gandalf ?
i' m glad you' re back .
so am i , dear boy .
so am i.
no , thank you !
we don' t want any more visitors , well wishers or distant relations !
and what about very old friends ?
gandalf ?
bilbo baggins .
my dear gandalf !
good to see you .
111 years old !
who would believe it ?
you haven' t aged a day .
come on , come in !
welcome , welcome .
oh , here we are .
tea ?
or maybe something a little stronger ?
i' ve got a few bottles of the old winyard left .
1296 .
very good year .
almost as old as i am .
it was laid down by my father .
what say we open one , eh ?
just tea , thank you .
i was expecting you sometime last week .
not that it matters .
you come and go as you please .
always have and always will .
you caught me a bit unprepared .
we' ve only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle ...
there' s some cheese here .
no , that won' t do .
we' ve got raspberry jam , an apple tart ...
but not much for afters .
oh , no , we' re all right .
i' ve just found some sponge cake .
i could make you some eggs if you' d ...
just tea , thank you .
oh , right .
you don' t mind if i eat , do you ?
no , not at all .
bilbo !
bilbo baggins !
i' m not at home !
i' ve got to get away from these confounded relatives , hanging on the bell all day ... ... never giving me a moment' s peace .
i want to see mountains again .
mountains , gandalf !
and then find somewhere quiet where i can finish my book .
oh , tea .
so you mean to go through with your plan ?
yes , yes .
it' s all in hand .
all the arrangements are made .
oh , thank you .
frodo suspects something .
of course he does .
he' s a baggins ... ... not some blockheaded bracegirdle from hardbottle .
you will tell him , won' t you ?
yes , yes .
he' s very fond of you .
i know .
he' d probably come with me if i asked him .
i think in his heart , frodo' s still in love with the shire .
the woods , the fields .
little rivers .
i am old , gandalf .
i know i don' t look it , but i' m beginning to feel it in my heart .
i feel thin .
sort of stretched ... ... like butter scraped over too much bread .
i need a holiday .
a very long holiday .
and i don' t expect i shall return .
in fact , i mean not to .
old toby .
the finest weed in the southfarthing .
gandalf , my old friend ... ... this will be a night to remember .
hello , hello .
fatty bolger .
lovely to see you .
welcome , welcome .
go on , sam .
ask rosie for a dance .
i think i' il just have another ale .
oh , no , you don' t .
go on !
so there i was ... ... at the mercy of three monstrous trolls .
and they were all arguing amongst themselves ... ... about how they were going to cook us .
whether it be turned on a spit , or to sit on us one by one , squash us into jelly .
they spent so much time arguing the whithertos and the whyfors ... ... that the sun' s first light crept over the top of the trees ... ... and turned them all to stone !
quickly .
up they go !
no , the big one .
done !
you' re supposed to stick it in the ground .
it is in the ground .
outside !
this was your idea .
watch out for the dragon !
nonsense .
there hasn' t been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years .
that was good .
let' s get another one .
meriadoc brandybuck and peregrin took .
i might' ve known .
speech , bilbo !
speech !
speech !
my dear bagginses and boffins ... ... tooks and brandybucks ... ... grubbs , chubbs ... ... hornblowers ... ... bolgers ... ... bracegirdles ...
... and proudfoots .
proudfeet !
today is my 111th birthday !
happy birthday !
but alas , eleventy one years is far too short a time to live among ... ... such excellent and admirable hobbits .
i don' t know half of you half as well as i should like ... ... and i like less than half of you half as well as you deserve .
i have things to do .
i' ve put this off far too long .
i regret to announce this is the end !
i' m going now .
i bid you all a very fond farewell .
goodbye .
i suppose you think that was terribly clever .
come on , gandalf .
did you see their faces ?
there are many magic rings in this world , and none of them should be used lightly .
it was just a bit of fun .
oh , you' re probably right , as usual .
you will keep an eye on frodo , won' t you ?
two eyes .
as often as i can spare them .
i' m leaving everything to him .
what about this ring of yours ?
is that staying too ?
yes , yes .
it' s in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece .
no .
wait , it' s ... ... here in my pocket .
isn' t that ... ?
isn' t that odd , now ?
yet , after all , why not ?
why shouldn' t i keep it ?
i think you should leave the ring behind .
is that so hard ?
well , no .
and yes .
now it comes to it , i don' t feel like parting with it .
it' s mine .
i found it !
it came to me !
there' s no need to get angry .
well , if i' m angry , it' s your fault !
it' s mine .
my own .
my precious .
precious ?
it' s been called that before , but not by you .
what business is it of yours what i do with my own things ?
i think you' ve had that ring quite long enough .
you want it for yourself !
bilbo baggins !
do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks .
i am not trying to rob you .
i' m trying to help you .
all your long years , we' ve been friends .
trust me as you once did .
let it go .
you' re right , gandalf .
the ring must go to frodo .
it' s late .
the road is long .
yes , it is time .
the ring is still in your pocket .
and he lived happily ever after to the end of his days .
and i' m sure you will , my dear friend .
goodbye , gandalf .
goodbye , dear bilbo .
the road goes ever on and on
until our next meeting .
it' s mine .
my own .
my precious .
riddles in the dark .
bilbo !
bilbo !
my precious .
precious .
he' s gone , hasn' t he ?
he talked for so long about leaving ... ... i didn' t think he' d really do it .
gandalf ?
bilbo' s ring .
he' s gone to stay with the elves .
he' s left you bag end .
along with all his possessions .
the ring is yours now .
put it somewhere out of sight .
where are you going ?
there are some things that i must see to .
what things ?
questions .
questions that need answering .
you' ve only just arrived .
i don' t understand .
neither do i.
keep it secret .
keep it safe .
shire !
baggins !
the year 3434 of the second age .
here follows the account of isildur , high king of gondor ... ... and the finding of the ring of power .
it has come to me .
the one ring .
it shall be an heirloom of my kingdom .
all those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate ... ... for i will risk no hurt to the ring .
it is precious to me ... ... though i buy it with great pain .
the markings upon the band begin to fade .
the writing , which at first was as clear as red flame , has all but disappeared .
a secret now that only fire can tell .
shire .
baggins .
there' s no bagginses around here .
they' re all up in hobbiton .
that way .
good night .
good night .
good night , sam .
is it secret ?
is it safe ?
what are you doing ?
hold out your hand , frodo .
it' s quite cool .
what can you see ?
can you see anything ?
nothing .
there' s nothing .
wait .
there are markings .
it' s some form of elvish .
i can' t read it .
there are few who can .
the language is that of mordor , which i will not utter here .
mordor !
one ring to rule them all ... ... one ring to find them ... ... one ring to bring them all ... ... and in the darkness bind them .
this is the one ring ... ... forged by the dark lord sauron in the fires of mount doom .
taken by isildur from the hand of sauron himself .
bilbo found it .
in gollum' s cave .
yes .
for 60 years , the ring lay quiet in bilbo' s keeping ... ... prolonging his life , delaying old age .
but no longer , frodo .
evil is stirring in mordor .
the ring has awoken .
it' s heard its master' s call .
but he was destroyed .
sauron was destroyed .
no , frodo .
the spirit of sauron endured .
his life force is bound to the ring , and the ring survived .
sauron has returned .
his orcs have multiplied .
his fortress at barad dr is rebuilt in the land of mordor .
sauron needs only this ring to cover all the lands in a second darkness .
he is seeking it .
seeking it .
all his thought is bent on it .
for the ring yearns above all else ... ... to return to the hand of its master .
they are one ... ... the ring and the dark lord .
frodo ... ... he must never find it .
all right .
we put it away .
we keep it hidden .
we never speak of it again .
no one knows it' s here , do they ?
do they , gandalf ?
there is one other who knew that bilbo had the ring .
i looked everywhere for the creature gollum .
but the enemy found him first .
i don' t know how long they tortured him .
shire !
baggins !
shire .
baggins .
but that would lead them here !
who goes there ?
take it , gandalf !
take it !
no , frodo .
you must take it !
you cannot offer me this ring !
i' m giving it to you !
don' t tempt me , frodo !
i dare not take it .
not even to keep it safe .
understand , frodo ... ... i would use this ring from a desire to do good .
but through me , it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine .
but it cannot stay in the shire !
no .
no , it can' t .
what must i do ?
you must leave .
and leave quickly .
where ?
where do i go ?
get out of the shire .
make for the village of bree .
bree .
what about you ?
i' il be waiting for you ... ... at the inn of the prancing pony .
and the ring will be safe there ?
i don' t know , frodo .
i don' t have any answers .
i must see the head of my order .
he is both wise and powerful .
trust me , frodo .
he' il know what to do .
you' il have to leave the name of baggins behind you .
that name is not safe outside the shire .
travel only by day .
and stay off the road .
i can cut across country easily enough .
my dear frodo .
hobbits really are amazing creatures .
you can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month .
and yet , after a hundred years ... ... they can still surprise you .
get down .
confound it all , samwise gamgee !
have you been eavesdropping ?
i haven' t been dropping no eaves .
honest .
i was cutting the grass under the window .
a little late for trimming the verge , don' t you think ?
i heard raised voices .
what did you hear ?
speak !
nothing important .
that is , i heard a good deal about a ring , a dark lord and the end of the world but ...
please , mr. gandalf , sir , don' t hurt me .
don' t turn me into anything unnatural .
no ?
perhaps not .
i' ve thought of a better use for you .
come along , samwise .
keep up .
be careful , both of you .
birds , beasts .
is it safe ?
never put it on ... ... for the agents of the dark lord will be drawn to its power .
always remember , frodo ... ... the ring is trying to get back to its master .
it wants to be found .
this is it .
this is what ?
if i take one more step ... ... it' il be the farthest away from home i' ve ever been .
come on , sam .
" it' s a dangerous business , frodo .
" going out your door .
you step onto the road , and if you don' t keep your feet ... ... there' s no knowing where you might be swept off to .
smoke rises from the mountain of doom .
the hour grows late .
and gandalf the grey rides to isengard ... ... seeking my counsel .
for that is why you have come , is it not ?
my old friend .
saruman .
you are sure of this ?
beyond any doubt .
so the ring of power has been found .
all these long years , it was in the shire .
under my very nose .
yet you did not have the wit to see it .
your love of the halfling' s leaf has clearly slowed your mind .
but we still have time .
time enough to counter sauron if we act quickly .
time ?
what time do you think we have ?
sauron has regained much of his former strength .
he cannot yet take physical form ... ... but his spirit has lost none of its potency .
concealed within his fortress , the lord of mordor sees all .
his gaze pierces cloud , shadow , earth and flesh .
you know of what i speak , gandalf .
a great eye , lidless , wreathed in flame .
the eye of sauron .
he is gathering all evil to him .
very soon , he' il have summoned an army great enough for an assault upon middle earth .
you know this ?
how ?
i have seen it .
a palantr is a dangerous tool , saruman .
why ?
why should we fear to use it ?
they are not all accounted for , the lost seeing stones .
we do not know who else may be watching .
the hour is later than you think .
sauron' s forces are already moving .
the nine have left minas morgul .
the nine ?
they crossed the river isen on midsummer' s eve ... ... disguised as riders in black .
they' ve reached the shire ?
they will find the ring .
and kill the one who carries it .
frodo !
you did not seriously think that a hobbit could contend with the will of sauron ?
there are none who can .
against the power of mordor ... ... there can be no victory .
we must join with him , gandalf .
we must join with sauron .
it would be wise , my friend .
tell me ... ... friend ... ... when did saruman the wise abandon reason for madness ?
i gave you the chance ... ... of aiding me willingly ... ... but you have elected the way of pain !
mr. frodo ?
frodo ?
frodo !
i thought i' d lost you .
what are you talking about ?
it' s just something gandalf said .
what did he say ?
don' t you lose him , samwise gamgee .
and i don' t mean to .
sam , we' re still in the shire .
what could possibly happen ?
frodo .
merry , it' s frodo baggins .
hello , frodo .
get off him .
come on , frodo .
what' s the meaning of this ?
you' ve been into farmer maggot' s crop !
you get back here !
get out of my field !
you know what' s gonna happen when i catch up with you ?
i don' t know why he' s so upset .
it' s only a couple of carrots .
and some cabbages .
and those three bags of potatoes that we lifted last week .
and then the mushrooms the week before .
yes , pippin .
my point is ... ... he' s clearly overreacting .
run !
oh , that was close .
i think i' ve broken something .
trust a brandybuck and a took !
what ?
that was just a detour .
a shortcut .
shortcut to what ?
mushrooms !
that' s mine .
that' s nice , merry .
here' s a nice one , sam .
i think we should get off the road .
get off the road !
quick !
be quiet !
what was that ?
anything ?
nothing .
what is going on ?
that black rider was looking for something .
or someone .
get down !
i have to leave the shire .
sam and i must get to bree .
right .
bucklebury ferry .
follow me .
run !
this way !
follow me !
run !
get the rope , sam !
frodo !
run , frodo !
go !
hurry !
frodo , come on !
come on !
faster !
jump !
how far to the nearest crossing ?
the brandywine bridge .
20 miles .
come on .
what do you want ?
we' re heading for the prancing pony .
hobbits .
four hobbits !
what business brings you to bree ?
we wish to stay at the inn .
our business is our own .
all right , young sir .
i meant no offense .
it' s my job to ask questions after nightfall .
there' s talk of strange folk abroad .
can' t be too careful .
out of the way !
watch where you' re walking .
excuse me .
good evening , little masters .
if you' re seeking accommodation , we got some cozy hobbit sized rooms available .
mister ... ?
underhill .
my name' s underhill .
underhill , yes .
we' re friends of gandalf the grey .
can you tell him we' ve arrived ?
gandalf ?
gandalf .
oh , yes ... ... i remember .
elderly chap .
big grey beard , pointy hat .
not seen him for six months .
what do we do now ?
sam ... ... he' il be here .
he' il come .
get out of my way !
what' s that ?
this , my friend , is a pint .
it comes in pints ?
i' m getting one .
you got a whole half already !
that fellow' s done nothing but stare at you since we arrived .
excuse me .
that man in the corner .
who is he ?
he' s one of them rangers .
they' re dangerous folk , wandering the wilds .
what his right name is , i' ve never heard , but around here he' s known as strider .
strider .
baggins .
baggins .
baggins ?
sure , i know a baggins .
he' s over there .
frodo baggins .
he' s my second cousin , once removed on his mother' s side ... ... and my third cousin , twice removed ...
pippin !
steady on , frodo .
you cannot hide .
i see you .
there is no life ... ... in the void .
only ... ... death .
you draw far too much attention to yourself , " mr. underhill .
what do you want ?
a little more caution from you .
that is no trinket you carry .
i carry nothing .
indeed .
i can avoid being seen if i wish ... ... but to disappear entirely , that is a rare gift .
who are you ?
are you frightened ?
yes .
not nearly frightened enough .
i know what hunts you .
let him go !
or i' il have you , longshanks .
you have a stout heart , little hobbit .
but that will not save you .
you can no longer wait for the wizard , frodo .
they' re coming .
what are they ?
they were once men .
great kings of men .
then sauron the deceiver gave to them nine rings of power .
blinded by their greed , they took them without question .
one by one , falling into darkness .
now they are slaves to his will .
they are the nazgl .
ringwraiths .
neither living nor dead .
at all times they feel ... ... the presence of the ring ... ... drawn to the power of the one .
they will never stop hunting you .
where are you taking us ?
into the wild .
how do we know this strider is a friend of gandalf ?
we have no choice but to trust him .
but where is he leading us ?
to rivendell , master gamgee .
to the house of elrond .
did you hear that ?
rivendell .
we' re going to see the elves .
gentlemen , we do not stop till nightfall .
what about breakfast ?
you' ve already had it .
we' ve had one , yes .
what about second breakfast ?
don' t think he knows about second breakfast , pip .
what about elevenses ?
luncheon ?
afternoon tea ?
dinner ?
supper ?
he knows about them , doesn' t he ?
i wouldn' t count on it .
pippin !
the power of isengard is at your command ... ... sauron , lord of the earth .
build me an army worthy of mordor .
what orders from mordor , my lord ?
what does the eye command ?
we have work to do .
the trees are strong , my lord .
their roots go deep .
rip them all down .
this was the great watchtower of amon sl .
we shall rest here tonight .
these are for you .
keep them close .
i' m going to have a look around .
stay here .
my tomato' s burst .
could i have some bacon ?
want a tomato , sam ?
what are you doing ? !
tomatoes , sausages , nice crispy bacon .
we saved some for you , mr. frodo .
put it out , you fools !
put it out !
that' s nice !
ash on my tomatoes !
go !
back , you devils !
frodo !
oh , sam .
strider !
help him , strider .
he' s been stabbed by a morgul blade .
this is beyond my skill to heal .
he needs elvish medicine .
hurry !
we' re six days from rivendell !
he' il never make it !
hold on , frodo .
gandalf !
mr. frodo ?
he' s going cold .
is he going to die ?
he' s passing into the shadow world .
he' il soon become a wraith like them .
they' re close .
sam , do you know the athelas plant ?
athelas ?
kingsfoil .
kingsfoil , aye , it' s a weed .
it may help to slow the poisoning .
hurry !
what' s this ?
a ranger caught off his guard ?
frodo .
i am arwen i' ve come to help you .
hear my voice ...
come back to the light .
who is she ?
frodo .
she' s an elf .
he' s fading .
he' s not going to last .
we must get him to my father .
i' ve been looking for you for two days .
where are you taking him ?
there are five wraiths behind you .
where the other four are , i do not know .
stay with the hobbits i' il send horses for you .
i' m the faster rider i' il take him .
the road is too dangerous .
what are they saying ?
if i can get across the river ... ... the power of my people will protect him .
i do not fear them .
arwen ... ... ride hard .
don' t look back .
what are you doing ? !
those wraiths are still out there !
give up the halfling , she elf .
if you want him , come and claim him .
no .
no !
frodo , no .
frodo , don' t give in .
not now .
what grace is given me ... ... let it pass to him .
let him be spared .
save him .
where am i ?
you are in the house of elrond .
and it is 10 : 00 in the morning on october 24th , if you want to know .
gandalf !
yes , i' m here .
and you' re lucky to be here too .
a few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid .
but you have some strength in you , my dear hobbit .
what happened , gandalf ?
why didn' t you meet us ?
i am sorry , frodo .
i was delayed .
a friendship with saruman is not lightly thrown aside .
one ill turn deserves another .
it is over .
embrace the power of the ring ... ... or embrace your own destruction !
there is only one lord of the ring .
only one who can bend it to his will .
and he does not share power .
so you have chosen death .
gandalf ?
what is it ?
nothing , frodo .
frodo !
sam .
bless you , you' re awake !
sam has hardly left your side .
we were that worried about you .
weren' t we , mr. gandalf ?
by the skills of lord elrond , you' re beginning to mend .
welcome to rivendell , frodo baggins .
bilbo !
hello , frodo , my lad .
bilbo .
a hobbit' s tale , by bilbo baggins .
this is wonderful .
i meant to go back ... ... wonder at the powers of mirkwood ... ... visit lake town ... ... see the lonely mountain again .
but age , it seems , has finally caught up with me .
i miss the shire .
i spent all my childhood pretending i was off somewhere else .
off with you , on one of your adventures .
but my own adventure turned out to be quite different .
i' m not like you , bilbo .
my dear boy .
now , what have i forgotten ?
packed already ?
no harm in being prepared .
i thought you wanted to see the elves .
i do .
more than anything .
i did .
it' s just ...
we did what gandalf wanted , didn' t we ?
we got the ring this far , to rivendell .
and i thought ... ... seeing as how you' re on the mend , we' d be off soon .
off home .
you are right , sam .
we did what we set out to do .
the ring will be safe in rivendell .
i am ready to go home .
his strength returns .
that wound will never fully heal .
he will carry it the rest of his life .
and yet to have come so far still bearing the ring ... ... the hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil .
it is a burden he should never have had to bear .
we can ask no more of frodo .
gandalf , the enemy is moving .
sauron' s forces are massing in the east .
his eye is fixed on rivendell .
and saruman , you tell me , has betrayed us .
our list of allies grows thin .
his treachery runs deeper than you know .
by foul craft , saruman has crossed orcs with goblin men .
he' s breeding an army in the caverns of isengard .
an army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed .
saruman is coming for the ring .
this evil cannot be concealed by the power of the elves .
we do not have the strength to fight both mordor and isengard !
gandalf ... ... the ring cannot stay here .
this peril belongs to all middle earth .
they must decide now how to end it .
the time of the elves is over .
my people are leaving these shores .
who will you look to when we' ve gone ?
the dwarves ?
they hide in mountains seeking riches .
they care not for the troubles of others .
it is in men that we must place our hope .
men ?
men are weak .
the race of men is failing .
the blood of nmenor is all but spent , its pride and dignity forgotten .
it is because of men the ring survives .
i was there , gandalf .
i was there 3000 years ago ...
... when isildur took the ring .
i was there the day the strength of men failed .
isildur , hurry !
follow me .
i led isildur into the heart of mount doom ... ... where the ring was forged , the one place it could be destroyed .
cast it into the fire !
destroy it !
no .
isildur !
it should have ended that day , but evil was allowed to endure .
isildur kept the ring .
the line of kings is broken .
there' s no strength left in the world of men .
they' re scattered , divided , leaderless .
there is one who could unite them .
one who could reclaim the throne of gondor .
he turned from that path a long time ago .
he has chosen exile .
the shards of narsil .
the blade that cut the ring from sauron' s hand .
it' s still sharp .
but no more than a broken heirloom .
why do you fear the past ?
you are isildur' s heir , not isildur himself .
you are not bound to his fate .
the same blood flows in my veins .
the same weakness .
your time will come .
you will face the same evil .
and you will defeat it .
the shadow does not hold sway yet .
not over you ... not over me .
do you remember when we first met ?
i thought i had strayed into a dream .
long years have passed .
you did not have the cares you carry now .
do you remember what i told you ?
you said you' d bind yourself to me ... ... forsaking the immortal life of your people .
and to that i hold .
i would rather share one lifetime with you ... ... than face all the ages of this world alone .
i choose a mortal life .
you cannot give me this .
it is mine to give to whom i will ...
... like my heart .
strangers from distant lands , friends of old ... ... you' ve been summoned here to answer the threat of mordor .
middle earth stands upon the brink of destruction .
none can escape it .
you will unite , or you will fall .
each race is bound to this fate , this one doom .
bring forth the ring , frodo .
so it is true .
the doom of man .
it is a gift .
a gift to the foes of mordor .
why not use this ring ?
long has my father , the steward of gondor ... ... kept the forces of mordor at bay .
by the blood of our people ... ... are your lands kept safe .
give gondor the weapon of the enemy .
let us use it against him .
you cannot wield it .
none of us can .
the one ring answers to sauron alone .
it has no other master .
and what would a ranger know of this matter ?
this is no mere ranger .
he is aragorn , son of arathorn .
you owe him your allegiance .
aragorn .
this is isildur' s heir ?
and heir to the throne of gondor .
sit down , legolas .
gondor has no king .
gondor needs no king .
aragorn is right .
we cannot use it .
you have only one choice .
the ring must be destroyed .
what are we waiting for ?
the ring cannot be destroyed , gimli , son of glin ... ... by any craft that we here possess .
the ring was made in the fires of mount doom .
only there can it be unmade .
it must be taken deep into mordor ... ... and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came .
one of you ... ... must do this .
one does not simply walk into mordor .
its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs .
there is evil there that does not sleep .
the great eye is ever watchful .
it is a barren wasteland ... ... riddled with fire , and ash and dust .
the very air you breathe is a poisonous fume .
not with 10, 000 men could you do this .
it is folly .
have you heard nothing lord elrond has said ?
the ring must be destroyed .
and i suppose you think you are the one to do it !
and if we fail , what then ?
what happens when sauron takes back what is his ?
i will be dead before i see the ring in the hands of an elf !
never trust an elf !
do you not understand ?
while you bicker amongst yourselves , sauron' s power grows !
none can escape it !
you' il all be destroyed !
i will take it .
i will take it .
i will take the ring to mordor .
though ...
... i do not know the way .
i will help you bear this burden , frodo baggins ... ... as long as it is yours to bear .
if by my life or death i can protect you ... ... i will .
you have my sword .
and you have my bow .
and my ax .
you carry the fates of us all , little one .
if this is indeed the will of the council ... ... then gondor will see it done .
frodo' s not going anywhere without me .
it is hardly possible to separate you ... ... even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not .
we' re coming too !
you' il have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us .
anyway , you need people of intelligence on this sort of ... ... mission .
quest .
thing .
well , that rules you out , pip .
nine companions .
so be it .
you shall be the fellowship of the ring .
great !
where are we going ?
my old sword !
sting .
here , take it .
take it .
it' s so light .
yes .
made by the elves , you know .
the blade glows blue when orcs are close .
and it' s times like that , my lad , when you have to be extra careful .
here' s a pretty thing .
mithril .
as light as a feather , and as hard as dragon scales .
let me see you put it on .
come on .
my old ring .
i should very much like ... ... to hold it again , one last time .
i' m sorry i brought this upon you , my boy .
i' m sorry that you must carry this burden .
i' m sorry for everything .
we must hold to this course , west of the misty mountains , for 40 days .
if our luck holds , the gap of rohan will still be open to us .
from there , our road turns east to mordor .
two , one , five .
good !
very good .
move your feet .
you look good , pippin .
thanks .
faster !
if anyone was to ask for my opinion , which i note they' re not ... ... i' d say we were taking the long way ' round .
gandalf , we could pass through the mines of moria .
my cousin balin would give us a royal welcome .
no , i would not take the road through moria unless i had no other choice .
sorry !
get him !
for the shire !
hold him .
hold him down , merry !
you' ve got my arm !
you' ve got my arm !
what is that ?
nothing .
it' s just a wisp of cloud .
it' s moving fast .
against the wind .
crebain from dunland !
hide !
hurry !
take cover !
spies of saruman .
the passage south is being watched .
we must take the pass of caradhras .
frodo !
boromir .
it is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt ... ... over so small a thing .
such a little thing .
boromir !
give the ring to frodo .
as you wish .
i care not .
so , gandalf , you tried to lead them over caradhras .
and if that fails , where then will you go ?
if the mountain defeats you ... ... will you risk a more dangerous road ?
there is a fell voice on the air .
it' s saruman !
he' s trying to bring down the mountain !
gandalf , we must turn back !
no !
we must get off the mountain !
make for the gap of rohan , and take the west road to my city !
the gap of rohan takes us too close to isengard !
we cannot pass over a mountain .
let us go under it .
let us go through the mines of moria .
moria .
you fear to go into those mines .
the dwarves delved too greedily and too deep .
shadow and flame .
let the ring bearer decide .
frodo ?
we will go through the mines .
so be it .
the walls ... ... of moria .
well , let' s see .
ithildin .
it mirrors only starlight and moonlight .
it reads , " the doors of durin , lord of moria .
speak , friend , and enter .
what do you suppose that means ?
it' s simple .
if you are a friend , you speak the password and the doors will open .
mines are no place for a pony .
even one so brave as bill .
bye bye , bill .
go on , bill .
go on .
don' t worry , sam , he knows the way home .
do not disturb the water .
oh , it' s useless .
it' s a riddle .
speak ' friend ' and enter .
what' s the elvish word for " friend " ?
mellon .
soon , master elf , you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the dwarves .
roaring fires , malt beer , ripe meat off the bone !
this , my friend , is the home of my cousin balin .
and they call it a mine .
a mine !
this is no mine .
it' s a tomb .
no ...
no !
goblins .
we make for the gap of rohan .
we should never have come here .
now , get out of here .
get out !
frodo !
help !
strider !
help !
get off him !
aragorn !
frodo !
into the mines !
legolas !
into the cave !
run !
we now have but one choice .
we must face the long dark of moria .
be on your guard .
there are older and fouler things than orcs ... ... in the deep places of the world .
quietly now .
it' s a four day journey to the other side .
let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed .
pippin .
i have no memory of this place .
are we lost ?
no .
i think we are .
gandalf' s thinking .
merry ?
what ?
i' m hungry .
there' s something down there .
it' s gollum .
gollum ?
he' s been following us for three days .
he escaped the dungeons of barad dr ?
escaped ... ... or was set loose .
he hates and loves the ring , as he hates and loves himself .
he will never be rid of his need for it .
it' s a pity bilbo didn' t kill him when he had the chance .
pity ?
it is pity that stayed bilbo' s hand .
many that live deserve death .
some that die deserve life .
can you give it to them , frodo ?
do not be too eager to deal out death and judgment .
even the very wise cannot see all ends .
my heart tells me that gollum has some part to play yet , for good or ill ... ... before this is over .
the pity of bilbo may rule the fate of many .
i wish the ring had never come to me .
i wish none of this had happened .
so do all who live to see such times .
but that is not for them to decide .
all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us .
there are other forces at work in this world , frodo , besides the will of evil .
bilbo was meant to find the ring .
in which case , you also were meant to have it .
and that is an encouraging thought .
it' s that way .
he' s remembered .
no .
but the air doesn' t smell so foul down here .
if in doubt , meriadoc , always follow your nose .
let me risk a little more light .
behold ... ... the great realm and dwarf city of dwarrowdelf .
there' s an eye opener , and no mistake .
gimli !
no !
oh , no .
no .
here lies balin ... ... son of fundin ... ... lord of moria .
he is dead , then .
it' s as i feared .
we must move on .
we cannot linger .
they have taken the bridge and the second hall .
we have barred the gates ... ... but cannot hold them for long .
the ground shakes .
drums ... ... drums in the deep .
we cannot get out .
a shadow moves in the dark .
we cannot get out .
they are coming .
fool of a took !
throw yourself in next time , and rid us of your stupidity .
frodo !
orcs .
get back !
stay close to gandalf !
they have a cave troll .
let them come !
there is one dwarf yet in moria who still draws breath .
i think i' m getting the hang of this .
frodo !
aragorn !
aragorn !
frodo !
frodo !
oh , no .
he' s alive .
i' m all right .
i' m not hurt .
you should be dead .
that spear would have skewered a wild boar .
i think there' s more to this hobbit than meets the eye .
mithril .
you are full of surprises , master baggins .
to the bridge of khazad dm !
this way !
what is this new devilry ?
a balrog .
a demon of the ancient world .
this foe is beyond any of you .
run !
quickly !
gandalf .
lead them on , aragorn .
the bridge is near .
do as i say !
swords are no more use here .
gandalf !
merry !
pippin !
sam !
nobody tosses a dwarf .
not the beard !
steady .
hold on !
hang on !
lean forward !
steady .
come on !
now !
over the bridge !
fly !
you cannot pass !
gandalf !
i am a servant of the secret fire , wielder of the flame of anor .
the dark fire will not avail you , flame of udn !
go back to the shadow .
you shall not pass !
no !
no !
gandalf !
fly , you fools !
no !
aragorn !
legolas , get them up .
give them a moment , for pity' s sake !
by nightfall , these hills will be swarming with orcs .
we must reach the woods of lothlrien .
come , boromir .
legolas .
gimli , get them up .
on your feet , sam .
frodo ?
frodo !
stay close , young hobbits !
they say that a great sorceress lives in these woods .
an elf witch ... ... of terrible power .
all who look upon her ... ... fall under her spell .
frodo !
and are never seen again .
your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom .
you bring great evil here , ring bearer .
mr. frodo ?
well , here' s one dwarf she won' t ensnare so easily .
i have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox .
the dwarf breathes so loud , we could have shot him in the dark .
haldir of lorien .
we come here for help .
we need your protection .
aragorn , these woods are perilous .
we should go back .
you have entered the realm of the lady of the wood .
you cannot go back .
come .
she is waiting .
eight there are here , yet nine there were set out from rivendell .
tell me , where is gandalf ?
for i much desire to speak with him .
he has fallen into shadow .
the quest stands upon the edge of a knife .
stray but a little and it will fail ... ... to the ruin of all .
yet hope remains while the company is true .
do not let your hearts be troubled .
go now and rest ... ... for you are weary with sorrow and much toil .
tonight , you will sleep ...
welcome , frodo of the shire ... ... one who has seen the eye !
a lament for gandalf .
what do they say about him ?
i have not the heart to tell you .
for me , the grief is still too near .
take some rest .
these borders are well protected .
i will find no rest here .
i heard her voice inside my head .
she spoke of my father and the fall of gondor .
she said to me , " even now there is hope left .
but i cannot see it .
it is long since we had any hope .
my father is a noble man .
but his rule is failing ...
... and our people lose faith .
he looks to me to make things right , and i would do it .
i would see the glory of gondor restored .
have you ever seen it , aragorn ?
the white tower of ecthelion .
glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver .
its banners caught high in the morning breeze .
have you ever been called home ... ... by the clear ringing of silver trumpets ?
i have seen the white city ... ... long ago .
one day , our paths will lead us there .
the lords of gondor have returned .
will you look into the mirror ?
what will i see ?
even the wisest cannot tell .
for the mirror ... ... shows many things .
things that were ... ... things that are ... ... and some things ...
... that have not yet come to pass .
i know what it is you saw .
for it is also in my mind .
it is what will come to pass if you should fail .
the fellowship is breaking .
it is already begun .
he will try to take the ring .
you know of whom i speak .
one by one , it will destroy them all .
if you ask it of me ... ... i will give you the one ring .
you offer it to me freely .
i do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this .
in place of a dark lord , you would have a queen ... ... not dark but beautiful , and terrible as the dawn !
treacherous as the sea !
stronger than the foundations of the earth !
all shall love me ... ... and despair .
i pass the test .
i will diminish ... ... and go into the west ...
... and remain galadriel .
i cannot do this alone .
you are a ring bearer , frodo .
to bear a ring of power ... ... is to be alone .
this task was appointed to you .
and if you do not find a way ... ... no one will .
then i know what i must do .
it' s just ...
... i' m afraid to do it .
even the smallest person can change the course of the future .
do you know how the orcs first came into being ?
they were elves once .
taken by the dark powers ... ... tortured and mutilated .
a ruined and terrible form of life .
and now ... ... perfected .
my fighting uruk hai ... ... whom do you serve ?
saruman !
hunt them down .
do not stop until they are found .
you do not know pain .
you do not know fear .
you will taste man flesh !
one of the halflings carries something of great value .
bring them to me alive and unspoiled .
kill the others .
farewell , frodo baggins .
i give you the light of erendil ... ... our most beloved star .
may it be a light for you in dark places ... ... when all other lights go out .
frodo .
the argonath .
long have i desired to look upon the kings of old .
my kin .
we cross the lake at nightfall .
hide the boats and continue on foot .
we approach mordor from the north .
oh , yes ?
just a simple matter of finding our way through emyn muil ... ... an impassable labyrinth of razor sharp rocks .
and after that , it gets even better .
festering , stinking marshland as far as the eye can see .
that is our road .
i suggest you take some rest and recover your strength , master dwarf .
recover my ...
we should leave now .
no .
orcs patrol the eastern shore .
we must wait for cover of darkness .
it is not the eastern shore that worries me .
a shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind .
something draws near .
i can feel it .
recover strength ?
pay no heed to that , young hobbit .
where' s frodo ?
none of us should wander alone .
you , least of all .
so much depends on you .
frodo ?
i know why you seek solitude .
you suffer .
i see it day by day .
you sure you do not suffer needlessly ?
there are other ways , frodo .
other paths that we might take .
i know what you would say .
it would seem like wisdom but for the warning in my heart .
warning ?
against what ?
we' re all afraid , frodo .
but to let that fear drive us , to destroy what hope we have ...
... don' t you see that is madness ?
there is no other way .
i ask only for the strength to defend my people !
lf you would but lend me the ring .
no .
why do you recoil ?
i am no thief .
you are not yourself .
what chance do you think you have ?
they will find you .
they will take the ring .
and you will beg for death before the end !
you fool !
it is not yours , save by unhappy chance !
it could have been mine .
it should be mine !
give it to me !
give it to me !
no !
give it to me !
no .
i see your mind .
you will take the ring to sauron !
you will betray us !
you' il go to your death , and the death of us all !
curse you !
curse you and all the halflings !
frodo ?
frodo .
what have i done ?
please , frodo .
frodo , i' m sorry !
frodo ?
it has taken boromir .
where is the ring ?
stay away !
frodo !
i swore to protect you .
can you protect me from yourself ?
would you destroy it ?
aragorn .
aragorn .
elessar .
i would have gone with you to the end .
into the very fires of mordor .
i know .
look after the others .
especially sam .
he will not understand .
go , frodo !
run .
run !
mr. frodo !
find the halfling !
find the halfling !
elendil !
aragorn , go !
frodo !
hide here .
quick !
come on !
what' s he doing ?
he' s leaving .
no !
pippin !
run , frodo .
go on !
hey !
hey , you !
over here !
over here !
this way !
it' s working !
i know it' s working !
run !
the horn of gondor .
boromir .
run !
no .
they took the little ones .
hold still .
frodo .
where is frodo ?
i let frodo go .
then you did what i could not .
i tried to take the ring from him .
the ring is beyond our reach now .
forgive me .
i did not see it .
i have failed you all .
no , boromir .
you fought bravely .
you have kept your honor .
leave it .
it is over .
the world of men will fall .
and all will come to darkness ... ... and my city to ruin .
i do not know what strength is in my blood ... ... but i swear to you , i will not let the white city fall ... ... nor our people fail .
our people .
our people .
i would have followed you , my brother .
my captain .
my king .
be at peace ... ... son of gondor .
frodo !
i wish the ring had never come to me .
i wish none of this had happened .
so do all who live to see such times ... ... but that is not for them to decide .
all you have to decide ... ... is what to do with the time that is given to you .
frodo , no !
frodo !
mr. frodo !
no , sam .
go back , sam !
i' m going to mordor alone .
of course you are .
and i' m coming with you !
you can' t swim !
sam !
sam !
i made a promise , mr. frodo .
don' t you leave him , samwise gamgee .
and i don' t mean to .
i don' t mean to .
sam .
come on .
hurry !
frodo and sam have reached the eastern shore .
you mean not to follow them .
frodo' s fate is no longer in our hands .
then it has all been in vain .
the fellowship has failed .
not if we hold true to each other .
we will not abandon merry and pippin to torment and death .
not while we have strength left .
leave all that can be spared behind .
we travel light .
let us hunt some orc .
yes !
mordor .
i hope the others find a safer road .
strider will look after them .
i don' t suppose we' il ever see them again .
we may yet , mr. frodo .
we may .
sam ...
... i' m glad you are with me .
