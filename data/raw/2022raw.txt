all right , ladies and gentlemen ...
welcome aboard the world famous " reef explorer " .
my name' s davis .
i' m going to be one of the guides on board our vessel today .
also driving your boat with , huh , linda and junior .
junior is gonna be the next guide on board our vessel .
we are going to be knocked to a dive site called " magic kingdom " .
now things you want to look for down there on this dive : spotted eels , spotted morays , enough of stingrays in the sand , there' s angelfish , parrot fish , tropical fish , barbed beauties ...
is there any big fish like sharks or anything ?
yeah .
we' re going out to the open ocean , so chances are you probably might see a shark or three .
but , you know , like i tell everybody who see a shark , if you don' t want to see it , close your eyes .
no problem .
sharks over here are not very aggressive towards human beings , so therefore you don' t really have to worry about sharks .
ok .
ok , that' s enough guys .
enjoy the ride out .
ok , guys .
i need to have your attention for just a few minutes .
we are going to be entering the water in a minute .
once that everybody has entered their gear , what we want you to do is a buddy system to enter the water first .
once that buddy systems are in the water , we are going to have guided divers , and myself , linda , and junior , is gonna help you guys get into water .
linda is on surface support , so if you surface in a distance away from the boat ,
you want to let her know that you are ok .
you start to let her know you are ok by giving her a big " o " over your head .
if you are not ok , you do the international distress signal .
the international distress signal is simple , very easy to do .
help !
ok ?
all right ?
very easy , very simple .
once everybody' s in the water ,
i want you to make your way to the white float ball .
the white float ball is at the stern of the boat .
we want you to huh ...
may i sit there ?
excuse me .
i' m sorry .
go ahead .
i' m sorry .
is that your mask ?
i' m sorry , i' m sorry .
you didn' t bring your mask ?
i brought it .
i don' t know what happened .
it was supposed to be here .
sorry , sorry everybody .
i' m just , you know ...
anxious to dive .
i don' t wanna ...
do you have extra masks on the ...
linda , did you bring an extra mask ?
you have an extra mask , linda ?
no , i don' t have an extra mask .
junior ?
anyone ?
does anyone have an extra mask ?
no .
you can' t dive without a mask .
yeah , i understand that .
thank you , travis .
davis , davis .
i' m sorry guys .
go on .
alright guys .
the dive is going to be at a maximum drop of 60 feet , so ...
therefore , we are going to be down there for about 35 minutes .
you are ready ?
yeah .
are you ok ?
yeah , i' m ok .
i can' t equalize my ears .
ok .
are you going to report to the guardian , trying to get equalized ?
i don' t think i can go down .
alright , do me a favor .
inflate your bc , put the regulator in your mouth and swim back towards the platform .
ok .
up , stand up , stretch your knees up .
how was it down there ?
i didn' t get down .
you didn' t .
why not ?
what happened ?
i can' t get my ears equalized .
you feel all right ?
yeah , i' m good .
thanks .
you mind if i borrow this ?
is it ok ?
i' il bring it right back .
save some time .
yeah ?
sure .
thank you .
god bless you .
i love you .
are you going down now ?
yeah , linda , i' m going down .
hallelujah .
the only problem i have is you don' t have a buddy right now .
i don' t need a buddy .
i' ve dived all my life .
unfortunately you do if you' re on our boat , sir .
your boat .
give me a break .
find a buddy for me .
someone down there' s coming back up .
can you dive with me ?
unfortunately , if i don' t find you a buddy , i can' t let you go , sir .
i love high water .
i' m diving in the finest .
help me .
come on , dive .
what' s your name ?
brian .
are you ready to go , brian ?
we' re set .
see ?
i got a buddy .
all set .
sir , your regulator .
regulator .
yes , sir .
yeah , got one of those .
have a good time .
thank you .
there' s a place in heaven for you .
i love you .
thank you .
it was great , man .
yeah , i' m good .
you good ?
yeah .
thanks buddy .
i appreciated .
thanks a lot .
you are an angel .
i needed that .
did you see that shark down there ?
yeah .
did everybody enjoy their dive ?
yeah .
that' s good .
have we got everybody ?
daniel , where is the boat ?
it' s a good question .
i guess it' s one of those .
you gotta be kidding me .
it better be one of those .
but which one do you think ?
i don' t know .
did you get us lost ?
no .
so we are in the right spot ?
yes .
i' m 90 % sure .
90 % ?
why only 90 % ? ' cause the boat is not here .
there is a coral head exactly 42 feet below us .
i marked it on the way down .
yeah .
i can still see the stocks .
the stocks ?
yeah , there' s three prawn , like a forked thing right below us .
you are unbelievable .
you can still find some of those little coral formation in the middle of the ocean , but you get lost going to my mother' s .
i need an incentive .
you love my mother .
they obviously cannot see us .
you think it' s time to swim ?
swim where ?
i don' t know .
i think ...
that one is the closest .
honey , it' s a bad idea .
why ?
because we are not sure that' s our boat .
and if it' s not our boat ,
that means we could swim farther from our boat .
besides , you know how far away that is ?
it' s really far .
it' s farther than that .
and if it' s not our boat , they can pull away at anytime .
and our fucking boat , wherever the hell it is , will have a hell of time trying to find us .
you' re going somewhere ?
just my face .
i hate to tell you this , but ,
i didn' t see anything that looks like any kind of coral formation .
could you just show me ?
i' d just feel better .
sure ?
see it ?
cause i don' t see anything .
shit !
what ?
you don' t see it , because it' s not there .
so does that mean ... ... that since we' ve surfaced , we' re drifting .
oh , shit .
but what does that mean ?
should we swim ?
goddam it .
we wasted all this time .
honey i hate to tell you this , but swim or not , we' re going where this current decides .
are they moving ?
hey !
yes .
oh god .
please let this be them .
it' s gotta be , right ?
yes .
they' re coming right this way .
yep .
you realize that' s a distress signal .
we are in distress .
daniel , did you just pee ?
yep .
you' re so disgusting .
you said you are a little cold .
daniel , was that a shark ?
maybe , or a dolphin .
if it was a dolphin , you' d be on your way over there to play with it , so you obviously think it was a shark .
that' s all we need right now .
that' s ok .
you were patting a shark less than an hour ago .
please , that was nothing but a big old catfish .
it was more than two hours ago .
you know , now i' m starting to really get cold .
it' s ok .
oh , jesus christ !
i thought he said they never come that close .
they also said the boat would be here .
it' s gone .
it was probably just curious .
a couple of bodies floating up in the middle of nowhere ,
i' m sure it' s not something it sees everyday .
oh , daniel .
where the hell are they ?
oh , you gotta be kidding me .
it makes me feel better .
but what do we do if it comes back ?
i don' t know .
do we splash ?
do we stay still ?
you are the one who watches " shark week " .
first of all , we should be in a cage .
no , we should be on land .
sharks are attracted to wounded fish .
ok .
so i guess you just not splash around too much .
just sort of ...
stay still ?
try to stay still .
oh , god .
ok .
i can' t stand not knowing if it' s under me .
i' m just gonna look , ok ?
ok .
okay .
katharine hepburn and nick nolte in " grace quigley " and nick nolte and john malkovich in " mulholland falls " .
how' s that for a quick .
always quick .
all right .
it' s your turn .
i , hum ...
you know , i really don' t feel like playing .
okay .
feel hungry ?
of course .
i' m starving .
ouch !
shit !
what ?
something just bit me here ...
what ?
where ?
i don' t know .
it' s right down by my ankle .
oh , god .
it kills .
goddam it !
it burns !
i don' t see anything .
did it get you ?
yes !
what is it ?
i don' t know , but the fucker really stung me .
it hurts .
let' s get the hell out of here .
okay .
i think we are away from them .
is that far enough ?
anything ?
you got anything ?
no .
damn , those fuckers stung .
i know .
where did it get you ?
on my ankle , on my leg .
through your wet suit ?
i don' t know .
i guess so .
so are you ok ?
no .
i' m not ok .
are you ok ?
we find our boat , we' il be ok .
oh , come on , honey .
i know , i know , i know .
i' m sorry .
it really sucks , but we' re going to get through this , ok ?
ok .
i know i know .
god , okay .
i' ve just never heard of anything so fucked up in my entire life .
who' s ever heard of two people getting
left in the middle of the ocean before ?
i have actually .
you have ?
yeah .
where ?
dive magazines .
it' s a lot more common than you think .
well , thanks for telling me when we got certified .
over there .
oh , my god .
oh , daniel .
oh , god .
please , please , please , let just be them .
oh , god .
i don' t even care if it' s not them .
just please see us and pick us up .
i don' t think they can see us .
wish we had more sun .
they can' t see us .
i know .
they are leaving .
yeah .
stay close .
what if they don' t know we' re missing ?
there' s no way .
they took a head count on the boat .
i saw it .
our stuff is on board .
we have their tanks .
and we know we' ve drifted .
it may take them a while , but they will find us .
i hate to tell you , but i think my dramamine is running off .
you' re getting nauseous ?
yeah .
honey , i could kill those fuckers .
i know .
it' s just all this going up and down of the weights , i think .
you' re probably getting dehydrated .
yeah ?
but we can' t drink the water , right ?
no .
i should' ve told you that before .
you didn' t , did you ?
a little .
honey , stop .
it will give you diarrhea , and make you even more dehydrated .
great .
shark week " ?
disasters at sea " , history channel .
i guess this means i have to stop complaining about you watching so much television .
but i didn' t know i might get something out of this .
i' m really , really not feeling well .
oh , man .
you think maybe if i took my weights out . then it wouldn' t pull on me so much ?
just keep the belt , drop the weights .
you' il see' em try to charge us for those .
oh , hey .
we should put our gloves on .
how are your stings ?
still there .
they' re the one thing i think the salt water is actually helping .
this glove isn' t helping them .
i don' t feel very good .
why don' t you lay back for a little bit ?
yeah ?
yeah .
just lay back .
i' m sorry .
it' s ok .
i got you .
just relax .
ok .
there you go .
ok .
just for a few minutes .
just relax .
close your eyes .
daniel , i have to pee .
ok .
it' s gonna be warm for a minute .
thanks .
daniel !
oh , god .
daniel !
daniel !
susanne !
daniel , i' m over here .
susanne !
oh , thank god .
it' s ok .
i got you .
oh , my god .
what happened ?
i don' t know .
are you all right ?
i' m fine .
you ok ?
what happened ?
where did you go ?
i must have fallen asleep and we drifted apart .
jesus .
i' m sorry .
you scared the hell out of me .
i' m so sorry .
it' s ok .
i' m glad you are here .
oh , my god .
it' s ok .
how long are we sleeping ?
god , i' m so out of it .
jesus , we' ve been in the water for 7 hours .
daniel , i feel something on my leg .
what ?
i don' t know .
it hurts .
it' s your sting ?
the wrong leg .
oh , my god . it really hurts .
we just try to keep ...
i don' t see anything .
i can' t either .
it' s on the back .
i just can' t tell .
hurt all over the whole thing .
just leave it alone .
ok ?
don' t tap it .
i' m not touching it .
well , something is touching it .
it' s not me , honey .
i' m not here .
my hands are all here .
something is tapping on it .
i will take a look .
jesus .
oh , god .
i feel sick .
i' m sorry , honey .
i threw up .
fish gotta eat too .
speaking of which , the thing patting at your leg , is just a little cleaner fish .
what about my leg ?
a little cut .
how could it get cut ?
i don' t know .
maybe you rub it against my knife over sleeping , or something .
oh , come on .
it wasn' t a shark , was it ?
no , honey .
are you sure ?
no .
if it was a shark , your leg would be gone .
great .
and most , it was a teeny little barracuda just checking to see if you tasted good .
oh , god .
is it deep ?
no , it' s not deep .
let' s swim out this puke .
ok .
come on .
that' s far enough , you think ?
yeah .
oh , baby .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
rinse your mouth a little bit .
yeah .
just don' t swallow any , ok ?
spit it back out .
can still feel that tapping .
what , the fish ?
yeah .
try not to focus on this .
relax .
here you go .
what is it ?
are you ok ?
it' s leg cramp .
can i help you ?
is there anything i can do ?
i got it .
ouch !
we are really falling apart , aren' t we ?
oh , god .
oh , honey .
oh , god .
they' re gone .
they' re gone .
jesus , daniel .
what kind are they ?
the big ones .
i' m serious .
are they the bad kind ?
i have no idea .
oh , my god .
no , no , no .
be still .
don' t splash around .
oh , my god .
this can' t be normal .
honey , oh , honey .
i don' t know what is worse , seeing them or not seeing them .
seeing them .
unbelievable .
this is truly un fucking believable .
the best part is that we paid to do this .
we paid to be out here .
we paid those incompetent fuckers to drop us out in the middle of the fucking ocean .
we wanted an ocean view .
boy , did we get it ?
you feel better ?
i wouldn' t exactly call it better .
you finished yelling ?
that could be .
oh , good .
you' re not the only one stuck out here , you know .
what ?
are you mad at me ?
no .
why ?
because i was yelling ?
no .
fine .
you be mad .
it' s a great vacation , honey , isn' t it ?
so now we entered no talking phase , uh ?
could you maybe answer one last question ?
has this somehow over the hours become my fault ?
let' s just drop it .
of course .
you believe what you want to believe .
but i know for certain that we were in the right spot .
it' s not just a matter of being in the right spot .
it' s being there on time .
we were on time .
we were early .
he said 10 : 30 .
do we always have to get it so close ?
for god' s sake ,
why don' t we stay with the group ?
we always have to do things different than everybody else .
we shouldn' t have spent so much time with that god damn eel .
well , that' s a nice touch , adding " we " .
especially since you wanted have nothing to do with that fucking eel .
do you honestly , seriously , honey ,
do you honestly think that we got left behind because we were late ?
i' m serious .
do you have any idea how idiotic that sounds ?
oh , so now i' m an idiot .
we are where we are , aren' t we ?
yes , fine , because of me .
you refused to swim .
my god .
there were boats all around us .
you refused , and now , look , look around us .
we are stuck in the middle of the ocean .
with nobody .
even if we had been swimming for the last five hours ,
we would not be any closer to a boat than we are now .
the only reason we are even out here in the first place , is because of your fucking job .
what ?
if it were not for your job ,
we would not have thrown out our plan out of the window ,
rush around the last minute , and
settled on this fucking trip .
we would be at home , in the middle of our hectic lives , which right now sounds like heaven to me .
and in a month' s time , as we planned seven , seven months ago , we would be where we were supposed to be in the first place , and paying less than we are now to be shark bait .
oh , damn it .
i can' t even believe you bring all that up right now .
you were the one that picked the dates .
yeah , out of my whopping two choices , this was the better date .
i wanted to go skiing .
oh , god .
i can' t believe how far we' ve drifted .
you think the current will take us over there ?
hopefully .
how' s your leg ?
it' s ok .
you know , hurts a little bit , but it ... it' s ok .
all right , let' s go for it .
i love you .
i love you .
we are gonna be fine .
other people going to vacations , they spend their days just laying around , eating and drinking .
that sounds pretty good right now .
actually that could .
this' il be the story we' il be telling for the rest of our lives .
daniel .
what ?
look .
wait .
oh , my god .
wait .
they are five of them .
look .
hold on .
where those comes from ?
you know how dry my mouth gets when i' m diving ,
i wanted put them in the dive' s bag but you had it , so i stuffed them in here at the last minute .
oh .
never thought anything could taste so good .
just hold me for a second , ok ?
i gotta make sure we don' t lose these ones .
i got you .
ok .
you' re done ?
yeah .
what is it ?
you are all right ?
oh , my god .
i don' t see it .
are you ok ?
i don' t know .
i' m bit .
oh , my god , honey .
i' m bit .
the fucker bit me .
ok , hold on .
i' m gonna look .
oh , god .
it fucking hurts .
daniel , breathe , ok ?
stay right here .
i' m gonna look .
ok ?
i' m gonna go look .
you keep breathing .
daniel , listen to me .
i' m going to go look .
you breathe .
i' m breathing .
ok .
stay where you are .
i can' t see .
my leg is still there , right ?
i can feel it .
ok .
it' s all right , honey .
you gotta put something on it .
ok .
it' s bleeding .
it' s bad , isn' t it ?
it' s bad .
no .
it' s not that bad .
ok , i' m going to tie something around it .
just keep breathing for me , ok ?
i' m breathing .
god , it fucking hurts .
i' il put my weight belt tethering around it .
you wait .
this can' t be happening .
how could this be happening .
i got bitten by a shark .
we could actually be eaten alive by shark out here .
we don' t know anybody who' s ever been bitten by a shark .
there are always three or four guys there on the shark show .
hey , it' s all right .
it' s not that bad .
it' s going to be fine , ok ?
you are going to have a nice scar to show your friends and that' s it .
ok ?
look at me .
look at me , baby .
that' s right .
you are fine .
you are not that bad .
just hurts right now .
the salt water will make it get better
it' s ok .
just hold on .
just breathe .
it' s ok that it hurts .
oh , god .
something is trying to get to my foot .
it' s a big one .
i love you .
stay still .
stay where you are .
it' s gonna be ok .
you hold on .
you hold on , daniel .
you don' t leave me out here , by myself .
you promise me you' il hold on .
my leg !
daniel !
hello ?
hello ?
it' s the manager .
hello ?
so what' s the final weight on it ?
2 . 13
give me a knife .
how' s that ?

man , they really do eat anything .
i wonder if it works .
