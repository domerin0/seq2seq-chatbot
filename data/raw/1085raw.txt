you really don' t care if i' m interested in you ?
in french , if the adjective comes after the noun instead of before , is the meaning the same ?

i don' t love you .
okay , angela , that' s peachy .
peachy and cream .
farewell , camille .
return to your convent .
all men are lying , fickle , false , garrulous , hypocritical and arrogant .
in love , we are often betrayed , often hurt , and often unhappy .
but we love .
and on the brink of the grave we turn to look back and we say ,
' i have often suffered ,
i have sometimes been mistaken , but i have loved .
i have lived my life and not some substitute forged out of my pride and world weariness . " '
she exits .

be right back .
why do men always leave saying " be right back " ?
they' re cowards .
it makes up for all women being ugly .
<i>in that case , i' il sulk . </ i>
<i>there , she' s sulking . </ i>
<i>i hope you realize i' m sulking . </ i>
i' m ignoring it on purpose .
then there' s no reason to sulk .
i' m not sulking , so that you' il stop sulking .
men always have the last word .
women always act like victims .
in that case , i refuse to sulk .
then i' il sulk .

what shall we talk about ?
dunno .
i' m scared .
so am i.
i' m scared .
did my call today surprise you ?
i wonder .
were you glad ?
i wonder .
what' il we talk about ?
i don' t know .
i' m thinking .
in the morning paper ... there was a funny article .
what ?
a girl' s in love with two guys at the same time .
she sends them express letters , arranging to meet them , the first at gare du nord , and the other , two hours later , in southern paris .
she sends them off .
and just as they go off ... she realizes she mixed up the envelopes .
the letter which starts " paul darling " is in the envelope to pierre , and vice versa .
so she' s in a panic .
she rushes to the first guy' s place .
the letter hasn' t arrived yet .
so she says , " darling , you' il get an express letter .
don' t believe what' s in it .
so she has to explain everything .
in the end , he throws her out when he learns she' s got another guy .
so she thinks ,
i' ve lost one , but i still have the other one .
she rushes across town to see the second guy .
but he' s received her letter .
the guy doesn' t seem at all upset .
on the contrary .
she says , " you' re so sweet .
you forgive me .
he' s surprised but keeps quiet .
she tells him the story , thinking he wants to humiliate her first .
then , suddenly , he throws her out , too , as he shows her his letter .
and she realizes she hadn' t mixed up the envelopes .
and then ?
nothing .
she was a bit like you .
me ?
not on your life .
i don' t mean the story .
but ...
i dunno ... the personality .
always getting things wrong .
no kidding .
why' re you looking at me that way ?
because i love you .
come off it .
i do .
i didn' t sleep last night .
i realized that .
all by yourself ?
of course .
it' s not true .
does that bother you ?
that it' s not true ?
i don' t know .
yes , it' s true .
i don' t know what' s true or not .
i always get things wrong .
but there' s no way of knowing .
for example , tell me a lie .
it' s raining .
and now the truth .
the sun' s out .
what' s wrong ?
your expression didn' t change .
so what ?
but the truth should look different from a lie .
what of it ?
you just need to know .
you know .
but others don' t have to believe you .
and that' s too bad .
it means every man for himself .
people always manage somehow .
that' s just it .
it' s sad .
why don' t you believe i love you ?
because i want to be sure .
so do i.
you' re not even sure ?
about me , yes .
but not you .
then everything' s okay .
no , it' s not .
but for me it doesn' t matter whether i love you or not .
<i>have pity on two blind men . </ i>
not with me , you don' t .
oops , sorry .
it' s these dark glasses .
you can' t see a thing .
i never saw them before .
we were informers together .
the one in blue is albert .
i like him .
he came up with a neat stunt .
he wrote to pregnant women saying ,
send me 10 francs , and i' il predict your child' s sex .
if i' m wrong , i' il refund your money .
he was right half the time , obviously .
it' s a great scheme .
i think it' s disgusting .
it' s not dishonest .
half the time he was wrong .
so he refunded their money .
but even so .
what i find disgusting ... ... is being with one guy and thinking of another .
if you don' t know what you' re saying , keep quiet ,
mr. alfred .
you' re thinking of emile .
that' s just it , no .
how can i convince you that i love you ?
got any change ?
wanna hear a record ?
which one ?
itsy bitsy bikini " ?
no .
