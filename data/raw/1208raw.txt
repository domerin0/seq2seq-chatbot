the zipper jacket' s in now !
but i' ve lost the red tie !

the red tie' s still out !
we' ve wasted enough time !

i' ve never had a framing problem before !
i feel bad for the guy in the red tie .

he doesn' t know it yet , but he' s out .
poor guy .
no , he' s an idiot .
am i let go ?
only him in accounting .
does he know it ?
not yet .
why' s he being fired ?
staff reduction .
that' s lousy .
he' s a good man .
i tried to keep him .
he' s nice but boring .
no , honest , dedicated .
right , a real drag !
morning , miss bertrand , ariane ...
coffee , anyone ?
no , thanks .
did you know ?
what ?
that i' ve been fired .
not really .
i' d heard about redundancy .
nothing specific .
poor guy .
yes , it' s no fun .
we' re not in .
leave us a message .
christine ?
frank ?
are you there ?
pick it up !
he wants you .
you' re not in ?
frank ?
see , he wants you !
that' s me ?
you' re out .
i' il call later .
i can' t now .
i' m late .
i' m late too .
no , call me at the office , christine .
i' ve been fired .
next month , no job .
i found out ... and i wanted to talk to you .
but i' il find a job .
don' t worry about your alimony .
see you later .
big hug .
it' s me .
i got your message .
i' m not worried .
you' il be okay .
call tomorrow .
i' m out tonight .
i' m not worried .
you' il bounce back .
what are you doing there ?
don' t move .
enjoy your meal .
i have to go jump out the window .
my wife said i' d bounce back .
we' il soon see .
don' t do it .
you' il wreck my car .
i' m parked under your window .
you' il land on it .
it' s an old battered car , but the roof s fine .
don' t be an idiot .
give me back my cat !
thanks .
it' s a silly animal .
like my old car .
i' m fond of it .
i' m new .
i moved in today .
jean pierre belone .
let' s toast it .
come for a drink .
it isn' t my car , but how else could i stop you ?
nor my cat , but it made you open your door .
want it ?
then i' il keep it .
good night .
take good care .
i won' t leave till i' ve heard your voice !
silent people scare me .
say one word and i' il leave .
thanks .
come have a drink .
i' m lonely , and no happier than you .
you wanted to die ?
don' t know .
i may not have the guts .
all because you got fired ?
no , my whole life' s a mess .
tell me .
i won' t bother you with it .
it' s so dull .
go on .
there' s nothing on tv tonight .
my wife left me two years ago , and i still love her .
my 17 year old son has dropped me .
now i' ve lost my job .
it was all i had .
fascinating , right ?
yes , it is dull .
at least you' re frank .
i made you smile .
i found out from santini in personnel .
he' s thrilled i got fired !
why ?
he never liked me .
he' s a jerk !
he broke my collarbone .
made me try out for our rugby team .
you see me playing rugby ?
no .
he flattened me .
i got three weeks sick leave .
very funny !
i liked that company .
i was there 20 years .
i won' t bore you any longer .
maybe we can save your job .
let me think .
save my job ?
you' re dreaming !
i' il think it over .
but don' t jump .
that' s no solution .
of the 123 passengers , none survived .
bad weather has hampered the rescue operation .
in denmark , the ferry that sank off the coast ... is the worst disaster of the decade .
there' s talk of 400 casualties .
in indonesia , no news of the 23 tourists kidnapped by guerillas .
an ominous silence !
the weather forecast is no better .
hello .
sorry about the mess .
i' m still moving in .
it' s my books .
how will they all fit ?
and the closet ?
i' m coming .
we have to talk .
meet me down in the caf .
i may have a solution .
i used to be an industrial psychologist .
i know about corporate practices .
if you want to keep your job , you must ...
if i want to keep my job ?
come out of the closet .
what ?
come out of the closet .
admit you' re gay .
but i' m not at all gay !
who cares , if others believe it , especially your boss ?
these are recent , before she left me , two years ago .
she' s pretty .
what does she do ?
translates .
majored in english .
now earns a bit .
but she needs my alimony .
when we met , she was nursing a heartbreak .
i became her confidant .
a dumb role .
she married me as coldly as she left me .
she' s so pretty ... and i' m hideous !
you' re hardly cute .
you know how to cheer up a guy !
flattery' s a no no for depressives .
you' re an eyesore with no future and an idiot .
feel better now ?
i don' t feel any worse .
my problem is my insignificance .
here' s my recurrent dream .
i' m being born , but i' m already here .
the doctor hasn' t noticed and tells my mom to keep pushing .
i wait in a corner for them to realize i' m here .
the symbolism' s pretty obvious .
i' il get them back to you soon .
what are they for ?
here .
what' s that ?
it' s you .
with a friend .
we' il shuffle it up .
digital magic !
coming !
did i wake you ?
never mind .
did you mail that letter ?
yes , last night .
shit !
what' s wrong ?
i thought it over .
your strategy won' t work .
come in .
i can' t fake being gay .
i' m no actor .
i' il get exposed !
cup of coffee ?
i could use one .
you' re right .
if you camp it up , you' il be a flop .
you bet !
it' s hard , especially playing a flamer .
most actors who try are way off and vulgar .
so it won' t work .
no .
you' il pull it off if you do nothing at all .
just stay the shy , discreet person they' ve known for years .
what' il change is how they perceive you .
suzanne !
that' s pignon !
holy shit !
francoise ?
pignon , in accounting , you' il never guess .
wait .
i' il send you a copy .
robert ?
you sitting down ?
don' t hang up .
morning , martine , suzanne .
morning , sir .
how' s the mail today ?
i' il bring it right in , sir .
well ?
i want to know who sent them , and why !
if only there was an anonymous letter ...
don' t fire pignon !
we' il tell the media ... you hate gays .
but only these photos .
we' re not firing him ' cause he' s gay !
but people will say that' s why !
i' ve got nothing against gays !
damn that faggot !
what do we do ?
madame ...
gentlemen .
good morning !
before we get down to business , i want you to see these .
they' re your sons .
good looking boys !
no , the bare assed guy is an accountant here .
pass them around .
it' s pignon !
who took them ?
i don' t know , but it' s hateful .
how surprising !
not to me .
i tried him out at rugby .
you can spot them at once !
broke his collarbone !
had to give up pantyhose !
this is no joke .
we have to solve the pignon problem .
we did .
he' s being fired !
what do we make here , santini ?
sorry ?
what kind of products ?
products made of rubber .
what is our star item ?
con ...
cond ... ... oms .
if we fire him , we' il have every gay movement on our backs .
better to have them on your back than up .
what do you do saturday nights ?
i asked how you spend saturday nights .
gay bashing ?
not at all !
where do you go ?
the park , to hunt drag queens ?
that humor is out now .
i won' t say it twice !
i' ve consulted our pr head .
we keep pignon for now and stay out of his private life !
we must !
he' s so dumb .
outdid himself !
let' s make him ...
less dumb ?
no hope !
we can try !
he let you have it !
i lightened the mood , and he slammed me !
you' d better watch out .
why ?
you' re on your way out .
he' s got his eye on you .
you can' t fire a guy for a mild joke !
would they fire me for that ?
if i were you , i' d be very nice to pignon .
what do you mean , " very nice " ?
you' re known as a macho gay basher .
to change that , take pignon to lunch .
i won' t lunch with that fruit !
i hope no one heard you .
i can' t .
i' m lunching with pignon !
very good .
what a world !
they fire straights and keep on every stinking ...
who copied it ?
don' t know .
we' re all giggling .
put it away .
he' s due .
aren' t they cute ?
get to work !
i had a hunch .
i can spot ' em .
i did him .
it' s his walk , his little ways .
i said to myself , " that' s one !
i didn' t .
it' s the way he looks at you ... sideways , round eyed .
like a pigeon .
are pigeons gay ?
coffee , anyone ?
no , thanks .
no , thanks .
he walks tight assed .
france is no good at rugby ?
we played south africa and new zealand .
they' re better .
don' t kid yourself .
the " all blacks " and " springboks " are way ahead !
they have the super twelve .
okay , they' re pros , but in europe ... some of our teams can match them .
felix is right .
we win now and then ... but in the long run ...
you' ve got a fan !
it' s the dating game !
you' ve got taste .
pignon is mignon !
that humor is out now !
i won' t say it twice !
how are you ?
fine , thanks .
i' m glad .
you eat beets ?
yes .
they' re healthy .
i had shredded carrots .
really ?
they' re healthy too .
i' il have some .
what ?
beets .
i' il have some too .
enjoy your meal .
thanks .
listen .
yes ?
we should grab a bite someday .
well ?
seems to be working .
come in !
santini , " mr. rugby , " asked me to lunch .
that' s a good sign .
to your future .
how can i thank you ?
i should thank you .
why ?
i' m retired .
life isn' t much fun .
then you ... suicidal , unemployed ... appear .
thanks to you , now i' m neither .
and i' ve found the way to full employment .
3 million less unemployed , 3 million more gays with jobs !
there' s another thing .
i got fired a long time ago .
now , in a way , i' m getting even .
coming !
that cat never stops eating !
i open tins all day long .
feels like he ate a whole ox today !
why did they fire you ?
20 years ago , for the same reason they' re keeping you on .
so things are evolving !
move your asses !
push , you fakers !
watch out for those butts !
what' il i say to him ?
eating alone with that faggot !
stop saying " faggot " !
you' re right !
sorry .
you' il goof up and say , " who needs gays in gay paree ?
why would i say that ?
that' s how you are .
i' m from marseilles , not paris !
okay , forget it .
just be nice to him .
what can i talk about with that sissy ?
first , pick a good restaurant .
i did .
the truffle .
costs a fortune !
show him you' re not a brute .
say what you love about rugby is the warm locker room camaraderie .
what warm camaraderie ?
men together under the showers , naked in the steam ... glistening , muscular bodies .
a buddy soaps your back , you soap his .
it' s why you love rugby .
it is ?
no , that' s just what you tell him !
get rid of your fag bashing image , damn it !
shit .
traffic was awful today .
yes .
and paris traffic can be really awful !
i' m glad you were let go ...
i mean , that it worked out .
thanks .
you' re good manpower .
sorry about your mishap at rugby .
i' ve forgotten it .
people think i' m just a big brute ... but i' m as sensitive as the next guy .
i love rugby for the showers .
really ?
the showers ?
not the actual showers .
you can shower anywhere .
sure .
how can i put it ?
a shower with a naked buddy .
get me ?
no .
sure you do .
you' re with a naked buddy in the shower , soaping his ...
now what is it ?
picked a wine , sir ?
give me the wine list !
where was i ?
soaping your buddy in the shower .
i was ?
right , i was .
red or white ?
not at lunch , or i doze at work .
i' il drink .
makes me gay .
i didn' t mean it that way .
shit .
christine , you there ?
i had lunch with santini .
now my job looks safe again .
but i' ve had no news from frank in two weeks .
a cop' s stopping me for phoning and driving .
i' il call you .
you need a " hands free " model , sir .
i' ve ordered one , officer .
driver' s license .
don' t ticket me for that .
i phoned my wife about our son .
he' s at a tricky age .
you got kids , officer ?
not when i' m on duty .
my son avoids me .
i never see him .
last saturday , i waited all day .
i ticketed an old lady .
she cried over her dead dog .
next , a girl sobbed over her boyfriend .
let me do my job !
leave me out of your problems !
he was my kid .
now , he' s a stranger .
move on .
get lost !
well ?
you scared me !
how' d it go ?
very well .
he had duck .
i had a nice stew .
skip what you ate .
i was the essence of tact .
we chatted delightfully !
i acted like an old queen with that sissy !
now he thinks i grab guys in the showers !
no one can hear us !
damn your paranoia !
i' m ashamed of myself .
i' m through with that fruit !
you okay ?
fine .
and you ?
who were you talking about ?
what ?
i thought i heard " fruit .
we didn' t say " fruit . " did we ?
absolutely not .
shit !
what ?
he heard every word !
so what ?
he' s a pal .
but he gabs to victor , who gabs to the boss .
will the spade rat on me ?
now what ?
if you' re a racist too !
i am not !
is " spade " a nice word ?
i meant no harm .
go away .
i' il get fired too .
listen to me !
watch out !
he hardly waved .
at our lunch , he was cold with me .
the harder i tried , the more he clammed up .
it was awful .
you didn' t go far enough .
he sensed you were faking it .
they' re intuitive .
should i have taken him to a disco ?
show him you' re his friend , that you love him .
that i love him ?
he was destroyed !
i want to hear him declare his love !
you' re laying it on too thick .
he called you a spade .
he did ?
he said he meant no harm .
okay , give it all you' ve got !
harder !
push !
get into it !
you' re a bunch of sissies !
let' s see if you' ve got balls !
that' s standard rugby talk !
don' t bug me for that !
i didn' t say a thing .
now anything i say ...
people think you took the photos of pignon .
i heard it too .
is it true ?
no way !
really ?
what' s this crap ?
you hate gays ' cause you' re a latent one .
who says that ?
i had a strategy .
you turned it down !
what strategy ?
if they call you gay ' cause you hate gays ... hang out with one to show you' re not gay !
could you say that slower ?
thursday is his birthday .
it is ?
giving fran ?
ois pignon a gift would be smart !
he was seen in the park last night .
a guy in sales , driving through , saw him half naked .
look at that flamer !
how are things ?
fine .
and you ?
i' m due at maintenance .
later !
later !
i hear he' s hot for an office boy .
i' il hurry !
bastard' s a pedophile too !
yesterday , he was a bore .
today , a pervert .
he hid it well .
i' ve worked six years with him .
it' s tales .
he' s no sex freak .
what about him grabbing ass in those photos ?
you still got them ?
something' s odd .
what ?
no gay wears bare ass lederhosen now !
those photos are 20 years old !
maybe they' re into nostalgia .
it' s not him .
what ?
see the spot on his arm ?
look .
in short sleeves , he has no snake tattoo .
maybe it' s recent .
or a decal .
his arm isn' t that muscular .
it' s not him .
then who ?
they' re manipulated photos .
why make him look like a faggot ?
i don' t know , but it' s not him .
let' s get his shirt off .
what ?
to check out the tattoo .
easy !
you say , " i want to see your strong arms .
get undressed !
no , we shout , " take it off , pignon !
take it all off !
hello again !
still no one for coffee ?
no , thanks .
think he heard ?
i hope not .
i' ve got an idea .
now what ?
i bump into him with his coffee .
his shirt is drenched , he removes it ...
you can' t stain his shirt !
why not ?
that' s unfair !
damn his shirt .
at least we' il know !
i' m so sorry !
i feel awful .
look at your blouse .
i' m sorry .
better take it off .
wasn' t me .
she bumped into me .
no , it wasn' t your fault .
i' il get myself another coffee .
mr. pignon !
yes ?
mind staying late tonight ?
to finish the balance sheet .
no problem .
if we run late , we' il order food and eat here .
okay ?
if i add sales tax , the figures match .
congratulations .
let' s quit .
you' re tired .
we' re not quite done .
we' il do it later .
let' s break and eat .
a new invention .
try it .
thanks .
about the august sub balance .
if we carried over the premiums ...
we' re having dinner !
we' il work later .
sorry .
in six years , it' s our first dinner together .
yes , our first .
easy on the wine .
i can' t handle it .
to our first dinner !
i' m glad you kept your job .
thanks .
and the reason why ... shows people are changing .
you mind discussing it ?
what ?
the reason you were kept on .
no , why would i mind ?
wait .
are you sure you know the reason ?
they figured i wasn' t such a lousy accountant !
you don' t know about the photos ?
what photos ?
i shouldn' t discuss it , but everyone' s seen them .
the boss got photos of you going into a gay bar ... in a compromising position .
they were meant to harm you , but it backfired .
that' s how you held on to your job .
easy on the wine .
this food' s salty .
i' m thirsty .
i didn' t fall for it .
what ?
they' d been manipulated .
it was a montage .
a montage ?
i' ve known you for a while .
that can' t be you in those photos .
i' ve known you through a marriage , a divorce .
i can' t believe it .
is that you ... bare assed in lederhosen , being fondled by a guy ?
yes , it' s me .
mind you , it didn' t shock me .
we' re all entitled to privacy , but it surprised me .
and not just me .
i drank too much .
i need to lie down .
are you all right ?
it' s nothing .
i' il be fine .
we' il get back to work .
sorry .
i didn' t realize anyone was here .
i undid your collar so you could breathe .
sorry .
i have to go .
mr. pignon !
see you tomorrow .
' night !
she tried to undress you ?
i drank too much .
when i woke up , she had undone my shirt .
are you two an item ?
we' re just coworkers !
what got into her ?
are you hot for her ?
she' s pretty , smart , has men at her feet .
why would she want me ?
because you' re not a man .
what ?
reclaiming a gay man turns some women on .
not her !
she didn' t fall for it , asked me questions ...
about what ?
she thinks the photos were manipulated .
i settled that .
wasn' t easy .
i had to look her in the eye and say i liked men .
i came out of a closet i never went into .
maybe , but now you' re in deep shit .
why ?
that woman undressing you isn' t good .
she may blow your cover .
does she care if i' m gay ?
it' s dangerous .
we must counterattack .
have a seat , pignon .
thank you , sir .
you asked to see me ?
yes .
it' s tricky .
it' s about miss bertrand .
i' m listening .
tell her to stop fondling me .
sorry ?
she' s after me .
it' s unpleasant .
after you ?
how ?
she assaulted me ... sexually .
i see .
almost tore off my shirt last night .
she shouldn' t do that .
she' s my boss , but i' m not an object , sir .
i understand .
i' il look into it .
thank you , sir .
don' t be rough on her .
i just want to be left alone .
i' il look into it .
joint' s okay but pricey .
i can' t digest red peppers .
isn' t that pignon ?
yes .
what' s he doing here ?
holy shit !
what ?
the fairy' s ogling teenage boys !
dirty fruitcake !
frank !
i was nearby , so i decided to surprise you .
how are you ?
fine .
and you ?
fine , but i never see you .
i waited last week .
i couldn' t come .
i was busy .
you should call .
i waited .
sure .
gotta go .
coming for lunch saturday ?
sure .
he was ogling boys .
it turned my stomach !
i should' ve kicked his ass !
he' d love that !
the guy' s revolting , unhealthy !
my kid could be pawed by that scumbag !
if i were a man and as tough as you guys are ...
i would definitely teach him a lesson .
you wanted to see me , sir ?
sit down , miss bertrand .
it' s about pignon .
yes ?
it' s a bit tricky .
you must stop fondling him .
sorry ?
he' s accused you of sexual harassment .
he accused me of ...
that faggot !
precisely .
sexual harassment ?
since he doesn' t like women , leave him alone !
yes , sir .
tons of men in this company would love to be harassed by you !
i' il go for a breather .
what you did to her is disgusting !
i didn' t do anything ...
you behaved like an old biddy !
soon you' il have no friends here !
fran ?
ois ?
it' s for you .
what is it ?
open it !
happy birthday , fran ?
ois .
hope you like the color , but you can change it .
you okay ?
yeah .
sure you had no school ?
yeah .
you should see your dad more often .
that thing' il make you a zombie !
you don' t even answer his calls .
he' s no longer my husband ... but he' s still your father !
i' m not an idiot .
you left him ...
' cause he' s a drag .
he still is , so i dodge him .
now please leave me alone .
tell him you hate his pasta .
i don' t hate it .
if you don' t , where' s the problem ?
it' s how he says , " tomato and basil pasta !
that' s him .
we won' t change him .
can i go next week instead ?
don' t annoy me !
tomato and basil pasta !
smells delicious !
sweet of you to invite me .
i' d made too much for myself .
delicious !
may i say ... it lacks a little basil .
what it lacks is the presence of my son .
things okay ?
sure .
nice day at the office ?
ice !
i asked a question .
yes , fine .
water !
want to hear about my day ?
i' m back from work .
i' m bushed .
lay off me .
what is it ?
you' ve been odd all week .
you don' t answer me or you get mad .
what is it , hon ?
nothing .
i' m fine .
good bye .
what' s this bill ?
the cashmere house .
one sweater , $110 !
you bought one ?
yes .
so what ?
you got a cashmere sweater ?
they also sell lisle .
it was on sale . $110 !
that' s cheap ?
it was for that color .
what color ?
pink .
you gonna grill me long ?
i want to see it .
is it in your closet ?
no , i checked .
stop poisoning my life !
admit you bought a sweater for a bimbo !
a sweater for a bimbo ?
she' s nuts !
so put it on .
i want to see you in it .
who' s this girl ?
this gift wasn' t for a girl .
then for who ?
a guy at the plant .
a pink sweater for a guy at the plant ?
he' s gay .
it was his birthday .
now leave me alone .
you gave a sweater to a gay guy ?
who is this girl ?
did you watch tv last night ?
no , i ate at my sister in law' s .
there was a great movie .
a girl falls for a guy .
turns out he' s her dad .
that' s rough .
when the chick screamed , " daddy ! " ... she was so moving .
little bitch had great tits too !
really nice ones ?
some cleavage !
finding out the chick you want to lay is your daughter !
that' s a real human interest story .
here he comes !
what happened ?
two guys in the garage ...
i' il call the police .
no point .
we' il get the bastards .
they wore hoods and stole nothing .
i' il take you to the hospital .
i' il be okay .
i thought those days were over .
you again !
because you showed up ...
i' m in this mess ... pretending to be what i' m not , getting beaten up .
i' d be out of work , but whole .
hear that , puss ?
you seduced an old queer , wrecked his neighbor' s life .
look what you' ve done to him , puss .
make fun of me too !
would you rather i wept ?
heard the latest ?
now what ?
he got beaten up in his garage .
two hooded guys .
broken collarbone .
wasn' t me .
i was home .
i didn' t say that it was .
was he robbed ?
no , just beat up .
a way to say they hate gays .
that' s disgusting .
is he in the hospital ?
i think he' s at home .
should i call him ?
if you want , yes .
if he' s all alone at home , i' d better go see him .
don' t lose any sleep .
it can' t be that bad .
agnes won' t speak to me .
who ?
my wife .
because i bought him a sweater .
would you give chocolates ?
to your wife ?
no , to pignon .
we went too far .
maybe he' s in love .
i' m not kidding .
he looked odd .
if he looked less dumb , that' s progress .
he' s figured it out .
now he' s putting you on .
he may be more fragile than we thought .
who are they for ?
what are you doing here ?
we have to talk .
shit , my chocolates !
you followed me ?
yes .
' cause of a girl ?
if you knew ...
i do .
you' re courting a gay man to keep your job .
that' s worse than a girlfriend .
i can' t give him these .
you buy that faggot sweaters and chocolates !
next a venice weekend !
don' t tail me !
i' il do what i want !
leave me alone !
you' re sick .
you need help .
you' il wind up feeding that man chocolates .
they' re wrecked !
he' il ask you to lie beside him .
no chance of that .
how do you know ?
i' m not his type .
he avoids my eyes .
he never wore my sweater .
i don' t appeal to him .
come home .
you need help .
i love you .
i need a candy store .
i can' t give him these .
if you go up to his place , i' il leave you .
there must be a candy store .
felix !
had a problem ?
nothing serious .
fran ?
ois pignon ?
the boss wants to see you .
come up now .
the boss ?
i' il be right up .
my dear fran ?
ois , have a seat !
you' re hurt ?
it' s nothing .
glad to hear it .
we' re going to need you .
moreau' s come up with a good publicity stunt .
he' il tell you .
go ahead .
as you may know , next saturday is gay pride day .
what ?
the day you guys have a big parade .
radio and tv , all the media cover it now .
i suggested that we should be in on it .
i was reluctant .
we still have a few heterosexual customers .
but your parade is now so accepted socially .
we' ve got a float in the parade ... with a banner and a big condom .
i thought you' d like to be on the float .
me ?
we' ve got a " come out safely " t shirt .
and this hat to top it off .
a perfect fit !
isn' t he cute ?
how you doing ?
we' re fine , but he isn' t .
his wife left him .
shit .
we' ve been assholes .
hi , felix .
you okay ?
fine , sure .
i have to talk to you .
i' il come clean .
i kidded you .
your job was always safe .
i had fun scaring you , but only so you' d evolve .
some of us disapproved of your macho attitude .
so we said , " let' s tone him down .
see ?
we heard your wife left you .
we feel bad .
no need .
we want your wife to come home again .
not too mad at me ?
i' m not mad at you .
why should i be ?
good .
we love you .
we were just teasing .
so you' re shy .
you' il overcome that .
you' re the man for that float , no ?
but crowds , spotlights , parades aren' t my thing .
the ceo will be upset if you refuse .
it was his idea .
agnes moved out .
what ?
my wife left me .
now i live alone .
really ?
i need an answer fast .
agnes has left me .
i' m alone .
yes , i heard you .
want a coffee ?
you want to live with me ?
i' m alone .
we could live together .
no .
why ?
because .
it took eight people to control him .
he went berserk .
poor fellow .
he' s in the hospital with a nervous breakdown .
what a day !
you better ?
yes .
as to that parade , if i were you , i' d go .
that' s easy for you to say .
what a dumb answer .
if you go ... you' il become irreplaceable , a kind of icon .
yes , an icon .
in a parade of flamers .
wearing a condom bonnet .
so what ?
i' il be a dickhead .
to you it' s funny .
screw your parade !
as you like .
i' m tired .
i' m going to bed .
sorry .
i was tactless , but i' m lost too .
more has happened in the last few days than in my whole life .
don' t exaggerate .
one coworker undressed me .
another wanted me to move in , then almost strangled me .
i got beat up in my garage .
next , i parade with fags and dykes .
need i say more ?
your life' s been very dull .
at last , you' re coming alive .
don' t quit halfway .
good to see you , darling .
you okay , dad ?
fine .
come in , frank .
sit down .
i' ve made you a snack .
tomato and basil pasta .
i wasn' t expecting your message .
i haven' t heard from you in a month .
you' re not eating ?
i' m not hungry .
i' m fine .
i' m really fine .
i saw you on tv .
it was luck .
i rarely watch daytime tv .
that' s why you came over ?
i had to see you .
why ?
it made me want to see you .
you see dad in a parade of flamers and say , " i' il pop over .
no , i said , " maybe i misread dad .
great pasta .
maybe you misread me ?
i said , maybe he' s not such a ...
a drag ?
yes ...
i mean more fun .
now you think i' m fun ?
don' t know .
i' m just glad to be with you .
that parade today , me on a float with that banner ...
it was brilliant .
what did you want to say ?
nothing .
i' m glad you came .
tell me ... are you attracted to ...
to what ?
you mean , to boys ?
why , is it hereditary ?
i' m not kidding .
answer me .
no .
i' m into girls .
pity , we' il never parade together .
what' s that ?
good stuff .
you smoke that crap ?
sometimes , not often .
don' t worry .
does your mom know ?
i said i rarely do .
only when i feel great .
tonight we both feel great , right ?
we feel great , but don' t smoke this crap .
why so late ?
i was worried sick !
i was with dad .
what ?
i had dinner with dad .
don' t lie to me .
i swear we had dinner .
did you leave him ' cause he' s gay ?
what ?
you could' ve told me .
are you drunk ?
i taped it .
i missed the start , but he' s brilliant .
we' re not in , but leave us a message .
christine , it' s me .
you there ?
you' re not in ?
you' re there .
it' s so good to hear you .
you okay ?
very well .
i had dinner with frank .
he told me .
did he tell you about ...
yes .
i' m watching it on tv .
a rerun ?
what channel ?
no , he recorded it .
what is all this ?
don' t bug him .
he' s found his thing .
he' s happy .
stay out of it .
go to bed .
have you become gay ?
it' s a complicated story .
don' t bug him .
he was cool tonight .
not uptight ...
get off my back !
no , that was for frank , not you .
can we meet ?
sure we can .
dinner one night this week ?
she' il bug the hell out of him .
shut your trap !
and she' s crude too .
i' il call tomorrow to say which night .
i saw my son .
i' m dining with my wife .
you' re a genius !
i' m happy for you .
what' s happened ?
you look down .
the cat ran away .
where to ?
it left no forwarding address .
of course .
may i come in ?
why am i so upset ?
it wasn' t here long .
such an ordinary cat .
don' t worry .
we' il find it .
i' il put up posters all over with a description .
a description ?
yes , its particulars .
okay , describe it to me .
what ?
describe the cat to me .
it' s small , gray ...
yes , they' re sure to find it .
add that it meows now and again .
you lived with it .
aren' t there any markings ?
nothing .
you couldn' t find a more anonymous alley cat .
but i' m glad about your son and your wife .
i' il find your cat .
i' il search every alley around .
morning .
morning .
how are you ?
just fine .
what is it ?
nothing .
are you sure ?
yes .
why ?
a dark look from you , the boss' s secretary ...
things are fine .
miss bertrand .
the ceo is planning ... to promote pignon .
coffee , anyone ?
no coffee .
you knew ?
knew what ?
i' ve been fired .
the parade boosted the company' s image .
you' ve got my job as head accountant .
they can' t fire you like that .
officially , it' s sexual harassment .
nice going .
i want to see the ceo .
he' s busy .
sorry , but i have to talk to you .
call you back .
i' ve called security .
no need .
got a problem ?
yes .
i heard i was being promoted .
news travels fast here .
there is talk of promoting you .
but that can' t be it .
you cannot fire miss bertrand .
she' s an excellent head accountant .
fire me .
it' s okay .
no one' s being fired .
anyone for coffee ?
yes .
i' d like some coffee .
me too .
three coffees coming right up .
pignon !
you okay , felix ?
you came to see me , wearing my sweater !
it' s lovely .
i get compliments .
i thought you' d like this key ring .
a little rugby ball !
that' s neat !
i started a team here , but the depressives were too weepy .
that' s a shame .
crying in a scrum , you can' t see the ball .
come back to work .
i can' t .
i was fired .
no , the boss agrees , we' il never find a personnel man like you .
or such a good rugby coach .
don' t , fran ?
ois .
my eyes are moist , like a fairy .
sorry .
no harm done .
come back soon .
promise ?
i promise .
it' s too pink .
makes you look silly .
exchange it .
see you soon .
what time' s the party ?
ready !
he' s coming !
there' s a party for me ?
don' t think so .
i knew it , you did .
i feel ill .
why ?
i' m still shaky .
i feel weak .
it' il be fine .
give me your hand .
is pignon holding santini' s hand ?
he is !
congratulations , felix .
pignon and santini .
who could' ve guessed ?
what are you doing here ?
hanging around .
i didn' t feel like going home .
and you ?
i followed you , to thank you .
there' s no need .
and to apologize .
what for ?
for six years i saw you as a dullard ... with no brawn or brains , no balls , nothing .
no need .
that' s how everyone sees me .
one day , i saw a photo of you , bare assed , being felt up by a gay .
here , they found it amazing or amusing .
i figured , it' s a crafty ploy to keep his job .
you were right .
no , i was wrong .
you' d found a ploy , but you' re not a dullard .
you' re a fine man .
convincing you of that is the best way to thank you .
convincing me will be quite a chore .
i promise to do my best .
i' m dining with my wife tomorrow .
she left me two years ago , never saw me .
now she' s agreed , intrigued by this gay thing .
i' m scared of being alone with her .
i' il be hopeless .
has she replaced you ?
several times .
several times isn' t serious .
have you had an affair ?
no .
other women don' t interest me .
that' s not good .
why ?
won' t help you get her back .
women spot a lonely man .
it drives them away .
they also sense when a man has known many women ... and it excites them .
if it' s just to thank me ...
you got any protection ?
no .
me , neither .
usually i have some in my purse ...
these are our assembly lines and our packaging lines .
and those ...
those are our testers .
madame .
morning , gentlemen .
i' m confused about pignon' s sexuality .
things okay ?
amazing .
i waited so long for this .
what' s this place ?
a guy from the office took me here .
it' s a bit rustic .
a bit .
you don' t like it ?
rich food .
i' il have a salad .
shall we move ?
i just came for an explanation .
go ahead .
you only came for that ?
why else ?
sure .
care for a drink , folks ?
champagne ?
no , bottled water .
yes , madame .
for you , sir ?
glass of champagne .
what' s all this that you' re gay ?
for two years , i was so terribly stuck on you .
mornings , waking without you .
i' d talk all day to you .
at night , sleepless , i' d still talk to you .
i only quit when i phoned you .
you never answered .
let' s not go over all that again .
in my head , i asked you why you' d left me ... when i loved you so much ... and i had tried so hard to make you happy .
i saw shrinks who said i was an obsessive compulsive .
they named my pain but couldn' t cure it .
god , how i loved you .
i agreed to come because i saw you in a gay parade .
you said you' d explain .
i will .
don' t worry .
i' m happy .
i' m really happy tonight .
why ?
i' ve realized how unpleasant you are .
you' re amazingly unpleasant , i' d even say .
and forgive my frankness ... but you' re totally uninteresting .
if you invited me to insult me ...
don' t get mad .
i' m just starting to breathe .
after two years , i' m breathing again .
i choked in my obsessive period .
i forgot who you were ... an ungenerous woman who never gave me any love ... not even a tiny bit .
you' re so uninteresting , and now i' m so happy .
that' s it .
i' m leaving .
i' m not gay .
i did it for my job and your alimony .
pretending not to like women , i became a man .
call your son .
fill him in on this hoax .
for three days he' s treated you like a hero .
you mind ?
what ?
that he no longer scorns me , that i interest him .
it bothers you ?
a boy shouldn' t admire his dad for acting like a fag .
telling him will be a letdown .
i' il tell him .
things will be fine again .
sorry , you' re dining alone .
we smoked a joint together .
what ?
hash .
it was good stuff .
my head was putty the next day .
what did you say ?
i forbid you to tell him what i really am .
he' s at a critical stage .
we' il tell him later .
i want contact .
you' re raising him wrong .
he needs a father , gay or straight .
you decided , folks ?
i' il have some rich , heavy food .
madame won' t .
i' m dining alone .
good night .
it' s been lovely .
amazing !
i can' t believe it .
i said i' d find it .
it was on your balcony ?
yes .
i heard meows and ...
when ?
a while ago .
funny , i didn' t hear a thing .
i did it .
i' m over my wife .
that' s good news .
our dinner ...
it wasn' t " ours .
she didn' t eat .
sure it' s the same cat ?
what ?
there' s something different .
like what ?
i can' t describe it .
the other was very plain .
so' s this one .
that proves nothing .
either way .
you' re not the same man .
i don' t know which is which .
i' il get to the point , pignon .
i don' t know where things stand with you .
two months ago , you come out of the closet .
you agree ?
yes , sir .
then you accused miss bertrand of sexual harassment .
you still agree ?
yes , sir .
later , i catch you making wild love ... on an assembly line with that same miss bertrand ... in front ofjapanese clients ... who now want to visit the plant again .
you think it' s funny .
i don' t .
you pretended to be gay to hold on to your job .
you' re a liar , pignon .
you' re right , sir , i' m a liar .
i' m not gay .
do i apply for unemployment ?
that' s not the right approach .
yes , it is , sir .
gay or straight , you' re a pain , pignon .
my whole life i' ve been called a drag .
you called me a pain .
that' s a step up the ladder .
one year later ...
all right , please .
please !
a company photo .
so everyone smiles ... happy to be in this fine outfit .
the man down on the left .
you in the blue suit .
i' m not in the frame ?
you okay ?
shit , my collarbone !
okay , fire away .
